Page  7 of 76 2.0 Introduction 
 
This study is sponsored by [CONTACT_150848] 
(MAPS), a US-based, IRS-approved, 501(c)3 non-profit research and educational 
organization. MAPS sponsors clinical research evaluating the potential of psychedelics 
and marijuana to become FDA-approved generic prescription medicines. MAPS is 
currently sponsoring a series of Phase 2 pi[INVESTIGATOR_150811]-resistant posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The ongoing Phase 2 program 
includes multiple active protocols investigating the therapeutic potential of 3,4-
methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)-assisted psychotherapy in treating people 
with chronic, treatment-resistant PTSD. Results from two MAPS-supported studies of 
MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for PTSD have recently been published and include 
indications that the treatment can create durable improvements in PTSD symptom 
severity [1-3]. This study will continue MAPS investigation into the treatment of PTSD 
with the first randomized controlled trial (RCT) to test the therapeutic potential of 
smoked marijuana and its components as a treatment for PTSD. This study is essential for 
understanding potential risks and therapeutic benefits of marijuana for PTSD patients.  
 
MAPS is seeking to conduct the marijuana/PTSD pi[INVESTIGATOR_150812], treatment-resistant PTSD, including veterans with service-
related PTSD [4]. As of December 2014, [ADDRESS_173920] PTSD as a qualifying condition for 
medical marijuana, including Arizona but not Maryland [5]. As of August 18, 2010, 633 
of a total of 2316 individuals enrolled in the New Mexico medical marijuana program 
(27%) list PTSD as the primary condition they seek to treat with medical marijuana [6], 
making it the most common reason for enrollment. Similar prevalence has been observed 
in other states and among other populations, including military veterans [7, 8]. At present, 
there are no published data from randomized, placebo-controlled studies of the risks and 
benefits of marijuana for participants with chronic PTSD from any cause.  
 
In this groundbreaking randomized, triple-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study, 
marijuana will be tested as a pharmacological agent to manage PTSD symptoms in [ADDRESS_173921] of the chemical composition of marijuana, specifically ∆-9-tetrahydrocannabinol 
(THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) content, on clinical outcomes.  
 
2.1 Protocol Purpose 
 
This pi[INVESTIGATOR_150813], treatment-resistant PTSD among 
veterans. By [CONTACT_150849], we address a national 
emergency and limit variability at the potential expense of generalizability. Further 
MAPS Study MJP-1   Amendment 5 Version 1  
US  June 28, 2016  
 
Page  8 of 76 research will be needed to determine if these results will apply to other groups of PTSD 
sufferers. Smoked marijuana will be tested in two stages of three weeks each (Stage 1 and 
Stage 2), with a two-week cessation after each stage, verified by [CONTACT_41225]/urine cannabinoid 
analysis. The study will produce preliminary evidence to help elucidate the contribution 
of THC, CBD, or a combination of both constituents to potential attenuation of PTSD 
symptoms.  This study is critically important for understanding the potential risks and 
benefits of marijuana as a treatment for PTSD and can inform the development of larger 
randomized controlled clinical trials. Ad-libitum  self-administration of smoked marijuana 
with a range of THC and CBD ratios will be used in this study to provide a naturalistic 
comparison that is generalizable to what many veterans are currently using to manage 
PTSD symptoms in states with legalized medical marijuana. Results will provide 
information regarding marijuana dosing, composition, side effects, and specific areas of 
benefit to clinicians and legislators considering marijuana as an acceptable treatment for 
PTSD. This study will also provide information on the predictive value and/or assessment 
of the impact of marijuana on selected biomarkers of inflammation, and effects of 
marijuana concentration upon these biomarkers as a measure of PTSD treatment 
response.  
  
2.2 Supporting Information   
 
2.2.1 Condition 
 
PTSD is a serious, worldwide public health problem for which a wider array of effective 
treatments is needed. In the US, the lifetime prevalence of PTSD in the general 
population is between 6 and 10% [9, 10]. PTSD is common in other countries as well 
[11-15]. Incidence of PTSD in US Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and Operation 
Enduring Freedom (OEF) veterans is as high as 18% [16], and it is estimated that the 
number of service members returning home with PTSD will be between 75,000 and 
225,000 [17]. In 2004, the US Veterans Administration (VA) spent $4.[ADDRESS_173922] of them from the Vietnam 
War [18].  Due to OIF/OEF, the number of veterans disabled by [CONTACT_150850], and the cost of 
providing disability payments, has increased substantially since 2004.  In countries where 
there is endemic armed conflict, the incidence of PTSD in civilians is often far greater 
[19-21].  PTSD is typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] a chronic illness [22, 23], associated with high rates of 
psychiatric and medical co-morbidity, disability, suffering and suicide [13, 22, 24, 25].  
An array of psychotherapeutic options exists for treating PTSD that include cognitive 
behavioral psychotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], such as Prolonged Exposure (PE), Cognitive Reprocessing 
Therapy (CPT), and therapi[INVESTIGATOR_150814] 
(EMDR) [26, 27], as well as two Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs; 
sertraline and paroxetine) that are approved as PTSD treatments by [CONTACT_1622]. However, a 
significant percentage of PTSD patients fail to respond adequately to established PTSD 
psychotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] [28, 29], including SSRIs [30], or respond in ways that are statistically 
significant but clinically inadequate. At least one study of paroxetine indicated that men 
with PTSD did not respond to this drug [31].  These findings suggest that there is still 
substantial need for innovative treatments for PTSD.  
 
MAPS Study MJP-[ADDRESS_173923], but not all, RCTs with combat (mostly Vietnam War) veterans 
showed less treatment efficacy than RCTs with non-veterans whose PTSD was related to 
other traumatic experiences. Therefore some experts believe that combat veterans with 
PTSD are less responsive to standard or widely used treatments. More clinical trials with 
combat veterans would be important and welcome additions to this literature [26].    
 
Clinical reports suggest that patients with PTSD may have a tendency to favor 
depressants, such as alcohol, benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], and marijuana to “self-medicate” 
symptoms of hyperarousal as opposed to stimulants (such as cocaine), which may 
exacerbate symptoms [32]. However, the extent to which illicit substances are used for 
symptom relieve in veterans with PTSD may be under-appreciated in clinical trials 
associated with the VA system [33-35]. Substance use in this group may be under-
reported due to concerns that it might jeopardize potential claims for disability 
compensation or result in arrest or prosecution. Thus there is potential benefit of 
conducting studies of PTSD and substance use outside of the VA system that include 
multimodal assessments and measures of both PTSD and substance use.   
 
2.2.[ADDRESS_173924] at the CB1 cannabinoid 
receptor. This receptor is found at high concentrations in the brain, including the basal 
ganglia and cerebellar regions, and also in the hippocampus and hypothalamus. THC has 
been shown to inhibit the release of a wide spectrum of neurotransmitters including L-
glutamate, GABA, norepi[INVESTIGATOR_238], dopamine, serotonin (5-HT), and acetylcholine [36]. 
Preliminary findings from assessing current and recalled PTSD symptoms in 80 patients 
suggests that use of medical marijuana can reduce PTSD symptoms [37], and a case 
study of a young man with PTSD assessed before and after he began using cannabis 
supports the therapeutic potential of marijuana for PTSD [38]. An open-label study in ten 
people reported that sublingual THC reduced PTSD symptoms, reduced nightmares and 
improved sleep quality [39]. Given evidence highlighting marijuana as a possible means 
of improving sleep [4], with retrospective reports of marijuana use and associated 
psychopathology indicating reductions in PTSD symptoms after use [37], it is not 
surprising that population-based studies have found PTSD to be associated with increased 
marijuana use [40]. These reports warrant further systematic investigation into marijuana 
as a potential adjunctive treatment for PTSD.  
 
The presence of CB1 receptors in the hippocampus, amygdala, prefrontal and anterior 
cingulate cortex suggests that endocannabinoids are involved in regulating anxiety, 
attention to and response to stressful situations, and may be involved in the extinction of 
conditioned fear [41-43]. This hypothesis is supported by [CONTACT_150851]1 receptors is particularly elevated among individuals with PTSD, compared to 
trauma-exposed or healthy controls [44]. Further support of this theory came from studies 
using CB1 receptor antagonists or CB1 receptor knockout mice. Several CB1 receptor 
agonists increased time mice spent in open arms of the elevated plus maze, a sign of 
MAPS Study MJP-1   Amendment 5 Version 1  
US  June 28, 2016  
 
Page  10 of 76 reduced anxiety [45], while CB1 receptor antagonist SR141716 produced anxiogenic 
effects in the elevated plus-maze and the defensive withdrawal tests in adult rats [46, 47]. 
Furthermore, another selective CB1 receptor antagonist, AM251, increased anxiety-like 
behavior in wild-type mice but had no effect in the knockouts, in support of a CB1 
receptor-mediated  anxiolysis.  
 
Cannabinoids also modulate GABA-ergic transmission and the release of cholecystokinin 
(CCK), a peptide that may contribute to both anxiolytic and anxiogenic effects of THC 
and endocannabinoids [48-51]. Furthermore, cannabinoids enhance the release of 
endogenous opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], and these may be involved in the functional interplay between the 
endocannabinoid and the opi[INVESTIGATOR_150815]. Some 
researchers hypothesize that the relationship between these two systems plays a role in 
antidepressant-like effects and in various addiction-related processes [52-54]. Studies in 
rodents suggest that cannabinoids and their interaction with endogenous opi[INVESTIGATOR_150816] [53, 55, 56]. Rodent studies detected antidepressant-like responses 
to CB1 agonists, and CB1 agonists can increase the synaptic concentration of biogenic 
amines, much like antidepressants do. Thus, pharmacological modulation of the 
endocannabinoid system holds considerable promise in the treatment of both anxiety-
related and mood disorders. 
 
The results of a recent study implicated endocannabinoids and CB1 receptors in the 
extinction of aversive memories by [CONTACT_150852]1 knockout mice show 
impaired extinction in auditory fear-conditioning tests, and this could be mimicked in 
wild-type mice by [CONTACT_150853]141716 [57], a finding supported through use of 
receptor agonists and antagonists [58, 59]. The synthetic cannabinoid nabilone was 
effective in reducing treatment-resistant nightmares in people with PTSD [60]. These 
findings raise the possibility that pharmacological amplification of CB1 signaling, for 
example, may have therapeutic value in obsessive-compulsive disorder or PTSD. 
 
Benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_150817]. Other treatments, such as the centrally acting adrenergic alpha1 
antagonist prazosin, have been investigated as a treatment for PTSD-related sleep 
disorders [61]. However, these compounds can produce physical dependence and are not 
always well tolerated. Investigating alternate avenues of treatment for PTSD symptoms 
may lead to helpi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a greater number of individuals control their symptoms.  
 
In addition to THC, whole plant marijuana contains a number of other active constituents, 
most notably CBD. Research indicates that THC acts upon receptors in brain areas 
involved in memory and fear processing, and preclinical studies in rodents suggest 
cannabinoids reduce fear [42, 45]. Research in mice found that CBD was comparable to 
the antidepressant imipramine in tests of antidepressant-like effects [62]. Findings of 
reduced PTSD symptoms, by [CONTACT_150854], including nightmares and sleep difficulties suggest a potential role for 
cannabinoids in the alleviation of PTSD symptoms [63, 64]. Further, CBD may oppose 
anxiogenic effects of THC in humans [65, 66], and a naturalistic study found smoking 
marijuana with higher CBD levels was associated with less memory impairment and 
lower anxiety during intoxication [67]. It appears that CBD attenuates amygdalar 
MAPS Study MJP-1   Amendment 5 Version 1  
US  June 28, 2016  
 
Page  11 of 76 activation in response to facial expressions of fear in healthy participants [68], a 
potentially beneficial effect for people with PTSD, who may exhibit enhanced amygdalar 
reactivity to fearful faces [69]. Anecdotal reports from Veterans Alliance for Medical 
Marijuana (VAMM) indicate that veterans prefer a balanced THC to CBD intake for 
management of PTSD symptoms. These studies suggest that it is worth investigating the 
effects of marijuana that varies in THC and CBD content on the ability to suppress 
symptoms of PTSD.  
 
Another potential mechanism by [CONTACT_150855]. A longitudinal study in US Marines reported 
an association between higher pre-deployment levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and 
post-deployment development of PTSD [70]. In other research, reduction in PTSD 
symptoms following treatment with SSRIs was associated with a reduction in interleukin-
1Beta  (IL-1β) [71], and women whose PTSD symptoms were in remission exhibited 
lower levels of CRP and interleukin-6 (IL-6) compared with those with current PTSD 
[72]. Further, a meta-analysis supported a link between IL-1β and IL-6 and exposure to 
trauma [73], with stress-related elevation in IL-6 potentially higher among those with 
PTSD [72, 74]. Because both THC and CBD have potent anti-inflammatory and 
immunomodulatory properties [75, 76], marijuana use may have therapeutic benefit in 
PTSD treatment simply via reductions in inflammation. Biomarkers of inflammation will 
be assessed to investigate whether the anti-inflammatory properties of THC/CBD 
mediates the treatment effect of marijuana on PTSD symptom expression.  
 
2.3 Rationale for Concentration Selection 
 
Four potencies of marijuana obtained through the National Institute on Drug Abuse 
(NIDA) drug supply program that vary in THC and cannabidiol CBD content will be 
used: High THC/ Low CBD ( High THC ), Low THC/High CBD ( High CBD ), High 
THC/High CBD ( THC/CBD ) or Low THC/Low CBD ( placebo) marijuana. “High” is 
defined as marijuana containing a target of 9-15% concentration by [CONTACT_150856] “Low” is defined as <2% concentration by [CONTACT_8497]; actual 
cannabinoid concentrations are subject to the capabilities of the NIDA Drug Supply 
Program to produce different strains of marijuana based on these targets and are provided 
in Section 6. In the Stage 2 crossover, two of three concentrations will be compared: 
High THC, High CBD, and THC/CBD. Ad-libitum  self-administration will be permitted 
up to a maximum of 1.8 grams of marijuana/day.  
 
The doses of marijuana (excluding placebo) in this study were chosen because they 
contain a range of THC and CBD ratios and potencies generalizable to what many 
veterans are currently using to manage PTSD symptoms in non-clinical settings in states 
with legalized medical marijuana.  Prior to the study start, laboratory testing of the study 
marijuana will be completed to verify the chemical composition of each concentration 
group.  
 
The active (non-placebo) doses are expected to produce commonly reported subjective 
effects of marijuana. The physiological effects are expected to be tolerable based on 
previous observational studies in the literature. The placebo is expected to produce 
MAPS Study MJP-[ADDRESS_173925] naturalistic comparison to real 
world examples of smoked marijuana.  
 
3.0 Protocol Objectives 
 
The objectives of this study are to evaluate whether i) smoking whole plant marijuana 
attenuates PTSD symptoms, ii) to compare the efficacy of varying ratios of THC and 
CBD to placebo using standard clinical measures, and to iii) collect safety data. 
 
3.1 Primary Objective 
 
To compare independent effects of three active concentrations of smoked marijuana and 
placebo on PTSD symptom severity measured by [CONTACT_120572]-5 total scores during 
3-weeks of ad-libitum  self-administration during Stage 1 of the study protocol .  
 
3.2 Secondary Objectives 
 
The following secondary objectives will be used to support the results of the primary 
objective: 
 
1. Assess independent effects of three active concentrations of marijuana and 
placebo in reducing self-reported symptoms of PTSD with the PCL-5, anxiety and 
depression with the IDAS, and improving psychosocial functioning with the IPF 
and WBR (self-report and observer) among veterans during Stage 1. 
2. Assess independent effects of three active concentrations of marijuana and 
placebo in reducing self-reported symptoms of PTSD with PCL-5, anxiety and 
depression with IDAS, and improving psychosocial functioning with the IPF and 
WBR (self-report and observer) among veterans during Stage 2.  
3. Assess comparative efficacy between placebo and each active dose of marijuana 
based on a within-subjects analysis of PTSD symptoms as measured by [CONTACT_150857]-5 in crossover participants at Baseline, End of Stage 1, Stage 2 Baseline, 
and End of Stage 2. 
4. Assess whether Stage 2 crossover participants’ preferences for marijuana 
concentrations in Stage 1 and Stage 2 correlate with reduction in PTSD symptoms 
as measured by [CONTACT_25905]-5 total score.  
5. Assess whether participants experience a clinically significant increase in PTSD 
symptoms based on CAPS-5 and PCL-5 total scores during the washout period 
between Stage 1 and Stage 2 compared with measures assessed at Baseline and 
during Stage 1.  
6. Explore correlation of treatment outcomes measured by [CONTACT_88853]-5 score with 
objective changes in sleep via Actigraphy throughout the study and self-reported 
MAPS Study MJP-1   Amendment 5 Version 1  
US  June 28, 2016  
 
Page  13 of 76 changes in sleep quality using the ISI on a weekly basis. 
7. Explore correlation of Daily Diary items related to sleep with objective changes in 
sleep via Actigraphy and self-reported changes in sleep quality using the ISI on a 
weekly basis. 
8. Explore correlation of treatment effects measured by [CONTACT_88853]-5 total score with 
amount of marijuana used based on Daily Diary across Stage 1 and Stage 2. 
9. Explore treatment outcomes measured by [CONTACT_88853]-5 total score by [CONTACT_150858], with concomitant substance and medication use as a covariate 
throughout the treatment period. 
10. Explore durability of treatment outcomes measured by [CONTACT_88853]-5 total score, with 
any PTSD treatments based on the LTFU questionnaire treated as a covariate, six 
months after completing Stage 2. 
 
3.3 Safety Objectives 
 
The safety of participants will be measured throughout the study by [CONTACT_150859], psychological distress, adverse events (AEs), 
and suicidality, repeatedly as described in the following steps.  Summaries of safety data 
by [CONTACT_150860].   
 
1. Explore correlations of subjective effects with the DEQ and cardiovascular effects 
with heart rate of each active dose of marijuana and placebo during introductory 
sessions. 
2. Explore independent effects of each active dose of marijuana and placebo on 
blood pressure and body temperature during introductory sessions. 
3. Assess independent effects of each active dose of marijuana and placebo on 
marijuana withdrawal symptoms during screening and Cessation [ADDRESS_173926], review, and report Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) and AEs in 
accordance with FDA regulations and Section 8.0 of the protocol.  
 
MAPS Study MJP-1   Amendment 5 Version 1  
US  June 28, 2016  
 
Page  14 of 76 3.4 Process Objectives 
 
The following objectives will include exploratory analyses intended to inform future 
studies: 
 
1. Evaluate protocol compliance based on comparison of Daily Diary entries, 
including information on amount, time and frequency of marijuana use, and the 
weight of any unused marijuana across each study stage. 
2. Evaluate protocol compliance using quantitative blood and/or urine cannabinoid 
levels. 
3. Evaluate whether markers of inflammation CRP, IL-1β, and IL-[ADDRESS_173927] PTSD severity at baseline and treatment outcome as a function of 
marijuana concentration. 
 Assess the ability of site staff and participants to accurately guess condition 
assignment in Stage 1 and Stage 2. 

study training, and ensure participants are willing and able to attend scheduled 
appointments and complete the study procedures.  
 
Following randomization, participants will complete Stage 1, a three-week period of ad-
libitum marijuana self-administration followed by a two-week period of marijuana 
abstinence (Cessation 1). This will be immediately followed by [CONTACT_37325] 2, another three-
week period of marijuana self-administration and two-week period of abstinence 
(Cessation 2).  Stage [ADDRESS_173929] of identical procedures and measures, but 
the marijuana available to individual participants will vary.   
 
During Stage 1, participants will be randomized to receive High THC, High CBD, 
THC/CBD, or Placebo marijuana to self-administer (up to 1.8 g/day) for the 3-week 
marijuana use period.  As described in Section 4.2, randomization will be balanced across 
drug conditions (N=19 per marijuana type; total N=76).  During Stage 2, the Placebo 
marijuana condition will be removed and all participants will be re-randomized to receive 
a different type of marijuana than they were assigned in Stage 1. Thus, Stage [ADDRESS_173930] more than two months.  
 
There will be a long-term follow-up assessment conducted six months after the end of 
Stage 2. Participants will complete the long-term follow-up questionnaire concerning 
their mental health, substance use, and changes in PTSD therapi[INVESTIGATOR_19080]. A 
blinded Independent Rater (IR) will administer the CAPS-5. Participants will complete 
self-report measures and one week of Actigraphy (ACT) monitoring, followed by [CONTACT_150861]. 
 
4.1 Planned Duration of Study 
 
Study duration for each participant will be eight and a half months from the time the 
participant is enrolled in the study. The study will start after marijuana is obtained from 
the NIDA Drug Supply Program, and composition may be verified by [CONTACT_150862]. Assuming that eight participants can be enrolled each month across 
sites, the study should take approximately two years to complete.  
 
4.2 Randomization and Participant Numbering 
 
To achieve sufficient statistical power and account for dropouts, about 116 participants 
will be stratified by [CONTACT_150863] a 1:1:1:1 ratio across the four treatment 
groups (High THC, High CBD, THC/CBD, or Placebo) based on a sequential order of 
enrollment into the study.  Participants will be assigned a randomization code that will 
correspond to a blinded condition assignment. Randomization and enrollment will halt 
when 76 participants complete Stage 1 (at least N=19 per group). In order to maintain the 
blind for participants, site staff, IRs, and sponsor staff, a central electronic database will 
be utilized for randomization based on validated computer-generated lists. The Stage [ADDRESS_173931] will utilize blocks to balance treatment assignments. Stage 2 
randomization will utilize multiple validated randomization lists that re-randomize 
participants in a blinded manner to one of two new treatment assignments in a 1:1 ratio, 
excluding the previously assigned Stage 1 dose and the placebo condition as possibilities. 
 
The blind may be broken for an individual participant if there is an AE or other 
emergency requiring knowledge of the participant's marijuana condition assignment. This 
emergency unblinding would require approval from the site CI and Coordinating 
Investigator. For this purpose, the Randomization Monitor will provide dose assignment 
through the electronic randomization system. In all other cases, the blind will be 
maintained until all participants have completed the study and the database is locked.  
The Coordinating Investigator, Co-investigator, CIs, IR, and participant will be blind to 
condition assignment.

Page  16 of 76 Prior to enrollment, participants at Site 01 will be tracked with a screening number 
assigned sequentially starting at "S1001," and participants at Site 02 will be tracked with 
a screening number assigned sequentially starting at "S2001." Participants who meet 
eligibility criteria will be enrolled in the study and assigned a five-digit participant 
number. The first two digits will be “01 or 02” and will identify the study site. The next 
three digits identify the participant within the site and will be assigned sequentially, with

veterans’ organizations, advertisements or announcements placed in appropriate locations 
or on appropriate internet sites and the sponsor website, and word of mouth.   
 
Study volunteers will be interviewed by [CONTACT_150864]-approved phone script. If the prospective participant is 
eligible and interested in taking part in the study based on the telephone assessments, 
qualified site staff will continue phone prescreening and will provide them with consent 
materials for review and consideration. If, after review, an applicant remains eligible and 
interested in taking part in the study, an appointment will be made to obtain informed 
consent to participate and for a face-to-face screening assessment to further evaluate 
eligibility to participate. If the prospective participant is not eligible or interested in 
taking part in the study based on the telephone assessments and do not complete the 
consent process, documentation on eligibility information will be destroyed at the end of 
the study, apart from the summary reason for ineligibility, which will be retained on the 
Screening Log.  
 
Participants must be able to give adequate informed consent and be able to attend all 
required visits. Participants are required to pass an initial urine drug screen that is 
negative for opi[INVESTIGATOR_858], benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], cocaine, methamphetamines, THC, and 
amphetamines (unless prescribed), at the start of screening and agree to adhere to a 
minimum of two weeks abstinence from marijuana use prior to randomization. Cessation 
during the final two weeks of screening will be confirmed by [CONTACT_150865]/urine 
cannabinoid tests (methods described in Section 5.2.3 “Screen 2”)[77]. Participants must 
agree to use only the marijuana provided to them by [CONTACT_150866]. Participants must meet all study eligibility criteria by [CONTACT_150867]-week screening period in order to be eligible for enrollment.

5.0 Methods 
 
5.1 Assessments and Measures 
 
5.1.1 Outcome Measures 
 
Primary Outcome Measure:    
 
The Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS-5) [78] is a semi-structured clinical 
interview administered by a blinded IR and is used to assess index history of DSM-5-
defined traumatic event exposure [79], including the most distressing event, time since 
exposure, and total number of exposures, as well as frequency and severity of 
posttraumatic stress symptoms, as evidenced by [CONTACT_88853]-5 total score. The CAPS-5 
provides diagnostic status (presence versus absence) of PTSD as well as PTSD symptom 
severity. Changes in the CAPS-[ADDRESS_173939] size for this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]. The IR 
will administer the CAPS at visits described in the Time and Events table either in person 
or via telemedicine. IRs will receive training on administering this measure from a 
research reliable trainer. Interviews will be recorded in as many instances as necessary to 
establish reliability of a random selection of interviews for accuracy. The CAPS-5 will be 
MAPS Study MJP-1   Amendment 5 Version 1  
US  June 28, 2016  
 
Page  20 of 76 administered by [CONTACT_150871], who will be supervised by 
[CONTACT_5944].  
 
Secondary Outcome Measures:  
 
The PTSD Checklist (PCL-5) with LEC plus criterion A (at baseline only) [80] is a 20-item 
self-report questionnaire in which respondents indicate the presence and severity of PTSD 
symptoms, derived from the DSM-five symptoms of PTSD [79].  Participants indicate how 
much distress they have experienced due to symptoms such as “Repeated, disturbing 
memories, thoughts, or images of a stressful experience from the past,” “Trouble 
remembering important parts of a stressful experience from the past,” and “Feeling 
irritable or having angry outbursts” on a five-point Likert-type scale (1= not at all, 
5=extremely ). The total PCL-5 score (a sum of all 20 items) provides an index of overall 
PTSD symptom severity. 
 
The Inventory of Depression and Anxiety (IDAS) [81] is a 64-item self-report measure of 
depression and anxiety symptoms.  Factor analytic research indicates that the IDAS has 
strong convergent and discriminate validity, as well as criterion validity [82]. 
Additionally, factor analytic research indicates that the general depression and anxiety 
subscales of the IDAS differentiate anxiety from depression [81, 82].  
 
The Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) is a brief self-report measure of insomnia. It consists 
of seven questions, with responses made on a five-point Likert scale [83, 84]. Three items 
address difficulty at sleep onset, maintaining sleep and early waking, and four questions 
address perceived quality of sleep and effects of sleep difficulties on daily function.  
Questions are summed into a total score that ranges from 0 to 28 and can be interpreted 
as ranging from no signs of insomnia to severe insomnia. The ISI exhibits adequate to 
very good validity when compared with other self-report measures of sleep quality, 
statements concerning sleep quality and polysomnography, and is sensitive to changes in 
sleep quality  [84-86].  
 
Actigraphy (ACT) with ActiSleep and Monitor Actigraph devices will be used to 
measure objective sleep at baseline and all follow-up assessments. This noninvasive 
objective assessment device provides accurate and reliable measurements of sleep and 
wake including the following: amount of sleep, number and duration of awakenings, 
sleep efficiency, amount and intensity of physical activity, energy and activity, and sleep 
position. 
 
Weekly Behavior Report for Community Observers/Participants (WBR) is a 50-item 
questionnaire developed to assess current psychosocial functioning across seven 
domains: romantic relationships, family, work, education, social, self-care and alcohol 
and drug use. The community observer and participant would each complete the WBR in 
relation to the participant. The WBR will be completed based on the last seven days and 
will be administered according to the Time and Events Table. 
 
The Inventory of Psychosocial Functioning (IPF) [87] is an 80-item measure that that was 
developed for use among individuals with PTSD. It assesses current psychosocial 
MAPS Study MJP-1   Amendment 5 Version 1  
US  June 28, 2016  
 
Page  21 of 76 functioning across seven domains: romantic relationships, family, work, friendships, 
parenting, education, and self-care. Summation of scores across domains yields a total 
score for psychosocial functioning. The IPF has excellent psychometric properties [87]. 
 
5.1.2 Safety Measures 
 
The Time-Line Follow-Back (TLFB) method will be used to track medical and non-
medical drug/substance use [88, 89].  A retroactive TLFB assessment will be conducted 
to record substance use during the 90-days prior to the intake assessment during 
screening.  It will then be repeated at the six-month follow-up visit to collect substance 
and medication use for each day since the last visit.   
 
The Cannabis Use Disorders Identification Test-Revised (CUDIT-R) [90] is an eight-item 
self-report questionnaire used to assess problematic marijuana use within the past six-
months. Questions assess consumption (frequency), marijuana abuse (e.g., use in 
hazardous situations, inability to fulfill obligations), marijuana dependence (e.g., not able 
to stop using, spending a lot of time obtaining, using, or recovering from use), and 
negative consequences of use (e.g., problems with memory or concentration). Responses 
are summed, thus providing a continuous score of problematic marijuana use. The 
CUDIT has demonstrated high internal consistency and acceptable test-retest reliability, 
high specificity and sensitivity, as well as satisfactory predictive power [90]. 
 
The Marijuana Withdrawal Checklist (MWC) [91, 92] will be used to assess the presence 
of marijuana withdrawal symptoms during prior periods of abstinence.  The MWC will 
be labeled the Behavior Checklist to minimize expectancy effects.  It lists 32 symptoms 
for which participants indicate severity on a four-point scale (0=not at all, 1=mild, 
2=moderate, 3=severe).  The symptom list comprises the valid items found in prior 
marijuana withdrawal studies and additional non-specific items to minimize response 
bias.  During the intake assessment, participants will be instructed to indicate whether 
and to what degree they experienced each symptom during past periods of 
marijuana abstinence lasting at least [ADDRESS_173940] reliable marijuana withdrawal effects in several prior studies [91-96].  A total 
withdrawal discomfort score (WDS) will be computed from the Checklist and will be the 
outcome variable for this measure.  This summary score will include the symptoms 
reliably observed in prior marijuana withdrawal studies [97]. 
 
The Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) is a clinician-administered 
measure of suicidal behavior devised to detect potential suicidal thoughts or behaviors 
during a clinical trial [97]. It consists of a “Baseline” form that assesses lifetime suicidal 
ideation, intensity, and behavior, and a form for assessing current suicidal ideation and 
intensity. The C-SSRS consists of a series of questions, and can be administered via face-
to-face interview or over the telephone. The C-SSRS is a detailed interview, but the full 
interview is needed only if the initial screening questions about suicidal ideation and 
behavior are positive.  The screening questions should be completed for every participant 
MAPS Study MJP-1   Amendment 5 Version 1  
US  June 28, 2016  
 
Page  22 of 76 according to the Time and Events Table and as needed if the participant is showing any 
signs of being suicidal. For management of suicidal thoughts, see Section 7.3 Risk 
Mitigation.  
 
Site staff will assess general wellbeing (GWB) during each face-to-face visit and phone 
contact. Ratings on current demeanor and state of mind are collected on a scale of 1 
“Very Stable and Calm” to 6 “Very Distressed.” Ratings on likelihood of deterioration 
are collected from A “Does Not Face Risk” to C “Faces Risk.” Results of this scale are 
intended to maintain participant safety throughout the study. 
 
The subjective ratings of cannabis intoxication will be determined using the Drug Effect 
Questionnaire (DEQ). The individual items of the DEQ, 15 total, include ratings of drug 
effects (i.e. high, drug effect, good effect, bad effect), craving, and behavioral/mood 
states often associated with marijuana intoxication (i.e. relaxed, paranoid, hungry/have 
munchies, anxiety, irritability, feelings of heart racing/ pounding in chest). Participants 
will rate each item using a visual analog scale (VAS) anchored with “not at all” at one 
end and “extremely” at the other end. VAS measures have been reliably shown to be 
sensitive to detecting dose effects of a variety of drug classes including smoked 
marijuana. An analysis across studies assessing response to the DEQ found items to 
assess unique factors, with each item moderately to strongly related to others [98]. The 
DEQ has been used in studies assessing the effects of d-amphetamine [99] and MDMA 
[100]. This analysis also detected an association between “liking” and positive mood 
effects. 
 
Participant vital signs, including blood pressure (systolic/diastolic), heart rate and body 
temperature, will be assessed at baseline and during each weekly visit, as described in the 
Time and Events table. Vital signs will be measured before, during, and after self-
administration during introductory sessions. In addition, pulse oximetry will be assessed 
at baseline and before, during, and after introductory sessions. 
 
Urine dipstick testing will detect the alcohol metabolite Ethyl Glucuronide (EtG). EtG is 
detectable in human urine for up to 80 hours after alcohol consumption. This will be 
performed to monitor recent alcohol consumption in study participants and confirm 
participant self-reports at each face-to-face visit. 
 
The BDI-II is a 1996 revision of the BDI, a 21-item self-report measure [101, 102], that 
will serve as a screening measure for severe depression [103]. The BDI-II has been 
validated, has high internal consistency and good test/re-test reliability and is not overly 
sensitive to daily variations in mood. It takes five to ten minutes to complete [103]. Score 
cutoffs indicate: 0-13 minimal depression, 14-19 mild depression, 20-28 moderate 
depression, and 29-63 severe depression.  Subjects will complete the BDI-II at screening.  
 
The SCID-5-RV [104] is a structured clinical interview that assesses the dichotomous 
diagnoses (with indicators of severity) of psychological disorders, including substance 
use disorders. The SCID-5-RV has excellent psychometric properties and is a valid and 
reliable diagnostic tool [104]. The SCID for personality disorders (SCID-PD) will be 
used to assess for Axis 2 personality disorders. Staff will receive training on 
MAPS Study MJP-1   Amendment 5 Version 1  
US  June 28, 2016  
 
Page  23 of 76 administering these measures from a research reliable trainer. Interviews will be recorded 
in as many instances as necessary to establish reliability of a random selection of 
interviews for accuracy. These assessments will be administered at baseline by [CONTACT_150872], who will be supervised by [CONTACT_5944].  
 
The STOP-Bang Questionnaire (Chung et al., 2013) will be used as a self-report 
screening assessment for obstructive sleep apnea.  Scores on the STOP-Bang will be 
collected to inform whether study participants are at high risk for sleep-related breathing 
disorders and will be considered as a possible covariate in analysis of sleep continuity 
outcomes (e.g. Actigraphy). 
 
AEs, including spontaneously reported reactions, will be collected as described in Section 
8.0 of the protocol. Concomitant medications and therapi[INVESTIGATOR_150820] 9.0 of the protocol. 
 
5.1.3 Process Measures 
 
The Daily Diary is an instrument developed by [CONTACT_150873]. The Daily Diary will be an electronic 
data capture form completed on an electronic device. Information collected with this 
diary will include participants’ self reported quality and duration of sleep, the daily 
amount of marijuana used concomitant use of alcohol, medications, or other drugs, as 
well as AEs. Daily diary reports will be confirmed and verified by [CONTACT_89205], 
reviewing video of participants’ self-administration of marijuana, and qualitative urine 
drug testing at the sites.  
 
The LTFU questionnaire is a sponsor-developed self-report instrument that will gather 
information on current psychiatric health and wellbeing, including the occurrence of new 
traumatic events, and questions concerning the number and type of new treatments for 
PTSD the participant has undergone since his or her final visit during the treatment 
period. The LTFU questionnaire takes approximately five minutes to complete, and will 
be completed by [CONTACT_150874]-month follow-up.  
 
Laboratory testing of blood/urine cannabinoids will be conducted by [CONTACT_150875], specific and validated assay, as specified in 
Section 10.2. Peripheral blood samples will be collected and stored for biomarker 
analysis of cannabinoids (THC, 11-OH-THC, THC-COOH), CBD metabolites and 
inflammation markers with appropriately sensitive, specific and validated assays for 
CRP, IL-1β, and IL-6. Peripheral blood will be drawn at specified times in the Time and 
Events Labs table and analyzed according to procedures described in Section 10.0. 
 
Questions regarding the belief of condition assignment and certainty of the belief will be 
asked of site staff and participants at the End of Stage 1 and End of Stage 2. These beliefs 
are collected as a part of the sponsor’s ongoing initiative to optimize the double-blind as 
a part of drug development studies.

5.2.1 Pre-screening  
 
All individuals who enter pre-screening, as defined in this section, should be assigned a 
screening number and recorded on the “Screening Log”. The candidate’s screening 
number will also be noted on the signed informed consent form (ICF). Candidates who 
do not meet all eligibility criteria will not be enrolled. An IRB-approved phone screening 
script will be used to initially screen candidates. Pre-screening information will be 
retained for candidates who provide specific permission via the ICF for utilization and 
retention of this information. If candidates do not provide this permission, only the reason 
for not enrolling will be retained in study records. A Case Report Form (CRF) will not be 
completed for candidates who are not enrolled. These candidates will be documented 
only on the screening log and source records completed during screening. The site staff 
should record either the reason why an individual was not enrolled or the enrollment date 
and assigned participant number on this log. It is the responsibility of the investigator to 
file this document in the investigator site file (ISF) to be readily available for on-site 
monitoring and/or for inspection by [CONTACT_150880].   
 
5.2.2 Screen 1 
 
If pre-screening information after telephone screening with site staff and the CI or 
qualified designee suggests the candidate may be suitable for the study, site staff will 
schedule the Screen 1 visit. The Screen 1 visit consists of an in-person site visit and an IR 
visit in person or by [CONTACT_150881].  
 
a) Explain and obtain written informed consent from the candidate. Written 
informed consent must be obtained prior to performing any study-specific tests or 
evaluations.  
b) Ensure that the candidate has been issued a screening number. Complete the 
Screening Log for this visit .  
c) The candidate will provide a medical and psychological history including current 
and past medications and therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Prior to enrollment the subject should sign a 
medical release form to allow the CI to review medical records to ensure the 
participant has no underlying medical conditions and to confirm PTSD diagnosis. 
d) Review with participants of childbearing potential their ability to become 
pregnant and commitment to practice appropriate birth control as determined by 
[CONTACT_150882]. 
e) The CI or qualified designee will assess prior substance use through the TLFB 
procedure for the past three months .

DSM -5 Diagnoses – Research Version (SCID-RV) and SCID for personality 
disorders, which are module-based structured psychiatric interviews, to assess 
MAPS Study MJP-[ADDRESS_173951] the SCID interviews in as many instances as necessary. 
j) A physician, who may be the CI or qualified site staff, will perform a medical 
history directed physical examination. The examination will involve the following 
procedures:  
 Blood pressure 
 Pulse  
 Height/weight 
 Body temperature 
 Examination of head, eyes, ears, nose, throat, skin, heart, lungs, abdomen 
and extremities 
 Brief neurological exam (cranial nerves 2-12, sensory, motor, reflexes and 
cerebellar function) 
k) The following clinical assessments will be collected and reviewed by [CONTACT_150883]: 
 Electrocardiogram (ECG), the ECG will be used to establish eligibility and 
any clinically significant findings would be captured in the Medical History. 
 Serum electrolytes, metabolic profile, urinalysis and complete blood count. 
The clinical laboratory values will not be captured in the CRF, but will be 
used to establish eligibility and will be kept with the participant’s source 
record. Clinically significant findings would be captured in the Medical 
History. 
 Qualitative Urine drug screening  
 Qualitative urine-dip EtG test to assess alcohol consumption 
 Urine-dip pregnancy test in participants with childbearing potential 
 Blood cannabinoid analysis will be collected (will be sent for analysis only if 
quantitative urine analysis is inconclusive in determining abstinence) 
 Quantitative Urine drug testing (will send for analysis only if pre- and post-
cessation qualitative urine drug screens are positive for THC-COOH) 
 Pulse oximetry 
l) If, upon examination, there are questions raised about possible medical problems, 
the CIs will request a review of medical records and request additional tests or 
assessments as indicated. 
m) The site staff will discuss having participant identify a community observer who 
can be contact[CONTACT_150884]. This is a person who the participant 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_150821] a weekly basis (e.g. friend, family member, co-
worker, counselor/therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]) and who can comment on their health, behavior, and 
psychosocial engagement. The participant will provide the site staff with a 
telephone number in order to reach the community observer for the WBR.  
n) If the candidate meets all initial screening criteria, site staff will schedule the 
Screen 2 Visit.

 Blood Cannabinoid testing  
 Biomarker analyses 
d) Participants will be required to stop using non-study marijuana for a 2-week 
baseline screening period (and for the duration of the treatment period). 
Compliance will be assessed by [CONTACT_5640]: 1) Qualitatively negative urine drug 
screen, or 2) Sequential quantitative urine drug screens that indicate 90% or 
greater confidence in abstinence based on the algorithm developed by [CONTACT_150885] [77], or 3) 80% confidence in compliance based on the Huestis 
algorithm and ratios of THC to 11-OH-THC and THC-COOH in blood that 
suggest no recent use has occurred. If a participant fails the test for abstinence, 
they will be given one additional chance at the 2-week baseline abstinence period.

treatment, the CI will explain the reason for withdrawing to the participant, and refer 
them to standard clinical care for PTSD. Participants who are withdrawn will not be 
denied care within or outside of the VA or participating institutions. Participants will be 
clinically monitored after withdrawal by [CONTACT_150894]. Whenever possible, the tests and 
evaluations listed for the termination and outcome visits will be carried out. Efforts will 
be made to obtain information about AE resolutions, if applicable. All participants who 
sign informed consent , meet study eligibility criteria including 2 weeks abstinence 
period prior to randomization, and who receive initial dose of study medication will be 
included in intent to treat analyses (including data/outcome data for study participants 
who withdraw consent up to the time consent is withdrawn). 
 
Participants who discontinue treatment during the study will not be replaced. Recruitment 
and enrollment will continue until [ADDRESS_173964] completed the Primary Endpoint.  
 
5.4 Premature Discontinuation of the Study 
 
The sponsor or the CIs (following consultation with the sponsor) have the right to 
discontinue this study at any time. If the trial is prematurely terminated, the CIs are to 
promptly inform the study participants and will arrange appropriate follow-up. If the trial 
or study is prematurely discontinued, all procedures and requirements pertaining to the 
MAPS Study MJP-[ADDRESS_173965] 
 
6.1 Substance Description and Activity Related to Proposed Action 
 
The active material to be used in this protocol is dried plant material from the cannabis 
plant (marijuana). Cannabis  refers to the genus within the cannabacae  family, containing 
possibly two species c. sativa and c. indica. They are hardy annual flowering plants, and 
dioecious, meaning there are male and female plants [105]. This plant or extracts from 
this plant have been used medicinally for thousands of years, and were legal in the US 
until 1937. Marijuana was removed from the [LOCATION_002] Pharmacopeia and National 
Formulary [106]. Currently, it is a Schedule [ADDRESS_173966] three endocannabinoids and endogenous fatty acids related to arachidonic acid. 
CB1 receptors are found throughout the human brain. CBD may also contribute to the 
psychoactive profile of marijuana [65, 107, 108], and possess therapeutic potential [108, 
109]. The subjective and potentially therapeutic actions of marijuana may be directly or 
indirectly influenced by [CONTACT_150895] [108].  
 
The marijuana to be used in this study will be provided at cost by [CONTACT_133312], should the study 
receive all the required regulatory approvals. Four types of marijuana obtained through 
the NIDA Drug Supply Program that vary in ratios of THC to CBD will be used: High 
THC, High CBD, THC/CBD, or placebo. Concentrations of 7-15% will be considered 
“High” and <2% will be considered “Low,” subject to availability of marijuana grown 
and harvested by [CONTACT_133312]. Ad-libitum  self-administration will be permitted up to a 
maximum of 1.8 grams/day.  
 
The doses of marijuana (excluding placebo) were chosen because they contain a range of 
THC and CBD ratios and potencies generalizable to what many veterans are currently 
using to manage PTSD symptoms in non-clinical settings in states with legalized medical 
marijuana. The final doses and concentration to be tested are subject to availability 
through the NIDA Drug Supply Program. Prior to the study start, laboratory testing of the 
marijuana will be completed to verify chemical composition of each concentration group. 
The active doses are expected to produce all of the commonly reported subjective effects 
of marijuana. The physiological effects are expected to be tolerable based on previous 
observational studies in the literature. The placebo is expected to produce minimal side 
effects, without the range of psychological and subjective effects seen in active doses.

Page  40 of 76 6.2 Substance Concentrations, Packaging and Labeling 
 
This protocol will compare marijuana differing in THC or CBD concentrations. Any 
unused portions of the marijuana that participants did not consume during each day will 
be placed back in the daily packet and kit from which it came and collected on a weekly 
basis, with all packages labeled with day of use returned to the CI at the end of the self-
administration in Stage 1 and 2. Participants may choose to receive the amount of 
marijuana returned in Stage 1 or Stage 2 as a part of Stage 3. Any unused marijuana will 
be tracked during the study and stored for drug accountability until destruction per DEA 
recommendations. 
 
6.2.1 Doses 
 
Study participants will be assigned to receive one of four marijuana conditions based on 
cannabinoid content: ~12.40% THC/~0.03%CBD ( High THC ), ~0.53% THC/~13.94% 
CBD (High CBD ), ~7-9% THC/~7-9% CBD ( THC/CBD ) or ~0% THC/~0% CBD 
(placebo). Marijuana will be self-administered by [CONTACT_150896].  
 
Participants will be introduced to the marijuana concentration and the self-administration 
method to be used during introductory sessions during which they will smoke the study 
material. The CI or qualified designee, under the direction of  a Schedule 1 license 
holder, will supply participants with packages containing seven doses of 1.8 mg per day 
for self-administration daily during a three-week period. Any daily unused portions will 
be placed in the packaging for that day and labeled with the date of use, with all unused 
material returned to the CI or designee during each weekly evaluation during the period 
of self-administration, and at the conclusion of the three-week period of active dosing, for 
precise weighing.  The CI or designee will store each participant’s unused study drug in a 
DEA approved secured container until destruction.

6.3 Substance Accountability 
 
Forms will be provided to the site to track drug accountability and administration 
throughout the study.  Equivalent forms of the sites choosing may be used. Blinded drug 
accountability will be reviewed during routine monitoring visits. Records pertaining to 
the use of Schedule 1 compounds will be maintained in accordance with relevant Federal 
and State Regulations, and institutional policies, where applicable. Marijuana dispensed 
during the study will be tracked by [CONTACT_150901], packet number, date, and 
participant number.  
 
6.4 Substance Storage and Handling 
 
Cannabis (marijuana) is a Schedule 1 controlled substance and will be stored and handled 
in compliance with relevant institutional policies (if applicable), Federal and State 
regulations and in accordance with Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) 
requirements.

confidentiality may still happen even with these measures, another individual may be 
able to view recordings of participant marijuana use during self-administration should 
they obtain the participant’s portable tablet. If this happens, it is possible that such 
recordings could be uploaded to a computer or displayed on a social media website.  A 
breech may also happen through mishandling of participant records.  This risk is 
mitigated by [CONTACT_150902] 7.3.  
 
As with any medical procedure, there are potential risks associated with the use of 
telemedicine. In rare cases, information transmitted may not be sufficient (e.g. poor 
resolution or choppy video connection) to allow for appropriate medical decision making 
by [CONTACT_6624]. Delays in medical evaluation and treatment could occur due to deficiencies 
or failures of the equipment or internet service. Though the telemedicine system that will 
be used is HIPAA compliant and secure, in very rare instances, security protocols could 
fail, causing a breach of privacy of personal medical information.  
 
7.[ADDRESS_173969], and perception, producing increases in positive and 
negative mood states (as euphoria and anxiety), and intensifying sensory experiences, 
such as music seeming more intense [110]. Marijuana can impair attention, memory, and 
MAPS Study MJP-1  Amendment 5 Version 1  
US  June 28, 2016  
 
Page  44 of 76 visual tracking, and slow psychomotor performance. In a review of the literature, 
subjective effects were more strongly associated with marijuana than other effects [111]. 
One study found impaired visual tracking in male occasional cannabis users 
approximately an hour after administration [112]. The combination of alcohol and 
marijuana impaired simulated driving, particularly night-time driving, with regular 
cannabis users making a greater number of errors than occasional users [113], and the 
same team of researchers reported that alcohol and marijuana affected performance on a 
field sobriety test more than either substance alone [114]. Marijuana may provoke 
psychotic symptoms or psychosis in vulnerable individuals, though marijuana use alone 
is not a "cause" of psychosis [115, 116]. The literature is inconclusive, but indicates an 
association between regular marijuana use and psychosis or exacerbated psychotic 
symptoms. 
 
Regular, heavy use of marijuana is associated with impairments in cognitive function, 
especially in the area of  short-term memory and executive functioning, with impairment 
retained up to a week after abstaining from use, but no longer detectable after 28 days of 
abstinence [117-119]. Visual tracking and divided attention was impaired in heavy daily 
cannabis users compared with ecstasy-user controls [120], but tracking and attention 
improved with three weeks of abstinence from marijuana. Since marijuana interferes with 
attention, alters mood and may generate shifts in sensory attention and perception, it is 
not surprising that regular use may be taxing on cognitive task performance. The degree 
of potential impairment experienced after a month of daily use cannot be estimated from 
these findings. It is likely that if impaired cognitive function is present, it will not remain 
after prolonged abstinence [121].   
 
Marijuana use may be associated with increased occurrence of panic attacks.  A 
prospective (longitudinal) study in adolescents reported that marijuana use or dependence 
was associated with a greater likelihood of experiencing panic attacks[122], and people 
with marijuana dependence were more likely to report experiencing panic attacks [123]. 
 
Van Ours and colleagues (2013) examined the predictive value of marijuana use onset 
and monthly use upon self-reported suicidal ideation through examining data from a 
longitudinal study of a cohort born in 1972, concluding that onset of marijuana use 
preceded likelihood of reporting suicidal ideation in males, but not females [124]. The 
authors did not find that suicidal ideation preceded marijuana use, though it is notable 
that questions concerning suicidal ideation were not posed until respondents were [ADDRESS_173970] skills used in driving 
motor vehicles, driving and simulation studies fail to find strong effects of marijuana 
upon driving [125]. Researchers conducting controlled studies of people driving under 
the influence of marijuana reported that effects, while present, were relatively small and 
comparable to other medicines or alcohol [126]. This may be the result of people under 
the influence of marijuana overestimating their level of impairment, and thus driving 
more conservatively [125, 127]. Nonetheless, epi[INVESTIGATOR_150824]-[ADDRESS_173971] 
accidents [128-131], with higher levels of THC associated with greater impairment in 
driving. Elvik (2012) carried out a meta-analysis of illicit psychoactive drug use and the 
likelihood of a road traffic accident [129], reporting that cannabis was associated with 
minor, but not significantly, increased odds of traffic accidents -  lower than the rate 
associated with benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651].  Sewell and colleagues concluded that a review of the 
literature suggests a degree of inter-individual variability in degree of impairment 
experienced by [CONTACT_150903], including less impairment in experienced users 
[125].  They recommend that people not drive or use heavy machinery for up to three 
hours after marijuana use, and that people using marijuana seek a designated driver. 
Other recent analyses support Sewell and colleagues’ recommendation that people restrict 
driving for three hours after marijuana use [132, 133].  
 
Like many substances that produce increased positive mood and relaxation, marijuana 
can lead to abuse or dependence in some people, with approximately 1.6% of the general 
population  experiencing dependence upon marijuana [134]. The rate at which people 
who try marijuana become dependent is estimated as either slightly lower than or similar 
to that for alcohol, and higher than rates of dependence for hallucinogenic (psychedelic) 
compounds [135].  
 
Acutely, marijuana increases heart rate, increases supi[INVESTIGATOR_9204], and, after higher 
doses, produces orthostatic hypotension; it increases cardiac output, decreases peripheral 
vascular resistance, and dose-dependently decreases maximum exercise performance. 
Changes in cardiovascular function may occur with prolonged use. These include: 
hypotension when lying down, an increase in blood volume, slowed heart rate and 
diminished circulatory response to exercise [136].  These findings are in line with findings 
in animals of enhanced parasympathetic activity. After reviewing the literature, Jones 
(2002) concluded that the cardiovascular effects of marijuana posed little risk to young, 
healthy adults, while increased cardiac work, increased hypotension, and increased 
catecholamines might pose greater risk for older adults [136].  
 
A case report detailed an instance of a type of heart attack [ST-segment elevation 
myocardial infarction (MI)] in a 37-year old man who reported smoking marijuana prior 
to arrival at the emergency department [137], possibly as  a result of having an 
inadequate myocardial oxygen supply from smoking marijuana. Cardiac events 
associated with marijuana have been reported since 1979 [138], and a previous ST-
segment elevation MI was reported in 2010 [139]. Researchers presented a case series 
addressing marijuana use and stroke [140]. The existence and nature of the relationship 
between marijuana use and stroke remains controversial [141]. 
 
Regular and heavy marijuana use is associated with increased symptoms of chronic 
bronchitis, coughing, production of sputum, and wheezing [142, 143]. Regular marijuana 
use may impair function of alveolar macrophages, a type of immune cell found in the 
lung [143, 144]. Reduced alveolar macrophages could place individuals at increased risk 
of lung infection. One of three studies of lung function in people reporting regular, and 
often heavy, use of smoked marijuana failed to find a reduction in lung function, and 
MAPS Study MJP-1  Amendment 5 Version 1  
US  June 28, 2016  
 
Page  46 of 76 another found reduced lung function but concluded that this was related to confounding 
factors [142, 145, 146]. A review of literature addressing marijuana use and lung injury 
concluded that findings were often inconsistent [147]. Marijuana use does not appear to 
be associated with lung cancer [147-149]. Rather, the positive association between 
extended periods of marijuana use and lung cancer may be related to other confounding 
factors, such as co-occurring tobacco use. Duration of use in the studies reviewed by 
[CONTACT_150904]-week periods occurring in 
this study [149].  
 
There are several reports of cannabis-associated hyperemesis syndrome in regular 
marijuana users, marked by [CONTACT_7713], cyclical vomiting and abdominal pain that is 
relieved by [CONTACT_41680] a hot bath or shower [150-152]. 
 
The immunological effects of marijuana and cannabinoids are complex and largely 
appear to arise from effects on CB2 receptors rather than central CB1 receptors. Some of 
the benefits of marijuana, such as for multiple sclerosis, may relate in part to anti-
inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects [153, 154]. However, marijuana and 
cannabinoids failed to affect immune function in HIV-positive individuals [155, 156]. 
Regular marijuana users have greater numbers of a cannabinoid receptor implicated in 
regulating immune function, the CB2 receptor, which is generally considered to have 
immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory effects [157], and in vitro studies suggest that 
THC and marijuana may reduce immunosupportive Th1 cytokines and increase 
immunosuppressive Th2 cytokines [153, 158]. It is possible that marijuana may increase 
the risk of opportunistic infections. However, in studies of HIV-positive individuals using 
either marijuana or oral THC (as dronabinol) at similar use levels to this study failed to 
find any changes in T-cell (CD4 or CD8) profiles, findings that do not support this form 
of immunosuppression [155, 159].   
 
Participants who receive the placebo marijuana are exposed to combustion products 
without receiving either THC or CBD. They will also be less likely to experience the 
adverse effects associated with marijuana and THC described above, such as anxiety or 
impaired performance on tests of cognitive function. Participants will be permitted to 
remain on medications and therapi[INVESTIGATOR_150825]. 
 
Published reports of events associated with cannabis use include seizures upon cessation 
of use, pancreatitis, and gingival (gum) enlargement. In a report discussing the potentially 
anti-convulsant properties of cannabis, Hegde and colleagues (2012) discuss two cases 
where seizures increased in two patients after cessation of cannabis use and upon entry 
into an epi[INVESTIGATOR_150826] [160]. Two case reports describe acute pancreatitis in marijuana 
users, with one report acknowledging the difficulty of linking the previous cannabis use 
with subsequent pancreatitis [161, 162]. According to Howaizi and colleagues (2012), 
only six cases of pancreatitis associated with marijuana have been reported in the 
literature [162]. A recent case report describes gingival enlargement in two extensive 
marijuana users [163]. 
 
MAPS Study MJP-1  Amendment 5 Version 1  
US  June 28, 2016  
 
Page  47 of 76 Beyond these risks, there are only a few reports of adverse effects occurring outside the 
organs and systems listed above. There are no known effects on the liver (and only a few 
case reports of effects on the kidneys [110]).  
 
Regular use of marijuana throughout pregnancy may have effects on birth weight, as well 
as specific tasks involving visual analysis or processing. However, to date, there are no 
reports of teratological effects from marijuana use [110, 164-167]. THC can pass into 
breast milk [167]. Women of childbearing potential enrolled in this study will be required 
to use an effective method of birth control, and the study will exclude participants who 
are pregnant or lactating. 
 
Using the study drug poses a social risk of actual or perceived stigmatization. Marijuana 
use is a socially stigmatized activity [168, 169]. Participants may be ostracized or 
experience social stigma from relatives, friends or community members who view or hear 
about their smoking marijuana, or they may be aware of and internalize these prejudices 
relating to marijuana use.  
 
Participants may test positive after urinary assay for drugs of abuse, as those used for 
workplace drug testing, or as a result of police response to a traffic violation. Even 
participants who are not using their marijuana on a daily basis may test positive for 
marijuana for up to three weeks after study participation. Testing positive for marijuana 
could pose risk of arrest or job termination.

7.[ADDRESS_173972]-degree relative (parent or sibling) of psychotic disorder or 
bipolar affective disorder Type 1, cerebrovascular, cardiovascular or coronary conditions, 
and past or current substance abuse. Prior to receiving supplies of marijuana, study 
participants will be prepared for the effects of the substance during two extensive 
supervised introductory sessions described in Section 5.2.5. They will be informed of 
what to expect and they will have an opportunity to smoke the marijuana that they have 
been randomly assigned to receive in a standardized manner and in the presence of the C 
CIs. Participants will be telephoned on a daily basis for the first three days following the 
second introductory session of Stage [ADDRESS_173973] Visit CSSRS reveals current serious Suicidal Ideation (Scores of 4 or 
greater), indicating low risk, at the time of the assessment or positive Suicidal Behaviour 
(Scores of 1 or greater) then the participant will be referred appropriately for further 
management as described below.  
 
1. If the participant has current suicidal ideation, but has no specific plan to 
commit suicide (Suicidal Ideation Score = 4), the clinician administering the 
CSSRS will:  
a. Recommend the participant call the National Suicide Prevention 
Lifeline at [PHONE_080] before leaving the laboratory.   
b. Participants would be required to speak with a study clinician for 
evaluation and appropriate course of action, and encouraged to contact 
[CONTACT_150905][INVESTIGATOR_541], if they have one. 
c. Participants would be provided with a list of mental health resources.  
d. If revealed prior to enrollment, these participants may not be enrolled 
according to the Exclusion criteria based on the clinical judgment of 
the CI. 
e. If this finding is treatment-emergent, the participant may be removed 
from participation in the study based on clinical judgement of the CI or 
qualified designee. If these events emerge after enrollment and are 
clinically significant, they will be collected on the Adverse Events 
page.  The participant's continuing eligibility will be assessed by [CONTACT_150906]. 
f. Unless the steps above result in the participant leaving for psychiatric 
care right away or the clinician advises otherwise, the visit would be 
continued.  
g. If it is determined that the participant is at imminent risk of suicide, the 
CI or CI-designated staff member will do one of the following: 1)

participant to an appropriate mental health services facility (e.g. 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_120496]); or 3) call [ADDRESS_173974] has suicidal ideation, and a plan to commit suicide (Suicidal 
Ideation Score = 5), the clinician administering the CSSRS will assess 
whether the risk is imminent. A score of 5 does not necessarily indicate an 
immediate risk if the thoughts are fleeting, fairly easily controlled, and 
deterrents are strong. If there is no imminent risk, the clinician will follow the 
procedure described in number 1. If there is imminent risk of suicidal 
behavior, the CI will: 
MAPS Study MJP-1  Amendment 5 Version 1  
US  June 28, 2016  
 
Page  49 of 76 a. Call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at [PHONE_080] 
immediately. 
b. Participants would be required to speak with a study clinician for 
evaluation and appropriate course of action, and encouraged to contact 
[CONTACT_150905][INVESTIGATOR_541], if they have one, prior to leaving the 
laboratory. 
c. If it is determined that the participant is at imminent risk of suicide, the 
CI or CI-designated staff member will do one of the following: 1) 
Escort the participant to the Emergency Department; 2) Escort the 
participant to an appropriate mental health services facility (e.g. 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_120496]); or 3) call [ADDRESS_173975]’s 
safety.  
e. Provide the subject with a list of mental health resources. 
f. Notify the study team as soon as possible.  This includes all site staff 
and all study team members representing the Sponsor.  
g. If revealed during screening, these participants would not be enrolled 
according to the Exclusion criteria. 
h. If this finding is treatment-emergent, the participant may be removed 
from participation in the study based on clinical judgment of the CI or 
qualified designee. If these events emerge after enrollment and are 
clinically significant, they will be collected on the Adverse Events 
page.  The participant's continuing eligibility will be assessed by [CONTACT_150906].  
 
The CIs will address a number of risks by [CONTACT_150907], including psychotic disorders and major medical conditions affecting the 
heart or lungs. Participants who pose a major suicide risk will not be enrolled in the 
study. Risks posed by [CONTACT_150908] a period of 
abstinence from marijuana upon the start of screening. Participants using marijuana 
before entering the study are required to abstain from use for two weeks before receiving 
study marijuana. Any participant that the CI or Medical Monitor believes has 
contraindicating history of, or current, moderate to severe substance use disorder will not 
be enrolled.  
 
Untoward psychological reactions to marijuana will be dealt with by [CONTACT_150909], and through first smoking 
marijuana in the presence of site staff during two introductory sessions. During this time, 
site staff will be able to help address any anxiety or paranoid feelings that may arise.  
 
Participants will be informed of the effects that marijuana might have on driving and they 
will be advised to avoid driving immediately after use by [CONTACT_150910] a designated driver and 
MAPS Study MJP-[ADDRESS_173976] (e.g. “wallet 
card”) stating that they may test positive for drugs of abuse as a result of being a research 
participant, listing the number of a 24-hour hotline, and containing contact [CONTACT_150911], identifying the sponsor and the relevant IRB, and the study National Clinical 
Trial Registry (NCT) number. The CIs will remind participants that they may still be 
cited or face penalties for erratic driving and the card will not mitigate this.  
 
The CIs will address risks to confidentiality arising from the existence of digital video 
recordings of participant marijuana use by [CONTACT_150912].  If a study computer tablet is 
lost or stolen, the study team will remotely delete files from the device, notify local 
police in the case of theft, and make every attempt to recover the unit.  All tablets will be 
password protected and encrypted to minimize the likelihood that misplaced units will 
result in breech of confidentiality.  Given the safeguards in place, breech of 
confidentiality from the tablet computer is unlikely as long as participants follow 
instructions for use and storage.  All participant PHI will be stored in locked files or on 
secure computer servers, and managed in accordance with patient confidentiality 
procedures pertaining to electronic systems. 
 
The CIs will discuss with participants the perceived stigma they ascribe to marijuana use 
and to consider the degree to which friends, family or other people within the community 
might respond if they observe or learn about the participant’s marijuana use.  
 
This study involves take-home doses of study marijuana. To discourage the risk of 
diversion of unused marijuana during Stages 1 and 2, participants can choose to receive 
the amount of unused marijuana returned during Stage 1 or  Stage 2 in Stage 3. 
 
7.4 Medical Emergencies 
 
If a participant experiences a medical emergency during the introductory sessions, the CI 
will be on call to determine course of action. If a participant experiences a medical 
emergency during the self-administration period at a location other than the study site, he 
or she will be directed to call 911 and inform the CI upon stabilization.  
 
In the event of a psychological crisis arising during the study, participants and their 
community observers will be instructed to call the Participant Hotline as soon as possible. 
This call will be routed to the CI if it is confirmed that there is indeed a crisis. The CI, or 
MAPS Study MJP-1  Amendment 5 Version 1  
US  June 28, 2016  
 
Page  51 of 76 qualified designee if the CI is unavailable, will be on call at all times to receive 
information from the Participant Hotline.  
 
Upon learning about the psychological crisis, the CI will assess the AE by:  
 
 Obtaining a detailed history of the event over the phone 
 Collecting information on any concomitant medications 
 Verifying the above with the community observer if necessary 
 Assessing expectedness, seriousness, severity, and relation to study drug 
 All AEs will be assessed regardless of whether they occurred prior to or after self-
administration.  
 If the participant requires immediate care, they will be referred to the Emergency 
Department of the closest hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. 
 
The Mobile Crisis Response Team (if applicable), Emergency Department, Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], or 
Primary Care Provider, or the CI may prescribe medications or take steps to stabilize the 
participant experiencing an AE.  
 
While participants are participating in Stage [ADDRESS_173977] could break the study blind for a participant.  During 
any discussion with a provider about how to treat a medical event, the CIs or site staff 
may need to inform the provider of the participant's medical history and course of 
treatment in the study. The CIs or site staff should inform the provider of the likelihood 
that the participant will test positive for marijuana, and determine with the provider if the 
study blind must be broken in order to effectively treat the participant. The CIs should 
discuss delaying routine drug screens administered during treatment unless it is medically 
necessary.  
 
Regardless of condition assignment, all necessary steps will be taken to ensure 
participants receive whatever medical care is necessary for an AE.  If an outside 
treatment provider informs the participant of the results of a drug test for marijuana 
during Stage 1 of a participant's study visits, the participant must be withdrawn from the 
study in order to protect the study blind.

research study participant, including any abnormal sign (e.g. abnormal physical exam or 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease, temporally associated with the participants' 
involvement in the research, whether or not considered related to participation in the 
research. This definition includes concurrent illnesses or injuries and exacerbation of pre-
existing conditions.  
 
An unexpected AE is one that is not listed in the current Investigator’s Brochure or an 
event that is by [CONTACT_29288] a listed event.

Page  52 of 76 All AEs will be monitored by [CONTACT_150913], if the AE becomes 
chronic, a cause identified.  If an AE is unresolved at the conclusion of the protocol, a 
clinical assessment will be made by [CONTACT_150914]/or Medical Monitor as to whether 
continued follow-up of the AE is warranted. 
 
The severity of events reported on the AE CRF will be determined by [CONTACT_150915]: 
 
 Mild: no limitation in normal daily activity 
 Moderate: some limitation in normal daily activity 
 Severe: unable to perform normal daily activity 
 
The relationship of the study treatment to an AE will be determined by [CONTACT_150894], 
based on the following definitions: 
 
1. Not Related 
 
The AE is not related if exposure to the investigational product has not occurred, or the 
occurrence of the AE is not reasonably related in time, or the AE is considered unlikely 
to be related to use of the investigational product, i.e. there are no facts (evidence) or 
arguments to suggest a causal relationship, or the AE is more likely related to the 
participant’s pre-existing condition. 
 
2. Possibly Related 
 
The administration of the investigational product and the AE are considered reasonably  
related in time and the AE could be explained by [CONTACT_150916]. 
 
3. Probably Related 
 
Exposure to the investigational product and AE are reasonably related in time and the  
investigational product is more likely than other causes to be responsible for the AE, or is 
the most likely cause of the AE. 
 
The relationship of the study treatment to an AE will be determined by [CONTACT_150917]’ report of symptoms. 
 
8.[ADDRESS_173979] been compi[INVESTIGATOR_150827], are referred to as  “spontaneously 
reported reactions” are: altered time perception, anxiety, difficulty concentrating, 
difficulty remembering things, dry mouth, feeling intoxicated (as drug effect, feeling 
high), feeling of heart racing/ or pounding in chest, feeling hungry, perceptual alteration 
(as enhanced sensation), sedation and feeling stimulated [107, 171]. Some participants 
may report feelings of paranoia or unusual thoughts [65].  AEs that are included in the 
MAPS Study MJP-[ADDRESS_173980] medical occurrence that at any dose: 
 
•  Results in death 
• Is life-threatening (i.e., the participant was, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], at 
immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred); it does not refer to an event 
which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe 
• Requires or prolongs inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] 
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (i.e., the event causes a 
substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions) 
• Results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
• Requires intervention to prevent permanent impairment or damage  
• Is an important and significant medical event that may not be immediately life- 
threatening or resulting in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but based upon appropriate 
medical judgment, may jeopardize the patient/participant or may require 
intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed above 
 
AEs which do not fall into these categories are defined as non-serious.  It should be noted 
that a severe AE need not be serious in nature and that a SAE need not, by [CONTACT_108], be 
severe. 
 
In addition, a pre-existing event or condition that results in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_150828]. The hospi[INVESTIGATOR_120512] a study-related SAE unless, in the view of the investigator, 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_120513] a result of participation in the clinical trial or was 
necessary due to a worsening of the pre-existing condition.  This is because the onset of 
the event (the reason for the procedure) occurred before the participant was entered into 
the trial.  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_150829], non-emergency prophylaxis, or 
abortion does not result in an SAE report unless, in the view of the investigator, 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_150830] a result of participation in the 
clinical trial.

AEs that will be collected during the protocol: 
 
 SAEs will be collected through termination.  
 All AEs will be collected from enrollment until end of the active study period 
(e.g. end of Cessation 2 or Stage 3, as applicable) 
 Events requiring medical attention will be collected during the follow-up period 
through the participant’s last six-month follow-up. 
 Events related to planned treatments or physician visits for baseline conditions 
collected in the Medical History will not be collected unless there is an 
exacerbation of the condition. 
 Any AE leading to withdrawal from the protocol will be collected throughout the 
study. 
 All AEs related to changes in psychiatric status will be collected throughout the 
study. 
 
AEs will be collected during introductory sessions and throughout Stage 1, Stage 2, and 
Stage 3, as well as associated cessation periods, on the Daily Diary. Information needed 
to determine severity and relatedness will be collected and confirmed by [CONTACT_150918] & Events table. Each reported AE will be 
actively followed during follow-up phone calls or weekly visits until resolution. AEs will 
be recorded in the respective AE log eCRF based on onset date, e.g. an AE reported 
during Introductory Session [ADDRESS_173981] on the following working day, of the site CI learning that an event occurred, 
irrespective of causality: 
 
 Contact [CONTACT_150919] a separate document. 
 All SAEs are to be assessed regardless of whether they occurred after drug 
administration, comparator product, placebo, or no treatment.  
 SAEs will be assessed by [CONTACT_150920](s) for 
relatedness, seriousness, and unexpectedness and reported regulatory agencies, 
IRBs and CIs according to applicable regulations and policies.  
 CIs should notify their respective IRBs according to IRB-specific timelines 
promptly after assessment and communication with the sponsor.   
 SAE reporting to competent authorities is done by [CONTACT_150921]. 
 
The Medical Monitor(s) will provide the required medical expert[INVESTIGATOR_150939]-related  medical questions or problems. In this 
capacity, the Medical Monitor(s) are responsible for the overall safety of the participants, 
the ongoing safety evaluation of the investigational product and the notification of all 
concerned investigators/institutions of findings that could adversely affect the safety of 
participants. 
 
The site CIs will communicate as needed with the Medical Monitors and study monitor to 
determine if the SAE is subject to expedited reporting and what follow-up information is 
needed for evaluation. If no consensus can be reached, the different assessments and the 
reasons for this must be summarized in writing. In any case the most conservative 
assessment drives the reporting procedure. The time frames for reporting SAEs to 
regulatory authorities begins when the sponsor has “initial information” of the event 
regardless of the form that initial notification takes. Expedited timelines will be followed 
according to regulatory, institutional, and IRB requirements. 
 
The blind may be broken for an individual participant if there is an AE or other 
emergency requiring knowledge of the participant's condition assignment. This 
emergency unblinding would require approval from the site CI and Coordinating 
Investigator. For this purpose, the Randomization Monitor will provide dose assignment 
through the electronic randomization system.  
 
The Sponsor will collaborate with investigators to ensure that all reports are submitted to 
the appropriate agency and IRB/EC within the required time frame and that they contain 
accurate and current information. The sponsor is responsible for ongoing safety 
evaluation of the investigational product and for the prompt notification of investigators 
conducting a MAPS-sponsored study and regulatory authorities of findings that could 
adversely affect the safety of participants, impact the conduct of the trial, or alter the 
IRB’s approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_150831].

liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).  
 
10.3 Research Lab Biomarker Analysis 
 
Biomarker laboratory analyses will be performed using plasma for CRP, IL-1β, and IL-6 
levels collected from all participants according to the Time and Events Table. For blood 
samples, a butterfly needle will be used to draw 30mL of blood into chilled EDTA 
vacutainer tubes. Samples will be immediately placed on wet ice. Plasma will be 
extracted by [CONTACT_26795] a refrigerated (4 °C) centrifuge at 1,300g for 10 minutes, 
aliquotted into individual tubes, and stored at -80 °C prior to shipment to the 
collaborating site at University of Colorado Boulder. Biomarker analyses will be 
performed by [CONTACT_150925]. Lowry’s laboratory at the University of Colorado 
Boulder in Boulder, Colorado (collaborating site). Concentrations of CRP, IL-1β, and IL-
6 will be quantified using commercially available enzyme immunoassay kits (R&D 
Systems, Minneapolis, MN, [LOCATION_003]). These kits are highly specific and exclusively 
recognize CRP, IL-1β, and IL-6 respectively, and not related peptides. Plasma samples 
are assayed in duplicate and measured using a microplate reader for 96-well format 
according to manufacturer’s instructions. 
 
11.0 Study Monitoring, Auditing and Documentation 
 
Clinical Investigators and/or their site staff will be trained prior to the start of the protocol 
by [CONTACT_456]’s clinical research staff.  The clinical study site will be monitored by [CONTACT_150926].  The site 
will be monitored as appropriate for the rate of enrollment.  During each monitoring visit, 
source data verification will be performed by a Clinical Research Associate (CRA) to 
ensure compliance, including accurate and complete recording of data on CRFs, source 
documents, and drug accountability records. CRFs supplied by [CONTACT_150927]. Monitoring and auditing procedures of the

guidelines and to ensure validity of the study data. 
 
The sponsor will review the study documentation used for planning, conducting and  
monitoring of the study in order to ensure compliance with GCP and local regulations. 
This documentation includes, at minimum: the Investigator’s Brochure, the Study  
Protocol, the CRFs and the ICF. 
 
During or after the clinical protocol, the regulatory authorities, the IRB, and/or 
representatives of the sponsor may request access to all source documents, CRFs and 
other protocol documentation for on-site audit or inspection. 
 
12.0 Data Analysis 
 
Key Personnel, MAPS, and the biostatistician will agree on a detailed Statistical Analysis 
Plan prior to the beginning of recruitment. The biostatistician will perform an “intent to 
treat” (ITT) analysis using repeated measures analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) to 
compare demographics. Distribution of treatment dropouts will be examined by [CONTACT_150928], the sponsor will control for group assignment in the ITT 
analysis.  
 
Primary analysis of observer-blind CAPS-[ADDRESS_173987] size 
will be estimated based on all outcome measures using Cohen’s techniques. The 
biostatistician will conduct secondary exploratory analyses of weekly assessments of 
PCL-5, ISI, IDAS, IPF, WBR, CSSRS, MWC, CUDIT-R, DEQ and ACT scores using 
repeated measures ANCOVA or generalized linear mixed modeling, as described in the 
Statistical Analysis Plan. Statistical significance (p < .05) will be determined for all tests. 
All available data from repeated outcome assessments of all participants who are 
randomized, even if they withdraw from the allocated treatment prior to the primary 
endpoints, will be included in ITT analysis. 
 
A repeated measures ANCOVA comparison of ratings on the DEQ and pulse will be 
conducted, with marijuana condition as the main factor in the analysis.  If a main effect of 
marijuana concentration is observed then pairwise comparisons will be conducted to 
detect differences between each marijuana concentration. 
 
Secondary exploratory analyses will be conducted examining weekly assessments of self-
reported (via the ISI) and objective (via Actigraphy) measures of sleep. Independent 
repeated measures ANCOVAs will be conducted. In terms of self-reported sleep, weekly 
total scores from the ISI will be entered as the repeated measure with group entered as the 
IV. In terms of objective sleep (via Actigraphy) repeated measures ANCOVAs will be 
conducted with weekly total sleep time (TST), wake after sleep onset (WASO), sleep

Page  61 of 76 onset latency (SOL), and sleep efficiency (SE) entered as the repeated measure in 
independent analyses and group entered as the IV. An ITT approach will be used. 
Statistical significance will be set at p = .[ADDRESS_173988] between cannabinoid exposure and clinical response.   
 
Prognostic value of CRP, IL-1β and Il-6 will be examined using two regression analyses, 
one between biomarker values gathered at Baseline and at the primary endpoint CAPS-5 
global severity score, and another between biomarker values collected after two weeks of 
cessation and the CAPS-5 global severity score at the end of Stage 1. 
 
Qualitative safety analyses will examine Daily Diaries with summary tables listing 
maximum severity and duration, concomitant medications/therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], and AEs with 
frequencies and percentages tabulated overall and by [CONTACT_150929]. Spontaneously 
reported reactions will be separated from unexpected AEs during analysis and presented 
separately in summary tables. Statistical analyses will be conducted to evaluate safety 
and AEs by [CONTACT_150930] 
(e.g. gender, history of cannabis use, concomitant medication/drug use, baseline CAPS-5 
score). 
 
12.[ADDRESS_173989] sizes are estimated to be 0.4 (small to medium effect) for a between-
subject comparison to ensure an adequately powered study size, based on a recent meta-
analysis conducted with the National Center for PTSD [172]. Thus in the proposed study, 
N=[ADDRESS_173990] 82% power to detect these

calculations would apply for secondary analyses.  
 
MAPS Study MJP-[ADDRESS_173991] be countersigned by [CONTACT_150931].  
 
Site staff will provide a copy of the signed ICF to the participant, and will maintain the 
original in the investigator’s study file. During the study, participants will be reminded of 
upcoming study procedures at each visit to assure continued comprehension of the ICF. 
 
The written ICF and any other written information to be provided to participants should 
be revised whenever important new information becomes available that may be relevant 
to the participant's consent.  Any revised written informed consent form, and written 
information, should receive approval from an IRB before use. Written consent to take 
part in the study session includes giving the CI permission to view the participant's recent 
medical records to assess study eligibility, if needed.  Information necessary for study 
participation includes past medical history, psychiatric interview, physical examination, 
and clinical laboratory tests. 
 
The participant should be informed in a timely manner if new information becomes 
available that may affect the decision to take part in the study.  The communication of 
this information should be documented.  
 
Participants can withdraw consent for participation in the protocol at any time without 
prejudice.  If a participant withdraws consent but does not revoke the Health Insurance 
Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) authorization or equivalent form, MAPS 
will have full access to the participant’s medical records, including termination visit 
information.  If a participant revokes only the HIPAA authorization, MAPS will have full 
access to all of the participant’s medical records prior to the date and time of revocation. 
 
13.[ADDRESS_173992] information sheet, all data will be identified only by [CONTACT_2299]'s 
initials on the source document and five-digit participant number numeric code.  If past 
medical records are needed, participants will sign forms for the release of information 
upon consent to permit screening for protocol enrollment. All assessment records will be 
kept in a locked file drawer or cabinet, and access to measures will be limited to 
regulatory agencies, researchers, and individuals analyzing data.  Researchers, other than 
the CIs directly involved in the protocol, with access to data will not be provided with 
any information that would identify participants by [CONTACT_120651], such as 
social security number. Staff viewing participant video recordings of marijuana use will 
sign a confidentiality form. Files will be uploaded on a secure computer in a locked 
office, and only the date of the recording and participant number will be retained in these 
files.  
 
Maintaining data in a secure environment will prevent the accidental or deliberate 
examination or removal of data. The sponsor will utilize confidentiality 
procedures to assure participant privacy. Data to be transferred to remote servers 
will be encrypted during transfer using a Virtual Private Network. Clinical trial 
data other than video data will be hosted on Medrio, an Electronic Data Capture 
(EDC) system that is FDA-compliant.  All data entered into this system will be 
de-identified. Participants will only be referred to by [CONTACT_94202] a secondary 
identifier code. Source Records and identifying information will be retained at 
clinical sites per GCP. The sponsor will train the study staff on EDC procedures. 
Each study staff member with access to the data will be given an individual 
password.  
 
The sponsor has developed a feature that will allow participants to create a password and 
enter their self-report questionnaire data directly into Medrio using the ePRO feature. 
Participants will be reminded by [CONTACT_150932]. Participant emails will be treated 
as Protected Health Information (PHI) in the database. Participants will receive a 
welcome email and reminder emails to ensure that they provide all necessary data.  
 
Subjects will be showed how to securely use their tablet computers.  This will include 
instruction on password protection, ePRO and video uploads to ensure security. After the 
upload is confirmed as complete at the site, the original video on the handheld device will 
be deleted by [CONTACT_6624]. All identifying information and study related information will be 
stored in locked files, encrypted drives, or secure servers.  If a tablet is lost or stolen, 
local police will be notified and every effort made to recover the device.  Participants will 
be instructed to store their tablet computers in their study supplied lock box.   
 
13.2 Costs to Participants and Compensation 
 
The Sponsor of this study will cover the costs that are directly related to this study. This 
includes the costs for introductory sessions, for the psychological and laboratory testing, 
for medical examinations, the portable tablet with video and lockable storage box, and 
MAPS Study MJP-1  Amendment 5 Version 1

Page  64 of 76 the study drug. Neither the participant nor their medical insurance (if any) will be 
charged for any procedures done solely for the purpose of the study. The subject will not 
be charged for lost or damaged tablet computers. 
 
Charges for treatment of the participant’s condition that are unrelated to the research 
study, or any of its procedures, will continue to be billed to the health insurance provider 
of the participant or to the participant him or herself.  It is anticipated that there will not 
be any charges for treatment that is unrelated to the study. 
 
Participants will be compensated for their time and effort, up to $400 for completion of 
Stage 1 and Stage 2 and $50 for completion of the long-term follow-up visit. 
Compensation will be pro-rated for visits and tasks as they are completed. Compensation 
of this magnitude is appropriate given the length and nature of this study.

study involves self-administration of a study drug. Participants will be directed to go to 
the nearest emergency department if they experience a medical emergency, and the 
sponsor will provide compensation for study-related medical treatment costs. 
 
14.[ADDRESS_173995] consult a MAPS representative before disposal of 
any study records.  “Essential documents” are defined as documents that individually and 
collectively permit evaluation of the conduct of a trial and the quality of the data 
produced.  It is the responsibility of the sponsor to inform the CI/institution as to when 
these documents no longer need to be retained. CIs must retain all study records required 
MAPS Study MJP-[ADDRESS_173996] results, all study data, 
and access to all study records.  
 
Any results of medical investigations with the sponsor products and/or 
publication/lecture/manuscripts based thereon, shall be exchanged and discussed by [CONTACT_150934](s) prior to submission for 
publication or presentation.  Due regard shall be given to the sponsor's legitimate 
interests, e.g. manuscript authorship, obtaining optimal patient protection, coordinating 
and maintaining submissions to health authorities, and coordinating with other ongoing 
studies in the same field.  
 
The full details of the processes of producing and reviewing reports, manuscripts, and 
presentations based on the data from this trial will be described in the Clinical Trial 
Agreement.

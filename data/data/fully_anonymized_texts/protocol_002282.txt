investigation, subjects are targeted who are habitual contact [CONTACT_19554]. To be eligible to participate, subjects must have physiologically normal anterior segments not exhibiting clinically significant biomicroscopy findings, no active ocular disease or allergic conjunctivitis, not using any topi[INVESTIGATOR_145901].   
3.2.1 Eligibility  
[IP_ADDRESS] Inclusion Criteria 
To be eligible for entry into the study, the subject must:  
1. Be 18 years or older on the date the Informed Consent Form (ICF) is signed and have capacity to read, understand and provide written voluntary informed consent.   

ROC2 -21-[ADDRESS_167205] signed a statement of informed consent.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Exclusion Criteria The subject i s not eligible to participate in the study if the subject is:  
1. Participating in a conflicting study. 
2. Considered by [CONTACT_145912] a suitable candidate for participation.  
 
3.2.[ADDRESS_167206] and investi gator will be masked. An unmasked designee will be responsible 
for dispensing study products to the subjects according to the randomization schedule. The randomization schedule will be produced prior to study enrollment by [CONTACT_59268] + Lomb’s unmasked statistician not otherwise involved in the study.  Randomization will be completed by [CONTACT_145913]. The subjects will be assigned randomization numbers sequentially as they are enrolled. The unmasked designee is responsible for preparing the clinical trial materials according to the randomization schedule. The unmasked designee is also responsible for maintaining study lens inventory, randomization schedule and the Product Accountability Log in a masked fashion. 
 
3.2.[ADDRESS_167207] completed the study when he/she has worn the study lenses. 
 Subjects who require further follow-up due to an ongoing Adverse Event will be followed according to the Adverse Event S ection  6.0. 
 The Investigator may discontinue a subject during the study for any reason if, in his or her opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], it is in the best interest of the subject. Reasons for discontinuation include but are not limited to: 
 
• adverse effects   
• other ocular complications  
• subject non-compliance  
• subject request   
• subject found to be ineligible during study participation*   
*Any subject enrolled in the study, who later is found to have not met any of the eligibility criteria at entry, will be discontinued at the Sponsor’s request. 
 
  
Subject discontinuations will be documented clearly on the applicable case report form.   
Subjects that are discontinued from the study following randomization will not be replaced.  
 Exit visits should be completed for early terminated subjects.
 
 
The completion of the clinical investigation shall be deemed to coincide with the last visit of the

document. The assessments required for the study are routinely performed and are standard of care for contact [CONTACT_19554]. The subjects will be informed of any  potential study specific risks 
in the ICF or if new risks become apparent during the study. 
 
4.9.[ADDRESS_167209] lens wear there may be increased risk of corneal edema (swelling of the cornea) 
which may temporarily affect vision or comfort, neovascularization (small blood vessels growing into the cornea), giant papi[INVESTIGATOR_145902] (small bumps on the inside of the eyelids), iritis (internal inflammation in the eye), corneal infiltrates (corneal inflammation) and corneal erosion/abrasion or corneal infection, which if untreated may cause ocular problems.  The risks involved in this study will be minimized because the subjects will be examined frequently and at specified intervals.  The risks are further minimized by [CONTACT_145914].     
 The subject may not personally benefit from being in this study other than getting the opportunity to wear different types of contact [CONTACT_13276].  However, study results may allow a new or improved product to be marketed in the future giving benefit to other contact [CONTACT_145915].  
4.9.2 Risk Related to Data Management The risks involved in this study related to data management will be minimized because the CRT (Clinical Research Technician) will enter the data directly into the Electronic Data Capture (EDC) system. The Primary Investigator or Delegate will visually verify the data as it is entered, except masked information when applicable.  If data is not entered directly into the EDC System, the data will be double entered.  Then, the two sets of data will be compared to each other and then checked for discrepancies.  
  Risk of data management is further minimized by [CONTACT_145916].  For example, the EDC system does not allow the same lens to be dispensed more than once. Also, the expected ranges of values are specified in the EDC system. If data falls outside of the expected range, the CRT will be prompted to answer a query.  
 
4.10 Relevance of Clinical Investigation 
Bausch + Lomb is finalizing the kalifilcon A toric lens design. This this clinical study aims to 
confirm whether the kalifilcon A daily disposable toric contact [CONTACT_145917]. 
 
Further information regarding the relevance of this study in the context of state of the art clinical practice such as background information, summary of relevant literature, mechanism of action, 
intended clinical performance, and a summary of existing relevant clinical data of the 
investigational device can be found in the Investigator’s Brochure.

5.[ADDRESS_167212] adhere to the requirements of the governing IRB/EC.   Any subject enrolled in the study who later is found to have not met the eligibility criteria  
at entry will be discontinued. Otherwise, unless the protocol deviations put the subject at risk or the subject’s condition requires that they be discontinued from the study, subjects may continue to participate until the end of the study.  6.0 ADVERSE EVENTS   
Subjects who experi ence an Adverse Event (AE) during study participation will be  discontinued 
from study participation but will be followed by [CONTACT_145919].  
 
 
6.1 Adverse Event Definitions  
For the purposes of this study, reportable AEs include ocular AEs and non-ocular serious 
adverse events (SAEs). All AEs will be classified first for seriousness and significance and  
then as to whether or not they are device related or non -device related and if device related,  
then, if it is an adverse device effect (ADE), an anticipated serious adverse device effect  
(ASADEs) or an unanticipated serious adverse device effect ([LOCATION_003]DEs). AEs, ADEs,  
ASADEs, [LOCATION_003]DEs , SAEs, Significant Non -Serious AEs and Non- Signi ficant  Non - 
Serious AEs are defined as follows:  
 
6.1.1 Adverse Event (AE)  
Any untoward medical occurrence, unintended disease or injury, or untoward clinical signs 
(including abnormal laboratory findings ) in subjects or users , whether or not related to the 
investigational medical device.  Adverse events should be categorized as device related or non -
device related.  
Throughout the course of this study all efforts will be made to remain alert to reportable AEs.  If an AE occurs, the first concern will be the safety of the subject and appropriate 
medical intervention will be made.  
All reportable AEs occurring after signing of informed consent and through the subject’s end of participation in the study must be reported. All reportable AEs must be followed until the event resolves or stabilizes.

• Allergic Conjunctivitis  
• Corneal Edema  
• Contact [CONTACT_145920]  
 
6.1.[ADDRESS_167216] (ADE)  
An ADE is an Adverse Event that is assessed to be related to the use of an investigational 
medical device. This definition includes Adverse Events resulting from insufficient or inadequate instructio ns for use; deployment, implantation, installation, or operation; or any malfunction of 
the investigational medical device. This definition also includes any event resulting from use error or from intentional misuse of the investigational medical device.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Anticipated Serious Adverse Device Effect (ASADE)  
An ASADE is an ADE that first meets the serious criteria (see definition above for Serious 
Adverse Event) or significant, non-serious criteria (see above definition for significant, non-serious AE) and which, by [CONTACT_5942], incidence, severity or outcome, has been previously identified in the investigational plan or application (including a supplementary plan or application) and/or in the risk analysis report. ASADEs include:  
• Corneal Ulcer (infectio us or non-infectious) 
• Keratitis  
• Sensitivity to light (photophobia) 
• Excessive eye secretions including mucopurulent discharge 
• Blurred vision, rainbows or halos around objects 
• Poor visual acuity (reduced sharpness of vision)

 Page 21 of 43 [IP_ADDRESS] Unanticipated Serious Adverse Device Effect ([LOCATION_003]DE)  
An [LOCATION_003]DE is an ADE that first meets the serious criteria (see definition above for Serious 
Adverse Event) or significant, non- serious criteria (see above definition for significant, non-
serious AE) and has an effect on health or safety or any life-threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with, a device if that effect, problem or death was not previously identified in nature, severity or degree of incidence in the investigational plan or application (including a supplementary plan or application), or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects.  
 
6.1.[ADDRESS_167218] of care.  
 A culture should be obtained in cases of corneal ulcer or suspected ocular infection, unless medically contraindicated. Cultures should be taken from the cul- de-sac, lower eyelid margin, 
and the corneal lesion (if applicable). When a culture is obtained, t he contact [CONTACT_145922] (if available at the time of the  culture) for culturing and processing by [CONTACT_145923] e Research Clinic. Microbial data generated from returned 
subject supplies (e.g., lenses, lens cases and/or lens case solutions) are for information only. Because microbes may be introduced into subject supplies during use, recovery of microbes from return ed subject supplies cannot be presumed to indicate etiology or direction of organism 
transmission. The ocular cultures, along with the associated contact [CONTACT_145924], will be sent to the clinical laboratory designated by [CONTACT_145925]. The clinical laboratory will report the culture results to both the Investigator and to the Research Clinic, the Investigator will record the results in the CRF.
 
 
6.3 Adverse Event Identification and Evaluation  Throughout the course of a study all efforts will be made to remain alert to Adverse Events  
(AEs). If an AE occurs, the first concern will be the safety of the subject and appropriate medical intervention will be made. The associated product should be retained for further analysis, if needed.  
 All AEs occurring after signing the informed consent and through the end of the subject’s participation in the study must be recorded and reported, if applicable. All AEs must be followed until the event resolves or stabilizes.  
 
Identify potential adverse events during a clinical study by [CONTACT_145926]: 
• Direct observation by [CONTACT_145927]2 -21-[ADDRESS_167219] Lenses   
 
 
 
Version 1.0                                                CONFIDENTIAL                   October  8, 2021  
 Page 22 of 43 • Asking the study participant using a non-specific question (i.e. Have you had any 
problems since the last visit?)  
• Unsolicited volunteering of information by [CONTACT_87755] (i.e. Doctor, I have had 
numerous headaches since I started using this lens) 
• Laboratory or test results that meet protocol requirements for classification as an adverse event (i.e. IOP over 30mmHg) 
When evaluating AEs, the Investigator should classify the AE based on the following three criteria:  
 
1. Seriousness and/or significance  (based on the criteria provided in Section 6.1)  
 
Severity:  
• Mild:  Subject awareness of a sign or symptom that is easily tolerated, requires no 
treatment, and does not interfere with subject’s daily activities.  
 • Moderate:  Subject awareness of a sign or symptom which may be a low level of 
concern to the subject and may interfere with daily activities but can be relieved by [CONTACT_119106].  
 • Severe:  A sign or symptom that interrupts the subject’s daily activity and requires 
systemic therapy or other treatment.  
 
2. The relationship of the event to the study device  using the following guidelines   
• Related: There is at least a reasonable possibility that the AE is related to the study device (contact [CONTACT_13293]) and/or solution or rewetting drops. Reasonable possibility means that there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship or association between the study device and/or solution or rewetting drops and the AE. Also referred to as an ADE.  
• Not Related: There is little or no reasonable possibility that the AE is related to the study device (contact [CONTACT_13293]) and/or solution or rewetting drops. This assessment implies that the AE has no evidence to suggest either a causal relationship or association to the study device and/or solution or rewetting drops and a more likely or certain alternative etiology exists.  
3. Expectedness of  the event  
• Unexpected Adverse Event (UAE) :  Unexpected Adverse Events must be reported to 
the IRB within 10 calendar days of discovery. 
 
• Expected Adverse Event : An adverse event of which, the nature or severity of which is 
consistent with the current product labeling, investigator brochure, data sheet, etc. 
6.4 Adverse Event Collection and Reporting  
The Research Clinic will delegate each function’s roles and responsibilities related to adverse event reporting. The Director of Clinical Affairs is respon sible for ensuring that all Research 
Clinic Staff understand their responsibilities for collecting and assessing adverse event

 Page 23 of 43 information and forwarding applicable adverse event information to the appropriate business 
function.  Research Clinic Staff are responsible for understanding the procedures for adverse event collection, evaluation, documentation, and reporting. 
• Collect and record information about any identified adverse event (including the date of the adverse event, treatment, resolution, assessment of both the seriousness and the relationship to the investigational device and the related procedure) on the Adver se Event 
form. The Adverse Event Form will be completed each time the subject is seen during the management of the incident and at resolution of the incident.  
• If an adverse event is determined to be serious or significant and non-serious, notify the 
Princ ipal Investigator immediately.  
• Report all serious or significant and non-serious adverse events within twenty- four (24) 
hours to Regulatory Affairs, Global Product Surveillance and/or Global Safety 
Surveillance and Pharmacovigilance as appropriate for the product being evaluated. Continue to send follow-up information or provide support to the appropriate reporting business function for any serious adverse event as soon as it becomes available. 
o Ensure that the subject’s identity is protected and the subject ’s identifiers in the 
study are properly documented on the form.   
• Report all unexpected adverse device effects to the reviewing Institutional Review Board within 10 business days of discovery.  Continue to send follow-up information as soon as it becomes available.  
• Report any adverse event resulting from Intentional Misuse of an investigational medical device per the same procedures as above.  
• Report any adverse event resulting from a Device Deficiency per the same procedures as above. All Device Deficiencies should be recorded and evaluated for the potential to cause a serious adverse event.   
• All appropriate measures will be taken to ensure the safety of the subject. Follow the subject until th e adverse event resolves or until an appropriate endpoint is reached. This 
may imply that follow -up will continue after the subject has left the study.  
• A treatment of an AE will depend on the severity of the adverse event. The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_145904] a suitably licensed eye  care professional for 
immediate treatment if necessary.  
• Expenses incurred for study- related medical treatment will be paid by [CONTACT_59268] + Lomb. 
Research Clinic Staff will contact [CONTACT_145928].  
• If it is determined , based on evaluation of any serious adverse event or serious adverse 
event trending, that the study presents an unreasonable risk, the Research Clinic may choose to terminate the study. Refer to the Study Termination procedures (section 5.2.2) for additional information and relevant periods for terminating a study.  
• All adverse events will be documented in the final study report. Adverse Event documentation must be saved in the Trial Master File and in the respective study folder in the electronic repository.

8.1.[ADDRESS_167224] Entry with Verification or Double Data Entry.   
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Direct Entry with Verification  
Direct Entry with Verification is the preferred method for entering study data. Data is collected by [CONTACT_145929].  A second person, typi[INVESTIGATOR_145905] (or Delegate), will visually verify the data as it is entered, except masked information when applicable. 
• In the event that the EDC System is unavailable, a paper CRF will be used to collect study data for later entry into the EDC System. After each page of the CRF is entered into the EDC System, the CRT or Delegate will initial the CRF to indicate the data has been entered into the EDC System and visually verified.  
• Randomization Verification is required at the conclusion of each study prior to data distribution. The CRT or Delegate will verify each dispensed article against the study randomization and Clinical Trial Material (CTM) label, if applicable. After Randomization Verification of dispensed article, the CRT or Delegate will mark the Verification checkbox in the EDC System to acknowledge completion of dispensed article verification.  
• If discrepancies arise during the verification of a paper source, the CRT or Delegate assesses the discrepancy and obtains additional information t o determine if the correct 
entry was made or corrects paper source as appropriate. The CRT or Delegate may consult the Primary Investigator if necessary.  
• The data is extracted from the EDC System and checked for accuracy by [CONTACT_145930]. The data extract is checked to confirm the lens reformat codes match the lens key. Calculations performed by [CONTACT_145931].  
• Database Randomization Verification is performed, if appli cable, prior to data 
distribution.  
  
[IP_ADDRESS] Double Entry of Data  
If data is not entered directly in the EDC system, the data will be double entered (entered twice)  
and the two sets of data will be compared to each other and then checked for discrepancies .  
 When a paper source (i.e. subject questionnaire) is used to collect study data, this method may be used.  For example, a subject questionnaire will be entered into two different spreadsheets.  The two spreadsheets are then compared to each other. 
• If discrepancies arise during the verification of a paper source, the CRT or Delegate assesses the discrepancy and obtains additional information to determine if the correct entry was made or corrects the paper source as appropriate. The CRT or Delegate may consult the Primary Investigator if necessary.

you should immediately remove lenses and promptly contact [CONTACT_89635]. 
 
PRECAUTIONS : 
You should be aware of and fully discuss with your eye care professional the following safety precautions: 
 Lens Handling  Precautions  
• Always wash and rinse hands before handling lenses. Do not get cosmetics, lotions, soaps, 
creams, deodorants, or sprays in the eyes or on the lenses. It is best to put on lenses before putting on makeup. Water- base cosmetics are less likely to damage lenses than oil -base 
products. 
• Be certain that the fingers or hands are free of foreign materials before touching your 
lenses, as microscopic scratches of the lenses may occur, causing distorted vision and/or injury to the eye. 
• Always handle your lenses carefully and avoid droppi[INVESTIGATOR_35459]. 
• Do not touch the lens with your fingernails. 
• Carefully follow the handling, insertion, removal, storing and wearing instructions in these subject instructions and those prescribed by [CONTACT_1704]. 
• Never use tweezers or other tools to remove your lenses from the lens container unless specifically indicated for that use. Pour the lens into the hand. 
 Lens Wearing Precautions  
• Never wear your lenses beyond the period recommended by [CONTACT_89635]. 
• If the lens sticks (stops moving) on the eye, follow the recommended directions on Care for a Sticking (Nonmoving) Lens. The lens should move freely on the eye for the continued health of the eye. If nonmovement of the lens continues, you should immediately consult your eye care professional.  
• Avoid, if possible, all harmful or irritating vapors and fumes when wearing lenses. 
• If aerosol products are used while wearing lenses, exercise caution and keep eyes closed until the spray has settled.  
 Topi[INVESTIGATOR_145909]:  
• You should not wear contact [CONTACT_145939]. Exposure to water while wearing contact [CONTACT_145940], water skiing and hot tubs may increase the risk of ocular infection including but not limited to Acanthamoeba kerati tis. 
• Always contact [CONTACT_145941].  
 
Who should know that you are wearing contact [CONTACT_13276]?  
• You may decide to inform your health care professional about being a contact [CONTACT_35560].

ADVERSE REACTIONS (PROBLEMS AND WHAT TO DO) : 
You should be aware that the following problems may occur: 
• Eyes stinging, burning, itching (irritation), or other eye pain  
• Comfort is less than when lens was first placed on eye  
• Abnormal feeling of something in the eye (foreign body, scratched area)  
• Excessive watering (tearing) of the eyes  
• Unusual eye secretions  
• Redness of the eyes  
• Reduced sharpness of vision (poor visual acuity)  
• Blurred vision, rainbows, or halos around objects 
• Sensitivity to light (photophobia) 
• Dry eyes  
 
If you notice any of the above, you should: Immediately remove your lenses  
• If the discomfort or problem stops, then look closely at the lens. If the lens is in any way damaged, do not put the lens back on your eye. You should remove the lens and place it in the provided contact [CONTACT_145942]. Then insert a new lens on the eye.  If the problem 
continues, you should immediately remove the lenses and consult your eye care professional . 
 When any of the above problems occur, a serious condition such as infection, corneal ulcer, neovascularization, or iritis may be present. You should keep the lens off your eye and seek immediate professional identification of the problem and prompt treatment to avoid serious eye damage.  
 
PERSONAL CLEANLINESS AND LENS HANDLING : 
1. Preparing the Lens for Wearing:  
It is essential that you learn and use good hygienic methods in the care and handling of your new lenses. Cleanliness is the first and most important aspect of proper contact [CONTACT_145943]2 -21-[ADDRESS_167235] Lenses

 Page 41 of 43 care. In particular, your hands should be clean and free of any foreign subs tances when 
you handle your lenses. The procedures are: 
• Always wash your hands thoroughly with a mild soap, rinse completely, and dry 
with a lint-free towel before touching your lenses. 
• Avoid the use of soaps containing cold cream, lotion, or oily cosmetics before 
handling your lenses, since these substances may come into contact [CONTACT_145944].  
• Handle your lenses with your fingertips and be careful to avoid contact [CONTACT_145945]. It is helpful to keep your fingernails short and smooth. 
• Start off correctly by [CONTACT_145946].  
 
2. Handling the Lenses:  
• Develop the habit of always working with the same lens first to avoid mix -ups. 
• Position the lens on your index finger and  examine it to be sure that it is moist, 
clean, clear, and free of any nicks or tears.  
• Should you accidentally place an inside -out lens on your eye, one of the following 
signs should signal you to remove and replac e it correctly.  
a) Less than usual comfort, 
b) The lens may fold on the eye, 
c) Excessive lens movement on blink, 
d) Blurred vision. 
• If the lens folds and sticks together: Place the lens in the palm of your hand and wet thoroughly with the recommended rinsing or storing solution. Then GENTLY rub the lens between your index finger and palm in a gentle back and forth motion. 
• If the lens flattens or drapes across your finger, the lens or your finger may be too wet. To correct this, dry your finger by [CONTACT_145947], drying the opposite finger each time. 
 
3. Placing the Lens on the Eye  
There are other methods of lens placement. If the following methods are difficult for you, your Study Doctor will provide you with an alternate method.  
 
NOTE: If after placement of the lens, your vision is blurred, check for the following:  The lens is not centered on the eye (see “Centering the Lens,” next in these instructions).  
If the lens is centered, remove the lens (see “Removing the Lens” section) and check for 
the following:  
• Cosmetics or oils on the lens (replace the lens)  
• The lens  is on the wrong eye  
• The lens is inside-out (it would also not be as comfortable as normal)

 Page 42 of 43 If you find that your vision is still blurred after checking the above possibilities, remove 
both lenses and consult your eye care professional .  
 
A. The One -Hand Placement Technique  
• Place the lens on your index finger. Head up, looking straight ahead, pull down your 
lower eyelid with the middle finger of your placement hand. Look up steadily at a point 
above you. Then place the lens on the lower white part of your eye. Remove your index 
finger and slowly release the lower lid. Look down to position the lens properly. Close your eyes for a moment; the lens will center itself on your eye.  
 
B. The Two -Hand Placement Technique  
• With the lens on your index finger, use the middle finger of the other hand to pull the 
upper lid against the brow. Use the middle finger of your placement hand to pull down 
the lower lid and then place the lens centrally on your eye. While holding this position, look downward to position the lens properly. Slowly release your eyelids.  
• If the lens feels uncomfortable, then look in the mirror and gently place a finger on the edge of the contact [CONTACT_145948]. Then by [CONTACT_145949], the lens will re- center itself. If the lens still feels 
uncomfortable, follow the steps described in the section of these instructions entitled “Adverse Reactions.”  
 
4. Centering the Lens  

ROC2 -21-[ADDRESS_167237] techniques are not performed properly. To center a lens, follow one of the procedures below.  
• Hold the upper and lower eyelids open with your fingers. Then while looking in a 
mirror, gently place a finger on the contact [CONTACT_145950].  
OR 
• Hold the upper and lower eyelids open with your fingers. Then, while looking in a 
mirror, move your eye towards the lens to place it on the center of the eye.  
 
5. Removing the Lens  
• Always remove the same lens first.  
• Wash, rinse, and dry your hands thoroughly.  
• Always be sure that the lens is in the correct position on your eye before you try to 
remove it (a simple check of your vision, closing one eye at a time, will tell you if the lens is in the correct position). Look up and slowly pull down your lower eyelid with the middle finger of your removal hand and place your index finger on the lower edge of lens. Squeeze the lens lightly between the thumb and the index finger and remove it. Avoid sticking the edges of the lens together. 
• Remove the other lens by [CONTACT_145951]. 
• Follow the required lens care pr ocedures described by [CONTACT_89635]. 
• NOTE: If this method of removing your lens is difficult for you, your eye care 
professional will provide you with an alternate method. 
 
6. Return of Your Study Lenses  
At each visit, you must return all worn and unworn lenses  that were dispensed to you 
during the designated wear periods.  
 
7. Emergency: If chemicals of any kind (household products, gardening solutions, laboratory chemicals, 
etc.) are splashed into your eyes, you should: FLUSH EYES IMMEDIATELY WITH TAP WATER AND THEN REMOVE LENSES PROMPTLY. CONTACT [CONTACT_145952] A HOSPI[INVESTIGATOR_35466].

  Page 3 of 22 1  Introduction/Significance  
Common upper extremity injuries often need to heal with no wrist and forearm range of 
motion. Forearm range of motion includes supi[INVESTIGATOR_4822]. Injuries that 
necessitate limiting forearm range of motion include fracture patterns involving the dist al 
radioulnar joint (DRUJ), proximal radioulnar joint (PRUJ), triangular fibrocartilage 
complex (TFCC), both bone forearm fractures, ulnar shortening procedures, radial and 
ulnar osteotomies, DRUJ instability (Slaughter, Miles, Fleming & McPhail, 2010; 
LaStayo & Lee, 1996).  Long arm orthoses, sugar tong orthoses and muenster style 
orthoses can all limit forearm rotation.   
Past research has indicated common methods of immobilization to include the following: 
sugar tongs cast/orthosis, muenster cast/orthosi s, long arm cast/orthosis/or short arm 
cast/orthosis, an d an antirotation orthosis.  A long arm cast/orthosis is excellent at 
limiting forearm rotation, yet it does not allow any elbow flexion and extension  (Kim, 
Kook & Kim, 2012) . In the study by  [CONTACT_455781], Koo k, & Kim (2012)  the authors  found that the 
sugar tong orthotic was as effective and limiting forearm rotation as the long arm 
orthotic.  The sugar -tong can decrease forearm rotation to 30% of their normal values 
(Kim, Kook, & Kim 2012; Gil, DeFroda, & Hsu,  2016).  A sugar tong  limits rotation based 
on the circumferential fit, but can be difficult to don and doff.   
The modified antirotation orthosis allows for elbow and wrist flexion and extension, yet it 
mainly limits pronation through proprioceptive input around 30 degrees and does not 
prevent rotation  (Monsterio & Brou, 2007; Sla ughter, Miles, Fleming, & McPha il, 2010) .  
This type of orthosis can be helpful in non -surgical approach to limiting forearm rotation 
(Monsterio & Brou, 2007).  
Lawton, Nicolls, an d Charoglu (2007) compared a long arm cast thumb spi[INVESTIGATOR_704133] a 
muenster thumb spi[INVESTIGATOR_704134].  Results concluded that the muenster thumb spi[INVESTIGATOR_704135]; however, the muenster 
group maintained a 52 deg ree arc of elbow motion. In a small study done by [CONTACT_704149] t (2012)  a long arm cast allowed an [ADDRESS_956581] or orthosis that immobilizes the elbow is required 
(Troccia & Hammert, 2012). Often though it is beneficial to allow elbow motion to 
prevent unnecessary elbow joint stiffness, and a muenster cast  or orthosis is required.  
A muenster style or thosis is designed to limit forearm rotation at the distal radioulnar 
joint (DRUJ) yet allowing elbow flexion and extension after an injury that necessitates 
limiting forearm rotation (Slaughter, Miles, Fleming & McPhail, 2010 ).  Muenster 
orthoses can be r adial based or ulnar based.  A radial based muenster is another 
options and can reduce the pressure off the olecranon, yet it is difficult for a therapi[INVESTIGATOR_704136]. In the study by [CONTACT_704150], Miles, Fleming and McPhail (2010), a radial based 
muenster w as fabricated. This orthosis was compared with a sugar tongs orthosis, anti -
DRUJ rotation orthosis, and a custom wrist orthosis.  The muenster and sugar tongs 
 
 
  Page [ADDRESS_956582] .  Limiting factors include measuring 
motion with a hand held goniometers.  A research study by [CONTACT_455781], Kook, and Kim (2012) 
limited measurement error by [CONTACT_40397] a custom -made goniometer device that placed all 
subjects in the same position.  
Currently , there  are no research studies that compare the amount of forearm rotation in 
a traditional thermoplastic orthoses to newer materials such as a Delta Cast orthosis, or 
prefabricated muenster orthoses  such as the Hely and Weber MTC Fracture Brace .   
The purpose of this study is to assess which orthosis -a traditional thermoplastic ulnar 
based muenster, a delta cast style muenster and the Hely and Weber MTC Fracture 
Brace -allows for the least amount of supi[INVESTIGATOR_704137] a healthy population  in 
the dominant extremity.  
Study Objectives   
 
Primary Objective  
To assess which orthosis -a traditional thermoplastic ulnar based muenster, a delta cast 
style muenster and the Hely and Weber MTC Fracture Brace - allows for the least 
forearm rotation (Supi [INVESTIGATOR_20810]/Pronation)  in a healthy population  in the dominant 
extremity .  
 
Secondary Objective:    
To assess through a questionnaire barriers of wearing an orthosis that limits forearm 
rotation such as the comfort of the fit, the weight of the orthosis, the ease of 
donning/doffing, does the orthosis cause pain, and the aesthetics of the orthosis.   
2 Patients and Methods  
2.1 Study Design  
2.1.1  Gene ral Design  
 
(B) Experimental Design   
Definition :  In this study, the same subjects (30 ) will have [ADDRESS_956583].  
 
Photo below is similar to what will be manufactured for the study:  
 
2.1.3  Secondary Outcome Variables  
The Orthoti cs and Prosthetics User’s Survey (OPUS) is a  well validated, self-report 
questionnaire consisting of five modules.  Therapy will use 5 questions from the OPUS: 
Satisfaction with Device and Services Module.   These five questions are scored on a 5 -point 
likert scale from Strongly Agree to Strongly Disagree with a 6th option of “don’t know”.    
 
The five questions include - 
 1). My orthosis fits well.  
 2). The weight of my orthosis is manageable.  
 3). It is easy to put on my orthosis.  
 4). My  orthosis is pain free to wear.  
 5). My orthosis looks good.  
 

 
 
  Page 6 of 22 The remaining 16 questions were excluded as it did not pertain to healthy volunteers wearing the 
orthosis only during his/her research participation.

elbow injuries on the dominant side of his/her body, time of [ADDRESS_956585] or elbow injuries on the  
dominant side of his/her body.  Examples include distal radius injuries with 
intraarticular involvement, ulna fractures with intraarticular involvement, ulnar sided 
wrist pain, known TFCC injuries, Elbow fractures that limited the PRUJ in forearm 
rotation .  Subjects with known rheumatoid arthritis deformities of the wrist or any 
prior wrist surgeries are excluded.  
2.3 Study Procedures  
Subjects will be recruited from using an email sent to employees in the hand clinic, 
the PM&R fellowship, and PM&R residency, and Physical Therapy School for 
recruitment . Word of mouth will also be utilized to recruit subjects.   Subjects will be 
screened to see if they have met the inclusion criteria.   
 
Consent processes will be initiated if the subject has met the inclusion cr iteria.  
 
The data collection sheet will collect gender, age, and hand dominance , 
height/weight for body mass index and arm circumferential measurements  at the 
wrist, 1” below the antecubital fossa and 3” above the antecubital fossa .  There will 
be a checklist on the data sheet to ensure participants are meeting inclusion criteria 
for the study.  
 
All orthoses will be fit or fabricated on the dominant hand.  
 
The subject will be fit with a prefabricated Hely & Weber MTC Fracture Brace .  
Directions for fitting are depi[INVESTIGATOR_704138]://www.hely -

secured with Velcro.   Directions for fabricated are written below.  
 
1). Place desired width stockinet  on the subjects arm from the metacarpal 
phalangeal joints to 4” above the elbow  
2). Pad the ulnar sty loid with Reston  
3). Measure the length of material required from metacarpal phalangeal joint to 4” 
above the elbow  
4). Measure the 75% of the circumference of the arm at the metacarpal phalangeal 
joints, wrist, and elbow.  
5). Cut out orthoplast with meas urements  
6). Use the 2” high stretch bandage  and start at the metacarpal phalangeal joints 
mold the orthoplast to the arm using the high stretch bandage with the shoulder at 
[ADDRESS_956587] in 10 -20 degrees extension , 
and neutral deviation.  
7). Draw cutting lines on the orthosis for these principles  
 a). Full metacarpal phalangeal joint flexion of digits II -V 
 b). Follow the line of the third metacarpal for trim placements volar and dorsal.  
 c). At  the elbow the lateral and medial epi[INVESTIGATOR_704139].  
 d). On the posterior side and from the olecranon  trim the orthosis 4.5 inches

  Page [ADDRESS_956589] all passed the Mayo competency in fabricating 
muenster  orthoses.  
 
Patients will be randomized into one of 5 groups. Randomization will be conducted 
using sealed envelopes prepared using a randomization schedule provided by [CONTACT_26063]. The schedule will randomize in 5 blocks of 6 (123; 132; 213; 2 31; 
312, 321) to  avoid over allocation of the subjects into one group.  
 
The Hely & Weber MTC Fracture Brace is [ADDRESS_956590]’s dominant arm 
will be covered to reduce bias. Each subject will have 3 trials of goniometry for 
pronation and supi[INVESTIGATOR_20810]. Terminal motion will be based upon the patient 
experiencing increased pressure or felt restriction from the orthosis. The odd number 
subjects will supi[INVESTIGATOR_265263]/pronate, supi[INVESTIGATOR_265263]/pronate, supi[INVESTIGATOR_265263]/pronate.  The even 
number subjects will pronate/supi[INVESTIGATOR_265263], pronate/supi[INVESTIGATOR_704141]/supi[INVESTIGATOR_265263].  
 
At the completion of measuring all three orthoses, the subjects will fill out the [ADDRESS_956591] goniometer. The subjects will be blinded to the 
recorded data while performing supi[INVESTIGATOR_20810]/pronation as well.  
2.3.[ADDRESS_956592] deviation of 
the pronation -supi[INVESTIGATOR_704142] 10 °. Assuming that 
similar variability will be observed in the proposed study, a sample of [ADDRESS_956593] 80% power to detect a difference of at least 6 ° between any two 
of the [ADDRESS_956594] deviations for continuous variables, and counts and 
percentages for categorical variables. Results will be reported with 95% confidence 
intervals where appropriate. The analysis will focus on comparing the mean 
pronation -supi[INVESTIGATOR_704143] 3 different orthoses.  This will be 
accomplished using repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). If the overall 
ANOVA result is statistically significant, further analysis will be undertaken to 
perform pairwise comparisons between the 3 study  groups using an appropriate 
multiple comparisons procedure (such as the Tukey -Kramer method) to control the 
overall type -I error rate.  All statistical tests will be two -sided and p -values less than 
0.[ADDRESS_956595] Retention  
The questionnaires filled out by [CONTACT_704151].  The records w ill be kept in a locked filling 
cabinet at Mayo C linic.  The data will also be housed in a secure data form such 
as an Excel Spreadsheet or Red Cap data base.

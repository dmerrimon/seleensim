DESIGN:  TechStep is a three -arm, technology -based randomized 
controlled trial (RCT), with a stepped care approach, 
among high -risk HIV -negative t rans youth  and young 
adults (YYA) for reducing sexual risk behaviors and 
increasing PrEP uptake .   
  
DURATION:  Trans YYA are enrolled for [ADDRESS_1004543] . 
  
SAMPLE SIZE:  Total study sample is 355 of which the following will b e 
enrolled for each phase: 1) up to 80 participants for f ocus 
groups to inf orm intervention adaption; 2) 275 participants 
for a r andomized controlled trial of TechStep , with 
participants randomized to either text messaging stepped 
care (n= 108), WebA pp stepped care (n=83)  or control 
(n=83) condition . 
   
POPULATION:  Participants will include YYA who are self -identified trans 
feminine, trans masculine or gender non-conforming  or 
whose birth sex and current gender do not match ; age s 
15 to 24 years; HIV-negative; and sexually active . For 
Phase 1, participants must self -report never having 
received a posi tive HIV test result; participants  age [ADDRESS_1004544] report vaginal or anal 
sex (either insertive  or receptive; excluding sex toys) in 
the previous [ADDRESS_1004545] a confirmed HIV negative serostatus and report anal 
or vaginal  sex (either  insertive or receptive ; excluding sex 
toys) in the previous 12 months.  For Phase 2,  participants 
will be recruited from SRVs in Houston, Los Angeles, 
[LOCATION_001] City, Philadelphia , and [LOCATION_011] .   
  
STRATIFICATION:  Focus group discussions will be stratified by [CONTACT_654]  (50% 15 -
20 years old ; 50% 2 1-24 years old ). 
  
DATA  
COLLECTION:  Focus group discussi ons will be conducted in -person, 
digitally recorded, and professionally transcribed. There 
will be five data collection  (screening, baseline, 3 -month, 
6-month, and 9-month ) time points for the R CT. Visits will

panel, urine screen  for recent illicit drug use , and blood 
microsampling , for those who report PrEP uptake, to 
verify PrEP adhe rence  will be collected  in-person at the 
participant’s SRV  or via mailed self -collection kits . HIV 
testing during enrollment is mandatory, and encouraged 
during follow -ups. All biological specimen collection  with 
the excepton of HIV testing at enrollment  is optional but 
encouraged.  Process data of participant activity at each 
step of the intervention, as well as the  control 
intervention,  will be collected.   
  
OBJECTIVES : Primary Aim 1:  Conduct formative research to develop 
the stepped care (text messaging, WebApp, and 
eCoaching) interventions and refine iterations through 
input from focus groups with trans YYA at the four study 
sites (n=80) and a youth advisory board (YAB).  
 
Primary Aim 2:  In a [ADDRESS_1004547] (N=2 75), assess the 
differential immediate and sustained effects of a low 
intensity information (“Info”) arm compared to a text 
messaging stepped care intervention (text messaging 
plus step to eCoaching for YYA with continued high risk) 
arm compared to a  WebApp stepped  care intervention 
(WebApp plus  step to eCoaching for YYA with continued 
high risk) arm for reducing sexual risk behaviors and 
increasing  PrEP  uptake among high -risk, HIV -negative 
trans (15 -24 years old).  
 
Secondary Ai m 3: Determine the added benefit of  text 
messaging plus eCoaching versus text messaging alone 
and of WebApp plus eCoaching versus WebApp alone  for 
reducing sexual risk behaviors and increasing  PrEP 
uptake.  
 
Secondary  Aim 4: Assess the differential immediat e and 
sustained effects of low intensity information compared to 
text messaging only compared to WebApp only for 
reducing sexual risk behaviors and 
increasing  PrEP  uptake.  
 
Secondary Aim 5: Determine the impact of structural - 
(e.g., transphobia, housing insecurity, educational 
attainment, access to healthcare) and individual -level (e.g., 
identity formation, gender transition, gender expression,

 1.0  INTRODUCTION  
1.1 Background  
National evidence suggests  that as  many  as 8% of US youth  self-identify  as either “transgender,” 
“gender nonconforming,”  or “other gender”.7 Evidence further demonstrates  that t rans youth  face 
a “health  syndemic,” i.e.,  a set of reinforcing  structural,  cultural, and behavioral  factors  that place 
trans youth at dramatically  increased ris k for negative physical,  social,  and mental  health  
outcomes.8-11 For example,  trans youth demonstrate significantly  elevated rates  of sexual risk -
taking relative to  their cisgender/gender -conforming peers,9,12,13,14  including  rates of condomless  
anal intercourse  ranging  from 27-59% and  rates  of engagement in sex  work ranging from 24 -
75%.1,14 Increased  rates  of sexual risk behavior(s)  among  trans youth are associated with the 
population’s  increased  experiences  of physical/sexual  abuse and victimization,  mental health  
disorder,  incarceration,  and homelessness,9,14,15 as well as  substance use,  sex work,  and 
substance use during sex.2,9,14 Due to this  health  syndemic,  trans youth are at substantially  
increased risk  for HIV infection, as  well as other  STIs, relative to  their cisgender  youth  
counterparts.1,2 Despi[INVESTIGATOR_735143],  there  is persistent  evidence of inadequate  training  regarding 
the care  of trans youth among  traditional healthcare  providers;16 the difficulties  trans youth  report  
accessing traditional healthcare13,17 and the  frequent reports by  [CONTACT_735160]/discrimination when  receiving  traditional healthcare17,[ADDRESS_1004548]  their mobile  device  with them.  This “always  on” feature  allows  mobile  
interventions  to be delivered  during  times  when  users  need  relevant  intervention  the most. Finally,  
interventions  delivered  via mobile  phone  can also be delivered  at no/low  cost, provide  a high  
degree  of confidentiality,  and cultivate  motivational  communication  among  users,  all elements  of 
special  relevance to trans youth  populations.28 
All adolescents,  including  trans youth,19 demonstrate  frequent  use of text messaging  and mobile  
Internet -enabled  technology  to seek  out protective  sexual health  information.20 Trans youth  
explicitly  cite mobile  phones  as critical  tools  in their ability  to engage  with sexual  health  
information,  as text messaging  conversations, mobile  apps,  and other  mHealth  delivery  modalities  
provide  portals  where  trans youth  report  feeling  comfortable  to seek  out health -related  knowledge  
specific  to trans individuals  (e.g., hormone therapy,  pubertal  suppression21) adopt  and express  new 
and different  identities, connect  to other  trans youth  to seek  out information  and resources.19,22,23 
Evidence  demonstrates  that youth  find text messages  about  sexual  health  easy  to understand, 
trustworthy, friendly,  convenient,  and that the text message  format  promotes  the ability  to 
assimilate  and share  sexual  health  information  at their own pace;  youth  also indicate  that sexual  
health  messages  delivered  via text increase  confidence and  reduce  sexual  stigma.[ADDRESS_1004549]  brick-and-mortar 
treatment.27 
ATN 160 – TechStep  Version 4.1  16-July-2021   
Page 11 of 47 
 Although  systematic  review  indicates  that mobile  health  interventions  are particularly  efficacious  at 
increasing  HIV protective  behaviors  among  vulnerable  and key HIV risk populations  such  as trans 
youth,28 a recent  systematic  review  revealed  that only 18% of mobile  phone -based  HIV 
prevention/care  interventions  provide  any information  tailored  to LGBT  populations, and  none  
were  tailored  specifically  to trans individuals.29 One digital  intervention  designed  for LGBT  youth,  
but not specifically  tailored  for trans youth, successfully  increased safer sex  outcomes  among  
participants,30 and another  intervention  designed  for young  African  American/Black  MSM  and trans  
women,  but was not specifically  for trans  women,  demonstrated  significant  improvements  in 
participant  social  support,  social isolation, and  depressive symptoms.31,32 The TechStep study  will 
fill a critical gap  in the scientific  advancement  of technology -based  interventions  for trans youth  by 
a) creating  the first technology -based  trans youth -specific  HIV prevention  interventions  optimized  
for mobile  phone  delivery;  and, b) employing  the two intervention  delivery  modalities  identified  as 
most  promising  for use among  trans YYA (i.e., text messaging  and mobile  app). 
As part of the UNC/Emory Center for Innovative Technology (iTech), we propose to test the 
efficacy of TechStep for t rans YYA. In this 4 -year study, 275 high-risk t rans YYA between the 
ages of 15 -24 will be randomized to receive text messaging, a WebApp,  or an information -only 
control intervention for 6 months , with assessments occurring at baseline and 3 -, 6- and 9 -months . 
YYA who do not evidence improvements in sexual risk and/or PrEP uptake at the 3 -month 
assessment will be randomized to either receive weekly eCoaching  sessions in addition to their 
assigned text messaging or WebApp intervention, or remain in the original intervention in a 2:1 
ratio. The primary endpoint is reduced sexual risk behaviors and/or PrEP uptake, adherence and 
persistence  at month 6.  
1.2  Rationale  
There is a clear need to develop effective prevention  interventions that meet the needs of trans 
YYA. Trans YYA – especially racial and ethnic minorities – are at very high risk for acquiring HIV 
and other STIs, the impact of which is compounded by [CONTACT_3433] e lack of culturally competent healthcare 
providers . For this reason , the suite of technology -based interventions dev eloped in TechStep 
and assessed for effectiveness in a 3-arm RCT  represents an important advance in intervention 
science toward developi[INVESTIGATOR_735144].  
1.2.1 Youth Advisory Boards (YAB)  of trans YYA 
 
Two Youth Advisory Boards will be convened . There will be a physical YAB in Los Angeles, and 
a virtual cross -site YAB via telecommunication comprised  of members from the Houston, New 
York, and Philadelphia SRVs. The YABs will meet biannually throughout the cour se of the study 
and will provide feedback on all aspects of the TechStep study including the technology -based 
interventions, stepped care design, recruitment strategies, culturally competent study materials, 
and implementation. YAB participants provide exp ert advice and are not considered human 
subjects under the IRB.  
1.2.2 Focus groups with trans YYA 
 
Eight focus groups (two each in Houston, Los Angeles, [LOCATION_001] and Philadelphia ) will be 
conducted to gain feedback from trans YYA about the existing text messaging and WebApp 
interventions that will serve as the starting points for adapting these intervention approaches. 
Focus groups will be conducted at four SRVs (Houston, Los Angeles, [LOCATION_001] City, and 
Philadelphia), two of which (Houston & Los Angeles ) will focus on gaining feedback on the 
WebApp and two of which ( [LOCATION_001]  & Philadelphia) will focus on gaining feedback on the text 
ATN 160 – TechStep  Version 4.[ADDRESS_1004550] of  TechStep  will be conducted  with the following conditions: 1) a  text messaging 
stepped care  intervention , 2) a  WebApp stepped care intervention , and 3) a low -intensity 
information  control group. Those in either of the active technology -based intervention condition s 
who do not report a reduction in  sexual risk and have not started PrEP , or those who report a 
reduction in sexual risk but have discontinued PrEP since their last assessment will be 
randomized to either step up to receive the technology -based intervention (text or WebApp) plus 
weekly eCoaching sessions  or to remain on the original intervention .. The control group will 
consist of information about t rans health, HIV/STI information and local resources for t rans 
persons . A RCT was chosen since it is the gold standard for assessing the effectiveness of an 
intervention under tightly controlled conditions. The intervention and control group s will have 
acce ss to information and intervention content for 6 months, with ACASI performed at baseline, 
and every 3 months thereafter for 9 months (i.e., 3 -month, 6 -month, & 9-month follow -up 
assessments) . At all follow -up assessments, t rans YYA will be assessed for their sexual risk  
behaviors  and PrEP uptake , adherence and persistence . Assessments will include self -reported 
behavioral data, and biomarkers for HIV, STIs, current drug use, and PrEP adherence and 
persistence.  
2.0 STUDY OBJECTIVES  
Primary Aim 1:  Conduct formative research to develop the stepped care (text 
messaging, WebApp,  and eCoaching) interventions and refine iterations through input 
from focus groups with trans youth and young adults (YYA) at the four study sites (n=80) 
and a youth advisory board (YAB).  
 
Primary Aim 2:   
 
In a [ADDRESS_1004551] (N=2 75), assess the differential immediate and sustained effects of a low intensity 
information (“Info”) arm compared to a text messaging stepped care intervention (text messaging 
plus step to eCoaching for YYA with continued high risk) arm compared to a  WebApp 
stepped  care intervention (WebApp plus step to eCoaching for YYA with continued high risk) arm 
for reducing sexual risk behaviors and increasing  PrEP  uptake among high -risk, HIV -negative 
trans (15 -24 year s old).  
 
Hypothesis 1a : There will be significantly greater reductions in sexual risk behaviors among 
those in  the Text+Step  and App+Step  arms compared to  the low intensity Info arm . 
 
Hypothesis 1b : There will be significantly greater uptake of PrEP among those in the  
Text+Step  and App+Step  arms compared to  the low intensity Info arm.  
 
Secondary Aim 3:   
 
Determine the added benefit of  text messaging plus eCoaching versus text messaging alone and 
of WebApp plus eCoaching versus WebApp alone  for reducing sexual risk behaviors and 
ATN 160 – TechStep  Version 4.1  16-July-2021   
Page 13 of 47 
 increasing  PrEP uptake.  
 
Secondary Aim 4 : Assess the differential immediate and sustained effects of low intensity 
information compa red to text messaging only compared to WebApp only for reducing sexual risk 
behaviors and increasing  PrEP  uptake.  
 
Secondary Aim 5: Determine the impact of structural - (e.g., transphobia, housing insecurity, 
educational attainment, access to healthcare) an d individual -level (e.g., identity formation, 
gender transition, gender expression, stigma, discrimination) trans -specific factors as 
moderators of intervention  outcomes.  
 
Hypothesis 2: Structural - and individual -level t rans-specific factors will moderate intervention 
outcomes, such that participa nts who report higher amounts and degrees of these factors 
will require more intensive intervention steps (i.e., eCoaching).  
 
 
3.[ADDRESS_1004552] s (YABs) to inform intervention features and content, as well as conduct focus 
groups to seek input into intervention components. In Phase 2, TechStep  will be evaluated in  a 
randomized controlled efficacy trial (see TechStep Schema). For Phase 1, all participants (n=80) 
must meet the eligibility criteria listed in Section 4.  A recruitment target of 275 HIV-negative t rans 
YYA will be enrolled in Phase 2 to assess whether Text+Step or WebApp+Step  is more  effective 
in reducing sexual risk behaviors and increasing PrEP uptake, adherence and persistence for 
HIV-negative t rans YYA than a low -intensity control condition . Trans YYA will be recruited from 5 
SRVs ( [LOCATION_011], Houston, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, [LOCATION_001] ), screened, and randomized to 
receive either the Text+Step  intervention , the App+Step intervention,  or basic information on 
HIV/STIs, trans health, and referrals only in the control condition. The step component may 
provid e weekly eCoaching sessions in addition to the original intervention (i.e. text or app) for 
YYA who do not evidence improvement in sexual risk and/or PrEP uptake. Sexual risk behaviors 
and PrEP uptake, adhe rence, and persistence will be assessed at the enrollment visit, and 3-, 6-
, and 9-month  follow -up assessment time points .  
Phase 1: Formative Research and Community Input   
Two Youth Advisory Boards will be convened. There will be a physical YAB in Los Angeles, and 
a virtual cross -site YAB via telecommunication comprised of members from the Houston, New 
York, and Philadelphia SRVs. The YABs will meet  at least  biannually throu ghout the course of 
the study and will provide feedback on all aspects of the TechStep study including the technology -
based interventions, stepped care design, recruitment strategies, culturally competent study 
materials, and implementation.   
We will condu ct two focus groups with up to  10 trans YYA per group, at 4 SRVs  (8 focus groups 
total) . At each SRV, o ne focus group will consist of participants between the ages of 15 -20 and 
the other focus group will be with participants between the ages of 21 -24. Focus groups in 
Houston and Los Angeles  will be used to gain feedback on the WebApp  (also referred to in th is 
protocol as an “app”)  component of the intervention, while focus groups in [LOCATION_001]  and 
Philadelphia will be used to gain feedback on the text messaging component of the intervention.

 Focus groups will be transcribed verbatim and a content analysis will  be assisted by [CONTACT_687868] (AC).  
Phase 2 : Randomized Control led Trial to Test Efficacy of TechStep  
Trans YYA will be recruited from 5 SRVs ( [LOCATION_011], Houston, Los Angeles, [LOCATION_001], and 
Philadelphia ) to participate in a 3-arm RCT to determine immediate and sustained effects of  the 
Text+Step intervention  versus the App+Step intervention compared to an information -only control 
condition (“Info” arm) . All participants will receive one of the intervention s for 6 months, with 
assessments o ccurring at baseline and every 3 months thereafter until month  9. Trans YYA 
randomized to either of the technology -based intervention arm s (Text or WebApp) will be 
evaluated at the 3 -month follow -up assessment time points to determine if they remain at the  
current level of intervention, or if they are eligible for randomization to also receive  eCoaching  
sessions  in addition to their originally  assinged intervention . All participants assigned to the 
Text+Step intervention arm will begin with the text messaging intervention. Participants assigned 
to the App+Step intervention arm will begin with the WebApp intervention. At the first follow -up 
assessment time point, information about their sexual behavior in the past 3 months and whether 
they began or stopped using PrEP will be used to determine if they require a more intensive 
intervention approach . Participants who do not demonstrate intervention responsiveness at the 
3-month follow -up assessment will be re -randomized , in a 2:1 r atio, to either  remain in the original 
technology -based intervention (i.e., Text or App) or add eCoaching to the original technology -
based intervention (i.e., Text+eCoaching or App+eCoaching) . This re -randomization will allow for 
a comparison of intervent ion effects between the technology -based intervention s (i.e., text or app) 
plus eCoaching to the technology -based interv ention alone. The control condition will receive the 
same information -only intervention for the entire 6-month  intervention period . 
3.2  Study Population  
We propose to enroll  355 trans YYA for the purposes  of this study. Up to  80 participants will be 
recruited for focus group discussions ( with the goal of 5-7, a minimum of 3  and a maximum of 10 
per group), and 275 participants  (n=108 Text+Step, n=83 App+Step  and n= 83 control)  will be 
recruited to participate in the TechStep  RCT.  
Inclusion criteria for the focus groups and RCT are described in Section 4.0 (note: the Youth 
Advisory Board  members are not considered human subjects for research and , therefore , 
inclusion criteria are not listed for YABs) . 
 
3.3 Study Randomization, Stratification, or Description of Non -Random Assignment

4.3 Recruitment   
The following  recruitment strategies  will be utilized  to ensure  enrollment targets  are met and  a 
diversity  of participants  are enrolled. 1) Online  Recruitment:  Online  banner  ads targeting trans  YYA 
will be placed  through  geo-mappi[INVESTIGATOR_735145]. We will also 
distribute digital flyers to community leaders who will inform their email distribution lists with 
information on how to participate in the study.  Additional online recruitment may also be 
conducted, including but not limited to recruiting via online social media outlets (e. g., Facebook, 
ATN 160 – TechStep  Version 4.1  16-July-2021   
Page 18 of 47 
 Instagram, Snapchat, etc.).  2) SRV and other Community -based Outreach:  flyers and posters will 
be created and distributed in SRVs and other community -based organizations and clinic settings 
that cater to trans YYA. The flyers and posters  will contain  details  about  how to contact  a SRV 
Research  Assistant for further  information  or how to screen online for the RCT. 3) Peer Referral:  
Participants  who screen eligible for the RCT  will be asked  to refer friend s who are also trans YYA. 
For the RCT, we will follow respondent -driven sampling (RDS) methods and use a long -chain 
referral method to supplement recruitment, especially with the adolescents (15 -17) who may be 
harder to reach than young adults (18 -24). 4) Clinic -based recruitment may include reviewing 
medical charts of existing patients for potential eligibility, or referrals from other providers in the 
clinic. 5) Former participants who have previously given consent to be contact[CONTACT_735161] . 6) Print Media:  Ads will be 
placed  in print media  that trans  YYA read.  7) Street - and Venue -based  Outreach: Research  
Assistants  will utilize  a semi -structured  time-space  sampling  methodology  to conduct street - and 
venue -based  outreach  identified  through  the Trans  Youth  Community  Advisory Board  and ongoing  
community  mappi[INVESTIGATOR_735146]. Research  Assistants  will be 
trained  on appropriate  outreach  strategies,  how to build and maintain  ongoing  trust and rapport,  
and how to conduct  confidential  screening.  
4.4 Screening  
All potential participants (whether recruited online , in-person  or over the phone ) will complete an 
online screening survey to obtain consent/assent to be screened and verify all inclusion criteria. 
Screening may occur on the same day as enrollment or beforehand. The online screening survey 
will begin with a script that will be read by  [CONTACT_735162], they will be invited to participate in the study. The script will also 
provide general information about the research study, the nature of the screening questions and 
related potential risks, the approximate length of the  screening (~5 minutes), the confidentiality 
of the screening information, the use of any screening information obtained, the ability to skip any 
questions or withdraw at any time, and contact [CONTACT_735163]. After reading 
this screening script, participants will be asked if they are interested in participating and agree to 
voluntarily complete the screening procedure. Participants will electronically indicate their 
agreement and the n take the screening survey.  
SRV staff ma y also screen  participants using the online screener in person , over the phone , or 
over a teleconferencing platform such as Zoom or a comparable platform . The SRV staff will 
obtain verbal consent from the participant to screen, read the screening questions from the the 
online survey to the participant, and record the participant’s responses in the online screener .  
The online survey is hosted on Alchemer  and we will use SSL encryption for transfers of 
information online and data will be stored in the secure, HIPAA -compliant servers of Alchemer . 
The Emory AC team maintains a business partner H IPAA agreement with Alchemer .  For those 
who meet eligibility criteria, the survey will ask if they are willing to provide  their first name, e -mail, 
and a phone number. Potential participants who do not meet eligibility criteria will be asked if they 
would  like to be contact[CONTACT_735164], if so, to provide contact [CONTACT_3031].  
The Analytic Core will securely share the contact [CONTACT_735165] a secure Box  or Microsoft OneDrive  account. SRV staff w ill enter the eligible participant 
into SMART for scheduling and contact [CONTACT_287604] -person visit at the SRV  or 
an online enrollment visit . Study staff also have the option of scheduling and completing some 
study visit activities in pers on and some of the study visit activities online to provide flexibility 
during the COVID -19 pandemic  and afterwards  and to be responsive to participant needs.  
ATN 160 – TechStep  Version 4.[ADDRESS_1004554] information will be contact[CONTACT_735166]  (in Phase 1) or to schedule 
an in person or online  baseline  enrollment visit  (in Phase 2) . An email will be sent to potential 
focus group participants immediate ly after they are scheduled for the focus group that includes 
the focus group date, time, location and staff contact [CONTACT_3031]. Potential focus group 
participants will be sen t a reminder three days prior to the focus group, as well as on the day of 
the focus group.  
YYA who screen ineligible (see section 4.2 for exclusion criteria) will be informed at the conclusion 
of the screener that they are not eligible for the study.  
 
4.4.[ADDRESS_1004555] Info  
Once the participant is consented/assented, designated site study staff will complete a 
Locator/Contact [CONTACT_735167]/or enter the participant’s contact 
[CONTACT_374021]. Parti cipants will be asked to 
provide a working phone number and/or valid email address through which they can be reached. 
Participants will also be asked to provide social media contact [CONTACT_3031]. Participants will also 
be asked to provide valid contact [CONTACT_735168]/or friends who can be 
called in the event the participant cannot be reached by [CONTACT_61529]. Participants will be asked 
if messages can be left at the numbers provided. Study staff will not leave messages unless 
express ly permitted to do so by [CONTACT_112494]. If 
permission is given to leave messages, site study staff will assure participants that messages left 
with a family member or friend will only ask the participant to cont act study staff and will not 
include any protected health information or information related to study participation. For 
participants  randomized to the e Coaching intervention, the e Coaches based at PRIDE will ask 
participants in the e Coaching intervention to provide them with contact [CONTACT_735169].  
 
4.5 Informed Consent  
Informed consent/assent.  The informed consent process will occur on the day the enrollment 
visit is held. Consent may be done online, in person, or over the phone . A teleconference platform 
such as Zoom (see Section 7.3.6 for description of the Zoom platform) or other comparable 
platform will be used for online study visits and consenting . Interested persons will be g uided 
through the informed consent process by [CONTACT_464] , who will explain all study procedures , answer 
questions concerning the study and consent process , and offer a copy of the informed 
consent/assent form . The research staff member will give the parti cipant as much time as needed 
and will address any questions or concerns they may have. The participant will be allowed to take 
the consent/assent form home and review it before enrolling in the study if the participant needs 
more time to review the form. The research staff member will ask the participant questions to 
gauge comprehension. The consent/assent form describes all study procedures, including 
confidentiality and privacy, information about potential risks, discomforts, benefits of participation, 
and information regarding who they can contact [CONTACT_112488]. It also states that 
participation is voluntary, that participants may decide not to take part or to withdraw from the 
study at any time without penalty or loss of any benefit to which th ey might otherwise be entitled, 
and that study participation is in no way related to being able to access or continue getting care 
or services at any participating study site. Participants can refuse to answer any question, and 
can withdraw from the study at any time. The PIs, Co -PIs, or designee at each site will review all 
informed consents and assents.  The informed consent/assent form may be on paper or online 
ATN 160 – TechStep  Version 4.1  16-July-2021   
Page 20 of 47 
 via a HIPAA -compliant, secure online platform, such as Alchemer  or Qualtrics (see Section 7.3. 7 
for details on Qualtrics).  
 
Assessing for decisional capacity.  For all participants, the research assistant (RA) reviews the 
informed consent/assent to make an  assessment of the participant ’s decisional capacity and 
ability to provide consent /assent prior to signing, using a [ADDRESS_1004556], the RA determines 
if the person understands the study goals by [CONTACT_7939]  a question such as , “Can you tell me what 
this study is about?” In step 2, potential participants will be asked questions designe d to assess 
their capacity to understand, appreciate, reason with, and express a choice about participation in 
our specific protocol. Participants will be asked to: name [CONTACT_735193]; explain what they would do if the y no longer wished to participate in the study ; explain 
what they would do if they experienced distress during the study; and identify potential risks for 
participating in the study. For YYA who cannot answer these questions, the RA will go back and 
review  the relevant elements of consent with the participant again and repeat the process. YYA 
who appear not to understand after repeated review will not be enrolled in the study.  If the 
enrollment process occurs online, research staff will talk with potential participants via phone or 
online teleconference platform such as Zoom (see Section 7.3.6 for description of the Zoom 
platform) or other comparable platform to assess for decisional capacity and to address any 
questions or concerns the person may have.  
Waiv er of parental consent.  We will request that the UNC -CH IRB as the central IRB (IRB of 
Record) grant a waiver of parental consent  to participate in this research study for youth 
participants who are 15 to 17 years of age. The research team has been granted waivers of 
parental permission for prior studies with sexual minority youth. Under 45 CFR 46.408 (c), an IRB 
has the authority t o waive parental permission if it determines that “a research protocol is designed 
for conditions or a subject population for which parental or guardian permission is not a 
reasonable requirement to protect the subjects” and “an appropriate mechanism for p rotecting 
the children who will participate as research subjects is substituted” and “that the waiver is not 
inconsistent with Federal, State, or local law.” A waiver of signed consent and parental/legal 
guardian permission will be sought given that minor individuals can often seek sexually 
transmitted infection (STI) and HIV testing  without parental/legal guardian permission, depending 
on each site’s state laws , and given that many of the trans youth in our study are likely to be 
gender and/or sexually flu id or have an attraction to persons of the same gender, but may not be 
“out” to their parents; requiring parental permission may place participants at risk for disclosing 
as part of the LGBT community or being at risk for HIV infection . A waiver of parenta l permission 
for studies with LGBT youth that do not involve greater than minimal risk is a common practice 
among researchers working in the area of gay and lesbian health/mental health. This is done to 
avoid the selection biases operating in only recruiti ng youth whose parents are both aware of and 
comfortable with their sexual or gender identity . Commonly, these youth have explored their 
sexuality  or gender expression without their parents’ knowledge as the youth struggle with issues 
of disclosure and its  consequences within the social, religious, and economic context of their 
families. A requirement for parental permission in this type of study could not only affect a person’s 
willingness to participate, but could also potentially impact the ability of re searchers to engage in 
this type of research with gender and sexual minority youth.  
 
If the purpose of requiring parental permission as stated in CFR is to protect the minor subject, 
then requiring parental permission for youth in these circumstances is no t a reasonable 
requirement.  Additional privacy protections are provided in that all assessments, notes, reports, 
and other records will be identified by [INVESTIGATOR_13701] a coded number to maintain participant confidentiality. 
These records and any forms that do conta in identifying information (e.g., consent/assent forms, 
ATN 160 – TechStep  Version 4.[ADDRESS_1004557] information) will be kept in a locked, limited access area (such as a locked file cabinet) at 
the participating site.  
 
5.0  STUDY PROCEDURES  
5.1 Enrollment Procedures  
5.1.1 Focus group enrollment  
 
Screening procedures are explained above in section 4.4. All persons who screen eligible for the 
study will be guided through the informed consent process (section 4.5) on the day the focus 
group is held.  Research staff administering the consen t process will pay particular attention to 
whether the potential participant appears confused or otherwise unable to complete the informed 
consent process, and will stop enrollment of that participant in the focus group.  
Following informed consent, trans YYA will be walked to the focus group room where they will 
complete a brief paper -and-pencil Focus Group Participant S urvey (e.g., additional demographics 
and technology use survey) before the focus group begins.  After informed consent/assent is 
obtained a nd the Focus Group Participant Survey is completed, participants will be deemed 
enrolled in the study.  
 
Participants will be compensated for their time once the focus group has ended. Participants who 
leave the focus group early will be compensated the sa me amount regardless of how long they 
are present.  
 
5.1.[ADDRESS_1004558] Enrollment  
Screening procedures are explained above in section 4.4. All persons who screen eligible for the 
study will be guided through the informed consent process (section 4.5) on the day of  their 
enrollment appointment. Research staff administering the consent process will pay particular 
attention to whether the potential participant appears confused or otherwise unable to complete 
the informed consent process, and will stop enrollment of th at participant in the RCT.  
Following informed consent, trans YYA will go through baseline assessment procedures of  having 
HIV testing, blood microsampling  analysis for those who self -report PrEP use, screening for STIs 
and drug use through a urine screen  (note: HIV testing is the only required biological specimen 
collection, all others are voluntary) , and the survey measures through an ACASI. Biological 
specimen collection may be done in person during the study visit or via self collection kits mail ed 
to participants. For mailed self collection, the biological specimens may be collected after the 
baseline enrollment visit  and must be returned within 90 days . After randomization, participants 
will receive more information about the arm they are random ized into (e.g. how to use the 
WebApp, the frequency of text messages, or how to access the resources and information). For 
in person enrollment visits, participants will be deemed enrolled in the study a fter baseline 
procedures  and the enrollment visit  are completed . For online enrollment visits, participants will 
be deemed enrolled in the study after they are randomized and onboarded.  
ATN 160 – TechStep  Version 4.[ADDRESS_1004559], after completion of the baseline ACASI, participants will be randomized 1:1:1 to 
the Text+Step intervention or App+Step intervention or control condition, based on a 
randomization sequence dev eloped by [CONTACT_735170]  (see 
section 7.4.1 for more details on DFexplore ). The randomization sequence will be stratified by [CONTACT_735171] 3.  
 
5.3 Intervention/Investigation Procedures  
5.3.1 Focus Groups  
Focus groups will  be conducted in person and at 4  SRVs ( Houston, Los Angeles, [LOCATION_001], and 
Philadelphia ). Two focus groups will be cond ucted at each of the [ADDRESS_1004560] the focus groups. The focus groups conducted in New 
York and Philadelphia will be used to gain feedback from t rans YYA on the text messaging 
intervention of  TechStep, while the focus groups in Houston and Los Angeles will be used to gain 
feedback on the WebApp. All focus groups will be audio recorded (equipment provided by [CONTACT_75275] ). The Protocol Chair will coordinate with SRV staff to arrange parti cipant 
compensation at the end of each focus group.  A minimum of [ADDRESS_1004561] will be conducted in person or or online at 5 SRVs ([LOCATION_011], Houston, Los 
Angeles, [LOCATION_001], and Philadelphia). Online study visits may be carried out via an online 
videoconferencing software,  such as Zoom (see Section 7.3.6  for description of the Zoom 
platform) or a comparable platform.  
 
Enrollment procedures are  anticipated to last approximately 120 minutes and consists of informed 
consent/assent, the baseline ACASI survey, and HIV , STI and drug screen testing , and blood 
microsampling for those who self -report PrEP use  (of the biological specimen collection, only HIV 
ATN 160 – TechStep  Version 4.1  16-July-2021   
Page 23 of 47 
 testing is mandatory) . For online enrollment visits, some or all of the biological specimen collection 
may be done via mailed self -collection kits after the enr ollment visit.  Participants , if they choose 
to do so,  will be able to meet with research staff via live, secure video chat, to answer questions 
about the at -home self -collection kit components and procedures. Particularly, study staff will be 
able to answe r questions and go over results of rapid HIV test results if participants prefer to self -
administer a rapid test in addition to or in lieu of a lab processed HIV test.  Rapid HIV test results 
will be confirmed with research staff via secure video chat, or b y uploading a photo of the test 
results to a secure online survey  hosted by [CONTACT_440731].  During enrollment, participants will be 
randomized into either the Text+Step arm, the App+Step arm, or the information -only (i.e. “Info”) 
arm. Participants randomized int o the Text+Step arm will be given information about the 
frequency of text messages they should expect. Participants randomized into the App+Step arm 
will be guided by [CONTACT_735172]. Participants randomized into the “Info” arm will learn how 
they will gain  access  to the information available in that arm  and the basic description of that 
information . At the end of the enrollment visit, all participants will be invited to schedule their [ADDRESS_1004562] 
results to a secure online survey  hosted by [CONTACT_440731]. Participants in the technology -based 
intervention groups (i.e. the Text+Step or the App+Step arm)  that do not reduce sexual ri sk 
behaviors  or self -report a recent STI diagnosis  and do not initiate PrEP or adhere to PrEP at 
effective levels will be randomized 2:1 into either additional eCoaching with their technology -
based intervention or remain with their originally  assigned intervention . Steppi[INVESTIGATOR_735147] a series of questions: 1) participants that self report PrEP adherence (4+ doses 
taken per week for each of the past 2 weeks) will not step, otherwise: 2) participants who self -
report a new STI (syphillis, chlamydia, or gonnorhea) diagnosed outside of the study in the past 
3 months will be eligible for step by [CONTACT_17628], otherwise; 3) participans who self -report 
sexual risk in the  form of: a) condomless anal or vaginal sex, b) sex with exchange partners, c) 
sex while feeling the effects of stimulants (methamphetamine, powder cocaine, or crack cocaine) 
or d) sex after binge drinking (5+ drinks at one time) in the past three months w ill be eligble for 
step by [CONTACT_17628]. Those that are randomized to step up to additional eCoaching will meet 
the eCoach  online  at the 3 -month visit  or during the 3 -month visit window  for an introductory visit 
and to schedule their next eCoaching sessio n. 
Participants can schedule and attend a 6 -month follow -up visit  in person or online  as early as 14 
days prior to the calendar date that falls six months after their enrollment date, and as late as 75 
days after the calendar date that falls six months aft er their enrollment date. At the 6 -month follow -
up visit, particpants will undergo additional HIV, STIs and drug screen testing , blood 
microsampling for those who report PrEP uptake or continued use,  as well as take an other  ACASI 
survey . Of the biological specimen tests, only HIV testing is required, however the others (i.e. , 
ATN 160 – TechStep  Version 4.1  16-July-2021   
Page 24 of 47 
 STI testing, uring screening, and blood microsampling for those reporting PrEP use) are 
encouraged .  Biological specimen collection may be done in person during the study vi sit or via 
self-collection kits mailed to participants. For mailed self -collection, the biological specimens may 
be collected and returned at any point during the visit window. Participants , if they choose to do 
so, will be able to meet with research staff  via live, secure video chat, to answer questions about 
the at -home self -collection kit components and procedures. Particularly, study staff will be able to 
answer questions and go over results of rapid HIV test results if participants prefer to self -
admin ister a rapid test in addition to or in lieu of a lab processed HIV test. Rapid HIV test results 
will be confirmed with research staff via secure video chat, or by [CONTACT_77500] a photo of the test 
results to a secure online survey  hosted by [CONTACT_440731]. The active intervention period ends after [ADDRESS_1004563] access to their interv ention to which they 
were assi gned after month 6 .  
Participants can schedule and attend a 9 -month follow -up visit as early as 14 days prior to the 
calendar date that falls nine months after their enrollment date, and as late as 90 days after the 
calendar date that falls nine months after their enrollment d ate. Participants will return to the SRV 
at the 9 -month follow up for HIV , STI, and drug screen  testing, blood microsampling for those 
report PrEP uptake or use, as well as a final ACASI to measure sustained effects of the 
intervention . Of the biological s pecimen tests, only HIV testing is required, however the others 
(i.e. STI testing, uring screening, and blood microsampling for those reporting PrEP use) are 
encouraged . Biological specimen collection may be done in person during the study visit or via 
self-collection kits mailed to participants. For mailed self -collection, the biological specimens may 
be collected and returned at any point during the visit window.  Participants , if they choose to do 
so, will be able to meet with research staff via live, sec ure video chat, to answer questions about 
the at -home self -collection kit components and procedures. Particularly, study staff will be able to 
answer questions and go over results of rapid HIV test results if participants prefer to self -
administer a rapid test in addition to or in lieu of a lab processed HIV test. Rapid HIV test results 
will be confirmed with research staff via secure video chat, or by [CONTACT_77500] a photo of the test 
results to a secure online survey  hosted by [CONTACT_440731].

to be clinicians. A research assistant (RA) level position is sufficient to obtain informed consent, 
oversee administration of the brief survey , and assist with the focus groups as needed.  If a 
participant asks a question that the RA does n ot feel equipped to answer, the RA  will contact 
[CONTACT_735173] -up with 
the pa rticipant. SRV study staff and r esearch staff at Friends Research Institute and San Diego 
State University  will monitor for participant self - or other harm ideation or behaviors during the 
focus group that may require involvement from the clinical team at the SRV.  
All proposed study staff have participated in the required trainings in participation and conduct of 
studies that involve human subjects, and any future study staff will do so upon hiring. Training for 
all research staff includes (but is not li mited to) an overview of the study, study procedures and 
human subjects issues (informed consent process, confidentiality), a demonstration of all 
technology components, methods for establishing comfort with the sensitive issues, including 
discussion of se xual behaviors, that will likely arise in the course of the focus groups or 
assessments, review of the study instruments, their required elements and the inherent flexibility 
built into them, Human Subjects Protection, Good Clinical Practice, informed cons ent, quality 
management, confidentiality, and reporting of adverse events.

reason for discontinuing the study and paid the full compensation amount. Participants who 
discontinue study participation during the RCT will be asked to provide a reason for discontinuing 
the study and provided compensati on consistent with their participation up to that point.  
7.0 DATA COLLECTION AND SITE MONITORING  
7.1 Development of Protocol and Case Report Forms  
The Management Core, in collaboration with the Protocol Team, is responsible for the 
development of this prot ocol as well as the Case Report Forms (CRFs) needed to collect the 
information required to implement this protocol.  
7.2 Data Records  
Participant -related study information will be identified through a study  ID number ( SID) and 
participant code comprised of the first initial of the participant’s first name [CONTACT_735194], audio files, tra nscripts, and survey data files. Participant 
names or other personally  identifying information will not be used on any study documents and 
should be redacted from focus group transcripts. All study -related information will be kept in 
double -locked, limited access areas at each study site. Participant names and their SID and 
participant code  will be stored in the SMART  system which is separate  from other study 
inform ation, and is accessible only to designated study staff, iTech site monitors, and 
representatives from the NICHD.  Original source documents for individual participants will be 
maintained at the respective SRV and will be accessible only to the study staff.  Data from original 
source documents will be transcribed on CRFs as applicable.

 7.3  Data Collection  
7.3.1 Focus group data collection  
Focus group discussions will be transcribed verbatim from the digital audio -recording and de -
identified by [CONTACT_112509].  
Two independent researchers  will analyze the focus group data using the qualitative software 
program Dedoose (or equivalent software) to code, sort, search, and extract text to develop and 
explore emergent themes. To calculate  an inter-rater reliability score , each researcher  will 
independently develop themes to compi[INVESTIGATOR_735148] a preliminary codebook that will be refined during 
multiple  iterations of transcript review. After which notes, themes, and subthemes will be 
compare d and review ed, and inconsistencies  will be reconciled . 
 
7.3.[ADDRESS_1004567],  a secure content management platform , 
and/or available electronic in DFexplore .  
 
7.3.[ADDRESS_1004568]  will remain confidential; no personal identifying information will be 
collected. The participant’s unique SID# will be used in order  to link the survey information entered  
to the participant’s CRF data.   
Photos of participant HIV rapid test results uploaded into Alchemer. The results will  be made  
available  by [CONTACT_735176] a site -specific live “portal” download CSV spreadsheet that is 
accessible through a password protected link that Emory  provide s to each SRVs.  The password 
protected C SV file download will have the participant’s study  ID and a url link to the photo.  
 
7.3.[ADDRESS_1004569] the option to use 
VSee in several formats:  face -to-face video chat, video  chat in which they can see the coach  but 
the coach  cannot see them, audio chat only, or a text based conversation . VSee is compatible on 
PCs, tablets, and smartphones. Unlike other video -chat platforms (e.g. , Skype), VSee is HIPAA -
compliant. VSee includes  the following functions to protect users:  
ATN 160 – TechStep  Version 4.1  16-July-2021   
Page 28 of 47 
 End-to-end encryption without a man -in-the-middle listener .  In WebEx, Vidyo , Tandberg, and 
Polycom architectures, media is sent to a server (also called a video relay or MCU). Although 
encryption is applied from the user’s computer to these servers, the servers still have full access 
to the user’s media. In contrast, VSee uses en d-to-end encryption where no server, including 
VSee servers, has the decryption key. VSee uses public/private RSA keys to exchange a [ADDRESS_1004570] the AES session key. VSee uses 
FIPS 140 -2 certified 256-bit AES encryption.  
One port .  VSee uses a single port for call signaling and media. The VSee protocol is structured 
so that only the outgoing port needs to be open because return traffic is always structured as 
responses to outgoing traffic. This all ows administrators to set a policy where if users inside their 
network are using VSee, then their firewall lets VSee traffic securely cross the firewall; however, 
if users inside their firewall stop using VSee, then the firewall will block external port sc ans.  
Automatic HTTP/SSL tunneling .  VSee prefers to use UDP since it allows higher performance 
video. However, if the firewall does not allow UDP, VSee will automatically switch to HTTP/SSL 
tunneling.  
Cloud Control .  VSee's cloud solution allows enterpri ses to maintain central control of their 
security policies to a large number of end points even though the service is hosted by [CONTACT_112504]. It 
does this by [CONTACT_112505], where the 
policies are controlled. The cloud servers determine whether any of these security policies should 
be applied and enforces them as the VSee client. This allows us to set our own security settings 
and to record the sessions.  
No-install client .  Video conferencing software clients tend to be large and to leave a big footprint 
on the user’s system. Almost all of them require administrator permissions to install. Once the 
client software gains administrator permissions, they can severely compromise computer security. 
VSee is a lightwe ight client that does not require administrator permissions or installation.  
VSee offers the HIPAA -required Business Associate Agreement (BAA) where VSee agrees to be 
responsible for keepi[INVESTIGATOR_735149]. In this study, the iTech Technology core will enter into a BAA with 
VSee, and this will be extended to cover the proposed activities. The VSee sessions will include 
identifying information (e.g. images of the participant , voice recordings). All identifying information 
will be stripped from the recorded VSee sessions before they are sent to the analysis team for 
content analysis.  
 
7.3.[ADDRESS_1004571] face -to-face video chat, video chat in which 
they can see the study staff , but the study staff  cannot see them, or audio chat only. Zoom is 
compatible on PCs, tablets,  and smartphones; as well as maintains the option to conduct an audio 
conference without the video component. Emory University has entered into a BAA with Zoom, 
where Zoom agrees to be responsible for keepi[INVESTIGATOR_735150] (PHI).  
End-to-end encryption . Zoom encrypts all presentation content at the application layer using the 
Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) 256 -bit algorithm. Zoom end -to-end (E2E) chat encryption 
allows for a secured  communication where only the intended recipi[INVESTIGATOR_735151]. Zoom uses public and private keys to encrypt the chat session with Advance Encryption 
Standard (AES256), and session keys are generated with device unique hardware ID to avoid 
ATN 160 – TechStep  Version 4.1  16-July-2021   
Page 29 of 47 
 data being read from other devices. This ensures that the session cannot be eavesdropped or 
tampered with.  
Cloud Control Infrastructure . A distributed network of low -latency multimedia routers (software) 
resides on Zoom’s communications infrastructure. With  these low -latency multimedia routers, all 
session data originating from the host’s device and arriving at the participants’ devices is 
dynamically switched — never stored persistently through the Zoom communications 
infrastructure. Zoom’s communications i nfrastructure for real -time video, audio, and data 
communications resides on Zoom dedicated servers, which are housed in SSAE 16 SOC2 
compliant datacenters on opposite sides of the US. Zoom sessions are completely temporary and 
operate analogously to the p opular mobile conversation over the public mobile network. In 
addition to unique security beneﬁts, Zoom’s communications infrastructure also enables an 
extremely scalable and highly available meeting infrastructure unrestricted by [CONTACT_735177].  
The Zoom client communicates with the multimedia router to establish a reliable and secure 
connection. At the time of instantiation, the Zoom client will determine the best method for 
communication, attempting to connect automatically usin g udp and tcp port 8801, 8802 and 8804 
or HTTPS (port 443/TLS).  
The Zoom sessions will contain identifying information, as in VSee  above, but this information will 
be stripped form the recorded Zoom sessions before they are sent to the analysis team for content 
analysis.  
 
7.3.7  Qualtrics  Platform Description  
Qualtrics may be used for study surveys and online informed consent/assent  forms.  
Qualtrics uses Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption (also known as Hypertext Transfer 
Protocol Secure (HTTPS)) for all transmitted data.   Survey data are protected with passwords 
and HTTPS referrer checking.   The data is hosted by [CONTACT_735178] (SSAE) -16 Service Organization Control (SOC) II 
certified.   All data at rest are encrypted, and data on deprecated hard drives are destroyed by 
U.S. Department of Defense methods and delivered to a third -party data destruction service.  
Qualtrics deploys the general requirements set forth by [CONTACT_735179] (FISMA) of 2002.   They meet or exceed the minimum 
requirements as outli ned in Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) Publication 200.  
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Statement: With some restrictions, 
Qualtrics may be designated as a Business Associate when the Qualtrics BA Agreement is si gned 
with a Covered Entity —those organizations that are required to comply with HIPAA privacy 
rules.   All client data are considered confidential, and treated as such.  
Related to HIPAA, Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HI TECH) 
are updated assessment rules to ensure that data are properly protected and best security 
practices are followed.   By [CONTACT_121852], Qualtrics ensures the highest 
protection and testing as per HITECH requirements.  
 
ATN 160 – TechStep  Version 4.[ADDRESS_1004572] 
key study visit data (e.g., enrollment and randomization assignment), study milestones such as 
completion or discontinuation, study laboratory results, and adverse events (AE ). AC staff will 
work with study investigators and the MC to develop and design the CRFs. During study conduct, 
the SRVs will maintain the CRFs in secured locations, and transmit CRF data to the AC either 
electronically using DFexplore or by [CONTACT_735180]. DFexplore 
and its DFdiscover platform is a leading multi -site database environment for HIV RCT that can 
receive and transcribe CRF data via scanned PDFs, or allow for direct electronic data entry. It 
provides for monitoring f orm completion and data quality, and a system for data querying and 
resolution with SRVs, while maintaining an audit trail. The AC uses DFexplore for MSM studies 
and RCTs and data is maintained by [CONTACT_112508]/net on a cloud -based server with 
Microsoft Azure.  
 
7.4.2  Audio Data  
Audio -recoded  data for the focus groups  will initially be stored as a digital file on a secure 
encrypted server. All focus group discussion  may also be recorded using a back -up digital audio 
recorder. All audio files will be kept confidential and stored in a locked/limited access folder on 
secured servers, which is only accessible to designated study staff. All members of the research 
team wi ll be trained in confidentialit y. Focus group discussions will be transcribed verbatim from 
the digital audio -recording and de -identified by [CONTACT_112509]. After 
transcripts are verified by [CONTACT_735181] , audio files will 
be destroyed.  
All survey  data will only be identified with a unique study number and stored on a secure encrypted 
server by [CONTACT_112511]. Only SRV research staff, the AC team, and the research team at Friends 
Research Institute , San Diego State University  and the University of Minnesota will have access 
to the data.  
eCoaching sessions will be audio recorderd for fidelity checks and supervision.  
 
7.4.[ADDRESS_1004573] Database  
The study will use a HIPAA -compliant web -based platform e ntitled Study Management and 
Retention Toolkit (SMART), which is a SaaS (Software as a Service) based mobile application 
aiding studies with various aspects of participant recruitment, study implementation, and 
retention. The application has the ability to  securely manage participant information across 
multiple studies and customers simultaneously, stratifying participant information by [CONTACT_287539]. SMART includes an admin web portal and a participant facing mobile app (optional), which 
allows for secure  messaging, study calendar management, self -scheduling by [CONTACT_4317], 
secure photo uploads, and longitudinal tracking of participants from screening to study 
completion. The ability to designate specific roles to all SMART users allows for greater contro l 
around permissions and accessibility to participant information. Users can even be limited to a 
reporting only role, which allows for study oversight through real time aggregate reporting, but no 
ATN 160 – TechStep  Version 4.1  16-July-2021   
Page 31 of 47 
 access to PHI. SMART is a licensed service of the Center f or AIDS Research (CFAR) at Emory 
University, Prevention Science Core. Utilization of the mobile app is optional and the admin web 
portal will fully function without it.  
 
The following information outlines the security of the three SMART components: (1) the  admin 
web portal, (2) the participant app, and (3) a web service that acts as a liaison between the mobile 
app and the study database.  
 
Admin Web Portal . The admin web portal is a web -based application developed using Microsoft 
.NET technologies. It uses SQL server as backend database. The application requires two servers 
to host: (1) Web server [Windows server with IIS] and (2) SQL server [Standard or Enterprise 
version]. Both these servers are to be placed behind a firewall. Web server will have a public  IP 
to access the server using VPN. SSL certificate is to be installed on the web server. The admin 
website will be rendered over SSL (https).  
 
The application uses form authentication (no integrated authentication such as AD). All passwords 
are stored enc rypted within the database. System will also be using database level encryption, 
which will prevent any copying of information from one database to another. Web application also 
uses an automatic logout feature after a certain period of inactivity. By [CONTACT_735182], the inactivity 
duration is set to three minutes.  
 
Study staff can only first gain access to the admin web portal if granted by a study or site 
administrator. Their assigned user role will determine their permissions to perform different 
actions and ev en view PHI. Email notifications are sent from the system (without the need to login) 
when: (1) a staff member requests to reset their password, (2) role assignments to a study are 
made, (3) an event/visit staff are scheduled to work is nearing, (4) a new task is assigned to a 
staff member, or (5) they are designated as a staff member to receive alerts of positive test results. 
All participant communications are performed using secure messaging through the message 
center (inbox) implementation within the mo bile app. If the mobile app is not utilized by a study, 
communications are sent as standard email or text messages to participants.  
 
SMART Mobile App . The mobile app, developed natively for iOS and Android platforms and 
available for free in the App Store and Google Play Store, is an optional feature the study can 
utilize for self -scheduling, communication, photo uploads, and updating contact [CONTACT_3031]. The 
study will indicate during the initial setup within the admin web portal whether the participant 
mobile app is utilized or not. If the app is utilized, participants will receive download instructions 
after their information is entered into the admin web portal. Only participants listed in an active 
study who validate their email or phone number against the contact [CONTACT_735183]. For validation, the app uses both traditional form 
authentication as well as social login (Facebook and Google). The social login feature will only 
work if the ema il associated with either social account matches the contact [CONTACT_374034]. The app does not request anything other than basic information from these 
authentication services. Participants cannot “remember” their password on the mo bile device for 
automatic logins to ensure privacy. All participant data and activity status is maintained within a 
secure and encrypted SQL Server database. To create the connection between the admin web 
portal and the mobile app, each participant is assi gned a unique ID within the application, which 
is associated with their login credentials. When a participant has been successfully authenticated 
through the mobile app, the admin web portal will send their specific information to their phone 
through the e stablished secure session (web APIs using SSL). The app will not store the 
information presented locally on the phone. Local data storage is used only for storing some 
minimal non -PHI information, such as app settings. The mobile app implements an automati c 
ATN 160 – TechStep  Version 4.[ADDRESS_1004574] authentication will be required again.  
 
The mobile app has push notifications that are primarily used for reminders and notifications of 
new messages. Push notifications displayed on the participant’s phone will be generic in nature 
and not contain any PHI. Reminders and notifications within the mobile app inbox will also be 
generic in nature, with any mes sage containing sensitive information requiring a pin, established 
during registration as a secondary authentication, to open within the mobile app. Firebase cloud 
messaging service is used as a communication channel for these notifications. No PHI is pass ed 
through Firebase. Push notifications are customizable in the study setup, and samples of system 
notifications include: “You have a new message in your inbox,” “You have an upcoming event for 
March 7, 2018,” and “You have a pending task.”  
 
Web Service . A web service will also be hosted on the web server. This service is used by [CONTACT_287542]. The service will utilize secure socket layer (SSL) for 
communication.  
 
7.[ADDRESS_1004575] adhere to the Code  of Federal Regulations (CFR) to 
protect research participants and produ ce reliable study information. Sites participating in 
research sponsored by [CONTACT_112516] (QA) plan tha t will 
identify problems and correct errors in research study records.  
7.[ADDRESS_1004576] Availability  
Site monitors from the MC and AC will visit participating study sites to review a selected portion 
of the individual participant records, including assent/consent forms, CRFs , and supporting source 
documentation to ensure the protection of study subjects, compliance with the protocol, and 
accuracy and completeness of records. Regulatory files, as required, will also be inspected to 
ensure that regulatory requirements are being followed.  
The site inve stigator will make study documents (e.g., assent/ consent forms, case report forms) 
readily available for inspection by [CONTACT_1036], the central IRB, the site monitors, the NICHD, the 
Office for Human Research Protection s (OHRP), or the sponsor’s designee for confirmation of 
the study data.  
 
8.0 PARTICIPANT MANAGEMENT  
 
8.1 Tracking Participants / Follow -up 
 
ATN 160 – TechStep  Version 4.[ADDRESS_1004577] as indicated at baseli ne (e.g. mail, alternate phone numbers, e -
mail, text message, social media contact [CONTACT_3031]), to contact [CONTACT_735184].   Additional  reminders  will be provided  on/after  the target  date as needed  to 
ensure  completion  of study  visit proce dures.   Participants  will be asked whether or not messages 
can be left for each of the phone numbers that they provide.  They will be informed that messages 
will not contain any information regarding the nature of the project.   
 
8.2 Compensation  
The method and amount of compensation will be determined separately by [CONTACT_25733], listed in the 
site’s informed consent/assent form, and approved by [CONTACT_565122] (the UNC -CH IRB).  RCT 
participants will be compensated at each of their appointments at the SRV, including the 
enrollment/baseline visit and each of the 3 -, 6-, and 9 -month assessment points.  
8.3 Intervening on “Social Harms"  
We identified the following 3 items as possible risks to subjects for the overall study period and 
described how we plan on addressing those risks:  
1. Protecting against others finding o ut about their gender  identity  during focus groups . 
Participants will be alerted to this given that the focus groups are in person . The 
description of the purpose of the study will clearly state that the study is designed to 
promote face -to-face discussion with other trans YYA, and we will recommend that 
persons who are highly uncomfortable with such exchanges may be better served by [CONTACT_735185]. Once enrolled, we also minimize this risk of identification to 
participants by [CONTACT_735186] a pseudonym  that do not contain 
personally identifying information . Additionally, we will establish “group rules” that in clude 
requesting that no information about the identity of participants or what is said in the focus 
group is shared outside of the focus group.  Although we cannot guarantee their anonymity, 
we will take appropriate safeguards to minimize this risk.  
2. Protecting against discomfort in answering personal questions during the focus group 
discussions . This risk is similar to # [ADDRESS_1004578] it. Thus, we intend to fully inform participants of the purpose and  nature of 
the study prior to their participation. Participants are informed that they are free not to 
answer questions, and they may stop participation at any time. Since a “ decline to answer ” 
option is provided to the survey completed just before the foc us group,  there is a constant 
reminder of their participant rights throughout the study. Thus, w e believe the risk to 
participants is minimal and we have adequately anticipated and set into place protocols to 
address potential risks that may arise.  
3. Protect ing against concerns about the security of their data  during focus groups and RCT . 
Well-established security processe s will be followed, that include  the following:  
• Participants’ identifying information is housed in a separate cloud -based password -
protected study management platform, SMART, which is separate from survey data 
and other collected outcome data. Only authorized study staff will be granted access 
ATN 160 – TechStep  Version 4.[ADDRESS_1004579] atform through requests initially made to the Analytic Core at Emory University, 
or subsequently through the designated study coordinator. SMART regulates staff 
permissions to view participant information based on assigned user roles, which also 
stratifies  participant data by [CONTACT_3725]/location, such that staff from other sites will not be 
able to view participant data except from their site/location. Study staff will not be able 
to download participant data from the cloud -based platform. Only designated analyst s 
at the Analytic Core at Emory University will have access to data downloads from 
SMART for reporting purposes.   
• At the end of the study, the identifying information (participants’ names and contact 
[CONTACT_3031]) is destroyed. The original data records wi ll be archived for  a minimum of  
3 years following the conclusion of the study  or longer if institutional requirements 
dictate , and three copi[INVESTIGATOR_112468] -identified dataset will be maintained (a working one 
and two archived at different sites).  
• All project  staff will be required to complete the NIH online training in research ethics. 
Further training and supervision will focus research staff on confidentiality concerns 
both during and after the study. The project coordinator in conjunction with the Protocol  
Chairs  are responsible for ensuring that all research staff involved in this study 
document their NIH training.  
There are two risks associated with receiving the WebApp:  
1. Protecting against going to the site by [CONTACT_86966] . We have a secure site (https:) with  an 
introductory page clearly specifying the nature of the study. Sensitive survey or 
intervention content is protected behind screening questions and a username/password, 
and therefore in the opening study webpage, we could not think of anything that would be 
deemed offensive by [CONTACT_112519]. In this way, we have 
minimized the risk to a level that is negligible.  
 
2. Protecting against hostile interactions and inaccurate information from one participant to 
another . Participants will be informed during the onboarding  process of the “group rules” 
regarding interactions with one anoth er (e.g., “Honesty is important;  however, hostile or 
abusive language will not be tolerated and may be grounds for immediate removal from 
the study”). These “rules” will also be available with a link on all intervention web pages 
for review by [CONTACT_112522]. The project coordinator will manually review an 
automated compi[INVESTIGATOR_735152] a daily basis to flag ho stile 
interactions and inaccurate information. Hostile interactions between participants will be 
handled by, first, reminding the participants in the interaction of the “group rules” regarding 
appropriate interactions. If the hostility continues, the offen ding participants will be given 
a warning that the continued hostility will result in withdrawal from the study if it continues. 
On the third offense,  the participant may be  withdrawn from the study  after discussion of 
the offense . Text containing hostile exchanges will be removed from the study website 
and unavailable to view. In cases in which inaccurate information is found, project staff be 
guided by [CONTACT_225524] a comment that provides accurate information on 
the topic. In extreme cases,  the Protocol Chair s or SRV Site PIs may decide to withdraw 
a participant before the third offense.  We will ensure all clinic sites have a clear clinical 
protocol to address major issues that may come up at study visits or in online interactions. 
The major  issues addressed in the procotol will be suicidal ideation, homicidality or violent 
ideation, emotional and cognitive disregulation, violent/aggressive or disruptive behavior, 
and intoxication. If research staff see concerning comments or messages online from 
participants regarding self -harm or harm of others, they will contact [CONTACT_735187].  
ATN 160 – TechStep  Version 4.[ADDRESS_1004580] specific policies governing the treatment of human subjects. These policies specify 
that medical and psychological a ssistance will be available in the immediate environment in the 
event a participant should experience any adverse reactions resulting from study procedures.  
While participants will be informed that they may refuse to answer any question at any time, 
respo nses or reactions to certain questions may indicate distress on the part of the participants.  
If at any time during the study, a participant divulges that he or she is at risk for harm, including 
but not limited to being abused or experiencing violence, i f harm is suspected or likely, or if the 
participant states he or she is suicidal/homicidal, measures will be taken to ensure his or her 
safety. Reporting will be done as appropriate to the situation and the legal statutes, including 
reporting to child pro tection agencies or other appropriate agencies , and referrals will be provided 
to appropriate support, counseling , or treatment resources.  
See section 11.3.[ADDRESS_1004581] of the participant. The participant will be informed 
of this withdrawa l and explained the rationale. Withdrawal will be documented in the study tracking 
system.  If a participant is withdrawn due to seroconversion, they will be offered referrals and 
linkages as necessary, and may be referred to an ATN study for HIV+ participa nts. 
 
Participants will be prematurely discontinued from the study if any of the following occurs:  
• The participant  withdraws consent/assent  
• The participant is unwilling or unable to comply with study procedures  
• The participant fails to return or confirm HIV negative test results with research staff within 
90 days of their enrollment visit  
• The participant returns a HIV positive test result at the 3 - or 6-month follow -up time point.  
• The participant seroconverts  
• The Protocol Chairs or Site PIs  believe that ongoing participation may cause harm to the 
participant or study staff  
• The Protocol Cha irs of Site PI  [INVESTIGATOR_735153] (or iTech, or other administrative entity) ; 
• The study is cancelled for other administrative reasons;    
• Death of the participant  
 
Participants may end their participation in the study at any time. No further data collection will 
occur from the date the decision is made to permanently discontinue the subject from the study. 
Participants who experience distress during the study while i n the SRV clinic will be offered 
counseling on site. Participants who experience distress during the study and do not come to the 
SRV clinic for a visit will be provided a list of community referrals via phone or e -mail. Any 
unexpected adverse events that meet the unanticipated problem (UP) reporting criteria will be 
immediately reported to the UNC -CH IRB and the respective sites’ IRBs if applicable. The Study 
Stop CRF will be completed at this time.  
ATN 160 – TechStep  Version 4.[ADDRESS_1004582] follow their own IRB’s procedure for reporting and managing 
untoward effects.  
There are three types of untoward effects to be identified:  (1) those related to the participant, (2) 
those related to the s tudy staff, and (3) those related to the neighborhood/community  (if 
applicable).  
First, the study will catalogue any untoward effect related to the participant. Reporting is required 
for occurrences including social harms, psychological distress , and serio us life-threatening  events 
such as suicide attempts. These may be immediately apparent to the study staff, such as the 
participant’s emotional upset state requiring referral for counseling; or they may be delayed and 
reported later to study staff, such as physical harm to an individual for having participated in the 
study. Study staff will notify the iTech team of these untoward effects using the iTech QNS 
accessible through the iTech website (www.iTechnetwork.org ) within [ADDRESS_1004583] effects/adverse events/unan ticipated problems will also need to be reported to the 
UNC IRB if they meet all three of the following criteria:  
“Unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others” (UPI[INVESTIGATOR_9961]) refers to any incident, 
experience, or outcome that:  
1) is unexpected (i n terms of nature, severity, or frequency) given (a) the research 
procedures that are described in the protocol -related documents, such as the IRB -
approved research protocol and informed consent document; and (b) the 
characteristics of the subject populati on being studied;  
2) is related or possibly related to a subject’s participation in the research; and  
3) suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm 
(including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previ ously 
known or recognized.  
Events that meet the criteria for an UPI[INVESTIGATOR_735154] (1) week of the investigator becoming aware of the event.  
Any other events that meet the criteria for a UPI[INVESTIGATOR_29737] 
(2) weeks of the investigator becoming aware of the problem.

 If the report cannot be completed in its entirety within the required time period, a preliminary report 
should be submitted. The report should be amended once the event is resolved and/or more 
information becomes available.  
10.0 STATISTICAL/ ANALYTIC CONSIDERATIONS  
10.[ADDRESS_1004584] eight  focus groups with up to 10 trans YYA (one group with yout h 15-20 years 
old and one group with young adults 21-24 year s old) at 4 SRVs (Houston, Los Angeles,  New 
York, and Philadelphia). Focus groups in Houston and Los Angeles will be used to obtain  
information specific to the Web App. Topi[INVESTIGATOR_735155] : 1) challenges 
to obtaining culturally appropriate and comprehensive sexual health and other health services ; 2) 
feedback from trans YYA about the “look and feel” and content of the original TWM and YouTHrive 
intervention s; 3) suggestions for adapting the intervention for trans YYA similar to themselves. 
Focus groups in [LOCATION_001] and Philadelphia will be u sed to obtain information specific t o the text 
messaging intervention. Topi[INVESTIGATOR_735156] : 1) feedback from the t rans 
YYA about the adaptation of the Text Me, Girl!  text-message library for HIV -positive young trans 
women to high-risk trans feminine, trans masculine,  and gender non -conforming HIV-negative 
YYA; 2) specific editing of text messages for content that is culturally appropriate and relevant to 
HIV-negative t rans YYA; 3) suggestions on content and appropriateness of text messages related 
to trans-specific se xual health ; 4) suggestions on content and appropriateness of text messages 
related to biobehavioral HIV prevention strategies (e.g., PEP/PrEP).  Focus groups (as opposed 
to in-depth quantitative interviews) were chosen to gain fee dback in these areas becau se this  
setting will allow participants to explore together the ways in which the TechStep  intervention 
meets their needs and how the intervention can be adapted to be community appropriate.   
 
10.[ADDRESS_1004585] 8  focus groups, targeting youth  (ages 15-20) and young adults  (ages 21-24) at [ADDRESS_1004586] Power Considerations  
We performed extensive Monte Carlo simulations to assess the power for our primary analysis. 
We examined scenarios involving different dropout rates (5 -15%), different relative efficacies of 
first-line (text or app) interventions relative to the eCoaching intervention, and different levels of 
strength of predictive covariates to be included in the analysis. Across a wide range of scenarios, 
we determined that we will have >80% power to detect a clinically meaningful effect, defined as 
an average decrease of  at least 1.5 risky sexual encounters over the course of the study.  
ATN 160 – TechStep  Version 4.[ADDRESS_1004587] with 
theme identification, coding textual data, and describing relationships among codes (via code co -
occurrence and memoing functions).  Following established focus group analysis guidelines , we 
will create a codebook of a priori and emergent themes including operational definitions of all 
codes and sample quotations to illustrate how to apply each code. Two study team members will 
then use the codebook to independently code the compi[INVESTIGATOR_735157] a third team 
member will review these sections of coded data and resolve discrepancies. We will draw a 
random sample of 20 instances for the coders to begin with and calculate an inter -rater reliability 
score based on their code assignments . If this score is <95% , we will refine the codebook 
definitions and retrain the coders. Coders will then complete the coding of the remaining instances 
and we will calculate an inter -rater reliability score. Discrepancies will then be reviewed and 
resolve d by [CONTACT_5051].  Coding and anal ytic activities will be discussed during weekly 
team meetings.  
 
10.3.[ADDRESS_1004588]  
Outcomes understudy include rates of condomless anal and vaginal sex, number of exchange 
partners, reports of sex while feeling t he effects of stimulants (i.e. methamphetamine, powder 
cocaine, crack cocaine) or after binge drinking (5+ drinks at one time), self -report and confirmed 
STI diagnoses, and PrEP adherence measured through self -report and verified by [CONTACT_735188] . We will analyze both the primary and secondary questions in the RCT using 
longitudinal targeted minimimum loss -based estimation (LTMLE).[ADDRESS_1004589] 2 audio recorders at each focus group. In ad dition, written notes the focus 
group discussion will be obtained.  
ATN 160 – TechStep  Version 4.[ADDRESS_1004590], as mentioned in Section 10.3.2, the LTMLE approach used in the primary analysis 
will account for missing data.  
 
11.0 HUMAN SUBJECTS  
This study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, ICH Good Clinical Practice  (GCP)  
guidelines, and 45 CFR Part 46.  
11.1 Participants’ Confidentiality  
All laboratory specimens, questionnaires, evaluation forms, reports, transcripts, and other records 
will be identified by a coded number only, to maintain participant confidentiality. All records with 
personally  identifying information will be kept in a locked  file cabinet in a limited secure access 
area at each SRV site , or in a secure limited access study database . All computer entry and 
networking programs will be done with coded numbers only. Clinical information will not be 
released without written permission of the participant, except as necessary for monitoring by [CONTACT_735189].  
Every effort will be made to ensure that study participants are protected from risks. The main risk 
specific to the role of the AC is breach of confidentiality.  
Breach of Confidentiality:  A potential risk to participants is violation of confidentiality. We will take 
the utmost caution to protect the confidentiality of all responses. We will minimize this risk by 
[CONTACT_349329].  
Participants may be concerned about the security of their data, particularly since it is collected 
and stored electronically. The AC has significant experience developi[INVESTIGATOR_735158] -based studies, and we will take a variety of steps to ensure participant security, 
including using a dedicated server behind a firewall, encryption of data, separation of identifiers 
from responses, and password -protected access to data. Therefore, we believe that this risk will 
be minimal. All of the apps  and websites included in the iTech have features to ensure security 
and privacy.  
11.2 Certificate of Confidentiality  
This research specifically targets a vulnerable population, trans YYA between the  ages  of 15-24. 
We will take every available step to min imize the risk of identifying/linking data being subpoenaed, 
stolen, or inadvertently released. First, the iTech has obtained  a Certificate of Confidentiality from 
the NIH. Second, all research staff members are required to complete ethical clearance 
certification regarding protection of human subjects through their relevant IRBs. Third, all studies 
will have documented procedures to safeguard against the risk of the linking information being 
stolen by [CONTACT_9377][INVESTIGATOR_735159] 
(http://citiprogram.org ) will have access.   
Per Section [ADDRESS_1004591]  as implemented in the 2017 NIH Certificates of 
Confidentiality Po licy, all ongoing or new research funded by [CONTACT_119185] 13, 2016 that 
is collecting or using identifiable, sensitive information is automatically issued a CoC.   
As noted on the NIH website (http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/COC/faqs.htm#187), a Ce rtificate 
ATN 160 – TechStep  Version 4.1  16-July-2021   
Page 40 of 47 
 of Confidentiality will help the research team “...avoid compelled ‘involuntary disclosure’ (e.g., 
subpoenas) of names and other identifying information about any individual who participates as 
a research subject (i.e., about whom the investigato r maintains identifying information) during any 
time the Certificate is in effect.”  
11.3 Risks and Benefits  
11.3.1  Risks  
Risks to participants in this research study may include:   
Potential participants or participants enrolled in the study may have conc erns about others finding 
out about their gender identity  or other personal behavior (e.g., sexual behavior or substance 
use). We anticipate that the likelihood of this occurring is high for those randomized into the 
App+Step arm given that a major feature  of the WebApp  is for participants to network with one 
another and that eligibility for enrollment in the study requ ires participants to be a trans youth  or 
young adult . We anticipate that the likelihood of this occurring is high during the focus groups as  
well, since they will be meeting in -person with other trans YYA for the focus groups . Subjects will 
be informed of the inclusion criteria and general questions that will be asked during focus groups 
during the recruitment period. Since subjects will be recruited directly within SRVs , they will have 
the opportunity to discuss with staff wh ether they feel com fortable being a part of such 
discussions. Clear consent procedures will also give opportunities for subjects to withdraw if they 
no longer feel comfortable participating in focus group discussions. For those in the RCT, subjects 
will be  informed during the consent process of the basic features of the WebApp intervention and 
those who are not comfortable interacting with other trans YYA will be encouraged to not 
participate in the study.  
To minimize the risk of participants feeling uncom fortable about answering personal questions, 
we will provide an option for online  methods for screening . For assessments, we will use ACASI 
methods for the study's surveys. In ACASI, participants read and hear aloud survey questions on 
a computer and use a  combination of mouse click and keyboard/touchscreen entry to input the 
answers themselves. Study staff may be available to assist participants with questions or 
technical difficulties on the online screener of the ACASI. Participants will also be able to refuse 
to answer any question that makes them uncomfortable.  
Participants in the focus groups will be told of “group rules” at the beginning of the focus group, 
which includes asking them to not share the identities of attendees or content shared during t he 
focus group.  
The measurements that are involved in this study require venipuncture to collect blood samples  
for syphilis testing . Syphilis is tested by [CONTACT_735190] a trained and certified 
phlebotomist . This procedure may cause local discomfort, bleeding, or bruising; rarely small clot 
or infection can occur at the blood draw site. This measurement should not be considered greater 
than minimal risk in and of itself given its routine use in general health care delivery.  
Urine samples will be provided to test for gonorrhea, Chlamydia, and current drug use and will be 
collected under monitored conditions (i.e., using an FDA approved temperature strip to verify the 
specimen integrity).  Pharyngeal swabs are t aken from the back of the throat to test for gonorrhea 
and Chlamydia and participants self -administer rectal swabs for gonorrhea and Chlamydia.   
Trained and certified research assistants will perform dried blood spot extraction. The procedure 
will only re quire a finger prick to extract a small amount of blood, and threfore the risk of infection 
or bruising is small. If needed, clinical staff will be on site to assist with any medical problems that 
may arise from this procedure.  
ATN 160 – TechStep  Version 4.1  16-July-2021   
Page 41 of 47 
 Participants randomized into  the App+Step arm may receive hostile communications or incorrect 
information from other participants during the course of the WebApp component . It is possible 
that some participants may respond aggressively or with hostility to other participants. Likewis e, 
although well -intended, participants may provide inaccurate information about adherence or its 
risk factors to other participants by [CONTACT_112531]/social 
networking wall. The WebApp  intervention will include  a clear sec tion on Community Guidelines 
and will be monitored daily by [CONTACT_3647]. Users have the option to “flag” objectionable content. 
We have protocols in place  for addressing hostile interaction in the site up to and including 
termination of participation i n the study.  
Some participants in the Text+Step  arm may not want others to see that they are getting 
messages related to sexual health or their gender identity. Participants will be given assistance 
with strategies for minimizing unauthorized access to their phone . Participants will be shown how 
to lock their phone,  how to hide messages on the locked screen, establish and use a pin code to 
password protect their phone, and will be instructed to periodically delete the intervention text 
messages after the y have been read.  
To minimize risks to confidentiality  of focus group and RCT data , we will secure study data with 
all appropriate physical, electronic , and operational protections. Data will be stored in a physically 
secure environment. All data files wil l have encryption and strong password protection. Any 
identifiable data will either be stored on Emory University's secure servers or will be on fully 
encrypted laptops. Surveys and online eligibility screening will take place on an encrypted 
commercial su rvey website, Alchemer . This site has been used by [CONTACT_735191]. Access to data will 
be on a role -based standard; only those study staff who require access to e ach type of data to 
complete their study -related roles will be allowed access. All study staff will be trained in security 
and confidentiality procedures, and will sign a confidentiality agreement before receiving access 
to any participant data.  
We will also develop procedures to minimize indirect disclosure that a participant is participating 
in a HIV -prevention  research study, or a study that enrolls trans persons . For each mode of 
contact [CONTACT_3031], we will ask specifically whether anyone else p otentially has access to that 
mode of communication, and if it is acceptable to leave a non -specific message about 
participation in a health study. No study -related messages will ever mention HIV prevention or 
the nature of the research study. Additionally , all scripts for email, text message, and telephone 
contact [CONTACT_735192].  
We use SSL encryption for transfers of information online, and Alchemer  has a busi ness partner 
HIPAA agreement with Emory. Alchemer ’s servers are HIPAA compliant.  
The AC will use Dedoose software to perform all qualitative analyses. Dedoose  is a web -based 
application for organizing and analyzing textual, audio, and video data (qualitative) along with 
outstanding functionality for their integration with survey, test score, ratings, and demographic 
data (quantitative). Dedoose employs the high est levels of data encryption available for a web 
application in all data storage, back up, and transmission. Dedoose allows for project specific 
encryption feature. When using this feature, only [CONTACT_112542] or her designee will hold the 
additional en cryption key needed to be entered in order to view the project. This gives [CONTACT_112543] 
exclusive control over who can view the project under any circumstances.  
In addition to a Certificate of Confidentiality, we will protect participants in the following ways 
(which correspond to the potential risks described earlier ):  
1. Breach of confidentiality. We will take every precaution to minimize risks to study participants. 
ATN 160 – TechStep  Version 4.[ADDRESS_1004592] participants. Adverse events will be reported to the 
UNC -CH and Emory IRB s,  and SRV site -specific IRBs per each institution’s IRB reporting 
requirements using Adverse Event Reporting Forms created by [CONTACT_112534]. When possible, r eports 
will be sent within [ADDRESS_1004593] completed training and received certification in Human Subjects Research Protection (CITI 
Program) an d HIPAA regulations. They will continue to renew this training in compliance with 
institutional policies.  
11.3.[ADDRESS_1004594] 
technology -based intervention a rms (i.e., Text+Step and App+Step)  may provide participants with 
information and exercises that help them locate and access trans -relevant local resources, build 
motivation to start or restart PrEP, build peer social support, and identify and address individual, 
social, structural, and cultural barriers to HIV risk reduction . Participants in the control arm (i.e., 
Info) may gain basic knowledge about HIV and trans -specific health issues  and links to outside 
local resources. In either the experimental or control con dition s, the primary benefit is access to 
health information that may assist participants to improve access to culturally appropriate HIV risk 
reduction resources , increase quality of life , reduce high -risk sexual behaviors and lower the risk 
of acquiring HIV. Secondary benefits include positive feelings related to having assisted in the 
development of a novel technology -based  HIV risk reduction  intervention  for trans YYA.  
 
Compensation for participation is not considered a benefit, because we are simply reimbursing 
participants for their time, effort, and expenses.  
11.[ADDRESS_1004595] (IRB) Review and Informed Consent  
This protocol, the informed assent/ consent documents , and any subsequent modifications will be 
reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_112535]. The 
informed assent/ consent will describe the purpose of the study, the procedures to be followed, 
and the risks and benefits of participation.   
Consent/assent will be obtained to explain  the nature, signifi cance, and risks of the study.  Sample 
informed consent/assent forms are included in the IRB submission . 
11.5 Waiver of the Requirement for Parental Permission for Special Circumstances  
The site IRBs and the UNC IRB as the central IRB will be requested to grant a waiver of parental 
permission to participate in this research study for youth p articipants under  (not inclusive of)  the 
age of 18 .   
Under 45 CFR 46.408 (c), an IRB has the authority to waive parental permission if it determines 
that “a research protocol is designed for conditions or a subject population for which parental or 
guardian permission is not a reasonable requirement to protect the subjects” and “an appropriate 
mechanism for protecting the children who will participate as r esearch subjects is substituted” and 
“that the waiver is not inconsistent with Federal, State, or local law.”  
ATN 160 – TechStep  Version 4.[ADDRESS_1004596] for a waiver of the requirement for parental permission is requested for 2 reasons:   1) 
many trans youth would be reluctant to participa te in this study – which focuses on HIV prevention 
and PrEP uptake, adherence and persistence – if they are required to get parental permission; 
and 2) many of the trans youth in our study are likely to be gender and/or sexually fluid  or have 
an attraction  to persons of the same gender, but may not be out to their parents; requiring parental 
permission may place participants at risk for disclosing themselves as part of the LGBT 
community or being at risk for HIV infection . For these reasons, we believe it i s important to be 
granted a waiver for parental permission for this study population.  
11.[ADDRESS_1004597] of a signed 
consent form. A written consent form will be reviewed with each potential study participant and 
provided to each consenting one. This form desc ribes the purpose of the study, the procedures 
to be followed, and the risks and benefits of participation.  
Under 45 CFR §46.117 (c) (1) and (2), an IRB may waive the requirement for the investigator to 
obtain a singed informed consent for some or all of the subjects if it finds either:  (1) That the only 
record linking the subject and the research would be the consent document and the principal risk 
would be potential harm resulting from a breach of confidentiality. Each participant will be asked 
whether they want documentation linking them with the research, and the participant’s wishes will 
govern; or (2) that the research presents no more than minimal risk of harm to the participants 
and involve no procedures for which written consent is normally requir ed outside the research 
context.”  
The protocol team believes that both #1 and #2 applies to this study and, both combined, justify 
a waiver of written consent.   
11.6.2 For Eligibility Screening  
An online consent process for the eligibility screening is proposed. The introduction to the 
screening interview includes all the required elements for consent (45 CFR 46.116). No identifying 
information on volunteers is recorded during the online  screening until a participant is determined 
eligible (i.e., by [CONTACT_112536] “I do consent to be screened for eligibility ”). Therefore, there will be no 
identifying link of who agreed to be screened or not screened for the study . In addition, the 
screening presents minimal risk t o participants and involves no procedures that would require 
written consent outside of a research context. Under these conditions the IRB is authorized to 
modify the requirements to obtain a signed consent form for some or all subjects (45 CFR 46.117 
[c]).

Page 7 of 641. INTRODUCTION
1.1. Indication
Maraviroc, in combination with other antiretroviral medicinal products, is indicated for 
treatment-experienced adult patients infected with only CCR5-tropic HIV-1 detectable.
1.2. Background and Rationale
1.2.1. HIV Infection: Epi[INVESTIGATOR_455373] [ADDRESS_582079] destructive epi[INVESTIGATOR_455374]. As of December 2006, WHO/UNAIDS estimated that there were 39.5 million (34.1–47.1 million) people living with HIV/AIDS.  4.3 million (3.6–6.6 million) people were newly infected with the virus in 2005.
1
At present the only means of slowing HIV disease progression is the use of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), with the preferred initial regimen containing a three or four-drug regimens consisting of a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) or a ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor (PI/r) plus two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs).  Subsequent regimens frequently require more drugs, and become increasingly complex due to difficulty with adherence, tolerability due to adverse events and drug interactions with other required medications and the development of resistance to drugs in the failed regimen(s) or acquired resistant virus and class cross-resistance.
2-[ADDRESS_582080] not achieved treatment success with multiple treatment regimens due to drug resistance, side effects, incomplete adherence, or some combination of these factors.  Drugs that target novel steps of the HIV-1 life cycle are needed, as they do not share cross-resistance with currently available antiretroviral therapy. 
1.2.2. HIV Tropi[INVESTIGATOR_455375], early step in the replication cycle of HIV-1 is attachment to the CD4 receptor 
and to one of the chemokine coreceptors, CCR5 or CXCR4.  Generally, sexually transmitted HIV uses CCR5 exclusively during primary infection.  However, HIV that can use CXCR4 to enter CD4+ T lymphocyte cells can be detected in about 15% of treatment naïve patients and up to 50% of patients with late HIV disease or antiretroviral treatment experience in the developed world where Clade B virus predominates. In most cases the CXCR4-using HIV (X4 HIV) is present with CCR5-using virus (R5 HIV) as a single virus that can use either receptor (dual tropic) or a mixture of R5 and X4 HIV (mixed tropic).  Infections with HIV-1 that exclusively use CXCR4 to enter CD4+ T lymphocyte cells are rare, and represent approximately 1% of treatment naïve and approximately 2-4% of treatment-experienced patients.

A4001067Final Protocol Amendment #3, 29 November 2010
Page 8 of 641.2.3. CCR5 Antagonists
Maraviroc is a member of a new class of antiretroviral compounds known as small molecule 
CCR5 antagonists that block R5 HIV-1 entry into CD4+ T lymphocyte cells.  This group of molecules binds non-competitively to CCR5, causing a conformational change in the extracellular loops of CCR5 that renders it unrecognizable to wild type R5 HIV-1. 
1.2.4. Safety Concerns with CCR5 Antagonists
[IP_ADDRESS]. Hepatotoxicity
The development program for aplaviroc ([COMPANY_004] 873140), another CCR5 antagonist, was 
terminated due to severe drug-induced hepatotoxicity. For a third drug in this class, vicriviroc, no severe hepatic-related adverse events have been reported in the ongoing clinical trials to date.
The clinical data to date do not indicate that maraviroc causes abnormalities in hepatic 
function relative to placebo. No clinically relevant difference in severity or nature of hepatic dysfunction was observed among the two active and the placebo control treatment arms in the Phase 2b/[ADDRESS_582081]. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Infections and malignancies
When a CCR5 antagonist binds to the CCR5 receptor on the surface of CD4+ T lymphocyte, 
it blocks the natural function of the CCR5 molecule, which is primarily associated with retention of mononuclear cells in areas of inflammation and injury. Individuals who are born 
with two copi[INVESTIGATOR_1309] a mutant CCR5 gene (CCR5 Δ32) (ie, homozygous for CCR5 Δ32) and do 
not express CCR5 on the surface of their CD4+ T lymphocyte cells represent 1% of Caucasians of European descent. They appear to be essentially resistant to HIV-[ADDRESS_582082] apparently normal immune function.  Individuals with one normal CCR5 gene and 
one copy of the CCR5 Δ32 gene (ie, heterozygous for CCR5 Δ32), who comprise 10-15% of 
Caucasians of European descent, have a reduced concentration of CCR5 molecules on the 
surface of their CD4+ T lymphocyte cells and have essentially normal immune function. 
Relative to HIV-infected patients with two copi[INVESTIGATOR_455376], the CCR5 Δ32 
heterozygote individuals have delayed CD4+ T lymphocyte decline, delayed progression to AIDS, and longer survival once infected.
7-10However, whether blocking the CCR5 receptors 
in adults, who have had functioning CCR5 molecules throughout life, will have the same 
biologic effects as those observed in homozygotes or heterozygotes for CCR5 Δ32 is unclear. 
It is theoretically possible that blocking CCR5 molecules after a critical period in immune 
development could result in increased or decreased immune surveillance, leading to increased frequency or severity of infections or malignancies.

A4001067Final Protocol Amendment #3, [ADDRESS_582083] Nile Virus (WNV) is of particular scientific and clinical interest. Elderly 
and immunocompromised individuals have increased susceptibility to WNV, but genetic risk factors and immunologic control mechanisms have not been fully delineated. The monocyte and T lymphocyte chemokine receptor CCR5 have recently been identified as a key factor in viral clearance and survival in a mouse model of WNV encephalitis, in which the mechanism involved trafficking of leukocytes into the infected brain. Consistent with this, WNV induces expression of CCR5 ligands in WNV-infected mouse brain.  To test whether this receptor is 
also protective in man, Glass and colleagues determined the frequency of CCR5Δ32, in two 
independent cohorts of patients, one from Arizona and the other from Colorado, who had 
laboratory-confirmed, symptomatic WNV infection.
11The distribution of CCR5Δ32in a 
control population of healthy [LOCATION_002] Caucasian random blood donors was in
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and CCR5Δ32 homozygotes represented 1.0% of the total 
group (n = 1,318). In contrast, CCR5Δ32 homozygotes represented 4.2% of Caucasians in 
the Arizona cohort (odds ratios [OR] = 4.4 [95% confidence interval [CI], 1.6–11.8], P=0.0013) and 8.3% of Caucasians in the Colorado cohort (OR = 9.1 [95% CI, 3.4–24.8], 
P <0.0001). CCR5Δ32 homozygosity was significantly associated with fatal outcome in the 
Arizona cohort (OR = 13.2 [95% CI, 1.9–89.9], P = 0.03). These authors concluded that
CCR5 mediates resistance to symptomatic WNV infection.  These findings may have important implications for the effect of CCR5-blocking agents on the incidence and severity of WNV infection.
On March 3, 2006 Schering-Plough announced that five cases of malignancy (four cases of 
lymphoma and one case of gastric adenocarcinoma) had been reported in 118 heavily pretreated patients participating in a Phase 2b clinical study of vicriviroc, AIDS Clinical Trial Group (ACTG) trial, A5211.  The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID) Therapeutic DSMB overseeing the trial concluded that a causal association between vicriviroc and the lymphoma cases could not be established at that time.  This experience is in contrast to findings of a 1999 article that reported a reduced risk of AIDS-associated 
lymphoma in HIV-infected CCR5 Δ32 gene heterozygotes when compared to individuals 
without the polymorphism.
12Currently, the data from clinical studies in treatment-
experienced HIV-1 infected patients do not indicate a clinically meaningful alteration in the frequency or severity of infections or malignancy related to the use of maraviroc. In the phase 2b/3 trials of maraviroc (MOTIVATE 1, MOTIVATE 2) at 48 weeks no difference in rates of lymphoma was demonstrated between maraviroc and placebo treatment arms, despi[INVESTIGATOR_455377].
[IP_ADDRESS]. Myocardial Infarction
Metabolic abnormalities associated with HIV-1 infection, including glucose homeostasis 
disturbances and dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], are increasingly prevalent, and there is concern about the possibility of an association with accelerated cardiovascular disease. In addition, recent results from the D:A:D Study, an international collaboration of 11 cohorts following 23,468 HIV-infected patients prospectively in 21 countries situated in Europe, the [LOCATION_003], and Australia, indicated that the incidence of myocardial infarction (MI) increased by 26% per year of exposure to combination antiretroviral treatment, consistent with the hypothesis that atherosclerosis is a side-effect of combination antiretroviral treatment, generally attributed to

Page 10 of 64PIs dosed simultaneously with NRTIs.13The data from the Phase 2b/[ADDRESS_582084] likely due to the design of the study and the limited follow up time in the placebo arm. Due to the relatively small data it is currently unknown whether the addition of maraviroc will modify the rate of MI occurrence in HIV-1 infected patients receiving HAART.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Rhabdomyolysis
Rhabdomyolysis is a condition associated with the injury of skeletal muscle. 
Rhabdomyolysis was initially described as a complication of traumatic injury particularly crush injuries however infections and most notably certain classes of drugs such as statins have been associated with this disorder. Myopathy has also been associated with nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), most notably zidovudine, which are commonly used in the treatment of patients with HIV. In the phase 2b/3 trials of maraviroc (MOTIVATE 1, MOTIVATE 2) subjects receiving maraviroc had a higher median change in creatine kinase compared to placebo. There was also a higher incidence of creatine kinase abnormalities (>2x ULN) in subjects receiving maraviroc: 30% and 29% on maraviroc QD and BID respectively, compared to 20% on placebo. Three patients in the MOTIVATE [ADDRESS_582085] and the theoretical risk of altered immune function leading to altered rates or severity of malignancy or infections, including opportunistic infections (OI) remain to be fully addressed. Given the imbalance in the incidence of myocardial ischemic events in the ongoing clinical trials of maraviroc, data on long-term follow-up for MI and myocardial ischemia incidence in patients receiving maraviroc along with HAART would more fully characterize this potential safety risk. As most of these patients receive lipid-lowering agents that may be associated with a heightened risk of rhabdomyoloysis, it is of interest to examine the incidence of this event.  All-cause mortality will also provide information regarding any possible long term implications of treatment with maraviroc.
The objective of this international, multicenter, prospective observational comparative study 
is to monitor the safety of long term use of maraviroc in a larger and more diverse patient population than that in which the phase 2b/[ADDRESS_582086]-approval safety study (PASS) and is a

6.1. Study Period
All subjects will be followed for up to [ADDRESS_582091]’s vital status, continued use of 
maraviroc, and study endpoints will be obtained through follow-up with the treating physician according to the local HIV/AIDS treatment guidelines and routine medical practice. Medical records and other documentation, where applicable, will be obtained to adjudicate study endpoints according to the endpoint adjudication manual. 
6.3. Follow-up of patients discontinuing maraviroc
If a patient discontinues maraviroc, the enrolling physician will record information on the 
date of and primary reason for discontinuation. Discontinuation of maraviroc due to adverse events should be distinguished from discontinuation due to insufficient response, and any serious adverse events (SAE) should be reported immediately to [COMPANY_007], as the Sponsor’s designated representative. A change in any of the components of OBT will not be considered as treatment discontinuation if the patient continues to receive maraviroc, but these changes in regimen will be recorded on patient questionnaires by [CONTACT_455405]. Follow-up will continue after a patient discontinues maraviroc up to a total period of 5 years since enrollment, and safety data will be collected and reported for a total of 5 years following enrollment as well.

In the situation where neither the patient nor the secondary contact [CONTACT_9702](s) can be reached, 
attempts will be made to ascertain the vital status of the patient by [CONTACT_455406], where available and allowable by [CONTACT_1769]. Depending on the local law, this search will be conducted by a designated CRO, or a professional search firm, or the enrolling physician or his/her designee at the study site. Medical records of these patients cannot be obtained or reviewed for adjudication of any death event.  Therefore, the supplemental data on the un-adjudicated mortality events will not be included in the primary analyses of the study. It should be noted that there is usually a lag between calendar time of death and the time that data are available from vital status registries, due to the additional time necessary for government agencies to collate information from regional death registries and to check these data for accuracy. In the U.S. National Death Index, the delay is approximately 18 months.
6.5. Follow-up of patients switched to non-participating physicians
If for any reason (eg, relocation, insurance change) a patient switches to a physician who is 
not participating in the study, the patient will be discontinued from the study. The enrolling physician will complete a follow up questionnaire with the last available clinical data and the subject summary module of the questionnaire. If the patient does not withdraw consent to participate in the study, an attempt will be made to ascertain the vital status of the patient as mentioned in Section 6.[ADDRESS_582093] of any of the following events:
•Withdrawal of consent by [CONTACT_102];
•Death of the patient;
•Completion of five years since entry into the study;
•Switching to another CCR5 inhibitor medication (Applicable for maraviroc 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]);
•If a patient in the maraviroc-unexposed comparator group commences treatment with

This study may be terminated or suspended by [CONTACT_313619].  If the study is 
terminated or suspended, the Sponsor will promptly inform the enrolling physicians/institutions and the regulatory authorities.  The IRB/IEC will be promptly informed and provided the reason(s) for the termination or suspension by [CONTACT_255565]/institution, as specified by [CONTACT_433052](s).
6.7. Subject Withdrawal
Subjects may withdraw their consent from study participation at any time at their own 
request, or they may be withdrawn at any time at the discretion of the enrolling physician or the Sponsor for behavioral or administrative reasons.  If a subject does not return for a scheduled visit, every effort should be made by [CONTACT_455407]/her alternate contacts, as provided by [CONTACT_423].  In any circumstance, every effort should be made to document subject outcome, if possible.  The enrolling physician should inquire about the reason for withdrawal, request the subjects to return for a final visit, if applicable, and follow-up with the subject regarding any unresolved serious adverse events and study endpoints.
The enrolling physician should determine the primary reason for withdrawal of consent, as 
well as any contributory factors, and record this information on the follow-up questionnaire.  Withdrawal must be reported immediately if it is due to a serious adverse event.
If the subject withdraws from the study and also withdraws consent for disclosure of future 
information, no further evaluations should be performed and no additional data should be collected.  The sponsor may retain and continue to use any data collected before such withdrawal of consent.
6.8. Transfer of Study Data
The study sites will report data without any personal identifiers other than the study 
identification number using an electronic data capture system.

7.4. Endpoint Evaluation
At each visit after enrollment, the enrolling physician/investigator or designee will report all 
study endpoints for the subjects using an endpoint notification form.  These endpoints may be identified by [CONTACT_455417] a follow-up visit or reported to the enrolling physician by [CONTACT_455418]. For subjects lost to follow-up, survival status may be identified through standard measures used in cohort studies, such as alternate contacts and tracking mechanisms (eg, national or regional death certificate data)however, endpoints will not be collected for adjudication.  
When any of the study endpoints are identified or diagnosed, the enrolling physician will 
report the occurrence using an endpoint notification form and obtain the relevant medical 
records necessary to adjudicate the endpoint.  The enrolling physician may request hospi[INVESTIGATOR_455386].  Where necessary and applicable, subjects will be contact[CONTACT_455419][INVESTIGATOR_1097].
These documents will be forwarded by [CONTACT_455420] (EC) in a de-identified format with the subject’s study number added.  The detailed process and timeframe for this endpoint data collection is described in the study Endpoint Manual.
De-identified copi[INVESTIGATOR_455387], with translations into English where necessary, will be

Page 21 of 64Study endpoints that are closely temporally related to drug exposures ie, CDC category C 
opportunistic infections, viral encephalitis, rhabdomyolysis and liver failure will cease to be adjudicated as study endpoints after six months following discontinuation of maraviroc.  For patients in the maraviroc unexposed comparator group, adjudication of these events will cease after six months following discontinuation of the anchor drug in their OBT asidentified at baseline (Section 7.2).  If these events are diagnosed after this cut-off period,
they will be considered as any other adverse event and reported per the Adverse Event Reporting guidelines described in Section 8, which requires the collection and reporting of all serious adverse events (SAE) and all adverse reactions. Occurrence of myocardial infarction or ischemia, malignancies, and death (all-cause and liver-related) will be reported and adjudicated as study endpoints for up to five years following enrollment.
The follow-up duration for malignancies may be extended beyond five years if, based on 
emerging safety data, the Scientific Steering Committee (SSC) overseeing the study recommends a longer period of observation. Due to the potentially prolonged time required for a malignancy to become clinically apparent, a search of national and state cancer and death registries will be performed to look for all epi[INVESTIGATOR_455389] [ADDRESS_582096] the study on behalf of ViiV.  All 
adverse event reporting under this section will be to [COMPANY_007], as the Sponsor’s designated representative, using forms provided by [CONTACT_4618].
8.1.
ADVERSE EVENTS
All observed or volunteered serious adverse events (SAE) regardless of treatment group or
suspected causal relationship to maraviroc and all non-serious adverse events suspected by [CONTACT_455422] (ie, adverse reactions) will be recorded on the adverse event page(s) of the case report form (CRF) as follows.
For all adverse events, the investigator must pursue and obtain information adequate both to 
determine the outcome of the adverse event and to assess whether it meets the criteria for classification as a serious adverse event (see section "Serious Adverse Events”) requiring immediate notification to [COMPANY_007] as the Sponsor’s designated representative. For all adverse events, sufficient information should be obtained by [CONTACT_325274]. The investigator is required to assess causality.

[COMPANY_007] on behalf of the Sponsor concurs with that assessment.
8.2. Reporting Period
For serious adverse events, the reporting period to [COMPANY_007], as the Sponsor’s designated
representative begins from the time that the subject provides informed consent or signed data privacy statement, which is obtained prior to the subject’s participation in the study to [ADDRESS_582097] or medical device; the event need not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment or usage.  Examples of adverse events include but are not limited to:  
•Abnormal test findings;
•Clinically significant symptoms and signs;
•Changes in physical examination findings;
•Hypersensitivity;
•Progression/worsening of underlying disease.
Additionally, they may include the signs or symptoms resulting from:
•Drug overdose;
•Drug withdrawal;
•Drug abuse;
•Drug misuse;
•Drug interactions;
•Drug dependency;
•Extravasation;
•Exposure in during pregnancy;
•Exposure during breast feeding;

Page 23 of 64•Medication error.
8.4. Abnormal Test Findings
The criteria for determining whether an abnormal objective test finding should be reported as 
an adverse event are as follows: 
•Test result is associated with accompanying symptoms; and/or
•Test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention;
and/or
•Test result leads to a change in study dosing or discontinuation from the study,
significant additional concomitant drug treatment, or other therapy; and/or
•Test result is considered to be an adverse event by [CONTACT_8893].
Merely repeating an abnormal test, in the absence of any of the above conditions, does not 
constitute an adverse event.  Any abnormal test result that is determined to be an error does 
not require reporting as an adverse event.
8.5. Serious Adverse Events
A serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence at any dose that:
•Results in death;
•Is life-threatening (immediate risk of death);
•Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081];
•Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity;
•Results in congenital anomaly/birth defect.
Medical and scientific judgment is exercised in determining whether an event is an important 
medical event.  An important medical event may not be immediately life threatening and/or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  However, if it is determined that the event may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention to prevent one of the other adverse event outcomes, the important medical event should be reported as serious.
Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for 
allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or development of drug dependency or drug abuse.

Admission also includes transfer within the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4591]/intensive care unit (eg, from the psychiatric wing to a medical floor, medical floor to a coronary care unit, neurological floor to a tuberculosis unit).
8.7. Causality Assessment
The investigator’s assessment of causality must be provided for all serious adverse events 
and non-serious adverse reactions. The investigator must record the causal relationship in the CRF, as appropriate, and report such an assessment in accordance with the serious adverse reporting requirements if applicable.  An investigator's causality assessment is the determination of whether there exists a reasonable possibility that maraviroc caused or contributed to an adverse event.  If the investigator's final determination of causality is 
unknown and the investigator does not know whether maraviroc caused the event, then the 
event will be handled as related to maraviroc for reporting purposes.  If the investigator’s causality assessment is unknown but not related to maraviroc  this should be clearly 
documented in the CRF.
8.8. Exposure During Pregnancy
An exposure during pregnancy (also referred to as exposure in-utero [EIU]) occurs if:
1. A female becomes, or is found to be, pregnant either while receiving or having been
directly exposed to (eg, environmental exposure) maraviroc, or the female becomes, or is found to be, pregnant after discontinuing and/or being directly exposed to maraviroc(maternal exposure);
2. A male has been exposed, either due to treatment or environmental, to maraviroc prior to 
or around the time of conception and/or is exposed during his partner’s pregnancy (paternal exposure).
If any study subject or study subject’s partner becomes or is found to be pregnant during the
study subject’s treatment with maraviroc , the investigator must submit this information to 
[COMPANY_007], as the Sponsor’s designated representative, within 24 hours of awareness of pregnancy, irrespective of whether an adverse event has occurred.
Follow-up is conducted to obtain pregnancy outcome information on all Exposure in Utero
reports with an unknown outcome. The investigator will follow the pregnancy until completion or until pregnancy termination (eg, induced abortion) and then notify [COMPANY_007], as the Sponsor’s designated representative, of the outcome. The investigator will provide this information as a follow up to the initial Exposure in Utero Form.

Page 25 of 648.8.1. Medication Error
A medication error is any preventable event that may cause or lead to inappropriate 
medication use or patient harm while the medication is in the control of the health care professional, patient, or consumer.  Such events may be related to professional practice, health care products, procedures, and systems including: prescribing; order communication; product labeling, packaging, and nomenclature; compounding; dispensing; distribution; administration; education; monitoring; and use.  
Medication errors include:
•near misses, involving or not involving a patient directly (eg, inadvertent/erroneous 
administration, which is the accidental use of a product outside of labeling or 
prescription on the part of the healthcare provider or the patient/consumer).
•confusion with regard to invented name (eg, trade name, brand name).
The investigator must submit the following medication errors to [COMPANY_007] within 24 hours of 
awareness, irrespective of whether an adverse event occurred:
•Medication errors involving patient exposure to the product, whether or not the 
medication error is accompanied by [CONTACT_1149].
•Medication errors including potential medication errors or near misses that do not 
involve a patient directly.  When a medication error does not involve patient exposure 
to the product the following minimum criteria constitute a medication error report:
•An identifiable reporter;
•A suspect product;
•A medication error including potential medication error or near miss.
8.9. Reporting Requirements
Each adverse event is to be assessed to determine if it meets the criteria for serious adverse 
event. If a serious adverse event occurs, expedited reporting will follow local and international regulations, as appropriate. 
8.9.1. Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements
If a serious adverse event occurs, [COMPANY_007] is to be notified within [ADDRESS_582098] be made immediately, irrespective of the extent of 
available adverse event information.  This timeframe also applies to additional new information (follow-up) on previously forwarded serious adverse event reports as well as to the initial and follow-up reporting of exposure during pregnancy cases.

Page 26 of 64In the rare event that the investigator does not become aware of the occurrence of a serious 
adverse event immediately (eg, if an outpatient study subject initially seeks treatment elsewhere), the investigator is to report the event within 24 hours after learning of it and document the time of his/her first awareness of the adverse event.
For all serious adverse events, the investigator is obligated to pursue and provide information 
to [COMPANY_007] in accordance with the timeframes for reporting specified above. In addition, an investigator may be requested by [CONTACT_4695]-up information in an expedited fashion. This information collected for serious adverse events is more detailed than that captured on the adverse event case report form. In general, this will include a description of the adverse event in sufficient detail to allow for a complete medical assessment of the case and independent determination of possible causality. Information on other possible causes of the event, such as concomitant medications and illnesses must be provided.  In the case of a subject death, a summary of available autopsy findings must be submitted as soon as possible to the Sponsor or its designated representative.
8.9.2. Non-serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirement
Non-serious adverse events are to be reported if they are suspected to be related to maraviroc 
(ie, adverse reaction) on the adverse event page, which is to be submitted to [COMPANY_007], as the Sponsor’s designated representative.
8.10. Communication of Issues
In the event of any prohibition or restriction imposed (eg, clinical hold) by [CONTACT_392814], or if the investigator is aware of any newinformation which might influence the evaluation of the benefits and risks of maraviroc, [COMPANY_007], as the Sponsor’s designated representative, should be informed immediately.
In addition, the investigator will inform [COMPANY_007], as the Sponsor’s designated representative,
immediately of any urgent safety measures taken by [CONTACT_1205], and of any serious breaches of this non-interventional study protocol that the investigator becomes aware of.
9. DATA ANALYSIS/STATISTICAL METHODS
Detailed methodology for summary and statistical analyses of data collected in this study will 
be documented in a Statistical Analysis Plan, which will be dated, filed, and maintained by [CONTACT_456].  This document may modify the plans outlined in the protocol; however, any major modifications of the primary endpoint definition and/or its analysis will also be reflected in a protocol amendment.

Malignancies, myocardial ischemia or infarction and deaths (liver-related and all cause) 
occurring at any time during the 5-year follow-up period will be adjudicated and analyzed as study endpoints.  Assuming up to 10% annual loss to follow-up, the 1,500 patients each receiving maraviroc or the anchor drug will contribute 5,836 person-years of observation for these study endpoints over a 5-year period (See Scenario 1 in Appendix 3  for details) in each 
treatment arm.  It is assumed that the expected incidence rates are 12.7 per 1000 person-years for malignancies,
143.5 per 1,000 person-years for myocardial infarction,132.35 per 1,000

CDC category C AIDS-defining opportunistic infections, viral encephalitis, rhabdomyolysis 
and liver failure will be adjudicated and analyzed as study endpoints if they occur during the use of maraviroc or the anchor drug in the OBT arm or within 6 months following maraviroc or anchor drug discontinuation.  Accounting for the expected rates of drug discontinuation in the two treatment arms over time and a 10% annual loss to follow-up, each study arm will accrue 2,875 person-years of observation for these study endpoints (See Scenario 2 in Appendix 3  for details).

Page 28 of 649.2. Analysis of Study Endpoint
This study is intended to provide descriptive and comparative data on the incidence rates of 
the selected study endpoints in the two study groups. 
1. Descriptive statistics (ie, frequency, percent, mean, median, standard deviation as 
appropriate depending on data type) will be used to summarize baseline characteristics (clinical and demographic)  of patients enrolled in the study.  
(Potential variables include but are not limited to age, gender, weight, BMI, race, smoking, alcohol consumption, HIV-1 RNA level, CD4+ T lymphocyte counts, duration of antiretroviral therapy, duration of HIV infection, number of failed regimens etc).
2. Cumulative incidence rates and incidence-density rates of the study endpoints in the 
two groups will be reported along with respective 95% confidence intervals. 
3. Subject discontinuation, loss to follow-up and total person-time of follow-up accrued 
in the study will be summarized. 
4. Depending on data availability, subgroup analyses may be performed to further 
describe the rates of the study endpoints stratified by [CONTACT_551], gender, baseline CD4+ cell counts, baseline viral load, hepatitis C/hepatitis B serology, duration of maraviroc use, total duration of antiretroviral use, components of OBT etc. 
5. In addition to the selected study endpoints, SAEs and adverse reactions reported 
during the study will be summarized in summary tables and listings. 
6. Crude and adjusted rate ratios with 95% confidence intervals will be calculated for 
each study endpoint comparing maraviroc-exposed patients to maraviroc-unexposed 
patients. Multivariate analysis techniques, including recurrent event analyses 
techniques, will also be used as appropriate to account for the baseline difference in the two study groups and recurrent events if any for a given subject, respectively.
In addition, incidence rates in patients receiving maraviroc in this study may be compared to 
those reported in comparable patients not using maraviroc in other HIV-1 infected cohort(s) such as EuroSIDA. The baseline characteristics of the patients (eg, number of failed regimens, CD4+ T lymphocyte counts) in this study will be used to identify comparable subjects from the external cohort(s).
10. QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE
During study conduct, [COMPANY_007] or Sponsor will conduct periodic monitoring visits of sites at 
least once a year to ensure that the protocol is being followed.  The monitors may review source documents to confirm that the data recorded on questionnaire pages is accurate.  The enrolling physician and institution will allow the Sponsor or its designated representatives and appropriate regulatory authorities direct access to source documents to perform this verification.

It is important that the enrolling physician(s) and their relevant personnel are available during 
the monitoring visits and possible audits or inspections and that sufficient time is devoted to the process. 
11. DATA HANDLING AND RECORD KEEPI[INVESTIGATOR_1645]
11.1. Questionnaires
As used in this protocol, the term questionnaire refers to either a paper form or an electronic 
data record or both, depending on the data collection method used in this study.
Baseline (screening and enrollment), follow-up, and final disposition questionnaires are 
required and should be completed for each included subject.  The completed original questionnaires are the sole property of the Sponsor and should not be made available in any 
form to third parties, except for authorized representatives of the Sponsor or appropriate 
regulatory authorities, without written permission from the Sponsor.
The enrolling physician has ultimate responsibility for the accuracy and authenticity of all 
clinical, safety, laboratory data entered on the questionnaires.  The questionnaires must be signed by [CONTACT_455425].  In most cases, the source documents are the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]'s or the physician's subject chart.  In these cases data collected on the questionnaires must match the data in those charts. 
In some cases, the questionnaire, or part of the questionnaire, may also serve as source 
documents.  In these cases, a document should be available at the enrolling physician’s site as well as at the Sponsor and clearly identify those data that will be recorded in the questionnaire, and for which the questionnaire will stand as the source document.
11.2. Record Retention
To enable evaluations and/or audits from regulatory authorities or the Sponsor, the enrolling 
physician agrees to keep records, including the identity of all participating subjects (sufficient information to link records, eg, questionnaires and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097]), all original signed informed consent forms, copi[INVESTIGATOR_150236], serious adverse event forms, source documents, and detailed records of treatment disposition.  After the end of the study the records should be retained by [CONTACT_455426], whichever is longer.

15. OVERSIGHT COMMITTEES
15.1. Scientific Steering Committee
The Scientific Steering Committee (SSC) is an external group of epi[INVESTIGATOR_623], biostatistics, 
infectious disease/HIV medicine, hepatology, cardiology, and oncology experts that will serve two roles: (1) to safeguard the interests of study participants and (2) to monitor study conduct, in conjunction with the sponsor study team.  The remit of the SSC will be described in the charter for the SSC. In summary, the role of the SSC will be to periodically monitor the progress of the study, including logistical and operational aspects, to establish acceptable 
performance criteria (eg, acceptable rates of withdrawn consent and loss to follow-up), to 
evaluate the quality of the data being collected in the study, and to assist the sponsor in the development of any remedial plans of action as necessary. The SSC may propose changes to the study design and conduct including follow-up duration, as the committee deems necessary based on emerging safety data.  In the event of recommendations for a significant change by [CONTACT_121187], the Sponsor will notify regu latory agencies where necessary, as per legal 
or regulatory requirements.
15.2. Endpoint Committee
The Endpoint Committee will review all study endpoints occurring over the course of the 
study.  The EC will be comprised of an independent group of infectious disease specialists, hepatologists, cardiologists and oncologists experienced in the treatment of HIV-1 infection and/or the study of HIV in large observational study settings.  The members of the EC will receive de-identified data gathered on subjects who are suspected to have experienced a study outcome and will be responsible for adjudicating and coding the endpoints as described in Section 7.4.

Scenario 1
Endpoints:  All cause mortality, Liver-related death, Malignancies, Myocardial ischemia and 
infarction
Expected person-time of observation in maraviroc exposed and unexposed groups:
These events occurring at anytime during the 5-year follow up period will be adjudicated and 
analyzed as study endpoints. It is assumed that each year 10% patients will be lost to follow-up and that on average these losses will occur at the midpoint of the [ADDRESS_582112] 
of the period

follow-up)n at the end of the 
period

Year 1 [PHONE_9546] 1425.0
Year 2 [PHONE_9547] 1282.5

Year 4 1094 [PHONE_9549].5
Year 5 984 98 886 935.0
Total person-years 5835.0
Based on the above assumptions, both these groups will accrue 5835 person-years of 
follow-up during the study for the assessment of all cause mortality, Liver-related death, Malignancies, Myocardial ischemia and infarction.
Scenario 2:  
Endpoints: CDC category C AIDS-defining opportunistic infection, viral encephalitis, liver 
failure, rhabdomyolysis
Expected person-time of observation in:
These events will be adjudicated and analyzed as study endpoints if they occur during use of 
maraviroc or the anchor drug in the OBT, or within 6 months following their discontinuation
•Based on clinical experience, it is assumed that the rate of drug discontinuation will 
be higher in the earlier part of the study and will gradually decrease over time.  To 
obtain a conservative estimate, it is assumed based on the observations from the 48-week clinical development program of maraviroc that the rate of discontinuation will be approximately 30% during the first 6 months of therapy, 25% between the 7
th
and 12th month, 20% between the 13th and 18th months and 15% in each 6 month

Page 40 of 64period thereafter.  For the purpose of this calculation it is assumed that on average 
discontinuation occurs at the midpoint of each 6-month period.  
•It is assumed that 5% of the patients (either continuing maraviroc or during the 
[ADDRESS_582113] discontinuation follow-up) will be lost every 6 months and on average 
these losses will occur at the midpoint of the 6-month period.  
•Patients lost to follow-up during any 6-month period (either on or off maraviroc) will 
contribute only 3 months of follow-up time during that period.  Patients who are 
being actively followed up at the end of each 6-month period will contribute 6 months of follow-up time.
Based on the above assumptions, both these groups will accrue 2875 person-years of 
follow-up during the study for the assessment of AIDS-defining OI, viral encephalitis, rhabdomyolysis and liver failure.

after such discontinuation.
[COMPANY_007]'s posting on ClinicalStudyResults.org includes the following elements:
•Protocol title, study phase, and indication;
•A link to approved product labeling, if applicable;
•The synopsis of study results;
•Citations of known study publications;
•Legal disclaimer.
If posting of study results to ClinicalStudyResults.org jeopardizes a planned publication of 
the study r esults, a Pending Full Publication notice is substituted for the synopsis until the 
study results publication has issued or two years have elapsed, whichever occurs first. 
[COMPANY_007] posts citations only for publications that are accessible in recognized (sea rchable) 
publication databases.  Single -centre results publications for a multi -centre study are 
generally not posted because they may not accurately reflect the results of the study.
Publication of study results is discussed in the Clinical Study Agreement.
Communication of Results Where required by [CONTACT_25435], an investigator signatory will 
be identified for the approval of the clinical study report.  The investigator will be provided reasonable access to statistical tables, figures, and relevant reports and will have the opportunity to review the complete study results at a Sponsor site or other mutually-agreeable location.
Sponsor will also provide the investigator with the full summary of the study results.  
The investigator is encouraged to share the summary results with the study subjects, as appropriate.
The results summary will be posted to an internet-based study register at the time of 
the first regulatory approval or within [ADDRESS_582146] regulatory approval or within 12 months of study completion or of any decision to terminate development.

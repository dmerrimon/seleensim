April  7, 2020 1. Background  
1.1.  Non-Pharmacologic Interventions to Improve Blood Pressure Control  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_154728], compelling data that 
blood pressure (BP) lowering reduces mortality and cardiovascular events, and decades of public 
health campaigns, half of American adults with hypertension do not achiev e adequate BP 
control.1–[ADDRESS_179078] -lead 
education and medication titration, and/or financial incentives. Though man y of these 
interventions improve short -term blood pressure control,4–[ADDRESS_179079] been widely implemented.  
Though consensus guidelines recommend dietary changes to improve hypertension control, with 
a particular recommendation in favor of the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) 
diet,14,15 very few U.S. patients adhere to this complex dietary pattern.16,17 The DASH diet 
reduced systolic BP (SBP) by 11 mmHg in randomized controlled trials in which participants 
were provided with food,18,19 and 4 mmHg in a study testing a 6 -month, 18 -visit intensive 
lifestyle intervention intended to promote the DASH diet;[ADDRESS_179080] to the DASH diet, intermittent fasting (IF) is a dietary pattern that emphasizes 
temporal restriction of caloric intake rather than restricting the number of calories and/or 
changing the types of foods eaten.[ADDRESS_179081] popular variation of IF involves 
restricting caloric intake to an 8 -hour period each day, and consuming no calories for the other 
16 hours (so -called 16:8 time -restricted feeding).23 In animal studies, IF has been shown to 
activate cellular pathways wit h potential disease -modifying benefits in a number of conditions.22 
In small human studies, IF is associated with a reduction in SBP by 5-10 mmHg, LDL 
cholesterol by ~8 mg/dl, and weight by ~ 3 kg, though none of the studies of a time -restricted 
feeding regimen included concurrent controls.23–29 Some patients report that IF is easier to 
initiate and maintain than other dietary patterns, though this has not been tested empi[INVESTIGATOR_3675].30 
1.3. Commitm ent Devices to Promote Healthy Behaviors     
Commitment devices  are centered in theoretical research that posits a planner -doer framework, 
wherein an individual can be conceptualized as dual sub -selves: The planner, who cares about 
long-term well -being; and the doer, who cares only for the present and prioritizes immediate 
payoffs.[ADDRESS_179082] also been framed as 
implementation intentions, or specific plans as to where, how, and/or when an action will be 
taken.35 In small experiments, smokers who set a quit date were more likely to quit, and college 
students who set a date and time to visit a vaccination clinic were more likely to receive their 
vaccination.36,37 Interpersonal commitments leverage social networks, so that the penalty 
involves letting down a support partner.38 Involvement of social networks has been used to 
increase physical activity and improve control of weight and blood glucose in patients with 
obesity and diabetes.39–[ADDRESS_179083] commitment device 
intervention. Changing one’s eating patterns to a complex new diet is a cognitively intense  
process that requires active consideration of complex information multiple times per day, leading 
to cognitive overload and impaired decision -making.47–[ADDRESS_179084] soft commitm ent device, incorporating both intra - and 
interpersonal commitments, affects uptake and adherence to an intermittent fasting dietary 
pattern, as compared with control, in patients with obesity and hypertension  
2. Study  Objectives  
The objectives of this study  are the following:  
1. To determine the effect of a robust soft commitment device, incorporating both intra - and 
interpersonal commitments, on uptake and adherence to an intermittent fasting dietary 
pattern, as compared with control, in patients with hyperten sion and obesity  
2. To determine the effect of the intervention promoting intermittent fasting on blood 
pressure  and weight  in patients with hypertension and obesity  
 
3. Study  Design  
3.1.  General Overview  
The IFAST  study is a two-arm randomized controlled trial aimed at evaluating whether a soft 
commitment device increases uptake and adherence to an intermittent fasting dietary pattern 
compared with control in patients with hypertension and obesity. The study will randomi ze 34 
patients  with hypertension and obesity  to a 12-week  intervention employing a commitment 
pledge, involvement of a supportive partner, setting of implementation intentions, and multiple 
daily reminder text messages or to an attention control involving daily text mes sages alone. 
Version 1 .1  4 
April  7, 2020 Following the intervention, there will be a 6 -week follow -up period  (see study protocol figure 
below) . 
 
  
 
The study will be conducted using Way to Health, a research information technology platform at 
the University of Pennsylvania used previously for behavioral interventions.  
 
After institutional review board (IRB) approval of the study, patients who meet the eligibility 
criteria will be approached in select cardiology clinics and invite d to participat e. Those who 
qualify and express interest will provide informed consent to the study procedures  via the Way to 
Health platform . All patients will receive a blood pressure cuff and scale, which will be used to 
measure blood pressure and weight weekly . Within the Way to Health platform,  patients will be 
randomized to the intervention or control arms. All other  management decisions are completely 
at the discretion of the care providers.  Data capture will include : 
 Baseline case report form (for each patient) collecting clinical information abs tracted 
from the medical record  
 Baseline survey collected via the Way to Health platform including psychometric 
questions, dietary patterns, and experiences with weight loss and dieting  
 Daily adherence to an intermittent fasting dietary pattern collected v ia self -report 
from text messages  
 Weekly weight and blood pressure measurement collected via self -report from text 
messages   
 

Version [ADDRESS_179085]  will enroll patients from cardiology clinics at the Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_154729]/or via email.  
 
3.3.  Patient Selection Criteria  
3.3.1.  Inclusion Criteria  
Patients are eligible to be included in the study if they are ≥ 18 years of age and meet all of the 
following criteria:  
1. Body mass index > 30 kg/m2 
2. Systolic blood pressure > 1 40 mmHg  
3. Owns a smartp hone or tablet operating the iOS or Android operating system  
 
3.3.2.  Exclusion Criteria  
Patients are excluded if they meet any of the following criteria:  
1. Unable or unwilling to provide informed consent, including but not limited to cognitive 
or language barriers (reading or comprehension)  
2. Type 1 diabetes  
3. Use of insulin or insulin secretagogues (sulfonylureas, metaglinides)  
4. Use of medications that require food intake  
5. Ongoing use of pharmacologic therapy for weight loss  
6. Self-reported eating disorder  
7. Other m edical condition that could be harmed by [CONTACT_154736]  
8. Anticipated life expectancy less than 6 months  
9. Any other reason why it is not fe asible to complete the entire 6 -month study  
 
4.  Study Procedures  
4.1. Screening and Informed Consent  
Patients with body mass index > 30 kg/m2 and SBP > [ADDRESS_179086] and working well. Three weeks after the initial recruitment 
emails/letters are sent, a second batch will  be sent. Every [ADDRESS_179087] information will remain easily accessible via the participants’ individual Way 
to Health web portal da shboards throughout the study.   
Support partners will provide verbal informed consent via telephone for their name, email 
address, and phone number to be stored in the study database.  
Once participants have completed the informed consent process, they wil l be mailed a scale and 
blood pressure cuff.  
4.2. Baseline Questionnaire  and Intermittent Fasting Education  
After providing informed consent, participants will complete an online questionnaire.  The 
baseline surveys will ask about  dietary patterns and experiences with weight loss and dieting . 
Patients will also complete the Grit Scale and the MOS Social Support survey  to obtain a 
psychometric profile relevant for persistence with a dietary intervention . They will also complete 
the [ADDRESS_179088] to Health platform  to attention control  or 
the soft commitment device  using 1:1 allocation . Randomization will be stratified based on BMI 
(≤ and > 40 kg/m2) and systolic blood pressure (≤ and > 160 mmHg) and will us e blocks of [ADDRESS_179089] 
pledging to adhere to the 16:[ADDRESS_179090] t o Health: Once at the start of their fast period  and once during the meal that they 
skip during the fast period. Each week, participants and their support partner will also receive a 
text message noting how many days in the previous week they successfully fasted for at least 16 
hours. After the 12 week intervention , these text messages will stop, but for the entire 18-week  
period, participants in this arm will receive the same text messages as the attention control arm: 
A daily text message asking if they f asted for at least [ADDRESS_179091] to Health platform to 
return to the website to complete an end -of-study questionnaire regarding their experience with 
IF.  
 
5. Statistical Methods  
5.1 Primary and secondary outcome measures  
The study’s primary outcome measure is adherence to the IF regimen, captured via daily text 
message, over 1 8 weeks, expressed in days per week.  
 
Secondary outcome measures will include:  
1) Adherence to the IF regimen over 12 weeks  
2) Change in systolic blood p ressure from baseline to 12 weeks and 1 8 weeks  
3) Change in weight from baseline to 12 weeks and 1 8 weeks  
Exploratory analyses will compare change in blood pressure and weight in patients that were 
adherent t o IF ≥ 4 days per week vs. < 4 days per week  
 
5.2.  Sample Size  
With 34 patients (17 per arm), we will have 90% power to detect a [ADDRESS_179092] deviation in days fasted per week < [ADDRESS_179093] ~ 50% power to detect a 10 mmHg change in systolic and diastolic blood pressure 
(assuming a standard deviation of 15 mmHg) and a 3 kg weight loss (assuming a standard 
deviation of 5 kg) . 
 
5.3.  Data Analyses  
Data for all patients  who received at least [ADDRESS_179094].  Secondary analyses compare 
change from baseline in blood pressure and weight between arms using mixed effects regression 
models. Exploratory analyses will compare change from baseline in blood pressure and weight in 
patients who reported fasting ≥ 4 days/week versus those who reported fasting < 4 days/week 
using mixed effects regression models.

required by 365 law and/or n ecessary for oversight purposes.  
 
6.[ADDRESS_179098] information regarding the issue and then the PI [INVESTIGATOR_154730], further investigation is needed, or the 
participant should stop the study. For this study there will be no stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_154731].  
 
6.6  Risk/benefit  
6.6.1  Potential study risks  
Both arms will be instructed to pursue an IF dietary pattern, which has been shown to be 
generally safe across multiple studies. Potential adverse effects of IF include irritability, hunger, 
difficulty with concentration, development of an eating disorder, disrupted  sleep, dehydration 
and dizziness, and feelings of guilt and increased stress. There is a theoretical risk of 
hypoglycemia and pancreatitis. At the start of the study, patients will be given information on 
risks of IF and guidance on when to seek medical a ttention. They will also be encouraged to 
consume plenty of fluids during their daily fasting period. Patients on insulin or insulin 
secretagogues will be excluded from participation, limiting the risk of iatrogenic hypoglycemia, 
but patients with diabetes  mellitus will be asked about epi[INVESTIGATOR_154732], and all patients will be asked about hospi[INVESTIGATOR_154733].  
 
Another potential risk of this study is a breach of participant conf identiality. We will minimize 
this risk by [CONTACT_154739]. Names and addresses will be 
stored in encrypted databases. These data will be viewable only by [CONTACT_154740], 
the study coordinator(s) and the proje ct manager(s). All other members of the research team will 
be able to view only participant ID numbers. Even the study arms will be identified by [CONTACT_154741] [INVESTIGATOR_154734].  
 
6.6.[ADDRESS_179099] tremendous benefits for society if adopted on a wide scale to help 
individuals. It is expected that other people will gain knowledge from this study and that 
participation could help unde rstand how to effectively motivate individuals to change behavior. 
Participants may also receive no benefit from their participation in the study.  
 
6.6.3  Risk/benefit assessment  
Anticipated risks of this study should be minimal and the risk/benefit rati o is very favorable. To 
minimize the chance for serious and unexpected adverse events, study participants will be 
screened through exclusion criteria for any health conditions that may be exacerbated by 
[CONTACT_4907]. We have previously outli ned the procedures that will be used to 
prevent a breach of participant data.

WHO IS CONDUCTING THIS STUDY?  
[CONTACT_139210], a Cardiology Fellow at Aultman Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] , and [CONTACT_139211] , an Interventional cardiologist and Program director of the Cardiology 
Fellowship  at Aultman Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], are  responsible for conducting this clinical study.  [CONTACT_139212] , an interventional cardiologist  is responsible for the study design and compliance with 
regulations.     
DO I HAVE TO BE IN THIS STUDY?  
You can decide whether to take part in this study or not.  You are free to say yes or no.  If you 
say no, your regular medical care will not change.  Ev en if you join this study, you do not have 
to stay in it.  You may stop at any time.   
A research study is different from routine medical care in three ways:  1) there are  extra risks that 
we will tell you about in this form; 2) you may have some extra med ical tests and visits; 3) the 
study procedures, tests and visits follow a set plan that must be kept.  
WHO CAN TAKE PART IN THIS STUDY?  
You are being asked to take part in this study because you are having a cardiac catheterization  by 
[CONTACT_139187] ( using the artery in your wrist) . 
WHAT IS THE USUAL APPROACH FOR  CARDIAC 
CATHETERIZATION ? 
Cardiac catheterization can be done either by [CONTACT_139188] (i.e., using the artery in your 
thigh) or transradial approach (i.e., using the artery in your wris t). While each approach has its 
merits and limitations, your provider has elected for you to undergo a transradial approach. 
While transradial approach has been shown to have lower risk of complications as well as 
improved patient discomfort, the smaller s ize of the radial artery (artery in wrist) may lead to 
difficulties during the procedure in a small fraction of patients undergoing the procedure. You 
will be asked to lie flat on the operating table and medications will be given to help you relax. 
Your pr ovider will administer a subcutaneous local anesthetic injection (to block pain sensation)

Page 4 of 17 as well as vasodilatory medications directly into the artery (to improve its size), during the 
procedure.  A sheath ( small tube ) will be  inserted into the radial artery. Medications are given 
through the tube to hel p relax the radial artery, which may cause a temporary burning sensation 
in the hand and arm. Blood thinners are also administered to help prevent the formation of blood 
clots w ithin the artery. Then the catheters will be  moved through the tube and guided to the 
heart. A coronary angiogram and , if required , stent placement may be performed.  After the 
completion of the procedure, the catheters and tubes will be  removed from the ra dial artery . An 
inflatable balloon type device will be placed on your wrist to help stop bleeding.  If cardiac 
catheterization is unsuccessful by [CONTACT_139187], a transfemoral approach may be used to 
complete the cardiac catheterization based on your  provider’s clinical judgment.  
EXPLANATION OF TERMS  
• Cardiac Catheterizatio n is a procedure that involves passing small catheters through 
your blood vessels in wrist or groin and injecting contrast dye to study the heart chambers 
(Ventriculogram) or blood v essels supplying the heart (Coronary Angiogram).  
• Coronary Angiogram  is a study of blood vessels supplying the heart (Coronary 
arteries). It is done by [CONTACT_139189] (A type of imaging stud y using Xrays). It helps to identify any 
blockages in the blood vessels supplying the heart. A significant blockage in these 
arteries can be the cause of chest pain (angina) or heart attack (myocardial infarction).  
• Ventriculogram is a study of ventricle (h eart chamber). It involves injecting dye into the 
heart chamber and studying its size, shape and function using fluoroscopy.  
• Transfemoral: Traditionally cardiac catheterization has been done by [CONTACT_139190]. This is called 
the Transfemoral approach.  
• Transradial: Cardiac catheterization can also be done by [CONTACT_139191]. This is called the Transradial 
approach. C ompared to transfemoral approach, transradial approach has less 
complications and patient comfort is more. When performed by [CONTACT_139192]. In about 
5-10% of the pa tients, transradial approach can be unsuccessful and a transfemoral 
approach may be needed.

Page 5 of 17 WHAT ARE MY OTHER CHOICES  IF I DO NOT TAKE PART IN THIS 
STUDY ? 
If you decide  not to take part in this study y ou may choose to have the usual approach described 
above . 
WHY IS THIS RESEARCH STUDY BEING DONE?  
The purpose of this study is to improve the success of cardiac catheterization by [CONTACT_139193].  Transradial approach 
chosen by [CONTACT_139194] (u sing the artery in the groin). Since the 
radial  artery is smaller than the femoral artery , it is more prone to spasm.  Cardiac catheterization 
by [CONTACT_139195] a switch to 
transfemoral approach to complete the procedure.  
This study is designed to look at the possibility o f using topi[INVESTIGATOR_139168], a vasodilator,  to 
increase the radial artery size and reduc e radial artery spasm. This may:  
• increase patient comfort ;  
• improve success of the transradial approach ; and  
• avoid the need for switchin g to transfermoral approach.  
HOW MANY PEOPLE WILL TAKE PART IN THE STUDY?  
There will be up to 300 people taking part in this study.  
WHAT ARE THE STUDY GROUPS?  
If you decide to take part in the study, in addition to the above mentioned usual treatment, you 
will rece ive topi[INVESTIGATOR_139169], a local anesthetic (numbing cream),  applied on your wrist 
one hour before the procedure. This  may reduce pain felt during  the lidocaine injection given as 
part of usual approach. Additionally , based on your random study assignment  you will  receive 
either topi[INVESTIGATOR_139170] (a vasodilator ) or placebo applied to your wrist . The 
nitroglycerine may increase size of the radial artery  and potentially impr ove the success of the 
procedure as well as your comfort during and after the procedure . 
EXPLANATION OF TERMS  
• Local anesthetic is a medication that acts locally on the nerves and blocks pain 
sensation. This is generally used during procedures involving man ipulation of skin and 
superficial tissues to ensure patients do not experience pain or discomfort during the

into the skin and tissues immediately below the skin.  
• Vasodilator is a medication that dilates blood vessels.  
You will  be randomly assigned to one of two groups:    
1. Treatment group: Will receive a combination of topi[INVESTIGATOR_139171].   
2. Placebo group: Will receive a combination of topi[INVESTIGATOR_139172].   
This is a double -blind study; neither you nor your doctor will know what group yo u are in.  After 
informed consent is obtained, you will be randomized to the treatment group or placebo group.  
Patients and physicians will be blinded to the administered drug ( topi[INVESTIGATOR_139173]. 
placebo).  
• Randomization  is a standard procedure use d in clinical trials where subjects are assigned 
by [CONTACT_139196].  It is used to make sure that the results of the 
study are not influenced by [CONTACT_139197]/patients in one group as compared to 
the other.  This is import ant to make certain that study results are accurately interpreted 
and therefore beneficial to future patients.  In this study, you have a 50:50 chance of 
being assigned to one group or another.   
• Double Blinding  is a process used in clinical trials where n either the person giving the 
treatment [doing the research] nor the patient [research subject] knows which treatment 
the patient [research subject] is receiving, or which group the research subject is 
participating in.  It is used in order to make sure tha t the subject and the person giving the 
treatment are not influenced by [CONTACT_139198].  
• Placebo  is an inactive substance (with no drug in it, often called a “sugar pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382]” or 
“dummy pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382]”) that is compared to a drug in a clinical trial to see if the drug has a real 
effect.  A placebo is often used in clinical trials in order to “blind” the study so th at the 
doctor and the subject cannot be influenced by [CONTACT_5657]/her expectations of the effects of the 
drug.  The study can be “un -blinded” in case of an emergency.  
WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF I TAKE PART IN THE STUDY ? 
Once you agree to participate in the study, you wil l receive all the standard treatment for cardiac 
catheterization by [CONTACT_139187] , as described above . 
On the day of the procedure you will report to Ambulatory Cardiac  Unit (Same Day Unit)

An extra test necessary for this study is the m easurement of the size of your radial artery (wrist 
artery) with a portable ultrasound device. This is a brief noninvasive test done b edside and 
involves no risk of injury or pain.  
WHAT  POSSIBLE  RISKS CAN I EXPECT FROM TAKING PART  IN 
THIS STUDY?  
There are minimal risks associated with this study such as a drop in your blood pressure  and 
headache . The drop in blood pressure should be mild and easily reversed with removal of the 
medication and or administration of intravenous  (IV) fluids. The risk of drop in blood pressure is 
lower with topi[INVESTIGATOR_139175]  (directly

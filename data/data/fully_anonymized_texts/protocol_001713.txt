 3  PROTOCOL Version 1.3 (See Table of Amendments)  Multi-Center Randomized Controlled Trial of Refeeding in Anorexia Nervosa    1. Introduction  Current recommendations to guide the clinical care of AN patients hospi[INVESTIGATOR_383797]/or clinical experience. No studies to date have prospectively tested high calorie refeeding (HCR) and the long-term impact on recovery is unknown. Consensus has developed over recent decades that patient safety can only be guaranteed using low calorie refeeding (LCR). The entrenchment of clinical practice without supporting evidence is a widely recognized dilemma in healthcare. While RCTs are considered the “gold standard” to establish evidence-based medicine, until recently there was insufficient data to propose such a study of refeeding in AN. We now have preliminary findings to indicate that LCR might be too cautious and that HCR appears feasible and may improve long-term recovery. Thus, we are poised to compare these two treatments in a parallel, randomized fashion.  2. Study Design  The purpose of this multi-center randomized controlled trial is to compare LCR vs. HCR refeeding strategies for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_383798]. Participants will be recruited upon hospi[INVESTIGATOR_383799] (UCSF and Stanford) to maximize sample size, and randomly assigned 1:[ADDRESS_480352] a meaningful difference in clinical remission (Aim 1A).  2.1. Study Population   a. Inclusion/Exclusion: Adolescents hospi[INVESTIGATOR_383800]. Inclusion criteria: diagnosis of AN, atypi[INVESTIGATOR_383801], age 12-24 years, no hospi[INVESTIGATOR_383802], and meet hospi[INVESTIGATOR_383803] (daytime HR < 50 bpm or night time HR < 45 bpm, BP <90/45 mmHg, temperature < 35.6° C or orthostasis defined by [CONTACT_383834] > 35 bpm or decrease in systolic BP > 20 mmHg from lying to standing). Exclusion criteria: diagnosis of bulimia nervosa [DSM-5], currently in remission (as defined by [CONTACT_383835]-Q score per Aim 1), admission for food refusal without malnutrition, current pregnancy, chronic disease (e.g. immune/endocrine disorders, pulmonary, cardiac, or renal disease), current suicidality or psychosis.  b. Participant recruitment and consent: Participants and their parents will sign assent (for those < 18 yr) and consent, respectively within [ADDRESS_480353] for future research projects. If a participant turns 18 yr while enrolled, s/he will be reconsented. Participants 18 years of age and older are able to consent themselves; thus we will request verbal consent from their parents to complete parent surveys.    
 4 2.2. Randomization  Participants will be stratified by [CONTACT_383836] 1:1 to the two intervention strategies within 24 hr of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063]. The Data Coordination Center (DCC) will provide a secure unpredictable allocation sequence (e.g. A B B A …) which will be programmed into a secure electronic study tracking system for assignment of each accrued participant. The sequences will be generated using block size of two to four to maximize balance between arms throughout accrual while ensuring the sequences remain unpredictable. As patients consent to study participation, clinical-research staff will assign the next available study ID number in sequence, identify the allocated intervention arm, and inform participants and their families of the assignment. In turn, the clinical research staff will provide the linked study ID number and Medical Record Number to the DCC, which will store this Personal Health Information in a HIPAA-compliant manner along with the intervention assignment.    3. Study Procedures  3.1. Treatment and Follow-up  a. Study groups: Upon randomization, the Lower Calorie Refeeding (LCR) group will begin with 1400 kcal per day; Higher Calorie Refeeding (HCR) group will commence at [ADDRESS_480354] adequately demonstrated that a 1200 kcal diet produces initial weight loss and therefore do not feel it is ethical to assign participants to this treatment. We chose 1400 kcal to start because in our previously study of LCR, weight loss ceased on day 3 in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_383804] 1411(299) kcal were prescribed. Diet prescriptions will increase by 200 kcal every other day in LCR and 200 kcal per day in HCR until a target level is reached. Target kcal are calculated upon admission as percent of energy needs using Estimated Energy Requirement (EER) equations from the Institute of Medicine. These equations are used clinically to set goals for caloric advancement although they are known to underestimate energy needs in patients with anorexia. Therefore, we maximize these estimations by [CONTACT_383837] (rather than current weight), a moderate activity factor of 1.2-1.3 (despi[INVESTIGATOR_383805]), and additional 500 kcal (if current weight < the MBMI).  b. Intervention (refeeding protocols): During hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], participants will follow a meal-based refeeding protocol that calls for eating three meals and three snacks per day, served on trays at the bedside, in the presence of ‘Room Sitters’. The calorie level of the diet will be prescribed by [CONTACT_383838][INVESTIGATOR_383806]. The study PI (Garber) will work with the Research Registered Dietitian (RD) and nutrition staff at both sites to ensure that menu selections fit the general macronutrient distribution of 30-40% fat, 15-25% protein and 35-55% carbohydrate. Menus will be continually analyzed (Software v.17.9.5, Computrition, Inc., Chatsworth, CA) to ensure conformance to this distribution as menu items are added or change over time. Dietetic Technicians will keep daily calorie counts, per Standard of Care (SOC), showing actual kcal consumed from food and formula.  A high energy liquid supplement (“formula”) providing 1.5 kcal per mL (360 kcal per 240 mL can) will be used orally as needed to replace kcal refused in meals or snacks per a standard calorie replacement protocol. We previously reported a greater than 98% concordance between kcal prescribed and actual kcal ingested using this method, as well as an equal proportion of kcal intake from formula in LCR and HCR groups. This finding supports our clinical observation that HCR meals can be completed without additional reliance on drinking formula. However, most AN patients do experience discomfort during refeeding and therefore all participants will receive SOC meal support including emotional support and techniques such as distraction. All beverages will be weighed and measured before placement on the tray, with a 1.5 L per day free water restriction. Room sitters will observe intake of all meals/snacks and remain in the room for 45 min afterwards. 
 5  c. Monitoring of electrolytes: Blood for electrolytes will be obtained between [ADDRESS_480355] week, electrolytes will be monitored every other day starting on day 8 unless there is continued evidence of abnormalities.   d. Correction of electrolyte abnormalities: Electrolyte abnormalities (serum phosphorus < 3 mg/dL, magnesium ≤ 1.7 mg/dL, or potassium < 3.5 mEq/L) will be corrected with a standardized protocol for both sites. Patients with hypophosphatemia will be treated with sodium potassium phosphate, 250 mg per packet (8 mmol phosphorus, 7.1 mEq potassium), one packet three times a day by [CONTACT_5555] a serum phosphorus between 2.5 and 2.9 mg/dL, two packets (500 mg) three times a day for a serum phosphorus of 2.0 - 2.5 mg/dL, and if serum phosphorus is < 2.0 mg/dL then intravenous sodium potassium phosphorus will be initiated at a dose of 0.24 mmol/kg (max of 15 mmol per dose). The PI[INVESTIGATOR_383807] 4 hours after the infusion is completed. Those with hypomagnesemia will be prescribed magnesium oxide (150 mg elemental Mg per tablet), one tablet three times a day by [CONTACT_5555] a serum magnesium between 1.3-1.7 mg/dL; two tablets three times a day by [CONTACT_5555] a serum magnesium between 1.0-1.2 mg/dL. In the case of serum magnesium below 1.0 mg/dL, the PI[INVESTIGATOR_383808], and intravenous magnesium sulfate will be started at a dose of 50 mg/kg (max of 2 grams per dose). Labs will be rechecked STAT 2 hours after infusion completed: If repeat serum mag still < 1.0 mg/dL, repeat same dose of magnesium sulfate IV; If repeat serum mag > 1.0, begin PO Mag, at PO dose indicated above. Those with hypokalemia will be prescribed extended release potassium chloride by [CONTACT_1966], 20 mEq for a serum potassium of 3.1-3.4 mmol/L; and 40 mEq for a serum potassium of 2.5-3.0 mmol/L. For a serum potassium between 2.2 - 2.5 mmol/L, 40 mEq extended release potassium chloride will be given STAT and the PI[INVESTIGATOR_383808]. Labs will be rechecked in 4 hours (peak) and 12 hours (estimated nadir). For any serum value of potassium < 2.2 mmol/L, intravenous potassium chloride will be initated and PI[INVESTIGATOR_383809]. Declining electrolyte levels that are in the normal range will not be treated.   Participants will also receive a SOC supplement regimen including 500mg elemental calcium with vitamin D twice per day and an adult multivitamin with minerals once per day.  e. Study time points: Participants will be followed prospectively in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_383810]. Patients will be discharged when medically stable, with the primary criterion of heart rate ≥ [ADDRESS_480356] 24 hr. Full medical stability defined as HR ≥ 45 bpm for 24 hrs, temperature ≥ 35.6ºC for 24 hrs, ≥ 75% of mBMI, BP ≥ 90/45 mmHg for 24 hrs or if systolic BP < 90 then asymptomatic and all else stable, orthostatic change in HR ≤ 35 bpm or if > 35 then asymptomatic and all else stable; and orthostatic change in SBP ≤ 20 mmHg or if > 20 then asymptomatic and all else stable.

Data Collection  Other than the treatment we are testing (HCR vs. LCR), patients will receive SOC in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. Thus, as shown in Table 1, the vast majority of procedures in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_383811]. Follow-up visits, on the other hand, are for the purpose of collecting data and will be scheduled at the designated time points.   a. Baseline data collection: The following covariates will be collected upon admission, prior to randomization. (1) Demographics and eating disorder history: an intake form will be self-administered (with study coordinator as proctor, 15 min) to assess: highest body weight, lowest body, date of onset (to calculate length of illness and rapi[INVESTIGATOR_383812]), family history of eating disorder, self-reported race/ethnicity, maternal education and zipcode (to indicate socioeconomic status), date of birth. (2) Eating Disorder Examination-Questionnaire (EDE-Q): is a standardized research interview that measures eating disorders psychopathology. [CONTACT_383853] (co-I, UCSF) has used this tool extensively in RCTs examining psychotherapeutic modalities and long-term recovery in AN and BN and to categorize lower and higher risk study participants. He will oversee the psychological aspects of this study, including the EDE-Q. (3) Food recall: dietary intake for the day prior to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_383813] a 24-hr food recall by [CONTACT_383839] (NDS-R) for total kcal and macronutrient profile. Dietary Density (DDS) and Variety Scores (DVS) will be calculated since acceptance of more energy dense and variety of foods in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_383814] 8 mo. (4) Severity of illness: %mBMI and HR on admission (5) Health Care Utilization and Missed School (HCUMS) Survey: This proctored interview draws from established tools to assess cost, and has been tailored for AN and integrated with the follow-up form (above). In addition to to “other care”, it assesses health care utilization in the [ADDRESS_480357].    b. Data collection daily in Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]:   (1) SOC in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]: Participants will be followed daily in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. Consistent with SOC for these patients, night time HR will be assessed with continuous cardiac monitoring throughout hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408], temperature will be measured orally and BP will be measured every 4-8 hr. Postural changes will be assessed with supi[INVESTIGATOR_6358] (after 5 min), followed by [CONTACT_383840] (after 2 min). When multiple vital signs measures are taken per protocol during one hospi[INVESTIGATOR_383815], the most deviant value (lowest HR, lowest BP, greatest increase in HR and greatest decrease in BP on orthostatic changes, lowest Temp) will be recorded. Weight is measured every morning upon waking after voiding on an electronic scale, with the subject wearing only a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_105463]. Height will be measured within 24 hours of admission with wall-mounted stadiometer. Electrolytes will be monitored per SOC as described above in 3.1.c.  (2) Study in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]: Participants at both sites will complete the questionnaires above.  c. Data collection during follow-up: Participants will return for five study follow-up visits through [ADDRESS_480358]-discharge and complete the following procedures:   (1) Anthropometrics and vital signs: Height, weight and vital signs will be measured according to the in-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_383816]. Vital sign measures will be taken after a 20-min rest to minimize the influence of activity required to attend the visit (e.g. walk from car). After resting, vital signs will be measured in the research center with standard, calibrated equipment and with postural changes according to the procedure above. Data will be entered directly into the electronic data capture system with fillable and constrained sections for anthropometric measures and vital signs to minimize error.  (2) Food recall: dietary intake for one full day during the week of each follow-up visit will be assessed with a 24-hr food recall by [CONTACT_383841]. (3) HCUMS Survey: As described above, this proctored survey will assess utilization of health care such as re-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_383817]-related hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], participation in eating disorder treatment programs, medications, missed school, missed work, and other direct and indirect costs associated with eating disorder care since the time of each prior follow-up visit. The HCUMS will document medications pertinent to recovery measures (menses and psychopathology), including medications, current mental health care, other medical and psychological/psychiatric care (“other care”) outside of our medical centers (e.g. residential care, psychiatric hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]). Psychotherapy modality and adherence may be important prognostic covariates of long-term outcomes in this open follow-up study.  3.3. Safety  This study begins with a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_383818]. Patients will be admitted to the adolescent medicine service if they are deemed medically unstable per published criteria. Once admitted, patients will be eligible for study enrollment. The treatment (HCR or LCR) is limited to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]. Aside from the questionnaires at both sites and daily (instead of every other day) electrolyte monitoring, all hospi[INVESTIGATOR_383819]. After discharge, participants will be followed openly. They are required to be under a physician’s care to ensure medical stability but not required to receive that care from us (however many do). Many patients have a psychiatrist to manage psychiatric co-morbidities such as anxiety and depression. If they receive care or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_383820]-up form.   a. Prospective monitoring of AEs:  Aim 2 specifies three electrolyte abnormalities that will be monitored prospectively in all participants and documented as described in 3.1.c.&d.: hypophosphatemia (<3 mg/dL), 2B) hypomagnesaemia (≤1.7 mg/dL), and 2C) hypokalemia (<3.5 mEq/L).  b. Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB):  As a multi-center clinical trial comparing treatments, the proposed study is required to have a DSMB according to the NICHD policy for clinical research monitoring. The purpose of the DSMB is to ensure the safety of participants and validity of the trial. We will draft a DSM Plan using the NICHD template.    
 8 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS PLAN (most recent change May 26, 2019) Multi-Center Randomized Controlled Trial of Refeeding in Anorexia Nervosa   1. Aims and Objectives   Our study has three main aims. We will compare:  AIM 1: Efficacy of LCR vs. HCR. We hypothesize that LCR and HCR will differ by [CONTACT_383842]: (1A) clinical remission during 12 mo follow-up, defined by [CONTACT_383843] (i) weight ≥ 95% median BMI (MBMI) for age and sex, and (ii) Eating Disorder Examination-Questionnaire (EDE-Q) global score within 1 SD of clinical norm, and (1B) medical stability during initial hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], defined by [CONTACT_383844].   AIM 2: Safety of LCR vs. HCR during initial hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. We hypothesize that LCR and HCR will not differ by [CONTACT_283863]: 2A) hypophosphatemia (<3 mg/dL), 2B) hypomagnesaemia (≤1.7 mg/dL), and 2C) hypokalemia (<3.5 mEq/L).  AIM 3: Cost-effectiveness (CE) of LCR vs. HCR. We hypothesize that HCR will be more cost-effective than LCR, as determined by [CONTACT_225437] (including costs of initial and re-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], 12 mo follow-up, other care, and safety/adverse events (AEs) and effectiveness per adolescent recovered (defined in AIM 1A and B).  2. Statistical Methods  2.1. Pool of participants   a.  Projected pool of eligible participants and accrual rate: At Stanford, in 2012 there were 295 admissions to the dedicated inpatient eating disorders unit, with approximately 36% of patients meeting DSM-4 criteria for AN; [ADDRESS_480359] 40% of patients ([ADDRESS_480360] and 40 at UCSF) will be eligible. Of those who are eligible, we estimate that at least 50% will agree to participate and thus we will not attempt to achieve equal enrollment across sites. We will accrue 3-4 participants per mo over 3 yr until N=120 is reached and retain 85% of this sample through 12 mo as shown in open follow-up studies of participants with AN. b.  Commitments of Site PIs, Research Teams, and Participants: Both site PIs have successfully recruited and retained AN participants in research projects and seen them to completion and publication. Furthermore, co-I Cheng is a faculty biostatistician with extensive experience in clinical trials. She will lead the DCC, aiming to ensure the trial is designed, executed, and analyzed without bias. Patient incentives to participate will emphasize the value of their contributions to medical research and remuneration for their time. c. Data Analyses:  Sample Description: The study sample will be summarized and described (e.g., mean ± SD) by [CONTACT_383845]-up (e.g., length of stay, last visit).  2.2. Outcomes  The primary analysis of the study adopts a modified intent-to-treat (mITT) approach to compare outcomes between randomized HCR and LCR participants who received treatment for at least one day. Patients who are ineligible post randomization, provide no assent after parent’s consent, or withdraw before receiving any treatment, will not be included in the mITT analysis for reasons of data unavailability, ethics and clinical relevance. Sensitivity analyses will be conducted to check that 1) withdrawal patients are not different from patients in both groups included in mITT in baseline covariates; and 2) including withdrawal patients in the analyses will not change results and conclusion of mITT analyses. The sensitivity analyses will provide us 
 9 reassurance of mITT results.   Aim 1A: Primary (long-term) efficacy outcome. A (generalized) linear mixed-effects regression model (GLMM) will compare study arms with respect to achievement and maintenance of clinical remission. Clinical remission is defined as the combination of mBMI and EDE-Q score at mo 1,3,6,12 (separate analyses below) and measured at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months as 1) clinically remitted (yes or no) and 2) weight recovered (percent of mBMI). The models will include time, treatment group, time*treatment group interaction, and unbalanced baseline covariates if any as fixed effects, while sites and patients will be included as random effects to account for the correlation due to clustering. The time*treatment group interaction provides mITT effect of HCR compared to LCR on clinical remission over time. The average remission rates and scores and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) will be estimated from the model. GLMM accounts for the fluctuating nature of mBMI and EDE-Q in AN and uses all available data with missing at random assumption, instead of a stronger assumption of missing completely at random required in other models. Aim 1 models will be supplemented with secondary analyses: (i) potential moderators at baseline (included in regression models as main effects and interactions with period and time), may include DSM-5 criteria and EDE-Q thresholds of risk and (ii) potential mediators at follow-up (included as time-dependent covariates), may include food recall (DDS and DVS), healthcare utilization, or incidence of AEs. In addition, separate mixed-effects models will analyze continuous versions of mBMI and EDE-Q to describe longitudinal trajectories.  Aim 1B: Secondary (short-term) efficacy outcome: Time to restore and maintain medical stability in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_383821]. A six-point index will adjudicate daily medical stability: 1.) 24-hour heart rate (HR) ≥ 45 bpm, 2.) systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥ 90 mmHg, 3.) temperature ≥ 35.6° C, 4.) orthostatic increase in HR ≤ 35 bpm, 5.) orthostatic decrease in systolic BP ≤ 20 mmHg, and 6.) ≥ 75% of mBMI. Each of the six criteria were scored as “1” if met, “0” if unmet and missing (not scored) if not measured. Medical stability was considered restored when all criteria were stable for 24 hours, allowing a maximum of two missing values (i.e. participants were considered stable if meeting 4 of 4, 5 of 5 or 6 of 6 measured criteria). All randomized participants who receive at least one day of treatment, including those who withdraw at any time during the refeeding intervention, will be included in the mITT analysis. Specifically, survival analysis with log rank test will compare time to achieve medical stability by [CONTACT_383846]; participants who do not meet stability criteria by [CONTACT_2360][INVESTIGATOR_383822]-censored. In case of any important unbalanced covariate at baseline, Cox proportional hazard ratio model will be used to control for the potential bias due to the confounder. Additionally efficacy outcomes will include the proportion achieving medical stability in each arm, change in %mBMI as compared to baseline, and time to restore HR.   Aim 2. Safety:  Primary indicator of safety will be incidence of the following electrolyte abnormalities during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]: 2A) hypophosphatemia (<3 mg/dL), 2B) hypomagnesaemia (≤1.7 mg/dL), 2C) hypokalemia (< 3.5 mEq/L). These AEs will be tracked, recorded, reported to the DSMB for monitoring, and to the IRB and NIH as needed, according to the attached DSMP. Incidence of the electrolyte abnormalities and proportion receiving supplementation to correct electrolyte abnormalities will be compared by [CONTACT_383847][INVESTIGATOR_383823]’s exact test. Additional safety outcomes: the proportion receiving electrolyte supplementation during the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_383824]’s exact test; time to electrolyte nadir will be compared with Wilcoxon rank sum test.  Aim 3. Cost Effectiveness (CE): A decision tree of treatment costs, AEs, health care utilized (including rehospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]), and remission will compare the CE between the two study arms. The main CE outcome is incremental cost per additional adolescent remitted. Health care utilization will be costed using national data sources such as acquisition costs for medications, Kids-HCUP for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], CPT codes for physician visits and mental health visits, and internet-based costs for lab tests. We will use [ADDRESS_480361] costs including missed school and workdays will be assessed and costed using national estimates of wages and salaries of this age group from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, in order to estimate loss of leisure time (school) or salary 
 10 
time (work). We will determine the incremental CE ratio (ICER) as: ICER = CostLCR-CostHCR/Number RecoveredLCR-Number RecoveredHCR.  Effectiveness will also be indicated by [CONTACT_383848][INVESTIGATOR_383825] (ie, rehospi[INVESTIGATOR_383826]-HCR). We will determine the net monetary benefit (NB) of each treatment option as: NB=Effectiveness X Willingness To Pay (WTP) – Cost. A positive difference in NB between treatments indicates CE. We will also calculate an acceptability curve to demonstrate how parameter uncertainty affects the likelihood of selecting the optimal treatment at a given WTP threshold. Cost of treatment will be determined by [CONTACT_383849][INVESTIGATOR_5478] 12 mo follow-up costs (not charges) including AEs and rehospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]. The HCUMS follow-up survey will assess indirect costs such as lost school and/or work (wages) using national data sources (see C.2.c.(2)).  Effectiveness will be determined per aim 1A; ICER will also use time (incremental cost per additional day of recovery time over 12 mo). Cost efficacy will be assessed with short-term outcomes at end of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. Per Aim 1B, cost-efficacy will be assessed with other short-term outcomes at the end of treatment (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_60521]). Cost-efficacy will be defined as hospi[INVESTIGATOR_383827]; group differences will be compared with Wilcoxon rank sum test.  2.3. Power and Sample-size Considerations  Aim 1. Based on studies of AN remission , Table 2.A shows that with N=[ADDRESS_480362] 80% power on 2-sided 0.05-level test to detect a 20% difference (8% vs. 28%) if data were cross-sectional (ρ=1). Our longitudinal data will allow detection of smaller effects, especially if the correlation among outcomes is low (ρ <0.8). We anticipate 85% retention and non-differential dropout by [INVESTIGATOR_216]. Since time to medical stability is also expected to differ by [CONTACT_2669] 12% (Table 2.B.), we will be adequately powered for Aim 1B.  2.4. Data Management  a. DCC: [CONTACT_253998] at UCSF will lead the DCC, which will be autonomous and independent of the clinical sites. It is housed in the UCSF Department of Preventive and Restorative Dental Sciences (PRDS). The department is staffed primarily by [CONTACT_383850]-intensive research, collaborative data collection and analyses from multiple sites. They are equipped with an independent network of sophisticated and reliable computer systems with high-level security for protecting health information. The network is maintained by [CONTACT_28920]-house computer staff, which manages all aspects of the network, including ongoing maintenance, installation and upgrades of hardware, software and structural components such as cabling and servers. [CONTACT_253998] is the lead biostatistician and routinely guides the work of Master-level statisticians, data managers and programmers. [CONTACT_253998] will continue as faculty biostatistician and DCC leader. She has extensive experience running NIDCR-funded DCCs for clinical trials with more than 8-10 sites nationwide. Thus, UCSF has experience maintaining a distinctly separate but closely coordinated working relationship between clinical sites and data center.  b.

 11 Capture (Qualtrics) system for databases, data entry forms, online questionnaires and data validation. Data will be automatically exported to STATA or SAS for analysis using The Data Export Utility. The DCC uses advanced features including branching logic for dynamic data entry form generation, file uploading, data importing, and embedded calculated database fields. c.    Confidentiality: Loss of confidentiality is a recognized risk of participating in clinical research since protected health information, medical history, and demographics are used for the study. Loss of privacy may lead to problems with insurability or social stigmatization. We will make effort to minimize this risk and have systems in place to ensure confidentiality. Data will be de-identified and thereafter handled by [CONTACT_79166], rather than by [CONTACT_2300]. No publications will include the names of patients or identifying information about study participants.  2.5. Retention and Attrition  We expect to retain 85% of our sample through one year of follow-up. This is consistent with other open follow-up studies of AN and feasible given our patients volumes and return rates. We will actively retain participants by [CONTACT_383851]: movie tickets upon enrollment and a $[ADDRESS_480363] models for baseline covariates that may be associated with loss to follow-up. We anticipate very few missing outcomes because weight and vital sign (medical stability) measures are SOC in AN care during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_383828]-up and the majority of patients hospi[INVESTIGATOR_383829]-up care. Reasons for refusal to participate will be collected from patients and families who decline enrollment.

This will ensure that time elapsed will be comparable among participants despi[INVESTIGATOR_383830].  1.2 3.2 Data Collection  Self-reported EDE-Q (5-10 minutes) will replace the lengthy interview-based EDE (60-90 minutes), based on recent evidence that it serves as a valid proxy for measuring severity of eating disorder psychopathology, with significant reduction in participant burden and personnel cost.

 13  Appendix Table 2. Amendments to the Statistical Analysis Plan*  * All amendments were made and documented prior to locking of database for analysis  Section changed  Amendment description & rationale   Amendment date & documentation 2.2 Outcomes Amendment 1: End-point for AIM 1B shortened to in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_383831]: To match the timeframe for the safety outcome and to better capture the efficacy of this relatively short intervention (less than 2 weeks in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]) within a long, open follow-up trial. Further, to allow timely dissemination of findings. [Citation: IOM guideline, Sharing Clinical Trial Data: Maximizing Benefits, Minimizing Risk, pg 118: Investigators “may publish the primary trial endpoints despi[INVESTIGATOR_383832]-term participant follow-up; in this case, the last participant’s last visit may not occur for some time, and hence the full analyzable data set may not be complete at the time of the original publication.”]  Timeframe for AIM 1B specified as [ADDRESS_480366]. Karen Winer approved analysis of short-term (in-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]) outcomes by [INVESTIGATOR_216] (DSMB notified 7/03/19, randomization code was broken)  Short-term database locked              06/30/2015  05/26/2019   07/31/2019 2.2 Outcomes  Amendment 2: Analytic approach for AIM 1B changed from mixed effects regression modeling to survival analysis  Rationale: survival analysis chosen to examine time to restore medical stability in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (amended AIM 1B), rather than mixed effects regression modeling to examine medical stability over 12-month follow-up. This is a more appropriate approach to assess “time to” outcome, which accounts for the variable lengths of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_383833]-censored.  Change in “time to” analysis documented in NIH Progress Report  Data Coordination Center documented decision to use survival analyses for AIM 1B             05/05/2017  10/17/2017  2.2 Outcomes Amendment 3: Analytic approach for AIM 2 (safety) changed from Cox regression modeling to basic non-parametric testing   Rationale: Originally planned approach (Cox regression models) assumed high incidence electrolyte abnormalities based on prior studies reporting rates up to 48%. However, ongoing AE monitoring during the trial revealed very low incidence and therefore basic parametric methods were chosen to allow clinical interpretation of the results.

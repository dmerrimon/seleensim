Version date: [ADDRESS_75521] prevalent gynecologic tumor in women, with an estimated 
43,470 cases and 7,950 deaths in the [LOCATION_002] in 2010 (1). Uterine serous papi[INVESTIGATOR_10928] 
(USPC) is an aggressive variant of endometrial cancer (2). Although it accounts for less than 10% 
of all endometrial tumors, it accounts for a disproportionate number of relapses and endometrial 
cancer-related deaths (2).  USPC, referred to as a Type II endometrial cancer, is characterized by a 
high-grade, complex histology and is biologically more aggressive than its type I counterpart, 
endometrioid adenocarcinoma (2).  Type I and II endometrial cancers appear to have a different 
pattern of molecular alterations that underlie pathogenesis and progression. While endometrioid 
carcinomas tend to have alterations in the tumor suppressor gene, PTEN, these are uncommon in 
USPC, with p53 mutations and HER2/ neu expression occurring more commonly in this tumor 
subtype (3). Both early-stage (Stage I/II with disease confined to the uterus) and advanced disease 
states (Stage III/IV with metastases present outside of the uterus) behave aggressively. USPC has a 
tendency to invade the lymphatic and vascular spaces and lymph nodes and to microscopi[INVESTIGATOR_69083], despi[INVESTIGATOR_69084]. These tumor characteristics lead to high recurrence rates and a poor prognosis for 
patients (2-5).
Because of  poor results with surgery alone, both radiation therapy and chemotherapy have been 
added postoperatively in an effort to improve outcomes (5).  However, the benefit of these 
modalities as well as the optimal treatment for each disease stage remains unclear. Our research 
group recently reported on the largest series of Stage I/II USPC patients in the literature and 
demonstrated a significant improvement in recurrence rates, progression free and overall survival 
in patients treated with carboplatin/paclitaxel-based regimens (6). Specifically, all 
carboplatin/paclitaxel +/-RT-treated patients had a lower risk of recurrence (9.2%) compared to 
radiation-only-treated (24.2%, p=0.04) and observed patients after surgery (30.2%, p=0.004). On 
multiple logistic regression analyses, adjuvant treatment strategy (p=0.036) and sub-stage 
(p=0.003) were significantly associated with recurrence. Five-year progression-free (p=0.009) and 
overall survival (p=0.012) were again highest in chemotherapy treated patients when compared to 
RT-treated and OBS patients. 
Recurrence rates  in women diagnosed with advanced stage disease are much higher than for early-
stage disease, with rates of 50-90% reported in published studies (7-11). These recurrences are often 
extra-pelvic and largely unsalvageable and highlight the need for effective systemic therapy in the 
treatment of this disease. Goff and colleagues reported that 72% of surgically staged USPC patients 
will have advanced-stage disease (extra-uterine, Stage III-IV) at the time of initial laparotomy (10). 
GOG #33 demonstrated that para-aortic nodal disease was more common in patients with USPC 
tumors, and GOG #94 demonstrated that in Stage III/IV UPSC patients treated with whole abdominal 
radiation, the majority of failures were multisite and extrapelvic (with distant failures not being 
uncommon) (9). These findings indicate that radiation therapy alone has a limited role in the 
management of USPC.  It has been suggested that USPC tumors more closely resemble ovarian 
cancers than endometrial cancers. The high rates of intra-abdominal disease spread and intra-
abdominal failures reported support this concept, and have led to the use of ovarian cancer-based 
chemotherapy regimens as treatment.  As more effective chemotherapeutic agents have been 
identified in endometrial cancer, combination regimens have demonstrated improved responses, and

superiority to radiation alone (GOG #122) (11).
Chemotherapy, either alone or  in combination with radiotherapy, has been evaluated in the 
management of advanced-staged endometrial cancer. As USPC is a rare tumor subtype, it is often 
grouped with more common endometrial tumor subtypes (ie, endometrioid adenocarcinoma) in 
prospective treatment studies. However, studies suggest that USPC patients tend to fare worse and 
may exhibit more heterogeneity of response to chemotherapy than their counterparts with less 
aggressive subtypes (2-5). Therefore, there is potential benefit in studying UPSC as its own clinical 
entity. 
In terms  of the relevant studies on advanced-stage endometrial cancer—many of which included 
USPC patients—there are several reports that help guide management. Burke reported on 62 patients 
with high-risk endometrial cancer (21% with USPC or CC histologies) treated with cisplatin, 
adriamycin, and cyclophosphamide following surgical staging (12). Three-year survival was 82% in 
patients without extra-uterine disease. Levenback described 20 patients with all stages of USPC 
treated with the same regimen and reported a 5-year survival of 23% (13). Paclitaxel has demonstrated 
significant activity in endometrial cancer patients with advanced or recurrent disease in two GOG 
phase II studies (GOG 86-O, 129-C) (14-15). The combination of cisplatin and adriamycin versus 
cisplatin, adriamycin and paclitaxel (TAP) was then studied in GOG #177, a Phase III trial of primary, 
advanced-stage endometrial cancer patients with superior progression-free and overall survival 
outcomes noted in the TAP cohort (16).  TAP is currently being evaluated sequentially with radiation 
in GOG-184, and is also being compared to paclitaxel/carboplatin in GOG-209, a Phase III 
equivalence study, in the same cohort of patients. 
Paclitaxel has  also demonstrated activity specifically in USPC tumors as reported by [CONTACT_69140] M.D. Anderson Cancer Center (17). They reported a 77% objective response rate in 
a small series of patients with advanced disease. Hoskins reported experience using paclitaxel and 
carboplatin with and without radiation in 63 patients with advanced and recurrent endometrial cancer. 
In a subgroup of 15 patients with advanced USPC tumors, the response rate was 60%, and 2 out of 4 
patients with recurrent disease responded to the regimen (18). Carboplatin has demonstrated 
comparable activity to cisplatin in most gynecologic malignancies, including endometrial cancer (19-
20). Substituting carboplatin for cisplatin appears to reduce toxicity and increase ease of 
administration (21-25).
A recent  Phase II pi[INVESTIGATOR_69085] “sandwiched” between platinum/taxane-
based therapy in Stage I-IV USPC patients demonstrated that this regimen had excellent antitumor 
activity, but the majority of patients with advanced disease recurred during the three year study period 
(21). Phase III GOG data on advanced/recurrent endometrial cancers of all subtypes have 
demonstrated median progression-free survival (PFS) rates of 7-8 months and median overall survival 
(OS) rates of 15 months, despi[INVESTIGATOR_69086]/taxane-based chemotherapy (16). Finally, 
two recent Phase III studies from the Japanese Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) and 
NSGO/EORTC, respectively demonstrated that patients with high-risk, early-stage endometrial 
cancers treated with chemoradiation had improved progression-free and overall survival when 
compared to patients treated with radiation therapy alone. Patients with USPC were included in these 
trials (26-27).
In addition  to platinum/taxane-based chemotherapy, another reasonable approach to the treatment of 
USPC may lie in targeted therapy. Several studies have demonstrated that the human epi[INVESTIGATOR_69087] 5/6/2020

growth factor  receptor 2 gene (HER2, also known as c- erbB2 and HER2/ neu), is over-expressed in 
18 to 80% of USPC and may contribute to USPC transformation and tumorigenesis (28-35).  In some 
of these studies, HER-2/ neu overexpression has been identified as an independent variable associated 
with poor outcome in USPC patients, and one that occurs more frequently in African-American women 
than in Caucasian women (32,33). In a single institution study of 26 USPC samples evaluated by [CONTACT_69141], 62% exhibited HER2/ neu overexpression (34). Protein overexpression and gene amplification 
were found to correlate in 100% (9/9) of the 3+ positive tumors but in only 2/7 (29%) of the 2+ 
positive tumors (34). Consistent with these results, in a recent exploratory immunohistochemical 
analysis of HER-2/neu  expression in advanced endometrial carcinoma performed by [CONTACT_69142], HER-
2/neu overexpression [either 2+ (moderate) or 3+ (strong)] was detected in 23 of 38 (61%) of the 
USPC tested in a centralized core lab facility (35). High HER-2/ neu expression levels in USPC have 
also been reported by [CONTACT_69143]-Montez et al. (36), with 12 of the 25 (48%) USPC cases in the John 
Hopkins’ series demonstrating HER-2/neu overexpression. Of interest, in this study, a significant 
association of HER-2/neu overexpression with surgical staging was detected, with 81.8% advanced 
stage disease vs. 28.6% early stage disease showing HER-2/ neu overexpression (36). Taken all 
together, these results raise the possibility of therapeutic strategies that target HER2, such as using 
the anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody trastuzumab (Herceptin) may have significant therapeutic 
potential in USPC patients harboring advanced and/or recurrent disease.
Results from  large randomized clinical trials for patients with HER-[ADDRESS_75523] cancer recurrence when compared with patients who received 
the same chemotherapy without trastuzumab (37). Importantly, clinical responses to trastuzumab used 
as single agent in breast cancer patients are reported on the order of 10-15%, while the overall 
response rate to trastuzumab in combination with chemotherapeutic agents may increase in the same 
patient populations to > 50% (37). On the basis of these results, a significantly higher clinical activity 
of trastuzumab when used in combination with chemotherapy may be expected in USPC patients 
harboring advanced and/or recurrent disease over expressing HER2/neu. While previous studies in 
HER2/neu positive breast cancer have demonstrated improved efficacy of trastuzumab and paclitaxel 
with the addition of carboplatin, there are no studies in the literature evaluating combination 
platinum/taxane chemotherapy with trastuzumab in USPC patients.
A Phase  II study of single agent trastuzumab in advanced/recurrent endometrial cancer patients of 
any histology has recently been reported from the GOG (38). This study was not able to demonstrate 
single agent activity of trastuzumab against endometrial carcinoma patients harboring tumors with 
HER2/neu overexpression. Such results, however, have been recently challenged due to the many 
shortcomings in the design of the GOG181b study (39). Moreover, evidence of trastuzumab clinical 
activity in a handful of heavily pretreated endometrial carcinoma patients has been recently reported 
as case reports in the medical literature (40-42).
Clinical efficacy  of trastuzumab has been postulated to depend on multiple direct or indirect action 
mechanisms that may produce cytostatic and/or cytotoxic antitumor cell effects. CD16 and natural 
killer (NK) cells appear to play a central role in mediating the anti-tumor effects of trastuzumab 
therapy, and an inherent resistance to trastuzumab has been noted in some HER2/neu positive breast 
cancer patients with specific polymorphisms of CD16 (43-44). To date, trastuzumab therapy and the 
immunologic basis for its putative activity (or inactivity) have not been studied in UPSC.

4.0  STUDY MODALITIES
             4.1 Chemotherapy
4.11  Paclitaxel (NSC #673089) 175 mg/m2 will be administered intravenously 
every [ADDRESS_75537] would receive clinical benefit from continued 
chemotherapy treatment.
4.12  Formulation: Paclitaxel is a poorly soluble plant product from the western 
yew, Taxus brevifolia . Improved solubility requires a mixed solvent system 
with further dilutions of either 0.9% sodium chloride or 5% dextrose in water.
4.131  Supplier/How Supplied: Commercially available. A sterile solution 
concentrate, 6 mg/ml, in 5 ml vials (30 mg/vial) or 17 ml vials (100 mg/vial) 
in polyoxyethylated castor oil (Cremophor EL) 50% and dehydrated alcohol, 
USP, 50%. The contents of the vial must be diluted just prior to clinical use. 
4.132 Solution Preparation: Paclitaxel, at the appropriate dose, will be 
diluted in  500-1000 ml of 0.9% Sodium Chloride injection, USP or 5% 
Dextrose injection, USP (D5W) (500 mls is adequate if paclitaxel is a single 
agent). Paclitaxel must be prepared in glass or polyolefin containers due to 
leaching of diethylhexlphthalate (DEHP) plasticizer from polyvinylchloride 
(PVC) bags and intravenous tubing by [CONTACT_69147].
NOTE: Formation  of a small number of fibers in solution (within acceptable 
limits established by [CONTACT_69148]) has been 
observed after preparation of paclitaxel. Therefore, in-line filtration is 
necessary for administration of paclitaxel solutions. In-line filtration should 
be accomplished by [CONTACT_8246] a hydrophilic, microporous filter of pore 
size not greater than 0.22 microns (e.g.: IVEX-II, IVEX-HP or equivalent) 
into the IV fluid pathway distal to the infusion pump. Although particulate 
formation does not indicate loss of drug potency, solutions exhibiting 
excessive particulate matter formation should not be used.
4.133 Storage: The intact vials should be stored between 2-25°C (36-77°F).
4.134 Stability:  Commercially available paclitaxel will be labeled with an expi[INVESTIGATOR_69089]. All solutions of paclitaxel exhibit a slight haziness directly proportional 
to the concentration of drug and the time elapsed after preparation, although 
when prepared as described above, solutions of paclitaxel (0.3-1.2 mg/ml) are 
physically and chemically stable for 48 hours.

treatment.
[IP_ADDRESS] How  supplied: Trastuzumab, manufactured by [CONTACT_69151], 
is supplied as a freeze-dried preparation at a nominal content of 440 mg per vial for 
parenteral administration. This agent is formulated in histidine, trehalose, and 
polysorbate 20. Each vial of trastuzumab is packaged with one 30 ml vial of 
bacteriostatic water for injection, USP, 1.1% benzyl alcohol.
[IP_ADDRESS]             Preparation: Reconstitution with 20 ml of the supplied diluent provides a solution    
                        containing 21 mg/ml trastuzumab. The reconstituted solution is designed for multiple
                       uses and must be stored under refrigeration.  Reconstituted trastuzumab should be 
                       clear to slightly opalescent and colorless to pale yellow. The vial must be used within 
                       28 days after reconstitution. If a patient has a known allergy to benzyl alcohol, Sterile 
                      Water for injection without a preservative may be used. However, the reconstituted 
                     solution should be used immediately and the unused portion discarded.  Provided     
                     below are directions for reconstituting each vial of trastuzumab:
Using a  sterile syringe, slowly inject 20 ml of the supplied diluent (or sterile 
water, if appropriate) into the vial. The stream of diluent should be directed 
into the lyophilized cake. Swirl the vial gently to aid reconstitution. 
Trastuzumab may be sensitive to shear-induced stress, e.g., agitation or rapid 
expulsion from a syringe.  DO NOT SHAKE. Vigorous handling of solutions 
of trastuzumab may result in aggregation of the protein and create cloudy 
solutions. Slight foaming of the product upon reconstitution is not unusual. 
Allow the vial to stand undisturbed for approximately 5 minutes. The 
solution should be essentially free of visible particles, clear to slightly 
opalescent and colorless to pale yellow.  Reconstituted trastuzumab should 
be further diluted in 250 ml of 0.9% Sodium Chloride for Injection, USP, 
prior to administration. Solutions for infusion prepared in polyvinylchloride 
(PVC) or polyethylene bags may be stored at 2-8° C (36-46° F) for up to 24 
hours prior to use. Dextrose 5% solution should not be used.
[IP_ADDRESS]              Administration: Trastuzumab is given by [CONTACT_69152]. A
typi[INVESTIGATOR_69091] 6 mg/kg administered every 21 days. The initial 
dose of 8 mg/kg is infused over 90 minutes. If this is well tolerated,

5.0 CORRELATIVE  STUDIES 
5.1 Immunohistochemistry  (IHC): Uterine or metastatic tumor sites will be 
collected at the time of primary staging surgery. The tumor will be processed and 
paraffin-embedded by a research technician in the surgical pathology department.  
Archival tumoral tissue or tumor cells isolated from ascites will be studied in patients 
with recurrent disease that do not go to surgery.  The Dako Hercep test will be 
performed as initial evaluation for HER2/neu  protein over-expression in USPC 
samples.  Membranous staining for HER2/neu will be scored according to the Dako 
Hercep test criteria and scored as 0, 1+, 2+, 3+ (45-48). Uterine serous tumors showing 
a 3 + positive screening test are eligible for enrollment. USPC samples showing 2+ 
positivity by [CONTACT_69153]2/ neu by [CONTACT_69154] (FISH) to be eligible for study enrollment. All IHC 
and FISH assays will be centrally reviewed in the Pathology Department at Yale 
University where confirmatory IHC and/or FISH review and/or testing will be 
performed. Patients will be allowed to initiate therapy prior to confirmation.
5.2 Fluorescence  in-situ hybridization (FISH):  Only the cases with 2+ 
membranous staining on IHC will be submitted to confirmatory FISH analysis based 
on a known correlation established in breast cancer and recent reports in USPC (34,46-
48). Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is regarded as the best diagnostic test 
for detecting HER-2/neu  amplification: it has high sensitivity (96.5%) and specificity 
(100%) for detecting amplification of HER-2/neu (45-48).  Fluorescence in situ 
hybridization (FISH) analysis will be performed on sections of paraffin-embedded 
tissue using dual-color DNA FISH probes. For the detection of HER2/neu 
amplification a Pathvysion LSI, Her-2 (17q11-12) probe labeled with Spectrum 
Orange will be used in combination with a CEP 17 centromeric probe labeled with 
Spectrum Green (Abbott) as previously reported by [CONTACT_69155]., (34).
Of note: as concordance between HER2/neu protein expression by [CONTACT_69156] (3+) but gene amplification is negative, we shall 
use IHC as the gold standard test to determine patient eligibility to 
trastuzumab therapy.

Do not perform MUGA/ECHO unless patient is randomized to Trastuzumab 
arm of study.
6.12 Treatment  Plan
This is  a two arm, randomized Phase II design with HER2/neu+ 
advanced/recurrent USPC disease. Patients with USPC meeting eligibility 
criteria will undergo immunohistochemistry for HER2/neu expression and/or 
fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to detect amplified HER2/ neu gene 
expression. 
6.121 HER2/ neu+: Patients who have HER2/neu positive disease (i.e., 3+ USPC) 
by [CONTACT_69158]/or FISH + results will be randomized to receive six cycles of 
chemotherapy with carboplatin and paclitaxel with or without concurrent 
trastuzumab. They will also have peripheral blood drawn to perform in vitro 
studies to provide a basis for assessing the possible therapeutic contributions 
of immune mechanisms of action of trastuzumab.
The trastuzumab  shall be continued indefinitely in these patients until disease 
progression of prohibitive toxicities occur.
6.122 CA-125  Exploratory Analysis: Of note, retrospective studies suggest
 that CA-125  may be a marker of active disease in women with USPC (49)  
Therefore, in an exploratory analysis, CA-125 will be drawn on 
each patient with  other labs prior to treatment, after each cycle and then at 3 
month intervals if remission is achieved.
6.123 Chemotherapy:  Carboplatin AUC 5 and Paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 (3 hours)

6.124.1 Methods  of Chemotherapy Administration
Maximum body  surface area used for dose calculations will be 2.0 m2 as per 
GOG Chemotherapy Procedures Manual.
6.124.2 Sequence and  timing of drug administration: Carboplatin will be 
administered as a 30 minute infusion.  Carboplatin will be infused after 
Paclitaxel.
6.124.3 Paclitaxel will  be administered as a 3-hour infusion on this study.  For all 
courses where paclitaxel is to be administered, it is recommended that a 
preparative regimen be employed to reduce the risk with hypersensitivity 
reactions. This regimen should include dexamethasone (either IV or PO), 
anti- histamine H1 (such as diphenhydramine) and anti-histamine H2 (such 
as cimetidine, ranitidine, or famotidine).
6.124.4 Antiemetic Regimens:  It is anticipated that nausea and vomiting may be a 
significant side effect of chemotherapy. The following representative 
antiemetic regimens are suggested: Ondansetron 8-32 mg IV 30 minutes 
prior to administration of chemotherapy and dexamethasone 10-20 mg IV 30 
minutes prior to drug administration, or Granisetron 10 mcg/kg IV (or 2 mg 
PO) 30 minutes prior to chemotherapy, with or without lorazepam 0.5-2.0 
mg IV 30 minutes prior to chemotherapy or aloxi 0.25 mg IV 30 minutes 
prior to chemotherapy.
6.124.5 Dosing  of Carboplatin
The dose will be  calculated to reach a target area under the curve (AUC) of 
concentration x time according to the Calvert formula using an estimated 
glomerular filtration rate (GFR) from the Cockcroft-Gault formula. The 
initial dose of carboplatin must be calculated using GFR.  Institutional 
guidelines should be followed when calculating carboplatin dose.
In patients  with an abnormally low serum creatinine (less than or equal to 0.7 
mg/dl), due to reduced protein intake and/or low muscle mass, the creatinine 
clearance should be determined using a minimum of 0.7 mg/dL.
Calvert Formula: Carboplatin dose (mg) = target AUC × (GFR +25)
For the purposes of this protocol, the GFR is considered to be
equivalent to the  creatinine clearance. The creatinine clearance (Ccr) is 
estimated by [CONTACT_26306]-Gault using the following formula:
Ccr=  [140-age(years)] x Weight (kg)x 0.85/(72 x Scr)
Where: Ccr = estimated creatinine clearance in ml/min
Age = patient's  age in years (from 20-80)
Scr = serum creatinine in mg/dl

Version date: [ADDRESS_75543] (CTC grade2), the dose of carboplatin will not be 
recalculated for subsequent cycles, but will be subject to dose modification 
for hematologic criteria and other events as noted.
The Maximum  GRF according to the new NCI recommendations to be used 
in the Calvert Formula should not exceed 125 ml/min.  Therefore, the 
maximum allowed dose of carboplatin is 750 mg (AUC 5).
6.124.6 Dosing  of Trastuzumab Therapy: 8 mg/kg of trastuzumab will be 
administered IV over a 90-minute period and on the same day as 
chemotherapy (but after the patient has received paclitaxel and carboplatin).

7.21.7 For recurrent febrile neutropenia, and/or recurrent documented grade 4 neutropenia 
persisting ≥7 days (after initial dose reduction), add prophylactic growth factors. In this 
circumstance, it is recommended that G-CSF at a dose of 5 microgram/kg/day* (or 
equivalent dosing of pegfilgrastim or sargramostim) will be administered subcutaneously 
starting the day after the last dose of chemotherapy (normally day 2-4) and continuing 
through hematopoietic recovery. Growth factors should not be used within [ADDRESS_75548] a 1 level dose reduction in the 
carboplatin only.
7.21.9 There will be no dose modifications on the basis of uncomplicated granulocyte
nadirs lasting less than 7 days.
7.3 Non-hematologic toxicity
7.31Neurotoxicity: Neurologic  Toxicity Grade 2 (at the discretion of the investigator) 
or Grade 3 or greater peripheral neuropathy requires discontinuation of protocol 
therapy until symptoms resolve to Grade 1.  When treatment is resumed the carboplatin 
dose should be reduced to an AUC of 4 and paclitaxel should be reduced to level B.  
The protocol regimen will be discontinued in patients with recurrent Grade 3 or any 
Grade 4 neurologic toxicity. 
7.32 Gastrointestinal  Adverse Effects: Grade 1-2 nausea/vomiting with chemotherapy 
or radiation therapy, and grade 1-2 diarrhea after radiation therapy may be expected.  
Patients may receive the investigator’s choice of drugs for the control of nausea and 
vomiting. Grade 4 gastrointestinal toxicity will require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_69093]. Stomatitis or diarrhea: If any mucositis is present on day 21 of a cycle, 
treatment should be withheld until the mucositis has returned to Grade 1. Grade 3 or 4 
mucositis or diarrhea; require a dose reduction of paclitaxel.
7.33 Genitourinary Adverse  Effects: Increased frequency with dysuria may occur in 
some patients.  This may be treated symptomatically with antispasmodics and 
increased fluid intake.  Urinary tract infection should be ruled out if the symptoms 
persist.
7.34 Adjustments  for Cardiac Toxicity: Asymptomatic bradycardia is not an indication 
for discontinuation of therapy.  However, the Paclitaxel infusion should be 
discontinued for chest pain, clinically significant arrhythmia, hypotension, or serious 
allergic reaction.  Any arrhythmia that is felt to necessitate discontinuation of 
Paclitaxel should be discussed with the Study Chair as soon as possible.

7.35 Dose  Adjustments for > Grade 3 Non-Hematologic Toxicity: Decrease Paclitaxel 
and Carboplatin combination one dose level, and resume treatments after recovery to 
< grade 1 toxicity.
7.36 Paclitaxel  hypersensitivity reaction: If hypersensitivity reactions to paclitaxel or 
its vehicle (Cremaphor) occur, it will usually be during the first few minutes of 
infusion.  Appropriate symptomatic therapy should be given.  Continued treatment 
may be considered if the reaction is not life-threatening; however, patients must be 
cautioned about potential recurrences of the reaction.  Should the patient decide to 
continue with treatment it is preferable that this be done on the same day of the 
occurrence. Patients will follow the institutional protocol for paclitaxel desensitation. 
A suggested procedure would be to administer the drug first with 1 ml of the original 
IV solution diluted in 100 ml over one hour, then 5 ml in 100 ml over one hour, then 
10 ml in 100 ml over one hour, and finally, the original solution at the original speed.  
7.37 Myalgias  in the several days following paclitaxel treatment may be severe, and 
should receive aggressive symptomatic treatment, including narcotics or steroids as 
required.  They are not, however, an indication for dose reduction.
7.38 Hepatic  toxicity: Bilirubin must return to within normal limits prior to further 
therapy. 
7.4 Trastuzumab:  Although patients will undergo routine monitoring during 
therapy, organ-specific toxicities that require dose modification are not 
anticipated with trastuzumab, and there are no provisions for dose reduction. 
As noted above, infusion duration may be lengthened at the discretion of the
 treating physician.
7.41 Therapy with trastuzumab should be discontinued in patients with any
new cardiac  symptoms or findings of cardiac dysfunction. Therapy should also 
be discontinued if the LVEF is documented to fall to a value ≤ 40% or decrease 
≥ 15 absolute percentage points, from baseline (for example, from a value of 
60% to 45%).
7.42 Criteria  for removal from trastuzumab treatment:
7.43 Inability to tolerate trastuzumab because of toxicity.
7.44 The patient may withdraw from the study at any time.
7.45 Patients with evidence of disease progression or significant side effects will  
             be removed from study treatment.
7.46 New cardiac toxicity as specified in exclusion criteria.

11.0 STUDY MONITORING AND REPORTING PROCEDURES 
11.1 Personnel responsible for the safety review and its frequency:
The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_22413], assuring protocol compliance, 
and conducting the safety reviews at the specified frequency which must be conducted at a 
minimum of every 6 months (including when reapproval of the protocol is sought).  During the 
review process, the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_69097], require modification/amendment, or close to 
enrollment. Either the principal investigator, the IRB or the Yale Cancer Center Data and Safety 
Monitoring Committee (DSMC) have the authority to stop or suspend the study or require 
modifications.
11.2 The risks associated with the current study are deemed moderate for the following 
reasons: 
1. We  do not view the risks associated with the Trastuzumab as minimal.
2. We  do not view the risks associated with the combined use of Carboplatin, Paclitaxel and 
Trastuzumab as minimal.
3. Given  the now established safety and validity of studies performed using Trastuzumab 
(FDA approved since September, 1998), we do not view the proposed study as high risk.
4. Given  our experience with the combined co-administration of Carboplatin, Paclitaxel and 
Trastuzumab, we do not view the proposed studies as high risk.
Although we have  assessed the proposed study as one of moderate risk, the potential exists for 
anticipated and/or unanticipated adverse events, serious or otherwise, to occur since it is not 
possible to predict with certainty the absolute risk in any given individual or in advance of first-
hand experience with the proposed study methods. Therefore, we provide a plan for monitoring the 
data and safety of the proposed study as follows:
11.3 Attribution of Adverse Events:
Adverse events will be monitored for each subject participating in the study and attributed to the 
study procedures / design by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Alessandro Santin , according to the 
following categories:
a.) Definite: Adverse event is clearly related to investigational procedures(s)/agent(s).
b.) Probable: Adverse event is likely related to investigational procedures(s)/agent(s).
c.) Possible: Adverse event may be related to investigational procedures(s)/agent(s).
d.) Unlikely: Adverse  event is likely not to be related to the investigational procedures(s)/agent(s).
e.) Unrelated: Adverse event is clearly not related to investigational procedures(s)/agent(s).

11.4 Plan for Grading Adverse Events:
The following scale will be used in grading the severity of adverse events noted during the study:
1. Mild adverse event
2. Moderate  adverse event
3. Severe  
11.5 Plan for Determining Seriousness of Adverse Events:
An adverse event may be graded as severe but still not meet the criteria for a Serious Adverse 
Event.  Similarly, an adverse event may be graded as moderate but still meet the criteria for an SAE.  
It is important for the PI [INVESTIGATOR_22415] “seriousness” when 
determining whether reporting to the IRB is necessary.
Refer to Section 12.0 of the protocol for guidelines
11.6 Plan for reporting Reportable Adverse Events and other unanticipated problems 
involving risks to subjects or others to the IRB
The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_22416]: a) adverse events 
that are serious or life-threatening AND unanticipated (or anticipated but occurring with a greater 
frequency than expected) AND possibly, probably or definitely related to the 
drug/device/intervention; and b)other unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others.
These adverse events or unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others will be 
reported to the IRB in accordance with IRB Policy 710, using the appropriate forms found on the 
website. This information is discussed in Section 12.0 of the protocol.
11.7 Plan for reporting adverse events to co-investigators on the study, as appropriate the 
protocol’s research monitor(s), e.g., industrial sponsor, Yale Cancer Center Data and Safety 
Monitoring Committee (DSMC), Protocol Review Committee (PRC), DSMBs, study sponsors,

Each reported AE or SAE will be described by [CONTACT_13662] (i.e., start and end dates), 
regulatory seriousness criteria if applicable, suspected relationship to the Trastuzumab  
(see following guidance), and actions taken.
To ensure consistency of AE and SAE causality assessments, investigators should apply the 
following general guideline:
Yes
There is a plausible temporal relationship between the onset of the AE and 
administration of the Trastuzumab and the AE cannot be readily explained by [CONTACT_1560]’s clinical state, intercurrent illness, or concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]; and/or the AE 
follows a known pattern of response to the Trastuzumab and/or the AE abates or 
resolves upon discontinuation of the Trastuzumab or dose reduction and, if 
applicable, reappears upon re-challenge.
No
Evidence exists that the AE has an etiology other than the Trastuzumab (e.g., 
preexisting medical condition, underlying disease, intercurrent illness, or 
concomitant medication); and/or the AE has no plausible temporal relationship to 
Trastuzumab administration (e.g., cancer diagnosed [ADDRESS_75560] dose of study 
drug).
Expected adverse events are those adverse events that are listed  or characterized in the Package 
Insert or current Investigator Brochure. 
Unexpected adverse events are those not listed in the Package Insert (P.I.) or current Investigator 
Brochure (I.B.) or not identified.  This includes adverse events for which the specificity or severity 
is not consistent with the description in the P.I. or I.B.  For example, under this definition, hepatic 
necrosis would be unexpected if the P.I. or I.B. only referred to elevated hepatic enzymes or 
hepatitis. Refer to Section 12.0 for further guidelines.

11.10.[ADDRESS_75562] medical terminology/concepts when reporting AEs or SAEs.  
Avoid colloquialisms and abbreviations.  All information will be recording using Oncore 
Clinical Trials Management System.
a. Diagnosis  vs. Signs and Symptoms
If known  at the time of reporting, a diagnosis should be reported rather than individual signs 
and symptoms (e.g., record only liver failure or hepatitis rather than jaundice, asterixis, and 
elevated transaminases).  However, if a constellation of signs and/or symptoms cannot be 
medically characterized as a single diagnosis or syndrome at the time of reporting, it is ok to 
report the information that is currently available.  If a diagnosis is subsequently established, 
it should be reported as follow-up information.
b. Deaths
All deaths that occur during the conduct of the research must be reported to the Yale 
Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_69099] (if possible) to 
ensure that all over site committees are properly informed.  All information will be entered 
into Oncore Clinical Trials Management System and updated appropriately.  Further 
determination regarding the need to submit to the subjects local IRB, Yale University HHRP 
following IRB Policy 710 for reporting Unanticipated Problems Involving Risk to Subjects 
and Genentech Drug Safety Committee will be reviewed. Specific information is outlined in

When recording a death, the event or condition that caused or contributed to the fatal 
outcome should be reported as the single medical concept.  If the cause of death is unknown 
and cannot be ascertained at the time of reporting, report “Unexplained Death”.
c. Preexisting  Medical Conditions
A preexisting medical condition is one that is present at the start of the study.  Such 
conditions should be reported as medical and surgical history.
A preexisting medical condition should be re-assessed throughout the trial and reported as 
an AE or SAE only if the frequency, severity, or character of the condition worsens during 
the study.  When reporting such events, it is important to convey the concept that the 
preexisting condition has changed by [CONTACT_9672] (e.g., “more frequent

Abortion, whether accidental, therapeutic, or spontaneous, should always be classified as 
serious, and expeditiously reported as an SAE.  Similarly, any congenital anomaly/birth 
defect in a child born to a female subject exposed to the Trastuzumab should be reported as 
an SAE.
f. Post-Study Adverse Events
The investigator should expeditiously report any SAE occurring after a subject has 
completed or discontinued study participation if attributed to prior Trastuzumab exposure.
If the  investigator should become aware of the development of cancer or a congenital 
anomaly in a subsequently conceived offspring of a female subject who participated in the 
study, this should be reported as an SAE.
g. Reconciliation   
The Sponsor agrees to conduct reconciliationfor the product.  Genentech and the Sponsor will agree 
to the reconciliation periodicity and format, but agree at minimum to exchange monthly line listings

advanced/recurrent UPSC patients, with  an emphasis on identifying and treating women having 
HER2/neu+ disease. The incidence of HER2/neu + USPC patients in the retrospective literature ranges 
from 18-80%. However, the percentage is known to increase with advancing stage, and most of these 
studies are small and are confounded by [CONTACT_69172]. In a recent GOG study of 
patients with largely advanced-stage USPC, HER2/neu expression rates (i.e., 2+ and 3+) were >60% 
(35). 
            With regard to  sample-size planning, almost 100% of recurrences in women with advanced-
stage disease will happen within the first two years after diagnosis. Based upon historical Phase III 
data of outcomes in advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer patients treated with platinum/taxane-
based therapy (median PFS=~7.0-8.0 months) and retrospective data on advanced stage USPC 
patients (median PFS ~6 months), we would anticipate a 6-month median PFS in patients treated with 
chemotherapy alone.
14.2 Primary objective
To estimate  whether the addition of trastuzumab to paclitaxel and carboplatin chemotherapy improves 
progression free survival (PFS) when compared to paclitaxel and carboplatin alone in USPC patients 
over expressing HER2/neu 
14.3 Secondary objectives
To assess objective response rate (ORR)
To assess overall survival (OS)
To assess the safety profile of Trastuzumab in USPC patients
14.4 Exploratory/correlative objectives
To determine peripheral  blood natural killer (NK) cell numbers and activity in HER2/ neu+ USPC 
patients to provide a basis for assessing the possible therapeutic contributions of immune mechanisms 
of action of trastuzumab.
To study  HER2/neu extracellular domain (ECD) circulating levels in the plasma of USPC patients 
over expressing HER2/neu before, during and after treatment to elucidate whether changes in 
HER2/neu ECD would predict response to trastuzumab.
To determine  whether CA-125 levels correlate with disease activity in persistent and/or recurrent 
disease.
14.5 Subjects  will be stratified by (a) Study Site and (b) Disease Stage (i.e. Stage III or Stage IV or 
Recurrent Disease).  Subjects  will be assigned at a 1:1 allocation ratio to Arm A 
(Carboplatin+Paclitaxel) or Arm B (Carboplatin+Paclitaxel plus Trastuzumab) by [CONTACT_17628].
14.6 Primary endpoint .  Progression-free survival (PFS), defined as the length of time from 
randomization to  disease recurrence, disease progression, or death for any reason.  Subjects who are

14.7 Statistical  analysis plan for primary endpoint.  Arm B (Carboplatin+Paclitaxel plus 
Trastuzumab) will  be compared to Arm A (Carboplatin+Paclitaxel) for an increase in PFS by [CONTACT_69173], conducted using a one-sided alpha=0.10.  A single interim analysis for futility 
will be conducted when the observed number of recurrence/progression/death events reaches 26 or 
>30% of the required total of 85.  
 14.[ADDRESS_75575] 90% power to detect a 43% decrease in hazard of a 
recurrence/progression/death event in Arm B compared to Arm A (hazard ratio = 0.57).  This 43% 
decrease in hazard is equivalent to an increase in median PFS from 6 months in the control arm to 
10.5 months in the trastuzumab arm.  For the sample-size calculation, we will assume a median PFS 
of 6 months in the control arm.  For the interim-analysis adjustment, we will use the Lan-DeMets 
(O’Brien-Fleming) spending function to allocate Type II error.
14.9 Study  design, sample size, and study duration.  The following study design meets the statistical 
power requirement:  
 A  total of 100 subjects will be accrued to the study, at a rate of five subjects 
per month for a total of 20 months.  
 The  interim analysis for futility will take place when 26 
recurrence/progression/death events have occurred.  If the log-rank z-score has a value 
more negative than –1.328 (equivalent to a 1-sided P value greater than 0.908, and to 
an apparent 69% increase in hazard for trastuzumab compared to control), then the 
result will be  taken as evidence of treatment futility, and the study will be terminated 
early, before reaching full accrual.  Based on an accrual rate of [ADDRESS_75576] to observe 26 events at 12.9 
months into the study, when cumulative accrual should be 65 subjects or fewer (<65% 
of 100).  
o This  early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_69120]=0.0030 of Type II error 
(inappropriately causing early termination) when the true trastuzumab effect is a 
43% decrease in hazard compared to control.
o The  interim-analysis trigger point of [ADDRESS_75577] sufficient time to review the results and make a 
decision before final accrual of 100 subjects is reached.      
 The  final analysis for efficacy will take place when 85 recurrence/
progression/death events have occurred.   Based on an accrual rate of [ADDRESS_75578] to observe 85 events 
at 33.6 months of study duration.

1 INTRODUCTION  
1.1 Background  
COVID -19 is a contagious respi[INVESTIGATOR_4375], caused by [CONTACT_206088][INVESTIGATOR_7531] 2 (SARS -CoV -2).  This communicable disease 
is easily transmitted through aerosolized droplets containing the infectio us virus.  Infections with 
SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_245758] ten days after the onset of symptoms.   
Influenza ( Flu) is a contagious respi[INVESTIGATOR_206064], 
throat, and lungs. This communicable disease is  also transmitted through droplets  containing the 
virus. Influenza (flu) can cause mild to severe illness, and at times can lead to death. There are 
two main types of influenza (flu) viruses: types A and B. The influenza A and B viruses that 
routinely spread in people (human influenza viruses) are responsible fo r seasonal flu epi[INVESTIGATOR_206065].  Individuals infected with Flu  are believed  to be the most contagious in the first three 
to four days after the  onset of symptoms, however , they may still spread the  virus and have no 
symptoms. Infants and individuals wit h weake ned immune systems who are infected with flu 
viruses may be contagious for longer than seven days.  
The r apid detection of infections and contacts and the implementation of infection control 
measures are critical for mitigation of th ese virus es. 
The MGC Health COVID -19 & Flu A+B Home Multi Test  is a lateral flow  
immunochromatographic antibody assay intended for the  simultaneous  qualitative detection and 
differentiation of the nucleocapsid antigen from SARS -CoV -2, influenza A and/or influenza B  
direct ly from anterior nasal swab specimens obtained  from individuals , who are suspected of 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_206066] (5) days of symptom onset .  This test is intended for non -
prescription home use with self -collected direct anterior nares swab samples from individuals 
ages 14 years and older or adult lay user  collected anterior nares swab samples  from individuals 
aged 2 to 13 years.  
1.2 Study Purpose  
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the usability of MGC Health COVID -19 & Flu A+B 
Home Multi T est in Home Use.  
1.[ADDRESS_245759] safety is in the collection of nasal 
specimens from the anterior nares using a nasal swab.  The risks of collecting a specimen using a

1.5.1  Intended Use  
The MGC Health COVID -19 & Flu A+B Home Multi Test  is a lateral flow 
immunochromatographic antibody assay intended for th e simultaneous qualitative detection and 
differentiation of the nucleocapsid antigen from SARS -CoV -2, influenza A and/or influenza B 
directly from anterior nasal swab specimens obtained from individuals, who are suspected of 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_206074] (5) days of symptom onset.  This test is intended  for non -
prescription home use with self -collected direct anterior nares swab samples from individuals 
ages 14 years and older or adult lay user collected anterior nares  swab samples from individuals 
aged 2 to 13 years . 
Results are for the simultaneous identification of SARS -CoV -2, influenza A, and influenza B. 
The MGC Health COVID -19 & Flu A+B Home Multi Test is not intended to detect influenza C 
antigens.  These viral an tigens are generally detectable in anterior nasal swab specimens during 
the acute phase of infection.  Positive results indicate the presence of viral antigens, but clinical 
correlation with patient history and other diagnostic information is necessary to determine 
infection status.  Positive results do not rule out bacterial infection or co -infection with other 
viruses.  The agent detected may not be the definite cause of disease.  Individuals who test 
positive with the MGC Health COVID -19 & Flu A+B Home M ulti Test  should self - isolate and 
seek follow -up care with their physician or healthcare provider as additional testing may be 
necessary.  
Negative SARS -CoV -2 results should be treated as presumptive and confirmed with a molecular 
assay, if necessary, for patient management.  Negative results do not rule out SARS -CoV -2 
infection and should not be used as the sole basis for treatment or patient management decisions, 
including infection control decisions.  Negative results should be considered in the context of an 
individual’s recent exposures, history, and the presence of clinical signs and symptoms 
consistent with COVID -19.  
Negative influenza A and B test results should be treated as presumptive.  It is recommended 
these results be confirmed by [CONTACT_206089] e or an FDA cleared influenza A and B molecular assay.  
Negative results do not preclude influenza virus infection and should not be used as the sole 
basis for treatment or other management decisions.  
Additional confirmatory testing with a molecular test f or positive results may also be necessary, 
if there is a low likelihood of COVID -[ADDRESS_245767] negative and continue to experience symptoms of fever, cough 
and/or shortness of breath may still have SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_245768] to relevant 
public health authorities in accordance with local, state, and fe deral requirements using

1.6 For Investigational Use Only  
The MGC Health COVID -19 & Flu A+B Home Multi Test is a lateral flow 
immunochromatographic antibody assay intended for the simultaneous qualitative detection and 
differentiation of the nucleocapsid antigen from SARS -CoV -2, influenza A and/or influenza B 
directly from anterior nasal swab specimens obta ined from individuals, who are suspected of 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_206067] (5) days of symptom onset.  This test is intended for non -
prescription home use with self -collected direct anterior nares swab samples from individuals 
ages [ADDRESS_245769] not been 
established.  The results obtained from this study will not be used for diagnostic  purposes or 
patient management.  
Results are intended for the simultaneous identification of SARS -CoV -2, influenza A, and /or 
influenza B, which  are generally detectable in nasal samples during the acute phase of infection.   
Positive results indicate the presence of viral antigens, but clinical correlation with patient 
history and other diagnostic information is necessary to determine infection status.  Positive 
results do not rule out bacterial infection or co -infection with  other viruses.  The agent detected 
may not be the definite cause of disease.  
1.7 Study Sites  
Study enrollment for this study will be conducted at one (1 ) testing site in the US.  The site will 
attempt to enroll a diverse demographic patient population with va rying educational 
backgrounds.

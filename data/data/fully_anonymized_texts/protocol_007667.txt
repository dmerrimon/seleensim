 9 1. BACKGROUND  
As descr
ibed in the Clinical Study Protocol ( CSP) (Section 1.3), the mechanism of action 
of pi[INVESTIGATOR_16320] (IPF) has not been established (Esbriet® 
EU SmPc and US label 2014), while nintedanib is thought to act by [CONTACT_16400] (Esbriet® US label 2014). Because multiple co-activated pathways are 
involved in the pathogenesis of IPF, experts have suggested that targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_16321] (Wuyts et al. 2014). Furthermore, experience in other 
pulmonary diseases (e.g., asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_16317] — F. Hoffmann-La [COMPANY_002] Ltd 18 / Protocol MA29895, 
Version 2 pulmonary hypertension) has demonstrated the value of moving from 
monotherapy to combination therapy.  
The positive benefit risk assessment of both drugs have been established in respective 
Phase II and Phase III programs which led to approval in the EU, the US, Japan and 
many other countries worldwide. Both drugs demonstrated that pulmonary function could 
be significantly improved in IPF patients, while the safety and tolerability profile was 
considered acceptable.  
Considering the overlap in the gastrointestinal (GI) and hepatic Adverse Events ( AEs) 
associated with these two drugs, it is worthwhile to characterize the safety and 
tolerability of nintedanib when added to pi[INVESTIGATOR_16322] a combination treatment using the 
doses recommended in the respective pi[INVESTIGATOR_16323].  
This prospective study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of 24 weeks of nintedanib 
combination treatment in patients with IPF who are on a stable dose of pi[INVESTIGATOR_16324]. The study is not designed to evaluate the efficacy of 
combination treatment, nor is it designed to assess the safety and tolerability of adding 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_16325]. 
 
2. STUDY DESIGN  
This i
s a multicenter, international, open-label, single-arm safety and tolerability study of 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_7735]/nintedanib combination treatment in patients with IPF who have been on a 
stable dose of pi[INVESTIGATOR_16326]. In this study, a stable 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_16327] 1602 –2403 mg/d (801 mg twice daily [BID] or three 
times daily [TID]). Up to approximately [ADDRESS_15584] 16 weeks 
and on a stable dose (1602 –2403 mg/d) for at least 28 days; also, the dose must be 
expected to remain within that range throughout the study. In addition, in the [ADDRESS_15585] experienced either a new o r

Statistical Analysis Plan MA29895, Version 1.0, final, 21 November 2016  
 11 2.2.5 Safety Outcome Measures  
The primar
y safety outcome measure is: 
 Proportion of patients who complete 24 weeks of combination treatment on 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_16332] a dose of 1602 –2403 mg/d and nintedanib at a dose of 200 –300 
mg/d. 
Secondary safety outcome measures are: 
 Proportion of patients who discontinue pi[INVESTIGATOR_7735], nintedanib, or both study 
treatments because of adverse events before the Week 24 visit, 
 Total number of patient days of combination treatment with pi[INVESTIGATOR_16332] a dose 
of 1602 –2403 mg/d and nintedanib at a dose of 200 –300 mg/d, 
 Total number of days from the initiation of combination treatment to 
discontinuation of pi[INVESTIGATOR_7735], nintedanib, or both study treatments, 
 Frequency and timing of Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events 
(SAEs). 
 
2.3 DETERMINATION OF SAMPLE SIZE 
A sample size of approximately 80 patients was selected based on the AE 
discontinuation rates after one year observed in the randomized Phase 3 pi[INVESTIGATOR_16333] 2 and 3 nintedanib studies (pi[INVESTIGATOR_7735] 14.6% AE 
discontinuation [Esbriet® US label 2014]; nintedanib 21% AE discontinuation [Ofev® US 
label 2014]). Given that for pi[INVESTIGATOR_16334] 24 weeks was 6%-
8% in studies PI[INVESTIGATOR_16335]-004 and PI[INVESTIGATOR_16335]-006 it is a reasonable assumption that the nintedanib 
discontinuation rate was around 10%-11%. As in this study of combination treatment, it 
is possible that the addition of nintedanib to ongoing pi[INVESTIGATOR_16336], given the overlap 
in the GI and hepatic effects of pi[INVESTIGATOR_16317].  
Assuming 85% of the patients complete 24 weeks of combination treatment, a sample 
size of 80 patients would be expected to yield an actual completion rate of 77.2% - 
92.8% using a 95% confidence interval (CI).  Table 1 shows the 95% CIs associated with 
projected completion rates of 75%, 80%, 85%, 90% or 95%, assuming an 80-patient 
sample size.

 13 3.3 DATA MONITORING 
An independent Data Monitoring Committee (iDMC) will review safety data and advise 
on study conduct at least three times during the study. For details on timing of the safety 
reviews please see Table 2 above. Efficacy data will only be provided if requested by [CONTACT_16402]. For details please see Section  4.10.  
 
4. STATISTICAL METHODS  
This is
 a safety and tolerability study, not designed to assess efficacy, comprising only 
one treatment group. There are no formal statistical hypothesis tests to be performed, 
and there will be no adjustments for multiplicity of endpoints or within-subgroups 
comparisons . Efficacy analyses will be limited to descriptive statistics.  
Categorical data will be summarized using frequencies and percentages (including a 
category for missing, if appropriate).  
Continuous endpoints will be summarized using descriptive statistics (mean, standard 
deviation, minimum, 25th and 75th quartiles, median, and maximum).  
Where data will be presented over time, e.g. Baseline, Week 12, Week 24, and early 
discontinuation visit, an end of treatment visit (EOT) will be added. This will include 
Week 24 data for patients who completed 24 weeks of combination treatment and data 
from the early discontinuation visit for patients who prematurely discontinued from 
combination treatment. 
Other analysis methods will be specified below, where applicable. All data recorded in 
the electronic Case Report Form (eCRF), as well as derived data that will be used in 
analyses, will be listed.  
Analyses will be presented for the total population, together with geographic region, i.e.  
US and non-US patients. Results for US and n on-US will be presented as additional 
columns or additional blocks within the outputs of the total population. 
Percentages will be based on the total population or on the number of patients in the 
respective geographic region, if not otherwise specified. 
4.1 ANALYSIS POPULATIONS 
Only one analysis population, the Safety Population, has been defined as per CSP . No 
further analysis populations will be assessed.

Analyses will be descriptive. No confirmatory analyses are defined and no comparative 
statistics will be generated.  
The main and final time point for safety assessments is at the final analysis. However, 
decisions at the different stages of this study (such as during iDMCs) may require 
deeper  insight into safety data. Therefore, a selection or all of the specified safety 
evaluations of this section will be conducted at each analysis time point.

 22 Patients’ safety will be assessed further through analyses of treatment exposure , 
laboratory tests, vital signs, and ECGs. 
4.7.1 Treatment Completion/Early Discontinuation  
A summary of t
he number and proportion of patients who complete 24 weeks of 
combination treatment (with 95% CI) will be presented. A patient is considered to have 
completed 24 weeks of combination treatment, if the eCRF question “Did the subject 
complete the treatment?” is ticked “Yes” (eCRF form “Study Drug Completion /Early 
Discontinuation”). It is expected that these patients have completed the Week 24 visit 
within expected time window (see Section 4.9) , but patients performing the Week 24 visit 
outside of these windows will also be considered for this analysis. 
The number and proportion of patients who complete 24 weeks of combination treatment 
(with 95% confidence interval ( CI)) on pi[INVESTIGATOR_16332] a dose of 1602-2403 mg/d and 
nintedanib at a dose of 200-300 mg/d will be presented. Average daily dose information 
as defined in Section 4.7.2 will be used to assess whether a patient completed 24 weeks 
on target dose. 
The number and percentage of patients who discontinued combination treatment 
because of an adverse event (with 95% CI) will also be presented. This summary 
comprises patients who have reported “Adverse Event” as main reason for treatment 
discontinuation. 
The duration of combination treatment (weeks) and duration of participation in the study 
(weeks) (incl. follow-up) will be summarized descriptively. Duration of combination 
treatment will be defined as the time from combination treatment start date (see Section 
4.2.2)  to the date subject completed or early discontinued from combination treatment 
period as per eCRF (Study Drug Completion/Early discontinuation form). Duration of 
participation in the study will be defined as the time from date of Screening to date of 
Follow-up visit.  
Kaplan-Meier (KM) plots for time to treatment discontinuation will be provided, based on 
the date subject completed or early discontinued from combination treatment period, as 
per eCRF (see Section  4.2.5) . Separate lines by [CONTACT_16407] (i.e. pi[INVESTIGATOR_7735], nintedanib, both or ‘not applicable’ ) 
will be added to this presentation. The date of last administration of the respective study 
drug as per the eCRF drug logs will be used for these presentations. 
Details on treatment and study discontinuations will be listed. 
Logistic regression analysis will be used to assess the influence of baseline covariates 
on the discontinuation rate in an exploratory manner. The following parameters will be 
used to explain early treatment discontinuation:

 Sex (female = 0, male = 1), 
 FVC % predicted at baseline, 
 DLco % predicted at baseline. 
 Region (US vs non- US) 
Further parameters will be analyzed on an exploratory basis.  
The regression coefficients for each covariate, together with the standard error and p-
value will be presented. Further, odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals will also be 
given. In addition, a model including all covariates will be investigated in order to assess 
the consistency of the results. 
4.7.2 Exposure of Study Medication  
Summari
es of dosing, treatment duration, dose interruptions or reductions will be 
provided for each treatment separately, as well as for combination treatment, if 
applicable. 
The overall treatment duration  (weeks), including and excluding dose interruptions , will 
be summarized descriptively. Also the days with dose interruptions will be given in this 
presentation .  
The overall treatment duration including  dose interruptions will be defined as follows: 
 Overall duration of combination treatment including dose interruptions = 
(Maximum date of last dose of pi[INVESTIGATOR_16344] – date of 
initiation of combination treatment) + 1. 
The date of first administration of nintedanib or pi[INVESTIGATOR_16345] 
(Day 1) will be considered as initiation date of combination treatment (see Section 4.2.1) .  
 Overall treatment duration of pi[INVESTIGATOR_7735]/nintedanib including dose interruptions 
= (Date of last dose of treatment received – date of initiation of combination 
treatment) + 1. 
The overall treatment duration excluding  dose interruptions will be derived from the 
treatment administration panels, considering only days on treatment . When calculating 
duration of combination treatment, only days where both, pi[INVESTIGATOR_16317], 
were interrupted will be excluded. 
Dose interruptions will be calculated by [CONTACT_16408] (pi[INVESTIGATOR_16346]) was interrupted. Combination treatment will only be considered to be 
interrupted if both, pi[INVESTIGATOR_16317], were interrupted.

Statistical Analysis Plan MA29895, Version 1.0, final, 21 November 2016  
 24 The total number of patient days on treatment, including and excluding dose 
interruptions, and the total number of patient days with dose interruptions, will be 
presented. 
The total dose  (mg), the last dose administered  (mg/d) and the average daily dose 
for each of the study treatments will be presented descriptively. The average daily dose 
will be calculated by [CONTACT_16409], divided by [CONTACT_16410], as defined above. 
Further, frequencies for categories of average daily doses (e.g. <1602, 1602 – 
2403, >2403 mg/d for pi[INVESTIGATOR_7735], and <200, 200 – 300, >300 for nintedanib, as well as 
combinations of both) will be presented. 
Dose modifications  will be investigated for any modification, as well as for dose 
reductions and drug interruptions separately. Numbers and proportions of patients with 
at least one dose modification, dose reduction or drug interruption will be presented for 
each treatment separately. Numbers and proportions of patients with 1, 2, 3 or more 
dose modifications, dose reductions or drug interruptions will be given. 
Numbers of dose modifications, reductions or interruptions will be presented together 
with numbers and frequencies of reasons for dose modification, reduction or interruption. 
Dose modifications, defined as dose reductions or drug interruptions will be derived from 
the drug log information on dose strength and number of capsules taken.  
4.7.3 Adverse Events  
Verbatim
 descriptions of adverse events ( AEs) will be mapped to a preferred term (PT) 
and system organ class (SOC) using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Agencies 
(MedDRA® ). MedDRA version 19.0 or higher and related SMQ lists (see below) will be 
used for coding. 
AEs will be graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE), Version 4.03. For AEs of varying severity, the 
most severe grade as documented on the eCRF will be used in the summaries. 
According to the protocol, after informed consent has been obtained but prior to initiation 
of combination treatment on Day 1, only SAEs caused by a protocol-mandated 
intervention should be reported. 
After initiation of combination treatment at o r after the ‘Baseline (Day 1)’ visit , all adverse 
events will be reported until [ADDRESS_15599] dose of study drug.  After this period, 
the Investigator should report any SAEs that are believed to be related to prior study 
drug treatment.

 28 4.7.6 Laboratory Data  
All l
aboratory parameters will be assessed by a central laboratory, with the exception of 
the results of urine pregnancy tests, which will be determined locally and will be 
recorded in the eCRF. 
All parameters will be graded according to NCI CTCAE (CTEP 2010), version 4.03, if 
applicable. Laboratory parameters that cannot be graded according to NCI CTCAE 
version 4.[ADDRESS_15604] to normal range (low, normal, high). 
The following laboratory parameters will be collected: 
 Hematology: complete blood count with platelet count and automated differential, 
i.e. hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelet count, red blood cell count, RBC morphology, 
white blood cell count, absolute differential count (neutrophils, bands, eosinophils, 
lymphocytes, monocytes, basophils), 
MCH, MCHC, MCV, 
 Serum chemistry:  albumin, alkaline phosphatase, ALT, AST, direct bilirubin* , 
total bilirubin, calcium, cholesterol, creatine kinase, creatinine, triglycerides, 
gamma-glutamyl transferase, glucose, lactic dehydrogenase*, magnesium, 
phosphorus*, potassium, sodium, urea nitrogen, serum uric acid*, and amylase, 
C-reactive protein (N HS)- PS* (CRP), Creatinine clearance rate*, calculated 
using the Cockcroft-Gault formula 
 Serum pregnancy test*, 
 Urine dipstick for pregnancy testing*(local). 
* = for these parameters no grading as per NCI CTCAE, version 4.03 is possible. 
Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) was planned to be collected according to the initial version of 
the Clinical Study Protocol (CSP), but was removed in Amendment 3 of the CSP as not 
specifically relevant for this patient population. HbA1c values are continuously reported 
by [CONTACT_2237], but will not be presented in any summary presentations. 
HbA1c values will only be listed. 
Clinical laboratory values will be presented separately for CTCAE-gradable and non-
CTCAE gradable parameters by [CONTACT_16416] (hematology, serum chemistry).  
Serum or urine pregnancy data will only be listed.  
For laboratory analyses, visits will be assigned to visit windows as described in Section 
4.9. This will also be valid for possible unscheduled visits. In case that multiple evaluable 
assessments occur within the same visit, the most extreme value will be used for 
analyses.

 29 The following summaries will be prepared: 
For each laboratory parameter, descriptive statistics of laboratory values at each 
scheduled visit (derived as described above), and absolute changes from baseline to 
post-baseline will be presented.  
Shift tables presenting changes from baseline to worst CTCAE grade, in the indicated 
direction, will be provided for CTCAE-gradable parameters. These changes will also be 
expressed as shifts of [ADDRESS_15605] to normal range category (low, normal, high). 
For CTCAE-gradable parameters, numbers and percentages of patients with laboratory 
values of Grade 3 and 4 will presented over time. Further, the total number of visits with 
Grade 3/4 elevations, as well as the number and percentages of patients with Grade 3/4 
elevations for each parameter will be provided. 
Liver abnormalities (total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, ALAT (SGPT), ASAT (SGOT)) 
of Grade [ADDRESS_15606]-baseline visit. The body mass index (BMI) will only be 
calculated for the BMI at baseline and presented with the demographic data.

presented. 
4.7.9 Previous and Concomitant Medication  
Previ
ous and concomitant medications are non-study medications. Different from the 
description in the Clinical Study Protocol, which describes that the non-study 
medications will be coded using the World Health Organization (WHO) Drug Dictionary , 
the previous and concomitant medication will be coded using the Genentech (GNE) drug 
dictionary. This is a proprietary [COMPANY_002] Dictionary which is used to code concomitant 
medications in the Trial Management System (TMS ) coding tool. The Standardized 
Medication Name (CMDECOD), which is the medication generic or combination generic 
as defined by [CONTACT_16417] (proprietary Genentech/[COMPANY_002] dictionary), and the 
Medication Class (CMCLAS), which is the primary medication class as defined by [CONTACT_16418], will be used for the analyses. 
Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_16350]: 
 Previous: If the medication end date is prior to start of combination treatment, 
 Concomitant: If medication is taken anytime between the start of combination 
treatment (Day 1) and [ADDRESS_15609]-treatment. This medication will be identified by a flag in the data 
listing. 
4.8 MISSING DATA 
In general, missing data will not be imputed. Exceptions will be made for the data related 
to adverse events and concomitant medications as described below. 
For adverse events, missing start or end dates will only be imputed for determination of 
whether the adverse event is considered to be treatment-emergent or not by [CONTACT_16419]: 
Incomplete or missing onset dates will be imputed to the earliest date possible (using 
any reliable portions of the onset date that are available and the eCFR flag on 
whether the event/medication occurred prior to study drug administration) following 
the first dose of combination treatment. Note that the onset day is considered 
unreliable if the month or year portions of the date are missing, and the onset month 
is considered unreliable if the year portion of the date is missing. If, given the

STUDY DESIGN  
DESCRIPTIO
N OF THE STUDY 
This is a multicenter, international, open-label, single-arm safety and tolerability study of 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_7735]/nintedan b combination treatment in patients with IPF who have been on a stable 
dose of pi[INVESTIGATOR_16326]. In this study, a stable pi[INVESTIGATOR_16354] 1602 –2403 mg/d (801 mg twice daily [BID] or three times daily [TID]). Up to 
approximately [ADDRESS_15615] 16 weeks and on a 
stable dose (1602 –2403 mg/d) for at least 28 days; also, the dose must be expected to remain 
within that range throughout the study. In addition, in the [ADDRESS_15616] experienced either a new or ongoing moderate or severe adverse reaction 
considered by [CONTACT_16420][INVESTIGATOR_7735], or an interruption of pi[INVESTIGATOR_16355] > 7 days for any reason. 
After providing informed consent and discussing the risks and benefits of the study with the 
Investigator, patients will be required to.taper and/or discontinue all prohibited medications 
(Section 4.4.2) at least 28 days before the start of Screening; this is the Washout Period. Patients 
will be instructed to continue their commercial pi[INVESTIGATOR_16356]. If a 
proh bited medication must be tapered, tapering must start early enough that the patient has 
discontinued the medication 28 days before the start of Screening. After completing Washout, 
patients will enter Screening, which lasts up to 21 days; during Screening, patients will be 
evaluated for eligibility based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Patients not taking a

pi[INVESTIGATOR_16358].  
During Screening, patients on a stable dose of pi[INVESTIGATOR_16359] 
(Study Day 1) as soon eligibility has been confirmed.  At this visit, they will have nintedanib added 
to the ongoing pi[INVESTIGATOR_16347].  Nintedanib dosing will start at 100 mg once daily (QD) and 
be titrated to 150 mg BID over 15 days, as tolerated, according to the schedule provided in 
protocol Error! Reference source not found. .  
The Sponsor will supply pi[INVESTIGATOR_16360]; nintedanib will be 
supplied in 100 mg and 150 mg capsules to facilitate temporary dose reduction if required for the 
management of AEs.  
Combination treatment will continue through Week 24, with monitoring by [CONTACT_16421]. Blood samples will be obtained from all patients for analysis of clinical 
laboratory values. 
Patients will be encouraged to remain on stable doses of pi[INVESTIGATOR_7735] (1602 –2403 mg/d) and 
nintedanib (200 –300 mg/d) throughout the combination-treatment period, unless dosing is 
modified to manage an AE.  Patients will return to the clinic for a final Follow-up Visit 28– 35 days 
after the completion of combination treatment.  
If one or both study treatments are prematurely discontinued or interrupted for  
≥ 28 consecutive days, nintedanib treatment will end as will the patient’s participation in the study; 
whether commercial pi[INVESTIGATOR_16361]. The patient will then ret urn to the clinic as soon as possible (≤ 7 days after the 
decision to discontinue nintedan b) for an Early Discontinuation Visit. 
In addition, 28 –[ADDRESS_15618] that provides important information relevant to 
study participation. 
On completion of study participation, patients may be prescr bed appropriate IPF treatment at 
the discretion of the treating physician. 
An independent Data Monitoring Committee (iDMC) will review safety data and advise on study 
conduct at least three times during the study: when the first approximately [ADDRESS_15619] 
completed 8 weeks of combination treatment or permanently discontinued study treatments, 
when approximately 50% of the total patient group has completed 12 weeks of combination 
treatment or permanently discontinued study treatments and when approximately 75% of the total 
patient group has completed 24 weeks of combination treatment or permanently discontinued 
study treatments. Additional ad hoc meetings or data reviews can be requested at any time by [CONTACT_16422], if warranted.

Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). Laboratory abnormalities will be graded using the Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE). Prior and concomitant medications will be 
coded using the World Health Organization (WHO) Drug Dictionary. 
Because this is a safety and tolerability study that is not designed to assess efficacy, no formal 
statistical hypotheses for efficacy will be assessed. The efficacy analyses will be limited to 
descriptive statistics.  
Data summaries will be provided for baseline characteristics; patient disposition; extent of 
exposure; the number and proportion of patients who complete 24 weeks on pi[INVESTIGATOR_16332] a 
dose of 1602 –2403 mg/d and nintedanib at a dose of 200 –300 mg/d (with 95% confidence 
interval [ CI]); the numbers and proportions of patients with a dose reduction or a dose interruption; 
the number and proportion of patients who discontinued combination treatment because of a AE 
(with 95% CI); the total number of days on combination treatment at an pi[INVESTIGATOR_16372] 1602 –

 41 ECG data will be summarized, presenting the numbers and proportions of patients with a 
maximum QTcF interval < 500 ms, 500 –550 ms, and > 550 ms; with a maximum change from the 
baseline QTcF interval of ≤ 30  ms, 31 –60 ms, and > 60 ms; and with ECG changes considered 
by [CONTACT_16426].  
DETERMINATION OF SAMPLE SIZE 
A sample size of approximately 80 patients was selected based on the AE discontinuation rates 
after one year observed in the randomized Phase 3 pi[INVESTIGATOR_16373] 2 and 3 nintedanib studies (pi[INVESTIGATOR_7735] 14.6%, nintedanib 21%; per the 2014 US labels). 
Given that for pi[INVESTIGATOR_16334] 24 weeks was 6%-8% in studies PI[INVESTIGATOR_16335]-004 
and PI[INVESTIGATOR_16335]-006 it is a reasonable assumption that the nintedanib discontinuation rate was around 
10% - 11%. As in this study of combination treatment, it is possible that the addition of nintedanib 
to ongoing pi[INVESTIGATOR_16374], given the overlap in the GI and hepatic effects of the two medications.  
Assuming 85% of the patients complete 24 weeks of combination treatment, a sample size of 80 
patients would be expected to yield an actual completion rate of 77.2% to 92.8% using a 95% CI

 11 1. BACKGROUND  
As descr
ibed in the Clinical Study Protocol ( CSP) (Section 1.3), the mechanism of action 
of pi[INVESTIGATOR_16320] (IPF) has not been established (Esbriet® 
EU SmPc and US label 2014), while nintedanib is thought to act by [CONTACT_16400] (Esbriet® US label 2014). Because multiple co-activated pathways are 
involved in the pathogenesis of IPF, experts have suggested that targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_16321] (Wuyts et al. 2014). Furthermore, experience in other 
pulmonary diseases (e.g., asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_16317] — F. Hoffmann-La [COMPANY_002] Ltd 18 / Protocol MA29895, 
Version 2 pulmonary hypertension) has demonstrated the value of moving from 
monotherapy to combination therapy.  
The positive benefit risk assessment of both drugs have been established in respective 
Phase II and Phase III programs which led to approval in the EU, the US, Japan and 
many other countries worldwide. Both drugs demonstrated that pulmonary function could 
be significantly improved in IPF patients, while the safety and tolerability profile was 
considered acceptable.  
Considering the overlap in the gastrointestinal (GI) and hepatic Adverse Events ( AEs) 
associated with these two drugs, it is worthwhile to characterize the safety and 
tolerability of nintedanib when added to pi[INVESTIGATOR_16322] a combination treatment using the 
doses recommended in the respective pi[INVESTIGATOR_16323].  
This prospective study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of 24 weeks of nintedanib 
combination treatment in patients with IPF who are on a stable dose of pi[INVESTIGATOR_16324]. The study is not designed to evaluate the efficacy of 
combination treatment, nor is it designed to assess the safety and tolerability of adding 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_16325]. 
 
2. STUDY DESIGN  
This i
s a multicenter, international, open-label, single-arm safety and tolerability study of 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_7735]/nintedanib combination treatment in patients with IPF who have been on a 
stable dose of pi[INVESTIGATOR_16326]. In this study, a stable 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_16327] 1602 –2403 mg/d (801 mg twice daily [BID] or three 
times daily [TID]). Up to approximately [ADDRESS_15642] 16 weeks 
and on a stable dose (1602 –2403 mg/d) for at least 28 days; also, the dose must be 
expected to remain within that range throughout the study. In addition, in the [ADDRESS_15643] experienced either a new or

2.1 PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS 
The Protocol Synopsis is in Appendix 1.   For additional details, see the Schedule of 
Assessments in  Appendix 2.  For additional details, please see the Protocol Amendment 
Version 3, 21 June 2016 (and its Appendices). 
2.2 OUTCOME MEASURES 
The primary objective for this study is to investigate the safety and tolerability of adding 
nintedanib to treatment with pi[INVESTIGATOR_16330]. Consequently, the primary 
objectives of this study focus on safety and tolerability and not efficacy.

Statistical Analysis Plan MA29895, Version 2.0, final, 17 May 2017  
 13 2.2.5 Safety Outcome Measures  
The primar
y safety outcome measure is: 
 Proportion of patients who complete 24 weeks of combination treatment on 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_16332] a dose of 1602 –2403 mg/d and nintedanib at a dose of 200 –300 
mg/d. 
Secondary safety outcome measures are: 
 Proportion of patients who discontinue pi[INVESTIGATOR_7735], nintedanib, or both study 
treatments because of adverse events before the Week 24 visit, 
 Total number of patient days of combination treatment with pi[INVESTIGATOR_16332] a dose 
of 1602 –2403 mg/d and nintedanib at a dose of 200 –300 mg/d, 
 Total number of days from the initiation of combination treatment to 
discontinuation of pi[INVESTIGATOR_7735], nintedanib, or both study treatments, 
 Frequency and timing of Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events 
(SAEs). 
 
2.3 DETERMINATION OF SAMPLE SIZE 
A sample size of approximately 80 patients was selected based on the AE 
discontinuation rates after one year observed in the randomized Phase 3 pi[INVESTIGATOR_16333] 2 and 3 nintedanib studies (pi[INVESTIGATOR_7735] 14.6% AE 
discontinuation [Esbriet® US label 2014]; nintedanib 21% AE discontinuation [Ofev® US 
label 2014]). Given that for pi[INVESTIGATOR_16334] 24 weeks was 6%-
8% in studies PI[INVESTIGATOR_16335]- 004 and PI[INVESTIGATOR_16335]-006 it is a reasonable assumption that the nintedanib 
discontinuation rate was around 10%-11%. As in this study of combination treatment, it 
is possible that the addition of nintedanib to ongoing pi[INVESTIGATOR_16336], given the overlap 
in the GI and hepatic effects of pi[INVESTIGATOR_16317].  
Assuming 85% of the patients complete 24 weeks of combination treatment, a sample 
size of 80 patients would be expected to yield an actual completion rate of 77.2% - 
92.8% using a 95% confidence interval (CI).  Table 1 shows the 95% CIs associated with 
projected completion rates of 75%, 80%, 85%, 90% or 95%, assuming an 80-patient 
sample size.

4. STATISTICAL METHODS  
This is
 a safety and tolerability study, not designed to assess efficacy, comprising only 
one treatment group. There are no formal statistical hypothesis tests to be performed, 
and there will be no adjustments for multiplicity of endpoints or within-subgroups 
comparisons . Efficacy analyses will be limited to descriptive statistics.  
Categorical data will be summarized using frequencies and percentages (including a 
category for missing, if appropriate).  
Continuous endpoints will be summarized using descriptive statistics (mean, standard 
deviation, minimum, 25th and 75th quartiles, median, and maximum).  
Where data will be presented over time, e.g. Baseline, Week 12, Week 24, and early 
discontinuation visit, an end of treatment visit (EOT) will be added. This will include 
Week 24 data for patients who completed 24 weeks of combination treatment and data 
from the early discontinuation visit for patients who prematurely discontinued from 
combination treatment. 
Other analysis methods will be specified below, where applicable. All data recorded in 
the electronic Case Report Form (eCRF), as well as derived data that will be used in 
analyses, will be listed.  
Analyses will be presented for the total population, together with geographic region, i.e.  
US and non-US patients. Results for US and non- US will be presented as additional 
columns or additional blocks within the outputs of the total population. 
Percentages will be based on the total population or on the number of patients in the 
respective geographic region, if not otherwise specified. 
4.1 ANALYSIS POPULATIONS

4.2 TRIAL PERIODS, OBSERVATION AND ANALYSIS TIMES 
In case that durations are to be calculated (e.g. treatment duration), these will be derived 
based on days and converted to months and years if needed, using 30.4375 and 365.25, 
respectively, as denominator if not otherwise specified.  
4.2.1 Study Days  
Study
 day is defined as the number of days since combination treatment start date, and 
is calculated as: 
 For assessments on or after the day of start of combination treatment: 
Study day = Assessment date – Date of start of combination treatment + 1. 
 For assessments before the day of start of combination treatment: 
Study day = Assessment date – Date of start of combination treatment 
The day of the first dose of combination treatment is defined as Day 1.

Analyses will be descriptive. No confirmatory analyses are defined and no comparative 
statistics will be generated.  
Patients’ safety will be assessed further through analyses of treatment exposure , 
laboratory tests, vital signs, and ECGs. 
4.7.1 Treatment Completion/Early Discontinuation  
A summary of t
he number and proportion of patients who complete 24 weeks of 
combination treatment (with 95% CI) will be presented. A patient is considered to have 
completed 24 weeks of combination treatment, if the eCRF question “Did the subject 
complete the treatment?” is ticked “Yes” (eCRF form “Study Drug Completion/Early 
Discontinuation”). It is expected that thes e patients have completed the Week 24 visit 
within expected time window (see Section 4.9) . 
The number and proportion of patients who complete 24 weeks of combination treatment 
(with 95% confidence interval ( CI)) on pi[INVESTIGATOR_16332] a dose of 1602-2403 mg/d and 
nintedanib at a dose of 200-300 mg/d will be presented. Average daily dose information 
as defined in Section 4.7.2 will be used to assess whether a patient completed 24 weeks 
on target dose. 
The number and percentage of patients who discontinued combination treatment 
because of an adverse event (with 95% CI) will also be presented. This summary 
comprises patients who have reported “Adverse Event” as the main reason for treatment 
discontinuation. 
The duration of combination treatment will be summarized descriptively. Duration of 
combination tr
eatment will be defined as the time (days) from combination treatment 
start date (see Section 4.2.2)  to the date subject completed or early discontinued from 
combination treatment period as per eCRF (Study Drug Completion/Early 
discontinuation form).  
Kaplan-Meier (KM) plots for time to treatment discontinuation will be provided, based on 
the date subject completed or early discontinued from combination treatment period, as 
per eCRF (see Section  4.2.5) .  
Details on treatment and study discontinuations will be listed.

 25 Logistic regression analysis will be used to assess the influence of baseline covariates 
on the discontinuation rate in an exploratory manner. The following parameters will be 
used to explain early treatment discontinuation: 
 Age (years) at baseline,  
 Sex (female = 0, male = 1), 
 FVC % predicted at baseline, 
 DLco % predicted at baseline. 
 Region (US vs non- US) 
Further parameters will be analyzed on an exploratory basis.  
The regression coefficients for each covariate, together with the standard error and p-
value will be presented. Further, odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals will also be 
given. In addition, a model including all covariates will be investigated in order to assess 
the consistency of the results. 
4.7.2 Exposure of Study Medication  
Summari
es of dosing, treatment duration, dose interruptions or reductions will be 
provided for each treatment separately, as well as for combination treatment, if 
applicable.  
Generally, treatments administered from combination treatment start date up to the ‘Date 
subject completed or early discontinued from combination treatment period’ as per eCRF 
‘Study drug completion/Early Discontinuation’ will be considered for exposure analyses.   
All drug records before or after these dates reported in the drug-log will be disregarded . 
The below definitions are to be interpreted within this time window. 
The overall treatment duration  (weeks), including and excluding dose interruptions , will 
be summarized descriptively. Also the days with dose interruptions will be given in this 
presentation .  
The overall treatment duration including  dose interruptions will be defined as follows: 
 Overall duration of combination treatment including dose interruptions = [(Date of 
discontinuation/completion of combination treatment – date of initiation of 
combination treatment) + 1]/7. 
The date of first administration of nintedanib and pi[INVESTIGATOR_16393] (see Section  4.2.1) .  
 Overall treatment duration of pi[INVESTIGATOR_16394] = [(Date of last non-zero dose of treatment received until

 26 discontinuation/completion of combination treatment – date of initiation of 
combination treatment) + 1]/7. 
The overall treatment duration excluding  dose interruptions will be derived from the 
treatment administration panels, considering only days on treatment . When calculating 
duration of combination treatment, only days where both, pi[INVESTIGATOR_16317], 
were interrupted will be excluded. 
Dose interruptions will be calculated by [CONTACT_16408] (pi[INVESTIGATOR_16346]) was interrupted. Combination treatment will only be considered to be 
interrupted if both, pi[INVESTIGATOR_16317], were interrupted. 
The total number of patient days on treatment, including and excluding dose 
interruptions, and the total number of patient days with dose interruptions, will be 
presented. 
The total dose  (mg), the last dose administered  (mg/d) and the average daily dose 
for each of the study treatments will be presented descriptively. The average daily dose 
will be calculated by [CONTACT_16434], divided by [CONTACT_16435], as defined above. Further, frequencies for categories of average 
daily doses (e.g. <1602, 1602 – 2403, >2403 mg/d for pi[INVESTIGATOR_7735], and <200, 200 – 
300, >300 for nintedanib, as well as combinations of both) will be presented. 
Dose modifications and dose  interruptions  will be analyzed for any dose modification 
or dose interruption, as well as for dose modifications and drug interruptions separately. 
Numbers and proportions of patients with at least one dose modification or dose 
interruption will be presented for each treatment separately. Numbers and proportions of 
patients with 1, 2, 3 or more dose modifications or drug interruptions will be given. 
Numbers and frequencies of reasons for dose modification or dose interruption will be 
presented. 
Analyses will be based on the information on dose modifications or dose interruptions as 
provided by [CONTACT_16436]/completion of combination treatment.

 27 4.7.3 Adverse Events  
Verbatim
 descriptions of adverse events ( AEs) will be mapped to a preferred term (PT) 
and system organ class (SOC) using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Agencies 
(MedDRA® ). MedDRA version 19.0 or higher and related SMQ lists (see below) will be 
used for coding. 
AEs will be graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE), Version 4.03. For AEs of varying severity, the 
most severe grade as documented on the eCRF will be used in the summaries. 
According to the protocol, after informed consent has been obtained but prior to initiation 
of combination treatment on Day 1, only SAEs caused by a protocol-mandated 
intervention should be reported. 
After initiation of combination treatment at or after the Baseline visit, all adverse events 
will be reported until [ADDRESS_15658] dose of study drug.  After this period, the 
Investigator should report any SAEs that are believed to be related to prior study drug 
treatment. 
An AE that started or worsened on the day of initiation of combination treatment through 
28 days after the ‘date a subject completed or early discontinued from combination 
treatment period’ as per eCRF ‘Study drug completion/Early Discontinuation’  will be 
considered treatment emergent. 
The analysis of AEs will focus on treatment-emergent AEs (TEAE), but a ll AEs will be 
listed. For AEs that might occur after initiation of investigational pi[INVESTIGATOR_16395] 28 days after the end of combination treatment a 
separate listing will be provided. 
Classifications of seriousness, severity and causality are described in the protocol 
sections 5.2 and 5.3. 
An overview of patient safety profile will present the number and proportion of patients 
experiencing  
  all and related treatment-emergent adverse events ( TEAE),  
 all and related serious treatment-emergent adverse events (serious TE AE),

be considered as to be ‘LOW ’ for presentation in shift tables, if the value (e.g. ‘2’)  equals 
the lower limit of normal. The value as such (e.g. ‘2’ ) will be used for descriptive statistics. 
The following laboratory parameters will be collected: 
 Hematology: complete blood count with platelet count and automated differential, 
i.e. hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelet count, red blood cell count, RBC morphology, 
white blood cell count, absolute differential count (neutrophils, bands, eosinophils, 
lymphocytes, monocytes, basophils), 
MCH, MCHC, MCV, 
 Serum chemistry:  albumin, alkaline phosphatase, ALT, AST, direct bilirubin* , 
total bilirubin, calcium, cholesterol, creatine kinase, creatinine*, triglycerides, 
gamma-glutamyl transferase, glucose, lactic dehydrogenase*, magnesium, 
phosphorus*, potassium, sodium, urea nitrogen, serum uric acid*, and amylase, 
C-reactive protein (N HS)- PS* (CRP), Creatinine clearance rate*, calculated 
using the Cockcroft-Gault formula 
 Serum pregnancy test*, 
 Urine dipstick for pregnancy testing*(local). 
* = for these parameters no grading as per NCI CTCAE, version 4.03 is applicable. 
Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) was planned to be collected according to the initial version of 
the Clinical Study Protocol (CSP), but was removed in Amendment 3 of the CSP as not 
specifically relevant for this patient population. HbA1c values are continuously reported 
by [CONTACT_2237], but will not be presented in any summary presentations. 
HbA1c values will only be listed.

Previous 
and concomitant medications are non-study medications. Different from the 
description in the Clinical Study Protocol, which describes that the non-study 
medications will be coded using the World Health Organization (WHO) Drug Dictionary , 
the previous and concomitant medication will be coded using the Genentech (GNE) drug 
dictionary. This is a proprietary [COMPANY_002] Dictionary which is used to code concomitant 
medications in the Trial Management System (TMS ) coding tool. The Standardized 
Medication Name (CMDECOD), which is the medication generic or combination generic 
as defined by [CONTACT_16417] (proprietary Genentech/[COMPANY_002] dictionary), and the 
Medication Class (CMCLAS), which is the primary medication class as defined by [CONTACT_16438], will be used for the analyses.

listing. 
4.8 MISSING DATA 
In general, missing data will not be imputed. Exceptions will be made for the data related 
to adverse events and concomitant medications as described below. 
For adverse events, missing start or end dates will only be imputed for determination of 
whether the adverse event is considered to be treatment-emergent or not by [CONTACT_16419]: 
Incomplete or missing onset dates will be imputed to the earliest date possible (using 
any reliable portions of the onset date that are available and the eCFR flag on 
whether the event/medication occurred prior to study drug administration) following 
the first dose of combination treatment. Note that the onset day is considered 
unreliable if the month or year portions of the date are missing, and the onset month 
is considered unreliable if the year portion of the date is missing. If, given the 
completed portions of the adverse event onset date and the known first combination 
treatment start date, the event could not have started after the first dose of 
combination treatment, then the adverse event will be considered non-treatment-
emergent and the onset date will be left as an incomplete date. 
If the stop date is completely missing, then the event will be assumed to be ongoing and 
a stop date will not be imputed.  
For imputation and handling of missing intensity or relationship to study medication, 
please see Section  4.7.3.  
All other missing or incomplete adverse event data will be left as missing. 
For concomitant medications, missing start or end dates will only be imputed for 
determination of whether the concomitant medication is considered to be prior, on-
treatment, post-treatment. The eCRF flag ‘Select if (medication) taken prior to study’ will 
be used in addition.  
For previous pi[INVESTIGATOR_16347], recorded in the concomitant medication eCRF, 
missing month and day for the start year will be imputed with July 1st of the respective 
year. If the day is unknown, the 15th of the respective month will be imputed. Imputations 
will only be used for calculation of duration of previous pi[INVESTIGATOR_16347]. An 
imputation will only be applied if not artificially leading to a previous treatment period of 
more than 16 weeks.

STUDY DESIGN  
DESCRIPT
ION OF THE STUDY 
This is a multicenter, international, open-label, single-arm safety and tolerability study of 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_7735]/nintedanib combination treatment in patients with IPF who have been on a stable 
dose of pi[INVESTIGATOR_16326]. In this study, a stable pi[INVESTIGATOR_16354] 1602 –2403 mg/d (801 mg twice daily [BID] or three times daily [TID]). Up to 
approximately [ADDRESS_15677] 16 weeks and on a 
stable dose (1602 –2403 mg/d) for at least 28 days; also, the dose must be expected to remain 
within that range throughout the study. In addition, in the [ADDRESS_15678] experienced either a new or ongoing moderate or severe adverse reaction 
considered by [CONTACT_16420][INVESTIGATOR_7735], or an interruption of pi[INVESTIGATOR_16355] > 7 days for any reason. 
After providing informed consent and discussing the risks and benefits of the study with the 
Investigator, patients will be required to.taper and/or discontinue all prohibited medications 
(Section 4.4.2) at least 28 days before the start of Screening; this is the Washout Period. Patients 
will be instructed to continue their commercial pi[INVESTIGATOR_16356]. If a 
prohibited medication must be tapered, tapering must start early enough that the patient has 
discontinued the medication 28 days before the start of Screening. After completing Washout, 
patients will enter Screening, which lasts up to 21 days; during Screening, patients will be 
evaluated for eligibility based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Patients not taking a

pi[INVESTIGATOR_16358].  
During Screening, patients on a stable dose of pi[INVESTIGATOR_16359] 
(Study Day 1) as soon eligibility has been confirmed.  At this visit, they will have nintedanib added 
to the ongoing pi[INVESTIGATOR_16347].  Nintedanib dosing will start at 100 mg once daily (QD) and 
be titrated to 150 mg BID over 15 days, as tolerated, according to the schedule provided in 
protocol Error! Reference source not found. .  
The Sponsor will supply pi[INVESTIGATOR_16360]; nintedanib will be 
supplied in 100 mg and 150 mg capsules to facilitate temporary dose reduction if required for the 
management of AEs.  
Combination treatment will continue through Week 24, with monitoring by [CONTACT_16421]. Blood samples will be obtained from all patients for analysis of clinical 
laboratory value s. 
Patients will be encouraged to remain on stable doses of pi[INVESTIGATOR_7735] (1602 –2403 mg/d) and 
nintedanib (200 –300 mg/d) throughout the combination-treatment period, unless dosing is 
modified to manage an AE.  Patients will return to the clinic for a final Follow-up Visit 28 –35 days 
after the completion of combination treatment.  
If one or both study treatments are prematurely discontinued or interrupted for  
≥ 28 consecutive days, nintedanib treatment will end as will the patient’s participation in the study ; 
whether commercial pi[INVESTIGATOR_16361]. The patient will then return to the clinic as soon as possible (≤ 7 days after the 
decision to discontinue nintedanib) for an Early Discontinuation Visit. 
In addition, 28 –[ADDRESS_15680] that provides important information relevant to 
study participation. 
On completion of study participation, patients may be prescribed appropriate IPF treatment at 
the discretion of the treating physician. 
An independent Data Monitoring Committee (iDMC) will review safety data and advise on study 
conduct at least three times during the study: when the first approximately [ADDRESS_15681] 
completed 8 weeks of combination treatment or permanently discontinued study treatments, 
when approximately 50% of the total patient group has completed 12 weeks of combination 
treatment or permanently discontinued study treatments and when approximately 75% of the total 
patient group has completed 24 weeks of combination treatment or permanently discontinued 
study treatments. Additional ad hoc meetings or data reviews can be requested at any time by [CONTACT_16422], if warranted.

statistical hypotheses for efficacy will be assessed. The efficacy analyses will be limited to 
descriptive statistics.  
Data summaries will be provided for baseline characteristics; patient disposition; extent of 
exposure; the number and proportion of patients who complete 24 weeks on pi[INVESTIGATOR_16332] a 
dose of 1602 –2403 mg/d and nintedanib at a dose of 200 –300 mg/d (with 95% confidence 
interval [ CI]); the numbers and proportions of patients with a dose reduction or a dose interruption; 
the number and proportion of patients who discontinued combination treatment because of a AE 
(with 95% CI); the total number of days on combination treatment at an pi[INVESTIGATOR_16372] 1602 –
2403 mg/d and a nintedanib dose of 200 –300 mg/d; the total number of days from the start of 
combination treatment to discontinuation of one or both study treatments; the final prescribed 
doses of pi[INVESTIGATOR_16317]; and the reasons for premature discontinuation of 
combination treatment. 
AEs and SAEs leading to discontinuation will be summarized by [CONTACT_12035], severity, seriousness, 
and relationship to treatment. Additional summaries will be provided for the numbers and 
proportions of patients with a Major Adverse Cardiac Event (MACE), a cerebrovascular event, 
a bleeding event, or a thromboembolic event; the numbers and proportions of patients 
discontinuing combination treatment for a liver test abnormality, a GI event, or a photosensitivity 
reaction/rash; the numbers and proportions of patients with an emergency department visit or 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; and deaths. 
Observed and change values for clinical laboratory and vital signs data will be summarized. 
Grade 3 and 4 laboratory abnormalities will be summarized by [CONTACT_3229], and shift tables by 
[CONTACT_16425].

 45 ECG data will be summarized, presenting the numbers and proportions of patients with a 
maximum QTcF interval < 500 ms, 500 –550 ms, and > 550 ms; with a maximum change from the 
baseline QTcF interval of ≤ 30  ms, 31 –60 ms, and > 60 ms; and with ECG changes considered 
by [CONTACT_16426].  
DETERMINATION OF SAMPLE SIZE 
A sample size of approximately 80 patients was selected based on the AE discontinuation rates 
after one year observed in the randomized Phase 3 pi[INVESTIGATOR_16373] 2 and 3 nintedanib studies (pi[INVESTIGATOR_7735] 14.6%, nintedanib 21%; per the 2014 US labels). 
Given that for pi[INVESTIGATOR_16334] 24 weeks was 6%-8% in studies PI[INVESTIGATOR_16335]-004 
and PI[INVESTIGATOR_16335]-006 it is a reasonable assumption that the nintedanib discontinuation rate was around 
10% - 11%. As in this study of combination treatment, it is possible that the addition of nintedanib 
to ongoing pi[INVESTIGATOR_16374], given the overlap in the GI and hepatic effects of the two medications.  
Assuming 85% of the patients complete 24 weeks of combination treatment, a sample size of 80 
patients would be expected to yield an actual completion rate of 77.2% to 92.8% using a 95% CI

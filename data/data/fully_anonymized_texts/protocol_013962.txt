for subsequent disease progressi on (which occurred during the of f-treatment period) and 
administered for up to 1 additional year.
The 2 cycles of histology-based platinum doublet chemotherapy in  the treatment arm during 
induction are the same chemotherapy regimens as in the control a rm:
•Squamous histology: carboplatin AUC 6 + paclitaxel 200 mg/m2
•Non-squamous histology: carboplatin AUC 5 or 6 + p emetrexed 500 mg/m2 or cisplatin 
75 mg/m2+ pemetrexed 500 mg/m2. The investigator must decide prior to randomization 
whether or not the participant with non-squamous histology will re ceive cisplatin, if eligible.
Control arm : 4 cycles of histology -based platinum doublet chemotherapy.
•Squamous histology: carboplatin AUC 6 + paclitaxel 200 mg/m2
•Non-squamous histology: carboplat in AUC 5 or 6 + pemetrexed 500 mg/m2or cisplatin 
75 mg/m2+ pemetrexed 500 mg/m2. The investigator must decide prior to randomization 
whether or not the participant with non-squamous histology will re ceive cisplatin, if eligible.
•Chemotherapy will be on day 1 of each 3 week cycle; participants  with non-squamous 
histology who have stable disease or response after i nduction chemotherapy are per mitted to 
receive optional pemetrexed maintenance therapy: 500 mg/m2pemetrexed on day 1 of each 
3 week cycle until dis ease progression or unacceptable toxicity, or other reasons sp ecified in

•PD-L1 negative (< 1% tumor cell membrane staining in a minimum of a hundred evaluable 
tumor cells)
•PD-L1 not quantifiable (participants with tumor biopsy specimens  without quantifiable PD-L1 
expression)
Participants are to have tumor tissue sample available for PD-L1  IHC testing performed by a
central laboratory during screening peri od. PD-L1 s tatus is required for randomization. 
The enrollment will end when approximately 420 patients are ran domized. IWRS will be used to 
track the enrollment number. Testing of PD-L1 through a central laboratory is required prior to 
randomization. Participants tested but with not quantifiable PD -L1 will stratify with PD-L1 
negative participants. PD-L1 not  quantifiable population will b e capped to 10% of total 
randomized population. The study design schematic is presented in Figure 5.1-1.
Figure 5.1-1: Study Design Schematic
Approximately 420 participants w ill be ra ndomized in a 1:1 r atio to the treatment arm or control 
arm. The stratification factors for randomization are PD-L1 lev el (≥ 1% vs < 1%), histology
(squamous vs non-squamous histology), and gender (male vs female ). Participants without
quantifiable PD-L1 status can be stratified with PD-L1 < 1% pop ulation and capped to 10% of the 
total randomized participants. 
The investigator must decide prior to randomization if participa nt with non-squamous histology 
will receive cisplatin therapy, based on cisplatin eligibility c riteria.
Treatment Arm: Nivolumab will be administered with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], plus 2 cycles o f 
histology-based platinum doublet chemotherapy: 
•Squamous histology: carboplatin AUC 6 + paclitaxel 200 mg/m2
•Non-squamous histology: carboplat in AUC 5 or 6 + pemetrexed 500 m g/m2or

Details of the DMC responsibilities and procedures w ill be sp ecified in the DMC charter. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Blinded Independent Radiology Central Review 
Tumor assessments for each participant s hould be submitted to the radiology vendor as will be
performed on an ongoing basis. At the time of investigator-asse ssed initial radi ographic 
progression per RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_1108634] 1.1 criteria for progression will be provided to 
the site. Participants whose disease progression is not confirme d centrally will be required to 
continue tumor assessments (if clinically feasible) according t o the protocol-specified schedule. 
Subsequent tumor assessments must be submitted to the third par ty radiology vendor for 
subsequent review and may be discontinued when the investigator  and independent radiologists 
both assess the participant to have met RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_1108635] 1.1 response for 
analyses of ORR or PFS. Details of the BICR procedures will be sp ecified in the imaging manual.

6.4 Screen Failures
Screen failures are defined as participants who consent to part icipate in the clinical study but are 
not subsequently randomized. A minimal set of screen failure inf ormation is required to ensure 
transparent reporting of screen failure participants, to meet t he Consolidated Standards of 
Reporting Trials (CONSORT) publishing requirements, and to respond to queries from regulatory 
authorities. Minimal information in cludes date of consent, demo graphy, screen failure details, 
eligibility criteria, and any serious AEs.
6.4.1 Retesting During Screening Period
This study permits the re-enro llment of a p articipant that has d iscontinued the study as a 
pre-treatment f ailure (ie, participant has not b een randomized / has not been t reated). If re-e nrolled, 
the participant must be re-consented
Retesting of laboratory parameters and/or other assessments with in any single screening will be 
permitted (in addition to any parameters that require a confirm atory value).
The most current result prior to randomization is the value by [CONTACT_35853], as it represents the participant’s most current, clin ical state.

7.1.3 Treatment Beyond Disease Progression 
Accumulating evidence indicates a  minority of participants treat ed with immunotherapy may 
derive clinical benefit despi[INVESTIGATOR_43840] .21
Participants will be permitted to continue on nivolumab + ipi[INVESTIGATOR_803161] t beyond init ial 
RECIST 1.1 defined PD as long as they meet the following criter ia:
•Investigator-assessed clinical benefit and no rapid disease pro gression
•Participant is toler ating study treatment
•Stable performance status
•Treatment beyond progression will not d elay an imminent intervention to prevent serious 
complications of disease progression (eg, CNS metastases)
•Participant provides wri tten informed consent prior to receiving additional nivolumab a nd 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_551227], using an ICF describing any reasonably foreseeable ris ks or 
discomforts, or other alternative treatment options.
The decision to continue tr eatment be yond initial investigator-assessed progression s hould be 
discussed with the BMS Medical Monitor and documented in the st udy records. A follow-up scan 
should be performed within six (6) weeks ±7 days of original PD to determine whether there has 
been a decrease in the tumor size, or continued progression of disease. Subsequent scans should 
be performed per protocol defined schedule ±7 days until further progression is determined.
If the investigator feels that the participant continues to achi eve clinical benefit by [CONTACT_166862], the p articipant should remain on t he trial and contin ue to receive monitoring according 
to the Time and Events Schedule in Section 2 .
For the participants who continue study therapy beyond progress ion, further progression is defined 
as an additional 10% increase in tumor burden from time of init ial PD. This includes an increase 
in the sum of diameters of all target lesions and/ or the diame ters of new measurable lesions 
compared to the time of initial PD. Nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_803162].

15 mm). Any new lesion considered non-measureable at the time of  initial progression may 
become measureable and therefore included in the tumor burden if the longest diameter increases 
to at least 10 mm (except for pathological lymph nodes which mu st have a short axis of at least 
15 mm). In situations where the relative increase in total tumor burden by 10% is solely due to 
inclusion of new lesions which become measurable, these new les ions must demonstrate an 
absolute increase of at least 5 mm.
7.2 Method of Treatment Assignment
After the participant’s initial eligibility is established and informed consent has been obtained, the 
participant must be enrolled i nto the study by [CONTACT_803188] (IWRS) 
to obtain the participant number. Every participant that signs t he informed consent form must be 
assigned a participant number in IWRS. Specific instructions for  using IWRS will be provided to 
the investigational site in a separate document. The investigat or or designee will register the 
participant for enrollment by [CONTACT_803189] s established by [CONTACT_20444]. The 
following information is required for enrollment:
•Date that informed consent was obtained
•Participant number
•Date of birth
Participants enrolled will be grouped according to PD-L1 status (positive, negative, or not 
quantifiable, using membranous staining in ≥1% tumor cells v s membranous staining in < 1% 
tumor cells). PD-L1 expression dat a will be transferred directl y from analyzing lab to IWRS. 
IWRS will be used to track the enrollment number.
Once enrolled in IWRS, enrolled  participants that have met all eligibility criteria will be
randomized through IWRS. The followi ng information is required for participant randomization:
•Participant number
•Date of birth
•Gender
•Histology (squamous or non-squamous). 
−Participants with mixed histol ogy should be cla ssified according to the predominant 
histology. 
−Participants with adenosquamous histology should be classified a s non-squamous 
histology.
•PD-L1 status
•Will particip ant be treated with cisplatin, if eligible?
Participants meeting all eligibility criteria will be stratified by [CONTACT_109800] (squ amous vs 
non-squamous), gender (male vs female), and PD-L1 level (< 1% v s ≥ 1% expression levels) 
Participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to treatment and  control arms.

local labeling for the chemotherapy drugs being administered to  any given participant for  
additional guidance on dose delays.
•Participants receiving cisplatin with pemetrexed must discontin ue cisplatin if the calculated  
creatinine clearance decreases to < 50 mL/min (based on the Coc kroft Gault formula). The  
other drug (pemetrexed) may be continued, and the platinum agen t may, at the investigator’s 
discretion, be switched to carboplatin for the rest of cycles w hen the participant meets

•If any non-h ematologic a dverse event meeting the dose delay criteria above is felt to be related  
to only one particular agent in the platinum doublet chemothera py regimen, then that agent  
alone may be omitted for that cycle while the other agent is gi ven. In order to maintain  
synchronized dosing of the reg imen, the omitted a gent should be  resumed with the next  
scheduled cycle once the AE has  improved and retreatment criter ia are met. Please refer to  
Section [IP_ADDRESS] to determin e if dose reduction of the resumed agent is required.
•If both drugs in the platinum doublet chemotherapy regimen are delayed, then the participant

[IP_ADDRESS] Chemotherapy - Dose Reductions for Non-Hematologic Toxicities 
Dose adjustments for chemotherapy for non-hematol ogic toxicitie s during treatment are described  
in Section [IP_ADDRESS] . All dose reductions should be made based on the worst grade t oxicity.  
Participants experiencing any of the toxicities during the previ ous cycle should have their  
chemotherapy delayed until retr eatment cr iteria are met and then reduced for all subsequent cycles  
by 1 dose level or discontinued as appropriate. Dose levels for  the two drugs in the  
platinum-doublet chemotherapy regimen are not linked and may be  reduced independently, as  
summarized in Table [IP_ADDRESS]-1.

[IP_ADDRESS] Permitted Therapy
Participants are permitted the use of topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855], ocular, intra-art icular, intranasal, and inhalational 
corticosteroids (with  minimal systemic absorpti on). Adrenal rep lacement steroid doses > 10 mg 
daily prednisone are permitted. A brief (less than 3 weeks) cou rse of corticosteroids for 
prophylaxis (eg, contrast dye allergy) or for treatment of non- autoimmune conditions 
(eg, delayed-type hypersensitivity r eaction cause d by a contact [CONTACT_20435]) is permitted.
Regular concomitant use of bisphosphonates and RANK-L inhibitor s for prevention or reduction 
of skeletal-related events in pati ents with bone metastases is a llowed if initiated prior to first dose 
of study therapy. Prior palliative radiotherapy must have been completed at least 2 weeks prior to 
treatment.
[IP_ADDRESS] Palliative Local Therapy
Palliative local therapy, including palliative radiation therapy - and palliative surgical resection, to 
symptomatic non-target bone lesions, skin lesions, or CNS lesio ns is permitted prior to 
discontinuation of study treatment for participants who do not have evidence of overall clinical or 
radiographic progression per RE CIST 1.1. P alliative local therapy to lesions causing hemoptysis 
may also be permitted prior to discont inuation of study treatme nt in participants who do not have 
evidence of overall clinical or radiographic progression per RE CIST 1.1, provided that the lesions 
undergoing palliative local therapy are not the only sites of m easurable disease and the case is 
discussed with and approved by [CONTACT_102440].
Participants requiring palliative local therapy should be evalu ated for objective evidence of disease 
progression prior to the initiation of such therapy, particular ly if the most recent tumor assessment 
was more than [ADDRESS_1108683] meet criteria to continue 
treatment beyond progression ( Section 7.1.3 ) in order to resume imm unotherapy after palliative

required for a tumor lesion, th en nivolumab/ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] s hould b e withheld for at least 1 week 
before, during, and 1 week after radiation. Participants should  be closely monitored for any 
potential toxicity during and after receiving radiotherapy, and  AEs should resolve to Grade 
≤ 1 prior to resuming nivolumab or nivolumab plus ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125].
[IP_ADDRESS] Imaging Restriction and Precautions
It is the local imagi ng facility’s respons ibility to determine,  based on participant attributes 
(eg, allergy history, diabetic history and renal s tatus), the appropr iate imaging mod ality and 
Date: 10-May-[ADDRESS_1108685] enhanced MRI of the abdomen and pelvis may be obtained.
Specific to MRI, participants with severe renal insufficiency (i e, estimated glomerular filtration 
rate (eGFR) < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2) are at increased risk of ne phrogenic systemic  fibrosis. MRI 
contrast should not be given to this participant population. In addition, participants are excluded 
from MRI if they have tattoos, metallic implants, pacemakers, etc. The ultimate decision to 
perform MRI in an individual participant in this study rests wit h the site radiologist, the 
investigator and the standard set by [CONTACT_61857].7.8 Treatment After the End of the Study
At the end of the study, BMS will not continue  to provide BMS s upplied study treatment to 
participants/investigators unless BMS chooses to extend the study. The investigator should ensure 
that the participant receives appropriate standard of care to tr eat the condition under study.
BMS reserves the right to terminate access to BMS supplied stud y treatment if any of the following 
occur: a) the study is terminated due to safety concerns; b)the development of the nivolumab or 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_102359], including but not li mited to lack of efficacy and/or not 
meeting the study objectives; c)  the participant can obtain medi cation from a government 
sponsored or private health program. In all cases BMS will foll ow local regulations
8 DISCONTINUATION CRITERIA
8.1 Discontinuation from Study Treatment
For all participants, global d eterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of trea tment 
without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be reported as ‘symptomatic 
deterioration’ in the s ource data and in the case report form. Tumor assessments f or participants 
who discontinue study treatment without radiographic progressio n, confirmed by [CONTACT_19377]
(Section [IP_ADDRESS] ), should continue as per protocol until radiographic progressi on is determined by 
[CONTACT_19375].
If participant is intolerant of nivolumab treatment during the chemotherapy cycles, participant
should be withdrawn from the treatment phase of the study.
Chemotherapy dose reduction i s allowed on study. Any participant with two prior dose reductions 
to one agent who experiences a toxicity that would cause a thir d dose reduction must be 
discontinued from that agent. A  participant in tr eatment arm who  is discontinued from the 
chemotherapy treatment will remain on the study and receive nivo lumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_803169] (non-squamous histology only).

CA2099LA Imaging Charter to be provided by [CONTACT_50338]. 
9.1.1 Methods of Measurements
The following imaging assessments should be performed at pre-sp ecified intervals: CT of the 
chest, CT or MRI of the abdomen, pelvis, and other known sites of disease.
•Baseline assessment must occur prior to dosing
•CT scans should be acquired with s lice thickness of 5 mm or less with no intervening gap 
(continuous) 
•Should a par ticipant have a contraindicatio n for CT IV contrast, a non-contrast CT of the chest 
and a contrast enhanced MRI of the abdomen and pelvis and other  sites of disease may be 
obtained. MRIs s hould be ac quired with slice thickness of 5 mm or less with no gap 
(continuous).
•Every attempt should be made to image each participant using an  identical acquisition protocol 
on the same scanner for all imaging time points. 
NOTE: Use of CT component of a PET/CT scanner: Combined modalit y scanning, such as with 
FDG-PET/CT, is increasingly used  in clinical care and is a moda lity/technology that is in rapid 
evolution; therefore, the recommendations outlined here may cha nge rather quickly with time. If 
a site can document that the CT performed as part of a FDG-PET/ CT is of identical dia gnostic 
quality to a diagnostic CT (with IV contrast), then the CT port ion of the FDG-PET/CT can be used 
for RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_1108708] 1.1 response in target lesions. 
In selected circumstances where such modalities are the sole mo dality used to assess certain non -
target organs, those non-target organs may be evaluated less fr equently. For example, bone scans 
may need to be repeated only when  complete re sponse is identifi ed in target disease or when 
progression in bone is suspected.
Date: 10-May-[ADDRESS_1108709], abdomen, pelvis, and brain (to rule o ut brain metastases), all known sites 
of disease should be assessed at baseline. Subsequent assessmen ts should include chest, abdomen, 
pelvis, and all known sites of disease using the same imaging m ethod and technique as was used 
at baseline. 
Radiographic tumor response will be assessed at week 6 (± 7 days) from first dose date, then every 
6 weeks (± 7 days) for the first 12 months (until Week 48) and every 12 weeks (± 7 days) thereafter, 
until disease progression is documented or treatment is discont inued (whichever occurs later). 
Participants with a history of brain metastasis may have surveillance MRI approximately every 12 
weeks (± 7 days) from the d ate of first dose, or sooner if clinically indicated.
Tumor assessments for each participant s hould be submitted to the radiology vendor, as they are 
performed on an ongoing basis. The blinded, independent radiolo gists will review all av ailable 
tumor assessments for that given participant and determine if RE CIST 1.[ADDRESS_1108710] 
1.1 criteria for progression will be provided to the site. Part icipants whose disease progression is 
not confirmed centrally will be required to continue tumor asse ssments (if clinically feasible) 
according to the protocol-specified schedule. 
The BICR will also rev iew tumor images in all tr eated participants to determine RECIST 1.1 
response for the analyses of ORR and PFS. Details of the BICR responsibilities and procedures 
will be specified in the BICR charter.
[IP_ADDRESS] Assessment of Baseline Tumor Assessment
Screening/baseline imaging (ie, CT of the chest, CT or MRI of the  abdomen, pelvis, and other 
known sites of disease) should be submitted to the imaging core  lab. MRI preferred or CT scan of 
the brain should be performed w ithin 28 days of randomization and submitted to the imaging core 
lab. 
[IP_ADDRESS] BICR Assessment of Progression
Sites should submit all scans to BICR on a rolling basis, preferably within 7 days of scan 
acquisition, th roughout the durati on of the study. BICR will re view scans on a rolling basis and 
remain blinded to treatment arm a nd investigator assessment of submitted scans. When progression 
is diagnosed by [CONTACT_8647], the site will i nform the imag ing core lab, so that the BICR 
assessment of progression can be performed. 
Participants whose progression is not confirmed by [CONTACT_790640] l be required to continue tumor 
assessments (if clinically feasible) according to the protocol- specified schedule or sooner if 
clinically indicated until the BICR confirms progression on a s ubsequent tumor assessment. Also, 
if participants discontinue treatment without radiographic prog ression, tumor assessments will 
continue according to the protocol specified schedule, as noted in Section 2 , until progression has 
been confirmed by [CONTACT_19377].

perspective and offers insights into the patient experience tha t may not be captured through 
physician reporting. Generic h ealth related quality of life s cales additionally  provide data 
necessary in calculat ing utility values for h ealth economic mod els. In this study, the EQ-5D (EQ-
5D-3L) will be co llected in order to assess the impact of study treatment on gen eric health related 
quality of life, which will also be used in populating health econo mic models most notably, cost 
effectiveness analysis. The Lung Cancer Symptom Scale (LCSS) wi ll be collected to assess the 
impact of study treatment on patient reported disease-related s ymptoms.
The EQ-5D is a standardized instrument for use as a measure of s elf-reported h ealth statu s. The 
EQ-5D includes a 5-dimension  descriptive system as w ell as a visual anal og rating s cale ( VAS). 
The EQ-5D descriptive system is comprised of the following 5-dimensions: mobility, self-care, 
usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Util ity data generated from the EQ-5D
3L are recommended for use in cost effectiveness analysis. The EQ-5D VAS records the participant’s self-rated h ealth s tatus on a 100-point ver tical visual anal ogue scale (0=worst 
imaginable health state, 100 = best imaginable h ealth s tate).
The LCSS is a validated instrument designed to assess the impact  of treatment on disease-related 
symptoms. It consists of 6 symptom-specific questions related to dyspnea, cough, fatigue, pain, hemoptysis and anorexia plus 3 summary items: symptom distress, interference with activity, and global health related quality of life (HRQoL). The questionnair e uses a 24-hour recall period. For 
the six individual symptom measures, the degree of impairment i s recorded on a [ADDRESS_1108712] score. The LCSS average 
symptom burden index (ASBI) can be derived as the average of sc ores for the six symptom-related 
items. A clinically meaningful change in ASBI score has been de fined as 10 points.
9.2 Adverse Events
The definitions of an AE or serious adverse event (SAE) can be found in Appendix 3 .
AEs will be reported by [CONTACT_2299] (or, when appropriate, by a caregiver, surrogate, or the 
participant's legally a uthorized repre sentative). 
The investigator and any designees are responsible for detectin g, documenting, and reporting 
events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE and remain resp onsible for following up AEs that 
are serious, considered related to the study treatment or the s tudy, or that caused the participant to 
discontinue before completing the study. 
Contacts for SAE reporting specified in Appendix 3
9.2.1 Time Period and Frequency for Collecting AE and SAE Information
The collection of nonserious AE information s hould begin at init iation of study treatment and

Information to determine expectedness of serious adverse events  for expedited reporting. 
Following the participant’s written consent to par ticipate in the study, all SAEs, whether related 
or not related to stud y drug, must be co llected, including thos e thought to be associated with 
protocol-specified procedures.
All SAEs must be collected that occur during the screening period (after signing the consent) and 
within [ADDRESS_1108713] be collected that relate to any later pro tocol-specified procedure (eg, a 
follow-up skin biopsy).
The investigator must report any SAE that occurs after these ti me periods and that is believed to 
be related to study drug or protocol-specified procedure.
•Medical occurrences that begi n before the start of study treatm ent but after obtaining informed 
consent will be recorded on the appropriate section of the eCRF section.

Investigators are not obligated  to actively seek AEs or SAEs in  former study participants. 
However, if the investigator learns of any SAE, including a dea th, at any time after a participant 
has been discharged from the study, and he/she considers the event reasonably related to the study 
treatment or study participation, t he investigator must promptl y notify the sponsor.
The method of evaluating, and assessing caus ality of AEs and SAEs and the procedures for 
completing and reporting/transmitting SAE reports are provided in Appendix 3.
9.2.2 Method of Detecting AEs and SAEs
Adverse events can be spontaneously reported  or elicited  during open-ended questioning, 
examination, or evaluation of a participant. (In order to preve nt reporting bias, pa rticipants should 
not be questioned regarding the specific occurrence of one or more AEs.)
9.2.3 Follow-up of AEs and SAEs
•Nonserious AEs should be follo wed to resolution  or stabilizatio n, or reported as SAEs if they 
become serious (see Section Appendix 3).
•Follow-up is also required for nonserious AEs that cause interr uption or discontinuation of 
study treatment and for those present at the end of study treatm ent as appropriate.
•All identified nonserious AEs must be recorded and described on  the nonserious AE page of 
the CRF (paper or electronic). Completion of supplemental CRFs may be requested for AEs 
and/or laboratory abnormalities that are reported/identified du ring the course of the study.

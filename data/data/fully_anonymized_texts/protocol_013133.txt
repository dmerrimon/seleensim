1.1. Synopsis
A Phase 2a Randomized, Double- blind, Active -controlled, Parallel -group, Multicenter, Proof -of-concept 
Clinical Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Combination Therapy  With Guselkumab and 
Golimumab in Participants With Moderately to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis
Protocol number: CNTO1959UCO2002
EudraCT Number: 2018-001510-15
Guselkumab (CNTO 1959 or TREMFYA®) is a fully human immunog lobulin G1 lambda monoclonal 
antibody (mAb) that binds to the p19 subunit of human interleukin (IL)-23 with high specificity and 
affinity. The binding of guselkumab to IL-23 blocks the binding of extracellular IL-23 to the cell surface 
IL-23 receptor, inhibiting IL-23-specific intracellular signaling and subsequent activation and cytokine 
production. Guselkumab is currently approved in the U nited States, European Union, C anada, and several 
other countries for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psori asis. In addition, guselkumab is also 
being evaluated in psoriatic arthritis ( PsA)and Crohn’s disease globally.
Golimumab (CNTO 148 or SIMPONI®) is a fully human anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) mAb 
that binds to TNFα with high affinity. This interaction prevents the binding of TNFα to its receptors, 
thereby [CONTACT_676454]α. Golimumab is approved for treatment of moderately to 
severely active ulcerative colitis (UC) in over 90 countries worldwide. Additionally, golimumab is 
approved for 1 or more of the following indications around the world: rheumatoid arthritis (RA), PsA, 
ankylosing spondylitis (AS) , nonradiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-Axial SpA), and polyarticular 
juvenile idiopathic arthritis (pJIA ).

at Week 6), and conc omitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_676413]. Initiation of prohibited therapi[INVESTIGATOR_676414].
Endoscopy with central read is planned for screening/baseli ne, Week 12, and Week 38. Consenting 
participants will have an additional endoscopy at Week 4, which will also be assessed by a central reader. 
Efficacy, PK and PD parameters, biomarkers, and safety will be assessed according to the Schedule of 
Activities (SoA). A pharmacogenomic blood sample will be collected from participants who consent to 
this component of the protocol (where local regulations permit ). Participation in pharmacogenomic 
research is optional.
An interim analysis is planned to inform future clinical development. Database locks(DBL s) are planned 
at Weeks 12 and 38, and a final DBL is planned after all participants complete the safety follow -up visit. 
An independent D ata Monitoring Committee (DMC) will be commissioned for this study . 
NUMBER OF PARTICIPANTS
A target of 210participants will be enrolled in this study with [ADDRESS_914667] phases: a 12-week combination comparison phase followed by a 26-
week monotherapy phase . At Week 0, atarget of 210 participants will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to 
either combination therapy with guselkumab and golimumab, guselkumab monotherapy, or golimumab 
monotherapy, stratified by [CONTACT_676461] (Y/N) .Participants 
randomized to combination therapy will receive guselkumab monotherapy after Week 12. Participants 
randomized to a monotherapy group will continue on their originally randomized monotherapy after 
Week 12. The combination therapy arm will employ the same dose regimens of guselkumab and 
golimumab being used in the respective monotherapy intervention groups to facilitate scientific 
interpretation of the results. The following is a description of the 3 interventio n groups:
 Combination therapy : guselkumab 200 mgIVand golimumab 200 mg subcutaneous (SC)at 
Week 0; golimumab 100 mg SC at Weeks 2, 6, and 10; guselkumab 200 mg IV at Weeks 4 and 8 
followed by [CONTACT_676462] 100 mg SC q8w
 Guselkumab monotherapy : guselkumab 200 mg IV at Weeks 0, 4, and 8 followed by [CONTACT_676462] 
100 mg SC q8w
 Golimumab monotherapy : golimumab 200 mg SC injection at Week 0, followed by [CONTACT_676463] 
100 mg at Week 2 and then golimumab 100 m gevery 4 weeks (q4w)
In addition, placebo administrations (IVor SC) will be given, as appropriate, to maintain the blind 
throughout the duration of the study.
Overall participant duration will be up to 58 weeks total (screening: up to 8 weeks; treatment duration: 38 
weeks [12 weeks for the combination comparison phase; 26 weeks for the monotherapy phase]; safety 
follow -up: approximately [ADDRESS_914668] administration of study intervention at Week 34). The 
end of the study will be defined as when the last participant completes his or her final safety follow -up 
visit.

Approved , Date: 7 March 2019EFFICACY EVALUATIONS
Efficacy evaluations will include the following:
 Mayo score and Partial Mayo score
 Ulcerative Colitis Endoscopic Index of Severity (UCEIS)
 Inflammatory PD markers including CRP and fecal calprotectin
 Patient- reported outcome measures to assess HRQOL outcomes and fatigue (ie, Inflammatory Bowel 
Disease Questionnaire [IBDQ] , Patient -Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System 
[PROMIS] -29, and PROMIS Fatigue 7- item Short Form [7a])
 Exploratory patien t-reported symptom measures including BSFS andPGIC of Severity of UC
PHARMACOKINETIC AND IMMUNOGENICITY E VALUATIONS
Serum samples will be analyzed to determine concentrations of guselkumab and golimumab and detection 
of anti-guselkumab and anti-golimumab antibodies, respectively, using validated, specific, and sensitive 
immunoassay methods by [CONTACT_43754]. 
PHARMACODYNAMIC AND BIOMARKER EVALUATIONS
Biomarker assessments will be made to examine the biologic response to treatment and to identify 
biomarkers that are relevant to guselkumab and/or golimumab in the treatment of UC. Assessments will 
include the evaluation of relevant biomarkers in serum, stool,whole blood, and mucosal biopsy samples
(RNA [ribonucleic acid] ,peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), histology , and single cell 
isolation) .
PHARMACOGENOMIC (DNA) EVALUATIONS
A pharmacogenomic whole blood sample of approximately 5 mL will be collected (where local 
regulations permit) for genetic analyses as specified in the SoA. Only participants who sign the consent 
form to participate in the genetic assessment will have whole blood deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA )
samples collected. Participation in the pharmacogenomic sub -study is optional.
SAFETY EVALUATIONS
Safety evaluations conducted at each study visit will include the assessment of adverse events (AEs, at the 
visit and those occurring between evaluation visits), a tuberculosis (TB) evaluation and other infection 
assessment, clinical laboratory blood tests ( hematology and chemistry), vital signs, suicidality assessment, 
concomitant medication review, observations for injection- site reactions, AEs temporally associated with 
infusion, and/or hypersensitivity reactions.
STATISTICAL METHODS
Sample Size Determination
A sample size of 210 participants (70 per intervention group) was determined by [CONTACT_676464] a 
significant difference in the proportion of participants inclinical response at Week 12 (primary endpoint) 
between the combination therapy and both monotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_133825] a 1-sided chi-square test with 0.1 
significanc e level for each comparison. The study is sized such that thecombination therapy has
approximately 80% power based on simulations to achieve both comparisons to monotherapy for the 
primary endpoint .The proportion of participants in clinical response at W eek 12 is assumed to be 75% for 
the combination therapy, which is based on the additive effect from both monotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (20% 
improvement from each monotherapy relative to a historical placebo response of 35%).

efficacy analyses . Participants will be analyzed according to the treatment group to which they were 
randomized regardless of the treatment they received.
For testing of the primary endpoint, the efficacy of combination therapy versus each monotherapy will be 
compared. For both statistical comparisons of the primary endpoint, a Cochran -Mantel- Haenszel (CMH)
chi-square test stratified by [CONTACT_676465] (Y/N) will be used. The testing  
will be done simultaneously at the 1-sided 0.[ADDRESS_914670] (1-sided) stratified by 
[CONTACT_676465] (Y/N) will be used to compare the efficacy of the 
combination therapy to each monotherapy for the major secondary endpoint. The testing will be done 
simultaneously at the 1 -sided 0.1 level of significance for each comparison.
Analyses for other efficacy endpoints will be performed with no adjustments made for multiple 
comparisons and nominal p -values will be provided.
Safety Analyses
Safety data, including but not limited to, AEs, serious adverse events ( SAEs ), infections, serious 
infections, and changes in laboratory assessments will be summarized. Treatment -emergent AEs will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_676466] (MedDRA) system 
organ class and preferred terms.
Other Analyses
Pharmacokinetic Analyses 
Serum guselkumab and golimumab concentrations over time will be summarized for each treatment 
group using descriptive statistics.

a. Screening should occur w ithin 8 w eeks before the W0 visit. Visit dates are based on t he participant’ s original 
randomization date; visit window s are as follows: d ay of the scheduled visit ±4 days (ie, plus or minus 4 days). 
b. All assessments are to be completed before study intervention administrati on, unless otherwise specified; PRO 
assessments should be com pleted first. At the screening visit, the C -SSRS should be completed as the first assessment 
after signing informed consent and before any other tests, procedures, or other consultations. When blood samples are to 
be collected for safety, PK, efficacy, and biomarkers evaluations at the same time point, the order of blood draw s will be 
samples for CRP , hematology and chemistry, PK/i mmuno genicity, serum biomarkers, whole blood DNA (for those 
participating in the optional pharmacogenom ic sub -study at Week 0) , and w hole blood RNA.
c. Participants who discontinue study intervention (but have not terminated study participation) before W12 visit should 
complete the W12 assessments at the time of discontinuation and a safety follow -up visit (see Table 2) approximately 
16weeks after their last study intervention administration .
d. Subjects who terminate their study participation before the W12 v isit should complete the W12 assessments at the time 
of termination (which will serve as the early termination visit).
e. For participants who are receiving oral corticosteroids, the investigator must begin tapering the daily dose of 
corticosteroid s at W6.
f. Participants randomized to combination therapy will receive guselkumab monotherapy after W 12.  Participants 
randomized to a monotherapy group will continue on their originally ra ndom ized monotherapy after W 12.
g. Must be signed before first study -related activity.
h. The required source documentation to support meeting the enrollment criteria are noted in Appendix 6[Section 10.6], 
Regulatory, Ethical, and Study Oversi ght Considerations. Check clinical status again before first dose of study 
intervention.
i. All participants will undergo QuantiFERON®-TB testing. If the QuantiFERON®-TB test is not approved/registered in the 
country in which this protocol is being conducted or the tuberculin skin test is mandated by [CONTACT_72952] , a 
negative tuberculin skin test result (see Appendi x 3[Section 10.3]) is also required. In Ukraine, while the 
QuantiFERON®-TB test is not approved/registered, it is accepted, and a tuberculin skin test is not required.
j. Chest radiograph (posterior -anterior and lateral views, or per country regulations where applicable) must be obtained 
within 3 months be fore the W0 visit. Note: A chest CT scan is also acceptable in place of a chest radiograph.
k. Must be performed before any study intervention administration for female participants of childbearing potential. 
l. Stool studies for enteric pathogens may be perfor med at either the central or local laboratory and must include a stool 
culture and Clostridium difficile toxin assay. These tests must be performed during screening or have been performed 
during the current epi[INVESTIGATOR_676415] (as long as the stool studies were performed w ithin [ADDRESS_914673] administration of study intervention). Additional testing (eg, ova a nd parasites or Escherichia coli O157:H7

assessments) may be performed at the investigator’s clinical discretion. 
m. Participants should be instructed to bring their diaries to each study visit for review .
n. Endoscopy findings will be assessed by [CONTACT_32595] (ie, local endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_541]) during the procedure and a video of the 
endoscopy must be submitted to the central reader. 
o. The screening endoscopy must be performed within 2 weeks of the baseline ( W0)visit. The interval from the endoscopy 
procedure to the av ailability of the Mayo end oscopy subscore is approximately 4 days; therefore, the screening 
endoscopy must be performed at least 4 days before the baseline (W0) visit. The Mayo endoscopy subscore obtained 
during the central review of the video endoscopy will be used to determine eligibility (ie, Mayo endoscopy subscore ≥2) 
and to calculate the baseline Mayo score. A full colonoscopy will replace a sigmoidoscopy if screening for polyps or 
dysplasia is required. At least [ADDRESS_914674] radiograph (or chest CT scan if obtained instead) and QuantiFERON®-TB test 
should be performed. In countries where the QuantiFERON®-TB test is not registered/approved or the tuberculin skin 
test is mandated by [CONTACT_72952] , TB sk in testing (see Appendix 3 [Section 10.3]) should also be performed . 
Note: In Ukraine, while the QuantiFERON®-TB test is not approved/registered, it is accepted and a tu berculin skin test is 
not required. 
r. Temperature, pulse/heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and blood pressure. At a study intervention administration visit, vital 
signs should be obtained before, approximately every 30 minutes during, and twice (at approximatel y 30-minute 
intervals) after completion of the IV infusion(s), or before and approximately [ADDRESS_914675] assessment after s igning informed consent and before 
any other tests, procedures, or other consultations. For subsequent visits, the C -SSRS should be completed after all PROs 
and before any other tests, procedures, or other consultations.
t. For all visits where study interven tion will be administered , 1blood sample should be collected prior to study 
intervention administration for evaluation of serum concentrations and/or antibodies to interventions. In addition, for IV 
infusion -related visits (ie, Weeks 0, 4, and 8), another blood draw  should be taken approximately [ADDRESS_914676] the actual dates and times of PK sample collections.
u. Mucosal biopsy samples will be collected from all participants during endoscopy for RNA expression analysis ,
histologic assessment , and single cell isolation .
v. The screening biopsy samples for histology , RNA analyses , and single cell isolation will be collected from all 
participants during the screening endoscopy performed within 2 w eeks of the baseline ( W0)visit.

Guselkumab (CNTO 1959 or TREMFYA®)is a fully  human immunoglobulin G(IgG) 1 lambda
monoclonal antibody  (mAb) that binds to the p19 subunit of human interleukin (IL)-23 with high 
specificit y and affinity . The binding of guselkumab to IL-23blocks the binding of extracellular
IL-23 to the cell surface IL-23 receptor , inhibiting IL-23-specific intracellular signaling and 
subsequent activation and cytokin e production. In this manner, guselkumab inhibits the 
biological activity  of IL -23 in all in vitro assay s examined.
Guselkumab is currentl y approved in the U nited States (US) ,European Union ( EU), Canada, and 
several other countries for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. Clinical 
programs in non-plaque form psoriasis ( generalized pustular psoriasis [GPP] , erythrodermic 
psoriasis [EP],and palmoplantar pustulosis [PPP])are being conducted in Japan only and Japan 
recentl y approved guselkumab for the treatment of patients with psoriasis, GPP, EP, and 
psoriatic arthritis (PsA). In addition, guselkumab is also being evaluated in PsA and Crohn’s 
disease gl oball y. 
Golimumab (CNTO 148 or SIMPONI®) is a fully  human anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha 
(TNFα) mAb that binds to TNFα with high affinity . This interaction prevents the binding of 
TNFα to its receptors, thereby  [CONTACT_676467]α. The overall anti-TNFα 
activity  results in limited production or activity of inflammatory  cytokines, thereb y providing 
therapeutic benefit in various chronic inflammatory disorders, including ulcerative colitis ( UC).
Golimumab has demonstrated an acceptable benefit/risk profile and is approved for treatment of 
modera tely to severel y active UC in over 90countries worldwide. Additionally , golimumab is 
approved for 1 or more of the following indications around the world:  rheumatoid arthritis ( RA), 
PsA, anky losing spondy litis (AS) , non radiographic axial spondy loarthritis (nr-Axial SpA), and 
polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (pJIA).

2.1. Study Rational e
Ulcerative colitis is an inflammatory  disorder which involves the surface mucosa, the crypt 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_2130], and submucosa of the colon.57Clinically, patients with UC suffer from diarrhea, 
rectal bleeding, weight loss, abdominal pain, fever, and may also display  prominent 
extraintestinal manifestations, commonly  colitic arthritis, and AS.57The goals of UC treatment in 
general are the induction and maintenance of remission of symptoms to provide an improved 
quality  of lif e, reduction in need for long -term corticosteroids, and minimization of cancer risk.[ADDRESS_914677] revol utionized the clinical management

for more effective therapie s.10,24,35Biologic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_676416] -term 
remission rates of <20%.10,24,35A therapeutic approach of targeting multiple pathogenic pathway s 
may be required to achieve higher rates of clinical remission. Emerging evidence suggests that 
targeting both TNFα and IL-[ADDRESS_914678] s may result in greater clinical efficacy  (Section 2.1.2 ). 
Given thewell-established scientific and clinical rationale for each monot herap y in IBD, the 
unmet medical need for more efficacious therapi[INVESTIGATOR_676417] , and the expected clinical 
benefit of combination therapy ,this Phase 2a proof -of-concept ( POC )clinical study  will evaluate 
the efficacy and safety of short -term (ie, approximately 12 weeks ) combination therapy  with 
guselkumab and golimuma b compared to either guselkumab or golimumab alone in the treatment 
of patients with moderately  to severel y active UC.
2.1.1. Rationale for Use of Guselkumab in Ulcerative Colitis
[IP_ADDRESS]. Nonclinical Evidence Implicating IL -23 as a Target in Ulcerative 
Colitis
The involvement of the IL-12/[ADDRESS_914679] implicated several genetic loci in the IL-12/[ADDRESS_914680]  
that are associated with susceptibility  to UCand Crohn’s disease , includin gthe IL-23receptor , 
the IL-12B subunit , Janus kinase (JAK) 2, and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 
genes .4,9,12,28Early  nonclinical studies showed that treatment with an anti-IL-12/23p40 mAb 
abrogated or prevented disease in murine models of intestinal inflammation .29,34Subsequent 
studies dissecting the rolesof IL-12p35, IL-12/23p40 ,and IL-23p19 demonstrated a key role for 
IL-[ADDRESS_914681] that the efficacy  obtained with 
IL-12/23p40 blockade may be through the inhibition of IL-23 and provide a strong rationale for 
inhibiting only  IL-23in IBD. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Clinical Evidence Establishing Proof -of-Concept for IL -23 Targeted 
Therapy  in Ulcerative Colitis
Clinical POC has been established for anti-IL-23 mAbs in both Crohn’s disease and 
UC.14,15,46,47,49In a recently  reported Phase 2 study, mirikizumab (anti -IL-23 mAb) demonstrated 
efficacy  in the induction treatment for patients with moderately  to severel y active UC, as 
assessed by  [CONTACT_676468].46Overall AE frequencies were similar 
for mirikizumab and placebo -treated patients. T here are several ongoing and planned studies in 
UC with anti-IL-12/23 and anti -IL-23 specific mAbs, including :

Phase 2, ClinicalTrials.gov I dentifier: [STUDY_ID_REMOVED])
risankizumab (Phase 3, Study Registry ID: [REMOVED] and [STUDY_ID_REMOVED])
The therapeutic role of anti-IL-23 in Crohn’s disease was first established by [CONTACT_676469]-12/23p40 antagonists (briakinumab39and ustekinumab15). Ustekinumab, an IL-12/23p40 
antagonist, is approved for the treatment of moderate to severe Crohn’s disease (STELARA 
[LOCATION_002] Prescribing Information [USPI ]56, Summary  of Product Characteristics [SmPC]55).
While these programs demonstrated that blockade of both IL -12 and IL -23 is effective in treating 
Crohn’s disease, they could not determine the relative contributions specific to the blockade of 
each of the 2 cytokines. Two other anti-IL-23 mAbs, risankizumab (BI 655066)13,14,16and 
brazikumab (MEDI2070, AMG -139)49,50have reported Phase 2 results demonstrating the 
efficacy  of IL-23 blockade in s ubjects with moderate to severe Crohn’s disease. Further, Phase 3 
Crohn’s disease programs are underway  for risankizumab (Study Registry ID: [REMOVED]) and guselkumab (Phase 2b/3, Study Registry ID: [REMOVED]).
Given the simila rities in the biology  and treatment of Crohn ’s disease and UC, as well as the 
efficacy  and safety  of anti-IL-23 treatment demonstrated to date in both Crohn ’s disease and UC ,
there is strong rationale for the clinical development of guselkumab in UC.
2.1.2. Rationale for Combined Use of G uselkumab and Golimumab in 
Ulcerative Colitis
The purpose of this combination Phase 2a POC study  is to provide critical data that will inform 
potential future studies for combination use of an anti-IL-23intervention and ananti-TNFα
intervention in UC.
As described in Section 2.1, there remains a high unmet need in the IBD patient population with 
many  patients failing to achieve clinical response or clinical remission with current treatments. 
Addressing this unmet need may require targeting multiple pathogenic mechanisms through 
combination therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Combination therapy  is alread y well accepted in the clinical management 
of IBD; studies show that patients treated with a combination of infliximab and azathioprine
(AZA) are more likely to achieve corticosteroid- free remission than those treated with either 
monotherap y alone.7,38More recentl y, sponsors and independent investigators have initiated 
studies in IBD evaluating combinations of anti-TNFα agents with other biologic agen ts for 
periods up to 12 months.6,25,58Specifically , there is an ongoing open -label study  to evaluate the 
efficacy  and safet y of combination therapy  with vedolizumab, adalimumab, and methotrexate 
(MTX) for 26 weeks in subjects with Crohn's disease (ClinicalTria ls.gov Identifier: 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).58There are also case series describing treatment success esof combination 
therap y with vedolizumab plus ustekinumab or various anti-TNFα agents in patients with UC 
and Crohn’s disease for periods up to 12 months.6,19,25

In support of this combination therapy  approach, the sponsor has generated positive efficacy  data 
from anti-TNFα/anti -IL-[ADDRESS_914683] of monotherap y versus combination therap y on the human disease using a

2.2. Background
2.2.1. Nonclinical Development
Full nonclinical development programs were conducted with guselkumab and golimumab in 
support of global submissions and approvals forboth products. These included general 
toxicology  and toxicokinetic (TK) studies in support of first-in-human dosing, studies in support 
of Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical development, and developmental and reproductive toxicology 
studies. A comprehensive overview of the guselkumab and golimumab nonclinical data is 
presented in the guselkumab IB and the golimumab IB , respectivel y.
This section provides a summary  of the sponsor's assessment of how the overall nonclinical data 
support the safet y of the proposed dosing for guselkumab and golimumab inthis Phase 2a 
program in UC. Details regarding the proposed clinical dose regimen and dose rationale are 
described in Section 4.3of this protocol.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Guselkumab
Pharmacology
Primary  pharmacody namic (PD) studies determined guselkumab target binding interactions, 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_111050], in vitro mechanism of action, functional effects of neutralization, species 
cross -reactivity , and in vivo neutral ization of human IL-23 in mice. Guselkumab was shown to 
bind and neutralize IL-23, and to be pharmacologically  active in guinea pi[INVESTIGATOR_676418]-human 
primate. Guselkumab does not bind toor neutralize IL-23 in the rat or mouse. The cynomolgus 
monkey  was selected to be the pharmacologically  relevant toxicology  species for guselkumab, 
and the guinea pig was selected as the species to assess fertility. 
In accordance with the provisions of the International Conference on Harmon isation (ICH) S7A
guidance document22, safety  pharmacology  evaluations (cardiovascular [CV], respi [INVESTIGATOR_696] , central 
nervous system ) were incorporated into the design of the Good Laboratory  Practice (GLP)
repeat -dose toxicity  study in cynomolgus monkey s. Additionally , a CV safet y pharmacology  
study  was conducted in cy nomolgus monkey s.

The pharmac okinetic (PK)profile of guselkumab has been characterized in cynomolgus 
monkey s in (1) single -dose studies in which monkey s received a single intravenous (IV) and 
subcutaneous (SC)administration ; (2) a 5-week/24 -week study  in which monkey s received 
repea ted weekl y IV and/or SC doses of guselkumab (followed by a 3-month recovery );and(3) 
an enhanced prenatal and postnatal developmental (ePPND )study  in which pregnant females
were administered repeated weekl y SC doses of guselkumab. The PK profile was also
characterized in guinea pi[INVESTIGATOR_676419] a week. The 
results showed that guselkumab behaves as a t ypi[INVESTIGATOR_226798]-based therapeutic mAb. The TK results 
from all toxicology  studies conducted in guinea pi[INVESTIGATOR_676420] s demonstrated adequate and 
sustained drug exposure in the circulation to support the safet y evaluation in animal species. In 
addition, the TK results also demonstrated cross -placenta distribution of circulating guselkumab 
to the fetus and no measurable excreti on of guselkumab into milk. Only a small percentage 
(2.2%) of monkey s (2 of 90) were positive for anti-guselkumab antibodies and exhibited 
accelerated total systemic clearance of drug after IV administration or apparent total systemic 
clearance of drug after extravascular administration, and/or accelerated decrease in serum 
guselkumab concentrations. One of 24 (4.2%) infants from guselkumab-treated females in the 
ePPND study  was also found to be positive for anti -guselkumab antibodies.
Toxicology
The guselkumab toxicology  program evaluated the potential for sub- chronic and chronic toxicity , 
reproductive and developmental toxicity , tissue cross -reactivity  (TCR), serum compatibility , and 
hemoly tic potential using the cynomolgus monkey  and guinea pig, the only pharmacologicall y 
relevant species. During the conduct of the initial non-GLP and GLP TCR assay s, cytoplasmic 
binding of guselkumab to skeletal and cardiac myocytes was observed in both cynomolgus 
monkey  and human tissues. As a result of the unusual bindin g, a CV safety  pharmacology  study 
with guselkumab was conducted in cynomolgus monkey s to evaluate any potential adverse 
effects of guselkumab on cardiac function. In the cynomolgus monkey , potential for toxicity  was 
assessed in a GLP repeat -dose (5-week/24-week plus 3 -month drug -free period ) study  conducted 
in [ADDRESS_914684] Level (NOAEL) for guselkumab in cynomolgus monkey s was at least 
50mg/kg/week. In the ePPND study , the NOAEL for both maternal and developmental 
outcomes incynomolgus monkey s was also 50 mg/kg/week.  In guinea pig fertility  studies, the 
NOAEL  was 100 mg/kg (administered twice -weekl y). In all cases, doses were the highest 
administered in the respective test systems.

Pharmacology
In accordance with the provisions of the ICH S7A guidance document22, safet y pharmacology  
evaluations (CV, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] , central nervous system ) were incorporated into the design of the 
GLP repeat -dose toxicity  study in cynomolgus monkey s. No adverse effects were observed 
following single or repeated IV or SC dosing up to 50 mg/kg twice -weekly  or in 6-month old 
cynomolgus monkey  infants expos ed to golimumab during a GLP pre-and postnatal 
development study .
Pharmacokinetics
The cynomolgus monkey  was chosen as it was the only pharmacologically  relevant species for 
golimumab PK and toxicology  studies.
The PK profile of golimumab display ed dose-proportional PK with respect tomaximum 
observed concentration and area under the serum concentration versus time curve. Following SC 
administration, maximum observed concentration was observed 1 to 3 days after administration 
with an absolute bioavailability  of 77% or higher. Terminal elimination half -life ( t1/2)was similar 
following IV and SC administration and ranged from 0.39 to8.84 days. As with other IgG1s, 
golimumab can be transported through the placental barrier and expose the fetus when 
golimumab is administered to pregnant cynomolgus monkey s. An embry o-fetal development 
study  in cynomolgus monkey s demonstrated a substantial exposure to golimumab in both 
maternal and fetal circulation in response to twice -weekl y SC administration of golimumab at 
doses of 25 mg/kg or 50 mg/kg. By [CONTACT_676470] (gestation day 100) the 
maternal serum concentration ranged from 1 to 99 times that of fetal serum concentration. 
Development of antibodies to golimumab was frequently  observed in monkey s, especially  
following limited dosing at ≤10 mg/kg. Animals with shorter serum t1/2of golimumab produced 
antibodies to golimumab earlier than animals with longer t1/2values. It was expected that 
antibody  to golimumab induction was less likely  in human subjec ts because golimumab is a 
human IgG and thus should be less immunogenic to humans than to monkey s.
Toxicology
Nonclinical IV and SC toxicology  studies were conducted in cynomolgus monke ys up to 
6months in duration. In addition, an embry o-fetal development study  evaluating the maternal 
and fetal effects following maternal treatment during the period of organogenesis, a prenatal and 
postnatal development study  evaluating the maternal and neonatal effects following maternal 
treatment during the fetal and lactation periods, and a study  in young cynomolgus monkey s to 
provide safet y information to support use in pediatric subjects was conducted. Chronic toxicity  
and reproductive and developmental toxicity  of an anti-mouse TNFα mAb (cV1q) were also 
assessed to provide additional supportive data for the development of anti TNFα mAb therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. 
An in vitro human TCR study  was also conducted. No signs of toxicity  considered golimumab -
related were observed in any of these studies, except in [ADDRESS_914685] dose of 25 mg/kg IV that developed a disseminated histoplasmosis infection. This finding 
may have been due to a reactivation of a latent infection and was not unexpected based upon an

wasting and colon tissue collected to assess intestinal inflammation. In the highest dose 
combination of 500 µg anti-TNFα and 500µg anti-IL-23, no animals died and all animals 
showed improvement in weight and histological inflammation scores compared to diseased 
control -treated (phosphate buffered saline or isotype injected) animals. 
In summary , combination of anti-TNFα and anti-IL-23 antibodies administered to mice in a 
nonclinical model of colitis showed improvement in weight and histological inflammation scores 
in the absence of any acute toxicity . Neither guselkumab nor golimumab present ed an y apparent

2.2.2. Clinical Development
[IP_ADDRESS]. Current Status of Guselkumab Development
Guselkumab is a human mAb directed against the p19 subunit of IL-[ADDRESS_914687]  contributes to the 
chronic inflammation underly ing the pathophy siology  of many immune -mediated diseases,37,59
including psoriasis, PsA, and IBD. Susceptibility  to psoriasis, PsA, and IBD has been shown to 
be associated with genetic poly morphisms in IL -23/IL-23 receptor components.5,12,30,33,36
The clinical development program for guselkumab includes studies in patients with psoriasis 
(including plaque psoriasis, GPP, EP, PPP), PsA, and RA. Clinical data from these studies 
indicate that guselkumab administered IV or SC was generall y well tolerated. Additional 
information on these studies is provided in the guselkumab IB.
Todate, guselkumab has been approved inthe US, EU, Canada, and several other countries for 
the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis (TREMFYA USPI63, SmPC62).

To date, golimumab is approved for the treatment of moderatel y to severely  active UC in adult 
patients in over [ADDRESS_914689] 1 of the 
following indications in adults: RA, PsA, AS, andnr-Axial SpA. In addition, golimumab is also 
approved for use in children with pJ IA in over 30 countries inclu ding the EU.
The golimumab development program in adult UC consisted of 1 IV induction study  
(C0524T16)42, 1 SC induction study  (C0524T17)44, and 1 SC maintenance study  (C0524T18)45.
C0524T16 and C0524T17 were both 6-week induction studies with identical study  designs; the 
primary  differences were the dose regimens and routes of administration. More information on 
these studies can be found in the golimumab IB.
2.3. Benefit /Risk Assessment
Given the well- established scientific and clinical rationale for each monotherap y in IBD 
(Section 2.1), the high unmet medical need in UC, and the expected clinica l benefit of 
combination therapy , this Phase 2a POC clinical study  will evaluate the efficacy  and safety  of 
short -term combination therapy  with guselkumab and golimumab compared to guselkumab or 
golimumab alone in the treatment of patients with moderately  to severel y active UC. 
Importantly , all participants will have the benefit of receiving active treatment in this study  as 
there is no placebo treatment arm. Although guselkumab is an experimental treatment in IBD, 
clinical POC has been established for anti-IL-23 mAbs in both UC and Crohn’s disease .
14,15,46,47,49In a  recentl y reported Phase 2 study , mirikizumab (anti-IL-23 mAb) demonstrated 
efficacy  in the induction treatment for patients with moderately  to severel y active UC, as 
assessed b y multiple measures in cluding clinical response .46Overall AE frequencies were similar 
for mirikizumab and placebo-treated patients. 
The safet y profiles of guselkumab and golimumab are well characterized due to large clinical 
programs leadin g to their respective approvals (guselkumab – psoriasis and golimumab –RA, 
PsA, AS, nr-Axial SpA, and UC). Based on the available data and the safet y measures in this 
protocol, the overall benefit /risk assessment for using the selected dose regimens for 
combination therap y, guselkumab, and golimumab in this study is deemed acceptable based on 
the below considerations.
For guselkumab, the main risk, as described in Section 5 of the guselkumab IB, is infection. 
Other potential safety concerns, also described in greater detail in the guselkumab IB, are based 
on guselkumab being an immunomodulatory  mAb and include malignancy  and hypersensitivity . 
The approved dose regimen of guselkumab in psoriasis (100 mg SC at Week 0 and Week 4, and 
then every  8 w eeks [q8w] ) has been demonstrated to have a favorable safet y profile, and dose 
regimens as high as [ADDRESS_914690] favorable safety  in a 6-month

Approved , Date: 7 March 2019Phase 2 trial in RA.53Ahigher guselkumab dose regimen was selected for this study  compared 
to what is approved for psoriasis over the induction period (Week 0 to Week 12), because 
historically , doses during the induction period (up to 12 weeks) in IBD have been higher than 
those used in psoriasis for mAbs approved for both indications to achieve the desired efficacy  in 
IBD (STELARA USPI56, SmPC55; HUMI RA USPI21, SmPC20).Theproposed guselkumab dose 
for this protocol is the lowest of the 3 induction doses being evaluated in the ongoing 
guselkumab Phase2b/3 program in Crohn’s disease (200 mg, 600 mg, 1200 mgIV).Additional 
details about the dose selection rationale for guselkumab are provided in Section 4.3.1.
The anti-TNF class of agents has been extensively  studied and has a well-defined safety  profile. 
Known risks for anti-TNF agents such as golimumab include infections, including serious 
infec tions, tuberculosis (TB), and opportunistic infections. Other known risks include ,but are not 
limited to,lymphoma, leukemia, lupus -like syndrome , and demyelinating disorders (SIMPONI 
USPI52, SmPC51). The dose regimen of golimumab in this protocol is consistent with the 
currentl y approved dose, and is consistent with the dose regimens evaluated in the golimumab 
Phase 3 clinical development program in UC that established the efficacy  and safety  of 
golimumab in patients with moderatel y to severel y active UC. 
Given the risk of serious infections associated with the anti -TNF class and combination biologic 
use, the eligibility  criteria and screening assessments of this study  are designed to exclude 
subjects with chronic/active infections or a predisposition to infections. Measures to ensure the 
early detection of TB, such as chest radiograph and QuantiFERON®-TB test, are outlined in 
Section 8.2.[ADDRESS_914691] to the reported longer duration RA 
combination biolog ics studies (ie, up to 1 year),17,67,68the combination comparison phase of this 
study  in UC is of relatively  short duration (ie, approxima tely 12 weeks ), meaning that 
participants randomized to the combination therapy  intervention group will only receive 3 doses 
of guselkumab and 4 doses of golimumab that overlap. To reduce the risks associated with

4. STUDY DESIGN
4.1. Over allDesign
This is a Phase 2a, randomized, double -blind , active -controlled , parallel- group, multicenter ,
interventional POC clinical study designed to evaluate the efficacy  and safet y of combination 
therap y with guselkumab and golimumab in adults with moderately  to severel y active UC. The 
target population is men or women 18 to 65 years old with moderately  to severel y active UC, as 
defined b y a May o score of 6 to 12, inclusive, at basel ine,including an endoscopy  subscore ≥[ADDRESS_914696] failed or not tolerated conventional therap y with oral or IV corticosteroids 
or immunomodulators (6 -mercaptopurine [6- MP] or AZA). 
This study  will consist of [ADDRESS_914697] phases: a 12-week combination comparison phase followed 
by a 26-week monotherapy  phase. At W eek 0, atarget of 210 participants will be randomized in 
a 1:1:1 ratio to either combination therap y with guselkumab and golimumab, guselkumab 
monotherap y, or golimumab monother apy, stratified by [CONTACT_676479] (Y/N). Participants randomized to combination therap y will receive guselku mab 
monotherap y after Week 12. Participants randomized to a monotherapy group will continue on 
their originally  randomized monotherap y after Week 12. The combination therap y arm will 
employ  the same dose regimens of guselkumab and golimumab being used in the respective 
monotherap y intervention groups to facilitate scientifi c interpretation of the results. The 
following is a description of the 3 intervention groups:

Approved , Date: 7 March 2019Combination therapy: guselkumab 200 mg IV and golimumab 200 mg SC at Week 0; 
golimumab 100 mg SC at Weeks 2, 6, and 10; guselkumab 200 mg IV at Weeks 4 and 8 
followed b y guselkumab 100 mg SC q8w
Guselkumab monotherapy: guselkumab 200 mg IV at Weeks 0, 4, and 8followed by 
[CONTACT_676462] 100 mg SC q8w
Golimumab monotherapy: golimumab 200 mg SC injection at Week 0, followed by 
[CONTACT_676463] 100 mg at Week 2 and then golimumab 100 mg every  4 weeks ( q4w)
In addition, placebo administrations (IVor SC) will be given, as appropriate, to maintain the 
blind throughout the duration of the study . Refer to Study  Intervention (Section 6) for additional 
details.
Immunomodulators (6-MP, AZA, and MTX) must be discontinued for at least [ADDRESS_914698] begin tapering the daily  dose of corticosteroids at Week 6. All 
participants will be evaluated for clinical worsening of UC throughout the study . The use of 
concomitant and prohibited therapi[INVESTIGATOR_676422] 6.5. In general, doses of 
concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_676423] 38 (except formandatory oral 
corticosteroid tapering beginning at Week 6), andconcomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_676424]. Initiation of prohibited 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_676425].
Endoscopy  with central read is planned for screening/baseline, Week 12, and Week 38. 
Consenting participants will have an additional endoscop y at Week 4, which will also be 
assessed by a central reader . Efficacy , PK and PD parameters, biomarkers, and safet y will be 
assessed according to the Schedule of Activities (SoA) (Section 1.3). A pharmacogenomic blood 
sample will be collected from participants who consent to this component of the protocol (where 
local regulations permit). Participation in pharmacogenomic research is o ptional.
Overall participant duration will be upto 58weeks total (screening: up 
to 8 weeks; treatment 
duration: 38 weeks [12 weeks for the combination comparison phase; 26 weeks for the 
monotherap y phase]; safety  follow -up: approximately  [ADDRESS_914699] administration of 
study  intervention at Week 34).An interim analy sis is planned to inform future clinical 
development (see details in Section 9.5). Database locks (DBL s) are planned at Weeks [ADDRESS_914700] participant completes his or her final safety  follow -
up visit. 
An independent D MCwill be commissioned for this study , refer to Section 9.5.1 for more details 
on the DMC.

Approved , Date: 7 March [ZIP_CODE].2. Scientific Rationale for Study  Design
This type of parallel -group study  design is consistent with the design of other combination 
therap y studies .7,11,38,58The combination therapy arm will employ  the same dose regimens of 
guselkumab and golimumab that are being used in the respective monotherapy  treatment arms 
which will allow the contribution of each monotherapy to the combination to be assessed relative 
to each monotherap y alone. The target population (ie, men or women [ADDRESS_914701] failed or not 
tolerated conventional therap y) is considered appropriate given the study  interventions being 
evaluated. For example, the inclusion of patients who previously  failed TNF antagonists is not 
considered clinically  appropriate for this study  design since they could be randomized to the 
golimumab monotherap ytreatment arm. 
This study  will consist of [ADDRESS_914702] phases: a 12-week combination comparison phase followed 
by a  2 6-week monotherapy  phase. The duration of the combination comparison phase (ie, 
approximately 12 weeks ) is thought to provide sufficient time to evaluate the effect of 
combination therap y compared to monotherap y, while minimizing the potential risks associated 
with longer duration combination therapy . The 12-week duration of the combination comparison 
phase is important because if combination therapy  merely shifted late responders to an earlier 
response, but did not increase the total fraction of responders, then combination therap y would 
provide limited benefit to patients with UC. Moreover, Week 12 efficacy  endpoints are being 
used to evaluate other anti-IL-23 mAb s.1,46Participants randomized to a monotherap y group will 
continue inthe monotherap y phase based on their original randomized treatment group , with 
participants in the combination therap y arm receiving guselkumab monotherapy after Week 12. 
The duration of 26 weeks for the monotherapy  phase is thought to provide sufficient time to 
evaluate response in all 3 intervention groups .
4.2.1. Blinding, Control, Study Phase/Periods, Intervention Groups
Two monotherap y control swill be used to determine the sensitivity  of the clinical endpoints in 
this study .Randomization will be used to minimize bias in the assignment of participants to 
intervention groups, to increase the likelihood that known and unknown participant attributes 
(eg,demographic and baseline characteristics) are evenl y balanced across intervention groups, 
and to enhance thevalidity  of statistical comparisons across intervention groups. Blinded 
intervention will be used to reduce potential bias during data collection and evaluation of clinical 
endpoints.
4.2.2. DNA andBiomarker Collection
Biomarker samples will be collected to evaluate the cellular and molecular mechanism of action 
of guselkumab and golimumab , or help to explain interindividual variability  in clinical outcomes, 
or may help to identify population subgroups that respond differently  to either interve ntion. 
Serum , whole blood, and fecal samples will be collected from all participants to assess PD 
markers associated with the response to guselkumab and golimumab . Mucosal biopsies will also 
be obtained from all participants pre-treatment during screening and post-treatment at Weeks 12 
and 38to assess cellular and molecular changes within the intestinal mucosal tissue. The goal of 
the biomarker analy ses is to further defin e the mechanism of action of guselkumab and

Approved , Date: 7 March 2019golimumab combination treatment or monoth erapy with either agent in UC, and to aid in 
evaluating the intervention- clinical response relationship. 
Two optional sub -studies are planned:
Optional Week 4 endoscopy and biopsy sub-study: Only  those participants who consent 
to participate in the option alsub-study  will undergo Week 4 endoscopy  assessment and
biopsy collection . Exploratory  analyses of intestinal mucosal tissue obtained by [CONTACT_676480] 4 will be performed to delineate the mechanisms of action of guselkumab and/or
golimumab by [CONTACT_9851] a sequence of molecular and cellular effects beginning at an 
early time point. Whole blood (PBMCs) will also be collected. In addition, data collected at 
Week 4 will be explored for correlation with clinical efficacy  observations at later time 
points.
Optional pharmacogenomic sub-study : It is recognized that genetic variation can be an 
important contributory  factor to interindividual differences in intervention distribution and 
response and can also serve as a marker for disease susceptibility  and prognosis. 
Pharmacogenomic research may help to explain interindividual variability  in clinical 
outcomes, identify  markers associated with disease susceptibility  and prognosis, and may 
help to identify  population subgroups that respond di fferently  to an intervention. The goal of 
the pharmacogenomic component is to collect deox yribonucleic acid ( DNA )to allow for the 
identification of genetic factors that may influence the PK, PD, efficacy , safety , or 
tolerability  of guselkumab and/orgolim umab and to identify  genetic factors associated with 
UC or the response to guselkumab and/or golimumab treatment. 
4.2.3. Patient -Reported Outcomes on Health -Related Quality  of Life
Patient- reported outcome (PRO) evaluations (ie, IBDQ , PROMI S-29, PRO MIS Fatigue 7 -item 
Short Form , and PGIC of Severit y of UC) willbe used to assess the benefits of guselkumab and 
golimumab treatment on disease -specific and general HRQOL . Patient- reported outcomes will 
only be collected in countries where translations of the evaluatio ns are available. See Section 8.[ADDRESS_914703] their decision to continue 
participation. They  will b e told that their consent to participate in the study  is voluntary  and may  be 
withdrawn at any time with no reason given and without penalt y or loss of benefits to which they 
would otherwise be entitled. Only participants who are fully able to understand the risks, benefits, 
and potential AEs of the study , and provide their consent voluntaril y will be enrolled.

Approved , Date: 7 March 2019The total blood volume to be collecte d from each participant in this study  (maximum of 
approximately 350mL over approximately  58weeks) is far less than the American Red Cross 
standard limit for whole blood donation (approximately  475 mL q8w) and is, therefore, 
considered an acceptable amount of blood to be collected over this time. For more details 
regarding blood collection, see Blood Sample Collection in Section 8.
4.3. Justification for Dose
4.3.1. Guselkumab
The planned guselkumab dose is [ADDRESS_914704] been higher 
than those in psoriasis for mAbs approved for both indications (STEL ARA USPI56, SmPC55; 
HUMI RA USPI21, SmPC20).
Regarding the safet y of this higher IV guselkumab dose, single doses of guselkumab as high as 
10 mg/kg, with the highest single dose tested being [ADDRESS_914705] been previously  studied in a 
Phase 1 plaque psoriasis study  in a limited number of participants. Additionally , guselkumab IV 
doses of up to 50 mg/kg weekl y for 5 weeks and guselkumab SC doses of up to 50 mg/kg weekl y 
for 24 weeks were well tolerated in cynomolgus monkey s,and did not result in any clinical or 
anatomic findings (Section [IP_ADDRESS] ). These data suggest an acceptable exposure margin between 
the predicted guselkumab exposures at the pr oposed dose regimen compared to those observed in 
toxicology  studies; the estimated safety  margin is approximately  19-to 26-fold for the 200 mg 
IV dosing.
This guselkumab dose regimen was further chosen to align with the dose regimens being tested 
in the guselkumab Phase 2b/3 Crohn’s disease program while minimizing the potential safety 
risk in the combination setting (see Section 4.3.3 ). This is deemed to be a reasonable selection 
given the shared biology  and the similar response to treatments between Crohn’s disease and 
UC. S pecifically, this guselkumab dose regimen corresponds to the lowest dose regimen planned 
to be evaluated in the dose-ranging portion of the Phase 2b/3 Crohn’s disease program. Dose 
selection for the latter program was based on several considerations, including dose-response 
data from studies of guselkumab in plaque psoriasis, and published information on risankizumab 
(another anti-IL-23 mAb) in plaque psoriasis and Crohn’s disease, and on the relative dosing 
requirements for anti-IL-23 mAbs in plaque psoriasis v ersus Crohn’s disease. Specifically , in 
Crohn’s disease, the 200 mg IV induction dose of risankizumab achieved clinical response and 
remission rates of 32% and 17% respectivel y at Week 8, approximating rates observed with 
STEL ARA at the approved dose in comparable patient populations.14A maintenance regimen of 
100 mg SC q8W anchored at the approved psoriasis dose will be studied following the 200 mg 
IV induction therapy . The posology  ofother biologics in Crohn’s disease suggests that once the

Approved , Date: 7 March 2019disease inflammatory  burden is reduced, the drug exposures required to maintain efficacy  may  be 
lower than the exposures attained with initial induction doses. 
4.3.2. Golimumab
The planned golimumab dose is the approved dose forUC (SIMPONI USPI52, SmPC51). It is the 
highest approved golimumab dose across indication s and the safety profile is well established : 
[ADDRESS_914706] s typi[INVESTIGATOR_676426], which has large capacit y. Given the acceptable nonclinical and 
clinical safet y profiles for guselkumab and golimumab and the short duration inthecombination
comparison phase (approximately  12 weeks), potential safety  risk in the combination setting is 
considered to be manageable with careful monitoring and early intervention (including 
pre-defined stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_676427] 2.3and Section 7).
4.4. End of Study  Definition
The study  is consi dered completed when the last participant completes the last scheduled study  
assessment shown in the SoA (Section 1.3) and appropriate follow -up has been completed . The 
final data from the study  site will be sent to the sponsor (or designee) after completion of the 
final participant assessment at that study  site, in the time frame specified in the Clinical Trial 
Agreement.

The participant identification and enrollment log will be treated as confidential and will be filed 
by [CONTACT_23854]. To ensure participant confidentiality , no copy  will be made. 
All reports and communications relating to the study  will identify  participants by [CONTACT_90802] . In cases where the participant is not 
randomized into the study , the date seen and age at initial informed consent will be used.
Completion of screening and randomization procedures within the specified 8-week window is 
required. If any delay  leads to the expi[INVESTIGATOR_356310]-specific assessments (eg, TB, chest 
radiograph, endoscop y), the participant will be considered a screen failure because he/she will 
not meet eligibility  criteria and the expi[INVESTIGATOR_356311] (along with the non-time-specific 
laboratory  tests) will have to be repeated on rescreening.
Retesting
Retesting of abnormal laboratory  values that may lead to exclusion will be allowed once. 
Retesting can occur at an unscheduled visit during the screening phase, as long as this is done 
within the specified screening window of 8 weeks.
Rescreening
Individuals who do not meet the criteria for participation in this study  (screen failure) may be 
rescreened 1 time. Rescreened participants should be assigned a new participant number, 
undergo the informed consent process, and then start a new screening phase.

For the baseline (W0) visit, the IV study intervention should be administered first. The SC study  
intervention should be administered approximately  [ADDRESS_914733] be captured in the source documents and the electronic 
case report form (e CRF ).
Guselkumab and golimumab and the corresponding placebo for each intervention will be 
manufactured and provided under the responsibility  of the sponsor .Refer to the respective IBs
for a list of excipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. Detailed instructions on the administration of study  intervention will be 
provided in the site Investigational Product Procedures Manual (IPPM) and Investigation 
Product Preparation I nstructions (I PPI).
Guselkumab
Guselkumab will be supplied as a 100 mg/mL sterile liquid in a single dose prefilled syringe 
(PFS)assembled in an UltraSafe Plus™ Passive Needle Guard (PFS -U). Placebo for guselkumab 
will be supplied as a 1mL sterile liquid in a single dose PFS assembled in aPFS-U. The single 
dose PFS -U will support both I V preparations and SC administrations.
Golimumab
Golimumab for SC injection will be supplied as a 100 mg/mL sterile liquid in a single -use PFS. 
Placebo for golimumab for SC injection will be supplied as a 1 mL sterile liquid in a single -use 
PFS. 
6.2. Preparation/Handling/Storage/A ccountability
Guselkumab, placebo for guselkumab, golimumab, and placebo for golimumab will be supplied 
to the study  sites. All study  interventions must be stored according to the labeled storage 
condition, 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F) ,and protected from exposure to light. Do not freeze the 
study  interventions. The products are designed for single- use only . 
Guselkumab should be clear and colorless to light yellow solution that may contain small 
translucent particles. Do not use guselkumab if the liquid is cloudy  or discolored, or has large

use golimumab if the solution is discolored or cloud y, or if foreign particles are present. 
Protection from light is not required during the preparation and administration of the study  
intervention material ; avoid direct exposure to sunlight . Aseptic procedures must be used during 
the preparation and administration of t he study  intervention material.
Refer to thesite IPPM and IPPI [INVESTIGATOR_363046], 
handling, and storage.
6.2.1. Accountability
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all study  intervention received at the site is 
inventoried and accounted for throughout the study .The study  intervention administered to the 
participant must be documented on the intervention accountability  form. All study  intervention 
will be stored and disposed of according to the sponsor's instructions. 
Study  intervention must be handled in strict accordance with the protocol and the container label, 
and must be stored at the study  site in a limited -access area or in a locked cabinet under 
appropriate environmental conditions. Unused study  intervention must be available for 
verification by [CONTACT_456]'s study  site monitor during on -site monitoring visits. The return to the 
sponsor of unused study  intervention will be documented on the intervention return form. When 
the study  site is an authorized destruction unit and study  intervention supplies are destroy ed on-
site, this must also be documented on the intervention return form .
Potentially  hazardous materials such as used ampules, needles, syringes ,and vials containing 
hazardous liquids should be disposed of immediately  in a safe manner and therefore will not be 
retained for intervention accountability  purposes. 
Study  intervention should be dispensed under the supervision of the investigator or a qualified 
member of the study -site personnel, or by  a ho spi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/clinic pharmacist. Study  intervention will be 
supplied only to participants participating in the study . Returned study  intervention must not be 
dispensed again, even to the same participant. Study  intervention may not be relabeled or 
reassigned for use by [CONTACT_48780]. The investigator agrees neither to dispense the study  
intervention from, nor store it at, any site other than the study sites agreed upon with the sponsor.
6.3. Measures to Minimize Bias: Randomization and Blinding
Randomization will be used to minimize bias in the assignment of participants to treatment 
groups, to increase the likelihood that known and unknown participant attributes (eg, 
demogr aphic and baseline characteristics) are evenly  balanced across treatment groups, and to 
enhance the validity  of statistical comparisons across treatment groups. Blinded treatment will be 
used to reduce potential bias during data collection and evaluation o f clinical endpoints.
Intervention Allocation
Central randomization will be implemented in this study . Participants will be randomly  assigned 
to 1 of 3 intervention groups (1:1:1 ratio), based on a computer -generated randomization

Approved , Date: 7 March 2019schedule prepared before the studies by [CONTACT_43754]. The 
randomization will be balanced by [CONTACT_676486] (Y/N). The interactive web response system 
(IWRS)will assign a unique treatment code, which will dictate the treatment assignment and 
matching study  intervention kit(s) for the participant. The requestor must use his or her own user 
identification and personal identification number when contact[CONTACT_23790], and will then be 
given the relevant participant details to uniquely  identify  the participant.
Blinding
To maintain the study  blind, the study  intervention container will have a label containing the 
study  name , study  intervention number, and reference number. The study  intervention number 
will be entered in the eCRF when the study  intervention is dispensed. Each active study 
intervention and its matching placebo will be identical in appearance .
The investigator will not be provided with randomization codes. The codes will be maintained 
within the IWRS, which has the functionality  to allow the investigator to break the blind for an 
individual participant .
Data that may potentially  unblind the treatment assignment (eg, study  intervention serum 
concentrations, antibodies to study  intervention ) will be handled with special care to ensure that 
the integrit y of the blind is maintained and the potential for bias is minimized. This can include 
making special provisions, such as segregating the data in question from view by [CONTACT_4520], clinical team, or others as appropriate until the study  unblinding.
The post-baseline results of CRP and fecal calprotectin tests performed by [CONTACT_676487]. If astudy  site requests these data, it will be provided to them 
after the final safety  analy ses have been completed.
Treatment assignment b linding will be maintained for study sites, site monitors, and participants
until the final safet y DBL and anal yses are completed . 
In this study , the full sponsor unblinding will occur after the Week [ADDRESS_914734] 30% to 60% of randomized participants have either 
completed the Week [ADDRESS_914735] terminated study  participation before Week 12. At the time 
of thisinterim analy sis, alimited number of sponsor personnel (except for site monitors, who 
have interactions with the investigative sites) will become unblinded to only those first 30% to 
60% of randomized participants . The purpose and analytical details for this interim analy sis are 
provided inSection 9.5. After all [ADDRESS_914736] termin ated study  participation before Week 12, the Week 12 DBL will 
occur and the data for participants will be unblinded and released for analysis to a limited 
number of sponsor personnel (except for site monitors, who have interactions with the 
investigative sites). A subsequent Week [ADDRESS_914737] terminated study  participant before 
Week 38. Following the Week 38 DBL, t he treatment assignment information will be unblinded 
to the sponsor for all participants and released to the sponsor for analysis. The final safet y DBL

Approved , Date: [ADDRESS_914738] access to the unblinded participant -level data 
at the time of each DBL will be documented before unblinding. 
Under normal circumstances, the investigator blind should not be broken unless specific 
emergency  treatment/course of action would be dictated by [CONTACT_676488]. In such cases, the investigator may in an emergency  determine the identity  of the 
treatment via theIWRS. It is recomm ended that the investigator contact [CONTACT_57809], if possible, to discuss the particular situation before breaking the blind. Telephone 
contact [CONTACT_97500] [ADDRESS_914739] be 
retained with the participant's source documents in a secure manner.
Additionally , a given participant’s treatment assignment may be unblinded to the sponsor, the 
Independent Ethics Committee/I nstitutional Review Board (IEC/IRB), and site personnel to 
fulfill regulatory  reporting requirements for suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions 
(S[LOCATION_003]Rs). If a participant is unblinded by [CONTACT_779], the information must be entered in the 
appropriate section of the eCRF and in the participant's source docu ments. 
Participants who have had their treatment assignment unblinded by [CONTACT_676489], but should complete evaluations specified in the 
appropriate S oA(Section 1.3) for participants who discontinue study  intervention .
A separate code break procedure will be available for use by  J&J Global Medical Safet y group to 
allow for unblinding of individual participants to comply  with specific requests from regulatory  
or health authorities.
6.4. Study Intervention Compliance
When study  intervention is administered as an IV infusion or SC injection by [CONTACT_3436], the
details of each administration will be recorded in the eCRF. For IV infusions, thiswill include 
date and start and stop times of the IV infusion and volume infused; for SC injections, this will 
include date and time of SC injection. Additional details may be provided in the site IPPMand 
IPPI [INVESTIGATOR_676431] y.
Compliance with the treatment schedule is strongl y encouraged. Throughout the study , the 
investigator or designated study  research personnel will be responsible for providing additional 
instruction to re -educate any  participant who is not compliant with taking study  intervention.

Immunomodulat ors (6-MP, AZA, and MTX) must be discontinued [ADDRESS_914741] dose 
of study  intervention, as defined in the Inclusion Criteria (Section 5.1). Participants who are 
receiving oral 5-ASA compounds or oral corticosteroids for the treatment of UC at baseline 
should maintain a stable dose for the specified period before baseline, as defined in the Inclusion 
Criteria (Section 5.1). In general, participants who are receiving these medications for UC at 
baseline (ie,Week 0) should maintain a stable dose through Week 38, with the exception of oral 
corticosteroids. Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_676432] 0 if 
investigator judgment requires it because of toxicity  or other medical necessit y; even if the 
toxicity  resolves, the therapy  should not be restarted. Oral corticosteroids must be maintained at 
baseline doses through Week 6, and all participants must begin tapering oral corticosteroids at 
Week 6, unless medically not feasible (see further details in Section [IP_ADDRESS] ,Oral Corticosteroids 
Tapering).
Enrolled participants should not initiate any of the following concomitant UC-specific medical 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]:
Oral or rectal 5- ASA compounds.
Oral, parenteral, or rectal corticosteroids, including budesonide and beclomethasone 
dipropi[INVESTIGATOR_16847].
Antibiotics as a primary  treatment for UC. 
Total parenteral nutrition or enteral nutrition as a treatment for UC.
If the above medical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_676433] y as assessed by [CONTACT_093], participants should continue to attend all study  visits 
and have all assessments. While this does not represent a deviation from the study  protocol and 
the participants may remain on their assigned therapy , it may be considered a treatment failure. 
Treatment f ailures due to UC medication changes willbe defined in the SAP.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Oral Corticosteroids Tapering
At Week 6, all participants who were taking oral corticosteroids at Week [ADDRESS_914742] begin tapering 
corticosteroids. This tapering is mandatory , unless not medically  feasible, and should follow the

activity  while tapering corticosteroids, further dose decreases may be suspended, and/or their 
oral corticosteroid dose may be temporarily  increased if deemed necessary  by [CONTACT_093]. 
The oral corticosteroid dose, however, may not be increased above the Week 0 dose unless due 
to medical necessity. For participants whose corticosteroid taper is interrupted, investigators are 
encouraged to resume tapering within 4 weeks. Tapering may exceed this schedule only if 
warranted b y medical necessity (eg, participant experiencing corticosteroid -related side effects).

Overview
The SoA (Section 1.3)summarizes the frequency and timing of efficacy , PK, immunogenicity, 
biomarker (PD), pharmacogenomic, medical resource utilization, and safet y measurements 
applicable to this study .
All visit-specific PRO assessments should be conducted /completed before any tests, procedures, 
or other consultations to prevent influencing participant perceptions.
Blood collections for PK and PD assessments should bekept as close to the specified time as 
possible. Other measurements may be done earlier than specified time points if needed. Actual 
dates and times of assessments will be recorded in the source documentation.  
For women of childbearing potential only, additional serum or urine pregnancy  tests may be 
performed, as determined necessary  by [CONTACT_31837], to 
establish the absence of pregnancy  at any  time during the participation in the study .
Medical resource utilization data will be collected. Refer to Section 8.9, Medical Resource 
Utilization for details.
At their last study  visit, each study  participant will be invited to complete an IEC/IRB approved 
Experience Survey , to share his/her experience as a volunteer in this study . The responses will be 
collected b y an external party and provided anony mously  to the sponsor .
Screening Phase
After written informed consent has been obtained and within 8weeks before randomization, all 
screening evaluations (eg, laboratory  test results, clinical data, and concomitant medication data) 
that establish participant eligibility  will be performed by  [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_676435]. Participants who meet all of the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria can be 
enrolled in the study . Every  effort should be made to adhere to the SoA (Section 1.3) for each 
participant. The collection of AEs will start at the time informed consent is obtained. 
Diaries will be provided to each participant to record concomitant medications, stool production, 
and epi[INVESTIGATOR_676436]. A Mayo diary  will be completed from recall at screening and 
will be used to calculate a partial May o score (Section 8.1.1 ) to assess the participant’s eligibility 
for further screening and to train the participant on the use of the diary . Participants with a partial 
Mayo score ≥3 can proceed with endoscop y.Participants will be instructed to complete a daily 
Mayo diary for 7days immediately  before each visit and bring them to every  visit for data

by [CONTACT_676494].
Participants must undergo testing for TB (Section 8.2.12 ) and their medical history  assessment 
must include specific questions about a history  of TB or known occupational or other personal 
exposure to individuals with active TB. The participant should be asked about past testing for 
TB, including chest radiograph results and responses to tuberculin skin or other TB testing. A 
participant’s eligibility  according to TB screening criteria is descr ibed in Section 5.1, Inclusion 
Criterion 11.
Blood Sample Collection
Blood samples should be collected at the visits indicated in the SoA (Section 1.3). The date and 
time of collection will be recorded. When blood samples are to be collected for safety, PK,

(Section 1.3).
8.1.1. Mayo Score and Partial May o Score
The Mayo score (see Appendix 8[Section 10.8]) was developed from the criteria of Truelove 
and Witts64for mild, moderate, and severe UC and from the criteria of Baron et al3for grading 
endoscopic appearance. The May o score is calculated as the sum of 4 subscores (stool freq uency , 
rectal bleeding, physician's global assessment , and endoscop y findings ) each with a score range 
of 0 (normal activity ) to 3 (severe activity ) and a total score range of 0 to 12 points. A score of 3 
to 5 points indicates mildly  active disease, a score of 6 to 10 points indicates moderatel y active 
disease, and a score of 11 to 12 points indicat es severe ly active disease . The endoscopic findings 
will be assessed by [CONTACT_093] (ie, local endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_541]) during the endoscopy  procedure and 
by [CONTACT_676495] a video of the endoscopy . Participant eligibility  at baseline will 
be based on the final reported endoscopic subscore as determined b y the following process:
If the local endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_676437], the agreed 
score will be the final reported endoscopic subscore.  
If there is a discrepancy  between the local endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_676438], the 
video endoscop y will be submitted to a second central reader (designated for adjudicatio n). 
The median score of the 3 completed reads (ie, local read, central read 1, and central read 2 
designated for adjudication) will be the final reported endoscopic subscore.
Specific details will be provided in the imaging charter .
Mayo scores are calculated using the following: 
1.The stool frequency  and rectal bleeding data from the most recent consecutive 3-day period 
within the 1 week before the visit. The average of the 3-day period will be used to calculate 
the stool frequency  and RBSs for the visit. Days on which the following conditions are met 
should be excluded from the calculation:
a.The day on which medications for constipation, diarrhea, or irregul arity were taken.  
(For participants maintained on a stable dose of bulking or stool -softening agents 
throughout the study , the days on which these agents are taken should not be excluded 
from consideration in calculating the May o score.)
b.The day(s) of a procedure or preparation for a procedure (eg, enemas, other laxatives, a 
clear l iquid diet) that would affect bowel frequency  and/or blood content of the stool.
c.The 48 hours after the use of antimotility  agents (ie, diphenox ylate hydrochloride with 
atropi[INVESTIGATOR_52339], loperamide, or other opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]).
d.The 48 hours immediately  following a c olonoscopy .
2.The phy sician’s global assessment.
3.The results of a sigmoidoscopy  or colonoscopy .
The partial Mayo score is the May o score without the endoscopy  subscore and ranges from 0 to 
9 points.

The UCEIS is an index that provides an overall assessment of endoscopic severit y of UC, based 
on mucosal vascular pattern, bleeding, and ulceration.61The score ranges from [ADDRESS_914751] ive Protein
C-reactive protein has been demonstrated to be useful as a marker of inflammation in subjects 
with IBD. In subjects with UC, elevated CRP has been associated with severe clinical activity , an 
elevated sedimentation rate, and active disease as detected by [CONTACT_19069] .54,66Serum samples 
for the measurement of CRP will be collected from all participants at visits indicated inthe SoA
(Section 1.3). C-reactive protein will be assay ed using a validated, high sensitivity  CRP assay .
8.1.4. Fecal Calprotectin
Fecal calprotectin has been demonstrated to be a sensitive and specific marker in identify ing 
intestinal inflammation and response to treatment in participants with IBD, especially  in UC.2
Stool samples for calprotectin concentrations will be collected from all participants at visits as 
indicated in the SoA (Section 1.3).
Assay s for fecal calprotectin concentration will be performed by [CONTACT_676496] a 
validated method. Additional tests may also be performed on the stool samples for additional 
markers that are related to intestinal inflammation and treatment response such as the 
microbiome.
8.1.5. Inflammat ory Bowel Disease Questionnair e
The IBDQ23is a validated, 32-item, self-reported questionnaire for participants with IBD that 
will be used to evaluate the disease -specific HRQOL across 4 dimensional scores: bowel
symptoms (loose stools, abdominal pain), systemic functions (fatigue, altered sleep patter n), 
social function (work attendance, need to cancel social events), and emotional function (anger, 
depressi on, irritability ). Scores range from 32 to 224, with higher scores indicating better 
outcomes.
8.1.6. PROMIS -29
The PROMIS -29is a validated general health profile instrument that is not disease -specific. It is 
a collection of short forms containing 4 items for each of 7 domains (depression, anxiety, 
physical function, pain interference, fatigue, sleep disturbance, and ability t o participate in social 
roles and activities). PROMI S-[ADDRESS_914752] been calculated for each domain on the PROMI S

8.1.7. PROMIS Fatigue 7-items Short Form
The PROMIS Fatigue Short Form 7a contains 7 items evaluating fatigue -related s ymptoms (ie, 
tiredness, exhaustion, mental tiredness , and lack of energy ) and associated impacts on daily 
activities (ie, activity  limitations related to work, self -care, and exercise). PROMI S Fatigue Short 
Form 7a has a recall period of past 7days. Compared to the fatigue scale of PROMI S-29, 
PROMI S Fatigue Short Form 7a provides a dditional information to evaluate severit y of fatigue.
8.1.8. Bristol Stool Form Scale
The BSFS is amedical aid to classify  the form (or consistency ) of human feces into 
7categories.27It has been used as a research tool to evaluate the effectiveness of treatments for 
various diseases of the bowel (eg, irritable bowel syndrome ). Participants will complete the 
BSFS as a daily  diary  entry from Week 0 through Week 12 .
8.1.9. Patient’s Global Impression of Change (PGIC) of Severity of 
Ulcerative Colitis
Participant s’ perceived change (improvement or deterioration) in the severity  of their UC will be 
assessed using the PGIC . Participants will rate how their UChas changed since the beginning of 
the study  using a 7-point scale ranging from “a lot better now” to “a lot worse now” with a 
neutral center point (“neither better nor worse”).

8.2.6. Columbia- Suic ide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS)
The C-SSRS defines 5 subty pes of suicidal ideation and 4possible suicidal behaviors, as well as 
non-suicidal self-injurious behavior and completed suicide . It willbe used as a screening tool to 
prospectivel y evaluate suicidal ideation and behavior in this study , as part of a comprehensive 
evaluation of safet y. The C-SSRS is aninvestig ator-administered questionnaire.32,40Two 
versions of it will be used in this study : the ‘Baseline/Screening’ version of the C-SSRS will be 
conducted during the screening visit and the ‘Since Last Visit’ version of the C-SSRS will be 
completed at all other visits through the end of the study .
The investigator or trained study -site personnel will interview the participant and complete the 
C-SSRS. The C-SSRS will be provided in the local languages in accordance with local 
guidelines.
At screening, the C-SSRS will be the first assessment performed after signing informed consent ,
before any other study  procedure. At all subsequent visits ,the C-SSRS will be performed

Approved , Date: [ADDRESS_914756]. 
At the conclusion of each assessment, the trained personnel administering the C-SSRS will 
determine the level of suicidal ideation or behavior, if any. They  will then determine the next 
course of action if any level of suicidal ideation or behavior is reported. The participant should 
not be releas ed from the site until the C-SSRS has been reviewed by [CONTACT_356338]’s risk has been assessed and follow- up determined, as appropriate.
At screening (within the last 6 months) and Week 0, participants with a C-SSRS rating of 
SuicidalIdeation with Intention to Act (“Ideation level 4”), Suicidal Ideation with Specific Plan 
and Intent (“Ideation level 5”), or suicidal behavior (actual suicide attempt, interrupted suicide 
attempt, aborted suicide attempt, or preparatory  behaviors for mak ing a suicide attempt), must be 
determined to not be at risk by [CONTACT_356327] a  m ental health 
professional (eg, psychiatrist, psychologist, or appropriatel y trained social worker or nurse) in 
order to be randomized .
Participant s with C-SSRS ratings of Wish to be Dead (“Ideation level 1”), Non-Specific Active 
Suicidal Thoughts (“Ideation level 2”), Active Suicidal Ideation with Any Methods (Not Plan) 
without Intent to Act (“Ideation level 3”) or non-suicidal self-injurious behavior must be 
determined not to be at risk by [CONTACT_676499] .Any 
questions regarding eligibility  of such participants should be discussed with the medical monitor 
or designee.
For each assessment after Week 0, the fol lowing actions should be taken, if applicable:
No suicidal ideation or behaviors (including self-injurious behavior without suicidal intent): 
No further action is needed.
Suicidal ideation levels 1-3 or non-suicidal self-injurious behavior: Participant risk is 
assessed b y the investigator.
Suicidal ideation levels 4 or 5 or any  suicidal behavior: Participant risk assessed and referral 
to a mental health professional.
Interruption or the discontinuation of study  treatment should be considered for any partici pant 
who reports Suicidal Ideation with Intention to Act (“Ideation level 4”), Suicidal Ideation with 
Specific Plan and Intent (“Ideation level 5”), or suicidal behavior (actual suicide attempt, 
interrupted suicide attempt, aborted suicide attempt, or preparatory  behaviors for making a 
suicide attempt) on a post-baseline C-SSRS assessment and who is deemed to be at risk by [CONTACT_356340] a  m ental health professional. If a  p articipant can be 
adequatel y treated with psychotherapy  and/or pharmacotherap y then the participant, at the 
discretion of the investigator, may be continued with treatment if agreed to by [CONTACT_356341]. Discussion of such participants with the medical monitor or designee is 
required (see Section 7.1, Discontinuation of Study  Intervention).

8.2.7. Concomitant Medication Review
Concomitant medications will be reviewed at each visit.
8.2.8. Injection- Site Reactions
An injection -site reacti on is any adverse reaction at aSC study  intervention injection site. 
Injection sites will be evaluated for reactions and any injection -site reaction will be recorded as 
an AE.
8.2.9. Hypersensitivity Reaction s
Before any SC injection or IV infusion of study  intervention , appropriately  trained personnel and 
medications must be available to treat hypersensitivity reactions, including anaph ylaxis. All 
participants must be observed carefull y for signs and symptoms of ahypersensitivity  reaction 
(eg, urticaria, pruritis, angioedema, wheezing, d yspnea, or hypotension). 
In the case of anaph ylaxis, injectable epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] (intramuscular) , respi[INVESTIGATOR_356307], and 
other proper resuscitative measures are essential and must be available at the study  site where the 
injections or infusions are being administered.
Participants who experience serious adverse reactions related to an injection or infusion must
strongl y be considered to bediscontinued from further study  intervention administrations.
Participants who experience reactions following an injection or infusion that result in 
bronchospasm with wheezing and/or dyspnea that requires ventilatory  support, or symptomatic 
hypotension with a decrease in systolic blood pressure greater than 40 mmHg or blood pressure 
<90/[ADDRESS_914757] be discontinued from additional study  intervention administration (see 
Section 7).
Participants who experience reactio ns suggestive of serum sickness (resulting in symptoms such 
as myalgia and/or arthralgia with fever and/or rash that are not representative of signs and 
symptoms of other recognized clinical syndromes) occurring [ADDRESS_914758] be discontinued from further study  intervention administration. Note 
that these signs and symptoms may be accompanied by [CONTACT_41024], facial, 
hand, or lip edema, d ysphagia, urticaria, sore throat, and/or headache.
8.2.10. Adverse Events Temporally Associated With Infusion
Any AE (except laboratory  abnormalities) that occurs during or within 1 hour after the IV 
infusion of study  interventio n will be carefully evaluated. Minor infusion- related AEs may be 
managed by [CONTACT_247915]/or treating with antihistamines and/or

result in a serious adverse event (SAE), the infusion may  be restarted with caution.
8.2.11. Infect ions
Study  intervention should not be administered toa participant with a clinicall y significant , active 
infection. Investigators are required to evaluate participant s for any signs or symptoms of 
infection at scheduled visits (see SoA, Section 1.3). Ifa participant develops a serious infection, 
including but not limited to sepsis or pneumonia, discontinuation of study  intervention must be 
strongl y considered.
8.2.12. Tuberculosis Evaluations
[IP_ADDRESS]. Initial Tuberculosis Evaluation
Participants must undergo testing for TB and their medical history  assessment must include 
specific questions about a history  of TB or known occupational or other personal exposu re to 
individuals with active TB. The participant should be asked about past testing for TB, including 
chest radiograph results and responses to tuberculin skin or other TB testing. Investigators have 
the option to use both the QuantiFERON®-TBtest and thetuberculin skin test (refer to 
Appendix 3 [Section 10.3])to screen for latent TB if they believe, based on their judgment, that 
the use of both tests is clinically  indicated in order to evaluate a participant who has high risk of 
having latent TB. If either the QuantiFERON®-TB test or the tuberculin skin test is positive, the 
participant is considered to have latent TB infection and is excluded from the study .
Participa nts with a negative QuantiFERON®-TB test result (and a negative tuberculin skin test 
result in countries in which the QuantiFERON®-TBtest is not approved/registered or the 
tuberculin skin is mandated by [CONTACT_72952]) are eligible to continue with pre-
randomization procedures. Participants with a newly  identified positive QuantiFERON®-TB(or 
tuberculin skin) test result are excluded from the study  and must undergo an evaluation to rule 
out active TB and initiate appropriate treatment for latent TB. Appropriate treatment for latent 
TB is defined according to local country  guidelines for immunocompromised patients. If no local 
country  guidelines for immunocompromised patients exist, US guidelines must be followed. For 
a participant with an indeterm inate QuantiFERON®-TB test, the test may  be repeated once. If the 
result is indeterminate on repeat testing, the participant is considered a screen failure.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Ongoing Tuberculosis Evaluation
Early Detection of Active Tuberculosis 
To aid in the early  detecti on of TB reactivation or new TB infection during study  participation, 
participants must be evaluated for signs and symptoms of active TB at scheduled visits (refer to 
the SoA in Section 1.3)or by [CONTACT_41021] 8 to 12 weeks. The 
following series of questions is suggested for use during the evaluation: 
“Have you had a new cough of >14 day s’ duration or a change in a chronic cough?”
“Have you had an y of the following s ymptoms:

“Have you had close contact [CONTACT_41022]?” (If there is uncertaint y as 
to whether a contact [CONTACT_676500] “close,” a physician specializing in TB should be 
consulted.)
If the evaluation raises suspi[INVESTIGATOR_40958] a participant may have TB reactivation or new TB 
infection, an immediate and thorough investigation should be undertaken, including, where 
possible, consultation with a phy sician specializing in TB. 
Investigators should be aware that TB reactivation in immunocompromised participants may 
present as disseminated disease or with extrapulmonary  features. Participants with evidence of 
active TB should be referred for appropriate treatment.
Participants who experience close contact [CONTACT_356344] a repeat chest radiograph, a repeat QuantiFERON®-TB test, a repeat 
tuberculin skin test in countries in which the QuantiFERON®-TB test is not approved/registered 
or the tuberculin skin test is mandated by [CONTACT_72952], and, if possible, referral to a 
physician specializing in TB to determine the participant’s risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_676439]. Study  intervention administration should be interrupted during 
the investigation. A positive QuantiFERON®-TB test or tuberculin skin test result should be 
consider ed detection of latent TB. Participants with a positive or indeterminate 
QuantiFERON®-TBtest or positive tuberculin skin test must immediately  discontinue further 
administration of study  intervention and be encouraged to return for scheduled study  visits 
according to the SoA (Section 1.3).

also advised that active TB is considered a reportable disease in most countries. These events are 
to be considered serious only  if they  meet the definition of an SAE.
8.4. Treatment of Overdose
For this study , any  dose of study  intervention greater than t he highest dose at a single dosing visit 
specified in this protocol will be considered an overdose. The sponsor does not recommend 
specific intervention for an overdose.
In the event of an overdose, the investigator or treating ph ysician should:
Contact [CONTACT_3433] e Medical Monitor immediately .
Closely  monitor the participant for AE/SAE an d laboratory  abnormalities.
Document the quantit y of the excess dose in the eCRF.
Decisions regarding dose interruptions or modifications will be made by [CONTACT_55887].
8.5. Pharmacokinetics and Immunogenicity  
Serum samples will be used to evaluate the PK ofguselkumab and golimumab and antibodies to 
guselkumab and to golimumab , respectivel y,at the timepoints presented in the SoA 
(Section 1.3).Serum collected for PK and/or immunogenicit y may additionally  be used to 
evalua te safet y or efficacy  aspects that address concerns arising during or after the study  period,

Pharmacod ynamic markers will be evaluated using blood and fecal samples collected at visits as 
indicated in the SoA (Section 1.3).Post-baseline PDtest results will not be released to the 
investigators b y the central laboratory. 
8.7. Genetics
Genetic variation may be important contributory factors to interindividual differences in drug 
disposition, response, and clinical outcomes. Genetic (DNA) factors may also serve as markers 
for disease susceptibility  and prognosis and may identify  populatio n subgroups that respond 
differentl y to a drug. DNA samples will be analy zed for identification of genetic factors to better 
understand the molecular effects of guselkumab and/or golimumab treatment and/or UC, and to 
evaluate markers that can predict clinical response. Genetic (DNA) research may consist of the 
analysis of 1 or more candidate genes or anal ysis of the entire genome (as appropriate) in relation 
to treatment(s) and/or UC.
A pharmacogenomic whole blood sample of approximately  5mL will be collec ted (where local 
regulations permit) for genetic analyses as specified in the SoA(Section 1.3). Only  participants
who sign the consent form to participate in the genetic assessment will have whole blood DNA 
samples collected. Participation in the pharmacogenomic sub-study  is optional.
8.8. Biomarkers
Biomarker assessments will be made to examine the biologic response to treatment and to 
identify  biomarkers that are relev ant to guselkumab and/or golimumab in the treatment ofUC. 
Combination TNFand IL-23 blockade will be compared to the selective inhibition of TNF or 
IL-23. Assessments will include the evaluation of relevant biomarkers in serum , whole blood, 
stool, and mucosal biopsy  samples collected as specified in the SoA (Section 1.3).Data collected 
from these samples will be used for exploratory  research that will include the following 
objectives:
1.To understand the molecular effects of guselkumab and golimumab combination treatment 
or monotherap y of either agent.
2.To understand UC pathogenesis.
3.To understand why an individual participant may respond differentl y to guselkumab or 
golimumab.
4. To develop tests for g uselkumab, golimumab and/or UC .
Instructions for the collection and shipment of biomarker samples will be found in the 
Laboratory  Manual.
8.8.1. Serum
Serum samples for biomarker analyses will be obtained from all participants as specified in the
SoA. Analy sis of serum samples for biomarkers may include proteins associated with 
proinflammatory  and anti-inflammatory  effects, the recruitment and proliferation of cells 
associated with inflammation and repair, and markers associated with tissue injury  or repair.

Whole blood samples will be collected from all participants as specified in the SoA. Total RNA 
will be isolated and used for differential gene expression analyses to identify  mRNA or 
microRNA expr ession patterns that are relevant to guselkumab, golimumab, and/or UC. Analy sis 
will also be conducted to identify  markers that can predict clinical response.
8.8.3. Fecal 
Fecal samples will be collected from all participants as specified in the SoA. Microbiome and 
associated products analy sis will be conducted to evaluate the association between inflammatory 
proteins, microbial activities and guselkumab, golimumab , and/or UC. The relationships between 
microbiome, metabolites, and biomarkers in other tissue sampl es will also be assessed.
8.8.4. Mucosal Biopsy  (RNA , Histology , and Single Cell Isolation)
Mucosal biopsy  samples will be collected from all participants during endoscopy at the times
specified in th e SoA for RNA expression analysis ,histologic assessment , and single cell 
isolation . Total RNA will be isolated and used for differential gene expression analy ses to 
identify  mRNA or microRNA expression patterns that are relevant to guselkumab or golimumab 
treatment and/or UC, and to evaluate markers that can predict therapeutic response. Thebiops y 
samples collected will also be used for the histologic and immunohistochemical assessment of 
disease and healing. Protein and gene expression will be measured at higher resolution in various 
immune cell populations isolated from these biopsy  samples.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Optional Week 4 Endoscopy  and Biopsy Sub- study
Mucosal biopsies will be obtained at Week 4 only from participants who agree to participate in 
the optional sub-study . This optional sub-study  is included to investigate early  onset of action at 
Week 4 and to assess whether data collected at Week 4 correlate with clinical efficacy  at later 
time points. The endoscopic assessment will also be conducted for this time point. The 
endoscop y subscores will be used to calculate full Mayo scores for this timepoint (see 
Section 8.1.1 ).
8.8.5. Whole Blood (PBMC s)
Whole blood samples will be collected from all participants as specified in the SoA. Peripheral 
blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) will be isolated and used for single cellisolation. Protein and 
gene expression that are relevant to study  intervention and/or UC will be measured at higher 
resolution in PBMCs isolated from whole blood. To match with single cell analysis in colonic 
biopsies, whole blood samples will also be obtained at Week [ADDRESS_914761] 1infliximab

Statistical analy sis will be done by [CONTACT_43758]. A general
description of the statistical methods to be used to anal yze the efficacy  and safet y data is outlined 
below. Specific details will be provided i n the SAP.
Descriptive statistics (eg, mean, median, standard deviation [SD] , interquartile range, minimum, 
andmaximum) will be used to summarize continuous variables. Counts and percentages will be 
used to summarize categorical variables. Graphic aldata display s (eg, line plots) may also be 
used to summarize data.
Analy ses suitable for categorical data (eg, chi-square tests, Cochran- Mantel -Haenszel [CMH]
chi-square tests, or logistic regression, as appropriate) will be used to compare the proportions of 
participant s achieving selected endpoints (eg, clinical response). In cases of rare events, the 
Fisher ’sexact test will be used for treatment comparisons. Continuous response parameters will 
be compared using an analy sis of variance (ANOVA) oranalysis of covariance (ANCOVA ), 
unless otherwise specified. If the normality  assumption is in question, an ANOVA or ANCOVA
on the van der Waerden normal scores will be used.
Unless otherwise specified, the analy sis of endpoints related to the endoscop y subscore, 
including the Mayo score, will be based on the final reported endoscopic subscore as defined in 
Section 8.1.1 .
All statistical testing will be performed at a significance level of 0.1 (1-sided) unless otherwise 
specified. Nominal p -values will be display ed for all treatment co mparisons.

The proportion of participants in clinical response at Week 12 is expected tobe 55% for 
golimumab compared to 51% observed at Week 6 in study  C0524T17 (PURSUI T), as the 
PURSUI T program suggested that the response rate might increase slightly with further 
treatment. This was also confirmed instudy  CNTO148UCO2001 (PROgECT ).60The tested dose 
of guselkumab is assumed to have the same clinical response rate as golimumab at Week 12. The 
proportion of participa nts in clinical response at Week 12 is assumed to be 75% for the 
combination therap y, which is based on the additive effect from both monotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (20% 
improvement from each monotherap y relative to a historical placebo response of 35%). The 
different combinations of clinical response rate assumptions and associated power are display ed 
inTable 4.

[IP_ADDRESS]. Population for Efficacy  Analysis
Unless otherwise noted, efficacy  analyses will be based on the Full Analy sis Set, which is 
defined as all randomized participants who receive at least 1dose of study  intervention . 
Participants will be analy zed according to the treatment group to which they were randomized 
regardless of the treatment they  received. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Primary  Endpoint Analyses 
The primary  endpoint is clinical response at Week 12defined as a decrease from baseline in the 
Mayo score ≥30% and ≥3 points with either a decrease in RBS ≥[ADDRESS_914763] protocol -prohibited medication changes 
(to be detailed in the SAP), or who have discontinued study  intervention due to unsatisfactory 
therapeutic effect or an AE of worsening UC, before the Week 12 visit will be considered not to 
be in clinical response at Week 12, regardless of the actual May o score. 
Participants with a missing Mayo score (ie, all 4 Mayo subscore s are missing) or who do not 
return for evaluation at Week [ADDRESS_914764] stratified by [CONTACT_676465] (Y/N) will be used. 
The testing will be done simultaneously  at the 1-sided 0.1 level of significance for each 
comparison. 
The study  will be considered positive if the combination therapy  group is significantl y different 
from both monotherap y groups for the primary  endpoint. 
To examine the robustness of the primary  endpoint analy sis, sensitivity  analyses of the primary 
endpoi nt will be conducted using different missing data approaches; these analyses will be 
described in the SAP. 
Subgroup analyses of the primary  endpoint will be performed based on demographic and 
baseli ne disease characteristics, and baseline concomitant UC medication use and history of
UC-related medications. Additional subgroup analy ses of other endpoints (eg, clinical remission)
may be considered and will be described in the SAP.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Major Secondary  Endpoint A nalyses

Approved , Date: 7 March 201910.3. Appendix 3:Tuberculin Skin Testing
Administering the Mantoux Tuberculin Skin Test
The Mantoux tuberculin skin test (CDC, 2000) is the standard method of identifying persons infected with 
Mycobacterium tuberculosis . Multiple puncture tests (Tine and Heaf) should not be used to determine whether a 
person is infected because the amount of tuberculin injected intradermally cannot be precisely controlled.  
Tuberculin skin testing is both safe and reliable throughout the course of pregnancy. The Mantoux tuberculin test is 
performed by [CONTACT_676509] 0.1mL of tuberculin into the inner surface of the forearm. The test 
must be performed with tuberculin that has at least the same strength as either 5tuberculin units (TU) of standard 
purified protein derivative ([COMPANY_003]) -S or 2TU of [COMPANY_003]-RT23, Statens Seruminstitut, as recommended by [CONTACT_103210]. [COMPANY_003] strengths of 1TU or 250TU are not acceptable (Menzies, 2000). Using a disposable 
tuberculin syringe with the needle bevel facing upward, the injection should be made just beneath the surface of the 
skin. This should produce a discrete, pale elevation of the skin (a wheal) 6mm to 10mm in diameter. To prevent 
needle -stick injuries, needles should not be recapped, purposely bent or broken, removed from disposable syringes, 
or otherw ise manipulated by [CONTACT_35681]. After they are used, disposable needles and syringes should be placed in 
puncture -resistant containers for dispos al. Institutional guidelines regarding universal precautions for infection 
control (eg, the use of gloves) should be followed. A trained health care worker, preferably the investigator, should 
read the reaction to the Mantoux test [ADDRESS_914777], tuberculin testing should be repeated. The area of induration (palpable raised hardened area) around 
the site of injection is the reaction to tuberculin. For standardization, the diameter of the indur ation should be 
measured transversely (perpendicular) to the long axis of the forearm. Erythema (redness) should not be measured.  
All reactions should be recorded in millimeters, even those classified as negative.
Interpreting the Tuberculin Skin Test Res ults
In the US and many other countries, the most conservative definition of positivity for the tuberculin skin test is 
reserved for immunocompromised patients , and this definition is to be applied in this study to maximize the 
likelihood of detecting latent TB, even though the participants may not be immunocompromised at baseline.
In the US and Canada, an induration of 5mm or greater in response to the intradermal tuberculin skin test is 
considered to be a positive result and evidence for either latent or active TB.
In countries outside the US and Canada, country -specific guidelines forimmunocomprom ised patients should be 
consulted for the interpretation of tuberculin skin test results. If no local country guidelines for 
immunocompromised patients exist, US guidelines must be follow ed. 
Treatm ent of Latent Tuberculosis
Local country guidelines for immunocompromis ed patients should be consulted for acceptable antituberculous 
treatment regimens for latent TB. If no local country guidelines for immunocompromised patients exist, US 
guidelines must be follow ed.

Definitions
Woman of Childbearing Potential (WOCBP)
A woman is considered fertile following menarche and until becoming postmenopausal unless 
permanentl y sterile (see below).
Woman Not of Childbearing Potential
Premenarchal
A premenarchal state is one in which menarche has not y et occurred.
Postmenopausal
A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative 
medical cause. A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level (>40 IU/L or mIU/mL) in 
the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not 
using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy (HRT), however in the 
absence of 12months of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insufficient. If there is a 
question about menopausal status in women on HRT, the woman will be required to use one 
of the non-estrogen- containing hormonal highl y effective contraceptive methods if she 
wishes to continue HRT during the stud y.
permanently sterile
Permanent sterilization methods include hysterectomy , bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656] , bilateral 
tubal occlusion/ligation procedures, and bilateral oophorectom y.
Note: If the childbearing potential changes after start of the study  (eg, a premenarchal woman 
experiences menarche) or the risk of pregnancy  changes (eg, a woman who is not heterosexually  
active becomes active), a woman must begin a highl y effective method of contraception, as 
described throughout the inclusion criteria.
If reproductive status is questionable, additional evaluation should be considered.
As noted in Inclusion Criterion [ADDRESS_914778] dose. Examples of highl y 
effective methods of contraception are provided below; however, the method selected must meet 
local/regional regulations/guidelines for highl y effective contraception.

INFORMED CONSENT PROCESS 
Each participant must give written consent according to local requirements after the nature of the 
study  has been fully  explained. The ICF(s) must be signed before performance of any study -
related activity . The ICF(s) that is/are used must be approved by [CONTACT_170510]/I RB and be in a language that the participant can read and understand. The 
informed consent should be in accordance with principles that originated in the Declaration of 
Helsinki, curren t ICH and GCP guidelines, applicable regulatory  requirements, and sponsor 
policy .
Before enrollment in the study , the investigator or an authorized member of the study -site 
personnel must explain to potential participants the aims, methods, reasonabl y anticipated 
benefits, and potential hazards of the study ,and any discomfort participation in the study  may

investigator will maintain a participant identification register for the purposes of long-term 
follow up if needed and that their records may be accessed by [CONTACT_90819], to the extent permitted 
by [CONTACT_6983](s) or regulations. By [CONTACT_676510] . It also denotes that the participant agrees to allow his or her study  physician to recontact 
[CONTACT_676511], and 
subsequent disease -related treatments , if needed.
The p articipant will be given suf ficient time to read the I CF and the opportunity  to ask questions. 
After this explanation and before entry  into the study , consent should be appropriatel y recorded 
by [CONTACT_67824]'s personall y dated signature. After having obtained the consent, a 
copy  of the ICF must be given to the participant.
A participant may be rescreened 1 time. Participants who are rescreened are required to sign a 
new ICF.
Completion of screening and randomization procedures within the specified screening window 
of approximately  8  w eeks is required. If any delay  leads to the expi[INVESTIGATOR_356310]-specific 
assessments (eg, TB, chest radiograph, endoscopy ), the participant will be considered a screen 
failure because he/she will not meet eligibility  criteria, and the expi[INVESTIGATOR_356311] (along with 
the non- time-specific laboratory  tests) will have to be repeated on rescreening.
Participants will be asked for consent to provide optional samples for research (where local 
regulations permit). After informed consent for the study  is appropriately  obtained, the 
participant will be asked to sign and personally  date a separate ICF indicating agreement to 
participate in the optional research component. Refusal to participate in the optional research wil l 
not result in ineligibility  for the study . A cop y of this signed ICF will be given to the participant.
DATA PROTECTION

Approved , Date: 7 March 2019The investigator understands that the information developed in the study will be used by [CONTACT_676512] , and thus 
may be disclosed as required to other clinical investigators or regulatory  agencies. To permit the 
information derived from the clinical studies to be used, the investigator is obligated to provide 
the sponsor with all data obtained in the study .
The results of the study  will be reported in a Clinical Study Report generated by [CONTACT_66896]. Recruitment 
performance or specific expertise related to the nature and the key assessment parameters of the 
study  will be used to determine a coordinating investigator [INVESTIGATOR_25810] . Results of 
pharmacogenomic or exploratory  biomarker analy ses performed after the Clinical Study  Report 
has been issued will be reported in a separate report and will not require a revision of the Clini cal 
Study  Report. 
Study  participant identifiers will not be used in publication of results. Any work created in 
connection with performance of the study  and contained in the data that can benefit from 
copy right protection (except any publication by [CONTACT_40999]) shall be 
the propert y of the sponsor as author and owner of cop yright in such work.
Consistent with Good Publication Practices and International Committee of Medical Journal 
Editors (ICMJE) guidelines, the sponsor shall have the right to publish such primary 
(multicenter) data and information without approval from the investigator. The investigator has 
the right to publish study site -specific data after the primary  data are published. If an investigator 
wishes to publish information from the study ,a copy  of the manuscript must be provided to the 
sponsor for review at least 60days before submission for publication or presentation. Expedited 
reviews will be arranged for abstracts, poster presentations, or other materials. Ifrequested by 
[CONTACT_97533], the investigator will withhold such publication for up to an additional 
60days to allow for filing of a patent application. In the event that issues arise regarding 
scientific integrity  or regulatory  compliance, the sponsor will review these issues with the 
investigator. The sponsor will not mandate modifications to scientific content and does not have 
the right to suppress information. For multicenter study  designs and sub-study approaches, 
secondary  results generally should not be published before the primary  endpoints of a study  have 
been published. Similarly , investigators will recognize the integrity  of a multicenter study by [CONTACT_676513], within 18months after the study  
end date, or the sponsor confirms there will be no multicenter study  publication. Authorship of 
publications resulting from this study  will be based on the guidelines on authorship, such as 
those described in the ICMJE Recommendations for the Conduct, Reporting, Editing and 
Publication of Scholarly Work in Medical Journals, which state that the named authors must 
have made a significant contribution tothe conception or design of the work; or the acquisition, 
analysis, or interpretation of the data for the work; and drafted the work or revised it critically  for 
important intellectual content; and given final approval of the version to be published; and 
agreed to be accountable for all aspects of the work in ensuring that questions related to the 
accuracy  or integrity  of any  part of the work are appropriatel y investigated and resolved.

DATA QUA LITY ASSURA NCE
Data Quality Assurance/Quality Control
Steps to be taken to ensure the accuracy  and reliability  of data include the selection of qualified 
investigators and appropriate study  sites, review of protocol procedures with the investigator and 
study -site personnel before the study , periodic monitoring visits by [CONTACT_456] ,and direct 
transmission of clinical laboratory  data from a central l aboratory  into the sponsor's data base. 
Written instructions will be provided for collection, handling, storage, and shipment of samples. 
Guidelines for eCRF completion will be provided and reviewed with study -site personnel before 
the start of the stud y. 
The sponsor will review eCRF for accuracy  and completeness during on-site monitoring visits 
and after transmission to the sponsor; any discrepancies willbe resolved with the investigator or 
designee, as appropriate. After upload of the data into the study database they  will be verified for 
accuracy  and consistency with the data sources. 
CASE REPORT FORM COMPLETION
Data for each study  participant will be collected in the eCRF or ancillary  data collection sy stems 
such as the IWRS, PRO tablets, laboratory  database, and imaging database. Case report forms 
are prepared and provided by [CONTACT_624707]. Collectivel y, 
all data collection via eCRFs and ancillary  systems will comprise what is referred to in this 
protocol as the DCS.
All DCS entries, corrections, and alterations must be made by [CONTACT_170191] -site personnel. 
The investigator must verify  that all data entries in the eCRF are accurate and correct.
Study  data will be transcribed by [CONTACT_3449]-site personnel from source documentation to an eCRF or 
the appropriate ancillary  DCS, as applicable. Study -specific data from each source will be 
transmitted i n a secure manner to the sponsor.
Worksheets may  be used as source documentation to capture data and facilitate completion of the 
eCRF or entry  of data into the applicable ancillary  data system. Data must be entered into the 
DCS in English. The eCRF must b e completed as soon as possible after a participant visit and the 
forms should be available for review at the next scheduled monitoring visit.

The minimum source documentation requirements for Section 5.1, Inclusion Criteria and 
Section 5.2, Exclusion Criteria that specify  a need for documented medical history  are as 
follows:
Referral letter from treating ph ysician or
Complete history  of medical notes at the site
Discharge summaries
Inclusion and exclusion criteria not requiring documented medical history must be verified at a 
minimum by [CONTACT_67833] (eg, physical 
examination, laboratory  assessment) and documented in the source documents.
An electronic source (eSource )system may be utilized, which contains data traditionally 
maintained in a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_23749] (eg, electronic source 
documents) as well as the clinical study -specific data fields as determined by [CONTACT_760]. This 
data is electronically  extracted for use by [CONTACT_456]. If eSource is utilized, references made to 
the eCRF in the protocol include the eSource system but information collected through eSource 
may not be limited to that found in the eCRF.
MONITORING
The sponsor will use a combination of monitoring techniques (central, remote, and on-site 
monitoring )to monitor this study .
The sponsor will perform on-site monitoring visits as frequentl y as necessary . The monitor will 
record dates of the visits in a study  site visit log that will be kept at the study  site, as allowed by 
[CONTACT_1295]. The first post-initiation visit will be made as soon as possible after enrollment 
has begun. At these visits, the monitor will compare the data entered into the applicable DCS 
component (as defined in the monitoring guidelines) with the source documents 
(eg,hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/cli nic/phy sician’s office medical records). The nature and location of all source

Approved , Date: [ADDRESS_914782] access to source documents (medical records) must be allowed for the purpose of 
verify ing that the recorded data are consistent with the original source data. Findings from this 
review will be discussed with the study -site personnel. The sponsor expects that, during 
monitoring visits, the relevant study -site personnel will be available, the source documents will 
be accessible, and a suitable environment will be provided for review of study -related 
documents. The monitor will meet with the investigator on a regular basis during the study to 
provide feedbac k on the study conduct.
In addition to on-site monitoring visits, remote contacts can occur. It is expected that during 
these remote contacts, study -site personnel will be available to provide an update on the progress 
of the study  at the site.
Central mon itoring will take place for data identified by [CONTACT_70467].
ON-SITE A UDITS
Representatives of the sponsor's clinical quality  assurance department may visit the study  site at 
any time during or after completion of the study  to conduct an audit of the study  in compliance 
with regulatory  guidelines and company  policy . These audits will require access to all study 
records, including source documents, for inspection. Participant privacy  must, however, be 
respected. The investigator and study -site personnel are responsible for being present and 
available for consultation during routinely  scheduled study -site audit visits conducted by [CONTACT_170192]. 
Similar auditing procedures may also be conducted by [CONTACT_676515], either as 
part of a national GCP compliance program or to review the results of this study  in support of a 
regulatory  submission. The investigator should immediately  notify  the sponsor if he or she has 
been contact[INVESTIGATOR_530] b y a regulatory agency  conce rning an upcoming inspection.
RECORD RETENTION
In compliance with the ICH/GCP guidelines, the investigator/institution will maintain all eCRF 
and all source documents that support the data collected from each participant, as well as all 
study  documents as specified in ICH/GCP Section 8, Essential Documents for the Conduct of a 
Clinical Trial, and all study  documents as specified by [CONTACT_23859](s). 
The investigator/institution will take measures to prevent accidental or premature destruction of 
these documents.
Essential documents must be retained until at least 2years after the last approval of a marketing 
application in an ICH region and until there are no pending or contemplated marketing 
applications in an ICH region or until atleast 2years have elapsed since the formal 
discontinuation of clinical development of the investigational product. These documents will be

investigator/institution as to when these documents no longer need to be retained.
If the responsible investigator retires, relocates, or for other reasons withdraws from the 
responsibility  of keep ing the study  records, custody  must be transferred to a person who will 
accept the responsibility . The sponsor must be notified in writing of the name [CONTACT_23877]. Under no circumstance shall the investigator relocate or dispose of anystudy  
documents before having obtained written approval from the sponsor .
If it becomes necessary  for the sponsor or the appropriate regulatory  authority  to review any 
documentation relating to this study , the investigator/institution must permit access to such 
reports.
STUDY AND SITE CLOSURE
Study Termination
The sponsor reserves the right to close the study  site or terminate the study  at any time for any 
reason at the sole discretion of the sponsor .Study  sites will be closed upon study  completion. A 
study site is considered closed when all required documents and study  supplies have been 
collected and a study -site closure visit has been performed.
The investigator may initiate study -site closure at any time, provided there is reasonable cause 
and suffici ent notice is given in advance of the intended termination.
Reasons for the earlyclosure of a study  site by [CONTACT_11004]:
Failure of the investigator to comply  with the protocol, the requirements of the IEC/IRB or 
local health authorities, the sponsor's procedures, or GCP guidelines
Inadequate recruitment of participants by  [CONTACT_093]

Evaluating, Follow -up, and Reporting
ADVERSE EVENT DEFINITIONS AND CL ASSIFICA TIONS
Adverse Event
An adverse event is any  untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study  participant administered 
a medicinal (investigational or non-investigational) product. An adverse event does not 
necessarily  have a causal relationship with the intervention. An adverse event can therefore be 
any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal finding), symptom, or disease 
temporally  associat ed with the use of a medicinal (investigational or non-investigational) 
product, whether or not related to that medicinal (investigational or non -investigational) product. 
(Definition per International Conference on Harmonisation [I CH])
This includes any  occurrence that is new in onset or aggravated in severit y or frequency  from the 
baseline condition, or abnormal results of diagnostic procedures, including laboratory  test 
abnormalities.
Note: The sponsor collects adverse events starting with the signing ofthe ICF (refer to All 
Adverse Events under Section 8.3.[ADDRESS_914783] adverse event recording).
Serious Adverse Event
A serious adverse event based on ICH and EU Guidelines on Pharmacovigilance for Medicinal 
Products for Human Use is any  untoward medical occurrence that at an y dose:
Results in death
Is life -threaten ing
(The participant was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event that 
hypothetically  might have caused death if it were more severe.)
Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]
Results i n persistent or significant disability /incapacity
Is a congenital anomal y/birth defect
Is a suspected transmission of an y infectious agent via a medicinal product
Is Medicall y Important*
*Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is 
also appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be 
immediately  life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_676445]. These should usually  be considered serious.

An adverse event is considered unlisted if the nature or severity  is not consistent with the 
applicable product reference safet y information. For guselkumab and golimumab , the 
expectedness of an adverse event will be determined by [CONTACT_676517], respectively . 
Adverse Event Associate d With the Use of the Intervention
An adverse event is considered associated with the use of the intervention if the attribution is 
possible, probable, or very  likel yby [CONTACT_8128] (see Attribution Definitions).
ATTRIBUTION DEFINITIONS
Not Related
An adverse event that is not related to the use of the intervention.
Doubtful
An adverse event for which an alternative explanation is more likely , eg,concomitant 
treatment(s), concomitant disease(s), or the relationship in time suggests that a causal 
relationship is unlikely .
Possible
An adverse event that might be due to the use of the intervention. An alternative explanation, 
eg,concomitant treatment(s), concomitant disease(s), is inconclusive. The relationship in time is 
reasonable; theref ore, the causal relationship cannot be excluded.
Probable
An adverse event that might be due to the use of the intervention. The relationship in time is 
suggestive (eg,confirmed by [CONTACT_23827]). An alternative explanation is less likely , 
eg,concomitant t reatment(s), concomitant disease(s).
Very Likely
An adverse event that is listed as a possible adverse reaction and cannot be reasonabl y explained 
by [CONTACT_4867], eg,concomitant treatment(s), concomitant disease(s). The 
relationship in time is very suggestive (eg, it is confirmed by  [CONTACT_35719]).
SEVERITY CRITERIA  
An assessment of severity  grade will be made using the following general categorical 
descriptors:
Mild : Awareness of symptoms that are easily tolerated, causing minimal discomfort and not 
interfering with every day activities.
Moderate : Sufficient discomfort is present to cause interference with normal activity .

experienced b y the participant (eg, laboratory  abnormalities).
SPECIA L REPORTING SITUA TIONS
Special reporting situations must be reported by [CONTACT_676518] [ADDRESS_914784] on a sponsor study  intervention in an interventional study  that may require expedited 
reporting or safet y evaluation include, but are not limited to:
Overdose of a sponsor study  intervention
Suspected abuse/misuse of a sponsor stud y intervention
Accidental or occupational exposure to a sponsor study  intervention
Any failure of expected pharmacologic action (ie,lack of effect) of a sponsor study 
intervention
Unexpected therapeutic or clinical benefit from use of a sponsor study  intervention
Medication error involving a sponsor product (with or without participant/patient exposure 
to the sponsor study  intervention, eg, name [CONTACT_2976])
Exposure to a sponsor study  intervention from breastfeeding
Special reporting situations should be recorded in the eCRF. Any special reporting situation that 
meets the criteria of a serious adverse event should be recorded on the serious adverse event page 
of the eCRF.
PROCEDURES
All Adverse Events
All adverse events, regardless of seriousness, severit y, or presumed relationship to study  
intervention, must be recorded using medical terminology  in the source document and the eCRF. 
Whenever possible, diagnoses should be given when signs and symptoms are due to a common 
etiology  (eg, cough, runny  nose, sneezing, sore throat, and head congestion should be reported as 
"upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_23739]"). Investigators must record in the eCRF their opi[INVESTIGATOR_117113] y. All measures required for adverse event 
management must be recorded in the source document and reported according to sponsor 
instructions.
For all studies with an outpatient phase, including open -label studies, the participant must be 
provided with a "wallet (study )card" and instructed to carry  this card with them for the duration 
of the study  indicating the following: 
Study  number
TREMFYA (guselkumab )

Investigator's name [INVESTIGATOR_1238] 24-hour contact [CONTACT_23828]
Local sponsor's name [INVESTIGATOR_1238] [ADDRESS_914785] telephone number (for medical staf f onl y)
Site number
Participant number
Any other information that is required to do an emergency  breaking of the blind
Serious Adverse Events
All serious adverse events that have not resolved by [CONTACT_2054] , or that have not 
resolved upon discontinuation of the participant's participation in the study , must be followed 
until any  of the following occurs:
The event resolves
The event stabilizes
The event returns to baseline, if a baseline value/status is available
The event can be attributed to agents other than the study  intervention or to factors unrelated 
to study conduct
It becomes unlikel y that any additional information can be obtained (participant or health 
care practitioner refusal to provide additional information, lost to follow -up after 
demonstration of due diligence with follow -up efforts)
Suspected transmission of an infectious agent by a medicinal product will be reported as a 
serious adverse event. Any event requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (or prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) 
that occurs during the course of a participant's participation in a study  must be reported as a 
serious adverse event, except hospi[INVESTIGATOR_23741]:
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_23742] (eg, social reasons 
such as pending placement in long -term care facility )
Surgery  or procedure planned before entry  into the study  (must be documented in the 
eCRF). Note: Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_23743], and where 
the underl ying condition for which the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_23744], will 
not be considered serious adverse events. Any  adverse event that results in a prolongation of 
the originall y planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_23745] a new serious adverse event.
The cause of death of a participant in a study within [ADDRESS_914786] dose of study 
intervention, whether or not the event is expected or associated with the study  intervention, is 
considered a serious adverse event.

Approved , Date: 7 March 201910.10. Appendix 10: A nticipated Events 
Anticipated Event
An anticipated event is an adverse event (serious or non-serious) that commonly  occurs as a 
consequence of the underly ing disease or condition under investigation (disease -related) or 
background regimen.
For the purposes of this study  the following events will be considered anticipated events: 
Adverse Events Associated with the Study Population
Adverse events related to sy mptoms of UC
Adverse events related to worsening or progression of UC
Reporting of Anticipated Events
All adverse events will be recorded in the eCRF regardless of whether considered to be 
anticipated events and will be reported to the sponsor as described under All Adverse Events in 
Section 8.3.1, Time Period and Frequency  for Collecting Adverse Event and Serious Adverse 
Event Information. Any anticipated event that meets serious adverse event criteria will be 
reported to the sponsor as described under Serious Adverse Events in Section 8.3.1 , Time Period 
and Frequency  for Collecting Adverse Event and Serious Adverse Event Information. These 
anticipated events are exempt from expedited reporting as individual single cases to Health 
Authorities. However if based on an aggregate review, it is determined that an anticipated event 
is possibly  related to study  intervention, the sponsor will report these events in an expedited 
manner.
Anticipated Event Review Committee (ARC) 
An Anticipated Event Review Committee (ARC) will be established to perform reviews of pre -
specified anticipated events at an aggregate level. The ARC is a safet y committee within the 
sponsor’s organization that is independent of the sponsor’s study  team. The ARC will meet to aid 
in the recommendation to the sponsor’s study  team as to whether there is a reasonable possibility  
that an anticipated event is related to the study  intervention.
Statistical Analysis
Details of statist ical analy sis of anticipated events, including the frequency  of review and 
threshold to trigger an aggregate analysis of anticipated events will be provided in a separate 
Anticipated Events Safety Monitoring Plan (ASMP).

for improved treatment.  
 
Tumor angiogenesis plays an essential role in cancer growth and 
metastasis , and t herapi[INVESTIGATOR_105884] a 
variety of malignancies . In advanced gastric and GEJ adenocarcinoma , 
ramucirumab (a monoclonal antibody against VEGFR2) has 
demonstrated clinical activity and has been approved as second line 
therapy . However, the clinical benefit and impact on tumor control is 
modest and transient  with 8% of objective response rate and  [ADDRESS_117596] but can exhibit multiple angiogenic pathways at the 
outset.  The efficacy of dual antiangiogenic blockade such as 
bevacizumab plus sorafenib, a vascular disrupting agent (OXi4503) plus 
bevacizuma b and a PDGFR inhibitor (SU6668) plus a VEGFR2 inhibitor 
(semaxinib) has been confirmed in preclinical and clinica l studies.  
 
TAS 102 is an oral cytotoxic agent with two active components; 
trifluridine which inhibits tumor cell growth by [CONTACT_105911] d into 
DNA during DNA synthesis and tipi[INVESTIGATOR_105885], thereby [CONTACT_105912]. Tipi[INVESTIGATOR_105886] s platelet derived endothelial cell growth factor  (PDEG F) which 
plays a key role  with VEGF  in tumor angiogenesis.  The combination of a 
cytotoxic agent with an antiangiogenic agent has demonstrated a 
significant anticancer activity in multiple cancers by [CONTACT_105913].  
 
As there are known synergy of dual antiangiogenic therapy, and the 
combination of a cytotoxic agent with an antiangiogenic agent, t he 
combination of TAS 102 with ramucirumab may potentially produce a 
synergistic tumor response by [CONTACT_105914] (VEGF and 
PDEGF) and by [CONTACT_105915], tortuous and hyperpermeable 
tumor vasculature.    
 
We hypothesize that a combination of TAS 102 and ramucirumab might 
increase efficacy without causing unmanageable toxicity .

MCC # [ADDRESS_117605] leading cause of global cancer related death worldwide with 
approximately one million new cases diagnosed each year1. In 2017, 28,000 new cases of gastric 
cancer and 10,960 deaths are predicted in the [LOCATION_002]2. In spi[INVESTIGATOR_105887], surgery and chemotherapy, the overall 
clinical outcome  for patients with advanced gastric cancer is poor with median overall survival 
of 4-6 months3. The treatment of patients with advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction 
(GEJ) adenocarcinoma is quite challenging. Although  chemotherapy regimens including  
docetaxel, capecitabine, irinotecan, cisplatin and oxaliplatin  have showed  significant survival 
benefit  in advanced gastric cancer4,  a majority of patients experience disease progression within 
6 months and die within 1 year of systemic treatment5. Recent clinical studies demonstrated that 
chemotherapy combined with trastuzumab significantly improved clinical outcome in patients 
with human epi[INVESTIGATOR_105888] 2 (HER -2) overexpressing gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma6. 
Unfortunately, HER -2 overexpressing tumor s represent approximately 20% of the total number 
of gastric and GEJ adenocarcinoma6,7. Therefore, there is a significant unmet need for new 
therapeutic approach to im prove clinical outcome of patients with the advanced gastric and GEJ 
adenocarcinoma . 
 
 Angiogenesis  
Angiogenesis is essenti al for tumor growth and metastasis. The increase in the tumor size and the 
functional abnormality of tumor vasculature result in tumor necrosis and tissue hypoxia which 
stimulates angiogenesis by [CONTACT_105918]8. The binding of VEGF to VEGF 
receptors (VEGFR) regulates the angiogenesis si gnaling. Among [ADDRESS_117606] to normal vessels, tumor ca pi[INVESTIGATOR_105889], blunt -end and chaotic in their 
organization14, and blood f low does not reach each region of the tumor equally. Notably, the 
blood flow abnormalities induced by [CONTACT_105919] , chemotherapy and immunotherapy  by [CONTACT_105920]15,16. 
Therefore, tumor angiogenesis is essential not only for tumor progression and metastasis but al so 
for resistance to anticancer therapy.  
 
MCC # [ADDRESS_117607] shown that 
VEGFR2 is the main mediator of several physiological and pathological effects including 
proliferation, migration, survival and permeability of endothelial cells in tumor angiogenesis17. 
Based on the importance of VEGFR2 in tumor angiogenesis, antibod ies targeting VEGFR 2 
(ramucirumab ) was developed, and ramucirumab  and its murine version, DC -101 showed to  
inhibit angiogenesis a nd the growth of several mouse and human tumors in preclinical studies18, 
providing evidence that the blockade of VEGFR2 is an effective strategy for the treatment of 
human cancer.   
 
Clinical Experience  
 
Clinical Pharmacokinetics  
Ramucirumab Fab fragments has high binding affinity (0.1nmol/L) to VEGFR2 effectively 
blocking VEGF binding (50% inhibitory concentration=1 -2nmol/L) and causing inhibition of 
VEGF induced intracellular calcium mobilization and endothelial cell migration, mitogenesis 
and proliferation in vitro19. Ramu cirumab has been evaluated in human subjects in multiple 
studies at doses ranging from  2mg/kg to 16mg/kg . A mean half -life of ramucirumab is 14 -15 
days and at doses of ≥8mg/kg, the clearance profile of ramucirumab remains relatively stable20, 
indicating saturation of the VEGFR2 mediated clearance pathway. Maximum tolerated dose is 
13mg/kg once weekly21. Given the pharm acokinetics , 8mg/kg every 2 weeks is used for 
metastatic gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma . 
 
Clinical Efficacy  
In a phase III study, r amucirumab demonstrated significant prolongation of median overall 
survival (OS)  compared with placebo (5.2 vs 3.8 months) and improv ed 6 month overall  survival 
rates  from 31.6% to 41.8% in the second -line setting of advanced gastric and GEJ 
adenocarcinoma22. Another phase III study showed th at ramucirumab plus paclitaxel was 
associated with high objective response (28% vs 16%), improved median PFS (4.4 vs 2.9 
months) and median OS (9.6 vs 7.4 months) compared with paclitaxel in refractory advanced 
gastric and GEJ adenocarcinoma23. Based on the two phase III studies, r amucirumab alone or 
combined with paclitaxel  has been approved for the treatment of advanced gastric and GEJ 
adenocarcinoma  following first -line therapy.  
 
Clini cal Safety  
Ramucirumab is generally well tolerated. The most common adverse events are fatigue, 
abdominal pain, decreased appetite, hypertension, vomiting and anemia.  
The warnings and precautions for ramucirumab  include: hemorrhage, arterial thrombotic events, 
gastrointestinal perforation, hypertension, reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome, 
wound healing impairment and bone marrow suppression . 
 
MCC # [ADDRESS_117608] and cell death by  [CONTACT_105921] . Trifluridine retains 
antitumor activity in 5 -FU resistant tumor cells24. However, trifluridine is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_105890] (first -pass effect), and tipi[INVESTIGATOR_14965]  (another component of 
TAS 102)  helps to maintain adequate trifluridine  plasma concentration by [CONTACT_105922]  (known as platelet derived endothelial cell growth factor) . In addition 
to enhance ment of trifluridine’s bioavailability by [CONTACT_105923] , tipi[INVESTIGATOR_105891] (PDE GF) which 
plays a key role with VEGF in tumor angiogenesis25. PDEGF protects cancer cells from hypoxia - 
or chemotherapy - induced apoptosis by [CONTACT_105924] C,

independent of its synergism with trifluridine.   
 
Pre-Clinical Experience  
 
Preclinical studies demonstrated  that TAS 102, the combination of trifluridine and tipi[INVESTIGATOR_105892]29. Interestingly, trifluridine and TAS 102 showed antitumor activity in 
cancer cells and xenograft models in both 5 -FU naïve and 5 -FU resistant tumor cells30. Inhibition 
of neovascular formation by [CONTACT_105925][INVESTIGATOR_105893] a gelatin -sponge mouse model29. 
 
Clinical Experience  
 
Clinical Pharmacokinetics  
TAS 102  has been tested in multiple clinical trials  with doses ranging from 30mg/m2/day to 160 
mg/m2/day (trifluridine dose) . MTD was 70mg/m2/day when given twice a day on days 1 -5 and 
8-12 of a 28 day cycle31. Postprandial administration is recommended for TAS 102 because 
trifluridine’s area under the curve is not changed by [CONTACT_105926] d but the maximum concentration of 
trifluridine decreases in neutrophils with postprandial administration32. Half-life of trifluridine 
and tipi[INVESTIGATOR_105894] 2.1 hours and 2.4 hours, respectively. Given the pharmacokinetics, 35mg/m2 twice 
daily within 1 hour of completion of morning and evening meals on days 1 to 5 and days 8 to 12 
of a 28 day cycle is used for metastatic colorectal cancer.  TAS 102 is not metabolized by 
[CONTACT_9058] P450 (CYP) enzymes.  
 
 
Clinical Efficacy  
TAS 102  has been FDA approved for the treatment of meta static colorectal cancer based on

Version 1.7  
 prolongation of median OS (7.1 vs 5.3 months) compared with placebo in a phase III study33.  In 
a recent phase II study, TAS 102 was evaluated in patients with refractory advanced gastric 
cancer34. The median PFS and OS were 2.9 months and 8.7 months, respectively with disease 
control rate of 65.5%  in the study .   
 
Clinical Safety  
The most common adverse events are anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, fatigue, nausea, 
decreased appetite, diarrhea, vomiting and abdominal pain.  Grade 3 or high er neutropenia has 
been observed in 34% with 2% of febrile neutropenia, and there was no grade 5 toxicity related 
neutropenia in a randomized phase III study of TAS [ZIP_CODE]. Interestingly, neutropenia caused by 
[CONTACT_19095] 102 was associated with improved disease control rate and improved progression free 
survival in several studi es36,37. 
The warning s and precautions for TAS 102  include: bone marrow suppression, gastrointestinal 
toxicity, hepatic impairment and renal impairment . 
 Rationale  
The combination of TAS 102 and ramucirumab may potentially produce a synergistic tumor 
response by [CONTACT_105927] (VEGF and PDEGF) and enhanced delivery of cytotoxic trifluridine to tumor 
through normalization of poorly organized, tortuous and hyperpermeable tumor vasculature.    
 
Dual antiangiogenic therapy has been proposed as tumors can not only develop resistance to one 
anti-angiogenic pathway but also exhibit multiple angiogenic pathways at the outset . The 
efficacy of dual antiangiogenic blockade such as bevacizumab plus sorafe nib, a vascular 
disrupting agent (OXi4503) plus bevacizumab and a PDGFR inhibitor (SU6668) plus a VEGFR2 
inhibitor (semaxinib) has been confirmed in preclinical and clinical studies38, although toxicity 
remains a concern . 
  
The combination of a cytotoxic agent with an antiangiogenic agent has demonstrated a 
significant anticancer act ivity in multiple cancers including gastric cancer, colorectal cancer, 
non-small cell lung cancer and ovarian cancer . The proposed mechanisms of benefit from the 
chemotherapy plus antiangiogenesis include  1) normalization of the tumor vasculature by 
[CONTACT_105928]39, 2) synergistic effects leading to 
enhanced direct cytotoxicity of cancer cells and/or endothelial cells40 and 3) decreased 
chemoresistance by [CONTACT_105929]41 and Wnt/β -catenin 
signaling42. The combination of TAS 102 with VEGF inhibition ( bevacizumab ) was evaluated in 
preclinical  and clinical  studies, and the combination showed superior antitumor efficacy to TAS 
102 alone by [CONTACT_105930]43,44.  In addition, TAS 102 (35 mg/m2 twice a 
day) was safely combined with bevacizumab  (5mg/kg every 2 weeks) without dose limiting 
toxicities in a phase1/2 study44.  
 
As there are known synergy of dual antiangiogenic therapy and the combination of a cytotoxic  
agent with an antiangiogenic agent  in preclinical and clinical studies , we hypothesize that TAS 
102 added to ramucirumab  will lead to a disease response and improve survival in refractory 
metastatic gastric and GEJ adenocarcinoma .

reasons:  
• Subject withdraws consent from study treatment and study procedures. A subject must be 
removed from the trial at his/her own request or at the request of his/her legally 
acceptable representative. At any time during the trial and without giving reasons, a 
subject may decline to participate further. The subject will not suffer any disadvantage as 
a result.  
• Pregnancy.  Pregnancies will be reported to Taiho  within [ADDRESS_117624] be withdrawn 
from the trial immediately . (Note: subjects who have been withdrawn from treatment 
with study drug because of pregnancy should not undergo CT scans [with contrast]/MRI 
or bone scans while pregnant.)  
• If, in the investigator's opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], continuation of the trial would be harmful to the subject's 
well-being.  
• Subject is lost to follow -up. 
• Deat h. 
 
All subjects who discontinue should comply with protocol specified follow -up and survival 
procedures. The ONLY exception to this requirement is when a subject withdraws con sent for all

incarcerated for the treatment of either a psychiatric or physical illness). If a subject was 
withdrawn before completing the study, the reason for withdrawal must be entered on the 
appropriate case report form page.  
 
Subjects  may be  withdrawn from study treatment  for the following reasons:  
• The subject is non -compliant with TAS 102  administration, ramucirumab  
administration, or trial procedures ; including the use of anti -cancer therapy not 
prescribed by [CONTACT_105931]. 
• Severe  allergic reaction to TAS 102  or ramucirumab . 
• The development of a second cancer.  
• Development of  an illness or situation which would, in the judgment of the 
investigator, significantly affect assessments of clinical status and trial endpoints.  
• Deterioration of ECOG performance status to 3 or 4.  
• Use of illicit drugs or other substances that may, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], 
have a reasonable chance of contributing to toxicity or otherwise skewing trial result.  
Any subject removed from the tr ial will remain under medical supervision until discharge or 
transfer is medically acceptable.  
Any subject with progression of disease will come off of treatment  except for patients deriving 
clinical benefit as deemed by [CONTACT_458]  [CONTACT_4490] a maximum of [ADDRESS_117625]'s 
medical records.  
4.3.1 Screen Failures/Dropouts /Replacements  
A subject who discontinues study participation prematurely for any reas ons except death, disease 
progression and severe toxicity is defined as a dropout.  
A subject who, for any reason (e.g., failure to satisfy the selection criteria), terminates the study 
before the time point used for the definition of “dropout” (see above) is regarded a “screening 
failure”.  
Subjects who withdraw from treatment ( for any reason) may be replaced . 
4.3.2 Patient Replacement  
Dropout (see 4.3.1  for definition of “dropout”) patients will need to be replaced.  
Patients will be replaced if they come off trea tment without any response evaluation for reasons 
other than drug related AE or disease progression .

 Drug Administration  
 
Ramuciruma b 
Ramucirumab is provided as a liquid solution at a concentration of 10mg/ml in either 100mg 
(10ml) or 500mg (50ml) single dose vials . The drug product is stored as a liquid solution in a 
refrigerator at 2°C to 8°C until time of use.  Ramucirumab is a sterile, preservative -free, clear to 
slightly opalescent and colorless to slightly yellow solution for intra venous infusion following 
dilution and preparation . After withdrawal of the required volume of ramucirumab from the 
vials, it can be further diluted with only 0.9% sodium chloride in an intravenous infusion 
container to a final volume of 250ml. The diluted  ramucirumab can be administerd via infusion 
pump over 60 minutes  (±15minutes) through a separate infusion line. When patients develop 
infusion reaction, we will follow [IP_ADDRESS].1 infusion related reaction management. The diluted 
ramucirumab solutions may b e stored at room temperature for up to 4 hours or at 2 to 8°C for up 
to 24 hours.    
 
TAS 102  
TAS 102 should be administered orally twice a  day within 1 hour of completion of morning and 
evening meals on Days 1 through 5 and Days 8 through 12 of each 28-day cycle. The table ts

with this combination, we will closely monitor first [ADDRESS_117629] 28 days. If none or one of 
these patients has a dose limiting toxicity, we will continue without dose adjustment. If  ≥ 2 
patients has a dose li miting toxicity, the dose will be decreased to level -1 (TAS 102: 30mg/m2 
twice a day and ramucirumab: 8mg/kg Q2W, details in table 1), and [ADDRESS_117630] 28 days, we will use dose level -1. If  ≥ [ADDRESS_117631] 6 or 12 patients depending on dose limiting toxicities 
will be used for primary and second ary objectives. Dose limiting toxicity is defined as a grade 3 
or higher non -hematological toxicity excluding controllable nausea, vomiting, hypertension, 
diarrhea, transient electrolyte abnormalities and alopecia; grade 4 neutropenia lasting 7 days or 
more; grade 3 or higher febrile neutropenia; grade 4 thrombocytopenia.

Criteria for dose hold and resumption in response to hematologic toxicities related to 
myelosu ppression are described in Table 2.  
Uncomplicated neutropenia or thrombocytopenia ≤ grade 3 does not require a reduction in dose 
of study medication. Patients who experience uncomplicated Grade 4 neutropenia or 
thrombocytopenia that results in a >1 week d elay of the start of the next cycle should start the 
next cycle with dose reduction in 5mg/m2 step. If toxicity remains despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] 4 dose reductions or at

• If there are no complications (such as fever, infection or hemorrhage), there is no need 
to reduce the dose of TAS 102  
• If there are complications, the necessity of reducing dose should be considered also 
with regard to safety.  
• For neutropenia , pegfilgrastim or filgrastim can be administered at investigator’s 
discretion . 
  2) Grade 4 neutropenia or thrombocytopenia  
• When there are no complications, but initiation of the next cycle is delayed by [CONTACT_105933], dose should be reduced by 1 level (Table 1) when starting next cycle 
(dose is not reduced when administered on the same weekday) . If initiation is not 
delay ed by [CONTACT_74563], the next cycle can be initiated at the same dose level.  
• If there are complications, in consideration of the safety of the patient, dose should be 
reduced by 1 level (Table 1) when starting the next cycle.  
• For neutropenia, pegfilgrastim or filgrastim can be administered at investigator’s 
discretion . 
 
[IP_ADDRESS].3  Dose resumption timing of TAS 102  
If the patient recovers from the toxicities to the resumption criteria defined above during the 2 -
week  treatment period (trea tment Days 1 through 5, 8 through 12), and no dose reduction is 
required, study  drug therapy may be resumed during that cycle.  
If a dose reduction is required, study drug therapy  should be resumed at the start of the next 
cycle at the appropriate dose lev el according to instructions  provided in Table [ADDRESS_117633] not be increased for subsequent  cycles .  
If the toxicities that are defined above recover during the recovery period (Days 13 through 28), 
start the next cyc le on schedule at the appropriate dose level according to instructions provided 
in Table [ADDRESS_117634]  period, the start 
of the next cycle can be delayed for a maximum of 2 8 days from the scheduled start  date of the 
next cycle. If resumption criteria are met by [CONTACT_105934] 28 -day delay, start the next  cycle at

 [IP_ADDRESS].7  Reversible posterior leukoencepha lopathy syndrome  (RPLS)  
• Reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS) is a clinical and radiologic 
syndrome typi[INVESTIGATOR_105900] -
imaging findings of subcortical edema involving the poster ior circulation, particularly the 
occipi[INVESTIGATOR_33934]. The symptoms of RPLS most often include generalized seizures, 
headache, delirium, and cortical blindness, although these may vary significantly and 
occasionally include focal neurological deficits.  Magneti c resonance imaging (MRI) 
represents the most reliable method for the diagnosis. Clinical symptoms and MRI 
abnormalities usually recover within days to weeks with proper management, although 
permanent neurologic dysfunction has been reported.  
• Because hype rtension is an identified risk for ramucirumab, investigators should control 
BP. In addition, investigators should consider a diagnosis of RPLS in the setting of 
seizures, headache, nausea, delirium, visual changes, and/or other unexplained 
neurological sy mptoms, especially in combination with hypertension and MRI findings 
of hyperintensity on T2 -weighted and fluid -attenuated inversion recovery images  
• If the diagnosis of RPLS is confirmed, ramucirumab DP should be permanently 
discontinued.   
 
[IP_ADDRESS].8  Cardiac events  
• Patients with symptomatic CHF, unstable angina pectoris, or symptomatic or poorly 
controlled cardiac arrhythmia should not be enrolled in this study.  
• Ramucirumab should be discontinued in the event of any Grade 3 -4 events consistent 
with CHF.  
[IP_ADDRESS].9  Surgery and impaired wound healing  
• Surgery and impaired wound healing have been observed with some antiangiogenic 
agents.  
• Ramucirumab will not be administered to patients who have undergone major surgery 
within [ADDRESS_117638] undergone central venous access device p lacement within 7 days 
prior to ramucirumab adminstration.  
• Patients with postoperative and other nonhealing wound complications are excluded, as 
are patients for whom major surgical procedures are planned .

8. Safety  monitoring  and reporting  
 Adverse Events  
8.1.1 Definitions  
 
A serious  adverse  event  is an undesirable sign,  symptom or  medical  condition  which:  
1. Is fatal or life-threatening.  
2. Requires  or prolongs  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
3. Results  in persistent  or significant  disability/incapacity.  
4. Constitutes  a congenital  anomaly  or a birth  defect.  
5. Is medically  significant,  may jeopardize  the subject and may require medical  or surgical 
MCC # [ADDRESS_117650] or other  
means,  will be collected  and recorded  and followed  as appropriate.  An adverse  event  is any 
undesirable  sign,  symptom  or medical  condition  occurring  after starting study treatment . 
Medical  conditions/diseases  present  before  starting  study  treatment  are only considered  
adverse  events  if they worsen  after starting  study  treatment.  Abnormal  laboratory  values  or 
test results  constitute  adverse  events  only if they induce clinical  signs  or symptoms  or require 
therapy.  
Full information from serious adverse event s as well as adverse events concerning medication 
errors and overdose  will be reported to Taiho Drug Safety or Designee . This can be performed 
by [CONTACT_105937] (609) 750 -7371 or via e -mail at TAS -
[EMAIL_2082]  (please note the underscore between ‘102’ and ‘Safety’).  
In addition  to the  above,  fatal events  will also be documented  by a separate  death  form,  
instead  of reporting  them  as AE CTCAE grade.  
Events  not considered  to be serious  adverse  events  are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_105903]:  
• Routine   treatment   or  monitoring   of  the  studied   indication,   not  associated   with  any 
deterioration  in condition.  
• Treatment,  which  was elective  or pre-planned,  for a pre-existing  condition  that did not 
worsen.  
• Treatment   on  an  emergency,   outpatient   basis   for  an  event   not  fulfilling   any  of  the 
definitions  of serious  given  above  and not resulting  in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_105904].  
Pregnancy,  although  not itself  a serious  adverse  event,  should  also be reported  on a serious  
adverse  event  form  or pregnancy  form  and be followed  up to determine  outcome,  including  
spontaneous  or voluntary  termination,  details  of birth,  and the presence  or absence  of any 
birth  defects  or congenital  abnormalities.  
Only  the serious  adverse  event  occurring  after the patient has started  taking  the study  
medication,  and until [ADDRESS_117651] of monitoring and recording  all adverse events and serious 
adverse events, the regular monitoring of hematology and blood chemistry parameters and 
regular physical examinations. Adverse events will be evaluated continuously throughout the 
study. Safety and tolerability will be asses sed according to the NIH/NCI Common Terminology

Protocol Monitoring Committee  (PMC ); 
The PMC monitors its assigned ongoing research protocols for: adverse event reporting, data and 
safety monitoring, and internal audit findings. The PMC, upon review of any agenda item, may 
approve the study for continuation, require revisions, suspend or close a protocol.  
 
The PMC meets monthly and reviews accrual, patterns and frequencies of all adverse events, 
protocol violations and when applicable, internal audit results.   
 
 
Investigators of studies which are designated to be revi ewed by [CONTACT_105938], shall provide a statistical report of the study’s progress and summary of adverse 
events and deviations based on the phase of the study and the associated risk of the study or more 
often if applicable.  
 
8.2.1 Internal Monitoring Plan  
 
Data will be captured in OnCore, Moffitt’s Clinical Trials Database.  
Regulatory documents and case report forms will be monitored internally according to Moffitt 
Cancer Center Monitoring Policies. Monitoring will be performed regular ly by [CONTACT_105939], completeness, and source verification of data entry, validation of 
appropriate informed consent process, reporting of SAEs, and adherence to the protocol, Good 
Clinical  Practice (GCP) guidelines, and app licable regulatory requirements.  
 
 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events  
All AEs will be recorded  on the appropriate  CRF.  The Investigator  will also identify  the date 
of onset,  date of resolution,  seriousness,  outcome,  and the relationship  to study  drug.  Every  
effort  should  be made  to determine  the cause  of each AE and whether  or not it is related  to the 
study  drugs. The relationship  of the AE to the study  drug must  be rated  and recorded  following  
the guidelines  outlined  in the CTCAE  v5. All the AEs will be reviewed  by [CONTACT_11097] [INVESTIGATOR_7966].  The 2 categories  for AE grading  are: 
 
1. Definite  
2. Probable  
3. Possible  
4. Unlike  
5. Unrelated  
The definition of serious adverse events (SAEs) is given in Section 8.1.1.  
Each serious adverse event must be followed up until resolution or stabilization, by [CONTACT_105940] # [ZIP_CODE]  
37 
Version 1.7  
 of updated reports to the designated person. An isolated laboratory abnormality that is assigned 
grade 4, according to CTC definition, is not reportable as an S AE; unless the investigator 
assesses that the event meets standard ICH criteria for an SAE.  CTC grade 4 baseline laboratory 
abnormalities that are part of the disease profile should not be reported as an SAE, specifically 
when they are allowed or not excl uded by [CONTACT_39719]/exclusion criteria.   
 
To ensure patient safety, each serious advers e event must be reported to Dr. K im expeditiously. 
Moffitt Ca ncer Center w ill report SAEs by [CONTACT_105941], the electronic 
data capture system. If applicable, the site should also follow protocol guidelines for additional 
reporting to government agencies.  
 
When required, and according to local law and regulations, serious adverse events must be 
reported to the Ethics Committee and Regulatory Authorities.   
 
All serious adverse events should be reported to  Taiho Drug Safety or Designee  within [ADDRESS_117652] becomes aware of the SAE. Comprehensive information 
available at the time of initial reportin g (including narrative description, medical history and 
concomitant medications) needs to be provided with careful considerations regarding causality 
and serious criterion .  In the event of such an event, the investigator should refer to the 
Pharmacovigila nce section of the contract for reporting procedures.

 Pregnancies  
Although pregnancy and lactation are not considered adverse events, it is the responsibility of 
investigators or their designees to report any pregnancy or lactation in a subject (spontaneously 
reported to them) that occurs during the trial.  
Pregnancies and lactations that occur after the consent form is signed but before treatment 
allocation/randomization must be reported by [CONTACT_105943], or are the result of a protocol -specified intervention, including but not 
limited to washout or discontinuation of usual therapy, diet, p lacebo treatment or a procedure.

9.   Statistical Methods  and Data  Analysis  
 
 Definition of Study  Endpoint s 
To meet the objectives for this study, data for the following endpoints will be collected:  
• Safety and Tolerability  
• Tumor response by [CONTACT_393] 1.1 (Secondary)  
• Exploratory biomarkers  and cytokine multiples assay  (Exploratory)  
 Determination of sample size  
The primary objective of this study is overall survival at 6 months. Overall survival (OS) will be 
defined as the time from starting on trial to date of death due to any cause.  Dropouts/screen 
failures defined in section 4.3.1. Patients will be considered inevaluable for the primary endpoint 
of [ADDRESS_117655] the null hypothesis of ≤4 5% of OS at [ADDRESS_117656] the alternative 
of ≥70% of OS at 6 month.   The sample size was determined based on the Simon’s two -stage 
minimax design.  With one -sided 10% of type I error rate and 90% power, a sample of evaluable 
25 patients will be evaluated; [ADDRESS_117657] good activity if ≥15 out of 2 5 patients survive 6 months or 
more.  We will continue to recruit patients during interim analysis  
 
MCC # [ZIP_CODE]  
39 
Version 1.7  
 
 Statistical analysis  
Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from startin g on trial to date of death due to any 
cause and progression -free survival (PFS) is defined as the duration of time from start of 
treatment to time of progression or death, whichever comes first. The  final analysis will be 
conducted after the follow -time o f the last patient exceeds [ADDRESS_117658] good activity if ≥15 
out of 25 evaluable patients survive 6 months or more. OS will be estimated using the Kaplan -
Meier method and the two -sided 95% confidence interval (CI) for median OS will be computed 
using log -log transformation.  
The secondary endpoints in this study include toxicity, PFS and the objective response rate  
(ORR) defined as ( complete response ( CR) + partial response ( PR)) using RECIST 1.1 criteria 
(Appendix A). ORR will be reported with 95% CI computed by [CONTACT_39715] -Pearson method. 
The frequency and severity of adverse events and tolerability of the regimen will be summarized 
using descriptive statis tics. PFS with 95% CI will be estimated. As exploratory objective, the 
association between biomarkers and clinical outcomes ( ORR , OS and PFS) will be examined 
using multiple logistic regression and the multivariable Cox regression model. A p -value of 
<0.[ADDRESS_117659] (IRB) Approval a nd Consent 
It is expected that the IRB will have the proper representation and function in accordance 
with federally mandated regulations.  The IRB should approve the consent form and 
protocol. 
 
In obt aining  and documenting informed consent, the investigator should comply with the  
applicable regulatory requirement(s), and should  adhere to Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and to 
ethical principles that have their origin in the  Declaration of Helsinki. 
 
Before recruitment and enrollment onto this study, the patient will be given a full explanation of  
the study and will be given the  oppo rtunity  to review the consent form. Each consent form must 
include all the relevant elements currently required by [CONTACT_105946].  Once this essential information has been pro vided to the patient and the investigator 
is assured that the patient und erstands the implications of participating in the  study, the patient 
will be asked to give consent to p articipate in the  study by [CONTACT_10001]-approved consent 
form. 
 Data Management and Monitoring/Auditing 
Data will be captured in OnCore, Moffitt’s Clinical Trials Database. Regulatory documents and 
case report forms will be monitored internally according to Moffitt Cancer Center Monitoring 
Policies.   Monitoring will be performed regularly to verify data is accurate, complete, and 
MCC # [ZIP_CODE]

 verifiable from source documents; and the conduct of the trial is in compliance with the currently 
approved protocol/ amendments, Good Clinical Practice (GCP), and applicable regulatory 
requirements.  
 
 Adherence to the Protocol 
Except for an emergency situation in which prop er care for the protection, safety, and well-being 
of the study patient requires alternative treatment, the study shall be condu cted exactly as 
described in the approved protocol. 
 Emergency Modifications 
Moffitt Cancer Center and Affiliate investigators may implement a deviation from, or a change 
of, the pro tocol to eliminate an immediate hazard(s) to  trial subjects without prior H. Lee

12. Appendix  
APPENDIX  A: RECIST Criteria for Measuring Tumor Response Antitumor Effect  
 
Response  and progression  will be evaluated  in this study  using  the new international  criteria  
proposed  by [CONTACT_28637]  (RECIST)  guideline  
(version  1.1) (Eisenhauer  et al., 2009).  Changes  in the largest  diameter  (unidimensional  
measurement)  of the tumor  lesions  and the shortest  diameter  in the case of malignant  lymph  
nodes  are used in the  RECIST criteria.  
 
Definitions  
 
Evaluable  for toxicity.   All patients  will be evaluable  for toxicity  from  the time of their first 
treatment  with ramucirumab  or TAS [ADDRESS_117661] had their disease  re-evaluated  
MCC # [ADDRESS_117662]  their response  classified  
according  to the definitions  stated  below.  (Note:  Patients  who exhibit  objective  disease  
progression  prior to the end of  cycle 1 will also be considered  evaluable.)  
 
Disease Parameters  
 
Measurable  disease.   Measurable  lesions  are defined  as those  that can be accurately  measured  
in at least one dimension  (longest  diameter  to be recorded)  as ≥[ADDRESS_117663]  be recorded  in millimeters  (or 
decimal  fractions  of centimeters).  
 
Note:  Tumor  lesions  that are situated  in a previously  irradiated  area might  be considered  
measurable if the lesion  has increased  in size  since the radiation.  
 
Malignant lymph nodes . To be considered  pathologically  enlarged  and measurable,  a lymph  
node  must  be ≥[ADDRESS_117664] scan (CT scan slice thickness  
recommended  to be no greater  than 5 mm).  At baseline  and in follow -up, only the short  axis 
will be measured  and followed.  
 
Non-measurable disease . All other  lesions  (or sites of disease),  including  small  lesions  
(longest  diameter  <10 mm or pathological  lymph  nodes  with ≥10 to <15 mm short  axis),  are 
considered  non-measurable  disease.  Bone  lesions,  leptomeningeal  disease,  ascites,  
pleural/pericardial  effusions,  lymphangitis  cutis/pulmonitis,  and abdominal  masses  (not 
followed  by [CONTACT_462]),  are considered  as non-measurable.  
 
Target lesions.  All measurable  lesions  up to a maximum  of 2 lesions  per organ  and 5 lesions  
in total,  representative  of all involved  organs,  should  be identified  as target  lesions  and 
recorded  and measured  at baseline.  Target  lesions  should  be selected  on the basis  of their size 
(lesions  with the longest  diameter),  be representative  of all involved  organs,  but in addition  
should  be those  that lend themselves  to reproducible  repeated  measurements.  It may be the 
case that, on occasion,  the largest  lesion  does not lend itself  to reproducible  measurement  in 
which  circumstance  the next largest  lesion  which  can be measured  reproducibly  should  be 
selected.  A sum of the diameters  (longest  for non-nodal  lesions,  short  axis for nodal  lesions)  
for all target  lesions  will be calculated  and reported  as the baseline  sum diameters.  If lymph  
nodes  are to be included  in the sum,  then only the short  axis is added  into the sum.  The 
baseline  sum diameters  will be used as reference  to further  characterize  any objective  tumor  
regression  in the  measurable  dimension  of the disease.  
 
Non-target lesions . All other  lesions  (or sites of disease)  including  any measurable  lesions  
over and above  the 5 target  lesions  should  be identified  as non-target  lesions  and should  also 
be recorded  at baseline.  Measurements  of these  lesions  are not required,  but the presence,  
absence,  or in rare cases  unequivocal  progression  of each should  be noted  throughout  follow - 
up. 
 
Methods for Evaluation of Measurable Disease  
 
MCC # [ZIP_CODE]  
44 
Version 1.7  
 All measurements  should  be taken  and recorded  in metric  notation  using  a ruler or calipers.  
All baseline  evaluations  should  be performed  as closely  as possible  to the  beginning  of 
treatment  and never  more  than 4 weeks  before the beginning  of the treatment.  
 
The same  method  of assessment  and the same  technique  should  be used to characterize  each 
identified  and reported  lesion  at baseline  and during  follow -up. Imaging -based  evaluation  is 
preferred  to evaluation  by [CONTACT_105949](s)  being  followed  cannot  be 
imaged  but are assessable by [CONTACT_40133].  
 
Clinical lesions.  Clinical  lesions  will only be considered  measurable  when  they are 
superficial  (e.g., skin nodules  and palpable  lymph  nodes)  and ≥10 mm diameter  as assessed  
using  calipers  (e.g., skin nodules).  In the case of skin lesions,  documentation  by [CONTACT_105950],  including  a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion,  is recommended.  
 
Conventional CT and MRI . This guideline  has defined  measurability  of lesions  on CT scan 
based  on the assumption  that CT slice thickness  is [ADDRESS_117665] slice 
thickness  greater  than 5 mm, the minimum  size for a measurable  lesion  should  be twice  the 
slice thickness.  MRI  is also acceptable in certain  situations  (e.g., for body  scans).  
 
Use of MRI  remains  a complex  issue.  MRI has excellent  contrast,  spatial,  and temporal  
resolution;  however,  there  are many  image  acquisition  variables  involved  in MRI,  which  
greatly  impact  image  quality,  lesion  conspi[INVESTIGATOR_3934],  and measurement.  Furthermore,  the 
availability  of MRI  is variable  globally.  As with CT, if an MRI  is performed,  the technical  
specifications  of the scanning  sequences  used should  be optimized  for the evaluation  of the 
type and site of disease.  Furthermore,  as with CT, the modality  used at follow -up should  be 
the same  as was used at baseline  and the lesions  should  be measured/assessed  on the same  
pulse  sequence.  Ideally,  the same  type of scanner  should  be used and the image  acquisition  
protocol  should  be followed  as closely  as possible  to prior  scans.  Body  scans  should  be 
performed  with breath -hold scanning  techniques,  if possible.  
 
 
Response Criteria Evaluation of Target Lesions  
 
Complete Response (CR):  Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes 
(whether target or non -target) must have reduction in short axis to <10 mm.  
 
Partial Response (PR):  At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, 
taking as referenc e the baseline sum diameters.  
 
Progressive Disease (PD):  At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, 
taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the 
smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an 
absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also 
considered progression.)  
 
Stable Disease (SD):  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor su fficient increase to 
MCC # [ADDRESS_117666] sum diameters while on study.  
 
Evaluation of Non -Target Lesions  
 
Complete Response (CR):  Disappearance of all non -target lesions and normalization of tumor 
marker level. All lymph nodes must be non -pathological in size (<10 mm short axis).  
 
Non-CR/Non -PD: Persistence of one or more non -target lesion(s).  
 
Progressive Disease (PD):  Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal 
progression of existing non -target lesions. Unequivocal progression should not normally trump 
target lesion status. It must be representative of overall disease status change, not a single lesion 
increase.  
 
Although a clear progression of “non -target” lesions only is exceptional, the opi[INVESTIGATOR_12999], and the progression status should be 
confirmed at a later time by [CONTACT_079].  
 
Evaluation of Best Overall Response  
 
The best  overall  response  is the  best response recorded  from  the start of  the treatment  until 
disease progression/recurrence  (taking  as reference  for progressive disease  the smallest  
measurements  recorded  since  the treatment  started).  The patient's  best response  assignment  
will depend  on the  achievement  of both measurement  and confirmation  criteria.

PD Any Yes or No PD 
Any PD* Yes or No PD 
Any Any Yes PD 
*In exceptional  circumstances,  unequivocal  progression  in non-target  lesions may  be 
accepted  as disease  progression.  
 
Duration of Response  
 
Duration of overall response:   The duration of overall response is measured from the time 
measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that 
MCC # [ZIP_CODE]

Version 1.7  
 recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive 
disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  
 
The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met for CR 
until the first date that progressive disease is objectively documented.  
 
Duration of stable disease:  Stable disease is measured from the start of the treatment until the 
criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded since the 
treatment started, including the baseline measurements.  
 
Progression -Free Survival (PFS)  
 
PFS is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of progression o r death, 
whichever occurs firs t

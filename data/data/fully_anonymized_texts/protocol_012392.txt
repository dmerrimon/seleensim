family can be nefit and the patient can be supp orted in t heir effort to make lifesty le

Hypothesis and/or S pecific Aims or Objectives  
 
We hy pothesize t hat a culturally adapted DSME i mplemented in a family model 
will resu lt in be tter d iabetes m anagem ent outcomes  compared to traditional DSME 
for the M arshallese. 
 
In 
the fam ily delivery  mode l, a participant is encouraged to inv ite his/her fam ily 
members to th e diabetes e duca tional sessions. As ou tli ned by [CONTACT_489405], the 
mode l has several poten tial benefits. First, pa tients are empowered to invite the 
people t hey define as fam ily and as appr op riate for taking part in the s essions with 
them. Second, the education w ill engage th e patient-defined s upport unit. Third, given 
the high rate of diabe tes w ithin the c ommunity, it is highly probable t hat others within 
the g roup w ill have Type [ADDRESS_629135] a Fam ily Model of DSME using a mixed-met hods approach . 
Marshallese parti ci pants with type 2 di abetes wi ll be recru ited . Those who are assigned to 
the family model w ill be asked to invi te one to ten a dult mem bers of the ir families to 
participate in the DSME. Given t hat ~30-50% of adults in the Mars hallese co mmun ity 
have type [ADDRESS_629136] a com pa rative ef fectivene ss eva luation using a randomized c ontrol trial

cover the sam e  c oncep ts as the traditio nal format. However, the family model will 
incorporate culturally-adapted education and recommendations aimed at engaging family 
members in the management of the primary participant’s diabetes, and family members 
will be invited to fully participate in the study. By [CONTACT_489406], the t raditional mo del provides

intervention and implementa tion process. Participants will be offered a $ [ADDRESS_629138] as

debriefing session. 
 
Randomized p articipant assignme nt. Six cohorts will be recruited, approximately 
three months apart. Each cohort will be comprised of 75 participants with diabetes, with 
50% being assigned to the Family Model arm and 50% being assigned to the traditional 
DSME control group. The study sample size will be the total of each cohort; thus a total 
of 300 diabetics and up to 2000 family members (only those in the family model arm will 
be inviting family members) . We initially chose an unequal group design (70/30), but 
after assessing Cycle [ADDRESS_629139] sufficient 
control group numbers for analysis. Discussion with stakeholders resulted in support for 
this modification. Each participant will be randomly assigned to a group after consent. 
 
Randomization will occur at the family level rather than the individual level. Prior to 
randomization, consented participants will be grouped according to family unit to prevent 
two diabetics in the same family being randomly assigned to different groups, creating 
cross-contamination. Once an entire cohort is recruited and assigned a family identification 
number, each number (family) will be randomly assigned to a study arm. Randomization 
will be conducted utilizing the Excel random number generation function. Randomization 
will be conducted by [CONTACT_489407] f or recruitment con sent, or 
intervention delivery . Designated study staff will send the investigator a list of consented 
participants prior to the start of each new DSME cycle. The investigator will deliver t he 
study arm assignments to a designated study staff member at the project site. Participants 
will be notified of their group assignment at least one week prior to commencement of 
study activities.  
 
Study a rms description . The st andard ca re group will receive t raditional DSME in a 
group forma t. However, those in the standard group will attend classes with other un-
r
elated participants, unless two or more diabetics within the same family get assigned 
to the control group. The interv ention group will receive the adapted F amily Model of 
DSME in a family format, as described above. Participants in the Family Model will be 
encourag ed to invite one to ten family members to participate in the DSME sessions as 
w
ell as all other study events. 
 
Intervention:  Both the Family Model and the traditional DSME will include 10 h ours of 
content comprised of 8 modules. The classes will be delivered over a 6- 10 week period 
and each class will be approximately 75 minutes in length. To ensu re fidelity, the DSME

presentation about the study at churches after religious services. While this method of 
recruitment may seem unconventional, we have successfully used it to engage the 
Marshallese community, and our CBPR group believes it is the most culturally appropriate 
way to recruit.

materials as well as be available to discuss the study in more detail. If potential participants

All of the power and sa mple size c alcula tions and estimations were performed using 
PASS  2008 (NCSS, LLC. Kaysville, Utah.  www.ncss.com ). Our study design is a 
randomized two-g roup con stru ct with 4 r epeated time points (ba sel ine , post in tervention, 
6 months, and 12 months). So at its core, the st ud y is a two-factor desig n with repeated 
measures, which can be ex pa nded in to a general linear regression model, with main 
covariates being g roup assignment, ti me, their interaction, and adjustment for othe r 
covariates. The samp le sizes wil l achiev e 80% power to detect a medium ef fect of [ADDRESS_629150] is of the same magnitude as a study that repor ted appro ximately 0.5% ch ange in

3. Abstract: 
Background/Purpose: Approximately 15,[ADDRESS_723473] propulsion of the body’s c enter of mass is a cardinal 
feature of gait that depends on the generation of appropriate a nterior-posterior ground 
reaction forces. Decreased propulsive force generation by [CONTACT_941] p aretic limb of stroke 
survivors has been identified through both simulation and cross -sectional studies as a major 
contributor to walking d ysfunction. Extrinsic verbal  feedback from a therapi[INVESTIGATOR_550674]. However, this key 
component of gait is not directly observable by [CONTACT_2111][INVESTIGATOR_550675],  specifically deficits in 
somatosensation and proprioception, hindering recovery of paret ic propulsion and 
compromising walking function. T he objective of this study is t o provide preliminary 
evidence that biofeedback as an adjuvant to therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437]’ verbal feedback will improve 
propulsion and enhance walking function for Veterans post-strok e. 
Subjects: Thirty individuals > [ADDRESS_723474]-stroke will partic ipate. Additional study criteria 
include: 1) Ambulation of househ old distances without physical assistance to advance or 
support the paretic leg; 2) Unilateral leg paresis confirmed by  a score of < 32 on the Fugl-
Meyer Motor Assessment; 3) Step length asymmetry (paretic > non -paretic step length); 4) 
Ambulation without an assistive or orthotic device. 
Methods: Participants will be randomized to either an experimen tal group that will train with 
propulsion biofeedback from commercially available pressure-sen sitive insole sensors 
(Biofeedback group; n=15) or a control group that will train wi th standard therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]-provided 
verbal feedback alone (Standard group; n=15). The 12 session (3 X/week for 4 weeks) gait 
training intervention will be delivered by a physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541] -led team. For participants in the 
Biofeedback group, prior to the first intervention session, the  baseline amount of pressure 
exerted by [CONTACT_550691]. The insole area 
underlying the forefoot will then be calibrated to produce a to ne when pressure exceeds 5% 
of this baseline pressure. This  threshold will be progressively  increased at regular intervals 
throughout the intervention peri od to ensure participants are t raining at their challenge-point 
to improve propulsion of the par etic limb.  An insole of simila r thickness will be worn in the 
shoe of the non-paretic leg for symm etry and comfort but will n ot produce a tone during the 
intervention. Those in the Standard group will not wear insoles  during intervention but will 
receive verbal feedbac k alone regarding pr opulsion of the paret ic limb during gait training. 
Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]-provided verbal feedback will be used to instruct par ticipants on achieving and/or 
maintaining appropriate movement patterns that contribute to pr opulsion generation. For 
 Page [ADDRESS_723475] will choose from a standardized bank  of gait activities, suitable to 
each participant’s ability level. The goal for total walking ti me for each session will be 50 
minutes: 5, 10-minute bouts with a 2-minute rest between each b out. 
Outcome Measures: Paretic limb propulsion is our primary outcom e measure. Secondary 
measures include the Six Minute Walk Test, Functional Gait Asse ssment, Fall Self-Efficacy, 
temporal-distance gait measures and gait kinematics, and lower extremity strength 
measures, all of which will be measured pre- and post-intervent ion.  
Data Analysis Plan: Descriptive statistics will be provided for  all outcome measures. To 
identify the effect of the interv ention, differences between th e pre- and post-training 
assessment within each group (i.e. change scores) will be calcu lated. To test our 
hypotheses, we will apply independent sample t-tests to the cha nge scores of the 
Biofeedback and Standard group. Hypothesis testing will be cond ucted at a two-sided p < 
0.05 level.  
4.  Background: 
Improved walking ability is cons idered one of the most importan t outcomes of stroke 
rehabilitation1 with walking speed a widel y used measure of recovery2 and surrogate for 
functional walking ability.[ADDRESS_723476] propulsion of the body center of mass (COM) is a 
cardinal feature of normal, effi cient adult gait that depends o n the generation of 
appropriate anterior-posterior g round reaction forces (AP GRFs) . Decreased propulsive 
force generation by [CONTACT_550692] l imb of stroke survivors during  walking has been identified 
through both simulation and cros s-sectional stud ies as a major contributor to walking 
dysfunction.4-[ADDRESS_723477]-s troke revealed  that deficits 
in independent modulation of the quadriceps and plantarflexors resulted in decreased 
propulsion of the paretic com pared to the non paretic leg.12 Peterson and colleagues6 
further determined that hip ext ension angle was a significant p redictor and positively 
correlated with propul sive impulse of the pa retic leg. Given th at activity of the ankle 
plantarflexors and hip extension angle are primary contributors  to paretic propulsion,6 
Awad and colleagues implemented  a gait rehabilitation intervent ion consisting of 
Functional Electrical Stimulati on (FES) to the ankle plantarfle xors (to increase muscle 
activation) while participants am bulated at their maximum speed  (to facilitate  greater hip 
extension) on a treadmill with  overhead body-weight support [ADDRESS_723478]-intervention, 
improvements in paretic propulsi on were observed, demonstrating  the responsiveness of 
this impairment to reh abilitation. H owever, the modalities used  to achieve this 
improvement, FES and a treadmill  with a body-we ight support sys tem, are resources not 
 Page 4 of 13 
 available to many re habilitation clinics. A dditionally, this in tervention strategy required 2-3 
rehabilitation personn el to implement.  More  frequently in stro ke rehabilitation when these 
resources are not ava ilable, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_550676] a patient 
(with right hemiparesis for examp le) to “take a large step” (wi th the left leg to  increase hip 
extension of the paretic, righ t leg) or “push through to the fl oor” (with the right foot to 
increase plantarflexor activat ion). This type of feedback, with  attention focused on the 
patient’s movement, defined as “ internal-focus feedback” may no t be sufficient as patients 
post-stroke often lack intrinsic feedback me chanisms (i.e. decr eased proprioception, 
decreased somatosenation) to translate these verbal commands in to desired movements.  
Furthermore, the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_550677] e to objectively determine t he magnitude propulsion 
force generated by [CONTACT_102].  Therefore, this pi[INVESTIGATOR_550678] 
(external-focus feedback) as an adjuvant to therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]-provided (internal-focus) feedback 
to determine if this relatively simple and cost-e ffective inter vention strategy  will serve to 
increase paretic pr opulsion dur ing gait.   
Provision of feedback is a widel y known requisite for motor lea rning to occur.[ADDRESS_723479] secondary to CNS  damage. Intrinsic feedback me chanisms (i.e. 
proprioception, somatosensation), are crucial to motor skill le arning in healthy adults, but 
are either impaired or absent post-stroke .  Therefore, extrinsi c feedback from a therapi[INVESTIGATOR_550679] a cru cial alternative feedback sourc e in rehabilitation. 
 
How best to augment the pat ient’s own impair ed feedback mechani sms is a critical factor 
for rehabilitation scientists to determine in the development o f efficacious rehabilitation 
practices. A recent systematic review15 found that augmenting feedback through the use of 
biofeedback was superior to therapi[INVESTIGATOR_550680], wit h the effect being maintained beyond the intervention, 
indicating that learning had occurred. These previous results i n training muscle activity, joint 
position and limb posit ion provides the impe tus of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] s tudy to examine the use of 
biofeedback in the acquisition of paretic limb propulsion durin g gait.  
A systematic review on the use o f biofeedback  acr oss a variety  of lower limb activities 
following stroke determined that  biofeedback wit h an external-f ocus was superior to 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]-generated feedback.15 In this pi[INVESTIGATOR_550681] a prescribed  threshold of lo ading on the f orefoot during late stance 
is achieved (external-focus fee dback) will be tested as an adju vant to therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]-provided 
feedback. We hypothesize individu als who receive biofeedback in tervention as an 
adjuvant to therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]- provided feedback will  demonstrate improv ed paretic limb propulsion 
compared to those who receive th erapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]-provided feedback alone .    
As achievement of walk ing independence, no t necessarily the red uction in impairment, is 
often the standard for su ccessful rehabilitation16 and consequently the focus of 
rehabilitation services,[ADDRESS_723480] o f our two inter ventions on functional gait 
ability as determined by [CONTACT_7419]-distance walk ing ability, dynamic  balance and self-efficacy. 
5. Specific Aims: 
 
Specific Aim #1: Compare the e ffect of two interventions for im proving paretic limb 
propulsion in individuals with impaired, asymmetric gait post-s troke:  standard therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]-
provided verbal feedback (“verbal feedback group”) versus stand ard therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]-provided 
verbal feedback plus propulsion biofeedback (“biofeedback group ”). 
Hypothesis #1 : Improvement in paretic propulsi on during natural gait (i.e., tested without 
feedback) will be greater for the biofeedback group than for th e verbal feedback group. 
 
Specific Aim #2: Compare the e ffect of two interventions for im proving functional mobility in 
individuals with impaired, asymmetric gait post-stroke: standar d therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]-provided verbal 
feedback (“verbal feedback group”) versus standard therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]-pr ovided verbal feedback plus 
propulsion biofeedback (“biofeedback group”). 
Hypothesis #2:  Improvement in functional mobility will be greater for the bio feedback group 
than for the verbal feedback group, as measured by [CONTACT_245232]-Minu te Walk Test, Functional 
Gait Assessment and Modified Falls Self Efficacy Scale. 
6. Research Plan: 
This will be a prospective, singl e-blind, RCT enrolling individ uals at 6-months post-stroke. 
Consent for participa tion and enrollment will  occur in t wo part s: 1) Screening Consent and

 If 
following the medical record rev iew a potential participant rem ains eligible, they will be 
scheduled for an in-person screen  to determine if they meet the  criteria listed below.  
Potential participants will si gn the screening Informed Consent  Form and then the 
following screening assessm ents will be administered:  
 
1. Lower Extremity Fugl-Meyer Motor Assessment: The participant ’s ability to move 
their paretic lower limb will be assessed in  the supi[INVESTIGATOR_050], sittin g and standing 
position. 
2. Lower Extremity Fugl-Meyer S ensory Assessment: The participa nt’s ability to 
sense light touch and movement o f their paretic lower limb will  be assessed  in 
the supi[INVESTIGATOR_546807]. 
3. Observational Gait Assessment: Participant will walk a dista nce of [ADDRESS_723483] assessor will 
observe participant’s gait for asymmetry. 
4. Range of Motion:  Range of Mot ion of the hips, knees and ank les of both lower 
limbs will be assessed. This a ssessment will take place in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_481346]. 
5. Monofilament Testing: A monof ilament will be touched to the sole of the 
participant’s paretic foot and t hey will be queried if they can  feel the 
monofilament. 
Participants who meet eligibil ity criteria fo llowing the screen ing assessment will be 
invited to sign Part 2 Consent, t he Intervention Informed Conse nt Form. Intervention 
Informed Consent allows for base line testing and study particip ation.  
 Procedure.  Thirty individuals will be randomized to either the  Verbal Feedback Group  
(n=15) or the Biofeedback Group  (n=15) group. Participants in the Biofeedback Group  
 Page 7 of 13 
 will wear a commercially availabl e pressure-sensitive insole (P edar, Novel Electronics, 
Inc.) in the shoe on the paretic l ower extremity. Prior to the first intervention session, 
participants in the Biofeedback Group  will walk wearing the pre ssure-sensitive in-soles 
to determine the baseline amoun t of pressure exerted by [CONTACT_550694]-swing position. The i nsole area underlying the 
participant’s forefoot will be ca librated to produce a tone whe n pressure exceeds 5% of 
baseline. This threshold will be progressively increased at reg ular intervals throughout 
the intervention period to ens ure participants are gait trainin g at their challenge-point.  
An insole of similar thickness will be worn in the shoe of the non-paretic leg for 
symmetry and comfort but will no t produce a tone. Participants in the Verbal Feedback 
Group  will not wear insoles during intervention.  
Intervention. Intervention (12 , 60-minute sessions, 3X/week for  four weeks) will occur in 
an outpatient research setting . Participants will be supervised  by a licensed physical 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_550682] a gait belt dur ing all activities. The thera pi[INVESTIGATOR_550683] a 
standardized bank of gait activitie s, suitable to each particip ant’s ability level, such as: 
1) walking along a straight ind oor path, 2) negotiating obstacl es, 3) walking up and 
down inclined surfaces, and 4) wal king in a distracting environ ment. These varied 
environments will be utilized to a ssure participants continued engagement in the 
intervention. The goal for total walking time for each session will be 50 minutes: 5, 10-
minute bouts with a 2-minute re st between bouts. This is the ty pi[INVESTIGATOR_550684] d ischarged from inpatient 
rehabilitation. Biofeedback Group : Biofeedback (external-focus f eedback) will be provided as an 
adjuvant to therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]-provided fee dback during the intervention . Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_550685] “Verbal Feedbac k Group” section below. Partici pants will be instructed 
that a tone will sound when they “ push off with their (paretic)  leg to swing it forward” 
when the participant-specific pre-p rogrammed threshold is excee ded.  
Verbal Feedback Group : Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]-provided internal-foc us feedback (“directed towards  
components of body movement”
21) will be used to instruct participants on achieving 
and/or maintaining appropriate m ovement patterns that contribut e to propulsion 
generation.  Feedback will be custom ized for each participant, but will generally focus 
on 1) shifting body weight onto t he paretic side during stance 2) rolling over the front of 
the foot during late stance, 3) walking with symmetrical step l ength on both sides, 4) 
pushing off with the paretic l eg when steppi[INVESTIGATOR_550686].  If par ticipants are performing 
any/all of these movements we ll, feedback will be used to ackno wledge and encourage 
continuation of the ap propriate movements. 
 Outcome Measures.  Assessments will take place pre- and post-in tervention and 
conducted by a licensed physical  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541], blinded to group as signment.  
 
The primary outcome for Specific Aim #1 will be Paretic Limb Pr opulsion (PLP).  
 
Paretic Limb Propulsion (PLP). T he propulsive impulse will be d erived from the time 
integral of the positive A-P GRF for each leg.[ADDRESS_723484] equipped with embedded forc e platforms (Advanced Medica l Technology, 
Inc.). The force plates are flus h with the floor and are not an  obstacle or trippi[INVESTIGATOR_107783].   
 Page [ADDRESS_723485] ed and assessed to mo re explicitly describe 
participants’ gait. We will conduct explorat ory analyses on the se measures to guide 
formulation of future s tudies’ aims and hy potheses in this line  of research. Additional 
outcome measures will include:   1) Hip, knee and ankle  angle data from the LE’s will be acquire d using a modified Helen 
Hayes marker set with rigid clus ters on the pelvis and each thi gh, shank and foot 
segments and recording the move ment of these mar kers at 100 Hz using a 12 camera 
motion capture system (Vicon Moti on Capture Systems, Oxford, [LOCATION_006] ). Data will be 
processed us ing Visual 3D (C -Motion, Inc., Germa ntown, MD). We are particularly 
interested in hip extension angl e during late stance given its known contribution to 
forward propulsion.
6  
 2) Spatial-temporal gait variabl es of stride time, stride lengt h, step time, ste p length, step 
width and gait speed will be ca ptured while walking across a GA ITRite instrumented 
walkway (CIR Systems In c, Havertown, PA),  
 3) Surface EMG will be recorded from the soleus (SO) and medial  gastrocnemius (MG) of 
both legs because of their known  contribution to forward propul sion.

The primary outcome for Specific Aim #[ADDRESS_723486] (6MWT).[ADDRESS_723487]:  reflects a person’s ability to maintain a moderate amount of exertion 
over a period of time. It has been identified as an excellent m easure of poststroke walking 
capacity and commu nity ambulation23, [ADDRESS_723488] during the six 
minute time-frame as needed.  
 
Secondary Outcomes for Specific Aim #2 are:  
 Functional Gait Assessment (FGA),
[ADDRESS_723489] during 
which participants perform the foll owing activities: walk at no rmal speeds, at fast and 
slow speeds, with vertical and hor izontal head turns, with eyes  closed, over obstacles, 
in tandem, backward and while as cending and descending stairs. The FGA is a superior 
test of dynamic balance to other  oft-used clinical performance tests such as the 
Performance-Oriented Mobility A ssessment, the Berg Balance Scal e, and the Dynamic 
Gait Index all of which have repor ted ceiling effects in commun ity-living older adults.[ADDRESS_723490]-stroke. Additionally , a FGA cut-off score of 22/[ADDRESS_723491] propulsion would lead to improved dynami c balance and more 
stable gait, decreasing fall incidence. Modified Falls Efficacy Scale (MFES)
30 is a 14-item questionna ire based on the Falls 
Efficacy Scale (FES),[ADDRESS_723492] roke and is designed to 
measure self-perceived fear of  falling during task performance.  Significant differences in 
MFES scores between patients in  a Falls and Balance Clinic and healthy older adults (p 
< 0.05) attests to t he scales’ validity.30 Long-distance walking ability, dynamic balance 
during complex gait and falls sel f-efficacy will inform us rega rding if restitution of paretic 
limb propulsion during gait translate s into improvements in fun ction and improved 
quality of life. These results wil l inform the next study in th is line of research. 
Lower Extremity Strength Testi ng: Muscle strength of both limbs  will be assessed 
utilizing a hand- held dynamometer32. The dynamometer is plac ed between the hand of 
the assessor and the participant’s  limb, similar to a manual mu scle test, with the 
advantage of the dynamometer provi ding a quantified measurement  of force. 
Participants will be instructed to  contract their muscle and mo ve their limb against the 
dynamometer. Muscle st rength will be recorded. 
Videorecording. For participants who signed the video recording  consent, we will 
periodically videorecord traini ng sessions. This will allow the  intervention therapi[INVESTIGATOR_550687]’s training and strategize on how to progre ss the intervention. 
Videorecordings will also provi de the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_550688] w they can best assist 
the participant. Assessment sessions  will also be periodically recorded. This will provide 
assessment therapi[INVESTIGATOR_550689] t heir implementation of the a ssessments. 
Videorecordings may also be used  in scientific presentations. P articipants will be 
informed when videotapi[INVESTIGATOR_550690]. 
7. Possible Discomforts and Risks: 
The risks undertaken in the walki ng therapy programs of the stu dy are no greater than 
those in everyday physical ther apy clinics wher e persons who ha ve had a stroke are 
challenged daily to exercise, trai n, practice and improve beyon d their current abilities. 
Safety in therapy is mandatory. R esearch personnel will walk be side participants during 
all aspects of the exercise int ervention and all aspects of the  assessment that assess 
gait. Participants may experience some fatigue while being test ed or during the therapy 
sessions. Should they become tir ed, they will be allowed to res t. Participants may 
experience temporary muscle sor eness as they increase the use o f their trunk and limbs 
during the walking interventi on. There is a risk of falling dur ing walking activities, but 
guarding by [CONTACT_550695] l minimize the risk. Stroke p atients, including those in 
this study, are at risk for another stroke, coronary heart dise ase related event and 
cardiac related death, regar dless of intervention. 
8. Possible Benefits: 
Subjects participating in this s tudy may see improvements in th eir walking speed, 
balance, and/or the amount of walki ng that they are able to do.  They may become more 
confident in their balance  and walking ability.

Idera Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Confidential and Proprietary  1. SYNOPSIS  
1.1. Protocol Information  
Protocol Number  8400 -402 
Protocol Title  Phase 1/[ADDRESS_63609]  IMO -8400 for Injection, 150 mg  
Name [CONTACT_58443] -8400  
Phase of Development  1/2 
Indication (Target)  Relapsed or Refractory Diffuse Large B -cell Lymphoma (DLBCL)  
Number of Patients  Up to [ADDRESS_63610] V isit Q4 2017 
1.2. Objectives  
1.2.1.  Primary  Objective  
 To evaluate the safety and tolerability of escalating dose levels of IMO -8400 
administered by [CONTACT_6567] (SC) injection in patients with relapsed or refractory 
non-GCB subtype diffuse large B -cell lymphoma ( DLBCL ). 
1.2.2.  Secondary  Objectives  
 To assess the treatment effect (clinical activity ) in patients with non-GCB subtype  
DLBCL with myeloid differentiation primary response gene (88) ( MYD88 ) L265P 
mutations using disease -specific international guidelines for classifying  clinical 
response [1].  
 To identify an optimal dose of IMO -8400 for further clinical evaluation  in B-cell 
malignancies . 
 To characterize the pharmacokinetics of escalating dose levels of IMO -8400 
administered by [CONTACT_10530].  
1.2.3.  Exploratory Objectives  
 To investigate associations b etween the treatment effect of IMO -8400 and selected 
biomarkers (e.g., serum cytokines ). 
 To assess the potential immunogenicity of IMO -[ADDRESS_63611] of Toll -like receptors (TLR s) 7, [ADDRESS_63612]. Recent studies indicate a high 
frequency of mutation in MYD88  in patients with B -cell malignancies, particularly 
DLBCL  subtypes with poor prognosis [2]. Specifically, the gain -of-function L265P mutation is 
found in almost a third of DLBCL with the activated B -cell (ABC) phenotype. In vitro  studies of 
B-cell tumor lines indicate that (a) this mutation is associated with an increase in cell activation, 
proliferation, and survival [3], and (b) loss of endosomal TLRs results in markedly decreased cell 
proliferation and survival [4]. Data from Idera indicate that treatment of such cell lines with 
IMO -[ADDRESS_63613] [5].  
Recently reported clinical experience with IMO -8400 in patients with Wa ldenstr öm’s 
Macroglobulinemia (WM), a B -cell malignancy almost always driven by [CONTACT_58381]88 L265P 
mutation  [6], indicate that the treatment is active and we ll-tolerated at dose  level s up to 
1.2 mg/kg /twice weekly  [7]. Dose esc alation is continuing in that setting as the maximum 
tolerated dose ( MTD ) has not been reached.  
The current study represents the first clinical trial of IMO -8400 in patients with DLBCL.  
1.3.2.  Study Overview  
This is an open -label, multiple -dose, dose escalation study of IMO -8400 in patients with relapsed 
or refractory  DLBCL  of non-GCB subtype . The study is a Phase 1/[ADDRESS_63614] of a dose escalation to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D). Phase 2 is a 
Simon two-stage design [8], consisting of an open -label treatment of patients at the RP2D. 
Initially [ADDRESS_63615] two of the 10  patients respond, the 
study will enroll 19 more patients, for a total of 29 patients in the Phase  2 portion.  
A stu dy schematic is represented in Figure 1.

Idera Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Confidential and Proprietary  1.3.3.  Phase 1: Dose E scalation  
The dose escalation cohorts will  permit systematic evaluation of  the safety and tolerability of 
IMO -8400 at increasing dose levels in order to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD).  
 The planned dose escalation cohort levels for IMO -8400 are 0.3, 0.6, and 1.2 mg/kg  
administered twice weekly and 2.4 and 3.6 mg/kg administered once weekly 
(Table  3). Additional dose  level s, schedules , and route s of administration  may be 
evaluate d based upon the emerging data.  Dosing is based on body weight 
(Section  8.1). Doses will be administered by [CONTACT_10530].  
 The Investigators and Sponsor will review available toxicity information (including 
adverse events  [AEs]  that are not dose-limiting toxicities [DLTs] ), pharmacokinetic 
(PK) and activity data to determine  the MTD  (Section  1.3.5 ). 
Table  3: Planned Dose Escalation Cohorts  
Dose Level  IMO -8400 Dose (mg/kg)  Frequency  Initial Cohort Size  
1 (starting dose)  0.3 Twice W eekly  3-6 
2 0.6  Twice W eekly  3-6 
3 1.2 Twice W eekly  3-6 
4 2.4 Weekly  3-6 
5 3.6 Weekly  3-6 
Procedures for patient safety are summarized below and presented in detail in the sections 
indicated:  
 Explicit definitions for identifying suspected adverse reactions as DLT  events 
(Section  6.3.1 ). 
 All injections of study medication will be administered by [CONTACT_21724]. Patients 
will be observed for [ADDRESS_63616] 30 minutes 
following all other treatments (Section 8.4).  
 Detailed provisions for management of study drug in individual patients based on 
safety, tolerabi lity, and disease response ( Section 6.5).  
 Constitution of a Cohort Review Committee (CRC) comprised of the Idera Medical 
Monitor and Investigators from participating sites to decide whether to continue or 
halt dose escalation, or explore intermediate dose levels (Section 6.3.2 ).  
1.3.4.  Phase 2: Dose Expansion Cohort  
Once the RP2D  has been established, additional patients will be treated in a dose expansion 
phase that is designed to better characterize the safety, tolerability and preliminary anti -tumor 
activity of the study drug when provided at the RP2D  to patients with non-GCB s ubtype  DLBCL 
with MYD88 L265P mutations . Phase 2 utilizes a Simon two-stage design  [8], consisting of an 
open -label trea tment of patients at the RP 2D. Initially [ADDRESS_63617] three  patients, with a maximum of 
six patients . The number of patients enrolled in any of the planned dose esc alation cohorts can be 
reduced if safety at that dose  level  has already been demonstrated in a related population 
(e.g., WM).  
 If the initial three patients complete all [ADDRESS_63618] a dose esc alation review.  
 If one of the initial three patients experiences a DLT event prior to completing 
Cycle  1, then enrollment at that dose level will continue to a total of six patients and 
the dose escalation review will be done when all six patients have completed Cycle 1.  
 If two patients at a dose -level experience DLT events during the Cycle 1, then no 
further patients will be enrolled until the CRC completes a review, which should be 
done as soon as feasible .  
 Furthermore, cohorts may be expanded to include additional patients if such patients 
can be enrolled ≤[ADDRESS_63619] (or sixth) patient was first dosed with 
IMO -8400.  
The CRC review will include all available safety data . To facilitate standardi zing the dose 
escalation reviews across different cohorts, the focus will be on observations from Cycle 1 at that 
dose level.  
The following represent anticipated o utcomes for the review process:  
 Appro val of enrollment in the e xpansion cohort  at that dose l evel, if applicable .  
 Dose esc alation – progression to the next planned dose level.  
 Continue cohort enrollment (applicable only to review after three patients) – enroll up 
to six patients at the current dose level to obtain additional safety data for subs equent 
review.  
 Increase the number of patients treated at a given pre -specified or intermediary dose 
level to better define the safety profile of IMO -[ADDRESS_63620] patient in a cohort completes Cycle 1.  
 Dose de -escalation – enrollment of an intermediate  level contingency cohort  to 
facilitate identifying the MTD .  
 No further dose esc alation enrollment – at this time the CRC will indicate the dose 
level they consider represents the MTD.  
The CRC comprises experienced clinicians, who will make recommendations based on their 
judgment. In consideration of the dynamic nature of early phase  studies, those recommendations 
may include alternative courses of action not anticipated here.

Idera Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Confidential and Proprietary  1.3.6.  Management of Study Treatment in Individual Patients  
Each enrolled patient will receive IMO -8400 at the assigned dose level until disease progression , 
intolerab le toxicity (despi[INVESTIGATOR_58341]), withdrawal of consent, start of another 
anti-cancer therapy, or study completion , whichever occurs first .   
For DLT  events, provision is made for pausing treatment for up to 3 weeks and, if the acute 
toxicity improv es sufficiently, resuming tr eatment at a lower dose level ( Section 6.5.2 ). Patients 
who are tolerating treatment at dose levels below those deemed a cceptable by [CONTACT_58382].  
1.4. Study Structure  
 Pre-screening of patients who are deemed to be at high risk of recurrence can be 
performed by [CONTACT_58383]88 L265P  mutation at any point dur ing the course 
of their disease . This would allow patients rapid access to study participation if they 
relapse or are refractory to standard therapy, without the delay associated with 
mutation testing.  
 Screening will be done within 21 days prior to Cycle 1, Day 1 (the first treatment 
with study drug). See Section 9.2 for details of Screening  and Section 9.4 for details 
of the enrollment process.  
 Treatment is scheduled to be administered until disease progression, intolerable 
toxicity (despit e dose modification), withdrawal of consent, start of another 
anti-cancer therapy, or study completion, whichever occurs first.  
 Assessment for treatment response will continue throughout the patient’s 
participation or until disease progression . 
 End-of-Treatment (EOT) visit will be performed within 7 days of the decision to 
terminate treatment .  
 End-of-Study (EOS) visit will be performed [ADDRESS_63621] severe and progressive illness. Both 
Investigator s and patients want to avoid delaying treatment for even the 7 to 10 days required for 
testing for the presence of the MYD88 L265P  mutation, which is associat ed with poor prognosis, 
and increased risk for disease progression and death  [9]. Available data indicate that the mutation 
is present at diagnosis and its impact on outcome can persist through current standard of care 
treatment [10]. 
Therefore, if a result  for the MYD88  L256P mutation has already been identified using  a Clinical 
Laboratory Improvement Amendments ( CLIA )-compliant assay , then this result can be used for 
eligibility purposes so that the patient can continue additional screening procedures. Every 
IMO -[ADDRESS_63622] meet all of the following criteria:  
1. Have a primary diagnosis of DLBCL of non-GCB subtype , established according to the 
World Health Organization (WHO) criteria  [11]. 
2. Be at least [ADDRESS_63623] Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status ≤ 2.

 Platelets ≥50,000/μL  
 Serum creatinine ≤2.5x Upper limit of normal ( ULN ) 
 Serum aspartate transaminase (AST) ≤2.5x ULN  
 Serum alanine transaminase (ALT) ≤2.5x ULN  
 Total bilirubin ≤1.5x ULN  
 Prothrombin time (PT) ≤1.5x ULN  
6. Have no history or curre nt clinical evidence of lymphoma involvement in the central 
nervous system ( CNS ). 
7. Have received at least one course of therapy consistent with the recommendations  of the  
National Comprehensive Cancer Network [10]. 
8. Have either (a) received an autologous stem cell transplant, or (b) been assessed as 
ineligible for the procedure, or (c) declined the procedure.  
9. Have relapsed or progressed (“refractory”)  based on the criteria for assessing response 
from the International Harmonization Project  [1] (Section 9.6).  
10. Have tumor tissue that tests positive for a MYD88 mutation  using a 
CLIA -compliant assay . (Note: patients whose tumors do not harbor MYD88  L265 P 
mutations are eligible for the dose escalation phase of the study .) 
11.  For women of childbearing potential and men, agree to use  effective contraceptive 
methods from Screening , through  the study , and for at least [ADDRESS_63624] dose of 
study drug . Effective birth control (contraception) m ethods are defined as one of the

IMO -8400 administered  as follows:  
 Dose levels of 0.6 to 3.6 mg/kg/w eek by [CONTACT_58384]  (Section 8.4).  
 Injection volume not to exceed 1.2 mL/site, with multiple sites used per dose as 
necessary.  
IMO -8400  Page 13 of 91 
Protocol 8400 -402, Version 4.0 29 Jan 2016  
 
Idera Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Confidential and Proprietary   Dose to be recalculated if change in body weight from Screening  exceeds 10% ( ±). 
 Injectio ns will be administered in the four quadrants of the abdomen or in the upper 
thigh s, rotating injection site (s) each time IMO -8400 is administered  (Section 8.4).  
1.6.2.  Reference Therapy, Dosage and Mode of Administration  
Not applicable.  
1.7. Criteria for Evaluation  
1.7.1.  Pharmacokinetics  
Pharmacokinetic  samples will be obtained as scheduled in relation to the first dose administered 
at each of Cycle s 1, 2, 4, and 6 ( Day 1  of each cycle) . The following PK samples will be 
collected:  pre-dose, at 1 ( ±5 minutes), 2 (± 10 minutes), and 4 (± 15 minutes) hours post -dose. 
Pharmacokinetic  samples will also be taken at the EOT and EOS visits. Plasma samples will be 
analyzed for IMO -8400 concentration using a validated  bioanalytical method.   
For each cohort, the plasma IMO -8400 concentration data will be analyzed by 
[CONTACT_105]-compartmental PK analysis. The  following parameters will be determined as appropriate: 
observed maximum plasma concentration (C max), time of C max (Tmax), and area under the curve  
from [ADDRESS_63628] measurable plasma concentration (AUC 0-t).  Pharmacokinetic parameters will be 
compared acros s IMO -8400 dose levels.  
1.7.2.  Safety  
Assessments for safety include:  
 Ongoing monitoring for clinical AEs and concomitant medications .  
 Symptom review and vital signs at each scheduled visit.  
 Physical exam and electrocardiogram (ECG)  (Section 9.7). 
 Laboratory safety tests  (hematology, serum complement, clinical chemistry , 
coagulation , urinalysis) (Section 9.8). 
 Injection site reactions ( ISRs) (Section  9.7.5 ). 
 Additional unscheduled assessments at Investigator’s discretion.  
1.7.3.  Treatment Effect  
A limited physical examination will be performed at every cycle focusing on known sites of 
disease. Assessm ents of disease status by [CONTACT_58385] -8400  will be conducted every 8 week s or as indicated based on new signs, symptoms or 
laboratory findings. During follow up ( Section  6.5.6 ), patients discontinued from treatment  for 
reasons other than progressive disease  will be as sessed per Revised Response Criteria for 
Lymphoma ( Section 16.2) at a minimum of every 12  weeks for overall survival (OS) until 
documentation of progressive disease , initiation of new anti-cancer therapy , or the end of the 
study , whichever comes first. Following disease progression during survival follow up, patients 
IMO -[ADDRESS_63629] [1] (Section 9.6). Time to progression and duration of 
response  will be measured as defined ( Section  12.4).  
1.8. Statistical Methods  
Analysis Populations : 
 DLT Evaluable Population: patients enrolled in the Phase 1 dose esca lation portion of 
the study who  receive all planned doses of study drug during the DLT observation 
period or who discontinue treatment due to AEs. 
 Safety/ Intent -to-Treat (ITT) Population: all patients who received at least 
one injection of study drug. 
 Efficacy Evaluable (EE) Population: all patients who are MYD88 L265 P mutati on 
positive  and have been treated at the RP2D . 
 Per Protocol (PP) Population: all patients in the EE who had no major protocol 
violations that would potenti ally influence treatment effect.  
 Pharmacokinetic (PK) Population: all patients who had both a pre -dose and at least 
one analyzable post -dose PK sample.  
CRC review will be performed on the DLT Evaluable Population for the dose being considered. 
Safety analyses will be performed using the Safety/ITT Population . Efficacy endpoints  (analysis 
of treatment effe ct [Section  12.4]) will be analyzed for the EE and PP Populations. Response will 
also be tabulated for the Safety/ITT Population.  Pharmacodynamic  and immunogenicity 
assessments will be analyzed for the Safety/ITT  Population . Pharmacokinetic  results will be 
analyzed by [CONTACT_105] -compartmental PK analysis. Descriptive statistics will be provided for all PK 
parameter values by [CONTACT_58386], as appropriate . 
Primary Safety and Tolerability Endpoints : 
 Number of DLTs  
 Frequency and intensity of AEs  
 Physical examination findings, including vital signs  
 Laboratory safety tests including hematology, chemistry, coagulation , urinalysis  and 
complement levels  
 Assessment  of ISRs  
 ECG findings  
Primary Efficacy Endpoint : 
 Proportion of responders at the RP2D  with the MY D88 L265 mutation  
Secondary Efficacy Endpoints : 
 Duration of response

Idera Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Confidential and Proprietary   Time to response  
 Proportion of responders at all dose levels  
 OS 
 Progression -free survival  
Safety Analyses  
Adverse events will be coded using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) 
version 16.0  and tabulated by [CONTACT_15992], grade, and relationship to study treatment. Safety analyses 
will be descriptive in nature; no statistical hypothes is testing will be performed . Laboratory 
assessments for hematology, chemistry, coagulation, and special safety tests (C3, C4, and CH50) 
will be tabulate d via shift tables, tabulating each patient’s category at baseline via National 
Cancer Institute -Common  Terminology Criteria for Adve rse Events (NCI -CTCAE), 
version  4.03 grading (normal and Grade 1 will be combined) versus their highest NCI-CTCAE 
grade on study.  Injection site reactions will be summarized by [CONTACT_58387]. Time -to-event analyses will be performed for ISRs.  
Efficacy Analyses  
The definition of a respon der is a patient who achieves a complete response ( CR) or partial 
response ( PR) based on the Revised Response Criteria for Malignant Lympho ma proposed by 
[CONTACT_37404] [1] (Section 9.6 and Section 16.2).  
As per the Simon two-stage design, after [ADDRESS_63630] s respond, the study will end. If 
two or more of those initial 10 subjects respond, 19 m ore subjects will be enrolled. If six or more 
subjects out of 29 treated at the RP2D respond, then the null hypothesis will be rejected.  
Secondary  efficacy endpoints include  the duration of response,  time to response, proportion of 
responders at all dose levels, OS, and progression -free survival; these will be analyzed both 
globally across all cohorts and by [CONTACT_15994], reporting Kaplan -Meier estimated median, as well 
as the number of events and numbe r of patients censored.

Idera Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Confidential and Proprietary  4. INTRODUCTION  
4.1. Diffu se Large B -cell Lymphoma : the Disease under Study  
Hematological malignancies  are cancers  affecting  blood,  bone marrow, and  lymph nodes; they 
may derive from either myeloid or lymphoid cell lines. Those arising from the lymphoid line 
may originate from lymphatic tissue within the bone marrow or outside it, including lymph 
nodes or lymphatic structures in the skin, gastrointestinal tract or other body sites ( Table 6). 
Lymphoid tumors arising outside the bone marrow may spread to t he marrow and impair the 
production of hematopoietic cells, resulting in pancytopenia.

1. Lymphoid malignancies arising in the marrow are also referred to as “precursor cell neoplasms” and those arising outside 
the ma rrow as “mature cell neoplasms.”   
2. Sites of origin outside the bone marrow include lymph nodes or lymphatic structures in the skin, gastrointestinal tract , and 
other body sites . 
Non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL) represent a heterogenous grou p of lymphoid malignancies . The 
primary differentiation is based on lymphocyte cell type: B -cell, T -cell, NK -cell. The complete 
World Health Organization ( WHO ) classification currently inc ludes over 30 specific mature 
B-cell neoplasms [11] (Section  16.1) distinguished by [CONTACT_58388] , including:  
 Histologic appearance, e.g., follicular, mantle cell, diffuse large B -cell 
 Tissue or structure of origin or primary involvement: spleen, mucosa -associated 
lymphoid tissue (MALT), marginal zone, mediastinum (thymus), skin  (cutaneous), 
intravascular  
 Immunoglobulin production: Waldenström ’s Macroglobulinemia  (WM)  
(immunoglobulin [ Ig]M), multiple myeloma (IgG, IgA) , heavy chain diseases  
 Associated  virus, e.g., Epstein -Barr virus ( EBV ), human herpesvirus 8 ( HHV -8), 
Human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV) 
Current estimates for the [LOCATION_002] are approximately 70,000 new cases of NHL annually 
and 19,000 deaths [12]. The incidence of NHL rises steadily with advancing age from rates of 
2.4 cases per 100,000 in the 20 - to 24 -year age-group, to 8 cases per 100,000 for 35 - to

Idera Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Confidential and Proprietary  39-year-olds, to 119.4 cases per 100,000 among those age 80 - to 84 -years. The median age at 
diagnosis is ~70 years old.   
Among the cases of NHL, ~85% arise from B -cells and the most common of the mature B -cell 
malignancies is diffuse large B -cell lymphoma ( DLBCL ), representing ~31% of all NHL. Some 
rare forms of diffuse large B -cell tumors are recognized as specific diagnoses, including:  
 DLBCL associated with chronic inflammation  
 Primary cutaneous DLBCL, leg typ e  
 Intravascular large B -cell lymphoma  
 Primary DLBCL of the central nervous system ( CNS ) 
 T-cell/histiocyte rich large B -cell lymphoma  
 Primary mediastinal (thymic) large B -cell lymphoma  
 EBV -positive DLBCL of the elderly  
 Large B -cell lymphoma arising in HHV8 -associated multicentric Castleman  disease  
Recent molecular analyses have proposed subtypi[INVESTIGATOR_58345] a ctivated B -cell subtype ( [ABC ]; representing ~2 8% of DLBCL s) 
and germinal center B-cell (GCB) subtype (representing most of the remaining DBLCL s)[13]. 
Germinal center B-cell subtype -DLBCL has been associated with a higher  response rate to 
standard treatments and an overall improved  prognosis , with 60% five -year survival, compared 
to 39% for pati ents with non -GCB tumor profiles  [13]. The ABC phenotype, which is driven by 
[CONTACT_58389] (88) ( MYD88 ) mutation in a significant 
proportion of patients ( Table  7), has a particularly poor prognosis when compared with GCB  
subtype -DLBCL, and thus represents an important unmet medical need [14]. 
4.1.1.  Current Standard of Care Therapy  for NHL  
Treatment strategies in NHL vary depending on the specific disease and stage. Diffuse large 
B-cell lymphoma is considered an aggressive lymphoma with the potential for rapid disease 
progression. I ntensive chemotherapy is typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] t he initial treatment of c hoice ; rituximab (an 
anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody) plus combination cytotoxic chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, 
doxorubic in, vincristine, and prednisone [ R-CHOP ]) represents the most commonly used 
regimen . 
Options for treating relapsed or refractory disease  include : 
 Bone marrow or stem cell transplantation  
 Repeat of initial therapy  
 Other combinations of rituximab and chemotherapy  
 Radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies  
 Immunomodulatory drugs (e.g. , lenalidomide)   
IMO -[ADDRESS_63646] improved p rogression -free survival for patients with 
relapsed/refractory NHL, but definitive survival advantage is less clear and most patients die 
from the disease. New treatments are n eeded for advanced, recurrent B -cell malignancies and 
current practice guideline s recommend inclusion of these patients in  investigational trials [10]. 
4.2. Toll-like Receptors  – Overview  
Toll-like receptors (T LRs) are a family of host sensors for “foreign” constituents (e.g., nucleic 
acids, lipopolysaccharides, peptidoglycans  from viruses, ba cteria, fungi ) that “sound the alarm” 
and activate host immune defenses. The natural ligands for TLR7  and 8  are single -stranded 
ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) from viruses , and for TLR9, unmethylated cytosine -guanine dinucleotide 
motifs (CpG), which are characteri stic of bacterial deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ). Binding of 
these ligands to the cognate receptor results in intracellular signaling, generation of nuclear 
factor kappa -light-chain -enhancer of activated B -cells ( NF-κB), and production of 
pro-inflammatory (Th 1) chemokines and cytokines, including interferon (IFN )-α, tumor necrosis 
factor (TNF -α) and interleukin ( IL)-12. Of note, TLRs 7, 8, and [ADDRESS_63647] cell surface. In man, the endosomal TLR s are 
constitutively expressed primarily on dendritic cells (DCs) and B-cells. 
Although foreign constituents are the intended ligands for the nucleic acid TLRs, multiple  
studies indicate that activation by [CONTACT_58390]  [15, 16, 17, 18, 19]. As detailed below, 
recent evidence suggests this process can also contribute to the malignant phenotype of B -cell 
tumors.  
The TLR signaling pathway (Figure 2, left panel) comprises a series of cytoplasmic proteins that 
result in generation of NF -κB, which translocates to the nucleus and mediates increased 
expression of genes involved in cell survival , proliferation , and cytokine production . In B-cells, 
the other major mechanism for activatio n is binding of specific antigen to the B-cell receptor 
(BCR). There are several signaling pathways associate d with the BCR (Figure 2, right panel), 
including one that generates increased NF -κB. The constituents of th at BCR  signaling pathway 
are, in general, distinct from those of the TLR pathway .

4.3. Toll-like Receptors  in B-cell Malignancy  
A central feature of malignant cell transformation is the development of dysregulated or 
autonomous cell activation resulting in increased cell proliferation and survival. This can be the 
result of specific ‘oncogene’ mutations or defects in the control of  the expression of critical 
genes. Chromosomal abnormali ties, both point mutations and  translocations , are common among 
hematological malignancies, have an established role in diagnosis, and are increasingly used in 
guiding specific approaches to treatment.  
Studies of B-cell malignancies have identified changes in the BCR  signaling pathway, and more 
recent ly in the TLR signaling pathway, that drive NF -κB expression and the malignant 
phenotype. These changes include:  
 Mutations in MYD88 , the adapter (linker) protein that binds to TLRs [20]. 
 Mutations in BCR signaling pathway genes, including CD79A/B and CARD1 1 [3]. 
 Increased expression of MYD88  [21]. 
The most common alter ation identified to date in MYD88  is the L265P mutation. This mutation 
is present in over 90% of WM, in ~30% of ABC -DLBCL , and at lower frequencies in other, 
more common lymphomas  (Table  7). Among patients with D LBCL, both increased expression of 
MYD88  [21] and the L265P mutation [9] have been associated with markedly poorer outcomes.

the SEER [28], and the relative counts of specific diagnoses within the dataset.  
2. Estimated incidence of L265P mutation is based on 2011 disease incidence and the reported frequency of the mutation in the 
disease.  
3. ABC -type represents ~28% of all DLBCL. In studies subt ypi[INVESTIGATOR_58347], most instances of L265P mutations have been in 
those with ABC -subtype.  
4. Marginal Zone Lymphoma is also referred to as  MALT . 
Recent in vitro  studies of B-cell tumor lines with L265P mutation suggest that TLR signaling 
directly contributes to th e malignant phenotype of these cells [4]. Specifically, cell proliferation 
and survival decreased markedly under the following conditions:  
 Impaired  expression of endosomal TLRs, using a n inhibitory RNA . 
 Enzymatic elimination of endogenous nucleic acids in the culture supernatant . 
Idera  Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  has conducted independent studies using B-cell tumor lines , 
including  LY10, a cell line with the L265P mutation  and increased MYD88  expression . 
LY10  cells cultured in vitro  with IMO -8400 demonstrate  decreased growth and surv ival. Severe 
combined immunodeficient ( SCID ) mice inoculated with LY10 developed progressive disease 
and died. Treatment with IMO -8400 prolonged median survival from 33 to 48 days [5].  
4.4. Rationale for the Current Study  
Taken together, the above data  directly support the hypothesis that an antagonist of TLR7, 8, and 
[ADDRESS_63648] for TLRs 7, 8, and 9 and 
blocks cell activation mediated through ligand binding . In human studies, IMO -8400 has been 
administered once weekly by [CONTACT_6567] ( SC) injection in two complete d clinical trials, 
including a 4 -week Phase 1 study of healthy adults administered 0.3 or 0.6  mg/kg  
(Study  8400 -001) and a 12 -week Phase 2a study of patients with moderate to severe plaque 
psoriasis administered 0.075, 0.15, 0.3, or 0.6  mg/kg (Study 8400 -201). All treatments were 
well-tolerated. There were no deaths, serious adverse events ( SAEs ), discontinuations due to 
IMO -8400   Page 36 of 91 
Protocol 8400 -402, Version 4.0 29 Jan 2016  
 
Idera Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Confidential and Proprietary  treatment -related adverse events (TEAEs), and no clinically meaningful changes in laboratory 
measurements, 12 -lead electrocardiograms ( ECG s), or physical examination findings in either 
study.  
IMO -8400 is also currently being evaluated in an ongoing, open -label study at weekly dose  
level s of 0.6  mg/kg/week , 1.2 mg/kg/week , or 2.4  mg/kg/week  (1.2 mg/kg  twice weekly)  in 
patients with WM ( Study  8400 -401) as well as in an extension study for patients completing 
Study 8400 -401 (Study 8400 -404) (see Section  4.4.1  and Investigator Brochu re [IB]  for study 
details).  Recently repo rted interim results from Study  8400 -401 show that IMO -8400 is 
well-tolerated and demonstrate evidence of clinical activity [7]. Dose esc alation  is ongoing in 
this study as a maximum tolerated dose ( MTD ) has not been reached.  
The current study represents the first use of IMO -[ADDRESS_63649] for endosomal TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9. N on-clinical studies (reviewed in de tail in 
the IB) demonstrated that IMO -8400  has the  following characteristics:  
 Acts as an antagonist for activation of TLR7,  8 and 9, specifically blocking the 
activity of agonists for those receptors, including inhibiting generation of NF-κB and 
induction  of cytokine s and chemokine s (e.g., TNF -α, IL -12, IL -1β, 
interferon  inducible protein 10 [ IP-10], IL-6, IFN -α). 
 Has no agonist activity; that is, does not induce Th1 cytokines/chemokines.  
 Is specific for endosomal TLRs 7, 8, and 9; that is, has no effect on activation of other 
unrelated TLRs, such as TLR4, whose natural ligand is bacterial 
lipopolysaccharide  (LPS).  
 Has potent therapeutic activity in animal models of autoimmune diseases to inhibit 
the progression or reverse the clinical and immunologic manifestations of disease . 
Further , Idera has recently completed studies both in vitro  and in mice examining  the effect of 
IMO -[ADDRESS_63650]. These studies demonstrate that IMO -8400 has the following effects:  
 Inhibit s constitutive  activ ation of  cell signaling pathways, including NF -κB, 
interleukin receptor activated kinase ( IRAK ), signal transducer and activator of 
transcription ( STAT )-3, Janus kinase ( Jak)/STAT , and Bruton's tyrosine kinase 
(BTK ), in human lymphoma cell lines with the MYD88 L265P  mutation.  
 Decreases in vitro  cell survival and proliferati on in a time - and 
concentration -dependent manner in human lymphoma cell lines with the 
MYD88  L265P  mutation.  
 Decreases tumor cell growth in vivo , as indicated by [CONTACT_58391] -secreted human cytokine  and increase d mouse survival time in a disseminated

6.1. Overall Study Design  
This is an open -label, multiple -dose, dose esc alation study of IMO -8400 in patients with relapsed 
or refractory DLBCL  of non-GCB subtype . The study is a Phase 1/[ADDRESS_63651] of a dose escalation to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D). Phase 2 is a 
Simon two-stage design [8], consisting of an open -label treatment of patients at the RP2D. 
Initially [ADDRESS_63652] two of the 10  patients respond, the 
study will enroll 19 more patients, for a total of 29 patients in t he Phase  2 portion.  
A study schematic is represented in Figure 3. 
Figure 3: Study Schematic  
 
6.2. Phase 1: Dose Esc alation  
The dose esc alation cohorts will systematically evaluate the safety and tolerability of IMO -8400 
at increasing dose levels in order to ident ify the MTD .  
 The planned dose escalation cohort levels for IMO -8400 are 0.3, 0.6, and 1.2  mg/kg 
administered twice week ly and 2.4 and 3.6 mg/kg administered once weekly 
(Table  3). Additional dose  level s, schedules , and routes of administration  may be 
evaluate d based up on the emerging data.  Dosing is based on body weight 
(Section  8.1). Doses will be administered by [CONTACT_10530].  
 The Investigators and Sponsor will review available toxicity information (including 
AEs that are not dose-limiting toxicities  [DLTs ]), pharmacoki netic ( PK) and activity 
data to determine  the MTD  (Section  6.3.3 ).

Idera Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Confidential and Proprietary  6.3. Dose E scalation Procedures  
6.3.1.  Definition of a Dose -Limiting Toxicity  
The safety and tolerability of IMO -8400 will be assessed using reported and observed AEs as 
well as scheduled safety observations including vital signs, physical examination, laboratory 
safety tests (hematology, serum complement, chemistry, and coagulation), urinalysis, and ECGs .  
A DLT can be either a clinical or laboratory AE. 
A potential DLT event is defined as a TEAE  (Section 10.1) that meets protocol -defined  criteria  
for events of hematological and non -hematological origin.  It must be related to study treatment 
(assessed as not related to disease, intercurrent illness , or concomitant medication).  For the 
purposes of dose escalation and determination of the MTD, only DLTs that occur during the first 
cycle of treatment will be necessarily considered for discussions regarding dose escalation.  
Clinically significant toxicities or TEAEs  that meet the definition of dose limiting but occur after 
Cycle 1 (dose modifying events) may be considered when determining the RP2D . 
Protocol -defined hemat ologic DLT criteria : 
 Grade 4 neutropenia  lasting  ≥ 7 days  
 Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia with fever ≥38.5 °C 
 Grade 3 thrombocytopenia with bleeding  that requires transfusion therapy  
 Grade 4 thrombocytopenia  
Protocol -defined non -hematologic DLT  criteria : 
 Grade 3 vomiting or nausea despi[INVESTIGATOR_58348] -emetic treatments  
 Grade 3 diarrhea despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] t he use of optimal anti -diarrheal treatments  
 Serum creatinine ≥ 3.0 x upper limit of normal ( ULN ) 
 Bilirubin ≥ 3.[ADDRESS_63653]  
 Bilirubin 2.[ADDRESS_63654] with ≥ Grade 2 ALT in patients  without liver metastases  
 Bilirubin 2.[ADDRESS_63655] with ≥ Grad e 3 ALT or ALT > [ADDRESS_63656] in  patients with liver 
metastases  
 Other non -hematologic toxicities of ≥ Grade 3 except for the following:  
 AEs related to underlying disease  
 Fatigue  
 Alopecia  
 Isolated, asymptomatic elevations in biochemistry laboratory values lasting  ≤7 
days. This includes el ectrolyte abnormalities that respond to medical intervention.

Protocol 8400 -402, Version 4.0 29 Jan 2016  
 
Idera Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Confidential and Proprietary  The Cohort Review Committee ( CRC ) will review all DLTs to assess causality, i.e. , relationship 
to study drug  (Section  10.4.3 ).The definition of DLT event will be applicable in the following 
contexts:  
 CRC review determining dose escalation ( Section  6.3.2 ).  
 CRC review in defining the MTD.  
 Investigator (and Medical Monitor) review for determining discontinuation of study 
treatment in individual patients.  
6.3.2.  Cohort Review Committee   
The CRC is comprised of the Idera Medical Monitor and Investigators from participating sites. 
Once the last patient in a given cohort has completed a cycle of study treatment, a CRC meeting 
will be convened to review all safety data and decide whether to c ontinue or halt dose escalation, 
further expand individual dose levels to gain additional safety data, or explore lower or 
intermediate dose levels.  
The CRC  will conduct a review of safety data upon completion  of each dose escalation cohort  
and periodical ly during  Dose Expansion  (Phase 2) .  
In addition to end -of cohort meetings, the CRC will convene periodically  to review safety data 
for ongoing patients and patients in follow up.  
The roles of the CRC are to:  
 Review and provide definitive adjudication on individual DLTs , if needed  
(Section  6.3.1 ). 
 Perform dose esc alation review and make specific recommendations for  the progress 
of the study ( Section 6.3.3 ). 
 Determine the MTD.  
6.3.3.  Dose E scalation Enrollment and Review  
Each dose esc alation cohort is expec ted to enroll at least three  patients, with a maximu m of six 
patients . The number of patients enrolled in any of the planned dose esc alation cohorts can be 
reduced if safety at that dose has already been demonstrated in a related population (e.g. , WM).  
 If the initial three patients c omplete all [ADDRESS_63657] a dose esc alation review.  
 If one of the initial three patients experiences a DLT event prior to completing 
Cycle  1, then enrollment at that dose level wil l continue to a total of s ix patients and 
the dose esc alation review will be done when all six patients have completed Cycle 1 . 
 If two patients at a dose -level experience DLT events during the Cycle 1 , then no 
further patients will be enrolled until the CRC completes a review, which should be 
done as soon as feasible.

Idera Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Confidential and Proprietary   Furthermore, cohorts may be expanded to include additional patients if such patients 
can be enrolled ≤[ADDRESS_63658] (or sixth) patient was first dosed with 
IMO -8400 . 
The CRC review will include all available safety data . To fa cilitate standardizing the dose 
escalation reviews across different cohorts, the focu s will be on observations from Cycle 1 at that 
dose level.   
The following represent anticipated outcomes for the review proces s:  
 Approval of enrollment in the expansion cohort  at that dose level , if applicable.  
 Dose esc alation – progression to the next planned dose level.  
 Continue cohort enrollment (applicable only to review after three patients) – enroll up 
to six patients at  the current dose level to obtain additional safety data for subsequent 
review.  
 Increase the number of patients treated at a given pre -specified or intermediary dose 
level to better define the safety profile of IMO -[ADDRESS_63659] patient in a cohort completes Cycle 1 .  
 Dose de -escalation – enrollment of an interm ediate level contingency cohort  to 
facilitate identifying the MTD . 
 No further dose esc alation enrollment – at this time the CRC will indicate the dose 
level they consider represents the MTD.  
The CRC comprises  experienced clinicians, who  will make recommendations based on their 
judgment. In consideration of the dynamic nature of early phase studies, those recommendations  
may include alternative courses of action  not anticipated here .  
6.4. Phase 2: Dose Expansion Cohort  
Once the RP2D  has been  established, additional patients will be treated in a dose expansion 
phase that is designed to better characterize the safety, tolerability and preliminary anti -tumor 
activity of the study drug when provided at the RP2D  to patients with non-GCB subtype  DLBCL 
with MYD88 L265P mutations . Phase 2 utilizes a Si mon two-stage design  [8], consisting of an 
open -label treatment of patients at the RP2D. Initially [ADDRESS_63660] two of the 10 patients respond, the study will enroll 19 m ore patients, for a total of 
29 patients in the Phase 2 portion.  Additional dose -expansion cohorts may be added if clinical 
activity is seen during the dose escalation phase in tumors th at lack this mutation.  
Treatment will continue until disease progression, intolerable toxicity (despi[INVESTIGATOR_58349]), withdrawal of consent, start of another anti -cancer therapy, or study completion, 
whichever occurs first .

anti-cancer therapy, or study complet ion, whichever occurs first.  
Patients discontinued from treatment  for reasons other than progressive disease will be assessed 
at a minimum of every 12 weeks for overall survival (OS) until documentation of progressive 
disease, initiation of new anti -cancer  therapy, or the end of the study, whichever comes first. 
Patients who are tolerating treatment may be escalated to any dose level that has been deemed 
safe by [CONTACT_58394].  In certain 
instances, patie nts may be deriving clinical benefit despi[INVESTIGATOR_58350].  It can be anticipated that based on the study drug’s 
mechanism of action, through an immunologic mediated effect, signs of radiol ogic response may 
be delayed.  Based on these considerations, continuing to treat some patients past progressive 
disease  may be considere d after discussion between the Sponsor and I nvestigator .  
6.5.2.  Dose Modification in Patients with DLT Events  
Patients determined to have a  DLT event may resume  treatment at the next lowest dose level  
(Table  3) after dose interruption and with dose modification if all of the follo wing criteria are 
met:  
 The patient is receiving > 0.6 mg/kg /week ; patients receiving 0.6 mg/kg /week  will be 
discontinued.  
 The patient has not previously had dose interruption and/or adjustment for a  
DLT  event.  
 Both the Investigator and the Medical Monitor consider that continued treatment with 
study drug is in the patient’s interest.  
 The DLT  event improve s at least two grades  or returns to baseline  within [ADDRESS_63661] treatment 
discontinued permanently and will proceed to End-of-Treatment (EOT) and End -of-Study (EOS)  
visits .  
6.5.3.  Procedures for Assessment of Patients with  Decreases  in Complement Levels  
Activat ion of complement in non -human primates is a well -described effect of phosphorothioate 
oligonucleotides, including IMO -8400. Monkeys are thought to be particularly sensitive to 
oligonucleotide -induced complement activation and a similar direct oligonucleot ide-induced 
complement activation has not been observed in humans or other  species. Specifically, in a 
39 week chron ic toxicity study conducted in c ynomolgus monkeys,  3 of 28 animals administered 
IMO -8400 at dose levels ≥ 6 mg/kg/week were found dead or sa crificed moribund during the 
study with necropsy findings of myocardial degeneration/necrosis, glomerulonephritis, a nd/or 
hepatocellular necrosis. Adverse microscopic findings were also noted in two 6 mg/kg/week -
IMO -8400   Page 44 of 91 
Protocol 8400 -402, Version 4.0 29 Jan 2016  
 
Idera Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Confidential and Proprietary  treated animals that survived to the termina l sacrifice. Findings consisted of minimal 
degeneration/necrosis of the myocardium in one animal and slight subacute vasculitis in the heart 
of the other.  Of the five animals on study with adverse, treatment -related, anatomic pathology 
findings, all had pe rturbations in serum complement and serum chemistry parameters consistent 
with an acute phase response (most notably globulin and C -reactive protein  [CRP] ) in the weeks 
and months prior to either their unscheduled deaths or the scheduled terminal necropsy.  Effects 
on clinical pathology parameters associated with the target organ toxicity in these animals 
(increased troponin I concentrations, liver enzyme activities, and/or urine protein:urine creatinine 
ratio) occurred later in the study when compared to ef fects on serum complement and serum 
chemistry parameters that were consistent with an acute phase response.  
If at any time during study participation, a patient experiences an acute drop in complement 
component (CH50, C3 or C4) levels, defined as ≥ 50% wit h reference to baseline testing or most 
recent values on study or a drop to an absolute value of < 10 mg/dL , the following procedures 
and testing should be performed:  
1. Hold study drug treatment  
2. Repeat the serum complement test to confirm decreased complemen t levels  
3. Query patient for recent change in signs or symptoms suggestive of a rheumatologic or 
vasculitic event, i.e. , recent appearance of a rash or bruising, new onset symptoms such 
as fever, arthralgias, or fatigue  
4. Perform physical examination  with care ful attention to findings suggestive of vasculitis; 
i.e., rash, palpable purpura, petechiae  
5. Perform repeat  complete blood count ( CBC ) with platelets, or review most recent 
CBC/platelets  
6. Perform repeat urinalysis, or review most recent urinalysis with speci al attention to 
findings suggestive of glomerulonephritis; i.e., presence of protein, blood, red blood cell 
(RBC ) casts or white blood cell ( WBC ) casts  
7. Perform an ECG  
Based on the results of this work -up and the patient’s disease assessment/response to study drug, 
the Investigator in discussion with the Sponsor ’s medical monitor, will determine the patient’s 
risk/benefit profile and discuss appropriate next steps re garding the patient’s continued  
participation in the study.  
6.5.4.  Procedures for Assessment of Patients with Symptomatic Thrombocytopenia  
Severe thrombocytopenia has been reported in clinical studies with another oligonucleotide  [29]. 
Most of these patients had confi rmed anti -platelet antibodies.  These cases occurred 14 to 
26 months after the onset of treatment, suggesting that risk increases with duration of exposure. 
In the event of a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_58351] (i.e. , to <2 5 x 109/L), treatment with 
IMO -8400 should be held and an a nti-platelet antibody count obtained.  Treatment can be 
resumed once pre-treatment criteria ( Section  8.4.1 ) are met.  Antipla telet, thrombolytic, or 
anticoagulant drugs should be used with caution.

Idera Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Confidential and Proprietary  6.5.5.  Classification of Patients at Termination of Treatment  
To provide for consistent ac counting of patient disposition  when study treatment is discontinued 
in an individu al patient for any reason, the I nvestigator will complete the appropriate  electronic  
case report form ( eCRF) and select the primary reason  for discontinuation of treatment  from the 
following standard categories:  
 DLT event  – defined above.  
 Disease progression  – as defin ed above.  
 AE, other than DLT  – this includes any AE (clinical or labo ratory; serious or 
non-serious; regardless of relation to study drug), that represents the reason study 
drug was discontinued, including:  
– The medical judgment of the Investigator  based on the best interests of the 
patient.  
– The patient’s request based on any AE.  
 Withdrawal of consent  – the patient desired to withdraw from further participation in 
the study in the absence of a clinical issue. If the patient gave a reason for 
withdrawing (e.g., leaving area), it should be recorded in the eCRF.  
 Lost to follow  up – the patient stopped coming for visits.  
 Study termination  – by [CONTACT_1034], for any reason.  
When study treatment is discontinued prematurely for any reason, the  EOT  and EOS  visits will  
be performed as specified ( Section 1.4). If a patient cannot be seen, attempts will be made to 
contact [CONTACT_16014][INVESTIGATOR_58352].   
6.5.6.  Study Duration  
The study will end following completion of the response assessment in the expansion phase  or 
approximately [ADDRESS_63662] patient has begun treatment . Study treatment may be  
discontinued in an individual patient before this planne d duration  as described in Section  6.5.5 . 
Follow u p: 
All treated patien ts will have an EOT  visit within [ADDRESS_63663] data for safety, PK, progressive disease , immunogenicity and tumor response. A n EOS 
visit will occur 30 -35 days after the patient’ s last administration of study drug. Additionally , 
patients discontinued from treatment  for reasons  other than progressive disease  will be assessed 
per Revised Response Criteria  for Lymphoma ( Section  16.2) at a minimum of every [ADDRESS_63664] . 
Survival follow u p: 
Following disease progression, patients will be contact[CONTACT_457] 12 weeks for the subsequent use 
of anti -cancer therapy as well as for survival until  study completion .

Idera Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Confidential and Proprietary  6.6. Criteria for Replacement of Patients  
6.6.1.  Definition of a Evaluable  Patient  
A patient will be considered evaluable  for purposes of CRC review if they m eet either  of the 
following criteria:  
 Received at least one  dose of study drug and had treatment discontinued because of a 
DLT event as defined in Section  6.3.1 ; or 
 Completed Cycle 1 successfully  as scheduled and completed Cycle 2, Day 1  
assessment  procedures.  
See Section 12 for additional discussion of analysis for safety and efficacy.  
6.6.2.  Replacement of Patients  
A patient who does not meet criteria for “ evaluable ” may be replaced to assure the requirements 
for co mpleting the cohort are met. Replacement patients will be identified by [CONTACT_58395].  
6.7. Maximum Number of Patien ts  
The maximum exposures to IMO -8400, the investigational agen t in this study, will be as follows:  
 Maximum number of patients: Up to 59 patients  in planned escalation and expansion 
cohorts ; potential for additional patients in contingency cohorts or as replacement s. 
 Treatment is until progression or intolerable toxicity, therefore the maximum number 
of dose  level s is not pre -specified.  
6.8. Treatment Assignment  
Enrollment procedures are presented in  Section 9.4. 
6.9. Criteria for Study Termination  
The Sponsor reserves the right to discontinue or suspend the study at any time, at an individual 
site or overall, for safety or for administrative reasons . In the event of such action, the Sponsor 
will:  
 Promptly inform the impacted  Investigators and institutions, the regulatory 
authorities, and the Institutional Review Board ( IRB) of the action  and the reason(s) 
for the action.  
 Arrange for all study documentation to be archived at the site ( Section 11.9) or 
returned to the Sponsor, as appropriate; and for any remaining study medication to be 
properly disposed of ( Section 8.7.1 ).  
6.10. Discussion of Study Design  and Treatment Regimens  
This protocol represents the first clinical trial of IMO -[ADDRESS_63665] whether the clinical activity of IMO -8400 is 
greater than  a null response rate of 10%  (see Section 12.1 for sample size analysis) . It is designed 
with an interim analysis for futility . Results from this study will guide further development of 
IMO -8400 in oncology/hematology.  
6.10.2.  Rationale for Treatment Regimens in Current Protocol  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Dosing Regimen  
Starting dose/ Safety.  Following the completion of Study 8400 -001 performed in healthy 
volunteers , Study 8400 -201 was conducted in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. 
A total of 46 patients were enrolled in the study and t reatment with IMO -8400 was administered 
SC weekly for 12 weeks . Thir ty five patients were treated with IMO -8400 at dose levels 0.075, 
0.15, 0.3, or 0.6 mg/kg/week, and eleven  patients were randomized to placebo (sali ne). 
IMO -8400 was safe and well -tolerated in doses up to 0.6  mg/kg/week in patients with psoriasis.  
A concurrent Phase 1/2 study of IMO -8400 is ongoing in p atients with relapsed/refractory 
WM (Study 8400 -401). This is an open -label, multiple -dose, dose esc alation study and is 
evaluating the safety, tolerability, and preliminary clinical activity of IMO -8400. As of the most 
recent interim analysis  from September [ADDRESS_63666] been enrolled at dose  level s up to 
1.2 mg/kg given twice weekly. The most frequently noted AEs (>10%) were fatigue, injection 
site erythema, headache, injection site pain, nausea, and pain in extremity, all of which w ere 
low-grade. Grade  3 AEs were limited to neutropenia ( two patient s), anemia (2), and arthritis (1). 
No Grade 4 AE s were reported.  A single epi[INVESTIGATOR_58353] (ar thritis flare) was reported in one of 
eight  patient s enrolled in the 1.2 mg/kg/ twice weekly  cohor t. Dose escalation is ongoing as the 
MTD has not been reached [7].  
Dose regimen. The initial clinical indications for development of IMO -8400 were autoimmune 
disease s, where TLR antagonism serves to modulate the immune system and decrease 
inappropriate im mune activation. In this context, once weekly dosing was assessed as 
appropriate and sufficient.  
In B-cell malignancies, cell responses, proliferation , and survival are abnormal. In vitro  studies 
with cell lines bearing the MYD88 L265P  indicate pathologic  activation of TLR signaling 
pathways, with apparent overreaction to TLR ligands. The application of TLR antagonism in this 
context is expected to require more sustained receptor blockade than physiologic 
immunomodulation. Therefore, in this initial trial of DLBCL, a life -threatening, aggressive 
malignancy , more intensive  dosing is considered appropriate.  
As noted the starting regimen (0.3 mg/kg twice weekly) represents simple dose fractionation of 
the total weekly exposure that has been observed to be wel l-tolerated in healthy volunteers and in 
IMO -8400   Page 48 of 91 
Protocol 8400 -402, Version 4.0 29 Jan 2016  
 
Idera Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Confidential and Proprietary  patients with psoriasis  (0.6 mg/kg once weekly) . Dose esc alation will proceed based on review of 
safety experience with  dose fractionation at this level.  
Dose E scalation.  Sequential dose esc alation is consistent with current practices an d is supported 
by [CONTACT_58396] [ADDRESS_63667] a poor prognosis following 
relapse with presence of the M YD88 L2 65 mutation being an independent predictor of poor 
outcome  [9]. IMO -8400 has been shown to be effective in pre -clinical lymphoma models that 
carry this mutation  [5]. Preliminary evidence for clinical activity has also been established in a 
related B -cell malignancy ( WM) in patients both with and without M YD88 L265 mutations  [7].

Idera Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Confidential and Proprietary  8.3. Reconstitution of IMO -8400 for Injection  
IMO -8400 is provided as 150 mg of lyophilized powder in a 5 -mL vial, to be reconstituted into 
solution for injection prior to use. The active drug concentration for all dose  level s of 
2.4 mg/kg /dose  and higher will be 200 mg/mL. Detailed dose preparation instructions and flow 
sheets are provided in the Pharmacy Manual.  
8.4. Administration of Study Treatments  
Each dose of IMO -8400 will be administered as SC injection (s), not to exceed 1.2  mL/site, with 
multiple sites used per dose as necessary. For example, a 300 mg  dose would be administered as 
two separate injections of 0.75  mL. The injection sites  should be selected based on the following:  
 There are six potential a reas for injection : the four quadrants of the abdomen (upper 
and lower on the left and right) and the thigh of each leg . 
 Injection site (s) should be rotated ; that is, assuming all injection areas are suitable, 
each area would be used once every six dose injections .  
If, because of injury or other issue, an injection site area will be used more frequently than once 
every 2 weeks, the Investigator should discuss the situation with the  Medical Monitor.  
8.4.1.  Pre-Treatment Criteria  
IMO -8400 should not be administered until the following conditions are met:  
 Hemoglobin ≥7.5 g/dL  
 ANC ≥1 ,000/µL  
 Platelets ≥50,000/µL  
 All other laboratory abnormalities to baseline or grade ≤1  
8.4.2.  Variances in Dose Administration Schedule  
Dosing should ideally be performed on the same day each week; however, allowances of up to 
48 hours (±) will be made for unavoidable scheduling conflicts.  
If, for any reason (e.g., scheduling or toxicity), dosing is interrupted mor e than five calendar days 
beyond expected, then the next dose should be administered as soon as feasible and the schedule 
reset.  
If, for any reason, dosing is interrupted more than [ADDRESS_63670] study visit  will be 
recorded in the eCRF , including dose, dosage regimen, and indication (reason for its 
prescription ).

Idera Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Confidential and Proprietary  8.5.1.  Prohibited Treatment s 
The exclusion criteria specify treatments prohibited at the time of study entry ( Section  1.5.3 ). 
While patients are receiving study treatment, other treatments for DLBCL  are prohibited. 
Patients who discontinue treatment prematurely and have completed the EOT  visit, may receive 
available or investigational  treatment for their disease at any time based on the judgment of their 
physician. If such treatment is initiated prior to the EOS  visit (scheduled for [ADDRESS_63671] dose of study drug), this will be recorded in concomitant medications and considered in 
assessment of any new AEs.  
8.6. Treatment Compliance  
All doses of study drug will be administered by [CONTACT_58403]. Injections of study drug may 
be administered  in one of two contexts:  
 Study site  – defined as the site designated by [CONTACT_58404]. On study 
days when a physical examination or laboratory safety test is scheduled  it is expected 
that study drug will be administered at the study site.   
 Non-study s ite administration  by a visiting nurse  – With the agreement of the patient 
and the Investigator , dose s not administered at the study site may be administered by 
a visiting nurse who has been trained in the protocol and approved by [CONTACT_1034].  
The Sponsor will arrange for a Central Pharmacy to prepare and dispense the patient’s study 
treatment, which will be packaged as re quired and shipped to the patient  by [CONTACT_58405]. To protect the integrity of the treatment, patients will be instructed to hold the shippi[INVESTIGATOR_58355] a cool, dry, protected place.  
 The visiting nurse will open the container, in spect the materials, confirm they are 
correct, and proceed with pre -dose procedures, stud y drug administration, and 
post-dose procedures.  
The used syringe and packaging materials will be disposed of per policy of the Central 
Pharmacy.  
The visiting nurse will maintain appropriate source documents; the events will be entered into 
the Electronic Data Capture ( EDC ) system and copi[INVESTIGATOR_58356].  
8.7. Accountability  of Investigational Drug Supplies  
Study drug will be provided by [CONTACT_1034] . The Investigator at each study site and a designated 
pharmacist at the Central Pharmacy are  responsible for the control of the study drug,  and will 
identify trained and experienced personnel to handle it in accordance with the  protocol and 
appropriate GCP and GMP principles. (Central Pharmacy will be responsible for study drug 
stored at Central Ph armacy and dispensed to patient s for non -study site administration ). This 
includes:  
 Storing the drug in a secure, control led-access location.  
IMO -8400   Page 53 of 91 
Protocol 8400 -402, Version 4.0 29 Jan 2016

recording of storage temperature.  
 Maintaining records of the receipt of study  drug and provid ing acknowledgement of 
receipt.  
 Dispensing and administering study drug o nly in accordance  with the protocol, 
including proper labeling of individual doses prepared in syringes ready for use.  
 Maintaining drug accountability records indicating the disposition of study drug , 
including a Drug Dispensing Log contain ing the followi ng information:  
 Identification of the patient to whom the study drug was dispensed . 
 Date (s) and quantity of the study drug dispensed to the patient .  
 Having all records and drug supplies available for inspection by [CONTACT_11200].  
Treatment administere d to patients at non -study sites  by a visiting nurse will be prepared by a 
Central Pharmacy from supply provided by [CONTACT_1034]. The Central Pharmacy is also required 
to comply with the specifications above.  
8.7.1.  Disposition of Study Drug  
At any time during or after completion of the study, the site must obtain written authorization 
from the Sponsor regarding the final disposition of any remaining study drug; that disposition 
must be appropriately documented. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_58357] d rug 
include the following:  
 Returning s tudy drug to the Sponsor .  
 Destroying study drug at the study site according to the site’s institutional standard 
operating procedure . 
IMO -[ADDRESS_63672] treatment  of study drug, designated  Cycle 1,  Day 1. All times are 
relative to treatment , designated 0 h our. “Pre-dose” vital signs are to occur within 1 hour prior to 
treatment; all other pre -dose procedures are to occur prior to treatment on the same calendar day.  
9.2. Screening, including Sequence of P rocedures  
Pre-screening for the MYD88 L265P mutation may be performed as detailed in Section  1.5.1 . 
Protocol screening may be initiated up to 21 days prior to dosing. Written informed consent will 
be obtained before any study -specific procedures are performed and will be recorded in source 
documentation. The site will maintain a Patient Identification Log indicating all consented 
patients. Patients being considered for Phase 2 (Dose Expansion) should not undergo any 
additional screening work -up unless the MYD88 L265P mutation has already been documented 
(local or central lab; Section  1.5.1 ).  
9.3. Determinat ion of Presence or Absence of MYD88 L265P  Mutation in 
DLBCL  
Prior to enrolling a patient into the study, the patient’s  tumor  is to be tested  for the  
MYD88  L265P  mutation  using a CLIA -compliant assay performed at any point during the 
course of the patient’s  disease . If this has not been done, tumor may be sent to the S ponsor’s 
designated central laboratory to perform testing for the presence of the mut ation.  If this analysis 
had been previously performed using  a CLIA -compliant assay , all attempts should be made to 
procure either the original tumor tissue (previously collected at the time of diagnosis or at any 
point during the course of the patient’s di sease) or a fresh biopsy, if tissue is readily available 
(e.g., a superficial lymph node) , to repeat/confirm the mutation testing at the Sponsor ’s 
designated central laboratory and to perform oth er investigational studies ( Section 9.10). The 
sample will comprise formalin -fixed, paraffin -embedded (FFPE) tissue that is known to have a 
meaningful proportion of representative tumo r cells and is submitted either as a cell block or as 
unstained sections. The latter should include the following:  
 At least two unstained, mounted sections, 3 to 4 µm thick (to be processed for routine 
histology).  
 Unmounted sections (“curls” or “slices”) totaling 20 µm  thick (e.g., five curls each 
4 µm thick or two curls each 10 µm thick). The curls will be placed in a labeled 
microfuge tube for transport.  
The sample will be analyzed using an assay from Abbott Molecular  in development as a 
potential compan ion diagnostic , and th e results reported as either “ MYD88 L265P  mutation 
detected” or “L265P mutation not detected”. Samples may be retained for up to 1 year after the

Idera Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Confidential and Proprietary  end of the study (i.e., last patient, last visit) to support possible future development  of a 
companion diagnostic assay.  
9.4. Enrollment Procedure  
The following procedure is to assure that patients enrolled across multiple sites are assigned to 
the appropriate cohort and receive the appropriate dose level. Patients who have completed all 
screenin g procedures will have eligibility data entered into the study EDC (electronic data 
capture) system, including the Investigator s assessment of the patient’s eligibility. The Sponsor 
or Sponsor’s designated representative will review the data; the patient’s  assigned dose level will 
then be provided in writing (by [CONTACT_54769]/or fax) to both the Investigator  and the site pharmacy.  
9.5. Disease  Evaluations  
Radiologic Imaging  – Radiographic tumor evaluation by [CONTACT_10052]/ computed tomography (CT) scan 
or CT scan of chest , abdomen, and pelvis will be performed within [ADDRESS_63673]  radiologic  tumor assessment s performed every 12 weeks  as a part 
of follow up ( Section  6.5.6 ) until documentation of progressive dis ease, initiation of new 
anti-cancer therapy, or the end of the study, whichever comes first. The same radiographic 
assessments  used at Screening  should  be used at all subsequent radiographic evaluations.  Interim 
scans may be done at the request of the Investigator based on new clinical indications, signs or 
symptoms. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_58358].   
Lymph node biopsy  – Archival or fresh tumor tissue should be submitted to the central lab for 
confirmation of diagnosis and exploratory analyses (as described in Section  9.10). At least 
one post-treatment b iopsy should also be performed in order to evaluate target engagement. 
These should be collected between [ADDRESS_63674] -treatment and may be obtained at any 
time during study participation. Instructions for submitting biopsy sections are provided (see  the 
Laboratory Manual for more details).  
9.6. Assessment of Response to Treatment  
Following enrollment, the patient’s disease status will be assessed every 8 weeks during study 
treatment, and  at the EOT visit  to permit evaluation of the response to treatment.  In addition to 
routine clinical examination, these assessments will include PET \CT scanning  or CT alone,  and 
lymph node  biopsy, as detailed in Section  9.5.  
Table  11 summarizes the criteria for response to treatment. The full text of the  International 
Working Group  classification  [1] is provided in Section 16.2.

9.7. General Clinical Assessments  
9.7.1.  Medical History , including DLBCL  
Prior to enrollment , the Investigator will obtain a comprehensive medical history  to ensure 
eligibility of the patients , including the following items:  
 A detailed review of the course of the patient’s malignancy , including clinically 
significant complications such as systemic infections, bleeding events, etc.  
 Prior treatments , including supportive therapy  (agent, best clinical response, AEs 
related to treatment , and reason for discontinuation) . 
IMO -8400   Page 57 of 91 
Protocol 8400 -402, Version 4.0 29 Jan 2016  
 
Idera Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Confidential and Proprietary   Relevant current or past abnormalities or diseases (including surgical procedures) of 
the following syste ms: allergic (including drug sensitivity), cardiovascular, 
dermatologic, endocrine/metabolic, gastrointestinal, gynecologic, 
hematologic/lymphatic, hepatic/biliary, immunologic, infectious, musculoskeletal, 
neurologic/psychiatric, renal, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_696].  
Past history should include a ll significant illnesses that the patient has experienced during  the 
[ADDRESS_63676] resolved as well as 
those that  are active . Illnesses active at the time of informe d consent will be regarded as 
concomitant illnesses.  After obtaining informed consent, c oncomitant illnesses that worsen or 
new illnesses that emerge will be documented as AEs (Section  10). 
9.7.2.  Physical Examination and Body Weight  
Complete physical examinations will include examination of general appearance, skin, neck 
(including thyroid), eyes, nose, throat, heart, lungs, abdomen , lymph nodes, extremities, 
reproductive (in event of recent history, symptoms, or AEs related to reproductive system) and 
nervous system and measurement of body weight. Complete physical examination is required 
prior to enrollment  and EOT and EOS. Directe d physical examinations may be performed while 
on study treatment at the discretion of the Investigator . Exam of reproductive system, when 
needed, may be performed by [CONTACT_58406] a specialist.  
Height and weight will be evaluated prior to enrollment and the BMI will be calculated.  
Any clinically significant changes in physical exam identified after obtaining informed consent 
will be reported as AEs ( Section  10). 
9.7.3.  Vital Signs  
Vital signs include heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP), respi[INVESTIGATOR_697] (RR) , and temperature. 
Vital signs will be performed once weekly  for patients receiving once weekly do sing and twice 
weekly for patients receiving twice weekly dosing,  immediately befor e each administration 
(within 1  hour of treatment ) and post-dose (within 30 min [±5 min] of treatment ). Vital  signs 
should be after the patient has been sitting comfortably for [ADDRESS_63677] and may be 
done ma nually or by [CONTACT_16019];  RR will be determined by [CONTACT_58407] 
30 seconds ; temperature will be obtained using an electronic (rapid reading) device.  
Vital sign measurements will be assessed by [CONTACT_58408] ‘normal’, ‘abnormal, not 
clinically significant’, or ‘ab normal, clinically significant’ . Clinically significant abnormal vital 
sign measurements will be reported as an AE , and, if possible, should be repeated at clinically 
relevant intervals until resolved or stabilized.  
9.7.4.  Electrocardiogram  
Standard 12 -lead ECG will be obtained after the patient has been semi -recumbe nt for 
~10 minutes. The following ECG parameters will be recorded : ventricular  rate, RR interval, 
PR interval, QRS interval, and QT interval; also QTc, if available, including method of 
calculation .  
IMO -[ADDRESS_63678] ions will be documented in detail for each individual injection  as described in 
Table  12 and recorded  in the  injection site assessment form in the  eCRF . 
The Investigator will assess the injection site as scheduled and perform the following:  
 Pain, tenderness, pruritus and indurat ion: grade using the scale provided ;  
 For induration, also record the actual maximal linear diameter as a continuous 
variable;  
 Erythema, record the actual maximal linear diameter as a continuous variable;  
 Blisters, ulceration, necrosis: indicate presence  or absence and record the maximal 
linear diameter, if applicable.

Pain: discomfort or unpleasant feeling (e.g., headache) experienced while at rest or with activity; in addition to location, the 
patient’s description may include intensity as well a distinctive quality (e.g., burning, stabbing).  
Tenderness: discomfort el icited when the area is touched either intentionally or accidently.  
Pruritus (itch): an unpleasant sensation that evokes the desire or reflex to scratch. (In contrast, pain and tenderness evoke  a reflex 
to withdraw.)  
Activities of daily living (ADL) are c lassified into two subsets:  
– instrumental ADL, e.g., preparing meals, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3112], using the telephone, managing money;  
– self-care ADL, e.g., bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, and no t being 
bedridden.  
Injection site reactions may also be captured on the AE form. When reporting injection site 
reactions as an AE, the Investigator should report in the verbatim term the words “injection site 
reaction ,” along with the specific reaction sym ptom (such as erythema), and select the severity 
grade based on the National Cancer Institute -Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 
(NCI-CTCAE ) guidelines which are presented in Table 13.

Procedures for the Investigator  assessment of the results are detailed in Section 10.2. Procedures 
for the analysis of laboratory data are described in Section 10.4.5 .  
9.8.3.  Repeating Abnormal Laboratory Tests  
Laboratory tests showing abnormal or exclusionary values prior to enrollment  may be repeated 
no more than once , except non -negative screening serology results  will be exclusionary and will 
not be repeated . After dosing, a bnormal laboratory tests assessed as “clinically significant” 
values may be repeated as often as deemed clinically necessary by [CONTACT_58410].  
9.9. Pharm acokinetic Assessments  
Blood samples for plasma levels of IMO -8400 will be collected as scheduled  (Table 4). Samples 
will be analyzed for IMO -8400 concentration using a validated bioanalytical method. For each 
cohort, the plasma IMO -8400 concentration data will be analyzed by [CONTACT_105] -compartmental PK 
analysis. The following parameters will be determined as appropriat e: observed maximum 
plasma concentration (C max), time of C max (Tmax), and AUC from [ADDRESS_63680] measurable plasma 
concentration (AUC 0-t).  Pharmacokinetic parameters will be compared across IMO -8400 dose 
levels.  Descriptive statistics will be provided for all  PK parameter values by [CONTACT_58386], as 
appropriate.  
9.10. Pharmacodynamic and  Investigational Studies  
The central laboratory will distribute samples to the specialty laboratories  that will  perform the 
following studies  on the tumor sample and on serum and plasma samples collected as scheduled 
to assess  the pharmacologic effects of  the investigational agent ; to maximize consistency, tests 
may be batched. The clinical significance of these tests is unknown at this time and therefore the 
results will not be assessed by [CONTACT_737] .

assayed for:  
 Presence  of somatic mutations in other genes encod ing proteins in the TLR and 
BCR  signaling pathways (e.g., CARD11, IRAK4, Btk).  
Pre-dose s erum samples will be assayed for:  
 Levels of cytokines such  as IL-6, IL-12, IL -17, IP-10; a dditional or alternative 
cytokines may be assessed using the samples collected.  
 Antibodies to IMO -8400 .  
Plasma samples will be assayed for MYD88  L265 P mutation  and may be assayed for additional 
mutations .  
Bone marrow biopsy  – Bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_6706]/or biopsy is not required for disease 
assessment  and is an optional procedure ; however , any available specimens may be submitted for 
exploratory analyses whenever marrow is obta ined.  Instructions for submitting to the ce ntral 
laboratory are provided  (see the Laboratory Manual for more details ). 
IMO -[ADDRESS_63681]. 1 An AE can be a new occurrence or an existing process that increases significantly in 
intensity or frequency.   
An AE in a clinical trial may be any of the following:  
 Unfavorable and unintended symptom reported by [CONTACT_102]  — patients will be 
encouraged to report treatment -emergent AEs spontaneously; general, non -directed 
questioning may also b e used to elicit reports of AEs.   
 Clinical sign detected by [CONTACT_737]  — observations by [CONTACT_58411].   
 Abnormal result from a  laboratory  study  or other diagnostic  procedure  that meets at 
least one of the following criteria:  
– Resul ts in termination of study drug.  
– Leads to treatment.   
– Leads to furth er diagnostic tests (other than a single repeat for confirmation).  
– Is assessed as “clinically signif icant” by [CONTACT_737] ( Section 10.2).  
10.1.2.  Serious Adverse Event 
An AE is serious  when the patient outcome is one or more of the following:  
 Death.  
 Life-threatening, meaning that the patient was at immediate risk of death from the 
event at the time that the event occurred. It does not include an event which 
hypothetically might have caused death if it occurred in a more severe form.  
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], initial or prolonged, meaning that a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_26179]/or 
prolongation of a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_58360], or occurred 
as a consequence of the event. It does not include a pre -planned elective hospi[INVESTIGATOR_58361], or, in general, a hos pi[INVESTIGATOR_58362] 24  hours duration.  
 Disability or incapacity that is persistent or significant .  
 Congenital anomaly or birth defect.  
                                                 
[ADDRESS_63682] in this protocol will hereafter be referred to as study drug (synonym: investigational agent).  
IMO -8400   Page 63 of 91 
Protocol 8400 -402, Version 4.0 29 Jan 2016  
 
Idera Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Confidential and Proprietary   Important medical event  that, although not immediately life -threatening, requires 
intervention in order to prevent one of the other serious outcomes listed above. 
Examples of such events are allergic bronchospasm req uiring intensive treatment in 
an emergency room or at home; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
10.1.3.  Suspected, Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction  
A suspected, unexpected  serious adverse reaction ( S[LOCATION_003]R ) is defined as an SAE that meets both 
the following criteria with respect to study drug:  
 Suspected  — is assessed as related or possibly  related to study drug ( Section  10.4.3 ). 
 Unexpected  — compared to the study drug -related AEs described in  the IB, the event 
meets any of the following criteria:  
– The event  was not previously described.  
– The event is now ch aracterize d as more severe ( Section 10.4.4 ). 
– The event is now characterized more specifically (e.g., an event of “interstitial 
nephritis” in a patient receivi ng an agent previously described as associated with 
“acute renal failure”).  
In clinical trials involving ill patients, events considered related to the natural history of the 
disease under study or to lack of efficacy (that is, the event is considered more  likely related to 
those factors than to other factors, including study drug) are not considered "unexpected". Lack 
of efficacy is recorded as specified elsewhere in the protocol.  
10.2. Investigator Assessment of Safety Laboratory Tests  
The Investigator will re view the results of a ll Safety Laboratory tests ( Section 9.8.2 ) and 
designate any results outside of the reference range as either  of the following:   
 Abnormal, not clinically significant (NCS) . 
 Abnormal, clinicall y significant (CS).  
In making this judgment, the Investigator will consider all available information, including the 
patient’s clinical condition, all available laboratory results (central an d local), and the potential 
for false positive test results. In addition, laboratory studies that result in the actions specified in 
Section 10.1.1  will be classified as CS.  
Any result assessed as CS will be recorded as an AE unless  it is consistent with one or more of 
the following:  
 Process noted in the me dical history.  
 Ongoing AE already recorded.  
 Expected course of the primary disease under stud y.  
IMO -8400   Page 64 of 91 
Protocol 8400 -402, Version 4.0 29 Jan 2016  
 
Idera Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Confidential and Proprietary  10.3. Recording Adverse Event s 
Procedures for the collection and recording of AEs are as follows:  
 From obtaining informed consent through EOS,  there will be active surveillance to 
identify all AEs . Events will be recorded in the AE portion of the EDC, with 
particular attention to whether the onset of the event was before or after the 
administration of the first dose of study drug. All recorded events will be included in 
applicable line listings, but only events with onset after administration of the first 
dose will be included in summaries of TEAEs (Section 12.3). 
 After the EOS, surveillance will be passive (only events brought to the Investigator ’s 
attention will be considered) and only events assessed  as S[LOCATION_003]Rs will be recorded 
(Section 10.1.3 ). 
 In accordance with FDA Guidance Document – Safety Reporting Requirements for 
Investigational New Drugs (INDs) and Bioavailability/Bioequivalence (BA/BE)  
Studies, disease progression does not require reporting as an AE or SAE. However, 
signs and symptoms related to disease may be rep orted at the discretion of the 
Investigator.   
10.4. Characterizing Adverse Events 
For each AE recorded the following characteristics will be noted.  
10.4.1.  Description of Event  
The diagnosis or description will be as specific and complete as possible (i.e., “lower extremity 
edema”, rather than just “edema”). Whenever possible, signs and sympt oms due to a common 
etiology will be reported as an integrated diagnosis; for example, cough, runny nose, sneezing, 
sore throat and head congestion would be reported as “upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_4416]”.  
10.4.2.  Date and Time of Onset  
The date and time at which the event was first apparent. Table  14 summarizes the basis for 
reporting the date and time of onset for the different types of AEs .  
Table  14: Reporting the Date and Time of Onset of AE for Different Types of Events  
Type of Event  Examples  Source of Date and Time of Onset  
Symptom  Headache, feverish, parest hesiae   When first experienced by [CONTACT_16034] (Finding)  Elevated BP,  enlarged liver on physical 
exam  When first observed by [CONTACT_16035] / 
diagnostic result  Neutropenia, hyperglycemia,  
lesions on brain scan  When lab sample was obtained or diagnostic study 
performed  
The time of onset of symptoms may be appreciably earlier than the date and time the Investigator 
becomes aware of the event. Some events may be apparent to the patient and Investigator 
independently, and information from each may contribute to the final re port. For example, a 
patient may report the onset of a rash 2 days before being seen by a physician who makes a 
diagnosis of herpes zoster based on appearance and laboratory confirmation. In that case, there is 
IMO -8400   Page 65 of 91 
Protocol 8400 -402, Version 4.0 29 Jan 2016  
 
Idera Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Confidential and Proprietary  a single AE, with the date of onset based on the date of the initial observation by [CONTACT_5363] 
a specific description (herpes zoster) based on the clinical exam and tests.  
10.4.3.  Relationship to Study Drug  
This determination is based on the Investigator’s clinical judgment regarding the likelihood tha t 
the study drug caused the AE and may include consideration of some or all of the following 
factors:  
 Alternative possible causes of the AE, including the patient’s underlying disease or 
co-morbid conditions, other drugs, other  host and environmental fact ors. 
 Temporal sequence between the exp osure to study drug and the AE.  
 Whether the clinical or laboratory manifestations of the AE are consistent with known 
actions  or toxicity of the study drug.  
 Whether the AE resolved or improved with decreasing the dose or stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_58363] (i.e., dechallenge); or recurred or worsened with re -exposure to the drug 
(i.e., rechallenge).  
The relationship between the study drug and the AE will be described using one of the following 
categories:  
 Related — the study drug  is more likely the cause  of the AE than other factors.  
 Possibly related  — there is a reasonable possibility that the study drug is the cause of 
the AE, including that the study drug and another factor(s) are equa lly likely as 
causes of the AE.  
 Unlikely re lated  — another factor is considered more likely  the cause  of the AE than 
the study drug.  
 Not related  — another factor is considered to be the cause of the AE.  
Related and possibl y related AEs may result during the use of the study drug as planned (per 
protocol), or from abuse, withdrawal or over -dosage of the agent.  
10.4.4.  Intensity (Severity)  
The intensity (synonym: severity) of clinical AEs (i.e., symptoms reported by [CONTACT_5363]/or 
signs observed by [CONTACT_737] ) will be assessed using the guidelines  summarized in Table  15 
[30].

intervent ion/therapy required; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_29125].  
Life-threatening  Extreme limitation in activity; significant assistance required; significant medical 
intervention/therapy required; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_58364].  
10.4.5.  Grading of Laboratory Safety Tests  for Reporting and Analysis  
Treatment -emergent abnormal laboratory results will be handled as follows:  
 Graded using NCI -CTCAE Version 4.03 criteria  
 Assessed as potential DLT events based on p re-specified criteria ( Section  6.3.1 ). 
 Reported as AEs when assessed as “clinically significant” using the procedures and 
criteria detailed in Section  10.2.  
10.4.6.  Management of Study Drug upon Occurrence of an AE 
For each AE the Investigator will indicate which one of the following actions regarding the 
administration of study d rug was taken because of that AE:  
 Discontinued  (withdrawn)  — study drug was stopped p ermanently due to the AE.  
 Dosing Interrupted  — study drug regimen was modified by [CONTACT_58412] , 
i.e., one or more doses were not administered, but dr ug was no t stopped permanently.  
 Dose Decreased  — study drug regimen was modified by [CONTACT_58413], i.e., by 
[CONTACT_58414], strength or amount.  
 None  — no change in the administration of study medi cation.  
For patients whose treatment is paused and then resumed at a lower dose level as detailed in 
Section 6.5.2 , the management of study drug will be rec orded as “Dose Decreased”.  
10.4.7.  Actions Taken for Management of AE  
Adverse events  will be followed and managed by [CONTACT_737], including obtaining any 
supplemental studies needed to define the nature and/or cause of the event (e.g., laboratory tests, 
diagnostic procedures, consultation with other health care professionals).  
For e ach AE the Investigator will categorize as follows the actions taken to manage the AE:  
 Concomitant medication — one or more medica tions (prescription or

Idera Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Confidential and Proprietary   Other action — only non-medication action(s) were ordered as management of the 
AE (e.g., bed placed in Trendelenburg position, warm compresses applied to 
SC access site).  
 No action — no actions were ordered for management of the AE.  
10.4.8.  Follow up and Outc ome of AEs  
If possible, AEs will be followed until resolved (synonyms: recovered, recuperated, ended) either 
with or without sequelae, including for patients who prematurely discontinue treatment . For AEs 
that are assessed as not drug -related and are not resolved at the EOS  visit, follow  up may be 
limited with the approval of the Medical Monitor.  
The outcome of each event will be described using the following categories:  
 Resolved without sequela e — the event resolved an d patient returned to baseline.  
 Resolved with sequelae  — the event resolved but the patient is left with residual 
problems (e. g., functional deficits, pain).  
 Resolving  — at the last observ ation, the event was improving.  
 Not resolve d — at the last observ ation, the event was unchanged.  
 Death  (Fatal)  — to be used for the one AE which, in the judgment of the 
Investigator, was the primary  cause of death.  
 Unknown  — there were no observations after the onset (initial observation or report)  
of the event.  
Note: Resolving and Not Resolved may also be used for AEs that were unresolved at the time a 
patient died, but were not assessed as the primary cause of death.  
10.4.9.  Date and Time of Outcome  
For each class of outcome as defined above, Table  16 indicates the date and time to be recorded. 
As discussed in detail for date /  time of onset ( Section 10.4.2 ), determining the date/ time an 
event resolved (ended) should reflect the type of event and the source of the information.

conduct the study according to the Protocol, including compliance requirements and agreements. 
Guidelines for minor procedural variations (e.g., collection time  of blood samples) will be agreed 
to and documented by [CONTACT_16063]. Events 
conforming to those guidelines will not be considered deviations.  
For protocol deviations relating to individual patients, the even t and relevant circumstances will 
be recorded on source documents and on the appropriate eCRF ; reported to the Sponsor in a 
timely manner; and presented in the Clinical Study Report  (CSR) .  
Deviations that are not patient -specific (e.g., unauthorized use o f an investigational agent outside 
the protocol, either human administration or laboratory use) will be reported to the Sponsor in 
writing and copi[INVESTIGATOR_58368]  (TMF) .

The sections below indicate the overall structure and approach to the analysis of this study. A 
detailed Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) incorporating these sections below will be prepared 
separately and approved by [CONTACT_1034]. The SAP will  define populations for analysis, outline all 
data handling conventions, including software, and specify additional statistical methods to be 
used for analysis of safety, efficacy and PK.  
12.1. Sample Size Determination and Study Power  
Following identification of the RP2D, up to an additional 29 patients will be enrolled at the 
RP2D.  
Simon’s  two‐stage design [8] will be used to test the response rate at the RP2D. The null 
hypothesis that the true response rate is 10% will be tested against a one ‐sided alternative. In the 
first stage, 10 patients wil l be accrued. If there are one or fewer responses in these 10 patients, 
the study will be stopped. Otherwise, 19 additional patients will be accrued for a total of 29. The 
null hypothesis will be rejected if six or more responses are observed in 29 patient s. This design 
yields a type I error rate of 4.7% and power of 80.5% when the true response rate is 30%.   
12.2. Analysis Populations  
Analysis Populations : 
 DLT Evaluable Population: patients enrolled in the Phase 1 dose escalation portion of 
the study who receive  all planned doses of study drug during the DLT observation 
period or who discontinue treatment due to AEs. 
 Safety/Intent -to-Treat (ITT) Population: all patients who received at least 1 injection 
of study drug. 
 Efficacy Evaluable (EE) Population: all patie nts who are MYD88 L265p mutation 
positive  and are treated at the RP2D . 
 Per Protocol (PP) Population: all patients in the EE who had no major protocol 
violations that would potentially influence treatment effect.  
 Pharmacokinetic (PK) Population: all patients who had both a pre -dose and at least 
one analyzable post -dose PK sample.  
CRC review will be performed on the DLT Evaluable Population for the dose being considered. 
Safety analyses will be performed using the Safety /ITT Population. Efficacy endpoints will  be 
analyzed for the EE and PP P opulations. Response will also be tabulated for the 
Safety/ITT  Population. Pharmacodynamic and immunogenicity assessments will be analyzed for 
the Safety/ITT P opulation.  
12.3. Analysis of Safet y  
Safety analyses will be performed on the Safety /ITT Population. Safety observations will be 
analyzed using descriptive statistics and tabulation.  No formal statistical comparisons are 
IMO -8400   Page 77 of 91 
Protocol 8400 -402, Version 4.0 29 Jan 2016  
 
Idera Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Confidential and Proprietary  planned. All safety data will be presented in listings. Only TEAEs (o nset after the administration 
of the first dose of study drug) will be summarized in the Tables.  
Primary Safety and Tolerability Endpoints : 
 Number of DLTs  
 Frequency and intensity of AEs  
 Physical examination findings, including vital signs  
 Laboratory safety  tests including hematology, chemistry, coagulation , urinalysis and 
complement levels  
 Assessment of injection site reactions ( ISRs ) 
 ECG findings  
Safety Analyses  
Adverse events will be coded using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) 
versio n 16.0 and tabulated by [CONTACT_15992], grade, and relationship to study treatment. Safety analyses 
will be descriptive in nature; no statistical hypothesis testing will be performed. Laboratory 
assessments for hematology, chemistry, coagulation, and special safety  tests (C3, C4, and CH50) 
will be tabulated via shift tables, tabulating each patient’s category at baseline via National 
Cancer Institute -Common Terminology Criteria for Adve rse Events (NCI -CTCAE), 
version  4.03 grading (normal and Grade 1 will be combined) versus their highest NCI -CTCAE 
grade on study.  Injection site reactions will be summarized by [CONTACT_58387]. Time -to-event analyses will be performed for ISRs.  
12.4. Analysis of Treatment Effect  
Analyses of treatment effect will be performed on both the EE and the PP P opulations.   
12.4.1.  Assessments  
Patients will be assessed as per the schedule of events . Response  status will be classified using  
disease -specific criteria as proposed by [CONTACT_37404]  [1] (Section  9.6 and 
Section 16.2).  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Primary Treatment Effect  Parameter  
The primary treatment effect parameter is the p roportion of responders at the RP2D  with the 
MYD88 L265 mutation . The definition of a responder is a patient who achieves a complete 
response (CR) or partial response (PR) based on the Revised Response Criteria for Malignant 
Lymphoma proposed by [CONTACT_3433] e International Working Group [1] (Section  9.6 and Section  16.2). 
As per the Simon two -stage design, after 10 subjects are treated at the RP2D until disease 
progression or clinical response, if one or fewer of those subjects respond, the study wil l end. If 
two or more of those initial 10 subjects respond, 19 more subjects will be enrolled. If six or more 
subjects of 29 treated at the RP2D respond, the null hypothesis that P response  ≤ 10% may be 
rejected.

Protocol 8400 -402, Version 4.0 29 Jan 2016  
 
Idera Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Confidential and Proprietary  [IP_ADDRESS].  Secondary Treatment Effect Parameter s 
The International Working Group specifies a number of outcome metric s related to time [1] 
(Section 16.3). The parameters considered most relevant to  this study  are: duration of response, 
time to response, proportion of responders at all dose levels, OS, and progression -free survival ; 
these will be analyzed both globally across all cohorts and by [CONTACT_15994] , reporting Kaplan -Meier 
estimated median , as well as the number of events and number of patients censored .  
12.5. Exploratory Analyses  
The following investigational factors will be analyzed with regard to response  status:  
 Presence or absence of  MYD 88 L265P  mutation in tumor cells . 
 Serum cytokine levels .  
 Serum  levels of antibody to IMO -8400 . 
12.6. Identification of Study Event Days and Times  
Study events will be recorded using the calendar date and (where applicable) the time to the 
nearest minute.  
For purposes of post -study analysis (e.g., tables and listings), study days will be designated as 
follows:  
 Day [ADDRESS_63686] treatment with  study drug.  
 The days prior to Day 1 are designated Day –1, Day –2, etc .; there is no Day 0.  
 The days following the day of the first treatment with study  drug are designated 
Day 2, Day  3, etc.  
 The day of the last treatment with study drug is indicated by [CONTACT_16050] "L", 
e.g., if the last treatment  is administered on Day 43, it will be displayed as "Day 
43L".  
 The days following the last treatment with study drug are designated Day  1P, Day 2P, 
etc.  
The times of events relat ed to dosing of study drug will be designated as minutes or hours before 
or after the time of dosing (i.e., the SC injection of study drug ), which is designated as 
t = 0 (zero). Thus, 15  minutes prior to dosing is t = –15 min; 2 hour afte r dosing is design ated 
t = [ADDRESS_63687] will be censored.  Rules for censoring of data 
will be described in th e SAP. 
Further details for handling of missing, duplicated or unscheduled data will be given in the SAP.  
12.9. Changes in the Planned Analyses  
If changes to the analyses planned in the protocol are made, then these will be liste d in the CSR , 
along with an explanation as to why they occurred.

Version 5.0, 14 June 2018   
Confidential  Page 40 of 111 7 PROCEDURES FOR REPORTING ADVERSE EVENTS 
7.1 Adverse Events Definitions 
The investigator will monitor the occurrence of AEs during the course of the study that will end 
with Visit 4.  
The following definitions of terms are guided by [CONTACT_120291] (21 CFR 312.32(a)) and are included here.  
Adverse event  is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient associated with the use of a drug 
in humans, whether or not considered drug related. 
Suspected adverse reaction means any adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility 
that the drug caused the adverse event. For the purposes of IND safety reporting, "reasonable 
possibility" means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the 
adverse ev ent. Suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than 
adverse reaction, which means any adverse event caused by a drug.  
Unexpected adverse event (adverse drug experience) or (suspected) adverse reaction means any 
adverse event  or (suspected) adverse reaction  that is not listed in the investigator brochure or is 
not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed. 
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” if, in the view of either the 
investigator or sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: Death, a life- threatening 
adverse event, inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], a persistent or 
significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect. Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -
threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical judgment, t hey may  jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. 
An adverse event is considered “life- threatening” if, in the view of either the investigator or 
sponsor, its occurrence place s the patient at immediate risk of death. It does not include an 
adverse event that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death. Suspected  Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R) is any (suspected) adverse reaction 
(any adverse even t for which there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the adverse 
event) that is both serious and unexpected. 
7.[ADDRESS_512276] and unintended response to a medical device, in this study, 
the camera/ imaging system.  This definition includes any event resulting from insufficiencies or 
inadequacies in the instructions for use or the deployment of the device, as well as any event that is the result of a user error [ISO 14 155-1:2003 (E) 3.1]. 
All ADEs noted during the study will be reported in the eCRF. 
On Target Laboratories, Inc. Protocol OTL -2016 -OTL38 -005 
Version 5.0, 14 June 2018   
Confidential  Page 41 of 111 [IP_ADDRESS]  Suspected Adverse Device Effect 
A suspected ADE is a subset of all ADEs for which there is a reasonable possibility (i.e. , evidence 
to suggest a causal relationship between the device and the ADE) that the device caused the event. 
Suspected ADE implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse device effect.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect 
An unanticipated ADE is any serious adverse effect on health or saf ety or any life -threatening 
problem or death caused by, or associated with, a device, if that effect, problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the investigational plan or application , or any other unant icipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to the 
rights, safety, or welfare of subjects [21 CFR 812.3 (s)]. 
7.[ADDRESS_512277] exposure to study drug. 
7.3.2 Laboratory Abnormalities 
To the extent possible, all clinically significant laboratory abnormalities observed during the 
course of the study will be included under a reported AE describing a clinical syndrome (e.g.,  elevated blood urea nitrogen and creatinine in the setting of an AE of “renal failure” or 
elevated ALT/AST in the setting of an AE of “hepatitis”).  In these cases (e.g., an AE of renal 
failure), the laboratory abnormality itself (e.g., elevated creatinine) does not need to be recorded 
as an AE.  
In the absence of a reported AE identifying a clinical syndrome that encompasses the observed clinically significant laboratory abnormality that “isolated” laboratory abnormality itself should 
be reported as an AE.  
Patients experiencing AEs or laboratory abnormalities will be assessed and appropriate evaluations performed until all parameters have returned to baseline levels, or are consistent with  
the patient’s then -current physical condition, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871].

Confidential  Page 42 of 111 7.3.3 Serious Adverse Events 
Instructions for reporting Serious Adverse Events (SAE) and Suspected Unexpected Serious 
Adverse Reactions (S[LOCATION_003]R) are found on P age 2. A written report of all SAEs that occur after 
the administration of study drug and during the study (ending with Visit 4) must be submitted to 
the IRB/ethics committe e (EC) and the Sponsor. SAEs/S[LOCATION_003]Rs  must be reported to the Sponsor 
within [ADDRESS_512278] be submitted to the IRB/EC in an annual report.  
7.3.[ADDRESS_512279] notify the Medical monitor (see Page  3 for details) within [ADDRESS_512280] be met.  
7.3.5 Disease Progression 
The progression of lung cancer (in patients diagnosed as such) per se will not constitute an AE. 
However, if the progression of the lung cancer meets the criteria for an SAE , then it should be 
reported  as an SAE ( see Page 2). 
1.1.[ADDRESS_512281] categorize the severity of each AE according to the following: 
• Mild: Awareness of signs or symptoms, but easily tolerated and are of minor irritant type. Symptoms do not require therapy or a medical evaluation; signs and symptoms are transient.  
• Moderate: Events introduce a low level of inconvenience or concern to the participant, but are usually improved by [CONTACT_14212]; moderate experiences may cause some interference with functioning

Confidential  Page 43 of 111 • Severe:  Events generally require systemic drug therapy or other treatment; they are 
usually incapacitating  
• Life-Threatening:  Risk of imminent death requiring immediate intervention.  
7.5 Classification of Adverse Events by [CONTACT_406284] t o the study drug administration will be assessed by [CONTACT_093]; 
after careful consideration , according to the following guidelines: 
Definitely Related: An adverse event that has a timely relationship to the administration of the 
study drug and follows a known pattern of response for which no alternative cause is present  
Probably Related: An adverse event that has a timely relationship to the administration of the 
study drug and follows a known pattern of response, but for which a potential alternative cause may be present  
Possibly Related: An adverse event that has a timely relationship to the administration of the study drug, follows no known pattern of response, but a potential alternative cause does not exist 
Not related: An adverse event for which  there is evidence that it is definitely related to a cause 
other than the study; in general, no timely relationship to the administration of the drug exists, or 
if so, the event does not follow a pattern of response and an alternative cause is present 
7.[ADDRESS_512282] report all unanticipated adverse devi ce effects to the IRB within  
10 calendar days of the initial receipt of information. On Target Laboratories or designee will report all unanticipated adverse device effects to the regulatory authorities and all investigators within 10 working days of the initial report of information.

* For the purposes of the initial IRB approval, the study has received institutional 
approval from [CONTACT_653527], Executive Dean of the Practice and Chair of the 
enterprise Mayo Clinic Clinical Practice Committee. This approval assumes that 
all Mayo Clini c surgical practices will participate in the study as an institutional 
priority, but provides that practice -level approvals will be formally solicited . To 
obtain these practice -level approvals, the principal investigators have been 
conducting metings wit h practice chairs, specialty councils, and allied health 
leadership. All IBR approvals have been obtained for clusters within tranche 1, and 
meetings have begun for subsequent tranches. Obtaining these approvals in 
advance will ensure that cascading commun ications can occur in a timely manner.

Page  8 of 47 5 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
5.1 Background on Condition, Disease, or Other Primary Study Focus  
Prescriptions for narcotic pain relief after surgery result in unintended prolonged 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_653435].1,2 That trend fuels an excess 
supply  of opi[INVESTIGATOR_653436], addiction, diversion, and overdoses 
on a national scale.3-10 Non-pharmacological pain care (NPPC) is effective and 
recommended by [CONTACT_653485] a more favorable 
risk-to-benefit ratio.11-14Additionally, patient and clinician decision support 
interventions are effective in encouraging  patient -centered and guideline -
concordant care in many other areas of medicine and hold great promise for 
promoting and facilitating  post-operative  non-pharmacologic  pain management .15,[ADDRESS_876892] been randomized to 
one of five different tranches to implement the intervention at staggered intervals  (one new 
cluster each wave, see diagram below).   
 
 
The primary outcome of the study is a composite of patient reported pain and function at 
three months  post-surgery . This will enable us to  determine the effectiveness of  a bundled 
NOHARM Healing after Surgery  Guide +  clinical decision support for promoting non -
pharmacological pain management strategies to patients  undergoing qualifying  surger ies, 
which may also  ultimately curb overall patient demand for opi[INVESTIGATOR_653437] -
acute post-surgical rehab  while optimizing functional recovery .  Thus, o ur secondary 
outcome(s) is  opi[INVESTIGATOR_653438] [ADDRESS_876893] of our EHR -embedded decision support intervention in an era where 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_653439] . 
All patients  receiving common , pre-defined  procedures within 7 surgical practice areas  at 6 
Mayo Clinic locations  will receive the study intervention if their surgery date coincides 
with the stepped wedge implementation schedule. Study locations include Mayo Clinic 
[COMPANY_002]ster, Mayo Clinic [LOCATION_012], and Mayo Clinic Arizona, as well as three Mayo Clinic 
Health System site s (Mankato, MN; La  Crosse, WI; and Eau Claire, WI).   Surgical practice 
areas will include orthopedic surgery, colorectal surgery, gyn surgery,  obstetrics , 
pulmonary/thoracic surgery, liver and kidney transplant, and cardiac surgery.  Due to 
variable combining  of post -op unit care  areas , practice size, and related consideration s we 
have formed [ADDRESS_876894] . Patient reported outcome  
measure s will include those collected in routine peri -operative care, as well as a limited 
number specific to the NOHARM trial; self -reported opi[INVESTIGATOR_653440].  
NOHARM  Protocol , Version 5.0 
Page  11 of 47 7 SELECTION AND ENROLLMENT OF PARTICIPANTS  
7.1 Inclusion Criteria  
All patients 18 years of age and older undergoing qualifying surgeries  at 
participating sites  will be eligible.  
7.2 Exclusion  Criteria  
None.  
7.3 Study Enrollment Procedures  
All eligible patients at participating sites will be enrolled in this minimal risk, 
population -based study. An automated EHR -based algorithm  will identify patients 
meeting inclusion criteria for the NOHARM study  based on  age, surgical 
procedure, clinical department , and location .  
Eligible patients in not -yet activated clusters  will receive usual care; data collected 
from this group will serve as “control” data in this stepped wedge study.  Control  
state data will be collected prior to cluster activation.   
All patients  scheduled for surgery ; as well as their care  surgical  team s, physical and 
occupational therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437], and unit nurses,  in activated practice clusters will be 
exposed to the intervention  per the randomization scheme . Because the intervention 
is embedded in the EHR, patients who are unable to interact with the portal -based 
Healing After Surgery Guide will not provide the data needed to populate and drive 
the EHR -based algorithms and clinical decision support tools. Therefore, these 
individuals will be less exposed to the intervention. However, the patients who do 
not interact with the Healing after Surgery  Guide  via the EHR patient portal  prior 
to their hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063] ` will have the opportunity to select NPPC modalities 
during their  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11298] , both pre - and post -operatively . By [CONTACT_653486] , their preferences will be enter ed into the 
EHR via flowsheets.  Subsequently, all EHR clinical decision support 
functionalities to encourage NPPC use will be operational for these patients.  
Cognitive limitations, lack of English fluency, or psychiatric illness may result in  
an inability to use the Healing After Surgery Guide which may also result in 
reduced exposure to the intervention.  
NOHARM  Protocol , Version 5.0 
Page  12 of 47 8 STUDY INTERVENTIONS  
8.1 Interventions, Administration, and Duration  
Once the NOHARM intervention is activated at a given participating site, patients 
undergoing qualifying surgical procedures will be exposed to the NOHARM  
intervention.  
The intervention includes:  
Healing after Surgery  Guide : 
The Healing after Surgery  Guide   is an interactive module in the Mayo Clinic 
patient portal (MyChart). Entry of an order for  their surgery will trigger  an EHR 
algorithm will automatically send a message to patients’ portals describing the need 
for an “individualized pain management plan to promote healing after surgery.” 
The portal message will provide a link allowing patients  to access  and engage with 
the HAS Guide  before their surgery. The HAS Guide  will encourage realistic 
expectations about post -surgica l pain, will educate patients on several evidence -
based, non -pharmacological pain management strategies (which are  robustly  
validated and endorsed in clinical guidelines), and will encourage patient s to select 
the NPPC modalities  that appeal to  them in managing post -acute pain during the 
months following their discharge. Patient selections elicited via the Healing After 
Surgery Guide  will prompt a follow -up portal message , acknowledging the 
patient’s NPPC selections and extend ing the opportunity for them to receive  a 
printed Healing After Surgery workbook  if they request  that such resources be 
mailed to them. Patients will have the opportunity to receive portal messages based 
on their responses to the Healing After Surgery Guide and PROMIS CAT (s tandard 
of care) as well as based on the length of time from surgery. These messages will 
include direction on how they can access the website, join Zoom support calls if 
desired or contact [CONTACT_653487]. Section 8.1.[ADDRESS_876895] patients with their selected modalities if they so wish. Patients will log 
into these calls anonymously and PHI will not be discussed. There will be calls that 
center a round specific modalities as well as open Q&A style.  
 
EHR -based Clinical Decision Support:  
The NPPC selections  will be stored in the EHR  and used to prompt perioperative 
clinician interactions , direct education delivered by [CONTACT_653488], inform modality 
choices during physical and occupational therapy sessions,  and populate patients’ 
pain management plans for controlling  pain following hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345] . 
Additionally, patients’ NPPC selection will be visible to cl inical providers on the 
Epic inpatient Summary view.  These components are considered standard of care.   
Mayo Education Material:  
A suite of self -management educational materials will be available to support 
patients ’ use of NPPC modalities and to help them trouble shoot and refine the use 
of their selected modalities.  These print materials and videos provide information 
NOHARM  Protocol , Version 5.[ADDRESS_876896] been developed, vetted 
and approved through Mayo Clinic’s Office of Patient Education processes and 
reflect existing standard of care for patient education. These materials will be 
available to patients via the Healing After Surgery website  
(healingaftersurgery.mayoclinic.org )and on Mayo Clinic Television.   Brief video 
descriptions of the NPPC modalities are imbedded in the Healing After Surgery 
Guide. The materials  include video and print resources , with the latter being  
available in both electronic and paper form ats.  The materials offer informational, 
instructional, and guided experiencial content for all NOHARM NPPC modalities, 
as appropriate.    A Healing After Surgery Workbook is also available .  The 
workbook  offers patients a location to record their experiences, concerns, and 
successes, as well as providing motivational messages.  
Patients may view the self-management educational  materials during their hospi[INVESTIGATOR_653441].  B ased on patients’ NPPC modality select ions, 
inpatient nurses will be prompted to  show patients how to navigate to the materials 
on Mayo Television , familiariz e them with the Healing After Surgery website , and 
provide them with print materials if desired .   Nurses will also use the educational 
materials to  discuss pain management planning with patients to refine their 
management plans following hospi[INVESTIGATOR_411609] .   
The materials will be available on a website, DVD, and Mayo Clinic TV.  Unit 
nurses will be able to give patients printed  PDFs, as required . Additionally, patients 
will receive a copy of the Healing After Surgery workbook via mail after they are 
enrolled onto the study . They will also have the ability to request from their portal 
messages that a print copy of the workbook be mailed to them .  
See Section 8.1.[ADDRESS_876897] distributed at the pre -operative consultation. This support is restricted to 
NPPC modalities and patients are clearly informed that any questions relating to 
medications and other an algesic approaches should be directed to their surgical care 
teams . This support is set up to maximize the patient’s successful self -management 
of the NPPC both pre and post operatively.NOHARM NPPC live  support will take 
to forms:  
 
1.  Toll free call for 1 -on-1 discussion of  individualized needs .[PHONE_13542]   
2. Presentations and group discussions via a virtual platform (Zoom technology) .

materials   
Clinical team decision support : 
Patient NPPC modality selection s elicited from the Healing After Surgery Guide  
will be converted to discrete data elements that will prompt clinician decision 
support (CDS)  after surgery . CDS tools that promote preference -sensitive, 
guideline -concordant NPPCs at defined touchpoints  on the perioperative care 
trajectory  will encourage clinicians , nurses , and physical/occupational therapi[INVESTIGATOR_653442] -populate fields  and functionalities

versions, the one time stamped earlier will be used for analysis.  
8.3 Concomitant Interventions  
This is a pragmatic, population -based clinical trial.  All eligible patients undergoing 
qualifying surgical procedures who receive care at the 6 participating sites will be 
enrolled, regardless of medications, treatment, supplements or other interventions 
they may be taking/receiving.   
8.3.1 Allowed Interventions  
The interventions in this study are a patient -facing “ Healing after Surgery  
Guide ” and a clinical team -facing clinical decision support augmented by 
[CONTACT_653489], vetted patient education materials already consistent with the 
scope of work for perioperative care.  These interventions could prompt 
utilization of NPPC modalities prior to, during , and after the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408].   
8.3.[ADDRESS_876901] -operative care processes, but this may not occur due to many competing 
demands , or patient preferences.   
Cognitive limitations, lack of English fluency, or psychiatric illness may result in 
inability to use the HAS Guide  or complete the  electronic patient reported outcome 
measures  (ePRO Ms). 
Interaction with the NOHARM HAS Guide , completion of ePRO Ms and utilization 
of NPPC modalities will be assessed by  [CONTACT_5586]-stamped links associated with the 
Healing after Surgery  Guide  while ePRO Ms and NPPC  modality  use will be 
extract ed from the medical record.

The figure below briefly summarize s the perioperative care pathway along which 
our bundled, EHR -based intervention will be implemented.   
 
 
9.2 Description of Evaluations  
9.2.1 Choosing Surgery and Pre-Operative Planning Touchpoints  
Touchpoint 1 - Choosing Surgery  
Ambulatory care team members prepare patients to engage with the 
NOHARM intervention (portal -based Healing after Surgery  Guide ) at the 
time surgery is scheduled.   
Touchpoint 2 – Pre-operative Planning  
Patients interact with the Healing after Surgery  Guide  via their Epic EHR 
MyChart portals.  The Healing after Surgery  Guide  will allow patients to 
select NPPC techniques that appeal to them  and develop an individualized 
NPPC plan.   Patients will be encouraged to familiarize themselves  with and 
practice NPPC modalities prior to their hospi[INVESTIGATOR_614] .  Additionally, 
they will be encouraged to obtain needed supplie s, engage their caregivers, 
and even schedule appointments with NPPC practitioners prior to their 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_653443] s may be 
seamlessly transitioned from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_653444]-acute  care 
setting.  
9.2.2 Inpatient Stay  Touchpoints  
Touchpoint 3 – Acute Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_653445]/occupational therapy staff will offer  patients the  
opportunity to receive preference -concordant NPPC modalities  during their 

NOHARM  Protocol , Version 5.0 
Page  17 of 47 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408] . For self -administered practices, staff will validate patients ’ 
preferences  and ensure the availability of needed supplies, instruction and 
ambient conditions (e.g. privacy).  
If patients are not experiencing adequate pain relief, they will be prompted 
by [CONTACT_653490][INVESTIGATOR_552216], and enhance clinician support for patients’ NPPC use.   
Additionally, NPPC nurse and physician specialists will be “on call” to 
assist unit nurse s, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437] , and members of the surgical care team in how 
to optimize the safety and effectiveness of NPPC modalities for specific 
patients.   
Touchpoint 4 – Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_653446], patients will be asked to revise their NPPC 
plan, as needed  based on their preferences and responses to specific NPPC 
modalities , and provided with support and resources. Discharge planning 
will include facilitation of continuation of patients’ NPPC use in their post -
acute care settings (e.g. home, rehabilitation facility, etc.). Patients will be 
given prescriptions to receive local NPPC, if available  and/or appropriate . 
Patients’ discharge summaries will be auto -populated with selection -
concordant NPPC instruction s and resources to find local NPPC providers.    
9.2.[ADDRESS_876903]-Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_653447] 5 – Remote Healing After Surgery Guide  Use and Post 
Operative Follow -up 
Patients will be encouraged to use the Healing After Surgery  and follow 
their individualized pain management plans during their post-surgical 
recovery . They  will be asked to report on  their pain intensity, anxiety, and 
limitations in physical function  using PROMIS ePROs  via the Epic 
MyChart patient portal .  Patients will , at the same time  points,  be asked 
which, if any, of the NPPC techniques they have used and at what 
frequency .  These measures will be collected at [ADDRESS_876904] surger y.  In addition, at the 3 month timepoint the patient will 
be asked to self-report  opi[INVESTIGATOR_653448].     
Include here which responses will trigger which messages.   
Additional Triggered Touchpoints  
Opi[INVESTIGATOR_653449] 3 -month postoperative interval will trigger  
messaging via the patient’s portal with  information regarding how to access  
resources to support their NPPC use.  Patients will be encouraged to utilize 
the live support resources, particularly the [ADDRESS_876905] and 
adapt use of modalities for optimal benfit.

Page  18 of 47 10 SAFETY ASSESSMENTS  
This is a minimal risk study. Participants are considered “enrolled” as soon as they meet 
study inclusion criteria and are automatically assigned  to receive study interventions and/or 
measurements.    
10.[ADDRESS_876906] 
far lower risk  profiles (almost zero risk) and greater benefit -to-risk ratio compared 
to usual  post-surgical pain management that involves opi[INVESTIGATOR_37007]. Patients 
whose pain cannot be sufficiently managed with non -pharmacological  pain 
management strategies will be supported by [CONTACT_653491] (with assistance 
from pain management  clinicians, as needed) using conventional pain management 
strategies.  
10.2 Methods and Timing for Assessing, Recording, and Analyzing Safety 
Parameters  
Our interventions are informational and logistical  and designed to enhance safe, 
patient -centered approaches to patient care.  If they were to prompt, for instance, 
less opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441], in theory, that could lead to worse function or increase pain.  That 
is why we chose the composite outcome measure of pain and physical function .  
Whether it is accurate to associate that “risk” to our intervention itself, versus the 
treatments prompted by [CONTACT_653492] a topic of debate.  Nevertheless, t his is a 
minimal r isk study. If we conservatively assume that downstream prescribing 
practices are attributable to our interventions, usual care (using opi[INVESTIGATOR_653450] a first line approach to pain management in the acute and post -acute recovery 
periods  following a surgical procedure s) introduces greater risk of dependency, 
addiction, and overdose, th an those posed by [CONTACT_653493].  
10.3 Adverse Events  and Serious Adverse Events  
Adverse Event (AE): Any untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence resulting 
unambiguously from the misuse or overuse of non -pharmacological pain 
management strategies facilitated by [CONTACT_25234]. All untoward or unfavorable 
medical occurrences will be first assumed to be  associated with the patient ’s 
surgery. Untoward or unfavorable medical occurrences will be deemed an adverse 
event only if they can be clearly associated with use of non -pharmacological pain 
management strategies recommended and/or fac ilitated by [CONTACT_653494], under any circumstances, have otherwise happened.  
Serious Adverse Event (SAE ): Any adverse event unambiguously associated with 
the intervention that: 
• Results in death  
NOHARM  Protocol , Version 5.0 
Page  19 of 47 • Is life threatening, or places the participant at immediate risk of death from 
the event as it occurred  
• Requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
• Causes persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• Results in congenital anomalies or birth defects  
• Is another condition which investigators judge to represent significant 
hazards  
There are no laboratory or other clinical values which may be used to assess safety 
concerns related to the intervention. Patient reported pain, requests for assistance 
with pain management, and other health outcomes, while measurable , are 
associated with the patient’s surgical procedure  and will be gather as part of the 
ultimate outcome data.  If patients were to experience a paradoxical response to a 
modality –massage , for example  – those effects would likely be transient and they 
would have access to all  the usual care resources of Mayo Clinic as any other 
patient should those symptoms persist.  
Adverse events that may be anticipated in the study involve any patient misuse or 
overuse of non -pharmacological pain management strategies. Patients who elect to 
incorporate non -pharmacological pain management strategies in their recovery 
from surgery will be instructed in the use of those strategies, including whether 
(and when) th e use of those strategies is appropriate in their situation.  
Because non -pharmacological pain management modalities recommended by [CONTACT_653495], they will be monitored by [CONTACT_102]’s surgical team as a 
part of usual post -acute ca re. Therefore , we will not actively review for potential  
events with scheduled promptings.  
Unprompted adverse events are possible, but not expected. Surgical teams will 
inform the study  team  if they are made aware of any untoward medical occurrence 
that could reasonably be attributed to a patient ’s misuse or overuse of non -
pharmacological pain strategies as a direct result of the facilitation provided by [CONTACT_653496].  Such events are highly unlikely, and the risks of such 
events leading to unfavorable outcomes is almost non -existent. Th e risks of 
participant cooperation in the NOHARM intervention is far less than the risks of 
usual care which  often  involve opi[INVESTIGATOR_653451] -acute 
recovery periods.  
10.3.1  Reporting Procedures  
An AE or SAE will be suspected if a member of the patient’s surgical team 
or any member of the study team who interfaces with the patient for any 
reasons suspects that  a patient is experiencing a medical issue that is 
unambiguously related to the patient’s interaction with the NOHARM 
intervention.  
NOHARM  Protocol , Version 5.0 
Page  20 of 47 The principal investigator, relevant study team members, and any relevant 
members of the surgical team will adjudicate the relevance of the patient’s 
experience to the NOHARM intervention (versus an anticipated result of 
the patient’s surgical procedure).  
If a patient experience or outcome is determined to be an AE or SAE by 
[CONTACT_653497], then that patient’s experience will be documented and 
reported per institutional procedures. The surgical team and/or members of 
the study team with expertise in po st-surgical pain management will follow 
up with that patient to ensure that appropriate steps are taken to mitigate any 
negative outcomes and ensure that the patient is properly informed and 
educated about safe use of non -pharmacological pain management 
strategies for the remainder of their surgical recovery.  
Severity of the Event  
All AEs will be assessed by a qualified medical professional using a 
protocol defined grading system.   
Mild – Events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the 
participant’s daily activities.  
Moderate – Events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern with 
the therapeutic measures. Moderate events may cause some interference 
with functioning.  
Severe – Events interrupt a participant’s usual daily activity and may 
require systemic drug therapy or other treatment. Severe events are usually 
potentially life -threatening or incapacitating.  Of note, the term “severe” 
does not necessarily equate to “s erious”.  
Relationship to the Study Intervention  
Because this is a minimal risk study  and the intervention may be construed 
as less risky than usual care, it would be inappropriate to regard the study 
intervention as suspect, by [CONTACT_15094], for all medical occurrences in the 
perioperative period. For this reason, the principal investigator, c linical 
experts on the study team, and the patient’s surgical team will adjudicate the 
relevance of patient events outcom es in a binary fashion:  
• Not related to the NOHARM intervention. This will be the 
presumption, unless proven otherwise. Patients may be expected to 
have many challenges to overcome following a surgical procedure. 
These challenges are unrelated to the intervention.  
• Related to the NOHARM intervention. The study team will evaluate 
all occurrences suspected of being associated unambiguously with the 
NOHARM intervention and adjudicate their relevance. We do not 
expect any AEs or SAEs to result from the NOHARM interventio n. 
NOHARM  Protocol , Version 5.0 
Page  21 of 47 10.3.2  Follow-up for Adverse Events  
Patient events suspected of being AEs or SAEs will be addressed 
immediately by [CONTACT_079], relevant experts on the study 
team, and/or the patient’s surgical team. Upon determination that an event is 
indeed an AE or SAE, appropriate actions will be taken, including 
contact[CONTACT_653498].  
All events suspected of being AE will be documented, and documentation 
for recorded events subsequently determined to be an AE or SAE will be 
updated. All AEs and SAEs will be followed to adequate resolution.  
The study coordinator will record all events reportable by [CONTACT_653499] o ccurring any time following patient enrollment and limited to the 
last data collection point in the study.  All events are expected to occur in the 
acute or early post -acute periods of recovery.

Page  22 of 47 11 INTERVENTION DISCONTINUATION  
This study is a pragmatic clinical trial, and as such, patients will not be individually 
consented. However, voluntariness is preserved as patients and surgical team s are not 
required to engage with any component of the intervention  they are not interested in or 
deem irrelevant to their care.  Additionally, as a pragmatic clinical trial, “the intervention” 
will be systematically implemented  at the surgical practice level , per the stepped -wedge 
schedule, as an element of usual care.  
Therefore, discontinuation of the study, whether for an individual participant

by [CONTACT_653501] .  The discontinuation of the study intervention components, if 
merited, will be at the discretion of the surgical specialties  in conjunction with the DSMB;  
discontinuation  is not anticipated.  
Removal individual  patient s from the trial will be functionally achieved  in the following 
situations:  
• The patient actively requests to have their records withdrawn  from the NOHARM 
study  dataset . This is unlikely, as patients will only know of NOHARM as a 
practice -based care initiative per the pragmatic design of the trial.  
• Patients previously indicating their unwillingness to have medical record data used 
for research purposes will have their records redacted from final study datasets prior 
to analysis.   
Cessation of study measurement will happen for the entire trial in the event that:  
• Institutional needs / priorities preclude our ability to conduct study procedures (e.g. 
in the case of institutional response to COVID -19).  
• The study funder requests that study activities cease.  
In the event that an individual patient withdraws from the study or the entire study ceases, 
patients will still be monitored by [CONTACT_653502] -acute recover y period. Cessation of study procedures will not impact 
patients ’ access to  standard  supportive care following surgery.  
NOHARM  Protocol , Version 5.0 
Page  23 of 47 12 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
12.1 General Design Issues  
This study will address the primary objective using a cluster randomized stepped 
wedge design. Surgical practices, or clusters, will be randomized in 5 tranches to 
receive the NOHARM intervention; outcomes of patients treated by [CONTACT_653503]. The primary statistical 
hypothesis is that pain and function measures will be lower and higher, 
respectively, in the patients treat ed under the intervention  conditions , when 
compared with non -intervention patients  in those same practices .  
The cluster randomized stepped -wedge design will allow us to stagger the 
NOHARM implementation while increasing statistical power. The alternative to 
staggering the implementation would be to implement at all sites at the same time, 
which is impractical fr om a resource  perspective. The stepped -wedge design allows 
each site to serve as its own control, reducing the bias due to imbalanced risk 
factors across clusters. Contamination does pose some threat to the internal validity 
of stepped wedge designs when, as here, the intervention rolls out sequentially in 
adjacent clusters.  The 22 NOHARM clusters will minimize potential 
contamination by [CONTACT_7092][INVESTIGATOR_653452] t buildings in some cases, as 
well as subspecialty -designated inpatient wards, office suites, etc.   
The primary hypothesis is that the NOHARM intervention will reduce patient 
reported pain and increase patient reported function following designated surgical 
procedures relative to patients treated under usual care. The primary outcome  – a 
composite of patient reported pain and function – [ADDRESS_876908] -operatively will be 
assessed using validated patient reported outcomes.  
12.2 Sample Size and Randomization  
Using pain data for 6,261 patients with these procedures at six sites, we estimated 
the intra-cluster correlation coefficient  (ICC) for the pain score to be  modest   = 
0.037.  To assess minimal detectable effects, we simulated a large number of  
randomizations and estimated the detectable effect for each. Specifically, for P = 
1,….,5000 permutations, the 22 clusters were randomly assigned to 5 waves. For 
each permutation, the closed form solution of Harrison et al (2019) was used to 
estimate SE(Q ) (derived from the formula of Hussey, Hughes (2008)) for true 
effect Q. We used the values 2 = 1 and 2 = 0.[ADDRESS_876909] ranged between 
0.048SD and 0.055SD.  
12.2.1  Treatment Assignment Procedures  
In order to balance cluster characteristics , we applied a constrained 
randomization  procedure. Constrained randomization allows us to balance a 
larger number of cluster characteristics than is possible through 
NOHARM  Protocol , Version 5.0 
Page  24 of 47 stratification. Here the key cluster characteristics to be balanced were: site 
(6 locations), volume (estimated using 2018 data), procedures (3 groups), 
and number of teams (1 -4). Given only [ADDRESS_876910] an allocation of sites to waves from among a set of allocations that 
has better balance on these factors.  
Specifically, we generated 100,000 allocations of the 22 clusters to 5 waves. 
For each allocation, we then calculated a balance metric B as follows. For 
each characteristic c listed above, let X(c) i be the value of c for each cluster 
i=1,...,22. For categorical factors X is an indicator, for volume and number 
of teams X is a number, rescaled to range from 0 -1. Let w=0,...,5 be the 
baseline  (w=0) and 5 intervention waves; and for a given allocation, let S i = 
the first wave at which cluster i is allocated to  intervention. Then we 
calculate for each allocation the balance metric  
𝐵=∑ (𝑆𝑖̅−𝑤)|∑𝑋(𝑐)𝑖(𝑆𝑖≤𝑤)
𝑐−∑𝑋(𝑐)𝑖(𝑆𝑖>𝑤)
𝑐|
𝑤=0.,,[ADDRESS_876911] decile; we then selected one allocation randomly 
from those 10,000 ‘acceptable’ allocations.  This process resulted in a full 
allocation of all [ADDRESS_876912] of the DSMB or if necessitated by 
[CONTACT_653504] (e .g. loss of a study site). Similarly, there  are 
no pre -specified stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_653453] . 
12.4 Outcomes  
Outcomes will be collected via the Epic EHR . PROMs will be collected using 
interfaces available to patients in their MyChart patient portals  or the Welcome 
tablet functionality at point of care  as available .   Because outcomes will be either 
PROMs or data entered by [CONTACT_653505], requirements for 
adjudication will be minimal.  Health care utilization is an exception in that criteria 
for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_653454].  The 
NOHARM Data Management  working group will identify hospi[INVESTIGATOR_653455], including ER stays that exceed 24 hours.  A  committee  
blinded to a patient’s affiliation with an activated  or control cluster will determine 
whether to design ate such instances as hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602].  
The cadence and mode of  PROM data collection are outlined below .  PROMs 
comprise the NOHARM trial’s co-primary and a majority of its secondary 
outcomes .  PROMs will additionally be collected for use in describing  the study 
population and for analytic adjustment s. 
NOHARM  Protocol , Version 5.0 
Page  25 of 47  
12.4.1  Primary outcome   
Physical function and pain interference, as measured with the Patient 
Reported Outcome Measurement System (PROMIS) computer adaptive 
tests (CATs)  are the co -primary outcomes .  The CATs in the Mayo Clinic 
Epic EHR have been parameterized with stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_653456]  a standard error of measurement -defined  
threshold.  IRT-based instruments have generally better discrimination 
across the entire trait range than legacy PRO Ms,19,[ADDRESS_876913] been validated in the target populations.23-25   The 
PROMIS physical function and pain interference CATs will be assigned via 
an automated Epic function precisely 3 months following each patient’s 
surgery.  Patients will receive an automated  reminder message  via their 
patient portals  prompting them  to complete the PROMs.  
Because post -operative visit requirements and sequences vary across 
surgical practices, administration of the PROMIS CATs will not be linked 
to a specific visit, but rather assigned automatically after [ADDRESS_876914] ed from the medication 
administration log in the EHR.  As in previous work,  26-28  parenteral, 
transdermal, and oral opi[INVESTIGATOR_653457] (OMEs). Second, oral and transdermal o pi[INVESTIGATOR_653458] a Mayo Clinic provider at the time of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_653459] [ADDRESS_876915] ed and expressed as count data.  Second, p atients ’ use 
of NPPC modalities will be assessed using self -report.  At the 1-, 2- and 3-
month  assessment point patients will be queried regarding which of the 
NOHARM NPPC modalities they have used since hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345] .  The 
will be presented with a list of the NOHARM m odalities and asked to 
indicate those that they have used .  Epic cascading logic will then present a 
second item for each modality that a patient has used which will ask them 
“How many times per week, on average, do you use modality ?” Healthcare 
utilization for NOHARM will consider hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], post -acute care, ED 
visits, surgery clinic outpatient visits, and calls to the surgery care team and 
post-acute care (PAC).  EHR entries and administrative billing data will be 
aggregated to  construct a comprehe nsive data set of all clinical encounters.  
Data collected for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_653460].  For ED encounters, we will capture diagnoses and 
procedures.  Clinic visits will be captured using billing data which will 
include CPT codes, ICD -[ADDRESS_876916] errors for t -tests and χ2-tests, and mixed effects models.  Patient 
characteristics will be summarized by [CONTACT_475405], and tested for difference 
between intervention groups; any factors which are imbalanced will be accounted 
for in the main analyses.  Factors assessed for balance and potential inclusion in 
pre-specified  analyses are those listed in Section 13.1 .1 and all baseline measures 
listed in 13.1.2.  
The primary and secondary outcomes will be compared between intervention 
groups using mixed effects generalized linear models. Each model will include an 
indicator for intervention group; a random intercept for cluster; cluster level factors 
that were used  to constrain randomization; calendar time; surgery type; and any 
patient factors that were imbalanced across groups.  
The model details for each outcome are as follows:  
1. PROMIS CATs (anxiety (1°), physical function (1°), pain  (1°)). These are 
continuous measures, collected at two time points, pre -operative and [ADDRESS_876917] of the intervention on these we will 
estimate three separate models. If Yijt is the measure at time t =1,2 of the ith 
patien t treated by [CONTACT_653506], then we will estimate  
𝑌𝑖𝑗2=𝛽0+𝛽𝐼𝐼𝑖𝑗+𝛽𝐵𝑌𝑖𝑗0+𝛽𝑇𝑇+𝚩𝑿 𝑿𝒊𝒋+𝚩𝒁𝒁𝒋+𝑢𝑗+𝑒𝑖𝑗   (1) 
 
NOHARM  Protocol , Version 5.0 
Page  27 of 47 where Iij indicates the intervention status, T is calendar time, u j ~ N(0, 2) is a 
cluster level random effect, Xij is a vector of patient characteristics, including 
surgery type, Zj is a vector of cluster characteristics used for randomization, and 
eij is a residual error. By [CONTACT_6310] I = [ADDRESS_876918] -operative. We will sum these to 
create a score, and use a model similar to (1) but without a baseline value Y ij0:  
𝑌𝑖𝑗=𝛽0+𝛽𝐼𝐼𝑖𝑗+𝛽𝑇𝑇+𝚩𝑿 𝑿𝒊𝒋+𝚩𝒁𝒁𝒋+𝑢𝑗+𝑒𝑖𝑗   (2) 
Again by [CONTACT_6310] I = 0 we can assess whether the intervention is associated with 
changes in the corresponding measure.  
3.  Opi[INVESTIGATOR_653461] 4 outcomes:   
a.      Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] -based consumption, daily oral morphine equivalents (OMEs). 
This is a continuous measure for each day of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; we will 
assume that this depends in part on the day post surgery, D ij and model  
 
𝑌𝑖𝑗=𝛽0+𝛽𝐼𝐼𝑖𝑗+𝛽𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑗+𝛽𝑇𝑇+𝚩𝑿 𝑿𝒊𝒋+𝚩𝒁𝒁𝒋+𝑢𝑗+𝑒𝑖𝑗   (3) 
 
For this model we will consider D ij as first continuous and then as 
categorical.   
 
b.      Discharge and post -discharge prescriptions, daily oral morphine 
equivalents (OMEs). For this outcome, we will use a model analogous to 
(3), where D ij is replaced by [CONTACT_653507].  
 
c.      Number of post -discharge prescriptions. These are counts for the [ADDRESS_876919] of the intervention will be assessed 
using a model similar to (2) but with a Poisson link function:  
 
 
𝑙𝑛(𝐸(𝑌𝑖𝑗)) ~ 𝛽0+𝛽𝐼𝐼𝑖𝑗+𝛽𝑇𝑇+𝚩𝑿 𝑿𝒊𝒋+𝚩𝒁𝒁𝒋+𝑢𝑗+𝑒𝑖𝑗   (4) 
𝑌𝑖𝑗~ 𝑃𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑜𝑛 (𝜇) 
 
 We will assess the distribution first using an empty model, and potentially 
adopt a zero inflated Poisson, negative binomial, or zero inflated negative 
binomial according to the corresponding AIC values.  
 
d.      Daily use of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]; this is binary outcome collected one time, at [ADDRESS_876920] of the intervention we will use a 
model similar to (4) but with a logit link:  
 
NOHARM  Protocol , Version 5.0 
Page  28 of 47 𝑙𝑜𝑔𝑖𝑡 (𝑌𝑖𝑗) ~ 𝛽0+𝛽𝐼𝐼𝑖𝑗+𝛽𝑇𝑇+𝚩𝑿 𝑿𝒊𝒋+𝚩𝒁𝒁𝒋+𝑢𝑗+𝑒𝑖𝑗   (5) 
 
For a -d we can again test I = [ADDRESS_876921] of the 
intervention using a model similar to (4) above. As with (4), we will compare 
model specifications using an empty model first to determine the best count 
family (Poisson, negati ve binomial, zero inflated or not) using AIC, then apply 
that in the final model.  
12.6 Subgroup analyses  
12.6.1  Clinical and Demographic subgroups  
Subgroup analyses will be performed for a) separate procedures  b) separate age 
groups  c) separate genders and d) separate racial/ethnic groups.  Patients will be 
stratified using each classifier and the primary analyses replicated in each 
subgroup.  
12.6.2  Patients at risk of u nplanned prolonged opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441] (UPOU).   
Hypothesis: P atients at moderate to high risk for  UPOU , defined by [CONTACT_653508], pre-operative opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441], and/or chronic 
pain will use NPPC modalities significantly less frequently than patients 
who are at low risk of UPOU.   
Self-reported use of NPPC, expressed as a binary (Yes/No) response and 
assessed at [ADDRESS_876922] -surgical time point, will be compared between 
patient subgroups stratified by [CONTACT_653509].   
12.6.3  Patients who are r urally situated.  
Hypothesis. Patients who are rurally situated , as defined by [CONTACT_653510], will use NPPC modalities significantly less frequently than 
patients who are situated in urbanized areas and urban clusters .   
Self-reported use of NPPC, expressed as a binary (Yes/No) response and 
assessed at [ADDRESS_876923] -surgical time point, will be compared across  
patient subgroups defined by [CONTACT_653511]/rural criteria . 
 
NOHARM  Protocol , Version 5.0 
Page  29 of 47 12.7 Supplementary Analyses  
12.7.1  Moderators  
In supplementary analyses we will assess whether procedure, age, sex, or 
race/ethnicity moderate the intervention effect. The models (1) -(5) used in the 
primary analysis will be expanded to include indictors for one of these subgroup 
classifiers, as well as the interaction with interventio n status. By [CONTACT_653512], we can assess whether these factors moderate 
the intervention.  
12.7.[ADDRESS_876924] of the intervention on the separate outcomes. We will adapt 
models (1) -(5) to path analysis, a type of structural equation model, which will 
allow us to spe cify an indirect effect (of the intervention through the potential 
mediator) and test whether it is non -zero.  
NOHARM  Protocol , Version 5.[ADDRESS_876925]. In addition to demographic,  diagnostic, 
and procedural clinical variables, this includes patient reported outcomes and 
medication information that are captured electronically from patients as part of 
routine (i.e. usual) perioperative care at Mayo Clinic.  
13.1.1  Clinical and Demographic variables  
• Age 
• Sex 
• Race/ethnicity  
• Insurance  status

• Zip code of residence (for classification as rural or non -rural residence)  
• Comorbidities  
▪ Elixhauser comorbidity index  
13.1.2  Treatment and outcomes variables  
The following items will be captured in addition to clinical and demographic 
variables:  
• Patient Reported Medical Information System (PROMIS) computer adaptive

Data will be programmatically extract ed and curated by [CONTACT_38991], 
including data managers, analysts, and/or statisticians. All data will exist prior to 
the time of access, and no further patient contact [CONTACT_653513].  
Once extracted from the E HR, data will be maintained on secure, encrypted, 
password protected research servers at Mayo Clinic. Access to data files will be 
restricted to individuals listed in the protocol approved by [CONTACT_68275].  
13.[ADDRESS_876930] (specifically MC [COMPANY_002]ster, MC Arizona, 
MC Jacksonville, MC La  Crosse, MC Mankato,  and MC Eau Claire) will not be 
required to conduct any site - or study -specific, manual data collection. All study 
sites use a unified electronic medical record ( Epic) and programmatic data 
extract ion can be conducted by [CONTACT_653514] 
(MC [COMPANY_002]ster).  
The coordinating center (MC [COMPANY_002]ster) will extract  data from the electronic 
medical record as need ed to assess the fidelity of routine data collection activities, 
evaluate the completeness of data collection, and to conduct comprehensive data 
pulls for the final analysis.  
Data collection forms are not  applicable to our study design as all data will be 
recorded  as part of usual care and electronically retrieved from the medical record 
by [CONTACT_464].  
13.[ADDRESS_876931]. Chart -audit will occur at 3 -month intervals, on 2 -5%, 
depending on capacity, of patients for each of the most recently activated 
clusters. These audits are intended to insure that data extraction pr ocedures 
are functioning as expected for each cluster.    
NOHARM  Protocol , Version 5.[ADDRESS_876932] the EHR as 
needed.  
13.3.4  Protocol Deviations  
Protocol deviations will be reported promptly to the Mayo Clinic IRB  upon 
the study team being made aware of the deviations . The main opportunity 
for protocol deviation s is the mis -routing of patients to wrong study arm 
(intervention or control). Care will be taken to make sure the EHR 
assignment  algorithms are functioning properly. Protocol modifications will 
be made as new tranches are brought into the intervention arm of the study.  
The following are examples of potential protocol deviations which will be 
carefully avoided, but reported if they occur:  
1. Implementing the intervention without practice approvals.  
As indicated in the protocol and elsewhere , we will be engaging with 
practice leadership in advance of implementing the NOHARM intervention. 
Failure to duly engage practice leadership and obtain documented approval 
prior to implementing the intervention in specific surgical practices would 
violate expectations set in the protocol.  
2. Incorrect routing of patients to intervention/control arms.  
Patient assignment to either the treatment or control arm of the study  within 
the EHR  will be done via pre-specified algorithm s. Rigorous testing and 
validation will be done to ensure the algorithms are functioning as expected. 
Should th e algorithm s fail to properly assign patients to the treatment or 
control arm of the study , appropriate action will be taken to refine the 
algorithms to prevent further mis -assignment and  the affected patients will 
be accounted for , as appropriate , in the study analys es. 
3. Failure to monitor trial for data quality and patient safety.  
Per the protocol, we will monitor study implementation —particularly 
within the surgical practices in which the NOHARM intervention has been 
implemented —to ensure that the intervention is functioning as 
designed/intended and that critical data points are being captured. Further , 
the protocol assumes that data essential for monitoring patient safety and 
ensuring data quality will be abstracted as needed and made available to the 
data safety and monitoring board for review.  
4. Study staff not included in IRB documentation.  
All personnel on the study who will be involved with the conduct of the 
research  must be included in IRB documentation per Mayo Clinic policy. 
This excludes members who are involved with NOHARM as Standard of 
NOHARM  Protocol , Version 5.[ADDRESS_876933] materials, including elements 
of the decision aid, after visit summaries, and resource materials provided to 
patients will be updated with alternate and or additional information 
throughout the course of the study. Failure to apprise the IRB of these 
modifications and/or to document these updates as potentially important 
covariates in analysis will be considered a deviation from protocol.  
13.3.5  Monitoring  
The study will be monitored by [CONTACT_653515] a manner and frequency 
prescribe d by [CONTACT_45455] /NIH . 
NOHARM  Protocol , Version 5.[ADDRESS_876934] (IRB) Review  
This protocol and any subsequent modifications will be reviewed and approved by 
[CONTACT_68275].  
14.2 Informed Consent Forms  & Authorization Considerations  
A waiver of informed consent is being requested for this study, which presents no 
more than minimal risk of harm to subjects. Because this is a population -based, 
EHR -embedded study, it is not practical to conduct the research without the waiver 
of consent. We do not feel the w aiver of informed consent will adversely affect the 
rights or welfare of the subjects.    
In lieu of consent, we have sought out and confirmed Mayo Clinic Practice 
leadership support for the trial.  In the [ADDRESS_876935] of trial 
implementation we will confirm each individual practices ’ willingness to 
participate in the trial.  Because some practices will not be randomized until 2023, 
securing their endorsement now, did not make sense.   
See Section 1 5 – Ethical Considerations for more information.  
14.3 Participant Confidentiality  
Information about study subjects will be kept confidential.  
Only NOHARM study team members (study investigators, project coordinators, 
research assistants, data managers, biostatisticians, etc.) who are IRB -approved 
study staff will have access to individually identifiable private information 
collected for study purposes, except as necessary for monitoring, audits and/or 
inspections by [CONTACT_1201], the NIA, and/or government regulatory agencies.  
Data that are transferred outside of the M ayo Clinic firewall will be de -identified, 
stripped of personal health information, and encrypted.  
14.4 Study Discontinuation  
The study may be discontinued at any time by [CONTACT_54852], the IRB, 
the NIA, the DSMB, or other government agencies as part of their duties to ensure 
that research participants are protected.  
NOHARM  Protocol , Version 5.0 
Page  35 of 47 15 ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
This is a population -based study, where all eligible patients undergoing qualifying 
surgeries at participating Mayo Clinic locations will be “enrolled .” Neither current 
regulations, nor the peer -reviewed literature explicitly defines when a formal patient 
consent process is required for pragmatic clinical trials, particularly when testing the 
implementation of proven -effective interventions at scale. This  type of research, sometimes 
referred to as “standard of care” research, in which the primary research o bjective is to 
implement and evaluate a strategy that better satisfies the existing clinical standard of care, 
has been debated in recent high -profile cases.70-[ADDRESS_876936] of care researc h in which the marginal incremental 
risks of the proposed interventions do not foreseeably introduce even incremental net risk 
to individuals in the participating practices being studied. The M ayo Clinic IRB has been 
an active partner in developi[INVESTIGATOR_653466].  Preliminary discussion s with  the M ayo Clinic IRB executive committee in 
January 2020 concluded this study is minimal risk and that waiver of consent was 
warranted so long as practice endorsement was secur ed.  
IRB members and the M ayo Clinic Family Advisory Council contributed to the current 
NOHARM “Transparency Promotion and Patient Preference Protection Plan.” The 
Transparency Promotion and Patient Preference Protection Plan is a multi -pronged 
approach that was in place prior to planning an d design of the NOHARM trial, but that has 
further matured as a consequence of these efforts. The M ayo Clinic Enterprise, in an effort 
to proactively anticipate ethics, human subject protections, and institutional oversight 
concerns related to the conduct of quality improvement, pragmatic, and “standard of care” 
trials convened a group of key stakeholders. These stakeholders include members of the 
Mayo Clinic IRB, M ayo Clinic Patient and Family Advisory Council, representatives from 
Enterprise Research Administration, and clinicians representing surgical specialties, pain 
management, pharmacy, rehabilitation medicine, and general internal medicine. This 
stakeholder group is en trusted to provide impartial oversight of trial activities that may 
challenge the g oal of complete pan -stakeholder transparency and prioritization of patient 
preference.  
NOHARM  Protocol , Version 5.[ADDRESS_876937] Workgroups/Responsibilities

• Mayo Clinic Leadership  
While the NOHARM intervention is designed to seamlessly integrate into 
clinical practice and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_653468], meaningful stakeholder engagement 
and collaboration is critical to successful implementation.  The project team 
seeks endorsement from Mayo Cli nic leaders and practice partners through 
the established committee structure including:  
o Mayo Clinic Clinical Practice Committee  
o Opi[INVESTIGATOR_653469]  
o Mayo Clinic Nursing Practice Council  
o EHR/RMC Oversight Committee  
o Surgical and Procedural Committee  
o Surgical Specialty Councils  
NOHARM  Protocol , Version 5.[ADDRESS_876938], we foresee a number of manuscript and 
presentation opportunities. We will publish rigorous visible results in quality journals.  
Mayo Clinic ’s office of Scientific Publications also supports investigators in developi[INVESTIGATOR_653470], chapters, and complete books for academic publication. Additionally, the 
Mayo Clinic College of Medicine supports the development of educational content 
through out its five schools, ensuring that new, groundbreaking ideas are quickly spread to 
learners at nearly every level of medical education. Importantly, new education spreads 
beyond our own doors in numerous ways. Especially important is the Mayo School of 
Continuous Professional Development, accredited by [CONTACT_653516].

Page  43 of 47 Appendix A: Clinician Participants  
 
 
Clinician Participants  
The clinical practice s of care teams involved in the care of surgery patients targeted by [CONTACT_653496] —including surgeons, nurses, physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437], pain management 
specialists —will be impacted by [CONTACT_653518]. In the course of providing 
care to surgical patients in active intervention clusters, clinicians will be alerted  to non-
pharmacological pain management strategies  (via CDS tools embedded in the EHR ) for which 
patients have expressed preference . Within their routine wo rkflows  (i.e. interface with patients) , 
clinicians will be prompted to engage patients about their preferred post-acute pain 
management strateg ies. 
 
Because of this practice impact, clinicians will be considered  “participants” in the NOHARM 
pragmatic trial (in the same way as they have been construed in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_653477]# 20 -
001864).  This determination has  been affirmed by [CONTACT_653519] 
(January 2020 meeting) . 
 
Accrual  
Based on data from 2018 on the 22 surgery types targeted by [CONTACT_653520] (minus neuro / 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_653478] – IRB# 20-001864 ) we estimate 
there to be approximately 225 surgeons in the enterprise who are routinely performing surgery. 
We will inflate this number to 300 to account for physicians performing one of the target surgery 
types less frequently. To this figure, we will add 0.5 residents / and 0.5 physician assistants per 
surgeon (+300). Assuming a median hosp ital stay of 3 days (9 nursing shift changes), we will 
add 9 nurses X 300 surgeons ([PHONE_13544]). Finally, assuming 0.[ADDRESS_876942] per surgeon, we will add 210 clinicians . This brings our total 
estimated clinician accrual to 3510 participants.  
 
Consent  and Data Collection  
 
1. Given the ubiquity of the intervention and the volume of clinicians touched by  [CONTACT_653521].  
2. Clinician “consent” will be granted in the form of “ whole practice  consent” granted by 
[CONTACT_653522] a pre -requisite for 
implementation in specific surgical practices.  
3. It would be impracticable to  formal ly track  clinicians  as we are not documenting 
individual consent nor collecting data  from clinicians . Although we could potentially 
identify the number of clinicians who log into Epic to provide care for discreet surgery 
patients, this approach would be imprecise.  
4. No clinician variables —including clinician ordering or prescribing behaviors —are being 
assessed. All study outcomes are patient outcomes, as the intervention is intended to 
guide the patient’s surgical recovery experience.  
 
Risks and Benefits  
The risks to clinicians involved in the NOHARM  trial are minimal. Clinicians are  already 
motivated  to employ clinical guidelines for non -pharmacological pain management, and the 
NOHARM pi[INVESTIGATOR_653479]. Clinicians may find , 
perhaps at first,  that the EHR -based prompts interfere with the rhythms of their workflow, but 
NOHARM  Protocol , Version 5.[ADDRESS_876943] -surgical pain . Ongoing c are will be taken to minimize 
the workflow  burden while making the  EHR  prompts an effective tool in promoting institutional 
adherence to clinical guidelines.  Clinicians will always be  able to make professional judgments 
about the appropriateness of engaging patients in specific conversations about pain 
management throughout the patients ’ post-surgical recovery. Clinicians may freely disregard 
EHR -prompts as they deem appropriate in their professional judgment.  Clinicians will be amply 
supported by [CONTACT_653523] -pharmacological pain management modalities and in the management of 
complex pain management cases.

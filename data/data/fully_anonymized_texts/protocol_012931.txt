InSight  is superior to the unaided reader for detecting actionable lung nodules.  
The secondary objective of this clinical study is to prove that the reader’s read ing time is not 
significantly increased when aided with ClearRead CT Insight.  
2.[ADDRESS_1207373] Insight and compa red to the true status 
of the study -case.  The frequency of the scores for each method ( Unaided and aided 
with CLEARREAD CT INSIGHT) will be recorded.  This information will be used to 
construct a localized receiver operating characteristic (LROC) curves.  Cut points will be 
used to establish point based estimates, namely; Sensitivity, Specificity, PPV and NPV.  
 
2. Reading times associated with unaided and aided reads will also be assessed.  
 
3. Machine performance will be measured as free response operating curve  (FROC) or 
nodule sensitivity versus patient false positive rate  
 
3.[ADDRESS_1207374] ten (10) participating radiologists will be conducted.  A localized 
receiver operating characteristic curve will be used to evaluate radiologists’ diagnostic 
performance (in terms of the trade -off between the sensitivity and sp ecificity when the 
decision criteria changes) in the detection of lung nodules on lung CTs with and without the 
[ADDRESS_1207375] Insight  system. The time needed for the review and interpretation of 
each case will also be recorded.  
 
An initial (bas eline) interpretation will be made by [CONTACT_865569]. At a minimum of one month later, each radiologists will again interpret the 
same images viewing the pair of CRCTI CT series:  Two sets of CT images (s tandard with CADe 
marks and processed with vessel suppression will be presented on either one large monitor or 
two adjacent monitors.  
 
During the baseline reading the radiologist will mark the location of the actionable nodules and 
assign a score. The rad iologist will also indicate the recommended method of follow -up 
(Contrast CT, PET -CT, CT Follow -up, Biopsy).  
 
During the second reading session (concurrent read), the radiologist will be presented with a 
standard appearing CT with CADe marks placed (left image) and the vessel suppressed same 
slice with the vessel suppressed view (right image). The second image, vessel suppressed, will 
be grayed out until the radiologist move the mouse to the second panel.  The radiologist will 
mark locations.  These may or  may not correspond to the locations of the CAD markers. As 
before, the radiologist will assign a level of suspi[INVESTIGATOR_865565], if any, 
of an additional diagnostic action (Contrast CT, PET -CT, CT Follow -up, or  Biopsy).  
 
Based on the levels of suspi[INVESTIGATOR_865566], LROC 
curves will be constructed for both the baseline and the concurrent reads and the significance 
of any difference will be calculated. The recommendations for further action (Contrast CT, PET -
CT, CT Follow -up, or  Biopsy) will be used to calculate sensitivity and specificity, PPV and NPV.

 Number and types of cases:  
Retrospective lung CT image series from approximately  300 patients will be included in the 
study. Approximately  one hundred (100) of the patients will have pathology confirmed cancers 
and approximately  two hundred (200) of the patients will be CTs associated with normal 
patients.  Also included as nodule images are those where the actionable nodule was not acted 
on at that time, but was detected and acted on based on a subsequent CT.  These are the prior 
images where the nodule can be identified and its location is the same as on the “current” 
image confirmed by [CONTACT_865570] (using a majority of three  as the decision 
criterion).  
The selected sample, randomly selected from a larger pool of CT cases will be enriched in the 
following way:  
 
1. Lung nodules (cancers in this study) will be tumor size T1a (20 mm or less). The 
proportion of nodules [ADDRESS_1207376] of this software to be.  
2. Non -Solid (ground glass) nodules will be added to the sample (based on availability) to 
determine the performance of the system on non -solid nodules. For this group, to  have 
sufficient cases, we may have to include benign (non -malignant) non -solid nodules.  
3. In this project, VIRGINIA TECH  will perform a Machine Test of the ClearRead -CT-Insight  
algorithm  followed by a reader performance evaluation study .  Riverain will provide a 
system configured with the operating point set to be used for the reader studies and a 
configuration for an “open” system to be used for machine testing and FROC generation.  
Figur e 1 shows the reader performance study consists of two arms; Arm 1:  a baseline 
read (no secondary content) and Arm 2:  concurrent, CAD augmented read.

Insight vs. unaided, a mixed effects model (DBM) will be implement ed (similar to the model 
outlined in Dorfman, Berbaum and Metz, 1997), where variance components will be included to 
account for reader, case, reader by [CONTACT_23353], reader by [CONTACT_359742], case by [CONTACT_865571]. However, it is anticipated t hat the three -way interaction will be inestimable 
and will subsequently be dropped from the statistical model. Specifically, the hypothesis to test 
for superiority of ClearRead CT Insight vs. unaided is:  
 
H0: AUC unaided - AUC ClearRead  CT Insight   ≥ 0.0 vs. H A: AUC unaided – AUC ClearRead CT Insight < [ADDRESS_1207378] will 
be a two -sided 95% confidence interval on the effect of modality (i.e. ClearRead CT Insight  
minus unaided ).  Significance will be concluded if the upper bound of the two -sided 95% 
confidence interval does not include zero. If the null hypothesis (H 0) is rejected, the alternative 
hypothesis (H A) is accepted and the superiority of using the ClearR ead CT Insight system will be 
established.  
 
 
 
[ADDRESS_1207379] Insight 
vs. unaid ed is: 
 
H0= T unaided  - TClearRead CT Insight ≤  0 vs. H A= T unaided  - TClearRead CT Insight >  [ADDRESS_1207380] 
Insight  vs. unaided,  a mixed effects model will be implemented (similar to the model outlined in 
Dorfman, Berbaum and Metz, 1992), where variance components will be included to account 
for reader, case, reader by [CONTACT_23353], reader by [CONTACT_359742], case by [CONTACT_865572]. However, it is anticipated that the three -way interaction will be inestimable and will 
subsequently be dropped from the statistica l model.   
The read times will be tested using a two -sided 95% confidence interval on the effect of 
modality (i.e. ClearRead minus unaided ). Significance will be concluded if the upper bound of 
the two -sided 95% confidence interval does not include zero.  
With either analysis, the use of the mixed model could be modified to employ a bootstrap 
sampling approach if the model assumptions of the DBM method have been violated. The 
upper 95 % confidence limit for the difference in the areas under the curves would  be 
calculated using 10,000 bootstraps in the MultiReader MultiCase (MRMC) ROC method.  
 
3.[ADDRESS_1207381] of modality. 
The method of Dorfman, Berbaum and Metz, 1992 (DBM) was implemented utilizing statistical 
mixed model theory with jackknife estimates.  
These simulations required assumptions regardi ng the magnitude of the variance components 
associated with the different random effects. As a pi[INVESTIGATOR_865567], variance component estimates from Riverain study SoftView 
510(k) (Record # BSSI -PR-09-[ZIP_CODE]) that uses a similar technology as the proposed ClearRead 
CT Insight device were used in all power simulations. Please note that the variance components 
listed in Table V were scaled by [CONTACT_865573]. All power estimates are dependent upon the appropriateness of 
the assumed variance components.

The mean difference ∆𝜇= 𝜇1−𝜇2 between modalities corresponding to a specified effect size 
𝛾 was then calculated as  
∆𝜇=𝛾∗𝜎𝑟𝑒𝑠.

respectively, were  evaluated in this simulation study with the following rationale:  
a) An effect size of 0 was chosen to assess type I error in this study.  
b) An effect size of 0.1 was chosen to correspond to a change in AUC of LROC  of 0.084, 
which is 0.10 x √0.8355 .  
c) An effect size of 0.2 was chosen to simulate the expected small improvement in 
accuracy in time.  
d) An effect size of 0.5 was chosen to simulate the expected moderate improvement in 
accuracy or time.  
 
Table VI presents a summary of the power simulations along with add itional scenarios with 
fewer cases with 8 or 10 readers.  Superiority is assessed as the proportion of simulations in 
which the upper bound of the confidence interval on the AUC difference is less than zero. The 
other power assessment is on the statistical  significance of the difference between modality.

[ADDRESS_1207383] 10% of the standard deviation is  over 80% given the assumed 
magnitude of the variance components, even with only [ADDRESS_1207384] size of 0.0914/0.1234, 
or 0.741, the superiority of ClearRead CT Insight would be detected with adequate power.  
 
There are several scenari os including reduced number of cases and a reduced number of 
readers.   Even with [ADDRESS_1207385] size of 0.1.

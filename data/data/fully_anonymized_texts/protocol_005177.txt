4.1 BACKGROUND  
Chronic wounds, including leg ulcers (LU), diabetic foot ulcers (DFU), a nd pressure ulcers (PU), 
significantly impact patients’ quali ty of life. These chronic wounds fail to heal and remain stuck 
in an inflammatory phase. In developed countries , the incidence of chronic wounds has increased 
in recent years1, possibly due to an aging population with  an abundance of concurrent illnesses 
such as diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and peripheral vascular disease. 
In the [LOCATION_008], it is estimated that 15 to 18 out of 1000 people suffer from VLU; the 
cost to treat these and other chronic wounds was between £2-[ADDRESS_621610]  of treating chronic wounds in the US at $6-[ADDRESS_621611] of treating DFU alone at $[ADDRESS_621612] provi de the following at a 
minimum: 
• a barrier to exogenous cont amination and infection  
• adequate management of wound exudate 
• maintenance of a moist wound healing environment 
Failure of a dressing to deliver th ese fundamental features will nega tively impact the ability of a 
complex wound to heal and may allow the w ound to deteriorate. Failure to prevent 
contamination may allow a wound to become inf ected. Inability to manage moderate to high 
exudate volume may lead to maceration of the peri-wound skin, which can lead to further wound 
breakdown if untreated. At the same time, a dr essing should not allow a wound to dry out; the 
dressing should maintain a moist wound heali ng environment. The consequences of wound

preventable hospi[INVESTIGATOR_483689].  
This study will focus on the use of ALLEVYN LI FE™ Non-Bordered (ALNB) in the treatment 
of chronic wounds. ALNB is a new multilayer foam  dressing that is intended to provide an 
optimal moist wound healing environment to pr omote the healing of moderate and highly 
exuding wounds.  
ALNB is the latest addition to the ALLEVYN LIFE range of dressings, which were first 
launched in 2012. The introduction of ALNB recognizes the fact that clinicians sometimes prefer 
using a non-bordered absorbent pr oduct with wounds that requi re a secondary dressing, e.g. 
compression bandaging for leg ulcers.  
While the present study will be the first clinical trial to evalua te the actual use of ALNB in 
clinical practice, the or iginal ALLEVYN LIFE dressing has been used in several clinical studies. 
The results of these suggest that ALLEV YN LIFE supports good wound progression, wound 
granulation, healthy condition of the su rrounding skin, and patient satisfaction5. 
Because medical devices are designed to  improve the patient’s quality of life6, the primary 
outcome in the study will be the differences in Health-Related Quality of  Life (HRQoL) between 
subjects treated with ALNB and Standard Care (SC) for subjects with moderate to highly 
exuding chronic wounds. The subjects will be surveyed using the Cardiff Wound Impact 
Schedule (CWIS)[ADDRESS_621613] article can be found 
in the Package Insert (A LLEVYN LIFE Non-Bordered).   
4.2 SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS  
Precautions for the use of ALNB, as specified in  the current Instructions for Use (IFU), are: 
 Do not use with oxidizing agents such as hypochlorite solutions (e.g. EUSOL) or 
hydrogen peroxide, as thes e can reduce the absorben cy of the dressing.

 Single-use only; if used on more than one s ubject, cross contamination or infection may 
occur. 
 Once the pouch is opened, do not retain unused dressings for application at a later date. 
Risks associated with the use of ALNB within the present st udy will be mitigated as follows: 
 Study personnel will be trained in the correct use of ALNB prior to applying the dressing 
to the wounds of study subjects. 
 Study personnel will be tr ained on the study protocol. 
 Study personnel will be directed  to carefully follow the incl usion and exclusion criteria 
for participation in the study when  assessing the subj ect eligibility. 
 Study personnel will be directed to read and follow the IFU.

material. The silicone adhesive layer is gentle, even to fragil e skin, and makes it easy to apply, 
reposition, and remove. A breathable opaque outer film helps mask exuda te, prevent bacterial 
contamination, and is showerproof when used  with appropriate secondary retention. 
4.2.2 Hazards/Harms 
This will be the first study to evaluate the use of  ALNB in clinical practic e; there is currently no 
direct clinical evidence concerning the safety of ALNB.  
ALLEVYN LIFE has been used widely over the la st four years and has been shown to be 
equivalent to ALNB with regard to material s and fluid handling properties (see Section 6).

This document contains confidential information, which is the property of  Smith & Nephew, Inc.  Do not copy, disclose, or 
circulate without written authorization from the a ppropriate Smith & Ne phew personnel surveillance (PMS) data consistently indicate that  the risk of adverse events is low and that 
reactions which do occur are genera lly local to the application s ite and are mild in severity. 
Adverse events are well characte rized and are manageable in the majority of cases. As such, 
ALLEVYN LIFE demonstrates an ac ceptable benefit-risk profile.  
Because of the similarities  between ALLEVYN LIFE and ALNB, the anticipated medical 
benefits of ALNB are also expected to outweig h risks. There are some differences between the 
two products, including:  
 ALNB can be cut to size without comp romising its performance characteristics 
 ALNB does not incorporate a change indicator, as this  would be obscured by [CONTACT_483715] 
 ALNB includes a lower tack adhesive, to serv e as a ‘third hand’, and enable the dressing 
to be removed and repositioned more easily 
 ALNB requires the use of a sec ondary dressing to  aid retention 
The use of a lower tack adhesive with ALNB  may positively impact safety by [CONTACT_483716][INVESTIGATOR_483690]. Unlike ALLEVYN LIFE, ALNB 
requires a secondary dressing to  aid retention. Choice of anc illary dressing, together with 
associated risks relating to this secondary devi ce, will be carefully monitored during this study.  
There are no anticipated Serious  Adverse Device Effects (SADE) associated with the use of 
ALNB.  
5. OBJECTIVES 
The aim of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_2269] (RCT) is to gather preliminary clinical, health 
economic and safety data on the use of ALNB in the treatment of chronic wounds, for post-
market surveillance and to assist with planning future research concerned with the efficacy and 
cost-effectiveness of ALNB.

The present study aims to evaluate  the use of ALNB for adult ( ≥ 18 years of age) subjects with 
moderate to highly exuding chroni c ulcers that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], would benefit 
from a protective dressing but do not require a topi[INVESTIGATOR_483688], limited to: 
 Pressure ulcers, excluding Stage 1. Inclusi on of other stages, in cluding “unstageable”, 
depends on the level of exuda te and lack of infection. 
 Non-ischemic diabetic foot ul cers (Wagner Grade 1 or 2) 
 Leg ulcers  
Dressing description 
ALNB is a quadrilobed or rectangular shaped exudate management wound  dressing which is a 
new variant of ALLEVYN LIFE. ALNB is a non-bordered dressing, allowing it to be cut to the 
shape of the wound before use. ALNB uses a low- tack silicone adhesive. ALNB incorporates an 
opaque, moisture-vapor permeable (MVP) top film that allows for some masking of the exudate 
penetration.  
Construction of ALNB 
ALNB is a composite dressing; it is made up of  4 layers (see Figure 6.1.1-1), including the MVP 
top film, a superabsorbent layer, a foam laye r, and a wound contact [CONTACT_483719] (see Figure 6.1.1-2). 
The wound contact [CONTACT_483720].

Subjects allocated to the comparator arm of the study shall receive SC, defined as any protective 
wound dressing(s) which, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_2511] I nvestigator, would be bene ficial in treating the 
wound, other than: 
 variants of ALLEVYN 
 topi[INVESTIGATOR_166464], such as Acti coat™, Iododsorb™, silver products, etc. 
 negative pressure wound therapy 
Standard care should correspond as closely as possible to normal c linical practice, and dressings 
used routinely within each  individual research site. 
6.1.[ADDRESS_621619] 
At Smith & Nephew’s discretion, the following anci llary products may be made available to 
research sites for use on study subjects during this study – OPSITE™, PROFORE™, 
DURAFIBER™, and INTRASITE™. However, this  study does not requ ire any particular 
ancillary dressing to be used to secure ALNB. Ra ther, selection of ancillary dressings should be 
determined based on clinical requirements.  
Per the IFU, physicians may use INTRASITE under ALNB, as clin ically warranted.  
6.[ADDRESS_621620] USE 
6.2.1 HCP Training 
Study center personnel with responsibilities for the me dical care of subjects and/or application of 
the investigational product (ALNB) will be traine d on the use and application of ALNB prior to 
enrolling subjects into the study. HCP training will only occur following completion of the 
clinical trial agreement. HCP training will invo lve a presentation on the correct application and 
use of ALNB, including frequency of dressing ch ange. ALNB is a moderate to highly absorbent 
dressing which can be worn for up to seven days  and should be changed as directed in the 
product IFU (see Sections 6.2.3 and 21.1), rather than due to routine schedule or convenience.

9.5 STUDY METHODS AND MEASUREMENTS  
9.5.1 Ulcer Assessments 
Modified Bates-Jensen Wound Assessment Tool 
1. Undermining : Assess by [CONTACT_4859] a cotton-ti pped applicator under the wound edge; advance it as far as it will 
go without using undue force; raise the tip of the applicator so it may be s een or felt on the surface of the skin; 
mark the surface with a pen; measure the distance from the mark on the skin to the edge of the wound. 
Continue process around the wound. Then use a transp arent metric measuring guide with concentric circles 
divided into 4 (25%) pie-shaped quadrants to help determine the percent of wound involved.

White/gray non-viable tissue = May appear prior to wound opening; skin  surface is white or 
gray. 
Non-adherent, yellow slough = Thin, mucinous substance; scattered throughout wound bed; 
easily separated from wound tissue. 
Loosely adherent, yellow 
slough = Thick, stringy, clumps of debris; attached to wound tissue. 
Adherent, soft, black eschar = Soggy tissue; strongly attached to tissue in center or base of 
wound. 
Firmly adherent, hard/black

This study does not require the coll ection of any biological samples.  
9.5.5 Ulcer Classification 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Pressure Ulcers8 
Stage 1 Pressure Injury: Non-blanchable erythema of intact skin 
Intact skin with a localized area of non-blanchable erythema, which may appear different in darkly pi[INVESTIGATOR_437637]. Presence of blanchable erythema or changes in sensation, temperature, or firmness may precede visual 
changes. Color changes do not include purple or maroon discoloration; these may i ndicate deep tissue pressure 
injury.  
Stage 2 Pressure Injury: Partial-thickn ess skin loss with exposed dermis 
Partial-thickness loss of skin with exposed dermis. The ulcer bed is viable, pi[INVESTIGATOR_483703], moist, and may also 
present as an intact or ruptured serum-filled blister. Adipose (fat) is not visible and deeper tissues are not 
visible. Granulation tissue, slough, and eschar are no t present. These injuries commonly result from adverse 
microclimate and shear in the skin over the pelvis and shear in the heel. This stage should not be used to 
describe moisture associated skin damage (MASD)  including incontinence associated dermatitis (IAD), 
intertriginous dermatitis (ITD), medical adhesive-related skin injury (MARSI), or traumatic wounds (skin 
tears, burns, abrasions).  
Stage 3 Pressure Injury: Full-thickness skin loss 
Full-thickness loss of skin, in which adipose (fat) is visible in the ulcer and granulation tissue and epi[INVESTIGATOR_483704] 
(rolled wound edges) are often present. Slough and/or eschar may be visible. The depth of tissue damage 
varies by [CONTACT_483736]; ar eas of significant adiposity can develop deep wounds. Undermining and

10. STATISTICAL DESIGN 
There will be a formal Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP); the following is a brief description of the 
summaries and analyses to be  described in this plan.  
Unless otherwise stated, all si gnificance tests and hypothesis testing will be two-sided, 
performed at the 5% significance level. Resul ting p-values will be quoted and 95% two-sided 
confidence intervals will be generated where appr opriate. All analyses wi ll be performed in SAS 
v9.4, or later. 
Where data summaries are specified, categorical and ordinal variables wi ll be summarized using 
frequency distributions, which will detail the numb er and percentage of subjects that fall into 
each category. Continuous variables will be summa rized using the following summary statistics: 
mean, median, standard deviation, minimum and maximum values, and number of observations. 
10.1 EVALUABILITY  
All subjects who provide informed consent ar e considered study participants. Study populations 
are defined as follows: 
 Safety population (SAF) : all subjects who receive study treatment. This population will 
be used for summaries of dis position of the subjects, protoc ol deviations/violations, and 
safety.

who receive study treatment and attend at l east one post-baseline assessment will be 
included. This population will be used for the pr imary analysis of baseline characteristics, 
primary variables, secondary variab les and explorator y variables.  
 Per protocol (PP) population:  includes all subjects in the FAS population who have no 
significant protocol deviati ons, meet the inclusion/excl usion criteria, and did not 
withdraw early (except for closure at a ny time). This population will be used for 
supportive evidence of the primary variable.

Subject responses to individual items at each asse ssment will be summarized as ordinal variables 
by [CONTACT_3148], wound type (and overall) a nd level of exudate at baseline.  
The CWIS-PSDL score at Baseline and 6 weeks will be summarized as a continuous variable by 
[CONTACT_3148], wound type (and overall) a nd level of exudate  at baseline. 
The increase in CWIS-PSDL score between the Baseline and 6 weeks will be summarized as a 
continuous variable by [CONTACT_3148] , wound type (and overall), base line mobility, and level of 
exudate at baseline. 
For the primary analysis, an ANC OVA model will be fit to the FA S population with the increase 
in CWIS-PSDL score between the Baseline and 6 weeks as the dependent variable, treatment 
(ALNB or SC) and center will be included in the model as fixed effects and subject will be 
included as a random effect. The covariates for th e model to be considered will be wound type, 
baseline CWIS-PSDL score, base line exudate level, baseline mobility, and baseline wound area.  
The null hypothesis will be that there is no diffe rence between the treatments in the increase 
from baseline to 6 weeks in the CWIS-PSDL score. An estimate of the LS mean difference between the treatments (ALNB – SC) for the CWIS -PSDL score will be reported, along with the 
corresponding 95% confidence interval and p-value.  
If the assumptions of ANCOVA are not met then a non-parametric analysis will be considered 
the primary analysis for this variable. A Wilcoxon Rank-Sum test will be used to test for a 
difference in the increase from baseline scor e between the two treatments and the Hodges-
Lehmann estimate of the median difference will be reported with  the corresponding 95% 
confidence interval. 
This analysis will be repeated using the per-pro tocol population and used as supportive evidence 
to the primary analysis. Any further sensitivity analyses and discussion of methods of handling 
missing data will be defined in the SAP.

12.1.1  Adverse Event 
An Adverse Event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence temporally associated with the use 
of an investigational medicinal product or device , whether or not considered causally related to 
that product/device. An AE can be any unfavor able and unintended sign (for example, an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease. 
AE is used both to refer to AE which are not seri ous or device related and as an umbrella term 
referring to adverse events  of all classifications.  
12.1.[ADDRESS_621649] (ADE) 
An Adverse Device Effect (ADE) is an adverse ev ent that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], is 
related to the investigationa l or comparator device:  
• Not Related  – An AE is considered to be not rela ted to the use of the test article when 
the effect is DEFINITELY UN RELATED or UNLIKELY to have any relationship to 
the use of the test article; 
• Related  – An AE is considered to be related to the use of the test ar ticle when there is a 
POSSIBLE, PROBABLE, or DEFI NITE relationship between the AE and the use of the 
test article.

An ADE is further categorized depending on wh ether the criteria in  section 12.1.3 and 12.1.4 are 
met.  
12.1.3  Seriousness  
An AE and an ADE are considered “serious” if, in  the view of either th e Investigator or the 
sponsor, it: 
• Results in death 
• Is life-threatening ( NOTE : The term “life-threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers 
to an event/reaction in which the subject wa s at risk of death at the time of the 
event/reaction; it does not re fer to an event/reaction whic h hypothetically might have 
caused death if it were more severe) 
• Requires in subject hospi[INVESTIGATOR_483707] 
• Results in persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disrupti on of the ability to

A [LOCATION_003]DE is a serious ADE that meets any of the above definitions but is also considered, by [CONTACT_3786], to be caused by [CONTACT_483747], not previously identified in 
nature, severity or degree in the ALLEVYN LI FE Non-Bordered Instructions for use. An 
ASADE is a serious ADE that does not  meet the criteria for a [LOCATION_003]DE.  
12.1.5  Severity   
The severity of every AE will be assessed by [CONTACT_3433] e Principal Investigator (PI). AE should be 
classified as mild, moderate, or severe, regardless of whether or not  the AE are considered to be 
serious or non-serious. The classification should be based on the following definitions: 
• Mild  – An event is mild if the subject is aw are of, but can easily tolerate the sign or 
symptom; 
• Moderate  – An event is moderate if the si gn or symptom results in discomfort 
significant enough to cause interference w ith the subject’s usual activities; 
• Severe  – An event is severe if the sign or symptom is incapacitating and results in the 
subject’s inability to work or e ngage in their usual activities. 
12.1.6  Device Deficiency (DevD) 
A DevD is an inadequacy of a medical device wi th respect to its iden tity, quality, durability, 
reliability, safety or performance. DevD in clude malfunctions, use errors and inadequate 
labeling.  
12.2 REPORTING PROCEDURES  
AE of any kind and DevD will be recorded in th e applicable forms, eCRF, and source notes. The 
Investigator will evaluate all AE for relationshi p to the device, seriousness, and severity. ADE, 
SAE, and DevD will be entered into the eCRF a nd reported to the Sponsor within 24 hours of the

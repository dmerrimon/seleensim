6 1. OBJECTIVES 
 
This study involves a prospective, 2-arm randomi zed, double blinded Phase 2 investigation of the 
effectiveness of an amino acid mixture, Enterade® versus placebo in redu cing diarrhea associated 
with melphalan conditioning in  patients undergoing autologous st em-cell transplantation for 
Multiple Myeloma or Non-Hodgkin Lympho ma. The hypothesis is that Enterade® when combined 
with standard supportive care will help maintain the small bowel’s ability to absorb fluids and lead 
to a reduction in diarrhea volume,  as well as patient reported gastrointestinal symptoms and 
improved quality of life followi ng autologous hematopoietic stem  cell transplantation (HSCT) 
with Melphalan conditioning as compared to standard supportive care alone.  
 
1.1 Study Design 
 
This study will be a single-center, double blinde d, 2-arm randomized Phase 2 trial, designed to 
compare the efficacy of Enterade® versus placebo in decreasing gastro intestinal toxicity in patients 
undergoing autologous HSCT with high-dose Mel phalan conditioning. This study will enroll [ADDRESS_55641]. The 
trial will randomize patients over an appr oximately 12 month period. Randomization will be 
stratified by [CONTACT_637] (Multiple Myeloma vs. Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma).  Arm A will receive 
Enterade® (one 8-oz bottle) twice daily from admissi on and/or the day of conditioning to day +14 
(or discharge if occurs prior to day +14) following  transplantation in conjunction with institutional 
standard of supportive care. Arm B will receive a place bo twice daily from admission  and/or the 
day of conditioning to day +14 (or discharge if occurs prior to day +14) in addition standard of care per institutional guidelines.

on admission, and day +7 and day +[ADDRESS_55646] 
- To assess plasma endotoxin and cytokine levels of IL-1 β, TNF-, in all patients receiving 
Melphalan with serum samples collected  at day +7 after transplantation.  
 
2. BACKGROUND 
 
2.1 Study Disease(s) 
 
The alkylating agent, Melphalan, remains the main stay of conditioning for autologous HSCT in 
multiple myeloma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma patients.1,[ADDRESS_55647] significant non-hematologic  toxicity following high-dose Melphalan conditioning. 2,3 
These symptoms include mucositis, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting and decreased appetite. High dose chemotherapy also induces protein catabolism, disruption of the gastroin testinal mucosa, and 
oxidative stress.
4-7 Increased intestinal permeability facilit ates translocation of microorganisms 
and endotoxins into the bloodstream ; which can lead to neutropenic fevers and even sepsis. 8-[ADDRESS_55648]. The mucosal sequelae of Me lphalan and the subsequent  enteritis are similar 
to those induced by [CONTACT_52477], with approximately 40% of patients experiencing 
CTCAE grade 2 or higher diarrhea following conditioning regimens containing Melphalan.
11  
 
For the purposes of this study, participants could ha ve received the original formulation of 
Melphalan or the newer formula called Evomela depending on the availability in the pharmacy.   
 2.2 IND Agent(s) 
 
2.2.1 IND Agent #1: N/A 
 
2.3 Other Agent(s) 
 
Enterade® is a proprietary blend of el ectrolytes and amino acids in concentrations within the daily 
dose range recommended by [CONTACT_52478] (WHO). All components are GRAS 
(Generally Recognized as Safe), ap proved and without toxicity. Enterade® is a bottled drink that 
is administered orally in 8 oz. commercially availa ble bottles. Patients will be instructed to drink 
two bottles of Enterade® or placebo each day, at l east thirty minutes before meals or one hour after 
DF/HCC Protocol #: 16-329  
Protocol Version Date:   3 January 2017 
 
8 meals but do not need to finish an entire bottle dur ing a single ingestion. No  other restrictions on 
diet or dose time will be required. 
 Please see Section 8.1 for a deta iled description of Enterade
® and its ingredients.  
 
The placebo will consist of water with natural fla voring agents and stevia, in the same composition 
as used in Enterade®.  
 
2.[ADDRESS_55649] is glutamine. 
Glutamine is a classic nonessential amino acid used as a major fuel by [CONTACT_52479]. In prospec tive, randomized, double b lind trials, intake of 
oral glutamine was not associated  with significant di fferences between study groups in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7491], days on parenteral nutrition, neutrophil recovery, inci dence of positive blood 
cultures and sepsis, diarrhea severity or incidence, or severity of mucositis.14,15 
 
Enterade® is a medical food composed of an amino acid mixture delivered as a beverage. Enterade® 
contains only nutrients, flavoring and sweeteners, list ed as GRAS (generally reco gnized as safe). It is 
created by [CONTACT_2329] 7 of  the 20 amino acids that ma ke up the body . All other ingredient s are natural. It 
consists of a combination of water, amino acids (Valine, Aspartic  Acid, Serine, Isol eucine, Threonine, 
Lysine, Glycine, Tyrosine), sodium chloride, natural flavor, sodium citrate,  potassium chloride, gum 
acacia, calcium chloride, magnes ium chloride, and stevia.  
 
These specific nutrients can facilitate retention of the absorbing capacity of the small intestine. It does not contain nutrients that ar e poorly absorbed, thus elimina ting the presence of unabsorbed 
nutrients and electrolytes in the gut lumen, which reduces the risk of osmotic diarrh ea. In a study 
of irradiated mice, Enterade
® improved survival and improved body weight following irradiation. 
On electron microscopy of the ileum, there was loss of cell-to-cell contact [CONTACT_52480], which 
was restored after the introduction of Enterade®. This study also suggested that the irradiated mice 
who received Enterade® had lower levels of plasma endotoxin and IL-1 β suggesting less bacterial 
translocation and inflammation as compared to the c ontrol population.

9 following irradiation. 
	
 
(A) Residual weight of irradiated mice that received saline (control), Enterade®, or a mixture of amino acids that had 
reduced absorption and no beneficial effect on the mucosal barrier following irradiation (other AA).  Mice treated with 
other aa showed > 20% weight loss in less than 10 days, whereas control animals reached > 20% weight loss by [CONTACT_941] 15th 
day.  Mice treated with the correct amino acid mixture showed  steady weight gain beyond 18 days. (B) Mice treated with 
the correct amino acid mixture showed >6 6% survival beyond 25 days. Mice receiving the poorly absorbed AA died earlier 
than the saline controls. N=25 animals/group. Error bar represents SEM. 	
 
This prospective, double-blinded, phase 2 random ized study is to assess the effectiveness of 
Enterade® in reducing diarrhea associated with high dose Melphalan chemotherapy. The 
hypothesis is that Enterade® when combined with standard suppor tive care will he lp maintain the 
small bowel’s ability to retain fluids leading to  a reduction in diarrhea volume, patient reported 
gastrointestinal symptoms and improved quality of life after autologous HSCT with Melphalan 
conditioning when compared to st andard supportive care alone.  
 
2.5 Correlative Studies Background 
 
One of the secondary endpoints in this study w ill involve evaluation of plasma endotoxin and 
circulating cytokine levels in peripheral blood samples. Radiation and chemotherapy associated 
enteritis results in loss of mucosal integrity and increased paracellular permeability across the 
intestinal mucosa. This leads to increased bacter ial translocation as well as increased systemic 
inflammation.   To assess systemic inflammation, blood samples for cytokine analysis will be collected at day +7 

DF/HCC Protocol #: 16-329  
Protocol Version Date:   [ADDRESS_55650] in a 5 mL EDTA tube and stored in the clinical facility until they are 
ready to be tested. Commercially available ELISA assays will be used to assess pro-inflammatory 
cytokines such as IL-1 , and TNF α. Gut inflammation will be assessed 
 through the analysis of fecal la ctoferrin, with stool specimens collected on admission, and day +7 
following autologous transplantation.  
 Additionally, stool samples will al so be collected from participan ts on or before admission, and on 
a weekly basis for gut microbiome analysis until day +14 or discharge if it occurs prior to day +14. 
Chemotherapy and radiation result in a decrease  in the number and diversity of intestinal 
microbiota and result in enteritis from disruption of the mucosal epi[INVESTIGATOR_2130]. However, it is unclear 
what role commensal flora may play in minimizing gut inflammation, and maintaining gut barrier function.

Patients found to be eligible for the study will be enrolled and ra ndomized into either the Enterade
® 
treatment arm (Arm A) or place bo (Arm B). During the course of  their admission, those patients 
randomized to Arm A will be given two 8 oz. bottles daily of Enterade® from admission and/or 
the day of conditioning until day +14 or until discha rge if discharged prior to day +[ADDRESS_55656], to augment their daily diet. Those randomized to Arm B will be given two 8 
oz. bottles of placebo from admi ssion and/or the day of conditi oning until day +14 or until 
discharge if discharged prior to  day +[ADDRESS_55657] the 81 patients 
undergoing transplantation for NHL, the average le ngth of stay in 2014 was 22 days with a range 
of 17 to 58 days.   Enterade
® and placebo administration w ill begin on the day prior  or  the day of initiation of 
conditioning. Enterade® or placebo will be administered on an inpatient basis only. Their daily 
consumption of Enterade® or placebo will be recorded as a fraction of each bottle consumed. 
Timing of Enterade® or placebo administration will  be at least thirty minutes prior to meals or at 
least one hour after meals but patients need not consume each bottle in one sitting and can continue to consume the drink in sips throughout the day.

13. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 
This is a randomized, double-blinded  phase 2 trial of comparing the efficacy of the investigational drug, Enterade
® versus placebo in conjunction with standard-of-care (SOC) in decreasing diarrhea-
related gastrointestinal (GI) t oxicity in patients undergoing auto logous hematopoietic stem cell 
transplantation (HSCT) with melphalan c onditioning for Multiple Myeloma or non-Hodgkin 
Lymphoma.  
13.1 Study Design/Endpoints 
 
The study is a one stage phase II trial with two arms. The primary endpoint is the incidence of 
NCI-CTCAE 4.[ADDRESS_55685]. A total of 114 patients 
DF/HCC Protocol #: 16-329  
Protocol Version Date:   3 January 2017 
 
24 (57 patients per arm) will be randomly  assigned in 1:1 ratio to eith er the investigational drug (Arm 
A) or  placebo  (Arm B) prior to autologous HSCT.  
 
Based on the preliminary data with  SOC alone, we hypothesize that th e grade 3 or higher diarrhea 
GI toxicity will be 30%  in the placebo arm.  With the investigational drug, we project that the 
grade 3 or diarrhea higher GI toxicity will be 10% . With the sample size 57 per arm, there will be 
80% power to detect a 20% differe nce in grade 3 or higher diarrhea GI toxicity between two arms. 
This power calculation is based on Fisher’s exact test at one-sided  type I error rate of 0.05.   
 
13.[ADDRESS_55686] for Multiple Myeloma or Non-Hodgkin Ly mphoma between 2013 and 2014. In the year 
2013, 274 patients underwent autologous transplantation for Multiple Myeloma (182 patients) or Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma (92 patients). The fo llowing year, 159 patients underwent autologous 
transplantation for Multiple Myeloma and 81 for Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma, accounting for a 
total of 240 patients. We anticipate recruitment of approximately sixty percent of eligible patients.

13.3 Randomization/Stratification Factors 
 
After enrollment, patients will be randomized in 1:1 ratio between two arms using 
DF/HCC Protocol #: 16-329  
Protocol Version Date:   3 January 2017 
 
25 permuted block algorithm within strata. Randomization will be stratified based on diagnosis of 
Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma or Multiple Myeloma prio r to transplantation. No additional interim 
monitoring will be performed that is unique to each stratum. Efficacy determination will be the 
same for each stratum as noted in the primary and secondary e ndpoints outlined in section 1.2 and 
1.3.   
13.4 Interim Monitoring Plan 
 
All adverse events will be monitored closely. Monitoring of key safety endpoints (GI toxicity, 
fever, neutropenia) will be conducted in accordan ce with the DF/HCC DSMB meeting (see Section 
12.2). The investigational drug is a medical food co mposed of an amino acid mixture and generally 
recognized as safe constituents. We thus do not antic ipate any toxicity or pot ential risks. However, 
taking the advantage of a randomized trial with a standard treatment ar m, we will compare all 
grade 2 or higher treatment re lated toxicity in accordan ce with the DSMB meeting.  
If, at any of these looks, this difference is sign ificant at the two-sided level of 0.05, this would 
trigger a consultation with the DF/HCC DSMB for additional review. However, this will not be 
formal stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_52465]. In addition, we 
will assess the feasibility of the tr ial at the first look. With the an ticipated accrual ra te, we project 
2-3 looks before the completion of the accrual.  
 13.5 Analysis of Primary and Secondary Endpoints 
 
The primary analysis will be the modified intentio n-to-treat (ITT) analysis  for the primary endpoint 
of grade [ADDRESS_55687] will be 
compared using Fisher’s exact test.   Secondary endpoints as listed in  Section 1.3 include frequenc y and duration of fever and

medications, tolerability, patient reported quality  of life (QOL), and the length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]. 
Correlative studies include assess ment of cytokine levels, fecal  lactoferrin, and markers of 
nutrition and inflammation. For group comparison, Fish er’s exact test or a Chi-square test, as 
appropriate, will be used for categorical va riables and Wilcoxon-Rank-Sum or t-test, as 
appropriate, will be used for continuous variable s. In addition, correlation analysis between the 
primary and secondary endpoints will be perf ormed and multivariable linear regression and 
logistic regression analysis will be explored to id entify factors that are asso ciated with the primary 
outcome and to identify a subset patients who deve lop grade [ADDRESS_55688] treatment change, gra phical assessments, McNamer’s test or Wilcoxon-
Signed rank test as approp riate, and regression analysis will be utilized.  
 
As to the assessment of patient reported QOL, we	project	that	70%	of	all	randomized	patients	
will	agree	to	participate	in	the	QOL	assessment.	This	projection	is	based	previous	QOL	
assessment	in	the	HSCT	setting.	In	particular,	we	are	intereste d	in	the	overall	Epic	bowl

(i.e.,	mean	difference	between	two	groups	divided	by	[CONTACT_52489])	is	0.7,	there	will

 Special Studies   Stool Samples: Section 9.1   
 Admission, Day 0, Day +7, Day +14 (or day of discharge if prior to Day +14 ) 
  
 Biomarkers: The time points are in Section 9.1  
 Cytokines   Day +7 ( Blood tubes provided and after drawn  place in dedicated bin on unit for CRC to collect)  
 Charting  Tips   
Intake: All study  agents  require documentati on of  administration time as well as the amount tolerated  
 Amount drank should be documented in the Intake- > Other section of the Intake/Output Flowsheet.  
 At time of discarding the bottle, document how much was drank in mL in the flow sheet.  
 Flow sheet documentation can occur at any po int after supplement given but before or at the time of next supplement.  
Output: 
 Strict I/Os should be kept daily.  
 Stool output needs to be documented daily in the Output  - > Stool assessment section of the Intake/Output Flowsheet.  
 Incontinence, Stool Appearance and Stool amount should be documented. If the stool is formed then a x1 as currently documente d is fine. If 
there is mixed urine/stool – this should be documented in a separate row with the volume of the output.  
Weights:  
o Weights should be documented in EPIC on Admission, Day +7 and Day +14 (or day of discharge if prior to Day +14).

Protocol Number:  H1337 -CS202 
Study Title:  A Phase 2b Randomized, Double -masked , Active -controlled, 
Dose -response Study of the Safety and Efficacy of H -1337 in 
Subjects with Primary Open Angle Glaucoma (POAG) or 
Ocular Hypertension  
Study Objectives:  Primary Objective:  
Evaluate the ocular hypotensive efficacy of 3 dose regimens of 
H-1337 compared to timolol maleate 0.5% in subjects with 
POAG or OHT treated for up to 28 days.  
 
Secondary Objectives:  
Evaluate the local ocular and systemic safety of 3 dose 
regimens of H -1337.  
 
Exploratory Objectives:  
• Evaluate the efficacy of diurnal IOP measurements of 3 
dose regimens  of H -1337 compared to timolol 0.5%  
Study Population:  Subjects with bilateral POAG or OHT  
Number of Subjects:  Approximately 200 
Investigational Products:  
 H-1337 0.6% Ophthalmic Solution b.i.d.  
H-1337 1.0% Ophthalmic Solution b.i.d.  
H-1337 1.0% Ophthalmic Solution q.a.m.  
H-1337 placebo q.p.m.  
Timolol 0.5% Ophthalmic Solution b.i.d.  
Route and Duration of 
Administration:  Topi[INVESTIGATOR_358463]; 28 days treatment  
Study Design:  The trial will evaluate the safety and efficacy of 3 dose 
regimens of H -1337 (0.6% b.i.d., 1.0% b.i.d. and 1.0% q.a.m., 
and timolol maleate (0.5%, b.i.d.) OU for 28 days.  
Efficacy assessments will be made based upon the study eye.  
The study eye is the eye that meets all entry criteria including 
the intraocular pressure (IOP) inclusion criteria.  If both eyes 
qualify the study eye is the eye with the higher 8 am IOP on 
Baseline ( Day 1 ).  If both eyes have the same 8 am IOP on 
Baseline ( Day 1 ), the study eye is the right eye.  
Primary Efficacy 
Measure:  
 Change from baseline in IOP in 3 dose regimens of H -1337 
compared to timolol 0.5%., b.i.d. at 28 days in subjects with 
POAG or ocular hypertension.

D. Western Therapeutics, Inc.  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 18 of 46 1. Background  
Glaucoma is a slowly progressive optic neuropathy characterized by a loss of retinal ganglion 
cells (RGC) and optic nerve axons resulting in vision loss.  Glaucoma is generally asymptomatic 
until advanced irreversible disease has occurred.  Data from population -based surveys indicate 
that one in 40 adults older than 40 years has glaucoma with loss of visual function, which 
equates to 60 million people worldwide being affected and 8·4 million being bilaterally legally 
blind. Even in developed countries, half  of glaucoma cases are undiagnosed ( Quigley 2011 , 
Glaucoma  Research Foundation . https://glaucoma.org/glaucoma -facts -and-stats/ ).  
 
As elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) is a major risk for loss of visual field and optic nerve, 
reduction of IOP by [CONTACT_115645], laser and/or surgical means  is the current standard of care for 
patients with glaucoma.   While there are many therapi[INVESTIGATOR_55328], each has its own benefits and 
risks.  Some patients, even with proper diagnosis and treatment, still continue to have 
progressive glaucomatous loss of visual function and/or optic nerve.   
 
H-1337 is a selective multi -kinase inhibitor, and the proposed mechanism of action of the 
compound is hypothesized to involve inhibition of kinases that play a role in controlling 
intracellular cytoskeletal dynamics and contractility.  While the regulation of intraocular pressure 
by [CONTACT_358490] (trabecular) outflow pathway is complicated , extracellular matrix expression 
and trabecular meshwork cytoskeletal shape and contractility appear  to be important  to control 
outflow resistance.  
 
In a previous controlled study, H -[ADDRESS_447178] of H -1337 on aqueous humor dynamics 
(Hartman et al, 2022 ). 
 
The present study aims to extend the previous findings with additional concentrations and doses , 
as well as including a positive control (timolol ophthalmic solution).  
1.1 Investigational Agent  
H-1337 is a selective multi -kinase inhibitor.  The Sponsor hypothesizes  that inhibition of kinases 
that control  intracellular cytoskeletal dynamics  at the level of the trabecular meshwork  and other 
cells that regulate flow is a mechanism that will improve outflow.   As open -angle glaucoma is a 
disease of decreased trabecular outflow, the Sponsor believes that H -1337 beneficially enhance s 
aqueous outflow by [CONTACT_358491] ™ cells to decrease 
resistance to  fluid transport .  
 
The H -[ADDRESS_447179] is a preserved, isotonic, sterile ophthalmic solution at 
two concentrations (w/v) (0.6% and 1.0%), buffered at pH 6.5 (range 6.3 – 6.7), as is the 
placebo. Sodium chloride is used to adjust the osmolarity to 280 - 320 mOsm/kg.  The primary 
drug product packaging is a white, sterile low -density polyethylene (LDPE) multi -dose 5 mL 
bottle with LDPE nozzle/dropper insert and high -density polyethylene (HDPE) ophthalmic cap.  
H1337 -CS202 Version 3.0                                                                                                     Version Date: [ADDRESS_447180] from water vapor transmission.  
The placebo control  (vehicle)  will consist of the components of the ophthalmic formulation 
without H-1337 .  
 
Timolol ophthalmic solution is supplied as a sterile, isotonic, buffered, aqueous solution of 
timolol maleate .  The pH of the solution is approximately 7.0, and the osmolarity is 274 -328 
mOsm /kg.  Each mL of timolol ophthalmic solution 0.5% contains 5 mg of timolol (6.8 mg of 
timolol maleate). Inactive  ingredients: monobasic and dibasic sodium phosphate, sodium 
hydroxide to adjust pH, and purified  water. Benzalkonium chloride 0.01% is added as 
preservative.  
1.2 Preclinical and Human Data  
For complete information on the preclinical studies performed, please see the Investigator’s 
Brochure.  
 
H1337, in the first human trial (ALY337 -201) was generally well tolerated. Instillation site pain, 
instillation site erythema, and vision blurred were reported, usually mild in severity without an 
apparent dose -response.; instillation site erythema, blurre d vision, and muscle strain were 
reported in 3 subjects at moderated intensity.  
 
1.3 Risk/Benefits  
Based on the results of ALY337 -201, the first human trial, the risk/benefit ratio for this trial 
appears acceptable.  Refer to the Investigator’s Brochure for complete information on prior 
studies performed  with H1337 . 
1.4 Dose Rationale   
Ocular PK data  in rabbit s and monkey s confirm ed that H-1337  exhibits dose -related effects and 
can reduce IOP  for up wards  of 8-12 hours.  The c linical dose s, treatment period (28 days), and 
dosing regimen (BID) are expected to have an acceptable safety profile  and have been selected 
based on preclinical toxicology data .  The total daily administered dose of H-1337  in human 
subjects will be approximately 1.72 mg/day (or 0.03 mg/kg/day  based on a 60-kg individual ) 
when administered twice daily in both eyes at the maximal concentration  of 1.0%.  
In a previous clinical study, 3 concentrations of H -1337 Ophthalmic Solution (0.06%, 0.02% and 
0.6%) dosed twice -daily (b.i.d.) provided similar ocular hypotensive outcomes .  In the present 
study, a high concentration  of 1.0% is planned to be used both once (q.d.) and twice  (b.i.d.) -
daily.  The dose is supported by [CONTACT_358492].  T he highest dose from the previous 
study (0.6%, b.i.d.) , as well as a positive marketed control, timolol ophthalmic solution 0.5%, 
b.i.d. , will be included for comparison . 
1.[ADDRESS_447181]  
This study will be conducted in accordance with current US FDA regulations, International 
Conference on Harmonization (ICH) guidelines, Good Clinical Practice (GCP) standards, the 
Declaration of Helsinki, and local ethical and legal requirements.

Study population will include subjects of either sex and of any race/ethnicity over 18  years of 
age with a diagnos is of bilateral  primary open -angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension.  
2. STUDY  OBJECTIVES   
Primary Objective:  
• Evaluate the ocular hypotensive efficacy of 3 dose regimens of H -1337 compared to timolol 
maleate 0.5% in subjects with POAG or OHT treated for up to 28 days.   
 
Secondary Objectives:  
• Evaluate the local ocular and systemic safety of 3 dose regimens of H -1337.  
 
Exploratory Objectives:  
• •Evaluate the efficacy of diurnal IOP measurements of 3 dose regimens of H -1337 compared 
to timolol 0.5%.  
3. STUDY  DESIGN  
3.1 Study Design  
The trial will evaluate the safety and efficacy of 3 dose regimens of H -1337 (0.6% b.i.d., 1.0% 
b.i.d. and 1.0% q.a.m., and timolol maleate (0.5%, b.i.d.) OU for 28 days  (± 2-day allowable 
window for Day 28) . 
 
Approximately 200 subjects  will be  randomized and dosed for 28 days .  The parallel group, 
double -masked, active -controlled study will include the following dosing cohorts:  
 
• H-1337 0.6% Ophthalmic Solution b.i.d. (n=50)  
• H-1337 1.0% Ophthalmic Solution b.i.d. (n=50)  
• H-1337 1.0% Ophthalmic Solution q.a.m. and H -1337 placebo q.p.m. (n=50)  
• Timolol 0.5% Ophthalmic Solution b.i.d (n=50)  
 
3.2 Randomization  
H-1337 and its control  (timolol ) will be packaged in similar bottles  which are concealed in 
identical packaging .  An interactive web response system (IWRS) will be used for 
randomization.  
3.3 Maintenance of Randomization Codes  
The study will be double -masked to reduce potential bias in clinical assessments.  Upon approval 
of D. Western Therapeutics, Inc. , and prior to initiation of the study, an unmasked statistician 
will generate and maintain the randomization codes which are consistent with the study design.

3.4 Trial Treatment  
Subjects will receive one of four dosing arms : H-1337 (0.6% b.i.d., 1.0% b.i.d. and 1.0% q.a.m.  
with H-1337 placebo q.p.m.) , and timolol maleate (0.5%, b.i.d.) OU for [ADDRESS_447184] carton containing 2 pouches  (each pouch containing 1 a.m. and 
1 p.m. bottle ) will be dispensed on Day 1  (Baseline) . The second carton will be dispensed to the 
subject on Day [ADDRESS_447185]’s  participation will  consist of  two phases : a Screening Phase (Screening and 
Baseline Visit  2 and Visit 3 Pre-T0) where subject s will suspend dosing of any current ocular 
hypotensive therapy , and a Dosing Phase, starting on Day [ADDRESS_447186] could participate in the study for a total of up to approximately 11 weeks.  Subjects 
who meet the  applicable  inclusion/exclusion criteria at the Screening Visit will discontinue use 
of any current ocular hypotensive therapy during the washout period.   (Note: At Investigator’s 
discretion for subject’s safety , initiation of a different IOP lowering therapy with a shorter 
washout period is permitted during a long washout period  provided all appropriate washout 
periods are met prior to Visit 2 .) The washout duration will be dependent on the subject’s pre -
study ocular hypotensive therapy.  The table below lists the ap plicable washout durations for 
various pre -study ocular hypotensive medications.  (Note: This table may not be inclusive of all

Following the applicable washout period, the subject will return for applicable 
inclusion/exclusion evaluations on the Baseline Visit ( Day 1) and a subject meeting all 
inclusion/exclusion criteria at Pre-T0 will be randomized to  IP.  Both eyes will be dosed and 
evaluated for safety  throughout the trial .  The study eye is the eye that meets all entry criteria 
including the IOP criteria after washout.  Should both eyes meet the criteria then the study eye 
will be defined as the eye with the  higher Pre-T0 8 am IOP on Baseline ( Day 1).  If both eyes 
have the same Pre-T0 8 am IOP on Baseline ( Day 1), the study eye will be the right eye.  
 
Dosing will be initiated on Day [ADDRESS_447187] will be dosed for up to 28 days during which time they will be monitored for safety, 
tolerability, and efficacy assessments according to the Schedule of Study Assessments and 
Procedures.  
 
The duration of participation for subjects in each stage will be as follows:  
 
Screening Visit: 1 day  
Washout Period: up to 42 days  (+ 7 days ) depending on pre -study ocular hypotensive therapy  
Treatment Period: 28 days  ± 2 days

4.[ADDRESS_447192] Withdrawal and /or Discontinuation  
Subjects are free to discontinue their participation in the study at any time without prejudice to 
further treatment.  The investigator must withdraw any subject from the study at their request .  
Subjects should provide  the reason for withdrawal and confirm whether they are withdrawing 
consent or withdrawing from IP treatment . The investigator or D. Western Therapeutics, Inc.  
designee , may withdraw the subject from IP treatment  for any reason  or if the subject meets any 
of the following  criteria . 
 
• Experiences a serious or intolerable AE that is judged by [CONTACT_358497] . 
• Develops a clinically significant laboratory or other abnormality that is judged by [CONTACT_358498]. 
• Requires a medication that is prohibited by [CONTACT_760] . Contact [CONTACT_358499] a subject  due to use of a prohibited medication before exiting the subject . 
• Does not follow the protocol  procedures , including noncompliance . 
• Is lost to follow -up; every effort should be made to contact [CONTACT_423] . 
• Administrative reasons , including termination of the trial by [CONTACT_1034] , unavailab le for 
follow -up procedures . 
• Experiences glaucomatous progression and /or unacceptable IOP elevation , per the discretion 
of the investigator . 
 
Should a subject’s medical or mental condition change or become unstable during the study , 
such that the ability of the subject to continue in this study becomes compromised or , in the 
investigator’s judgment , their health is jeopardized,  or further continuation is unadvisable,  the 
subject may be withdrawn  from study treatment . 
 
If a subject withdraws or is withdrawn from IP treatment, every effort should be made to ensure 
the subject continue s to participate in the remaining trial visits.  
 
If a subject withdraws or is withdrawn from IP treatment , either at her/his request or at the  
discretion of the  investigator or D. Western Therapeutics, Inc.  the reason for withdrawal should 
be recorded .  All subjects withdrawing or withdrawn from IP dosing , regardless of cause, will 
return within [ADDRESS_447193] dose of IP to complete Early Termination visit assessments ; 
consult the Medical Monitor to determine which  diurnal measurements , if any, are required for 
the ET visit.

4.4 Medication  
During the wash out period between Visits 1 and 2 from prior IOP -lowering therapy, topi[INVESTIGATOR_358473] (CAI) (i.e. , Dorzolamide (Trusopt ®) or Brinzolamide  (Azopt ®) 
will be permitted , but will not be provided by [CONTACT_1034] .  Should a topi[INVESTIGATOR_358474], th e applicable washout for CAIs should be implemented and the CAI 
should be discontinued 5 days prior to Baseline (Day 1). 
 
Current systemic mediations which may influence intraocular pressure should be stable without  
anticipated change s over the course of the trial.  Should a subject’s medical condition change or 
become unstable during the study , such that the change in non -ocular medication that can or may 
affect IOP are added or altered (i.e. , steroids, systemic beta blockers, etc.), the subject’s 
condition should be reviewed with the study Medical Monitor.   If the subject is withdrawn  from 
IP treatment , the subject will continue to be followed during routine trial visits or until he/she  
returns within [ADDRESS_447195] Compliance  
Subjects or their caretakers will administer study medications according to the IP dosing 
instructions  and training  provided , ie; as close as possible to [ADDRESS_447196] will be counseled on IP compliance.  
4.6 Lifestyle Guidance

5. STUDY VISIT PROCEDURES  
All study visit procedures should be conducted in the order listed in  Section 5.1 . 
 
Informed Consent:   Properly executed informed consent (written and verbal) is to be obtained 
prior to completion of any study -related procedures. Subjects must review, sign, and date the 
informed consent document and receive a copy.  The original  document should be retained in the 
Investigator’s Site File (ISF)  or with the Subject’s source documents . 
 
Medical and Ocular History:   Relevant and clinically significant m edical and ocular  history must 
be recorded. This includes  reported changes between Screening Visit [ADDRESS_447197] IP 
administration.  
 
Concomitant Medications /Procedures :  All prescription and over -the-counter (OTC) medications 
and nutritional supplements taken during the study and 30 days prior to the Screening Visit will 
be recorded .  Additionally, all ocular hypotensive medications  taken within 45 days prior to the 
Screening Visit  will be recorded.  Diagnostic and anesthetic eye drops do not need to be recorded.  
All procedures occurring during  the study and 30 days prior to the Screening Visit will be 
recorded.  
 
Randomization :  Randomization will be accomplished using an Interactive Web  Response 
System (IWRS). Site personnel will receive instruction about IWRS access and use.  
 
Adverse Events:   Any events occurring after the first dose of IP will be recorded as an adverse 
event.  At each visit, the subject should be asked questions such as, “How are you feeling?  How 
are your eyes feeling today?  Have you had any changes since the last exam?”  
 
IP Administration and Compliance:   The first dose of study IP will be administered by [CONTACT_358500] T 0 on Day 1 . Subjects will self -dose for the remainder of the trial 
except on study visit days when subjects will be instructed to refrain from self -dosing  prior to the 
visit and the study morning IP will be administered by [CONTACT_358501] ; evening IP will be self -dosed (out of view of study staff) after the 
related IOP measurements . Compliance will be assessed at applicable visits by [CONTACT_358502]. Confirmation of compliant I P dosing the evening prior to 
a study visit must be confirmed or the visit should be rescheduled.  If the subject reports missing 
more than [ADDRESS_447198] 
will be counseled on IP compliance.  
H1337 -CS202 Version 3.0                                                                                                     Version Date: 19 Jan 2024  
D. Western Therapeutics, Inc.  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 29 of 46  
Heart Rate and Blood Pressure (BP) Measurements :  Both systolic and diastolic blood pressure 
should be recorded.  The same type of device and cuff must be used throughout the study on the 
same subject.   An appropriate cuff size with a bladder encircling at least 80% of the upper arm 
should be used to ensure accurate measurements.  
 
Blood pressure will be measured using the most  ideal conditions possible given the subject’s 
medical condition and age.  If possible , the same arm should be used throughout the study.  
Blood pressure should be measured after sitting in a seated position for [ADDRESS_447199]-Corrected Visual Acuity (ETDRS) :  Visual acuity will be performed before implementing 
any procedure that can affect vision (i.e., pupil dilation, tonometry, and gonioscopy).  The m ost 
current refraction within [ADDRESS_447200] corrected visual acuity  
(BCVA)  should be recorded using the ETDRS chart (or a modified ETDRS chart).  If a change 
in BCVA is noted, p inhole may be used to test for the BCVA , but a formal refraction prior to 
dilation should be performed during that visit and/or on the next visit.  The logarithm of the 
minimum angle of resolution ( LogMAR ) scores will be calculated according to the standard 
scoring methodology . A change of ≥ 10 letters may indicate an adverse event and should be 
investigated further by [CONTACT_3433] e investigator and the refraction should be rechecked.  
 
ETDRS Scoring Meth odology :  The best -corrected visual acuity will be measured using an 
ETDRS (Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study) chart.  The test distance must be at the 
distance specified on  the ETDRS chart.  
 
Position the ETDRS chart at the approximate eye level of an  average -height seated subject.  
Mark a spot on the floor ( e.g., with tape) that is the appropriate test distance from the ETDRS 
chart.  The test distance and lighting for the chart must be kept constant throughout the study.  
The subject should be seated comfortably , directly in front of the chart , so that the eyes remain at 
the appropriate distance  specified by [CONTACT_319753] .  Testing always begins with the right eye, 
followed by [CONTACT_358503]. Th e fellow eye should be occluded.   
 
Do not point to specific letters on the chart during the test.  Ask the subject to read each letter 
slowly, line by [CONTACT_4548], left to right, beginning with Line [ADDRESS_447201] reads a number, remind him/her that the chart 
contains no numbers, and request a letter in lieu of the number.   The subject should be told that 
only one chance is given to read each letter, but he/she may change his/her  mind before moving 
to the next letter.   Do not allow the subject to proceed to the next letter until he/she has given a 
finite answer.  If the subject is unsure about the identity of the letter, then the subject should be 
encouraged to guess.  The subject should be encouraged to continue reading even if making 
H1337 -CS202 Version 3.0                                                                                                     Version Date: [ADDRESS_447202] reaches a level where he/she cannot guess, the examiner may stop the 
test. 
 
Each letter read correctly is counted.  The examiner will total each line and the whole column ([ADDRESS_447203]) on the data collection form  and record in the format specified . 
 
Slit Lamp B iomicroscopy:   This will  be performed by [CONTACT_093]'s usual clinical technique  
and must be performed prior to  pupil dilation OU.  Changes and /or abnormalities of the anterior 
segment in the lids, conjunctiva, cornea, anterior segment, and lens will be graded.   Iris color 
will be recorded at screening. Magnification, lighting , and examiner  should be consistent for 
each subject throughout the study . Findings will be graded according to the following scales:

D. Western Therapeutics, Inc.  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 32 of 46 Tonometry ( Intraocular Pressure ):  All IOP measurements must be measured by [CONTACT_358505].  The tonometer calibration should be checked for accuracy within one 
month before screening the first subject for the study.  A Tonometer Calibration Form must be 
completed and filed before the first subject is screened and calibration must be checked monthly 
throughout the study.  Variation within ± [ADDRESS_447205] measurement will be taken and the 
median value will be used for analysis.  Mean IOP values should be rounded up to the next 
whole number if the value is equal to or greater than 0.5  mmHg, and rounded down if less than 
0.5 mmHg (e.g., 24.5 should be rounded to 25, 24.4 should be rounded to 24).  The same 
procedure will be repeated on the contralateral eye.  
 
In order to minimize confounding variables, every effort should be made to acquire all IOP 
measurements for each subject using the same tonometer and approximately at the same time at 
all visits.  Every effort should be made to use the same examiner  for each unique timepoint.  
 
Pachymetry:   Pachymetry will be performed OU at the Screening Visit; results obtained within 
the prior 6 months may be used if no change is suspected.  Central corneal thickness (central 
zone) will be measured with a calibrated ultrasound pachymeter in both eyes afte r topi[INVESTIGATOR_358479].  The subject will be in a seated position and fixating on a target 
straight ahead.  Three measurements will be taken in the right eye  first, and the average will be 
recorded in micrometers (μm).  The same p rocedure is then performed on the left eye .  
 
Gonioscopy:   The gonioscopy examination will be performed OU at the Screening Visit ; results 
obtained  within the prior 6 months  may be used if no change is suspected .  Gonioscopy should 
be performed prior to instillation of dilating or miotic drops, with high magnification, and with 
dim illumination to potentiate visualization of the angle in its natural configuration.  The angular 
width of the angle recess will be graded as an average score representative of all 4 quadrants  
using the grading criteria  below .   
 
Grade Description  (Shaffer System , based on the angular width of the angle recess  [Marsh & 
Cantor, 2005] ) 
4 45 to 35°  angular approach, wide open  
3 35 to 20° angular approach , wide open  
2 20° angular  approach, narrow  
1 ≤ 10° angular approach, extremely narrow  
Slit 0° angle , narrowed to slit  
 
Visual Field Examination:   A visual field will be performed OU at the Screening Visit ; reliable 
results obtained within the prior [ADDRESS_447206] be automated threshold visual fields (i.e., Humphrey [30 -2 or 24 -2] or Octopus equivalent).  
H1337 -CS202 Version 3.0                                                                                                     Version Date: [ADDRESS_447207] (24 -2 or 30 -2) is preferred , SITA fast is also allowed.  The subject’s best 
correction at [ADDRESS_447208] be reliable, defined as those with a) fixation 
losses less than or equal to 33%, b) false positives less than or equal to 33% and c) false 
negatives less than or equal to 33%.  Visual fields are to be performed with a non -dilated pupil 
unless, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], the pupil is so miotic (i.e., < 3 mm) that dilation is 
required.  If the visual field e xamination was conduct ed using dilation at the Screening Visit, 
dilation  should be used for any subsequent visual field examinations  (i.e., if performed at an 
unscheduled visit; visual field testing should be performed during the trial if glaucomatous 
progression is suspected).  Visual field interpretation must be documented and reviewed by [CONTACT_1275], including an assessment of whether the results are normal or abnormal and the 
clinical significance of abnormalities.   
 
Dilated Ophthalmoscopy :  Posterior segment exam will be performed according to the 
investigator’s preferred procedure.  Magnification, lighting, and examiner should be consistent 
for each subject throughout the study.  Ophthalmoscopy should be performed after pupil dilation 
(e.g., 1% tropi[INVESTIGATOR_358480] /or 2.5% phenylephrine). The examination should 
include an evaluation of the vitreous, retina, macula , choroid , and optic nerve  (including the 
absence or presence  of notch es and/or disc or peripapi[INVESTIGATOR_358481] s).  Abnormalities and 
pathologic findings will be graded.  Ocular structures will be graded according to the following 
scale.   
 
Vitreous , Retina, Macula and Choroid:  Examination emphasizes the visual axis.  
 
0 Normal  
1 Abnormal, describe.  
 
Optic Nerve  
 
0 Normal . No damage

2 Moderate optic nerve damage, including cuppi[INVESTIGATOR_358483]  
3 Severe optic nerve damage, nearly total cuppi[INVESTIGATOR_007], only nasal rim or less present  
 
Any new findings (i.e., notch and /or peripapi[INVESTIGATOR_358481]) or deterioration occurring after 
the first IP dose will be reported as an adverse event.  The cup/disc ratio will be recorded 
horizontally and vertically for each examination, and reported in 0.[ADDRESS_447209] : 
Urine pregnancy testing will be required at the Screening Visit for subjects of child -bearing 
potential and at Day 0.  Pregnancy test results must be negative for subjects to continue in the

6. ASSESSMENT OF EFFICACY  
6.1 Efficacy Parameters  
Primary Efficacy Endpoints:  
The primary efficacy measure will be the mean change in IOP from Baseline ( Day 1 ) IOP 
(mmHg) for each group on Day 28 at each matched time  point  as compared to timolol . IOP will 
be measured according to the Schedule of Assessments and Procedures Table.   
 
Secondary efficacy endpoints :  
1. The observed IOP , mean change from Baseline,  and % change from Baseline IOP at each 
matched time point at each visit , and  
2. The mean observed, mean change from Baseline and mean % change from Baseline for the 
mean diurnal IOP at each visit, and  
3. The proportion of subjects with IOP < 18 mmHg at each time  point at each visit, and with the 
mean diurnal IOP ≤ [ADDRESS_447210] diurnal measurements, and data from 
the previous clinical study of H 1337.   
H1337 -CS202 Version 3.0                                                                                                     Version Date: [ADDRESS_447211] 
dose of IP (Day 1 ).  Ongoing A Es at study completion (Day 28) or the final study visit will be 
followed  until the even t resolves, stabilizes, or for [ADDRESS_447212].  
 
All adverse events (serious and non -serious) must be documented  regardless of the causal 
relationship to the study medication.  The severity, frequency, seriousness, duration, relationship 
to IP(s), treatment of event, action taken with IP, and outcome for every adverse event should be 
documented.  
 
Non-clinically significant incremental < 2 unit grade change s in conjunctival hyperemia 
(according to the photographic reference scale provided for the trial) are not required to be 
reported as adverse events ; changes ≥ [ADDRESS_447213] accurate AE terms.   Wherever possible, a specific disease or syndrome 
rather than individual associated signs and symptoms should be identified by [CONTACT_358506].  However, if an observed or reported sign or symptom is not considered a component 
of a specific disease or syndrome by [CONTACT_093], it should be recorded as a separate AE.  
 
Investigators are required to report to D. Western Therapeutics, Inc.  or its representative all 
observed and /or volunteered AEs occurring during the clinical trial (21 CFR §312.64[b]) 
regardless of treatment group or suspected causality to the investigational drug.

7.3 Definitions of Non -Serious Adverse Events  
Adverse events that do not meet the definitions for serious adverse events (SAEs) are non -
serious AEs.  Subjects should be instructed to report any AE that they experience to the 
investigator.   
7.[ADDRESS_447215], or 
precaution.  This includes any experience that:  
 
• Results in death  
• Is acutely life -threatening  
• Requires in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_50891]  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• Requires medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above  
 
Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in 
an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in in -subject  
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  This definition includes 
concurrent illness or injuries, exacerbation of pre -existing conditions and AEs occurring as a 
result of drug withdrawal, abuse or overdose.  Serious a dverse events observed during all periods 
of a clinical study after the fir st dos e of IP (Day 1) have been administered, are to be recorded, 
including those occurring during a period without study medication and whether or not the AE is 
judged to be related to the study medication.

care facility .  
 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4592]:  
 
• Rehabilitation facility  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_57714]  
• Respi[INVESTIGATOR_4594] (caregiver relief)  
• Skilled nursing facility  
• Nursing homes  
• Routine emergency admission  
• Same day surgeries  
 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_358486] a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_2505], clinical adverse event ( e.g., for 
work -up of persistent pre -treatment abnormality)  is not in itself a serious adverse event.   
 
Diagnostic and therapeutic noninvasive procedure s, such as surgery, should not be reported as 
adverse events.  However, the medical condition for which the procedure was performed should 
be reported if it meets the definition of an adverse event.   For example , an acute appendicitis that 
begins during the adverse event reporting period should be reported as an adverse event and the 
resulting surgical intervention should be recorded as a treatment of that adverse event.  
7.[ADDRESS_447216] dose of IP (i.e., 
the final clinical visit ), the Investigator must notify D. Western Therapeutics, Inc.  or its 
representative immediately and within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence by [CONTACT_12550] a 
Pregnancy Report Form and forwarding to D. Western Therapeutics, Inc.  or its representative.  
The pregnancy should be followed to determine the outcome , including spontaneous or voluntary 
termination, details of the birth, and  the presence or absence of any birth defects, congenital 
abnormalities, or maternal and/or newborn complications.   Any complications during pregnancy 
should be recorded as an AE and may constitute an SAE if they fulfill any of the specified 
criteria for a n SAE .  If upon outcome , the pregnancy meets one of the serious criteria ( e.g. 
spontaneous miscarriage, congenital anomaly , or birth defect ), it will then be considered an SAE  
and full details will be requested .  These events will not be included in the clinical study report, 
but will be maintained in the clinical study files.   
7.7 Definition of Unexpected Adverse Events  
An AE is considered an unexpected AE if it is not mentioned in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB), 
or if it is of greater frequency and/or severity than that mentioned in the IB, in the judgment of 
the Medical Monitor.  
7.8 Definition of Relationship of Adverse Event to IP 
The investigator’s assessment of causality must be provided for all adverse events (serious and 
non-serious).  The investigator must record the relationship  and report such an assessment in 
H1337 -CS202 Version 3.0                                                                                                     Version Date: 19 Jan 2024  
D. Western Therapeutics, Inc.  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 39 of 46 accordance with the serious AE reporting requirements , if applicable.  An investigator ’s causality 
assessment is the determination of whether there exists a reasonable possibility that the 
investigational product caused or contributed to the adverse event.   If the investigator does not 
know whether or not the investigational product caused the event, then the event will be handled 
as “related to investigational product” for reporting purposes, as defined by D. Western 
Therapeutics, Inc.   If the investigator ’s causality assessment is “unknown but not related to 
investigational product ,” this should be clearly documented in study records.  
 
In addition, if the investigator determines a serious adverse event is associated with study 
procedures, the investigator must record this causal relationship  and report such an assessment in 
accordance with the serious adverse event reporting requirements, if applicable.  The categories 
are as follows:  
 
0=Unrelated:  No temporal association, or the cause of the event has been 
identified, or the drug, biological, or device cannot be 
implicated.  
 
1=Possibly Related:  Temporal association, but other etiologies are likely to be the 
cause; however, involvement of the drug, biological, or device 
cannot be excluded.  
 
2=Probably Related:  Temporal association, other etiologies are possible, but 
unlikely.  
 
3=Definitely Related:  Temporal association and no other etiologies possible.  
 
7.9 Documentation of Severity of Adverse Events  
All adverse events will be examined to determine severity.  The categories are as follows:  
 
Mild:  Awareness of sign, symptom, or event, but easily tolerated. 
Does not interfere with subject’s usual function .  
 
Moderate:  Discomfort enough to cause some interference with usual 
activity and may warrant intervention.  
 
Severe:  Incapacitating with inability to do usual activities or 
significantly affects clinical status, and warrants intervention.  
 
Life-threatening:  Immediate risk of death.  
 
7.10 Reporting Serious Adverse Events  
SAEs (this refers to any AE that meets one or more of the aforementioned serious criteria) 
occurring after the subject receives the first dose of IP (Day 1 ) will be reported to D. Western 
H1337 -CS202 Version 3.0                                                                                                     Version Date: [ADDRESS_447217]’s final visit or study completion (Day 28), or within [ADDRESS_447218].    
 
SAEs, and all deaths occurring within the study  population , whether considered to be drug -
related or not, will be reported using the SAE Report F orm within 24 hours of knowledge of the 
occur rence to D. Western Therapeutics, Inc.  or its representative .  
 
This can be done by [CONTACT_110191] a completed SAE Report Form to:

reviewing Institutional Review Board/Ethics Committee , according to their reporting 
requirements, and a copy of that report must be forwarded to D. Western Therapeutics, Inc.  or its 
representative . D. Western Therapeutics, Inc.  (or designee) will report all Suspected Unexpected 
Serious Adverse Reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) to Regulatory Authorities within 7/[ADDRESS_447220]’s subsequent course until the SAE has subsided, or until the 
condition stabilizes (in the case of persistent impairment), the subject dies , or within [ADDRESS_447221] whether one or more concentrations of H -1337 are non-inferior to the timolol 
control in the reduction of IOP.  As benefit is represented by a negative number, non -inferiority

1337 minus Timolol) is strictly lower than the non -inferiority margin.  
 
A sample size of [ADDRESS_447222] 90% power to establish non -
inferiority of H -[ADDRESS_447223] (alpha=0.05 ). 
 
Assuming that 10% of the subjects will not be eligible in the ITT population, a total of 50 
subjects per group is required.  
8.2 Statistical Methods  
Continuous and ordinal measures will be summarized by [CONTACT_9086] (n, mean, standard 
deviation, median, minimum and maximum values).  Qualitative measures will be tabulated by 
[CONTACT_33335].  Selected safety measures may be summarized by [CONTACT_358508].  
Summary tables will show the data for each time point (visit and/or time of day as appropriate) 
and will display the observed and change from baseline value.   In addition, percentage change 
from baseline will be summarized for I OP measurements.  
 
Baseline is defined as the last non -missing measurement prior to first IP administration.  
 
A statistical analysis plan will be finalized prior to unmasking the treatment assignments.  
 
An analysis of results will be conducted when the database has been locked and the treatment 
assignments have been revealed.  No interim analyses are planned.  
8.[ADDRESS_447224] Population(s) for Analysis  
All subjects who receive IP and at least one dose will be evaluable for the safety analysis.  For 
efficacy considerations , the primary analysis population will be the intent -to-treat (ITT) 
population.   All randomized  subjects will be evaluable for the ITT analyses.  Subjects who 
receive study  medication, satisfy pre -randomization inclusion/exclusion criteria, and who 
complete at least one on -therapy study visit will be evaluable for a per protocol (PP) population 
analysis.   Individual subject visits and dat a points that do not satisfy protocol criteria may be 
exclude d from PP analyses.  Evaluability will be determined prior to unmasking of  treatment 
assignment s. 
8.4 Significance  and Adjustment for Multiple Comparisons  
Change from Baseline in IOP (mmHg) at Day 28 and Day 1 (on -treatment time points) in the 
study eye is the primary efficacy endpoint. It will be summarized by [CONTACT_358509]. T he differences 
between treatments (H -1337 vs Timolol) will be calculated for each H -[ADDRESS_447225] will be 
used to calculate the LSmean, SE, and 2 -sided 95% CI for the between treatments differences.

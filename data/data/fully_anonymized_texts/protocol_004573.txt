Background: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a prevalent, debilitating, and 
costly psychiatric disorder. Evidenced -based psychotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], including  Cognitive Processing 
Therapy (CPT) , are effective in treating PTSD, although a fair proportion  of individuals show 
limited benefit from such treatments . CPT requires cognitive demands such as encoding , 
recalling, and implementing  new information, resulting in behavioral change that may improve 
PTSD symptoms. I ndividuals with PTSD show worse cognitive functioning  than those without 
PTSD, particularly in acquisition of verbal memory . Therefore, memory dys function may limit 
treatment gains in CPT in some individuals with PTSD . Methods and Analysis:  Here, we 
present a protocol describing the Cognition and PsychoTherapy in PTSD (CPTPTSD) study , a 
prospective,  observational study examining how cognitive functioning affects treatment 
response in CPT for PTSD (NCT# 03641924) . The study aims to recruit [ADDRESS_1149604] standardized assessments  of mood and functioning and complete a  
comprehensive neurocognitive battery assessing  epi[INVESTIGATOR_828540], attention and speed of 
processing, language abili ty, executive control, and emotional functioning.  This study aims to fill 
gaps in the current literature by : 1) examining the specificity of memory effects on treatment 
response ; 2) exploring how baseline cognitive functioning impacts functional outcomes; and 3) 
examining  potential mechanisms, such as memory for treatment content, that might explain the 
effects of baseline memory functioning  on PTSD symptom trajectory. Discussion: If successful, 
this research could identify clinically relevant neurocognitive mechanisms that may impact  
PTSD psychotherapy and guide the development of individualized treatments for PTSD.

INTRODUCTION  
Individuals who experience combat, sexual trauma, and other traumatic events are at 
higher risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_296668] (PTSD) . PTSD is the most common 
mental health diagnosis received by [CONTACT_828555] (OEF/OIF/OND) veterans at 
Veteran’s Administration (VA)  facilities (Seal et al ., 2007), with l ifetime prevalence estimates 
ranging from 8- 20% in OEF/OIF veterans (Hoge et al ., 2006) and  15-30% in Vietnam veterans 
(Dohrenwend et al ., 2006).  Within VA , roughly 20 % of Veterans who  endorse military sexual 
trauma ( MST)  also have a diagnosis of  PTSD ( Gilmore et al., 2016 ). PTSD is frequently chronic  
(Kessler et al., 1995) and is often associated with impaired functioning (By[CONTACT_487757]., 2014).  
Costs for PTSD (e.g., work impairment) are substantial. For example, between 2004 and 2012, 
total expenditures for PTSD rose from 29.6 million to 294.1 million  (Institute of Medicine, 2014) . 
Taken together, the above considerations illustrate the urgent need to develop effective 
treatments for PTSD.  
Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT) is a trauma- focused psychotherapy strongly 
recommended for the treatment of  PTSD (Resick et al., 20 17). CPT is among the frontline 
traum a-focused psychotherap ies recommended by [CONTACT_828556]/DoD Clinical Practice 
Guidelines for the management of PTSD  (Department of Veterans Affairs and Department of 
Defense, 2017 ). CPT is a protocoled cognitive- behavioral therapy  which emphasizes cognitive 
therapy  techniques to help challenge erroneous beliefs developed or strengthened by [CONTACT_828557] . The 
goal of CPT is to help patients recover from PTSD symptoms by [CONTACT_828558],  adaptive beliefs. Unfortunately, a fair proportion of i ndividuals show  limited benefit 
from a standard course of psychotherapy, including CPT, for PTSD ( Larsen et al., 20 19). A 
recent meta -analysis of PTSD psychotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_828541] a majority of patients 
receiving treatments show clinically significant improvements, but most still meet diagnostic 
NEUROCOGNITIVE FUNCTIONING AND CPT  
 
 3 
criteria for PTSD, and non -response rates  are not insignificant (Steenkamp et al., 2015) . To 
develop and refine interventions for individuals with PTSD, there is thus a need to identify 
factors amenable to intervention that may further enhance p sychotherapy outcomes for this 
disorder.  
One factor that may impact psychotherapy in  PTSD is cognitive functioning. 
Psychotherapy requires patients to encode and consolidate new information, organize this 
information into behavioral plans, and remember and execute these plans. Thus, the capability 
to retrieve specific details from one’s p ast and encode/retrieve treatment -relevant skills are 
highly relevant for therapeutic change across most types of psychotherapy (Liggan & Kay, 
1999). Critically, n umerous studies have shown that individuals with PTSD show poorer 
cognitive functioning than individuals without PTSD (Schuitevoerder et al., 2013 ; Scott et al., 
2015) , including deficits in epi[INVESTIGATOR_10682] (Brewin et al, 2007), speed of information 
processing (Wrocklage et al ., 2016), attention (Vasterling et al ., 2002), and executive 
functioning  (Aupperle et al., 2012) , with the largest effects observed in immediate verbal 
memory (i.e., learning) (Scott et al ., 2015).  Treatment- seeking individuals with PTSD appear to 
have greater cognitive deficits compared to community -based PTSD samples (Scott et al., 
2015), highlighting the potential relevance of these deficits for clinical practice. Moreover, 
cognitive deficits are uniquely associated with negative functional outcomes  in PTSD , including 
occupational performance, social functioning, and quality of life (Geuze et al., 2009; Wrocklage et al., 2016). However, despi[INVESTIGATOR_828542], cognitive functioning is only beginning to 
be explored as an influential factor in psychotherapy  outcomes for PTSD.  
Accumulating research reports remarkably consistent effects of verbal memory deficits 
on psychotherapy outcomes in PTSD . In a small study of civilians in trauma -focused CBT, Wild 
and Gur (2008) reported that non -responders had significantly worse verbal learning (i.e., 
immediate memory) at baseline, and that improvement in PTSD symptoms was positively 
associated with verbal learning performance, even after accounting for pre -treatment PTSD 
NEUROCOGNITIVE FUNCTIONING AND CPT

severity and depression. In a larger study of 140 individuals with PTSD, Nijdam and colleagues 
(2015) showed that immediate verbal memory was positively associated with PTSD remission 
and with degree of change in PTSD severity over 16 weeks of treatment. H aaland et al. (2016) 
replicated these findings in a small sample of women veterans, showing that verbal memory at 
baseline was a predictor of psychotherapy response during group therapy with elements of both  
CPT and Prolonged Exposure (PE) , another front -line evidence -based psychotherapy (EBP) for 
PTSD. Furthermore, a study of sleep and nightmare treatment in 94 veterans with PTSD  
showed that individuals with lower verbal learning performance at baseline were less likely to 
respond to treatment (Scott et al ., 2017). Together, the consistency and robustness of these 
findings have prompted recommendations that verbal memory could serve as a useful and 
readily obtainable predictor of psychotherapy treatment response in PTSD (Etkin, 2015). However, limited resea rch has examined the specificity of memory dysfunction in predicting 
treatment outcomes compared to overall cognitive functioning.  
Furthermore, despi[INVESTIGATOR_828543],  no studies to date have 
examined the pathways  by [CONTACT_828559]. For 
example, one pathway by [CONTACT_828560], learning, or implementation, or interfering with a 
patient’s ability to re- contextualize memories. Evidence from research  in substance use 
disorders and depression indicate s that worse executive functioning, memory, and overall 
cognitive abilities are associat ed with poorer recall of treatment information (Harvey et al., 2016; 
Teichner et al., 2002) , reduced quality of copi[INVESTIGATOR_828544] (Alexopoulos et al., 2003) , and 
fewer treatment objectives achieved (Teichner et al., 2001) . However, no studies have been 
conducted in stress -related disorders to determine which aspects of treatment are most affected 
by [CONTACT_828561]. To address this limitation, the proposed project aims to test specific models 
of pathways between memory dysfunction and treatment outcomes by [CONTACT_828562].  
NEUROCOGNITIVE FUNCTIONING AND CPT  
 
 [ADDRESS_1149605], we aim to examine the specificity of memory effects on PTSD symptom  response 
and functional outcomes after CPT . Our primary hypothesis is that v erbal immediate memory  
(i.e., learning) , but not overall cognitive performance, will interact with time to predict PTSD 
symptom changes at post -treatment, such that those with lower verbal learning performance at 
baseline will have less reduction in PTSD symptoms than those with higher verbal l earning 
performance. Second, we aim to determine whether specific treatment -related variables (e.g., 
memory for treatment content , treatment adherence ) mediate the relationship between memory  
functioning and CPT response, helpi[INVESTIGATOR_828545]. Our primary hypothesis for this aim is that treatment recall at the 
treatment midpoint will mediate the association between verbal immediate memory at baseline 
and treatment outcomes. Finally, in an exploratory fashion, we also aim to examine whether 
alternative models of dysfunctional memory in PTSD, including impairment in autobiographical 
NEUROCOGNITIVE FUNCTIONING AND CPT  
 
 6 
memory  (Barry et al., 2018) , emotional memory consolidation  (Durand et al., 2019) , or 
prospective memory (Scott et al., 2016) , might better explain the relationship between memory 
deficits and psychotherapy outcomes. For this aim, our primary hypothesis is that e ffect size 
comparisons will reveal that verbal learning functioning at baseline exhibits larger effects than 
prospective memory, emotional memory consolidation, or autobiographical memory in predicting 
psychotherapy treatment outcomes.  If successful, data from this study could lead to a shift in 
clinical psychotherapy practice for veterans with PTSD and cognitive dysfunction  by [CONTACT_828563], modifiable f actors that may impact treatment outcomes . 
METHOD AND ANALYSIS  
Design  
The Cognition and PsychoTherapy in PTSD: Mechanisms and Functional Outcomes 
(CPTPTSD ; NCT# 03641924) study is a n observational , prospective study aiming to recruit 140 
(n=105 after attrition ; see Missing Data below ) outpatient veteran participants aged between 18-
70 who meet criteria for PTSD.  Veteran outpatients are being recruited from the Corporal 
Michael J. Crescenz Veterans Affairs Medical Center (CMCVAMC) in Philadelphia, 
Pennsylvania.  
Participants 
Participants include veterans who are being referred for EBPs for PTSD (e.g., CPT, PE) 
within the outpatient mental health clinic at CMCVAMC. Participants are referred to the study 
following evaluation from a behavioral health technician, in lieu of transfer to standard outpatient 
psychotherapy appointment for an EBP for PTSD, or by a pre -existing outpatient mental health 
provider. Inclusion criteria includes  meeting DSM- 5 criteria for PTSD via the Clinician 
Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS -5) and being between the ages of 18-70. Exclusion criteria 
includes moderate or sever e substance use disorder (SUD) not in remission for >1 month; daily 
benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_2597]; severe psychiatric illness  (e.g., schizophrenia) ; significant current suicidal 
or homicidal intent, including a specific plan; dementia, neurological disorder, or sever e TBI (i.e. , 
NEUROCOGNITIVE FUNCTIONING AND CPT  
 
 7 
loss of consciousness > 24 hours ); inability to speak or read English ; prior completion of CPT; 
and psychiatric hospi[INVESTIGATOR_21342] 30 days of study entry.  To enhance generalizability among 
our sample of veterans with PTSD, participants are allowed to concurrently take medications for 
PTSD and other mental (e.g. , depression) or physical health conditions or atten d concurrent talk 
or supportive therapy.  
Procedure 
The first recruitment of veteran participants started in July 2019 with recruitment 
expected to be completed in March 2023 . Participants undergo study  screening  to determine 
initial eligibility . Major assessments are conducted with participants at study entry (baseline),  
session 4, session 6, session 8, and at an endpoint assessment  at post-treatment . For a full 
breakdown of all assessments administered at these time points, see Table 1. Baseline 
procedures (before starting CPT) include diagnostic interviews, questionnaires assessing mood 
and functioning, a neurocognitive assessment, and exploratory memory measures. After 
baseline, participants answer questionnaires about treatment expectancy and begin a standard 
cours e of CPT (12 sessions) following standardized protocols (Resick et al ., 2017) with our 
study therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437], who  are all certified CPT providers within the VA healthcare system. Study 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_828546]. Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_828547] , and all 
CPT sessions are recorded for fidelity monitoring.   
Following each CPT visit, participants complete a brief questionnaire about adherence 
and application of treatment (see below) , as well as the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ- 9; 
Kroenke et al., 2001 ) to assess depression symptoms and suicide risk. At CPT sessions 4, 6, 8, 
and 12, participants complete measures of memory for treatment and brief re -assessments of 
PTSD, mood, and functioning.

Note that w ith the outbreak of the novel Coronavirus- 19 (COVID -19) in March of 2020, 
all study procedures have moved to a virtual platform , and verbal consent is being conducted, 
as approved by [CONTACT_828564] .   
Interview Assessments  
During the baseline visit, participants are interviewed by a trained and experienced 
masters -level clinician  using the: 1) Clinician Administered PTSD Scale -5 (Weathers et al., 
2013), the gold standard interview for diagnosing PTSD; 2) Mini International Neuropsychiatric 
Interview (MINI)  for DSM -5 (Sheehan et al., 2015), a semi -structured interview that yields DSM -
5 Axis I diagnoses for major psychiatric disorders, used for both sample characterization and 
exclusionary criteria; 3) Life Events Checklist -5 (Weathers  et al., 201 3a), to properly identify an 
index trauma ; 4) structured i nterview for sociodemographic and medical history to obtain 
relevant demographic information  and medical history; and 5) Ohio State University TBI 
Identification (Corrigan & Bogner, 2007) , a brief structured interview to assess for previous signs 
of traumatic brain injury , for characterization of the sample with regard to head injuries . The 
CAPS is also readministered to each part icipant at the final visit.  
Self-Report Measures  
Two assessments are administered to capture primary outcomes : 1) PTSD Checklist for 
DSM -5 (PCL- 5; Weathers et al., 2013 b) to assess PTSD symptoms ; and 2) the Social 
Adjustment Scale -Self Report (SAS -SR; Weissman, 1999) , a 54- item measure assessing the 
six domains of work, leisure, extended family, romantic relationships, parental, and family unit 
functioning. Two assessments are administered to capture secondary outcomes : 1) the 
Veterans RAND 12 -Item Health Survey ( RAND- 12; Kazis et al., 2006)  to measure health -related 
quality of life; and 2) the WHO  and Work Performance Questionnaire (HPQ; Kessler et al., 
2004)  to measure  performance at work and hours missed from work over the previous month.  
Two instruments  are administered to capture covariate and predictor outcome variables. 
First, th e PHQ- 9, as mentioned previously,  assesses depressive symptoms. Second, the 
NEUROCOGNITIVE FUNCTIONING AND CPT  
 
 9 
Combat Experiences Scales ( CES; Vogt et al., 2013)  is used to characterize participant combat 
exposure.   
Neurocognitive Assessments  
The neurocognitive battery assesses participants’  functioning across a broad range of 
neurocognitive domains using both traditional paper and pencil testing and computerized 
measures  from the Penn Computerized Neurocognitive Batter y (PennCNB; Gur et al., 2001, 
2010) , a widely administered battery with substantial evidence of reliability and validity (Gur et 
al., 2012; Moore et al., 2015; Swagerman et al., 2016) . Specifically, e pi[INVESTIGATOR_828548] -2 (CVLT -II; Delis et al., 2000) , 
WMS -IV Logical Memory Test  (Wechsler, 2009) , and the Penn Face Memory Test  (Thomas et 
al., 2013). Attention and speed of processing is measured using the Penn Continuous 
Performance Test  (Kurtz et al., 2001 ), Trailmaking Test Part A  (Bowie & Harvey, 2006) , and the 
Penn Digit Symbol Test  (Bachman et al., 2010) . Language ability is measured using the Penn 
Verbal Reasoning Test  (Bilker et al., 2014) . Executive control is measured using the Trailmaking 
Test Part B (Bowie & Harvey, 2006) , Stroop Color -Word Interference Test  (MacLeod, 1991) , 
Penn Conditional Exclusion Test  (Kurtz et al., 2004) , and the Letter N -Back Test  (Ragland et al., 
2002) . Emotional Functioning is measured using the Penn Emotion Recognition Test  (Gur et al., 
2001)  and the Penn Emotion Discrimination Test  (Gur et al., 2001) . Performance Validity is 
measured using the Medical Symptom Validity Test  (MSVT; Green, 2004) . Finally, IQ is 
estimated using the Wechsler Test of Adult Reading  (WTAR; Wechsler, 2001) . The entire 
neurocognitive battery is administered by [CONTACT_828565], 
and measures are administered in a secluded and quiet room with adequate space for 
participant and coordinator. These measures are administered during the baseline visit prior to the onset of CPT and after the final session  CPT visit.  
Measures of Treatment Processes  
NEUROCOGNITIVE FUNCTIONING AND CPT  
 
 [ADDRESS_1149606]-  and P atient -Report 
versions of the Treatment Adherence Rating Scale (TARS; Dong et al., 2016). The TARS assesses 1) if the treatment was comprehended and accepte d by [CONTACT_828566] , and 
assesses patient acceptance and agreement with the session content. The TARS is 
administered weekly throughout treatment. Patient recall of treatment content is measured using the standardized Patient Recall Task (PRT; Lee & Harvey, 2015). The PRT is a free recall task 
that has patients recall as many treatment points as they can remember in 10 minutes. The PRT is administered during the midpoint and end of study sessions .  
Treatment expectancy is captured through three measures , including: 1)  Expectancy of 
Therapeutic Outcome (ET O; St rauss et al., 2018 ), a 5-item Likert scale aimed to evaluate 
treatment credibility after the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_828549] ; 2) 
Credibility/Expectancy Questionnaire (CEQ; Devilly and Borkovec, 2000) , a 6-item Likert scale 
measuring treatment expectancies for success ; and 3) Self-Efficacy Scale (SES; Brown et al., 
2014) , a one item questionnaire that asks the participant to rate his or her capability for 
successfully participating in treatment .  
Additional Memory Measures  
Participants also receive three additional measures of memory processes shown to be 
dysfunctional in PTSD, including the Autobiographical Memory Test (AMT; Mark & Broadbent, 
1986), the Emotional Verbal Learning Test (EVLT; Strauss & Allen, 2013), and a modified 
version of the Memory for Intentions Test (MIST; Raskin et al., 2010). The AMT includes twelve 
positive and negative words relevant to depression and anxiety, each presented at once, and 
asks the participant to write a specific memory he or she assoc iates with the provided word. 
Participants are given up to two minutes for each word. The EVLT asks participants to recall 
NEUROCOGNITIVE FUNCTIONING AND CPT  
 
 11 
words presented from four emotion categories (happi[INVESTIGATOR_008], sadness, anger, and anxiety) over 
five trials and delayed free recall. The modified MIST is a performance -based test of prospective 
memory  (i.e., remembering to remember) over 15 minutes with time -based cues balanced by 
[CONTACT_828567] (i.e., physical vs. verbal) and with variable delay periods (e.g., 2 minute, 10 
minute) .  
Data Analysis  
Statistical models used are linear or generalized linear mixed effects regression models , 
and we will use standard residual -based diagnostic approaches to check that model 
assumptions are satisfied (e.g., regarding outliers, observations with high influence or leverage). We will examine demographics  as covariates in analyses to account for possible confounding of 
memory effects by [CONTACT_70166]  (e.g., age) .  
We will use mixed effects models to examine the effects of verbal learning on overall 
PTSD symptom response, and on overall functioning. Verbal learning will be represented by a 
mean z score of CVLT- [ADDRESS_1149607] heterogeneity 
(Fitzmaurice et al ., 2012).  We anticipate that the two primary r esponses can be modeled as 
continuous measures, and that a linear model will fit the data well. If necessary, we will use generalized linear mixed effects models to accommodate skewness or departures from 
normality and linearity. The primary explanatory variables in the models will be baseline verbal 
learning score and time, and their interaction. Time will be coded as a categorical factor 
representing baseline, mid -treatment, and end -of-treatment. The primary analysis will be intent -
to-treat, in which part icipant data is analyzed regardless of dropout or adherence status, as 
mixed effects models accommodate partial data provided by [CONTACT_105] -completers. The main effects 
will test whether veterans with lower verbal learning performance will display less reduction in 
PTSD symptoms (PCL- 5) across treatment, and less improvement in overall functioning 
NEUROCOGNITIVE FUNCTIONING AND CPT  
 
 12 
(measured with the SAS- SR), than those with better verbal learning performance. The 
interaction effects will test for variations in these effects across the treatment phase. A further 
question of interest relates to how prediction based on memory -specific aspects is related to 
prediction based on overall cognitive functioning. To address this  question, we will generate a 
measure of overall cognitive performance from the other elements  in the neurocognitive test 
battery. To facilitate data reduction, and sin ce the PennCNB has been shown to have a strong 
general factor in prior research (Moore, Reise, et al., 2015; Swagerman et al., 2016) , we will 
perform a  principal  component analysis  (PCA) for all neurocognitive measures except for the 
memory measures.  We will examine the strength of the association between this principal 
component and the memory measures to determine whether the first principal component 
appear s to be a reasonable measure of overall cognitive functioning.  
Second, to examine whether mid -treatment levels of treatment engagement (TARS) and 
memory for treatment (PRT) mediate the effects of baseline verbal learning on end of treatment 
PTSD symptoms and overall functioning, we will use a multiple mediator model following  
MacKinnon (2008, Equations (5.2) -(5.4)) to assess effects of verbal learning and the two 
mediators simultaneously. This approach provides the most direct test of our explicit hypothesis 
of mediation but does not make use of the full set of longitudinal data available on the mediators and outcomes. Thus, we will supplement it with a set of longitudinal models, which provide more information on relationships between the time -course of repeated -measures variables. We do 
not measure verbal learning during treatment, as it is not expected to substantially change over the treatment period (Haaland et al, 2016). Thus, we will fit simplified versions of latent growth 
curve models, fitting simultaneous growth curves to mediators and responses, and using verbal learning as a non -time-varying baseline covariate. These models can accommodate different 
numbers of time points, and dif ferent timepoints, across the mediators and responses. Based on 
the number of time points (4 to 6, depending on mediator and outcome), we expect that linear growth curves will be sufficient to describe the trajectories. Our primary model will consider the 
NEUROCOGNITIVE FUNCTIONING AND CPT  
 
 [ADDRESS_1149608] as moderators of memory effects. 
Although exploratory in nature, these covariates will be included as baseline variables in the 
latent growth mediation models.  
Missing Data 
Based on our team’s prior studies, we anticipate a loss of up to 25%  of veterans who 
enroll but do not start treatment (note that this study does not involve randomization) . Thus, our 
planned enrollment is n=140, although the sample size of those who initiate  CPT is expected to 
be n=105.  
Sporadic missing items from a scale may yield a small amount of missing data . We will 
accommodate this in analyses by [CONTACT_828568] a total scale score, based on available items of all participants at that time point. Mixed- effects models and longitudinal mediation 
NEUROCOGNITIVE FUNCTIONING AND CPT  
 
 14 
analyses make use of all data provided by [CONTACT_4317]. The analysis on the combined set of 
complete and incomplete data will be valid if the missing -at-random (MAR) assumption is met; 
in practical terms, this means that a future missed visit can be well- predicted on the basis of 
available data. We will perform sensitivity analyses using selection models (Fitzmaurice et al., 
2012)  to assess effects of plausible models for non -MAR dropout on primary hypotheses. We 
will use mixed -effects logistic regression m odels to predict drop at each timepoint, using 
covariates available at that point. These models will provide estimated probabilities of 
attendance at the timepoints, and we will use (standardized) versions of these probabilities as 
inverse -weights in the a nalyses for the Aims. For nonlongitudinal mediation analyses, we will 
use a multiple imputation approach to generate ten data sets with missing responses imputed for all participants, estimate the models for the secondary hypotheses on each dataset, and combine the results to get final estimates that accommodate the variability due to imputation.  
Power Analysis/Sample Size  
We regard our hypothesis on PTSD symptoms as separate from hypotheses on 
functioning, so we use a 5% alpha -level for both outcomes. Prior data (Haaland et al., 2016; 
Nijdam et al., 2015; Scott et al., 2017 ) suggest a time by [CONTACT_828569], where those with higher baseline verbal learning show greater reduction in PTSD related outcomes than people with lower baseline verbal learning and retain much of the improvement. In the prop osed study, we anticipate that the difference will increase steadily 
through the full treatment phase. We base power estimates on the data of  Scott et al. (2017)  
and our pi[INVESTIGATOR_10299] (Scott et al., under review) . From both of  those data, using z -scored versions 
of baseline verbal learning and the response, a one unit increase in verbal learning corresponded to an additional 0.[ADDRESS_1149609] 80% power for that observed effect for the PTSD 
outcome, and 81% power for slightly larger effects (additional decreases of 0.18 per time 
period) for functioning measures. For mediation hypotheses of Aim 2, we use the methods of 
NEUROCOGNITIVE FUNCTIONING AND CPT  
 
 15 
Fritz and MacKinnon (2007). Using a 5% alpha -level, our attrition reduced sample of 105 yields 
80% power for scenarios with medium or larger effects for the effect of verbal learning on a 
mediator, and the effect of the mediator on the outcome.  
DISCUSSION  
This protocol paper describes an observational prospective study to examine the 
relationship between neurocognitive mechanisms and CPT outcomes in a sample of veterans 
with PTSD. Prior r esearch has identified cognitive deficits in individuals with PTSD , with the 
largest effects in immediate  verbal memory (Scott et al., 2015) . Moreover, secondary analyses 
of PTSD psychotherapy trials have consistently shown that verbal memory impacts treatment 
outcomes across settings and samples. To our knowledge, the CPTPTSD study will be the first to examine whether particular treatment -related variables may mediate the impact of memory 
on PTSD outcomes. Results will identify specific mechanisms underlying the relationship 
between cognitive functioning and psychotherapy outcomes in PTSD, which will inform future rehabilitation interventions that specifically target these cognitive deficits and their downst ream 
effects. Identifying such targets are essential for developi[INVESTIGATOR_828550].  
Limitations  
 This study has limitations. First, the protocol is not a randomized controlled trial (RCT), 
and therefore we will not be able to definit ively know  if symptom changes  during CPT that are 
associated with neurocognitive functioning would have happened absent any intervention . 
However, conducting an RCT was not necessary  to examine most  relationships posed in our 
hypotheses. Second, we have faced numerous challenges with the outbreak of COVID -19, yet 
we have innovated and effectively transitioned much of our protocol to a virtual platform. Lastly, 
our study population is comprise d solely of v eterans, and results may not generalize to the 
civilian population. However, there is evidence that veteran and civilian PTSD rates are similar 
NEUROCOGNITIVE FUNCTIONING AND CPT  
 
 16 
after experiencing similar  traumas (Patel et al., 201 6), and there are minimal differences in 
cognitive functioning in veteran versus civilian samples with PTSD (Scott et al., 2015) .    
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION  
This project was approved and carried out with feedback from  the Corporal Michael J. 
Crescenz Veterans Affairs Institutional Review Board. All subjects will provide written or verbal 
consent prior to enrollment into the study.  
Findings from this research will be disseminated in peer -reviewed journals and scientific 
meetings . We will also communicate results and implications to critical stakeholders in  the 
veteran and PTSD research communities.  Results will also inform t he long- term goal of this 
program of research , which  is to understand the role of cognitive dysfunction in psychotherapy 
treatment outcomes and identify novel targets for rehabilitation (e.g., memory for the content of treatment) that can be translated into clinica l practice. Results from this study may also have 
wider clinical applicability, as they could lead to changes in other psychothera peutic approaches 
for PTSD, as well as other disorders impacting cognition (e.g., traumatic brain injury).  For 
example, “fine- tuned” psychotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_828551], which could be broadly applied to 
help facilitate treatment effectiveness. One novel and promising pathway is to train the rapi[INVESTIGATOR_828552] -as-usual with a memory s upport intervention to enhance patient 
memory for the content of treatment (Harvey et al., 2014) . This intervention involves therapi[INVESTIGATOR_828553], such as repeating information, writing down prescribed treatment recommendations, and providing cues to facilitate retrieval (see Harvey et al., 2014) . 
Initial results from a clinical trial in depression indicate that memory support  improves patient 
recall of treatment content and depression outcomes compared to cognitive- behavioral therapy 
alone (Harvey et al., 2016) . Thus, if our hypotheses are confirmed, this intervention may be 
useful to adapt and test in future studies of CPT for PTSD.

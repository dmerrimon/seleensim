aqueous solution, Dompé farmaceutici S.p.A, Italy, 20 μg/mL vials (Group 1)  
Background information:  
NGF is a polypeptide discovered in the early 1950s by R. Levi Montalcini. NGF acts through 
specific receptors : high-affinity tropomyosin receptor kinase A (TrkA) and low -affinity p75 
neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) , which are expressed not only on nerve fib ers but also on 
anterior segment of the eye (iris, ciliary body, lens, cornea and conjunctiva) and by [CONTACT_58186] , providing the rationale for use of NGF in the treatment of diseases of the anterior segment 
of the eye. Murine NGF (mNGF) , extracted a nd purified from the male mouse submaxillary 
gland , was administered to over 100 patients (45 published) with stage 2 and stage 3 
neurotrophic keratitis (NK) in form of eye drops at a concentration of 200 µg/mL in balanced 
salt solution in two uncontrolled , unmasked, open -label studies. Compelling results were 
observed , with all affected eyes healed from persistent epi[INVESTIGATOR_50024]. Tolerability was good , 
with only mild, local , and transient side effects. As for dry eye disease, administration of NGF 
to dogs with surgically induced dry eye  resulted in enhanced production and functional 
characteristics of tear film, with an associated improvement of ocular surface signs.  
Based on these data, the Company has developed a recombinant  human NGF (rhNGF) 
express ed in E. coli  for the treatment of NK.  
A phase I, double -masked , placebo -controlled clinical study in 74 healthy volunteers , using 
single and multiple dose s of different concentrations of rhNGF eye drops , showed a safety 
profile rhNGF eye drops (Study NGF0 112). A Phase I/II multicenter, double -masked, vehicle -
controlled study evaluated  the safety and efficacy of rhNGF at 10 and 20 μg/mL six times daily  
in 174 patients with stage 2 and 3 NK (study NGF0212)  has been completed in 2015 , 
demonstrating that rhNGF  also was very well tolerated in patients with NK.  
rhNGF, in the same formulation (containing L -methionine) proposed for the present study, has 
been evaluated in a Phase I/II study in retinitis pi[INVESTIGATOR_1802] (RP) patients at the doses of 60 and 
180 μg/mL  (Study NGF0113) , and in a phase II study in NK patients at the same concentration 
of the present study, 20 μg/mL (6 times daily ) (Study NGF0214) . 
An open -label,  uncontrolled study showed that 4-week  treatment with rhNGF eye drops (at 20 
μg/mL and 4 μg/mL concentrations ) was safe and effective in improving symptoms, corneal 
staining , and tear function in patients with dry eye as compared to baseline (NGF0213).

Page 6 of 66 Safety and tolerability of rhNGF at 20 μg/mL six times daily has been demonstrated in both 
NGF0212  and NGF0214 studies.  
Study Design and Methodology:  
The proposed phase II study is a single -center, randomized, double -masked, parallel -arm, 
vehicle -controlled trial, designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of rhNGF eye drops at 20 
µg/ml  concentrati on administered six times daily for 8 weeks in patients with dry eye.  
 
After confirmation of inclusion and exclusion criteria  all eligible patients will be randomized 
at 2:1 ratio to rhNGF or vehicle control treatment with 8 weeks of study treatments 
administration with 4 weeks Follow -up :  
 
 
 
  
 
 
Treatment:  either rhNGF eye drops 20 µg/ml  or vehicle six times daily for 8 weeks.  
 
Follow -up: 4 weeks with no further treatment except preservative -free artificial tears  (use 
recorded in drops/day).  
 
After baseline (day 0), enrolled patients will be evaluated for safety and efficacy at week 4 (day 
282), week 8 (day 56 4) or early exit and at 4 weeks after the end of study treatment  (284 
days). 
 
Treatment Groups:  
Before randomization study eye will determined for primary efficacy and safety analysis as the 
“worse eye” (i.e. the eye with more severe dry eye  – if both eyes are equally worse, the right 
eye will be the study eye ). In all pat ients, both eyes will be treated as specified below:  
 
Group 1: rhNGF 20 µg/mL:  One drop (40 µL) corresponding to 0.80 µg of rhNGF will be 
instilled into each eye six times a day (every 2h), for a total daily dose of 9.6 µg (both eyes, if 
applica ble), for 56 consecutive days.  
 
Group 2: Vehicle:  One drop (40 µL) will be instilled into each eye six times a day (every 2h).  
 
In the 4week f ollow up no further treatment except preservative -free artificial tears, whose use 
will be recorded (drops/day).  
 
Administration of rhNGF six times daily will maintain and improve lubrication of the ocular 
surface since the use of preservative -free artificial tears will be not allowed during treatment 
period.

1.1 Background Information  
1.1.1 Nerve growth factor - overview  
Nerve growth factor (NGF) is a polypeptide essential for the survival and growth of sympathetic 
and sensory neurons , and for differentiation of neurons in the central nervous system. It binds 
with at least two classes of receptors: high-affinity tropomyosin receptor kinase A (TrkA ), a 
transmembrane tyrosine kinase , and low-affinity NGF receptor (LNGFR) , also known as p75 
neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) . 
NGF and TrkA  are expressed in the anterior segment of the eye (iris, ciliary body, lens, cornea 
and conjunctiva), and NGF is released in the aqueous humor. Several pi[INVESTIGATOR_58156], pl aying a crucial 
role in the physiopathology of several anterior ocular segment diseases.  
1.1.2 Chemical and formulation data  
As recombinant human NGF (rhNGF) production in mammalian cells does not achieve 
adequate yields, a manufacturing process based on the use  of recombinant Escherichia coli  (E. 
coli) has been developed. However, because the biological activity of NGF relies on the 
formation of three disulfide bonds , and because disulfide bonds cannot occur in the reducing 
cytosol, the purification and renatura tion of NGF produced in E. coli  is problematic. Based on 
the knowledge that the prosequence increases the yield and rate of refolding of NGF, we have 
developed a manufacturing process starting from proNGF . After expression of proNGF  in E. 
coli, the insolub le protein is isolated in the form of insoluble inactive aggregates (inclusion 
bodies), solubilized  in a strong denaturing agent and subsequently converted into the natural 
conformation, which is determined by [CONTACT_58193] N GF. 
Biologically active rhNGF is finally obtained by [CONTACT_58194]. The DNA sequence of human proNGF has been optimized for E coli expression 
(codon adjustment) and two changes in the furin cleavage site, R101V and K10 3A, have been 
introduced. These two changes are important to ensure a homogeneous rhNGF preparation 
during the process with the mature protein starting with serine 105. 
The investigational medicinal product  (IMP) consists of a sterile isotonic solution for  ocular 
administration (containing L -methionine as excipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]), containing rhNGF 20 µg/mL (i.e. 0.020 
mg/mL) as drug substance.  
1.1.3 Rationale for rhNGF therapy in patients with dry eye  
Dry eye is a chronic inflammatory condition of the ocular surface with seve re symptoms and 
visual impairment, leading to worse efficiency to perform duties for an average of 184 work 
days and resulting in an average loss of productivity estimated in 5,000USD  per year per patient 
(13).

Page 17 of 66 Dry eye results from systemic diseases ( Sjögren's  syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic 
lupus erythematosus , Stevens -Johnson  syndrome, thyroid disease, Bell's palsy), ocular 
conditions ( Meibomian  gland dysfunction , blepharitis, ocular rosacea, corneal dystrophies), 
elective surgeries (refractive surgery, blepharoplasty), eyelid conditions (lagophthalmos, 
entropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394]/ectropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394]), cranial surgeries, side effects of drugs (antihistamines, diure tics, beta -
blockers), ocular injuries and burns, chemotherapy and radiation, aging, menopause , etc. (2).  
Dry eye pathogenesis is multifactorial ; however , a number of common mechanisms can be 
identified: (i) chronic inflammation of the conjunctiva ; (ii) decrease of ocular surface 
sensitivity; (iii) impairment of quantity of tears and/or quality of the tear film, including tear 
film hyperosmolarity; (i v) changes of conjunctival epi[INVESTIGATOR_58157]; (v) corneal epi[INVESTIGATOR_58158].  
Until now, treatment has been limited to the use of artificial tears to temporarily improve 
lubrication of the ocular surfa ce, or the use of steroids to decrease the inflammatory reaction. 
However, chronic use of steroids is associated with severe complications such as cataract and 
glaucoma ( 2). Cyclosporine eye drop therapy for dry eye patients has been approved in the 
[LOCATION_002]  but not in Europe. This drug seems to affect only inflammation and tear film 
production, without any effect on ocular surface sensitivity or the corneal epi[INVESTIGATOR_2130]. On the 
other hand, experimental and clinical evidence suggests that NGF may affect all the pathogenic 
mechanisms of dry eye, potentially restoring ocular surface homeostasis ( 11). 
Indeed, several studies have shown that NGF is involved in the regulation of tear film 
production. In fact, NGF, TrkA and p75, as well as other neurotrophins (NTs) and related 
receptors, ar e expressed by [CONTACT_58195] ; moreover,  NGF has been quantified in 
human tears, indicating that NGF is basally released by [CONTACT_58196] ( 12, 6, 17). These 
data sugg est that NGF  may play a role in the maintenance of the tear film and in its alterations 
in drying ocular surface diseases. Specifically, considering that NGF potentially affects all the 
components of the ocular surface (cornea, conjunctiva, lacrimal gland , and sensory 
innervation), it might play an important role during dry eye disease. In line with this hypothesis: 
1) NGF eye drop administration in a dog experimental model of dry eye increases tear 
production, conjunctival goblet cell density and corneal t ransparency ( 4, 2) an increased tear 
concentration of NGF has been reported in patients affected by [CONTACT_58197] ( 9; 3) NGF stimulates 
glycoconjugate secretion by  [CONTACT_58198], without affecting cell proliferation ( 14). 
1.1.4 Previous experience in humans with rhNGF  
NGF is a polypeptide discovered in the early 1950s by R. Levi Montalcini. NGF acts through 
specific receptors: high -affinity tropomyosin receptor kinase A (TrkA) and low -affinity p75 
neurotrophin  receptor (p75NTR), which are expressed not only on nerve fibers but also on 
anterior segment of the eye (iris, ciliary body, lens, cornea and conjunctiva) and by [CONTACT_58186], providing the rationale for use of NGF in the treatment of diseases of th e anterior segment 
of the eye. Murine NGF (mNGF), extracted and purified from the male mouse submaxillary 
gland, was administered to over 100 patients (45 published) with stage 2 and stage 3 
neurotrophic keratitis (NK) in form of eye drops at a concentrati on of 200 µg/mL in balanced 
salt solution in two uncontrolled, unmasked, open -label studies. Compelling results were 
observed, with all affected eyes healed from persistent epi[INVESTIGATOR_50024]. Tolerability was good, 
with only mild, local, and transient sid e effects. As for dry eye disease, administration of NGF

 Final V ersion 2.0, 27Oct 2016   
Page 18 of 66 to dogs with surgically induced dry eye resulted in enhanced production and functional 
characteristics of tear film, with an associated improvement of ocular surface signs.  
Based on these data, the Company has developed a recombinant human NGF (rhNGF) 
expressed in E. coli for the treatment of NK.  
A phase I, double -masked, placebo -controlled clinical study in 74 healthy volunteers, using 
single and multiple doses of different concentrations of rhNGF e ye drops, showed a safety 
profile rhNGF eye drops (Study NGF0112). A Phase I/II multicenter, double -masked, vehicle -
controlled study evaluated the safety and efficacy of rhNGF at 10 and 20 μg/mL six times daily 
in 174 patients with stage 2 and 3 NK (study NGF0212) ; this study was has been completed in 
2015, demonstrating that rhNGF also was very well tolerated in patients with NK.  
rhNGF, in the same formulation (containing L -methionine) proposed for the present study, has 
been evaluated in a Phase I/II stu dy in retinitis pi[INVESTIGATOR_1802] (RP) patients at the doses of 60 and 
180 μg/mL (Study NGF0113), and in a phase II study in NK patients at the same concentration 
of the present study, 20 μg/mL (6 times daily) (Study NGF0214).  
An open -label, uncontrolled study sh owed that 4 -week treatment with rhNGF eye drops (at 20 
μg/mL and 4 μg/mL concentrations) was safe and effective in improving symptoms, corneal 
staining, and tear function in patients with dry eye as compared to baseline (NGF0213).  
1.2 Study Rationale  
The data reported above, together with the evidence of rhNGF eye drop effectiveness in the 
treatment of patients affected by [CONTACT_58199], make rhNGF a strong candidate for the 
treatment of dry eye disease ( 7, 8, 3). 
As part of the development plan to evaluate the potential efficacy of the rhNGF solution, the 
present exploratory study was designed in order to preliminary evaluate the potential efficacy 
and safety of the IMP.  
For additional information regarding the development of rhNGF, please consult the current IB 
(1)]. 
1.2.1 Dose and Schedule Rational e 
The dose  proposed for this trial is 20 µg/mL (1 drop to both eyes, six time s daily for 8 weeks ). 
In previous studies with Dompé rhNGF in human volunteers , the compound has been 
administered in a wide range of doses after single and multiple administratio ns up to 180 µg/mL 
(three times daily  for five days, one eye).  
In the Phase I /II of the NK stud ies (NGF0212 and NGF0214) , rhNGF administered at 20 µg/mL 
(six times daily  for 8 weeks, one eye)  demonstrated to be safe and well tolerated at this dose 
regime .  
Dose regime at six times daily will also ensure the lubrication of the ocular surface in the present 
study where the use of artificial tears will be not allowed during the treatment period.

4.1 Overall study design  
This is a  Phase II, single -center, randomized, double -masked, parallel -arm, vehicle -controlled 
trial, designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of rhNGF eye  drops at 20 µg/ml  concentration  
administered six times daily for 8 weeks in patients with dry eye.  
Patients will be evaluated at baseline (day 0), week 4 (28 ±2 days), week 8 (day 56 ±4) or early 
exit and 4 weeks  after the end of study treatment  (284 days). 
Eligible patients will be randomized 2:1 to either rhNGF eye drops 20 µg/ml or vehicle six 
times daily and treated for 8 weeks.  
In the 4 weeks following the end of the study treatment, no further treatment will be allowed, 
except preservative -free artificial tears ( use recorded in drops/day).  
The study flow chart is given below:

4.2 Discussion of design  
The study is designed in order to investigate the clinica l efficacy and safety of rhNGF in patients 
with dry eye .  
In the previous studies with Dompé rhNGF in human volunteers the compound has been 
administered in a wide range of doses after single and mul tiple administrations up to 180 µg/mL 
(three times daily  for five days, one eye).  
In the Phase I /II of the NK studies , rhNGF was administered up to 20 µg/mL (six times daily  
for 8 weeks, one eye).  
In the Phase I/II of the NK studies (NGF0212 and NGF0214), rhNGF administered at 20 µg/mL 
(six times daily for 8 weeks, one eye) demonstrated to be safe and well tolerated at this dose 
regime.  
Dose regime at six times daily will also ensure the lubricatio n of the ocular surface in the present 
study where the use of artificial tears will be not allowed during the treatment period.  Treatment

Page 34 of 66 7 DESCRIPTION OF SPECI FIC PROCEDURES  
7.1 Ophthalmological Evaluations  
Ocular evaluations will be performed on both eyes. The assessment will be performed at Day 0 
Baseline Visit, Week 4 Visit, Week 8 Visit and Week 12 Visit. The study eye will be the worse 
eye determined at Day 0 Baseline Visit  (the right eye if both eyes ar e equally worse) . The 
ophthalmological assessment will include:  
7.1.1 External Ocular Examination  
External Ocular Examination  assesses  the motility of the extraocular muscles and the 
appearance and function of the eyelids before the instillation of any dilating or anesthetic eye 
drops.  
7.1.2 Symptom Assessment in Dry Eye (SANDE):  
The Symptom Assessment in Dry Eye (SANDE)  questionnaire is a short questionnaire to 
evaluate both dry eye intensity and frequency by [CONTACT_2329] a 100  mm VAS. The patient symptoms 
of ocular dryness and/or irritation will be quantified on the scale based on two questions that 
assess both severity and frequency of symptoms. A VAS is a measurement instrument that tries 
to measure a characteristic or attitude that is believed to range across a continuum of values and 
cannot easily be directly measured. For example, the amount of irritation that a patient feels 
ranges across a continuum from none to an extreme amount of irritation. From the patient's 
perspective this spectrum appears continuous (i.e. their  irritation does not take discrete jumps, 
as a categorization of none, mild, moderate and severe would suggest). It was to capture this 
idea of an underlying continuum that the VAS was devised.  
For the assessment, the patients mark on the 100 mm VAS line the point that they feel represents 
their perception of their current state. The VAS score is determined by [CONTACT_58215]. The SANDE scores will 
be then evaluated for the 2 q uestions severity (0 -100) and frequency (0 -100).  
7.1.[ADDRESS_63495] corrected distance visual acuity (BCDVA):  
Refraction and visual acuity measurements will be performed for all patients by [CONTACT_58216]. The name [CONTACT_58258]’s visual acuity (VA) worksheet (provided by [CONTACT_1034]) at each 
visit. Refraction should be conducted prior to visual acuity testing to obtain best -corrected 
vision as described below. Best -corrected visual ac uity is measured at all trial visits using 
standard charts, lighting, and procedures. Best correction is determined by [CONTACT_58217] r refraction as described below.  
CONFIDENTIAL  
Study protocol  
 Final V ersion 2.0, 27Oct 2016   
Page 35 of 66 Equipment  
Refraction equipment req uired includes:  
 Retroilluminated Light box and ETDRS 4 meter distance acuity chart set  
 Trial lens frames  
 Trial lens set with plus or minus cylinder lenses  
 Jackson cross -cylinders of 0.25, 0.50, and 1.00 diopters  
 Pi[INVESTIGATOR_58163]  
 Tissues or eye pads and tape  
 A 1 meter rigid measuring stick  
Visual acuity charts:  Chart 1 is used for testing the visual acuity of the RIGHT eye; Chart 2 for 
testing the LEFT eye; and Chart R (or 3) for refraction only. Patients should not be allowed to 
see any of the charts before the examination .  
A distance of 4 meters  is required between the patient’s eyes and the visual acuity chart. With 
the box light off, not more than 15 foot -candles of light (161.4 Lux) should fall on the center  of 
the chart. To measure the amount of light, the room is set up for visual acuity testing, but with 
the box light off. The light meter  is placed at the fourth line from the top of the chart, with its 
back against the chart and the reading is taken. If more than one line a vailable for testing visual 
acuity, the visual acuity of an individual patient should be measured in the same line at each 
visit, if possible. If different lines are used to test visual acuity, they must each meet the same 
standards.  
Retroilluminated ETDR S charts  are used in this trial. The illuminator box will be either wall -
mounted or mounted on a stand. The light box should be mounted at a height such that the top 
of the third row letter is 49 + [ADDRESS_63496]. Each tube is partly covered by a 14 -inch fenestrated sleeve, which is centered on the 
tube and open in the back . This serves as a “baffle” to produce even illumination over the testin g 
chart. Because the illumination of fluorescent tubes diminishes by [ADDRESS_63497] 100 
hours and by [CONTACT_20904] 5 percent during the next 2000 hours, new tubes should be kept on for 4 
days (96 hours) continuously, and should be replaced once a yea r. 
A sticker should be placed on the back of the light box, indicating the date when the present 
tubes were installed. A spare set of burned in bulbs should be available on site.  
Detailed instructions for VA assessment  
As a reminder, Charts 1, 2 and R (or  3) are used for testing the right eye, left eye, and refraction, 
respectively. Patients should not see the charts until the test begins. The lens correction from 
the patient ’s refraction should be in the trial frame worn by [CONTACT_102].  
All eyes must be tested at [ADDRESS_63498] letter read and totals each line and the whole column ([ADDRESS_63499]) 
on the provided VA worksheet. An X is put through letters read incorrectly. Letters, for which 
no guess was attempted, are not marked. When a patient reaches a level where he/she cannot 
guess, the examiner may stop the test, provided that the  patient has made errors on previous 
guesses, which is a clear indication that the best visual acuity has been obtained.  
When a patient cannot read at least 20 letters on the chart at 4 meters , the patient is tested at 1 
meter . The distance from the patie nt to the chart should be measured again using the rigid one 
meter  stick. The distance is measured from the outer canthus to the center of the fourth letter 
(right eye) or the second letter (left eye) of the third line of the chart. The spherical correctio n 
in the trial frame should be changed by [CONTACT_1583] +0.[ADDRESS_63500] distance. The 
patient may fixate eccentrically or turn or shake his/her head to improve visual acuity. Particular 
care should be taken to make sure the patient does not m ove forward when testing at 1 meter . 
The patient should be reminded to blink.  
The examiner should not tell the patient if a letter was identified correctly. The patient may be 
encouraged by [CONTACT_58218], such as “good ,” “next ,” and “OK .”  
The examiner should not stand close to the chart during testing. Attention should be focused on 
the patient and the VA worksheet. If the patient has difficulty locating the next line to read, the 
examiner may go up to the chart and point briefly to the next line to be read, but then must 
move away from the chart.  
When [ADDRESS_63501] at 4 meters  plus 30 (refer to the VA worksheet). The patient gets 
credit for the [ADDRESS_63502] to read them. Otherwise, the 
visual acuity score is the number of letters read correctly at 1 meter  plus the number, if any, 
read at 4 meters . If no letters are read correctly at either 4.0 meters  or 1 meter, then the visual 
acuity score is recorded as “0 .” 
7.1.4 Slit-lamp examination (SLE)  
The Slit-lamp  examination (SLE)  must be performed before the instillation of any dilating or 
anesthetic eye drops or the fluorescein agent.  
The patient will be seated at the slit-lamp  while being examined. Grading of the eyelids, lashes, 
conjunctiva, cornea, lens, iris and anterior chamber will be done according to the following 
scales:

Corneal findings of interest on the SLE include the horizontal diameter of the cornea (m easured 
in mm at the time of the SLE using a ruler).  
Relevant findings of the SLE will be entered in the eCRF.  
7.1.5 Tear Film Break -up Time (TFBUT)  
Patients with a Tear Film Break -up Time TFBUT test ≤ 10 in the study eye (study eye) at the 
screening visit are eligible for enrollment . 
TFBUT will be measured by [CONTACT_58219] -up. The TFBUT will be 
performed after instillation of 5 l of 2% preservative -free sodium fluorescein solution into the 
inferio r conjunctival cul -de-sac of each eye. The patient will be instructed to blink several times 
to thoroughly mix the fluorescein with the tear film. In order to achieve maximum fluorescence, 
the examiner should wait approximately 30 seconds after instillatio n before evaluating TFBUT. 
With the aid of a slit lamp at 10X magnification using cobalt blue illumination, the examiner 
will monitor the integrity of the tear film, noting the time it takes to form lacunae (clear spaces 
in the tear film) from the time tha t the eye is opened after the last blink. This measurement will 
be performed within [ADDRESS_63503] I (without anesthesia ) 
Patients with a Schirmer  test without anesthesia  ≤ 10 mm/5 minutes in the worse  eye (study 
eye) at the screening visit are eligible for enrollment . 
This test will be performed to measure aqueous tear secretion prior to the instillation of any 
dilating or eye drops. Both eyes may be tested at the same time.  
This test will be conducte d in a dimly lit room. While the patient looks upwards, the lower lid 
will be drawn gently downwards and temporally. The rounded bent end of a sterile strip will be 
inserted into the lower conjunctival sac over the temporal one -third of the lower eyelid ma rgin. 
The test should be done without touching directly the Schirmer test strip with the fingers to 
avoid contamination of skin oils. The patients will be instructed to close their eyes gently.  
After [ADDRESS_63504] strip will be removed and the length of the tear 
absorption on the strip will be measured (millimeters/5 minutes).  
The wetting distance at 5 minutes for each eye will be recorded in the eCRF.  
7.1.7 Ocular surface staining (NEI score - Lissamine green  and fluorescein )   
As grading scale of the corneal and conjunctiva damage, the NEI/Industry Workshop guidelines 
will be used ( 10). The cornea is divided into five sec tors (central, superior, inferior, nasal and 
temporal), each of which is scored on a scale of 0 –3, with a maximal score of 15. Both nasally 
and temporally, the conjunctiva is divided into a superior paralimbal area, an inferior paralimbal 
area and a periph eral area with a grading scale of 0 –[ADDRESS_63505] and lead to an underestimation of grading ( 5). 
7.1.8 InflammaDry : 
InflammaDry is a rapid, in -office test that detects MMP -9, an inflammatory marker that is 
consistently elevated in the tears of  patients with dry eye disease.  Using direct sampling 
microfiltration technology, InflammaDry accurately identifies elevated levels of MMP -[ADDRESS_63506] 2016   
Page 40 of 66 8 ASSIGNMENT OF STUDY TREATMENT  
After obtaining informed consent a consecutive  screening number will be  assigned to each 
patient  according to the sequence of study entry, from 001 to 150 .  
8.1 Randomization  
Eligible  patients will be randomized 2:1 to either rhN GF eye drops 20 µg/ml (100 patients) or 
vehicle  solution (50 patients) . 
Each randomized patient will be allocated with randomization number to a consecutive list of 
starting with 1001 onwards.  
Drop outs after randomization will not be replaced.  
8.2 Treatment a llocation  
Each randomized  patient will receive masked study treatment (either rhNGF eye drops 20 µg/ml 
or vehicle  solution ) according to the randomization code and determined by [CONTACT_58220] . 
 
8.3 Masking  
The identity of the treatments will remain unknown to the patient, Investigator , site staff and 
Sponsor’s clinical research personnel until the study is unmasked for the final statistical analysis 
(after data base lock) except in case of specific events th at will require unmasking of the patient.  
The vials containing rhNGF (20 µg/ml) or vehicle  will be identical in appearance , and the 
contents of the vials will be indistinguishable. All staff directly involved in the analysis of study 
results will remain ma sked to treatment assignments while the study is in progress.  
A list of sequential kit numbers will be generated by a member of the CRO SAS programming 
group not involved in the conduct of the study. Each kit number will be randomly associated 
with a treat ment group. Patients will be assigned to treatment in numerical order. A tear -off 
label from the kit box, with the kit number, will be attached to the investigational product 
dispensing log.  
If the Investigator  becomes unmasked for any reason, this informa tion will be recorded on 
source data and in the eCRF of the study, specifying the date and the reason.  
In the event of a medical emergency where the knowledge of patient treatment is required to 
provide the patient with appropriate care, Investigator s wil l have the possibility to unmask the 
treatment assignment for a specific patient.  . The Investigators are encouraged to contact [CONTACT_58221].

masking . Final statistical analysis on the study variables will be pres ented in detail in the SAP.  
10.1 Analysis Sets  
10.1.1  Definitions  
A patient will be defined as screened  after the signature [CONTACT_28513], regardless of 
the completion of all the screening procedures.  
A patient will be defined as eligible  if he/she respects  all the inclusion/exclusion criteria. 
Otherwise he/she will be defined as a screen failure .  
A patient will be defined as enrolled  in the study if he/she is  randomized .  
 Enrolled Set: all enrolled patients. This analysis set will be used for demographic, baseline 
and background characteristics  
 Safety Set (SAF) : all enrolled patients who receive at least one dose of the investigational 
medicinal product at the study eye. This analysis set will be used for the safety analysis  
 Full Analysis Set (FAS): all pat ients  in the FAS who have at least one post -baseline 
efficacy measurement . This analysis set will be used for the  primary efficacy analysis  
 Per Protocol Set (PP): all patients in the FAS who fulfil the study protocol requirements in 
terms of investigationa l medicinal product intake and collection of primary efficacy data 
and with no major deviations that may affect study results. This analysis set will be used 
for supportive efficacy analysis  
Each patient will be coded by [CONTACT_58223] n ot valid for the Enrolled Set, 
FAS, FAS and PP. Patients will be evaluated according to the treatment dose they will actually 
receive.  
10.1.2  Reasons for exclusion from the Full Analysis Set  
Reasons for the exclusion from the Full Analysis Set are the following:  
 failure to take at least one dose of the IMP  at the study eye  
 lack of any efficacy data post enrollment  
CONFIDENTIAL  
Study protocol  
 Final V ersion 2.0, 27Oct 2016   
Page 43 of 66 10.1.3  Reasons for exclusion from the Per Protocol set  
Reasons for the exclusion from the Per Protocol set will be determined in the Blind Data Review 
Meeting and can be  the following:  
 lack of compliance with IMP administration (see § 10.3) 
 exposure to an IMP dose different from the one assigned to the patient  
 missing primary efficacy data  
 failure to satisfy any inclusion/exclusion criteria (eligibility violations)  
 intake of pr ohibited medications  
10.2 Sample size and power considerations  
Sample size was calculated by [CONTACT_58224] a mean difference 
from baseline SANDE  score of -30±20 in the rhNGF groups versus  -20±20 in vehicle group 
(80% power, alpha =0.0 5; 2-sided t-test), considering that the active comparator has already 
proven safe and effective in dry eye patients. Therefore,  the sample size has been calculated 
based on a 2:1 randomization scheme by [CONTACT_51632]:  
n1 = (0.5) × n × (1 + k)  
n2 = (0.5) × n × (1 + (1/k))  
With n1 = active treatment, n2 = vehicle, n = 63, and k = n1/n2 = 2/1=2. Therefore, n1= 94.5 
and n2=47.25. Assuming a 5% dropout rate, a total of 100 patients will be enrolled in the active 
arm, and 50 in the vehicle arm.  
Since this is an exploratory study, no adjustment has been made for multiplicity of SANDE 
parameters, neither has it been taken into account that the actual analysis will be descriptive 
only.  
10.3 Compliance with IMP administration  
The assessment of patients’ complia nce to the IMP will be made by [CONTACT_58225] 0 baseline Visit, Week 4 Visit and the 
number of unused study medication vials returned at Week 4 Visit and Week 8 Visit, 
respectively. Complian ce will be evaluated according to the following formula:  
 
Compliance=  Number of vials dispensed – Number of unused vials returned  
Number of expected days on treatment  
 
Gross n on compliance will be defined as compliance lower than 80% or greater than 120% and 
in case of gross non compliance the patient will be excluded from the Per Protocol Set  (see § 
10.1.3 ). Since this definition does not warrant that the study eye treatment is compliant, if 
indicated the SAP will contain further definitions based upon the diary card information.

Page 45 of 66 11 DEFINITION AND HANDL ING OF AES AND SAES  
11.1 Applicable SOPs  
AE definition, classification and management will follow the Sponsor and CRO SOPs,  based 
upon applicable local and international regulations. A brief summary of AE definition, 
classification and management is reported below.  
11.2 Definitions  
11.2.1  Adverse Events  
Adverse event (AE) means any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug 
in humans, whether or not considered drug related.  (CFR - Code of Federal Regulations Title 
21 Sec. 312.32) . An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associat ed with the use of a 
medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) 
product.  
11.2.[ADDRESS_63508] related to any dose should be 
considered an  Adve rse Drug Reaction (ADR) . Any responses to a medicinal product means that 
a causal relationship between a medicinal product and an adverse event is at least a reasonable 
possibility, i.e., the relationship cannot be ruled out.  
 
The definition covers also medication errors and uses outside what is foreseen in the protocol, 
including misuse and abuse of the product.   For the purposes of IND safety reporting, 
“reasonable possibility” means there are facts (evidence) or arguments to  suggest a causal 
relationship between the drug and the adverse event.  
11.2.3  Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined in line with (CFR - Code of Federal Regulations Title 
21 Sec. 312.32)  as any adverse experience that , in the view o f either the Investigator  or sponsor,  
meets any of the following criteria:  
 Results  in death  
 Is life-threatening  
(NOTE: Life -threatening means that the patient was at immediate risk of death from the 
reaction as it occurred, i.e., it does not include a reaction which hypothetically might 
have caused death had it occurred in a more severe)  
 Requires  inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_58164] V ersion 2.0, 27Oct 2016

that would not have been appropriate in the physician's office or an outpatient  setting. 
Complications that occur during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1084]. If a complication prolong s 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9236], the event is serious. When in doubt 
as to whether “hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” occurred, the event should be considered serious . 
 Results  in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
(NOTE: The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to 
conduct normal life functions. This definition is not intended to include experiences of 
relatively minor medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, 
vomitin g,  diarrhea , influenza, or accidental trauma (e.g., sprained ankle) which may 
interfere or prevent everyday life functions but do not constitute a  substantial 
disruption ). 
 Results  in a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
 Is an important medical event  
(NOTE: A n important medical event is an event that may not result in death, be life -
threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6931] a SAE when, based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, it may jeopardize the patient’s wellbeing and may 
require medical  or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the 
definitions for SAEs. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm 
requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or 
convulsions that d o not result in patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_58166]) . 
 
Pre-planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_58167], not associated with any deterioration in condition are not considered to be SAEs 
(see Par. 11.7.2 ).These events must be recorded in the AE page of the eCRF where a variable 
will be ticked to indicate that they are not SAEs.  
If a SAE results in death, cause of death shall always be specified when known. In  case cause 
of death is not initially available, adequate follow up to seek information shall be made by [CONTACT_3786] . 
11.2.4  Unexpected Adverse Event/Reaction  
An AE or ADR is considered unexpected if it is not listed in the Investigator  Brochure or is not 
listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed and listed in the Investigator  Brochure. 
Events that are mentioned in the Investigator  Brochure as occurring with a class of drugs or as 
anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug , but are not specifically mentioned 
as occurring with the particular drug under investigation are considered unexpected (21 
CFR312.32(a)).

 Final V ersion 2.0, 27Oct 2016   
Page 47 of 66 11.2.5   Suspected Unexpected  Serious  Adverse Reaction  
A Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse R eaction (S[LOCATION_003]R ) is defined as an adverse reaction 
that is both unexpected (not consistent with the applicable product information) and meets the 
definition of a Serious Adverse Reaction.  
The determination of expectedness should be made on the basis of the IB.  
11.2.6  Adverse Events (AEs) of Special Interest (Sight -threatening Events)  
The following adverse events are considered to be of special interest and by [CONTACT_58227] (medically important criteria):  
 AEs that caused a decrease in visual acuity of >30 ETDRS letters or > +0.6 LogMAR 
(compared with the last assessment of visual acuity at the last visit) lasting >1 hour  
 AEs that caused a decrease in visual acuity to the level of Light Perception or worse last ing 
>1 hour  
 AEs that required surgical intervention (e.g., conventional surgery, vitreous tap or biopsy 
with intravitreal injection of anti -infectives, or laser or retinal cryopexy with gas) to prevent 
permanent loss of sight  
 AEs associated with severe int raocular inflammation (i.e., 4+ anterior chamber cell/flare or 
4+ vitritis)  
 AEs that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689] , may require medical intervention to prevent 
permanent loss of sight.  
11.3 Adverse Event (AE) Monitoring  
At each post-baseline visit, after the patient has had the opportunity to spontaneously mention 
any problems, the Investigator  or appropriate designee should inquire about AEs by [CONTACT_58228]:  
 “Have you had any health problems since your last study visit?”  
 “Have there been  any changes in the medicines you take since your last study visit?”  
AEs should be reported for any clinically relevant change in concomitant condition (s) that is 
the result of an untoward ( unfavorable and unintended) change in patient's medical conditions. 
Changes in any protocol -specific ocular or systemic parameter evaluated during the study are 
to be reviewed by [CONTACT_737] . In addition, the patient’s responses to any questionnaire 
utilized duri ng the study are to be reviewed by [CONTACT_737] . Any untoward (unfavorable 
and unintended) change in a protocol -specific parameter or questionnaire response that is 
clinically relevant is to be reported as an AE. These clinically relevant changes will be reported 
regardless of causality.  
In order to collect as complete as possible information in the clinical study database, all ADRs and 
SAEs ongoing at the time the subject’s study participation ends should be evaluated within 10 days 
after the final vis it. After this period, all unresolved ADRs and SAEs will be reported as “ongoing” 
in the eCRF.  
CONFIDENTIAL  
Study protocol  
 Final V ersion 2.0, 27Oct 2016   
Page 48 of 66 11.4 Recording  
Adverse Events:  
All AEs (non -serious and serious) that occur during the course of the study will be recorded in 
the eCRF. Any pre -existing medical co nditions or signs/symptoms present in a patient prior to 
the start of the study (i.e., before informed consent is signed)  should be specified in the 
dedicated e CRF  sections . Subsequent to signing an informed consent form, all untoward 
medical occurrences t hat occur during the course of the study must be documented on eCRF. 
When possible, signs and symptoms indicating a common underlying pathology should be 
documented as one comprehensive event. For each recorded event, the AE documentation must 
include the onset date, outcome, resolution date (if event is resolved), intensity (i.e., severity), 
any action with study treatment taken as a result of the event, and an assessment of the adverse 
event relationship to the study treatment.  
Serious Adverse Events:  
The Investigator  must record all SAEs, including sight -threatening events, occurring at any time 
during the study regardless of presumed causal relationship, on the Serious Adverse Event form  
in the eCRF of the EDC system within 24 hours of learning of the event; information on the 
SAE must also be recorded on a specific Non -Carbon Repeat SAE form (included in the 
Investigator ’s Site File) .  
If the Investigator  becomes aware of a related serious adverse event occurring to a subject after 
the treatment of that subject has ended, this event should be reported by [CONTACT_58229]é . Such “post -study cases” should be regarded for expedited reporting purposes as though 
they were study reports. Therefore, a causality assessment (by [CONTACT_58230]é) 
and determination of expectedness (by [CONTACT_58231]é) are needed for a decision on whether or not 
expedited reporting is required.  
11.[ADDRESS_63509]  
The Investigator  will assess the relationship between the AE and the investigational medication, 
according to the criteria in Table below:  
Table 11.5.1 Relationship of the Adverse Event to  the IMP  
None (Intercurrent 
Event)  An event that is not and cannot be related to the investigational product, 
e.g. patient is a passenger in a road traffic accident or surgical 
intervention performed during the study, but planned before patient 
enrolment into the study  
Unlikely (remote)  Relationship is not likely e.g. a clinical event including laboratory test 
abnormality with temporal relationship to drug administration which 
makes a causal relationship improbable and in which other drugs, 
chemicals or underlying disease provide plausible  explanations  
Possible  Relationship may exist, but could have been produced by [CONTACT_102]’s 
condition or treatment or other cause

Study protocol  
 Final V ersion 2.0, 27Oct [ADDRESS_63510]  and cannot be due to the pa tient’s condition  
Highly Probable  Strong relationship, the event abates upon discontinuation of 
investigational product and, if applicable, re -appears upon repeat 
exposure  
 
An ADR is defined as an adverse experience which is reasonably likely to have been caused by 
[CONTACT_33641]. Events considered “Possible”, “Probable” and “Highly Probable” related to the IMP 
treatment and implying a reasonable possibility, if considered unexpected, will be reported to 
appropriate regulatory authorities.  
11.[ADDRESS_63511] severity grade attained should be reported.  
Specifically, the intensity of events should be classified as mild, moderate, or severe.  
Table 11.6.1 Intensity (Severity) of the Adverse Event  
Mild  Grade 1 - Does not interfere with patient’s usual function (awareness of symptoms 
or signs, but easily tolerated [acceptable]).  
Moderate  Grade 2  - Interferes to some extent with patient’s usual function (enough discomfort 
to interfere with usual activity [disturbing]).  
Severe  Grade 3 - Interferes significantly with patient’s usual function (incapacity to work 
or to do usual activities [unacceptable])

Respective IRB  must also be informed of all SAEs according to local specific  requirements.  
If assistance is needed with the reporting of a SAE, the CRO /Sponsor may be contact[CONTACT_58234]é Drug Safety department, with 
Cromsource MVPVU support for follow -up requests.  
Whenever more than one SAE is observed, the Investigator  should identify which is the primary 
adverse event, i.e. the most relevant one. If other events are listed in the same report, the 
Investigator , along with their relatedness to the Investigational Product, should identify which 
adverse events are serious an d which are non -serious. In any case, the Investigator  is requested 
to record his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_58168](s) with the investigational 
medication.  
An assessment of expectedness and causality of each serious adverse event wil l be performed 
case by [CONTACT_58235]é/CRO. For SAE reported by [CONTACT_58236]é, the Investigator  will receive a notification.  
Depending on the nature and seriousness of the AE, further inf ormation, including copi[INVESTIGATOR_58169], as well as results of laboratory tests performed will 
need to be included in the patients chart. If the patient was hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], a copy of the discharge 
summary should be available,  if possible.  
 Follow -up reports (as many as required) should be completed and faxed/e -mailed 
following the same procedure above, marking the SAE form as “follow up Number XX”.  
11.7.2   Conditions that should not be reported as serious adverse events  
The condition s listed below, that may require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_58170] a patient, are not considered to 
be SAE and shall not be reported as such, but only need to be recorded in the eCRF:  
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_58171].

 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_58173], which was elective or pre -planned, for a pre -existing 
condition that is unrelated to the indication under study and did not worsen.  
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_58174].  
 Treatment on an eme rgency, outpatient basis for an event not fulfilling any of the 
definitions of SAEs given above and not resulting in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063].  
In addition, the following situation shall not be considered SAE:  
 Trial end points  
 Abnormal lab values or test results that do not induce clinical signs and/or symptoms and 
require intervention/therapy, i.e. are not clinically significant.  
11.7.[ADDRESS_63513] also comply w ith the 
requirements related to the reporting of SAEs to the IRB which approved the study. The 
requirements of IRBs vary from one IRB to another; however, as a minimum requirement, the 
Investigator s must promptly report all suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R) 
to their IRB.  
In line with provisions set forth in 21CFR312, Dompé shall notify all participating Investigator s 
in an IND safety report of any suspected adverse reaction that is both serious and unexpected  
and of potential serious ri sks, from clinical trials or any other source, as soon as possible, but 
in no case later than:  
 seven calendar days after becoming aware of the information if the event is fatal or life 
threatening; to be followed by [CONTACT_58237] d ays. 
 fifteen calendar days after becoming aware of the information if the event is serious but 
neither fatal nor life threatening.  
The Investigator s in turn shall notify their IRB.  
If the results of an investigation show that an ADR not initially determined to be reportable is 
reclassified as reportable, the Sponsor shall report such reaction in a written safety report as 
soon as possible, but in no event later than 7/15 calendar days after the determination is made.  
Treatment will be unblinded by [CONTACT_58231]é Drug Safety Pharmacovigilance prior to submission of 
a S[LOCATION_003]R to Regulatory Authorities and only cases referred to active treatment will be 
considered expeditable for regulatory reporting, in line with law requirements.

adverse event as a suspected adverse reaction only if there is evidence to suggest a cau sal 
relationship between the drug and the adverse event.  
 findings from other studies that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the drug. 
Such a finding would result in a safety -related change in the overall conduct of the clinical 
investigation .  
 findings from animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to 
the drug  
 increased rate of occurrence of serious suspected adverse reactions.  
11.7.4   Periodical Reporting to Regulatory Authorities  
Dompé shall be responsible to prepare and submit annual safety reports (Development Safety 
Update Report – DSUR) to relevant Regulatory Authorities.  
11.[ADDRESS_63514] be informed in all cases in which the code was broken and of the circumstances involved.  
Additionally, D ompé Drug Safety may be need to unmask the patient’s treatment if the a 
reported SAE meets criteria of a Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R) in 
order to fulfil  expedited regulatory reporting requirements. Unmasked information shall not be 
disclosed to Investigat ors. 
The identity of the treatments will remain unknown to the patient, Investigator , site staff and 
Dompé’s clinical research personnel and CRO staff (apart from pharmacovigilance) . 
11.9 Follow -up of patients with adverse events (AEs)  
The Investigator  is respo nsible for adequate and safe medical care of patients during the trial 
and for ensuring that appropriate medical care and relevant follow -up procedures are 
maintained after the trial. All AEs should be followed -up to determine outcome of the reaction 
or un til 10 days after the final visit. The Investigator  should follow -up the event until resolution 
or stabilization of the condition. It is the Investigator 's responsibility to assure that the patients 
experiencing AEs receive definite treatment for any AE, i f required.  
If patient was hospi[INVESTIGATOR_58176] a SAE, a copy of the discharge summary is to be forwarded 
to CRO/Dompé as soon as it becomes available. In addition, a letter from the Investigator  that 
summarizes the events related to the case as well as res ults of any relevant laboratory tests also 
may be requested. Further, depending upon the nature of the SAE, Dompé may request copi[INVESTIGATOR_58177]’s medical records.  
For pharmacovigilance purposes, all SAEs should be followed -up in order to elucidate as 
completely and practically as possible their nature and/or causality until resolution of all queries, 
clinical recovery is complete, laboratory results have returned to normal, stable condition is reached 
CONFIDENTIAL  
Study protocol  
 Final V ersion 2.0, 27Oct [ADDRESS_63515] has left 
the study up to  10 days after his/her discontinuation from the study for unrelated SAEs, and without 
timelines for related SAEs.  
11.10  Pregnancy in the clinical trial  
Women of childbearin g potential are not excluded from the study as long as adequate birth 
control methods are being utilized. Women of childbearing potential are defined as all women 
physiologically capable of becoming pregnant. Adequate birth control methods are summarized 
in the protocol’s exclusion criteria.  
Prior to enrollment  in the clinical trial, female patients of childbearing potential and their 
partners must be advised of the importance of avoiding pregnancy during the entire course of 
the study treatment and for the  30 days after the study treatment period ends and of the potential 
risks associated with an unintentional pregnancy. During the trial  (during the study treatment 
period and during the follow up) , female patients are to be instructed to contact [CONTACT_58238]; in the same way, male patients who become 
aware that the partner might be pregnant,  are to be instructed to contact [CONTACT_58239].   
The Investigator  must report every pregnancy  on a pregnancy report form as soon as possible 
(within 24 hours of learning of the pregnancy) to the CRO/Dompé Drug Safety contacts 
reported at Paragraph 11.7.1, even if no AE has occurred, and follow it to term.  
The pregnancy form will be utilized to capture all pregnancy -related information until the birth 
of the child for both the patient and the partner .  
If the  pregnancy is associated with an SAE (eg, if the mother is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_16113]), 
in addition to the pregnancy report form, a separa te SAE report form must be filed as described 
in Section 11.7 with the appropriate serious criterion (eg, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) indicated on the SAE 
report form. Miscarriage, stillbirth and any malformation/disease must be reported as a SAE. 
Any pregnancy leads  to the immediate cessation  of the study treatment .  
11.[ADDRESS_63516] be followed up until the resolution of the AE or as  
instructed by [CONTACT_7195].  
11.12  Overdose  
Cases of overdose (accidental or intentional) which result in serious adverse reactions are to be 
handled following emergency procedures, and reported within 24 hours from the  Investigator ’s 
knowledge of its occurrence. This includes reports related to drug intake through different 
routes (e.g. ingestion), or drug intake with suicidal intentions and consequent drug overdose.  
Since in the preclinical toxicology studies in animal s and in the multiple ascending dose study 
performed in healthy volunteers none of the dose has caused an overdose as documented by

An electronic case report form (eCRF) will be provided for each randomized patient .  
All protocol -required information collected during the study must be entered by [CONTACT_3786] , or desig nated representative, in the eCRF. Details of eCRF completion and 
correction will be explained to the Investigator . If the Investigator  authorizes other persons to 
make entries in the eCRF, the names, positions, signatures, and initials of these persons mu st 
be supplied to the Sponsor.  
The Investigator , or designated representative, should complete the eCRF pages as soon as 
possible after information is collected, preferably on the same day that a study subject is seen 
for an examination, treatment, or any  other study procedure. Any outstanding entries must be 
completed immediately after the final examination. An explanation should be given for all 
missing data.  
12.[ADDRESS_63518] identifier  
All the patients who sign the informed consent form for the present study will be coded with 
“unique subject identifiers” when data are extracted from the study database into the domains 
of the CDISC SDTM model. The unique subject identifier consists of th e 4-digit screening 
number (e.g. S 001, S 002, etc.) and, if applicable, the 4-digit subject study number (e.g. 1001,

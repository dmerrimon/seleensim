2 STUDY SCHEMA  
 
This will be a prospective phase 0 trial.  Up to 15 eligible patients with previously diagnosed or suspected NSCLC planned 
for resection will undergo collection of archived biopsy tissue , imaging (dynamic contrast  enhanced [DCE] -, diffusion 
weighted imagin g [DWI] -, and arterial spin labeling [ASL] magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]), skin punch biopsy, and 
collection of peripheral blood.  Subjects will then receive itraconazole 600 mg PO daily for 7 -10 days, following which they 
will undergo repeat imaging, s kin biopsy, and blood collection.  Subsequently they will undergo surgical resection (see 
Figure 1).  Due to the safety profile of itraconazole when used as an antifungal agent (1-3), all histologic subtypes of NSCLC 
will b e eligible for the trial. The itraconazole dose of 600 mg, higher than an anti -angiogenic dose (4), has been shown to 
inhibit the Hedgehog ( Hh) pathway (5). 
 
Projected Outcomes  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
This is a phase 0 clinical trial.  While clinical data including safety will be recorded, the principal outcomes are 
pharmacodynamic endpoints.  Specifically, we seek to identify: (1) effects of itraconazole on tumor angiogenesis, (2) effects  
of itraconazole on the Hh pathway, (3) biomarker predictors of these effects, (4) the  correlation between itraconazole 
pharmacokinetics and these effects, (5) the correlation between different biomarkers.

1.0 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
 
1.1 Background  
Itraconazole, an orally available azole antifungal in clinical use for decades, has emerged as a promising, safe, convenient,  
and inexpensive treatment for lung cancer.  In preclinical models, itraconazole has demonstrated inhibition of (1) tumor 
angiogene sis and (2) the Hedgehog (Hh) pathway, a critical axis in cancer stem cell development (see Figure 2).  In multiple 
primary xenograft models, itraconazole demonstrates potent inhibition of endothelial cell proliferation and angiogenesis, 
resulting in over 50% reduction in micro vessel  density and tumor vascular area . (6-9)   
 
Itraconazole effects on angiogenesis  
 
Itraconazole may have both mechanistic and clinical advantages over bevacizumab (Avastin), the anti -vascular endothelial 
growth factor (VEGF)  monoclonal antibody approved by [CONTACT_941] U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for advanced non -
squamous non -small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and the only antiangiogenic agent approved to date for any lung cancer 
indication.  In contrast to bevacizumab, itraco nazole appears to affect multiple antiangiogenic pathways, including sterol 
biosynthesis, disruption of cholesterol trafficking, intratumoral induction of hypoxia inducible factor 1 (HIF1α), and inhibi tion 
of VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2) and mammalian target o f rapamycin (mTOR) pathways (6, 8, 10).  Conceivably, an agent 
with multi -targeted effects may be less susceptible to acquired resistance than are drugs with highly selective mechanisms 
such as VEGF inhibition.  Indeed, in clinical settings, bevacizumab has demonstrated modest and inconsistent clinical 
benefit (11, 12), conveyed substantial toxicities (including fatal hemoptysis ), has had restricted clinical use due to safety 
concerns (13), and results in a dramatic increase in the cost of care (incremental cost -utility ratio of more than $500,000 per 
quality adjusted life year [QALY]) (14).    
 
Itraconazole effects on Hedgehog (Hh) pathway  
 
The Hedgehog (Hh) pathway has been implicated in oncogenesis, maintenance of tumor progenitor cells, and tumor -stromal 
interactions in multiple tumor types (15).  These include sporadic cancers such as lung cancer, pancreatic cancer, and 
prostate cancer (16-23), as well as malignancies with Hh pathway mutations such as basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and 
medulloblastoma (24, 25).  Given the longstanding need for therapi[INVESTIGATOR_283052], preclinical studies 
demonstrating efficacy in several cancer models, and cases of dramatic clinical benefit in BCC and medulloblastoma, the 
pharmaceutical industry has recently seen several large -scale efforts to develop Hh pathway antagonists for clinical use, 
including vismodegib (Erivedge), the first FDA -approved Hh pathway inhibitor, indicated for metastatic BCC.  
 
Although inhibitors of Sonic Hedgehog ( SHH ) (26), GLI proteins (9, 27, 28), Smoothened ( SMO ) localization to primary cilia 
(29), and trafficking of ciliary motors (30) have been reported, these antagonists 
have been used only for research purposes thus far. SMO, as a central 
regulator of the pathway and an accessible cell membrane component, has 
been the primary focus for development of small molecule Hh pathway 
inhibit ors (31). Cyclopamine, the archetypi[INVESTIGATOR_283053], was first 
described as a steroidal alkaloid teratogen associated with cyclopic lambs (32) 
and subsequently determined to be a SMO antagonist (33-36). All subsequent 
small -molecule SMO antagonists have been derived from the structural 
scaffold of cyclopamine or des igned to mimic its mode of binding. In addition to 
vismodegib (GDC -0449; Genentech), a number of SMO inhibitors are in 
development and clinical trials, including NVP -LDE225 ([COMPANY_001]), BMS -
833923/XL -139 (BMS/Exelixis), and TAK -441 (Millenium). All of these  inhibitors 
have been designed to be cyclopamine -competitive (36-38). 
 
Itraconazole may have mechanistic advantages over vismodegib and other Hh 
pathway antagonists.    
Due to their limited mechanistic diversity resistance to these cyclopamine -
competitive antagonists has already emerged (39-42). While efforts are 
underwa y to develop new small compounds to inhibit drug -resistant SMO mutants (40, 41), there is no clear time -line for 
when these drugs will enter into clinical trials.  In contrast, UT Southwestern researchers  have demonstrated that

Study Number  – [ADDRESS_345276] from cyclopamine (see Figure 2).  Itraconazole inhibits 
in vivo tumor growth of Hh -dependent BCC and medulloblastoma in mice and inhibits the Hh pathway in human BCC (9, 
43).  We have also shown that itraconazole inhibits the activity of vismodegib -resistant SMO  in vitro and in vivo and has 
inhibitory activity against all other drug -resistant SMO mutants that have been described (see Figure 3 ).  The cyclopamine -

demethylase ( 14LDM) and from its activity as an anti -angiogenic agent (43, 44).   
 
 
 
The Hh pathway appears to be a relevant tar get in lung cancer.   
 
Although most studies investigating the Hh pathway in lung cancer have focused on small cell histology (approximately 15% 
of lung cancers), we and others have demonstrated that transgenic mouse models of non-small cell lung  cancer  (NSCLC, 
approximately 85% of cases) and human NSCLC express high levels of Hh compared to normal bronchial epi[INVESTIGATOR_255125] 
(see Figure 4) (22, 23, 45, 46).  In pancreatic cancer cell lines, Hh path way activation has been noted in tumor stroma.  
Treatment of these mice with SMO antagonists prolonged survival and decreased tumor -associated stroma, sug gesting 
that the Hh pathway may act through a paracrine process (18, 45, 47).  The recognition that Hh targeting may be relevant 
to NSCLC is beneficial not only because this histologic subtype is far more common, but also because early -stage NSCLC 
cases undergo surgical resection, permitting tum or-level pharmacodynamic assessment of target inhibition, as described in 
this proposal.   
 
 
Clinical experience with itraconazole  
 
Itraconazole has a number of favorable characteristics compared to existing antiangiogenic agents and Hh pathway 
antagonists.  Decades of use have shown it to be well tolerated.  Well before the agent was recognized for potential effects 
on angiogenesis, s tem cells, and cancer growth, it was administered to lung cancer patients with invasive aspergillus 
infections without complications (1).  Notably, most of these patients had cavitary squamous tumors and under went invasive 
procedures while receiving itraconazole, suggesting that —in contrast to bevacizumab —this agent may be safely given to 
all histologic subtypes of lung cancer, even in the perioperative period .(2, 3)  Principal toxicities of itraconazole include 
gastrointestinal events (nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea in ≤5%) and concern for drug -drug interactions via effects on 
CYP3A4 (48), PGP1 (48, 49), and protein glycosylation (10, 50).  Importantly, adverse effects of vismodegib —which include 
taste loss, muscle cramps, hair loss, and weight loss —were noted to result in discontinuation of vismodegib tre atment in

6 approximately half of subjects in a pi[INVESTIGATOR_283054] (51).  Finally, in an era of increasing attention to health care costs, 
itraconazole ($ 975/month when dosed 600 mg PO daily) presents a far less costly option than bevacizumab ($8,500/month) 
or vismodegib ($7,500/month). (52-54)     
 
Clinical studies of itraconazole as an antineoplastic agent have been performed in prostate cancer, NSCLC, and BCC.  A 
recent study using itraconazole 600 mg/day for castrate resistant prostate cancer resulted in decreased Hh pathway activity 
that correlated wi th decreased prostate -specific antigen (PSA) levels (5).  In a preliminary phase 2 clinical trial, the addition 
of itraconazole to pemetrexed chemotherapy for second -line treatment of advanced nonsquamous NSCLC resulted in a 
doubling of progression -free survival (PFS) and a four -fold increase in overall survival (OS) (4).  The survival difference 
reached statis tical significance even though the trial was  closed to enrollment before reaching target accrual.  Based on our 
results that itraconazole inhibits the growth of endogenous Ptch+/ -; p53 -/- murine BCC and increases tumor necrosis (43), 
in collaboration with colleagues at Stanford University, members of this study team ([CONTACT_283111]) conducted an 
exploratory open label biomarker proof -of-concept study of itraconazole in BCC ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]), in which itraconazole 
demo nstrated anti -tumor effects and antagonism of Hh pathway (see Figure 5 ).  In that study, treatment with itraconazole 
[ADDRESS_345277] activation, tumor size, and proliferation.  Specifically, 
fourteen untreated patients and 15 patients treated with itraconazole 200 mg PO bid for 1 m onth, all with multiple BCCs, 
were monitored. Patients who received itraconazole showed decreases in tumor growth on average of 23%. The tumors 
showed a decrease in Hh pathway activity by 63% as measured by [CONTACT_283082]1 mRNA levels. Itraconazole decreased cell 
proliferation, measured by [CONTACT_15915] -67 staining, by 45% in vismodegib -naïve subjects ( P=0.04).  In aggregate, this pi[INVESTIGATOR_283055].  
 
1.2 Rationale  
 
Critical to the further development of itraconazole a s a therapeutic agent in lung cancer is a clear understanding of its 
pharmacodynamic profile in patients.  While a small phase 2 trial has demonstrated possible clinical benefit in this patient 
population (4), neither the mechanism nor predictors of this effect has been demonstrated in humans.  The proposed phase

itraconazole.  (B) During itraconazole treatment, tumor area decreased by [CONTACT_5554] 23% (95% CI: 17.2%, 28.1%). 
(C) Unpaired analysis of individual tu mors of treated subjects showed inhibition of Hh path way as measured by [CONTACT_283082]1 
mRNA expression. “ GDC -0449 Treated” patients had been treated with and were resistant to GDC -0449 (vismodegib) 
prior to itracon azole treatment.  (D) Paired analysis of patient Ki67 (proliferation marker) averages and Ki67 tumor 
staining (brown) among itraconazole -treated G DC-0449 (vismodegib) -naïve subjects.   
D 
Study Number  – [ADDRESS_345279] antagonism (5).  The duration of itraconazole therapy is designed to provide sufficient 
drug exposure to reach steady -stage pharmacokinetics in plasma and tissues, and is also expected to be sufficient for targ et 
pharmacodynamic effects, as tumor Gli1 mRNA has been shown to decrease after as little as 3 days of itraconazole 
treatment in a medulloblastoma xenograft model (43).  
 
1.[ADDRESS_345280] time 
in patients, we will determine itraconazole effects on (1) tumor v essel density, (2) tumor perfusion and cellular density, and 
(3) Hh pathway components including GLI1, SHH, and PTCH1.  We will also investigate potential mechanisms of treatment 
resistance (SMO gene mutations, GLI2 and CCND1 copy number, PI3K -mTOR pathway  activation), which have been 
demonstrated in other tumor types but not previously evaluated in lung cancer.   
 
Separately, this will demonstrate the applicability of new molecular and imaging technologies to the clinical study of lung 
cancer.  Specifically, we will evaluate use of RNAScope (Advanced Cell Diagnostics), a technology for detecting Hh pathway 
components that could be applied to patient selection in future clinical trials.  We will also evaluate use of dynamic contra st 
enhanced (DCE) -, diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) -, and arterial spin labeling (ASL) -MRI.  There has been limited 
experience in lung cancer with these start -of-the-art imaging techniques due to concerns for motion artifact.  However, we 
have developed motion correction algorithms to address these limitations.  Such imaging studies might be applied to patient 
selection and/or early determination of treatment efficacy in future trials.

Drug will be provided by [CONTACT_473].  
 
 
3.5  Drug Interactions  
 
Itraconazole reduces the liver metabolism (breakdown) of some drugs, resulting in increased 
blood levels and side effects from the affected drugs. Life threatening adverse effects occurred 
when Itraconazole was combined with cisapride  (no longer available in the U.S.), pi[INVESTIGATOR_3924]  
(Orap), quinidine  (Quinaglute, Quinidex), dofetilide  (Tikosyn), or levomethadyl  (Orlaam). 
Therefore, Itraconazole should not be combined with these drugs. Other drugs whose blood 
levels are increased by [CONTACT_283089]  (Coumadin), tolbutamide, glyburide  
(Micronase, Diabeta, Glynase), glipi[INVESTIGATOR_7130]  (Glucotrol), protease inhibitors [for example, indinavir  
(Crixivan), ritonavir  (Norvir), saquinavir  (Invirase, Fortovase)], midazolam  (Versed), triazolam  
(Halcion), " statins " (for example, simvastatin  or Zocor) and several others. Itraconazole increases 
blood levels of certain calcium channel blockers , for example, nisoldipi[INVESTIGATOR_050]  (Sular) and verapamil  
(Calan). Such combinations increase the occurrence of heart failure .  
 
3.[ADDRESS_345283] few days in adjustment to 
the medication. Other side effects reported include ringing in the ears, fever, sexual performance 
problems, depressi on, drowsiness, or trouble sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007],  severe nausea, yellowing eyes/skin, 
unusual weakness, dark urine, pale stools, numbness or tingling of the hands/feet. Symptoms of 
a serious allergic reaction include: rash, itching, swelling, dizziness, trouble breathing. Symptoms 
such as trouble breathing or ankle/foot swelling could also be due to a rare side effect —
congestive heart failure.  
 
3.7 Dose Reduction or Interruption for Toxicity  
 
Subjects experiencing one or more AEs due to study treatment may require reductions in their 
doses or dosing interruptions in order to continue with study treatment. See section 5.2 for further 
details.

back slightly in an attempt to get the doses back on track.  
 
5.2 Toxicities and Dosing Delays/Dose Modifications  
Any subject  who receives treatment on this protocol will be evaluable for toxicity . Each 
patient will be assessed for the development of toxicity according to the Time and Events 
table ( Section 5.11 ). Toxicity will be assessed according to the NCI Common Toxicity 
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.0. Dose adjustments should be made 
according to the system showing the greatest degree of toxicity .

5.3 Concomitant Medications/Treatments  
 
Itraconazole reduces the liver metabolism (breakdown) of some drugs, resulting in increased 
blood levels and side effects from the affected drugs. Life threatening adverse effects occurred 
when Itraconazole was combined with cisapride  (no longer available in the U.S.), pi[INVESTIGATOR_3924]  
(Orap), quinidine  (Quinaglute, Quinidex), dofetilide  (Tikosyn), or levomethadyl  (Orlaam). 
Therefore, Itraconazole should not be combined with these drugs.  
Other drugs whose blood levels are increased by [CONTACT_283089]  (Coumadi n), 
tolbutamide, glyburide  (Micronase, Diabeta, Glynase), glipi[INVESTIGATOR_7130]  (Glucotrol), protease inhibitors  [for 
example, indinavir  (Crixivan), ritonavir  (Norvir), saquinavir  (Invirase, Fortovase)], midazolam  
(Versed), triazolam  (Halcion), " statins " (for example, simvastatin  or Zocor) and several others. 
Itraconazol e increases blood levels of certain calcium channel blockers , for example, nisoldipi[INVESTIGATOR_050]  
(Sular) and verapamil  (Calan). Such combinations increase the occurrence of congestive heart 
failure due to Itraconazole.  
 
Additionally, i traconazole should be used with caution in patients also taking 
immunosuppressive drugs  such as cyclosporin (due to increased plasma levels of  these  drugs 
when taken in conjunction with itraconazole).  These patient s require extra monitoring by [CONTACT_283090](s).  
Drugs that may decrease itraconazole plasma concentrations  
 
It is recommended that itraconazole capsules be administered with an acidic beverage (such as 
non-diet cola) upon co -treatment with drugs reducing gastric acidity.  
It is recommended that acid neutralizing medicines (e.g. aluminum hydroxide) be administered at 
least 1 hour before or 2 hours after the intake of Itraconazole Capsules.  
 
Study Number  – 122014 -038 
________________________________________________________________________  
12 Coadministration of itra conazole with potent enzyme inducers of CYP3A4 may decrease the 
bioavailability of itraconazole and hydroxy -itraconazole to such an extent that efficacy may be 
reduced. Examples include:  
Antibacterials: isoniazid, rifabutin, rifampi[INVESTIGATOR_283057]: ca rbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], phenobarbital, phenytoin  
Antivirals: efavirenz, nevirapi[INVESTIGATOR_283058], administration of potent enzyme inducers of CYP3A4 with itraconazole is not 
recommended.  It is recommended that the use of these drugs be avoided from 2 weeks before 
and during treatment with itraconazole, unless the benefits outweigh the risk of potentially 
reduced itraconazole efficacy.  
Drugs that may increase itraconazole plasma concentrations  
 
Potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 may increase the bioavailability of itraconazole. Examples include:  
Antibacterials: ciprofloxacin, clarithromycin, erythromycin  
Antivirals: ritonavir -boosted darunavir, ritonavir -boosted fosamprenavir, indinavir,  ritonavir.  
It is recommended that these drugs be used with caution when coadministered with Itraconazole 
Capsules. It is recommended that patients who must take itraconazole concomitantly with potent 
inhibitors of CYP3A4 be monitored closely for signs or  symptoms of increased or prolonged 
pharmacologic effects of itraconazole.

14 5.9 Procedures During Treatment  
 All screening procedures must take place within 21 days of trial registration unless otherwise stated.   
 
 Following screening, pre -study (“Baseline”) assessments will include history and physical exam, 
performance status evaluation, laboratory studies including a blood draw for the cytokine panel archived 
tumor collection from diagnostic biopsy , skin biopsy, and the MRI evaluations (anticipated to last 45 -50 
minutes).  In certain cases when there is a high suspi[INVESTIGATOR_283059], the 
collection of study -required tissue  can occur at the time of the  diagnostic biopsy (see Inclusion Criteria 
4.1.1 ).  
 
 Once on study, itraconazole will be taken twice daily for a total of 10-14 days , After being on itraconazole 
for 7-10 days , “Post -treatment” assessments will include a skin biopsy, blood draw for the PK analyses and 
the cytokine panel, and also MRI ev aluations (anticipated to last 45 -50 minutes). Toxicity assessments and 
laboratory checks will also be conducted during that time.  Following these assessments , itraconazole will 
be continued until the day of surgery .   
 
 At the time of surgical resection, a  tissue sample  (with adjacent normal tissue as per standard resection 
technique)  will be obtained to complete the analysis.   
 
 Following resection, subject s will be followed per standard post -operative procedure.   
 
Samples will be collected at the followin g time points per patient:  
Baseline prior to study treatment:

safety update, please refer to the Itraconazole drug packet insert.  
 
6.1.1  Contraindications  
 
Itraconazole reduces the liver metabolism (breakdown) of some drugs, resulting in increased 
blood levels and side effects from the affected drugs. Life threatening adverse effects occurred 
when Itraconazole was combined with cisapride (no longer available in the U.S.), pi[INVESTIGATOR_3924] 
(Orap), quinidine (Quinaglute, Quinidex), dofetilide (Tikosyn), or levomethadyl (Orlaam). 
Therefore, Itraconazole should not be combined with these drugs.  
 
Itraconazole should not be administered to pregnant patients or to women con templating 
pregnancy.  
 
Itraconazole Capsules should not be administered in patients with evidence of ventricular 
dysfunction such as congestive heart failure (CHF) or a history of CHF.  
 
Itraconazole is contraindicated for patients who have shown hypersensi tivity to itraconazole. 
There is limited information regarding cross -hypersensitivity between itraconazole and other 
azole antifungal agents. Caution should be used when prescribing itraconazole to patients with 
hypersensitivity to other azoles.  
 
6.1.2  Special Warnings and Precautions for Use  
 
Itraconazole Capsules should not be used for other indications in patients with evidence of 
ventricular dysfunction unless the benefit clearly outweighs the risk.  
Study Number  – [ADDRESS_345304] in 
some patients  
 
6.1.3  Interaction with oth er medications  
 
It is recommended that itraconazole capsules be administered with an acidic beverage (such as 
non-diet cola) upon co -treatment with drugs reducing gastric acidity.  
It is recommended that acid neutralizing medicines (e.g. aluminum hydroxide)  be administered at 
least 1 hour before or 2 hours after the intake of Itraconazole Capsules.  
Upon coadministration, it is recommended that the antifungal activity be monitored and the 
itraconazole dose increased as deemed necessary.  
 
Coadministration of i traconazole with potent enzyme inducers of CYP3A4 may decrease the 
bioavailability of itraconazole and hydroxy -itraconazole to such an extent that efficacy may be 
reduced. Examples include:  
Antibacterials: isoniazid, rifabutin, rifampi[INVESTIGATOR_283057]:  carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], phenobarbital, phenytoin  
Antivirals: efavirenz, nevirapi[INVESTIGATOR_283058], administration of potent enzyme inducers of CYP3A4 with itraconazole is not 
recommended. It is recommended that the use of these drugs be avoided from 2 weeks before 
and during treatment with itraconazole, unless the benefits outweigh the risk of potentially 
reduced itraconazole efficacy. Upon coadministration, it is recommended that the antifungal 
activity be monitored and the itraconazole dose increased as deemed necess ary. 
 
Potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 may increase the bioavailability of itraconazole. Examples include:  
Antibacterials: ciprofloxacin, clarithromycin, erythromycin  
Antivirals: ritonavir -boosted darunavir, ritonavir -boosted fosamprenavir, indinavir, ritonavir .  
It is recommended that these drugs be used with caution when coadministered with Itraconazole 
Capsules. It is recommended that patients who must take itraconazole concomitantly with potent 
inhibitors of CYP3A4 be monitored closely for signs or symptoms of increased or prolonged 
pharmacologic effects of itraconazole, and the itraconazole dose be decreased as deemed 
necessary.  
 
Drugs whose blood levels are increased by [CONTACT_283089] (Coumadin), 
tolbutamide, glyburide (Micronase, Diabeta, Gl ynase), glipi[INVESTIGATOR_7130] (Glucotrol), protease inhibitors [for 
example, indinavir (Crixivan), ritonavir (Norvir), saquinavir (Invirase, Fortovase)], midazolam 
(Versed), triazolam (Halcion), "statins" (for example, simvastatin or Zocor) and several others. 
Itracon azole increases blood levels of certain calcium channel blockers, for example, nisoldipi[INVESTIGATOR_050] 
(Sular) and verapamil (Calan). Such combinations increase the occurrence of congestive heart 
failure due to Itraconazole.    Please also see Appendix A: Drugs that ma y have their plasma 
concentrations increased by [CONTACT_283093]  – [ADDRESS_345305]   
safety and care .  
 
All subjects  experiencing an adverse event, regardless of its relationship to study drug, 
will be monitored until:  
 the adverse event resolves or the symptoms or signs that constitute the adverse 
event return to baseline;  
 any abnormal laboratory values have returned to baseline;  
 there is a satisfactory explanation other than the study drug for the changes 
observed; or  
 death.  
6.2.[ADDRESS_345306] or unfavorable medical occurrence in a 
human research study participant, including any abnormal sign (for example, abnormal 
physical exam or laboratory finding), symptom, clinical event, or disease, temporarily 
associated with t he subject’s participation in the research, whether or not it is considered 
related to the subject’s participation in the research.  
Adverse events encompass clinical, physical and psychological harms. Adverse events 
occur most commonly in the context of bi omedical research, although on occasion, they 
can occur in the context of social and behavioral research. Adverse events may be 
expected or unexpected.  
Severity  
Adverse events will be graded by a numerical score according to the defined NCI 
Common Termino logy Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) and version number 
specified in the protocol. Adverse events not specifically defined in the NCI CTCAE will 
be scored on the Adverse Event log according to the general guidelines provided by [CONTACT_283094].   
 Grade 1: Mild  
 Grade 2: Moderate  
 Grade 3: Severe or medically significant but not immediately life threatening  
 Grade 4: Life threatening consequences  
 Grade 5: Death related to the adverse event  
 
Serious Adverse Events  
ICH Guideline E2A and the UTSW IRB define serious adverse events as those events, 
occurring at any dose, which meets any of the following criteria:  
 Results in death   
 Immediately life -threatening  
Study Number  – 122014 -038 
________________________________________________________________________  
19  Results in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_27588]  
 Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
 Results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
 Based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the subject’s health 
and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes 
listed in this definition.  
Note: A “Serious adverse event” is by [CONTACT_283095]. Serious adverse events may or may not be related to the research project. A 
serious adverse even t determination does not require the event to be related to the 
research. That is, both events completely unrelated to the condition under study and 
events that are expected in the context of the condition under study may be serious 
adverse events, indepen dent of relatedness to the study itself. As examples, a car 
accident requiring overnight hospi[INVESTIGATOR_283060] a serious adverse event for any 
research participant; likewise, in a study investigating end -stage cancer care, any 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_30059] w ould be a serious adverse event, even if the event observed is a 
primary clinical endpoint of the study. Refer to the UTSW IRB website at 
http://www.utsouthwestern.net/intranet/research/research -administration/irb/study -
management/adverse -events.html  to determine when a serious adverse event requires 
reporting to the IRB.  
Unanticipated Problems  
The term “unanticipated problem” is found, but not defined in the regulations for the 
Protection of Human Subjects at 45 CFR 46, and the FDA regulations at 21 CFR 56. 
Guidance from the regulatory agencies considers unanticipated problems to include any 
incident, experience, or outcome that meets each  of the following criteria:  
• Unexpected (in terms of nature, severity or frequency) AND  
• Definitely, probably, or possibly related to participation in the research AND  
• Serious or a possible unexpected problem in that the research places subjects or 
others at greater risk of harm than was previously known or recognized. Note: Any 
serious adverse event would always suggest a greater risk of harm.  
 
Follow -up  
All adverse events will be followed up according to good m edical practices.  
  
6.2.2  Reporting  
Local unanticipated problems require expedited reporting, and are submitted to the 
UTSW IRB through the UTSW eIRB and to the SCC DSMC Coordinator.  Hardcopi[INVESTIGATOR_283061]; FDA Form #3500A forms, or other sponsor forms, 
if appl icable; and/or any other supporting documentation available should be forwarded to 
the DSMC Coordinator.  The DSMC Coordinator forwards the information onto the DSMC 
Chairman who determines if immediate action is required.  Follow -up eIRB reports, and

6.3 Steps to Determine If an Adverse Event Requi res Expedited Reporting  
Step 1 : Identify the type of adverse event using the NCI Common Terminology Criteria 
for Adverse Events (CTCAE v4) .  
 
Step 2 : Grade the adverse event using the NCI CTCAE v4.  
 
Step 3 : Determine whether the adverse event is related to the protocol therapy  
Attribution categories are as follows:  
- Definite – The AE is clearly related  to the study treatment.  
- Probable – The AE is likely related to the study treatment.  
- Possible – The AE may be  related  to the study treatment.  
- Unrelated – The AE is clearly NOT related  to the study treatment.  
Study Number  – 122014 -038 
________________________________________________________________________  
21 Note : This includes all events that occur within [ADDRESS_345308] dose of treatment and 
is attributed (possibly, probably, or definitely) to the agent(s) must also be reported 
accordingly.  
 
Step 4 : Determine the prior experience of the adverse event .  
Expected events are those that have been previously identified as resulting  from 
administration of the agent . An adverse event is considered unexpected, for expedited 
reporting purposes only, when either the type of event or the severity of the event is not 
listed in:  
 the current known adverse events listed in the Agent Informati on Section of this 
protocol;  
 the drug package insert;  
 the current Investigator’s Brochure  
 
6.4 Role of the Research Monitor  
 The role and responsibilities of the research monitor will include:  
1. May discuss the protocol with the investigators, interview subjects, and consult with others 
outside the study about the research.  
2.  Shall have the authority to stop the protocol, remove subjects from the protocol, and take 
any necessary steps to protect the safety and well -being of subjects until the IRB can as sess the 
Monitor's report.  
3. Shall have the responsibility to promptly report their observations and findings to the IRB or 
other designated official.  
4.  Is required to review all unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others, serious 
adve rse events and all subject deaths associated with the protocol and provide an unbiased  
written report of the event.  At a minimum, the research monitor must comment on the 
outcomes of the event or problem and in the case of a serious adverse event or deat h, comment 
on the relationship to participation in the study.  The research monitor must also indicate 
whether he/she concurs with the details of the report provided by [CONTACT_458].  
Reports for events determined by [CONTACT_283097] o r research monitor to be possibly or 
definitely related to participation and report of events resulting in death must be promptly 
forwarded to the [LOCATION_003]MRMC ORP HRPO.  
7.0 CORRELATIVES/SPECIAL STUDIES  
 
Angiogenesis endpoints  
 
Tissue (tumor):   The proposed tissue correlates include multiple angiogenic biomarkers which will be assessed by 
[CONTACT_283098].  The Brekken Lab has extensive experience in immunohistochemical 
analysis of human clinical tissue specimens) and in immunohistochemical analy sis of angiogenic biomarkers in 
several preclinical tumor models (55-58).  
 
Blood:   As described previously (59), we will employ a commercially available kit to measure plasma cytokine and 
angiogenic factor levels.  Plasma  will be collected as detailed in “Biospecimen collection and processing.”   
 
Imaging:   Imaging studies will include DCE - and DWI -MRI (both of which are established technologies to assess 
microvessel density and cellularity (60)) as well as ASL -MRI (an exploratory platform to assess perfusion and 
vascular den sity without contrast ).  Motion correction techniques will be employed (61).  Together, these studies 
will take approximately 45-50 minutes per time -point.  Patients may be excluded from MRI examinations for any of 
the following reasons:  
1.  Tumor size may be too small for imaging studies.  
2.  Claustrophobia that would interfere with MRI studies anticipated to last 45 -50 minutes.  
Study Number  – 122014 -038 
________________________________________________________________________  
22 3.  Metal implants deemed at risk for migration during MRI studies.  
4.  CrCl < 45 mL/min (increased ri sk of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis [NSF] from MRI Gadolinium  
contrast).  
5.  Known allergy to MRI contrast.  
 
DCE -MRI. Each consented participant will undergo point of care testing for creatinine on the day of the examination. 
We will employ Gad avist, an FDA  approved macrocyclic agent in order to minimize risk of nephrogenic systemic 
fibrosis (NSF).  DCE -MRI will be carried out on a 3.[ADDRESS_345309] low -angle 
gradient echo sequence (TFE) combined with parall el acquisition SENSE technique. The images will be obtained 
in each patient  so that the tumor moves along the imaging plane based on a method developed in our previous 
work (62) . Images will be acquired after intravenous administration of a standard dose o f 0.[ADDRESS_345310] (Schering AG, [LOCATION_013]) over a [ADDRESS_345311] to image the tumor .  
 
ASL-MRI.  Arterial spin labeling (ASL) has been used extensively to measure tissue perfusion in the brain (63, 64).  
ASL uses endogenous spi[INVESTIGATOR_283064]. ASL in the lung has been developed and evaluated in normal volunteers (65, 66).  However, its 
evaluation in lung pathology has been limited to date,.  We will  measure tumor perfusion using either pulsed ASL 
(e.g. FAIRER) or a high labeling efficient pseudo -continuous ASL (pCASL) (67).  These  approach es offer increased 
labeling efficiency and improved SNR. These characteristics s hould make ASL an attractive non -invasive method 
for measuring both absolute perfusion in lung cancer and changes in perfusion upon treatment.   
 
Image data from all MRI examinations will be stored on a dedicated computer workstation for analysis. Image data 
will be correlated with other pharmacodynamic endpoints (eg, K trans with MVD; ADC with cellularity).   
 
Itraconazole pharmacokinetics (plasma, skin, tumor)  
 
These analyses will be performed at the Clinical Pharmacology & Experimental Therapeutics Center at [LOCATION_007] Tech 
University School of Pharmacy.  The Center laboratory includes a state -of-the-art mass spectrometry core including 
AB Sciex 5500 QTRAP®, AB Sciex 5600 TripleTOF ™, and Agilent 7700x ICP -MS, and specializes in development 
of novel method s of analyses for analytes contained in complex biologic matrices, such as tumor tissue and skin 
biopsies.  The Center is strategically located adjacent to the Simmons Cancer Center to support collaborative 
research initiatives such as the current proposal .     
 
8.0 STATIS TICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
 8.1 Sample size estimate  
 
Paired t -tests or Wilcoxon signed rank -tests will be used to investigate if there is a significant change in microvessel 
density (MVD) and angiogenic cytokine levels from pre -treatment to post -treatment. We will enroll up to [ADDRESS_345312] 90% power to detect a 30% reduction in MVD between the pre -and post -
itraconazole tissue samples, assuming a standard deviation of 25% using a paired t -test with a two -sided 
significance level of 0.05. This is a relatively conservative  estimate of effect size, as itraconazole reduces MVD by 
50-75% in preclinical lung cancer models (6). Up to [ADDRESS_345313] 10 matched pairs of imaging, blood, and tissue data for analysis. In exploratory analyses, we will evaluate 
the association between baseline biomarkers and pharmacodynamic effects of itraconazole.  
 
The planned sample size of 15 patients is consistent with FDA recommendations for human PK 
studies.  Specifically, the number of subjects is projected to provide (1) 20% precision (SEM)  
Study Number  – 122014 -038 
________________________________________________________________________  
23 within PK parameters, and (2) a reasonable understanding of intra -individual variability in 
pharmacokinetic parameters . (68)  
 
Additionally, subjects who miss more than [ADDRESS_345314] of pharmacokinetics (PK) on the pharmacodynamic profile of a drug compound.  
 
The nonlinear mixed effects model will be used to determine the effect of itraconazole pharmacokinetics 
(PK) on the pharmacodynamic prof ile of itraconazole . Post-treatment serum and tissue will be analyzed 
for itraconazole concentrations. Mean serum and tissue concentration -time profiles of itraconazole will be 
plotted on linear and semi -logarithmic scales based on scheduled sample times. For values recorded 
above the upper limit of quantification (ULoQ) or below the lower limit of quantification (LLoQ), the ULoQ 
or LLoQ respectively will be used for any summaries and plots. The individual serum and tissue 
concentration over actual time dat a will be used to derive the pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters by [CONTACT_105] -
compartmental PK analyses using Phoenix WinNonlin 6.1 or higher.  
 
The following PK parameters will be computed:  area under the concentration -time curve over the dosing 
interval (AUC), ob served maximum serum and tissue concentration at steady state (C max,ss), average 
concentration at steady state (C av), calculated as AUC τ/τ, minimum concentration immediately before the 
next application (C min), and terminal elimination half -life calculated from the pharmacokinetic profile (T 1/2). 
Effects of these PK parameters will be compared to pharmacodynamic assay results using nonlinear 
mixed effects model.

Research Office (CRO)  before enrollmen t to study . Prior to registration, eligibility criteria 
must be confirmed with the CRO  Study Coordinator.  
9.4 Data Management and Monitoring/Auditing  
Trial m onitoring will be conducted no less than annually and refers to a regular interval 
review of trial related activity and documentation performed by [CONTACT_114650], which includes 
but is not limited to accuracy of case report forms, protocol compliance, timel iness and 
accuracy of Velos entries and AE/SAE management and reporting. Documentation of trial 
monitoring will b e maintained along with other protocol related documents  and will be 
reviewed during internal audit .   
 
 
 
The UTSW Simmons Cancer Center (SCC) Data and Safety Monitoring Committee 
(DSMC) is responsible for overall monitoring of data quality and patient saf ety.  As part of 
that responsibility, the DSMC reviews all local serious adverse events and unanticipated 
problems in real time as they are reported and reviews adverse events on a quarterly 
basis.   The Quality Assurance activity of the Clinical Research Office provides for 
periodic auditing of clinical research documents to ensure data integrity and regulatory 
compliance based on risk.  
 
The S CC-DSMC meets quarterly and conducts annual comprehensive reviews of 
ongoing clinical trials, for which it is the DSMC of record.  
 
Further detail may be found in the SCC -DSMC Plan .

Itraconazole and its major metabolite, hydroxy -itraconazole, can inhibit the metabolism of drugs 
metabolized by [CONTACT_097]3A4 and can inhibit the drug transport by P -glycoprotein, which may result 
in increased plasma concentrations of these drugs and/or their act ive metabolite(s) when they are 
administered with itraconazole. These elevated plasma concentrations may increase or prolong 
both therapeutic and adverse effects of these drugs. CYP3A4 -metabolized drugs known to 
prolong the QT interval may be contraindicat ed with itraconazole, since the combination may 
lead to ventricular tachyarrhythmias including occurrences of torsade de pointes, a potentially 
fatal arrhythmia. Once treatment is stopped, itraconazole plasma concentrations decrease to an 
almost undetectab le concentration within [ADDRESS_345333] their plasma concentrations increased by [CONTACT_283106]:

treatment with 
itraconazole.   It is recommended 
that the use of the 
drug be avoided 
during and up to two 
weeks after 
discontinuation of 
treatment with 
itraconazole, unless 
the benefits outweigh 
the potentially 
increased risks of 
side effects. If 
coadministration 
cannot be avoided, 
clinical monitoring 
for signs or 
symptoms of 
increased or 
prolonged effects or 
side effects of the 
interacting drug is 
recommended, and 
its dosage be

Appendix B: Biospecimen collection and processing:   
  
Tumor specimens  will be obtained from archived samples of the pre-treatment core -needle biopsy and 
core(s) obtained from the resected specimen at the time of surgery.  To account for intratumoral 
heterogeneity, we will employ image guidance for pre - and p ost-treatment tissue sampling, thereby 
[CONTACT_283107].  Specimens will be divided, with half to be (1) flash 
frozen in liquid nitrogen  (for qPCR for Hh pathway components), and half designated to be (2) fixed in 4% 
paraformaldehyde  (for RNAScope for Hh pathway components and IHC for angiogenic markers).   
 
Blood samples  will be collected in the Simmons Cancer Center laboratory.  Plasma samples with EDTA 
will be collected at specified time -points.  Samples will be cen trifuged at 1,100 × g (relative centrifugal 
force) for 15 min at 4°C for separation of plasma and mononuclear cell layers. Plasma will be stored at 
−70°C. Before analysis, samples will be thawed overnight at 4°C and centrifuged at 1,500 × g to remove 
debri s.  PK time points have been selected to provide sufficient PK data but also to fit within hours of 
operation of this facility, thereby [CONTACT_283108].   
 
Skin biopsies  will be performed by [CONTACT_283109] -described methods. 
(69)  A 4-mm punch biopsy will be performed with a single suture placed after the procedure.  Lidocaine 
will be used to numb the patient skin and antibiotic ointment will be applied to the suture site.  The 
specimen will be flash frozen for RNA procurement (PCR) .

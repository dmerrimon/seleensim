2  INTRODUCTION: BACKGROUND INFORMATION AND SCIENTIFIC 
RATIONALE                                     
2.1  BACKGROUND INFORMATION  
The proposed study is in the field of radiation oncology, where functional imaging will be used to assess the outcome of radiation therapy (RT) for liver cancer patients.  
 
Radiation therapy for liver cancer  
 
Liver cancer is a prevalent public health problem. The number of new liver cancer cases was 
estimated to be 39,000 in 2016. Furthermore, liver cancer was estimated to represent 
approximately 5% of all cancer deaths in 2016. The five- year survival rate of all liver cancers is 
estimated to be 18% [1] . Liver cancer is comprised of intrahepatic bile duct cancers (25%) and 
hepatic cell carcinomas (75%). Since less than 25% of hepatic cell carcinomas are eligible for surgical resection, radiation therapy is a treatment option for many liv er cancer patients [2,3]. 
However , therapy success is suboptimal. Optimization of cancer therapy based on a patient’s 
unique biological characteristics, called “personalized cancer therapy”, is becoming achievable 
[4]. One aspect of the patient’s unique tumor microenvironment is the characteristics of blood 
perfusion. Though there are several imaging modalities that can quantify perfusion, DCE -CT is 
one accessible option. In addition, this study focuses on using SBRT as the radiation therapy 
treatment modality. SBRT delivers radiation therapy over a short time interval (typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], 3 -8 
sessions). This differs from  conventional external beam radiation therapy, where a typi[INVESTIGATOR_908356] 10 to 30 sessions, or more (this is dependent on the total 
radiation dose to the tumor). Historical experiences using large- field liver RT have had limit ed 
success, because tolerable doses of whole- liver RT (approximately 30 Gy) are insufficient to  
control most lesions [5 -7]. Higher doses of whole- liver RT are associated with a significant risk  
of radiation-induced liver damage. Recent data have demonstrat ed that high- dose partial liver RT  
and SBRT may be safer and more effective than whole- liver RT for patients with liver tumors [8 - 
12].

Version Date:  01/16/[ADDRESS_1275313] on the tumor vasculature not found in the conventional 
form of radiation therapy [13]. McCammon et al [14] demonstrated a dose -effect for liver 
tumors. They showed increased dose and smaller gross tumor volume were significant predictors of higher local  control. Lesions treated to a nominal dose of 54 Gy or greater had a 3- year 
actuarial local control rate of 89.3% compared with 59.0% and 8.1% for those treated to 36–53.[ADDRESS_1275314] criteria  [15] . However, this 
is problematic because tumor volume change does not necessarily describe change in tumor 
physiology. In addition, large necrotic regions of tissue may be included in the morphological  
quantification  [16].  
 
Quantification of tumor perfusion has been accomplished in several modalities including MRI and 
CT [17,18] . Recent advances in scanner and image quality has made CT a viable modality for the 
quantification of perfusion in Oncology. Some of the advantages of measuring perfusion with CT instead of MRI include, but are not limited to: increased spatial resolution, decreased scan time, 
and study and scanner cost.   
  
Perfusion is the transport of blood to a unit volume of tissue per unit of time and usually refers to 
the blood transport at the capi[INVESTIGATOR_289875]. CT perfusion is based on the increase and subsequent 
decrease of contrast agent concentrations in tissues as a function of time. The typi[INVESTIGATOR_2855] C T perfusion 
protocol consists of a pre -contrast image acquisition followed by [CONTACT_908369]. This allows 
the temporal changes in CT attenuation in the tissue volume of interest to be measured. Modern 
CT scanners (>16slices) allow scanning of large volumes of liver tumors, including the portal vein. 
The tissue enhancement measured after contrast material injection can be divided into two 
temporal phases. In the first phase, the enhancement is mainly due to the contrast material within 
the intravascular space, and thus the enhancement is determined by [CONTACT_908370]. In the second 
phase, tissue enhancement results as contrast material passes from the intravascular  to the 
extravascular -extracellular space, and thus the enhancement depends on the blood volume and the 
permeability of capi[INVESTIGATOR_908357].

Protocol #:   18-2874 
Version Date:  01/16/[ADDRESS_1275315] for motion during the scan, and manual selection of arterial (and/or portal) 
input functions and ROI definition allows model -based voxel  wise computation of perfusion 
parameters. The effective time -intensity curve obtained from liver tissue is a result of an overlay 
of both the arterial and the portal venous components of perfusion. The normal liver is predominantly supplied by [CONTACT_64247] -pressure portal vein (75%) and supplemented by [CONTACT_5019]- pressure 
hepatic artery (25%), but HCC or m etastatic liver tumors can lead to global or regional perfusion 
changes. For example, patients with HCC may display increased hepatic arterial flow from the 
appearance of unpaired arteries. In the case of hepatic metastasis, proliferation of endothelial ce lls 
may result in increased hepatic arterial flow.  
 
CT Perfusion Parameters 
 
To obtain CT perfusion parameters, several kinetic model- based approaches have been developed. 
Single- compartment models allow for estimates of blood flow, blood volume, and MTT. Blood 
flow refers to the volume flow rate of blood through the vasculature (mL/min/100 mL). Blood 
volume is the volume of blood within the vasculature that is actually flowing (mL/100 mL). MTT 
is average time it takes for blood to traverse between the arterial inflow and the venous outflow, 
measured in seconds. Dual -compartment models are necessary to extract parameters that describe 
the interstitial space. Permeability surface area product is the product of permeability and the total surface area of capi[INVESTIGATOR_908358] a unit mass of tissue or tumor (measured as mL/min/100 
mL). Flow extraction product is the product of blood flow and the extraction fraction, which is the fraction of contrast agent arriving at the tissue that leaks into the extravascula r space in a single 
passage through the vasculature (measured as mL/min/100 mL).  
 CT perfusion parameters can thus be related to the pathologic features of tumor angiogenesis, 
although the relationship is complex. Blood volume and blood flow are known to c orrelate with 
microvessel density within the tumor. Blood volume reflects the density of tumor microvessels, and is not affected by [CONTACT_307041]. Permeability -related values such as permeability surface area 
product and flow extraction product are surrogates for vascular leakiness directly related to poorly formed vascular basement membrane. Decreased MTT usually reflects the presence of 
arteriovenous shunts, which are frequently demonstrated in the tumor.  
 The utility of perfusion falls under two categories: prediction of toxicity following radiation 
therapy, and outcome assessment as measured by [CONTACT_908371]. 
Perfusion will characterized for a number of different parameters from a pharmacokinetic model. 
Multiple pharmaco kinetic models can describe perfusion. For completeness, we will examine 
several models including: tissue homogeneity, Tofts, extended Tofts, and Patlak. Model goodness of fit will be assessed with root mean square error. The following perfusion parameters , derived

Version Date:  01/16/[ADDRESS_1275316] session: 
blood flow, blood volume of vascular space, blood volume of extracellular space, and intra -
compartment plasma flow. For each model, these perfusion parameters will have the mean, 
extremums, and standard deviation of each parameter value calculated.  
 The utilization of DCE -CT for outcome assessment in RT has been previously studied in several 
cancer sites, including the liver.  However, no study, to the best of our knowledge, has attempted to use DCE -CT as an outcome assessment tool for SBRT treatment of liver cancer. This study aims 
to gather preliminary data to assess the feasibility of using change in perfusion measurements following SBRT of liver cancer for outcome assessment. In this study, outcome assessment will 
be done using therapeutic radiation dose delivered as a surrogate measurement for treatment response. With the assumption that there is a positive relationship between treatment response and 
therapeutic radiation dose delivered, s hould this prove feasible, data captured in this study will be 
used to power a larger study aimed at developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a model that uses perfusion measurements for outcome assessment and prediction of prognosis following SBRT treatment.  
 
2.[ADDRESS_1275317] Enhanced Computed Tomography (DCE -CT) imaging for outcome assessment of radiation therapy (RT) for 
the treatment of liver HCC and metastases. DCE -CT, also known as perfusion CT, is a functional 
imaging modality that uses repeated computed tomography imaging after injection of an iodine -
based contrast agent. DCE -CT allows for a quantitative assessment of blood flow in malignant 
solid tumors and healthy surrounding tissue. This data provides for patient -specific information 
about the blood- flow characteristics of the tumor, as well as surrounding healthy tissue. The goal 
of this study is to use each patient’s tumor perfusion information  for outcome assessment of 
radiation therapy for the treatment of liver HCC and metastases.  
 In this study, we propose to focus on Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) as the radiation 
therapy treatment modality. SBRT delivers radiation therapy over a short time interval (3 -8 
sessions). This differs from conventional external beam radiation therapy, where a typi[INVESTIGATOR_908356] [ADDRESS_1275318] criteria  [16] . However, this tumor volume change does not necessarily describe change

 been previously studied in several cancer sites, including the liver  [1,3- 5]. However, no study, to 
the best of our knowledge, has attempted to use DCE -CT as an outcome assessment tool for SBRT 
treatment of liver cancer. This study aims to determine if perfusion changes from SBRT of liver 
cancer may be used for outcome assessment and prediction of prognosis.  
 Quantification of tumor perfusion has been accomplished in several modalities including MRI and 
CT [6,7]. Recent advances in scanner and image quality has made CT a viable modality for the 
quantification of perfusion in Oncology. Some of the advantages of measuring perfusion with CT instead of MRI include, but are not limited to: increased sp atial resolution, decreased scan time, 
and study and scanner cost.    
Summary:  
Previous studies in other cancer sites have shown DCE -CT is suitable for use in human subjects. 
In addition, these studies have shown DCE -CT provides useful information for outcome 
assessment of radiation therapy. No work has studied DCE -CT for outcome assessment of SBRT  
treatment of liver malignancies. The preliminary results of our work shows that the DCE -CT 
imaging protocol has been optimized, and is suitable for patient use.

(2.8%), burning sensation (1.4%), nausea (1.2 %), hot flashes (1.5%), and warmth (1.1%). Less 
well defined but perhaps more important i s the risk of contrast -induced nephropathy, which has 
incidence of 2% in general population but can have high (~30%) incidence in patients with chronic renal impairment.  
 Patients who participate in this study will also receive slightly higher doses of ionizing radia tion 
than those who do not, due to the extra imaging scans; on the order of 5 mGy to tissues of the abdomen. Patients will go on to receive SBRT for liver malignancies, which forms the primary 
component of the normal ionizing radiation dose in this populat ion. This treatment delivers an 
average of roughly 10 Gy to normal tissue; the additional imaging represents a 0.05% increase in overall ionizing radiation dose from radiotherapy related procedures. We expect the additional 
DCE -CT scans will result in no a dditional adverse events (AEs).

3 OBJECTIVES AND PURPOSE  
Primary O bjective:  Investigate the asso ciation between the delivered radiation therapy dose 
distribution and the change in perfusion measurement following treatment.  
The goal of this study is to determine if perfusion, as measured from DCE -CT, can be imaged in 
the liver to assess treatment response from radiation therapy. Total therapeutic radiation dose delivered during SBRT will be used as a surrogate measurement for treatment response. This may 
provide unique physiological information that will improve outcome assessment, as well as predict 
treatment efficacy, for patients treated with SBRT for liver cancer.  
 Specifically, this study investigates if perfusion characteristics, as well as their respective changes 
from pre -treatment to post- treatment DCE -CT imaging, may have a relationship with therapeutic 
radiation dose. This will potentially provide a strong measure of treatment prognosis that will

changes after liver SBRT treatment are reproducible and relative to normal liver function.  
 
Secondary O bjective:  Explore any demographic differences in perfusion metrics.  
 The secondary objective will be used to provide descriptive information on demographic 
differences in perfusion metrics. Should a larger study be warranted this information will be crucial 
in study design and analysis to control for demographic differences.  
 
[ADDRESS_1275322] -treatment perfusion assessment will be six weeks after the end of SBRT (with an 
allowed time window of 4- 8 weeks) . 
 
Step 1 (Enrollment & Screening):  
 
Patients with liver cancer receiving stereotactic body radiation (SBRT) as part of their standard of 
care will be eligible for study enrollment. SBRT is similar to conventional, photon- based radiation 
therapy. SBRT differs from conventional radiation therapy by [CONTACT_908372], also call ‘a fraction’, and a higher radiation dose per treatment  session. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], SBRT is [ADDRESS_1275323] imaging will be added at three specific time points of the 
clinical workflow for the quan tification of perfusion.  
 
Step 2 (Pre -treatment perfusion assessment):  
 
Subjects will have DCE -CT imaging before the initiation of radiation therapy. Under SOC, all 
patients receiving radiation therapy undergo a planning CT simulation session. This session of CT imaging produces the CT study that will be used to create the radiation treatment plan. Under this 
PI:   [INVESTIGATOR_908353] n 
Protocol #:   18-2874 
Version Date:  01/16/[ADDRESS_1275324] scan will be acquired to quantify a patient’s baseline perfusion 
characteristics.  
 
Step 3 (Initiation of Radiation Thera py and Post- treatment perfusion assessment):  
 
Subjects will begin radiation therapy for treatment of liver cancer or metastases. Each individual 
treatment session, also known as a “fraction”, will utilize on -board imaging to ensure localization 
of treatment to the patient’s unique anatomy for each session. This is the SOC with no modifications to the radiation treatment characteristics. Subjects will have DCE -CT imaging 
within six hours of receiving the first fraction of radiation therapy to assess the SBRT  related 
changed to baseline perfusion characteristics.  
 
Step 4 (Completion of Radiation Therapy): 
 
Subjects will complete radiation therapy in 1 to 2 weeks, depending on prescribed radiation dose. 
This is the SOC with no modifications to the radiation treatment characteristics.  
 
Step 5 (Six -week follow-up/Post- treatment perfusion assessment):  
 
Subjects will have a follow -up visit with the radiation oncologist approximately [ADDRESS_1275325] treatment, and 6 weeks after treatment. Profusion metrics 
include: KTrans (aka extraction -flow product), blood volume, and blood flow.  
 
 
4.2.2  SECONDARY  ENDPOINT  
 
Patient demographic data will be combined with the primary endpoints to assess whether perfusion 
metrics differ depending on baseline demographics.

second and axial images centered at the tumor will be acquired.  
 
7 STUDY PROCEDURES AND SCHEDULE  
7.1 STUDY PROCEDURES/EVALUATIONS 
1. Subject enrollment and initial visit with radiation oncologist  
 
The subject will have a pre -treatment, standard of care work -up visit with the radiation oncologist. 
During this visit, the study team  will explain the study to the patient and obtain informed consent. 
After consent has been obtained, the study team will a ssess if the subject meets study criteria and 
can be enrolled into the study.  
 
2. Pre-treatment DCE -CT Imaging 
 
During the initial CT simulation process, the pre -treatment perfusion imaging will be obtained 
using DCE -CT. The initial CT simulation process is used to create the radiation therapy treatment 
plan and is a part of SOC. At the end of the CT simulation session, additional DCE -CT imaging 
will be acquired.  
 
3. Delivery of Radiation Therapy 
 Treatment will be performed on a linear accelerator with on -board imaging capabilities to align 
the subject to the same treatment position for every treatment session. Throughout treatment, the 
subject will have a weekly evaluation with the radiation oncologist to help manage any health 
problems that may arise.  
 
Subjects will have DCE -CT imaging within six hours of receiving the first fraction of radiation 
therapy to assess the SBRT related changed to baseline perfusion characteristics.  
     
4. Six week follow -up visit/Post- treatment DCE -CT Imaging  
 The subject will  have a SOC six week follow -up visit with the radiation oncologist. During the 
consult, the radiation oncologist will assess any issues arising from radiation treatment. At this

There are no restrictions on concomitant medications, treatments (i.e. chemotherapy, hormonal, 
immunotherapy) and procedures while on study. 
 
8 ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY  
8.1 SPECIFICATION OF SAFETY PARAMETERS 
 
8.1.1  DEFINITION OF ADVERSE EVENTS (AE)  
Adverse event  means any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of an intervention 
in humans. 
Because this is an imaging study, where no clinical decision will be al tered, we will only record 
AEs that have to do with the research procedures. The three resea rch procedures are the pre-
treatment, post- first fraction , and post- treatment DCE -CT imaging. 
 
8.1.2  DEFINITION OF SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS (SAE)  
Serious adverse event or serious suspected adverse reaction . An AE or suspected adverse 
reaction is considered “serious” if, in the view of either the investigator or sponsor, it results in 
PI:   [INVESTIGATOR_908353] n 
Protocol #:   18-2874 
Version Date:  01/16/2020 
 22 of 34 
 any of the following outcomes: death, a life -threatening adverse event, inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_106156], a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial 
disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, or a congenital anomaly/ birth defect. 
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6721], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of suc h medical events include allergic bronchospasm 
requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug 
abuse.  
 
Because th is is an imaging study, where no clinical decision will be altered, we will only record 
SAEs that have to do with the research procedures. The three research procedures are the pre-
treatment, post-first fraction and post- treatment DCE -CT imaging. 
 
8.1.3  DEFINITION OF UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS (UAP)  
 
This study will use the COMIRB definition of UAP. An unanticipated problem is any event or 
information that was unforeseen and indicates that the research procedures caused harm (including 
physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) to participants or others or indicates that 
participants or others are at increased risk of harm than was previously known or recognized.  
   
8.2 CLASSIFICATION OF AN ADVERSE EVENT  
 
8.2.1  SEVERITY OF EVENT  
For AEs not included in the protocol -defined grading system, the following guidelines will be used 
to describe severity.  
• Mild  – Events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the 
participant’s daily activities.  
• Moderate – Events result in a low level  of inconvenience or concern with the 
therapeutic measures. Moderate events may cause some interference with functioning.  
• Severe – Events interrupt a participant’s usual daily activity and may require systemic 
drug therapy or other treatment. Severe events  are usually potentially life -threatening 
or incapacitating.

Protocol #:   18-2874 
Version Date:  01/16/[ADDRESS_1275334] imaging. 
 
8.2.3  EXPECTED ADVERSE EVENTS  
The Investigator will be responsible for determining whether an SAE is expected or unexpected. 
An SAE will be considered unexpected if the nature, severity, or frequency of the event is not 
consistent with the risk information previously described for the study agent.  
 
8.3 TIME PERIOD AND FREQUENCY FOR EVENT ASSESSMENT AND FOLLOW- UP 
The occurrence of an AE or SAE may come to the attention of study personnel during study visits 
and interviews of a study participant presenting for medical care, or upon review by a study 
monitor. All AEs including local and systemic reactions not meeting the criteria for SAEs will be 
captured on the appropriate CRF. Information to be collected includes event description, time of onset, clinician’s assessment of severity, relationship to study product (assessed only by [CONTACT_214527] a diagnosis), and time of resolution/ stabilization of the event. 
All AEs occurring while on study must be documented appropriately. All AEs will be followed to 
adequate resolution.  
 The PI [INVESTIGATOR_908360]. At each study visit, the investigator will inquire about the 
occurrence of AE/ SAEs since the last visit. Events will be followed for outcome information until resolution or stabilization.  
 
8.4 REPORTING PROCEDURES 
8.4.1  ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING  
 
Reporting of UAPs, SAEs, and reportable AEs will be performed pursuant to the UCCC DSM C 
and IRB institutional policy.  
 
8.4.2  SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING  
 All SAEs will be followed until satisfactory resolution or until the PI [INVESTIGATOR_908361].

are following the CMP.  
 
10 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
10.1 STATISTICAL AND ANALYTICAL PLANS 
The utility of perfusion falls under two categories: predictive performance from DCE -CT imaging 
changes, and outcome assessment of radiation therapy treatment. Perfusion will characterized for a number of different parameters from a pharmacokinetic model. Multiple pharmacokinetic 
models can describe perfusion. For completeness, we will examine several models in cluding: 
tissue homogeneity, Tofts, extended Tofts, and Patlak. Model goodness of fit will be assessed with root mean square error. The following perfusion parameters, derived from previously mentioned 
PI:   [INVESTIGATOR_908353] n 
Protocol #:   18-2874 
Version Date:  01/16/[ADDRESS_1275338] session: blood flow, blood volume 
of vascular space, blood volume of extracellular space, and intra -compartment plasma flow. For 
each model, these perfusion parameters will have the mean, extremums, and standard deviation of 
each parameter value calculated.  
 Treatment response will be assessed using the DCE -CT imaging changes from the baseline to the 
6-week follow -up. Changes in perfusion parameters will be compared to the delivered dose  with 
correlation coefficients, logistic regression analysis, and receiver operating characteristic analysis.    
 
10.2 STATISTICAL HYPOTHESES 
• Primary Efficacy Endpoint(s): 
No formal hypothesis testing will be conducted for the primary analysis  
 
10.[ADDRESS_1275339] profusion metrics, change in 
profusion metrics following therapy will be assessed both after a patient’s first treatment and at 6-
weeks following their end of the SB RT treatment.
 Descriptive statistics will be provided for all 
measured variables.  
 
10.4.2   ANALYSIS OF THE PRIMARY EFFICACY ENDPOINT(S)  
The primary endpoint of this study is change in profusion metrics from baseline to end of first radiation treatment and 6 -weeks after treatment has ended. Additionally, total radiation dose 
delivered from SBRT will be captured and used as a surrogate measu rement for treatment  
response.  
PI:   [INVESTIGATOR_908353] n 
Protocol #:   18-2874 
Version Date:  01/16/[ADDRESS_1275340] scans. Correlation between change in 
profusion and total radiation dose received will be evaluated using Spearman’s correlation 
coefficient.  
 
10.4.3   ANALYSIS OF THE SECONDARY ENDPOINT(S)  
To assess descriptively whether there are signs that profusion metrics differ based on patient 
demographics the following demographic information will be captured; age , sex, race, clinical stage at diagnosis. Change in profusion metrics from baseline to each of the two follow -up DCE -
CT scans will be stratified by [CONTACT_908379], 
e.g., sample size, mean, median, standard deviation, and range. 
 
10.4.4   SAFETY ANALYSES  
Should an AE related to the study intervention (i.e., additional DCE -CT sc ans) occur, the study 
will be terminated. Definition and monitoring of AEs are detailed in section 8.  
10.4.5   ADHERENCE AND RETENTION ANALYSES 
There are no pre- planned adherence and retention analyses.  
 
10.4.6  BASELINE DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS 
Baseline descriptive statistics for patient demographics will be collected and reported.  
 
10.4.7   PLANNED INTERIM ANALYSES  
There are no planned interim analyses.  
  
10.5 SAMPLE SIZE  
The study will enroll a minimum of 10 patients with a maximum enrollment of 15 patients to allow for screen failures and dropouts . This sample size was based the number of patients that would be 
reasonable for t he Department of Radiation Oncology to recruit within a year. T he Department of 
Radiation Oncology treats approximately 50 liver cancer patients with SBRT per year. Assuming 
an enrollment rate of 40% and a dropout rate of 25%, a conse rvative estimate is enrolling a 
maximum of 15  patients in 12 months.

individual’s liver cancer responds to standard radiation treatment.
Procedures: If you agree to participate, the following will happen: 
You will have a screening visit to make sure you are eligible to be in the study. 
If you are eligible, you will have a DCE-CT Scan of your liver before, during, and 
after standard radiation treatment (total of 3 scans).
You
 will be in the study for approximately 3 months. 
Risks: Participation in
 research involves risks, including the following:  
The risk of CT scans includes exposure to radiation. A special dye (contrast 
material) will be given
 to you before the scan. Although rare, the contrast material 
may cause an allergic reaction. The contrast material may cause kidney damage.

How long will I be on the study?
The total length of the time you will participating in this study is about 3 months. 
What are the possible discomforts or risks?
Discomforts you may experience while in this study include the same discomforts and risk 
which may be encountered during standard radiation treatment for liver cancer. These side 
effects are listed below and your physician will discuss the chances of these toxicities and 
their treatments in the specific context of your cancer and radiation plan.  
In addition to the below risks, this study may include risks that are unknown at this time.
Risk of Dynamic Contrast Enhanced Computed Tomography (DCE-CT) 
Imaging 
There is a risk of slightly 
higher doses of radiation because of  the extra imaging 
scans. The additional exposure from this type of imaging is about 0.05% increase 
from the radiation you would otherwise be receiving from your radiation therapy.
In addition to the small increase of radiation, Dynamic Contrast Enhanced 
Computed Tomography 
(DCE-CT) scans have the following risks:

Study Design:  
The study is an open label trial of continuous infusion terlipressin.  
The study will enroll 6 patients with cirrhosis and refractory ascites. Two sentinel patients 
with serum creatinine <1.5 mg/dL will be enrolled first in a safety lead -in Phase. Thereafter 4 
additional patients will be enrolled, with no less than 2 patients  with serum creatinine ≥ 1.5 
and < 2.0 mg/dL  
After being enrolled in the trial patients will be monitored for up to 28 days until they 
require a therapeutic paracentesis. Starting within 3 days of the paracentesis, patients will be 
treated with a continuou s infusion of terlipressin over 7 days in- house and, if tolerated, 
continue treatment in the ambulatory setting for another 21 days. The initial Terlipressin 
infusion dose will be 2 mg/day, which may be escalated to [ADDRESS_587217] 
of trea tment on morning MAP and observed safety and therapeutic response. Upon 
completion of treatment, patients will be monitored for safety for 28 days in the ambulatory 
setting. The study design is outlined below:

transplantation is recommended (Runyon, 2013). Since these patien ts are not hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057] , 
outpatient therapi[INVESTIGATOR_459755], in addition to improving quality of life. Such a therapy can act 
as a bridge to liver transplantation  in those eligible for transplant and as palliative care in those 
ineligible for transplant.  
A reduction of the splanchnic vasodilation associated with portal hypertension and sodium and 
water retention can lead to a decrease in ascites formation by [CONTACT_459783] a decrease in activation of the renin- angiotensin system with resulting 
increase in renal sodium excretion (Kalambokis, 2005). Terlipressin (triglycyl lysine 
vasopressin; a long- acting synthetic analogue of vasopressin), binds to vasopressin [ADDRESS_587219] hemodynamic dysfunction and manage ascites in cirrhotic patients.  
Terlipressin has been shown to: 1) reduce port al hypertension in cirrhotic patients (Ding, 2013, 
Escorsell, 1997, Narahara, 2009, Baik, 2005); 2) improve renal function and induce natriuresis 
in cirrhotic patients with ascites without hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) (Krag, 2007); 3) increase 
GFR, urine vol ume and urine sodium while decreasing renin and aldosterone levels in HRS 
patients in combination with albumin (Ortega, 2002); 4) decrease the need for large volume 
paracentesis, increasing urinary sodium excretion when used in combi nation with albumin and 
diuretics in refractory ascites patients with normal renal function (Fimiani, 2011) and 5) reduce 
the volume of ascites and number of paracentesis procedures in refractory ascites patients 
treated for 28 days with terlipressin admin istered as a continuous  infusion on an outpatient 
basis (Gow,  2016). 
Currently, terlipressin is approved in Europe for the treatment of bleeding esophageal varices 
and HRS type 1. In two US clinical trials in patients with type 1 HRS terlipressin was 
admin istered as an IV bolus starting at 1 mg every 6 h and increased to 2 mg every 6 h 
(maximum 8 mg/day depending on response).

Recent studies support the increased safety and efficacy of low -dose terlipressin delivered by 
[CONTACT_3365]. W hile bolus dosing of terlipressin (1 or 2 mg) leads to a significant 
reduction of HVPG for 3 -4 h, continuous infusion of terlipressin (4 mg/day) for 24 h results in 
a sustained reduction in portal venous pressure with no side effects (Ding, 2013). Continuous 
infusion allows for a significant  reduction in the daily effective dose required for HRS reversal 
(2.23 mg/day versus 3.51 mg/day, p < 0.0001) with a concomitant reduction in AEs (35.29% 
continuous infusion vs 62.16% bolus regimen, p < 0.025) and SAEs ( 20.59% continuous 
infusion vs 44.4% bolus regimen, p < 0.05) (Cavallin, 2016). It thus appears that the improved 
safety of terlipressin delivered as a low -dose continuous infusion could enable its use in the 
outpatient setting in the prolonged treatment of  patients with refractory ascites. In a pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], 
continuous outpatient infusion of terlipressin has been used successfully on an outpatient basis 
to reduce ascites and decrease the number of paracentesis procedures in 5/5 cirrhotic patients 
with refrac tory ascites (Gow, 2016). 
There is l imited PK data for terlipressin in humans despi[INVESTIGATOR_459756] 
1980s. Following IV bolus administration terlipressin plasma concentrations decline in a bi - 
exponential fashion. Terlipressin, which itse lf has vasopressive activity (Ryckwaert, 2009; 
Colson, 2016), reaches C max of > 50 ng/ml after a single IV dose of 0.7 mg after approximately 
5 minutes (Nilsson, 1990). Terlipressin is metabolized via enzymatic cleavage of its three 
glycine residues by [CONTACT_459784] 8 -lysine -vasopressin (8 -LVP), its more 
biologically active component, with measurable levels of 8- LVP appearing approximately 30 
minutes after bolus administration, peaking at between 1 and 2 h (Forsling, 1980, Nilsson, 
1990). In 29 HRS patients, a dose of terlipressin of 1 mg every 6 h resulted in a mean C max of 
terlipressin and 8 -LVP of 62 ng/mL and 0.75 ng/mL, respectively (Lucassin AusPAR 130827-  
cer). 
The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics activity support the current bolus dosing 
regimen of every 4- 6 h though significant reduction of portal hypertension lasts only half of a 6 
hour dosing interval with a bolus dose of 1 mg (Escorsell, 1997) and effects on hemodynamic 
parameters, including portal hypertension, are intermittent with this regimen (Ding, 2013). To 
date PK data is not available for continuous infusion of low -dose terlipressin but this regimen 
would presumably result in sustained therapeutic levels of both peptides. PK projections for

plasma concentra tions at steady state (C ss) of both terlipressin and 8- LVP during continuous 
infusion of a dose of 2 mg/day/subject estimate steady state levels to be 2 -3 ng/ml and 0.1 to 
0.3 ng/ml, respectively. The projected C ss of terlipressin is far less than the C max obtained with 
bolus dosing (2- 3 ng/ml vs 62 ng/m l) and might result in a reduction of the rate and severity of 
AEs related to the immediate severe hemodynamic effects of terlipressin as a bolus dose.  
In our planned pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], low -dose continuous infusion of terlipressin will be administered via 
ambula tory pump to a cohort of cirrhotic patients with refractory ascites, initially for 7 days in 
a GCRC to establish safety and tolerability followed by [CONTACT_459785] a 
further 21 days of treatment. Initially, 2 sentinel patients with SCr < 1.5 mg/dL will be enrolled 
followed by 4 additional patients with SCr < 2.0 mg/dL. An extensive PK analysis will be 
performed. The C ss of both te rlipressin and [ADDRESS_587220] on the quality of life

• To assess renal function based on the change in serum creatinine, glomerular filtration 
rate and sodium excretion wi th continuous infusion of  terlipressin  
• To assess the plasma renin activity (PRA) and plasma aldosterone concentration with 
continuous infus ion of  terlipressin  
 
5. MATERIALS AND  METHODS  
 
5.1. STUDY DESIGN  
The study is an open label single arm uncontrolled trial of continuous infusion terlipressin. The 
study will be completed in two sequential steps:  
• Two sentinel patients with cirrhosis and refractory ascites with serum creatinine < 1.5 
mg/dL will be enrolled and complete the 28 day infusion period. 
• Then, 4 additiona l patients with cirrhosis and refractory ascites with serum  creatinine  
 
< 2.0 mg/dL). N o less than [ADDRESS_587221] a serum creatinine ≥ 1.5 and < 2.0 
mg/dL. 
After being consented and enrolled in the trial patients will be monitored without intervention 
for up to 28 days until they require a therapeutic paracentesis. Starting within 3 days after the 
paracentesis, patients will be admitted to the GCRC and be treated with a continuous infusion 
of terlipressin over 7 days in -house with step- wise dose escalation, and, if tolerated, continue 
treatment in the ambulatory setting for an additio nal 21 days. The initial terlipressin infusion 
dose will be 2 mg/day, which may be escalated to [ADDRESS_587222] -trial for an add itional 3 
months to monitor morbidity (transplant free survival, requirement for dialysis and need for 
therapeutic paracentesis).  
 
5.2. STUDY SITES  
Patients will be enrolled at up to 3 sites in the US.  
 
5.3. STUDY POPULATION 
 
5.3.1.  Patient Screening and  Enrollment  
Informed consent wil l be obtained from each potential patient prior to screening for eligibility. 
A sufficient number of patients will be enrolled to ensure that a total of 6 patients complete the 
planned treatment periods. 
 
5.3.2.  Criteria for Inclusion  
• Patients with  cirrhosis.

The following assessments will be performed:  
 
• Significant medical history over the past 5 years and current medical  conditions  
 
• Cirrhosis disease history  
 
• Collate Child -Pugh and encephalopathy score  
 
• Physical exam, with vitals (MAP/BP, HR), body height/weight, temperature, abdominal 
circumference 
• Electrocardiogram  
 
• Collect blood samples for clinical laboratory assessments including: Hematology (CBC 
with differential), Metabolic Panel (creatinine, BUN, electrolytes [sodium, potassium, 
CO2, chloride], glucose, calcium), Liver function test (ALT/AST, alkaline phosphatas e, 
total protein, albumin, total and direct bilirubin, PT/INR), PRA and plasma  aldosterone.

RBC/blood, WBC, protein. 
• List concomitant  medications  
 
• Administe r the Short Form  36 and CLDQ  QOL  
 
6.3.4.  Enrollment of  Patients  
Patients who meet inclusion/exclusion criteria will be assigned a study number and are also to 
be identified by [CONTACT_22705], middle and last initials. If the patient has no middle initial, a dash is to be 
used. For patien ts screened but found non- eligible the reason will be recorded in a screening 
log. 
 
6.3.5.  Pre-Treatment Observation  Period  
Patients will be monitored for up to [ADDRESS_587234] medical car e, including die tary restriction and stable therapy with diuretics (i.e. 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_8407], furosemide).

For cirrhot ic patients with refractory ascites  Page 31 of 91  
Protocol CIT -001  
November 17 , 2018   
  
A pre -paracentesis baseline serum creatinine, 24 hr Na+ urine excretion and MAP will be 
established by [CONTACT_459797] a week apart, o ne should be close to time of 
therapeutic paracentesis performed prior to terlipressin infusion.  
Admissi on to GCRC and start of Terlipressin infusion will be dependent on when a therapeutic 
paracentesis is warranted, as terlipressin treatment should start within 3 days of a paracentesis.  
If the patient does not require a paracentesis within this 28 days observation period then the 
patient will be terminated from the trial and will be replaced. The volume of ascites drained at 
paracentesis will be recorded. The ascites fluid will be tested for evidence of spontaneous 
bacterial peritonitis (SBP) (PMN count, culture). A patient found to have SBP will be 
withdrawn from the trial and not receive terlipressin infusion. Such patients will be replaced.  
At the time o f the paracentesis, female patien ts will have a serum pregnancy test to confirm they 
are not pregnant. The patient will be admitted to the GCRC so that terlipressin infusion may be 
initiated within 1 and 3 days of completion of the paracentesis.  
 
6.4. TREATMENT  PERIOD  
 
6.4.1.  Baseline - Admission  
Patient will be admitted to the GCRC the day prior to planned initiation of terlipressin infusion. 
A peripherally inserted central catheter (PI[INVESTIGATOR_6875]) or a midline catheter per site usual practice will 
be positioned for administra tion of terlipressin . 
The following tests will be completed prior to start of terlipressin infusion: 
 
• Sign and symptoms directed physical exam, with vitals, body weight, temperature, 
abdominal  circumference 
• Electrocardiogram  
 
• Collect blood samples for clin ical laboratory asse ssments including: Hematology (CBC 
with differential), Metabolic Panel (creatinine, BUN, electrolytes [sodium, potassium, 
CO2, chloride], glucose, calcium), Liver function test (ALT/AST, alkaline phosphatase, 
total protein, albumin, tot al and direct biliru bin, PT/INR).

November 17 , 2018   
  
• Collect urine sample for urinalysis including: pH, glucose, bilirubin/urobilirubin, 
RBC/blood, WBC, protein. 
• 24 hour urinary sodium  excretion  
 
• List concomitant  medications  
 
• Administer the Short Form 36 and CLDQ  QOL  
 
• Evaluate AE of interest  pre-treatment  
 
The patient should be hemodynamically stable prior to starting the terlipressin infusion. BP/HR 
and MAP should be determined at least twice and terlipressin infusion may be delayed within 
the 72- hour window according to t he inclusion criteria if the patient is found hemodynamically 
unstable.  
 
6.4.2.  In-House Treatment of  Patients  
Terlipressin will be administered by [CONTACT_119654]. Start of infusion should be 
within [ADDRESS_587235] therapeutic paracentesis that occurs during the Pre-  
Treatment Period.  
Initial terlipressin dosing will be 2 mg/da y administered via an ambulatory infusion pump. 
Refer to S ection 5.6 for detailed pharmacy and preparation instructions. The following 
assessments will be obtained prior to starting terlipressin infusion in the morning:  
• Estim ated MAP (computed as 2/3[diastolic] + 1/3[systolic] taken from the earliest 
morning BP measurement repeated once 10 minutes apart in a sitting position -  Refer to 
Section  15. 
• Spot urinary creatinine and  sodium  
 
• Vitals, including MAP/BP and HR will be monitored for safety during the infusion of 
terlipressin and after each dose adjustments (See below) at 0.5, 1, 2, [ADDRESS_587236] dose escalation may occur no earlier than Day 3 (Bag #3) to 3 mg/day terlipres sin; A 
dose escalation will occur unless the following is observed:

For cirrhot ic patients with refractory ascites  Page 33 of 91  
Protocol CIT -001  
November 17 , 2018   
  
• Estimated MAP (computed as 2/3[diastolic] + 1/3[systolic] taken from the earliest 
morning BP me asurement is increased compared from pre- dose escalation or pre-  
treatment values by [CONTACT_726] 5 mmHg. Note: Estimated MAP will be obtained from 
the average of 2 BP measurements taken 10 minutes apart in a sitting position -  Refer  to 
Section  15. 
• Based on investigator judgment a dose increase is not adv isable (including for example: 
Treatment emergent elevation of systolic BP over 120 mmHg, clinically significant signs 
or symptoms of vasoconstriction, headache, and arrhythmia or other treatment emergent 
ECG anomalies, treatment emergent gastrointestinal symptom, treatment emergent 
hyponatremia / hypokalemia or fluid imbalance, other clinically significant AE deemed 
probably related to treatment by [CONTACT_093]). The reason(s ) for not escalating the 
infusion rate will be documented on the  CRFs.  
A secon d dose escalation may occur to 4 mg no earlier than Day 5 (Bag #5) if based on 
Investigator judgement a dose increase is advisable:  
• Treatment has been well tolerated and no concerning treatment emergent anomalies have 
occurred, such as: Sustained of morning MAP by [CONTACT_726] 5mmHg from pre -treatment 
values, treatment emergent elevation of systolic BP over 120 mmHg, clinically 
significant signs or symptoms of vasoconstriction, heada che, and arrhythmia or other 
treatment emergent ECG anomalies, treatment emerg ent gastrointestinal symptom, 
treatment emergent hyponatremia / hypokalemia or fluid imbalance, signs of 
dehydration, signs of reduced renal function, and other clinically signif icant AE deemed 
probably related to treatment in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_459762]). 
• There has been no sign of a pharmacodynamic response to terlipressin therapy, such as 
no clinically significant increased sodium excretion, no reduction in weight or abdomen 
circumference, volume of paracentesis or ascites accumulation appears unchang ed from 
baseline.  
Should the dose escalation to 4 mg be decided by [CONTACT_459798] (Refer to Section 6.4.4) then the  patient will be monitored in -house for safety for no less

CO2, chloride], glucose, calcium), Liver function test (ALT/AST, al kaline phosphatase, 
total protein, albumin, total and direct bilirubin, PT/INR)  
• Spot urinary creatinine and  sodium  
 
6.4.4.  Discharge from  GCRC 
The patient will be discharge from the unit on Day 7 (after Bag #7 has been started). However, 
when the 3 mg dose of ter lipressin in fusion has been maintained for no less than 24 hours the 
patient may at the Investigator discretion, be discharged home for the night and return for day 
monitoring at the GCRC in the morning. 
The following assessments will be performed on Day 7 :

6.5. RECOMMENDED CONCOMITANT  MEDICATION  
Diuretics will be maintained at the dose established in the pre -treatment period unless patient 
develops an adverse event, regardless of relationship attribution, that requires diuretic 
discontinuation (hypotension, acute kidney injury, GI hemorrhage). Pa tients will be maintained 
on the same dose of other medications (e.g. lactulose, rifaximin). 
If patients are on ACE inhibitors or beta blockers they will be required to be on a stable dose for 
at least [ADDRESS_587241] -paracentesis circulatory dysfunction (PPCD) and as clinically indicated. It is 
recommended (if clinically appro priate) that the albumin dose administered to prevent PPCD 
(usually 6- 8 g/L of ascites fluid removed) is kept constant for each LVP that might be required 
during the study period.  Albumin use will be recorded in the CRF as a concomitant medication.  
 
6.6. PROHI BITED CONCOMITANT  MEDICATIONS  
The following medications are prohibited or strongly discouraged during terlipressin  infusion.  
 
Prohibited Concomitant Medications  
Midodrine and other vasopressive drugs including vasopressin, 
dopamine, dobutamine,norepi[INVESTIGATOR_459763] (e.g.,  misoprostol)  
NSAIDs (e.g., ibuprofen, naproxen,  diclofenac)  
 
 
6.7. PHARMACOKINETICS OF  TERLIPRESSIN  
In order to characterize the pharmacokinetics and examine the influence of potential covariates, 
serial blood samples will be  obtained from subjects.  The pharmacokinetics of terlipressin and 
its metabolite, 8 -lysine vasopressin, will be assessed following  the start of the of the 2 mg/kg 
infusion on Day 1, at changes in infusion dose during the 7- day in- house stay, at interim vi sits 
while the infusion continues and prior to the discontinuation of the infusion due to an adverse 
effect. Blood samples will be collected in the arm contralateral to the terlipressin infusion, if 
possible, or below the terlipressin infusion site in the same arm . 
• Prior to the start of the terlipressin infusion on Day 1 and 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 6, and 
24h after the start of the c ontinuous  infusion. 
• Prior to the change in infusion rate and 1, 2 and 8 hours after the dose change to 3 mg (if 
such dose change  occurs).  
• Prior to the change in infusion rate and 1, 2 and 4 hour after the dose change to 4 mg (if 
such dose change  occurs)

November 17 , 2018   
  
• Morning on days 7, 14 and 28. 
 
• Prior to discontinuation of terlipressin for an adverse  effect  
 
Samples on Day [ADDRESS_587242] prompted blood draws will be performed by [CONTACT_459799]. Refer to 
Section 14 for instruction for sample processing.  
 
6.8. INFLUENCE  OF PARACENTESIS  ON TERLIPRESSIN  PHARMACOKINETI CS. 
The influence of removal of ascitic fluid on the pharmacokinetics of terlipressin and its 
metabolite, 8 -lysine vasopressin, will be assessed. If a LVP occurs during terlipressin infusion, 
then blood samples, 4- ml, will be collected in the arm contralateral to the terlipressin infusion (if 
possible or below the terlipressin infusion site in the same arm) immediately before the 
paracentesis, 30 minutes after completion of the paracentesis and if feasible 6 hours after 
completion of the paracentesis. The t otal volume of ascites fluid r emoved during paracentesis 
will be measured and a 10 -ml ascites fluid aliquot saved for assay.  
 
6.9. DIET 
Patient will remain on their regular diet with usual sodium restriction during the duration of the 
study per AASLD Practice Guideline 2012. Patients will be requested to complete a daily - 
sodium tracker form during the duration of the trial (American Heart  Association Sodium 
Tracker) to be reviewed at weekly interval by a nutritionist to monitor their adherence to their 
diet. 
 
6.10. PATIENT  EDUCATION  
Patient consented into the trial will receive dieticians’ guidance and information leaflets to assist 
in re-educating patient and relatives regarding salt restriction to a target of 90 mmol/day and 
helpi[INVESTIGATOR_459764] a no- added salt diet and avoidance  of pre -prepa red foodstuffs (for 
example, pi[INVESTIGATOR_014]).  
Patients will also be educated to spot any evidence of intestinal bleeding (blood in stool or black 
stool).

November 17 , 2018   
  
6.11. THERAPEUTIC PARACENTESIS DURING AND AFTER THE STUDY PERIOD  
Paracentesis should be do ne as indicated by [CONTACT_459800]:  
• Presence of moderate to severe ascites upon medical exam with patient discomfort 
(shortness of breath or umbilical hernia or abdominal pain and/or distension, and/or 
limitation  of activity) and patient’s request for a repeat  LVP  
• Weight gain to 90- 100% of LVP delta weight loss (reference weight taken prior to initial 
LVP). For example, if the patient loss is 10kg immediately after LVP the patient must 
regain 9 -10 kg (90%) of 10kg at the time of repeat  paracentesis 
• Increase in abdominal girth to 90 -100% of LVP delta abdominal girth (prior to initial 
LVP).  
Reason for deviations from the standardized triggers detailed above will be noted in the CRF.  
 
For each paracentesis performed in the course of the trial,  the date and volume collected will be 
recorded. Ascites fluid will be inoculated into blood culture b ottles at the bedside and examined 
by [CONTACT_459790] a neutrophil count to rule out spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). 
A 10mL sample will be collected, labelled (Patient Number, Date of collection) and stored 
frozen for later determination of albumin  and terlipressin ascites concentration if such 
determination is warranted.  
Adverse events following paracentesis including for example infection, post -paracentesis 
circulatory dysfunction (PPCD) and infection will be recorded, together with preventative 
measures such as administration of albumin.  
 
6.12. DATA COLLECTION AFTER THE STUDY  PERIOD  
To better estimate the durability of the terlipressin effect and explore the possibility of a rebound 
effect, the date/volume of paracenteses occurring within [ADDRESS_587243] the right to discontinue treatment and/or withdraw from the  study at any time 
without prejudice. The investigator may discontinue any subject at any time for any reason.

For cirrhot ic patients with refractory ascites  Page 41 of 91  
Protocol CIT -001  
November 17 , 2018   
  
If study treatment or protocol -specified assessments are discontinued, the reason will be 
recorded on the CRFs and the sponsor should be notified promptly. 
Reasons for terminating participation in the clinical study may include the following:  
 
• Patient did not require a LVP during the up to 28 day Pre -Treatment  Period. 
 
• Patient with evidence of SBP based on baseline ascites fluid  examination. 
 
• Any clinical adverse event (AE), laboratory abnormality, requirement for a  concomitant 
medication, concurrent illnes s, or other medical condition or situatio n occurs such that, 
in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], continued participation in the study would not be in 
the best interest of the  subject.  
• Serious protocol  violation  
 
• Patient is non -compliant or lost to  follow -up 
 
• Patient withdrawal of  consent  
 
• Patient  dies 
 
A patient may choose to discontinue participation in the study at any time. However, the Site 
Investigator or designee will encourage subjects who have initiated terlipressin treatment to 
continue with safety follow -up for 28 days after discontinuat ion of terlipressin infusion. 
If a patient permanently discontinues terlipressin infusion for safety reason the patient should 
continue safety follow -up as detailed by [CONTACT_194711] 28 days and the adverse event causing 
withdrawal should be followed unt il the event resolves or stabilizes.  
 
6.14. PATIENT  REPLACEMENT  
If a treated patient withdraws for a reason unrelated to drug toxicity, or is determined to be 
ineligible before dosing (based upon the requirements of this protocol), that patient will be 
replaced by [CONTACT_459801].  
Loss to follow -up should be prevented whenever possible and every attempt should be made to 
re-contact [CONTACT_102].  
Company Confidential  Document CIT -016-[ADDRESS_587244] to not continue 
safety monitoring per the study sc hedule should, whenever possible, complete an early study 
drug termination visit per protocol (Day 28 Visit).

6.17. MANAGEMENT  OF AES AND TREATMENT  DOSE  MODIFICATION  
Initial managemen t of treatment emergent A Es occurring during the in- house phase of the 
treatment and that do not meet the threshold for discontinuation of terlipressin infusion as 
detailed above, may be managed by a temporary interruption of terlipressin infusion based on 
clinical judgement and at the discretion of the Investigator. After dose interruption, if the AE 
has abated by 48 hr., terlipressin may be restarted at the starting dose of 2 mg terlipressin, at the 
discretion of the Investigator.  After restarting terlip ressin, the dose may NOT be increased to 
the previously reached dose level.  
There may be only one dose interruption for intercurrent AE. If the dose interruption is longer 
than 48 hr, then treatment will be discontinued and patient will start monitoring as  outlined in 
the Follow -up Period in S ection 6.4.7. 
Terlipressin infusion will also be briefly interrupted during and following paracentesis if one is 
required (refer to Section 6.11).  
Suspected acute liver injury (drug or ischemic induced) with elevated aminotransferases to m ore 
than 3xULN should be followed with a repeat liver panel testing within 48 hr (ALT. AST, 
alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin). If the repeat testing shows AST or ALT >3xULN for 
subjects with normal baseline measures or 2 -fold increases above baseline values for subjects 
with elevated values before drug exposure then close observation will be initiated including 
repeat liver enzyme testing every 3 days for no less than a week, ruling out viral he patitis or 
ischemic or alcoholic liver injury and review h istory of concomitant drug use or other agents.

pre-terlipressin baseline was elevated) the BP should be closely monitored with taking BP/HR at 
regular interval, no less than hourly, until stable.  
Sign of dehydration or rapid increase in sodium excretion possibly related to terlipressin 
response should be monitored closely. 
 
6.18. SAFETY MONITORING RULES  
The rates of AE of interest, SAEs, therapy interruptions for safety, and grade 3 or 4 treatment - 
related clinically significant toxicities (NCI Common Terminology Criteria for A dverse Events 
version 3.0) will be monitored. The first two patients in the trial (sentinel patients with baseline 
SCr < 1.5 mg/dL) will be monitored for emergence of these AEs until completion of terlipressin 
infusion. These patients may be replaced if th e study treatment is interrupted  for reason other 
than safety. Once at least [ADDRESS_587249] 4 weeks and safely complete 
terlipressin infusion, enrollment of subsequent patients may then resume at the discretion of the 
Principal Investigator. 
During the course of the trial, observance of 1 or more unexpected, clinically -significant AE as 
described above that is possibly, probably, or definitely related to protocol therapy should prompt 
consideration to amend or terminate the protocol.  
 
7. STATISTICS 
 
7.1. JUSTIFICATION OF SAMPLE  SIZE 
This study is a proof -of-concept study and the study is not powered for inferential statistics. The 
sample size chosen of this study is based on observations feasibility, data from a recently 
published study ( Gow, 2016) and hist orical first -in-man studies. However, the assumptions in 
this study include the following:  
• Patients are expected to have ascites requiring large volume paracentesis. It is 
assumed that the ascites volume pre- treatment is at least 5 L per paracentesis per 
patient (average volume of ascites 7 L) as per Gow 2016  study). 
• Patients are expected to require a minimum of 1.5 paracentesis procedures per  month 
with an average of 2 per  month.

For cirrhot ic patients with refractory ascites  Page 46 of 91  
Protocol CIT -001  
November 17 , 2018   
  
• The pre -treatment period will include the pre -treatment LVP be fore the terlipressin 
infusion is initiated. This LVP will occur when the patient would have normally 
needed it.  
• The total volume of ascites fluid removed during the pre -treatment period may be 
calculated as the product of the average ascites volume per pa racentesis (7 L) and the 
average number of paracentesis procedures during the course of the pre -treatment 
period, including the pre -treatment LVP.  
 
7.2. SAMPLE  SIZE  
This is a Phase I safety and feasibility study and no formal power analysis has been perfo rmed.  
 
7.3. DESCRIPTION OF STATISTICAL  METHODS  
All patients who received terlipressin will be included in the analysis of safety and tolerability. 
All patients who have a result for the baseline and a follow -up will be included for the analysis 
of pharmacodynam ics end -points.  
 
7.3.1.  Demographics, Baseline an d Other  Characteristics 
Subject characteristics (demographic information and pre -treatment measurements) will be 
summarized. All medical history and physical examination findings will be coded as appropriate 
and li sted by [CONTACT_1130].

[IP_ADDRESS].  Adverse Event  Analysis  
All Investigator- reported verbatim terms for AEs will be coded using the most current version of 
MedDRA coding and will be presented by [CONTACT_92869] (SOC) and preferred term 
(PRT). An overall summary of AEs will be pre sented to include the overall incidence and 
frequency of the following events: AE, related AE, severe AE, SAE, AE leading to 
discontinuation of study medication, and AE leading to interruption of study medication. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Safety  Laboratory  
Adverse events will be coded for purposes of summary by [CONTACT_49240]. The 
incidence of treatment emergent adverse events will be summarized and tabulated by [CONTACT_459802] -016-001 Continuous Infusion Terlipressin

and attribution. Serious adverse events and those l eading to study withdrawal will also be 
tabulated.  
The results of laboratory tests results at each study visit will be listed by [CONTACT_4676]. Values outside 
the normal range will be identified, with special attention given to those values the PI [INVESTIGATOR_459766]. Shift table or scatter plots of numeric laboratory 
parameters will be provided, depi[INVESTIGATOR_459767], as appropriate. Normal ranges will be 
incorporated. 
 
7.3.3.  Pharm acokinetics  
Pharmacokinetic analysis of terlipressi n will be performed by [CONTACT_459803] - 
time data for terlipressin and lysine vasopressin from patients to the following models (Gibaldi, 
1975 and Rowland, 1989):

The pharmacokinetic analysis will  involve individual fitting of the  data from the subjects. 
Individual pharmacokinetic analysis will be performed using the nonlinear mixed effects 
software program, NONMEM (vs 7.3, ICON Development Solutions, Hanover, Maryland). 
Pharmacokinetic parameters obtained from the model fitting in clude CL, K, and CL f. The 
model building and validation will follow previously described procedures (Fischer, 2014). 
Secondary (derived) parameters include: volume of distribution of terlipressin (V), area under 
the terlip ressin plasma concentration -time c urve from 0 to 24 hours (AUC Terlipressin 0 -24), area 
under the lysine vasopressin plasma concentration -time curve from 0 to 24 hours (AUC lysine 
vasopressin 0- 24), and average steady -state plasma concentrations (C ss- ave ) for terlipressin and 
lysine vaso pressin.  
Pharmacokinetic parameters will be summarized using standard descriptive statistics, including 
mean, median, SD, min, max, and CV%. Qualitative comparison of parameters between subjects 
with and without renal impa irment will be performed.  
The indi vidual PK analysis will be reported as a separate study report to be produced 
independently of the clinical study report.

7.3.4.  Evaluation of Pharmacokinetic  Design  
Simulations were used to evaluate the ability of the study to provide precise estimates of the 
pharmacokinetic parameters. The simulations were performed in NONMEM (vs 7.3, ICON 
Development Solutions, Hanover, Maryland) utilizing the one -compartment model with first 
order elimination and zero order infusion shown in equation 1.  Estimates of the 
pharmacokinetic parameters, inter -individual variability and residual variability were obtained 
from the literature (Forsling ML, Aziz LA, Miller M, Davis R, Donova n B. Conversion of 
triglycylvasopressin to lysine -vasopressin in man. J Endocr. 1980; 85:237 -244; Nilsson G, 
Lindbom P, Ohlin M, Berling R, Vernersson E. Pharmacokinetics of terlipressin after single IV. 
doses to healthy volunteers. Drugs Exptl Clin Res. 1990; 16:307- 314; Population 
pharmacokinetics report study OT -401). Fixed and random effect para meter values were 537 
ml/min for CL, 0.011 min-1 for k, 0.168 for the inter -individual variance for CL, 0.267 for the 
inter- individual variance (IIV) for k and 0 .123 for residual error. Simulations provided 300 
replicates of the pharmacokinetic dataset (nu mber of subjects and sampling times) specified in 
Section 6.7  Each simulated dataset was fit to the model.  
The mean, median and 95% confidence intervals from the model fitting of the replicated 
simulated datasets are shown i n the table below. The means and medians of the replications 
from the simulations closely agree with actual values, with relative differences of - 2.8% and  
-4.8% for CL and 6.8% and 5.2 % for k. Similarly, the modest coefficients of variation and 
narrow 95%  confidence show the precision of parameter estimates.

8. SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT  REPORTING  
 
8.1. DESCRIPTION OF ADVERSE  EVENTS  
The term “adverse event” could include any of the following eve nts that  develop or increase in 
severity during the course of the study:  
1. Any signs or symptoms, regardless of severity, and whether or not ascribed to 
the test  article;  
2. Any clinically significant laboratory abnormality,  and; 
 
3. Any abnormality detected during physic al examination.  
 
The Clinical Investigator will follow all subjects withdrawn from the study due to any adverse 
event, until the outcome is determined and where appropriate, additional written reports will be 
provided.  
Adverse events are graded using the C TCAE. If the CTCAE grading does not exist for an 
adverse event, the severity of mild (1), moderate (2), severe (3), life -threatening (4), and death 
related to an adverse event (5) will be used. Adverse event monitoring should be continued until 
adverse eve nt resolution/sta bilization (whichever is later).  
Medical conditions/diseases present before consenting the patient are only considered adverse 
events if they worsen after receiving any study drug. All laboratory values are to be reviewed by 
[CONTACT_459806].  
Company Confidential  Document CIT -016-[ADDRESS_587250] that is clinically significant or meets the definition of an 
SAE  
 
8.2. RELATIONSHIP  TO STUDY DRUG OR STUDY INTERVENTION  
The relationship of each adverse event to study drug or study intervention wil l be defined as 
“not related” or “related”. The Investigator is responsible for determining the relationship for an 
adverse event that occurs during the study.  
Not related: The temporal relationship of the clinical event to study intervention makes a causa l 
relationship unlikely , or other drugs, therapeutic interventions or underlying conditions provide 
a sufficient explanation for the observed event.  
Related: The temporal relationship of the clinical event to study intervention makes a causal 
relationship possible , and other drugs, therapeutic interventions or underlying conditions do not 
provide a sufficient explanation for the observed event.  
 
8.3. DESCRIPTION  OF AND PROCEDURAL  REQUIREMENTS  FOR  SERIOUS  ADVERSE  EVENTS  
A serious adverse event is defined in gener al as an untoward (unfavorable) adverse event which:  
 
1. Is fatal or life -threatening (defined as an event in which the subject was at risk of 
death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically 
might have caused death if it wer e more  severe);  
2. Requires or prolongs  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059];  
 
3. Is significantly or permanently disabling or incapacitating;  
 
4. Constitutes a congenital anomaly  or a birth defect;  or 
 
5. May jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed above (Examples of such events include, but  are

not limited to, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic 
bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]).  
Suspected transmission of an infectious agent (eg, any organism, virus or infectious particle, 
pathogenic or non- pathogenic) via the study drug is an SAE. 
Although pregnancy, overdose and cancer are not always serious by [CONTACT_8661], these 
events must be  handled as SAEs for data transmission purposes to BioVie Inc.  
The following hospi[INVESTIGATOR_459768]. clinical studies:  
 
1. A visit to the emergency room or other hospi[INVESTIGATOR_20347] < 24 hours, that does not 
result in admission  (unless considered "important medical event" or event life 
threatening)  
2. Elective surgery, planned prior to signing consent  
 
3. Admissions as per protocol for a planned medical/surgical  procedure  
 
4. Routine health assessment requiring admission for baseline/tre nding of health status (eg, 
routine  colonoscopy)  
5. Medical/surgical admission for purpose other than remedying ill health state and was 
planned prior to entry into the study. Appropriate documentation is required in these 
cases  
6. Admission encountered for anot her life circumstance that carries no bearing on health 
status and requires no medical/surgical intervention (eg, lack of housing, economic 
inadequacy, care -giver respi[INVESTIGATOR_040], family circumstances,  administrative).  
 
8.4. REPORTING RESPONSIBILITY  FOR SERIOUS  AE 
The study site team will monitor for and track seriou s adverse events whether related or not to 
the study procedures/interventions and/or to participation in the study. Such events will be 
reported to the Clinical Investigator and reported to IRB per their req uirements and pre - 
established written procedures, as required by [ADDRESS_587251] after he/she has provided informed consent and 
HIPAA authorization, and while in the study must be reported.  
Company Confidential  Document CIT -016-[ADDRESS_587252] complete the Serious Adverse Event Report Form in English, assess the 
causal relationship to study procedure/int ervention, and send the completed form to BioVie Inc. 
by [CONTACT_459807], to BioVie Inc. Medical Monitor or its designe e. The study monitor will 
review the Serious Adverse Event Report Form and the supporting source documents during 
monitoring visits. F ollow -up information should be sent as well, within 24 hours of the time the 
information is known. Either a new Serious Adverse Event Report Form is faxed (indicating that 
the information is a follow -up), or the original form may be re -faxed (with the new information 
highlighted and a new date provided). The follow -up report should describe whether the serious 
adverse event h as resolved or is continuing, if and how it was treated, and whether the subject 
continued or permanently discontinued study participa tion. The form(s) and FAX confirmation 
sheet(s) must be retained in the investigational site study file. The Investigator is responsible for 
informing the Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee (IRB/IEC) of the 
serious adverse event and pr oviding them with all relevant initial and follow -up information 
about the event. BioVie Inc. medical monitor or designee will communicate serious adverse 
events to the study sites as required by [CONTACT_12721]. SAEs must be recorded on the 
BioVie Inc. SAE Report Form; pregnancies on a BioVie Inc. Pregnancy Surveillance Form.

via a scanned and reported via electronic mail to:  
SAE Email Address: [EMAIL_8819]  
 
If only limited information is initially available, follow -up reports are required. (Note: Follow - 
up SAE reports should include the same investigator term(s) initially reported.)  
If an ongoing SAE changes in its intensity or relationship to study drug or if new information 
becomes available, a follow -up SAE report should be sent within [ADDRESS_587253] (IRB) in order to participate in the study. Prior to study initiation, the 
protocol and the informed consent docume nts will be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_459808] (ERC) or IRB. Any amendments to the protocol or consent materials 
must be approved before they are implemented. 
Study personnel involved in conducting this study will be qualified by [CONTACT_8640], training, and 
experience to perform their respective tasks. This study will not use the services of study 
personnel where sanctions have been invoked or where there has been scientific misconduct or 
fraud (e.g., loss of medical license, debar ment). All potential serious breaches must be reported 
to BioVie Inc. immediately. A serious breach is a breach of the conditions and principles of 
GCP in connection with the study or the protocol, which is likely to affect, to a significant 
degree, the sa fety or physical or mental integrity of the subjects of the study or the scientific 
value of the study.

All investigators will comply with the require ments of [ADDRESS_587255] an up - 
to date si gned financial disclosure form on file with the sponsor. 
 
9.4. SAFETY MONITORING COMMITTEE  
An independent Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC) composed of two physicians, with 
expertise with hepatology, cardiology and/or intensive care will be assembled for the duration of 
the trial. The SMC receives the summary reports of the frequency of a ll clinical adverse events 
and safety laboratory tests for planned periodic meetings throughout the study (after each 2 
patients complete treatment). Meetings will be held via teleconference. In addition, an SMC 
member may call ad hoc meetings.

For cirrhot ic patients with refractory ascites  Page 57 of 91  
Protocol CIT -001  
November 17 , 2018   
  
Summaries of safety monitoring, adverse events and enrollment will be provided to the SMC 
prior to each meeting by [CONTACT_459810]. In addition, clinically significant events 
(including AEs of interest and interruptions of infusion for safety r eason) an d any severe (Grade 
3 or above) or serious adverse events are considered events of interest and will be reported in 
real-time (within 1 business day of sponsor becoming informed) to the SMC. All adverse events 
and abnormal laboratory values result s will be  listed and will be completely identified (using 
MedDRA adverse reaction codes) by [CONTACT_1130].  
The SMC will review safety data throughout the trial. Recommendations for modification or 
termination of the trial based on safety data will be made by [CONTACT_459811] t he Protocol Steering 
Committee (PSC) that will include the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_459769].  The PSC will be responsible for communication with the sites and IRBs. 
 
9.5. INSTITUTIONAL  REVIEW  BOARD /INDEPENDENT  ETHICS  COMMITTEE  
Before implementing this study, the protocol, the proposed ICF, and other information provided 
to subjects must be reviewed by [CONTACT_2717]/IEC. A signed and dated statement that the protocol, 
and ICF, subject recruitment materials/process (eg,  advertis ements), and any other written 
information to be provided to subjects have been approved by [CONTACT_1201]/IEC must be given to 
BioVie Inc. before study initiation. The name [CONTACT_459831]/IEC (preferred) or the IRB’s  Health and Human Safety Assurance number 
must be supplied to BioVie Inc. or its designee. This committee, as required by [CONTACT_459812], will approve any amendments to the protocol that need formal approval. The 
IRB/IEC will also be notif ied of al l other administrative amendments (i.e., administrative 
changes). The investigator or sponsor should also provide the IRB/IEC with a copy of the 
Investigator Brochure or product labeling, information to be provided to subjects and any 
updates. The  investigator or sponsor should provide the IRB/IEC with reports, updates and other 
information (eg, expedited safety reports, amendments and administrative letters) according to 
regulatory requirements or institution  procedures. 
Study sites will be respon sible for  maintaining signed consent forms as source documents for 
quality assurance review and regulatory compliance.  
Company Confidential  Document CIT -016-[ADDRESS_587256] (or legally 
authorized representative) the nature of the research study, its purpose, the procedures involved, 
the expected duration of subject participation, alternative treatment, potential risks and benefits 
involved, and any discomfort that ma y occur during the sub ject’s participation in the study.  
Each subject will be informed that participation in the study is voluntary and that he/she may 
withdraw from the study at any time and that withdrawal of consent will not affect his/her 
subsequent medical treatment or rel ationship with the treating physici an. This informed consent 
should be given by [CONTACT_3553] a standard written statement, written in non- technical language.  
The subject should read and consider the statement before signing and dating it and should be 
given a copy of the signed document. No subject can enter the study and no study- related 
procedures can be done before his/her informed consent has been obtained. The Investigator 
must submit the ICF with the protocol for IRB/IEC approval. 
BioVie Inc. supplies a proposed ICF template that complies with regulatory requirements, 
includes all elements required by [CONTACT_12212], GCP and applicable regulatory requirements, and is 
considered appropriate for the study. The sample informed consent form will adhere to the 
ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. Any changes to the 
proposed ICF suggested by [CONTACT_459813]. or its designee 
before submission to the IRB/IEC, and a copy of the approved version must be provi ded to the 
BioVie Inc. study monitor after IRB/IEC approval.  
Investigators must:  
 
1. Provide a copy of the consent form and written information about the study in the 
language in which the subject is most proficient prior to clinical study participation. The 
language must be non- technical and easily  understood.  
2. Allow time necessary for subject or subject's legally acceptable representative to inquire 
about the details of the  study.

legally acce ptable representative and by [CONTACT_459814].  
4. Obtain the IRB/IEC’s written approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_459770], prior to the 
beginning of the study, and after any revisions are completed for new  information. 
5. If informed consent is initially given by a subject’s legally acceptable representative or 
legal guardian, and the subject subsequently becomes capable of m aking and 
communicating their informed consent during the study, then consent must  additionally 
be obtained from the  subject.  
6. Revise the informed consent whenever important new information becomes available 
that is relevant to the subject's consent. The in vestigator, or a person designated by [CONTACT_1275], should fully inform the subject or the subject's legally acceptable 
representative or legal guardian, of all pertinent aspects of the study and of any new 
information relevant to the subject's willing ness to continue participation in the study. 
This communication should be  documented.  
The consent form must also include a statement that BioVie Inc. and regulatory authorities have 
direct access to subject records. Subjects unable to give their written co nsent (eg, stroke patients, 
or subjects with severe dementia) may only be enrolled in the study with the consent of a legally 
acceptable representative. The subject must also be informed about the nature of the study to the 
extent compatible with the subje cts’ understanding, and should they become capable, personally 
sign and date the consent form as soon as possible. The explici t wish of a subject unable to give 
his or her written consent, who is capable of forming an opi[INVESTIGATOR_459771], or to be withdrawn from, the clinical study at any time should be 
considered by [CONTACT_093]. The rights, safety, and well -being of the study subjects are the 
most important considerations and should prevail over interests of science and society.

approved by [CONTACT_459815]. medical monitor before implementation. Amendments significantl y 
affecting the safety of subjects, the scope of the investigation, or the scientific quality of the 
study requir e additional approval by [CONTACT_1201]/IEC of all centers and, in some countries, by [CONTACT_188526]. A copy of the written approval of the IRB/IEC must be given to the BioVie 
Inc. study monitor, or their designee. Examples of amendments requiring such approval are:  
1. Increase in drug dosage or duration of exposure of subjects, or any significant 
increase in the number of subjects under  study;  
2. Significant change in the study design (e.g., addition or deletion of a control  group);  
 
3. Increase in the number of  procedures to which subjects are exposed;  or 
 
4. Addition or deletion of a test procedure intended to improve safety monitoring.  
 
These requirements for approval should in no way prevent any immediate action from being 
taken by [CONTACT_459816]. medical monitor in the interests of preserving the 
safety of all subjects included in the study. If an immediate change to the protocol is  felt by [CONTACT_459817]/her for safety reasons, BioVie Inc. 
medical monitor should be notified and the IRB/IEC for the center should be informed within [ADDRESS_587259](s) prior 
to obtaining IRB/IEC approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], as soon as possible the deviation or change

Company Confidential  Document CIT -016-[ADDRESS_587260]: (1) the consent form must be revised and submitted to the 
IRB(s)/IEC(s) for review and approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649]; (2) the revised form must be used to 
obtain con sent from subjects currently  enrolled in the study if they are affected by [CONTACT_124944]; and (3) the new form must be used to obtain consent from new subjects prior to 
enrollment. 
If the revision is an administrative letter, investigators must inform their IRB(s)/IEC(s).  
 
Amendments  affecting only administrative aspects of the study do not require formal protocol 
amendments or IRB/IEC approval; however, the IRB/IEC for each center m ust be kept informed 
of such administrative changes. Examples of administrative changes not requiring f ormal 
protocol amendments and IRB/IEC approval that can be treated as administrative amendments 
include, but are not limited to:  
1. Changes in the staff used to monitor studies (e.g., BioVie Inc. staff versus a contract 
research organization);  and 
2. Minor changes (within regulatory guidelines) in the packaging or labeling of study drug. 
 
10.2. MONITORING PROCEDURES  
Before study initiation, at an initiation visit conducted on- site or by [CONTACT_459819]’s meeting, a BioVie Inc. representative will review the protocol, CRFs, and other 
study documents with the Investigators and their staff. During the study, the BioVie Inc. s tudy 
monitor, or designee, will visit the site regularly to check the completeness of subject records, 
accuracy of entries on t he CRFs, adherence to the protocol and to GCP, progress of enrollment, 
and also to ensure that study drug is being stored, dispensed, and accounted for according to 
specifications.  
The Investigator must give the study monitor access to relevant hospi[INVESTIGATOR_459772]. No information in these records about the 
identity of the subjects will leave the study center. BioVie Inc. monitoring standards require full 
verification for the presence of informed consent, HIPAA authorization, adherence to the 
inclusion/exclusion criteria, documentation of serious adverse events, and recording of efficacy 
and safety variables. Additional checks of the consistency of source data with the CRFs are  
Company Confidential  Document CIT -016-[ADDRESS_587261] copi[INVESTIGATOR_459773]. 
 
10.3. PROTOCOL DEVIATION AND VIOLATION  
A protocol deviation is any noncompliance with the clinica l trial protocol, Good Clinical 
Practice (GCP). The noncompliance may be either on the part of the subject, the Site 
Investigator, or the study site staff. As a result of deviations, corrective actions are to be 
developed by [CONTACT_459820]. 
All deviations from the protocol must be addressed in the subject’s source documents. Protocol 
deviations must be sent to the local IRB per their guidelines and entered in the Protocol 
Deviations Log CRF.  
 
10.4. INVESTIGATIONAL SITE TRAINING  
BioVie Inc. may provide quality investigational staff training prior to study initiation. Training

research team authorized to make CRF entries. Corr ection fluid must not be used. If Electronic 
Data Capture (EDC) system is deployed, the CRF w ill be completed by [CONTACT_459821]. Electronic queries will be used to communicate eligible discrepant data with the 
study sites.  
The Investig ator must maintain source documents for each subject in the study. All information 
on CRFs wi ll be traceable to these source documents, which are generally maintained in the 
subject’s file. The source documents will contain all demographic and medical information, 
including laboratory data, ECGs, etc., and also a copy of the signed informed consent/HIPAA 
authorization, which should indicate the study number and title of the study. Essential 
documents, as listed below, will be retained by [CONTACT_459822], or insti tutional procedures, or for 
the period specified by [CONTACT_456], whichever is longer. BioVie Inc. will notify the 
Investigator(s)/institution(s) when study -related  records are no longer required to be retained.  
The Investigator agrees to adhere to the docu ment retention procedures by [CONTACT_12142]. 
The investigator must contact [CONTACT_459815]. prior to destroying any records associated with the 
study.  
If the inve stigator withdraws from the study (eg, relocation, retirement), the records shall be 
transfer red to a mutually agreed upon designee (eg, another investigator, IRB). Notice of such 
transfer will be given in writing to BioVie Inc. Essential documents include : 
1. Signed protocol and all  amendments;  
 
2. IRB/IEC approvals for the study protocol and all  amend ments;

10.6. CASE REPORT  FORMS  
An investigator is required to prepare and maintain adequate and accurate case histories 
designed to record all observations and other data pertinent to the investigation on each 
individual treated or  entered as a control in the investigation. Data reported on the CRF that are 
derived from source documents must be consistent with the source docum ents or the 
discrepancies must be explained.  
The confidentiality of records that could identify subjects mus t be protected, respecting the 
privacy and confidentiality rules in accordance with the applicable regulatory requirement(s). 
The investigator will maintain a signature [CONTACT_459832]/or corrections on CRFs. 
The completed CRF, including any paper SAE/pregnancy CRFs, must be promptly reviewed, 
signed, and dat ed by a qualified phys ician who is an investigator or sub- Investigator.  
The investigator must retain a copy of the CRFs including records of the changes and 
corrections.  
 
10.7. AUDITING PROCEDURES  
In addition to the routine monitoring procedures, BioVie Inc. or its designees, may conduct 
audits of clinical research activities in accordance with internal SOPs to evaluate compliance 
with the principles of GCP. BioVie Inc., its designee, or a regulatory authority may wish to 
conduct an inspection (during the study or after its completion). If an inspection is requested by 
a regulatory authority, the Investigator will inform BioVie Inc. immediately that this request has 
been made.  
 
10.8. DISCLOSURE AND CONFIDE NTIALITY

SHIPPI[INVESTIGATOR_459778] 
 
14.1. COLLECTION OF BLOOD SAMPLES  
Sample Collection and Processing Procedures  
 
Blood will be collected at the specified time points (refer to study protocol) using a 10 mL 
K2EDTA Vacutainer® blood collection tube. Collect samples within ± [ADDRESS_587266] any draw deviations and reason(s) for deviation(s) on the Sample Processing Log if the 
clinical site has. Place the blood samples in a refrigerated centrifug e within 1 hour of collection 
and spin at high speed (approxim ately 2700 -  3000 RPM or approximately 1000 g) for 
approximately 10 minutes at 4˚C. As soon as the centrifuge stops, return the samples to an ice 
bath. Withdraw about 2.5 mL of plasma into a appropriately labeled 5 -mL polypropylene 
cryovial as aliquot 1; t ransfer the rest of the plasma (transfer as much as possible) to a second 
appropriately labeled 5- mL polypropylene cryovial as aliquot 2. NOTE: Fill out sample label 
and affix on the tube before  placing plasma into the tube. Affix a pi[INVESTIGATOR_459779] b tape 
over the affixed label before transferring the plasma.  
 
14.3. SHIPPI[INVESTIGATOR_459780], Subject number, and time points (as 
indicated in the study protocol), aliquot # and stored in the sa me location until shipped. The 
tubes are to be labeled with freezer -safe labels and/or marked by [CONTACT_386741]. Sort the 
samples by [CONTACT_459826] a box or small zipper bag and pla ce the samples in the

15. APPENDIX 3 – BLOOD PRESSURE  MEASUREMENT  
 
 
- Ensure the patient has been sitting for at least [ADDRESS_587270] an appropriately sized cuff: its bladder should encirc le at least 80% of the 
arm but no more than 100%. 
- Place the cuff snugly onto the patient’s arm with the center of the bladder over 
the brachial artery. Most cuffs have a ‘brachial artery indicator’, an arrow that 
can be aligned with the  artery.  
- Ask the pat ient to refrain from talking or eating during the procedure  as this can 
result in an inaccurate higher blood pressure measurement being  recorded.  
- Switch on the automated device and press start.  
 
- Document the systolic and diastolic blood pressures on the patient’s observation 
chart.  
- Compute the  MAP.  
 
- Let the patien t sit for 5  minutes. 
 
- Proceed to determine the repeat MAP  measure.  
 
- Enter the average of the two MAPS in the CRF.

16. APPENDI X 4 – CHILD -PUGH SCORE  
 
 
 
 
The score employs five clinical measures of liver disease. Each measure is scored [ADDRESS_587271] severe derangement.  
 
Measure  1 point  2 points  3 points  
Total bilirubin , μmol/L (mg/dL)  <34 (<2)  34-50 (2- 3) >50 (>3)  
Serum albumin , g/dL  >3.5 2.8-3.5 <2.8 
Prothrombin time , prolongation (s)  <4.0 4.0-6.0 > 6.0 
 
Ascites   
None  Mild (or 
suppressed with 
medication)   
Moderate to Severe 
(or refractory) 
Hepatic encephalopathy  None  Grade I -II Grade III -IV 
 
 
Chronic liver disease is classified into Child -Pugh class A to C, employing the added score from 
above.

17. APPENDIX 5 – MELD  SCORE  
 
 
MELD(i) uses the patient's values for serum bilirubin , serum creatinine, and the international  
normalized ratio for prothrombin time (INR) to predict survival. It is calculated according to the 
following formula:  
MELD(i) = 3.78×ln[serum bilirubin (mg/dL)] + 11.2×ln[INR] + 
9.57×ln[serum creatinine (mg/dL)] + 6.43 
MELD scores are reported as whole numbers, so the result of the equation above is rounded. 
UNOS has made the following modifications to the score:[5] 
• If the patient has been dialyzed twice within the last 7 days, then the factor for serum 
creatinine used should be  4.0 
• Any value less than one is given a value of 1 (i.e. if bilirubin is 0.8 a value of 1.0 is used) 
to prevent the occurrence of scores below  0 
In January 2016, OPTN Policy 9.1 (MELD Score) was updated to include serum sodium as a 
factor in the calculation of the MELD score.  
MELD Score (2016) = MELD(i) + 1.32*(137- Na) – [0.033*MELD(i)*(137- Na)] 
 
Note: Sodium has a range of 125- 137 mEq/L

19. APPENDIX 7 – HEPATIC ENCEPHALOPATHY SCORE  
 
 
The severity of hepatic encephalopathy is graded with the West Haven Criteria; this is based on 
the level of impairment of autonomy, changes in consciousness , intellectual function, behavior, 
and the dependence on therapy.  
• Grade 1 -  Trivial lack of awareness; euphoria or anxiety; shortened attention span; 
impaired performance of addition or  subtraction  
• Grade 2 -  Lethargy or apathy ; minimal disorientation for time or place; subtle personality 
change; inappropriate  behaviour  
• Grade 3 -  Somnolence to semi stupor , but responsive to verbal stimuli; confusion; gross 
disorientation  
• Grade 4 -  Coma

1.0 Objectives  
1.1 Study Objectives  
 
This study will determine whether the negative effects of combined oral contraceptive (COC) therapy on  bone turnover ar e 
dependent on the route of administration such that an attenuation of these effects is  observed when a comparable dose of 
non-oral transdermal contraceptive (TDC) therapy  and contraceptive vaginal ring  (-CVR ) therapy  are also tested. Millions of 
women use  COC therapy for birth control purposes or regulation of menstrual cycles.  TDC and CVR therap ies are relatively 
new FDA-approved contraceptive alternative s to COC .  The purpose of the proposed project is to address the potential 
mechanism(s) by [CONTACT_303002] (EE) may negatively impair bone via “first pass” effects on the liver and compare 
these effects to transdermally -administered and vaginally -administered EE in young women. We will assess mechanistic 
effects by [CONTACT_34058] 2 -day serial samplin g and by [CONTACT_303003] -like growth factor (IGF -1) generation test. The IGF -[ADDRESS_370005] 
was developed over 20 years ago and is currently used to diagnose growth hormone (GH) insensitivity (Balhara et al., 2012; 
Buckway et al., 2001). IGF -1 generation tes ts may also be used to amplify effects not observable by [CONTACT_303004] -1(secreted by [CONTACT_4852]) and its associated binding proteins (Balhara et al., 2012; 
Buckway et al., 2001). This study will be the fi rst study to examine the physiological mechanisms whereby [CONTACT_303005]/IGF -1 axis and bone turnover in young women.  
 
The overall purpose  of this study is to explore differences in liver metabolism and bone turnover of oral versus transdermal 
and vaginal contraceptive therapy.   In an effort to expose the route -dependent effects of oral versus transdermal and vaginal 
contraceptive therapy on liver and bone metabolism , we will examine the effects of ethinyl estradiol on serially -assessed 
fasting concentrations of the GH/IGF -[ADDRESS_370006] as a probe.  
 
 
Page 4 of 37 (V. 12/5/2013)  Specific Aim 1:   To examine the effects of oral , transdermal , and vaginal  contraceptive therapy on serially -assessed 
fasting concentrations of the GH/IGF -1 axis.  
 
Hypothesis 1A:   Significant declines in IGF -1 concentrations will be observed following COC  therapy; whereas, TDC and 
CVR therapy will result in less severe declines or no change in IGF -1 concentrations , similar to Control.  
Hypothesis 1B:  The most unfavorable alterations in the IGF -1 binding proteins (IGFBP -3, IGFBP -1) and the acid labile 
subuni t (ALS) concentrations will be observed following COC therapy compared to TDC  and CVR  therapy and compared to 
Control.  
 
Specific Aim 2:  To examine the physiological mechanisms underlying the hepatic responsiveness to oral , 
transdermal , and vaginal  contrac eptive therapy by [CONTACT_303006]/IGF -[ADDRESS_370007].  
 
Hypothesis 2A:   GH-stimulated IGF -1 concentrations will be reduced to a greater extent following COC therapy compared to 
TDC and CVR therapy and co mpared to Control.  
Hypothesis 2B:  GH-stimulated alterations in IGFBP1 and IGFBP3  will be less favorable following COC therapy compared to 
TDC and CVR  therapy and compared to Control.  
 
Specific Aim 3:   To examine the effects of oral, transdermal, and vagin al contraceptive  therapy on serially -assessed 
fasting concentrations of markers of bone turnover.  
 
Hypothesis 3A:   A significant reduction  in serum markers of bone formation (osteocalcin, P1NP) will be observed following 
COC therapy; whereas, TDC and CVR  therapy will result in less severe reductions or no change in markers of bone formation, 
similar to controls.  
Hypothesis 3B:   A significant reduction  in serum markers of bone resorption (NTx and CTx) will be observed following COC 
therapy; whereas, TDC and CVR therapy will result in less severe reductions or no change in markers of bone resorption, 
similar to controls.  
 
1.2 Primary Study Endpoints  
1) Serially -sampled fasting serum concentrations of IGF -1, IGFBP -1, IGFBP -3, and ALS before and after 
contraceptive the rapy  
2) Serially -sampled fasting serum concentrations of osteocalcin, P1NP, NTx, and CTx  before and after 
contraceptive therapy  
3) The response of IGF -1, IGFBP -1, IGFBP -3,and ALS to exogenous ly administered GH before and after 
contraceptive therapy.   
1.3 Secondar y Study Endpoints  
Preadipocyte factor 1 (Pref -1) and sclerostin, two proteins that have recently been observed to play a role in bone 
health in adolescent girls and women ( Fazeli et al., 2010 a; Fazeli et al., 2013) , may also be assessed.  
 
2.0 Background   
 
2.1 Scientific Background and Gaps  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_302944] (COC) therapy, investigators to date  
have failed to definitively answer a basic question: Is COC therapy helpful or harmful to bone health in the 18 million 
premenopausal wome n who use them (Enewold et al., 2010). Since COC  preparations are often adopted for use by 
[CONTACT_303007], understanding the negative outcomes on bone are critically important.  For physically active 
women, COC use may pose a unique threat since recent findings suggest that COC in combination with exercise 
may be particularly detrimental to bone (Weaver et al., 2001; Burr et al., 2000). The physiological  mechanism for the 
harmful effects of COC use on bone likely involves the growth hormone (GH)/ insulin -like growth factor -1 (IGF -1) axis 
and suppression of IGF -1 production, and these effects may be dependent on the route of contraceptive 
administration (Leung et al., 2004). Transdermal  contraceptive (TDC) and vaginal contraceptive ( CVR ) therap ies may 
 
Page 5 of 37 (V. 12/5/2013)  offer good alternative s to COC therapy because they may not suppress hepatically -driven IGF -[ADDRESS_370008] comparisons among  COC , TDC, and 
CVR  therap ies that explore the influenc e of contraceptives on the GH -IGF-1 axis  in healthy young  women. The 
proposed study will address this major gap in the literature.  
 
2.2 Previous Data  
 
1) Prior work by [CONTACT_978] (De Souza) demonstrated the negative impact of COC use on bone turnover 
in young wome n (Vescovi et  al., 2008) .  
 
Premenopausal women with exercise associated menstrual disturbances (EAMD) (n=6) were assigned to receive 
two weeks of COC therapy (EAMD+OC) or not (EAMD Control) (n=6). COC therapy was one 28 -day cycle of 
norgestimate (NGM) and  ethinyl estradiol (EE). After two weeks, serum concentrations of a marker of bone 
formation, PI[INVESTIGATOR_680], and a marker of bone resorption, sCTX, were reduced by 30 -40% in EAMD+OC when compared to 
EAMD Controls (+14%).  This finding has been reported by [CONTACT_2312] (G rinspoon et al., 2003; Warren et al., 2005) in 
response to a randomized clinical trial (RCT) (Grinspoon et al,. 2003) over a longer time frame of 10 months (Warren 
et al., 2005). Reductions in bone turnover could compromise bone remodeling in exercising wo men.  
 
2) Prior work by a co -investigator (Misra) demonstrated that treatment with transdermal estradiol 
among anorexic girls resulted in a significant increase in lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_302945] (Misra et al., 2011).  
 
Anorexic girls (n=96) were randomized to undergo an 18 -month treatment with either 100 ug 17B estradiol (with 
progesterone) or placebo transdermally.  At the end of the intervention period, girls who received transdermal 
estradiol demonstrated  greater increases in Z -scores at the lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (p=0.03) compared to those girls who 
received placebo.   
 
2.3 Study Rationale  
 
COC use is associated with a higher risk of fracture and may impair optimal bone health in adolescents and young 
women.  
 
An increa sed risk of fracture has been reported in COC “ever users” (Cooper et al., 1993), “current and recent users” 
(Vessey et al., 1998), subgroups of women with longer use (> 8 years) (Vessey et al., 1998) , and  also in younger 
women (<25 years) and those with a  “low dose average”  (Vestergaard et al., 2006). In addition,  RCTs report 
decreases in areal and volumetric BMD at the spi[INVESTIGATOR_050], radius, tibia, and in trabecular bone following COC use  
(Berenson et al., 2004; Hartard et al., 2006) .  
 
For Physically Active Wome n, COC Use May Pose a Unique Threat  
 
Recent studies suggest that low dose COC therapy and, surprisingly, its use in combination with exercise, may be 
detrimental to bone and cause decreases in bone mineral density (BMD) .   In the only prospective study tha t 
evaluated the impact of COC use in women randomized to an osteogenic exercise program for 24 months,  Weaver 
et al. (2001) reported a decrease  in spi[INVESTIGATOR_302946] (BMC) and BMD among women taking COCs and 
participating in exercise training comp ared to women who were not taking COC and participating in the same 
exercise intervention. Moreover, Burr et al. (2000) reported in the same study that the women who neither exercised 
nor took COC had the greatest improvement in bone strength, total BMD, a nd fracture index.  Hartard et al. (1997) 
found  the highest BMD in women aged 25 -35 years who were characterized by [CONTACT_7419] -term exercise (9.4±4.3yr) and 
short term use of COC (1.6±1.7 yrs).   No beneficial effect of exercise on BMD was evident in the group w ho 
performed long term exercise (10.4±4.1 yr) and also had a long term intake of COC (8.2±4.1yr).   Lastly, women 
aged 19 -23 years who received COC treatment (20μg EE, 150μg desogestrel) for 5 years demonstrated no change 
in spi[INVESTIGATOR_302947] 5 years of treatment; however, in the women not taking COC, a 7.8% increase in spi[INVESTIGATOR_302948], indicating that COC may suppress bone accrual in young women (Polatti et 
 
Page 6 of 37 (V. 12/5/2013)  al., 1995). The negative findings described above involving the ass ociation between physical activity, COC use, and 
bone health support the proposed study’s exploration of the effects of different contraceptives on the GH -IGF-1 axis 
in women of varying activity level s. 
 
The underlying physiological mechanisms for the harm ful effects of COC on bone likely involves the growth 
hormone/insulin -like growth factor -1 (GH/IGF -1) axis which are likely dependent on the route of administration.  
 
GH is released by [CONTACT_303008][INVESTIGATOR_302949]-1, a hormone with potent 
anabolic effects on bone.  Specific receptors for IGF -1 are present on fibroblasts and osteoblasts and IGF -1 directly 
stimulates collagen synthesis, highlighting the importance of IGF -1 on multiple components of skeletal tissu e.  The 
negative alterations observed in the GH/IGF -[ADDRESS_370009] be administe red due to the reduced bioavailability of the hormone after active metabolism by [CONTACT_4852].  The 
synthesis of hormones, growth factors, and binding proteins by [CONTACT_303009] “first -pass” 
effect.  As such, it is speculated that th e “first -pass” effect of oral estrogen suppresses IGF -1 production and 
upregulates the synthesis of certain binding proteins, such as insulin -like growth factor binding protein -1 (IGFBP -1), 
which bind to IGF -1 further reducing its bioavailability.  Insulin -like growth factor binding protein -3 (IGFBP -3) and the 
acid labile subunit (ALS) are both bound to IGF -1 as well, forming a ternary complex.   Thus, this “first pass” effect of 
oral estrogens on the GH/IGF -1 axis is proposed to be one of the primary mecha nisms explaining why COC therapy 
has been associated with negative effects on bone health.     
 
On the other hand, transdermal 17β -estradiol (E 2) administration does not appear to impact the GH/IGF -1 axis in the 
same manner as orally -administered estrogens (EE, conjugated equine estrogens (CEE), or E 2).   Estrogens 
administered transdermally or vaginally are absorbed directly into the systemic circulation, circumventing the portal 
circulation that follows intestinal absorption, i.e., the “first pass” effect.     In fact, GH, IGF -1, IGFBP -1, and IGFBP -3 
concentrations during treatment with transderm al E2 remain unchanged or increased compared to pre -treatment 
values in postmenopausal women (Kam et al., 2000; Helle et al., 1996; Bellantoni et al., 1996; Paassilt a et al., 2000; 
Weissberger et al., 1991).  Thus, transdermally administered EE may likely exert less negative effects on the 
GH/IGF -[ADDRESS_370010] less negative effects on the GH/IGF -1 axis as well when compared to orally -
administered estrogens.  To date, the effects of transdermal  and vaginal  EE therapy on these factors has yet to be 
fully described in premenopausal women .  
 
Data  on the GH/IGF -[ADDRESS_370011], 
quite scarce.  In a cross -sectional analysis examining the effects of COC in young women aged 24 years, lower 
serum IGF -1, higher serum IGFBP -1, and no differences in serum GH and IGFBP -3 concentrations were observed in 
the women taking oral EE compared to non -users  (Hansen et al., 2009).    Similarly, treatment with two different COC 
formulations, one containing EE and dienogest and the other conta ining EE and levonogestrel, for 21 days resulted in 
a significant decrease in serum IGF -1 concentrations in both groups of young women compared to baseline values  
(Balogh et al., 2000).   On the other hand, a small prospective study of transdermal EE in fiv e adolescent girls aged 
12-21 years demonstrated no change in IGF -1 after 12 months of treatment  (Harel et al,. 2010).   Prospective studies 
comparing oral and transdermal therapy have only been conducted in premenopausal women with hypopi[INVESTIGATOR_302950] (Nabhan et al,. 2009; Isotton et al., 2012; 
Janssen et al., 2000). With the exception of the study in adolescents with Turner Syndrome in which no differences in 
IGF-1 concentrations were observed b etween the girls taking oral CEE and transdermal E 2  (Nabhan et al., 2009), 
these  prospective studies also demonstrated a suppressive effect of oral E 2 on serum IGF -1 concentrations 
compared to transdermal E 2 (Isotton et al., 2012; Janssen et al., 2000) . To date, there are no direct comparisons 
among the effects of oral,  transdermal , and vaginal  contraceptive therapy  on the GH/IGF -1 axis  in healthy 
premenopausal women.  As such, transdermal contraceptive (TDC) and contraceptive vaginal ring (CVR ) therapy 
may offer a promising alternative to COC therapy because it may not suppress key anabolic factors necessary for 
optimal hepatically -driven anabolic effects on bone.  The proposed study will address this major gap in the literature.    
 
Two mechanisms for the  suppression of IGF -[ADDRESS_370012] been proposed.   
 
Page 7 of 37 (V. 12/5/2013)   
The first mechanism that may be contributing to the suppression of IGF -[ADDRESS_370013] has been observed in postmenopausal women with oral administration of estrogen 
(EE, CEE, and estradiol valerate) (Weissberger et al., 1991; Kelly et al., 1993); however, no suc h effect has been 
described in premenopausal women to date.   
 
A second mechanism that may be contributing to the suppression of IGF -[ADDRESS_370014] has been used to assess the responsiveness and/or sensitivity of 
the liver to GH in various disease states such as obesity and GH -deficiency (Gleeson et al,. 2005; Buckway et al., 
2001) and in adults duri ng hormone therapy  (Lissett and Shalet, 2003; Lieberman et al., 1994).  Lieberman et al. 
(1994), the first investigator to use the IGF -[ADDRESS_370015] in adults, reported that postmenopausal women on 
estrogen therapy demonstrated an attenuated increase in IGF -1 concentrations after GH administration compared to 
women not on estrogen therapy. Similarly, Lissett and Shalet (2003) used the IGF -[ADDRESS_370016] in 9 
postmenopausal women treated with three different formulations of estrogen for 6 weeks follo wed by [CONTACT_1629] 8 -week 
washout period between each treatment phase.  The estrogen formulations included oral estradiol valerate, a low 
dose transdermal E 2 (50 ug/d) and high dose transdermal E 2 (200 ug/d).  In response to GH stimulation, serum IGF -1 
concentratio ns were significantly lower after oral estrogen treatment and high dose transdermal treatment than prior 
to estrogen treatment.  However, with low dose transdermal E 2, serum IGF -1 concentrations were no different in 
response to GH administration than those  measured prior to treatment.   All three estrogen formulations caused a 
reduced response of IGFBP -3 to GH stimulation; however, an attenuated response of ALS was only observed during 
transdermal treatment (both high and low dose).  These results indicate that the suppressed IGF -[ADDRESS_370017] of exogenous estrogens 
used for contraceptive purp oses on the GH/IGF -1 axis and perhaps help to explain some of the negative effects of 
COC therapy on the skeleton.

6.0 Study Design and Procedures  
 
6.1 Study  Design  
 
Summary of Study Design :  The proposed study is a preclinical trial comparing the short -term effects of oral and 
non-oral EE on the GH/IGF -[ADDRESS_370021] 
the effects of  2 cyc les of COC ,TDC, and CVR  use on the GH/IGF -1 axis.  The primary outcome variables are the key 
endocrine components of the GH/IGF -1 axis (IGF -1, IGFBP -1, IGFBP -3, ALS ) and bone markers (osteocalcin, P1NP, 
NTx, CTx) in the serially -sampled fasted state  (Speci fic Aim 1  and 3 ) and following an IGF -[ADDRESS_370022] 
(Specific Aim 2).   
 
There will be a total of 4 groups in the study as described below. There will be three  intervention groups: Group 1 will 
take 2 cycles of COC therapy ( 56 days ),Group 2 will take 2 cycles of TDC therapy ( 56 days ), and Group 3 will take 2 
cycles of CVR therapy ( 56 days ). There will be a control group who will be asked not to take hormonal contraceptive 
therapy. All subjects will be asked to make no change in food intake and physical activity for the study duration.  
 
Primary variables for Specific Aim 1 and 3 include the GH/IGF -1 axis (IGF -1, IGFBP -1, IGFBP -3, ALS) and markers 
of bone metabolism (osteocal cin, P1NP, NTx, CTx), and will be assessed using fasting blood samples (collected  for 2 
consecutive days) during the Baseline Period and during a Post Study Period .   Study drug will be  maintained  until 
post-testing is complete .  Primary variables for Specific Aim 2 (IGF -[ADDRESS_370023]) will also include the GH/IGF -1 
axis as describ ed above  and will be assessed at the same intervals (baseline and post -study period) .  Exogenous 
GH will be administered for this aim and  one repeated session of 5-hour serial blood sampling may be performed at 
both baseline and post -study  to determine concentration s of GH.  COC ,TDC, and CVR  use will be monitored with the 
use of calendars and blood measures of sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) . Physical activity will be monitored 
with the use of physical activity logs . 
Detailed Study Design:   This is a pro spective study with repeated measures, simple random assignment using 
blocks of 3 according to preference for contraceptive therapy  (COC ,TDC, or CVR ).  Those interested in contraceptive 
therapy will be randomized to the COC , TDC , or CVR group .  A group n ot interested in hormonal contraceptive 
strategies will serve as the control group (Control).

4) Control Group     Control    No COC , TDC, or CVR  
           
 The COC we have chosen, Apri, is a mo nophasic dosing regimen of [ADDRESS_370024]  (35µg/d EE/150µg/d norelgestromin) was chosen because it is the generic version of the original 
TDC delivery system and is currently the only TDC system available that is approved for use by [CONTACT_303016] 2015.  
The CVR  NuvaRing (15µg/d EE/120µg/d etonogestrel ) was chosen because it is the o nly combined  CVR  delivery 
system curre ntly available that is approved for use by [CONTACT_303016] 2013.  We are purposely not randomizing 
subjects to either take or abstain from contraception hormone therapy, as the request to abstain from contraceptive 
use would likely be associated with high le vels of noncompliance and cross over between those randomized to 
receive COC ,TDC, or CVR  therapy and those not. Although this investigation is a short -term preclinical trial, most 
published RCTs of contraceptive therapy have not randomized on this aspect o f the design for similar reasons (Nappi 
[CONTACT_2297]., 2003; Berenson et al., 2001; Gargano et al., 2008; Paoletti et al., 2000 ). The Control group will complete all 
procedures with the exception of contraceptive therapy.  
 
Phases of the study: Please see figure [ADDRESS_370025]-study phase.  
 
Screening:  After subjects are recruited and sig n 
the informed consent, screening will involve 
collection of anthropometric data; completion of 
questionnaires to assess calcium intake, health 
and medical history, exercise history, and 
menstrual history ; a blood sample, physical 
exam, and urinary pregnan cy test.   
 
Baseline (~28 days):    The Baseline Period will 
last for one month and will involve a body 
weight, whole body DXA scan to assess body 
composition, pregnancy test  (prior to DXA and 
GH administration) , maximal oxygen 
consumption (VO2max) test to assess aerobic 
fitness, and completion of a menstrual calendar  
and exercise training log ..  Subjects will also 
begin taking cal cium and Vitamin D 
supplements .  The baseline period will also include collection of 2 -day fasting samples to establish baseline 
concentrations of the GH/IGF -[ADDRESS_370026] .  One fasting blood sample will also be 
collected on day 2, day 4, and day 6 after administration  of exogenous GH begins .  Finally, one blood sample will be 
collected during baseline (between days 10 -22) to assess concentrations of SHBG.  
 
Intervention ( 2 cycles ):  The Baseline Period will be followed by 2 cycles (56 days)  of an Intervention Period and  a 
Post Study Period during which study drug is maintained.   If randomized to COC, 2 cycles  of COC therapy (Apri (or 
generic) , 30µg EE/ 150 µg desogestrel ) will be administered. If randomized to TDC, 2 cycles  of TDC therapy (Xulane , Figure 1.  Study Design  
CVR  
 
Page 13 of 37 (V. 12/5/2013)  35µg/d EE /150µg/d norelgestromin) will be administered.  If randomized to CVR , 2 cycles  of CVR  therapy 
(NuvaRing , 15µg/d EE/120µg/d etonogestrel ) will be administered.  The Control group will receive no intervention.  
Study procedures during the intervention phase include measurement of body weight and completion of a menstrual 
and contraceptive therapy log and exercise logs .  Supplementation with calcium and vitamin D will continue. A 
monthly blood sample will be collected during the intervention period for the ana lysis of SHBG  as a measure of 
compliance to the contraceptive therapy  (between days 10 -22 of each cycle) . 
 
Post-Study Period ( ~14 days):   The post -study period will commence between days 15 -17 of contraceptive cycle 2  or 
days 2 -7 of menstrual cycle 2 for t he control group , and the study drug will be maintained  in the contraceptive groups .  
During days 15-17/2-7 of cycle 2,  collection of 2 -day fasting samples to establish concentrations of the GH/IGF -1 axis 
and bone markers will occur.  F asting q1hr serial b lood sampling for 5 hours may be conducted  before administration 
of exogenous GH for 4 days (IGF -[ADDRESS_370027])  (at the discretion of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_302953] ).  If it 
occurs, it will coincide with the first day of consecutive blood sample s.  The procedure will mimic the procedure 
conducted during baseline in that fasting q1hr serial blood sampling for 5 hours will occur the day prior to 
commencement of subcutaneous administration of GH.  One fasting blood sample will also be drawn on day 2, day 4, 
and day 6 after initiating the GH administration  (IGF-[ADDRESS_370028]) .   During the post -study period, the following 
procedures will also be completed: measurement of body weight, urinary pregnancy test  (prior to GH administration) , 
and complet ion of menstrual and contraceptive therapy logs and exercise training logs .  A monthly blood sample will 
also be collected for analysis of SHBG to assess compliance to the therapy  (between days 10 -22 of the second 
intervention cycle) . 
 
We chose to continue  therapy during the post -study time period because 1) we wanted a minimal yet adequate 
treatment period, 2) we wanted to allow ample time to schedule all follow -up testing , particularly when considering 
that the follow -up procedures require about 12 days t o complete , and 3) because it is essential that testing occur 
while still on therapy.   
 
6.2 Study P rocedures  (For a detailed schematic of study timeline and procedures, please see 
uploaded “study timeline” document).  
 
6.2.1 Screening: After study procedures have been explained and the informed consent has been signed, the 
following screening procedures will occur.  The screening procedures may be completed in one study visit 
or multiple study visits depending on the subject’s preference and schedule.  
 
Body We ight/BMI:  Participants will be weighed to the nearest 0.01kg on a digital scale in the laboratory with a 
standard outfit of tee shirt and gym shorts. At the first visit, body height will also be measured. Body mass index 
(BMI) will be calculated from weigh t (kg) and height (m2).   
 
Questionnaires:   Participants will be asked to fill out: 1) a health, exercise and nutrition survey ( demographic, 
menstrual, and medical history questionnaires which include prescription medications, NSAID use, history of weight,  
COC use, exercise patterns, dietary practices, use of supplements, and a physical activity survey ); 2) the bone -
specific physical activity questionnaire  (BPAQ) , 3) the brief calcium assessment tool (BCAT), and 4 ) a medical history 
questionnaire for the cl inical research center (CRC).    
 
Physical Exam:  Participants will undergo a physical exam conducted by a physician or nurse practitioner at the CRC 
to assess general health and to assess if there are any contraindications to a hormonal contraceptive strat egy.  
Participants  age [ADDRESS_370029] 36 months ; otherwise, they 
will be excluded from the study .    
 
Pregnancy Test:   Pregnancy tests will be performed using urinary human chorionic gonadotropin dur ing Screening.  If 
a subject is pregnant, she will be informed immediately and excluded from the study.  
 
Blood Sample: A fasting (no food or drink, except water, [ADDRESS_370030]) blood sample will be 
taken for analysis of 1) complete blood count and chemistry panel, and 2) selected endocrine hormones.  To control 
 
Page 14 of 37 (V. 12/5/2013)  for normal changes in blood hormone levels that occur throughout the day and/or with changes in posture, samples 
will be drawn while in a fasted state, supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547], betwee n 7-10:00 a.m. and before exercise.   
 
6.2.2 Baseline: After subjects complete screening, the Baseline Period will begin on the first day of their next 
menstrual period and continue until the first day of their next menstrual period. During this time the 
following procedures for Baseline will occur.  The number of visits and the length of each visit will be 
determined by [CONTACT_423]’s preference and schedule.  
 
2-day Fasting  Blood Sampling to Establish Fasting Concentrations of GH/IGF -1 Axis  and Bone Metabol ism:  During 
days 2 -7 of the baseline period , blood will be obtained on 2 consecutive days for the IGF -1-related measures of  IGF-
1, IGFBP -1, IGFBP -3, and ALS, and for markers of bone turnover .  Subjects will report to the CRC in the fasted state 
(no food f or 8 hours prior  the appointment) in the morning on [ADDRESS_370031] :  To assess the impact of COC/TDC /CVR therapy on responsiveness to GH, the IGF -[ADDRESS_370032] two weeks of baseline.   
 
On the second day of the 2 -day fasting blood samples , study participants will be injected subcutaneously with  
recombinant human GH (r hGH) ( Omnitrope ) in the morning by a nurse at the CRC  at a dose of 0.033 mg/kg/d 
subcutaneously (Coutant et al., 2012). This dose  has previously been used in adults without side effects and is 
comparable to that administered in th e laboratory of our co -investigator, [CONTACT_303037] ( Fazeli, et al., 2010 b).  These 
injections will occur each morning for the following [ADDRESS_370033]: On day 1 of the 2 -day fasting blood sampling (explained above and 
occurring between days 2 -7 of baseline), an IV will be inserted and blood will be collected each hour for 5 hours in 
the fasted state (q1hr serial blood sampling for 5 hours).  The first draw will be collected [ADDRESS_370034] draw will be assayed for GH, IGF -1, IGFBP -1, IGFBP -3, and ALS; whereas, the remaining 5 draws will only be 
assayed for GH  due to its diurnal rhythm .   
 
Blood Sample for  SHBG : In order  to establish estrogen exposure in the participants, a blood sample will be drawn 
between days [ADDRESS_370035].   
 
Body Weight/BMI:  Participants will be weighed weekly during the baseline phase to the nearest 0.01kg on a digital 
scale in the laboratory with a standard outfit of tee shirt and gym shorts. Body mass index (BMI) will be calcu lated 
from weight (kg) and height (m2) (height measured during screening).   
 
Body Composition Test:  Body composition will be assessed using a  total body scan on a GE Lunar iDXA (dual -
energy x -ray absorptiometry or “DXA”).  All scans will be performed by a  technician certified by [CONTACT_303017]. Prior to this test, a urinary pregnancy test will be performed as a precaution.    
 
VO 2max:   A maximal oxygen consumption test (VO2max) will be performed to determine fitness leve l.  After a [ADDRESS_370036] requires the participant to jog or run on a treadmill while the treadmill increases in speed 
 
Page 15 of 37 (V. 12/5/2013)  and/or slope.  The test usually lasts about [ADDRESS_370037] calorimetry will be used to determine the maximal oxygen consumption.  
 
 
Physical Activity:   Subjects will record any exercise  they perform over 7 days using physical activity logs for one week 
during the Baseline Period.  Physical activity will be quantified by [CONTACT_303018]/week, average MET level, mode, frequency, 
intensity, and total exercise volume. Subjects will be instructed to main tain their typi[INVESTIGATOR_302954].  
 
Menstrual Calendar :   Subjects will complete a menstrual calendar each day to document menstrual symptoms 
(degree of bleeding, cramps, spotting, etc.).  
 
Calcium and Vitamin D Supplementation:  Participants will begin taking 800 IU of Vitamin D at the beginning of the 
baseline period.  Based on the estimate of daily calcium intake determined at screening using the Brief Calcium 
Assessment Tool (BCAT), subjects will be supplemented with calcium such that their daily intake approximates 1000 
mg (current recommended daily intake for this age group).  
 
6.2.3 Intervention: After baseline procedures are conducted, subjects will be randomly assigned to groups 
depending on whether they wished to be considered  for COC/TDC /CVR  therapy or not. After they are 
randomized, they will begin the Intervention on the first day of their next menstrual period. Thereafter, they 
will undergo [ADDRESS_370038] Study Period . 
 
Contraceptive Therapy Administration Plan for COC ,TDC, and CVR  Groups:   On the first day of the Intervention,  the 
participants randomized to the COC group will begin tak ing the COC pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382] ( Apri (or generic equivalent)) .  One pi[INVESTIGATOR_302955] , with the exception of one pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382] -free 
week . Each pi[INVESTIGATOR_302956] a total of [ADDRESS_370039] a pi[INVESTIGATOR_302957]  (30 μg EE and 150 μg desogestrel) from the second pack each 
day for days [ADDRESS_370040] pi[INVESTIGATOR_302958] (no inactive pi[INVESTIGATOR_302959] 2nd pack  in order to maintain concentrations of EE during the post -study testing), and will ingest a pi[INVESTIGATOR_302960] ( 30 μg EE and 150 μg desogestrel) from the third pack for days 50 -56.  Thus, a pi[INVESTIGATOR_302961] (30 μg EE and 150 μg desogestrel) will be ingested days 1 -21 and 29 -56 of the study period (including 
intervention and post -study period).  Participants in the TDC group will apply a 14 cm2 patch ( Xulane : 35µg/d 
EE,150µg/d norelgestromi n) to the abdomen, upper arm or buttock.  The patch will be changed once weekly on the 
same day each week for weeks 1 -3 (days 1 -21, removed on day 22 ) and weeks 5 -8 (days 29 -56).  Week 4 (days 22 -
28) will be a patch -free week.   Participants in the CVR  group will insert a vaginal ring into the vagina on Day 1 of the 
intervention .  The vaginal ring will be removed and discarded after 3 week s of continuous use (days 1 -21 of 
continuous use and removed on day 22 ).  There will be one week (days 22 -28) that will b e ring -free.  A new ring will 
be inserted for days [ADDRESS_370041] -study period (days  50-56).    
 
Body Weight/BMI:  Participants will be weighed weekly during the intervention to the nearest 0.01kg on a digital scale 
in the laboratory with a standard outfit of tee shirt and gym shorts. Body mass index (BMI) will be calculated from 
weight (k g) and height (m2) (height measured during screening).   
 
Monthly  Blood and Compliance Sample for SHBG:  In order to  test compliance with therapy  (COC/TDC/ CVR ) or no 
therapy (control group) , , a blood sample will be drawn once  during each of the 28 days of the Intervention for 
measurement of SHBG .  The blood draws will occur between days 10 -22 and between days 38 -50 of the Intervention 
period/Post Study period. Study participants will report to the lab between 7:00 and 10:00 AM in the fasted state and 
will b e asked to remain in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_19636] 15 minutes prior to the blood draw.   
 
 
Page 16 of 37 (V. 12/5/2013)   
Physical Activity:   Subjects will record any exercise they perform over 7 days using physical activity logs for one week 
during the intervention period.  Physical activity  will be quantified by [CONTACT_303018]/week, average MET level, mode, frequency, 
intensity, and total exercise volume. Subjects will be instructed to maintain their typi[INVESTIGATOR_302954].  
 
Menstrual Calendar and COC/TDC /CVR  Log Diary :   Subjec ts will complete a menstrual calendar and 
COC/TDC /CVR  log each day to document menstrual symptoms (degree of bleeding, cramps, spotting, etc.) and 
therapy use.  
 
Calcium and Vitamin D Supplementation: The supplementation as explained in the baseline phase will continue 
during the intervention.  
 
6.2.[ADDRESS_370042] -Study Period: Subjects will complete a 2-week  Post Study Period during which the study drug will 
be continued.  This phase of the study will begin between days [ADDRESS_370043] Study Period will begin between  days 2-7 of the 2nd menstrual cycle  during the 
intervention .   
 
Contraceptive Therapy Administration Plan for COC , TDC, and CVR  Groups:   Administration of contraceptive therapy 
will continue for the COC , TDC, and CVR  groups during the post -study period as described in the intervention 
section.  The COC group will continue to take active pi[INVESTIGATOR_302962]  (as described 
above) , the TDC group will continue to change the p atch weekly , and the CVR ring will remain inserted in the vagina 
for the CVR group  (but the ring will be replaced halfway through the post -study period) .  Administration of 
contraceptive therapy will be done when the post -study testing is complete.  Theref ore, if the post -study testing is 
completed a few days prior to day 56 of contraceptive therapy ( ~day [ADDRESS_370044] -study), then the subject will be 
instructed to discontinue contraceptive administration.  If the post -study testing is completed a few days aft er day 56 
of contraceptive therapy (day [ADDRESS_370045] -study) due to scheduling difficulties, the participants will be asked to 
continue taking contraceptive therapy as directed (following appropriate schedules for taking the pi[INVESTIGATOR_302963] ) until the post -study testing is complete.    
 
2-day Fasting  Blood Sampling to Establish Fasting Concentrations of GH/IGF -1 Axis  and Bone Metabolism :  During 
days [ADDRESS_370046]-study period  (days 15-17 of the second intervention  contraceptive  cycle /days  2-7 of the second 
intervention menstrual cycle ), blood will be obtained on 2 consecutive days for the IGF -1-related measures of  IGF-1, 
IGFBP -1, IGFBP -3, and ALS  and for markers of bone turnover .  Subjects will report to the CRC in the fasted state 
(no food for 8 hours prior  the appointment) in the morning on [ADDRESS_370047] :  To assess the impact of COC/T DC/CVR  therapy on responsiveness to GH, the IGF -[ADDRESS_370048] -study

Recombinant Human Growth Hormone : Omnitrope  is an FD A-approved human growth hormone that is 
prescribed to children or adolescents who have short stature  without definable cause  or are growing slowly 
due to various pathological conditions (inadequate GH production, Prader Willi Syndrome, Turner 
syndrome)  or idiopathic reasons.  It is also prescribed to adults with GH disorders .   
 
6.4.2  Treatment Regimen  
 
COC Therapy ( Apri or one of its generic equivalent s): 30µg/d ethinyl estradiol , 150 µg/d deso gestrel . 
The drug is administered orally during all days of the inter vention and post -study . Pi[INVESTIGATOR_302966] 
1-[ADDRESS_370058] study period (days 43 -56 when 
continuing from the intervention) will be active tablets containing [ADDRESS_370059] -study 
testing is complete, the ingestion of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_302967].   
 
TDC Therapy ( Xulane ): 35µg/d EE, 150µg/d norelgestromin  (entire 14 cm2 patch contains 0. 53 mg EE and 
4.86 mg norelgestromin which is delivered over the 7 days) .  The drug is a dministered transdermally for a 
total of ~ 56  days , with the exception of one patch -free week .  The patch is changed once per week  for 
weeks 1 -3 and weeks 5 -8 after baseline (during intervention and post -study).  Duration of administration 
may v ary slightly during the post -study period such that as soon as post -study testing is complete, usage of 
the patch will be discontinued.   
 
CVR Therapy (NuvaRing):  15µg/d EE, 120 µg/d etonogestrel  (rin contains 2.7 mg EE and 11.7 mg 
etonogestrel which is del ivered over 21 days ).  The drug is administered vaginally for ~[ADDRESS_370060] -study 
testing is complete .   
 
Recombinant human GH ( Omnitrope ): 0.033 mg/kg/d subcutaneously in the morning  for four days  during 
baseline and during post -study period (for a total of 8 days).   
 
   No dose adjustments will be made.   
6.4.[ADDRESS_370061] to Treatment Groups  
 
Simple random assignment using blocks of 3 according to preference for contraceptive  therapy  (COC or 
TDC or CVR ) will be used .  In other words, those interested in contraceptive therapy will be randomized 
 
Page 19 of 37 (V. 12/5/2013)  using blocks of [ADDRESS_370062] when they take their pi[INVESTIGATOR_302968] (for COC group) , when they change the patch each week (for TDC group) , or when they change the 
ring (for the CVR group)  on the contraceptive calendar that they are provided.  Subjects will also be asked 
to return pi[INVESTIGATOR_302969] (both used and unused).  Finally, each month during 
the intervention and post -study period s, a blood sample will be collected for determination of SHBG  
concentrations.   
 
Compliance to GH administration will be assessed via the growth hormone log on which the subjects will be 
asked to record the time of day corresponding to the appropriate date s that the growth hormone   was 
injected .  Because this procedure will be completed in the CRC, the nurses and study personnel will also 
have documentation that the injections were completed.

6.4.6  Receiving, Storage, Dispensing and Return  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Receipt of Test Article  
 
The contraceptives, Apri (or one of its generic equivalent s), Xulane , and NuvaRing , will be 
purchased from a pharmacy and the labeling will be as follows:  
 
Apri Packaging:   From the packaging:  “Apri 28 Day Regimen blister cards for 
desogestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets provide an oral  contraceptive regimen of 21 
round rose -colored tablets. Each rose -colored “active” desogestrel and  ethinyl estradiol 
tablet for oral administration contains 0.15 mg desogestrel (13 -ethyl-11- methylene -18,19 -
dinor -17 alpha -pregn -4-en- 20-yn-17-ol) and 0.03 mg ethinyl estradiol (19 -nor-17 alpha -
pregna -1,3,5 (10) -trien-20-yne-3,17-diol). Inactive ingredients include colloidal silicon 
dioxide, FD&C Blue  No. 2 Aluminum Lake, FD&C Red No. 40 Aluminum Lake, 
hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, lactose  monohydrate, polyethylene glycol, polysorbate 80, 
povidone, pregelatinized starch, stearic acid,  titanium dioxide, and vitamin E.  Apri 28 Day 
Regimen blister cards also contain 7 white “inactive” tablets for oral administration,  
containing the following inactive ingredients: lactose anhydrous, magnesium stearate,  
microcrystallinecellulose and pregelatinized starch. ”  
 
For the purposes of this study,  each subject will receive three  pi[INVESTIGATOR_302970] . The subjects will 
be instructed to take one pi[INVESTIGATOR_302971] 1 -56 (including the 
[ADDRESS_370064] -study period).  COC administration will end when the post -study testing is 
complete (may be a few days before or after day [ADDRESS_370065] -study period (day 56 when 
continuing from intervention).  The first pi[INVESTIGATOR_302972] 24 hours of her 
menstrual period (day 1).  
Xulane  Packaging:  The patch has  a contact [CONTACT_303019] 14 cm2, contains 4.86 mg 
norelgestromin and 0. 53 mg ethinyl estradiol released over 7 days, or 
(0.035mg/0.15mg)/24 hours.   
 
Page 20 of 37 (V. 12/5/2013)  The patch itself is a thin, matrix -type transdermal contraceptive patch consisting of three 
layers. The backing laye r is composed of a peach  flexible film consisting of a pi[INVESTIGATOR_302973] a polyester inner layer. It provides structural support and 
protects the middle adhesive layer from the environment. The middle layer  contains 
polyisobutylene/polybutene adhesive, crospovidone,  mineral oil,  non-woven polyester 
fabric , oleyl alcohol  and dipropylene glycol  as inactive components. The active 
components in this layer are the hormones, norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol . The third 
layer is the release liner , which protects the adhesive layer during storage and is removed 
just prior to application. It is a transparent polyester  film with a fluoropolymer  coating on 
the s ide that is in contact [CONTACT_303020].  
The Xulane  transdermal system uses a 28 -day (four -week) cycle. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], a  new patch 
is applied each week for three weeks (21 total days). Week Four is patch -free. For the 
purposes of this study, the week four will be a patch -free week as is typi[INVESTIGATOR_302974].  However, after this patch -free week, a new patch will be 
administered each week for the next 4 weeks (weeks 5 -8).  If necessary, a new patch will 
be administered on day [ADDRESS_370066] -study testing at which time it 
can be removed.  Every new patch will be applied on the same day of the week. This day 
is known as the "Patch Change Day." For example, if the first patch is applied on a 
Monday, all subsequent patches should be applied on a Monday. Only one patch will be 
worn at a time.  Subjects will be instructed not to cut, damage or alter the Xulane  patch in 
any way. The woman will be instructed to apply  her first patch during the first 24 hours of 
her menstrual period (day 1).  
NuvaRing Packaging: NuvaRing (etonogestrel/ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring) is a non -
biodegradable, flexible, transparent,  colorless to almost colorless, combination 
contraceptive vaginal ring conta ining two active components, a  progestin, etonogestrel 
(13-ethyl -17-hydroxy -11-methylene -18,19 -dinor -17α-pregn -4-en-20-yn-3-one) and  an 
estrogen, ethinyl estradiol (19 -nor-17α-pregna -1,3,5(10) -trien-20-yne-3,17-diol). When 
placed in the  vagina, each ring releases on average 0.120 mg/day  of etonogestrel and 
0.015 mg/day of ethinyl  estradiol over a three -week period of use. NuvaRing is made of 
ethylene vinylacetate copolymers (28%  and 9% vinylacetate) and magnesium stearate 
and contains 11.[ADDRESS_370067] 24 hours of her menstrual period (day 1)  at 
the start of the intervention.  The ring will be in place continuously for 3 weeks and will be 
removed on day 22, after 21 days of continuous use .  Day 22 -28 will be a ring -free week.  
A second ring will be used for days 29 -49 (removed on day 50 after 21 days of continuous 
use), and  a third ring will be used for  the remainder of the study (day [ADDRESS_370068]-study period).     
Recombinant Human GH ( rhGH, Omnitrope ) will be purchased from a pharmacy .  It is a 
somatropin (rDNA origin) injection.  We will be using 5.8 mg vials of Omnitrope.  The vials contain 
a lypholized powder which is reconsti tuted with bacteriostatic water (contains benzyl alcohol as a 
preservative).   
The lypholized powder will be reconstituted with the bacteriostatic water by [CONTACT_303021].  
The Omnitrope  vial with the diluent can be stored for [ADDRESS_370069]’s body weight, which will 
be supplied to the CRC.   
 
Page 21 of 37 (V. 12/5/2013)   
For each resea rch participant, nurses in the CRC will inject the human GH subcutaneously each 
morning for [ADDRESS_370070]’s body weight will be explici tly provided to 
the CRC .   
 
GH Administration will follow the directions clearly outlined in the Instructions for Use (see attached 
supplementary information  in the drugs section of the application on CATS ).

their protective pouches.  The subjects will be instructed to fold the sticky sides of the used 
patch together and put back in the protective pouch to be returned to the study group.  
 
The pouches containing the NuvaRing will be stored in  a research -designated, locked 
refrigerator (2 -8 degrees Celsius) in the CRC.  After being dispensed to the subjects, the 
NuvaRing can be stored at room temperature (25 degrees Celsius).  The subjects will be 
instructed to keep the pouch with the ring out of direct sunlight and temperatures exceeding 
30 degrees Celsius.   
 
The rhGH ( Omnitrope ) will be stored protected from light in a research -designated locked 
refrigerator in the CRC at a temperature of 2 to 8 degrees Celsius.  This locked refrigerator is 
only used for study drugs and the temperature is monitored daily.   The powder form will be

a block of [ADDRESS_370071] will be 
supplied with three  oral pi[INVESTIGATOR_302976] , seven or eight  transdermal patches  (more will be 
provided as necessary if  a patch falls off during the week), or three  vaginal ring pouches .   
Once assigned to the study group, a CRC nursing staff member and a researc h WHEL staff 
member will dispense the study drug  to the subject  and provide detailed instructions 
regarding how to take the study drug .  
For the rhGH, nurses in the CRC will reconstitute the Omnitrope vial of powder using a vial of 
diluent (bacteriostatic water with benzyl alcohol).  T he appropriate dose for each subject will 
be calculated by [CONTACT_303022] f (0.033 mg/kg/d).  Uploaded on the CATS 
system is a detailed instruction sheet from the manufacturer on how to prepare and 
administer the drug.   The injections will be given by [CONTACT_303023].   
 
In addition to detailed instructions from the study team, subjects will receive the patient 
information for each drug (when available) describing how to take the drug.

8.0 Statistical Plan  
 
8.1 Sample size determination  
 
Because this is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_302977] R01 proposal, we aim to complete 12 
subjects in each of 4 groups (COC group, TDC group, CVR  group, and control), totaling [ADDRESS_370073] 
over 28 days in the groups receiving TDC vs. COC. A total of 12 participants (6 each in the COC and TDC estradiol 
arms) will be required to detect a difference of 1.348*SD in mean change in IGF -1 lev els in groups receiving TDC vs. 
COC, with a power of 86%, using a two sided p=0.[ADDRESS_370074] (Weissberger et al., 1991).    Because we are adding a 
group and to ensure that we see a difference among the groups, we aim to complete 12 subjects per group.   
 
To account for a potential screening failure rate of 33% and potential drop -out rate after randomization of 30%, we 
plan to enroll a total of 100 subjects ( 25 per group).  
 
8.[ADDRESS_370075] analysis of variance (ANOVA).  For 
longitudinal analyses, repeated measures ANOVA as well as mixed linear models will be used to determine if 
response of the GH/IGF -1 axis to 1) route of administration of contraceptive therapy and 2) exogenous GH d iffers 
among groups before and after contraceptive therapy.

11.0 Risks  
 
COC Therapy (for COC group):   There are  several rare  risks associated with using birth control pi[INVESTIGATOR_302979], but not limited 
to, blood clots, heart attack, st roke, bleeding in the brain, gall bladder disease, formation of liver tumors, breast cancer, high 
 
Page 26 of 37 (V. 12/5/2013)  blood pressure, vision problems, and  unfavorable cholesterol levels . It is unlikely that a complication will occur because the 
risk of serious disease or death is very small in healthy women without underlying risk factors .  Further, we are excluding 
women who have contraindications to COC t herapy (i.e., smokers; women with a history of blood clots, heart disease, or 
stroke; women with hypertension, liver or gallbladder disease, cancer, or diabetes; women who have recently had major 
surgery with prolonged immobilization; women who are breastf eeding or recently postpartum).  Additionally, symptoms such 
as nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps and bloating, breakthrough bleeding, migraine headaches, breast tenderness, edema 
(swelling), melasma (spotty darkening of skin), yellowing of the skin, weig ht and appetite changes, rash, intolerance to contact 
[CONTACT_13276], depression and/or anxiety, loss of scalp hair, and vaginal infections  may be associated with taking the birth control 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353]. In general, the most common complaint while taking birth control pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382] s is breakthrough  bleeding.  Because this study is a 
short duration (6 weeks), this will resolve quickly after study completion.   
 
 
TDC Therapy (for TDC group ):  Potential  side effects of TDC use include  nausea, breast discomfort, headache, skin irritatio n, 
breakthrough bleeding, edema, melasma (spotty darkening of skin), dizziness, and gastrointestinal problems.  In the case of 
skin irritation, the patch may be removed and moved to a different location to reduce irritation.  For other side effects, th e 
subjects will be referred to a physician in the CRC or will be encouraged to contact [CONTACT_303026].  Serious 
risks associated with TDC therapy include blood clots, heart attack, stroke, and gallbladder disease. In rare cases, liver tu mors 
or cancer of the reproductive organs/breasts may occur.  However, these risks will be minimized by [CONTACT_303027] (for example: smokers; women with a history of blood clots, 
heart diseas e, or stroke; women with hypertension, liver or gallbladder disease, cancer, or diabetes; women who have 
recently had major surgery with prolonged immobilization; women who are breastfeeding or recently postpartum).   
 
For a detailed list of the risks/side  effects associated with TDC ( Xulane ), please consult the following website:  
http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=f784 8550 -086a -43d8 -8ae5 -047f4b9e4382   
 
CVR Therapy (for CVR group):   Potential common side effects of CVR  include vaginitis, headaches, moo d changes, device -
related events (expulsion/discomfo rt/foreign body sensation), nausea and vomiting, vaginal discharge, increased body weight, 
vaginal discomfort, breast pain or tenderness, dysme norrhea, abdominal pain, acne, decreased libido , and chloasma .  Serious 
risks associated with CVR  use are deep ve in thrombosis, anxie ty, cholelithiasis, vomiting, strokes and myocardial infarction, 
toxic shock syndrome, impaired liver function and liver tumors, increased blood pressure, and gallbladder disease.  These 
risks will be minimized by [CONTACT_303028].  
 
Resting Blood Samples:   The risks associated with single blood samples obtained with a needle and syringe or intravenous 
catheter may include one or all of the following : local discomfort, occasional dizziness and nausea, and black and blue marks.  
Blood clots attached to the walls of a blood vessel, and infections are very rare but are also potential risks.  These risks will be 
minimized or eliminated by [CONTACT_303029].  A trained assistant will 
closely monitor the subject  while blood is being obtained in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_84740].   
 
Subcutaneous GH administration:  Growth hormone can sometimes cause side effects. The study p articipant may immediately 
experience pain, bleeding or swelling at the site of the injection. Other side effects may develop more slowly.  Common side 
effects or most frequently observed adverse reactions include 1) swelling of the hands and feet, 2) carp al tunnel syndrome, 3) 
joint and back pain, 4) burning or tingling of the skin, 5) stuffy nose,  6) headaches , and 7) temporary high blood sugar (if the 
subject did not  have high blood sugar  when she started taking the study drug, then this condition shoul d go away when the 
injections are stopped) .  Uncommon but potentially severe side effects include 1) high blood pressure, 2) pain and burning at 
the site of injection, 3) increased liver enzymes, 4) a dimple at the site of injection ( this may happen if the  study drug is always 
injected in the same place; to prevent this, the place where the injection is performed should be changed often), 5 previously 
present nevi (black birth marks) may increase in size (rare), 6) allergic reactions to a chemical called  m-cresol, which is part of 
the study drug injection, 7) feeling tired or cold due to production of less thyroid hormone , resulting in puffy boggy swelling 
around the eyes, on the backs of the hands and feet, above the collarbone, 8) increase in pressure insi de the brain causing 
severe headache (rarely occurs and should go away if the study drug dose is lowered or stopped) , 9) diabetic retinopathy, 10) 
pancreatitis .  Most of these symptoms disappear by [CONTACT_303030] a period of time or with a decrease in do sage or stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_302980]. If symptoms do not go away, then the subject will need to stop taking the study drug.   A higher risk for leukemia (a 
type of blood cancer) from growth hormone was noted in one small study. However experts now agree that the ri sk for 
 
Page 27 of 37 (V. 12/5/2013)  leukemia in people receiving growth hormone is not greater than that for anybody else.   Lastly, giving growth hormone in 
pregnancy can be harmful to the unborn baby; however, we will do a pregnancy test during baseline to ensure that the subject 
is not pregnant.   
 
Overnight Fast:  After the overnight fast , subjects  may feel faint or dizzy. They are encouraged to  drink water the morning of 
the blood draw  and will be provided with a snack after all blood draws required for the study visit are complete d.   
 
Blood Loss :  There may be a risk of reduced amount of blood (plasma volume), red blood cell count or the amount of iron -
containing substances that carry oxygen on red blood cells (hemoglobin levels) as a result of the blood lost over the course of 
the study.  To minimize risks, we intend to screen individuals who may have low levels of hemoglobin and hematocrit.  If these 
parameters are out of the normal range during the screening tests, these volunteers may be discontinued from the study  or be 
requir ed to wait several weeks prior to beginning the study after it has been determined that hemoglobin and hematocrit are in 
the normal range .   
 
DXA Body Composition Assessment:  The Dual Energy X -ray Absorptiometry (DXA) body composition procedure exposes an 
individual to a small amount of radiation where the X -ray beam crosses the body.  This protocol calls for one total body scan.  
On occasion a scan may need to be repeated for quality control purposes. This radiation exposure is not necessary for 
medical ca re and is for research purposes only.  There is minimal risk from this exposure.   To ensure that a fetus is not 
exposed to radiation, a urinary pregnancy test will be conducted prior to the DXA scan.   
 
Urine Sample for Pregnancy Tests :  There are no known  risks associated with the self -collection of one’s urine .  Volunteers 
will be given screw top and airtight containers to collect the urine.   
 
Exercise Testing (VO2max):  During exercise testing, volunteers may occasionally experience lightheadedness, ches t 
discomfort, and crampi[INVESTIGATOR_302981].  Irregular heart beats and irregular blood pressure responses may occur.  The risk of 
death during an exercise test is minor (0.5 per 10,000 tests), but does exist. These risks are usually found in individuals w ith 
existing heart conditions.  Other potential risks, including fainting, nausea, muscle strain, and muscle soreness, will be 
minimized by [CONTACT_303031] -up procedures. Proper procedures for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_302982] a participant have 
abnormal s ymptoms associated with this test.  Should an emergency situation occur, research personnel will call 911.  During 
the exercise test, heart rate will be monitored continuously via a Polar heart rate monitor and rating of perceived exertion 
(RPE) ; blood pre ssure will be monitored before and after the test.  Expi[INVESTIGATOR_302983], which is a marker of aerobic fitness.  A medical history will be obtained in order to 
identify absolute and  relative contraindications to exercise testing. Trained personnel will administer the exercise tests and 
follow the proper procedures according to the guidelines of the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM).  
 
Physical Activity Assessments :   There a re no known risks associated with the collection of information about one’s exercise 
practices.  
 
Additional Costs Associated with Participation in Study:  Study participants  may spend additional money (that is not included 
in the compensation) on transport ation to and from the laboratory . 
 
Inconveniences:  The following aspects of the study may represent inconveniences: frequent lab visits,  fasting prior to and 
during blood sampling , repeated blood sampling , long study visits, two 4 -day periods of subcutaneo us injections, pregnancy 
tests, daily food logs, daily activity logs, daily menstrual logs, questionnaires, tests which are physically invasive and in volve 
wearing cumbersome equipment .  
 
 
12.0 Potential Benefits to Subjects and Others  
 
12.1 Potential Benefits to Su bjects  
 
Individual subjects will receive the results and explanation of results of certain procedures completed, to include 1) 
body composition measurements, 2) maximal oxygen consumption measurement as an indicator of aerobic fitness, 
 
Page 28 of 37 (V. 12/5/2013)  and 3) serum concent ration values of selected hormones.  This information will provide the subjects with valuable 
information about their health and fitness.   
 
In addition, the study will provide individual subjects with exposure to different types of hormonal contraceptive 
therapy which may be informative to them if they are eventually seeking to begin hormonal contraception.   
 
12.2 Potential Benefits to Others  
 
The benefits to society include increasing  our knowledge of how hormonal contraceptive therapy, in particular oral , 
transdermal , and vaginal  contraceptive therapy, affects bone health of young, exercising women via its effects on the 
GH/IGF -1 axis.  This study will also help us determine whether or not a newer, alternative form of hormonal 
contraceptive therapy, i.e., tra nsdermal or vaginal contraceptive therapy, may preserve bone health among young, 
exercising women by [CONTACT_303032]/IGF -1 axis.   Osteoporosis is a major concern for women later in life , and 
hormonal contraceptive therapy, especially oral contracept ive therapy, is extremely common among young women.  
As such, this study may help to provide valuable information about the safety profile of three  forms of hormonal 
contraceptive therapy  in terms of the GH/IGF -1 axis and bone health.  
 
13.0 Sharing Results wit h Subjects  
 
Study participants will receive their DXA scan and body composition information, results from the screening blood draw 
(complete b lood count and chemistry panel and selected endocrine hormone concentrat ions), and their maximal oxygen 
consumptio n value.   
 
Study results will not be shared with members outside the study team, including physicians.  If the study participant wishes to 
share her results with her physician, we will give her the results to share with her physician but we will not direc tly provide the 
physician with the results.   
 
14.0 Economic Burden to Subjects  
 
14.1 Costs  
 
Study participants may spend additional money on transportation to and from the laboratory; otherwise, there are no 
additional costs related to study participation .  There is the possibility that study participants may have to pay for all 
or part of the cost of a pap smear to be eli gible for the study, depending o n their health insurance.    
 
14.2 Compensation for research -related injury  
 
Compensation is not available for researc h-related injury.   
 
It is the policy of the institution to provide neither financial compensation nor free medical treatment for research -
related injury. In the event of injury resulting from this research, medical treatment is available but will be provi ded at 
the usual charge. Costs for the treatment of research -related injuries will be charged to subjects or their insurance 
carriers.  
 
 
15.0 Number of Subjects  
 
Because this is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_302984] R01 proposal, we  aim to complete 12 subjects 
in each of 4 groups (COC group, TDC group, CVR group, and control), totaling 48 subjects.  
 
To account for a potential screening failure rate of 33% and potential drop -out rate after randomization of 30%, we plan to 
enroll a to tal of 100 subjects ( 25 per group).  
 
 
Page 29 of 37 (V. 12/5/2013)  16.0 Resources Available  
 
16.1 Facilities and locations  
 
Recruitment will occur on the Penn State University Park campus and in the surrounding State College community.  
Study procedures will be completed on the Penn State Univer sity Park campus in Noll Laboratory in the Women’s 
Health and Exercise Laboratory and the Clinical Research Center.   
 
The Women’s Health and Exercise Laboratory (WHEL), co -directed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Nancy I. Williams and [CONTACT_303040], is located in the Dep artment of Kinesiology at the Penn State University Park campus in the Noll Laboratory

sq.ft. continuous expansion with the existing Noll Physiological Resear ch Center building. It is the University Park 
satellite site of the Penn State General Clinical Research Center.  The CRC provides staff and a variety of services 
including but not limited to:  planning meetings with investigators to facilitate inclusion o f desired ancillary testing, 
nursing interventions and documentation, medication administration, blood sampling via venipuncture or vascular 
access devices, anthropometric measurements, metabolic testing (resting metabolic rate) and pulmonary function 
testing, insertion and maintenance of intravenous access, exercise stress testing (treadmill) , and bone densitometry 
and body composition testing (DXA).  
 
Page 30 of 37 (V. 12/5/2013)   
The CRC Nursing Department is on the second floor of the Elmore Clinical Research Wing and includes the fo llowing 
facilities: A nurse’s station with clinical records files and clinician office.  The following nursing depar tment facilities 
are shared by [CONTACT_303033]: exam room and two invasive procedure ro oms, procedure room for testing  exercise 
and pulmon ary function, small specimen processing room with refrigerated and unrefrigerated centrifuges, five 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] -style bedrooms with bathrooms, and overnight beds.  
 
16.2 Feasibility of recruiting the required number of subjects  
 
We are recruiting women between the ages of 18 -30 years.  This age range encompasses both undergraduate and 
graduate students.  The student body at PSU University Park is comprised of approximately 46,184 students which 
includes approximately 35,000 undergraduate students and 10,000 graduate  students.   
 
http://admissions.psu.edu/pennstate/campuses/?campusCode=UP  
 
Among undergraduate students, 54% of the student body is men and 46% is women.  If we are just considerin g 
undergraduate students, we would ideally have access to 16,100 potential subjects.  The number that we need to 
recruit for this small pi[INVESTIGATOR_302986] 0. 6% of the ideal number of potential subjects.   
 
http://admissions.psu.edu/apply/statistics/  
 
Of course, we have additional inclusion/exclusion criteria so the potential number of subjects that we have access to 
is smaller than that listed above.  However, because we are conducting a small pi[INVESTIGATOR_302987] a large university 
campus where almost half of t he student population is female and within the desired age range, it is very feasible to 
recruit the required number of subjects for this study.   
 
16.3 PI [INVESTIGATOR_302988] (and continues to conduct) man y research studies to include a large randomized 
controlled trial.   Recruitment has ended, however, for the large RCT, and one small study underway in the Fall 
Semester [ADDRESS_370079] 3 full -time graduate students – two of whom are experienced 
with conducting research studies in the lab.  There is also the potential for 2 more graduate students to be joining the 
lab in Fall 2014.  There are also 2 full -time postdoctoral scholars in the lab, and 1 full -time laboratory technician.  
These members of the lab in addition to the several undergraduate students who volunteer in the lab will help to 
ensure that the research is co mpleted.  
 
16.4 Availability of medical or psychological resources  
 
On the University Park campus, medical resources are available at University Health Services and psychological 
resources are available at CAPS (Counseling and Psychological Services).  Within N oll Laboratory where all study 
procedures will occur there is also a Clinical Research Center with onsite nurses and physicians if needed.   
 
16.5 Process for informing Study Team  
 
The Women’s Health and Exercise Lab has weekly lab meetings that are conducted b y the lab supervisor (and 
principal investigator).  All graduate students, postdocs, lab techs, project coordinators, and honors undergraduate 
students who are part of the study team and work in the lab are required to attend the meetings.  Discussion abou t 
the protocol and study duties will occur at these meetings.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_302989].   
 
Appropriate training of study team members according to their assigned duties will occur prior to solo execution of t he 
study procedures by [CONTACT_38991].

Not applicable.  
 
19.5 Audit and Monitoring Plans  
Not applicable.  
 
 
20.0 Adverse Event Reporting  
20.1 Advers e Event Definitions  
 
For drug studies, incorporate the following definitions into the below responses, 
as written:  
Adverse event  Any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of the drug in humans, 
whether or not considered drug related  
Adverse  reaction  Any adverse event caused by a drug  
Suspected 
adverse reaction  Any adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused 
the adverse event.  Suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of 
certainty about causality than “adverse reaction”.  
 Reasonable possibility.   For the purpose of IND safety reporting, 
“reasonable possibility” means there is evidence to suggest a causal 
relationship between the drug and the adverse event.  
Serious adverse 
event or Serious Serious adverse event or Serious suspected adverse reaction: An adverse event 
or suspected adverse reaction that in the view of either the investigator or 
 
Page 32 of 37 (V. 12/5/2013)  suspected  
adverse reaction  sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: Death, a life -threatening 
adverse event, inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], 
a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect. Important 
medical eve nts that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or 
surgical intervention to preven t one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  
Life-threatening 
adverse event or 
life-threatening 
suspected 
adverse reaction  An adverse event or  suspected adverse reaction is considered “life -threatening” if, 
in the view of either the Investigator (i.e ., the study site principal investigator) or 
Sponsor, its occurrence places the patient or research subject at immediate risk of 
death.  It does not include a n adverse event or  suspected adverse reaction that 
had it occurred in a more severe form, might ha ve caused death.  
Unexpected 
adverse event or 
Unexpected 
suspected 
adverse reaction.   An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “unexpected” if it is 
not listed in the  investigator brochure,  general investigational plan, clinical 
protoc ol, or elsewhere in the current IND application; or is not listed at the 
specificity or severity that has been previously observed and/or specified.  
 
  
 
For device studies, incorporate the following definitions  into the below 
responses,  as written:  
Unant icipated 
adverse device 
effect  Any serious adverse effect on health or safety or any life -threatening problem or 
death caused by, or associated with, a device, if that effect, problem, or death was 
not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree o f incidence in the 
investigational plan or IDE application (including a supplementary plan or 
application), or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device 
that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects.  
 
20.2 Recording of Adver se Events  
 
During study, participants will be routinely questioned about how they are feeling, particularly after initiating 
administration of a drug.  In addition, when the drug is dispensed, study participants will be instructed to inform the 
study team if they do not feel well after initiating the study drug or if they experience any of the side effects/risks that 
may be associated with taking the drugs.  
 
All adverse events (serious or non -serious) and abnormal test findings observed or reported to study  team  believed 
to be associated with the study drug(s) or device(s) will be followed until the event (or its sequelae) or the abnormal 
test finding resolves or stabilizes at a level acceptable to the investigator.  
 
An abnormal test finding will be classifi ed as an adverse event if one or more of the following criteria are met:  
 The test finding is accompanied by [CONTACT_4659]  
 The test finding necessitates additional diagnostic evaluation(s) or medical/surgical intervention; including 
significant addition al concomitant drug treatment or other therapy  
Note:  Simply repeating a test finding, in the absence of any of the other listed criteria, does not constitute an 
adverse event.   
 The test finding leads to a change in study drug dosing or discontinuation of subject participation in the clinical 
research study  
 The test finding is considered an adverse event by [CONTACT_093].  
20.[ADDRESS_370082] findings to dete rmine 1) if the 
abnormal test finding should be classified as an adverse event; 2) if there is a reasonable possibility that the adverse 
 
Page 33 of 37 (V. 12/5/2013)  event was caused by [CONTACT_5257](s) or device(s); and 3) if the adverse event meets the criteria for a serious 
advers e event . 
 
If the investigator’s final determination of causality is “unknown and of questionable relationship to the study drug(s) 
or device(s)”, the adverse event will be classified as associated with the use of the study drug(s) or device(s)  for 
reportin g purposes.  If the investigator’s final determination of causality is “unknown but not related to the study 
drug(s) or device(s)”, this determination and the rationale for the determination will be documented in the respective 
subject’s case history.  
 
20.4 Reporting of A dvers e Reactions  and Unanticipated Problems  to the FDA   
20.4.1  Written IND Safety Reports  
 
Not applicable.  All study drugs are FDA -approved.   
20.4.2  Telephoned IND Safety Reports – Fatal or Life -threatening Suspected Adverse 
Reactions  
 
Not applicable.  All  study drugs are FDA -approved  
20.[ADDRESS_370083] (IRB), the 
investigator will report, to the IRB, any observed or reported harm (adverse event) experienced by a subject or other 
individual, which in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_40454] (1) unexpected; and (2) probably related to the 
research procedures. Harms (adverse events) will b e submitted to the IRB in accordance with the IRB policies and 
procedures.  
20.6 Unblinding Procedures  
 
Not applicable.  This study is not blinded.  
20.7 Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_302990]; therefore, it is unlikely that the entire  study would need to be 
interrupted or stopped.   
 
In the event that multiple subjects report adverse events or adverse reactions during the study, the study team and 
clinical staff will consult together to determine if the adverse events that have occurre d warrant interruption of the 
study.   
 
21.0 Study Monitoring, Auditing and Inspecting  
21.1 Study Monitoring Plan    
21.1.1  Quality Assurance and Quality Control  
    
It is currently unclear if FDA regulations apply to this study; however, the principal investigator, [CONTACT_303041], will monitor the conduct of the study via regular meetings with study team members who will be 
collecting the data.  Also, a project coordinator will be designated to ensure that the data are collected, 
recorded, and stored in a manner that is in co mpliance with the protocol and appropriate policies.  
 
Page 34 of 37 (V. 12/5/2013)   
Also, [CONTACT_303042] from the CRC will be the Medical Monitor and will assess any adverse events that 
may arise.   
21.1.2  Safety Monitoring  
 
 If an event occurs to a study participant that is determined to  fit the criteria of a reportable adverse event, 
adverse reaction, etc. (at the discretion of the principal investigator), a description of the adverse event will 
be written and the adverse event will be reported to the IRB following IRB guidelines for “re portable new 
information.”   
 
 
The Principal Investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_74160] (AE) are correctly entered into the AE case 
report forms  by [CONTACT_14676]; be available to answer any questions that the coordinators may have 
concerning AEs;  and will  notify the IRB, FDA , sponsor  and/or DSMB of all applicable  AEs as appropriate. 
All assessments of AEs will be made by a licensed medical professional , [CONTACT_303039] or [CONTACT_303043],  who are investigator s on the research.  
 
The research  coordinator  (with the help of the study team member who may have observed or first heard 
about the adverse event (if applicable)) will complete the appropriate report form and logs; assist the PI [INVESTIGATOR_302991], FDA, and/or DSMB of all Unanticipated Problems/SAE’s.  
 
The Monitor  will confirm that the AEs are correctly entered into the case report forms . The Monitor will 
confirm that the adverse events are consistent with the source documents and are reported to the 
appropriate regulat ory bodies, as required.  
21.2 Auditing and Inspecting  
The investigator will permit study -related monitoring, audits, and inspections by [CONTACT_303034](s), IRB, the sponsor, and government regulatory bodies, of all study related documents (e.g. source 
documents, regulatory documents, data collection instruments, study data etc.).  The investigator will ensure the 
capability for inspections of applicable study -related facilities (e.g. pharmacy, diagnostic laboratory, etc.).

million adults were living with diabetes in 2015 and this number is expected to rise to 33 
642 million (or 1 adult in 10) by 2040 (1).  This makes it likely that a good proportion of [ADDRESS_1010079] an aircraft each day ( www.iata.org ) are flying with an [ADDRESS_1010080] a quarter will be using insulin on a daily basis (2).  38

For insulin treated individuals planning long- haul travel  (defined as a flight lastin g more 40 
than 6hours) , consideration needs to be given to every stage of a journey from deciding [ADDRESS_1010081] of crossing multiple times zones and jet lag on 45 
insulin action and the perception of low blood glucose levels at  altitude ( 3). O nce a [ADDRESS_1010082] or stolen , as well as dealing with unfamiliar foods, 48 
unaccustomed exercise, or even riding roller coasters ( 4). In one survey more than half of 49 
travelers with diabetes reported difficulties in glucose management during their journey 50 
compared to the month prior to leaving ( 5). In general, for insulin- treated individuals 51 
around 10% of travelers on short as well as long- haul journeys experienced problems, [ADDRESS_1010083] 24 hours after arriving at 53 
their destination ( 6). For long- haul travel in particular, there is evidence that most [ADDRESS_1010084] insulin doses 55 
for patients who travel across several time zones and some of the information provided is 56 
described as “potentially harmful” ( 7). Furthermore , recent testimony from on- line 57 
bloggers and patient forums continues to highlight specific problems related to diabetes 58 
and travel ( 8). 59 
 60 
We sought to determine the real -life experiences of individuals traveling long distance 61 
(across five or more  time-zones ) with type 1 diabetes (T1D). M embers of the T1D 62 
Exchange  (n=503)  online community (www.myglu.org) completed a 45- question survey 63 
about their travel experiences flying long distance  (9). The cohort was stratified by 64 
duration of T1D and whether or not parti cipants used continuous subcutaneous insulin 65 
infusion (CSII) therapy  and/or a continuous glucose monitor (CGM). In the last 5 years, 66 
71% of participants  had flown long distance. When asked about their perceived ‘‘fear of 67 
flying,’’ CSII users (with and without a CGM) reported their primary anxiety was 68 
‘‘losing supplies,’’ while non- CSII users described concerns over ‘‘unstable blood 69 
glucose (highs and lows)’’ (P < 0.05). In addition, 74% of participants reported more 70 
hypoglycemia  and/or hyperglycemia while t raveling overseas and 9% had avoided 71 
international travel altogether  because of problems related to diabetes management. 72 
Furthermore, 22% of participants had run out of  insulin at some point during a trip and 73 
37% reported inadequate attention in current sources of information to the 74 
unpredictability of self -management needs while traveling. Especially problematic for 75 
Version 2.0, January 18, 2019   3 
 individuals traveling with T1D are a lack of resources adequately addressing : (a) [ADDRESS_1010085], ( b) how to navigate airport security, and ( c) 77 
managing basal insulin rates when crossing time zones. A strong need exists for easily 78 
accessible, free resources for traveli ng with T1D that is tailored to both device use and 79 
duration of the disease   80 
 81 
Currently, there is a lack of patient -centered research evaluating the practical and 82 
psychosocial aspects of travel and T1D. F ew resources offer practical and easy to 83 
understand travel guidance to individuals with T1D. Available sources of information 84 
include publications targeting physicians and scientific researchers, online articles 85 
providing generalized tips (transportation and storage of supplies, suggested 86 
immunizations, diet regimens to follow, optimizing insulin dose modification across time 87 
zones) and free electronic dosage calculators (10-14). For the most part these articles are 88 
well written and offer sound counsel, but many guidelines are overly complicated with 89 
medical jargon and complex tables describing insulin dosing adjustments . This pos es a 90 
problem for both patients and providers looking for simple travel advice ( 15). Diabetes [ADDRESS_1010086] 1 in every 614 flights (16). [ADDRESS_1010087] also offered a “travel calculator” to provide guidance on planning changes in the [ADDRESS_1010088] logged on with 52% 98

RATIONALE  FOR THE STUDY 104 
 105 
The purpose of the proposed study is to compare insulin Degludec U100 with insulin 106 
Glargine U100 to determine the basal insulin of choice for adults with type 1 diabetes 107 
who fly non- stop across multiple time zones . With the introduction of Degludec as basal 108 
insulin for T1D and the opportunity to vary time of injection between 8 and 40 hours, the 109 
use of Degludec as a basal insulin may make it easier for both people living with T1D 110 
and diabetologists to plan long- haul travel compared to the us e of existing basal insulins 111 
when crossing multiple time zones  (insulin degludec injection) ( Label – FDA  112 
https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2016/203314s003lbl.pdf .  113

SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES  117 
 118 
To compare glycemic control end points between Deglude c U100 versus Glargine U100 119 
as the basal i nsulin in a pi[INVESTIGATOR_739104] 1 diabetes who are established on 120 
multiple daily injections  (MDI)  of insulin and flying long- haul.   121 
Version 2.0, January 18, 2019   4 
 RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS  122 
Study Hypothesis : Once daily Degludec U100 as the basal insulin will provide better 123 
glycemic  control for people with type 1 diabetes on multiple daily injections  who are 124 
traveling non- stop across multiple time zones  than once daily Glargine U100.   125 
 126 
Endpoints : 127 
The P rimary endpoint  will be , using continuous interstitial glucose monitoring (CGM), 128 
achieved glycemic control defined as time in range ( 70-140 mg/dl ) during the initial 24 129 
hours  local time  (starting within 2 hours after arrivin g) in Newark, NJ  or JFK, NY after [ADDRESS_1010089] (from Honolulu, HI ) and after the return journey from 131 
New ark to Honolulu (flying East to West) comparing Glargine U100 versus 132 
DegludecU100 as the basal insulin.   133 
 134 
Participants will begin in Honolulu, HI (HNL) , fly to Newark (EWR ) or [LOCATION_001] (JFK) [ADDRESS_1010090], the day gets shorter, so the 139 
basal insulin dose given during travel needs to be adjusted (see below). 140 
 141 Figure 1. Overview of protocol with Primary and Secondary en dpoint timelines for 142 
assessment. This journey will be undertaken twice - once using Glargine U100 and 143 
once using Degludec as  the basal insulin.  144 
 145 
 146 
 147 Secondary CGM End -Points  comparing Glargine U100 and Degludec as the basal 148 
insulin are based on recent consensus related to reporting of trials for artificial pancreas 149 
development (17): 150 
• Time in range (70-180 mg/dl) within the first 24 hours after arriving in HNL and 151 
EWR  or JFK  (starting within 2 hours after arrival). 152

BASAL INSULIN ADJUSTMENTS FOR TRAVEL  410 
 411 
Version 2.0, January 18, 2019   12 
 For subjects taking long acting basal insulin by [CONTACT_17838], travel requires a 4% adjustment 412 
to the insulin dose for each time zone traversed (1  hour is 4% of the 24 hour  day) (24 ). To 413 
avoid any confounding from the direction of t ravel,  both journeys will be identical for 414 
each basal insulin , i.e. beginning in Honolulu. With Degludec as the basal insulin, 415 
subjects will ta ke this the next day after arriving at their destination taking into 416 
consideration the change in time at the destination. As shown in clinical trials in T1 and 417 
T2 diabetes, Degludec allows for flexibility in the timing of dose administration provided 418 
a min imum of 8 h and maximum of 40 hours between injections is ensured 419 
(www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23393185 ). [ADDRESS_1010114] travel from Newark (EWR )/or [LOCATION_001] (JFK)  to Honolulu (HNL)  [ADDRESS_1010115] Time (EST) and arrives at 3 PM the same day local (Honolulu [ADDRESS_1010116]). Total travel time is [ADDRESS_1010117] Travel Algorithm ( Appendix 1), information on the starting time at [ADDRESS_1010118] time Glargine should be given -  20 units at 433 
8 PM the prior evening. As a rule, if Glargine is due during a flight, only half the usual 434 
dose (10 units) should be taken.  [ADDRESS_1010119]’s watch/clock should still be on departure time (EST) and the half of the 437 
normal dose (10 units) is given at [ADDRESS_1010120].  Immediately after this, the watch/clock 438 
should be reset to the destination time. Upon landing in Honolulu, the day is now ‘longer’ [ADDRESS_1010121] should give the remaining 50% dose (10 units) at [ADDRESS_1010122] after landing  in Hawaii. The next night, the normal insulin dose (20 units) is [ADDRESS_1010123] at the new location. By [CONTACT_739113] 2 different times, the 443 
Glargine dose is extended out to cover the longer day to prevent hypoglycemia. Use of a 444 
time zone map ( http://www.worldtimezone.com/wtz -pacific24.php ) can help to determine [ADDRESS_1010124] travel from Honolulu (HNL) to Newark (EWR) /or [LOCATION_001] (JFK)  [ADDRESS_1010125], the day gets shorter, so the basal insulin dose given 452 
during tr avel can be adjusted one time using the formula (25) (Appendix 2 ): [ADDRESS_1010126] should resume their normal dosing. For other journeys the number of 456 
time zones to be crossed can be found at http://www.timeanddate.com/time/map/ .  457 
 458 
Here the normal dose (20 units) of Glargine is given at [ADDRESS_1010127] needs to change his/her watch to EST. The [ADDRESS_1010128]’s usual insulin: carbohydrate ratio and correction factor relevant to the [ADDRESS_1010129]’s  glucose falls outs ide of the required [ADDRESS_1010130] will self -treat according to usual practice, printed 473 
information and with the help of study staff traveling with them.   474

comparing basal insulins during long- haul travel. Given the novelty and practical 490 
relevance of the study and our recent information about the challenges face by 491 
individuals with T1D undertaking travel (see above) we believe that this project will have [ADDRESS_1010132] of long -haul travel on glycemic control (CGM derived 495 
data for time in range ( 70-140 mg/dl ) as the primary end point with the assessment 496

RANDOMIZATION AND BLINDING  679 
 680 
The study is open label so no blinding is required.  At randomisation the subjects will be 681 
randomised to Degludec or Glargine as their basal insulin  with the direction of travel 682 
identical for both basal insulin periods .  Randomi zation will be performed using a 683 
computer generated sequence system. There will be a 2 week wash -out period between 684 
each set of trips.    685 
 686 
 687 
CONCOM ITANT ILLNESSES AND MEDICATIONS  688 
 689 
Definitions:  690 
Concomitant illness is defined as any illness that is present at the start of the trial (i.e. at [ADDRESS_1010148] visit).  Concomitant medication are any medications (including over -the-counter) [ADDRESS_1010149] according the criteria listed 694 
above. Details of all concomitant illnesses and medication will be recorded at trial entry 695 
(i.e. at the first visit). Any changes in concomi tant medication will be recorded at each 696 
visit.  The information collected for each concomitant medication includes, at a 697 
minimum, start date, stop date or continuing, and indication. For each concomitant 698 
illness, date of onset, date of resolution or continuing, at a minimum, will be recorded.  699 
 700 
 701 
ADVERSE EVENTS  702 
 703 
An adverse event (AE)  is defined as a ny untoward medical occurrence in a patient or [ADDRESS_1010150] administered /using a Product  that affect the risk/benefit ratio 705 
of the study; the rights, safety, or welfare of the participants or others; or the  integrity of 706 
data of the study. An Adverse Event can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended 707 
sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally [ADDRESS_1010151] treatment follow -up period as defined in the 711 
protocol. The following should not be recorded as AEs, if recorded as medical 712 
history/concomitant illness on the CRF at screening:  713 
• Pre -planned procedure, unless the condition for which the procedure was planned has    [ADDRESS_1010152] has signed the informed 715 
consent  716 
• Pre -existing conditions found as a result of screening procedures  717 
  718 
Serious Adverse Drug Reaction (SADR):  719 
An adverse drug reaction (ADR) is an adverse event (AE) for which a causal relationship [ADDRESS_1010153] possible i.e. causal relationship is conceivable and cannot be 721 
Version 2.0, January 18, 2019   19 
 dismissed. Serious adverse reaction (SAR): Adverse event which fulfils both the criteria 722 
for a Serious Adverse Event and the criteria for an Adverse Reaction.  723 
 724 
Serious Adverse Events  725 
A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as any event that  results in the following : 726 
• Death  727 
• A life -threatening* experience  728 
• In-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_57656] 729 
• A persistent or significant disability/incapacity  730 
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect  731 
• Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening*, or require  [ADDRESS_1010154] and may require medical or surgical 734 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition  735 
• Suspi[INVESTIGATOR_739108]  736 
*The term life -threatening in the definition of SAE refers to an event in which the subject [ADDRESS_1010155] the following information at minimum for each of 743 
these events : 744 
1. Study name  745 
2. Patient identification (e.g. initials, sex, age)  746 
3. Event (preferably a diagnosis)  747 
4. Trial Drug  748 
5. Reporter identification (e.g. Name, or initials)  749 
6. Causality  750 
7. Outcome  751 
All adverse events will be reported by [CONTACT_739121] 752 
compliance with applicable regulations. Adverse events may be volunteered by [CONTACT_1766], 753 
elicited by [CONTACT_1719], or collected via observation by [CONTACT_093]. 754 
 755 
All AEs will be assessed by [CONTACT_739122] 756 
is related to the study procedures or related to the study device, and whether or not the 757 
event meets serious criteria.  If it is determined that an AE has occurred, the investigator 758 
will be responsible for reporting of all adverse events , including serious adverse events 759 
(SAE) and  serious adverse drug reactions (SADRs) , to the compet ent authority and 760 
independent ethics committee/institutional review boards based upon federal regulations 761 
and local/IRB policies.  762 
 763 
Adverse events will be assessed on an ongoing basis throughout the study. Adverse event 764 
reporting will begin at the start time of the study (i.e., insertion of the CGM sensor during 765 
Visit #1) and continue through until subject participation has ended (i.e., either time of [ADDRESS_1010156] was 767 
Version 2.0, January 18, 2019   20 
 discontinued early from t he study). All adverse events will be followed until resolution, [ADDRESS_1010157]’s medical history. In the 772 
event there is a change (i.e., worsening) in the pre -existing medical condition or [ADDRESS_1010158] 803 
Glucagon available as needed for the treatment of severe hypoglycemia. All treatment for 804 
hypoglycemia will be recorded on study forms.  805 
 806 
A SM BG with the glucose meter should be tested anytime there is:  807 
• A low threshold alert (set at 70 mg/dL) on the CGM  808 
• Anytime the participant has symptoms of hypoglycemia  809 
• Anytime staff has concern about the potential for hypoglycemia  810 
• Following treatment for hypoglycemia as indicated 811 
 812 
Hypoglycemia/Hyperglycemia Event Reporting  813 
Version 2.0, January 18, 2019   21 
 For the purpose of this protocol, mild symptom s of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia 814 
(i.e., clinically non- significant) or blood glucose values out of the normal range (whether 815 
or not they resulted in delayed meals or correction boluses) will not be reported as SAEs [ADDRESS_1010159] was 821 
impaired cognitively to the point that they were unable to treat themselves, they were 822 
unable to verbalize their needs, they were incoherent, disoriented, and/or combative, or 823 
they experienced seizure or coma. These epi[INVESTIGATOR_91103] 824 
neuroglycopenia to induce seizure or coma. If plasma glucose measurements are not 825 
available during such an event, neurological recovery attributable to the restoration of 826 
plasma glucose to normal is considered sufficient e vidence that the event was induced by 827 
a low plasma glucose concentration.  828 
 829 
Adverse Event Relatedness  830 
The investigator will be responsible for making a determination on the causal relationship 831 
of the AE. Specifically, the investigator will report whether th e AE was related to the 832 
study procedure, study drug, and/or related to the study device (malfunction of any 833 
component of the Dexcom System). 834 
 835 
The causal relationship to the study procedure and the study device for each adverse 836 
event will be rated as follow s: 837 
• Unrelated: The event is not related to the study drug. 838 
• Possibly Related: The temporal sequence is such that the relationship is not [ADDRESS_1010160]’s condition. There is a possibilit y of any relation between the event and 841 
the study drug. 842 
• Related: The event is related or most likely associated with the study drug. 843

 847 
Adverse Event Severity  848 
The severity of the AE will be rated based upon the following grades:  849 
• Mild – asymptomatic or mild symptoms; usually transient, requires no special [ADDRESS_1010161]’s daily activities  851 
• Moderate – minimal, local or non- invasive  intervention  indicated; usually causes [ADDRESS_1010162] and may interfere with 853 
daily activities, but is usually ameliorated by [CONTACT_14212]  854 
• Severe – medically significant, life -threatening; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_17127] 855 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_374]; interrupts a subject’s usual daily activities and generally 856 
requires system drug therapy or other treatment.  857

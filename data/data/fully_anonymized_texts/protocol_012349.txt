Study Product(s), Dose, Route, Regimen Fluorothymidine is an analog of the nucleoside thymidine (deoxythymidine) but the 3’- F atom prevents FLT from 
following the full biochemical pathway of thymidine. FLT is transported from the blood into cells by [CONTACT_539610]; it does not freely diffuse across the cell membrane. Once in the 
cell, FLT is a substrate for thymidine kinase I (TK1) and is phosphorylated but is not incorporated into DNA. 5mCi of FLT (+/ - 20%) will be given intravenously.

1. Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is usually locally 
advanced and / or metastatic at the time of diagnosis, preventing surgical resection in the majority of cases
2. Initial treatment strategies for resectable, borderline resectable or 
locally advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma includes chemotherapy and chemoradiation (in selected patients). The main therapeutic goal is to reduce disease burden to allow surgical resection, which is the only curative treatment for pancreatic adenocarcinoma to date. After initial treatment, response is revaluated by [CONTACT_539611], usually by a 
dedicated contrast enhanced CT, which is preferred, or alternatively MRI. However, objective evaluation of response in pancreatic cancer is often difficult. CT and MRI have some significant limitations, such as inability to clearly  outline tumor borders due to the 
infiltrative nature of pancreatic adenocarcinomas, and post -treatment imaging changes 
that can simulate tumor. Additionally, it is an anatomic method only that relies on relatively slow macroscopic tumor changes without information regarding tumor metabolism.  
2-Deoxy-2-[
18F]-fluoro -D-glucose (18F-FDG) PET/CT, which is a marker of glucose 
metabolism, is an alternative imaging method, and multiple studies have shown an 
overall sensitivity of 73 to 94% for detection of pancre atic adenocarcinoma, while 
specificity ranges from 60 to 89%. The specificity is reduced because 18F-FDG PET/CT 
is a non- specific tracer that also accumulates in some benign conditions with increased 
glucose metabolism (such as inflammation). Moreover, the rate of false negatives is also

 increased in this population because 20 to 30% of patients with pancreatic 
adenocarcinoma have hyperglycemia, which may significantly decrease the amount of FDG uptake
3-13. For these reasons, more accurate novel PET tracers are expected to have 
a significant clinical impact.  
 
1.2 Study Agent(s) Background and Associated Known Toxicities  
 
 The pharmacology of 3’-deoxy- 3’’[18F]-fluorothymidine (FLT) is based on its 
action as an inhibitor of DNA synthesis. Intracellular metabolism of FLT produces FLT -
phosphates but these nucleotides inhibit endogenous DNA polymerases because they lack a 3'-hydroxyl substituent. This results in premature chain termination of DNA synthesis
14. 
 In a study performed at the University of Washington, Turcotte and colleagues assessed the toxicity of 
18F-FLT in twenty patients with proven or suspected diagnosis of 
non-small cell lung cancer15. All patients gave written informed consent to the 18F-FLT 
injection, and subsequent PET imaging and blood draws. Blood samples were collected for each patient at multiple times before and after 
18F-FLT. These samples were assayed 
for comprehensive metabolic panel, total bilirubin, and complete blood and pla telet 
counts. In addition, a standard neurological examination by a qualified physician was performed for each patient before and immediately after 
18F-FLT. All 18F-FLT doses 
were calculated based on patient weight (2.59 MBq/kg = 0.07 mCi/kg) with a maxima l 
dose of 185 MBq (5.0 mCi). Starting with the 18F-FLT injection, dynamic PET images 
were acquired for [ADDRESS_703306] in the center of the 
left ventricular chamber, blood time activity curves were generated for each pati ent from 
the dynamic PET data and then extrapolated to 720 minutes. This provided a measure of the area under the 
18F-FLT concentration curve for 12 hours (AUC 12). A separate 
estimation of the AUC [ADDRESS_703307] 18F-FLT administration. Only 
albumin, red blood cell count, hemoglobin, and hematocrit show a statistically significant decrease over time. These changes were attributed to IV hydration during PET im aging 
and to subsequent blood loss at surgery. The AUC
12 values estimated from imaging data 
are not significantly different from those found from serial measures of 18F-FLT blood 
concentrations (P = 0.66). No significant neurologic sequelae have been attri buted to 18F-
FLT use in pet imaging to date. As a result, peripheral neuropathy, which had been listed as a possible risk based upon observations at significantly higher doses in early therapeutic HIV studies, is no longer considered a risk of 
18F-FLT use in a micro -dose 
imaging setting. Screening for peripheral neuropathy is not justified based upon the available evidence in multiple 
18F-FLT imaging trials.

 Template Updated: 12/2012; 9/2013; 8/2014; 4/2015; 10/2015; 11/[ADDRESS_703308] infusion: Subjects 1 (119/56 – 133/66) and 4 (120/78 – 163/74). In Subject 4, 
abnormal BP was attributed to discomfort from the head immobilization device. There 
were no clinically relevant events reported. All subjects performed consistently on the pre- and post- neurological exams and there were no changes in status. Four of these analytes demonstrated statistically significant changes on one- way ANOVA: potassium, 
carbon dioxide, total protein, and albumin. Some of the other values were above or below normal, but no pattern was seen except that many were lower on the day of the study. These decreases are attributed to two main factors. Normal saline infusion, which expands blood volume, and arterial blood sampling for kinetic analysis are performed during the procedure, both of which will cause a general lowering of the concentration of blood components. The subsequent recovery of these values to baseline is consistent with this explanation and consistent with the results obtained by [CONTACT_539612]. 
 As discussed above, the m echanism of action of FLT’s toxicity at therapeutic 
dosing levels is based on inhibition of DNA synthesis. Total exposure to the radiolabeled 
agent for PET imaging, will be several thousand times lower than the exposure at which toxicity has been observed in humans. Nevertheless, as with all investigational drugs, patients receiving 
18F-FLT should be observed for adverse events, and promptly treated 
should any adverse effects occur. 
1.3 Other Agents  
Not applicable. 
1.4 Rationale 
The thymidine analog 3’-deoxy- 3’’[18F]-fluorothymidine (FLT) is a proliferation marker, 
which has the potential to perform better in patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma14.  
 Interim studies (usually after 2 cycles of chemotherapy) are commonly used for 
early restaging and to better tailor further management, offering more timely evidence to 
support changing or maintaining therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], when compared to conventional imaging studies. It also has an important role in prognostication. Such study strategies have been extensively explored for breast cancer, and at least three different studies showed significant correlation between findings in early 
18F-FLT PET/CT and patients’ response  
to chemotherapy, giving the possibility of change in chemotherapy regimens in non-responder patients
17-19. 
 The increase d specificity of 18F-FLT PET/CT has an enormous advantage over 
18F-FDG PET/CT as an early assessment study, especially with radiation therapy. 18F-
FDG PET/CT is known to suffer from an increased rate of false positives due to non-specific uptake in post- therapy inflammatory changes during treatment caused by 
[CONTACT_385912] / monocyte infiltration
20. 18F-FLT PET/CT has the potential to overcome this 
imitation as a more specific tracer for tumor proliferation.

detected exclusively in malignant tumors, with a specificity of 100% for detection of 
pancreatic adenocarcinoma22. A more recent study evaluated the role of FLT PET/CT 
using a temporal- intensity information -based voxel- clustering approach termed kinetic 
spatial filtering (FLT PET/CTKSF) for early prediction of res ponse and survival 
outcomes in locally advanced and metastatic pancreatic cancer patients receiving gemcitabine -based chemotherapy. The authors found that FLT PET/CT detected changes 
in proliferation, with early increase in SUVmax predicting progressive di sease with a 
high specificity and PPV
23. 
 
2.0 STUDY OBJECTIVES  
2.1 Primary Objectives  
 To assess if percentage change in 18FFLT PET/CT quantitative parameters 
(SUV max, or SUV peak or proliferative tumor volume) after [ADDRESS_703310] overall survival at 1 and 2 years in patients with 
resectable, borderline resectable or locally advanced pancreatic 
adenocarcinoma.  
2.2 Secondary Objectives  
 To assess if percentage change in 18FFLT PET/CT quantitative parameters 
(SUV max, or SUV peak or proliferative tumor volume) after [ADDRESS_703311] progression free survival at 6 months and 1 year in patients with resectable, borderline resectable or locally advanced 
panc reatic adenocarcinoma.  
2.3 Exploratory Objectives 
None 
2.4 Endpoints  
Primary endpoint is to determine that a positive response (decrease on quantitative 
parameters) at an interim 18F FLT PET/CT (performed after 2 cycles of 
chemotherapy) is related to longer progre ssion free survival and overall survival.

N.B: FDG PET/CT can be performed before or after baseline FLT, but must be within 30days of baseline FLT PET/CT . 
 
The experimental 18F-FLT-PET/CT is required to be completed before initiation of 
chemotherapy. Labs and correlative radiology, as directed per clinical care, are required 
within 30 days prior to 18F-FLT- PET/CT; and optional 18F-FDG- PET/CT  within 30 days 
of the 18F-FLT-PET/CT. Follow -up will comprise [ADDRESS_703316] practice 
treatment and follow up.  
 
 Visit 1: Patients will have at least one visit with investigator (or investigator designee) 
prior to the study to review clinical history and prior tre atment of pancreatic 
adenocarcinoma, and to explain the study. Correlative radiology studies including CT, MRI and /or
18F FDG -PET/CT as per institutional routine clinical care, and any clinically -
directed laboratory tests performed as part of staging. All c linical care tests must be 
performed within 30 days of the 18F FLT- PET/CT.The following additional patient data 
will be obtained: histological diagnosis of primary and/or metastatic disease, date of diagnosis of primary and no evidence of metastatic diseas e, gender, height, weight (for 
BMI), ECOG score and confirmation of absence of prior treatment.  
Visit 2 (optional):  The 
18F-FDG- PET/CT may be done as a research scan  if patients 
agrees to that , if the patient is unable to obtain a clinically -directed 18F-FDG-PET/CT as 
part of their clinical care or within 30 days of 18F FLT- PET/CT, before or after the 
baseline FLT. The research 18F-FDG- PET/CT, in this instance, will be identical in 
procedure to the institution’s clinical 18F-FDG-PET/CT. The blood glucose level will be 
< 200 mg/dl, before 18F-FDG injection, which is institutional standard clinical protocol.

 Visit 3 : Day of 18F-FLT-PET/CT: The patient will have an intravenous line placed in the 
hand or arm, 18F-FLT-PET/CT will be given by 1-2 minute IV push, and the dose 
administered will be approximately 5 mCi (+/- 20% dose). After approximately 60 +/- 10 
minutes of uptake time, the patient will be positioned supi[INVESTIGATOR_539601]/CT scanner for standard whole body PET/CT scan from the skull base to mid- thigh. This scan will take 
approximately 20-30 min. The window from FLT PET/CT baseline study to initiation of chemotherapy should be no more than 30 days.  
Visit 4: Day of Interim 
18F-FLT- PET/CT: The interim 18F FLT- PET/CT will be 
performed after the 2nd cycle of chemotherapy regimen, but before the commencement of 
3rd cycle. The second 18F-FLT-PET/CT study must be performed on the same s canner as 
the first 18F FLT-PET/CT and the imaging protocol described in Visit 3 should be closely 
followed. 
4.1 Study duration:  
Clinical Follow Up: Standard of care clinical follow -up data will be collected up to 2 
years following the end of chemotherapy.

 administrative reasons. The reason(s) for discontinuation will be documented and may 
include: 
 Subject withdraws consent (termination of treatment and follow -up); 
 Subject is unable to comply with protocol requirements;  
 The researchers believe that participation in the research is no longer safe for the subject;  
 Subject experiences toxicity that makes continuation in the protocol unsafe;  
 Treating physician judges continuation on the study would not be in the 
subject’s best interest;  
 Subject becomes pregnant (pregnancy to be reported along same timelines 
as a serious adverse event);  
5.4 Safety  
As with all PET imaging agents, 3' -deoxy-3'- [18F] -fluorothymidine is a 
radiopharmaceutical that decays with positron emission. As such, it poses an intrinsic radiation exposure risk. However, this risk is felt to be extremely small, at the doses administered in this study. The organ and total body doses associated with FLT PET 
imaging are comparable to or lower than those associated with other widely used clinical nuclear medicine procedures.  
 
The radiation absorbed effective dose equivalent to the whole body from intravenously 
injected 
18F-FLT is estimated to be 0.028±0.012 mSv/MBq. The total body doses 
associated with 18F-FLT PET imaging are comparable to or lower than those associated 
with ot her widely used clinical nuclear medicine procedures and are well below the 
maximum suggested for individual study and annual total body dose of [ADDRESS_703317]- FLT infusion will be recorded. 
The adverse events to be specifically monitored during the infusion include localized discomfort at the IV injection site, pain, respi[INVESTIGATOR_046], flushing, dizziness, pruritus/rash, and any other symptoms that could be secondary to an anaphylactic reaction. The subject will be instructed to report any subjective symptoms or sensory changes noted.

 Template Updated: 12/2012; 9/2013; 8/2014; 4/2015; 10/2015; 11/[ADDRESS_703318] - Solid Tumors  
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the new international criteria proposed by [CONTACT_8225] (RECIST) Committee
24. Changes in only the largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) of the 
tumor lesions are used in the RECIST v1.[ADDRESS_703319] of care (up to 2 years). This information will be used for assessment of progression free survival at [ADDRESS_703320] one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as > 20 mm with 
conventional techniques (CT, MRI, x- ray) or as > [ADDRESS_703321] be recorded in millimeters  (or decimal fractions of centimeters).  
Note: Previously irradiated lesions are non -measurable except in cases of documented 
progression of the lesion since the completion of radiation therapy.  
 
Non-measurable disease. All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions 
(longest diameter <20 mm with conventional techniques or <[ADDRESS_703322] scan), are considered non -measurable disease. Bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, 
ascites, pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonis, inflammatory breast disease, abdominal masses (not followed by [CONTACT_462]), and cystic lesions are all non -
measurable.  
Target lesions. All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 3 lesions per organ and 6 
lesions in total, representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions and recorded and measured at baseline. Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest di ameter) and their suitability for accurate 
repeated measurements (either by [CONTACT_14217]). A sum of the longest diameter (LD) for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum LD. The baseline sum LD will be use d as reference by [CONTACT_36928]. 
 
Non-target lesions . All other lesions (or sites of disease) including any measurable 
lesions over and above the 6 target lesions should be identified as non- target lesions and

 * In exceptional circumstances, unequivocal progression in non- target lesions may be 
accepted as disease progression.  
 
Note : Subjects with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of 
treatment without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be reported as 
“symptomatic deterioration” . Every effort should be made to document the objective 
progression even after discontinuation of treatme nt. 
 
Note:  If subjects respond to treatment and are able to have their disease resected, the 
patient’s response will be assessed prior to the surgery.  
6.4.4  Duration of Response  
Duration of overall response : The duration of overall response is measured from the time 
measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  
 
The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met 
for CR until the first date that recurrent disease is objectively documented.   
 
Duration of stable disease : Stable disease is measured from the start of the treatment until 
the criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started.  
6.4.5  Progression -Free Survival  
Progression- free survival (PFS) is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment 
to time of progression. 
 
6.5 Safety/tolerability  
 Analyses will be performed for all subjects having received at least one dose of 
study drug. The study will use the CTCAE version 4.0 for reporting of non- hematologic 
adverse events ( http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html ) and modified criteria for 
hematologic adverse events.

All subjects experiencing an adverse event, regardless of its relationship to study drug, 
will be monitored until:  
• the adverse event resolves or the symptoms or signs that constitute the adverse 
event return to baseline; 
• any abnormal laboratory values have returned to baseline;  
• there is a satisfactory explan ation other than the study drug for the changes 
observed; or 
• death. 
 
 Definition  
Adverse Events will be reported as indicated by [CONTACT_114641] (see 
below).    
An adverse event  is defined as any untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence in a 
human research study participant, including any abnormal sign (for example, abnormal physical exam or laboratory finding), symptom, clinical event, or disease, temporarily associated with the subject’s participation in the research, whether or not it is considered related to the subject’s participation in the research.  
Adverse events encompass clinical, physical and psychological harms. Adverse events occur most commonly in the context of biomedical research, although on occasion, they can occur in the context of social and behavioral research. Adverse events may be expected or unexpected.  
 
 Severity  
Adverse events will be graded by a numerical score according to the defined NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) and version number specified in the protocol. Adverse events not specifically defined in the NCI CTCAE will be scored  on the Adverse Event log according to the general guidelines provided by [CONTACT_264021].   
• Grade 1: Mild

 • Grade 2: Moderate  
• Grade 3: Severe or medically significant but not immediately life threatening  
• Grade 4: Life threatening consequences  
• Grade 5: Death related to the adverse event 
 
 Serious Adverse Events  
ICH Guideline E2A and the UTSW IRB define serious adverse events as those events, 
occurring at any dose, which meets any of the following criteria:  
• Results in death   
• Immediately life -threatening  
• Results in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• Results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• Based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the subject’s health 
and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in this definition.  
 
Note:  A “Serious adverse event” is by [CONTACT_539614]. Serious adverse events may or may not be related to the research project. A 
serious adverse event determination does not require the event to be related to the research. That is, both events completely unrelated to the condition under study and events that are expected in the context of the condition under study may be serious adverse events, indepe ndent of relatedness to the study itself. As examples, a car accident 
requiring overnight hospi[INVESTIGATOR_283060] a serious adverse event for any research participant; Likewise, in a study investigating end -stage cancer care, any hospi[INVESTIGATOR_539603]-specified period of monitoring for adverse and serious adverse events would be a serious adverse event, even if the event observed is a primary clinical endpoint of the study.  
 
All serious adverse events occurring within a 24- hour period post -FLT infusion will be 
recorded.

  Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to Subjects or Others (UPI[INVESTIGATOR_20865]):  
The term “unanticipated problem” is found, but not defined in the regulations for the 
Protection of Human Subjects at 45 CFR 46, and the FDA regulations at 21 CFR 56. Guidance from the regulatory agencies considers unanticipated problems to include any incident, experience, or outcome that meets each of the following criteria: 
• Unexpected (in terms of nature, severity or frequency) AND • Definitely or probably related to participation in the research AND  • Serious or a possible unexpected problem in that the research places subjects or 
others at greater risk of harm than was previously known or recognized. Note: Any serious adverse ev ent would always suggest a greater risk of harm.

All adverse events will be followed up according to good medical practices.  
 Reporting  
The UTSW IRB requires reporting of all UPI[INVESTIGATOR_539604]. For participating centers other than UTSW, local IRB guidance should be followed for local reporting of serious adverse events. All SAEs occurring during the protocol- specified 
monitoring period should be submitted to the UTSW study team within 2 business days of the center learning of the event.  
[IP_ADDRESS] UPI[INVESTIGATOR_539605], and are submitted to the UTSW IRB through the UTSW eIRB by [CONTACT_539615].  Hardcopi[INVESTIGATOR_279177]; FDA Form #3500A forms, or other sponsor forms, if applicable; and/or any other supporting 
documentation available should be submitted to the UTSW study team and will be 
forwarded to the DSMC Coordinator.  The DSMC Coordinator forwards the information onto the DSMC Chairman who determines if immediate action is required.  Follow -up 
eIRB reports, and all subsequent SAE documentation that is available are also submitted to the DSMC Chair who determines if further action is required. (See App endix IV of the 
SCCC C DSMC Plan for a template Serious Adverse Event Form which may be utilized 
when a sponsor form is unavailable and SAE submission to the eIRB is not required). 
  All serious adverse events which occur on research subjects on protocols for which the 
SCCC C is the DSMC of record require reporting to the DSMC regardless of whether IRB 
reporting is required. Hardcopi[INVESTIGATOR_283062] #3500A forms, or other sponsor forms, if applicable; and/or any other supporting documentation available should be forwarded to the DSMC Coordinator.

8.0 DRUG INFORMATION  
3’-deoxy- 3’-[18F]-fluorothymidine  
Other names for the drug(s):  18F FLT  
Classification - type of agent:  Radiopharmaceutical  
Mode of action : Fluorothymidine is an analog of the nucleoside thymidine 
(deoxythymidine) but the 3’- F atom prevents FLT from following the full biochemical 
pathway of thymidine. Once in the cell, FLT is a substrate for thymidine kinase I (TK1) 
and is phosphorylated but is not incorporated into DNA.  
Protocol dose: 5 mCi (+/- 20%)  
Preparation: Provided as unit dose by [CONTACT_539617]. FLT is administered to subjects by [CONTACT_85382] ≤ 10 mL. The drug

 solution is stored at room temperature in a gray butyl septum sealed, sterile, pyrogen -free 
glass vi al and has an expi[INVESTIGATOR_375285] 8 hours.  
Route of administration for this study: intravenous  
Incompatibilities: no known incompatibilities   
Availability: Produced at the UT Southwestern Cyclotron facility under an FDA IND 
Side effects:  
No adverse events have been attributed to Positron- Emission Tomography (PET) 
imaging/diagnostic administration of [3' -deoxy-3'-[18F]fluorothymidine (FLT) at the 
levels injected. Therefore, no adverse events are expected as a result of the intravenous 
(IV) administration of 18F FLT.  
As with many intravenously administered agents, 3'-deoxy-3'-[18F] fluorothymidine could 
cause an allergic reaction that could potentially pose a threat to life (anaphylaxis). This has not been observed in limited human exposure to date. Reasonable precautions will be taken, consistent with normal radiologic and clinical facility practice. The patient will be monitored until the PET procedure is completed, and trained personnel will be available per facility standards.  
 
9.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
9.1 Study  Design/Study Endpoints  
 We anticipate to enroll 20 patients with biopsy proven pancreatic adenocarcinoma 
that are not eligible for resection by [CONTACT_539618]. These patients are going to be treated with chemotherapy only or chemoradiation  in selected cases. These patients 
will undergo an optional
18F FDG PET/CT (as standard of care clinical baseline) and 18F-
FLT PET/CT before treatment (research baseline study), and after two cycles of chemotherapy (research early therapy assessment study).    
 For the 
18F-FLT PET/CT analysis, SUV max, SUV peak and proliferative tumor 
volume will be measured by [CONTACT_539619]. Tumor size and extension will also be evaluated on CT images from the PET/CT study.  
At completion of treatment (6 months after baseline  FLT PET/CT) an anatomic study 
(MRI or CT) will be performed as standard of care in our institution to reassess the tumor and classify it as ressectable or non -ressectable. Also at [ADDRESS_703329] of care anatomic study (MRI or CT) will also be performed and will be revaluated by [CONTACT_539620].

(baseline versus interim) of 0.[ADDRESS_703331], power of 80 %, and the type I 
error rate was set to be 0.05. The expected response to therapy was assumed to be 20%
18,23,25. 
Five patients were added to the sample size to compensate for dropout and no uptake on the baseline scan, leading to a total sample size of 20.  
 
9.3 Data Analyses Plans 
 Primary outcome variable: The difference in SUVmax, SUVpeak and 
proliferative tumor volume between baseline and 2 cycles of chemotherapy will be correlated with overall survival at 1 and 2 years and with progression free survival at 6 months and at 1 year. 
 The primary outcome of the study is to establish which degree of change in the 
PET/CT quantitative parameters can predict patients overall survival and progression free survival. The SUVmax (representing the single voxel with the highest activity concentration), SUV peak (which is defined as the average SUV within a [ADDRESS_703332] metabolic activity) and proliferative tumor volume of the pancreatic tumor will be measured.  
 Univariate and multiple cox regression model are going to be used. P- value less 
than 0.05 will be considered as statistical significant. 
 Secondary outcome variable: the difference in SUVmax, SUVpeak and 
proliferative tumor volume between ba seline and 2 cycles of chemotherapy will be 
correlated with binary tumor outcome measured from MRI/CT (resectable versus non -
resectable disease) at [ADDRESS_703333] correlated variable(s). Areas under the ROC curve (AUC) and corresponding 95% confidence interval will be calculated for all models. Leave one out cross validation will be applied to avoid over- fit.

 Trial monitoring will be conducted no less than  annually and refers to a regular interval 
review of trial related activity and documentation performed by [CONTACT_114650], which includes 
but is not limited to accuracy of case report forms, protocol compliance, timeless and accuracy of Velos entries and AE/SAE m anagement and reporting. Documentation of 
trial monitoring will be maintained along with other protocol related documents and will be reviewed during internal audit. 
 The UTSW SCCC DSMC is responsible for monitoring data quality and patient safety 
for all UTSW SCCC clinical trials.  As part of that responsibility, the DSMC reviews all 
local serious adverse events and unanticipated problems in real time as they are reported and reviews adverse events on a quarterly basis. The quality assurance activity for t he 
Clinical Research Office provides for periodic auditing of clinical research documents to ensure data integrity and regulatory compliance. A copy of the DSMC plan is available upon request. 
 The SCCC DSMC meets quarterly and conducts annual comprehensiv e reviews of 
ongoing clinical trials, for which it serves as the DSMC of record. The QAC works as 
part of the DSMC to conduct regular audits based on the level of risk. Audit findings are reviewed at the next available DSMC meeting. In this way, frequency of DSMC monitoring is dependent upon the level of risk. Risk level is determined by [CONTACT_264031] a number of factors such as the phase of the study; the type of investigational agent, device or intervention being studied; and monitoring required t o 
ensure the safety of study subjects based on the associated risks of the study. Protocol -
specific DSMC plans must be consistent with these principles.

Title of Study: Phase 2 Active Treatment Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of SRK -015 in 
Patients with Later -onset Spi[INVESTIGATOR_102011] (TOPAZ)  
Study Centers:  
Approximately 20 study sites across the [LOCATION_002]  (US)  and Europe  
Phase of Development: 2 
Objectives for Both the Treatment Period and Extension Period s: 
Primary  Objectives : 
• To assess safety and tolerability o f SRK-015 in patients with later -onset (e.g., Type 2 and 
Type 3) spi[INVESTIGATOR_11902] (SMA) 
• To assess the efficacy of SRK -015 by [CONTACT_341932] 3 separate predefined cohorts 
Secondary Objectives:  
• To characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of SRK -015 
• To evaluate the pharmacodynamic (PD) effects of SRK -015 
• To evaluate time to therapeutic effect between low - and high-dose SRK-015 in a predefined 
cohort (Cohort 3) 
• To evaluate the immunogenicity of SRK-015 
• To evaluate the effect of SRK -015 on quality of life  
Methodology: This study will be conducted in approximately 20 study sites across the US and Europe to evaluate the 
safety and efficacy of SRK -015 in  patients with later-onset SMA (e.g., patients with Type 2 and Type 3 
SMA) age 2 through 21 years old. Patients may receive SRK-015 on top of an approved SMA treatment or may receive SRK -015 as m onotherapy. Approximately 55 male and female patients with 
later-onset SMA will be enrolled across 3 separate parallel subpopulations subsequently described as 
cohorts. Patients will receive SRK -015 every 4 weeks during the 52-week Treatment Period, with 
patients in Cohorts 1 and 2 directly assigned high-dose (20 mg/kg) SRK-015 and patients in Cohort 3 
randomized 1:1 double -blind between low-dose (2 mg/kg) and high- dose (20 mg/kg) SRK -015. 
SRK -015-[ADDRESS_423344] 2021 
Confidential Page 5 • Cohort 1, N=20: Ambulatory Type 3 patients, age 5 through 21 years old, approximately 10 of 
whom are not receiving an approved SMA treatment, as well as patients already receiving an approved SMA treatment that had been started after the patient turned 5 years old.  
• Cohort 2, N=15: Type 2 and nonambulatory Type 3 patients, age 5 through 21 years old, already receiving an approved SMA treatment that had been started after the patient turned 5 years old. 
• Cohort 3, N=20: Type 2 patients, age ≥2 years old, already receiving an approved SMA treatment that had been started before the patient turned 5 years old. 
During the S creening Period, all patient screening and eligibility determinations will be conducted after 
informed consent (and, as required by [CONTACT_50844], patient informed assent) has been provided and 
within [ADDRESS_423345] Treatment Period dose. After the second 
dose, visits will occur every 4 weeks through the end of the study (Study Schedule of Assessments). 
Patients who complete the [ADDRESS_423346] the option to enroll into an Extension 
Period  (referred to as Extension Period A), for an additional 52- week  period . There will be no 
interruption in dosing between the completion of the Treatment Period and the start of Extension 
Period  A. Patients who consent to participate in Extension Period  A will  complete  both the Treatment 
Period Day 364 (V15 ) visit  and the Extension Period A Day 364 (E1 ) visit on the same day. 
Based on the results of the prespecified 6 -month safety and efficacy interim analyses, any Cohort 3 
patients who were randomized to recei ve low -dose (2 mg/kg) SRK-015 will be  re-assigned to receive 
high-dose (20 mg/kg) SRK-015 after completion of the Treatment Period. Due to the variability in timing of regulatory authority and/or Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee 
(IEC) approvals, the timepoint at which patients who received  the low  dose (2 mg/kg) will begin 
receiving the high  dose (20 mg/kg) during Extension Period A will vary.  
Patients who complete the 52 -week Treatment Period and choose not to enroll into  Extension Period A 
will be followed for a 12- week Safety Follow-up P eriod after Day 364 (V15) . 
Patients who complete Extension Period A will have the option to enroll into Extension Period B for an additional 52-week period. There will be no interruption in dosing between the completion of 
Extension Period A and the start of Extension Period B. Patients who consent to participate in 
Extension Period B will complete  both the Extension Period A,  Day 728 (E14) v isit and the Extension 
Period B Day 728  (EB1) visit on the same day. 
Patients who complete Extension Period A and choose not to enroll into Extension Period B will be 
followed for a 12- week Safety Follow -up Period after Day 728 (E14). 
Patients who complete the [ADDRESS_423347] the option to enroll into Extension 
Period C for an additional 52-week period. There will be no interruption in dosing between the 
completion of Extension Period B and the start of Extension Period C. Patients who consent to 
participate in Extension Period C will complete both the Extension Period B, Day 1092 (EB14) visit and the Extension Period C Day 1092 (EC1) visit on the same day. 
Patients who complete Extension Period B and choose not to enroll into Extension Period C will be followed for a 12- week Safety Follow -up Period after Day 1092 (EB14). 
Patients who complete the [ADDRESS_423348] 2021 
Confidential Page 6 and choose not to enroll in the separate long-term safety  extension trial will be followed for a 12-week 
Safety Follow -up Period after Day 1456 (EC14). 
Patients will be monitored throughout the Treatment Period, Extension Periods A , B, and C, and the 
Follow-up P eriod for safety. A safety surveillance team (SST) will review safety data throughout the 
duration of the study to assess patient safety . The SST will review safety data approximately every 
[ADDRESS_423349] can evaluate the signal, recommend an appropriate course of action, and ensure the ongoing safety of all patients. 
Study Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1869]: Dosing in the study ma y be suspended at any time for an emergent safety 
concern by [CONTACT_341933](s) and recommend an appropriate course of action. The Sponsor may terminate the study if it 
determ ines that further drug exposure would pose an undue risk to patients. The Sponsor, at its 
discretion, may terminate the study at any time. 
If the study is terminated prematurely, Investigators, regulatory authorities , and IRBs/ IECs will be 
notified promptly. Patients will continue to be followed for 12 weeks after their final dose. 
Individual Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1869]:  Dosing for any individual patient may be suspended or discontinued if the 
patient experiences a serious adverse event (SAE)  related to SRK -015 or a  clinically significant 
nonserious adverse event (AE)  related to SRK -015 that , in the assessment of the Investigator and in 
consultation with the Medical Monitor, warrants suspension or discontinuation from further dosing for 
that patient’s well-being. For patients who have had their dosing suspended, dosing may resume only 
after their AE has resolved and only if it would be considered safe to do so in the assessment of the 
Investigator (and in consultation with the Medical Monitor). For patients who have discontinued 
dosing, the patient will continue to be followed for 12 weeks after their final dose or until the 
resolution of any ongoing clinically significant AE, whichever occurs later. (For the definition of AE 
resolution, please refer to Section  [IP_ADDRESS] Follow -up Reports.) 
Dosing of SRK-[ADDRESS_423350] or at the discretion of the 
Investigator if he/she feels the patient’s safety may be threatened. The Investigator may ask for an ad 
hoc SST meeting to be held for any single event or combination of events that in his/her profe ssional

completing all study procedures and study visits 
15. For patients who are expected to have reached reproductive maturity by [CONTACT_2054], adhere to study- specific contraception requirements  
a. Females of childbearing potential (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS]  for definition) must have a negative 
pregnancy test at S creening and agree to employ highly effective contraceptive measures 
(failure rate of 1% or less per year when used consistently and correctly) for the duration 
of the study and for [ADDRESS_423354] dose of study drug. Effective 
contraception methods are restricted to combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) 
hormonal contraception associated w ith inhibition of ovulation (oral, intravaginal, 
transdermal), progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of 
ovulation (oral, injectable, implantable), intrauterine device, intrauterine hormone-
releasing system, bilateral tubal occl usion, vasectomized partner, or sexual abstinence.  In 
the context of this guidance , sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method 
only if defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk 
associated with the s tudy treatments. The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be 
evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle 
of the patient.

muscle -enhancing supplements) or potentially significant neuromuscular effects (such as 
acetylcholinesterase inhibitors) other than approved SMN upregulator therapy within [ADDRESS_423357], Dosage, and Mode of Administration: SRK-015 is a clear to slightly 
opalescent , colorless to slight ly yellow solution, essentially free from visible particulates, containing 
50 ± 5  mg/mL human anti- proMyostatin mAb protein in 20 mM histidine, 130 mM sodium chloride, 
and 0.02% polysorbate 80, pH 6.[ADDRESS_423358] is stored in a 6R clear, 
USP/EP Type I borosilicate glass vial with a 20  mm Flurotec®-coated, bromobutyl or chlorobutyl 
rubber stopper and 20 mm crimp seal with a flip -off cap. Each vial is filled to allow for a 3 mL 
withdrawal.  
High -dose SRK-015 will be 20 mg/kg and low-dose SRK-015 will be 2 mg/kg. Doses will be diluted in 
normal saline and administered via IV over 2 hours +10 -minute  window. 
All doses will be administered via peripheral IV (or via long -term IV access device such as 
peripherally inserted central catheter or port, if the patient has such a device for their background medical care). The placement of a new long-
term IV access device is not part of this study, not required 
for participation, and should not be conducted if the only reason for it is to recei ve SRK -015. If there 
are no acute reactions following the first 2 doses for a patient, and if the Investigator determines that it 
would be safe to do so, the infusion duration can be changed to less than 2 hours but no shorter than 1 hour.  
Duration of Treatment: 
Treatment Period:  
Total study participation for an individual patient will consist of approximately 4 weeks for Screening, 
52 weeks of study visits, and, if the patient does not enroll into Extension Period  A, 12 weeks of Safety 
Follow-up for a total duration of approximately 68 weeks (approximately 16 months). 
Extension Period A: 
Total s tudy participation for an individual patient who completes both the Treatment Period and 
Extension Period A will consist of approximately 4 weeks for Screening, 104 weeks of study visits, 
and 12 weeks of Safety Follow-up for a total duration of approximately 120 weeks (approximately 
28 months). 
Extension Period B:  
Total s tudy participation for an individual patient who completes the Treatment Period and Extension 
Periods A and B will consist of approximately 4 weeks for Screening, 156 weeks of study visits, and 
12 weeks of Safety Follow -up for a total duration of approximately 172 weeks (approximately 
40 months). 
Extension Period C:  
Total s tudy participation for an individual patient who completes the Treatment Period and Extension 
Periods A, B, and C will consist of approximately 4 weeks for Screening, 208 weeks of study visits, 
and 12 weeks of Safety Follow-up for a total duration of approximately 22 4 weeks (approximately 
52 months). 
Reference Therapy, Dosage, and Mode of Administration: Not applicable

Confidential Page 11 Additional Tertiary Endpoint for Cohort 3: 
• Time to therapeutic effect (described in the statistical analysis plan [SAP]) as compared 
between low- and high- dose SRK-015 arms  
Safety: 
Safety will be evaluated based on occurrence of or changes in the following parameters:  
• Treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and SAEs 
• Vital signs, including blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_697] 
• Height and weight 
• Physical examinations  
• Laboratory assessments (hematology, serum chemistry, coagulation, urinalysis) 
• 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) 
• Concomitant medications  
Safety assessments may be revised if any important safety signals emerge from any ongoing clinical 
studies (including this study).  
Pharmacokinetics, Pharmacodynamics, and Immunogenicity: 
Blood samples for the measurement of SRK- 015 concentrations, circulating latent myostatin 
concentrations, and anti -SRK-015 antibodies will be obtained prior to dosing on Day 0 and throughout 
the Treatment and Extension Periods as well as the Safety Follow -up Period as indicated in the Study 
Schedule of Assessments.  
Sample Size  Rationale: 
Sample sizes for each cohort were based on practical considerations. Sample sizes for Cohorts 1 (n=20) 
and Cohort 2 (n=15) each provide 80% power to reject the null hypothesis (expressed as means) 
relative to prespecified alternative hypothesis using a paired t -test with two-sided 5% Type 1 error for 
the mean change from Ba seline for predefined cohort-specific primary efficacy endpoints. For Cohort 3 
(n=20), the effect size to compare dose groups is also justified for detection with 80% power and 
two-sided 5% Type I error for a 1:1 randomization (high dose versus low  dose) as well as the 
treatment -specific effect sizes that will reject the null hypothesis of no mean difference according to 
two-sided testing for a predefined primary efficacy endpoint.  
Statistical Methods : 
Safety and efficacy endpoints will be separately analyzed by [CONTACT_341935] 3, by [CONTACT_341936]. The safety and efficacy endpoints will also be analyzed for different cohort/dose combinations 
taking cohort, dose level and receiving background SMA therapy into consideration. Any change s in 
the analysis as specified in the protocol will be delineated in the SAP.  
Vital signs and laboratory outcomes will be summarized  within each treatment group within all cohorts 
and the 2 dose groups within Cohort 3. The incidence rate of AEs and TEAEs w ill be  reported. 
The primary efficacy endpoints will be summarized  within cohorts. In addition to the primary efficacy 
endpoint, there are multiple secondary efficacy endpoints to help characterize the multi -dimensional 
aspects of each cohort and to plan subsequent clinical studies in support of approval. All continuous 
endpoints will be summarized  within cohorts; corresponding two-sided 95% confidence intervals will 
be computed. 
A prespecified interim analysis to evaluate the initial drug exposure (i.e., PK) and target engagement 
(i.e., PD) will be conducted. For Cohorts [ADDRESS_423362] 2 doses of SRK -015. Data from 
multiple cohorts may be combined as necessary. Based on the interim analysis results, and taking into 
consider ation any available safety data, cohort-specific dose levels may be adjusted. Any adjustment in 
dose level will not change the frequency of dosing (i.e., every 4 weeks) and the highest dose will not 
exceed 30 mg/kg, as tested in the Phase 1 study. 
Additionally, prespecified cohort- specific interim analyses to evaluate the initial safety and efficacy of 
SRK-015 in patients with SMA will be conducted after all patients complete Day 168 (Visit 8) or are 
terminated from the study. Interim analyses will be perfo rmed on the efficacy endpoints in addition to 
all safety outcomes and available PK and PD results. Safety data at all visits and efficacy endpoints at 
Day 168 (Visit 8) will be included in this analysis.

Confidential Page 20 4. INTRODUCTION 
4.1. SRK -015 
Api[INVESTIGATOR_341893] ( SRK -015) is an investigational, fully human, monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) that 
specifically binds to proforms of myostatin, which include proM yostatin and latent myostatin, 
thereby [CONTACT_341937]. The antibody is produced in Chinese Hamster Ovary 
cells stably transfected with expression vectors encoding for the heavy and light chains of the antibody. SRK-015 is being developed for the treatment of spi[INVESTIGATOR_11902] (SMA) in pediatric and adult patients. SRK-015 is administered by [CONTACT_33980] (IV) infusion. 
4.2. Spi[INVESTIGATOR_341900] a rare, autosomal recessive neuromuscular disease characterized by [CONTACT_341938][INVESTIGATOR_1831], resulting in atrophy of the voluntary 
muscles of t he limbs and trunk. SMA directly results from reduced levels of survival motor 
neuron (SMN) protein, caused by [CONTACT_341939], infrequently, mutations within the 
survival motor neuron 1 ( SMN1 ) gene on chromosome 5q13.2. The lack of SMN protein ca uses 
the motor neurons to become dysfunctional and, eventually, to die. 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_179799] a rare disorder, SMA is the most common genetic cause of infant mortality and a 
major cause of childhood morbidity ( Pearn 1973; Sugarman 2012). The reported birth prevalence 
of SMA ranges from 8.5 to 10.3 per 100,000 live births ( Arkblad 2009; Jedrzejowska 2013; 
Prior 2010; Sugarman 2012). The clinical phenotype of patients with SMA can vary significantly 
between patients who die soon after birth to patients who live into adulthood without symptoms. 
A major determinant of clinical phenotype is the number of copi[INVESTIGATOR_341901] a second gene, 
SMN2 . There is a normal variance of SMN2  gene copi[INVESTIGATOR_341902] [ADDRESS_423374] 2 or 3 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (Crawford 2012; Fang 2015).  
Prior to the development of advanced molecular medicine techniques that allow genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_341903]1  and SMN2  copy numbers, SMA was diagnosed based on clinical presentation and 
categorized phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_341904]. This phenotypic classification system requires subjects to be followed for enough time to determine whether a milestone will or will not be achieved. Because subjects 
may have been enrolled into a clinical trial  before they were old enough to achieve certain motor 
milestones, for example sitting independently, a classification system based on age of symptom 
onset was used for clinical trial enrollment ( Finkel 2015).  
Type 0 or prenata l SMA is a rare type in which infants are born with clinical manifestations of 
disease, including major joint contractures and respi[INVESTIGATOR_7798], which result in a requirement for mechanical ventilation and ultimately lead to death at or shortly after  birth 
(Dubowitz 1999; Finkel 2015; MacLeod 1999; Mercuri 2012).  These patients usually have 
[ADDRESS_423375] common form of SMA and represents approximately 58% of the birth 
prevalence ( Ogino 2004). More than 90% of patients with 2 copi[INVESTIGATOR_149385]2  will develop Type 1 
SMA ( Feldkötter 2002), and these infants usually present with hypotonia, loss of motor function, 
and failure to achieve new milestones within the first [ADDRESS_423376] 2021 
Confidential Page 21 able to sit without support ( De Sanctis 2 016; Russman 2007; Wang 2007). The major cause of 
morbidity and mortality in patients with Type 1 SMA is pulmonary disease due to neuromuscular 
weakness ( Wang 2007 ). In the absence of respi[INVESTIGATOR_1413], only 1.3% of infants with Type 1 
SMA survive beyond 24 months of age ( Gregoretti 2013).  
Type 2 SMA  represents approximately 29% of the birth prevalence ( Ogin o 2004). Patients with 
Type [ADDRESS_423377] 3 copi[INVESTIGATOR_102005]2  gene but can vary between 2 and 4 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. More 
than 80% of patients with 3 copi[INVESTIGATOR_149385]2  will develop Type 2 SMA ( Feldkötter 2002). 
Children fail to achieve motor milestones because of proximal weakness and hypotonia that typi[INVESTIGATOR_341905] 18 months of life. This group is generally defined by [CONTACT_341940] ( Rudnik-Schöneborn 2001). However, the 
progressive nature of the disease means some of these patients will lose their ability to sit independently over time ( Faravelli 2015; Russman 2007; Wang 2007). Orthopedic and 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_341906] a major cause of morbidity and mortality, and only 70% of patients with Type 2 SMA are alive at 25 years of age ( Faravelli 2015).  
Type 3 SMA  represents approximately 13% of the birth prevalence ( Ogino 2004). Patients with 
Type [ADDRESS_423378] 3 or 4 copi[INVESTIGATOR_102005]2 gene. More than 80% of patients with 
4 copi[INVESTIGATOR_149385]2 will develop Type 3 SMA (Feldkötter 2002). Milestone achievement can vary 
greatly in SMA Type 3; some patients may maintain their ability to walk, while other patients have a level of functioning that more closely resembles SMA Type 2 ( Finkel 2015). The 
distinguishing milestone for SMA Type 3 is the ability to walk unaided; however, the majority of patients lose that function over time ( Rudnik-Schöneborn 2001). Ambulatory patients with  
Type 3 SMA commonly suffer from substantial motor functional impairment, as evidenced by 
[CONTACT_341941] (HFMSE) scores and 6-Minute Walk 
Test (6MWT) distances ( Mercuri 2016; Montes 2010). Some patients with Type [ADDRESS_423379] 
orthopedic problems that are comparable to those experienced by [CONTACT_341942] 2, although generally with later onset and decreased severity ( Haaker 2013).  
Type [ADDRESS_423380] form of SMA, and its occurrence is rare (<1%). Patients with 
Type [ADDRESS_423381] 4 or more copi[INVESTIGATOR_102005]2 gene. After symptom onset, which has 
been reported a fter 10 years  of age but more commonly after 20 to 30 years of age ( Wang 2007), 
patients experience mild to moderate muscle weakness and increasing disabilities. Patients are ambulatory, and their life expectancy is normal (Faravelli 2015).  
4.3. Current Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_341907], SPI[INVESTIGATOR_341908]® (nusinersen) is approved for the treatment of pediatric and adult 
patients  with SMA , EVRYSDI™ (risdiplam) is approved for the treatment of pediatric and adult 
patients ≥2 months of age with SMA, and ZOLGENSMA® (onasemnogene abeparvovec- xioi) is 
approved for the treatment of pediatric patients less than [ADDRESS_423382] 2021 
Confidential Page 22 contractures and neuromuscular scoliosis through bracing, physical therapy, and surgery ( Wang 
2007). 
SMN upregulator therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (also referred to as SMN corrector therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]), such as nusinersen, 
onasemnogene abeparvovec -xioi, and other products in development (e.g., small molecule SMN 
upregulators) act primarily upon motor neurons to prevent further loss. While approved treatments have shown improvement in motor function in younger patients with SMA, they do not act directly on the muscle to primarily address already-existing atrophy and motor functional 
impairment in patients with symptomatic SMA. Consequently, there remains an unmet need for 
an effective muscle -directed therapy that can address muscle atrophy and motor functional 
impairment in patients with SMA.  
4.4. Safety Rationale for SRK -015 
SRK -015 has been evaluated in a single Phase 1 study (SRK-015-001). This two-part, 
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, first- in-human trial was designed to evaluate the 
safety and tolerability, immunogenicity, pharmacokinetics ( PK), and pharmacodynamics ( PD) of 
intravenously administered SRK-015 in adult healthy subjects. A total of 66 subjects were enrolled, including 40 subjects in Part A, single ascending dose (SAD) and 26 subjects in Part B, multiple ascending dose (MAD). Subjects in the SAD were randomized 3:1 to receive single 
doses of SRK-015 or placebo across 5 dosing cohorts (1, 3, 10, 20, and 30 mg/kg), while subjects in the MAD were randomized 3:1 to receive multiple biweekly doses (on Days 0, 14, and 28) of SRK -015 or placebo across 3 dosing cohorts (10, 20, and 30 mg/kg). Both parts of the study have 
been compl eted.  
Results of the study show that there were no dose- limiting toxicities (up to the highest dose 
tested of 30 mg/kg), deaths, subject discontinuations due to an adverse event (AE)  related to 
SRK -015, serious adverse event (SAE) related to SRK -015, sever e or life -threatening AEs 
related to SRK -015, or hypersensitivity reactions. The most common AE was headache in the 
SAD and postural dizziness in the MAD, which were observed in both the SRK-015 and placebo 
groups. Immunogenicity was assessed by [CONTACT_313568] (ADA) testing, and all SRK-015 
treated subjects tested negative.  
Based upon PK analysis, SRK-015 displayed a well-behaved PK profile (e.g., low coefficient of 
variation) generally consistent with that observed with monoclonal antibodies. Drug expos ure 
was dose proportional, and the serum half-life was 23 to 33 days across the SRK-015 dose 
groups in the SAD study. The findings support the investigation of a once every 4- week  dosing 
regimen in this  Phase 2 study (SRK-015-002). 
No toxicologically significant findings have been observed to date for SRK-015 across the good laboratory practice (GLP) nonclinical toxicology studies. The no- observed -adverse -effect level 
(NOAEL) was the highest dose tested of 300 mg/kg weekly in the [ADDRESS_423383] dose tested of 100 mg/kg weekly in the 4-week GLP nonclinical toxicology study in nonhuman primates and the 4- week 
GLP nonclinical toxicology study in rats. Based upon PK data from the SAD portion of the Phase 1 study, the drug exposure in this Phase 2 clinical study of monthly IV administrations of SRK -015 at the planned high-dose level of 20 mg/kg (or the maximum potential dose level of 
30 mg/kg) is predicted to be substantially less than that attained and evaluated in the nonclinical toxicity studies.  
SRK -015-[ADDRESS_423384] 2021 
Confidential Page 23 For further detail on the Phase 1 clinical results and nonclinical findings, including findings that 
were not toxicologically significant, please refer to the SRK-015 Investigator’s Brochure. 
4.5. Therapeutic Rationale for SRK -[ADDRESS_423385] (through the inhibition of myostatin activation), it is hypothesized that SRK-015 may address muscle atrophy and improve motor function ( Han 2013).  
The preclinical data, mechani stic rationale, and translational insights of SRK -[ADDRESS_423386]- twitch fibers; in SMA, there is prominent 
atrophy of fast- twitch fibers and associated functional impairment.  SRK -015 (or its murine 
version) has demonstrated the ability to substantially increase fast- twitch fi ber mass across 
multiple animal species, including nonhuman primates. In an SMA mouse model, treatment 
robustly increased muscle strength (as measured by [CONTACT_341943]) ( Long 2018 ). 
Data from the Phase 1 clinical study ( SRK -015-001) of fer initial evidence that SRK -[ADDRESS_423387] (thus, suggesting target saturation) even after a single treatment at doses of 3 mg/kg or greater, and sustain this effect for at least several months following a single dose of 20 mg/kg or greater. Relatively faster clearance of latent 
myostatin was observed with lower doses of SRK-015, suggesting that higher doses offer 
sustained target engagement. Together, these data provide evidence that systemic adm inistration 
of SRK -[ADDRESS_423388] population of 
patients  with SMA  who may or may not be on background SMN upregulator therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] 
(e.g., nusinersen). As such, SRK-[ADDRESS_423389] study of SRK-015 
in patients with Type 2 and Type 3 SMA is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 
SRK -015 in patients who are receiving background SMN upregulator therapy (Cohorts 1, 2, and 
3) and in those who are not (Cohort 1). The study will assess the effects of SRK-015 upon motor function outcome measures (e.g., HFMSE, Revised Hammersmith Scale [RHS], and Revised Upper Limb Module [RULM]) that are designed for SMA, validated in SMA, and considered 
clinically meaningful. In addition, the study will characterize the effect of SRK-[ADDRESS_423390] upon motor function from inhibiting the activation of myostatin. Int erim analyses will explore whether clinical effects are evident earlier.  
Three optional Extension Periods ( 52 weeks each ) have been added to the study to observe the 
long- term safety and efficacy effects of SRK -[ADDRESS_423391] dose tested (300 mg/kg IV 
SRK -015 weekly). Data from the SAD portion of the Phase 1 study demonstrated a generally 
well-behaved PK profile for SRK-015, and SRK-015 dosing will be weight-based in this  Phase 2 
study. To initially confirm that drug exposure or target engagement in pediatric patients does not substantially differ from that observed in the Phase 1 study in adult healthy volunteers, interim PK and PD analyses will be conducted in a small number of patients in this  Phase 2 study. Based 
upon these results, and taking into consideration any available safety data, the dose levels may be adjusted in this  Phase 2 s tudy. Any adjustment in dose level will not change the frequency of 
dosing (i.e., every 4 weeks) and the highest dose will not exceed 30 mg/kg, as tested in the Phase [ADDRESS_423392] in-human study in healthy volunteers, multiple doses of up to 30 mg/kg were generally safe and well tolerated. PK results from the Phase [ADDRESS_423393] incre ases in latent myostatin 
concentrations in the serum above baseline and demonstrate successful target engagement in 
humans. Moreover, the levels of target engagement attain a plateau, suggesting that the target has 
been saturated even with a single treatment of SRK-015 at doses of 3 mg/kg or greater. This level of PD marker appears to be sustained for approximately 84 days following a single 20 mg/kg dose, suggesting that the PD effect is durable. 
SRK -015-[ADDRESS_423394] 2021 
Confidential Page 25 The 20 mg/kg high- dose arm is aimed at attaining target satu ration rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375] (e.g., within several 
weeks after the first dose) and sustaining that saturation with chronic administration. Based upon 
PK data from the Phase 1 SAD study, the drug exposure from monthly IV administrations of SRK -015 at 20 mg/kg is predicte d to be substantially less than that attained in the nonclinical 
toxicity studies to date.  For further detail on the Phase 1 PK and PD results, please refer to the 
SRK -015 Investigator’s Brochure. 
Dose exploration will be conducted in this study by [INVESTIGATOR_3086] a low-dose arm of 2 mg/kg. At this 
dose level, it is anticipated that target saturation will not be attained upon the first dose and thus 
would require additional dosing. By [CONTACT_341944]-dose arm and comparing it with that observed from the 20 mg/kg level, the relationship 
between drug exposure and therapeutic effect over time can be interrogated. Insights into the 
level of drug exposure necessary to initiate improvements in motor function will also be attained. Together, results from this analysis will inform the dosing regimen for future clinical studies of SRK -015 in SMA. 
The results of the prespecified 6-month safety and efficacy interim analyses in this study, including greater improvements in HFMSE scores for the high-dose arm and no identification of 
safety signals, support ed a change in dose for Cohort 3 patients from low-dose (2 mg/kg) to 
high-dose (20 mg/kg) SRK-015 during Extension Period A (See Section  6.2). The preliminary 
results of the 12-month analysis continue to support the dose change. For further detail s on the 
Phase 2 safety and efficacy analyses results  please refer to the SRK -015 Investigator’s Brochure.

6.1. Overall Study Design  
Study SRK-015-002 is an active treatment study of SRK-015 in patients age 2 through 21 years 
old with later -onset SMA. Patients may receive SRK -015 as monotherapy or in addition to an 
SMN upregulator therapy approved for SMA. 
The study will be conducted at approximately 20 study sites across the US and Europe and will 
enroll approximately 55 patients with SMA  across 3 separate parallel subpopulations 
subsequently described as cohor ts: 
• Cohort 1, N=20: Ambulatory Type [ADDRESS_423397] 10 of whom are not receiving an approved SMA treatment, as well as patients already receiving an approved SMA treatment that had been started after the patient turned 
5 years old. 
• Cohort 2, N=15: Type 2 or nonambulatory Type 3 patients, age 5 through 21 years old, already receiving an approved SMA treatment that had been started after the patient turned 5 years old. 
• Cohort 3, N=20: Type 2 patients, age ≥[ADDRESS_423398] of 3 parts : Screening, Treatment , and Follow-up. 
1. During the Screening P eriod, all patient screening  and eligibility determinations will be 
conducted after informed consent (and, as required by [CONTACT_50844], patient informed 
assent) has been provided and within [ADDRESS_423399] dose. All subsequent motor function outcome measures will be conducted within 96 hours prior to dosing. 
2. During the 52-week Treatment Period, patients enrolled in Cohorts 1 and 2 will receive high-dose (20 mg/kg) SRK-015 and patients enrolled in Cohort 3 will be randomized 
(1:1) in a blinded manner to receive either low-dose (2 mg/kg) or high- dose (20 mg/kg) 
SRK -015 ( Figure 1 ). All treatments will be administered by [CONTACT_341946] [ADDRESS_423400] dose will be administered on Day 0 and the final dose on Day 336, for a total of 13 doses. There will be a ±7-day window 
around each dosing visit, with a minimum of [ADDRESS_423401] 2 doses for a patient, and if the Investigator determines that it would be safe to do so, the infusion 
duration can be changed to less than 2 hours but no shorter than 1 hour. 
Following each dose, patients will be contact[CONTACT_341947] 7 days as a safety 
check- in (in the Treatment Period only) . Patients will be seen in clinic [ADDRESS_423402] 2021

the study site during the Treatment Period. 
The last Treatment Period visit will be on Day 364 (V15). 
Total study participation for an individual pa tient who completes  the Treatment Period 
will consist of approximately 4 weeks for Screening, 52 weeks of study visits, and, if the

followed for a 12- week Safety Follow-up Period after Day 728 (E14) . Thes e patients will 
have a total of 26 doses. Patients who complete the 52-week Extension Period B and 
choose not to enroll in optional Extension Period C will be followed for a 12- week Safety

6.2. Treatment Assignment  
Eligible  patients in Cohorts 1 and 2 will receive high-dose (20 mg/kg) SRK-015. P atients in 
Cohort 3 will be  randomized 1:1 to low- (2 mg/kg) or high-dose (20 mg/kg) SRK-015 without 
stratification  for th e duration of the Treatment Period. Based on the results of the prespecified 
6-month safety and efficacy interim analyses (data cutoff date of [ADDRESS_423408] 2020), any Cohort 3 patients who were randomized to receive low -dose (2 mg/kg) SRK-015 will be  re-assig ned to 
receive high -dose (20 mg/kg) SRK-015 after completion of the Treatment Period. The 
preliminary results of the 12-month analysi s (database lock date of 19 January 2021) continue to 
support the dose change. For further detail on the Phase 2 safety and efficacy analyses results 
please refer to the SRK -015 Investigator’s Brochure. Due to the variability in timing of 
regulatory authority and/or Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC)  approvals, the timepoint at which patients who received the low dose (2 mg/ kg) will begin 
receiving the high dose (20 mg/kg) during Extension Period A will vary.

6.3. Safety Oversight and Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1869]  
6.3.1. Safety Surveillance Team  
A safety surveillance team (SST) will review safety data throughout the duration of the study 
(inclusive of Treatment , Extension and Safety  Follow-up Periods) to assess patient safety. The 
SST will review safety data approximately every [ADDRESS_423433] by a 
biostatistician as will be described in the statistical analysis plan (SAP). The SST reviews will 
not include any efficacy data. The responsibilities and actions of the SST will be governed by a separate SST charter outside of this protocol. 
6.3.2. Pharmacokinetic Criteria for Dose Adjustment  
The SST will review PK and PD data for each cohort as part of a prespecified interim analysis 
(refer to Section  11.4). Drug exposure and target engagement levels in patients with SMA  will be 
evaluated to compare them to the levels seen in the Phase 1 healthy adult study. Data from 
multiple cohorts may be combined as necessary and will be provided by a biostatistician. Based on these results, and taking into consideration any available safety data, cohort- specific dose 
levels may be adjusted. Any adjustment in dose level will not change the frequency of dosing (i.e., every 4 weeks) and the highest dose will not exceed 30 mg/kg, as tested in the Phase [ADDRESS_423434] can completely evaluate 
the event(s) and recommend an appropriate course of action. 
The SST may make recommendations to restart dosing and continue the study with no changes, 
continue the study with changes to the protocol, terminate the study, or require more data, input, 
and deliberation prior to making a decision. Criteria for study termination are based on the assessment of safety concerns that may arise during the conduct of the study or from data from 
the SRK -015 preclinical and clinical program. The study may be discontinued at any time at the 
Sponsor’s discretion, or if the SST determines that further drug exposure would pose an undue 
risk to patients.  
If the study is terminated prematurely, all Investigators, regulatory authorities and IRBs/  IECs  
will be notified promptly. Patients will continue to be followed for 12 weeks after their final dose. 
6.3.4. Individual Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_341910]-015 or a clinically significant non- serious AE related to SRK -015, that in 
the assessment of the Investigator and in consultation with the Medical Monitor, warrants 
suspension or discontinuation from further dosing for that patient’s well-being. For patients who 
have had their dosing suspended, dosing may resume only after their AE has resolved and only if it would be considered safe to do so in the assessment of the Investigator (and in consultation 
with the Medical Monitor). For patients who have discontinued dosing, the patient will continue 
to be followed for 12 weeks after their final dose or until the resolution of any ongoing clinically significant AE, whichever occurs later. (For the definition of AE resolution, please refer to Section  10.2.1.) 
Dosing of SRK-[ADDRESS_423435]  or at the discretion of the 
Investigator if he/she feels the patient’s safety may be threatened. The Investigator may ask for an ad hoc SST meeting to be held for any single event or combination of events that in his/her professional opi[INVESTIGATOR_341895].

a. Females of childbearing potential  (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS] for definition)  must have a 
negative pregnancy test at Screening and agree to employ highly effective 
contraceptive measures (failure rate of 1% or less per year when used consistently 
and correctly) for the duration of the study and for [ADDRESS_423440] dose of study drug. Effective contraception methods are restricted to combined (estrogen 
and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of 
ovulation (oral, intravaginal, transdermal), progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation (oral, injectable, implantable), intrauterine 
device, intrauterine hormone-releasing system, bilateral tubal occlusion, 
vasectomized partner, or sexual abstinence. In t he context of this guidance, sexual 
abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from 
heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study 
treatments. The reliability of sexual abstinence n eeds to be evaluated in relation to the 
duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient . 
b. Male patients with female partners of childbearing potential must be abstinent or 
agree to employ the use of a condom with or without spermicide throughout the duration of the study and for [ADDRESS_423441] dose of study drug.

7.3. Patient Withdrawal Criteria  
Patients may withdraw consent at any time. Participation in the study may be terminated at any time without the patient’s conse nt as determined by [CONTACT_737]. The Investigator may 
withdraw a patient from the study for any of the following reasons: 
• Protocol violation 
• Serious or intolerable AE (see Section  6.3.4) 
• Clinically significant change in a laboratory parameter (see  Section  6.3.4) 
• Sponsor or Investigator decision 
• Patient and/or parent or guardian request 
7.4. Patient Rescreening, Replacement, and Over -enrollment  
A patient who is determined to be eligible based on screening assessments and experiences an acute or comorbid condition that causes a delay in their Baseline v isit and first infusion (Day 0) 
may remain eligible up to an additional [ADDRESS_423444] rescreen to determine eligibility.  
Patients who withdraw from the study for reasons that are not related to safety  before receiving 
4 doses of SRK-015 and undergoing 2 postdose HFMSE or RHS assessments may be replaced at the discretion of the Sponsor. 
Patients who are in the Screening Period at the time a cohort has enrolled its required number of 
patients may continue to be enrolled after they are determined to be eligible. 
To preserve the robustness of the analyses, the Sponsor may enroll additional patients into a 
cohort as a result of patients in that cohort who significantly change their background approved 
SMA treatment while on study (e.g., a patient discontinues nusinersen or begins a new approved 
treatment as part of standard of care for their SMA).  
SRK -015-[ADDRESS_423445] 2021 
Confidential Page 45 7.5. Patient Enrollment into the Optional Extension Period s 
Patients who choose to enroll into Extension Period A should review and sign the informed 
consent form (ICF) prior to performing any assessments being conducted on Day 364 ( V15). A 
patient is determined to be eligible for enrollment into Extension Period A after completion of 
the 52- week Treatment Period.  Patients may consent to participate in Extension Period A at any 
time prior to V15/E1  or at V15/E1. 
Patients who choose to enroll into Extension Period B should review and sign the ICF  prior to 
performing any assessments being conducted on Day 728 (EB1). A patient is determined to be 
eligible for enrollment into Extension Period B after completion of the 52- week Extension 
Period  A. Patients may consent to participate in Extension Period B at any time prior to E14/E B1 
or at E14/E B1. 
Patients who choose to enroll into Extension Period C should review and sign the ICF prior to 
performing any assessments being conducted on Day 1092 (EC1). A patient is determined to be eligible for enrollment into Extension Period C after completion of the 52-week Extension 
Period B. Patients may consent to participate in Extension Period C at any time prior to EB14/EC1 or at EB14/EC1. 
 
SRK -015-[ADDRESS_423446] is a clear to slightly opalescent, colorless to slightly yellow solution, 
essentially free from visible particulates, containing 50 ± 5 mg/mL fully human anti-
proMyostatin mAb protein in 20 mM histidine, 130 mM sodium chloride, 0.02% polysorbate 80, 
at pH 6.[ADDRESS_423447] formulation does not contain novel excipi[INVESTIGATOR_341914].  
SRK -015 is a sterile, preservative-free liquid stored in a 6R clear, USP/EP Type I borosilicate 
glass vial with a 20 mm Flurotec
®-coated, bromobutyl or chlorobutyl rubber stopper, and [ADDRESS_423448]. 
Preparation and dispensing of the study drug will be handled by [CONTACT_159439]. Instructions 
for safe handling of the study drug are provided in the Pharmacy Manual. 
SRK -015 will be administered to patients at one of two dose levels: 20 mg/kg and 2 mg/kg, 
according to the cohort assignments. Doses will be diluted in normal saline and administered by 
[CONTACT_204108] 2 hours ( +10-minute window). I f there are no acute reactions following the first 2 doses 
for a patient, and if the Investigator determines that it would be safe to do so,  the infusion 
duration can be changed to less than 2 hours but no shorter than 1 hour. 
All doses will be administered via peripheral IV (or via long -term IV access device such  as a 
peripherally inserted central catheter or port, if the patient has such a device for their background 
medical care). The placement of a new long -term IV access device is no t part of this study, not 
required for participation, and should not be conducted if the only reason for it is to receive 
SRK -015. 
If an acute reaction occurs, further dosing will be suspended and the Investigator, in consultation with the Medical Monitor if needed, will evaluate the risk represented by [CONTACT_341950]. 
Such an evaluation will incorporate consideration of the nature of the event, relatedness to the drug, and seriousness and severity of the event. 
Intervention for patients who experience an acute infusion reaction should be performed in 
accordance with standard procedures and may include restarting the infusion at a slower rate, 
terminating the infusion, administration of medications, or other medically supportive measures, 
as necessary.  
8.3. Randomization and Blinding  
Cohorts 1 and 2 are directly assigned to the 20 mg/kg dose of SRK-015 while Cohort 3 patients 
will be randomized (1:1) in a double-blind manner to receive either 2 mg/kg or 20 mg/kg 
SRK -015 via an Interactive Web -based Randomization System (IWRS). Use of the IWRS will 
be outlined in the Study Operations Manual and in the IWRS quick reference guide. 
SRK -015-[ADDRESS_423449] will remain unblinded throughout the duration of the study. The Sponsor will be blinded to individual efficacy data until prespecified interim analyse s are performed (see 
Section  11.4). The Sponsor will remain blinded to efficacy data not included as part of the 
interim analyses until the Treatment Period database lock  or deemed necessary by [CONTACT_120460]. 
Select personnel of the Sponsor (e.g., Lead Clinical Research Associate and auditors) will have access to efficacy data to ensure study oversight. 
For unblinding procedures refer to Section  [IP_ADDRESS]. Based on interim anal ysis at 6 months 
(Day  168),  which was supported by [CONTACT_941] 12-month analysis (Day 364), any Cohort 3 patients who 
were randomized to receive low -dose (2 mg/kg) SRK-015 will be re- assigned to receive 
high-dose (20 mg/kg) SRK-015 after completion of the Treatment Period (see Section  6.2).  
Original blind designation will be maintained . In accordance with Section  6.3.1, the SST reviews 
will not include any efficacy data. 
8.4. Study Drug Compliance  
Study drug will be administered under the supervision of the Investigator or qualified site 
personnel. The study site is required to adhere to all applicable laws, regulations, and guidelines 
including, but not limited to, the [LOCATION_002] (US) Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), the 
International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as well as any applicable local and federal regulations. 
8.5. Study Drug Packaging and Labeling  
Study drug will be supplied by [CONTACT_341951].  
8.6. Study Drug Storage and Accountability  
All supplies of SRK-[ADDRESS_423450] be stored refrigerated (2ºC to 8ºC/36ºF to 46ºF) in the carton and 
protected from light, in a securely locked area, and accessible to authorized persons only, until 
needed for dose preparation. 
The Investigator (or designee) is responsible for maintaining accurate accountability records of 
the investigational product throughout the clinical study. The site Pharmacist will inventory the 
investigational product received and will maintain records of disposition of the drug, including dates, quantity, and use. All dispensing and accountability records will be available for Sponsor 
review. Study drug accountability will be verified during on- site monitoring visits. At the en d of 
the study, Study Monitors  or designees will conduct a final accountability of all study drugs. 
8.7. Study Drug Disposal and Return  
Following accountability of study drug by a Study Monitor, used vials may be destroyed at the 
site according to local standard operating procedures (SOPs) containing well-documented 
destruction procedures. Unused vials should be returned to Scholar Rock, or its designated 
storage location, for final disposition.

the patient, is permitted at the discretion of the Investigator and supersedes any of the restrictions outlined in this protocol. 
Patients may receive an approved SMA treatment in accordance with the cohort they are enrolled 
into ( Section  6.2). Patients are expected to remain on the same background SMA therapy 
(e.g., on an SMN upregulator therapy such as nusinersen, or not on any SMA therapy) for at least 
[ADDRESS_423452] igators who contemplate changing a patient’s standard of care treatment for their SMA are 
encouraged to discuss this with the Medical Monitor in advance. 
Patients that receive the SMN upregulator treatment, nusinersen, must receive their maintenance 
doses at least [ADDRESS_423453] 14 days prior to any scheduled SRK -015 study drug administration visit. Any change in the timing of the patient’s nusinersen 
treatment that would fall within 14 days prior to the scheduled SRK- 015 admi nistration should 
be discussed with the Medical Monitor in advance.

9.1.1. Efficacy Parameters  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Revised Hammersmith Scale 
The RHS will be performed for the ambulatory patient subgroup (Cohort 1). Administration of 
the RHS includes the timed rise from floor and 10-M eter Walk/Run tests. The RHS is a 36- item 
clinical assessment for physical abilities of patients with Type [ADDRESS_423457] level of ability/function and [ADDRESS_423458] level of 
ability ( Ramsey 2017). The remaining 3 items are scored 0, 1, where 0 denotes an inability and 
1 denotes an ability to achieve. The maximum achievable score is 69. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. 10-M eter Walk/Run  
The 10-M eter Walk/Run test is an enhanced function of the RHS used for ambulant patients with 
Type 3 SMA. It is a measure of the time taken to walk/run 10 meters. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Timed Rise from  Floor 
The timed rise from floor test is an enhanced function of the RHS used for ambulant patients 
with Type 3 SMA. It is a measure of the time taken to rise to standing from the floor. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. 6-Minute Walk Test  
The 6MWT is an assessment of exercise capacity and fatigue that has been used in clinical 
studies of ambulatory patients with  later -onset S MA ( Young 2016) Ambulant patients in 
Cohort [ADDRESS_423459] 2021 
Confidential Page 51 [IP_ADDRESS]. 30-S econd Sit -to-Stand 
The 30-S econ d Sit- to-Stand Test is used by [CONTACT_341954] ( Jones 1999). The test was modified for ambulatory SMA 
population based on recent research of the modified 30-Second S it-to-Stand being a reliable, 
feasible tool for use in a general geriatric population with a lower level of function ( McAllister 
2019) and was related to fall risk in institutionalized veterans ( Applebaum 2017, Le Berre 2016 ). 
The test measures the maximal number of times the patient can transition from sitting to standing 
in 30 seconds. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Hammersmith Functional  Motor Scale Expanded  
The HFMSE assesses the physical abilities of patients with Type 2 and Type 3 SMA ( O'Hagen 
2007; Glanzman 2011) and will be performed for nonambulatory patient subgroups (Cohorts 2 
and 3). It consists of 33 items graded on a scale of 0, 1, 2, where 0 denotes unable, 1 denotes 
performed with modification or adapta tion, and 2 denotes without modification or adaptation. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Revised Upper Limb Module  
The RULM is  a 20 -item assessment of upper limb function in nonambulatory patients with SMA  
(young children as well as adults) ( Mazzone 2017). The [ADDRESS_423460] functions that relate 
to everyday life, such as placing hands from lap, pressing a button, and pi[INVESTIGATOR_85354] a token. The items are scored 0, 1, 2, where 0 denotes unable, 1 denotes able with modification, and 2 denotes able with n o difficulty. The maximum score achievable is 37. Nonambulant patient subgroups 
(Cohorts 2 and 3) will perform the RULM. The RULM will be completed by [CONTACT_326911] 30 months of age or older at the time of the baseline assessment. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. WHO Motor Development Milestones  
The WHO Multicentre Growth Reference Study performance criteria is being utilized to 
assess motor development milestones of patients with Type 2 and nonambulatory Type  3 
SMA enrolled in Cohort 2 and Cohort 3.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Endurance Shuttle Nine Hole Peg Test  
The ESNHPT is an endurance test for severely affected patients with SMA. Patients are instructed to repeatedly perform the original [ADDRESS_423461] at 75% of their individual 
maximum speed. The shuttles refer to the set speed marked by [CONTACT_341955], with the test ending when the patient missed 2 consecutive beeps. The p rimary outcome parameter is “time to 
limitation (Tlim) ,” which is defined as the time a task can be maintained at the pre- set intensity. 
Maximum test duration is 20  minutes ( Stam 2018).  Nonambulant patients who score ≤3 on 
Item A of the RULM at Screening will perform the ESNHPT at Screening and all subsequent 
assessments. The ESNHPT will be completed by [CONTACT_341956] 8 years of  age or 
older during the study. Patients who turn 8 years of age in Extension Periods A, B, or C  who 
score ≤3 on Item A of the RULM at Screening should perform the ESNHPT as early as possible (preferred to begin at E1 ) and at all subsequent assessments until the end of the study. 
SRK -015-[ADDRESS_423462] 2021 
Confidential Page 52 [IP_ADDRESS]. Endurance Shuttle Box and Block Test  
ESBBT is an endurance test for moderately affected patients with SMA. Patients are instructed 
to repeatedly perform the original Box and Block Test at 75% of their individual maximum 
speed. The shuttles refer to the set speed marked by [CONTACT_341955], with the test ending when the patient missed [ADDRESS_423463] 
duration is 20 minutes ( Stam 2018). Nonambulant patients who score >3 on Item A of the 
RULM at Screening will perform the ESBBT at Screening and all subsequent assessments. The ESBBT will be comp leted by [CONTACT_341956] 8 years of age or older during the 
study. Patients who turn 8 years of age  in Extension Periods A, B, or C  who score >3 on Item A 
of the RULM at Screening should perform the ESBBT as early as possible (preferred to begin at 
E1) and at all subsequent assessments until the end of the study. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory Computer Adaptive Test 
A caregiver (who may or may not be a parent and/or legal guardian) must comple te the PEDI -
CAT Assessment. The PEDI -CAT Assessment should not be administered if a caregiver is not 
present. The PEDI-CAT Assessment should not be administered to the patient. The PEDI- CAT 
is a questionnaire completed by [CONTACT_341957]’s ability to perform daily functions ( Haley 2005 ). The PEDI -CAT is filled out by [CONTACT_341958] a location where they are 
not watching the patient perform any functional assessment tests. The same caregiver must fill 
out the assessment throughout the study duration. The answers are scored on a 4- point scale 
(unable to easy). The test is suitable to assess function in newborns to 21- year-olds ; this 
questionnaire should be completed throughout the duration of the study (regardless of age) . 
Properties of the PEDI-CAT have been studied in the SMA population. A Rasch analysis with 
results published in 2016 revealed that the distribution of abilities for the Mobility and Daily Activities domains of the PEDI -CAT are bes t represented in the Type 2 and Type 3 populations 
(Pasternak 2016).  As the PEDI -CAT is an age -dependent questionnaire, a patient’s full date of 
birth is required for accurate assessment.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Patient -reported Outcomes Measurement Information System 
The Patient -reported Outcomes Measurement Information System ( PROMIS ) is a person -
centered measure intended to be completed by [CONTACT_341959] ( Ader 2007). The fatigue profile domain measures a range of symptoms, from mild 
subjective feelings of tiredness to an overwhelming, debilitating, and sustained sense of 
exhaustion. The self- report measures are suitable for children [ADDRESS_423464] complete the form throughout the study duration. Patients age 18 through 21 years old  will complete an adult form of PROMIS. The PROMIS will be 
completed  by [CONTACT_341956] 5 years of age or older at the time of the baseline 
assessment ; the same questionnaire used at S creening should be used throughout the duration of 
the study (regardless of age).

(from the stop of the infusion) sample collection on Day [ADDRESS_423467] be collected via peripheral venipuncture. 
Each collected sample will be split into approximately equal volume sample sets to allow for retesting, if required. Aliquots from the PK blood samples may be used for biomarker testing 
(Extension Period C only) or additional PD or  immunogeni city testing as appropriate, and 
Baseline and post baseline samples may be used to support PK, PD, and/or ADA assay 
validation . 
9.3. Pharmacodynamics Blood Sample Collection  
Blood samples will be collected for the measurement of latent myostatin levels. These blood 
samples will be obtained prior to infusion as indicated in the schedule of assessments in Table 2, 
Table 3, Table 4, and Table  5. The 2-hour (+30-minute window) postdose (from stop of infusion) 
sample collection on Day [ADDRESS_423468] be collected via peripheral venipuncture. Each collected sample will be split into approximately equal volume sample sets to allow for retesting, if required. Aliquots from the PD blood samples may be used for biomarker testing (Extension Period C 
only) or additional PK or immunogenicity testing as appropriate, and Baseline and post baseline 
samples may be used to support PK, PD, and/or ADA assay validation. 
9.4. Immunogenicity Blood Sample Collection  
Blood samples for the measurement of anti -SRK -015 antibodies will be obtained prior to 
infusion as indicated in the schedule of assessments in Table 2, Table 3, Table  4, and  Table 5. 
Each collected sample will be split into approximately equal volume sample sets to allow for 
retesting, if required. Aliquots from the immunogenicity samples may be used for biomarker 
testing  (Extension Period C only) or additional PK or PD testing as appropriate , and Baseline and 
postbaseline samples may be used to support PK, PD, and/or ADA assay validation. 
9.5. Biomarkers (Extension Period C Only)  
Aliquots from PK, PD, and ADA serum samples collected during Extension Period C will be 
stored and may be used for exploratory biomarker testing. These samples may be used for 
research to d evelop methods, assays, prognostics, and/or companion diagnostics related to 
discovering and/or evaluating effects of SRK-015. Additional blood samples will not be 
collected for the purposes of biomarker testing.

infusion, and 1 hour (±15 minutes) postinfusion. Body temperature will be collected preinfusion. 
10.1.3. Weight and Height 
Weight and height will be collected according to the schedule of assessments provided in Table 2, Table 3, Table 4 , and  Table 5. Weight will be collected within 48 hours of each dose to 
calculate weight -based dosing and height will be collected at visits where the motor function 
outcome measures are conducted. Standing height will be collected for all individuals who are 
able to independently stand. Surrogate height may be estimated using ulna length if the patient is nonambulatory or needs standing support. 
10.1.4. Physical Examination 
A complete physical examination will be performed by [CONTACT_29517] a qualified designee 
according to the schedule of assessments provided in Table 2, Table 3, Table 4, and Table 5. The 
findings of each examination will be recorded on the source documents and eCRF. The physical examination will include an assessment of the following: general appearance, skin, lymph nodes, head -eyes-ears-nose- throat, neck , abdomen, extremities, and the respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], cardiovascular, 
musculoskeletal, and neurologic body systems. 
10.1.5. Electrocardiogram  
A 12 -lead electrocardiogram (ECG) will be collected at the times indicated in  Table 2, Table 3, 
Table 4, and Table 5. ECGs are to be performed with the patient having rested for at least

Confidential Page 55 10.1.6. Concomitant Medications 
All concomitant medications will be collected from the time the patient signs the  ICF through 
12 weeks after the final dose.  
10.1.7. Laboratory Assessments 
Laboratory testing (eligibility screening, serum chemistry, hematology, urinalysis, and 
coagulation, PK and PD sample draw, and ADA testing) will be performed using established 
methods at the times indicated in  Table 2, Table 3, Table 4, and Table 5. When multiple sample 
collection types are performed at the same assessment time point, the samples will be drawn in 
the following order (depending on what sample types are to be collected at that time point): 
laboratory safety samples (hematology, coagulation, serum chemistry, urinalysis), PK, PD, 
ADAs. Aliquots from the PK, PD, and ADA samples may be retained as back -up for retesting if 
necessary. The total blood draw for each patient who completes the 52- week Treatment Period, 
will be approximately [ADDRESS_423471] approximately 13 mL of additional

postmenopausal unless permanently sterile. Permanent sterilization methods include 
hysterectomy, bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_15559]. A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for [ADDRESS_423473] be confirmed with serum testing.  
Patients who become pregnant during the study should not receive further study drug and should be followed according to the procedures outlined in Section  [IP_ADDRESS]. 
SRK -015-[ADDRESS_423474] 2021 
Confidential Page 57 10.2. Adverse and Serious Adverse Events  
10.2.1. Definition of Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Adverse Event  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical study patient administered a 
pharmaceutical product that does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the 
treatment administered. An AE can, therefore, be any unfavorable or unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not related to the medicinal product. 
• AEs may be new events or may be preexisting conditions that have become aggravated or have worsened in severity, seriousness, or frequency from Baseline at any time during the study. 
• AEs may be clinically significant changes from Baseline in physical examination, laboratory tests, or other diagnostic investigation. 
Any medical condition already present at Screening should be recorded as medical history and not be reported as an AE unless the medical condition or signs or symptoms present changes in severity, frequency, or seriousness at any time during the study. In this case, it should be reported as an AE.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is any adverse experience occurring at any dose that results in any of the following outcomes: 
• Death  
• Life-threatening experience; Note: “Life-threatening” refers to a situation in whi ch 
the patient was at immediate risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that might have caused death if it were more severe.  
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]. The following are 
excluded as per this criterion: 
− Emergency room visits/hospi[INVESTIGATOR_341918] [ADDRESS_423475]. 
− A scheduled or elective hospi[INVESTIGATOR_341919]/surgical procedure planned prior to informed consent for a preexisting condition that has not worsened from 
Baseline during participation in the study. However unexpected complications 
and/or prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_341920]. Admission to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_341921] (i.e., no place to stay, too far away to come for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_97893], respi[INVESTIGATOR_4594]) will not be considered inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602].  
• Persistent or significant disability or incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability 
to conduct normal life functions 
SRK -015-[ADDRESS_423476] 2021 
Confidential Page 58 • Congenital anomaly or birth defect 
• Is considered to be an important medical event: Important medical events are those 
that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_341922]. Examples of such medical events include allergic 
bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], or the development of drug dependency. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Dosing Errors  
All dosing errors (including, but not limited to, route of administration and wrong dose) must be reported as protocol deviations. A brief description should be provided in the deviation report, 
including information about whether the patient was symptomatic or not. Dosing details should 
be captured in the eCRF.  
An overdose is defined as a significant variation from the recommended/scheduled dosage for a 
product. The dosing for this study will be conducted in a controlled clinical setting and an 
overdose is not anticipated. However, in the event of an accident, for this study, an overdose of SRK -[ADDRESS_423477] 2-fold higher than 20 mg/kg. 
Overdoses are not considered AEs and should not be recorded as an AE in the eCRF unless an AE or an SAE occurs. All overdoses (regardless of whether or not they result in an AE) must be recorded in the eCRF . If an overdose results in an SAE, the SAE form must be completed and 
faxed to S cholar Rock  or designee (e.g., [COMPANY_003] ). Should an overdose occur, the Investigator or 
designee must contact [CONTACT_27909] 24 hours. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pregnancy  
Pregnancy is not an AE; however, if a female patient or female partner of a male study patient 
becomes pregnant during the conduct of the study, the Investigator must notify [COMPANY_003]  according to 
the procedures provided in Section  [IP_ADDRESS]. A patient becoming pregnant while on study drug 
will immediately be withdrawn from further dosing and will be followed according to the 
procedures provided in Section  [IP_ADDRESS]. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Treatment -Emergent Adverse Event  
An AE is treatment emergent if the onset time is after administration of the first dose of study 
drug through the final follow-up visit or, in the event that onset time precedes study drug administration, the AE increases in severity during the Safety Follow-up Period. 
SRK -015-[ADDRESS_423478] 2021 
Confidential Page 59 10.3. Adverse Event Monitoring  
Each patient will be monitored for the occurrence of AEs, including SAEs, from the signing of 
the ICF through the final follow-up visit. 
• Patients will be questioned and/or examined by [CONTACT_29517] a qualified designee 
for evidence of AEs. The questioning of patients with regard to the possible occurrence of AEs will be generalized such as, “How have you been feeling since your last visit?” The presence or absence of specific AEs should not be elicited from patients.  
• Patients having AEs will be monitored until resolution or stabilization (in the case of persistent impairment), or until the event becomes chronic in nature, or the patient dies. 
• AEs, actions taken as a result of AEs, and follow-up results must be recorded in the eCRF 
as well as in the patient's source documen tation. Follow-up laboratory results should be 
filed with the patient's source documentation. 
For any SAEs or AEs that require the patient to be discontinued from dosing, relevant clinical 
assessments and laboratory tests will be repeated as clinically app ropriate, until final resolution 
or stabilization of the event(s). Patients will continue to be followed through 12 weeks after the final dose. 
All safety laboratory analyses will be performed at a central laboratory. The clinical laboratory 
values will be  reported to the Investigator who will review them for clinical significance and 
consideration of abnormal values as potential AEs. 
10.3.1. Relationship to Study Drug  (Causality Assessment)  
A medically qualified Investigator must assess the relationship of any AE (including SAEs) to 
the use of the investigational product, as related or not related, based on clinical judgment and using all available information, and may include consideration of the following factors: 
• The temporal sequence from study drug administration 
• Underlying, concomitant, intercurrent diseases 
• Concomitant use of other drugs 
• Whether the manifestations of the AE are consistent with known actions or toxicity of the investigational product 
• Exposure to physical and/or mental stresses 
• The pharmacology and PK  of the study drug 
• The AE resolved or improved with decreasing the dose or stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_341923] (dechallenge). Judgment should be used if multiple products are discontinued at the same time.  
The causal relationship between the study drug and the AE will be assessed using one of the following categories: 
• Not Related: Factors consistent with an assessment of Not Related may include: 
− Temporal relationship is lacking (e.g., the event did not occur within a reasonable 
time frame following administration of the study drug); or 
SRK -015-[ADDRESS_423479] 2021 
Confidential Page 60 − Other causative factors more likely explain the event (e.g., a preexisting 
condition, other concomitant medications) 
• Related: Factors consistent with an assessment of Related may include:  
− There is a positive temporal relationship (e.g., the event occurred within a 
reasonable time frame following administration of study drug) 
− The AE is more likely explained by [CONTACT_226189] (e.g., the AE shows a pattern consistent with previous knowledge of the investigational product or the class of the investigational product). 
10.4. Assessment of Expectedness  
As part of the regulatory reporting requirements, the Sponsor must perform an assessment of expectedness (expected/unexpected from the perspective of previously observed, not on the basis 
of what might be anticipated from the pharmacological properties of a medicinal product) for 
AEs. Adverse reactions will be considered unexpected if the nature, seriousness, severity or outcome of the reaction(s) is not consistent with the reference safety information section of the Investigator’s Brochure. 
10.5. Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events  
Clinical and laboratory AEs will be graded using the National Cancer Institute Common Term inology Criteria for Adverse Events, Version 5.0. 
The term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event (as in mild, 
moderate, or severe myocardial infarction); the event itself, however, may be of relatively minor 
medical significance (such as severe nausea). This is not the same as “serious,” which is based on patient/event outcome or action criteria usually associated with events that pose a threat to a patient’s life or functioning. 
10.6. Recording Adverse Events  
Each patient will be monitored for the occurrence of AEs, including SAEs, from the signing of 
the ICF through the final follow-up visit. Patients and/or their legal guardians will be questioned, 
and the patients may be examined by [CONTACT_29517] a qualifie d designee for evidence of 
AEs. Patients having AEs will be monitored with relevant clinical assessments and laboratory 
tests, as determined by [CONTACT_737]. 
For each AE, the Investigator will evaluate and record the requested information in the eCRF and 
the patient’s source documentation. 
10.6.1. Instructions for Recording AEs in eCRF  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Recording Diagnosis Versus Signs and Symptoms  
If a patient reports signs and symptoms that represent a medical diagnosis/syndrome, the final 
diagnosis/syndrome should be recorded in the eCRF rather than each sign and symptom 
(e.g., cough, runny nose, fever = upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_4416]). However, if a medical diagnosis cannot be made, then each sign or symptom should be recorded as an individual SAE or AE, as appropriate. 
SRK -015-[ADDRESS_423480] 2021 
Confidential Page 61 [IP_ADDRESS]. Abnormal Laboratory Values or Vital Signs 
Protocol defined laboratory values and vital signs should not be reported as AEs unless the 
abnormal laboratory value or vital sign meets at least one of the following: 
• Requires an adjustment in the study drug(s) or discontinuation of treatment; 
• Requires medical or surgical intervention; 
• Is associated with accompanying signs/symptoms that are not considered part of a 
preexisting diagnosis or syndrome (or if considered part of a preexisting diagnosis or 
syndrome, is associated with disease worsening); or  
• Is considered clinically significant by [CONTACT_737], 
10.7. Reporting Serious Adverse Events  
10.7.1. Serious Adverse Event Reporting  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Initial Reports  
All SAEs occurring from the time of informed consent through the final study visit must be reported to [COMPANY_003]  within 24 hours of the awareness of the occurrence (this refers to any AE that 
meets any of the aforementioned serious criteria). ( Note : The change in reporting from Medpace 
to [COMPANY_003] became effective on 20 May 2021). All SAEs tha t the Investigator considers related to 
study drug occurring after the study must be reported to the Sponsor. 
To report the SAE, the SAE form will be completed electronically in the electronic data capture 
(EDC) system for the study. When the form is compl eted, [COMPANY_003] Safety personnel will be notified 
electronically and will retrieve the form. Any supporting documentation (e.g., discharge 
summary, diagnostic results) must be redacted by [CONTACT_341960] (contact 
[CONTACT_31307]). 
If the E DC system cannot be accessed for technical reasons and the event meets serious criteria, 
complete the back -up paper SAE form and send via email or fax to [COMPANY_003]  (contact [CONTACT_340611]) or call the [COMPANY_003]  SAE reporting line (phone number listed below). When t he EDC system

Confidential Page 62 [IP_ADDRESS]. Follow- up Reports  
The Investigator is required to follow SAEs until resolution, stabilization (in the case of 
persistent impairment), or until the event becomes chronic in nature, or the patient dies. SAE 
resolution is defined as: 
• Resolved with or without residual effects 
• A return to Baseline for a preexisting condition 
• Laboratory values have returned to Baseline or stabilized  
• The Investigator does not expect any further improvement or worsening of the event 
• Fatal outcome - if an autopsy is performed, the autopsy report should be provided to 
the Sponsor as soon as it is available. 
Within [ADDRESS_423483] update 
the SAE form electronically in the EDC system for the study and submit any supporting 
documentation (e.g., patient discharge summary or autopsy reports) to [COMPANY_003] \ via fax or email. All 
supporting patient documentation must be redacted for personal details as per Good Clinical 
Practice (GCP). If it is not possible to access the EDC system, refer to the procedures outlined above for initial reporting of SAEs. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Reporting Pregnancies  
If a female patient or the female partner of a male patient becomes pregnant during the course of 
the study, the Investigator must report the pregnancy to [COMPANY_003]  within [ADDRESS_423484] the paper e xposure in utero (EIU) form to the Investigator/site for 
completion. The Investigator/site must complete the EIU form and fax/email it back to [COMPANY_003] 
within 24 hours. The Investigator/site must obtain consent to collect pregnancy information (including the status of the newborn, if applicable). 
The patient or partner should be followed by [CONTACT_42498], 
whenever possible. Once the outcome of the pregnancy is known, the follow-up EIU form should 
be completed and faxed/emailed to [COMPANY_003] within 24 hours. At the completion of the pregnancy, 
the Investigator will document the outcome of the pregnancy. If the outcome of the pregnancy 
meets the criteria for immediate classification as an SAE ( i.e., postpartum complication, 
spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly), the Investigator should 
follow the procedures for reporting an SAE.

Confidential Page 63 [IP_ADDRESS]. Unblinding a Patient’s Treatment During the Study  
Treatment Period : 
In the event of a drug-related, serious, unexpected AE, Scholar Rock will provide the Cohort 3 
patient’s dose level  for the purpose of regulatory authority agency reporting, if  appropriate. 
Because all patients in the study receive SRK -015, unblinding of a Cohort 3 patient’s dose level 
(i.e., high vs. low dose) by [CONTACT_341962]. In the event of a drug- related SAE, 
the Inves tigator may, if deemed medically necessary to provide patient care, and after 
consultation with the Medical Monitor, obtain the patient’s dose level from the IWRS system. 
Extension Periods: 
Any Cohort 3 patients who were randomized to receive low-dose (2 mg/kg) SRK-015 will be re-assigned to receive high-dose (20 mg/kg) SRK-015 after completion of the Treatment Period 
(see Section  6.2). As of Protocol Version 5.0, unblinding is no longer applicable because all 
Cohort [ADDRESS_423486] switch ed 
to the high dose. 
10.7.2. Expedited Reporting by [CONTACT_328769] a Regulatory Health Authority  
The Sponsor/designee will manage the expedited reporting of relevant safety information to 
concerned health authorities in accordance with local laws and regulations. The 
Sponsor/designee wi ll also inform all Investigators as required per local regulation.  
SRK -015-[ADDRESS_423487] 2021 
Confidential Page 64 11. STATISTICS  
11.1. General Methodology  
All analyses will be performed under GCP standards using a prospective SAP. Analyses will be 
conducted using Statistical Analysis System (Version  9.4 or later, Cary, North Carolina). 
The study is regarded as 3 separate cohorts; therefore, no Type I error is allocated towards separate cohort testing. No formal statistical testing will be applied for the interim analysis and no alpha spending will be applied. Two-sided 95% confidence int ervals (CIs) will be reported. 
There will be an interim analys is conducted when prespecified enrollment (see below) and 
treatment duration have been reached for all 3 cohorts (see Section  11.4); the final analysis will 
be conducted once each cohort completes the 52- week Treatment Period. Biostatistics Data 
Review Meetings will be held for the final analyses to distinguish between major and minor protocol violations. Both Per -Protocol and Intention- to-Treat (ITT) populations will be analyzed, 
with the ITT population being the primary analysis population. 
Any changes in the analysis as specified in the protocol will be delineated in the SAP. 
11.2. Analysis Strate gy 
All prespecified safety and efficacy endpoints will be analyzed by [CONTACT_341963] 3. All patients with any postbaseline data will be included in the interim and primary  
analys es. In addition, safety and efficacy data for the high dose will be analyzed for different 
cohort/dose combinations taking cohort, dose level, and receiving background SMA therapy into consideration. For the change from Baseline analyses (to utilize the patient as their own control 
for response analyses), the last observation before the first dose will be used as the Baseline. 
Cohort 3 low- vs high- dose treatment outcomes will also be evaluated for the time to response as 
a descriptive outcome.  
11.2.1. Safety Analyses 
Safety data will be evaluated for vital signs, laboratory outcomes, concomitant medications, ECGs, and AEs. Clinically significant outcomes will be noted. Vital signs and laboratory outcomes will be summarized  within  each treatment group within all cohorts and the 2  dose 
groups within  Cohort 3. AEs will be coded in the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities; 
the emphasis will be on treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs); the TEAE type, incidence, severity, relationship, onset and resolution time will be displayed descriptively. T he incidence 
rate of AEs and TEAEs will be reported . 
11.2.2. Efficacy Analyses 
Efficacy data will be evaluated for multiple measures with continuous endpoints (e.g., HFMSE score, RHS score, RULM score, etc.) at time points specified  in Table 2, Table 3, Table 4, and 
Table 5. The primary endpoints and other efficacy continuous endpoints will be summarized  
within cohorts and by [CONTACT_341964] 3; corresponding two -sided 95% CIs will be 
computed as well. Similar analyses for different cohort/dose combinations will be explored. The 
HFMSE, RHS, and WHO motor development endpoints will be further categorized to assess the 
SRK -015-[ADDRESS_423488] 2021 
Confidential Page 65 specific distributions of the change from Baseline (waterfall displays of unit changes from 
Baseline) and the proportion of patients reaching certain milestones. 
Waterfall charts will be generated to display the distribution of improvement from Baseline for 
HFMSE, RHS, RULM, and other unit- based measures at post baseline milestones in support of 
efficacy and future study planning. 
Time to outcome improvement will be  assessed using Kaplan -Meier lifetables to characterize 
time to efficacy for Cohort [ADDRESS_423489] 1 posttreatment 
result  from the ADA sample collection. I mmunogenicity will be ev aluated through a 3-tier ADA 
assay  (screening, confirmatory, and titer) and a neutralizing antibody assay. The number and 
percent of patients who become positive for ADAs and who develop neutralizing antibodies will 
be listed and summarized in tabular format using descriptive statistics  by [CONTACT_9084], visit, dose and 
schedule, and overall. 
11.3. Sample Size Rationale  
Sample sizes for each cohort were based on practical considerations. Sample sizes of 15  to 
20 patients for each cohort will provide 80% power to reject the null hypothesis involving mean 
changes from Baseline within each treatment group relative to prespecified alternative 
hypothesis using a paired t- test with two-sided 5% Type [ADDRESS_423490] sizes 
within dose groups that can be detected with 80% power and two-sided 5% Type I error as well 
as the effect sizes that will reject the null hypothesis of no difference according to two -sided 
p=0.05. As illustration, assuming a 2.5-unit standard deviation (SD) for the change from 
Baseline for HFMSE, a mean 1.7-unit improvement for HFMSE (n=20) and a mean 2-unit 
improvement for HFMSE (n=15) can be detected with 80% power while a mean 1.2-unit improvement in HFMSE (n=20) and a mean 1.3- unit improvement in HFMSE reaches two-sided 
p=0.05 (rules out a 0 as the two -sided 95% CI for the change from Baseline).

In addition, the total sample size for Cohort 3 (n= 20) provides 80% power to reject the null 
hypothesis of no mean change from Baseline against the prespecified difference between doses for a clinically meaningful improvement at a two -sided 5% Type I error for a 1:1 randomization 
(high dose vs. low dose).

Baseline for comparing Cohort 3 low vs. high dose. If the SD of the change from Baseline is 
2.5 units for HFMSE, then a mean 2.4-unit difference between low and high dose will reach two-sided p=0.05 (rules out 0 as the lower two- sided 95% CI as the mean difference between 
dose groups).

11.4. Interim Analyses  
11.4.1. Pharmacokinetic and P harmacodynamic Interim Analysis  
Prespecified interim analyses to initially evaluate drug exposure (i.e., PK) and target engagement 
(i.e., PD) in patients with SMA will be conducted. For Cohorts [ADDRESS_423496] 2 doses of SRK -015. Data from multiple cohorts may be co mbined as necessary . 
Enrollment will continue while the interim analysis is ongoing. Based on these results, and 
taking into consideration any available safety data, the cohort- specific dose levels may be 
adjusted. Any adjustment in dose level will not change the frequency of dosing (i.e., every 4 weeks) and the highest dose will not exceed 30 mg/kg, as tested in the Phase 1 study. 
11.4.2. Safety and Efficacy Interim Analyses 
Prespecified interim analyses to evaluate the initial safety and efficacy of SRK -015 in pa tients  
with SMA  will be conducted when all enrolled patients complete Day 168 (Visit 8 ) or are 
terminated from the study. Interim analyses will be performed on the efficacy endpoints in 
addition to all safety outcomes and available PK and PD results. Safet y data at all visits and 
efficacy endpoints at Day 168 (Visit 8) will be included in this analysis.

Confidential Page 70 14. QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE  
An electronic data system will be used to ensure quality assurance and facilitate data capture 
during the study. The system is fully CFR 21 Part 11-compliant and provides for cont rol and 
capture of study operations performance in real time.  
The Investigator or a qualified designee will prepare and maintain adequate and accurate study documents (medical records, ECGs, AE and concomitant medication reporting, raw data 
collection forms, etc.) designed to record all observations and other pertinent data for each patient receiving randomized study drug. The Investigator will ensure the accuracy, 
completeness, and timeliness of the data reported to the Sponsor and will cooperate with the 
Sponsor’s representative(s) for the periodic review of study documents to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the data capture system at each scheduled monitoring visit. Access to all 
source documentation will be made available for monitoring and audit purposes. Monitors will 
conduct 100% source document verification by [CONTACT_341968]. Edit check programs, other forms of electronic validation, manual listings, 
and a query process will be executed to verify the accuracy of the database. The EDC system 
will maintain a full audit trail of electronic data changes. This information will be provided to the site by [CONTACT_25317]. Only enrolled patients will be entered into the database. 
SRK -015-[ADDRESS_423504] be signed and dated by [CONTACT_341969]/IEC in accordance with GCP prior to implementation. In 
addition, the IRB/IEC must approve the written informed consent and assent forms, any consent 
or assent form updates, patient recruitment procedures (e.g., advertisements), and any written information to be provided to patients prior to implementation. The Investigator must provide 
updates to the IRB/IEC with progress reports at appropriate intervals and a Study Progress 
Report following the completion, termination, or discontinuation of the Investigator’s participation in the study. 
15.2. Ethical Conduct of the Study  
The procedures set out in this clinical study protocol are designed to ensure that the Sponsor and the Investigator abide by [CONTACT_341970] (Version 2013). The clinical study will also be carried out in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_341924] (in accordance with US Investigational New Drug regulations 
[21 CFR  56]).  
15.3. Written Informed Consent and Assent  
Written informed consent will be obtained from each patient if the patient is legally an adult. If 
the patient is legally a minor, informe d consent document will be signed by [CONTACT_102]’s parent 
or legal guardian and patient’s oral or written assent obtained, if applicable and in accordance with regulatory and legal requirements of the participating location, before study procedures are conducted. As part of this procedure, the Investigator must explain orally and in writing, the 
nature, duration, and purpose of the study, and the action of the drug in such a manner that the patient and/or their parent or legal guardian is aware of the potential risks, inconveniences, or AEs that may occur. Patients and/or their parents or legal guardians should be informed that they 
are free to withdraw from the study at any time and that they will receive all information that is 
required by [CONTACT_310189]. The Principal Investigat[INVESTIGATOR_1660] [INVESTIGATOR_1660] a qualified designee will provide the Sponsor with a copy of the IRB/IEC-approved ICF prior to the start of the study. 
15.4. Patient Confidentiality  
The anonymity of participating patients must be maintained. Patients will be identified on study documents by [CONTACT_341971] (if allowed based on local data protection 
regulations), not by [CONTACT_2300]. Documents that identify the patient (e.g., the signed informed consent 
document) must be maintained in confidence by [CONTACT_737]. The Investigator agrees not to use or disclose protected health information other than as permitted or required by [CONTACT_341972]. 
SRK -015-[ADDRESS_423505] of this study and the processing of any personal data collected from each patient (or  
from a patient’s healthcar e professional or other relevant third-party sources) by [CONTACT_95346], the site and the Investigator for use in the study will fully adhere to the requirements 
set out in applicable data protection and medical privacy laws or regulations, including, without 
limitation, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) EU 2016/679. Sponsor or designee shall ensure that at all times it has an appropriate legal basis for processing personal data under applicable data protection law. Measures will be implemented in case of data security breach.

documents to verify data represented in the eCRF. 
17.2. Retention of Records  
All source documents (e.g., ICFs, laboratory reports, imaging scans, progress notes, medical 
histories, physical and diagnostic findings, diagnosis and pharmacy records, and study drug 
dispensing/disposition records) that support data in the eCRFs of each study patient must be retained in the files of the responsible Investigator.  
According to ICH guidelines, essential documents should be retained for a minimum of [ADDRESS_423507] not use it 
for other purposes without the Sponsor’s advanced written consent.

Title: A Pragmatic Randomized -controlled 
Trial of a Multi -pronged Electronic Health 
Record -based Clinical Decision Support Tool 
to Reduce Low -value Antipsychotic 
Prescriptions Among Older Adults With 
Alzheimer's and Related Dementias  
 
Study ID: [REMOVED]  
Document Date: August [ADDRESS_1112941] of a quality improvement (QI) 
intervent ion that uses an EHR CDS tool among physicians newly ordering an antipsychotic medication 
for adults with ADRD to increase guideline -concordant prescribing. The study team hypothesizes that 
the intervention will reduce participating clinicians’ pi[INVESTIGATOR_219140] p er patient prescribed.  
Study Design and Setting  
This study design is a pragmatic parallel arm randomized -controlled trial. The study team will randomize 
eligible physicians at UCLA Health, a large academic health system in Los Angeles, Californi a, to be either 
exposed to the EHR CDS tool (intervention) or not (control) in a 1:[ADDRESS_1112942] (IRB) of the University of [LOCATION_004], Los Angeles (UCLA) approved this 
protocol on 01/27/2020 (IRB#19 –002122). The IRB and National Institute on Aging (NIA) Data Safety 
Monitoring Board (DSMB) approved a waiver of informed consent because this tri al is a part of ongoing 
quality and patient safety improvement efforts. In addition, the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_806250] -funded clinical trial and provide them with the trial 
registration link af ter the study has been completed. This study has been registered in ClinicalTrials.gov, 
with trial regist ration identifier: [STUDY_ID_REMOVED].  
The study data containing patient health information will be safeguarded with firewalls and encryption 
following UCLA IRB guidelines, as well as a unique study ID created to protect the identities of patients. 
If successful, UCLA plans to adopt full integration of the EHR CDS tool for all eligible clinicians.  
Methods  
Inclusion Criteria  
Eligible physicians for the EHR CDS tool intervention include ph ysicians who provide ambulatory care in 
the UCLA health system and have generated a new antipsychotic prescription (e.g., Quetiapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], 
Olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], Risperidone, Aripi[INVESTIGATOR_4253], Haloperidol, Clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_050]) for eligible patients (described below) in 
the UCLA health system at least once between 1/1/2019 -4/30/2021 (n = 149). Based on current 
prescribing patterns at UCLA, we estimate that the vast majority of physicians in the study (>75%) will 
only see this EHR CDS tool 1 –[ADDRESS_1112943] encounter with one of the patients during which a new antipsychotic  medication order is initiated.  
Inclusio n criteria for patients will include: 1) having an assigned primary care physician (PCP) and/or 
assignment to an Accountable Care Organization (ACO) at UCLA Health, and 2) being part of the health 
system’s EHR -based dementia registry. The health system’s d ementia registry uses a select group of ICD -
10 codes included in the patient’s problem list to identify patients with ADRD, without age restrictions  
(Table 1) . This ICD -based approach was implemented by [CONTACT_806264] a previously 
publis hed approach 1. To measure the specificity of this method for correctly classifying patients as 
having ADRD, physicians on the study team (board -certified geriatrician, palliative care specialist, and 
primary care general internist) conducted an implici t review (e.g., expert clinician diagnostic judgment)  2 
on a random sample of 30 registry patients; 29 out of 30 (97%) had ADRD.

 ICD-[ADDRESS_1112944] (Table 2). Patients with Parkinson’s di sease on their problem list will also be excluded 
because quetiapi[INVESTIGATOR_806251]’s disease  5. Additionally, because the target for this intervention 
will be new prescriptions, if patients have been prescribed antipsychotics in the prior 12 months, they 
will not be eligible. Eligible encounters will include ambulatory office visits and scheduled telephone and 
video telehealth visits. Emergency department visits, observational stays, and inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_806252].  
Table 2: ICD-[ADDRESS_1112945], a quality officer, informatics specialists, and two behavioral economists. The study 
team previously presented the proposed intervention in an iterative fashion to several stak eholder 
teams including physicians, informaticists, and health system leaders. The final intervention was 
approved by [CONTACT_806265] (which includes patient representation), 
Alert Committee, and the Ambulatory Operations Adviso ry Group.  
The intervention was designed based on a growing body of scientific evidence that multicomponent 
interventions are more likely to succeed than single -component interventio ns to reduce low -value care6. 
The intervention is an EHR CDS tha t will include three components: 1) evidence from Choosing WiselyTM 
guidelines that encourage the clinician to avoid prescribing antipsychotics by [CONTACT_806266]’s desire for non -malfea sance; 2) prompts 
to incorporate IDEA! strategy resources on how caregivers can best manage a patient’s behavioral 
distur bance non -pharmacologically7, which will be available in the EHR to include in the patient’s after 
visit summary; and 3) for physic ians who do not cancel their prescription order, an automatic default to 
a low dosing and low number of pi[INVESTIGATOR_806253] (30 pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382] -days). The study team 
consulted a pharmacist expert (GC) on appropriate defaults for antipsychotics in te rms of dosing, 
frequency, and number of pi[INVESTIGATOR_806254]. For example, currently in the UCLA EHR quetiapi[INVESTIGATOR_806255] 
25 mg by [CONTACT_16629] 90 tabs x 3 refills, totaling 360 pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382] -days. The study team will change the 
default to 25 mg by [CONTACT_16629]  30 tabs with no refills, totaling 30 pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382] -days. Physicians will be free 
to increase amounts as they desire and thus this EHR CDS will not include a “hard stop.” The study team 
opted against the hard stop in acknowledgement of the clinical complexity of th is vulnerable patient 
population and in recognition of the fact that an outright ban on such prescriptions may have 
unintended consequences including but not limited to endangerment of caretakers or cohabitants. The 
EHR CDS tool will fire when the eligible  physician places a new antipsychotic order for an eligible patient. 
Once the CDS tool fires and the physician places the order for either the original dose or a lower dose, 
the patient becomes no longer eligible due to having an active antipsychotic order . Therefore, it will not 
fire for prescription renewals.  
Intervention Implementation  
We designed and pi[INVESTIGATOR_806256],  which is led by [CONTACT_806267]. The CDS tool was also pi[INVESTIGATOR_806257], to assess 
correct activation and smooth functionality. The study team specifically designed the intervention to 
seamlessly fit within the EH R to minimize workflow disruption by [CONTACT_806268], and two clicks if rejecting the intervention in order to 
place the order. All UCLA Health clinicians will be alerted via email (throug h the usual mechanism to 
highlight new EHR tools at UCLA Health System) to the availability of the IDEA! handout that can be used 
for post -visit instructions to support non -pharmaceutical approaches to ADRD behavioral symptoms. 
The study team will pi[INVESTIGATOR_806258]. Just before the onset of the EHR 
intervention, the Principal Investigator (CS, geriatrician) will send a notificati on email to all physicians in 
the intervention arm to “prime” the physicians by [CONTACT_806269], informing them of the upcoming EHR CDS rollout, and 
highlighting non -pharmacologic al ternatives including the IDEA! handout 7. 
Data Collection Methods  
Information sources will include: 1) administrative data found in the UCLA EHR; 2) survey data collected 
from clinicians in the intervention group; and 3) manual medical record  review for patients with ED, 
falls, or death within 90 days of intervention exposure to assess for potential unintended consequences  
Statistical Analysis Plan  
Randomization & Blinding  
A statistician not involved in data collection will rando mize each eligible clinician to the intervention or 
control group; physicians will remain in the same arm of the study throughout the entire study period. 
The randomization of clinicians will be stratified by [CONTACT_806270]: 1 vs. 2 –[ADDRESS_1112946] 
created for this intervention. The study team w ill randomize physicians rather than patients to minimize 
contamination. Contamination occurs when a physician sees a patient in the intervention arm at one 
time point, learns from the intervention that ordering antipsychotic medications is wrong and/or 
difficult, and then avoids prescribing these medications in the future, even when seeing a patient in the 
control arm. Because physicians will on average receive the intervention 1 –2 times during the study 
period, inter -physician contamination will be minima l. Moreover, the CDS tool will only trigger for a new 
antipsychotic order, defined as an antipsychotic prescription for a patient who has not had an active 
antipsychotic prescription within the previous 12 months. This intervention will be implemented as p art 
of a quality improvement effort; clinicians will not be blinded to receiving the intervention.  
Primary Outcome  
The primary outcome will be the cumulative total of new antipsychotic prescription days supplied by 
[CONTACT_806271] i n the 12 months after the intervention rollout date compared to the prior 
12-months, in the intervention versus control groups regardless of the number of visits the provider 
receives.  
Secondary Outcomes  
Secondary outcome measures will be compared between th e intervention and control groups and will 
include the rate of new initiation of antipsychotic medications, patient receipt of the non -pharmacologic 
IDEA! Strategy handout in post -visit patient instruction, emergency department visits, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602] 
(including psychiatric hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]), and death within [ADDRESS_1112947] seen other physicians 
either outside the study or in a different study arm after the initial encounter. The study team will 
examine wh ether the intervention led to any unintended consequences such as substitution of other 
psychotropic medications or reduced time living at home (due to residence in a nursing home or other 
non-home institution). The study team will also survey clinicians’ perceptions of changes in workflow, 
autonomy, satisfaction, and quality of care.  
Statistical Analyses  
The study protocol follows SPI[INVESTIGATOR_806259] . The complete trial protocol can be accessed in the supporting information 
files. Specifically, the study team will report descriptive statistics to characterize the sample of patients 
and clinicians included in the study. The study team will review patient charts to display the time series 
of new antipsychotic prescriptions during the [ADDRESS_1112948] up to 90 days after the completion of 
the trial. The analysis of the primary outcome –total prescription pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382] -days –will utilize a physician -level 
linear regression model, with heteroscedasticity -robust  standard errors, follow ing prior published 
approaches  8. The model will include a fixed effects study arm (intervention vs. control) and baseline 
number of new prescriptions, adjusting for physician -level characteristics including physician gender and 
specialty. Analysis of secondary outcomes will proceed similarly, with the sensitivity analyses using 
different distributions and link functions as appropriate (e.g., a Bernoulli distribution with a logit link for 
the death outcome). To ensure equal consid eration of outcomes among both groups, the study team 
will include 90 -day follow -up for each outcome measure. A p -value of less than 0.05 will be considered 
statistically significant. All analyses will follow the intention -to-treat principle and will be pe rformed 
using SAS v. 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).  
Sample Size  
Power was evaluated using a simulation study. In each simulation, a data set was constructed, 
combining actual prescribing data from mid -[ADDRESS_1112949] previously observed that a small number of 
providers do a large amount of prescribing, and a large number of prescribers do very little prescribing. 
The small number of physicians who are likely to continue their high leve ls of prescribing, leading to high 
correlation. Clinicians were then randomized into intervention and control arms, with the intervention 
arm’s number of pi[INVESTIGATOR_806260] a constant amount. A linear regression of year 2’s number of pi[INVESTIGATOR_806261] 1’s number of pi[INVESTIGATOR_806262]. Heteroskedasticity -robust 
standard errors were used to compute p -values. Significance was defined as a p -value less than 0.[ADDRESS_1112950] in the model, and power was estima ted as the percentage of simulations 
in which a significant difference was obtained. We performed 10,000 simulations to estimate power. 
Based on historical data, we estimate that about 65% of physicians included in our randomization list 
will see an eligib le patient during the study period. We thus expect our analytic sample to include data 
from [ADDRESS_1112951] 80% power to detect a 
mean reduction of 108 pi[INVESTIGATOR_219140], which is feasible. This simulation pow er analysis was performed using R 
v. 3.6.2 (http://www.r -project.org/).

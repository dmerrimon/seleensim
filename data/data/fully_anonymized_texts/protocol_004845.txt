Brief Summary of Research (250-400 words): 
We propose to enable oncologist and their patients with advanced cancer to have a Goals of 
Care (GoC) discussion. To achieve this and ensure that we capture patients’ experiences and 
preferences, we have recruited stakeholders representing cancer patients and providers 
experienced in the challenges faced by [CONTACT_322007]. Patient stakeholders will 
be invited to participate in team meetings to provide their insights to: inform our tools, study 
design and aid with interpretation of the findings. Our goal is to develop approaches that 
enable GoC discussions to occur that are effective in different practice settings. Toward that 
end, we have recruited a tertiary referral, community and municipal hospi[INVESTIGATOR_611711]. All serve inner city populations but their structures, organizational characteristics & 
supports differ. We will assess the feasibility of conducting GoC discussions and explore the 
cultural and experiential differences in practice. We will train oncologist to conduct GoC using 
Oncotalk and 4 joint visits and an Oncotalk trainer-palliative care physician.  
1) Objectives: 
Aim 1: Describe patients’ perspectives about GoC discussions & oncologists’ perspectives 
about barriers & facilitators of GoC discussions. 
Aim 2: Determine the efficacy of the innovation of joint oncologist-palliative care 
communication training in real life settings to improve communication skills and assess its 
feasibility. 
Aim 3: Block randomize oncologists in a municipal, 3ary referral and community hospi[INVESTIGATOR_611712]- joint Pall Care-Oncologist GoC visit & assess the effects on patient 
perceived and experienced quality of care.

a) Recruitment Methods 
Pre-Intervention Interviews 
At each site, we will work with a research assistant to identify eligible patients with 
advanced cancer (primary stage IV hepatobiliary, esophageal, colorectal, glioblastoma, 
gastric, pancreatic, melanoma, head & neck, kidney, bladder, liver or locally advanced 
stage IIIor IV  lung) for pre-intervention interviews. We aim to recruit [ADDRESS_811167] varied representation across different:  
age groups, cancers, and number of treatments. We will also recruit Spanish & Chinese 
speaking patients to be able to capture cultural differences.  We will require research 
assistants at each site with the aid of the site PI, to review pathology and the EHR record 
in order to identify eligible patients.  Once eligible patients are identified, they will be

Recruit Oncologists: We will obtain a list of oncologists who treat the aforementioned 
advanced cancers from the Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology at each 
participating hospi[INVESTIGATOR_611715]’s PIs and oncology leadership.  We will 
recruit the eligible oncologists to participate in this study by [CONTACT_611730] .  Site PIs know and 
work closely with key personnel needed for this project to succeed, pathologists, 
radiologists, nurses, clerical & administrative personnel. We will recruit and consent 
oncologists who see at least 2 new advanced cancer patients per month to participate.   
Patient Identification for the Intervention: At each site, we will work with a research 
assistant to identify eligible patients with advanced cancer (primary stage IV 
hepatobiliary, esophageal, colorectal, glioblastoma, gastric, pancreatic, melanoma, head & 
neck, kidney, bladder, castrate resistant prostate cancer, liver or locally advanced stage III 
or IV lung). We aim to recruit [ADDRESS_811169] explaining the study. Site research assistants will identify 
eligible patients’ upcoming oncology visits. Patients will be approached by [CONTACT_611731], proceed with the 
consent process. Research assistants at Mount Sinai will consent and survey patients at the 
sites.  Keepi[INVESTIGATOR_611716].  Patients may be surveyed at the local hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600], 
clinic or via telephone, whichever is more convenient for patients. 
b) Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria 
Inclusion Criteria: Men or women who are at least [ADDRESS_811170] an average of <2 y 
life expectancy (primary stage IV hepatobiliary, esophageal, colorectal, glioblastoma, 
gastric, pancreatic, melanoma, head & neck, kidney, bladder,  castrate resistant prostate

Revised  9/2/14 Exclusion criteria: We will exclude patients who have seen an oncologist after undergoing 
first line treatment imaging as this group has a higher likelihood of having received a 
goals of care discussion. Men or women who do not speak English or Spanish will be 
excluded. 
c) Number of Subjects 
30 pre-intervention patient interviews; [ADDRESS_811171] interviews; 315 patients for 
intervention (see table with breakdown of intervention patients below).  Given the high 
number of screen failures, we had to increase the number of consented patients to [ADDRESS_811172] 25 
oncologists to be recruited across the 4 sites.  However, this number may differ given that 
there is constant turnover in physicians at each of the sites and actual number of 
oncologists will not be determined until the study has begun.

e) Study Endpoints 
Primary endpoints are patient’s perceptions that goals of care discussions occurred and 
patient’s satisfaction with the discussion.  Secondary outcomes include patients’ 
perspectives about goals of care discussions & oncologists’ perspectives about barriers & 
facilitators of goals of care discussions.  We will evaluate change in oncologist’s 
communication skills and assess feasibility of the intervention.   In addition, we will 
assess healthcare utilization at the end of life and whether goals of care led to care in line 
with patient preferences.

Revised  9/2/[ADDRESS_811175] pre-intervention interviews 
with oncologists and patients.    To  obtain experiences and perspectives on goals of care 
discussions, including barriers and facilitators of these discussions and the influence of 
organizational culture on goals of care discussions w e will recruit 20 oncologists across 
the 4 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_129372] (Beth Israel, Kings County, Mount Sinai, Yale) for a 30 minute 
audiotaped interview and survey.  We will briefly survey oncologists about 
communication skills training experience & comfort conducting goals of care discussions.  
In addition, we will assess all oncologists’ baseline communication skills by [CONTACT_105114][INVESTIGATOR_611720].  
 
We will also recruit [ADDRESS_811176], patient/family concerns, cultural beliefs, and preferences. 
 
Intervention Phase 
Oncologist Participation 
For the intervention phase of the study, we will work with each site’s PI [INVESTIGATOR_611721] a list of oncologists treating at least [ADDRESS_811177] line 
treatment.  Oncologists will be randomized to the intervention or usual care group.   
 
Intervention oncologists will receive a two hour basic training; first hour focuses on 
practicing skills of goals of care discussions; the second hour focusing on choreographing 
joint consultants with the Palliative Care specialist trained in Oncotalk facilitation. We 
will conduct a total of [ADDRESS_811178] will review the “choreography” of that visit – which physician 
will cover specified elements of the GoC talk, reinforcing the 2h role play session. We 
envision that during the initial joint visit, the oncologist will cover the Knowledge portion 
and the palliative care specialist, the remainder, thus modeling how to approach the more 
difficult parts of the conversation. With each successive session, additional portions will 
be led by [CONTACT_611732] 4th joint consult, most, if not all the session will be led

Revised  9/2/[ADDRESS_811179]-visit assessment & feedback.  During each joint consult, the palliative 
care specialist will complete a checklist of skills performed. Immediately following each 
joint consult, the palliative care specialist will review with the oncologist the GoC areas 
performed, what went well, and together, plan corrective approaches for the next session. 
The pre- and post-visit planning & feedback times are based on prior OncoTalk feedback 
assessments.  
At 12-months or after the OncoTalk training for intervention oncologists, all oncologists 
will have an audiotaped patient visit to assess changes in goals of care discussions. 
 
Patient Participation  
We will work with the research assistant at each site to identify patients using the EHR.  
Once eligibility has been determined, patients will be contact[CONTACT_61936] a letter from their 
treating oncologist explaining the study and informing them that a research team member 
will be contact[CONTACT_3018]. Patients will be approached by [CONTACT_611733], proceed with consent 
process.  This consent will be done in person.  Once the patient has been consented, the 
research assistant will contact [CONTACT_611734] a [ADDRESS_811180] visit (which 
we will ask to audiotape) or over the telephone whichever is more convenient for the 
patient.  Baseline survey will assess whether goals of care discussion took place, their 
satisfaction with the discussion and whether the discussion helped them identify their 
preferences in care. Audiotape will confirm conduct of a goals of care discussion.  The 
patients will be surveyed 6 months after the baseline survey either in person or over the 
phone.  Six months later, patients (if alive) or their caregivers will be surveyed to assess 
whether the care received was in line with their preferences and determine hospi[INVESTIGATOR_611722].  In the event, the patient is deceased, we will call the 
caregiver and ask them if they are willing to participate, consent him/her and conduct 
survey over the phone or at a place convenient to them.  We will conduct a chart review of 
consented patient’s records to determine treatments received for their cancer. 
 
Post-Data Collection Phase  
Oncologist Participation 
We will interview the same intervention oncologists that had been enrolled in the study at 
post-intervention using a semi-structured  survey to obtain feedback about the 
Communication Skills Training to understand what they got from the training and whether 
they used the skills obtained.

h) Data Management and Confidentiality 
We will be collecting advanced cancer patients’ treatment information and physician 
interviews . All study personnel are instructed on proper confidentiality and data 
safeguarding procedures.  Data will be stored on a secure password protected computer 
maintained by [CONTACT_611735].  Any hard copy materials will be 
maintained in locked cabinets when they are not in use.  Study subjects are assigned 
unique identification numbers and we will strip the files of identifiers once data analysis is 
complete.  We will remove names, addresses and other direct identifiers from hardcopy 
and computer readable data after they are not necessary for patient and physician tracking, 
and we will use an encrypted link file for subsequent identification of patients and 
physicians. The research assistant will place the audio recorder in the clinic room and 
collect the recorder at the end of the visit. The research assistant will not be present in the 
room during the visit.  We will ensure that all patient audio recordings do not contain any 
personal identifiers and they will be stored with unique identifiers for analysis purposes.  
Once data analysis is complete the recordings will be deleted .  The recordings will be 
stored in a password protected computer maintained by [CONTACT_611736].  We will ensure that all communication contain no confidential information 
and will only refer to participants using their unique study number. The Principal 
Investigator, Project Manager, Data Analyst, Chart Abstractor and Research Assistants 
will have access to the data base. 
i) Provisions to Monitor the Data to Ensure the Safety of subjects 
We will follow the basic DSMP procedures. 
j) Withdrawal of Subjects 
This s
tudy involves chart review, communication of GoC training for oncologists, 
oncologist and patient interviews and surveys. No treatment will be administered to study 
subjects. If participants ask to withdraw from the study, we will only use the information 
that has already been collected.  
6) Risks to Subjects 
This study involves training, interviews and surveys.  Minimal risk is involved. The only 
foreseeable risk is that questions asked during the interview might make the patients or 
oncologists uncomfortable. We will reiterate that they can refuse to answer any questions they 
wish. Patients who appear psychologically distressed will be promptly reported to Drs. Smith 
and Bickell.

There is no direct benefit for participants for taking part in the study. 
9) Provisions to Protect the Privacy Interests of Subjects 
We will only reach out to patients after initial contact [CONTACT_611737] a letter. 
We will speak with the patients when they appear at their scheduled appointment to discuss 
the study and if interested initiate consent process. We will ensure that all communication  
among the study team contain no confidential information and will only refer to participants 
using their unique study number. 
 
10) Economic Impact on Subjects 
There are no costs directly associated with participation in this study. 
11) Payment to Subjects 
In this research study, oncologists were given a $50 incentive for interviews, pre-intervention 
patients received $40, and intervention study patients received $80 for their participation in 
the study. 
12) Consent Process 
We propose to obtain standard written consent from the participants across all sites.  
Consent will be obtained by [CONTACT_611738]. We will be following the informed consent process for research as indicated in SOP 
HRP-090.   We will consent Spanish & Chinese speaking patients using the Spanish & 
Chinese approved standard consent forms as appropriate. In the event that the subject is 
deceased and their caregiver will be interviewed instead, we will attempt to set up an in-
person meeting with the caregiver. If consent and the interview must take place by 
[CONTACT_756], we will contact [CONTACT_611739] a copy of the caregiver 
consent form, either by [CONTACT_611740]. After he or she has had a chance to review the 
consent form, the informed consent process will take place over the telephone. The signed 
consent form will be mailed back to the study team by [CONTACT_18629]. 
 
Waiver or Alteration of the Consent Process for Review of Pathology Reports and 
Electronic Health Record in Preparation for Research 
 
We request a waiver of informed consent to identify eligible patients via electronic health 
record and scheduling systems.  Once eligibility is determined we will consent patients 
into the study.  The use of PHI will be minimal and will only be used to identify eligible

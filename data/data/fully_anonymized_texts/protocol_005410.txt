EN3835-210 Protocol Amendment 4
22 October 2021 Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 2PROTOCOL AMENDMENT SUMMARY OF CHANGES
Overall Rationale for Amendment 4:
The primary purpose of this amendment was to increase the total number of subjects for the 
study to [ADDRESS_528756] 
the increase in total number of 
subjects.
Section1.1Synopsis 
AND
Section4.1Overall Study 
Design AND
Section9.1Sample Size 
Determination Total number of subjects for the 
study increased from 160 to 180.Due to a higher than expected 
early termination rate, sample size 
was increased to 180 subjects.
Section1.1Synopsis 
AND
Section9.4Interim AnalysisSpecified the total number of 
subjects (86) who must have 
completed the Day 95/Early Termination (ET) Visit before interim analysis can be performed. Total number of subjects for interim analysis was 86.
Section1.2Schedule of 
ActivitiesSchedule of Activities Footnote b 
changed to: Treatment sessions 
should be at least [ADDRESS_528757] Inclusion 
Criteria, Criterion#[ADDRESS_528758]. Specified that 
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (ibuprofen, etc) 
and Tylenol (acetaminophen) are 
allowed.Barbiturates and benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_419320] (MRI) scans.
Section5.2Subject Exclusion 
Criteria, Criterion#5, 4th bulletOriginal Text: Uncontrolled 
thyroid disease defined as thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) 
≥4 uIU/mL at the Screening Visit.
Note added: (Note: Uncontrolled 
thyroid disease is defined as a symptomatic medical condition not 
adequately controlled with 
medications.)This change was made to clarify 
the definition of uncontrolled 
thyroid disease. 
Section7.2Subject 
Withdrawal from the StudyRewritten to clarify the difference 
between subject discontinuation 
and subject withdrawal of consent.Procedures performed after subject 
discontinuation and subject 
withdrawal of consent were 
clarified.
Overall Rationale for Amendment 3:
The primary purpose of this amend ment was to clarify exclusion criteria regarding related to 
coagulation and bleeding disorders. In addition, the unit of measure for TSH was updated to 
reflect current practice. Furthermore, the storage of injection site photographs was defined. Photographs are to be stored in a database and not in the subject source documents. Text to 
clarify exclusion criterion #[ADDRESS_528759] Exclusion 
Criteria, Criterion #3Changed from:
Has any abnormalities/conditions in the affected shoulder that would 
be clinically significant or potentially confounding to the 
evaluations of safety and efficacy 
as determined by [CONTACT_419343]:This change was made to remove 
responsibility from the investigators and to allow the MRI 
committee to determine eligibility based on their MRI grading criteria to ensure consistency.
Changed to:
Has any abnormalities/conditions 
in the affected shoulder that would be potentially confounding to the 
evaluations of efficacy as 
determined by [CONTACT_419344]. 
The shoulder pathologies to be 
assessed include but are not 
limited to the following:
Section5.2Subject Exclusion 
Criteria, Criterion #5Criterion #5, 2 bullet points were 
removed including:
‘Coagulation disorder’
and
‘A known bleeding disorder which, in the investigator’s 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], would make the subject 
unsuitable for enrollment in the 
study.’Bullet points were removed from 
Exclusion Criteria #5 to be 
included in the revised Exclusion Criteria #7 for clarity.
In addition, the unit of measure 
for TSH was changed from U/mL 
to uIU/mL.To align with current practice.

EN3835-[ADDRESS_528760] Exclusion 
Criteria, Criterion #7Criterion #7 changed from: 
Requires anticoagulant or antiplatelet medication or has 
received anticoagulant or antiplatelet medication (except 
≤150 mg aspi[INVESTIGATOR_34223]) within 
[ADDRESS_528761] injection 
of study treatment.
To:
Has a known coagulation disorder 
and/ or is taking any medication 
(ie, anticoagulants or antiplatelet medications, except for ≤ 150 mg 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_34223]) that would increase the risk of bleeding within [ADDRESS_528762] injection of EN3835 and for the duration of the study. Revised language for 
Coagulation/Bleeding disorders for clarity and to be more 
consistent with other ongoing 
studies.
Section5.4Screen Failures Updated to:
Subjects will be allowed to repeat 
hematology, serum chemistry, 
urinalysis, or vital signs once, if necessary, if it is within the screening window.Vital signs were added to the list 
of assessments to be repeated if 
the subject is retested.
Section6.1Study Treatment 
AdministrationUpdated to:
‘A screen capture/photograph of the injection will be taken at each 
injection visit and retained withina database until the end of the study.’Modified to reflect the location of archived images.
Overall Rationale for Amendment 2:
The primary purpose of this amendment was to clarify which pain medication would be 
considered exclusionary for the study, and to add clarity to the exclusion criteria or MRI 
contraindications for exclusion criterion #[ADDRESS_528763] Inclusion 
Criteria, Criterion #2
and
Section6.5.1Prohibited 
Medications and Nondrug 
Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_419321] #[ADDRESS_528764] Exclusion 
Criteria, Criterion #3Criterion #3 modified to add the 
exclusion of abnormalities/ 
conditions in the affected shoulder 
that would affect the evaluation of safety or efficacy evaluations.Modified to clarify that conditions 
of the affected shoulder that are 
deemed clinically significant by [CONTACT_419345].
Section5.2Subject Exclusion 
Criteria, Criterion #6Exclusion criterion #6 changed to: 
Has any of the following 
contraindications for MRI, as determined by [CONTACT_3433] e technologist, 
the radiologist, and/or the investigator (in accordance with the MHRA Safety Guidelines for 
Magnetic Resonance Imaging 
Equipment in Clinical Use, 
March2015):
Note changed to: Any tattoo in the 
treated area will be exclusionary.Modified to clarify that the 
technologist, radiologist, and 
investigator will determine subject eligibility for MRI, and that a 
tattoo in the treated area would 
exclude the subject from receiving 
and MRI.
Section8.1.7Magnetic 
Resonance ImagingAdded: A central MRI committee 
consisting of 2 blinded musculoskeletal radiologists who 
will serve as the primary readers and 1 blinded clinician who will serve as the adjudicator in discordant cases.Text added to define the central MRI committee.
Overall Rationale for Amendment 1:
The primary purpose of this amendment was to align exclusion criteria on other shoulder 
pathologies seen on MRI with our MRI vendor to provide clarity and alignment for the MRI 
readers. The change was to clarify both the schedule of activities (SoA) and procedures detailed in the protocol. The other major reason for this amendment is to modify the protocol due to the potential interruption caused by [CONTACT_25963]-[ADDRESS_528765] of clinical research throughout the world. At Endo 
Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Endo), ensuring the safety of clinical study subjects is our primary 
concern. In addition, the inte grity of data obtained from clin ical trials must be ensured. 
In order to ensure subject safety and protect data integrity, Endo, in accordance with the FDA 
Guidance on Conduct of Clinical Trials of Medical Products during COVID-19 Public Health Emergency (March 2020, updated 02 July 2020), will allow virtual visits for safety assessments. 
In addition, subjects impacted by [CONTACT_419346]3835-210 Protocol Amendment 4
22 October 2021 Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 7and complete remaining dosing and assessmentswhen the investigational sites re-open as 
follows:
!Subjects who were in screening (those who had completed or were in the process ofscreening) for the study at the time of the COVID-[ADDRESS_528766] rescreens within 30 days oftheir original screening MRI date and adhesive capsulitis (AC) was confirmed in the
affected shoulder by [CONTACT_419347], and the unaffected shoulder
MRI was unremarkable, the subject will not need to have a repeat MRI of eithershoulder. Other adhesive capsulitis s houlder scr eening assessments will be
determined on a case by [CONTACT_419348]. All repeat screening assessments must be completed within the screeningwindow.
Minor changes throughout the protocol amendment included wording changes for clarit y and 
correction of minor typographical errors.
Amendment 1 was incorporated into the protocol on 10 July 2020.

EN3835-[ADDRESS_528785] compri sed of 2 collagenases in an approximate 
1:1 mass ratio, Collagenase I (Clostridial class I collagenase [AUX-I]) and Collagenase II 
(Clostridial class II collagenase [AUX-II]). EN3835 (XIAFLEX®) is currently approved for use 
in adult patients with Dupuytren’s contracture (DC) with a palpable cord and for the treatment of 
adult men with Peyronie’s disease (PD) with a palpable plaque and curvature deformity of at 
least 30 degrees at the start of therapy.
2.1. Study Rationale
The histopathology of adhesive capsulitis (AC) bears similarities to that seen in Dupuytren’s 
contracture ( Bunker and Anthony, 1995 ; Bunker et al, 2000 ; Rodeo et al, 1997 ; Tamai et al, 
2014) with:
!An initial phase of synovial hyperplasia that progresses to fibrosis of the synovium
and capsule, likely the result of increased fibroblast activity and cellular proliferation.
!New and excessive collagen deposition within the capsule likely the result ofincreased expression of multiple pro-inflammatory cytokines.
!A residual stage in which fibroblast activity is diminished and reduced collagenmaturation and remodeling take place, culminating in a protracted stiffening of thecapsule.
Therefore, DC treatments such as EN3835 may be effective in other collagen mediated conditions such as AC. Based on the limitations of currently available treatments; there is an unmet need for a less invasive, cost effective treatment option that reduces the burden of illness 
due to AC. 
The COVID-[ADDRESS_528786] of clinical research 
throughout the world. At Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Endo), ensuring the safety of clinical study 
subjects is our primary concern. In addition, th e integrity of data obtained from clinical trials 
must be ensured.
In order to ensure subject safety and protect data integrity, Endo, in accordance with the FDA 
Guidance on Conduct of Clinical Trials of Medical Products during COVID-19 Public Health 
Emergency (March 2020, updated 02 July 2020), will allow virtual visits for safety assessments. 
In addition, subjects impacted by [CONTACT_419352]-open as 
follows:
!Subjects who were in screening (those who had completed or were in the process ofscreening) for the study at the time of the COVID-[ADDRESS_528787] be completed within the screening 
window. 
2.2. Background
EN3835, marketed as XIAFLEX, is currently approved for use in adults with DC and PD. These 
collagenases are proteinases that hydrolyze collagen in its native triple helical conformation under physiological conditions, which may result in lysis of collagen deposits in a Dupuytren’s 
cord and/or Pey ronie’s plaque.
Adescription of the chemistry, pharmacology, efficacy, and safety of EN3835 is provided in the Investigators Brochure ( Endo, 2020 ). 
AC is a prolonged, painful condition of the shoulder that is associated with loss of range of 
motion (ROM) in the glenohumeral joint. An American Shoulder and Elbow Society (ASES) 
consensus definition of AC is: “a condition characterized by [CONTACT_419353]” ( Zuckerman and Rokito, 2011 ).
Management of AC is controversial and depends on the phase of the disease. Decision making is often based on quality of life and whether the patients are able to cope with the pain and/or stiffness until its eventual resolution. Treatment options include a range of conservative and 
surgical measures.
Both oral and intra-articular corticosteroids have been shown to have a benefit in reducing pain 
and increasing ROM in AC, but these benefits are short-lived and there are significant risks 
associated with long term systemic steroid use ( Buchbinder et al, 2004 ; Buchbinder et al, 2006 ; 
Canbulat et al, 2015 ; Carette et al, 2003 ; Lorbach et al, 2010 ; Takase, 2010 ; Yoon et al, 2013 ).
Physical therapy (PT) to the limit of pain is widely accepted as part of the management of AC, at least in the early stages of the disease where it is thought to reduce pain and increase ROM 
(D’Orsi et al, 2012 ; Jain and Sharm, 2014 ; Russell et al, 2014 ; Struyf and Meeus, 2014 ; Wilson 
et al, 2015 ).
O’Kane et al (1999) reported that patients treated with home exercise alone improved in a 
self-assessed shoulder rating system, physical function, and pain after an average of 25 months of follow-up; however, 30% to 40% of these patients could not place an [ADDRESS_528788] at their side.
Studies of treatment with suprascapular ne rve blocks, intra-articular hyaluronic acid, 
intra-articular injection of botulism toxin type A, hydrodilation (also known as distention 
arthrography), and manipulation under anesthesia (MUA) have found little difference in pain or 
ROM between these therapi[INVESTIGATOR_419327]-articular corticosteroids and/or PT (Corbeil et al, 1992 ;Dahan et al, 2000 ; De Carli et al, 2012 ;Gam et al, 1998 ;Harris et al, 2011 ;
Jacobs et al, 1991 ;Jones and Chattopadhyay, 1999 ;Joo et al, 2013 ).
More recent nonrandomized studies have indicated that there may be some long term benefit to 
hydrodilation compared to corticosteroids ( Ahn et al, 2015 )or MUA( Clement et al, 2013 ; 
Simpson and Budge, 2004 ; Watson and Dalziel, 2000 ). However, there are significant risks 
associated with both procedures ( D’Orsi et al, 2012 ; Loew et al, 2005 ; Magnussen and Taylor, 

EN3835-210 Protocol Amendment 4
22 October 2021 Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 232011; Redler and Dennis, 2019 ; Vastamäki and Vastamäki, 2013 ). Complications from MUA 
include humeral fracture, subscapularis rupture, labral tears, and injury to the biceps tendon 
(Jacobs et al, 1991 ; Jacobs et al, 2009 ).
Arthroscopic capsular release has been used to treat AC effectively, particularly in patients who 
have been unresponsive to other treatments, by [CONTACT_419354]; however, risks 
associated with this procedure include postoperative pain, postoperative AC, and axillary nerve 
damage, as well as the risks associated with general anesthesia ( Baums et al, 2007 ; Jerosch et al, 
2013; Le Lievre and Murrell, 2012 ; Smith et al, 2014 ; Walther et al, 2014; Watsonet al, 2007 ).
AC remains a disease that is difficult to diagnose and there is little consensus in the literature 
regarding preferred treatment or the preferred time for treatment ( D’Orsi et al, 2012 ; 
Georgiannos et al, 2017 ; Hannafin and Chiaia, 2000 ; Le et al, 2017 ; Manske and Prohaska, 2008 ; 
Nagy et al, 2013 ; Stupay and Neviaser, 2015 ). 
Three clinical studies with EN3835 have been conducted to date and results are outlined in Section2.3, Section 4.2, and Section 4.3. Detailed information about these studies can be found 
in the Investigator’s Brochure ( Endo, 2020 ).
2.3. Benefit/Risk Assessment
Although a thorough benefit of EN3835 has not been fully established in the treatment of AC, the post hoc analyses from the previous phase 2b study (AUX-CC-871) and previous AC studies 
indicate that EN3835 should be further explored as a treatment. In addition, the lack of 
consensus regarding treatment of AC and the risks associated with surgical or drug treatment or with long-term corticosteroid use suggest that safe and effective treatments for this condition are 
needed.
In the most recent study of EN3835 in  AC (AUX-CC-871), the most common ( ≥ 5% of subjects) 
treatment-related, treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were musculoskeletal pain 
(34.2%), contusion (28.7%), in jection site pain (21.1%), ecchymosis (19.8%), injection site 
bruising (19.4%), localized edema (8.0%), and pruritus (5.1%). These events are similar to 
events reported in the clinical trials of EN3835 for the approved indications, and postmarketing 
safety data are consistent with the safety data reported in clinical trials. 
Use caution when administering EN3835 so as not to inject intra-articularly. A single animal 
study indicated significant adverse events associated with intra-articular injection of EN3835. 
While the effect in humans is not known, intra-articular injection (misapplication) of EN3835 
during treatment of AC must be avoided.
More information about the known and expected benefit, risks, and reasonably expected adverse 
events (AEs) can be found in the Investigator’s Brochure ( Endo, 2020 ).
Risks associated with the use of a local anesthetic include bruising, pain, tingling, blurred vision, 
dizziness, headache, muscle twitching, weakness, and continuing numbness. Local anesthetics 
can sometimes cause allergic reactions including hives, itching, and difficulty breathing. In rare 
cases, cyanosis can occur at the site of injection; and very rarely, use of a local anesthetic can lead to depressed central nervous system syndrome.

EN3835-210 Protocol Amendment 4
22 October 2021 Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 24The baseline shoulder X-ray exposes subjects to  a very low level of radiation. Extensive 
exposure to radiation can lead to cancer. Exposure to any radiation can harm an unborn fetus in a 
pregnant woman.
Risks associated with ultrasound are rare; however, subjects undergoing ultrasound may 
experience slight heating of tissues and the creation of cavitations (small pockets of gas) within 
the body. The long term effects of these events are unknown.
Due to the use of the strong magnet, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) cannot be performed on 
subjects with any implant containing metal or those who have other internal or external metallic 
objects as it may cause these objects to move. 
All other procedures and activities in this study are generally accepted as standard of care for 
patients with AC and do not present any increased risk to the subjects.

4.2. Scientific Rationale for the Study Design
A placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-arm study design was chosen in accordance with the FDA Guidance for Industry, E 10 Choice of Control Group and Related Issues in Clinical Trials . 
The use of a placebo control helps to prevent subjects from automatically thinking that all effects 
they experience are attributable to the active treatment since there is a 50% chance they are 
actually receiving inactive injection (placebo). In addition, no active control is used because 
there are no generally accepted pharmacologic tr eatments for AC.
4.3. Justification for Dose
In a dose ranging study (AUX-CC-870) of EN3835 in AC, doses of 0.58 mg (at volumes of 
0.5 mL, 1 mL, and 2 mL) were well tolerated with most TEAEs occurring at the site of injection 
with a profile consistent with that observed in previous clinical trials of EN3835 in the treatment of DC and PD. Statist ically significant improvements from baseline in AROM forward flexion, 
ASES composite score, and ASES pain and function subscale scores were seen at doses of 0.58 mg/1 mL and 0.58 mg/2 mL compared to a home exercise alone group. In addition, the dose of 0.58 mg/[ADDRESS_528790] 
flexion, PROM abduction, and PROM external ro tation compared to the home exercise alone 
group. The dose of EN3835 0.58mg/1 mL was equally well tolerated in the AUX-CC-871 study where results similar to those for AUX-CC-870 were observed. Based on these results, the 
EN3835 0.58 mg/1 mL dose was selected for the AC clinical development program.
4.4. Justification for Magnetic Resonance Imaging
The diagnosis of AC is difficult to make on the basis of clinical findings and is usually a diagnosis of exclusion as other causes of shoulder pain and stiffness such as rotator cuff tear, 
impi[INVESTIGATOR_20798], calcific tendinitis, or osteoarthritis may mimic AC. Arthrography, ultrasonography, and MRI play an important role in identifying AC ( Hsu et al, 2011 ; 
Zappia et al, 2016 ). 
Arthrography is not an optimal diagnostic tool for routine AC diagnosis as it is invasive and cannot be used to observe changes such as inflammation, thickening, or fibrosis in the 
glenohumeral joint capsule and synovium. While ultrasonography may aid in the diagnosis of 
AC, its role is still controversial ( Zappia et al, 2016 ).
MRI is a noninvasive diagnostic tool that has b een commonly used to help differentiate 
underlying disease that can mask the symptoms of AC ( Hsu et al, 2011 ). MRI is capable of 
diagnosing AC early and can rule out confounding pathology through reliable imaging indicators including thickening of the CHL, the joint capsule in the rotator interval and axillary recess, as 
well as obliteration of the fat triangle under the coracoid process ( Connell et al, 2002 ; Emig et al, 
1995; Gokalp et al, 2011 ; Harris et al, 2013 ; Jung et al, 2006 ; Mengiardi et al, 2004 ; Sofka et al, 
2008; Song et al, 2011).

refrain from doing pushups, pull-ups, taking spin classes, and swimming. Purses should not be 
carried on the treated side.
Subjects who are avid exercisers may do lower body workouts that do not involve the arms 
and/or shoulders keepi[INVESTIGATOR_419330] (see Section 5.1, Item 9). General 
stationary bike and treadmill walking are acceptable forms of cardiovascular strength training;

storage, and accountability of study treatment.
6.3. Measures to Minimize Bias
Subjects will be randomized according to a validated computer-generated allocation scheme to 
receive the study treatment described above in a 1:1 ratio using an interactive response 
technology (IRT) system. Subjects, investigators, site personnel, and Endo personnel (except 
clinical supplies personnel) will be blinded to treatment assignment. 
6.3.1. Interactive Response Technology
The investigator or designee will utilize an IRT system to register subjects at screening. Each 
subject’s unique identification number (ID) will be assigned by [CONTACT_419357]. If the 
subject is not eligible to receive study treatmen t, or should withdraw from the study, the ID 
number will not be reassigned to another subject. Specific instructions for the use of the IRT 
system will be included in the Pharmacy Manual. 
The investigator must maintain a subject master log linking the subject ID to the subject’s name. 
The investigator must follow all applicable priv acy laws in order to protect a subject’s privacy 
and confidentiality. Information that could identify a subject must be masked on material received by [CONTACT_456].
6.3.2. Emergency Identification of Study Treatment
The blind may be broken if, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], it is in the subject’s best interest 
for the investigator to know the study treatment assignment. The sponsor must be notified before the blind is broken unless identification of the study treatment is required for a medical 
emergency in which the knowledge of the specific blinded study treatment will affect the 
immediate management of the subject’s condition. In th is case, the sponsor must be notified 

EN3835-[ADDRESS_528802] visit. Study tr eatment inventory will be 
maintained in the IRT system, and all original c ontainers of used and unused study tr eatment and 
diluent will be returned to the sponsor (or designee) at the end of the study. 
Accidental or intentional overdoses should be reported to the sponsor/designee promptly (see 
Section8.4).

SUBJECT WITHDRAWAL
7.1. Discontinuation of Study Treatment
Subjects who discontinue study treatment for any reason, will be encouraged to complete the 
remaining study visits and evaluations and provide any additional follow-up information as 
required by [CONTACT_1758], unless the subject specifically indicates that they will not participate in any further evaluations. The date ofand reason for study tr eatment discontinuation  will be recorded.
Permanent study treatment discontinuation is required if:
!The subject becomes pregnant during the study.
!Discontinuation of study treatment for abnorm al liver function should be considered
by [CONTACT_82378] a subject meets the conditions outlined in Section 10.6.
!If a clinically significant cardiac finding is identified (including but not limited tochanges from baseline in QTc after the start of study treatment), the investigator in
consultation with the medical monitor will d etermine if the subject can continue in
the study and if any change in management is needed.
Subjects who discontinue from study tr eatment at any time after the firs t dose of study  treatment 
will not be replaced.
7.2. Subject Withdrawal from the Study
Subjects may withdraw from the study at any time at their own request, or may be withdrawn at 
any time at the discretion of the investigator for safety, behavioral, compliance, or administrative reasons. The date of withdrawal and the reason for withdrawal will be recorded.
If the subject withdraws consent for disclosure of future information, the sponsor may retain and 
continue to use any data collected before such withdrawal of consent. If a subject withdraws 
from the study, the subject may request destruction of any biological samples taken and not yet 
tested. The investigator must document this in the site study records.

EN3835-[ADDRESS_528804] may be discontinued from the study for the following medical or administrative 
reasons:  
• Withdrawal by [CONTACT_1130] (reason must be specified).

• The subject was lost to follow-up.  
• Other reasons (reason must be specified, for example: the subject moved, pregnancy, investigator decision, sponsor decision to terminate trial, etc).  
If a subject discontinues from the study, all early termination procedures should be conducted as 
detailed in the Schedule of Activities. The date a subject discontinues and the reason for discontinuation will be recorded in the source documentation and electronic case report form (eCRF). If, however, a subject withdraws consent, no additional procedures are required. This 
information should be recorded in the source documentation and the eCRF. 
7.3. Lost to Follow -up 
A subject will be considered lost to follow -up if the subject repeated ly fails to return for 
scheduled visits and is unable to be contact[CONTACT_9298]. 
The following actions must be taken if a subject fails to return for a required study visit: 
• The site must attempt to contact [CONTACT_419358]/or should continue in the study. 
• Before a subject is deemed lost to follow -up, the investigator or designee must make 
every effort to regain contact [CONTACT_1155] (where possible, [ADDRESS_528805]’s last known mailing address; or local 
equivalent methods). These attempts will be documented. 
• Should the subject continue to be unreachable, the subject will be considered to have 
withdrawn from the study. 
Subjects who have been lost to follow- up at any time after the first dose of study treatment will 
not be replaced. 
8. STUDY ASSESSMENTS AN D PROC EDURES  
Study procedures and their timing are summarized in the Schedule of Activities (Section 1.2). Adherence to the study design requirements, including those specified in the Schedule of Activities, is essential and required for study conduct. Protocol waivers or exemptions are not

the study.
All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that potential subjects 
meet all eligibility criteria. The investigator will main tain a screening log to record details of all 
subjects screened and to confirm eligibility or record reasons for screen failure, as applicable.
Passive External Rotation at 0°, 45°, and 90° of Abduction
Passive external rotation at 0°, 45°, and 90° of abduction will be measured in both shoulders 
using a goniometer at screening in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547]. In the event that 45° and 90° cannot be 
achieved due to pain or restriction in the affected shoulder, the amount of external rotation 
available at maximum attainable abduction ROM is permissible as the second and third measurements.
Hand Dominance
The subject’s self-reported hand dominance will be recorded at screening.
Supervised In-office Physical Therapy
All subjects will undergo a standard supervised in-office PT regimen. The PT regimen will 
consist of [ADDRESS_528807] with a set of instructions and any necessary equipment (ie, pulleys) to 
complete the home exercises. These home exercises should be performed by [CONTACT_419359] [ADDRESS_528808] on the use of the diary and will  review the diary at vi sits specified in the 
Schedule of Activities to ensure compliance.

must be completed prior to any other assessments.
8.1.1. Adapted American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Standardized Shoulder Form
The adapted ASES is a questionnaire to assess AC patient rated shoulder pain and function that 
has been modified from the ASES Standardized Shoulder Form ( McClure and Michener, 2003 ; 
Michener, 2002). The adapted ASES is a self-administered PRO measure, divided into 2 sections: a pain subscale and a function subscale. The pain subscale is a single item, numeric rating scale about pain in the affected shoulder on the day of assessment. The 11-point numeric 
rating scale ranges from 0 (No pain at all) to 10 (Pain as bad as it can be). The function subscale 
consists of [ADDRESS_528809] is asked to indicate on a 4 point ordinal 
scale their ability to do the activity with the affected arm (Evidera, 2016 ).
All subjects will complete the adapted ASES at times outlined in the Schedule of Activities. These data will be entered by [CONTACT_419360] (eCOA) instrument while the subject is alone with no study site personnel in the 
room. On treatment days (Day s 1, 22 and 43), the adapted ASES must be completed prior to 
study treatment in jection. 
8.1.2. Range of Motion
PROM (for forward flexion, internal rotation, external rotation, abduction, and shoulder 
extension) and AROM (for forward flexion, inte rnal rotation, external rotation, abduction, and 
shoulder extension) will be measured using a goniometer, and a spi[INVESTIGATOR_139730] (for internal rotation) at times specified in the Schedule of Activities for the affected and contralateral shoulder. These measurements will be completed with the subject in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547].
8.1.3. Pain Upon Movement
The PUM Scale is a single item 11-point numerical rating scale of pain that asks subjects to rate 
the pain in their affected shoulder after AROM forward flexion, internal rotation, external 
rotation, abduction, and shoulder extension on a scale from 0 (No pain at all) to 10 (Pain as bad 
as it can be).
All subjects will complete the PUM at times outlined in the Schedule of Activities. The PUM 
data will be entered by [CONTACT_419361].
8.1.4. Patient-reported Global Severity of Adhesive Capsulitis
The Patient-reported Global Severity of Adhesive Capsulitis is a single item 11-point numerical 
rating scale that asks subjects to rate the overall severity of their AC symptoms on a scale from 
0 (No symptoms) to 10 (Symptoms as bad as they can be).
All subjects will complete the Patient-reported Global Severity of Adhesive Capsulitis scale at 
times outlined in the Schedule of Activities. The Patient-reported Global Severity of Adhesive 
Capsulitis data will be entered by [CONTACT_419362].

Subjects will rate their satisfaction with  treatment on a 5-point Likert scale from Very 
Dissatisfied to Very Satisfied at times specified in the Schedule of Activities. The response will 
be entered directly into an eC OA instrument and co mpleted wh ile the sub ject is alone with no 
study site personnel in the room. The subject will be  instructed to refrain from discussing their 
rating with the investigator and any other site personnel.
8.1.6. Investigator Assessment of Improvement with Treatment
Investigators will provide their assessment of improvement with treatment for each subject using 
a 7-point Likert scale from Very Much Worse to  Very Much Improved at times specified in the 
Schedule of Activities. The response will be entered directly into an eCOA instrument. The 
investigator will refrain from discussing their rating with the subject.
8.1.7. Magnetic Resonance Imaging and X-rays
MRIs of the affected and contralateral shoulder will be performed for all subjects at times 
specified in the Schedule of Activities. Subj ects should complete all other screening activities, 
including an X-ray of the affected shoulder, prior to the MRIs required at screening, and must 
meet the entry criteria of passive external rotation assessment at 0°, 45°, and 90° abduction and 
have an adapted ASES function subscale score (< 35) in the affected shoulder prior to the conduct of the screening MRIs. Previous X-rays of the affected shoulder may be used if they 
were taken within [ADDRESS_528810] be able (in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_84740]) to have the affected arm passively

laboratory abnormality . New clinically significant labor atory abnormaliti es or clinically 
significant changes in laboratory values will be reported as AEs (or SAEs, ifappropriate).
Clinical laboratory test data will be reviewed by [CONTACT_093], or designee, and additional 
clinical laboratory tests may be ordered at his/ her discretion. Any additional testing will be 
performed by [CONTACT_119094]. 
8.2.9. Pregnancy Testing
All female subjects of childbearing potential will have serum and/or urine pregnancy tests 
performed at the time points outlined in the Schedule of Activities. Results must be available 
prior to protocol mandated study treatment administrati on. Subjects with positive results at the 
Screening Visit or the Day1 Visit will be ineligible for study entry. Any female subject that 
becomes pregnant during the study will be immediately discontinued from study treatment, but 
may continue in the study (see Section 7.1). All pregnancies will be reported as per 
Section8.3.5. 
If applicable, the subject’s agreement to use contraception throughout their study participation (from Screening to the Day 95 Visit), or for [ADDRESS_528815] be recorded, regardless of whether associated with the use of study treatment. 
This would include AEs resulting from concurrent illness, reactions to concurrent medication 
use, or progression of disease states (excluding the disease under study). A condition present at baseline that worsens after initiation of study treatment will be captured as an AE; the onset date 
will be the date the event worsened. The AE should be recorded in standard medical terminology 
when possible.
8.3.1. Time Period and Frequency for Collecting AE and SAE Information 
All AEs and SAEs will be collected by [CONTACT_941] i nvestigator from the time of signing the informed 
consent form (ICF) through the Day [ADDRESS_528816] visit. 
Subjects will be asked to volunteer information concerning AEs with a nonleading question such 
as, “How do you feel?” Study site personnel will then record all pertinent information. The study 
treatment compliance record should also be reviewed to detect poten tial intentional or 
unintentional overdoses.
Any AEs identified in the subject diaries will be reported in the appropriate electronic case report 
form (eCRF) module, and if SAEs, as described in S ection10.3.
8.3.3. Follow-up of AEs and SAEs
After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactively follow each subject at 
subsequent visits/contacts. All nonserious AEs must be followed until resolution or until the last 
study visit whichever comes first; except for s ubjects who withdraw early from the study for 
whom nonserious AEs will be followed until resolution or for [ADDRESS_528817]. 
All SAEs and nonserious AESIs will be followe d to resolution, stabilization, the event is 
otherwise explained, or until follow-up is no l onger possible. Further information on follow-up 
procedures is provided in Section 10.3.
8.3.4. Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SAEs
Prompt notification by [CONTACT_419370].
The sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and other 
regulatory agencies about the safety of the study treatment under clinical investigation. The 
sponsor will comply with country-specific regulatory  requirements regarding safety reporting to 
regulatory authorities, IRBs/I ECs, and investigators.
Investigator safety reports must be prepared for suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) according to local regulatory requirements and sponsor policy, and forwarded to 
investigators as necessary. 
An investigator who receives a S[LOCATION_003]R (IND Safety Report) describing an SAE or other specific 
safety information (ie, summary or listing of SAEs) from the sponsor will review and then file it 

EN3835-210 Protocol Amendment 4
22 October 2021 Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 46with the Investigator’s Brochure, and will notify the IRB/IEC, if appropriate according to local 
requirements.
8.3.5. Pregnancy
All subject pregnancies that are identified during or after this study, where the estimated date of 
conception is determined to have occurred at any time during the study or (within [ADDRESS_528818] study treatment for those who terminate early) must be reported, followed to conclusion, and 
the outcome reported, even if the subject is withdr awn from the study. Pregnancies that occur in 
the partner of a treated subject (ie, female partner of male subject) also must be reported. The investigator must report (as outlined above) all pregnancies within [ADDRESS_528819] interfered with the effectiveness of a contraceptive medication. 
Likewise, elective abortions without complicatio ns are not considered AEs. Any SAEs 
associated with pregnancy (eg, congenital abnormalities/birth defects, or any other serious 
events) must additionally be reported as such using the Serious Adverse Event (SAE)/Reportable Event Form (see Section 10.3). Spontaneous miscarriages should also be reported and handled as 
SAEs. 
Subjects will be instructed to immediately notify the investigator of any pregnancies. 
A subject who becomes pregnant must be immediately discontinued from study tr eatment but 
may remain in the study (see Section 7.1). Should a subject discontinue study treatment due to 
pregnancy, alternative treatment (if available) should be arranged according to standard of care, 
as determined by [CONTACT_093]. Attempts to obtain the pregnancy follow-up and pregnancy outcome information detailed above are necessary even if a subject withdraws from the study 
because of pregnancy.
8.3.6. AEs/SAEs Experienced by [CONTACT_419371], including instances of diversion of study treatment. Any AEs/SAEs occurring in nonsubjects from such exposure will be reported to the Endo PVRM Department (when the 
nonsubject agrees) on the Serious Adverse Event (SAE)/Reportable Event Form regardless of 
whether the event is serious or not. Instructions for completing the form for events experienced by [CONTACT_419372]. SAEs occurring in nonsubjects exposed to study treatment will 
be processed within the same SAE reporting timelines as described in Sect ion10.3. Additionally, 
the treatment accountability source documentation at the site should reflect this occurrence.
8.3.7. Adverse Events of Special Interest 
AESIs for this study include:
!Bruising, ecchym osis, hematomas, and contusions that occur remote to the site of
treatment administration.

EN3835-210 Protocol Amendment 4
22 October 2021 Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 47!Any hypersensiti vity reactions.
These events will be reported as AEs inthe eCRF. All AESIs will be evaluated for seriousness 
and severity. If any of these events meet the cr iteria for an SAE, they will also be reported as 
such using the procedure outlined in Section 10.3.
8.4. Overdose
Study treatment overdose is any accidental or intentional use of treatment in an amount higher than the dose indicated by [CONTACT_12546]. Study treatment compliance should be 
reviewed to detect potential instances of overdose (intentional or accidental).
Any treatment overdose during the study should be noted on the study  treatmen t eCRF. 
An overdose is not an AE per se, however all AEs associated with an overdose should both be 
entered on the AE eCRF and reported using the procedures detailed in Section 10.3, even if the 
events do not meet seriousness criteria. If the AE associated with an overdose does not meet 
seriousness criteria, it must still be repor ted using the Endo Serious Adverse Event 
(SAE)/Reportable Event Form and in an expedited manner, but should be noted as nonserious on 
the form and the AE eCRF. 
8.4.1. Study Treatment Abuse/Misuse

9. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS AND METHODS
9.1. Sample Size Determination
A post hoc analysis was conducted using a subgroup of AUX-CC-871 subjects who were rated 
with moderate/severe AC based on baseline MRI images. This subgroup displayed a notable treatment effect (EN3835 vsplacebo) on the pain and composite components of the adapted 
ASES questionnaire. This subgroup also displayed a treatment effect trend for the functional 
component of the adapted ASES. Given this result, the sample size calculation is based on the mean and SD found in this subgroup for the adapted ASES composite score on Day 95. Given a 
mean change from baseline value of 38.6 for the EN3835 group and 27.6 for the placebo group 
with an SD of 21.6, a sample size of approximately 142 subjects would be required given a 1:1 randomization and a type I e rror of 0.05 with a power of 85%. With an expected drop-out rate of 
approximately 20%, 180 subjects (90 EN3835 and 90 placebo) should be dosed to ensure 142 subjects complete the study.
9.2. Populations for Analysis
Forthe purposes of analysis, the following populations are defined:
!The Safety Populatio n is defined as all randomized subjects who received at least 1
injection of study treatment (EN3835 or placebo). All safety analyses will be based
on this population.
!The Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Population is defined as all randomized subjects whoreceived at least 1 injection of study treatment (EN3835 or placebo).
!The Modified Intent-to-Treat (mITT) Population is defined as all ITT subjects whohave a valid baseline adapted ASES composite score in the affected shoulder and atleast 1 valid adapted ASES composite score after the injection of the study treatment.
All efficacy analyses will be based on this population.
!The Per-Protocol (PP) Population is defined as those subjects in the mITT Population
who do not have any major protocol deviations. Determination of PP subjects will becompleted before the study database is closed and locked. If more than 10% of the
mITT Population is excluded from the PP Population, then all efficacy summaries
will be repeated using the PP Population for the sensitivity analysis.

EN3835-210 Protocol Amendment 4
22 October 2021 Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 5610.3. Appendix 3: Adverse Events: Definitions and Procedures for 
Recording, Evaluating, Follow-up, and Reporting
10.3.1. Definitions
An AE is any unfavorable or unintended change  in body structure (signs), body function 
(symptoms), laboratory result (eg, chemistry, EC G, X-ray, etc), or worsening of a preexisting 
condition associated temporally with the use of the study treatment whether or not considered 
related to the study treatment. AEs will be captured once a subject has signed the informed 
consent. AEs include:
!Changes in the general condition of the subject.
!Participative symptoms offered by [CONTACT_303406].
!Objective signs observed by [CONTACT_419379].
!All concurrent diseases that occur after the start of the study, including any change in
severity or frequency of preexisting disease.
!All clinically relevant laboratory abnormali ties or physical findings that occur during
the study.
A TEAE is any condition that was not present prior to tr eatment with study treatment but 
appeared following treatment, was present at tr eatment initiation but worsened during treatment, 
or was present at treatment initiation but resolved and then reappeared while the individual was on treatment (regardless of the intensity of the AE when the treatment was initiated).
An SAE is defined as an AE that:
!Results in death
!Is immediately life-threatening (there is an immediate risk of death from the AE as it
occurred; this does not include an AE that had it occurred in a more serious form may
have caused death)
!Results in or prolongs an inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (Note: a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_419339], procedure, or treatment therapy does not constitute an SAE)
!Results in permanent or substantial disability (permanent or substantial disruption ofone’s ability to conduct normal life functions)
!Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect (in offspring of a subject using the studytreatment regardless of time to diagnosis)
!Is considered an important medical event
Important medical events are defined as events that, based upon appropriate medical judgment, 
may jeopardize the subject and may require medi cal or surgical treatment to prevent 1 of the 
other serious outcomes. Examples of important medical events include allergic bronchospasm 
requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions 
that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of treatment dependency or 
treatment abuse. 

EN3835-210 Protocol Amendment 4
22 October 2021 Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 5710.3.2. Relationship to Study Treatment
The degree of “relatedness” of the AE to the st udy treatment must be described using the 
following scale: 
!Not related indicates that the AE is definitely not related to the study treatment.
!Unlikely related indicates that there are other, more likely causes and study
treatment is not suspected as a cause.
!Possibly related indicates that a direct cause and effect relationship between study
treatment and the AE has not been demonstrated, but there is evidence to suggest
there is a reasonable possibility that the event was caused by [CONTACT_104841].
!Probably related indicates that there is evidence suggesting a direct cause and effect
relationship between the AE and the study treatment.
It is the sponsor’s policy to consider “Probably related” and “Possibly related” causality 
assessments as positive causality. “Not related” and “Unlikely related” causality assessments are 
considered as negative causality.
Causality assessments will be recorded on the eCRF and must indicate clearly the relationship 
being assessed. For example, an AE that a ppears during a placebo run-in phase would be 
assessed with respect to the placebo treatment received and/or study procedures conducted 
during this phase. If the AE continued into an active treatment phase, the relationship would be 
assessed for the active treatment phase only if the AE worsened.
10.3.3. Intensity Assessment
The intensity (or severity) of AEs is characterized as mild, moderate, or severe:
!MildAEs are usually transient, requiring no special treatment, and do not inte rfere
with the subject’s daily activities.
!Moderate AEs introduce a low level of inconvenience or concern to the subject and
may interfere with daily activities, but ar e usually ameliorated by [CONTACT_246625].
!SevereAEs interrupt a subject’s usual daily activity and typi[INVESTIGATOR_419340].
10.3.4. Reporting Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events
[IP_ADDRESS]. Reporting Adverse Events
Throughout the study, AEs will be documented on the source document and on the appropriate
page of the eCRF whether or not considered treatment related.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Reporting Serious Adverse Events
Any SAE, including death resulting from any cause, which occurs to any subject in this study, 
must be reported via email or fax by [CONTACT_76622] E ndo Serious Adverse Event 
(SAE)/Reportable Event Form within [ADDRESS_528828] be reported within 7 or 15 day s to regulatory 
authorities in compliance with local and re gional law. If so, the sponsor (or the sponsor’s 
representative) will report the event to the appropriate regulatory authorities. The investigator 
will report SAEs to the IRB/IEC per their IRB/IEC policy.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Follow-up Procedures for Serious Adverse Events
To fully understand the nature of any SAE, obtaining follow-up information is important. 
Whenever possible, relevant medical records such as discharge summaries, medical consultations, and the like should be obtained. In the event of death, regardless of cause, all 
attempts should be made to obtain the death certificate and any autopsy report. These records 
should be reviewed in detail, and the investigator should comment on any event, lab abnormality, 
or any other finding, noting whether it should be considered a serious or nonserious AE, or 
whether it should be considered as part of the subject’s history. In addition, all events or other 
findings determined to be SAEs should be identified on the Serious Adverse Event (SAE)/ 
Reportable Event Form and the in vestigator should consider whether the event is related or not 
related to study treatmen t. All events determined to be nonserious should be reported on the 
eCRF.

bilirubin ∀2 × ULN (> 35% direct bilirubin) or ALT ∀3 × ULN and international normalized 
ratio (INR) > 1.5 (if INR measured) which may indicate severe liver injury (possible Hy’s Law cases) must be reported as an SAE as outlined in Section 10.3.4(excluding studies of hepatic 
impairment or cirrhosis).
Subjects with confirmed Hy’s Law liver injury will be immediately withdrawn from study 
treatment and no rechallenge will be allowed.

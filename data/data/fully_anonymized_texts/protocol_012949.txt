Preliminary Notes:  
When completing various forms for this clinical trial, u se black ink only. If a mistake is
made, cross it out and initial.
Review every fo rm for completion. Identify missing items with participant and if  the
participant does not wish to complete for any reason note “did not complete” in the space
provided. Do not leave any section blank.
In the event of an adverse event, the Medical Officer i s to be contact[CONTACT_21116] a current
Prompt Reporting Form will need to be downloaded from the Office of ResearchAdministration website and submitted within 24 hours of the event.

b.Reinstruct participant  prior to testing:
(1) “The purpose of this test is to find your judgments of the loudness of different 
sounds. You will hear sounds that increase and decrease in volume. You must 
make a judgment about how loud the sounds are. Pretend you are listening to the radio at that volume. How loud would it be? After each sound, tell me which of these categories best describes the loudness. Keep in mind that an uncomfortably loud sound is louder than you would ever choose on your radio no matter what mood you are in.”

d.Participant  will respond to varied presentation levels on seven-point scale of
loudness using the Categories of Loudness (1- 8) as a reference.

M. SESSION [ADDRESS_403822] (1 -14) 
1. Ensure all portions of the checklist are completed.
N. S TUDY CONSENT FORM #2 (1 -15A FOR TYPI[INVESTIGATOR_327351] 1 -15B FOR REDUCED PURCHASE PRICE GROUP), MEDICAL WAIVER (1 -
16) AND ELIGIBILITY PART 2 (1 -17)
1.CTC  review s the general nature of the study including approximate number of sessions
and the requirement to purchase hearing aids.
2.CTC  informs participant  of the FDA requirement for medical clearance. If participant
elects to waive the right to medical evaluation /clearance and is interested in
participating in the  clinical trial, he or she will sign  the Study Consent Form #2 (1 -15a
or 1-15b) and the Medical Waiver  (1-16).
a.If participant  does not waive the medical evaluation and clearance, the participant is
not eligible for the study. Only  participants who choose to waive medical clearance
prior to hearing aid purchase are accepted to the study . If participant does not wish
to waive medical evaluation and clearance, participant should be referred to the IU
Hearing  Clinic.
3.CTC  will complete  Eligibility Part 2  (1-17). If the answer to any of the exclusion
criteria questions is “yes” , the participant  is not eligible.
4.If participant  is not eligible , or is eligible but does not want to participate in study, CTC
will cancel the Session 2 appointment and escort participant  out of building.
5.If participant  agrees to participate , signs Study Consent Form #2 (1 -15a or 1 -15b),
completes the Medical Waiver  (1-16), and does not answer “ yes” to any of the
exclusion criteria, CTC  will assign  participant  to one of [ADDRESS_403823] participant  in a low (≤  40% correct),
medium (40% < score < 68%), or high (≥  68% correct)  performance group , and use
this information for randomizing the participant  into a treatment group .
b. Participant groups are stratified by [CONTACT_327366]. For the initial half of the study,
participants are randomized into treatment groups (AB, CD, P)  using the typi[INVESTIGATOR_327352] (TPP) . Then, for roughly the second h alf of the study, participants
are randomized  into treatment groups using the reduced purchase price (RPP).
Within each purchase price group, subjects are randomized to one of three treatment
groups: audiology- based ( AB), placebo  (P-AB), or consumer- decides ( CD) using
pre-generated random orders yielding roughly equal proportions of AB, CD and P
group assignments . The possible treatment groups include: P- AB/TPP, P- AB/RPP,
AB/TPP, AB/RPP, CD /RPP, and CD /TPP.   (NOTE: Sect 5.b, was edited AFTER
STUDY COMPLETI ON to reflect what actually took place.  The shared protocol
manual used by [CONTACT_327367].  Audiologists A1, A2,A3 and A4 were unaware of this deception re: the ordering of purchase priceassignment as was confirmed in individual interviews with the audiologists by [CONTACT_32709] [INVESTIGATOR_327353].)
c.Depending on the purchase price being used , CTC  discusses the purchase price with
the participant , which is  due, in full, at the time of Session 2.
d.CTC  informs  the participant  that a 16.7% discount on purchase price will be
provided by [CONTACT_319300] 3 sessions.
6.CTC  tells participant : “The audiologists are involved in only the research portion of this
[ADDRESS_403824]; therefore, they will not know information about purchase price. I am the 
business contact, so if you have questions please c ontact  me.” CTC  gives participant  a 
business card. 
7.At this time, CTC  verifies  the appointment to come in the next day for Session 2.
8. A copy of the participant’s completed A udiogram (1-6), RECD measurements , and an
envelope containing the probe tubes used during RECD should be placed in Session 2folder for hearing aid programming.

e. Real -ear measurement on V erifit
(1) Use Verifit to obtain real -ear measurements to verify hearing aids meet NAL -
NL2 target output for speechmap . 
(2) “Tests”  “On-ear measures”  “Speechmap ” 
(3) Enter  participant ’s RECD measurements along with pure- tone air -conduction 
22 thresholds. 
(4) Insert one probe tube i n each ear . 
(a) Check  that the probe tube is connected to the appropriate R/L cord.

un-mute hearing aids.  
(5) Run speechmap with  “carrot passage” speech stimulus at [ADDRESS_403830] and then 
fine-tune gain until it matches targets  appropriately. 
(a) Target -matching rule: for 250 through 4000 Hz, all measured values  within 
4 dB of target at all frequencies in this range is the goal , but will accept fit 
after initial fine -tuning attempts if within 7 dB of target at all frequencies in 
this range.  
(b) If unable to meet + or – [ADDRESS_403831] that participant  in the stu dy. If 
this happens, “ flag” the file and let PI  [INVESTIGATOR_327356].

(a) “You will hear several loud beeps that get higher in pi[INVESTIGATOR_23025]. The beeps will be 
loud, but if they get “uncomfortably loud” (refer to Categori es of Loudness ), 
raise your hand. The beeps are very quick, so try to raise your hand as quickly as possible. We can repeat if necessary.”  
(3) Run the [ADDRESS_403834] MPO stimulus with the hearing aid on in right ear only. Left hearing aid should be muted.  
(4) If partic ipant indicates a tone is “uncomfortably loud”, decrease maximum 
output at corresponding frequency respectively by [ADDRESS_403835] (2 -1), and re- initiate [ADDRESS_403836] stimuli.  
(5) Continue until “uncomfortably loud” responses are no longer obtained. 
(6) Repeat with left hearing aid  on and right hearing aid muted. 
(7) Finally, turn both hearing aids on and run the MPO stimulus. If participant reports none of the sounds are “uncomfortably loud” move on to programming VC (g). If participant  reports one of the sounds uncomfortably loud, determine 
which frequency to lower by 2 dB in both hearing aids until “uncomfortably loud” response is no longer obtained. Record any adjustments on Session [ADDRESS_403837] (2 -1). 
(8) Before removing hearing aids , review “beeps ” with participant  by [CONTACT_116828] 
“Beeps and  Volume Control” in Aventa software and presenting each beep 
24 sample (delayed start , low battery, and program  change), verify ing that beeps 
are loud enough.

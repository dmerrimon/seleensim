(Pragmatic Airway Resuscitation Trial) 
Aim:  The objective of this pragmatic trial is to compare the effectiveness of primary (initial) 
endotracheal intubation (ETI) versus primary (initial) laryngeal tube (LT) airway management 
strategies upon 72-hour survival after out- of-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_164132] (OHCA) .  
Rationale:  Cardiopulmonary arrest is the sudden cessation of heart function and circulatory blood 
flow resulting in whole-body ischemia. Sudden out- of-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_425911] (OHCA) is a 
major public health problem affecting over 300,[ADDRESS_1215204] management is the process of 
opening the mouth and throat to deliver oxygen to the lungs for circulation to the vital organs.  
Endotracheal intubation (ETI),  the insertion of a plastic breathing tube through the mouth and into 
the trachea, is the most common advanced airway management technique in OHCA resuscitation 
in North America. As the first to provide critical care in the out- of-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6885], paramedics in 
North America have performed ETI on OHCA victims for over 30 years. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_870310], 
ETI involves many pi[INVESTIGATOR_30207]. Adverse events associated with ETI include unrecognized tube 
misplacement or dislodgement, repeated intubation attempts, iatrogenic hyperventilation, hypoxia 
and bradycardia, and unintended interruptions in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) chest 
compression continuity.2-7 In the US, resources for paramedic ETI training are often inadequate.8 
Individual clinical experience is also sparse; in Pennsylvania, paramedics perform a median of 
one (1) ETI annually.9  
Supraglottic airways (SGA) such as the Laryngeal Tube (King Systems, Noblesville, IN) , 
Combitube (Covidien, Ltd, Mansfield, MA), Laryngeal Mask Airway (LMA North American, San 
Diego, CA) and i-Gel (Intersurgical, Inc., Liverpool, NY) are simpler than ETI yet ventilate as well. 
Because of the fewer pi[INVESTIGATOR_870311], many paramedics favor primary SGA over 
ETI. However, it is unclear if outcomes are improved with primary SGA- versus ETI-based airway 
management strategies. The LT is the most common SGA used by [CONTACT_870403].10  
Hypotheses:  The primary null hypothesis is that 72-hour survival is similar between primary 
Laryngeal Tube (LT) SGA and primary ETI airway management strategies. Evaluated secondary 
outcomes will include return of spontaneous circulation, survival to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345], 
neurologically intact survival at hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345], airway management performance, and clinical 
adverse events.  
Study Design:  This trial will use a cluster randomized design with period ic crossover. 
Responding EMS personnel will perform airway management using either a strategy of primary 
ETI (control) or primary LT insertion (intervention). The trial will be designed to detect the 
superiority of either primary ETI or primary LT airway management over the other intervention 
arm. 
Study Population:  
- Inclusion Criteria:  Adult (age ≥18 years or per local interpretation), non-traumatic OHCA with 
EMS personnel on scene and requiring advanced airway insertion (ETI, LT) or ventilatory 
support such as by [CONTACT_870404]-valve-mask device or non-rebreather mask .

Clinical Trial Protocol   
 
 
  - Exclusion Criteria:  Known pregnant women, known prisoners, patients with major facial 
trauma, major bleeding or exsanguination, patients receiving initial care by [CONTACT_105]-PART 
participating EMS agency capable of performing ETI, LT or other advanced airway insertion, 
patients with ET tube, LT or other advanced airway insertion prior to ROC EMS arrival, 
patients with a pre-existing tracheostomy, obvious asphyxial cardiac arrest (choking or 
hanging) , patients with a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) or total artificial heart (TAH), 
patients with pre-existing “do- not-attempt-resuscitation” (DNAR) orders, inter-facility 
transports, and patients with a “do not enroll” bracelet.  
Study Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]:  
- 1) Primary Endotracheal Intubation  (Control): Advanced-level EMS personnel will use ETI 
as the primary (initial) advanced airway management intervention. Basic-level EMS 
personnel will use bag-valve-mask (BVM) ventilation only.  
- 2) Primary Laryngeal Tube Supraglottic Airway Insertion  (Intervention): Advanced-level 
EMS personnel will use the Laryngeal Tube (LT) as the primary (initial) advanced airway 
management intervention, and basic-level EMS personnel will use bag-valve-mask 
ventilation. If trained to use LT, basic-level EMS personnel may perform LT insertion as the 
primary (initial) airway intervention .  
EMS agencies that do not utilize LT will be excluded from the trial. All other aspects of 
resuscitation will follow local EMS protocols, including chest compression methods, timing of 
rhythm analysis, and insertion of intravenous lines and administration of medications. If allowed 
by [CONTACT_870405], advanced and basic-level EMS personnel may use a non-rebreather (NRB) 
mask instead of BVM ventilation. 
Outcomes:  
The primary outcome will be:  
1) 72-hour hospi[INVESTIGATOR_125739] , defined as patient status (alive/dead) at [ADDRESS_1215206]. 
Secondary outcomes will include:  
1) Return of Spontaneous Circulation (ROSC) , defined as the presence of palpable pulses  
upon ED arrival.  
2) Airway Management Clinical Course , including sequence of ETI/ LT insertion, ETI/ LT 
insertion success and time, number of ETI/ LT insertion attempts, and airway conversion 
(change of LT-to-ETI, or ETI- to-LT) in the receiving Emergency Department. 
3) Adverse Events, including  initially  unrecognized airway misplacement (including 
endotracheal tube misplacement), inadequate ventilation requiring airway exchange , 
vomiting, oropharyngeal, hypopharyngeal or gastrointestinal trauma, and pneumothorax.4,11  
4) Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_182787],  defined as patient status (alive/dead) at hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345].

  5) Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_870312],  defined as Modified Rankin Score ≤3 
upon hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345].  
Analysis: We will calculate the difference in outcomes divided by [CONTACT_639402] “robust” standard 
error based on the Huber-White sandwich estimator in order to account for within cluster 
correlation and variability, which might depart from the classical assumptions.[ADDRESS_1215208], we will calculate the 95% CI for the difference in event rates. We will perform the 
analysis on an intention- to-treat (primary analysis) as well as treatment-received bases 
(secondary analysis). 
Sample Size: The trial will require 2,612 subjects (1,306 per group) to have 85% power to detect 
a 4.5% absolute difference in 72-hour survival, given baseline survival of 13.7% and an overall 
two-sided alpha of 0.05. To allow for subject withdrawal and lost- to-follow- up, the trial will enroll 
up to 3,000 subjects. 
Regulatory and Ethical Considerations:  The trial will be carried out under federal rules for 
Exception from Informed Consent (EFIC) outlined by [CONTACT_43970] “Waiver of Informed 
Consent Requirements in Certain Emergency Research” (Federal Register, Vol. 61, pp. [ZIP_CODE]-

http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/humansubjects/guidance/45cfr46.html#46.101 ), and FDA regulation s [ADDRESS_1215209] Resuscitation Trial  Version 7.0 – November 29, [ADDRESS_1215210] (OHCA) is a major public 
health problem affecting over 300,[ADDRESS_1215211] victim, the oxygen delivered to the lungs is subsequently circulated to 
the vital organs through cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) chest compressions.  
Endotracheal Intubation is the Most Common Airway 
Management Technique.  Basic techniques for airway 
management include “head-tilt/chin lift” and the jaw 
thrust. However, to optimize airway patency, rescuers 
usually opt for more advanced airway management 
techniques. In North America, endotracheal intubation 
(ETI) is the most common advanced airway 
management technique in both in-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_549641]- of-
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_69225]. (Figure 1) ETI (or “intubation”) involves 
exposure of the vocal cords using a large lighted metal 
laryngoscope blade inserted in the mouth and insertion 
of a plastic breathing tube through the throat, between 
the vocal cords and into the trachea. ETI is the preferred 
method for airway management because it provides a 
direct conduit to the lungs, facilitates easier and more 
controlled delivery of oxygen, and protects the lungs 
from aspi[INVESTIGATOR_870313]. ETI is a complex technique 
involving over [ADDRESS_1215212] performed ETI on OHCA victims for over 
30 years.14-17 However, numerous studies highlight the pi[INVESTIGATOR_870314]. For 
example, unrecognized misplacement of the endotracheal tube (in the esophagus rather than the 
trachea) has been reported in up to one-fourth of paramedic ETI.[ADDRESS_1215213] Resuscitation Trial  Version 7.0 – November 29, 2016 
Clinical Trial Protocol   
 
 
  success rates >90%, using US national data we observed ETI success rates of only 70%.[ADDRESS_1215214] compressions – 
including even brief 20-second interruptions – 
may disrupt coronary blood flow, impairing 
OHCA survival.23,[ADDRESS_1215215] compression interruptions 
associated with intubation efforts by [CONTACT_870406][INVESTIGATOR_870315].7 In this series of 100 
OHCA, ETI efforts resulted in a median of two 
(2) CPR interruptions (IQR 1-3; range 1- 6), 
totaling a median of 109.5 seconds (IQR: 54-
198; range 13-446). One-fourth of the CPR 
interruptions exceeded three (3) minutes. 
(Figure 2) 
Paramedic Intubation Training and Experience are Inadequate.  While ETI is complex, 
opportunities for baseline training and continuing experience are inadequate.9,[ADDRESS_1215216] perform only five (5) ETI prior to graduation.26-
[ADDRESS_1215217] nationally 
accredited paramedic training programs receive only 
2-4 days of this training experience.8 Some training 
programs are not able to provide any operating room 
training. Mannequins do not adequately recreate the 
“feel” of live human airways. 
Regular clinical experience is important for 
maintaining ETI skill. Throughout Pennsylvania in 
2003, practicing paramedics performed a median of 
one (1) ETI (interquartile range 0-3) annually; 39% 
performed no ETI, and 67% performed fewer than 
two (2) ETI.33 In Maine, Burton, et al. found that only 
40% of paramedics attempted ETI annually, and only 
1-2% of all paramedics performed five (5) or more 
ETI annually.34  
 
Supraglottic Airways (SGA) - Simpler 
Alternatives to Intubation.  Supraglottic airways 
(SGA) offer simpler alternatives to ETI. SGA in 
current North American EMS use include the 
Laryngeal Mask Airway (LMA) , Combitube and King 
Laryngeal Tube.35,36 SGA are inserted “blindly”

  through the mouth and sit outside of the vocal cords.37 (Figure 3) Compared with ETI, SGAs offer 
simple and expeditious operation, lower skill acquisition and maintenance thresholds, and similar 
ventilatory characteristics. While previously reserved for contingency use in the event of 
unsuccessful ETI efforts, many EMS agencies now perform advanced airway management using 
a strategy of primary SGA insertion.[ADDRESS_1215219] communities, including Kalamazoo, Michigan; Chesterfield County, 
Virginia; Collier County, [LOCATION_012]; and Dallas, [LOCATION_007]. 
Observational Data Offer Unclear 
Guidance.  SGA are more pragmatic 
than ETI and would be expected to 
result in similar or better outcomes 
after OHCA However, OHCA 
outcomes after SGA insertion are 
unclear. In a secondary analysis of 
data from the Resuscitation Outcomes 
Consortium PRIMED study, we 
studied 10,4 55 adult OHCA, including 
8,487 (81.2%) who received ETI and 
1,968 (18.8%) who received SGA.10 
Compared with SGA, ETI was 
independently associated with higher 
adjusted odds of return of 
spontaneous circulation, survival to 
discharge, and survival to discharge 
with good neurologic function, even 
after multivariable adjustment for 
confounders. (Figure 4) 
We performed a similar analysis using 
8,[ADDRESS_1215220] Registry to Enhance Survival (CARES), 
including 5,591 (64.3%) ETI and 3,110 (35.7%) SGA.[ADDRESS_1215221] studies

Frascone, et al. compared ETI and LT performance in a randomized series of [ADDRESS_1215231] 
management pouches. The overall placement success rate was virtually equal across the two 
groups (ETI=80.2%, King LT=80.5%; p=0.97). The median time to placement between ETI and 
the King LT was also not significantly different (ETI=19.5 seconds vs. King LTS-D=20.0 seconds ; 
p=0.80). The study was strictly focused on airway insertion performance and did not evaluate 
patient outcomes.  
Benger, et al. have completed the pi[INVESTIGATOR_133747] a trial in the [LOCATION_008] comparing ETI 
versus i-Gel and LMA insertion in adult OHCA.48 Randomization occurred by [CONTACT_870412]. From a total of 1,375 OHCA undergoing active resuscitation, 615 patients were 
enrolled (232 i-Gel, 174 LMA, 209 usual practice [ETI]). The LMA arm was suspended after 10 
months due to staff safety concerns (forceful expulsion of blood and/or stomach contents from the 
gastric port of the LMA).56 The rates of transport to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], return of spontaneous circulation and

not significantly different. The study group will soon start a larger scale trial of n=9,[ADDRESS_1215232] management of adult OHCA. 
However, a shift in practice occurred in the US 
approximately 5 years ago, with multiple US EMS 
agencies switching to SGA as the primary device in 
OHCA resuscitation. Several ROC EMS agencies 
(including those affiliated with the Dallas, Pi[INVESTIGATOR_9109], 
and Portland centers) currently utilize SGA as the 
primary airway management device in patients with 
OHCA. (Table 2 )  
We have verified in extensive discussions with the 
ROC EMS Operations committee that paramedics are 
willing to randomize OHCA patients to ETI or LT.

 Interventions 12.
 EMS Personnel Training Levels 12.1
The interventions in this trial may involve coordination between advanced- and basic-level EMS 
personnel.57 
- Advanced-level EMS personnel (Advanced Life Support, ALS, paramedic, advanced care 
paramedic) perform advanced-level interventions, including intravenous drug administration, 
manual defibrillation, and advanced airway management interventions (ETI and SGA).  
- Basic-level EMS personnel (Basic Life Support, BLS, Emergency Medical Technician, EMT) 
perform basic measures such as CPR and automated defibrillation. Bag-valve-mask 
ventilation is their primary airway management intervention, although select EMS agencies 
may perform SGA (LT) insertion.58,[ADDRESS_1215240] BLS EMS personnel among ROC 
EMS agencies perform SGA insertion 
(Table 2). The trial design will try to 
accommodate all configurations of EMS 
response. 
 Primary Endotracheal Intubation 12.2
(Control Arm) 
In this traditional model of OHCA airway 
management, advanced-level EMS 
personnel will use ETI as the primary 
(initial) airway management intervention. 
If the EMS agency is assigned to this 
arm, basic-level EMS personnel will use 
bag-valve-mask ventilation only even if 
they would normally use an LT .  
 ETI Device and Technique 12.2.1
ETI involves placement of a flexible plastic breathing tube between the vocal cords and into the 
trachea. The customary approach to ETI is through the patient’s mouth (orotracheal intubation). 
The operator inserts a metal lighted blade (laryngoscope) into the patient’s mouth to displace the

  tongue and expose the vocal cords. The operator the places the ET tube directly through the 
vocal cords. (Figure 7) 
 ETI Techniques Permitted in the Trial 12.2.2
Conventional orotracheal intubation is the preferred approach for the primary/initial intubation 
attempt. Orotracheal ETI is the most common approach in OHCA. EMS personnel may use video 
laryngoscopy for the primary/initial intubation attempt.  
Alternate approaches to ETI (for example, nasotracheal intubation, digital intubation) are less 
common in OHCA and will not be allowed for the initial intubation effort.  
If the EMS agency is assigned to the primary ETI arm, and an alternate ETI technique is used for 
the primary/initial intubation attempt, the case will be excluded from the study.  
If the EMS agency is assigned to the primary ETI arm, and if initial orotracheal ETI attempts are 
unsuccessful, the EMS agency may use alternate ETI techniques in a “rescue” capacity. 
  Primary Laryngeal Tube Insertion (Intervention Arm) 12.[ADDRESS_1215242] management, 
advanced-level EMS personnel will use LT as the 
primary (initial) airway management intervention. 
Basic-level EMS personnel will use bag-valve-mask 
ventilation. If trained to use LT, basic-level EMS 
personnel may perform LT insertion. 
 LT Device and Technique 12.3.[ADDRESS_1215243] device that is inserted 
blindly through the mouth. The device is designed 
so that the distal end sits in the proximal 
esophagus. A single port results in inflation of 
proximal (hypopharyngeal) and distal (esophageal) 
cuffs. Fenestrations between the cuffs allow 
insufflated air and oxygen to indirectly enter the 
tracheal. (Figure 8) 
King Systems is the manufacturer and distributor of 
LT airways in the [LOCATION_002]. There are several 
such models, including reusable (autoclavable) 
models as well as models with an esophageal port. 
We expect that EMS agencies will use only the 
disposable models of the King LT (LT-D and LTS-
D). 
Use of the LT in adults with OHCA has been 
described in a range of studies.60-62

DO NOT REPRODUCE WITHOUT PERMISSION  [ADDRESS_1215244] Resuscitation Trial  Version 7.0 – November 29, [ADDRESS_1215245] common SGA in EMS use are the King Laryngeal Tube (King LT – 
King Systems, Noblesville, IN), Combitube (Covidien, Inc, Mansfield, MA), Laryngeal Mask Airway 
(LMA – LMA North America, San Diego, CA) and the i-Gel (Intersurgical, Inc., Wokingham, United 
Kingdom). In preparation for this trial, we have collected information on the airway management 
practices of [ADDRESS_1215246] actively participated in prior ROC OHCA trials and 
that indicated interested in participating in the trial. (Table 2) The vast majority utilize the King 
Laryngeal Tube. A small number of EMS agencies use the Combitube or i-Gel.  
The resource limitations of this trial do not allow for subset analysis of multiple SGA devices. 
Therefore, only the LT will be permitted in this study.  
EMS personnel may utilize other SGA devices 
on non-trial patients.  
 Research Procedures 12.[ADDRESS_1215247] interventions specified in this trial 
will be implemented by [CONTACT_870415] (BLS) 
and Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) 
protocols and practices. Customary BLS 
interventions include assessment of pulse, 
initiation of chest compressions, operation of 
automated external defibrillator, and opening 
and management of the airway. Customary 
ACLS interventions include assessment of 
pulse, initiation of chest compressions, 
assessment of cardiac rhythm, delivery of 
rescue defibrillation shocks, insertion of 
intravenous lines, administration of drugs, and 
opening and management of the airway. 
(Figure 9 ) While there is general unified 
approach to BLS and ACLS, some EMS 
agencies have implemented minor 
modifications . For example, while some 
agencies perform an immediate ECG rhythm 
check before initiating chest compressions , 
others first perform 1-[ADDRESS_1215248] 
device until after initiation of intravenous line 
and medications. 
This protocol does not dictate the timing or 
sequence of ETI or LT insertion. Basic- and

resuscitation as guided by [CONTACT_870416]. 
Upon arriving upon the scene of a potentially eligible subject, treating EMS personnel will initiate 
resuscitation measures per local BLS and ACLS protocol. Patient assessment, initiation and style 
of chest compressions, rhythm assessment, shock delivery, intravenous line insertion, and drug 
administration will be performed according to local protocol and practices. 
Simultaneously, EMS personnel will verify eligibility for the trial (i.e., satisfaction of inclusion 
criteria and absence of any exclusion criteria).  
At the point where they are ready to perform advanced airway insertion, EMS personnel will select 
the airway management technique to which they have been randomized (ETI or LT). EMS 
personnel will perform ETI or LT insertion using techniques consistent with local protocol.  
EMS personnel will verify successful and correct placement of the ET tube or LT according to 
local protocols. Customary methods for confirming tube placement including physical examination 
(chest rise), auscultation of chest for presence of breath sounds, auscultation of epi[INVESTIGATOR_870326], use of a bulb syringe detection, use of a colorimetric end-tidal carbon 
dioxide detector, and use of a waveform digital end-tidal carbon dioxide detector. 
EMS personnel will secure airway device in place per local protocol. Standard methods for 
securing the ET tube and LT airway include adhesive tape, umbilical “twill” tape and commercial 
tube holders.64,65  Of note, the LT cannot be secured using an ET tube commercial tube holder; 
rescuers should use adhesive tube or a tube holder designed for the larger diameter of the LT.  
After securing the airway device, EMS personnel will continue with standard resuscitation 
measures. Decisions for termination of resuscitation in the field or transporting to receiving 
Emergency Department are not dictated by [CONTACT_429794]. 
Upon arrival at the receiving ED, resuscitation – including management of the airway – may 
continue according to local practices and protocol. Resuscitation efforts will continue until 
terminat ed by [CONTACT_175302]. If there is restoration of spontaneous circulation, post-arrest care will 
proceed according to local protocols and practice. 
 Protocol Considerations 12.[ADDRESS_1215251] Insertion Attempts 12.5.1
Successful ETI or LT insertion may require multiple attempts. With “attempt” defined as passage 
of the laryngoscope blade into the mouth, Wang, et al. observed that first-attempt success for 
paramedic ETI of OHCA was 70%, with up to four attempts needed to reach the 90% success 
threshold.[ADDRESS_1215252] management techniques. In clinical practice, some EMS protocols 
limit practitioners to 3, 2 or even 1 unsuccessful ETI attempt before proceeding to alternate 
“rescue” airway measures.  
This trial will not dictate or limit the number of ET tube or LT insertion attempts. However, we will 
monitor the number of insertion attempts for each device. Training for the trial will emphasize a ) 
 
DO NOT REPRODUCE WITHOUT PERMISSION  [ADDRESS_1215253] Resuscitation Trial  Version 7.0 – November 29, 2016 
Clinical Trial Protocol   
 
 
  definition of “ETI attempt” as insertion of laryngoscope between the teeth (not insertion of ET 
tube), b) definition of “LT attempt” as insertion of LT airway between the teeth, c) methods for 
reporting the number of attempts for each airway device, and d) strategies for minimizing ETI or 
LT insertion attempts. 
 Unsuccessful Airway Insertion and Rescue Interventions 12.5.[ADDRESS_1215254] interventions. While success rates for OHCA ETI and SGA insertion in OHCA are 
relatively high (approximately 90%), the time-critical nature of OHCA requires that rescue airway 
interventions be initiated promptly.66,[ADDRESS_1215255] EMS agencies may carry additional SGA other than the LT, during training we will 
encourage the use of LT as the preferred rescue device in the event of unsuccessful ETI. 
Alternate intubation techniques (nasotracheal intubation, digital intubation, etc.) may be used in a 
rescue capacity in the event of failed initial orotracheal intubation or LT insertion. 
Some EMS agencies perform needle jet ventilation or open cricothyroidotomy. This trial does not 
preclude the use of these techniques in the event of unsuccessful initial airway insertion.  
 Confirmation of Airway Placement 12.5.3
An important adverse event of ETI is initially unrecognized misplacement of the ET tube, including 
unrecognized placement in the esophagus or hypopharynx. Unrecognized misplacement of the 
ET tube may result in suboptimal delivery of oxygen to the lungs. National consensus guidelines 
recommend the use of multiple techniques for conforming proper ET tube placement, including 
auscultation of lungs (for presence of breath sounds) and epi[INVESTIGATOR_6331] (for absence of gastric 
sounds) , use of an esophageal detector device (bulb detector device) , use of a colorimetric en d 
tidal carbon dioxide detector, or use of a digital or waveform end-tidal carbon dioxide detector.[ADDRESS_1215256] Resuscitation Trial  Version 7.0 – November 29, 2016 
Clinical Trial Protocol   
 
 
   Use of Neuromuscular Blocking Agents 12.5.4
The use of neuromuscular blocking (NMB) agents to facilitate ETI is termed “Rapid Sequence 
Intubation” (RSI). Most OHCA patients are flaccid and do not require RSI. On rare occasion, an 
OHCA patient may develop trismus, requiring the use of RSI. RSI is technique reserved for a very 
small subset of specially trained paramedics . Of the ground EMS agencies in ROC that will 
participate in the trial, few use RSI. Also, an air medical crew capable of performing RSI may be 
present on scene of an OHCA.  
Subjects receiving NMB (RSI) prior to (or during) ETI or LT insertion efforts will be examined in 
separate subgroup analyses.  
Subjects receiving NMB agents after successful airway insertion will not be examined separately. 
 Absence of a B ag-Valve-Mask-Only A rm 12.5.[ADDRESS_1215257], if there is evidence that 
the LT is malfunctioning, immediate replacement with ETI or another SGA may be indicated. 
Replacement of the LT with ETI may occur with a variety of approaches including exchange over 
a gum elastic bougie (Eschman tube), bronchoscopic replacement over an Aintree catheter, or 
removal and ETI using direct laryngoscopy. 
The pragmatic scope of this trial will focus on out- of-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_870327]. 
This trial will not dictate practices for ED management of EMS-placed airways. However, in 
preparation for the trial we will provide receiving ED with guidelines on best practices for the 
management of EMS-placed airways. The guidelines will outline strategies for: 
 
DO NOT REPRODUCE WITHOUT PERMISSION  [ADDRESS_1215258] Resuscitation Trial  Version 7.0 – November 29, [ADDRESS_1215259] care elements: 
- Therapeutic Hypothermia (TH) and Targeted Temperature Management (TTM)  – TH 
and TTM refer to the active reduction and/or control of body temperature. In the context of 
OHCA, TH/TTM is intended to improve outcomes through the prevention of cellular level 
organ damage, especially of the brain. Two randomized trials have demonstrated the safety 
and effectiveness of mild TH/TTM) via external cooling methods in comatose survivors of 
adult VF OHCA.77,78 Another recent trial demonstrated no difference in survival or favorable 
neurologic status between TTM strategies using 33°C and 36°C as targeted body temperatures.79 
We will monitor the use of TH/TTM among enrolled subjects. We will define TH/TTM as a) any 
active attempt to lower and/or control body temperature ≤36˚C, b) continuation of temperature 
control efforts for at least 12 hours, and c) whether a minimum temperature <34°C is

patients enrolled in the ROC PRIMED trials. 
- Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI)  – Up to 71% of patients with cardiac arrest 
have coronary artery disease, and nearly half have an acute coronary occlusion.80-82 There is 
a high incidence (97%) of coronary artery disease in patients resuscitated from OHCA who 
undergo immediate angiography and a 50% incidence  of acute coronary occlusion.81 We will 
monitor early use of PCI within 6 hours of the initial 
OHCA resuscitation . We will monitor the use of both 
coronary angiography as well as interventions (e.g. , 
coronary artery stenting). 
- Withdrawal of Care  – Reliable prognostic factors 
are established after post-arrest day three, but an 
analysis of observational data from an in-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_870328] (DNAR) status or withdrawal of life-
supporting  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_870329].83 In the 
ROC PRIMED Trial, the timing of withdrawal- of-
care varied. (Figure 10) We will monitor the 
assignment and timing of physician order for ‘do  not 
resuscitate’ status or withdrawal of care.  
 Random Allocation and Blinding 13.
 Random Allocation Method 13.[ADDRESS_1215262] intervention will be cluster randomized at the EMS agency level with periodic 
crossover. Each site will be subdivided into multiple clusters by [CONTACT_870417], station, or other unit 
as appropriate to the site’s EMS structure. Each cluster will be scheduled to crossover to the 
opposite treatment – typi[INVESTIGATOR_870330]. The use of crossovers is 
efficient and minimizes unbalanced treatment assignment.  
If more than one participating EMS agency is present on scene, the first arriving unit will 
determine the study treatment assignment. If a non-ROC EMS agency arrives first on scene, the 
subsequent first arriving ROC EMS agency will perform airway management as randomized.  
The randomization of clusters will be stratified by [CONTACT_3725]. Within each site, clusters will be organized 
into relatively homogeneous groups with respect to the number of patients expected to be treated 
over the course of the study in that cluster. All clusters will crossover between  intervention 
assignments at least once (i.e., have at least two distinct treatment periods). If necessary, some 
clusters with high epi[INVESTIGATOR_870331].  
Random assignment of treatment sequence will  be performed by [CONTACT_870418].   
Figure [ADDRESS_1215263] Resuscitation Trial  Version 7.0 – November 29, [ADDRESS_1215264] 
deal with the need for immediate therapy in OHCA. Event level randomization requires the 
preparation of treatment envelopes (potentially biased) or blinded airway equipment pouches, 
which is neither feasible nor practical given the range of different airway equipment used by [CONTACT_108140]. 
Randomization by [CONTACT_870419]-critical nature of OHCA and airway 
management and the varying systems of on-line EMS medical command throughout ROC. While 
the Gausche, et al. trial utilized alternate day randomization (odd day=BVM, even day=BVM±ETI), 
ROC EMS personnel believed that this approach would be difficult and prone to protocol 
violation.[ADDRESS_1215265] trial led by [CONTACT_870420], et al. is randomizing subjects by 
[CONTACT_870421].48 This strategy may result in selection bias and can be problematic if multiple study 
paramedics (each assigned to different arms) are delivering care. 
 Blinding of Treatment Assignment  13.[ADDRESS_1215266] device use d 
by [CONTACT_870422]. Therefore, blinding of the random assignment is not 
possible.  
 Outcomes 14.
 Primary Outcome 14.1
 72-Hour Survival 14.1.1
The primary outcome of the trial is 72-hour hospi[INVESTIGATOR_125739] , defined as patient status 
(alive/dead) at [ADDRESS_1215267] survival to 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345], the use of 72-hour survival as the primary outcome is consistent with the 
pragmatic focus of this trial:88 
- Pragmatic Focus and Interpretation – A pragmatic trial focuses on real-world clinical 
endpoints, with less attention paid to secondary, explanatory or mechanistic endpoints. 
Some EMS and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_870332]- of-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_870333] (such as 72-hour survival) rather than later 
outcomes (such as neurologically intact survival to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345]).  
- Sample Size  – The use of 72-hour survival requires far fewer subjects than more distal 
outcomes such as neurologically-intact survival to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345] (<3,000 vs. >18,[ADDRESS_1215268] Resuscitation Trial  Version 7.0 – November 29, 2016 
Clinical Trial Protocol   
 
 
  - subjects). A larger targeted enrollment is 
not feasible given the resource limitations 
for this trial. 
- Associations at 72 hours are expected 
to be similar to those observed at later 
time points  – In a prior study of 1,[ADDRESS_1215269] majority of OHCA deaths 
(90.6%) occurred within three days.87 
(Figure 11) In our post hoc analysis of 
airway management practices in the 
ROC PRIMED trials, associations 
between 24-hour survival and airway type 
(ETI or SGA) persisted for neurologically 
intact survival to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345]. 
(Figure 4)

- Airway course in receiving Emergency Department.  The purpose of these data is to 
ascertain how the receiving ED utilizes airway devices placed by [CONTACT_870423]. Research 
coordinators will review ED records to determine the course of airway management during 
initial ED resuscitation. For cases arriving at the ED with ongoing CPR, this time period 
encompasses the time elapsed until the

problem was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the investigation 
plan or application (including a supplementary plan or application), or any other  unexpected 
serious problem that relates to the rights, safety or welfare of subjects. The death or neurological 
impairment of an individual patient is not considered an unexpected adverse event in this study. 
 Expected Adverse Events 14.3.[ADDRESS_1215279] misplacement and dislodgements are 
difficult to differentiate; this trial will not differentiate these events. Airway 
misplacement/dislodgement events will be determined from EMS and ED records. 
This event does not include right mainstem intubations. This event does not include 
instances where EMS personnel immediately recognize and correct ET tube misplacement. 
This event does not include ED airway misplacements.  
Misplacement and dislodgement events are unique to ETI and do not apply to the LT. 
- Inadequate EMS ventilation. This event includes instances where EMS personnel a) 
perceive that a successfully inserted airway device is resulting in inadequate ventilation and 
b) therefore opt to change to another airway management device or technique. Inadequate 
ventilation connotes a) inability to insufflate any oxygen (airway obstruction) or b) 
inadequate chest rise on insufflation. Potential reasons for inadequate ventilation may 
include device obstruction, misplacement, malfunction or cuff leak, among others.  
Inadequate ventilation will be based upon EMS personnel assessment, and will be 
determined from EMS patient care records .  
- Airway swelling or edema.  A described complication of the LT is the development of major 
tongue, pharyngeal or hypopharyngeal swelling, which may interfere with ventilation.109 
While usually associated with instances of prolonged LT ventilation (several hours), some 
clinicians have reported the occurrence of this event during resuscitative efforts. This event

  will be based upon EMS and ED personnel assessment and will be determined from EMS 
and ED patient care records. The timeframe for s urveillance for this event will be limited to 
the earlier of a) replacement of the LT with an ET tube, or b) the first [ADDRESS_1215281] x-ray or computed tomography (CT) performed in the ED.  
- Pneumonia and aspi[INVESTIGATOR_169324].  Pneumonia and aspi[INVESTIGATOR_870334]. This event will be defined as the 
presence of an infiltrate or consolidation as reported by [CONTACT_870424] x-
rays or computed tomography (CT) performed during the first [ADDRESS_1215282] automated external defibrillators (AED) and/or manual 
monitor/defibrillators capable of monitoring individual components of CPR process; for example, 
the delivery of individual chest compressions, chest compression rate, interruptions, and fraction, 
and (in select cases) chest compression depth. Currently, all CPR process data files are uploaded 
to the UW CTC. While this archiving process will continue during the study (in order to allow for 
rhythm audits) , CPR process data analysis will not be part of this trial. However, additional grants 
may provide funding for the review of the electronic ECG, entry of data into the database, analysis 
of CPR process data and selected audits.

   Analysis Plan 15.
 CONSORT Diagram 15.1
Figure 12 provides the anticipated 
CONSORT Diagram for the trial. The 
trial will exclude OHCA that do not meet 
inclusion criteria, as well as those who 
do not require ventilatory support. The 
remaining subjects will be enrolled and 
randomized in the trial. 
 Intention- to-Treat vs As-Treated 15.2
The intention- to-treat comparison will 
include the two treatment arms : 
primary-ETI and primary-LT. Where 
allowed by [CONTACT_870405], the primary-
LT arm will allow for BLS LT insertion.  
The as-treated comparison will 
encompass the initial advanced airway 
technique received by [CONTACT_423] , 
whether the airway insertion is 
successful or unsuccessful. Practically, 
this will account for situations where 
randomization is violated; for example, 
use of the ETI when the patient is randomized to primary-LT, or BLS rescuer use of LT when the 
patient is assigned to primary-ETI (and hence BLS BVM ). In cases where rescuers use only BVM 
(without resorting to ETI or LT insertion), this will not be considered a protocol violation, and the 
subject will be retained in the assigned randomization. In cases where rescuers use a different 
technique as the initial airway intervention (other than ETI or LT), the subject will be excluded 
from the as-treated analysis.  
While this trial focuses on two airway management strategies (primary-ETI and primary-LT), in 
execution the course of airway management may encompass other airway management 
endpoints, including BVM ventilation, use of ETI other than orotracheal technique, use of a SG 
other than LT, or use of an another airway management technique (for example, 
cricothyroidotomy). Also, airway insertion efforts may prove unsuccessful, necessitating the use of 
alternate airway techniques. Therefore, a second as-treated comparison will consider the final 
result of EMS airway management efforts : a) ETI, b) LT, c) BVM, and d) other airway technique .  
 Primary Analysis – 72-Hour Survival 15.[ADDRESS_1215284] is 72-hour 
survival. We will calculate the difference in outcomes divided by [CONTACT_639402] “robust” standard 
error based on the Huber-White sandwich estimator in order to account for within cluster 
correlation and variability, which might depart from the classical assumptions.[ADDRESS_1215285], we will calculate the 95% CI for the difference in event rates. Since

 Subgroup Analyses 15.5
OHCA outcomes are known to vary for different patient subsets. For example, OHCA survival is 
approximately 28.4% for patients with an initial “shockable” cardiac rhythms (ventricular fibrillation 
or tachycardia) and 6.2% for non-shockable rhythms (pulseless electrical activity and asystole). 
We will explore multiplicative associations between airway management strategy (ETI vs. LT) and 
the pertinent subgroups, including:  
- Initial cardiac rhythm (shockable vs. non-shockable ); 
- By[CONTACT_870426] (yes vs. no); 
- EMS response time (911 call to arrival on-scene: <10 vs. ≥10 mins);  
- BLS unit capability of performing LT insertion (yes vs. no); 
- Time of airway placement after rescuer arrival on-scene (early [<10 minutes] vs. later [≥10 
minutes] );  
- Use of NMB (RSI) before or during airway insertion efforts (yes vs no); 
- Age (<65 vs. ≥65 years). 
- Placement of advanced airway after ROSC. 
- Initial airway management with non-rebreather mask only (passive ventilation). 
Initial airway management with video laryngoscopy. If 
an [airway x subgroup] interaction is statistically 
significant, we will stratify the analysis by [CONTACT_870427].

0.05 and accommodating up to a 5% loss of precision due to cluster randomization (with 
crossover).  
The estimated effect sizes are based upon observations from the ROC PRIMED Trial. In ROC 
PRIMED, baseline 72-hour survival was 13.7%. There was a 5.0% absolute difference in 72-hour 
survival between ETI (13.7%) and SGA (8.7%) . To account for potential confounders, for this trial 
we will use a more conservative figure of 4.5% to represent a minimal clinically significant 
difference. We designed  the trial to have 85% power to detect this difference. Therefore, the 
required minimum sample size is 2,612 subjects (1,306 per group). To allow for subject 
withdrawal and loss to follow-up, we have budgeted to enroll up to a total of 3,000 subjects.

 Eligibility for Participati ng and Remaining in the Enrollment Phase of the Trial 17.
Prior to entering the enrollment phase of the trial , each EMS agency must demonstrate readiness 
to participate in the study. EMS agencies must also meet select compliance benchmarks to 
remain the enrollment phase of the trial. Specific criteria for participating and remaining in the 
enrollment phase are listed in Appendix 3. 
The trial will not have a formal run-in phase.  
The study leadership will appoint a Study Monitoring Committee (SMC - Section 22) to oversee 
and review EMS agency study compliance. The SMC will meet on a bi-monthly basis to review 
enrollment and protocol adherence. The SMC will have the authority to recommend removal of an 
EMS agency from trial participation for protocol or data collection noncompliance.

disclosure (CC/PD); 
- Develop and test EMS training materials; 
- Establish site subawards. 
A program evaluation will be performed by [CONTACT_870428]. 
 Milestones for Trial Execution and Subject Recruitment 18.[ADDRESS_1215297] 1, 2015 – July 30, 
2019.  
We expect [ADDRESS_1215298] participating EMS agencies to complete a brief period (2- 4 
months) of data collection to demonstrate readiness for the enrollment phase of the trial. We 
expect recruitment of subjects to occur through July 30, 2018 (3 years). Trial close-out and 
analysis will occur during August 1, 2018 – July 30, 2019.

and relationships within a form and between forms. Details and clarification about data  items will 
be provided using pop-up windows and links to appropriate sections of the on-line  version of the 
Manual of Operations. Data encryption and authentication methods will be used.  The DCC will 
build additional features into the web entry forms including: forms transmission  history, access to 
past forms, tracking of data corrections, and the capability to save and re-load  incomplete forms. 
 Database Management 19.3
The DCC will use a two-tiered database structure. A front- end database will serve the web entry  
needs, using a database management system well-suited to handling updates from multiple  
interactive users. The data from this database will be transferred periodically (e.g., weekly) to a 
data repository that can be used by [CONTACT_108250]. These data sets will be the  basis 
for data queries, analyses and monitoring reports. Various versions of this database will be kept as 
needed, e.g., for quarterly performance reports. Backup of data and programs will be performed at 
frequent intervals. Access to data will be limited to those who need access to perform their tasks. 
The database management system is able to manage large quantities of data, to merge data from 
multiple databases as required, to handle complex and possibly  changing relationships, and to 
produce analysis datasets that can be imported into a variety of statistical analysis packages. 
 EMS Research Protocol Training 20.
 Overview of EMS Protocol Training Elements 20.[ADDRESS_1215301] training practices (format, frequency) for both airway devices.  
All participating EMS agencies will receive initial training in the trial protocol. Key elements of 
training will include: 
- Scientific Basis for the Trial –  This section include level-appropriate presentation of the 
scientific principles of airway management, a summary of prior studies of OHCA airway 
management, and the rationale for the current randomized trial. All EMS personnel that may 
potentially carry out study procedures will be required to undergo training.  
- Review of Study Protoco l – This section will include the following: overall study design, 
inclusion and exclusion criteria, the  process of exception to informed consent under

  emergency circumstances, the study  protocol and procedures, data reporting, and 
contingency measures.  
- Protocol Practicum –  EMS personnel will have the opportunity to simulate execution of the 
trial protocol in “hands-on” fashion. This practical experience will encompass the use of 
mannequins that can accommodate ETI and LT insertion. EMS personnel will be given the 
opportunity to practice to proficiency each component of the protocol. EMS personnel will 
have the opportunity to integrate the trial procedures in the context of other ACLS 
interventions.  Various permutations of the study protocol will be presented, including  each of 
the study arms and scenarios with unsuccessful initial airway attempts. 
- Data Reporting –  Select data elements specific to airway management are required for this 
trial; for example, the sequence of airway interventions, the number of attempts, the timing 
of successful airway insertion, and adverse events. The training will review definitions and 
reporting practices for each of these data elements.  
- Cognitive Post-T est – A cognitive post-test will cover key trial procedures and may be 
completed online or as a written or verbal component of the training sessions. A record of 
training completion will be maintained by [CONTACT_870429].

practices for managing EMS-placed airways. This information will include: 
- Overview of the Trial –  We will provide an overview of the rationale for the trial and the trial 
interventions. We will provide an overview of the LT airway and its function. 
- Best Practices for Confirming EMS ET Tube Placement –  Best practices for confirming 
EMS ET tube placement will be reviewed. Emphasis will be placed on a) the need for using 
multiple modalities for confirming ET tube placement, b) the use of waveform capnography 
as a preferred modality for confirming tube placement, c) the use of direct laryngoscopic 
revisualization when placement is uncertain. Emphasis will be placed on the preference of 
maintaining EMS ET tube use over emergent ED re-intubation.  
- Best Practices and Strategies for Managing EMS-Inserted LT Airways –  Best practices 
for confirming EMS LT airway placement will be reviewed. The guidelines will encourage

 Study Monitoring 22.
 Study Monitoring Committee 22.1
The study leadership will appoint a Study Monitoring Committee (SMC) to oversee EMS 
participation and performance in the trial. The SMC will include, at minimum, the PI, the lead co-
investigators, select members of the DCC, select members of the trial workgroup, select PIs from 
participating sites, and select representatives of NIH. The SMC will work with the study leadership 
to develop criteria for EMS agencies to enter and remain in the enrollment phase of the trial . 
Based upon reports provided by [CONTACT_15791], the SMC will monitor EMS agency enrollmen t 
performance on a bi-monthly basis.  
The SMC will have the final authority to authorize EMS agency participation in and/or suspension 
from participation in the trial.  
 Data Safety and Monitoring Board  22.[ADDRESS_1215306] (DSMB) that will monitor 
adverse events throughout the trial and review outcomes data for possible harm. The DSMB was 
appointed by [CONTACT_74379]. The committee will review and approve the protocol before the study 
commences. In addition, the committee will approve an interim monitoring plan before study  
initiation and review the results of the interim analyses. Although the DSMB will make the final  
decision about the interim monitoring plan, we anticipate that the DSMB will evaluate treatment  
compliance and the rate of adverse events between the treatment and control arms at intervals  to 
be determined by [CONTACT_4318], expected to be approximately semi-annually. The DSMB will  also 
monitor primary, secondary and mechanistic study outcomes between the treatment and control 
groups including main effects and a priori subgroups as specified elsewhere in the protocol. The 
DSMB will advise the investigators if a change in the protocol is warranted based  on this interim 
monitoring.  
The DCC will forward DSMB reports to study investigators, the Institutional  Review Board, and the 
sponsor in accordance with the 1996  guidance from OHRP regulations 46.101 (i), as is our current 
practice. 
Clinical staff will report all potential adverse events to the coordinating center as soon as possible. 
These will be collected in both a structured (standard form) and open (describing any difficulties 
encountered) form. All potential  adverse events will be reviewed as to treatment arm and further 
classified by: a) Severity (life-threatening, serious, non-serious); and b) Expected vs. Unexpected. 
Expected  adverse events will be recorded as noted in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_870344], reported to overseeing agencies as required by [CONTACT_571379],  and reviewed periodically by [CONTACT_870430].  
For suspected unexpected serious adverse  reactions (S[LOCATION_003]R), the coordinating center will promptly 
notify the DSMB as well as appropriate regulatory agencies,  site and sponsor. The coordinating

http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/humansubjects/guidance/45cfr46.html#46.101 ), and FDA regulations [ADDRESS_1215309] be administered before consent from the subjects' legally authorized 
representatives is feasible. Cardiac arrest is a short-lived illness, for which immediate 
interventions cannot be delayed without irreparable harm to the patient.  
In conformance with EFIC rules, measures to protect the rights and welfare of subjects will 
include, at least; a ) community consultation , b) public disclosure, c) independent data monitoring , 
and d ) notification of a legally authorized representative or family members of a subject’s 
enrollment in the trial, with opportunity to discontinue trial participation.

   Appendix 4 – Additional Information Justifying the Use of Exception from Informed 28.
Consent (EFIC) for Emergency Research 
We have outlined below how the study design applies to federal criteria for EFIC 
(http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/policy/hsdc97-01.html ). 
  
(1) The human subjects are in a life-threatening situation, available treatments are  
unproven or unsatisfactory, and the collection of valid scientific evidence, which may  
include evidence obtained through randomized placebo-controlled investigations, is 
necessary  to determine the safety and effectiveness of particular interventions. 
The proposed trial is a multicenter pragmatic randomized clinical trial comparing ETI- versus 
SGA-airway management in patients with non-traumatic out- of-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_164132]. These 
patients are in an immediate life-threatening situation with a mortality approaching 90%. The 
standard of care for prehospi[INVESTIGATOR_870378]. 
Endotracheal intubation (ETI) is the insertion of a plastic breathing tube through the mouth and 
into the trachea. As the initial provider of critical care in the field, US paramedics have performed 
ETI on OHCA victims for over 30 years.14-17 However, numerous studies highlight the pi[INVESTIGATOR_870379].  
For example, unrecognized misplacement of the endotracheal tube (in the esophagus rather than 
trachea) has been reported in up to one-fourth of paramedic ETI.[ADDRESS_1215339] studies report paramedic ETI 
success rates >90%, using US national data we observed ETI success rates of only 70%.[ADDRESS_1215340] compressions – including even brief 20-second interruptions – may 
disrupt coronary blood flow, impairing OHCA survival.23,[ADDRESS_1215341] compression interruptions associated with intubation 
efforts by [CONTACT_870443][INVESTIGATOR_870315]. In this series of 100 OHCA, ETI efforts resulted in a 
median of 2 CPR interruptions (IQR 1-3; range 1-6) totaling a median of 109.5 seconds (IQR: 54-
198; range 13-446).[ADDRESS_1215342] perform 
only five (5) ETI prior to graduation.26-32 While the customary setting for learning ETI is in the 
operating room training under the tutelage of anesthesiologists, students at nationally accredited 
paramedic training programs receive only 2-4 days of this training experience.8 Some training 
programs are not able to provide any operating room training. Mannequins do not adequate 
recreate the “feel” of live human airways. 
Regular clinical experience is important for maintaining ETI skill. Using 2003 statewide data from 
Pennsylvania, we found that paramedics performed a median of 1 ETI (interquartile range 0-3) 
 
DO NOT REPRODUCE WITHOUT PERMISSION  [ADDRESS_1215343] Resuscitation Trial  Version 7.0 – November 29, 2016 
Clinical Trial Protocol   
 
 
  annually; 39% performed no ETI, and 67% performed fewer than two ETI.33 In Maine, Burton, et 
al. found that only 40% of paramedics attempted ETI annually, and only 1-2% of all paramedics 
performed five or more ETI annually.34  
Supraglottic airways (SGA) offer simpler alternatives to ETI. SGA in current North American EMS 
use include the Laryngeal Mask Airway (LMA), Combitube and King Laryngeal Tube.35,36 SGA are 
inserted “blindly” through the mouth and sit outside of the vocal cords.37 (Figure 3) Compared with 
ETI, SGAs offer simple and expeditious operation, lower skill acquisition and maintenance 
thresholds, and similar ventilatory characteristics. While typi[INVESTIGATOR_870380], many EMS agencies perform primary SGA insertion.[ADDRESS_1215344] changes in 
outcome.  
 
(2) Obtaining informed consent is not feasible because: 
i. The subjects will not be able to give their informed consent as a result of 
their  medical condition; 
ii. The intervention under  investigation must be administered before consent 
from the  subjects' legally authorized representatives is feasible; and 
iii. There is no reasonable way to identify prospectively the individuals likely 
to become  eligible for participation in the clinical investigation. 
The study interventions need to be administered as an early intervention after the onset of cardiac 
arrest. In this uncontrolled setting the patient is unconscious and unable to provide consent for 
study enrollment. Legal next- of-kin are often not immediately available at the scene, nor is it 
practical for the prehospi[INVESTIGATOR_870381]. Since we are studying out- of-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_164132], which is frequently the 
first manifestation of cardiovascular disease, there is no way to prospectively identify individuals 
who are likely to become eligible for this trial. 
 
(3) Participation in the research holds out the prospect of direct benefit to the subjects  
because:  
i. Subjects are facing a life-threatening situation that necessitates 
intervention; 
ii. Appropriate animal and other preclinical studies have been  conducted, and 
the information derived from those studies and related evidence support 
the potential for  the intervention to provide a direct benefit to the individual 
subjects; and 
iii. Risks associated with the investigation are reasonable in relation to what 
is known  about  the medical condition of the potential class of subjects, the 
 
DO NOT REPRODUCE WITHOUT PERMISSION  [ADDRESS_1215345] Resuscitation Trial  Version 7.0 – November 29, [ADDRESS_1215346] strategy is 
unknown. Compared with SGA, ETI has enormous system-level costs, including increased 
training and skills maintenance burden, and the heightened risk of serious adverse events (for 
example, tube misplacement or dislodgement). If SGAs achieves superior outcomes than ETI, this 
would indicate that EMS systems should switch to SGAs for OHCA resuscitation. If ETI proves 
superior to SGA, this would prompt efforts to optimize current ETI practices. If there is no 
difference in OHCA outcomes, this would affirm that EMS practitioners can select airway devices 
that best suit their preferences or practice setting. 
(4) The clinical investigation could not practicably be carried out without the waiver. 
This study could not be conducted without the waiver of consent due to the need to administer the 
interventions as early as possible after the onset of cardiac arrest. Cardiac arrest patients are 
unable to provide consent. 
(5) The proposed investigational plan defines the length of the potential therapeutic  
window based  on scientific evidence, and the investigator has committed to attempting 
to contact a legally authorized representative for each  subject within that  window of 
time and, if feasible, to asking the legally authorized representative  contact[CONTACT_870444].  The investigator 
will summarize efforts made to contact [CONTACT_870445]. 
Cardiac arrest is a time-critical condition. Victims of cardiac arrest collapse unpredictably in a 
range of public and private areas. Paramedics must mobilize to the patient side, bringing all 
portable monitoring equipment, medications, airway and ventilation equipment. In addition, 
paramedics must coordinate all resuscitation tasks, including delivery of chest compressions, 
insertion of intravenous line, and administration of medications. Documentation of clinical care 
and execution of trial procedures are difficult under these conditions.  
Since this is an immediately life-threatening situation, it will not be possible to obtain consent prior 
to or at the actual time of treatment. A script describing the study will be provided to a recognized 
LAR on scene, when feasible, but it is acknowledged that the acute circumstances may only 
rarely if ever afford such an opportunity. We will make every effort to contact [CONTACT_870446][INVESTIGATOR_856293] a randomized trial 
and provide an opportunity to withdraw from further participation. Although OHRP regulations do 
not require that written informed consent be obtained once the patient is enrolled for continued 
 
DO NOT REPRODUCE WITHOUT PERMISSION  [ADDRESS_1215347] Resuscitation Trial  Version 7.0 – November 29, [ADDRESS_1215348]’s legal representative as soon as feasible and a summary of these efforts will be 
documented in the patient’s chart. If the subject becomes competent during the study period then 
he/she will be approached by [CONTACT_856396]. 
(6) The IRB has reviewed and approved informed consent  procedures and an informed  
consent  document consistent with Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)-  
Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) Sec. 46.116 and 46.117 of 45 CFR Part 
46. 
All procedures and notification/consent forms will be approved by [CONTACT_4707] 
(IRB) of each study site prior to the onset of the trial. 
(7) Additional protections of the rights and welfare of the subjects will be provided,  
including, at least: 
i. Consultation (including, where appropriate, consultation carried out by [CONTACT_5040]) with  representatives of the communities in which the clinical 
investigation will be conducted and from which the subjects will be drawn; 
ii. Public disclosure to the communities in which the clinical investigation will 
be conducted and from which the subjects will be drawn, prior to initiation 
of the clinical  investigation, of plans for the investigation and its risks and 
expected benefits; 
iii. Public disclosure of sufficient information following completion of the 
clinical  investigation to apprise the community and researchers of the 
study, including the  demographic characteristics of the research 
population, and its results; 
iv. Establishment of an independent data monitoring committee to exercise 
oversight of the clinical investigation; and 
v. If obtaining informed consent is not feasible and a legally authorized 
representative is not reasonably available, the investigator has committed, 
if feasible, to attempting to contact [CONTACT_856397]'s family member who is not a  legally authorized representative, 
and asking whether he or she objects to the subject's participation in the 
clinical investigation. The investigator will summarize  efforts made to 
contact [CONTACT_870447]. 
(i) In U.S, centers, community consultation as outlined by [CONTACT_870448]. Since the population eligible for enrollment includes all citizens in the study regions 
it will not be possible to target any particular small group. The community consultation plan for 
each study site will have to be individualized to fit the IRB requirements. Appendix [ADDRESS_1215349] Resuscitation Trial  Version 7.0 – November 29, 2016 
Clinical Trial Protocol   
 
 
  (ii) & (iii) Public disclosures will be performed both prior to study enrollment and at the completion 
of the study in the form of multimedia press releases organized by [CONTACT_870449]. These will include plans for the study including potential risks and benefits and a 
summary of the results of the study upon completion. In the event that the press releases are not 
widely circulated, advertisements will also be placed in local papers describing the study. 
(iv) An independent data monitoring committee will exercise oversight of the study as described 
below.  
(v) We expect that all patients who meet the enrollment criteria will be unconscious. Any delay in 
medical care that would be required for the paramedic to attempt to obtain consent from the 
patient’s legal guardian would be life threatening. Thus it will not be feasible to attempt to obtain 
informed consent during the initial therapeutic window. However, a brief written script describing 
the study (Appendix 5, Section 29.4) will be developed for presentation to a LAR on-scene by [CONTACT_870450][INVESTIGATOR_503736], when feasible, giving an opportunity to object to study enrollment. Because 
the acute circumstances of cardiac arrest rarely if ever afford even such a limited opportunity 
without compromising patient care in process, determine if or when presenting this script is 
feasible, in light of these safety considerations, will be left to the clinical discretion of the provider. .  
The local ROC investigator will provide information about the emergency research study to the 
patient or their representative at the earliest feasible opportunity after administration of the 
intervention and given an opportunity to withdraw from further participation. Once the patient 
reaches the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_870382]. The 
local IRB will determine whether a signed document is desirable for continued participation. In the 
event that a patient or their family withdraws from ongoing participation survival from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_870383].

Please note that the term “you” used in this document refers to either you or your family member 
You had a cardiac arrest and survived. The Emergency Medical System (EMS) providers quickly 
started cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). This includes breathing for you by [CONTACT_4859] a tube 
(an airway tube) into your windpi[INVESTIGATOR_870385]. They may have applied electricity 
to your heart, often referred to as defibrillation, to try and restore a normal heart beat. You were 
enrolled in a research study conducted by [institution] through the Resuscitation Outcomes 
Consortium (ROC). ROC is the largest prehospi[INVESTIGATOR_870386], 
focusing on research in the areas of prehospi[INVESTIGATOR_870387]. The purpose of this notification form is to give you information about this study. You may 
ask questions about the purpose of the research, why you were enrolled, the possible risks and 
benefits, your rights as a research participant, and anything else about the research or this form 
that is not clear. We will give you a copy of this form for your records.  
Cardiac arrest is an extreme emergency during which the patient will die within a few minutes if 
treatment is not begun immediately. Patients in cardiac arrest are unconscious and unable to 
discuss their treatment, and any time taken to discuss their treatment with family robs the patient 
of immediately starting life-saving measures. Because of this and because an airway tube must 
be inserted quickly after a cardiac arrest, you were entered into the study at the scene of the 
event. In this situation, oversight groups who are responsible for supervising and regulating such 
studies, including the [LOCATION_002] Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP), have 
allowed us to enter people into the study without first obtaining written consent. This permission 
was granted only after informing and seeking input from the local community as required by [CONTACT_870451]. These requirements may have included household surveys, press releases, and 
lectures to the medical and lay public. 
There are also other safeguards in place for this research. First, the National Heart, Lung, and 
Blood Institute of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) which is supporting this research, had an 
independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board to review the research to make sure it was 
scientifically sound. The DSMB also monitors the results of the research during the course of the 
study to be sure of patient safety. Finally, a local group associated with the University of [ ] is also 
monitoring the research.

used in the prehospi[INVESTIGATOR_870388]. The two tubes being compared are 1) the 
“endotracheal tube,” which is a plastic breathing tube inserted into the airway (windpi[INVESTIGATOR_5836]), and 2) a 
“supraglottic airway”, which is a tube inserted into the esophagus (the opening to the throat and 
stomach, where you swallow), to block off the esophagus so that air only goes into the lungs. Both 
types of tubes are used by [CONTACT_870452], but prior studies have not shown whether one works 
better than the other.  
EMS providers treat cardiac arrest by [CONTACT_870453] (CPR). This 
includes pushing on the chest with the heel of their hands to help the blood move, and if needed, 
helpi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a person to breathe by [CONTACT_4859] a tube through the mouth into the throat so that air is able 
to reach the lungs. When a person cannot breathe on his or her own, an airway tube allows 
oxygen to reach the lungs and be circulated throughout the body during CPR. 
The EMS providers who cared for you when you had your cardiac arrest are participating in a 
research study to see if we can determine whether one airway tube is better than another. 
Because of the seriousness of your illness and the immediate need for treatment, the providers 
were unable to ask for your permission to participate in the study. However, we told the public 
about this study before it started. Also, the [name [CONTACT_870473]] Institutional Review Board 
reviewed this study before it started and gave us permission to enroll subjects without their 
consent. The study is being supervised locally by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. [full name] of [institution]. This study is being 
conducted in six regional community centers within the US, and will enroll over 3,[ADDRESS_1215353] tubes inserted by [CONTACT_870454]’s discretion .  
As part of this study, we will record some information about you. We will collect information from 
the EMS agency about your medical condition when they arrived, and what care they 
administered to you. We will also collect information from your hospi[INVESTIGATOR_870389], any reports from operations or other procedures you had (such as X-rays or other 
imaging), what medications you were given, and how long you stayed in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  
Risks and Benefits of the Research 
If there is any benefit to you from being in the study, it has already occurred. You will receive no 
further benefit from being in this study. However, your participation in this study will benefit society 
if we are able to show whether one of the two airway tubes being studied has better results.

inserted; however, since this study uses two airway tubes that are currently being used by [CONTACT_870455], being enrolled in this study does not add additional medical risks.  
The risks of insertion of an airway tube include unsuccessful airway insertion, multiple insertion 
attempts, airway tube misplacement (tube is inserted incorrectly), inadequate ventilation (tube 
does not allow enough air passing into the lungs), vomiting after airway insertion, cuts, scrapes, or 
perforations to the soft tissues inside the mouth of throat, injury to teeth, and a collapsed lung.

assure you that your family member received the best medical care currently practiced for 
treatment of cardiac arrest. In addition to the standard treatments for cardiac arrest, your family 
member was entered into a research study called “[Pragmatic Trial of Airway Management in Out-
of-Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_23060]]”. We are writing you now to inform you that this occurred. This was 
done without their consent because they required emergency care that could not be delayed to 
allow adequate consideration of informed consent. No further action on your part is require d. We

   Study Information Sheet (accompanies Next of Kin Notification Letter) 29.3
 
Title: Pragmatic Trial of Airway Management in Out- of-Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_870394] a cardiac arrest by [CONTACT_870464] (EMS) 
personnel, and at [institution]. When he/she was being treated at the scene and in the emergency 
department, he/she was unconscious and/or unable to reliably talk with us about his/her wishes. 
During this time your family member was enrolled in a study called “Pragmatic Trial of Airway 
Management in Out- of-Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_23060]”.  
An Institutional Review Board (IRB) at [local site] has given us permission to do this study in 
which subjects are enrolled without their consent. This process is called exception from informed 
consent for emergency research.  
During a cardiac arrest, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is performed by [CONTACT_870423]. 
This includes breathing for the patient by [CONTACT_870465][INVESTIGATOR_5836], and pumpi[INVESTIGATOR_870395]’s chest. The purpose of this study is to determine whether one of two airway tubes 
that are currently being used is better than the other. The two tubes being compared are 1) the 
“endotracheal tube,” which is a plastic breathing tube inserted into the airway (windpi[INVESTIGATOR_5836]), and 2) a 
“supraglottic airway”, which is a tube inserted into the esophagus (the opening to the throat and 
stomach, where you swallow), to block off the esophagus so that air only goes into the lungs. Both 
types of tubes are used by [CONTACT_870452], but prior studies have not shown whether one works 
better than the other.  
The study is being done throughout the [LOCATION_002] and Canada by [CONTACT_870466] (ROC), of which Dr. [local PI] is a 
member. The ROC is the largest prehospi[INVESTIGATOR_870386], focusing on 
research in the areas of prehospi[INVESTIGATOR_870396]. This 
study is funded by a grant received from the U.S. National Institutes of Health. 
Your family member’s participation in this study will help us to better understand treatment of 
cardiac arrest and how we can improve the care of future cardiac arrest patients. Our study 
evaluates the usual care and procedures routinely performed by [CONTACT_870467] 
(EMS) Agencies throughout the [LOCATION_002] and Canada. If you have any questions, concerns, 
or complaints about the research or a research related injury including available treatments, you 
may contact [INVESTIGATOR_124]. [PI] or [his/her] staff and they will be glad to answer any of your questions. Their 
number is [ local site PI’s number ] .

TITLE OF RESEARCH: Pragmatic Trial of Airway Management in Out- of-Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_870397]: [Local information] 
 
INVESTIGATOR: [Local information] 
 
SPONSOR: National Institutes of Health (NIH) 
 University of Alabama at Birmingham 
 University of Washington 
 
Instructions :  
While at the scene, when the participating emergency medical system (EMS) provider determines 
the patient has met the study inclusion and exclusion criteria, the following information may be 
provided as feasible to the conscious and alert patient, legally authorized representative, and/or 
family member of the patient who has experienced a cardiac arrest. 
The purpose of the study information script is to attempt to provide an opportunity for verbal 
objection to study enrollment or to offer the opportunity to decline further participation, if already 
enrolled, only if the situation is both safe and does not adversely affect patient care and/or 
transport. The acute circumstances should only rarely, if ever, afford such opportunities.  
EMS providers will be trained to attempt notification only in situations when feasible to conscious 
or alert patient, legal representative or family member. 
 
Script: 
1. You (or your loved one) appear to have suffered a cardiac arrest and needs treatment to 
open the airway to introduce oxygen to the body to protect the brain and body from oxygen 
deprivation .  
  
2. I want to let you know that we (EMS Agency Name)  are conducting a research study that 
tests two different types of breathing tubes that are commonly used by [CONTACT_870468]. 
 
3. Treatment needs to be done quickly, but we want to give you the option of not being 
enrolled in the study. 
 
4. If you say no we will treat you (or your loved one) according to our standard protocols. 
Someone will give you more information when we reach the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].

Clinical Trial Protocol   
 
 
   Sample Community Consultation Plan 29.5
The following is an example community consultation plan from a prior interventional trauma study 
that we implemented with the Resuscitation Outcome Consortium IRB protocol, F120425003 – 
Pragmatic, Randomized Optimal Platelet and Plasma Ratios (PROPPR). Participating sites will 
develop individualized community consultation plans for the trial. 
 
A. Goal 
The community consultation process is designed to allow the public to provide input before the 
study begins. Community consultation also provides an opportunity to learn more about 
community members’ understanding of the research and how they weigh the potential benefits 
and risks associated with the proposed study. This requires a clear presentation of the purpose of 
the study, the treatment, the potential risks and benefits of the study, along with the best available 
estimates of the results. 
B. Objectives 
- 1. Communicate with a variety of audiences and special interest groups with the target 
population being 15-45 years of age for traumatic injury. 
- 2. Remind the community of the overall goal to improve emergency care (i.e., improve the 
public’s health). 
- 3. Educate the community that clinical research is vital to improving health care and saving 
lives and help them understand why emergency exception from informed consent is needed. 
- 4. Describe the proposed study and its relationship to current gaps in our knowledge about 
treating critically injured patients. 
- 5. Assess the community’s understanding of the proposed research, associated risks and 
benefits, and emergency trauma care research. 
- 6. Solicit input from community members regarding the acceptability of the study and their 
concerns about the study. 
C. Message 
We need the community’s help to begin this important medical research. Members of our 
community need to provide their opi[INVESTIGATOR_870398]. We encourage dissemination of 
information to the community and feedback from the community. A task force of ROC staff, IRB 
representatives and members of the public should initiate and encourage this important two-way 
communication through websites, newsletters and press releases. 
This vital research depends on the combined efforts of the research staff and the trauma care 
providers at UAB. They have joined forces to improve emergency trauma care in our community. 
 
DO NOT REPRODUCE WITHOUT PERMISSION  [ADDRESS_1215363] Resuscitation Trial  Version 7.0 – November 29, [ADDRESS_1215364] shown potential promise. The assignment of treatment 
will occur by [CONTACT_3364] (i.e., assignment will be random; by [CONTACT_3364]). No eligible patient will receive 
preferential treatment. 
Drawing on earlier studies, the researchers hope the therapy being studied will be better than 
current standard of care treatment. But, this promising treatment has not been proven to be better 
in a large clinical trial. This is the final step before a treatment becomes standard of care. 
There is no additional charge to the eligible patient for participation in these studies. 
The investigators recommend that people who don’t want to participate in the study wear a clearly 
identifiable “Opt Out Of ROC Research” bracelet. It is not practical to pre-enroll study participants 
given the magnitude and duration of the study.  
Our primary goal is community education and informing the public about exception from informed 
consent. The UAB trauma center is the only trauma center in Central Alabama. As such, patients 
from across central Alabama, who are transport by a participating EMS agency, will be eligible for 
enrollment if they meet the inclusion criteria a nd are transported to the UAB trauma center. 
Participating EMS agencies are: Air Methods (LifeSaver helicopters), Bessemer Fire Department, 
Birmingham Fire and Rescue, Center Point Fire District, Hoover Fire Department, NorthStar EMS, 
and Regional Paramedical Services in Walker and St. Clair county will be trained and participate 
in this study. Most eligible participants will comes from Jefferson, Shelby, Walker, St. Clair, 
Talladega, Chilton, Blount, Calhoun, Cullman, Etowah, Winston, Tuscaloosa, Greene , Pi[INVESTIGATOR_148016] , 
Fayette, Bibb, Perry , Hale, Clay and Coosa and counties. 
In conducting community consultation activities, the UAB ROC staff ensures that representatives 
from the communities involved in the research have an opportunity to participate in the 
consultation process. The UAB ROC staff proposes this multi-facetted approach for effective and 
broad-based community consultation and public disclosure activities so that members of as many 
different groups within the local ROC communities will have an opportunity for input.

  Background ( Include relevant experience, gaps in current knowledge, preliminary data, etc.):    
Surgery has been historically the standard of care for advanced pre- malignant lesions and early esophageal 
cancers (EEC). However, esophagectomy is associated with significant morbidity and mortality [1]. With the technological advances of the current flexible platforms in recent years, there has been a growing interest in multiple minimally invasive endoscopic techniques for these esophageal disorders. Endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR), often in conjunction with m ucosal ablative techniques, has been increasingly used for the 
treatment of dysplastic Barrett’s esophagus (BE) and EEC [2], with long- term outcomes similar to traditional 
surgical intervention [3]. Traditionally highly focal EMR is performed of target lesions (e.g. nodules) followed by [CONTACT_40101], however some patient have large, or even diffuse nodularity that cannot be treated effectively with these methods. Wide spread radical EMR (defined as > 50% circumference resection) and more recently, endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD), a technique initially developed in Japan, have been adopted as alternative treatments for the management of advanced pre -malignant and EEC [4-6]. ESD has the advantage 
over mucosal ablative techniques and EMR in that it permits en bloc resection of lesions, irrespective of size; thus, permitting a more precise histological evaluation and possibly a lower risk of recurrence [7,8].   Esophageal stricture (ES) formation is a widely recognized adverse event of radical EMR and ESD. Indeed, ES is the most common complication of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for BE, with a reported 
incidence ranging from 5% to 12% [9,10]. A single-center retrospective study reported ES formation in 67% of [ADDRESS_300348] 50% of their esophageal circumference [11]. Similarly, the incidence of ES development after ESD is between 70-90% when the mucosal defect involves more than three- quarters of the 
esophageal circumference [5,12]. In aggregate, the extent of the esophageal mucosal defect following endotherapy appears to be the most consistent predictor of ES formation.  Prevention of ES development following endotherapy can significantly improve a patient’s quality of life and possibly reduce the potential risks and costs associated with treatment of ES with repeated endoscopic balloon dilations (EBD) [13]. Glucocorticoids have been evaluated as a potential preventive therapy for ES based on their anti-inflammatory properties and inhibitory effects on collagen deposition [14,15]. Several studies from Japan [16, 17] have evaluated the utility of endoscopic triamcinolone injection (ETI) for the prevention of stricture formation after ESD. However, local steroid injection is invasive and can be associated with the potential risk of bleeding and perforation at the newly created mucosal defect.   Oral prednisolone has been shown to be effective as a preventive strategy for ES formation [18]. However, prolonged use of systemic oral steroids can be associated with multiple adverse effects. Budesonide is a synthetic steroid with topi[INVESTIGATOR_900]-inflammatory properties and high first- pass metabolism; thus, potentially 
less systemic absorption and side effects. A modified swallowed viscous budesonide/sucralose slurry has been shown to be safe and effective for treatment of esophageal narrowing due to eosinophilic esophagitis [19]. Given these characteristics, oral budesonide has been explored for the prevention of ES [20, 21]. Most recently Mayo Clinic [COMPANY_002]ster developed a new budesonide capsule formulation. Alike viscous budesonide the budesonide capsule can be opened and the powder can be mixed with honey or pancake syrup. A similar formulation is currently used in pi[INVESTIGATOR_246810].

2. Study Group: Participants will be instructed to  swallow b udesonide 3mg twice daily for eight 
consecutive weeks following endotherapy with EMR or ESD. Budesonide will be provided in a capsule containing 3mg budesonide only b y Mayo Clinic Pharmacy with full 8 weeks supply. The patient will 
require opening the capsule and mixing the budesonide powder in 10ml (2 teaspoons) honey, or pancake syrup.  
3. Patients will be instructed not to ingest any solid or liquids for 30 minutes bef ore and after taking the 
budesonide. . For purposes of this study, budesonide is used off-label but according to the same dose and efficacy as has been demonstrated in other esoph ageal inflammatory conditions. [19] Patients will 
receive a handout with exact instructions how and when to take Budesonide gel. (attached)  
3. Historical Control Group: Consists of patients who have undergone EMR or ESD for similar indications 
as the study group between 1/1/2011 and 12/31/2013 at Mayo Clinic [LOCATION_012]. The inclusion and exclusion criteria for the historical control group are the same as the study group. All data will be 
abstracted by [CONTACT_227490]. Patients will not be contracted by [CONTACT_15328].  Consent will be 
not obtained from this group.  
4. Follow-Up and Endpoints: Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and endoscopic balloon or boogie dilation (EBD) will be performed on demand for dysphagia score ≥ 1 (scale 0-4) if symptoms cannot be attributed to a cause other than esophageal stricture (ES). Dilation will be continued until dysphagia score of [ADDRESS_300353] endoscope during EGD. Clinical symptoms of dysphagia will be evaluated with validated symptom scores (Eckardt and validated dysphagia scores) [22] with phone call at 1, clinic visit at 2 months and at the time of EGD at 3 months. All patients will undergo a follow-up EGD and barium esophagography to e valuate for asymptomatic ES at 12 weeks after endotherapy with EMR/ESD. Patient 
who have severe dysphagia (score 3 or 4 corresponding to ability to swallow liquids only or worse) will be offered earlier evaluation as clinically indicated.   
5. Additional Data: Patients’ perceptions, compliance and tolerability of Budesonide as treatment for 
prevention of ES will be recorded at 1 and 2 month follow up. Presence of esophageal candidiasis at time of EGD. Number of dilations sessions to achieve dysphagia score of 0.

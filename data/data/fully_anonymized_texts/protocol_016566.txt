 Sigh Ventilation to Increase  Ventilator -Free Days in Victims of Trauma at Risk for 
the Acute  Respi[INVESTIGATOR_39053]  (SiVent)  
 
Study PI: [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Richard K. Albert  
 
Background  
 
 The current paradigm describing the pathophysiology of the acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_1421] ( ARDS ) begins with  patients having one or more  risk factor s that 
predispose  them to developi[INVESTIGATOR_862049] (e.g., trauma, inhalation injury , sepsis, 
pneumonia ) as depi[INVESTIGATOR_862050] -hand side of 
the shaded portion of 
Figure 1.  These risk 
factors are thought to 
generate an 
inflammatory response  
that causes  pulmonary 
endothelial and epi[INVESTIGATOR_862051], in turn,  
results  in surfactant 
deficiency, alveolar 
flooding , atelectasis and 
shunt , and the resulting 
hypoxia necessitates the 
need for  mechanical 
ventilation .  Ventilator -
induced l ung injury (VILI) 
is thought to contribute to the pathophysiology  by [CONTACT_862099] ( termed  atelectrauma)  and/or overdistension ( termed volutrauma) that produce  
additional, ongoing lung injury , as well as systemic effects that are termed biotrauma 
(Dos Santos, 2000; Ware, 2000 ).   
  
 Interestingly, however, only 20% of patients have ARDS at the time they are 
diagnosed with one or more of the predisposing risk factors.  In the other  80% the 
onset of ARDS  is delayed by 1 -4 days (median = 2 days) (Hudson, 1995; Hou, 2012).  
While this lag has been attributed to the  inflammatory response taking time to develop it 
is also consistent with the hypothesis that, in perhaps as many as 80% of cases, ARDS 
might be occurring  via a different pathophysiolog ical pathway .   
  
 The following observations  have led  to the development of a new paradigm for the 
pathophysiology of ARDS  as shown in the unshaded  portion of Figure 1 .

 Constant tidal volume (V T) ventilation inactivates and/or depletes  surfactant  and 
causes atelectasis .   
 Mechanical ventilation has been known to decrease  lung compliance in humans 
since  the 1950s  (Wu, 1956; Butler, 1957, Ferris, 1960 ) and Mead and Collier (1959 ) 
were the first to link this change  in compliance  to the development of atelectasis .  
Greenfield a nd colleagues ( 1964 ) were the first to sug gest that the compliance change  
and the atelectasis occurred because mechanical ventilation  depleted , altered  or 
interfered  with surfactant .  Subsequently, numerous investigators  have confirmed that 
constant VT ventilation for as little as 5 minutes  (a) increase s the surface tension of lung 
extracts, (b) increases lung elastic recoil and airway opening pressures  and (c) cause s 
atelectasis , and that these changes (d) are  directly related to the size of the V T, the 
duration  of mechanical ventilation , and possibly the respi[INVESTIGATOR_697] (Faridy, 1966; 
McClenahan, 1967; Forrest, 1972; Wyszogrodski, 1975 ).  Wyszogrodski and colleagues 
(1975 ) and Bailey and colleagues (2008) found  that large V T ventilation released 
surfactant into the alveolar  space but that it also increased the surface tension of lung 
extracts .  Accordingly, they proposed that constant V T ventilation in activated, rather than 
depleted surfactant.   
  
 In a well-known and highly cited  study, Webb and Tierney ( 1974 ) found that rats 
ventilated with large V T and no PEEP developed severe hypoxemia, had a reduction in  
respi[INVESTIGATOR_862052] .  Although  this study is frequently cited  as being  the first to demonstrate that 
mechanical  ventilation injures  the lung as a result of overdistension  and/or cyclical 
airspace opening and closing  (i.e., VILI) , Webb and Tierney  found  no evidence of tissue 
disruption  on histologic examination  and concluded that overdistension  was probably 
not the explanation for the abnormalities  they observed .  Cyclical airspace opening and 
closing was not mentioned in the manuscript .  Webb and Tierney ( 1974 ) attributed the ir 
findings to  surfactant depletion resulting from  the large ventilatory  excursions they 
employed , or to the  absence of PEEP causing surfactant  dysfunction from repeated 
compression of the fluid film as was first demonstrated by [CONTACT_862100] ( 1957 ) nearly 20 
years earlier .  Accordingly,  the findings of Webb and Tierney (1974), together with those 
cited above , suggest that the reduction in mortality in ARDS seen with l ow V T ventilation 
does not occur because low V Ts cause less overdistension, but rather because  it 
cause s less surfactant dysfunction  which, in turn, results in less atelectasis and less 
cyclical airspace opening and closing . 
 
 Surfactant can be separated by [CONTACT_862101],  with the latter having much less surface activity.  Cycling surfactant ex -vivo 
or ventilating lungs  in-vivo or in -situ with constant, large V T converts large aggregates to 
small aggregates and impairs large aggregate function.  Larger changes in surface area 
result in greater conversion  (Veldhuizen, 1996; 2002 ), but compliance and surface 
tension decrease in as short a time as 15 minutes  of vent ilation  even when V T is low or 
normal, with accompanying increases in inflammatory cytokines and histologic  evidence

 of lung damage ( Veldhuizen, 1996; Muscedere, 1994; Thet, 1979; D'Angelo, 2002 ; Chu, 
2004; Myrianthefs, 2006; Bailey, 2008 ; Hauber, 2010; Hong, 2010 ; Vobruba, 2013 ). 
 
Increased surface tension is necessary and sufficient  to cause VILI .   
 
 Clements ( 1957 ), was the first to suggest that surfactant “might be an ‘antiatelectasis 
factor’", that the “long -term stability of the lungs requires periodic replenishment of 
surfactant ,” (my emphasis) and that “the mechanism and speed with which the lungs 
spontaneousl y decrease  in compliance and become atelectatic  (my emphasis) probably 
depend significantly, and perhaps solely, on the viscoelastic parameters of the surface  
films” ( Clements, 1957; 1961; 1963 ).  Young and colleagues (1970)  subsequently  
demonstrated that compliance decreased when lungs were held in inflation  with air at 3 
cm H2O for 20 minutes with no V T.  They attributed the change  to increases in surface 
tension that developed spontaneously  because no change in compliance occurred 
when the lungs were distended with liquid to the same volume ( see the explanation 
provided by [CONTACT_862102]).  
 
 Coker and colleagues ( 1992 ) and Taskar and colleagues ( 1997 ) both found that VILI 
only occurr ed in animal models when surfactant was inactivated .  Bilek and colleagues 
(2003 ) developed an apparatus consisting of two glass plates that were coated with 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_39560] s eparated by a distance that was similar to the diameter of small 
airways .  Forcing fluid between these plates generated large pressure gradients that 
damaged the cells.  When surfactant was added, however, fluid could be forced through 
the opposed surfaces at much lower pressure s and the epi[INVESTIGATOR_862053].    
  
 Increasing endogenous surfactant pools or intratracheal administration of exogenous 
surfactant protects against the hypoxia, the decrease in compliance, the protein leakage  
and the release of inflammatory cytokines that occur when animals are ventila ted with 
large V Ts and no PEEP ( Verbrugge, 1998; Welk, 2001; D'Angelo, 2007; Maruscak, 
2008; Yamashita, 2008 ) and Walker and colleagues ( 2009 ) confirmed this effect in mice 
ventilated with a small V Ts (i.e., 5 ml/kg) and a PEEP of [ADDRESS_1202069] definitive study demonstrating that surfactant deficiency is necessary 
and sufficient to cause VILI Ikegami and colleagues ( 2005 ) developed mice that 
conditionally expressed normal levels of human surfactant -associated protein B (SP -B) 
when they were receiving doxycycline.  When doxycycline was withdrawn  in these 
spontaneously breathing mice , SP-B decreased, surface tension  increased as did 
protein  concentration s and inflammatory cells in bronchoalveolar lavage and IL-1 in 
lung tissue  and 70 % of the animals died from cyanosis and respi[INVESTIGATOR_1506].  If, after 
four days, doxycycline was reintroduced all of these  changes reversed and none of the 
animals died .

 Changes in surfactant and surface tension precede  the onset of ARDS .   
 
 The current paradigm explaining the pathophysiology of ARDS indicates that 
surfactant abnormalities develop as a result of the endothelial and/or epi[INVESTIGATOR_862054] 
(Figure 1).  Hedley -Whyte and colleagues ( 1964 ), however,  noted that lung compliance 
fell within 14 minutes of instituting large V T ventilation in normal dogs, but that shunting 
and the alveolar -to-arterial oxygen tension difference did not increase until 30 minutes 
later.  Finley and colleagues ( 1964 ) found that surface tension fell before  the 
development of experimental atelectasis.   
 
 Large aggregate forms of surfact ant decrease before increases in permeability occur 
or gas exchange abnormalities develop  in animal models of acute lung injury (Lewis, 
1990 ), and surfactant pool sizes and surface lowering activity are altered 1 hour before 
oxygen decreases after institut ing high -stretch ventilation ( Maruscak, 2008 ).  
Thammanomai and colleagues ( 2007 ) found that SP -B levels decreased after 
ventilating normal mice for only 20 minutes.  Importantly, Greene and colleagues ( 1999 ) 
reported that SP -A and SP -B concentrations were reduced in bronchoalveolar lavage 
fluid of patients who were at risk  for developi[INVESTIGATOR_862055].  
 
Stretching  alveolar type 2 cells in -vitro, or giving large tidal volumes (i.e., sigh 
breaths) in-vivo, causes secretion of  surfactant into the alveolar space  and 
prevents atelectasis and lung injury .   
 
 Cecil Drinker seems to be the first to recognize that intermittent delivery of large V Ts 
decreased atelectasis  (Drinker, 1945 ).  In 1928, while observing the first subject being 
tested in the mechanical ventilator devised by [CONTACT_862103]:  
 
"a more interesting matter relating to the comfort of the young man was 
his request that from time to time the respi[INVESTIGATOR_862056] a 
deep inspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], a sort of prolonged yawn or sigh.  This gave comfort to 
him and thought to me…if [man] has rem ained quiet for a long time, 
without the possibility of movement, he indulges often in a long breath, a 
sigh, or a yawn.  The way to treat pulmonary stasis and atelectasis is to 
prevent their occurrence and, thereby, their eventual promotion of more 
seriou s conditions.  This is accomplished by [CONTACT_862104] a few deep respi[INVESTIGATOR_1520] " (Drinker, 1945 ).   
 
 The first report describing treatment of poliomyelitis with mechanical ventilation was 
published in [ADDRESS_1202070] inker respi[INVESTIGATOR_862057]  (Schambaugh, 
1930) .  William Dock, in a 1944 paper entitled "The sequelae of complete bed rest" 
noted that: “patients with air hunger and deep respi[INVESTIGATOR_862058]: ____________  
Site PI: ____________  
Version Date: 2/9/[ADDRESS_1202071] mortem than do those with normal blood levels of hemoglobin 
and base …it is the acidosis and air hunger which prevent collapse” ( Dock, 1944 ).  
Bernstein ( 1957 ), studying rabbits, was the first to demonstrate that ventilation -induced 
changes in lung pressure -volume curves could be prevented by [CONTACT_862105].  His observation was confirmed by [CONTACT_862106] 
(1959 ) in dogs that wer e spontaneously breathing or receiving mechanical ventilation 
and subsequently by [CONTACT_862107] ( Farris, 1960; Caro, 
1960; Egbert, 1963; Bendixen, 1963; Laver 1964).   
 
 In 1965 Pattle ( 1965 ), one of the first biochemists to explore the physiology of 
surfactant, concluded that: 
 
"There thus exists a surface tension, γ 0, at which the free surface energy is 
at a minimum; if the surface tension is less than this, no recruitment of 
material to the  lining film from the underlying complex can take place, and 
there will be a tendency for material to be desorbed from the surface film.  
Any desorption of the surface film will result in a decrease in the internal 
surface area; there will be a consequent fall in the volume at maximum 
pressure and in the compliance calculated from that volume.  Eventually 
collapse of some or all of the alveolar units will occur.   If the ventilatory cycle 
is kept regular, therefore, decrease  in compliance and slow collapse a re to 
be expected …it follows that one of the functions of a yawn or deep breath is 
to recruit more material to the lining film.  If such reactions are prevented 
slow collapse of the lining film, and eventually of the alveolar spaces, may be 
expected.  If a rtificial respi[INVESTIGATOR_862059], the collapse might be 
prevented by [CONTACT_862108]" (Pattle, 1965 ) 
(my emphasis).  
 
 The pool of surfactant in the alveolus is continuously depleted as a result of cellular 
uptake by [CONTACT_862109][INVESTIGATOR_862060].  The loss of surfactant is compensated for by [CONTACT_862110].  Accordingly, regulation of surfactant secretion is cri tical 
for homeostasis such that, if secretion is reduced, alveolar surface tension will increase 
thereby [CONTACT_862111].  Of the various chemical and physical stimuli  that 
are known to regulate surfactant secretion lung distension , working through a calcium -
dependent mechanism (Wirtz, 1990; Frick, 2004),  is considered to be the most 
important physiologically (Dietl, 2005).  
 
 Tierney and Johnson ( 1965 ) also theorized that instab ility of surfactant would cause 
gradual atelectasis during shallow breathing and that “ the alveolar surface film can be 
replenished  by a single deep breath .”  A direct link between the effect of sighs and 
surfactant was subsequently demonstrated by [CONTACT_862112] s investigators who found  that 
large VT ventilation, large gasps in spontaneously breathing animals, single large 
inflations with air or liquid, or even single stretches of type II cells in-vitro all increased

 the release of active surfactant  (Nicholas, 1982; Nicholas, 1983; Massaro, 1983; 
Hildebran, 1981; Wirtz, 1990; Oyarzun, 1990 ).   
 
 Although the beneficial effect of sighs may seem inconsistent with the direct 
relationship between the size of the VT and the resulting surfactant dysfunction noted  
above, the discrepancy is explained by [CONTACT_862113].  Studies showing that larger V Ts alter 
surfactant and increase  surface tension  used V Ts rangi ng from 30 % to 100% of the 
spontaneous  VT that were  administered every breath  for minutes to hours ( Faridy, 1966; 
Forrest, 1972; Wyszogrodski  , 1975; Oyarzun, 1977; Veldhuizen , 1996; Verbrugge , 
1998; 1998a; Maruscak , 2008; Mascheroni, 1988; Davis, 1993 ).  Studies showing that 
large V Ts release  surfactant and inc rease  compliance used V Ts ranging from 130 % to 
400% of the spontaneous  VT, with the sigh breaths given either intermittently or for brief 
periods of time ( Mead, 1959; Egbert, 1963; Bendizen, 1963; Nicholas 1983; Oyarzun, 
1991; Pelosi 1999; Patroniti, 2002 ). 
 
 If ventilation alters surfactant and causes atelectasis, and if surfactant secretion can 
prevent the atelectasis, why have the randomized trials of surfactan t replacement in 
ARDS found no effect on mortality?  Studies of surfactant replacement in ARDS are 
limited by [CONTACT_862114] s 
used, the modes by [CONTACT_862115], the doses being given, the 
frequency of administration and the fact that a variety of proteins, lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], proteases, and 
other substances can inactivate surfactant  (summarized in Albert, 2012) .  In addition, all 
of the studies have been conducted i n patients with established ARDS . The 
pathophysiology proposed in Figure 1 involves surfactant abnormalities developi[INVESTIGATOR_862061] , prior to the time at which widespread alveolar filling with 
proteins, lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], etc. occurs  and alters gas excha nge.  In this sense, the new 
pathophysiology proposed more closely resembles that of the  Respi[INVESTIGATOR_862062] a result of  type 2 
pneumocyte  immaturity .  In this condition surfactant repla cement is extremely effective 
(Einhorning, 1985; Hallman, 1985 ).  In addition, increasing surfactant release into 
individual alveoli by [CONTACT_862116] a far more effective way of 
decreasing surface tension at the alveolar level than a dministering a variable dose of an 
exogenous surfactant into the airway and hopi[INVESTIGATOR_862063].  
 
Relevant clinical trials  
 
 Previous studies of sighs in humans utilized smaller volumes (e.g., two times the 
VT), only administered sighs for a short period of time  (e.g., 30 -60 min ) (Levine, 1972, 
Housley 1970) , or gave sigh breaths more frequently than we propose but over an even 
shorter period  of time (e.g., 3/min for one hour) (Pelosi, 1999) .  Bendixen and 
colleagues (1963) gave a series of three sigh breaths, each separated by [CONTACT_862117] , on one occasion  to [ADDRESS_1202072] sigh was that produced by a  plateau pressure

 (Pplat) of [ADDRESS_1202073] by a Pplat 40 cm H2O and was held for 15 
sec.  Progressive improvements in gas exchange and respi[INVESTIGATOR_862064]  (Bendixen, 1963).  
 
 Biologically variable ventilation (VV) is similar to sigh ventilation, but rather than 
delivering a sigh that is regularly interspersed among constant V T breaths, VV delivers 
VTs that randomly vary in volume over time.  The volume of the larger breaths is similar 
to those given by [CONTACT_862118].  VV facilitates recruitment of atelectatic lung, prevents 
deterioration in gas exchange that occurs with constant V T ventilation of animals with 
normal  lungs, and improves mechanics and gas exchange in various animal models of 
acute lung injury and, in some but not all studies, reduced histological evidence of injury 
(Mutch, 2000; 2000a; 2000b; Arold, 2000 a; Boker, 2002 ; Funk, 2004; Spi[INVESTIGATOR_862065], 2009 ).  As 
was observed with sigh breaths, biologically variable ventilation also increases the 
release of surfactant into the alveolar space  (Arold, 2000 b).  In animals with normal or 
injured lungs VV and sigh ventilation had similar effects on lung mechanics  and gas 
exchange but IL-1 levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of injured lungs were reduced 
more by [CONTACT_862119] (Thammanomai, 2008).   VV has been assessed in 
two human studies.  In the first, Boker and colleagues (2004) randomized 41 patients 
undergoing abdominal aortic aneurysm repairs to controlled mechanical ventilation or 
VV, both of which were continued for six hours.  Patients receiving VV had 
improvements in oxygenation, carbon dioxide partial pressure, dead space, respi[INVESTIGATOR_862066].  In the second, Kowalski and 
colleagues (2013) administered VV for four hours in a cross -over study of eight patient s 
with acute lung injury.  Lung compliance, dead space fraction and the  oxygen index 
improved slightly.  No adverse effects were observed in either study.  
  
Summary    
 
 The rationale for this proposal comes from an extensive basic science and clinical 
literature supporting  a new pathway  by [CONTACT_862120][INVESTIGATOR_69492] 1.  
If this paradigm were  correct most instances of ARDS are actually VILI that occurs 
because constant V T ventilation alters  surfactant  which, in turn, cause s atelectasis and 
provide the setting in which  atelectrauma  occurs.  Adding  sigh breaths will augment 
surfactant secretion into the alveolar space and  could  interrupt this pathophysiologic 
process .  If this study finds that sigh ventilation reduces ventilator -free days it will 
reduce the morbidity and possibly the mortality of victims of trauma who are at 
increased risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_589942].

Version Date: 2/9/[ADDRESS_1202077] is adding  sigh breaths, consisting  of an increase in 
PEEP that produces  a plateau pressure ( Pplat) of 35 cmH2O (or 40 cmH2O in patients 
with BMIs > 35, in patients with moderate or severe abdominal distension from  ascites , 
blood and/or ileus , or prone patients ).  The sigh breaths will be delivered once every 6 
minutes, as part of  usual invasive mechanical ventilation . 
 
 The rate of delivery of the se sigh breaths was selected on the b asis of several 
studies.  Bendixen and colleagues ( 1964 ) documented that the rate at which sighs 
occurred in normal humans was approximately 10/hour.  Mead and Col lier (7) 
showed that sighs given only six times/hour prevented the reduction in compl iance 
that occurred with constant VT ventilation in animals  with normal lungs and Reiss 
and colleagues (2011) found that a single sigh given once every 5 min improved 
mechanics, gas exchange and inflammatory cytokines in normal mice .  Frick and 
colleagues (2004) reported  that lamellar body fusion  preceding surfactant secretion  
that was  increased by [CONTACT_2931] a single stretch of isolated type II cells abated by 5 
min and Steimback and colleagues (2009) found that delivering one sigh every 6 min 
reduced epi[INVESTIGATOR_862070]/min.  
 
 The plateau change resulting from increasing PEEP  producing a Pplat of [ADDRESS_1202078] wall and 
lung compliances, thereby [CONTACT_862121].  Second, a  Pplat of 40 
cmH2O has been utilized in nume rous short -term studies of  recruitm ent maneuvers in 
patients with ARDS  without  any evidence that it caused  barotrauma or volutrauma 
(Pelosi, 1999; O czenski, 2005; Grasso, 2002; Lim, 2003 ; Antonaglia, 2006 ).  In 
patients with  clinically evident abdominal distension graded moderate or severe, in 
those with BMI's exceeding 35, and in those who are prone the volume of the sigh 
breath will be determine d on the basis of a Pplat of  [ADDRESS_1202079] 
reached maximum PEEP and cannot obtain goal Pplat will not be considered 
deviations and the reasons for not reaching goal will be recorded by [CONTACT_3462].  
 
 At present there is only one mechanical ventilator available in the U.S. that is 
configured to provide si gh breaths as d esigned, the  Drager Evita Infinity V500. 
 
For patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation prior to admission to the

Endpoints  
 
 1. The primary endpoint  in this study is the number of ventilator -free days (VFDs) to  
day 28 after enrollment.  VFDs will be counted in the following fashion:  
 
  a. VFD to day [ADDRESS_1202081] period of assisted breath ing to day 28  unless 
a period of assisted breathing was less than 24 hours and the  purpose of 
assisted breathing was a surgical procedure.  
   
  b.  If the patient is  receiving assisted ventilation at day 28 or dies prior to day 
28, VFD will be  0.  
 
  c.   Any VFDs before p atients are placed on comfort care  will be counted.   
   
  d. Unassisted breathing  is defined as the patient breathing s pontaneously with a 
face mask, nasal prong oxygen, or  on room air, T -tube breathing, 
tracheostomy mask breathing, or CPAP < 5 without pressure -support o r 
intermittent mandatory ventilation,  or with the use of noninvasive ventilation 
solely for sleep -disordered breathing.  Assisted  breathing is defined as any 
level of ventilatory support at pressures higher that the unassisted breathing  
thresholds.  
   
 2. Secondary endpoin ts will include the following:  
 
  a. All-cause 28-day mortality .   
  b. The number ICU -free days to day 28 after enrollment   
  c. The occurrence  of complications of treatment (specifically pneumothorax, 
ventilator -associated pneumonia , hypotension requiring pressors, 
pneumatocele).

   d. Percentage of patients discharged to extended care facilities, on mechanical 
ventilation, or to in-patient or home hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6125].

Recruitment process  
 
 Research personnel (e.g., study physicians, research coordinators, research 
assistants) will seek out the senior treating physician for patients meeting study 
inclusion criteria to request permission to seek consent from the patient or, if the patient 
cannot participate in the consent process, from the patient's legally recognized 
representative (LAR) or proxy decision maker for participation in the study .  If the senior 
treating physician agrees, the research personnel will pursue obtaining consent.   
 
Informed consent process  
 
 Written informed con sent will be obtained from each patient, or from their LAR, by 
[CONTACT_862122] a consent form that is approved by [CONTACT_8236]'s 
IRB after the research personnel reviews each item in the consent form with the patient 
or their LAR, a nswers questions and allows the patient or their LAR time to consider the 
request if they wish. If a patient is unable to consent and their LAR is not physically 
present at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_862071], verbal consent may be obtained by 
[CONTACT_756]. T he LAR for all subjects for whom telephone consent is obtained will be 
asked to sign a paper consent upon arrival at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_862072].  
   
 Patients will be  randomized to one of the two study arms as soon as possible, but 
not longer than 24 hours, after initiation of invasive mechanical ventilation.  
  
 All patients meeting the inclusion criteria will be entered in the eligibility form .  If the 
patient is not enrolled, the eligibility form  will include information explaining why 
enrollment did not occur (e.g., exclusion criteria, attending physician denial, patient 
refusal, etc.).  
 
 Research personnel (described above) will be responsible for explaining the study, 
answering questions and obtaining consent.  If patients still have questions the site PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_862073].  The research 
personnel will be responsible for obtaining consent and the Site -Principal Investigator 
[INVESTIGATOR_862074].  
  
 The consenting process will occur either in the ICU or in family counseling rooms 
adjacent to the ICU.

    In the event that  research personnel or the treating physician believes the patient is 
not competent, either because of the condition requiring treatment (e.g., traumatic brain 
injury) or the medications being used to treat anxiety or pain (e.g., sedatives and/ or 
narcotics) consent will be sought from the patient's legally authorized representative 
(LAR ).  All subjects for whom LAR or proxy consent is obtained will be asked to provide 
consent if decisional capacity is regained and will be given the opportunity t o withdraw 
from the study if they do not give consent to continue participating.  If decisional capacity 
is not regained on or before day 28, re -consent is not required. If decisional capacity is 
regained on or before day [ADDRESS_1202082] to decide whether 
they want to participate at the point in time when consent is being discussed.  It also 
states that the patients are free to consider the decision and/or to discuss it with others 
in private, without any study personnel or physicians involved in their care being 
present.  The consent form also notes, however, that the patient must decide whet her 
they wish to participate before they have been receiving mechanical ventilation for [ADDRESS_1202083] 
different local or regional regulations regarding who can serve as a LAR and when an 
LAR is considered necessary.  The consent form specific to each site will be modified to 
include the regulations regarding LARs for each site prior to submitti ng it for individual 
IRB approval.  
 
 If a patient is deemed incompetent or cannot otherwise participate in the consent 
process the same process described for seeking consent from the patient will be used to 
seek consent from the LAR.  
 
Patient Follow -up Pro cess 
 
 Research personnel will see patients enrolled in the study daily until day 28 or until 
the patient is discharged from the ICU, either to another floor in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_663316]. If 
a patient is transferred to a progressive care or step -down unit and continues to receive 
ventilation, the patient will be followed on a daily basis until the patient is extubated or 
dies or until day 28.  
 
 If the patient is discharged from the ICU before day 28  and is no longer receiving 
mechanical ventilation , research personnel will review medical records and/or contact 
[CONTACT_862123] 28  (or the Friday before or Monday after if day 28 occurs on a 
weekend)  to determine if the patient is still alive , discharged from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (and if so, 
when), and whether the patient has experienced any adverse events (see the risk 
management and emergency response section) between the day the patient was 
discharged from the ICU and day 28.

Statistical plan  
 
Sample size estimate  
 
We initially estimated a need to enroll 916 patients in SiVent. This was based on 
the assumption that the number of ventilator -free days (VFDs) in the control arm of the 
study would be 11.[ADDRESS_1202086] dev iation (SD) of 10.5 days. These 
assumptions were taken from a study by [CONTACT_862124], (N Engl J Med, 2006) that 
also used VFDs as a primary endpoint in a study of ARDS patients.  
The actual number of VFDs and SD for patients enrolled in the control arm 
calculated by [CONTACT_862125] 15 days and 9.9 
days, respectively. Using these actual numbers, a power of 80%, and an observed 
withdrawal rate of 1% (which we did not account for in the initial sample size estimate 
but was observed in the first 300 patients enrolled) , we determined that we would be 
able to meet acceptable statistical goals by [CONTACT_79323] [ADDRESS_1202087] 28 days following 
randomization, with the convention that mortality prior to day 28, regardless of when it 
occurs, is equated to 0 ventilator -free days.  This composite outcome, abbreviated as 
VFD28 in the following, has been used in previous studies of ARDS and is 
recommended by [CONTACT_862126] [Schoenfeld D, Bernard G (2002), 
Statistical evaluation of ventilator -free days as an efficacy measure in clinical trials of 
treatment s for acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_1505].  Crit Care Med 30 : 1772 -1777.]   
 
 Because the statistical distribution of VFD28 is usually not close to normal, the 
primary analysis of the difference between the ‘Sigh’ group and the control group can be 
based o n the Wilcoxon rank -sum statistic.  Additional analyses, taking into account 
IRB Protocol: ____________  
Site PI: ____________  
Version Date: 2/9/[ADDRESS_1202088] -squares regression.  Non -normality of 
the outcome is unlikely to influence the results of such analyses because the sample 
size is expected to be in the 300-1000 range (for interim and final analyses).  
   
 Mortality will be analyzed separately as a secondary endpoin t.  ICU -free days (up to 
day 28 , with deaths prior to day 28 classified as having ICU28 = 0) will be analyzed as 
just described for VFD28.  Occurrences of complications of treatment (adverse effects) 
prior to da y 28 will be analyzed using logistic regression.  
 
Interim Analyses; Early Termination  
 
 A Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will be appointed to oversee the 
progress of the SiVent trial and to review adverse events and efficacy.  The DSMB will 
be comprised  of 3 members: one pulmonary physicians, a surgeon who treats ARDS, 
and a statistician .  The members will be independent of the institutions where the 
clinical sites are located.  The DSMB will meet approximately every 6 months 
(alternately in -person  and by [CONTACT_15498]).  The DCC will prepare a complete 
summary of data on recruitment, adherence to protocol, protocol violations, withdrawal 
rates, adverse events, deaths, and the primary and secondary outcomes.  One of the 
responsibilities of the DSM B at each of its meetings is to make recommendations 
concerning continuation, revision, or termination of the clinical trial.  Here we describe 
guidelines for interim analysis of results, with the goal of providing ‘stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_74239]’ 
for the primary out come (VFD28).   
 
 Our expectation is that three formal interim analyses will be conducted: the first 
when approximately 1/[ADDRESS_1202089] been evaluated, the second when 
about 2/[ADDRESS_1202090] been evaluated.  
The mo nitoring boundaries for these ‘looks’ at the data are based on the Lan -DeMets 
‘alpha spending function’ approach.  This yields an overall significance level of 
approximately 0.05.  We have chosen monitoring boundaries in the ‘Pocock’ family 
[Pocock S (1977 ), Group sequential methods in the design and analysis of clinical trials.  
Biometrika 64: 191 -199].  The software is ‘ld98’, an interactive program based on the 
research of K.K. Gordon Lan and David DeMets:  
 
[https://www.biostat.wisc.edu/content/lan -demet s-method -statistical -programs -clinical -
trials]  
 See also Lan KKG, DeMets DL (1983) Discrete sequential boundaries for clinical 
trials.  Biometrika 70: 659 -663.  The boundaries are shown in the Figure below.  
Boundary values are expressed in terms of ‘Z’ statistics. The  upper boundary 
corresponds to stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_48908] a benefit to the Sigh group; the lower boundary would be 
crossed if there is relative evidence of harm in the Sigh group.  We have chosen to use 
asymmetric boundaries, with the lower boundary more li kely to be crossed, because we

Site PI: ____________

Page 19 of 34 
 
19 
 feel that if there is evidence that the ‘Sigh’ group has more bad outcomes, we do not 
want the trial to continue.  Note also that, if the lower boundary is crossed at some 
point, it is highly unlikely that at a future ‘look’,  the upper boundary will be crossed.  That 
is, crossing the lower boundary corresponds to ‘futility’ for the Sigh treatment group.

 The ‘stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_74239]’ are intended as statistical guidelines for the DSMB; the 
DSMB needs to review the sequential monitoring scheme and the boundaries as 
described above, and approve this plan prior to initiating the trial.  Further, the DSMB is 
free at any time to make recommendations that disagree with these guidelines, i.e., they 
may recommend that the trial continue even though the ‘stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_74239]’  have 
been crossed, or to recommend termination of the trial even though the primary 
outcome data are strictly between the upper and lower boundaries.

Confidentiality  
 
 1. Protecting privacy and maintaining co nfidentiality  
 
 All data transmitted to or from the DCC, whether through the password -secured 
website or by e -mail, will be fully encrypted.  Each patient’s  file will contain information 
linking the letter and number with that patient but the patients' nam e, date of birth and 
medical record number will not be transmitted to the DCC.  Individual patient files will be 
kept under locked access at each site until notified by [CONTACT_862127].  
  
 2. Access to study records  
 
 Research perso nnel at each site (i.e., site - Principal Investigator, research 
coordinators or research assistants) will have access to the study data collected for 
each specific patient enrolled from that site and will be able to link these data to each 
specific patient .  DCC personnel will have access to all study data collected from all 
patients but will not be able to link those data to any specific patient.   
 
 Representatives of the Representatives of the [LOCATION_003]MRMC (US ARMY Medical & 
Materiel Command)  will be eligible to review all study records.  
  
 
 
 
Data capture, verification and disposition  
  
 Data from screening and monitoring will be collected on printed paper forms and 
kept in these files.  Copi[INVESTIGATOR_862076] t in the same 
files.  After forms have been completed research personnel at each site will enter data 
by [CONTACT_163459] a password -protected web site.  Clinic personnel can enter and access 
IRB Protocol: ____________  
Site PI: ____________  
Version Date: 2/9/[ADDRESS_1202092]. Only de -identified data will be entered.  
  
 Data are double entered (entered twice) to ensure data accuracy.  Data will be 
edited in real time and personnel get immediate feedback if data edits are triggered.  
The data entry program i nserts data directly into the database at the DCC.  An 
additional and more comprehensive edit will take place nightly at the DCC, which 
automatically generates data queries. Data queries are posted on the study website and 
personnel respond to queries via the website user interface.  
  
 Data management at the DCC uses Oracle Application Server for the website 
software, with an Oracle database to store study data, running on a UNIX  network.  All 
files are automatically backed up nightly, with backup files stored off -site on a twice 
weekly basis.  
  
 The DCC will make available current reports on recruitment, randomization, study 
completion rates, form completion and accuracy, adherence to protocol, compliance, 
serious adverse events and other information, both by [CONTACT_862128].  
These reports display real -time data with no time lag data that has been entered and 
data displayed in the reports.  
 
Data quality  
 
 Each center participating in this study has prior experience with cl inical trials in 
critical care.  While the screen ing, monitoring, intervention and endpoints of the 
proposed trial are simple we plan a n in-person  training session that will be conducted in 
conjunction with the DCC involving the research personnel and site -investigators at all 
centers.

We could find no hum an studies reporting  the effects of administering sighs in a 
fashion si milar to what we are proposing that would allow us to categorize foreseeable 
risks as pr evious stud ies of sighs have uti lized sm aller volumes [e.g., two t imes the V T 
(Housley, 1970; Levine, 2002 )], sighs on ly given for a short period of  time [e.g., 30-60

 min, Housley, 1970; Levine, 2002 )] or sighs given mo re frequently than we propose but 
for a shorter period of time  [e.g., 3/min for  one hour (Pelosi, 1999)].  In addition, the 
largest study we could find on ly enrolled 18 p atients (Bendixen, 1964 ).  On the basis 
of physiology, however, we can conceive of the following foreseeable risks.  
 
 a. Baro - or volutrauma  
 
A system atic review identified 40 studies that evaluated the effects of v arious types 
of recruitm ent maneuvers in patients with ARDS (Hodgson, 2012).  While the  majo rity 
of these studies utilized sus tained infl ations, hi gh pressure-controll ed ventilation, or 
increment al PEEP to achieve recruitm ent five utilized sighs as the  mechanism of 
achieving recruitment (Fan, 2008 ).  These can be examined with respect to safety.  
 
In the  first of these, Pelosi and colleagues (1999)  delivered three consecutive sigh 
breaths/min to a Pplat of  45 cmH2O for one hour to 10 patients with ARDS.  Prior to 
instituting the s ighs the p atients w ere receiving a mean VT of 0.56 ± 0.11  L and a 
PEEP of 14 cmH2O.  Accordingly, the patients had more  severe lung injury that those  
we are planni ng to study.  During the period wh en sigh breaths were delivered the 
VT's increased to 1.1 ± 0.45  L.  Pulmonary arterial pressure d ecreased 2.5 ± 1.9 
mmHg and pul monary vascular resistance decreased 30.8 ± 27.8 dyne•sec•cm-5•m-[ADDRESS_1202094] ances of 
barotrauma were reported.  Th ese small but si gnificant hemo dynamic changes are not 
likely to be  encountered in the study we propose as they were seen wh en three sighs 
were administered each minute whereas we are proposing to deliv er one sigh every 6 
minutes. 
 
In the second, F oti and colleagues (2000 ) raised PEEP f rom 9.4 ± 3 to 16 ±  2 
cmH2O for two b reaths s eparated by 30 sec, twice a minute for 30 m inutes in 15 
patients with ARDS.  Peak inspi[INVESTIGATOR_862079] 35.5 ±  5.4 cmH2O during 
the period in which si ghs were instituted.  C ardiac out, mean arterial blood p ressure, 
pulmonary arterial pressure, pulmonary arterial wedge pressure, central venous  
pressures and oxygen delivery did n ot change.  No  instances of b arotrauma were 
reported. 
  
 Patroniti and colleagues (2002 ) utilized one  sigh breath/min, each lasting  3 to 5  
seconds by [CONTACT_862132] a Pplat that w as 20% h igher than 
the Pp lat und er the control  condition or 35 cmH2O, whichever was higher, for one hour 
in 13 p atients with ARDS.  Pplat averaged 38 ± 3.2 cmH2O during the period when 
sighs were applied correspondi ng to VT's of 1.15 ± 0.3  L that were delivered on top of 
PEEP  levels that averaged 10 ± [ADDRESS_1202095] at to 40 cmH2O (45 cmH2O in those  with a BMI > 30) will 
allow us to achieve  increases in VTs that  are suf ficient to cause sur factant release.

  In a second study, P elosi and colleagues (2003)  delivered three conse cutive sigh 
breaths/min to a Pplat of 45 cmH2O (that corresponded to a VT of 947 ± 3 21 mL) for 
one hour to 10 p atients with ARDS. Prior to admin istering sigh b reaths the patients were 
being ventilated with a  VT of 590 ± 138 mL and a PEEP of 14 ± 3 cmH2O.  No change 
in he modynamics occurred and no instan ces of b arotrauma were reported. 
 
Accordingly, although the numb er of patients studied is small but the literature 
contains no sug gestion that the si gh breaths in volumes that we  propose  to deliver  will 
cause any hemodynamic compromis e.  In addition, using  a Pplat of  35 or 40 cmH2O is 
below that us ed by [CONTACT_862133] p atients who h ad more  severe lung injury 
than those  we will be stu dying and no instan ces of barotrauma were obse rved. 
 
 b. Ventilator -induced lung injury (VILI)  
 
VILI is attributed to overdistension and/or to cyclical airspace opening and closing.  
Low V T ventilation is now the standard of care for patients with ARDS and is thought to 
reduce VILI by [CONTACT_862134].  The lu ng volume produced by  a Pplat of 35 or 
40 cmH2O could r esult in ove rdistension in some areas of the lu ng in some  patients.  It 
seems unl ikely, however,  that VILI could o ccur from this deg ree of overdistension 
occurring on ly 10 times/hour, and st udies in animal mod els of lung  injury indicate that 
such a strategy is protective rather than injurious (Oyarzun,  1977; Mascheroni; 1988; 
Oyarzun,  1991; Pelosi, 1999; Patroniti,  2002).  Nonetheless, VILI remains a potential 
adverse effect.  Nonetheless, we will perform two interim analyses of the data looking 
for evidence that there might be fewer  VFDs in the intervention arm of the study than 
in the control (i.e., a result opposite to the one hypothesized) and the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_862080] (see above).   In 
addition, r espi[INVESTIGATOR_862081], on at least a daily basis, confirm that the sigh 
breaths being delivered do not result in a Pplat that exceeds 40 cm H2O ([ADDRESS_1202096] wall compliance as described above).  Adjustments in 
the volumes or Pplat will be made as needed.  In addition t hese pressures will be 
rechecked whenever the  treating  physician  is concerned about a change in the 
patient’s clinical status.  The frequency with which these adjustments are needed will be 
recorded.    
 
 c. Patient -ventilator dyssynchrony  
 
Although people take sigh breaths approximately 10 times/hour under normal 
circumstances (Bendixen, 1964) and intermittent sigh s for short periods of time have 
been used in patients with ARDS without apparently causing any dyspnea or 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_862082], sigh breaths could conceivably result in patient -ventilator 
dyssynchrony.   
 
Patient -ventilator dyssynchrony is common in patients with ARDS because they are 
receiving low VT ventilation.  This dyssynchrony is frequently managed by [CONTACT_862135]: ____________  
Site PI: ____________  
Version Date: 2/9/2020  
Page 25 of 34 
 
25 
 sedation or even resulting to use of paralytics.  Accordingly, it is equally conceivable, 
that sigh ventilation could decrease  patient -ventilator dyssynchrony.   If patient -
ventilator dyss ynchrony is occurring at an increased frequency in the intervention arm 
of this study it will be manifested by [CONTACT_862136]/or 
analgesics and we will monitor the use of these two medication classes on a daily basis 
with the results being made available to the DSMB for their periodic reviews.  
 
We can think of no other psychological, legal, social, economic or physical risk that 
might be associated with receiving sigh breaths once every six minutes.  
 
Risk management and emergen cy response  
 
a. Research  Monitor  
 
[CONTACT_862144], Professor of Medicine, Anesthesia and Critical Care  at the 
University of Chicago Biological Sciences will serve as both the chair of the Data 
Safety Monitoring Board  (DSMB)  and the research monitor. [CONTACT_38845]’s role may include 
observing recruitment , enrollment , and consent as well as study interactions with 
subjects.  In addition, he may work with the DCC to review monitoring plans, data 
collection, and analysis . As research monitor, he has the authority to discuss the 
research protocol with the investigators, interview human subjects, and consult with 
others outside of the study about the research. [CONTACT_38845] will also have the authority to 
take any steps necessary to protect t he well -being of human subjects until the IRB(s) 
can assess his concerns, including stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_862083]. [CONTACT_38845] will be required to p romptly report any observations  
and findings to the IRB or other desi gnated official and the HRPO.  
 
b. Surveillance and reporting  
 
 Each patient will be seen daily by [CONTACT_862137] [ADDRESS_1202097] occurred they 
will be recorded on the adverse event case report form.   Whether a patient 
experiencing an adverse event continues on the study or is withdrawn will be decided 
by [CONTACT_1963].  
 
If the patient is discharged from the ICU before day 28  and is no longer receiving 
mechanical ventilation , research personn el will review medical records and/or contact 
[CONTACT_170059]: ____________  
Site PI: ____________  
Version Date: 2/9/[ADDRESS_1202098] (IRB) will also be informed in a 
timely manner. The investigator will then submit a detailed, written report to the DCC 
and to the IRB no later than five days after the inve stigator discovers the event.  
 
The DCC will report all serious, unexpected and study -related adverse events to 
the DSMB by [CONTACT_862138]. A written report will be 
sent to the DSMB within 15 calendar days and these reports will be sent to 
investigators for submission to their respective IRBs. The DSMB will also review all 
adverse events during each scheduled interim analysis. The DCC will distribute the 
written summary of the DSMB's periodic review of adverse events to investigators for 
submission to their respective IRBs.  
 
All patients in this study will be hospi[INVESTIGATOR_862084] .  Accordingly, 
emergency care will be readily available at all times.  The cost of treatment for all 
study -related adverse events will be cover ed by [CONTACT_862139][INVESTIGATOR_307].  
 
Potential benefits  
  
 Numerous studies in the literature document that (a) constant V T ventilation depletes 
and/or inactivates surfactant, (b) loss of surfactant increases surface tension and 
predisposes to airspace collapse, (c) having airspace collapse predisposes the lung to 
VILI as a result of cyclical airspace opening and closing, (d) VILI increases the mortality 
of patients with ARDS and (e) sigh breaths are known to cause surfactant secretion 
from type [ADDRESS_1202099] VILI.  Accordingly, adding sigh 
breaths should decrease VILI  and increase the number o f VFDs .  If this occurs, the 
incidence, severity and mortality of ARDS should all decrease.

A Phase III Randomized, Multicenter Trial  
Testing Whether Exercise or Stress Management Improves  
Functional Status  and Symptoms of Autologous and Allogeneic Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_617272]: Stephanie J. Lee, M.D., M.P.H. 
 Paul Jacobsen, Ph.D. 
 Study Design:    Phase III, randomized, unblinded, multicenter, prospective comparative study of exercise, stress management, the  combination 
of exercise and stress management versus standard care to improve functional status and  symptoms. 
Patients complete baseline measures and are randomized to one of the four arms, stratified by [CONTACT_617300] (autologous /syngeneic, myeloablative allogeneic, reduced 
intensity/non- ablative allogeneic).  The exercise and stress 
management interventions are designed to be self -administered after 
a brief, 10-15 minute training session.   
Endpoint assessment will occur at 100 d ays +/ - 14 days and 6 months 
+/- one month 
 
Primary Objective:   To determine whether exercise or stress management improves self -
reported physical and mental functioning compared to standard care 
at 100 days using an intention to treat analysis 
 
Secondary Objectives:  a) To determine whether exercise or stress management improves 
physical and mental functioning compared to standard care at 100 days, limiting the analysis to patients who survive and provide a Day 100 self- assessment (condi tional analysis with  main effects)  
 b) To compare physical and mental functioning among the 4 groups 
using pair -wise comparisons, limiting the analysis population to 
patients who provide a Day  100 self -assessment ( pair-wise 
conditional analysis) 
 c) To compare symptoms (fatigue, pain, sleep, nausea, cancer and 
treatment distress ) at 100 days among patients who provide a Day  
100 self- assessment (conditional analysis)  
d) To compare the number of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_617273] 100 days 
e) To assess durability of effects by [CONTACT_617301] 6 months 
f) To compare overall survival at 6 months

iii  
Eligibility:  Inclusions : 
a) Age 18 years or older. 
b) Able to speak and read English. 
c) Able to exercise at low to moderate intensity  - a dequate 
cardiopulmonary reserve, as judged by [CONTACT_6270]-reported ability to 
walk up one flight of stairs, no requirement for supplemental 
oxygen, and physician judgment. 
d) Willing and able to provide informed consent. 
e) Stated willingness to comply with study procedures and reporting requirements. 
f) Planned autologous or allogeneic transplantation within 6 
weeks.  
 
Exclusions:  
a) Orthopedic, neurologic or other problems which prevent safe 
ambulation and protocol adherence. 
b) Participation in another clinical trial with quality of life or functional status as a primary endpoint. 
c) Planned anti -cytotoxic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] , other than TKI, Gleevac or 
Rituximab OR unless  pre-approved by [CONTACT_407], within 
[ADDRESS_819743]-transplant. 
d) Planned DLI within [ADDRESS_819744]-transplant. 
e) Planned tandem transplant (autologous/autologous or autologous/allogeneic). 
 Treatment Description:  Exercise. The goal is to have participants exercise by [CONTACT_270876] [ADDRESS_819745] 20 to 30 minutes at a maximum intensity of 50 to 75% of their estimated heart rate reserve.     
Stress management. The goal is to have participants practice paced 
abdominal breathing, progressive muscle relaxation with guided imagery, and use of copi[INVESTIGATOR_52497]- statements  to decrease stress.  
Standard care will follow institutional gu idelines that reflect  
standard practices  
All 4 groups will receive a general informational DVD about hematopoietic cell transplantation.  
 Accrual Objective:  700 subjects will be randomized approximately 1:1:1:1 across the 
four study arms. 
 Accrual Period:  The estimated accrual pe riod is 36 months.

iv  
Study Duration:  Patients will be followed for 6 months after transplantation.  
 Statistical issues:  The primary objective s of the study are to compare physical 
functioning and mental functioning between the groups who do or do not receive exercise training and between the groups who do or do not receive stress management training (factorial design).  The 
sample size calculation is based upon having 85% power to detect 
differences of 0.5 STD in the primary endpoint between groups 
(exerci se vs. no exercise or stress management vs. no stress 
management) after splitting the type I error rate across these 4 primary comparisons.  This analysis controls for baseline assessment 
and clinical characteristics  and accounts for cancelled transplants and 
missing data using an Intention- to-Treat analysis .  Randomization 
will be stratified for balance based on center and type of transplant (autologous, myeloablative allogeneic, and non- myeloablative 
allogeneic groups).

 1. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
 The adverse effects of hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) on short and long term quality of life are well documented (reviewed in Pi[INVESTIGATOR_43221]
1).  Patients experience numerous aversive 
symptoms (e.g., nausea, fatigue, and sleep disturbance) that are accompanied by [CONTACT_617302] -being.  Although most longitudinal studies show return to baseline 
functioning for the majority of patients, it may take [ADDRESS_819749] of exercise training interventions is more variable; most studies report physical health benefits, with some studies also reporting mental health benefits.  Small studies suggest that combining stress management training and exercise are feasible and well -tolerated, but whether 
the combination provides  an additive or synergistic impact on quality of life outcomes has not 
been directly investigated.    The purpose of this study is to test whether exercise or stress management training delivered to autologous and allogeneic HCT patients prior to transplantation can improve functional status and the transplant experience.  
 1.1. Exercise  
 A [ADDRESS_819750] involved isolated aerobic exercise programs such as walking, recumbent biking or treadmills and occurred during or after 
the transplantation process; strength training and combined strategies were evaluated less often.  Significant benefits were reported for physical performance, quality of life, and fatigue.
[ADDRESS_819751] been proposed to account for the beneficial effects of exercise on qu ality of life in people with cancer.
21 
 The University of Minnesota conducted a randomized trial of a structured walking regimen on a treadmill at a dosage of 15 minutes twice daily while in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_617274] 30 minutes of walking daily after discharge.  Results in 122 patients showed a smaller decline in Karnofsky performance status in the exercise group compared to control patients which was not statistically significant in the whole group but was statistically significant in the subset of older and less fit patients receiving non- ablative conditioning (p=0.04).  Compliance was excellent with 93% in 
the exercise arm exercising during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_210346] 58% in the control arm.  There were no differences in length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_617275], but all trends favored the exercise group.

1.2. Stress Management  
Many studies suggest that professionally adm inistered stress management training including 
progressive muscle relaxation training with guided imagery22 and hypnosis23 are effective in 
relieving nausea, vomiting and emotional distress in the period just before chemotherapy administration.   A systematic review
24 identified two possible mechanisms  for the effects of 
stress management : physiological relaxation and enhanced perceptions of self -efficacy and 
mastery.  Both effects would seem highly beneficial to patients undergoing HCT.  However, very 
few stud ies of stress management training have been performed in the HCT population. 
 Stress management does not have to be professionally directed.  An important study compared professionally delivered stress management to self -administered training.
25  The training was 
similar to the proposed intervention in our trial, including instruction in thre e techniques 
(abdominal breathing, progressive muscle relaxation training with guided imagery, and copi[INVESTIGATOR_52497]-statements) found to be effective in improving quality of life in a variety of clinical

26-28  In the professionally administered form, training was provided during a 60-
minute session conducted by a mental health professional.  In the patient self -administered form, 
training was provided via materials distributed by a mental health prof essional .  Only the self -
administered form was superior to usual care in improving quality of life.  Moreover, costs of this intervention were 68% less than average costs of other professionally administered stress management interventions for chemotherapy patient s.  Table 1.2 summarizes the relevant

 Patients may be included in  this trial if they meet all of the following criteria: 
 
1. Age 18 years or older – the interventions and assessment tools have not been validated 
for children . 
2. Able to speak and read English – interaction with the interventionist trainer  and endpoint 
measurement must occur i n English.  If the interventions are proven effective, then 
additional studies to create and validate a culturally appropriate intervention will be required. 
3. Able to exercise at low to moderate intensity – current participation in a supervised or 
unsupervi sed exercise program is allowed.  
4. Adequate cardiopulmonary reserve, as judged by [CONTACT_6270] -reported ability to walk up one 
flight of stairs , no need for supplemental oxygen, and physician judgment. 
5. Willing and able to provide informed consent. 
6. Stated willingness  to comply with study procedures and reporting requirements. 
7. Planned autologous or allogeneic transplantation within 6 weeks. 
 2.3.2. Patient Exclusion Criteria  
 Patients will be excluded from this trial if they meet any of the following criteria: 
1. Orthopedic, neurologic or other problems which prevent safe ambulation and protocol adherence. 
2. Participation in another clinical trial with quality of life or functional status as a primary endpoint. 
3. Planned anti-cytotoxic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], other than TKI, Gleevac or Rituximab OR unless pre-approved by [CONTACT_36476], within [ADDRESS_819780]-transplant.  
5. Planned tandem transplant (autologous/autologous or autologous/allogeneic). 
 2.4. Interventions  
 All intervention groups require  that pa rticipants have access to a DVD player to watch the video 
materials.  For those few patient s without such access, we will e nsure that they are able to view 
the DVD in the clinic .  The stress management group requires  a CD player.  Almost all 
participants a re expected to own  such equipment or ha ve ready access to it.  Descriptions of the 
interventions are in section 2.4.1- 2.4.4 below. Additional details are found in section 4.3. All 
“Day +X” refer to “days post transplant,” for example, “Day 30 +/ - 7 days” r efers to 30 +/ - 7

audiotape (or CD if preferred), brochure, and workbook.  Participants will be instructed to first 
view the 15 minute videotape and then follow brochure directions about further training, practice, and use of  stress management techniques.  The videotape and brochure discuss sources 
and manifestations of stress during treatment and potential benefits of using stress management 
techniques.  They also provide brief instruction in paced abdominal breathing, progressive muscle relaxation with guided imagery, and use of copi[INVESTIGATOR_52497] -statements, as well as 
recommendations for practicing these techniques.  Testimonials about the benefits of stress management training provided by [CONTACT_617310].  The paced breathing exercise follows a format similar to tha t developed by [CONTACT_617311].

research purposes.    On Day 30 +/ - [ADDRESS_819788] will meet with the participant briefly to answer 
any questions about the intervention, encourage the continued use of stress management 
techniques as recommended, and monitor for any adverse reactions to use of the techniques.  To minimize contamination across intervention conditions, participants randomized to S tress 
Management will be provided with only general feedback about fitness testing and only general 
advice about exercise during transplant (i.e., to maintain any usual patterns of exercise to the 
extent possible).  The interventionist will meet with the p atient again in person or by [CONTACT_617313] 60 +/ - [ADDRESS_819789], along with a brief  (15 minute)  personalized introduction to the interventions .

is approximately [ADDRESS_819794] will briefly discuss the topi[INVESTIGATOR_617290].  To minimize contamination across intervention conditions, participants randomized to the control group will be provided with only general advice about exercise and stres s 
management during treatment  (i.e., to maintain any usual patterns of exercise to the extent 
possible and to continue using any techniques they currently use to manage stress).   All groups (exercise, stress management, combined exercise and stress management, and control) will receive the same general transplant DVD.  
 2.4.5. Training of Interventionist 
 It is anticipated that designated inte rventionists will be research personnel trained as physicians, 
nurses or nurse practitioners, physician assistants, social workers, research assistants, data managers or other persons familiar with HCT.  A center must designate two individuals who will be trained to provide instructions about the intervention to study participants.  The requirement 
for two trained interventionists per center is to ensure availability throughout the enrollment period, and also to allow one interventionist to deliver the patient training and the other to collect outcome measures if necessary.  Ideally, each center will designate a third person, uninvolved 
with intervention delivery, to collect patient-reported outcomes.   Prior to enrollment of the first participant, the inter ventionists will undergo extensive traini ng 
under the supervision of Protocol Team members that includes instruction in how to implement protocols for introducing each intervention, explaining intervention materials, identifying a recommended duration and intensity of exercise, and answering questions during the initial contact.  Training will also include review of protocols for telephone contacts and follow -up 
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK   Exercise and Stress Reduction – Protocol 0902  
Version 2.0 dated March 30, 2011  
 
 
2-6 contacts with participants.  A key element of the training will be instruction in how to avoid 
contamination among the intervention conditions.  Interventionists will only be recorded with 
subjects enrolled in the study.   
 2.4.6. Quality Control of Intervention D elivery  
 Some intervention sessions will be audio taped during the study for quality control to verify the 
intervention is delivered properly.  Sites will be informed of the selection process for selecting 
the interventions to audio tape.  The Protocol Team Member, who will evaluate the 
interventions, will provide feedback to the interventionists at  sites.  
Interventionists at participating 
centers should adhere to the “BMT CTN 0902 Evaluation of Intervention Delivery SOP” for guidelines 
regarding selection process of the interventions to be taped and feedback from the evaluator.   In addition, 
the tw o trained interventionists at each center should use the Fidelity Checklists to ensure all the 
requirements of an intervention are met, as explained in the SOP.   
 
2.5. Stem Cell Transplantation  
 Patients may receive any type of transplant conditioning, any type of stem cell source and donors 
may be HLA -matched or mismatched.  Prior transplantation is allowed.  Syngeneic donors are 
allowed and will be included in the stratum of autologous procedures.  Graft -versus- host disease 
prophylaxis, graft engineering, monitoring for and treatment of complications and supportive care will be per institutional standards.  Definitions of myeloablative and reduced 
intensity/nonmyeloablative conditioning regimens for the purposes of stratification and randomization will be per Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research definitions.  2.6. Design Rationale 
 In planning the current study, several alternative methodological approaches were considered 
but not adopted.   
• Dose intensity of the exercise intervention : The m ost successful exercise interventions 
generally involve a more intensive exercise program including personal trainers, personal exercise equipment, strength plus aerobic training and increased contact [CONTACT_617316].  However, these approaches are not currently feasible within the personnel and financial constraints of transplant centers, so the intervention could not be widely disseminated.  We envision the current study as a test of dissemination.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_617291], almost none provide formal exercise training or use home- based exercise programs.  
• Delivery of the intervention:  The Protocol Team opted for interventions that are self -
administered after a brief training session based on two considerations.  First, as noted above for exercise, an intensive delivery system in not feasible within current center resources.  Second, two randomized studies, one testing an exercise intervention
33 and 
one evaluating stress management training,25 found greater effects with the self -
administered interventions than supervised programs. 
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK   Exercise and Stress Reduction – Protocol 0902  
Version 2.0 dated March 30, 2011  
 
 
2-7 • Delay of intervention delivery:  Many quality of life intervention programs target a 
period la ter after transplantation, both for practical as well as scientific reasons.  
Favoring delayed study is the fact that the period of greatest toxicity is likely to be 
immediately post- transplant, interfering with participants’ ability to use the interventio ns 
effectively.  Acute toxicity and early mortality may make it difficult to discern any intervention benefits.  Differences in early mortality and complication rates among patient subpopulations may add unwanted noise.  Arguments for early delivery include that other exercise and stress management studies have detected benefits of interventions applied early during the transplant process.  From a practical perspective, it is easier to enroll patients prior to transplant and train them in use of the interve ntions.  It is also 
possible that use of the intervention prior to admission could increase the efficacy of the intervention once transplant commences. 
• Objective measures of intervention use:  The use of objective measures of intervention 
use rather than subjective self -report use of interventions was considered.  Although 
wrist -worn actigraphs which measure actual activity could be used for this purpose, we 
were concerned about the feasibility and expense of outfitting study participants with 
this equipment.  Previous studies of cancer patients employing actigraphs have been characterized by [CONTACT_617317] .
38,39  Daily patient diaries were considered 
but deemed too burdensome in this population.  As this is primarily an effectiveness trial of dissemination based on solid preliminary studies, we felt that the extra costs and logistical difficulties did not justify the information to be learned.  
• Objective endpoint measures: The use of objective measures of physical and mental functioning was considered.  Physiologic testing through exercise stress tests require special equipment and personnel, and are time consuming and costly.  We considered measurement of a [ADDRESS_819795], but this would add burden to the 
participants and sites, and may not be feasible in busy clinical areas.  
• Timing of endpoint assessment:  The primary endpoint could be assessed earlier or later 
than [ADDRESS_819796] of the intervention due to treatment -related morta lity, relapse, loss to follow up and other 
events.  
• Analytic design:  An intention- to-treat analysis which assigns functional scores to 
patients who either die before endpoint assessment or who fail to provide [ADDRESS_819797] conservative estimate of the interventions’ effectiveness.  Because of the large number of anticipated deaths and missing Day 100 data severely inflates the target sample size, the 
primary analysis will exploit the factorial design and collapse groups according to the 
intervention being tested (stress management vs. no stress management, exercise vs. no exercise).  A critical secondary analysis will address the clinical question of whether one 
or more of the intervention arms improve functional status and symptoms among 
patients who survive using pairwise comparisons. 
• Exclusion of children:  We designed the study for adults since the interventions and 
many of the instruments are only validated in adults.  It is possible, perhaps likely, that 
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK   Exercise and Stress Reduction – Protocol 0902  
Version 2.0 dated March 30, 2011  
 
 
2-8 adolescents may need a different approach to stress management and exercise than these 
self-directed interventions, and we were reluctant to extrapolate from adult to 
adolescents without appropriate validation studies. 
 2.7. Study R isks 
 Medical risks of study participation are expected to be low but could conceivably be due to exercise participation such as an exercise- related musculoskeletal injury.  Adverse events due to 
exercise participation will be reported.  There is a very lo w risk that the patient -reported 
measures or practice of stress management techniques might actually increase patient distress.  If a member of the study team becomes aware of psychosocial distress, they will notify the patient’s clinical provider who will assess the patient and make appropriate referrals according 
to standard institutional practice.  Increased psychosocial distress due to study participation will be considered a severe adverse event and will be reportable; distress incidentally noted will not be reported to research entities.  For example, a participant reporting distress but not attributing 
it to study participation will be considered “incidentally noted distress.”  If distress is attributed 
to study participation by [CONTACT_102], then it w ill be considered a severe adverse event.  
 We do not expect the biobehavioral interventions under study to be related to engraftment, graft -
vs-host disease, infections, relapse or organ complications such as pulmonary, hepatic, 
neurologic etc.  These compl ications are seen after allogeneic and autologous HCT and are very 
unlikely to be biologically associated with study participation.  These types of transplant -related 
complications will be considered expected events for the purposes of this study.  In addi tion, 
exercise or stress management complications, as described above such as musculoskeletal injury or increased awareness of stress, are considered expected.  
 Unexpected severe adverse events are events related to participation in exercise or stress management that are plausibly related to study participation.  For example, development of an 
arrhythmia during exercise or falling and breaking a hip during exercise are considered unexpected severe adverse events.  
 2.8. Study Benefits  
 It is unknown whether study participants will experience any benefits.  We hope that functional status will be improved and symptoms will be lessened by [CONTACT_617318].   2.9. Study Withdrawal  
 Subjects may be withdrawn from study participation if the treating physician believes it  is in the 
patient’s best interest to cease collection of patient -reported outcomes.  Temporary or permanent 
discontinuation of exercise or stress management techniques is NOT a reason for subject withdrawal, since the analysis is on an intent -to-treat basis and patients are evaluable even if 
they never use any of the techniques.

 3. STUDY ENDPOINTS  
 3.1. Primary Endpoint  
 3.1.1. Functional Status 
 The Physical Component Score ( PCS) and Mental Component Score ( MCS ) of the SF -36 will be 
the primary endpoint measures of functional status.   The Acute (past week) Version of the MOS 36- Item Short Form (SF -36), a widely used self -
report measure designed to assess perceived health and functioning, contains eight scales: Physical Functioning (PF), Role -Physical (R -P); Bodily Pain (BP); General Health (GH); 
Vitality (VT); Social Functioning (SF); Mental Health (MH); and Role -Emotional (R -E).
42,[ADDRESS_819798] metric (0 -100), with higher scores being indicative of a better 
health state.  The SF -36 also yields two summary scores reflecting the underlying two-
dimensional factor structure: Physical Component Summary (PCS) scale and Mental  Component 
Summary (MCS) scale.  These summary scores are derived by [CONTACT_518058] z -score for each 
scale by [CONTACT_617319].  
Resulting scores are then transformed into T -scores (mean=5 0; standard deviation=10). Factor 
analysis has shown that the PF, R -P, and BP scales have stronger loadings on the “physical” 
component than the “mental” component, with the reverse being true for the MH, R -E, and SF 
scales.
[ADDRESS_819799] noteworthy loadings on both the physical and mental 
components.  The validity and reliability of the SF -36 has been established in a number of 
clinical populations, including cancer patients43 The SF -36 has been used in several BMT CTN 
trials including BMT CTN  0102 (Auto/Auto vs. Auto/Allo HCT for Multiple Myeloma) and 
BMT CTN  0202 (Autologous vs. Allogeneic HCT for follicular lymphoma). 
 3.2. Secondary Endpoints  
 3.2.1. Symptoms 
 The SF-36 provides measures of pain  and fatigue .  Two questions using a similar format as the 
SF-36 will be added to measure nausea.  Cancer and treatment distress will be measured by [CONTACT_617320] (CTXD) scale, a [ADDRESS_819800] studies.

validity o f the PSQI has been demonstrated in a variety of clinical populations, including cancer 
patients.45,47   
 
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK   Exercise and Stress Reduction – Protocol [ADDRESS_819802] 100 days.    3.2.3. Late Outcomes (6 months) 
 The SF-36, CTXD and Pi[INVESTIGATOR_617292].  3.2.4. Survival (6 months) 
 Overall survival is defined as the interval between  transplantation and death or last follow -up.  
Patients alive when the study closes or lost to follow up are censored at the date of last contact.  Both survival at [ADDRESS_819803] follow-up will be reported.  3.3. Additional Clinical F actors  
 3.3.1. Demographic, C linical and Transplant C haracteristics  
 As in our previous research,
25 we will assess the following  via chart review or self -report : age, 
race/ethnicity, marital status, education, occupation, employment status, income, co-morbid medical conditions .
48-51  In addition, we will collec t information on use of prescription and 
nonprescription medications, alcohol, tobacco.   Height and weight will be used to calculate body 
mass (wt[kg]/ht[m2]).  Standard patient and transplant factors will be collected such as disease 
type, disease stage, prior chemotherapy treatment, conditioning regimen, graft source, graft -
versus-host disease prophylaxis, transplant complications, relapse and survival.   3.3.2. Intervention C redibility  
 Intervention credibility will be assessed using self -report measures adapted from our previous 
research.
25  The use of three identical items across intervention conditions will allow for 
personnel collecting these forms to remain blinded to intervention assignment.  Participants will be asked to rate the following on 7- point scales ( 0=not at all to 6=extremely)  after meeting with 
the interventionist: anticipated eff ectiveness of the assigned intervention in improving qua lity of 
life, skill and competency of the interventionist, and perceived importance of making the 
assigned intervention available to other patients.  These data will be used to confirm the equivalence of the three intervention conditions with regard to credibility.  3.3.3. Exercise A ctivity  
 Exercise activity will be assessed using the Leisure Score Index (LSI) of the Godin Leisure- Time 
Exercise Questionnaire
52 and a  one item  version of the Stages of Change Form for Exercise 
(SOC -E).53  The LSI consists of 18 questions that assess the average frequency of mild, 
moderate, and strenuous exercise in a typi[INVESTIGATOR_3711].  As in our current research, the LSI will be modified to include assessment of average duration of exercise and perceived exertion.
54  We 
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK   Exercise and Stress Reduction – Protocol [ADDRESS_819804] scores and correlations with objective activity monitors and objective fitness indices.55  
The LSI will be collected at baseline, 30 days, 60 days, 100 days and 6 months.  The SOC -E 
consists of a 5- choice response format that can be used to classify respondents’ stages of change 
for adoption of regular exercise (i.e., precontemplation, contemplation, preparation, action, or 
maintenance).  The typi[INVESTIGATOR_2855] 6- month anchoring has been modified to three months for the current 
study to reflect the interval between assessments.  Information  will be used to confirm expected 
differences in exercise between participants randomized to the different groups.  In addition, 
these data will be used to explore “dose -response” relationships between amount of exercise and 
magnitude of changes in quality of life outcomes.  3.3.4. Stress Reduction A ctivity  
 Stress reduction  activity will be assessed in all participants using the 5- item Stress Reduction 
Checklist (SRC).
25  The methods assessed are those that comprise the Stress Management 
intervention.  Each method is listed by [CONTACT_617321].  Thus, participants can complete it regardless  of whether they 
received instruction in stress management.  All assessments (baseline, 30 days, 60 days, 100 days, and 6 months) will be keyed to the past week.  In previous research, we found that SRC 
scores documented expected differences in use of stress management techniques between subjects who did and did not receive instruction in stress management.
25  SRC data will be used 
to confirm expected differences in use of stress management techniques between participants randomized to different groups and explore possible differences in use of stress management 
techniques between participants  randomized to Stress Management along versus Combined 
Exercise and Stress Management .

SM (Electronic Data Capture, an Internet -based data entry 
system) and patients will be registered through AdvantageEDC.   4.2. Study Registration and Randomization 
 Once the s ubject is deemed eligible, has given written informed consent, completed the baseline 
assessment, and the transplant center has confirmed patient eligibility and necessary stratification variables, randomization occurs.  A subject may be randomized on to one of four 
arms: exercise, stress management, combined exercise and stress management, or standard care.  If a patient consents but discontinues trial participation prior to randomization, they will be replaced.   
 4.3. Training and R einforcement in I ntervention  Use 
 Once a patient is randomized, the intervention must be delivered before the day of graft infusion (Day 0).  Thus, subjects will meet with the interventionist for [ADDRESS_819806] the patient within seven days of  graft infusion (Day 0 +/ - 7 days) to reinforce use 
of the intervention.  In addition, the int erventionist will meet with patient s from all four groups at

4.4.1. Endpoint A ssessment  
 Patient self -reported information relevant to endpoint assessment will be collected at baseline 
(before randomization), at 100 days +/ - 14 days, and at six months  +/- one month.  Patients may 
complete these assessments on paper forms or by [CONTACT_617322].  The optimal method of self -reported data collection is via self -administered paper 
surveys.  Study staff will carefully review all self -completed paper forms for ambiguous 
responses and missing data , and clarify these with the participant . Reasons for inability to 
complete the assessments will be recorded.  If a patient is not able to complete self -administered 
instruments or prefers interviewer -administered assessments, data will be collected via this 
mechanism, either in person or over the phone.  The method of data collection will be recorded.    4.4.2. Use of Intervention

4-3 4.5.1. Case Report For ms 
 
A description of the forms, the procedures required for forms completion and timeliness of submission can be found in the Data Management Handbook and User’s Guide. Forms that are not received within the specified time are considered delinquent.  Trans plant centers can view 
submitted past due, and expected forms via AdvantageEDC.  A missing form  will continue to be 
requested either until the form is reported, or until an exception is granted.  4.5.2. Reporting Patient Deaths 
 Death of subject information must be reported to the BMT CTN Data Coordinating Center (DCC) within one business day of the event notification to the transplant center.  If the cause of death is unknown, it need not be recorded at the time of the initial reporting.  However, once the cause of death is known, the form must be updated.   4.5.3. Reporting Serious Adverse Events 
 [IP_ADDRESS]. Patient SAEs  
 Reporting of patient serious adverse events (SAE) will be consistent with standard BMT CTN procedures but be limited to events which are possibly, probably or de finitely associated with 
participation in this study since this protocol does not involve any pharmacologic treatment or invasive procedures.  Unexpected, grades 3 -5 adverse events (AEs) will be reported through an 
expedited AE reporting system via the web- based electronic data capture system, 
AdvantageEDC. Unexpected, grades 4- [ADDRESS_819811] be reported within three business days of knowledge of the event.  Other SAEs will be tracked per iodically as defined in the Form Submission Schedule, staged 
according to NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version 4.0.  The Data and Safety Monitoring Board will receive summary reports of all adverse experiences on at least an an nual basis. Please see section 2.[ADDRESS_819812] register and provide transplant outcome data on all consecutive hematopoietic stem cell tr ansplants done at their institution during their time of 
BMT CTN participation to the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR).  Registration is done using procedure and forms developed by [CONTACT_617324] O utcomes Database (SCTOD).  (Note: Federal legislation requires 
submission of these forms for all US allogenic transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].)   Patients enrolled in this trial will remain on pre selected form submission track (Transplant Essential Data track also known as “TED” track or Comprehensive Report From track also known as “CRF” track) that was originally assigned by [CONTACT_617325].  CIBMTR forms 
will be submitted directly to the CIBMTR at the times specified on the Form Submission Schedule.

4.6. Quality  Control 
 Because of this protocol relies on patient -reported outcomes for the primary analyses, collection 
of these data are critical.  We anticipate up to a 15% inability to collect Day 100 data from surviving patients based on logistic problems and pati ent refusal.  However, center compliance 
will be monitored every three months.  If a center falls below 75% for its cumulative compliance 
with Day [ADDRESS_819813] training and be certified by a protocol team member before the center can begin enrollment on the trial, similar to other studies in which a center personnel needs to demonstrate competence in

 5. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 5.1. Study Design  
 The protocol is designed as a factorial trial with two interventions, exercise and stress management, which results in four treatment arms: standard care, exercise only,  stress 
management only and the combination of exercise and stress management. The primary objective of this randomized phase III trial is to test the ability of exercise training or stress management training to improve physical and mental functioning at Day 100.   5.1.1. Accrual  
 It is estimated that three years of accrual will be necessary to enroll the targeted sample size of 
700 patients, based on a survey sent to centers.  Both Core and Affiliate  Centers will enroll 
patients on this study.  Accrual will be reported by [CONTACT_545], ethnicity, and sex.   5.1.2. Randomization 
 All patients will be randomized in a 1:1:1:1 ratio using random block sizes for the four arms.  Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_617326] (autologous/syngene ic, myeloablative allogeneic, or reduced intensity/non- myeloablative 
allogeneic) .  
 5.1.3. Primary Endpoint 
 The co -primary endpoints are physical functioning and mental functioning at Day [ADDRESS_819814] of an intervention (exercise or stress management) on an out come (PCS or MCS) will be determined by [CONTACT_617327]. treatment groups.  For example, the effect of exercise on physical functioning will be determined by [CONTACT_617328], one comprised of standard care and stress management only arms vs. the other comprised of exercise only and combination arms. These comparisons will be done using the Mann- Whitney test.  
Detailed analysis plan including imputation of incomplete data is given in Section 5.5.

5-2 5.2. Sample Size and Power Calculations  
 
5.2.1. Power Calculation for P rimary Intention -to-Treat Analysis 
 The primary objective of this study is to de termine if training patients to practice exercise or 
stress management during transplantation improves the patient’s experience, as measured by [CONTACT_617329].  Because of the co -primary endpoints, the allowable Type I 
error rate α = 0.05 is divided in half  so that the significance level to be used is 0.05/ 2 = 0.[ADDRESS_819815], it is assumed that the functional status  scores (MCS or PCS) are normally 
distributed and the detectable difference between two groups is δ  SD; values of δ at 0.[ADDRESS_819816] a δ SD 
difference using the ITT analysis with the target sample size of 700 patients is given in Table 5.2 for various plausible rates for Day 100 mortality and missing data among survivors.  In 
particular, assuming Day 100 mortality rate of 15% in both groups and incomplete assessment in 15% of the surviving patients, the target sample size of [ADDRESS_819817] 85% power  to 
detect a 0.5 SD difference in functional status  scores between groups.  Other plausible rates for 
mortality  and missing data are also included.

BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK   Exercise and Stress Reduction – Protocol [ADDRESS_819818] of exercise or stress reduction on mental and physical functioning in survivors who completed Day 100 assessments will be determined in a series of secondary analyses.  The power calculations for these secondary analyses are based on the same assumptions as in 5.2.1, namely 15% mortality by [CONTACT_4475] 100 and 15% missing data among survivors at the 100 day follow -up visit.  
PCS and MCS scores will be compared between exercise vs. no exercise groups and stress management vs. no stress management groups by [CONTACT_617330].  Because of the co -primary endpoints, the allowable Type I error rate is divided in half.  
A sample size of 700 gives 87% power to detect an effect size of 0.[ADDRESS_819819] for multiple comparison, the Type I error rate is divided in six.  The Type I error rate is 
further divided in half due to the co- primary endpoints so that the significance level to be used is 
0.05/12=0.0042.  A sample size of 700 gives 86% power to detect an effect size of 0.[ADDRESS_819820], because of the short anticipated accrual period (3 years) and primary endpoints assessment at [ADDRESS_819821], the use of co- primary endpoints would require that both 
be found significant at an interim analysis in order to stop; otherwise the power to detect differences in the other endpoint would be impacted.  This makes it less likely that an int erim 
analysis would result in a closure of an arm.  Finally, stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_617293], which is an important secondary analysis.    5.3.2. Interim Analysis for Futility  
 No interim analysis for futility will be performed.  All intervention arms are considered minimal 
risk to participants.  Droppi[INVESTIGATOR_617294], which are also of considerable interest.  Finally, droppi[INVESTIGATOR_617295] – Protocol [ADDRESS_819822] of the combination arm.  For all these reasons, no int erim analysis for futility 
will be performed.  5.4. Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
 Demographic and baseline characteristics will be summarized for all patients.  Characteristics to 
be examined are: patient characteristics (age, sex, race/ethnicity, performance status, disease and disease risk, CMV status, and psychosocial and functional factors); donor characteristics (donor type, HLA -match, age, sex, CMV status); graft characteristics (type, CD34+ or total nucleated 
count per kg); and transplant characteristics (type, conditioning, GVHD prophylaxis).  Between groups comparisons will be performed for continuous variables via a Kruskal -Wallis test and for 
categorical variables, via the chi -square test.  
 Before conducting the secondary analyses described below, the distributional properties of study 
variables will be examined to determine if variance stabilizing or normalizing transformations should be applied.  P articipants who complete the study and are alive at Day [ADDRESS_819823] with a two -sided significance level of 0. 025. 
 5.5.2. Analysis of Secondary Endpoints 
1. Conditional analysis of functional status in survivors with Day 100 assessments:  This 
analysis is limited to the population  of survivors who provide Day [ADDRESS_819824] of exercise training will be estimated by [CONTACT_617331] – Protocol [ADDRESS_819825] of each intervention 
will be analyzed on both mental and functional outcomes.  MCS and PCS scores will be compared at a two -sided significance level of 0.025. 
2.  Pair -wise conditional analysis of functional status in survivors with Day 100 
assessments:  This analysis is limited to the population of survivors who provide Day [ADDRESS_819826] is lower than what would be expected from combining the two interventions.
  
3. Overall survival: This analysis will include all randomized subjects.  The event is death from any cause.  The time to this event is the time from randomization to death, loss to follow- up or the end of study, whichever come s first.  Patients alive at the time of last 
follow- up are considered censored.  Survival curves will be estimated separately for each 
treatment groups using the Kaplan Meier product limit estimator.  Overall survival will be compared between groups using a log -rank test.  
4. Assessment of m issing dat a: Graphical presentations and logistic regression analysis will 
be performed to understand the missing data mechanism as well as to identify factors associated with incomplete data for survivors.  Plots of change in functional status  scores 
from baseline to 100 days and 6 months stratified by [CONTACT_617332]- out will be generated 
separately for each group to determine pattern of missingness.  Logistic regression will be used to identify baseline and clinical character istics associated with missing data.  All 
demographics and baseline characteristics listed in Section 5.4 along with the single item SF-1 general health information collected at Day 30 and 60 and the baseline functional 
scores measured at enrollment will b e included in the logistic model. 
5. Functional status scores with multiple imputation:  In this analysis, incomplete data for 
surviving patients will be replaced by [CONTACT_617333], the SF -[ADDRESS_819827] on all patients in an ITT analysis (where 
patients who die are scored at the bottom), or using linear mixed models including only patients who are alive at Day  100.  
6. Symptoms:  Domain and summary scores will be calculated for each instrument  
accord ing to the recommendations of the developers .  These will be compared between 
groups using the Kruskal -Wallis test, adjusting for baseline scores  for patients survive to 
Day 100.

The study coordinator at each center will provide the patient with information about the purpose of the study and obtain consent.  The Network will provide a template of the consent form to each center.  Each center will customize the template according to their local requirements and submit it for review by [CONTACT_110896] (IRB).  The DCC will verify the adequacy of the consent forms.  Each center must provide evidence of IRB approval.    Confidentiality : Confidentiality will be maintained by [CONTACT_617334] a patient identifier code.  The code relaying the patient’s identity with the ID code will be kept separately at the center.  The ID code will be transmitted to the network.     Participation of women, children, minorities and other populations : Women and ethnic 
minorities will be included in this study.   Children will not be included. 
 Accrual will be monitored within each center with the expectation that the enrolled patient population is representative of the transplanted patient population at each center.  Representation will be examined by [CONTACT_110898], race, ethnicity and age distributions.  Accrual of minority patients will be expected to be in proportion to the number of minority patients transplanted at each center.  The DCC and NHLBI will discuss enrollment anomalies with the centers.

This research study is sponsored by [CONTACT_60625] (NIH), the National Heart, 
Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), and the National Cancer Institute (NCI) through the Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network (BMT CTN).  
Previous studies suggest that patients who exercise or use stress management methods after 
transplant may experience better physical and emotional health than patients who do not exercise or use stress management techniques after transplant.  Although previous studies suggest benefits, we don't know if you will get any benefits by [CONTACT_96428].  That is why we are doing this research study.  What we learn may help to improve the quality of life of other patients after transplant.  
 
2. Purpose  
The main goal of this study is to learn whether patients who participate in an exercise program, 
stress management  program, or a combination of an exercise and stress management program 
will feel better after transplant compared to patients who do not participate in either progr am.  
We also want to know what parts of your physical and emotional health improve after transplant 
and how long any improvement lasts.   
 
3. The Right to Ask Questions and/or Leave the Study  
You have the right to ask questions about the study at any time.  If you have questions about your rights as a participant or you want to leave the study, please contact:

Physical and emotional care choices may include:  
 Meeting with a nurse or social worker.  
 Attending patient support groups to help you with the stress and side effects of your treatment.  
Please talk with your doctor about other options.  Every treatment option has benefits and risks. Your study doctor will discuss these options with you.  If you decide not to participate in this research study, your medical care will not be affected in any way.  
 
6. Risks and Discomforts  
Small but possible risks for this current study are primarily related to exercise .  The chances that 
these things might happen to you are considered to be small because you will be screened for any existing health conditions (for example, heart or lung disease) as part of your evaluation prior to transplantation that would make it unsafe for you to exercise.

Information & Informed Consent Form - Exercise & St ress Management  Initials   
 
B-8 Possible risks from exercise include:  
 Shortness of breath (dyspnea) 
 Muscle or joint sprains (musculoskeletal injury) 
 Foot pain or blisters 
 Heat -related injury (dehydration) that might result from exercise training  
Muscle tensing as part of active relaxation and deep breathing for stress management may feel 
uncomfortable to some people.  You  should not practice any stress management methods that 
feel painful or uncomfortable.   
If you do decide to participate, we will take extra measures to limit the chances of you getting 
hurt.  These measures include exercise plans that are a good fit for y our physical condition and 
suggesting ways to prevent possible muscle strain and soreness as well as dehydration.  
If you have any of the problems due to exercising or using the stress management methods that 
we have described, tell the person in charge of  this study or study staff at your next visit.  If these 
problems bother or worry you or if you have other problems, call the person in charge of this study at [telephone number]  
New risks might appear at any time during the study that are different from t he risks listed in this 
Consent Form.  We will promptly tell you of any new information that might affect your decision to participate.  
 
7. Possible Benefits  
Taking part in this study may or may not make your health better.   
Earlier studies suggest that patients who exercise or use stress management methods after 
transplant may experience better physical and mental well -being than patients who do not 
exercise or use stress management methods after transplant.  Although earlier studies suggest benefits, we don't know if you will get any benefits by [CONTACT_96428].  That is why we are doing this research study.  What we learn may help to improve the quality of life of other patients after transplant.  
 
8. New Information Available During the Study  
During this research study, new information about exercise or stress management methods or the 
risks and benefits of the study may become known to the study doctors.  If this happens, they will tell you about the new information.  The new information may mean that you can no longer 
participate in the study, or that you may not want to continue in the study.   
If this happens, the study doctor will stop your participation in the study and you will be offered all available care to suit your needs and medical conditi on.

Version 3.0 11 19 February 2021 1. PROTOCOL SUMMARY 
1.1. Synopsis 
Protocol Title:  An Exploratory Phase 2a Study Evaluating the Efficacy and Safety of URO-902 
in Subjects with Overactive Bladder and Urge Urinary Incontinence 
Protocol Number: URO-902-2001 Brief Title:  URO-902 in Female Subjects with Overactive Bladder and Urge Urinary 
Incontinence Study Rationale: There is a significant unmet need for treatment of overactive bladder (OAB) 
with agents with novel mechanisms of action and a we ll-tolerated safety profile, in particular, for 
patients who have been inadequately managed by [CONTACT_165539]. URO-902 
(pVAX/ hSlo) is a GMP manufactured double-strande d deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) plasmid 
(pVAX vector) containing a cDNA insert encoding the pore- forming α subunit of the human 
smooth muscle Maxi-K channel, hSlo. The Maxi-K channel is a prominent and well-studied 
potassium (K) channel subtype involved in smooth muscle relaxation. Because heightened 
smooth muscle tone may be a causative fact or of OAB with detrus or overactivity (DO), 
increased numbers of Maxi-K channels in bladde r smooth muscle cells associated with effective 
URO-902 treatment may improve this condition. Ba sed on the well tolerated favorable safety 
profile demonstrated in the completed studies in subjects with OAB and erectile dysfunction (ED) and the preliminary signals of efficacy in  the treatment of OAB observed in Study ION-03, 
the current exploratory study is designed to evalua te the efficacy and safety of a single treatment 
of URO-902 administered via intradetrusor inje ction in female subjects with OAB and urge 
urinary incontinence (UUI). 
Objectives and Endpoints:  
The study objectives are as follows: 
x To evaluate the efficacy of a single dose of URO-902 24 mg and 48 mg (administered via 
intradetrusor injection), compared with plac ebo, in subjects with OAB and UUI up to 
[ADDRESS_191852]-dose 
x To evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single dose of URO-902 24 mg and 48 mg 
(administered via intradetrusor injection), co mpared with placebo, in subjects with OAB 
and UUI up to [ADDRESS_191853]-dose 
This exploratory study has no formal statistical primary endpoint hypothesis. Study endpoints are 
as follows:

Version 3.0 13 19 February 2021 Other Endpoints 
Other endpoints include hSlo cDNA concentrations (blood and urine)  
Overall Study Design:  
Structure : Multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-treatment, 2-cohort, 
dose-escalation Study Treatment Groups : URO-902 (24 mg or 48 mg) administered as intradetrusor injections 
via cystoscopy. See Section 6.[ADDRESS_191854] (DSMB) will make recommendations regarding dose escalation only after 
unblinded review of safety data from all subjects in Cohort 1 up to Week 6 (including subjects 
who prematurely exited the study prior to Week 6). Randomization into Cohort 2 will begin only 
after the DSMB has recommende d it is safe to proceed. 
x Cohort 1: URO-902 24 mg  
x Cohort 2: URO-902 48 mg  
Controls: Matching placebo (phosphate buffered saline with 20% sucrose [PBS-20%]) in Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 (see Section 1.2 ).
 
Dosage/Dose Regimen : For each subject in Cohort 1 or Cohort 2, a single treatment will be 
administered on Day 1 after fulfillment of the “day of treatment criteria”  (see Section 6.2 ). 
Randomization/Stratification : An estimated total of 78 subjects will receive treatment across 
2 cohorts ( Section 1.2 ), with approximately 39 subjects randomized into each cohort. In both 
cohorts, subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either URO-902 (24 mg or 48 mg) or placebo. Each cohort will be randomized se parately, and enrollment will be sequential, 
starting with Cohort 1 (URO-902 24 mg [n = 26] and placebo [n = 13]) and followed by [CONTACT_133075] 2 (URO-902 48 mg [n = 26] and placebo [n = 13]). At the Randomization Visit (Visit 2), subjects 
in both Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 will be randomized ce ntrally to receive eith er a single treatment of 
URO-902 or matching placebo. In Cohort 1a, random ization will be stratified by [CONTACT_165541][INVESTIGATOR_914] (ie, ≤ 3 vs. > 3 UUI epi[INVESTIGATOR_914]) and the presence or absence of DO (as 
determined by [CONTACT_093]). In Cohort 1b and Cohort 2, randomization will be stratified by 
[CONTACT_165542][INVESTIGATOR_165504] e of onabotulinumtoxinA (naïve vs. prior use). 
Enrollment for subjects with previous onabotulinum toxinA use will be capped at 50% of the total 
subject population per cohort.  
Visit Schedule : Study visits will be identical for Cohorts 1 and 2. A 5-week screening and 
randomization period (Days -35 to -1) will include screening subjects for eligibility (Visit 1) and 
randomization of eligible subjects (Visit 2). Subjects  will be administered the study treatment via 
cystoscopy on Day 1 (Visit 3). All subjects will be  evaluated at scheduled post-treatment visits at 
Urovant Sciences Confidential  Protocol URO-902-2001 
Version 3.0 14 19 February 2021 Weeks 2, 6, 12, 18, and 24 (Visits 4 to 8, respectively), or until the subject exits the study. 
Afterwards, for subjects who complete the Week  24 Visit (Visit 8), 2 follow-up telephone (or 
other virtual technology) visits will be performed  at Week 36 (Visit 9) and Week 48 (Visit 10). 
Additional OAB treatment : Starting at Week 24 (Visit 8), subjects can request and receive 
additional OAB treatment(s) at the clinical disc retion of the investigator. Subjects who receive 
additional OAB treatment(s) at Week 24 or after will only be followed to assess adverse events 
at any future telephone (or other virtual tec hnology) visits (Week 36 and/or Week 48). No 
efficacy assessments will be performed once a subject receives additional OAB treatment (see 
Section 6.9.2). 
Safety and efficacy assessments and study procedures are outlined in the study schema 
(Section 1.2) and the Schedule of Assessments ( Section 1.3 ).

with an intervention (such as catheterizati on), within 6 months of the Screening Visit 
(Visit 1). Note: transient voiding difficulties  as a result of surgical procedures that 
resolved within [ADDRESS_191862] infections (UTIs) within 6 months of the 
Screening Visit (Visit 1) or is taking prophyl actic antibiotics to prevent chronic UTIs. 
Subjects with a current acute UTI during scre ening can be treated appropriately and are 
eligible.  
x Subject has current or previous uninvestigated hematuria. Subjects with investigated 
hematuria may enter the study if urological/renal pathology has been ruled out to the satisfaction of the investigator. 
Number of Subjects: Approximately 78 adult female subjects will be randomized into the 
2 cohorts, with approximately 39 subjects randomized into each cohort.  
Approximate Number of Sites: Up to 25 sites in North America   
Study Drug Groups and Study Duration:  
Refer to section on Overall Study Design above for treatment group information. 
Duration: Up to 53 weeks (5-week screening a nd randomization period, treatment administration 
on Day 1, and 48-week double-blind post-treatment/follow-up period) 
Statistical Methods:  
The following analysis populations will be evalua ted: safety, safety (modified), and intent-to-
treat exposed (ITT-E). The safety population w ill consist of all subjects who received the study 
drug and will be used to assess treatment-emergent adverse events and other safety evaluations 
based on actual treatment received. A separate safety population, safety (modified), will be created to assess safety excluding subjects who received additional OAB medication at Week [ADDRESS_191863] of all subjects randomized and treated from Cohorts 1 and 2. 
Interim analyses may be conducted when ≥ 50% of subjects in Cohort 1 and/or when ≥ 50% of 
subjects in Cohort [ADDRESS_191864]-randomization (or prematurely exited the study prior to Week 12) for future planning purposes. A planned interim 
analysis will be performed to evaluate th e objectives of the protocol at Week 12, after all 
subjects in Cohorts [ADDRESS_191865] completed the W eek 12 Visit/Visit 6 (or prematurely exited the 
study prior to Week 12). The final analysis will be performed after all subjects have completed the study or exit the study prematurely. Details of the interim analyses and final analysis will be 
described in the Statistical Analysis Plan. The study has no formal statistical primary endpoint hypothesis. Descriptive statistics will be used to evaluate the efficacy and safety endpoints. For continuous efficacy endpoints, estimates 
of least squares means, standard er ror, and 95% confidence intervals (CI) will be presented for 
each treatment group. Nominal p-values from co mparisons to placebo may be provided for 
descriptive purposes. 
The point estimate of the treatment difference an d 95% confidence interval  for the change from 
baseline at each visit for each continuous efficacy variable relative to placebo will be analyzed using a mixed-effect model for repeated measur es (MMRM) method. The analysis model will 
include terms for baseline value as a covariate, in addition to the terms for treatment, visit, and treatment by [CONTACT_23259]. For the urodynami c variables evaluated, only the independent 
central reviewer’s interpr etation will be analyzed. 
Urovant Sciences Confidential  Protocol URO-902-2001 
Version 3.0 17 19 February 2021 The proportion of subjects who achieve ≥ 50% reduction from baseline UUI epi[INVESTIGATOR_165509] 12 will be calculated for each treatment group . In addition, responder analyses will also be 
calculated for subjects who achieve ≥ 75% and 100% decrease in epi[INVESTIGATOR_165510] 12 
relative to baseline. The Cochran-Mantel-Haensze l (CMH) method will be utilized to compare 
the proportion of responders between the acti ve and placebo groups by [CONTACT_165545]. Data for all visits will also be presented. 
For safety variables, data from all subjects in the 2 cohorts who received study drug will be included. The incidence of adverse events will be summarized. The change from baseline in PVR 
urine volume will be analyzed. Sample Size Estimation: For this exploratory st udy, the sample size was empi[INVESTIGATOR_22580]. 
Please see Section 9.[ADDRESS_191866] (DSMB) : A DSMB will be retained to assess, on an 
ongoing basis, all safety aspects of this study including unblinded review of safety data after all subjects reach Week 6 (or prematurely exited the study prior to Week 6) in Cohort 1 (URO-902 24 mg). Randomization into Cohort 2 will begin only after the DSMB has recommended it is safe to proceed to Cohort 2. Th is committee will be an external independent 
DSMB that monitors safety. The detailed activities including meeting plans will be described and documented in a separate DSMB Charter. A separa te statistical analysis plan may also be 
prepared for the DSMB.

Note: 
1) Dose escalation to Cohort [ADDRESS_191867] (DSMB) after all subjects reach Week 6 (or pr ematurely exited the study prior to Week 6) in 
Cohort 1. Randomization into Cohort 2 will begin only af ter the DSMB has recommended it is safe to 
proceed. 
2) Starting at Week 24, subjects can request and receive additional overac tive bladder (OAB) treatment(s) at 
the clinical discretion of the investigato r. Subjects who receive additional OAB treatment(s) at Week 24 or 
after will only be followed to assess adverse events  at any future telephone (or other virtual technology) 
visits (Week 36 and/or Week 48). No efficacy assess ments will be performed once a subject receives
additional OAB treatment (see Section 6.9.2 ).

Version 3.0 22 19 February 2021 2. INTRODUCTION 
Urovant Sciences GmbH (Urovant) is developi[INVESTIGATOR_165511]-902 (formerly known as hMaxi-K or 
pVAX/ hSlo) for the treatment of overactive bladder (O AB) and urge urinary incontinence (UUI) 
in adults who have been inadequately managed by [CONTACT_165539]. 
2.1. Background 
Overactive Bladder 
OAB is highly prevalent and affects approximately 16% of the population in the [LOCATION_002] 
and Europe. Prevalence increases with age, affecting approximately a third of people 75 years 
and older [Stewart, 2003 ; Milsom, 2001 ]. The International Continence Society (ICS) defines 
OAB as urgency, with or without urge incontin ence, usually associate d with frequency and 
nocturia [ Abrams, 2002 ]. Urgency is defined as a sudden compelling desire to void which is 
difficult to defer and, from the medical definition perspective, it is a necessary symptom for 
OAB. Urgency incontinence is th e involuntary loss of urine accompanied by [CONTACT_165547] (referred to 
as OAB Wet) and is present in approxima tely one-third of patients with OAB [ Stewart, 2003 ; 
Milsom, 2001 ]. In the absence of incontinence, OAB is referred to as OAB Dry. OAB has been 
shown to negatively impact both social and med ical well-being and represents a significant 
burden in terms of annual direct and indirect healthcare expenditures [ Kelleher, 2002; 
Abrams, 2000 ; Reynolds, 2016 ]. 
Currently, the predominant class of drugs used to treat OAB is antimuscarinics. The clinical utility of antimuscarinics is limited by [CONTACT_2030] m odest efficacy and poor tolerability due to 
mechanism-based side effects including dry mouth and constipation. In addition to poor tolerability and modest efficacy, a recen t body of literature suggests that chronic use of 
anticholinergics is associated with cognitive impairment and dementia [ Risacher, 2016 ; 
Gray, 2015 ]. Mirabegron (Myrbetriq
®; Astellas Pharma US, Inc), a β3-agonist and smooth 
muscle relaxer, is currently approved in mu ltiple countries for the treatment of OAB 
[Nitti, 2013]. The reported adverse effects with mirabe gron were similar to antimuscarinics, but 
with a lower incidence of dry mouth compared with tolterodine, an antimuscarinic. However, the effects of mirabegron on the cardiovascular syst em, pharmacokinetic interactions with other 
drugs, and increased incidence of new malignant ev ents will require careful evaluation in the 
near future [ Sacco, 2012 ]. In addition, BOTOX
® (onabotulinumtoxinA), a neurotoxin which 
inhibits muscle contraction by [CONTACT_165548], has been approved for th e treatment of neurogenic and idiopathic OAB 
(since 2011and 2012, respectively). BOTOX is administered via multiple intradetrusor injections into the bladder wall about every [ADDRESS_191873] 
infections (UTIs), dysuria, and urinary retenti on. Other side effects are consistent with the 
mechanism of action of botulinum toxin and may include asthenia, generalized muscle weakness, 
diplopia, ptosis, dysphagia, dysphonia, dysarthria, urinary incontinence, and breathing 
Urovant Sciences Confidential Protocol URO-902-[ADDRESS_191874] been reported hours to weeks after injection 
[BOTOX Package Insert, 2018 ]. 
A major problem with currently available OAB treatments is that even when these drugs have documented efficacy, treatment is still limited by [CONTACT_165549]. There is a significant unmet 
need for the treatment of OAB with agents wi th novel mechanisms of action and a well-tolerated 
safety profile. 
URO-[ADDRESS_191875] 
been inadequately managed by [CONTACT_165539]. URO-902 (pVAX/ hSlo) is a GMP 
manufactured double-stranded DNA plasmid (pVAX vector) containing a cDNA insert encoding the pore- forming α subunit of the human smooth muscle Maxi -K channel, hSlo. The Maxi-K 
channel is a prominent and well-studied K channel subtype involved in smooth muscle 
relaxation. Because heightened smooth muscle tone  may be a causative factor of OAB with DO, 
increased numbers of Maxi-K channels in th e bladder smooth muscle cells associated with 
effective URO-902 treatment may improve this c ondition. Based on the favorable safety profile 
demonstrated in the completed clinical studies in subjects with OAB  
 
 the current exploratory study is designed to 
evaluate the efficacy and safety of a single tr eatment of URO-902 administered via intradetrusor 
injection in subjects with OAB and UUI. 
2.3. Benefit/Risk Assessment 
2.3.1. Potential Benefits 
URO- 902’s  mechanism of action has the potential to d emonstrate significant therapeutic benefit 
in the treatment of OAB and UUI. Noncli nical studies conducted with URO-[ADDRESS_191876] 
demonstrated no toxicity and no off-target effects in safety pharmacology studies. URO-902 has demonstrated a favorable safety profile in completed clinical studies  
 
 
 
 
 

Urovant Sciences Confidential Protocol URO-902-2001 
Version 3.0 26 19 February 2021 2.3.2. Potential Risks 
Nonclinical studies evaluating URO-902 support the safety of the doses being evaluated in this 
study. Data from URO-902 nonclinical studies are summarized in the IB. See Section 4.3 for 
justification of dose selection. 
URO-902 at doses of up to 24 mg (which is the starting dose being evaluated in the current 
study) administered by [CONTACT_165550]/detrusor muscle has been evaluated 
in a previous clinical study ION-03. No clinical safety signals (including no urinary retention), were identified in the studies. More detailed information about the known and reasonably expected adverse events of URO-[ADDRESS_191877] (DSMB). The study follows a dose-escalation design. The DSMB will make recommendations regarding dose escalation only after  unblinded review of safety data from all 
subjects in Cohort 1 up to Week 6. 
URO-902 is an investigational drug and should only be used as specified in the clinical study 
protocol. Subjects should be excluded from treatment with URO-902 in accordance with inclusion/exclusion criteria of the protocol.

Urovant Sciences Confidential Protocol URO-902-2001 
Version 3.0 29 19 February 2021 4. STUDY DESIGN 
4.1. Overall Design 
This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-treatment, 2 cohort, 
dose-escalation study evaluating the efficacy and safety of URO-902 (24 mg or 48 mg) in the 
treatment of OAB and UUI in female subjects ag ed [ADDRESS_191880] meet all eligibility requirements to qualify for enrollment and randomization. 
Safety and efficacy assessments and study procedures are outlined in the study schema 
(Section 1.2) and the Schedule of Assessments ( Section 1.3 ). 
The total duration of the study is up to 53 weeks including a 5-week screening and 
randomization period (Days -35 to -1); trea tment on Day 1, and a 48-week double-blind 
post-treatment/follow-up period. Study visits will be identical for Cohorts 1 and 2. Subjects will be evaluated at the Screening Visit (Visit 1) for eligibility. Eligible subjects will be randomized to treatment within each cohort at the Randomization Visit (Visit 2); however, subjects will be administered study treatment via cystoscopy on Day 1 (Visit 3). All subjects will be evaluated at scheduled post-treatment visits at Weeks 2, 6, 12, 18 (phone/virtual), and 24 (Visits 4 to 8, 
respectively), or until the subject exits the study. Afterwards, for subjects who have completed 
the Week 24 Visit (Visit 8), 2 follow-up telephone visits (or other virtual technology visits) for assessment of safety will be performed at Week 36 (Visit 9) and Week 48 (Visit 10). 
An estimated total of 78 subjects will receive treatment across 2 cohorts ( Section 1.2), with 
approximately 39 subjects randomized into each cohort. In both cohorts, subjects will be 
randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either URO-902 (24 mg or 48 mg) or placebo. Each cohort will be randomized separately, and enrollment will be sequential, starting with Cohort 1 
(URO-902 24 mg [n = 26] and placebo [n = 13]) and followed by [CONTACT_133075] 2 (URO-902 48 mg [n = 26] and placebo [n = 13]). S ubjects in both Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 will be randomized 
centrally to receive eith er a single treatment of URO-902 or matching placebo.  
In Cohort 1a, randomization will be strati fied by [CONTACT_165542][INVESTIGATOR_914] (ie, ≤ 3 vs. 
> 3 UUI epi[INVESTIGATOR_914]) and presence or absen ce of DO (as determined by [CONTACT_093]) at 
Visit 2. In Cohort 1b and Cohort 2, randomization will  be stratified by [CONTACT_165542][INVESTIGATOR_165512] (na ïve vs. prior use). OnabotulinumtoxinA 
treatment for urological indications must have occ urred at least 12 months prior to starting the 
Screening Bladder Diary. Enrollment for subjects with previous onabotulinumtoxinA use will be 
capped at 50% of the total subject population per cohort. See details on stratification factors in Section 6.5 . 
In Cohort 1, an unblinded review of safety data by [CONTACT_165552] 6 (or prematurely exited the study prior to Week 6). Randomization into Cohort [ADDRESS_191881] in Cohort 1 or Cohort 2, a single treatment will be administered on Day 1 
(Visit 3) after fulfillment of the “day of treatment criteria”  (Section 6.2 ). Subjects will receive a 
single treatment of URO-[ADDRESS_191882] and receive addition al OAB treatment(s) at the clinical discretion 
of the investigator. Subjects who receive additional OAB treatment(s) at Week 24 or after will only be followed to assess adverse events at any future telephone (or other virtual technology) visits (Week 36 and/or Week 48). No efficacy as sessments will be performed once a subject 
receives additional OAB treatment. 
4.1.1. Clinical Hypothesis 
Due to the exploratory nature of this trial, there is no formal hypothesis. Statistical testing will be 
performed to estimate the treatment effect of URO-902 relative to placebo in female subjects 
with OAB with UUI. 
4.2. Scientific Rationale for Study Design 
Study URO-902-2001 is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-treatment, 
2 cohort, dose-escalation, exploratory efficacy and safety study. 
The dose-escalation design, including interim safety  analyses and DSMB review between each 
cohort, helps minimize the risk to subjects. Ra ndomization into Cohort 2 ( higher dose) will 
begin only after the DSMB has recommended it is safe to proceed. Randomization will be stratified by  [CONTACT_165542][INVESTIGATOR_914], presence or absence of DO 
(as determined by [CONTACT_093]), and previous  use of onabotulinumtoxinA (naïve vs. prior 
use) to ensure balance across the treatment groups. See details on stratification factors in 
Section 6.5. This study is in the early stages of the development program for URO-902. There are no 
nonclinical studies that have investigated the genotoxic or reproductive effects of URO-902. 
Therefore, the study only includes female subjec ts of nonchildbearing potential. The study is 
randomized and double-blind to minimize invest igator and subject bias and will provide a 
Urovant Sciences Confidential Protocol URO-902-2001 
Version 3.0 31 19 February 2021 placebo comparator for evaluating the safety and efficacy of the 2 doses of URO-902 being 
studied. In addition, relevant safety parameters including adverse events (AEs), SAEs, AEs of urinary retention and UTI as per protocol defini tion, physical examination, vital signs (pulse rate, 
blood pressure, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487], and body temperature), urine dipstick reagent strip test, urinalysis/urine culture/sensitivity, as applicable, hematology and clinical chemistry, PVR urine volume, kidney and bladder ultrasound, concomitan t medications and concurrent procedures will 
be closely monitored throughout the study.  
4.3. Justification of Dose 
An extensive series of in vitro  and in vivo  nonclinical studies evaluating the activity and safety of 
URO-[ADDRESS_191883] been conducted in OAB and ED animal models at doses up to 1 mg. The results 
of the nonclinical evaluations supported the initiation of URO-902 clinical studies. No toxicity was observed at any dose level in any of the preclinical studies at any dose in studies conducted to date, including multiple dosing in the ED rat model. Extensive data in the ED and OAB animal models has shown neither histopathol ogical abnormality at any time point in any of 
40 organs evaluated or expression of the gene in any other organ other than the organ that underwent transfer more than 1 week after that tr ansfer, as well as in ED studies conducted up to 
1 month after transfer. 
The bladder preclinical studies evaluated single doses of 0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, and 1 mg based on 
an obstructed bladder surface area of 12.56 cm
2 and an average approximate bladder volume of 
4 mL . The formula for surface area is 4 πr2. Hence, human bladder surface area (average bladder 
volume of 400 mL) is 263.5 cm2. Therefore, the approximate dose relationship of human to rat 
bladder is 20:1. In the completed OAB clinical studies, doses up to [ADDRESS_191884] injection into the bladder wall/detrusor muscle were well-t olerated. Data from completed URO-902 nonclinical 
and clinical studies are summarized in the IB. 
In the  
 
 
 No clinically meaningful safety signals were identified at either the 16 mg 
or 24 mg dose in  A starting dose of 24 mg will be initially tested in the planned 
Phase 2a clinical study URO-902-2001 to evalu ate the safety and efficacy of URO-902 in 
subjects with OAB and UUI. Study URO-902-20 01 has a dose-escalation design. Based on the 
unblinded review of observed safety data from all subjects in Cohort 1 (URO-902 24 mg) up to 
Week 6, the DSMB will make the recommendation to proceed with Cohort 2. Randomization 
into Cohort 2 (URO-902 48 mg) will begin only af ter the DSMB has recommended it is safe to 
proceed. 
The dose equivalent to the [ADDRESS_191885] dose to be evaluated in the 
planned clinical study (48 mg) are well within the range of doses investigated in the preclinical studies. 
4.4. End of Study Definition 
The end of the study is defined as the date of the last visit or last schedu led procedure shown in 
the Schedule of Assessments ( Section 1.3 ) for the last subject in the study.

pVAX/ hSlo). 
23. Subject has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, laboratory abnormality or other circumstances that might, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], confound the results of the study, interfere with the subject's ability to comply with the study procedure, or make participation in the study not in the subject's best interest. 
5.3. Lifestyle Considerations 
Not applicable for this study. 
Urovant Sciences Confidential Protocol URO-902-2001 
Version 3.0 36 19 February 2021 5.4. Screen Failures 
Screen failures are defined as subjects who consen t to participate in the clinical study but are not 
subsequently randomized to treatment. A minima l set of screen failure information is required to 
ensure transparent reporting of screen failure s ubjects to meet the Consolidated Standards of 
Reporting Trials (CONSORT) publishing requirements  and to respond to queries from regulatory 
authorities. Minimal information includes demography, screen failure details, eligibility criteria, 
and any SAE. 
Individuals who do not meet the criteria for participation in this study (screen failures) may be 
rescreened once upon consultation with, and approval by, the Sponsor or its designee. Rescreened subjects will be assigned a new s ubject number, and both subject numbers will be 
linked to the subject, and a new informed consent with the new subject number should be signed. 
Screening assessments specified in Section 1.3  should be repeated if subjects are rescreened. The 
following assessments would NOT need to be repeated if rescreening occurs within 2 to 8 weeks of the original screening date: Safety labs (if within 2 weeks); Urodynamics (if within 8 weeks). See Section 8.2.3  for information on valid historical urodynamic assessments.

Version 3.0 37 19 February 2021 6. STUDY TREATMENTS 
6.1. Study Drugs Administered 
All eligible subjects enrolled into the study will receive a single double-blind treatment of either 
URO-902 or placebo based on the cohort they are enrolled in. 
URO-902 (24 mg or 48 mg) or matching placebo will be  administered as intradetrusor injections 
via cystoscopy. For Cohort 1, a single treatment of URO-902 24 mg or placebo will be administered. Based on 
the unblinded review of observed safety data from all subjects in Cohort 1 up to Week 6 
(including subjects who prematurely exited the study prior to Week 6), the DSMB will make the 
recommendation to proceed with Cohort 2. Random ization into Cohort 2 will begin only after 
the DSMB has recommended it is safe to proceed. 
x Cohort 1: URO-902 24 mg or matching plac ebo (phosphate buffered saline with 20% 
sucrose [PBS-20%]) 
x Cohort 2: URO-902 48 mg or matching placebo (PBS-20%) 
See Table 1  for a summary on study drugs.

Study Drug Name  [CONTACT_165579]-[ADDRESS_191898]  Phosphate Buffered Saline with 
20% Sucrose (PBS-20%) 
Dosage Formulation 
Dose [ADDRESS_191899] in Cohort 1 or Cohort 2, a single treatment will be administered on Day 1 
(Visit 3) after fulfillment of the following “day of treatment criteria”:  
x Negative urine dipstick reagent strip te st (for nitrates and leukocyte esterase) 
x If evaluated, negative urinalysis/urine culture /sensitivity results for a possible UTI have 
been reviewed 
x Subject is asymptomatic for a UTI, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871] 
x No presence of bladder stones prior to or at cystoscopy 
x Investigator continues to deem that no condition or situation exists which, in the investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], puts the subject at signifi cant risk from receiving URO-[ADDRESS_191900]’s  
primary care physician (or internist, cardiologist, etc), as deemed clinically necessary by 
[CONTACT_093], if the subject can discont inue these drugs for 2-3 days prior to the 
intradetrusor injections treatment and on the day of treatment. Subjects on an 
anticoagulant and/or anti-platelet therapy must be managed appropriately to decrease the 
risk of bleeding, per the clinical judgment of the investigator. 
x All subjects must receive prophylactic anti biotics at a minimum on Day [ADDRESS_191901]-treatment.  At the investigator’s 
discretion, subjects can receive prophylactic antibi otics up to 3 days prior to treatment per 
local site practice. 
x Prior to administration of study treatment, subjects will be instructed to void their bladder and then assume a supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547]. 
x Use of anesthesia before treatment administrati on will be determined by [CONTACT_093]. 
All study procedures are to be conducted using the appropriate antiseptic technique per local site practice for a cystoscopy.  After disinfection of th e urethral meatus, the 
following options are strongly recommended: 
o Lubricating gel, with or without local anesthetic, to facilitate insertion of the sterile, single-use transurethral catheter per local site practice 
o For all subjects, local anesthesia instillation in the bladder: 
 Instillation into the bladder of 1% to  4% lidocaine (or similar acting local 
anesthetic) prior to the procedure 
 Instillation solution should remain in the bladder for at least 15 minutes to achieve sufficient anesthesia; afterwards, the bladder will be drained of lidocaine, rinsed with saline, and drained again 
x A flexible or rigid cystoscope will be used for administration of study treatment. Per local site practice lubricating gel will be used to insert the cystoscope. The bladder will be instilled with a sufficient amount of saline to  visualize the study injections. One syringe 
of appropriate size to hold a minimu m of 12 mL of study drug and one syringe of 
appropriate size to hold a minimum of 1 mL PBS-20% flushing solution will be prepared and ready for treatment administration (refer to Section 6.5  as needed). The injection 
needle will be primed with approximately 0.[ADDRESS_191902] visualization via cystoscopy, injections will be distributed evenly across the detrusor wall 
and spaced approximately 1 cm apart, a voiding the bladder dome and trigone.  
Urovant Sciences Confidential Protocol URO-902-2001 
Version 3.0 40 19 February 2021 x To administer study drug from the syringe, the needle should be inserted approximately 
2 mm into the detrusor for each injection. F or the final injection site, a sufficient amount 
of PBS-20% (from the 1-mL syringe) will be pushed through the injection needle to ensure delivery of the remaining amount of study drug. 
x After injections are administered, the saline used for visualization must not be drained 
from the bladder to allow subjects to demons trate the ability to void prior to leaving the 
clinic. Subjects must remain in the clinic until a spontaneous void has occurred, and to complete post-treatment assessments includi ng observation as well as pharmacokinetic 
sample collection. 
x Subjects will be instructed to contact [CONTACT_165553] 48 hours following administration of study treatment. 
6.4. Preparation/Handling/Storage/Accountability  
Clinical supplies must be stored in a secure, limited-access location under the storage conditions 
specified on the label. Refer to the appropriate  study manual for the storage and handling of 
URO-[ADDRESS_191903] does not fulfill the day of treatment criteria 
(Section 6.2 ), likely due to a suspected UTI that re quires antibiotic treatment, study drug (URO-
902 or placebo) can remain in the refrigerator (2° to 8°C, in the original vial) as per instructions in the study manual to enable the subject to reschedule and return for the treatment visit (Day 1). 
Receipt and dispensing of study treatment must be recorded by [CONTACT_165554]. 
Clinical supplies may not be used for any purpose other than that stated in the protocol. 
The investigator is responsible for keepi[INVESTIGATOR_165516], the amount dispensed and the amount remaining at the conclusion of 
the study. These records will be monitored throughout the study. 
For all sites, the local country Sponsor pe rsonnel or designee will provide appropriate 
documentation that must be completed for drug accountability and return. 
6.5. Measures to Minimize Bias: Randomization and Blinding 
To maintain blinding of the treatment groups, ne ither the investigator/physician subinvestigator 
(injector) nor site personnel who are involved in  evaluating or injecting the subject should 
prepare the study drug. An additional individual (eg, unblinded pharmacist or nurse) with no 
subject evaluation or treatment involvement must be identified at each investigative site to prepare the study drug and the PBS-20% flushing solution. The responsibility of this individual will be to properly prepare the injection syringe s with the accurate randomized study drug as per 
the volumes indicated by [CONTACT_1034]. They will draw the study drug into the syringes to be injected and dilute as needed as per instruct ions in the appropriate study manual. The study 
manual will be provided by [CONTACT_1034]/designee before the study start. 
Urovant Sciences Confidential Protocol URO-902-2001 
Version 3.0 41 19 February 2021 If an interim analysis(es) is/are performed ( Section 9.8.1 ), the subject and the investigator or 
delegate(s) who are involved in the treatment or clinical evaluation of the subjects will remain 
blinded to the treatment assignments. Limited personnel from the Sponsor will be unblinded (double-blind, sponsor-open design). Sponsor personne l/designees who are directly involved 
with site interactions and communications (eg, study data manager and site monitors) will remain 
blinded to subject level treatment assignment. 
In both cohorts, subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either URO-902 (24 mg or 
48 mg) or placebo. Each cohort will be randomized separately, and enrollment will be sequential, 
starting with Cohort 1 and followed by [CONTACT_133075] 2. At the Randomization Visit (Visit 2), subjects in both Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 will be randomized ce ntrally to receive eith er a single treatment of 
URO-902 or matching placebo.  
In Cohort 1a, randomization will be strati fied by [CONTACT_165542][INVESTIGATOR_914] (≤ 3 vs. > 3 UUI 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_914]) and presence or absence of DO (as determined by [CONTACT_093]) as per the 
original protocol. Subjects will be enrolle d into Cohort 1b following implementation of 
Amendment 1 and updates to the interactive we b response system (IWRS) system. In Cohort 1b 
and Cohort 2, randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_165542][INVESTIGATOR_165517] (naïve vs. prior use).  
For Cohorts 1a, 1b, and 2, stratification factor for baseline UUI epi[INVESTIGATOR_165518] 3-day diary period at baseline (ie, ≤ 3 vs. 
> 3 UU1 epi[INVESTIGATOR_914]).  
For Cohort 1a, the urodynamic assessment where an evaluation of the presence or absence of DO 
is performed to be used as a randomization factor, must be conducted at Visit 2 prior to performing the actual randomization procedure. For subjects with a valid historical urodynamic 
study (per protocol Section 8.2.3 ), the presence or absence of DO would already be known. 
For Cohorts 1b and 2, onabotulinumtoxinA trea tment for urological indications must have 
occurred at least 12 months prior to starting  the Screening Bladder Diary. Enrollment for 
subjects with previous onabotulinumtoxinA use will be capped at 50% of the total subject 
population per cohort. Subjects randomized to Cohort 1a will be assigned to the onabotulinumtoxinA naïve stratum for all analyses. 
Subjects will be centrally assigned to ra ndomized study drug using an IWRS and the 
randomization schedule generated by [CONTACT_36613]. Before screening is initiated at 
each site, login information and directions for the IWRS will be provided. 
The IWRS will be programmed with blind-breaking instructions. In case of an emergency, the 
investigator or designee has the sole responsibility for determining i f unblinding of a subject’s 
study drug assignment is warranted. Subject safety  must always be the first consideration in 
making such a determination. If the investigator decides that unblinding is warranted, the investigator should make every effort to contact [CONTACT_165555] a 
Urovant Sciences Confidential Protocol URO-902-[ADDRESS_191904]’s study drug assignment unless this could delay emergency treatment of the subject. If a 
subject’s study drug assignment is unblinded, the Sponsor or designee must be notified within [ADDRESS_191905]’s electronic case report form ( eCRF) at each visit along with the reason the medication is 
taken, the dates of administration, and the dose. 
6.9.1. Prohibited Drugs and Washout 
Section 10.[ADDRESS_191906] of medications prohibited before the study and during the study (until 
Week 24) and the associated washout periods.  If there is a clinical indication for any therapy that 
is specifically prohibited during the study, discont inuation from the study may be required. The 
investigator should discuss any questions regarding this with the Sponsor’s designated M edical 
Monitor. The final decision on any supportive therapy rests with the investigator and/or the 
subject ’s primary physician. However, the decision to continue the subject in the study requires 
the mutual agreement of the investigator and the Sponsor ’s desig nated Medical Monitor. Consult 
the Sponsor’s designated Medical Monitor if there is any uncertainty regarding subject use of a particular drug or drug class. 
Urovant Sciences Confidential Protocol URO-902-[ADDRESS_191907] and in accordance with the investigator’s 
clinical judgment. See Section 6.9.[ADDRESS_191908] during the study may be given at the discretion 
of the investigator. If the permissibility of a specific medication/drug is in question, please 
contact [CONTACT_1034]’s designated Medical Monitor. Any medication or vaccine (including over -
the-counter or prescription medicines, vitamins, and/or herbal supplements) that the subject is 
receiving at the time of enrollment, start of scre ening, or receives during the study must be 
recorded in the eCRF. 
Furthermore, starting at Week 24 and after (at clinic visit, phone [or other virtual technology] 
visits or between visits), subjects can request and receive additional OAB treatment(s) such as 
those listed in Section 10.7  (see Section 6.9.1 ) at the clinical discretion of the investigator. The 
following criteria should be followed in order for subjects to receive additional OAB 
treatment(s): 
x Subject initiates a request for additional OAB treatment 
x Ensure subject’s last available OAB symptoms are recorded, as determined by [CONTACT_165556] 3-day patient Bladder D iary (if not already recorded) 
x Investigator deems the additional OAB treatm ent is appropriate and that no condition or 
situation exists which, in the investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], put s the subject at significant risk 
from treatment. 
Subjects who receive additional OAB treatment(s) at Week 24 or after will only be followed to 
assess adverse events at any future telephone (or other virtual technology) visits (Week 36 and/or 
Week 48). No bladder diaries will be collected, an d no efficacy assessments will be performed 
once a subject receives additional OAB treatment. Additional OAB medications will not be provided by [CONTACT_1034]. 
Urovant Sciences Confidential Protocol URO-902-[ADDRESS_191909] who signs the informed consent form (ICF) 
and is randomized ceases participation in the study, regardless of circumstances, before the 
completion of the protocol-defined study procedures. 
7.1. Subject Discontinuation/Withdrawal from the Study 
x A subject may choose to withdraw from the study at any time at her own request or may be 
withdrawn at any time at the discretion of the investigator or Sponsor for safety, behavioral, 
compliance, or administrative reasons. 
x If a subject withdraws consent for disclosure of future information, the Sponsor or designee may retain and continue to use any data coll ected before such a withdrawal of consent. 
x If a subject withdraws from the study, she may request destruction of any blood or urine 
samples taken and not tested, and the investig ator must document this in the site study 
records and communicate this request to the Sponsor study team so that appropriate measures may be taken to ensure destruction of the materials. 
x Subjects who withdraw from the study will not be replaced (enrollment accounts for a 
predetermined dropout rate). 
The Week 24/Exit Clinic Visit (Visit 8) assessments  as specified in the Schedule of Assessments 
(Section 1.3) will be completed when a subject wit hdraws or is withdrawn from the study, if 
possible. 
Reasons for discontinuation from the study include the following: 
x AE 
x Lack of efficacy 
x Noncompliance 
x Withdrawal of consent 
x Lost to follow-up 
x Physician decision 
x Protocol deviation 
x Pregnancy 
x Death 
x Administrative issues (eg, site closure) 
x Other 
Urovant Sciences Confidential Protocol URO-902-[ADDRESS_191910] wishes to and/or should continue in the study based on previous non-compliance. In 
cases where the subject does not return for the rescheduled visit or cannot be reached to 
reschedule the missed visit, the site should make every effort to regain contact [CONTACT_165557] a primary reason of “Lost to Follow- up”, including at least three documented attempts  to contact [CONTACT_423] (ie, phone, email, 
or certified letter). Efforts to establish the possible reason for discontinuation should be documented. 
7.3. Early Study Termination 
The Sponsor reserves the right to terminate th e study for any reason. The study may be 
terminated early if the extent (incidence and/or se verity) of emerging effects/clinical endpoints is 
such that the risk/benefit ratio to the study population as a whole is unacceptable. In addition, further recruitment in the study overall or at a particular study site may be stopped due to insufficient compliance with the protocol, G ood Clinical Practice and/or other applicable 
regulatory requirements, procedure-related probl ems or the number of discontinuations for 
administrative reasons is too high. 
Urovant Sciences Confidential Protocol URO-902-2001 
Version 3.0 46 19 February 2021 8. STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES 
Study procedures and their scheduled  timepoints are summarized in the Schedule of Assessments 
(Section 1.3 ). Site personnel should note the following: 
x Protocol waivers or exemptions are not allowe d; however, subjects who fail to meet 
eligibility criteria may be rescreened once, as appropriate (See Section 5.4 ). Any notable 
protocol deviations should be noted and raised to the Sponsor’s or designee’s attention.  
x Immediate safety concerns should be discussed with the Sponsor’s designated Medical 
Monitor immediately upon occurrence or awareness to determine if the subject should 
continue or be discontinued from the study. 
x Adherence to the study design requirements, in cluding those specified in the Schedule of 
Assessments, is essential and required for study conduct. 
x Evaluations should be performed by [CONTACT_107306]. 
8.1. Screening Procedures 
Screening procedures can commence once the informed consent and data authorization/protection form have been obtained. Scre ening will be considered to have started at 
the time of the first screening activity or p rocedure and completed when all the required 
inclusion/exclusion criteria have been met and th e subject is randomized. Screening procedures 
should be completed as soon as possible, with a maximum of a 35-day window. There is no minimum duration for screening procedures and ra ndomization as long as the subject undergoes 
the required protocol-defined assessments at each  respective visit and is fully evaluated for 
eligibility based on the clinical judgment of the investigator. 
All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that potential subjects 
meet all eligibility criteria. The investigator will maintain a screening log to record details of all subjects screened and to confirm eligibility or re cord reasons for screening failure, as applicable. 
Inclusion and exclusion criteria will be reviewed by [CONTACT_165558] (Visits 1 and 2, respectively). 
For screen failure procedures, see Section 5.[ADDRESS_191911]’s right to 
withdraw consent at any time. 
Urovant Sciences Confidential Protocol URO-902-[ADDRESS_191912] signs the ICF will be recorded as adverse events. 
8.1.4. Demographics 
Demographic data collection will include sex, age, race, and ethnicity. 
8.1.5. Prior and Concomitant Medications 
Any prior OAB medications (over the past 3 y ears), any other prior medications used up to 
6 months before the Screening Visit, as well  as ongoing (concomitant) medications will be 
recorded beginning at the signing of the ICF a nd continuing until the Week 48 Safety Follow-up 
assessment. 
If additional OAB medication(s) is used or procedures are performed at Week 24 or after (see 
Section 6.9.2 ), these must be recorded in the appropriate eCRF form. 
8.2. Efficacy Assessments 
Efficacy assessments will be collected as  outlined in the Schedule of Assessments ( Section 1.3 ) 
in the form of a 3-day Bladder Diary. Information collected in the diaries will be used for assessment of the exploratory efficacy endpoints related to the number of UUI  epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841], 
micturitions, urgency epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841], and UI epi[INVESTIGATOR_165519] 24-hr period to record 
volume voided of urine. 
Subjects will complete questionnaires at the site during the study visits specified in the Schedule 
of Assessments ( Section 1.3 ) before vital signs and blood draws to assess subject-perceived 
symptom relief and health-related quality of life. The patient-reported outcome (PRO) 
questionnaires are provided in Section 10.[ADDRESS_191913] the frequency of daily OAB symptoms including 
all micturitions, urgency, UUI, UI, and main reason for incontinence, and volume voided per micturition (over one 24-hour period) by [CONTACT_165559] g the respective box for each symptom/event 
occurring during the course of a given day and night. 
Bladder diary must be completed by [CONTACT_165560] a ny 3 consecutive days in the 7 days prior to the 
visit (for screening only, it can be completed for 3 consecutive days at any time during the 
screening and randomization period); total volume voided must be collected for one 24-hour 
period during the 3-day diary coll ection period. Please refer to Section 10.7  for washout periods 
for prohibited medications. The Screening Bladde r Diary should be started only after washout of 
prohibited medications is complete. 
A “Diary Day” is defined as the time be tween when the subject gets up for the day each morning 
(ie, the time the subject got up for the day yest erday to the time the subject got up for the day 
today; approximately a 24-hour period). To be eligible for the study, subjects must ha ve a minimum of 3 consecutive Diary Days during 
the screening and randomization period (at any ti me during the period) and be capable in the 
investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_165520], including the 
measurement and recording of urine volume, as required throughout the course of the study. 
At all study visits, the site staff should inquire whether the subject had any difficulties with the 
diary and address any questions subjects may ha ve. Instructions for proper completion of the 
diary should be re-reviewed. Subjects will be tr ained to enter data immediately following each 
event (in real time) and to input data from any “m issed” events as soon as they are able. They 
will review and confirm that data from all events occurring within the preceding Diary Day 
(approximately 24 hours) have been entered at a consistent time each morning (eg, upon getting 
up for the day). 
Responses to the Bladder Diary will be reviewed by [CONTACT_165561] m eet eligibility criteria. The daily averages for 
micturitions, urgency epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841], UUI epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841], and UI  epi[INVESTIGATOR_165521]. Subjects who do not meet the OAB entry criteria will be excluded from the study. 
Note that diaries must be completed within [ADDRESS_191914]’s perception of the level of impairment in functioning and well-being associated 
with the symptoms of OAB will be assessed usi ng subject-completed questionnaires as specified 
below. Questionnaires should be administered  prior to the subject undergoing any invasive 
procedure for any study visit, prior to vital signs measurement, and prior to study treatment at the 
Day 1 Visit. The versions of the questionnaires pr ovided in the protocol are samples and will be 
replaced. Additional informati on on administering and comple ting these questionnaires is 
outlined in Section 10.9 . These include the following questionnaires: 
x Urinary Incontinence-Specific Quality-of- Life Instrument (I-QOL) total summary score 
x OAB Questionnaire (OAB-q) score 
x Patient Global Impression of Change (PGI-C) scale score 
Examples of each of the PRO measures are provided in Section 10.[ADDRESS_191915] 
eligibility during the Randomization Visit (Visit 2) prior to performing the actual randomization 
procedure. A historical urodynamic study, performed no more than [ADDRESS_191916] day 
of screening, may serve as the ba seline urodynamic assessment if the criteria detailed below are 
satisfied.  
Historical urodynamic study may be substituted for the baseline urodynamic assessment, if the 
following 3 criteria are met: 
x Historical urodynamic study was obtained no more than [ADDRESS_191917] was not being treated with any OAB medication or had discontinued OAB 
treatment in accordance with Exclusion Criterion #[ADDRESS_191918] guidelines [ Homma 2002 ]. 
Urodynamic data will be reviewed by [CONTACT_165562] t central reviewer to determine final values 
for analysis purposes for the parameters listed below. The investigator, physician subinvestigator, or trained technician will perform urodynamic procedures on each subject, then interpret and record the results on the calculati on worksheet. The worksheet and the tracings 
should be signed and dated by [CONTACT_165563]. A test trace will be submitted by [CONTACT_25733]. A copy of the worksheet , along with the printed tracings will be 
submitted to the central reader. Only the cent ral reader’s interpretation of the results will be 
recorded in the eCRF for final analysis. Study sites will not typi[INVESTIGATOR_165522]. However, study sites may rece ive feedback if persistent methodological issues 
arise per the central urodynamic reader. Note that the investigator does not need to wait for the 
results of the baseline urodynamic assessment to rule out bladder outlet obstruction if there are no other signs or symptoms of obstruction, in the investigator’s assessment, including elevated PVR volume (see Exclusion Criterion  13). 
The following urodynamic parameters are to be measured: 
x Cystometric volume at 1
st sensation to void (FSV) 
x Maximum cystometric capacity (MCC) 
x Maximum detrusor pressure during the storage phase (corrected Pdet MaxStorage ) 
x Presence/absence of the first involuntary detrusor contraction (IDC) and, if present: 
o Volume at first IDC (Vol@1stIDC)  
o Maximum detrusor pressure during the first IDC (corrected P det@1stIDC) 
Additional related instructions will be provided in the appropriate study manual. 
8.3. Pharmacokinetic Assessments 
Urine and blood samples for hSlo cDNA assessment will be co llected pre-treatment from 
subjects on Day 1 (Visit 3; treatment admini stration), 2 hours (± 1 hour) post-treatment on 
Day 1, Week 6 follow-up clinic visit (Visit 5), and Week 24 follow-up clinic/exit visit (Visit 8). 
If a specimen(s) is still positive at Week 24, per the clinical discretion of the investigator, a subject may be instructed to return at Week 36 (Visit 9) and, if necessary, Week 48 (Visit 10) 
until the specimen(s) result is negative for hSlo cDNA. Pharmacokinetic assessment is to be 
performed at the Early Withdrawal Visit for subjects who withdraw early from the study. Information on procedures for collection, handling, storage, and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_165523] a separate study manual. 
Urovant Sciences Confidential Protocol URO-902-2001 
Version 3.0 51 19 February 2021 8.4. Safety Assessments 
Planned timepoints for all safety assessments are provided in the Schedule of Assessments 
(Section 1.3 ). Immediate safety concerns should be discussed with the Sponsor’s designated 
Medical Monitor immediately upon occurrence or awareness to determine if the subject should 
continue or discontinue study drug. 
8.4.1. Vital Signs 
x Vital signs, including blood pressure (mmHg) , heart rate (by [CONTACT_117682]; beats per minute), 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487] (breaths per minute), and body temperature (°C) will be assessed at the 
timepoints specified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Section 1.3) . 
x Blood pressure and pulse will be  measured after the subject has been resting in a seated 
position for [ADDRESS_191919] clothing with jacket/coat and shoes 
removed, using the same scale throughout the study, if possible. 
x Standing height will be measured  at screening only. 
8.4.2. Physical Examinations 
Brief physical examinations will include examination of the heart, lungs, abdomen, and visual 
pelvic examination. In addition, any organ system in which a previous abnormality was noted during screening or a subject has a complaint or AE will be examined. 
8.4.3. Electrocardiograms 
A 12-lead ECG will be performed in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_165524] ( Section 1.3 ) using an ECG machine that automatically calculates the heart rate and 
measures PR, QRS, QT, and QTc  intervals. ECGs will be read by [CONTACT_165564]. 8.4.4. Post-Void Residual Volume 
The volume of urine that remains in the bladder after voiding (PVR) is an objective measurement 
that may serve as a proxy for impaired ability to  void. The physician should assess subjects with 
an increase in PVR volume to determine wh ether an AE should be reported. (Refer to 
Section 8.5.6  for additional information on reporting AEs of urinary retention associated with 
increased PVR.)  
Urovant Sciences Confidential Protocol URO-902-2001 
Version 3.0 52 19 February 2021 The PVR assessment will be performed via ultrasound at the visits indicated in the Schedule of 
Assessments ( Section 1.3 ). Note that since Visit 7 (Week 18) is a telephone (or other virtual 
technology) visit, subjects will not be seen in th e clinic for 12 weeks between Visit 6 (Week 12) 
and Visit 8 (Week 24). Should the investigator identify a clinically relevant elevation in PVR volume at Visit 6, an unscheduled clinic visit should be performed at the investigator’s discretion 
to repeat the urine PVR assessments and urine dips tick. All efforts should be made to ensure the 
same device and operator are used for all PVR volume measurements for individual subjects.  
8.4.5. Clean Intermittent Catheterization 
The following guidance should be used for the initiation of CIC in this study. Sterile, single-use 
intermittent catheters should be used. Indwelling catheters should not be used in this study. 
Initiation of Clean Intermittent Catheterization 
As described above in the PVR section, CIC shou ld be initiated per protocol when one of the 
following criteria is fulfilled: 
x PVR is ≥ [ADDRESS_191920] reports 
associated symptoms 
x PVR is ≥ 200 mL and < [ADDRESS_191921] spontaneously reports associated 
symptoms (ie, voiding difficulties, sensation of bladder fullness) that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_165525]. 
The following will occur when initiating CIC (for elevated PVR as described above): 
1. CIC is implemented and the subject should be  instructed to perform CIC using sterile, 
single-use catheters (which will  be provided to the subject) 
2. An adverse event of urinary retention is recorded 
3. Central laboratory urine analysis and culture/s ensitivity are performed as per routine 
requirements at each study visit 
4. The subject will be seen for a follow-up visit 1 week later where the PVR, associated 
symptoms, central laboratory urine analysis a nd culture/sensitivity will be reassessed. 
The investigator will determine whether the subject can then be followed per protocol 
scheduled study visits or whether additional follow-up visits should occur. 
Once CIC is initiated, the status of CIC use should be documented in the subject record at each 
visit (ie, use/nonuse). 
Cessation of Clean Intermittent Catheterization CIC should be discontinued when the following criteria are fulfilled: 
x the subject does not have any associated symptoms which in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_165526]-902-2001 
Version 3.0 53 19 February 2021 x the PVR is < [ADDRESS_191922] will be seen for a 
follow-up visit 1 week later where the PVR, associated symptoms, ce ntral laboratory urine 
analysis and culture/sensitivity will be reasse ssed. The investigator will determine whether the 
subject can then be followed at regularly sche duled study visits or whether additional follow-up 
visits should occur based on PVR and/or associated symptoms. 
8.4.6. Clinical Safety Laboratory Assessments 
All protocol-defined laboratory assessments must be conducted in accordance with the 
laboratory manual and the Schedule of Assessments ( Section 1.3 ). See Section 10.[ADDRESS_191923] resu lts will be evaluated as follows: 
x At screening, the investigator or physician subinvestigator will assess the clinical 
significance of any values outside the reference ranges provided by [CONTACT_25699], and subjects with abnormalities judged to be clinically significant will be excluded from the study. 
x The investigator or physician subinvestigator must review the laboratory report, document 
this review, and record any clinically relevant changes occurring during the study in the AE 
section of the eCRF. The la boratory reports must be filed with the source documents. 
Laboratory abnormalities associated with the underlying disease are not considered c linically 
significant unless judged by [CONTACT_165565]’s condition.  
x All laboratory tests with values considered cl inically significant during participation in the 
study should be repeated until the values return to normal or baseline or are no longer 
considered clinically significant by [CONTACT_76617]’s designated Medical 
Monitor. 
- If such values do not return to normal/baseline within a period of time judged reasonable 
by [CONTACT_093], the etiology should be identified and the Sponsor’s designated 
Medical Monitor notified. 
- If laboratory values from nonprotocol specified laboratory assessments performed at the institution’s local laboratory require a change  in subject management or are considered 
clinically significant by [CONTACT_093] (eg, SAE or AE or dose modification), then the 
results must be recorded in the eCRF. 
A urine dipstick will be performed at the study site at scheduled visits as noted in the Schedule of 
Assessments ( Section 1.3 ) and when a subject presents with symptoms of a UTI at Unscheduled 
Urovant Sciences Confidential Protocol URO-902-2001 
Version 3.0 54 19 February 2021 Visits. If the urine dipstick is positive for leukocytes, nitrites, or blood cells, then a urinalysis and 
culture/sensitivity testing will be performed on th e sample. The urinalysis should be performed at 
the central laboratory and the culture and sensitivity should be performed at the site’s designated 
local laboratory.  
If positive for nitrites and/or leukocyte esterase, indicating a possible infection, the subject 
should be treated with antibiotics per the clinica l judgment of the investigator and in accordance 
with local site practice. Urine analysis, urine cu lture and sensitivity testing (performed from a 
sample collected on the same day as the dipstick) will be used to confirm the presence or absence of a UTI. If UTI is present, sensitivity testing will provide additional information to the investigator regarding pathogen susceptibility to the antibiotic selected for treatment based on the 
positive dipstick. 
x Screening urine dipstick reagent strip test  results: If positive, the screening and 
randomization period can be extended to a tota l maximum of 35 days prior to randomization) 
in order to accommodate the additional time requi red for antibiotic treatment. Some of the 
screening procedures may be repeated, as dee med clinically necessary, at the discretion of 
the investigator (eg, repeat the Screening B ladder Diary if subject had a symptomatic UTI 
during initial diary collection). 
x Day 1 (treatment administration) urine dipstick reagent strip test results: Subjects with a 
dipstick positive for nitrites and/or leukocyte esterase on Day 1 (Visit 3) do not meet “day of 
treatment criteria” and therefore must not receive study treatment. The subject should be 
treated with antibiotics per the clinical judgmen t of the investigator and in accordance with 
local site practice and may then return for a resc heduled treatment Day 1 Visit within 10 days 
(but within a total maximum of 35 days of starting screening procedures). If the dipstick 
obtained at the rescheduled Day 1/treatment administration visit is negative for nitrites and leukocyte esterase and all “day of tr eatment criteria” are fulfilled, the subject can be treated. 
Urine cytology: Urine cytology is performed at  the Screening Visit (Visit 1) only. Abnormal 
urine cytology suspi[INVESTIGATOR_271] a urothelial maligna ncy should be investigated by [CONTACT_165566], and only if such  malignancy is ruled out should the subject be 
enrolled. Results of the investigation will be recorded in the source documents. 
8.4.7. Bladder and Kidney Ultrasound 
Abdominal ultrasound of the bladder and kidneys will be performed with the bladder at least half 
full. Subjects are excluded from this study if the screening ultrasound demonstrates the presence 
of bladder stones and/or intra-luminal filling de fects of the bladder suggestive of malignancy. In 
the case of unclear new findings identified at the exit visit, an ultrasound which may be 
suggestive of stones (kidney, ureter, or bladder), other diagnostic measures must be performed in order to confirm the presence of stones, rule out bladder malignancy (eg, x-ray with or without contrast, urogram, computed tomography (CT) scan, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or 
cystoscopy and histopathological confirmation). 
Urovant Sciences Confidential Protocol URO-902-2001 
Version 3.0 55 19 February 2021 8.4.8. Immunogenicity Blood Sample (Optional) 
If the subject consents, blood samples for po tential future immunogenicity testing will be 
collected at the timepoints specified in  the Schedule of Assessments (Section 1.3) and stored for 
up to [ADDRESS_191924]’s sampl e will be 
appropriately discarded. Sample co llection is limited to subjects who are able to provide a blood 
sample prior to administration of study tr eatment on Day 1 (Visit 3) (Cohort 2 only).  
8.5. Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events 
The definitions of an AE and SAE can be found in Section 10.[ADDRESS_191925] (or, when appropriate, by a caregiver, surrogate, or the 
subject’s legally authorized representative).  
The investigator and any qualified designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and 
recording events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE  and remain responsible for following 
up AEs that are serious, considered related to the study drug or study procedures, or that caused the subject to discontinue the study drug or the study (see Section 7). 
8.5.1. Time Period and Frequency for Collect ing Adverse Event and Serious Adverse 
Event Information 
All AEs and SAEs will be collected from the signing of the ICF through 30 days after the end of 
the study at the timepoints specified in the Schedule of Assessments (Section 1.3), and as 
observed or reported spontaneously by [CONTACT_4866]. Medical occurrences that begin before the 
start of study drug, but after obtaining informed consent will be recorded in the AE section of the eCRF. 
All SAEs (including serious adverse events of special interest [AESIs]) will be recorded and 
reported on the eCRF within 24 hours of the study site personnel’s knowledge of the event.  
Marking the event as “serious” will automatical ly send required notific ations for Sponsor or 
designee review. The investigator will also s ubmit any updated SAE data within 24 hours of 
receipt of the information.  
Nonserious AESIs will be reported on the eCRF within 72 hours  of the site’s knowledge of the 
information. 
Investigators are not obligated to actively seek  AE or SAE information after conclusion of the 
study participation. However, if the investigat or learns of any SAE, including a death, at any 
time after a subject has been discharged from the study, and he/she considers the event to be 
reasonably related to the study drug or study participation, the investigator must promptly notify the Sponsor or designee. 
Urovant Sciences Confidential Protocol URO-902-[ADDRESS_191926] 
at subsequent visits/contacts. All SAEs will be  followed until resolution, stabilization, the event 
is otherwise explained, or the subject is lost to follow-up (as defined in Section 7.2 ). If a subject 
dies during participation in the study, the investigator will provide the Sponsor or designee with a copy of any available postmortem findings in cluding an autopsy report with histopathology. 
The investigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental measurements and/or evaluations as medically indicated or as requested by [CONTACT_165567]/or causality of  the AE or SAE as fully as possible. This may 
include additional laboratory te sts or investigations, histopathological examinations, or 
consultation with other health care professionals. 
New or updated information will be recorded in the originally completed eCRF. As noted above, 
the investigator will submit any updated SAE data to the Sponsor or designee within 24 hours of 
receipt of the information. 
8.5.4. Regulatory Reporting Requirements for Serious Adverse Events 
x Prompt notification of an SAE by [CONTACT_165568] a study drug under clinical investigation are met.  
x The Sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and other regulatory agencies about the safety of a study drug under clinical investigation. The Sponsor will comply with country-specific regulatory requirements relating to safety reporting to the regulatory authority, Institutional Review Bo ards (IRBs)/Independent Ethics Committees 
(IECs), and investigators.  
x Investigator safety reports must be prepared  for suspected unexpected serious adverse 
reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) according to local regulatory requirements and Sponsor policy and forwarded to investigators as necessary. 
x An investigator who receives an investigat or safety report describing an SAE or other 
specific safety information (eg, summary or listing of SAEs) from the Sponsor or designee 
will review and then file it and will notify the IRB/IEC, if appropriate according to local 
requirements. 
Urovant Sciences Confidential Protocol URO-902-2001 
Version 3.0 57 19 February 2021 8.5.5. Disease-Related Events and/or Disease-Related Outcomes Not Qualifying as 
Adverse Events or Serious Adverse Events 
No disease-related events or outcomes are excluded from AE reporting. 
8.5.6. Adverse Events of Special Interest 
Selected nonserious and SAEs will be reported as AESIs. AESIs that also meet the definition of 
an SAE must be reported as described in Section 10.3. 
AESIs for this study include: 
x Adverse events consistent with urinary retention 
- An AE of urinary retention should only be recorded when a subject has a raised PVR that 
requires intervention with CIC or temporary pl acement of a urinary catheter according to the 
following criteria: 
a) subject has a PVR of ≥ 350 mL (regardless of symptoms), OR 
b) subject has a PVR ≥ 200 mL and < [ADDRESS_191927] reports associated symptoms, ie, 
sensation of bladder fullness or inability to void desp ite persistent effort, that in the investigator’s 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_165527]. Note: An AE of residual urine volume should be recorded if, in the investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], the 
raised PVR is clinically significant but does not fulfill the above definition for urinary retention. 
x Adverse events suggestive of cystitis or UTI 
- An AE of UTI will be recorded if both the following criteria are fulfilled, regardless of subject 
symptoms: 
a) a positive urine culture result with a bacteriuria count of ≥ 105 CFU/mL  
(ie, 100 × 103 CFU/mL) 
b) leukocyturia of ≥ 5/hpf 
If a subject meets the criteria for the definition of a UTI, the investigator will record whether the 
UTI was “symptomatic” or “asymptomatic” on the AE eCRF. 
Note: If urinalysis/culture results are reported  which, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], are 
considered clinically significant but do not fulf ill the above definition of a UTI, the findings 
should be recorded as AEs (eg, bacteriuria, leukocyturia). 
Urovant Sciences Confidential Protocol URO-902-2001 
Version 3.0 58 19 February 2021 8.5.7. Medication Errors 
Medication error refers to any unintended error in the dosing and/or administration of the study 
drug as per instructions in the protocol. Medicatio n errors generally fall into 4 categories as 
follows: 
x Wrong study drug 
x Wrong dose (including dosing regimen, strength, form, concentration, amount) 
x Wrong route of administration 
x Wrong subject (ie, not administ ered to the intended subject) 
Medication errors include occurrences of overdose and underdose of the study drug. 
Overdose: Unintentional administration of a qua ntity of the study drug given per administration 
or per day that is above the maximum recommended dose according to the protocol. This also 
takes into account cumulative effects due to overdose (see Section 8.6  for treatment and 
reporting of overdose). For this study, any dose of URO-902 ≥ 20% higher than the dose that the 
subject has been randomized to is an overdose. There is no known antidote for an overdose.  
Underdose: No underdose is defined for this study. 
8.6. Treatment of Overdose 
In the event of an overdose (any dose of URO-902 ≥ 20% higher than the dose that the subject 
has been randomized to), the invest igator or treating physician should: 
x Contact [CONTACT_2728]’s designated Medical Monitor immediately  
x Closely monitor the subject for any AEs, SAEs, and laboratory abnormalities 
x Report all overdose events within 24 hours of awareness by [CONTACT_3452], in the eCRF 
according to Section 10.3 , whether or not the overdose is associated with an AE 
x Document the quantity of the excess dose as well as the duration of the overdosing in the 
eCRF. 
Decisions regarding dose interruptions or modifications will be made by [CONTACT_148208]’s designated Medical Monitor  based on the clinical evaluation of 
the subject. 
Urovant Sciences Confidential Protocol URO-902-[ADDRESS_191928] ical analyses for this study; full details will be 
provided in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP). 
The randomized allocation schedule will be generated by [CONTACT_165569]. Stratification will be performed across the study (not per site). The statistical analysis of the data obtained from this study will be the responsibility of the Sponsor or designee. At the end of the study, th e official, final database will be frozen and 
unblinded after medical/scientific review has been performed, and data have been declared final and complete. The SAP will be approved prior to the final database lock. 
A subject is considered enrolled in the study at randomization. 
9.1. Statistical Hypotheses 
The study has no formal statistical primary endpoint hypothesis. The intent is to estimate the 
treatment effect of each dose group relative to placebo. For analysis of Cohort 1, subjects from Cohorts 1a and 1b will be combined. The prima ry analysis adjusted for randomization 
stratification will use the baseline UUI ( ≤ 3 vs. > 3 UUI epi[INVESTIGATOR_914]) and previous 
onabotulinumtoxinA use (naïve vs. prior use). S ubjects in Cohort 1a will be assigned to the 
onabotulinumtoxinA naïve stratum. For the final analysis, the subjects receiving placebo from Cohort [ADDRESS_191929] approximately 55% power to detect a between-group difference of 1.8 epi[INVESTIGATOR_165528] 12 in the number of UUI epi[INVESTIGATOR_165529]-902 and placebo treatment groups (based on a 2-sample t-test with a 2-sided type I error rate of 0.[ADDRESS_191930] deviation [SD] of 2.86). Furthermore, the 
half-width of the confidence interval would be the following for different SD assumptions: 
SD N per Group  Half-Width of Confidence 
Interval  Lower  
Limit  Upper  
Limit  
2.[ADDRESS_191931] attrition (approxim ately 10%), the sample size was increased to 
26 subjects for each treatment group, amounting to  a total of 78 randomized subjects required for 
exploratory efficacy analyses in both Cohort 1 (n = 39) and Cohort 2 (n = 39). 
Urovant Sciences Confidential Protocol URO-902-2001 
Version 3.0 60 19 February 2021 9.3. Analyses Populations 
The following analysis populations will be evaluated: safety, safety (modified), and intent-to-
treat exposed (ITT-E). 
ITT-E will be used for demographics, baseline ch aracteristics, and efficacy analyses. The ITT-E 
population will consist of all subjects randomized and treated from Cohorts [ADDRESS_191932] of all subjects from Cohorts 1 and 2 who were randomized and 
received study drug and will be used to analyz e all safety endpoints based on actual treatment 
received. A separate safety population, safety (m odified), will be created to assess safety 
excluding subjects who received additional OA B medication at Week [ADDRESS_191933] has marked “urge” as the main reason for the leakage as indicated on the Bladder 
Diary; regardless of whether more than one reason for leakage in addition to “ urge” is checked. 
Average daily number of UUI epi[INVESTIGATOR_165530], which is completed prior to each study visit. Average daily number of UUI epi[INVESTIGATOR_165531] a Diary Day divided by [CONTACT_165570]. 
A micturition is defined as “Urinated in Toilet” as indicated on the Bladder Diary. Average daily 
micturitions at each study visit will be calculated  in the same manner as described above for UUI 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]. 
Urinary incontinence is defined as having any reason for leakage or “Accidental Urine Leakage” 
as indicated on the Bladder Diary. 
An urgency epi[INVESTIGATOR_165532] “Need to Urinate Immediately” as indicated on the Bladder  
Diary. 
Exploratory Efficacy Endpoints are listed in Section 3.2.[ADDRESS_191934] error, and 95% confidence intervals (CI) 
will be presented for each treatment group and the difference between each dose group relative 
to placebo. Nominal p-values from comparisons  from each dose group re lative to placebo may 
be provided for descriptive purposes. 
Baseline will be define d as the diary assessments collected prior to randomization for all diary 
related efficacy endpoints and results of the questi onnaires collected at the Day 1 Visit (Visit 3) 
for all health outcome endpoints. For the analysis of continuous change from base line endpoints (eg, change from baseline in 
average daily number of UUI ep isodes, change from baseline in average daily number of 
micturitions, change from baseline in average da ily number of UI epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841], change from baseline 
in average daily number of urgency epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841], ch ange from baseline in average volume voided 
per micturition, change from base line in average I-QOL total summary score, change from 
baseline in OAB-q score, and change from base line in PGI-C score), a mixed-effect model for 
repeated measures (MMRM) with restricted maximum likelihood estimation will be used. 
Analysis will be stratified by [CONTACT_165571] f actors assuming there are greater than [ADDRESS_191935] for a drop-out 
free population. 
The analysis model for each efficacy endpoint wi ll include terms for treatment, visit, visit by 
[CONTACT_165572], and baseline score as covariates. If warranted, non-parametric 
methods will be used. For interim analyses, analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) may be 
performed instead of MMRM due to limited sample size. If there is a sufficient sample size, 
randomization factors will be considered for use in the model. Data for all visits will also be presented. 
Urovant Sciences Confidential Protocol URO-902-2001 
Version 3.0 62 19 February 2021 The proportion of subjects who has ≥ 50% reduction from baseline in UUI epi[INVESTIGATOR_67661] 12 
will be calculated for each treatment group. In  addition, responder analyses will also be 
calculated for subjects who achieve ≥ 75% and 100% decrease in epi[INVESTIGATOR_165510] 12 
relative to baseline. The Cochran-Mantel-Haensze l (CMH) method will be utilized to compare 
the proportion of responders between the acti ve and placebo groups by [CONTACT_165545]. Data for all visits will  also be presented. Further details of handling of 
missing data will be described in the SAP. 
For the urodynamic variables evaluated, only the independent central reviewer’s interpretation 
will be analyzed. 
9.5.2. Safety Analyses 
Safety analysis will be conducted using the safety population and summarized by [CONTACT_6490]. The treatment-emergent period will be defined as the period from initial exposure of the study drug through [ADDRESS_191936] version of Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA; version 21.0 or higher). All reported AE s (whether treatment emergent or not) will 
be included in by-patient AE listings. The severity of all adverse events will be evaluated by [CONTACT_093]. The incidence of the adverse events  will be presented by [CONTACT_39812], relationship to study treatment, and severity. Treatment emergent AESIs and 
treatment related AESIs will also be summar ized by [CONTACT_9313] (SOC) and preferred 
term (PT). A list of all AESIs can be found in Section 8.5.[ADDRESS_191937] void 
residual volume will be listed and summarized. 
Supplemental safety analyses will be performed to separate subjects that did or did not receive 
additional OAB treatment at or after Week 24. Tables that are to be repeated with the alternative 
safety population will be desc ribed further in the SAP. 
9.6. Multiplicity 
All efficacy endpoints will be considered descri ptive and no multiplicity adjustments will be 
performed for these endpoints. 
Urovant Sciences Confidential Protocol URO-902-2001 
Version 3.0 63 19 February 2021 9.7. Subgroup Analyses 
Subgroup analyses of endpoints may be conduc ted. Additional details of any planned subgroup 
analyses will be provided in the SAP. 
9.8. Planned Analyses 
9.8.1. Interim Analyses 
Two or more interim analyses may be conducted; when ≥  50% of subjects in Cohort 1, and/or 
when ≥  50% of subjects in Cohort [ADDRESS_191938]-randomization (or prematurely exited the study prior to Week 12). Any interim analysis 
performed is for future planning purposes. 
The planned interim analysis will be conducted to evaluate the objectives of the protocol at 
Week 12. These analyses will be performed after the completion of the following steps: 
x All subjects in Cohorts [ADDRESS_191939] comple ted Week 12 (or prematurely exited the study 
prior to Week 12) 
x All required database cleaning activities have  been completed and final database release 
and freeze has been declared by [CONTACT_165573] 
x All criteria for unblinding the ra ndomization code have been met. 
For any interim analysis, the subject and the investigator or delegate(s) who are involved in the treatment or clinical evaluation of the subjects wi ll remain blinded to the treatment assignments. 
Limited personnel from the Sponsor will be unblinded (double-blind, sponsor-open design). Sponsor personnel who are directly involved with site interactions and communications (eg, study data manager and site monitors) will remain blinded to subject level treatment assignment. 
9.8.2. Final Analyses 
The planned final end-of-study analysis will be  performed once the final clinical database lock 
(after all subjects complete the study or exit the study prematurely) has been achieved and treatment codes have been unblinded to the statistics and programming team. The clinical study report will be based on final analysis results. 
9.8.3. Data and Safety Monitoring Board 
A DSMB will be retained to assess, on an ongoing basis, all safety aspects of this study including 
unblinded review of safety data after all subjects reach Week 6 (or prematurely exited the study 
prior to Week 6) in Cohort 1 (URO-902 24 m g). Randomization into Cohort 2 will begin only 
after the DSMB has recommended it is safe to proceed. This committee will be an external independent DSMB that monitors safety. The deta iled activities including meeting plans will be 
Urovant Sciences Confidential Protocol URO-902-2001

The Sponsor designee reserves the right to close th e study site or terminate the study at any time 
for any reason at the sole discretion of the Sponsor. Study sites will be closed upon study 
completion. A study site is considered closed when all required documents and study supplies have been collected, and a study-sit e closure visit has been performed. 
The investigator may initiate study-site closure at  any time, provided there is reasonable cause 
and sufficient notice is given in advance of the intended termination. 
Reasons for the early closure of a study site by [CONTACT_23863]: 
x Failure of the investigator to comply with the protocol, the requirements of the IRB/IEC/REB 
or local health authorities, the Sp onsor’s procedures, or GCP guidelines 
x Inadequate recruitment of subjects by [CONTACT_093] 
x Discontinuation of further study drug development

x The Sponsor has proprietary interest in this study. Authorship and manuscript composition 
will reflect joint cooperation between mult iple investigators and sites and Sponsor or 
designee personnel. Authorship will be established prior to the writing of the manuscript. As 
this study involves multiple centers, no indivi dual publications will be allowed prior to 
completion of the final report of the multicen ter study except as agreed with the Sponsor. 
x The Sponsor will comply with the requirements for publication of study results. In 
accordance with standard editorial and ethica l practice, the Sponsor will generally support 
publication of multicenter studies only in thei r entirety and not as individual site data. 
Urovant Sciences Confidential Protocol URO-902-[ADDRESS_191944] with the investigator and his/her

and Instructions 
Information on each of the scales and questionnaires for patient-reported outcomes are provided 
below. A sample for each assessment is also provided. 
10.9.1. Incontinence-Specific Quality-of-Life Instrument (I-QOL) 
The I-QOL is a validated, disease-specific quality of life questionnaire designed to measure the 
impact of urinary incontinence on patients’ lives [Patrick 1999 ]. It contains 22 items and is 
designed for self-administration, requiring approx imately 5 minutes to complete. The response 
options and values for each item are: “Extremely” (value = 1), “Quite a bit” (value = 2), “Moderately” (value = 3), “A little” (value = 4), and “Not at all” (value = 5). A total summary score is calculated based on the 22 items; additi onally, three domain scores (Avoidance and 
Limiting Behavior, Psychosocial Impact, and Social Embarrassment) can be calculated based on 
responses to items corresponding to each respective domain. The total summary and domain scores range from [ADDRESS_191950]

CONFIDENTIAL  1 Introduction  
 
This document is a protocol for a human research study. This study is to be conducted according to US and international standards of Good Clinical Practice (FDA Title 21 part 312 and International Conference on Harmonization guidelines), applicable government regulations and Institutional research policies and procedures.  
1.1 Background  
Conventional dental implant therapy as described by [CONTACT_583292] 3 decades ago involves 3 -6 
months of healing prior to functional loading following surgical endosseous dental implant placement (Branemark 1983).  In the protocol, the implants are buried under the gingival tissues until full healing is completed.  Improved dental implant surface technology and osseointegration potential, along with improved understanding of the biology and mechanics of dental implants has led to loading protocols that involve less time for implant healing prior to functional loading.  Commonly for single dental implants, loading is completed at 8 weeks, termed early loading (Bornstein et al. 2005, Cooper et al. 2001). 
Although dental implants typi[INVESTIGATOR_583288] (occlusion) until 8- 12 weeks, immediate 
provisionaliza tion is a procedure commonly provided in the course of dental implant therapy (Cornelini et al. 2005, 
Degidi et al. 2006, Drago et al. 2004).  This protocol involves placing a provisional restoration on the implant that is 
out of function during the healing period further reducing the time for a patient to have a fixed tooth in the edentulous area.  
Although dental implant therapy is considered the gold standard for tooth replacement therapy in most clinical situations, a common concern among practitioners and patients preventing the application of the procedure is the time involved to completion. Even when provisionalization of the implant is completed immediately, a conventional final impression is needed following healing of the dental implant.  The patien t is then reappointed for delivery of 
the final abutment and indirect crown restoration.  Depending on the loading protocol, treatment can take as long as 3-5 months to complete. 
Using cone beam computed tomography, software is available allowing precise v irtual placement of an implant and 
creation of a milled guide from the plan (D’haese et al. 2010).  This milled surgical guide allows the surgeon to 
place the implant precisely as planned using the patient’s CBCT information.  Utilizing this virtual plan, it is theoretically possible to fabricate a CAD/CAM patient specific abutment prior to surgery.   This allows delivery of 
the abutment either at surgery or at delivery of the crown following osseointegration.  Ultimately, fabrication of the final abutment prior to surgery removes that current necessity of appointing the patient for the final impression.  Following surgical implant placement, the next appointment for the patient would be delivery of the final crown.  Dental implant therapy could be reduced to 8 weeks of total therapy and 2 total appointments. 
While guided surgery for the placement of the implant fixture is extremely precise and is milled from the virtual 
plan using the patient’s CBCT information, surgical guides can have minor error leaving the implant in a position slightly different from the information in the virtual software (Turbush et al. 2012, Sarment et al. 2003).  If the abutment and/or crown are produced prior to surgery, these slight differences in the virtual vs. actual position of the implant may provide an abutment and/or crown that either doesn’t fit or is esthetically unpleasing. 
It is the interest of this study to investigate the possibility of creating a patient specific abutment and provisional 
crown prior to surgery that is f unctionally and esthetically pleasing.   With this treatment possibility, the time and 
expense involved with single tooth dental implant therapy will be reduced allowing a better experience for both patient and provider. 
1.2 Clinical Data to Date  
There is no available clinical data that pertains to this study in which this protocol developed by [CONTACT_583293]-Tech is used to fabricate custom Atlantis abutments prior to guided surgery.

CONFIDENTIAL  2 Study Objectives 
Purpose:  To evaluate the possibility of fabricating an ideal CAD/CAM custom abutment that adequately supports 
the hard and soft tissues in a single edentulous space prior to guided surgery.  Evaluation of the custom abutment 
will be completed at [ADDRESS_766815] operatively, with abutment exposure being the primary outcome at follow -up.  
With knowledge of fabricating the definitive CAD/CAM abutment prior to surgery, soft tissue development can begin immediately and restoration of the implant can be completed without subsequent soft tissue trauma during crown fabrication.  
Participants: The study will seek [ADDRESS_766816] a bound edentulous space who 
seek restoration with a dental implant crown. 
Procedures (methods): This is a convenience sample, we will recruit subjects who present to the gradua te 
prosthodontics clinic or inquire about the study will be eligible to receive dental implant surgery with subsequent 
definitive abutment and provisional crown delivery at eight weeks.  The group will then be randomly split with half 
of the group receiving a custom abutment with margin placement .5mm sub- gingivally and half of the group 
receiving a custom abutment with margin placement 1.[ADDRESS_766817] evaluation of the site, surgical placement of the dental implant, restoration of the 
dental implant and associated follow -ups at 7 days, 8 weeks, 11 weeks and 24 weeks.  
3.2 Primary Study Endpoints 
The primary objective is to compare differences in margin exposure of the abutment between baseline to 6 months later.  
3.3 Secondary Study Endpoints  
Secondary Objectives include measurement of  the soft tissue response based on the condition of the peri -implant 
mucosa (bleeding on probing) as well as provisional crown fit.

7 Safety and Adverse Events  
7.1 Definitions  
Unanticipated Problems Involving Risk to Subjects or Others  
Any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the following criteria:  
• Unexpected i n nature, severity, or frequency   (i.e. not described in study -related documents such 
as the IRB -approved protocol or consent form, the investigators brochure, etc)  
• Related or possibly related to participation in the research  (i.e. possibly related means there is a 
reasonable possibility that the incident experience, or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_3459],  
• Serious  (as defined below)  “ Serious” is different than “severe” as reported in the CTC 
criteria that applies a grade to the AE.  
 
Adverse Event  
An adverse event  (AE) is any symptom, sign, illness or experience that develops or worsens in severity 
during the course of the study.  Intercurrent illnesses or injuries should be regarded as adverse events.  
Abnormal results of  diagnostic procedures are considered to be adverse events if the abnormality:  
• results in study withdrawal  
• is associated with a serious adverse event  
Guided Surgery with Atlantis Abutment   Page 9 
Version: 9/4/2014  
CONFIDENTIAL  • is associated with clinical signs or symptoms  
• leads to additional treatment or to further diagnostic tests  
• is considered by [CONTACT_15369] -serious.  A serious adverse event  is any AE that is:  
• fatal 
• life-threatening  
• requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]  
• results  in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
• an important medical event  
 
Important medical events are those that may not be immediately life threatening, but are clearly of major clinical significance.   They may jeopardize the subject, and may require intervention to prevent one of the 
other serious outcomes noted above.  For example, drug overdose or abuse, a seizure that did not result in in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or intensive treatment of bronchospasm in an emergency department would 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_15355].  
 All adverse events that do not meet any of the criteria for serious should be regarded as non-serious 
adverse events .  
 
Adverse Event Reporting Period  
The study period during which adverse ev ents must be reported is normally defined as the period from 
the initiation of any study procedures to the end of the study treatment follow -up.  For this study, the study 
treatment follow -up is defined as [ADDRESS_766833] administration of study  treatment.   
 
Preexisting Condition  
A preexisting condition is one that is present at the start of the study.  A preexisting condition should be recorded as an adverse event if the frequency, intensity, or the character of the condition worsens during the study period.  
 
General Physical Examination Findings  
At screening, any clinically significant abnormality should be recorded as a preexisting condition.  At the 
end of the study, any new clinically significant findings/abnormalities that meet the definition of an adverse event must also be recorded and documented as an adverse event.   
 Post-study Adverse Event  
All unresolved adverse events should be followed by [CONTACT_1374], the subject is lost to follow -up, or the adverse event is otherwise explained.  At the last scheduled visit, the 
investigator should instruct each subject to report any subsequent event(s) that the subject, or the 
subject’s personal physician, believes might reasonably be related to participation in this  study.  The 
investigator should notify the study sponsor of any death or adverse event occurring at any time after a 
subject has discontinued or terminated study participation that may reasonably be related to this study.  The sponsor should also be notified if the investigator should become aware of the development of cancer or of a congenital anomaly in a subsequently conceived offspring of a subject that has participated in this study.  
 
Abnormal Laboratory Values  
A clinical laboratory abnormality should be documented as an adverse event if any one of the following
 
conditions is met:   
• The laboratory abnormality is not otherwise refuted by a repeat test to confirm the abnormality  
• The abnormality suggests a disease and/or organ toxicity  
Guided Surgery with Atlantis Abutment   Page 10  
Version: 9/4/2014  
CONFIDENTIAL  • The abnormality is of a degree that requires active management; e.g. change of dose, 
discontinuation of the drug, more frequent follow -up assessments, further diagnostic investigation, 
etc. 
 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], Prolonged Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_583291] a serious adverse event unless specifically instructed otherwise in this protocol.  Any condition responsible for surgery should be documented as an adverse event if the condition meets the 
criteria for and adverse event.   
 
Neither the condition, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], nor surgery are reported as an adverse event in the following circumstances:  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14841] a preexisting condition.  Surgery should not be reported as an outcome of an adverse event if the 
purpose of the surgery was elective or diagnostic and the outcome was uneventful.  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14842].  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14843], unless it 
is a worsening or increase in frequency of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_28690].  
7.[ADDRESS_766834] seek information on adverse events by [CONTACT_5147], as appropriate, by [CONTACT_5148].  Information on all adverse events should be recorded immediately  in the source document, and also in the appropriate adverse event module of the case report 
form (CRF).  All clearly related signs, symptoms, and abnormal diagnostic procedures results should recorded in the source document, though should be grouped under  one diagnosis.  
 All adverse events occurring during the study period must be recorded.  The clinical course of each event should be followed until resolution, stabilization, or until it has been determined that the study treatment or participation is not the cause.  Serious adverse events that are still ongoing at the end of the study period must be followed up to determine the final outcome.  Any serious adverse event that occurs after the study period and is considered to be possibly related to the study  treatment or study participation should 
be recorded and reported immediately.  
7.[ADDRESS_766835] be reported are those that are:  
• related to study participation,  
• unexpected, and  
• serious or involve risks to subjects or others  
(see definitions, section 8.1).   
If the report is supplied as a narrative, the minimum necessary information to be provided at the time of the initial report includes:  
• Study identifier  
• Study Center  
• Subject number  
• A description of the event  
• Date of onset  • Current status  
• Whether study treatment was discontinued 
• The reason why the event is classified as serious  
• Investigator assessment of the association 
between the event and study treatment

CONFIDENTIAL  Investigator reporting:   
 
For reportable deaths, the initial submission to the UNC IRB may be  made by [CONTACT_65803]. The AE/Unanticipated Problem Form is required as a follow up to the initial submission.  
Other Reportable events:  
For clinical drug trials, the following events are also reportable to the UNC IRB: 
• Any adverse experience that, even without detailed analysis, represents a serious unexpected adverse event that is rare in the absence of drug exposure (such as agranulocytosis, hepatic necrosis, 
Stevens -Johnson syndrome).  
• Any adverse event that would cause the sponsor to modify the investigators brochure, protocol or  
informed consent form, or would prompt other action by [CONTACT_116628]. 
• Information that indicates a change to the risks or potential benefits of the research, in terms of 
severity or frequency. For example:  
– An interim analysis indicates that participants have a lower rate of response to treatment than 
initially expected.  
– Safety monitoring indicates that a particular side effect is more severe, or more frequent than 
initially expected.  
– A paper is published from another study that shows that an arm of your research study is of no therapeutic value.  
• Change in FDA safety labeling or withdrawal from marketing of a drug, device, or biologic used in 
a research protocol . 
• Breach of confidentiality  
• Change to the protocol taken without prior IRB review to eliminate apparent immediate hazard to a 
research participant.  
• Incarceration of a participant when the research was not previously approved under Subpart C and the investi gator believes it is in the best interest of the subject to remain on the study.  
• Complaint of a participant when the complaint indicates unexpected risks or the complaint cannot be resolved by [CONTACT_5051].  
• Protocol violation (meaning an accidental or  unintentional deviation from the IRB approved 
protocol) that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_116576], or 
affects the rights or welfare of subjects.  
Sponsor reporting: Notifying the FDA  
 The study sponsor is required to report certain study events in an expedited fashion to the FDA.  These written notifications of adverse events are referred to as IND safety reports. The following describes the safety reporting requirements by [CONTACT_28822]:  
 
• Within 7 calendar days  
Any study event that is
: 
– associated with the use of the study drug 
– unexpected,  
– fatal or life- threatening, and  
 
• Within 15 calendar days 
Any study event that is : 
– associated with the use of the study drug,  
– unexpected , and 
– serious, but not fatal or life- threatening  
Guided Surgery with Atlantis Abutment   Page 12  
Version: 9/4/2014  
CONFIDENTIAL  -or- 
– a previous adverse event that was not initially deemed reportable but is later found to fit the 
criteria for reporting (reporting within 15 calendar days from when event was deemed reportable).  
Any finding from tests in laboratory animals that:  
– suggest a significant risk for human subjects including reports of mutagenicity, teratogenicity, or carcinogenicity.  
 
Additional reporting requirements  
Sponsors are also required to identify in IND safety reports  all previous reports concerning similar 
adverse events and to analyze the significance of the current event in light of the previous reports.  
 Reporting Process  
Adverse events may be submitted on FDA Form 3500A or in a narrative format. If supplied as in a 
narrative format, the minimum information to be supplied is noted above at the beginning of section 8.3. 
The contact [CONTACT_15373]:  
 
[ADDRESS_766836] of 1996 (HIPAA).  Those regulations require a signed subject authorization informing the subject of the following:  
• What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from subjects in this study  
• Who will have access to that information and why  
• Who will use or disclose that information  
• The rights of a research subject to revoke their authorization for use of their PHI.   
 In the event that a subject revokes authorization to collect or use PHI, the investigator, by [CONTACT_5151], retains the ability to use all information collected prior to the revocation of subject authorization.  For subjects that have revoked authorization to collect or use PHI, attempts should be made to obtain permission to collect at least vital status (i.e. that the subject is alive) at the end of their scheduled study period.

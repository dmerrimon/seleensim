Evaluation of the Clinical benefit of the hearing aids tinnitus feature  – 
ID# 481  
  
1 Objectives and hypotheses of the clinical investigation  
1.1 Purpose of the clinical investigation claims for clinical performance, 
effectiveness or safety of the investigational device that are to be verified  
This clinical study was conducted with commercially available hearing devices to verify the clinical 
benefit of a haring aids tinnitus feature . The study (and the resulting clinical data) could support the CER  
for claims purposes . 
1.2 Primary and Secondary Objectives  
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the clinical benefit of a noiser feature for tinnitus relief 
in 30 participants with mild to moderate sensorineural  hearing loss  and chronic bothersome tinnitus . 
2 Design of the clinical investigation 
2.1 General  
2.1.1  Design Type  
This is a randomized , cross -over confirmatory study with participants serving as self-controls . Tinnitus 
Functional Index questionnaire (TFI) will be the outcome measurer, administered at baseline (before study intervention), and after each study condition. Baseline TFI will be compared to that after each study condition.  
There are two intervention conditions (duration of 4 weeks each): amplification -only, and 
amplification+noiser, followed by [CONTACT_14582] (4 weeks)  of intervention withdrawal.  
The outcome measurer (TFI) will be administered before and after each study condition.  
2.2 Procedures  
2.2.1  Investigation -related Procedure  
Participants will be recruited  from the overall population based on their hearing loss  and tinnitus 
intrusion levels ; Inclusion  criteria include: mild to moderate sensorineural hearing loss, chronic 
(3+months) bothersome tinnitus (determined by [CONTACT_14583] 20 points at baseline), confirmed tinnitus stability with [ADDRESS_13953] intervention condition with a hearing aid fitting  (with or without a 
masking noiser) . 
Visit 1: hearing screening, demographic information collection, first TFI screening.  
 Visit 2 : between [ADDRESS_13954] visit, to verify tinnitus stability (via 2nd TFI 
measurement). If TFI confirms stable Tinnitus condition, participant will be randomly assigned  to one 
intervention condition and can be fit with hearing aids on the same session.  
Visit 3: TFI administration, and second intervention condition set up  
Visit 4: TFI administration and devices will be returned  
Visit 5: TFI administration  
3 Statistical design and analysis  
3.1 Determination of Sample Size  
We will recruit 30 participants in total;  
3.2 Statistical criteria of termination of trial  
n/a 
3.[ADDRESS_13955] significant effects with amplification -only and 
amplification+noiser as fixed effects variables, and participants as a random effects variable. Post -hoc 
pairwise t -tests will identify further differences.  
3.3.[ADDRESS_13956] appointment. Participants  are asked to review the entirety of the 
form and ask questions about the content in the form, if any.  Participants consent by [CONTACT_14584].

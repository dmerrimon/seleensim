CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL AMENDMENT  
SUMMARY OF CHANGES AND RATIONALE  
UX023-CL203 Amendment 1 
09 May 2016 
 
Protocol UX023-CL203 (dated 05 September 2014) has been modified by [CONTACT_11827] 1 to 
add self-administration of study drug; to add reflexive genetic testing to assess additional 
genes associated with phenotypes overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_459985] ; to clarify the procedures for radiographic and ECHO assessments; 
to clarify analysis of ECG data; to add lipase testing in all subjects; to add reflexive testing 
for amylase isoenzymes if serum amylase levels are elevated ; to remove the 3- minute stair 
climb test; to add pharmacokinetic assessments;  and to add additional study visits after 
Week 72, and to m ake other clarifications . The major protocol c hanges are summarized 
below: 
1. Drug Administration : Section 7.4.2 (Identity of Investigational Product( s)) has been 
updated to state that “At the discretion of the investigator and after proper training by [CONTACT_460011], the subject or a non- healthcare 
professional may administer KRN23 to the subject under the supervision of a home health nurse where local regulations permit and where logistically feasible. Subjects or caregivers will be instructed to follow the directions provided in the Instructions for Use.” 
Rationale:  The study will assess the feasibility an d safety of allowing subjects or 
non-healthcare professionals to administer KRN23 in the home setting. Instructions 
for Use, developed with input from XLH patients, will be used to guide parents and non-healthcare professionals through the injection process. Self -administration will 
only begin after Institutional Review Board approval of the Instructions for Use. 
2. Dose titration: Section 7.1 (Overall Study Design and Plan) has been updated to 
clarify that, if needed, dose titration either up or down will occur using the three doses of study drug being used in this study 0.3 mg/kg, 0.6 mg/kg, and 1.0 mg/kg. In addition, language has been added that the investigator and medical monitor will discuss the need for dose titration. 
Rationale:  These changes were made to clarify the procedures for dose titration if 
needed during the study. 
3. Reflexive genetic testing : Section 7.1 (Overall Study Design and Plan ) has been 
modified to add, “ If the Baseline result for PHEX mutation analysis is negative or 
inconclusive (i.e., No Mutation, Likely Benign, Variant of Uncertain Significance, or 
Possibly Pathogenic) and the subject provides informed consent, reflexive genetic 
Protocol Number: UX023 -CL203 
Amendment 1 
09 May 2016  
 
 Proprietary and Confidential Page 3 
testing will be performed to assess additional genes associated with phenotypes 
overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_459986].” 
Rationale : In subjects without a family history of XLH and with a clinical diagnosis 
of XLH based on phenotypic presentation, PHEX mutation analysis results may be 
negative or inconclusive. For any subject with a PHEX  mutation analysis result of No 
Mutation, Likely Benign, Variant of Uncertain Si gnificance, or Possibly Pathogenic, 
reflexive genetic testing will be performed to assess additional genes associated with 
clinical and biochemical phenotypes overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_459986]. In addition, Sanger sequencing for the functional 3’UTR variant in PHEX  will be performed.  
 
4. Study population.  Inclusion criterion #2 has been updated to state that subjects with 
a Screening estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 60 mL/min or 45 to 
<60 mL/min will be eligible with confirmation that the renal insufficiency is not due 
to nephrocalcinosis. Previously it stated that subjects with eGFR ≥ 60 mL/min were eligible. 
 
Rationale: Many older adults have an  eGFR in the range of 45 to <60 mL/min, which is 
considered a mild to moderate decrease in kidney function that is generally benign . 
Therefore, the inclusion criterion was expanded to include subjects with this lower eGFR 
range with confirmation that the reduced renal function is not due to nephrocalcinosis.  
5. Additional sites f or radiographic assessments.  Section [IP_ADDRESS].1 ( Bone Health 
Measurements ) has been updated to clarify the possible sites where standard 
radiographs will be obtained. 
 
Rationale : The original protocol specified that standard radiographs would be obtained at 
“the legs, feet and lateral spi[INVESTIGATOR_459987](s) where the subject is  
currently experiencing tenderness or pain that may reflect underlying pathology, or where the 
subject has a history of recent (<3 months) fracture .” The study reference manual that was 
developed after completion of the original protocol included additional details about possible sites for standard radiographs. For consistency, those changes have been implemented in this amendment as follows: “ Standard radiographs will be obtained of the chest, lateral spi[INVESTIGATOR_050], 
right and left hand/wrist, right and left humerus, right and left radius/ulna, right and left femur/pelvis, right and left tibia/fibula, and right and left foot as well as any location(s) where the subject is currently experiencing tenderness or pain that may reflect underlying pathology, or where the subject has a history of recent (<3 months) fracture, or in bones where radiographs suggest the presence of a fracture or pseudo-fracture.” 
 
6. Central reads of echocardiograms . Section [IP_ADDRESS] ( Echocardiogram ) has been 
updated to state that ECHOs will be read centrally rather than locally.  
 
Rationale : ECHOs were included in the UX023-CL203 study to assess two key 
parameters among other measures of cardiac structure and function: 1) ectopic mineralization in the heart valves and aorta; and 2) left ventricular hypertrophy. 
Protocol Number: UX023 -CL203 
Amendment [ADDRESS_587318] and routinely done at all 
centers, the assessment of the former is more challenging and subjective and therefore requires efforts to both standardize ECHO acquisition parameters and also the ECHO readers approach. Thus, the reading process for ECHOs has been centralized in this study in an effort to minimize inter -reader variability and improve the utility of the 
reads for their intended purpose in this study, particularly in the assessment of ectopic mineralization.  
7. Safety Anal yses: In Section [IP_ADDRESS], electrocardiogram (ECG) is now listed as a 
general safety assessment. Previously it was listed within the safety assessments for ectopic mineralization.  
Rationale:  ECG is performed to evalua te for changes associated with left ventricular 
hypertrophy. E ctopic mineralization is not expected to affect ECG parameters and 
ECG was inad vertently listed in that section in the original protocol.  Ectopic 
mineralization in the heart will be assessed by  [CONTACT_460012].  
8. Safety Testing: Section [IP_ADDRESS] (Clinical Laboratory Tests ) has been updated to add 
assessment of lipase in all subjects and specify additional laboratory analyses will be performed reflexively if serum amylase levels are elevated to ≥1.5 the upper limit of the reference range (ULRR).  
Rationale : Several organs including the pancreas and salivary gland produce amylase; 
thus, elevated amylase levels are not diagnostic in the absence of other information. In ongoing and completed KRN23 studies at baseline mild elevations of amylase (<2x ULRR) have been noted. Post- treatment mild shifts in amylase elevation 
(<2xULRR) have been noted without association with gastrointestinal symptoms. No adverse events of pancreatitis have been ob served. The testing for serum lipase and 
reflexive testing for amylase isoenzymes when serum amylase levels are elevated will allow a determination of whether the amylase elevations are from pancreatic or salivary gland sources.  
9. Removal of 3- Minute Stair C limb Test : Section [IP_ADDRESS].3 ( Clinical Outcomes 
Measurements ) has been updated to remove the 3- minute stair climb test.   
Rationale : This measurement  was removed from the study protocol in the Note to 
File dated [ADDRESS_587319].  
10. Addition of Pharmacokinetic A ssessments:  Section 7.5.2 has been added  with 
pre-dose pharmacokinetic (PK) assessments of KRN23 concentration. 
Rationale:  To assess KRN23 concentration and possible accumulation, serum 
pre-dose levels will be evaluated as a PK parameter in this study.   
Protocol Number: UX023 -CL203 
Amendment 1 
09 May 2016  
 
 Proprietary and Confidential Page 5 
11. Additional study visits after Week 72:  Changes have been made throughout the 
document, particularly in Table 2.1 and in Section 7 (Investigational Plan ), to add 
study visits after Wee k 72 until the new End-of- Treatment (EoT) visit at Week [ADDRESS_587320] 
dose of KRN23. Clinic visits will occur at Weeks 96, 120, and 144/EoT; s ubjects may 
be seen at home by [CONTACT_460013] . 
Rationale : The study will continue beyond the originally planned completion date. 
Addition of study visits beyond Week [ADDRESS_587321] dose corresponds to approximately 5 times the elimination half-life of KRN23.  
12.  Schedule of Events: A footnote has been added to Table 2.1 (Schedule of Events) to 
state that if there is a technical or operational issue obtaining results for HAHA, FGF23, or KRN23, then an additional blood sample may be obtained at the next suitable clinic visit.  
Rationale:  This change was made to clarify procedures and to align with other 
clinical study protocols in the KRN23 development program. 
13. Record Retention : Section 8.4.[ADDRESS_587322] 25 years after the end of the clinical trial or in accordance with national law.  
Rationale: This administrative change has been made to reflect changes to EU clinical trial regulations and current regulations by [CONTACT_11831].  
14. Safety Contact [CONTACT_7171]:  In Section 8.5.8, the safety contact [CONTACT_460014].  
Rationale:  Administrative change.

CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL AMENDMENT  
SUMMARY OF CHANGES AND RATIONALE  
UX023-CL203 Amendment 2  
23 June 2017 
 
Protocol UX023-CL203 Amendment 1 (dated 09 May 2016) has been modifi ed by 
[CONTACT_11827] [ADDRESS_587323] or their caregiver may occur without the supervision of a home health (HH) nurse after proper training and that HH visits may occur without the presence of a HH nurse. Therefore, the schedule of events was updated to require the presence of a home health (HH) nurse only for HH visits occurring every 12 weeks after week 96 of the initial extension period to continue assessments after subjects or their caregivers are trained to administer drug. Certain patient-reported outcome assessments will not be required through the extended treatment period. Endpoint descriptions were also updated for clarity. Minor edits and typographical corrections hav e also been made. Important protocol changes are summarized 
below: 
1. Study Drug Administration: Sections 7.4.[ADDRESS_587324]/caregiver administration have been added as well. Additional language regarding drug administration by [CONTACT_460015] n provided in Sections  7.4.1, 7.4.2,  and 7.4.3.  
Rationale : Currently, s ome subjects are self -administering or having their caregiver 
administer KRN23 in the home setting with HH nurse supervision. The requirement 
for HH nurse supervision of KRN23 a dministration by [CONTACT_460016]. Instructions for Use have been 
developed with input from healthy volunteers and patients with XLH. These 
instructions will be used to guide subjects and caregivers through the injection process. The Instructions for Use will be approved by [CONTACT_460017]/caregiver administration begins. 
2. Schedule of Events:  The Schedule of Events has been updated to have a HH nurse 
required only on HH visits occurring every 12 weeks after week 96 to ensure 
Protocol Number: UX023-CL203 
Amendment [ADDRESS_587325] or caregiver has been properly trained and instructed to handle and administer study drug. Assessments collected by [CONTACT_460018] 4 weeks will now be collected every 12 weeks at a HH visit or a clinic v isit. 
Language was added to clarify that subjects will not be required to complete two patient-reported outcomes – the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) and Short Form Health 
Survey (SF -36) – past Week 144. Additionally, language describing the visit window 
in the Schedule of Events was corrected to reflect all visits prior to the End of 
Treatment (EoT) visit. 
Rationale : Since supervision is no longer required in the event that drug is 
administered by [CONTACT_32596], assessments previously made by [CONTACT_460019], including pregnancy testing and vital signs, will no longer be collected during 
every HH visit. However, a HH nurse must be present at HH visits occurring every [ADDRESS_587326] Week 144. Extending the visits from 25 to 43 was 
intended to be made in the Protocol Amendment 1. The additional visits and visit windows were noted in the Protocol Amendment 1, Section 7.5 Study Procedures and Assessments, page 40, but not included in the Schedule of Events footnote section.  
3. Study Duration: In Sections  7.1 and 7.4.3 and other relevant sections, the study has 
been extended to include up to approximately 40 weeks of additional KRN23 treatment, until 30 September 2018. (The duration of this extension will vary for 
individual subjects depending on when study treatment was initiated through 30 September 2018.) In addition, in these sections, the Safety Follow-up telephone call (TC) that occurs over an interval of up to 8 weeks (+5 days) following the EoT or Early Termination Visit has been updated. An initial Safety Follow -up TC will occur  
4 weeks (+ 5 days) after the EoT Visit to collect information on whether KRN23 
treatment has been started through another mechanism and, if not, any ongoing or new AEs, serious adverse events (SAEs), or concomitant medications. If the subject is not continuing KRN23 therapy under commercial use or another mechanism at that time, then site personnel will initiate a subsequent Safety Follow -up TC at 8 weeks 
(+ 5 days) after the EoT Visit to collect information on whether KRN23 treatment has 
been started through another mechanism and, if not, any ongoing or new AEs, SAEs, or concomitant medications . The maximum study duration has consequently been 
changed to up to approximately 192 weeks, with up to 184 (+5 days) weeks of treatment . The end of study is defined as the last day that protocol- specified 
assessments (including telephone contact) are conducted for the last subject in the study. 
Rationale : An additional Treatment Extension of up to [ADDRESS_587327] been 
Protocol Number: UX023-CL203 
Amendment [ADDRESS_587328] information as  appropriate on ongoing 
or new AEs , SAEs, and concomitant medications after subjects discontinue study 
drug but before KRN23 treatment under commercial use or another mechanism 
begins. 
4. Pregnancy Testing and Contraception: In Section [IP_ADDRESS], the list of examples of 
highly effective contraception methods was updated and text was updated to further specify potential risks regarding pregnancy.  
Rationale : This change was made to align with the Clinical Trial Facilitation Group 
(CTFG) guideline, “Recommendations related to contraception and pregnancy testing in clinical trials.”  
5. Coordinating Investigator: [CONTACT_8985]  8.2 was updated to include the following text 
“A Coordinating Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_459988]. The Coordinating 
Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_459989], thorough 
knowledge of the therapeutic area being studied, and the ability to interpret data. The Coordinating Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_11817].”  
Rationale : Regulatory gu idance in the EU requires selection of a Coordinating 
Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_8178] a multi-center clinical trial.  
6. Anti-KRN23 Antibodies: In Sections  5.3, 6, [IP_ADDRESS], and the Schedule of Events, the 
term HAHA (human anti -human antibody) in reference to anti-KRN23 antibody 
testing, has been replaced with the term ADA (anti -drug antibody).  
Rationale : This change is a clarification. The immunogenicity of KRN23 is evaluated 
by [CONTACT_460020]-drug antibodies (ADA), independent of isotype, in human 
serum. While the study protocol previously used the term “HAHA” for this assessment, it has been replaced with the more correct and specific term, ADA.  
7. Physical Examination : Section [IP_ADDRESS] was updated to include “The genitourinary 
exam scope should be non-invasive and as per age- appropriate standard of care, at the 
investigator’s discretion  based on clinical judgement and/or safety need. If the PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_435042] a genitourinary exam, it is not necessary to perform.”   
Rationale : Language was added to section  [IP_ADDRESS] to clarify the scope and necessity of 
a genitourinary exam.  
8. Safety Language : Sections  5.[ADDRESS_587329] been updated to summarize the safety of 
KRN23 from completed and ongoing clinical trials.   Rationale : Language updates regardin g safety were based on findings from ongoing 
and completed clinical trials examining the efficacy and safety of KRN23.  
Protocol Number: UX023-CL203

 Proprietary and Confidential Page 5 
9. Number of Subjects : Sections 7.1, 7.3, and 7.6.[ADDRESS_587330] the 
final number of subjects enrolled in the study.   
Rationale : Safety and efficacy data is only being assessed for 20 enrolled subjects .  
10. Endpoints : In Section 7.6.1, endpoint descriptions were updated for clarity. 
Section [IP_ADDRESS] was updated to further specify that the PD analysis set consists of 
subjects that also have evaluable serum data and the term “Intent to Treat analysis 
set” was replaced with “efficacy analysis set.” Additionally, the change from baseline in fractional excretion of phosphorus (FEP) was added as a pharmacodynamic endpoint. The exploratory endpoints in Section 7.6.1 hav e also been updated to 
include the long-term assessment of the pharmacokinetics of KRN23, which was previously only included as an exploratory endpoint in the synopsis. The exploratory endpoint of healing of pre-existing pseudofractures and/or Looser zones, as defined by [CONTACT_460021]: the number of active pseudofractures and/or fractures as defined by [CONTACT_460022]/fractures that were healed, partially healed, unchanged, and worsened at post- baseline visits . 
Rationale : The section was updated to clarify current and additional endpoints 
planned for analysis in this study. Assessment of KRN23 concentrations was listed as an exploratory endpoint in the synopsis and is now included in Section 7.6.1.

Up to 5 sites in the [LOCATION_002] (US)  
PHASE OF DEVELOPMENT:  
Phase 2b long-term extension study 
RATIONALE FOR THIS STUDY:  
X-linked hypophosphatemia (XLH) is a disorder of renal phosphate wasting caused by [CONTACT_460023] 23 (FGF23) that impairs normal phosphate reabsorption in the 
kidney. Hypophosphatemia and low-normal circulating 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D (1,25[OH]
2D) levels 
are typi[INVESTIGATOR_459990]. Adults with XLH typi[INVESTIGATOR_459991], osteoarthritis, joint pain and stiffness, bone pain, gait abnormalities, and/or dental abscesses; bowing of the lower 
extremities and short stature remain from childhood. Although treatment with oral phosphate and 
vitamin D metabolites typi[INVESTIGATOR_459992], many adults experi ence long- term complications 
from the treatment, such as hyperparathyroidism and nephrocalcinosis. Physicians may consider 
treating adults with oral phosphate and/or vitamin D metabolites in select cases where an adult has 
chronic non- traumatic fractures, pending orthopedic surgery, severe osteomalacia, or disabling skeletal 
pain. More efficacious, safer, and convenient therapi[INVESTIGATOR_459993].  
KRN23 is a recombinant fully human monoclona l IgG

established the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of KRN23. A Phase 1/2 study (KRN- INT-001) and an 
associated extension study (KRN -INT-002) evaluated the PK and pharmacodynamics (PD) of KRN23 
on phosphate metabolism and assessed phosphate homeostasis and mineral metabolism. The safety 
data from these studies suggest that KRN23 in single and repeated monthly doses up to 1.0 mg/kg for 
as many as 16 doses over a period of 17 months has a favorable safety profile in adult subjects with XLH.

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY:  
Summary : 
This study is a Phase 2b, open-label, long-term extension of study KRN23- INT-001/KRN23- INT-[ADDRESS_587333] of approximately 25  eligible subjects 
who participated in Kyowa Hakko Kirin Pharma, Inc.’s (KHK’s) study KRN23- INT-001 or 
KRN23-INT-002 (received at least 2 doses of KRN23). Subjects who were discontinued from 
KRN23-INT-001 or KRN23- INT-002 due to a treatment -emergent adverse event (TEAE) classified as 
possibly or probably related to treatment may be eligible for participation in this study based on the 
clinical judgment of the investigator with agreement from the sponsor. Study treatment will continue   
over a maximum of 1 84 weeks (+5 days) to assess long -term safety, immunogenicity, PD response, 
and efficacy of KRN23 
The Screening Visit will include a full medical history, blood tests, urine collections (of 2- and 
24-hour duration), and urinal ysis to confirm eligibility. A renal ultrasound will also be taken at 
Screening. A physical examination, assessments of walking ability, balance, and agility; self -reported 
pain and disability; and quality of life will be done at Baseline. Fasting blood sa mples and baseline 
imaging and functional testing will be obtained prior to the initial dose.  
Subjects will receive the initial SC injection of KRN23 at the clinic. Starting doses will be individual 
for each subject, i.e., the subject’s last dose in study KRN23-INT-001 or KRN23- INT-002, either 0.3, 
0.6, or 1.0 mg/kg. Up to Week 12, individual subjects who have not reached serum phosphorus levels above the lower limit of normal (LLN; 2.5 mg/dL) at the end of the dose interval may have their doses 
titrated upward every 4 weeks to a maximum dose of 1.0 mg/kg based on fasting trough serum 
phosphorus levels. Doses may be titrated downward if at any point the serum phosphorus level 
increases above the upper limit of normal (ULN; 4.5 mg/dL). KRN23 will be administered monthly 
(every 4 weeks), either at home or in the clinic. Subjects will return to the clinic monthly at Weeks 4, 
8, and 12; then every 12 weeks at Weeks 24, 36, and 48 ; and then every 24 weeks at weeks 72, 96, 
120, 144 and as applicable up until the End-of- Treatment (EoT) Visit, which will occur by 
30 September 2018. Subjects may be seen at home by [CONTACT_460026] (HH) personnel between the clinic visits, or the HH visits may be completed in the clinic, depending on the proximity of the subjects to the investigational site and the location and availability of HH resources. After proper training, 
subjects may self -administer KRN23 or be administered KRN23 by [CONTACT_460027]; in such cases, the HH visit would become a telephone visit.  
Safety, immunogenicity, PK, PD, and efficacy assessments will be performed during the treatment period as outlined in the Schedule of Events. All assessments, with the exception of weight, will be repeated at the EoT Visit. Subjects may choose to withdraw from the study at any time. 
NUMBER OF SUBJECTS PLANNED :

4. Pregnant or breastfeeding at Screening or planning to become pregnant (self or partner) at any 
time during the study. 
5. Participation in an investigational drug or device trial within 30 days of enrollment (other than 
KRN23-INT-001 or KRN23- INT-002). 
6. Presence or history of any hypersensitivity to KRN23 excipi[INVESTIGATOR_11792], in the judgment of the investigator, places the subject at increased risk for adverse effects.  
7. Use of a pharmacologic vitamin D metabolite or analog (e.g., calcitriol, doxercalciferol, and paricalcitol), phosphate, or aluminum hydroxide antacids (e.g., Maalox® and Myla nta®) within 
21 days prior to Screening or during the study. 
8. Use of medication to suppress PTH (e.g., Sensipar®, cinacalcet, calcimimetics) within [ADDRESS_587336](S), DOSE AND MODE OF ADMINISTRATION:  
KRN23 is a sterile, clear, colorless, and preservative-free solution in single- use 5-mL vials containing 
1 mL of KRN23 at a concentration of 10 mg/mL or 30 mg/mL. KRN23 will be administered SC 
without dilution. Subjects will receive study drug via SC injection to the abdomen, upper arms, and 
thighs; the injection site will be rotated  for each visit,  with the option to includ e a different quadrant of 
the abdomen. No more than 1.[ADDRESS_587337] be different for each administration, but may be in the same general 
location (eg arm, thigh). After proper training by [CONTACT_460028], the subject 
may self-administer KRN23 or the subject’s caregiver may self- administer KRN23 to the subject 
without supervision of a home health nurse. Starting doses will be individual for each subject, i.e., the 
Protocol Number: UX023-CL203 
Amendment [ADDRESS_587338]’s last dose in stud y KRN23 -INT-001 or KRN23 -INT-002 (0.3, 0.6, or 1.0 mg/kg). Up to 
Week 12, individual subjects who have not reached serum phosphorus levels above the LLN 
(2.5 mg/dL) at the end of the dose interval may have their doses titrated every 4 weeks (i.e., from 0.3  
to 0.6 mg/kg or from 0.6 to 1.0 mg/kg) to a maximum dose of 1.0 mg/kg based on fasting trough 
serum phosphorus levels. Doses may be titrated downward (i.e., from 1.0 to 0.6 mg/kg or from 0.6 to 0.3 mg/kg) if at any point serum phosphorus increases above the ULN (4.5 mg/dL). The investigator 
will discuss with the medical monitor the need for dose titration.  
REFERENCE THERAPY(IES), DOSE AND MODE OF ADMINISTRATION :  
The study design is open- label; all subjects will receive investigational product. No placebo  or 
reference therapy will be administered in this study. 
DURATION OF TREATMENT :  
The treatment  duration will be a maximum of 184weeks (+ 5 days) with a maximum total of 46 doses 
administered. 
CRITERIA FOR EVALUATION:  
Safety and Immunogenicity: 
Safety assessments will be summarized at Baseline and at each observed time that they are collected .

agility, and dynamic balance  
STATISTICAL METHODS :  
Safety Analysis:  
All subjects who receive any amount of study drug will be included in the safety analysis. 
All AEs will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). 
The incidence and frequency of AEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_1196] (SOC), Preferred 
Term (PT), severity, and relationship to KRN23 treatment. A by-subject listing will be provided for 
those subjects who experience an SAE, including death, or who exper ience an AE associated with 
early withdrawal from the study or from study drug treatment. 
Protocol Number: UX023-CL203

5 INTRODUCTION 
5.1 Overview of the Disease 
5.1.1 X-linked Hypophosphatemia  
X-linked hypophosphatemia (XLH) is a rare genetic metabolic disorder and the most 
common inherited form of rickets. XLH was originally called vitamin D- resistant rickets, 
because doses of vitamin D, usually effective for the treatment of vitamin D -deficient 
nutritional rickets, did not have an impact on phosphate levels in these patients ( Albright et 
al. 1937); (Baroncelli et al. 2012) . The incidence of XLH is 3.9 to 5 per 100,000 live births 
(Davies et al. 1981) ; (Beck-Nielsen et al. 2009) . XLH is also the most common inherited 
defect in renal tubular phosphate transport; it is characterized by [CONTACT_460033] 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25[OH]
2D), an inappropriate response to hypophosphatemia ( Holm et al. 2012) . In XLH 
patients, high levels of fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) reduce normal phosphate reabsorption in the kidney and cause a phosphate-wasting condition, which is the major manifestation of XLH (Imel et al. 2005) ; (Liu et al. 2007) . 
XLH is transmitted as a n X-linked dominant disorder, although autosomal recessive and 
dominant forms of hypophosphatemia have also been observed ( Dixon et al. 1998) . 
Mutations resulting in the loss of function of the Phosphate- regulating gene with Homology 
to Endopeptidases located on the X chromosome (PHEX) form the genetic basis for XLH (Carpenter et al. 2011) ; PHEX is the only gene in which mutations are known to cause XLH; 
however, because of the great intrafamilial variation, severity cannot be predicted (Ruppe 
2012). Approximately 20% of PHEX mutations are de novo (i.e., not inherited from a parent) 
based on genetic testing and clinical observat ions in non- familial XLH patients (Dixon et al. 
1998); (Whyte et al. 1996) . The phenotypic spectrum of Xlinked- hypophosphatemia (XLH) 
ranges from isolated hypophosphatemia to severe lower extremity bowing.  
Skeletal abnormalities of osteomalacia (rickets) often manifest in the first 2 years of 
childhood (e.g., bowed legs) when lower extremity bowing becomes evident with the onset of weight bearing; however, the disorder may go undiagnosed until adulthood. The initial presenting complaint in adults may be enthesopathy (calcification of the tendons, ligaments, 
and joint capsules) ( Ruppe 2012) . There is a great deal of variability in the manifestations of 
XLH. In the mildest cases, only hypophosphatemia is evident ( Holm et al. 2012) . In more 
severe cases, adult pat ients with XLH may suffer from bone pain and osteomalacia; 
increased  risk of bone fractures; joint abnormalities and joint pain; osteoarthritis, and 
enthesopathy ( Ruppe 2012) ; (Tenenhouse et al. 2001) ; (Reid et al. 1989) . Diagnostic testing 
characteristically reveals low serum phosphate concentration and reduced tubular  resorption 
of phosphate corrected for glomerular filtration rate (TmP/GFR). Additionally in adults, the normal physiologic response to hypophosphatemia of an elevation of 1,25(OH)
2D is absent; 
serum calcium and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) are within the normal range; and parathyroid hormone (PTH) is normal to slightly elevated. ( Ruppe 2012)  For definitive evidence of renal 
phosphate wasting, a 2- hour fasting urine specimen as well as a blood sample collected at the

midpoint of the urine collection period are used to calculate the percent tubular reabsorption 
of phosphate (TRP) and to determine the tubular threshold maximum for phosphate (Carpenter et al. 2011). 
Treatments for XLH to date have been directed at replacing lost phosphorus and correcting  osteomalacia by [CONTACT_460034] D 
metabolite (e.g., calcitriol). Adult patients with XLH are often not tr eated with standard of 
care because of the risk of hyperparathyroidism and nephrocalcinosis and other side effects (i.e., hyperphosphatemia, hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, nephrocalcinosis, hypoparathyroidism, and secondary hyperparathyroidism) and the lack of evidence that such therapy improves long- term skeletal complications of XLH. Physicians may consider oral 
phosphate and/or active vitamin D treatment if adult patients suffer from chronic non-traumatic fractures, pending orthopedic surgery, severe osteomalacia, or disabling skeletal pain/stiffness, and treatment requires frequent monitoring of urine and serum chemistries. Routine lower extremity x -rays and annual renal ultrasound examinations are typi[INVESTIGATOR_459998] ( Ruppe 2012) . However, these replacement therapi[INVESTIGATOR_459999] - namely, excess FGF23 (Carpenter et al. 2011) . 
5.1.[ADDRESS_587365] mechanisms by [CONTACT_460035]23 overexpression are not 
fully understood ( Rowe 2012) . Through a series of complex steps, the defect in PHEX leads 
to an erroneous signal that phosphate levels are high, In response, the osteocytes inappropriately secrete high levels of FGF23 that lead to phosphate wasting in the urine, severe hypophosphatemia and the bone deformities associated with rickets ( Rowe 2012) ; 
(Gattineni et al. 2012) ; (Baroncelli et al. 2012 ). FGF23 is composed of [ADDRESS_587366]. FGF23 principally acts on the kidneys to 
increase phosphate urinary excretion and suppress 1,25(OH)
2D synthesis. Also, FGF23 has a 
direct effect on the parathyroid glands to decrease PTH formation and secretion. The main mechanism by [CONTACT_460036]23 reduces serum phosphorus is through inhibition of renal proximal tubular phosphate reabsorption via down-regulation of type IIa and type IIc sodium-phosphate (NaPi[INVESTIGATOR_460000]) co-transporters in the renal proximal tubule. (Razzaque et al. 2007) ; (Fukumoto 2008)  FGF23 also decreases serum 1,25(OH)
2D levels by 
[CONTACT_61670] 25- hydroxy vitamin D -1-alpha-hydroxylase activity and by [CONTACT_30212] 25- hydroxy 
vitamin D 24 -hydroxylase activity in the kidney. These actions by [CONTACT_9266]23 lead to increased 
urinary phosphate excretion and decreased intestinal phosphate absorption and result in hypophosphatemia; FGF23 thus has a key adaptive role in maintaining normal serum phosphate levels ( Fukumoto 2008) ; (Juppner 2011) . 
FGF23 signaling in the kidney is dependent on the presence of fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) and the obligate co -receptor Klotho, a transmembrane protein required 
for signaling (Urakawa et al. 2006) . FGF23 binds to the FGFR1 and Klotho co-receptor, with 
both binding events needed for signaling. 
Protocol Number: UX023-CL203 
Amendment [ADDRESS_587367]  
KRN23 is a recombinant human IgG
1 monoclonal antibody that binds to and inhibits the 
activity of FGF23. KRN23 is expressed in Chinese hamster ovary dihydrofolate reductase 
deficient cells. The secreted KRN23 antibody is recovered from the culture medium and purified using a series of chromatographic and filtration steps. Based on the amino acid sequence, the predicted molecular mass of KRN23 is approximately 140 kilodaltons (kDa). Nonclinical studies demonstrated KRN23 possesses high binding affinity to the Nterminal- domain of FGF23. KRN23 binds to FGF23 from humans, cynomolgus monkeys and rabbits, but not to other species tested. 
5.2.2 Mechanism of Action in XLH  
KRN23 has the potential to block or reduce FGF23 action and improve phosphate 
metabolism in XLH patients. KRN23 binds the amino- terminal domain of FGF23 that 
interacts with the FGFR1 -binding portion of the combination FGFR1/Klotho receptor, 
preventing FGF23 from binding and signaling its receptor. Both intact and fragmented FGF23 polypeptides are immunoprecipi[INVESTIGATOR_460001]23 ( Yamazaki et al. 2008 ). 
By [CONTACT_35688]23, KRN23 restores tubular reabsorption of phosphate (TmP/GFR) from 
the kidney and increases the production of 1,25(OH)
2D that also enhances intestinal 
absorption of phosphate. The dual action on kidney reabsorption and intestinal absorption, improves serum phosphorus levels, which is expected to improve bone mineralization and reduce the diverse bone and non-bone manifestations associated with hypophosphatemi a in 
XLH patients.  
5.2.3 Nonclinical Studies  
The results of initial in vitro studies established that KRN23 bound with similar high affinity 
to human, rabbit, and cynomolgus monkey FGF23 and that this binding was associated with inhibition of receptor- mediated s ignal transduction, defining a putative mode of action for 
this human anti-FGF23 mAb. These results further established that rabbit and cynomolgus monkey were pharmacologically relevant animal models for the investigation of the pharmacodynamics (PD) and t oxicologic properties of KRN23.  
In vivo studies in rabbits and adult and juvenile cynomolgus monkeys demonstrated 
dosedependent- elevations of serum phosphorus and 1,25(OH)
2D, confirming the 
pharmacologic actions of KRN23 in these species. While these stu dies confirmed the 
predicted mode of action and pharmacological actions in rabbits and cynomolgus monkeys, they did not provide evidence of reversal of disease-associated changes. To provide the proof of concept that an anti-FGF23 mAb could reverse the cha racteristic disease -associated effects

Amendment 2 29 September  2017 
 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  Page 32 
seen in XLH, the actions of an anti-FGF23 mAb in the Hyp mouse model for XLH were 
investigated. Experiments in both juvenile and adult Hyp mice provided evidence that blocking the FGF23 receptor with an anti- FGF23 mAb  normalized or ameliorated many of 
the characteristic abnormalities associated with this disease (e.g., growth, muscle strength, and pain) in the Hyp mouse. 
The major toxicological findings of KRN23, such as mineralization, were related to an 
excessive pharmacological effect (excessive elevation of serum phosphorus above the normal ranges). Except for the pharmacologically -related toxicities, there were no unexpected severe 
toxicities. In addition, no gross and histopathological abnormalities were observed at the intravenous (IV) infusion sites or subcutaneous (SC) injection sites in the 40- week 
repeatdose- toxicity studies in adult cynomolgus monkeys.  
5.2.[ADDRESS_587368] been completed  in adult patients with XLH: a single dose Phase 1 
safety and tolerability study of KRN23 (KRN23- US-02), a single dose Phase 1 safety and 
tolerability study of KRN23 in Japan and Korea (KRN23-001), a repeat dose Phase 1/2 dose escalation study (KRN23 -INT-001), and associated treatment extension study (K RN23-INT-
002). Additional studies in adult and pediatric XLH patients are ongoing. Details of study parameters and current PK, PD, clinical efficacy and safety results are provided in the IB.  
Data from clinical studies to date are consistent with the propo sed mechanism of action: that 
KRN23 blocks FGF23 action, leading to a sustained increase in serum phosphorus levels due to increased tubular reabsorption of phosphate (TmP/GFR) and increased intestinal absorption caused by [CONTACT_67191] 1,25(OH)
2D. Single and repeat -dose clinical studies indicate 
SC administration of KRN23 consistently increased and sustained serum phosphorus levels and TmP/GFR, without a major impact on urine calcium levels or vitamin D metabolism. The data from the long- term extension study s uggest KRN23 could provide sustained 
increases in serum phosphorus levels sufficiently such that improvements in bone physiology, structure and function would be expected. 
Repeated doses of KRN23 up to 1.0 mg/kg were well tolerated by [CONTACT_460037] 1/[ADDRESS_587369] been associated with KRN23

5.3 Summary of Overall Risks and Potential Benefits 
KRN23, a fully human mAb that binds and inhibits FGF23, is being developed as a potential 
therapeutic candidate for XLH, a rare genetic disease associated with hypophosphatemia and elevated levels of FGF23. By [CONTACT_460038]23, KRN23 has the potential to restore phosphate, vitamin D, and bone metabolism homeostas is in patients with XLH, 
thereby [CONTACT_460039], the pathologic hallmark of XLH in adults. This therapeutic approach directly targets the inherent dysregulation in XLH (ie, excess FGF23). In contrast, 
supplementation therapy with phosphate and/or 1,25(OH)
2D, is only partially effective and 
may increase the risk of ectopic mineralization, particularly nephrocalcinosis . 
Clinical studies to date have demonstrated that KRN23 treatment blocks FGF23 action and leads to a sustained increase in serum phosphorus levels due to increased TmP/GFR. Increased 1,25(OH)
2D was also observed, as expected, based on the inhibition of the excess 
of FGF23. Bone formation and resorption markers also increased. KRN23 was well tolerated in the population studied. No major safety concerns were observed; there was no evidence of immunogenicity, and no evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) based on echocardiogram (ECHO) or electrocardiogram (ECG) even though FGF23 levels were increased following KRN23 treatment. Although ectopic mineralization is a known risk related to XLH disease and is exacerbated by [CONTACT_35692]/or 1,25(OH)
2D supplementation, KRN23 does not appear to be associated 
with progression of cardiac or renal ectopic mineralization beyond the natural course of pre-existing disease.  
SC doses of KRN23 in the range from 0.3 to 1.0 mg/kg were able to achieve the desired PD effect in adults, which lasted approximately one month, positioning KRN23 as a drug tha t 
could be administered every [ADDRESS_587370] of these factors on the quality of life of adult patients with XLH. To date, KRN23 has a favorable safety profile without evidence of increased ectopic mineralization or other concerns associated with the excess of FGF23. KRN23 has the potential to be an effective and safe treatment option for patients with XLH.  
5.4 Study Rationale 
Ultragenyx is evaluating the therapeutic potential of KRN23, a recombinant human IgG1 mAb targeting FGF23 in adult patients with XLH. Many adults who received treatment with oral phosphate and vitamin D metabolites experience long -term complications from the 
treatment, such as hyperparathyroidism and nephrocalcinosis. Physicians may consider treating adult patients with oral phosphate and/or vitamin D metabolites in select cases where

an adult has chronic non- traumatic fractures, pending orthopedic surgery, severe 
osteomalacia, or disabling skeletal pain. More efficacious, safer, and more convenient 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_460002] -related 
complications.  
The safety dat a from the completed Phase 1 and Phase 1/[ADDRESS_587371] that KRN23 in

longterm- administration of KRN23. The scientific rationale, unmet medical needs, and results of nonclinical studies support the proposition that KRN23 has the potential to offe r an 
important new therapeutic option to this patient population.

Amendment [ADDRESS_587373] of approximately 2 0 eligible subjects who participated in KHK’s study 
KRN23-INT-001 or study KRN23- INT-002 (received at least 2 doses of KRN23). 
Subjects who were discontinued from KRN23- INT-[ADDRESS_587374] 21 days prior to the Screening Visit, will discontinue use of any medication to suppress PTH within 2  months prior to the Screening Visit, and may not resume any of those 
medications for the duration of the study. Subjects will be brought in for a Screening Visit and asked to provide written informed consent (Section 8.1.3) . The Screening Visit will 
include full medical history and demographic assessments, clinical laboratory testing (blood and urine), a renal ultrasound, and review of all inclusion and exclusion criteria to confirm eligibility.  
After eligibility is confirmed, Baseline assessments can occur within 1 day and up to 7 days of the Screening Visit and the tests may be spread out over 2 days. Baseline assessments will include a PHEX mutation  analysis for genotype/phenotype correlations, clinical laboratory 
testing (blood and urine), a physical examination, height and weight, functional and PRO assessments, ECHO and ECG, and Baseline imaging (X- rays). If the Baseline result for 
PHEX mutation a nalysis is negative or inconclusive (i.e., No Mutation, Likely Benign, 
Variant of Uncertain Significance, or Possibly Pathogenic) and the subject provides informed consent, reflexive genetic testing will be performed to assess additional genes associated w ith 
phenotypes overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_459986]. 
Any of the baseline tests may be performed at the Screening Visit. The baseline physical 
examination and PRO assessments may be performed at the Screening Visit as long as the PRO assessments are completed prior to the physical examination and on the same day. 
After all Screening and Baseline assessments have been completed, study drug administration will begin at Baseline (Week 0), with open -label, SC injection of undiluted 
KRN23.  
The starting dose of KRN23 at Baseline (Week 0) in this study will be individual for each 
subject, i.e., the same as a subject’s last dose in studies KRN23- INT-001 or KRN23- INT-002

(0.30, 0.60, or 1.0 mg/kg). Dosing will occur at the clinic and the volume will be based on 
the weight obtained on Day 0.  
Up to Week 12, individual subjects who have not reached serum phosphorus levels above the 
lower limit of normal (LLN; 2.5 mg/dL) at the end of the dose interval may have their doses titrated upward every 4 weeks (i.e., from 0.3 to 0.6 mg/kg or from 0.6 to 1.0 mg/kg) to a maximum dose of 1.0 mg/kg based on fasting trough serum phosphorus levels. Doses may be titrated downward (i.e., from 1.0 to 0.6 mg/kg or from 0.6 to 0.3 mg/kg) if at any point the serum phosphorus level increases above the upper limit of normal (ULN; 4.5 mg/dL). The investigator will discuss with the medical monitor the need for dose titration. KRN23 
injections will be repeated every 4  weeks for the duration of the study (from Week 0 until the 
visit prior to EoT Visit, which will occur prior to  30 September 2018), and weight will be 
reassessed periodically for dose volume adjustments as needed (Table 2.1 and Table 2.2). 
The End-of-Treatment (EoT) Visit will be the subject’s last visit occurring by 30 September 
2018. . A Safety Follow-up TC will occur 4 weeks (+ 5 days) after the EoT Visit to collect 
information on whether KRN23 treatment has been started through another mechanism and, if not, any ongoing or new AEs, serious adverse events (SAEs), or concomitant medications. If the subject is not continuing KRN23 therapy under commercial use or another mechanism 
at that time, then site personnel will initiate a subsequent Safety Follow -up TC at 8 weeks 
(+ 5 days) after the EoT Visit to collect information on whether KRN23 treatment has been 
started through another mechanism and, if not, any ongoing or new AEs, SAEs, or concomitant medications. The end of the study is defined as the last day that protocol-specified assessments are conducted for the last subject.  
Safety, immunogen icity, PD, and efficacy assessments will be performed throughout the 
study, as outlined in Table 2.1 and Table 2.2. Subjects may choose to withdraw from the 
study at any time.  
7.2 Discussion of Study Design, Including Choice of Control Group 
This is an open- label study with the primary objectives of furth er characterizing the 
longterm- safety, immunogenicity, PK, PD, and efficacy profile of SC dosing of KRN23 every 4 weeks in adults with XLH. Efficacy assessments are included only as exploratory 
objectives; therefore, no control group is included. In a single -dose pharmacokinetic (PK) 
study of KRN23 administered SC, the time of maximum concentration (t
max) of KRN23 in 
serum ranged from 192 to 272 hours (8 to 11 days) after a single dose. KRN23 was eliminated with a half -life (t
1/2) of 322 to 448 hours (13 to 19 days). Exposure to KRN23 
increased in a dose proportional manner up to 1.0 mg/kg following SC administration. Similar results in multiple -dose PK studies indicated that absorption of KRN23 following SC 
administration was consistent using a 4 -week dosing schedule.  
The design, dose, and dosing frequency of KRN23 in this open- label study were selected 
based on nonclinical data and data from completed clinical studies in which repeated doses of KRN23 up to 1.0 mg/kg were well tolerated by [CONTACT_460041] a 48- week treatment 
period. The safety events to date have been mild to moderate in general, and only one drug-

Amendment [ADDRESS_587375] participated in KHK’s study KRN23 -INT-001 or study 
KRN23-INT-002 (received at least 2 doses of KRN23) to be eligible for this long- term (up to 
192 week s) extension study. Given the known safety profile of KRN23 to date, the 
inclusion/exclusion criteria are designed to exclude subjects with known kidney dysfunction 
(i.e., an eGFR <45 mL/min or nephrocalcinosis serious enough to preclude study participation ), and subjects will be monitored throughout the study for changes in phosphate 
homeostasis and other relevant renal biochemistry parameters. Subjects who were reported to have safety -related events in KRN23 -INT-001 or KRN23- INT-002 that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_268667], preclude resuming KRN23 treatment will also be excluded. Subjects will be carefully monitored for other possible risks during the study (i.e., immunogenicity and injection site reactions, ectopic mineralization, renal failure  secondary 
to nephrocalcinosis, and pregnancy). Also, since elevated free FGF23 has been associated with LVH in patients with advanced kidney disease, ECHOs and ECGs are included to mitigate that risk.  
7.3 Selection of Study Population 
The study will be conducted in approximately 20 male and female adult subjects who 
are ≥18 years of age with a diagnosis of XLH and who participated in KHK’s study KRN23-INT-001 or study KRN23- INT-002 (received at least 2 doses of KRN23). 
The inclusion criteria are structured to  enroll subjects with similar biochemical and clinical 
characteristics, including eGFR ≥60 mL/min or 45 to <60 mL/min at Screening with 
confirmation that the renal insufficiency is not due to nephrocalcinosis. Sites throughout the [LOCATION_002] (US) will be participating in this study.  
7.3.[ADDRESS_587376] meet all of the following criteria at Screening:  
1. Have participated in KHK’s KRN23- INT-001 or KRN23- INT-002 studies (received at

2. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 60 mL/min (using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epi[INVESTIGATOR_10444] [CKD -EPI] equation) or eGFR of 45 to 
<60 mL/min at Screening with confirmation that the renal insufficiency is not due to 
nephrocalcinosis. 
3. Females of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test at Screening and be willing to have additional pregnancy tests during the study. Females considered not of childbearing potential include those who have been in menopause for at least tw o years,

5. Participation in an investigational drug or device trial within 30 days of enrollment (other than KRN23- INT-001 or KRN23- INT-002). 
6. Presence or history of any hypersensitivity to KRN23 excipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] (see Section  7.4.2) that, 
in the judgment of the investigator, places the subject at increased risk for adverse effects.

Subjects may be removed from the study for the following reasons: 
• Occurrence of an unacceptable adverse event (AE)  
• An illness that, in the judgment of the investigator or Ultragenyx, might place the subject 
at risk or invalidate the study 
• At the request of the subject, investigator, or Ultragenyx, for administrative or ot her 
reasons 
• Protocol deviation or noncompliance 
If the reason for removal of a subject from the study is an AE, the AE and any related test 
or procedure results will be recorded in the source documents and transcribed onto the electronic Case Report Form ( eCRF). AEs should be followed until the abnormality 
stabilizes, resolves, or until a decision is made that it is not likely to resolve. If AEs of abnormal clinical laboratory test results do not return to Baseline within [ADDRESS_587381] discontinues from the study prematurely, every reasonable effort should be made to perform the EoT Visit p rocedures within four weeks of discontinuation. If the subjects will 
be continuing KRN23 treatment under commercial use or another mechanism, all EoT assessments should be performed before beginning that treatment. For subjects not immediately continuing K RN23 treatment under commercial use or another mechanism, a 
Safety Follow -up TC will occur 4 weeks (+ 5 days) after the EoT visit to collect information 
on whether KRN23 treatment has been started through another mechanism and, if not, any ongoing or new AEs, SAEs, or concomitant medications. If the subject is not continuing KRN23 therapy under commercial use or another mechanism at that time, then site personnel will initiate a subsequent Safety Follow -up TC 8 weeks (+ 5 days) after the ET Visit to 
collect information on whether KRN23 treatment has been started through another 
mechanism and, if not, any ongoing or new AEs, SAEs, or concomitant medications.

7.4 Treatments  
7.4.1 Treatments Administered  
The study design is open- label and all subjects will receive KRN23; no placebo or reference 
therapy will be administered in this study. All subjects will receive SC injections of KRN23 
every 4 weeks, from Week 0 until the visit prior to the EoT Visit, which will occur prior to the end of September 2018, when KRN23 is expected to be commercially available in the 
US. Dose levels to be administered are described in Section  7.1. 
KRN23 will be administered SC without dilution. Subjects will receive study drug via SC 
injection to the abdomen, upper arms, and thighs; the injection site will be rotated for each visit, with  the option to include  a different quadrant of the abdomen. No more than 1.[ADDRESS_587383] be different for each administratio n, but may be in the same 
general location (eg arm, thigh). After proper training by [CONTACT_460043], the subject may self- administer KRN23 or the subject’s caregiver may 
self-administer KRN23 to the subject without supervision of a home health nurse. 
7.4.[ADDRESS_587384](s) 
KRN23 is supplied as a sterile, clear, colorless and preservative-free solution in single- use 
5 mL vials containing 1 mL of KRN23 at a concentration of 10 mg/mL or 30 mg/mL. Subjects will receive  study drug via SC injection to the abdomen, upper arms and thighs; the 
injection site will be rotated with each study visit,  with an option to include a different 
quadrant of the abdomen. If the dose level exceeds 1.[ADDRESS_587385] be different for each administration, but may be in the same general location (eg arm, thigh). At the discretion of the investigator and after proper training by [CONTACT_460011], the subject or a non- healthcare professional may 
administer KRN23 to the subject under without supervision of a home health nurse where

local regulations permit and where logistically feasible. Subjects o r caregivers will be 
instructed to follow the directions provided in the Instructions for Use.  
The study drug is manufactured, packaged, and labeled according to Good Manufacturing 
Practice (GMP) regulations .  
7.4.3 Storage, Handling, and Administration 
KRN23 should be securely stored in a refrigerator at 2°C to 8°C and protected from light. 
It should not be frozen. A log to document the daily temperature of the refrigerator must be 
maintained as a Good Clinical Practice (GCP) requirement. Access to and adminis tration of 
KRN23 will be limited to the investigator and authorized site staff. KRN23 must be dispensed or administered only to subjects enrolled in the study and in accordance with the protocol. 
Subjects will receive study drug via SC injection to the abd omen, upper arms, and thighs. 
The injection site will be rotated with each visit,  with the option to include a different 
quadrant of the abdomen. If the dose level exceeds 1.[ADDRESS_587386] be different for each administration, but may be in the same general location (eg arm, thigh). 
Subjects or their caregiver will receive training from study personnel in SC injection 
technique and will administer study drug under the supervision of the site personnel. After proper training by [CONTACT_460043], a subject’s caregiver may 
administer KRN23 to the subject. Subjects or caregivers will be instructed to follow the directions provided in the Instructions for Use. If the subject or caregiver demonstrates competency in administration of SC injections at that time, this will be documented, and they 
will be instructed to perform future study drug administrations at home without su pervision 
(with the exception of site visits, during which subject/caregiver administration is preferable 
to demonstrate continued competency in technique, but not required). The dosing schedule will remain the same.  
If at any time a subject/caregiver has  questions pertaining to home study drug administration, 
they may call the study site for additional training/support.  If the healthcare provider 
determines the subject/caregiver require additional training or if a subject/caregiver fails proper administra tion at any time, the investigator has discretion, in consultation with the 
Sponsor, to have the subject return to the site for subsequent study drug administration or reinstate home health nursing visits for home administration. S tudy personnel should 
periodically review the method of administration with the subject/caregiver to ensure they are 
using proper technique.  
Each administration of study drug will be recorded on the CRF. Once a subject or their 
caregiver has received appropriate SC injection tech nique training and begins administering 
study drug at home without supervision, they will be contact[CONTACT_460044]: UX023-CL203

site every 28 days ( + 5 days), with the exception of site visits, to confirm administration of 
study drug and to record related information about each administration of study drug on the 
CRF. Telephone visits may also be conducted at the clinical site depending on proximity of 
the subject to the site. Empty vials will be returned to the study site for drug accountability 
records by a HH nurse or the subject. 
7.4.4 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups  
Eligible subjects will be enrolled in the study and sequentially assigned an identification number. All subjects will receive open -label SC injections of KRN23. 
7.4.5 Selection of Dos es in the Study  
A multiple -dose, dose escalation Phase 1/2 study (KRN23- INT-001) was conducted in adult 
XLH subjects. KRN23 was well tolerated following SC administration of [ADDRESS_587387] 
escalating doses (0.05 mg/kg → 0.1 mg/kg → 0.3 mg/kg → 0.6 mg/kg) administered once per 28 days. The proportion of KRN23-treated subjects with serum phosphorus levels in the target range (>2.5 to ≤3.5 mg/dL) increased with KRN23 dose level but did not exceed the ULN (4.5 mg/dL) in any subject at any time point. A direct PK-PD relationship between 
serum KRN23 concentrations and serum phosphorus levels was noted in the study. In an associated extension study (KRN23- INT-002), doses up to 1.0 mg/kg KRN23 administered 
monthly were well tolerated by [CONTACT_460041] a period of 48 weeks.  
Previous studies with KRN23 in adult XLH patients did not show any “off target” effects; 
therefore, the safety profile is expected to be related solely to the PD effect (i.e., increased serum phosphorus). Since the defined serum phosphor us target range in this study is well 
below the ULN, the likelihood of a dose- related safety issue is low (the target fasting peak 
serum phosphorus range for this study is ≥2.5 to  ≤3.5 mg/dL [0.81 to 1.13 mmol/L]). 
The efficacy data on phosphate control from these previous studies also suggest there is a 
plateau in effect with KRN23 administered at dose levels between 0.60 mg/kg and 1.0 mg/kg. Dose adjustments will be individually titrated based on PD effects on serum phosphorus, safety, and tolerability.  
The planned duration of treatment in this study is until the end of September 2018, ranging 
from 156-184 weeks (+5 days)  depending on subject entry date. 
7.4.[ADDRESS_587388]  
All subjects will receive open -label SC injections of KR N23. The starting dose of KRN23 at 
Baseline (Week 0) in this study will be individual for each subject (i.e., the same as a subject’s last dose in studies KRN23- INT-001 or KRN23- INT-002). Dosing will occur at the 
clinic and the volume will be based on the weight obtained on Day 0.  
Up to Week 12, individual subjects who have not reached serum phosphorus levels above the LLN (2.5 mg/dL) at the end of the dose interval may have their doses titrated upward every 4 weeks (i.e., from 0.3 to 0.6 mg/kg or from 0.6 to 1.0 mg/kg) to a maximum dose of 
Protocol Number: UX023-CL203 
Amendment 2 29 September  2017 
 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  Page 44 
1.0 mg/kg based on fasting trough serum phosphorus levels. Doses may be titrated downward 
(i.e., from 1.0 to 0.6 mg/kg or from 0.6 to 0.3 mg/kg) if at any point the serum phosphorus level increases above the ULN (4.5 mg/ dL). The investigator will discuss with the medical 
monitor the need for dose titration. KRN23 injections will be repeated every 4 weeks for the duration of the study (from Week 0 through 30 September 2018), and weight will be reassessed periodically for d ose volume adjustments as needed (Table 2.1 and Table 2.2). 
The investigator must evaluate the subject’s safety assessments to determine the need for dose adjustments. If a TEAE should occur, the investigator will confer with the medical monitor and sponsor to determine acceptable conditions for dose increases or decreases. Weight will also be monitored periodically throughout the study to determine whether dose volumes need to be adjusted (see  Table 2.1 and Table 2.2). 
Dosing may be delayed should a subject experience clinically significant findings, including (but not limited to) AEs, clinical laboratory abnormalities, or physical examination findings. Dosing may be resumed, based on the outcome of the investigation (with or without dose adjustment), as deemed medically appropriate by [CONTACT_460045]. 
7.4.[ADDRESS_587389], blinding is unnecessary; 
study drug will be provided to investigators and subjects open- label. 
7.4.[ADDRESS_587390] does not receive a dose within 21 days of a scheduled dose, that dose should be 
skipped and the next dose will be administered at the next scheduled dosing visit.  
7.5 Study Procedures and Assessments  
Subjects will be brought in for a Screening Visit and asked to provide written informed consent. At the Screening Visit, inclusion/exclusion criteria will be reviewed, medical/surgical history and demographic data wi ll be collected, clinical laboratory test 
samples will be collected (blood and urine), and a renal ultrasound will be performed to confirm subject eligibility.  
Each subject who successfully meets the eligibility criteria and is enrolled in the study will undergo PHEX mutation analysis for genotype/phenotype correlations as well as the safety, immunogenicity, PD, and efficacy assessments as outlined in Table 2.1 and  Table 2.2, which 
lists the study assessments, the expected visit type/number, and the Week numbers. The Baseline Visit (Week 0) may be completed over 2 days if needed, to accommodate the 
Protocol Number: UX023-CL203 
Amendment [ADDRESS_587391] 47 protocol-defined 
visits (2 visits to complete Screening and Baseline assessments, 41  visits during the 
On-Treatment Period, and 1 EoT Visit). 
All of the visits should be conducted in a fasted state (i.e., refrain from eating and drinking, other than water) for at least [ADDRESS_587392] has successfully 
completed all Baseline assessments. For the On -Treatment Period, the study visits should be 
scheduled based on the Baseline Visit (Week 0), i.e., the first administration of open- label 
KRN23 defines Baseline. For Visits 3 through the remainder of the study, the visits should be 
scheduled on the designated visit day ±3 days. The permitted visit window may be expanded to accommodate special circumstances for all study visits.  
Subjects will report to the clinic for Screening and Baseline Visits, and for Visits 4, 6, 8, 11, 15, 19, 26, 32, 35, 38, 41, and 44 and every 24 weeks as applicable until EoT (Weeks 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, 48, 72, 84, 96, 108, 120, 132, and 144 and every 24 wee ks as applicable 
respectively). All other study assessments will be performed in the subject’s home, or at the clinic, depending on the subject’s proximity to the clinic and local availability of HH resources. The EoT Visit  will occur by 30 September 2018 . For subjects not immediately 
continuing KRN23 treatment under commercial use or another mechanism upon completion of study drug treatment or early withdrawal from this study, a Safety Follow -up TC will 
occur 4 weeks (+5 day s) after their EoT visit to collect information on whether KRN23 
treatment has been started through another mechanism and, if not, any ongoing or new AEs, SAEs, or concomitant medications. If the subject is not continuing KRN23 therapy under commercial use or another mechanism at that t ime, then site personnel will initiate a 
subsequent Safety Follow- up TC 8 weeks (+ 5 days) after the subject’s final study site visit 
to collect information on whether KRN23 treatment has been started through another mechanism and, if not, any ongoing or new AEs, SAEs, or concomitant medications.

7.5.3 Safety Measurements  
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events  
The investigator will inquire about AEs at all subject visits by [CONTACT_63397] a question such as: “How have you been feeling since your last visit?” All AEs, whether observed by [CONTACT_98138], will be recorded on the appropriate AE page of the eCRF and as appropriate on the SAE form, from the time the subject signs the informed consent through their EoT Visit or final Safety Follow -up TC as outlined in S ection 7.1. 
The Safety Follow -up telephone call (TC) that occurs 4 weeks (+5 days) after a subject’s 
EoT Visit, will collect information on whether KRN23 treatment has been started through another mechanism and, if not, any ongoing or new AEs, SAEs, or concomitant medications. If the subject is not continuing KRN23 therapy under commercial use or another mechanism at that time, then site personnel will initiate a subsequent Safety Follow -up TC 8 weeks 
(+ 5 days) after the ET Visit to collect information on whether KRN23 treatment has been 
started through another mechanism and, if not, any ongoing or new AEs, SAEs, or concomitant medications . The determination, evaluation, reporting, and follow-up of AEs 
will be performed as outlined in Section 8.5.  At each visit and the follow-up telephone call, 
subjects will be asked about any new or ongoing AEs since the previous visit. Assessments of AEs will occur at each visit to the investigational site, all HH visits, and the follow -up 
telephone call as outlined in S ection 7.1. All AEs will be evaluated to determine whether 
they meet the criteria of being a DLT (Section  [IP_ADDRESS]).  
Clinically significant changes from baseline in physical examination findings, vital signs, clinical laboratory parameters, renal ultrasounds, eGFR, ECHO, and ECGs will be recorded as AEs or SAEs, if appropriate.

If a subject experiences an AE, the subject will receive appropriate treatment and supportive 
care as necessary, and the investigator will continue to follow up on the AE until there is a return to the subject’s Baseline condition or until a clinically satisfac tory resolution is 
achieved.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Medical History  
General medical information includes subject demographics (date of birth, ethnicity, and sex) and a history of major medical illnesses, diagnoses, and surgeries. The review will also include an assessment of sym ptoms and conditions associated with XLH and standard of care 
treatment.  
Subjects must be willing to provide access to prior medical records for the collection of historical biochemical and radiographic data, as well as disease history. The specific diagnosis of XLH will be recorded, along with date of onset, clinical presentation, and date 
and method of diagnosis. A disease-specific list of signs, symptoms, and conditions associated with XLH in adults, as well as any medications administered to manage the se 
conditions, will be completed as part of the medical history. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Prior and Concomitant Medications/Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_460006] (e.g., Sensipar
®, cinacalcet, 
calcimimetics) has been taken within 2 months before the Sc reening Visit; subjects who must 
continue to take PTH suppressors will be excluded from the study, or, if medically able to 
discontinue PTH suppressors, the subject may be enrolled after a 2-month washout period. Likewise, a 21 -day washout of any active ph armacologic vitamin D metabolite or its analog 
(e.g., calcitriol, doxercalciferol, and paricalcitol), phosphate, and aluminum hydroxide antacids (e.g., Maalox
® and Mylanta®) is required for inclusion if medically able to 
discontinue those medications. Live (attenuated) vaccines (except influenza vaccines) are prohibited within 3 months prior to Screening through the EoT Visit. 
All other medications (investigational, prescription, over -the-counter, and herbal) and 
nutritional supplements taken within 30 days before the Screening Visit will be reviewed and 
recorded. Throughout the study, investigators may prescribe any concomitant medications or treatments deemed necessary to provide adequate supportive care except those listed in Section [IP_ADDRESS].1. Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (physical therapy, occupational therapy as well as mobility and 
walking devices, including ankle foot orthoses (AFOs), braces, cane, crutches, walke r, 
wheelchair etc.) used within 30 days before the Screening Visit and at Baseline will also be reviewed and recorded.

Other than the medications specifically prohibited in this protocol, subjects may receive concomitant medications as required.  
[IP_ADDRESS].3 Constraints during the Course of the Study  
Subjects are not permitted to change current diet or activity/exercise regimen from 1 week 
before dos ing to the EoT evaluation. Alcohol intake will be permitted (up to 3  drinks per 
day) during the study duration. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Vital Signs  
Vital signs (VS) will include seated systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood 
pressure (DBP) measured in millimeters of mer cury (mmHg), heart rate in beats per minute, 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_11808], and temperature in degrees Celsius (°C). Vital sign measurements will be performed pre-dose at Week 0 and at the time points indicated in Table 2.1 and Table 2.2 before any additional assessments are completed. At each site visit, 
weight (in kilograms) will be obtained using a scale. Weight measurements will be used to calculate the appropriate KRN23 volume to be administered on a mg/kg basis.  
Protocol Number: UX023-CL203 
Amendment [ADDRESS_587402]’s non-dominant arm supported at heart 
level. If possible, vital signs should be taken by [CONTACT_460047], at the same time of day and by [CONTACT_460048] a t each visit.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Physical Examination 
Physical examinations are to be performed by a qualified, licensed medical professional (i.e., MD, physician’s assistant, or nurse practitioner), as designated by [CONTACT_093]. Complete  physical examinations will be p erformed pre -dose at Week 0 and at the time points 
indicated in Table 2.1 and  Table 2.2. Physical examinations will include assessments of 
general appearance; head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat; and the cardiovascular, dermatologic, lymphatic, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], gastrointestinal, genitourinary, musculoskeletal, and neurologic systems. 
The genitourinary exam scope should be non-invasive and as per age-appropriate standard of care, at the investigator’s discretion based on clinical judgement and/or safety need. If the PI [INVESTIGATOR_460008] a genitourinary exam, it is not necessary to 
perform. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Laboratory Tests 
Fasting for a minimum of 8 hours (overnight) is required prior to each blood draw; the duration of fasting will be recorded on the eCRF. Blood and urine samples will be collected at Screening, pre-dose at Baseline, and at regular intervals throughout the study, as indicated in Table 2.1 and Table 2.2. The local lab at the investigational sites will be used to assess 
safety parameters required for study eligibility (except FGF23). For the laboratory assessments coll ected at Screening, any results that fall outside the laboratory normal range 
will be considered abnormal and will be recorded in the medical history. The investigator will indicate whether laboratory test results are CS or NCS.  
A comprehensive serum metabolic panel (Chem -20), complete blood count, and urinalysis 
will be used as routine screens to assess KRN23 safety. Certain analytes (i.e., ALP and serum phosphorus) in the routine Chem- 20 panel are also designated as PD/efficacy parameters in 
this study (S ection 7.5.1). KRN23/XLH biochemical parameters of interest include serum 
amylase, lipase, total calcium, creatinine, FGF23, and iPTH; and urinary c alcium and 
creatinine. Reflexive testing for amylase isoenzymes will be performed if serum amylase levels are elevated by ≥1.5 the upper limit of the reference range. FGF23 concentrations will be measured using validated assays.  
Twenty-four hour urine collection is required to assess urinary phosphorus:creatinine and 
calcium:creatinine ratios; urinary phosphorus (a PD parameter, Section [IP_ADDRESS])  will also be 
obtained from 24-hour urine samples. The fasting 2-hour urine collection (collected in conjunction with the 24-hour urine collection) is also required, to determine TmP/GFR levels. The 2-hour and 24-hour urine collection will be performed at Screening for TmP/GFR eligibility and at Weeks 12, 24, 36, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144, and every 24 weeks as applicable

The following laboratory abnormalities should be captured on the SAE form and/or eCRF, as 
appropriate: 
• Any laboratory  test result that meets the criteria for an SAE  
• Any laboratory abnormality that requires the subject to have study medication 
discontinued or interrupted 
• Any laboratory abnormality that requires the subject to receive specific corrective therapy  
Any clinic ally significant abnormal laboratory tests occurring during the study will be 
repeated at appropriate intervals until 1 or more of the following occur: 
• The value returns to Baseline 
• The value is judged to be clinically acceptable by [CONTACT_422910] e sponsor 
• A diagnosis is reached that explains the abnormal laboratory value 
Whenever possible, the investigator should report the clinical rather than the laboratory term 
(e.g., anemia, vs. low hemoglobin [Hb]). 
Subjects who experience an SAE possibly or probably related to study drug or other AE of 
concern may, at the discretion of the investigator (and/or medical monitor), have additional blood samples taken for safety laboratory tests.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Anti-KRN23 Antibody Scree ning 
To determine the immunogenicity profile of KRN23, blood samples will be obtained for analysis of ADA pre -dose at Weeks 0, 4, 12, 24, 36, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144, and every 
24 weeks as applicable through the EoT Visit as indicated in Table 2.1 and Table 2.2. 
The concentration of anti-KRN23 antibodies in human serum will be determined using a 
validated sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and a 2- tiered strategy: 
screening assay and  specificity confirmation assay. If the development of anti- KRN23 
antibodies is suspected in a given subject, samples may be obtained at additional time points on a case-by-case basis, if warranted.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Renal Ultrasound 
Renal ultrasounds will be conducted at Screening and at Weeks 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144, and every 24 weeks as applicable through the EoT Visit as indicated in Table 2.1 and Table 2.2. 
The ultrasound may be performed either before or after administration of KRN23 while on treatment. The screening ultrasound will be interpreted by [CONTACT_460049]. However, central readings will be performed for all on-treatment renal ultrasounds to evaluate changes in calcifications and all other renal abnormalities from Baseline. Ratings  will be performed by a 
single central reader.

[IP_ADDRESS] Echocardiogram  
ECHO will be performed pre -dose at Week 0 and either before or after administration of 
KRN23 at Weeks 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144, and every 24 weeks as applicable through the EoT 
Visit. The goal is twofold: 1) assess for evidence of ectopic mineralization in the heart and 
aorta, and 2) evaluate for signs of LVH or cardiac dysfunction. Additional tests may be performed if any abnormalities are detected or if medically indicated. ECHO administration procedures will be standardized and results will be read centrally by [CONTACT_460050]. ECHOs will be assessed for any clinically significant abnormality or relevant changes from Baseline (CFB), and new evidence of cardiac calcifications, LVH, or other new abnormalities will be recorded as TEAEs. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Electrocardiogram  
A standardized 12- lead ECG will measure PR, QRS, QT, and corrected QT (QTc) intervals 
pre-dose at Week [ADDRESS_587403]’s source documents. New evidence of LVH or other new abnormalities will be recorded as TEAEs.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Pregnancy Testing  
Female subjects of child -bearing potential must be non-pregnant and non-nursing and will 
have urine pregnancy tests pre-dose at all dosing visits and at EoT, as indicated in Table 2.[ADDRESS_587404] consent to use a highly effective method of contraception as listed below from the period following the signing of the informed consent through 12 weeks (approximately 5 times the elimination half- life) after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_35620]. Sexually active male participants with female partners of childbearing potential must consent to use a condom with spermicide or a highly effective method of contraception

listed below from the period following the signing of informed consent through 12 weeks 
after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_35648]. Examples of highly effective methods include: 
• Combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception associated with 
inhibition of ovulation (e.g. oral, intravaginal, transdermal) 
• Progestogen -only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation (e.g. 
oral, injectable, implantable)  
• Intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine hormone- releasing system (IUS)  
• Bilateral tubal occlusion  
• Male sterilization, also called vasectomy  
• Sexual abstinence (i.e., refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study treatments, when this is in lin e with the preferred and 
usual lifestyle of the subject)  
[IP_ADDRESS] Pregnancy in Subject or  Partner 
Pregnancies in subjects or partners must be reported within [ADDRESS_587405]’s partner, while participating in the 
study, will be monitored for the full duration and/or followed until the outcome of the pregnancy is known.In the event of a pregnancy in the partner of a subject, the investigator should make every effort to obtain the female partner’s consent for release of protected health information. Refer to the Study Reference Manual for details on the reporting procedures to follow in the event of pregnancy. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Dose-limiting Toxicity  
A DLT is defined as the occurrence of any of the following: 
• A Grade 3 or higher toxicity (based on the National Cancer Institute’s (NCI) Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE] Version 4 ( NCI 2010 ) that occurs 
during treatment and is considered to be either possibly, probably, or definitely related to study drug 
• A confirmed serum phosphorus level of ≥6.5 mg/dL (defined as hyperphosphatemia) at any time after dosing  
If a subject experiences a DLT, the planned dosing for that subject will be evaluated by [CONTACT_173875]. The outcome of this investigation will determine the subjects’ continuation or withdrawal from the study.

[IP_ADDRESS] Other Safety Considerations  
Any clinically significant changes in safety assessments noted during the study, whether or 
not these assessments are required by [CONTACT_760], must also be recorded on the appropriate AE page of the eCRF and the SAE form, as appropriate, in order for the sponsor to collect additional information about that abnormality, including information regarding relationship to Investigational Product (IP), any action taken, and resolution. 
7.5.4 Appropriateness of Measurements  
As described in Section 5, XLH is characterized by [CONTACT_460033] 1,25(OH)
2D, leading to 
signs/symptoms of bone pain and osteomalacia; increased risk of bone fractures; joint abnormalities and joint pain; enthesopathy; and osteoarthritis ( Tenenhouse et al. 2001) ; (Reid 
et al. 1989) . Measurements chosen for this study are therefore appropriate to assess the PD 
impact and safety profile of KRN23 on the disease characteristics over time, as well as to explore the efficacy of KRN23 in improving bone mineralization; strength, balance, and agility; and overall QoL.  
7.6 Statistical Methods and Determination of Sample Size  
The completeness of the data affects the integrity and accuracy of the final study analysis. Therefore, every effort will be made to ensure complete, accurate and timely data collection, and to avoid missing data. The procedures for handling missing, spurious, or unused data, and the detailed method for analyses will be presented in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP); the information below is intended as a guide to planned analyses.

Medical Assembly General Assembly (Helsinki, 1964) and subsequent amendments and clarifications adopted by [CONTACT_11878]. The investigator will make every effort that the study described in this protocol is conducted in full conformance with those principles, current US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations, International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) GCP guidelines, and local ethical and regulatory requirements. Should a conflict arise, the investigator w ill follow whichever law or guideline 
affords the greater protection to the individual subject. The investigator will also make sure he or she is thoroughly familiar with the appropriate administration and potential risks of administration of the IP, as described in this protocol and the IB, prior to the initiation of the study. 
8.1.[ADDRESS_587416] receive a copy of the IRB's approval of the ICF before the shipment of IP to the study site. 
It is the investigator's responsibility to obtain signed written  informed consent from each 
potential study subject prior to the conduct of any study procedures. This written informed 
consent will be obtained after the methods, objectives, requirements, and potential risks of the study have been fully explained to each potential subject. The investigator must explain 
Protocol Number: UX023-CL203 
Amendment [ADDRESS_587417] is completely free to refuse to enter the study or to withdraw 
from it at any time.  
The method of obtaining and documenting informed consent and the contents of the ICF will comply with ICH GCP guidelines, the requirements of 21 CFR Part 50, “Protection of Human Subjects,” the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) regulations, and all other applicable regulatory requirements. Subjects will be given a copy of the signed ICF and will be provided any new information during the course of the study that might affect their continued participation in the study. The investigator or a qualified designee will be available to answer each subject's questions throughout the study, and all of the subject's questions must be answered to the subject's satisfaction. If the protocol is amended and the ICF is revised, each subject will be required to provide written informed consent again using the revised ICF. 
Receipt of written informed consent will be documented in each potential subject’s eCRF. 
The signed ICF will remain in each subject's study file and must be available to the study monitor(s) at all times.  
8.[ADDRESS_587418] provide Ultragenyx and/or its designee a completed and signed Form FDA [ADDRESS_587419] be comple ted for all sub -investigators listed 
on Form FDA 1572. 
Ultragenyx and/or its designee will be responsible for managing and monitoring the clinical 
trial to ensure compliance with FDA and ICH GCP guidelines. Ultragenyx's trained designated representative (t he monitor) will conduct regular visits to the clinical site, to 
perform source document verification. The monitor will verify the investigator's ongoing qualifications, to inspect clinical site facilities, and to inspect study records, including proof of IRB review, with the stipulation that subject confidentiality will be maintained in 
accordance with local and federal regulations, including HIPAA requirements.  
8.[ADDRESS_587420] Accountability 
The investigator, institution, or head of the medical institution (where applicable) is 
responsible for IP accountability, reconciliation, and record maintenance through the course of the study. While at the clinical site, IP must be stored in a secure limited access location at controlled temperature as descr ibed in the IB and according to product packaging. 
The storage facility must be available for inspection by [CONTACT_460058]. Subjects will be given instructions on the proper storage of IP when initially 
Protocol Number: UX023-CL203 
Amendment 2 29 September  2017 
 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  Page 65 
dispensed and reminded of storage requirements at all subsequent visits (see also 
Section 7.4.3). 
A drug accountability record must be maintained for all Investigational Product received, dispensed, returned, and/or lost during the study. This record must be kept current and made available to the study monitor for inspection. Following the close-out of the study, all unused IP must be returned to Ultragenyx and/or its designee unless other instructions have been provided for final disposition of the investigational product.  
8.[ADDRESS_587421]. A validated Electronic Data Capture (EDC) system will be used for en try of the data 
into eCRFs. Data must be recorded on eCRFs approved by [CONTACT_11881]. All information recorded on eCRFs for this study must be consistent with the subject's source 
documentation.  
Initial data entry and any changes to the data will be made only by [CONTACT_460059], and data entries and changes will be captured in an electronic audit trail. An 
explanation of any data change should be recorded in the eCRF. All data entered in to the eCRF- must be verifiable; therefore, eCRFs will be routinely checked for accuracy, 
completeness, and clarity and will be cross -checked for consistency with source documents, 
including laboratory test reports and other subject records by [CONTACT_11881]. The investigator must allow d irect access to all source documents.  
8.4.2 Data Quality Assurance 
Monitoring and auditing procedures developed by [CONTACT_11883]/or its designee will be implemented to ensure compliance with FDA and ICH GCP guidelines. Ultragenyx's designated representative (th e monitor) will contact [CONTACT_460060]. The monitor will be expected and allowed to verify the investigator's qualifications, to inspect clinical site facilities, and to inspect study records, including proof of IRB review, with the stipulation that subject confidentiality will be maintained in accordance with local and federal regulations, including HIPAA requirements. The monitor will also be responsible for confirming adherence to the study protocol, inspect ing eCRFs 
and source documents, and ensuring the integrity of the data. eCRFs will be checked for accuracy, completeness, and clarity and will be cross -checked for consistency with source 
documents, including laboratory test reports and other subject records. Instances of missing or uninterruptable data will be resolved in coordination with the investigator. 
The monitor will also investigate any questions concerning adherence to regulatory 
requirements. Any administrative concerns will be clarified and followed. The monitor will maintain contact [CONTACT_460061]: UX023-CL203 
Amendment 2 29 September  2017 
 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  Page 66 
e-mail, telephone, facsimile, and/or mail. The investigator and all other site personnel agree 
to cooperate fully with the monitor and will work in good faith with the monitor to resolve any and all questions raised and any and all issues identified by [CONTACT_2037]. 
The investigator understands that regulatory authorities, the IRB, and/or Ultragenyx or its 
designees have the right to access all  eCRFs, source documents, and other study 
documentation for on- site audit or inspection and will retain this right from the start of the 
study to at least [ADDRESS_587422] with retention should the Investigator/institution be unable to continue maintenance of subject files for the full [ADDRESS_587423] medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in 
humans, whether or not considered drug related. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) products. 
A suspected adverse reaction  is any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the 
drug caused the AE. For the purposes of expedited safety reporting, “reasonable possibility” 
means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the AE. 
Suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse 
reaction, which means any AE caused by a drug.  
Life-threatening AE or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction is an AE or suspected 
adverse reaction that, in the view of either the investigator or sponsor, places the patient or subject at immediate risk of death. It does not include an AE  or suspected adverse reaction 
that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death. 
An SAE or serious suspected adverse reaction is an AE or suspected adverse reaction that at 
any dose, in the view of either the investigator or sponsor, results in any of the following outcomes:  
Protocol Number: UX023-CL203 
Amendment 2 29 September  2017 
 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  Page 67 
• Death 
• A life-threatening AE  
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• Persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions 
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect  
Important medical events that may not result in death, be immediately life -threatening, or 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the definition.  
Note that hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11818] (e.g. for elective surgeries) are 
not considered SAEs. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11819]- existing conditions that are 
scheduled after study enrollment are considered SAEs. 
8.5.2 Severity of Adverse Events  
Wherever possible, the severity of all AEs will be graded using the NCI CTCAE version 4.0. 
The majority of AEs can be graded using this system.  
If an AE cannot be graded using the CTCAE criteria, it should be graded as mild, moderate, 
severe, life-threatening, or death using the following definitions. 
• Mild (Grade 1):  Awareness of signs or symptoms, but easily tolerated and are of a minor 
irritant type, causing no loss of time from normal activities. Symptoms do not require 
therapy or a medical evaluation; signs and symptoms are transient.  
• Moderate (Grade 2):  Events introduce a low level of inconvenience or concern to the 
participant and may interfere with daily activities, but are usually improved by [CONTACT_14212]; moderate experiences may cause some interference wi th 
functioning. 
• Severe (Grade 3):  Events interrupt the participant’s normal daily activities and generally 
require systemic drug therapy or other treatment; they are usually incapacitating.  
• Life-threatening (Grade 4):  Events that place the participant at  immediate risk of death 
or disabling. 
• Death (Grade 5):  Events that result in death.  
To ensure that there is no confusion or misunderstanding of the difference between the terms "serious" and "severe," which are not synonymous, the following note of clarific ation is 
provided. The term "severe" is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific 
Protocol Number: UX023-CL203 
Amendment 2 29 September  2017 
 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  Page 68 
event (as in mild, moderate, or severe myocardial infarction); the event itself, however, may 
be of relatively minor medical significance (such as severe headache). This is not the same as "serious" which is based on subject/event outcome or action criteria usually associated with events that pose a threat to a subject's life or functioning. Seriousness (not severity) serves as a guide for defining regulatory reporting obligations. 
8.5.3 Relationship of Adverse Events to Study Drug  
The investigator will assess the potential relationship of the AE to study drug using the 
following descriptions.  
Categories of attributions for “Not Related” events: 
• Definitely Not Related : This category applies to an AE that is clearly not related  to the 
investigational agent/procedure, beyond a reasonable doubt. That is, another cause of the event is most plausible; and/or a clinically plausible temporal sequence is inconsistent with the onset of the event and the exposure to study drug and/or a causal relationship is 
considered biologically implausible. 
• Probably Not Related:  This category applied to an AE that is doubtfully related  to the 
investigational agent/procedure. That is, an alternative explanation is more likely, e.g., concomitant drug(s), concomitant disease(s), known consequences of the disease under investigation or the relationship in time suggest that a causal relation ship is unlikely. 
Categories of attributions for “Related” events: 
• Possibly Related:  This category applies to an AE that may be related  to the 
investigational agent/procedure. That is the AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the study drug and that follows a known or expected response pattern to the suspected study drug, but that could readily have been produce d by a 
number of other factors. 
• Probably Related:  This category applies to an AE that is likely related  to the 
investigational agent/procedure. That is, the AE has a temporal relationship to the administration of the investigational agent(s) or research in tervention, follows a known 
or suspected pattern of response, and is strongly associated with study drug exposure. An alternative explanation is less likely (e.g., concomitant drugs(s), concomitant 
medication(s)).  
• Definitely Related:  This category applies to an AE that is clearly related  to the 
investigational agent/procedure. That is, the AE is listed as a possible adverse reaction and cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_4867], e.g., concomitant drug(s), concomitant disease(s), known consequences of the disease under investigation or the relationship in time is very suggestive (e.g., it is confirmed by [CONTACT_35719]).  
Protocol Number: UX023-CL203 
Amendment 2 29 September  2017 
 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  Page 69 
For regulatory reporting purposes, AEs deemed as Definitely, Probably, or Possibly Related 
will be considered Related, and those deemed Definitely Not or Probably Not Related will be considered Unrelated.  
8.5.4 Adverse Event Reporting to Ultragenyx  
All AEs (i.e., any new or worsening in severity or frequency of a pre-existing condition) with onset after the subject si gns informed consent must be promptly documented on the AE 
eCRF via the EDC system. The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_460010], obtaining supporting documents, and ensuring documentation of the event is adequate. Details of the AE mus t include severity, relationship to study drug, duration of AE (with start 
and stop dates, as applicable), and outcome. 
All AEs will be collected from the time the subject signs informed consent through their EoT 
Visit or final Safety Follow -up TC as outlined in S ection 7.1. In addition, the investigator 
may report any AE that occurs after this time period that is believed to have a reasonable 
possibility of being associated with study drug. For AEs that are ongoing beyond the follow-up telephone call (Week 152), the investigator should comment in the source document whether the event has recovered, recovered with sequelae, or stabilized. 
8.5.[ADDRESS_587424] be notified of the occurrence of any SAE that occurs during the reporting period within 24 hours of the investigator’s, designee’s, or site personnel’s knowledge of the event. SAEs will be reported by [CONTACT_460062].  
Follow-up SAE information must be submitted in a timely manner as additional information 
becomes avai lable. All SAEs, regardless of relationship to study drug, must be followed to 
resolution or stabilization if improvement is not expected.  
All deaths, regardless of causality, that occur from signing of the informed consent through 
EoT Visit or final Safet y Follow-up TC (Section 7.1)  must  be reported as SAEs as described 
previously.  
8.5.[ADDRESS_587425]’s part ner that is reported while participating in the 
study will be monitored for the full term and or followed until the outcome of the pregnancy 
is known. Pregnancy- associated SAEs will be processed and submitted as necessary, as per 
the suspected unexpected s erious adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]R) reporting process described in 
the following section. 
Protocol Number: UX023-CL203 
Amendment [ADDRESS_587426] knowledge of the event and follow-up information will be submitted within an additional eight (8) days. All other S[LOCATION_003]Rs will be submitted within [ADDRESS_587427] knowledge of the event. 
Principal Investigators are required to report any urgent safety matters to Ultragenyx or its 
designee within 24 hours. Ultragenyx or its designee will inform the regulatory authorities and investigators of any events (e.g., change to the safety profile of KRN23, major safety findings) that may occur during the clinical trial that do not fall within the definition of a S[LOCATION_003]R but may affect the safety of subjects participating in the clinical trials, as required in accordance with ap plicable laws and regulations. The reporting period for urgent safety 
issues is the period from signing the informed consent through [ADDRESS_587428] be provided to Ultragenyx or its designee.  
Non-S[LOCATION_003]Rs will be maintained in the Ultragenyx safety database and provided in annual 
and/or periodic reports as per local laws and regulations. Ultragenyx or its designee will 
prepare and submit annual safety reports and/or other aggregate periodic summary reports to regulatory authorities, as required

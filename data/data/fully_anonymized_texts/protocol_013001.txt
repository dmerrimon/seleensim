The purpose of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_57830].  
2  BACKGROUND  INFORMATION  
Unwanted excess fat pockets/bulges have been among the top concerns expressed by [CONTACT_57835].  Although surgical interventions produce the most definitive results with body contouring, these invasive methods require significant recovery  time and come with inherent risks.   
 As a non -invasive option, laser, intense pulsed light (IPL), RF, or a combination of these technologies have 
been developed to reduce cellulite and body circumference with minimal recovery time and risks [1]. The tightening effect of the thermal energy generated by [CONTACT_57836], abdomen, thigh, back and flanks [2 -
14].  Although lasers and IPLs can target the deep dermal layers, the thermal effects of these devices are limited due to light scattering and energy absorption by [CONTACT_57837].  
 RF, which is the most studied device in the non -ablative category, uses electrical current rather than light 
energy.   Unlike light energy, radio waves can penetrate deeper depending on the frequency of operation. 
RF can be used with all Fitzpatrick skin types without jeopardizing epi[INVESTIGATOR_57831] [15].   
 Magnitude of thermal energy generated is dependent on the resi stance (impedance) of the target tissue.  
When RF energy is conducted electrically to tissue, heat is produced as the tissue’s inherent resistance (impedance) converts the electrical current to thermal energy [(J) = I x R x T where I = current, R = tissue impedance, and T = time of application)].  Subcutaneous fat which is a high impedance tissue generates 
greater heat and accounts for the deeper thermal effects of RF devices [15 -18].   
 
RF may be delivered in three different ways: 1) Monopolar when energy is applied as current between a single electrode tip and a grounding plate.  2) Bipolar when energy is applied between two points on the tip of a probe.  3) Unipolar when energy is delivered as the emission of electromagnetic radiation (EMR) rather than cu rrent and no grounding pad is necessary. This could be achieved by [CONTACT_57838], inductive or 
resonant electrical coupling with the tissue.

subsequent visit using the following scale:  
1= mild: requires minimal or no treatment and does not interfere with the subject’s daily activities.  
2= moderate: may cause some interference with functioning.  
3= severe: interrupts subject ’s usual daily activity and may require treatment.  
Treatment -related Discomfort : 
After each treatment, subjects will be asked to rate the average amount of discomfort experienced during treatment and immediately after treatment using the Pain Rating Scale (VAS Scale) Appendix 2.  
4.4 Study Discontinuation  
Cutera, Inc. (the sponsor) has the right to terminate this study at any time.  Reasons for terminating the study may include, but are not limited to, the following: incidence or severity of adverse events in this or other studies indicates a potential health hazard to subjects; subject enrollment is unsatisfactory; number of protocol deviations is unacceptable; data recording is inaccurate or incomplete; or questionable study site c ompliance with ICH- E6, Good Clinical Practice . 
4.5 Investigator Selection  
The Investigator(s) will be invited to participate in the study based on his or her medical specialty, experience conducting clinical research studies and experience in the use of RF  devices for aesthetic 
indications. Access to potential study subjects and the Investigator’s sincere interest in this study along with expressed willingness to cooperate with the study process and requirements are  also considered.

device.   
9.2 Analysis Sets  
The analysis sets will include all enrolled subjects who complete treatment.

Formal hypothesis testing and statistical analysis are not planned for this study.  
9.4 Safety Analyses  
Device -related and procedure -related adverse effects (AEs) will be tabulated and analyzed. For a given AE 
term, counting will be done by [CONTACT_1130], not by [CONTACT_15992], i.e. for a subject reporting the same AE more than once, the event will be counted only once, at the most severe and longest duration. The number and percentage of subjects experiencing each AE Term will be descriptively summarized.

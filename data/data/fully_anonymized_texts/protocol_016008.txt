 Evaluating a Brief Type 2 Diabetes Prevention Program with Greater Scalability [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] April 16, [ADDRESS_308581] the effectiveness of a Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) prevention program for individuals who have been diagnosed with prediabetes compared to a T2D educational control group. Project health is an obesity prevention program and has produced a 42% to 53% reduction in future onset of overweight/obesity and also produced greater reductions in negative affect compared to assessment-only controls that persisted. Project Health has been adapted to prevent onset of T2D among individuals with prediabetes. The study aims to test the effectiveness of Project Health at reducing BMI, HbA1c levels, increase physical activity and improve glucose control.  b. Objectives Aim [ADDRESS_308582] because the programs require speech as a method of communication.  2. STUDY PROCEDURES a. Procedures

See section [ADDRESS_308584] them to confirm eligibility. Consent (for ages 18- 65) will be secured prior to enrollment.  Baseline Assessment: After eligibility is confirmed but before groups begin, the participant will come in for their baseline assessment. At baseline, participants will complete the the Paffenbarger Activity Questionnaire to assess physical activity, the Beck Depression Inventory, and the Eating Disorder Diagnostic Scale. We will also have participants get an HbA1c test and fasting glucose test through the Stanford CTRU. Finally, participants will complete a Bod Pod Assessment, measuring Body Fat. Prior to the start of groups, participants will complete the Automated Self-Administered 24-hr Dietary Recall (ASA-24) to assess dietary intake on 2 weekdays and 1 weekend.  Prevention program: After baseline assessments are completed, participants will be randomized to either the Project Health groups or the educational control.  Randomization:  We will use a random number generator to determine if participants will be in Project Health or the educational control. If an even number is generated, the participant will be assigned Project Health. If an odd number is generated, the participant will be assigned to educational control. As there is a 50% chance the number will be either even or odd, there is a 50% chance that someone will be assigned either to Project Health or the educational control. It is only after the baseline assessment that individuals will be randomized. This will prevent the assessor at baseline from being influenced by [CONTACT_253659]. The assessor completing the assessments at post-test and 3-month follow-up will be blind to the participant's condition.  Project Health: Project Health will be delivered in six 1-hour group sessions that will be held weekly. In addition, participants will be asked to complete 30 mins of response inhibition and attention trainings once per week between the sessions. This program promotes to retain the gradual lifestyle modification designed to bring energy intake into balance with energy output and the food response inhibition and attention training, but will adapt the dissonance-induction activities to focus on the negative 
04/16/[ADDRESS_308585] Health condition will receive reminders and writing prompts via a secure text messaging platform, TextMagic. The text reminders will be used to remind participants to complete the writing prompts and one computer task between group sessions. This computer task is a choice of one game that the participants had played during their intervention group. The writing prompts being used will help to reinforce the response inhibition and attention trainings. No personal participant information will be shared or asked for via TextMagic.  Educational Control:        We selected a T2D management psychoeducational comparison condition. To match Project Health, the educational videos will be delivered in [ADDRESS_308586]: After the six weeks of either Project Health or the educational control, participants will be asked to complete the same assessments that they did at baseline, but not the blood tests.  3-Month Follow-up: At 3-month follow-up, participants will again complete the assessments. After the 3-month follow-up, participants have completed all study responsibilities.  1-Year Follow-Up: We propose to collect A1c data over [ADDRESS_308587] patient. If they haven't had a recent test or not in Stanford system we will ask if they would be willing to send any recent A1c blood test results. If no to both, the participant will be offered to have an HbA1c kit sent to them to do a finger prick at home. The participant will send the kit to the research lab in Minnesota to be processed. Kits come with already pre-paid shippi[INVESTIGATOR_253651], no return address or any PHI from the participant is included. The participant will be offered a $[ADDRESS_308588] Health has also been tested in 
04/16/[ADDRESS_308589] the option of not participating in conversations or exercises in the intervention modules that cause them any discomfort. They will also be free to withdraw from participating in the intervention and/or overall study at any time. Survey measures are non-invasive and present minimal risk. Using blood draws for A1c may be minimally invasive but provide no added level of risk or discomfort beyond routine diabetes management tasks. c. Use of Deception in the Study Deception will not be used. d. Use of Audio and Video Recordings Participants will be informed that we will make video recordings of Project Health groups for clinical supervision and quality assurance purposes. These recordings will be reviewed by [CONTACT_253660]. Email supervision based on these ratings will be provided to facilitators which has been found to maximize intervention effects. After they are viewed and rated for fidelity and competence, all records of the recordings will be deleted from devices and destroyed. Recordings are not optional. As the group sessions are in-person it is possible for someone to go out of view of the camera, but their voices will still be recorded. There are three main factors that increase cognitive dissonance: public accountability, level of effort, and voluntary basis. By [CONTACT_253661], public accountability is greatly increased, and the effect of the intervention improves. Thus, if they are in Project Health individuals must be willing to be recorded. e. Alternative Procedures or Courses of Treatment There are not any programs designed to decrease risk of T2D. f. Will it be possible to continue the more (most) appropriate therapy for the participant(s) after the conclusion of the study? If Project Health produces significantly larger improvements than the educational lectures, we will offer the Project Health to educational controls. g. Study Endpoint(s) It is important to test whether effects persist at 3-month follow-up even if there are good effects at posttest, as it is possible that the effects may not persist. The effects of this brief prevention program typi[INVESTIGATOR_253652] 3- year follow-ups. 3. BACKGROUND  a. Past Experimental and/or Clinical Findings Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a chronic condition which affects the way the body regulates and uses glucose as a fuel, resulting in excess blood glucose levels, which contributes to disorders of the circulatory, nervous and immune systems. T2D affects approximately 415 million people 
04/16/2023  Page 5 of 15 globally; an estimated 642 million will be affected by 2040 (International Diabetes Federation, 2015). T2D is the leading cause of end-stage renal failure, adult-onset blindness, and nontraumatic amputations, and markedly increases risk for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality (World Health Organization, 2010), resulting in a significant burden on individuals and the healthcare system (Li, Qu, Zhang, et al. 2015).  Three randomized trials have now confirmed that lifestyle modification interventions, which teach lifestyle modifications that reduce excess body weight can significantly reduce progression to T2D among individuals with prediabetes (Pan, Li, Hu, et al, 1997; Tuomilehto, Lindstrom, Eriksson, et al, 2001; Diabetes Prevention Program Research Group, 2002). However, these interventions were very intensive, often requiring over 40 hours of individual counseling and coaching delivered over 1- to 2-year periods. Such intensive interventions, particularly when delivered on an individual basis, are extremely difficult to broadly implement (Damschroder & Hagedorn, 2011). A briefer intervention that would be less expensive to deliver would be much easier to implement on a broad enough scale to reduce the population prevalence of T2D. For instance, we have been able to implement a brief 4-hour eating disorder prevention program to over 6 million adolescent girls in 140 countries to date (Stice et al., 2021).  Fortunately, our research team created a brief obesity prevention program that has produced a 42% to 53% reduction in future onset of overweight/obesity in three randomized controlled trials (Stice et al., 2008; 2014; 2020). The 3-hour Healthy Weight obesity prevention program produced a statistically significant 53% reduction in overweight or obesity onset over 3-year follow-up versus assessment-only controls for adolescent girls and young women with body image concerns and produced. b.

As this is the first test of an adapted Project Health for individuals with Type [ADDRESS_308591] students, employees, and laboratory personnel may be eligible to participate in this research study. We cannot estimate how many that might be. If any such participants are enrolled, they will go through the informed consent process as any other participant would and receive payment for their participation. f.  Healthy Volunteers N/A g. Recruitment Details Recruitment will take place using both online and in person strategies. Online - Ads will be posted on the internet using social media sites: Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram, community forums: Craigslist and Reddit, and the study website. We will manage an instagram and facebook page with postings about the study using the approved images and captions. All posts on the page will be moderated by [CONTACT_253662]. Posting of online ads will be managed based on inclusion criteria, i.e. within the area of the sites, age, etc. If not possible to post within the geographic area we are recruiting (such as on Reddit), then we will specify within post that potential participants must live near the Bay Area. the Social media recruitment posts will be set up such that the security settings do not allow participants or others from the public to post on the wall/public forum. If this is not possible due to the social media platform's settings, the social media posts 
04/16/[ADDRESS_308592] Diabetes Research Center's clinical registry (in which subjects have already consented to be recruited for research studies). Stanford Diabetes Research Center's clinical registry is composed of individuals who have expressed interest in participating in research and have voluntarily included their name [CONTACT_225755][CONTACT_253663]. More information on the SDRC registry can be found at: https://sdrc.stanford.edu/clinical-research-registry.  Participants will also be recruited through online flyers sent out through established diabetes-related listervs run by [CONTACT_225750].  The IRB-approved recruitment flyer and email will also be circulated through online websites, forums newsletters, emails listervs, and social media pages (primarily run by [CONTACT_225751]) and shared with diabetes providers and clinics within and outside of Stanford.  We are also going to use Researchmatch.org.  In addition, we will partner with the Research Participant Engagement Program (RPEP) team for Honest Broker outreach. Potential participants are identified via STARR and invited by [CONTACT_253664] (honest broker) on behalf of study team. See Section [ADDRESS_308593] Email / SHC Epic MyHealth / Postal Mail honest broker outreach. For Direct Email, RPEP team provides (via secure Box folder) contact [CONTACT_253665]. For Epic MyHealth, study team receives only the interested responses via Epic MyHealth InBasket. For Postal Mail, study team may support the process by [CONTACT_253666]-printed address labels (created by [CONTACT_253667], the honest broker) on the envelopes. Invitations will not be sent to the same individual via more than one honest broker outreach method, unless as a separate reminder. The study team will respond to the patient via MyHealth thanking them for their interest, ask them to set up a time to talk on the phone, obtain verbal consent before questions are asked over the phone, and then send our screening survey link that includes a consent and HIPAA Authorization, and confirm their availability for an initial visit.    h. Eligibility Criteria i. Inclusion Criteria (1) 18-65 years of age (2) BMI (kg/m2) ≥ 25 or ≥ 23 for Asian Americans (4) high-risk prediabetes, defined as 1 of 3 criteria: (1) FPG value = 110-125 mg/dL,

Exclusion Criteria  (1) a medically confirmed diagnosis of type 1 diabetes, (2) use of anti-hyperglycemic medications (e.g., Metformin) or weight-loss medications (3) having a medical condition that would interfere with engagement in a behavior change program (e.g., cancer) (4) pregnancy i. Screening Procedures  Participants will indicate interest by [CONTACT_12550] a short survey on a secured platform, such as REDCap, that asks them for contact [CONTACT_3031]. From there, a member of the research team will contact [CONTACT_253668]. Prior to the phone screen, the research team will send the potential participant the consent to review before going through it with the research team. j. Participation in Multiple Protocols  As a part of the informed consent process, subjects will be asked if they are participating in any other research projects. Their participation in other protocols will not exclude them from participation in this study.  k. Payments to Participants Participants will be eligible to earn up to $150 for completion of all study activities. $25 will be awarded per completion of each assessment and blood testing (pre-test, post-test, 3-month) and then an additional $25 if all assessments are completed. With a $[ADDRESS_308594] for 1-year follow-up. (1) baseline = $25 (2) baseline blood tests = $25 (3) post-test = $25 (4) 3 month follow-up = $25 (5) 3-month follow-up blood test = $25 (6) completion of all the previous five = $25 (7) 1-year follow-up blood test = $[ADDRESS_308595] to participants. m. Planned Duration of the Study 
04/16/[ADDRESS_308596] about 4 months. Participants will complete the baseline assessment (1.5 hours) and collect HbA1c levels, then complete the six-week intervention (each session is one hour), and then a post-test assessment (about 1.5 hours) and HbA1c. After the initial baseline assessment and the post-test, participants will have completed all necessary tasks until the 3-month follow-up where they will complete the same tasks as the baseline and post-test assessments. While the groups are running, data analysis on baseline data will begin. Once we have complete data for posttest and 3-month follow-up, we will conduct data analysis on the outcome measures. We propose to collect A1c data over [ADDRESS_308597] patient. If they haven't had a recent test or not in Stanford system we will ask if they would be willing to send any recent A1c blood test results. If no to both, the participant will be offered to have an HbA1c kit sent to them to do a finger prick at home and send it to a lab in Minnesota to be processed. 9. RISKS a. Potential Risks i.

Survey data collection will only occur through tools and resources that have acceptable security features. We will minimize all communications that involve names or other identifying information. All clinically-relevant and study information will be kept in locked files in locked offices or password protected files  All recordings of intervention sessions will be saved on a password-protected secure server. Information about subjects will not be accessible to any non-authorized study personnel without the written consent of the subject. In all datasets we will use ID numbers only. A separate dataset linking names with ID numbers will be accessible only to authorized study personnel under the direction of the PI.  There’s a small chance there will be some discomfort upon pricking their finger and collecting their HbA1c levels if they have never done one before. Sometimes the discomfort can last a day or two but often is mild and goes away. If the discomfort persists, we will ask them to contact [CONTACT_3019]. v. Radioisotopes/radiation-producing machines  N/A vi. Physical well-being There is a chance of some discomfort upon having their blood drawn and collecting their HbA1c levels if they have never done one before. Sometimes the discomfort can last a day or two but often is mild and goes away. If the discomfort persists, we will ask them to contact [CONTACT_3019]. vii. Psychological well-being Psychological discomfort may result from some of the questions in the questionnaires, but participants may choose not to answer questions if they feel uncomfortable. Additionally, participants may feel uncomfortable sharing in the group setting. If they feel uncomfortable, they will be able to communicate with the group leaders, RA, or principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_253654].

Procedures to Minimize Risk Confidentiality: All materials, such as questionnaires and data collected from each participant will be identified by [CONTACT_253669]. Additionally, all researchers will have a thorough understanding of the participants' rights to confidentiality.  Emotional discomfort: Participants will be reminded of their right not to answer specific questions during the research visit. Research assistants will be sensitive to signs of exhaustion or other distress and will schedule breaks or will end the visit as warranted to protect the comfort of participants. All participants will receive information about whom to contact [CONTACT_253670], concerns, or distress regarding any aspect of the study.  Beck Depression Inventory: The Beck Depression Inventory will be included as one of our study surveys. Once this survey is filled out by a participant, the study team will check all responses, specifically question #9 that addresses suicidal ideation. If anything above a “0” is answered, the study team will follow appropriate procedures and talk with the participant. The study team has undergone crisis management training and been given a crisis protocol sheet that includes questions to assess the severity of the suicidal ideation with the participant. This protocol contains a resourcing tool and steps that the participant can take if future suicidal ideation occurs. We will also provide a counseling referral list with contacts in the Palo Alto area.  All research staff have completed and will maintain rigorous training in the protection of human subjects, including CITI training.

BENEFITS Participants, in both the Project Health groups and the educational control, may experience a reduction in weight gain and an improvement in glycemic control. Thus, we anticipate that participants will show improvements in both mental and physical health, but that improvements will be greater for intervention verses educational control participants. If the Project Health is found to be effective there is justification to test it on a larger scale and hopefully implement it broadly among this high-risk population. 11. PRIVACY AND CONFIDENTIALITY

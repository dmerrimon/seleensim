1. PURPOSE OF THE STUDY AND BACKGROUND  
 1.[ADDRESS_1116988] of doxycycline is nausea and vomiting, with reported rates as high as 30-40%
3. Nausea and vomiting may b e reduced by 
[CONTACT_808188]4. Doxycycline given on an empty stomach the morning 
of a surgical pregnancy termi nation resulted in nausea and vomiting in 50% of 
patients and this rate was decreased to 15% when it was taken with food the night before surgery
5. It is not known whether the use of scheduled prophyla ctic anti -
emetics prior to doxycycline use would further reduce the rate of associated nausea and vomiting. The goal of our proposed study is to determine this.  
 
Our study will be a double blinded randomized controlled trial that will examine whether the use of scheduled prophylactic anti -emetics prior to doxycycline use 
reduces the incidence of associated nausea and vomiting. Nausea and vomiting is distressing to patients and it affects their perioperative care. It is well documented that minor gynecologic procedures, such as uterine evacuations, can be performed safely with moderate and deep sedation without an endotracheal tube
6. At our institution, 
patients experiencing nausea and vomiting prior to a surgical procedure receive 
RSRB00056271 Version Date : 06/22/[ADDRESS_1116989] antibiotic efficacy due to reduced serum levels. Reeves’ et al. showe d lower 
serum doxycycline levels in patients with emesis within one hour of doxycycline administration. A serum level greater than 0.8 mg/L has been shown to provide adequate antibiotic prophylaxis. Vomiting after ingestion of doxycycline decreased serum levels by [CONTACT_5554] 0.26 mg/L
5.  
 
Reducing the rates of nausea and vomiting in patients undergoing minor gynecologic procedures may increase the efficacy of antibiotic prophylaxis, and decrease the rates of general anesthesia, patient risks and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_15680]. Most importantly, decreased nausea and vomiting will certainly improve patient experience and is clinically relevant because doxycycline is an antibiotic commonly used for many gynecologic procedures.  
  
2. STUDY DESIGN 
 
2.1 Overview  
This will be a randomized controlled trial. Data will be collected by [CONTACT_808189] a demographic questionnaire and  a baseline visual analog scale rating their 
nausea, pain and anxiety at their clinic appointment 1 -2 days prior to their procedure. 
Patients will then take either ondansetron or a placebo 30 minutes prior to taking doxycycline the night before their procedure . They will then fill out a 
symptom/medication log  recording thei r symptoms from the time that they take the 
study medication to the time that they  present for their procedure . When they present 
for their procedure, patients  will fill out a  second identical visual analog scale rating 
nausea, pain and anxiety . The primary outcome is nausea and vomiting after taking 
the study drug and doxycycline the night prior to surgery. Doxycycline prophylaxis the night prior to surgery is the current standard of care. Eligible patients will be 
enrolled over the course of two years. 
 
2.2 Rationale for Study Design 
A randomized controlled trial was selected in order to  study ondansetron’s effect on 
the rates of  nausea and vomiti ng in our particular population, so that patient’s will not 
know if they are being given ondansetron or placebo before taking doxycycline. 
Some potential barriers that are expected in the study include that the patients may not fill out their symptom/medication  log as this will be  done at home. There are 
approximately 450 patients undergoing surgical termination of pregnancy at the 
RSRB00056271 Version Date : 06/22/[ADDRESS_1116990] Characteristics  
 
3.1.1 Number of Subjects: 320 total subjects are expected to participate in the 
study. 160 total subjects will be randomized to receive ondansetron, while 160 
total subjects will be randomized to receive placebo.  
3.1.2 Gender and Age of Subjects:  Patients included in the study will be pregnant 
females that are ages 18 -45 years old.  
3.1.3 Racial and Ethnic Origin: There will be no racial or ethnic restrictions to 
participation.  
3.1.4 Vulnerable Subjects: The women included in this study will be pregnant, 
although the study intervention s are survey s and  the administration of a 
medication that is both safe in pregnancy and commonly used in pregnancy, ondansetron.  
 
3.2 Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria  
 3.2.1 Inclusion Criteria:  
- Pregnant women seeking care at the Unive rsity of [COMPANY_002]ster’s 
Women’s Health Practice Family Planning Clinic  
- Ages 18-45 years old 
- Undergoing second trimester surgical termination of pregnancy 
- Proficient in reading, writing, and comprehending English 
- Able to give informed consent 
3.2.2 Exclusion Criteria:  
- Less than [ADDRESS_1116991] of care when they present for abortion care.  
 
RSRB00056271 Version Date : 06/22/[ADDRESS_1116992] Identification and Recruitment  
Patients presenting for a surgical termination of pregnancy at Women’s Health 
Practice will be offered the opportunity to participate in the study , after they have 
consented for a pregnancy termination. The investigators offering participation to patients would otherwise have routine contact [CONTACT_808190], as they will be caring for them regardless of whether or not they participate in the study. If a subject is interested in participating, they will then be screened to determine if they are 
eligible. Patients will be assigned a random number for the study that will link 
together their demographic  questionnaire, the two visual analog scales , their study 
drug, and their symptom/medication log. 
 
4.[ADDRESS_1116993] of care, and is not part of the study procedure.  Randomization scheme will be generated by [CONTACT_808191] a 1:[ADDRESS_1116994] Gestational Age at Procedure Date (weeks/days) , Cervical Preparation  
(Miffepristone Y/N) (Misoprostol Y/N) (Cervical Dilators Y/N, IF Y, How Many?)  Genetic Indication for Termination? (Y/N) . 
RSRB00056271 Version Date : 06/22/2018  5  
 The patients will then be given a symptom /medication  log to take home. The patients will 
use the log to recor d symptoms they experience from the time they take the ondansetron 
or placebo to the time that they p resent for their procedure. The log will include the 
timing of the study medication, doxycycline, whether the doxycycline was taken with 
food (and the time of/type of food if applicable), pain medications, and misoprostol. The log will also  include the time of nausea and vomiting, and the severity of the nausea and 
pain (if applicable).   When patients present to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_808186], the study coordinator, [CONTACT_808198],  [CONTACT_808199], or [CONTACT_808200] will give them a second visual 
analog scale to fill out which asks them to rate their nausea, pain and anxiety . This scale 
will be identical to the one they filled out at their clinic visit.  This scale will be filled out 
prior to their procedure. When the IV is placed for their procedure, a nurse will also draw a single 7 mL tube of blood; there are no additional needle sticks for this blood draw. The blood sample will later be tested for doxycycline serum levels.  
 
5.1 Safety Assessments 
A comprehensive medical history will be obtained at the patient’s clinic visit, and a 
physical exam will be performed as well to ensure that patients are not only fit and able to undergo their procedure, but also to participate in the study. 
 
5.[ADDRESS_1116995] Compliance  
Compliance with the demographic questionnaire and baseline visual analog scale will be assessed by [CONTACT_808192]. Compliance with taking the study medication will be assessed by [CONTACT_808193]. Compliance with completing the symptom/medication log will be assess ed 
by [CONTACT_808194]. Compliance with the second visual analog scale will be ensured by [CONTACT_808195][INVESTIGATOR_808187]. 
 
5.3 Data & Specimen Banking for Future Research Use 
Blood samples that will be obtained from subjects on the morning of their procedure 
will be kept for future research use. The subjects have their blood drawn routinely the morning of their procedure as a standard of care in order to obtain a complete blood count and type and screen. Blood samples will be stored for the purpose of potentially comparing serum levels of doxycycline in the future. The samples will be stored in a secure location at the University of [COMPANY_002]ster. the Study Co ordinator, [CONTACT_808201], [CONTACT_808199] and  [CONTACT_808198] will have access to the samples. 
The samples will not be released to invest igators outside the study team. The samples 
will be stored for 5 years and will be destroyed after that. The samples will be coded 
to allow subjects to be identified  so as to potentially correlate their reported 
nausea/vomiting scales to serum levels of doxycycline. S ubjects may withdraw the 
sample at any time should they choose to. They simply must contact [CONTACT_808196]00056271 Version Date : 06/22/[ADDRESS_1116996] of care (and irrespective of the research study), in addition to 
doxycycline, patients will take [ADDRESS_1116997] of care that p atients are able to take either Ibuprofen or 
Tylenol #[ADDRESS_1116998] to do so, or if they fail to take the study medication or the doxycycline. They will not be withdrawn if they fail to complete the demographic questionnaire, the baseline visual analog scale, the symptom/medication log , or the second visual analog scale. In the event that a patient 
does not complete one of these forms, The Study Coordinator will help her complete them. No additional study activities will be completed prior to subject withd rawal.  
 
8. STUDY DRUG ADMINISTRATION/ASSIGNMENT  
 8.[ADDRESS_1116999] Enrollment/Randomization 
Subjects will be randomized to receive either ondansetron or placebo. They will be 
assigned via simple random allocation through the use of a computer software 
program that generates a random sequence.  
 
8.[ADDRESS_1117000] will be responsible for receipt, 
storage, dispensing, collection, accountability and disposal of the inve stigational 
RSRB00056271 Version Date : 06/22/[ADDRESS_1117001]’s envelope should 
occur  only in the case of a medical emergency. If such action is necessary, the 
pharmacist will reveal whether the subject received ondansetron or placebo, and this 
in turn will be revealed to the subject. Subjects will not be withdrawn from the study 
should drug disclosure occur. 
 
9. SAFETY AND REPORTABLE EVENTS  
9.1 Adverse Event Definition  
An adverse event is any symptom, sign, illness, or experience which develops or worsens during the course of the study, whether or not the event is considered related to the study survey.  
9.2 Serious Adverse Event  
A serious adverse event is defined as any adverse medical experience that results in any of the following outcomes: 
- death;  
- is life -threatening;  
- requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081];  
- results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity;  
- is a congenital anomaly/birth defect; or 
- requires medical or surgical intervention to prevent permanent impairment or damage.  
 
9.[ADDRESS_1117002] completes the study (1 -2 days after signing the consent) 
or withdraws from participation.  
RSRB00056271 Version Date : 06/22/[ADDRESS_1117003] completes the study or withdraws from participation. 
 
10. RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSMENT  
 
10.1  Risk Category: Greater than m inimal risk . 
 
10.2  Potential Risks  
Potentia l risks to subjects include the possibility of an adverse reaction to 
ondansetron (including headache, fatigue, malaise, constipation, drowsiness, 
sedation, dizziness, agitation, anxiety, paresthesia, sensation of cold, pruritus, skin rash, diarrhe a, urinary retention, increased serum ALT, increased serum AST, 
hypoxia, and fever ). Important or life -threatening side effects occurring in less than  
1% of patients include abdominal pain, accommodation disturbance, atrial 
fibrillatio n, depression of ST segment on ECG, dyspnea, flushing, hepatic failure 
(when used with other hepatotoxic medications), hiccups, hypersensitivity reaction, hypokalemia, hypotension, liver enzyme disorder, mucosal tissue reaction, myocardial infarction, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, positive lymphocyte 
transformation test, prolonged Q-T interval on ECG (dose dependent), second-degree atrioventricular block , serotonin syndrome , Stevens -Johnson syndrome, 
supraventricular tachycardia, syncope, tachycardia, tonic- clonic seizures, torsades 
de pointes, transient blindness (lasted ≤48 hours), vascular occlusive events, ventricular premature contractions, ventricular tachycardia, and weakness
10. There 
is also a  potential risk of a patient’s greater realization of the nausea and vomit ing 
they are experiencing due to doxycycline. The use of doxycycline is already standard of care.  
 
10.[ADDRESS_1117004] of care at our clinic for termination of pregnancy, which involves the use of doxycycline as a prophylactic antibiotic the night before the procedure, as well as misoprostol the morning of the procedure. They will also be able to take Ibuprofen or Tylenol #3 for pain. They wil l not fill out any surveys  or logs or take the study drug. 
 
11. CONFIDENTIALITY OF DATA AND INFORMATION STORAGE  
RSRB00056271 Version Date : 06/22/[ADDRESS_1117005] data will be identified in the research data set by [CONTACT_808197].  The Study Coordinator will maintain the code to that information and it will be used to re-identify patients when they present for their procedure, in order to link together 
their demographic questionnaire, the two visual analog scales, their study medication, and the symptom/medication log. The research data will be secured in a locked filing 
cabinet  during the study. No identifying information will be included in the research 
database except for the subject’s ID number, any identifying information will be kept separately from the research database. Research files will be locked up when they are 
unsupervised, and only The Study Coordinator , [CONTACT_808202] tadt, or [CONTACT_808203] will be able to access the files .  
 
12. RESEARCH INFORMATION IN MEDICAL RECORDS  
No research data will be included in the subject’s medical record.  
 
13. DATA ANALYSIS AND MONITORING  
13.1 Sample Size Determination  
Based on Reeves’ study as well as anecdotal data from our clinic population, we expect vomiting to occur in approximately 30 % of our patients who take their 
doxycycline the night before their procedure. To have 80% power to detect a 50% decrease in nausea and vomiting, we will need [ADDRESS_1117006] withdrawal or non-compliance, we intend to enroll 150 patients in each arm of the study.  This will be a total of 300 subjects. 
 
13.2 Planned Statistical Analysis  
Our primary outcome of vomiting, will be analyzed using chi- square analysis.  All 
dichotomous outcomes will be analyzed using chi -square analysis.  Continuous 
variables will be examined using t-tests.  If demographic variables are found to be 
confounders with significance, they will be placed into a logistic regression model.  SPSS software will be used for statistical analysis.

1.Statement of Purpose: State the scientific aim(s) of the study, or the hypotheses to be  tested.
This is a four week, randomized, p lacebo controlled, crossover trial comparing cannabidiol 
(CBD) to placebo in outpatients w ith psychotic disorder within their first five years of disease 
onset. We hypothesize that treatment with CBD will result in:
a.Primary Hypotheses:
i.Improvement evidenced b y a reduction in scores on the Positive and Negative 
Syndrome Scale for Schizophrenia (PANSS).
ii.Improvement evidenced by a reduction in the  Clinical Global Impression of Severity 
scale (CGI).
b.Secondary Hypothesis:
i.Greater improvement in functioning  as measured on the “Patient Assessment of Own 
Functioning Inventory: (PAOFI) and the Quality of Life Scale (QLS)
ii.No worsening of depressive symptoms or suicidality as measured on the CDSS and 
CSSRS.
c.Exploratory Hypotheses:
i.Exploration of the effect of CBD on EEG recordings of MMN and P300  amplitude 
and latency, known endophenotypes/biomarkers of Schizophrenia
2.Background: Describe the background information that led to the plan for this p roject. 
Provide references to support  the expectation of obtaining useful scientific data.
There is a n eed to develop a nti-psychotic therapeutics with n ovel mechanisms of action and 
fewer side effects:
Current first and second  generation anti-psychotics  employ a common mechanism of dopamine 
receptor antagonism leading to varying  degrees of motor side effects and QTc prolongation for 
the class as a whole. Second g eneration anti-psychotics h ave also been  demonstrated to cause 
significant metabolic side effects including weight gain, dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], and diabetes mellitus [1- 
3]. S pecifically, the CATIE study found the prevalence of metabolic syndrome  in schizophrenia 
to be 42% compared to 23% in the general population  [4]. Given the significant morbidity and 
mortality associated with schizophrenia, even appropriate treatment with the currently available 
medications has the potential  to add serious medical illness to an already  poor prognosis [4, 5]. 
Thus, it is i mperative that new antipsychotics with novel mechanisms of action be developed not 
only to find m ore tolerable therapi[INVESTIGATOR_873604] p atients with incomplete response and potentially those with p sychotic symptoms 
derived from  neurodegenerative disease [6].
Cannabidiol, a component of herbal cannabis, may have antipsychotic effects via a n ovel 
mechanism of action:
Cannabidiol is a component of herbal cannabis, studied for a number of potential p harmaceutical 
indications since the 1970s g iven its p urported hypnotic, a nticonvulsant, neuroprotective and 
hormonal effects [7-10].   More recently, enthusiasm h as mounted surrounding its potential as an 
anti-psychotic and anxiolytic. Initially thought to be a CB-[ADDRESS_1220187], the mechanism of action

APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 5/17/2017 VALID THROUGH 5/6/2018Page [ADDRESS_1220188] been s uggested including modulation of the endocannabinoid system via FAAH inhibition 
leading to increased levels of the endogenous cannabinoid, anandamide, TRPV1  activation, 5- 
HT1A agonism, and NMDA  receptor modulation [11-13]. O verall, the true mechanism of action 
remains unknown.  Studies have proposed  that alterations in the endocannabinoid s ystem, 
manifesting as significantly elevated levels of anandamide in the cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_873605], may suggest a  protective role of this c ompound against psychosis, one 
that cannabidiol may modulate in therapeutically significant ways not yet fully understood. Brain 
imaging studies also demonstrate opposite  effects of CBD and THC in  particular brain r egions 
thought to be associated with the development of psychosis.  Specifically, fMRI  studies have 
demonstrated CBD’s augmentation of activity in the right posterior temporal gyrus, the left 
caudate and the hippocampus a s well as attenuated activity in the right prefrontal area, all of 
which are the opposite  of THC effects [14].  D espi[INVESTIGATOR_873606], c linical studies in both h uman and animal models have suggested 
antipsychotic effects as discussed b elow, with an extremely favorable side effect profile.
Cannabidiol has been shown to exhibit antipsychotic effects:
Within the last decade, animal m odels have demonstrated CBD’s ability  to decrease 
hyperlocomotion induced b y amphetamine and ketamine and to extinguish stereotyped behavior 
induced by [CONTACT_873627] [10, 15]. H uman case studies also suggested antipsychotic 
effects of CBD in patients u nable to tolerate or unresponsive to usual therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. While  the exact 
mechanism of action r emains unknown, more recent  clinical studies have demonstrated that pre- 
treatment with CBD inhibits the  psychotomimetic effects of THC resulting in  a significant 
decrease in self-reported paranoia and a non-statistically significant trend t oward decreased 
PANSS scores [16]. I ndeed, a high ratio of THC to CBD has been  correlated with increased risk 
of psychotic symptoms further suggesting a protective role of CBD, a t least a mong cannabis 
users [17, 18].
Perhaps most  encouraging was a  recent clinical trial by [CONTACT_873628], et al. which showed similar 
reduction in PANSS scores in patients treated with CBD versus the D2/D3 antagonist 
amisulpride [11].  In this double blind p arallel group randomized active controlled clinical trial, 
men and women aged 18-50 w ith acute exacerbation of schizophrenia or schizophreniform 
psychosis received four week courses of either cannabidiol or  amisulpride with recording of 
baseline, day 14 and day 28 PANSS scores. Side effects were also measured using the 
Extrapyramidal Symptom Scale. Results revealed a similar reduction in PANSS scores in both 
groups, no difference in the percentage of responders and significantly  fewer extrapyramidal side 
effects in the CBD group. This promising evidence for likely non-inferiority of CBD warrants 
replication as well a s investigation of its use outside the acute stage and in the outpatient setting, 
which the proposed study intends to investigate.  Furthermore, the addition of  objective outcome 
measurements including p sychosocial, cognitive, mood,  and biomarker data as well as the use of 
a wider range of cannabidiol dosages would contribute to the overall pi[INVESTIGATOR_873607]’s use as a 
novel anti-psychotic.
Cannabidiol has few side effects and is generally well  tolerated:
Based on earlier studies of the 1970s,  Cunha  et al. d emonstrated that 300-400mg  daily  doses of 
cannabidiol for 30 days in healthy subjects a s well as 100-200mg daily for 4.5 months in s ubjects 
with epi[INVESTIGATOR_873608] s omnolence [19, 2 0]. High doses of the

APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 5/17/2017 VALID THROUGH 5/6/2018Page 11 of 40medication were also well t olerated in case studies of use in patients unable to tolerate or 
resistant to dopamine antagonists and in doses up to 10mg/kg (average of 700mg) daily for 6 
weeks in patients with Huntington’s Disease and in combination with alcohol [21-23].
Specifically, analysis of reported side effects in the  latter study showed no significant difference 
between placebo and CBD [22]. Also, in the aforementioned trial comparing anti-psychotic 
effects of CBD and amisulpride, patients treated with cannabidiol had a significantly fewer 
extrapyramidal symptoms, less weight gain, and lower prolactin levels [11].
Individuals early in their course of illness may particularly benefit from treatment with a 
medication such as cannabidiol:
In treatment settings caring for patients with early psychosis, ~30% drop out of care within the 
first year which  may be related to unwillingness to tolerate medication side effects associated 
with dopaminergic antipsychotic medications. As discussed above, CBD  is very well tolerated 
and may thus be a suitable choice especially  in early  psychosis when patients  are medication 
naïve and more sensitive  to the side effects. Furthermore, these individuals typi[INVESTIGATOR_873609] (~30%) in this c ohort, which is associated with worsening of symptoms, 
course and engagement with treatment. CBD, in laboratory  studies has been s hown to attenuate 
the effects of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main psychoactive component of cannabis 
and may potentially have benefits in this  population. Furthermore, since CBD is known to be a 
component of cannabis, patients may have  fewer reservations about accepting this a s a treatment.
Thus, given some evidence supporting the antipsychotic potential of CBD, its effects on non- 
specific symptoms  such as anxiety and insomnia and its favorable side effect profile, further 
study of CBD’s anti-psychotic effects may benefit from inclusion of more objective measures 
such as Event Related Potentials (ERPs).
ERPs are oscillatory brain r esponses seen on E EG triggered by [CONTACT_873629]. N umerous 
studies have demonstrated aberrations in event-related potentials in schizophrenia, specifically 
deficient mismatch negativity  (MMN) and significantly decreased P300 amplitude and latency 
which are hypothesized to  serve as indices of abnormal auditory sensory  memory, information 
processing speed and allocation of attention ([24-26]. A  recent study by [CONTACT_3493], et al. 
demonstrated both a  correlation between decreased  MMN  and increased PANSS s cores as well 
as a correlation between decreased P300 a mplitude and increased auditory  hallucinations [25]. 
Attenuation of the MMN and decreased P300 m easures have thus been s uggested as 
endophenotypes of schizophrenia and potential biomarkers of disease  [24, 27]. S tudies assessing 
the effects of medications on the MMN and P300  are limited.  While  clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_873610] P300 a mplitude, first generation anti-psychotics a nd olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_873611] [28, 2 9]. However, further research on the use of biomarkers to assess m edication effect is 
needed and collection of this d ata will shed light on the potential role of antipsychotics and CBD 
in particular on normalizing these processes.
Significance:
As outlined above, CBD has shown potential anti-psychotic effect via novel m echanisms of 
action as compared to the currently available drugs. CBD is likely to have an extremely  
favorable side effect profile.  There is a need  for novel a nti-psychotics both to expand upon the 
currently available, effective battery of therapeutics and to limit the medical comorbidity  
associated with current therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].

water. Once successfully  trained in the clinic, the subjects w ill be loaned the phone to take home  
for one trial CAROMA visit. T his is to e nsure that 1) the in-clinic training extends  to the home, 
and 2) that the subject has adequate cellular service  at home. Within a time period predetermined 
by [INVESTIGATOR_73261], subjects will be called on the cell phone and will be observed r emoving study 
medication from the packaging a nd swallowing the medication. The research assistant will log 
visual confirmation of compliance. Subjects will receive additional compensation for CAROMA 
visits a s outlined in the “Economic Considerations” section below. Subjects w ho are not

missed CAROMA visits.
Finally, compliance will also be confirmed by [CONTACT_873633].
Study Procedures:
Safety Assessment: during each visit. T his will include assessment of psychiatric status, 
assessment of adverse events, vital signs, and safety  labs (CBC, C hem 19, u rinalysis, and urine 
toxicology).
Outcome measures:
1.Positive and N egative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) (Visits I-VI): The PANSS i ncludes 3 
scales and 30 items: 7 items t hat make up the Positive Scale (eg, delusions,  conceptual 
disorganization, hallucinatory behavior); 7 i tems that make up the Negative Scale (eg, 
blunted affect, emotional withdrawal, poor rapport, passive/apathetic social  withdrawal); and 
16 items that make up the General Psychopathology Scale (eg, somatic concern, anxiety, 
guilt feelings, mannerisms and posturing, motor retardation, uncooperativeness, 
disorientation, poor impulse control, preoccupation). Individual items are scored with values 
ranging from 1 to 7.
2.Personal and S ocial Performance Scale  (PSP) (Visits I-VI): The PSP scale is a validated 
clinician-related scale that measures personal and social f unctioning in the  domains o f: 
socially useful a ctivities (eg, work and study), personal and social relationships, self-care, 
disturbing and aggressive behaviors. Information from the subject and the informant will be 
utilized in d etermining the rating. The interview with the informant may be conducted by 
[CONTACT_873634]-person interview has o ccurred and informed consent h as been 
obtained.
3.Clinical Global Impression (CGI) (Visits I-VI):
a.Clinical Global Impression of Severity (CGI-S): The CGI-S consists of a single 7- 
point r ating score  of illness s everity. Raters  select one response based on the 
following question, “Considering your total clinical experience with this p articular 
population, how mentally ill is your patient  at this time?” Scores are: 1, N ormal, not

Severely ill; or 7, Among the most  severely  ill subjects.
b.Clinical Global Impression of Improvement (CGI-I): The CGI-I consists of a 
single 7-point rating  score  total improvement, regardless of whether or not the change 
it is due entirely to drug treatment. Raters select one response based on the following 
question, “Compared to your patient’s condition at the beginning of treatment, how 
much has your patient changed?” Scores are: 1, V ery much improved; 2, Much 
improved; 3, Minimally improved; 4, N o change; 5, Minimally  worse; 6, Much 
worse; or 7, Very much worse. For the CGI-I Scale, t he subject’s condition at the 
Day 1 (Baseline) visit will be the criterion for judging improvement at 
subsequent visits.
4. Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (CSSRS) (Visits I-VI): The CSSRS is  an 
interview based rating scale to systematically assess s uicidal ideation and suicidal behavior. 
Versions are available for Screening/Baseline and follow-up visits.
5. Quality of Life Scale (QLS) (Visits II-VI): The QLS is a structured interview providing 
clinician ratings of function in key areas of everyday living.
6. The Patient Assessment of Own Functioning Inventory: (PAOFI) (Visits II-VI): will be 
included as a subjective assessment of cognitive functioning. The PAOFI is a widely used 
self-report instrument that taps into the respondent’s own views and experiences regarding 
difficulty in everyday  functioning.
7. Motor side effect scales (Visits I-VI): Barnes Akathisia Scale, Simpson A ngus Scale, and 
the AIMS; Further, the [LOCATION_006]U side effects scale will be administered at weekly visits  to 
assess for antipsychotic induced  side effects.
8. Metabolic parameters (Visits I, II, I V, VI): Appetite and food intake ratings (VAS) and 
three day dietary record (which have been  shown to be predictors of energy intake and 
weight loss [30]),  weight, fasting glucose and lipid p rofile.
9. Smoking and C annabis use (Visits I-VI): Past week Time Line Follow Back approach.
10. EEG testing: The main EEG outcome measures will be P50, P300 a nd ASSR as discussed 
above. Brain wave  activity  during tasks involved in the processing auditory and visual 
stimuli w ith different degrees of attentional and memory  demands w ill be recorded. 
Auditory stimuli w ill include tones, white noise bursts, o ther digitized sounds ( such as dog 
barks, rooster crows), or spoken words. Visual stimuli  will include letters, numbers, words, 
geometric shapes, c olored patterns, or photographic images. Some  audiovisual stimuli may 
have emotive/emotionally salient or neutral content. S timuli will be separated by [CONTACT_479271]

booth. In the EEG recording, an elastic cloth cap with Ag/AgCl electrodes is worn by [CONTACT_1560]. A conductive gel is then placed between the skin a nd the electrode prior to 
recording. The subject will t hen listen to sounds  or view visual images produced by a 
computer. By [CONTACT_873635], different 
brain systems are activated. In some recordings, the subject will be asked to press a button 
to indicate what sort of stimulation he or she experienced. The EEG recordings will be 
obtained using  a commercial psychophysiological system. The entire EEG procedure will 
take approximately 1.5 hours.
EEGs will be recorded at a sampling rate of 1024 Hz with on-line low-pass filter of 256Hz 
to prevent aliasing of high f requencies. A 64-channel  electrode cap according to the 
extended 10-20 system will be utilized. Seven additional electrodes will be placed: two on 
the mastoid processes, two h orizontal EOG channels lateral to the left and right eyes’ lateral 
canthi, two vertical EOG  channels, one below  (infraorbital) and one above  (supraorbital) the 
right eye, and a channel on the  tip of the nose. All electrodes will be referenced during 
recording to a common-mode signal (CMS) electrode between POz and PO3 and will be 
subsequently re-referenced digitally. A conductive gel will be placed between the skin and 
the electrodes prior to recording. The cap and all electrodes that come into c ontact with the 
skin w ill be cleaned and disinfected after each use in an antibacterial soap, which kills 
almost all vegetative microbial and viral life forms.
The main dependent measures of the EEG portion  of the study will be traditional EEG 
waveform amplitude and latency. Secondary measures will be EEG spectral power, inter- 
electrode coherence, and inter-trial coherence.
11. CBD and E ndocannabinoid Levels: Blood will be drawn at visit  II-VI for plasma CBD 
and Anandamide levels.  CBD levels will be assayed by [CONTACT_301407], Thomas C ooper, at 
Nathan Kline Institute. Serum Anandamide levels will be assayed by [CONTACT_301407], Alex 
Makriyannis, Director, Center for Drug  discovery at Northeastern University.
12. Neuropsychological Testing (Visits I, II,  and V I): A cognitive battery  will be utilized to 
assess working memory, spatial working memory, epi[INVESTIGATOR_10682], and learning.
Drug Dose and A dministration: CBD will be used u nder IND# [ADDRESS_1220194] as per package 
instructions. The investigators brochure from Insys Pharmaceuticals is submitted along with this 
application. Pharmacists will deliver medication vials to study staff for dispensing by [CONTACT_636053]. The daily dose for this study is CBD 800mg in an oral solution. T his dose has been 
previously shown to be well tolerated in healthy  subjects as well as schizophrenia patients in a 
recent clinical trial of 42 patients who were treated  with CBD 800 mg vs. Amisulpi[INVESTIGATOR_873612] 4

7.How will eligibility be determined, and by [CONTACT_20898]?
Subjects may first undergo a phone screen to initially determine eligibility. Information 
collected during the phone  screen will only  be used in the event that the subject c ontinues to 
participate in the  study.
After determining initial eligibility, research staff will provide a brief description  of the 
research and the subject will present to the  clinic for the screening procedures described 
above. Once  all screening  procedures have been collected, research staff as well as the 
principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_215977], based on the 
inclusion and exclusion  criteria, if the subject w ill continue with the remaining study 
procedures. Subjects already on antipsychotics or other medications will continue use of the 
medications while participating in the  current study.  Subjects will not be taken o ff their 
antipsychotic medications f or participation in this s tudy.
8.Risks: Participation in this study may be associated w ith risks related to:

APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 5/17/2017 VALID THROUGH 5/6/2018Page 19 of 40a.Psychiatric evaluation: Subjects will undergo a Structured Clinical Interview for 
DSM-IV conducted by a research assistant and a psychiatric and medical evaluation 
during screening. The diagnostic interviews may cover issues, which are stressful to a 
person, for example, questions regarding the experience of paranoid thoughts or social 
isolation. Thus, they  may experience some distress during these interviews.
b.Loss of  confidentiality: Participation in research may involve a loss of privacy and 
confidentiality. Therefore, extensive measures are in place to protect the 
confidentiality of subjects. ( See below.)
c.Study assessments: During the baseline  and follow-up assessments, study participants 
may become tired or frustrated. If this o ccurs, they will be encouraged to take breaks. 
It is also possible that some individuals may  experience discomfort during  the 
interviews, when they are asked to talk about their psychiatric symptoms.  Subjects 
may feel bored, t ired, exhausted, discouraged or distressed by [CONTACT_873636].
d.CBD administration: CBD  is a naturally  occurring component of cannabis t hat has 
been used recreationally and for medicinal purposes b y large populations. As 
mentioned above, studies have shown good tolerance of cannabidiol even in high 
doses with relatively  few side effects and no known s evere events. Sedation and/or 
lightheadedness are likely  to be the most c ommon reported adverse reaction.  Patient 
will be assessed weekly for the development of side effects.
e.Worsening of psychosis: Participation in this  study may be associated with worsening 
of psychosis especially in those individuals who are not on a ny other antipsychotics. 
Subjects will be evaluated on a  weekly  basis in f ace-to-face meeting with study staff. 
Psychotic symptoms, mood s ymptoms and suicidality  will be assessed at each of these 
meetings. Further, subjects w ill be contact[CONTACT_41576] [ADDRESS_1220197] w ill be asked to come into the 
clinic to be evaluated if clinically indicated. Subjects are well aware that in case of 
significant worsening  of symptoms/ emergence of SI/HI, they may be escorted to  the 
ER or admitted to an inpatient unit.
f.Risk of blood d raws: Blood will be drawn weekly during  the study to monitor  
medication levels as well a s safety labs. There are usually  no serious m edical problems 
with blood d rawing, but there may be pain at the venipuncture site or bruising or 
infection may occur.
g.Risks of EEG: EEG is a non-invasive assessment. There are minimal risks associated 
with EEG/ERP recording. Traditionally, scalp a brasion has been used to  improve

a high-impedance system and does not r equire scalp a brasion to obtain clean 
recording. A conductive gel is applied, which c an be easily washed out of the subject’s 
hair with warm water. A shower facility for hair washing and s terile linens are 
available in the  laboratory. Electrode caps and sensors  will be washed and sterilized  
between subjects to minimize the risk of transmitting infection.
Potential benefits: Subjects will receive no direct  benefit from this study.  Potential benefits 
may include improvement in psychotic and cognitive symptoms, decreased negative symptoms, 
avoidance of potential side effects from usual a nti-psychotic medications themselves or from 
dose increases of such medications.  Overall, the development of novel anti-psychotics will 
provide benefit to the schizophrenia population as a whole.
Risk/Benefit ratio: As described above, the primary  risks of this study are related to CBD 
administration and are low.  E xtensive safety measures are  in place to ensure that participants 
with worsening psychosis or mood s ymptoms are identified expeditiously. The overall risk- 
benefit ratio is therefore favorable.
9.Minimizing Risks: Describe the manner in which the above-mentioned risks will be 
minimized.
Loss of Confidentiality: There is a risk of loss of confidentiality in this study. All subject 
information will be kept confidential and only members of the investigative team with appropriate 
IRB/HIC and HIPAA training will have access to the study data.  Data will be maintained and s ecured 
in locked file cabinets or password protected electronic media. A numbering code will be used to 
assign a unique identifier to each subject. The researchers will be applying for a certificate of 
confidentiality (COC).
For the Cellphone Assisted Remote Observation of M edication Adherence (CAROMA) 
procedures, subjects will be called and observed while taking study medications. The 
CAROMA procedure is not recorded, broadcast, nor will the likeness of the subjects be used 
for anything other than what h as been specified. The potential for loss of confidentiality is if 
someone taps the phone while a call is being made, but this risk is no different from someone 
tappi[INVESTIGATOR_28059] a phone (audio) conversation between the subject and the research team. The 
phones used for this practice will be encrypted by [CONTACT_873637] (ITS) so that loss of confidentiality is minimized. CAROMA was set up with input 
from Yale ITS in order to conform to Yale’s policies.
Psychiatric Evaluation and S tudy Assessments: If subjects become tired, frustrated, or 
distressed during assessments or evaluations, they will be encouraged to take breaks.
CBD Administration: Patients w ill be assessed weekly for the development of side effects. 
Worsening of psychosis: Subjects will be evaluated on a  weekly basis in  face-to-face meeting  
with study staff. Psychotic  symptoms, mood s ymptoms, and suicidality will be assessed at each 
of these meetings. Further, subjects will be contact[CONTACT_41576] [ADDRESS_1220198] noticed any worsening of symptoms or any new side effects. If subjects r eport

emergence of SI/HI, they may be escorted to the ER or admitted to an inpatient unit.
Risks of Blood D raws: Due to the risks associated with phlebotomy procedures, subjects who 
have donated blood within eight weeks to the present study will be excluded. S ubjects will be 
told t hat they should  not g ive blood for at least eight w eeks.
Risks of EEG: The risk of irritation during EEG set up w ill be minimized through careful 
application of electrodes and appropriate cleansing of the skin b y trained technicians.
10.Data and S afety Monitoring Plan: Include an appropriate Data  and Safety Monitoring Plan 
(DSMP) based on the investigator’s risk assessment stated below. (Note: the HIC will make

DSMB: A Data Safety Monitoring Board is being assembled for this study. Unblinded safety  
data will be provided to the committee for monitoring purposes, in a meeting that will be held 
approximately every 6 months. DSMB reports will be provided to the HIC. 
11.Statistical Considerations: 
General Strategy:
All outcomes will be summarized descriptively and assessed for normality prior to analysis using 
normal probability plots and Kolmogorov test statistics. Transformations or nonparametric 
analyses will be performed as necessary. All tests will be two-sided and considered statistically 
significant at alpha=.05. Post-hoc comparisons will be performed as appropriate and significance 
levels for secondary analyses will be adjusted for multiple tests using the Bonferroni correction. 
All analyses will be performed using SAS, version 9.3 ( SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).

covariance structure will be selected based on information criteria. The mixed effects approach is 
advantageous in that it is unaffected by [CONTACT_873640] [31]. Similar mixed  models as 
described above will be employed to evaluate secondary outcomes (e.g., PAOFI, EEG parameters).
Power Analysis:
We will recruit 36 subjects and randomly assign 18 to receive either CBD followed by [CONTACT_14296] 
(order 1) or placebo followed by [CONTACT_58649] (order 2). Based on a within-subjects design and a two- 
tailed alpha=0.05, 36 subjects will provide 80% power to detect moderate treatment effects as 
small as d’=0.49. This compares favorably with the effects (d=0.7) observed by [CONTACT_873641][INVESTIGATOR_873615].

1.Identification of Drug, Biologic or Radiotracer: The investigational drug to be used in  this study 
is Cannabidiol provided by [CONTACT_873642]. This study will be conducted under an IND# 
126731.
2.Background Information:
Cannabidiol (CBD) is a component of herbal cannabis that is present in varying concentrations in 
cannabis extracts. CBD has b een shown to produce  central effects including hypnotic, 
anticonvulsive, anxiolytic and neuroprotective effects [10]. U ntil recently, the mechanism of action 
of CBD was u nclear. However, recently, CBD has been found to be  a potent n on-competitive 
inhibitor at CB-1 and CB-2 receptors [32] in addition to having effects at a third a s of yet 
unidentified central cannabinoid G-protein coupled r eceptor.
CBD has also been u sed to treat patients with schizophrenia. Early  case series suggested mixed 
results but g ood tolerability  even at high doses [9]. Preliminary results  from a n SMRI funded 4- 
week, double-blind c omparison of CBD vs. amisulpride in acute schizophrenic and 
schizophreniform psychosis h ave been promising. CBD significantly  reduced a cute psychotic 
symptoms after 2 and 4 weeks of treatment. CBD was equivalent to the amisulpride in efficacy and 
was also associated with fewer side effects [33].

5.Use of Placebo: Not applicable  to this research project
If use of a placebo is planned, provide a justification which addresses the following:
a.The study intervention include CBD or placebo. The inclusion of placebo is to permit 
comparison with CBD. However, we recognize that f or an individual with a psychotic disorder  
the standard of care is treatment with first or second-generation antipsychotic medication. A 
large proportion of individuals w ith early psychosis d iscontinue or never initiate antipsychotic 
treatment due to a number of factors including fear of side effects, stigma etc. T his study CBD 
versus Placebo will recruit a ll individuals. This study will not i nterfere with standard of care 
and will be in addition to treatment as usual. Due to the  prevalent refusal of traditional 
antipsychotic treatment among individuals with early psychosis we anticipate that some  
subjects who will receive CBD/Placebo will be on no other medication. However, requiring 
treatment with traditional antipsychotics or proposing an active control instead  of placebo will 
exclude this p roportion of individuals and in fact result in d ata that is not generalizable to this, 
most v ulnerable population. Safety assessments will be done in person weekly, and multiple 
times during the week over  the phone. Furthermore, subjects will be encouraged to remain 
compliant with their regular treatment sessions and m edications.
There is no a lternative to CBD since its efficacy is unknown. The alternative is not  to 
participate in this t rial.
b.State the maximum total length of time a participant may receive placebo w hile on the study.

6.Use of Controlled Substances:
Will t his research project involve the use of controlled substances in human subjects?
No Yes  See HIC Application Instructions to v iew controlled substance listings.
If yes, is the use of the controlled substance considered:
Therapeutic: The use of the controlled substance, within the context  of the research, has the 
potential to benefit the research participant.
Non-Therapeutic: Note, the use of a c ontrolled substance in a n on-therapeutic research study  
involving human subjects may require that the investigator obtain a L aboratory Research License. 
Examples include controlled substances used for basic  imaging, observation or biochemical 
studies or other non-therapeutic purposes. See Instructions for f urther information.
7.Continuation of Drug Therapy After Study Closure Not applicable to this project
Are subjects provided  the opportunity  to continue to receive the study drug(s) after the study has 
ended?
Yes   If yes, describe the conditions under which continued access to study drug(s) may apply  
as well as conditions for termination of such access.
No
The use of CBD is experimental. At this point t here are no data supporting  its use in the

ii.If requesting a waiver of signed authorization, describe why it would be 
impracticable to obtain the subject’s signed authorization  for use/disclosure of this 
data;
This data will serve to prescreen subjects who meet  obvious exclusion c riteria for the study. 
Thus it avoids subject and investigator burden  related to screening of ineligible subjects.
Further, due to the stringent I/C criteria, the number  of subjects screened who w ill need to go 
through exhaustive  screening and be exposed to g reater risk will increase if all potential 
subjects are to be brought in for a face to face screening.
iii.  Authorization will be obtained prior to subject participation in any  research

9.Process of Consent/Assent: Describe the setting a nd conditions under which c onsent/assent will 
be obtained, including parental permission or surrogate permission and the steps taken to ensure 
subjects’ independent decision-making.
The consent process is a multistep process, whereby [CONTACT_873650]. The number of sessions 
over which this i nformation will be provided will depend on how well the subject understands 
and retains the information. The process begins with the subject initiating contact [CONTACT_96148]. 
The research staff will provide a brief description of the study following which the subject is 
screened by a member of the research team. T hereafter, potentially eligible candidates are 
scheduled for a face-to-face interview. The study procedures will be described as a research tool 
with potential to enhance our knowledge about the brain. Subjects will also be informed of all 
potential risks of participation. Subjects will be required to read the informed consent form and 
the investigator will additionally describe the risks a nd discomforts.
To ensure that the study  subject understands the study, the subject will be asked questions about 
the study procedures and the risks associated with participation. If any concern arises that the 
study subject did not f ully understand the study, the principal investigator (PI) may decide  that 
the subject is not s uitable for participation. This process generally  takes about one hour. If the 
subject is still i nterested after all questions have been a nswered, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_96086], will ask the subject to sign the informed consent form. Any subject who appears 
incapable of providing informed consent  will be excluded.  Subjects will be informed that they 
can decline  to participate in the study without penalty and given the opportunity  to withdraw 
from the study prior  to analysis of their data. Following the resolution of any questions, the 
subjects will be asked to sign the consent  form if he/she agrees to participate.

f.Who w ill have access to the protected health  information (such as the research sponsor, the 
investigator, the research staff, all research monitors, FDA, Yale Cancer Center Data and Safety 
Monitoring Committee (DSMC), SSC, e tc.)? (please distinguish between PHI and de-identified 
data)
All protected health information collected specifically for this research will be secured in the manner 
described above. The data will be stored in a secure location- we anticipate that the data will be 
stored for at least 10-15 years.
g.If appropriate, has a Certificate of Confidentiality  been o btained? 
We have obtained a CoC from the Food and Drug A dministration.
h.Are any of the study procedures likely to yield information subject to mandatory reporting 
requirements? (e.g. HIV testing – reporting of communicable diseases; parent interview -incidents 
of child abuse, elderly  abuse, etc.). Please verify  to whom such instances will need to be reported.
If subjects report any threats of violence to a child or elderly person, this will be reported to the 
Department of Health and Human Services. Threats of violence to self or others will be assessed by 
[CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_873620]. Furthermore, positive 
HIV, hepatitis B, or C results will be reportable to the Connecticut Department of Public Health.
SECTION IX: POTENTIAL BENEFITS
Potential Benefits:
Potential benefits: Subjects will receive no direct benefit from this study. Potential b enefits may 
include improvement in psychotic symptoms,  decreased negative symptoms, a voidance of 
potential side effects from u sual anti-psychotic medications themselves or from dose increases of 
such medications.  Overall, the development of novel anti-psychotics will provide benefit to the 
schizophrenia population as a whole.
Risk/Benefit ratio: As described above,  the primary risks of this study are related to CBD 
administration and are low.  Extensive  safety measures are in place to ensure that participants 
with worsening psychosis or mood s ymptoms are identified expeditiously. The overall risk- 
benefit ratio is therefore favorable.
SECTION X: RESEARCH ALTERNATIVES AND ECONOMIC CONSIDERATIONS
1. Alternatives: What other alternatives are available to the study subjects outside of the research? 
Alternatives include antipsychotics that are currently  used to treat psychosis.

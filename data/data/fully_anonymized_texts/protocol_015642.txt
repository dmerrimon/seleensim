  2.0 OBJECTIVES  
 
2.1 Primary Objectives  
 
Aim 1:  Using our enhanced telehealth techniques, determine if patient activation , self -efficacy, 
ostomy -related knowledge, and HRQOL will be improved and sustained over time in the online 
interactive communication Ostomy Self -Management Telehealth program (OSMT) curriculum 
compared to a usual care (UC) group.  
Hypothesis 1.1:  Taking into account time since surgery:  
1.1.[ADDRESS_1247646] a sustained improvement in patient activation . 
1.1.3  In survivors in the OSMT group, higher attendance levels will be associated with 
increased patient activation . 
Hypothesis 1.2:  Taking into account time since surgery:  
1.2.[ADDRESS_1247647] a sustained improvement in self-efficacy, 
ostomy -related knowledge, and HRQOL . 
1.2.3  In survivors in the OSMT group, higher attendance levels will be associated with 
increased self-efficacy, ostomy -related knowledge, and HRQOL . 
 
2.2 Secondary Objective(s)  
 
Aim 2:  Determine the differences in ostomy -related medical care utilization  and fami ly 
financial burden  imposed on survivors between OSMT and UC groups.  
Hypothesis 2.1:  OSMT telehealth subjects will use fewer ostomy -specific  family resources  
in the 6 months after OSMT compared to UC subjects.  
Hypothesis 2.2:  OSMT telehealth subjects will use fewer ostomy -specific  health care 
services  in the 6 months after OSMT compared to UC subjects.  
Question 2.1:   What is the difference in the overall levels of ostomy -related family financial 
burden  between OSMT and UC grou ps? 
Question 2.2:   What are types and levels of effort of OSMT intervention personnel and 
specific equipment, supplies, and informatics support required to implement and operate a 
successful OSMT program; what are participants’ levels of use of ostomy -spec ific health care 
services and supplies; and what are the time and in -home requirements for participating in 
OSMT for survivors and their family caregivers. This information is required for replicating our 
OSMT intervention in the event that we find it impr oves the primary and secondary outcomes 
of OSMT participants.  
 
 
3.0 BACKGROUND  
An ostomy is the externalization of a tubular structure in the body. In the context of this 
proposal, it relates to intestines externalized to the abdominal wall. It adversely affects health -
related quality of life (HRQOL) in a diverse population of cancer  survivors . For cancer , ostomies 
are most commonly placed for rectal cancers, followed by [CONTACT_891238]. Ostomies  
may be needed for other cancers related to bulky or metastatic disease, or in emergencies. In 
addition, ostomies may be placed on a t emporary or a permanent basis. Temporary ostomies 
may be created in emergencies, such as perforation or obstruction due to tumor, or in planned 
PROTOCOL  PCORI 1507 -[ZIP_CODE]  
  Page 6 
 Version Date: 11/6/17  
 
  procedures, as with a low rectal resection for cancer where a n ostomy  is placed to “protect” a 
new anastomosis w hile it heals. Temporary ostomies  may become permanent  as a result of  
underlying comorbidities, need for other treatments related to cancer, or poor outcome of 
anastomosis (leak or stricture). Peri-operative needs are the same regardless of ostomy  
permanen ce; survivor s should receive clear, systematic, evidence -based ostomy self -
management instruction and support.  
Cancer survivors with ostomies should have a confirmed level of self -management skills, as well 
as a commitment to self -management.  Cognitive res tructuring, problem solving, and self -
efficacy/locus of control are essential tools for effective self -management. As in most chronic 
conditions, this tends to be long -term, complex, and multidimensional. Hit -or-miss ostomy care , 
nurse counseling , and comm unity referral have been the primary modes of self -management 
education and support in the peri -operative period. Clearly, ostomates face many obstacles 
in copi[INVESTIGATOR_891197], not least of which is medical care that often does not meet 
their needs  for effective information, clinical management, psychological support, and 
patient activation .1-[ADDRESS_1247648] to the consequences of their condition, becoming the 
principal caretakers and navigators. Preparation of the survivor and unpaid designated 
caregivers (CGs) (usually family members) is important to assure optimal functioning  and 
HRQOL , as well as  to prevent or ameliorate ostomy -related complications and associ ated 
health care utilization.7 Multiple communication issues make it difficult for ostomy survivors to 
access resources for improving their self -management, and undermine opportunities to improve 
and sustain HRQOL. These resources include lack of consisten t follow -up, travel issues, lack of 
surgeon focus on ostomy -related problems, and lack of ostomy nurse clinic resources.  
Ostomies are associated with multiple HRQOL difficulties.8-12 Ongoing problems include 
pouching care, travel out of the home, social interactions, intimacy, and acceptance 
of/satisfaction with appearance. Studies document persistent challenges including sexuality,11,[ADDRESS_1247649] -operative care, including adaptation, self -
manag ement, and ostomy comfort . 
Usual Care.  Usual care (UC) in peri -operative and long -term settings is not standardized for 
ostomy patients. Usual care does not provide any formal, reproducible training for patients or 
CGs. It typi[INVESTIGATOR_891198] C are Nurse (OCN) who works with patients and CGs 
concerning technical issues (fitting, emptying, supplies, surrounding skin care, etc.) while the 
new ostomate is still an inpatient. Therefore, prior to discharge, most survivors have begun 
learning to care f or their ostomy but will continue learning (primarily on their own) after 
discharge. For some survivors, training may result in [ADDRESS_1247650], leaving less time t o adequately 
train. Additionally, early education is challenging since the bowel or bladder adaptations to 
surgical changes occur over a matter of weeks and months. Survivors are not typi[INVESTIGATOR_891199] a wound care/ostomy clinic. Surv ivors with ostomies may receive 
ostomy care or advice in the context of other scheduled clinic appointments, and then only on 
an “as -needed” basis. Often, there are no recurring support groups or formal peer support 
systems for survivors with ostomies, and  little or no matching of specific products to individual 
patient needs.  
Support Groups.  Some communities or health care systems provide contact [CONTACT_21115] a 
local ostomy support group chapter, but in our research group’s R01 study of Kaiser 
Permanente  (KP) cancer survivors, only 22% of the ostomates reported attending available 
PROTOCOL  PCORI 1507 -[ZIP_CODE]  
  Page 7 
 Version Date: 11/6/[ADDRESS_1247651] 20% of those invited did not join the group, and 
another 20% dropped out before the last session.36 These numbers were approximately the 
same for Goodwin et al. —66% participated, and 19% dropped37—and by [CONTACT_891239]. —20% 
declined to participate and 20% dropped.[ADDRESS_1247652] when multiple sessions were conducted.39 
Each of the four 1 -hour long sessions on “Living With, Through and Beyond Cancer” had more 
than 3,[ADDRESS_1247653] is tremendous and greater 
than with many other cancer treatments. An ostomy is often a prolonged or lifelong disabling 
problem for cancer survivors. The adaptation period is quite variable. In our R01 KP study, 18% 
of participants took  at least one year, or never felt comfortable, in their ostomy care. Importantly, 
many patients cannot attend self -management programs or patient groups for a myriad of 
reasons, including distance to travel, monetary outlays, comorbidities making travel di fficult, or 
lack of access to transportation. In addition, a national shortage of OCNs means patients with 
an ostomy, whether newly placed or a long -term issue, receive little help. It is imperative to 
study interventions for these cancer survivors aimed t o limit family financial burdens, decrease 
medical care use, and improve well -being.  
 
4.1 Inclusion of Women and Minorities

5. There is no maximum time since surgery.  
 
 
6.[ADDRESS_1247654] intervention session.  
 
7.2 Investigator/Site Registration  
 
7.2.1  Study Accrual process  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Patient Identification  Patient identification will be variable by [CONTACT_891240]. For 
patients who are asked to participate, a log will be kept without any identifiable information. This 
log will simply record whether patient accepted or declined. If declined, the reason  for declining 
will ge t recorded.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  University of Pennsylvania  
UP Research Coordinator will use lists of patients from EPIC records in the Colorectal (under 
the direction of [CONTACT_891302]), Urology (under the direction of [CONTACT_891303]),  and 
Ostomy clinics  (under the direction of WOCNs Ave Preston and Matthew Ciabattoni) that have 
undergone an ostomy procedure. In addition, patients who are seen in these clinics will be 
asked if they are willing to be contact[CONTACT_434990]. These  lists include patient names, 
uncoupled from clinical data.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  City of Hope  
Study CRA will work with site -PI ([CONTACT_539623]) to identify appropriate candidates for the study. The 
CRA will work closely with the Departments of Medical Oncology and Department  of Surgery to 
identify eligible participants. She will attend key meetings (ambulatory clinics, tumor boards) on 
a weekly basis and work with attending MDs to identify eligible participants. The attending MD 
will introduce the study to patients and obtain  their permission for the CRA to contact [CONTACT_476]. With 
permission, the CRA will contact [CONTACT_891241], answer 
PROTOCOL  PCORI 1507 -[ZIP_CODE]  
  Page 9 
 Version Date: 11/6/[ADDRESS_1247655] in participation. Study objectives and procedures, and their 
attendant risks and discomforts, will be carefully explained to the participants.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Yale-New Haven  
The Yale Research Assistant will work in collaboration with the site -PI (McCorkle) and site -CoI 
(Ercolano) to identify potential participants for the study. Potential  participants must meet eligibility 
criteria outlined in the study protocol.  Potential areas of recruitment include the outpatient setting 
(ostomy or post -surgical clinics) and inpatient surgical units of the Yale New -Haven Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_891200].  The appropriate medical and nursing staff involved in the 
care of these patients will be contact[CONTACT_33634] a prior i and a method of communication 
and referral will be established between the clinical and research staff.  We will be in c lose touch 
with these referral sources on a daily basis to identify potential patients.  
The clinical staff will approach the patient and ask for his or her permission for the RA to contact 
[CONTACT_476]. Having this permission, the RA will approach the patient to d escribe and explain the study 
purpose, study groups (OSMT training group versus Usual Care Group), randomization 
procedures, study procedures, and human subjects’ protection concerns (right to withdraw, 
confidentiality, risks and benefits, etc.).  
 
7.2.2  Randomization  
Patients who meet eligibility criteria will be approached to enroll in the randomized telehealth 
intervention versus a usual care comparison group using an approved consent process (see 
Schema).  Consents will need to be signed and received prio r to randomization.  
 
Subjects will be randomized using stratified permuted block randomization . Once consented, 
the participant will be randomized to OSMT or UC, using computer -generated random lists 
blocked by [CONTACT_662597], and with assigned arm in sealed envelopes blind to investigators 
and coordinators until assignment. This means that each participating site will have a unique 
pair of computer -generated randomization lists, one for male and the other for female, ensuring 
balance by [CONTACT_891242] a data coordinating center core for each randomization. The randomization 
lists will be comprised of blocks of [ADDRESS_1247656] been randomized.  
 
7.2.3  Consent  
Participant Consent  – Potential p articipants will be afforded sufficient time to consider whether or 
not to participate in th is research  study . If the ostomate  agrees, informed consent will be obtained. 
If patients wish to have more time prior to signing the consent, they may mail back the consent. 
For potential participants contact[CONTACT_159769], the same information will be relayed, and 
they will be asked t o mail the consent prior to randomization. Participants will complete the 
baseline assessment following informed consent.  
 
Caregiver Consent  – Participants will designate their caregivers upon registration. It can be 
anyone they feel they want in that role  for this study. As with participants, caregivers will need to 
have signed a consent prior to participation. Only some basic information will be obtained for 
caregivers, including age, gender, relationship, and current work status. This will be maintained 
in a study sheet for every patient. Appendix [ADDRESS_1247657] digit, 1 =

  University of Pennsylvania, 2 = Yale, and 3 = City of Hop e. Thus, for example, the first subject 
consented at City of Hope would have study ID 3001.  
 
7.2.[ADDRESS_1247658] Reimbursement  
Intervention and Usual Care subjects will receive Greenphire ClinCards  in the amount  of $50 at 
completion of the initial survey, $50 at completion of surveys at the end of the intervention 
sessions, and $50 at completion of the follow -up survey s six months after the end of the 
sessions, for a total of $150. Intervention subject caregivers wi ll receive Greenphire ClinCards  in 
the amount of $25 for each of the two sessions they attend, for a total of up to $50.  
 
8.0 MAILED PACKETS  
Mailed packets will include paper materials , described below. All packets will be mailed from 
and returned to the s ubjects’ respective medical center to ensure that PHI remains at the 
respective medical center. To mitigate the risk of mixing surveys from multiple participants, each 
page of paper surveys MUST have the Study ID pre -entered in its field.  No PHI will appe ar on 
the survey (other than a separate cover letter). After returned paper surveys are processed at 
the medical center, they will be shipped to the UA Data Core.  For RedCap® web-based survey 
administration (described below), the subject survey ID (separa te from the subject ID and 
specific to each survey time) will be provided by [CONTACT_891243].  
Medical Center coordinators will provide their respective subjects survey ID and survey web link 
at the appropriate time, but the survey responses will transmit directly to the RedCap® server at 
the University of Arizona . 
 
8.1 Session Information/Preparation  
Site coordinators at the three accrual sites will communicate to each  other the number of 
subjects being assigned to a group as they are randomized to the Intervention arm. When the 
group enrollment gets to six, they will close enrollment to that group and begin enrolling in the 
next group. Coordinators will slow enrollment if needed so that subjects ar e not enrolled in a 
group starting more than 2 months from the enrollment date.  If needed, the team will discuss 
adding additional groups to the schedule on different dates so that subjects will be able to start 
within the 2 -month window from enrollment da te. 
 
For intervention session schedules, t he protocol will include two different schedules for 
intervention session administration. This design is to provide flexibility for participants and also 
to maximize study accrual and participation. The schedules i nclude:  
 
Schedule #1: Two sessions administered on the same day, with a brea k in between. There will 
be a [ADDRESS_1247659] set of sessions.  
 
Schedule #2: One session administered per day, once a week over a five-week period.  There 
will be a one -week interval between session 2 and session 3 during which the caregiver session 
will be held.  
 
The two schedules vary throughout the study p eriod based on participants’ convenience and 
preference.  
 
If a subject misses a session, they can make up just the mis sed session with the next 1 or 2 
scheduled group s rather than start over with a new group . If they miss both Session 1 and 
Session 2, they can be re -assigned to the next group as long as the next group size doesn’t 
PROTOCOL  PCORI 1507 -[ZIP_CODE]  
  Page 11 
 Version Date: 11/6/17  
 
  exceed 6, or at the ostomy nurses ’ (Nancy Tallman and Christie Simons)  discretion if the group 
size would exceed 6.   
 
If a subject misses Session 3 or Session 4 or both , they can make up the missed session (s) 
with the next [ADDRESS_1247660]’s assigned group will not be required 
to make up the session.  
 
At the start of Session 1, the ostomy nurses will review Appendix 9, Group Rules, and remind 
participants that they can contact [CONTACT_891244].   
 
In any session, if a participant becomes disruptive, it will be noted and if necessary, they will be 
asked to leave the session. The team will discuss the nature of the disruption and how to handle 
the participant for future session s.  
  
8.1.1  Telehealth Connection Information (Appendix 8)  
8.1.2  Group Rules (Appendix 9)  
8.1.3  Goal Setting (Appendix 10)  
Participants will receive the four-page goal setting form (Appendix 10) as part of the patient 
packet mailed to them before the first session, and will be asked to list goals for helpi[INVESTIGATOR_891201] 1  (page 1 of the form). T heir goals will be discussed  during  
Session 1  and will be  revisit ed and possibly revise d in Session 2 (page 2 of the form) and again 
in Session 3 (page 3 of the form). Participants should  be instructed to  keep a copy of the first 
page of the form and return the completed  first page with the baseline surveys . Participants 
should be instructed to return p age 2 after Session 2,  and return page 3  after Session 4 along 
with the interim surveys . The final page 4 should be returned with the followup surveys six 
months after the end of the sessions . Site Coordinators will key in goal setting data for data 
entry.  
 
8.2 Surveys  (Appendices 2 to 7)  
 
8.2.1 Baseline surveys to be completed are:  
1. COH -QOL -CRC (full survey ; Appendix 2a  AND Appendix 2b ) 
2. HADS  (Appendix 3)

8.2.4 RedCap® Surveys.   Surveys will be available to complete electronically via the web in 
RedCap, which will be preferred administration method unless subjects cannot manage the 
method or express a strong preference against it. The UA Data Core will provide each medical 
cente r with a list of survey ID’s linked to subject IDs. The survey ID’s allow the subject to log into 
the RedCap survey and can only be used once. Medical centers will provide each subject with 
the survey link and his or her survey ID at the appropriate time f or each of the three survey 
periods.  
 
8.2.5 Survey Tracking .  Survey/Participant status will be tracked using an MS Access 
tracking database maintained at UA Data Core, with mirror databases at each medical center 
for their respective samples.  However, th e medical center tracking database will account for all 
potentially eligible participants, whereas the UA Data Core tracking database will only contain 
consented subjects.  Since paper surveys are returned to respective sites, whereas RedCap 
surveys are tr ansmitted to UA Data Core, the disposition of consented subjects in the master 
tracking database will be synchronized with the medical center tracking databases on a weekly 
basis .  
 
8.2.[ADDRESS_1247661] with respondents will be initiat ed under four 
circumstances: 1) for non -respondents (paper survey not returned or RedCap survey not 
submitted within 2 weeks of mailing or provision of RedCap survey ID) ; 2) when a returned 
survey has incomplete or illegible data; 3) when the respondent ha s questions or requests a 
call; and 4) if a HADS score is 1 1 or greater  on the depression questions  (Appendix 3) , the 
coordinator will inform the participant that this might indicate depression and they should see 
their physician. This will be documented as a memo in their study file. This will be done within 
24 hours of receiving the survey. This will not preclude their participation.   
 
8.2.7 Returned Survey Processing .  Paper questionnaires returned will be logged in the 
medical center tracking system. This includes packets returned as “undeliverable, no forwarding 
address,” which would generate a phone call to subject to clarify mailing address. RedCap 
questionnaires submitted to UA RedCap server will be logged into the Data Core  tracking 
system. Returned paper questionnaires will be stored securely in a locked office or filing 
cabinet. Each questionnaire will be reviewed for missing responses, improperly marked

Within RedCap on the “My Projects” page (one level up from the PCORI project), there is a tab 
on the right called “Send -it” with an envelope icon. Instructions within the tab are clear to follow. 
Each P DF file should have only one subject and one event (baseline, interim, followup). Files 
should be named according to a consistent naming convention for each site based on subject ID 
number and event (e.g., 1001 baseline.pdf; 2003 followup.pdf, etc.). Data Core staff will 
download PDF files from Send -it to a secure University of Arizona server and key data 
responses into the RedCap database. PDF files will be deleted at end of the study.

1) Recommending  the patient has met at least once with an ostomy nurse (while likely to have 
happened in the peri -operative period, it may not be universal);  
2) Providing the booklet published by [CONTACT_891246], Ostomy, and Continence Nurses’ Society 
entitled “Basic Ostomy Sk in Care: A Guide for Patients and Health Care Providers,” with 
instructions on how to use it;  
3) Local support group contact [CONTACT_3031];  
4) Encouraging patients to have seen their surgeons at least once in follow -up after surgery;  
5) Contact [CONTACT_891247][INVESTIGATOR_11437]; and  
6) Ostomy nurse contact [CONTACT_3031]. If patients have specific questions about materials, the 
research coordinator will clarify the content and encourage the patient to call their physi cian 
or ostomy nurse about a continuing problem. These resources will also be given to those in 
the OSMT program.

serve as assigned “buddies” for each group of the intervention participants (there will be up to 6 
participants for whom each Peer Ostomate is a “buddy”  at one time .) Buddies will be availa ble 
for questions and support during and outside of the training sessions , including exchange of 
phone numbers if requested . Peer Ostomates have been screened and carefully interviewed to 
ensure they are well -acclimated to their ostomies and comfortable di scussing sensitive issues 
with participants. Peers will be invited based on relationships with local ostomy nurses or 
clinicians who feel they would be appropriate for this role. Peer Ostomates who are currently 
under psychiatric care for serious mental il lness or with known psychiatric diagnoses are 
excluded. At the interview, responsibilities will be clearly described.  
Peer Ostomates will only be assigned to those of the same gender. This is to promote 
discussion of sensitive issues where it might be unco mfortable to talk with someone of the 
opposite sex. Peer Ostomates will be trained as both co -facilitators and buddies. This will 
include specific limitations as well as mandates of when to call the research coordinator or site -
PI. Examples may be if parti cipants describe medical symptoms (e.g., fevers, abdominal pain, 
vomiting, bleeding) or psychological problems (e.g., suicidal ideation, extreme depression) that 
need more urgent medical attention. Peer Ostomates will maintain a log to keep track of how 
many times they were called by [CONTACT_891248]. Peers will be trained in 
the curriculum which will differentiate them from study participants.

9.2.4 Program Curriculum.  OSMT sessions are described in Table 5 below. The OSMT is 
organized around several concepts that provide the basis for the content and methods. The 
CCM points to the need for supporting self -efficacy enhancing, evidence based information and 
peer support.  The CG literature points to the need for CGs to be able to step in and provide 
assistance when participants are unable to do for themselves, but not to take over totally and 
create dependency in their family member. The teaching content is divided into fi ve 1.5 - 2 hour 
sessions: three solely for the participants , one for their CG, and one  as a conjoined or single 
visit. Prior to Session 1, participants will list personal goals for participation in OSMT. 
Participants will be given an assignment at the comp letion of Session 2, which will be to monitor 
ostomy output (frequency and consistency of bowel movements and flatus), and problems 
related to pouching system. As urinary diversion patients also have interruption of their intestine 
to make their ostomy, wi th concomitant obstruction/stomal hernia risks, ostomy output issues 
may also be applicable to them. This exercise will assist the ostomate in becoming familiar with 
the relationships between input of food and drink, and ostomy output.

3. Participants  who request it will review and test the system within one week prior of the third 
session to ensure they understand how to get on the calls.  
4. Caregivers will receive reminder calls one day prior to the ir training session.  At this time, the 
coordinator will ask the caregiver’s age, gender, relationship to ostomate, and work status.  
5. Caregivers will review and test the system within one week prior of the ir session to ensure they 
understand how to get on t he calls.  
 
Training Session Description s 
1 Content covers self -management, immediate concerns of ostomates (e.g., definitions, 
associated disease states), daily care, nutritional needs, impact on feelings, skin care 
and clothing changes. Teaching methods are interactive with hands on practice with 
equipment, pouches, and belts. Discussion includes potential ostomy complications. 
Assignment: Monitor ostomy output (frequency and consistency) and problems with 
pouching system.

CG A CG will attend a separate session two weeks  (one week for alternate schedule)  after 
Session 2, akin to Session 2, covering the same topi[INVESTIGATOR_891205] a com fort level with ostomy care. We recognize 
that some participants will not have a CG to participate in this session . Focus for the 
CG will also be within their cultural framework and home environment. Includes 
HRQOL assessment of CG and evaluation of their participation.  
3 Discuss completed assignment. Content promotes a healthy lifestyle via nutritional 
management, physical activity recommendation and overcoming barriers, psychological 
health, and improving attitudes. Participants are encouraged to set ne w priorities, 
evaluate friends, and work on changing negative attitudes. Tips for traveling are 
included. Discussion includes potential ostomy complications. Assignment: Review 
personal goals in regards to ostomy care.

assigned Zoom video conference by [CONTACT_891256]/MAC/Tablet/Smartphone device and clicking Join Meeting.  They will then 
enter the meeting ID number and their first name [CONTACT_891297] “Join”.  In case of technical 
difficulties, they will call ATP technical support for assistance connecting  to the OSMT 
Zoom video conference session.  
9.3.5.  All OSMT video conferencing sessions will use a HIPAA compliant Zoom account 
acquired and managed by [CONTACT_469824], Arizona Telemedicine Program. 
OSMT study participants will receive instruction s in the mail detailing  how to connect to 
the OSMT education session  calls.  
9.3.6.  ATP will receive stud y participant contact [CONTACT_891257]’s status in the 
study, for purposes of providing technical support and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_891207], if required, via verbal communications over telephone directly from study 
participant’s, their caregivers, or study accrual site personnel.  ATP will not receive or 
store study participant information electronically, except temporarily if  participant  
information is lef t as a voicemail message.  ATP wil l record study participant information 
in handwriting on paper.  ATP will shred paper records of study participant information 
once both of the following conditions are met: 1. ATP has been informed by a study 
accrual site  that a participant has completed their OSMT sessions or has withdrawn from 
participation in the study; and 2. Equipment loaned by [CONTACT_587876], if any, 
has been returned to ATP per the participant loan agreement terms.  
 
9.4 Sessions  
Site coordinators will provide the ostomy nurse educator with the name [CONTACT_891298] (use first names only). Attendance list s will be reviewed  at the weekly 
research meetings.  Introductions and a ttend ance will be taken at each session and recorded by 
[CONTACT_891258].  They will also ask what type of device people are using. At the end 
of the session they will ask to rate [ADDRESS_1247672] to their ostomy care (e.g., equipment 
problems, difficulty obtaining supplies , etc.) either during the sessions or in communications with 
the site coordinators, will be referred to the local site ostomy nu rse(s).  
 
If all participants in a session are of the same gender, they will be asked if they are comfortable 
with the Peer Ostomate of the other gender staying on the session.

11.0 CRITERIA FOR EVALUAT ION AND ENDPOINT DEFINITIONS  
 
 
Study instruments and endpoints  Endpoints  
Patient Activation Measure (PAM).  The 
PAM uses a uni -dimensional, probabilistic 
Guttman -like scale that reflects a 
developmental model of activation that 
involves four stages: (1) believing the patient 
role is important, (2) having the confidence 
and knowledge necessary to take action, (3 ) 
actually taking action to maintain and improve 
one’s health, and (4) staying the course even 
under stress. High internal consistency (alpha 
.87) and construct validity have been reported.  PAM (continuous [ADDRESS_1247673] activated)  
 
Level 1: May not yet believe that the 
patient role is important (PAM ≤ 47.0)  
Level 2: Lacks confidence and knowledge 
to take action (PAM 47.1 to 55.1)  
Level 3: Beginning to take action (PAM 
55.2 to 67.0)  
Level 4: Has difficulty maintaining 
behaviors over time (PAM ≥ 67.1)

12.2 Aim 1:  Using our enhanced telehealth techniques, determine if patient activation , self -
efficacy, ostomy -related knowledge, and HRQOL will be improved and sustained over time in 
the online  interactive communication Ostomy Self -Management Telehealth program (OSMT) 
curriculum compared to a UC group.  
Under an intent -to-treat approach,  change in outcomes will be evaluated longitudinally with 
linear mixed models, testing the effect of study arm adjusted for potential confounders. Such 
models evaluate both associations and rates of change, accounting for within -subject 
correlation. The Primary Outcome will be PAM. Secondary Outcomes include SE, COH -QOL -
CRC scales, and Ostomy Knowledge.  Post hoc c ontrasts will evaluate effect of training 
(baseline to post) and whether effect is sustained after training ([ADDRESS_1247677] to follow -up). 
Standard multivariable modeling procedures will be used to select or eliminate potential 
confounding variables, startin g with candidate variables that are biologically plausible or found 
to be associated with endpoint change scores (baseline vs. follow -up) in bivariate analyses with 
a p-value of less than 0.20. Potential candidate covariates and confounders include (but ar e not 
limited to) CG participation in training sessions, depression (HADS), time since surgery, ostomy 
type, age, sex, stage, anticipated permanence of ostomy, and pre - or post -surgical radiation or 
chemotherapy. We will explore potential interaction for p lausible effect modifiers, such as 
gender, or having a CG .   
The COH QOL -CRC assesses ostomy burden and care abilities, including time taken to perform 
daily ostomy care, comfort with ostomy care, comfort with diet, adjustment of diet for ostomy, 
appetite,  clothing and other problems with ostomy placement. We will also measure clinically 
related outcomes, including  medical attention for problems with bowel, bladder, or ostomy. 
Changes in these responses will be compared between treatment groups with linear mixed 
models, chi -square tests or t -tests, as appropriate.  
Descriptive statistics will be presented on attendance at training sessions. We will describe and 
contrast quantity and type of ostomy -care help (professional and lay) sought outside of the 
trainin g sessions, including calls for support from study Peer Ostomates. Self -reported Peer 
Ostomate call frequency and duration will be corroborated with a call log maintained by [CONTACT_891261]. We will evaluate hypothesized association between OSMT attendan ce level and 
outcomes using linear mixed models that have a weighted attendance score as an independent 
variable . Alternative attendance scores will be tested that give weight to ostomy -care help 
outside of training sessions.  
12.3 Aim 2:  Determine the differences in ostomy -related medical care utilization  and family 
financial burden  imposed on survivors between OSMT and UC groups.  
Hypothesis 2.1:  OSMT telehealth subjects will use fewer ostomy -specific  family resources 
in the 6 months after OSMT compared to UC subjects.  
Hypothesis 2.2:  OSMT telehealth subjects will use fewer ostomy -specific  health care 
services in the 6 months after OSMT compared to UC subjects.  
Question 2.1:   What is the difference in the overall levels of ostomy -related  family financial 
burden between OSMT and UC groups?  
Question 2.2:   What are types and levels of effort of OSMT intervention personnel and 
specific equipment, supplies, and informatics support required to implement and o perate a 
successful OSMT program; what are participants’ levels of use of ostomy -specific health care

  services and supplies; and what are the time and in -home requirements for participating in 
OSMT for survivors and their family caregivers. This informatio n is required for replicating our 
OSMT intervention in the event that we find it improves the primary and secondary outcomes 
of OSMT participants.  
The focus of Aim [ADDRESS_1247678] ivities for individuals participating in OSMT with those receiving UC. Assessment of 
these measures is critical for patient -centered care, in order to minimize the financial burdens 
and non -financial impacts (e.g., time commitment) of new interventions. To  address hypotheses 
2.[ADDRESS_1247679] detailed information on use of medical care services and supplies 
related to ostomy care, patient burden for these services and supplies, required patient and 
caregiver time for ostomy care, interference wit h employment and volunteer activities, and 
perceived financial burden. Details regarding the four types of information to be collected for 
Aim 2 are presented below. We also provide information on assessment on study activities to 
address replication of th e OSMT intervention (Question 2.2).  
12.[ADDRESS_1247680] information 
from study participants on their use of supplies and services related to ostomy care and their 
out-of-pocket expenses for these supplies /services. Ostomy -related services/supplies will be 
categorized in two separate groups:  
 Medical care encounters and ostomy supplies including: OCN visits; other ostomy -related 
medical care encounters (including physician and ED visits); surgical revision o f stoma; 
ostomy appliances, wafers, bags; bowel medications; and skin medications.  
 Other equipment, household modifications related to ostomy and ostomy care, including: 
waterproof covers on for mattresses and furniture; bathroom remodels to accommodate 
ostomy care; special clothing to cover ostomy bag; alteration of clothing to cover ostomy 
bag, and transportation to and parking for ostomy -related medical care.    
12.[ADDRESS_1247681] ostomy -related time 
requirements , that is, patient time required to obtain ostomy care , perform ostomy bag and 
wafer management, and clean ostomy bag spi[INVESTIGATOR_3353]. We will also ask study participants about use 
of both formal and informal CGs, time for caregiving activities related to ostomy ca re, and types 
of assistance (e.g., with housekeepi[INVESTIGATOR_891209]) required due to ostomy and ostomy care.  
12.6 Employment/Volunteering Effects.  All participants will be asked about their current 
employment status and volunteer activities (including usual hours per week devoted to work and 
volunteering). All subjects will be asked if their ostomy -related management and health 
problems led to work -loss days, sick leave days, leave without pay, changes in amount of hours 
worked and/or volunteered, loss of emp loyment or volunteer opportunity, job -related corrective 
actions, and impaired job search and/or volunteer activities.  
12.[ADDRESS_1247682] patient burden for ostomy services an d supplies as well as patient and caregiver time 
and interference with employment. Patients will be requested to provide information on 
perceived financial burden associated with ostomy -related care and on deferral of doctor visits 
and medication pi[INVESTIGATOR_9696] -up/refills because of financial pressures.  
Information for Aim 2 will be collected using a self -administered patient questionnaire. 
(Appendix D)  
12.8 OSMT Intervention Replication Model .  Disseminating/replicating our OSMT 
intervention program requires: 1) an intervention operations manual; 2) official versions of all 
PROTOCOL  PCORI 1507 -[ZIP_CODE]  
  Page 24 
 Version Date: 11/6/17  
 
  intervention materials for interventionists and participants; and, 3) a fully -annotated 
staffing/budget model. One cannot ex pect to realize the same outcomes observed from our 
research implementation of OSMT if subsequent replications are under -budgeted and/or 
“trimmed” relative to our research and demonstration implementation. Another replication 
challenge is that the original  research proposal may not be an appropriate replication guide 
because proposal budgets are typi[INVESTIGATOR_891210], and research teams revise 
their interventions in accordance with their lower budgets and implementation obstacles 
encountered . Consequently, research implementations often differ substantially from the 
intervention program initially proposed and peer -reviewed. The observed outcomes of an 
intervention reported in the major outcomes publications were achieved by [CONTACT_891262], not by [CONTACT_891263]. We will implement a project resource tracking system and start it as quickly 
as possible after notice of grant award (so we can document intervent ion fixed resources and 
start-up activities and resources, such as interventionist training) and planning efforts prior to 
the intervention launch. This will allow us to provide actual rather than projected costs 
associated with the OSMT intervention.  
Our OSMT program replication model will include the incremental physical resources required to 
implement the OSMT program, excluding research -specific inputs. We will follow the 
methodology outlined in Ritzwoller and colleagues42 to collect intervention -relate d inputs in real 
time (vs. retrospectively). Interventionist and research staff will complete templates weekly to 
capture the following data: 1) time spent hiring and training interventionists and Peer Ostomate 
mentors; 2) time incurred preparing training syllabi, Webinar presentations and handouts, 
participant homework exercises, Webinar attendance records, e -mail and telephone call logs, 
participant chart folders, etc.; 3) marketing and advertising activities for participant recruitment; 
4) Webinar prepar ation and set -up time, direct Webinar contact [CONTACT_5586], post -Webinar wrap -up and 
charting; 5) Peer Ostomate mentoring time; 6) e -mail and telephone contact [CONTACT_891264]/peer mentors during and between intervention sessions 
(number of contacts, duration of each contact, and time required to chart each contact); 7) 
intervention IT and web conferencing equipment; 8) staff time spent helpi[INVESTIGATOR_891211], if needed; 9) study -provided web appliances; 
and, 10) for participants/mentors who are informal caregivers, substitute caregivers to enable 
participation in OSMT webinars, if necessary. We will collect data on patient -related inputs via 
survey.  
In assessing the resources used by [CONTACT_891265], we will pull out research inputs (i.e., 
resources used only because this is a comparative study rather than a “real -world” clinical 
program).42,[ADDRESS_1247683] research measures 
(excludi ng intervention fidelity measures), IRB/HIPAA compliance, and consenting participants. 
For those items that can be attributed to research and the intervention (OSMT management by 
[CONTACT_976], project manager time, joint research/intervention project meetings, etc.) , we will estimate on 
a monthly basis the percentage of project intervention labor effort attributable to research and 
subtract from total project effort.  
12.[ADDRESS_1247684] -related 
activities, with an emphasis on identifying research -specific tasks, intervention -specific tasks, 
and joint research/intervention tasks. For example , data analysts working on research data and 
PROTOCOL  PCORI 1507 -[ZIP_CODE]  
  Page 25 
 Version Date: 11/6/17  
 
  statistical analysis tasks represent a research input. Programmers working on an intervention 
tracking/scheduling system represent an intervention resource. The most intensive class of 
labor —investigators —have r esponsibility for both intervention implementation and fidelity, as 
well as for designing data collection instruments and performing statistical analyses. Hence, we 
will require each investigator to apportion their project -specific effort across classes of  research 
and implementation tasks. We will review and revise the time -task data collection instruments 
so that all staff understands the definitions of the respective tasks and have places to report all 
their relevant direct effort activities.  
12.10  Non-Labor.  We will also track all classes of non -labor intervention inputs, including 
study -furnished web appliances, intervention office supplies, reference materials for 
interventionists, auto mileage, office space rental, communications (telephone/internet/ Web), 
mailings (for sending intervention materials to interventionists and participants), etc. For 
purposes of clinical replication, specificity in tracking quantities of specific inputs  is an 
essential need. Note:  We are not proposing to collect or analyz e incurred expenses for this 
study as these will vary substantially over time and place . 
12.[ADDRESS_1247685] an open -ended question at the end of the questionnaire in 
Appendix D – Survivor/Family Use of Ostomy Care: “ … Please share with us the greatest 
challenge you have encountered in having an ostomy.”   As indicated in the proposal, qualitative 
content will be placed into an Excel file. Using a qualitative, grounded theory approach44 and 
content analysis45, all surve y responses will be reviewed by [CONTACT_891266] a list of unique topi[INVESTIGATOR_891212]. Codes for these topi[INVESTIGATOR_891213]. The resulting code book with categories  and 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_891214]. The codebook will then be shared among the entire Research Team, discussed, and 
any data discordantly coded will be discussed for refinement and con sensus. The resulting 
content will be used to provide data for manuscripts in the same way it was used in the 
Research Team’s past publications with similar text data.46-50 
12.13  Sample Size and Power. Total potential sample size 240 (up to 120 per arm), to ensure  
at least 75 per arm completing the study  with complete baseline COH -QOL -CRC scaled items , 
assuming a 15% dropout rate. This will maintain sufficient power for the COH -QOL -CRC scaled 
items. The larger sample size for the primary endpoint s Patient Activation Measure (PAM) and 
ostomy management self -efficacy (SE) will provide 80% power to detect a 2.75 change in PAM 
and a 0.50 change in SE, which is not considered excessively powered . Detectable differences 
based on variances observed from our R21 fo r PAM and SE, as well as from our R01 for COH -
QOL -CRC subscales. We changed two items slightly on the self -efficacy questions to make 
them ostomy -relevant. Our observed variation for ostomy management SE is consistent with the 
original form of symptom mana gement SE across different patient samples reported by [CONTACT_891267]’s 
group (SD range 2.1 to 2.4).51-[ADDRESS_1247686] a Cronbach’s alpha of > 0.75. Calculated detectable differences were based on the

13.0 STAKEHOLDER OVERSIGH T 
 
13.1 STAKEHOLDER ROLES  
13.1.1  Ostomy Nurses:   Ostomy Nurses (WOCNs) will have dual roles in this study: 1) Session 
leaders, and 2) Research Team participants. Ostomy nurses have actively participated in analysis 
of the results of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] (Ref 6), as well as the design of the current proposal . In particular, 
WOCNs have assisted with:  1) identification of cancer survivor and caregiver needs related to 
ostomy care; 2) addressing nursing deficiencies for ostomates; 3) the curriculum design and plan 
of delivery; and 4) features of the comparator arm. They will co -lead the sessions and ensure 
participant and research goals are met. They will participate in weekly calls to report on sessions, 
help troubleshoot as needed, and ultimately prepare and present findings. The non -Tucson 
Ostomy Nurses will also be asked to participate in sessions and calls. They may impart 
suggestions as needed during the calls, and may be asked to lead in future calls. For Usual Care 
participants, if they have never interacted with an Ostomy Nurse, they will be offered at m inimum 
a telephone consultation.   
 
13.1.2  Peer (buddy) Ostomates :  Peer Ostomates are patients who live with ostomies and are 
well-versed with the curriculum and study objectives. They will have dual roles in the study:  1) 
Session co -leaders, and 2) Research Team participants. Peers who participated in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_891215], although peers at other sites, who have been screened and agree 
to participate, will also be trained in the program and develop rapport with the ostomy nur ses who 
will co -lead sessions. They will also be expected to participate in weekly research calls and impart 
their thoughts on the sessions and issues that need to be addressed. They will participate in 
presentation of findings, including at local ostomy g roup meetings and with major publications.    
 
Peers will be trained over the phone by [CONTACT_978]. The curriculum and the protocol will be reviewed, 
as well as their roles, and to recommend the participant see their physician for any clinically 
related issues.

 Version Date: 11/6/[ADDRESS_1247688] in a multi -site study. Finally, while  the 
Research Team is experienced, ostomy nurses and peers will be on the Research Team, and we 
anticipate members of the SAC will play a role in data interpretation.  
 
13.2.2  SAC Qualifications:   The SAC will be composed of ostomy nurses, peer ostomates, 
patients, and caregivers who have participated in our program to date in Tucson or those 
recommended by [CONTACT_891268]. In addition, we will add additional members 
(peer ostomates and patients) who have completed the telehealth intervent ion and are interested 
in continuing to participate with the research as needed. We will have a maximum of six non -
Research Team members of the SAC, with an equitable distribution of patients and caregivers. 
The group will determine its chairperson, who wi ll be expected to report to the Research Team. 
Members of the SAC (except the Research Team participants) will be compensated for their time 
with $100 per meeting.  
 
13.2.3  Recruitment to the SAC:  Development of our recruitment plan for the SAC will occur 
during the first meeting of the Research Team at the initiation of the study. Potential SAC 
members will be reviewed by [CONTACT_891269]. They will be 
invited by a Stakeholder member of the Research Team.  
 
13.2.4  Meetin gs of the SAC:   A telephone conference line will be established for the quarterly 
meetings of the SAC. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_891216]. One leader will be designa ted. High priority items for 
the agenda will be related to recruitment activities. The SAC minutes will be circulated to the 
Research Team, and the SAC leader will present them at the next Research Team meeting. 
Subsequent agendas for the quarterly meeting s will include a discussion of recruitment to date, 
and any problems/challenges in study implementation. Feedback to the Research Team will occur 
via minutes from the SAC. The Research Team will provide a report of the study to date at each 
meeting. Activi ties of the SAC will be included in the annual project reports.

A. Teaching Points  
1. What is an Ostomy?  
a. An ostomy is a surgical opening onto the abdomen. There are three 
common types of ostomies which will be discussed.

bladder has been removed.  A small pi[INVESTIGATOR_891220] (ileum) is 
surgically removed and used as a conduit.  Occasionally large bowel is 
used. The two ureters from the kidneys are attached to this pi[INVESTIGATOR_891221] t.  The one end of bowel is sutured closed and the 
other end of the conduit is brought out through the abdominal wall creating 
the stoma.

Please download and install the Zoom client before attempting to join the meeting.   For PC/MAC download the Zoom 
Client for Meeting s from https://zoom.us/download#client_4meeting   .   For iOS (iPhone/iPad/iPod) 
https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id546505307  and for Android devices:

You do not need to create a Zoom account to join a Zoom meeting.   Only the m eeting host that sends the invitation 
needs to have a Zoom account.   You can create a Zoom account if you wish, but it is not required.  
 
To test your ability to connect to Zoom at any time visit http://zoom.us/test    
 
For technical assistance connecting to Zoom, please contact [CONTACT_891282] (ATP) Help Desk at 520 -626-
6978 or [EMAIL_16968]   
 
Video conferencing participant s should review the following information and instructions:  
 
 Join the video call on MM/DD and MM/DD from a quiet location with minimal background/ambient noise with 
good lighting (avoid backlighting such as with your back to a brightly lit window).  Keep in  mind that others on 
the video call will be able to see everything that is in your camera’s field of view. Ideally, position your camera to 
minimize any potential visual distractions, and as close to eye level as possible.  
 Join the video call at 15 -30 minu tes prior to the start of the video conference session to allow time for 
troubleshooting in case of connection difficulty.    
 Position yourself relative to your device’s camera so the camera is capturing a relatively close -up image of your 
face. Examples:  
 
     
  
 Please fill in your first name [CONTACT_891301].   This can also be done while you are on the video call by 
[CONTACT_891283].   Your entry in the participant list will have (me) next to it.  
 Look into the c amera when you are speaking to give others on the call the best view of you while you are 
communicating to them.  
 Please practice good video conference etiquette. Mute your microphone and/or camera if you need to do 
something that would be an audible or vis ible distraction to others. Video conferencing is similar to being in the 
same physical room meeting with people, except that sounds, such as rustling paper or bags for example, are 
much more distracting than they would be if you were meeting in person.

 Version Date: 11/6/17  
 
 
 
 
  Keep your microphone muted by [CONTACT_18943] / tappi[INVESTIGATOR_891232].   For PC/Mac move the mouse pointer within the Zoom video window and look for the controls that 
appear along the bottom of the window.   For tablet or smartphone, touch the screen to display the Zoom 
controls and then touch the mic icon to mute.   Repeat these actions to unmute the microphone.   Please unmute 
before speaking so that others can hear you, but mute the mic as soon as possible follo wing your comments.  
 
                           
 
 Only [ADDRESS_1247738] to the same Zoom meeting ID.   Having 
more than one device on the same call in the same physical room will inevitably lead to high pi[INVESTIGATOR_891233].  
 If you lose connection or you see no change in the video image on your screen for an extended tim e period, you 
can leave the call by [CONTACT_18943] “Leave Meeting” in the Zoom video window and reconnect by [CONTACT_891284].    
 On PC/Mac, clicking on the ^ symbol along the lower left next to the microphone or camera wi ll show a list of 
available microphones and cameras connected to your system.   Generally you won’t need to do anything here, 
but if others can’t hear you when your mic is not muted, or if you can’t hear even though you have your volume 
turned up, or others  can’t see you when your video should be on, you can check here to make sure that the 
correct microphone, speakers and camera are selected for your computer.  
 On smartphones and tablets, you will want to use the front facing camera, which should be selected  by [CONTACT_891285].   If the rear camera is being used by [CONTACT_891286], touch the screen and tap the 
camera icon to switch to the front camera.  
 For PC/Mac/Smartphone/Tablet, you may also use a headset if you prefer instead of your device ’s speakers 
and/or microphone.  
 You need a reliable high -speed Internet connection to video conference .  Your connection should be able to 
support 1.5 megabits per second (Mbps) sustained download and upload speeds for best 
performance.   Connectivity at low er speeds is possible down to about 600 kilobits per second (.6Mbps).  At 
lower speeds motion of video images may become jerky or frozen temporarily.   WiFi or Wired Internet 
connectivity is best.   
 It is possible to connect to Zoom via a cellular data conne ction through carriers such as Verizon, ATT and 
others.   VIDEO CONFERENCING USES A LOT OF DATA.   This can quickly exhaust a limited data plan from a 
wireless carrier.   1.[ADDRESS_1247739], check your device’s signal strength indicator.   More 
bars generally means faster and  more reliable connectivity. Aim for full or near full signal strength when video 
conferencing with your device.   Sometimes moving closer to a window, changing device orientation, or moving 
to another room closer to the exterior of a building can significa ntly impact signal strength.   You can get an 
estimate of your Internet download and upload speeds by [CONTACT_891287].net or using the Speedtest.net app 
and running the speedtest.

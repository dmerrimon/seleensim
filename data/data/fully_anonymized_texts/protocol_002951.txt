Protocol Version 11/09 /2017 Page 2 of 13 Polysomnographic Study Comparing the Use of Dexmedetomidine and Zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_562417]:  Oluwaseun Johnson -Akeju, M.D.  
BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE           
Sleep is a natural human behavioral state of decreased arousal, crucial for survival, 
maintenance of health and consolidation of newly learned information.1,2,3,4 Population -based 
studies  estimate that 25 to 35% of American adults suffer from transient insomnia, 10% to 15% 
from chronic insomnia, with 2 to 6% of the population taking medications to promote sleep.5,[ADDRESS_739141] generally involved beha vioral changes and pharmacotherapy with 
sedating antidepressants, antihistamines, anti -cholinergics, melatonin receptor agonists, 
benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], and non -benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_82490].10,11 The benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_562418] ( Ambien CR), zaleplon (Sonata), zopi[INVESTIGATOR_11123] (Imovane), and 
eszopi[INVESTIGATOR_11123] (Lunesta) form the mainstay of current treatment.10,11 These drugs modulate the 
activity of the γ -Amino butyric acid A receptor causing a generalized state of sedation with 
alteration of normal sleep electrophysiology. Additionally, they pose the added risk of tolerance 
and dependence.10,11  
 
The architecture of natural sleep cons ists of regular cycling at approximately 90 -minute intervals 
between non rapid eye movement (nREM) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Since these 
drugs do not provide for natural non REM -REM cycling, they lead to disruption in awake -
performance and create  what many patients report as a state of grogginess.11 Consequently, 
these medications do not provide the restorative benefits of natural sleep. Furthermore, 
consistency in sleep maintenance by [CONTACT_562436].10 Hence, 
the be neficial effects from effective sleep therapi[INVESTIGATOR_562419].  
 
With this in mind, we are proposing to uncover the benefits of the medication, 
dexmedetomidine, for inducing physiologically natural sl eep in insomniacs. The FDA approved 
dexmedetomidine in 1999 for short -term sedation by [CONTACT_562437].12 Its indication was recently expanded to include non -intubated patients requiring 
sedation for surgery or procedu res.12 The neurophysiological and behavioral characteristics of 
the sedative state induced by [CONTACT_562438].13, 14, 15 This 
is because dexmedetomidine binds to alpha 2 receptors on neurons in the locus ceruleus (LC),  
causi ng an inhibition of the LC with the downstream effect of VLPO activation via direct 
neuronal projections. The active VLPO facilitates GABA A and galanin mediated inhibition of the 
midbrain, hypothalamic, and pontine arousal nuclei, promoting non REM sleep. 16,17,18,[ADDRESS_739142].  Since this drug 
is an intravenous agent, it has not been immediately appare nt that it might be useful as a 
therapeutic agent for sleep therapy.  
 
We propose to undert ake a study to characterize the benefits of dexmedetomidine for inducing 
a natural, restful night's sleep in insomniacs. Intravenous dexmedetomidine will be administered 
to promote sleep in healthy volunteers and patients with insomnia, comparing its effec ts to the 
 
Protocol Version 11/09 /[ADDRESS_739143] is based upon the 
mechanistic understanding of how dexmedetomidine works,  clinical experience with the 
sedative state induced by [CONTACT_258283], electroencephalogram ( EEG) patterns that are 
consistent with natural sleep in recent medical literature and on the SEDLine™ Brain -Function 
Monitoring System  utilized in the MGH operating rooms.  
 
In contrast to existing sleep medications, which are non -specific sedatives, we bel ieve that 
dexmedetomidine is biochemically well suited to engage the natural mechanisms that drive 
sleep. This study would help demonstrate that dexmedetomidine can be used to induce normal 
physiological sleep in humans suffering from insomnia, providing a  new approach to the 
treatment of this debilitating disorder by [CONTACT_562439] a new class of medications to be 
developed as a sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_160953].  In addition to this, a novel neurophysiological description of the 
state of the brain under this new and impo rtant drug will be accomplished.  
 
SPECIFIC AIMS: 
The specific aims of this research project will test our hypotheses that dexmedetomidine 
exhibits neurophysiological and behavioral characteristics that closely resemble normal sleep in 
humans.  
Hypothesis 1: Intravenous therapy with dexmedetomidine will induce a sedative state whose 
architecture closely resembles the architecture of natural sleep                                                                        
Hypothesis 2:  The architecture of the seda tive state induced by [CONTACT_562440][INVESTIGATOR_562420] 3:  Dexmedetomidine will have minimal to no effect on the sleep archite cture of 
healthy subjects  
Hypothesis 4:  Dexmedetomi dine will be objectively and subjectively more restful than 
zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_6730] .  
Hypothesis 5:  Compared to zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_6730], next day cognitive and psychomotor function will be 
improved  
 
SUBJECT SELECTION  AND ENROLLMENT  
We will select 30 male and female volunteers for this study, comprised of 15 healthy controls 
and 15 patients with insomnia between the ages of 18 and 35.  
 
The subjects will be recruited using:

2. MGH Research Study Volunteer Program.  
3. Through the Division of Sleep Medicine at [LOCATION_005] General Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_562421]. Patients found suitable will be given information abou t the 
study. This will include a clear statement that decision to forego or participate  in the study will 
have no impact on their ongoing medical treatment.  
All subjects will be fit and healthy, meeting the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) 
physi cal status classification P1 (normal healthy patient) or P2 (stable chronic problem)  and of 
normal body habitus . A complete medical history will be taken in addition to performing a 
complete physical examination in order to rule out active and chronic medi cal problems.

Abnormal findings on physical examination will provide reason for exclusion from the study. 
Abnormal finding(s) will be reported to the affected subject and recommendation(s) for medical 
follow -up will be given as needed.  
 
Screen ing Tests . A complete blood count, blood glucose level, liver function test (LFT), blood 
urea nitrogen (BUN), and creatinine (Cr) level will be obtained at the initial screening visit. For 
inclusion into the study protocol, each subject will be required to  have a platelet count, blood 
glucose, BUN and Cr levels in the normal range. LFT's for inclusion will be required to be within 
1.5 times the upper limit of normal. Additionally, white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and 
differential will be required to rang e within 15% normal values in order to be included in the 
study.  Each subject will provide a urine specimen for a toxic substance screen both at the initial 
 
Protocol Version 11/09 /[ADDRESS_739144]  at the initial examination and each active study day. Positive toxicity screening 
and/or positive results on the pregnancy test will prompt exclusion from the study. A 5-lead 
electrocardiogram will be performed on all study subjects at the initial screeni ng visit to identify 
any pre -existing cardiac issues.  On active study nights, a five lead electrocardiogram will be 
applied to continuously monitor cardiac electrophysiological status.  
 
If a subject in the insomnia group is already taking prescription medi cations for sleep, he/she 
will not be eligible for the study. We will only be recruiting insomnia subjects who are 
undergoing behavioral therapy or are not being pharmacologically treated for insomnia.

Protocol Version 11/09 /2017 Page 7 of 13 Active study nights will not occur back -to-back ensuring that there are no residual effects or 
interactions with the drugs being studied (i.e., a 48 hour  washout period ,). Visit [ADDRESS_739148] will  be aware of the treatment assignment.  
 
Since the order in which these treatments are given is randomized at study enrollment, the 
active pil l day (zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_215165]) will never coincide with the active intravenous day 
(dexmedetomidine administration). Each subject will only receive dexmedetomidine  or zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_562423] .  
 
Initial Screening Visit: 
Prior to the beginning of the study, the study  subject will sign informed consent. Next, the 
subject will undergo an initial pre -anesthetic exam and toxicology screening to assess 
exclusionary criteria. A pregnancy test will be administered to female subjects. A 
electrocardiogram will be performed on all study subjects at the initial screening visit to identify 
any pre -existing cardiac issues. Subject will also complete a questionnaire concerning his/her 
sleep habits. This questionnaire is in clinical use by [CONTACT_164245][INVESTIGATOR_258274]. Afterward, the subject  may be outfitted with an Actiwatch actigraphy monitor, similar 
to a regular wrist watch, to track their activity levels prior to the first study day. Every subject will 
be required to maintain a sleep log from the week prior  to the first study night, until the last study 
night.  
 
Study Visit 1:  Subject will arrive at the study site . Actigraphy and the sleep log will be checked 
to ensure that the subject has kept a consistent schedule, in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_562424]. A toxicology screen will be administered to exclude the use of pr ohibited 
substances, and female  subject will again be required to undergo a pregnancy test.   
 
High-density EEG will be collected using  a flexible cap with embedded electrodes that  fits over 
the subject's head and fastens beneath the chin.  Physiological measures may also include  2 
electrooculogram (EOG) channels, 2 chin electromyogram (EMG) channels, a 5 lead 
electrocardiogram (ECG), saturated oxygen levels, heart rate, non -invasive  blood pressure cuff , 
end-tidal CO 2, and audio/video data. All of the leads and sensors used are removed easily and 
comfortably following the sleep study.  
 
The EEG cap will be placed on the subject to enable acclimation to the device. ECG, EOG and 
EMG cha nnels will be attached, and a mock (non -invasive) intravenous line will be attached so 
that the subject can acclimate to the sensation of contact [CONTACT_258287]. The purpose of the 
first study night is for the subject to become acclimated to the study sit e and recording 
equipment, as well as to obtain a baseline reading of their brain activity during sleep.  
 
Just before bed the subject will participate in a [ADDRESS_739149] (PVT), as 
well as the Motor Sequence Task (MST) and then  be ins tructed to try to sleep for 8 -hours. If 
he/she wakes up before the designated time, he/she will be instructed to stay in bed and try to 
go back to sleep. After the sleep period,  has concluded  the subject will then again participate in 
a [ADDRESS_739150] (PVT)  and the Motor Sequence Task (MST) .  Upon 
conclusion of testing a  member of the study staff will rem ove the physiological monitors and the 
subject will be permitt ed to shower and eat breakfast and will then be permitted to resume 
his/her day as normally would.  
 
 
Protocol Version 11/09 /[ADDRESS_739151]'s room with audio 
and video equipment. An on -call physician is available, at all times, in the event of an 
unforeseen problem.  
 
Study Visit 2:  Subject will return to the study site . A toxicology screen will be administered to 
exclude the use of prohibited substances. Electrodes on the EEG cap will be fixed in place with 
conductive paste, and ECG, EOG and EMG channels will be attached per standard pr ocedure. 
The subject will then participate in a [ADDRESS_739152] (PVT)  and complete  
the Motor Sequence Task (MST).  If indicated according to the randomization schedule, a  
peripheral intravenous line will  be placed  for administration of dexmedetomidine.  We will then 
follow the “DEXMEDETOMIDINE DOSING PROCEDURES” listed below . 
 
The subject will be instructed to try to sleep for 8 -hours. If he/she wakes up before the 
designated time, he/she will be instructed to stay in bed and try to go ba ck to sleep. After [ADDRESS_739153] (PVT) and  the Motor Sequence Task (MST).  Upon the conclusion of testing a  member of 
the study staff will remove the physiological moni tors, and the subject will be permitted to 
shower. Prior to leaving the study site , each subject will complete a brief post -sleep 
questionnaire. This will also include some questions about dreams. In addition, the subject will 
respond to a questionnaire re garding time estimation – not only of his/her sleep patterns from 
the prior night, but also of the time required to perform the various cognitive and other testing 
components described above.  The will help address the issue of sleep misperception which is  
common in the insomnia population (likely multi -factorial, and one of the potential contributors is 
misperception of elapsed time).  
 
Each subject may be fitted with an Actiwatch actigraphy monitor prior to leaving the study site  to 
monitor his/her sleep cycle until the following study visit. Subject s will then resume his/her 
normal workday.  
 
Study Visit 3:  The subject will repeat the protocol as specified in Study Visit 2. However, it will 
be the second of the randomized treatments; he/she will receive z olpi[INVESTIGATOR_6730] , dexmedetomidine  or 
regular sleep .  
 
Study Visit 4:  The subject will repeat the protocol as specified in Study Visit [ADDRESS_739154] of the randomized treatments; he/she will receive zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_6730], dexmedetomidine or 
regular sleep . 
 
Study Visit 5 (optional):  The subject will repeat the protocol as specified in Study Visit 2. 
However, this study  visit will not be randomized ; he/she will receive dexmedetomidine during an 
active study day instead of night. This will enable us to study the e ffect of the human circadian 
rhythm on sleep induction with dexmedetomidine.  
 
Dexmedetomidine Dosing Procedures  
Dexmedetomidine will be administered by [CONTACT_562443] a 
peripheral [ADDRESS_739155] will initiate and terminate 
the dexmedetomidine infusion using the following dosing scheme:  Subjects will be randomized 
by [CONTACT_562444] 1.0mcg/kg over 10 minutes  or 0.5  mcg/kg over 
10 minutes . 1.0 mcg/kg  is the sta ndard specification for the loading dose for procedural 
sedation.[ADDRESS_739156] of care is maintain ed at an 
 
Protocol Version 11/09 /[ADDRESS_739157]’s safety and comfort needs a re met.  
 
On the active dexmedetomidine study night, discharge home will be based on criteria 
established by [CONTACT_562445][INVESTIGATOR_562425]. The  subject must have stable vital  signs, i.e., within 20% of pre -
study values, be able to respond appropriately to normal commands, be pain free, be free from 
any nausea and vomiting, and have no bleeding from the intravenous insertion site. Subjects 
will be advised not to drive or operate heavy equipment for [ADDRESS_739158] will undergo  the Motor Sequence Task (MST)  and the PVT before and after sleep of 
each visit.  
 
Motor Sequence Task:  Participants will be trained on a motor sequence task (MST), a well -
established probe  of sleep -dependent memory consolidation, on a laptop prior to the onset of 
sleep and then tested [ADDRESS_739159] involves pressing four keys with the fingers of the 
left hand, repeating a five digit sequence ( e.g., 4-1-3-2-4) "as quickly and accura tely as 
possible" for 30 seconds. During both the training (night time) and test sessions (morning), 
participants will perform twelve 30 -second tappi[INVESTIGATOR_562426] a 30 
second break. During tappi[INVESTIGATOR_562427], the computer screen will b e green with the numeric 
sequence displayed at the top, and dots appearing from left to right beneath the sequence with 
each keystroke. During the breaks, the display will be red, and instead of showing the 
sequence, numbers (displayed as words) counted do wn the seconds until the next trial. Three 
seconds before the display turns green, the words will be replaced by [CONTACT_562446]. We will measure the number of correct sequences per [ADDRESS_739160] three training trials. Participants 
will be paid a bonus of $0.[ADDRESS_739161] sequence.  
 
Psychomotor Vigilance Task  (PVT) : is a highly sensitive assay of vigilant attention used 
commonly in the study of sleep disruption after each night of sleep. [ADDRESS_739162] a black screen. After a variable delay (chosen randomly to last 
between 2 to 10 seconds) a digital millisecond counter will begin inside the rectangle.  
The subject will be asked to stop the timer as qu ickly as they can by [CONTACT_258289]. At 
this time, the subject can view his/her reaction time, which serves as feedback for that trial.  
 
Instruction is given to avoid premature button presses during the variable inter -stimulus interval. 
If such a false start occurs, the subject will be asked to wait for the timer to begin before 
pressing the space bar and a new trial will commence. Trials of this nature repeat throughout a 
[ADDRESS_739163]: 
 
Protocol Version 11/09 /2017 Page 10 of 13  
Welcome. In this task, a rectangle will appear in the center of the screen. After a delay of 
variable duration, a counter will begin inside this rectangle. Your job is to press the 
SPACEBAR as rapi[INVESTIGATOR_562428]. Hitting the spacebar will stop 
the timer; you will then have a chance to view your speed. Aim for low numbers, but be 
sure not to press the spacebar before the timer starts! The task will continue for [ADDRESS_739164] finish ed.       
 
From this task we will analyze outcome measures such as the median reaction time, the 
variability of these reaction times, the occurrence of "lapses," (response times over 500 ms) 
errors of commission ("false -starts"), and a measure of performan ce degradation through time. 
The subject will perform this test before and after sleep  on each study day.  
 
fMRI Visit : This visit may occur at any time during the course of the study. Concomitant to the 
registration of the EEG, subjects will participate in  an fMRI scan to aid in source localization for 
data analysis. The study subject will arrive at the Martinos Center for Biological Imaging and a 
urine sample will be obtained for a toxic substance screen and for female study subjects a urine 
pregnancy test . The subjects will undergo approximately [ADDRESS_739165] will be able to verbally communicate with the investigators during the 
structural MRI portion.  MR images of the brain w ill be acquired using the Siemens 3 Tesla Tim 
Trio scanner or the Siemens 3 Tesla Biograph mMR scanner. Head motion will be minimized 
during the image acquisition by [CONTACT_2363] a foam head holder. When applicable, the study subjects 
will be instructed to lie s till during the imaging protocol.  
 
Inter-modality coordinate system co -registration : The structural MRI will be registered with the 
locations of the EEG sensors using a Polhemus FASTRAK digitizing system.  Using this 
digitizing system fiducial landmarks ( periauricular points, nasion), EEG electrode locations, and 
the head outline are digitized in 3D space, and then registered with the study subject’s structural 
MRI in order to construct an anatomical ly accurate EEG forward model ( Hari and Lounasmaa, 
1989).   
 
BIOSTATISTICAL ANALYS IS 
Neurophysiological endpoint:  Using an endpoint of total sleep time to guide sample size 
calculations. Our null hypothesis is the average within subject difference in total sleep time for 
dexmedetomidine compared with zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_562429]. Alternative hypothesis is the average within 
subject difference in total sleep time for dexmedetomidine compared with zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_258278] 1.[ADDRESS_739166] a clinically relevant improvement in total 
sleep time if we successfully enroll only 8 insomnia patients.  
 
Behavioral e ndpoint:  Using an endpoint of performance score on the word -pair task word -pair 
task (a cognitive exercise that tests the interaction of sleep and interference learning on long -
term memory consolidation) to guide sample size determination. Our null hypothe sis is the 
average within subject difference in performance score for dexmedetomidine compared with 
zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_562429]. Our alternative hypothesis is the average within subject difference in 
performance score for dexmedetomidine compared with zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_258278] 3. If we assume that the 
variance in performance score is 9, a type I error of 0.[ADDRESS_739167], the sample size determinations for our study are 7 and 9 respectively.

RISK AND DISCOMFORT  
Dexmedetomidine Risks : The risks involved in the administration of dexmedetomidine include 
nausea, xerostomia, atrial fibrillation, and transient  hypertension during drug loading. The 
significant risks involved are directly related to a drug induced reduction in sympathetic activity, 
resulting in hypotension and bradycardia. Rare case reports of sinus arrest in instances of rapid 
drug administratio n and in patients with a high resting vagal tone have also been described. 
Drug discontinuation, dose reduction, or the use of vasoactive substances causes a return of 
these hemodynamic parameters to baseline. As such, study subject hemodynamic parameters 
will be continuously monitored to ensure that appropriate medical intervention will be instituted 
for any clinically significant hypotensive or bradycardic epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841].   
Zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_562430] : The most common side effects associated with the administration of zolpi [INVESTIGATOR_562431], headache, and drowsiness. Actual frequency of these effects may be dosage 
form, dose, and/or age dependent.  
  
Polysomnography risks : Electrodes placed on the scalp may cause temporary redness.  
 
MRI risks: Risks already established for MR I include claustrophobia due to confinement of the 
patient in the system, malfunction of electromagnetic implants caused by [CONTACT_562447], projectiles and tissue burns caused by [CONTACT_334721], risks to the 
fetus of a p regnant patient, surface burns due to interaction of metallic system components or 
surface adhesives with the patients skin, slight hearing impairment due to high acoustic noise 
levels generated by [CONTACT_1190], and slight neuromuscular twitching (for the hi gher field strength 
systems).   However, system safeguards have been designed and operating guidelines have 
been provided to minimize any of the aforementioned risks.  
 
POTENTIAL BENEFITS  
There are no direct benefits to the individual subjects involved in this study. The potential 
benefits of this study to society are a clearer understanding of the potential benefit of 
dexmedetomidine as a therapy for insomnia compared with the established therapy zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_6730]. 
We hope to also gain insight into the extent of wh ich dexmedetomidine affects the sleep 
architecture of healthy subjects. If successful, this study may lead to the identification of a new 
class of medications for sleep therapy.  
 
MONITORING AND QUALITY ASSURANCE  
All EEG data will be stored for later off -line analysis. Unanticipated problems involving risks to 
subjects or others including adverse events will be reported to the PHRC in accordance with 
PHRC unanticipated problems including adverse events reporting guidelines.  
 
An anesthesiologist will monitor  the study subject throughout the time he/she is receiving 
intravenous drug infusions (dexmedetomidine), and for one hour thereafter. This is in 
accordance with MGH Department of Anesthesia, Critical Care, and Pain Medicine (DACCPM) 
standards for monitorin g during procedural sedation at an out -of-operating room location and 
the standards for monitoring in the post -anesthesia care unit. A DACCPM provided emergency 
airway bag and supplemental oxygen tanks will be made available on all active study nights , as 
well as an MGH pharmacy emergency medicine kit containing  glycopyrrolate, atropi[INVESTIGATOR_050], and 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] . Study personnel will also be required to perform mock emergency drills on all study 
nights.

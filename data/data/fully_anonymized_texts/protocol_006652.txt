brief behavioral treatment for depression (Engage) combined with video social support (PRISM 
2.0) among socially isolated/lonely case management clients who endorse depressive 
symptoms. Secondarily, we will assess technology -related outcomes.  
 
We plan to recruit [ADDRESS_444155] 3  subjects per month 
(17 months).   Eligible participants will be offered the combination of Engage and Prism 2.0, 
called Engage -Prism.  
 
  
1.2. Hypotheses / Research Questions  
   
We hypothesize that the intervention will be acceptable by [CONTACT_356413], perceived social support, and reduce loneliness and depressive symptoms.  
 
2. Background  and Significance  
 
Older adults who are homebound are socially disconnected with high rates of loneliness and depression. 
Social isolation places individuals  at risk of all -cause mobility and mortality (Holt -Lunstad & Hawkley 
2016) including suicidal attempts (Calati et al., 2019). In the Health and Retirement study social 
disconnectedness is associated with 5% risk of falls, and social isolation combined with  loneliness is 
associated with a 33% increase in falls (Quach & Burr, 2020). In a sample of 1,885 homebound and semi -
homebound older adults from the National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS) 15.62% scored 
above the suicide risk cutoff, 23.73% of homeb ound older adults reported a history of suicidal ideation 
or behavior, 65 adults in this sample (13.18%) indicated the possibility of attempting suicide in the 
future (Xiang & Brooks, 2017).  Social isolation and depression may be bidirectional (Santini et  al, Lancet 
2020). Aging services providers are not trained to distinguish loneliness, depression and disconnection 
making links to appropriate services challenging (Choi NG, Sirey JA, Bruce ML, 2013).  
 
Brief behavioral interventions have shown an increase  in social interaction, a decrease in loneliness, 
depression and disability (Choi and Bruce, 2020). Engage is a brief therapy designed to offer a 
structured, stepped approach and interventions to reduce barriers to increased engagement with 
rewarding activ ities to improve depression (Alexopoulos et al, 2020). The goal is to increase 
participation in meaningful activities. Recent research supports the importance of engagement in social 
interpersonal -individual predicting subsequent increases in behavioral ac tivation and improvement of 
depression (Solomonov et al, 2019).  Homebound older adults have limited social interaction given their 
restricted mobility and medical burden. Innovative steps to improve interactions have used technology 
to link clients who ar e homebound. In an intervention targeting social engagement with a technology 
intervention (PRISM 2.0), participants reported increased social support, decreased loneliness, increased 
feelings of well -being, more positive attitudes about computers, and gai ns in computer proficiency 
(Czaja et al., 2017). These gains were maintained improvements at 12 month follow -up.

 3. Study Design  and Methods  
 
3.1 Overall Design  
 
The study will include the following steps:  
1. Referral from case management service , determination of eligibility, collection of informed 
consent  
2. Baseline assessment and training with the Engage -Prism technology  
3. 9 Engage sessions (1 per week) and use of the Prism platform (9 weeks total)  
4. Brief interim assessments at [ADDRESS_444156] -ther apy assessment and follow -up interview at week 9  
6. Follow -up assessment at week 12  
Details related to the questionnaires in the baseline and Week 9assessment as well as the follow -up 
interview are described in the subsequent sections . 
 
3.2 Baseline assessment/training, Engage sessions, technology use, post -study assessment and 
interview   
 
3.2.[ADDRESS_444157]. Trainings will occur virtually (via Zoom or telephone) or in -
person.  In-person training will be conducted by [CONTACT_356414]’ 
home as many are homebound. The determination for in -person versus virtual training will be 
based on the preference of the participant the research regulations of W eill Cornell Medicine 
pertaining to the on -going COVID -19 pandemic. Following the training, baseline questionnaire 
data will be collected with the study team member reading the questions aloud and marking the 
responses of the participant. Included question naires are described in the subsequent section.  
 
 
3.2.2 Questionnaires   
  
Questionnaires collected during the baseline and study assessments include (attached to IRB 
application):  
1. Hamilton Depression Rating Scale  (HAMD)  for depression severity  
2. Behavioral Activation for Depression Scale  (BADS)  for behavioral activation * 
3. Duke social interaction subscale – to assess social connection  
4. Duke perceived support subscale  – to assess perceived social support  
5. UCLA 3 -item scale – to assess loneliness  
6.  12-item World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule (WHODAS 2.0) - to 
assess different domains of disability**

12. Intent to Participate – to assess intention to continue study  
*Pre and post only (i.e. not at 3, 6 or 9 weeks)  
**Pre only  
 
3.2.3. Engage th erapy sessions  
 
Participants will complete 9 Engage therapy sessions . Engage is a form of  personalized, stepwise 
treatment for late -life depression. The main intervention of Engage is an adapted  form of 
behavioral activation tailored to older adults  focused on “reward exposure,” namely 
encouraging  patients to engage in (i.e., expose themselves to)  rewarding activities between 
sessions to enhance activation of the reward system. At each session, patients  will be  guided to 
select a rewarding activity th ey had  not engaged in recently or wanted to do more often.  Then, 
the clinician will help  patients develop a plan to  engage in the selected activity and to cope with  
potential difficulties when exposed to such rewarding  situations. If a patient does  not 
successfully engage in  planned rewarding activities and show clinical  improvement by [CONTACT_356415], the clinician will add techniques to address barriers to reward exposure  (Solmonov et al, 
2019). Weekly depression severity is tracked using the PHQ -9. Engage has previously 
demonstrated efficacy for decreasing depressive symptoms in older adults (Alexopoulos et al, 
2016).   
 
3.2.4. Prism system  
 
Throughout the 12-week study , participants will be given the Prism 2.[ADDRESS_444158] demonstrated that Prism system reduces 
loneliness and increases perceived social support and computer proficiency (Czaja et al., 2017).  
Prism software includes: Internet browser access (with vetted links to site s such as 
NIHSeniorHealth.Gov), an annotated resource guide, a dynamic classroom feature, a calendar, a 
photo feature, E -mail, games, and online help . Clinicians will incorporate elements of the Prism 
system into therapy as appropriate, and participants wi ll be instructed to use the Prism system 
at their leisure or as it pertains to their chosen “reward exposure” activities.  
 
3.2.[ADDRESS_444159] -study interviews  
 
Following completion of week 9 questionnaires, participants will discuss semi -structured 
interview ques tions with a study team member related to barriers and facilitators to the Engage 
therapy and use of the Prism technology platform (script attached). Interviews will be audio 
recorded with the consent of the participant.

 This will be recorded by [CONTACT_356419]. No personal information will be stored for ineligible persons or persons who do not 
consent to participate. Only descriptives regarding whether or not the person contact[CONTACT_356420]. This will  be recorded by [CONTACT_356421].  
 
 
6.1.2. Questionnaires  (baseline and post -study)  
 
 Personnel conducting the study will verbally ask questions  of contained in the questionnaires 
described , and  record the participants answers using pen/paper or electronic form . Study 
investigators will write the participant number on each questionnaire so questionnaires from 
the same participant can be matched.  Assessments will be collected prior to the first Engage 
session  and following the final Engage session.  
 
 6.1.3. Expert assessment  
 
Weekly depression severity is tracked using the PHQ -[ADDRESS_444165] satisfaction participating in 
Engage -Prism  using the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ 3 -item) . 
 
6.1.4. Technology utilization  
 
The Prism system collects de -identified statistics regarding the frequency and duration of 
utilization of each of the Prism applications  (e.g. calendar, web browser, classroom), but does 
not collect surveillance data such as message content or search history. The data is stored on a 
secure, encrypted server where only study team members will have access.  
 
As described above, i f participants do not “log on” to the Prism system for [ADDRESS_444166] protected logins.

compare the Engage -Prism participants  response and remission rates with the rates found in the 
CARE -D study. We expect equal response rates (33 -42.5% and remission rates (31 - 37.9%) 
(Alexopoulos, 2016)  
7. Regulatory Considerations  
 
7.1. Institutional Review Board/Ethics Committee Approval  
 
As required by [CONTACT_427], the Investigator will ensure all legal aspects are covered, and 
approval of the appropriate regulatory bodies obtained, before study initiation.  
Before initiation of the study at each study center, the protocol, the ICF, o ther written material 
given to the patients, and any other relevant study documentation will be submitted to the 
appropriate Ethics Committee. Written approval of the study and all relevant study information 
must be obtained before the study center can be initiated or the IP is released to the Investigator. 
Any necessary extensions or renewals of IEC/IRB approval must be obtained for changes to the 
study, such as amendments to the protocol, the ICF, or other study documentation. The written 
approval of the IEC/IRB together with the approved ICF mus t be filed in the study files.  
The Investigator will report promptly to the IEC/IRB any new information that may adversely 
affect the safety of the subject s or the conduct of the study. The Investigator will submi t written 
summaries of the study status to the IEC/IRB as required. On completion of the study, the IEC/IRB 
will be notified that the study has ended.  
 
All agreed protocol amendments will be clearly recorded on a protocol amendment form and will 
be signed  and dated by [CONTACT_86317]. All protocol amendments will 
be submitted to the relevant institutional IEC/IRB for approval before implementation, as 
required by [CONTACT_427]. The only exception will be when the amendment i s necessary to 
eliminate an immediate hazard to the trial participants. In this case, the necessary action will be 
taken first, with the relevant protocol amendment following shortly thereafter.  
Once protocol amendments or consent form modifications are i mplemented at the lead site, Weill 
Cornell Medicine, updated documents will be provided to participating sites. Weill Cornell 
Medicine must approve all consent form changes prior to local IRB submission.

 Relevant study documentation will be submitted to t he regulatory authorities of the participating 
countries, according to local/national requirements, for review and approval before the beginning 
of the study. On completion of the study, the regulatory authorities will be notified that the study 
has ended.   
 
7.2. Ethical Conduct of the Study  
The Investigators and all parties involved will conduct this study in adherence to the ethical 
principles based on the Declaration of Helsinki, GCP, ICH guidelines and the applicable national 
and local laws and regulatory requirements.  
 
This study will be conducted under a protocol reviewed and approv ed by [CONTACT_356422], where the benefits of the study are in proportion to the risks.  
 
7.3 Informed Consent  
 
Patients will provide verbal informed consent (script and information sheet attached).

subjects’ medical records and other source documentation will be kept for the maximum time 
permitted by [CONTACT_5035][INVESTIGATOR_307], institution, or medical practice.  
 
8. Statistical Considerations  
 
8.1 Sample Size/Accrual Rate  
 
The goal of this early -stage pi[INVESTIGATOR_356411], acceptability and impact of a 
brief behavioral treatment for depression (Engage) combined with social support (P rism ). Though 
we have planned statistical hypothesis testing  for a comparison with a historical sample , our goal is 
not to demonstrate definitive significant differences or establish  but understand whether this is a 
feasible, acceptable, promising intervention that warrants further exploration with a larger sample 
of participants. The sample size is based on previous work by [CONTACT_356423] (Alexopoulos et al., 2016).

 2. SYNOPSIS  
Title of study:  A Phase 3, Randomized, Double -Blind, Pla cebo -Controlled Study to Assess the Efficacy, 
Safety, and Tolerability of Valbenazine for the Treatment of Chorea Associated with Huntington Disease  
Study number:  NBI-[ZIP_CODE]-HD3005 
Study site(s):  Approximately 55 study sites in the [LOCATION_002]  and Canada . 
Primary Study Objectives:  
• Evaluate the efficacy of valbenazine to reduce chorea associated with Huntington disease (HD)  using 
the Unified Huntington ’s Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS) Total Maximal Chorea (TMC) score. 
Secondary Study Objectives:  
• Evaluate the efficacy of valbenazine to reduce chorea associated with HD using the Clinical Global 
Impression of Change (CGI -C), the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGI -C), and the Quality of 
Life in Neurological Disorders ( Neuro -QoL) Upper Extremity Function Short Form and the Neuro -
QoL Lower Extremity Function Short Form . 
• Evaluate the safety and tolerability of valbenazine in subjects with HD.  
 
  
Study design:  This is a Phase 3, randomized, double -blind, placebo- controlled study to evaluate the efficacy, 
safety, and tolerability of valbenazine in subjects with HD.  The study includes a 4- week screening period, an 
8-week dose -adjustm ent period, a 4- week maintenance period, and a final study visit [ADDRESS_158444] HD and a 
genetic diagnosis of HD will be enrolled . 
If individual in -person study visits at the study site  are not possible due to Corona Virus Disease 2019 
(COVID-19) related reasons (eg, subject is not able to travel to the site for safety reasons or as part of public 
health measures ), remote visits may b e conducted on a case-by- case basis at the judgment of the investigator 
and in consultation with the study medical monitor; once able, the subject is to return to in- person visits at the 
study site. Screening, baseline, and study visits at Weeks [ADDRESS_158445] be performed at the study site ; subjects 
who plan on entering Study NBI -[ZIP_CODE]- HD3006 the sa me day as Study NBI-[ZIP_CODE]- HD3005 Week [ADDRESS_158446] Week 14 follow -up performed at the study site . 
Before subjects can provide informed consent, the investigator  (or designee) must determine whether the subject 
has the capacity to provide consent for study participation using the University of [LOCATION_004], San Diego Brief 
Assessment of Capacity to Consent (UBACC).  Only subjects who are deemed to have the capacity to provide 
consent may sign the informed consent form (ICF).  All subjects must sign an ICF prior to the conduct of any 
study- related procedures.  Subjects will be screened for eligibility during a screening period, which will be up  to 
4 weeks  (28 days) prior to Day -1.  Screening visit must be performed at the study site .  Screening assessments 
may be repeated during the screening period if  approved by [CONTACT_10542].  A subject who has 
been deemed a screen fail ure may be rescreened  if approved by [CONTACT_10542]; during rescreening, 
all procedures must be conducted with the exception of Cytosine Adenine Guanine repeat (provided the results are available from a prior screening period).  
Eligible subjects  will b e randomized 1:1 to either valbenazine or placebo treatment on Day - 1 (baseline).  Study 
drug will be administered in a blinded fashion throughout the 12- week treatment period beginning on Day 1.  
The baseline visit must be performed at the study site .  The maximum dose s during each week of the treatment 
period are shown in the table below.

Clinical Protocol Amendment No. [ADDRESS_158447]’s dose to the next dose level if, in the 
investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], the subject has tolerated the study drug at the current dose.  Doses will be adjusted in a 
blinded manner; subjects receiving placebo will undergo the dose -adjustment process but will continue to 
receive placebo.  Dose increases are allowed at visits at the end  of Weeks 2, 4, and 6.  If the subject has not 
tolerated the current dose, the investigator may decrease the subject’s dose at any time during the dose 
adjustment period (the 40 mg dose can be decreased to 20 mg) .  Doses are to be decreased [ADDRESS_158448] multiple dose decreases during the dose -adjustment period; subjects who are unable to 
tolerate the [ADDRESS_158449] had a dose decrease may re- escalate during the dose adjustment period if the investigator considers  that the 
dose increase would  be reasonably tolerated .  
During the maintenance period (beginning after the Week 8 visit through the end of Week 12), the subject’s 
dose will be maintained.  If the subject cannot tolerate the maintenance dose, the investigator may reduce the 
subject’s dose a single time by 1 dose level  (unless the subject is receiving 20 mg) ; if the subject cannot tolerate 
the lower dose, he/she should remain in the study but study drug dosing will be discontinued.   Study visits  at 
Weeks  [ADDRESS_158450] experiences an adverse event (AE) that is (1) deemed associated with the study drug, and 
(2) of either moderate or severe intensity, or a serious AE.
Follow- up assessments will be conducted at the end of Wee k 14 ([ADDRESS_158451] dose of the study drug).   
Subjects who withdraw from the study should have an early termination visit, which has the same assessments 
as the Week 12 visit.  
If individual in -person study visits at the study site are not possible  due to COVID -19 related reasons, study 
visits during the dose adjustment period, the early termination visit, and Week 14 follow -up visit may be 
performed remotely  at the judgment of the investigator and in consultation with the study medical monitor.  
Study drug will be self -administered (in the presence of the subject’s caregiver, if applicable) once daily (qd)  
beginning on Day 1.  Study drug should be administered at approximately the same time each day during the 
study.  As much as possible, all study vi sits (including baseline and follow -up) should occur at approximately 
the same time to standardize the time of day for the assessment of efficacy, safety, and drug exposure.  Visits 
during the treatment period and the follow -up visit will have a window of ±[ADDRESS_158452] (DSMB) will periodically review ongoing, unblinded 
clinical safety data to ensure the safety and well -being of the study subjects.  
Study population:  A total of approximately [ADDRESS_158453] HD  will be enrolled.  Of  the approximately 120 subjects enrolled in 
the main study, approximately 50 subjects will be enrolled in the exploratory substudy with wearable movement sensors.  
Duration of treatment and study participation:  The expected duration of study participation  for each subject 
is approximately 18 weeks, including up to 4 weeks  (28 days) of screening, a 12- week treatment period, and a 
follow- up visit [ADDRESS_158454], dosage, and mode of administration:  Valbenazine will be supplied as orally 
administered capsules containing 20 or 40 mg of valbenazine (free base equivalents as the ditosylate salt).  
Subjects must swallow the capsules with approximately 4 ounces of water or other liquid, with or without food.  
The table below shows the doses and capsules that will be used in the study.

5. INTRODUCTION  
5.1. Background 
Huntington disease (HD) is a genetic progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized 
clinically by [CONTACT_139543], cognitive dysfunction, and psychiatric symptoms.  Pathologically, HD is associated with brain atrophy characterized by [CONTACT_139544][INVESTIGATOR_139530].  Neurochemically, alterations in dopamine function and neurotransmission is observed in HD patients, with increased dopamine neurotransmission observed with early stage HD symptoms manifesting as hyperkinetic abnormal involuntary movements.  Later stage motor symptoms are primarily hypokinetic in nature (Frank, 2014; Cepeda et al., 2014). 
Patients with HD typi[INVESTIGATOR_139531] 30 to 50 years of age.  Five 
to 10% of cases are classified as juvenile onset, with patients becoming symptomatic before the 
age of 20.  The average lifespan after symptom onset is 15 to 20 years (Frank, 2014; Roos, 2010). 
One of the defining motor symptoms of HD is chorea, characterized as abnormal, abrupt, 
irregular, nonstereotyped movements (Thorley et al., 2018).  As HD progresses, chorea can 
increase in frequency and amplitude ( Carlozzi et al., 2016).  Chorea is also assoc iated with 
decreased quality of life (Carlozzi et al., 2016).  While there is no established treatment to delay onset or progression of HD, treatment of HD-associated chorea could benefit some patients through improved quality of life (Thorley et al., 2018). 
Valbenazine’s pharmacological activity is primarily derived from its highly selective and potent 
major metabolite, [+]-α -dihydrotetrabenazine ([+]-α -HTBZ ) (Grigoriadis et al., 2017 ).  
Valbenazine and [+] -α-HTBZ have relatively long half -lives of 15 to 22 hours, allowing for once 
daily dosing with consistent exposure to [+]-α -HTBZ, and more stable management of 
hyperkinetic movements.

 with the exception of Cytosine Adenine Guanine repeat (CAG; provided the results are available 
from a prior screening period).   
Eligible subjects  will b e randomized 1:1 to either valbenazine or placebo on Day -1 (baseline).  
Study drug will be administered in a blinded fashion throughout the 12-week  treatment period 
beginning on Day 1.  The maximum doses during each week of the treatment period are shown 
in Table 1.

 Dose Adjustment Period  Maintenance Period  
Week  1-[ADDRESS_158463]’s dose to the next dose level if, in the investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], the subject has tolerated the study drug at the current dose.  Doses will be adjusted in a blinded manner; subjects  receiving placebo will undergo the 
dose-adjustment process but will continue to receive placebo.  Dose increases are allowed at visits at the end of Weeks 2, 4, and 6.  If the subject has not tolerated the current dose, the investigator may decrease the subject’s dose at any time during the dose adjustment period  (the 
40 mg dose can be decreased to 20 mg).  Doses are to be decreased [ADDRESS_158464] multiple dose decreases during the dose-adjustment period; subjects who are unable to tolerate the [ADDRESS_158465] had a dose decrease may re-escalate during the dose adjustment period if the investigator considers that the dose increase would be reasonably 
tolerated .   
During the maintenance period (beginning after the Week 8 visit through the end of Week 12), the subject’s dose will be maintained.  If the subject cannot tolerate the maintenance dose, the investigator may reduce the subject’s dose a single time by 1 dose level (unless the subject is receiving 20 mg); if the subject cannot tolerate the lower dose, he/she should remain in the stud y 
but study drug dosing will be discontinued.   
During the dose-adjustment and maintenance periods, the investigator may assess that a dose 
level is not tolerated if a subject experiences an adverse event (AE) that is (1) deemed associated 
with the study drug, and (2) of either moderate or severe intensity, or a serious AE. 
Follow-up assessments will be conducted at the end of Week 14 ([ADDRESS_158466] dose of 
the study drug).  Subjects who withdraw from the study should have an early termination visit, which has the same assessments as the Week 12 visit.   
Study drug will be self- administered (in the presence of the subject’s caregiver, if applicable) 
once daily (qd) beginning on Day 1.  Study drug should be administered at approximately the same time each day during the study.  As much as possible, all study visits (including baseline and follow-up) should occur at approximately the same time to standardize the time of day for the assessment of efficacy, safety, and drug exposure.  Visits during the treatment period and the follow-up visit will have a window of ±[ADDRESS_158467] (DSMB) will periodically review ongoing,

9.2.3. Swallowing Disturbance Ques tionnaire 
The SDQ is a 15-item instrument that assesses subjects’ difficulty in swallowing  food on a scale 
from 0 (never) to 3 (very frequently).  The SDQ is a valid and reliable instrument to determine 
subjects’ ability to swallow ( Cohen and Manor, 2011).  The SDQ will be administered at 
screening to determine eligibility for the study.  
9.2.4. Clinical Rating Scale for Progressive Supranuclear Palsy  
Subjects who score ≥11 on the SDQ during screening and, in the investigator’s judgement, may still be eligible for participation , will be asked to complete item 13 on the CRS -PSP.  Dysphagia 
is rated from 0 (none) to 4 (requires artificial measures) after the subject drinks 30 to 50 mL of water (Golbe and Ohman -Strickland, 2007).  Subjects who score ≤2 will be eligible for the study.  
9.2.5. Montreal Cognitive Assessment  
The Montreal Cognitive Assessment ( MoC A) is a n instrument to determine cognitive abilities 
including:  orientation, short-term memory, executive function, language abilities, abstraction, animal naming, attention, and a clock -drawing test (Nasreddine et al., 2005).  The maximum 
score on the instrument is 30 points.  The MoCA will be administered on Day -1 (baseline). 
9.3. Efficacy Assessments  
If individual in-person study visits at the study site are not possible due to COVID-19 related reasons (eg, subject is not able to travel to the site for safety  reasons or as part of public health 
measures), remote visits may be conducted on a case-by- case basis at the judgment of the

return to in-person visits at the study site  (see Appendix A ).   
9.3.1. Unified Huntington’s Disease Rating Scale  
The UHDRS is a tool developed by [CONTACT_139546] (HSG) to assess the clini cal 
features and course of HD.  The UHDRS has undergone extensive reliability and validity testing and has been used as a major outcome measure in controlled clinical trials ( HSG, 1996).  The 
full UHDRS includes the following assessments:  motor, cognitive, behavioral, independence, function, and TFC.  The motor portion of the UHDRS consists of 15 items that measure the severity of the motor symptoms.  
The TMC is item 12 of the motor assessment and m easures the chorea in 7 different body parts 
including the face, oral-buccal-lingual region, trunk and each limb independently.  The maximum score is 28.  
The full UHDRS will be administered Day -1 (baseline) and Weeks 12 (or early termination) and 14.  The motor and behavior portions of the UHDRS will be administered at screening (including TFC), Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10.  The motor only portion of the UHDRS will be video recorded at screening, Day -1 (baseline), and Weeks 10  and 12 (or early termination). 
The motor and cognition portions of the UHDRS will not be administered at COVID-19 related remote visits.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Unified Huntington’s Disease Rating Scale Administrator 
The UHDRS will be administered and scored by [CONTACT_093] (or qualified designee).  If 
possible, the same person should administer the UHDRS for an individual subject at all timepoints.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Unified Huntington’s Disease Rating Scale Video Recording  
Subjects will be video recorded for the duration of the UHDRS motor section  according to 
standardized guidelines provided by [CONTACT_11148] (or designee).  Video recordings will be uploaded to a secure, central server, and managed by a core laboratory.  Access to the dedicated central server 
will be limited and will require the user to provide a user identificatio n and password to access 
the secure server and the subject’s video recording.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Blinded, Central Unified Huntington’s Disease Rating Scale Motor Video Raters 
The UHDRS video recording files will be reviewed and scored by [CONTACT_11136], central UHDRS 
motor video r aters.  A triple-blind consensus scoring will be conducted by [CONTACT_139547].  NBI (or designee) will provide the blinded central 
UHDRS motor video raters digital -secure access
 to the subjects’ randomized UHDR S video 
recording files for review and scor ing.  The central raters will score maximal chorea (0 to 4) on 
7 body regions (face, buccal-oral-lingual, trunk, right upper extremities, left upper extremities, right lower extremities, and left lower extremities ).  The central raters will be blinded to the 
subjects’ study visits and treatment assignments.  Two blinded, central raters will review each UHDRS video file from beginning to end and must agree on the T MC score.  The central

Day -1 (baseline), and Weeks 10 and 12 (or early termination).  
9.3.2. Patient Global Impression of Change  
Subjects will evaluate the change in their chorea symptoms since initiation of study drug dosing 
by [CONTACT_139548] 7 responses (very much improved, much improved, minimally improved, not changed, minimally worse, much worse, and very much worse) on the PGI-C.   
The PGI -C will be completed by [CONTACT_139549] 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 (or early termination), and 
14. 
9.3.3. Clinical Global Impression of Change  
The CGI -C, which is based on a 7-point scale (range:  1=very much improved to 7=very much 
worse), will be used to rate the overall global improvement of chorea since the initiation of study 
drug dosing.  This scale is a modification of a scale developed by [CONTACT_139550]’s overall improvement in clinical disorder and provides a global evaluation of improvement over time from the clinician’s perspective ( Guy, 1976). 
An investigator or qualified clinician designee (eg, psychologist or social worker) will rate the scale at the scheduled timepoints.  If possible, the same person s hould rate the CGI- C at all 
timepoints.  The CGI -C will be administered  at Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 (or early termination), 
and 14. 
This assessment will not be conducted at  COVID-19 related remote visit s. 
9.3.4. Patient Global Impression of Severity  
The Patient G lobal Impression of Severity (PGI-S) scale will be used to assess overall severity of 
chorea on a 5-point scale (range:  1= none to 5=very severe).  The PGI -S will be assessed by [CONTACT_100697] -1 (baseline) and at Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 (or early termination), and 14. 
9.3.5. Clinical Global Impression of Severity  
The Clinical Global Impression of Severity (CGI -S) scale will be used to assess overall severity 
of chorea on a 7-point scale (range:  1=normal, not at all ill  to 7=among the most extremely ill  
patient).  The CGI -S will be assessed by [CONTACT_98203] -1 (baseline) and at Weeks 2, 4, 
6, 8, 10, 12 (or early termination), and 14. 
This assessment will not be conducted at  COVID-19 related remote visit s. 
9.3.6. Short Form 36 Health Survey  
The SF -36 is a 36-item, self -administered questionnaire.  It measures health on 8 dimensions:  
vitality, physical functioning, pain, general health perception, physical role limitations , 
emotional role functioning, social functioning, and mental health ( Brazier et al. , 1992).  The 
SF-36 has been shown to be a reliable and validated  instrument (Brazier et al., 1992).  Version 2 
of the SF-36 will be used in this study. 
Neurocrine Biosciences, Inc., Study No. NBI -[ZIP_CODE]-HD3005 
Clinical Proto col Amendment No.  5 Final Version  
12 April 2021  Confidential  32 The SF -36 will be administered on Day -1 (baseline) and Week 12 (or early termination). 
This assessment  will not be conducted at  a COVID-19 related remote early termination visit.  
9.3.7. Quality of Life in Neurological Disorders  
The Neuro-QoL  is a collection of psychometrically sound, clinically relevant, health -related 
quality of life measurement tools for individuals with neurological conditions.  The Neuro-QoL  
has been demonstrated to be a reliable tool for assessing patient -reported physical functioning 
measures in subjects with HD ( Carlozzi et al., 2017 ).  The Lower Extremity Function Short Form 
and the Upper Extremity Function Short Form each comprise 8 ques tions about physical 
abilities, rated from 1 (unable to do) to 5 (without any difficulty). 
Both the Upper Extremity Function Short Form and the Lower Extremity Function Short Form 
will be administered on Day -1 (baseline), and Weeks 4, 8, 10, 12 (or early termination), and 14.  
9.3.8. Huntington Disease Health Index  
The Huntington Disease Health Index (HD-HI) (Glidden et al., 2017) is a disease-specific patient 
reported outcome measure designed to evaluate patient disease burden in therapeutic trials.  The HD-HI comprises 13 subscales that measure 13 individual areas of HD patient health. Together, 
each of the subscales can be utilized to generate an estimate of a HD patient’s overall disease burden.  Each question in the instrument was selected based on its high relevance to the HD population, its ability to be consistently understood by [CONTACT_139551], its content validity, its face validity, and its potential responsiveness to measure therapeutic benefit of disease progression during clinical trials. 
This instrument is a questionnaire that is completed by [CONTACT_423] (with assistance, as 
necessary).  In standard use, the instrument is handed to a subject who is asked to read the 
directions and complete the instrument, using a pen, by [CONTACT_139552].  
Upon completion of the HD-HI, 14 scores are generated: a subject receives a score for each of the [ADDRESS_158477] disease burden and a score of 0 representing no disease burden. 
The HD -HI will be administered on Day -1 (baseline) and Weeks 10 and 12 (or early 
termination).  
This assessment will not be conducted at  COVID-19 related remote visit s. 
9.3.9. EuroQol 5 Dimensions 5 Levels 
The EuroQol 5 Dimensions 5 Levels (EQ -5D-5L) is a general, single index measure for 
describing and valuing health (Herdman et al., 2011).  It defines health in terms of 5 dimensions:  
Mobility, Self-Care, Usual Activities, Pain/Discomfort, and Anxiety/Depression.  Each dimension has 5 levels:  no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and extreme problems.  The subject indicates his/her health state by [CONTACT_139553].  The scores for the 5 dimensions can be combined into a 5 -digit

A medical history will be taken at the screening visit and updated on Day -1 (baseline) and as 
needed throughout the study.  
9.5.4. Physical Examination Including Height and Weight 
The complete physical examination will consist of an assessment of general appearance, skin and mucosae, head, eyes, ears, nose, throat, neck (including thyroid), lymph nodes, chest/lungs, cardiovascular, abdomen, extremities, musculoskeletal, and neurological system.   
A complete physical examination including weight will be performed at screening, Day -1 (baseline) , and Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 12 (or early termination), and 14.  Height will be measured at 
screening only.  Height and weight will be measured with subjects not wearing shoes. Physical examination including weight will not be performed at COVID-[ADDRESS_158478] 12-lead  ECG will be recorded in triplicate (at least 1 minute apart and within 
approximately 15 minutes) after the subject has rested supi[INVESTIGATOR_1919] 5 minutes.  The ECG 
parameters that will be assessed include heart rate, PR interval, QRS duration, QT interval, and QTcF (machine readings or calculated).  Additionally, the occurrence of de- and re-polarization and rhythm disorders or other abnormalities will be assessed.  If needed, the investigator may consult with a local or central cardiologist to assist in the interpretation of an  ECG.  Based on the 
review of these parameters, the investigator or designee will note if the ECG is Normal, Abnormal not Clinically Significant, or Abnormal Clinically Significant.  If the ECG is Abnormal Clinically Significant, the investigator or designee will provide a description of the abnormality recorded on the AE eCRF.   
The 12-lead ECG will be conducted at screening, Day -1 (baseline), and Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 (or early termination), and 14. 
9.5.6. Clinical Laboratory Assessments 
All clinical laboratory assessments will be performed by a central laboratory  or at a local 
laboratory as needed .  In addition, a urine pregnancy test will be performed by [CONTACT_139554] -1 (baseline) to confirm subject eligibility.  The central laboratory will provide instructions 
and supplies before study initiation and instructions will be included in a laboratory manual.  The laboratory test battery will include routine and screening laboratory tests.  Fasting is not required for the clinical laboratory assessments.   Select  clinical laboratory assessments may be performed 
by a local lab  (for re-testing or if the subject is not able to come to  the study site); prior approval 
by [CONTACT_139555] . 
The following clinical safety laboratory assays will be performed:  
Hematology:   complete blood count including WBC count with differential, red blood cell 
(RBC) count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, and platelet count, mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), red cell distribution width (RDW), and mean platelet volume (MPV).

Urinalysis:   specific gravity, nitrite, ketones, protein, urobilinogen, glucose, bilirubin, leukocyte 
esterase, occult blood, and pH; microscopic examination of sediment will be performed only if the results of the urinalysis dipstick evaluation are positive for nitrite, protein, leukocyte esterase, or blood. 
The following additional laboratory tests will be performed:  
Serology:  Blood will be collected for HIV-Ab, HBsAg, and HCV-Ab and reflex PCR testing at 
screening. 
Urine Drug Screen:  The urine drug s creen will test for amphetamines, barbiturates, 
benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], cocaine, phencyclidine, and opi[INVESTIGATOR_858].  The urine drug screen will be collected at screening  by [CONTACT_139556] a central laboratory . 
Pregnancy Test:  Pregnancy tests will be per formed throughout the study for female subjects of 
childbearing potential.  A serum (β -hCG) pregnancy test will be performed at screening  and 
urine pregnancy tests will be performed at subsequent visits . 
9.5.7. Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale  
The C-SSRS is a validated instrument to prospectively assess suicidal ideation and behavior (Posner et al., 2011).  There are versions of the questionnaire designed for use at screening (baseline/screening version) and at baseline and visits throughout the study (Since Last Visit version).  All versions of the C-SSRS include a series of screening questions related to suicidal ideation and suicidal behavior.  Subject responses of “yes” to one or more screening questions will prompt additional questions that evaluate frequency and intensity of suicidal ideation and/or behavior.  Subjects with any lifetime suicidal behavior or suicidal ideation of type 4 (active suicidal ideation with some intent to act, without specific plan) or type 5 (active suicidal ideation with specific plan and intent) in the 3 months  before screening based on the C-SSRS should be 
excluded (see exclusion criterion  #10). 
The C -SSRS will be administered and scored by [CONTACT_139557], Day -1 (baseline), and Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 (or early termination), and 14. 
9.5.8. Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale 
The Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale ( BARS ) is a validated four -item scale to assess the presence 
and severity of drug- induced akathisia ( Barnes, 1989).  This scale includes both objective items 
(eg, observed restlessness) and subjective items (eg, subjects ’ awareness of restlessness and 
related distress), together with a global assessment of akathisia.  Global assessment is made on a

akathisia; 5=severe akathisia).   
The BARS will be administered on Day -1 (baseline) and Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 (or early termination) . 
This assessment will not be conducted at COVID -19 related remote visits.  
9.5.9. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_139533] a commonly used instrument to determine the levels of anxiety and depression that 
a person is experiencing.  The HADS is a 14-item scale; 7 of the items relate to anxiety and 7 relate to depression ( Zigmond and Snaith, 1983).  Each item is answered on a 4-point  (0 to 3) 
response category so the possible scores range from 0 to 21 for anxiety and 0 to 21 for depression.  The HADS has been validated as a measure of depression and anxiety (Barczak  et al., 1988).  
The HADS will be administered at screening, Day -1 (baseline), and Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 (or early termination), and 14. 
9.5.10. Unified Huntington’s Disease Rating Scale  
A subset of the UHDRS Motor Assessment (items rating retropulsion pull test, finger taps, 
pronate/supi[INVESTIGATOR_139534], rigidity-arms, and bradykinesia-body) will be used to assess for parkinsonism at each visit.  
This assessment will not be conducted at COVID -19 related remote visits.  
9.6. Other Assessment  
9.6.1. Anosognosia Scale 
The Anosognosia Scale (AS) is an instrument to screen f or anosognosia in daily practice and is 
specific for HD (Deckel and Morrison, 1996).  This scale requires subjects and investigators to rate the subject’s ability to perform tasks relative to individuals of the subject’s age and education on a five-point s cale, rating [ADDRESS_158479] and the investigator (or designee) 
at Day -1 (baseline) and Weeks 12 (or early termination) and 14.  This assessment will not be performed at COVID-19 related remote visits. 
9.7. Specific Study Period Information 
After signing the ICF, subjects will undergo screening procedures within 4 weeks (28 days) of Day -1. 
If individual in-person study visits at the study site are not possible due to COVID-19 related 
reasons (eg, subject is not able to travel to the site for safety reasons or as part of public health measures), remote visits may be conducted on a case-by- case basis at the judgment of the

9.10.3. Sponsor’s Termination or Suspension of Study  
The Sponsor or designee reserves the right to close a study site, terminate or suspend the entire 
study, or terminate or suspend the study at individual sites, at any time for any reason. If the study is prematurely terminated or suspended, the Sponsor shall promptly inform the investigators, the Institutional Review Boards (IRBs)/Independent Ethics Committees (IECs), the regulatory authorities, and any contract research organizations (CROs) used in the study of the reason for termination or suspension, as specified by [CONTACT_1214]. The investigator shall promptly inform the subject and should assure appropriate therapy and/or follow-up. 
10. STUDY DRUG  
10.1. Study Drug Supplies  
10.1.1. Valbenazine  
NBI or its designee will provide the study site with a supply of study drug sufficient for the 
completion of the treatment period of the study.   
Valbenazine will be supp lied as orally administered capsules containing 20 or 40 mg of 
valbenazine (free base equivalents as the ditosylate salt).  Subjects must swallow the capsules  
(2 capsules)  with approximately 4 ounces of water or other liquid, with or without food.  The 
dosing regimens and valbenazine capsules that will be used in this study are shown in Table 3.

Matching placebo capsules are identical in appearance to valbenazine and will be orally 
administered in a double-blind manner (2 placebo capsules) on an identical schedule as valbenazine.  Subjects must swallow the capsules with approximately [ADDRESS_158485]  be stored at controlled room temperature ( ). 
Study drug must  be stored and inventoried according to applicable state and federal regulations 
and study procedures. 
10.3. Study Drug Packaging and Labeling 
All packaging and labeling operations will be performed according to Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) and GCP.  The study drugs will be sent to designated staff at the study site who must complete and return a drug supply confirmation to NBI or its design ee verifying the receipt 
of the drug.  Study drug will be labeled in accordance with federal and local regulations, as applicable.  
Study drug will be supplied as capsules in child-resistant blistercard dispensers; each blistercard contains enough study drug for [ADDRESS_158486], investigator, all study sit e personnel, and the sponsor (or designee) will be blinded to 
the subject’s treatment.  During this treatment period, all subjects will receive valbenazine or placebo as two capsules (identical in appearance) to be self -administered once daily. Clinical 
trial material supply chain  personnel who are not involved in decisions regarding subject’s study 
treatment will not be blinded.  
The randomization code will be broken for an individual subject only if the subject is pregnant, experiences an SAE that the investigator feels cannot be adequately treated without knowing the 

Neurocrine Biosciences, Inc., Study No. NBI -[ZIP_CODE]-HD3005 
Clinical Proto col Amendment No.  [ADDRESS_158487]’s treatment assignment, or for regulatory reporting requirements.  After  
the randomization code is broken because of a pregnancy, the subject will be informed of her 
treatment assignment.   In the case of a medical emergency in which knowledge of the identity of 
the study treatment is important for subject management, the investigator has the responsibility to decide whether to break the blind; treatment assignments would be unblinded using IWRS. It is recommended that the investigator contact [CONTACT_10542] (or designee; refer to Section  11.4.[ADDRESS_158488] information) before unblinding if it would not result in unnecessary 
delay to the immediate medical management of the subject. Documentation of the unblinding must be maintained.   
Members of the DSMB and individuals who generate the DSMB reports will be unblinded throughout the study. 
10.5. Study Drug Preparation and  Administration  
Study drug will be self- administered (in the presence of the subject’s caregiver, if applicable) 
once daily (qd) starting on Day 1.  Study drug should be administered at approximately the same time each day during the study.
  If a subject forgets or is unable to take the study drug during this 
time period, the subject should take his or her daily dose of study drug as soon as possible but no later than [ADDRESS_158489] or qualified personnel will be responsible for maintaining accurate records of the quantity and dates of all study drug supplies received, dispensed, and returned.   
10.7. Study Drug Retur n 
Written documentation to account for study drug and study drug materials is mandatory; all unused study drug and study drug materials must be kept in a secure location for final accountability and reconciliation.  Returned study drug and study drug material must be accounted for on a study drug return form provided by [CONTACT_139559].  The investigator must provide a written explanation for any destroyed or missing study drug or study drug materials on the study drug return form.

11.1. Definition  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product.  
AEs include, but are not limited to:  (1) a worsening or change in nature, severity, or frequency 
of conditions present at the start of the study; ( 2) intercurrent illness; and ( 3) drug interaction. 
Subject deterioration due to HD beyond what would otherwise be expected due to the natural history of the disease should be reported as an AE. 
If at any time after baseline the subject’s response to the suicidal ideation section of the C -SSRS 
is worse than the baseline assessment, it will be documented as an AE.  All suicidal behaviors 
will be documented as an AE.  
Subjects should be questioned in a general way, without asking about the occurrence of any specific symptom.  The investigator should attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, symptoms, and/or other clinical information.  In such cases, the diagnosis should be documented as the AE and not the individual signs/symptoms.  Following questioning and evaluation, all AEs, whether believed by [CONTACT_139560], must be documented in the subject’s medi cal records, in accordance with the investigator’s 
normal clinical practice and on the AE eCRF.  Each AE is to be evaluated for duration, intensity, frequency, seriousness, outcome, other actions taken, and relationship to the study drug.  
The following are not considered AEs:  
• Continuous persistent disease/symptom present before drug administration, unless it 
unexpectedly progresses, or increases in severity following drug administration.  
• Treatment failure or lack of efficacy.  
• Pregnancy.

Clinical Proto col Amendment No.  [ADDRESS_158491] be entered on the AE eCRF.  It should be noted that the term “severe” used to 
grade intensity is not synonymous with the term “serious.” 
Table 4: Intensity of Adverse Events 
Grade  Intensity  
Mild  An adverse event that is usually transient and may require only minimal treatment or 
therapeutic intervention.  The event does not generally interfere with usual activities 
of daily living.  
Moderate  An adverse event that is usually alleviated with additional specific therapeutic 
intervention.  The event interferes with usual activities of daily living, causing 
discomfort but poses no significant or permanent risk of harm to the research 
participant.  
Severe  An adverse event that interrupts usual activities of daily living, or significantly 
affects clinical status, or may require intensive therapeutic intervention.  
11.1.2. Relationship to Study Drug  
The investigator will document his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_139537] 5.   An AE  is deemed associated with the use of the 
study drug “if there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the AE” (otherwise referred to as a suspected adverse reaction).  Reasonable possibility means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationshi p between the drug and the AE (Title 21 CFR 312.32 [a]). 
Table 5: Relationship of Adverse Events to Study Drug 
Relationship  Description  
Definite  A reaction that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the drug or in 
which the drug level has been established in body fluids or tissue; that follows a known or 
expected response pattern to the suspected drug; and that is confirmed by [CONTACT_45452][INVESTIGATOR_11125], and reappearance of the reaction on repeated 
exposure.  
Possible  An adverse event in which there is reasonable possibility that the drug caused the event.  
Reasonable possibility means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the 
drug and the adverse event.  
Unlikely  A reaction that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the drug; that 
follows a known or suspected response pattern to the suspected drug; but that could 
reasonably be explained by [CONTACT_139561]’s clinical state.  
Not Related  Any event that does not meet the above criteria.  
11.2. Recording Adverse Events  
Each AE will be documented on the AE eCRF.  The investigator  (or designee) will provide 
information on dates of onset and resolution, intensity, seriousness, frequency, action(s) taken, 
changes in study drug usage, relationship to study drug, and outcome.

• Events of suicidal behavior or suicidal ideation type 4 (active suicidal ideation with some intent to act, without specific plan) or type 5 (active suicidal ideation with specific plan and intent) based on the C -SSRS.  
11.3. Poststudy Follow -Up of Adverse Events  
All AEs, including clinically significant ch anges in ECGs, physical examination findings, or 
isolated clinically significant laboratory findings must be followed until the event resolves, the condition stabilizes, the event is otherwise explained, or the subject is lost to follow -up. 
AEs ongoing at the final visit or at early termination will be followed for as long as necessary to 
adequately evaluate the subject’s safety or until the event stabilizes or resolves or until the subject is lost to follow -up.  The investigator is responsible for ensuring that follow -up includes 
any supplemental investigations as may be indicated to elucidate the nature and/or causality of the AE.  This may include additional laboratory tests or investigations, histopathological examinations, or consultation with other health care professionals, as is practical.  
11.4. Serious Adverse Events  
All SAEs will be recorded from the time the subject has signed the ICF until the final study visit.  Investigators are not obligated to actively seek SAEs after a subject has withdrawn from or  
completed the study.  However, if the investigator becomes aware of any SAE, including a death, at any time after a subject has been withdrawn from or has completed the study, and the investigator considers the event to be reasonably related to the study intervention or study participation, the investigator must promptly notify the sponsor as described in Section  11.4.3. 
11.4.1. Definition of a Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is any AE that results in any of the following outcome: 
• Death.  
• A life-threatening AE.  Life-threatening means that the subject was, in the view of the 
investigator or Sponsor, at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred.  It does 
not mean that hypothetically the event might have caused death if it occurred in a more serious form. 
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081].  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_139538] a pre-existing condition that did not worsen during the clinical investigation is not considered an AE.  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11127].  Complications that occur during

considered serious.  Treatment in a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11128] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
• A persistent or significant inc apacity or substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct 
normal life functions. 
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
• Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  These events may be consid ered serious when, based on appropriate medical 
judgment, they may jeopardize the health of the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed.  Any other event thought by [CONTACT_11177], following the reporting requirements detailed in this section.  Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias, convulsions that do not resul t in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug 
dependency or drug abuse. 
11.4.2. Managing Serious Adverse Events 
Subjects experiencing an SAE or an emergency situation will be examined by a physician as soon as possible.  The physician in attendance wi ll do whatever is medically needed for the 
safety and well-being of the subject.  The subject will remain under observation as long as medically indicated.  Appropriate laboratory studies will be conducted until all parameters return to normal or are otherwise explained or stable.  The subject will be followed until the SAE resolves or until the subject is medically stabilized.  The investigator (or designee) will notify  the 
Study Medical Monitor and NBI DSPV Department (and the IRB/IEC, if necessary) immediately (within 24 hours) of the SAE and the outcome of the SAE as described in Section  11.4.3. 
11.4.3. Reporting Serious Adverse Events and Other Immediately  Reportable Events  
SAEs and other immediately reportable events (defined in Section  11.2) must be reported within

system  for the duration of the study through a password-protected 
method of internet access.  Such access will be removed from study site s at the end of the site’s 
participation in the study.  Data from the EDC system will be archived on appropriate data media 
and provided to the site investigator at that time as a durable record of the site’s eCRF data.  Although not required, the site investigator may make paper printouts from that media.   All 
subject eCRF  data will also be provided to NBI via an agreed transfer method and in an agreed 
format. 
All clinical work conducted under this protocol is subject to GCP regulations.  This includes an 
inspection by [CONTACT_11148] (or designee) and/or health authority representatives at any time.  The site 
investigator will agree to the inspection of study -related records by [CONTACT_41790]/or NBI (or designee). 
12.2. Data Capture, Review, and Validation  
Data entered in the EDC system will be verified against the sour ce data by [CONTACT_11148] (or designee).  
After completion of the entry process, automated (computer-generated) logic checks will run in order to identify items such as inconsistent study dates.  In addition, manual review/checks may be performed.  NBI (or designee) may also request specific reports and/or listings in order to 
perform manual review of the data.  Any inconsistencies/errors/omissions identified will be sent to the study site  (via an electronic query) for the necessary corrections to be made to the eCRF.   
Any discrepancies will be corrected or explained online by [CONTACT_139562].  
Once entered and saved in an eCRF, data immediately become part of the study database and are available to NBI (or designee). 
12.3. Coding Dictionaries

13.1. Overview  
Descriptive and inferential statistical methods will be used to evaluate and summarize the data 
from this study. The term “descriptive statistics” refers to the number of subjects (n), mean, 
median, SD, SEM, minimum, an d maximum for continuous and ordinal categorical variables; 
and refers to the number and percentage of subjects for categorical variables.  Additional descriptive statistics may be presented for selected variables.  The term “inferential statistics” refers to hypothesis tests which will be performed to assess differences between the valbenazine treatment group and the placebo treatment group for selected efficacy variables.  
The analysis plan provided in this protocol represents a brief description of the pl anned analyses.  
The comprehensive statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be generated prior to final study database lock. 
13.2. Analysis Sets  
Two primary analysis sets will be defined for this study.  The safety analysis set will include all subjects who are randomized to a treatment group, take at least one dose of study drug, and have any postbaseline safety data.  The full analysis set (FAS) will include all subjects who are randomized to a treatment group and who have at least one evaluable TMC change from  baseline 
score during the 12-week double-blind treatment period.  Additional analysis set s may be 
specified in the SAP.  
13.3. Sample Size Determination  
A total sample size of 120 subjects (60 per group) will provide >95% power to detect a difference between the valbenazine and placebo treatment groups in the change from the screening period baseline (the average of the screening and Day -1 assessments) to maintenance (the average of the Week 10 and Week 12 assessments) in the TMC  based on on-site 
assessments , using a two -sample t-test with a two -sided Type I error of 0.05.  This assumes a 
difference in means of 2.[ADDRESS_158494] is attenuated to account for up to 4 (6.7%) subjects per treatment group who prematurely  
discontinue study drug dosing. 
The above sample size and power estimates were obtained from  . 
13.4. Handling of Missing Data  
Methods for handling missing data for the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints are discussed in Section  13.10.  Any additional methods or details for the handling of missing data 
will be described in the SAP.  
13.5. Disposition of Subjects  
The summary of subject enrollment and disposition will display the number of subjects who were randomized to each treatment group, who completed the dose-adjustment period (ie, up to Week 8), who competed the dose maintenance period (ie, up to Week 12), and who completed

A summary of the number and percentage of subjects with important protocol deviations ( IPDs) 
by [CONTACT_41795]. 
13.7. Demographics and Baseline Subject Characteristics  
Demographic data (age, sex , race, and ethnicity) and baseline characteristics (including , but not 
limited to:  height, weight, BMI,  genotype status, and baseline values for the TMC score) will be summarized with descriptive statistics.  Medical history will be summarized according to MedDRA System Organ Class (SOC) and Preferred Term (PT). 
13.8. Study Drug Dosing and Compliance  
The number and percentage of subjects who are dose compliant (at least 80% of expected number of doses taken) will be summarized with descriptive statistics by [CONTACT_765] (Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12). 
The number and percentage of subjects with dose adjustments will be summarized.  
13.9. Pharmacokinetics  
The plasma concentrations of valbenazine and the metabolite NBI -[ZIP_CODE] will be summarized 
with descriptive statistics by [CONTACT_765] (Day -1 and Weeks  2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14) and dose (last 
dose received prior to blood sample being drawn).  Concentrations below the lower limit of 
quantification will be set equal to zero for all plasma concentration summaries.  
13.10.  Efficacy Data  
The efficacy measures in this study include the UHDRS, PGI -C, CGI-C, PGI-S, CGI -S, SF-36, 
Neuro-QoL , EQ-5D-5L, HD-HI, .  Several 
derived variables based on these measures (eg, the SF -36 Physical Component Summary) will be 
summarized with descriptive statistics. Selected variables will include inferential statistics .  
Unless otherwise specified, the FAS will be used as the primary analysis set for all efficacy measures.  Regardless of adherence to study drug at the time of the assessment, all collected data will generally be included in the analyses.  The SAP will provide a full description of the derived variables and analyses that will be summarized for these efficacy measures.  
13.10.1. Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
The primary efficacy endpoint for this study is the change from the screening period baseline (the average of the screening and Day -1 assessments) to maintenance (the average of the

the screening period baseline to each postbaseline study visit (Weeks 2 through 12) are 
exploratory efficacy endpoints.  
Descriptive statistics will be presented by [CONTACT_139564] , and 
changes from the screening period baseline at each visit and at maintenance.  The changes from baseline to each postbaseline visit during the treatment period will be analyzed using a mixed -
effect model repeated measures (MMRM) analysis.  The model will include the screening period baseline TMC as a covariate, and treatment group, visit, treatment group -by-visit interaction, and 
baseline-by-vis it interaction as fixed effects.  Subject will be included as a random effect.  
Treatment group comparisons of the valbenazine treatment group vs. placebo at maintenance and each visit will be performed by [CONTACT_139565] (or equivalent programming code) 
for differences between treatment group least -squares (LS ) means.  The LS means and 
differences in LS means will be presented in summary tables, along with the associated 95% confidence intervals.  The treatment difference for the primary endpoint (maintenance) will be considered statistically significant if the two -sided  p value is <0.05.  Nominal (raw) two -sided 
p values for testing the significance of the treatment differences at the individual postbaseline visits will also be reported in the summary tables.  
Any additional supportive or sensitivity analyses of the TMC change from screening period baseline to maintenance will be described in the SAP.  
13.10.2. Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
CGI -C Responder Endpoint  
CGI-C response status at Week 12 will be a secondary efficacy endpoint.  Subjects whose CGI-C 
score is either a 1 ("very  much improved") or a 2 ("much improved") will be classified as 
responders. Response statuses  at Weeks [ADDRESS_158495] .  Missing data at 
Week  12 will be imputed using non-responder imputation.  Nominal two -sided p values for 
testing the significance of treatment group will be reported in summary tables; however, interpretation of the p value for the treatment group comparison at Week 12 will be based on a procedure which controls for multiple comparisons (Section 13.10.3). 
PGI-C Responder Endpoint  
PGI-C response status at Week 12 will be a secondary efficacy endpoint.  The definition of 
response and analyses will be identical to those described for the CGI -C responder endpoint.  
Neuro -QoL Upper Extremity Function  
The change from baseline (Day -1) to Week 12 in the Neuro-QoL Upper Extremity Function 
T-score will also be a secondary endpoint.  Change from baselin e to Week s 4, 8, and 10 are 
exploratory efficacy endpoint s.  
Descriptive statistics will be presented by [CONTACT_139566].  The changes from baseline to each postbaseline visit during the 
Neurocrine Biosciences, Inc., Study No. NBI -[ZIP_CODE]-HD3005 
Clinical Proto col Amendment No.  5 Final Version  
12 April 2021  Confidential  60 treatment period will be analyzed using MMRM.  The MMRM model will be similar to the 
model described above for the TMC analysis, with the exception that the covariate in the model will be the baseline value (Day -1) of the Neuro-QoL Upper Extremity Function T-score, and 
only visits where Neuro-QoL  is scheduled to be collected will be included.  Nominal two -sided p 
values for testing the significance of treatment group differences and associated 95% confidence intervals will be reported in summary tables; however , interpretation of the p value for the 
treatment group comparison at Week 12 will be based on a procedure which controls for multiple comparisons (Section 13.10.3). 
Neuro -QoL Lower Extremity Function 
The change from baseline (Day -1) to Week [ADDRESS_158496] of performing the hypothesis tests in the following prespecified order: 
1. Primary endpoint:  TMC change from screening period bas eline to maintenance 
(valbenazine versus placebo treatment group). 
2. Secondary endpoint:  CGI -C response at Week 12 (valbenazine versus placebo treatment 
group).  
3. Secondary endpoint:  PGI-C response at Week 12 (valbenazine versus placebo treatment group). 
4. Secondary endpoint:  Neuro-QoL Upper Extremity Function change from baseline to 
Week 12 (valbenazine versus placebo treatment group). 
5. Secondary endpoint:  Neuro-QoL Lower Extremity Function change from baseline to Week 12 (valbenazine versus placebo treatmen t group). 
Each step in the sequential testing procedure uses a local two -sided 0.05 level of significance for 
the null hypothesis being tested.  The null hypothesis at each step of the procedure can only be rejected if all null hypotheses in prior steps were rejected.  
13.10.4. Exploratory Endpoints 
Endpoints not described in the preceding paragraphs are considered exploratory endpoints.  Details regarding the definitions and analyses of these endpoints will be provided in the SAP.  
13.11.  Safety Data

Clinical Proto col Amendment No.  [ADDRESS_158501] ON THE 
CLINICAL STUDY  
Due to the global COVID-19 pandemic and in alignment with guidance put forth by [CONTACT_43747] (FDA ; Conduct of Clinical Trials of Medical Products During the 
COVID-19 Public Health Emergency  [March 2020, updated December 2020]) and Health 
Canada (Management of Clinical Trials During the COVID -19 Pandemic: Notice to Clinical 
Trial Sponsors [September 2020]), the following revisions have been made in  the event that a 
subject is unable to attend an in -person visit (eg, subject is unable to travel to the site for safety 
reasons or as part of public health measures ).  Remote visits are to  be conducted on a 
case-by-case basis at the judgement of the investigator and in consultation with the study medical monitor; once able, the subject is to return to in -person visits at the study site . 
Informed Consent  
In the situation where reconsent is necessary (eg, updated ICF, protocol amendments, etc.) and the subject is unable to print the informed consent document provided electronically by [CONTACT_139573], the investigator may consider 
using the following alternative process for obtaining and documenting informed consent.  This process is not applicable for initial ICF signing at  the screening visit which must be performed at 
the study site. 
1. The investigator provides the subject with an electronic version of the informed consent document. 
2. The investigator arranges a telephone call with the subject, the investigator, a witness who is not otherwise connected with the study and, if desired and feasible, additional participants requested by [CONTACT_423].  Alternatively, in lieu of having a witness present, the co nversation may be recorded. 
3. To ensure that all subjects are treated consistently , a standard process should be used that 
will accomplish the following:  
• Identification of who is on the call. 
• Review of the informed consent document with the investigator and responses to any 
questions the subject may have.  
• Verbal confirmation by [CONTACT_139574]. 
4. Verbal confirmation by [CONTACT_139575] a blank pi[INVESTIGATOR_139541] a written statement that they voluntarily agree to participate in the study, noting both the protocol number and brief protocol title. 
5. After signing and dating the newly created document, the subject sends a photograph of the signed  and dated statement by [CONTACT_6972], text message, or email to the investigator.  
The subject may also return the document to the investigator by [CONTACT_139576] a later date, or at a future study visit that may occur at the study site.

1. Remote visit  and dosing decision (approximately 1 day). 
a. Vitals, ECG, and urine and blood samples are collected.  
b. Patient -reported outcome ( PRO) assessments  (HADS, PGI -C, PGI-S, and 
Neuro-QoL)  are completed.  
c. Investigator and/or qualified designee conducts telephone call with subject and home 
health professional to conduct the investigator assessments per  Table  6. 
d. Home health professional reports vitals and ECG values to investigator via telephone 
call. 
e. Investigator reviews initial data obtained over telephone call  and makes dosing 
decision  based on tolerability . 
2. Shipment of study drug kit directly to subject (at least 1 full day). 
3. Subject receives study drug kit.  Investigator confirms dosing decision after full 
assessment of data obtained at remote visit.  
4. Subject begins dosing from the new study drug kit, as instructed by [CONTACT_093].

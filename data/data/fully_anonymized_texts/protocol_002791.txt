Study Protocol  
Objectives:  
- To prove that anterior approach total hip arthroplasty using the HANA table can be performed 
with little, if any, need for opi[INVESTIGATOR_281524] a combination of education, optimized pre op and post 
op pain protocols and optimized recovery protocols.  
- The secondary objective is to prove that nearly all  patients can be treated as outpatient joint 
replacements  
Design  
- Prospective, consecutive elective total hip cases excluding mentally ill and mentally challenged 
patients  
- All study patients will receive a standardized protocol  
- All surgical procedures prefo rmed by a single surgeon using the same implants, same approach, 
same pre op and post op optimization and same simplified pain protocol at a single hospi[INVESTIGATOR_395616]  
- Researchers will attempt to minimize the number of anesthesiologists to further control 
variability in care  
Research Team  
- Andrew Wickline, MD – Principal investigator, surgeon – will review data weekly to ensure 
quality data collection  
- Research associate Kim Strong PT, DPT

- Pre op narcotic use  
Secondary Outcomes  
- Pain scores  
- Sleep quality  
- Adherence to prescribed post op recovery protocol  
- Adverse events  
- Length of stay in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]  
- HOOS JR scores  
- Discharge location (home vs inpatient rehab facility)  
- Number of physical therapy visits

- SPPB score  
Analysis Plan  
- Primary Outcomes  
o Pre-op Narcotic Use  
▪ The number of patients that used opi[INVESTIGATOR_395619] -operatively will be reported. A 
simple percentage will be calculated by [CONTACT_395623] t otal 
number of patients in the study.  
o Opi[INVESTIGATOR_395620] 6 weeks  
▪ The number of patients that used any opi[INVESTIGATOR_395621] 6 week follow -up 
period will be reported. A simple percentage will be calculated by [CONTACT_395624] o f patients in the study.  
o Short Physical Performance Battery  at 6 weeks  
▪ The short physical performance battery (SPPB) assessment tool measures gait, 
balance and chair stand using a score measured on a scale  of [ADDRESS_497434] deviation will be reported  at the 6 week assessment.  
- Secondary Outcomes  
o Numeric Pain Scores  at 6 weeks   
▪ Patients were asked to assess their ‘best’ and ‘worst’ pain using a scale of [ADDRESS_497435] deviation will be reported at the 6 week assessment.  
o Sleep Quality at 6 weeks  
▪ Patients were aske d at the [ADDRESS_497436] -Operative Recovery Protocol  through 6 weeks  
▪ The number of patients that adhered to the prescribed post -operative recovery 
proto col will be reported. A simple percentage will be calculated by [CONTACT_395625].  
o Length of Stay in Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]  
▪ The number of days the patient stayed in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_395622]. The average of all patients as well as the minimum and maximum 
number of days will be reported. It is anticipated most patients will be 
discharged on the same day as the surgery.  
o Hip Dysfunction and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score for Joint Replacement (HOOS, Jr)  at 6 
weeks 
▪ HOOS Jr is an outcome assessment tool that combines pain, activities of daily 
living, and stiffness into a score on a [ADDRESS_497437] 
deviation of the total score will be reported at the 6 week assessment.  
o Return to Work 6 Weeks after Surgery  
▪ The number of patients that returned to work will be recorded for each patient 
at the 6 week assessment. A simple percent age will be calculated by [CONTACT_395626].  
o Return to Driving 6 Weeks after Surgery  
▪ The number of patients that returned to driving will be recorded for each 
patient at the 6 week assessment. A simple percen tage will be calculated by 
[CONTACT_395627].

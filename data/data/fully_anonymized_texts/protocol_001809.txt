Page 3 of 13 1.0 SPECIFIC STUDY AIMS Aims The overall objective of the study is to improve health-related quality of life and the cancer care experience for health care beneficiaries of Unite Here Health (UHH) in Atlantic City, NJ and Chicago, IL after they receive a new diagnosis of cancer or a relapsed or progressive advanced stage of cancer. The study aims primarily to determine if the intervention improves a patient’s health-related quality of life. Secondarily, the study aims to include the effect on the change in patient satisfaction with decision-making and patient activation, change in health care use and advance directive and goals of care documentation as well as end of life outcomes including health care use and total costs of care.  The intervention consists of trained, culturally sensitive community health workers (CHWs) who assist patients and families in identifying and intervening on complications from social determinants of health, understanding and discussing their care goals, engage in proactive symptom assessment, and participate in care delivery closer to and in patients’ homes and communities.  Hypothesis Compared to patients who receive usual oncology care, patients who partner with CHWs are hypothesized to experience improved health-related quality of life. Secondary outcomes are meant to be exploratory however we expect effects on these outcomes in favor of the intervention.     
Page [ADDRESS_33090]-enrollment (for patients with newly diagnosed, relapsed or progressive disease). The key elements of the intervention address three major challenges faced by [CONTACT_33730]: 1) patients and their families who face social and economic challenges experience challenges in communication with their providers regarding their goals of care and understanding their prognosis; 2) patients experience difficulty in expressing their symptoms to their providers; and 3) patients experience challenges attending their clinic and treatment appointments due to financial burden, travel difficulties and/or lack of social support to drive and accompany them to their visits. (See Appendix for Rationale) The proposed intervention addresses these three critical care elements by [CONTACT_33731]-sensitive, community-based health care workers who assist patients and families in identifying complications from social determinants of health such as transportation, financial or housing, discussing goals of care and advance care planning, proactively assess cancer-related symptoms with oversight from a UHH nurse, and assist in coordinating care delivery at home through leveraging telephonic discussions and home visits. 3.0 STUDY ENROLLMENT AND PARTICIPANT ELIGIBILITY   3.1 Study Enrollment Location Health beneficiaries of UHH newly diagnosed cancer or relapsed or recurrent cancer may be referred by [CONTACT_33732].  Enrollment Procedures UHH Staff assigned to the program will target potential patients on an ongoing basis using their claims data system. This includes data from a variety of sources including but not limited to Daily Inpatient Reports; referrals from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_33717], PCPs and Specialists; referrals from other UHH staff such as those working in customer service; and referrals from Union staff and participants. The study staff will review all potential patients with newly diagnosed or recurrent disease no matter the stage or type to determine eligibility for the program. After the site PI [INVESTIGATOR_33718] [ADDRESS_33091] proper screening (see below section titled “Screening Procedures” for specific details), the program will be explained to patients and patients will then be enrolled in the study. Screening Procedures The Site PI [INVESTIGATOR_33719] 3.2. Screen failures will not be included in the study data. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_11247] a record of history and reasons for screen failures; however, any patient information gathered during this process will be destroyed. Consent Procedures  The study staff will discuss the intervention with the patient, at the first point of contact, after eligibility has been confirmed. The study staff will introduce the program and describe the program aims and objectives. Patients will be provided adequate time to make an informed decision regarding their participation. Patients who refuse participation or have no capacity for decision-making or consent will not be included in the study. If a patient is interested and consents verbally, he/she will be provided a welcome letter with basic information and contact [CONTACT_33733]. The patients will be randomized by [CONTACT_33734] a computer-generated ordered list of randomized numbers in each city. For all patients assigned to the LEAPS intervention arm, the community health worker will contact [CONTACT_33735], documenting goals of care, proactively assessing symptoms, and coordinating home-based or community-based care delivery. The intervention will be provided in addition to the usual care processes (Intervention details are provided in Appendix B).  3.2 Participant Criteria Inclusion criteria 1. Newly diagnosed patients with a cancer diagnosis.  2. Patients with any relapse or progressive disease (any cancer diagnosis) as identified by [CONTACT_33736].  3. The patients must be [ADDRESS_33092] the ability to verbally consent and understand study procedures. Exclusion Criteria 1. Inability to consent to the study.  2. Patients without a newly diagnosed malignancy or patients without relapse of disease.  3. Patients not eligible for fund benefits.  
Page 6 of 13  Criteria for Removal from Study Any patients or families of patients in the intervention arm who withdraw consent will be removed from the study. Upon removal, usual care will be restored for these patients.  3.3 Enrollment The target number of subjects at the site is 160 (80 per arm). Patient enrollment will continue until sample size is reached (anticipated 24 months). Data collection will occur at baseline and months 4 and months 12 for each patient in the study. The data follow-up period (to assess utilization will occur for up to 12 months following each patient enrollment or death (whichever is first)).   4.[ADDRESS_33093] database (CarMa) and assigned an identification number. The identification number will be used on all subject-specific documents and research-related forms. During registration, patients will be randomized to two arms (Arm A: Usual Care or Arm B: LEAPS Intervention). Specifically, the patients will be randomized 1:1 using a simple randomization strategy in each site into two arms at each site. All patients, throughout the study, will be asked to complete three surveys: 1) patient health-related quality of life (using Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy – General (FACT-G) and 2) satisfaction with decision-making (Satisfaction with Decision Scale) and 3) the patient activation measure (Patient Activation Measure-13). A trained study staff member will administer the surveys at baseline (month 0) and again at [ADDRESS_33094] date of the following: goals of care documented by [CONTACT_33737], advance directive, and Physician Order for Life Sustaining Treatment. All health care claims data will be provided by [CONTACT_33738], inpatient and pharmacy services.  All study team members will be blinded to the randomization assignment. Only the community health workers will know the study assignment and the local site coordinator at each site.  As part of usual care, study PI [INVESTIGATOR_33720] 7 of 13 provider in Atlantic City. We will also provide each member with access to transportation and other services to receive care at the preferred provider.  • Arm A: Usual Care (Control) / No Intervention Patients in this arm receive “usual” care coordination from their care coordination team which includes case management by a registered nurse practitioner to address financial concerns, care navigation and coordination.  • Arm B: LEAPS/ Intervention Group The intervention will be comprised of a CHW assignment with a baseline introduction (either telephonic or in-person) of the program followed by a visit (telephonic or in-person) with the community health worker to screen for health-related social needs, identify and refer to community resources for any identified complication from social determinants of health and to begin intervention regarding goals of care and symptom management. All CHWs have undergone standardized training with additional supervised visits to gain skills in engaging patients and families in goals discussion and in symptom assessment algorithms (see Appendix for Details).  The CHW will contact [CONTACT_33739]’ ongoing needs but will provide at a minimum weekly support from time to enrollment up to [ADDRESS_33095] meetings with patient’s family and caregivers at the same time intervals where possible. The intervention details are provided in the Appendix.    Lay Health Worker Training The PI [INVESTIGATOR_33721] (See Appendix for a list of topi[INVESTIGATOR_33722]), biweekly case rounds, shadowing and role plays.   All CHWs will also be provided with previously tested and developed standardized training manuals that are refined based on feedback from stakeholders at UHH. The manuals include a highly detailed workflow of the project, from enrollment to completion. CHWs also will receive training on what to say during patient contact, advanced care planning conversations, documentation of advance care planning, the study calendar, data management, and key contact [CONTACT_3031]. CHWs will also receive training on symptom management. Supervision of the Lay Health Worker  The community health worker will be supervised by [CONTACT_33740]. The RN will ensure that the protocol is carried out correctly and address any issues that may arise in the LHWs’ workflow. The CHWs at each site (2 0.4 FTE in Chicago, 3 0.3 FTE in Atlantic City) will participate in monthly meetings with the rest of the project members (at both Stanford and UHH) to review study accrual and program goals.

Secondary Outcome Measure Patient satisfaction and activation will be explored using changes in the Patient Satisfaction with Decision Scale and Patient Activation Measure. Utilization will be measured evaluating comparisons of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], emergency department, and referrals to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_33728]. Advanced care planning will be measured by [CONTACT_33741], Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment, and goals of care documentation in patients’ electronic health record charts. Patient survival will also be compared between groups. Total costs of care will be abstracted from UHH database only to conduct a budget impact analysis and obtain point estimates for refinement of the intervention in anticipation of a larger multi-center trial. A cost-effectiveness analysis is not planned and will not occur until effectiveness has been demonstrated in subsequent studies upon completion of this study.   5.2 Analysis Plan The Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be prepared prior to the commencement of data analysis. All patients enrolled in the study will be used for the analysis for an intention to treat analysis.  Secondary analyses are for exploratory outcomes only and include differences in satisfaction with decision-making, acute care utilizations and to obtain point estimates on costs of care. Statistical significance of secondary outcomes is for trends only and not represented in this sample size calculation.   5.3 Sample Size The primary goal is to improve quality of life. A total of 160 patients are needed to attain significant between-group differences from baseline to 4 months after study enrollment for patients.

Page 11 of 13 Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP)  Title: Lay Health Workers Engage, Educate, and Encourage Patients to Share (LEAPS)  1.1. Study Aims  1.1.1. Aim 1 The primary aim of the LEAPS program is to evaluate whether trained lay health workers who engage newly diagnosed patients with cancer and patients with newly diagnosed relapsed or progressive disease can improve Health-Related Quality of Life (HrQOL) at [ADDRESS_33100] 30 days of life among those who died.    2.4. Randomization 1:1 Randomization of participants using simple randomization strategy by [CONTACT_3725]; allocation to either the 12-month intervention combined with usual oncology  care or usual oncology care alone in Atlantic City, NJ and Chicago, IL.  2.[ADDRESS_33101] 3.1. Primary Outcome(s) Health-related Quality of Life (HRQoL) (change in scores from baseline to [ADDRESS_33102]-enrollment). Health-related quality of life assessed using the 27-item Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy – General where scores range from 0-108 with higher scores indicating better health-related quality of life.  3.2 Secondary Outcome(s) – Exploratory Outcomes Only   Health Related Quality of Life is measured by [CONTACT_33743]-General: a 27-item questionnaire designed to measure four domains of HRQOL in patients with cancer. The scale is on a 5-point Likert-type scale with a score range of 0-108 with higher scores indicating greater HRQoL.   Patient Satisfaction with Decision is measured by [CONTACT_33744], a six-item scale designed to measure patient satisfaction with healthcare decision. Each item is on a 1-5 scale with higher scores indicating greater satisfaction with decision.   Patient activation is measured by [CONTACT_33745]. Each item rated on 4-point scale (1 strongly disagree to 4 strongly agree, with additional “not applicable” option. Total PAM score = [raw score]/[# items answered excepting non-applicable items] *13 ; can be transformed to a scale with a theoretical range 0–100 based on calibration tables. Raw scores can be converted into activation levels which can also be used as cut-offs:  4. Statistical Analysis Plan  We will present descriptive statistics broken out by [CONTACT_33746] (mean, standard deviation, median, interquartile range), and discrete (counts, percentages) where appropriate. We will also tabulate and present for each relevant covariate the percentage of subjects missing a value for that covariate, if applicable.  4.2. Primary Analysis 
Page [ADDRESS_33103]-enrollment between groups, we will calculate expected mean differences between groups by [CONTACT_33747] (GEE) models where the outcome will be modeled as a function of treatment group, categorical time (baseline, 4 months, 12 months) and an interaction term between treatment group and time with an exchangeable correlation clustered within person. Significance will be assessed between groups overtime using a type III F-test on the interaction term. All ratios will be expressed as referent to the control group.  [IP_ADDRESS]. Site-specific Modeling  We will consider refitting primary models for each site separately to explore the effect of site heterogeneity on our results.  Sample Size Considerations  The sample size of 160 participants (80 randomized to the intervention group and 80 randomized to the control group) provides greater than 90% power to detect difference in quality of life between groups (delta change =4) assuming a within-subject correlation of 0.[ADDRESS_33104] deviation of the change in score equal to 9.5 based on our pi[INVESTIGATOR_10299]. The primary outcome was determined by [CONTACT_33748].

3.3 Benefit /Risk/Assessment
Abatacept i s a fully human fusi on protein representing a new class of therapeuti c agent known as 
a select ive costimulat ion modulator wi th potenti al for immunom odulator y activity. This expected 
activit y should be taken into consideration in caring for human participants participating in clinical 
trials with abatacept. Invest igators should be alert to signs of infection in participants, and 
participants shoul d be cauti oned to report any  signs of infect ion, such as fever, sore throat, cough 
or unusual appearances of skin lesions (swelling, warmth, tenderness, or exudate) to their 
physician without delay. The risks of infecti on occurring in the currently proposed single dose
study , however, are expected to be very  low.

This study  is in healthy participants, a populat ion that would not receive any health benefi t from 
participat ing in this study . Although thi s single dose study  for norm al heal thy partici pants shoul d 
not pose an unacceptable health risk to participants based on the established safet y profile of 
abatacept, in order to minimize the overall risk to participants, this protocol  has inclusio n and 
exclusio n criteria appropri ate to the population and proposed dosing, ex clusionary  screening tests 
(tuberculosis testing, chest x-ray, medical history , physical  examination), and specific follow-up 
safet y assessments. Adverse events and SAEs will be reviewed on an ongoi ng basis by [CONTACT_648675] y

Risks from the PK, immunogenicit y, and clinical  safety phlebotomy  procedures are standard and 
include infection, bleeding, bruising, blood clot form ation, disco mfort at the inject ion site, and
(rarely) faint ing.

Objectives Endpoints
Primary
To compare the PK of the abatacept drug product converted from drug 
substance by a new drug substance process (Treatment A) relative to the 
current drug substance process (Treatment B) following a single dose ( 750 
mg)IV infusion in healthy participants.Cmax and AUC(INF) of abatacept
Secondary
To assess the safety of a single dose ( 750-mg )IV infusion of the abatacept 
drug product converted from drug substance by a new drug substance 
process (Treatment A) versus drug substance by [CONTACT_648676] (Treatment B).Safety assessments will be based on 
medical review of AErepor ts, vital 
sign measurements, ECGs, physical 
examinations, and clinical 
laborato ry tests.
To assess the immunogenicity of abatacept drug product converted from 
drug substance by a new drug substance process (Treatment A) versus 
drug substance by [CONTACT_648677] t drug substance process (Treatment B).Immunogenicity determination will 
be based on the incidence of 
laborato ry-reported positive 
responses and titers of anti -
abatacept antibodies specific for 
“CTLA4 and possibly Ig” and “Ig 
and/o r Junction Region.”
To characterize the PK of abatacept drug product converted from drug 
substance by a new drug substance process (Treatment A) versus drug 
substance by [CONTACT_648678] (Treatment B).Tmax, AUC(0 -T), AUC(0 -28 day),

5 STUDY DESIGN
5.1 Overall Design
This is an open -label, rando mized, parallel group , single- dose study  in healt hy participants 
following IV administration of abatacept. 
Parti cipants will undergo screening evaluat ions to determine eligibilit y within 28 days prior to 
drug administration on Day 1. All partici pants are required to weigh between 60 and 100 kg, 
inclusive, and should be weighed using the same scale at each site. 
Parti cipants will be admi tted to the clinical facilit y the day prior to dosing (Day -1) and will be 
confined unt il at least [ADDRESS_869224]- dose. 
On Day 1, eligible participants will be rando mized in a 1:1 ratio. The randomizat ion will be 
stratified by [CONTACT_648679]: 60 to < 70 kg, 70to< 80 kg,80 to < 90 kg, and 
90to≤ [ADDRESS_869225] converted from drug substance by a new drug substance process (Treatm ent A) or 
abatacept drug product converted from drug substance by [CONTACT_648678]
(Treatm ent B) in a 1:1 rati o. A minimum of 1 0participants per treatm ent per weight categ ory are 
planned to be rando mized .
In order to decrease variabilit y, the goal of the treatm ent group assignment is to match each 
participant 1:1by [CONTACT_648680] a participant with the opposi te treatm ent assignment. 
Randomization numbers will be sequent ial within each weight category, starting wit h 1001, 2001, 
3001, and 4001 for 60 to < 70 kg, 70to< 80 kg, 80 to < 90 kg, and 90 to ≤ 100 kg weight 
categor ies, respectively.
On Day  1, parti cipants will receive a single IV infusion of either Treatment A or Treatment B at a 
dose of 750 mg over approximately 30 minutes using a calibrated, constant -rate infusio n pum p.
The study  design schemat ic is presented in Figure 5.1 -1.

APPENDIX 3 ADVERSE EVENTS AND S ERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT S: 
DEFINITIONS AND PROC EDURES FOR RECORDING , 
EVALUATING, FOLLOW U P AND REPORTING
ADVERSE EVENTS
Adverse Event Definition:
An Adverse Event (AE) i s defi ned as any  new untoward m edical  occurrence or worsening of a 
preexist ing medical condit ion in a c linical invest igation partici pant administered study  treatm ent
and that does not necessarily  have a causal  relati onship wi th this treatm ent. 
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (such as an abnorm al laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use o f study treatment, whether or 
not consi dered rel ated to the study  treatment.
Events Meeting the AE Definition
Any abnorm al laboratory  test results (hematol ogy, clinical chemistry , or urinalysis) or 
resul ts from other safet y assessments (eg, ECG, radio logical scans, vital signs 
measurements), including those that worsen from baseline, considered clinically signi ficant 
in the medical and scientific judgment of the investigator. Note that abnormal lab tests or 
other safet y assessments shoul d only be reported as AEs if the final diagnosis is not 
available. Once the final diagnosis is known, the reported term  shouldbe updated to be the 
diagnosis .
Exacerbat ion of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condit ion including eit her an increase 
in frequency and/or intensit y of the condit ion.
New condit ions detected or diagnosed after study intervent ion administration even though it 
may have been present before the start of the study.
Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug -drug interaction.
Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study  intervent ion 
or a conco mitant medicat ion. Overdose, as a verbatim term (as reported by [CONTACT_3170]), 
shoul d not be reported as an AE/SAE unless it is an intent ional overdose taken with possible 
suicidal/self-harming intent. Such overdoses should be reported regardl ess of sequelae and 
shoul d specify "intent ional overdose" as the verbatim term
Events NOT Meeting the AE Definition
Medical or surgical procedure (eg, endoscopy , appendectomy): the condi tion that leads to 
the procedure is the AE.
Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or 
convenience admissio n to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]).
DEFINITION OF SAE
If an event i s not an AE per definit ion above, then it cannot be an SAE even if serious condi tions 
are met.

SERIOUS ADVERSE EVEN TS
Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any 
dose:
Results in death
Is life-threatening (defined as an event in which the participant was at ri sk of  death at the time 
of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically mi ght have caused death if it were 
more severe)
Requi res inpat ient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_53912] (see NOTE 
below)
NOTE: 
The fo llowing hospi [INVESTIGATOR_53913]: 
a visit to the emergency  room or other hospi [INVESTIGATOR_53914] < 24 hours, that does not resul t 
in admissio n (unless considered an important medical or life -threatening event)
elective surgery, planned prior to signing consent
admissio ns as per protocol for a planned medical/su rgical procedure
routi ne health assessment requiring admissi on for baseline/trending of health status (e.g., 
routi ne col onoscopy )
medical/surgical admissio n other than to remedy ill healt h and planned prior to entry into 
the study . Appropri ate docum entati on is requi red in these cases
admissio n encountered for another life circumstance that carries no bearing on healt h status 
and requi res no medical/surgical interventi on (e.g., lack of housing, economic inadequacy, 
caregiver respi[INVESTIGATOR_040], family circu mstances, administrative reason)
admissio n for administration of anticancer therapy in the absence of any other SAEs (applies 
to oncology  protocol s)
Results in persistent or significant disabilit y/incapacit y
Is a congenital ano maly/birth defect
Is an important m edical event (defined as a medical event(s) that m ay not be immediately life-
threatening or resul t in death or hospi [INVESTIGATOR_3092], based upon appropriate medical and 
scientific judgment, may jeopardi ze the participant or may require intervent ion [e.g., medical, 
surgi cal] to prevent one of the other seri ous outcomes listed in the definit ion above.) Examples 
of such events include, but are not limited to, intensive treatm ent in an emergency  room or at 
home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsio ns that do not resul t in 
hospi [INVESTIGATOR_28689].) Potenti al drug induced liver injury  (DILI) is also considered an important 
medical event. (See Section 9.2.7 for the definit ion of potenti al DILI.) 
Pregnancy and potenti al drug induced liver injury (DILI) must follow the same transmissio n timing 
and processes to BMS as used for SAEs (see section 9.2.5 for reporting pregnancies).

Any co mponent of a study  endpoint that i s considered related to study  therapy  should be reported 
as SAE (e.g., death is anendpo int, if death occurred due to anaphylaxis, anaphylaxis must be 
reported).
EVALUATING AES AND S AES
Assessment of Causality
The invest igator i s obligated to assess the rel ationship between study  intervent ion and each 
occurrence of each AE/SAE.
A “reas onable possibilit y” of a relationship conveys that there are facts, evidence, and/or 
argum ents to suggest a causal relationship, rather than a relat ionship cannot be rul ed out.
The invest igator will use clinical judgment to determine the relat ionship.
Alternative causes, such as underlying disease(s), concomitant therapy , and other risk 
factors, as well as the temporal relat ionship of the event to study intervent ion administratio n 
will be considered and invest igated.
The invest igator will also consult the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) and/or Product 
Inform ation, for marketed products, in his/her assessment.
For each AE/SAE, the invest igator mustdocument in the medical notes that he/she has 
reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causalit y.
There may be situations in which an SAE has occurred and the invest igator has minima l 
inform ation to include in the init ial report to Sponsor. However, it is very  important that the 
investigator always make an assessment of causalit y for every event before the initial 
transmissio n of the SAE data to Sponsor.
The invest igator may change his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_3078] n of causalit y in light of follow-up informat ion 
and send a SAE fo llow-up report wi th the updated causalit y assessment.
The causalit y assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regul atory  reporting 
requi rements.
Follow -up of AEs and SAEs
If only limited informat ion is initially available, follow-up reports are requi red. (Note: Foll ow-
up SAE reports must include the same invest igator term(s) init ially reported.) 
If an ongoing SAE changes in its intensit y or relationship to study  treatm entor if new 
inform ation beco mes available, the SAE report must be updated and submitted within 24 hours 
to BMS (or designee) using the same procedure used for transmitt ing the init ial SAE report.
All SAEs must be fo llowed to resol ution or stabilization.

APPENDIX 4 WOMEN OF CHILDBEARIN G POTENTIAL DEFINITI ONS AND 
METHODS OF CONTRACEP TION
DEFINITIONS
Woman of Childbearing Potential (WOCBP)
A woman is considered fertile following menarche and until becoming post-menopausal unless 
perm anent ly sterile. Perm anent sterilizat ion methods include hysterectomy, bilateral 
salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656] , and bilateral  oophorectomy.
Women in the following categories are not considered WOCBP
Prem enarchal
Prem enopausal  female wi th 1 of the f ollowing:
Docum ented hysterectomy
Docum ented bilateral  salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656]
Docum ented bilateral  oophorectomy
Note: Docum entati on can come from the site personnel’s review of the partici pant’s medica l 
records, med ical examinat ion, or m edical history  interview.
Postmenopausal  female
A postm enopausal  state is defined as [ADDRESS_869272] a serum  follicle stimulat ing horm one, (FSH) level 
> 40 mIU/mL to confirm menopause.
Note: Females treated with horm one replacement therapy, (HRT) are likely to have artificially 
suppressed FSH levels and may require a washout period in order to obtain a physi ologic FSH 
level. The durati on of the washout period is a function of the type of HRT used. The durati on of 
the washout period below are suggested guidelines and the invest igators should use their 
judgement in checking serum FSH le vels. 
1 week minimum for vaginal hormonal products (rings, creams, gels)
4 week minimum for transdermal products
8 week minimum for oral products
Other parenteral products may requi re washout periods as long as 6 months. If the serum  FSH 
level is > 40 mIU/ml at any time during the washout period, the wom an can be considered 
postm enopausal.

If not, an additional highly effective method of contraception should be u sed. 
Sexual abstinence
Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from 
heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study treatment. 
The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the 
study and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant.
It is not necessary to use any other method of contraception when complete abstinence is 
elected. 
WOCBP participants who choose complete abstinence must continue to have pregnancy 
tests, as specified in Section 2. 
Acceptable alternate methods of highly effective contraception must be discussed in the 
event that the WOCBP participants chooses to forego complete abst inence

APPENDIX 5 DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA FOR DRUG AND ALCOHOL ABUSE
The fo llowing i s taken from  DSM -IV:
Diagnostic Cri teria for Psychoactive S ubstance Dependence
A maladapt ive pattern of substance use, leading to clinically significant impairment or distress as 
manifested by  3 (or m ore) of the fo llowing, occurring at any  time in the same 12 -month peri od:
1.Tolerance, as defined by [CONTACT_648695]:
a)A need for markedly increased amounts of the substance to achieve intoxicat ion or desired 
effect,
b)Markedly diminished effect with continued use o f the sam e am ount of  the substance.
2.Withdrawal, as manifested by [CONTACT_387603]:
a)The characte ristic withdrawal syndro me for the substance,
b)The same (or closely related) substance is taken to relieve or avoid wit hdrawal symptoms.
3.The substance is o ften taken in larger amounts or over a longer period than was intended.
4.There i s a persistent desire o r unsuccessful efforts to cut down or control substance use.
5.A great deal of time is spent in activit ies necessary to obtain the substance (eg,visiting mult iple 
doctors or driving long distances), use the substance (eg,chain -smoking) or recover from its 
effects.
6.Important social, occupati onal or recreational activities are given up or reduced because of 
substance use.
7.The substance use is cont inued despi[INVESTIGATOR_147607] a persistent or recurring physical 
or psychological problem  that is likely  to have been caused or exacerbated by [CONTACT_232823] 
(eg, current cocaine use despi[INVESTIGATOR_387585] -induced depressio n, or continued 
drinking despi[INVESTIGATOR_387586] l consumpt ion.)
Criteria for Severi ty of Psychoact ive Substance Dependence:
Mild:  Few, if any, symptoms in excess of those required to make the diagnosis, and the symptoms 
resul t in no m ore than mild impairment in occupational functioning or in usual social act ivities or

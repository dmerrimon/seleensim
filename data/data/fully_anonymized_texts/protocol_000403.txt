31.0 Objectives  
1.1Aim 1: Modify care.coach, an existing inpatient bedside digital relational 
agent to enhance the well-being, safety, and outcomes of patients 
undergoing hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). We will convene a 
focus group consisting of HCT nurse navigators, inpatient HCT nurses, and 
HCT physicians and extenders to determine appropriate modifications to the 
care.coach health coaching protocols and technology setup for the inpatient 
HCT setting, including development of educational modules that will be 
provided to patients undergoing HCT. 
1.2Aim 2: Iteratively pi[INVESTIGATOR_669309]. We will assess the feasibility of the patient education and 
relational functions of the digital avatar.  
2.0  Background
2.1 Among patients who undergo reduced intensity conditioning stem cell       
transplantation (RIC), relatively lengthy inpatient stays are routine for pre-
HCT conditioning and receipt of donor cells. As those who receive this type 
of transplant tend to be older (60 to 75) and/or have baseline comorbidities, 
the inpatient stay can be difficult. Indeed, in-house delirium is one of the most 
frequent and distressing complications, even though it is typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] a treatable, 
reversible syndrome.   
The incidence of delirium in cancer patients undergoing myeloablative HCT is 
about 50%, and the presence of delirium at any point during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_669310] (odds 
ratio = 14).[ADDRESS_904026] patients, research has shown 
that loneliness during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_669311], reducing both social and functional 
well-being, increasing difficulty of managing disease symptoms six months 
after transplant, and increasing ratio of neutrophil to monocyte counts 30 days 
after transplant (an indicator of poorer survival rate).[ADDRESS_904027] been implemented to 
improve the quality of life (QOL) of pediatric and adult HCT patients include 
psychoeducational, exercise, and mindfulness interventions, all of which hold 
PROTOCOL TITLE: Development and Pi[INVESTIGATOR_669307]-based Intervention to Support 
Patients Undergoing Stem Cell Transplantation 
4potential to outcomes during patients’ hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]. In a multimodal study, 
individualized psychoeducation was provided to HCT patients 5 days a week 
alongside other interventions; patients showed an improvement for a variety 
of symptoms.5-[ADDRESS_904028] settings.6,7 Mindfulness mediation (MM) 
practices can be easily provided to patients and have the potential to relieve 
patient distress.[ADDRESS_904029] changes in lifestyle are complex, 
including nutrition, hydration, transplant medications, home disinfection, 
socialization, and others. For this population, the Health Belief Model5,  and 
Prochaska’s Transtheoretical model of change6 would argue that patients who 
are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_669312] “groundwork for change/take action” 
phase while admitted.  
care.coach™ provides a care support and health coaching platform in which a 
patient-facing interface is a digital relational agent, appearing on a tablet 
device as a dog or cat avatar to enable a non-judgmental, positive emotional 
connection for inpatients during their stay. Each avatar is controlled directly 
by a 24x7, world-wide team of trained humans known as “health advocates,” 
who are background checked, psychometrically screened, and receive 
specialized training (non-medical). Each health advocate can cost-effectively 
monitor and engage 12 or more patients sequentially (2 simultaneously) 
through audio/visual feeds from the patient’s device and send text commands 
which are converted into the avatar’s voice through a speech synthesis engine. 
The health advocates are guided by a software-driven expert system 
embedded into their work interface, which implements evidence-based 
clinical protocols to support patient self-management and care coordination. 
Pace University conducted a clinical pi[INVESTIGATOR_669313].coach technology in 
2016 at Jamaica Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_669314] 95 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057]

5engagement using 11.5 images or audio files, and 6.5 protocol-driven tasks 
per patient, per day, based on certain protocols derived from the Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_669316] (HELP).9 Compared to randomized control patients with a 
daily nurse student visit (n=54), intervention patients with our bedside avatar 
(n=41) showed a significantly greater reduction in delirium score (CAM, 
p=0.003) and loneliness (UCLA-LS, p=0.008). The primary intervention unit 
had 0.9 falls per 1000-patient days during the 3-month study period, compared 
to 6.5 on the control unit (86% reduction in fall rate).[ADDRESS_904030] home

The following steps can be used for either a PI[INVESTIGATOR_669319] a Hickman 
Central Line. 
oMUST wash hands prior, may choose not to wear gloves  
Steps to flushing catheter, which are as follows: 
1. Clean your worktable with a disinfectant wipe 
2. Gather supplies 
a. Catheter caps 
b. Alcohol wipes 
c. Prefilled 10mL .9% saline flush 
d. Gloves (optional) 
e. Alcohol cover (Curos) 
3. Wash hands well with soap and water OR use an alcohol-based 
hand sanitizer 
4. Dry your hand with a clean paper towel  
5. If you have been taught to or want to use gloves, put them on now 
6. Take the flush syringe from the package 
7. Hold the syringe up in the air with the plunger pointing to the 
floor 
8. Tape the syringe so that any air bubbles rise to the top 
9. Take off the syringe cap 
10. Push the plunger to the 10mL mark. This will take out any air and 
extra flush from the syringe. Some flush may drop out. 
11. Hold the syringe upright and do not let the syringe touch anything   
12. Do you have a green alcohol cover over your catheter cap OR do 
you NOT have a green alcohol cover over your catheter cap 
a. IF YES: 
i. Remove the green alcohol cover only, do not reuse 
ii. Leave the catheter cap in place 
iii. Do not let the end of the catheter cap touch 
anything, including your body  
b. IF NO 
i. Open the alcohol wipe 
ii. Scrub the catheter cap with the alcohol wipe for at 
least 10 seconds 
PROTOCOL TITLE: Development and Pi[INVESTIGATOR_669307]-based Intervention to Support 
Patients Undergoing Stem Cell Transplantation 
9iii. Let it dry completely 
iv. Do not let the end of the catheter cap touch 
anything, including your body after it has been 
cleaned   
13. Hold the catheter cap 
14. Put in and screw the flush syringe onto the end of the catheter cap 
15. Open the clamp on the catheter 
16. Flush the line with the saline using a push pause method. The 
turbulence helps to keep your line clear. 
17. Firmly push 1cc then pause 
18. Continue to push 1cc and pause until the line is flushed with al [ADDRESS_904031] to push, STOP. Do not push the flush. 
Close the clamp. Unscrew and remove the syringe. Call 
your doctor or Oncology Nurse Navigator.  
19. Do not use force to flush  
20. Be sure that the clamp is over wording “ clamp here” 
21. Clos ethe clamp on the catheter. You should here a click. 
22. Hold the catheter cap tightly and unscrew the syringe form the 
catheter. Be careful not to loosen the catheter cap form the 
catheter. 
23. Always check to be sure the catheter cap is on tight 
24. Put a new green alcohol cover over the catheter cap. 
25. Now flush all other lumens of the catheter. 
26. After you flush all of your lumens, throw your supplies away.

Aim 2: Single-arm feasibility pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], with 3 cohorts of 6 patients (18 total). 
8.2 care.coach  
care.coach is a “human-in the-loop” conversational agent (avatar) used to interact 
and converse with patients through natural dialogue and text-to-speech software 
that is powered by a team of trained human staff, called health advocates. A 
summary of the platform is shown in Figure 1. Note that the Family Portal and 
Provider Portal depi[INVESTIGATOR_669322].coach device that will not be activated for the purposes of this study. These 
features provide patient-avatar interaction summaries to the providers and, if 
approved by [CONTACT_102], to family members.
Figure 1. care.coach Avatar Platform
The care.coach patient-facing interface appears as a virtual animal avatar on a 
touch-screen handheld device. Patients interact with the avatar by [CONTACT_669357][INVESTIGATOR_669323]. This simple interface allows many users to be 
engaged effectively. The avatar has two states: awake and asleep. When the avatar 
is visually sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007], the audiovisual (AV) stream is offline. To awaken the avatar 
on-demand, it must be tapped on the touchscreen device. When the avatar is 
visually awake, the care.coach staff-monitored AV stream will become active. 
Several times per day, the avatar will attempt to engage the patient spontaneously 
to provide key reminders, such as for hydration or activity, and initiate patient 
education modules. 
If a patient participant is not available, does not respond, or the participant 
requests privacy, the avatar will go back to sleep. Whenever the avatar is visually 
awake, care.coach staff members monitor the AV streams from the avatar device 
to hear, see and interpret what users are saying and what is happening in the 
environment. This enables the care.coach staff to speak to study participants 
PROTOCOL TITLE: Development and Pi[INVESTIGATOR_669307]-based Intervention to Support 
Patients Undergoing Stem Cell Transplantation 
13appropriately and have genuinely natural, contextually relevant interactions and 
conversations. What the avatar says is guided by [CONTACT_669358], speed, and automation, but is overseen and directly controlled 
(“supervised”) by [CONTACT_215798].coach staff to ensure that the avatar talks with patients in a 
sensible, appropriate, and empathic manner. In the case of an emergency when 
communicating with the avatar, the care.coach team will contact [CONTACT_669359] (number will be provided at patient enrollment) and ask for the nurse 
assigned. A removable cover will be provided for the camera if patients desire at 
time of enrollment.  
Health advocates contribute to the system their human abilities for natural 
language processing and compassionate conversational responses to help each 
avatar build personal relationships. While health advocates are not clinicians, they 
have a minimum set of certifications (Section 8.3). 
Figure 2:  patient using the “tap to wake” feature on avatar
Additionally, the abilities are augmented through a software-driven system 
embedded into the work interface, which guides participants through modules that 
aim to mitigate falls and delirium, executing cognitive exercises. Modules have 
been reviewed by [CONTACT_669360]. An analysis of the focus group on Aim [ADDRESS_904033] each complete the 
following screening mechanisms and training certifications (or their equivalents 
deemed by [CONTACT_215798].coach, as specific training courses and providers become 
outdated/available from time-to-time), through several online learning platforms, 
over the course of approximately 65 hours:
1. care.coach psychometric, technical, skills-based, and face-to-face interview 
assessment

3. Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario delirium, dementia and 
depression course
4. National Institutes of Health privacy and ethics course for human subjects 
research
5. MGB basic motivational interviewing class
6. care.coach technology, patient support, information security, and job 
shadowing training
The qualification process is stringent, and the proportion of health advocate job 
applicants who successfully complete all the required certifications and are hired 
is only about 1%. For the proposed project, each health advocate will also attend a  
specific one-hour training about RIC HCT provided by [CONTACT_6283]. Abel and Kelkar.
8.4 Study Procedures 
In Aim 1, a focus group consisting of focus group consisting of DF/BWH Cancer 
Center HCT nurse navigators, inpatient HCT nurses, and HCT physicians and 
extenders will he held to discuss the feasibility and benefits of implementing an 
avatar-based artificial intelligence system in an inpatient HCT setting (See 
Appendix B for draft script). The care.coach technology as described in Section 
8.[ADDRESS_904034] patients. Participants will receive $50 gift cards for 
participation. The findings of this focus group will further shape the development 
of educational scripts incorporated into the care.coach technology. 
In Aim 2, the care.coach device will be provided to a total of 18 patients (3 
cohorts of 6 patients) who fall within the eligibility requirements outlined in 
Section 3.2 and who consent to participating in the study. Participants will receive 
the device while admitted at the Brigham and Women’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_669324], 
and the device will be collected by [CONTACT_569781].

9.0 Data and Specimen Banking
9.1 Data Collected by [CONTACT_215798].coach: Only meta-data will be collected through 
the avatar device. care.coach will be provided with a first-name, study-
assigned patient number, and in-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_669325], but 
will not be provided with other PHI. Upon completion of the study, name 
[CONTACT_669370]-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_669326]-coach. Audiovisual streams are recorded for immediate 
language processing and understanding but will not be stored post-
processing. See Appendix C for care.coach security protocols.
9.2 Data Collected by [CONTACT_375085]-Farber: No specimens will be collected or 
stored as part of this study. We will collect data on feasibility outcomes 
(retention, satisfaction, completion of modules) via post-pi[INVESTIGATOR_669327], at first follow up at Dana-Farber after 
discharge, or via telephone (Appendix A). Components of post-pi[INVESTIGATOR_669328] (Q1-19) were adapted from a 
published system usability scale.13 Questions on self-efficacy (Q20-28) 
were directly adapted from the General Self-Efficacy Scale.14 The 
remaining questions were newly developed for this study. Data will also 
be collected on patient demographics, transplant characteristics (type of 
transplant, donor characteristics, conditioning, GVHD prophylaxis, 
antibiotic prophylaxis, status of prior infectious diseases), and transplant 
outcomes (incidence and severity of GVHD, other infectious and non-
infectious complications, relapse, survival). PHI will be stored with these 
data to allow for monitoring of long-term outcomes. Data will be stored on 
a secure server at DFCI up to [ADDRESS_904035] (dependent on whether we proceed to the 
Phase 2 study). One year after completion of the study, long-term 
analyses, and publication of deidentified findings, all PHI will be 
destroyed.

10.0 Data Management and Confidentiality  
10.1 Data Analysis: 
Aim 1: This will be a qualitative study, consisting of a focus group of 8-10 
subjects consisting of DF/BWH Cancer Center HCT nurse navigators, 
inpatient HCT nurses, and HCT physicians and extenders. The objective 
of Aim [ADDRESS_904036] likely to benefit from the avatar, timing of avatar 
device delivery, length of time with the avatar, and other potential uses for 
the avatar. After enrollment (as described in Section 5.0 ), we will 
undertake the focus group using a semi-structured guide (Appendix C), in 
which we will present each topic and ask for feedback. The focus group 
will be conducted either virtually using videoconference software or on-
site at DFCI depending on the current state of the pandemic at the time of 
the focus group. The session will last approximately 60 minutes, will be 
audio-recorded, and will be transcribed verbatim. The interview guide will 
be further developed by [CONTACT_473], and we will consult the Dana-
Farber/Harvard Cancer Center (DF/HCC) Survey and Data Management 
Core for help in reviewing our final guide (although we will run the focus 
groups ourselves). We will explore the themes listed in the Table in 
Appendix C, which have been developed based on areas of highest need in 
our transplant program to improve patient experience and outcomes. We 
will request feedback from the group about the utility of different 
transplant education topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102], frequency of interruptions, and other potential 
uses of the avatar and recommendations for modifications to improve 
usability, feasibility, and utility of the avatar. In addition to soliciting 
feedback from all participants, we will perform in-depth explorations of 
components of the avatar functions for which each type of participant is 
considered a topi[INVESTIGATOR_669329]. For example, we will seek advice on optimal 
timing and frequency of patient interruptions from bedside transplant 
nurses who are most closely involved in direct patient care and are most 
familiar with patient needs and attention spans. The investigators will 
analyze all transcribed interviews through an interactive approach using 
framework analysis.[ADDRESS_904037] refined in prior work,16,17 
two team members will review transcripts independently using an 
electronic research journal (NVivo 12 Pro) to create a coding matrix, after 
which they will compare results until reliability and interpretive 
consistency of coding is established (80% agreement). We will keep a 
thorough audit trail that will allow for other team members to carefully 
review and confirm that conclusions clearly flow from the coding, thus 
enhancing interpretive rigor and credibility. The study team will integrate 
PROTOCOL TITLE: Development and Pi[INVESTIGATOR_669307]-based Intervention to Support 
Patients Undergoing Stem Cell Transplantation 
17findings from the focus group into the functions of the avatar to optimize 
the device functions for our patients.
Aim 2: We will enroll 18 patients in a single-arm pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268]/feasibility study 
testing the care.coach avatar. The goal of the study is to determine if the 
avatar achieves the prespecified usability and feasibility outcome goals. 
As is common for HCT studies,18 the following covariates will be 
collected for each enrolled patient from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_669330], with the support of 
the consulting biostatistician: incidence of delirium, falls, falls with injury, 
and sitter utilization, length of stay, use of benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_33286], 
fluid “ins/outs” and meal fractions from nursing notes, in-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_669331], 
neutrophil and platelet counts at fixed durations post-transplant, and 
incidence and severity of transplant-related complications including graft 
failure, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), thrombotic microangiopathies 
(TMA), venous thrombosis, hemorrhage, acute infections and viral 
reactivations, idiopathic pneumonia syndromes, vaso-occlusive disease 
(VOD), cytokine release syndrome, mucositis, engraftment syndromes, 
and posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES). Demographic 
variables between groups, including age, gender, education, and 
race/ethnicity collected upon enrollment will be compared to confirm 
equivalency and randomization. Primary and secondary usability and 
feasibility outcomes are summarized in Table 1. Each metric will be 
analyzed using paired t-tests to compare between groups and analysis of 
covariance to adjust for possible differences in demographics or initial 
assessments (baseline) between groups. Binary measures will entail chi-
squared comparisons of proportions between groups. All data will be 
analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences software (SPSS, 
Inc. Chicago, IL). Statistical significance will be defined as p ≤ 0.05.

Patients Undergoing Stem Cell Transplantation 
1810.2 Sample Size:
Aim 1: Aim 1. We selected a focus group size of 8-10 subjects. As per 
Krueger and Casey’s “Focus groups: A practical guide for applied 
research,” the ideal size of a focus group is 8-10 subjects because 
participants in a smaller focus group may feel pressure to talk more than 
they would otherwise, while larger focus groups will limit detail of 
participants’ responses who may feel pressure to share airtime.19
Aim 2: A sample size of [ADDRESS_904038] three years, 
with approximately 33% (54 patients) being performed inpatient, and 
estimated that approximately 33% could be enrolled, resulting in an 
achievable pi[INVESTIGATOR_513933] 18 patients. Second, we ensured that the 
“rule of 10” for binary outcomes, wherein at least 10 participants per arm 
allows for reliable estimates in pi[INVESTIGATOR_7602] (10 total in a single arm pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], 
such as ours), was met.[ADDRESS_904039], we wanted to ensure that there were 
sufficient patients in three smaller cohorts to allow for an iterative process 
of improving the technology over the course of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], as per the 
guidance from the NIH SBIR process. With six patients per cohort, we 
should be able to achieve sufficient data for assessing usability.21
10.3 Milestones and Success Criteria:     
PRIMARY: Retention rate in protocol from enrollment to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_669321] (whichever comes first) of over 66%. 
SECONDARY: Patient satisfaction rate with avatar in the final cohort of 
80%; rate of completion of 80% of the HCT educational modules of 75%; 
rate of completion of post- pi[INVESTIGATOR_669334] 1 week of discharge of 
90%.  
10.4 Risk Mitigation and Alternative Strategies: After each group of 5 we 
will assess patient feedback and modify the avatar program; this iterative 
design will allow for rapid protocol improvements to be deployed to new 
patients in subsequent cohorts to move towards achieving the success 
criteria above. In case outcomes are disappointing during the first cohort, 
we may switch to a more frequent iteration rate, in conjunction with the 
advice of our consulting biostatistician.
11.[ADDRESS_904040] information to withdraw after agreeing to 
participate and will be able to terminate their participation in the focus 
group or interview at any point. Their demographic information will not 
be used at that point; for focus group participants, it will not be possible to 
remove their data from the audio transcription; for individual interviewees, 
PROTOCOL TITLE: Development and Pi[INVESTIGATOR_669307]-based Intervention to Support 
Patients Undergoing Stem Cell Transplantation 
19their interview data will be deleted. Subject withdrawal reason(s) will be 
attempted to be obtained. In certain situations, such as severe 
encephalopathy or critical illness, patients may be withdrawn from the 
trial by [CONTACT_669361].
12.0 Risks to Subjects
12.1 Anticipated Risks   
Aim 1: Anticipated risks to participants include the potential risk of 
compromise of participant confidentiality due to use of video conferencing 
groups. For the focus group associated risks, the study team will explain to 
participants the procedures that will be employed to ensure privacy and 
confidentiality, and situations such as the focus group discussions where 
these are not entirely possible. Procedures that will be taken to ensure 
confidentiality include de-identifying all the data collected from the focus 
group and storing in a password encoded database.     
Aim 2: Anticipated risks to participants include the potential risk of 
compromise of participant confidentiality and loss of confidentiality of 
their data collected by [CONTACT_669362]. Psychological risks include 
embarrassment and stigmatization if there is inadvertent disclosure of 
confidential information, and distress due to losing a friendship with the 
avatar at the end of the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]. While it is very common to develop a 
friendship with the avatar and ending such a relationship is generally a 
negative experience, due to the context of the relatively short-term 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408], it is expected that patients will overall be happy to be 
discharged and they will not be led to believe that the avatar will be with 
them for the long-term.
12.2 Unanticipated Risks
Any unanticipated event will be reported to the OHRS. All human subjects 
will be informed of their right to stop participation at any time. Subjects 
will be notified of their right not to answer any questions or choosing to no 
longer participate. If a participant experiences distress, they can contact 
[INVESTIGATOR_124]. Gregory Abel at [EMAIL_12782] or [PHONE_13910] or 
[CONTACT_669372] at [EMAIL_12783]. 
12.0 Potential Benefits to Subjects  
Aim 1: There is no direct benefit expected for participants except for the $[ADDRESS_904041].
PROTOCOL TITLE: Development and Pi[INVESTIGATOR_669307]-based Intervention to Support 
Patients Undergoing Stem Cell Transplantation 
20Aim 2: Participants may potentially benefit from participating in the study by 
[CONTACT_669363]. Participants in the third cohort will receive a 
$[ADDRESS_904042] of this potential benefit 
when planning the subsequent randomized trial.
13.0 Community-Based Participatory Research
Not applicable. 
14.0 Sharing of Results with Subjects
Given constraints on study resources and the exploratory nature of the study, we 
do not plan to disseminate study findings or individual results directly to 
participants; however, participants will hopefully be able to view publications that 
arise from this study in oncology journals.
15.0 Setting 
Aim 1: Participants will be selected and recruited purposively via recruitment 
emails. The focus group will be held over a secured Zoom conference call to 
abide by [CONTACT_669364]-19 
pandemic. 
Aim 2: Potentially eligible patients identified in weekly transplant sign-out round 
meetings will be approached and those who consent will be given the device at 
the time of their admission for RIC HCT at Brigham and Women’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. 
16.0 Resources Available 
DFCI: Drs. Abel and [CONTACT_669373] both have experience with care delivery research. 
The study will be supported by [CONTACT_669365]. 
17.0 Prior Approvals 
Aim 1: We will request a waiver documentation of informed consent, although all 
elements of informed consent will be included in the focus group script. 
(Appendix B).
Aim 2: N/A.
18.0 Recruitment Methods 
 
PROTOCOL TITLE: Development and Pi[INVESTIGATOR_669307]-based Intervention to Support 
Patients Undergoing Stem Cell Transplantation 
21Aim 1: HCT nurse navigators, inpatient HCT nurses, and HCT physicians and 
extenders will be selected and recruited purposively via recruitment emails 
Aim 2: We will use weekly transplant sign-out meetings to identify 
potentially eligible patients. Communication with all potential participants 
will contain all the elements of informed consent and potential participants 
will also be made aware that the study team will keep personal identifiers 
confidential by [CONTACT_669366]. Patient information will be kept in a database that is password 
protected and utilized only at DFCI. This will ensure that ineligible 
patients are not contact[CONTACT_669367]-participants 
affected. 
19.0 Local Number of Subjects  
Aim 1: 8-10 participants for the focus group. 
Aim 2: [ADDRESS_904043] the Privacy Interests of Subjects
Subjects' demographic data will be deidentified, as described above, and contact 
[CONTACT_58560] a secured database on a password-protected 
computer accessible only to DFCI study team personnel. Participants will be 
informed of the steps taken to secure their data privacy during the consent 
process.
21.0 Compensation for Research-Related Injury
This research involves minimal risk to subjects; therefore, this is not applicable. 
22.0  Economic Burden to Subjects   
We anticipate no additional costs to subjects for enrollment in this study. 
23.0 Consent Process 
Those unable to consent for themselves are not involved in this research. 
Informed consent will be required for all participants. 
Aim 1: As this Aim is minimal risk and involves no procedures for which written 
documentation of consent is normally required outside of the research context, we 
request that written documentation of consent be waived. Oral consent language is 
included in all recruitment communications with participants (see appendices). 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_669335]. 
PROTOCOL TITLE: Development and Pi[INVESTIGATOR_669307]-based Intervention to Support 
Patients Undergoing Stem Cell Transplantation 
22Participants will be shown the script on the video conference screen, which 
includes all elements of informed consent (Appendix B). Participants will be 
asked to verbally confirm their consent at the time of the meeting. This verbal 
confirmation will serve as documentation of consent. We request that written 
documentation of consent be waived.  
Aim 2: Informed consent will be required for all participants in the study. The RA 
will document consent with the participant’s wet-ink signature. All participants 
will receive a copy of the completed consent form for their records. 
24.0 Process to Document Consent in Writing  
25.1. Aim 1: This research presents no more than minimal risk of harm to subjects 
and involves no procedures for which written documentation of consent is 
normally required outside of the research context. As such, we request that the 
IRB waive the requirement to obtain written documentation of consent. During all 
participant contacts, all the required elements of informed consent will be 
included, as are outlined in the Appendices.  
25.2. Aim 2: We will be obtaining written consent for this study per SOP: 
Informed Consent Process (CON-100). Once a potentially eligible subject is 
admitted, the RA will approach the subject. If the subject is interested, the RA 
will document consent with the participant’s wet-ink signature. The RA will 
consent the first [ADDRESS_904044]. Abel.

Introduction and Welcome 
Welcome and thank you for taking the time to be part of this focus group session. We are
working on a study to determine appropriate modifications to care.coach, an avatar-based 
care  support platform, for the inpatient HCT setting. The information from this 
discussion will be used to develop educational modules that will be provided to patients 
undergoing HCT. 
This session is being audio recorded because we don’t want to miss any of your
comments. People often say very helpful things in these discussions, and we can’t write
fast enough to get them all down. You can introduce your name [CONTACT_669371], but there will be no names attached to comments in our reports. We also ask each
of you to keep everything that is discussed today confidential. To prevent feedback and
distraction, we ask that each of you please turn off your cell phones so that the session is
not interrupted and, if you are not already in a quiet place, please move to one if you are
able. For recording purposes, it is best if we speak one at a time.
My role here, as the moderator, is to guide the discussion by [CONTACT_669369]. I will be asking you some questions that we have developed, and we are
interested in your thoughts. There are no wrong answers and we do not expect everyone
to agree, but rather it is important to know if people have differing points of view. Please
know, however, that you can skip any question you do not wish to answer. I will also
occasionally interrupt and move us to a new topic to keep us on time, thank you for your
understanding if this occurs. I will turn on the audio-recorder now. Let us begin the
discussion. 
Topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102]: [Moderator will ask questions that probe the following themes] 
1. Educational topi[INVESTIGATOR_669350]?
… Diet selection, exercise, medication use, common symptoms, when to call for 
help, catheter flushing, others?
2. Check-in frequency?
… At meal times only? Morning? Afternoon? Night? Total number of check-ins 
per day?
3. Which populations would most benefit? 
…Older patients? Younger? RIC? MAC? Specific regimens?
4. When should care.coach be given to patients?
…Before the transplant admission? On the date of admission for transplant? On 
the date of transplant? Several days after transplant? Other?
5. When should care.coach be taken back from the patient?
…On the date of transplant? Several days after transplant? At the time of 
discharge? At the time of completion of the educational modules? Other?
6. What other functions do you think this technology could be used for?

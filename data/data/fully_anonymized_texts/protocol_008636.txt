No formal h ypotheses are formulated for the primary  effectiveness
endpoint of distance VA; hence, no inferential testing will be 
performed. Descriptive summary  statistics will be provided for the 
Snellen categories as well as the converted logMAR values. 
The s ample size calculation was based on previous extended wear 
clinical studies which evaluated five currently  marketed silicone 
hydrogel lenses. Assuming that the expected d ifference between 
test and control is 0 and that the control proportion is 0.045, a 
sample size of 213 per group will provide 80% power to reject the 
null hy pothesis of inferiority  in test compared to control, with a 
noninferiority  margin of 0.05 (5%).

associated with subject harm (ie, ADE or SADE); however , not all ADEs or SADEs are due 
to a device deficie ncy. The Investigator should determine the applicable category listed in the

Failure to m eet product specifications (eg, incorrect lens power/diameter/base 
curve/color)
Lens cloud y
Lens surface/edge defect 
Torn lens during handling/in pack
Packaging deficit (eg, mislabeled product)
Suspect product contamination
Lack of performance
11.[ADDRESS_41837] questions:
“Have you had an y health problems since your last study  visit? ”
“Have there been an y changes in the medicines you take since your last study  visit? ”
Changes in any pr otocol -specific parameters and/or questionnair es evaluated during the 
study  are to be reviewed by  [CONTACT_737] . Any untoward (unfavorable and unintended) 
change in a pr otocol -specific parameter or questionnair e response that is clinically  relevant, 
in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_2511] I nvestigator , is to be reporte d as an AE. These clinically  relevant 
changes will be reported regardless of causality . 
11.3 Procedures for Recording and Reporting
AEs are collected from the time of informed consent. Any pre -existing medical conditions or 
signs/sy mptoms present in a subject prior to the start of the study  (ie, before informed 
consent is signed) are not considered AEs in the study  and should be recorded in the Medical 
History  section of the eCRF .
In addition, temporary  lens awareness or visual changes during the fitting proces s are not 
considered AEs if the Investigator assesses that the sy mptom(s) can reasonably  resolve within 
the anticipated adaptation period.

ADEs or SAEs are documented on the Serious Adverse Event and Adverse Device 
Effect eCRF within 24 hours of the Investigator ’s or site ’s awareness .
Device deficiencies are documented on the Device Deficiency eCRF within 24 hours 
of the Investigator ’s or site ’s awareness .
A printed cop y of the completed Serious Adverse Event and Adverse Device Effect 
and/or Device De ficiency eCRF must be included with product returns.
Additional relevant information after initial reporting must be entered into the eCRF as 
soon as the data become available.
Document an y changes to concomitant medications on the appropriate eCRFs.
Docum ent all relevant information from Discharge Summary , Autopsy  Report, 
Certificate of Death, etc, if applicable, in narrative section of the Serious Adverse 
Event and Adverse Device Effect eCRF .
Note: Should the EDC system become non -operational, the site mu st complete the 
appropriate paper Serious Adverse Event and Adverse Device Effect and/or Device Deficiency
Form. The completed form is emailed to the Study
 Sponsor at 
according to the timelines outlined above; however, the reported in formation must be entered 
into the EDC sy stem once it becomes operational.
Additionally , any AEs and device deficiencies for non- study  marketed devices/products (ie, 
CLEAR CARE Cleaning and Disinfecting Solution, LacriPure (or equivalent ),and Systane
preservative -free eye drops) will be considered and processed as spontaneous (following the 
postmarket vigilance procedures) and should be communicated to the device’s/product’s 
manufacturer as per local requirements.
Study  Sponsor representatives may  be contact[CONTACT_40064] y protocol related question ;their 
contact [CONTACT_40065].
Further, depending upon the nature of the AE or device deficiency  being reported, the Study  
Sponsor may  request copi[INVESTIGATOR_40032]’s medical records. The 
Investigator must also report all AEs and device deficiencies that could have led to a SADE 
according to the requirements of regulatory  authorities or I RB/IEC.
Intensity and Causality Assessments
Where appr opriate, the Investigator must assess the intensity  (severit y) of the AE based upon 
medical judgment with consideration of an y subjective symptom(s), as defined below:

Protocol - Clinical
16-Jan-2020

Page 66of 78
Intensity (Severity)
Mild An AE is mild if the subject is aware of but can easily  tolera te the sign or 
symptom.
Moderate An AE is moderate if the sign or s ymptom results in discomfort significant 
enough to cause interference with the subject ’s usual activities.
Severe An AE is severe if the sign or sy mptom is incapacitating and results in the
subject ’s inability  to work or engage in their usual activities.
For every  AE in the study , the Investigator must assess the causalit y (Related or Not Related 
to the medical device or study  procedure). An assessment of causality  will also be performed 
by [CONTACT_13302], as shown below:
Causality
Related An AE classified as related may  be either definitely  related or possibl y related 
where a direct cause and ef fect relationship with the medical device or study  
procedure has not been demonstrated, but there is a reasonable possibility  that 
the AE was caused by  [CONTACT_13303] y procedure.
Not Related An AE classified as not related may  either be definitely  unrelated or simply  
unlikely  to be related (ie, there are other more likely  causes for the AE).
The Study  Sponsor will assess the AEs and may  upgrade the Investigator ’s assessment of 
seriousness and/or causality . The Study  Sponsor will notify  the Investigator of an y AEs that 
are upgraded from non -serious to serious or from unrelated to related.
Additionally , the Study  Sponsor shall immediately conduct an evaluation of any  
unanticipated adverse device effect, including anticipated adverse events that occur in 
unanticipated severity  or frequency . The results of this evalu ation will be reported to the
FDA, the IRB
,and participating Investigators within [ADDRESS_41838] associated with device deficiencies and/or product related AEs [ie , 
ADE or SADE] will be returned for investigation as detailed in the MOP .

unmasking the information if there is suf ficient time. Dependent upon the individual 
circumstances (ie, medical emergency), th e code may  be broken prior to contact [CONTACT_40066] . The Study Sponsor must be informed of all cases in which the code was 
broken and of the circumstances involved. Additionally , the Study  Sponsor may  be required 
to unmask the information in order to fulfill expedited regulatory  requirements.
11.6 Follow -Up of Subjects with Adverse Events 
The Investigator is responsible for adequate and safe medical care of subjects during the 
study  and for ensuring that appropriate medical care and relevant follow -up procedures are 
maintained after the study . 
The Investigator should provide the Study  Sponsor with any  new safet y information (which 
includes new AEs and changes to previousl y reported AEs) that may  affect the safet y 
evaluation of the device. For AEs that are unresolved/ongoing at time of subject exit from 
study , any additional information received at follow-up should be documented in the eCRFs 
up to study  completion (ie, database lock).
Any additional data received up to 3month safter subject discontinuation or exit must be 
documented and available upon the Study  Sponsor’s request. All complaints received after 
this time period will be considered and processed as spontaneous (following the postmarket 
vigilance procedures) and should be communicated to the medical device’s manufacturer as 
per local requirements, as applicable.
The Investigator should also report complaints on non -Alcon products directly  to the 
manufacturer as per the manufacturer’s instructions or local regulatory  requirements.
11.7 Pregnancy in the Clinical Study
Pregnancy  is not reportable as an AE; however , complications may  be reportable and will be 
decided on a case -by-case basis. Should a woman become pregnant during study  
participation, the pregnancy  will be documented on the Medical H istoryeCRF .

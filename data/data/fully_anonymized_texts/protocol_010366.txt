Study Protocol and Statistical Analysis Plan 
Patient selection  
Adult patients (age>18 years) receiving electiv e cardiac surgery requiring cardiopulmonary 
by[CONTACT_569500] -October 2021. Written informed consent was 
obtained from eligible patients prior to surgery. Patients were excluded if they had a nitroglycerin 
allergy, were taking oral phosphodiesterase inhibitors, were unable to tolerate microcirculatory flow image acquisition or did not have a pulmonary artery catheter for continuous cardiac output 
monitoring after surgery. Patients only received the study drug if they met the clinical criteria for 
circulatory shock, defined as having postoperative vasopressor -dependent hypotension or low 
cardiac output requiring inotropic support, with signs of end -organ injury (capi[INVESTIGATOR_95155] > 3 
seconds, lactate > 2, SvO2 < 60%). A seco nd cohort of patients were enrolled to serve as a 
preoperative control, which were matched to the experimental group for age, co -morbidities, and 
planned operation. Study data were collected and recorded using a well -established clinical 
database tool (REDCap, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN) hosted at the University of 
Pennsylvania

Study design and drug administration 
This investigator -initiated, open -label study was conducted at the Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_133199], an urban quaternary  academic medical center. The study was approved by [CONTACT_569501]’s institutional review board, registered with ClinicalTrials.gov 
([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]), and conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. 
Sample size w as determined based on an anticipated 30% increase in TVD, and setting a one - 
sided α of 0.1, and ß of 0.8. A 1% topi[INVESTIGATOR_569495] 400 mcg of nitroglycerin ([COMPANY_007] Pharmaceuticals,  [LOCATION_001], NY, 
[LOCATION_003]) in 4mL of sterile water within a dropper bottle that would administer the solution in 0.05mL 
aliquots. Two drops (0.1 mL) of the 1% nitroglycerin solution (5 mcg or 2.27*10−2 μmol per  drop)  
were applied to the sublingual space  after obtaining baseline post -operative microcirculation 
images. A microdosing (approximately 1/50th of the lowest therapeutic sublingual dose) was 
administered to avoid any systemic effects. 
 
Microcirculatory imaging and analysis  
Sublingual  microcirculation  imaging  was performed  using HVM  (CytoCam,  Braedius  Medical  BV, 
the Netherlands)  in the preoperative staging  area (for controls) or within 2 hours of arriving to the 
intensive care unit after  surgery by a trained member of the investigative team (JCG or FMT)3. 
The sublingual microcirculation was measured at 3 time points: baseline, [ADDRESS_746649]’s tongue until an adequate view of the microcirculation was 
obtained. A series of six second video clips (120 frames) duration were taken at each time point 
with attention to quality factors, especially the absence of pressure artifac t, excess saliva, and 
proper location in accordance with the accepted consensus for microcirculation analysis. Image 
quality was assessed using the 6 -factor Massey quality score, which scores each video for 
appropriate illumination, duration, focus, content, stability, and pressure. Images were only 
included in the final analysis if the Massey quality score was < 10 4. Acceptable clips were 
deidentified and coded for analysis after enrollment was  complete. 
 
Microcirculation videos were exported using commer cial software (CCTools 2, Braedius Medical 
BV, the Netherlands) and manually analyzed using the validated Automated Vascular Analysis 
software  (AVA  3.2; Microvision  Medical  B.V.,  the Netherlands).  Video  analysis  was performed  by 
[CONTACT_109549] (JCG and FMT) who were blinded to the conditions of the subject. Only 
microvessels < [ADDRESS_746650] practice 
guidelines for microcirculation imaging5. Blo od flow within each microvessel was graded using a 
semiquantitative scale, based on the vascular flow pattern ranging from 0 -3 (0=no flow, 
1=intermittent, 2=sluggish, or 3=continuous flow). Vessel perfusion was dichotomized as 
nonperfused (no flow or intermittent flow) or perfused (continuous or sluggish) for the calculation 
of PPV and  PVD.  
 
Individual pharmacodynamic response to the nitroglycerin challenge  
An exploratory analysis was planned to identify the incidence of a patient specific 
pharmacodynamic r esponse to the nitroglycerin challenge. A PD response threshold was set as 
a post -administration PVD > 1.[ADDRESS_746651] deviations from the baseline, which was calculated by 
[CONTACT_569502]-patient  variance  between the three baseline  PVD video sequences, which was 
then pooled across the entire cohort. This 1.8SD threshold was set to achieve 90 percent confidence  interval (assuming  a one-sided alpha,  since there was only an anticipated increase  in 
PVD). This method has been used in previous Phase [ADDRESS_746652] demographics, pre -operative risk score (euroSCORE II) and medical history were 
collected during initial screening. Cardiac index (CI), central venous pressure (CVP), pulmonary 
artery  pressure (PAP),  and mixed  venous oxygen saturation  (SvO 2) were continuously  monitored 
by [CONTACT_569503] (Edwards Lifesciences LLC, Irvine, CA, [LOCATION_003]). Arterial blood 
pressure was measured continuously using a standard invasive arterial line. Systemic hemodynamic data,  vasopressor infusion  doses,  and mixed  venous oxygen saturation  were 
recorded  at baseline then every 3 minutes for 30 minutes after application of the topi[INVESTIGATOR_569496]7. The vasopressor -inotrope score (VIS) was calculated to summarize the 
degree of post -operative vasoactive support was required at the time of the study8.

Statistical Analysis  
Data normality was assessed using the D’Agostino -Pearson omnibus normality test. Global 
hemodynamic and microcirculation  variabl es are reported  as mean  ± SD. Variables  that were  not 
normally distributed are reported as median with interquartile range [25th – 75th percentiles]. 
Student t-test was used to test for differences between normally distributed variables. Mann - 
Whitney U te st was used to analyze non- normal data. Repeated measure one -way ANOVA with 
Tukey’s post -hoc testing was used to assess for changes in microcirculatory function during the 
nitroglycerin challenge. Inter -rater reliability between coders was assessed in 10% of the videos 
using a Bland -Altman plot. Statistical analysis was conducted using Prism v 8.0 (Graph -Pad 
Software, San Diego, CA). Statistical significance was assumed at p < 0.05.

Introduction:  
 
Neuropathic pain is a common complaint in those with spi[INVESTIGATOR_1828] (SCI) that has a 
significant negative effect on quality of life. This makes the treatm ent of neuropathic pain 
a priority in the SCI population. Efficacy of v arious treatments, however, remains 
controve rsial. There is evidence to support that gabapentin and pregabalin have some 
benefit in reducing neuropathic pain (1). Other positive effects  of gabapentin on those 
with SCI have also been demonstrated. However, there has not been a study on the 
influence of timing of initiation of gabapentin on the efficacy of using it to treat 
neuropathic pain in the SCI population. Such a finding could chang e the standard of care 
in treatment of acute SCI.  
 
The pooled prevalenc e of neuropathic pain post spi[INVESTIGATOR_222599] y is 53% (2). Not only 
common, neuropathic pain is pervasive, affecting aspects of patients’ live s including 
sleep, physical function, and mo od that in turn impact their activities — work and 
recreational alike (3 ). Thus, neuropathic pain management contrib utes to quality of life 
for a majority of people with SCI.  
 
Although a high priority, the treatment of neuropathic pain in SCI remains notori ously 
difficult (4). Treatments options may be divided into pharmacolog ic and non -
pharmacologic. Pharmacologic agen ts studied include amitriptyline, gabapentin, 
pregabalin, opi[INVESTIGATOR_858], lidocaine, ketamine, valproate, lamotrigine, levetiracetam and 
carbamazepi [INVESTIGATOR_050]; the most studied of which are amitriptyline, gabapentin, and pregab alin 
(5). 
 
Gabapentin’s potential is not lim ited to neuropathic pain management, making it a 
particularly compelling treatment option in the population with acute SCI. Gabapentin 
leads to improvement in total motor scores (6 -9), reduced spasticity, reduced  autonomic 
dysreflexia, and improved mood (8 , 9). Animal models suggest it may be neuroprotective 
in the acute phase of injury (10). In those who undergo spi[INVESTIGATOR_79477], regardless of 
presence of SCI, gabapentin given perioperatively leads to reduced opi[INVESTIGATOR_645316] -operative pe riod (11). Additionally, when compared to narcotic 
alternatives, gabapentin has minimal side effects.  
 
Neuropathic pain in SCI is common, imp actful, and difficult to treat. Gabapentin is 
effective in the manageme nt of symptoms and concerns related to SCI i ncluding motor 
recovery, spasticity, and mood among others. This makes gabapentin an important 
pharmacologic intervention, which compels prov iders to define treatment guidelines 
related to its use. One aspect of which should relate to the timing of initiat ion of therapy. 
The goal of this study is to determine whether early initiation of treatment with 
gabapentin will decrease average pain score s and opi[INVESTIGATOR_645317]. G abapentin, 
although used commonly, is not started in all patients with acute SCI but is often started 
at the onset of neuropathic pain. If ga bapentin is found to be more effective when 
initiated early, it would b e reasonable to start gabapentin immediately  following acute 
SCI in all patients in whom it is not otherwise contraindicated.  
 
 
1. Objectives  
 
- Primary  
To determine if the time from injury influences the prevalence of neuropathic pain 
in acute SCI  
To determine  if the use of gabapentin in the early acute  period influences the 
prevalence of neuropathic pain in patients with acute SCI  
To compare the efficacy of acute verses  subacute initiation  of gabapentin in 
treating neuropathic pain in SCI  
 
- Secondary  
To compar e the overall pain scores  
To determi ne the prevalence of neuropathic pain  in those with SCI at admission 
and discharge to the inpatient rehabilitation hospi[INVESTIGATOR_645318] ( FIM) 
To compare the change in total motor score on the ASIA impairment scale  
To identify side effects of treatment with gabapentin and their frequency  
 
 
2. Endpoints  
 
Primar y 
o Presence of neuropathic pain at time of enrollment and again around t ime of 
discharge ( Douleur Neuropathique 4 , DN4) 
o Neuropathic pain level (Neuropathic Pain Scale, NPS)  at time of enrollment 
and again around time of discharge  
 
Secondary  
o Average pain lev el recorded in nursing flowsheet (Numeric Pain Rating Scale, 
NPRS)  
o Week ly total u se of opi[INVESTIGATOR_858] (total morphine mill igram equivalents , MME)  
o Change in FIM during rehabilitation   
o Change in total motor score on the A SIA impairment scale during entire 
rehabilitation course  
o Side effects attributed directly to gabapentin in physicia n documentation and 
whether or not gabapentin was stopped due to these side effects  
 
 
3. Design  
 
- Prospective , observational, cohort,  single cen ter study  
- The study will enroll subjects with acute spi[INVESTIGATOR_645319] (MRI ). 
- After enrollment, subjects will be followed through the end of their acute 
rehabilitation stay including any interruption in rehabilitation for wh ich they require 
ED evaluation and/or acute hospi[INVESTIGATOR_645320] . 
- Around the time of  enrollment, subjects will be asked to complete the DN4 
questionnai re and the NPS.  
- Around the time of discharge, subjects will be asked to  complete a second DN4 
questionnaire and the  NPS. 
- The remainder of the data collection will be through review of the patient’s electronic 
medical record (EMR).  
- Patients will be divided  into those who first received gabapentin during their acute 
inpatient h ospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], prior to admission to acute rehabilitation, and those who did 
not. Additionally, the timing of gabapentin initiation will also be recorded.

confidentiality, any adverse event(s), and external factors or relevant information that 
might hav e an impact on the safety or ethics of the study.  
 
After recruitment, data analysis  will occur and any changes to the risk/bene fit ratio to 
study participation will be identified and reported to the IRB. In addition, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_6254] -
investigators will meet on an annual basis and reports of the meeting will be submitted to 
the IRB.  
 
If an adverse event occurs, it will be reported im mediately to the MetroHealth  
Institutional Review Board (IRB). If an unexpected adverse event occurs, the 
investigators will ass ess the risk/benefit ratio of the study and submit any modifications 
deemed necessar y to the IRB for approval.  At the time of t he IRB renewal, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_645322], the dates that the monthly 
meeting took pl ace, a summary of the cumulative adverse events, external factors or

If you decide to participate in this study you will be told about any new information learned 
during the course of the study that might cause you to change your mind about staying in the 
study.  If you withdraw we will still provide you with information regarding possible impacts to 
your health status or fut ure health care decisions.  
 
Individuals with spi[INVESTIGATOR_645324] a 
commonly used  drug, gabapentin, in  effectively  treating neuropathic pain.  
 
Why is this study being done?  
 
The purpose of this study is to  determine whether or not the timing of the initiation of gabapentin 
after acute spi[INVESTIGATOR_645325].  
 
Patients admitted to Metr oHealth Rehab ilitation Instit ute with acute spi[INVESTIGATOR_645326].  
 
 
What is involved in the study?  
 
Frequency of Visits –  
 
In this study, you will be asked to participate in  two visits, this visit and an additional visit within 
a couple days of  your date of discharge from inpatient rehabilitation. In between, you will be 
asked to complete a pain diary. Each visit will approximatel y 20 minutes . The pain diary should 
take under 1 minute to complete daily . The study visits include:  
 
Screening – Answering questions about yourself and your injury to determine if you are a 
candidate for the study.  
 
Questionnaires – Answering questions a nd undergoing one limited physical examination at each 
of the two visits.  
 
Randomization/study intervention  
 
Treatment with gabapentin for neuropathic pain in spi[INVESTIGATOR_645327]. It is not clear at the present time whether early or later  treatment with gabapentin  is 
better.  For this  reason, the timing that the gabapentin will offered to you will be based on 
chance , the time that you first are treated by a spi[INVESTIGATOR_645328] .  
 
Duration –  
 
This study, will last until you are discharged from inpatient rehabilitation.   
 
What happens if I discontinue or withdraw from the study?  
 
If you withdraw from the study before its completion, you will be asked to specify for what 
reason so that adverse events may be monitored and reported for patient safety . 
 
Investigator -Initiat ed Termination of Participation:  There may be instances that would require 
investigators to terminate the participation of particular subjects (e.g., subject non -compliance

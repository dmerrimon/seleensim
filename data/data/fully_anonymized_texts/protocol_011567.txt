1. Objectives  
1.1. Purpose, specific aims, or objectives:  
 
Aim 1. T o determine feasibility and initial effectiveness of iCanCope with Sickle Cell Pain in 
youth with SCD  pain.  
 Aim 2. T o test  if differences in self -efficacy, self -management behaviors, goal- setting, and 
perceived social support will predict changes in pain intensity and copi[INVESTIGATOR_152257] .  
 Aim 3. T o examine possible moderators of effects of iCanCope with S ickle Cell Pain including 
engagement with treatment, demographic factors (family income, age, sex), and disease characteristics ( SCD  pain burden).  
   
1.2. Hypotheses to be tested:  
   
Youth who receive iCanCope with Sickle Cell Pain  will achieve greater increases in 
adaptive copi[INVESTIGATOR_152258]-related 
disability  (primary outcomes) as well as significant improvements in physical and 
emotional functioning and disease- specific health- related quality of life (secondary 
outcomes) at post -treatment and 6- month follow -up compared to youth who receive the 
attention -contr ol condition. Feasibility and acceptability will be demonstrated by [CONTACT_152300].

ackground  
2.1. Relevant prior experience and gaps in current knowledge: 
   
Limitations of Studies to 
Date  Proposed iCanCope with Sickle Cell Pain Study  
 
• Poor user adherence.  
• Small patient 
samples and included 
those individuals with infrequent SCD pain.  
• Limited pain self -
management content   
 High accessibility using virtual delivery (app, website).  
 Targeted approach to deliver pain self -management to 
patients with identified pain burden.  
 Comprehensive self -management content based on other 
effective CBT pain programs that we have developed  
 Adequate sample size and inclusion of individuals with 
clinically relevant pain as per pain burden score.  
 
 Advances Offered by [CONTACT_152301] a 2014 scopi[INVESTIGATOR_152259],
34 the 
proposed iCanCope with Sickle Cell Pain program  will be comprised of personalized goal setting 
to improve pain and function, CBT -based pain self -management training and rehearsal, and 
peer-based social support through a closed online community for youth with SCD. These 
components will be delivered on the iCanCope smartphone app and be complemented by [CONTACT_152302]-management education on the iCanCope website. The website will also include specific 
modules designed to empower parents and caregivers to promote disease self -management in 
their adolescents.

Protocol Template (HRP -503) Click Template Version: October  [ADDRESS_175415] involving 48 youth (11– 17 years) with a variety of pain 
conditions (e.g., headache, stomachache, musculoskeletal pain), significant reductions 
in pain and disability were found for youth receiving Web- MAP compared to a wait -list 
control group.
[ADDRESS_175416] of Web- MAP involving 273 youth (ages 10- 17 years) 
with chronic pain (and their parents) recruited from pain centers around the U.S. and 
Canada.42 Adjunctive to pain clinic treatment, youth were randomized to one of two 
Internet treatment conditions, Web- MAP (CBT pain intervention, n=138) vs. Web- ED 
(education control, n=135). In our preliminary analyses, significant group- by-time 
interactions were found for effects of Web- MAP on children’s pain- related disability (p = 
.03), sleep quality (p = .02), pain- related anxiety (p < .05), and parent behavior (p < .001) 
and distress (p = .002) at [ADDRESS_175417] been collected from Web- MAP in youth with SCD to 
address concerns raised about youth’s receptivity to learning cognitive- behavioral pain 
management skills. Web- MAP was pi[INVESTIGATOR_66376] 12 youth (M age = 14.2, 68% female) with 
SCD and their parents recruited from Connecticut Children’s and Emory University (propos ed sites in this application). Treatment engagement was high; youth logged into 
Web-MAP  an average of 16.7 times (SD = 10.1, range 2- 38) and parents logged in an 
average of 17.4 times (SD = 10.8, range = 3- 43) over the 8- 10 week treatment period. 
Youth completed an average of 6 out of 8 treatment modules and parents completed an average of 7 out of 8 treatment modules. To understand participants’ experience with Web-MAP, qualitative interviews were conducted with 8 parent -child dyads. Overall, 
participants reported that the CBT program was a helpful tool for copi[INVESTIGATOR_54241]: “I 
learned a lot about pain management and things I can do to make my load a little bit 
easier”. However, they indicated a preference for a web program that is designed specifically for  youth with SCD: “I thought Web- MAP was too simple or basic to help me. 
I want something more interactive that is a more real world experience”. When asked what could be done to improve the web program, participants suggested developi[INVESTIGATOR_152260]: “Maybe…you could make it more accessible on your phone - like an app. That 
would be cool because, you know, most young adults have apps and cell phones”. The proposed iCanCope with Sickle Cell Pain intervention will build upon the CBT pain 
content of Web- MAP, while significantly tailoring the program for the SCD population 
(largely of African descent) and to add symptom and goal tracking and peer -based 
social support. iCanCope with Sickle Cell Pain  will also be delivered on an integrated 
smartphone and web- based platform, rather than the exclusively web- based format of 
Web-MAP.  
 
Development and Validation of “Sickle Cell Disease Pain Burden Interview -You

(SCPBI -Y) 
The SCPBI -Y is a brief, clinically relevant, multidimensional interview that has been 
validated to assess pain burden in youth aged 7- [ADDRESS_175418] of 
“pain burden” was defined to encompass pain, and its impact on physical function, social/community participation, and the emotional aspects of daily living. The SCPBI -Y 
was developed using a panel of field experts (physicians, nurses, psychologists, researchers), patients, and caregivers as well as review of existing functional assessment and pain impact tools in the literature. The validation study involved 129

youth recruited from the inpatient and outpatient clinics of 4 pediatric hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600]. The SCPBI -Y demonstrated strong internal consistency reliability (α=0.891; N=129), cross -
informant concordance (child- caregiver; n=40, r=0.78, p<0.001), and test -retest reliability 
(outpatient setting; n=47, r=0.80, p<0.001). Moderate construct validity was found with validated measures of functional ability, pain, and quality of life. These findings suggest 
that the SCPBI -Y scores are valid and reliable for evaluating pain burden in youth with 
SCD and  will be used to screen youth in the proposed study.  
 
Development and Validation of a Web- Bas
 ed Multi -Dimensional Pain Diary for Youth 
with SCD  
This study aimed to develop and establish the content validity of a web- based multi -
dimensional pain diary for young people with SCD and conduct an end- user review to 
refine the prototype. Diary items were adapted from the e- Ouch©, an electronic diary 
measure with evidence of content validity, construct validity and responsiveness in youth 
with arthritis.44–[ADDRESS_175419].  
 
“Teens Taking Charge: Managing Arthritis Online” Disease Self -Manage
 ment Program  
[CONTACT_152353], one of the study’s Co- PIs is currently completing a multi -center  RCT to 
evaluate the effectiveness of Teens Taking Charge: Managing Arthritis Online, a 12-
week multi -component web -based program consisting of disease education, self -
management strategies, and social support designed for youth with arthritis and their 
parents.[ADDRESS_175420] with telephone- based coaches 
(trained non- healthcare professionals). This program was developed and evaluated in 
English and French using a sequential phased approach, including iterative development, usability testing, and outcome evaluation. The current trial involves 324 
youth (12- 18 years) and one of their caregivers from 11 pediatric hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600]. 330 
participants were randomized to the intervention or attention- control group. We are 
completing outcome data on HRQL, arthritis symptoms, treatment adherence, 
knowledge, and self -efficacy from both groups at baseline (T1), immediately following 
the intervention (T2), and at 6 (T3) and 12 (T4) months. Our group is also completing an NIH-funded trial of a Spanish version of the Teens Taking Charge program (n=300), and 
have adapted the program to meet the self -management needs of youth with cancer 
(Funded by [CONTACT_152303]) and hemophilia (Canadian Hemophilia Society). All of these web-based interventions were built by [CONTACT_152304], the same team that will develop and ensure the sustainability of the iCanCope with Sickle Cell Pain  website.  
Needs Assessment to Inform Development of iCanCope with Sickle Cell Pain  Program  
This study aimed to qualitatively explore the perceived pain self -management needs of 
young people with SCD.
12 A descriptive qualitative design was used with a purposive 
sample of young people aged 12- 29 years with SCD (n=26), parents (n=5), and 
healthcare professionals (HCP; n=34). Our findings demonstrated that all young people 
had significant disease impact from SCD on their physical, emotional, role, and future functioning. Participants also described a lack of available resources to support disease

self-management, especially pain, and indicated that the proposed iCanCope with Sickle 
Cell Pain program could address this need (See Table 2). This is one of the first studies to explore the perceived pain self -management needs of youth with SCD with the goal of 
informing development of a web- and app- based self -management intervention for this 
population. We anticipate that this early involvement of youth, parents, and HCPs will 
help to ensure that the content and format of the intervention is relevant, acceptable, 
and meets the needs of this underserved group.   
    
2.3. Scientific or scholarly background:  
   
Poor Pain Self -management in Youth with Sickle Cell Disease   
Sickle cell disease (SCD) is the most common genetic blood disease in North America and 
primarily affects people of African descent.1 The hallmark feature of SCD is recurrent epi[INVESTIGATOR_152261]- occlusive crisis (VOC; blockage of red blood cells).1,[ADDRESS_175421] on all aspects of health- related quality of life (HRQL).3–[ADDRESS_175422] majority of SCD pain 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841] (90%) are treated in the home setting;10 unfortunately, many of these epi[INVESTIGATOR_152262].11,12,13 Self-management has been defined as “the individual’ s ability 
to manage the symptoms, treatment, physical, and psychological consequences and lifestyle 
changes inherent to living with a chronic illness”.[ADDRESS_175423] successful self -management 
interventions are rooted in the principles of cognitive- behavioral therapy (CBT).15 CBT involves 
normalization of the patient’s experience through education, training in strategies for managing 
disease- related symptoms and other stressors, enhancing self -efficacy, and guidance on 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_99609] a long- term self -management plan.16–[ADDRESS_175424] access to 
these services due to geographic restrictions (e.g., available only in tertiary centers), limited availability of trained clinicians to deliver the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], inaccessibility due to school and work 
schedules, as well as direct and indirect incurred costs if additional healthcare visits are used to 
provide this training.
21–23 Moreover, these therapi[INVESTIGATOR_152263], and are unsuitable for widespread distribution to community and home- based settings.

Rationale for Web and Mobile Technologies to Enhance Delivery of Pain Self -man agement Care 
Web and mobile technologies can be applied to enhance the accessibility of pain self -
management therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].25,26 In addition to improving access, these technologies can empower 
youth to take an active role in managing their condition by [CONTACT_1541] “in the moment” access to 
pain copi[INVESTIGATOR_4262].27 These technologies can therefore be leveraged together to build a

tailored self -management program for youth with SCD that emphasizes empowerment, involves 
parents, facilitates the creation and tracking of personalized goals, and offers peer -based social  
support. A media- rich website delivered on a desktop/laptop computer is ideal for teaching 
complex CBT -related skills using animations, illustrations, and videos. Smartphones are deeply 
integrated into the daily life habits of most youth,[ADDRESS_175425] decade.29–[ADDRESS_175426] 
consistent efficacy for symptom reduction, knowledge attainment, and improved health 
behaviors in individuals with painful and other chronic health conditions. In the field of chronic 
pain, there is emerging evidence from two recent systematic reviews in adults32,33 (e.g., [ADDRESS_175427] size of |0.285|; 95% confidence interval [CI]; |0.145 to 0.424|)33  and one in 
children/adolescents30 ([ADDRESS_175428] size of |0.41|; 95% CI; |0.74 to 0.07|) that 
self-guided treatments delivered over the Internet reduce pain intensity. However, there is little 
empi[INVESTIGATOR_152264]- based pain management interventions 
that target the unique developmental and disease- related needs of youth (aged 12 -18 years) 
with SCD.   
Systematic Reviews of Smartphone- Bas
 ed Interventions for Pain Management  
There are a growing number of smartphone- based pain self -management applications (“apps”) 
available for patients to download and use on their personal mobile devices. In 2014, we 
conducted a comprehensive scopi[INVESTIGATOR_152265] -management apps across the 
iPhone, Android, Windows, and BlackBerry stores.34 We identified 279 apps across stores with 
the majority (64%) designed for the Android platform. Pain self -care skill support was the most 
common self -management function (77.4%). Apps were also reported to provide pain education 
(45.9%), symptom self -monitoring (19%), social support (3.6%), and goal -setting (0.72%). No 
apps were comprehensive in terms of pain self -management content, with the majority of apps 
including only a single self -management function (58.5%). Other major limitations were noted: 
only 8.2% of apps included a healthcare professional in their development, patient engagement 
was limited, not a single app provided a theoretical rationale, and only 1 app underwent scientific 
evaluation.34   
Given that successful CBT requires strong patient engagement and consistent skills practice, it 
is critical that intervention content and design are relevant and appealing to end- users (i.e., 
youth with SCD and their families).[ADDRESS_175429] evidence- based 
apps to better support patients and families with accessible SCD pain self -management care.  
 
Existing Pain Self -Manage ment Programs for Youth with SCD Pain  
To our knowledge, there is only one technology -based program (used in research but not 
publicly available) that provides pain self -management support to youth with SCD. The 
effectiveness of this program has been evaluated via wait -list control RCT in a sample of 46 
youth (aged 8- 21 years) and their caregivers.36,37 The intervention involved a single session of 
in-person CBT training followed by 8 weeks of home- based practice using smartphones. In 
comparison to control, the primary study outcome of negative thinking in response to pain was 
unchanged.37 A major study limitation was that youth did not use the smartphone app frequently. 
On average, youth accessed the smartphone pain copi[INVESTIGATOR_152266] 12% of the total days that they had the device. The range of pain frequency reported by [CONTACT_152305] [mean of 15.2 pain days (SD 13.6) over 8 weeks] was relatively broad and thus some participants had relatively infreq uent pain. Overall, the smartphone- assisted copi[INVESTIGATOR_152267] 
25% of total pain days. Given this low usage, the authors identified a clear need for future

18,38– 40 To assess app comprehensiveness, the 
following functions were assessed: (a)  pain tracking, (b) ability to set goals related to improving 
pain and functioning, (c)  training in CBT -based pain self -management strategies, (d) social 
support, and (e) disease- specific education.  
Thus, while the one existing program36,37 for youth with SCD pain demonstrates the potential of 
using technology to promote pain copi[INVESTIGATOR_152268], it is limited  by: (a) very low patient usage, 
(b) lack of demonstrated effectiveness for improving clinical outcomes, (c) lack of personalized 
goal-setting to improve functional outcomes, (d) lack of social support component, and (e) lack 
of SCD education delivered on the app.  Importantly, this program also required an initial in-
person CBT training session, which presents barriers in terms of cost and accessibility to many patients. (See Table 1) There is currently no single technology -based program that provides 
comprehensive pain copi[INVESTIGATOR_152269].  
   
2.4. P
rior approvals:  
   
Currently participating sites received IRB approval, this is an extension of the approved study IRB #: STUDY00000693. Before beginning the referral process at any new sites, we will ensure that approvals have been obtained and we will maintain records of their approvals including all 
modifications.

4.2. Description and purpose of all drugs, devices  and biologics:  
   
The iCanCope with Pain is a smartphone app to help young people manage persistent pain. It is 
comprised of personalized goal setting to improve pain and function, CBT -based pain self -
management training and rehearsal, and peer -based social support through a closed online 
community for youth with SCD. The app provides users with reminder and positive feedback on 
their progress to reaching their goals.  The app will provide in- the-moment access to pain copi[INVESTIGATOR_152271], behavior, and pain. The app will also allow 
youth to track their symptoms in real- time and generate customized reports from their data to 
show clinicians. The parameters that will be tracked by [CONTACT_152307], pain impact, mood, and sleep. The app will use the diary input to push relevant advice to the user.

This study will be testing the initial effectiveness of the i CanCope app and website. These tools 
meet the definition of device because they intended to be used in the mitigation of disease. Per information found in the FDA published guidance for Mobile Medical Applications, this ‘device’ would be one for which the FDA would intend to exercise enforcement discretion - (meaning the 
FDA will not intend to enforce requirements under the FD&C Act and an IDE  will not be needed 
for the study) .

5. Procedures Involved  
5.1. Study design:[ADDRESS_175431] of iCanCope with Sickle Cell Pain  versus Attention Control 
Education will be conducted with 160 youth (age 12- 18) with SCD and their caregiver. The s ites 
will include Emory/CHOA, The Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_31331], and Connecticut Children’s Medical 
Center, University of Mississippi,  University of [LOCATION_012],  [LOCATION_011] Medical Center , Ann & Robert H. 
Lurie Children's Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7726], Nationwide Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], C.S. Mott Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_152272]’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. Participants will be randomized into one of two groups; 
experimental group or attention control group. The intervention phase will last 6- 8 weeks, with 
participants given a maximum of 12 weeks to complete the intervention content. This treatment period is based upon the typi[INVESTIGATOR_152273].
42,58 Outcome 
assessment will occur at baseline (T 1), immediately after completion of the intervention (2 
months; T 2), and repeated at [ADDRESS_175432] -intervention (T 3) to allow for assessment of 
maintenance of treatment gains as youth with SCD may have fluctuations in their disease course 
that influence pain outcomes . 
   
5.2. Research procedures:[ADDRESS_175433]- protected applications that will allow us to track user  engagement  (detailed 
user level and aggregate analytics). Youth will be encouraged to log onto the app (via push notifications) to track  their symptoms, develop and track functional goals, access copi[INVESTIGATOR_152274], and socially engage in the iCanCope community. Youth and their caregiver will also 
be encouraged to access the iCanCope  website, which will contain interactive SCD education 
and self -management strategies. The youth website will be organized into 6 core modules and 2 
optional ** modules, participants will complete one module per week (Table 3). Delivery of the 
optional modules will be based on response to the baseline measures. See Table [ADDRESS_175434] and

description of all study measures. Eligibility to receive the option insomnia module will be based on insomnia symptoms evaluated using two questions from the Adolescent Sleep Wake Scale (ASWS) assessing difficulty falling asleep ( “I have trouble going to sleep”) and difficulty 
maintaining sleep (“After waking up during the night, I have trouble going back to sleep”).  Adolescents responding “quite often,” “frequently, if not always,” or “always” to either of these will 
be judged to have symptoms of insomnia, and receive the module. Eligibility for the optional 
negative emotions module will be determined by [CONTACT_152308] 4- item PROMIS 
depressive symptoms scale, with a score of 9 or higher indicating eligibility to receive the 
optional module.  Eligibility for the optional modules will be sent via secure email to SickKids from 
Seattle Children’s.  Children’s staff will only indicate “yes” or “no” if they meet the criteria for the 
PROMIS and ASWS measures. There will also be content designed for caregivers to provide instruction in the best ways to support youth’s pain management skills and encourage adaptive 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_007], divided in to six modules (Table 3).  
 
**optional modules for this study are potentially two additional modules that would be given to yout
h only if they are randomized to Group A and if their baseline scores qualify them for one or 
both of them. This is not optional, but an addition to their modules, similarly to how branching 
logic works.  
 Ex
perimental Group Semi -Structured Interviews: Following the completion of the iCanCope with 
Sickle Cell Pain program , youth and parent participants will be invited to participate in a semi-
structured interview over the phone with the research staff from SCRI . The interviews  will be 
conducted any time between the post -treatment ( T2) and 6 month follow up assessment  (T3). All 
participants that are within the timeframe stated above will be asked to participate .The semi -
structured interview will allow participants to qualitatively comment on the intervention. The research staff will follow a semi -structured interview guide with questions pertaining to the ir 
experience using the iCanCope with Sickle Cell Pain website and app (see attached guides in 
supporting documents) . The interview will be audio- recorded and a research staff will transcribe 
the interview  verbatim.  The research staff will be trained on how to transcribe the interview and a 
different staff member will double check the transcription.  
 The semi -structured interviews will determine (i) participants’  acceptability of and level of 
engagement in the  iCanCope with Sickle Cell Pain program and (ii) their likes and dislikes of 
program, and improvement s on the program content and design . The research staff will verify 
transcripts against the tapes and field notes taken during the interviews will be transcribed and included in the analytic process . All data will be read by [CONTACT_152309]. This data will be used to refine the iCanCope with Sickle Cell Pain program for future trials.

10.3.  Number of screened subjects  versus the actual number  enrolled in the research:30 
   
Participants will be recruited from pediatric centers with SCD patient populations. The patient populations at these centers provide access to about 500 patients who are likely eligible for recruitment into this study based on proposed inclusion criteria. We anticipate a 30 -40% 
refusal rate based on our experience recruiting in this population.  
   
10.4.  Power analysis:  
   
Based on prior and current study experience, and the pool of available study candidates, we plan to enroll a total of [ADDRESS_175441]. With attrition conservatively estimated at 20% we expect a final sample size of 128. This proposed sample size is based on the following power calculation using preliminary data from investigator experience with prior pain trials and published trials in SCD:  
 
Calculations are based on expected differences in youth pain- related disability and pain 
intensity. Group sample sizes of 52 and 52 achieve 84% power to detect a difference of 1.0 in 
pain- related disability between the two treatment conditions, with three assessments, AR(1) 
covariance structure, SD=4, ICC=0.2, and alpha=0.05. If the difference is 1.5 between treatment arms, then 52 per group achieves 99% power with the same assumptions. For pain intensity, group sample sizes  of 49 and 49 achieve 80% power to detect a difference of 0.75 in 
pain intensity (average over three time points) in a design with 3 repeated measurements having a AR(1) covariance structure, SD=2, ICC=0.2 and 0.05 alpha.  
   
11. Withdrawal of Subjects  
11.1.  Anticipa ted circumstances under which subjects will be withdrawn from the research without 
their consent:  
   
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_152279] a family is not able to comply with study procedures or do not understand study instructions.  
   
11.2.  Procedures for orderly termination:  
   
If a participant must be withdrawn from all study procedures the study staff would contact [CONTACT_152312].  
   
11.3.  Procedures that will be followed when subjects withdraw from the research, including partial withdrawal from procedures with continued data collection  and withdrawal from data/specimen 
banking: 
   
Full Withdrawal : If a participant must be withdrawn from all study procedures the study staff 
would contact [CONTACT_152312].   
Partial Withdrawal : If
  a participant partially withdraws from the procedures, study staff would 
contact [CONTACT_152313]’s interest in participation. If the family is interested, the study procedures will be continued, if the family is not interested, this will be considered a full withdrawal.

distress. There is a potential risk of loss of confidentiality.  Some of the questionnaires include 
questions that could uncover depression or suicidal ideation. See below for plan.  
   
12.2.  Procedures with unforeseeable risks:  
   
There are no anticipated harms associated with participating in this study. Participants may get upset when talking about their pain from SCD. This risk will be discussed 
when consent is provided, and participants will be reminded that if they become upset  
at any time during the course of the study they can talk to the research assistant and 
their health care team (for example, nurse, social worker, or psychologist). Participants may be inconvenienced with the amount of time required to participate in the study (2 months + 6 month follow up).        
   
12.3.  Procedures with risks to an embryo or fetus should the subject be or become pregnant:  
   
N/A 
   
12.4.  Risks to others who are not subjects:  
   
N/A 
   
12.5.  Procedures performed to lessen the probability or magnitude of risks:  
   
Participants will be advised they can skip any questions they feel uncomfortable 
answering. To support confidentiality, adolescents will be asked to complete 
questionnaires independently. We will make every effort to protect this data. For example, all data will be coded with a unique ID number. Participants will be informed of their right to refuse to participate in any part of the data collection and given the phone numbers of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_152281]’s IRB in the event that they desire 
further information or would like to issue a formal complaint.  In the course of the study, 
we may become aware that participants are an imminent threat to themselves. The PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_5915] [ADDRESS_175442] information will be used when appropriate. 
Lower risk and less imminent cases are also reviewed by [CONTACT_152314]. 
All actions taken will be documented on a case report form and reported to the IRB.

Data analyses will be performed using SPSS v20.0 and SAS v9.3. Distributions of primary and secondary outcome variables at each time point (and on difference scores between time points) will be examined first with summary statistics and graphical tools. For outcome variables with highly skewed distributions, we will either apply transformation or non-parametric test procedures. Preliminary work will also involve computation of scale reliabilities 
(e.g., internal consistency using Cronbach’s alpha) of all of the self -report measures. The pi[INVESTIGATOR_152282] -to-treat analysis including all randomized subjects.  
 
Analytic plan  for Aim 1  
Feasibility will be determined by [CONTACT_152315], drop out, compliance, and missing data with 95% CI’s. Criteria for feasibility success will be based on previous studies by 
[CONTACT_27156]
39,72: accrual rates  >70%, attrition rates <20%, minimal technical difficulties (i.e., 
reported by <10%), high acceptability and satisfaction (item mean score of 4 on AES), 
adherence rates >80%, and minimal missed responses. In Aim 1, we will also determine preliminary efficacy of the intervention. To account for clustering due to repeated assessments within individuals, generalized estimating equations (GEE) will be used. Interaction terms will be used to compare the mean change from pre- treatment to post -treatment for the iC anCope 
group with the corresponding mean change for the Attention Control Education group. Single 
degree of freedom contrasts will test if there is a statistically significant change in pain and copi[INVESTIGATOR_152283]- treatment to immediate post -treatment for the  two groups separately; 
additional contrasts will be computed to test if there is a statistically significant mean change from baseline to the 6- month follow -up for each group. Secondary treatment outcomes 
(physical and emotional function, HRQL) w ill also be examined using GEE to test significant 
mean changes over time and between groups by [CONTACT_152316].  
Treatment fidelity will be assessed by [CONTACT_152317] (completers vs. non-completers) between and within groups using chi -squared tests and logistic regression 
models.  
 
 
Analytic Approach for Aim [ADDRESS_175444] of this hypothesis will follow the recommendations for testing “moderated mediation” models described by [CONTACT_73098], which 
permits specification of a single equation that furnishes the coefficients necessary for 
estimating total, direct, and indirect effects in a multilevel mediation model.
84 The single 
equation is made possible by [CONTACT_40397] a new outcome variable (“Z”) that comprises both the outcome variable of interest (“Y”) and mediating variable (“M”) simultaneously; the two are distinguished by [CONTACT_152318] (“S”) that take on the value of 0 and 1 depending on whether the new outcome variable “Z” represents the mediating variable or 
outcome variable.  The single model is then specified as:  
.  The model permits the estimation of 
the indirect effect (a
jbj) as a random effect, and by [CONTACT_152319] a linear 
function of a Level 2 variable (in this case, treatment group), it is possible to evaluate group 
differences in the proposed meditational model (i.e., “moderated mediation”).  The models  will 
be specified with “time” as a predictor (“X”) of the outcomes pain intensity and copi[INVESTIGATOR_152274], with the self -efficacy, self -management behaviors, goal- setting, and perceived 
social support  variables included as mediating variables (“M”). The indirect effect of time will 
then be specified to be predicted by [CONTACT_3148].  As such, this model will allow a test of whether

 To address Specific Aim 3, exploratory analysis will be used to examine possible moderators of effects of iCanCope with Sickle Cell Pain  including engagement with treatment, 
demographic factors (family income, age, sex), and disease characteristics (SCD pain burden).  To assess the moderation effect an interaction term will be included for each 
separate moderator variable and key predictor of interest (two- way interaction between 
moderator and group for cross -sectional analysis and three- way interaction between 
moderator, group and time for longitudinal analysis) in the regression models and test its significance using Wald t -test. 
   
14.2.  Quality control procedures  for collected data:
[ADDRESS_175446] protection and daily backup of data performed. The primary source of data will come from online assessments conducted on the REDCap website provided through ITHS at UW. 
REDCap has extensive security precautions appropriate for the storage of PHI. REDCap 
was developed specifically around HIPAA- Security guidelines and is recommended for 
use by [CONTACT_33365]. In 2010 the Institute of Translational Health Sciences Biomedical 
Informatics Core (ITHS BMI) began supporting an installation of REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture), which is software specifically designed for electronic data capture (EDC) for clinical trials. REDCap features include differentiated user roles and privileges, user authentication and authorization security, electronic signatures, SSL 
encryption, and comprehensive auditing to record and monitor access and data changes. 
PIs ca n configure REDCap User Rights and Data Access Groups to provide granular 
study data access to authorized study personnel. Access to servers is restricted to authorized ITHS BMI support personnel. The servers are located on ITHS -owned 
hardware in a secure server room at the University of Washington. This server room 
meets the technical requirements for HIPAA compliance and hosts other servers 
containing Protected Health Information (PHI). The Operating System of each server will be kept fully patched and firewalled in accordance with UW Medicine Information Security Policy. All identifying information will be removed from all electronic data, thus protecting the identities of participating families. Data will be kept for a minimum of seven years.  
 To ensure the accuracy of the data the following processes will be implemented:  
• The study coordinator will check all data from REDCap questionnaires for completeness.  
• REDCap will be exported directly to SPSS statistical software, to ensure the 
participant’s responses are accurately entered into the database used for 
analyses. This will be secure and stored locally at Seattle Children's.  
 
iCanCope Program- The Toronto site will be responsible for maintaining the study iCanCope 
smartphone app, which will be used for some online data entry by [CONTACT_19288]. The iCanCope app will be hosted at the Centre for Global eHealth Innovation at University Health Network (UHN). Data stored on the iCanCope server will be protected from data corruption as per policies of the UHN data center. Regular backups will be performed in order to prevent 
against unrecoverable corruption issues. All processes will be PHIPA compliant.

15.1.  Procedures to secure the data and/or specimens during storage, use, and transmission:  
   
All participant data will be coded with a unique identification number, thus ensuring the subject’s identity as a participant in this study will remain confidential. The research 
records will be kept confidential and protected health information will be safeguarded as 
required by [CONTACT_47255]’s IRB and HIPA A regulations. The research staff and Seattle 
Children’s IRB will be allowed to inspect the information collected from this study. Data collection online through REDCap will also be private and confidential. REDCap was 
developed specifically around HIPAA- Security guidelines and is recommended for use by 
[CONTACT_33365]. In 2010 the Institute of Translational Health Sciences Biomedical Informatics 
Core (ITHS BMI) began  supporting an installation of REDCap (Research Electronic Data 
Capture), which is software specifically designed for electronic data capture (EDC) for 
clinical trials. REDCap features include differentiated user roles and privileges, user authentication a nd authorization security, electronic signatures, SSL encryption, and 
comprehensive auditing to record and monitor access and data changes. PIs can configure REDCap User Rights and Data Access Groups to provide granular study data 
access to authorized study personnel. Access to servers is restricted to authorized ITHS 
BMI support personnel. The servers are located on ITHS -owned hardware in a secure 
server room at the University of Washington. This server room meets the technical requirements for HIPAA compliance and hosts other servers containing Protected Health Information (PHI). The Operating System of each server will be kept fully patched and firewalled in accordance with UW Medicine Information Security Policy.  
No personally identifying health information is stored in the app. Users are given unique login IDs and use nicknames as usernames in the app.  All participant data will be coded with a unique 
identification number, thus ensuring the subject’s identity as a participant in this study will remain confidential. The research records will be kept confidential and protected health information will 
be safeguarded as required by  [CONTACT_47255]’s IRB and HIPAA regulations.  The research staff

19. Recruitment Methods39 
19.1.  When, where, and how potential subjects will be recruited:  
   
At Emory/CHOA, The Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_31331], and Connecticut Children’s Medical Center , 
the potential subjects are recruited at their Sickle Cell clinics. Local study staff will mail a study 
introduction letter and follow up with a phone call. Study staff may also make an in- person 
clinic visit during the patients’ appointments. Once eligibility is confirmed and documented on 
the eligibility checklist, consent/assent will be obtained by a trained member of the research team. Consent/assent will preferably be obtained in person, or by [CONTACT_152326][INVESTIGATOR_307]. If the patient is not able to come to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_152284], the research staff will review the forms over the phone with the patient and provide instructions to send the signed consent form back either by [CONTACT_2319], fax, or SickKids secure file transfer. 
 
At Seattle and all other sites: Child participants will be receiving care from one of our study sites. Potential participants will be introduced to the study and given a flyer about the study by [CONTACT_30155]. If interested in being contact[INVESTIGATOR_530], their provider will send the potential participant’s contact [CONTACT_152327]’s. The potential 
participant will be contact[CONTACT_152328]’s to screen for eligibility. If 
eligible, consent forms will be emailed to participants and a consent call will be set up for a future time.  
 Additional participants will be identified via the websites and social media outlets (Facebook  
and Instagram) of sickle cell disease community organizations such as  These 
participants will be able to view a study flyer, and if they are interested in participating, they 
may fill out the referral form through REDCap with their contact [CONTACT_32431] a few 
preliminary eligibility questions . They may also contact  [CONTACT_152329]. SCRI  staff will then contact [CONTACT_152330]. If eligible, consent forms will be emailed to participants and a consent call will be set up for a future time.  
    
19.2.  Steps that will be taken to protect potential subjects’ privacy interests:
[ADDRESS_175449] information stored and transmitted 
securely through REDCap. 
   
19.3.  Sources of subjects:41    
Potential subjects will be identified by [CONTACT_152331]. Additional 
participants will be recruited from sickle cell disease  community organizations .

Potential participants will be introduced to the study and given a flyer about the study by [CONTACT_152332] . If interested in being contact[INVESTIGATOR_530], their provider will send the potential 
participant’s contact [CONTACT_152333]’s Research Institute study team using either a secure and direct fax line to the study staff or s ubmitting a REDCap form online  The 
contact [CONTACT_152334]’s using the referral form (see attached 
Referral Form document). Providers will only need to check Yes or No to the following 
eligibility criteria: age 12- 18 years, has pain from sickle cell disease, able to speak and read 
English, and has access to the Internet. Study staff at SCRI will then screen for further eligibility during a phone call with the potential participants.  Identifying potential subjects will 
rely on the identification by [CONTACT_13935]’ care providers.   
Potential participant s will also be able to contact [CONTACT_152335] . 
   
19.5.  Materials that will be used to recruit subjects:
[ADDRESS_175450] fax line, secure email or as a REDCap 
survey online.  
   
19.6.  Recruitment methods not controlled by [CONTACT_47255]’s:  
   
Emory/CHOA , The Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_31331],  and Connecticut Children’s Medical  Center have 
their local IRB approval to screen for eligibility and enroll participants . Local study investigators 
(Zempsky, Dampi[INVESTIGATOR_3694]/Bakshi, or Odame) will be contact[CONTACT_152336]. Initial patient contact [CONTACT_152337] (1) through a mailed 
letter signed by a clinic staff, followed up by a telephone call from study staff, or (2) in- person 
during scheduled clinic visits.   If parent/youths are interested in learning more, study staff will 
explain the study and go over the Sickle Cell Pain Burden Interview (in person or over the 
telephone), as this is not currently a standard of care clinical measure.  If they patient is not 
eligible, the results from the Sickle Cell Pain Burden Interview will not be used for the research study. We will only track how many patients did not meet the criteria, we will not store any data from the SCPBI.  See section 19.1 for further recruitment information for these sites.  These 
recruitment methods will only be used at the sites listed in the beginning and not Seattle or any other sites.  
   
20. Consent/Assent Process  
20.1.  Where the consent process will take place:  
   
At Emory/CHOA, The Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_31331],  and Connecticut Children’s Medical Center: 
Consent/assent will be obtained by a trained member of the research team. Consent/assent 
will preferably be obtained in person, or by [CONTACT_152326][INVESTIGATOR_307]. If the patient is not able to come to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_152284], the research staff will review the forms over the phone with the patient and provide instructions 
to send the signed consent form back either by [CONTACT_2319], fax, or SickKids secure file transfer . 
 
 At Seattle Children’s and other participating sites: Consent will take place over the phone, after the family has had sufficient time to decide whether they would like to participate.  We will 
go through the consent script with the parent and then the child and their electronic consent will be  obtained on REDCap.

5. Procedures for obtaining and documenting assent : 
   
Consent forms will be read and completed at the participants’ home, while speaking to a SCRI study coordinator on the phone.  This phone conference will be used to 
answer additional questions, further explain the study, and obtain consent. After 
going through the consent script, participants will be asked to indicate their consent and authorization on an electronic form.   During the consent script, the study coordinator will discuss information about study procedures, study risks, potential benefits, and the voluntary nature of the study. In 
addition, the study coordinator will assess how well potential participants understand 
the study through the types of questions raised during the discussion of the protocol. The study coordinator will use lay language when speaking with the participant (and parent). For participants under 18, the study coordinator will obtain consent of the parent first.  The study coordinator will document the day and time of consent in the participant database. The participant will then be asked to document their consent 
on a secure  electronic form via REDCap.  The process will take about [ADDRESS_175453] reached the age of majority to obtain

20.10.  Waiver or Alteration of Consent Process  
20.10.1.  Reasons  for requesting a waiver or alteration of informed consent :57 
   
We are requesting a waiver of consent for subjects who turn 18 whose private identifiable information is still being used (but are not actively participating). This study is minimal risk and without the waiver, the study could not be practicably 
conducted.  
   
20.10.2.  Consent Waiver/Alteration Criteria justifications :
58 
[IP_ADDRESS].  The research involves no more than minimal risk to the subjects  
because: 
   
The study procedures only include surveys and a web program. The anticipated risks in this research are less than those our participa nts 
would ordinarily encounter in daily life.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].  The waiver or alteration will not adversely affect the rights or welfare of the subjects  because:
[ADDRESS_175455] eligibility for insurance,  
employability, stigmatization; Their participation in the study would not alter or affect the subject’s care; Any publication or presentation of 
research results would be done in a manner that would never reveal an individual’s identity either directly or indirectly.  These participants 
would have already been assented to participate in the study and

impact their rights or welfare. Participants always have the option to contact [CONTACT_152339].  
   
[IP_ADDRESS].  The research could not practicably be carried out without the waiver or alteration because:
[ADDRESS_175457] ed, analyzed and/or  de-
identified.  Once subjects turn 18, the study team may be unable to get 
in contact [CONTACT_152340]. Due to the small scope of this project, it is 
important to retain all the data collected from all eligible patients for 
the results of the study to be meaningful.

21.1.  If consent will be documented in writing (check one) : 
☐  “SOP: Written Documentation of Consent (HRP- 091)” will be followed.  
☒  “SOP: Written Documentation of Consent (HRP- 0 91)” will not  be followed. 
 Process of documenting consent:[ADDRESS_175458] would present no more than minimal risk to the research subjects and involves no procedures for which written consent is required outside of the research context.

22.2. H
IPAA Waiver/Alteration Criteria: Explain why:  
22.2.1.  The use or disclosure of PHI involves no more than a m inimal risk to privacy  of 
individuals, based on, at least the presence of the following elements:  
 
22.2.
1.1. An adequate plan to protect the identifiers from improper use and disclosure:  
   
 
We will protect all identifiers by [CONTACT_152341] a subject’s PHI and ID number.  All identifying information will be stored in a secure database in 
a protected folder including the information of patients who were referred, but not enrolled in the study. These patients who were referred but did not enroll in the study will have a different ID so they are not 
approached after recruitment.  
    
[IP_ADDRESS].  An adequate plan to destroy identifiers at earliest opportunity consistent with conduct of research:  
   
All identifiers will be destroyed at the earliest opportunity consistent with conduct of this research This means that once all  analysis of identifiable 
data for the study is complete, all identifiers will be destroyed.  
   
[IP_ADDRESS].  Assurances that PHI will not be reused or disclosed to any other party or entity, except as required by [CONTACT_152342] e 
research:  
   
PHI will not be reused or disclosed to any other person or entity.  
   
22.2.2.  The research could not practicably be conducted without the waiver  or alteration  of 
authorization:  
   
Without the waiver  of authorization, study sites would not be able to obtain patient 
contact [CONTACT_152343]. The study would have limited eligible patients if patients were given the option to contact [CONTACT_152344]. Study staff would not be able to contact [CONTACT_152345]. Obtaining PHI is necessary for the characterization of the 
groups of the individuals who screen out of the study.  
Because we will not be seeing the participants in person, we are asking for an 
alteration  for online authorization. Without it, study time lines would be delayed and 
participant interest would decrease waiting for mailed consent forms. The participant will document their  consent  authorization  on a secure electronic form via REDCap. 
The study staff at SCRI will not have any in- person contact [CONTACT_152346].

[ADDRESS_175467]: Children.    
[ADDRESS_175468] also include, as applicable: (1) why direct benefits are anticipated, (2) why risks are justified by 
[CONTACT_47264]/or the relationship between risk and prospective benefit compared to available alternatives, (3) why risk represents only minor 
increase over minimal risk, (4) how study procedures are reasonably commensurate with those inherent to the child’s actual or expected conditions , (5) 
whether the interventions/procedures are likely to yield generalizable knowledge about the participant’s condition and why it  is of “vital importance” to 
understanding or amelioration of the participant’s underlying disorder or condition, and (6) an explanation of what alternative methods/approaches were considered to make the above assessments (as applicable).

30 i.e., numbers of subjects excluding screen failures.  
31 Payment for participation is not considered a benefit.  
32 For example, data will be double entered, data will be reviewed by [CONTACT_47265], etc.  
33 If your study is multis ite and there are differences in how confidentiality will be maintained by [CONTACT_47266], this s hould 
be explained in this section (e.g. local site will have samples that are linked to a person’s name, but the coordination center will only receive coded 
samples without any links).  Confidentiality regarding use of Social Media will be explained in a protocol section below.  
34 Applicable for studies that present more than minimal risk.  
35 Include information about who (describe in terms of role  or group) will review the data.  
36 This should be specific to the social media you are using for the research.  
37 All communications that are directed towards subjects and specific to a particular study will require prior IRB review and approva l.  All non -IRB 
reviewable communications can be described in general terms by [CONTACT_17203] – news stories, relevant publications – and representative examples of 
each can be provided.   
38 Applicable if the research involves more than minimal risk to subjects.  If minimal risk, this section is N/A.  
39 If this is a multicenter study and subjects will be recruited by [CONTACT_28585] (e.g., call centers, national  
advertisements) those methods should also be described here.  
40 “Privacy interest” refers to a person’s desire to place limits on whom they interact or whom they provide personal information.  
41 For example: medical records, CIS, clinical databases, other study records. If the study will access PHI for recruitment purposes without prior 
authorization from subjects, please address this in the HIPAA Authorization section below.  
42 Attach copi[INVESTIGATOR_47221]. For printed advertisements, attach the final copy. 
For online advertisements, attach the final screen shots (including any images).  When advertisements are taped for broadcast, send the final 
audio/video tape to [EMAIL_875] . You may attach the wording of the advertisement to the SmartForm prior to tapi[INVESTIGATOR_47222]- tapi [INVESTIGATOR_145527], provided the IRB reviews the final audio/video tape.

46 Note the Short Form Consent may only be used when certain conditions are met.  See HRP -091 for requirements for Short Form consent form use.  
47 Seattle Children’s IRB prohibits the exclusion of non- English speaking populations from research unless there is sufficient justification for the 
exclusion.  See Investigator Manual HRP -103 for more information.   
48 For research conducted in the state, review “SOP: Legally Authorized Representatives, Children, and Guardians (HRP -013)” to be aware of which 
individuals in the state meet the definition of “children.”  The age of majority in Washington is 18; however, sometimes younger children have ability to consent for certain types of care (e.g. sexual reproduction/health; mental health; drug/alcohol treatment).  For research conducted outside of the state, 
provide information that describes which persons have not attained the legal age for consent to treatments or procedures involved the research, under 
the applicable law of the jurisdiction in which research will be conducted. One method of obtaining this information is to have a legal counsel or authority review your protocol along the definition of “children” in “SOP: Legally Authorized Representatives, Children, and G uardians (HRP -013).”  If 
the sites in other states in the study are conducting their own IRB review, you do not need to worry about this --type N/A.  If you are conducting 
research and are actively recruiting participants outside of Washington who are NOT c oming to SCH to give consent and who will be covered under 
SCH IRB approval, this section should be addressed in your protocol.  
[ADDRESS_175477] of benefit, the IRB generally requires one parent to provide 
permission for the child to participate.  
50 If parental permission will not be obtained, please address this in the Waiver or Alteration of Consent Process below.  
51 See HRP -013 for more information.  
52 The IRB generally follows the following guidelines for written assent: children 7- 12 should provide written assent on the “simple” assent form (HRP -
502G); children 13- 17 should provide written assent by [CONTACT_3252] -signing the parental permission form (HRP -502A).  The IRB will consider other assent 
scenarios (e.g. verbal assent for some or all children; not requiring assent for some or all children; or waiving assent): pl ease provide details about the 
plan for your study.  See HRP -090 and HRP -416 for more information on waiving assent and when assent is not necessary.  
53 See Appendix A -13 of the Investigator Manual HRP -103 for requirements for re- consent at age 18.  If you think  you meet the conditions for a waiver 
at 18, please address this in the Waiver or Alteration of Consent Process below.  
54 See “HRP -417 Cognitively Impaired Adults” for further information.   
55 For example: durable power of attorney for health care, court appointed guardian for health care decisions, spouse, and adult  child.  If you are 
following HRP -013 in order to make this determination, simply state that in this section. For research conducted in the state, review “SOP: Legally 
Authorized Representatives, Children, and Guardians (HRP -013)” to be aware of which individuals in the state meet the definition of  “legally authorized 
representative.” For research conducted outside of the state, provide information that describes which individuals are authorized under applicable law to consent on behalf of a prospective subject to their participation in the procedure(s) involved in this research. One method of obtaining this

Authorized Representatives, Children, and Guardians (HRP -013).”  If the sites in other states in the study are conducting their own IRB review, you do 
not need to worry about this --type N/A.  If you are conducting research and are actively recruiting participants outside of Washington who are NOT 
coming to Washington to give consent and who will be covered under SCH IRB approval, this section should be addressed in your protocol.  
56 The IRB may allow the person obtaining assent to document assent on the consent document.  
57 For example: consent/parental permission will not be obtained, required information will not be disclosed, the research involves deception, waiver for 
participants who turn 18, waiver for information collected about a non -present parent, or other waivers as necessary.  
58 The IRB needs to make all the waiver findings and key to this determination is that the IRB understand why it is not practicable to do the research 
without a waiver of consent.  You need to provide a rationale in order for the IRB to consider whether the waiver criteria are met. See “HRP -410: 
Waiver or Alteration of the Consent Process” for further information.   
59 Possible reasons might include: a) you are not collecting information that could put subjects or their families at harm, e.g., affect eligibility for 
insurance, employability, stigmatization; b) you are not collecting information that would alter or affect the subject’s care; c) any publication or 
presentation of research results would be done in a manner that would never reveal an individual’s identity either directly o r indirectly.  
60 Possible reasons could be: a) inability to locate families because of the lengthy time period over which the records/samples were created; b) many of 
the subjects whose records, data, or specimens will be used may have died and contact[CONTACT_152352] d cause harm and 
anguish to families; c) all eligible patients must be included in the study for the results to be meaningful.

75 Provide enough information to convince the IRB that  the principal and/or co -investigator(s) are appropriately qualified to conduct and supervise the 
proposed research. When applicable, describe their prior clinical experience with the test article or study -related procedures, or describe their 
knowledg e of the local study sites, culture, and society.  
76 For example, as appropriate: (1) Justify the feasibility of recruiting the required number of suitable subjects within the agreed recruitment period. For 
example, how many potential subjects do you have access to? What percentage of those potential subjects do you need to recruit? (2) Describe the time that you will devote to conducting and completing the research. (3) Describe the facilities in which the research will be conducted. (4) Describe the availability of medical or psychological resources that subjects might need as a result of an anticipated consequences of the human research. (5) 
Describe your process to ensure that all persons assisting with the research are adequately informed about the protocol, the research procedures, and their duties and functions.

 14 1.0 INTRODUCTION  
1.1 Background  
The use of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in HIV -infected patients is a shining success in medicine. 
These medications allow millions  of patients to survive for decades, whereas untreated  infection is 
often fatal within ten years. Widespread implementation of ART has also decreased HIV transmission 
because aviremic infected persons have little to no transmission potential. [ADDRESS_924094]  more  infected persons to seek early HIV testing and management.  Widespread implement ation 
of HIV cure would then decrease both HIV prevalence and incidence. 4 The scalability of each HIV 
cure approach  will depend on its effectiveness, but also on its tolerability and affordability. Notably, 
many current HIV cure ideas involve treatments that are not y et widely used in the clinic. 5 “Off the 
shelf” medications that require no further research and development expenditure, and have well 
established toxicity profiles, are therefore attractive potential options for HIV cure.  
The major barrier to HIV er adication is the HIV reservoir.  The reservoir consists predominately of 
memory CD4 + T cell s, which harbor non -replicating HIV DNA that is integrated into chromosomal 
DNA. Complete elimination of these cells, or  at least  inactivation of the “silent” HIV wit hin these cells, 
is required for cure. The total reservoir typi[INVESTIGATOR_682356] 1 -10 million CD4 + T cells. 6-8 
On a per cell basis, the rate of reactivation of HIV is extraordinari ly low. Yet , antiretroviral  treatment 
interruption (ATI) studies demonstrate that HIV will reactivate approximately once per week. 9,[ADDRESS_924095] quantitative viral outgrowth 
assay (QVOA ) is specific for replication competent HIV but is laborious, slow and requires a large 
number of CD4 + T cells, making it less feasible for repeat monitoring. [ADDRESS_924096] ( GALT ) and lymph nodes: 
this adds to the challenge of quantitating latently HIV infected cells.   
Numerous technologies are being evaluated to eradicate the HIV reservoir. A majority of potential 
interventions are in preclinical development. Examples include gene therapy delivery  of HIV DNA 
editing enzymes, chimeric antigen T cell therapy (CAR T cells), therapeutic vaccines, delivery of HIV 
Clinical Protocol

reversing agents ( LRAs ) are being actively tested in hum an study participants. [ADDRESS_924097] assume d that after suppressive ART of >[ADDRESS_924098] formula in finance 
and characterizes the slow clearance of the HIV reservoir over many decades. Two papers estimate 
the reservoir clearance half -life to be 44 months, 6,7 which means that it would take over 60 years for 
the reservoi r to be cleared with ART alone.    
On suppressive ART, t he latent reservoir clearance rate consists of  the sum of three latent cell 
processes: proliferation, death  and re activation  to active viral replication. Importantly, o bserved per 
cell proliferation ra tes are several orders of magnitude higher than reactivation rates .27 We identified 
in the literature that cells composing  the reservoir, including effector memory  (TEM), central memory  
(TCM), naïve (TN) and stem cell like (TSCM) memory CD4 + T cells, proliferate  at rates similar  to 
comparable cells without HIV integration. 26,28-[ADDRESS_924099] (>60% inhibition) on T cells in vitro  in [ADDRESS_924100] been possible.  
While MMF has been used in HIV + patients receiving organ and blood transplants, findings under 
these con ditions indicate multiple confounders in transplantation settings, 35-[ADDRESS_924101] of MMF.  
1.3  Study drug  
Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) is a prodrug of mycophenolic acid, which inhibits an enzyme required 
for proliferation of lym phocytes, including B and T cells. MMF is used to prevent organ rejection 
following lung, liver, heart and kidney organ transplantation. Moreover, MMF is commonly used as a 
steroid -sparing agent for autoimmune diseases.  
MMF safety in HIV -infected patients  has been established in over 300 HIV + solid organ transplant 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_682357]. 39-59 Fewer than 10% of treated participants developed nausea. 
Renal toxicity, cytopenia, opportunistic infections or decrease in peripheral CD4 + T cell counts were 
not noted. 39-45,49 Of note, we will use 500mg twice daily in our study, which is lower than the 2 -3g/day 
to prevent organ rejection. We will increase to [ADDRESS_924102] is not noted on a lower dose.  
Myfortic©  is an enteric coated version of the MMF which is associated with less nausea, vomiting and 
diarrhea.  Myfortic©  will be used for participants who have refractory nausea, vomiting and / or 
diarrhea on MMF, and who wish to remain in the study.  
 
2.0 STUDY HYPOTHESES AND OBJECTIVES  
2.1 Hypotheses  
2.1a MMF or Myfortic©  will be well  tolerated and will not decrease adherence to or antiviral 
efficacy of ART.  
2.1b Peripheral CD4 + T-cell counts and percentages will not meaningfully decrease during 
treatment with MMF or Myfortic©  and ART . 
2.1c There will be no excess risk of opportunistic infections in MMF or Myfortic©  treated 
study participants.  
2.1d MMF  or Myfortic©   therapy will lead to a progressive decrease in reservoir size over 22 
months  of treatment.  
Clinical Protocol     
 17 2.1e MMF  or Myfortic©   therapy will lead to a continual shift in HIV reservoir composition 
from primarily effector memory CD4 + T-cells (T em) and central memory CD4 + T-cells 
(Tcm), to primarily stem cell like memory (T scm) and naïve (T n) CD4 + T-cells.  
2.1f MMF or Myfortic©  will eliminate detectable measures of the HIV reservoir, including  cell-
associated DNA/mRNA , and quantitative viral outgrowth.   
2.1g MMF or Myfort ic© will not decrease the humoral immune response to routine annual 
influenza vaccination.  
 
2.2 Primary Outcome s 
2.2a Change in cell -associated HIV DNA (ca -DNA) reservoir size as measured by 
[CONTACT_682370]©  
(historical controls).  
2.2b Change in HIV replication by [CONTACT_682371] (scVL) in study participants on 
versus off MMF or Myfortic©   (historical controls).  
2.3c Change of viral reactivation by [CONTACT_79371] -associated HIV mRNA in study participants on 
versus off MMF or Myfortic©   (historical controls).  
2.3d Change of the inducible HIV reservoir size by [CONTACT_597008] (QVOA)  
in study participants on vers us off MMF or Myfortic©   (historical controls).  
2.3d Change of  the cellular composition of the HIV DNA reservoir in study participants on 
versus off MMF or Myfortic©   (historical controls).  
 
2.3 Secondary  Outcomes  
2.3a CD4 + T cell numbers that recently emigrated from the thymus  
2.3b Blood CD4 + T cell count  
2.3c Complete blood cell count, comprehensive metabolic panel

3.[ADDRESS_924103] been on ≥[ADDRESS_924104] 22 months  with 
safety labs  and serial measure ment s of the HIV reservoir  (specifi cally, cell -associated HIV DNA and 
mRNA  (ca-DNA & ca -RNA ), quantitative viral outgrowth assay (QVOA ), and single copy plasma viral 
Clinical Protocol     
 18 load ( scVL )). A “go/no-go” decision  will occur after 12 months based on pre-defined threshold s of 
reduction in the HIV reserv oir measured with ca -DNA .  
All participants will be offered enrollment  in a sub -study in which an anoscopy with rectum biopsies  is 
performed on 3  occasions to assess the reservoir in the gastrointestinal lymphat ic tissue ( GALT  
We will vaccinate study parti cipants with the annual influenza vaccine and analyze their humoral 
response to this vaccine approximately one month later with a routine blood draw done in conjunction 
with a safety labs blood draw.  
We hypothesize tha t low d oses of MMF will be well tolerated among healthy HIV -infected study 
participants who have fully ART -suppressed HIV.  We hypothesize that the incidence of opportunistic 
infections will not excee d that of comparable larger cohorts of HIV -treated patients. Of note, certain 
opportunistic infections such as herpes zoster or HSV -2 recurrence continue to occur despi[INVESTIGATOR_682358], while pneumocystis pneumonia, CMV end organ disease, cryptococcus and many 
other opportunistic infections are much less common in th is context. Therefore, in the event of an 
infection, we will confer with the data safety management (DSM) panel to discuss whether this event 
is directly attributable to MMF. Finally, w e hypothesize that peripheral blood CD4 + and CD8 + T cell 
counts  will re main unchanged throughout  MMF therapy , and that HIV replication will remain controlled 
on ART  with addition of MMF.   
We hypothesize at least a 0.25-log reduction in cell -associated HIV DNA at one -year intervals in 
study participants who have a demonstrate d anti -proliferative re sponse to MMF treatment . We 
hypothesize that cell -associated HIV DNA will un dergo a shift from predominant  residence  in T CM and 
TEM to predominant  residence  in T N and T SCM.  In regards to our sub -study , we predict that reservoir 
depletion will occur with equivalent rates in blood and GALT.

6.0 PARTICIPANT  MANAGEMENT  
6.1  Procedures  
Participants in this study will  take 500 mg MMF once per day for one week as a lead in to limit drug -
related side effects. Provided they are tolerating the drug at lower dose, they will then initiate 500 mg 
MMF twice a day for 22 months  in addition to their regular anti -HIV treatment . MMF will be switched 
to Myfortic © in the event of poorly tolerated nausea, vomiting or diarrhea and participant agreement 
to remain in the study.  As described above, dose escalation to [ADDRESS_924112]. Participant s will  visit the clinic and provide 
samples (blood and  optional  rectal biopsies) several times during the course of the study . If feeling 
nausea or vomiting, participants will be offered ondansetron 4mg oral tablets .  The specific 
procedures for the stu dy visits are outlined below.  
Eligibility  Visit (approximately 2 hours)  
Clinical Protocol     
 22 During this visit , we will do the following:  
1) Provide participants with general information about the [ADDRESS_924113] Clinic  
2) Ask participants  to sign th e Study Consent Form, the Release of Medica l Information Form, 
and HIPAA Authorization Form  
3) Document that participants  have HIV by [CONTACT_682375] a medical condition that would preclude them  from entering the study. In the event that 
documentation is unavail able, we will ask participants  to allow us to do these tests after 
counseling and obtaining their verbal consent  
4) Take a medical and medication history  
5) Assess substance use history, including alcohol, and sexual risk behavior  
6) Perform a general clinical exam  (including vital signs: weight, height, blood pressure, pulse 
and temperature)  
7) Obtain a urine specimen for pregnancy testing in female participants  
8) Draw about 5 teaspoons  of blood for routine blood tests (blood cell counts and signs of 
anemia, kidney or liver dysfunction)  
9) Perform blood testing for hepatitis B and C if results are not already available from within 12 
months prior to eligibility visit.  
 
Entry  Visit (approxi mately 1 hour)  / Step 1 Lead -in 
If the information obtained at the eligibility visit indicates that a participant is  eligible to participate in 
the study, we will ask them  to come to the clinic for an entry visit. The purpose of this visit will be to 
enrol l the participant  in the study and o btain additional blood samples. We will ask all participants to 
take MMF for one week following this visit.  
During this visit, we will do the following:  
1) Draw 211 mL (43 teaspoons) of blood  
2) Perform follow up urine pregnancy testing in female participants  
3) Provide the study drug (MMF 500 mg daily) and instructions on how to use it . 
4) Schedule follow -up visits  
5) Answer any questions  
6) Focused physical exam as needed  
One-Week Visit (approximately 30 minutes)  / Step 2a Lead -in 
Six days after enrolling in the study, we will ask participants  to make a follow -up visit  to discuss 
tolerability of the drug. Participants will be seen in the morning of day 7. If they are tolerating the 
dose, then their dose will be increased to MMF 500 mg twice daily.   
 At this  visit, we will:  
1) Draw a combined total of 10.5  mL of blood (about 2 teaspoon s). 
Clinical Protocol     
 23 2) Ask the participant  how they are tolerating the study medication  
3) Answer any questions  
4) Focused physical exam as needed  
Two-Week Visit (approximately 30 minutes)  
Thirteen days after enrolling in the study, we will ask participants  to make a follow -up visit  to measure 
anti-proliferative effect at trough and peak MMF levels. Participants will be seen i n the morning of day 
14, approximately [ADDRESS_924114] at peak MMF levels. At this  visit, we will:  
5) Draw a combined total of 46.5  mL of blood (about 9 teaspoon s) on 2 occasions sep arated by 1 
hour.   
6) Ask the participant  how they are tolerating the study medication  
7) Answer any questions  
8) Focused physical exam as needed  
 
Three -Week Visit (approximately 30 minutes)  
 
The purpose of this visit is to determine how the participant  is responding to the study drug. Based on 
the results of the peak MMF time point studies done in the lab, we will determine whether the 
participant  is eligible to continue participating in the study  at the current dose for 22 months (Step 3 / 
Enrollment) or might require a dose escalation (Step 2b / lead -in).  
 
If a participant do es not have the desired anti -proliferative effect to MMF 500 mg twice daily  at the 
two-week visit, we will administer MMF 750 mg po twice daily  (Step 2b / lead -in): this will occur at the 
three -week visit because it takes approximately one week for the anti -proliferative assay to be 
performed.  
 
No blood will be drawn at the three -week visit.  
 
Four -Week Visit (approximately 3 0 minutes)  
 
For participants on [ADDRESS_924115] at peak MMF levels. At this  visit, we will:  
1) Draw a combined total of 157.5  mL of blood (about 11 teaspoon s) on 2 occasions separated 
by 1 hour .   
2) Ask the participant  how they are tolerating the study medication  
Clinical Protocol     
 24 3) Answer any questions  
4) Focused physical exam as needed  
 
Five-Week Visit (approximately 30 minutes) : only for participants receiving 750 mg po bid  
 
The purpose of this visit is to determine how participants who required e scalation to 750 mg bid are  
responding to the study drug. Based on the results of the peak MMF time point studies done in the 
lab on the week 4 visit , we will determine whether the participant  is eligible to continue participating in 
the study  at the curre nt dose for 22 months (Step 3 / Enrollment).   
 
If participant s do not have the desired ant i-proliferative effect to MMF [ADDRESS_924116] week on MMF 500 mg daily, we 
will offer the participant a change from MMF 500 mg daily to Myfortic © 360 mg daily. Myfortic © is an 
enteric coated version of MMF which is associated with less nausea and diarrhea in certain patients.  
If the participant tolerates the first week of Myfortic © 360 mg daily, then we will switch to Myfortic © 
[ADDRESS_924117] per protocol .  
 
In the case of refractory nausea or diarrhea  after week one , participants  will be offered a change from 
MMF 500 mg twice daily to Myfortic © 360 mg twice daily. If a study participant is on MMF 750 mg 
twice daily, then we will switch to Myfortic © [ADDRESS_924118] the 
option of withdrawing  their participation from the trial  rather than switching to Myfortic ©. 
 
Follow -up Visits (approximate ly 30 minutes)  
Over the course of the study, we will ask participants to come in 19  more times  (Table 2) . Starting at 
entry, f or the first month, we  will ask them  to come in weekly, then every other week for two months, 
then every month for the rest of the first [ADDRESS_924119] already received 
this vaccine in the community.  
During these visits, we will do the following:  
Clinical Protocol     
 25 1) Draw between 6.5 and 2 55 mL of blood depending on visit (Table 2) .  
2) Draw 2 sets of blood separated by [CONTACT_682376] (weeks, 12, 
24, 48, 74 & 88).  
3) Perform follow up urine pregnancy testing in female participants (point -of-care-test in the clinic)  
4) Ask how the participant  is tolerating the study medication  
5) Answer any questions  
6) Discuss continuation in the study  
7) Perform a focused physical exam as needed  
Optional Rectal Biopsy Visit (up to 2 hours)  
We will give all participants the option of providing rectal biopsy samples once before starting the 
study medication , once at [ADDRESS_924120] their 
prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT) and platelet  counts evaluated.  
Storage of Data and Leftover Samples for Use in Future Research  
Participant s will be asked for permission to keep data and any remaining samples for possible use in 
future research studies.  Residual samples w ill be stored indefinitely at the University of WA and/or 
Fred Hutch .  Before conducting additional research unrelated to the original research questions, the 
UW HSD will review the request.   
Specimens may be shared with other investigators at the UW, Fred Hutch or other institutio ns.  The 
samples may not be sold or used directly for production of any commercial product. Tests may 
include genetic research .  Each sample will be encoded (labeled) only with a barcode and a unique 
tracking number to protect participant’s confidentiality . 
There are no benefits to participants in the collection, storage, and subsequent research use of 
samples.  Reports about future research done with a participant’s samples will not be kept in their 
health records. A participant’s decision can change at any time up to the point the samples are 
released for research use by [CONTACT_401669].  However, if a participant consents 
to future use and some of their sample has already been used for research purposes, the information 
from that research may still be used.  Participants may also withdraw their permission by [CONTACT_682377].    
 
6. [ADDRESS_924121] them after 
delivery to get information about their pregnancy outcome. Pregnant participants will be linked to care 
appropriate for pregnant women with HIV infection.  
Participants will be closely monitored in a standardized fashion for potential toxicities and adverse 
events . Safety labs, including complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, plasma  HIV 
RNA concentrations and CD4 T  cell counts will be monitored frequently as indicated in Figure 1  and 
Table 2. 
The Division of AIDS Table for Grading the Severity of Adult Adverse Events (DAIDS AE Grading 
Table), Version 1.0, dated December 2004, Clarification August 2009, will be used for screening 
eligibility and for grading toxicities and is available at http://rsc.tech -
res.com/safetyandpharmacovigilance.  Alternate explanations for clinical or laboratory abnormalities 
that may at first appear to be related to the study agent must be explored.  
Management of adverse experiences  will be according to the best clinical practice and the judgment 
of the site investigator. Participants with Grade [ADDRESS_924122] that is abnormal repea ted, preferably within 72 hours. Laboratory 
norms will be the institutional values of the lab performing the tests. Abnormal clinical and laboratory 
findings will be followed until resolution to <  Grade 2 or baseline.  
• Grade 1 – Continue study drug; routine  monitoring.  
Grade 2 – Continue study drug; monitor closely with more frequent visits when clinically 
indicated.  
Grade 3 – Continue study drug while awaiting confirmatory results unless the clinician believes 
that remaining on study drug would be unsafe. In this case, proceed as below.  
• Confirmed Grade 3 events – Study drug should be discontinued until resolution to  Grade 2, 
unless the site investigator has compelling evidence that the toxicity is definitely NOT related 
to study drug. The event must be di scussed with Dr s. Schiffer and Harrington and then must 
be reviewed weekly until the toxicity resolves to ≤  Grade 2. If the event is possibly, probably, or 
definitely related to study drug but resolves to ≤  Grade 2 in less than 7 days , study drug can be 
restarted. If the toxicity worsens over the next 7 days or does not resolve to ≤ Grade [ADDRESS_924123] be permanently discontinued. If the toxicity recurs or evolves to ≥ 
Grade 3, the study regimen must be permanently discontinued.  
• Grade 4 (even before confirming) – The study drug must be discontinued  unless the site 
investigator has compelling evidence that the event is not due to study drug. Drs. Schiffer and 
Harrington,  and the DSM panel, must be promptly notified of all Grade 4 events. Study drug 
will be permanently discontinued in the event of an adverse event ≥ Grade  [ADDRESS_924124] weekly until resolution of the 
adverse event to ≤  Grade 2 or until stabilized and no longer in need of such frequent 
monitoring, as determined by [CONTACT_6962].  
 
6.3 Reporting Requirements  
Clinical Protocol     
 27 Grade 2 events  should be recorded on CRFs  at each visit and will be assessed for relationship to 
study drug.  
 
Grade 3 or 4 events  
• Subjects should have abnormal laboratory tests repeated as soon as possible, preferably 
within 72 hours (to determine if the result was spurious).  
• [CONTACT_682386] and [CONTACT_586322]  must be notified of confirmed ≥ Grade 3 adverse events with in 
24 hours, if they are possibly, probably or definitely related to the study.  
• The sponsor (American Foundation for AIDS Research or amfAR) will be notified of ≥ Grade 3 
adverse events  within one  week , if they are possibly, probably or definitely related to the study.    
 
6.4 Criteria for Treatment  and Individual Study Participant  Discontinuation  
• The subject requires treatment with disallowed medications  
• Pregnancy  
• Nausea, vomiting or diarrhea refr actory to anti -emetic medications  
• Drug toxicity that requires permanent study drug discontinuation as defined in Section 6.2.  
• If a participant does not plan to continue with the study  
• Go / no -go criteri on at month 12: participants must have at least a 0.25 log reduction from baseline at 
12 months to continue on MMF. If th is criteri on is not met, participants will continue to be followed off 
study drug .  
• Subject stops their antiretroviral therapy regimen fo r greater than 2 weeks  
• The subject refuses further treatment and/or follow -up evaluations and decides to discontinue 
participation in the study  
• The investigator determines that further participation would be detrimental to the subject’s 
health or well -being 
• The subject experiences virologic failure. Virologic failure will be managed according to local 
guidelines. In this study, virologic failure is defined as plasma HIV RNA ≥ 1,000 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL 
(confirmed by [CONTACT_682378] 2 nd aliquot of the same speci men) .  If a participant has a viral load 
between 500 -1000 HIV RNA copi[INVESTIGATOR_014], then we will call the participants for an immediate recheck of their 
viral load as soon as possible and will continue to do so, until this value normalizes or meets criteria for 
virologic failure. Of note, viral load may be checked by [CONTACT_2299]’s primary care provider outside of 
the study: these values will be available to the study PI [INVESTIGATOR_682359].  
• The subject fails to comply with the study requirements so as to cause harm to him/herself or 
seriously interfere with the validity of the study results  
 
6.5 Criteria for Study Discontinuation  
Clinical Protocol     
 28 • The study is cancelled at the discretion of the IRB, DSMB and / or study PIs . This decision will 
be based on several possible factors including mild -moderate adverse effects in multiple 
participants, a severe adverse reaction in a single participant, and / or lack of [ADDRESS_924125] results.   
 
6.7 Replacement of Study Subjects  
• All participants are strongly encouraged to attend all study visit dates, however if a participant misses 
an appointment they will be contact[CONTACT_682379] -schedule the appointment or request being 
discharged from the st udy. If a participant misses 3 consecutive visits, they will be considered “lost -to-
follow -up”. 
• Replacement of participants. Considerable effort will be invested in maintaining participants in the 
study. New enrollee replaces a participant when a participa nt: 
o discontinue s during the first six months of the study  
o is lost to follow -up during the first three months of the study  
o is unable to tolerate either MMF or Myfortic © during the lead-in phase of the study  
(Steps 1, 2a & 2b)  
o does not develop an adequate anti -proliferative effect on MMF or Myfortic © during the 
lead-in phase (Steps 2a & 2b)  
 
7.0 EXPEDITED ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING  
Requirements, definitions and methods for expedited reporting of Adverse Events are outlined in 
Version 2.0 of the NIH DAIDS EAE Manual, which is available on the RSC website at http://rsc.tech -
res.com/safetyandpharmacovigilance/ . 
Since this is not an NIH -sponsored trial, ≥ Grade 3 adverse events will be reported to the sponsor, the 
American Foundation for AIDS Research (amfAR), within one week , if they are possibly, probably or 
definitely related to the study.    
 
8.[ADDRESS_924126] serial measurements of their HIV DNA reservoir  using various 
assays.  In order to remain enrolled in the MMF treatment arm of the study, partici pants will be 
required to show sequential  0.25 log  reduction s in the HIV reservoir at month 12 . We will also include 
a sub -study in which participants undergo  an anoscop y to measure the HIV reservoir in tissue rather 
than blood.  
8.2 Statistical o utcome s 
8.2.1 Main statistical outcome  
• Change in cell -associated HIV DN A (ca -DNA) reservoir size as measured by 
[CONTACT_682380] (historical 
controls).  
8.2.2 Secondary statistical outcomes  
• Change in HIV replication by [CONTACT_682371] (scVL) in study participants on  
versus off MMF (historical controls).  
• Change of viral reactivation by [CONTACT_79371] -associated HIV mRNA in study participants on 
versus off MMF (historical controls).  
• Change of the inducible HIV reservoir size by [CONTACT_597008] (QVOA)  
in stud y participants on versus off MMF (historical controls).  
• Change of  the cellular composition of the HIV DNA reservoir in study participants on 
versus off MMF (historical controls).  
• CD4 + T cell numbers that recently emigrated from the thymus  
• Blood CD4 + T cell count  
• Complete blood cell count, comprehensive metabolic panel  
• Incidence of opportunistic infection  
• Antibody response to annual influenza vaccination  
8.2.[ADDRESS_924127] that each assay has limitations in terms of 
sensitivity and specificity, as well as blood volume required for the assay. Safety labs and clinical 
measures such as CD4 + T cell count and HIV plasma RNA are inclu ded as secondary outcomes to 
allow us to assess the safety of the addition of MMF to ART.  
 
8.[ADDRESS_924128] been on ≥ [ADDRESS_924129] for the HIV 
cure field, and that funding is not available to support a control group. Nevertheless, our proposed 
study design is adequately powered to demonstrate statistical significance if MMF performs in 
accordance with predictions from our mathematical model. The rate of reservoir reduction on 
suppressive ART (no MMF) in a study by S iliciano et al was 0.0068 log 10 infectious u nits per million 
(IUPM ) resting CD4 + T cells per month  (95% CI  for the mean rate : 0.0026 - 0.0110 ; standard 
deviation : 0.017 ; annualized standard deviation 0.2) .6 Similarly , Crooks described a rate of reservoir 
reduction on ART of 0.0072 log 10 IUPM p er month  (95% CI  for the mean rate : 0.0031 - 0.0108) .7 An 
annual decrease in log 10 IUPM on ART alone would average 12*0.006 8 = 0.082, or a 17% reduction.  
 
8.5 Data Safety and Monitoring Plan  
A Data Safety and Monitoring (DSM) panel  has been formed and includes two experts in HIV clinical 
care ([CONTACT_682387], MD, MSC: Associate Professor UW Department of Medicine and [CONTACT_682388], MD: Associate Professor UW Department of Medicine), an expert in the clinical use of 
MMF ([CONTACT_682389], MD: Professor UW Department of Medicine and Member FHCRC 
Clinical Research Division) and a biostatistician with considerable experience with HIV trials ([CONTACT_682390] PhD, Professor UW Department of Biostatistics).The DSMB will focus on the safety and 
tolerance of all intervent ions, including use of MMF , phlebotomy, anoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_014], collection of rectal 
biopsies , and any events that may be related to participation in the study.  DSMB meetings will 
generally be conducted by [CONTACT_37126] -to-face meeting  or a combination of face -to-face meeting and 
teleconference, consisting of an open session and a closed session.  The first DSMB  meeting will be 
an organizational meeting to review the protocol and monitoring plan; this will occur before the 
enrollment of  the first subject.  The second meeting will occur after five participants have completed 
week 8, and then at six months , 12 months and 22 months after study initiation .  Upon completion or 
termination of the study, the DSMB will hold a final meeting.  A summary of each review will be sent 
to the amFAR Program O fficer if they do not participa te in a DSMB meeting.  The IRB will also be 
sent a summary of the main decision of the DSMB (e.g. to continue the study, modify, or stop the 
study).   
In addition to th e real -time Adverse Event review and t he DSMB review, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Joshua Schiffer 
and co -investigator [CONTACT_682391] will review accrual, visit completeness, data completeness, 
any study -related events less serious than Adverse Events, any Protocol D eviations and any “Other 
Problems” monthly and as appropriate, discuss any issues with the laboratory PI, [CONTACT_682392], 
and the full study team at the monthly protocol team meetings.  If the amFAR Medical Officer 
requests cumulative summary reports o f AEs, they wi ll be made available.  
The DSMB will periodically (as described above) review accumulating safety data by [CONTACT_1570].  
Prior to each meeting, the statistician will provide the DSMB members with a confidential report of 
safety data by [CONTACT_655824].  Reports will show interval as well as cumulative data.  Reports will show 
Clinical Protocol     
 31 the data by [CONTACT_682381]; however, upon request of the DSMB, the protocol statistician will 
provide the Board with the actual treatment group data.   
Based upon the  reports, the DSMB will determine whether to recommend that the study be continued, 
modified, or stopped for safety reasons.   
Study modification rules:   
• If there are any bowel perforations from rectal biopsies, no further rectal biopsies will be 
performed for the study.   
• If enro llment is delayed by [CONTACT_726] [ADDRESS_924130] participant 
because of failure to identify eligibl e subjects, the cumulative reasons for failure to qualify for 
the study will be reviewed, and changes may be made to eligibility criteria if the changes would 
not put participants at risk. An example of such a change would be to decrease the CD4 + T cell 
criteria for enrollment to fewer than 350 cells/mm 3.   
• If enro llment is delayed by [CONTACT_726] [ADDRESS_924131] after one week of initial MMF therapy, the MMF dose may be increased 
following a subsequent IRB approved protocol change.  It is expected that this dose increase 
will lead to more subjects fulfilling the anti -proliferation efficacy criteria. Th is and any further 
dose increase will be discussed with the DSMB, the IRB and the amFAR program officer 
before implementing.   
Study stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004]:   
• The study will be stopped if two participants  have a confirmed >  Grade 4 adverse events 
probably or defin itely due to the study drug ingested at the prescribed amount.   
• The study will be stopped if >  [ADDRESS_924132] confirmed Grade 3 adverse events probably 
or definitely due to the study drug ingested at the prescribed amount.   
 
8.6 Analyses  
Aim one anticipated results : We hypothesize at least 0.[ADDRESS_924133], descriptively, we will use  
individual linear regressions to compute a slope in log viral load ( VL) for each participant using time 
as the only covariate; and then we will describe the mean and sta ndard deviation of tha t slope. 
Secondly, we will use linear mixed effects models, as others have done ,60,[ADDRESS_924134]  for the interaction of time with treatment arm will help us determine whether the reservoir 
decreases  more quickly with ART+ MMF than with AR T only in historical controls . We will assess the 
changing composition of the reservoir using similar models and in clude the proportion of cells that are 
naive (T N) as the outcome in a generalized linear mixed model with a log link. An interaction of time 
by [CONTACT_682382].  
 
Clinical Protocol     
 [ADDRESS_924135] fully ART -suppressed HIV.  We hypothesize that the 
incidence of opportunistic infections will not excee d that of compara ble larger cohorts of HIV -treated 
patients. Of note, certain opportunistic infections such as herpes zoster or HSV -2 recurrence continue 
to occur despi[INVESTIGATOR_655760], while pneumocystis pneumonia, CMV end organ disease, 
cryptococcus and many other oppo rtunistic infections are much less common in this context. 
Therefore, in the event of an infection, we will confer with the DSM panel to discuss whether any 
event is directly attributable to MMF. Additionally, w e hypothesize that peripheral blood CD4 + and 
CD8 + T cell counts  will remain unchanged throughout  MMF therapy , and that HIV replication will 
remain well controlled on ART  with the addition of MMF.  
 
 
9.0 HUMAN SUBJECTS   
Participant will be 5 adults and children ≥ 18 and ≤[ADDRESS_924136] a current CD4 + T cell count of ≥ 350/μl.  The participants will receive 500mg MMF 
twice daily in addition to their ART regimen.  The planned MMF treatment duration is 22 months, but 
efficacy Go/no -Go algorithms at the end of month [ADDRESS_924137] plan to reside in the Seattle area for the duration of the study .  We 
anticipate pre -screening 30 potential study participants by [CONTACT_682383] 15 who wi ll be 
approached by [CONTACT_656274] -person eligibility  visit; the first [ADDRESS_924138] of MMF, who will then continue to take MMF for 22 months. Participants  
who discontinue MMF treatment due to inadequate efficacy in reducing the latent HIV reservoir at the 
12 month Go/no -Go decision point, or due to treatment related side effects, will not be replaced.   
Potential Risks include:  
(1) Stress and a nxiety could result from study participation.  These will be minimized by [CONTACT_682384], and maintenance of an open, supportive attitude by [CONTACT_25617].   
(2) Potential risks from participation in this study include those rela ted to blood draws.  All personnel 
responsible for blood drawing will be experienced phlebotomists who will follow standard procedures.  
Blood draws can be uncomfortable and cause bruising.  Some temporary anemia could occur from 
study phlebotomy.  A recor d of all study phlebotomies and blood volume drawn will be maintained for 
each participant, and total blood collection for clinical care and the study will be monitored and IRB 
limits for study purposes will not be exceeded.  Specifically, individual blood  draws will never be more 
than 2 70 mL and total volumes of blood drawn over an eight -week period will never be more than 450 
mL. 
(3) Insertion of an anoscope may be uncomfortable.  Rectal biopsies usually do not hurt.  However, it 
is possible subjects coul d feel some brief pain or  discomfort.  In rare cases , these biopsies may 
Clinical Protocol     
 [ADDRESS_924139] anal sex for 5 days after the biopsies to help prevent any possible  incre ase in risk of infection or 
bleeding.      
(4) Answering questions about smoking, alcohol use, and sexual b ehaviors may make subjects feel 
uncomfortable.    
(5) There are also potential risks related to confidentiality.  All participating staff and faculty a t the site 
will maintain the confidentiality of study subjects, and study materials that could expose identity will 
be kept in  locked cabinets or in password -protected files, accessible only to th e study personnel at 
the research clinic conducting the stud y with a  need to know.    
(6) Reports of MMF adverse reactions are based on dosages of 2 -3 grams daily (rather than 1g daily 
in this study).  A detailed description of all adverse effects and precautions is contained in the 
CellCept® Product Monograph, whic h is included in the Appendix to the Clinical Protocol.  (Of note, 
we will be using the generic version of MMF and not CellCept.)  
The principal adverse reactions associated with the oral administration of MMF include diarrhea, 
leukopenia, sepsis, and nause a and vomiting.  There also is evidence of a higher frequency of certain 
types of infections, e.g., cytomegalovirus viremia, JC virus -associated progressive multifocal 
leukoencephalopathy (PML) and polyomavirus -associated nephropathy (PVAN).  Patients rece iving 
MMF alone or as part of an immunosuppressive regimen are at increased risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_682360], particularly of the skin.  These risks appear to be related to the 
intensity and duration of immunosuppression rather than to t he use of any specific agent.   
There are also a small number of patients who received solid organ transplants and experienced 
reversible falls in their red cell or white cell counts while receiving MMF.  Additionally, cases of Pure 
Red Cell Aplasia (PRCA) have been reported in some patients receiving MMF.  PRCA is a condition in 
which the bone marrow stops producing red blood cells. In some instances, PRCA can be reversed 
by [CONTACT_532238][INVESTIGATOR_518032].   
 
MMF has embryo -fetal toxicity, causing fetal harm  when administered to a pregnant female.  Use of  
MMF during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of  first trimester pregnancy loss and an 
increased risk of congenital malformations, especially  external ear and other facial abnormalities 
including  cleft lip and palate, and anomalies of  the distal limbs, heart, esophagus, kidney and nervous 
system .   
There will be adequate protection against risks including IRB approval at the study site, written 
informed consent, rapid reporting of adverse events a nd data safety monitoring as above.  
(8) Use of ondansetron  is occasionally associated with diarrhea, headache, fever, lightheadedness, 
dizziness, weakness, fatigue, constipatio n, rash, blurred vision, urinary  retention, and muscle spasm.  
(9) The most common adverse reactions (≥20%)  for Myfortic © include anemia, leukopenia, 
constipation, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, dyspepsia, urinary tract infection, CMV infection,

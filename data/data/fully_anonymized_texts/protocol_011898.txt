Title: Con cariño: Using Promotoras for a Hispanic Community Palliative Care 
Intervention – A pi[INVESTIGATOR_13477]/Hypothesis:  We hypothesize that the intervention group (promotora -based) 
will, in comparison to a self -education group (no promotora), show  improved quality of 
life and pain scores and decreased ED visits and ICU admissions. We anticipate that 
the promotora -based program will be cost -effective.  
 
Specific Aims:  (1) To assess the impact of the promotora -based program compared to 
self-education  (usual care) on quality of life scores, pain scores, ED visits, and ICU 
admissions as assessed via survey completion and the medical record. (2) To perform a 
cost-effectiveness analysis of this intervention. (3) To utilize our findings to establish a 
nove l, culturally sensitive, outpatient, cancer palliative care program in an underserved, 
majority Latino, county hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6885].  
 
Goals of the Research: We anticipate our intervention will increase the rate of 
palliative care service utilization among unde rserved Latino cancer patients residing on 
the US -Mexico border. We believe that by [CONTACT_539493] a decrease in overall health care costs as well as an overall 
improvement in quality of life for the  Hispanic cancer patients in our community.  
 
 
Background and Significance:  Palliative care is defined as “care given to improve the 
quality of life of patients who have a serious or life -threatening disease”. The integration 
of palliative care early in the  treatment course of advanced cancer patients has been 
shown to improve quality of life, increase survival among cancer patients, and decrease 
overall healthcare costs. (Hay et al., 2017, Temel et al., 2010). Access to end of life 
care; however, is not equ al with significant disparities occurring among minorities and 
marginalized groups.  
 
A study involving patients with gynecological cancers found that non -white patients 
were less likely to enroll in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_539485] a majority reporting wishing 
to die pain free and comfortable in their homes (Harris et al., 2009). Latinos are also 
less likely to have had end of life conversations with health care providers and may 
therefore be less informed regarding end of life issues such as advance dir ectives. This 
is despi[INVESTIGATOR_539486] (Shen et al., 2016).  
 
End of life costs are a great burden for many Latinos. Up to 25% or more of healthcare 
costs are amounted in a patient ’s last year of life, making end of life care especially 
difficult for this group and others of low socioeconomic status (Riley & Lubitz, 2010). In 
a study by [CONTACT_539494]., it was found that Latinos’ Medicare expenditures are 57% 
higher than Whites in t heir last six months of life ($21,166 vs $31,702 even with 
controlling for sex, age, morbidity -burden level, cause and site of death) (Hanchate, 
Kronman, Young -Xu, Ash, & Emmanuel, 2009). A lack of insurance and immigration 
status increases this burden. Cu rrently there are 11.1 million undocumented immigrants 
in the US which account for 14.6% of the uninsured population. These individuals rarely 
have access to appropriate end of life care due to costs (Jaramillo & Hui, 2016). Along 
the US -Mexico border thes e figures are exponentially increased. In 2008, prior to the 
Affordable Care Act, nearly half of the US residents living along the Mexico -US border 
had no health insurance and about 63% of the uninsured were undocumented foreign -
born individuals (Su, Pratt , Stimpson, Wong, & Pagán, 2014). The uninsured rate 
decreased to 31% by 2012 among residents living in the US -Mexico border region; yet 
the majority remained unable to access health care (Shen, M., Gai, Y., & Feng, 2016).  
 
The lack of insurance, increased  cancer -care burden, and cultural barriers are leaving 
many dying Latinos and their families vulnerable at one of the most difficult times. It is 
imperative that innovative approaches are considered to provide the best care at the 
end of life. Moreover, th is could potentially decrease costs to Medicare and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600].  
      
Our aim is to test the cost effectiveness with respect to the healthcare system with an 
innovative approach for palliative care education intended to increase the quality of care 
at the end of life for Latinos in a US -Mexico border town. Our goal is to use promotoras 
(community health workers) to provide palliative services to patients diagnosed with 
advanced cancer. This model has demonstrated success in other behavioral 
modification pro grams such as those designed to increase cervical cancer screening 
rates, increase vaccination uptake, and medication adherence. In a program using lay 
navigators among elderly oncology patients with Medicare it was estimated that a total 
of 19 million dol lars in costs per year was eliminated among the navigated patients. ED 
visits decreased by 6% per quarter in navigated compared to non -navigated patients, 
ICU admissions were reduced by 10.6%; and lastly, the cost of using a navigator gave a 
return on inve stment of 1:10 (Rocque et al., 2017).  
      
We believe that we can use promotoras in the context of a culturally -sensitive palliative 
education program. We hypothesize that this intervention will decrease healthcare costs 
through a reduction in ED visits and ICU admissions. Additionally, we hypothesize that 
promotora -based education regarding self -care will reduce depression, improve pain 
control, and improve overall quality of care as perceived by [CONTACT_539495] a 
Latino underserved community.  
 
 
Innovation:  
 
El Paso, a town in the US -Mexico border, is home to over 800,000 residents of which 
82% are Hispanic/Latino, almost a quarter of its population does not have health 
insurance and 20% lives below the federal poverty line. El Paso along with m any other 
border towns suffers from an increasing burden due to health disparities and lack of 
health access. It is estimated that along the [LOCATION_007] -Mexico border there is [ADDRESS_703174] effective.  
 
 
Research Design and Methods:  
 
Study Population: Our study population will include men and women with a dvanced 
cancer or with a new change in prognosis i.e. metastasis or recurrence of primary 
cancer  and/or their caregivers . Participants must be over the age of [ADDRESS_703175]. The subjects will be recruited from [LOCATION_007] Tech clinics as well 
as from University Medical Center where they will be invited to participate.  
 
Sample Size:  
Promotora study:  A total of 150 patients will be recruited and wil l be randomly assigned 
to either the control or intervention groups.  
 
Caregiver study:  A total of 150 caregivers will be recruited.  
 
Recruitment plan:  
Promotora study:  
• Each patient will be recruited via the [LOCATION_007] Tech clinics  and the  University 
Medical Center (UMC) : palliative care service , the UMC cancer navigation 
program , and the infusion center . Each patient and their caregivers will be invited 
and those who desire to participate will be contact[CONTACT_539496]. A screening survey w ill be done to see if they first qualify. Patients 
already enrolled in inpatient or outpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_539487]. Interested 
and qualifying individuals will be consented by [CONTACT_16133]. At this time, the 
participant will also complete baselin e survey s: Demographics, Patient Health 
Questionnaire -9 (PHQ -9), and Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness 
Therapy -Palliative  Care  (FACIT -Pal). Participants can choose whether to fill out 
the surveys on their own ( self-administer ) or have a research  staff member read 
the questions and mark the answer choices on their behalf (structured 
interview).   
 
 
• Participants will be randomized into either the intervention ( also known as the 
study group or the promotora ) group  or the control ( also known as self -educa tion 
or control ) group. Each participant will continue to receive the standard of care 
for his or her oncologic diagnosis as determined by [CONTACT_539497]. During the study period, all participants will 
complete baseline  (demographics, PHQ -9, FACIT -Pal), interim (adverse events) 
and exit (adverse events, PHQ -9, FACIT -Pal) surveys . Information pertaining to 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_539488]. The intervention group will have three face -to-
face meetings with the promotora.  The control group will receive two phone calls.  
 
• If the patient is in the intervention group, the promotora will call the patient in 
order to invite them to a meeting. Me etings will be arranged by [CONTACT_539498].  Participants  will be encouraged to bring support persons to the 
promotora meetings.   
o Meeting 1  topic : What is cancer, Medical Management, What is palliative  
care, Local resources, Goals and Expect ations , Discussion . Total time: 45 
min 
o Meeting 2  topic : Taking care of self: physical activity, nutrition, pain 
management , Family Values, Total: 50 min  
o Meeting 3  topic : Caregiver burnout, patient’s wishes, revisit Goals and 
Expectations. Making  hard decis ions, planning for the future (Power of 
Attorney, Advance Directives) . Local resources, support groups, the 
grieving process. Exit interview  (Re-administration of FACIT -Pal and PHQ -
9 and advanced directives ) Total: 45 min  
 
At the beginning of each meeting the patient s will be asked about adverse events 
(hospi[INVESTIGATOR_210364] ). This data will be validated against the 
information stored within the patient’s medical record  
 
 If the patient is in the control group, they will receive two phone calls. The  first 
phone call will be to ask about adverse events that have occurred since 
enrollment into the study. The second call will be to ask about adverse events 
since the first phone call and to administer the exit interview (Re -administration of 
FACIT -Pal an d PHQ -9).  
 
Caregiver study:  
All patients recruited to the study will be asked to identify their caregiver to take the 
caregiver financial survey. The caregiver may be of any race or gender. If the caregiver 
is with the participant and if they  would like t o participate, they will be told the survey is 
completely confidential, voluntary, and they may refuse to answer any question  that will 
make them feel uncomfortable. If the caregiver is not with the participant, we will give 
the participant a study flyer w ith research staff contact [CONTACT_3031]. The study may be 
administered  via phone, in person, or via email, based on the caregivers' preference. If 
the caregiver would like to participate, they will assigned a participant identification 
number which will be randomly assigned by [CONTACT_61604].   
 
[LOCATION_007] Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_539489] (PUDF) analysis:  Because 
both arms of the study technically had an intervention simply participating in the study 
may have also had an impact. A way to assess this would  be to compare the rate of 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_539490]. A retrospective chart 
review of [LOCATION_007] Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_539489] (PUDF) will be 
conducted in which patients have the principal discharge  diagnosis field contained an 
ICD-9 code for a malignant neoplasm (codes 140* through 208*, where the asterisk 
represents a wild card operator) and the patient was discharged to either hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6125] -home 
or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6125] –medical facility.  
 
Incentives:  
Promotora study:  Each participant will receive $70 for completion of the entire survey 
set: Participants in the study group will receive $25 at randomization, $[ADDRESS_703176] 
meeting with the promotora, $10 for the second meeting with the promotora, and $[ADDRESS_703177]  meeting with the promotora. Participants in the control group will receive $25 at 
randomization, $[ADDRESS_703178] phone interview, and $30 will be mailed 
to participant after second/final phone interview.    
 
 
Caregiver study:  The caregiv er will not receive an incentive.  
 
Challenges:  
We anticipate that a potential difficulty will be participant retention. Additionally, as we 
will be recruiting many patients at the end of life, we recognize that hospi[INVESTIGATOR_539491]. As participants are individuals with advanced 
stage cancer, death is a likely occurrence in many cases and will not be considered an 
adverse or unexpected event. We will accommodate timing issues by [CONTACT_539499] r week . The participants will also be compensated for 
their time. Additionally, we will enable in person collection of survey materials at the 
location of patients who are either hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], become confined at home, or who 
transfer into inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_539492]. As the participants will have 
complex medical issues, we will have the support of a gynecologic -oncologist and a 
medical oncologist for any emergent medical concerns that may arise until the patient 
may be seen by [CONTACT_539500]. We anticipate that the study will take [ADDRESS_703179] 
will lay the groun dwork for a larger, comprehensive, and culturally sensitive palliative 
program that may be generalized to other centers to decrease the cancer care burden 
in the Hispanic community.  
 
 
Statistical Analysis:  
For the caregiver portion of the study, we are co nducting a pi[INVESTIGATOR_48505] a working 
number of 150 participants.  
 
For the patient portion of the study; a  required sample size of 150 eligible patients was 
estimated  based on a preliminary power calculation. It was determined with an alpha of 
.05 and pow er of 0.8 that a reduction of Emergency Department visits of 79%, [ADDRESS_703180] -G will be 
more subtle, we would like to recruit 75 patients per arm.  
 
For the PUDF portion of the study, we wi ll be reviewing 588 records.  
 
The data will be  analyzed as an intent -to-treat analysis. Because of the multiplicity of 
Quality of Life (QoL) outcome measures  and potential correlations among the scales, 
each QoL scale was tested at a  significance level of .01 (.05/5) to control for the overall 
type I error at .05. As  the overall measure of QoL was the F unctional Assessment of 
Cancer Therapy scale –General (FACT -G), it will be  considered the primary  QoL 
outcome.  
 
We will be performing a standard cost -effect iveness analysis using TreeAge software.

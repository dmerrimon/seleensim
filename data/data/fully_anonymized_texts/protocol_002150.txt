 ABBREVIATIONS: NAS, NEONATAL ABSTINENCE SYNDROME  
   DOCUMENT DATE: MARCH 27, [ADDRESS_453918] of  a major 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_364219]. This current epi[INVESTIGATOR_364220], i.e. Subutex and Saboxone. As prescription pi[INVESTIGATOR_364221], addicts are seeking similar, cheaper drugs; such as heroin.  From [ADDRESS_453919] pregnant women has 
increased by 127%, from 1.7 per 1000 to 3.9 per 1000. Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS) or neonatal opi[INVESTIGATOR_364222] a condition produces gastrointes tinal 
and autonomic neurologic dysfunction. Infants with severe withdrawal experience dysregulation of autonomic functions, resulting in feeding difficulty, diarrhea, excessive sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008], and tremors.  Nearly two thirds of all babies exposed to opi[INVESTIGATOR_364223] a neonatal intensive care unit for management of withdrawal symptoms. During a typi[INVESTIGATOR_364224] (NICU) at Kentucky Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_364225] 100- 120 infants exhibiting NAS 
symptoms; these infants have a typi[INVESTIGATOR_364226] [ADDRESS_453920] been “captured.” At this point a slow weaning of his morphine dose occurs. The infants’ clinical status is assessed with the Finnegan Scoring system, which examines symptoms such as crying, excessive sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_364227] s leepi[INVESTIGATOR_007], insomnia, or 
tremors along with objective findings such as temperature and respi[INVESTIGATOR_697].  
 In addition to pharmacotherapy, alternative and complementary medicine techniques are 
slowly entering the NAS treatment algorithm. Treatments such as music therapy infant 
massage, kangaroo care, aromatherapy, and acupressure are now employed in NICUs in addition to traditional opi[INVESTIGATOR_364228]. However, few studies exist in the literature to evaluate their effectiveness.  
Aromatherapy is the practice of  using natural essential oils to achieve a desired effect in 
an individual. Scents such as lavender and chamomile have been documented to have a soothing calming effect. Studies involving infants shown that lavender not only reduce crying and enhance sleep, but also reduce levels of salivary cortisol, a stress hormone. Additionally, aromatherapy is currently used as an adjunctive therapy at the University of Kentucky’s Markey Cancer Center.  
 Salivary cortisol is a non- invasive biomarker that has proven useful for monitoring stress 
in neonates. It is a simple and painless method for monitoring the stress hormone cortisol. Salivary cortisol has been used successfully in infants as a method to assess infant stress associated with prone position versus supi[INVESTIGATOR_179413].  These studies have shown that 
salivary cortisol levels vary with stressful or soothing stimuli.  
 
To date, no dangerous or deleterious effects have been described from traditional inhalational use of aromatherapy or with salivary cortisol sampling. Studies have shown aromatherapy to be an effective adjunctive therapy by [CONTACT_114220] a calming effect. In our patient population it may prove to be a useful complimentary therapy ultimately reducing infant stress, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7577], and burden of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441]. Additionally, salivary 
cortisol’s ease of collection and non- invasive nature make it an ideal biomarker to study.  
 
 INCLUSION/EXCLUSION CRITERIA  
Inclusion Criteria:  
 - Infants greater than or equal to 36 weeks EGA  
 - Intrauterine opi[INVESTIGATOR_5437]  
 - Primary diagnosis of NAS  
 - Parental permission to participate  
 
 
Exclusion Criteria:  
 - Infants less than 36 weeks EGA  
 - Major congenital anomalies  
 - Latrogenic drug withdrawal  
 - Diagnosis of infection or respi[INVESTIGATOR_1506]  
 - Prior initiation of o pi[INVESTIGATOR_5438]  
 - Non-English speaking 
 - Infants with respi[INVESTIGATOR_364229]. Patients will be randomized to one of two groups using block randomization in groups of four. The study will not be blinded (open- label).  
  STANDARD OF CARE AND INTERVENT ION 
 Standard of care will include quiet environment, occupational therapy, music therapy and 
infant massage. Kangaroo care and breast feeding will be encouraged based on clinical recommendations.  
 Interventional treatment will include all aspects of the standard of care in addition to aromatherapy. Patches will be obtained from BioEsse Technologies™ and will have an 80:[ADDRESS_453921] dose. When 
activated, each patch releases, the mixture over a 2-8 hour period by [CONTACT_364231] a 
constant diffusion rate. These will be attached to a positioning device placed in the infant’s 
bassinet 6- 8 inches from  the infant’s nose for a period of 4 hours twice a day.  
   ASSESSMENT  
 Comfort levels will be  assessed using the MOTHER -NAS scoring system . After three 
consecutive scores of greater than or equal to 9 or two consecutive scores of greater than 
or equal to 13 , replacement morphine (0.05mg/kg/dose every three hours) will be initiated. 
After 48 hours  of symptom control,  morphine  will be  weaned  by 0.02mg/day.  Any 
significant increase in scores that accompanied the  wean will induce a return to the 
previous dose.  
 
DATA COLLECTION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS PLAN  
 Data will be collected from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_364230] a secure 
manner. Data  will include: 1) date of birth, 2) date of admission, 3) birth weight, 4) gender, 
5) APGAR  scores, 6) mode of delivery, 7) place of birth, 8) type of prenatal drug ex posure, 
9) prenatal care, 10) Finnegan scores, 11) average daily heart rate, 12) daily morphine 
dose,  13) total morphine dose per day, 14) length of treatment, and 15) length of 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
 
Data will be analyzed using  standard statistical techniques.  The two treatment groups  will 
be compared with a two- tailed t -test, while d ichotomous variables w ill be  examined with 
a Chi-Square test. Statistical significance w ill be set at p=0.05.

 PRÉCIS  
Background 
• Although malignant gliomas display genetic heterogeneity, several key proliferation and 
survival signaling pathways have been identified. 
• Recent work has focused on targeting these tumor specific pathways in hopes of improving treatment efficacy and minimizing treatment toxicity.  Because molecularly targeted agents have been mostly ineffective when used alone, combination therapy that inhibits multiple pathways is an appealing strategy.  
• Sorafenib is an oral multi -kinase inhibitor with effects on tumor proliferation and tumor 
angiogenesis. Although most GBMs lack RAF mutations, targeting the R AF/MEK/ERK 
pathway may be beneficial as this pathway may be activated by [CONTACT_264322].  
• The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) protein is a downstream component of the 
PI3K/Akt pathway. Everolimus (everolimus; [COMPANY_001]) is a  novel oral derivative of 
rapamycin  
• Combining everolimus and sorafenib allows targeting of both the PI3K pathway and the 
RAF -MAPK pathway and in addition targets VEGF and PDGF, other active targets in 
malignant glioma.   
Objectives  
Phase 1 
• To determine the  maximum tolerated dose and safety of everolimus in combination with 
sorafenib for patients with recurrent malignant gliomas.  
Phase 2 
• 6-month progression free survival rate for glioblastoma patients with no prior bevacizumab 
exposure treated with everolimu s and sorafenib at the maximum tolerated dose as 
determined in the phase I study. 
• 3-month progression free survival rate for glioblastoma patients with prior bevacizumab 
exposure treated with everolimus and sorafenib at the maximum tolerated dose as determ ined in the phase I study. 
• 6-month progression free survival rate for AG patients with no prior bevacizumab exposure 
treated with everolimus and sorafenib at the maximum tolerated dose as determined in the phase I study. 
Eligibility  
• Patients with histologically proven recurrent intracranial malignant glioma will be eligible for the phase I/II component of this protocol.   
• Patients must be ≥ 18 years old with a Karnofsky performance status of ≥ 60. 
• No more than 2 prior chemotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_13265] 1 relapse.  Prior be vacizumab therapy is allowed.  
Design  
Abbreviated Title: Ph 1/2 Everolimus & Sorafenib  
Version Date:  06/15/18  Page 5 of 99 
 • This is a phase 1 /2 study of everolimus and sorafenib in patients with recurrent high -grade 
gliomas . 
• Phase 1: Patients will be treated with daily everolimus (days 1 -28) in combination with 
sorafenib .  
• Phase 2: Patients will be treated with the combination of sorafenib and everolimus. 
Sorafenib will be taken daily for 7 days on, then 7 days off.  Everolimus will be taken daily.  
• There is not a defined set maximum number of cycles that a patient may have.  Patients  
may continue with protocol therapy until criteria for “Off Treatment” is met.  Patients will 
then be followed every 3 months for survival status. 
• There will be an accrual of approximately 3 -6 eligible patients per cohort to the Phase I 
component of the study.  Patients removed at any time for toxicity are evaluable.  Phase I 
patients removed from study treatment within 28 days for reasons other than toxicity may be replaced.  
• There will be a total accrual of approximately 82 eligible patients to the Phase I I study (34 
recurrent GBM with no prior exposure to bevacizumab, 16 recurrent Anaplastic Glioma with no prior exposure to bevacizumab, and 32 glioblastoma with prior exposure to bevacizumab).

 1.0 INTRODUCTION 
 OBJECTIVES  
 Phase I  
• To determine the maximum tolerated dose and safety of everolimus  in combination 
with sorafenib for patients with recurrent malignant gliomas.  
 Phase II  
[IP_ADDRESS] Primary endpoints:  
• 6 month progression free survival rate for glioblastoma  patients with no prior  
bevacizumab exposure treated with everolimus and sorafenib at the maximum  
tolerated dose as determined in the phase I study. 
• 3 month progression free survival rate for glioblastoma patients with prior 
bevacizumab exposure treated with everolimus and sorafenib at the maximum 
tolerated  dose as determined in the phase I study. 
• 6 month progression free survival rate for AG patients with no prior bevacizumab 
exposure treated with everolimus and sorafenib at the maximum tolerated dose as 
determined in the phase I study. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Secondary endpoints: 
• Time to progression and overall survival for recurrent malignant glioma patients 
(Group A, Group B , and Group C ) treated with everolimus  and sorafenib measured 
from time of study enrollment.  
• Objective response rate for recurrent malignant gliomas (Group  A, Group B, and 
Group C  treated with everolimus and sorafenib  
• Patient related outcome measures  
To evaluate the occurrence of symptoms and correlate to disease progression  and 
tolerance to treatment using the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory -Brain  Tumor 
Module (MDASI- BT) self -reporting tool.  This will include: 
o To evaluate longitudinal changes in symptom measures and determine the 
impact of the therapy on these parameters.  
o To measure symptom burden over the course of therapy to evaluate  
differences between patients individual symptom severity, overall  mean 
symptom severity, and difference in scores on the interference items 
between responders and non-responders. 
o To describe the variability of symptom severity longitudinally over the treatment  course and follow-up period.  
 BACKGROUND  
Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary brain tumor.  With optimal tr eatment, 
consisting of focal radiotherapy with concurrent chemotherapy, followed by [CONTACT_72625], median survival is 14.6 months. ( 1
)  Cure is exceptional and most patients have 
Abbreviated Title: Ph 1/2 Everolimus & Sorafenib  
Version Date:  06/15/18  Page 9 of 99 
 evidence of tumor progression within one year of diagnosis despi[INVESTIGATOR_2391].  At progression, 
treatment options are limited and mostly ineffective; most clinical trials demonstrate six month progression free survival rate of only 9- 15% and median overall survival is less than 25 w eeks 
from time of tumor progression. ( 2
)  Recently, bevacizumab  was approved for recurrent GBM 
based on data from Vredenburgh et al. and Kreisl et al.( 3, 4)  Data on patients who fail 
bevacizumab indicate a short survival, on the order of  10 weeks, an approximate PFS 3 and 6 
months of 0%. 
Anaplastic Astrocytoma (WHO grade III astrocytoma), although less aggressive than GBM, is a malignant tumor with a median survival of less than 3 years from diagnosis and estimated 5- year 
survival of 28% despi[INVESTIGATOR_264252] ( 2, 5
) 
Although malignant gliomas display  genetic heterogeneity, several key proliferation and survival 
signaling pathways have been identified  (6).  Recent work has focused on targeting these tumor 
specific pathways in hopes of improving treatment efficacy and minimizing treatment toxicity.  Because molecularly targeted agents have been mostly ineffective when used alone, combination therapy that i nhibits multiple pathways is an appealing strategy.  
 Kinase Inhibitors:  
Most growth factors initiate intracellular second messenger signaling systems through activation of tyrosine and/or serine/threonine kinase receptors.  The kinase regions catalyze trans fer of 
phosphate groups from adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to transmembrane receptors or signal transducers to initiate signaling pathway activation.    The development of kinase inhibitors in cancer treatment has been stimulated by [CONTACT_264323] (CML) and gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIT).  Imatinib mesylate specifically inhibits kinase activities associated with bcr -abl, c -kit, and PDGF receptor which are 
improperly regulated in CML and GIT.   
Research has identified specific aberrant pathways that are thought to be important in malignant 
gliomas.  (6
) Specifically inhibiting these aberrant pathways may improve outcome without 
significant toxicity.  
 Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway inhibitors: 
Malignant gliomas are highly vascular tumors that depend on angiogenesis for growth and 
prolif eration.  VEGF pathway inhibitors were developed to inhibit tumor angiogenesis.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_264253], most VEGF inhibitors failed to yield long term survival benefits as single agents.  Success has been achieved by [CONTACT_264324]  (7
).  Bevacizumab, an anti -VEGF antibody, has shown 
encouraging results when combined with irinotecan in a phase II trial for GBM.( 4) (8) 
 Multi-targeted kinase inhibitors: 
When used alone, targeted agents have been mostly ineffective in the treatment of malignant gliomas.  This is thought to be secondary to the existence of multiple parallel or compensatory 
oncogenic pathways that allow tumor cells to escape and survive.  To combat this problem, newer -
generation small -molecule kinase inhibitors are designed to target multiple aberrant signaling 
pathways in the tumors and tumor- associated vasculature.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Sorafenib (BAY 43-9006): 
Abbreviated Title: Ph 1/2 Everolimus & Sorafenib  
Version Date:  06/15/18  Page 10 of 99 
 Sorafenib is an oral multi -kinase inhibitor with effects on tumor proliferation and tumor  
angiogenesis.  (9)  It was initially selected based on inhibitory activity against the serine/threonine 
kinases Raf -1 and wild- type B -Raf, which are pi[INVESTIGATOR_264254]/Raf/MEK/ERK 
signaling pathway.  Inhibitory activity was subsequently demonstrated against tyrosine kinases for 
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor and platelet -derived growth factor (PDGF) 
receptor as well as Flt -3 and c -Kit. (9) Although most GBMs lack RAF mutations, targeting the 
RAF/MEK/ERK pathway may be beneficial as this pathway may be activated by [CONTACT_264325].  
The Raf/MEK/ERK pathway is an important mediator of responses to growth factors, and a strong inducer of genes involved in tumorigenesis, angiogenesis, apoptosis, and tumorigenesis. ( 10
)   
In preclinical studies, sorafenib demonstrated broad- spectrum anti -tumor activity by [CONTACT_264326] a variety of tumor types. In the murine renal adenocarcinoma (Renca)  (11
) and VHL -/- xenograft models, sorafenib prevented 
tumor growth, primarily through the inhibition of tumor -cell-induced angiogenesis and also 
induced tumor apoptosis and necrosis.  
The safety and clinical activity of sorafenib, alone ( 12-15) or in combination ( 16,17 ) with 
chemotherapy, has been examined in a series of phase I stu dies conducted in patients with solid 
tumors. Results of a  multi- center, randomized, placebo- controlled, double -blind phase III trial of 
sorafenib in advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) were first reported in 2005.  (18)  There was a 
progression free survival advantage for the sorafenib group (5.5 months vs 2.8 months). Subsequent overall survival was not different between the groups overall, but when patients who crossed over to receive sorafenib were excluded, there was a survival benefit.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Rationale and Experience for Use of Sorafenib in GBM 
Both increased activation of angiogenesis and the MAP Kinase pathway  are associated with the 
mesenchymal/angiogenic phenotype and resistance to standard therapy in newly diagnosed glioblastoma ( GBM ). Sorafenib is a multi -functional small molecule inhibitor that targets both the 
Raf/MAP Kinase pathway and VEGF receptors, an d is thus a potentially ideal agent for targeting 
GBM with the mesenchymal/angiogenic phenotype.  
A Phase I study of single agent sorafenib in recurrent malignant glioma (B.  Nabors, PI, NABTT study) has accrued 43 patients, including 27 glioblastoma patients. Dosages up to 800mg BID were tolerated well, with only grade 3 hand-foot syndrome observed in up to 33% of patients at 400mg BID and 800mg BID.  Observed toxicities were similar in patients on enzyme -inducing anti -
epi[INVESTIGATOR_264255] -inducing anti -epi[INVESTIGATOR_23698]. Pharmacokinetic parameters also 
demonstrated no significant differences between enzyme -inducing and non- enzyme inducing anti -
epi[INVESTIGATOR_264256]. There were [ADDRESS_321336] 41 evaluable p atients, suggesting significant single agent activity.  
 PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways:  
Apoptosis, commonly called programmed cell death in developmental biology, is a major mechanism of cell death in response to many toxic stimuli, including withdrawal of external  
survival signals and DNA damage.  Resistance to apoptosis is one of the hallmarks of cancer.  The mammalian target of rapamycin ( mTOR ) protein is a downstream component of the PI3K/Akt 
pathway.( 6
)  It regulates proliferation by [CONTACT_264327], thus driving cell cycle progression.  Tumors that 
Abbreviated Title: Ph 1/2 Everolimus & Sorafenib  
Version Date:  06/15/[ADDRESS_321337] by [CONTACT_264328] (eg. EGFR and/or deletion of PTEN) is significantly associated with increasing tumor grade, decreased levels of apoptosis, and adverse clinical outcome in human gliomas.  mTOR is represented by [CONTACT_264329], 
mTORC1 (mTOR complex 1, rapamycin sensitive) and mTORC2 (mTOR complex 2, rapamycin insensitive). (19
)  mTORC1 is mainly activated via the PI3 kinase pathway through AKT (also 
known as PKB, protein kinase B) and the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC1/TSC2).( 20) Activated 
AKT phosphorylates TSC2, which lead to the dissociation of TSC1/TSC2 complex, thus inhibiting the ability of TSC2 to act as a GTPase activating protein. This allow s Rheb, a small G -protein, to 
remain in a GTP bound state and to activate mTORC1. AKT can also activate mTORC1 by [CONTACT_129554]40 phosphorylation, thereby [CONTACT_214791]40- mediated inhibition of mTORC1.(
21)  
mTORC2 (mTOR complex 2) is activated through a currently unknown mechanism, possibly by [CONTACT_129556] (RTK) signaling .(
21) It has been suggested that mTORC2 phosphorylates 
and activates a different pool of AKT, that is not upstream of mTORC1.  Therefore, targeting mTOR is a promising  target in the clinical management of glioma patients.  A phase II study of 
temsirolimus, a mTOR inhibitor, in recurrent GBM demonstrated modest efficacy with some evidence of activity based on molecular phenotype . (
10)  Everolimus (everolimus ; [COMPANY_001]) is a 
novel oral derivative of rapamycin. 
It is not clear which molecular determinants predict responsiveness of tumor cells to everolimus . 
Molecular analysis has revealed that relative sensi tivity to everolimus in vitro correlates with the 
degree of phosphorylation (activation) of the AKT/PKB protein kinase and the S6 ribosomal protein. PTEN status alone may not be predictive of everolimus  relative in vitro sensitivity, 
however in some cases (i.e., GBM) there is also a correlation with PTEN  status  (active vs inactive).  
In preclinical models, the administration of everolimus is associated with reduction of protein 
phosphorylation in target proteins downstream of mTOR, notably phosphorylated S6 (pS6) and p4E-BP1, and occasionally with an increase in phosphorylation AKT (pAKT). 
 Rationale for combination therapy: 
Preclinical data suggest that blocking more than one target more effectively inhib its tumor growth.  
(22)  Combining everolimus and sorafenib allows targeting of both the  PI3K pathway and the 
RAF -MAPK pathway and in addi tion targets VEGF and PDGF, other active targets in malignant 
glioma.  Trials of mTOR inhibition (not everolimus ) with sorafenib are underway but the dose of 
the mTOR inhibitor, in particular CCI -779, being used in one of these trials is sufficiently low t hat 
it is likely not therapeutic.  We believe that the combination of everolimus and sorafenib will be 
more tolerable, thus allowing therapeutic doses of both.  In addition, continuous oral dosing of both may provide a more sustained pathway inhibition. 
 Rationale for patient outcomes measures: 
[IP_ADDRESS] Rationale for the patient -reported outcomes:   
This study seeks to establish effective therapi[INVESTIGATOR_264257] .  We hypothesize that using a combination of everolimus and 
sorafenib  will result in improved survival.  However, given the intensive nature of this regimen, it 
will be important to determine whether any determined survival benefit is associated with improvements in symptoms or does a worsening of symptoms offset the increase in survival.

 Precedence for measuring “non -therapeutic” endpoints exists in oncology research.  For example, 
Gemcitabine was approved by [CONTACT_264330] a consequence of the decrease in pain reported 
in pancreatic patients who were treated, not on the basis of survival improvement which was 
modest, at best (23).  There have been efforts in neuro -oncology to evaluate secondary endpoints 
using validated instruments as an additional indicator of benefit.   
The M.D. Anderson Symptom Inventory -Brain Tumor Module (MDASI -BT) allo ws the self -
reporting of symptom severity and interference with daily activities.  The MDASI -BT has 
demonstrated reliability and validity in the adult primary brain tumor patient population (24). This 
tool represents a modification of the widely used and validated MDASI, with particular  attention 
to symptoms common in patients with brain tumors.   The availability of validated instruments provides an opportunity to prospectively assess the impact of treatment, both positive and negative, on patients.  This evaluation of  symptom burden in this study will assist in finding the best possible 
treatment with the least toxicity.  
 Summary of Phase I Toxicities   
Dose Level 1 had 3/6 patients who had a DLT, necessitating a dose reduction to dose level - 1.  At 
that level only 1/6 DLTs was seen hence this is the MTD for phase II.

eligible for the phase I/II component of this protocol.  Malignant glioma includes glioblastoma (GBM), Gliosarcoma (GS), anaplastic astrocytoma (AA), anaplastic oligodendroglioma (AO), anaplastic mixed  oligoastrocytoma (AMO), or malignant 
astrocytoma NOS (not otherwise specified). Patients will be eligible if the original histology was low -grade glioma and a subsequent histological diagnosis of a malignant 
glioma is made.  
[IP_ADDRESS] All patients must sign an infor med consent indicating that they are aware of the 
investigational nature of this study.  Patients must have signed an authorization for the release of their protected health information  at all sites except the NIH . 
[IP_ADDRESS] Patients must be > 18 years old. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Patients must have a Karnofsky performance status of > 60. 
[IP_ADDRESS] No more than 2 prior chemotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_13265] 1 relapse.  Prior bevacizumab therapy is 
allowed.  
• Patients must have recovered from the toxic effects of prior therapy: >3 weeks for biologic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_264258]- cytotoxic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], >4 weeks for cytotoxic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], and 
>6 weeks for nitrosoureas. Any questions related to the definition of non-cytotoxic 
agents should be directed to the Study Chair. 
NOTE:  13 cis -retinoic acid (Accutane) as biologic therapy has a washout period of 14 
days.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Patients must have adequate bone marrow function (WBC ≥ 3.0 x 109/L, ANC  ≥ 1.5 X 
109/L, platelet count of  ≥100 x 109/L, and hemoglobin ≥ 10 gm/d L), adequate liver 
function (SGOT and bilirubin < [ADDRESS_321340]), and adequate renal  function (creatinine 
< 1.7mg/dL or creatinine clearance > 60 cc/min) before starting therapy.  These tests 
must be performed within 14 days prior to registration.  Eligibility level for hemoglobin may be reached by [CONTACT_29470].  
[IP_ADDRESS] Patients must have shown unequivocal radiographic evidence for tumor progression by [CONTACT_264331] [IP_ADDRESS].5.  A scan should be performed within 
14 days  prior to registration and on a steroid dose that has been stable or decreasing for 
Abbreviated Title: Ph 1/2 Everolimus & Sorafenib  
Version Date:  06/15/[ADDRESS_321341] 5 days. If the steroid dose is increased between  the date of imaging and 
registration a new baseline MR I/CT is required. The same type of scan, i.e., MRI or 
CT mus t be used throughout the period of protocol treatment for tumor measurement. 
Measurable disease is NOT required.   
Note:  *MRI is the preferable imaging method ; CT scan may be used in cases where 
an MRI cannot be obtained.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Patients having undergone recent  resection of recurrent or progressive tumor will be 
eligible as long as all of the following conditions apply: 
• They have recovered from the effects of surgery and be > 3 weeks from surgery.  
• Residual disease following resection of recurrent malignant glioma is not mandated 
for eligibility into the study.  To best assess the extent of residual disease post -
operatively, a CT/ MRI should be done no later than [ADDRESS_321342] -operatively, within 14 days prior to 
registration.  If the 96- hour scan is more than 14 days before registration, the scan 
needs to be repeated.  If the steroid dose is increased between the date of imaging and registration, a new baseline MRI/CT is required on a stable steroid dosage for at least 5 days.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Patient s must have failed  prior radiation therapy and must have an interval of greater 
than or equal to 12 weeks from the completion of radiation therapy to registration; 
except if patients underwent surgery within 12 weeks and pa thology is consistent with 
recurrent tumor. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Patients with prior therapy that included interstitial brachytherapy or stereotactic radiosurgery must have confirmation of true progressive disease rather than radiation necrosis  based upon either PET or Thallium scanning, MR  spectroscopy or 
surgical/pathological documentation of disease.

documented within [ADDRESS_321343] dose of study medications. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Patients receiving anti -coagulation treatment with an agent such as warfarin or heparin 
may be allowed to participate.  For patients on warfarin, the INR should be measured prior to initiation of sorafenib and monitored at least weekly, or as defined by [CONTACT_23608],  until INR is stable.  
 Phase I Inclusion Criteria  
The following modifications to the general eligibility criteria apply to Phase I patients only.  
• Patients may have had treatment for any number of prior relapses. Relapse is defined 
as progression following initial therapy (i.e. surgery and radiation+/ - chemo if that was 
used as initial therapy).  
 Phase II Inclusion Criteria  
• Phase II patients must meet the following Eligibility Criteria in addition to the General Criteria described above.  Patients may have had  treatment for no more than 1 prior 
relapse (i.e. failed [ADDRESS_321344] relapse) at 
2
nd relapse, treatment per BTTC09 -01 is an option; see relapse and treatment count

Version Date:  06/15/18  Page 15 of 99 
 table below).  Relapse is defined as progression following initial therapy (i.e. 
radiation+/ - chemo if that was used as initial therapy).  The intent therefore is that 
patients had no more than 2 prior therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (initial and treatment for 1 relapse). If the 
patient had a surgical resection fo r relapsed disease and no anti -cancer therapy was 
instituted for up to [ADDRESS_321345] relapse.

 BASELINE EVALUATION  
After eligibility is confirmed, complete the following baseline study tasks:  
• Patients will complete a baseline MD Anderson Symptom Inventory-Brain Tumor 
Module (MDASI- BT) ( Appendix 13.4) within 14 days (+ 3 working days) after 
enrollment on the clinical trial. The MDASI -BT will be completed only by [CONTACT_102], 
unless changes in vision or weakness make this difficult. If this occurs, then the caregiver 
or research assistant may read the questions to the patient or assist with marking the 
severity number or score as described by [CONTACT_102]. A patient caregiver may complete the questionnaires as a patient- preference proxy if the patient’s deficits preclude self -
report.   
• The screening scan can be used as the baseline scan if performed within 14 days of 
registration on a stable dose of steroids.  Patients should not be on a steroid dose higher than 16 mg/day.  (Refer to [IP_ADDRESS] and [IP_ADDRESS]) 
• Document baseline adverse events  
• For all women of childbearing potential, negative serum pregnancy test within 7 days of 
starting treatment.  
• If treatment will start > 14 days after screening evaluations were completed, then repeat the following labs:  
o CBC, differential, platelets  
o Serum creatinine, phosphate 
o lipase, amylase  
o bilirubin, SGOT 
o PT, PTT 
o Fasting serum glucose and fasting lipid panel 
o Urinalysis with microanalysis ; UPC ratio must be obtained if urinalysis has >2+ 
protein.

 3.0 STUDY IMPLEMENTATION  
This is a phase 1 /[ADDRESS_321358] initiate study treatment within 96 hours after registration.  
All patients will be monitored for hematologic or serologic evidence of myelosuppression, hepatic 
injury, renal injury, and electrolyte disturbances and for clinical evidence of other toxicity as is 
described in section 3.5. 
 PHASE 1 STUDY DESIGN  
 Drug Administration  
Patients will be treated with daily everolimus (days 1 -28) in combination with sorafenib (as per 
the table below).   
The schedule providing highest dose without DLT (as defined above) will be used as the phase II 
dose.  The dose levels are listed in Table [ADDRESS_321359].  Patients may continue with protocol therapy until criteria for “Off Treatment” is met.  Off treatment criteria could be any of the following events/reasons; disease progression, intolerable side effects (toxicities) and/or withdrawal from study.  
 Dose Escalation  
Patients will be treated at the dose levels in Table [ADDRESS_321360] dose level (sorafenib 400 mg twice daily and everolimus 5 mg daily) the dose for the next cohort of patients will be decreased to sorafenib 400 mg twice daily 7 days on, 7 days off and everolimus 5 mg daily (dose level -1).  If dose level -1 is tolerated, dose escalations will occur along the “b” 
pathway (-1, 1b, 2b, 3b, 4b). 
If two DLTs are encountered at dose level 2, the dose for the next cohort of patients will be reduced 
to sorafenib 400 twice daily, 7 days on 7 days off and everolimus 7.5 mg daily (dose level 1b).  Subsequent dose escalations will occur along the “b” pathway (2, 1b, 2b, 3b, 4b). 
The study drugs will be self -administered (by  [CONTACT_36129]). The investigator will 
instruct the patient to take the study drug exactly as specified in the protocol. Patients will be 
instructed to take the study drugs in the morning, at the same time each day.  
The study drugs must be taken [ADDRESS_321361] be 
recorded.

1), and will be defined as the dose at which fewer than one -third of patients experience a DLT to 
one of the study drugs.  The MTD is the dose level at which 0/6 or 1/[ADDRESS_321363] 2/3 or 2/6 patients encountering DLT. Three patients will 
be treated at each dose level.  If one dose limiting toxicity (DLTs) is encountered an additional 3 patients will be added to that dose level.  If at any point two DLTs are encountered within a given dose level, then the MTD has been e xceeded and three more patients are treated at the next lower 
dose (if only three patients were previously treated at that prior dose). 
  Dose -Limiting Toxicity  
Toxicities will be graded according to the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0. If multiple toxicities are seen, the presence of DLT should be based on the 
most severe toxicity experienced. DLT will be defined as any of the following events occurring during treatment with sorafenib and/or everolimus and attributable to one of the study drugs: 
[IP_ADDRESS] Any grade 3 thrombocytopenia, grade 4 anemia, grade 4 neutropenia, or febrile 
neutropenia of any grade.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Any non-hematologic grade 3 or grade 4 toxicity, excluding alopecia and/or hand/foot reaction.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Failure to recover from toxicities (to grade 1 or less) to be eligible for re -treatment with 
sorafenib and everolimus within [ADDRESS_321364] dose of sorafenib and everolimus.

Version Date:  06/15/18  Page 23 of 99 
 
 PHASE II STUDY DESIGN  
 Drug Administration  
All p atients  treated on the phase II co horts will receive a combination of sorafenib (7 days on, 7 
days off) and everolimus daily over a 28-day cycle, as follows:  
Sorafenib 400 mg BID PO (days 1 -7 and days 15-21) 
Everolimus 5 mg PO  daily  (days 1 -28) 
There is not a defined set of maximum number of cycles that a patient may have.  Patients may 
continue with protocol therapy until criteria for “Off Treatment” is met.  See Section 3.7.1. 
 DOSE  MODIFICATIONS IN PHASE I (POST CYCLE 1) AND PHASE II 
Patients with stable or responding disease may be retreated at the same dose or at a reduced dose 
level, depending upon the adverse events observed in the current cycle and any adverse events (based on the CTCAE v.4) present on the first day of the next cycle. If multiple toxicities are seen, the dose administered in a subsequent cycle should be based on the most severe toxicity experienced in the current cycle.  
Patients who experience toxicity should have laboratory testing at least weekly until the toxicity has resolved. 
Toxicities will be graded according to the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 
(CTCAE) version 4.0. If multiple toxicities are seen, the toxicity should be based on the most 
severe toxicity experienced. Toxicities will be defined as any of the following events occurring during treatment with sorafenib and/or everolimus and attributable to one of the study drugs: 
A. Any grade 3 thrombocytopenia, grade 4 anemia, grade 4 neutropenia, or febrile neutropenia of any grade.  
B. Any non- hematologic grade 3 or grade 4 toxicity, excluding alopecia and/or 
hand/foot reaction. 
C. Failure to recover from grade 3 or 4 toxicities (to grade 1 or less) to be eligible 
for re -treatment with sorafenib a nd everolimus within [ADDRESS_321365] dose of 
sorafenib and everolimus.  
 Within Treatment Cycles   
If a patient experiences toxicities during a treatment cycle, the treatment will be immediately suspended until a grade 1 or less toxicity.  If the toxicity res olves to less than or equal to grade 1 
within 2 weeks, the patient will be retreated at the dose level described in Table 3-2 below . (Refer 
to Table 3-6 and Table 3-7 for management of everolimus -induced toxicities and Table 3-8, Table 
3-9 and Table 3-10 for management of sorafenib -induced toxicities .) If toxicity persists, the patient 
should be taken off study.  
Two dose reductions are permitted. Doses that are reduced for sorafenib or everolimus related 
toxicity will not be re -escalated, even if there is minimal or no toxicity with the reduced dose. 
Patients whose dose has been reduced for adverse events that are subsequently not felt to be related to sorafenib or everolimus may have the dos e re-escalated after completion of one cycle with 
toxicities less than or equal to grade 1. If any patient has further toxicities that would require additional reductions, or if treatment is held for more than 2 consecutive weeks because of ongoing

 Management of Hepatitis  
[IP_ADDRESS] Management of Hepatitis reactivation  
In cancer patients with hepatitis B, whether carriers or in chronic state, use of antivirals during 
anticancer therapy has been shown to reduce the risk of hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation and associated H BV morbidity and mortality (Loomba et al. 2008). 
[IP_ADDRESS].1 Monitoring and prophylactic treatment for hepatitis B reactivation  
Table  3-3 provides details of monitoring and prophylactic therapy according to the baseline results 
of viral load and serologic markers testing.

met (e.g. for a patient who was HBV -DNA positive on 01- JAN-10 and whose ALT reached ≥ 5 × 
ULN on 01- APR -10, the date of viral reactivation is 01- APR -10). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Monitoring for hepatitis C  
The following two categories of patients should be monitored every 4 weeks for HCV reactivation:  
Abbreviated Title: Ph 1/2 Everolimus & Sorafenib

 • Patients with detectable HCV RNA -PCR test at baseline.  
• Patients known to have a history of HCV infection, despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] a negative viral load 
test at baseline (including those that were treated and are considered ‘cured’)  
For definition of hepatitis C reactivation and the management guidelines, see 
Table 3-5 Guidelines for management of hepatitis C.

threatening by [CONTACT_093] ; in which case,  they should be recorded as grade 4 
(CTCAE v 4.0 Metabolic Laboratory/Other: Viral Re -activation ). 
 Management of stomatitis/oral mucositis/mouth ulcers   
CTC AE v 4.0 grade 1 -2 stomatitis/oral mucositis/mouth ulcers due to everolimus should l ead to 
using local supportive care such as use of mouthwash (avoid those containing alcohol). The use of topi[INVESTIGATOR_264262] 0.1% (Kenalog in Orabase®) is allowed. Please refer to section  [IP_ADDRESS] for dose modifications.  Suggested guidelines for treatment 
of stomatitis/oral mucositis/mouth ulcers: 
1.  For mild toxicity (grade 1), use  conservative measures such as non -alcoholic mouth 
wash or salt water (0.9%) mouth wash several times a day until resolution. 
2.  For more severe toxicity (grade [ADDRESS_321374] pain but are able to maintain adequate oral alimentation, or grade 3 in which case patients cannot maintain 
adequate oral alimentation), the suggested treatments are topi[INVESTIGATOR_032] (e.g.,  local anesthetics such as benzocaine, butyl aminobenzoate, tetracaine 
hydrochloride, menthol, or phenol) with or without topi[INVESTIGATOR_11930], such as 
triamcinolone oral paste 0.1% (Kenalog in Orabase®). 
Abbreviated Title: Ph 1/2 Everolimus & Sorafenib  
Version Date:  06/15/[ADDRESS_321375] be avoided unless a fungal infection is diagnosed. In 
particular, systemic imidazole antifungal agents (ketoconazole, fluconazole, 
itraconazole, etc.)  should be avoided in all patients due to their strong inhibition of 
everolimus and sorafenib metabolism, therefore leading to higher everolimus 
exposures. Therefore, topi[INVESTIGATOR_033].  Similarly, antiviral agents such as acyclovir should be avoided unless a viral infection is diagnosed. 
 Note: S tomatitis/oral mucositis  should be appropriately graded using the functional 
grading given on the NCI- CTC AE, version 4.0. 
  Management of hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_264263].  Treatment of hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_89383] -
treatmen t status and dietary habits. Blood tests to monitor hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_264264]. Grade 2 or higher hypercholesterolemia (>300 mg/dL or 7.75 mmol/L) or grade 2 or higher hypertriglyceridemia (>2.5 x upper normal limit) should be treate d with a statin or 
appropriate lipid- lowering medication, in addition to diet. Patients should be monitored clinically 
and through serum biochemistry for the development of rhabdomyolysis and other adverse events as required in the product label/data sheet s for HMG -CoA reductase inhibitors. Please refer to 
section [IP_ADDRESS] fo r dose modifications of everolimus. 
Note: Concomitant therapy with fibrates and an HMG -CoA reductase inhibitor is associated with 
an increased risk of a rare but serious skeletal muscle toxicity manifested by [CONTACT_090], markedly elevated creatine kinase (CPK) levels and myoglobinuria, acute renal failure and sometimes death. The risk versus benefit of using this therapy should be determined for individual 
patients based on their risk of cardiovascular complications of hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035].

initiation of everolimus treatment  
Toxicity Actions  
Non-hematological toxicity   
Grade 2  
(except pneumonitis – refer to Table 3-6) If the toxicity is tolerable to the 
patient, maintain the same dose.  If 
the toxicity is intolerable to patient, interrupt everolimus until r ecovery 
to grade ≤1. Then reintroduce 
everolimus at same dose.  
If event returns to grade 2, then interrupt everolimus until recovery 
to grade ≤1. Then reintroduce 
everolimus at same dose level.  
Grade 3  
(except hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035]*)  
(except pneumonitis – refer to Table 3-6) Interrupt everolimus until recovery 
to grade ≤1. Then reintroduce 
everolimus at same dose level. For 
pneumonitis consider the use of a 
short course of corticosteroids.  
Grade 4  Discontinue everolimus.  
Hematological toxicity   
Grade 2 Thrombocytopenia (platelets <75, ≥ 50x10
9/L)  Interrupt everolimus until recovery 
to grade ≤1 (>75 x109/L). Then 
reintroduce everolimus at initial 
dose. 
If thrombocytopenia again returns to grade 2, interrupt everolimus 
until recovery to grade ≤ 1. Then 
reintroduce everolimus at same dose 
level.  
Grade 3 Thrombocytopenia (platelets <50, ≥ 25 x109/L) Interrupt everolimus until recovery 
to grade ≤1 (platelets ≥ 75 x109/L).  
Then resume everolimus at same 
dose level.  If grade 3 thrombocytopenia recurs, 
discontinue everolimus.  
Grade 4 Thrombocytopenia (platelets < 25 
x109/L) Discontinue everolimus.

 Hypertension: Dose Modifications of Sorafenib for Hypertension 
Hypertension is a known and potentially serious adverse event associated with sorafenib treatment. 
Patients will have their blood pressure monitored and recorded weekly during the Cycle 1 and then 
every cycle of the entire treatment period, either at the doctor’s offic e or by [CONTACT_264333] (such as those found at a local drug store or pharmacy). Patients will have a Blood Pressure Diary on which to record the measurements, which will be kept with research chart. If the patient’s blood pressure is elevated at any time (>140/100), even outside clinic visits, they should contact [CONTACT_24018].

 QUESTIONNAIRES  
The MDASI -BT will be utilized for this portion of the study. Full instruments are provided in the 
Appendix 13.4.  In addition, information regarding demographics and treatment history will be 
collected as part of the larger study and used in this analysis.    
Abbreviated Title: Ph 1/2 Everolimus & Sorafenib  
Version Date:  06/15/18  Page 35 of 99 
 The MDASI -BT consists of 23 symptoms rated on an 11- point scale (0 to 10) to indicate the 
presence and severity of the symptom, with 0 being “not present” and 10 being “as bad as you can 
imagine.” Each symptom is rated at its worst in the last 24 ho urs. Symptoms included on the 
instrument include those commonly associated with cancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], those associated with increased intracranial pressure, and those related to focal deficits.  The questionnaire also includes ratings of how much symptoms inte rfered with different aspects of a patient’s life in the last 24 
hours. These interference items include: general activity, mood, work (includes both work outside the home and housework), relations with other people, walking, and enjoyment of life. The interference items are also measured on 0 - 10 scales. The average time to complete these 
instruments is 5 minutes. The MDASI -BT has been translated into 18 languages ( 24, 25
).

serum lipid panel and urinalysis/urine dipstick will be performed every four weeks (+/ -
3 days) prior to each cycle.  If > 2+ protein is present on urine dipstick/urinalysis, then 
UPC  should be obtained. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Brain MRI/CT  
[IP_ADDRESS].1 A brain MRI/CT will be done monthly x 2 then every other month, within 7 days of new cycle.   
OR 
[IP_ADDRESS].2 For Phase II patients enrolled to the bevacizumab failure cohort, MRI/CT will be 
done every 4 weeks x 4, then every 8 weeks thereafter, within 7 days of new cycle.  
Note:  *MRI is the preferable imaging method, CT scan may be used in cases where an MRI cannot 
be obtained.   
[IP_ADDRESS] All relevant information regarding drug doses, concomitant medications, and doses, 
measurable lesions with measurements, tumor response, laboratory examinations, and treatment -related toxicities shall be documented in the patient’s medical record and 
flow sheets . 
[IP_ADDRESS] A complete physical exam (with vital signs) and neurologic exam (to include 
documentation of the patients Karnofsky Performance Status) will be performed monthly. The MDASI -BT will be completed at baseline and at the time of each 
evaluation that includes an imaging study.  
[IP_ADDRESS] The patient will complete the MDASI -BT ( Appendi x 13.4) at the time of clinical 
evaluation with MRI as long as the clinical therapy is being administered, unless clinical  deterioration makes self -report not possible before that time.  The time when 
patients are unable to complete the self -report questionnaires will be used as part of the 
study analysis.  The MDASI -BT will be completed only by [CONTACT_102], unless changes 
in vision or weakness make this difficult. If this occurs, then the caregiver or research 
Abbreviated Title: Ph 1/2 Everolimus & Sorafenib  
Version Date:  06/15/[ADDRESS_321387] with marking the severity 
number or score as described by [CONTACT_102]. A patient caregiver may complete the questionnaires as a patient -preference proxy if the patient’s deficits preclude self -
report.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Patients on antiviral prophylaxis  treatment or positive HBV antibodies should be tested 
for HBV -DNA on Cycle 1 Day 1 and Day 1 of all subsequent cycles (every 28 day s) 
to monitor for re -activation. If re -activation is confirmed, everolimus must be 
interrupted or discontinued according to the guidance in Table 6- 3. Patients with 
positive HCV RNA- PCR results at screening and/or a history of past infection (even if 
treated and considered ‘cured’) should have HCV RNA- PCR testing performed on 
Cycle 1 Day 1 and Day 1 of all subsequent cycles (every 28 days) to monitor for reactivation. Everolimus must be discontinued if HCV reactivation is confirmed according to the guidance in Table 3-5.  
[IP_ADDRESS] All patients will be followed for overall survival, when possible. 
a) Patients who discontinue treatment due to progression will be followed for survival every 3 months by [CONTACT_33982].  
b) Patients who come off therapy for reasons other than progression should be followed until progression or institution of new anti -tumor therapy.  They should then be 
followed for survival. 
 Phase I Requirements  
[IP_ADDRESS] Phase I patients will be evaluated for adverse events at least weekly during their first cycle of therapy (by [CONTACT_264338]). These adverse events will be reported to the Lead PI  [INVESTIGATOR_264269].  
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse ev ents for subsequent cycles will be reported to BTTC Coordinating Center  at 
the end of each cycle. In addition all serious adverse events will be reported to the 
BTTC Coordinating Center and the Lead PI , as directed in section  6.4  
 Phase II Requirements  
[IP_ADDRESS] Phase II patients will be evaluated for adverse events at the end of each cycle. In 
addition, all serious adverse events will be reported to the BTTC Coordinating Center  
and the Lead PI  [INVESTIGATOR_264270]  6.[ADDRESS_321388] be recorded on the appropriate follow up case report form.

 4.0 CONCOMITANT MEDICATIONS/MEASURES  
 G-CSF Administration: Routine prophylactic use of G -CSF is not permitted. However, 
therapeutic use in patients with serious neutropenic complications, such as sepsis, may 
be considered at the investigator’s discretion. 
 Corticosteroids should be used in the smallest dose to control symptoms of cerebral 
edema and mass eff ect, and discontinued if possible.  Patients must not be on a 
dexamethasone dose of greater than 16 mg/ day. 
 Anti-seizure medications  should be used as indicated. If for unavoidable clinical reasons 
(severe allergies, toxicities etc.) a patients AED is switched to the alternate AED group the following guidelines must be followed: 
EVERY EFFORT SHOULD BE MADE TO MAINTAIN THE PATIENT ON NON -EIAED  
Patients, who were previously on a non- EIAED and need to change anticonvulsants, should be 
started on another non-EIAED if at all possible. No delays in treatment would be required. 
Patients who were previously on a non - EIAED and were inadvertently and temporarily changed 
to an EIAED, should immediately be started on another non- EIAED. The patient may continue the 
current treatment dose while a non - EIAED is re -started.  
Patients who were previously on a non -EIAED and need to permanently change anticonvulsant, 
but who cannot change to another non- EIAED may continue the current treatment dose for the 
next [ADDRESS_321389] BE DI SCUSSED 
WITH THE  STUDY CHAIR . In some cases this dose may be higher than the previously used 
dose. 
 Febrile neutropenia  may be managed according to the local institution's Infectious 
Disease guidelines.  Measures may include appropriate laboratory testing, including 
blood and urine cultures and the institution of broad- spectrum antibi otics.  If a source for 
the fever is not identified or the fever resolves when the neutrophil count recovers, antibiotics may be discontinued and the patient observed. 
 Antiemetics : The use of antiemetics will be left to the investigators’ discretion.  
 Other  Concomitant Medications : Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_264271]-being  of 
the patient may be given at the discretion of the investigator. Other concomitant 
medications should be avoided except for analgesics, chronic treatments for concomitant medical  conditions, or agents required for life -threatening medical problems.  All 
concomitant medications must be recorded. 
 Other Anticancer or Experimental Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] : No other anticancer therapy (including 
chemotherapy, radiation, hormonal treatment or immunotherapy) of any kind is permitted  during the study period. No other drug under investigation may be used 
concomitantly with the study drug. 
 Surgery : If neurosurgical management is required for reasons not due to tumor 
progression, these procedures must be documented, including the indications for surgery, the surgical operative note and pathology report. If possible , defer surgery for [ADDRESS_321390] dose of therapy.  Patients who undergo resection for presumed tumor

investigator, associate investigators/research nurses and/or a contracted data man ager will assist 
with the data management efforts.  
Data on this study will be entered into C3D  and Scribe/Labmatrix .  Designated research staff from 
the registering institution will enter the data via remote electronic data entry. The protocol specific 
electronic forms are to be used by [CONTACT_16529].  All investigators will utilize these forms 
for Baseline, Treatment, Adverse Events, Tumor Evaluation, Off Treatment, Survival, and Off -
study data.  
All data obtained during the conduct of the protocol will be kept in secure network drives or in 
approved alternative sites that comply with NIH security standards. Primary and final analyzed data will have identifiers so that research data can be attributed to an individual human subject participant.   
All AEs, including clinically significant abnormal findings on laboratory evaluations, regardless 
of severity, will be followed until return to baseline or stabilization of event . Serious adverse events 
that occur more than [ADDRESS_321393] administration of investigational agent/intervention and have an attribution of at least possibly related to the agent/intervention should be recorded and reported as per Sections 6.3 and 6.5. 
An abnormal laboratory value will be recorded in the database as an AE only if the laboratory 
abnormality is characterized by [CONTACT_39132]:  
• Results in discontinuation from the study 
• Is associated with clinical signs or symptoms  
• Requires treatment or any other therapeutic intervention  
• Is associated with death or another serious adverse event, including hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
• Is judged by [CONTACT_264342], the investigator will provide details about the action taken with respect to the test drug and about the patient’s outcome.

 Confidentiality  
All documents, investigative reports, or information relating to the patient are strictly confidential. 
Any patient specific reports (i.e. Pathology Reports, MRI Reports, Operative Reports, etc.) submitted to the BTTC Coordinating Center  must have the patient’s full name & social security 
number “blacked out” and the assigned patient ID number and protocol number written in. Patient 
initials may be included or retained for cross verification of identification.  
 Safety Data  
All patients receiving study agents will be evaluated for safety.  The safety parameters include all 
laboratory tests and hematological abnormalities, CNS observations, physical examination findings, and spontaneous reports of adverse events reported to the investigator by [CONTACT_1962].  All 
toxicities encountered during the study will be evaluated according  to the NCI Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 and recorded prior to each course of therapy.  Life-threatening toxicities that are unexpected and assessed to be possibly related to 
the study agent/s should be reported immediately as per Section 6.5.   
Information about all adverse events, whether volunteered by [CONTACT_423], discovered by [CONTACT_424], or detected through physical examination, laboratory test or other means, will be collected and recorded on the Adverse Event Case Report Form and followed as appropriate. An adverse event is any undesirable sign, symptom or medical condition occurring after starting study drug (or therapy) even if the event is not considered to be related to study drug.  
Medical conditions/diseases present before starting study treatment are only considered adverse events if they worsen after starting study treatment (any procedures specified in the protocol). Adverse events occurring before starting study treatment but after signing the informed consent form are recorded on the Baseline Evaluations  Case Repor t Form.  Abnormal laboratory values or 
test results constitute adverse events only if they induce clinical signs or symptoms or require therapy, and are also recorded on the Adverse Events Case Report Form. 
 Data Sharing with Pharmaceutical Collaborators, Ba yer and [COMPANY_001] 
NCI may share data from this study with pharmaceutical collaborators, Bayer and [COMPANY_001], pursuant to the NCI M -CRADAs with each company. Specifically, the collaborators may access 
and review analytical results and primary quantitative and  empi[INVESTIGATOR_264273] M- CRADAs.  
 RESPONSE CRITERIA  
The primary efficacy endpoint for BTTC studies will be progression free survival (PFS) at six months from patient registration for bevacizumab naïve patients and at [ADDRESS_321396] images when possible, althoug h coronal images may be used if axial is not optimal for measurements (or CT post contrast 
if MRI is contraindicated).  The same plane should be used for all measurements.  Tumor size is defined as the largest (contrast enhancing) cross sectional area (lar gest cross- sectional diameter x 
largest diameter perpendicular to it).   
• Evaluable for toxicity: All patients will be evaluated for toxicity from the time of their first 
treatment with Sorafenib or Everolimus. 
Abbreviated Title: Ph 1/2 Everolimus & Sorafenib  
Version Date:  06/15/18  Page 44 of 99 
 • Evaluable for objective response: Only those patients who have measurable disease present at 
baseline, have received at least one cycle of therapy, and have had their disease re- evaluated 
will be considered evaluable for response.  These patients will have their response classified 
according to the d efinitions stated below.  (Note:  Patients who exhibit objective disease 
progression prior to the end of cycle 1 will also be considered evaluable.) 
 
 Definitions of Response 
[IP_ADDRESS] Measurable Disease:  Bi-dimensionally measurable CE lesions with clearly defined 
margins by [CONTACT_28842], with a minimal diameter of [ADDRESS_321397] or surgical cavity, if necessary, requires a minimum thickness of 3 mm. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Non-measurable Disease (contrast enhancing):  Uni-dimensionally measurable lesions, 
masses with margins not clearly defined, lesions with maximal diameter < 1 cm.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Objective Status, To Be Recorded at Each Eval uation: If there are too many measurable 
lesions to measure at each evaluation, choose the largest two to be followed before a patient is entered on study.  The remaining lesions will be considered evaluable for the purpose of objective status determination.  Unless progression is observed, objective status can only be determined when ALL measurable and evaluable sites and lesions are assessed.  
[IP_ADDRESS].1 Complete Response (CR)   
Complete disappearance of all CE measurable and evaluable disease.  No new lesions.  No evidence of non -evaluable disease.  All measurable, evaluable and non -evaluable lesions and sites 
must be assessed using the same techniques as baseline.  Patients must be on no steroids.  There must be stable or improved non- enhancing (T2/FLAIR) lesions.  Stable or improved clinically.  
Note:  Patients with non -measurable disease cannot have a partial response.  The best possible 
response is stable disease.  
[IP_ADDRESS].2 Partial Response (PR)   
Greater than or equal to 50% decrease under baseline in the sum of products of perpendicular diameters of the two largest CE measurable lesions, sustained for at least [ADDRESS_321398] 8 weeks from initiation of therapy.   Stable or improved non- enhancing (T2/FLAIR) lesions 
on same or lower dose of corticosteroids compared to baseline.  Stable or improved clinically.  
Note:  Patients with non -measurable disease cannot have a partial response.  The best response 
possible is stable disease.  
[IP_ADDRESS].3 Partial Response, Non- Measurable (PRNM)  
 Not applicable.  
[IP_ADDRESS].4 Stable/No Response  
Abbreviated Title: Ph 1/2 Everolimus & Sorafenib  
Version Date:  06/15/[ADDRESS_321399] be assessed using the same 
techniques as baseline.  Stable non- enhancing (T2/FLAIR) lesions on same or lower dose of 
steroids as compared to the baseline scan.  In the event that the steroid dose has been increased, the last scan considered to show stable disease will be the scan obtained when the corticosteroid dose was equivalent to the baseline dose.   
[IP_ADDRESS].5 Progression  
a.   >25% increase in the sum of products of perpendicular diameters of enhancing 
lesions (over baseline if no decrease) on stable or increasing dose of corticosteroids.  
and/or 
b.  Significant increase in T2/FLAIR non-enhancing  lesion on stable or increasing 
doses of corticosteroids compared to baseline scan or best response following 
initiation or therapy, not due to co- morbid events (radiation therapy, demyelination, 
ischemic injury, infection, seizures, postoperative changes, or other treatment effects).  
c.  Any new lesio n 
d.  Clear clinical deterioration not attributable to other causes apart from the tumor (e.g., seizures, medication side effects, complications of therapy, cerebrovascular 
events, infection, etc.).  The definition of clinical deterioration is left to the 
discretion of the treating physician, but it is recommended that a decrease in 20% of KPS or from any baseline to 50% or less be considered, unless attributable to comorbid events. 
e.  Failure to re turn for evaluation due to death or deteriorating condition. 
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_321400] response 
or increasing disease and if all objective status determinatio ns before progression are unknown. 
 Neurological Exam   
Although not used for determining response, it is useful to evaluate improvement in the neurologic exam, (as compared to the baseline assessment), that should coincide with objective measurement of tumor size.

 Performance Status:  
Patients will be graded according to Karnofsky Performance St atus (see  Appendix 13.1).  
 Time to Treatment Failure :  
From date of registration to the date of first observation of progressive disease (as defined in 
Section 5.2.1),  non- reversible neurologic progression or permanently increased steroid 
requirement (applies to stable disease only), death due to any cause, or early discontinuation of treatment. If a pati ent is registered on the pre -operative portion of the study, the start date for 
calculation of time to event will be the date of first post-operative study drug administration. 
 Time to Death   
From date of registration to date of death due to any cause. 
 Evaluability    
Patients are required to receive at least 2 weeks of treatment of both agents , and the protocol 
defined evaluations are performed per protocol  to be considered evaluable.  Inevaluable patients 
will be replaced.     
 TOXICITY CRITERIA  
The following adverse event management guidelines are intended to ensure the safety of each patient while on the study.  The descriptions and grading scales found in the revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.[ADDRESS_321401] access to a copy of the CTCAE version 
4.0.  A copy of the CTCAE version 4.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP web site 
(http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm#ctc_40

6.0 SAFETY REPORTING REQUIREMENTS/DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING PLAN  
 DEFINITIONS  
 Adverse Event  
Any untoward medical occurrence in a human subject, including any abnormal sign (for example, abnormal physical exam or laboratory finding), symptom, or disease, temporally associated with the subject’s participation in research, whether or not considered related to the subject’s 
participation in the research.  
 Suspected adverse reaction  
Suspected adverse reaction means any adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility 
that the drug caused the adverse event. For the purposes of IND safety reporting, ‘reasonable possibility’ means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the adverse event. A suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction,  which means any adverse event caused by a drug.  
Abbreviated Title: Ph 1/2 Everolimus & Sorafenib  
Version Date:  06/15/18  Page 47 of 99 
 
 Unexpected adverse reaction  
An adverse event  or suspected adverse reaction is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in the 
investigator brochure or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has  been observed; or, if an 
investigator brochure is not required or available, is not consistent with the risk information 
described in the general investigational plan or elsewhere in the current application. "Unexpected” also refers to adverse events or suspected adverse reactions that are mentioned in the investigator brochure as occurring with a class of drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not specifically mentioned as occurring with the particular drug under investigation.  
 Serious  
An U nanticipated Problem or Protocol D eviation  is serious if it meets the definition of a Serious 
Adverse Event  or if it compromises the safety, welfare or rights of subjects or others. 
 Serious Adverse Event 
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered serious if in the view of the investigator or the sponsor, it results in any of the following: 
• Death,  
• A life -threatening adverse drug experience  
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• Persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal 
life functions 
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
• Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a serious adverse drug experience when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. 
 Disability  
A substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions. 
 Life-threatening adverse drug experience  
Any adverse event or suspected adverse reaction  that places the patient or subject, in the view of 
the investigator  or sponsor , at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred, i.e., it does 
not include a reaction that had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death. 
 Protocol Deviation  (NIH Definition)  
Any change, divergence, or departure from the IRB -approved research protocol.   
 Non-compliance (NIH Definition)  
The failure to comply with applicable NIH Human Research Protections Program ( HRPP ) policies, 
IRB requirements, or regulatory requirements for the protection of human research subjects. 
Abbreviated Title: Ph 1/2 Everolimus & Sorafenib  
Version Date:  06/15/18  Page 48 of 99 
 
 Unanticipated Problem 
Any incident , experience, or outcome that: 
•  Is unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency in relation to  
(a) the research risks that are described in the IRB -approved research protocol and 
informed consent document; Investigator’s Brochure or other study documents, and 
(b) the characteristics of the subject population being studied; AND  
• Is related or possibly related to participation in the research; AND  
• Suggests that the resear ch places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm  (including 
physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or 
recognized.  
 ASSESSING CA[LOCATION_003]LITY  
Investigators are required to assess whether there is a reasonable possibility that the study agent/s caused or contributed to an adverse event.  The following general guidance may be used. 
Yes: If the temporal relationship of the clinical event to the study agent/s administration 
makes a causal relationship possible, and other drugs, therapeutic interventions or underlying conditions do not provide a sufficient explanation for the observed event. 
No: If the temporal relationship of the clinical event to the study agent/s administration 
makes a causal relationship unlikely, or other drugs, therapeutic interventions or underlying 
conditions provide a sufficient explanation for the observed event. 
 NCI-IRB AND CLINICAL DIRECTOR REPORTING  
 NCI-IRB and NCI CD Expedited Reporting of Unanticipated Problems and Deaths  
The Lead  PI [INVESTIGATOR_264274]- IRB and NCI Clinical Director : 
• All deaths, except deaths due to progressive disease  
• All Protocol Deviations  
• All Unanticipated Problems  
• All non- compliance  
Reports must be received within 7 days of PI [INVESTIGATOR_10039].  
 NCI-IRB Requirements for PI [INVESTIGATOR_264275] -IRB:  
1. A summary of all protocol deviations in a tabular format to include the date the deviation occurred, a brief description of the deviation and any corrective action. 
2. A summary of any instances of non -compliance  
3. A tabular summary of the following adverse events: 
• All Grade 2 unexpected  events that are possibly, probably or definitely related to the 
research;  
Abbreviated Title: Ph 1/2 Everolimus & Sorafenib  
Version Date:  06/15/18  Page 49 of 99 
 • All Grade 3 and 4 events that are possibly, probably or definitely related to the research;  
• All Grade 5 events regardless of attribution;  
• All Serious Events regardless of attribution.  
NOTE : Grade [ADDRESS_321402] for waiver from IRB reporting: Anticipated Protocol Deviations  
Brief interruption and delay in the 28- day cycle may occasionally be required due to travel delays, 
airport closure, inclement weather, family responsibilities, security alerts and government 
holidays, etc. This can also extend to complications of dis ease not attributable to disease 
progression or protocol therapy. These delays will not be considered protocol deviations. We 
expect 1 -2 anticipated delays per patient.   However, any interruption more than 14 calendar days 
will not be permitted.  
If the rat e of these events exceeds the rate  of more than 2 anticipated  delays per patient,  the events 
will be classified and reported as though they are unanticipated problems.

 GUIDELINES & PROCEDURES FOR REPORT ING DEVIATIONS AND UNANTICIPATED 
PROBLEMS  
 Neither the FDA nor the ICH GCP guidelines define the terms “protocol violation” or “protocol 
deviation.”  The definition is often left t o the Lead Institution IRB.  Accordingly, since NCI, Center 
Abbreviated Title: Ph 1/2 Everolimus & Sorafenib  
Version Date:  06/15/[ADDRESS_321409]. Definitions  are listed in section 6.1. 
Protocol Deviations or Unanticipated problems occurring at a participating institution will be submitted to that institution’s own IRB in accordance with local policies and procedures.   However, the participating institution must submit a report to the BTTC Coordinating Center even in instances where the local IRB does not require a report.  
Deviations or Unanticipated Problems must be submitted to the BTTC Coordinating Center  within 
5 business  calendar days after becoming aware of the event (if not reportable to the local IRB . 
When Deviations or Unanticipated Problems are reported to BTTC, but, the local IRB does not require a report, the report that is submitted to the BTTC Coordinating Center  must be 
accompanied by a formal memo explaining the local policy and the rationale for not reporting the 
event to the local IRB.  
Deviation or Unanticipated Problem Reports and any accompanying documentation (to include 
the local IRB acknowledgement of the event when applicable) ar e to be submitted to the  BTTC

NCI Center for Cancer Research Coordinating Center:   Upon receipt of the deviation/unanticipated 
problem report from the participating institution, the BTTC  Coordinating Center will submit the 
report to the Lead Principal Investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_96294]. Subsequently, the participating institution’s 
IRB deviation/unanticipated problem report will be submitted to the NCI IRB for review. 
 DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING PLAN 
 Principal Investigator/Research Team  
The clinical research team will have a teleconference every other week when patients are being actively treated on the trial to discuss each patient. Decisions about dose level enrollment and dose escalation if applicable will be made based on the toxi city data from prior patients.  
All data will be collected in a timely manner and reviewed by [CONTACT_1716][INVESTIGATOR_1660] [INVESTIGATOR_1660] a lead 
associate investigator. Adverse events will be reported as required above. Any safety concerns, new information that might affect either the ethical and or scien tific conduct of the trial, or protocol 
deviations will be immediately reported to the IRB using iRIS.

 BTT C Coordinating Center Monitoring Plan 
As the CCR is the coordinating center for this multi- site study, the CCR to maintain a monitoring 
program. The CCR’s program allows for confirmation of: study data, specifically data that could affect the interpretation of primary study endpoints; adherence to the protocol, regulations, and SOPs; and human subjects protection. This is done through independent verification of study data with source documentation focusing on: 
Abbreviated Title: Ph 1/2 Everolimus & Sorafenib  
Version Date:  06/15/18  Page 54 of 99 
 • Informed consent process 
• Eligibility confirmation  
• Drug administration and accountability 
• Adverse events monitoring 
• Response assessment.  
The monitoring  program also extends to multi -site research when the CCR is the coordinating 
center.  
This trial will be monitored by [CONTACT_264347]. Monitors are qualified 
by [CONTACT_12293]. Per sonnel monitoring this 
study will not be affiliated in any way with the trial conduct.  
 Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC)  
This protocol will require oversight from the Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC).  Initial review will occur as soon as possible after the annual NCI -IRB continuing review date.   Subsequently, 
each protocol will be reviewed as close to annually as the quarterly meeting schedule permits or more frequently as may be required by [CONTACT_4484].   For initial and subsequent reviews, protocols will not be reviewed if there is no accrual within the review period. Written outcome letters will be generated in response to the monitoring activities and submitted to the Principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_74837], CCR, NCI.

chance (70%, 17%) of dose escalating when the true toxicity rate for that dose is 10% (30%, 50%).  It is expected that up to 6 dose combination will be observed, so that the expected sample size will range from 6 (if unacceptable toxicities are seen at the lowest doses) to 36 (if 6 patients per cohort are required for all 6 cohorts). 
 PHASE II COMPONENT    
Time to progression and overall survival will be evaluated using the Kaplan- Meier product -limit 
survival curve methodology.  Six -month Progression Free Survival (PFS) will be estimated using 
Kaplan -Meier estimates and associated two -sided 95% confidence intervals.   
 Group A :  Recurrent glioblastoma with no prior exposure to bevacizumab cohort:  
A maximum of [ADDRESS_321412] stage, 9 patients will be accrued.   If two or more patients are progress ion-free 
at 6 months (PFS6), an additional [ADDRESS_321413] PFS6, then the study will be declared 
Abbreviated Title: Ph 1/2 Everolimus & Sorafenib  
Version Date:  06/15/18  Page 55 of 99 
 promising.  This study has a 5% chance of declaring promise if the PFS6 rate is at most 
15%.  It has an 80% chance of declaring promise if the PFS rate is at least 35%.  
 Group B :  Recurrent glioblastoma with prior exposure to bevacizumab cohort:  In 
the group that failed bevacizumab, a maximum of [ADDRESS_321414] stage, 14 patients will be accrued.  If one or 
more patients is progression -free at 3 months (PFS3), an additional [ADDRESS_321415]  PFS3 , then the study will be declared 
promising.  This study  has a 5% chance of declaring promise if the PFS3 rate is at most 
1%.  It has an 80% chance of declaring promise if the PFS rate is at least 12%.  
 Group C :  A third cohort consisting of 16 patients with anaplastic glioma (as defined 
in section [IP_ADDRESS]) will enroll independently but will not be included in the primary 
endpoint assessment. 
The Phase II Multicenter component of the trial will be monitored by [CONTACT_64362] , Jeffrey 
Raizer , MD, and the study statistician, Yuan Ying PhD, as described below. 
At phase II, we will  monitor the toxicity based on the combined data from the above three cohorts 
with a total sample size of 82.  All grade [ADDRESS_321416] 28 -day cycle will be counted. Accrual will be temporarily suspended for analysis after 
each of the following interim accrual goals. We will monitor the toxicity  when the accrual is 5, 10, 
20, 35, 50 and 65 based on using the following stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1877]:  if the posterior probability  of toxicity 
greater than 0.3 is greater than 0.95 (i.e., Pr(toxicity>0.3|data) >0.95), we terminate the study for 
toxicity. Assuming the beta prior Beta(0.6, 1.4) for the toxicity, we have the following operati ng 
characteristics .  
Operating characteristics of the proposed stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_264287]  0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 
Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_264288]  1.4% 14.1% 64.6% 97.2% 
Average number of patients treated  82 74.9 49.9 24.9 
 
We obtain the following stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3106]: the study will be terminated if we observe >= 4/5, 
6/10, 10/20, 16/35, 21/50, 26/65 (# of patients experienced DLTs/# of patients treated).  Note that 
our safety monitoring starts with a small cohort size of 5, and then gradually increases to 15. 
Therefore, if the treatment agents are overly toxic, the trial will stop before exposing many patients to toxicities.  
Patient -reported outcomes:   The sample size for this trial was based on the primary end point of 
the stu dy. 
Received MDASI -BT forms will be checked versus the timing schedule and considered as valid if 
they fall within ten days of the scheduled assessment.  Compliance rates will be calculated as the number of received valid forms over the number of expected forms. Differences between groups 
in compliance will be tested by [CONTACT_264348]’s exact test at every time point.  
We will use descriptive statistics to describe how patients rate symptom severity and interference with function at each time point.  Error bar graphs for each of the symptoms will be constructed at 
Abbreviated Title: Ph 1/2 Everolimus & Sorafenib  
Version Date:  06/15/18  Page 56 of 99 
 each time point.  The proportion of patients rating their symptoms to be 7 or greater (on a 0-10 
scale) will also be reported.  We will construct individual patient profiles for each of the selected symptoms to describe the individual patients’ patterns of change over time. We will calculate the mean core symptom severity, mean severity of the MDASI -BT and mean symptom interference at 
the time of clinical evaluation. Estimates of differences in the me an symptom severity and mean 
symptom interference between responders and non- responders will be estimated in the intent to 
treat population.  All patients with at least one valid questionnaire will be included in the analyses.  Questionnaires completed at study registration will be considered baseline.  All questionnaire data received after randomization will be used in the primary analyses.  
Differences of at least [ADDRESS_321417] (CDA #[ZIP_CODE]- 17).  In addition, there is an 
executed CRADA agreement with [COMPANY_001]  (#[ZIP_CODE]) and an executed CRADA with Bayer 
(#[ZIP_CODE]) who support this study.  9.[ADDRESS_321418] SELECTION  
This study was  designed to include women and minorities, but was not designed to measure 
differences of intervention effects.  Males and females will be recruited with no preference to 
gender.  No exclusion to this study will be based on race.  Minorities will actively be recruited to 
participate.   High grade gliomas occur in patients of all races and although there is a slight 
predominance in men, this is a disease that is also common in women.  The molecular targets of the everolimus and sorafenib within the tumor are not known to be different among patients based on gender or race; hence this study will be open to all adults. 
 PARTICIPATION OF CHILDREN  
Individuals under the age of [ADDRESS_321419] glioblastoma , and because of unknown toxicities of the  study agent s in the 
pediatric patient.   Furthermore, the targets of the everolimus and sorafenib are not as prevalent in 
pediatric malignant gliomas and therefore, the efficacy of this regimen will be initially determined in the adult population before consideration of its use in pediatrics. 
 PARTICIPATION OF SUBJECTS UNABLE TO GIVE CONSENT (NCI)  
For adults who are or may be unable to consent: All research protocols should state whether adults who are unable to provide initial informed consent are excluded or are eligible to enroll, and the conditions, if any, under which adults who lose the ability to provide on-going consent subsequent to giving initial consent, may continue to participate.  
Abbreviated Title: Ph 1/2 Everolimus & Sorafenib  
Version Date:  06/15/[ADDRESS_321420] bene fit from 
research participation (section 9.6.3), all subjects ≥ age 18 will be offered the opportunity to fill in their wishes for research and care, and assign a substitute decision maker on the “NIH Advance Directive for Health Care and Medical Research Participation” form so that another person can make decisions about their medical care in the event that they become incapacitated or cognitively impaired during the course of the study. Note: The PI [INVESTIGATOR_62494] (ACAT)  for evaluation as needed for the following: an 
independent assessment of whether an individual has the capacity to provide consent; assistance in identifying and assessing an appropriate surrogate when indicated; and/or an assessment of the capacity to appoint a surrogate.  For those subjects that become incapacitated and do not have pre-determined substitute decision maker, the procedures described in MAS Policy 87-4 f and 
NIH HRPP SOP 14E or appointing a surrogate decision maker for adult subjects who are (a) 
decisionally impaired, and (b) who do not have a legal guardian or durable power of attorney, will be followed.  
 PARTICIPATION OF SUBJECTS UNABLE TO GIVE CONSENT (BTTC)  
Each institution will follow their own procedure for re-consenting subjects unable to re-consent and will notify the Coordinating Center at time of continuing review of these occurrences.  At time of  Amendment C, Version 10-04-2017, subjects enrolled at non- NCI sites are off 
treatment.  
 EVALUATION OF BENEFITS AND RISKS/DISCOMFORTS  
The primary risk to patients participating in this research study is from the toxicity of sorafenib, 
everolimus , or both drugs.  Both are  investigational agents in the treatment of gliomas, although 
bevacizumab is an FDA -approved drug for the treatment of colorectal carcinoma.  The protocol 
provides for detailed and careful monitoring of all patients to assess for toxicity.  Toxicity data from the current dose level will be collected and reviewed to ensure that there were no severe 
toxicities that would preclude further patient enrollment.  Patients will be treated with therapeutic intent and response to the therapy will be closely monitored.  
 RISKS/BENEFITS ANALYSIS  
 Benefits  
The potential benefit to a patient on this study is a reduction in the bulk of their tumor and improvement in cancer lesions, which may or may not have favorable impact on symptoms and/or survival.   
 Risks 
Risks include the possible occurrence of any of a range of side effects which are listed in the 
Consent Document  or this protocol document.  Frequent monitoring for adverse effects will help 
to minimize the risks associated with administration of the study agents. 
 Risks /Benefits Analysis  
The potential benefits from this therapy are disease stabilization or shrinkage and a reduction in symptoms caused by [CONTACT_264349].  Given the efforts

 CONSENT AND ASSENT PROCESS AND DOCUMENTATION  
All patients who are being considered for this trial will undergo informed consent prior to being 
enrolled on the trial. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_264289]. Patients and family members when applicable will be asked to read the consent and will be encouraged to ask questions. It will be stated clearly that participation in the research study is voluntary and that participants can withdraw from the study without losing benefits they would otherwise be entitled to. Patients will be enrolled after the consent document has been signed. Separate consents will be obtained for any surgical procedures performed.  The informed consent process will be documented in the patient’s medical record and on the inf ormed consent document. This process 
will be performed by [CONTACT_264350] [INVESTIGATOR_1461].  
If new safety information results in significant changes in the risk/ benefit assessment, the consent form will be reviewed and updated as necessary. All subjects (including those already being treated) will be informed of the new information, be  given a copy of the revised form, and be asked 
give their consent to continue in the study. 
 Reconsent via phone (at NCI) 
The informed consent document will be sent to the subject.  An explanation of the study will be provided over the telephone after the subject has had the opportunity to read the consent form.  The subject will sign and date the informed consent. A witness to the subject’s signature [CONTACT_131838]. 
The original informed consent document will be sent back to the consenting investigator who will 
sign and date the consent form with the date the consent was obtained via telephone.   A fully executed copy will be returned via mail for the subject’s records.  
The informed consent process will be documented on a progress note by [CONTACT_264351].  
 Informed Consent of non-English speaking subjects (at NCI)  
If there is an unexpected enrollment of a research participant for whom there is no translated extant IRB approved consent document, the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or those authorized to obtain informed consent will use the Short Form Oral Consent Process as described in MAS Policy M77-2, OHSRP SOP 12, and 45 CFR 46.117 (b) (2).  The summary that will be used is the English 
version of the extant IRB approved consent document.  Signed copi[INVESTIGATOR_74841].

 Storage and Stability:   
Store at 25°C (77°F); excursions permitted to 15-30°C (59-86°F). Store in a dry place.  
 Mechanism of Action:  
Sorafenib is a kinase inhibitor that decreases tumor cell proliferation in vitro.  Sorafenib was shown 
to inhibit multiple intracellular (CRAF, BRAF and mutant BRAF) and cell surface kinases (KIT, 
FLT-3, RET, VEGFR -1, VEGFR -2, VEGFR -3, and PDGFR -ß). Several of these kinases are 
thought to be involved in tumor cell signaling, angiogenesis, and apoptosis. Sorafenib inhibited tumor growth and angiogenesis of human hepatocellular carcinoma and renal cell carcinoma, and several other human tumor xenografts in immunocompromised mice. 
 Pharmacology:   
After administration of sorafenib -containing tablets, the drug’s mean elimination half -life is 
between 25 and 48 h.  Sorafenib reaches peak plasma levels f3 h after oral administration. With a high-fat meal, sorafenib bioavailability was reduced 29% compared with fasting bioavailability. 
In vitro binding of sorafenib to human plasma proteins is 99.5%.  Sorafenib is metabolized primarily in the liver; oxidative metabolism is mediated by [CONTACT_097]3A4, and glucuronidation is mediated by [CONTACT_15924]1A9.  Sorafenib accounts for 70% to 85% of the circulating analytes in plasma 
at steady state. Following oral administration of a 100 mg sorafenib dose in a solution formulation, 77% of the dose was excreted in feces, and 19% was excreted in urine as glucuronidated metabolites. Unchanged sorafenib, which accounted for 51% of  the dose, was found in feces but 
not in urine. 
Analyses of demographic data suggest that no dose adjustments are necessary based on patient age 
or gender. No pharmacokinetic data exist for pediatric patients. In patients with mild (Child -Pugh 
A, n = 14 pa tients) or moderate (Child -Pugh B, n = 8) hepatic impairment, drug exposure values 
were within the range observed in patients with no hepatic impairment. Sorafenib’s pharmacokinetics has not been studied in patients with severe (Child- Pugh C) hepatic impai rment.  
In four phase 1 clinical trials, sorafenib was evaluated in patients with normal renal function, mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance >50 -80 mL/min, n = 24), and moderate renal impairment 
(creatinine clearance = 30 -50 mL/min, n = 4).  No relationship was observed between renal 
function and steady -state sorafenib area under the curve at doses of 400 mg twice daily. The drug’s 
pharmacokinetics has not been studied in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 mL/min) or in patients undergoing dialysis. 
Steady -state dosing of ketoconazole (400 mg), a potent inhibitor of cytochrome P450 3A4 
(CYP3A4) did not alter the mean area under the curve of an oral dose of sorafenib.  Administration of sorafenib tablets did not alter the exposure of concomitantly given midazolam 
(CYP3A4 substrate), dextromethorphan (CYP2D6 substrate), or omeprazole (CYP2C19 substrate). The possible effect of sorafenib on the CYP2C9 substrate warfarin was assessed indirectly by [CONTACT_145852] -INR. Mean changes from baseline in PT -INR were not higher in 
patients administered sorafenib tablets compared with patients given a placebo. Although not studied clinically, inducers of CYP3A4 activity are expected to increase metabolism of sorafenib and thus decrease sorafenib concentrations. 
Sorafenib tablets have been given with the antineoplastic agent’s gemcitabine, oxaliplatin, 
doxorubicin, and irinotecan.  Concomitant treatment with sorafenib resulted in a 21% increase in the area under the curve of doxorubicin. When given with irinotecan, whose active metabolite 
Abbreviated Title: Ph 1/2 Everolimus & Sorafenib  
Version Date:  06/15/[ADDRESS_321423], sorafenib produced a 67% to 120% 
increase in the area under the curve of SN -38 and a 26% to 42% increase in the area under the 
curve of irinotecan. Because sorafenib inhibits CYP2B6 and CYP2C8 in vitro, systemic 
exposure to substrates of CYP2B6 and CYP2C8 might be expected to increase when co-administered with sorafenib. Similarly, although not studied clinically, sorafenib inhibits glucuronidation by [CONTACT_192643]1A1 and UGT1A9 pathways, and systemic exposure to substrates of UGT1A1 and UGT1A9 may increase when co-administered with sorafenib. CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 activities were not altered after treatment of cultured human hepatocytes with sorafenib, indicating that sorafenib is unlikely to be an inducer of CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 in vivo. 
 Pre-clinical Toxicology:  
Repeat -dose animal toxicology was generally predictive of the toxicities observed in humans as 
indicated by [CONTACT_264352]. In the repeat -dose toxicology studies, findings included 
cirrhotic changes, glomerulopathy and renal tubular dilation, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, adrenal necrosis and hemorrhage, hypothyroidism, pancreatitis, and changes in serum a -amylase. 
Osteodystrophy of the jaw was noted in rats.  Young animals showed incomplete epi[INVESTIGATOR_146871], thickening of growth plates, and dentin alteration. Potential cardiotoxicity was evidenced by [CONTACT_264353]/congestion/he morrhage in the heart and increased creatine kinase in the chronic dog 
toxicity study. Changes in coagulation values were inconclusive. Sorafenib can cross the blood-brain barrier. Based on a safety pharmacology study, sorafenib may cause sensory neuropath y. 
Sorafenib is teratogenic. Embryo- fetal toxicities, observed in rats and rabbits, occurred at 
subtherapeutic exposures and included increased post -implantation loss, fetal malformations, and 
necrotic placentas. Although fertility and early developmental studies were not conducted, adverse findings in the reproductive organs in the repeat dose toxicity studies suggest that sorafenib has the potential to impair reproductive function and fertility in males and females. Pharmacokinetic studies in rats with ra diolabeled sorafenib indicated that sorafenib is excreted into the milk.

[IP_ADDRESS] Laboratory Abnormalities  
The following laboratory abnormalities were observed in the phase III advanced RCC (TARGETS) trial:  
Elevated lipase and amylase:  Elevated lipase and amylase levels were very commonly reported. CTC AE Grade 3 or 4 lipase elevations occurred in 12% of patients in the sorafenib group compared 
to 7% of patients in the placebo group. CTC AE Grade 3 or 4 amylase elevations were reported in 
1% of patients in the sorafenib group compared to 3% of patients in the placebo group. Clinical pancreatitis was reported in 2 of 451 sorafenib treated patients ( CTC AE Grade 4) and 1 of 451 
patients ( CTC AE Grade 2) in the placebo group. 
Hypophosphatemia:  Hypophosphataemia was a common laboratory finding, observed in 45% of sorafenib treated patients compared to 12% of placebo patients. CTC AE Grade 3 
hypophosphataemia (1–2 mg/dl) occurred in 13% on sorafenib treated patients and 3% of patients in the placebo group. There were no cases of CTCAE  Grade 4 hypophosphataemia (< 1 mg/dl) 
reported in either sorafenib or placebo patients. The etiology of hypophosphataemia associated with sorafenib is not known. 
Lymphopenia:  CTC AE Grade 3 or 4 were reported for lymphopenia in 13% of sorafenib treat ed 
patients and 7% of placebo patients, for neutropenia in 5% of sorafenib treated patients and 2% of 
placebo patients, for anemia in 2% of sorafenib treated patients and 4% of placebo patients and for thrombocytopenia in 1% of sorafenib treated patients and 0% of placebo. 
Anemia:  Observed in 44% of sorafenib- treated patients and 49% of placebo patients.  CTCAE 
Grade 3 or 4 anemia was reported in 2% of sorafenib- treated patients and 4% of placebo patients.  
Thrombocytopenia:  Observed in 12% of sorafenib- treated patients and 5% of placebo patients.  
CTCAE Grade  3 or 4 thrombocytopenia was reported in 1% of sorafenib- treated patients and 0% 
of placebo patients.  
Special Warnings and Precautions for Use Sorafenib (Nexavar®) is approved for treatment of patients  with advanced renal cancer and 
unresectable hepatocellular cancer.  Because this is a novel agent, current knowledge of the adverse 
events associated with this compound is limited. As with any new chemical entity, there is always potential for unexpected adverse events.  
Pregnancy: Women should avoid becoming pregnant while on therapy. 
Women of childbearing potential must be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus, which 
includes severe malformation (teratogenicity), failure to thrive and fetal death (embryotoxicity).  
Sorafenib should not be used during pregnancy. Prescribers may only consider it to be used, if the potential benefits justify the potential risks to the fetus.  
Based on the proposed mechanism of multikinase inhibition and multiple advers e effects seen in 
animals at exposure levels significantly below the clinical dose, sorafenib should be assumed to cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman.  
Abbreviated Title: Ph 1/2 Everolimus & Sorafenib  
Version Date:  06/15/18  Page 65 of 99 
 Breastfeeding should be discontinued during sorafenib therapy.  
Dermatological Toxicit ies: Hand -foot skin reaction (palmar -plantar erythrodysaesthesia) and 
rash represent the most common adverse drug reactions with sorafenib. Rash and hand- foot skin 
reaction are usually CTC AE Grade [ADDRESS_321424] six weeks of 
treatment with sorafenib. Management of dermatologic toxicities may include topi[INVESTIGATOR_264290], temporary treatment interruption and/or dose modification of sorafenib, or in severe or persistent cases, permanent discontinuation of sor afenib.  Patients who take sorafenib 
should be suggested to avoid long exposure to hot water such as washing dishes, long showers, or tub bath, and to avoid the activities to cause excessive pressure and friction on the soles of the feet or palms of hands such as jogging, aerobics, power walking, jumpi[INVESTIGATOR_007], and/or using garden and household tools.  Hand- foot syndrome may be treated with topi[INVESTIGATOR_39669] (such as 
Aquaphor ), topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855]/systemic steroids, and/or antihistamine agents. Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine; 500-
1250 mg orally each day) may also be used.  
Hypertension: An increased incidence of hypertension was observed in sorafenib- treated patients. 
Hypertension was usually mild to moderate, occurred early in the course of treatment, and was 
amenable to management  with standard antihypertensive therapy. Blood pressure should be 
monitored regularly and treated, if required, in accordance with standard medical practice. In cases of severe or persistent hypertension, or hypertensive crisis despi[INVESTIGATOR_264291], permanent discontinuation of sorafenib should be considered. 
Hemorrhage: An increase in the risk of bleeding may occur following sorafenib administration. 
The incidence of severe bleeding events is uncommon. If any bleeding event necessitates medical 
intervention, it is recommended that permanent discontinuation of sorafenib should be considered. 
Wound healing complications: No formal studies of the effect of sorafenib on wound healing 
have been conducted. In patients undergoing major surgical procedures, temporary interruption of 
sorafenib therapy is recommended for precautionary reasons. There is limited clinical experience regarding the timing of reinitiation of therapy following major surgical intervention. Therefore, the decision to resume sorafenib therapy following a major surgical intervention should be based on clinical judgment of adequate wound healing. 
Cardiac Ischemia and/or Infarction: In the Phase 3 Advanced RCC study (TARGETS), the 
incidence of treatment -emergent cardiac ischemia/infarction events was higher in the sorafenib 
group (2.9%) compared with the placebo group (0.4%). Patients with unstable coronary artery 
disease or recent myocardial infarction were excluded from this study. Temporary or permanent discontinuation of sorafenib should be considered in patients who develop cardiac ischemia and/or infarction.  
Gastrointestinal perforation : Gastrointestinal perforation is an uncommon event and has been 
reported in less than 1% of patients taking sorafenib. In some cases this was not associated with 
apparent intra -abdominal tumor. Sorafenib therapy should be discontinued in patients with GI 
perforation.    Effects on ability to drive and use machines: No studies on the effects of sorafenib on the ability 
to drive or use machines have been performed. There is no evidence that sorafenib affects the 
ability to drive or operate machinery. 
Patients with Hepatic Impairment:   In vitro  and in vivo  data indicate that sorafenib is primarily 
metabolized by [CONTACT_4852].  Systemic exposure and safety data were comparable in patients with 
Abbreviated Title: Ph 1/2 Everolimus & Sorafenib  
Version Date:  06/15/18  Page 66 of 99 
 Child -Pugh A and B hepatic impairment.  Sorafenib has not been studied in patients with Child-
Pugh C hepatic impairment.  No dose adjustment is necessary when administering sorafenib to 
patients with Child -Pugh A and B hepatic impairment.  
Patients with Renal Impairment:  Sorafenib has not been studied in patients with severe renal 
impairment (CrCl <30  mL/min) or in patien ts undergoing dialysis. 
Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: Carcinogenicity studies have not been 
performed with sorafenib.  Sorafenib was clastogenic when tested in an in vitro  mammalian cell 
assay (Chinese Hamster Ovary) in the presence  of metabolic activation.  Sorafenib was not 
mutagenic in the in vitro  Ames bacterial cell assay or clastogenic in an in vivo  mouse micronucleus 
assay.  One intermediate in the manufacturing process, which is also present in the final drug substance (<0.15%), was positive for mutagenesis in an in vitro  bacterial cell assay (Ames test) 
when tested independently.  No specific studies with sorafenib have been conducted in animals to evaluate the effect on fertility.  However, results from the repeat -dose toxicity studies suggest there 
is a potential for sorafenib to impair reproductive performance and fertility.  Multiple adverse effects were observed in male and female reproductive organs, with the rat being more susceptible than mice or dogs.  Typi[INVESTIGATOR_264292], 
degeneration of epi[INVESTIGATOR_4046], prostate, and seminal vesicles, central necrosis of the corpora lutea and arrested follicular development.  Sorafenib- related effects on the reproductive organs of rats 
were manifested at daily oral doses ≥30 mg/m
2 (approximately 0.5 times the AUC in cancer 
patients at the recommended human dose).  Dogs showed tubular degeneration in the testes at 600 mg/m
2/day (approximately 0.3 times the AUC at the recommended human dose) and oligospermia 
at 1200 mg/m2/day of sorafenib. Adequate contraception should be used during therapy and for at 
least 2 weeks after completing therapy.  
Pediatric Use:  The safety and effectiveness of sorafenib in pediatric patients have not been 
studied.  Repeat dosing of sorafenib to young and growing dogs resulted in irregular thickening of the femoral growth plate at daily sorafenib doses ≥600 mg/m
2 (approximately 0.3 times the AUC 
at the recommended human dose), hypocellularity of the bone marrow adjoining the growth plate 
at 200 mg/m2/day (approximately 0.1 times the AUC at the recommended human dose), and 
alterations of the dentin composition at 600 mg/m2/day.  Similar effects were not observed in adult 
dogs when dosed for 4 weeks or less. 
Geriatric Use:  In total, 32% of RCC patients treated with sorafenib were age 65 years or older, 
and 4% were 75 and older. No differences in safety or efficacy were observed between older and 
younger patients, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients , but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot 
be ruled out. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Interaction with Other Medications  
Drug -Drug Interactions: Caution is recommended when administering sorafe nib together with 
compounds that are metabolized/ eliminated predominantly by [CONTACT_192643]1A1 pathway (e.g. 
irinotecan) .
. 
• CYP3A4 inducers: There is no clinical information on the effect of CYP3A4 inducers on 
the pharmacokinetics of sorafenib. Inducers of CYP3A4 activity (e.g. rifampi[INVESTIGATOR_2513], 
Hypericum perforatum also known as St. John’s wort, phenytoin, carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], 
Abbreviated Title: Ph 1/2 Everolimus & Sorafenib  
Version Date:  06/15/18  Page 67 of 99 
 phenobarbital, and dexamethasone) may increase metabolism of sorafenib and thus 
decrease sorafenib plasma concentrations.  
• CYP3A4 inhibitors: Ketoconaz ole, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, administered once 
daily for 7 days to healthy male volunteers did not alter the mean AUC of a single 50 mg dose of sorafenib. Therefore, clinical pharmacokinetic interactions of sorafenib with CYP3A4 inhibitors are unlike ly. 
• CYP2C9 substrates: The possible effect of sorafenib on the metabolism of the CYP2C9 
substrate warfarin was assessed indirectly by [CONTACT_264355]. The mean changes from baseline in PT -INR were not higher in sorafenib patients compared to placebo patients, 
suggesting that sorafenib did not inhibit warfarin metabolism in vivo . However, patients 
taking warfarin should have their INR checked regularly. 
• CYP isoform -selective substrates: Concomitant administration of midazolam, 
dextromethorphan and omeprazole, which are substrates of cytochromes CYP3A4, CYP2D6 and CYP2C19, respectively, following 4 weeks of sorafenib administration did not significantly alter the exposure of these agents. This indicates that sorafenib is neither an inhibitor nor a clinically meaningful inducer of these cytochrome P450 isoenzymes. 
• Combination with other anti -neoplastic agents: In clinical studies, sorafenib has been 
administered together with a variety of other antineoplastic agents at their commonly used dosing regimens, including gemcitabine, oxaliplatin, doxorubicin, and irinotecan. Sorafenib had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of gemcitabine or oxaliplatin. Concomitant treatment with sorafenib resulted in a 21% increase in the AUC of doxorubicin. When administered with irinotecan, whose active metabolite SN -[ADDRESS_321425], there was a 67 -120% increase in the AUC of SN -
38 and a 26- 42% increase in the AUC of irinotecan. The clinical significance of these 
findings is unknown. However, caution is  recommended when administering  sorafenib 
with doxorubicin and with compounds that are metabolized/eliminated predominantly by [CONTACT_192643]1A1 pathway (e.g. irinotecan).  
• Warfarin: Infrequent bleeding events or elevations in the International Normalized Ratio 
(INR) have been reported in some patients taking warfarin while on sorafenib therapy. 
Patients taking warfarin concomitantly should be monitored regularly for changes in prothrombin time, INR and for clinical bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Pregnancy and Lactation  
Pregn ancy: Women should avoid becoming pregnant while on therapy. Women of childbearing 
potential must be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus, which includes severe malformation (teratogenicity), failure to thrive and fetal death (embryotoxicity). Sorafenib should not be used during pregnancy. Prescribers may only consider it to be used, if the potential benefits justify the potential risks to the fetus.  
• There are no adequate and well -controlled studies in pregnant women using sorafenib. 
Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity including malformations. In rats, sorafenib and its metabolites were demonstrated to cross the placenta and sorafenib is anticipated to inhibit angiogenesis in the fetus.

 • Women should avoid becoming pregnant while on therapy. Women of childbearing 
potential must be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus, which includes severe malformation (teratogenicity), failure to thrive and fetal death (embryotoxicity).  
• Sorafenib should not be used during pregnancy. Prescribers may only consider it to be used, if the potential benefits justify the potential risks to the fetus.  
• In animals, sorafenib has been shown to be teratogenic and embryotoxic. Adequate contraception should be used during therapy and for at least 2 weeks after completion of therapy.  
Breastfeeding should be discontinued during sorafenib therapy. 
• It is not known whether sorafenib is excreted in human milk. In animals, sorafenib and/or its metabolites were excreted in milk. Because many drugs are excreted in hu man milk and 
because the effects of sorafenib on infants have not been studied, woman should discontinue breastfeeding during sorafenib treatment. 
Effects on fertility: Results from animal studies indicate that sorafenib can impair male and 
female fertilit y. 
 Clinical Pharmacokinetic Properties: 
After administration of sorafenib tablets, the mean relative bioavailability is 38 -49% when 
compared to an oral solution. The mean elimination half -life of sorafenib is approximately 25-48 
hours. Multiple dosing of sorafenib for 7 days resulted in a 2.5- to 7- fold accumulation compared 
to single dose administration.   
Steady -state plasma sorafenib concentrations are achieved within 7 days, with a peak -to-trough 
ratio of mean concentrations of less than 2. [IP_ADDRESS] Absorption and Distribution 
Following oral administration, sorafenib reaches peak plasma levels in approximately 3 hours. 
When given with a moderate -fat meal (30% fat; 700 calories), bioavailability was similar to that 
in the fasted state. With a high -fat meal (50% f at; 900 calories), sorafenib bioavailability was 
reduced by 29% compared to administration in the fasted state. It is recommended that sorafenib be administered without food.  Mean Cmax and AUC increased less than proportionally beyond          doses of 400 mg administered orally twice daily.   In vitro binding of sorafenib to human plasma 
proteins is 99.5%. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Metabolism and Elimination  
Sorafenib is metabolized primarily in the liver, undergoing oxidative metabolism, mediated by 
[CONTACT_097]3A4, as well as glucuronidation mediated by [CONTACT_15924]1A9.  Sorafenib accounts for approximately 70-85% of the circulating analytes in plasma at steady -state. Eight metabolites of sorafenib have 
been identified, of which five have been detected in plasma. The main circulating metabolite of sorafenib in plasma, the pyridine N -oxide, shows in vitro potency similar to that of sorafenib. This 
metabolite comprises approximately 9 -16% of circulating analytes at steady -state.  Following oral 
administration of a 100 mg dose of a solution formulation of sorafenib, 96% of the dose was 
recovered within 14 days, with 77% of the dose excreted in feces, and 19% of the dose excreted in urine as glucuronidated metabolites. Unchanged sorafenib, accounting for 51% of the dose, was found in feces but not in uri ne.

 [IP_ADDRESS] Special Populations 
Age: Analyses of demographic data suggest that no dose adjustments are necessary for age.  
Gender: Analyses of demographic data suggest that no dose adjustments are necessary for gender. 
Race: A study of the pharmacokinetics of sorafenib indicated that the mean AUC of sorafenib in 
Asians (N=78) was 30% lower than in Caucasians (N=40). 
Pediatric: There are no pharmacokinetic data in pediatric patients.  
Hepatic Impairment: Sorafenib is cleared primarily by [CONTACT_4852].  Comparison of data  across 
studies suggests that in HCC patients with mild (Child -Pugh A) or moderate (Child- Pugh B) 
hepatic impairment, 400 mg doses of sorafenib appear to be associated with AUC values that were 
23 to 65% lower than those of other subjects without hepatic impairment. The AUC of sorafenib is similar between HCC patients with mild (Child -Pugh A) and moderate (Child- Pugh B) hepatic 
impairment. The pharmacokinetics of sorafenib have not been studied in patients with severe (Child -Pugh C) hepatic impairment. 
Rena l Impairment: In a study of drug disposition after a single oral dose of radiolabeled sorafenib 
to healthy subjects, 19% of the administered dose of sorafenib was excreted in urine.  In a clinical pharmacology study, the pharmacokinetics of sorafenib were evaluated following administration 
of a single 400 mg dose to subjects with normal renal function, and in subjects with mild (CrCl > 50-80 ml/min), moderate (CrCl 30 -50 ml/min), or severe (CrCl <30 ml/min) renal impairment, not 
undergoing dialysis. There was no relationship observed between sorafenib exposure and renal function. No dosage adjustment is necessary based on mild, moderate or severe renal impairment not undergoing dialysis.  Monitoring of fluid balance and electrolytes in patients at risk of re nal 
dysfunction is advised.

 Mechanism of Action:  
Everolimus is an inhibitor of mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin), a serine -threonine kinase, 
downstream of the PI3K/AKT pathway. The mTOR pathway is dysregulated in several human cancers. Ever olimus binds to an intracellular protein, FKBP -12, resulting in an inhibitory complex 
formation and inhibition of mTOR kinase activity. Everolimus reduced the activity of S6 ribosomal protein kinase (S6K1) and eukaryotic elongation factor 4E -binding protein (4E -BP), 
downstream effectors of mTOR, involved in protein synthesis. In addition, everolimus inhibited the expression of hypoxia -inducible factor (e.g., HIF -1) and reduced the expression of vascular 
endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Inhibition of mTOR by [CONTACT_264357], angiogenesis, and glucose uptake in in vitro and/or in vivo studies.

 Pharmacology:  
[IP_ADDRESS] Drug Interactions  
Everolimus is a substrate of CYP3A4, and also a substrate and moderate inhibitor of the multidrug 
efflux pump PgP. In vitro, everolimus is a competitive inhibitor of CYP3A4 and a mixed inhibitor of CYP2D6.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].1 Agents that may Increase Everolimus Blood Concentrations 
CYP3A4 Inhibitors and PgP Inhibitors: In healthy subjects, compared to everolimus treatment 
alone there were significant increases in everolimus exposure when everolimus was co-
administered  with: 
• ketoconazole (a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor and a PgP inhibitor) - Cmax and AUC increased 
by 3.9- and 15.0-fold, respectively. 
• erythromycin (a mo derate CYP3A4 inhibitor and a PgP inhibitor) - Cmax and AUC 
increased by 2.0 - and 4.4-fold, respectively. 
• verapamil (a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor and a PgP inhibitor) - Cmax and AUC increased 
by 2.3-and 3.5- fold, respectively.  
Concomitant strong or moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 and PgP inhibitors should not be used. 
[IP_ADDRESS].2 Agents that may Decrease Everolimus Blood Concentrations  
CYP3A4 Inducers: In healthy subjects, co -administration of everolimus with rifampin, a strong 
inducer of CYP3A4, decreased everolimus AUC  and Cmax by 64% and 58% respectively, 
compared to everolimus treatment alone. Consider a dose increase of everolimus when co -
administered with strong inducers of CYP3A4 or PgP if alternative treatment cannot be 
administered.  
Agents whose Plasma Concentrat ions may be Altered by [CONTACT_264358] -CoA reductase inhibitors atorvastatin (a CYP3A4 substrate) and pravastatin (a non-
CYP3A4 substrate) and population pharmacokinetic analyses also detected no influence of 
simvastatin (a CYP3A4 substrate) on the clearance of everolimus. 
Patients will be instructed not to take any additional medications (including over -the-counter 
products) during the course of the study without prior consultation with the investigator. At each 
visit, the investigator will ask the patient about any new medications he/she is or has taken after 
the start of the study drug. 
All Concomitant medications/Significan t non-drug therapi[INVESTIGATOR_32546] ≤ 30 days prior to start and 
after start of study drug, including physical therapy and blood transfusions, should be recorded. 
• Growth factors (e.g.  G-CSF, GM -CSF, erythropoietin, platelets growth factors etc.) are not 
to be administered prophylactically but may be prescribed by [CONTACT_264359], if this is thought to be appropriate. 
• Concurrent administration of everolimus and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir) and inducers (such as rifampin, rifabutin) should be 
Abbreviated Title: Ph 1/2 Everolimus & Sorafenib  
Version Date:  06/15/18  Page 72 of 99 
 avoided. Provided there is no alternative treatment available, patients should be closely 
monitored for potential toxicities.  
• Concurrent administration of everolimus and moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as erythromycin, fluconazole, calcium channel blockers, benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651]) and moderate CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], phenobarbital) should also be avoided if possible, or used subject to caution (e.g. increased frequency of safety monitoring, temporary interruption of everolimus). 
• Competitive inhibition could occur when everolimus is combined with drugs which are also CYP3A4 substrates. Therefore caution should be exercised in such cases. 
• Co-administration with substrates, inducers, or inhibi tors of P -glycoprotein should be 
avoided, if possible, or used subject to caution (e.g. increased frequency of safety monitoring, temporary interruption of everolimus).  
• Grapefruit and grapefruit juice affect cytochrome P450 and P -glycoprotein activity and 
should therefore be avoided.  
• In addition, patients should avoid Seville oranges and star fruit, as well as the juice of these fruits, which are potent CYP3A4-inhibitors.  
• No chronic treatment with immunosuppressive agents. Topi[INVESTIGATOR_129534].  
• Everolimus may affect the response to vaccinations making the response to the vaccination less effective. Live vaccines should be avoided while a patient is treated with everolimus. 
Oral anticoagulants such as warfarin are CYP2C9 substrates and, as such, no interaction with everolimus is expected. However, drug -drug interaction studies between macrolide antibiotics and 
warfarin have produced mixed outcomes and the disparity in these findings has led to the conclusion that multiple factors may alter the clearance of warfarin. The co-administration  of 
everolimus and oral anticoagulants is possible but should be subject to verification of coagulation (INR) once steady state is reached (after one week’s treatment).  
Examples are provided in Table [ADDRESS_321427] of cytochrome P450 isoenzymes and 
CYP3A4 inhibitors, inducers, and substrates can be found at http://medicine.iupui.edu/flockhart.  This website is continually revised and should be checked frequently for updates. 
 Pre-clinical Toxicology:  
In safety pharmacology studies, Everolimus was devoid of relevant effects on vital functions 
including the cardiovascular, respi[INVESTIGATOR_129521]. Everolimus had no influence on QT 
interval prolongation. Furthermore, everolimus showed no antigenic potential. Although everolimus passes the blood- brain barrier, there was no indication of relevant changes in the 
behavior of rodents, even after single oral doses up to 2000mg/kg or after repeated administration at up to 40 mg/kg/day. Based on these findings, the potential of everolimus to affect vital functions in patients is considered to be low.  Everolimus is considered to have no genotoxicity or carcinogenicity potential. All significant adverse events observed in preclinical toxicology studies with everolimus in mice, rats, monkeys and minipi[INVESTIGATOR_264293] a 2 - or 4-week recovery period with the exception of the changes in male reproductive organs, 
Abbreviated Title: Ph 1/2 Everolimus & Sorafenib  
Version Date:  06/15/[ADDRESS_321428] notably testes. Ocular effects (lenticular disorders) observed in rats were not observed in any 
other species and are considered to be a species -specific disorder.  
 Human Toxicity:  
Hypersensitivity to the active substance, to other rapamycin derivatives, or to any of the excipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. Hypersensitivity reactions manifested by [CONTACT_129572], but not limited to, anaphylaxis, 
dyspnea, flushing, chest pain, or angioedema (e.g., swelling of the airways or tongue, with or without respi[INVESTIGATOR_88739]) have been observed with everolimus and other rapamycin derivatives.  
WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS  
[IP_ADDRESS] Non-infectious Pneumonitis  
Non-infectious pneumonitis is a class effect of rapamycin derivatives, including everolimus. In the 
randomized study, non -infectious pneumonitis was reported in 14% of patients treated with 
everolimus. The incidence of CTC AE grade 3 and 4 non-infectious pneumonitis was 4% and 0%, 
respectively . Fatal outcomes have been observed.  
Consider a diagnosis of non- infectious pneumonitis in patients presenting with non- specific 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_036], pleural effusion, cough, or dyspnea, and in whom infectious, neoplastic, and other causes have been excluded by [CONTACT_129575]. Advise patients to report promptly any new or worsening respi[INVESTIGATOR_1856]. 
Patients who develop radiological changes suggestive of non- infectious pneumonitis and have few 
or no symptoms may continue everolimus therapy without dose alteration. If symptoms are 
moderate, consider interrupting therapy until symptoms improve. The use of corticosteroids may be indicated. Everolimus may be reintroduced at 5 mg daily. 
For cases where symptoms of non- infectious pneumonitis are severe, discontinue everolimus 
therapy and the use of corticosteroids may be indicated until clinical symptoms resolve. Therapy 
with everolimus may be re -initiated at a redu ced dose of 5 mg daily depending on the individual 
clinical circumstances.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Infections  
Everolimus has immunosuppressive properties and may predispose patients to infections, 
especially infections with opportunistic pathogens . Localized and systemic infectio ns, including 
pneumonia, other bacterial infections and invasive fungal infections, such as aspergillosis or candidiasis, have occurred in patients taking everolimus. Some of these infections have been severe (e.g., leading to respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399]) or fatal . Physicians and patients should be aware of the 
increased risk of infection with everolimus, be vigilant for signs and symptoms of infection and institute appropriate treatment promptly. Complete treatment of pre -existing invasive fungal 
infections prior to starting treatment with everolimus. If a diagnosis of invasive systemic fungal 
infection is made, discontinue everolimus and treat with appropriate antifungal therapy. 
Reactivation of Hepatitis B (HBV) has been observed in patients with cancer receiving  
chemotherapy. Sporadic cases of Hepatitis B reactivation have also been seen in this setting with 
everolimus. Use of antivirals during anti -cancer therapy has been shown to reduce the risk of 
Hepatitis B virus reactivation and associated morbidity and mor tality. A detailed assessment of 
Hepatitis B/C medical history and risk factors must be done for all patients at screening, with testing performed prior to the first dose of everolimus.

 [IP_ADDRESS] Oral Ulceration  
Mouth ulcers, stomatitis, and oral mucositis have occurred in patients treated with everolimus. In 
the randomized study, approximately 44% of everolimus treated patients developed mouth ulcers, stomatitis, or oral mucositis, which were mostly CTC AE grade 1 and 2 . In such cases, topi[INVESTIGATOR_264294], but alcohol - or peroxide -containing mouthwashes should be avoided 
as they may exacerbate the condition. Antifungal agents should not be used unless fungal infection has been diagnosed. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Renal Function 
Elevations of serum creatinine, usually mild, have been reported in clinical trials. Monitoring of 
renal function, including measurement of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) or serum creatinine, is recommended prior to the start of everolimus therapy and periodically thereafter.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Blood Glucose and Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_264295], hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], and hypertriglyceridemia have been reported in clinical trials. 
Monitoring of fasting serum glucose and lipid profile is recommended prior to the start of everolimus therapy and periodically thereafter. When possible, optimal glucose and lipid control should be achieved before starting a patient on everolimus. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Hematological Parameters  
Decreased hemoglobin, lymphocytes, neutrophils, and platelets have been reported in clinical 
trials . Monitoring of complete blood count is recommended prior to the start of everolimus therapy 
and periodically thereafter. 
[IP_ADDRESS] CYP3A4 Interactions  
Due to significant increases in exposure of everolimus, co- administration with strong or moderate 
inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, atazanavir, nefazodone, 
saquinavir, telithromycin, ritonavir, amprenavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, delavirdine, fosamprenavir, 
voriconazole, aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_053], erythromycin, fluconazole, grapefruit juice, verapamil or diltazem) or P -
glycoprotein (PgP) should be avoided. 
Everolimus is a substrate of CYP3A4, and also a substrate and moderate inhibitor of the multidrug 
efflux pump PgP. In vitro, everolimus is a competitive inhibitor of CYP3A4 and a mixed inhibitor of CYP2D6. 
[IP_ADDRESS].1 Agents that may Increase Everolimus Blood Concentrations CYP3A4 Inhibitors 
and PgP Inhibitors:  
In healthy subjects, compared to everolimus treatment alone there were significant increases in everolimus exposure when everolimus was coadministered with: 
• ketoconazole (a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor and a PgP inhibitor) - Cmax and AUC increased 
by 3.9- and 15.0-fold, respectively. 
• erythromycin (a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor and a PgP inhibitor) - Cmax and AUC 
increased by 2.0 - and 4.4-fold, respectively. 
• verapamil (a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor and a PgP inhibi tor) - Cmax and AUC increased 
by 2.3-and 3.5- fold, respectively.  
Abbreviated Title: Ph 1/2 Everolimus & Sorafenib  
Version Date:  06/15/18  Page 75 of 99 
 Concomitant strong or moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 and PgP inhibitors should not be 
used. 
[IP_ADDRESS].2 Agents that may Decrease Everolimus Blood Concentrations CYP3A4 Inducers:  
In healthy subjects, co-administration of everolimus with rifampin, a strong inducer of CYP3A4, 
decreased everolimus AUC and Cmax by 64% and 58% respectively, compared to everolimus treatment alone. Consider a dose increase of everolimus when co- administered with strong 
inducers of CYP3A4 or PgP if alternative treatment cannot be administered. 
[IP_ADDRESS].3 Agents whose Plasma Concentrations may be Altered by [CONTACT_264360] -CoA reductase inhibitors atorvastatin (a CYP3A4 
substrate) and pravastatin (a non -CYP3A4 substrate) and population pharmacokinetic analyses 
also detected no influence of simvastatin (a CYP3A4 substrate) on the clearance of everolimus.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Advers e Reactions  
Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, the adverse reaction rates observed cannot be directly compared to rates in other trials and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.  
The data described below reflect exposure to everolimus (n=274) and placebo (n=137) in a randomized, controlled trial in patients with metastatic  renal cell carcinoma who received prior 
treatment with sunitinib and/or sorafenib. The median age of patients was 61 years (range 27-85), 88% were Caucasian, and 78% were male. The median duration of blinded study treatment was 141 days (range 19 -451) for patients receiving everolimus and 60 days (range 21- 295) for those 
receiving placebo.  
The most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥30%) were stomatitis, infections, asthenia, 
fatigue, cough, and diarrhea. The most common grade 3/4 adverse reactions (incidence ≥3%) were infections, dyspnea, fatigue, stomatitis, dehydration, pneumonitis, abdominal pain, and asthenia. The most common la boratory abnormalities (incidence ≥50%) were anemia, 
hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, hyperglycemia, lymphopenia, and increased creatinine. The most common grade 3/4 laboratory abnormalities (incidenc e ≥3%) were 
lymphopenia, hyperglycemia, anemia, hypophosphatemia, and hypercholesterolemia. Deaths due to acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399] (0.7%), infection (0.7%) and acute renal failure (0.4%) were observed on the everolimus arm but none on the placebo arm. The  rates of treatment -emergent adverse 
events ( irrespective of causality) resulting in permanent discontinuation were 14% and 3% for the 
everolimus and placebo treatment groups, respectively. The most common adverse reactions (irrespective of causality) leading to treatment discontinuation were pneumonitis and dyspnea. 
Infections, stomatitis, and pneumonitis were the most common reasons for treatment delay or dose 
reduction. The most common medical interventions required during everolimus treatment were for infections, anemia, and stomatitis.  
Likely (oc curring in more than 20% of patients)  
Adverse events most frequently observed with everolimus are rash, stomatitis/oral mucositis, fatigue, anorexia, nausea, diarrhea, peripheral edema, asthenia, cough, dyspnea, ocular toxicity and infections.  Infections include nasopharyngitis (6%), pneumonia (6%), urinary tract infection (5%), bronchitis (4%), sinusitis (3%), aspergillosis (<1%), candidiasis (<1%), and sepsis (<1%).   
Abbreviated Title: Ph 1/2 Everolimus & Sorafenib  
Version Date:  06/15/18  Page 76 of 99 
 Laboratory abnormalities include anemia, n eutropenia, thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia, 
hypercholesterolemia, and/or hypertriglyceridemia, hyperglycemia, hypophosphatemia, aspartate 
and alanine transaminase elevation. The majority of these AEs have been of mild to moderate 
severity (CTC AE grade 1 -2). 
Common (occurring in 3 – 20% of Patients) 
Adverse events occurring in 3- 20% of patients include vomiting, pyrexia, mucosal inflammation, 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940], pneumonitis (includes pneumonitis, interstitial lung disease, lung infiltration,, pulmonary alveolar hemorrhage, pulmonary toxicity, and alveolitis), pruritus, dry skin, headache, dysgeusia, pain in extremity, abdominal pain, dry mouth, hemorrhoids, dysphagi a, chest pain, 
chills, pleural effusion, pharyngolaryngeal pain, rhinorrhea, hand -foot syndrome, nail disorder, 
erythema, onychoclasis, skin lesion, a cneiform dermatitis, insomnia, dizziness, paresthesia, eyelid 
edema, hypertension, renal failure, tachycardia, jaw pain, and  hemorrhage. 
Laboratory abnormalities include increased bilirubin (<1% grade 3 or 4). 
Rare but Serious (occurring in fewer than 3% of patients) 
Acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_264296].  
[IP_ADDRESS] Pregnancy and Breast Feeding  
There are no adequate and well -controlled studies of everolimus in pregnant women. However, 
based on mechanism of acti on, everolimus may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant 
woman. Everolimus caused embryo- fetal toxicities in animals at maternal exposures that were 
lower than human exposures at the recommended dose of [ADDRESS_321429] -implantation loss, decreased numbers of live fetuses, malformation (e.g., 
sternal cleft) and retarded skeletal development. These effects occurred in the absence of maternal toxicities. Embryo -fetal toxicities occurred at approximately 4% the exposure ( AUC0 -24h) in 
patients receiving the reco mmended dose of [ADDRESS_321430] -natal development study in rats, animals were dosed from implantation through 
lactat ion. At approximately 10% of the recommended human dose based on body surface area, 
there were no adverse effects on delivery and lactation and there were no signs of maternal toxicity. 
However, there was reduced body weight (up to 9% reduction from the  control) and slight 
reduction in survival in offspring (~5% died or missing). There were no drug -related effects on the 
developmenta l parameters (morphological development, motor activity, learning, or fertility 
assessment) in the offspring. 
Abbreviated Title: Ph 1/2 Everolimus & Sorafenib  
Version Date:  06/15/18  Page 77 of 99 
 Doses that resulted in embryo -fetal toxicities in rats and rabbits were ≥0.1 mg/kg (0.6 mg/m2) and 
0.8 mg/kg (9.6 mg/m2), respectively. The dose in the pre - and post -natal development study in rats 
that caused reduction in body weights and survival of offspring was 0.1 mg/kg (0.6 mg/m2). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Nursing Mothers 
It is not known whether everolimus is excreted in human milk. Everolimus and/or its metabolites 
passed into the milk of lactating rats at a concentration 3.[ADDRESS_321431] dose.  
 Clinical Pharmacokinetic Properties: 
Absorption 
In patients with advanced solid tumors, peak everolimus concentrations are reached [ADDRESS_321432]: 
Based on data in healthy  subjects taking 10 mg everolimus tablets, a high -fat meal reduced Cmax 
and AUC by 54% and 22%, respectively.   
Distribution  
The blood- to-plasma ratio of everolimus, which is concentration-dependent over the range of 5 to 
5000 ng/mL, is 17% to 73%. The amount of everolimus confined to the plasma is approximately 20% at blood concentrations observed in cancer patients given everolimus 10 mg/day. Plasma protein binding is approximately 74% both in healthy subjects and in patients with moderate hepatic impairment.   
Metabolism 
Everolimus is a substrate of CYP3A4 and PgP. Following oral administration, everolimus is the 
main circulating component in human blood. Six main metabolites of everolimus have been detected in human blood, including three monohydroxylated metabolites, two hydrolytic ring -
opened products, and a phosphatidylcholine conjugate of everolimus. These metabolites were also identified in animal species used in toxicity studies, and showed approximately 100- times less 
activity than everolimus itself .  In vitro, everolimus competitively inhibited the metabolism of 
CYP3A4 and was a mixed inhibitor of the CYP2D6 substrate dextromethorphan. The mean steady  
state Cmax following an oral dose of [ADDRESS_321433] been undertaken in cancer patients. Following the 
administration of a 3 mg single dose of radiolabelled everolimus in patients who were receiving cyclosporine, 80% of the radioactivity was recovered from the feces, while 5% was excreted in the urine. The parent substance was not detected in urine or feces. The mean elimination half -life of 
everolim us is approximately 30 hours. 
Abbreviated Title: Ph 1/2 Everolimus & Sorafenib  
Version Date:  06/15/18  Page 78 of 99 
 Patients with Renal Impairment 
Approximately 5% of total radioactivity was excreted in the urine following a 3 mg dose of [14C] -
labeled everolimus. In a population pharmacokinetic analysis which included 170 patients with 
adva nced cancer, no significant influence of creatinine clearance (25 – 178 mL/min) was detected 
on oral clearance (CL/F) of everolimus.  
Patients with Hepatic Impairment 
The average AUC of everolimus in eight subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child -Pugh 
class B) was twice that found in eight subjects with normal hepatic function. AUC was positively 
correlated with serum bilirubin concentration and with prolongation of prothrombin time and negatively correlated with serum albumin concentration. A dose r eduction for patients with Child -
Pugh class B hepatic impairment is recommended. Everolimus should not be used in patients with severe (Child -Pugh class C) hepatic impairment as the impact of severe hepatic impairment on 
everolimus exposure has not been as sessed.  
Effects of Age and Gender 
In a population pharmacokinetic evaluation in cancer patients, no relationship was apparent 
between oral clearance and patient age or gender.  
Ethnicity  
Based on a cross-study comparison, Japanese patients (n = 6) had on average exposures that were higher than non -Japanese patients receiving the same dose.  Based on analysis of population 
pharmacokinetics, oral clearance (CL/F) is on average 20% higher in Black patients than in Caucasians.  The significance of these differences on the safety and efficacy of everolimus in Japanese or Black patients has not been established. 
 Administration:  
Everolimus should be taken whole by [CONTACT_78141] a full glass of water as instructed by [CONTACT_093]. Everolimus should be taken by [CONTACT_941] p atient in a fasting state or with no more than a 
light fat- free meal. Patients should take their tablets at the same time of the day and at the same 
time in relation to meals. Patients should avoid eating grapefruit and/or grapefruit juice for the entire d uration of the study.  All patients should be instructed to contact [CONTACT_087]/she 
is unable to take the study drug as prescribed for any reason.

 Unused or defective agent:  Refer to the detailed instructions described in S ection 
[IP_ADDRESS] below. 
 Agent Storage and Accountability  
The investigator is responsible for the proper and secure physical storage and record keepi[INVESTIGATOR_264297]. S pecifically, the investigator must:   
• Maintain a careful record of the receipt, use and final disposition of all investigational agents received, using the NCI Agent Accountability Record Form (DARF), http://ctep.cancer.gov/forms/index.html
.   
• Store the agent in a secure location, accessible to only authorized personnel, preferably in the pharmacy.  
Abbreviated Title: Ph 1/2 Everolimus & Sorafenib  
Version Date:  06/15/18  Page 79 of 99 
 • Maintain appropriate storage of the investigational agent to ensure the stability and 
integrity of the ag ent. 
• Return any unused investigational agents at the completion of the study or upon notification that an agent is being withdrawn. 
The intent of the agent accountability procedures described in this section is to assist the investigator in making certain that agents received from BTTC are used only for patients entered onto an approved protocol. The record keepi[INVESTIGATOR_264298].  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] BTTC Procedures for Agent Accountability and Storage  
• Each investigational agent should be stored separately by [CONTACT_990]. If an agent is used for more than one protocol, there should be separate physical storage for each protocol. Remember that agents are provided and accounted for on a protocol- by-protocol basis. 
• Each agent should be accounted for separately by [CONTACT_990]. If an agent is used for more 
than one protocol, there should be a separate Drug Accountability Record Form (DARF) 
for each protocol, http://ctep.cancer.gov/forms/index.html
. There should be a separate 
DARF for each agent in a multi-agent protocol. 
• Separate accountability forms should be maintained for each different strength or dosage 
form of a particular agent (e.g., an agent with a 1- mg vial and a 5 -mg vial would require a 
different DARF for the 1 -mg vial than for the 5- mg vial).  
• The DARF has been designed for use at each location where agents  are stored, e.g., main 
pharmacy, satellite pharmacy, physician's office, or other dispensing areas.  
• The DARF is also designed to accommodate both dispensing records and other agent transaction documentation (e.g., receipt of agent, returns, broken vials, etc.). A copy of the DARF may be found at http://ctep.cancer.gov/forms/index.html
. 
• Unauthorized inter -institutional transfer of BTTC investigational agents from one 
participating  institution to anothe r is not permitted.  For some protocols the lead 
institution may enter into contractual agreements to forward agents to participating institutions (see BTTC Operations Manual). 
Verification of Compliance 
Investigators are reminded that compliance with procedures to ensure proper agent usage will be reviewed during site visits conducted under the monitoring program. Specifically, site visitors will check that the agent accountability system is being maintained, and will spot -check the agent 
accountability re cords by [CONTACT_264361]' medical records to verify that the 
agents were administered to a patient entered in the recorded protocol  
 Returning or destroying unused and/or defective Agent:  
Investigators/Designees should make every effort to minimize the amount of agent ordered and 
returned unused, (e.g. limit inventories to an 8 week supply or less). Investigators/Designees must return unused supplied agent as directed in the protocol when:  
Abbreviated Title: Ph 1/2 Everolimus & Sorafenib  
Version Date:  06/15/18  Page 80 of 99 
 • The agent is no longer required because the study is completed .  
• Agent is outdated. Investigators/designees should only return outdated agents with a firm 
expi[INVESTIGATOR_264299].  
• The agent is damaged or unfit for use . Investigators/designees should contact [CONTACT_264362], (e.g. loss of refrigeration or exposure to elevated temperatures). Do NOT return broken vials. Broken 
vials should be destroyed at  the clinical  site.  Follow the appropriate agent accountability 
guidelines.  
General Guidelines   
• Regulations require that all agents received be returned to the supplier for accountability 
and disposition.  
• Return only unused vials/bottles. Do NOT return opened or partially used vials/bottles 
unless specifically requested otherwise in the protocol.  
• Return only supplied agents. Do NOT ship agents received from other sources to the 
supplier.

11.0   MULTICENTER PROCEDURES  
 GENERAL PROCEDURES  
The BTTC Operations Manual and Data Submission Forms, on file at all BTTC institutions, 
document the data management and quality assurance programs for this collaboration.  BTTC institutions will follow the guidelines as addressed below and throughout this protocol. 
 PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATORS  
The principal investigator(s) will be responsible for the conduct of the study and monitoring its progress.  The responsibility for all reports and forms required by [CONTACT_264366](s). 
 PROCEDURES FOR SITE REGISTRATION  
Before an institution may begin participating in a BTTC protocol, they must complete the following steps: 
• Submit all required regulatory documents to the BTTC Coordinating Center  as outlined 
in the BTTC Operations Manual 
• Participate in a site initiation visit, webcast, or conference call  
• Receive training regarding study specific CRF’s and/or databases 
After these requirements have been fulfilled, the participating institution will receive by [CONTACT_6791], e -
mail, or hard copy memo a Site Activation Notification.  Once the Site Activation Notification has been recei ved, the participating institution may begin to register patients to the protocol. 
  INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW   
Each cooperating center will submit the protocol to its own IRB.  Documentation of the IRB approval will be forwarded to the BTTC Coordinating Center  before a patient from that institution 
can be registered on protocol.  No changes in the protocol will be allowed unless approved by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_264300]. 
 PROTOCOL REVISIONS AND CLOSURE  
Non life -threatening revisions : BTTC investigators will receive written notification of protocol 
revisions regarding non life- threatening events.

* asterisk denotes strong inhibition/ induction  
Please note:  
- strong inhibitor implies that it can cause ≥5-fold increase in AUC or ≥80% 
decrease in clearance of sensitive CYP substrates  
- moderate inhibitor implies that it can cause 2 to 5 -fold increase in AUC values 
or 50- 80% decrease in clearance  of sensitive CYP substrates.  
(Distinction is not always categ orical as interaction can vary according to 
conditions). 
1. Macrolide antibiotics:  Azithromycin is not a CYP3A substrate. It may therefore be 
employed where antibiotherapy with a macrolide is desirable in a patient being 
treated with everolimus  
2. Statins: Atorvastatin and pravastatin may be associated with everolimus, since a PK 
interaction study has shown that there is no relevant PK interaction.

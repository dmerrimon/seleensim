BIOZEK Final 4.0 – June [ADDRESS_1150447] is unaware of 
infection (asymptomatic). Epi[INVESTIGATOR_426476] -symptomatic and 
asymptomatic transmission of virus has driven the current epi[INVESTIGATOR_901]1. Antigen tests have a great 
potential for screening asymptomatic people2. To limit outbreaks, testing is needed to identify as 
many individuals who are transmitting infection as quickly as possible. Antigen Tests have the 
potential to readily identify an individual who is at or near p eak infection. Rapid Tests, while less 
sensitive, perform best during the early stages of COVID -19 infection; when viral load and 
potential for spread is high.  
 
There is an unmet need to provide broad testing that can serve high risk and low resource 
communities. The FDA’s authorization for antigen tests for home use is helpi[INVESTIGATOR_426477]’ access to testing, reducing the burden on laboratories and test su pplies3. The Biozek 
Antigen Rapid Test can be easily performed by [CONTACT_426486] 15 
minutes. The increased potential for repeated testing, remote or at home testing, could help 
contain the COVID -19 pandemic.  
 
3. Background  
_____________________________________________________________________________  
 
In December 2019, an outbreak emerged identifying a novel coronavirus, severe acute 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_6507] 2 (SARS -CoV -2). The World Health Organization (WHO) 
declared it a global pandemic in March 2020.   Testing in the U.S. appeared to be insufficient for 
optimal early containment of the virus. With the resurgence of the disease  (COVID -19), the U.S. 
has recently seen the highest number of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_426478]4. Given the continued community transmission of 
SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_1150448] polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test is used to diagnose 
COVID -[ADDRESS_1150449] could potentially end the spread of COVID -19.

To assess subject’s performance to collect samples and conduct BIOZEK COVID -[ADDRESS_1150451].  
 
As shown in illustration above, the specimen (A) migrates via capi[INVESTIGATOR_426481] (B). COVID -[ADDRESS_1150452] region (C). The formation of a 

8 
BIOZEK Final 4.0 – June [ADDRESS_1150453] region indicates a positive result (C). The absence of a colored line 
in the test zones suggests a negative result. In the control zone of the membrane, immobilized 
reagents capture colored conjugate regardless of test spec imen composition. The resulting visible 
colored band (D) confirms the control  line.

BIOZEK Final 4.0 – June [ADDRESS_1150456] Steps:  
 
Biozek Covid -[ADDRESS_1150457]  
Specimen Collection  - Nasopharyngeal Swab 
 
1. Insert a provided sterile swab into the nostril of the patient carefully, reaching the surface of 
the posterior nasopharynx.  
2. Swab over the surface of the posterior nasopharynx gently. 3. Withdraw the sterile swab from 
the nasal cavity.  
 
 
Nasal Swab Specimen Collection  
1. Insert a sterile swab less than one inch (about 2 cm) into a nostril (until resistance is met at the 
turbinate).  
2. Rotate the swab [ADDRESS_1150458] the nasal wall. Using the same swab  repeat the collection 
procedure with the second nostril.  
3. Withdraw the sterile swab, avoid excess volume and high -viscous nasal discharge.  

10 
BIOZEK Final 4.0 – June 1 , 2021  
  
Caution: If the swab stick breaks during specimen collection, repeat specimen collection with a 
new swab.  
 
Specimen Extraction –Nasopharyngeal  Swab  
Only the extraction buffer provided in this kit is to be used for specimen extraction.  
1. Peel off the sealing on the extraction tube with extraction buffer inside.  
2. Place the swab specimen into the extraction buffer, for better mixture and extraction to release 
the antigen, rotate the swab for approximately [ADDRESS_1150459] 
waste.  
4. Fit the tip onto the top of the extraction tube. Use extracted sample solution as final sample for 
testing as soon as poss ible. 
 
 
NOTE: The storage of the extracted specimen is stable for 2 hours at room temperature or 24 
hours at 2 -8°C. 
 
Testing Procedure – Nasopharyngeal Swab  
Allow the test cassette, extracted sample solution and/or controls to equilibrate to room 
temperature (15 -30°C) prior to testing.  
1. Remove the test cassette from the sealed foil pouch and use it within one hour. Best results 
will be obtained if the test is performed immediately after opening the foil pouch.  
2. Shake the extracted sample solution to mix it w ell. Invert the sample extraction tube and add 3 
drops of the Extracted Sample Solution (approx.75 -100μL) to the specimen well(S) of the 

11 
BIOZEK Final 4.0 – June 1 , 2021  
 cassette. Start the timer.  
3. Wait for the red line(s) to appear and read the result at 15 minutes. Do not interpret the result 
after 20 minutes.  
 
 
Interpretation of results - Nasopharyngeal Swab  
POSITIVE:  * Two red lines appear. One red line should be in the control region (C) and another 
red line should be in the test region (T). Positive result in the test region indicates detection of 
COVID -19 antigens in the sample. *NOTE: Red color line intensity in t he test region (T) will 
vary based on the amount of COVID -[ADDRESS_1150460] region (T) should be considered positive.  
 
NEGATIVE:  One red line appe ars in the control 
region (C). No apparent red line appears in the test 
region (T) indicates a negative COVID -[ADDRESS_1150461] result.  
 
INVALID:  No red line appears in the control region 
(C). Insufficient specimen volume or incorrect 
procedural techniques are the most likely reasons for control line failure. Review the procedures 
and repeat the test with a new cassette. If the problem persists, discontinue using the test kit 
immediately and contact [CONTACT_828946] r.

 SYNOPSIS 
 
 
Study Title:  A phase IIa, multicenter, double blind, placebo controlled, randomized 
clinical trial to assess safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of 
Rifaximin Delayed -Release (Rifaximin- EIR) in patients with 
moderate -to-severe papulopustular rosacea  
Study Code:  RE-ROS2002-2021 
Study Centre(s):    Approximately [ADDRESS_109950] spectrum oral antibiotic 
currently used to treat specific intestinal infections. Rifaximin -EIR is a 
delayed release formulation of Rifaximin that contains enteric- coated 
microgranules of Rifaximin.  
The new formula tion used in this trial, Rifaximin- EIR 250mg tablet (not 
yet on the market), has be en developed to optimize Rifaximin 
intestinal concentration and therapeutic effect. 
Rationale and 
Objective s: Rosacea is a common chronic inflammatory relapsing-remitting skin 
condition almost exclusively affecting the central area of the face and the eyes.
 
Based on its main clinical manifestations rosacea has been classically 
divided into the following four subtypes: i) erythematotelangectic, ii) 
papulopustular, iii) phymatous, and iv ) ocular. Recent modifications of 
international clinical guidelines  however have focused on individual 
features rather than combination  of features. This contemporary 
“phenotype ” approach is based on two rosacea features that are 
independently diagnostic (persistent central facial erythema and 
phyma), and other major features that are diagnostic when in 
combination  (i.e. papules and pustules, facial telangiectasia excluding 
alar involvement, transient central facial erythema, otherwise known 
as flushing, and specific ocular manifestations). 
Preliminary  evidence suggests that treatment with rifaximin , a poorly 
absorbed oral antibiotic drug may be beneficial in patients with 
rosacea , specifically in those with papulopustular phenotype. 
  
The objective of this study is twofold: 
1) to explore the safety and efficacy of two do ses of oral 
Rifaximin delayed- release (750mg/day and 1500mg/day) 
administered t.i.d. for 30 days versus placebo in adults with 
moderate-to-severe papulopustular rosacea.   
2) in a sub-group of patients, to assess the pharmacokinetics 
(PK) of the 750mg/daily and 1500mg daily dose of Rifaximin-
EIR 250mg administered using a t.i.d. schedule.  
Phase  IIa 
Experimental 
design:  This is Proof of Concept, phase IIa, multicenter, double-blind, 
placebo -controlled, randomized clinical trial.

 Two hundred one (201) eligible subjec ts are planned to participate in 
the main study while a subgroup of 18 -36 (a minimum of 6 and a 
maximum of 12 subjects per arm) are planned to participate in the PK 
sub-study. Patients participating in the PK study will be randomly 
selected from the whole population.  
 
At randomization visit, subjects will be 1:1:[ADDRESS_109951] 
(L-BT) status, i.e. negative (L-BT result with H 2 ≤10 ppm by 90 
minutes compared to time 0) vs. positive (L -BT H 2 >10 ppm) and PK 
sub-study participation (yes or not). 
 
Subjects participating in the PK sub -study, at Day 30 will stay 
overnight to complete the PK assessments.   
Venous blood samples for PK analysis will be collected on: 
x Day 1: Pre1st dose, and at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, [ADDRESS_109952] 
dosing. 
x Day 30: Pre-dose (single dose in the morning), and at 0.5, 1, 
1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, [ADDRESS_109953] dosing.  
 
Prospective participants can be recruited using two different 
strategies:  
x social media recruitment;  
x on-site recruitment  
Based on the recruitment strategy, subjects will follow a different path 
(Study Schedule A [social medi a recruitment] or B [on-site 
recruitment]).  
 
A - Social media recruitment  
Specific advertisements targeted to  papulopustular rosacea subjects 
posted in selected social media will re -direct subjects interested in 
participating in the study to a dedicated study website.  
Remote data recording (V0): In a dedicated study website, a 
prospective participant  will be asked to:  
x review a concise study description, 
x provide online pre-screening informed consent,  
x provide contact [CONTACT_8972],  
x provide demographics (e.g., age, gender, etc.), 
x complet e an online medical history and concomitant 
medication questionnaire,  
x upload either three pi[INVESTIGATOR_99781] (one frontal and two

 lateral [right and left side] photos) or a short video of the face.  
Central Reader Validation :  
This task will be performed no later than 2 working days after V0. A 
Central reader ( expert dermatologist ) will: 
x check preliminary compliance with inclusion/exclusion criteria 
based on the 
o review of personal and clinic al data (including medical 
history, concomitant medications etc.) posted on  the 
website,   
o review of patient’s images downloaded on the website,  
x confirm the preliminary eligibility of pre- screened candidates 
and refer them via a dedicated website to the clinical team . 
Phone contact [CONTACT_1155] :  
This task will be performed no later than [ADDRESS_109954], a clinic visit will be 
scheduled  (V1).  
 
On the Screening visit (V1) the Site Investigator will conduct formal 
informed consent process and proceed with the procedures foreseen 
by [CONTACT_99816] . All subsequent visits (Randomization visit, V2; E nd of 
Treatment visit, V 3; End of Study visit, V4) will be identical for both 
recruitment paths (social media and on site) . 
 
B - On-site recruitment  
Subjects presenting at the Investigational Site with moderate or 
severe papulopustular rosacea will be informed about the possibility to participate in 
the trial and if they are interested the Investigator will 
provide further information on the study and, if the subject is 
interested to participate, he will schedule the Screening visit (V1). All 
other visits will be performed as the social media recruitment path 
(see above) . 
 
Number of 
Subjects:  As described in Section 16.1 (Det ermination of Sample Size), two 
hundred one ( 201) eligible subjects (67 per arm) with moderate-to-
severe papulopustular rosacea , with a cap of 33 subjects per arm 
having negative L -BT at screening (i.e., a test showing an increase 
≤10 ppm of H 2 by 90 minutes comp ared to time 0) are planned to be 
enrolled . 
Plasma samples will be collected in a sub -group of 6- 12 subjects 
(minimum and maximum, respectively)  per arm for pharmacokinetics 
assessments.

 Full Analysis Set (FAS), defined as all patients in the SAF who have 
at least one post -baseline measurement for any primary endpoint.  
Modifie d Full Analysis Set (mFAS), defined as all patients in the FAS 
excluding the initial 30 patients randomized. 
Per Protocol Set (PPS), defined as all patients in the FAS who fulfil 
the study protocol requirements wi th no major deviations that may 
affect study results.  
PK Set, defined  as all randomized patients who received at least one 
dose of Rifaximin and had a suitable PK profile.  
Analysis of the efficacy endpoints will be performed on the FAS and 
the PPS. Results on the FAS will be considered primary.  Results on 
the PPS population will be used as supportive. 
Analysis of the safety and tolerability endpoints will be performed on 
the SAF.  
Efficacy Statistical Analysis  
 
Each active group will be comp ared with the placebo group.  
Statistical tests  will be performed at the two-sided α =0.[ADDRESS_109965] co -primary efficacy endpoint (i.e.: mean change from 
Baseline in number of inflammatory lesions at Day 30) will be 
analysed  by [CONTACT_99819] (ANCOVA) model, 
with change from Baseline to Day 30 as dependent variable, 
treatment group and stratification factor as explicative factors , and 
baseline number of inflammatory lesions as covariate . The adjusted 
mean differences will be presented  with 95% CIs and p-values. 
The second co -primary efficacy endpoint (i .e.: percent of patients 
showing treatment success (IGA score of 0 or 1) with at least a 2-
grade improvement from baseline at Day 30) will be analysed by 
[CONTACT_3553] a stratified Cochran Mantel- Haenszel (CMH) chi square 
test. The Breslow-Day test for stratified tables will be applied. A two-
sided 95% CI for difference in success rate between the treatment 
groups (each active group vs placebo) will also be computed.  
The primary statistical analysis on the FAS will be performed 
according to the actual treatment received.  
In addition, two sensitivity analyses will be implemented:  
x The first by [CONTACT_99820] “randomized 
treatment”, as originally planned  
x The second on the mFAS according to the “randomized 
treatment”.

x C max, Tmax, AUC 0-tau, t1/2;  
x Accumulation factor after the last dose;  
Rifaximin -EIR individual and mean plasma concentrations at each 
sampling time point will be pres ented by [CONTACT_99821], geometric means, 
medians, quartiles, ranges, standard  deviations and coefficients of 
variation (arithmetic and geom etric). Individual and mean 
concentrations versus time will be plotted on linear and log -linear 
scales. Descriptive statistics and graphs will be also performed for the 
PK parameters.  
Safety analysis  
With reference to the safety parame ters, standard statistical analyses 
will be conducted on vital signs, physical examination, laboratory 
parameters and AEs at the relevant visits.

face and the eyes. This condition affects 0.09 to 20% of the population (depending on the 
geographical areas and genetic pred isposition) with typi[INVESTIGATOR_99794] 30 to 50 years although 
can be found also in younger adults. Rosacea is slightly more prevalent among women, populations 
of Northern Europe and/or Celtic heritage, and less frequent among Asians and African Americans 
(Steinhoff et al., 2011). In a recent systematic  review using available global data on rosacea 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_623] (including 32 studies, 41 population s, more than 26 million individuals), the global 
prevalence of rosacea has been estimated to be 5.5% . (Gether et al., 2018). 
Based on its main clinical manifestations rosacea has been classically divided into the following four 
phenotypes: 1) erythematotelangjectatic, 2) papulopu stular, 3) phymatous, and 4) ocular (Wilkin et 
al 2014, Steinhoff et al., 2013).  
Recently, a phenotype system has been develope d to address shortcomings of the previous 
diagnosis and subtypi[INVESTIGATOR_99795]. With the phenotype system, diagnosis of rosacea can 
be established by [CONTACT_716]: either fixed centrofacial erythema or phymatous changes 
independently; or in their absence, the presence  of any 2 major features (flushing, papules and 
pustules, telangiectasias and specific ocular manifestations). Minor features (burning, stinging, 
edema, dryness, scaling) are not diagnostic (Gallo et al. 2018, Tan J et. al. 2017)). The advantage 
of the latter is that it allows diagnosis and trea tment more closely based on  signs and symptoms as 
well as pathophysiology (Buddenkotte and Steinhoff, 2018). 
While the pathogenesis of rosacea is still largely unknown, there is convincing evidence that several 
genetic and environmental factors may contribute to  the development of rosacea, such as adaptive 
and innate immune dysregulation, neurovascular changes, and chronic inflammation (Holmes and 
Steinhoff., 2017). Among the environmental factors, microorganisms and/or their products may have 
an important part in the genesis of the disease: Helicobacter pylori , Staphylococcus epi[INVESTIGATOR_77353] , 
Chlamydia pneumoniae , Bacillus olenorius and, more convincingly, Demodex folliculorum , a skin 
parasite, have been hypothesized  to have a significant role in the pathogenesis of rosacea 
(Lazaridou et al., 2011), particul arly in patients with papules an d pustules, the phenotype with the 
most intense inflammatory component (Holmes and Steinhoff., 2017). Thus, involvement of bacteria 
in the pathogenesis is possibly one of the reasons why antibiotics have been traditionally proven to 
be effective in patients with rosacea, particularly  for the papulopustular ph enotype. In addition, the 
anti-inflammatory capacity of certain antibiotics su ch as tetracyclines, doxycycline and minocycline, 
have been shown to reduce inflammatory mediato rs associated with rosacea. Systemic and topi[INVESTIGATOR_99796], systemic tetracyclines and macrolides and others have been used for moderate-to-
severe forms of disease, although slow-release 40mg doxycycline (a member of the tetracyclines 
family) is the only systemic antibiotic approved for this indication. However, since long-term 
treatment is needed in more seve re patients, up to several months , the risk of adverse events and 
antibiotic resistance is high. at least at higher do sages. Potential other side effects of the antibiotics 
used in rosacea are summarized in a Cochrane re view and include esophagitis, colitis, facial 
melasma (hard-to-treat), for example (van Zuuren 2015). 
Rosacea can be triggered by [CONTACT_99825], hot/spi[INVESTIGATOR_99797], chemicals, UV radiation, 
exercise, and bacteria and/or microbial products  (Holmes and Steinhoff., 2017, Steinhoff 2013, 
Yamasaki 2007). In addition, it ha s been suggested that quantitative changes of the small intestinal

 microflora, such as small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) may also trigger rosacea (Parodi et 
al. 2008, Weinstock and Steinho ff 2013, Drago et al. 2016).  
SIBO is a heterogeneous syndrome and a quantitative change of the gut microbiota characterized 
by [CONTACT_99826]. SIBO can be assessed 
using lactulose hydrogen/methane (H 2/CH 4) breath test (L-BT) or glucose hydrogen/methane 
(H2/CH 4) breath test (G-BT).   
L-BT is a well-established non-invasive, office-based  test for assessing malabsorption/fermentation 
of carbohydrates in the small intestine as a consequence of local overgrowth of bacteria. An 
increased number of intestinal bacteria results in  increased carbohydrate fermentation in the gut, 
leading to the increased production of H 2 (and/or CH 4), eventually released with the expi[INVESTIGATOR_99798]. Breath testing consists of timed and standardized measurement of exhaled H 2 and CH 4 after 
the ingestion of a solution of water and lactulose. Although, classically, lactulose breath testing has 
been performed using a 4-hour collection time (Gas barrini et al., 2009), a recent consensus (Rezaie 
et al., 2017) and the American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) clinical guideline (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_99799]., 
2020) suggest that a 2-hour procedure is sufficient to detect a significant abnormal colonization of 
the small intestine. Lactulose breath test is usua lly performed by [CONTACT_99827] 15 
minutes for 120 minutes (Rez aie et al., 2017). Current guidance (R ezaie et al., 2017, Pi[INVESTIGATOR_99799]. 
2020) recommend a rise of >20 ppm of H 2 and/or >10 ppm of CH 4 by 90 minutes as diagnostic for 
SIBO. However, a threshold of >10 ppm of H 2 has also been used in clinical studies and associated 
with rosacea (Parodi et al., 2008), suggesting that  also lower degrees of quantitative microbiota 
changes, with a rise of H 2-producing bacteria may trigger rosacea,  although not entirely meeting the 
current operational definition of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth. However, this need to be 
determined. 
A recent meta-analysis on the sensitivity and sp ecificity of L-BT and G-BT has been recently 
published (Losurdo et al. 2020). This metanalysi s included 4 studies performed with L-BT meeting 
the pre-specified inclusion criteria. The results showed that the pooled sensitivity of L-BT was 42.0% 
and pooled specificity was 70.6%. Slightly better results were obtain ed with G-BT (sensitivity 54% 
and specificity 82%).  
Rifaximin 
Rifaximin is a semi-syntetic Rifamycin-derivate with a large antimicrobial spectrum covering gram-
positive and gram-negative bacteria as well as aerobes and anaerobes (e.g. Clostridium  and 
Bacteroides ). Rifaximin is a member of the rifamycin class and, like the other components of the 
group, it inhibits the RNA-synthesis binding to the beta-subunit of the DNA-dependent RNA enzyme 
of bacteria.  
Rifaximin is an original molecule discovered and patented by [CONTACT_99828] S.p.A. (a Company 
currently merged into Alfasigma S.p.A.) in 1980; it was first registered in Italy in 1985 as 200 mg 
tablets and 2 g/100 mL granules for oral suspen sion (60 mL bottle) and marketed in 1987.  
Rifaximin is currently approved in 68 countries and marketed, under several trade names, for the 
treatment of bacterial intestinal infections (200-4 00 mg every 6-8 hours) and for the treatment of 
hepatic encephalopathy (H E) (400 mg). In 2015, Rifaximin 550 mg three times daily was approved 
by [CONTACT_99829] (FDA) for treating IBS with diarrhea (IBS-D) in adults. 
The approval of rifaximin in the IBS-D setting is  based on the existing understanding that one 
possible underlying cause of IBS is perturbation of the microbiome.

 Overall, the pharmacokinetic profile of Rifaximin-EIR is similar to that of the marketed form of 
Rifaximin, which has been extensively assessed in studies of healthy volunt eers and patients with 
gastrointestinal diseases (Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, pouchitis, IBS) , after single and multiple 
oral doses.

and administered three times daily (i .e. 750 mg daily, 250 mg t.i.d.), has not yet been assessed for 
the treatment of subjects with papulopustular rosace a. Moreover, the bioavailability of Rifaximin-EIR 
at doses of 750 mg or 1500 mg daily (i.e. 750 mg da ily, 250 mg t.i.d. or 1500 mg daily, 500 mg t.i.d., 
respectively) in subjects with papulopustular rosacea is not known. 
  
This study is therefore aimed at: 
1) evaluating the safety and the efficacy of two different doses of Rifaximin-EIR 250 mg tablets 
(250 mg t.i.d. and 500 mg t.i.d.), administered fo r 30 days in subjects with moderate-to-severe 
papulopustular rosacea;  
2) evaluating the pharmacokinetics of these two doses of Rifaximin-EIR in a sub-group of 
subjects.  
 
Data collected with this study will provide key inform ation to be used in the development of Rifaximin-
EIR 250mg tablet in rosacea. 
 
 
5.1 Co-primary efficacy endpoint 
The following co-primary efficacy endpoints will be clinically assessed by [CONTACT_737]: 
1) Absolute change from baseline in number of rosacea inflammatory lesions (papules and 
pustules) at the end of treatment (Day 30) AND 
2) Percent of subjects showing treatment success, defined as an IGA score of 0 (clear) or 1 
(almost clear) with at least a 2-grade improvemen t from baseline at the end of treatment (Day 
30).

3 Moderate Several small or large papules/pustules 
4 Severe Numerous small and/or large papules/pustules 
 
5.2 Secondary endpoints 
Secondary efficacy endpoints: 
1) Mean change from Baseline (V2) in number of inflammatory lesions (papules and pustules) 
at V4. 
2) Percent of participants showing treatment success (i.e. IGA score of 0 or 1) at V3, V4. 
3) Percent of participants with IGA score of 0 (clear) at V3, V4.   
4) Change from Baseline (V2) in the following rosacea additional features at V3, V4.

 6. OVERALL STUDY DESIGN AND PLAN 
This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, phase IIa clinical trial. 
As described in Section 16.1 (D etermination of Sample Size), two hundred one (201) eligible 
subjects are planned to participate in the main study while a subgroup of minimum 18 and maximum 
36 subjects are planned to participate in the PK su b-study. A maximum of 12 (minimum 6) subjects 
per arm is established for the PK sub-study.  
At randomization visit (V2, Day 1), subjects will be 1:1:1 randomized to receiving any of the two daily 
doses of active treatment or placebo. TID doses of the assigned treatment will be administered from Day 1 to Day 29. On Day 30 (V3) just the first da ily dose will be administ ered, and PK assessed.  
Patients will be stratified at randomization based on their L-BT status (negative vs. positive) and PK 
sub-study participation (yes or not). A negative L-BT is defined as a test showing an increase ≤10 
ppm of H
2 by 90 minutes comp ared to time 0.  
 
The primary endpoint will be evaluated at end of treatment (V3, Day 30).   
Subjects participating in the PK sub-study at V3 (D ay 30) will stay overnight to complete the PK 
assessments.   
Venous blood samples for PK anal ysis will be collected on: 
x Day 1: Pre1st dose, and at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, [ADDRESS_109991] dosing. 
x Day 30 (V3): Pre dose (single dose in the morning) , and at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 22, 
24, [ADDRESS_109992] dosi ng. Blood sampling will continue until Day 31 as appropriate.  
 
Details on the procedures performed with the diff erent recruitment options are described in Section 
11 (Study Procedures). 
 Participants will be enrolled at ap proximately 40 US Centers in [LOCATION_003].

two dosages of Rifaximin-EIR in patients with moderate-to-severe  papulopustular rosacea. While 
not always the use of placebo is ethically acceptable, in this specific trial the use a placebo arm is deemed ethically acceptable according to the art.  33. Of the Declaration of Helsinki and the 
EMEA/[ZIP_CODE]/01. In fact, withholding/postponing the use of an established intervention for rosacea 
of approximately one month does not “entail any additional risks of any irreversible harm to the 
participant”.  
Participants in the placebo arm, the 33% of the study sample, might be exposed to a temporary 
discomfort in terms of a lack of improvement or even a slight worsening of the symptoms.  
Although, preliminary evidence shows that Rifaximin may be beneficial particul arly in patients with 
rosacea and quantitative microbiota changes, considering the methodological limits of L-BT testing 
and that the role of microbiota quantitative and qualitative composition in the pathogenesis of rosacea has not yet been fully clarified, accord ing to the FDA recommendation, patients with 
negative L-BT will also be enrolled. In fact, it cannot be excluded that the benefit of Rifaximin in patients with rosacea could be medi ated by [CONTACT_99830]. 
In any case, patients can decide to withdraw from the clinical study at any time with no penalties.  
Similarly, the Investigator can decide to withdraw the patient in his/her best interest, at any time, to 
pursue alternate treatments or no treatment at all.

 8. BENEFIT-RISK EVALUATION 
Pharmacological and efficacy studies with R ifaximin (see Investigator’s Brochure) have shown that 
the benefits of Ri faximin include: 
x The negligible absorption of Rifaximin (less than 1%) means it has an excellent safety profile 
and can be administered at high  doses for long period time. 
x No potential for either inhibition or inductio n of human hepatic cytoch rome P450 at expected 
clinical plasma concentrations. 
x No drug-drug interactions with oral contraceptiv es at expected clinical plasma concentrations. 
x Rifaximin can be administered with or without food. 
x A large antimicrobial spectrum covering most gram-positive and -negative bacteria, including 
aerobes and anaerobes and therefore good activi ty against the microflora normally present in 
both the small intestine and in the colon. 
x Rifaximin is widely used in gastroenterology (i.e. Traveller’s diarrhoea, Hepatic Encephalopathy 
and Irritable Bowel Syndrome  with diarrhoea IBS-D). 
x Bioavailability studies with Rifaximin-EIR 1200 mg (3 x 400 mg tablet) administered TID for 7 
days showed that absorption is negligible in subjects with Crohn’s Disease (CD) . Absorption is 
negligible also in subjects with IBS receiving Rifaximin 550 mg TID for 14 days. 
x Rifaximin works by [CONTACT_99831], rifaximin may reduce the uncontroll ed immune response to enteric bacteria. 
x Based on the available evidence summarized in a recent meta-analysis on 32 clinical trials 
through March 2015, Rifaximin is effective and sa fe in eradicating SIBO and resolving symptoms 
(overall success with an intention-to-treat: 70 .8%) (Gatta, 2017). According to Gatta and 
colleagues, SIBO eradication rates increase linea rly with increasing Rifaximin dose, in the 600-
to-1600 mg daily dose range. With regards to safety data, in the above-mentioned meta-analysis the 4.6% of SIBO patients treated with Rifaximin reported AEs, but only the 0.47% of them had to discontinue the therapy. 
x Data from randomized clinical studies, evalua ting the efficacy of Rifaximin 200 mg TID (1200 
md/day) in rosacea patient’s positive for SIBO, demonstrated that eradication of SIBO induced an almost complete regression of cutaneous le sions among patients achieving glucose breath 
test negativity after treatment (Parodi, 2008) (Weinstock, 2013) .  
 The safety of Rifaximin evaluated in clinical tria l and during post-marketing surveillance indicates 
that Rifaximin is extremely safe. In details: 
x The safety of Rifaximin-EIR has been evaluated in 6 studies, 3 Phase II studies involving 379 
patients with mild to moderate Crohn’s disease,  1 PK study on 18 healthy volunteers and 2 PK 
studies on 30 patients with active Crohn’s disease. The safety analys is has shown a favourable 
safety profile of Rifaximin-EIR in the treatment of mild to moderate active Crohn’s disease.  
x The safety of Rifaximin (200 mg or 550 mg fo rmulations) has been extensively established in 
approximately 7000 subjects enrolled in clin ical studies (IBS-D: 4020 subjects; Hepatic 
Encephalopathy: 697; Traveller’s Diarrhoea: 1527 ; healthy volunteers: 221) and of Rifaximin 
600 – 1800 mg in approximately 125 patients (rece iving rifaximin 1100 mg/day for 2 years),  
x Post-marketing experience confirme d that Rifaximin is extremely safe. 
  
Overall, in clinical trials (including those invest igating Rifaximin-EIR), nearly all adverse reactions 
recorded were uncommon (<1%). The most freque ntly reported adverse events were related to

 gastrointestinal, nervous, skin and general disorder s, in addition to those revealed by [CONTACT_99832]. 
The incidence of adverse events in people treated with rifaximin was comparable to or lower than 
that in the placebo-treated patients, as one would be expected from a non-absorbable antibiotic. In 
some of the cases, gastrointestinal adverse even ts recorded during clinical studies were also 
symptoms of the intestinal disease to be treated with the investigational drug. In addition to those identified during clinical  trials, further potential risks may include: 
x Cases of Clostridium Difficile  Associated Diarrhoea (CDAD) have been reported with Rifaximin 
use, ranging in severity from mild diarrhoea to fatal colitis. The potential association of Rifaximin treatment with CDAD and Ps eudomembranous Colitis (PMC) cannot be ruled out.  
x Allergic reactions have also been reported during post-approval use. Systemic absorption of 
Rifaximin is approximately 0.4% of the orally ad ministered dose; however, even these very low 
quantities are sufficient to trigger an allergic reaction, particularly in hypersensitive subjects. 
Therefore, serious unpredictable reactions such as anaphylactic shock or severe skin reactions may occur. 
x Cases of both increases and decreases in Intern ational Normalised Ratio (INR) with a temporal 
association with Rifaximin administ ration were reported in patien ts maintained on warfarin and 
Rifaximin with a temporal asso ciation with rifaximi n administration. Therefore, closer INR 
monitoring and/or dose adjustment of warfar in is required around the time of Rifaximin 
administration. 
x In healthy subjects, clinical drug interaction studies demonstrated that rifaximin did not 
significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of CYP3 A4 substrates, however, in hepatic impaired 
patients it cannot be excluded that Rifaxi min may decrease the exposure of concomitant 
CYP3A4 substrates administered (e.g. antiepil eptics, antiarrhythmics) , due to the higher 
systemic exposure with resp ect to healthy subjects.  
x In healthy subjects, co-administration of a single dose of cyclosporine (600 mg), a potent P-
glycoprotein inhibitor, with a single dose of Ri faximin (550 mg) resulted in 83-fold and 124-fold 
increases in Rifaximin mean C
max and AUC ∞. The clinical significance of this increase in systemic 
exposure is unknown. 
x There is no experience regard ing administration of Rifaximin to subjects affected by [CONTACT_99833][INVESTIGATOR_2513].  
 
Experts have agreed that the systemic absorption of  Rifaximin is too low to select resistant strains, 
and in fact, two recent surveys carried out in Italy, where Rifaximin has been widely used since 1987, 
found no evidence of development of resistance by M. tuberculosis  or N. meningitides . Therefore, 
the clinically relevant selection of cross-resistant M. tuberculosis  or N. meningitides  is considered 
not probable.   In summary, the properties of Rifaximin, including its broad range of activity against bacteria, the 
supposed immunomodulatory activity, its low systemic availability, the excellent safety profile, the clinical efficacy shown in Proof of Concept studies in the treatment of rosacea, support a positive 
risk/benefit ratio.

10.2.3 Storage, Dispensing, Use and Disposal of the compound during  and at the end of 
the study 
An adequate amount of Patient’s kits will be initia lly supplied to each study centre. According to the 
actual rate of recruitment of the centre , additional supplies will be performed. 
All investigational products must be kept in a locked place with restricted access and maintained 
under controlled temperature conditions at ≤ 25°C. Do not refrigerate. 
At visits V2, each eligible subject will receive a patient’s kit containing two “treatm ent bottles ”, 
covering the treatment necessary for [ADDRESS_110010] to people other than the enrolled 
subjects or the authorized study pers onnel in charge of distribute it. 
Under no circumstances, without written authorisation from the Sponsor, the Investigator is allowed 
to supply the study drug to other study centres (or Investigators working for other centres involved 
in the study). Similarly, the Investigator is not allowe d to or will not instruct people to use or handle 
the investigational drug in a way differen t from that described in this protocol. 
The investigational products should be stored safe ly and properly, and they must not be used after 
the expi[INVESTIGATOR_5695]. 
The investigational products will be self-administered by [CONTACT_102], following instruction provided 
by [CONTACT_99836].  
The final accountability records will reconcile shipment records with those of used and returned 
investigational product. Any discrepancy will be accounted for. All unused investigational products will be returned or destroyed locally, based on the lo cal regulation, but return and destruction will not 
occur until authorised by [CONTACT_1034]. 
 
10.3 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups / Randomisation 
A unique subject’s  identification number will be assigned to all subjects consenting to be enrolled in 
the study obtained concatenating the cent er number with the screening number.  
A subject who fails to meet the protocol eligibility crit eria will be identified as screening failure; his/her 
identification number will not be reallocated. 
Randomisation will occur at visit V2 after all baseli ne procedures have been performed and eligibility 
for the study has been confirmed. 
Participants will be randomised, on a 1:1:1 basis, to Rifaximin-EIR 250 mg three times a day (750 mg daily) for 29 consecutive days and Rifaximin-EIR 250 mg single dose on Day 30, Rifaximin-EIR 
500 mg three times a day (1500 mg daily) for 29 consecutive days
 and Rifaximin-EIR 500 mg single 
dose on Day 30, or placebo for 30 consecutive days. 
Blocks will be used to assure treatment balance.

 Patients will be stratified at randomization based on their L-BT status (negative vs. positive) and PK 
sub-study participat ion (yes or not). 
 
Randomization will occur throughout an IWR system integrated into the e-CRF.  
At V2, the randomization system will assign an individual Patient’s kit number based on a pre -defined 
randomisation list. 
The enrolment will be competitive.  Decoding of randomization in case of emergency is described in chapter 11.4. 
The subjects will be offered participation to the PK sub-study. If they agree, they will be randomized 
according to the relevant stratum maintaining treatment balance among groups; otherwise, they will 
enter the main study. 
 
10.4 Selection of Doses in the Study 
Based on the available evidence summarized in a recent meta-analysis, Rifaximin seems to be 
effective and safe for the treatment of intestin al dysbiosis (Gatta et al., 2017), a condition 
hypothesized triggering rosacea, showing a dose-response relationship in the dose-range between 
800 and 1600 mg per day (Gatta, 2017). 
Rifaximin-EIR [ADDRESS_110011] the minimum (750 mg daily) and 
maximum (1500 mg daily) doses that have been show n to act at pathophysiological level (e.g. SIBO 
eradication).  
In agreement with the published studies, the duration of treatment in this study will be 29 days for 
both the Rifaximin-EIR 1500 mg/daily and 750 mg/daily dosages plus Rifaximin-EIR 500mg or Rifaximin-EIR mg [ADDRESS_110012] udy drug intake from the morning of V2 (Day 1), 
immediately after randomization and preferably earl y in the morning (around 8:00 AM), taking one 
tablet from the bottle with white la bel and one tablet from the bottle with yellow label, as well as one 
tablet from the bottle of white label and one tablet from the bottle of yellow label in the afternoon 
(around 4:00 PM) as well as one tablet from the bottle of white label and on e tablet from the bottle 
of yellow label late in the evening (around 12:00 PM).  
Bottles with labels of different colours can contai n either Rifaximin-EIR [ADDRESS_110013] be performed at the 
investigational site in occasion of the randomizatio n visit (V2, Day 1), immediately after the first blood 
drawing (for PK analysis) and preferably early in th e morning (around 8:00 AM). Also, at V3 (Day 30) 
subjects participating in the PK sub-study will st ay overnight at the centre to complete the PK 
procedures.

compliance at each visit. 
To monitor treatment compliance, patients will be as ked to bring back the two bottles provided at the 
randomization visit (V2), incl uding all unused tablets.  
The investigational drug supplies, the unused returned investigational drug will be duly recorded in 
the drug accountability forms, as source documents, by [CONTACT_99837] e-CRFs. Any discr epancy must be clearly documented. 
A level of compliance >80% during the treatmen t period will be cons idered satisfactory.

 o At the screening visits, other 5 ml of blood (approximately) will be collected to perform a 
serum pregnancy test (serum huma n chorionic gonadotropin assay). 
 
PK assessment  Only for those subjects participating in the PK sub- study, additional 132 ml of blood will be drawn 
during the study for the followin g pharmacokinetic evaluations:  
x At randomization (V2, Day 1), sampling will be performed before and after the first morning 
dose of Rifaximin-EIR at the following time poin ts: immediately pre-dose and at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 
2, 3, 4, 6, [ADDRESS_110022]-dosing.  
x At the end of treatment (V3, Day 30), sampling  will be performed right before and after the 
morning dose of Rifaximin-EIR at the following time points: immediately pre-dose and at 0.5, 
1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, [ADDRESS_110023]-single dose at day 11 (the sampling 
started at V3 will end after ov ernight stay, as appropriate). 
PK samples handling procedures 
The whole process of blood sampling, processing and storage of plasma samples collected from the 
subjects participating in the PK sub-study is detailed below. 
Blood tube  A 6 mL Vacutainer tube (or equivalent) containing Na-Heparin 
as anticoagulant  
 
Blood handling and 
processing  Draw about 6 mL blood into the tu be (the first 0.5 mL of blood 
withdrawn via cannula will be discarded), invert tube gently to 
mix and place immediately in ice/water bath. Centrifuge at 4°C 
at 1500 g for 10 min within 1h from collection. 
Plasma aliquot 
volumes  
 Aliquot plasma evenly into two (2) polypropylene cryovial 
tubes. One aliquot should be retained at the site.  
Plasma storage 
conditions Store at below -65°C until transfer and ship on dry ice. 
Samples will be analyzed within 185 days from the date of collection. 
 
Urinalysis  
Urinalysis (visual examination (specific gravity, pH, protein, glucose, ketones, haemoglobin, nitrite [if 
available], bilirubin, urobilinogen, microscopic examination [if available] ) will be performed at the 
screening visit (V1), at the end of treatment visit (V3) and at the end of follow-up visit (V4) to assess systemic tolerability.  Urine pregnancy test will be performed on the sa mple of urines collected at V2, V3 and V4.  
  Lactulose breath test Lactulose Breath Test (L-BT) is a non-invasive test for assessing malabsorption/fermentation of 
carbohydrates in the small intestine as consequence of SIBO. Overgrowth of colonic bacteria results 
in increased carbohydrate fermentation in the gut, leading to a production of hydrogen (H
2) and 
methane (CH 4), eventually released with the expi[INVESTIGATOR_99807]. Breath testing consists of times and 
standardised measurement of exhaled H 2 and CH 4 after the ingestion of a solution of water and 
lactulose. Although classical L-BT has been perfo rmed using a 4-hour collection time (Gasbarrini et

 al. 2009), a recent consensus suggests that a 2-ho ur procedure is sufficient to detect a significant 
small intestine colonization (Rezaie et al. 2017).  
During the screening period (V1), L-BT will be performed to all subject recruited for participating to 
the clinical study within the last 2-weeks before randomization (V2). Lactulose breath test will be also 
repeated at the end of treatment (V3)  or at the Early Termination Visit (if applicable) within [ADDRESS_110024] performance (i.e. 
avoid complex carbohydrate rich diets one day before the test, 12-hours as fasting period, smoking 
and physical exercise were not allowed 2- hours before and during the test, etc.). 
Study investigators will be instructed on how to accurately inform subjects to perform L-BT.  
In summary, a first breath sample will be collected to evaluate the basal breath of H 2 level (in ppm) 
after a 12-hours of fasting. Thereafter, subjects will be asked to drink a 10-grams of lactulose 
solution. Subsequently, levels of breath H 2 and CH 4 will be estimated every 15-20 minutes for a total 
duration of 120 minutes.  
After timely delivery, H 2 and CH 4 levels will be determined by a centralised laboratory (Quintron). 
11.3.1 Handling of Biological Samples  
Blood and urine sample for hematology, chemical chemistry, and urinalysis will be handled according 
to a centralized laboratory procedure. Breath samples for centralized L-BT will be handled according 
to directions provided in a separate “Centralized Laborato ry Test Manual”. Detailed instructions for 
managing blood samples for PK analysis will be also provided in a separate “PK Laboratory Manual”.

([ADDRESS_110028] dose). The subjects will fill the diary information regarding gastrointestinal 
symptoms (IBS-SSS questionnaire) and dermatologic quality of life (DLQI questionnaire) every ten 
days from V2 to V4 (included). 
This e-PRO will be integrated in the electronic data capture system utilized for the collection of all 
the other study data. The clinical site staff will review periodically the e-PRO data collected and in 
case of missing data will be responsible for remi nding the subject about appropriate completion. The

 12. EFFICACY AND SAFETY ASSESSMENTS 
12.1 Assessment of efficacy 
Rifaximin-EIR has currently being investigated in a ph ase 2 trial in subjects with rosacea and positive 
L-BT at daily doses of 800mg (400 mg b.i.d.) and 16 00mg (800 mg b.i.d.). A lower dose of Rifaximin-
EIR, lower than those investigated in this ongoing trial (i.e. 250 mg t.i.d., overall 750mg daily), is 
planned to be moved forward in this indication. Howe ver, the effect on rosacea lesions of this lower 
dose, particularly when administered t.i.d., ha s not yet been assessed. Moreover, known the 
bioavailability of Rifaximin-EIR in patients with papulopustular rosa cea has not been investigated.  
This study is therefore aimed at: 
1) exploring the safety and efficacy of two dose s of oral Rifaximin-EIR (750 mg/day and 1500 
mg/day) versus placebo in adult subjects with moderate-to-severe papulopustular rosacea, 
and  
2) in a sub-group of subjects, evaluating the PK of two doses of Rifaximin-EIR 250 mg tablet 
(250 mg t.i.d. [750 mg/daily] and 500 mg t.i.d. [1500 mg/daily])  
administered t.i.d. for [ADDRESS_110029] morning dose on Day 30.  
Data collected with this study will provide key inform ation to be used in the development of Rifaximin-
EIR in rosacea. 
12.1.1 Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
Co-primary efficacy endpoint: 
The following co-primary efficacy endpoints will be clinically assessed by [CONTACT_737]:

Pharmacokinetic assessments  (PK sub-study only): 
12) Pharmacokinetics of the single dose (i.e. at Day [ADDRESS_110031] dose administration) and 
the repeated doses (i.e. at Day [ADDRESS_110032] dose) of Rifaximin-EIR 250 mg.  
 
Clinical assessment of rosacea lesions 
 
At each study visits (from V1 to V4 [or ETV]) the Investigators will perform a clinical assessment of the rosacea facial skin lesions. The foll owing evaluation will be performed:  
x Number of papules and pustules;  
x Presence and severity of erythema (absent=0, mild=1, moderate=2, severe=3); 
x Presence and severity of telangiectasia (absent=0, mild=1, moderate=2, severe=3);  
x Presence and severity of ocular manifestations (absent=0, mild=1, moderate=2, severe=3);  
x Presence and severity of phymatous changes (absent=0, mild=1, moderate=2, severe=3).   
The assessment will be performed in 3 areas of the face and reported in the Rosacea Patient Lesion Assessment form (see Appendix 4).    
Patients will be asked by [CONTACT_99844] a “ Pain, Burning or stinging and itching ” self -
evaluation at each study visits (from V1 to V4 [o r ETV]) using a 0-10 cm Visual Analogue Scale VAS) 
(see Appendix 5). 
Investigators will also be required to provide a global assessment using the Investigator 
Investigator’s Global Assessment (IGA) of Rosacea Severity (se e Appendix 1) as well as Modified 
IGA scales (see Appendices 2 and 3) to be reported in the Rosacea Patient Lesion Assessment form (Appendix 4).  
In order to standardize assessment, Investigators will be instructed on how to  perform the evaluation 
and visual aids with photographs of differe nt lesion severity will be provided.

 Five- point Investigator’s Global Assessment (IGA) Scale  
The Investigator’s Global Assessment (IGA) scoring system utilized in the study is a re -formatting of 
a Standardized Grading System used for grading of rosacea severity. The Standardized Grading 
System provides a widely used basic framework for disease quantification (see Appendix 1). 
Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) 
A Visual Analogue Scale is a psychometric measurin g tool meant to document  the characteristics of 
a symptom severity in individual patients and is used to obtain a statistically measurable 
classification of symptom severity. In the present study, a 10 cm VAS (a straight 10 cm horizontal 
line where the left- hand side end represents the presence of “no pain, stinging/burning or itching ” 
and the right-hand side end r epresents the “worst pain, stinging/ burning or itching ever 
experienced”) will  be used to document the presence/severity of pain, burning/stinging or itching in 
participants with rosacea. Patients will be instruct ed to mark on the line the point that they feel 
represents their perception of their current state. The measure (in cm and millimetres) of the distance 
between the left- hand side end and the patient’s mark will be the measure of the symptom (see 
Appendix 5).   
Irritable Bowel Syndrome - Sympto m Severity Scale (IBS-SSS)  
IBS-SSS is the most frequently used severity meas ure for evaluating IBS severity. Items relate to 
pain, bowel dysfunction and overall well-being. This  is a composite score of abdominal pain, number 
of days with abdominal pain, bloa ting/distension, satisfaction with bowel habits, and IBS-related 
quality of life (QoL). The IBS-SSS questionnaire consists of 5 questions referred ‘‘to the last ten 
days ’’ (see Appendix 6).  
Dermatology Quality of Life Index (10-item DLQI) 
The Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) represen ts a valuable method for measuring the impact 
of skin disease on patients’ lives. The DLQI cons ists of 10 questions concerning symptoms and 
feelings, daily activities, leisure, work, and schoo l, personal relationships and treatment. Each 
question is answered by a tick box: ‘‘not at all’’, ‘‘a little’ ’, ‘‘a lot’’ or ‘‘very much’’. Each question is 
scored from 0 to 3 and the scores summed, giving a range from 0 (no impairment of life quality) to 
30 (maximum impairment). All the questions are referred ‘‘to the last week’’. The DLQI was designed 
to be used in adults over the age of 18 years. Information belonging from DLQI can enhance the 
quality of care provid ed (see Appendix 7). 
 
12.2 Assessment of safety 
Safety will be evaluated by [CONTACT_99845]: 
x Complete Physical Examination including height, weight, BMI;  
x Vital signs (including heart rate, bl ood pressure, and body temperature);

Not assessed.  
 
14. PHARMACOKINETIC ENDPOINTS 
Pharmacokinetic of the new formulation of Rifaximin- EIR (250 mg tablets) has been included in the 
secondary endpoints. In particular , the PK of the two groups receiving repeated doses of Rifaximin-
EIR (250 mg t.i.d. and 500 mg t.i.d., respectively) after the initial administration (Day 1) and at the 
end of treatment (Day 30) will be assessed. 
 
14.1 Pharmacokinetics blood sampling 
Venous blood samples (about 6 mL each) will be collected from the subjects by a trained member of the clinical team. Consent will be collected from the subjects for use of these samples for the purposes of the proposed study. Samples will be processed to isolate plasma and PK analysis will be carried out on plasma samples. 
Plasma samples will be sent for laboratory testing in linked anonymised form (subject number only). 
Venous blood samples (heparin) w ill be withdrawn via an indwellin g cannula or by [CONTACT_99847]. 
For all subject randomized in the three PK sub-gr oups, approximately 22 venous blood samples for 
PK analysis will be collected over the course of the study according to the following scheme: 
x Day 1 (V2): Pre dose and 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6,  [ADDRESS_110034] dosing (first dose in the morning) 
x Day 30 (V3): Pre dose (single dose in the morning) , and at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 22, 
24, [ADDRESS_110035] dosing (blood sampling will continue at Day 31 as appropriate).The exact 
time of PK sampling collection must be recorded in the CRF. 
 The acceptable deviations from the nomina l blood sampling times are as follows: 
x Day 1 only: The pre- dose samples will be taken ≤1 h before dosing ; 
x [ADDRESS_110036]-dose samples will be taken with in ± [ADDRESS_110037]-dose on Day 30 samples will be 
taken within ± [ADDRESS_110038]-dose sampling time;

 15. SAFETY ASPECTS 
15.1 Adverse Events 
15.1.1 Definition of Adverse Events 
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical o ccurrence in a patient or clinical trial patient 
administered a medicinal product whic h does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this 
treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an 
investigational product, whether or not related to the investigational product. 
 
An AE does include any: 
• Exacerbation of pre-existing illness. 
• Increase in frequency or intensity of a pr e-existing epi[INVESTIGATOR_3756]. 
• Condition detected or diagnosed after study dr ug administration even though it may have 
been present prior to the start of the study. 
• Continuous persistent disease or symptoms present at baseline that worsen following the 
start of the study. • Symptoms associated with disease not pr eviously reported by [CONTACT_102]. 
 
An AE does not include a/an: 
x Medical or surgical procedure (e.g., surgery,  endoscopy, tooth extrac tion, transfusion); the 
condition that leads to the procedure is an AE. 
x Planned medical or surgical procedures. 
x Pre-existing diseases or conditions present or detected at the start of the study that do not 
worsen. 
x Situations where an untoward medical occurren ce has not occurred (e.g. hospi[INVESTIGATOR_99809], social and/or convenience admissions). 
x The disease or disorder being studied, or si gn or symptom associated with the disease or 
disorder unless more severe than expected for the patient condition. 
x Overdose of other study drug or concurre nt medication without signs or symptoms. 
x Symptoms associated with the disease that are consistent with the patient usual clinical 
course unless the symptom(s) meet(s) the criteria for “serious” except for what detailed in 
chapter. 15.1.3.  
15.1.2 Definition of Serious Adverse Events 
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any untoward medica l occurrence in a patient or clinical trial patient 
administered a medicinal product whic h does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this 
treatment. A serious adverse event can theref ore be any unfavourable and unintended sign 
(including an abnormal laboratory  finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use 
of an investigational product, whether or not rela ted to the investigational product and results in: 
➢ death; 
➢ is life-threatening; 
➢ requires in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_99810]; 
➢ results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity;

 ➢ is an important medical event that may not be  immediately life-threatening or result in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_99811], but may jeopardise the subject, or may require intervention to 
prevent one of the occurrences listed above; 
➢ is a congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
 
The term life-threatening refers to an event in whic h the patient was at risk of death at the time of 
the event; it does not refer to an event which hypo thetically might have caused death if it had been 
more severe. 
Examples of important medical events which could be reported as serious are intensive treatment in 
an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do 
not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11956]; or developm ent of drug dependen cy or drug abuse. 
An unexpected adverse event is an AE whose nature, severity or outcome is not consistent with 
the information given into the Reference Safety Info rmation (RSI). Reference documents in this study 
is the Investigator's Brochure. 
Expected serious adverse reactions should be considered always unexpected if: 
➢ have an unexpected outcom e (e.g. a fatal outcome); 
➢ have an increase in the rate of occurrence, wh ich is judged to be clinically important. 
Expectedness evaluation is performed by [CONTACT_99848] (RSI).  
15.1.[ADDRESS_110043] ex clusion criteria and acceptance of methods to prevent pregnancy is 
an eligibility criterion, unex pected cases of pregnancy could occur during the study. 
Female patients will be instructed to notify the Investigator in case they become pregnant. 
If a pregnancy occurs during the course of the study, any treatment will be stopped and the 
Investigator shall notify, regardless whether a SAE is present or not, the Sponsor or whoever 
assumes the tasks delegated by [CONTACT_86622] 24 hours of knowing about the event. 
The report shall be made using a specific “In Pregnancy/In Utero Exposure ” form, for the notification 
of pregnancy, which must be sent by [CONTACT_99849]. 
In case of an onset of SAE or an unfavorable outcome occurs (abortion, abnormalities in the fetus, 
early termination of pregnancy) a SAE form also must  be filled-in by [CONTACT_99850]. 
Also, a follow-up of the pregnancy, until the childbirth, will be performed to document its outcome 
and the state of health of the newborn.  
If the pregnancy outcome meets the SAE criteria or if the newborn presents a serious event, the 
procedures for reporting a SAE will be followed.

 15.1.4 Change of Laboratory Parameters 
Whether a change of parameters in the safety laboratory investigations (i.e. haematocrit, liver 
enzymes etc.) is observed and the parameter shifts from normal to a clinically significant abnormal 
value, or a basal abnormal value worsens during tr eatment with the investigational drug respect pre-
treatment value, can also represent an adverse event .  
If the change is clinically significant , when evaluating such changes, variation from the normal range, 
the extent of deviation from normal and time taken to return to normal after discontinuing treatment, 
should be taken into consideration. If there are pathological values at the end of the treatment phase which were not present before, 
further clinical or laboratory investigations must be  performed until the values return to normal or, a 
plausible explanation is found for the pathologic al laboratory value (e.g. concomitant disease). 
The Investigator will decide if a change in laborato ry parameter is clinically relevant and therefore 
represents or not an adverse event (serious/not serious) according to the above criteria and the clinical state of the subject.  
 
15.1.[ADDRESS_110044] assi gn, for each event, the causal relationship  with study treatment 
according to the following categories:  
[0 = Not related / No Reasonable possibility ]: to be used for an AE/SAE which is not suspected to 
be related to the study treatment. 
[1 = Related/Reasonable possibility ] to be used for an AE/SAE which is suspected to be related 
to the study treatment. The definition implies a reasonable possibility of a causal relationship 
between the event and the study treatment. This means that there are facts (evidence) or 
arguments to suggest a causal relationship. 
 
Moreover, Investigators must assign the possible grade of Severity to the observed AEs using 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Event (CTC-AE) V5.0 
(https://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/ele ctronic_applications/d ocs/CTCAE_v5_Quick_Ref
erence_5x7.pdf ), as follows: 
 
• Mild: asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not 
indicated. 
• Moderate : minimal, local or non-invasive interven tion indicated; limiting age-appropriate 
instrumental ADL (Activities of Daily Living). 
• Severe: or medically significant but not immediat ely life-threatening; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8942]; disabling; limiting self-care ADL (Activities of Daily 
Living). 
• Life-threatening consequences: urgent intervention indicated. 
• Death. 
 
Categories “Severe”, “Life -threatening” and “Death” will be considered as seriousness criteria  per 
se. 
 
Outcome : “recovered”,  “recovered with sequelae”, “not yet recovered”, “death”,  “unknown /lost to 
follow up”.

 One “SAE form” should be used for each SAE. However,  if at the time of in itial reporting, multiple  
SAEs are present that are temporally and/or clinical ly related, they may be reported on the same 
“SAE  form” preferably as a diagnosis. 
The SAE form must be completed as thoroughly as possible with all available details of the event, 
signed by [CONTACT_737] (or appropriately qual ified designee), and reported immediately to the 
Sponsor, within [ADDRESS_110049] all information regarding an SAE, he/she will not wait to receive additional information before compi[INVESTIGATOR_99812], although the following minimal information is required: 
¾ Study Protocol number 
¾ Study Centre number 
¾ Patient identification number 
¾ Sex, and age 
¾ Investigational product(s) 
¾ Description of the adverse event 
¾ Causal relationship by [CONTACT_093].  
¾ Name, affiliation, telephone and fax number of the reporting Investigator 
 
The additional information as soon as available will be recorded in a separate SAE form completed 
in every part that will be sent as a follow-up report. 
 
The Investigator will always  provide his/her assessment of causality at the time of the initial report. 
If follow-up obtained subsequently, lead the investigator to change the assessment of causality, the 
SAE form may be appropriately amended, signed and dated, and resubmitted to the Sponsor as 
follow up report. 
If a patient dies during participation in the st udy or during a recognized follow-up period, the 
Investigator should send to the Sponsor, together with SAE Form, any other available post-mortem 
information, including auto psy and histopathology. 
In accordance with local Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) requirements, the Investigator might have to notify to IEC also any SAEs.  
 
15.1.[ADDRESS_110050] ed (S[LOCATION_003]R). Such events are subject to expedited reporting to 
regulatory authorities and they must be reported within the timelines foreseen by [CONTACT_99851] a suitably qualified designee. The Sponsor is responsible for reporting S[LOCATION_003]R to the relevant regulatory authorities in the time frames and methodology applicable a ccording to local Law and Regulations.  
 
15.1.[ADDRESS_110051] study AEs and SAEs 
Serious and non-serious AEs will be recorded, after patient signature [CONTACT_43998], from the 
Screening visit (V1) to the End of study visit (V5) or Early termination visit, regardless of whether the 
participant is on treatment. 
SAEs will be recorded and reported as appropriate an d followed-up until resolution or the patient is 
lost to follow up. Non-serious AEs will be recorded as appropriate and followed-up until End of Study

Patients should be informed that despi[INVESTIGATOR_99813] (less than 1%), like all 
rifamycin derivatives, rifaximin may caus e a reddish discolouration of the urine. 
Clostridium Difficile associated diarrhoea (CDAD) has been  reported with use of nearly all 
antibacterial agents, including rifa ximin. The potential association of rifaximin treatment with CDAD 
and pseudomembranous colitis (PMC) cannot be ruled out.

 Analysis on the PPS will be performed according to the actual treatment received. Patients 
randomized to a wrong stratification factor level will not be excluded from the PPS and will be analysed according to the actual stratum (not the randomized one).

 The co-primary efficacy endpoints, clinically assessed by [CONTACT_737], are the absolute change 
from baseline in number of rosacea inflammatory  lesions (papules and pustules) at the end of 
treatment AND the percent of subjects showing treatment success, defined as an IGA score of 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear) with at least a 2-grade improvement from baseline at the end of treatment. 
The first co-primary efficacy endpoint (i.e.: mean change from Baseline [V2] in number of 
inflammatory lesions at Day 30 [V3]) will be an alysed by [CONTACT_99819] 
(ANCOVA) model, with change from Baseline to Day 30 as dependent variable, treatment group and 
stratification factor as explicative factors, and base line number of inflammatory lesions as covariate. 
The adjusted mean differences will be presented with 95% CIs and p-values. 
The second co-primary efficacy endpoint (i.e.: pe rcent of patients showing treatment success) will 
be analysed by [CONTACT_3553] a stratified Cochran Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) chi square test. The Breslow-
Day test for stratified tables will be applied. A two-sided 95% CI for difference in success rate 
between the treatment groups (each active gr oup vs placebo) will also be computed.

 The change from baseline to the relevant visit in secondary endpoints 1 and from 4 to 9 will be 
analyzed by [CONTACT_99854] (ANCOVA) Model, with change from Baseline to 
the relevant visit for the current endpoint as depe ndent variable, treatment group and stratification 
factor  as explicative factors and baseline value of  the current endpoint as covariate. The adjusted 
mean differences will be presented with 95% CIs and p-values. 
The secondary endpoints expressed as percentages (end points 2, 3, 10 and 11) will be analyzed by 
[CONTACT_3553] a two-sided Cochran Mantel-Haenszel Chi- square test stratified by L-BT status. The 
Breslow-Day test for stratified tables will be applied. A two-sided 95% CI for difference of success 
rate between the treatment groups (each active group vs placebo) will also be computed. 
Considering the explorative nature of the secondary endpoints, all the inferential results obtained on 
them will be descriptively interpreted.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Pharmacokinetics Methods and Statistical Data Analysis  
Individual plasma concentrations and collection times will be listed by [CONTACT_99855]-completion. 
Summaries of concentration data will include mean, standard deviation and coefficient of variation by [CONTACT_99856], by [CONTACT_2715]. Mean concentration –time profiles will be 
presented graphically, with concentration shown on linear and logarithmic scales. 
Pharmacokinetic parameters will be calculated for all subjects who belong to the pharmacokinetic 
population (see paragraph 16.2.5), using standard non-compartmental methods as described in 
paragraph 14.2. 
No value of derived parameters such as Lambda-z, t
1/2, AUC 0-∞ will be reported for cases that do not 
exhibit a terminal log-linear phase in the concentr ation versus time profile. All times used in the 
calculation of pharmacokinetic parameters will be the actual  elapsed time from treatment 
administration, with the exception of pre-dose da ta which will be given the nominal time of 0.00 
hours. Determination of PK parameters will be performed using appropriate software.  
Pharmacokinetics parameters will be summarised by [CONTACT_99857], study 
groups, gender and overall. 
16.3.3 Safety Laboratory Statistical Analysis 
All safety measures will be descr iptively summarized by [CONTACT_22058] t group in the SAF population.  
Where appropriate, the reported laboratory values  and the corresponding reference ranges will be 
converted into SI units. 
For laboratory data and vital signs, the numeric values and corresponding changes from baseline 
will be summarized using descriptive statistics (number of subjects, mean, standard deviation, 
minimum, median, maximum) by [CONTACT_99858].  
In addition, laboratory values will be classified as normal/high/low based on the reference range. 
Abnormal values will also be classified as clinical ly significant (CS) abnormalities and non-clinically 
significant (non-CS) abnormalities. This classification will be summarized by [CONTACT_99859]-baseline assessments.

 All adverse events will be assigned to a Preferre d Term (PT) and will be classified by [CONTACT_99860].  
Any adverse event which started at or after the first administration of study treatment will be 
considered as Treatment Emergent Adverse Event (TEAE). If the start date is missing for an AE, 
the AE will be considered to be treatment emergent.  
Adverse events will be re ported on a per-patient ba sis. This means that even if a patient reported 
the same event repeatedly, the event will be counted only once.  
TEAEs relationship to study me dications will be investigated with frequency tables. Missing 
classifications concerning study drug relationship  will also be considered as treatment-related.  
The following tables will be presented:  
1. Overview of AEs and TEAEs showing the nu mber of AEs and TEAEs and the number of 
patients with any AEs and TEAEs, treatment-related TEAEs, serious TEAEs, treatment-related serious TEAEs and TEAEs leading to study withdrawal;

 Summary statistics will generally be reported based upon observed data. Should a determination of 
treatment period (on treatment, pre-treatment) be required fo r adverse events or Lactulose 
medication but the corresponding date is missing, or  is a partial date, the event/medication will be 
considered on treatment unless the portions of the date that are available indicate this is not possible. With reference to the statistical analyses performe d on the FAS, the last observation carried forward 
(LOCF) strategy will be employed for dealing wi th any missing continuous data for the relevant 
primary and secondary endpoints. For categorical data (i.e. Success/Failure) missing data will be considered as Failures, unless di fferently specified in the SAP.  
With reference to other categorical variables, th e number of patients wit h missing data will be 
presented under the “unknown” category. Missing valu es will be included in the denominator count 
when computing percentages, unless  otherwise specified in the SAP. 
When other continuous data will be summarized, only the non-missing values will be evaluated for 
computing summary statistics.  
Missing data in safety variables will not be replaced. 
 
16.4 Additionally Planned Statistical Analyses 
16.4.1 Interim Analyses and Data Monitoring Committee 
No interim analysis or assignment of a data monitoring committee is planned. 
16.4.2 Multicentre study Considering that the number of subjects per center will be low, the center will not be considered as 
an explicative factor in the statistical analyses. 
16.4.3 Examination of Subgroups There are no pre-defined sub-groups in this study.  However, there is one sub-study on PK data.

17.7 Subjects' Records 
If subjects’  files are in electronic format, the system used must be compliant with the minimum 
requirements of the “Computerised system used in clinical trials” regulation.  
If the above-mentioned minimum requirements are not fulfilled, the Investigator must print-out, sign 
and date the patient’s data that will become the source documents The Investigator must assure in writing that the data on the print-outs are identi cal to the electronic data and are complete. These 
print-out must to be archived in the Investigator’s Study File. No e-CRF print-out will serve as source 
documentation.
 
All data collected from screened subjects will be verified against the source documents.  
This will include all entries in subjects’  e-CRF and all laboratory data. Data documented in the e-
CRF at the baseline visit, during treatment and in th e follow-up period will be verifiable through the 
original source documents (i.e. pati ent’s notes, laboratory records).  
It is the Investigator’s responsibility to ensure all relevant data are entered in the  patient’s medical 
file, for example medical history/concomitant diseases , date of study enrolmen t, visit dates, results 
of examinations and AEs.  
The Investigator(s)/Institution(s) will permit study-related monitoring, audits, IRB/IEC reviews, and 
regulatory inspections, and provide dire ct access to source data/documents.  
17.8 Case Report Forms 
An electronic CRF (e-CRF) is used to record clinical trial data and is an integral part of the trial and 
subsequent reports. They must refl ect patient’s status at each phase during the course of the trial.  
All information requested on the eCRF should be ente red. If one is not available or is not applicable, 
this must be indicated. 
The Investigator must ensure the accuracy, the completeness and the consistency of the data 
entered in the e-CRF. A User Manual with detailed in structions about e-CRF filling in will be provided 
to each Investigator and a specific training will be performed. 
Subjects must not to be identified on the e-CRF by [CONTACT_2300], but by [CONTACT_1130]’s  identification number. The 
e-CRF is specifically designed to record the data required by [CONTACT_3181]. They must be kept up-to-
date so that they always reflect the latest observat ions on the subjects enrolled in the study; the e-
CRF should be filled in immediately after the conclusion of each subject’s  visit, preferably within 24 
hours but no later than five working days after the visit.

Clinical data will be captured using a study specific eCRF using a validated and Code of Federal 
Regulations (CFR) Part 11 compliant Electronic Data Capture (EDC) system. Sites will receive training and have access to the study specific eCRF completion guidelines.
 
All eCRFs should be completed by [CONTACT_99878] d site staff and reviewed, electronically signed 
and dated by [CONTACT_737]. 
Pre-defined data validation checks will be run within the eCRF as the data are entered and submitted 
by [CONTACT_99879].  The resulting data queries will be reviewed by [CONTACT_99880].   An electronic audit trail of all changes made to the eCRF will be kept within the EDC system. This 
audit trail identified the user making the change and date and time of change. 
At the end of the study, each site will receive their subject’s data in an electronic readable format 
(i.e., PDF format) burned on an adequate media (e.g., CD or DVD). The site will receive a PDF file 
for each enrolled subject; the file will contain the patient’s data and its audit trail. Data files will be 
archived with the site study records

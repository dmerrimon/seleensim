PROJECT NARRATIVE 1) Background This project aims to reduce negative health outcomes in small businesses that primarily employ high-risk Latino workers by [CONTACT_912547] a community health worker (CHW) intervention is effective at decreasing these exposures. Occupational disease and injury, though preventable by [CONTACT_108], are leading causes of death in the 
    
   Page 5 of 16  HSPP Use Only: Form 200 v 2016-07  [LOCATION_002], with a disproportionate burden faced by [CONTACT_652167]. Small businesses pose a particular risk. They are more likely to employ low-wage Latino workers, and often use hazardous solvents containing volatile organic chemicals that can cause asthma, cancer, cardiovascular, and neurological disease; yet their workers lack access to culturally and linguistically appropriate occupational health and pollution prevention information due to economic, physical, and social barriers. CHW-led interventions and outreach in Latino communities have documented increased access to health care and health education and reduced workplace exposures among farmworkers. CHWs are an innovative method to bridge the gap between these small business communities and other stakeholders. The proposed project will capi[INVESTIGATOR_912541], the Sonora Environmental Research Institute, Inc. and the El Rio Community Health Center. A community-engaged research framework will be used to complete three specific aims: 1) Quantify and identify exposures to hazardous chemicals in the two high risk small business sectors common in our target area (i.e., auto repair shops and beauty salons); 2) Work collaboratively with business owners, trade groups, workers and CHWs to design an industrial hygiene-enhanced CHW intervention tailored for each small business sector; and 3) Conduct a cluster randomized trial to evaluate the effectiveness of the CHW intervention at reducing workplace exposures to volatile organic compounds and assess which factors led to successful utilization of exposure control strategies in both male and female-dominated businesses. Businesses will be randomized to either an intervention or delayed intervention group, both of which will receive incentives to participate, such as worksite health screenings. CHWs will work closely with business owners and employees to select and implement exposure-strategies appropriate for their worksite using a menu of complementary strategies of varying complexity and cost. This innovative project has the potential to directly reduce occupational health disparities through a CHW intervention that moves beyond providing occupational health education. The intervention will overcome current barriers by [CONTACT_4205][INVESTIGATOR_912542], literacy, and computer skills to understand the hazards associated with their work, and will empower them to have greater control over their occupational exposures, with the ultimate goal of preventing occupational disease and reducing health disparities. 2) Purpose Project Goal: Determine if an industrial hygiene-enhanced community health worker (CHW) intervention can significantly reduce workplace exposures to hazardous chemicals in small businesses that mainly employ marginalized minority workers.  3) Lay Summary (approximately 400 words) Occupational exposures contribute to minority health disparities. This study will formally evaluate if a community health worker intervention can effectively reduce workplace exposures to hazardous chemicals in marginalized small businesses. Through face-to-face encounters, this study will increase the capacity of workers with limited education, literacy, and computer skills to understand workplace hazards and implement effective control options to reduce exposures and prevent occupational disease. For Aim 1, we will characterize exposure to volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in 20 local businesses (10 from each sector). We will measure this through two methods: 1) Summa Canisters, which are metal canisters to collect air that is analyzed for VOCs, will be placed in the workplace and will give an average air concentration over time, and 2) A small device, a photo-ionizing detector (PID) called 
    
   Page 6 of 16  HSPP Use Only: Form 200 v 2016-07  a ppbRAE3000, which records VOCs exposure levels in real-time, will be worn by [CONTACT_912548]/managers who agree to participate. We will facilitate focus groups with workers (x4) and brief interviews with owner/managers (1/shop) to explore elements of the safety culture such as risk perception and attitudes towards health promotion and personal protection. In Aim 2, we will work with various business owners, trade groups, workers and CHWs to design and refine approaches that CHWs can take to reduce workplace VOCs exposures, specific for each business sector. In Aim 3, we will recruit participants from 120 businesses (60 from each sector) and evaluate how effective the CHW intervention is at reducing workplace exposures to VOCs by [CONTACT_912549]. To help the CHWs determine the best recommendations for each shop, they will ask owners a series of questions and complete a shop audit. In addition, we will also ask questions of owners and employees about their ideas on health and wellness in the workplace and how they felt about the CHW recommendations in their shops. We will also conduct focus groups with ownersto investigate their ideas on the CHW recommendations.  4) Setting of the Human Research Research will take place in underserved communities in Tucson, AZ in small businesses (<25 employees) that primarily employ high-risk Latino workers. We will focus on beauty salons and auto repair shops. For measuring chemicals in air for Aim 1, we will work with a total of 10 of each business type drawn from seven zip code areas in Tucson (total of 20 businesses). For the interviews with owners and focus groups with workers as part of Aim 1, we will recruit owners and workers from these same [ADDRESS_1282163] but from 120 shops total (60 from each sector) from the same seven zip codes in Tucson. If it is not possible to recruit all the shops we need, we will amend this geographic recruitment area in the future. Surveys on health and wellness and the CHW recommendations for reducing exposures will be done at the workplace. Any questions asked to refine the exposure control recommendations will take place at work. Focus groups will be held in a non-business related, neutral location in the general area. Potential businesses will have the project fully explained to them. If a business agrees to participate and the owner signs the site authorization form, we will describe the project to employees and provide them with individual Informed Consent Forms. The project will capi[INVESTIGATOR_912541], the Sonora Environmental Research Institute, Inc. and the El Rio Community Health Center. Our hope is that a CHW intervention will be shown to be effective at decreasing VOC exposures in these small business types.  5) Resources available to conduct the Human Research  Key personnel include: Paloma I. Beamer, Ph.D. Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Beamer is an Associate Professor of Environmental Health Sciences in the Mel and Enid Zuckerman College of Public Health and Chemical & Environmental Engineering at the University of Arizona. 
    
   Page 7 of 16  HSPP Use Only: Form [ADDRESS_1282164]. Billheimer is a Professor in the Department of Epi[INVESTIGATOR_912543]. Maia Ingram, MPH. Co-Investigator [CONTACT_912559] is Program Director for Community-Based Evaluation Projects in the Health Promotion Sciences Department of the Mel and Enid Zuckerman College of Public Health at the University of Arizona. Community collaborators include: Sonora Environmental Research Institute, Inc. (SERI):  SERI will lead the community health worker intervention. They will be responsible for recruitment of businesses, aid in development of the intervention, serve as a liaison and implement the intervention by [CONTACT_912550]. They will also assist in training, workshops, and results interpretation and dissemination. El Rio Community Health Center: El Rio will conduct interviews with owner/managers and focus groups with workers in Aim 1. El Rio will be responsible for conducting health screenings, wellness consultations, and follow-up health care referrals (during Aim 3). They will also aid in development of the intervention and dissemination of the results in the community.  6) Study Population We anticipate that we will obtain personal exposure measurements from up to 4 workers at 140 businesses (Aim 1 n=20; Aim 3 n=120), as well as conduct focus groups with owners/managers at each business (n=140). Thus, we anticipate that our total subject population could be 700 small business workers and owners. It is possible that at some businesses with <[ADDRESS_1282165] assumed 3 workers per business (n=420) in calculation of our planned enrollment, in addition to the 140 business owners. We will make every attempt to measure the exposure of the same workers at each assessment. However, because of timing constraints, high worker turnover or staffing changes in the businesses, it is possible that different workers could be measured at each assessment, resulting in a possible total of 1520 (20 business*4 workers+120 businesses*4 workers*3 assessments) worker subjects, in addition to the 140 business owner participants.     
    
   Page 8 of 16  HSPP Use Only: Form 200 v 2016-07  Inclusion criteria include workers or owner/managers of small businesses over 18 years of age in the auto repair or beauty salon sectors in southern metropolitan Tucson, Arizona. Exclusion criteria include age less than 18 years or people not working in auto repair or beauty salon sectors.  7) Recruitment Methods and Consenting Process a. Recruitment Process:  Businesses will be recruited with the assistance of SERI CHWs and the Tucson Hispanic Chamber of Commerce. The project will be described to the business owner/manager and if they agree to participate and sign the site authorization form, workers will be told about the project’s overall goals of community health interventions leading to decreased exposure to potentially dangerous chemicals in their workplace. In Aim 1, we are recruiting 20 businesses so that we can obtain an idea of current baseline VOC exposure levels and work practices, as well as owner/manager and worker ideas about health and safety in the workplace via interviews and focus groups. These are small businesses and SERI CHWs typi[INVESTIGATOR_912544]-to-door and explain the project orally. In Aim 3, we will recruit 120 businesses using the same methods as developed in Aim 1. In Aim 3, once the business owner/manager agrees for their business to participate and signs the site authorization, the owner/manager will be recruited into the study, allowing the study team to get information about their shop and work practices critical for choosing effective ways of reducing chemical exposures (see Owner_Consent document).  Once the business owner/manager is recruited, individual employees and the owner/manager (if they do similar activities as workers) will be recruited with the goal of measuring four full-shift exposures per business (see AirSampling_Consent document). In Aim 3, we will complete four full-shift exposures in three different visit periods for a total of [ADDRESS_1282166] four workers that are willing to participate, multiple measurements may be taken on the same workers on multiple days. Employees and owner/managers will also be recruited to join focus groups and do interviews, respectively. However, since the shops participating in Aim 1 are not able to participate in the randomized control trial in Aim 3 (for statistical reasons), we will only work with businesses with enough potential participants to consent to complete monitoring for 4 work shifts for any part of Aim 1. In Aim 3, after we recruit air sampling participants, we will also recruit owners/managers and employees to complete a survey on health and wellness in the workplace (see WellnessSurvey_Consent document). Owner/managers will be recruited for focus groups discussing ideas about CHW recommendations on reducing workplace VOC exposures (see FocusGroup_Consent document). We will recruit employees to complete a survey on ideas about CHW recommendations on reducing VOC exposures (see PostInterventionQx_Consent document).   b. Informed Consent:  Once the business owner agrees to participate, they will be provided with a site authorization letter to sign. SERI CHWs will describe in the language of choice (English or Spanish) the study in general and the small VOC measurement device the participants will be asked to wear. They will also describe the survey on health and wellness in the workplace (see WellnessSurvey_Consent document) to owner/managers and employees; the focus groups (see FocusGroup_Consent 
    
   Page 9 of 16  HSPP Use Only: Form 200 v 2016-07  document) to owners/managers; the survey on ideas about CHW recommendations on reducing VOC exposures (see PostInterventionQx_Consent document) to employees.  The Informed Consent Form (ICF) document for each study component (e.g. Air Sampling; Wellness Survey; Focus Group, etc.), in the language of subject’s choice – Spanish or English, will then be read aloud to potential subjects (ensuring low-literacy participants have the same access to information and chance to ask questions). If an employee or owner/manager agrees to participate, they will be given a written ICF document and have the chance to ask questions. The ICF may be taken home to discuss with family members if they wish. Please note that immigration status will not be asked, discussed, or recorded at any point in this project.   8) Research procedures involved in the Human Research During Aim 3, owner/managers will answer questions about their workplace and practices and complete a survey on ideas about CHW recommendations on reducing exposures (see Owner_Consent document). Owner/managers and employees will have the option to consent into any of the following: wearing an air sampler during their work shift (see AirSampling_Consent document); and/or a survey on health and wellness in the workplace (see WellnessSurvey_Consent document). Owner/managers also have the option to consent to a focus group on ideas about the CHW recommendations on reducing VOC exposures (see FocusGroup_Consent document). Employees will also have the option to consent to answering questions in survey format on ideas about CHW recommendations on reducing VOC exposures (see PostInterventionQx_Consent document). For the business owner/manager completing the Owner_Consent document, they will be asked questions on: their background and demographics; their workplace and practices so as to help inform the VOC control recommendations; and their ideas about the CHW recommendations on reducing VOC exposures that were recommended in their shop.  For the owner/manager or employee completing the AirSampling_Consent document, they will be asked questions on their background and demographics. Participants of air monitoring will wear a small device called a photo-ionization detector (PID) attached to their clothing during the work shift. The PID can only obtain total VOC exposure levels, and it is not possible to distinguish exposures to individual VOCs if multiple VOCs are present. The PI[INVESTIGATOR_912545] 60 seconds. Please see device information included with this submission for more information on the PID. Results of the sampling will be returned to participants individually by a CHW, and then they will be asked a brief survey on how it went to get their results returned to them. For the owner/manager or employee completing the WellnessSurvey_Consent document, they will be asked questions on their background and demographics and on health and wellness in the workplace. This will take place at the health screening visit. For the owner/manager completing the FocusGroup_Consent document, they will be asked questions on their background and demographics and ideas about the CHW recommendations on reducing VOC exposures in their business. This focus group will be held outside of work hours at a non-work location. Conversations during focus groups and interviews will be audio recorded and notes will be taken on the dialogue. 
    
   Page 10 of 16  HSPP Use Only: Form [ADDRESS_1282167] every 1-2 months throughout the study in the preferred language of the owner/manager. These postcards will address what is a VOC; a thank you for signing up for the study; and then series of reminders about focus groups for owner/managers.   9) Cost to subjects  There will be no direct cost to subjects. The air monitoring portion in this study will not take any extra time, since the participant will only participate during their regular work shift. It may take a few minutes to put the equipment on (this was approved as part of Aim 1 and has not changed for Aim 3). These pi[INVESTIGATOR_912546]. The wellness surveys, focus groups, and post-intervention questionnaire portions will take up approximately 10 minutes, 1.5 hours, and 10 minutes of each participant’s time, respectively. This includes travel to an off-site location for a focus group.  Questions for the owner/manager that will help inform how to better reduce VOCs will take approximately 1 hour of the participant’s time.  For owner/managers who participate in both wellness surveys, a focus group, and questions about the shop come up with more appropriate methods of reducing VOC exposures in the shop, it will take a total [ADDRESS_1282168]-intervention questionnaire, and it will take a total of 30 minutes.   10) Risks to subjects There is no known risk involved with wearing the PID. If the subject finds its presence annoying or uncomfortable in any way, they may simply take it off. There are no anticipated risks to subjects from participating other than the risks they encounter daily completing their normal job tasks.  There is no known risk involved with participating in focus groups or any surveys/questionnaires. Potential subjects may refuse to be enrolled in the research study even if the small business owner/manager that employs them has agreed to participate by [CONTACT_912551]. This will be explained to both owners/managers and employees at the onset. Within the worksite, workers will know which of the other workers are participating in the study because they will be wearing the monitors and the monitors will be visible. Owner/managers will not know if their workers participate in focus groups as these will be held off-site outside of work hours (Aim 1). 
    
   Page 11 of 16  HSPP Use Only: Form 200 v 2016-07  It is possible that participants may be concerned about participating in our study because of their legal immigration status or concern about compliance with occupational regulations.  Business owners may be concerned about letting their workers participate because of economic risks, potential liability, or possible reputational harm.  Study staff may also be exposed to VOCs while collecting data in the small businesses. Our team has substantial experience conducting studies with Latino populations of mixed immigration status, and with utilizing protocols that effectively minimize risks while working with these populations. This includes: 1) not asking about immigration status; 2) obtaining a Certificate of Confidentiality from NIH; 3) orally reading Informed Consent Forms to participants in their preferred language; and 4) minimizing collection of identifiable and private data as much as possible. Further, to protect any potential economic risk or harm to the businesses, we will maintain confidentiality of the participating business and will not link exposure data with a business in any public setting.  11) Potential benefits to subjects and/or society Potential direct benefits to the subjects include knowledge of their personal VOC exposures and reduced exposures to hazardous chemicals in the workplace. As VOCs emitted from small businesses are one of the primary sources of hazardous air pollutants in urban air, particularly in minority neighborhoods, by [CONTACT_912552], we may also reduce neighborhood exposures to these chemicals. This could benefit workers and their families if they live nearby. In our previous work, we have demonstrated that regions of metropolitan Tucson that have the highest levels of hazardous air pollution and emissions from small businesses have higher than expected cases of childhood wheezing illnesses.  12) Provisions to protect the privacy of subjects and the confidentiality of data a. Protection of subject privacy: There will be no personal identifiers (including business name) on any written materials used for exposure assessments, surveys, questionnaires, or other data collection instruments. Businesses will receive an alphanumeric code. During focus groups, participants will be asked to NOT use their names when speaking. We will not discuss or inquire about immigration status at any point during the study. Consent forms and the link between personal identifiers and subject codes will be kept separately from all other study material, in hardcopy form only, within a locked cabinet in Drachman Hall, room A223 at the University of Arizona. All contact [CONTACT_912553]. In order to facilitate scheduling of previously consented individuals for air sampling between the three organizations, we will store the link between the participant/business alphanumeric code and identifying information temporarily on UA Box Health, a HIPAA-compliant data storage system, until all visits for the business and its participants are completed (estimated 9 months).  b. Protection of data confidentiality: The primary protection against potential risks is a data security plan that includes physical, administrative, and technical aspects for confidentiality and privacy of the data, including personal identifiers. Of particular importance will be the appropriate training of CHWs, interviewers, and program evaluators in maintaining confidentiality and privacy of all data, in addition to their formal training from Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative (CITI). To assure total anonymity of businesses and subjects, alphanumeric codes will be used. Digitized data will be de-identified and stored in a HIPAA-
    
   Page 12 of 16  HSPP Use Only: Form 200 v 2016-07  grade encrypted file storage system (e.g., REDCap). This will include audio recordings of interviews and focus groups, which will be uploaded directly in REDCap. During focus groups, we will ask subjects NOT to use their names. Transcribing of any sort will be completed in a sound-proof room (Medical Research Building, room 113i), with any transcriptions or audio files being uploaded directly into REDCap. Only study personnel as indicated on the VOTF will have access to this information, including audio recordings and transcriptions. Participants are free to withdraw from the study at any time with no penalties. This right will be explained to each participant as part of the informed consent procedure.   These protections should provide confidentiality to the businesses and reduce the risk of economic harm. Ultimately, we anticipate that businesses will participate because they value the health and wellbeing of their workers and would like to reduce their occupational exposures and help them improve their health. Other businesses are likely to self-select out and are not likely to agree to participate in the study.   13) Access to Private Information  c. Access to medical records (HIPAA): N/A – medical records will not be accessed d. Access to educational records (FERPA): N/A – educational records will not be accessed     e. Access to employee records: N/A – employee records will not be accessed  14) Subject compensation Subjects in the air monitoring portion of Aim 1 will not be compensated for participation. Subjects in the focus groups portion and interviews of Aim 1 will be paid $25 cash for their participation.  In Aim 3, owner/managers participating in air sampling will be paid $10/shift, up to 3 shifts (a total of $30); owner/managers participating in focus groups will be paid $15. An owner/manager could be compensated up to $45 over the course of the study. Employees participating in air sampling will be $10/shift up to 5 shifts (a total of $50). An employee can be compensated up to $50 over the course of the study.   15) Medical care and compensation for injury  No risk of injury is anticipated due to study participation. However, in case of an injury, we do not have any monetary compensation to cover any possible costs related to the injury. Workers will be provided with referral to appropriate community health clinics for follow up if they are concerned about their exposures or any related findings.  16) Monitoring for subject safety  This research does not involve more than minimal risk to subjects. However, because our CHW intervention meets the NIH definition of a clinical trial, we have developed a Data and Safety Monitoring Plan. Data will be monitored by [CONTACT_912554], who have substantial experience in human exposure studies. Each data collector will complete a daily log 
    
   Page 13 of 16  HSPP Use Only: Form [ADDRESS_1282169] agreed to provide oversight on data and safety monitoring for this study:  • Jeff Burgess, MD, MS, MPH; Associate Dean of Research, Mel and Enid Zuckerman College of Public Health; Professor, Environmental Health Sciences, Mel and Enid Zuckerman College of Public Health • Walter Klimecki, DVM, PhD; Interim Department Head and Associate Professor, Pharmacology & Toxicology, College of Pharmacy  • Philip Harber, MD, MPH; Professor, Environmental Health Sciences, Mel and Enid Zuckerman College of Public Health   In addition to these protections, project investigators will establish a set of exposure criteria that will be provided to research staff to determine if a workplace presents immediate, severe risk to workers and themselves. Research staff will be trained to call project investigators immediately, and together they will work with the business owners to resolve the issues with the appropriate regulatory and health agencies.   17) Withdrawal of subjects Subjects may withdraw themselves from the study at any time they wish. Any data collected about chemicals in the air or the subject’s views on safety and health in the workplace from focus groups or interviews to that point may be used in this study. The voluntary nature of their participation will be made clear during the consenting process. Subjects would be withdrawn from the study if it were deemed by [CONTACT_912555]’s best interest to withdraw.  18) Sharing of results with subjects  Air monitoring participants will be provided with the results of their exposure assessments and an interpretation of these exposures with respect to activities at the business, as well as any relevant recommendations on how to reduce their exposures. Participants will be referred to appropriate community health clinics for follow up if they are concerned about their exposures.  Owner/managers will be provided the same results materials as given to all air monitoring participants. In doing so, we realize that owner/managers may be able to identify which results correspond to which worker; however, this will be a condition that air monitoring participants will agree to during consenting. These results will be provided by [CONTACT_912556], so subjects can ask questions. CHWs will be provided with a list of experts, including the PI [INVESTIGATOR_6254]-investigators, who will be able to provide on-site technical advice to businesses seeking assistance with designing and implementing their control

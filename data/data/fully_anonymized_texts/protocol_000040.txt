1 Introduction  
This document is a protocol for a human research study. This study is to be conducted according to U.S. and 
international standards of Good Clinical Practice (FDA Title 21 part 312 and International Conference on Harmonization guidelines), applicable government regulations and Institutional research policies and procedures.  
1.1 Background  
We p ropose a clinical trial evaluating a novel therapy for Kawasaki Disease (Syndrome).  We intend to use the 
data obtained in this study to apply for an Orphan Product Designation for Etanercept (brand name [CONTACT_30972]). Kawasaki is classified as an autoimmune dis ease and di sseminated vasculitis.  It is characterized by [CONTACT_411], 
bilateral, nonexudative conjunctivitis, erythema of the lips and oral mucosa, changes in the extremities, rash, and cervical lymphadenopathy. Coronary artery aneurysms or ectasia develop and may lead to myocardial infarction (MI), sudden death, or ischemic heart disease. This disease is more prevalent in Japan and in children of Japanese ancestry with an annual incidence of 112 cases per 100 000 children < [ADDRESS_30239] frequent cause of acquired heart disease in children.  
A combination of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_30859] (IVIG) is the current standard regimen for 
treatment of acute KD
3. Although aspi[INVESTIGATOR_30860] -inflammatory activity at high d oses and antiplatelet 
activity at low doses, it does not alter the risk for coronary artery disease.  Intravenous gamma globulin now represents the standard for treatment.  IVIG is not a specific therapy and the mechanism of action in KD still requires clarification.  Recent data support a hypothesis, that IVIG modulates immune response in KD through FcGamma receptors on inflammatory cells 
4-7.  Some studies suggest that immune modulation by [CONTACT_30928].  This hypothesis is currently under investigation in o ur own laboratory using a large cohort of patient DNA collected in a multi -center consortium.  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_30861], there has been no major shift in the 
treatment paradigm for acute Kawasaki Disease since the introduction and refinement of immune gamma globulin therapy in the 1980s 
8; and 1990s9.  The vast majo rity of the research in this area focuses on 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_623], identification of risk factors for coronary artery involvement, genetic susceptibility, refinement of current therapy such as the addition of corticosteroids, and the identification and treatment of long term sequela 
10. Recent studies report the incidence of persistent coronary artery involvement in the 15- 20% range 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_30862] 30% in non -responders to IVIG. [ADDRESS_30240] of coronary artery lesions attained in childhood may be immense.  Recent reports from Japan 
indicate that the mortality rate in males with coronary artery lesions is more than twice expected.10.   Therefore, 
the primary goals of therapy should be directed at reducing coronary artery dilation in addition to treating active 
inflammation.  
 
Efficacy of current treatment : The joint statemen t of the American Heart Association and the American 
Academy of Pediatrics states emphatically that “the efficacy of IVIG administered in the acute phase of Kawasaki disease in reducing the prevalence of coronary artery abnormalities is well established.” 
[ADDRESS_30241] 
major controlled randomized trials in KD patients in the [LOCATION_002] (1986) showed superior prevention of coronary artery disease in children with acute KD by [CONTACT_30929]
8.  Subsequently, 
Newburger et al showed that a single high dose of IVIG (2g/kg) administered over 10 hours reduced the

prevalence of coronary abnormalities compared to daily inf usions of 400 mg per kilogram for four consecutive 
days.  Both groups also received ASA (100 mg per kilogram per day) for 14 days 12.  Accordingly, AHA/AAP 
guidelines recommend IVIG 2g/kg in a single dose with some modifications in ASA dosing.  In Japan, where 
prevalence of KD is substantially higher than in the U.S., IVIG is usually given two separate 1g/kg doses on 
consecu tive days 13. 
Although the historical studies show that IVIG prevents coronary artery dilation 8, 12, the failure rate of 
this nonspecific treatment for KD remains high14. It is difficult to determine current IVIG efficacy, as criteria 
and technological advances have altered for reporting coronary artery disease (CAD), and we could not 
ethically perform a randomized placebo trial excluding affected patients from  receiving IVIG.  Discrepancies 
exist between rates of IVIG failure reported from Japan and the [LOCATION_002]  13, 14. These differences are 
partially due to methodology in defining coronary artery dilation.  The discrepancies create challenges in interpretation and performing comparisons of clinical trials, as well as evaluation of new adjunctive therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. For instance, Inoue et al reported that only 3.4% of patients had CAD by [ADDRESS_30242] recent U.S. multicenter trial reported 18.9% CAD in all patients at 6 
weeks, and 9% for patients without CAD at baseline14.

 In figure 1, we show the incidence of coronary artery disease reported for three major multi -center 
clinical trials performed in the [LOCATION_002] over a twenty year period.  This figure clearly shows an increase in 
the reported rate of CAD in KD patients undergoing these trials between [ADDRESS_30243] paragraph of the 2004 AHA/AAP consensus statement, Newburger et al states: “coronary artery aneurysms or ectasia develop in ~15% to 25% of untreated children with the disease.”

18.9% of patients with CAD after standard IVIG treatment  14.  This rate for persistent CAD at 6 weeks falls 
within the range quoted in the 2004 consensus document for CAD in untreated patients.  The recent PHN data 
show that 30% of all KD patients have CAD involvement by 1 week, and 9% of patients without abnormalities at baseline still develop CAD despi[INVESTIGATOR_30863].   Additionally, a recent retrospective review 
indicates that a high rate of pers istent coronary artery dilation or aneurysms occurs in infants > 1 year of age

Disappearance of fever within 48 hours generally heralds a successful response to therapy.  However, 
Burns et al reported that 13% of 378 patients remained febrile after 48 hours 16.  From our institution Wallace et 
al reported 23% of patients either did not respond i nitially or had fever recurrence within [ADDRESS_30244] that the refractory rate may be somewhat higher (see section C). The published 
reports emphasize doubling in the relative risk of coronary artery disease in patients with initial IVIG  treatment 
failure.  Recent studies by [CONTACT_30930] 
17.   However, the published multi -center study did not directly evaluate rate of CAD 
in patients, refractory to initial IVIG.  Extrapolating from prior data relating two -fold increased risk in patients 
not receiving IVIG 8suggests that CAD may occur in up to 35% in these patients at [ADDRESS_30245] the following attributes:

1) therapy is specific and directed at blocking an established inflammatory pathway, known to be activated in KD  
2) treatment is prolonged extending at least 2 weeks after initial IVIG treatment and through the entire phase of acute KD and into the convale scent phase  
3) therapy can be validated by [CONTACT_30931] -state drug levels throughout the treatment

Tumor necrosis factor- α (TNF -α) in KD  
Features of  Kawasaki Disease including vascular inflammation, high fever and marked elevation of the acute 
phase protein, CRP, implicate cytokines as key role players in the pathogenesis. Several cytokines are elevated 
in the acute phase of KD including TNF -α, interl eukin- 1 and interleukin- 620-24.   However, TNF -α has received 
particular attention for several reasons.  TNF -α activation of macrophages includes enhanced production and 
release of TNF -α receptor25.  Patients with KD demo nstrate marked elevation in serum soluble TNF -α receptor 
with even higher levels in patients with coronary artery ectasia, despi[INVESTIGATOR_30864] 26.   Immunochemistry 
studies show that CD14 peripheral blood monocytes/macrophages duri ng acute KD strongly expressed TNF -α 
in their cytoplasm27. Expression of TNF -α weakens in the convalescent phase, suggesting that some of the 
intracytoplasmic granules in these monocytes/ macrophages are secretory granules, which secrete TNF -α27.  
TNF -α promotes migration of P -selectin and production of E -selectin promoting conformational changes in 
endothelium, which may promote vascular dilatation and coronary aneurysm noted in KD 28.    
 The hypothesis that TNF α promotes coronary artery infl ammation is supported by [CONTACT_30932] a well 
established mouse model of KD, created through intraperitoneal injection of L. Casei wall extract.  These mice 
develop coronary artery inflammation, ectasia, and aneurysms, which histopathologically resemble  coronary 
artery lesions seen in postmortem studies from children with KD.  Coronary artery inflammation and vessel 
wall damage are absent in wild -type mice treated with the TNF -α receptor blocker, Etanercept (8 mg/kg twice 
weekly times four weeks, intraperitoneal), and in TNFRI -deficient (TNFRI
-/-) mice 20. Coronary artery 
inflammation and ectasia does occur in mice deficient for TNFRII, which does not bind TNF -α in mice. 
Therefore, TNF -α plays an im portant role in the pathogenesis of coronary artery inflammation in this model.   
In summary, KD patients show activation of TNF -α pathway, and animal models show that TNF -α antagonism 
abrogates coronary artery inflammation.     
 
Pentoxifylline is a methyl- xanthine compound and phosphodiesterase inhibitor that inhibits TNF -α messenger 
RNA transcription.  A single study showed a trend towards improved prevention of CAD when using 
pentoxifylline in addition to ASA and low dose IVIG, compared to ASA and low dose (IVIG 1 gm/kg total)29.  
The study had relatively few patients and was likely not empowered to detect significant differences between groups.  Furthermore, the subsequent development of more specific TNF antagonists relegates this strategy to 
obscurity.   The study does suggest that early and prolonged antagonism of the TNF -α pathway might prevent 
CAD in KD patients.  
 The TNF antagonists fall into 2 classes: monoclonal antibodies and soluble receptors
30. Etanercept (Enbrel®, 
Thousands Oaks, CA) is a soluble TNF receptor, while infliximab (Remicade®, Horsham, PA) and adalimumab (Humira®, Abbott Park, ILL) are monoclonal antibodies against TNF.  These agents are now widely used for 
the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis including juvenile onset and other inflammatory diseases. As of December 2006, more than 400,000 patients worldwide had been treated wi th etanercept and more than 500,000 had been

clinical trials worldwide31.  Infliximab is used for inflammatory bowel disease in children, while Etanercept is 
FDA approved for use in JRA for children down to 2 years of age.  
1.2 Investigational Agent  
Etanercept , a dimeric fusion protein, consists of 2 molecules of the extracell ular ligand -binding portion of 
human TNF receptor 2 attached to the Fc domain of human IgG131. Infliximab is a chimeric IgG1 monoclonal 
antibody composed of human constant and murine variable regions 32, whereas adalimumab is a recombinant 
human IgG1 monoclonal antibody33. Each infliximab or adalimumab molecule can bind up to 2 TNF molecules; 
a single TNF homotrimer can bind up to [ADDRESS_30247], etanercept 
binds to the int erface of 2 TNF subunits in a 1:[ADDRESS_30248] without inducing adverse effects or resistance.   
However, it is also possible that the monoclonal antibodies may be more potent and effective inhibitors of TNF.  
The pharmacokinetics of the drugs delivered by [CONTACT_30933], etanercept and adalimumab, show that blood concentration levels are subjected to less severe peaks and troughs than infliximab, delivered by 
[CONTACT_5204]
36, 37.  
 
In 2004, isolated case reports of infliximab use for refractory KD began to appear in the literature38.  Burns et al 
then retrospectively reviewed the experience of clinicians in the [LOCATION_002], who had used inflixmab for KD patients with either persistent vasculitis or persistent or recrudescent fever > 48 hours after treatment with IVIG 
39.   None of these publications discuss exactly why infliximab was chosen over other TNF inhibitors.  This is 
curious as pharmacokinetics and safety data in younger children, was and is available for Etanercept alone40, 41.  
The retrospective analysi s performed by [CONTACT_30934] , indicated by [CONTACT_30935], was documented in 10/16 patients39.  Infliximab therapy was initiated late in the disease and the majority 
of these patients already had coronary vasculitis prior to administration of a TNF -α blocker.  One patient wit h 
severe coronary artery aneurysms preceding treatment died at home.  The data from this retrospective review served as background to initiate an ongoing clinical phase I trial of infliximab versus repeat IVIG infusion for refractory KS.  No information re garding the progress of this study has been published.  
 
Etanercept for the proposed study is available and will be provided free of charge by [CONTACT_11337] (see 
supporting letter).  
 
Etanercept is FDA -approved for use in the U.S. for reducing signs and symptoms of moderate to severe adult 
rheumatoid arthritis, moderate to severe juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and chronic moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.  It has bee n approved for use in patients 2 years of age and 
older (ages <  17 yrs for juvenile rheumatoid arthritis patients only).  Since its market approval in November 
1998, over 400,[ADDRESS_30249] received etanercept therapy42.    
 
Etanercept lowers concentration of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF -α, IL-3 and IL -6 in patients with 
several inflammatory diseases43, 44.   As noted above these cytokines, and in particular, TNF -α, are implicated 
as proinflammatory agents in KD.  Thus, Etanercept modulation of t hese cytokines may reduce inflammation in 
KD.  
 
Potential toxicity:  Randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled trials showed that etanercept treatment had 
significant clinical benefit with minimal toxicity in adults with active rheumatoid arthritis that did not respond 
to other disease modifying drugs45-47. In following, The Pediatric Rheumatology Collaborative Study Group 
evaluated safety and efficacy in children with p olyarticular juvenile rheumatoid arthritis who did not tolerate or 
had an inadequate response to methotrexate48. Patients 4 to 17 years old  received 0.4 mg of etane rcept per

kilogram of body weight subcutaneously twice weekly for up to three months in the initial, open- label part of 
a multicenter trial. Those who responded to treatment then entered a double -blind study and were randomly 
assigned to receive either placebo or etanercept for four months or until a flare of the disease occurred. At the 
end of the open -label study, 51 of the 69 patients (74 percent) had responses to etanercept treatment. In the 
double -blind study, 21 of the 26 patients who received placebo (81 percent) withdrew because of disease flare, 
as compared with 7 of the 25 patients who received etanercept (28 percent) (P=0.003). The median time to 
disease flare with placebo was 28 days, as compared with more than 116 days with etanercept (P<0.001). 
 
 In the open- label study, the most common adverse events were injection- site reactions (39 percent of patients), 
upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_6014] (35 percent), headache (20 percent), rhinitis (16 percent), abdominal pain (16 
percent), vomiting (14 perc ent), pharyngitis (14 percent), nausea (12 percent), gastrointestinal infection (12 
percent), and rash (10 percent).  In the double -blind study, there were no significant differences in the 
frequencies of adverse events between patients who received etaner cept and those who received placebo. 
Injection -site reactions occurred in one patient in each of the treatment groups in the double -blind study. There 
were no laboratory abnormalities requiring urgent treatment in the etanercept group.    
 In an open label  extension study after 4 years of treatment 
49, the rate of SAEs was 0.13 per patient -year, and the 
rate of serious infections was 0.04 per patient -year, in a t otal etanercept exposure of 225 patient -years.   Serious 
infections included postoperative chin implant infection (n=1), wound infection (n=1), severe gastroenteritis (n=1), herpes zoster (n =1), and appendicitis (n = 1).  The investigators concluded that Etanercept offered sustained benefit and an acceptable safety profile in children with JRA down to age 4 years.  
 
Heart Failure:    TNF -α antagonists have been linked to heart failure. This may be a concern as many patients 
with KD have myocarditis.   In fa ct, Etanercept (Enbrel) has not been implicated in worsening of heart failure. 
Two Enbrel studies for chronic heart failure were terminated due to lack of efficacy, not because of an increase 
in mortality or adverse events.   However, a study with inflixim ab was stopped early because of increased 
mortality in the treatment group. In this regard, Enbrel appears to have a superior safety profile compared to 
Infliximab.  In their review of TNF α antagonism and heart failure, Gullestad and Aukrust 
50 highlight the 
differences between these two drugs.  The chimeric anti -TNF -α antibody (Infliximab), which is studied in

a fusion protein containing two portions of the TNF α receptor.    Burns et al review of KD patients receiving 
Infliximab shows no cases of heart failure or complications in KD patients, except for one death 39. This patient

indicating increased risk of heart failure in y oung patients receiving Etanercept, and certainly no data 
substantiating increase risk after treatment with Etanercept for a very short term course, such as two  or three 
weeks.   
 In summary: the data show that Etanercept is well- tolerated with few advers e effects in a Pediatric population, 
and no more SAEs occur in the treatment group than the placebo group when given for several months.     Cost:   Etanercept (Enbrel at $170/25mg -vial) is inexpensive relative to cost of IVIG (pharmacy cost = $60/gm)

agreed that this SAE was unrelated to Etanercept, but emphasized the importance of eliminating other infectious diseases, when making the diagnosis of KD.  
 Efficacy:    This was a single arm open label design and not an efficacy study.   However, we can make s alient 
comments about these data.   Unfortunately, a protocol deviation resulted in one patient receiving a second dose of IVIG for a fever spi[INVESTIGATOR_2531] [ADDRESS_30255] -IVIG fever spi[INVESTIGATOR_2531].  Otherwise, no other 
patient demonstrated IVIG refractoriness. According to our institutional data (Table 3), we expected at least two and possibly three patients with IVIG refractoriness in t his group.  Among the 4 eligible patients refusing 
enrollment, one patient demonstrated recrudescent fever, was readmitted and treated with a second dose of IVIG. Ten study patients showed normalization of CRP by [CONTACT_941] 7 day visit indication suppression of a cute phase

1.4 Dose Rationale  
 Etanercept is slowly absorbed after subcutaneous (SC) injection, and the absolute bioavailability is 
approximately 58% in adults37. Etanercept has a relatively small v olume of distribution of 12 ±6 and is slowly 
absorbed to reach its peak serum concentration about 50 hours after injection and cleared from the body with a reported m edian half -life of 115 hours
37. The recommended dosing regimen for JRA patients (4- 17 years) at the 
time of its initial approval was 0.4 mg/kg (up to 25 mg) twice weekly by [CONTACT_10530]40. 
    
 
 
 
 
 
 
       
         
 
 However, based on its slow absorption and elimination and pharmacokinetic (PK) profile, a doubled dose with 
a half -frequency regimen (ie, 0.8 mg/kg [up to 50mg]) of a once -weekly SC injection was sought a nd FDA 
approved for patient convenience.   PK simulation studies using data from juvenile rheumatoid arthritis  (JRA) 
patients receiving 0.4 mg/kg SC twice weekly show  similar steady -state levels at 1 and 8 weeks for  children 
receiving 0.8 mg/kg
41.  After repeated subcutaneous treatment  mean serum etanercept concentration was 2100 
ng/ml (range 700 to 4300 ng/ml).  Although eighteen JRA patients were between age 4 and 8 years, relatively few patients were under age 5 years.  The data in Figures  2 A and 3A  illustrate drug concentrations from the 
JRA population and are extracted from Yim et al 
41.    These can be compared to the PK profiles for the two 
different drug doses used in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] (data shown in Figs 2B and 3B).  The pharmacokinetic profiles for 5  
pi[INVESTIGATOR_30868], receiving 0.4mg/kg weekly ( Figure  2.B), show  lower than therapeutic levels , defined by 5th 
to 95th %tile range in shown in 2A for JRA patients receiving twice weekly doses. Steady state concentrations 
after 0.8 mg/kg after 1 week (Figure 3 B) are within the simulated and therapeutic range calculated for the JRA 
group (3A).    Etanercept 0.4 mg/kg

[CONTACT_30939].   The young er age of the KD patients does not substantially affect absorption and 
metabolism of etanercept.  Three enrolled patients less than 2 years of age showed similar pharmacokinetic profile to all other patients and JRA patients.  These patients also showed no  adverse events from Etanercept.  
 
2 Study Objectives  
 Kawasaki Disease (KD) or Syndrome is the leading cause of acquired heart disease in children the [LOCATION_002].  The Center for Disease Control estimates that over 4000 U.S. children per year are diagnos ed with KD.    
Although, KD qualifies for Orphan Disease status by [CONTACT_30940], it is a growing and important health problem for children in the U.S. and worldwide.  KD is an autoimmune disease and vasculitis with a specific predilection for coro nary arteries, causing aneurysm and/or ectasia.  Although, the majority of patients 
do well, many experience long term coronary artery abnormalities.   Studies in Japan where KD demonstrates exceptionally high prevalence indicate that the mortality rate in  males with coronary artery lesions is more than 
twice expected.  Treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin and aspi[INVESTIGATOR_30870].  New and emerging data show that this treatment is only partially effective for reducing the risk of coronary artery disease.  Additionally, KD in many patients demonstrates resistance or refractoriness to IVIG, and requires retreatment.   This refractoriness represents a primary risk factor for development of coronary ar tery dilation. Attempts at developi[INVESTIGATOR_30871].   Over the past [ADDRESS_30259] provided strong evidence 
implicating tumor necrosis -α (TNF -α) as a primary agent for inflammation  in acute KD.  TNF -α antagonism 
with etanercept abrogates coronary artery disease in a validated mouse model of KD.   Etanercept , a dimeric 
fusion protein, consists of 2 molecules of the extracellular ligand- binding portion of human TNF receptor 2 
attached to the Fc domain of human IgG.  Etanercept is FDA approved for multiple indications in adults and in children down to four years of age for juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA).   We performed a pi[INVESTIGATOR_30872] 0.8 mg/kg

KD patients (age 6 months to 5 years). In this population, we demonstrated that etancercept (0.8 mg/kg) 
given subcutaneously at weekly intervals in [ADDRESS_30261] 
this hypothesis we will perform a double -blinded placebo controlled trial in 196 children with KD and obtain 
data in order to achieve an orphan designation for etanercept.  
 
Primary Aim  
1. Determine if etanercept (0. 8 mg/kg, maximum 50 mg) given subcutaneously reduces IVIG refractory rate and 
retreatment rate in the KD patient population.  Our goal is to randomize and complete the trial in [ADDRESS_30262] acebo group.  
2. Determine if etanercept treatment alters the rate of coronary artery dilation and disease (CAD) defined by z -
scores at 2 and 6 weeks after treatment.  
3. Determine the pharmacokinetics of etanercept in KD patients  
 
3 Research Design and Methods  
 
 We propose a placebo- controlled randomized double blind multi- center  study in patients , age 2 months to 20 
years , with acute Kawasaki disease.  All study investigators will be blinded except for pharmacists.  
 
3.1 Primary  clinical endpoint  
The primary aim of  this study is to determine if Etanercept (Enbrel) 0.8 mg/kg given subcutaneously to patients 
with acute Kawasaki Disease will reduce the incidence of IVIG refractoriness as defined in the joint American Heart Association and American Academy of Pediatrics  Endorsed Clinical Report:  “Refractory Kawasaki 
Disease will be defined as the persistence or recrudes cence of fever (≥38.0°C or 100.4°F) at leas t 36 hours after 
the end of the IVIG infusion”
3.   
 Rationale  for primary endpoint :  Refractory KD is an objective clinically important and easily measured 
parameter.  Orphan product indications by [CONTACT_30941]. Refractoriness increases risk of coronary artery disease, number of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_30873]
11.  Several studies have unsuccessfully use d coronary artery dilation 
(CAD) as a primary end point  to evaluate adjunctive therapy 13, 14.Risks in using CAD are:  intr a-observer and 
inter-observer variability.  Although, we will have a central echocardiographic reader, subjectivity is introduced 
by [CONTACT_30942].  Coronary artery dimensions can be skewed by [CONTACT_30943], 
machine settings and oth er parameters beyond the control of the reader.  Therefore, coronary artery dilation 
parameters will be relegated to secondary endpoints.

Secondary  safety endpoints will be number of adverse events, serious or otherwise within 30 days of treatment, 
with specific focus on serious infections, defined as “those requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063]” for treatment. The latter have b een noted in patients receiving much longer course s of etanercept  than proposed for this protocol, 
and for different diseases.     Our study will be the first to evaluate efficacy of Etanercept in reducing  inflammation  in an acute inflammatory 
disease in c hildren, as opposed to chronic inflammatory diseases.  The acute phase reactant, C -reactive p rotein, 
will be followed throughout the study as a laboratory measure of inflammation.   We will also determine if 
etanercept modifies serum concentrations of cyto kines, interleukin- 3, interleukin- 6, and TNF -α.  
 
We propose the largest cohort for study of Etanercept in children performed to date.   
 Secondary clinical endpoints will be directed to d etermine if etanercept treatment alters the rate of coronary 
artery disease defined by z -scores at 2 and 6 weeks after treatment.  
 We will also determine if  etan ercept treatment  1) alters development of coronary artery dilation or disease in 
patients with normal coronaries on initial echocardiogram, 2) promotes healing of coronary artery disease, when apparent on initial echocardiogram, 3) alters treatment course by [CONTACT_30944][INVESTIGATOR_30874], 
and 4) incidence of CRP normalization by 7 days.   
 
3.3 Dosing  
 
Etanercept or placebo will be administered in three separate doses (0.8 mg/kg subcutaneously , maximum 50 
mg) at [ADDRESS_30264] dose concurrent with IVIG or within 48 hours of initiating IVIG.    
 
Rationale for extended therapy:  Current KD treatment with IVIG and ASA in the [LOCATION_002] is based on 
efficacy comparison  with ASA alone8.  Subsequent ly, studies showed no difference in efficacy between IVIG 
(400 mg/kg) given in 4 separate doses on consecutive days versus a single infusion IVIG (2 gm/kg) over [ADDRESS_30265] 
twice weekly.  Normalization of CRP level in the placebo group (receiving IVIG and ASA, no corticosteroid) 
occurred in  9.0 days (median) range 4 to 42 and mean 11.2 ± 6.[ADDRESS_30266] that Etanercept levels are maintained at a near steady -state by [CONTACT_5875] 2, w e will give the final 
dose at 14 days ±  [ADDRESS_30267] 3 weeks.

196 study particip ants will be recruited from the four participating medical center admissions for suspected 
Kawasaki Disease with IVIG administration. Seattle Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_30875]. 
Most patients will be on the Cardiology or General Medicine Service.   
 
4.1 Inclusi on criteria:  
  
Iden tification of patients with KD:  
The American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Heart Association have published guidelines for 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_30876].   KD treatment, including IVIG and aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] , is recommended for patients fitting 
these criteria.  Generally, supportive laboratory data also exist including elevation of erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C reactive protein (CRP > 3.0, although usually much higher). Thrombocytosis (platelet count >  
500,000) usually occurs in the second week.     
 
- Patients in this study (age 2 months to 20 years) will fit the standard epi[INVESTIGATOR_30877]/AAP guidelines or fit criteria for diagnosis of incomplete KD  as 
described below .  Patients will be enrolled only after a clinical decision to treat with IVIG has been 
made by [CONTACT_1963].  
- Patients may be enrolled if they begin IVIG infusion within 10- [ADDRESS_30268] day of fever. A patient may be enrolled with greater than 10 days of fever upon 
written approval  or email confirmation  from the study Principal Investigator ([CONTACT_30974]) on a case by 
[CONTACT_413].  
- Parents of subject  or non -minor subject  must be able an d willing to give written informed consent and 
comply with the requirements of the study protocol and must authorize release and use of protected 
health information.  
 Patients will fit American Heart Association, American Academy of Pediatric guidelines fo r diagnosis of 
Kawasaki Disease  
Fever persisting at least 5 days†  
Presence of at least 4 principal features:  
1) Changes in extremities  
Acute: Erythema of palms, soles; edema of hands, feet  
Subacute : Periungual peeling of fingers  
2) Polymorphous exanthem  
3) Bilatera l bulbar conjunctival injection without exudate  
4) Changes in lips and oral cavity: Erythema, lips cracking,  
strawberry tongue, diffuse injection of oral and  
pharyngeal mucosae  
5) Cervical lymphadenopathy ( 1.5-cm diameter), usually  
unilateral  
 
Patients with feve r at least 5 days and 3 principal criteria can be diagnosed with Kawasaki disease when 
coronary artery abnormalities  are detected by 2 dimensional  echocardiography (see section  on 
Echocardiography ). A qualifying echocardiogram is defined as coronary artery  z score > 2.5 in the proximal 
coronary artery or left anterior descending, or aneurysm by [CONTACT_30945].

The table below provides anticipated numbers of patients eligible from four  U.S. and one Canadian Center, and 
anticipated numbers of recruited patients based on recruitment rates from pr ior studies.   From CHMRC , 
estimates ar e based on KD patients per year and our recruitment rate in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], which enrolled patient in 
the narrow age range 6 months to 5 years. From Primary Children’s in Utah , estimates are based on their 
recruitmen t rate and participation in the Pediatric Heart Network  “Randomized trial of pulsed corticosteroid 
therapy for primary treatment of Kawasaki disease”.  From Milwaukee Children’s  and Cohen Children’s 
Medical Center , estimates are based on KD admission rate and recruitment rate as adjunctive center for PHN 
protocols . Sainte -Justine Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_30880]- Myers -Squibb sponsored 
studies evaluating Cardiolite in Kawasaki Patients (Study # 301 (see description under Key Personnel and Sites of Investigation).   Each center has clinical research structure and team permanently in place and structured.   
 
 
4.[ADDRESS_30276] Recruitment and Screening  
 Patients will be recruited from admissions at participating centers for suspected KD with IV IG administration.  
Families of Kawasaki Disease patients will be referred to the research team by [CONTACT_30947].   In general, the Cardiology service is involved with KD patient’s evaluation and care immediately after admission. Sta ndard clinical care usually includes a screening or baseline echocardiogram. Patients will be 
screened for study suitability by [CONTACT_16133].   If the family shows interest in the study, they will undergo 
consent procedures, which will be conducted by  [CONTACT_5051].  The study will be described verbally to the 
patient and family. After the introduction and description of the study, the family will be given adequate time to read and review the written consent/ assent forms. Time will be allotted for  questions and additional discussion 
if necessary. Family friends, relatives or additional support persons (at the request of the parent/guardian) may also be present to hear and read what is being asked of the patient/family.  
 Patients will be enrolled on ly after the necessary criteria for KD diagnosis has been documented in the medical 
record and  serious infection as the source of fever has been r easonably eliminated . Patients will be screened 
prior to IVIG, but will not be enrolled until IVIG orders are written.

6.3 Visit 3 (Day 7 ± 72 hours) - Clinic  
A physical assessment and a blood draw (a pproximately 7 cc) are required. A nurse may perform an abbreviated 
physical exam as part of the nursing assessment, since a physician investigator is not required to be present at 
this visit. A numbing agent may be used to decrease the discomfort associated with phlebotomy and/or study drug administration. The bl ood sample is sent to the laboratory for the tests listed in the study schema, while  
study personnel will process the PK sample and store for later shippi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. A nurse administers a subcutaneous injection of study medication at the appropriate dosage .

A physical exam and a blood draw (approximately 7 cc) are required.  . The blood sample is sent to the 
laboratory for the tests listed in schema.  An Echo/ EKG is performed. No study drug is administered.  
6.6   Treatment for refractorines s to IVIG.   
All patients who fit the requirements for refractoriness to IVIG (see section 3.1) will receive standard clinical treatment as determined by [CONTACT_30951].  Standard treatment is usually a second dose of IVIG, and is defined in the A merican Heart Association guidelines.  Retreatment with IVIG will not interrupt the study and 
study medication should still be administered.    
6.6 Follow -up Echocardiogram  Surveillance  
Follow up data will be collected for patients w ho had a positive echo (z score ≥ 2.5 or aneurysm) at visit 5 for 
14 months following their diagnosis or until their echo normalizes . De-identified visit note s and 
echocardiogram and angiogram reports that fall within this window should be sent to the study sponsor.   
 
6.7  Echo cardiography  
In order to maintain consistency with other U.S clinical trials in KD17, coronary artery dimensions will be 
normalized for body surface area as z scores (SDs from a predicted normal mean) .  Coronary artery Z -scores are 
based on nonlinear regression equations derived from a nor mal nonfebrile population,  comprised of 221 
healt hy children aged 0 to 18 years seen in the noninvasive laboratory at [LOCATION_011] Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_30892] 1987 to 2000 55.  These patients  had no evidence of structural or 
functional heart disease.   Z-scores algorithms are available and will be determined for the left main coronary

 In order to limit interobserver variability, a central Echocardiography reader will adjudicate these 
interpretations.  Presence of coronary artery aneurysms will be determined using Japanese Ministry of Health 
Criteria :  aneurysm diameter ≥  1.[ADDRESS_30291] and spent an extra year in an imaging fellowship, prior to 
taking a faculty position at CHRMC -UW.   He is intimately familiar with procedures used to develop z -scores 
from the cohort of patients at [LOCATION_011] Children’s and will provide consistency for the echo determinations.        
 
6.[ADDRESS_30292] and pharmacy technical staff will be not be blinded.  The study statistician will provide each 
site pharmacy with randomization table.   Pharmacists will supply each patient with drug  or placebo, both 
provided by [CONTACT_30953].   Pharmacists will draw dose in syringes and dispense to nursing 
for administration.    Drug accountability will be monitored by [CONTACT_30954].  Study 
randomization codes and links  to patients will be kept in secure records in pharmacy. All other study personnel 
involved in administration of drug will be blinded.  
 
6.9 IVIG  Retreatment  
As noted in section 3.1: The primary aim of  this study is to determine if Etanercept (Enbrel) 0.8  mg/kg given 
subcutaneously to patients with acute Kawasaki Disease will reduce the incidence of IVIG refractoriness as defined in the joint American Heart Association and American Academy of Pediatrics Endorsed Clinical Report:  “Refractory Kawasaki Disease will be defined as the persistence or recrudes cence of fever (≥38.0°C or 
100.4°F) at least 36 hours after the end of the IVIG infusion”
3.    Persistent or recrudescent fever is the sole 
criteria for determining the need for retreatment.  The clinical decision can be supported by [CONTACT_30955] s uch as CRP. The protocol requires waiting at 
least [ADDRESS_30293] IVIG dose before initiating the second dose.   
 
 
7 Statistical Design and Analysis  
 
The primary outcome variable is the Y/N determination of whether the subject is refract ory to IVIG 
treatment, defined as persistence of fever >38 ° C beyond 36 hours from  completion  of IVIG treatment, or 
recurrence of fever within 10 days, and clinical decision to retreat with IVIG.  Chi -square testing will be used to 
compare the proportions of subjects classified as refractory to IVIG treatment between the group randomized to 
receive Etanercept as an adjunctive therapy and the group randomized to receive placebo.  If necessary (due to 
low cell counts), a Fisher’s Exact test can be substituted .  Stratified versions of the chi -square and Fisher’s tests 
are available in StatXact (Cytel Incorporated) to allow stratification by [CONTACT_384].   
Secondary outcome variables that are measured on a continuous scale include the coronary artery 
diameters obtain ed on the LMCA, pLAD and pRCA and the corresponding Z -scores (normalized for the 
patient’s BSA) at each of those locations.  Z -scores will be summarized at each time point by [CONTACT_30956]- subject changes in Z -score relative to baseline wi ll be summarized for the post -treatment time 
points (week 1 and week 5) as well.  The within- subject changes in actual artery diameter will also be 
summarized at week 1 and week 5.  Summary statistics will include the mean, SD and selected percentiles.

Equation (GEE) model will be used to compare cha nge values between the Etanercept and placebo groups.  The 
GEE model is needed to accommodate adjustment for the correlation between observations obtained on the 
same individual at [ADDRESS_30295] 
on change in artery diameter depending on whether the artery was dilated at baseline, terms for dilation status at baseline and the interaction between dilation and treatment group will be included in the model.   
Another secondary outcome i s the presence of aneurysm as defined by [CONTACT_30957] (see Echo criteria above).  The pre - and post -treatment proportions of subjects in each group having an 
aneurysm detected will be calculated along with the exact binomial 95% co nfidence interval.  Comparison of 
post-treatment aneurysm proportions will be done via a stratified Chi -square test, with strata for 
presence/absence of aneurysm at baseline.    
Adverse events will be tabulated for each treatment group by [CONTACT_926], relatio nship to study drug and 
body system affected (according to the NCI CTC grading and MEDDRA classification system). The outcome of 
any SAE epi[INVESTIGATOR_30893]. Adverse event rates will be compared between treatment groups using Poisson or negative binomial regression modeling.  The proportions of subjects experiencing an 
adverse event of any type and the proportions experiencing an SAE will be compared using chi -square or 
Fisher’s Exact testing.  
 Pharmacokinetic analyses:      PK analyses w ill be performed after completion of the study and unblinding, so 
as not to unblind study investigators. Samples from patients receiving etanercept will be forwarded to the Seattle site for storage and then later submitted to [COMPANY_010] for determination of ser um drug concentrations.  Peak 
and trough analyses will be performed.   Drug clearance, volume of distribution and ½ life will be determined using etanercept modeling and algorithms 
[ADDRESS_30296] laboratory studies will be performed in the clinical laboratory of each participating 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  Serum cytokines, IL -3, IL -6, and TNF α will be performed in Center of Developmental Therapeutics 
at Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_30894].  Assay will be performed on Luminex -200 multiplex 
system, which resides in center.  
 
8 Safety and Adverse Events  
8. 1 Definitions 
Adverse Event  
An adverse event  (AE) is any symptom, sign, illness or experience that develops or worsens in s everity during 
the course of the study.  Intercurrent illnesses or injuries should be regarded as adverse events.  Abnormal 
results of diagnostic procedures are considered to be adverse events if the abnormality:  
• results in study withdrawal 
• is associated w ith a serious adverse event  
• is associated with clinical signs or symptoms  
• leads to additional treatment or to further diagnostic tests  
• is considered by [CONTACT_30958] s erious or non -serious.  A serious adverse event  is any AE that is:  
• fatal

• life-threatening  
• requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]  
• results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
• an important medical event 
 
Important medical events are those that may not be immediately life threatening, but are clearly of major 
clinical significance.   They may jeopardize the subject, and may require intervention to prevent one of the other serious outcomes noted above.  For exa mple, drug overdose or abuse, a seizure that did not result in in- patient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_30895].  
All adverse events that do not meet any of the criteria for serious should be regarded as non- serious adverse 
events.  
Adverse Event Reporting Period  
The study period during which adverse events must be reported is normally defined as the period from the 
initiation of any study procedures to the end of the study tr eatment follow -up.  For this study, the study 
treatment follow -up is defined as [ADDRESS_30297] administration of study treatment.   
Preexisting Condition  
A preexisting condition is one that is present at the start of the study.   
General Physica l Examination Findings  
At screening, any clinically significant abnormality should be recorded as a preexisting condition.  At the end of 
the study, any new clinically significant findings/abnormalities that meet the definition of an adverse event must 
also be recorded and documented as an adverse event.  
Post-study Adverse Event  
All unresolved adverse events should be followed by [CONTACT_1374], the subject is 
lost to follow -up, or the adverse event is otherwise explained.  At the last scheduled visit, the investigator 
should instruct each subject to report any subsequent event(s) that the subject, or the subject’s personal physician, believes might reasonably be related to participation in this study.   
Abnormal Laboratory V alues  
A clinical laboratory abnormality should be documented as an adverse event if any one of the following  
conditions is met:  
• The laboratory abnormality is not otherwise refuted by a repeat test to confirm the abnormality  
• The abnormality suggests a dise ase and/or organ toxicity  
• The abnormality is of a degree that requires active management; e.g. change of dose, discontinuation of 
the drug, more frequent follow -up assessments, further diagnostic investigation, etc. 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], Prolonged Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_28688] a serious adverse event unless specifically instructed otherwise in this protocol.  Any condition responsible for surgery should be documented as an adverse event if the condition meets the criteria for and adverse event.

Neither the condition, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], nor surgery are reported as an adverse event 
in the following circumstances:  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5186] n or prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_30896] a preexisting 
condition.  Surgery should not  be reported as an outcome of an adverse event if the purpose of the surgery 
was elective or diagnostic and the outcome was uneven tful. 
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14843], unless it is a 
worsening or increase in frequency of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14844].  (Note:  
This study population includes a notable proportion of patients requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_30897]. A clear definition of a serious adverse event  relating to readmissions will be 
determined at the Organizational Meeting with the Data Monitoring Committee.)  
Expect ed Adverse Events  
The following AEs are expected with Kawasaki Disease and IVIG:  
Fever, chills, sore throat, chest tightness, rash, redness of the eyes, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, nausea, irritability, meningismus, anaphylaxis or hypersensitivity, hypotension, rash, skin peeling or desquamation, extremity swelling, coronary arteritis, coronary aneurysms, myocardial infarction, myocarditis, mitral regurgitation, pericarditis, hydropic gall bladder, joint swelling or pain, lymphadenopathy, arrhythmias, blood clots.

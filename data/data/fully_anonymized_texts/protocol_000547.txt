Test Alticle( s) I 
Prod uct(s):  The Ac1ySofIQ PanOptix Intraocu lar lens (IOL) Mode l TFNT00 is a 
single-pi[INVESTIGATOR_294108]. 
The biconvex optic is 6.[ADDRESS_358126] ive strncture is in the 
centra l 4.5 mm p01t ion o f the anterior surface of the optical zone and 
divides  the incoming light to create a +2.17 D inte1mediat e and a 
+3.25 D near add power  (IOL  plane) in addition to the distance  focus. 
The anterior surface  is designed  with 0.IO µm of negat ive spherical 
aben  ation to compensate  for the positive spherical  abe1rntion  of the 
average human  cornea.  
 
The Ac1ySofIQ PanOpt ix IOL is indicated for p rima1y implantation in 
the capsular bag in the poste rior chamber for the visual conection  
of aphak ia in adult subjects with less than I diopter of pre-existing 
cornea l astigma tism in whom a catarac tous lens has been removed. 
The lens mitigates the effects of p resby[CONTACT_294120]1media te and near visual acuity compared  to a monofocal 
IOL.

of the IOLSA T questionnaire (Overa ll, in the past 7 days, how 
often did you need to wear eyeg lasses to see?) at Month 6. 
alysis of each co-prima1yeffectiveness endpo int and the first seconda1y

anOptix IOL minus Ac1ySof Monofoca l IOL) and the assoc iated 
onfidence interva ls for  all  3 aforemen tioned endpo ints. The non- 
feriority hypo thesis will be deemed suppmted  if  the  upper 95% 
onfidence limit is less than the non -inferiority margin of 0.1 logMAR.  
Super iority hypotheses will be deemed suppmted if the uppe r 97.5%

Super iority will be decla red if the lower 97.5% confidence limit exceeds  
 
 
he co-primaiy safety objectives are to  
• Estimate the cumu lative rate of secondary smg ical intervent ions 
related to the op tical prope1t ies of the IOL for first operative eyes 
up to Month  6 
• Evaluate the mean binocu lar contrast se nsitivity w ith and without

Sample Size 
Justification  Approximately 250 subjects will be bilaterally implanted with either the 
AcrySof IQ PanOptix IOL Model TFNT00 or the AcrySof Monofocal  IOL 
Model SN60AT in a 1:[ADDRESS_358133] gro up and the control group. This 
assumes a drop -out rate of 10%,  approximately.  
 
Power calculations for the effectiveness objectives are summarized in the 
table below:  
  
Margin  Expected 
Difference  Std. 
dev Type I 
error  
(1-sided)   
Power  
Non- Inferiority       
BCDVA (4 m)  0.1 0.0 0.18 5% 99% 
Superiority       
DCNVA (40 cm)   0.1 0.18 2.5%  98% 
DCIVA (66 cm)   0.1 0.18 2.5%  98% 
Spectacle Wear   20%  2.5%  83% 
All expected differences for tests of superiority favor the test lens. Estimates of VA endpoints 
reported in logMAR.  
 
Adverse Events: For any event where a [ADDRESS_358134] binomial 95% confidence limit is less than 3%. Thus, with 95% 
confidence, the true adverse event rate is less than 3%.

generally correcting a subject’s distance vision. However, many pseudophakic subjects 
implanted with monofocal IOLs ultimately require reading glasses to compensate for the loss  of 
the ability to see clear at intermediate or near distances. Several IOL designs for treating 
presby[CONTACT_294128] m odern day clinical practice, including the use of 
multifocal IOLs. Multifocal IOLs offer the subject an opportunity to overcome the loss of 
accommodation by [CONTACT_294129]. The majority of commercially available 
multifocal IOLs have 2 opti cal zones – one that provides distance vision and a second that 
provides near vision. The investigational AcrySof IQ PanOptix IOL Model TFNT00 test IOL 
(hereto referenced as TFNT00) improves on commercially available multifocal IOLs by 
[CONTACT_294130]. The TFNT00 has a multifocal optical 
design that provides distance vision, near vision at approximately 40 cm and intermediate 
vision at approximately 60 cm. The control lens, the AcrySof Monofocal IOL Model SN60AT 
(hereto referenced as SN60AT) is a monofocal which provides distance vision  only.  
 
The purpose of this clinical study is to compare the visual outcomes of this multifocal IOL 
against that of a monofocal lens, the AcrySof Monofocal IOL Model SN60AT, in order to 
demonstrate comparable distance vision and superior near and intermediate visi on. 
 
7.2 Clinical Trial  Design  
This study is a prospective, multicenter, non -randomized, vision assessor -masked, parallel - 
group confirmatory trial. It compares an investigational trifocal IOL and a commercially 
available monofocal IOL.  
(Note that neither las er nor any other 
types of refractive procedures are allowed at any time in the clinical trial.) The study will 
include adults (≥22 years of age) who require bilateral cataract extraction. Potential subjects 
will be screened for enrollment into the trial. T hose qualifying will attend a total of 10 visits 
(7 visits occur postoperatively) over a [ADDRESS_358145] consent, the electronic data 
capture (EDC) system will assign the subject number. To mitigate the risk of bias, the assessor

will be masked for all vision assessments. The subject will be provided with his/her pe1manent 
implant card at the time of implant. 
 
Standard clinical tria l method s that minimiz e bias in multicenter studies will be used such as

9.4 Procedures per Study  Visit  
Section 12 Clinical Trial Procedures contains procedures per study visit.  
 
9.5 Known and Potential  Risks  
Complications may occur on the surgery day or throughout the postoperative period. As with 
any type of intraocular surgery, there is a possibility of complications due to anesthesia, drug 
reactions, and surgical problems. The surgical procedure can exacerb ate a pre -existing ocular 
condition. Possible problems during surgery include corneal endothelial touch, detached 
Descemet’s membrane, iris damage, iris prolapse, iris trauma, iris incarceration, zonular 
rupture, vitreous loss, capsulorhexis tear, capsular  rupture, uncontrollable intraocular pressure, 
hyphema,  and retinal  damage.  An IOP  increase  may occur from  the surgical  procedure,  residual 
viscoelastic in the eye, or a steroid response to postoperative  medications.  
 
Additionally, potential postoperative adverse events include but are not limited to corneal 
stromal edema, cystoid macular edema, endophthalmitis, hypopyon, iritis, lens dislocation, 
membrane formation on the IOL, pupi[INVESTIGATOR_32465], retinal detachment, cyclitic membrane, 
transient or persistent glaucoma, retinal tear, vitritis, iris touch, pupil ovalization, posterior 
synechiae, ocular inflammation, ocular discomfort or pain, inflammation, decreased vision, 
decreased contrast sensitivity, decreased color perception, visual disturbances, and corne al 
endothelial cell loss.  
 
An IOL replacement or explantation may be appropriate in some cases of residual refractive 
error, ocular infection, subject dissatisfaction, or visual disturbances (eg, glare, halos, 
starbursts, hazy vision, blurred vision, doubl e vision, visual distortions, and color distortions, 
etc.). An SSI (eg, IOL repositioning, replacement, or explantation) may be appropriate if the 
IOL position significantly differs from the intended placement. Alternatively, spectacles or 
contact [CONTACT_13276] m ay be prescribed to resolve residual refractive error. Other secondary surgical 
interventions include, but are not limited to: IOL repositioning, refractive laser treatment, 
paracentesis,  vitreous  aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1520],  iridectomy  or laser  iridotomy  for pupi[INVESTIGATOR_294114], wound  leak 
repair, and retinal detachment  repair.  
 
A summary of known and potential risks and benefits to humans, as identified in the literature 
or through preclinical testing and/or prior clinical evaluations, for each investigational product 
can be found in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB -0143) and the Directions for Use (AcrySof 
Monofocal IOL Model SN60AT).

9.5.1 Potential  Benefits  
The TFNT00 IOL is a single -pi[INVESTIGATOR_13959], trifocal diffractive lens with a +3.25 D near ADD and  
+2.17 D intermediate ADD intended to provide vision to aphakic subjects at ne ar, intermediate, 
and distance (García -Pérez 2017; Kohnen 2015; Lawless 2017) without the need, in many 
subjects, for additional correction with spectacles or contact [CONTACT_13276].  
 
9.5.2 Risk Benefit  Assessment  
Based on the formal risk assessment, TFNT00 demonstrate s a risk profile that is comparable to 
the FDA -approved ACRYSOF IQ ReSTOR +3.0 Add Power IOL (Model SN6AD1),  
Furthermore, it was concluded that 
the benefits of increased intermediate vision while maintaining visual performance at near 
distance significan tly outweigh the risks of suboptimal surgical outcomes  
when the TFNT00 is used in cataract surgery. Potential risks 
following implantation of the TFNT00 include visual disturbances such as glare and halos 
which are known risks for multifocal IOLs. The ben efits of improved near and intermediate 
vision (Garcia -Perez 2017), when weighed against the risks of visual disturbances, result in a 
benefit to risk profile that is favorable for the both the test and control IOLs.

[ADDRESS_358157]  POPULATION  
The study population includes approximately 250 subjects (125 in each arm) to be bilaterally 
implanted at approximately 12 sites with a minimum of 20 subjects per site (approximately 10 in 
each arm).  
 
Each site should contribute a minimum of 20 subjects but not more than 25% of the total study 
sample size.  
 
Enrollment is anticipated to take approximately [ADDRESS_358158] be ≥ [ADDRESS_358159] extraction in both eyes.  
Additional entry criteria are listed below in Sections 10.1 through 10.3.  
 
Check all entry criteria at baseline (Visit 0) and at both surgical visits (Visit 00, Visit 00A). If a 
subject is ex cluded prior to first eye surgery (IOL does not come in contact [CONTACT_222199]), the 
subject should be discontinued from participation in the study. Refer to Section 12.[ADDRESS_358160] reschedules surgery, and this rescheduling results in preoperative/baseline assessments 
(Visit 0) falling outside of the -30 to 0 day window, assessments should be repeated, and

The TFNT00 IOL is not approved in the [LOCATION_002] (US), and therefore considered 
investigational, but it is a CE marked device that is commercially available in other countries 
across the globe.  
 
The le ns is an ultraviolet and blue -light filtering foldable multifocal IOL of single -pi[INVESTIGATOR_294116] a central optic and 2 open -loop haptics. The optic is 6.0 mm in diameter and the lens has an 
overall diameter of 13.0 mm. The optic consists of a proprietary high refractive index hydrophobic 
acrylic material with a blue light filtering chromophore which filters light in a manner that 
approximates the human crystalline lens in the 400 -475 nm blue light wavelength range (Boettner 
1962). It is biconvex and consis ts of a soft acrylic material capable of being folded prior to 
insertion, allowing placement through an incision smaller than the optic diameter of the lens. After 
surgical insertion into the eye, the lens gently unfolds to its intended shape. The optic di ffractive 
structure is in the central 4.5 mm portion of the optic zone and divides the incoming light to create 
a +2.17 D intermediate and a +3.[ADDRESS_358166] article can be found in IB -0143.

12.3 Unscheduled  Visits  
An unscheduled visit (UNSV) is defin ed as follows:  
 
• Ocular examination that is not standa rd of care and not required by [CONTACT_760]; 
Examination  cond ucted by [CONTACT_5984]; new findin gs, or a change to a previous  findin g 
was discovered ; and Not site standard of care/routine.  
An UNSV may or may not result in the capture of an adverse event. Like wise an adve rse event 
may be captured without the report of an UNSV (eg, AE identifi ed subsequent to study eye 
examination by [CONTACT_105] -study personnel).  
 
The assessments  captured at the UNSV  are dictated by [CONTACT_294137]/her  medic al 
judgment. The following assess ment s are  recommended . 
•  
• Concomitant  medi cations 
• Slit lamp exam includin g IOL position  change  
• Subjective PCO and posterior capsulotomy assessment  
• Grade  cell and flare  accordi ng to SUN  syste m (refer  to MOP for grading scheme)  
• Dilated fundu s exam  
 
• IOP 
• Adverse  events  
• Device deficiencies  
 
Note: Assessments are not limited to the above list. 
 
If the subject is discontinued  at the unsched uled visit, pe1f01m  all Early Exit procedures.  Refer  to 
Section [ADDRESS_358184] ives of the study is to estimate the rate of secon dary surgical 
interventions (SSis) related  to the optical prope11 ise of the IOL for first operative  eye up to month 
6 (Visit 4A). Thi s section is intended to provide guidan ce on the documentation and procedures 
related to SSis in this investigation. 

Printed By : [CONTACT_13277]: Alcon  - Busine ss Use Only  Protocol  - clinical  Effect.ive Date: 28-Mar-2018  Page 51 of79  Document: TDOC - 0053 702  Version: 4. o; Mos t - Re c e n t ; Ef f e c t i v e ; CURRENT   
  
The m ain procedural steps in the decision process for SSis and notification to the Sponsor are 
detailed below. 
 
1. The Investigat or must dete1mine whether an SSI is related  to the optical  prope 1t ies of the IOL.  
 
2. Any SSI (other than posterior  capsulotomy  laser treatment)  perfo1med  for any reason  should be 
recorded  as a serious adverse  event  and reported  to the Sponsor within 24 hours of its occmTence.  
 
Note: If the SSI is a lens exchange or repositioning , the subsequent study post-operative visits 
should be based  on the date of this surge1y.Unsc heduled Visit Case  Report F01ms  (CRFs) should 
be used for other post-operat ive follow -up visits, where applicable. If the study lens is exchanged 
and replaced with a non-study lens, the subject w ill be required to complet e all original 
subsequent study visits through  Visit 4A(6 month s). 
 
Evaluation of Need for a Seco nda1ySurg ical Intervention  
 
• The need  for cons ideration of an SSI include s one or more  of the following:  
 
1. An Investigator assessment of subject's clinical  outcome. 
 
2. A subject spo ntaneou sly complaining about visual symptoms to the investigational site 
personnel.  
 
3. Other reason(s)  for an SSI, e.g., retained lens fragments.  
 
The Investigator  should perfo1m  a thorough evaluation  including  diagnostic  testing  as needed and 
a subject intervie w to understand subject observat ions in detail to dete1mine if an SSI is the 
appropriate treatment for the subject's undesired outcome (e.g., blmT ed vision, v isual 
disturbances /disto1tions , or other reasons). Case management should be based on the 
Investigator's clinical assessment with consideration of the subject's postoperative_  , 
BCDVA, IOL stabi lity after  implantation , and any subjective complaints. Careful  consideration of 
the potential  risks  and benefits  assoc iated with the SSI for the subject is required , and these  should 
be discussed with the subject prior  to electing to repos ition or explant the IOL or othe1w ise 
 
 
Guidance on determining whether the SSI cause is related to the co -primary safety endpoint  
 
 
The following causes are considered unrelated to the optical properties of the IOL:  
 
• 
smgically intervene. For any  visit in which an SSI is planned , 

Printed By : [CONTACT_13277]: Alcon - Business Use Only  
Document: TDOC-0053702 Effective Date: 28-Mar-2018  Protocol - Clinical  Page 52 of 79 Version: 4.0; Most-Recent; Effective; CURRENT   
  
 
 
• Surgical complications noted at the operative visit that may reasonably affect  postoperative 
outcomes  
 
• Pre-existing or newly developed ocular  pathologies  
 
• Corneal disorders (e.g., dry eye syndrome, edema, and corneal  irregularities)  
 
• Macular edema – confirmed by [CONTACT_294138]/or  fluorescein 
angiography  
 
• Anisometropia (≥ 1 D difference in sphere or cylinder between contralateral eyes) due  to 
cataractous lens in fellow eye rather than post -operative outcomes of the first  eye 
 
• Posterior capsular  opacification  
 
• Wearing corrective lenses with unsuitable  prescription  
 
 
The following are considered as related to the optical properties of the IOL:  
 
• IOL repositioning or  explantation/replacement  
 
a) IOL repositioning due to IOL instability (e.g., decentration and  tilt) 
 
b) Subject intolerance of visual symptoms that are not expected to resolve if an SSI 
is not  performed . 
 
 
If the Investigator determines that an SSI is warranted and the reason is not defined above or if 
there is any uncertainty as to whether the SSI is related to the optical properties of the IOL or 
some other, unrelated factor(s), the Investigator should  consult with the Medical Monitor. The 
Investigator should determine the most suitable SSI procedure for each case. Please note that 
limbal relaxing incisions and keratorefractive procedures to address residual refractive error are 
disallowed by [CONTACT_60797]. Subjects who undergo such procedures will be excluded from the best 
case analysis set, but will be evaluable for the safety and all implanted analysis  sets. 
 
Additional recommendations regarding Secondary Surgical Interventions  
 
The following information is not intended to replace or limit the surgeon’s decision -making 
process but rather to establish general guidance for time point and conditions for secondary 
surgical interventions.  
 
1. IOL Repositioning  • 
Printed By : [CONTACT_13277]: Alcon - Business Use Only  
Document: TDOC-0053702 Effective Date: 28-Mar-2018  Protocol - Clinical  Page 53 of 79 Version: 4.0; Most-Recent; Effective; CURRENT   
  
If IOL repositioning is required, it should be done in the early postoperative period before capsule 
fibrosis, preferably within the first [ADDRESS_358185].  
 
2. IOL Explantation and  Replacement  
 
Should explantation of the investigational IOL (AcrySof® IQ PanOptix™ IOL Model TFNT00 ) 
or control IOL (AcrySof® Monofocal IOL Model SN60AT) and IOL replacement be necessary, it 
should be done in the early postoperative period in the case of inaccurate preoperative planning 
and/or surgical error. In the case where an investigational or control IOL is explanted, it should be 
replaced with another Alcon AcrySof® IOL.  
 
In the case of an incorrect IOL power or residual refractive error, any SSI to replace the IOL 
should be considered if the placement of a different IOL power or IOL type i s expected to  improve 
the visual outcomes of the  subject.  
 
In the case where the subject complains of visual disturbances/distortions in the early 
postoperative period, the surgeon should remind the subject that these symptoms generally 
improve over time d ue to neural adaptation. Therefore, adequate time must be allowed for neural 
adaptation to occur. The medical judgment of the Investigator, consultation with the Medical 
Monitor and careful consideration of the potential benefits and risks of the SSI shoul d be 
discussed with the subject. If the subject is intolerant of persistent visual disturbances/distortions 
and the Investigator identifies the primary cause as related to intrinsic IOL properties, lens 
replacement should be  considered.  
 
Summary  
 
The Investigator must consider subject complaints and clinical outcome in his or her consideration 
of the need for a SSI, determine whether the cause of a needed SSI is due to optical properties of 
the IOL, and report findings to the Sponsor within defined  timelines.  
 
Note: Table 18 -2 contains additional indications for secondary IOL interventions and their 
associated definitions. (Masket, 2017).

12.7 7 Clinical Trial  Termination  
The Sponsor reserves  the right  to close the investigational  site or terminate  the study in its entiret y 
at any time,  for reasonable  cause. The Investigator also may terminat e the study at his/her  site for 
reasonable cause. Reasons for the closure  of an investigational site or termination  of a study may 
include : 
 
• The Investigator fails to comply with the protocol  or GCP  guidelines  
• Safety  concerns  
• Inadequ ate recruitment of subjects by [CONTACT_294139] , the Sponsor will inf orm the 
Investigator and the regulat01y authorities (where applicable) of the termi nation/ suspe nsion and 
the reason(s)  for the termi  natio n/suspe nsion. The Investigator  should promptly  notify the IEC/IRB 
of the termination or suspension and of the reasons.  
 
If the Sponsor terminat es the study for safety reasons , it will imm ediately notify the 
Investigator(s), an d provide written instructions for study termination and ap plicable subject 
follow -up.

Secon da1y Surgical Interventions repmting will be sub-categor ized using the fo llowing 
tenni nology: exchange,  removal, and repositioning. Indications and assoc iated definitions for 
these outcomes are provided in Section [ADDRESS_358189] questions: 
 
• "Have yo u had any hea lth problems since your last study visit?" 
• "Have there been any changes in the medicines you take since your last study visit?" 
Changes  in any protocol-specific parameters  and/o r questionnaires evaluated during the study are 
to be reviewed by [CONTACT_737] . Any untowa rd (unfavorab le and unin tended) c hange in a 
protoco l-specific parameter or questionna ire response that is clinically relevant, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_15960], is to be repmted as a n AE. These clinically relevant cha nges w ill be repmte d 
regard less of causality. 
 
13.3 Procedure s for Recording and  Reporting  
AEs are collected from the time of infmme d consent. Any pre-existing medical conditions or 
signs/symp toms present in a subject prior to the start of the study (ie, before informed conse nt is 
signed)  are not cons idered  AEs in the study and should be recorded in the Medical Histmy section 
of the eCRF. 
 
In addition, aqueous cells and fl are, corneal  edema,  raised IOP and  superfic ial  punctate keratitis 
ar·e examp  les o f ear ly post -o pe rative  fi ndi ngs that are typi[INVESTIGATOR_294118] d follow ing ocular surge  ry. 
These are not considered AEs if they can be reasonab ly expected to reso lve within a week and not 
result in any untowa rd long term visual outcome impact.  
 
For each recorded event, the ADEs a nd SAEs docu mentat ion must include : date of occ unence, 
sever ity, treatment (if applicable), outcome, and assessme nts of the seriousness and causality. In 
addition, the Investigator must document all device deficiencies reported or observe d with test and 
contro l articles on the Device Deficiency  eC RF. The site must submit all available inform ation on 
ADEs, SAEs, and device deficiencies to the Study Sponsor imme diately as follows:  
 
• ADEs  or SAEs are documented on the Serious Adverse  Event  and Adverse  Device  Effect  
eCRF within 24 hours of the Investigator's o r site's aware ness. 
• Device deficiencies are docume nted on the Device  Deficiency  eCRF within 24 hours of the 
Investigator's or site's awareness.

• A printed  copy of the complet ed Serious  Adverse  Event  and Adverse  Device  Effect  and/or  
Device Deficienc y eCRF must be included with product returns.  
• Addition al relevant  inf01m at ion after initial  rep01ting  must  be entered  into the eCRF as 
soon as the data become available. 
• Document any changes to conco mitant medi cations on the appropriate  eCRFs.  
• Document all relevant inf01mation from Di scharge Summary , Autopsy  Rep01t , 
• Ce1t ificate of Death etc ., if appli cab le, in nan ati ve sec tion of the Serious Adverse Event and 
Adverse Device Effect  eCRF.  
• UADEs must be rep01ted to the IRB as soon as possible, but not later t han 10 worki ng days 
after the Investigator's or site's aware ness. 
Note: Should the EDC syste m become non-operational, the site must complet e the 
appropria te paper Serious Adverse Event and Adverse Device Effect and/or Device 
Deficie ncy Form.  The completed fo1m  is faxed  or emailed  to the Study Sponsor at 
 or   accor ding to the timelines outlined 
above ; however , the repo1t ed info1m ation must be entered into the EDC  system  once  it 
becomes  operational.  
Any AEs and device deficiencies for non -study marketed devices /products (ie, BSS, OVD, 
Delive1y syste ms, etc.) will be considered and processe d as spontaneo us (following the post- 
market vigilance procedures) and should be  communicated to the device 's/product 's manufacturer 
as per local requirements.  
 
Study Sponsor repre sentatives may be contact[CONTACT_294140].  
 
Fmther , depending upon the nature of the AE or device deficiency being repo1ted, the Study 
Sponsor may request copi[INVESTIGATOR_294119] p01tions of the subject's medical records. The 
Investigator must also repo1ta ll AEs and device deficie ncies that could have led to a SADE 
according to the requir ement s of regulat01y authoritie s or IRB/IEC . 
 
Intensity and Causality Assessments  
 
Where  appropriate , the Investigator must assess  the intensity (severity) of the AE based on 
medical judgment  with considerati on of any subjective sympto m(s), as defined  below: 
 
Inten sity (Severity)  
 
Mild   An AE is mild  if the subject is aware of but can easily tolerate the sign or 
symptom. 

Printed By : [CONTACT_13277]:  Alcon - Business Use Only  
Document: TDOC-0053702 Effective Date: 28-Mar-2018  Protocol - Clinical  Page 60 of 79 Version: 4.0; Most-Recent; Effective; CURRENT   
  
Moderate  An AE is moderate if the sign or symptom results in discomfort significant  enough 
to cause interference with the subject’s usual  activities.  
Severe  An AE is severe if the sign or symptom is incapacitating and results in the subject’s 
inability to work or engage in their usual  activities.  
 
For every AE in the study, the Investigator must assess the causality (Related or Not Related to the 
medical devic e or study procedure). An assessment of causality will also be performed by [CONTACT_294141], as shown below:  
 
Causality  
 
Related  An AE classified as related may be either definitely related or possibly 
related where a direct ca use and effect relationship with the medical device 
or study procedure has not been demonstrated, but there is a reasonable 
possibility that the AE was caused by [CONTACT_294142].  
Not Related  An AE classified as not related may either be definitely unrelated or simply 
unlikely to be related (ie, there are other more likely causes for the  AE).  
The Study Sponsor will assess the AEs and may upgrade the Investigator’s assessment of 
seriousness and/or causality. The Study Sponsor will notif y the Investigator of any AEs that are 
upgraded from non -serious to serious or from unrelated to related.  
13.[ADDRESS_358190] information are provided in the MOP that 
accompanies this protocol.  
 
Alcon Products associated with device deficiencies and/or product related AEs should be returned 
as specified in the MOP and must include t he Complaint # which will be provided by [CONTACT_294143]’s Global Product Complaint Management 
System (GPCMS).

13.6 Follow -Up of Subjects with Adverse  Events  
The Investigator is responsible for adequate and safe medi cal care of s ubjects during the study and 
for ensuring that appropria te medi cal care and relevant follow -up procedures are maintained after 
the study.  
 
The Investigator should provide the study Sponsor with any new safety info1mation (which 
include  s new AEs and changes  to previously  repmte d AEs)  that may affect  the safety evaluation 
of the device. For AEs that are unresolved/ ongoing at time of subject exit from study, any 
additional info1m ation received at follow -up should be document ed in the eCRFs up to study 
completion  (ie, database lock). 
 
Any additional data received up to [ADDRESS_358191] be 
documented and available upon the Study Spo nsor's request. All complaint s received after this 
tin1e period will be cons idered and processed as spo ntaneou s (following the post -market vigilance 
procedures) and should b e communi cated to the medical device 's manufacturer as per local 
requirement s. 
 
The Investigator should r eport comp laints on non-Alcon products directly to the manufacture r as 
per the manufacture r's instiuctions or local regul ato1y requirements.  
 
13. 7 Pregnancy in the Clinical  Trial  
Pregn ancy is not r epmtab le as an AE ; howeve r, compli cations may be repmtable and will be 
decided on a case-by-case basis. An Alcon fo1m will be utilized to capture all pregnancy related 
info1mati on unt il bi1th of the child.  
 
14 DATA REVIEW AND  HANDLING  
14.1 Completion  of Source  Documents  and Case  Report  Forms  
The nature and location of all source document s will be identified to ensure that original data 
required to complete the electi·onic case report fo1ms (eC RFs) exists and are accessible for 
verification by [CONTACT_294144]. It is required  that the author of each  entiy  in the source documents  be 
identifiable  (eg, initials or signature [CONTACT_3670]).  At a minimum , source  documents  should includ e 
the following  info1mation for each subject: 
 
• Subject identification (name, date of bi.1th or age , sex) 
• Documentation of subject  eligibility  
• Date of info1m ed consent  
• Dates of visits 
• Documentation that protocol -specific  procedures were perfo1med

• Res ults of study testin g, as required by [CONTACT_93865]  
• Test a1ticle acco untability records 
• Document ation of SAEs and other safety parameters  (as applicable) 
• Records regarding medical hi stories and the use of concomitant therapie s prior to and 
during the study 
• Date of study completion  and reason  for early  discontinu ation, if applic able 
Note: If electron ic source records are maintained , the method of verification must be determin ed 
in advance of sta1t ing the study. 
 
Direct access to source documentation (medi cal records) must be allowed fo r the purpose of 
verifyin g that the data recorde d on the eCRF are consistent with the original source data. Data 
repo1ted on the eCRFs shall be derived from source document s and be consistent with these 
source documents , and any discrepa ncies shall be explained in writing. Any change or con ection 
to data reported on a source docum ent shall be dated, initialed, and explained if necessa1y , and 
shall not obscure  the original  entry  (i.,e.  an audit  tr·ail shall be maintained)  ; this applies to both 
written and electr·o nic cha nges and con ections. eCRFs shall be signed and dated by [CONTACT_9532] [INVESTIGATOR_022]/her authorized designee (s). 
 
14.2 Data Review and  Clarifications  
Upon completion of the eCRFs, targeted data will be reviewed by [CONTACT_294145] (CSM) team for accuracy and completeness. The planned source 
document verificati on and overall moni toring activities for this study are outlined in a separate 
document , the Proto col Monitorin g Plan. Con ec tions and/or any  necessa 1y  additions to the data 
will be applied and if required , queries will be generated . Designated investigative staff is  
expected to respo nd to data queries in a timely manner and ensure that the con ec tions and changes 
made to the data  are reflected in the subjects' source documentation.  
 
Deviations from this protocol , regulat o1y requir ement s and GCP must be recorded. An explanation 
of the deviation should be includ ed, as applicable. In addition , corTecti ve and preventive action 
should be identified, implemented and documented within the study records. Prior to study start, a 
plan for data validation will be completed by [CONTACT_294146] , and agreed upon by 
[CONTACT_294147]  (CM)  and other  team  member s. 
 
Concomitant medi cations entered into the database will be coded u sing the WHO Drn g Refer ence

hypotheses will be tested  at 2.5%  (I-sided). 
 
Analysis of the co-primar y and first seconda1 y endpoints will begin with a model selection step in 
an effort to select the most parsimonious model. Two mixed effects model s, the first with a fixed 
effect for treatment and random effect for site, and the secon d with a fixed effect for treatment and 
random effects for site and treatment by [CONTACT_294148], will be fit to the first co-primai y endpoint 
(best coITected di sta nce visual acuity). The 2 model s will  be compared  using  Bayesian 
infonn ation criterion (BIC) and the model with lower BIC will be employed for analysis of all 3 
aforementioned  endpoint s. 
 
15.4.1  Primary  Performance  
The co-prim a1yeffectiveness endpoints are: 
 
• Mean photopic monocular best con ected distance visual acuity (4 m) for the fir st operative

[IP_ADDRESS]  Analysis  Methods  
Least Squares Means (LSMEANS) from the mixed effects model chosen during the model 
selection step will be employed to estimate the difference in means (AcrySof IQ PanOptix IOL 
Model TFNT00 minus AcrySof Monofocal IOL Model SN60AT) and the associated confid ence 
interval.  
 
The first secondary superiority hypothesis will be deemed supported if the upper 97.5% 
confidence limit is less than 0.0 logMAR.  
 
The above analysis will be repeated for the second eyes and will be considered supportive.  
 
The second seconda ry endpoint will be analyzed by [CONTACT_294149] -Haenszel common 
difference of proportions (AcrySof IQ PanOptix IOL Model TFNT00 minus AcrySof Monofocal 
IOL Model SN60AT) along with the corresponding confidence interval with site as a stratification 
variable. The superiority hypothesis will be deemed supported if the lower 97.5% confidence limit 
of the confidence interval exceeds 0.

The secondary safety objective is to estimate rates of severe and most bothersome (separately) 
visual disturbances as reported by [CONTACT_155697] a questionnaire (QUVID) at Month 6.  
 
The third safety objective is to eva luate rates of cumulative and persistent Adverse Events in first 
eyes at month 6 in comparison to ISO [ZIP_CODE] -7 SPE grid rates.

15.9 Adaptive Study  Design  
Not applicable.  
 
15.10  Sample Size  Justification  
Approximately 250 subjects will be bilaterally implanted with either  the AcrySof IQ PanOptix 
IOL Model TFNT00 or the AcrySof Monofocal IOL Model SN60AT in a 1:[ADDRESS_358203] group and the control group. 
This assumes a drop -out rate of 10%, appro ximately.  
 
For co -primary and first secondary effectiveness objectives, the proposed sample size will provide  
≥98% power for each of the hypotheses, with α=0.05, [ADDRESS_358204], and 
α=0.025, [ADDRESS_358205] ed visual acuity at intermediate (66 
cm) and distance corrected visual acuity at near (40 cm) and a common standard deviation of 0.[ADDRESS_358206] corrected distance visual acuity (4 m), a non -inferiority margin of 0.[ADDRESS_358207] deviation of 0.18 is based on the 
maximum variability of logMAR observed in study C -06-40 (Clinical Study Report: Clinical 
Investigation of ACRYSOF ReSTOR Aspheric +3.0 D Add Power IOL).  
 
For the second secondary effectiveness objective, the proposed sample size will provide 83% 
power, with α=0.025, [ADDRESS_358208] a difference in proportion of 20%, assuming a ≥50% rate 
in the AcrySof IQ PanOptix IOL test group. The estimates of rates of spectacle need for the test 
and control lenses are inferred from studies ILH297 -P002 and C -10-016, respectively, using a 
binocular  visual acuity threshold of 0.2 logMAR or better at near (40 c m) and 
distance (4 m) as a proxy  measure.  
 
Power calculations for the effectiveness objectives are summarized in the table below:  
 
 
 Margin  Expected  
Difference  Std. 
dev Type I error  
(1-sided)  Power  
Non- Inferiority       
BCDVA (4 m)  0.1 0.0 0.18 5% 99% 
Superiority       
DCNVA (40 cm)   0.1 0.18 2.5%  98% 
DCIVA (66 cm)   0.1 0.18 2.5%  98% 
Spectacle need   20%  2.5%  83% 
All expected differences for tests of superiority favor the test lens. Estimates for VA endpoints reported

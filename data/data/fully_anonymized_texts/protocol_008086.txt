placebo (2×placebo tablets [size- and color -matched to 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_387324]])  
Planned Duration of 
Treatment  The duration of participation for individual study subjects will be 
up to 16 weeks, consisting of a screening period of up to 4 weeks, 
an 8-week double-blind treatment period, and a safety follow-up 
period of 30 (+ 4) days (for those subjects who discontinue 
prematurely from the study or who do not enroll in the open- label 
extension study) ( Figure S –1). The end of the cl inical study will be 
when the last subject completes the la st scheduled assessment. If 
the study is terminated for any reason, subjects remaining in the study will return to standard of care. 
Study Design  This study will be conducted as a multicenter, ran domized, 
double-blind, placebo- controlled, parallel -group study in adult and 
elderly  subjects with neuropsychiatric symptoms related to 
Study: ACP -103-046  Final Version: 1.0 
Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 7  Date: [ADDRESS_485234] 3 periods: 
• Screening period (3-28 days) 
• Double-blind treatment period (8 weeks)  
• Safety follow-up period (30 [+ 4] days) 
Screening Period (3 -28 Days) 
During the screening period, adult and elderly subjects will be 
assessed for study eligibility and prohibited medications will be discontinued. Investigators should not withdraw a subject’s prohibited medication for the purpose of enrolling them into the study. Medications should be discontinued only if it is deemed clinically appropriate to do so and in consultation with the treating physician. 
Double -blind Period (8 Weeks)  
The Baseline visit (Visit 2) may occur as soon as screening procedures are completed and subject eligibility has been confirmed. At Visit 2, subjects will be randomized  in a 1:1 ratio to 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_4256] 34 mg once daily (QD) or matching placebo. It is 
recommended that the subject take the study drug at approximately 
the same time each day. Assessments will be conducted at Week 0 (Basel ine), 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8/ early termination ( ET). 
Safety Follow- up Period ( 30 Days) 
Eligible subjects who successfully complete the 8- week 
double-blind period will be eligible to enroll in an open- label 
extension study. For subjects who discontinue premature ly from 
the study or who do not enroll in the open-label extension study, a follow-up safety assessment visit should be conducted 30 (+ 4) 
days after the last dose of study drug. 
The schedule of assessments is provided in Table S –1. 
Data and Safety Monitoring Board 
An independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board will review 
safety information on a regular basis throughout the study. 
Sample Size 
Calculations A sample size  of [ADDRESS_485235] 1 adverse event ( AE) with a true incidence of 
1.0% is 0.977; the probability of observing at least 1 AE with a true i ncidence of 1.5% is 0.997; and the probability of observing at 
least 1  AE with a true incidence of 2.0 % is 0.999. 
Study: ACP -103-046  Final Version: 1.0 
Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 7  Date: [ADDRESS_485236] terminology using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activ ities. All AEs  will be listed and treatment- emergent adverse 
events (TEAEs) will be summarized by [CONTACT_6657].  
A TEAE is defined as an AE that started after the first dose of study drug and no later than [ADDRESS_485237] dose of study drug. Summaries by [CONTACT_387405]. Serious TEAEs, fatal TEAEs, and TEAEs leading to discontinuation will also be summarized.  
Secondary  Analyses 
MMSE and ESRS -A observed values and change from Baseline 
will be summarized by [CONTACT_6982]. T he change fro m 
Baseline in the MMSE and ESRS -A scores will be summarized  
using mixed model repeated measures (MMRM). T he model will 
include effects for region, treatment group, visit, treatment-by- visit 
interaction, Baseline score, and Baseline score-by- visit interaction. 
No formal comparisons between treatment groups are planned. The MMRM results for the pi[INVESTIGATOR_387325]. 
Exploratory Analyses  
For the C- SSRS, the number and percentage of subjects with 
suicidal ideation or suicid al behavior during the study will be 
tabulated.  For the GCAS, the number and percentage of subjects 
with a score of 3 or 4 during the study will be tabulated. 
The CGI -I scores and the change f rom Baseline in the CGI -S and 
SDI scores will be summarized  using MMRM. The model will 
include effects for region, treatment group, visit, treatment-by- visit 
interaction, Baseline score, and Baseline score-by- visit interaction. 
For CGI- I, the Baseline CGI -S score will be used as the Baseline 
covariate in the model. The change from Baseline in the 
EQ-5D- 5L will be summarized using an ANCOVA model with  
effects for region, treatment group, and Baseline score. No formal 
comparisons between treatment groups are planned. The MMRM

This document is a research protocol and the described study will be conducted in 
compliance with the protocol and the International Council for Harmonis ation (ICH) 
Good Clinical Practice  (GCP)  Guideline.  
1.[ADDRESS_485249] all individuals with dementia  exhibit neuropsychiatric symptoms over the 
course of the disease ( Steinberg et al. 2008; Lanctot et al. 2017), causing distress for the 
patient and their caregivers , as they are “ associated with impairment in activities of daily 
living, poor quality of li fe, earlier institutionalization, accelerated  disease progression, 
increased mortality, caregiver stress, and increased cost of care” (Lanctot  et al.  2017). 
Psychosis, apathy, agitation, depression and sleep disturbances are common neuropsychiatric 
symptoms associated with Alzheimer’s disease. The emergence of neuropsychiatric 
symptoms typi[INVESTIGATOR_387328]: “(1) irritability, depression, and nightt ime 
behavior changes; (2) anxiety, appetite changes, agitation, and apathy; and (3) elation, motor disturbances, hallucinations, delusions, and disinhibition ” (Masters  et al.  2015).  
Psychosis is a common neuropsychiatric symptom, particularly in patients with dementia 
associated with neurodegenerative disease. Psychotic symptoms are typi[INVESTIGATOR_387329]  (DLB ), very common in Alzheim er’s disease ( AD) and occur, although to a 
lesser degree, in vascular dementia (VaD)  and frontotemporal dementi a (FTD)  (Table 1 –1). 
In one study, 67% of patients with dementia  had psychotic symptoms ( Ballard  et al.  1995). It 
is also a frequent complication  of Parkinson’s disease patients, with or without dementia. The 
psychosis in neurodegenerative diseases is typi[INVESTIGATOR_387330], with delusions often consisting of the reactions or rationalizations that follow. However , delusions 
do occur as distinct phenomena, often taking the form of misinterpretations of real or imaginary objects, delusions of infidelity or abandonment, or beliefs such as thinking that spouses or relatives are duplicates of the original person. Among AD patients, delusions are 
more common than hallucinations ( Fischer et al. 2016 ; Ballard  et al. 1995) while 
hallucinatio ns are more common in patients with DLB  and Parkinson’s disease dementia. 
Patients with psychosis who had a clinical diagnosis of AD are often found on autopsy to have Lewy bodies or vascular lesions (Fischer et al. 2016; Kim  et al. 2017).

There is evidence that psychotic features in Parkinson’s disease, AD, and DLB are associated 
with polymorphisms in the serotonergic pathway genes, in particular the 5HTTLPR 
polymorphism in SLA6A4, which codes for the serotonin transporter ( Sweet et al. 2001 ; 
Quaranta et al. 2009 ; DeMichele-Sweet et al. 2010 ; Creese et al. 2014 ). This observation 
raises the possibility that there is a common biological link among those dementia patients 
who have psychotic features, regardless of subtype, and provides mechanistic support for the 
finding that pi[INVESTIGATOR_4256], a compound with serotonergic but not dopaminergic activity, can 
have an effect on delusions and hallucinations. 
Treatment of neuropsychiatric symptoms associated with neurodegenerative disease 
represents an area of high unmet need. There are no approved therapi[INVESTIGATOR_387331]. A substantial number of these patients receive off-label 
antipsychotic drug treatment to control their symptoms. However, many of these drugs have 
not demonstrated efficacy in controlled trials, worsen patients’ motor symptoms, require 
extensive monitoring, or have other safety concerns. The lack of target engagement in a 
degenerating brain may limit the effectiveness of currently approved treatments, such as 
antidepressants and antipsychotics, for mood and psychotic symptoms ( Lanctot et al. 2017 ). 
The CATIE-AD study concluded that the adverse effects of risperidone, olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], and

assessment, particularly in elderly patients with dementia. In severe cases, limited indications 
exist for some antipsychotics; however, they are restricted to short- term treatment in patients 
with severe and persistent symptoms when non- pharmacological treatments have failed, and 
when there is risk of harm to self or others. For example, risperidone is approved in Canada 
and Europe for short- term treatment of persistent aggression in moderate to severe 
Alzheimer’s disease unresponsive to non-pharmacological approaches and when there is a 
risk of harm to self or others .

The scope of the development program for pi[INVESTIGATOR_387343]. At the time of approval, 616 mostly older, late-stage PDP subjects had be en evaluated in 
16 countries over a span of >10 years. Clinically meaningful efficacy was established in Study ACP -103-020, a 6- week, placebo -controlled Phase 3 study ( Cummings et al. 20 14). 
This efficacy was supported by [CONTACT_387406]- term Ph ase 2b /[ADDRESS_485252]  subgroups, and sensitivity 
analyses. Improvements in sleep and daytime wakefulness were also observed . These clinical 
benefits were achieved without worsening of Parkinson’s disease motor symptoms and without a number of other safety concerns associated with atypi[INVESTIGATOR_16709]. 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_387344] . Across all clinical studies 
of pi[INVESTIGATOR_4256], the most frequently reported treatment- emergent adverse events ( TEAEs ) 
were in the central nervous system (CNS), gastrointestinal, and psychiatric systems. Most 
events  were mild to moderate in intensity . The most common CNS TEAEs included dizziness 
(including postural), headache, and somnolence (drowsiness). Common gastrointestinal disturbances included dyspepsia, nausea, constipation, and vomiting. Severe nausea and vomiting were dose li miting in a few cases . Reported psychiatric conditions included

Day 4 3 in the NPI-NH psychosis score (Delusions+Hallucinations domains). 
A total of 181 subjects were randomized (n=90 pi[INVESTIGATOR_387349] n=91 placebo) with 178 subjects included in the F ull Analysis Set (FAS; n=87 pi[INVESTIGATOR_387349] n=91 placebo).

• Screening  period (3-28 days) 
• Double-blind treatment period (8 weeks) 
• Safety follow-up period (30 [+ 4] days) 
If the study is terminated for any reason, subjects remaining in the study will return to standard of care.  
3.2 Screening  Period  (3-28 D ays) 
During the S creening  period, subjects will be assessed for study eligibility and prohibited 
medications will be discontinued. 
Investigators should not withdraw a subject’s prohibited medication for the purpose of 
enrolling them into the study. Medications should be discontinued only if it is deemed 
clinically appropriate to do so and in consultation with the treating physician. 
3.3 Double -blind Period  (8 We eks) 
The Baseline visit (Visit 2 ) may occur as soon as screening  procedures are completed and 
subject eligibility has been confirmed . At Visit 2, s ubjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_4256] 34 mg daily (QD) or matching placebo . It is recomme nded that the subject take 
the study drug at approximately the same time each day. Assessments will be conducted at 
Week 0 (Baseline), 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8/ early termination ( ET). 
3.4 Safety Follow- up Peri od (30 Days) 
Eligible subjects who successfully complete t he 8-week double- blind period will be eligible 
to enroll in an open-label extension study. For subjects who discontinue prematurely from the 
study or who do not enroll in the open-label extension study, a safety follow-up telephone 
call visit should
 be conducted  30 (+ 4) days after the last dose of study drug.

6 STUDY PROCEDURES  
Study specific procedures are detailed below. All assessments will be completed according to 
the schedule described in  Table S –1. Every effort should be made to complete the required 
procedures and evaluations at the designated visits and times. 6.1 Screening  Assessments 
6.1.1 Neuropsychiatric Inventory  
The NPI  [INVESTIGATOR_387380] 
(Cummings et  al. 1994). The original NPI [INVESTIGATOR_387381] 10 neuropsychiatric disturbances 
common in dementia: delusions, hallucinations, agitation, dysphoria, anxiety, apathy, 
irritability, euphoria, disinhibition, and aberrant motor behavior. Two other domains, nighttime behavior disturbances and appetite and eating abnormalities, were subsequently added to the NPI ( Cummings 1997). At Screening , the degree of the patient’s 
neuropsychiatric symptoms wil l be evaluated using several of the domains of the NPI , as 
described in Section 4.2 Inclu sion Criteria; patients with at least one  individual domain score 
(frequency  × severity ) greater than or equal to 4  at Scr eening and Baseline (the domains at 
Screening and Baseline can be different)  will be eligible for the study . 
6.1.2 Mini -Mental State Examination  
The MMSE is a brief 30 -point questionnaire that is used to quantitatively assess cognition 
(Folstein et al. 1975). The MMSE includes simple questions and problems in a number of 
areas : the time and place of testing, repeating lists of words, arithmetic, language use and 
comprehension, and copying a drawing. The MMSE is being used in this study to screen for cognitive imp airment  and as a safety measure. 
The MMSE will be assessed at all scheduled visits.  
6.1.[ADDRESS_485279]. Demographic 
information, including date of birth, gender, race, and ethnicity will be recorded as well . Any 
new medical condition beginning after the informed consent form (ICF) has been signed will

Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 7  Date: [ADDRESS_485280]’s psychiatric history and treatment will be collected.  
6.1.[ADDRESS_485281]’s dementia diagnosis and treatment will be collected , including the date 
that dementia was determined.  
6.1.[ADDRESS_485282]’s neurological diagnosis and treatment will be collected, including the 
date that any neurologic al disease was determined . 
6.1.7 Computed Tomography/Magnetic Resonance Imaging  
A CT  or MRI head  scan will be completed if the subject ha s not had brain imaging with a 
CT or MRI scan completed with in the l ast 3 year s (Section 4.2). The purpose of the scan is to 
evaluate criteria excluding a clinically significant  CNS abnormality ( Section 4.3).  
6.2 Exploratory E fficacy  Assessments 
6.2.1 Clinical Global Impression  – Severity and Improvement Scales 
The CGI –S scale is a clinician -rated, [ADDRESS_485283]’s neuropsychia tric symptoms at the time of assessment using the Investigator’s 
judgment and past experience with subjects who have the same disorder ( Guy 1976). The 
CGI-S will be assessed at Screening and at all scheduled and unscheduled visits and will be 
used for expl oratory efficacy analyses.  
The CGI -I is a clinician -rated, [ADDRESS_485284]’s neuropsychiatric symptoms at the time of assessment, relative to the symptoms at Baseline . The CGI -I will be assessed at Week s 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8/EOT and will be used for 
exploratory efficacy analyses. 
6.2.2 EQ-5D-5L 
The EQ -5D- 5L is a standardized instrument used as a measure of health outcome 
(Kind  1996). It measures 5 dimensions (mobility, self -care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, 
anxiety/depression) each of which has [ADDRESS_485285] 5 levels of 
severity (no problems/slight problems/moderate problems/severe problems/extreme 
problems) within a particular EQ -5D dimension. The EQ -5D-5L Proxy version 1 will be 
used. For this version, a caregiver (the proxy) is asked to rate the subject’s health -related

The SDI is an expanded version of one item of the NPI ( Tractenberg et al. 2003). It consists 
of the [ADDRESS_485286] to a single rating for frequency and severity for all sleep disturbance- related 
behaviors, which would be incorporat ed into an overall NPI [INVESTIGATOR_32005], the SDI score is derived 
after the caregiver rates the frequency and severity of each of the 7  separate sleep disturbance 
symptoms. Caregiver distress ratings are not part of the SDI total score, but distress is 
measured.  The SDI total score is calculated  as the average of seven frequency 
ratings × average of seven severity ratings, with a range of 0-12. The SDI will be assessed at 
Weeks 0, 4, and 8/EOT and will be used for exploratory efficacy analyses.

6.3.4 Electroca rdiograms 
All 12 -lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) will be complete, standardized recordings. Triplicate 
ECGs will be completed at Visit 1 ( Screening) and a single recording will be completed at all 
other times . All ECGs will be centrally read; the interpretation by [CONTACT_387419].

 Confidential and Proprietary Information of Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 48 of 92 At Visit 1 (Screening) the mean QTcF/QRS values of all the tracings of adequate quality will 
be used to determine eligibility.  If a site performs additional ECGs beyond the set of triplicate 
ECGs prescribed at Screening or the single ECG prescribed at Baseline, the mean QTcF/QRS values of all t he tracings of adequate quality will be used to determine eligibility.  
• At Screening, if the set of triplicate ECGs has a prolonged QTcF due to an identifiable 
cause, and it is medically appropriate to address that cause, a repeat set of triplicate 
ECGs may  be performed during Screening at the discretion of the Medical Monitor 
• At Baseline, a subject may be enrolled based on the machine read of t he locally 
completed ECG. If the interpretation of the ECG by [CONTACT_387420], the subject will be discontinued from the study, but this will not be considered a protocol deviation. 
The subject must rest in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_387382]. ECG tracings (paper or electronic) will be reviewed and interpr eted by a qualified clinician. ECG tracings and results 
(heart  rate, RR, PR, QRS, QT, QTcF , and QTcB interval  duration) will be included  and 
summarized in the subject's study records. 
6.3.5 Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale  
The C -SSRS monitors changes in suicidal thinking and behavior over time, in order to 
determine risk ( Posner et al. 2011). The following four constructs are measured: the seve rity 
of ideation, the intensity of ideation, behavior, and lethality. The C -SSRS will be used to assess suicidal id eations and behaviors in subjects who are able 
to complete the assessment (subjects without dementia, defined as an MMSE ≥25, and 
subjects wi th dementia who the Investigator has determined can complete the C- SSRS). 
Whether or not the subject can complete the C -SSRS should be documented for each subject. 
For subjects who are able to complete the assessment, the Baseline/ Screening version will be 
administered at Visit 1 ( Screening), and the Since Last Visit version will be administered at 
subsequent visits. T he C-SSRS results for each subject should be reviewed by [CONTACT_387421]. If at any time the C -SSRS results for a given subject reveal 
potential suicidality, then the Investigator should assess the clinical significance of such results. If a  clinically significant risk of suicidality is identified for a subject, then the 
Investigator should discontinue the subject and implement appropriate treatment 
(Section  4.4).

partner/caregiver rating, and a clinician rating . 
If the subject is not able to reliably complete the C -SSRS in the Investigator’s judgment, the 
GCAS will be administered  and used thereafter in the study . If the GCAS is administered, at

6.3.7 Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale- Abbreviated  
The ESRS ( Chouinard and Margolese 2005 ) was developed to assess drug induced 
movement disorders such as parkinsonism, akathisia, dystonia and tardive dyskinesia with established reliability, validity , and  sensitivity. It consists of a questionnaire of parkinsonian 
symptoms, physician examination of parkinsonism, dyskinetic movements, and global impression of tardive dyskinesia. The ESRS-A, an accepted modified form of the original 
ESRS,  will be used during the study to monitor for any worsening in extrapyramidal  
symptoms or signs at scheduled and unscheduled visits.

7 ADVERSE EVENTS  
7.1 Specification of Safety Parameters  
7.1.1 Definition of Adverse Event  
An AE is defined as “any untoward medical occurrence asso ciated w ith the use of a drug in 
humans, whether or not considered drug related” ( US FDA  2012). 
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g., an abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, wit hout any 
judgment about causality or seriousness. An AE can arise from any use of the drug (e.g., off -label use, use in combination with another drug) and from any route of 
administration, formulation, or dose, including an overdose. 
A suspected adverse reaction is any AE  for which there is a reasonable possibility that the 
drug caused the AE . 
AEs do not include the following: 
• Stable or intermittent chronic conditions (such as myopia requiring eyeglasses) that 
are present prior to Baseline and do not worsen during the study 
• Medical or surgical procedures (e.g., surgery, endoscopy, tooth extraction, 
transfusion). The condition that leads to the procedure is an AE if not present at Baseline 
• Overdose of concomitant medication without any signs or symptoms  unless the 
subject is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_115913] 
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_120004] (situation where an untoward medical occurrence has not occurred)  
Study: ACP -103-046   Final Versio n: 1.0  
Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 7  Date: 5 March  2021  
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 53 of 92 • Pregnancy will not be considered an AE, but if it occurs, it will be reported on a 
pregnancy form  
Adverse events will be recorded from the time informed consent is obtained through the duration of the study. 
All AEs must be either resolved or stable at end of study. If ongoing at the end of the study 
the subject should be referr ed for appropriate treatment.  
For subjects who enroll into an open-label extension study, AEs will be recorded from the time informed consent is obtained in the present study until the first dose of study drug in the open-label study. 
For subjects who discontinue from the study or do not enroll into the open-label extension, 
AEs will be recorded from the time informed consent is obtained until [ADDRESS_485291] 
dose of study drug. 
7.1.2 Definition of Serious Adverse Event  
In addition to the severity rating, each AE will be classified by [CONTACT_5256] “serious” 
or “not serious.” The seriousness of an event will be defined according to the applicable 
regulations and generally refers to the outcome of an event. An SAE is one that meets one or more of the following: 
• Is fatal  
• Is immediately life threatening  
• Results in disability or permanent damage  
• Requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
• Prolongs existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] 
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect (in an offspring) 
• Is medically significant  
Definition of Life Threatening  
A life threatening event places the subject at immediate  risk of death from the event as it 
occurred. This does not include an AE, which, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death. 
Definition of Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_387384] n is defined as a full admission to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_387385]. 
This includes prolongation of an existing inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
Study: ACP -103-046   Final Versio n: 1.0  
Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 7  Date: 5 March  2021  
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 54 of 92 Examples of visits to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_387386]: 
• Emergency room visits (that do not result in a full hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063]) 
• Outpatient surgery 
• Preplanned or elective procedures  
• Protocol procedures 
• Social hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], defined as admission to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1315] a result of inadequate family support or ca re at the subject’s primary residence  
Definition of Disability or Permanent Damage 
Disability is defined as a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the 
ability to conduct normal life functions. 
Definition of Medically Significa nt 
Important medical events (medically significant events) that may not result in death, be life 
threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_149693], based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject or may requ ire medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of 
such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias, or convulsions that do not result in  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_149694]. 
An SAE may also include any other event that the Investigator or Medical Monitor judges to 
be serious or that suggests a significant hazard, contraindication, side effect, or precaution. 
7.2 Classification of an Adverse Event 
7.2.1 Severity of Event  
The severity of each AE will be graded on a 3- point scale and reported in detail as indicated on 
the eCRF:  
• Mild : awareness of sign or symptom but easily tolerated, causing minimal discomfort, 
and not interfering with normal everyday activities  
• Moderate: sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal everyday activities  
• Severe: incapacitating and/or preventing normal everyday activities 
7.2.2 Relationship to Study Drug  
The causality of each AE should be assessed and classified by [CONTACT_5256] “related” or 
“not related.” An event is considered related if there is a reasonable possibility that the event 
Study: ACP -103-046   Final Versio n: 1.0  
Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 7  Date: [ADDRESS_485292] under investigation (i.e., there are facts, evidence, or 
arguments to suggest possible causation). 
Consider the following when assessing causality: 
• Temporal associations between the agent and the event  
• Response to cessation (de- challenge) or re-challenge 
• Compatibility with known class effect 
• Known effects of co ncomitant medications  
• Pre-existing risk factors 
• A plausible mechanism  
• Concurrent illnesses 
[IP_ADDRESS] Duration 
The start and stop dates for AEs will be recorded using the following criteria: 
• Start : Date of the first epi[INVESTIGATOR_149688]  
• Stop : Date when AE either ceased permanently or changed in severity  
[IP_ADDRESS] Frequency  
The frequency of the AE should be indicated according to the following definitions: 
• Single : Experienced once, without recurrence 
• Recurrent : More than one di screte epis ode with the same severity  
[IP_ADDRESS] Action Taken with Study Drug  
• Dose not changed : No change in study drug 
• Drug interrupted : Study drug temporarily stopped 
• Drug withdrawn : Study drug discontinued permanently 
[IP_ADDRESS] Therapy  
• None : No new treatment instituted  
• Medication : New  treatment initiated as a direct result of AE  
• Other: Other action required  
[IP_ADDRESS] Outcome 
• Recovered/resolved : Recovered or resolved  
• Recovered/resolved with sequelae: Recovered or resolved with sequelae

different since your last visit?”) to assess whether any AEs have been experienced since the 
last report or visit.  
Note that any use of medication (and specifically any newly prescribed medication) during 
the course of a study may indicate the occurrence of an AE that may need to be recorded on 
both the AE and the concomitant medication page.  
All AEs  will be coded by [CONTACT_387423] (MedD RA).  
All AEs, serious and not serious, will be recorded on the AE eCRF page using appropriate 
medical terminology. Severity and relationship to study drug will be assessed by [CONTACT_3786]. 
When possible, clinical AEs should be described by [CONTACT_149724] 
(e.g., “cold” or “s easonal allergies” instead of “runny nose”). 
All AEs, whether or not related to the study drug, must be fully and completely documented 
on the AE eCRF and in the subject’s notes.

use the appropriate form for initial and/or follow-up reporting. 
At a minimum, events identified by [CONTACT_387424], 
unexpected, and related to study drug must be brought to the attention of the responsible IRB/EC, as per applicable regulations . These wi ll be provided by [CONTACT_387425]. For European Union member states, the Sponsor or its designee will provide 
reports of suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) directly to the ECs, as 
required by [CONTACT_19666]. In all other countries, it is the Investigator’s responsibility to provide these expedited reports to the responsible IRB/EC. It is also the Investigator’s responsibility to  notify the responsible IRB/EC regarding any new and significant safety 
information.  
For this study, sites will complete the paper SAE  form (for initial and/or follow-up 
information) including available supporting documentation relevant to the event and fax or 
email (within 24 hours of discovery) to the contact [CONTACT_387426].  
Subjects will be followed until EO T/ET for any SAEs and/or other reportable information or 
until such events have resolved or the Investigator, in conjunction w ith the Sponsor , deems 
them to be chronic or stable.  
In the event of any SAE (other than death), the study subject will be instructed to contact [CONTACT_737] (or designee) using the telephone number provided in the ICF. All subjects experiencing an SAE will be seen by [CONTACT_387427]. 
Serious AEs occurring after the study Follow-up Period should be reported if in the judgment 
of the Investigator there is “a reasonable possibility” that the event may have been caused by [CONTACT_77425].   
SAEs should also be reported to the IRB/EC according to local regulations.

9.8 Breaking the Study Blind/Subject Code  
For the final analysis, the treatment codes for all subjects will be released to the Sponsor after 
all subjects have completed the study and the clinical database is locked.  
For DSMB safety reviews, the treatment codes will be released to an independent statistician/programmer to produce unblinded statistical outputs. The Sponsor and the Investigators will remain blinded.  
One or more unblinded interim analyses of data from subjects who have exited the study 
(i.e., completed, enrolled into the open- label extension , or terminated early) may  be 
conducted ( Section 9.5.5), and unblinding of the Sponsor to individual treatment assignment 
as part of such analysis is permitted. 
Other than in the situations described above, unblinding of individual treat ment assignment 
during the study is discouraged. The Investigator may break the blind in the event of a

10.6 Protocol Exceptions and Deviations 
No prospective entry criteria protocol deviations are allowed; all subjects must meet all 
eligibility criteria in order  to participate in the study.  
Protocol waivers for eligibility will not be granted by [CONTACT_387435]. 
If, during the course of a subject’s post- randomization participation in the trial it is 
discovered that the subject did not meet  all eligibility criteria, he or she will be discontinued, 
unless the discontinuation presents an unacceptable medical risk. The justification to allow 
the subject to continue in the trial will be made by [CONTACT_1034], with medical input from the Investigator, and will be documented. If allowed to remain in the trial, this will be reported as 
a major protocol deviation and not a waiver . All follow -up safety assessments must be 
completed and documented as outlined in the protocol ( Section  6.4). The Investigator must 
report any protocol deviation to the Sponsor and, if required, to the IRB/EC in accordance 
with local regulations, within reasonable ti me. 
10.7 Protocol Amendments  
Changes to the protocol may be made only by [CONTACT_1034] (with or without consultation with 
the Investigator) . All protocol modifications must be submitted to the site IRB/EC in 
accordance with local requirements and, if required, to regulatory authorities , as either an 
amendment or a noti fication . Approval for amendments must be awaited before any changes 
can be implemented, except for changes necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard to trial 
subjects, or when the changes involve only logistical or administrative aspects of the trial. 
No approval is required for notifications. 
11 QUALITY MANAGEMENT  
11.1 Risk Management  
The Sponsor utilizes the ICH E6 (GCP) Revision 2 risk management approach that includes methods to assure and control the quality of the trial proportionate to the risks inherent in the trial and the importance of the information collected. The intent is that all aspects of this trial are operationally feasible and that any unnecessary complexity, procedures, and data 
collection are avoided. The Sponsor’s risk management approach includes the following 
activities with a focus on critical processes and critical study data:  
• Risk Identification: identification of risks to critical study processes, governing 
systems, i nvestigational product, study design, data collection, and recording.

Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 7  Date: 5 March  2021  
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 64 of 92 • Risk Evaluation: identified risks are evaluated by [CONTACT_387436]: 
(a) likelihood of error occurrence, (b) impact on human subject protection and data 
integrity, and ( c) detectability of errors.  
• Risk Control: risks that can be reduced (e .g., mitigating) or can be accepted are 
differentiated. Risk mitigation activities are incorporated in protocol design and implementation, study plans, training, processes, and other documents governing the oversight and execution of study activities. Where possible, predefined quality tolerance limits are to be defined to identify systematic issues that can impact subject 
safety or data integrity and deviations from the predefined qualit y tolerance limits will 
trigger an evaluation and possibly an action. Contingency plans are developed for 
issues with a high risk factor that cannot be avoided. 
• Periodic Risk Review, communication and escalation of Risk Management activities 
during trial execution and risk outcome reporting in the Clinical Study Report (CSR).

inspecting the various records of the trial (e.g., eCRFs and other pertinent data) provided that 
subject confidentiality is respected.  
The Sponsor’s or designee’s monitor is responsible for inspecting the eCRFs at regular intervals throughout the study to verify adherence to the protoc ol; completeness, accuracy, 
and consistency of the data; and adherence to local regulations on the conduct of clinical research . The monitor should have access to subject medical records and other study- related 
records needed to verify the entries on the e CRFs.  
The Investigator agrees to cooperate with the monitor to ensure that any problems detected in 
the course of these monitoring visits are resolved. 
In accordance with ICH Guidance on  GCP and the Sponsor’s audit plans, a certain percentage 
of sites part icipating in this study will be audited . These audits may include a review of site 
facilities (e.g., pharmacy, drug storage areas, and laboratories) and review of study- related 
records may occur in order to evaluate the trial conduct and compliance with th e protocol, 
ICH Guidance on GCP, and applicable regulatory requirements. The Sponsor’s or designee’s representatives, regulatory authority inspectors and IRB/EC 
representatives who obtain direct access to source documents should also respect subject 
confidentiality, taking all reasonable precautions in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements to maintain the confidentiality of subjects’ identities.

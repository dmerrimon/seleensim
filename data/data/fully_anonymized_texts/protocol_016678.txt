Page 7 of 28 1. INTRODUCTION 
The Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) describes the data analysis  specifications for Xencor, Inc. 
protocol XmAb5871-03 titled: “ An Open-label, Single-arm Pi[INVESTIGATOR_465863]®5871 on Disease Activity in Patients with IgG4-Related Disease ”. It details the 
inferential statistical methodol ogy to be used in analyzing stu dy data and outlines the 
statistical programming specifi cations, tables, figures, and li stings. It describes the variables 
and populations, anticipated data t ransformations and manipulat ions, and other de tails of the 
analyses not provided in the clinical study protocol. Additiona l purposes of the SAP are to 
serve as a communication tool betw een Vantage Data Designs, Inc . and Xencor, Inc.with 
respect to expected statistical  data outputs after database loc k and to allow SAS 
programming of the tables, listin gs, figures to commence as ear ly in the process as possible. 
This version of the statistical  analysis plan was prepared in a ccordance with the protocol 
XmAb5871-03 Version 3 Amendme nt 2, dated January 31, 2017. Othe r related documents 
are the electronic case report forms (eCRFs), Medidata RAVE Scr een Shots DEV Draft v3.1, 
and Medidata RAVE System Data S pecifications (SDS) document dat ed 30NOV2015. This 
SAP supersedes the statistical  considerations identified in the  protocol. The SAP will be 
finalized prior to database lock a nd describes the statistical analysis as it is foreseen when the 
study is being planned. If circum stances should arise during th e study rendering this analysis 
inappropriate, or if in the meanti me improved methods of analys is should come to light, 
different analyses may be made. A ny deviations from the SAP aft er database lock, including 
alternative or additi onal statistical anal yses that may be perf ormed, will be described in the 
clinical study report.  
2. OVERVIEW OF STUDY DESIGN 
Experimental Design: Phase 2, multi-center, non-randomized, ope n-label, pi[INVESTIGATOR_465864]4-Related Disease (IgG4-RD). 
Allocation of treatment: singl e agent (XmAb5871) – no randomiza tion. There are two 
cohorts for this study: 5 mg/ kg (first 15 subjects), fixed 90 m g or 180 mg (up to 6 additional 
subjects). 
Number of patients planned: a  total of up to 21 patients will b e enrolled at at the 
[LOCATION_005] General Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] ([LOCATION_011], MA) and up to [ADDRESS_597291] to follow up or w ithdraw consent  for study partici pation prior to 
study drug administration may be replaced, at sponsor’s discret ion.

Confidential/Proprietary Property of Xencor, Inc.  
Page 8 of 28 Treatment and Study Duration: A fter a screening period of up to  28-days, eligible patients 
will receive XmAb5871 IV every ot her week for a total of up to 12 doses (22 weeks).  
Patients will be followed on study for [ADDRESS_597292] dose for a total study period 
of up to 32 weeks.  
Dose and Route of Administration:  Every other week administrati on of XmAb5871 at 5.0 
mg/kg by [CONTACT_12781] 1-[ADDRESS_597293] 15 patients, then up to 6 patients treated 
with either 90 mg fixed dose or 180 mg fixed dose by [CONTACT_113925] n every other week. 
Study Procedures: After obtaining i nformed consent, all screeni ng procedures and tests 
establishing eligibility will be  performed within a period of 2 8 days before dosing.  Patients 
determined to be eligible at scr eening will return to the study  site on study Day 1 at which 
time baseline procedures and tes ts will be performed.  Followin g baseline assessments, 
patients will be administered X mAb5871 as an IV infusion over a  2 hour infusion period at a 
dose of 5 mg/kg.  Patients will be observed for at least [ADDRESS_597294] administration during which time safety assessments will be performed.   
All patients will return to the study site on Day 8 for safety,  PK and PD assessments.  
Patients will return on study Days 15, 29, 43, 57, 71, 85, 99, 113, 127, 141 and 155 for 
XmAb5871 (5 mg/kg) administra tion over a 1-[ADDRESS_597295] Day 197/EOS.  
Safety, PK, PD and disease response assessments will be collect ed on both Day 169 and Day 
197/EOS.  Patient participation w ill be considered complete onc e EOS study procedures have 
been performed.  All AE(s) (including serious AEs and deaths) a nd use of concomitant 
medication information will be collected throughout the study f rom screening through the 
EOS visit.  Patients developi[INVESTIGATOR_056]-emergent AEs or clini cally significant safety lab 
abnormalities will be followed until resolution or until stabil ization of the AEs/abnormalities. 
Based on preliminary data in this  study showing reduction of Ig G4-RD disease activity 
following treatment with XmAb587 1 at 5 mg/kg every 2 weeks and based on data from a 
previous study in patients with ac tive rheumatoid arthritis sug gesting disease response 
activity at doses as low as 0.3 m g/kg, the study has been amend ed in this prot ocol version in 
order to explore the treatment effect of lower doses of XmAb587 1. Following enrollment of 
the first 15 patients (treated a t 5 mg/kg every other week), ap proximately 3 additional 
patients will be treated wit h a fixed dose of 90 mg of XmAb5871  given IV every other week.

XmAb5871. These up to 6 additional  patients will be pooled as a  second cohort (“Fixed 
Dose”). At the discretion of t he Investigator and Sponsor, pati ents dosed at [ADDRESS_597296] their dose incr eased to 180 mg if there has b een an inadequate clinical 
response to therapy. All study proce dures will remain the same for these patients except for 
the administration of a lower  dosage of XmAb5871. The dose for the 90 and 180 mg dose 
patients will be administered ove r a 1 hour period at a constan t rate. 
Schedule of Assessments: The st udy consists of a Screening visi t (Day -28 to Day -1) 
followed by [CONTACT_465871]5871 given every two weeks (Days 1, 15, 29, 43, 57, 
71, 85, 99, 113, 127, 141 and 155) with collection of safety, P K, and PD.  Patients will be 
seen on Day 8 for safety monitoring, PK and PD and will be foll owed for 6 weeks after the 
final infusion (Days 169 and 197[EOS]).  The maximal study dura tion for an individual 
patient will be [ADDRESS_597297] infusion.  See Section  13 of this statistical analysis plan 
for more details.

has discontinued or completed the study.  
The definitions of AE terms are guided by [CONTACT_465872] e of Federal Regulations (21 
CFR 312.32) and are included i n Section [IP_ADDRESS] of the study pr otocol. Please use the study 
protocol if further information is needed.  
Treatment Emergent Adverse Event (TEAE) 
Adverse medical events occurring a fter the Date of Informed Con sent but before the first 
dose of study drug will be recorded on the Medical History form . Therefore, all AEs captured 
on AE dataset are considered “trea tment-emergent” adverse event s (TEAEs).

7. MISSING DATA AND DROPOUTS 
The issue of how to handle mi ssing data caused by [CONTACT_465873] c linical studies is a research 
topic that is still under devel opment in the statistical litera ture. As has bee n noted in the ICH-
E9 guideline, “no universally applicable method of handling mis sing values can be 
Xencor, Inc.   Statistical Analysis Plan 
Protocol: XmAb5871-03  Version: 1.0 (Dated 20NOV2017) 
 
Confidential/Proprietary Property of Xencor, Inc.  
Page 14 of 28 recommended”. The best approach is to minimize the chance of dr opouts at the design stage 
of the clinical study and during study monitoring.  
In general, data will be analyze d as received from the clinical  database. Hence, missing 
values will not be imputed excep t for the following situations:  
7.1 Partial/Missing Dates for Study -Related Visits or Procedures: 
It is anticipated that all study -related visit and procedure da tes entered into the clinical study 
database will be complete (i.e . day, month, year are all record ed) and accurate. Any missing 
or partially missing date of thi s type will be queried before s tatistical analyses are performed. 
If the day, month, and/or year a re still unknown, then the date s will be imputed as follows for 
purposes of analysis: 
  If the day of the visit or p rocedure date is missing, then tak e the previous visit and 
add the number of days to the next  visit accordin g to the visit  schedule.  
  If the month of the visit or pr ocedure date is missing then ta ke the previous visit and 
add the number of months to the n ext visit according to the vis it schedule. 
  If the year of the visit or p rocedure date is missing, then th e year will be  queried. If 
the very unlikely event that the year is unknown, no imputation  of year will take 
place.  
 Imputed dates will be noted in the patient data listings.   
7.2 Partial/Missing Dates for Adverse Events 
Adverse events with incomplete start dates will be considered t reatment-emergent adverse 
events (TEAEs), if: 
 Onset time is missing but the  onset date is on Study Day 1; 
 Day and month are missing and the y ear is equal to or after the  year of the first date 
of study drug dosing; 
 Day is missing and the year is afte r the year of the first date  of study drug dosing; 
 Day is missing and the year is equa l to the year of the first d ate of study drug dosing 
and the month is equal to or aft er the month of the first date of study drug dosing; or 
 Year is missing.

Page 15 of 28 8. DESCRIPTION OF STATISTICAL ANALYSES 
8.1 General Principles 
Unless otherwise noted, data wil l be summarized in tabular form at using summary tables and 
data listings grouped by [CONTACT_465874]5871 5 mg/kg versus XmAb5871 Fixed  Dose (i.e. 90 mg or 
180 mg). Data summaries will onl y include patients that receive  study drug. All study data 
documented on the eCRFs will be included in the study data list ings. 
Given this is a Phase 2 single- agent, open-label study without a control arm, no formal 
testing for confirmatory purposes  planned; however, if any stat istical tests are  utilized they 
will be two-sided, with type 1 erro r rate of 5%, unless otherwi se noted.  All confidence 
intervals (if constr ucted) will be constru cted at the 95% confi dence level, unless otherwise 
noted. Any inferential st atistical tests performed for this stu dy are considere d exploratory in 
nature; therefore, no p-value adjustments for multiplicity anal yses will be made. 
Data will be summarized with res pect to enrollment and disposit ion summaries, 
demographics and baseline characteristics, concomitant medicati ons, efficacy, and safety 
measures. Summary (i.e. descrip tive) statistics will include N,  mean, standard deviation, 
median, range (minimum, maximum ) values for continuous variable s and frequencies, and 
percentages for categorical variables.  Time-to-event analyses will be summarized using 
Kaplan-Meier survival analysis a nd graphs for the estimated med ian time. 
Missing or invalid data will be generally treated as missing, n ot imputed, unless otherwise 
stated (see Section 7).  
8.2 Patient Enrollment, Disposition, Protocol Deviations  
 Patient enrollment by [CONTACT_465875] w ith number of patients evalua ble for safety and 
number of patients evaluable fo r efficacy will be tabulated.  
 The number of patients completi ng the study and number withdraw ing the study with 
the primary reason for withdrawal (AE, physician recommendation , withdrew 
consent, lost to follow-up, or ot her reasons) will be tabulated . 
 A protocol deviation is any noncom pliance with the clinical tri al protocol or Good 
Clinical Practice (GCP). The  noncompliance may be either on the  part of the patient, 
the investigator, or the study s ite staff. Since protocol devia tions are not part of the 
eCRF database, they will be ide ntified and documented by [CONTACT_465876]/project manager base d on a review of data listings pri or to database lock. 
The number and percentage of patie nts with any protocol deviati ons will be tabulated.

A summary of age, gender, race , ethnicity, height, weight, and BMI will be presented using 
appropriate descriptive statistics. 
The categorical (discrete) vari ables will be summarized using c ounts and percentages. The 
continuous variables will be sum marized using mean, median, sta ndard deviation, and range 
(maximum, minimum). These summa ries will include patients in th e Safety population. 
8.4 Baseline Characteristics 
A summary of various patient base line characteristics such as: time from onset of 
signs/symptoms, time from last remission, serum IgG4 levels, hi stologies, IgG4 
characteristics (i.e., positive s taining, plasmablasts, plasmab lasts ratio), received prior 
systemic therapy for IgG4 relat ed disease (yes, no), type(s) of  prior therapy, and best 
response to prior therapy will be displayed using appropriate d escriptive statistics.  
The categorical (discrete) vari ables will be summarized using c ounts and percentages. The 
continuous variables will be sum marized using mean, median, sta ndard deviation, and range 
(maximum, minimum). These summa ries will include patients in th e Safety population. 
8.5 Physical Examination and Medical History/Concurrent Illness  
All Physical Exam and Medical Hi story/Concurrent Illnesses data  will be presented in patient 
listings. 
8.6 Prior and Concomitant Therapy  
All medications taken within 30 da ys prior to screening will be  listed as prior medications in 
patient listings. All medications taken since the time of dosin g until the end of the study will 
be classified as concomitant medications. These medications wil l be coded using WHO Drug 
Dictionary (WHO DD), versi on September 2015.  The number and pr oportion of patients in

[IP_ADDRESS]  Duration of Response and Loss of Response 
Definitions include: 
 Loss of response: Defined as a ny patient with an initial respon se who subsequently 
reports an RI increase of ≥2 point s from the previous visit.  
 Loss of response time (for patients with loss of response): Day s from date of first RI 
response to the date of  loss of response. 
 Follow-up time (for censored patients): Days from date of first  RI response to date of 
last assessment (i.e. last assessment date – date of first resp onse + 1). 
 Duration of Response (Follow-up time – Overall): Estimated dist ribution of the time 
from initial RI response to loss of response, accounting for ce nsoring using the 
Kaplan-Meier method. 
The number of patients with loss of response will be presented as frequency counts and 
percentages. Loss of response time and follow-up time will be s ummarized using descriptive 
statistics (N, mean, standard devi ation, median, minimum/maximu m).  
Duration of response will be summarized using Kaplan-Meier meth ods. The summary 
statistics (N, minimum, Kaplan-Meier median, maximum, number ce nsored) will be 
displayed to characterize duration of improvement.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Disease Activity Combination Assessment (IgG4-RD-RI, No Glucoco rticoid, No Disease 
Flare) Assessment

2) no glucocorticoid use between Day 57 and Day 169, 
3) no disease flares during the st udy.  Disease flare is define d as increase in the IgG4-
RD RI of ≥ 2 and/or the  need for increase in steroids or instit ution of additional 
therapy for IgG4-RD.   
The number of patients meeting all three of the criteria listed  above will be presented as 
frequency counts and percentages . The Clopper Pearson exact 95%  two-sided confidence 
interval will be constructed a round the estimated proportion of  patients who achieve a

Verbatim terms of TEAEs will be  mapped to preferred terms and r elated system organ 
classes (SOC) using the Medical  Dictionary for Regulatory Activ ities (MedDRA) version 
18.0. 
Tables will summarize the numbe r and percentage of patients hav ing a TEAE in each system 
organ class and preferred term. Fur ther tables will summarize t he number and percentage of 
patients having TEAE, classified a ccording to event intensity ( severity graded 1-5 according 
to CTCAE v4.03) and the number a nd percentage of patients with”  related” events.  
‘Related’ includes events where the relati onship to the study drug was reported as 
‘Possibly Related’, ‘Probabl y Related’, and ‘Definitively Related’ or where the 
relationship was not reported on the CRF.  
‘Not Related’ are events reported as ‘N ot Related ‘and ‘Unlikely Related’ on the 
CRF. 
The order of SOCs presented in t ables will be according to the internationally agreed order of 
SOCs according to MedDRA. Withi n each SOC, the preferred terms will be shown in

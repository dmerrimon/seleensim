   vi ABSTRACT Context:  Health care for children with ADHD is fragmented between patients and families, teachers, and clinicians. This fragmentation can result in poorly coordinated services, and suboptimal outcomes for children with this common mental health disorder. Little attention has been devoted to developi[INVESTIGATOR_569415] a means to improve ADHD care. Objectives:  1. Determine the comparative effectiveness of an electronic patient portal (usual care, see Appendix 1), with the electronic patient portal combined with a care manager (CM, Appendix 2) to facilitate family-centered communication and treatment for children with ADHD.  2. Assess treatment initiation, adherence and family engagement as mediators of intervention treatment effects. 3. Geocode and conduct spatial analysis to explore individual, family and community factors that moderate intervention treatment effects.  Study Design:  This study is a prospective, randomized comparative effectiveness trial. Setting/Participants: This study will enroll 300 parent-child dyads in which the child has ADHD and is 5 through 12 years old from up to 15 outpatient pediatric primary care clinics in The Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6684] (CHOP)’s Care Network. Eligible children must have an ADHD diagnosis and receive care at a participating clinic within the past 12 months. Children will be excluded if they and/or their parents/caregivers are non-English speaking, have a diagnosis of autistic spectrum disorder, conduct disorder, psychosis, bipolar disorder, or suicide attempt in the past 12 months. Participants will be randomized to either the patient portal only, or the patient portal combined with a Care Manger (CM) and will complete 3 follow-up visits over 9-12 months. Study Interventions and Measures:  Families enrolled in the intervention will receive The ADHD portal and a CM. Participants will complete a screening to determine their treatment preferences and goals, and will be contact[CONTACT_569424] 3 months by [CONTACT_8888], who will provide education on common ADHD problems, assess treatment use, and identify new concerns. The CM will also communicate with their pediatric clinicians, mental health providers, and teachers to clarify family treatment preferences and goals, communicate information, coordinate care, and address emerging treatment issues.  Families enrolled in the usual care arm will receive care as usual from their PCP and access the ADHD portal to complete rating scales, view teacher rating scales, and download 
       
   vii educational handouts. Primary study outcome measures are: Vanderbilt Parent and Teacher Rating Scales to measure ADHD Symptoms, ADHD Preference and Goal Instrument, Goal Attainment Scale, and Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System short forms and Healthy Pathway Scales to measure patient-reported outcomes. Secondary outcome assessments will include measure patient and family engagement and treatment initiation and adherence. These measures will be completed at baseline, 3-5 months, 6-8 months, and 9-12 months following enrollment.
       
   viii PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS Study Title Communication to Improve Shared-Decision Making in Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) Funder Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) Clinical Phase Phase III Study Rationale Fragmentation in health care and poor communication across systems adversely impact engagement and adherence to treatment by [CONTACT_569425]. Fragmentation of services for ADHD impairs communication and collaboration between families and primary care providers, mental health providers, and educators, and leads to suboptimal outcomes for children.  Fragmentation in the systems of care has been cited by a presidential commission as a major obstacle to effective care. To obtain treatment from diverse providers, families of affected children must negotiate the physical, mental health, and educational systems, but fragmentation in the system limits their ability to complete this task. Prior studies have documented that little communication and coordination exist among providers across different systems despi[INVESTIGATOR_569416].  Fragmentation in communication between providers has the potential to impair shared decision-making. To promote shared decision-making, we have developed an electronic health record (EHR)-linked portal to collect information from parents, teachers and clinicians on children’s ADHD symptoms and treatment-related preferences and goals. We have also developed an ADHD care manager intervention manual. Study Objective(s) Primary  • Determine the comparative effectiveness of an electronic patient portal designed to communicate family-centered preferences and goals for treatment of ADHD with providers and educators (tier 1) with the electronic patient portal combined with a Care Manger (CM)(tier 2) to facilitate communication for children with ADHD.

   [ADDRESS_746576] the potential to overcome fragmentation, promote SDM, and improve patient outcomes (Yamin, Emani, Williams, et al., 2011; North et. al., 2011). Clinicians and families are interested in having families manage their own health information within electronic systems, (Wynia, Torres & Lemieux, 2011; Markle Foundation, 2011a; Markle Foundation, 2011b) and electronic communication is common (Mariano, 2000; Rosen & Kwoh, 2007). One pediatric study in ADHD found that community pediatricians using a portal were significantly more likely to collect information from parents and teachers.83 In family medicine, use of a portal focused on preventive care resulted in increased patient activation and greater patient-centered care, and users were more likely to receive needed preventive care (Nagykaldi, Aspy, Chou & Mold, 2012).  Although the research linking portal use to patient engagement and adherence is promising, portals traditionally have been designed for simple tasks such as appointment scheduling and results review, not facilitating SDM and coordinating care around families’ clearly defined preferences and goals, a broadly applicable innovation in this proposal. To address this gap, we have developed an electronic health record (EHR)-linked portal with separate funding in order to collect information from parents and teachers on children’s ADHD symptoms, symptoms suggestive of common comorbidities, as well as parents’ treatment-related preferences and goals (Bell, Grundmeier & Localio, et al., 2010). 1.[ADDRESS_746577] developed in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_271907]-reported task completion of each intervention component by [CONTACT_8888] (0- not completed, 1- partially completed, 2- fully completed). In addition, the CM will summarize clinically relevant encounters in the ADHD portal, facilitating communication.  1.3 Relevant Literature and Data ADHD, characterized by [CONTACT_569428], impulsivity, and hyperactivity (Guevara & Stein, 2001a; Guevara & Stein, 2001b; Elia, Ambrosini & Rapoport, 1999; American Psychiatric Association, 2008) is the most common chronic neurobehavioral disorder in children (Kelleher, McInerny, Gardner, Childs & Wasserman, 2000; Green, Wong, Atkins, Taylor & 
   
   2 Feinleib, 1999). According to the National Survey of Children’s Health conducted by [CONTACT_13802], 5.[ADDRESS_746578] been diagnosed with the condition (MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep, 2010). Evidence-based treatments improve outcomes for children with ADHD. The effectiveness of treatment for ADHD is supported by a large number of clinical trials and consists of psychotropic medications like methylphenidate, behavior therapy, and school-based modifications either alone or in combination (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2011; Pelham, Wheeler & Chronis, 1998; MTA Cooperative Group, 1999; Hoffman & DuPaul, 2000, American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry,1997; Charach, Dashti, Carson, et al., 2011; Subcommittee on Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, 2011).  Unfortunately, engagement in and adherence to ADHD treatment is poor, limiting the effectiveness of evidence-based strategies. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_569418], many children with ADHD do not receive evidence-based care over the long-term (Zima, Hurlburt, Knapp, et al., 2005). Research has found poor adherence and inconsistent use of effective treatments in community studies, with only a third of children receiving treatment over a year (Froehlich, Lamphear, Epstein, et al., 2007; Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, 2011). In fact, up to 44% may receive no evidence-based treatment. Of those who are treated, a majority of children (80%) receive medication, and less than half receive behavioral interventions (Zima, Bussing & Tang, 2010). National guidelines prioritize shared decision making (SDM) as a strategy to engage families in treatment and improve adherence and outcomes. SDM is particularly helpful for conditions like ADHD that have multiple evidence-based options and in which variation exists in how families weigh their risks and benefits (Barry, 2002).   Our prior research found that families who were more easily able to contact [CONTACT_150359]’s doctor outside of office visits were more likely to report high levels of SDM (Fiks, Localio, Alessandrini, Asch & Guevara, 2010), suggesting that interventions that facilitate communication and information sharing outside the context of office visits may improve SDM and engagement in care. However, the bulk of research and conceptual work on SDM has focused on a single point-in-time decision in a single patient-provider interaction (Brinkman et. al., 2011; O'Connor, Bennett, Stacey, et al., 2009). This proposal broadens the definition of SDM by [CONTACT_342310] a chronic childhood condition (ADHD) with longitudinal decision-making between patients/parents and multiple providers. For this study The Vanderbilt Parent and Teacher Rating Scales (VPRS and VTRS) will be used to measure ADHD symptoms, and are standard validated measures of ADHD symptom severity that are commonly employed in clinical care and ADHD research studies. The VPRS will be measured at baseline and 3-[ADDRESS_746579] review. The Services Assessment for Children and Adolescents (SACA) will be used to measure treatment initiation and adherence, and is a valid and reliable parent-report measure of the types of mental health services used over the previous 9-12 months, service settings, reasons for service use, and quality of services. Goal Attainment Scaling (GAS) will be used to measure goal attainment, and is a validated method to rating the degree to which parents feel their goals have been met. Families will identify individual goals using the ADHD PGI and rate their progress towards completing 
   
   3 the goals individually. Patient-reported outcomes will be measured by [CONTACT_484802] (PROMIS) short forms and by [CONTACT_569429] (HP) Scales. Both of these tools are validated, reliable and accurate measures of patient reported outcomes and aspects of health and well-being. Treatment initiation and adherence will be measured by [CONTACT_569430], and by [CONTACT_569431] (SACA). The SACA is a valid and reliable parent-reported service use and quality of services.  1.4 Compliance Statement This study will be conducted in full accordance all applicable Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_158737] 45 CFR 46. All epi[INVESTIGATOR_48478]. The investigators will perform the study in accordance with this protocol, will obtain consent and assent, and will report unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others in accordance with The Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_137069]. Collection, recording, and reporting of data will be accurate and will ensure the privacy, health, and welfare of research subjects during and after the study.  2 STUDY OBJECTIVES The purpose of the study is to determine the comparative effectiveness of an electronic patient portal designed to communicate family-centered preferences and goals for treatment of ADHD with providers and educators (Tier 1) with the electronic patient portal combined with a CM to facilitate communication (Tier 2) for children with ADHD. This study also aims to assess treatment initiation and adherence and family engagement as mediators of intervention treatment effects. Additionally, this study aims to investigate test-retest reliability of the PFCC measure. Parents in the intervention arm who have otherwise completed the study will be asked to fill out a satisfaction survey about their use of the care manager. Finally, this study aims to explore individual, family, and community factors that moderate intervention treatment effects. 2.1 Primary Objective (or Aim) The primary objective of this study is to determine the comparative effectiveness of an electronic patient portal designed to communicate family-centered preferences and goals for treatment of ADHD with providers and educators (Tier 1) with the electronic patient portal combined with a CM to facilitate communication (Tier 2) for children with ADHD. This aim will test whether children in the portal plus CM arm (Tier 2) have greater goal attainment at 9-12 months and fewer symptoms than children in the portal only arm (Tier 1) at 3-5, 6-8, and 9-12 months.   2.2 Secondary Objectives (or Aim) The secondary objectives are to: 
   
   4 •  Assess treatment initiation and adherence and family engagement as mediators of intervention treatment effects  • Explore individual, family, and community factors that moderate intervention treatment effects. • Investigate test-retest reliability of PFCC survey • Investigate intervention group parent satisfaction with the care manager • Evaluate intervention group outcome experience with care management and study feedback  [ADDRESS_746580] a prospective, randomized comparative effectiveness trial. Children will be randomized 1:1 to the ADHD portal (Tier 1) or the ADHD portal plus CM (Tier 2). We chose a prospective randomized design, because it is most effective at guarding against bias and will ensure that the patients in both arms are similar in observed and unobserved characteristics. We plan to control statistically for any differences in treatment preferences between arms in the analysis.  3.1.[ADDRESS_746581] been used in our prior work with urban populations to maintain >80% participant follow-up (Power et al., 2010).

Children will be randomized 1:1 to the ADHD portal (tier 1) or the ADHD portal plus Care Manager (tier 2). We chose a prospective randomized design, because it is most effective at guarding against bias and will ensure that the patients in both arms are similar in observed and unobserved characteristics. Planned centrally by [CONTACT_543584], randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_14603], gender, and age groups (5-7 years old and 8-12 years old) to ensure balance. We plan to control statistically for any differences in treatment preferences between arms in the analysis. Allocation concealment (blinding of the treatment assignment) will be implemented using sealed, opaque envelopes, along with stratification, and randomly permuted blocks of unequal sizes (to prevent providers and patients from manipulating the randomization to favor any treatment). Treatment assignment will be done at the time of enrollment following informed consent and patients will be followed with measures related to ADHD symptom severity, goal attainment, and patient-reported outcomes collected at baseline, 3-5 months, 6-8 months, and 9-12 months. Blinding in this study is not relevant. 3.3 Study Duration, Enrollment and Number of Sites 3.3.1 Duration of Study Participation Families who consent to participate will be enrolled in the study for 9-12 months and contact[CONTACT_51095]-up at 3-5 months, 6-8 months, and 9-12 months to complete study measures.  3.3.2 Total Number of Study Sites/Total Number of Subjects Projected We will recruit up to 15 practices to participate in the study. At each practice, we will recruit 20 or more participants to achieve a total sample size of 300 parent-child dyads. 3.4 Study Population Patients 5 through 12 years old with ADHD will be recruited from up to 15 pediatric primary care practices within the Pediatric Research Consortium (PeRC), an Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) supported practice-based research network at The Children's Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6684] (CHOP).

Patients and their families will be randomized 1:1 to 1) ADHD electronic patient portal (Tier 1) or 2) ADHD electronic patient portal paired with a CM (Tier 2).  (Tier 1) The ADHD portal. The ADHD system was developed with extensive user input and usability testing. As part of the development of this grant, we have already engaged parent, teacher, and clinician stakeholder members in establishing a preliminary set of system requirements. These requirements include that the portal (1) capture and share patient and family treatment preferences and goals, (2) monitor ADHD symptoms, treatment receipt and side effects as well as goal attainment, and (3) facilitate communication. The system will prompt completion of periodic check-in surveys (bi-weekly to 3 months). Within the portal, preferences and goals for ADHD treatment will be measured using the ADHD PGI (Fiks et al., 2012). Parents will be encouraged to consult with their children when completing the tool.  (Tier 2) Patient portal with CM to facilitate SDM and promote adherence (Appendix 2): The use of a patient portal combined with a CM addresses the potential limitations of reliance on technology alone to communicate information (Michel et al., 2015; Jackson, Cheater, & Reid, 2008). The CM provides an individual responsible for communicating information and facilitating coordination of care. Using data captured in the portal, the CM will meet with families at the beginning of the study to confirm their treatment preferences and goals, provide additional education on ADHD treatment, and distribute handouts on common concerns among ADHD patients and families. The CM will contact [CONTACT_569427] [ADDRESS_746592] developed in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_271907]-reported task completion of treatment components by [CONTACT_8888] (0- not completed, 1- partially completed, 2- fully completed).

They may also be discontinued from the study at the discretion of the Investigator for lack of adherence to study treatment or visit schedules, AEs, or due to development of exclusion criteria. It will be documented whether or not each subject completes the clinical, and data collected while the subject was enrolled in the study will be kept on file. Collected data will be kept until data collection and data analysis have been finalized, after which all personal identifiers will be removed.  
   
   [ADDRESS_746594] Review Include a listing of the variables that will be abstracted from the medical chart (paper or electronic). • Name • Date of Birth • MRN (medical record number) number • Outpatient clinical visits • Medications • Problem list • VPRS scores • VTRS scores  4.4.2 Other Evaluations, Measures To measure ADHD symptoms, we will use the NICHQ Vanderbilt Assessment Follow Up—PARENT Informant (Appendix 9) Scale, a follow-up form of the Vanderbilt Parent Rating Scale (VPRS) a standard validated measure of ADHD symptom severity that is commonly employed in clinical care and ADHD research studies, at baseline and 3-5 months, 6-8 months, and 9-12 months (Wolraich et al., 1998; Wolraich, et al., 2003). The VPRS is a public domain tool that consists of parent forms (separate from teachers, the Vanderbilt Teacher Rating Scale, or VTRS) and includes [ADDRESS_746595] disorder, and 12 items that screen for anxiety and depression. The Vanderbilt Follow Up items from the VPRS are scaled on a 4-point Likert rating (“never” to “very often”), but the scales used in this study will be restricted to the 18 ADHD symptom items and the 8 Performance Items, excluding further questions regarding Medication. In validation studies, the internal consistency of the VPRS and VTRS were excellent (alpha=0.90-0.94), and concurrent validity was high (r=0.79) in relation to diagnostic interviews. The Vanderbilt scale will permit us to compare effects between treatment arms and with the results of other studies. These scores have been identified as important by [CONTACT_569433].  To determine goal attainment, patient and family treatment goals will be identified through use of the ADHD PGI. Goal Attainment Scaling (GAS), will then be used to allow parents to rate the degree to which each of their goals, identified using the ADHD PGI, is met (Grissom, Erchul, & Sheridan, 2003; Jitendra et al., 2007; Sheridan, Eagle, Cowan, & Mickelson, 2001). The GAS response categories are ordered from -2 (“situation got significantly worse”) to +2 (“goal completely met”). Parents will complete the GAS (Appendix 5) at 3-[ADDRESS_746596] sort procedure also participated in cognitive interviews. Cognitive interviews were used to evaluate the appropriateness and understandability of caregiver engagement questionnaire items for parents of children with ADHD. A cognitive debriefing technique identified problematic phrasing and elicited alternative words and phrases that parents use to describe the item concepts. Prior to completing the questionnaire parents will be able to identify whom they consider part of their ADHD study team. Then parents will rate to the degree in which they are engaged in their child’s ADHD treatment planning and implementation The satisfaction survey will be administered after month 9-[ADDRESS_746597] of 8 questions scaled on a 5-point Likert scale (“Strongly Disagree” to “Strongly Agree”). This survey will also include two open-ended questions, “What did you like about the care manager program?” and “How would you suggest improving the care manager program?”. The qualitative interview will be conducted after the [ADDRESS_746598] of 9 open-ended questions (Appendix 20 Qualitative Interview) 4.5 Efficacy Evaluations 4.5.1 Diagnostic Tests, Scales, Measures, etc. Methods and timing the measures that will be used to assess efficacy Study Measures and Timing Measure Source Time to Complete (minutes) Timing (months) ADHD PGI (primary) Parent 5 0 VPRS (primary) Parent 5 0, 3-5, 6-8, 9-12 VTRS (primary) Epic records n/a (usual care) n/a (usual care) GAS (primary) Parent 1-2 3-5, 6-8, 9-12 Engagement (M) Parent 3-5 3 Medications (M) her 0 1-9-12 SACA (M) Parent 10 9-12 PROs (secondary)    School performance Child, Parent 3-5 0,9-12 Student engagement Child, Parent 3-5 0,9-12 Peer relationships Child, Parent 3-5 0,9-12 Family belonging Child, Parent 3-5 0,9-12 Teacher connectedness Child, Parent 3-5 0,9-12 PFCC Questionnaire Parent 10 9-12, 9.5-12 Satisfaction Survey Parent 10 9+

The research team will query participants at every follow up visit to determine if personal health information has been disclosed.  5 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 5.1 Primary Endpoint The primary endpoints will be the change in ADHD Symptoms (as measured by [CONTACT_569434]) and the change in Goal Attainment (as determined by [CONTACT_569435]) between baseline and the 3-5, 6-8, and 9-12-month points. 5.2 Secondary Endpoints Secondary endpoints will include the following: • The change in PROs, which parents of children with ADHD and teachers have identified as most important: school performance, student engagement, peer relationships, family belonging, and teacher connectedness. • To evaluate consistency of PFCC measure that was developed for purposes of this study. • Parent satisfaction in the intervention group with the services rendered by [CONTACT_569436]. • Parent outcome experience and feedback in the intervention group with care management.  5.[ADDRESS_746600] two years: 59% white, 31% black or African American, and 5% Hispanic. The actual demographic distribution of enrolled participants may differ slightly. The study team also expects that the gender distribution will reflect the gender distribution of children with ADHD in the CHOP Care Network: 72% male, 28% female.  5.3.2 Efficacy Analysis Primary analyses will be based on an intention to treat approach and will include all subjects as randomized. We will follow usual guidelines for reporting results (CONSORT) 
   
   12 (CONSORT Group, 2010), and will report all outcomes in both absolute (how much change) and relative terms (percentage change). In sensitivity analyses to examine the impact of preference and treatment intensity, we will look at the effects of the intervention stratified by [CONTACT_569437] (frequency of interaction with the portal/CM).  The primary endpoints will be the change in ADHD Symptoms (as measured by [CONTACT_569434]) and the change in Goal Attainment (as determined by [CONTACT_569435]) between baseline and the 3-5, 6-8, and 9-12-month points. • Secondary endpoints will include the change in PROs, which parents of children with ADHD and teachers have identified as most important: school performance, student engagement, peer relationships, family belonging, and teacher connectedness. In addition, PFCC measure will be examined for internal consistency with test-retest reliability. The satisfaction survey will measure how satisfied parents in the intervention arm were with the services provided by [CONTACT_569436]. The qualitative interview will evaluate outcome experience and feedback in the intervention group with care management.   5.[ADDRESS_746601] binomial 95% two-sided confidence intervals. 5.5 Sample Size and Power Aim 1: The investigative team assumed that there will be 240 evaluable children parent-child dyads (from 300 enrolled), and that these will be divided 1:1 across the two groups. From these assumptions, power analyses we conducted based on simulations, in which two groups of 120 children were generated, followed over 3 time periods (totaling 9-12 months), where the measurements were correlated from baseline to 6-8 months (corr=0.8) and from baseline to 9-12 months (r=0.6). The investigative team assumed that the true differences between treatment groups was a score of 5.0 units over time. Once a dataset was simulated, a marginal model for longitudinal data was applied (GEE with a first order auto-regressive working correlation structure and robust variance estimates). For comparing the effect of the intervention, power of 0.[ADDRESS_746602] a difference of 2.5 points along the Vanderbilt score (assuming a standard deviation of [ADDRESS_746603] deviation of 5). These good levels of power are achievable with the longitudinal design.  Aim 2: For the outcomes of initiation and adherence, binary outcomes were assumed and performed analyses using the PASS 13 software (Hintze, 2011). For the purposes of this study, the ADHD PGI will be used to determine the level of initiation and adherence. Initiation is defined as starting a treatment plan for which one has moderate to greater preference. Adherence is defined as the continuation of treatment through month 9-12. Assuming that the tier 1 group of 120 children experiences a 50% rate of initiation and adherence, power would be about 0.[ADDRESS_746604] an increase in that rate among the tier 2 group to 70% and would be greater than 0.[ADDRESS_746605] an increase to 75%.  
   
   13 Aim 3: Again, the investigative team resorted to simulation to determine the power to detect an interaction of group and intervention. For this analysis, it was assumed that 50% of the children will come from inner city practices and the other 50% for non-urban locations. The investigative team also assumed further that the electronic intervention would work less well than the in-person intervention among inner-city children, but that it would work equally well among the suburban children. (1) Power is greater than 0.90 if the suburban tier 2, suburban tier 1, and urban tier 2 practices improve by 7 points on the symptoms scale (assuming a standard deviation of 6), and urban tier 1 practices improved by [INVESTIGATOR_13701] 2.5 points, a clinically meaningful difference. 
   
   14 6 SAFETY MANAGEMENT  6.1 Clinical Adverse Events Clinical adverse events (AEs) will be monitored throughout the study.  6.2 Adverse Event Reporting Since the study procedures are not greater than minimal risk, SAEs are not expected. If any unanticipated problems related to the research involving risks to subjects or others happen during the course of this study (including SAEs) they will be reported to the IRB in accordance with CHOP IRB SOP 408: Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to Subjects. AEs that are not serious but that are notable and could involve risks to subjects will be summarized in narrative or other format and submitted to the IRB at the time of continuing review.  
   
   15 7 STUDY ADMINISTRATION 7.1 Treatment Assignment Methods 7.1.1 Randomization Planned centrally by [CONTACT_20685]’s biostatistician, randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_14603], gender, and age groups (5-7 years old and 8-12 years old) to ensure balance. Any differences in treatment preferences between arms in the analysis will be statistically controlled.  Allocation concealment (blinding of the treatment assignment) will be implemented using sealed, opaque envelopes, along with stratification, and randomly permuted blocks of unequal sizes (to prevent providers and patients from manipulating the randomization to favor any treatment). Treatment assignment will be done at the time of enrollment following informed consent 7.[ADDRESS_746606]-protected computer. All databases for these study procedures will be maintained on CHOP’s secure research server, and all analyses will be performed on de-identified data only. All collected study measures will be entered directly into a REDCap database. Qualitative data will be entered into an NVivo database. The unique identifiers will be used to track enrolled families over the course of the study. Audio recordings will be transcribed by [CONTACT_271937] (http://www.adatranscription.com/). Audio recordings will be de-identified and sent via their secure server, and subsequent transcripts will be saved on a secure server accessed only by [CONTACT_40221]. Confidentiality will also be maintained by [CONTACT_271954]. Each member of the research team, including investigators, research assistants, and stakeholder-investigators will receive appropriate training in human subjects research and patient confidentiality.  2. Security  Study data will be collected and managed using the secure web-based REDCap database at CHOP, an active participant of the REDCap consortium (Fitzmaurice, Laird, & Ware, 2011). Participants will enter outcome data using a web-based interface that supports encrypted data transfer from its origin to the database housed in a secure data center in Norristown, PA. REDCap supports a simple interface for validated data entry, audit trails for tracking data manipulation, export procedures for seamless data downloads to statistical packages, and procedures for importing data from external sources. All data management and analysis will proceed on secure data and software servers that have daily back-up, This approach will facilitate data acquisition, prevent data theft and loss, and achieve maximum protection from 
   
   [ADDRESS_746607]-protected computer. All databases for these study procedures will be maintained on CHOP’s secure research server, and all analyses will be performed on de-identified data only. A complete, cleaned, and de-identified dataset will be made available to PCORI and other investigators after all analyses have been conducted and within nine months of the end of the final year of funding. To obtain this data set, other investigators may contact [CONTACT_9154] [INVESTIGATOR_569419] a data sharing agreement. The data sharing agreement will permit the data set to be shared once an IRB protocol has been approved at the investigators’ home institution and the investigators have signed a pledge to not attempt to identify individual study subjects. The data set will be made available on a CD-ROM or a secure FTP site. 7.[ADDRESS_746608] obtaining IRB approval. The investigative team will obtain a data use agreement between the provider (the PI) of the data and any recipi[INVESTIGATOR_5772] (including others at CHOP) before sharing a limited dataset (PHI limited to dates and zip codes).  To ensure confidentiality of information, data will be stripped of potential identifiers and all written and computerized files will be indexed by a unique identification number. Only research staff will have access to this information, and the PI [INVESTIGATOR_11247] a separate master list stored as a password protected document on a password-protected computer. All databases for these study procedures will be maintained on CHOP’s secure research server, and all analyses will be performed on de-identified data only. All collected study measures will be entered directly into a REDCap database. Qualitative data will be managed on NVivo. The unique identifiers will be used to track enrolled families over the course of the study. Confidentiality will also be maintained by [CONTACT_271954]. Each member of the research team, including investigators, research assistants, and stakeholder-investigators will receive appropriate training in human subjects research and patient confidentiality. The identifiable information from this study will be destroyed [ADDRESS_746609]. Families will be promptly informed of any disclosures of PHI.   7.4.2 Risk Assessment The research involves the collection of information from parents, children and teachers. The risk of participation is considered minimal. There is a potential risk of breach of confidentiality of information and study result about individuals. This risk is made minimal by [CONTACT_271955]; risks are greatly reduced by [CONTACT_171739], storing data on secure computers, using unique study identifiers, and de-identification of data prior to analysis. A second risk is that participants become uncomfortable in completing study measures. If this occurs, the protocol will allow participants to stop at any time. Should any specific concerns arise throughout the project period, the CHOP IRB will be promptly informed. Since the purpose of the intervention is to help families clarify their treatment preferences and goals and promote communication between families and clinicians, we expect that serious adverse consequences will be extremely rare and unlikely.   A further risk is that parents may use the portal (intended for non-urgent communication) for urgent behavioral health issues. This risk will be mitigated through direct instruction to parents at the time of consent and portal enrollment, warnings within the portal that it should not be used if immediate attention is needed, and clear guidance in any message transmitted through the portal that it is only meant for routine communication. This approach has proven effective in our prior trial of the MyAsthma portal.  This project will also involve the mappi[INVESTIGATOR_569420], which presents a risk of loss of confidentiality if maps are presented. To address this potential problem, and in instances where the number of subjects is less than 5, the CML will work closely with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_569421] a map. Among the techniques that may be applied if the case warrants are microaggregation—replacing the coordinates for a data point by [CONTACT_569438]—or blurring—placing data points on an irregular lattice by [CONTACT_569439] x and y coordinates and replacing each successive group of [ADDRESS_746610] health care providers in caring for patients in terms of fostering joint decision-making. This model may be replicated in different care settings and other diseases and thus generate generalizable knowledge. Further, the information obtained will be disseminated as widely as possible, including through submission for publication in peer-reviewed journals and presented at scientific and lay conferences.  The investigative team’s prior research found that families who were more easily able to contact [CONTACT_150359]’s doctor outside of office visits were more likely to report high levels of SDM, suggesting that interventions that facilitate communication and information sharing outside the context of office visits may improve SDM and engagement in care (Fiks et al., 2010). However, the bulk of research and conceptual work on SDM has focused on a single point-in-time decision in a single patient-provider interaction (Brinkman et al., 2011; O’Connor et al, 2009). This study broadens the definition of SDM by [CONTACT_342310] a chronic childhood condition (ADHD) with longitudinal decision-making between patients/parents and multiple providers. By [CONTACT_569440], prioritizing their treatment preferences and goals, and necessitating information sharing over time across the health and school systems that impact all children, SDM in ADHD is an ideal prototype to define strategies to foster patient-centered care, engagement, adherence, and improved outcomes in varied pediatric chronic conditions (e.g. asthma, depression). As such, the lessons learned regarding interventions to foster SDM in ADHD in this protocol are likely to yield generalizable knowledge for fostering patient-centered pediatric care.  7.4.[ADDRESS_746611] health care providers in caring for patients in terms of fostering joint decision-making. This model may be replicated in different care settings and other diseases and thus generate generalizable knowledge. Further, the information obtained will be disseminated as widely as possible, including through submission for publication in peer-reviewed journals and presented at scientific and lay conferences. Given the minimal risk nature of the study and the potential for benefit, the risk:benefit ratio is considered favorable.  7.5 Recruitment Strategy To obtain an unbiased sample, a stratified random sample of 300 eligible parent-child dyads will be drawn from participating practices taking into consideration the race/ethnicity/gender of the patients they serve to achieve a representative sample of children from the greater Philadelphia area. Physicians will distribute recruitment flyers to eligible families who are interested in learning more about the study to direct them to contact [CONTACT_569441]. Families will also be mailed recruitment letters signed by [CONTACT_29383] (PCP) or practice. Included in the mailing will be a stamped self-addressed postcard to permit families to opt out. Families who do not opt out will be called to screen 
   
   [ADDRESS_746612] been used in our prior work with urban populations to maintain >80% participant follow-up (Power et al., 2010).  Informed Consent/Assent and HIPAA Authorization 7.5.[ADDRESS_746613] data and sent recruitment letters from their participating practices. Those families that do not return opt out postcards will be called by [CONTACT_569442], screen for eligibility, and arrange for a consent visit. At the consent visit, parents will be asked to provide informed consent to participate in the study and to sign a HIPAA and FERPA waiver to enable the research team to reach out to individuals involved in their child’s ADHD care (Appendix 4). Up to 40 participants previously enrolled in the study will be asked to complete a verbal consent in order to fill out second PFCC measure. Up to 40 participants previously enrolled will be asked to complete a verbal consent before proceeding with the qualitative interview (Appendix 20 Qualitative Interview)  Waiver of Assent  Target population is age 5 through 12. Assent is requested to be waived for participants under the age of 7. Assent will be obtained from children aged 7-12 because they will be completing child PRO measures (Appendix 4).  7.5.2 HIPAA Authorization At the consent visit, parents will be asked to provide informed consent to participate in the study and to sign a HIPAA and FERPA waiver to enable the research team to reach out to individuals involved in their child’s ADHD care (Appendix 4).   7.6 Payment to Subjects/Families Participation incentives will include compensation to complete study measures, quarterly newsletters, and child birthday card mailings, all of which have been used in our prior work with urban populations to maintain >80% participant follow-up (Power et al., 2010). Participation incentives will include compensation of $[ADDRESS_746614] to complete parent reported study measures, $[ADDRESS_746615] mailings. Parents will receive the compensation listed above ($[ADDRESS_746616] visit and travel, $10 for second visit, $[ADDRESS_746617] visit, and $30 for fourth visit) for the completion of study visits per participant dyads. If subjects do not complete a study survey to completion they will not be compensated for their time. Therefore, only participants who complete all study visits will receive the full $100. After completing study measures compensation to parents will be processed immediately. Children who complete the Child PROs survey will receive a $[ADDRESS_746618] upon completing each study visit, earning up to $20 in gift cards throughout the study.   Participants who complete additional PFCC questionnaire will be paid $10.  Participants from the intervention arm who complete the satisfaction survey will be paid $5.  Participants from the intervention arm who complete the qualitative interview will be paid $40.  All payments will be completed through a refillable ClinCard.  7.6.1 Payments to parent for time and inconvenience (i.e. compensation) Parents will receive the compensation listed above ($[ADDRESS_746619] visit and travel, $10 for second visit, $[ADDRESS_746620] visit, and $30 for fourth visit) for the completion of study visits per participant dyads. Parents who complete second PFCC questionnaire will be paid $10. Parents who complete the intervention group satisfaction survey will be paid $5. Parents from the intervention group who complete the qualitative interview will be paid $40.  7.6.2 Payments to child for time, effort and inconvenience (i.e. compensation) Children ages 8-12 will receive compensation for completing the Child PROs survey. Children of participant dyads will be compensated up to $20, $5 per survey.   7.6.3 Gifts Families will be sent birthday cards on the child’s birthday. 8 PUBLICATION Caregiver and stakeholder partners will be involved in all dissemination activities. They will co-author manuscripts and participate in presentations at scientific and lay conferences. These conferences may include the Pediatric Academic Societies annual meetings where new pediatric science is presented and local meetings of the Parents Informed Network and the Philadelphia Department of Behavioral Health. Caregiver and stakeholder partners will participate with the research team in planning dissemination strategies. These will include a mixture of papers, reports, and presentations both locally and nationally. Caregiver and 
   
   21 stakeholder partners will be involved in disseminating their study results through their local employers (e.g. CHOP practices, local school districts) and through their affiliated societies. The following groups have been identified as key stakeholders for this project: 1) Pediatric patients with ADHD and their caregivers; 2) Clinical providers, including primary care physicians, social workers, case managers, psychiatrists, and therapi[INVESTIGATOR_569422]; and 3) Educators, including teachers, guidance counselors. Our dissemination strategy prioritizes dissemination to these groups of stakeholders and to the broader public and scientific community in order to facilitate implementation of the findings among these groups in real-world settings (PC-4). This strategy will be facilitated by [CONTACT_569443] (caregivers, teachers, clinicians) composed of [ADDRESS_746621] period. Our stakeholder partners include Lisa Snitzer, MSS, LSW and Denise Stewart, BS (caregiver partners), Siobhan Leavy, EdD (teacher stakeholder), and Steven Berkowitz, MD and Nathan Blum, MD (clinician stakeholders).  The research team plans to work closely with key stakeholders to disseminate and implement the findings of the research study into accessible and usable formats in research, clinical and community-based settings, including schools and pediatric practices. Aspects of the proposed research plan that facilitate dissemination include the implementation of an electronic ADHD portal that can be adapted for other EHRs, a Care Manager intervention that is manualized and thus transportable to other health care settings, and the use of patient-centered outcome measures written in an easy-to-read, user-friendly, low-literacy format that can be adopted by [CONTACT_569444].

10.Background: Describe the theory or data supporting the objectives of the study and(T-CAP), a technology -based intervention development and feasibility R21 study to 
examine the impact of integrating clinical telehealth services within an exist ing Illinois (IL)  
police Opi[INVESTIGATOR_556591] (ODP). The study includes three key components: 1) 
Development and testing of the proposed multidisciplinary telehealth intervention integrated 
within a state -supported police diversion program;  2) use of telehealth technology to provide 
ODP participants with access to clinically qualified staff (referred to as the Coach); and 3) 
expanding and strengthening the available service infrastructure including pain management 
alternatives to the use of potentially  addictive medica tions and by [CONTACT_556621] (e.g., underut ilized physicians 
and other medical providers such as certified nurse practitioners). Modifications  target use of 
vi
rtual consenting and utili zing FedEx mail to issue study cell phones to par ticipants, 
replacing in-person meetings with the T-CAP research assistant. No modifi cations have 
been made to the T-CA P telehealth intervention and no in-pe rson interactions will occur 
as a part of this study.  10.28.2022  modification will include the removal of the 
randomization procedure; specifically, no one will be assigned to what was previously 
referred to as the “Treatment as Usual” condition. All participants will receive the T-CAP 
telehealth intervention.   
The specific aims for the proposed research are as follows: (Aim 1) Demonstrate 
intervention feasibility by [CONTACT_556622], and (Aim 2) Evaluate the proposed T-CA P measures  to assess their 
performance in gauging the
 impact of telehealth on initiation of in-pe rson Substance Use 
(SU) treatment, short-te rm retention
 in referred SU treatment, and access to other 
appropriate treatment services.     
Successful completion of the aims is expected to: 1) establish preliminary evidence to 
support the efficacy of  telehealth technology to augment SU treatment for individuals with 
misused any form of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], alcohol, or other substances, 2) provide support for integrating 
a clinical role in police opi[INVESTIGATOR_556592]/or other substance misuse, 3) provide an empi[INVESTIGATOR_556593], 
and 4) demonstrate the value in building relationships with stakeholders to  leverage 
community  resources for addressing the SU  treatment needs. Findings  from this research 
will inform a
 future R01
 application that will include a multi-si te randomized clinic al trial, 
testing the T-CA P intervention
 and taking a closer look at characteristics of individuals (e.g., 
sex and race/ethnicity) in relation to intervention response and outcomes in an effort to 
understand how best to tailor the T-CA P intervention for specific subgroups.    
include a bibliography of key references as applicable.
This project focuses on opi[INVESTIGATOR_556594]. The opi[INVESTIGATOR_556595] (Gomes et al., 2018), driven by [CONTACT_556623][INVESTIGATOR_556596]
(CBHSQ, 2017; Moore et al., 2017; O’Donnell  et al., 2017; Rudd et al., 2016). The overdose deaths
attributed to these drugs (CDC, 2017; Warner et al., 2016) is impacting nearly every community.
TCU
1920-221

(Cosden et al., 2005; Ramirez et al., 2015). Similarly, the IL Police ODP offers an 
unprecedented opportunity to address the current widespread opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441], evidenced by [CONTACT_556624] 70% from  2013 and a 32% increase from 2015 to 20 16 (IDHA, 2017). 
IL ODP programs are part of a State priority to improve access to a spectrum of justice involv ed 
treatment options, including linking individuals to SU treatment, Medicati on Assisted Treatment 
(MAT), and alternative pain management services. Major challenges are impacting  uptake and 
adherenc e to opi[INVESTIGATOR_556597],  consistent with those identified  in multiple studies 
(Knudsen et al., 2011). While MAT is acknowledged as a best practice treatment option (Mattick 
et al., 2009; Mattick et al., 2014) a nd a key IL ODP component,  access  to the identified 
providers is limited (e.g., limited transportation options) and frequently underutilized. Another 
challenge is the ODP
 focuses on narrowly defined SU  treatment options; the ODP and its 
participants woul
d benefit from referrals to a wider spectrum of treatment options, including 
referral
 to alternative pain management services s uch as meditation or yoga centers (Cherkin et 
al., 2016). Treating
 the comorbidities of opi[INVESTIGATOR_556598]; over 87 milli on 
adults report using opi[INVESTIGATOR_556599] 10 million of this group indicate 
misusing these medications 
(CBHSQ, 2017). Additionally, research shows an increased risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_556600] d use 
disorder (OUD) from abusing opi[INVESTIGATOR_22388] (Muhuri et al., 2013) and transitioning to 
heroin use when obtaining prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_556601] (Al-T ayyib et al.,  2017; 
Cicero et al., 2014; Compton et al., 2016). Thus, expanding the ODP service delivery 
infrastructure to include a broader array of services has significant potential to improve 
clinical practice and lessen the effects of the opi[INVESTIGATOR_8562].     
The current IL ODP model 1) lacks inclusion of trained clinical staff  (ODP staff receive 4 hours of 
training) a nd 2) provides limited clinical recovery  support for clients after  program intake.  As 
outlined in a recent State report (Reichert et al., 2017), officers are being asked to make clinical-
level decisions for
 which they have not been hired or trained. Furthermore, there is minimal ODP 
contact [CONTACT_556625]. Integrating clinically qualified staff i n the 
ODP process to work with the police during the screening and referral process, and 
providing ODP clients with continued clinical support after program intake, has 
significant potential to improve clinical practice and lessen the effects of the opi[INVESTIGATOR_305065]. Inclusion of the clinical advocate role is based on research showing the importance of 
trained clinicians during brief client encounters  and interventions (Gaume et al., 2014).

1920-[ADDRESS_731105] Population: Descr
ibe the characteristics of the participant population
including the inclusion and exclusion criteria and the number of participants you plan
to recruit:
A total of 40 cl
ients admitted to the Opi[INVESTIGATOR_556591] (ODP) will be enrolled for the
12.Recruitment Procedure: Describe your recruitment strategies including how the
potential participants will be approached and precautions that will be taken to
minimize the possibility of undue influence or coercion. Include copi[INVESTIGATOR_556605], leaflets, etc. in your submission.
Recruitment will take place with clients  w ho are recently accepted int o the police Opi[INVESTIGATOR_556606] (ODP) available in participating police agencies in Lake County, Illinois.
We will coordinate with polic
e agencies  to put  up an informational poster i n each agency,
introducing the research opportunity; length of the intervention (12  weeks); and eligibility
criteria (stated in #11 above). The poster will also state that participation is voluntary  ,  and (c)
compensation for completed study
 activities. This same information will be incl uded in a
Recruitment Flier (see Appendix) that  will be available to new ODP clients after they have
completed t
he intake screening for the diversion program.  Clients who are interested in
hearing more about the study
 will be asked by [CONTACT_556627] (LCHD) staff
to electronically sign
 a release authorizing LCHD to release the client’s  name [CONTACT_3669]
[CONTACT_424926] T-CAP Research Assistant (RA). The releas e will be signed before ODP
clients start
 outpatient or residential  treatment, following ODP intake (screening and
treatment referral). The TCU RA
 will contact [CONTACT_48553] a via phone to schedule a time for the
virtual Informed Consent session  that is convenient to the individual.
13.Consenting Procedure: Describe the consenting procedure, whether participation is
completely voluntary, whether the participants can withdraw at any time withoutT-CAP study and all will receive the T-CAP intervention. Since the sample will be drawn from
the existi
ng ODP, sociodemographic characteristics are expect ed to be similar to  census
demographics for the corresponding communities,
 with approximately  59% male,  88% white,
and aver
age age of 32. In addition, we expect approximately 40% will need mental health
services as part of their treatment and  60% will need services for medical problems. The ODP
screens out individuals who have a criminal record of violent offenses. While all current ODP
clients have a recent history (within the past 12 months) of  opi[INVESTIGATOR_556607],
we will confirm this during the RA’s administration of the TCU Drug Screen 5 and TCU Drug
Screen 5—O pi[INVESTIGATOR_556608]. If this process reveals that the individual does  not have a
recent history of
 opi[INVESTIGATOR_556609], they will be offered the opportunity  to remain in the
study but
 excluded from the primary analyses. Furthermore, individuals who are not willing to
consent to granting researc h staff permission to access their  police and treatment services
records, and individuals who do not understand the  informed consent (see appendix for the
Informed Consent Comprehension Questions),
 will be excluded from t he study. Individuals
must demonstrate the ability to speak and understand Englis h and be at least 18 years ol d to
participate in this study. At
 the Informed Consent meeting, the RA will determine that these
criteria are met.

offered for participation.  If students are used  as participants, indicate an alternative 
in lieu of participation if course credit is provided for participation. If a vulnerable population is recruited, describe the measures that will be taken to obtain surrogate 
consent (e.g., cognitively impaired participants) or assent from minors and permission from parents of minors.       
In T-CAP, the RA
 will be 
the only researcher who 
will Administer informed 
Consent. The RA will 
contact [CONTACT_556628] (OP) 
treatment by [CONTACT_285252] [ADDRESS_731106] knowledg e about an individual’s decision 
to learn more about the project and plans to meet wit h the Research Assistant (RA) at an 
arranged location, once released. The RA will arrange                   phone meetings with 
interested clients; within [ADDRESS_731107], and answer any questions. The RA will 
then send the Qualtrics link to the individual’s cell, tablet, or PC. Consent as well as 
responses to the Eligibility  Questions (see Eligibility Questions i n the Appendix)  will be 
recorded via Qualtrics where participants will click on their responses for consent such as “I 
agree to participate” or
 “I do not agree to participate.” The RA will confirm the consent 
agreement to participate in the study by [CONTACT_556629], before calling back to 
ask if the participant has follow-u p questions about the study and to describe the steps to 
complete baseline data collection. Participation will be completely  voluntary  and clients will 
be told that there are
 no legal consequences for declining participation, including having no 
effect on ODP status.    
There are two Consent versions for the study activities in T-CAP; the Primary Study 
Informed Consent document will be use
d with the main study sample (N=40). In addition, we 
will
 contact [CONTACT_556630] a random sample of [ADDRESS_731108] interviews. [Virtual consent documentation is attached

release of behavioral healthcare agency data from the substance use treatment provider
(providing services as part of the Opi[INVESTIGATOR_556591]) to the research team for
tracking participants across the 12
-week intervention, thus providing tr eatment performance
indicators. The Primary Study Informed Consent will also state that behavioral healthcare
data will be requested by [CONTACT_39292]
h team using a variation of the Research ID (referred to
as the Treatment Code) t o link data to a participant. The Treatment Code is an arbitrary
number a ssigned to each participant by [CONTACT_5051]. The Code will be provided to the
behavioral healthcare provider in a file
 that links the Code to the participant’s name.
Therefore, data requests from t he research team will include only the Treatment Code, which
providers will use to identify the client from the linking file. Behavioral healthcare providers
will use only the Treatment
 Code in submitting data to the research  team. Behavioral agency
data will be shared with the research team via upload to TCU Box, a secure online data

or tablet are accessible for download by [CONTACT_113640] T-CAP  research staff from the TCU 
Qualtrics server. Dat a will not be stored on the Qualtrics server after download to an Excel 
file on a secure server i n the IBR offices. The server where the Excel files will be stored at 
the IBR follows  TCU  Information Technology security policies, including high-lev el security 
and encryption, and includes access  password protection. In addition, the computer drives 
and partitions where the files are located ar e encrypted by [CONTACT_556637] h a 256-bit  key, and 
individual
 files will be password protected by [CONTACT_9154]. This file security protocol  is NIH-
compliant, and current TCU  IRB-app roved (as well as past IRB-app roved studies) follow this 
protocol.  Research data in paper form are kept for a period of [ADDRESS_731114] paper versions 
available as an alternate to the Qualtrics Survey versions in case of issues with technology.  
In the event that the participant encounters issues with accessing the Qualtrics link to 
complete the baseline documents, paper forms will be mailed to participants at their home 
address along with two stamped FedEx return envelopes (one for  surveys and one to return 
the Demographics and Contact [CONTACT_556638]) addressed to the TCU IBR 
(attention to: Jen Pankow). However, paper forms are intended only as a back-u p option and 
will not be offered to participants as an alternative to the virtual Qualtrics survey.  Again, the 
data on paper forms will be identified only with the Research ID which will be entered by [CONTACT_556639], PI, into the participant tracking spreadsheet listing the issued   Research ID’s that 
are included in each FedEx package.   
At the
 IBR, these documents will be stored in a locked file cabinet  in a locked room, and all 
will be kept separate from all study data at all times, accessible  only to authorized project 
staff at IBR offices. I BR project staff will enter the information from  these forms into an excel 
database on a secure computer accessible only to authorized  project staff at IBR offices.    
Baseline procedures. The RA will describe  the participant’s options  for phone equipment. In 
the event
 that the participant chooses to use their own phone for the study, the RA will assist 
the
 participant with downloading the
 T-CA P app. Participants who choose to use a  study-
issued
 phone will receive a FedEx delivered smart phone with the T-CA P app pre-lo aded 
and instructions for use. For participants who choose to use their own phone equipment, the 
study will reimburse in the amount of $25 (in the form of an electronic gift card) per month to 
participants who are engaged in the entire 12-we ek intervention.  For participants who opt  to 
use the research smart phone equipment, phones will be on an unlimited plan maintained 
through the IBR.

After the phone equipment decision is made by [CONTACT_2299], the RA will document (in the 
participant tracking spreadsheet) the date, whether the phone is owned or research- issued, 
phone number, and the phone FCC ID number for each participant. In the event that a participant loses a research- issued phone, the participant will be advised by [CONTACT_21118], that the 
project will provide [ADDRESS_731115] information on the T -
CAP Flier, included with the participant’s copy of the Consent document. In the event that a 
participant does not have access to email or a borrowed phone, they can contact  [CONTACT_556640].      
Phone and T -CAP app instructions, included in the mailed FedEx package, will explain the 
app to the participant, describing the app features (text messaging and video call options).  
The app will be pre- populated with phone numbers  for the RA and the Coach. The app also 
features an icon for support, should a participant have an issue with a login or password. 
The instructions will guide the participant to turn on the phone. Participants will receive a 
welcome message from the RA, and the RA will provide the participant with the name [CONTACT_556663] (below) for scheduling the first telehealth video call for later that same day or the next day. In cases where a participant joins the study on a Friday, the Coach will  text message the participant no later than the Monday that follows (i.e., within 3 
days after baseline surveys are completed).    
After the baseline procedures are complete, the RA will confirm that all participant information has been entered in the tracking spreadsheet on the RA password protected laptop and then uploaded to TCU Box. The RA will then send a text message to the assigned Coach, indicating that there is an updated tracking spreadsheet with new 
participant information, ready for download.     
Steps for scheduli
ng the first telehealth video call: 
(1)The participant will receive a text message from the Coach indicating the day, date,
and time for the first telehealth session.
(2)The participant will send a reply to confirm the scheduled video call.
(3)At the scheduled time, the Coach will initiate the video call and the participant will
have the option to “Accept” or “Decline” the call (similar to the feature on Zoom).
During the first telehealth session, the participant and Coach will determine astanding day and time for the remaining [ADDRESS_731116] the RA for any schedule changes  on  video calls.

14. Data Analyses: Describe how you will analyze your data to answer the study question
Aim 1: Demonstrate intervention feasibility by [CONTACT_556650] o f the telehealth approach. Feasibility will be primarily assessed by [CONTACT_556651], satisfaction, and telehealth usability data. We will examine
distributions
 on these measures as  well as characteristics of participants with high and low
participation sample size, we will be more interested in trends than in statistical significance.
Receptivity and utilization will be  assessed by [CONTACT_6270]-r eport measures as well as participation data
from the T-C AP app. Self-report measures will include the Telehealth Usability Questionnaire
(TUQ), T elehealth Session surveys, and semi-s tructured closeout interviews. The TUQ gauges
constructs that are consisten t with those in the telehealth literature and include: Usefulness,
Ease 
of Use Interaction Quality, Satisfaction and Future Use, Interface Quality; and Reliability.
TUQ scores o f 4.0 (agree) and above on each domain indicate high receptivity. Scores below
4.0 will be interpreted as  an indication that the participant encountered some challenge in that
area of 
using the telehealth system. Data from the TCAP app will provide evidence of utilization
(i.e.,
 process data on session completion, duration, and number of unscheduled c ontacts). Two
satisfaction
 questions are asked after each video conferencing s ession. We will primarily
examine counts and distributions of these data but will also examine characteristics of
participants with high and low levels of participation. All individuals will be invited to participate
in an interview with a member of the research team. Our goal is to obtain feedback at the study
closeout (Time 3) from a minimum of 6-8 participants. Drawing on  our extensive qualitative
experience, a  semi-s tructured interview with questions from the TUQ, paired with relevant
probes, will guide the interview to help us gain a better understanding about how the telehealth
experience 
impacted participants.
Aim 2: Evaluate the proposed T-C AP measures  to assess their performance in gauging the 
impact
 of telehealth on initiation of in-person Substance Use (SU) treatment, short-t erm 
retention in referred SU treatment, and access to other appropriate treatment services (e.g., 
MAT). Our multidimensional approach includes  data from self-r eport attendance and treatment 
engagement, s elf-report drug use, Coaches’ advocate records on number of completed 
assertive referrals, and agency records from police and BH providers (including intake and 
during-p rogram UA test results). In order to examine groups differences for intervention 
completers  (C) vs non-c ompleters (NC) (i.e., individuals who do not complete the 7 coaching 
video calls), group differences using t-t ests and chi-s quare tests and we will estimate effect 
sizes needed for determining a sample size for a future R01 proposal. To assess potential 
assignment 
bias, we will test to see if there are baseline differences in demographics: 
participant race, gender, age and other demographic characteristics, as well as baseline 
measures
 of opi[INVESTIGATOR_556610]-s quare and t-t ests. 
Effect sizes will be computed for group differences on multiple outcomes  (treatment initiation, 
retention, r eferrals to ex panded SU service options,  missed appointments). Service attendance 
records
 will be corroborated monthly with service provider records. Examinations of referrals  to 
MAT 
and alternative pain management care between the C and NC groups, utilizing agency 
records data and the Coach tracking, will be conducted using a  z-score to test differences in 
proportions of referral types. This will be calculated for all assertive referrals (resulting in 
scheduled appointments) collectively for a participant, as well as for different types of services. 
Analyses of Secondary outcomes. We will examine differences between C and NC groups on 
several secondary outcomes. Analyses will typi[INVESTIGATOR_556611] t-t ests, chi-s quare tests, and 
correlations. For example, we will use t-tests to assess differences between groups on the 3-
month follow-u p measures

16.Procedures to Maintain
 Confidentiality: Describe how the data will be collected,
deidentified, stored, used, and disposed to protect confidentiality. If protected health
information is to be re -identified at a later date, describe the procedure for doing so.
All signed consents and hard data must be stored for a minimum of 3 years in alocked filing cabinet (and locked room) in the principal investigator’s office, lab, or
storage closet at TCU. Your professional  society may recommend keepi[INVESTIGATOR_556613] a longer period of time.
Data from f ive sources  w ill be subject to confidentiality procedure: (1) Qualtrics  Surveys at 
baseline, 6 weeks and 12 weeks,  (2) data from telehealt h sessions,  (3) data from Coaches,  
(4) data from community behavioral health providers, and (5) qualitative data fromparticipant interviews.
The
 first step in maintaining confidentiality is to assign each participant an arbitrary 
Research ID that will be used on all data for that participant.  A Master Link File will be 
maintained by [CONTACT_978], Project Coordinator, Coaches and the field RA that will include the 
participant’s name, Research ID, and study phone number. Treatment Code (described 
below) will only be included in the Master Link File maintained by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_427131]. This file will be encrypted and stored at the IBR on a secure computer separate from any other participant data. The Master Link File will be password protected, stored electronically, and kept separate from all other data files. It will be accessible only to 
authorized project staff.      
Surveys. The RA will need to have the Master Link File on their TCU- owned secure laptop 
computer for tracking participants and obtaining Research IDs t o enter on project materials. 
The laptop will be protected by a strong password and the link file, a Microsoft Excel 
database, will be encrypted and protected by a strong password.  Every time a participant comes to complete a survey battery, the RA will use the participant name [CONTACT_556665]. This will bring up the name [CONTACT_556666]. The RA will enter the Research ID on the Qualtrics survey battery or on the 
paper version alternative. Updated Master Link  Files will be uploaded by [CONTACT_556653] (PI [INVESTIGATOR_556614]).Master Link Files will not be stored in a TCU Box folder.    
The RA will instruct the participant not to put their name [CONTACT_556667]. The Demographics Form —completed only at baseline— includes questions 
on demographics and background information, and does not have any questions of a sensitive nature.  When the participant returns the Demographics Form, it will be mailed to the IBR in an envelope with the Contact [CONTACT_130052]. In the event that the Baseline battery of assessments is completed on paper (this is a back -up option in the event that 
internet access is not functioning), the survey will be mailed to the IBR in a FedEx envelope,

a strong password and used for documenting assertive referrals and other support services  
(e.g., assistance with obtaining clothing, housing, or transportation) for individual 
participants, as well as case notes on MI telehealth sessions. The tracking files maintained by [CONTACT_556654] a weekly basis for the duration of the study. 
Downloaded caseload tracking files will be stored at the IBR on a TCU- secure computer 
accessible by [CONTACT_556655]; tracking files will be separate from the Master Link File.      
Behavioral healthcare provider data. Data requests to behavioral healthcare treatment providers will be conducted on a monthly basis. To facilitate the requests and maintain 
confidentiality, providers will be given a Treatment Code number (not the Research ID)  at 
the start of the study for individuals receiving services at their agency. The Provider Data Request Form (included in the Appendix), will include only the Treatment Code; no participant name [CONTACT_556668]. Completed forms will be uploaded by [CONTACT_556656]. Data from the forms will be entered into a provider data tracking Microsoft Excel file at the IBR. The Treatment Code will be maintained in the Master Linking 
File that will be encrypted and stored at the IBR on a secure computer separate from any 
other participant data.     
Participant interviews. The semi -structured interview (Individual Interview Guide is included 
in the Appendix) with a member of the research team will take place via meeting -specific 
HIPAA compliant Zoom chat or by [CONTACT_648]. Audio recordings will be processed at the IBR .   
Audio files will be uploaded on password protected computers the IBR by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_556615] a transcript service that we have used on multiple Federally -funded projects.  Transcription files will be redacted and formatted before upload 
to Atlas.ti coding software. Original audio files and transcripts will be stored at the IBR on a 
separate secure computer, accessible only to authorized project staff.

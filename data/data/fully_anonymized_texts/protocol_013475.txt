Section #2 - Core Protocol  
 
2.1 Objectives & 
Hypotheses  
 
 
 
 Primary  
To determine the absolute and relative effects at Tmax of Belsomra 10 
mg; 20 mg ; and placebo on responsivity  in nonelderly  insomniacs  (< 65 
yrs). 
 
We hypothesize that : 
1) Belsomra [ADDRESS_496186] a similar  awakening/arousal threshold compared  
to placebo   
2) Belsomra [ADDRESS_496187] a similar awakening/arousal threshold compared 
to placebo  
3) Belsomra [ADDRESS_496188] a similar awakening/arousal threshold to 
Belsomra 10 mg  
2.2 Background & 
Rationale , 
Significance of 
Selected Topic & 
Preliminary Data  
 Insomnia is characterized by [CONTACT_394950], waking frequently 
during the night, waking too early in the morning and not being able to get 
back to sleep, and waking feeling unrefreshed. Insomnia can be transient 
(lasting for several days), inter mittent (when transient insomnia recurs), or 
chronic (lasting for more than a month and has been reported in all age 
groups.  An estimated 30% -50% of the adult population is affected by 
[CONTACT_394951].   
 
Hypnotic medica tions are utilized to improve slee p initiation and/or 
maintenance.  The most commonly used hypnotics, Benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_394941] (BzRAs), bind at the  benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_394942] -A 
complex and demonstrate broad CNS depressant  effects  which  been shown 
to  reduce responsivity  to the environment , particularly at peak plasma 
concentrations  (Frey, et al., 2011; Zammit et al., 2008) . The ability t o respond 
following a nocturnal  stimul i is critical to safety (e.g., responding to fire 
alarms, infant s, burglary, or other emergencies)  (Johnson et al., 1983). 
Recently, the hypnotic suvorexant  (dual orexin antagonist)  has been shown to 
have no effects on the ability to wake  to a novel auditory stimuli  and thus 
may have a comparative benefit to B zRA hypno tics in terms of auditory 
awakening threshold (Tannenbuam et al., 2014 ; 2016 ). However, the previous 
study was not done in humans . The present study is designed to test arousal 
response (responsivity) at peak plasma levels following administration of 
Belso mra (10 and 20 mg)  compared to placebo. Specifically, responsivity  will 
be assessed using standardize d measures  as in a previous study of auditory 
awakening threshold (Drake et al., 2017) . The doses proposed are Belsomra 
10 mg and 20 mg as these represent the clinically recommended and util ized 
doses . 
The Primary objective is to determine the absolute and relative effects of 
Belsomra 10 mg and 20 mg  on responsivity  during sleep  in patients with 
insomnia at estimated Tmax versus placebo  (~2.[ADDRESS_496189] -dosing) . 
 
 
      MISP Template: Protocol  3 Final Version: 8/13/2010  Our Sleep Research Center has considerable experience in the design and 
execution of responsivity  studies . In a recent trial published in 2017  we 
compared the effects of a 10 mg dose of zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_394943]/Ataxia effects at T -max ( ~2.5 
hrs.). Results of this trial showed a significantly higher auditory awakening 
threshold for zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_394944] (p< .001). In addition , the effects 
of zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_394945] (p<.005).  We expect a similar effect size in the present study as 
compared to what was found for placebo in our previous trial.  
2.[ADDRESS_496190] crossover design with Belsomra  10 mg and 20 mg  compared 
to a placebo. The total number of enrolled patients proposed is 12 providing 
reasonable  power  (>70%) to detect  differences of  15 db vs. placebo  for 
Belsomra if present  (although no differences are expected) . Patients will be 
crossed over to experi ence all treatment conditions in a controlled  order 
(Belsomra 10 mg, 20 mg  and placebo).  Both men and women  with insomnia  
will be u tilized as the study  population to imp rove the generalizability of 
outcome data. However, we will enroll equal numbers of men and women in 
order to allow comparative analyses within both men and women , albeit with 
reduced power . In the overall analyses sex will be utilized as a covariate.  
Subjects with other sleep disorders or unstable medical/psychiatric disorders 
will be excluded from the trial. Inclusion criteria will be men  and women  >18 
and < 65 years of age . 
 
An initial standardized screening PSG will be used to rule out the presence  of 
sleep disordered breathing and/or periodic limb movements during sleep (mean 
AHI/PLMAI < 10/hr for both). The 3 study treatments include Belsomra 10 mg 
and 20 mg  with a middle -of-the-night awakening at ~2.5 hours ( BEL 10; 
BEL20 ), and placebo with a middle -of-the-night awakening at 2.5 hours 
(PBO ). Study drug will be administered under fasted conditions (at least 3 
hours) as a single dose at bedtime (approximately 2300 hours), and each subject 
will receive one dose of each active drug,  and one dose  of placebo duri ng the 
treatm ent period for a total of [ADDRESS_496191] will be 
administered study drug correspon ding with this assigned number.

      MISP Template: Protocol  6 Final Version: 8/13/2010  2.5 Study 
Procedures  Subjects will be screened by [CONTACT_394952] , and rule out medical disorders and sleep disorders other than 
insomnia.  In addition, participants will  complete medical history and be asked 
to complete a Sleep Health Survey and sleep disorders questionnaires to rule 
out restless leg syndrome and sleep disordered breathing (RLS screening 
questionnaire and STOP -BANG questionnaire).  Participants will be screened 
using standard urine and blo od chemistry laboratory tests (LabCorps) and be 
administered a breathalyzer to screen for alcohol and urine drug screen.  AAT 
protocol will be reviewed and demonstrated wit h each participant on the 
morning of the screening PSG.  
 
During the night of  each respective  PSG assessment night , subjects will be 
awoken at the approximate  T-max of the active drug (2 .5 hrs), with a 
matching placebo condition at the same time point using an identical 
responsivity  protocol for each condition. The rationale for th is is that t -max 
represents the time of  greatest potential  risk for a hypnotic in terms of 
balance, responsivity , and memory. Responsivity  will be assessed using the 
Auditory Awakening Threshold test (AAT) and will be measured at [ADDRESS_496194] dose for the Belsomra 10 and 20 mg  (BEL), and placebo (PBO) 
conditions.  Responsivity  will be assessed at the approximate time above 
immediately after 5 minutes of consolidated (without arousals) NREM stage 2 
sleep has occurred.  
 
Responsivity  Protocol: Responsivity  will be measured in response to a series 
(20-sec intervals) of increasing 1.5 -sec. tones at 520 Hz (fire alarm) with a 
range from 40 db to 110 db. The outcome measure will be the mean decibel 
level (db) at awakening (mean of 2 awakenings at ~T-max for eac h subject 
for each condition).  
 
Subjects will be discharged from the sleep center once all assessments have 
been completed.  A [ADDRESS_496195] prematurely discontinued 
the study.   
 
2.6 Study 
Duration  The expected duration of study participation for a patient is ~30 days, 
including up to 14 days for medical screening, and 3 one-night treatment s.  
All assessments will be separated by a 6 -12 day drug free interval. A 
maximum of 3 -4 patients will be enrolled in the study at a given time. Thus, 
the expected duration for study completion will be ~9 months.  
 
2.7 Statistical 
Analysis and 
Sample Size 
Justification  The Sleep Disorders Center  will be responsible for analyzi ng the study data 
(Investigator and expert statistical staff ).  The blind will be maintained during 
the study  and the data will be unblinded  at the completion of the trial . For the 
purpose of the final analysis, the official clinical database will not be unblinded 
until medical/scientific review has b een completed, protocol violation s have 
 
      MISP Template: Protocol  7 Final Version: 8/13/[ADDRESS_496196] data from each of the three  Treatment Period s 
with no major protocol violations. Safety analyses will be presented 
descriptively for the safety population; defined as all subjects who were 
randomized and received at least one dose of study medication.  
 
The primary endpoint  will be the mean Auditory Arousal Threshold in 
decibels (AAT) .  
 
All statistical analyses will be  conducted using IBM SPSS Statistics for 
Windows – Version 23 (Armonk, NY).  The primary outcome  of the study 
include within -person differences between active medications and respective 
placebo on the AAT. Univariate within -group comparisons for  these  
continuous endpoints  will be  accomplished via paired samples t -tests. 
Repeated -measures a nalysis of covariance (ANCOVA ) analyses will be used 
for estimating more complex models involving mul tiple factors or covariates  
(e.g., age. Given the extensive array of variables, covariates w ill be  selected for 
inclusion in omnibus models per recommendations outlined by [CONTACT_394953]  (1989) . Specifically, only those variables are related to the 
dependent variable in univariate analyses at a significance level of P < 0.20 will 
be retained in the final model.  Similar analyses will be used to examine all 
potential secondary /exploratory  endpoints . 
 
Power analyses: Based on a previous study using zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_6730] [ADDRESS_496197] to be 70% or greater for detecting 
a mean difference  of ~15 db between belsomra  and placebo given a sample of 
12 individuals . This assumes a variance of 15 db. In our previous study the 
variance was ~[ADDRESS_496198] size of d=1.0. We do not expect 
insomnia status to impact the arousal threshold effect size as shown in previous 
studies (Johnson et al., 1978).  
 
Safety and tolerability will be assessed by [CONTACT_394954], such as complex sleep -related behaviors, 
predefined limits of change for selected laboratory and vital sign values, as well 
as next -day residual effects. The primary approach for all safety analyses will 
be th e All Patients as Treated (APaT) approach. All randomized patients who 
receive at least one dose of study medication will be included in the safety 
analyses.  
 
The results will be reported using summary tables, figures, and data listings. 
Continuous variables will be summarized using mean, standard deviation, 
median, minimum, and maximum values. Categorical variables will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_132075] (frequency) and percentage in each 
category.  
 
      MISP Template: Protocol  8 Final Version: 8/13/2010  Demographics will be tabulated and summarized. Medical history data at 
Screening will be listed, as will Physical Examination data including height 
and weight.  Vital signs (resting heart rate, systolic/diastolic blood pressure, 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_7146]) will be tabulated and summarized.  
Treat ment -emergent adverse events will be listed and summarized. Adverse 
events reported in this study will be coded using MedDRA (Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities).  
Clinical laboratory data will be summarized with descriptive statistics.  
Abnormal  laboratory test results will be flagged in the subject data listings . 
 
2.8 Specific Drug 
Supply 
Requirements  Suvorexant will be supplied by [CONTACT_44873] . Due to the limited nature of study 
drug needed the HFHS pharmacy will not require bulk supplies (if necess ary 
study drug can be purchased by [CONTACT_394955]). Study drug will be unknown to the patient and 
therefore will be labeled only with study night number.  
2.9 Adverse 
Experience 
Reporting  Model Study Agreement will be  used and all safety/adverse event reporting 
will occur in strict accordance with those guidelines.   
2.10 Itemized 
Study Budget  Study budget for 12 completed participants = $ 299,435 (see attached detailed 
budget) . In order to facilitate the MISP evaluation of the proposed study and 
budget we have chosen  the most efficient study design, sample population, 
study duration, and subject numbers. However, we recognize that the present 
study parameters may have limitations . With this in mind we have provided an 
initial cost estimate, but adjustments to the proposed design could be 
effectively made to minimize such limitations  (i.e., increase /decrease  the 
number participants , add additional comparison doses, or additional st udy 
populations /measures ).

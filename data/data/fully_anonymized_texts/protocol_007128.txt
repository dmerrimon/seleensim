CONFIDENTIAL  3 SYNOPSIS  
Protocol Number:  
XBR1001 
Title:  
Xplore : A Phase III Double -Blind , Parallel Group, Multicenter Study to Compare the 
Efficacy and Safety of Xlucane versus Lucentis® in Patients  with Neovascular Age-
Related Macular Degeneration  
Investigational Product : 
Xlucane  
Study Centers:  
This study will be conducted at approximately [ADDRESS_68314] , and Asia- Pacific. 
Phase:  
Phase III  
Objectives:  
Primary objective:   
The primary objective of the study is to demonstrate that the proposed biosimilar 
candidate Xlucane is equivalent to Lucentis® in subjects with wet ( ie, neovascular) age -
related macular degeneration (wAMD)  as assessed by [CONTACT_63343] (BCVA) from Baseline to Week 8. 
Secondary objectives: 
• Evaluate the efficacy of Xlucane vs Lucentis® in subjects with wAMD based on 
central foveal thickness  measured by [CONTACT_43741] 
(SD-OCT ), area of choroidal neovasculari zation , and presence of leakage assessed by 
[CONTACT_63344] ( FA) 
• Evaluate the safety of Xlucane vs Lucentis® 
• Evaluate the systemic exposure of Xlucane vs Lucentis® in subje cts participating in 
pharmacokinetics (PK) evaluation 
• Evaluate immunogenicity (ie, anti -ranibizumab antibodies and neutralizing anti-drug 
antibodies [NAb] ) of Xlucane vs Lucentis® 
Study Design:  
This is a phase III  multicenter, double -blind (double- masked ), randomized, parallel  group 
study in subjects with wAMD. Approximately 580 subjects will be enrolled and 
randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either Lucentis® (0.05 mL of 10 mg/mL ranibizumab) 
or the investigational product , Xlucane (0.05 mL of 10 mg/mL ranibizumab) , in the study 
eye once every 4 weeks (monthly) for 52 weeks ( ie, 12 months).

CONFIDENTIAL  The study eye will be defined as the eye meeting all of the inclusion criteria and none of 
the exclusion criteria ( ie, the enrollment criteria).  
The assigned study drug will be administered as an ophthalmic intravitreal (IVT) 
injection. Designated, unmasked study staff will prepare and administer the study drug, 
ensuring that the mask ing of the subject  is maintained during the injection procedure.  
Subjects will be randomized by [CONTACT_63345] ( IWRS ) to receive 
13 doses of either Xlucane or Lucentis® in the study eye . The randomization scheme will 
automatically ensure that the study drug assignment for a given subject is random and that an overall 1:1 ratio of assignments to each of the 2 study drug treatments is 
approximated. In addition, the randomization scheme will  include the following 
stratification parameters to ensure balanced distribution of assignment to the 2 treatments: eye color (light iris vs dark iris), geographical region where enrolled and the BCVA letters at Baseline (55 or lower, 56 to 65, 66 or highe r). Subjects will be followed up for changes 
in efficacy variables and safety for [ADDRESS_68315]’s involvement will last up to 
approximately 52 weeks ( ie, 12 months). 
At the beginning of the study, a subgroup of [ADDRESS_68316] dose  of Xlucane or Lucentis
®. Additional sampl es will 
be collected at 23 hours (± 60 minutes) after the first dose (ie, Day 1) and at 23 hours (± 
60 minutes) after the sixth  dose (ie, W eek 20) at expected time to maximum plasma 
concentration (T max, which is around 22 hours).  
An interim analysis will be performed on unmasked  study data. After all of the 
randomized subjects have 6 -month (ie, 24 weeks) data available, an unmasked  analysis 
of efficacy and safety endpoints as well as PK and immunogenicity will be performed. The aim  of the unmasked analysis is to initiate the submission of the application for 
marketing authorization as agreed with the European Medicines Agency. 
This analys is will not affect the further conduct of the study. The site staff personnel will 
not receive details of patients’  individual treatment assignment  and therefore the blinding 
of patients ' individual treatment and thereby [CONTACT_63346].  FA, CFP, and OCT will be performed at Screening. The images will be sent to the central 
reading center  (CRC) for interpretation and confirmation of eligibility. The CRC will also 
grade images that are collected during the study.

Study Design  
 
Number of Subjects:  It is anticipated that approximately 580 subjects will be enrolled  and randomized .  
Treatment:  
Subjects will be randomiz ed in a 1:1 ratio to receive Lucentis
® (0.05 mL of 10 mg/mL 
ranibizumab), or the  proposed biosimilar, Xlucane (0.05 mL of 10 mg/mL 
ranibizumab), once every 4 weeks  (intravitreal injection) for 52 weeks (12 months).  
Subjects  will be randomized on Day 0. Only 1 eye (ie, the study eye) per subject  will 
receive Xlucane or Lucentis®. Subjects  will visit the site for  study assessment s after the 
first dose at Week 2  and every 4 weeks  thereafter, for a total of 52 weeks. (Subjects 
participating in the PK sub- study will need to visit the site more often [ie, at least two 
more times].) Week 52  will be the End of Treatment visit.

Statistical Analysis: 
For the primary estimand, the scientific question of interest is the between -group 
difference (Xlucane v Lucentis®) in the mean change from baseline in BCVA letter score 
at Week [ADDRESS_68319] no Intercurrent Events 
up to and including the Week 8 BCVA assessment and complete 8 weeks of treatment of study drug (given as a single ophthalmic IVT injection every 4 weeks/monthly). 
Before un mask ing the data for subjects included in this trial, a statistical analysis plan 
(SAP), which will provide the technical details of the statistical analyses outlined here, 
will be prepared, finalized , and signed. In general, data will be summari zed by [CONTACT_63355]. Continuous data will be presented as the number of observations, mean, standard deviation (SD), minimum, Q1, median, Q3, and maximum. Categorical 
data will be presented as counts and percentages. The data will be presented for each treatment group by [CONTACT_765]. 
Efficacy data  (ROW): Biosimilarity will be concluded if the two -sided 95 % confidence 
interval ( CI) for the difference in mean change in BCVA at Week 8 between the Xlucane 
and Lucentis
® is confined within the equivalence margin of ± 3.5 letters.

CONFIDENTIAL  Efficacy data (US FDA): Biosimilarity will be concluded if the two -sided 90% confidence 
interval (CI) for the difference in mean change in BCVA at Week 8 between the Xlucane 
and Lucentis® is confined within the equivalence margin of ± 3.5 letters.  
The difference in the approach around the confidence interval is based on the regulatory requirement in the United Sta tes (90% CI) and the rest of the world (95% CI) , as agreed 
with the relevant regulatory authorities . 
The change in BCVA letters at Week 8 compared to Baseline using the ETDRS protocol will be analyzed using a mixed m odel for r epeated measures (MMRM). An MMRM 
approach will be fitted with geographical region of the country where enrolled, visit, eye color (light iris vs dark iris), treatment, and treatment-by-vis it interaction as fixed effects, 
with the Baseline BCVA letters and Baseline BCVA letters -by-visit interaction as 
covariates. The treatment differences from the model at Week 8 will be evaluated and a 95% or 90% two -sided CI for the least square s mean difference between groups will be 
calculated. To prove the [ADDRESS_68320] to be within the equivalence margin of ±3.5 letters.  The primary analysis 
for assessment of biosimilarity will be based on the primary estimand.  
Interim analysis:  When all subjects have completed their [ADDRESS_68321] of the study.  
PK data: The PK data ( plasma levels of ranibizumab) will be compared between 2 groups 
of subjects receiving Xlucane and Lucentis
® in a statistical non -confirmatory manner, for 
comparative purpose.  
Safety data:  AEs will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA) and will be tabulated by s ystem organ c lass (SOC) and preferred t erm (PT).  
The total number of subjects with at least one TE AE and the total number of TEAEs will 
be presented. Number of subjects and number of TEAEs will be tabulated by [CONTACT_10666]. TEAEs will also be tabulated according to worst severity and relationship to 
treatment.  
Sample Size : The sample size calculation was based on the primary efficacy endpoint: 
Change in BCVA  between B aseline and Week 8.  
A 95% or 90% two -sided CI for the difference between groups will be calculated.  The 
difference in the approach around the confidence interval is based on the regulatory requirement in the [LOCATION_002] (90% CI) and the rest of the world (95% CI), as agreed 
with the relevant regulatory authorities . To prove the [ADDRESS_68322] to be within the equivalence  margin of ±3.[ADDRESS_68323], it is expected that 
a baseline BCVA of around 60 letters will be observed. Therefore, a n SD of 10 for the 
primary endpoint is well in the upper range of what is expected.  
From 580 randomized patients there will be > 90% power to show equivalence (ie, two-
sided 95% CI for the mean difference between Xlucane and Lucentis® is confined within 
the equivalence margin of ± 3.5 letters) if the SD is no more than 10.

CONFIDENTIAL  6 INTRODUCTION 
6.1 Background: Disease 
Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a common eye condition that has been 
described as the leading cause of vision loss, affecting 10%–13% of adults over 
[ADDRESS_68329] important for visual acuity (VA). It causes damage to the macula, increasingly affecting sharp, central vision over time. While AMD by [CONTACT_63356], the loss of central vision in AMD can interfere with simple everyday activities.
[ADDRESS_68330] likely occurring after age 60. Other risk factors include smoking, race, and family history and genetics.  
 Neovascula r AMD is a major cause of loss of central vision in the elderly. While it does 
not cause complete blindness, it can make daily activities such as driving and reading difficult or impossible. Disease activity in neovascular AMD is lifelong. Even at late stages in the therapeutic course, exudative AMD patients remain at risk for substantial additional visual decline. AMD is a disease of the photoreceptors and the retinal pi[INVESTIGATOR_1836] (RPE) . In the aging eye, Bruch’s membrane composition changes, 
RPE function diminishes, and drusen (containing lipofuscin and other toxic waste products of metabolism) is deposited. Vision loss results from the abnormal growth and leakage of blood vessels in the macula.  
 The main factor influencing AMD progression remains age, with genetics and smoking 
also having an impact . A meta -analysis of population-based AMD studies reported a 
global prevalence of 8.7% in people aged 45 to 85 years, with a higher prevalenc e in 
Europe and North America than in Asia.
3 The authors further predicted that the number 
of cases worldwide would increase from 170 million in 2014 to 196 million in 2020 and 288 million in 2040.   AMD is divided into “early,” “intermediate, ” and “late” types based on severity , with 
the late type being the most severe.
2 The late type can be further divided into the dry 
(atrophic) and the wet (ie, neovascular or exudative) forms. The dry form is less aggressive and accounts for 90% of all AMD cases but only for 10% of cases of blindness due to AMD. Dry AMD may develop into wet AMD. Wet AMD (wAMD) affects 10% of the AMD patients and is the more aggressive form, which, if untreated, leads to rapid severe visual impairment and in many cases, legal blindness.
1 However, 
80% to 90% of patients with severe vision loss due to AMD have wAMD.1  
 Wet AMD causes rupture of Bruch’s membrane, an associated locali zed inflammatory 
response, and release of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which induces choroidal neovascularisation (CNV). The newly formed blood vessels grow through the ruptured membrane underneath the RPE and the retina. The se new vessels are fragile 
and leak blood and proteins and may cause persistent edema below the macula, resulting in permanent damage to photoreceptors and the loss of central vision.

Treatment  of wAMD  includes photodynamic therapy (PDT) and laser coagulation, 
(although a recent Cochrane review found that laser coagulation is ineffective at preventing CNV and limiting loss of VA ).
[ADDRESS_68331] of care treatment for wAMD is intravitreal (IVT) anti-VEGF therapy, 
with the VEGF -antagonist pegaptanib (Macugen
®; Bausch + Lomb ) and the monoclonal 
antibody ranibizumab (Lucentis®; Genentech/[COMPANY_001]). Another anti- VEGF treatment 
for wAMD is aflib ercept (Eylea®; Regeneron), which  is a VEGF -trap that interferes 
with the biological actions by [CONTACT_63357]- A, preventing it from interacting with 
its receptors.  
 6.2 Xlucane  
Xbrane Biopharma AB (referred to as Xbrane) is developi[INVESTIGATOR_63322] a proposed biosimilar  candidate to the EU -licensed Lucentis
® (ranibizumab). Lucentis was first 
approved as a treatment for wAMD in the United S tates in 2006 and the European 
Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) in 2007.5 
 The active ingredient in Xlucane and Lucentis
® is ranibizumab. Ranibizumab belongs to 
the pharmacological class of VEGF inhibitors and is an antigen binding fragment (Fab) of a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody (rhuMAb) that binds to the receptor binding site of active forms of VEGF-A, including the biologically active, cleaved form of this molecule, VEGF
110. VEGF -A has been shown to cause neovascularization and 
leakage in models of ocular angiogenesis and vascular occlusion and is thought to contribute to pathophysiology of neovascular w AMD. T he binding of ranibizumab to 
VEGF -A prevents the interaction of VEGF-A with its receptors (VEGFR1 and 
VEGFR2) on the surface of endothelial cells, reducing endothelial cell proliferation, vascular leakage, and new blood vessel formation.
5  
 
Ranibizumab was originally developed from a murine monoclonal antibody produced 
using VEGF 165-immuniz ed mice.5 The variable light (VL) and variable heavy (VH) 
chain from the identified murine monoclonal antibody was fused to human constant light (CL) and human constant heavy (CH1) domains.
[ADDRESS_68332] 
for VEGF 165 was further optimized by [CONTACT_63358].6 Crystallographic studies show 
that the mature Fab fragment binds specifically to VEGF -A and that this interaction 
occurs at the residues Met81, Gln89, and Gly92 on VEGF- A.6,7 It should be noted that 
these residues are present in the 3 main VEGF -A isoforms in vivo (VEGF 121, VEGF 165, 
and VEGF 110) and that they are required for binding to the VEGF- A receptors (VEGFR -
1 and VEGFR- 2).6,[ADDRESS_68333] has a molecular weight (MW) of approximately 48 kDa; after reduction, both polypeptide chains can be detected separately (light chain 23 kDa and heavy chain 25 kDa).  6.2.1 Quality Development 
Xlucane has been developed with patented technology and deep knowledge and experience in protein production, resulting in a very high production yield—currently on average 8× what a standard system in E scherichia  coli (BL21) would result in. 
 The manufacturing process for ranibizumab in Xlucane has been developed in -house by 
[CONTACT_63359] (Stockholm, Sweden) . As with Lucentis
®, ranibizumab is produced in an E coli  
K-strain but with differences in the strain background and in the expression vector.  The formulation for Xlucane drug substance (DS) is being developed with a composition of 20 mg/mL ranibizumab, α,α -trehalose dihydrate, histidine hydrochloride 
monohydrate, histidine, polysorbate 20, and water for injection (WFI). All excipi[INVESTIGATOR_63323].  
 The formulation for Xlucane drug product (DP) is being developed to replicate that of Lucentis
® with a composition of 10 mg/mL ranibizumab, α,α -trehalose dihydrate, 
histidine hydrochloride monohydrate, histidine, polysorbate 20, and WFI. All excipi[INVESTIGATOR_63324].  
 Batches of Xlucane DS, produced at [ADDRESS_68334] been analyzed extensively for 
comparative physiochemical and functional similarity assessment studies. Biosimilarity  
between the Xlucane and Lucentis
® has been demonstrated in a stepwise procedure.   
 6.2.2 Summary of Nonclinical Development  
Physicochemical characterization of Xlucane and Lucentis
® was performed to enable 
comparison of the structural characteristics of the protein products (eg, the primary and higher order structures and protein variants). Functional in vitro assays representative of biological activity were part of the similarity a ssessment program. Protein and process 
related impurities were also characterized, quantified, and compared. 
The methods used for the characterization of Xlucane were chosen to provide a 
thorough understanding of the similarity and potential differences be tween Lucentis
® 
and Xlucane.  In addition to the batches used, isolates from different purification steps 
were also used in initial studies for optimization of the analytical methods. Using these 
extra isolates, different forms of the target molecule were d etected, further supporting 
the sensitivity of the methods used .

CONFIDENTIAL  Extensive analyses show that the produced Xlucane lots and the analyzed Lucentis® 
batches were similar for the tests performed. Some analytical tests are ongoing and 
results are pending. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Primary and Higher Order Structures 
The amino acid sequence of Xlucane was analyzed by [CONTACT_60628]- tandem 
mass spectrometry (LC -MS) on protease degraded material , and was shown to be 
identical to that of Lucentis®. The primary structure for Lucentis® and Xlucane was 
analyzed using reduced/non-reduced conditions in combination with LC- MS for intact 
mass of the full F ab or for the individual subunits confirming expected mass in all 
samples tested.  C-terminal sequence for light chain and heavy chain was confirmed in 
both Xlucane and Lucentis® using LC- MS/MS. Overall , the primary structure in 
Xlucane DS and DP is similar to the primary structure of Lucentis®.  
Secondary and tertiary structure for Lucentis® and Xlucane material was analyzed and  
used to characterize the higher order structure. Overall methods showed that the higher 
order structure of Xlucane is similar to the higher order structure of Lucentis®. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Purity/Impurity  Profile  
Purity and impurities such as high molecular weight species, fragments, oxidized, 
deamidated, gluconoylated, pyroglutamated species were analyzed by [CONTACT_63360] ( HPLC ), reversed phase HPLC, ion exchange 
HPLC, analy tical ultra -centrifugation, reducing/non-reducing capi[INVESTIGATOR_63325] (cGE ), capi[INVESTIGATOR_12863] (cIEF) , and LC -MS. All methods 
showed that Xlucane and Lucentis
® have a similar purity/impurity profile.  
Process -related impurities such as host cell DNA, bacterial endotoxin , and s terility were 
analy zed by [CONTACT_937]- PCR, LAL assay ( Ph. Eur. 2.6.14, USP <85>), and membrane filtration 
(Ph. Eur. 2.6.1, USP <71> ). Host cell DNA specifications ha ve been set based on 
industry standards (there are no pharmacopoeial standards), and all results are below 
this limit. All other methods showed that Xlucane are within the specifications of EU and US Pharmacopoeial standards.  
 Host cell proteins (HCPs) have been analyzed with commercially available K12 HCP  
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) kits. The method shows that levels of 
HCPs  are within the specifications of industry standards (there are no pharmacopoeial 
standards). Xbrane is currently developi [INVESTIGATOR_007] a specific HCP  ELISA kit for the used 
process , and all clinical batches will be analy zed with this method prior to the start of 
the trial. Subvisible particles were also measured for Xlucane DP material , and the 
amount of subvisible particles is within the specifications of US Pharmacop oeial  
standards ( USP <789>). Xbrane is currently developi[INVESTIGATOR_63326] L from the first purification step. All clinical batches will be analy zed with 
this method prior to the start of the trial.

CONFIDENTIAL  [IP_ADDRESS] Potency and Binding  
Xbrane has  conduct ed surface plasmon resonance ( SPR/BIAcore ) and  HEK293 reporter 
gene assay  (RGA)  with Xlucane and Lucentis® to evaluate potential differences in the 
content and functionality of ranibizumab. The HEK293/RGA will  continue to be used in 
lot release and stability testing, and SPR/BIAcore will also be used for extended 
characterization.  
Xlucane has been investigated for its binding capacity to VEGF 165, VEGF 110, VEGF 121 
and VEGF 189 and compared to that of Lucentis®. Specific interaction with VEGF -A is 
crucial for the action of Lucentis® and Xlucane and this mechanism of action (MoA) 
has been examined using BIAcore. BIAcore was used to provide quantitative data on the association rat e constant for the binding of ranibizumab to each of the VEGF 
variants ( VEGF
165, VEGF 110, VEGF 121 and VEGF 189). Xbrane has demonstrated that the 
binding characteristics of Xlucane to VEGF 165, VEGF 110, VEGF 121 and VEGF 189 by 
[CONTACT_63361] /BIAcore are comparable to that of Lucentis®.  
 The HEK293/ RGA assay  was also used to assess similarity with respect to potency 
between batches of Xlucane DS  and Xlucane DP, formulated as described in Section  
6.2.1, and Lucentis
® batches. The RGA was used to represent a relevant signal 
transduction pathway ( VEGF 165, VEGF 110, VEGF 121 and VEGF 189). The interaction 
between VEGF 165, VEGF 110, VEGF 121 and VEGF 189 and the VEGF- AR2 (KDR) 
receptor in HEK293 cells (GloResponse™ Cell Line) was quantified. Results from the RGA show that the potency is similar for Xlucane and Lucentis for all isoforms . The 
assay has been fully validated for VEGF
165 and qualified for all other isoforms. 
 [IP_ADDRESS] Pharmacokinetic Study  in Rabbits  
In addition, to support the development of Xlucane for registration in India and Japan as well as other regions such as China, an in vivo pharmacokinetic ( PK) study was 
conducted in New Zealand White rabbits (data on file; forthcoming).
9 The main 
objective of th e study was to compare t he PK characteristics of 2 formulations of 
ranibizumab (biosimilar [Xlucane] and Lucentis®) at a dose level of 0.5 mg (per eye)  
following a single bilat eral intravitreal injection.  The study design is shown in Table 1.

During the course of the study, the animals were monitored for mortality/moribundity, 
abnormal clinical signs, inappetence, body weights, ophthalmology, and electroretinograms  (ERGs). Serum and ocular tissues were collected for measurement of 
ranibizumab concentration and pharmacokinetics. At scheduled termination, ocular tissues (right eye) were collected from microscopic evaluation. 
There was no mortality during the course of the study. There were no abnormal clinical 
signs/appetence nor changes in the body weights/body weight gains or ERG parameters that could be attributed to a single bilateral IVT of biosimilar Xlucane or Lucentis
® at 
dose level of 0.5 mg/eye. Ocular changes attributed to the administration of Lucentis® 
were limited to a transient inflammation of the anterior chamber in 2/16 eyes (2/8 animals) on Day 14. By [CONTACT_2006] 28, signs of anterior uveitis were not observed in any of the 4 surviving animals, but changes in the posterior segment, notably the presence of cell-like opacities in the anterior portion of the vitreous, and deeper, larger vitreal 
opacities were present in 1/8 Lucentis
®-treated animals (both eyes ). The administration 
of Xlucane was well tolerated, with no ocular inflammation observed in any of the eyes treated.   
A comparable exposure (C
max and AUC (0-t)) in serum and ocular tissues was observed in 
animals that received Xlucane compared to Lucentis®. Tmax was generally observed at 
the last time point collected (24  hours postdose) or at the last quantifiable value 
(48 hours postdose) for serum. T max was observed at 24 hours postdose in ocular tissues 
(vitreous humour and sensory retina). At [ADDRESS_68335] exposure (C max 
and AUC (0-t)) was found in vitreous humor, followed by [CONTACT_63362]. When estimated for vitreous humor, the T 1/2 was 71.9 hours for Lucentis® and 
72.4 hours for Xlucane.   
Microscopic changes of the right eye of animals treated with Xlucane or Lucentis® were 
limited to mononuclear cell infiltration. The incidence and severity of this change was generally higher in the Lucentis
® group (minimal to moderate severity; 7 ocular tissues 
affec ted) when compared to the Xlucane group (minimal severity; 3 ocular tissues 
affected).   
In conclusion, a single bilateral IVT injection of 1 of 2 formulations of ranibizumab  
(biosimilar Xlucane or Lucentis®) to New Zealand white rabbits was well tolerated ,

Xlucane has not yet been tested in any clinical study. The planned clinical development includes this  pi[INVESTIGATOR_63327], equivalence, PK , 
immunogenicity, and safety  of Xlucane and Lucentis
®. The clinical study is planned to 
be conducted in the EU, US, APAC , and other regions to confirm the biosimilarity  of 
Xlucane to Lucentis®.  
 The clinical phase III study is a double-blind (double- masked ), multicente r, parallel 
group study in patients with wAMD. The patients will be randomiz ed 1:1 to receive 
Lucentis
® or Xlucane. The patients will receive 13 doses of Xlucane or Lucentis® and 
be followed for changes in efficacy and safety for [ADDRESS_68336] corrected visual acuity ( BCVA ) letters at Week 8 compared to Baseline 
using the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study ( ETDRS ) protocol. 
Approximately 580 patients will be randomized in the study. Refer also to Section 8.2 
of the protocol for study design discussion. 
Immunogenicity will be evaluated by [CONTACT_14181]-drug antibody (ADA) formation and 
neutrali zing anti-drug antibody (NAb) up to W eek 52 after Randomization. An 
electrochemiluminescence (ECL) bridging assay format that uses labelled (biotinylated and ruthenylated) Xlucane will be employed for screening, with confirmatory and titration tiers for ADA performed. The characterization of NAb will be performed using a Competitive Ligand Binding Assay format (CLBA) that will measure the capacity of the test samples to inhibit binding of Xlucane to biotinylated VEGF-165 immobilized on streptavidin- coated plates.  
A PK substudy is incorporated in the proposed phase III c linical trial to permit an 
assessment for similarity in systemic exposure following Xlucane and Lucentis
® 
administration. It is anticipated that the systemic exposure should be low, given the dose and route of administration. Between approximately [ADDRESS_68337] dose (Day 1), and at  23 hours after the sixth dose 
(Week  20); T
max is around 22 hours.

retinopathy (DR); and myopic CNV (mCNV). The active substance of Lucentis® is 
ranibizumab, a monoclonal antibody fragment.5  
The mo de of action of ranibizumab is to bind to the vascular endothelial growth factor 
A (VEGF -A) present in  the eyes of the affected patients. VEGF -A has been shown to 
cause neovascularization and leakage in models of ocular angiogenesis and vascular 
occlusion and is thought to contribute to pathophysiology of neovascular AMD, mCNV, DR, DME and macular edema following RVO. The binding of ranibizumab to VEGF- A 
prevents the interaction of VEGF-A with its receptors (VEGFR1 and VEGFR2) on the surface of endothelial cells, reducing endothelial cell proliferation, vascular leakage, and new blood vessel formation. 
Ranibizumab, which lacks an Fc region, has a molecular weight of approximately [ADDRESS_68338] not been conducted to determine the carcinogenic potential of 
ranibizumab. Based on the anti- VEGF mechanis m of action of ranibizumab, treatment 
with Lucentis
® may pose a risk to reproductive capacity. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Infertility  
No studies on the effects of ranibizumab on fertility have been conducted and it is not known whether ranibizumab can affect reproduction capacity. B ased on the anti -VEGF 
mechanism of action for ranibizumab, treatment with Lucentis ® may pose a risk to 
reproductive capacity.  
 
6.3.2 Clinical Studies in wAMD  
The safety and efficacy of Lucentis ® were assessed in three randomized, double-
masked, sham- or active-controlled studies in patients with wAMD. A total of 1323 
patients (Lucentis ® 879, control 444) were enrolled in the three studies.  
In studies AMD -[ADDRESS_68339] all Lucentis

DA for the control arms.  
In study AMD-3, the primary efficacy endpoint was the mean change in visual acuity at 12 months compared with Baseline. Visual acuity was measured at a distance of 4 meters. After an initial increase in visual acuity (following monthly dosing), on average, patients dosed once every 3 months with Lucentis
® lost visual acuity, returning to 
Baseline at Month 12. In study AMD- 3, almost all Lucentis®-treated patients (90%) lost 
fewer than 15 letters of visual acuity at Month 12. 
In study AMD-4, clinical results at Month 24 remain similar to that observed at Month 
12. From Month 3 through Month 24, visual acuity decreased by 0.3 letters in the 0.5 mg less frequent dosing arm and increased by 0.7 letters in the 0.5 mg monthly arm. Visual acuity was measured at a distance of 4 meters.

Subjects will be randomized by [CONTACT_63345] ( IWRS ) to receive 
13 doses of either Xlucane or Lucentis® in the study eye. The randomization scheme 
will automatically ensure that the study drug assignment for a given subject is random and that an overall 1:1 ratio of assignments to each of the 2 study drug treatments is approximated. In addition, the randomization scheme will include the following 
stratification parameters to ensure balanced distribution of assignment to the 2 treatments: eye color (light iris vs dark iris), geographical region where enrolled and the BCVA l etters at Baseline  (55 or lower, 56 to 65, 66 or higher). Subjects will be 
followed up for changes in efficacy variables and safety for [ADDRESS_68341]’s involvement will last up to approximately 52 weeks (ie, 12 months). 
At the beginning of the study, a subgroup of between approximately [ADDRESS_68342] dose  
of Xlucane or Lucentis
®. Additional samples will be collected  [ADDRESS_68343] 
dose (ie, Day 1) and 23 hours after the sixth  dose (ie, W eek 20) at expected time to 
maximum plasma concentration ( Tmax, which is around 22 hours). The primary analysis 
set will be the Per -Protocol population. 
An interim analysis will be performed on unmasked  study data. After all of the 
randomized subjects have 6 -month (ie, 24 weeks) data available, an unmasked  analysis 
of efficacy and safety endpoints as well as PK and immunogenicity will be performed. 
The aim of the unmasked analysis is to initiate the submission  of the application for 
marketing authorization as agreed with the European Medicines Agency. This  analys is 
will not affect the further conduct of the study.

CONFIDENTIAL  8.2 Discussion of Study Design  
8.2.1 Study Desi gn 
The objectives of this study are to demonstrate the equivalence11 of Xlucane to 
Lucentis® and to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Xlucane as compared to Lucentis® 
(ranibizumab  injection ). This will be done through a multicente r, randomized, double-
blind (double- masked ), parallel  group study. The rationale for the design of this trial is 
to appropriately evaluate Xlucane as compared to Lucentis®, the reference standard 
for wAMD.  
The selected endpoints for demonstrating equivalence of Xlucane to Lucentis® are in 
accordance with current standards, as are the safety endpoints of the trial. Mask ing 
subjects  and designated study team members to the treatment assignment(s) ensures 
objectivity and minimizes bias. Randomization through the IWRS  guards against 
selection bias.  
The selected dosing schedule of the 2 study drugs is based upon clinical studies with 
Lucentis®, whereby [CONTACT_63373] a cuity and  to result 
in an additional average 1 to 2 letter gain. Furthermore, prespecified safety evaluations will monitor subjects for any adverse events and injection site  reactions (ISRs) during 
and after treatment.  
Biosimilarity will be concluded if th e two -sided 90% (US FDA) or 95% (ROW) 
confidence interval (CI) for the difference in mean change in BCVA at Week 8 between the Xlucane and Lucentis
® is confined within the equivalence margin of ± 3.5 letters. The 
difference in the approach around the confidence interval is based on the regulatory requirement in [LOCATION_002] (90% CI) and the rest of the world (95% CI), as agreed with the relevant regu latory authorities .

An equivalence margin of  ±3.[ADDRESS_68353]  55% of the lower limit of the 
95% confidence interval of treatment benefit ( 7.7 letters) demonstrated above. 
Considering this and that the minimal clinically important difference in VA has 
previously been set to or estimated to be 5 to 10 letters,12,13,14 an equivalence margin of 
±3.5 letters is deemed adequate and supported by [CONTACT_16096]/FDA in recent scientific advice. 
As the primary objective of the study is to demonstrate equivalence of Xlucane versus 
Lucentis®, a symmetrical equivalence region of ±3.5 letters will be used. Biosimilarity 
will be concluded if the two-sided 95% or 90% CI for the difference between Xlucane and Lucentis in  the BCVA change from Baseline at Week 8 is confined within the 
equivalence margin of ± 3.[ADDRESS_68354] any notable differences in plasma ranibizumab levels between the 2 products, Xlucane and Lucentis
®. Systemic ranibizumab exposure is very 
low after IVT injection , and there are potential issues in detecting such low levels by [CONTACT_63374] . Further considering the approach that any notable differences are more easily 
detectable at steady -state, when ranibizumab  concentrations are higher ( ie, near  the 
expected T max after dos ing, which is around 22 hours ), the current study has PK 
measurements at Baseline, Day 1 (23 hours [± 60 minutes] after the first dose),  and at 
Week 20 (23 hours [± 60 minutes] after the sixth  dose) to possibly detect any 
differences in peak systemic exposure between the 2 produc ts. 
The rationale for the design of this trial is to appropriately evaluate Xlucane  as 
compared to Lucentis®, the current  standard of care for wAMD. The clinical relevance

Lucentis® clinical studies, VA was measured at a distance of 4  meters  (or less) relative 
to ETDRS . Increased retinal thickness (ie, CFT) and l eakage from CNV are  well 
associated with w AMD. All are common causes of severe vision loss and thus changes 
in these measures can be considered objective endpoint evaluations for wAMD.  
Refer also to Section 6.[ADDRESS_68355],  and Asia -Pacific . 
Refer  also to the statistical considerations in Section  11.4, on which the numbers 
are based .  
Rescreening will be allowed for subjects previously determined as screen failures due to 
inclusion and/or exclusion criteria that could transiently change and do not compromise 
the subjec t’s safety. Only one rescreen will be allowed per subject . When a rescreen is 
authorized by [CONTACT_4885], the subject  is to be re consented , and all 
screening procedures (ie, laboratory testing, OCT, and color fundus photography [CFP] ) 
should be repeated/completed and provided to the CRC, with the exception of the FA  
procedure. Based on the CRC’s  determination, screening FA may not need to be 
repeated . Thus, if the CRC deems it appropriate/acceptable, prior FA performed at 
the time of the screen failure, may therefore  be used  for eligibility assessment . 
However if more than [ADDRESS_68356] satisfy all  of the following inclusion 
criteria:  
1. Written and signed informed consent form obtained at Screening before any study-
related procedures  are performed . Patients must be capable of providing their own 
consent (an impartial witness must be present in case of illiterate patients).  
2. Willingness and ability to undertake all scheduled visits and assessments as judged by [CONTACT_093].

Visit 6 (Week 12)  to Visit 16 (Week 52) allow a -5 day window, therefore the 
minimum interval between two consecutive injections between these visits can be 23 days.  
If a visit is outside the protocol defined visit window, should be considered as ‘Late 
Visit or Out Of Window visit’ and must be entered in the CRF as a protocol deviation (PD). Visits that are delayed for more than 14 days from the scheduled visit date, should be considered as ‘missed’ visits. The next visit should be scheduled in consideration of the protocol defined interval as much as possible and as per medical judgement of the investigator. 
The study is expected to complete no later than one year or 12 months (+7 days) from 
the date of the last patient randomized into the study. This will be considered as the study end date and will be communicated once the last patient has been randomized. 
Patient visits should be scheduled as per the protocol and within stipulated visit 
windows to ensure all patients complete the study and have the EOT (Visit 16) scheduled within the study end date.  
If due to any reason it is not possible to complete all remaining visits for any patient 
within the s tudy end date, an early termination visit must be scheduled and EOT 
procedures completed as per Section 8.1.[ADDRESS_68368] caps/stoppers of differing colors and length; however, they will be packaged and labeled in identical outer cartons. Therefore, s ites must have 
the following unmasked team members and their designated back -ups:

unmasked injector,  and complete study drug accountability . 
• Unmasked i njector to perform injection and safety assessments immediately after 
the injections (but not to  participat e in the efficacy assessments).

During the study, subjects may not  receive any standard or investigational agents for 
treatment of their AMD in the study eye other than study treatment until they have completed the final or early termination visit assessments.  This includes medications 
administered locally (eg, IVT by [CONTACT_63389]), as well as those administered systemically with the intent of treating the fellow eye. Vitamins and dietary supplements are allowed. 
In case the fellow eye develops AMD or other medical condition during the study, it is 
expected that the fellow eye may be treated locally (eg, IVT by [CONTACT_63389]), with standard of care therapy per local clinical practice first.  
If anti -VEGF therapy is necessary, it is recommended to start it no earlier than after the 
last PK assessment and to perform the fellow eye IVT procedures in the interval 
between the study drug injections.

8.4.9 Warnings and Precautions 
Subjects should be monitored prior to and following each injection (for at least 60 minutes) to permit any early treatment and appropriate management if needed.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Endophthalmitis and Retinal Detachments  
IVT injections, including those with Lucentis
®, have been associated with 
endophthalmitis and retinal detachments. Proper aseptic injection technique should always be used when administering study medication. In addition, patients should be monitored following the injection to permit early treatment should an infection occur. 
Subjects should also be advised that in the days following study medication 
administration, they are at risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_63332]. If the eye becomes red, sensitive to light, painful, or develops a change in vision, advise the subject to seek immediate care from the loc al investigator (ie, an ophthalmologist ).

CONFIDENTIAL  [IP_ADDRESS] Increases in Intraocular Pressure  
Increases in IOP have been noted both before and after injection (at 60 minutes) while 
being treated with Lucentis®. Monitor IOP  prior to and following IVT injection with 
study medication and manage appropriately. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Thromboembolic Events 
Although there was a low rate of arterial thromboembolic events (ATEs) observed in 
the Lucentis® clinical trials, there is a potential risk of ATEs following IVT use of 
VEGF in hibitors. Arterial thromboembolic events are defined as nonfatal stroke, 
nonfatal myocardial infarction, or vascular death (including deaths of unknown cause). 
The ATE rate in the 3 controlled wAMD studies (AMD-1, AMD-2, and AMD -3) during 
the first year was 1.9% (17 of 874) in the combined group of patients treated with 
0.3 mg or 0.5 mg Lucentis® compared with 1.1% (5 of 441) in patients from the control 
arms. In the second year of studies AMD-1 and AMD-2, the ATE rate was 2.6% (19 of 721) in the combined group of Lucentis
®-treated patients compared with 2.9% (10 of 
344) in patients from the control arms. In study AMD-4, the ATE rates observed in the 0.[ADDRESS_68372] and second year were similar to rates observed in studies AMD-1, AMD-2, and AMD-3.  
In a pooled analysis of 2-year controlled studies ( AMD-1, AMD-2, and a study of 
Lucentis
® used adjunctively with verteporfin photodynamic therapy [ PDT ), the stroke 
rate (including both ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke) was 2.7% (13 of 484) in patients 
treated with 0.5 mg Lucentis® compared to 1.1% (5 of 435) in patients in the control 
arms (odds ratio: 2.2 [ 95% CI: 0.8,7.1]). 
 8.4.10 Treatment C ompliance 
All study drug doses will be administered by [CONTACT_63390].  
As study drug is administered in the clinic, treatment compliance will be overseen and 
documented by [CONTACT_63391] (and drug 
accountability records). At a minimum, date, time, and dose should be accurately recorded in real-time to confirm that each dose of study treatment was administered per the protocol.

Subjects should be monitored onsite prior to and following each injection ( for at least 
60 minutes) to permit any  early treatment and appropriate management  if needed . 
Investigators may use their clinical judgement to determine if any additional IOP lowering medications or any unscheduled assessments may be needed during the study. 
Subjects should also be advised that in the days following study medication 
administration, they are at risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_63332]. If the eye becomes red, sensitive to light, painful, or develops a change in vision, advise the subject to seek immediate care fr om the study doctor or an ophthalmologist.

[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events  
Adverse Event D efinition  
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study subject administered a medicinal product which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not it is related to the 
medicinal (investigational) product. This includes an exacerbation of pre- existing 
conditions or events, intercurrent illnesses, drug interaction, or the significant worsening of the indication under investigation that is not recorded elsewhere in the eCRF under specific efficacy assessments . Anticipated fluctuations of pre-existing conditions, 
including the disease under study, that do not represent a clinically signifi cant 
exacerbation or worsening need not be considered AEs. 
It is the responsibility of the investigator to document all AEs that occur during the 
study. AEs will be elicited by [CONTACT_63397] a nonleading question, for example, “Have you experienced an y new or changed symptoms since we last asked/since your 
last visit?”  AEs should be reported on the appropriate page of the e CRF.

CONFIDENTIAL  Assessment of S everity  
Each AE will be assigned a category by [CONTACT_3470]: 
Mild : An AE that is easily tolerated by [CONTACT_423], causes minimal discomfort , 
and does not interfere with everyday activities.  
Moderate : An AE that is sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal 
everyday activities; intervention may be needed.  
Severe : An AE that prevents  normal everyday activities; treatment or other 
intervention usually needed.  
If there is a change in severity of an AE, it must be recorded as a separate event.  
Assessment of Causality 
Every effort will be made by [CONTACT_63398], if any, 
to the study drug. Causality should be assessed using the categories presented in the following table: 
Unrelated : Clinical event with an incompatible time relationship to study drug  
administration, and that could be explained by [CONTACT_63399]. 
Related : Clinical event with plausible t ime relationship to study drug  
administration, and that cannot be explained by [CONTACT_63400].  
Action Taken  
The investigator will describe the action taken with the study treatment in the 
appropriate section of the eCRF, as follows: 
• Dose not changed 
• Study drug permanently withdrawn  
• Study drug temporarily interrupted 
• Not applicable 
• Unknown 
 
Other S pecific T reatment of A dverse E vents  
The investigator will describe the other treatment(s) for the AE/SAE in the appropriate 
section of the eCRF, as follows:

Follow- up of A dverse E vents  
All investigators should follow up with  subjects with AEs until the event is resolved or 
until, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], the event is stabil ized or determined to be 
chronic. Details of AE resolution must be documented in the e CRF.  
Subjects should be followed up for 28 days  (± 5 days) after receiving the last dose of 
study drug, and any AEs that occur during this time should be reported according to the 
procedures outlined above. 
Documentation and Reporting of A dverse E vents  
AEs should be reported and documented in accordance with the procedures outlined 
below. All AEs occurring during the study (from the time of receiving written informed 
consent to 28 days [± 5 days] of receiving last dose of study drug) must be documented on the relevant e CRF pages . The following data should be documented for each AE: 
• Descript ion of the symptom event 
• Classification of “serious” or “not serious” 
• Severity  
• Date of first occurrence and dat e of resolution (if applicable) 
• Action taken  
• Causal relationship  
• Outcome of event (unknown, recovered, not yet recovered, recovered with 
sequelae, death [with date and cause reported]) 
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_68402] that, at any dose, 
• Results in  death.  
• Is life -threatening (an AE is life -threatening if the subject was at immediate risk of 
death from the event as it occurred, ie, it does not include a reaction that might have caused death if it had occurred in a more serious form). 
• Requires or prolongs inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] . (Complications occurring during 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_63335] [ are] SAEs if they cause prolongation of the current 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] . Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_63336] a pre-existing

In addition, medical and scientific judgement is required to decide if prompt notification is required in situations other than those defined for SAEs above. This may include any event that the investigator regards as serious that did not strictly meet the criteria above but may have jeopardize d the subject or required intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed above, or that would suggest any significant hazard, contraindication, side effect , or precaution that may be associated with the use of the investigational 
product. 
Reporting of S erious A dverse E vents 
Any SAE must be reported by [CONTACT_63401], from 
the time of receiving written informed consent to 28 days (± 5 days) of receiving last dose of study drug, whether or not the SAE is considered to be related to the investigational product. All SAEs must be reported by [CONTACT_19452] [ADDRESS_68403] at: 
Fax No.: 001-[PHONE_1188] e-mail: [EMAIL_1247] 
The investigator should not wait to receive additional information to document fully the event before notification of an SAE, though additional information may be requested. Where applicable, information from relevant laboratory results, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_63337], and autopsy reports should be obtained. 
Instances of death, conge nital abnormality , or an event that is of such clinical concern as 
to influence the overall assessment of safety, if brought to the attention of the 
investigator at any time after cessation of study drug administration and linked by [CONTACT_63402], should be reported to the study monitor.

11 STATISTICAL METHODS  
11.1 General Considerations  
Before unmasking the data for subjects included in this trial for the interim analysis, a 
statistical analysis plan (SAP), which will provide the technical details of the statistical analyses outlined here, will be prepared, finalized, and signed.   
In general, data will be summarized by [CONTACT_63408]. Continuous data 
will be presented  as the number of observations, mean, standard deviation (SD), 
minimum, Q1, median, Q3, and maximum. Categorical data will be presented as counts and percentages. The data will be presented for each treatment group by [CONTACT_765]. All data summarized will be presented in patient listings.  
11.[ADDRESS_68408] of all patients enrolled in the study, ie , all patients who 
signed the informed consent form . This set will be used for summaries of disposition for 
all patients enrolled.  
The Full Analysis Set (FAS)  will include all patients for whom treatment regimen has 
been assigned. The FAS will be used for all analyses of efficacy endpoints. Patients  will 
be analyzed according to the randomized treatment. Different strategies will be applied for handling data following interc urrent events (IE) (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]). Unless stated 
otherwise, all subject listings will be presented using this  set. 
The Safety Set (SS) will include all patients who receive at least 1 dose of study drug. Patients will be analyzed according to treatment received. The SS will be used for analyses of safety endpoints.  The Pharmacokinetic Set (PKS)  will include patients in the SS who have a t least [ADDRESS_68409] plasma level , the identified concentration values will be flagged as non- evaluable 
and excluded from the analyses.   A blinded data review meeting (BDRM) will be held prior to database lock and unblinding of the interim analysis to agree upon the PKS , PK samples/parameters to be 
included in the analyses, and any data to be excluded from the FAS analyses due to IEs. 
All patients for whom data were impacted due to the COVID-[ADDRESS_68410] the efficacy results . Attendees will include appropriate individuals 
from the Sponsor and Syneos Health. Details regarding the data to be reviewed at the 
meeting will be documented in the SA P and a separate BDRM plan.  
 11.3 Planned Analyses  
11.3.1 Patient Disposition  
Screen failures (with reasons), randomization , and dosing with study drug will be 
summarized for the Enrolled Set.  
Study completion and early termination (with reasons) as well as attendance at each 
visit will be summarized for the FAS.   
Inclusion in each analysis set will be summarized, along with reasons for exclusion.   11.3.2 Demographic and Other Baseline Characteristics  
Demographics and key baseline characteristics will be summarized.  
11.3.3 Effic acy Endpoints  
[IP_ADDRESS] Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
The primary endpoint of the study is the change in BCVA letters at Week 8 compared to 
Baseline using the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) protocol for the study eye.  Due to the increase in protocol deviations related to the COVID-19 pandemic and following the recent ICH E9 (R1) Addendum
19, the primary and secondary estimands of 
the study related to efficacy are detailed in this section. These estimands were not explicitly defined in earlier versions of the protocol (see S ection 18) but the estimand 
framework provides a more comprehensive approach to show the impact of Covid-19 in the analysis
20. The presence of such IEs in a biosimilarity study may introduce potential 
bias and a dilution of treatment differences (i.e. increasing the chance of proving equivalence), as such the ordering of the estimands described below (in terms of primary and secondary) are chosen.  
For the primary estimand, the scientific question of interest is the between -group 
difference (Xlucane v Lucentis
®) in the mean change from baseline in BCVA letter 
score at  Week [ADDRESS_68411] no IEs up to and 
including the Week 8 BCVA assessment and complete 8 weeks of treatment of study 
drug (given as a single ophthalmic IVT injection every 4 weeks/monthly).  IEs are defined as:

XBR1001                                                            Amendment 5  Version  1 Page  74 of 88                                                                                                   
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  • Early discontinuation of study treatment. Subsequent missing data (missing or 
collected) will be imputed in the analysis with a hypothetical strategy.  
• Non-adherence with the protocol which would potentially affect the efficacy results. 
Such identified data at the BDRM  (missing or collected) will be imputed in the 
analysis with a hypothetical strategy. 
• Start of anti-VEGF treatment in the fellow eye. Subsequent data (missing or collected) will be imputed in the analysis with a hypothetical strategy.  
  
The secondary estimand of the study for the primary endpoint will use alternate methods of handling data following IEs compared to the primary estimand. This approach will use a treatment policy with respect to IEs such that any data collected following the IE will be used in the analysis. So the scientific question of interest is the between -group difference (Xlucane v Lucentis
®) in the mean change from baseline in 
BCVA letter score at Week 8 in patients who fulfil the study eligibility criteria and complete 8 weeks of treatment of study drug, regardless of any other IEs. However, because the study design does not plan for assessments following early treatment discontinuation, a true treatment policy strategy is not possible to apply. As such, any missing data following early treatment discontinuation will be imputed using a 
hypothetical strategy.  Assumptions for imputing missing data due to IEs and analysis methods for each estimand are detailed in S ection  11.3.7. 
 The change in BCVA letters at Week 8 compared to Baseline using the ETDRS protocol will be analyzed using a mixed model for r epeated m easures  (MMRM) . An 
MMRM approach will be fitted with geographical region of the country where enrolled, visit, eye color (light iris vs dark iris), treatment, and treatment -by-visit interaction as 
fixed effects, with the baseline BCVA letters and baseline BCVA letters -by-visit 
interaction as covariates. The treatment differences from the model at Week 8 will be evaluated and a 95% or 90% two -sided CI for the least squares mean difference between 
groups will be calculated. To prove the [ADDRESS_68412] to be within the equivalence margin of ± 3.5 letters  for the 
primary estimand . The secondary estimand analysis will be supportive of the primary 
estimand analysis.  
 [IP_ADDRESS] Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  
The same properties of the primary and secondary estimand of the primary endpoint will be considered for each of the secondary endpoints. For responder analyses, the between-group difference in proportions (Xlucane v Lucentis
®) will be of interest.   
The following continuous secondary endpoints will be analy zed in a similar fashion to 
the primary efficacy endpoint:

CONFIDENTIAL  For the primary analysis of each  endpoint /estimand , a missing at random (MAR)  
approach will be assumed for missing data (ie, the probability of an observation being 
missing depends only on observed measurements). Sensitivity analyses will be conducted using different missing data assumptions such as missing not at random (MNAR)  and missing completely at random (MCAR) within each endpoint /estimand.  
For continuous endpoints, a MMRM model will be used (using only evaluable data)  to 
adopt a MAR  assumption for the primary analysis. Patients with missing data at a 
particular time  point still contribute to the analysis  at that time  point based on their other 
observed data used in the MMRM (ie, visit, treatment, baseline BCVA letter score , 
geographical region of the country where enrolled, eye color (light iris vs dark iris), and BCVA letter score at other visits) and the known covariance structures between these 
factors.  The sensitivity analyses will use alternate methods (to be detailed in the SAP) 
of imputing missing data such as multiple imputation with pattern mixture modelling and using evaluable data only . ANCOVA models will be used to analyze such data at 
the respe ctive visit.  
For non-continuous endpoints, alternate methods will be specified in the SAP to impute missing data, although the same mechanisms will be assumed as for continuous endpoints (ie, primary analysis assumes MAR, sensitivity analyses to assess MNA R and 
MCAR).  
Due to the indication under evaluation in this study, it is considered that most missing data due to COVID-19 can be treated as MAR, but this will be evaluated and agreed at the BDRM.  Additional subgroup and sensitivity analyses relating to the potential bias 
from missing data and/or deviations from the protocol during the COVID-[ADDRESS_68414], it is 
expected that a baseline BCVA of around 60 letters will be observed. Therefore, an SD  
of 10 for the primary endpoint is well in the upper range of what is expected.

CONFIDENTIAL  13 RECORDS AND SUPPLIES  
13.1 Drug Accountability  
On receipt of the study drug, the investigator (or designee) will conduct an inventory of 
the supplies and verify that study drug supplies are received intact and in the correct amounts before  completing  a supplies receipt . The investigator will retain a copy of this 
receipt at the study center and return the original receipt to the unmasked study monitor. 
The unmasked monitor may check the study supplies at each study center  at any time 
during the study. 
It is the responsibility of the unmasked study monitor to ensure that the investigator (or 
designee ) has correctly documented the amount of study drug received, dispensed, and 
returned on the dispensing log that will be provided. A full drug accountability log will be maintained at the  study cen ter at all times . The study monitor will also perform an 
inventory of study drug at the close -out visit to the study center . All discrepancies must 
be accounted for and documented. 
13.[ADDRESS_68418]  
Before initiation of the study at each study center , the protocol, the ICF, other written 
materia l given to the subjects, and any other relevant study documentation will be 
submitted to the appropriate IEC/ IRB. Written approval of the study and all relevant 
study information must be obtained before the study center  can be initiated or the study 
drug i s released to the investigator . Any necessary extensions or renewals of IEC/IRB 
approval must be obtained for changes to the study such as amendments to  the protocol, 
the ICF , or other study documentation. The written approval of the IEC/IRB together 
with the approved ICF must be filed in the study files. 
The investigator will report promptly to the IEC/IRB any new information that may 
adversely affect the safety of the subjects or the conduct of the study. The investigator will submit written summaries of the study status to the IEC/IRB as required. On completion of the study, the IEC/IRB will be notified that the study has ended. 
14.2 Regulatory Authorities 
Relevant study documentation will be submitted to the regulatory authorities of the 
particip ating countries, according to local/national requirements, for review and 
approval before the beginning of the study. On completion of the study, the regulatory authorities will be notified that the study has ended.

examination or activity before th at subject has given written informed consent to 
participate in the study . 
The investigator or designated personnel will inform the subject of the objectives, 
methods, anticipated benefits, and potential risks and inconveniences of the study. The subject s hould be given every opportunity to ask for clarification of any points that 
he/she does not understand and, if necessary, ask for more information. At the end of 
the interview, the subject will be given ample time to consider the study . Subjects will 
be required to sign and date the ICF. After signatures are obtained, the ICF will be kept

This study will be conducted in full accordance all applicable University of Pennsylvania Research 
Policies and Procedures and all applicable Federal and state laws and regulations including [as 
applicable include the following regulations as they apply 45 CFR 46 , 21 CFR Parts 50 , 54, 56, 
312, 314 and 812 and Good Clinical Practice ]. 
 
[ADDRESS_1204320] low levels of the thyroid hormone triiodothyronine (T3). Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_863687] (HFrEF). In addition, there are no 
proven effective pharmacologic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_863688] 
(HFpEF), which accounts for ≥50% of the heart failure burden.3  
 
Triiodothyronine (T3),  an endogenous thyroid hormone, exerts multiple effects on the 
cardiovascular system, mediated through T3 receptors in the myocardium and vasculature and 
directly on ion channels and mitochondria.4 Overarching effects of T3 include  an increase in 
myocardial contractility and a decrease in systemic vascular  resistance. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_863689] (~20 -30%) of low T3 syndrome in heart failure,5,6 the exogenous administration of 
liothyronine (LT3), the synthetic form of T3, remains an underexplored therapeutic option. 
Approximately 20% of circulating T3 is produced directly from the thyroid, whereas the remaining 
80% is produced from the conversion of circulating thyroxine (T4) to T3 . 
 
Low T3 syndrome has been associated with increased mortality in patients with HFrEF6-8 and 
disease severity in HFpEF9, but whether it is a marker of poor health or a mediator of clinically 
relevant abnormalities in heart failure is unknown. The overall goal of this study is to determine 
the safety, feasibility, and preliminary efficacy of oral LT3 therapy in patients wit h Heart Failure 
(HF) and low T3.  
 
Proof of concept clinical studies using short -term intravenous LT3 infusions have demonstrated 
beneficial effects on biomarkers and safety in patients with ischemic HFrEF . However, knowledge 
gaps remain regarding the safety of oral LT3 therapy in HFrEF. Furthermore, no studies have 
examined LT3 safety in HFpEF.   
 
Low T3 is highly prevalent and predicts poor prognosis in patients with heart failure.  
Thyroid dysfunction is implicated as a poor prognostic factor in heart disease. The low T3 
syndrome, defined as a low T3 level with levels of TSH and free T4 within the normal reference 
range, is present in 20 -30% of patients with HFrEF.5,[ADDRESS_1204321] 
recently been extended to outpatients with chronic heart failure.10  
 
Although less is known about the effects of low T3 in  HFpEF, data from one cross -sectional study 
Developi[INVESTIGATOR_863684] T3 for Heart Failure   Page 5 
 
 
05/11/2022  of 89 patients with HFpEF found that 22% had low T3 syndrome.11 In addition, T3 levels below 
the median were associated with higher levels of BNP and greater sever ity of diastolic 
dysfunction. Our unpublished  data show a 29% prevalence of low T3 syndrome in patients with 
HFpEF and associations of low T3 with worse cardiac function.  
 
LT3 has been available for over 60 years but has not be en studied for this indication.  
Establishment of benefit/dosing and acceptable safety of LT3 therapy in patients with HFrEF 
and/or HFpEF is needed . In addition, feasibility and preliminary efficacy data produced could be 
used to design trials to test whether LT3 therapy, when  dosed appropriately, can benefit patients 
with HF, definitively answering the question of whether or not to pursue larger studies of LT3 
administration in HF.  
 
HFrEF treatment rationale  
There are opportunities for improvement in treatment of HFrEF.  Curre nt approaches to treatment 
of chronic HFrEF include device therapi[INVESTIGATOR_863690]. ICDs also 
improve outcomes by [CONTACT_863719] r arrhythmia. Improved survival has 
been shown with cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT), which has a direct effect on the 
myocardium, and with beta blockers, angiotensin -converting -enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin 
receptor -neprilysin inhibitors, hydralaz ine plus nitrate, and aldosterone antagonists, which curb 
the neurohormonal response. Certain therapi[INVESTIGATOR_863691], such as hydralazine plus nitrates in blacks12 or ivabradine 
in patients with resting heart rate ≥[ADDRESS_1204322] survival in patients 
with therapeutic digoxin levels.17,18 An important lesso n is that a precise understanding of the 
pharmacologic effects and dose -response in the cardiovascular system are essential steps in 
assessing therapeutic potential. Thyroid hormone is a key endogenous regulator of cardiac 
function and its effects require precise regulation: cardiac effects occur from thyroid hormone 
excess as well as deficiency. T3 deficiency is highly prevalent in HFrEF, but the therapeutic 
potential of correcting T3 levels in HFrEF has not been explored.  
 
HFpEF treatment rationale  
There is an urgent need to identify effective agents for the treatment of chronic HFpEF.  
Approximately half of HF is secondary to HFpEF, which is anticipated to represent an even larger 
proportion of the total burden of HF as the population ages.[ADDRESS_1204323] occurred in HFpEF, due to the appreciation of  
the importance of well -conducted early phase trials that characterize the mechanisms and dose -
response of specific interventions.20-28 Detailed hemodynamic and cardiac phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_863692], diastolic 
dysfunction, microvascular disease, and impaired oxygen delivery to peripheral skeletal muscle, 
all of which contribute to exercise intolerance, the cardinal feature of HFpEF.3 Furthermore, 
heterogeneity in the underlying processes that contribut e to HFpEF is increasingly recognized. 
Developi[INVESTIGATOR_863684] T3 for Heart Failure   Page 6 
 
 
05/11/2022  The ability to identify individuals with a specific abnormality  (low T3)  that can be targeted by a 
pharmacologic intervention represents a promising approach.29  
  
1.2 Interventional Agent :  Liothyronine (L -triiodothyronine or LT3)  
Liothyronine  (L-triiodothyronine or LT3) is the synthetic form of the natural thyroid hormone 
triiodothyronine ( T3), available as the sodium salt.  LT3 is most often used to treat hypothyroidism  
and has been used for over [ADDRESS_1204324] elucidated the effects of T3 in 
cardiac myocytes. T3 enters the cardiomyocyte through  membrane transporters, or it is produced 
intracellularly from conversion o f T4 to T3 by [CONTACT_24975] 2 deiodinase . T3 binds to nuclear receptors 
bound to thyroid hormone response elements present in the regulatory regions of target genes, 
acting to regulate the e xpression of a number of genes that encode key proteins including α and 
β myosin heavy chain, Na+K+ ATPase, sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase, and 
phospholamban.4 Nongenomic effects of T3 are mediated through alterations in ion flux through 
ion channels such as the sarcolemmal Na+ channel, inward -rectifying K+ channel, and voltage -
activated potassium channels.[ADDRESS_1204325] shown that LT4 administration fails to restore intracardiac T3 
levels.32,33 In addition, in a rat model of HF due  to ischemic cardiomyopathy, infusion of LT3 
restored contractility to that of control animals.34 This has led to the hypothesis that the failing 
heart is a hypothyroid heart due to intracellular T3 deficiency, irrespective of circulatin g T4 
levels.35 
1.2.2  Clinical Data to Date  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Clinical Studies in Adults  
Research in humans suggests safety of oral LT3 in patients without pre -existing cardiac 
disease.  
In 1891, the use of thyroid extract, which was generated from ground sheep thyroid glands, was 
reported as the first successful treatment for hypothyroidism.[ADDRESS_1204326], and their 
manufacturers never had to submit scientific data or get full FDA approval. Concerns among 
endocrinologists about adverse cardiac effects from high doses of LT3,38 recognition that T4 is 
converted to T3 peripherally,39 the longer half -life of LT4 compared  to LT3, and aggressive 
marketing by [CONTACT_863720]4 thyroid hormone 
Developi[INVESTIGATOR_863684] T3 for Heart Failure   Page 7 
 
 
05/11/2022  replacement in the 1970’s.  
 
LT4 therapy remains the mainstay of treatment of hypothyroidism. LT3 is often added to a loading 
dose of LT4 in patients hospi[INVESTIGATOR_863693] (5 -20 mcg loading dose, followed by 
2.5-10 mcg ever y 8 hours).[ADDRESS_1204327] LT3’s potential clinical impact.  
 
Overt hyperthyroidism (low TSH with elevated free T4 or T3) and subclinical hyperthyroidism (low 
TSH with normal free T4 and T3) are each associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation.42-
[ADDRESS_1204328].   
 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]    Proof of Concept Studies  
Proof of concept clinical studies  using short -term intravenous LT3 infusions have 
demonstrated safety and efficacy in patients with heart failure. Though preclinical studies 
support the role of LT3 therapy in heart failure, little is known about th e optimal route, dose, and 
frequency of LT3 therapy in humans. Clinical studies using short -term intravenous infusions of 
LT3, lasting a few hours to [ADDRESS_1204329] dose.50 Pi[INVESTIGATOR_863694] a 3 day infusion of LT3 (n=10)  or placebo 
(n=10) in patients with HFrEF and showed improvements in N -terminal pro -B-Type natriuretic 
peptide, noradrenaline, and aldosterone in the LT3 group, along with an improvement in stroke 
volume, without changes in external and intracardiac worklo ad.51 In both studies, LT3 was well 
tolera ted without increased heart rate or arrhythmias.  However, these studies were short -term, 
used intravenous LT3, and did not address HFpEF.  
1.3 Dose Rationale (if applicable)  
Only one study has evaluated the effect s of oral LT3 therapy, at a mean dose of 20 mcg da ily 
(range 10 -40 mcg) for 3 months, in 13 individuals who had low T3 syndrome and HFrEF with very 
mild reductions in ejection fraction at baseline (LV EF =43%).52 There was a non -statistically 
significant improvement in ejection fraction (43.3 vs. 46.0%; p=0.27) in this cross -over study, 
though it is arguable that ejection fraction was an appropriate primary endpoint for these patients. 
In addition, their twice daily  dosing regimen and dependence on TSH levels instead of T3 levels 
for titration resulted in a small mean change in T3 levels (0.3 nmol/L; 20 ng/dL), which could have 
been insufficient to induce a meaningful physiologic effect. Cardiac monitoring for the fi rst 48 
Developi[INVESTIGATOR_863684] T3 for Heart Failure   Page 8 
 
 
05/11/[ADDRESS_1204330] been tolerated while still 
achieving efficacy.  
 
These studies highlight the need for careful, individualized titration to stay within T3’s therapeutic 
window.  
 
We will be titrating LT3 to T3 levels, not TSH levels. The TSH level is a biomarker for pi[INVESTIGATOR_863695] T3, whereas the T3 assay is a direct measurement of circulating T3. At this time, 
there is no biomarker for cardiac tissue sensitivity to T3. The single published study of oral LT3 in 
HF tit rated the LT3 dose to the TSH level, whereas the 3 -day IV LT3 in HF study titrated LT3 dose 
to the T3 level.51,52 The 24 -hour dose in th e oral LT3 study was 2/3 of the dose in the IV LT3 study; 
only the  IV LT3 study demonstrated a clinically meaningful difference. We will measure total T3 
levels from 2 -4 hours after the LT3 dose, which represents the peak T3 level,54,55 to ensur e that 
T3 level remains within the reference range throughout the day. There is little diurnal variation of 
endogenous T3, with only an 11% difference between peak and nadir levels.56 Endogenous peak 
T3 levels occur at approximately 4 am,56 which will not coincide with the peak T3 level from our 
planned evening LT3 dose. Within -person assessments of T3 levels are s table when assessed 
daily51 or monthly.57 Although, in t heory, the free T3 assay should be more biologically  relevant 
than the total T3 assay, measurement of pg/mL quantities of free T3 can be challenging. As such 
we will measure total T3, as recommended by [CONTACT_863721].58 
 
In this study, a dministratio n of liothyronine (LT3) will begin with an  initial dose of [ADDRESS_1204331] that 5 mcg three times daily should 
not result in T3 excess in patients with low endogenous T3 levels.54 The titration phase will be 
~four weeks, followed  by a ~four week maintenance phase, before crossover.  T here will be a 
~weekly titration of active drug and matched titration of placebo over ~four weeks based upon 
peak total T 3 levels obtained 2 -4 hours after the morning LT3 dose.  After ~four weeks of t itration, 
the minimum LT3 dose will be 2. 5 mcg three times daily  (7.5mcg)  and the maximum LT3 dose 
will be 12.5  mcg three times daily  (37.5mcg) , to be maintained for ~4 additional weeks. The ~2-
week washout between intervention periods will be of sufficient duration to metabolize exogenous 
LT3 due to the short half -life of LT3, which is less than a day.  The low initial dose described, 
gradual titration planned, and careful monitoring of T3 level s in addition to vigilant AE monitoring 
all will protect participants in relation to study dosing.   
 
2 Study Objectives  
Our overall goal is to determine the safety, feasibility, and prelimina ry efficacy of oral LT3 therapy 
in patients with HF and low T3. We  will assess the safety and preliminary efficacy of administering 
oral LT3 therapy in the two independent study populations  in parallel : HFrEF and HFpEF.  It is 
anticipated LT3 will be well tolerated without T3 excess, and that treatment with LT3 will show no 
evidence of increased AEs or arrhythm ic events compared to placebo. We anticipate that 
secondary endpoints will provide sufficient estimates of effect size and variability in HF 
populations to enable accurate power calculations for future phase 2 trials focused on efficacy of 
LT3.

3 Investigational Plan  
3.1 General Design  
The stud y is design ed as two parallel randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled cross -over 
studies  with a ~2-week washout per iod between treatments (Figure 1 ). We will simultaneously 
investigate the safety, feasibility, and preliminary efficacy of thyroid hormone therapy (LT3) in 
individuals diagnosed with heart failure and low T3 syndrome : HFrEF  individuals  in one  arm and 
HFpEF individuals  in a second arm .  Within each group, e ach treatment period will be ~8 weeks 
in duration, with ~weekly titration of study drug  for ~four weeks, followed by a maintenance dose 
for ~4 weeks, then ~2-week washout  before crossing over to the other arm .  We will be titrating 
LT3 to T3 levels, measuring total T3 levels 2 -4 hours after the LT3 dose.

Table ts, US P in the 5 mcg dose and matching placebo tablets will be stored and dispensed from 
Penn’s IDS . 
 
The initial dose of LT3  started at Visit 1  will be 15 mcg (5 mcg three times daily: pre -breakfast, 
mid-afternoon, and bedtime). Six to nine days after initiatio n, the participant will go to a Penn -
affiliated laboratory for a peak total T3 measurement 2 -4 hours after the morning dose. The 
following day, the unblinded stud y physician  will call the participant to recommend continuing this 
dose if the total T3 level is >160 but <180 ng/dL (the upper limit of the reference range) vs. titration 
to 22.5 mcg (7.5 mcg three times daily) if the total T3 level ≤ 160 ng/dL. Pharmacokinetic data 
suggest that 5 mcg three times daily should not result in T3 excess in patients wi th low 
endogenous T3 levels.54 If the total T3 level is >180 ng/dL, the dose will be reduced to 7.5 mcg 

Developi[INVESTIGATOR_863684] T3 for Heart Failure   Page 10 
 
 
05/11/2022  (2.5 mcg three times daily), and the total T3 level will be rechecked the following week.   
 
The process of T3 assessment ~6 days after a dose change or confirmation and dose titration on 
the ~7th day will continue for an additional 3 weeks, to a maximum dose of 12.5 mcg three times 
daily. A titration in the placebo group will occur in parallel to LT3 titration. The titration phase will 
be ~4 weeks in duration, followed by a ~4-week maintenance dose phase.   After ~8 weeks, there 
will be a study assessment in the CHPS research unit (Visit 2). This will be followed by a ~two-
week washout and another assessment (Visit 3). Participants will cross -over and receive the 
alternate therapy, following the same titration scheme as in the initial ~8-week period  and will 
undergo assessment in CHPS unit at Visit 4.  Some flexibility ( up to 3-day delays for titration 
assessments and up to 3 days before or after due dates for the maintenance dose and washout 
phase s) will be allowed in the timing of these visits due to weekend, holidays, CHPS services 
availability, and/ or participants’ personal circumstances.  
 
The primary safety outcomes will be T3 levels within range and arrhythmias. Additional testing at 
study visit s include peak VO2, quality of life, NT -proBNP level, physical activity , 
echocardiography , tonometry measurements , resting energy expenditure, weight, and 
hyperthyroid symptoms. The length of active participation for each participant  who qualifies for 
entry in the study will be ~19 weeks  with a follow up phone call 1 week after Visit 4.  
 
3.1.1  Screening Phase  
Potent ial participants will be recruited from the University of Pennsylvania Health System’s three 
Philadelphia hospi[INVESTIGATOR_863697].   We will use a 2 -stage written informed 
consent process. A study team coordinator will pre -screen focus ing on identifying potential study 
participants in general cardiology clinics, heart failure/transplant clinics, in ternal medicine clinics, 
and the echocardiography laboratory.  Potential participants who may fit criteria for enrollment 
based on record review will be consented for a screening TSH, free T4, and Total T3 blood test  
(See IRB # 833103  protocol/ICF for deta ils).  Additionally, data about medical history, 
medications, and social habits may be collected at this time. They will be provided with a brief 
overview of the study and will  be informed that if they qualify, we will approach them for a more 
detailed discussion  later.  If they consent, the TSH, free T4, and total T3 will be obtained.  If they 
are eligible based upon this information, they will be scheduled for a Visit 1.      
 
3.1.2  Study Intervention Phase  
 
At the  baseline study visit  (Visit 1) , the participant will be randomized to LT3 or placebo. Dose 
titration of LT3 and matching placebo will be overseen by [CONTACT_863722] T3 levels.  The initial d ose of LT3 will be 15 mcg (5 mcg three times daily: pre -breakfast, 
mid-afternoon, and bedtime). At least s ix days (>6 half -lives of LT3) after initiation  (range: 6 -9 
days) , the participant will go to a Penn -affiliated laboratory for a peak total T3 measurement 2 -4 
hours after the morning dose. The following day, the unblinded study physician will call the 
participant to recommend continuing this dose if the total T3 level i s >160 but <180 ng/dL (the 
upper limit of the reference range) vs. titration to 22.5 mcg (7.5 mcg three times daily) if the total 
T3 level ≤ 160 ng/dL. Pharmacokinetic data suggest that 5 mcg three times daily should not result 
in T3 excess in patients wit h low endogenous T3 levels. If the total T3 level is >180 ng/dL, the 
dose will be reduced to 7.5 mcg (2.5 mcg three times daily), and the total T3 level will be 
rechecked the following week.  
 
Developi[INVESTIGATOR_863684] T3 for Heart Failure   Page 11 
 
 
05/11/[ADDRESS_1204332] 6 days (range: 6 -9 days) after a dose change or 
confirmation and dose titration on the 7th day will continue for an additional ~3 weeks, to a 
maximum dose of 12.5 mcg three times daily  (37.5 mcg) . A titration in a placebo participant  will 
occur in parallel to each LT3 titration. Th e titration phase will be ~4 weeks in duration, followed 
by a ~4-week maintenance phase.  
 
After ~8 weeks, there will be a final study assessment on therapy  in the CHPS research unit (Visit 
2). This will be followed by a ~two-week washout. Participants will  have a repeat assessment at 
week 10 (Visit 3), cross -over, and receive the alternate therapy, following the identical titration 
scheme to the initial ~8-week period and a final assessment (Visit 4) at ~week 1 9. 
 
3.1.3  Follow Up Phase  
One week following Visit 4,  a telephone follow -up call will be placed to assess for adverse events 
and answer any remaining participant  questions regarding  the study and intervention.   
3.1.4  Allocation to Interventional Group

Scheduling the next visit for those that qualify may take up to 4 weeks. Active participation after 
screening will be ~19 weeks with a ~1-week follow -up phone call after th e final visit.   
4.5 Total Number of Participant s and Sites  
Recruitment will end when 56 enrolled participant s (28 HFrEF, 28 HFpEF) are randomized . It is 
expected that  [ADDRESS_1204338] is Liothyronine (L -triiodothyronine or LT3) is a synthetic form of the 
natural thyroid hormone triiodothyronine (T3) , available as a sodium salt.   We will be using the 5 
mcg tablet formulation  and a matching placebo  for this intervention .  Liothyronine Sodium  Tablets, 
USP in the 5 mcg dose and matching placebo will be obtained from Sigmapharm  Laboratories 
and delivered to  Kenneth Rockwell, PharmD, MS, Director of Penn’s Investigational Drug Service . 
 
Study Drug and Randomization: Study drug randomization and dispensing will be performed 
through the Penn Investigational Drug Service (IDS) . A randomization list for the order of study 
drug administration (LT3 or placebo) will be created by [CONTACT_698927] a web -based program, 
Developi[INVESTIGATOR_863684] T3 for Heart Failure   Page 15 
 
 
05/11/2022  separately within each study arm - HFrE F and HFpEF . All study drug will be prepared and 
dispensed by [CONTACT_663049].  The drug will be delivered directly  to the participant  at Visits 1 and 
3.  A pi[INVESTIGATOR_863702] 1  so that the scored tablets can be cut according to titration 
instruction  by [CONTACT_863726].    
 
5.2 Study Intervention Regimen  
Study Drug Intervention: Oral LT3 or matched placebo will be self-administered three times daily  
by [CONTACT_4317] . There will be a weekly titration of active drug /placebo  for four weeks  based on 
weekly peak total T3 levels  overseen by [CONTACT_863727] .  The T3 levels will be 
obtained  2-[ADDRESS_1204339] . They 
will be kept securely within the IDS pharmacy in a location protected from light and from excess 
heat or moisture.   
 
5.5 Preparation and Packaging  
The preparation, labeling and dispensing of all study drug (LT3 and placebo) will be done  by [CONTACT_863728] (available at 215 -349-8817 or, for after -hours emergencies, 800 -670-3151) in 
accordance with HUP’s Pharmacy Policy and Procedures. Each dr ug label will include the  
participant ’s unique identification number, date dispensed, and directions for use.  The study drug 
ordered for each participant  will be delivered individually by [CONTACT_863729] 1 and 3 in the CHPS Unit  and collected and returned to IDS during study visits 2 and 4 . 
 
5.6 Blinding  
Study drug randomization will be performed through the Penn Investigational Drug Service (IDS) . 
A randomization list for the order of study drug administration (LT3 or placebo) w ill be created by 
[CONTACT_698927] a web -based program, separately for each of the two study arms . The IDS will 
subsequently perform randomization assignment, and all study investigators, staff, and 
participants will be masked to treatment vs. placebo assignment. Group assignments will be kept 
confidential by [CONTACT_863730]. Unblinding will be strongly discouraged 
and will occur only in the event of an emergency where knowledge of the treatment assignment 
would affect clinical care, or if r ecommended by [CONTACT_863731]/or IRB to address safety concerns. 
Developi[INVESTIGATOR_863684] T3 for Heart Failure   Page 16 
 
 
05/11/2022  Otherwise, unblinding will occur only after the study is complete, data collection is complete, and 
the database is locked.  
   
5.7 Administration and Accountability    
 
Study drug will be dispensed in p erson at Visits 1 and 3  by [CONTACT_17387] .  A pi[INVESTIGATOR_863703] 1. Sufficient  medication for an 8-week period with titrations will be 
dispensed. LT3 will be dosed three times daily to maintain stable levels.55  
 
The initial dose of LT3 will be 1 5 mcg (5 mcg three times daily: pre -breakfast, mid -afternoon, and 
bedtime). At least s ix days (range: 6 -9 days ) after initiation, the participant will go to a Penn -
affiliated laboratory for a peak total T3 measurement 2 -4 hours after the morning dose. The 
following day, the unblinded stud y physician  will call the participant to recommend continuing this 
dose if th e total T3 level is >160 but <180 ng/dL (the upper limit of the reference range) vs. titration 
to 22.5 mcg (7.5 mcg three times daily) if the total T3 level ≤ 160 ng/dL. Pharmacokinetic data 
suggest that 5 mcg three times daily should not result in T3 exce ss in patients with low 
endogenous T3 levels.54 If the total T3 level is >180 ng/dL, the dose will be reduced to 7.5 mcg 
(2.5 mcg three times daily), and the total T3 level will be rechecked the following week.  
 
The process of T3 assessment 6 -9 days after a dose change or confirmation and dose titration 
on the 7th day will continue for an additional 3 weeks, to a maximum dose of  12.5 mcg three times 
daily. A titration in the placebo group will occur in parallel to LT3 titration. The titration phase will 
be 4 weeks in duration, followed by a 4 -week maintenance phase . 
 
After those ~8 weeks, there will be a study assessment in the CHPS research unit (Visit 2). This 
will be followed by a ~two-week washout and another assessment (Visit 3). Participants will cross -
over and receive the alternate therapy, following the identical titration scheme to the initial ~8-
week period and assessment at Visit 4.  
 
5.[ADDRESS_1204340] questioning of study participants  during weekly telephone 
follow -up and study visits . Any evidence of noncompliance will be recorded and participant s who 
are significantly noncompliant with the study treatment regimen may be withdrawn from the study. 
Determination of noncompliance will be based on investigator judgment. To avoid unnecessa ry 
adjustments, un-blinded study physician involved in any medication adjustments will be made 
aware by [CONTACT_863732]’ self -reported adherence to the regimen. Study 
drug will be collected by [CONTACT_863733] [ADDRESS_1204341]  
 
At the  completion of the study, there will b e a final reconciliation of drug distributed , drug 
consumed, and drug remaining. This reconciliation will be logged on the drug reconciliation form, 
signed and dated  in the IDS pharmacy .  Drug destroyed on site will be  documented in the study 
files.

6 Detailed Study Procedures  
 
Clinical Evaluation:  Visits 1 -4.  At each visit, a study physician, nurse or delegated study staff 
will complete a physical exam and review medical history/in terim medical history. Vital signs 
including height  (Visit 1 only), weight, blood pressure, heart rate, pulse ox, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_863704].   Current medication and changes to medications since prior visit will be 
recorded.   
  
Resting Energy Expenditure (REE):  Visits [ADDRESS_1204342] calorimetry 
using the ventilated hood technique (ParvoMedics, Sandy, UT).  
 
EKG:  Visits [ADDRESS_1204343] include heart rate, rhythm, measures of conduction (PR and 
QRS intervals) and repolarization (QT, QTc).  
 
Echocardiography and Arterial Tonometry : Visits 1 -4. Participants will undergo simulta neous 
Doppler echocardiography and arterial tonometry to assess LV function, arterial load and 
ventricul ar-arterial interactions. Both noninvasive assessment s are routinely performed in the 
CHPS unit. From this brief assessment, an array of physiologic measures can be derived after 
data acquisition, as described below .  
 
Transthoracic echocardiography will be performed using a Vivid I e9 system (General Electric). 
The protocol will include standard 2D imaging, pulsed -wave Doppler interrogation of LV infl ow 
and outflow tract velocities, and tissue -Doppler interrogation of mitral and tricuspid annular 
velocities. Simultaneous to LV outflow tract Doppler interrogation, radial and carotid applanation 
tonometry will be performed using a commercially available system (SphygmoCor EM3, AtCor 
Medical) with a high -fidelity applanation tonometer (Millar Instruments).59 Brachial arterial 
pressures will be measured with a validated oscillometric device (Omron 705IT/HEM -759-E; 
Omron Healthcare).60 Radial wavefo rms will be calibrated with brachial systolic and diastolic 
pressures. Radial pressures will be used to calibrate the carotid pressure waveform, which serves 
as a surrogate of the central pressure waveform.61 Once these data are acquired, the following 
offline analyses will be performed to generate quantitative physiologic readouts:  
LV diastolic function : We will quantify LV diastolic function using the early diastolic (e') mitral 
annular velocity, averaged from septal and lateral annular measurements.62 The ratio of mitral 
inflow early  diastolic velocity to  mitral annular velocity (E/e’) will be used as an indicator of LV 
filling pressures.  
LV myocardial strain:  We will quantify peak longitudinal myocardial strain using echoPAC  speckle -
tracking software (GE Healthcare).63-[ADDRESS_1204344] re flections and ventricular -arterial interactions : We will implement detailed analyses 
of arterial pulsatile load using custom -designed software in Matlab (R2011b, MathWorks, Natick, 
MA) a s previously described.61,[ADDRESS_1204345] waves, respectively. Reflection magni tude (RM) will be computed as the ratio of 
backward to forward wave amplitudes (Pb/Pf).  
 
Developi[INVESTIGATOR_863684] T3 for Heart Failure   Page 18 
 
 
05/11/2022  Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ): Visits 1 -4. This is a validated 23 -item 
questionnaire that assess es physical function, symptoms, social function, self -efficacy and 
knowledge, and quality of life.70 It has been used extensively in multiple heart failur e studies.  
 
Hyperthyroid Symptoms from the Thyroid -specific Patient Reported Outcome Measure 
(ThyPRO): Visits 1 -4. This is a validated, thyroid -specific quality of life instrument with 13 
scales.71-73 We will administer 8 items from the Hyperthyroid scale.   
 
Laboratory Assessments: Visits 1 -4. Non-fasting venous bloods will be drawn, processed, and 
stored at -80 degrees for future batched performance of TSH, free T4, total T3, reverse T3, and 
NT-ProBNP a t the Penn Diabetes Research Center Radioimmunoassay and Biomarkers Core. 
At this time, we plan to use the Cobas 4000 analyzer ([COMPANY_002] Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN) for 
TSH, free T4, total T3, and NT -proBNP assays and an ALPCO kit for reverse T3.  However,  
assays change over time, and we will use the best commercially available assays in Year 4 for 
batched analysis.  
 
Cardiac Monitoring Device  Monitor:  The cardiac monitoring device  is a one channel, two -lead 
cardiac monitor that will provide continuous ECG recording up to 14 days ( Figure 2). Since the 
device is small and lightweight (<1 oz.) and does not require battery changes 
for the duration of monitoring, patient compliance and comfort level is high. 
A monitor will be placed at Visits [ADDRESS_1204346]. Lin will also 
review ICD interrogation data collecte d during the 17week study period, in a 
blinded fashion.   
 
Actigraph wGT3X+ Waist Actigraph: We will use waist actigraphy .  The units are the 
size of a large wristwatch (Figure 3) and are attached to an elastic belt worn around the 
waist.   Participants will be asked to wear the unit for the last two weeks of each study 
period (before Visits 2 and 4) except when bathing or charging the unit. The CHPS 
mHealth service will provide a nd support the wGT3X+ (maintenance, data downloads, 
etc.).  Activity counts will be recorded in 10 second epochs, downloaded wirelessly, and 
analyze d using ActiLife software. A Counts per Minute (CPM) value will be derived.  
 
Peak VO2: Visit 2, 4. Participa nts will perform a maximal effort supi[INVESTIGATOR_863705] (VO2) during 
exercise, using a Parvo Medics True One 2400 device. We will use a supi[INVESTIGATOR_863706] (Stress Echo Ergometer 1505, Medical Positioning, Inc, 
Kansas City, MO) and a graded -exercise protocol, with resistance beginning at 12.5 W for 3 
minutes, increasing to 25 W for  3 minutes, and then increasing by 25 W every 3 minutes 
therea fter.

an eligibility blood draw (under protocol # 833103) for TSH, free T4, and Total T3 and to collect 
additional data about medical history, medications, and social habits . Once eligibility is 
established, the participant will be  schedul ed for visit 1. I n person study visits 1 -4 will occur in the

Baseline/Visit 1 : The participant will review and sign the full IRB -approved consent form with the 
study PI [INVESTIGATOR_145814]. A urine pr egnancy test will be performed in women with child -bearing potential. 
A study physician or CHPS nurse practitioner will perform a physical examination including 
medical history. Weight and vital signs will be measured, current medications discussed, and 
resting energy assessment will be performed, followed by [CONTACT_137884], echocardiogram, and tonometry. 
Participants will complete the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ)  and 
Hyperthyroid Symptoms from the Thyroid -specific Patient Reported Outcome Measure  (ThyPRO) 
questionnaires. Approximately [ADDRESS_1204349] at that time during telephone call. Study  
medication will be dispensed and pi[INVESTIGATOR_863707].    
 
Interim dose titration (Weeks 1 -4): Dose titration will be managed by [CONTACT_863727], 
using the titration protocol to achieve a peak T3 level in the upper portion of the refe rence range.  
The initial dose of LT3 will be 15 mcg (5 mcg or 1 tablet three times daily: pre -breakfast, mid -
afternoon, and bedtime). Six  to nine days (>6 half -lives of LT3) after initiation, the participant will 
be instructed to go to a Penn -affiliated l aboratory for a peak total T3 measurement 2 -4 hours after 
their morning dose. The following day, the unblinded study physician will call the participant to 
recommend continuing this dose if the total T3 level is >160 but <180 ng/dL (the upper limit of the 
reference range) vs. titration to 22.5 mcg (7.5 mcg or 1 ½ tablet three times daily) if the total T3 
level ≤ 160 ng/dL.  If the total T3 level is >180 ng/dL, the dose will be reduced to 7.5 mcg (2.5 
mcg or ½ tablet three times daily), and the total T3 leve l will be rechecked the  following week. 
The u nblinded study physician and study staff (during telephone follow -up) will instruct regarding 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_863708], and specifically explain the physical quantity of medication participant  should take for 
the week each time a dose is revised. The process of T3 assessment 6 -9 days after a dose 
change or confirmation and dose titration on the ~7th day will continue for an additional ~3 weeks, 
to a maximum dose of 37.5 mcg (2 ½ tablets three times daily ). A titration in the placebo group 
will occur in parallel to LT3 titration. The titration phase will be ~4 weeks in duration, followed by 
a ~4-week maintenance phase. Participants will be called the day before each lab visit to assess 
symptoms, be reminded  about the blood draw, and verify study medication dosing. At the day 13 
call, they will be reminded to remove the monitoring patch on day 14, to be returned at visit 2.   
 
Weekly calls (Weeks 5 -8): Participants will be called weekly to assess symptoms and  verify 
medication compliance. They will be reminded to start wearing the Actigraph attached to the belt 
over or under their clothing 2 weeks  prior to study visit 2 .  
 
Visit 2 : (~Week 8) : Participants will repeat all measures from Visit [ADDRESS_1204350] study medication. They will return the cardio key rhythm monitoring patch, 
actigraph, and remaining study medication, which will be collected by [CONTACT_863734] a pi[INVESTIGATOR_692].  
Actigraph data will be downloaded by [CONTACT_863735] s taff. Participant will be instructed of two -
week medication was h-out, and visit 3 date will be confirmed.  
 
Visit 3 ( ~Week 10) : After a two -week washout, participants will repeat all measures from Visit 1.  
They will cross -over to the second preparation of study medication (LT3 or placebo) sufficient for

~10-14. A [ADDRESS_1204351] at that time .  
 
Weekly calls (~Weeks 10 -14): Participants will be called weekly to assess symptoms and verify 
medication compliance. They will be reminded to start wearing the Actigraph  attached to the belt 
over or under their clothing 2 weeks prior to study visit 4.  
 
Visit 4 ( ~Week 18) : Participants will perform all measurements from visit 1 plus peak VO2 to 
assess the effects of their second study medication. They will return the cardi o key rhythm 
monitoring patch, A ctigraph, and remaining study medication, which will be collected by [CONTACT_863734] a 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_692].  Actigraph data will be downloaded.  Participant will be instructed of follow -up call they 
will receive at week ~[ADDRESS_1204352] number for the

Follow -up call ( ~Week 19): Participants will be called to assess for signs and symptoms of 
adverse events and to respond to any questions regarding the study and their care  related to it.   
 
6.3 Participant  Withdrawal  
The protocol defined follow -up period per participant  will be up to ~19 weeks + 4 weeks from 
the initial screen. A participant  may withdraw from the study for unanticipated reasons.   
 
If there is a participant  withdrawal for any reason, clear documentation in the participant  CRF’s 
will reflect the circumstance and any follow -up required or recommended by [CONTACT_863736](s).  Participant s who withdraw early will be requested to attend one final visit to 
collect investigational product and to follow up regarding adverse events.

powered our study for efficacy. Instead, we will obtain estimates of central tendency and 
variance for efficacy t o use to power a larger study, as long as the safety parameters support 
advancing to a larger study. Our other  outcomes include clinically relevant efficacy outcomes 
(peak rate of oxygen consumption [VO 2], quality of life and HF symptoms scores, home  activity 
measured via actigraphy, and NT -proBNP) and mechanistic outcomes (noninvasive 
assessments of left ventricular function, vascular function, ventricular -arterial coupling, resting 
energy expenditure, and weight). We will also collect data on hypert hyroid symptoms and 
thyroid function testing. Each outcome is listed in  Table 1  below , along with data collection

05/11/2022  7.1 Primary Endpoint  
This is an early phase study, and thus our primary outcome is safety, defined by T3 levels and 
arrhythmias via rhythm monitoring  (rhythm monitoring and % of participants with T3 levels 
above the reference range  (180 ng/dL ) at the completion of each drug).   
 
7.2 Secondary Endpoints  
Clinically relevant efficacy outcomes:  
 Peak oxygen consumption during a maximal effort exercise test (peak VO 2) 
 Quality of life (Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire, KCCQ  
 Remotely sensed physical activity (actigraph)  
 NT-proBNP  levels  
 
Mechanistic and other secondary endpoints:  
 LV function, arterial load, and ventricular -arterial interactions via simultaneous Doppler 
echocardiography and arterial tonometry  
 Resting energy expenditure  
 Weight: At Visits 1 -4, weight will be measured in the CHPS unit using a calibrated scale.  
 ThyPRO questionnaire section for hyperthyroid symptoms:  
 Thyroid function tests: Serum will be drawn for TSH, free T4, total T3, and reverse T3   
7.3 Statistical Methods  
Preliminary Analyses and Descriptive Statistics : Preliminary data analyses will include 
estimating descriptive statistics for all baseline measures to characterize the sample from which 
subsequent inferences may be drawn. Descriptive statistics will inclu de measures of central 
tendency (mean, median, mode) and variation (standard deviation, interquartile range, range) 
for continuous measures. Distributional properties of all variables will be examined to determine 
if variance stabilizing or normalizing tra nsformations should be applied. For dichotomous and 
categorical variables, measures will include frequencies and percentages. Interim quality 
analyses will be performed regularly to ensure that data collection and archiving procedures are 
operating correct ly. Descriptive estimates of all measures will be generated for all enrollees at 
each of the observed time points or period, as well as by [CONTACT_863739]. Outliers will be accessed via visual inspection of distributions and check ed for accuracy. 
The intervention groups will initially  be compared within each period, with time invariant 
covariates only compared for period 1, according to continuous covariates using parametric or 
non-parametric two -sample t -tests within the general linear modeling framework, depending 
upon whether or not  normality appears to be in question. Levine’s tests will be used to assess 
homogeneity of variance , and normality will be assessed using Shapi[INVESTIGATOR_2152] -Wilk tests. Should 
violations emerge, transformations will be applied or the non -parametric Wilcoxon test will  be 
performed. Additionally, the intervention groups will be compared within period according to 
categorical covariates using Fisher’s Exact tests. Significant differences between groups on 
these variables will result in their use as control variables in t he modeling of outcome.   
 
Primary Analyses  - This study will utilize a crossover design, such that 28 patients with HFrEF 
and 28 patients with HFpEF will be enrolled and randomized to one of 2 sequences, each of 
which consists of 2 periods (AB/BA design, where A=treatment and B=placebo). Specifically, 
within each of the two patient groups (HFrEF and HFpEF), 14 participant s will be randomized to 
8 weeks of placebo, two week washout, followed by 8 weeks of treatment (BA), and 14 
participant s will be random ized to 8 weeks of treatment, two  week washout, followed by 8 
weeks of placebo (AB). See Table 2 below for more details. Peak VO 2 and actigraphy will be 
Developi[INVESTIGATOR_863684] T3 for Heart Failure   Page 25 
 
 
05/11/2022  examined after placebo and after treatment (two timepoints only; TP2 and TP4). All other 
outcomes will be  assessed before and after placebo and before and after treatment (4 
timepoints; TP1 -TP4).  
 
The primary outcome is safety (rhythm monitoring and % of participants with T3 levels above 
the reference range at the completion of each drug). We will be monitoring and summarizing 
safety data using descriptive statistics. Rhythm monitoring will be descr ibed using measures of 
central tendency and variation, as well as frequencies and percents . Frequencies and percents  
will be used to describe participants with T3 levels above the upper limit of reference range at 
the completion of each drug. We will not h ave separate criteria for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_863709]. We 
will also be reporting the number of dropouts/discontinuations as well as the reasons for 
dropouts/discontinuations.  
 
Table 2 . Study Design Overview  
HFrEF patients (n=28)  
BA Arm (n=14)  Phase 1: 8 weeks of placebo  2 week washout  Phase 2: 8 weeks of treatment  
AB Arm (n=14)  Phase 1: 8 weeks of treatment  2 week washout  Phase 2: 8 weeks of placebo  
HFpEF patients (n=28)  
BA Arm (n=14)  Phase 1: 8 weeks of placebo  2 week washout  Phase 2: 8 weeks of treatment  
AB Arm (n=14)  Phase 1: 8 weeks of treatment  2 week washout  Phase 2: 8 weeks of placebo  
TP1=week 0; TP2=week 8; TP3=week 10 , TP4=week 1 8 
 
The legitimacy of the two week washout period will be evaluated by [CONTACT_863740] 0 (TP1) 
versus week 10 (TP3) outcome measures within the AB/BA arms for each of the two patients 
groups. If the outcome measures are within 20% of one another, a clinically significant 
difference, th en we will conclude that the two week washout period is legitimate and we will use 
data from both phases of both arms (AB and BA) in our estimates of outcomes and effect sizes. 
If the difference between the outcome measures exceeds 20%, then we will conclu de that the 
two week washout period is not legitimate and we will use data from both phases of the BA arm 
and only the phase [ADDRESS_1204357] sizes. For 
VO 2 max, we will assess for legitimate washout by 10 week s after therapy by [CONTACT_23992] T4 VO 2 
for the AB patients to the T2 VO 2 for the BA patients. If the values are within 20%, then we will 
perform paired within patient treatment comparisons and test H 0 µ=0.  
 
All secondary outcomes  are measured on a continuum. Effect size estimates will be based 
upon differences by [CONTACT_16303], as well as differences by [CONTACT_863741]. Statistical analyses will be performed on an intention -to-treat basis, with data analyzed 
according to the study arm to which the participant is assigned, regardless of adherence to the 
assigned intervention (oral LT3 treatment vs. placebo). If the two week washout period is 
legitimate, the treatment effect will be examined using paired t -tests an d non -parametric 
Wilcoxon sign -rank tests, as appropriate, on the differences between the paired within -
participant  outcome measures. However, if the washout period is in question, linear mixed -
effects model analyses74 will be conducted, where separate models will be generated for each  
of the outcome measures. Each outcome measure will be regressed on intervention group 
assignment (oral LT3 treatment vs. placebo) , along with baseline outcome and any other 
covariates deemed prognostic in preliminary analyses. The fixed effect of interest will be the 
estimated effect reflecting the difference between intervention groups. Because each response 
variable represents a repeated measure, nested random effects will be modeled for the 
outcome of interest for each study participant and for each time period for each participant. The 
fit of the model will be examined by [INVESTIGATOR_3086] a term for either study phase -by-intervention 
Developi[INVESTIGATOR_863684] T3 for Heart Failure   Page 26 
 
 
05/11/2022  interaction or autocorrelation of the response variable over time, and compared statistically in 
terms of the estimated difference between study phases.75-77 The models will include participant -
specific intercepts as random effects, and will assume independent and identically distri buted 
random errors within -participant . Restricted maximum likelihood estimation will be used, and an 
appropriate covariance matrix will be specified. Model assumptions will be examined (e.g., QQ 
plots to assess normally distributed residuals for valid Wald tests). All linear mixed -effects 
models will be analyzed using the SAS PROC MIXED procedure78 in SAS version 9.4 (SAS 
Institute, Inc. , Cary, NC ). A two -sided 0.05 level of significance will be used for both primary and 
secondary outcomes, without adjustment for multiple comparisons.  
7.3.1  Interim Analysis   
Since th is is a safety study, there will be no interim efficacy analyses.  Non-inferential interim 
analyses will be performed regularly to ensure data collection and archiving procedures are 
operating correctly. Descriptive estimates of all measures will be generated for all patients at 
each observed follow -up time point, as well  as by [CONTACT_863742]. 
Outliers will be visually inspected and checked for accuracy.  
7.4 Participant  Population(s) for Analysis  
The participant population for analysis will be the all -treated population. Any participants 
randomized into the st udy that rece ived at least one dose of investigational product will be 
analyzed. A secondary analysis in the protocol -compliant population will be performed.  
8 Safety and Adverse Events  
8.1 Definitions  
8.1.1  Adverse Event  
 
An adverse ev ent (AE) An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence associated 
with the use of a drug in a subject whether or not considered drug or biologic related. An AE can 
therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom or disease temporally associated 
with the u se of the pharmaceutical product . 
 
8.1.2  Suspected Adverse Reaction  
 
A suspected adverse reaction  (SAR) is any adverse event for which there is a reasonable 
possibility that the drug caused the event.  “Reasonable possibility” suggests there is a causal 
relationship between the drug and the adverse event.  “Suspected adverse reaction” implies a 
lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which means any adverse event 
caused by a dru g.     
8.1.3  Serious Adverse Event  
 
Serious Adverse Event  
Adverse events are classified as serious or non -serious.  An adverse event or suspected adverse 
reaction is considered serious if the investigator or sponsor believes any of the following outcomes 
may occur:  
 
A serious adverse event  is any AE that is:  
Developi[INVESTIGATOR_863684] T3 for Heart Failure   Page 27 
 
 
05/11/2022   fatal 
 life-threatening : place the participant  at immediate risk of death at the time of the event as 
it occurred  
 persistent or significant disability or incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions  
 requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_824754]  
 a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
 important medical events may not result in death, be life threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but based on appropriate medical judgement, they may jeopardize the 
participan t and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent  one of the outcomes 
listed in the above definition  
 
Important medical events are those that may not be immediately life threatening, but are clearly 
of major clinical significance.  They may jeo pardize the participant , and may require intervention 
to prevent one of the other serious outcomes noted above.  For example, drug overdose or abuse, 
a seizure that did not result in in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or intensive treatment of bronchospasm 
in an emergency department would typi[INVESTIGATOR_15355].  
 
All adverse events that do not meet any of the criteria for serious should be regarded as non -
serious adverse events . This determination is based on the opi[INVESTIGATOR_863710], 
and/or DSMB (e.g.if any believe it is serious, it must be considered serious).   
8.1.4  Unanticipated Problems(UP) Involving Risk to Participant s or Others  
Any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the following criteria:  
 Unexpected in nature, severity,  or frequency  (i.e. not described in study -related documents 
such as the IRB -approved protocol or consent form, the investigators brochure, etc)  
 Related or possibly related to participation in the research  (i.e. possibly related means 
there is a reasonable possibility that the incident experience, or outcome may have been 
caused by [CONTACT_3459])  
 Suggests that the research places participant s or others at greater risk of harm  (including 
physical, psychological, economic, or social harm).  
8.1.5  Preexisting Condition  
A preexisting condition is one that is present at the start of the study.  A preexisting condition 
should be recorded as an adverse event if the frequency, intensity, or the ch aracter of the 
condition worsens during the study period.  
8.1.6  General Physical Examination Findings  
At screening, any clinically significant abnormality should be recorded as a preexisting condition.  
At the end of the study, any new clinically significant fin dings/abnormalities that meet the definition 
of an adverse event must also be recorded and documented as an adverse event.   
8.1.[ADDRESS_1204358] each participant  
to report any subsequent event(s) that the participant , or the participant ’s personal physician, 
believes might reasonably be related to participation in this study.

05/11/2022  8.1.8  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], Prolonged Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_202110] a serious adverse event unless specifically instructed otherwise in 
this protocol.  Any condition responsible for additional surgery should be documented as an 
adverse event if the condition meets the criteria for and adverse event.   
 
Neither the condition, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], nor surgery are reported as an 
adverse event in the following circumstances:  
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_68034] a preexisting  condition.  Surgery should not be reported as an outcome of an adverse 
event if the purpose of the surgery was elective or diagnostic and the outcome was 
uneventful.  
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_431237] t he 
study.  
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14843]  
(Heart Failure)  unless it is a worsening or increase in frequency of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_85367].  
 
8.[ADDRESS_1204359] with the participant , the investigator will seek information on adverse events by 
[CONTACT_5147], as appropriate, by [CONTACT_5148].  Information on all adverse events will 
be recorded immediately in the source document, and a lso in the appropriate adverse event 
module of the case report form (CRF)  and entered into the study database . All clearly related 
signs, symptoms, and abnormal diagnostic procedures results should be recorded in the source 
document, though should be group ed under one diagnosis.  
 
All adverse events occurring during the study period  (through week 19)  will be recorded.  The 
clinical course of each event will be followed until resolution, stabilization, or until it has been 
determined that the study interventi on or participation is not the cause.  Serious adverse events 
that are still ongoing at the end of the study period will be followed up to determine the final 
outcome.  Any serious adverse event that occurs after the study period and is considered to be 
possibly related to the study intervention or study participation will be recorded and reported 
immediately.  
8.3 Classification of Adverse Events  
Severity  
Study investigators (PI [INVESTIGATOR_12749] -I) will use the below scale as a guide for determining the severity , 
causal relationship to study drug or research procedures , and “expectedness”  of an adverse 
event.  
 
Classification of Adverse Events Regarding Severity Scale  
Grade 1  Mild AE. Awareness of sign, symptom, or event, but easily tolerated; 
no treatment required  
Grade 2  Moderate AE. Discomfort enough to cause interference with usual 
activity and may warrant intervention. In the latter scenario, AE 
responds to treatment.  
Developi[INVESTIGATOR_863684] T3 for Heart Failure   Page 29 
 
 
05/11/2022  Grade 3 Severe AE. Incapacitating, limiting usual/normal activities or 
significantly affects clinical status requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_25386] .  
Grade 4  Life-threatening or disabling  
Grade 5  Fatal AE  
 
Relatedness   
The relationship of each adverse event to the study procedures  or to the study drug  will be 
characterized  and determined by [CONTACT_9154] [INVESTIGATOR_12749] -I to a nd will be classified ( related, possibly  
related, unlikely or unrelated).   The AE’s will be presented to the DSMB – see DSMP . 
 
 
 
Classification of Adverse Events for Causal Relationship to Study Drug  
Not related  There is not a reasonable causal relationship to the drug and the adverse 
event.  
Unlikely related  
 No temporal association or the cause of the event has been identified,  or 
the drug or biologic cannot be implicated.  
Possibly related  There is reasonable evidence to suggest a causal relationship between 
the drug and adverse event.  
 
Related   
 There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and the influence of 
other factors is unlikely   
  
 
 
Expectedness  
The expectedness of an AE or SAR shall be determined according to the participants’ underlying 
conditions, including all cardiac and non -cardiac diagnoses. Given the wide range of comorbidities 
associated with HF, expectedness will be assessed on a case -by [CONTACT_185116] s.   
 
An unexpected AE  is any AE occurring in one or more participants participating in a research 
protocol, the nature, severity, or frequency of which is not consistent with either:  
1) the known  or foreseeable risk of AEs associated with the procedures involved in the 
research; or  
 
2)  the expected natural progression of any underlying disease  (including heart failure and 
the specific comorbidities present in the individual study participant) , disorder, or condition 
of the participant(s) experiencing the AE and the participant’s predisposing risk factor 
profile for the AE.  
 
Developi[INVESTIGATOR_863684] T3 for Heart Failure   Page 30 
 
 
05/11/2022  The following AEs are anticipated, disease -related events in patients with HF:  
 
Unplanned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], ER visit or clinic visit for worsening HF  
Arrhythmias, particularly atrial fibrillation  
Sudden cardiac death  
Acute coronary syndrome  
Cerebrovascular event  
Venous thromboembolism  
Lightheadedness  
Worsening renal function  
 
The following are potential expected side effect s of LT3:  
Anxiety  
Irritability  
Tremor  
Warmth

8.[ADDRESS_1204360] be reported is defined as the period from the initiation of any study 
procedures (consent) to the end of the study follow -up (Week ~[ADDRESS_1204361]).  Adverse 
events that do not require expedited reporting (see section 8.5 below) will be reported in summary 
to the IRB at continuing review.  The P Is will be responsible for ensuring that all adverse events 
are noted, followed and reported to the IRB, and DSMB, as appropriate.  
.  
8.4.2  Expedited Reporting  of Adverse Events and Unanticipated Problems  
SAEs occurring from signed informed consent to final vis it will be captured on the SAE CRF. AEs 
will be classified according to the guidelines/definitions specified above. Cumulative adverse 
events are participant  to full IRB review at least yearly and DSMB review every [ADDRESS_1204362] becoming aware of the event .   The IRB should be notified as per institutional guidelines  and 
the NHLBI will be notified per required guidelines (see table below) . The DSMB and site IRB, as 
appropriate, may make an immediate determination about the necessity to modify the protocol, 
include additional information in the consent form, inform previous participants, temporarily hold 
enrollment of patients, or terminate  the study. The study will proceed only if the DSMB and site 
IRB all agree on this course of action. The PIs will notify the NHLBI if any of the IRB actions 
described above occur.   
 
Reporting will be consistent with regulatory and sponsor requirements for  the study. At a minimum 
those events that must be reported to the IRB are those that are:  
Developi[INVESTIGATOR_863684] T3 for Heart Failure   Page 31 
 
 
05/11/2022   Probably or definitely related to study participation  and unexpected ( report within 10  
business  days) , or 
 Probably  related, unexpected and event suggests research pl aces subject at greater risk 
than was previously known or recognized ( report within 10 business days).   
 Probably or Definitely related death to study participation and unexpected  (report within 3 
calendar days).  
The report will be submitted on a reportab le event form and the minimum necessary information 
to be provided at the time of the initial report includes:  
 Study identifier  
 Study Center  
 Participant  number  
 A description of the event  
 Date of onset   Current status  
 Whether study treatment was discontinued  
 The reason why the event is classified as 
serious  
 Investigator assessment of the association 
between the event and study treatment  
 
 
  
Within the following 72 hours, the investigator will provide further information  (if available and 
needed)  on the serious adverse event or the unanticipated problem in the form of a reportable 
event form .  This should include any diagnostic information that will assist the understanding of 
the event.  Significant new information on ongoing serious adverse even ts should be provided 
promptly to the study sponsor.  
 
8.4.[ADDRESS_1204363] follow -up information according to the same process used for 
reporting the initial event as described above. If an SAE has not resolved at the time of the initial 
report and new information arises that changes the investigator’s assessment of the event, a 
follow -up report including all relevant new or reassessed information (e.g., concomitant 
medication, medical history) should be submitted to the IRB.  The investigators will follow all 
reportable events until resolution, stabilization or the event is otherwise explained.  
 What Event is Reported  To Whom is Event 
Reported  When is Event Reported  
Fatal or life threatening 
unexpected , suspected  serious 
adverse reactions or adverse 
events  
 
  Local IRB  Within 3 calendar days  (if probably or definitely related  & 
unexpected) – summarize at CR  
 NHLBI, DSMB  Within 7 calendar days/1 week  of initial receipt of 
information  
Non-fatal, non-life-threatening

05/11/2022  The DSMB will review detailed safety data approximately every 6 months throughout the study  
(or at a frequency determined by [CONTACT_4318]).   
 
8.5 Management of Adverse Events -Criteria for Study Drug Discontinuation  
Management of probably  related or possibly related AEs may be managed with dose reduction 
or discontinuation of study drug. Study drug maybe discontinued in the event of an  unexpected  
SAE. In this study population, heart failure is not an unexpected AE or SAE.   
8.6 Unblinding Proce dures  
Any intentional breaking of the blind prior to study completion, which may be necessary, for 
example, in the case of an SAE  that requires knowledge of the treatment assignment for clinical 
care, or directive of the DSMB will be done in conjunction with the IDS, whose responsibility it will 
be to notify a designated member of the research team of the individual participant ’s treatment 
assignment. Any intentional or unintentional breaking of the blind prior to study completion will be 
documented and reported to the IRB within 24 hours .  
8.7 Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_863712]. However, t he study will be stopped if the following 
criteria occur:  
1. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_413726] a condition or conditions that indicate unacceptable risk to the participant s. 
2. There is evidence of harm of study -related treatments or procedures to the participant s. 
3. As direc ted by [CONTACT_863743] s tudy. 
8.8 Oversight and Monitoring  
  
8.8.1  Data and Safety Monitoring Plan  
To ensure the protection of participant s’ rights, the safety of participant s enrolled in the trial, and 
the integrity and quality of the resulting data this study will be monitored as per the Data  and 
Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP) developed for this particular study. This DSMP describes the 
specifications for monitoring, which wi ll be identical between the HFrEF and HFpEF studies. The 
study shall adhere to the requirements described in the protocol, the International Conference on 
Harmonization (ICH), FDA Good Clinical Practice (GCP), and SOPs. In addition to PI [CONTACT_10056] , 
there will be a DSMB . We will also implement an internal monitoring plan.  
 
Study Monitor : The PIs plan to mirror OCRs monitoring standards (and monitoring forms) in 
efforts to ensure the rigor of safety data collected. The Cardiology Clinical Research Unit (CCR U) 
has been enlisted to perform this function.  The PIs will provide a monitoring plan and associated 
documents (protocol, Informed Consent Form; ICF), Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)  to 
the Monitor. The Monitor is qualified by [CONTACT_8640], experience, and training of Good Clinical 
Practice requirements as well as regulatory compliance. Details for the internal study monitored 
are provided in the DSMP.  
 
 
Data and Safety Monitoring Board:  (see section 8.8.2)

Developi[INVESTIGATOR_863684] T3 for Heart Failure   Page 33 
 
 
05/11/[ADDRESS_1204365], and one biostatistician. Penn’s conflict o f interest policy  will be followed . No 
member of the DSMB will have direct involvement in the conduct of the study. Furthermore, no 
member will have financial, proprietary, professional, or other interests that may affect impartial, 
independent decision -making by [CONTACT_4318]. All DSMB members will sign a Conflict of Interest 
certification to that effect at the time they are asked to participate. Interests that may create a 
potential conflict of interest should be disclosed to the DSMB prior to any further disc ussion. The 
DSMB will determine how to handle a potential conflict. The DSMB can require that a member 
with a potential conflict not vote or take other means deemed appropriate.  
 
The primary responsibilities of the DSMB will be to 1) periodically review and evaluate the 
accumulated study data for participant safety, study conduct and progress, and 2) make 
determinations concerning the continuation, modification, or termination of the trials. The DSMB 
will review the study protocol prior to implementation of the study and may request changes to 
adverse event monitoring procedures.  
 
 
Interim Analyses and Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1869] :  Since the proposed study is a safety study, there will be 
no interim efficacy analyses. Safety will be assessed in real time. We have not p roposed stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_37626], and we will allow the DSMB to assess safety without predetermined stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004].  
[ADDRESS_1204366] of 1996 (HIPAA).  Those 
regulations require a signed participant  authorization informing the participant  of the following:  
 What protected health information (PHI) will be  collected from participant s in this study  
 Who will have access to that information and why  
 Who will use or disclose that information  
 The rights of a research participant  to revoke their authorization for use of their PHI.  
 
In the event that a participant  revokes authorization to collect or use PHI, the investigator, by 
[CONTACT_5151], retains the ability to use all information collected prior to the revocation of participant  
authorization.  For participant s that have revoked authorization to collect or use PH I, attempts 
should be made to obtain permission to collect at least vital status (i.e. that the participant  is alive) 
at the end of their scheduled study period.  
9.2 Data Collection and Management  
Data for the proposed trial will be collected by [CONTACT_863744] -
specific and visit -specific data collection forms. All source documents collected in this trial will be 
housed inside of a locked cabinet in on the 12th floor of the Smilow Center for Translational 
Research.  
Data capture and storage will be accomplished using electronic case report forms (eCRFs) within 
the framework of the Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) project. REDCap is a secure, 
web-based application designed exclusively to support data capture for re search studies. It 
provides an intuitive interface for data entry with data validation, audit trails for tracking data 
manipulation and export procedures, automated export procedures for seamless data downloads 
to common statistical packages and procedures  for importing data from external sources. As part 
of our standard practice, a series of computerized data validation checks will also be programmed 
Developi[INVESTIGATOR_863684] T3 for Heart Failure   Page 34 
 
 
05/11/2022  into the REDCap eCRF system to check for missing data, inconsistencies in the data, or data that 
is out of range.  
Once the REDCap database is launched into production mode, study coordinators will be 
responsible for transmitting participant coded electronic data using eCRFs, which will be 
subjected to quality checks for accuracy and completeness.  
9.3 Records Reten tion  
Study records, including administrative and participant related source and CRFs, will be retained 
for 7 years after the completion of the research (often marked by a final progress report).  
   
10 Study Monitoring, Auditing, and Inspecting  
10.1 Study Monitoring Plan  
The investigator and research team will allocate adequate time for such monitoring activities (as 
described in section 8.8 or by [CONTACT_863745] .  The Investigator will also ensure that 
the monitor or other compliance or qual ity assurance reviewer is given access to all the above 
noted study -related documents and study related facilities (e.g. CHPS unit), and has adequate 
space to conduct the monitoring visit.   
10.2 Auditing and Inspecting  
The investigator will permit study -relate d monitoring, audits, and inspections by [CONTACT_1383]/IRB, the 
sponsor, government regulatory bodies, and University compliance and quality assurance groups 
of all study related documents (e.g. source documents, regulatory documents, data collection 
instruments,  study data etc.).  The investigator will ensure the capability for inspections of 
applicable study -related facilities (e.g. pharmacy, diagnostic laboratory, etc.).  
 
Participation as an investigator in this study implies acceptance of potential inspection by 
[CONTACT_16478].  
 
11 Ethical Considerations  
 
This study is to be conducted according to US and international standards of Good Clinical 
Practice (FDA Title 21 part 312 and  International Conference on Harmonization guidelines), 
applicable government regulations and Institutional research policies and procedures.  
 
This protocol and any amendments will be submitted to the Penn Institutional Review Board (IRB), 
for formal appro val of the study conduct.   
 
All participant s for this study will be provided a consent form describing this study and providing 
sufficient information for participant s to make an informed decision about their participation in this 
study.  See Attachment [ADDRESS_1204367] be signed by [CONTACT_863746], and the investigator -designated research professional obtaining 
the consent.

05/11/2022  11.1 Risks  
LT3: LT3 has been in therapeutic use for more than [ADDRESS_1204368] during LT3 treatment.   Adverse reactions will be averted by a low initial dose of LT3 
and gradual dose titration. There will be monitoring for AE’s during week ly calls and each patient 
will have a phone number to call [ADDRESS_1204369] : This test is used extensively for research purposes with minimal 
risk to  participant s. The most significant risks of the test are dysrhythm ias or other cardiovascular 
complications, which  are extremely rare. These procedures will be performed by [CONTACT_863747] ,79,[ADDRESS_1204370]. In 
addition to the  blood pressure (generally increases) and heart rate (generally increases) changes 
during exercise, we will also  monitor arterial saturation. This will be done non -invasively usin g a 
pulse oximeter. Of note, oxygen levels can  decrease with exercise, even in individuals without 
significant cardiopulmonary disease.81,82 If the arterial  saturation falls to below 88% (“severe 
exercise induced hypoxemia”82), we will alert the care provider as this  may prompt consideration 
for additional/alternative causes for arterial hypoxemia.  
 
Arterial tonometry, echocardiogram, resting energy expenditure, actigraphy : These are 
non-invasive  procedures and do not have any known significant risks. It is possible that 
participant s may experience mild, temporary discomfort or skin irritation from the tonometry 
sensor, echo probe, or from wearing the actigraph.  
 
Phlebotomy : The risk of phlebotomy is low. All phlebotomy will be performed by [CONTACT_863748]. Risks include minor discomfort, minor bruising, 
bleeding, hematoma  and/or fainting associated with the drawing of blood. There is also a very 
smal l chance (less than 1%) of  infection at the blood draw site. The amount of blood drawn will 
be 10 cc/visit.  
 
Cardiac Monitoring Device : Shaving the area where adhesive electrodes will be attached as 
well as attachment of adhesive electrodes to the particip ant’s skin may cause skin itching and 
irritation.  
 
Questionnaire (KCCQ, ThyPRO)  completion: Participants may become uncomfortable with 
questions or feel sadness as a result of completing questionnaires.  
 
Developi[INVESTIGATOR_863684] T3 for Heart Failure   Page 36 
 
 
05/11/2022  Confidentiality : There is a potential for a breach of confidentiality. The individual research record 
kept on each participant  will be kept in a locked cabinet exclusively available to PI [INVESTIGATOR_36749].  
Confidentiality will be maintained by [CONTACT_863749], entering 
and retrieving data in computers by [CONTACT_104846], and keepi[INVESTIGATOR_863713] a locked file accessible only by 
[CONTACT_431].  Ongoing  commit ment to stringently protecting confidentiality  will be maintained.   
 
11.2 Benefits  
The proposed research is not expected to benefit rese arch participant s. It is possible that 
participants may experience improvement in symptoms of hypothyroidism or heart failure while 
taking LT3. The major risk is administration of too high a dose of LT3.  Potential participant s may 
choose to participate or  not to participate.   
11.3 Risk Benefit Assessment  
New therapi[INVESTIGATOR_863714] . The risks are reasonable in relation to the 
importance of the knowledge to be acquired. The proposed studies are essential to determine the 
therapeutic potential of LT3 in patients with HFrEF.   
 
11.4 Informed Consent Process / HIPAA Authorization  
All participant s will be provided a consent form describing th e study. Obtaining informed c onsent 
will be a process whereby [CONTACT_863750] a private or semi -private location.  
Sufficient time will be allotted to hear and respond to all po tential participant  questions and 
concerns to provide informed decision s about participation in this study. The formal consent of a 
participant , using the IRB -approved consent form, will be obtained before that participant  
undergoes any study procedure.  T he consent form will be signed by [CONTACT_863751] -designated research professional obtaining the consent.  The process of consent 
will be documented.   
 
[ADDRESS_1204371] with this study (patent ownership, royalties, or 
financial gain greater than the minimum allowable by  [CONTACT_1385], etc.) must have the conflict 
reviewed by a properly constituted Conflict of Interest Committee with a Committee -sanctioned 
conflict management plan that has been reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_21805].  All University of Pennsylvania investigators will follow the University 
conflict of interest policy.  
 
12.3 Participant  Stipends or Payments  
Participants will receive $400 for completing the study as payment for time, effort, and 
inconvenience of being i n the study. In addition, they will be provided parking vouchers to park at 
Penn Presby[CONTACT_24021][INVESTIGATOR_307].  
Developi[INVESTIGATOR_863684] T3 for Heart Failure   Page 37 
 
 
05/11/2022  13 Publication Plan  
 
Study results will be published in peer -reviewed publication. The final, peer -reviewed journal 
manuscript will be submitted to PubMed  Central as per NIH guidelines .  
 
The trial(s) will be registered in www.ClinicalTrials.gov  prior to initiation. Registrations will be 
updated to reflect any protocol amendments during the course of the study. Trial results will be 
uploaded at the time of publication or within one year of trial completion, whichever comes first. 
Informed consent  documents will include a specific statement relating to posting of clinical trial 
information at ClinicalTrials.gov. The University of Pennsylvania has an internal policy in place 
to ensure that clinical trials registration and results reporting occur in compliance with policy 
requirements.

16.1 Source Documents  
Source data is all information, original records of clinical findings, observations, or other activities 
in a clinical trial necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the trial.  Source data are 
containe d in source documents.  Examples of these original documents, and data records include: 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], clinical and office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, participant s’ diaries or 
evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data fr om automated instruments, 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_10379], microfiches, 
photographic negatives, microfilm or magnetic media, x -rays, participant  files, and records kept 
at the pharmacy, at the laboratori es, and at medico -technical departments involved in the clinical 
trial. 
16.2 Case Report Forms (CRFs)  
The study case report form (CRF) is the primary data collection instrument for the study.  All data 
requested on the CRF must be recorded.  All missing data mu st be explained.  If a space on the 
CRF is left blank because the procedure was not done or the question was not asked, write “N/D”.  
If the item is not applicable to the individual case, write “N/A”.  All entries should be printed legibly 
in black ink.  I f any entry error has been made, to correct such an error, draw a single straight line 
through the incorrect entry and enter the correct data above it.  All such changes must be initialed 
and dated.  DO NOT ERASE OR WHITE OUT ERRORS.  For clarification of illegible or uncertain 
entries, print the clarification above the item, then initial and date it.

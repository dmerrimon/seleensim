Mavri Covid 19 Protocol_3 .0_ 2 5June2020  1 Introduction  
1.1 Background 
The 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV; severe acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_6507] 2 
(SARS -CoV- 2)) has spread rapi[INVESTIGATOR_402764], China and resulted in a worldwide pandemic (COVID-19).  Given the burden of disease, effective treatments are urgently required.  The [ADDRESS_629969] lesions in patients who do not present with clinical pneumonia. There seem to be three major patterns of the clinical course of infection: mild illness with upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_402765]; non -life-threatening 
pneumonia; and severe pneumonia with acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_1505] (ARDS) that begins with mild symptoms for 7 –[ADDRESS_629970] S 
requiring advanced life support.  In clinical and epi[INVESTIGATOR_402766] 72,314 case records, providing an important illustration of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_402767], the overall case- fatality rate (on confirme d cases) was 2.3%.  Of note, the fatal cases were 
primarily elderly patients, in particular those aged ≥ 80 years (about 15%) and 70 to 79 years (8.0%). Approximately half (49.0%) of the critical patients were affected by [CONTACT_489988], diabetes, chronic respi[INVESTIGATOR_3765], and oncological diseases died.  
 
In one of the first reports on the disease, Huang et al. illustrated that patients (n = 41) suffered from fever, malaise, dry cough, and dyspnea. Chest computerized tomography (CT) scans showed pneumonia with abnormal findings in all cases. The clinical spectrum of COVID-19 varies from asymptomatic or pauci -symptomatic forms to clinical conditions characterized by 
[CONTACT_15206][INVESTIGATOR_489983] (ICU), to multi-organ and systemic manifestations in terms of sepsis, septic shock, and multiple organ dysfunction syndromes (MODS). In an initial report, about a third of patients required ICU care and 15% of cases were fatal. Similarly, in a more recent report of 201 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_105458], 41.8% developed acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_1505] (ARDS), and 52.4% of these patients die.   In Italy, the case-fatality rate has been reported at 7.2%. Further more, in an initial US 
experience of [ADDRESS_629971] a favorable tr end in the majority of patients; 
in a percentage of cases still to be defined, after about a week, there is a sudden wo rsening of 
clinical conditions with rapi[INVESTIGATOR_402769] /MOF . Criteria for 
definition of specific subpopulations are defined: 
  Confidential  Page 7 
   
 
Mavri Covid 19 Protocol_3 .0_ 2 5June2020  • Severe Pneumonia . Fever is associated with severe dyspnea, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1506], 
tachypnea (> 30 breath s/min), and hypoxia (SpO2 < 90% on room air). However, the fever 
symptom must be interpreted carefully as even in severe forms of the disease, it c an be 
moderate or even absent.  
• Acute Respi[INVESTIGATOR_39053] (ARDS). The diagnosis requires clinical  and 
ventilatory criteria. This syndrome is suggestive of a serious new-onset respi[INVESTIGATOR_402770] -identified respi[INVESTIGATOR_402771]. Different forms of ARDS are 
distinguished based on the degree of hypoxia.  The reference paramet er is the PaO2/FiO2: a 
ratio ≤ 315 is suggestive of ARDS.  
• Mild ARDS: 200 mmHg < PaO2/FiO2 ≤ 300 mmHg. In non- ventilated patients or in 
those managed through non-invasive ventilation (NIV) by [CONTACT_402789]-expi[INVESTIGATOR_27111] (PEEP) or a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) ≥ 5 cmH2O.  
• Moderate ARDS: 100 mmHg < PaO2/FiO2 ≤ 200 mmHg.  
• Severe ARDS: PaO2/FiO2 ≤ [ADDRESS_629972], together with ventilator support, should be considered for patients with hyper -inflammation  to 
prevent and treat ARDS  development. A cytokine profile resembling secondary 
hemophagoc ytic lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH) is associated with COVID -19 disease severity, 
characterized by [CONTACT_178181] (IL) -2, IL -7, granulocyte- colony stimulating factor, 
interferon -γ inducible protein 10, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, macrophage 
inflammatory protein 1 -α, and tumor necrosis factor -α. Predictors of fatality from a recent 
retrospective, multicenter study of 150 confirmed COVID-19 cases in Wuhan, China, included elevated ferritin (mean 1297.6 ng/ml in non-survivors vs 614.0 ng.ml in survivors ; 
p<0.001) and IL-6 (p<0.0001) suggesting that mortality might be due to a dysfunctional hyper -inflammatory res ponse while clearing the virus ( i.e. a hyperinflammatory state driven 
by [CONTACT_40689], not the virus).  
  Confidential  Page [ADDRESS_629973], in a subgroup 
analysis of a randomized controlled trial, patients with sepsis and organ dysfunction or hyper-inflammation had improved survival with IL-1 receptor antagonism, and this therapy has not been associated wi th adverse events, even at high doses. A multicenter, randomized controlled 
trial of tocilizumab (IL -6 receptor blockade, licensed for cytokine release syndrome), has been 
approved in China in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and elevated IL-6 (ChiCTR2000029765).   In our study, we aim to enroll patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia and hyper-inflammation to identify the subgroup of patients for whom immunosuppression could prevent worsening of pulmonary status, including the need for ventilatory support, with the aim ultimately to improve mortality.   
 
Rationale for mavrilimumab 
GM-CSF strongly activates macrophages and is considered to be a pro -inflammatory 
cytokine. GM - CSF production is associated with tissue inflammation. GM CSF -derived 
signals are cri tically involved in the differentiation of macrophages and in the proliferation 
and activation of other immune cells. GM- CSF-activated macrophages produce pro-
inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF), IL- 1β, IL -6, IL -23 and IL-12. 
In addition, GM- CSF receptor activation triggers stimulation of multiple downstream 
signaling pathways, including Janus kinase 2 (JAK2)/signal transducer and activator of 
transcription 5 (STAT5), the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, and the phosphoinositide 3 kinase (PI3K) pathway, all relevant in activation and differentiation of myeloid cells.  
 Under physiologic conditions, levels of circulating GM- CSF are low, but levels are elevated 
in inflammatory conditions. Several cell types can serve as  a source of GM-CSF, including 
fibroblasts, endothelial cells, macrophages, dendritic cells, T cells, neutrophils, eosinophils, and cancer cells, with most production occurring locally at the site of inflammation. This in turn exacerbates the inflammatory reaction via cytokine pathways that have been termed the colony stimulating factor network. GM-CSF can be induced by [CONTACT_489989]-inflammatory cytokines, thus functioning as a feed- forward 
inflammatory amplifier.  
 Zhou et al (2020) recently reported elevated levels of GM-CSF in the lungs of patients with COVID -19, specifically showing that, after the 2019-nCoV infection, CD4+T lymphocytes 
are rapi[INVESTIGATOR_489984] T helper (Th) 1 cells and generate GM -CSF, etc. 
The cytokine environment induces inflammatory CD14+CD16+ monocytes with high expression of IL- 6 and accelerates the inflammation. The authors further contend that these 
aberrant and excessive immune cells may enter the pulmonary circul ation in huge numbers 
and play an immune-mediated damaging role, causing lung dysfunction and rapid mortality.  
 GM-CSF signals through GM- CSF-R, which consists of a specific ligand- binding α -chain 
(GM CSF -Rα) and a signal -transducing β -chain (GM CSF -Rβ) t hat is common to IL- 3 and 
IL-5 receptors. Hence, GMCSF- R signaling can be specifically targeted with antibodies 
  Confidential  Page 9 
   
 
Mavri Covid 19 Protocol_3 .0_ 2 5June2020  directed at GM -CSF-Rα. Mavrilimumab is an anti -GM CSF -Rα monoclonal antibody (human 
isoform IgG4) previously developed by [CONTACT_402791]-CSF signaling axis in humans and improve clinical outcomes measures in a Phase 2 program in Rheumatoid Arthritis.

a cytokine storm syndrome. The identification and treatment of hyper -inflammation using 
existing therapi[INVESTIGATOR_489986] a relevant option to address the immediate need to reduce the rising mortality.  
Mavrilimumab is an anti- GM CSF -Rα monoc lonal antibody (human isoform IgG4) previously 
developed by [CONTACT_489990] -CSF signaling axis in humans and improve clinical outcomes measures 
in a Phase 2 program in Rheuma toid Arthritis.  
4.2 Rationale for dose/regimen and duration of treatment 
Preliminary, publicly  available data suggest  efficacy of mavrilimumab at a dose of 6 mg/kg IV . 
However, these results are from an open -label study, and the results from our Phase II 
randomized, placebo controlled trial may inform the design and dose for larger studies.   
 
  Confidential  Page 12  
   
 
Mavri Covid 19 Protocol_3 .0_ 2 5June2020  In a Phase 1 single- ascending -dose (SAD) study, the pharmacokinetics (PK) of mavrilimumab 
were tested at doses of 0.01 -10 mg/kg in patients with mild -to-moderate RA.  Mavrilimumab 
was well -tolerated in a single IV injection up to 10 mg/kg in subjects with mild to moderate 
RA at all dose levels. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic simulations from studies in 
subjects with RA, coupled with the PK data form the Phase 1 study, indicate that a single dose of  ≥3 mg/kg will provide EC90 (the concentration that leads to 90% maximal response) for the RA endpoint ACR50 (American College of Rheumatology 50% response criteria; data on file) for up to 22 days. Therefore, at doses ≥ 3 mg/kg, the pharmacologic profiles indicated 
sustained peripheral inhibition of the GM- CSF-Rα signaling axis for at least three weeks.  
 In preclinical studies, the potential systemic effects of mavrilimumab (CAM -3001) have been 
investigated in a 4 -week an d an 11-week repeat dose cynomolgus monkey study. There were 
no effects attributable to intravenous (IV) administration of CAM-3001 (mavrilimumab) in doses up to 100 mg/kg/week for 4 weeks in a study conducted in accordance with Good Laboratory Practice (G LP). In an 11-week exploratory (non- GLP) study, there were no effects 
attributable to IV administration of CAM -3001 (mavrilimumab) following 10 mg/kg/week, 
and the no observed adverse event level (NOAEL) was 100 mg/kg/week. An immunocytochemistry screen to  test in vitro binding of CAM-3001 (mavrilimumab) to a panel 
of normal human tissues revealed no non-specific or unanticipated binding of the antibody.  Reference for further details on safety studies in animals and humans is made to the investigator brochure.   However, with regards to mitigation of the aberrant immune response in the setting of COVID -19, it is unclear whether blockade of GM-CSF in the lung is required in addition to 
abolition of signaling in the periphery. Studies with the mavrilimumab su rrogate anti -mouse 
GM-CSF-Rα antagonistic antibody, CAM -3003, were performed to interrogate the pulmonary 
vs peripheral pharmacodynamics of ascending single and repeat doses. Single doses of 3 -30 
mg/kg delivered intra -peritoneally showed no pharmacodynamic effects in the lungs (as 
assessed by [CONTACT_97902] (BAL) fluid assay), despi[INVESTIGATOR_3404] 3 mg/kg dose demonstrating complete receptor occupancy (RO) in the periphery. Pharmacodynamic effects in the lungs, measured by [CONTACT_8668]-6 induction from BAL cells (72% ± 11% inhibition), were seen following only repeated daily doses of 30mg/kg. In contrast, daily administration of 3 mg/kg did not affect IL- 6 induction of BAL cells. This indicates repeated, very high doses (≥10x 
required to completely block the signaling axis in the periphery) are required for the anti- GM-
CSF-Rα antibody to have an inhibitory effect on alveolar macrophages. Interestingly, 
Campbell et al also indicate that significant pharmacodynamic effects of the antibody on the lung cells could be observed after 5 daily doses of 30mg/kg CAM-3003 (53%±23% inhibition). The authors also indicate that PK studies using BAL measurements to quantify portioning in the lung lumen underestimate the partitioning due to dilution with the lavage fluid.     
Of further note, these studies were done in mice without underlying lung pathology, and the 
translatability of these studies in normal mice to humans with COVID -[ADDRESS_629978] that a dose higher than that needed to achieve 1 00% RO in 
circulation may be required in order to achieve therapeutic concentrations in the lung. In current 
COVID-[ADDRESS_629979] already migrated in the lungs.  
 
Taken together, a dose of up to 10 mg/kg (the highest tested in humans) may be required to confer significant pharmacodynamic effects in the lung to inhibit cytokine storm and prevent further lung damage. Supported by [CONTACT_402794] 1 study, it would be reasonable to administer a single dose of mavrilimumab at levels up to 10 mg/kg in an attempt to provide 
desired pharmacodynamics in COVID-[ADDRESS_629980] inhibition of GM-CSF in the lung 
may be a requirement. Hypothetically, a dose of 3 mg/kg may be sufficient and reasonable to be tested, but only if higher proposed dosages in the study are found not to be safe (very close safety monitoring is proposed). Given the lethality of pulmonary complications from COVID-19, the Sponsor/Investigator , with input from COVID-19 treating physicians, is proposing tha t, in Phase 
2, higher doses (higher than 3 mg/kg, given that this dose is apparently sufficient to completely block the signaling axis only in the periphery) be tested first. The IV route of administration is supported by [CONTACT_7609] 1 (Burmester 2011) safety of SAD study in RA patients. As a precaution, the IV infusion of mavril imumab in the COVID -19 Phase 2  study will be administered at slower rates 
than those applied in the SAD study.
 
 
4.3 Risks and benefits 
To date, there are no adverse events with a recognized causal relationship to exposure to 
mavrilimumab. However, there are a number of hypothetical risks that can be extrapolated from the mechanism of action. In particular, GM -CSF antagonism may interfere with immune 
response to infections. It is unknown how likely these effects are to occur, but their frequency  
may be lower with a one-time dose as compared to a longer duration to treat a chronic disease.   
Frequent side effects:  
• Nausea (approximately 1 in 10 subjects, self- limiting)  
• Nasopharyngitis (approximately 1 in 10 subjects, self- limiting)  
• Headache (approximately 1 in 10 subjects, self- limiting)  
Rare but potentially life -threatening adverse reaction:  
• Severe hypersensitivity reactions: While these have not been reported with 
Mavrilimumab, such r eactions (including anaphylaxis, anaphylactoid reactions, 
cytokine release, and endotoxemia) have been observed after administration of other monoclonal antibodies. These reactions may be severe and may result in death.  
• Leukopenia resulting in an increased risk of opportunistic infections. Mavrilimumab reduces the number of neutrophils. In some patients the reduction may be such to expose to additional (opportunistic) infection.  
Additional potential side effects (of unknown frequency): 
• Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP): studies have linked blockage of GM-CSF, the 
target of Mavrilimumab, with PAP. While the use of Mavrilimumab has not been 
  Confidential  Page [ADDRESS_629981].  
• While  the use of Mavrilimumab has not been associated with the development of cancer, 
drugs that modula te the immune r esponse may increase the risk of cancer.  
• Impaired response to vaccines. Drugs that reduce the immune response, like 
Mavrilimumab can impair the immune response to vaccine.  
• Antibodies that inactivate the study drug thus losing its efficacy  
 
In general, the risk to subjects in this trial may be minimized by [CONTACT_359995], close clinical monitoring, as well as periodic review of all safety data by [CONTACT_82571] (DMC).  
Women of child bearing potential must be informed that taking the study treatment may involve 
unknown risks to the fetus if pregnancy were to occur during the study, and agree that in order to participate in the study they must adhere to the contraception requirements outlined in the exclusion criteria. If there is any question that the  subject will not reliably comply, they should 
not be entered or continue in the study.

7.1 Visit schedule and assessments  
The as sessment schedule lists all of the assessments and indicates with an “X”, the visits when 
they are performed. All data obtained from these assessments must be supported in the subject’s 
source documentation. 
Subjects should be seen for all visits/assessments as out lined in the assessment schedule or as 
close to the designated day/time as possible. Missed or rescheduled visits should not lead to 
automatic discontinuation. Subjects who prematurely discontinue the study for any reason should be scheduled for a visit as  soon as possible, at which time all of the assessments listed 
for the final visit will be performed.  
Clinically significant abnormalities must be recorded on the relevant section of the CRFs capturing medical history/ current medical conditions/AE as appropriate.

Mavri Covid 19 Protocol_3 .0_ 2 5June2020  
  • Subject/guardian decision  
• Pregnancy  
• Use of prohibited treatment 
• Any situation in which study participation might result in a safety risk to the subject  
• Any laboratory abnormalities that in the judgment of the investigator prevents the subject 
from continuing study drug administration  
If discontinuation of study treatment occurs, the investigator should make a reasonable effort to understand the primary reason for the subject’s premature discontinuation of study  treatment 
and record this information.  
Subjects who discontinue study treatment or who decide they do not wish to participate in the 
study further should NOT be considered withdrawn from the study UNLESS t hey withdraw 
their consent . Where possible, they should return for the assessments indicated in the 
assessment schedule, understanding that this may  often not be possible with an ongoing 
COVID- 19 pandemic, and therefore telehealth visits may be performed . If they fail to 
return for these assessments for unknown reasons, every effort (e.g. telephone, e -mail, and 
letter ) should be made to contact [CONTACT_423]/pre -designated contact [CONTACT_402799]- up section. This contact [CONTACT_6636].  
If the subject cannot or is unwilling to attend any visit(s), the site staff should maintain regular telephone contact [CONTACT_1155], or with a person pre -designated by [CONTACT_423]. This 
telephone contact [CONTACT_402800].  Patient’s vital 
status can also be verified by [CONTACT_402801]’s primary care physician or other sources according to local rules and regulations. 
After study treatment discontinuation, at a minimum, in abbreviated visits, the following data 
should be collected at clinic visits or via telephone/email contact:

• Does not want to participate in the study anymore  
And 
• Does not allow  further collection of personal data 
It is encouraged that patient provides withdrawal of consent in writing. 
In this situation, the investigator should make a reasonable effort (e.g. telephone, e -mail, letter) 
to understand the primary reason for the subject’s decision to withdraw his/her consent and

Further attempts to contact [CONTACT_402802] u nless safety findings require 
communicating or follow-up. All efforts should be made to complete the assessments prior to study withdrawal. A final 
evaluation at the time of the subject’s study withdrawal should be made as detailed in the assessment table.  
Investigative sites  will continue to keep and use collected study information (including any data 
resulting from the analysis of a subject’s samples until the time of withdrawal) according to applicable law:  
All biological samples not yet analyzed at the time of withdrawal may still be used for further testing/analysis in accordance with the terms of this protocol and of the informed consent form.

In making the decision to terminate, the Sponsor/Investigator will always consider the subject 
welfare and safety. Should early termination be necessary, subjects must be seen as soon as 
possible and treated as a prematurely withdrawn subject. The investigator may be informed of 
additional procedures to be followed in order to ensure that adequate consideration is given to the protection of the subject’s interests. The investigator or sponsor depending on the local regulation will be responsible for informing IRB of the early termination of the trial.

  9 Safety monitoring and reporting  
9.1 Definition of adverse events and reporting requirements 
9.1.1  Adverse events 
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence (e.g., any unfavorable and 
unintended sign [including abnormal laboratory findings], symptom or disease) in a subject or clinical investigation subject after providing written informed consent for participation in the study. Therefore, an AE may or may not be temporally or causally associated with the use of a medi cinal (investigational) product. 
The investigator has the responsibility for managing the safety of individual subject and identifying adverse events.  
Qualified  medical personnel will be readily available to advise on trial related medical questions 
or pro blems.  
The occurrence of adverse events must be sought by [CONTACT_105]- directive questioning of the subject at 
each visit during the study. Adverse events also may be detected when they are volunteered by [CONTACT_402804], laboratory test 
findings, or other assessments. 
Adverse events must be recorded in the Adverse Events CRF under the signs, symptoms or 
diagnosis associated with them, accompanied by [CONTACT_6644] (as far as possible) (if the event is serious refer to Section 10.1.2):  
1. The severity grade: 
• mild: usually transient in nature and generally not interfering with normal activities  
• moderate: sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal activities  
• severe: prevents normal activities  
 
2. Its relationship to the study treatment. If the event is due to lack of efficacy or progression 
of underlying illness (i.e. progression of the study indication) the assessment of causality will usually be ‘Not suspected’. The rationale for this guidance is that the symptoms of a lack of efficacy or progression of underlying illness are not caused by [CONTACT_6645], they happen in spi[INVESTIGATOR_6532]/or both lack of efficacy and progression of underlying disease can only be evaluated meaningfully by [CONTACT_6646], not on a single subject  
3. Its duration (start and end dates) or if the event is ongoing, an outcome of not recovered/not resolved must be reported. 
4. Whether it constitutes a SAE (see Section 10.1.2 for definition of SAE) and which 
seriousness criteria have been met  
5. Action taken regarding with study treatment.  
All adverse events must be treated appropriately. Treatment may include one or more of the following: 
 Confidential  Page 28  
   
 
Mavri Covid 19 Protocol_3 .0_ 2 5June2020  
  • Dose not changed 
• Drug interrupted/withdrawn 
• Its outcome  
a. not recovered/not resolved; 
b. recovered/resolved; 
c. recovering/resolving, 
d. recovered/resolved with sequelae;  
e. fatal; or unknown. 
Conditions that were already present at the time of informed consent should be recorded in 
medical history of the subject.  
Adverse even ts (including lab abnormalities that constitute AEs) should be described using a 
diagnosis whenever possible, rather than individual underlying signs and symptoms. 
Adverse event monitoring should be  continued for at least [ADDRESS_630008] be followed until its resolution or until it is judged to 
be permanent (e.g. Continuing at the end of the study), and assessment must be made at each visit (or more frequently, if necessary) of a ny changes in severity, the suspected relationship to 
the interventions required to treat it, and the outcome. 
Information about adverse drug reactions for the investigational drug can be found in the 
Investigator Brochure (IB). 
Abnormal laboratory values or test results constitute adverse events only if they fulfill at least 
one of the following criteria: 
• they induce clinical signs or symptoms 
• they are considered clinically significant  
• they require therapy  
Clinically significant abnormal laboratory values or test results must be identified through a 
review of values outside of normal ranges/clinically notable ranges, significant changes from baseline or the previous visit, or values , which are considered to be non- typi[INVESTIGATOR_402783].  
9.1.2  Serious adverse events 
An SAE is defined as any adverse event [appearance of (or worsening of any pre- existing)] 
undesirable sign(s), symptom(s) or medical conditions(s) which meets any one of the following criteria:  
• fatal 
• life-threatening  
Life-threatening in the context of a SAE refers to a reaction in which the subject was at risk of 
death at the time of the reaction; it does not refer to a reaction that hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe (please refer to the ICH -E2D Guid elines).  
 Confidential  Page 29  
   
 
Mavri Covid 19 Protocol_3 .0_ 2 5June2020  
  • results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• constitutes a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], unless 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_062]:  
• routine treatment or monitorin g of the studied indication, not associated with any 
deterioration in condition (coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease or peripheral vascular disease).   
• elective or pre- planned treatment for a pre -existing condition that is unrelated to the 
indication under study and has not worsened since signing the informed consent 
• social reasons and respi[INVESTIGATOR_108999]’s general condition  
• treatment on an emergency outpatient basis for an event not fulfilling any  of the 
definitions of a SAE given above and not resulting in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063] 
• is medically significant, e.g. defined as an event that jeopardizes the subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above 
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether other situations should 
be considered serious reactions, such as important medical events that might not be immediately life threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_402784]. Such events should be considered as “medically significant”. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6536].  
All malignant neoplasms will be assessed as serious under “medically significant” if other 
seriousness criteria are not met.  
Any sus pected transmission via a medicinal product of an infectious agent is also considered a 
serious adverse reaction.  
All reports of intentional misuse and abuse of the product are also considered serious adverse event irrespective if a clinical event has occurred .  
9.1.[ADDRESS_630009] be reported to Sponsor/Investigator 
within 24 hours  of learning of its occurrence.  
 
The investigator/sponsor will report all serious, unexpected adverse events as an IND safety 
report to the FDA no later than 15 calendar days after the investigator/sponsor’s initial receipt of this information. Fatal or life -threatening unexpected experiences for which there is a 
possibility that the experience may have been caused by [CONTACT_489992]/sponsor to the FDA by [CONTACT_402806] 7 
calendar days after receipt of this information. An annual report which includes summaries 
of all IND safety reports will be submitted to the FDA each year in the annual report and to

soon as possible but no later than 15 calendar days after the sponsor/investigator receives the safety information and determines that the information qualifies for reporting.  
If the SAE is not previously documented in the Investigator’s Brochure or Package Insert (new 
occurrence) and is thought to be related to the study treatment, a C MO & PS Department 
associate may urgently require further information from the investigator for health authority reporting. Kiniksa  may need to issue an Investigator Notification (IN) to inform all investigators

  Data management will be coordinated by C5Research  at the Cleveland Clinic. Data will be 
entered into a secure dedicated REDc ap cloud database, and data analysis will be performed by 
C5Research.  
Designated investigator staff will enter the data required by [CONTACT_37290] (eCRF). The eCRFs have been built using fully validated secure web -
enabled software that conforms  to [ADDRESS_630013] been trained. Automatic validation programs check for data discrepancies in the eCRFs, allow modification and/or verification of the entered data by [CONTACT_6649].  
The investigator/designee is responsible for assuring that the data (recorded on CRFs  and 
entered  into eCRF) is complete, accurate, and that entry and updates are performed in a timely 
manner. The Investigator must certify that the data entered are complete and accurate. 
After final database lock, the investigator will receive copi[INVESTIGATOR_37210].  
All data should be recorded, handled and stored in a way that allows its accurate reporting, interpretation and verification.

case and visit notes (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5320]) containing demographic and medical information, laboratory data, electrocardiograms, and the results of any other tests or assessments. All information on CRFs must be traceable to these source documents in the subject’s file. The investigator must also keep the original informed consent form signed by [CONTACT_423] (a signed copy is given to the subject). 
The investigator must give the monitor access to all relevant source documents to confirm their 
consistency with the data  capture and/or data entry. Additional checks of the consistency of the 
source data with the CRFs are performed according to the study -specific monitoring plan. No 
information in source documents about the identity of the subjects will be disclosed.  
10 Data analysis and statistical methods 
10.1 Analysis sets  
All patients who provide informed consent  and are randomized  will be included in the analysis.  
Specifically, patients who are randomized and do not receive study medication/placebo and patients who have the study infusion discontinued before completion will remain in the intention -to-treat analysis.  However, we may also perform a secondary, exploratory modified 
intention to treat analysis that would include all patients that actually rec eive study drug or 
placebo.  As noted above, for patients who are lost to follow -up, due diligence will be 
performed, and given the importance of reliable estimates of the treatment effect for planning futures, every effort will be made to document respi[INVESTIGATOR_489987].     
 Confidential  Page [ADDRESS_630015] demographics and other baseline characteristics  
The number and percentage of patients who completed the study, who discontinued the study 
and the reason for discontinuation will be presented for all patients. The frequency (%) of patients with major protocol deviations as well as the criteria leading to data exclusion from 
analysis will be presented in separate tables, if applicable. Finally, the number of enrolled 
patients by [CONTACT_402807].  
Baseline value is defined as the last non -missing assessment prior to the first dose of study drug 
unless specified otherwise.  
Demographic and background characteristic variables will be summarized using descr iptive 
summary statistics. Continuous variables will be summarized using n, mean, standard deviation, median, Q1 (25th percentile), Q3 (75th percentile), minimum, and maximum. Categorical variables will be summarized using frequency and percentage.  
 
10.3 Analys is of the primary and secondary endpoints 
Based on preliminary  case-control data of patients with severe COVID -19 pneumonia treated 
with mavrilimumab, we estimate that 4 0% of patients in the placebo group will  meet the primary 
endpoint compared to 80% of treated patients . A sample size of 30 patients per arm (60 total) 
will provide at least 80% power to detect this difference using a 2-sided alpha of 0.05.  
The results of our study will inform treatment effect to aid in the planning of larger studies. The 
primary efficacy analysis will be on an intention -to-treat basis and include all patients who are 
randomized. Use of supplemental oxygen and vital status will be assessed daily up to day 14. . 
Patients will be considered to have met the  primary endpoint if the patient is alive at day [ADDRESS_630016] 24 hours, regardless of whether or not the patient is still in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (i.e. success=1). All other patients will be counted as not meeting the primar y endpoint (i.e. success=0), including deaths on or before day 14 and patients for whom 
information cannot be ascertained (eg.lost to follow -up, withdrew consent, or otherwise missing 
information on the primary endpoint at day 14). This is analogous to imputing the worst case scenario for missing data.   
 The primary analysis will report the number and percentage of patients meeting the primary 
endpoint. The chi -square statistic will be used to test the difference between the two treatment 
groups. The time to freedom from supplemental oxygen will also be displayed geographically 
with a  Kaplan Meier curve. A two -sided p value of < 0.[ADDRESS_630017] of our clinical outcomes to appropriately power larger studies.  
The secondary endpoint s are is
 the proportion of patients alive  at day 28 (i.e. success=1), and 
the proportion of patients alive  and without respi[INVESTIGATOR_402786] 28 (i.e. success=1). Similar 
to the primary analysis, patients not meeting  the this criteria  in each of the secondary endpoints  
will be considered a failure (i.e. success=0), including deaths on or before day 28 and patient s 
 Confidential  Page 35  
   
 
Mavri Covid 19 Protocol_3 .0_ 2 5June2020  
  for whom information cannot be ascertained (e .g. lost to follow -up, withdrew consent, or 
otherwise missing information on the secondary endpoint at day 28). This is analogous to 
imputing the worst case scenario for missing data.   
The probability of pati ents achieving the secondary endpoint successfully will also be estimated 
using Kaplan- Meier estimates and displayed with survival curves.  In addition, we do not plan 
to adjust for multiple hypothesis testing in our secondary and exploratory endpoint s. Therefore, 
these results will be displayed as point estimates with 95% confidence intervals. These intervals 
should not be regarded as definitive for treatm ent effects . Finally , we plan to analyze the 
comparison between mavrilimumab 6 mg/kg versus placebo af ter all patients have reached day 
14 (or have died or been discharged prior to day 14) to expeditiously inform whether a larger 
study should be undertaken.   
 
10.3.[ADDRESS_630018] with multiple adverse events of the same type is only counted once towards the total 
of that event. 
All deaths and serious adverse events will be tabulated.  
All AEs, deaths and serious adverse events will be provided in patient listings.  
11 Ethical  considerations and administrative procedures  
11.1 Regulatory and ethical compliance 
This clinical study was designed and shall be implemented, executed and reported in accordance 
with the ICH Harmonized Tripartite Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice, with ap plicable 
local re gulations US CFR 21, and with the ethical principles laid down in the Declaration of 
Helsinki.  
11.2 Responsibilities of the investigator and IRB 
Before initiating a trial, the investigator/institution must obtain approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_30757]  (IRB) for the trial protocol, written informed consent form, 
consent form updates, subject recruitment procedures  and any other written information to be 
provided to subjects.  
The protocol will be registered in a publicly accessible database such as clinicaltrial s.gov. In 
addition, after study completion and finalization of the study report the results of this trial will 
be submitted for publication and posted in a publicly accessible database of clinical trial results . 
This protocol defines the study objectives, the study procedures and the data to be collected on 
study participants. Additional assessments required to ensure safety of subjects should be administered as deemed necessary on a case by [CONTACT_413]. Investigators  will apply due diligence

Only amendments that are required for subject safety may be implemented immediately provided the health authorities are subsequently notified by [CONTACT_37306]/IEC is notified.  
Notwithstanding the need for approval of formal protocol amendments, the investigator is expected to take any immediate action required for the safety of an y subject included in this 
study, even if this action represents a deviation from the protocol. In such cases, Kiniksa should 
be notified of this action and the IRB at the study site should be informed according to local 
regulations.

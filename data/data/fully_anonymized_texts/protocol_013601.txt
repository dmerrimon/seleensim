Overall Study Design:  
This is a randomized, vehicle- and active (triamcinolone 0.1% cream) -controlled study in subjects with 
mild to moderate AD.  The study is double -blinded for vehicle , INCB 018424 doses, and active control.  
Approximately 300 subjects will be randomized 1:1:1:1:1:1 to INCB018424 1.5% BID, 
INCB018424 1.5% QD, INCB018424 0.5 % QD, INCB018424 0.15 % QD, vehicle BID, and active 
control (triamcinolone 0.1% cream BID ) and stratified by [CONTACT_190061] ( ≤ 7 and >  7).  Subjects receiving 
QD regimens will apply vehicle at the evening application.  Subjects will receive blinded study drug for 
8 weeks.  Subjects randomized to triamcinolone will apply triamcinolone 0.1% c ream BID  for 4 weeks 
and vehicle cream for 4 weeks to not exceed the allowable triamcinolone application duration. 
At Week 8 , subjects who meet criteria (compliant with the Protocol and no safety concerns) will be 
offered  open- label treatment with  INCB018424 1.5% cream BID  for [ADDRESS_225140] application of study drug.  
Study drug (INCB018424 cream , vehicle, or triamcinolone) may not be applied to the face or 
intertriginous areas.  The face and intertriginous areas may be treated with hydrocortisone 2.5% cream 
during the study.  Assessments of BSA should be based on the areas treated with study drug  (excluding 
the face and intertriginous areas that cannot be treated with study drug).  
Subjects who develop additional areas  of AD after the initiation of treatment may treat these additional

Protocol INCB [ZIP_CODE]- 206 15 SEP 2016  
CONFIDENTIAL  areas (except the face and intertriginous areas) as long as the total treated BSA does not exceed 20% and 
there are no safety concerns regarding the additio nal application of study drug. 
Subjects may continue to use bland emollients that do not contain urea or ceramides during the study.  If 
bland emollients are used, the type of cream and amount of application should remain consist ent for the 
duration of the study. 
An interim analysis will  be conducted when at least half of the randomized subjects reach Week 4.  These 
data will be assessed by [CONTACT_190062].  
Sites and the sponsor are blinded to study drug ; however , some personnel at Incyte (without direct contact  
[CONTACT_190063] ) will be unblinded.

CONFIDENTIAL  1. INTRODUCTION 
INCB018424 cream is a topi[INVESTIGATOR_190042]018424 phosphate under development for 
the treatment of subjects with psoriasis , alopecia areata (AA), and  atopic dermatitis (AD) .  
INCB018424 phosphate is an inhibitor of the Janus kinase (JAK) family of protein tyrosine kinases.  Isogenic and inflammatory cytokines are strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of psoriasis,  AA, and  AD.  Because JAKs serve to translate extracellular signals from a number of 
relev ant cytokines and growth factors upregulated in inflammatory diseases such as psoriasis, 
AA, and AD,  JAK inhibitors represent potential therapeutic agents for these disease states.  
1.1. Atopic Dermatitis  
Atopic dermatitis affects approximately 20% of children a nd 10% of adults ( Silverberg  and 
Hanifin  2013), is increasing in incidence, and costs $3.[ADDRESS_225152] medical costs 
alone ( Ellis et al  2002).  Although not life-threatening, patients  with AD are at higher risk for the 
development of other life-threatening disorders such as asthma and food allergy  (Spergel  2010).  
Further more , according to the recent Global Burden of Disease project, worldwide AD is one of 
the [ADDRESS_225153] disability rank of all nonmalignant 
skin diseases  (Hay et al 2014).  Strikingly, despi[INVESTIGATOR_190043], no targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_190044].  
Topi[INVESTIGATOR_190045], which  have associated side effects from 
long- term use , including glucocorticoid -induced folliculitis and localized skin atrophy.  The use 
of systemic glucocorticoids is also limited because of the adverse event (AE) profile.  If current 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_190046], then systemic immunosuppressive agents (eg, cyclosporine, methotrexate) 
are occasionally employed with highly variable efficacy and/or high risk of AEs.  However, recent studies indicate that oral JAK inhibitors are effective in the treatment of AD  (Levy  et al 
2015).  New approaches that improve AD symptoms  and quality of life without introducing 
safety issues are urgently needed.  
1.2. Inflammation  and Atopic Dermatitis  
Type [ADDRESS_225154] highlighted that T helper type 2  cells, group 2 innate lymphoid cells, and basophils, which 
all produce the t ype 2  cytokines interleukin ( IL)-4, IL -5, and/or IL-13, are highly pathogenic in 
the setting of AD  (Kim 2015).  Indeed, all of these cells are increased in frequency in lesional 
skin from AD patients .  Further blockade of these type 2  cytokines decreases disease in both 
murine models and in patients  (Kim et al 2014, Beck  et al 2014).  Taken together, simultaneous 
disruption of multiple type 2  inflammatory cytokine –associated pathways  via JAK inhibition 
may serve as a novel therapeutic modality in AD. 
1.3. Role of Janus Kinases  in Atop ic Dermatitis 
The type 2  cytokines IL -4 and IL-13 signaling through JAK1.  A number of drugs in clinical 
studies for AD are designed to block these cytokines and are highly promising new biologic agents (eg , dupi[INVESTIGATOR_190047]; Beck  et al 2014).  However, these new drugs employ 
humanized monoclonal antibody-mediated approaches, which cannot be used topi[INVESTIGATOR_897].  Thus, 

Incyte Corporation  Page 17 of 72

CONFIDENTIAL  topi[INVESTIGATOR_190048]1 inhibition presents a unique approach to develop a novel non steroidal 
anti-inflammatory agent.  Studies with oral tofacitinib (JAK1 - and JAK3 -inhibitor) have already 
demonstrated efficacy in AD.  Thus, topi[INVESTIGATOR_190049]018424 phosphate is a highly 
promising approach for the treatment of AD.  To date, a topi[INVESTIGATOR_190050] .  The JAK1/2 inhibitor INCB018424 has been 
used systemically successfully in myeloproliferative disorders, and a topi[INVESTIGATOR_190051]018424 has been developed and demonstrated to be active in subjects with psoriasis.

1.7.1. Clinical Efficacy With Topi[INVESTIGATOR_190041]018424 in Psoriasis 
In a double-blind, vehicle- or comparator -controlled, ascending dose, safety, tolerability, PK, and 
preliminary efficacy study of INCB018424 cream in subjects with plaque psoriasis 
(Study INCB  [ZIP_CODE]-201), efficacy was demonstrated with both the 1% cream applied QD and 
the 1.5% cream applied BID, with a trend toward a dose response.  Improvement in lesion 
thickness, erythema, scaling, and reduction in total lesion area were observed in comparison to 
the vehicle.  Reductions in mean lesion scores were 53% for 1% cream QD versus 32% for 
vehicle (p ≤ 0.05) , 54% for 1.5% cream BID versus 27% for vehicle (p ≤ 0.05) , 46% for 1.5% 
cream BID versus 40% for Dovonex® cream , and 58% for 1.5% cream BID versus 44% for 
Diprolene AF® cream.  
In an open-label, multicenter, sequential-cohort, dose-escalation, safety, tolerability, PK, 
pharmacodynamic, and preliminary efficacy study of INCB018424 1% or 1.5% cream applied to 
2% to 20% BSA QD or BID for 4 weeks in subjects with active, stable plaque psoriasis 
(Study INCB  [ZIP_CODE]- 202), the efficacy analyses collectively revealed that all 5  regimens of 
INCB018424 cream, when applied for 28 days, were effective in decreasing the individual signs 
of lesion severity, lesion area, and the overall disease severity of psoriatic plaques .  Within each 
cohort, the mean individual and total psoriasis assessment scores for the treated lesions decreased 
from baseline to each subsequent assessment, indicating an overall lessening of disease severity.  
The total lesion scores for the control lesions within each cohort either increased from baseline, 
indicating a wor sening of disease severity, or decreased marginally from baseline.  
Study INCB [ZIP_CODE]-203 was a 12-week, randomized, multicenter, parallel-group, 
vehicle-controlled, double-blind, dose- ranging study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy 
of QD application of  INCB018424 cream (0.5%, 1.0%, or 1.5%) relative to vehicle cream in 
subjects with stable plaque psoriasis.  Within each active treatment group, the mean scores for 
the individual and total psoriasis lesion assessments, the Psoriasis Area Severity Index , the 
Physician Global Assessment, and the mean treatable percent age of BSA decreased from 
baseline to each subsequent assessment, which indicated an overall lessening of disease severity.  Thus, the efficacy analyses collectively revealed that all 3  doses of INCB018424 cream, when 
applied topi[INVESTIGATOR_190052] 12 weeks, were effective in decreasing the individual signs of lesion 
severity, lesion area, and  the overall disease severity of psoriatic plaques .

Topi[INVESTIGATOR_8587]  2% BID was studies in a Phase 2 randomized vehicle- controlled clinical study 
in subjects with mild to moderate AD.  Over a 4-week period, improvements were noted in 
disease activity (Eczema Area and Severity Index [ EASI ] and pa tient- reported pruritus) and it 
was generally safe and well -tolerated ( Poulin et  al 2015).

018424 (Ruxolitinib) Safety 
In the randomized period of the 2 pi[INVESTIGATOR_190053], Controlled  Myelo fibrosis 
Study With O ral JAK Inhibitor Treatment ( COMFORT )-I and COMFORT -II, discontinuation 
because of AEs regardless of causality was observed in 11.3% of subjects.  The most frequently 
reported adverse drug reactions were thrombocytopenia and anem ia.  Hematological adverse 
reactions (any CTCAE grade) included anemia (82.4%), thrombocytopenia (69.8%), and neutropenia (16.6%).  Anemia, thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia are dose- related effects.  The 
[ADDRESS_225155] frequent nonhematological adverse reactions were bruising (21.6%), dizziness (15.3%), 
and headache (14.0%).  The [ADDRESS_225156] frequent nonhematological laboratory abnormalities were 
increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT; 27.2%), increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST; 18.6%), and hypercholesterolemia (16.9%). 
Long -term follow -up in subjects with myelofibrosis (including [ADDRESS_225157] 2012, COMFORT -I cutoff 02 SEP 2012, and COMFORT -II cutoff 01 SEP 2012 has 
shown that, as expected, the numbers and proportions of AEs and SAEs has increased; however, no new safety signals have emerged (median duration of exposure for this population is 27.6 months, with 1345.78 patient- years of exposure).  
In Study IN CB [ZIP_CODE]-258, in subjects with myelofibrosis with a platelet count between 50 and 
100 × 10
9/L, beginning treatment with 5 mg BID was well-tolerated, avoided levels of 
thrombocytopenia associated with a high risk of significant bleeding, and provided an 
opportunity to increase the dose of ruxolitinib in a safe manner. 
Overall, the safety profile of ruxolitinib in the polycythemia vera (PV) population is generally 
consistent with that observed in the myelofibrosis population.  Ruxolitinib was generally 
well-tolerated in subjects with PV, and only a small proportion of subjects discontinued 
ruxolitinib because of AEs (3.6%).  Most of the AEs were managed by [CONTACT_190066].  
Hematological toxicities were less frequent and less severe in subjects with PV as compared with 
those observed in subjects with myelofibrosis.  No new safety signals emerged from a study in 
pancreatic cancer in combination with capecitabine.   
The AE profile of ruxolitinib was also assessed in 198 healthy subjects, subjects with various 
degrees of renal (n = 32) or hepatic (n = 24) impairment, and subjects with rheumatoid arthritis 
(RA; n = 59).  Adverse events were, in general, mild and  resolved without interventions.

CONFIDENTIAL  4. INVESTIGATIONAL  PLAN  
4.1. Overall Study Design  
This is a randomized, vehicle- and active (triamcinolone 0.1% cream)-controlled study in 
subjects with mild to moderate AD.  The study is double-blinded for vehicle, INCB018424 doses, and active control.  Approximately 300 subjects will be randomized 1:1:1:1:1:1 to 
INCB018424 1.5% BID, INCB018424 1.5% QD, INCB018424 0.5% QD, INCB018424 0.15% 
QD, vehicle BID,  and active control (triamcinolone 0.1% cream BID) and stratified by [CONTACT_190069] ( ≤ 7 and > 7).  Subjects receiving QD regimens will apply vehicle at the evening 
application.  Subjects will receive blinded study drug for 8 weeks.  Subjects randomized to QD regimens will apply vehicle for the evening application.  Subjects randomized to triamcinolone will apply triamcinolone 0.1% cream BID for 4 weeks and vehicle cream for 4 weeks to not 
exceed the allowable triamcinolone application duration ( Figure  2). 
At Week 8, subjects who meet criteria (compliant with the Protocol and no safety concerns) will 
be offered open-label treatment with INCB018424 1.5% cream BID for [ADDRESS_225164] application of study drug. 
Study drug (INCB018424 cream , vehicle, or triamcinolone) may not be applied to the face or 
intertriginous areas.  The face and intertriginous areas may be treated with hydrocortisone 2.5% 
cream during the study.  Assessments of BSA should be based on treated areas (excluding the face and intertriginous areas that cannot be treated with study drug).  
Subjects who develop additional areas of AD after the initia tion of treatment may treat these 
additional areas (except the face and intertriginous areas) as long as the total treated BSA does not exceed 20% and there are no safety concerns regarding the additional application of study drug. 
Subjects may continue to use bland emollients that do not contain urea or ceramides during the 
study.  If bland emollients are used, the type of cream and amount of application should remain consist ent for the duration of the study. 
An interim analysis will be conducted when at least half of the randomized subjects reach Week  4.  These data will be assessed by [CONTACT_190070].  
Sites and the sponsor are blinded to study drug; however, some personnel at Incyte (without direct contact [CONTACT_190063]) will be unblinded.

 Design  
 
4.2. Measures Taken to Avoid Bias  
The study is  randomized and double-blinded with a vehicle and active comparator (triamcinolone 
0.1% cream).  A designated site staff member will be assigned to dispense and collect study 
drug, as well as instruct and assist with application of study drug during the clinic visits.  This 
person should not have study responsibilities that involve either efficacy or safety assessments.  
Returned study drug should be collected before  other study assessments being performed.  Study 
drug should be dispensed at the end  of the visit by [CONTACT_190071], after other visit 
assessments hav e been completed.  When the study drug is dispensed at the study visit, the 
morning dose of study drug for that visit should be applied.  The subject should be counseled at 
this time regarding questions about dose or method of application. 
4.3. Number of Subjec ts 
The study will randomize approximately  300 subjects  in a ratio of 1:1:1:1:1:[ADDRESS_225165] 
(IRB)/independent ethics committee (IEC)  in writing of the study 's completion or early 
termination, send a copy of the notification to the sponsor or sponsor's designee, and retain 
[ADDRESS_225166] numbers will be 6 digits; the first [ADDRESS_225167]'s number.  This subject number will be maintained throughout the study and will not 
be reassigned.  Subjects who withdraw consent or discontinue from the study after being assigned a subject number will retain their initial number.  
The study will utilize an interactive response technology ( IRT) for management of study enrollment.  
The system will assign the subject study number, track subject visits, randomize according to the defined para meters, track study drug, and maintain the blind.  Site staff will contact [CONTACT_190072].  The investigator or designee will select the appropriate kit from their stock that corresponds to the information provided by [CONTACT_190073].  All subsequent dispensing of study drug should follow this process.  Full details will 
be provided in the IRT manual. 
 
5.1.2. Randomization and Blinding  
For subjects who have met all study inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria, the IRT 
should be contact[CONTACT_190074].  
The IRT system will set minimum entry criteria for an IGA score of 2 or 3, a BSA 3% to 20%, and 
will stratif y the treatment groups based on baseline EASI score of ≤ 7 and > [ADDRESS_225168]'s treatment assignment throughout the study (with the excepti on 
of the unblinded team that will assess the results of interim analysis) .  Emergency unblinding 
will occur if an AE requires the investigator to be made aware of the subject 's treatment 
assignment (see emergency unblinding procedures in Section  8.4 and refer to the Study 
Reference Manual ).

5.2.1. Description and Administration 
INCB018424 1.5% cream, INCB018424 0.5% cream, INCB018424 0.15% cream, vehicle 
cream, or triamcinolone acetonide 0.1% cream will be applied topi[INVESTIGATOR_178106] a thin film to the 
affected areas (except the face and intertriginous areas) in the morning and in the evening at least 
[ADDRESS_225169] 1 hour before and after application of study drug to an area.  Subjects should be cautioned to avoid excessive exposure to either natural or artificial sunlight (including tanning booths, sun lamps, etc) and , 
when outdoors, should be advised to wear loose- fitting clothing that protects the treated area 
from the sun as well as apply sunscreen (see Section  5.6.1 for permitted sunscreens) .  
Immediately after application of study drug, subjects are to wash hands thoroughly with soap and 
warm water.  
Vehicle cream  is matching  in appearance to the INCB018424 creams , except that it does not 
contain active drug.   Subjects receiving QD regimens of INCB018424 cream will receive vehicle 
cream at the evening application.   Triamcinolone acetonide 0.1% cream is in a different vehicle.   
Vehicle cream and triamcinolone 0.1% cream are to be applied in the same manner as 
INCB018424 cream. 
The prescribed dose of study drug is to be determined by [CONTACT_17832] a tube before and after the 
subject applies a thin film of study drug to the affected a reas.  For each 1% of BSA  (palm with 
fingers) to be treated with study drug, approximately 2  inches  (5 cm) of study drug may be used.  
Subjects will be advised to apply cream as a thin film to the affected areas and limit use to no 
more than  [ADDRESS_225170] will be provided as INCB018424 1.5%, 0.5%, and 0.15% cream, or 
vehicle 1.5% (w/w free base equivalent) of INCB018424 phosphate cream.  INCB018424 cream 
(all doses), INCB018424 vehicle cream, and triamcinolone 0.1% cream and will be packaged as

Incyte Corporation  Page [ADDRESS_225172] use of the study drug.  The completed diary will be collected during each visit.  
Qualified clinical staff will review the subjects' entries for compliance.  Subjects who are noncompliant with study drug (defined as < 80% or > 120% compliant based on expected 
application regimen and weight of study drug tubes) will have their administration instructions 
reinforced by [CONTACT_1720] a qualified designee.  Subjects will be considered compliant with the treatment regimen if they apply at least 80% but no more than 120% of the expected 
applications during participation in the treatment p ortion of the study.  Subjects who are 

Incyte Corporation  Page [ADDRESS_225173] additional areas of AD develop after the initiation of treatment may treat 
these additional areas (except the face and intertriginous areas) as long as the total treated BSA 
does not exceed 20%, amount of study drug applied does not exceed [ADDRESS_225174] an unclear relationship to study drug.  Except in cases 
of emergency, it is recommended that the investigator consult with the sponsor medical monitor 
(or other representative of the sponsor) before temporarily interrupting study drug.  Additionally, 
the investigator must obtain approval from the sponsor before res tarting study drug that was 
temporarily interrupted because of an AE or laboratory abnormality. 
Individual subjects may have administration interrupted at the discretion of the investigator, in 
consultation with the sponsor, for AEs or laboratory abnormalities until these have resolved.  
Subjects MUST have administration interrupted in the following situations: 
• The subject develops a Grade 2 increase in ALT (> 3 × ULN) or AST (> 3 × ULN) , 
or a Grade 2 decrease in ANC (< 1.5 × 10
9/L) or platelets (< 75 × 109/L), or a Grade 3 
decrease in absolute lymphocyte count (< 0.5 × 109/L).  Laboratory abnormalities 
should be confirmed with repeat testing within 48 hours whenever possible and STAT delivery of the laboratory results requested. 
• The subject develops a Grade 3 or higher laboratory abnormality, with the exceptions of lipase (in which case a Grade 4, > 5 × ULN , results in discontinuation of study 
medication ) or any asymptomatic triglyceride, cholesterol, or amylase elevations.  
Laboratory abnormalities should be confirmed with repeat testing within a medically 
indicated timeframe, based upon the investigator's judgment and in collaboration with the sponsor's medical monitor, and STAT delivery of the laboratory results requested. 
• The subject had a Grade [ADDRESS_225175] no longer meets 
the criteria for interrupting the dose with the sponsor's approval in consultation with the 

Incyte Corporation  Page 38 of 72 
Protocol INCB [ZIP_CODE]- 206 15 SEP 2016  
CONFIDENTIAL  investigator.  Subjects who meet withdrawal criteria (see Section  5.5.1) during study drug 
interruption will be withdrawn from the study and may not resume administration . 
5.5. Withdrawal of Subjects  From Study Treatment  
5.5.1. Withdrawal Criteria  
Subjects must  be withdrawn from study treatment for the following reasons: 
• The subject becomes pregnant. 
• Consent is withdrawn.   
• Further participation would be injurious to the subject' s health or well -being, in the 
investigator 's medical judgment.  
• The study is t erminated  by [CONTACT_456]. 
• The study is t erminated  by [CONTACT_169101], IRB, or IEC. 
A subject  may be discontinued from study  treatment as follows:  
• If, during the course of the study, a subject is found not to have met eligibility 
criteria,  then  the medical monitor, in collaboration with the i nvestigator, will 
determine whether the subject should be withdrawn from the study. 
• Subjects who are noncompliant with study drug (defined as < 80% or > 120% compliant based on tube weight) will have the administration instru ctions reinforced 
by [CONTACT_1720] a qualified designee.  After reinforcement, subjects who again fail to meet < 80% or > 120% compliance benchmarks in a subsequent visit will be 
considered for withdrawal from the study.  In such cases, the sponsor should be consulted by [CONTACT_190075].  
• If a subject is noncompliant with study procedures in the investigator's opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], the sponsor should be consulted for instruction on handling the subject. 
5.5.2. Withdrawal Procedures  
In the event that the decision is made to permanently discontinue the study drug , the subject will 
be withdrawn from the study and the end- of-treatment  (EOT)  visit should be conducted.  
Reasonable efforts should be made to have the subject  return for a follow-up visit.   These visits 
are described in Section  6.  The last date of the last dose of study drug and the reason for subject 
withdrawal will be recorded  in the electronic case report form ( eCRF ). 
If a subject is withdrawn from the study : 
• The study monitor or sponsor must be notified. 
• The reason(s) for withdrawal must be documented in the subject' s medical record and 
in the eCRF.  
• The EOT  visit should be performed. 

Incyte Corporation  Page 39 of 72 
Protocol INCB [ZIP_CODE]- 206 15 SEP 2016  
CONFIDENTIAL  • The date of the EOT visit should be recorded in the IRT. 
• Subjects must be followed for safety until the time of the follow -up visit or until 
study drug–related toxicities resolve, return to baseline, or are deemed irreversible, 
whichever is longe st. 
If the  subject discontinues study treatment and actively withdraws consent for collection of 
follow-up data (safety follow-up or disease assessment), then no additional data collection 
should occur; however, subjects will have the option of discontinuing study drug but continuing in the follow- up period of the study for safety/efficacy assessments.  
5.6. Concomitant Medications 
All concomitant medications and treatments must be recorded in the eCRF and ideally should remain stable through the end of the treatment portion of the study.  All prior medications for AD  
and any medications received up to 30 days before randomization will be recorded in the eCRF.  
Concomitant treatments and/or procedures that are required to manage a subject' s medical 
condition during the stud y will also be recorded in the eCRF.

6.1. Screening  
Screening is the interval between the signing of the ICF and the day that the subject is enrolled in 
the study.  Informed consent must be obtained before performing any study- specific procedures.  
Assessments that are required to demonstrate eligibility may be performed over the course of 
[ADDRESS_225179] who fails screening may repeat the screening process 1  time if 
the investigator believes that there has been a change in eligibility status (eg, following recovery 
from an infection). 

Incyte Corporation  Page [ADDRESS_225180] signed the ICF and meet all the entry criteria (see Section  3) may be enrolled 
or randomized in the study on Day 1. 
6.3. Treatment  
Subjects who meet all of the study inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will return 
to the study site on Day 1 of administration.  Dates for subsequent study visits will be determined 
based on this day and should occur within the visit windows outlined in the schedule of 
assessments ( Table 2 ). 
The treatment period begins when the subject receives their first dose of study drug, which will 
be administered in the clinic.  The amount of study medication to be obtained from the pharmacy 
is determined by [CONTACT_190076].  On Day 1, the prescribed dose is to be determined by [CONTACT_17832] a tube before and after the subject applies a thin film of study drug to the affected 
areas.  For e ach 1% of BSA (palm with fingers) to be treated with study drug, approximately 
2 inches (5 cm) of study drug may be used.  Subjects will be advised to limit use to no more than 
1 tube per application.  Tubes of INCB018424 cream, triamcinolone 0.1% cream,  or vehicle 
cream will be dispensed to subjects with detailed application instructions .  The face and 
intertriginous areas may be treated with hydrocortisone 2.5% cream throughout the study. 
For all study visits, subjects should apply the morning dose of stud y drug in the clinic to assess 
understanding of dispensing and application.  A designated site staff member will be assigned to 
dispense and collect study drug, as well as instruct and assist with application of study drug during the clinic visits.  Th is person should not have study responsibilities that involve either 
efficacy or safety assessments.  Returned study drug should be collected before other study assessments being performed.  Study drug should be dispensed at the end of the visit by [CONTACT_105332] e 
designated staff, after other visit assessments have been completed.  The subject should be 
counseled at this time regarding questions about dose or method of application. 
Subjects who are noncompliant with study drug (defined as < 80% or > 120% complian t based 
on tube weight) will have the administration instructions reinforced by [CONTACT_1720] a 
qualified designee.  After reinforcement, subjects who again fail to meet < 80% or >  120% 
compliance benchmarks in a subsequent visit will be considered for withdrawal from the study.  
In such cases, the sponsor should be consulted by [CONTACT_190077] l. 
6.4. End of Treatment/Early Termination  
If a decision is made that the subject will perman ently discontinue study drug, then  the EOT visit 
should be conducted.  If the EOT visit coincides with a regular study visit, then the EOT evaluations will supersede those of that scheduled visit, and the data should be entered in the 
EOT page in the eCRF.   If this decision does not coincide with a regular visit, reasonable efforts 
should be made to have the subject return to the site to have the EOT procedures completed.

Protocol INCB [ZIP_CODE]- 206 15 SEP 2016  
CONFIDENTIAL  6.5. Follow -Up 
After the EOT visit (Weeks 8 or 12, or early termination), subjects will have follow-up 
assessments [ADDRESS_225181] (relapse rate), AE s, medication 
history, vital signs, and clinical assessments.   If prohibited treatment for AD  is started, an earlier 
follow-up visit may be performed.  A final and thus end-of-study visit should be performed 
ideally no earlier than [ADDRESS_225182] before conducting any 
study-specific procedures using an ICF approved by [CONTACT_1036]/IEC that contains all eleme nts 
required by [CONTACT_12212] E6 and describes the nature, scope, and pos sible consequences of the study  in a 
form understandable to the study subject.  Local and institutional guidelines for ICF content and administration must be followed; the original signed ICF m ust be retained by [CONTACT_093] , 
and a copy of the signed ICF must be provided to the study subject.  The informed consent 
process for each subject must be documented in writing within the subject source documentation. 
7.2. Interactive Response Technology  Procedure 
The IRT will be contact[CONTACT_147101] a subject ID number when a subject enters screening.  Upon 
determining that the subject is eligible for study entry, the IRT will be contact[CONTACT_169103].   Additionally, the IRT will be  contact[CONTACT_169104].  Full details will be provided in the IRT manual.  
7.3. Demography and Medical History 
7.3.1. Demographics and General Medical History  
Demographic data and general medical history  will be collected at  screening.  

Incyte Corporation  Page [ADDRESS_225183] will be maintained  after  
signing the ICF  to document concomitant medications, including any changes to the dose or 
regimen.  Concomitant medications include any prescription, over- the-counter, or natural/herbal 
preparations taken or administered during the study period.  Concomitant treatments and/or 
procedures that are required to  manage a subject 's medical condition during the study will also be 
recorded in the eCRF.  
7.5. Safety Assessments  
7.5.1. Adverse Events  
Adverse events will be monitored from the time the subject  signs the ICF .  Subjects will be 
instructed to report all AEs during the study and will be assessed for the occurrence of AEs throughout the study.  In order to avoid bias in eliciting AEs, subjects will be asked general, 
nonleading questions such as "How are you feeling? "  All AEs (serious and nonserious) must be 
recorded on the source documents and e CRFs  regardless of the assumption of a causal 
relationship with the study drug .  The definition, reporting, and recording requirements for AEs 
are described in Section  8. 
7.5.2. Physical Examinations 
Physical examinations must be performed by a medically qualified individual such as a licensed 
physician, physician 's assistant, or an advanced registered nurse practitioner, as local law 
permits.  
Clinically notable abnormalities that are considered clinically significan t in the judgement of the 
investigator are to be reported as AEs.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Comprehensive Physical  Examination 
The comprehensive physical examination will include height and body weight (at screening  
only) and assessment  of the following organ or body systems:  skin; head, eyes, ears, nose, and 
throat; thyroid; lungs; cardiovascular  system ; abdomen (liver, spleen); extremities ; and lymph 
nodes; as well as  a brief neurological exam ination . 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Targeted Physical  Examination 
The targeted physical examination will be a symptom- directed evaluation.  The targeted physical 
examin ation will include assessment of the body systems or organs, as indicated by [CONTACT_190078], AEs, or other findings. 

Incyte Corporation  Page [ADDRESS_225184] from 
the study based on an ECG flagged as " Abnormal, Clinically Significant " is the responsibility of 
the investigator, in consultation with the sponsor' s medical monitor, as appropriate.  Clinically 
notable abnormalities that are considered clinically significant in the judgment of the investigator 
are to be reported as AEs. 
7.5.5. Laboratory Assessments 
Clinical laboratory tests will be performed using a central laboratory.  A detailed description of 
the procedures for sampling, handling, storage, and shipment of the central laboratory samples 
and all material such as test tubes and labels is provided in the central Laboratory Manual.  If 
unscheduled local laboratory tests are performed , and if those results lead to a dose modification, 
delay, or dose interruption, or if any additional non-Protocol–required test is performed  because 
of an AE, then those results and the normal reference ranges for those analytes must be 
documented in the eCRF.  Otherwise, unscheduled local laboratory test results need not be entered in the eCRF.  
Additional analytes may be requested based on em erging data, if indicated for safety of study 
subjects.  In addition, some subjects may receive additional assessments as medically indicated; results of nonrequired tests may also be entered in the eCRF. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Chemistry  
A panel of standard serum chemistries will be analyzed at times shown in Table 2.  A list of 
required analytes is found in Table 3.  All serum chemistries will be performed from blood samples collected without respect to food intake (ie, nonfasted). 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Hematology 
Hematology tests will be performed at each study visit indica ted in Table 2.  A list of required 
analytes for scheduled visits is provided in Table 3. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Urinalysis  
Urinalysis will be performed at screening  indicated in Table 2. 

Incyte Corporation  Page 47 of 72 
Protocol INCB [ZIP_CODE]- 206 15 SEP 2016  
CONFIDENTIAL  [IP_ADDRESS]. Pregnancy Testing  
Pregnancy testin g will be performed on all female subjects as noted in the schedules of 
assessments ( Table 2 ).  Serum pregnancy test will be obtained at screening.  A urine pregnancy 
test will be obtained all other visits.  A positive urine pregnancy test should be confirmed by a 
serum pregnancy test. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Serology 
Subjects will be tested for hepatitis and HIV as shown in Table 3.  Serology will be conducted 
during the screening period.  This thorough hepatitis testing is being obtained to better interpret 
any abnormalities in liver function tests that may develop during the course of the study; therefore, it is not mandatory that results of all tests be available before enrollment (Day 1) if 
clinical evaluation and medical history provide no reason to suspect ongoing active or subclinical 
hepatitis infection.  
7.6. Efficacy Assessments  
7.6.1. Eczema Area and Severity Index Score 
Atopic dermatitis will be assessed using the EASI  scoring system (Appendix B ), which is a 
validate d disease measurement for clinical studie s (Hanifin  et al 2001).   The severity strata for 
the EAS I are as follows:  0 = clear; 0.1  to 1.0 = almost clear; 1.1 to 7.0 = mild; 7.1 to 
21.0 = moderate; 21.1 to 50.0 = severe; 50.1 to 72.0 = very severe ( Leshem  et al 2015).  
7.6.2. Investigator's Global Assessment  
The grades  for the  IGA are shown in Table 4. 
Table 4: Investigator' s Global Assessment  
Grade  Severity  Status  
[ADDRESS_225185] perceptible papulation/infiltration  
2 Mild disease  Mild erythema and mild papulation/infiltration

Protocol INCB [ZIP_CODE]- 206 15 SEP 2016  
CONFIDENTIAL  7.6.4. Itch Numerical Rating Scale 
The Itch NRS  is a daily patient -reported measure (24-hour recall) of itch intensity .  Subjects will 
be asked to rate the itching severity because of  their AD  by [CONTACT_20683] a number from 0 (no itch) 
to 10 (w orst imaginable itch)  that best describes their worst level of itching in the past 24 hours. 
Subjects will be issued a hand- held device (eDiary)  on which to record itch severity.  The subject 
will be  instructed to complete the eDiary each night beginning on the day of screening through 
treatment discontinuation.  Subjects will bring the device to the study site at each study visit so 
that the device charging can be verified and accumulated data can be downloaded, as applicable.  The device will then be returned to the subject for continued use each night.  The subject will 
return the device and the docking station for the final time at the EOT visit so that the data can be 
archived.  Detailed direction s for the administration of the eDiary will be provided in the Study 
Reference Manual.  
7.6.6. Photography 
For each visit with photography (baseline and Week 4), photographs of the areas of AD   
 will be obtained. 

Incyte Corporation  Page [ADDRESS_225186]' s 
visit.  Qualified clinical staff will review the subjects ' entries for compliance.  Subjects who are 
noncompliant with either their study drug (defined as < 80% or > 120% compliant based on prescribed application regimen and weight of study drug tubes) will ha ve their administration 
instructions reinforced by [CONTACT_1720] a qualified designee.  Subjects will be considered 
compliant with the treatment regimen if they apply at least 80% but no more than 120% of the 
expected applications during participatio n in the treatment phase of the study. 

Incyte Corporation  Page [ADDRESS_225187] results occurring 
after informed consent constitute AEs only if they induce clinical signs or symptoms, are 
considered clinically meaningful, require t herapy (eg, hematologic abnormality that requires 
transfusion), or require changes in the study drug(s). 
8.1.2. Reporting  
Adverse events  that begin or worsen after informed consent should be recorded on the Adverse 
Events form  of the e CRF.  Conditions that were already present at the time of infor med consent 
should be recorded on the Medical History form in  the eCRF.  Monitoring for the occurrence of 
new AEs should be continued for at least [ADDRESS_225188] dose of study drug.  Adverse 
events ( including lab oratory abnormalities that constitute AEs) should be described usin g a 
diagnosis whenever possible rather than  by [CONTACT_147108].  When a 
clear diagnosis cannot be identified, each sign or symptom should be reported as a separate AE . 
The severity of AEs will be assessed using CTCAE v 4.03 Grades 1 through 4.  T he CTCAE 
v4.03 severity of Grade 5 will not be used; AEs resulting in death  will be graded accordingly 
using Grades [ADDRESS_225189] the outcome noted as fatal.   If an event is not classified by 
[CONTACT_3989], the severity  of the AE will be graded according to the scale below to estimate the grade 
of severity:  
Grade  1 Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention 
not indicated.  
Grade 2  Moderate; minimal, local, or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age -appropriate 
activities of daily living.  
Grade 3  Severe or medical ly significant but not immediately life -threatening; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8942]; disabling; limiting self -care activities of daily living . 
Grade 4  Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.  
The occurrence of AEs should be sought by [CONTACT_165935].  A dverse events may 
also be detected when they are volunteered by [CONTACT_165936], or through physical examination, laboratory test, or other assessments.  To the 
extent  possible, each AE  should be evaluated to determine: 
• The severity grade (CTCAE Grade 1 to  4). 
• Whether there is at least a reasonable possibility  that the AE is related to the study 
treatment:  suspected (yes) or not suspected (no).

CONFIDENTIAL  • The s tart and end dates, unless unresolved at final follow-up. 
• The action taken with re gard to study drug . 
• The event o utcome ( eg, not recovered/not resolved, recovered/resolved, 
recovering/resolving, recovered/resolved with sequelae, fatal, unknown). 
• The s erious ness, as per SAE definition provided in Section  8.3.1. 
Unlike routine safety assessments, SAEs are monitored continuously and have special reporting 
requirements  (see Section  8.3.2). 
All AEs should be treated appropriately.  If an AE is treated with a concomitant medication or 
nondrug therapy, this action should be recorded on A dverse Event form and the treatment should 
be specified on  the Prior/ Concomitant M edications  or Procedures and Non- Drug Therapy form 
in the eCRF . 
Once an AE is detected, it should be followed until it ha s resolved  or until it is judged to be 
permanent;  assessment should be made at  each visit (or more frequently if necessary) of any 
changes in severity, the suspected relationship to the study drug, the interventions required to 
treat the event , and the outcome. 
When the severity  of an AE changes over time for a reporting period (eg, between visits ), each 
change i n severity  will be reported as a separate AE until the event resolves.  For example, 
[ADDRESS_225190] Abnormalities  
Laboratory abnormalities that constitute a n AE  in their own right (considered clinically 
meaningful, induce clinical signs or symptoms, require concomitant therapy, or require changes 
in study drug ) should be recorded on the Adverse Event form in  the eCRF.  Whenever possible, a 
diagnosis rather than a symptom should be provided (eg, " anemia" instead of "low hemoglobin" ).  
Laboratory abnormalities that meet the criteria for AEs should be followed until they have 
returned to normal or an adequate explanation of the abnormality is found.  When an abnormal 
laboratory te st result corresponds to a sign or symptom of a previously reported AE, it is not 
necessary to separately record the laboratory  test result as an additional event.  
Laboratory abnormalities  that do not meet the definition of an AE  should not be reported as AEs .  
A Grade 3 or 4 (severe) AE does not automatically indicate an SAE unless it meets the definition 
of serious, as defined in Section 8.3.1.  A dose modification  for the lab oratory  abnormality may 
be required (see Section  5.4) and should not contribute to the designation of a laboratory test  
abnormality as an SAE . 

Incyte Corporation  Page [ADDRESS_225191] 1 of the following criteria: 
• Is fatal or life -threatening . 
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], unless 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2138] a result of: 
− A routine treatment or monitoring of the studied indication not associated with 
any deterioration in condition . 
− An elective surgery or preplanned treatment for a pre- existing condition that is 
unrelated to the indication under study and has not worsened since signing the ICF. 
− A treatment on an emergency outpatient basis for an event not fulfilling any of the definitions of a SAE and not resulting in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063]. 
− Any social reasons and respi[INVESTIGATOR_4594], in the absence of any deterioration in the subject 's general condition. 
• Results in persistent or significant disability , incapacity , or a substantial disruption of 
a person 's ability to conduct normal life functions. 
• Constitutes a congenital anomaly or birth defect . 
• Is considered to be an important medical event  or a medically significant event that 
may not result in death, be immedia tely life-threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_147065], based on appropriate medical judgment, the event 
may jeopardize the subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 
1 of the outcomes listed above. 
8.3.2. Reporting  
Every SAE, regardless of suspected causality (eg, relationship to study drug(s) or study procedure or disease progression), occurring after the subject has signed the ICF through the last 
study visit (or [ADDRESS_225192] dose of study drug, whichever is later) must be reported to the sponsor (or designee) within [ADDRESS_225193] a reasonable possibility that the SAE is related to the study treatment:  suspected

Protocol INCB [ZIP_CODE]- 206 15 SEP 2016  
CONFIDENTIAL  (yes) or not suspected (no).  Refer to the Incyte Reference Guide for Completing the Serious 
Adverse Event Report Form. 
The contact [CONTACT_89208]' s study- specific representatives  is listed in the 
investigator manual provided to each site.  The original copy of the SAE Report Form and the 
confirmation sheet must be kept at the s tudy site.  
Investigational site personnel must report any new information regarding the SAE within 
24 hours of becoming aware of the information in the same manner that the initial SAE Report Form was sent.  Follow-up information is recorded on an amended or new SAE Report Form, 
with an indication that it is follow -up to the previously reported SAE and the date of the original 
report.  The follow-up report should include information that was not provided on the previous 
SAE Report Form, such as the outcome of the event (eg, resolved or ongoing), treatment 
provided, action taken with study drug because of the SAE (eg, dose reduced, interrupted, or 
discontinued), or subject disposition (eg, continued or withdrew from study participation).  Each recurrence, com plication, or progression of the original event should be reported as follow-up to 
that event, regardless of when it occurs. 
If the SAE is not documented in the IB for the study drug  (new occurrence) and is thought to be 
related to the sponsor' s study drug, the sponsor or its designee may urgently requir e further 
information from the investigator for reporting to health authorities .  The sponsor or its designee 
may need to issue an  Investigator Notification (IN)  to inform all investigators involved in any 
study with the same drug that this SAE has been reported.  Suspected Unexpected Serious 
Adverse Reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) will be collected and reported to the competent authorities and 
relevant ethics committees in accordance with Directive 2001/20/EC , or as per national 
regulatory requirements in participating countries. 
8.4. Emergency Unblinding of Treatment Assignment  
The procedure for emergency unblinding is provided in the study reference manual .  This option 
may be used ONLY if the subject 's well -being requires the investigator to be aware of the 
subject 's treatment assignment.  
The investigator should make every effort to contact [CONTACT_456]' s (or its designee 's) clinical 
research physician  or medical monitor before  unblinding a subject 's treatment assignment; 
however, this is not mandatory .  If a subject 's treatment assignment is unblinded, the sponsor or 
its designee must be notified immediately by [CONTACT_756].  
If an investigator, site personnel performing assessments, or subject is unblinded, the subject  
must be withdrawn  from the study treatment.  In cases where there are ethical reasons to have the 
subject  remain in the study, the investigator must obtain specific approval from the sponsor' s (or 
its designee 's) clinical research physician or medical monitor for the subject  to continue in the 
study.

Data on fetal outcome and breastfeeding are collected for regulatory reporting and drug safety 
evaluation.  Follow-up should be conducted for each pregnancy to determine outcome, including 
spontaneous or voluntary termination, details of the birth, and the presence or absence of any 
birth defects, congenital abnormalities, or maternal and/or newborn complications, by [CONTACT_147109]- baby [CONTACT_765].  Pregnancy sh ould be recorded on a Clinical Trial Pregnancy f orm

8.6. Warnings and Precautions  
Special warnings or precautions for the study drug, derived from safety information collected by 
[CONTACT_3552] , are presented in the Investigator 's Brochure  (IB).  Additional safety 
information collected between IB updates will be communicated in the form of Investigator 
Notifications  (INs) .  Any important new safety information should be discussed with the subject 
during the study, as necessary .  If new significant risks are identified, they will be added to the 
ICF. 
8.7. Data Monitoring Committee  
No external data monitoring committee will be used ; however, an internal data monitoring 
committee will examine the interim analysis . 
8.8. Product Complaints  
The sponsor collects product complaints on study drugs and drug delivery systems used in 
clinical studies in order to ensure the safety of study participants, monitor quality, and facilitate 
process and product improvements. 
All product complaints associated with material packaged, labeled, and released by [CONTACT_190079].  All product complaints associated with other 
study material will be reported directly to the respective manufacturer.

9.1. Study Population s 
The i ntent- to-treat (ITT)  population includes all randomized subjects.   Treatment groups for this 
population will be defined according to the treatment assignment at randomization . 
The per protocol population includes randomized subjects who are considered to be sufficiently 
compliant with the Protocol. 
The safety evaluable population includes all subjects who applied at least [ADDRESS_225196] received on Day 1.

Step 2 will be tested at an overall error rate of 0.03. 
• Step 2:  If Step [ADDRESS_225202] of INCB018424 1.5% BID 
compared w ith triamcinolone and noninferiority test of INCB018424 1.5% QD 
compared with triamcinolone will be carried out using the Bonferroni- Holm 
procedure at an overall 2 -sided α  = 0.03 level.   
• Step 3:  If both of the null hypotheses in Step [ADDRESS_225203] of 
INCB018424 1.5% QD compared with t riamcinolone will be carried out at a 2-sided 
α = 0.03 level. 
If all 4 tests in Branch  1 are significant, then the overall level (α = 0.03) of Branch  [ADDRESS_225204] alternative hypothesis in Branch 2 will 
be tested wi th start level of 2 -sided 0.02. 
[IP_ADDRESS].2. Tests in Branch  2 
• Alternative hypotheses (superiority of INCB018424 1.5% QD and 0.5% QD 
compared with vehicle) will be tested in sequence using the alpha level decided in the 
previous steps.  
If 1 or more of the 4 tests in Branch 1 is nonsignificant, but all tests in B ranch  2 are sign ificant, 
then the alpha level will be re allocated to Branch  1, and Branch  1 will re open with a start  level of 
0.05. 
9.2.2. Noninf eriority Margin  
In the historical study ( Beck  et al 2014) , the difference of percent age change from baseline to 
Day 29 in EASI scores between active control (placebo and glucocorticoids) and placebo was 
27.1% with the derived lower limit of 95% c onfidence interval  (CI)  16.4% .  Therefore, 
27% constitutes the minimum expected benefit of triamcinolone (active control ) over vehicle.  
Given that the result is based on 2 studies with small sample sizes, the margin is chosen to 
be -10%, which is between a half of the lower 95% CI  (-8%) and 50% of the minimum 
effect  (-13.5%).    

Incyte Corporation  Page 58 of 72 
Protocol INCB [ZIP_CODE]- 206 15 SEP 2016  
CONFIDENTIAL  Noninferiority analysis will be performed between each of the active treatment groups and 
triamcinolone. 
9.2.3. Power A nalysis 
Given the assumptions specified in Table 5, a simulation following the graphical procedure was 
performed and showed that a sample size of 50 subjects in each g roup would yield a power of 
> 99% t o test the superiority of the each of the active treatment  group (INCB018424 1.5% BID, 
INCB018424 1.5% QD, and INCB018424 0.5 % QD) to  the vehicle group with a 2-sample t  test.   
Assuming no true differe nce between the active treatment group and triamcinolone with respect 
to percentage change from baseline in EASI scores and an SD of 13 %, the simulation showed 
that the sample size of 50 in each group would yield a power of >  99% to declare that the active 
treatment changes in INCB018424 1.5% BID  and INCB018424 1.5% QD are noninferior to 
triamcinolone (ie , that the lower limit of the 2-sided 95% CI of INCB018424 minus 
triamcinolone is greater than or equal to the noninferiority margin of -10%).  The sample size 
will also provide at least 9 5% power to test the superiority of each of the active tr eatment groups 
of INCB018424 1.5% BID and INCB018424 1.5% QD to the triamcinolone  group. 
9.3. Level of Significance  
A graphical procedure with  a gatekeepi[INVESTIGATOR_190055] I error r ate at a 2 -sided alpha level 
of 0.05.  The underlying procedure is derived using the methodology developed in Bretz et al 
(2009).  This method will guarantee a strong control of the family- wise error rate .  
Simulations results are provided to illustrate Type I error control for the graphical procedure.  
The Type I error rates, provided in Appendix E , Table E.2 , are strongly controlled in all 
scenarios.   
9.4. Statistical Analyses  
9.4.1. Efficacy Analyses 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Efficacy Measures  for Primary and Secondary Endpoints  
[IP_ADDRESS].1. Eczema Area and Severity Index –50 
Eczema Area and Severity Index  score is specified in Section 7.6.  T he categorical variable 
EASI -50 will be equal to 1 if the  percentage i mprovement from baseline in EASI  scores is 50 or 
greater and 0 if less than 50.  This definition is introduced for the purpose of identifying subjects 
who respond to the treatment (1 - re sponder, 0 - nonresponder). 
[IP_ADDRESS].2. Investigator' s Global Assessment  Response  
Investigator' s Global As sessment  response is defined as an IGA score of [ADDRESS_225205] an 
improvement of ≥ 2 points from baseline . 

Incyte Corporation  Page 59 of 72 
Protocol INCB [ZIP_CODE]- 206 15 SEP 2016  
CONFIDENTIAL  [IP_ADDRESS].3. Itch Numerical Rating Scale  
The Itch NRS  score is a single -question as sessment tool with a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 being 'no 
itch' and 10 being  'worst itch imaginable. '  The average itch NRS score will be measured overall, 
for the previous week, and for the previous 24 hours.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Primary Efficacy Analyses  
Comparisons be tween INCB018424 1.5% BID and vehicle based on p ercentage change from 
baseline in EASI scores at Week [ADDRESS_225206] in the ITT. 
The ANOVA model will include  the fixed effects of treatment  and randomization stratification 
factor .  If there are no data after the date of randomization, then the endpoint will be considered 
missing and will not be included in analysis. Supportive analyses for the primary endpoint include a similar ANOVA approach in  the per 
protocol population. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Secondary Efficacy Analyses 
Secondary efficacy analyses will be conducted in the ITT population.   
The key seco ndary endpoints  will be analyzed using the similar ANOVA as specified in the 
primary analysis .  The graphic approach will be used to control family -wise error rate .  Tests for 
noninferiority between [ADDRESS_225207] square mean 
estimate of the percentage change in EASI at 4 weeks .  Noninferiority will be established if the 
lower limit of a 2 -sided CI  for the difference (INCB 018424 minus active control) is higher than 
or equal to -10%.  There will be no adjustment for multiple comparisons for secondary endpoints 
besides key secondary endpoints. 
Mean, change from baseline, and percent age change from baseline of EASI scores at other visits 
besides Week  4 will be summarized using descriptive statistics .  Itch NRS  score daily ,  
 will be summarized and analyzed  in a similar fashion .  
An E
max model will be fit for assessment of the dose response and provide estimates of the 
maximum and minimum response levels, ED 50 (the concentration where the response is the 
midpoint between the maximum and minimum), and the slope parameter. 

Incyte Corporation  Page [ADDRESS_225208] limit method will be used to estimate time –to–EASI -[ADDRESS_225209] stratified by [CONTACT_190081] , if applicable.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Other Efficacy Analyses 
Other efficacy variables will be summarized  and analyzed using similar methods as described for 
the primary and secondary endpoints.  
9.4.2. Safety Analyses 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Adverse Events  
A treatment -emergent AE (TEAE) is any AE either reported for the first time or worsening of a 
pre-existing event after first dose of s tudy drug.  Analysis of AEs will be limited to TEAEs, but 
data listings will include all AEs regardless of their timing to study drug administration.  Adverse 
events will be tabulated by [CONTACT_169108].  Severity of AEs 
will be based on the National Cancer Institute CTCAE v4.[ADDRESS_225210] a relationship to study drug will be 
considered to be treatment- related AEs.  If the investigator does not specify t he relationship of 
the AE to study drug, then the AE will be considered treatment -related.  The incidence of AEs 
and treatment -related AEs will be tabulated.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Clinical Laboratory Tests 
Laboratory test values outside the normal range will be assessed for severity based on the normal 
ranges for the clinical reference laboratory.  The incidence of abnormal laboratory values and 
shift tables relative  to baseline will be tabulated.  
Laboratory data will be classified into Grades 1 through 4 using CTCAE v4.03.  The following 
summaries will be produced for the laboratory data:  
• Number and percentage of subjects with worst postbaseline CTC AE grade (regardless 
of baseline value).  Each subject will be counted only for the worst grade observed 
postbaseline. 
• Shift tables from  baseline to the worst postbaseline value using CTC AE grade.  
• For laboratory parameters where CTC AE grades are not defined, shift tables to the 
worst postbaseline value using the low/normal/high classifications based on 
laboratory reference ranges.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Vital Signs  
Descriptive statistics and mean change from baseline will be determined for vital signs (blood 
pressure, pulse , respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and body temperature) at each assessment time.

Protocol INCB [ZIP_CODE]- 206 15 SEP 2016  
CONFIDENTIAL  10.2. Accountability, Handling, and Disposal of Study Drug  
The investigator is responsible for drug accountability of INCB018424 phosphate cream, 
INCB018424 vehicle cream, and triamcinolone at the study site; however, some of the drug 
accountability duties may be assigned to an appropriate pharmacist or other designee.  Inventory 
and accountability records must be maintained and readily available for inspection by [CONTACT_190085].  The investigator or designee must maintain records that document: 
• Delivery of study drug to the study site.  
• Inventory of study drug at the site. 
• Subject use of the study drug including tube counts from each supply dispensed. 
• Return of study drug to the investigator or designee by [CONTACT_1766]. 
The investigational product as well as triamcinolone must be used only in accordance with the 
Protocol.  The investigator will also maintain records adequately documenting that the subjects 
were provided the specified study drug.  These records should include dates, quantities, and any 
available batch or serial numbers or unique code numbers assigned to the investigational product 
and study subjects. 
Completed accountability records will be archived by [CONTACT_779].  The investigator or designee will 
be expected to collect and retain all used, unused, and partially used containers of study drug 
until verified by  [CONTACT_11200] (unless otherwise agreed to by [CONTACT_456]).  At the 
conclusion of the study, the investigator or designee will oversee shipment of any remaining 
study drug back to the sponsor or its designee for destruction according to institutional standard 
operating procedures.  If local procedures mandate on-site destruction of investigational supply, 
the site should (where local procedures allow) maintain the investigational supply until the study 
monitor inspects the accountability records in order to evaluate compliance and accuracy of accountability by [CONTACT_3878].   At sites where the study drug is destroyed before 
monitor inspection, the monitors rely on documentation of destruction per the site SOP. 
10.3. Data Management  
Data management will be performed in  a validated database via an Electronic Data Capture 
(EDC) system.  All data entry, verification, and validation will be performed in accordance with the current standard operating procedures of the Data Management Department  at the sponsor or 
its designee .  The database will be authorized for lock once all defined procedures are completed. 
The investigator will be provided with access to an EDC system so that an eCRF can be completed for each subject.  Entries made in the eCRF must be verifiable against source 
documents; if updates to the database are not possible, any discrepancies should be explained and documented.  The investigator will be responsible for reviewing all data and eCRF entries, 
and will sign and date the designated forms in each subject' s eCRF, verifying that the 
information is true and correct.  The investigator is responsible for the review and approval of all 
query responses. 
Protocol deviations will be identified and recorded in the Protocol Deviation form  of the eCRF.  
The study monitor will reference the Monitoring Plan in order to ensure that each issue identified

plan's requirements.  
10.4. Data Privacy and Confidenti ality  of Study Records  
The investigator and the sponsor or its designee must adhere to applicable data privacy laws and regulations.  The investigator and the sponsor or its designee are responsible for ensuring that sensitive information is handled in accordance with local requirements (eg, HIPAA).  
Appropriate consent and authorizations for use and disclosure and/or transfer (if applicable) of 
protected information must be obtained. 
Subject names will not be supplied to the sponsor or its designee, if app licable.  Only the subject 
number and subject' s initials (subject 's initials will only be recorded if allowable by [CONTACT_13125]) will be recorded in the e CRF , where permitted; if the subject 's name [CONTACT_169117] (eg, laboratory report), it must be obliterated on the copy of the document to be 
supplied to the sponsor or its designee.  Study findings stored on a computer will be stored in 
accordance with local data protection laws.  The subjects will be informed that representatives of the sponsor or its designee, IRB or IEC, or regulatory authorities may inspect their medical 
records to verify the information collected, and that all personal information made available for inspection will be handled in strictest confidence and in accordanc e with local data protection 
laws.  
10.5. Financial Disclosure

CONFIDENTIAL  APPENDIX B.  ECZEMA AREA AND SEVERITY INDEX 
The EASI score examines 4 areas of the body and weights them for subjects 8 years of age and 
older as follows: 
Head/Neck (H) = 0.1, Upper limbs (UL) = 0.2, Trunk (T) = 0. 3, and Lower limbs  (LL)  = 0.4. 
The percentage of area involved for each of the 4 body regions is weighted as follows:  0 = no eruption, 1 = some to < 10%, 2 = 10% to 29%, 3 = 30% to 49%, 4 = 50% to 69%, 5 = 70% to 
89%, and 6 = 90% to 100%. 
Each of  the 4 body regions is assessed separately for erythema (E), induration/papulation/edema 
(I), excoriations (Ex), and lichenification (L) for an average degree of severity of each sign in 
each region with:  0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, and 3= severe, with half- step allowed.

(INCB 018424 - active control or vehicle) were created with  corresponding alpha level following 
the graphical procedure specified in Section  9.2.  The lower limits of CIs were  compared with 
the critical  values (0 for superiority, and - 10% for noninferiority ) for treatment comparisons.  To 
provide conservative estimates, the primary comparison  (INCB018424 1.5% BID vs vehicle 
superiority) was excluded from  the procedure, that is, only key secondary endpoints were 
evaluated.  
The Type I error rates  are provided in Table E.2  under different null hypotheses.  The rates are

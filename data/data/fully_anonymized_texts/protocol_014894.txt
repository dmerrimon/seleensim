Saline to Identify Epi[INVESTIGATOR_545603]: Peter Pan, MD  
 
Background and Significance:  
Combined spi[INVESTIGATOR_545604] a common form of labor pain relief method that 
provides rapid onset of labor pain relief with the first dose of medicine and also an epi[INVESTIGATOR_545605].   In combined spi[INVESTIGATOR_545606], an epi[INVESTIGATOR_545607].  When the epi[INVESTIGATOR_545608], then a spi[INVESTIGATOR_545609].  
When a drop of clear spi[INVESTIGATOR_545610], the spi[INVESTIGATOR_545611], after which, the 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_545612] a nd an epi[INVESTIGATOR_545613].  When the epi[INVESTIGATOR_545614], anesthesiologists typi[INVESTIGATOR_1306] y attach to the epi[INVESTIGATOR_270388]  a syringe with [ADDRESS_714168] and a spi[INVESTIGATOR_545615].  In combined spi[INVESTIGATOR_545616], an epi[INVESTIGATOR_270388] 
(longer than the standard introducer used in spi[INVESTIGATOR_18227]) is inserted first, and the spi[INVESTIGATOR_545617].  Both spi[INVESTIGATOR_545618].  Many experienced anesthesia care providers

of this study may provide anesthesia provider information on better choice of technique for 
obtaini ng subarachnoid anesthesia in obese patients undergoing cesaraean deliveries.  
 
Purpose:  
 
The purpose of this study is to document the success rate and outcomes of combined spi[INVESTIGATOR_545620].  Additional objectives of this study are to quantify the 
any complications and pain relief and satisfaction assessed by [CONTACT_545635].  
 
Hypothesis:  
Use of saline in combined spi[INVESTIGATOR_545621].  
 
Patient Population:  
 
The patient population will consist of [ADDRESS_714170]  neuraxial labor analgesia.  Emancipated minor s may also be 
enrolled in this protocol .  Exclusion criteria will be American Society of Anesthesiologists 
physica l status greater than II.  
 
Procedures and Methods:  
 
Demographic data including patient’s age, height, weight, gestation, medications and history of 
previous epi[INVESTIGATOR_545622].  Patients will be randomized into one of two 
treatment group s (Group Air or Group Saline) according to a table of random numbers. The 
patient will be placed in the sitting position and a midline approach will be used as in usual 
practice. Combined spi[INVESTIGATOR_545623] r, with 
group Air using [ADDRESS_714171] providing the care.  Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] 10 -20 
mcg of fentanyl with or without bupi[INVESTIGATOR_545624] 1 -2.5mg will be administered.   The patients and data 
interpreters wil l be blinded to the treatment group; however, the anesthesiologist performing the 
procedure will not be blinded.  Standard of care monitoring data will be recorded as usual, and 
level of pain relief will be obtained via pain scores by [CONTACT_545636] n scores.

RANDOMIZATION AND TREATMENT : Patients will be randomized to have the anesthesiologist 
using saline or air for identifying epi[INVESTIGATOR_545625] e. The chance of using air or 
saline is each 50%.  The patients, data interpreters and analyzers will be blinded as to which 
group the patient is assigned to.  
 
Confidentiality:  All information obtained while you are in this study, as well as related hospit al 
records, will be made available to the research staff and other regulatory authorities including the 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  All information will be treated in a confidential manner 
and although the results of this research project may be p resented at meetin gs or in publications, 
you will only referred to by [CONTACT_545637].  
 
SAFETY MEASURES :  Standard monitoring will be applied in the labor room as in usual clinical 
practice at Forsyth M edical Center.  Unless other untowards effects are observed from the 
techniques, no additional monitoring will not be instituted.  
 
OUTCOME MEASURES : The primary outcome measure will be the success or failure of the 
combined spi[INVESTIGATOR_545626].   Secondary outcome measures are any complication or 
side effects.  
 
Benefits and Risks:  
 
There may be no potential benefits from participating in this study other than more frequent 
assessment and observation.  It is not known which technique actually pro vide the more 
favorable outcomes but both techniques are commonly used in clinical practice. The usual risks 
of combined spi[INVESTIGATOR_545627] : headache, failure of the 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_476893], intravenous catheter insertio n and the extremely rare risks of bleeding, 
infection, nerve damage, paralysis, hypotension, high spi[INVESTIGATOR_545628].  All 
these risks are explained by [CONTACT_545638] n euraxial block.  
  
Statistics and Data Analysis:  
 
Data will be presented as mean (SD) or median as appropriate.   Pain VAS scores will be 
examined, following tests for normality, by [CONTACT_545639] -way ANOVA in most study 
designs. Incidence data will b e analyzed by [CONTACT_177610] -Square or Fishers Exact Test. In the case of 
subject drop out, both intent to treat and completed treatment analyses will be performed.  
Continuous data will be compared by [CONTACT_66281] t -test and ANOVA.  Assuming a difference in 
success rate  of 95% versus 85% between the two groups, a sample size of 160/group is required 
to achieve a power of 0.8 and an alpha of 0.05.  An estimate of 175/ groups or 350 total 
evaluable subjects will be enrolled in this study.

  10/11/[ADDRESS_714172]  
 
This study will b e performed in the Sara Lee Women’s Center at Forsyth Medical Center, which 
includes monitoring and resusci tation equipment and trained nursing support staff. All studies 
will be approved by [CONTACT_545640]. The Project Inve stigators 
have all performed similar studies in patients. The purpose of the study and all risks will be 
discussed with each subject, and all questions will be answered prior to obtaining written 
informed consent. Risks to be discussed include discomfort w ith needle and catheter insertion, 
risk of postdural puncture headache and spi[INVESTIGATOR_545629]. The usual side effects and risks 
of spi[INVESTIGATOR_545630] -epi[INVESTIGATOR_545631].  These include itching, nausea, 
hypotension, unilateral pain relie f, small risk of spi[INVESTIGATOR_122499], headache, bleeding, infection, venous 
catheter, high block or inadequate block.  All data acquired will remain confidential with no 
reference to individuals in publications.    
 
Data Safety Monitoring Plan  
 
These monitoring will  be performed with a data safety monitoring board (Laura Dean, MD and 
David Merrill, PhD., MD), who are not involved in the study.  Data and adverse events will be 
reported to these individuals, and reviewed on a regular basis.  Adverse events will also be  
reported to the IRB.   Serious adverse events will be reported to all of these groups and the data 
safety monitoring individuals within 24 hr and the trials halted until feedback is obtained from 
each.

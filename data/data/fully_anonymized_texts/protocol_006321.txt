Title: Randomized, Double- Blind, Sham-Controlled, 
Prospective, Multi-Center P ilot Study to Evaluate the 
Safety and Effectiveness of Duodenal Mucosal Resurfacing (DMR) Using the Revita™ System in the Treatment of Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) 
 
Short Title: The Revita™ US Pi[INVESTIGATOR_303304]#: C-[ZIP_CODE]  
 
Device: The Fractyl Revita™ System is an endoscopic treatment 
consisting of a single catheter and console designed to lift the 
duodenal mucosa with saline followed by [CONTACT_303363].   
 
Study Objectives: The study objectives are: 
 to assess the safety of the Fractyl Revita™ System for the 
treatment of subjects with  type 2 diabetes (T2D) 
suboptimally controlled on 2 to 3 oral antidiabetic medications (OADs) 
 to assess the effect of Duodenal Mucosal Resurfacing 
(DMR) versus Sham procedu res on glycemic endpoints 
24 weeks after the procedure  
Study Design: Randomized, double-blind sham-controlled prospective 
multicenter clinical investi gation of subjects with T2D 
suboptimally controlled on [ADDRESS_370369]-randomizat ion study duration will be up 
to 48 weeks. 
 
 Up to 6 Study Sites in the US 
 Maximum of 9 enrolled subj ects, with 2:1 randomization 
scheme  
 4 week OAD Run-In Period to assess stability of blood 
glucose control in conjunction with medication compliance and lifestyle (diet, exercise) counseling 
 OADs will be held constant fr om start of Run-In Period 
through Week 24, with protocol  pre-specified treatment 
algorithms for hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia. Note: Subjects on SU medications wi ll be provided with specific 
instructions regarding their medication usage pre- and 
post-DMR/Sham proc edure (See 5.3.1). 
 Following OAD Run-In Period,  subjects will be scheduled 
for an endoscopic evaluation consistin
g of an assessment 
 
Protocol # C-[ZIP_CODE] Version 3.0 
Revision Date: [ADDRESS_370370] from having the index procedure (DMR or Sham).   
 Following confirmation of elig ibility during the endoscopic 
evaluation, subjects will be randomized to receive either the DMR or Sham procedur e, and post-procedure, will 
return for follow-up visits  as per visit schedule. 
 Unblinding will occur at Week 24: 
o Sham treatment arm subjec ts who accept the offer 
of crossover will receive DMR treatment at Week [ADDRESS_370371]-procedure  
o Their antidiabetic m edications will be held 
constant from Week 24 through Week 48 with protocol pre-s pecified treatment 
algorithms for hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia 
o Subjects will continue to receive lifestyle 
(diet, exercise) counseling 
o DMR treatment arm will continue to receive lifestyle 
(diet, exercise) counseling through Week 24.   
o Their antidiabetic medications will be 
managed with a protocol  pre-specified 
rescue treatment algorithm consistent with 
current diabetes standard of care 
 In subjects randomized to the DMR treatment arm, an 
ablation site biopsy will be performed at Week 24  
 A Data Monitoring Commi ttee (DMC) with pertinent 
expertise will monitor the safety of study subjects on an ongoing basis    
 A Clinical Events Committee (CEC) will adjudicate safety 
endpoints, and provide an unbiased assessment of 
adverse event (AE) relatedness and severity  
 
Indication for Use: The Revita™ System is intended to improve glycemic control 
in conjunction with diet and exercise in patients with T2D who  are inadequately controlled with oral antidiabetic medications.

Revision Date: 9 July, 2020  Page 22 of 96 1 Introduction 
  
1.1 Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) 
T2D is an endocrine disorder that is characterized by [CONTACT_303368] (hyperglycemia) and subsequent va scular complications.  It is a global 
disease of pandemic proportions and, in t he [LOCATION_002] alone, there are over 
25 million patients with T2D and nearly 2 million newly diagnosed patients every 
year (1). T2D is the leading cause of  blindness (due to diabetic retinopathy, 
20,000 cases/year), end -stage renal disease (due to diabetic nephropathy, 
50,000 cases/year), and amputation (due to diabetic neuropathy, 70,000 
cases/year) (2).   
 T2D is a complicated condition and its c haracteristic feature, hyperglycemia, 
manifests through diminished insulin action in the body. This occurs through two main pathogenic drivers: (i) a failure of the pancreat ic beta cells to secrete 
adequate insulin; and (ii) systemic resistanc e to insulin action (termed “insulin 
resistance”). In principle, some pat ients who are genetically predisposed to 
disease worsen their degree of insulin resistance through westernized lifestyle 
behaviors (i.e., excessive caloric consumpt ion of a diet rich in fat and simple 
sugars, and insufficient physical activity).  This insulin resistant state thus 
imposes a persistent and excessive insu lin secretory demand on the pancreatic 
beta cells
 (3,4). Over time, the pancreatic beta cell is unable to sustain its 
capacity to maintain such a high level of insulin secretion, and overt insulin 
secretory failure ensues. The mismatch  between the degree of insulin resistance 
and the insufficient pancreatic insulin pr oduction leads to the onset of frank 
hyperglycemia and clinical diabetes (5).  Unfortunately, once established, the 
disease continues to run a progressive course as pancreatic beta cell reserve 
further and inexorably declines over time. This explains why treatment 
approaches to lower blood glucose early in t he disease invariably fail in the face 
of progressive beta cell failure. This i nevitably results in the typi[INVESTIGATOR_303310], culminating in the advanced state 
of negligible beta cell secretory reserv e and the need for insulin treatment by 
[CONTACT_17838] (6,7). Therefore, an ideal  new treatment approach for T2D would 
intervene before pancreatic beta cell func tion has completely failed with the aim 
of improving insulin sensitivity, and del aying or reducing the progressive decline 
in insulin secretory capacity.  
1.2 Existing Treatment Options 
Existing treatment options for T2D include lifestyle modification, pharmacological 
therapy and bariatric surgery.  
 Lifestyle Modification 
Lifestyle modification (i.e. diet, exercise) is a well-est ablished intervention that is 
a critical first treatment step in T2 D clinical management. Under carefully 
controlled clinical trial conditions, intens ive lifestyle modification exerts metabolic 
benefit in subjects with pre-T2D, as  demonstrated in the Diabetes Prevention 
 
Protocol # C-[ZIP_CODE] Version 3.0 
Revision Date: 9 July, 2020  Page 23 of 96 Program (DPP)  (8,9) and in patients with T2D (10,11). However, lifestyle 
modification alone is a largely ineffect ive treatment approach in a real world 
setting in large part due to patient non- compliance over the long term (12).  
 
 Pharmacological Intervention  
Pharmacological intervention is the ma instay of diabetes management, with 
approximately 45 anti-diabetes  therapeutics currently available in the US. 
Unfortunately, like lifestyle modifica tion, patient non-compliance renders this 
extensive treatment resource only partial ly effective. As illustration, a large 
segment of the US T2D population rema ins in sub-optimal glycemic control 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_303311] a wide array of  pharmacological opt ions (13,14).  
Pharmacological treatment of T2D is predominantly founded on increasing insulin 
action to limit hyperglycemia.  This is  accomplished by [CONTACT_5640] (1) increasing 
insulin availability through stimulating endogenous secretion from the pancreatic 
beta cells or, in advanced disease, by [CONTACT_303369], or (2) 
increasing the body’s sensitivity to insu lin action, in other words, insulin 
sensitization. Pharmacological intervent ion is also founded on pragmatic ease of 
implementation and patient acceptance, w here orally administered therapi[INVESTIGATOR_303312] (i.e., Glucagon-like peptide [ADDRESS_370387] [GLP-1RA], insulins). 
 
Increasing insulin availability  is realized through well-established 
pharmacological therapy classes, the sulphonylureas (SUs), GLP-1RAs, and 
insulin, but two of the three classes (S Us and insulin) do so with potential for 
causing abnormally excessive circulating insulin levels that can expose patients 
to the harmful effects of hypoglycemia.  It is well-established that iatrogenic 
hypoglycemia in T2D, through use of eit her SU or insulin, is associated with 
detrimental consequences, namely cardiovascular complications and death (15-18). It is also speculated that the exce ssive hyperinsulinemia observed with both 
treatment classes, in particular with exogenous insulin use, stimulates abnormal 
lipogenesis, and this results in weight gain through increased adiposity and increased abnormal fat deposition in crit ical end organs, such as the liver, 
thereby [CONTACT_303370]-existent fatty liver disease (19-21).  Insulin sensitization  can be elicited by [CONTACT_10070]-establis hed interventions (lifestyle 
[diet and exercise], metformin , thiazolidinediones [TZD s]) that result in an 
improvement in overall glycemia. This improvement in glycemia can be observed 
at all stages of T2D: in conjunction with insulin secretagogues or exogenous insulin later in the disease, or to prev ent the progression of  beta cell failure when 
used earlier in the disease (22). It is also  recognized that insulin sensitization is 
often accompanied by [CONTACT_303371] (e.g., cardiovascular system, liver, and ovar y) (23-25). With the TZD class as 
illustration, positive effects have been reported on blood pre ssure, improvements 
in fatty liver disease manifestations, and a return to ovulation in anovulatory 
females (26).

in regulating metabolic homeostasis (27, 28).  It has been shown to exert durable 
improvements in glycemic control that are superior to that achieved with 
optimized pharmacological ther apy (29,30). However, the notion of surgery itself 
and its attendant risks, as well as limited surgical capacity, limits the role of 
bariatric surgery to impac t population-level disease. 
 
1.3 Summary of Limitations of Current Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] 
A number of barriers are acknowledged as impediment s to achieving optimal 
glycemic control in T2D with currently available treatment options at both the 
patient and population level.  
 
 By [CONTACT_303372]/Compliance 
The treatment of T2D is notabl e in that the majority, if not all, of the available 
interventions require some level of co mpliance on the part of the individual 
patient on a daily basis (e.g., administ ering oral medications or injections, 
sometimes multiple times per day, exer cising, eating healthy meals and snacks, 
blood glucose monitoring). Non-compliance therefore limits great ly the impact of 
lifestyle modification and most of the pharmacological therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]; and the more 
complex and labor intensive a given treat ment (e.g., exogenous insulin) the more 
it diminishes real world impact (31). Bariatric surgery has emerged as a very 
different treatment approach involving a si ngle point in time intervention that 
exerts a powerful impact on metabolism.  It is of course counterbalanced by [CONTACT_303373]-term effects of an actual surgic al procedure and the significant risk of post-
surgical complications, but it neverthel ess offers a transformative treatment 
approach that circumvents many  of the issues of patient  compliance (32,33).

contribute to real world non-compliance.

 By [CONTACT_303375] a nd Treatment Continuum 
T2D is a progressive disease and currently  available pharmaco logical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_303313], and this 
results in an inability to alter the inexorabl e course of the disease. In other words, 
pharmacological treatment has been lar gely designed to limit the metabolic 
manifestation of clinical diabetes (hyper glycemia) but without treating the actual 
underlying disease. The average pat ient therefore requires more 
pharmacological treatment over  time to control hyperglyce mia, culminating in the 
eventual transition to insulin treatment (34, 35). The final step to insulin treatment 
is especially problematic in that subjects  resist this final therapeutic step as the 
treatment itself carries gr eat negative stigma; it is har d to implement in a real 
world setting especially among patients wi th multiple chronic diseases and 
multiple concomitant chronic medica tions (see above), and there are inherent 
harmful side effects of insulin therapy t hat are often experienced by [CONTACT_102] 
(e.g., hypoglycemia, fluid retent ion, weight gain) (36-38).  
 In summary, the management of T2D, des pi[INVESTIGATOR_303314], is impeded, given that (i) patient non-comp liance limits treatment 
success at all parts of the disease cont inuum, (ii) the ava ilable treatments only 
treat the metabolic cons equence of the disease (hy perglycemia) and not the 
underlying disease itself, (iii) the availabl e treatments are unable to safely correct 
hyperglycemia in a large segment of the population, and (iv) aversion to insulin 
use means patients suffer needlessly with  prolonged hyperglycemia pre-insulin 
use.

bariatric surgery.  DMR, using the Revita™ System, is desi gned to mimic the metabolic benefit of 
the duodenal exclusion compone nt of bariatric surger y, thereby [CONTACT_303376].  The clinical data gathered thus far indicate that DMR 
exerts a likely insulin sensitizing effe ct as evidenced by a lowering of 
Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insuli n Resistance (HOMA-IR), an insulin 
sensitizing metabolic signature [CONTACT_3265] [CONTACT_303377] (e.g., lowering of α-
hydroxybutyrate, diacylglycerol, and peroxid ase activity), and other related insulin 
 
Protocol # C-[ZIP_CODE] Version 3.0 
Revision Date: 9 July, 2020  Page 26 of 96 sensitizing biomarker effects (incl uding lowered hepatic transaminases and 
urinary albumin).  Unlike bariatric surgery, which involv es an anatomical by[CONTACT_303378] i ngested nutrients to the surf ace of that portion of 
the GI tract, DMR is designed to ablate and resurface the duodenal mucosal 
surface, thus allowing nutrients to be exposed to a resurfaced local mucosa. This infers that the duodenal mucosa surfac e is in some way abnormal in insulin 
resistant T2D subjects and is therefore em anating a potential ‘insulin resisting’ 
effect.  This notion is supported by  [CONTACT_303379]:  
 (i) the duodenum undergoes a maladaptiv e hypertrophic response when 
exposed to unhealthy nutrients (i.e ., fat, simple sugars);  
(ii) this change appears to be associat ed with an augmented insulin resistant 
signal emanating from this portion of the bowel;  
(iii) this signal appears to be persistent and reversible in T2D, as revealed in 
patients after bariatric sur gery:  in patients in w hom metabolic improvement 
has been established after surgery, t he acute re-exposure of the by[CONTACT_303380] t he insulin resistant, hyperglycemic,  
dysmetabolic condition that had existed pre-surgery; and 
(iv) ablation technology ap plied to other tissue surf aces has shown that the 
natural tissue response to ablation is  re-growth with subsequent healthy 
tissue surface formation (39-41) 
 
Taken together, there is  a strong rationale that the duodenal mucosa of T2D 
subjects is in some way abnormal and that subjects would likely reap metabolic benefit if the local duodenal mucosa is re surfaced through an ablation technique.  
Preliminary clinical data gathered in ~100 patients treated with the Revita™ 
System (discussed in Section 1.7) suggest that DMR does indeed exert a glycemic improvement in T2D subjects, which appears to be mediated through an insulin sensitizing mechanism. The goal of the proposed pi[INVESTIGATOR_303315]  T2D subjects in a controlled clinical 
setting to better characterize its safety and effectiveness profile.  The Fractyl Revita™ System has achiev ed CE-marking and allows physicians to 
safely and effectively ablate the duodenal mucosa in patients with T2D. This 
procedure decreases hyperglycemia in t hese patients, thereby [CONTACT_303381]. Further study of the Fractyl Revita™ 
System in patients with T2D will add impor tant new data regarding tolerability, 
efficacy and safety of the DMR procedur e compared to a s ham-treated control 
group, provide both a short- and longer-t erm metabolic and safety perspective, 
and better characterize the intended user population.  
 
1.5 Fractyl Revita
TM System 
The Fractyl Revita™ System consists of two main components:  the Revita™ 
Catheter and a Console.  
 
Protocol # C-[ZIP_CODE] Version 3.0 
Revision Date: 9 July, 2020  Page 27 of 96  
Revita™ Catheter: 
The Revita™ Catheter is a sterile, single use device that is de livered transorally 
over a guidewire into the duodenum usi ng standard techniques, by a therapeutic 
endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_541], and performs two fu nctions: 1) injects saline into the submucosa of 
the duodenum to create a thermal barrier wh ile also lifting the mucosa with saline 
to create a more uniform surface for ablat ion; and 2) ablates the mucosal surface 
using heated water recirculating inside a balloon.   To achieve its function, the Revita™ Cat heter is construct ed of a multi-lumen 
shaft with a balloon affixed to its distal end. Affixed to the outside of the balloon 
are three narrow shafts, each with a port, that are used to draw a vacuum when 
placing the saline durin g the mucosal lifting portion of  the procedure. Within each 
shaft is a fluid lumen with a miniaturized needle affixed to the distal end. Each 
needle is wholly contained wit hin the port ensuring its safe use. During the 
mucosal lift, the tissue is drawn into t he needle port, and saline is injected into 
the submucosal space through the needles.  The proximal end of the shaft is 
fitted with a handle and saline and vacuum lines  that are affixed to a console unit 
to control its function.  The catheter is available with a 24 mm outer diameter 
(OD) balloon.   Console: 
The console is a reusable electro-mec hanical pi[INVESTIGATOR_303316].  The consol e continuously monitors 
its performance to detect fault conditions  and mitigate risks to the patient. The 
console is controlled by [CONTACT_303382] a software user interface 
monitor. Prior to use, the console is fi tted with a sterile singl e use line set that 
serves as the pathway for the saline to be placed into the duodenal submucosa 
during the procedure.   
1.6 DMR Procedure 
The DMR procedure using the Revita™ S ystem is completed in the endoscopy 
suite or in an operating room using eit her general anesthesia by a physician who 
is trained in therapeutic endoscopic procedur es involving the use of a guidewire. 
The patient is positioned in the left la teral decubitus position used for endoscopic 
procedures or preferred position as di ctated by [CONTACT_779]’s requirements for 
endoscopic procedures. A standard endoscope is used to complete an initial endoscopic evaluation and a guidewire is deliv ered past the ligament of Treitz to 
assist in delivering the catheter. Anti -peristaltic agents may be used during the 
procedure. Catheter deliver y and device location for treatment is verified using 
fluoroscopic guidance. The use of fluorosc opy is limited to use during catheter 
placement and verification of location duri ng treatment.  Based on data collected 
during earlier clinical investigations, the duration of radiation exposure is 
approximately equivalent to  that delivered during an endoscopic retrograde 
cholangiopancreatography pr ocedure, which is a common endoscopic procedure 
 
Protocol # C-[ZIP_CODE] Version 3.0 
Revision Date: 9 July, 2020  Page 28 of 96 with an acceptable safety profile. The to tal procedure time is approximately 30 
minutes.     Mucosal Lift and Ablation Procedure The Revita™ catheter is placed in the proximal duodenum distal to the papi[INVESTIGATOR_9387]. 
Both mucosal lift and mucosal ablation of the duodenum are commonly performed in the endoscopy suite, and the Revita™ System is designed to enable a highly controlled lift and ablation of the post-papi[INVESTIGATOR_303317].  Using 
the console interface, the balloon is in flated and vacuum delivered to draw  the 
intestinal mucosal tissue into the ports located on the balloon. The actuator on 
the handle is moved to advance the needle into the submucosal space within 
each of the ports. The console delivers  saline colored with methylene blue or 
similar dye into the submucosa through the needles within the lumens of the 
catheter resulting in complete circumfer ential lift of the mucosa. Once complete, 
the ablation cycle is start ed and hot water is circulated into the balloon to 
complete an ablation of the previously expanded tissue. The balloon is deflated 
and the catheter repositioned distally to  the next segment to be treated. The 
process of expansion, abl ation and reposit ioning is repeated until the needed 
length is treated. A full DMR procedure is defined as 5 complete ablations 
representing 10 axial centim eters of circumferentially  ablated tissue in the 
duodenum. The Revita™ catheter and endoscope are then removed.  
 
1.[ADDRESS_370390] in human clinical investigati on (C-[ZIP_CODE]) began in August 2013 at a single 
site in Santiago, Chile and enrolled 57 subjects. The objective of this 
investigation was to evaluat e initial feasibilit y and the safety profile of the DMR 
procedure using the Revita™ System, and its effect on subjects with T2D. 
Efficacy was evaluated with FPG and A1c levels. Safety data included 
volunteered/elicited AEs and their relatedness to  the study device or  procedure.     
Early in the course of the study, thr ee SAEs of duodenal stenosis were reported. 
All resolved without sequelae. As correct ive action, procedural and catheter 
modifications were implemented with no fu rther reports of stenosis across the 
entire Revita™ clinical progr am to date. An additional SA E of jejunal perforation 
during catheter placement and prior to abl ation, was noted. The most frequent 
AEs were GI-related (abdominal distenti on, abdominal pain, change of bowel 
habit and diarrhea). They occurred early  following the procedure, were 
predominately mild in severity, and re solved early during the post-operative 
period, all without sequel ae. Although the study was conducted primarily to 
demonstrate safety, A1c and FPG lo wering and HOMA-IR improvement 
suggested significant improvement in t he metabolic derangements of diabetes 
(42).   A second single arm, open label evaluation has enrolled 46 subjects in Europe 
and South America (C-[ZIP_CODE]). The objective of  this multi-center trial  was to 
verify that the results seen in C-[ZIP_CODE] at a single center  were generalizable to a 
broader population across Europe, in addition  to South America . There were no

(38°) with C-reactive protein (CRP) elev ation, occurred the day after DMR and 
required one extra day of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].   Consistent with the C-[ADDRESS_370391] procedure; they were 
transient and generally mild. Effectivene ss was demonstrated by a robust mean 
improvement in A1c of 1.0% at 24 weeks,  with 71.1% of subjects achieving an 
improvement of at least 0.5%; mean FPG lowering of 35.7 mg/dL; a durable 
glycemic response over 52 weeks of obs ervation; and a clinically-relevant 
decrease in HOMA-IR.    C-[ZIP_CODE], a randomized double-blind sham-c ontrolled prospective multicenter 
clinical investigation in up to 120 T2D s ubjects was initiated in Europe and Brazil 
in Q2 2017, and includes mechanistic studi es as well as safety and effectiveness 
assessments.  
1.8 Risk Analysis 
There are certain residual risks associated with the use of the Fractyl Revita™ 
System and the DMR procedur e. AEs that may result from the DMR System 
include those commonly associated with gastrointestinal endoscopy procedures, 
as well as device-related AEs: potential acute and chronic adverse 
consequences of the device-induced duodenal ablation treat ment, or those 
resulting from device malfunction, device user error, selected materials, device 
design or device construction.  Some AEs may be associated with both the procedure and the device. In addition, device malfunctions may occur which may or may not result in a device-related AE. The Instructions for Use (IFU) provide a 
listing of these device-related residual risks.  Below is a listing of these risks, the 
means by [CONTACT_303383], as well as a justification for conducting the study. 
 
 Procedure Risks 
Potential AEs associated with the endoscopic procedure and sedation include 
the following (in al phabetical order):  
• Abdominal cramps, discomfort, or pain 
• Allergic or adverse reacti on to sedation or anesthesia 
• Abdominal bloating • Cardiac or respi[INVESTIGATOR_13374] • Death  • Delayed gastric emptying  • Dental injury • Difficulty swallowing • Digestive tract injury or perforation • Fever • Gastrointestinal bleeding • Headache • Hyperglycemia • Hypoglycemia

• Hypoxia • Impaired judgment or reactions • Indigestion • Infection • Injury to esophagus • Laryngospasm • Mucosal injury to GI tract  • Nausea  • Pancreatitis • Perforation • Pneumoperitoneum • Pulmonary aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516] • Sore or irritated throat  • Vomiting 
 
Many of these risks and complications a ssociated with the procedure are similar 
to those associated with other commonl y performed endoscopic procedures with 
sedation, such as duodenal biopsies and endoscopic mucosal resection.   
 
 Device Risks 
 Potential AEs associated with the device include the following:   
 Abdominal cramps, discomfort, or pain 
 Abscess formation 
 Allergic reaction to the device materials or methylene blue  
 Death  
 Delayed gastric emptying  
 Diarrhea 
 Digestive tract injury 
 Duodenal stenosis 
 Fever 
 Gastric dumpi[INVESTIGATOR_80565] 
 Gastritis 
 Gastrointestinal bleeding 
 Hyperglycemia 
 Hypoglycemia 
 Infection 
 Mucosal injury to GI tract  
 Nausea  
 Nutritional malabsorption 
 Pancreatitis 
 Perforation 
 Stomach or duodenal obstruction  
 Stricture  
 
Protocol # C-[ZIP_CODE] Version 3.0 
Revision Date: 9 July, 2020  Page 31 of 96  Structural damage to the GI tract 
 Thermal damage to the duodenum wa ll or surrounding structures 
 Ulcer 
 Vomiting 
 
Device malfunctions that lead to device-related AEs include:  
 Console delivers incorrect ablation ti me and temperature profile resulting 
in GI tract injury or perforation 
 Hole in hot fluid catheter balloon re sulting in leakage of hot fluid that 
results in GI tract injury or perforation  
 Lost catheter component in t he GI tract or wall that re sults in GI tract injury 
or perforation 
 Device malfunctions that may or may not result in device-related AEs include: 
 Component degradation  
 Device breakage  
 Device disarticulation  
 
 Minimizing Study Risks 
The following steps have been taken to minimize risks associated with the procedure and the use of the Fractyl Revita™ System: 
 
 The tissue or fluid contact[CONTACT_303384]™ Catheter are known medica l-grade materials that are well-
characterized and have a long history of  use. In addition, biocompatibility 
testing has proven that the materials are safe. 
 The device design uses known technologies including sub-mucosal 
injection and hot fluid balloon to complete the procedure. Similar 
technologies are currently in use for such accepted procedures as endoscopic mucosal resection and treatment of menorrhagia.  
 The device design has been rigorously tested in the laboratory, animal 
models and clinical trials to charac terize its performance and confirm the 
safety and performance of the procedure. 
 All endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_303318]™ 
System and the DMR procedure. The tr aining includes hands-on use of 
the system in a lab setting. 
 
 Justification for Investigation 
As with any medical device developed for use in a procedure, there are risks 
associated with the Fractyl Revita™ S ystem and the DMR pr ocedure. Many of 
these risks are similar to those seen wi th other endoscopic devices that are 
passed either over the wire or th rough an endoscope for treatment in the 
esophagus, stomach or duodenum. The risk profile of such devices in the hands

Revision Date: 9 July, 2020  Page 32 of 96 (e.g. use of endoscopic guidewires), im proved endoscopic visualization, and 
improved fluoroscopic capabilities in endoscopic suites. From a procedural 
standpoint, devices such as achalasia- pneumodilatation balloons, injection 
needles, RF ablation devices and endosco pic mucosal resection systems have 
shown a satisfactory history of safe and effective clinical use. Attempts have 
been made to limit procedural risks by [CONTACT_303385]/exclusion criteria, having the 
DMR procedure conducted only by [CONTACT_303386], and by [CONTACT_303387]-on animal labs. In addition, appropriate steps have been taken to minimize the risks associated with the device desi gn and materials, as listed above.   
 The medical consequences and morbidity associated with T2D have been well studied and documented, and include mi crovascular and macrovascular 
complications such as renal failure, blindness, peripheral neuropathy, amputation, increased risk of  myocardial infarctions, stroke, and peripheral 
vascular disease. A successful DMR proc edure is expected to lower A1c in T2D 
patients with inadequate glycemic contro l despi[INVESTIGATOR_303320]-
lowering medications, given its potentia l for increasing insulin sensitivity and 
action, thereby [CONTACT_303388]. In addition to its beneficial e ffect on the pathophysiological drivers of 
metabolic dysfunction, the DMR procedur e has a key therapeutic advantage in 
that its effectiveness is not complianc e-dependent, in contrast to all other 
currently available T2D therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Bec ause poor adherence to medications is a 
significant barrier to glycemic control in  the general population, a DMR procedure 
which does not require daily complianc e with additional medi cations may prove 
to be particularly helpful in achieving superior real world results, as has been 
observed with bariatric surgery. In conj unction with an appropriate lifestyle  (eg, 
healthy diet, exercise), a DMR procedur e performed in patients who have not 
achieved target glycemic goals with thei r current regimen of OADs should help 
optimize glycemic control and support endogenous  beta cell function. Removing 
compliance as an impediment to glycemi c control, and given its mechanistic 
plausibility, the DMR pr ocedure and device offer an im portant new therapy to 
patients with T2D to help reduce the morbidity and end-organ damage from this 
debilitating chronic illness.    
 As noted above, there are potential benefits associated with the DMR procedure, 
and the risks associated with the devic e and procedure have been identified and 
minimized where possible. Thus, the benefit/risk profile associated with the 
Revita™ System warrants further clinical re search and justifies this investigation.

2.1 Overview 
In two clinical trials conducted to date, the Fractyl Revita™ System has been studied as an open-label device intervention without a pre-specif ied control arm. 
Additionally, the first randomized, double-blind, s ham controlled study was 
initiated in Q2, 2017 in Europe and South Am erica and is in the process of being 
closed out.  The US Pi[INVESTIGATOR_9962] a prospective, randomized, double-blind (subject and 
endocrinologist), 24-week, sham-controlled, mu lti-center, pi[INVESTIGATOR_303321] a maximum 
of [ADDRESS_370392] be metformin. The ra ndomization scheme will be 2:1 DMR 
treatment:Sham procedure. To tal post-randomization study duration will be 24 
weeks for DMR subjects and 48 weeks fo r Sham subjects who undergo the 
crossover procedure within 21 days of Week 24 visit.  All eligible subjects will participate in  a 4-week antidiabetic medication Run-In 
Period before randomization to the index procedure to assess stability of blood 
glucose control in conjunction with medication compliance and lifestyle (diet, exercise) counseling. OADs will be held co nstant from start of Run-In Period 
through Week 24, with protocol pre- specified treatment algorithms for 
hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia.   Following the medication run-in peri od, subjects will be scheduled for an 
endoscopic evaluation consisting of an asse ssment of the esophagus, stomach, 
duodenum and associated structures to ens ure there are no conditions that 
would exclude the subject from having t he index procedure (DMR or Sham).  
   Following confirmation of s ubject eligibility during the endoscopic evaluation, 
subjects will be randomized to receiv e the DMR or Sham procedure. Post 
procedure the subjects will be required to re turn for follow-up visits as per visit 
schedule.  Both treatment arms will be followed up fo r a total of [ADDRESS_370393] the DMR study  will be withdrawn 
from the study.  
  On an ongoing basis, study subjects will be provided with healthy lifestyle counseling to educate them on the importance of exercise and diet in relation to

Visit and will be instructed how to perfo rm  self-monitoring of blood glucose 
(SMBG) at a schedule as outlined in Se ction 6.10. Subjects will be provided 
diaries in which they will record any changes in medication use, SMBG results, and any symptoms of hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia.  Study assessments include: A1c, FPG, ALT, AST, UACR, Duodenal mucosal 
biopsy, MRE, SF-36 Ques tionnaire, PROMIS®.  
 Subject follow up visits conducted by [CONTACT_303389] [ADDRESS_370394] procedure. A summary of the

2.3 Intended Use 
The Fractyl Revita™ System is intended to improve glycemic control in conjunction with diet and exercise in patients with T2D w ho are inadequately 
controlled with oral anti diabetic medications.  
 
2.4 Study Objectives 
The study objectives are: 
 to assess the safety of the Fractyl Revita™ System for the treatment of 
subjects with T2D suboptimally cont rolled on 2 to 3 oral antidiabetic 
medications  
 to assess the effect of DMR ve rsus Sham procedures on glycemic

 Samples will be embedded in paraffin, and thin samples of each biopsy will be stained (hematoxylin and eosin; trichr ome) to assess mucosal regrowth, 
inflammation and fibrosis using a 0- 4 ordinal scoring system. The following 
assessments will be made comparing t he ablated biopsies to the control: 
 Villous Formation 
 Acute Inflammation 
 Chronic Inflammation 
 Fibrosis 
The biopsy specimen will be analyzed at  a central pathology laboratory in 
accordance with Good Laboratory Practice Regulations under the direction of a 
Board Certified Pathologist.  
 
 For Subjects Treated with the Sham Procedure 
At the Week [ADDRESS_370450] the same evaluations as the subj ects in the DMR tr eatment group listed 
above, except  for the 24 Week Follow-up en doscopy, endoscopic evaluation and 
biopsy. For subjects who accept the o ffer to crossover, the Endoscopy / DMR 
procedure will be scheduled within 21 days of this Week 24 Visit.   During the time 
between the Week 24 Visit and the crossove r to DMR (Visit 3C), medications 
should be held stable. Prior to the procedur e, subjects who are on SU medication 
will be instructed by [CONTACT_303413]- and post-procedure SU 
management.  They will be asked to take half their regular dose of SUs the day 
before the procedure, and omit  taking any SU the day of the procedure.

Note: Subjects that choose not to crossover from sham to DMR will be 
discontinued (withdrawn) from the study and the E nd of Study eCRFs will be 
completed. 
 
5.13 Visit 3C: Crossover to DMR Visit (+21 days from Visit 12) 
This visit is for Sham subjects onl y. The endoscopy and the DMR procedure will 
be completed at this visit. A video of t he procedure will be obtained, as well as 
any Investigator notes detailing their observations.  
 
Once a Sham subject is treated with the DMR procedure, these subjects 
complete follow-up study Visits 4 (Day 7) through 12 (Week 24) as described in 
the protocol in Sections 5.4 through 5.12 (which are referred to as Visits 4C – 
12C for the Sham crossover group). Thes e visits after the crossover to DMR 
include the exact same assessments as the initial visits and these crossover 
subjects will now be following the same  visit schedule as a subject that was 
initially randomized to DMR.   
 Note: Subjects randomized to Sham who crossover to DMR but do not receive 
any ablations during the DMR procedure will have all clinical findings 
documented, and will be followed through the [ADDRESS_370451] crossover visit and 
then discontinued from the study.  
5.14 COVID-19 Exceptions 
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, in-clinic  assessments, follow up endoscopic 
evaluations, biopsies and crossover proc edures may not be offered to subjects 
unless the following cr iteria are met: 
 It is safe for subj ects, site staff, and Sponsor Proctor (for crossover visits 
only) to travel to the study site during the given window  
 The study site allows on-site clinic al research activities and elective 
procedures 
 If both of these criteria are not met and subjects are unable to be seen on site, 
the study team will contact [CONTACT_303414] 24.

 Physician Discretion: the investig ator determines that, for medical 
reasons, it is in the best interest of the subject to discontinue 
participation in the study.  If an AE or SAE occurs that could affect the 
subject’s safety or well-being, this should be documented in the eCRF as a reason for a subject’s study  participation di scontinuation. 
 Lost to Follow-Up:  Unable to locate the subject despi[INVESTIGATOR_303333], email or mail.    
 Subject Withdrawal:  The subjec t requests to terminate his/her 
involvement in the study, therefor e withdrawing his/her consent to 
participate in the study (the invest igator must thoroughly document the 
reasons for termination, making all e ffort to obtain information about 
possible underlying AEs leading to t he decision to withdraw from study 
participation).  
 Death:  If possible, an autopsy and/or death certif icate should be 
obtained in order to document  the cause of death. 
 
All subjects enrolled in the clinical st udy (including those withdrawn from the 
clinical study or lost to follow-up) shall be accounted for and documented. If a 
subject withdraws from the clinical in vestigation, the reason(s) shall be

diet in relation to blood glucose contro l.  Compliance with diet and lifestyle 
recommendations will be discussed with the subject throughout the study and 
specifically in the case of insufficient gl ycemic control. The details are provided in 
the Study Reference Manual.  
6.8 SF-36 Quality of Life Questionnaire 
Subjects will complete an assessment of he alth status and qualit y of life, the SF-
36 Questionnaire, at Baseline, and Weeks 12 and 24. These measures rely upon 
patient self-reporting. The SF-36 asks 36 questions to measure functional health 
and well-being from the patient's point of vi ew. It is a practical, reliable and valid 
measure of physical and mental health t hat can be completed in five to ten 
minutes.  
6.9 PROMIS® (Patient-Reported Outcom es Measurement Information System) 
Subjects will complete the PROMIS® at Baseline, 12 and 24 Week Visits. PROMIS® is a set of person-centered measures that will be used to evaluate 
and monitor physical health in subjects. For the purposes of this study, the 
gastrointestinal symptom domains were  chosen including nausea/vomiting, 
gas/bloating, diarrhea and belly pain. 
 
6.[ADDRESS_370460] Self-Monito ring of Blood Glucose (SMBG) and Glycemia Diary 
Subjects will be provided with a Glycemi a Diary, a home blood glucose meter 
and supplies for use at home during the study, and will be instructed in correct 
SMBG technique. Subjects will measure blood glucoses according to a pre-specified schedule, presented below, and record them in their Glycemia Diary. 
 
 Except as indicated for the Post -Procedure Intensive Monitoring Phase 
(Days 0-14), all subjects will be required to test a fasting (pre-breakfast) 
and a pre-dinner blood glucose level us ing SMBG daily.  In addition, they 
will perform more intensive monitoring of blood glucose, 4 times per day (once pre-breakfast [fasting] AND onc e before lunch, once before dinner, 
and once before bed), on at least 3 days on the week before each clinic 
visit and each telephone visit.   
 
 On Days 0-14 following the DMR pr ocedure (the Post-Procedure Intensive 
Monitoring Phase), subjects will be required to perform more intensive 
monitoring of blood glucose, 4 times per  day (once pre-breakfast [fasting] 
AND once before lunch, once before dinner, and once before bed), every 
single day during this period. 
 
Protocol # C-[ZIP_CODE] Version 3.0 
Revision Date: 9 July, 2020  Page 64 of 96  
 Subjects will be requested to monitor blood glucose levels with increased 
frequency whenever they experience any i llnesses (eg, cold, flu), or have 
symptoms of hyper- or hypoglycemia. 
 Subjects will be instructed to bring their Glycemia Diary to the clinic at every 
study visit, and to scan/fax 7- day records to the site pr ior to each telephone visit. 
 While symptoms of hyper- or hypoglycemi a can be variable across patients with 
diabetes, the symptoms outline below may ty pi[INVESTIGATOR_303334], and should prompt  subjects to perform SMBG more 
frequently:   
Low Blood Glucose Symptoms

 Shaking  
 Sudden mood changes (irritated)  
 Hunger pangs  
 Difficulty speaking  
 Rapid heartbeat  
 Epi[INVESTIGATOR_141064]  
 Loss of consciousness  
 High Blood Glucose Symptoms 
 Frequent urination  
 Increased thirst  
 Dry mouth 
 
 
Below are some symptoms that can apply to both high and low blood glucose: 
 Fatigue  
 Dizziness  
 Headache  
 Distorted vision  
 Nausea  
 Concentration problems  
 Confusion  
 Difficulty standing and walking  
 Muscle spasms  
 Tired and/or weak feeling  
 
6.11 Management of Glycemia a nd Antidiabetic Medication 
While the subjects are in the study, they  will continue seeing their HCPs per their 
customary schedule, or as needed, for all non-glucose related medical issues.  
The management of the s ubjects’ glycemic control will be carried out by [CONTACT_303416], w ho will be guided by [CONTACT_303417] (Section 
6.11.2).  The investigator  will keep the subjects’ HCPs apprised of any diabetes 
medication changes, and may seek their input if needed. At the completion of the 
study, the subjects’ HCPs will resume  full management of their diabetes. 
 
Protocol # C-[ZIP_CODE] Version 3.0 
Revision Date: [ADDRESS_370461]’ s glycemia will be managed by [CONTACT_303418]: 
 Antidiabetic medication use 
 SMBG values as recorded in the Glycemia Diary  
 A1c levels 
 Occurrence of hypoglycemia 
 Symptomatic severe hyperglycemia 
 All study Investigators and study site personnel will be instructed in the 
importance of SMBG, Glycemia Diary review, and meticulous diabetes 
management with lifestyle counseling at t he study visits, especially for subjects 
whose glucose values exceed accepted thresholds (i.e., >180 mg/dL [10.0 mmol/L]). The Investigator will be in structed to probe for factors that may 
contribute to inadequate glycemic control, such as:  
 Compliance with concurrent diabetes therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] 
 Compliance with diet and exercise guidelines 
 Intercurrent disease 
 Subjects will fax/scan their Glycemi a Diary results prior to the telephone 
contacts, and bring their Glycemia Diar ies to every study visit. During these 
telephone and on-site visits, t he SMBG levels recorded in the Glycemia Diary will 
be reviewed, and compliance with concu rrent diabetes therapi[INVESTIGATOR_303335].  Additional lifestyle and nutritional 
counseling will be provided to educate subjects on the importance of diet and 
exercise in relation to blood glucose control.  Antidiabetic medication regime establ ished during the Run-In Period will be 
continued through the index procedure with out change, except for SU use, until 
the Week 24 visit (Visit 12), unless subjects  meet the Study Exclusion criteria as 
outlined in Section 4.1.2, at the Baseline Visit (Post Medication Run-In, Visit 2) or 
unless they meet the on-tr eatment rescue therapy criteria as outlined below. 
Subjects on SU medications at study entry who qualify for the DMR/Sham 
procedure will be instructed to take half their usual dose of SUs the day before 
the DMR/Sham procedure, and no SU inta ke the day of the procedure.  
Following the procedure, subjects on SU medications will be instructed to restart their medicines in an incremental fashi on (step-wise increase to pre-procedure 
dose) guided by [CONTACT_303419] (eg, tolerability of full 
soft diet, calorie intake), by [CONTACT_303420].

The threshold values for rescue treatment will be defined as follows: 
 Baseline up to Week 12: FPG > 220 mg/dL (12.2 mmol/L) 
 Week 12 up to Week 24: FPG >200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) or no 
improvement in A1c from Baseline  
• A confirmatory FPG is to be obtained by [CONTACT_148219]. 
If the confirmatory FPG exceeds the threshold value, the investigator 
will perform an assessment for rescue using the factor s listed below: 
• Blood glucose absolute value compared to rescue threshold 
• Overall trajectory of  FPG re lative to run-in and baseline 
• Isolated incident vs a persistent  elevation in blood sugar  
• Presence or absence of hyperglycemic symptoms  
• Presence or absence of an assignable cause of high blood sugar (e.g. 
intercurrent infection) 
 
At Week 24, subjects who were in the sham-treated group and who accept the 
offer to crossover to the DMR procedure w ill be assessed by [CONTACT_303421].   
 The DMR-treated subjects will be offered re scue therapy at Week [ADDRESS_370463] 
an HbA1c >8% or no improvement in A1 c from baseline, and subsequently will 
be offered treatment escalation at 12-week intervals if their HbA1c levels exceed 
8%.  At the beginning of their study participati on, randomized subjects will be on 2 or 3 
oral antidiabetic medications (OADs), one of which must be metformin. Protocol-
specified guidance on escalation of  treatment based on the above glycemic 
criteria, occurring at 12-week interval s, is outlined in following Table:

Medical Care in Diabetes [ADDRESS_370464] is on submaximal SU dose, that dose can be maintained.  
 
3 The choice of Liraglutide as a rescue agent was made to ensure homogeneity for the 
treatment population and ensure maximum efficacy for patients failing two to three 
OADs.    
 
4 Investigators are advised to follow the package insert for Liraglutide, namely to start at 
0.6mg sc daily for two weeks and then escalate to 1.2mg sc daily thereafter, if 
tolerated, to reduce the risk of GI side effects.  
 
Prior to starting Liraglutide rescue t herapy, a careful GI history should be 
obtained and the presence of nausea, vomi ting or diarrhea be recorded prior to 
the initiation of liraglutide treatment. S ubjects who are not felt to be candidates 
for Liraglutide therapy based on the Inve stigator’s judgement, or who do not 
tolerate the drug, may have an   OAD that  the subject is not taking (TZD or DPP-
4 inhibitor or SGLT2 inhi bitor or SU) added to their regimen, and prescribed as 
per labeled instructions.  For rescue t herapy with SUs, only glipi[INVESTIGATOR_303336].  
 For subjects who may require more intensive diabetes management, investigators will be counseled to cons ider initiating insulin therapy if blood 
glucose is ≥300 mg/dL (16.7 mmol/L) or HbA1C is ≥10% or if the patient has 
persistent symptoms of hyperglycemia (i .e., polyuria or polydipsia). As the 
patient’s glucose toxicity resolves, the r egimen may, potentially, be simplified. If 
subjects remain poorly controlled despi[INVESTIGATOR_303337], they 
will be discontinued from the study.  
 Hypoglycemia Management 
Hypoglycemia is the major limiting factor in the gl ycemic management of both 
T1D and T2D. Subjects entering the Sc reening Phase of the study will be 
identified as having T2D without hypogl ycemia unawareness or a history of 
severe hypoglycemia (more than [ADDRESS_370465] year). During study conduct, however, 
subjects may be at risk of experienci ng hypoglycemia due to the combination of 
background antidiabetic medicati on use and procedure effects.  
 The International Hypoglycaemia St udy Group (2017) has classified  
hypoglycemia as outlined in following Table:  Hypoglycemia Definition and Treatment Guidelines: 
 Hypoglycemia Criteria Description 
 
Protocol # C-[ZIP_CODE] Version 3.0 
Revision Date: 9 July, 2020  Page 68 of 96 Glucose alert value ≤70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) Suffici ently low for treatment with 
fast-acting carbohydrate

clinically important hypoglycemia 
Severe hypoglycemia No specific glucose 
threshold Hypoglycemia associated with 
severe cognitive impairment, requiring external assistance for recover
y 
 During the Run-in Phase (Screening th rough Procedure), hypoglycemia meeting 
the criteria outlined bel ow will be exclusionary. 
 
H
ypoglycemia  Criteria Outcome 
 Any severe hypoglycemic event, defined as 
hypoglycemia requiring third-party 
assistance; or  
 Any clinically significant hypoglycemic 
event, defined as self-monitored or laboratory plasma glucose level < 54 mg/dL (3.0 mmol/L); or  
 ≥ 2 glucose alert values ≤70 mg/dL (3.9 
mmol/L) unless a clear correctable precipi[INVESTIGATOR_303338]
g factor can be identified  Immediate treatment of 
hypoglycemia 
 Subject exclusion from study  
 
Hypoglycemia that occurs following random ization, whether not ed with SMBG or 
due to symptoms, must be recorded in the Glycemia Diary and treated. Glucose 
(15–20 g) is the preferred treatment for the conscious individual with 
hypoglycemia at the glucose alert value of ≤70 mg/dL [3.9 mmol/L]), although 
any form of carbohydrate that contains  glucose may be used. Fifteen minutes 
after treatment, if SMBG shows continued hypoglycemia, the treatment should be 
repeated. Once SMBG-obtained value retu rns to normal, the individual should 
consume a meal or snack to pr event recurrence of hypoglycemia. 
 The use of glucagon is indicated for the treatment of hypoglycemia in people 
unable or unwilling to consume carbohydrat es by [CONTACT_1966]. Glucagon should be 
prescribed for all individuals at incr eased risk of clinically significant 
hypoglycemia, defined as blood glucose <54 mg /dL (3.0 mmol/L), su ch that it is 
available should it be needed.  Patients are instructed to contact [CONTACT_303422] a change in glycemic therapy is required in case one of the following occurs: 
1. any severe hypoglycemic epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865] 2. 2 or more previously unreported epi[INVESTIGATOR_303339] ≤70 mg/dl  
 
 
Protocol # C-[ZIP_CODE] Version 3.0 
Revision Date: [ADDRESS_370466] should 
perform SMBG, and treat if indicated,  as discussed regarding hypoglycemia 
management above (6.11.2).  However, if  it is not possible to obtain a 
confirmatory SMBG value in the setting of symptoms suggestive of 
hypoglycemia, the subject should a ssume the symptoms were due to 
hypoglycemia and should be treat ed. All glucose values ≤70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L), 
and all symptomatic treated epi[INVESTIGATOR_17221], with or without a SMBG 
value, should be recorded in the subj ect’s Glycemia Diary. Information on 
hypoglycemia will be transcribed from t he diary onto the hypoglycemia eCRF 
page by [CONTACT_779]. Because the analysis for hypoglycemia will be based on data recorded on the Hypoglycemia Reporti ng eCRF page and not the AE eCRF 
page, it is requested that t he Investigator not report the hypoglycemic events on 
the AE eCRF page unless the hypoglycemia epi [INVESTIGATOR_303340]. However, the Investigator is not prohibited from characterizing 
hypoglycemia as an AE. Any event of hypoglycemia reported as an AE will be 
cross-checked to ensure that the event  is also reported on the Hypoglycemia 
Reporting eCRF page.   In the case of symptomatic hypoglycemi a or severe hypoglycemia appropriate 
adjustment of antidiabetic therapy, such as a dose reduction / discontinuation of 
ongoing rescue medication or existing ba ckground therapy can be initiated. 
Reduction or discontinuation of ongoing rescue medication should be considered 
before a reduction in the dose of existing background therapy. 
 
6.12 Concomitant Medications 
All concomitant medications will be recor ded at the Screening Visit. The use of 
ongoing and any new medications will then be noted at each following study visit.  
All medication use will be captured in the source documents and on the 
appropriate eCRF page. The following information will be recorded for each 
medication: name, indication, dos e, frequency, start date, end date.

records, death certificate and autopsy report, if performed). 
 
The Investigator or Investigational site will maintain in original format all essential 
study documents and source documentation that support the data collected on 
the subjects in compliance with GCP st andards and all applicable federal, state, 
and local laws, rules and regulations relate d to the conduct of a clinical study.  
Investigator files containing all record s and reports of the in vestigation should be 
retained for a minimum of two years or  longer after approval of a marketing 
application, two years after records are no longer required to support marketing 
application, or at least [ADDRESS_370470] el apsed since the formal discontinuation of 
clinical development of the DMR procedure. It is Fractyl’s responsibility to inform 
the Investigator when these documents no longer need to be maintained. To 
avoid any error, the investigator shoul d contact [CONTACT_303426]. The Investigator will take meas ures to ensure that  these essential 
documents are not accidentally damaged or destroyed. If for any reason the 
Investigator withdraws responsibility for maintaining these essential documents, 
custody must be transferred to an indivi dual who will assume responsibility, and 
Fractyl must receive writt en notification of this custodial change. Notice of 
transfer should be submitted to the FDA not later than 10 working days after the 
Sponsor has been notif ied of the change.

7.8 Adverse Event Reporting 
 
 
Protocol # C-[ZIP_CODE] Version 3.0 
Revision Date: 9 July, 2020  Page 74 of 96 
 Adverse Events (AEs) 
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence,  unintended disease or injury, or any 
untoward clinical sign (including an abnor mal laboratory finding) in subjects, 
users, or other persons, regardless of whether or not it is related to the 
investigational medical device. 
 This definition includes adverse ev ents related to the medical device of 
this investigation. 
 This definition includes adverse ev ents related to the procedures involved 
(any procedures in the clin ical investigational plan) 
 For adverse events involving “users or  other persons”, this definition is 
restricted to adverse events related to the medical device of this 
investigation. 
. Adverse events are classified and tabulat ed by [CONTACT_303430], severity, and body system. Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), deaths and Unanticipated Adverse Device Effects (U ADEs) will be listed separately.   
 The following should not be recorded as AEs: 
 Pre-planned procedure unless the c ondition for which the procedure was 
planned has worsened from t he first study-related activity after the subject 
has signed the informed consent form. 
 Pre-existing conditions found as a result of screening procedures. These 
should be recorded as medical hi story/concomitant illness. 
 Out-of-range laboratory values that are deemed clinically significant by [CONTACT_303431],  Adverse Event information will be reco rded in the eCRF Adverse Event Form. 
AEs, SAEs and UADEs will be coded using MedDRA.   Adverse events are graded on a 3-point sca le and reported as indicated on the 
eCRF. The intensity of an adverse ex perience is defined as follows:  
 
 Mild: Discomfort noticed, but no disr uption to daily activity 
 Moderate: Discomfort sufficient to reduce or affect normal daily activity  
 Severe: Inability to work or perform normal daily activity 
 Study Procedure and Device Relationship: the relationship of an adverse event 
to the device and to the procedure will be assessed by [CONTACT_8662]: 
Definitely Related: Clear-cut temporal association and no other possible cause. 
Probably Related: Clear-cut temporal associati on and a potential alternative 
etiolo gy is not apparent. 
 
Protocol # C-[ZIP_CODE] Version 3.0 
Revision Date: 9 July, 2020  Page 75 of 96 Possibly Related: Temporal association is less clear and other etiologies are 
also possible. 
Not Related: There is no temporal associati on and/or evidence exists that 
the event is definitel y related to another etiolo gy 
All adverse event reports are filed as required by [CONTACT_303432]. For 
all adverse events (whether device-related or  not), all sections of the appropriate 
Adverse Event Form(s) must be completed. In this study, all adverse events are collected starting after info rmed consent has been signed. 
 
AEs that may result from the DMR S ystem include those commonly associated 
with gastrointestinal endoscopy procedur es, as well as device-related AEs: 
potential acute and chronic adverse c onsequences of the device-induced 
duodenal ablation treatment, or  those resulting from dev ice malfunction, device 
user error, selected materials, device des ign or device construction.  Some AEs 
may be associated with both the procedure and the device. In addition, device 
malfunctions may occur which may or ma y not result in a device-related AE.

Revision Date: 9 July, 2020  Page 77 of 96  Component degradation  
 Device breakage  
 Device disarticulation  
 Any procedural or device-related adverse events are to be follow ed until there is 
evidence of resolution or permanent change.  The determination of whether an adverse event is classified as a SAE or UADE 
is based on the definitions contained in  sections 7.8.2 and 7.8.3, taking into 
account the clinical judgm ent of the investigator. 
 
 Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) 
A SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that:  
 Results in death,  
 Is immediately life-threatening,  
 Results in disability or permanent damage, 
 Requires intervention to prev ent permanent impai rment or damage, 
 Requires participant hospi[INVESTIGATOR_303343],  
 Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or 
 Is any other serious or  important medical event 
 Important medical events t hat may not result in deat h, be life-threatening, or 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_303344], based upon appropriate 
medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prev ent one of the outcomes listed in this 
definition.  This definition includes device deficiencie s that might have led to a SAE if a) 
suitable action had not been taken or b) in tervention had not been made or c) if 
circumstances had been less fortunate. These are handled under the SAE reporting system.  Planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a pre-existing condition, or  a procedure required by 
[CONTACT_760], without serious deterioration in health, is not considered a SAE.   A SAE may or may not be considered related to the device. 
 
 Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect (UADE) 
An UADE is defined as any serious adverse effect on health or safety or any life 
threatening problem or death caused by, or  associated with, the device if that 
effect, problem or death was not previous ly identified in nature, severity or 
degree of incidence in the in vestigational plan; or any other unanticipated serious 
problem associated with the device that rela tes to the rights, sa fety or welfare of 
subjects.   
 
Protocol # C-[ZIP_CODE] Version 3.0 
Revision Date: [ADDRESS_370477] are characterized as: 
 Specific events that may be related to the mechanism of action of the 
DMR procedure (eg,  hypoglycemia)  
 Potential adverse consequences of the procedure (eg, GI adverse events)  
 Rare events that may or may not be related to the DM R procedure/device, 
but are of interest to the S ponsor (eg, unexplained fever) 
 Irrespective of whether an AE is serious or non-serious, the following events are 
defined as ‘protocol-specified adverse events of special interest’ and have additional reporting requirements.  Events of Special Interest are: 
 Hypoglycemia 
 Diarrhea 
 Abdominal pain 
 Nausea 
 Vomiting 
 Gastrointestinal bleeding 
 Unexplained fever 
 As stated in Section 6.11.2, hypogl ycemia, unless the hypoglycemia epi[INVESTIGATOR_303345], will not be recorded as an adverse event, but will be 
captured on the Hypoglycemia Reporting eCRF  page. However, the Investigator 
is not prohibited from characterizing hypoglycemia as an AE. Any event of 
hypoglycemia reported as an AE will be cr oss-checked to ensure that the event 
is also reported on the Hypogl ycemia Reporting eCRF page.   
 Prior to starting Liraglutide rescue t herapy, a careful GI history should be 
obtained and the presence of nausea, vomi ting or diarrhea be recorded prior to 
the initiation of liraglutide treatment. Fo r epi[INVESTIGATOR_119999],  time from the DMR 
(or Sham) procedure, as well as dur ation of epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], will be recorded. 
Characteristics of diarrhea (bloody, steatorrhea), and other clinical symptoms 
associated with diarrhea (eg, fever, abdominal pain) will also be recorded.  
 All epi[INVESTIGATOR_151949], or naus ea, or vomiting will be reported as 
separate AEs.  If a subject experienc es combined symptoms of pain, nausea and 
vomiting, each will be reported as a separate AE unless a clear medical 
diagnosis is determined, eg, viral gastr oenteritis, and time from the DMR (or 
Sham) procedure, as well as durati on of epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], will be recorded. The 
Investigator needs to assess the clinical  state of the subject to ensure that 
potential obstruction or stenosis/stricture of the GI tract is not present. Three 
SAEs of duodenal stricture were reported ear ly in the DMR clinical program, but 
there have been no occurrences after proce dural and device  modifications were 
implemented. Nevertheless, if symptom s persist (e.g. two weeks for mild 
symptoms, three days for moderat e symptoms and 48 hours for severe 
 
Protocol # C-[ZIP_CODE] Version 3.0 
Revision Date: 9 July, 2020  Page 79 of 96 symptoms) or progress, an endoscopic ev aluation is recommended but left to the 
discretion of the investigator.  For any epi[INVESTIGATOR_303346], time from the DMR (or Sham) 
procedure, as well as duration of epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865] , will be recorded. All epi[INVESTIGATOR_303347]. Additional laborator y tests or diagnostic tests 
should be done according to medical judgm ent depending on the clinical course. 
 If a subject experiences a fever (> 38 ° C) that occurs within 2 weeks of the 
DMR/Sham procedure, and persists for several days, efforts should be made to 
identify a cause for the fever, if possible.  All additional symptoms associated with 
the fever (eg, rigors, abdominal pai n, diarrhea) should be recorded.  
 
 SAE & UADE Reporting 
AEs observed during the course of this tria l, regardless of severity or relationship 
to the trial procedure or investigational  medical device will be recorded on the 
appropriate Adverse Event Form  and reported to the Sponsor. 
 For US sites and reporting to FDA, the procedures for handling and 
reporting/notification of SAEs shall be carried out in accordance with the 
applicable sections of [ADDRESS_370478] reports should 
also be submitted by [CONTACT_39710]/fax to the Sponsor.    An Investigator shall submit to the S ponsor and to the reviewing IRB a report of 
any UADE occurring during an investigation as soon as possible, but in no event 
later than [ADDRESS_370479] an evaluation of a 
UADE, and report the results of such ev aluation to FDA and to all reviewing 
IRB’s and participating investigators with in [ADDRESS_370480] as FDA requests.

Revision Date: 9 July, 2020  Page 80 of 96  
All possibly and probably device and pr ocedure related AEs (including 
SAEs/UADEs/AESIs) reported during 24 weeks follow up will be followed until 
resolution. This will also also include resolution of all AEs (signs and symptoms) 
reported upto 24 weeks for which there is  not yet a definitive diagnosis and/or 
attribution of cause by [CONTACT_941] 24 weeks follow up visit.   
7.9 Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) 
A DMC will be convened for the study and assembled prior to subject enrollment. The group will be multidisciplinary and me mbership will include individuals not 
participating in the clinical study. The DMC members will ac t independently from 
both the Sponsor and the study investi gators. The group will consist of an 
endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_541], endocrinologist and a biostatist ician. Full DMC details including 
structure, roles and responsibilities are included in the DMC Charter. 
 General responsibilitie s of the DMC include: 
 Review and finalization of the DMC Charter 
 Review of data during the trial r egarding safety and regarding quality of 
trial conduct, including participant ri sk versus benefit, and other factors 
potentially affecting patient safety 
 Monitoring of the quality of the treatm ent provided at individual sites by 
[CONTACT_303433]- procedural complications and major 
protocol violations 
 Providing recommendations to the Sponsor about modifications in the 
protocol and/or continuati on of the trial necessary to maintain the safety of 
the subjects 
 To maintain continuous blinding and study integrity, the safety analysis will be 
conducted by [CONTACT_55467], and measures will be taken to ensure 
the validity of the data and integrity of the study’s c onduct. As part of the DMC 
Charter, the DMC will agree upon a set of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_17781], consistent 
with principles outlined in Section 7.9.1.  A fundamental responsib ility of a DMC is 
to make recommendations to the Sponsor concerning the continuation of the study: whether to continue the study as  designed; other recommendations that 
might be made include study termination, study continuation with major or minor 
modifications, or tempor ary suspension of enrollment  and/or study intervention 
until some uncertainty is resolved. T he DMC will document its recommendations, 
and the rationale for such recommendations, in a form that can be reviewed by 
[CONTACT_303434], if and as appropriate, to IRBs, FDA, and/or 
other interested parties. In almost all ca ses, a DMC is advisory to the Sponsor; 
the Sponsor decides whether to accept recommendations to discontinue a trial.  
 
 Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_303348] # C-[ZIP_CODE] Version 3.0 
Revision Date: 9 July, 2020  Page 81 of 96 The DMC may recommend termination or sus pension of the study if any of the 
following predefined conditions are met: 
 The DMC may terminate or suspend the study if an SAE resulting in death is 
possibly, probably, or definitely relat ed to the investigational device and/or 
procedure 
 The DMC may recommend termination of the study if an SAE that is probably 
or definitely related to the investig ational device or the investigational 
procedure occurs at a true rate as determined by [CONTACT_54446] 95% confidence 
bound of SAEs resulting in serious in jury, permanent impairment of a body 
function or permanent damage to a body st ructure that is greater than 1% 
 In addition, termination or suspens ion may be recommended for any other 
perceived safety concern based on clinic al judgment, including but not limited 
to a higher than anticipated rate for device failures resulting in adverse events, or unexpected SAEs 
 Treatment of the subjec ts will be paused if 6 subjects require escalation of 
their baseline antidiabetic medications  or addition of another antidiabetic 
medication at any time following DMR tr eatment or sham procedure, while the 
DMC evaluates the data to consider w hether treatments s hould continue   
 
7.10 Clinical Events Commi ttee (Adjudication Committee) 
A clinical events committee (CEC) will be es tablished to review important safety 
adverse events reported by [CONTACT_303435]-spec ified criteria.  
 The CEC will be composed of members co vering necessary medical specialties 
(eg, gastroenterology, endocrinology) and dev ice clinical trial experts. CEC 
members must disclose any potential conflicts of interest and must be 
independent of the Sponsor. 
 Information reviewed on each death, SAE, UA DE, or AE of Special Interest may 
include laboratory, pathology and/or imaging data, autopsy reports, physical 
descriptions, and any other  data deemed relevant. The CEC will be masked to 
the assigned study arm when performing th eir assessments. The importance of 
the CEC is in assessing Investigator at tribution of causality to the randomized 
treatment (DMR or Sham) in instances when severity or causality assessments 
may be deemed subjective and/or require the application of a comp lex definition.  
 In their assessments, the CEC will be gui ded by [CONTACT_303436][INVESTIGATOR_303349] 7.8.1 as potential adverse ev ents associated with sedation, endoscopy 
or the DMR  procedure, or device-rela ted adverse events associated with the 
DMR catheter and console, including devic e-related adverse events from the 
materials selected, device design or cons truction.  While the CEC will use their 
judgment in adjudicating causality,  general guidelines can be stated: 
 
 
Protocol # C-[ZIP_CODE] Version 3.0 
Revision Date: 9 July, 2020  Page 82 of 96  If the adverse event is associated with sedation, it should be ascribed to 
the procedure 
 If the adverse event is one t hat has been described with endoscopic 
procedures, it should be ascribed to  both the device and the procedure  
 If the adverse event is one that is rarely, if at all, associated with non-
invasive endoscopic procedures, it should be ascribed to the device 
 If the adverse event is one that has been identified in the protocol as a 
potential device-related adverse event, it should be ascribed to the device 
 The relationship of an adverse event to the device and to the procedure is to be  
assessed by [CONTACT_303437] 7.8.1, Study 
Procedure and Device Relationship. The CEC will review each causality assessment to ensure that the causality meets these protocol-specified criteria. 
 Only events that have been adjudicated will be used in the DMC safety 
assessments to guide the DMC decision r egarding study cont inuation. The CEC 
will work in accordance with written gui delines included in the CEC Charter 
describing in details the composition, ta sks, responsibilities and work processes 
of the Committee.  
The CEC will not share responsibility  with DMC for evaluating interim 
comparisons; however, their assessment s (performed at frequent intervals 
throughout the trial with results incor porated into the database in a timely 
manner) will help to ensure that  the data reviewed by [CONTACT_303438].   
[ADDRESS_370481] atistical Considerations 
 
8.1     Data Collection and Quality Control 
          8.1.1 Site Training 
The training of investigational si te personnel on proper data collection, 
documentation practices, and eCRF completion is the responsibility of Fractyl. To 
ensure uniform data collecti on and protocol compliance, Fractyl-appointed 
clinical monitors will review the clinical protocol, techniques for the identification 
of eligible subjects, and instructions on in -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/office visit data collection with 
the study site research coordinators.  This will be completed before or in 
conjunction with site initiation. 
 
           8.1.[ADDRESS_370482] ronic Case Report Forms (eCRFs) 
Subject data are recorded in a limited access secure electronic data capture 
(EDC) system. All changes made to the clinical data will be captured in an

previously submitted to the Sponsor r equire a new electronic signature [CONTACT_3265] [CONTACT_303440]. 
 
eCRFs must be completed fully for each subject by [CONTACT_7893], e-signed by [CONTACT_737], and available for review by [CONTACT_12721],  Fractyl and/or its 
designees.  
           8.1.3 Data Reporting 
The investigator, or an individual desig nated by [CONTACT_12552]/her, is responsible for 
recording all study data on the eCRFs s upplied by [CONTACT_303441]. The required study 
data will also be documented in t he subject’s medical record.  
 All patient related medical data in the study will be handled confidentially and as 
per applicable data protection laws and lo cal regulations and will not be released 
without the written consent of the subject (or the s ubject’s guardian). The data 
will be handled and stored in an anonymous format.  
 
          8. 1.[ADDRESS_370484] medical records by [CONTACT_303441]-appointed monitors and authorized gove rnment agencies, as indicated.    
 The study will be monitored according to applicable provisions of Fractyl or 
designee’s Monitoring Procedures, and in conformance with Good Clinical 
Practices. Study monitors must be  qualified by [CONTACT_3903]. 
 Monitoring will include pr e-study site qualification, site initiation visit, on-going site 
study monitoring and study closure monitoring as described in the study monitoring plan. The major function of t he clinical monitor is to observe and 
assess the quality of the clinical study. In  addition, the study will be monitored to 
ensure that potential adverse trends ar e quickly identified allowing immediate 
corrective action. The monito r’s duties will include: on-site  visits, observation of 
treatment with the study dev ices and review of study documents and results.   
 The study monitor will review/verify IRB approvals, Informed Consent documents, source documents and eCRFs. Visual and/or electronic data review 
will be performed by [CONTACT_303442].  
The study monitor(s) will verify the data entered into the eCRFs against hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2553], medical history, or other source documents to ensure accuracy and

attempted treatment with DMR) will be presented at each follow-up visit. 
 Distributions of each continuous variable will be assessed prio r to analysis and 
examined for normality. Data with interval or ratio scales to be analyzed that are not normally distributed will be analyz ed using non-parametric statistics. 
Statistical tests will be performed using two-sided significance levels of 5% 
unless otherwise specified.  The primary analysis phase is the first 24 weeks of the randomized treatment 
phase. Descriptive statistics on variables collected during the Medication Run-In 
phase will also be presented for completeness. 
 
           8.2.2 De termination of Sample Size 
Up to 6 study sites will randomize a maximum of 9 subjects in a 2:1 randomization scheme (DMR:Sham). Sample  size determination is based on the 
nature of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_303350]. The study is not

Protocol # C-[ZIP_CODE] Version 3.0 
Revision Date: 9 July, 2020  Page 85 of 96 Study Population:  The study population includes al l subjects consented at the 
site. Within this population there are Screened, Medication Run In, Intent-to-
Treat, As-Treated and Safety populations.  Intent-to-Treat (ITT):  The ITT population includes all subjects who were 
randomized after the Medication Run-In phase. This is the secondary analysis 
population for efficacy (no imputation wi ll be made for missing data, given the 
nature of the study; i.e., analysis on this  population will be performed using only 
available data). Subjects will be analyzed under  the treatment to which they were 
randomized. 
 
As-Treated (AT):  The subset of ITT subjects who received at least one ablation 
or undergo the randomized sham  procedure. This is t he primary population for 
efficacy.  No imputation will be made for missing data. Subjects will be analyzed 
under the treatment received.  
 
Week 24 Per Protocol Population: The PP population includes all subjects in 
the AT population who did not have any ma jor protocol deviations that could 
affect the assessment of efficacy and had their Week 24 study visit within the 
protocol-specified window. Subjec ts will be analyzed under the treatment 
received.    Safety:  This population includes all subjects in whom sham or DMR was 
attempted. Subjects will be analyzed a ccording to the treatment received. 
 
           8.2.4Demogra phic and Baseline Characteristics  
Demographic and baseline data will be summa rized using summary statistics of 
sample size, mean, standard deviation,  median, quartiles,  min and max for 
continuous variables and proportions and frequency of patients for categorical 
values. Demographics will be presented for the following analysis populations: 
3. The Medication Run-In 4. ITT overall and by-r andomized treatment group 
5. AT overall and by-a ctual treatment group  
 
           8.2.5 Safety Analysis 
All safety data will be displayed and analysed using descriptive statistical methods. No formal inferential analysis is planned for safety comparisons. The 
primary safety endpoint is proportion of  subjects experiencing device or 
procedure related SAEs or UADEs thr ough 24 Weeks following start of DMR or 
sham treatment. These will be presented overall and by [CONTACT_39812] (PT). This will be conducted on the Safety analysis set overall and 
by [CONTACT_266142]. Subjects who experience more than one event in a 
given System Organ Class (SOC) and PT will be counted once within that SOC 
 
Protocol # C-[ZIP_CODE] Version 3.0 
Revision Date: 9 July, 2020  Page 86 of 96 and PT. The total number of events and t he number and percentage of subjects 
with each event will be reported.  
 The remaining safety analyses discussed below will be carried out for the following sets within the Safety analysis population:  
1. Safety population through [ADDRESS_370487]-randomization, by [CONTACT_303443]  (DMR or sham, depending on the 
treatment the patient actua lly received) and overall. 
2. Safety population through [ADDRESS_370488]-DMR combined populations; 
this will include the first [ADDRESS_370489] crossover for 
patients switching from sham-t o-DMR. Results will be presented 
separately for patients originally rece iving DMR, for patients originally 
receiving Sham and receiving DMR at  week 24, and for all patients 
combined receiving DMR at start of the study or at Week 24. 
 
Clinical Laboratory Te sts and Vital Signs: Descriptive statistics (sample size, 
mean, standard deviation, median, quartiles, minimum and maximum) of 
observed measurement at each visit and of  the change from baseline (baseline is 
defined as the last measur ement prior to DMR procedu re) to each visit will be 
presented for each vital sign and laboratory variable. Listings of abnormal and/or 
clinically significant findings/values will be presented for each laboratory and vital 
sign variable.  
Duodenal biopsy sample assessment of  histological evidence of mucosal 
regrowth, inflammation and fibrosis will be summarized descriptively. Occurrence 
of  severe fibrosis or inflamma tion from ablated area duodenal biopsy will be 
compared to non-ablated control sample. 
 Adverse Events: AEs, SAEs and UADEs will be coded using MedDRA.  Treatment Emergent AEs, SAEs  and UADEs are defined as events starting or 
worsening after start of DMR (or sham, if  applicable). The number and percent of 
patients with Treatment Emergent AEs, SAEs and UADEs will be summarized 
overall and by [CONTACT_303444] C and preferred term (PT). Subjects who experience 
more than one event in a given SOC and PT will be counted once within that 
SOC and PT. Detailed listings of subjects  that experience AEs and SAEs will be 
provided.   The number and percent of subjects wit h treatment emergent AEs, UADEs and 
SAEs will be further presented by [CONTACT_303445]. In tabulating the severity of AEs on a per subject basis, the greatest 
severity will be assigned to a subject should there be more than one occurrence of the same AE with different reported se verities. Relationship will be categorized 
as unrelated, possibly, probably and defin itely related. The highest level of

Revision Date: [ADDRESS_370490] time of event, blood glucose 
value, symptoms if present, treatment, and duration. The incidence and event 
rates of hypoglycemia will be assessed based on the severity of the 
hypoglycemia: severe hypoglycemic event, defined as hypoglycemia requiring third-party assistance; or any clinically  significant hypoglycemic event, defined as 
self-monitored or laboratory plasma gluc ose level < 54 mg/dL (3.0 mmol/L); or  
glucose alert values ≤70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L). 
 Epi[INVESTIGATOR_303351], and as incidence.   
 
           8. 2.6 Effectiveness Analysis 
 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint:   
The primary efficacy endpoint is change in A1c at 24 Weeks. The analyses will 
be carried out on the AT analysis popul ation (primary) ,the ITT analysis 
population, and the Week 24 PP (per-protoco l) population. Descriptive statistics 
(mean, standard deviation, median, quart iles, minimum and maximum, and two-
sided 95% confidence interval of the m ean) of change in A1c will be presented 
by [CONTACT_21964] (DMR vs. sham) for the ITT population and by 
[CONTACT_303446]. 
Significance testing and 
statistical modeling will be omitted due to the small sample size.   
 
Secondary Efficacy Endpoints:  
(i) A1c change from baseline to Week 24 by [CONTACT_78789], DMR vs. Sham 
(ii) Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) ch ange from baseline to Week 24, DMR vs. 
Sham 
(iii) FPG change from baseline to Week 24 by [CONTACT_78789], DMR vs. Sham 
(iv) Urine Albumin Creatin ine Ratio (UACR) change from baseline to Week 24, 
DMR vs. Sham 
(v) Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) and Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) 
change from baseline to Week 24, DMR vs. Sham  
 
The above secondary endpoints will be analyzed on the same analysis 
populations and the same manner as  the primary efficacy endpoint.  
 
 Additional Endpoints of Interest: 
The following are the additio nal endpoints of interest. They will be analyzed for 
(a) the ITT, AT, and PP subjects randomized  to receiving DMR;  (b) for the ITT, 
AT, and PP subjects switching from Sham  to DMR at Week 24; and for (c) ITT, 
AT, amd PP subjects in (a) and (b) combined. Baseline is defined as the last 
measurement taken prior to the DMR procedure. 
 
(i) A1c change from Week 24 (pre-DMR) in S ham cross-over group to Week 48   
 
Protocol # C-[ZIP_CODE] Version 3.0 
Revision Date: 9 July, 2020  Page 88 of 96 (ii) FPG change from Week 24 (pre-DMR ) in Sham cross-over group to Week 
48   
(iii) Short Form (36) Health Survey Version 2 (SF-36) change from baseline at 
Week 24 (pre- assessments and endoscopy) vs Sham 
(iv) Patient-Reported Outcomes Meas urement Information System ( PROMIS®) 
change from baseline at Week 24 (pre- assessments and endoscopy) vs 
Sham 
 
For each endpoint, descriptive statisti cs (mean, standard deviation, median, 
quartiles, minimum and maximum, and two-si ded 95% confidence interval of the 
mean) will be presented.  
 
         8.2.[ADDRESS_370491] cohort is expected to occur at a low rate. All 
efforts will be made to prevent the occurrenc e of missing data. Site training and 
regular monitoring will help to minimize missing data. Due to the sample size and 
nature of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], there will be no imputation of missing data. In other 
words, analyses will be bas ed only on available data. 
 In the clinical study report, the number and proportion of ITT subjects who were 
in compliance through Week 24 at each follow-up visit will be presented. The 
number and percent of ITT subjects who prematurely withdraw from the study will 
be tabulated overall and by [CONTACT_167929] r withdrawal. This will be performed by 
[CONTACT_303447]. 
   
           8.2.8 An alyses on Medication Run In Phase 
The number and percent of patients wit h adverse events occurring during the 
Run-In phase will be presented overall and by [CONTACT_3592]. Descriptive statistics 
of end-of-run-in-phase A1c for all Medicati on Run-In subjects will be presented.

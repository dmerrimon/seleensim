 STUDY O BJECTIVES  
Our goals were  to better understand alcohol -related outcomes among HIV -positive persons over 
the lifespan and to implement a multisite comparative effectiveness trial (CET) in real- world 
clinical settings with three intensities of treatment to test their relative effectiveness in improving 
ART -adherence and alcohol -related outcomes among HIV -positive individuals who drink 
alcohol at harmful or hazardous levels. We aimed to  achieve the following four Specific Aims:  
Aim 1: Adapt the PLUS intervention for delivery in HIV cl inic settings by [CONTACT_169140], and incorporate booster sessions designed to sustain longer -term effects.  We 
aimed to  conduct formative research, and utilize our findings as well as capi[INVESTIGATOR_169121] ( e.g., text messaging)  to adapt PLUS for delivery in 
clinic settings as well as to develop booster sessions.  
Aim 2: Test the effectiveness of the PLUS intervention delivered in a consortium of HIV 
clinics in [LOCATION_001] City using a multisite CET with three in tensities of treatment.  Our 
primary goal wa s to test the PLUS intervention —an efficacious, theory -based intervention that 
integrates MI and CBST —versus an eTAU condition and TAU alone in reducing alcohol use and 
improving ART adherence, viral, and immunolo gic outcomes among HIV+ hazardous drinkers.  
Aim 3: Assess the cost -effectiveness of PLUS . If effective, we aimed to  conduct analyses to 
assess the cost -effectiveness of PLUS in treating HIV+ hazardous drinkers compared to eTAU  
and TAU alone as estimated over 5 - and 10- year windows. 
Aim 4: Collect and analyze retrospective cohort data and prospective natural history data, via Electronic Medical Records (EMR) at the SCCH  clinics.  We aimed to  conduct 
retrospective cohort analyses to compare virologic, immunologic, medical outcomes, and 
adherence to medical appointments/engagement in care between those who do (n = 1505) and do 
not (n = 3692) meet diagnostic criteria for alcohol abuse/dependence. We aimed to  use the third 
SCCH  clinic  (which will not receive any intervention) as a natural history comparison group, and 
conduct prospective analyses of data to better understand the natural history of the intersection 
between problematic alcohol use and HIV medication adherence and HIV hea lth outcomes. Of 
particular focus were  analyses of potential differences by [CONTACT_654], race/ethnicity, gender, sexual 
identity, viral hepatitis co -infection, years living with HIV, and years on ART. 
  
[ADDRESS_197482] a No -Treatment control 
group. Four sites were distributed across three study conditions in a quasi -experimental design. 
Two sites (Sites 1 and 2) implemented immediate treatment (Condition 1). Immediately after 
baseline, participants were offered the PLUS intervention. Participants then completed follow -up 
assessments at 3, 6, 9, 12, [ADDRESS_197483] 
condition (Condition 2) from March 26, [ADDRESS_197484] condition received the intervention following completion of their 12 -
month follow -up. Site 4 is the no- Treatment Control EMR Group. 
METHODS: Participants, Interventions and outcomes  
Inclusion Criteria  
• 18 years of age or older  
• HIV-positive  
• Currently receiving ART  
• Current VL ˃200 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/ml  
• Report drinking at hazardous levels, operationalized as exceeding [ADDRESS_197485] 3 months. 
• Must be a current patient at the clinic  with current lab results  
Exclusion Criteria  
• Effectiveness trials should enroll participants that reflect the population for which the treatment is intended. Thus, we are keepi[INVESTIGATOR_169122] a minimum and 
imposing few eligibility criteria to identify our target clinical population.  
• Given that the PLUS manual with guided step -by-step instructions, questions, and probes, 
as well as various modules and hand- outs for participants are all in English, study 
candidates will need to be able t o communicate effectively in English.  
7 
 • Any thought disorder ( e.g., psychosis , schizophrenia, bipolar, having severe symptoms of 
psychological disorder ) that would i mpair the indi vidual’s a bility to pro vide informed 
consent  or interfere with the study  proced ure.    
*** NOTE: Co -morbidities such as mental health problems, i.e., depression and anxiety 
disorder , and drug use  are NOT considered exclusion criteria. Additionally, current or 
previous participation in behavioral or neurocognitive studies or intervent ions is NOT 
considered an exclusion criterion.  
• Intoxicat ion or under the influence of alcohol or other substances at the time of consent 
that would impair the indi vidual’s a bility to pro vide in formed consent  or inter fere with 
the study procedure.  
 
INTERVENTION P ROCEDURES  
The six -session intervention is based on the PLUS (Positive Living through Understanding and 
Support) Clinical Protocol Manual. PLUS is an efficacious, theory -based intervention that 
utilizes motivational interviewing and cognitive behavioral skills training to reduce alcohol use 
and improve medication adherence. The participants were  informed that the sessions wou ld 
focus on alcohol use, other drug use and medication adherence. Sessions were delivered by a study therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541] (psychologists, social workers and psychiatrists) employed at the clinics.     
Six Sessions of PLUS  
Session 1: Guidance on Participant  Engagement in MI  
In Session 1, the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_169123] ’s perception of their 
behaviors  (drinking, substance use and medication adherence)  and what types of changes they 
would like to make. During these first sessions, the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_169124] a target behavior and 
offer s them feedback  from the assessment instruments they completed at baseline. In an MI -
consistent style, the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_169125] ’s read iness for change, and may move towards the 
planning phase collaborating on a change plan.  
Session 2: Overview of Functional Analysis Session  
The second session began  with re -engagement briefly summarizing the last session’s major 
themes on alcohol, substance use and adherence, highlighting any goals or plans that were 
discussed. The therapi[INVESTIGATOR_169126]  – drinking, 
8 
 using drugs, and missing doses of HIV medication in order to gain a comprehensive 
understanding of the common contexts of the  participant ’s risk behaviors.  Although in this 
session the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_169127] , the goal wa s to continue to communicate 
with the participant  in an MI consistent fashion, using “OARS” (Open Questions, Affirmations, 
Reflections and Summaries) reflective listening skills. As these patterns become more clear, the 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_169128] s them into a func tional analysis, which summarizes the chain (or sequence) of 
events, behaviors, and consequences typi[INVESTIGATOR_169129]. The therapi[INVESTIGATOR_169130] a case conceptualization. Next step involves 
orienting the participant  to the idea that chains can be disrupted. The creation of this functional 
analysis provides a starting point for discussing the rationale for CBT intervention and also for 
planning the specific CBST skills that a particular partic ipant  might focus on.  
Session s 3-5: Overview of Session Protocol for CBST Sessions  
Each of the three CBST sessions follows a similar protocol, although a different module/s may 
be covered in each session. Although modules are general guidelines for delivering skills, 
content covered with the participant  should be specific to the participant ’s needs. T he therapi[INVESTIGATOR_169131] t ry to complete at least two modules for each target behavior (substance use / medicatio n 
adherence). More than one module may be presented to the participant  during a single session, 
but it is important that the participant  doesn’t become overwhelmed by [CONTACT_3031]. With 
permission, teach copi[INVESTIGATOR_25110], conduct in -session exercise, and assign practice exercise.  
Session 6: Overview of Relapse Prevention Protocol  
Initial step of this session is to briefly review the goals previously identified  in the change plan. 
This summary should acknowledge ongoing discrepancy between current and desired status; however, it should also incorporate an emphasis on progress made  during treatment. If the 
participant  is in action or maintenance phase, the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_169132] ’s 
interest and willingness to discuss a relapse prevention plan. The therapi[INVESTIGATOR_169133] a 
high risk situation and what they would do should a slip or relapse occur.  
Booster Session : 
The purpose of the optional booster session wa s to ‘check in’ with the participant  on how they 
are doing with their drinking, substance use and HIV medication adherence, and remind them of 
when their next booster is (except for when this is t he final booster session). At  the end of the 
9 
 session, summarize the main points affirming any efforts the participant  has made to proceed 
towards their goals. Briefly recap any plans made during the session, including any plans to 
access referrals.  
Timeline  
The PLUS intervention was  adapted from an original eight session intervention to six sessions 
based on feedback from mental health staff at the sites . c. Research staff will keep track of 
participant’s attendance during PLUS intervention period via the tracking log. Booster sessions 
will also be scheduled and conducted but will not be required for treatment exposure to the 
PLUS intervention.  
Enrollment  in Immediate and Waitlist control conditions  
Potential participants in the immediate and waitlist control conditions were identified through a 
prescreening review of EMR , which provided study staff members with lists of patients with 
scheduled clinic visits who had one or more detectable viral load within the past year. Study staff approached these patients during clinic  visits to introduce PLUS and invited them to participate 
in screening. Participants provided verbal consent for screening and provided written informed consent if they were eligible and interested in enrolling. They also granted permission for the 
study t eam to abstract their EMR data for study screening and enrollment purposes.  
Once consent to use the EMR was granted, eligibility criteria were verified for ART regimen and 
viral load. Participant self -report was used to determine alcohol and substance use  criteria on the 
screening questionnaire. Eligible participants who enrolled in the study were scheduled for a 
baseline visit, which could take place the same day post -screening or be scheduled within the 
ensuing month. The full protocol was approved by [CONTACT_169141].  
Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_169134] (MI), Cognitive Behavioral Skills Training (CBST), and the PLUS Clinical Manual. MI and CBST trainings we re provided by [CONTACT_169142] (CHEST). After trainings, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_169135] -sessions with a mock participant. 
All MI mock sessions were coded via the Motivational Interviewing Treatment Integrity (MITI)  
system  and were reviewed for fidelity with CBST. Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_169136] 
10 
 and were asked to repeat sess ion based on feedback to reach competency in intervention as 
needed .  
Intervention Monitoring and Quality Control  
Standardized rating systems (MITI Coding with a CBST checklist) were  used to evaluate 
the competency of study therapi[INVESTIGATOR_169137] t he full trial. Once the trial beg an, we 
monitor ed the implementation and select 25% of taped sessions to assess fidelity to protocol.

 Compensation  
To compensate participants for their time and efforts in taking part in the PLUS trial, gift cards  
and metro cards were  given out at each assessment and therapy visit, respectively , in two 
different denominations for participant compensation:  
$25 Gift cards - which will be dispersed during study assessments (BL, 3M, 6M, 9M, 12M, 15M, 
and 18M)  
$10 Metro cards - which will be dispersed during therapy visits (Sessions 1- 6) 
Throughout the course of the PLUS trial, a study participant may receive $[ADDRESS_197487] control conditions. This matched cohort 
of patients received care at a fourth  clinic that did not receive any intervention (i.e., PLUS or 
eTAU) and was considered as a natural history comparison group. We generated a pool of 
patient records from which to randomly select the T AU matched cohort of patients ( n = 120). We 
included patient records of patients with an HIV diagnosis who had at least 1 primary care visit at the TAU clinic, received ART, and had a viral load (VL) >200 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL during the PLUS 
enrollment period from March 26, [ADDRESS_197488] the TAU cohort of 120 patients while matching as c losely as 
possible to patients enrolled in the trial on key variables: age group (with ranges 18 -29, 30- 39, 
40-49, and 50 or older) , racial  and ethnic identity (Black, Hispanic/Latinx, White, Asian/Pacific 
Island, Other/Multiracial) , and gender  (recorded a s male or female) . Additionally, we matched 
on indicators of substance misuse based on EMRs of trial participants using documentation of substance use problems or ICD -10 diagnostic codes, such as documentation of alcohol abuse or 
dependence, having had a s ubstance use diagnosis, or any indication of substance misuse during 
the study period. EMRs were then extracted for the TAU cohort of patients similar to the records 
12 
 for the trial participants. A de -identified dataset was generated linking all patient EMRs  to an 
unique study ID numbe r with the following variables: demographic variables, HIV diagnosis, 
HIV clinical outcomes, ARV regimen, ICD -10 diagnoses of AIDS defining illness, substance use 
disorders, psychiatric disorders, non- AIDS defining infections (bacterial pneumonia, cellulitis, 
sepsis), cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, liver, kidney, pulmonary, endocrine, immune, and 
oncologic diseases, as well as sexually transmitted infections. In addition, records about services 
received and type of outpatient clinic visits were extracted, such as whether the visit was an HIV 
primary care visit, a specialty or non- HIV primary care visit type (dentist, OB/GYN, 
hematology), mental health visit, and substance use visit. 
Data Analysis Plan  
To assess the effectivene ss of our randomization procedure, we used chi -square tests and 
ANOVAs to investigate the equivalence of possible cofounders across each of the PLUS -
enrolled four site/conditions at baseline. Specifically, we examined proportional differences 
across demogr aphic characteristics (race and ethnicity, sexual and gender identity, and 
education), and mean differences across age and baseline outcome values (alcohol severity, drug use severity, medication adherence, viral load, and CD4). Where cell sizes were too s mall ( n < 5) 
to permit chi- square tests, we utilized a Fisher’s exact test, at p <.05. The matching of the No 
Treatment control group ( N = 120) was assessed by [CONTACT_169143] -
enrolled sample ( N = 174) on the available variables of age, race and ethnicity, and gender.  
 We also conducted analyses to test for the presence of differential attrition between 
conditions and sites where appropriate. First, we conducted chi -square analyses to test for 
differential attrition by [CONTACT_169144] -up. We also tested for differential 
attrition at each follow -up across site, as well as several demographic characteristics (race and 
ethnicity, sexual and gender identity, and education). Finally, we  conducted a series of point -
biserial correlations to examine attrition at each wave by [CONTACT_169145] (alcohol severity, drug use severity, medication adherence, viral load, and CD4).  
Outcome analyses were conducted using pi[INVESTIGATOR_13959] -wise long itudinal growth curve models, 
adjusting for baseline scores on the corresponding outcome and, for the models predicting 
medication adherence, AUDIT, and DAST, we also adjusted for gender identity and sexual 
orientation, whereas for the models predicting vi ral load and CD4 we adjusted for gender (male, 
female) as sexual identity was not indicated in the EMR records for the matched cohort. For the 
[ADDRESS_197489] was treated as a count variable having a negative binomial distribution. The 
latent intercept re presented the initial 3 -month follow -up time point. Slope 1 quantified linear 
change across the 3 -, 6-, 9- and 12- month follow -ups. Where possible for outcomes variables 
extracted from EMR (i.e., CD4 count and viral load), Slope [ADDRESS_197490] of clinic and condition was entered as a 4-
category predictor that was dummy -coded. For viral load and CD4 models – where data were 
taken from EMR records – the EMR cohort control participants were included as an additional 
subgroup and served as the referent category.  
All models were estimated using full- information maximum likelihood estimation in 
MPlus Version 8.0. Good model fit was assumed when the χ2/df ratio was 3 or less, root -mean 
square error of approximation (RMSEA) ≤ 0.05, Tucker -Lewis fit index (TLI) > 0.95, and 
comparative fit index (CFI) > 0.95.  
Data Monitoring  
The study protocols are approved by [CONTACT_169146]’s academic institution  and Mt Sinai, and are registered with clinicaltrials.gov 
(NCT 02390908).

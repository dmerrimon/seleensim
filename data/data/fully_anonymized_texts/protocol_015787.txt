Protocol Date: February 4, [ADDRESS_728577], occurring in ≥ 25% of U.S. veterans, contributes substantially t o health care 
costs as it is the most common inpatient GI discharge diagnosis and the most common 
indication for upper endoscopy (upper endoscopy procedures increased 54% from 2000 
to 2009 in commercially insured patients).[ADDRESS_728578] common outpatient 
diagnosis for GI disorders with > 9 million visits annually.1 Thus, the VA spends >$177 
million yearly on outpatient PPI [INVESTIGATOR_554790]. Our local VA, the Tennessee Valley Health 
System (TVHS), has ~65,000 total patients and 19,094 (29.4%) of these patients are 
currently on PPIs. Furthermore, our TVHS endoscopy lab currently sees [ADDRESS_728579] and the rise of obesity in the U.S . population since the 1970’s.2,4,5,[ADDRESS_728580], 
obesity increases the number of acid reflux epi[INVESTIGATOR_554791] < 4.[ADDRESS_728581] symptoms (from 37 to 15% of subjects) with a 13% (of baseline 
body weight) weight loss after [ADDRESS_728582] 
alternative weight loss strategies are associated with a high degree of weight recidivism; 
a recent meta -analysis revealed that long -term weight maintenance at 4 -5 years after a 
structured we ight loss program averages about 23% of initial weight loss.[ADDRESS_728583] symptoms in 100% of subjects.                 
1.[ADDRESS_728584] Assessment: There is no one test for establishing a diagnosis of GERD 
either objectively or by [CONTACT_554818]. As initial management of GERD is 
provided with antisecretory drug s (PPIs and H2RAs), diagnostic testing for GERD is 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_554792]’s metaplasia. In these 
cases, endoscopy (with or without biopsy) is the first test used, typi[INVESTIGATOR_554793] -daily PPI.[ADDRESS_728585] normal findings with endoscopy, manometry is 
used to evaluate lower esophageal sphincter function as well as peristaltic functioning 
and motor disorders. Ambulatory pH monitoring is performed (while PPI [INVESTIGATOR_554794]) to determine the frequency, severity and duration of reflux epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]. While 
wireless pH monitoring appears to have greate r sensitivity than impedance, impedance 
monitoring allows evaluation of both acid and non -acid reflux events, and is conducted 
for a shorter period of time (24 vs 48 hours of monitoring). With impedance pH 
monitoring, a pH score (Johnson -DeMeester Score) i s calculated from 6 parameters: 
percent total time pH <4.0 , percent upright time pH <4.0, percent supi[INVESTIGATOR_554795] <4.0,

Protocol Date: February 4, 2016  March 2, 2016 February 13, 2019  number of reflux epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841], number of reflux epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841] ≥ 5min., and minutes of longest 
reflux epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865].[ADDRESS_728586] is a complex condition with many presentations, there are abou t 20 instruments 
currently used in clinical practice and/or research to evaluate GERD symptoms, typi[INVESTIGATOR_554796]. A recent 
systematic review showed that [ADDRESS_728587] Symptom Assess ment Scale 
(GSAS),[ADDRESS_728588] on life, and was based on results from a study that 
showed a positive correlation between the frequency of heartburn, regurgitation, sleep 
disturbances and use of over -the-counter medications f or reflux and esophageal pH < 
4.0. A randomized trial showed that the GERDQ can identify patients with a high 
likelihood of GERD who are in need of drug therapy as well as those who are in need of 
objective testing.19      
1.2 Diet: Although avoidance of alcohol, caffeine, chocolate, acidic foods, spi[INVESTIGATOR_84716], 
mint, and high fat foods are typi[INVESTIGATOR_554797], there remains 
a lack of suppor ting evidence.20-[ADDRESS_728589] symptoms within 2 weeks  of 
following the Atkins diet which limits carbohydrate (CHO) intake to 20g per day.24 As 
patients also restricted coffee,  caffeine and acidic fruit intakes, it is unclear whether 
reduced CHO intake was the primary factor responsible for symptom resolution. Another 
study utilizing a crossover design with 41 subjects, compared low fat to low CHO diet for 
3 months and  reported  that 68% of subjects had symptom improvement on low CHO 
diet.[ADDRESS_728590] to design bias as subjects were not randomized 
to treatment arm. Finally, a recent study evaluate d esophageal pH in 8 obese females 
six days after carbohydrate restriction of 20 g/day.26 In this study, percent time with pH 
<4.0 in the distal esophagus droppe d significantly from 5.1% to 2.5% ( p = 0.02) and 
there was significant decrease in Johnson -DeMeester score from 34.7 to 14.0 ( p = 0.02) 
– an effect similar to that expected with PPI [CONTACT_3148].27 Subjects also had significant 
improvement in symptom severity (GSAS score from 1.28 to 0.72, p = 0.0004). Notably, 
the published studies utilize a severe restriction of CHO at 20g/day which confounds 
applicability to the VA obese adult population who typi[INVESTIGATOR_554798] ~325g/day. 
Furthermore, our preliminary data suggest an effect not just of amount of CHO 
consumed, but type of CHO. With regard to type of CHO, it is intriguing that a study in 
healthy volunteers reported  increased number of transient LES relaxations, esophageal 
acid exposures, reflux epi[INVESTIGATOR_554799] (a 
simple sugar).28  
1.3 GI Hormones and Insulin: Other studies have investigated hormones as a potential 
explanation for diet -induced GERD symptoms, particularly in relation to gastric motility or 
LES pressure. Most often studied has been the hormone gastrin, whose release is 
stimulated from digested food in the stomach as well as in response to gastric pH, and in 
Protocol  Version  #: 3.0 3.1 3.3.  5 
Protocol Date: February 4, 2016  March 2, 2016 February 13, 2019  
turn, is a factor influencing LES pressure postprandially.29 Further, the orexigenic 
hormone ghrelin influences upper GI motility30 and treatment with ghrelin has improved 
gastric emptying in rodent models.31 Ghrelin also h as a role in regulation of glucose 
homeostasis via modulation of insulin secretion and sensitivity.32 Also influencing gastric 
emptying is the  anorexigenic ho rmone glucagon -like peptide -1 (GLP -1), which also 
influences postprandial plasma glucose, insulin and c -peptide levels.[ADDRESS_728591] symptoms as well as erosive esophagitis in normal weight adults.34           
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
1.4 Summary of the Problem: The VA spends >$[ADDRESS_728592] is $[ADDRESS_728593] in ≥ 40% of patients treated 
with PPIs. Unresolved GERD leads to significant comorbidities - it appear s ~25% of 
veterans age >[ADDRESS_728594] Barrett’s Esophagus,[ADDRESS_728595] and the rise of obesity in the U.S. population since the 1970’s, 
weight loss trials have not consistently demonstrated improvement  in GERD symptoms, 
medication use, or related outcomes - there remains insufficient evidence for dietary 
recommendations for veterans with GERD.  
Protocol  Version  #: 3.0 3.1 3.3.  6 
Protocol Date: February 4, 2016  March 2, 2016 February 13, 2019  1.5 Opportunity Presented Here:  This study will rigorously test a compelling 
hypothesis regarding GERD pathophy siology and will provide evidence from a 
randomized controlled trial in this at -risk population for whom there is little evidence -
based insight with regard to readily modifiable dietary risk factors. Dietary intervention 
has been demonstrated and is predic ted to have other salutary effects such as improved 
body weight, insulin sensitivity and lipid profiles.   
1.6 Innovation of Study: While it has long been thought that dietary factors play a role 
in promoting or exacerbating GERD symptoms, we are unaware o f any evidence that 
effects of dietary macronutrients have been rigorously tested. Indeed, a PubMed search 
only returned [ADDRESS_728596] in a veterans’ population. The very limited 
body of literature has targeted dietary fat and saturated fat i ntake. Yet, our preliminary 
data show a strong relationship between dietary simple carbohydrate (sugars) and 
GERD. In fact, our data show that obese subjects with GERD had complete resolution of 
their symptoms and medication use when following a low carboh ydrate diet in which 
simple carbohydrate intake was strictly controlled. Obese individuals with GERD have 
rarely been studied beyond investigation of an association between body mass and 
GERD symptoms or between dietary fat intake and GERD symptoms. Our pr oposal to 
investigate the role of dietary carbohydrate is unique and the robustness of the proposed 
experimental design is novel in the GERD literature. Indeed a PUBMED search of 
carbohydrate and gastroesophageal reflux returned only a single citation; “Im provement 
of gastroesophageal reflux disease after initiation of a low -carbohydrate diet: five brief 
case reports” Altern Ther Health Med. 2001 Nov -Dec;7(6):120, [ADDRESS_728597]: PPIs are one of the top [ADDRESS_728598] sellin g pharmaceuticals;  the VA spends 
>$[ADDRESS_728599] is $10 -20 billion annually. Yet, ≥ 40% of individuals on PPIs or 
H2RAs fail to respond.  Our local VA, the Tennessee Valley Health System ( TVHS), has 
19,[ADDRESS_728600] is a substantial 
source of morbidity, leading to esophagitis, strictures, Barrett’s esophagus and 
esophageal adenocarcinoma. The incidence of GERD and esophageal adenocarcinoma 
has increased >350% since the mid -1970’s, which parallels the increased prevalence of 
obesity during the past 3 -4 decades. In addition, obesity is associated with a 2.5 -fold 
increased risk of Barrett’s esophagus in veterans.37 The proposed dietary intervention, if 
deemed efficacious, can be directly implemented in dai ly clinical practice – without high 
costs or adverse side effects. It offers the potential to reduce symptom burden and 
medication use, and will provide evidence needed for future investigation of long -term 
sequellae of GERD. As 72% of the VA population is  now overweight or obese,7,[ADDRESS_728601] 25% currently have GERD, we will generate significant information  regarding a 
serious pathophysiology that not only fills a gap in the evidence base where only case 
reports exist, but will inform clinical practice and has potential to reduce health costs.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Protocol  Version  #: 3.0 3.1 3.3.  7 
Protocol Date: February 4, 2016  March 2, 2016 February 13, 2019  2.0 Rationale and Specific Aims  
General Approach: We will use a randomized controlled trial design to rigorously test 
the hypotheses that low total carbohydrate and/or low simple (low sugars) carbohydrate 
dietary intake will reduce/resolve GERD in obese veterans. From our preliminary data of 
144 obese adults, we foun d that total carbohydrate was comprised of ~ 50% complex 
CHO and ~50% simple CHO (sugars) - prior to dietary intervention. Thus, that 
composition forms the definition for our control diet (below).  
2.1 Rationale and Strategy:   
Background PPI [CONTACT_193691]:  Acid sup pression therapy is commonly prescribed, particularly in 
the VA for symptomatic GERD relief. Our research team, which includes practicing 
clinicians and experienced GERD researchers (Drs. Vaezi and Smalley) debated a 
design wherein we would require researc h subjects to discontinue all acid suppression 
therapy for the duration of the study. It is clear that based upon symptom burden and for 
the purposes of adherence to study procedure that this would not be feasible. Further, 
we were concerned that if acid r elated damage were occurring off of acid suppression, 
then such a design may not be ethical. Thus, we have adapted a much more “clinical” or 
“intention -to-treat” mindset to the study design.  Indeed, in a clinical setting, patients are 
most often treated e mpi[INVESTIGATOR_3675]. Thus, we will follow AGA guidelines9 and have subjects 
maintain acid suppression therapy during the intervention, with the exception of the [ADDRESS_728602] in our preliminary data was not acid 
dependent given that all subjects self -discontinued use of acid suppression medications.  
We will perform secondary analysis in which changes in PPI [INVESTIGATOR_554800]. We will use the dai ly medication (type and dose) and diet checklist data and 
24hr diet recall data to conduct secondary analyses and verify the assumptions of our 
primary model. Summary statistics by [CONTACT_554819], PPI [CONTACT_3225], total C HO, and simple CHO are consistent with the study design. We will 
also use the linear mixed effects model to determine if total and simple CHO are 
associated with total percent time pH < [ADDRESS_728603] (type, amount and dose) to create continuous 
variables of the weekly dose o f PPI. PPI [INVESTIGATOR_554801] a linear mixed 
effects regression model that includes time modeled flexibly using restricted and diet 
group indicators. An analogous model using weight as the outcome will be estimated.  
Choice of Objective Disease Mea sures:  As described above in section 1 .1, we will 
employ impedance pH monitoring to determine acid and non -acid reflux events over a 
24-hour period. This will allow data collection for our primary outcome, percent of time 
with pH < 4.0 , as well as the othe r 5 measures that comprise the Johnson -DeMeester 
score.15 For motility, we will use the the SmartPi[INVESTIGATOR_102903], which measures 
whole and regional gut tr ansit times. Kuo et al38and Sarosiek et al39 describe sensitivity 
and specificity for the SmartPi[INVESTIGATOR_4382]. SmartPi[INVESTIGATOR_554802] (GES). Correlation between SmartPi[INVESTIGATOR_554803] 0.73, the 
Protocol  Version  #: 3.0 3.1 3.3.  8 
Protocol Date: February 4, 2016  March 2, 2016 February 13, 2019  ROC curves between healthy subjects and gastroparetics was 0.83 for SmartPi[INVESTIGATOR_38847] 
0.82 for GES, and the sensitivity/specificity for diagnosing gastroparetics for SmartPi[INVESTIGATOR_554804] 0.65 / 0.87 and for GES was 0.44 / 0.93. In addition, Maqbool et al40 showed 
correlation between SmartPi[INVESTIGATOR_554805] 0.[ADDRESS_728604] 
could prompt the development of future more invasive studies to examine such effects.  
Choice of Subjective Disease Measures: As there are ~[ADDRESS_728605] both item and context validity (both are more fully discussed above in section A.1., 
and in the Measures section i below).     
Duration of Intervention: Implementing a dietary intervention can present some 
challe nges with regard to dietary compliance as well as subject retention for the duration 
of a study. Our preliminary data shows a significant effect of low carbohydrate diet after 
9 weeks of intervention – all subjects with GERD had resolution of their symptom s and 
GERD medication use. In the proposed study, we have chosen to continue to use a [ADDRESS_728606] internal validity of the study. Our aim is to 
minimize potential attrition, maximize statistical power, and minimiz e the time 
commitment while providing a dietary intervention of adequate duration to experience 
effects.  
Weight Loss: We recognize the benefits of weight loss in the obese veteran and are 
highly encouraged by [CONTACT_554820]! program. 
Interestingly, our preliminary data showed resolution of GERD symptoms and 
medication use, as well as improvement in insulin sensitivity – independent of weight 
loss. To clearly determine the effects of the modifying dietary carbohydrate intake per se 
and control for potential confounding (which would distort study findings) by [CONTACT_554821], subjects will be prescribed diets in which the 
energy content will maintain body weight, not induce weight loss. Body weight will be 
monitored by [CONTACT_554822]. Body composition will be assessed at end of study 
weeks 1 and 9 by [CONTACT_554823] (described in Measures section below). Upon 
completion, the study dietitian will counsel subjects about unhealthy weight and pro vide 
a written handout on caloric reduction for weight loss.  
 
 
Protocol  Version  #: 3.0 3.1 3.3.  9 
Protocol Date: February 4, 2016  March 2, 2016 February 13, 2019  2.2  Methods:  
Design: Randomized controlled dietary trial with 4 treatment arms comparing amount 
and type of CHO:  
 
• High total & high simple carbohydrate (HTHS):  50% complex CHO + 50% simple C HO (control diet)  
• High total & low simple carbohydrate (HTLS):  85% complex CHO + 15% simple CHO  
• Low total & high simple carbohydrate (LTHS):  50% complex CHO + 50% simple CHO  
• Low total & low simple carbohydrate (LTLS):  85% complex CHO + 15% simple CHO  
Diets: We have extensive  experience designing, prescribing and assessing diets.42,43 At 
baseline, dietary int ake will be assessed by [CONTACT_554824] (full methods described under Measures below). Energy content of 
daily intake will be estimated based on the individual’s daily energy requirement using 
the Harris Benedict Equation with an activity factor of 1.2.[ADDRESS_728607] is randomized. Meal plans will be developed by [CONTACT_42020]-Investigator (Silver) using NDS -R software (NDS -R version 2013, Nutrition 
Coordinating Center, Minn, MN) and instructed to subjects by [CONTACT_554825] 1 ( see Schema below). To manipulate the carbohydrate amount (high 
vs low), we will alter the fat content of the diet. There will be no difference among diets in 
protein content. To manipulate type of carbohydrate (complex vs simple), we will provide 
instructi ons, the written meal plan, and a comprehensive list of which carbohydrate foods 
the subject can/can’t consume.  
To clearly delineate, simple carbohydrates are defined as those carbohydrates classified 
as mono - or di -saccharides, meaning they have one (glu cose, galactose, fructose) or 
two (sucrose, lactose, maltose, trehalose) sugar units. Major sources of simple 
carbohydrates (or “sugars”) are: soft drinks, cakes, cookies, pi[INVESTIGATOR_014], fruit punch, sweet tea, 
candy, table sugar, and syrups. Complex carbohydrates are also known as “starches” 
and consist of the oligo - and poly -saccharides, meaning they have 3 or more sugar 
units. Major sources of complex carbohydrates (or “starches”) are: grains, cereals, 
legumes, corn, popcorn, pasta, rice, potatoes and vegetables.  We recognize that major 
sources of both simple and complex carbohydrates have components of both and we 
are able to quantify these within a food using the NDS -R software.   
All meal plans will provide 3 meals and 2 snacks per day that meet the macronutrien t 
composition and the diet treatment arm:  
 
• HTHS Diet: 55% total CHO (½ complex / ½ simple CHO), 30% fat, 15% protein  
• HTLS Diet: 55% total CHO (85% complex / 15% simple CHO), 30% fat, 15% protein  
• LTHS Diet: 35% total CHO (½ complex / ½ simple CHO), 50% fat , 15% protein  
• LTLS Diet: 35% total CHO (85% complex / 15% simple CHO), 50% fat, 15% protein  
 
 
 
Protocol  Version  #: 3.0 3.1 3.3.  10 
Protocol Date: February 4, 2016  March 2, 2016 February 13, 2019  Power Analysis and Sample Size:  Our primary outcome is a continuous variable, 
percent time pH < 4.[ADDRESS_728608] of 
pH < 4.0 for > 5.5% of the 24hr period. To determine sample size, we used data from 
[ADDRESS_728609]. Vaezi's clinic population. In this sample, 
the SD for percent time < pH was 9.8 and the interclass correlation was 0.39 (
 = 
2b / 
(
2b + 
2e)).  We used these values as inputs into a statistical simulation (10,000 
replications) to determine the probability of detecting any treatment group effect using 
the linear mixed effects model. The following table presents the power o f an overall (4 
d.f.) test to detect various absolute changes in pH by [CONTACT_554826] (
 1, 
 2, 
 3, 
 4).  We 
assume n 1=40 subjects per group complete the entire study and n 2=5 or n 2=3 subjects 
per group complete 80% of the study before returning for pH testing . We use a two -sided 
significance level of 0.05.   
Absolute effect size  3.7%, 3.7%, 3.7%, 3.7%  0%, 4.5%, 4.5%, 4.5%  0%, 4%, 4%, 4%  0%, 0%, 5%, 5%  0%, 0%, 0%, 7%  
Power (n 1=40, n 2=5) 0.80 0.89 0.80 0.85 0.87 
Power (n 1=40, n 2=3) 0.[ADDRESS_728610] size scenarios that give 80% -90% power are presented in the 
table.  If the absolute change in percent time pH < 4 for each of the four diet groups is 
3.7%, we will have 80% power to detect any effect of diet. If [ADDRESS_728611] a 4.5% effect, we have almost 90% power to detect a diet 
effect. In our pi[INVESTIGATOR_10299], the 25th/50th/75th percentiles of percent time pH < 4 were 
4.8%/8.5%/12.4%. Thus, a 3.7% decrease is a change from the median to 25th 
percentile, a 4% decrease is a change from the 75th percentile to the median, a 5% 
decrease is a change from the 80th percentile to the median, and a 7.6% decrease is a 
change from the 75th to the 25th percentile. The standard error for any pairwise 
compar ison between groups will be 1.9% under all scenarios (n 1=40 and n 2=3 or n 2=5). 
 
2.3  SPECIFIC AIMS :  
Gastro -esophageal reflux disease (GERD) occurs in 25 -30% of U.S. adults, including 
veterans,[ADDRESS_728612] common 
inpatient gastrointestinal (GI) disease discharge diagnosis and the most common 
outpatient diagnosis for GI disorders in the U.S. with > 9 million visits annually.1 The VA 
spends >$[ADDRESS_728613]. Higher body mass 
index (BMI) is associated with increased risk for GERD,4-[ADDRESS_728614] is likely related to the obesity epi[INVESTIGATOR_901].2 Indeed, 72% of veterans are 
overweig ht or obese.7,[ADDRESS_728615] is 3 -fold greater for obese men 
and 4 -fold greater for obese women (compared to normal weight adults). Thus, the 
American Gastroenterology Association guidelines advise weight loss for 
overweight/obese people with GERD.9  
It has long been thought that several dietary factors (acidic foods, spi[INVESTIGATOR_84716], mint, 
chocolate, caffeine and alcohol) as well as a high fat diet may precipi[INVESTIGATOR_554806]. In fact, most stu dies on dietary factors have targeted total and saturated fat 
intake as risk factors. However, most of the evidence comes from epi[INVESTIGATOR_554807] 
(esophagitis and adenocarcino ma). When data are adjusted for BMI the relationships 
between total or saturated fat intake and GERD are not significant. Furthermore, weight 
loss trials utilizing low fat diets have not consistently demonstrated improvement in 
GERD symptoms.10 
Protocol  Version  #: 3.0 3.1 3.3.  11 
Protocol Date: February 4, 2016  March 2, 2016 February 13, 2019  We recently conducted a nutrition intervention utilizing a low carbohydrate / high fat diet 
in 144 Caucasian and African American adults age 21 -50 years with Class I obes ity (BMI 
30.0-39.9). At baseline, 25% of subjects reported experiencing GERD symptoms 
(heartburn, reflux and/or indigestion) at least once a week. Over 1/3 used a proton pump 
inhibitor (PPI) or histamine [ADDRESS_728616] (H 2RA) at least once a week. A t 
baseline, we found that subjects with GERD had significantly higher total sugar intakes 
(101.6 ± 50.3 vs 82.5 ± 40.9 grams/day, p = 0.024), but not higher total fat intakes. 
Notably, total sugar intake was a strong predictor of having GERD symptoms ( p = 
0.007). Most unexpectedly, all GERD symptoms and medication use had resolved by 
[CONTACT_153803] 9 -week low carbohydrate / high fat diet intervention.  Moreover, 
reduced total sugar intake was significantly associated with improved insulin sensitivity 
(HOM A-IR score: r =0.37, p =0.001), independent of weight loss.  
Overarching Hypothesis : Our overarching hypothesis is that the type (not just the 
amount) of dietary carbohydrate intake contributes to GERD symptoms in obese 
persons.  
Specific Hypothesis:  Our pre liminary findings suggest a physiological mechanism 
between dietary intake and GERD that may be related to type of dietary carbohydrate 
intake (complex vs simple carbohydrate). We hypothesize that modifying the type of 
dietary carbohydrate consumed - by [CONTACT_554827] 
(sugars) consumed - will reduce or resolve GERD symptoms and medication use in 
obese veterans with chronic GERD. We further hypothesize that the mechanistic effects 
of reducing simple carbohydrate intake is rela ted to either: a) improved dietary fiber 
intake and/or glycemic load, and thus, reduced amount and duration of esophageal acid 
exposure; and/or b) improved insulin sensitivity which would positively influence the 
function of key gastrointestinal hormones ( ie, gastrin, glucagon, GLP -1, ghrelin11) that 
regulate gastric motility and/or lower esophageal sphincter function.             
Aim 1:  To determine effects of di etary carbohydrate consumed (amount and type) on 
percent time with esophageal pH < 4.0, as well as number of reflux epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841], GERD 
symptoms and GERD medication use, in [ADDRESS_728617] symptoms. To meet this aim we  will use a randomized controlled 
trial in which we manipulate amount of total and simple dietary carbohydrate intake for 
duration of 9 weeks.  
Aim 2:  To assess associations between GERD resolution variables and factors related 
to potential mechanisms by w hich modifying dietary carbohydrate intake could 
resolve/reduce GERD in obese veterans.  
2a: We will investigate associations related to whether the effect is nutritionally 
mediated by [CONTACT_554828], and 
thus, whether these changes are related to improved gastric acid secretion ( % time 
pH < 4) , gastric motility, and/or the other parameters that comprise the Johnson -
DeMeester score.  
2b: We will also investigate whether effects are associated with changes in the 
hormonal milieu by [CONTACT_554829], glucagon, GLP -1, 
ghrelin and insulin, which could potentially influence gastric acid secretion, gastric 
motility and/or lower esophageal sphincter function.

PRELIMINARY DATA  
In a recently completed study designed to investigate the effects of a high fat diet on 
cardiometabolic outcomes in 144 obese adults (Silver and Niswender), we found that 36 
of 144 (25%) had a history of GERD symptoms and/or medication use at least once a 
week at baseline.  
Closer assessment of subjects’ dietary intakes revealed that subjects with GERD had 
significantly higher energy intakes, simple carbohydrate intakes (total sugar), sucrose 
intakes, and overall dietary glyce mic load – but not higher dietary fat or protein intakes 
(Table 1). In addition, there was no difference in subjects’ intakes of caffeine, as well as 
alcohol, chocolate or other dietary factors commonly associated with GERD (data not 
shown). Notably, in re gression modeling, total sugar intake was a strong predictor of 
having GERD symptoms ( p = 0.007).

5.0 Screening & Enrollment   
 
Protocol  Version  #: 3.0 3.1 3.3.  14 
Protocol Date: February 4, [ADDRESS_728621] relevant diagnoses (i.e., ICD -9 codes 530.81 and 
530.11) and are scheduled to come to a given clinic on a specific day. Our study nurse 
will work closely with char ge nurses and clinic staff to identify potential subjects. Upon 
review of pharmaco -economic data from TVHS, we have identified that 45% of the total 
TVHS veteran population of 65,[ADDRESS_728622] in participating in this study (i.e., provides verbal consent to 
be approached by [CONTACT_554831]). From our more 
intensive  GI clinical trials, we currently enrol l 30-35% of patients approached (personal 
communication W. Smalley).  
Based upon prior published studies in VA facilities, successful recruitment for patients 
with GERD has been documented from the following clinical settings: internal 
medicine/primary car e clinics, emergency department, and lastly, general GI clinics. We 
will initially focus our recruiting efforts on the Nashville campus, the Charlotte Avenue 
primary care clinic facility, and at the Murfreesboro Alvin  York campus, as a high volume 
of prima ry and specialty care occurs at these three sites.   
A secondary recruitment strategy will involve the placement of IRB approved posters 
and brochures in the waiting areas of target clinics with basic study informatio n and a 
contact [CONTACT_554832]. We anticipate screening [ADDRESS_728623] 15 -20% of Vets diagnosed with GERD will be 
screen failures as th ey will not have pH < 4.0 for > 5.5% of a 24 -hour period (personal 
communications W Smalley & M Vaezi). These 15 -20% will be excluded from study as 
the underlying hypothesis is that low carbohydrate / low sugar diet w ill reduce % time 
with pH < 4.0 to < 5. 5%.  Thus, we expect to meet our targeted enrollment of 1 -2 
subjects per week, which is based on the ability to schedule this number of patients in 
the GI clinic for pH testing. Thus, our recruitment and enrollment go als appear to be 
highly feasible with s uch a huge patient population at TVHS (currently a total of 65,000 
patients; 29,250 of whom are obese, and 19,100 are currently on PPIs, thus ~65% of 
these obese vets have GERD).  
 
6.0 Study Procedures  
 
Randomization:  200 subjects (50 per arm) will be randomiz ed to diet treatment arm. we 
have reviewed drop -out rate from clinical trials in gastroenterology in this population (W. 
Smalley and M. Vaezi personal communications), which would predict a 20% drop out 
rate. The numb er of subjects to enroll reflects a com pletion rate of 80% (enroll 50 per 
arm = 200 subjects x 0.80 = 160 completers). In considering that drop out could be 
higher, we will now include subjects in our final analyses who notify us they are 
droppi[INVESTIGATOR_007] -out betw een weeks 7 –9 by [CONTACT_554833] a final visit at the time of 
drop-out (we do this regularly and get agreement from about 66% of subjects to return 
for a final testing session even if they are not continuing to wk 9).  Randomization of 
subjects wi ll be carried out using unified reprodu cible methods (i.e. saved random 
number seed) provided by [CONTACT_293423] (Slaughter). We will use a permuted block 
randomization scheme, stratifying on gender to ensure this covariate is balanced

Testing Procedures:  
Baseline levels of all measures list ed below will be obtained prior to stud y day 1.  
PPIs will be stopped for [ADDRESS_728624] gastric motility for 2 days, H2RAs 
for 2 days, and antacids for 2 days - prior to testing on study days 7 and 63 . Additional 
blood work will be drawn on study day 57 for evaluation of level s prior to discontinuation 
of PPIs #2.  
Subjects will be instructed to stop eating and drinking, except water, at 10pm on the 
evening before each clinical testing day. Thus, s ubjects will arrive at the VA on study 
days 7 and 63 NPO. Subjects will be escort ed by [CONTACT_554834] 0700. Subjects will be admitted to a private 
outpatient room (has private bed and bathroom). An updated medical history will be 
obtained to e nsure absence of recent/current illness . CRC nursing will obtain vital signs 
and perform the blood draw. As part of the blood draw, female subjects will have a 
pregnancy test (via serum βHCG). The study dietitian will perform anthropometric, body 
compositi on (DEXA), dietary and GERD symptom sur vey measures as described below.

(active acylated form) by [CONTACT_554838]. While several other hormones are involved in gastric acid secretion and 
motility, we have chosen two key stimulators (gastrin and glucagon) and two 
key inhibitors (GLP -1 and ghrel in), as well as insulin, to investigate in this 
proposal utilizing a dietary intervention in obesity.      
• Anthropometrics:  
• Height  (m) and Weight  (kg) measured on calibrated digital equipment will be 
used to calculat e BMI.  
• Waist Circumference”  will be me asured using a flexible tape at the level of 
the umbilicus.45 
• Body Composition: In addition  to total and regional body composition  (fat, lean 
and bone mass) obtained from the Lunar iDXA (GE Healthcare), we will use new 
technology recently acquired by [CONTACT_554839] (VAT) 
– a possible risk factor for GERD.[ADDRESS_728626]: fast, low cost, ex poses one to less radiation, and makes serial 
measurements possible.  
• Metabolic Testing: To capture a more objective measure of change in 
energy balance due to the dietary intervention, we will perform indirect 
calori metry by [CONTACT_554840] 1 and

• 24 hour urine collection: To effectively measure how well the body processes 
food intake  
• Dietary Intake: will be assessed via averaging three 24 -hour diet recalls 
obtained at baseline a nd again within a 7 -day window of each clinical testing visit 
(study weeks 1 and 9). Recalls will be performed by [CONTACT_554841] -pass methodology,48,49 a 
standardized script, and computer -generated prompts (NDS -R, v. 2013, Nutrition

Protocol Date: February 4, [ADDRESS_728627] of 3 recalls will be in -person at the CRC, which allows 
training of subjects in the interview methodology.  
• Medication Use:  will be assessed by  [CONTACT_392577]: a) we will provide subjec ts 
with a notebook that includes daily logs for them to record medication type and 
amount; and b) weekly interview by [CONTACT_57012]. In addition, we now have 
bloodwork being drawn pre and post weeks 1 and 9 that will in form medication 
use by [CONTACT_305693] h ormone levels, i.e., gastrin.    
• 24-Hour Impedance Monitoring: will be performed by [CONTACT_2329] a combined MII -pH 
monitoring device (Sandhill Scientific Inc; Highlands Ranch, CO) comprising a 
data recorder (Sleuth System; S andhill Scientific Inc) and a 2.1 mm di ameter 
polyvinyl catheter embedded by [CONTACT_554842] 6 impedance sensors at predefined 
positions. The pH sensors are calibrated before placement using standardized 
buffer solutions at pH 4.0 and 7.0 per manufacturer. The catheter is placed 
intranasally so that  the esophageal pH sensor is positioned 5 -cm above the 
manometrically defined upper border of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). 
Intraluminal impedance is measured at 3, 5, 7, 9, 15 and 17cm above the LES. 
Data sam pling frequency for both impedance and pH sensors is 50 Hz. Data are 
downloaded from the recorder and analyzed using BioView Analysis software

non- or weakly  acid reflux events are those occurring at pH > 4.  
• Gastric Emptying : Subjects will swallow an activated and calibrated SmartPi[INVESTIGATOR_554811], pressure and temperature capsule. The capsule houses sensors for 
pH, temper ature and pressure. Shape and dimension s of the capsule are: 
 cylindrical, 26.8mm long by 11.7mm in diameter. The capsule has a pH range of 
0.5–9 with an accuracy of ± 0.5 pH units. The pressure sensor has a pressure 
range of 0 –350 mmHg with an accuracy of  5 mmHg below 100 mmHg and 10% 
at or ab ove 100 mmHg. The temperature sensor has a range of 25 –49 C, with an

which is downloaded to a PC computer. The transfer of data to the PC is 
accomplished via placement of the receiver in a docking station which provides 
an interface for data transmission to a computer as well as connections for 
battery charging. MotiliGI software (SmartPi[INVESTIGATOR_4382], Inc. ) loaded on the computer 
supports the d ata transfer, analysis of the recorded date, and displays the test 
results. Capsule gastric emptying time is defined as the duration of time from 
capsule ingestion to an abrupt pH rise (usually >3 pH units) from gastr ic baseline

7.0 Risks  
 
• Following a special diet and kee pi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a record  of what is  eaten and  
medication use m ay be inconvenient  to participant . 
• The participant will be required not to eat or drink, except water, after [ADDRESS_728631] a headache or a feeling of 
weakn ess, or  the participant  may become irritable.  
• Blood draw:  Blood draws can cause redness, soreness, bleeding or 
bruising at the needle stick site. The CRC nurses will be careful and use 
sterile technique. Sometimes peo ple feel faint. The nurse may put some 
cream (called EMLA) on the skin to numb the area so the participant  will 
not feel the needle stick as much.  The numbing cream may make the  skin 
change color, but this is rare.  
• DEXA: Because DEXA is an x -ray, the parti cipants  are exposed to some 
radiation.  The amount of radiation from the 2 DEXA scans is equal to the 
amount of radiation i n the natural environment if the participants  were to 
walk around outside for 17 days.   
• Because the participant will not be taking m edication for GERD while  are 
participa ting in this study, it is possi ble that  GERD symptoms may get 
worse.  
• 24-hour pH Monitoring:   
• Lidocaine:  Lidocaine, a numbing drug, has an awful taste and causes 
a strange feeling in the mouth.  There is a rare side effect that this 
drug may cause hoarsen ess and loss of voice.  There is a very rare 
risk that this drug may cause problems with heart rhythm.  
• Possible risks for the pa rticipants during 24 -hour study include:  nasal 
discomfort, injury to nasal passages such  as nose bleedings, allergic 
reaction t o lidocaine gel used to nu mb the nasal passages for 
placement of tube, and rupture of the esophagus by [CONTACT_554843].  
o Smart Pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382]: You may experience discomfort when swallowing the 
smart pi [INVESTIGATOR_4382]. In rare cases, the smart pi[INVESTIGATOR_554812]. This may require a procedure to remove the pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382]. If 
you have an abnormality in how your esophagus works this may 
increase the risk.

10.0  Statistical Considerations  
Data Analysis: To determine if percent time with pH < 4 differs by [CONTACT_554845] , 
we will use mul tivariable linear regress ion modeling. Models will include basel ine percent 
time pH < 4.0 and other variables key to disease severity to improve model precision 
and the diet treatment groups as indicator variables. We will determine if the primary 
outcome (% time pH < 4.0) differs  by [CONTACT_105150]. We will use a lin ear mixed effects 
regression model to determine if percent time < pH 4 (Y ij) differs by [CONTACT_554846]. The 
model will incorporate the proportion of time each subject is observed so that subjects

 p (p=1,..,4), and i ndependent errors e ij ~ N(0, 
2e).  The time the outcome is meas ured, t ij, is included in the model such that t i1 = 0 at 
baseline, t i2 = 1 for subjects who complete the entire  study, and t i2 = p for subjects who 
leave after completing a proportion p of the  weeks and come back for final pH testing.  
Subjects will be inc luded if p >= 0.8.  
It is understood that some subjects may drop -out, and thus, not return for the final follow -
up visit at week 9, in which case we would have missing values for some response 
variables. Frequently such dropouts are not a random sample of t he entire cohort, and 
Protocol  Version  #: 3.0 3.1 3.3.  20 
Protocol Date: February 4, [ADDRESS_728634] found that about 2/3 of subjects wil l agree to come in for a final 
visit even if they are not continuing to the end of study (week 9). This will si gnificantly 
reduce the potential for missing data. We will also attempt to obtain  the specific reason 
for dropout on a case by [CONTACT_413]. Indire ct information about the nonrandom dropouts 
will be obtained by [CONTACT_554847][INVESTIGATOR_554815]. Thus, the impact of dropout on  our results will be compared 
using assumptions that vary from m issing completely at random to informative missing.   
 
Sensitivity Analyses: We will use the daily diet data and  daily medication checklist (type 
and amount) to conduct secondary analyses and v erify the assumptions of our primary 
model. Summary statistics b y diet group will be calculated to determine if weight loss, 
PPI [CONTACT_3225], total CHO, and simple CHO are consistent with the study design.  We will also 
use the linear mixed effects model to determ ine if total and simple CHO are associated 
with total percent ti me < pH [ADDRESS_728635] data 
to crea te continuous variables of the weekly dose of PPI.  PPI [INVESTIGATOR_554816] a linear mixed effects regr ession model that includes time modeled flexibly using 
restricted and diet group indicators.  An analogous model using weight as the outcome 
will be estimated. Our study is designed for subjects to maintain weight, but if weight 
loss differs by [CONTACT_3148] a rm, it may introduce confounding into our study. We will 
include weight loss as a  covariate in our regression model to determine if our results a re 
altered compared to the main analysis. This additional sensitivity analyses will be 
conducted as needed, for  example where weight change is significantly different among 
groups, to assure e ffects are due to dietary not body weight change.  
Interpretatio n: Given our expertise in nutrition, metabolism and obesity (Niswender and 
Silver), GERD (Smalley and Vaezi), a nd GERD biostatistics (Slaughter), our group is 
ideally suited for executing and interpreting this study. We predict that we will uncover 
key die t related factors driving GERD symptoms and esophageal acid exposure in the 
obese Veteran, and we will develop a predictive risk model based on sound science. 
Physiologically, the proposed stu dy will determine whether changes in several plausible 
gut hormo nes and/or improvement in insulin sensitivity is associated with the 
improvement in GERD with the dietary inter vention .   
Our preliminary data suggest that reduction of simple carbohydrate was  most robustly 
associated with GERD resolution. The current stud y design will more rigorously address 
whether it is simple or total carbohydrate that is the driver of GERD sym ptoms and 
reflux. This has important implications for the development of more bro adly disseminated 
dietary recommendations; a moderately high car bohydrate but low simple carbohydrate 
diet may be more tolerable to certain individuals than a low total carboh ydrate approach. 
Conversely, if total carbohydrate is determined to be the major factor in the response, 
we will by [CONTACT_554848] -fat and high -protein dietary intakes. Such 
approaches are increasingly recognized to have efficacy for weight loss as well as 
improvement in cardiometabolic parameters such as lipid pr ofiles. Although dietary fat 
intake has been positively associat ed with GERD in obese subjects,[ADDRESS_728636] show n no worse outcomes with high fat diets.20-23 Certainly

Protocol Date: February 4, 2016  March 2, 2016 February 13, 2019  regarding the  source and composition of dietary fat intake, as well as the protein load of 
the diet.  
The next level of anal ysis, for example, if lowering simple CHO intake reduces 
symptoms or esophageal a cid exposure, will determine whether it is related to total 
dietary fiber intake or glycemic load. This analysis will reveal the extent to which 
“processing” of food ingredien ts contributes to GERD symptoms. The finding that higher 
dietary fiber and/or low er glycemic load is associated with less GERD would suggest 
that somewhat less of a focus on macronutrient composition (i.e., CHO vs fat) may be 
warranted, with more of a focu s on consuming foods closer to their natural state.   
Finally, by [CONTACT_554849], we 
will investigate relationships for factors involved in plausible biological hypotheses for the 
effects of dietar y carbohydrate on GERD symptoms. Our observation that reduction in 
simple CHO int ake improves insulin sensitivity is consistent with a nutrient e xcess 
mechanism for insulin resistance. The mechanistic link between insulin sensitivity and 
GERD is most often  considered in the context of weight loss, reduced waist 
circumference and improv ement in abdominal pressures, and GERD symptoms. Here 
we investi gate relationships that may suggest that improving insulin sensitivity 
independent of weight loss improves GERD . This has important implications for clinical 
translation, as induction of signi ficant weight loss, and especially, long term maintenance 
of wei ght loss is a major clinical challenge. To reap clinical benefits on GERD and GERD 
symptoms without the require ment for weight loss would be a major clinical advantage.  
While gastrin release is not clearly understood to be differentially regulated by [CONTACT_554850], GLP -[ADDRESS_728637] 
response.  
Thus, analysis of t he data from the proposed study will determine which factor(s), fiber 
or glycemic  load, total or simple carbohydrate, lower or higher fat in the context of more 
or less simple sugar, or gut hormones, should be targeted in next phase larger scale 
interventi on studies. These findings will also drive the development of future experiments 
designed to understand the mechanistic effects of the optimal di et for GERD.

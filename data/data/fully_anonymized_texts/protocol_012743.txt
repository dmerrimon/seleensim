Protocol  Title:   
“A randomized double  blind cross -over trial of continuous  intrathecal  infusion for 
assessing  patients  with chronic  non-cancer  pain who would benefit  from  treatment  with 
intrathecal  drug  delivery  system  (IDDS)  implant”  
 
ABSTRACT  
2.1 Purpose:   
The purpose  of this study  will be to determine  the efficacy  and the prognostic  value  of a 
continuous  intrathecal  prognostic  infusion test in an in-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_391074] s who would have  better  long term outcomes  for treatment  with intrathecal  
implantable  devices.   We  will compare the primary  outcomes  [changes  in pain intensity  
score (NRS),  patient  global  impression  of change (PGIC)]  before  and after intrathecal  
infusion of  an admixture  of bupi[INVESTIGATOR_391075].  
 2.2 Research  Design:   
Randomized, double  blind  placebo  controlled cross  over  study  
 
2.3 Methodology /Technical  Approach:    
The study  will include  [ADDRESS_490767] with saline  (inactive  placebo  solution)  in addition to a test with fentanyl  and 
bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] (active solution).  Patient s will be  randomly  assigned  to two groups:   
Group  I will be trialed  with continuous  infusion  of intrathecal  bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319]  0.625 mg/ml 
and fentanyl  1 mcg/ml at a rate of 0.5-1.0 ml/hr  for approximately  14-18 hours  followed 
by a washout  period of 4-6 hours , before  resuming  intrathecal  infusion for testing  with 
continuous  normal  saline  for another  14-18 hours.  
Group  II will be trialed  with intrathecal  normal  saline  for approximately  14-18 hours  
followed by a washout  period  of 4-6 hours , before resuming intrathecal  infusion with a 
solution of  bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319]  0.625 mg/ml and  fentanyl  1 mcg/ml for another  14-18 hours.  
Baseline  numerical  rating  scale  pain scores  (NRS;  an 11-point  pain scale whereby  0 
signifies  no pain and 10 the worse  pain ever)  will be assessed  and documented  on all 
patients  upon admission  to the preoperative  area.  Intrathecal  catheters  will be placed  in the

operating  room  as per usual  clinical  care at the appropriate  level  for target  dermatomes.   
The needle entry  point  will occur  in the upper  lumbar  spi[INVESTIGATOR_391076]  (most  commonly  T7-T11), under  local  anesthesia with the 
patient  awake and with minimal or no sedation. In PACU,  patients  will be started  on an 
infusion rate of 0.5 ml/hr  and titrated  to pain relief  greater  than 50% of baseline or up to 
0.8-1.0 ml/hr  within  6-[ADDRESS_490768] .  
A clinician  blinded to the treatment  arm will assess  NRS  and PGIC  on the patients  after 
around 12 hours (around  6-7am/ morning  of the following  day).   Assessment  will include  
changes  in pain intensity  score at rest and upon ambulating  or performing  maneuvers  that 
normally  elicit patient’s  low back  pain.  A 4-6-hour washout  period  will be allotted  with 
infusion of  preservative- free normal  saline  at a rate of  0.2 ml/hr,  after which  the physician  
will document  a return  of the NRS  to baseline before  switching  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]  (cross  over).  
 3. OBJECTIVES  AND  RATIONALE  
Continuous  infusion intrathecal  tests are prognostic  clinical  procedures  routinely  employed  
to select  patients  who would benefit  from  implantable  intrathecal  drug delivery  systems .  
Intrathecal  prognostic  infusion tests are often  criticized  as subjective  and proceeding  with 
an implant after a questionable  intrathecal  test can only lead to frustration  of both patient  
and provider.  C ompared  to normal  saline,  bupi[INVESTIGATOR_391077]  a difference  compared  to preservative- free normal  
saline . 
The objectives  of this clinical  trial would be:  
a) To determine  the benefits  of a continuous  intrathecal  prognostic  infusion test with 
a mixture  of fentanyl  and bupi[INVESTIGATOR_391078] s that will benefit  from  
an implantable  therapy  
b) To examine the long-term effectiveness  as determ ined by [CONTACT_391103] s treated  with IDDS  and selected  by a continuous  
infusion intrathecal  prognostic  test. 
4.  MEDICAL  APPLICATION  
 
Targeted  intrathecal  drug delivery  is an established  interventional  modality  in manag ing 
different  chronic  pain conditions, especially  post laminectomy  syndrome , also known as 
failed  back  surgery  syndrome  (FBSS)  and vertebral  compression fractures .  Intrathecal  
delivery  of pharmacological  agents  reduces  systemic  side effects  and the potential  for 
aberrant  medication  use (1). 
  The success  of the treatment  with an implantable  device is strictly  dependent  on patient  
selection.   Currently , there are no unified standard protocols  for intrathecal  tests which  are

considered  prognostic  procedures  for future  implants  (2).  Previous  clinical studies , but 
also guidelines , consider  accept able single  intrathecal  bolus  placebo  controlled injection  or 
continuous  infusion intrathec al test which  mimic  somewhat  closely  the continuous  
intrathecal  infusion from  an implantable  device.   The proposed study  will clearly  address  
the question of placebo  controlled continuous  infusion tests’  utility  in prognosis  and 
effectiveness  of intratheca l drug  delivery  systems.  
 
5.  BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE  
  
Chronic  low back  is a major  socioeconomic  burden.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_391079],  medications,  injections,  minimally  invasive procedures  and 
surgeries,  chronic  back  pain remains  a challenge.  In particular,  patients  with back  pain 
persisting  after previous  lumbar  spi[INVESTIGATOR_351183]  (often  referred  to as post-laminectomy  
syndrome  or failed  back  surgery  syndrome -FBSS)  appear  to be most  resistant  to traditional 
treatment  strategies.  Neuromodulation in the form  of spi[INVESTIGATOR_391080], represents  the best option  at providing  effective pain relief  in this 
challenging  chronic  pain population. While  spi[INVESTIGATOR_391081],  intrathecal  drug delivery  is more  effective  in 
refractory  low back  pain.   Refractory  back  pain following  remote  vertebral  compression 
fracture(s)  is another  clinical  entity  whereby  [CONTACT_391104] y effective  in 
the absence of alternatives.  Prior to implanting  an intrathecal  drug delivery  system,  an 
intrathecal  prognostic  test is performed.   Despi[INVESTIGATOR_391082],  there has been  no consensus  on the method of testing 
due to lack of high-quality  data.  While  some  clinicians  utilize  single  intrathecal  bolus  doses  
of morphine  or other  opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], others  use continuous  infusions  especially  in the setting  of 
combination therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]  (2). Both  modalities  have  been  employed  with the use of placebo  (3, 
4).  The  value  of intrathecal  testing  has been  questioned, as it is unclear  if it really  predicts  
the long-term success  or failure  of IDDS.  However, it is still advocated  as an important  
initial step  before  the implant  in chronic  non- cancer  pain  (5).  
Most  of the current  data available  are derived  from  prognostic  testing with opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438] ; no 
prospective  randomized trials  assessed  the effectiveness  of bupi[INVESTIGATOR_391083].  Our  published studies  have  shown  that combination of bupi[INVESTIGATOR_391084]  (6, 7). 
However,  no studies  have been  published on the efficacy  of prognostic  intrathecal  infusion  
testing  with a combination of bupi[INVESTIGATOR_391085].  While  two studies  used placebo  
saline  injections  during  intrathecal  prognostic  testing , both involved only opi[INVESTIGATOR_391086]  
(mostly  morphine), one in the setting  of repeat  lumbar  puncture (3) and the other  with repeat  
injections  through an  intrathecal  catheter  (4).

6.3 Study  Design  and Methodology   
 6.3.1 Study  Design  
This is a randomized, double -blind, placebo  controlled cross  over study  comparing  prognostic  
intrathecal  testing with an admixture  of bupi[INVESTIGATOR_391090].   None  of the 
procedures  in this study  deviate from  usual  clinical care that patients  receive at UHCMC  or 
nationally.  Baseline scores  using  the numerical  rating  scale (NRS) for pain (a scale form  0-
10, where [ADDRESS_490773]  possible  pain)  will be recorded,  both in 
the sitting  or supi[INVESTIGATOR_84740] (least pain)  and with ambulation  or standing  (worst  pain).  Patients  
will be given  weight  based  cefazolin  (or vancomycin  if indicated)  prior  to placing  the 
externalized  intrathecal  catheter.   Placement  of the percutaneous  intrathecal  catheter  will be 
done  in the operating  room  with minimal or no sedation  in the prone  or lateral  decubitus  
position under  fluoroscopic  guidance.  Needle entry  will occur  in the mid-upper  lumbar  spi[INVESTIGATOR_391091] .  The needle is then removed  and the 
catheter  is secured  in place with steri-strips  and a clear  sterile  bio-occlusive dressing  will be 
placed.   Patients  will then be transferred  to the PACU  where they will be initiated  on one of 
two solutions  that will be prepared  for each patient  by [CONTACT_391105].   The  solutions  will be labeled  as “Intrathecal  solution 1” and “Intrathecal  solution  
2” and will be  contained in a sterile  50 ml bag.   Solution 1 and  2 may  contain  either:  
 
a) Preservative -free normal  saline  
b) Fentanyl  1 mcg/ml and  bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319]  0.625 mg/ml 
 
The content  of Intrathecal  solution 1 and 2 will be unknown to all investigators  and participants  
in the study  with the exception  of the investigational pharmacy.   The  order  of the Intrathecal  
solution (1 or 2) will be determined  by [CONTACT_391106]  a computer  generated  random  sequence  
allocation.   The  intrathecal  catheter  will be attached  to a pump delivering  solution 1 or 2 at 
around noon time, in the recovery  area on the day the catheter  is placed . A bolus  of 1cc will be 
given  through the  infusion pump at  initiation  of therapy  and the patient  will then  be started  on 
an infusion rate of 0.5 ml/hr.  After 3-4 hours  (around  3-4 pm) hours  and similarly  around 6-7 
pm the rate will be titrated  depending  on patient’s  response  up to a maximum of 0.8-1.0 ml/hr.

University  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_391073]: “Determining  the Prognostic  Value  of Continuous  intrathecal  infusion   prognostic  
infusion test” 
 
If the patient  has achieved  > 50% pain relief  compared  to baseline,  no up-titration  will occur;  
i.e. the rate will be increased  only if the patient  has not had 50% or more  reduction  in baseline 
pain on the NRS.   The intrathecal  rate will be kept the same provided the patient  had 50% or 
greater  decrease  in pain  scores  or has reached  the 1.0 ml/hr  rate (whichever  comes  first).   The 
rate will be unchanged from  6-[ADDRESS_490774] (in bed or chair)  and with ambulation/standing. The pain 
scores  will be recorded  and the catheter  will be aspi[INVESTIGATOR_391092] a solution  of preservative- free norma l 
saline  at 0.2 ml/hr  to keep  the catheter  patent.   After 6 hours, around noon time,  the patient  will 
be crossed  over to Intrathecal  solution 1 or 2, depending  on what  she/he had the day before,  
given  1.0 ml of that solution  as a bolus  and then infusion will be started  at 0.5 ml/hr  and the 
same protocol  as the day before  will be repeated  with the patient  discharged  the next morning.   
Patients  who experience greater  than 50% pain relief  (relative  to baseline)  with either 
intrathecal  solution will be offered  the implant of a permanent  IDDS  that will deliver  a 
combination of bupi[INVESTIGATOR_391093]-dose fentanyl .  Patients  not responding  to both solutions  
with greater  than 50% pain relief  will be considered  to have  failed  the intrathecal  test and 
would not proceed  to implant.  The  patients  will be asked  to pi[INVESTIGATOR_391094]:  solution 1 or solution 2 and responses  will be recorded.    Additionally,  pain 
scores  obtained periodically  as part of patients’  usual  clinical  care vital signs  and recorded  by 
[CONTACT_391107][INVESTIGATOR_391095].   Un-blinding  for 
patients  who had a successful  intrathecal  prognostic  infusion test with greater  than 50% pain 
relief  will not  occur  until  [ADDRESS_490775]  elapsed  since the  pump implant.  
 
Outcome  measures  will include : 
1- Baseline  prior  to commencement  of the prognostic  infusion test:  Pain intensity  using 
the Numerical  Rating  Scale [NRS],  patient  global  impression  of change [PGIC],  
Oswestry  disability  index  [ODI]  and painDETECT . 
2- At 14-18 hours:  Pain intensity  in Numerical  Rating  Scale [NRS],  patient  global  
impression  of change [PGIC],  complications  and side effects . 
3- Prior to second  infusion:  Pain intensity  in Numerical  Rating  Scale [NRS],  patient  global

6.3.2 Study  Methodology/Procedures  
The study  will include  [ADDRESS_490777] . 
  Patients  who are considered  candidates  for intrathecal  pump implant fulfilling  the 
inclusion/exclusion criteria  above  and who elect  to participate  in the study  will be randomly  
assigned  to receive treatment  in one of two counterbalanced  conditions.  
  
Group  A tested with continuous  infusion of intrathecal  bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319]  0.625 mg/ml and 
fentanyl  1 mcg/ml for 14-18 hours  followed by a trial with normal  saline  for another  14-
18 hours.  
Group  B tested with intrathecal  normal  saline  for 14-18 hours  followed  by [CONTACT_391108][INVESTIGATOR_10319]  0.625 mg/ml and  fentanyl  1 mcg/ml for  another  14-18 hours.  
  Note  that drugs  will be delivered  by [CONTACT_391109] a blinded physician  and labeled  as 
Intrathecal  solution 1 and Intrathecal  solution 2 to be administered  sequentially,  separated  
by a 4-6-hr infusion of  preservative -free saline . 
 Outcomes  will be assessed  and documented on all patients  upon admission  to the 
preoperative  area.   
The patients  will be taken  then to the procedure  room  and a standardized  intrathecal  
catheter  will be placed  under  fluoroscopic  guidance where the tip of the catheter  will be 
placed  at the T7-T11 posterior  intrathecal  interspace.  Patients  will be discharged  to the 
PACU where they  will be  started  on a  rate of  0.5 ml/hr.  
Six to eight  hours  following  initiation  of the infusion, all the patients  will be titrated  to 0.8-
1.0 ml/hr , provided less < 50% improvement  in pain scores  occurs .  A physician  who is 
blinded to  the treatment  will assess NRS  after  approximately  12 hrs  (around 6- 7 am  of the 
following  day).   A 4-6 hours  washout  period  will ensue  with infusion of preservative -free 
normal  saline  at a rate of  0.2 ml/hr  after  which  the physician  will document  a return  of the 
NRS  to baseline before  switching  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_391096] 6 hrs after infusing 
normal  saline  and switch  then to solution 2. NRS  will be reassessed  around 6 am the 
following  morning.   Add itionally,  pain scores  documented  with usual  clinical  care vital 
signs  will be  captured.  
All reported  adverse events  will be  recorded.

No pain medications  will be prescribed  during the admission.  If such medications  are 
needed,  the patient  will be excluded from  continuing  on with the study  and will be recorded  
as a prognostic -infusion- test failure.  
The intrathecal  catheter  will be aspi[INVESTIGATOR_391097] 
(about  1 ml)  between  all solution changes  and at the end of the prognostic  infusion test  . 
After  the completion  of the prognostic  infusion test, the catheter  will be removed  and 
patients  will be  discharged  home. 
Only  patients  who report  >50%  reduction  from  baseline  NRS  while  receiving  either  
intrathecal  solution will be considered for intrathecal  drug delivery  system  implant.   It is 
conceivable that some  patients  may get >50%  reduction  in pain scores  with both the active 
solution and saline  or have better  outcome  with the saline  solution.  The patients  will be 
asked  to answer  a binary  question rating  preference to solution 1 vs. solution 2.  P atients  
with pain relief  greater  than 50% will be implanted  with an IDDS  and will receive an 
intrathecal  solution of fentanyl  and bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319].  All subjects  with >50%  pain relief  with 
either  or both intrathecal  solutions  will be implanted.  Even  if the patient  gets >50%  pain 
relief  only from  the saline  solution, or the patient  chooses  the saline  solution over the active 
solution  (when  asked  if #1 vs. #2 was better  relief)  each patient  will receive active drug 
after being  implanted . All patients  will be compared  in long-term outcome  (secondary  
outcome  measures)  at [ADDRESS_490778] elapsed  since  
pump implant.   The  six and twelve  month visits  will be coordinated with a pump  refill  visit.

6.4.1 Data  Analysis  
For this study,  there will be two within -patient  experimental  groups  in a counterbalanced  
crossover  design , such that all patients  will receive both treatments.  An equal  number  of 
patients  will be randomly  assigned  to receive the intrathecal  solutions  in the order  of 
Treatment 1 followed by  [CONTACT_75891]  2, or  Treatment  2 followed by  [CONTACT_75891]  1.  
The primary  outcome  variable will be the change in pain intensity  score [NRS] 0-10 numerical  
rating  scale  back  pain score  at the end of the intrathecal  prognostic  infusion testing  period 
around 6am between  Intrathecal  solution 1 and Intrathecal  solution 2. That is, the primary  
outcome  will report  the degree of change in NRS  pain scores  between  baseline (pre-treatment)  
and the end of receiving  that treatment  (post -treatment ; approximately  18 hours  after treatment  
initiation ), separately  for Treatment  1 and for Treatment  2. Changes  in NRS  pain scores  will 
be considered  clinically  significant if they result  in ≥ 50% pre-treatment/post- treatment  NRS  
scores  for pail  relief  compared  to baseline,  in either  intrathecal  solution

Secondary  outcome  variables  will be Oswestry  disability  score, changes  in painD ETECT,  
Patient  Global  Impressio n of Change  (PGIC ) and side effects  (medications)  and complications  
(injections).   These variables  will be recorded  at baseline, at the completion of each phase of 
the prognostic  infusion test , and  at [ADDRESS_490780] for non-parametric distributions  will be utilized:  Mann -Whitney  U test for independent  
samples.  Comparisons  of three or more  groups  will be conducted using a One-Way  
ANOVA with Bonferroni  post-hoc tests to correct  for multiple  compariso ns; alternatively  
if the data are non-normally  distributed  a Krus kal-Wallis  test will be used. Categorical  data 
will be analyzed  using  the chi-squared  test for categorical  data,  or using  Fisher’s  exact  test, 
a robust  chi-square  alternative  that is valid  for all  sample  sizes .

50% in absolute  pain score changes  with the treatment  agent  [∆ NRS  1] and that is 
considered  clinically  significant.  Placebo  response  is considered  20-30% [∆ NRS  2]. To 
identify  a true effect  of treatment,  distinguishable  from  a placebo  response,  the power  
analysis  should identify  an absolute  score change  from  baseline of ≥ 30%;  to identify  a 
clinically  significant  change  this score should change by ≥ 50%.  The power  analysis  is 
conducted to  estimate  the number  of patients  required  to identify  this clinically  significant  
change as also statistically  significant.   
  
Power  analyses  are performed  on the primary  outcome  of interest,  the change  in NRS  
scores  from  baseline to post-treatment.  The power  analysis  software  G*Power  was used to 
calculate the  sample  size for a  two-tailed  t-test for matched  pairs,  alpha  0.05, powe r = 0.8, 
difference in means  = 30%,  standard  deviation of within -patient  difference s = 50%. Under  
these parameters  a projected  effect  size of .5 (Cohen’s  d, moderate effect  size)  was 
calculated,  and 29 patients  were required  in total.  Under  the assumption of  a 20%  dropout  
rate, sample  size was estimated  at [ADDRESS_490782]  a treatment difference at 95%  confidence that  a 
statistically  significant difference would reveal  a true effect , if the true differe nce 
between  treatments  is [ADDRESS_490783]  deviation of  the response  variable  is 50.

7.0 Risks,  Benefits,  Alternatives , Withdrawal  
 
7.1 Risks  
 
All of the medication  and equipment  being  used  for this  study  are considered usual  
clinical  care treatment for back  pain.  There is  a risk for increase in  back  pain with  the 
normal  salin e solution. 
 
Questionnaires/Subject  Diaries/Research  
The questionnaires  and subject  diaries  will be  used to  compare the  outcomes  of each  
week  of treatment  and pose  no risk  to the subject.   
 
Possible  minimal risks  include  potential  breach  of confidentiality  of the subject’s  medical  
record  information  and associated  privacy.  This risk will be  minimized  by [CONTACT_391114]  a unique  study  number.  This  number  will be  kept  in a locked  area with only  the 
study  team  having  access.  
 
Unforeseeable risks  
There may be risks  or side effects  related  to the study  procedures  that are unknown at this 
time.  Subjects  will be notified of any significant  new findings  that become  known that may 
affect  their  willingness  to continue  in the study.

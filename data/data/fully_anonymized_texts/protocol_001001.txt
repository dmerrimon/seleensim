General Information  
An investigation into whether or not 3% [ADDRESS_81812] who requ ire cesarean delivery are typi[INVESTIGATOR_75416] 2% 
lidocaine with 1:200,000 epi[INVESTIGATOR_73803] 3% 2 -chloroprocaine to achieve surgical anesthesia. The utility 
of 3% 2 -chloroprocaine lies in that it has a more rapid onset of action compared to 2% lidocain e with 
1:200,000 epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], making it a valuable medication in emergent cesarean deliveries when trying to 
avoid general anesthesia. However its duration of action is shorter (30 -45 minutes) compared to that of 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_13873] 2% lidocaine with 1:200,000 epi[INVESTIGATOR_75417] (60 -120 minutes). Neuraxial morphine is frequently 
administered during cesarean deliveries and provides post -operative analgesia for approximately [ADDRESS_81813] suggested that administration of epi[INVESTIGATOR_13873] 3% 2 -chloroprocaine prior to epi[INVESTIGATOR_75418].1,2 Karambelkar et al. compared patients given

unco mfortable. The results of this study were that patients who received epi[INVESTIGATOR_13873] 3% 2 -chloroprocaine 
had faster regression of their sensory block, increased IV PCA morphine use at 4 and 24 hours, and 
increased pain scores at 1 and 2 hours compared to those gi ven epi[INVESTIGATOR_13873] 2% lidocaine with 1:200,[ADDRESS_81815] -partum tubal ligations comparing those

If patients became uncomfortable, no additional epi[INVESTIGATOR_75422], with the authors opting for IV midazolam or surgical infiltration with lidocaine. The results 
demonstrated that patients who received epi[INVESTIGATOR_13873] 3% 2 -chloroprocaine had higher pain scores on 
admission to PACU, 33% compared to 0% in the epi[INVESTIGATOR_13873] 2% lidocaine with 1:200,000 epi[INVESTIGATOR_75423] 90 minutes of epi[INVESTIGATOR_75424], however 48 hour opi[INVESTIGATOR_75425] s imilar between the groups.

Our hypothesis from anecdotal observation is that this phenomenon is secondary to 3% 2chloroprocaine 
wearing off prior to the peak action of epi[INVESTIGATOR_75426].  We believe that 
the results seen from Karambelkar and Toledo were secondary to the latency period between epi[INVESTIGATOR_13873]

Study Design  
This study will be a prospective comparison between epi[INVESTIGATOR_13873] 2% lidocaine with 1:200,000 epi[INVESTIGATOR_75433] 3% [ADDRESS_81821] of epi[INVESTIGATOR_75427]. We intend the duration of the 
study to be 12 months and include a to tal of 80 subjects (40 subjects in each group)  
Patients with labor epi[INVESTIGATOR_75434]. The patients will be randomized via a computer- generated random number 
sequence to one of two groups (lidocaine, chloroprocaine) with 40 subjects in each group. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_75435] 3% 2 -chloroprocaine or 2% lidocaine with 1:200,000 epi[INVESTIGATOR_75436] T4 level in 5ml 
increments, epi[INVESTIGATOR_75427] 3mg will be given after d elivery of neonate. The patient will be blinded 
to which medication she receives however the physician administering the medication will not be 
blinded. T4 level maintained throughout cesarean delivery with additional epi[INVESTIGATOR_75437] 2%  
lidocaine with 1: 200,000 epi[INVESTIGATOR_75438]. This is the critical component to bridge the 
latency period between the offset of 3% [ADDRESS_81822] -operative orders of scheduled acetaminophen and ibuprofen, and oxycod one as needed will be 
written.  
3% 2 -chloroprocaine without epi[INVESTIGATOR_75439] a concentration of 30mg/ml. A 
maximum of 20ml (600mg) will be used, which is below the recommended maximum recommended 
dose of 800mg. 2% lidocaine with epi[INVESTIGATOR_75440] a concentration of 20mg/ml. A 
maximum of 20ml (400mg) will be used, which is below the recommended maximum recommended 
dose of 500mg.  
Primary endpointswill be total opi[INVESTIGATOR_75441] 24h after epi[INVESTIGATOR_75424]. Second ary 
endpoints will be time until first opi[INVESTIGATOR_75428], pain (11 point scale; 0 -10), nausea and pruritis (3 point 
scale; none, mild, moderate -severe), total opi[INVESTIGATOR_75442] –  every 4h for the first 12h, 
and every 12h for 24h.  
The patients who  receive epi[INVESTIGATOR_13873] 2% lidocaine with 1:200,[ADDRESS_81823].  The 
patients who receive 3% [ADDRESS_81824] scheduled acetaminophen and 
ibuprofen, and PRN PO oxycodone available for breakthrough pain.   
The adverse event rates of chloroprocaine and lidoc aine are quite low; allergic reactions to local 
anesthetics are very rare, hypotension as a result of sympathectomy secondary to neuraxial anesthesia 
is an expected side effect and is regularly treated with fluids and vasopressors. Local anesthetic systemic 
toxicity is the most serious complication however the risk is minimized by [CONTACT_75461][INVESTIGATOR_75443], small incremental doses of local anesthetics, and ensuring the sensory level is rising 
appropriately with each intervention.  
There a re frequent minor side effects with neuraxial morphine that include nausea, vomiting, and 
pruritis – which are side effects of all opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]. Respi[INVESTIGATOR_75444].

time. Inclusion criteria includes pregnant females, between age 18 -50 years, with live singleton 
pregnancy. Exclusion criteria includes BMI >40, obstructive sleep apnea, drug abuse, chronic pain,

Study Procedures  
Patient will have pre -existing labor epi[INVESTIGATOR_75445]. Following the consent and 
randomization process, the epi[INVESTIGATOR_75446] 3% 2 -chloroprocaine or 2% lidocaine with 
1:200,000 epi[INVESTIGATOR_75447] 5ml increments until a T4 sensory level to pi[INVESTIGATOR_75448]. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_75449]  3mg will be given after delivery of neonate and a T4 level maintained throughout cesarean  
delivery with additional epi[INVESTIGATOR_75450] -dosing with 2% lidocaine with 1:200,[ADDRESS_81826], pain (11 point scale; 
0-10), nausea and pruritis (3 point sc ale; none, mild, moderate -severe), total opi[INVESTIGATOR_75451], and total opi[INVESTIGATOR_75452] 24h. Each patient will participate for 24h. Data will be collected 
and recorded, with paper records secured in a locked filing cabinet.  
Study Benefit  
The study’s purpose is to determine if the previously observed diminished analgesia with epi[INVESTIGATOR_75429] a latency period. If we are able to 
demonstrate that epi[INVESTIGATOR_75430] -ups and epi[INVESTIGATOR_75431], it would support our 
hypothesis of a latency period. These results would help guide future anesthetic practices and reduce 
concerns that some anesthesiologists have in using chloroprocaine for cesarean deliveries. This could 
increase the usage of chloroprocaine which could reduce the number of women that require general 
anesthesia for emergent cesarean delivery. The possible benefit to  patients is the less frequent use of 
general anesthesia for emergent cesarean delivery which is associated with an increased incidence of 
failed intubation.    
Data and Safety Monitoring  
The potential adverse event that could occur is that patients dosed with 3% [ADDRESS_81827] -operative pain medications ordered, they will be evaluated on a 
caseto -case basis with the option of increasing the dose or switching to a different modality (PCA). The 
rest of the risks are those standard for neuraxial anesthesia and for cesarean delivery.

Page 6 of 7IRB APPROVAL DATE: 05/04/[ADDRESS_81828] serious complication however the risk is minimized by 
[CONTACT_75461][INVESTIGATOR_75453], small in cremental doses of local anesthetics, and ensuring 
the sensory level is rising appropriately with each intervention. These and other adverse events will be 
noted and reported in the manuscript; if these events are occurring at an increased rate than what i s 
normally expected then the study will be halted and study design re -evaluated by [CONTACT_5051]. 
The research team will review the results monthly to ensure patients are receiving safe care and will 
notify the Data and Safety Monitoring Board if adverse events are occurring at a higher than expected 
rate. The Data and Safety Monitoring Board will hold meetings twice per year.  
Specific adverse drug reactions that will be measured are local anesthetic systemic toxicity (expected 
incidence 0.03%4), epi[INVESTIGATOR_75454] (expected incidence 
0.35%5), intravascular injection (expected incidence 0.02%6), intrathecal injection (expected incidence 
0.035%6), and high/total spi[INVESTIGATOR_1304] (expected incidence 0.024%6). If these adverse events are occur, the 
research team will halt the study and evaluate these events. As all of these events occur at a rate of less 
than 1% (total study population is 80 subjects, if any event occurs more than twice the study will 
terminated.  
Statistics  
We plan to enroll 60 patients at MHH -TMC and 20 patients at LBJ Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. We intend to include all 
randomized subjects. Patients will be randomized at 1:1 ratio to two arms using the block randomization 
method with block size 4.  
In a prior study of similar a rms 1, mean 24 -hour morphine consumptions in lidocaine and 
2chloroprocaine arms were 4.07mg (SD=6.34) and 27.72mg (SD=18) respectively. We assume that our 
proposed [ADDRESS_81829] deviation to be 15mg. Let µ c and µ l denote the mean 
24hour opi[INVESTIGATOR_75455] 2 -chloroprocaine and lidocaine arm, respectively. We use 90% 
twosided t confidence interval (CI) for µ c-µl to evaluate non -inferiority. The arm of 2 -chloroprocaine arm 
will be considered as no worse than the lidocaine arm if the upper limit of CI is less than 10mg. The 
target enrollment of 40 per arm provides the power of 90.8% for proving non -inferiority of the 
2chloroprocaine ar m given the non -inferiority margin 10mg. If we permit 10% of dropout on enrolled 
patients, 36 eligible patients per arm provide the power of 87.4% for this non -inferiority assessment.  
We will conduct Kolmogorov –Smirnov test to  examine distributions of continuous variables. If normality 
is satisfactory, we will report mean and standard deviation of the continuous variable in two arms. 
Twosample t test will be used to compare means. For [ADDRESS_81830] a 
90% t CI for the difference in mean between two arms (µ c-µl). The upper limit of CI will be assessed 
against the non -inferiority margin 10mg. If data follow skewed distribution, we will summarize data as

For side effects, we will report number of incidences as well as incidence rates in two arms. S core test 
will be used to compare the incidence rates. If a side effect appears only in one arm, Fisher’s exact test 
will be used to evaluate its association with intervention.  
Ethics  
We do not plan on obtaining approval from another IRB. Once it has been  determined that a patient will 
require cesarean delivery, an investigator will obtain consent and describe the research project. If 
necessary, live or electronic translation services will be employed.  
Data handling and record keepi[INVESTIGATOR_75459]. These paper records will be secured in a locked filing cabinet. These data will then be 
deidentified and transferred to a password protected spreadsheet document.  
Quality control and assurance  
The steps that will be taken to assure that the data collected are accurate, consistent, complete, and 
reliable will be periodic reviews of patients’ electronic medical records to ensure that our data collected 
is consistent wit h what has been documented by [CONTACT_75462]. We do not plan to have ongoing third 
party monitoring.  
Publication Plan  
We plan to publish our research results in an obstetric anesthesiology journal. We do not plan to return 
any results to the research subje cts unless they specifically request them.

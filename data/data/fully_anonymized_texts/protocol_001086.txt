This information is confidential or privileged information and trade secrets of Endocyte, Inc. Clinical Trial Summary 
Protocol title:  VISION: An international, prospective, open label, multicenter, randomized Phase 3 
study of 177Lu-PSMA -617 in the treatment of patients with progressive PSMA -
positive metastatic castration -resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC)  
Clinical phase:  Phase 3  
Objecti ves: The primary objective of this study is to compare the two alternate primary endpoints of radiographic progression- free survival (rPFS) and overall survival (OS) 
in patients with progressive PSMA -positive mCRPC who receive 
177Lu-PSMA -[ADDRESS_897853] supportive/best standard of care versus patients treated with best 
supportive/best standard of care alone.  
Key secondary objectives are an arm -to-arm comparison of the following:  
• Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) response  
• Time to a first symptomatic skeletal event (SSE)  
Additional Secondary Objectives:  
• Safety and tolerability of 177Lu-PSMA -617 
• Health -related quality of life (HRQoL; EQ -5D-5L, FACT -P and Brief Pain 
Inventory – Short Form (BPI -SF)) 
• Health economics  
• Progression- free survival (PFS) (radiographic, clinical, or prostate -specific 
antigen [PSA] progression -free survival)  
• Biochemical response as measured by [CONTACT_43876]. Alkaline phosphatase [ALP] 
levels and lactate dehydrogenase [LDH] levels will also be measured.  
Study des ign: Patients with PSMA positive scans will be randomized in a 2:[ADDRESS_897854] supportive/best standard of care or to receive best 
supportive/best standard of care only. Best supportive/best standard of care will be 
determined by [CONTACT_1963]/investigator but will exclude investigational 
agents, cytotoxic chemotherapy, immunotherapy, other systemic radioisotopes, and hemi -body radiotherapy. Novel androgen axis drugs [NAADs] (such as abiraterone 
or enzalutamide)  are allowed.  
The care of cancer patients must include cancer specialists accomplished in the care of patients with advanced prostate cancer, (e.g., medical, radiation oncologists) with a clear understanding of the PCWG3 2+2 rules for progression, managem ent of 
adverse events (AEs) related to the natural course of the disease, as well as pre-existing AEs and study -related AEs.  
The study is open -label and patients will be monitored throughout the [ADDRESS_897855] accrued. At time of the rPFS primary analysis, there will also be an interim analysis of OS.  
 
Before final analysis of alternate primary endpoint OS:  
When a patient discontinues from the treatment portion of the study, they will have 
an end of treatment visit and will then continue to be followed in long -term follow -
up.  
A long -term follow -up period will include the collection of rPFS survival and 
information about new treatments, along with the patient’s response to these 
treatments, adverse events assessment, and hematology and chemistry testing. 
During follow -up, patients will be contact[CONTACT_457] 3 months (±1  month) via phone, 
email, or letter for up to [ADDRESS_897856] occurred.

status updates which may include, in addition to the above, collection of 
radiographic images (bone scans and CT scans and/or MRIs).  
These patients will be asked to sign a separate consent detailing what kind of long-term fol low-up assessments and study updates they will agree to. They will also be 
able to designate a contact [CONTACT_9702] (e.g. study doctor, local doctor, friend, or family member) who may be contact[CONTACT_664774]- up status updates.  
After final a nalysis of alternate primary endpoint OS:  
All randomized patients on the active part of the study after the final analysis of alternate primary endpoint OS will have an EOT visit at the next planned visit after implementation of V5.[ADDRESS_897857].  
The long- term follow -up period in this study will include the collection of survival 
and new treatment information, adverse events assessment for renal toxicity and secondary malignancies, and results of hematology and chemi stry testing. During 
follow -up, patients will be followed for safety and survival. They will be seen or 
contact[CONTACT_426] a clinician every 3 months (±1 month) via phone, in person or via telemedicine visit, email or letter until a long -term safety follow -up study is 
available for enrollment, until death or until withdrawal of consent, whichever occurs first. Every opportunity to continue to collect long -term safety data should be 
made for each willing participant, regardless of gap between release of protocol amendment v5.0 and v6.0.  
The planned enrollment for this study is 814 patients.  
Study population:  The study population includes patients with progressive PSMA -positive mCRPC 
who received at least one novel androgen axis drug [NAAD] (such as enzalutamide or abiraterone) and were previously treated with 1 to 2 taxane regimens. Patients 
treated with only 1 prior taxane regimen are eligible if the patient is unwilling or the patient’s physician deems the patient unsuitable to receive a second regimen.  
Investigational product: Patients randomized to receive the investigational product will receive 7.4  GBq 
(±10%) 177Lu-PSMA -617 intravenously every 6 weeks (±1 week) for a maximum of 
6 cycles. After 4 cycles, patients will be assessed for (1) evidence of re sponse, (2) 
residual disease, and (3) tolerance to 177Lu-PSMA -617. If the patient meets the 
criteria above and agrees to continue with additional treatment of 177Lu-PSMA -[ADDRESS_897858] supportive/best standard of care alone.  
If the patient does not meet all of the criteria or does not agree to additional 177Lu-
PSMA -[ADDRESS_897859] supportive/best standard of care alone after Cycle 4.  
Assessment schedule:  Radiographic imaging will be done every 8 weeks (±4 days) during the first 24 weeks of treatment and every 12 weeks (± 4 days) thereafter, regardless of 
treatment delays, through the End of Treatment visit.  
The previous 2 PSA values will be noted before randomization. Serum/plasma testosterone and PSA levels will be measured up to 3 days prior to Day 1 of each cycle. Hematology and chemistry will be done weekly during Cycle 1 (up to 3 days prior to each time point) and up to 3 days prior to Days 1, 15, and  29 in Cycles 2 to 6 
(i.e. every two weeks). After Cycle 6, hematology and chemistry will be done every 12 weeks (±4 days) until the patient starts long -term follow -up.  
Patients will complete the BPI -SF, EQ -5D-5L and FACT -P questionnaires about 
their pain  level and HRQoL during screening and prior to treatment on Day 1 of

Version no.: 7.[ADDRESS_897860] an 
end of treatment (EOT) visit and move into long- term follow -up. Long- term follow -
up will be extended on this study until a long -term safety follow -up study is 
available in the respective country (estimated in 2nd quarter of 2023).  
Statistical meth odology:  Subsequent to the implementation of measures to minimize early dropouts from the 
best supportive/best standard of care alone arm, the primary analysis of rPFS will 
focus on patients randomized on or after March 5th, 2019; rPFS will be analyzed in 
these patients once [ADDRESS_897861] accrued and the alpha level applied will be 0.004 1 -sided. At time of the rPFS analysis, there will be an interim analysis of OS 
and the alpha level applied will be 0.001 1 -sided; unlike rPFS, the analysis of OS 
will inc lude all randomized patients (i.e., including those randomized before March 
5
th, 2019). Following the analysis of rPFS and the interim analysis of OS, a final 
analysis of OS will be performed when [ADDRESS_897862] 90% overall power and an overall Type I error rate of at most 0.025 1 -sided.  
After the final analysis of OS is performed, additional analyses of the primary endpoints (e.g. OS) will be presented descriptively without statistical inference and at the same nominal alpha level used for the primary analysis for each endpoint.  
Duration of Study:  Total duration of the study will be up to approximately 66 months.

1. INTRODUCTION  
1.[ADDRESS_897867] 70% of the cases are diagnosed in more developed regions due to the use of prostate- specific antigen (PSA) testing, but there is only modest variation in mortality rates 
globally which is driven by [CONTACT_30769], and often castration- resistant disease ( Ferlay et al 2013, 
Bray et al 2012).  
There is an urgent need for more ef fective treatments to improve outcomes for patients with 
metastatic castration -resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Prostate cancer is the third leading 
cause of cancer mortality in [LOCATION_002] (US) men (Siegel et al 2 017), driven by [CONTACT_664775]. Once patients reach the mCRPC 
stage, their expected overall survival is low as was seen in the randomized phase 3 study of cabozantinib vs prednisone in men with mCRPC who had received prior docetaxel and abiraterone acetate and/or enzalutamide; the median overall survival of the prednisone control arm was 9.8 months ( Smith et al 2016). Post -docetaxel mCRPC patients have an annual death 
rate of 73% (Scher et al 2015).  
The median age at diagnosis of mCRPC is 70 years ( Flaig et al 2016). Metastatic prostate cancer 
has a predilection for bone. As a resu lt, approximately 90% of mCRPC patients develop bone 
metastases (Kirby [CONTACT_2297] 2011), and 49% of them will develop a serious skeletal event within 
2 years ( Saad et al 2004 ). Common presentations include bone pain, bone marrow failure, 
fatigue, or complications such as fractures and cord compression. These presentations typi[INVESTIGATOR_664760], which can significantly impair physical, emotional, and functional well- being ( Weinfurt et al 2005). These patients, many of whom are elderly, can be 
extremely symptomatic and at risk of serious  oncological complications. They can be a 
considerable challenge in the clinic due to the symptoms of metastatic soft tissue and visceral disease, general frailty, bone marrow impairment, and because they have exhausted approved

This information is confidential or privileged information and trade secrets of Endocyte, Inc. agents. In mCRPC patients facing advanced illness with little hope for a cure, the focus of 
treatment shifts from active anti- cancer treatment to palliative care for relief of physical 
symptoms, maintaining function, and attempting to improve their health -related quality of life 
(Cella et al 2009 ). Therefore, in addition to tracking essential clinical outcomes, it is also 
important to assess and evaluate changes in HRQoL of such fragile patients as they receive treatment.  
Several agents have been approved for the treatment of mCRPC, and NCCN, ASCO, ESMO, and APCCC guidelines provide some consensus and guidance for their use. Regardless, none of these therapi[INVESTIGATOR_664761]. In practice, abiraterone acetate or enzalutamide are often used in the first -line mCRPC setting; Sipuleucel- T 
is best used in mildly asymptomatic small volume disease; and 
223Radium is used to treat men 
with bone- only disease. Taxane -based chemotherapy is most often used today after abiraterone 
or enzalutamide and for symptomatic patients, particularly with visceral disease. Docetaxel is used more commonly that cabazitaxel. Because both agents have a typi [INVESTIGATOR_664762], they are often not considered for patients due to comorbidity, poor hematological reserve, or patient refusal (Zielinski et al 2014 ).  
Six small published series with a total of [ADDRESS_897868] activity, including PSA decline >50% in 4% to 22% of patients, a median PFS of 2.7 to 4.6 months and a median OS of 7.2 to 12.2 months ( Azad et al 2015, Cheng et al 2015, Badrising et al 2014 , Brasso et al 2015 , 
Loriot et al 2013, Noonan et al 2013). It’s important to note that this is in contrast with the level of anti- tumor activity demonstrated in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_664763]. In that setting, patients had only received prior docetaxel and had not been exposed to prior therapy with either abiraterone or enzalutamide. As these modern hormonal agents have been used in earlier lines of th erapy, the use of a second agent following docetaxel has resulted 
in diminished efficacy, likely due to cross resistance.  
Therefore, there are limited options available to patients who fail or refuse taxane -based 
chemotherapy, particularly if alternative agents currently approved in this setting (abiraterone and enzalutamide) have been used earlier in the disease.  
Prostate- specific membrane antigen  
Prostate- specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is a transmembrane protein, also known as folate 
hydrolase or glutamate carboxypeptidase II. PSMA is highly overexpressed in nearly all prostate cancers, but has restricted, and several hundred -fold lower, expression in some normal tissues 
such as the duodenal mucosa, proximal renal tubules, and salivary glands ( Bostwick et al 1998, 
Ghosh and Heston 2004, Mannweiler et al 2009). Additionally, PSMA overexpression also correlates with advanced, high -grade, metastatic, androgen -independent disease ( Ross et al 
2003). The differential expression of PSMA from tumor to non -tumor tissue has resulted in 
numerous targeted strategies involving both disease localization using radioactive imaging as well as therapeutic intervention, and therefore may be an attractive target for men with mCRPC.  
In addition to the expression pattern, the functionality of PSMA plays an equally important role in its value as a tumor- specific targeting mechanism. Specifically, the binding of a high affinity

This information is confidential or privileged information and trade secrets of Endocyte, Inc. ligand to PSMA, such as the targeting moiety in 177Lu-PSMA -617, leads to internalization 
through endocytosis and a sustained retention of the ligand and its bound radioactive cargo 
within the cancer cell (Rajasekaran et al 2003 ). This functional feature of PSMA allows for the 
development of low-molecular- weight targeted radiopharmaceuticals with favorable 
pharmacokinetic and tumor penetration properties, rather than being restricted to antibody- based 
targeting strategies ( Haberkorn et al 2016).  
The result of both selective expression and ligand- based uptake using PSMA as a target is a 
reduction in background uptake and off- target toxicities as well as an increase in the amount of 
radioactivity that localizes at the tumor site.  
177Lu-PSMA -617 mechanism of action 
The novel PSMA-targeted radioligand therapy 177Lu-PSMA -617 consists of the PSMA-binding 
ligand glutam ate-urea-lysine and a DOTA -chelator, which are connected by a naphthyl-
containing linker. By [CONTACT_8345], 177Lu-PSMA -617 exhibits high PSMA binding affinity and 
internalization, prolonged tumor retention, and rapid kidney clearance ( Benešová et al 2015). 
PSMA -617 was uniquely developed for both imaging and radioligand therapy of prostate cancer 
and can be radiolabeled with gallium-68 (68Ga), lutetium-177 (177Lu), indium-111, copper-64, 
scandium -44, actinium-225, or yttrium-90 (90Y). 
177Lu, the radioactive cargo being delivered by [CONTACT_85268]-617, has physical properties that make it 
an ideal radionuclide for the treatment of mCRPC. 177Lu is a medium -‐energy β ‐-emitte r (490 
keV) with a maximum energy of 0.5 MeV and a maximal tissue penetration of <2 mm. The 
shorter β‐range of 177Lu provides better irradiation of small tumors, in contrast to the longer 
β-range of 90Y (Emmett et al 2 017).  The shorter path length also acts to direct the energy within 
the tumor rather than in the surrounding normal tissues, while the path length is still sufficient to 
create by[CONTACT_664776] d crossfire effects within the tumor lesion. 177Lu has a relatively long physical 
half -l
ife of 6.6 days that combines with the intratumoral retention of 177Lu-PSMA -617 to reduce 
the necessary dosing frequency. It is these physical properties, and the benef it of PSMA -
targeting, that allow for the delivery of effective activities of 177Lu to prostate cancer cells.  
177Lu-PSMA -617 for metastatic castration- resistant prostate cancer  
The novel therapeutic drug 177Lu-PSMA -617 was developed by [CONTACT_664777], Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum (DKFZ) in collaboration with University Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_664764] (Kratochwil et al 2015, Hillier et al 2009 ). Based on preclinical data that demonstrated high PSMA binding affinity and 
compound internalization, prolonged tumor uptake, rapid kidney clearance, and high tumor- to-
background ratio,
 177Lu-PSMA -[ADDRESS_897869],

This information is confidential or privileged information and trade secrets of Endocyte, Inc. salivary glands, however in the prospective study xerostomia appears low grade and occurs at a 
rate of approximately 87% in treated patients. Clearance of 177Lu PSMA -617 from the kidney 
occurs rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375]. To date nephrotoxicity has not been notable in any safety series. There are no 
reports of Grade 3/4 nephrotoxicity in the literature. The exposure to normal bone marrow tissue 
is predictably low as it does not express PSMA and corresponds with normal plasma clearance. There was some evidence of reversible hematological toxicity that occurred following 
177Lu-PSMA -617 treatment that manifested as leukopenia and thrombocytopenia, with rates of 
0 to 40% and 4% to 67% respectively.  
The first published clinical series of 177Lu-PSMA -617 consisted of 10 pat ients ( Ahmadzadehfar 
et al 2015 ) treated between November 2013 and January 2014, with 5.6 GBq/150mCi (4.1–6.1 
GBq/110–165 mCi). PSA decline >50% occurred in 50% of subjects, which increased to 60% 
after 2 cycles of 6 GBq/160 mCi (4.1–7.1 GBq/110–190 mCi). The level of PSA decline >50% (most commonly used to assess tumor response in these studies) has remained remarkably consistent across several clinical  series when 2 or more doses of  ≥6 GBq/[ADDRESS_897871] prospective open- label, single-arm, non-randomized Phase 2 study of 
177Lu-PSMA -617 in 50 metastatic castration -resistant prostate cancer patients dosed with up to 4 
cycles of 4 –8 GBq/110–220 mCi administered every 6 weeks ( Hofman et al 2018, Hofman et al 
2019). The primary endpoints of this study were to evaluate both safety and efficacy, as measured by [CONTACT_267390], bone pain score, quality of life measurements, imaging response and survival. 
Of the screened patients, 70% were identified as PSMA -positive via PET imaging and eligible 
for treatment. Most subjects had been exposed to at least 1 taxane chemotherapy and either 
abiraterone or enzalutamide in the mCRPC setting. In this heavily pre -treated patient population 
with few therapeutic alternatives, 64% of patients on 
177Lu-PSMA -[ADDRESS_897872] 50%, and 44% had a reduction of PSA of 80% or more. In 27 patients with measurable disease, the obj ective response rate in measurable disease as 
defined by [CONTACT_16622] (RECIST) criteria was 56% (complete response [CR] and partial response [PR]). Median overall survival was 13.3  months (95% 
confidence interval [CI] 10.5-18.0). Therapy with

PSMA -positive mCRPC by [CONTACT_664778] a randomized, prospective, 
open- label trial.  
1.2 Summary of nonclinical studies  with clinical significance  
In vitro  PSMA affinity and internalization studies  
According to Benešová  et al, the results of the binding assay of PSMA-617 in PSMA-positive 
LNCaP cells demonstrated a very high binding affinity, with an equi librium dissociation constant 
(Ki) value of 2.34 ± 2.94 nM. The internalization of PSMA-617 is highly effective with an 
internalized fraction of 17.51 ± 3.99 percent of the added activity/106 LNCaP cells (n = 3) at 
37°C ( Benešová et al 2015).  
Organ distribution in mice bearing PSMA -positive LNCaP tumors 
The organ distribution with 177Lu-PSMA -[ADDRESS_897876] completely cleared within 24 hours whereas the tumor uptake remained high or even tended to slightly increase during that time frame. Other organs such as the liver, lung and spleen 
demonstrated low uptake at 24 hours after injection (Benešová et al 2015).  
Biodistribution in Wistar rats  
Pharmacokinetic ev aluation of 
177Lu-PSMA -617 in normal healthy male Wistar rats exhibited 
major renal clearance with no significant uptake in any of the major organ/tissue (Das et al 2016). More than 80% of the injected activity was excreted within [ADDRESS_897877]-administration. However, uptake in these organs, except skeleton, was observed to gradually decrease with the time.  
Repeat -dose toxicity in Wistar rats  
The toxici ty of non- radioactive PSMA -617 administered once weekly by [CONTACT_33980] (IV) 
administration to male Wistar rats over 22 days was tested in a toxicology study. The animals were treated with 40, 160, or 400 µg PSMA-617/kg b.w. by [CONTACT_664779] 1, 8, 15, and 22. The control group was treated with physiological saline. The no-observed-adverse-effect -level was found to be above 400 µg PSMA-617/kg body weight administered once weekly 
by [CONTACT_300222] ( Leuschner 2016). The estimated mass of the PSMA -617 precursor which 
is applied per treatment cycle is likely to be approximately 150 to 250 µg. Using the NOAEL for repeat dosing of PSMA-617 of 400 µg/kg in rats, this accounts for a safety margin of approximately 16-27-fold, assuming that the average patient has a body surface are of 1.7 m
2. 
However, considering that a more intensive dosing schedule was tested in rats, relative to the proposed, and well-studied, clinical regimen of once every 6 to 8 weeks, this safety margin may be a conservative estimate.

2017, Soydal et al 2016, Rathore et al 2016, Rahbar et al 2016a , Ahmadzadehfar et al 2016, 
Fendler et al 2017, Ferdinandus et al 2017, Rahbar et al 2016b , Yadav et al 2017).  
Dosimetry studies have confirmed that 177Lu PSMA -617 is targeted and normal tissues that 
express PSMA are exposed to radiation ( Delker et al 2016 ). These tissues are salivary glands, 
renal, and small  and large bowel. Renal absorbed dose is cleared rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375], and exposure appears 
similar to that seen with 177Lu-DOTATATE. The exposure to normal bone marrow tissue should 
be low and correspond with normal plasma clearance. 
Nephrotoxicity has not been notable in any safety series. There are no reports of Grade 3/4 
nephrotoxicity in the literature. There was some evidence of reversible hematological toxicity that occurred following 
177Lu-PSMA -617 treatment that manifested as leukopenia and 
thrombocytopenia, wi th rates of 0  to 40% and 4% to 67% respectively. Rahbar (2017) reported 
177Lu-PSMA -617 was associated with asymptomatic Grade 3 or 4 leukopenia, anemia, 
thrombocytopenia in 3%, 10%, 4%, respectively. Mild reversible xerostomia occurred in 8% of subjects. N o significant diarrhea or renal impairment were reported from a retrospective review 
of doctor reports ( Rahbar et al 2017 ). 
Hofman et al. presented results from the first prospective clinical trial with 
177Lu-PSMA -617 
(Hofman et al 2019). In the trial, 50 mCRPC patients were do sed with up to 4 cycles of 4–
8 GBq. Prospective common toxicity criteria for adverse events (CTCAE) v4 safety data was defined. He found his regimen to be well-tolerated. The most common non- hematological 
toxicities attributed to 
177Lu-PSMA -617 occurring in >25% of patients included transient G1-2 
dry mouth (66%), G1-2 nausea (48%), G1-3 fatigue (38%), and G1-2 vomiting (26%). The most common hematological toxicities attributed to 
177Lu-PSMA -617 occurring in >25% of patients 
included G1- 3 lymphocytopenia (72%), G1 -4 thrombocytopenia (38%), G1-3 neutropenia (30%) 
and G1-3 anemia (28%). G3- 4 toxicities attributed to 177Lu-PSMA -617 were infrequent with 
lymphocytopenia (32%), thrombocytopenia (10%), anaemia (10%), neutropenia (6%) and fatigue (2%).  
Potential risks of 
177Lu-PSMA -617 include the effects of radiological toxicity, namely 
xerostomia, fatigue, myelosuppression and mild nausea and vomiting.  
Additional details of the nonclinical and clinical experience with 177Lu-PSMA -617 are provided

Key secondary objectives are an arm -to-arm comparison of the following : 
1. RECIS T response to include: 
a. Overall Response Rate (ORR) as measured by [CONTACT_393] v1.1 criteria  
b. Disease control rate (DCR) as measured by [CONTACT_393] v1.[ADDRESS_897880] symptomatic skeletal event (SSE)

3. Health Economics  
4. Progression- free survival (PFS) (radiographic, clinical, or PSA progression -free survival)  
5. Biochemical response as measured by [CONTACT_43876]. Alkaline phosphatase [ALP] and lactate 
dehydrogenase [LDH] levels will also be collected.  
 
2.2 Trial endpoints  
2.2.1 Alternate Primary endpoints  
rPFS and OS are designated as alternate primary endpoints. rPFS is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of radiographic disease progre ssion as outlined in Prostate 
Cancer Working Group 3 (PCWG3) Guidelines (Scher et al 2016) or death from any cause. OS is defined as the time from randomization to the date of death from any cause.  
rPFS will be assessed locally by [CONTACT_25733]. Additionally, patient scans will be collected for 
independent central review. The independent central review will be used to support the primary rPFS analysis. The local rPFS assessment will be supportive.  
The statistical design of the study is such that, to be declared positive, the study would be r
equired to reach statistical significance on either the primary analysis of rPFS or  OS at the 
respective allocated alpha level; it is not required to statistically meet both rPFS and OS to be declared a positive study. Alpha allocation and recycling is used to ensure control of the overall Type I error rate.

Version no.: 7.[ADDRESS_897886] supportive/best standard of care includes available  care for the eligible patient according to 
best institutional practice and at the discretion of the investigator. Novel androgen axis drugs [NAADs] (i.e., enzalutamide or abiraterone) are allowed.  
Investigational agents, cytotoxic chemotherapy, immunotherapy, other systemic radio isotopes (e.g. radium-223) or hemi-body radiotherapy treatment may not be administered on study. 
At screening, potential subjects will be assessed for eligibility and will undergo a 
68Ga-PSMA -11 
PET/computed tomography (CT) scan to evaluate PSMA positivity. Only patients with PSMA-
positive cancer will be randomized in a 2:[ADDRESS_897887] 
supportive/best standard of care (investigational arm) or to receive best supportive/best standard of care alon e (BS/BSC- only arm). Randomization will be stratified by 4 factors (Section 3.4.3).  
Patients randomized to the investigational arm must begin 
177Lu-PSMA -[ADDRESS_897888] supportive/best standard of care and 7.4 GBq (±10%) 
177Lu-PSMA -617 once every 6 weeks (±1 week) for a maximum of 6 cycles.  
After the Cycle 4 dose of 177Lu-PSMA and prior to Cycle 5 Day 1, the investigator should 
determine if: 
• The patient shows evidence of response (i.e. radiological, PSA, clinical benefit) and  
• Has signs of residual disease on CT with contrast/MRI or bone scan and  
• Has shown good tolerance to the 177Lu-PSM A-[ADDRESS_897889] 
supportive/best standard of care alone.  
Best supportive/best standard of care for each patient will be selected at the discretion of the 
patient’s physician, prior to randomization and will be administe red per the physician’s orders 
and continued until the patient comes off the treatment part of the study and enters the long- term 
follow -up stage. 
A patient may choose to discontinue randomized treatment part of the study at any time.  
Before final analysis of alternate primary endpoint OS:  
If a patient chooses only to discontinue from the randomized treatment in the study for a reason 
other than radiographic progression, the patient will be asked to confirm if they consent to continue to be followed for long- term safety, rPFS, and survival follow -up. The patient will 
continue to be followed for long- term follow -up unless they specifically withdraw co nsent from 
long- term follow -up of the study. An End of Treatment (EOT) visit should occur once a patient 
discontinues randomised treatment for any reason (patient or investigator decision, going on to long- term follow -up, etc.).

later), but before the initiation of subsequent anti- cancer treatment, outside of what is allowe d on 
study.  
If a patient discontinues randomized treatment for any reason other than radiographic progression, they will be asked for permission to continue collecting radiographic images (bone scans and CT scans and/or MRIs) for the purpose of continuing to assess rPFS.  
After the EOT visit, patients will enter the long -term follow -up period. The long- term follow -up 
period will include the collection of rPFS (if discontinuing for reasons other than radiographic progression), survival and information about new treatments, along with the patient’s response to these treatments, adverse events assessment, and results of hematology and chemistry testing. During follow-up, patients will be followed for safety and survival. They will be contact[CONTACT_457] 3 months (±1 month) via phone, email, or letter for up to [ADDRESS_897891] occurred.  
Patients who withdraw their consent to participate in the study for any reason other than radiographic disease progression will be asked for permission to continue long- term status 
updates which may include, in addition to the above, collection of radiographic images (bone scans and CT scans and/or MRIs).  
These patients will be asked to sign a separate consent detailing what kind of long- term follow -
up assessments and  study updates they will agree to. They will also be able to designate a contact 
[CONTACT_9702] (i.e. study doctor, local doctor, friend or family member) who may be contact[CONTACT_664774]- up status updates.  
For any of these patients who are unable to sign the second consent (i.e. does not return to the site, etc.) every effort will be made to document the extent of long- term follow -up they will 
agree to. This will be documented in their source records.  
After final analysis of alternate primary  endpoint OS: 
All randomized patients on the active part of the study, after the final analysis of the OS primary 
endpoint will have an EOT visit at the next planned visit after implementation of V5.[ADDRESS_897892] long- term safety data should be 
made for each willing participant, regardless of time gap between release of protocol amendment v5 and v6.0. 
The long- term follow -up period will include the collection of survival and new treatment 
information, adverse events assessment for renal toxicity and secondary malignancies, and 
results of hematology and chemistry testing. During follow- up, patients will be followed for 
safety and survival. They will be seen or contact[CONTACT_426] a clinician every 3 months (±1 month) via 
phone, in person or via telemedicine visit, email or letter on this study until a long- term safety 
follow -up study is available, until death or until withdrawal of consent, whichever occurs first. 
This st udy will enroll approximately 814 patients involving about 110 sites worldwide.

Version no.: 7.[ADDRESS_897893] those 
randomized to BS/BSC only became evident with the majority of these dropouts withdrawing consent to follow -up. This meant that rPFS data could not be collected for these patients which 
consequently could result in bias in the analysis of rPFS. Remedial measures to curtail this phenomenon were implemented and made effec tive on March 5
th, 2019. As part of the plan to 
address the early withdrawal of consent in the BS/BSC- only arm, the primary analysis of rPFS 
was altered to focus on patients prospectively randomized on or after March 5th, 2019; therefore, 
rPFS will be analyzed in these patients once [ADDRESS_897894] accrued. At time of the rPFS primary analysis, there will also be an interim analysis of OS; this OS analysis will be on an intent to treat (ITT) basis and will include all randomized patients (i.e., including th ose 
randomized before March 5
th, 2019). Following the analysis of rPFS and the interim analysis of 
OS, a final ITT analysis of the OS primary objective will be performed when [ADDRESS_897895] accrued. To achieve these analyses, the total number of subjects randomized into the trial was increased from N=750 to N=814. The revisions described do not alter the hypothesized treatment effects for rPFS and OS upon which the study was originally powered. 
3.2 Rationale for the study design 
The primary objective of this study is to compare the two alternate endpoints of rPFS and overall s 
urvival (OS) in patients with progressive PSMA -positive mCRPC who receive 177Lu-PSMA -
[ADDRESS_897896] supportive/standard of care versus patients treated by [CONTACT_664780]/best standard of care alone. The statistical design of the study is such that, to be declared positive, the study would be required to reach statistical significance on either rPFS or  OS at the respective 
allocated alpha level; it is not required to statistically meet both rPFS and OS to be declared a positive study. Secondary endpoints have been defined by [CONTACT_43877]3 as well as FDA and EMEA guidance. In view of the highly symptomatic nature of advanced mCRPC both validated pain (BPI -SF) and HRQoL (EQ -5D-5L and FACT- P) measurements will be collected using various 
questionnaires.  
3.3 Measures taken to minimize/avoid bias  
Patients will be randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. Randomization will be stratified to avoid bias in treatment selection (Section 3.4.3). Treatment will be open -label.  
Reading of the baseline 
68Ga-PSMA -11 PET/CT scan will be done by [CONTACT_664782].

The 68Ga-PSMA -11 radiopharmaceutical will be administered intravenously at a dose of 111 - 
185 MBq (3 - 5 mCi). For background and additional details on 68Ga-PSMA -11, refer to the 
68Ga-PSMA -11 Investigator’s Brochure.

PSMA -11 recommendations. Details of the patient preparation and administration can be found 
in the Imaging Manual. 
The 177Lu-PSMA -617 solution for injection consists of a sterile solution in glass vials contain ing 
7.4 (±0.74) GBq of 177Lu-PSMA -[ADDRESS_897898] supportive/best standard of care regimen and 
IV 7.4 GBq (±10%) 177Lu-PSMA -617 once every 6 weeks (±1 week) for a maximum of 6 cycles. 
After 4 cycles patients will be reassessed to determine if a further 2 cycles can be given for a maximum of 6 cycles (Section 3.1 ). 
The basic principle of 
177Lu-PSMA -[ADDRESS_897899] been conducted and published in over 100 patients. The results are consistent across the studies and demonstrate exposure that correlates well with the expected rapid clearance of a small molecule, and the limited distribution pattern of a PSMA -targeted radionuclide. The primary sites of non- tumor uptake were the salivary glands, 
lacrimal glands, and kidneys, with excretory mechanisms contributing to exposure in the kidneys where approximately 50% of the injected dose is cleared within 48 hours ( Kratochwil et al 
2016). PSMA -negative tissues like the bone marrow, are exposed transiently to 
177Lu-PSMA -[ADDRESS_897900] used a regimen of 4 cycles of 6 GBq every 8 weeks, as published by [CONTACT_664783] 2015. However, efficacy and safety information from 
the prospective phase 2 study suggested that dosing of 6- 8 GBq every 6 weeks for 4 cycles was 
well tolerated and efficacious (Hofman et al 2018).  
Clinical series now show reports of more than 4 cycles of 
177Lu PSMA -617 being administered 
safely as a means to maximize the benefit to the patient ( Rahbar et al 2018 , Kulkarni et al 2018, 
Bräuer et al 2017, Yordanova et al 2017). In addition, a recent review suggests optimal dosing of 6 cycles of 
177Lu-PSMA -617 administered every 6 weeks in a decreasing scale reaching a total 
cumulative absorbed dose of 44 GBq ( Emmett et al 2017 ). Six fractions of 7.4 GBq, delivers a 
similar total dose of 44.4 GBq.  
In the ANZUP1603 study in 200 Australian patients ( [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]), which is comparing 177Lu-
PSMA -617 with cabazitaxel, the dose starts at 8.5 GBq 177Lu-PSMA -617 and reduces by 0.5 
GBq per cycle, i.e. 8.5, 8, 7.5, 7, 6.5, 6 (cycle #6). A maximum of 6 cycles given every 6 weeks

Version no.: 7.[ADDRESS_897901] allocation to treatment  
Patients will be randomized by [CONTACT_664784] a 2:1 ratio to the investigational treatment arm (
177Lu-PSMA -[ADDRESS_897902] supportive/best standard of care) or the best 
supportive/best standard of care-only arm using a permuted block scheme. Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_15006]: 
• LDH (≤ 260 IU/L vs. > 260 IU/L) 
• Presence of liver metastases (yes vs. no)  
• ECOG score (0 or 1 vs. 2) 
• Inclusion of NAAD in best supportive/best standard of care at time of randomization (yes vs no) 
3.4.4 End of treatment visit  
An EOT visit should occur once a patient discontinues the treatment part of the study for any reason (patient or investigator decision, going on to long- term follow -up, etc.).  
This visit should occur approximately [ADDRESS_897903] supportive/best standard of care end of treatment decision (whichever occurs later), but before the initiation of subsequent anti- cancer treatment, outside of what is allowed on study.  
3.4.[ADDRESS_897904] Participation  
Patients may continue treatment until radiographic progressive disease, withdrawal of consent, the occurrence of unacceptable toxicity, or a determination by [CONTACT_664785]. As per the patient’s physician, when the partici pant requires care that is not 
allowed on study, the participant will discontinue treatment and enter the long- term follow -up 
period. While the patient and/or physician may decide prematurely to cease taking randomized therapy at any time, full follow-up of all randomized patients for the intended duration of the trial is planned by [CONTACT_664786]. 
It is anticipated that it will take approx. [ADDRESS_897905] follow -up, will therefore be up to 
approximately 66 months.

Within the first few days of treatment the most common adverse events (AEs) are general fatigue and an increase in bone pain. Symptomatic hematologic toxicity may occur but is not common. 
Every effort should be made to keep the treatment cycle of 6 weeks (±1 week) at the prescribed 
doses. Physical exams, assessment of  toxicities, along with hematology and chemistry results 
must all be assessed prior to dosing with 
177Lu-PSMA -617. At the discretion of the investigator, 
a dose of 177Lu-PSMA -[ADDRESS_897925] be discontinued. Once a dose is reduced, treatment with 177Lu-
PSMA -617 should not be re- escalated.  
If a treatment delay due to adverse event or toxicity management persists for >[ADDRESS_897926] supportive/best

The ECOG Per formance Status scale will be used to assess patients’ ability to perform daily 
living tasks and their range of basic physical ability. A copy of the ECOG scale is provided in 
Appendix 4. 
The EQ -5D- 5L questionnaire will also be administered as a part of this study to assess HRQoL. 
EQ-5D is an international, validated, standardized, generic questionnaire for describing and 
valuing HRQoL ( Rabin 2001). EQ -5D was developed by [CONTACT_157502] 
a simple, generic measure of health for clinical and economic appraisal ( EuroQoL Group 1990). 
This instrument generates a preference- based health -state utility score (EQ -5D utility index) and 
an overall health -state score based on a visual analogue sc ale (EQ -5D VAS).  
EQ-5D is designed for self-completion by [CONTACT_664798]-to-face interviews. It is cognitively undemanding, taking only a few minutes to complete. 
Instructions to respondents are included in the questionnaire. The most recent version of EQ- 5D 
is the EQ -5D-5L, which was developed to improve the instrument’s sensitivity and to reduce 
ceiling effects. The number of dimensions (mobility, self- care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, 
anxiety/depression) has not changed, however the new version includes five levels of severity in 
each of the existing dimensions in place of three ( EuroQoL Group 2015). Full details regarding 
the EQ -5D- 5L questionnaire, including references, are available at the EQ -5D website: 
https://euroqol.org/eq-5d- instruments/eq -5d-5l-about. 
A copy of the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire is provided in Appendix [ADDRESS_897942] -P is made up of 2 parts: the FACT- G 
(general) questionnaire with 27 questions, and the Prostate Cancer Subscale (PCS) with an 
additional [ADDRESS_897943]- G (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy – G eneral) 
questionnaire is one of the most widely used HRQoL instruments and measures HRQoL in four different domains: Physical well-being, Functional well-being, Emotional well-being, and Social/Family well -being ( Cella  et al 1993). The PCS is designed specifically to measure 
prostate cancer -specific quality of life. Each item in both the FACT-G and PCS is rated on a [ADDRESS_897944] system has a number of advantages as a method of measuring QoL: 
• Questionnaires have been developed to reflect patients’ concerns 
• Measurements are reliable, reproducible, and have been validated in numerous studies 
(Cella et al 1993 , Esper et al 1997 ) 
• Available in over 45 different languages 
• Designed for patient self -administration, but can also be administered by [CONTACT_664799] ( Webster et al 2003 ) 
Full details regarding the FACT-P questionnaire, including refer ences, are available at the 
FACIT website: http://www.facit.org/FACITOrg/Questionnaires . 
A copy of the questionnaire (FACT-P version 4) is provided in Appendix 10.

PSMA -617, and through the End of Treatment visit. 
6.2.7 Health Economics  
A health economics (HE) sub -study will be performed. Core health resource use information will 
be collected, using case report forms (CRFs) on days in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_664768]. Data 
collected on concomitant medication may also be used in the economic analysis.  
For the economic modelling, costs will be imputed on the basis of representative country unit 
costs at the point of analysis using standard fee schedules. Health outcomes will be assessed in terms of quality -adjusted life years (QALYs) and incremental cost -effectiveness ratios. Quality 
adjustments will be based on patients’ respons es to the EQ -5D health status measure which will 
be administered at baseline, before each cycle of therapy, and each point of follow -up as part of 
the QoL questionnaire.  6.2.[ADDRESS_897945] for unequivocal evidence of clinical progression:  
• Marked escalation in cancer -related pain that is assessed by [CONTACT_664800] 
• Immediate need for initiation of new anticancer treatment, surgical, or radiological intervention for complications due to tumor progression even in the absence of radiological progression  
• Marked deterioration in ECOG performance status to ≥ Grade 3 and a finding of the investigator that the deterioration indicates clinical progression  
• In the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], it is in the best interest of the patient to discontinue treatment due to clinical progression  
6.2.9 PSA levels  
Local labs will measure PSA levels. Increases and decreases will be tracked to assess PSA responses as per PCWG3 ( Appendix 7).  
6.3 Safety assessments

agree to. This will be documented in their source records.  
After final analysis of alternate primary endpoint OS:  
All randomized patients on the active part of the study at the time of final analysis of the 
alternate primary endpoint OS will have an EOT visit at the next planned visit after implementation of V5.[ADDRESS_897947]. 
The long- term follow -up period will include the collection of survival and new treatment 
informatio n, adverse events assessment for renal toxicity and secondary malignancies, and 
results of hematology and chemistry testing. During follow- up, patients will be followed for 
safety and survival. They will be seen or contact[CONTACT_426] a clinician every 3 months ( ±1 month) via 
phone, in person or via telemedicine visit, email or letter on this study until a long- term safety 
follow -up study is available, until death or until withdrawal of consent, whichever occurs first. 
Every opportunity to continue to collect long-term safety data should be made for each willing 
participant, regardless of time gap between release of protocol amendment v5.0 and v6.0.

This information is confidential or privileged information and trade secrets of Endocyte, Inc. Term  Definitionsa 
Adverse Event (AE)  Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject 
administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment.  
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product.  
Progression of disease is not considered an AE or SA E for this study.  
Adverse Drug 
Reaction  For an investigational medicinal product all noxious and unintended response to a medicinal product related to any dose should be considered adverse drug reactions.  
Response in this context means that a causal relationship between a medicinal product 
and an adverse event is at least a reasonable possibility . 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE) or  Adverse Drug Reaction  A serious adverse event or reaction is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• results in death; except for deaths due to progression of disease  
• is life -threatening;  
• requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081];  
• results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; or  
• is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
NOTE: The term "life -threatening" in the definition of "serious" refers to an event in 
which the patient was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it w ere more severe.  
Unexpected Adverse Drug Reaction
b An adverse reaction, the nature or severity of which is not consistent with the applicable product information (i.e., Investigator's Brochure for an unapproved investigational medicinal product).  
a ICH E2A, Clinical Safety Data Management: Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting. 
b Also referred to as a Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R).  
AE = adverse event; SAE = serious adverse event  
7.2 Evaluating and recording adverse events  
Before final analysis of alternate primary endpoint OS:

8. STATISTICS  
This section outlines the general study design, study endpoints, and statistical analysis strategy for the study.  
All statistical analyses will be carried out using SAS version 9.4 (or later) . The SAP will be 
written and finalized prior to the first planned analysis and without knowledge of any by-treatment group accumulated data. The SAP will provide a detailed and expanded description

Protocol no. PSMA-617- 01 Endocyte, Inc., a [COMPANY_001] Company 
Version no.: 7.0                                                                                  14 September 2022 
This information is confidential or privileged information and trade secrets of Endocyte, Inc. of the statistical methods outlined in this protocol. Add itional analyses, such as important 
subgroups, will be described. 
After the final analysis of OS is performed, additional analyses of the primary endpoints (e.g. 
OS) will be presented descriptively without statistical inference and at the same nominal alph a 
level used for the primary analysis for each endpoint. Final safety analyses will be performed when the last patient is followed on this study until a long- term safety follow -up study is 
available in the respective country, dies or withdraws consent, whi chever occurs first.

randomized to BS/BSC -only arm became evident with the majority of these dropouts 
withdrawing consent to follow-up. This meant that rPFS data could not be collected for these 
patients which consequently could result in b ias in the analysis of rPFS. Remedial measures to 
curtail this phenomenon were implemented and made effective on March 5
th, 2019. As part of 
the plan to address the early withdrawal of consent in the BS/BSC -only arm, the primary analysis 
of rPFS was altere d to focus on patients prospectively randomized on or after March 5th, 2019; 
therefore, rPFS will be analyzed in these patients once [ADDRESS_897956] accrued with a 1-sided alpha level of 0.004. At time of this rPFS primary analysis, there will be an interim analysis of OS with a 1 -sided alpha level of 0.001; this OS analysis will be on an ITT basis and will include 
all randomized patients (i.e., including those randomized before March 5
th, 2019). Following the 
analysis of rPFS and the interim analysis of OS, a final ITT primary analysis of OS will be performed when [ADDRESS_897957] accrued with a 1-sided alpha level of 0.020. To achieve these analyses, the total number of subjects randomized into the trial was increased from N=750 to N=814. The revisions desc ribed do not alter the hypothesized treatment effects for rPFS and OS 
upon which the study was originally powered. 
8.2 Revisions to planned analyses 
Subsequent to the protocol revision, if further changes are made to primary and/or key secondary hypotheses, or  the statistical methods related to those hypotheses, then the protocol will be 
further amended (consistent with ICH Guideline E9). Any changes to exploratory or non-confirmatory analyses made after the protocol has been finalized, along with an explanation as to when and why they occurred, will be listed in the Clinical Study Report (CSR). |Any post hoc exploratory analyses will be clearly identified in the CSR. Full details will be in the SAP. Any deviations from the statistical plan will be described and  justified in a protocol amendment 
and/or in the CSR. 
8.3 Sample size  and power determination  
The sample size was determined based on the alternate primary endpoints of rPFS and overall survival. Planned enrollment for this study is approximately 814 subjects.

1.00. Under the alternative hypothesis, median overall survival on active is assumed to be 
13.[ADDRESS_897959] supportive/best standard of care (active) for a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.00. Under the 
alternative hypothesis, median rPFS on active is assumed to be [ADDRESS_897960] 90% power to test the hypothesis that the HR for OS is 0.[ADDRESS_897961] 0.020. 
For rPFS, a total of approximately 557/814 patients are expected to be randomized on or after 5 Mar ch 2019, these being the patients to be included in the primary analysis of rPFS; with a 
minimum of approximately 6 months follow -up, these patients are expected to yield 364 rPFS 
events which will be sufficient to provide 84% power to test the hypothesis that the HR of rPFS is or 0.[ADDRESS_897962] all randomized patients. These interim OS data will be analyzed with a 1 -sided alpha level of 0.001. Central independent assessments will be used to determine 
rPFS events.  
The alpha level applicable to OS in the final analysis will depend upon the earlier rPFS and interim OS results:  
• if p<0.004 1-sided is achieved for rPFS and p<0.001 1- sided is achieved for interi m OS, 
then the alpha level for the final analysis of OS will be raised to 0.025 1-sided. 
• if p<0.004 1-sided is achieved for rPFS but p<0.001 1- sided is not achieved for interim 
OS, then the alpha level for the final analysis of OS will be 0.024 1- sided.  
• if p<0.004 1-sided is not achieved for rPFS but p<0.001 1- sided is achieved for interim 
OS, then the alpha level for the final analysis of OS will be raised to 0.021 1-sided. 
• if p<0.004 1-sided is not achieved for rPFS and p<0.[ADDRESS_897963] 90% power for OS and 84% power for rPFS; with an overall Type I e
rror rate ≤0.025 1-sided.  
The observed HRs that will meet p<0.004 for rPFS and the interim analysis of OS are 0.745 and 0.701 respectively; and the observed HR that will meet p<0.020 to p<0.025 in the final analysis of OS are 0.824 to 0.823. 
8.4 Analysis populations 
Analysis datasets are defined as follows:  
• Full Analysis Set  (FAS) : All randomized patients. OS will be assessed on an ITT basis 
and related data will be summarized by [CONTACT_29673].

This information is confidential or privileged information and trade secrets of Endocyte, Inc. • PFS Analysis Set (PFS- FAS) : All patients randomized on or after March 5th, 2019. The 
primary analysis of rPFS will be based on this dataset on an ITT basis and related data 
will be summarized by [CONTACT_29673].  
• Response Evaluable Analysis Set : The subset of patients in the PFS -FAS with evaluable 
disease by [CONTACT_664803]. Soft tissue response as measured by [CONTACT_664804].
 
• Safety Analysis Dataset : There will be two safety datasets  
o The subset of patients who received as least one dose of 68Ga-PSMA -11.  
o The subset of patients in the FAS who received as least one dose of randomized therapy. Patient safety data in this dataset will be summarized by [CONTACT_82153].  
8.5 Demographics and baseline disease characteristics 
Demographic and baseline disease characteristic data will be summarized in the FAS and PFS -
FAS for each treatment with frequency distributions and/or descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, median, range, and/or relevant percentiles). Formal statistical tests comparing treatment groups will not be provided.  
8.6 Patient disposition  
All patients who discontinue from th e study will be identified, and the extent of their 
participation in the study will be reported. This will be done for the FAS and the PFS- FAS. If 
known, a reason for their discontinuation will be given. Reporting of patient disposition will include: 
• A sum mary of data on patient discontinuation  
• A summary of data on overall qualification status of all patients  
• An account of all significant protocol deviations 
All patients enrolled in the study will be accounted for in the summation. The number of patients who do not qualify for analysis, who die, or who discontinue before treatment begins, will be 
specified.  
8.7 Efficacy analyses  
8.7.1 Alternate primary endpoint efficacy analysis  
[IP_ADDRESS] rPFS 
Radiographic progression- free survival (rPFS) is defined as the time from the date of 
randomization to the date of radiographic disease progression as outlined in Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 (PCWG3) Guidelines (Scher et al 2016) or death from any cause. rPFS as determined by [CONTACT_664805]. The primary 
analysis of rPFS will be based upon the PFS- FAS and will take place once [ADDRESS_897964] 
been reached. The allocated alpha level for the rPFS analysis is 0.004 1-sided.  
Page 51 of 97 
 
Protocol no. PSMA-617- 01 Endocyte, Inc., a [COMPANY_001] Company 
Version no.: 7.[ADDRESS_897965] model will be the primary statistical methodology used to analyze rPFS 
in the PFS- FAS dataset, stratified for the randomization stratification factors.  
Supportive analyses of rPFS will be performed in terms of (i) a stratified Cox regression model 
on the PFS- FAS dataset with a single covariate for randomized treatment, and stratifying again 
for the randomization stratification factors; and (ii) the same as (i) but b ased upon the FAS 
dataset. The HR and CI from (i) will be used as an adjunct to the primary stratified log rank test 
p-value to provide the quantification of the treatment effect on rPFS.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] OS 
Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from the date of ra ndomization to the date of death 
from any cause and will be assessed in the FAS. A formal interim analysis of OS is planned to 
occur at the time of the rPFS analysis (with 364 rPFS events in PFS- FAS); it is anticipated that 
approximately [ADDRESS_897966] to follow -up or are alive at the time of the OS analysis (for both interim and 
final analyses) will be censored at the time they were last known to be alive or at the date of event cut -off for the OS analysis. OS data will be displayed using Kaplan Meier curves from 
which median OS will be estimated for both treatment arms.  
OS will be analyzed using the same statistical methodology as described for the primary analysis of rPFS. Supportive analyses of OS will be performed at the interim and final in terms of Cox regression model on the FA S dataset with a single covariate for randomized treatment, stratifying 
for the randomization stratification factors. The HR and CI from these analyses be used as an adjunct to the primary stratified log rank test p -values to provide the quantification of the 
treatment effect on OS.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Statistical Interpretation of Alternate Primary Endpoints  
The statistical design of the study is such that, to be declared positive, the study would be 
r
equired to reach statistical significance on either the primary analysis o f rPFS or  OS at the 
respective allocated alpha level; it is not required to meet both rPFS and OS to be declared a 
statistically positive study.  
Note, this applies to OS assessed at either the interim or the final analysis, i.e. for the study to be decl
ared statistically positive requires rPFS to meet its allocated alpha level or  OS to meet its

This information is confidential or privileged information and trade secrets of Endocyte, Inc. allocated alpha level at either  (i) the formal OS interim analysis (conducted at the time of the 
rPFS analysis) or  (ii) at the final OS analysis with [ADDRESS_897967] to Type I error control. These endpoints are: 
1. RECIST ORR and DCR  
2. Time to SSE  
The primary evaluation of these endpoints will be assessed in the PFS -FAS dataset. Time to  SSE 
will be analyzed using a Cox regression model with a single covariate for randomized treatment, 
stratifying for the randomization stratification factors.  ORR and DCR will be analyzed using 
logistic regression with a single covariate for randomized treatment and stratification for the 
randomization stratification factors. The odds ratio (active: control), its 95% confide nce interval 
and associated [ADDRESS_897968] procedure at the alpha level applicable to the successful alternate primary endpoint. This procedure is reasonable given the positive correlation between the two key secondary endpoints. 
Supportive analyses of ORR, DCR and time to SSE will be performed in the FAS dataset using 
the same methods as described for the primary evaluation of these endpoints. 
Additional Secondary Endpoints  
Additional Secondary Endpoints will be assess ed at the nominal 5% level, i.e. there will be no 
alpha control applied. These endpoints will be assessed in PFS -FAS with the exception of safety 
which will be assessed using the Safety analysis sets and are:  
1. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of 
177Lu-PSMA -617  
2. Aspects of  HRQoL will be self -reported by [CONTACT_1962] (or via interview format) using the 
EQ-5D-5L and FACT-P questionnaires, and pain will be assessed by [CONTACT_664806]-SF.

collected.  
Event-free survival endpoints (e.g., PFS, time to pain worsening) will be analyzed using a Cox regression model in the same manner as described for time to SSE except using a 2 -sided p-
value. DCR will be analyzed in the same manner as ORR and HRQoL will be analyzed in the same man ner as pain score over time. Time to pain improvement response after initial pain 
worsening will be analyzed using mixture distribution methodology akin to that described by [CONTACT_664807] 2008 . 
8.8 Safety analyses  
All safety evaluations will be based on the Safety Analysis Set.  
8.8.1 Extent of exposure 
The duration of exposure and dose intensity will be calculated. The relationship between dose intensity, duration of exposure, and frequency and severity of adverse events will be explored by [CONTACT_664808]. 
8.8.2 Analysis of adverse events 
The frequency of treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and SAEs will be tabulated by

Site monitoring visits will be conducted periodically at each clinical site. During site monitoring 
visits the following but not exhaus tive list of points will be reviewed: patient informed consent, 
patient recruitment and follow -up, AE reporting including SAE documentation, outcome events 
documentation and reporting, investigational drug allocation, storage and accountability, concomitant therapy use, and quality of data.

On site, they will review study records and directly compare them with CRFs and discuss the conduct of the study with the investigator and verify that the facilities remain acceptable. It is the responsibility of the investigator (or designee) to be present or available for consultation during such monitoring visits.  
In addition, the study may be evaluated by [CONTACT_664772] (or designee’s) internal auditors and government inspectors who must be allowed access to CRFs, source documents, investigational medication re cords, and other study files. The sponsor’s (or designee’s) audit reports will be kept

This information is confidential or privileged information and trade secrets of Endocyte, Inc. Appendix 7 Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 Recommendations  
The sections that apply to this trial are the criteria  for prostate -specific antigen ( PSA) response  and 
progression, and the criteria  for bone lesion  “prevent/delay  end points”  (progression). It is based on 
the PCWG3 recommendations. Please note that not all the recommendations listed below are 
applicable to this patient population or to the specifics of this study.  
Variable  PCWG3  (2016)  
PSA • Recognize that a favorable effect  on PSA  may be delayed  for 12  weeks or  more,  even  for a 
cytotoxic drug  
• Monitor PSA by [CONTACT_664817] a minimum  of 12 weeks unless 
other evidence of progression 
• Ignore early  rises (prior to  12 weeks) in  determining PSA response 
For control/relieve/eliminate endpoints:  
• Describe absolute changes in  PSA over time  from baseline to  best response 
For delay/prevent endpoints:  Decline from baseline:  
• Record time from start of therapy t o first PSA increase that is ≥ 25% and ≥2 ng/mL  above the 
nadir, and which  is confirmed by a second  value 3 or more weeks later (ie,  a confirmed rising 
trend) 
No decline from baseline:  
• PSA progression ≥25% and ≥ 2 ng/mL after 12  weeks  
Soft-tissue lesions  For control/relieve/eliminate end  points:  
Use Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) with caveats:  
• Record up to 5 lesions  per site  of disease  
• Record changes in nodal,  lung, liver adrenal and central nervous system (CNS)  sites separately  
• Only  report changes in  lymph nodes that were ≥1.5  cm in diameter in  short axis at  baseline 
• Record changes in pelvic (regional) nodes vs extrapelvic (distant/metastatic) nodes  separately  
• Only  report changes in  visceral lesions (liver,  lung, adrenal,  CNS)  that were ≥1.[ADDRESS_898021] dimension  
• Record complete elimination  of disease at any  site separately  
• Confirm favorable change with  second scan 
• Record changes using waterfall plot  
For delay/prevent end points:  
• Record changes in nodal and visceral disease separately  
• Record up to 5 lesions  per site  of spread 
• Use RECIST  1.[ADDRESS_898022] type of progression (growth of 
existing lesions vs development of new lesions) separately  by [CONTACT_3725]. With  additional requirement 
that progression at first assessment be confirmed  by a second scan 6 or more  weeks later.  
(Particularly  important when anticipated  effect on PSA  is delayed  or for biologic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]) 
• Previously normal (<1.0  cm) lymph nodes must have grown  by ≥5 mm in the short  axis from 
baseline or nadir and  be ≥1.[ADDRESS_898023] to clinical discretion,  and 
nonmeasurable. For existing pathologic  adenopathy (≥1.5 cm), progression is defined per 
RECIST 1.1

Version no.: 7.0    14-September-2022 
This information is confidential or privileged information and trade secrets of Endocyte, Inc. Bone  For control/relieve eliminate end points:  
• Record outcome as new  lesions, no new lesions or  resolved lesion  
• First scheduled reassessment:  
o No new lesions:  continue therapy  
o New lesions:  perform a confirmatory scan 6 or more weeks  later 
• Confirmatory scan: 
o No new lesions:  continue therapy  
o Additional new lesions:  progression 
• Subsequent scheduled reassessments:   
o No new lesions:  continue  
o New lesions:  progression 
• Changes in  intensity  or uptake do not  constitute regression or progression 
For prevent/delay end points (progression):  
• Exclude pseudoprogression in the absence of symptoms  or other signs of progression 
• At least two new lesions on first post -treatment scan, with at least two additional lesions on the 
next scan (2+2 rule) 
• If at least two  additional new lesions are seen on the next (confirmatory) scan, the date of 
progression is the date of  the first post -treatment scan, when the first two new lesions were 
documented 
• For scans after the first post -treatment scan, at least two new lesions relative to the first post-
treatment scan confirmed on a subsequent scan  
• Date of progression is the date of the scan that first documents the second lesion  
• Changes in intensity of uptake alone do not constitute either progression or regression 
• Report the proportion of  patients  who have not  progressed at fixed time intervals (6  and 12

 Pain palliation  assessment requires a patient  population with  clinically meaningful pain at baseline (eg, 
≥4 on a 10-point pain intensity  scale) and  response defined as a clinically meaningful score  improvement 
at a subsequent time point (eg,  a 30% relative or 2-point absolute improvement from  baseline at [ADDRESS_898024] 2  weeks  later,  without an overall increase in  opi[INVESTIGATOR_15834]).   
For control/relieve eliminate end  points:  
• Serial (eg, daily  x 7 days) assessments at each  time point can  improve the stability  of values 
Principles may  be extended  for any PRO for which a clinically meaningful baseline  PRO score  has been  
determined  together with  a responder definition that is  based on  a sustained  clinically  meaningful score 
improvement. 
For delay/prevent end  points:  
Patients with  any level of  baseline pain,  including  no pain,  are eligible to be evaluated  for prevent/delay 
end points; those without  pain are followed  for development of  pain, whereas those  with baseline pain are 
followed for progression (eg,  a 2-point increase without an overall decrease in opi[INVESTIGATOR_544602]).  
Pain assessmen t should be administered  at treatment  discontinuation and once again  if feasible (eg,  2 to 4 
weeks  later). 
Time to  deterioration  of physical function and/or health-related quality of life (HRQoL) scores should also 
be included,  with a priori thresholds defining clinically meaningful deterioration score changes that are 
based  on prior published data for the selected questionnaire.  
Refer to Scher et al 2016 for more  details.

CONFIDENTIAL - For Business Use Only  1 Introduction 
This Statistical Analysis Plan  (SAP)  describes the planned statistical methods for all safety , 
efficacy , ,  analyses  for study LDK378A2205 final clinical study 
report .  
The content of this SAP is based on LDK378A2205 study protocol Amendment 6. All decisions 
regarding final analysis, as defined in the SAP document, have been made prior to database 
lock of the study data. 
1.1 Study design 
This is a phase II, multi -center, open -label, five -arm study in which the efficacy and safety of 
oral ceritinib treatment will be assessed in patients with NSCLC metastatic to the brain and/or to leptomeninges harboring a n ALK rearrangement using the FDA approved Vysis ALK Break 
Apart FISH Probe Kit (Abbott Molecular Inc.) test and scoring algorithm (including positivity criteria). The study will enroll approximately 160 patients globally . 
Patients with ALK -positive NSCLC and active metastases to the brain and/or to leptomeninges 
will be included in this study. Patients without evidence of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis (LC) 
will be allocated  into 1 of the 4 arms taking into account the patient’s history of prior therapy: 
prior radiation therapy (whole brain or stereotactic radiation therapy) to the brain (yes/no) and 
prior treatment with an ALK  inhibitor (ALKi)  (yes/no) ( Table 1 -1). The allocation of patients 
into the five study arms are described below.  
Table 1-1 Allocation into Study Arms based on prior radiation to brain (yes/no) and prior treatment with ALK inhibitor (yes/no)  
 Prior Radiation to the b rain: 
YES  Prior Radiation to the brain: 
NO 
Prior treatment with a ALKi1: YES  Arm 1  Arm 2  
Prior treatment with a ALKi: NO  Arm 3  Arm 4  
Leptomeningeal disease1 Arm 5  
1Previous treatment with ALK inhibitors other than crizotinib is not allowed in Arms 1, 2 and 5.  
The description of patients in each of the five study arms is as follows: 
• Arm 1 will include patients with metastases in the brain without evidence of 
leptomeningeal carcinomatosis, previously treated with radiation to the brain and with prior exposure to an ALKi. 
• Arm 2 will include patients with metastases in the brain without evidence of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis, previously untreated with radiation to the brain but with prior exposure to an ALKi.  
• Arm 3  will include patients with metastases in the brain without evidence of 
leptomeningeal carcinomatosis, previously treated with radiation to the brain but with no prior exposure to an ALKi.  
• Arm 4  will include patients with metastases in the brain without evidence of 
leptomeningeal carcinomatosis, previously untreated with radiation to the brain and with no prior exposure to an ALKi .

CONFIDENTIAL - For Business Use Only  • Arm 5 will include any patients with leptomeningeal carcinomatosis with or without 
evidence of active lesion at the baseline Gadolinium -enhanced brain MRI. 
All patients will receive the same treatment regimen regardless of the arm to which they are allocated. Treatment with ceritinib will continue until the patient experiences disease 
progression (in the brain, outside of the brain or both) as determined  by t he investigator 
according to RECIST 1.1, unacceptable toxicity that precludes further treatment, pregnancy, start of a new anticancer therapy, discontinues treatment at the discretion of the patient or investigator, lost to follow -up, death, or study is terminated by [CONTACT_1034]. 
Tumor response will be evaluated starting from the first day of treatment with ceritinib until the 
time of disease progression according to RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_1076597] discontinued earlier respectively. The study will end when both of the following conditions are met: 
1. At least [ADDRESS_1076598] 75% of patients have died, have been lost to follow-up, or have withdrawn 
consent for survival follow-up, or  the last patient will be able to enter into a separate 
rollover study and/or other options for continued treatment, whichever comes first. 
If the end of study criteria is met before the primary analy sis is conducted, a single final analysis 
and study report may be performed. If the end of the study criteria is not met by [CONTACT_782856], a final CSR will be produced reporting all available data collected up to last patient last visit (LPLV) including the additional study data collected after the primary analysis . 
1.2 Objectives 
1.2.1  Primary o bjective  
The primary objective is to evaluate the antitumor activity of ceritinib in patients with ALK -
positive NSCLC metastatic to the brain and/or to leptomeninges based on investigator assessment per RECIST 1.1 . The primary endpoint is the overa ll response rate (ORR)  defined 
as the proportion of patients with a best overall confirmed response of complete response (CR) or partial respons e (PR) in the whole body as assessed per RECIST 1.1 by [CONTACT_1275]. 
1.2.2  Key s econdary and other secondary o bjectives  
The key secondary objective is to evaluate Disease Control Rate (DCR)  in patients with ALK -
positive NSCLC metastatic to the brain and/or to leptomeninges  based on investigator 
assessment per RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_1076599] 1.1.

brain and/or to leptomeninges  
• To evaluate safety  in patient s with ALK- positive NSCLC metastatic to the brain and/or to 
leptomeninges  
•  
 
1.2.3  Exploratory objectives 
• To evaluate intracranial endpoints for patients with measurable  brain metastases at baseline 
in Arms 1 to 4 (OIRR, TTIR and DOIR) and for patients with active brain lesions at baseline 
in Arms 1 to 4 (IDCR)  using the Response Assessment in Neuro- Oncology (RANO) criteria

CONFIDENTIAL - For Business Use Only  The study day for all assessments (e.g. tumor assessment, death, disease progression, tumor 
response, performance status, adverse event onset, laboratory abnormality occurrence, vital sign measurement, dose interruption etc. ) will be calculated using the start date of study drug as the 
origin. For assessments occurring after or on the start date of study drug, study day will be 
calculated as:  
Study Day = Date of the assessment/ Event date - start date of study drug + 1. 
The first day of study drug is therefore study day 1.  
For any assessment or events such as baseline disease characteristics or medical history (e.g., 
time since diagnosis of disease) occurring prior to the start of the study drug, study day will be negative and will be calculated as:  
Study Day = Event date - start date of study drug. 
The study day will be displayed in the relevant  data listings.  
Baseline  
Baseline is the result of an investigation describing the “true” uninfluenced state of the patient. 
For efficacy  evaluations , the last non- missing assessment, including unscheduled assessments 
on or before the date of start of study treatment  is taken as “baseline” value or “baseline” 
assessment.  
For safety evaluations , the last available assessment on or before the date of start of study  
treatment is taken or ‘‘baseline” assessment.   
If an assessment is planned to be performed prior to the first dose of study treatment in the 
protocol and the assessment is performed on the same day as the first administration of study treatment, it will be assumed that it was performed prior to study treatment administration, if assessment time point is not collected or is missing.  
If assessment time points are collected, the observed time point will be used to determine pre -
dose on study day [ADDRESS_1076604] two different sets of data collected on study day 1, one being reported to the cycle 1 day 1 visit, the other reported to the end of treatment (EOT) visit. Data reported at the EOT visit are not eligible for baseline selection.

(periods of interruption are not excluded)  
• Cumulative dose (mg): total dose of study drug taken by a patient in the study 
• Number of dosing days (days): duration of exposure − number of zero dose days

2.7 Analysis of the primary variable 
The primary objective is to evaluate the anti -tumor activity of ceritinib in patients with ALK -
positive NSCLC metastatic to the brain and/or to leptomeninges.  
2.7.1  Variable  
The primary endpoint used to evaluate the anti -tumor activity of ceritinib is the overall response 
rate (ORR), which is defined as the proportion of patients with a best overall confirmed response  
(BOR)  of CR or PR in the whole body, as assessed per RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_1076607] met . The next scheduled assessment may be used for 
purposes of confirmation of response.   
BOR for each patient is determined from the sequence of overall (lesion) responses according 
to the following rules: 
• CR = at least two determinations of CR at least 4 w eeks apart before progression  
PR = at least two determinations of PR or better at least 4 weeks apart before progression  
(and not qualifying as  a CR)  
• SD = at least one SD assessment (or better) > 7 weeks after start of study drug (and not 
qualifying as a  CR or PR)  
• PD = progression ≤ 17 weeks after start of study drug (and not qualifying as a CR, PR or 
SD) 
• UNK = all other cases (i.e. not qualifying for confirmed CR or PR and without SD after 
more than [ADDRESS_1076608] 17 weeks)  
The cut -off for SD too early and PD too late were chosen based on tumor assessment schedule. 
Only tumor assessments performed before the start of any further anti -neoplastic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (i.e. 
any additional secondary anti -neoplastic therapy or anti -cancer surger y) will be considered in 
[COMPANY_001]  Confidential  Page 19  
16-Jan-2020 (11:03)   LDK378A2205 SAP Amendment 1.0  
 
CONFIDENTIAL - For Business Use Only  the assessment of BOR.  If a patient receives any further anti -neoplastic therapy while on study, 
any subsequent assessments will be excluded from the BOR determination. Further  anti-
neoplastic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_782845] ‘Anti -neoplastic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_782846]’ as appropriate. Clinical deterioration will not be considered as 
documented disease progression. Patients with BOR ‘unknown’ will be summarized by [CONTACT_674781]. The following reasons will be used: 
• No valid post- baseline assessment  
• All post- baseline assessments have overall response UNK  
• New anti -neoplastic therapy started before first post- baseline assessment  
• Stable disease (SD) too early (≤ 7 weeks after start d ate of study drug) 
• PD too late (> 17 weeks after start date of study drug). 
Special (and rare) cases where BOR is ‘unknown’ due to both early SD and late PD will be 
classified as ‘SD too early’.  In case, a patient had only a non- measurable disease at basel ine, 
same cut -off (≤ 7 weeks after start date of study drug) will be applied for a response  of non -
CR/non-PD too early. 
2.7.2  Statistical hypothesis, model, and method of analysis  
The primary efficacy analysis will be performed on the FAS. This is a n estimation based study 
and no statistical testing of hypothesis will be conducted.  
The primary efficacy endpoint ORR  per investigator  in the whole body will be estimated and 
the 95% exact binomial ( Clopper and Pearson 1934) confidence intervals (CIs) will be provided  
by [CONTACT_782870] . Exact binomial  confidence intervals will be used since the 
confidence limits based on the normal approximation are not bounded by [CONTACT_941] [0, 1] interval, 
meaning that for rates close to 0 or 1, the upper limit of the normal approximation interval for the proportion could exceed 1 or the lower limit could be negative.  
Additionally, the ORR in the whole body will also be  summarized by [CONTACT_782860], 
prior ALK inhibitor use and overall using the data from Arms 1 through 4.  
2.7.3  Handling of missing values/censoring/discontinuations  
Confirmed PR or CR reported prior to any additional anticancer therapy will be considered as 
responses in the calculation of the ORR , irrespective of the number of missed assessments 
before response.  
Patients with a best overall response (BOR) of ‘Unknown’ per RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_1076609] percentage change from baseline in the sum of the tumor  
diameters for target lesions will be produced by [CONTACT_782873] (Yes/No) for FAS . See

The DCR will also be summarized by [CONTACT_782879]. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Other secondary endpoints  
The following intracranial, extracranial  and whole body (for lesions in and outside  the brain ) 
tumor- response related endpoints will be assessed separately based on investigator assessment  
and BIRC assessment  per RECIST 1.1 ( OERR, EDCR, TTER, DOER , ORR, DCR, T TR, DOR 
and PFS) or Modified RECIST 1.1 (OIRR, IDCR, TTIR, DOIR). 
[IP_ADDRESS].1  Intracranial endpoints  
Overall intracranial response rate (OIRR ): OIRR is calculated based on response 
assessments in the brain for patients having measurable brain metastases at baseline. The OIRR 
is defined as the proportion of patients with a best overall confirmed response of CR or PR in the brain as assessed per modified RECIST 1.1.  
OIRR will be estimated and the exact binomial 95% CI will be presented  by [CONTACT_782880] . OIRR will also be summarized by [CONTACT_782881] (yes, no) and prior

Same analysis on OIRR will be conducted for patients having evaluable (measurable or non-
measurable) brain metastases at baseline.  
Intracranial disease control rate ( IDCR) at 8 and 16 weeks and overall : IDCR is calculated 
based on response assessments in the brain for patients having evaluable (measurable or non-measurable) brain metastases at baseline. In what follows, CR, PR and SD are possible 
responses only for patients with measurable brain metastases at baseline, while non -CR/non-
PD is a possible response only for patients without measurable brain metastases at baseline. 
• The IDCR at 8 and 16 weeks is defined as the proportion of patients with CR, PR, SD or non-CR/non- PD assessment in the brain  at Week 8 and Week 16 intracranial tumor 
evaluations respectively , taking into consideration 4- week window for each 
assessment, i.e.,  assessment done between study day 29 and 85 (both inclusive) for 
week 8 and study day 86 and 141 (both inclusive) for week 16, as per modified RECIST 1.1. If there are multiple tumor assessments within the defined window, the following rules should be used hierarchically to select the overall response contributing to the xx- week IDCR rate:  
1) PD - If at least one tumor assessment with overall response of PD;  
2) Unknown - if all tumor assessment with overall responses of unknown;

Same analysis on overall IDCR will be conducted for patients having measurable brain 
metastases at baseline.  
Time to intracranial tumor respo nse (TTIR): TTIR  is defined as the time from the date of 
the first dose of ceritinib to the date of the first documented response (CR or PR) in the brain 
as assessed per  modified  RECIST 1.1 criteria  for patients with measurable brain metastases at 
baseline. 
TTIR will be summarized by [CONTACT_782883]. These analyses of TTIR will be performed separately based on in vestigator and BIRC 
assessment.  
Same analysis on TTIR will be conducted for patients having evaluable (measurable or non-
measurable) brain metastases at baseline.  
Duration of intracranial response (DOIR) : Among patients with measurable brain metastases 
at baseline and a confirmed response (PR or CR) in the brain per Modified RECIST 1.1, DOIR 
is defined as the time from the first documented response (PR or CR) in the brain to the date of 
the first documented disease progression in the brain or death due to any cause. If a patient has not had an event, DOI R is censored at the date of last adequate tumor assessment . 
The censoring and event date options to be considered for the main analysis are presented in Table 2 -2. Please note that the intracranial/extracranial/whole body tumor assessments apply to 
intracranial (DOIR), extracranial (DOER) and whole body (DOR and PFS) endpoints, respectively.

pre-treatment and post-treatment period will be flagged in all the listings . 
Adverse events (AEs)   
AEs will be coded using MedDRA using the latest version available prior to clinical database 
lock and will be gra ded using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events ( CTCAE)  
version 4.03. I f CTCAE grading exist s for an AE, grades 1, 2, 3, or 4 corresponding to the 
severity of mild, moderate, severe, and life -threatening, respectively,  will be used. CTCAE 
grade 5 ( death)  will not be used in this study; rather, this information will be collected on the 
“End of Treatment Dispo sition ”, “End of Post Treatment Phase Disposition” or “Death” eCRF 
pages.  
All AE summaries will be summarized (fre quency counts and percentages) by [CONTACT_782898] (SOC) and/or preferred term  (PT), maximum severity grades, and relation to study 
drug except where otherwise noted.  A patient with multiple CTC grades for an AE will be 
summarized under the maxim um CTC grade recorded for the event.  
The following AE  summaries will be produced: 
• AEs regardless of study drug relationship 
• AEs suspected to be study drug related 
• All deaths , by [CONTACT_782899]  
• On treatment deaths, by [CONTACT_183008]

Laboratory data  
For laboratory data assessments, data from all sources (central and local laboratories) will be 
combined. The summaries will include all laboratory assessments collected in the on- treatment 
period. All laboratory assessments will be listed and those collec ted prior to first dose of study 
drug or later than 30 days after study drug discontinuation will be flagged in the listings.  
Laboratory data will be classified (by [CONTACT_782900] ) into CTC 
grades according to the NCI CTCAE v4.03. For all reports, CTC grade is always obtained on 
the converted measurement in SI unit.  Grade 5 will not be used. The CTC grade 0 will be

where RR represents the RR interval of the ECG, in seconds.   
Although Bazett’s correction is the historical standard, it does not perform  well when heart rate 
fluctuates. Fridericia’s formula may perform better under these conditions.  An alternate 
correction to achieve the goal of getting uncorrelated QTc and RR is based on linear or log-linear regression methods which yield, theoretically , uncorrelated QTc and RR.  
Linear regression method: 
• Fit a model QT = a + b * RR to baseline data  
• Use the estimated slope,  , 𝑏𝑏� , to correct QT  
• Corrected QT for heart rate will be computed as follows:  
QTcP = QT + 𝑏𝑏� * (1- RR)  
Data will be summarize d using QTcF and QTcB. However, if these are not appropriate for the 
data set due to an observed large correlation between corrected QT and HR using the baseline 
assessments, the results will also be summarized using QTcP.

An additional secondary objective of the study is estimation of the OIRR for patients with 
measurable brain metastases at baseline. As described in Section 4.1.1 of the study protocol , 
the study targets enrolling approximately 70 patients with measurable b rain metastases: ~ 50 
patients with prior ALKi treatment (Arms 1 and 2)  and ~ 20 patients with no prior ALKi 
treatment (Arms 3 and 4). An observed OIRR of 50% in [ADDRESS_1076633] binomial 95% CI with a lowe r bound greater than 35%. An 
observed OIRR of 60 % in 50 patients with measurable brain metastases previously treated with 
ALKi (Arms 1 and 2)  will result in an exact binomial 95% CI with a  lower bound greater than 
45%. An observed OIRR of 60% in 20 patients with measurable brain metastases not previously 
treated with ALKi (Arms 3 and 4)  will result in an exact binomial 95% CI with a lower bound 
greater than 36%  (Table 2 -6). The reported OIRR with c rizotinib is 18% (95% CI: 5 - 40) for 
patients with measurable brain metastases and prior radiation therapy to the brain, and 33% (95% CI: 13 - 59) for patients without prior radiation to the brain; recent whole brain radiation was 
allowed ( Crino et al 2013 ).

4.3 Month derivation 
For all derivations, a  month will be calculated as (365.25 / 12) = 30.4375 days. If duration is to 
be reported in months, duration in days will be divided by 30.4375. 
4.4 Age derivation 
Age for enrolled  patients or screen failures will be calculated based on the date when the patient 
signed the main study informed consent from the date of birth. 
4.5 Dose interruptions and dose changes 
This section provides additional details to those included in Section 2.6. Both dose interruption 
and dose change are analyzed based on CRF pages  based on the dose actually taken by [CONTACT_493200] . 
An interruption is defined as a 0 mg dose taken on one or more days. What follows defines how 
dose interruptions will be counted in the case of multiple dose interruptions. 
• If an interruption occurs consecutively for at least two days due to the same reason, then it 
will be counted only once ( example: If the actual dose on days 1- 3 is 750 mg and actual 
[COMPANY_001]  Confidential  Page 40  
16-Jan-2020 (11:03)   LDK378A2205 SAP Amendment 1.0  
 
CONFIDENTIAL - For Business Use Only  dose on days 4 -5 is 0 mg and dose interruption on days 4- 5 is due to AE, then the total 
number of dose interruptions is 1).  
• If an interruption occurs consecutively for at least two days due to different reasons, then it 
will be counted for each reason ( example: If the actual dose on days 1- 3 is 750 mg and 
actual dose on days 4 -5 is 0 mg and dose interruption on day 4 is due to AE and dose 
interruption on day 5 is due to dosing error, then the total number of dose interruptions is 2).  
• If an interru ption occurs for more than one day due to the same reason, but the days are not 
consecutive , i.e. there is at least one dosing day in between, then each dose interruption will be counted as a different occurrence ( example: if the actual dose on days 1, 3 and 5, is 
750 mg and actual dose on days 2 and 4 is 0mg, and dose interruptions on day 2 and 4 are both due to dosing error, the total number of dose interruptions is 2).  
A dose change is defined as a change in dosing from one record to the next. However, a dose interruption will not be counted as a dose change.  For example, for LDK378, in the sequence 
750 mg – 0 mg – 600 mg, the 600 mg dose will be counted as a dose change (with reason documented), preceded by a 0 mg due to interruption (with reason documented) . Dose 
reductions are a subset of dose changes where dose changes to higher than protocol planned 
dose are excluded . 
4.6 Efficacy endpoints  
For further details on efficacy endpoints, see Section 14 (Appendixes  2 and 3) of the 
LDK378A2205 protocol. For the evaluation of tumor -response related endpoints, response is 
assessed by [CONTACT_782910] 1.[ADDRESS_1076637] 1.1  (whole body and extracranial)  or Modified RECIST 1.1 ( intracranial ) (e.g. 
radiologic scan, histology for bronchoscopy, photos for skin lesions). If a new lesion is detected 
using an objective assessment method other than radiologic scan, it should be entered on the 
‘New lesion’ RECIST eCRF with appropriate method (or method=‘Other’).  
In particular, discontinuation due to disease progression or death due to progressive disease , 
without supporting objective evidence (as defined above), will not be considered as PD in the 
determination of BOR, the derivation of any efficacy endpoint or efficacy analysis.  
Change in imaging modality  
Per RECIST 1.1, a change in methodology can be defined as either a change in contrast use (e.g. 
keepi[INVESTIGATOR_157809], like CT, but switching from with to without contrast use or vice -
versa, regardless of the justification for the change) or a change in technique (e.g. from CT to 
[COMPANY_001]  Confidential  Page 41  
16-Jan-2020 (11:03)   LDK378A2205 SAP Amendment 1.0  
 
CONFIDENTIAL - For Business Use Only  MRI, or vice -versa), or a change in any other imaging modality. A change from conventional 
to spi[INVESTIGATOR_782850] (e.g. switching from spi[INVESTIGATOR_782851]) is not considered a change in imaging modality . 
A change in methodology will result by [CONTACT_15074] a UNK (unknown) overall lesion response 
assessment. However, a response assessment other than the [COMPANY_001] calculated UNK response may be accepted from the investigator or BIRC if a definitive response assessment can be justified based on the available information. Potential discrepancies between the modality used and overall lesion response reported by [CONTACT_093] (e.g. change in modality but investigator assessment of response is different from UNK ) will be queried during the data validation 
process.  
Determination of missing adequate tumor assessments  
For the computation of ORR  (for primary analysis), patients without any radiological 
assessment after the start date of study drug will be counted as failure.  
Partial or complete responses reported prior to any additional anticancer therapy will be considered for ORR computation irrespective of the number of missed assessments before response. The anticancer therapy will be defined for intracranial, extracranial and whole body 
separately : e.g., radiotherapy to the brain wil only be considered as anticancer therapy for 
intracranial and whole body endpoints but not for extracranial endpoint. In this section, the 
‘missing adequate assessment’ is defined as assessment not done or assessment with overall lesion res ponse equal to UNK.  For the sake of simplicity, the ‘missing adequate assessment’ 
will also be referred as ‘missing assessment’.  
As detailed in Section 14 (Appendix 2) of the LDK378A2205 protocol and Table [ADDRESS_1076638] adequate tumor assessment date and the event date.  
If the distance is larger  than threshold D
1 or D 2 then the analysis will assume one or two missing 
assessments, respectively. The threshold D 1 will be defined as the protocol specified interval 
between the tumor assessments plus the protocol allowed window around the assessments. Similarly, the threshold D
2 is defined as two times the protocol specified interval between the 
tumor assessments plus the protocol allowed window around the assessments. In this study, the protocol defined schedule of tumor assessment is every 8 weeks and each assessment is 
expected to be performed at the scheduled time point plus or minus 1 week, i.e. the window is 2 week s, then any distance larger than D
1 = 8+2 = 10 weeks means one missing assessment and 
any distance larger than D 2 = (2*8) + 2 = 1 8 weeks  means two missing assessments.  
The same definition of D 2 will be used to determine the PFS censoring reason.  
Possible censoring reasons for PFS are: 
1: Ongoing without event 2: Lost to follow-up

CONFIDENTIAL - For Business Use Only  3: Withdrew consent 
4: Adequate assessment no longer available 5: Event after >=2 missing tumor assessments  
Non-measurable disease at baseline  
As specified in Section 14 (Appendix 2) of the LDK378A2205 protocol, the RECIST 1.1 
criteria imply  that only patients with measurable disease at baseline  (at least one extracranial 
measurable lesion  as per inclusion criteria ) should be included in the study. If a patient without 
measurable disease is enrolled, the intent -to-treat (ITT) principle requires including these 
patients in the analys es. Hence, analyses will be based on FAS including patients with either 
measurable or non- measurable disease. Therefore, a rule needs to be specified on how to handle 
these cases.  
As specified in Table 3 -1 of Sectio n 14 (Appendix 2) of the LDK378A220 5 protocol, overall 
lesion response can be derived for patients without measurable disease at baseline  as follows 
(Table 4 -1). 
Table 4-1 Overall lesion response at each assessment: patients with non -target 
disease only  
Non-target lesions  New Lesions  Overall lesion 
response  
CR No CR 
Non-CR/Non -PD1 No Non-CR/non -PD 
UNK  No UNK  
PD Yes or No  PD 
Any Yes PD 
1 In general, the non- CR/non -PD response for these patients is considered equivalent to an SD 
response in endpoint determination.  
Missing baseline tumor assessment  
As specified in Section 14 (Appendix 2) of the protocol, since the timing of PD cannot be 
determined for patients with missing baseline tumor assessment, these patients are censored in the PFS analysis at the start date of treatment. This rule, however, only applies to the ‘PD component’ of the PFS or DOR  asse ssment.   
Patients without baseline tumor assessment who die within D
[ADDRESS_1076639] percentage change from baseline in the sum of the measured diameter of all target lesions for each patient.  The proportions of patients with various degrees of tumor shrinkage or growth can then represent a useful efficacy metric.

16-Jan-2020 (11:03)   LDK378A2205 SAP Amendment 1.0  
 
CONFIDENTIAL - For Business Use Only  However, caution needs to be paid to the assessments, where an occurrence of a new lesion or 
worsening in non- target lesions (resulting in PD as an overall lesion response at gi ven 
assessment) contradicts the measurements obtained on target lesions.  These assessments will not be displayed as bars in the graph. If such a “contradicting” assessment represents the only post- baseline assessment for a patient, then the patient will b e represented by a special symbol 
(e.g. *) in the waterfall graph. 
The assessments with unknown target response and also assessments with unknown overall 
response will be excluded. Patients without any valid assessments will be completely excluded from the  graphs. 
The total number of patients displayed in the graph needs to be shown and this number will be used as a denominator when calculating the percentages of patients with tumor shrinkage and tumor growth.  Footnote will explain the reason for excluding some patients (due to absence of 
any valid assessment).  
All possible assessment scenarios are described in Table 4 -2. 
Table 4-2 Inclusion/exclusion of assessments used in waterfall graph

The following algorithm will be used to construct the graph: 
1. Select “valid” post- baseline assessments to be included, i.e. for each patient and each 
assessment repeat the following four steps: 
1.1. Check the target lesion response and overall lesion response at each assessment.  If at least 
one of them is UNK then exclude the whole assessment.  Otherwise, go to step 1.2. 
1.2. Check the overall lesion response.  If PD , then go to step 1.3. Otherwise, go to step 1.4 
1.3. Check target response.  If PD , then go to step 1.4.  Otherwise flag the assessment  . 
1.4. Calculate the % change from baseline in target lesions.  
2. For each patient, go through all valid assessments identified in step [ADDRESS_1076640] % change from baseline in target lesions.  The “best” means best for the patient, i.e. the largest shrinkage or if a  patient only has assessments with tumor growth 
take the assessment where the growth is minimal. ( Example 1 : Patient 1 has the following %

changes from baseline at assessments 1, 2 and 3, respectively: +5%; +18% and +35%. 
His/her best % change is then +5%.  
3. Construct the waterfall graph displaying the best % change from baseline for e ach patient. 
Patients having only   flagged assessment(s) will be displayed separately.  
The recommended way of the display from left to right is: 
1. Bars above the horizontal axis representing tumor growth  
2. Bars under the horizontal axis representing tumor shrinkage

4.6.2  Implementation of RANO guidelines (protocol Appendix 3)  
As described in the protocol, intracranial endpoints (OIRR, IDCR, DOIR, and TTIR in the brain) 
will also be evaluated by [CONTACT_782911]. This section provides some 
details on how to derive these intracranial endpoints by [CONTACT_782912] 3. 
RANO vs. RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_1076641] 1.1 and RANO include: 
• The measurability criteria for target lesion by [CONTACT_782913] 1.[ADDRESS_1076642] 1.1; 
• In RECIST 1.1, only one diameter is recorded for each target lesion, while in RANO, two perpendicular diameters are measured for each target lesion;  
• In RANO, corticosteroids use and clinical status are also considered for determining 
overall response; 
• There are two types of non -target lesions by [CONTACT_95733]: non-enhancing lesions and non-
measurable enhancing lesions. Both types of non-target lesions contribute to the non-target lesion response.

1. Target lesion measurements;  
2. Non-target lesion response;  
3. New lesion present (Yes/No);  
4. Corticosteroids use; 
5. Clinical status.  
All these components are collected on the following eCRF page s: 
1. RANO target lesion - Measurable enhancing lesion (T1) (ZI domain, ZICAT = 
”MODIFIED RANO CRITERIA FOR BRAIN METASTASES”, ZISCAT = ”TARGET ENHANCING T1”);  
2. RANO non -target lesion - Non -measurable enhancing lesion (T1) (ZI domain, ZICAT = 
”MODIFIED RANO CRITERIA FOR BRAIN METASTASES”, ZISCAT = ”NON -

3. RANO non -target lesion - Non -enhancing lesion (T2/FLAIR) (ZI domain, ZICAT =

4. RANO New Lesion (Z I domain, ZICAT = ”MODIFIED RANO CRITERIA FOR BRAIN

5. Corticosteroids use and c linical status  are collected on the Modified RANO Assessment 
(ZR domain, ZRCAT =  ”MODIFIED RANO CRITERIA FOR BRAIN METASTASES”, 
ZISCAT = ”RESPONSE AS SESSMENT”).  
Unlike in RECIST 1.1, each target lesion by [CONTACT_782917]. In order to calculate the target lesion response, the product of the two perpendicular diameters is calculated for each target lesion. Then the sum of the products of all target lesions is compared to the baseline or nadir to determine the target lesion response.  
The non- target lesion response is collected on the field of “Non- target lesion present” in the 
Modified RANO Assessment page, and is evaluated based on both non- target lesion eCRF 
pages as shown above. However, no derivation will be performed from individual non- target 
lesion status to non-target lesion response.  The RANO response/progression crit eria are summarized in Table [ADDRESS_1076643] response they can achieve 
is stable disease (SD) in the brain.

Two fields in the Modified RANO Assessment page will not be used for any data analysis in 
the study: “New enhancement outside radiation field?”, “Tumor present in histopathology”. 
As in RECIST 1.1, PD should only be assigned if it is demonstrated by [CONTACT_782918]. Discontinuation due to disease progression or death due to progressive disease, without supporting objective evidence, will not be considered as PD.  
As in RECIST 1.1, the same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to 
characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up. The details of 
change in imaging modality are described in Section 4.6.1. 
The same principle will be followed for determining missing adequate tumor assessments, as 
described in section 4.6.1.  
4.6.3  Sources for overall lesion  response  
The tumor endpoints derivation is based on the sequence of overall lesion responses at each 
assessment/time point. However, the overall lesion response at a given assessment/time point will be provided from different sources as illustrated in  Table 4 -4. 
Table 4-4 Sources for overall lesion response  
Source 1  Investigator (local radiology) reported overall lesion response 
(intracranial, extracran ial and whole body)  
Source 2 BIRC (Blinded Independent review committee) reported overall lesion 
response  (intracranial, extracranial and whole body)  
In this study, Source 1 will be used for the primary endpoint ORR, the key secondary endpoint DCR and other secondary endpoint calculations based on investigator assessment ( OIRR, IDCR, 
TTIR, DOIR, OERR, EDCR, TTER, DOER, DOR, TTR , and PFS).  Source 2 will be used to 
calculate OIRR, IDCR, TTIR, DOIR, OERR, EDCR, TTER, DOER, ORR, DCR, DOR, TTR,

CONFIDENTIAL - For Business Use Only  and PFS by [CONTACT_14988] . In addition, OIRR, TTIR, DOIR, and IDCR are also assessed according to 
RANO from both Source 1 and 2.  
4.6.4    Kaplan -Meier estimates  
To analyze time to  event variables ( DOIR, TTIR, DOER, TTER, DOR, TTR, OS and PFS) a n 
estimate of the surv ival function will be constructed using Kaplan- Meier (product -limit) 
method  as implemented in SAS PROC LIFETEST with METHOD=KM option (see example 
below). The TIME state ment will include a variable with survival times ( survtime  in the 
example below) and a (right) censoring variable ( censor  in the example below) with a value of 
1, representing censoring: 
PROC LIFETEST data = dataset   
METHOD = KM  
CONFTYPE=LOGLOG; 
TIME survtime* censor(1); 
RUN; 
/* survtime  represents variable containing event/censor times; 
censor represents censoring variable (1 = censored, 0 = event); */  
Kaplan -Meier survival and failure function estimates from this procedure will be used to 
construct the Kaplan -Meier figures . 
Median survival will be obtained along with 2- sided 95% CIs calculated from PROC 
LIFETEST output using the method of Brookmeyer & Crowley, 1982.  
Kaplan -Meier estimates with 2 -sided 95% CIs at specific time points will be summarized.  The 
time points can be expressed in weeks or in months depending on the time -to-event variable.  
The CIs will be constructed using Greenwood’s formula [Collet, 1994, p.23]  for the standard 
error of the Kaplan -Meier estimate.  
The PROC LIFETEST statement will use the option CONFTYPE=LOGLOG. The 
CONFTYPE option specifies the transformation applied to the survival function to obtain the point- wise confidence intervals and the confidence intervals for the quartiles of the survival 
times. The LOGLOG keyword specifies the complementary log- log transformation (Collett, 
1994; Lachin, 2000) g(x)=log( -log(x)) which ensures that the point -wise confidence intervals 
are always within interval [0,1]. Although the LOGLOG is the default option in SAS v 9.4, it should be explicitly shown. 
The Kaplan -Meier graphs will be constructed using SAS software.  
4.6.5  Confidence interval  for response rate s 
The estimate of the  response rates ( OIRR, IDCR, OERR,  EDCR  ORR , DCR ) will be 
summarized in terms of percentage rates with 95% CIs. An exact binomial confidence interval 
(implemented using SAS procedure FREQ with EXACT statement for one- way tables) will be 
calculated (Clopper and  Pearson,1934).  
SAS procedure FREQ will be used to estimate the proportion of responders (binary outcome = 1 or “Yes”), along with the  associated 95% (=100 × (1 – two-sided alpha level )) two-sided exact 
binomial CI. These estimates are obtained as follows : 
[COMPANY_001]  Confidential  Page 48

proc freq data = dataset;  table binary event /  
binomial( 
level = “Yes”) 
alpha = two-sided alpha level ; 
exact binomial; 
When there are no responders, SAS does not produce a CI by [CONTACT_15094]. To obtain a CI in this 
situation, PROC FREQ is used as specified above except changing level =”No” . From the results 
of this modified procedure, the values in percent of the LCL and UCL of a 0% response rate are calculated as follows:  
LCL
LEVEL=”Yes”  (%) = 100% - UCL LEVEL=”No”  (%) 
UCL LEVEL=”Yes”  (%) = 100% - LCL LEVEL=”No”  (%)

baseline value (laboratory, ECGs, vital signs, WHO  performance status), all post -baseline 
values will be included (scheduled, unscheduled, repeat). All unscheduled and repeat 
measurements will be included in listings.  
Laboratory  Data   
For laboratory data, assessments can  be collected from both local and central laboratory on the 
same date. For shift tables using CTC grades to compare baseline to the worst post -baseline 
value, the assessment with worst post -baseline value is used for analyses irrespective of the 
source. Fo r LFT summaries, where concurrent measurements are used in the calculation of 
number and percentage of patients with worst post -baseline values, the assessment with worst 
post- baseline value is used (since worst values are based on the largest ratio of lab  value to its 
ULN for each patient) although the worst values for the different parameters may be coming 
from different laboratories. 
ECGs  
For all patients, 3 ECGs are targeted to be measured at the protocol -defined (nominal) time-
points. If a patient has more than one measurement at a nominal time point, the average of all 
available measurements associated with the nominal time  point will be used for the analyses.   
4.7.[ADDRESS_1076645] available assessment before or on the date of start of study

ECGs   
Baseline for ECG measurement is the average of all available measurements (unscheduled, if 
applicable) taken prior to dosing on the date associated with the last available ECG measurement before or on the date of start of study treatment. To determine whether ECG measurement was taken prior to dosing, ECG time will be compared with dosing time, if available. Unscheduled assessments will be included in the calculation of the average if ECG time is before dosing time. Study day [ADDRESS_1076646]- dose measurement.  
For unscheduled assessments on study day 1, 
• if dosing time is non -missing, then the assessment is classified as post- baseline if ECG 
time is later than dosing time.  
• if dosing time is missing, the assessment is classified as post- baseline.  
The same ECG assessments will be used for both qualitative and quantit ative baseline 
evaluations. 
4.7.3  Laboratory Parameters 
This section provides further detail on the analysis of laboratory parameters that will be listed 
and summarized as described in Section 2.8.2.  
Hematology Hematolog ic tests include: Hemoglobin, platelets, white blood cells (WBC), red blood cells 
(RBC), differential (basophils, eosinophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, neutrophils (% or 
absolute) 
The following rules will be applied to derive the WBC differential counts when only 
percentages are available (this is mainly for neutrophils and lymphocytes, because CTC grading 
is based on the absolute counts).  
The method to convert the value is straightforward: for each patient , the original lab value (%) 
is divided by 100 and multiplied by [CONTACT_782919] e.g. for neutrophils (NEU): 
NEU count = (WBC count) * (NEU%value/100) 
In order to derive the corresponding absolute normal range,  the rule to be applied depends on 
the availability of the % range and the absolute range for the differential: 
• If % range missing and absolute range missing, then use pre -defined normal range 
reported in the [COMPANY_006] manual

range provided by [CONTACT_779] 
• If % range NOT miss ing and absolute range missing, then the % normal limits ( i.e. LLN 
and ULN) are divided by 100 and multiplied by [CONTACT_782920], e.g. for neutrophils NEU): 
LLN for NEU count = (LLN for WBC count)* (LLN for NEU%value /100) ULN for NEU count = (ULN for WBC count)*(ULN for NEU%value/100)

The following calculation will be applied for corrected calcium in SI unit: 
Corrected calcium (mmol/L)=measured total Ca (mmol/L)+0.02 (40 -serum albumin[g/L]), 
where 40 represents the average albumin level in g/L.

• All events with start date before or on the cut -off date, and with end date missing or 
after the cut -off date  or after the date of withdrawal of informed consent  will be reported 
as “continuing”.  
• This approach applies, in particular, to AEs and concomitant medication reports. For these 
events, the end date will not be imputed and therefore will not appear in the listings.  
If imputation of an end date is required for a specific analysis (e.g. for a dose administration 
record with missing end date or last date of study drug after the cut -off date), the end date will 
be imputed by [CONTACT_782921], cut-off date  and withdrawal of informed consent 
date for the purpose of calculating duration of exposure to study drug and dose intensity. The 
imputed date will be displayed and flagged in the listings. 
4.8.1  AE date i mputation  
Date imputation is the creation of a new, complete date from a partial one according to an a greed 
and acceptable algorithm.  Missing date for AE will be handled according to rules specified 
below. A partial date is simply an incomplete date e.g. DDOCT2001: the days are missing from 
this DDMMMYYYY date.  
Partial AE start dates, if left partial, would ultimately mean the following  
It would not be possible to place the AE in time. 
Therefore the treatment/dosage at the time of the event would be unknown. Therefore the event could not be reported/summarized appropriately – if at all.  
Therefore it is important to perform date imputation to ensure that as many data events are 
represented as correctly as possible. Of course partial and/or missing dates should also  be 
caught as edit checks and passed back to the in vestigator for resolution. 
There will be no  attempt to impute the following:

CONFIDENTIAL - For Business Use Only  4.8.4  Incomplete date for anti -neoplastic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_782852]:  
The same rule which is applied to the imputation of AE/concomitant medication start date 
will be used with the exception that for  scenario (B) will be replaced to be ‘start date of 
study drug - 1’. 
End date: 
Imputed date = min (start date of study drug, last day of the month), if day is missing; 
Imputed date = min (start date of study drug, 31DEC), if month and day are missing. If the end date is not missing and the imputed start date is after the end date, use the end 
date as the imputed start date.  
If both the start date and the end date are imputed and if the imputed start date is after the 
imputed end date, use the imputed end dat e as the imputation for the start date.  
Post therapi[INVESTIGATOR_782853] : 
Imputed date = max (last date of study drug + 1, first day of the month), if day is missing; 
Imputed date = max (last date of study drug + 1, 01JAN), if day and month are missing.  
End date: No imputation.  
4.8.5  Incomplete assessment dates for tumor assessment  
All investigation dates (e.g. X-ray, CT scan) must be completed with day, month and year. If one or more investigation dates are incomplete but other investigation dates are available, the 
incomplete date(s) are not considered for calculation of the assessment date and assessment date is calculated as the latest of all investigation dates (e.g. X -ray, CT -scan) if the overall lesion 
response at that assessment is CR/PR/SD/UNK. Otherwise, if o verall lesion response is PD, the 
assessment date is calculated as the earliest date of all investigation dates at that evaluation number.  If all measurement dates have no day recorded, the 1
st of the month is used.  
If the month is not completed, for any of the investigations, the respective assessment will be 
considered to be at the date which is exactly between the previous and the following assessment. 
If both a previous and following assessment s are not available, this assessment will not be used 
for any calculation s.  
In case of multiple imaging scans performed within an evaluation, if some imaging dates for tumor assessment under the same evaluation for a patient are before as well as after cut -off, the 
entire evaluation will not be included for analyses based on the pre-specified cut- off.

imputed) last contact [CONTACT_568] (excluding th e date of death) and the following: 
• Missing day:   1st day of the month and year of death 
• Missing day and month:    Jan 1st of the year of death

visit date, death date)  OR, 
    -- Year < Year of min (EOT date, death date) irrespective of the month  
    = min (EO T visit date, death date), for all other cases . 
The imputed date will be compared with start date of study drug.  
If the imputed date < start date of study drug, then last date of study drug is set to start date of study drug; 
 Otherwise, use the imputed date.  
4.8.8  Incomplete dates for disease progression prior to start of study drug 
If day of PD associated with prior antineoplastic medication is missing then imputed PD date: 
= min (midpoint between the end date of the prior antineoplastic medication and the end of the month, start date of LDK, start date of prior medication from the next regimen), if end date of prior antineoplastic medication is in the same month as the PD date,  
= min (15th of the month of the PD date, start date of LDK, start date of prior medication from the next regimen), if end date of prior antineoplastic medication is in a month prior to the PD date 
= 15th of the month of the PD date, if end date of prior antineoplastic medication is in a month after the PD date.

1. Introduction
IRB #: STU00200584 Approved by [CONTACT_24458] 5/20/2020 through 5/19/2021.
91.1 Background
Pressure  ulcers are defined by [CONTACT_574373] (NPUAP) as 
“localized injury to the skin and/or underlying  tissue usually over a bony prominence, as a result 
of pressure, or pressure in combination  with shear.”[1]  The epi[INVESTIGATOR_574331], with incidence rates ranging from  0.4% to 38% in 
acute care, 2.2% to 23.9% in long-term  care,  and 0% to 17% in home care. [2]  In US acute  care 
facilities alone, an estimated 2.5 million pressure ulcers are treated each year.[3]  Coupled with 
the high incidence of pressure ulcers in the US population are the staggering health care costs 
associated with their management.   The cost of managing  a single full-thickness pressure ulcer is 
as much as $70,[ADDRESS_753849] been  
estimated at $11 billion  per year.[4, 5] The recent decision in 2009 by [CONTACT_65682] 
& Medicaid  Services deeming  pressure  ulcers  reasonably preventable and halting additional  
reimbursement for the treatment of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]-acquired pressure ulcers, even if clinicians  deemed  
them unavoidable, has compounded  the fiscal burden associated  with pressure ulcer 
management.[6]   The development of pressure ulcers also carries significant legal repercussions. 
Pressure ulcers litigation against long-term  care providers has resulted in settlements favoring the 
plaintiffs in up  to 87% of cases.[7] 
The risk factors associated with increased risk of pressure  ulcer development are broad 
and include older age, black race,  lower  body weight, physical or cognitive impairment, poor 
nutritional status, incontinence, and specific  medical  comorbidities that affect  circulation such as 
diabetes or peripheral vascular disease. [8-12]   Pressure ulcers are often associated  with pain, can 
contribute to functional impairment  with delayed returns to function, can lead to complications 
such as infection,  and may significantly  prolong hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602].[13, 14]  In addition, the 
IRB #: STU00200584 Approved by [CONTACT_24458] 5/20/2020 through 5/19/2021.
10presence of pressure  ulcers themselves are associated with a poorer  overall prognosis  and may 
also contribute to mortality risk.[14]
The consequences of pressure ulcer  development and management highlight the value in 
devising novel,  efficacious, and cost-effective preventative and management strategies. 
1.2 Preventative  Therapy
Recommended prevention strategies  for pressure ulcers generally involve  use of risk 
assessment tools to identify people at higher risk for ulcer formation in conjunction with 
interventions designed to avert ulcer  formation. [15, 16]  A number  of instruments have  been 
developed to assess the risk of pressure ulcer development.  The three most  widely  used are the 
Braden scale, the Norton scale, and the Waterlow scale.[17-19]  Categories of preventative 
interventions include support surfaces such as mattresses and integrated  bed systems, 
repositioning, skin care,  and nutritional  support with each category encompassing a wide variety 
of diverse  interventions.[15, 16]  Prior trials have been limited in that none have evaluated  the 
effectiveness of preventative  interventions by [CONTACT_574374].  
Rather, the majority of trials have  been  conducted based on a priori risk assessments.  
Support surface  systems include  static  mattresses, overlays, or bed systems;  or alternating  
air mattresses, overlays,  and bed systems.  These  devices serve to redistribute pressure in order  to 
manage tissue loads, micro-climate,  and/or other  therapeutic functions.[20]  Results  of studies 
investigating these systems have been equivocal overall.  Five trials  have compared static 
mattresses or overlays with standard  operating  room mattresses with two trials  demonstrating 
increased risk and two trials demonstrating  decreased  risk.[21-25]  Similarly, two trials  have 
compared alternating support  surfaces  with static, usual care surfaces with no statistically 
IRB #: STU00200584 Approved by [CONTACT_24458] 5/20/2020 through 5/19/2021.
11significant differences in pressure  ulcer  incidence,  although results tended to favor alternating  
systems.[26, 27]  Additionally, a variety  of repositioning regimens  have been  studied including 
changes in body position every two hours[28, 29], repositioning at a 30 degree tilt[30], 
alternating semi-Fowler position (30 degree  elevation of the head and feet) and a lateral 
position[31], and repositioning based  on nurse clinical judgment.[32]  Results  were variable with 
only two trials demonstrating statistically  significant reductions  in risk with the initiation  of 
repositioning protocols.[28, 30]  All trials were  hampered by [CONTACT_574375].  
Strategies for nutritional  support include the supplementation of high-calorie  oral liquid  
nutritional supplements[33-36] or supplementation of high fat, low-carbohydrate enteral 
formulas via tube feeding [37, 38].  Five of the six trials investigating nutritional supplementation 
found no difference between nutritional supplementation compared with standard hospi[INVESTIGATOR_574332].   A single trial of [ADDRESS_753850] hospi[INVESTIGATOR_574333]  a critical illness.[33]  
Finally, the category of preventative  skin care products includes the application of 
creams, lotions, cleansers, dressings, and pads.  Studies of topi[INVESTIGATOR_142739], lotions,  and cleansers  
have primarily focused on commercially available  products.  Studies  of a hyperoxygenated fatty 
acid cream (Mepentol) [39] and Conotrane cream (benzalkonium chloride  [an antiseptic]  plus 
dimeticone [a silicone  fluid which repels water])[40] demonstrated  decreased risk of pressure 
ulcer development.  Moreover, a trial found use of Clinisan cleanser associated  with a lower risk 
IRB #: STU00200584 Approved by [CONTACT_24458] 5/20/2020 through 5/19/2021.
12of ulcer development compared to standard soap and water  in patients with incontinence. [41] In 
comparison, other commercial studies have  not demonstrated the advantages associated  with the 
addition of topi[INVESTIGATOR_12450].[42, 43]  Three  trials have evaluated dressings  or pads for the 
prevention of pressure ulcers with only one trial demonstrating  a statistically significant 
reduction in pressure ulcer  incidence. [44, 45]
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_574334],  it 
is readily  apparent that further research  is required and that currently  available products, despi[INVESTIGATOR_574335], are woefully inadequate at attenuating the risk of pressure  ulcer 
development.  Further  trials should employ a clearly  delineated protocol for the use of 
preventative interventions  based  on validated  risk-assessment scores.   More research is needed  to 
understand the effectiveness of preventative  interventions with adherence to stringent  
methodological standards including the appropriate use of blinding with clear descriptions of 
usual care.

promote healing  of the ulcer, and surgical repair of the ulcer.[46, 47]  Most ulcers are treated  
using a combination of these approaches.   The standard of care for pressure  ulcer treatment is 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_574336], such as those  developed by [CONTACT_574376], but are also

13informed by [CONTACT_4676]-related factors  such as comorbidities and nutritional status, local practice 
patterns, and the stage and  features  of the wound.[48]  
Support surfaces  and nutritional supplementation are unique in the management of 
pressure ulcers as they represent interventions  that address  the underlying  conditions  that give 
rise to pressure ulcers.  As such, these strategies  are utilized in both preventative  and therapeutic 
interventions.  Examples of support surfaces include low-air-loss, alternating pressure,  or air 
fluidized systems.  Air fluidized  beds are made  up of a lining mattress filled  with small beads; air 
is forced through to create a fluid-like surface  that redistributes pressure.  Five studies  have 
compared air fluidized beds to other support surfaces and have consistently reported a positive 
effect compared to alternatives in promoting the reduction in size of pressure ulcers.[49-53]  
Alternating pressure systems have  cells or sections that inflate and deflate to change the 
distribution of pressure.  When compared  against  air, fluid, or standard beds, alternating pressure 
beds have generally yielded similar results.[54-56]   Low-air-loss systems use power to provide a 
flow of air that helps regulate heat and humidity and may also adjust pressure.   Studies 
comparing low-air-loss beds to foam  surfaces showed similar wound improvement.[57-59]   
Signs of poor nutrition, such as low levels of prealbumin,  vitamin C, or zinc, are all 
associated with an increased  incidence of pressure  ulcers.[60, 61]  Studies have  identified that 
when used in addition to other measures for treating pressure ulcers,  protein-containing 
nutritional supplementation results in wound improvement.[62-65]   Two trials  have examined 
the effect  of micronutrient supplementation  with either zinc sulfate  or vitamin  C with insufficient 
evidence for either intervention.[63, 66]  As such, guidelines formulated by [CONTACT_521232],  
including the National  Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel and the European Pressure Ulcer Advisory 
IRB #: STU00200584 Approved by [CONTACT_24458] 5/20/2020 through 5/19/2021.
14Panel, include recommendations  for providing high-protein, mixed nutritional supplementation 
to all patients at risk for  pressure ulcer  development.[48]
Non-surgical  interventions targeted at protecting and promoting  ulcer  healing  include 
wound dressings,  topi[INVESTIGATOR_14929], and various adjunctive therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], such as negative 
pressure wound therapy and hyperbaric  oxygen therapy.  Wound  dressings represent  a 
cornerstone of pressure ulcer treatment  and serve  multiple functions, including padding and 
protection of the ulcer from pressure and friction,  the provision of a moist wound  environment 
and protection against  dessication,  serving  as a barrier in patients with incontinence or other  
sources of wound contamination, wound exudate  absorption, and promoting autolytic 
debridement of necrotic tissue and slough.   Studies have demonstrated that wound improvement 
is superior with hydrocolloid and foam dressings compared to gauze dressings.[67-73]  Current 
evidence is insufficient to advocate  the use of hydrogels, transparent  films, silicone,  and alginate  
dressings.[72, 74-78]   Topi[INVESTIGATOR_574337],  promote 
tissue debridement, and eliminate or prevent  infection.  Evidence regarding the effectiveness  of 
collagenase and other debriding enzymes is currently inconclusive  [79-81], while several studies 
have shown superior results compared  to placebo  with the application of platelet-derived growth 
factor in Stage  III and IV pressure  ulcers. [82-85]  Although topi[INVESTIGATOR_574338],  few studies  have compared antimicrobials  to 
placebos or other interventions and current evidence is insufficient to draw any conclusions  
regarding their effectiveness.[86,  87] 
Finally, for chronic pressure  ulcers  that have progressed to an advanced  stage and are 
unable to reliably  heal with conservative  measures, surgical  debridement and vascularized soft

15tissue reconstruction may serve to provide definitive  closure.  Surgical interventions range from 
local debridement of necrotic and nonviable tissue  in the wound  bed to direct closure, skin 
grafting, and closure with soft tissue flaps using either skin (cutaneous), fascia (fasciocutaneous),  
or muscle  (myocutaneous)  from  unaffected parts of the body.  Techniques  for wound closure 
depend on the location, size, and depth of the pressure ulcer as well as the specific  nature of the 
patient’s medical comorbidities and previous surgical interventions.[88]  Primary closure is 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_574339].[89]  Similarly, skin grafting is generally reserved for shallow nonhealing ulcers with a well-
vascularized wound bed and is rarely used due to the high risk of failure from mechanical 
shear.[89]  Current evidence is insufficient  to determine if one approach  to flap-based  closure  is 
superior to another due to overall poor study  quality,  study  population heterogeneity, and 
differences in surgical technique.[90-95]   In the face of a limited  evidence base, surgeons  
typi[INVESTIGATOR_574340].  Fasciocutaneous  flaps represent durable,  well-vascularized  flaps  that spare  the patient 
significant functional deformity and may provide good bony prominence  coverage,  but their 
limited bulk may prove insufficient  for large or deep wounds.[88]  Conversely, 
musculocutaneous flaps provide more depth  of coverage at the cost of functional deformity,  but 
are typi[INVESTIGATOR_574341] a superior local blood 
supply including improved tissue oxygenation,  antibiotic delivery, and enhanced lymphocytic 
function.[88]   The relatively recent development of perforator-based flaps have  gained  popularity  
since their introduction by [CONTACT_574377] 1993.[96]   Advantages of a perforator-
based flap includes preservation  of the blood supply and muscles  for possible future 
reconstructions.[97]  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_574342], 
IRB #: STU00200584 Approved by [CONTACT_24458] 5/20/2020 through 5/19/2021.
16significant debate surrounds the selection  of the optimal regional flap for the repair of pressure 
ulcers.[98-101]  Moreover, predictors  for the ultimate success of flap reconstruction are poorly 
delineated, but include bacterial  inoculation [102, 103], ulcer location[94, 104], nutritional 
status[105], postoperative  pressure relief[105, 106], length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_41836],[104] spi[INVESTIGATOR_105538][104], and presence of joint contractures.[105]  The predictive effect of bacterial 
inoculation requires  special attention.  Previous investigations  have demonstrated  up to 100-fold 
increases in bacterial  count in inoculated  wounds subjected to pressure  and have established a 
threshold of 105 organisms per gram of tissue as a significant predictor of flap failure.[102, 103, 
107, 108]  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_77078], the current  evidence base is woefully inadequate due to the 
preponderance of case series and experimental  animal models, necessitating  the development of 
a well-powered clinical  study  of the bacterial  microbiome in inoculated pressure ulcers  to 
develop mechanistic and predictive models for flap failure.  Recidivism rates due to pressure 
ulcer recurrence or flap failure is currently unacceptably high with overall rates  as high as 39 
percent.[109]   These rates are even  higher in spi[INVESTIGATOR_574343] a recurrence  rate of 
70 percent in one study.[95]  Given  these  high rates of recurrence  and the significant financial 
burden on the health care system associated with pressure ulcers, emphasis  must  be placed  on the 
proper selection  of patients for surgical  reconstruction and the need to develop improved  
prevention strategies. 
Current treatment strategies for pressure ulcers are guided by [CONTACT_574378], local 
practice patterns,  anecdotal evidence, and individualized decision making  based  on specific  
patient and wound factors.  Although there  is general agreement on the standards of care with 
respect to the types of treatment employed, evidence comparing  interventions within a given 
intervention strategy are sparse, limiting  the ability for clinicians to judiciously select  the optimal  
IRB #: STU00200584 Approved by [CONTACT_24458] 5/20/2020 through 5/19/2021.
17interventions for their patients.  Therefore, further studies should focus upon the comparative  
effectiveness of different management approaches.  
1.4 Description of Study  Products
Patients presenting for operative management of stage III or IV pressure ulcers will be 
assessed for study inclusion  using study inclusion and exclusion  criteria.  Consenting subjects 
will be randomized  to receive therapy with either  the treatment support surface (Dolphin Fluid 
Immersion Simulation® System)  or the control support  surface (Clinitron® Rite Hite® Air 
Fluidized Bed).  
The Dolphin Fluid Immersion Simulation® system represents a novel technology that 
was initially  developed  by [CONTACT_941] U.S. Navy in response to the need to transport specially trained 
marine mammals over long distances outside  of water.   The system  was designed in order to 
minimize the harsh  vertical shear  forces of gravity, which  ultimately  cause  internal organ  trauma 
and circulatory distress.  The Dolphin Fluid Immersion  Simulation® system  leverages an 
advanced 3D immersion technology in order to automatically simulate  a fluid environment, thus 
maintaining near normal blood  flow and optimizing tissue  oxygenation.  The system  is fully 
autonomous with monitoring  of the support surface over [ADDRESS_753852] bed and gurney  systems with 87% retention  of perfusion 
on the Dolphin Fluid Immersion  System® mattress  vs. 16% on standard mattresses.[110]  
Moreover, Sparrow Specialty  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], a 36-bed long term acute care hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], replaced a [ADDRESS_753853] myocutaneous flap protocol with an air-fluidized bed system with a 6 week protocol  using 
IRB #: STU00200584 Approved by [CONTACT_24458] 5/20/2020 through 5/19/2021.
18the Dolphin Fluid  Immersion Simulation® system based protocol.  After intervention, patients 
achieved equivalent flap outcomes with a $26,249  reduction in costs over the study time 
period.[111] 
Like other air-fluidized systems, the Clinitron® Rite Hite® air fluidized therapy  bed is 
made up of small beads with air forced through to create  a fluid-like surface that redistributes 
pressure.  Three  randomized clinical trials, have  specifically examined the Clinitron® system  to 
alternatives.  A study by [CONTACT_574379]. comparing an air-fluidized  system to an alternating 
pressure system  showed a statistically  significant decrease in total wound surface area and pain 
with a 5.6 relative  odds of improvement compared  to the alternating  pressure system over the 
median 13 day follow-up period. [50]  Furthermore,  Monro  and investigators compared  20 Dolphin Fluid Immersion Simulation® System
IRB #: STU00200584 Approved by [CONTACT_24458] 5/20/2020 through 5/19/2021.
19patients on air-fluidized beds to [ADDRESS_753854] hospi[INVESTIGATOR_574344]-fluidized bed and increased  on standardized beds over the course  of each 
patient’s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_41836].[53]  Finally, Jackson et al. compared [ADDRESS_753855] care support surfaces with statistically 
significant reductions in wound area.[51]  
Potential benefits touted  by [CONTACT_574380]®  System  include a 
completely automated autonomic  system with minimal required training as the system  requires  
no programming or manual  data input.  This is in contrast to the Clinitron® Rite Hite® Air 
Fluidized Therapy Bed, which requires various adjustments by [CONTACT_574381].  The Dolphin  
Fluid Immersion Simulation® System fits into existing  bed frames permitting potential Clinitron® Rite Hite®  Air Fluidized Therapy Bed

20integration across the clinical  care continuum and reducing the threshold for adoption of the 
therapeutic support surface.  Current  fluidization  technologies are affected by [CONTACT_574382], potentially requiring health care staff to employ 
a variety  of strategies such as lowering the room temperature, closing windows, and readjusting 
blankets on the unit that may negatively  impact  patient comfort while compromising health care 
resource utilization.   In addition, patient transfers into and out of air-fluidized beds is technically 
difficult, requiring two providers, and may present an obstacle to care in the home environment 
where adequate staffing may not be available.   Although Joerns makes no claims to the ease of 
patient transfers in the technical specifications of the Dolphin  Fluid Immersion Simulation®,  the 
facilitation of patient transfers  could  significantly  reduce staffing needs while facilitating care in 
an outpatient environment.   Finally, the previous study by [CONTACT_574383]. demonstrated significant  
benefits with respect to wound  healing and pain compared to conventional surfaces,  even with a 
repositioning regimen  of every 4 hours rather than every 2 hours in the conventional surface  
group.[50]  The Dolphin Fluid Immersion Simulation®  System claims to require no need  for 
caregiver or staff intervention  due to the continuous monitoring of the patient’s weight, three-

1.5 Study Rationale 
Although valuable, previous clinical studies investigating the Dolphin Fluid  Immersion 
Simulation® system have not adequately  compared  the system to other  standard  of care support 
surfaces.  Studies thus far have  been limited to observational investigations  of tissue perfusion 
and post-intervention  investigations without an active comparator group.  Furthermore, previous 
trials comparing  air-fluidized  beds to other systems have been limited by [CONTACT_574384].[50, 51, 53]  Thus, the proposed study is designed to examine the 
potential benefits of the Dolphin Fluid Immersion Simulation®  system following operative  
closure of pressure ulcers compared to a representative  air-fluidized system,  the Clinitron® Rite Clinitron® Rite Hite® Air  Fluidized Therapy Bed Input System
IRB #: STU00200584 Approved by [CONTACT_24458] 5/20/2020 through 5/19/2021.
22Hite® air-fluidized therapy bed.  Currently, there is a paucity of data for clinicians  to advocate 
for the usage  of novel fluid  immersion simulation systems  compared to current standard  of care 
support surfaces.  The effects of the Dolphin Fluid Immersion Simulation®  system will be 
studied and compared to the Clinitron® Rite Hite® air-fluidized therapy  bed in a controlled  
manner after surgical closure of subjects’ wounds.  
2. Study  Objectives
The primary objective is to compare  the effects of the Dolphin Fluid Immersion 
Simulation® System to an air-fluidized  system after definitive operative  closure of pressure 
ulcers.  This post-market, on-label  study will evaluate the effectiveness of the Dolphin Fluid 
Immersion Simulation® System when  compared  to a standard of care support system.

243. Study  Design
3.1. Overview
This protocol outlines a prospective,  randomized, single-center,  human subject  trial 
comparing the Dolphin Fluid Immersion  Simulation® system  to a representative  air-fluidized 
support system, the Clinitron® Rite Hite®  air-fluidized therapy bed.  Following operative 
debridement, patients will be randomized  to receive therapy with either the Dolphin  Fluid 
Immersion Simulation®  system  (treatment)  or the Clinitron®  Rite Hite® air-fluidized therapy  
bed (control).   Subjects will receive assigned  study therapy following definitive  pressure ulcer  
closure and extending two weeks  beyond  closure, reflecting current standard  practice for 
pressure ulcer management.  Investigators  will follow,  evaluate, and make clinical decisions 
regarding wound  therapy, further  debridement, or readiness for closure.  The primary endpoint 
will not be followed  during this period.  Data regarding secondary  endpoints  other than the tissue 
biopsies delineated in Section  2.1.[ADDRESS_753856] of care for pressure  ulcer management as 
delineated by [CONTACT_574385].[48]  The two week  study  period will begin following the definitive 
surgical procedure  for pressure  ulcer  closure, at which time data regarding the primary  endpoint 
and the secondary  endpoints laid out in Section 2.1.2 will be  collected.   
The determination of a wound’s appropriateness for definitive closure is currently  viewed 
as a clinically  subjective event.   Readiness  for closure is established when the Investigator deems 
that the wound has been  adequately debrided, cleaned, and a definitive procedure can be 
performed. 
IRB #: STU00200584 Approved by [CONTACT_24458] 5/20/2020 through 5/19/2021.
25The treatment period for Dolphin Fluid Immersion Simulation®  system  Treatment  
therapy or Clinitron®  Rite Hite®  air-fluidized  therapy  bed Control therapy will begin following 
the closure  visit and will continue  until two weeks following the definitive operative procedure.   
Both support surfaces  will only be used in the inpatient setting.   Subjects will remain 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_574345].  After  two 
weeks of inpatient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], Control or Treatment therapy may be continued although the 
only endpoint that will continue  to be measured will be the incidence  of additional 
complications, need for additional surgeries, or need  for other therapeutic interventions.   
Subjects will continue to be followed  for one year after the two week study period in 
order to evaluate the incidence  of complications  and the need  for additional therapeutic 
interventions.  Assessments  will include monthly telephone  interviews.  
An interim analysis of the Intent-to-Treat  (ITT)  population will be performed when [ADDRESS_753857]  satisfied the ITT criteria (see Section 7.4).  An Independent Data  
Monitoring Committee  (IDMC) comprised  of a biostatistician and clinicians  will convene to 
review the data from  the interim analysis  and evaluate the assumptions for the original  sample  
size calculation.  The IDMC will determine if the sample  size will be adjusted  based upon results 
from the interim  analysis.

274. Selection of Subjects
4.1. Recruitment  and Screening
Patients who present  to the investigator’s institution (through clinic admission, direct  
transfer from another facility, or through the emergency room) and are, or will be, admitted as an 
inpatient for operative management of a stage  III or IV pressure  ulcer may be recruited  to 
participate in the study.   Additionally, direct  marketing for subject recruitment will be performed 
by [CONTACT_574386]. Robert Galiano’s  Rehabilitation Institute  of Chicago patients and via 
television, radio, and online advertisements.  
Patients approached for study participation  will be at least [ADDRESS_753858] influence the treatment plan or the 
relationship with the  physician.  
There is no cap on the number  of subjects that can be screened.  Additional subjects  will 
continue to be recruited as needed to reach the minimum number of 100 treated per protocol, per 
arm.  
IRB #: STU00200584 Approved by [CONTACT_24458] 5/20/2020 through 5/19/2021.
284.1.1. Subject Stipend 
No reimbursement or compensation will be provided  for participation  in this study.  Costs related 
to the treatment and control arms, including the support surfaces and staff training, will be 
covered by [CONTACT_16049].  
4.1.2. Wound  Selection
Potential subjects  who consent  to study participation will be assigned  a unique screening 
number.  Only one wound per subject  will be included in the study.  Subjects with multiple 
wounds will have each wound measured for volume.  The wound  with the largest volume  
meeting all pre-operative  eligibility requirements will be chosen for inclusion in the study.  The 
location of the wound, and if it is a new or recurring wound, will be documented.  Only stage III 
or IV pressure ulcers will be eligible for inclusion in this  study.  
At the conclusion  of the initial surgical debridement, if all inclusion  and no exclusion 
criteria continue to be met, the subject  will be randomized into a study group and assigned a 
unique Randomization number.   If the subject does not continue to meet all inclusion and no 
exclusion criteria  at the end of surgical  debridement, they will not be randomized and will be 
documented as a screen  failure.  The  reason  for exclusion will be noted on the Screening Log.  
At the time of surgical closure,  if all inclusion and exclusion criteria continue to be met, 
the Randomization number will become a unique Subject ID number.  If the subject does not 
continue to meet all inclusion and no exclusion criteria number prior to and up to the point of 
operative closure, they will be documented as a randomization failure.   The reason  for exclusion 
will be noted on the  Randomization log.  
IRB #: STU00200584 Approved by [CONTACT_24458] 5/20/2020 through 5/19/2021.

5.1. Informed  Consent
IRB #: STU00200584 Approved by [CONTACT_24458] 5/20/2020 through 5/19/2021.
30The Investigator  will discuss the purpose of this clinical investigation with potential 
subjects.  Each potential subject will review  the IRB approved Informed  Consent Form (ICF).  
The subject  and the Investigator (or designated medically licensed sub-investigator), must  sign 
and date the ICF before the subject  can undergo  any clinical investigation-related procedures.  
The subject’s informed consent will be obtained under these conditions:
Subjects must be made aware of the purpose  of the clinical investigation and the potential 
risks and benefits  known or  that can  be reasonably predicted or expected
Subjects must  be given the opportunity to ask the Investigator questions  and must be 
provided time  to consider participation in the  clinical investigation
ICFs will be written in language that is non-technical and  understandable  to the subject 
Subjects will not be led to believe that they are waiving their legal rights  to release the 
Investigator, Joerns®, Clinitron®, the Institution, or any of their agents from liability  or 
negligence
Subjects will be asked to sign and date the ICF indicating their informed consent to be 
enrolled in the clinical  investigation
The Investigator’s responsibilities during the  ICF process include:
a.Screening  out potential  subjects  who may not be able or willing  to comply  with 
the clinical investigation protocol
b.Ensuring that subjects have signed the ICF prior to undergoing any clinical 
investigation related  procedure
c.Ensuring that  subjects  are provided a copy of the  signed ICF
5.2. Screening
IRB #: STU00200584 Approved by [CONTACT_24458] 5/20/2020 through 5/19/2021.
31Patients who are scheduled for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_574346] a pressure  
ulcer or multiple  pressure ulcers  will be identified, consented, and screened  for the study 
according to Section 4.  Potential subjects presenting with multiple pressure ulcers  requiring  
debridement will have each wound assessed pre-operatively.  The largest  pressure ulcer meeting  
eligibility requirements listed in Section [ADDRESS_753860] is considered a screen failure,  they will 
keep the screening  number assigned to them and the screen failure log will be completed  noting 
the reason(s) for  screen  failure.  
Screened subjects consenting to participate in the study will not have screening 
laboratory tests collected. However, prior laboratory testing  results will be documented, 
including WBC with differential,  HgbA1c,  glucose, BUN, Creatinine,  Total Protein, Albumin, 
and Pre-Albumin.   A focused medical  and surgical  history, physical  exam, and wound history  
will be conducted and recorded.  The subject’s  current  medications  will be  documented. 
5.3. Randomization
Subjects will be taken to the operating room for the initial debridement procedure of their 
wound.  At the end of the procedure,  Subjects who continue to meet all inclusion and no 
IRB #: STU00200584 Approved by [CONTACT_24458] 5/20/2020 through 5/19/2021.
32exclusion criteria will be randomized in a 1:1 ration to be treated  with either  the Dolphin Fluid  
Immersion Simulation® System or the Clinitron® Rite Hite®  Air-fluidized bed.  Since there 
may be differences in pressure ulcer  types, a stratified randomization will be used for this study  
to prevent  imbalance between treatment  arms.  Permuted blocks will be used to achieve equal 
number of Subjects assigned to the Dolphin Fluid Immersion Simulation® System or the 
Clinitron® Rite Hite® Air-fluidized bed to generate a randomization schedule including Subject 
numbers and treatment  assignments.  Envelopes will be prepared corresponding  to each row in 
the randomization schedule and each Subject number and treatment group will be printed  on 
labels.  
Prior to study initiation,  sealed pre-numbered randomization  envelopes  will be provided  
to the research staff and will be used to obtain a randomization assignment.   Opening of the 
randomization envelope  will occur  intra-operatively at the conclusion of the initial surgical 
debridement of the wound and confirmation that all inclusion and no exclusion criteria  were 
encountered.  Study  staff will use the Randomization Number  labels contained in the envelope.   
This number  will become the Subject ID for patients who undergo operative closure.  The 
assignment will be:
Subject is randomized  to Dolphin Fluid Immersion Simulation®  System  (Treatment arm)
Subject is randomized  to Clinitron®  Rite Hite®Air-fluidized bed (Control arm)
The research  staff will note treatment assignments and instruct the investigator.  Control or 
Treatment therapy support surfaces  will be initiated  following  operative closure, according to the 
manufacturer’s recommendations.  
IRB #: STU00200584 Approved by [CONTACT_24458] 5/20/2020 through 5/19/2021.
33In order  to ensure  consistent study treatment,  subjects will receive  assigned Control or 
Treatment therapy within their study arm after  the wound  is deemed ready for closure  or 
coverage by [CONTACT_737].   
Support surface therapy crossover prior to and during the study treatment period is not 
permitted.  Subjects randomized to the Dolphin Fluid Immersion  Simulation®  System  Treatment 
arm are the only subjects that will receive  this therapy  at any time during the study period.   If 
Dolphin Fluid Immersion  Simulation® System is discontinued, subjects in the treatment arm will 
transition to an institutional standardized support surface.  Subjects randomized  to the Clinitron® 
Rite Hite® Air-fluidized bed will receive  only this therapy prior  to and during  the study 
treatment period.   
If the assigned Control or Treatment  therapy  must  be discontinued prior to deeming the 
wound ready for closure or coverage,  subjects will transition  to a standard  institutional  support 
surface.  These  subjects will remain  in the study and continue to be followed but will not be 
included in the  per protocol analysis  group.  
5.4. Initial OR Debridement of Wound
Prior to start of the initial  debridement  procedure in the operating  room, the wound  will 
be assessed  and the results documented.  A pre-debridement digital  photograph of the wound 
will be taken.  Prior to the surgical  prep,  a pre-debridement wound swab will be obtained for 
aerobic and anaerobic culture  and a pre-debridement  wound  scrapi[INVESTIGATOR_574347]. 
The wound  will then be debrided.  At the conclusion of the debridement,  the wound will 
be irrigated with at 5L of normal saline  unless contraindicated  in the judgment  of the

34Investigator.  Antibiotic  solutions are permitted  for irrigation based on the judgment of the 
Investigator and standard of care practices.  
If the wound is determined  to be ready for immediate closure, the closure  procedure  can 
be performed.  Closure at the time of the initial surgical debridement  will be considered as the 
initiation of  the study period.  
If all inclusion  criteria and no exclusion  criteria are met at the end of the surgical 
procedure, the subject will be randomized  according  to Section 5.2.  After randomization,  a post-
debridement wound  assessment will be performed and documented.  A post-debridement  digital 
photograph of the wound will be taken.  A post-debridement wound swab  will be obtained for 
aerobic and anaerobic culture  and a post-debridement  wound scrapi[INVESTIGATOR_574348].  
5.5. Wound Care Prior to Closure
During the subject’s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063], interventions other  than the support surface 
utilized will be based on institutional standard  of care practices.  These include wound dressings, 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_14929], and the use of adjunctive therapi[INVESTIGATOR_574349]-assisted closure  and 
hyperbaric oxygen therapy.   The  type of dressing used will be  documented.  
5.6. Additional OR Wound  Debridement 
The Investigator will determine if additional  surgical debridement is required after the 
Initial OR Visit. This decision is typi[INVESTIGATOR_574350]-
debridement culture results.  To ensure consistent treatment, subjects returning to the operating

35room for additional  debridement of their wound should  resume their assigned  study therapy after 
the procedure unless contraindicated in the judgment of the Investigator. 
Prior to the start of the debridement procedure, the wound will be assessed and the results  
documented.  The wound  will be debrided  according to the discretion  of the Investigator.  At the 
conclusion of the debridement the wound will be irrigated with at 5L of normal  saline unless 
contraindicated.  After wound irrigation, a post-debridement assessment will be performed and 
documented.  Wound  swabs  will be taken  both prior to and following all additional  debridement 
procedures. Tissue scrapi[INVESTIGATOR_574351].
5.7. Wound Closure or Coverage  
When the Investigator determines that the wound  is ready for closure or coverage, the 
study period  will be initiated.   A wound  swab  will be obtained for aerobic and anaerobic  culture  
and a wound  scrapi[INVESTIGATOR_574352], a wound  assessment  will be 
performed, and the date of closure  determination will be documented.     Definitive wound  
closure for this study is defined as complete approximation  of the wound  edges, complete 
coverage of the wound via tissue transfer  or skin graft, or any combination of these definitive  
techniques that results in complete elimination  of the wound  bed.  Debridement may be 
performed prior  to surgical closure  or coverage.  All operative procedures including any 
debridement must  be documented.  The use of a cutaneous, fasciocutaneous, myocutaneous, or 
perforator-based flap will be documented.   The amount  of tension and the potential dead  space 
remaining following closure will be documented by [CONTACT_574388].  The 
adequacy of these assessments will be assessed by a blinded  surgeon reviewer.  If a flap fails 
during the immediate postoperative period, the subject will be removed from  the study  and 
IRB #: STU00200584 Approved by [CONTACT_24458] 5/20/2020 through 5/19/2021.
36transitioned to a standard institutional support surface.  These  studies will continue to be 
followed, but  will not be  included in the per  protocol analysis group. 
5.8. Two Week Study Period
Subjects will be followed for two weeks  following primary closure for the primary 
endpoint of wound dehiscences and flap complications.  Data regarding cost of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_574353].   Nurses caring for patients during  this time 
period will receive surveys in order  to assess the ease of use and acceptability of the Control or 
Treatment Arms.   Patients will receive a survey after one week  and two weeks in order  to 
evaluate their comfort and  acceptability  of the  Control or Treatment Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
5.9. Follow-Up After  Two Week Study  Period
Subjects may be discharged  from inpatient care when deemed appropriate  by [CONTACT_574389].  Monthly  phone interviews will be conducted 
in order to assess  for additional wound complications or necessary  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_574354].  
6. Study  Assessments/Measurement  Tools
6.1. Quantitative PCR Analysis
Specimens  will be collected through tissue scrapi[INVESTIGATOR_574355], after each additional debridement and when the wound is deemed ready 
for closure.  The samples will be analyzed for bacterial speciation and quantification through  
PCR techniques.   Samples will be sent to the PathoGenius Laboratory® for measurements of the 
IRB #: STU00200584 Approved by [CONTACT_24458] 5/20/2020 through 5/19/2021.
37tissue microbiome.  Additionally, PCR assays  for inflammatory  markers  will be conducted on 
the samples by [CONTACT_100615]’s  lab.  
6.2. Qualitative Aerobic and Anaerobic  Cultures
Culture specimens will be collected  through swab  cultures at the deepest  point in the 
wound before and after the initial debridement, before and after each additional  debridement, and 
when the wound is deemed ready for closure, according to current techniques.   Culture swabs 
will be placed in an appropriate transport media  and sent to the institutional  laboratory  for 
qualitative aerobic and anerobic  analysis.  Due to the turn-around-time of qPCR results,  only the 
qualitative aerobic and anaerobic culture results  will be used as the indicator  of wound  infection 
post debridement for the  purposes of guiding treatment.  
6.3. Quantitative Protein  Analysis
Specimens will be collected through tissue scrapi[INVESTIGATOR_574355], after each additional debridement, when the wound is deemed ready for 
closure, and two weeks following closure.  Protein-based assays  of inflammatory markers  will be 
conducted on  the samples.
6.4. Laboratory  Tests
Laboratory testing will not be performed  for the study. If available, results of the 
following laboratory tests will be collected  from  the subject’s medical history and/or from  
standard of care testing that is required  per institutional standards.  The Investigator will 
determine if abnormal test results  are clinically significant.  All clinically  significant laboratory 
results will be  recorded as AEs.

6.5. Clinical Wound Assessments
Wound  assessments are performed  by [CONTACT_574390].  Wounds  will be measured to determine the volume.  Wound volume  will be 
recorded in cubic  centimeters by [CONTACT_574391], width, and depth using  a 
ruler.  Wound length  will be measured along  the surface of the body in the longest dimension of 
the wound.  Width will be determined  from the widest  point of the wound that is perpendicular to 
the length in the same plane of measurement.   Depth will be measured from  the surface of the 
skin to the deepest part of the wound bed perpendicular  to the plane of measurement for the 
length and width.  
Wound characteristics  and appearance will be recorded using the following scale:
Wound Depth 1 = Blanchable erythema on intact  skin
2 = Partial thickness skin loss involving  
epi[INVESTIGATOR_135092]/or dermis
3 = Full thickness  skin  loss involving damage 
or necrosis of subcutaneous tissue; may extend 
down to but not through underlying fascia; and 
or mixed  partial and full  thickness and or tissue 
layers obscured by [CONTACT_574392]
4 = Obscured by [CONTACT_372329]

7. Statistical Design
The primary objective is to measure  and compare the effects of the Dolphin  Fluid 
Immersion Simulation® System to air-fluidized  beds in pressure ulcers undergoing operative 
closure.  
Clinical  outcomes of interest  for this study are defined as the incidence of wound  related 
dehiscences or flap complications within the two weeks following surgical closure of the 
pressure ulcer; the number of operating room debridements required after initial debridement  to 
when the wound  is deemed appropriate  for closure  or coverage; the difference  in bacterial count 
from the time of the initial debridement  to subsequent debridements and the time of operative 
closure; costs incurred during the two week  period following surgical  closure; and nurse  and 
patient acceptability of the Treatment  and Control arms. These outcomes will be analyzed  and 
compared between  the Dolphin Fluid Immersion Simulation® System and the Clinitron® Rite 
Hite® Air-fluidized bed. 
7.1. Statistical Methods  Planned
Unless specified otherwise, SPSS® Version 22  or higher will be utilized to  perform  the 
statistical analyses of efficacy and safety  measures.   
Categorical variables will be summarized in general using frequencies and percentages,  
whereas continuous variables will be summarized  in general using descriptive statistics of 
IRB #: STU00200584 Approved by [CONTACT_24458] 5/20/2020 through 5/19/2021.
44number of observations (n), mean,  standard  deviation (SD), minimum  (Min), median,  and 
maximum (Max).   
Hypothesis testing, unless otherwise indicated,  will be performed  at the 5% significance 
level.  All p-values  will be rounded  to four decimal places; p-values  less than 0.0001 will be 
presented as ‘<0.0001’  in all tables.   All group comparisons from analysis of variance (ANOVA) 
and/or analysis  of covariance (ANCOVA) models  will be based on Type III sums of squares.  
All confidence  intervals will be two-sided  with 95% coverage. 
7.2. Determination of Sample Size
An adaptive  design will be employed to monitor the study to determine the target number 
of subjects required  to achieve significance at the alpha = 0.05 level. 
A previous  systematic review of complications following flap based  surgery  for pressure 
ulcers demonstrated  a mean complication rate of 19.6% with a standard  deviation of 
approximately 3% following the usage of perforator based flaps.[106]  We have determined that 
a difference in proportion of responders  of at least 10% would be regarded as clinically 
meaningful. 
Assuming  a 10% delta  in proportion between support surfaces and a “confirmed” 
complication rate of approximately 20% with a standard deviation  of 5%, a sample size of 98 per 
group will provide a  statistical power  of 80% at the significance level of 0.05 (2-sided).  
Therefore, a total of 200 subjects randomized with an equal allocation ratio (1:1) of the 
Treatment arm versus Control arm will be  needed in the present study.  
IRB #: STU00200584 Approved by [CONTACT_24458] 5/20/2020 through 5/19/2021.
457.3. Interim Analysis
The study  data will be evaluated when  approximately [ADDRESS_753862] completed the  study.  Data from the interim  analysis  will be used to verify the assumptions 
for sample  size calculation  or to re-estimate  the sample size  as well as to  confirm the safety of  
the study.  The interim analysis will be based  off of the available data for the ITT population. 
To ensure  data integrity and unbiased clinical decisions, the planned  interim  analysis will 
be conducted under the auspi[INVESTIGATOR_574357]  (IDMC) 
assigned to this study.   The IDMC will disseminate  interim results in a manner that will protect 
the scientific and ethical  aspects  of the study.  The IDMC will review the study data at interim 
analysis to re-estimate the final target sample size using 80% power for the primary endpoint of 
number of wound  dehiscences or flap complications following operative closure using the 
approach described  by [CONTACT_33336].[112]  
7.4. Analysis Populations
The following Subject  populations  will be considered for this  clinical study:
Per-Protocol Population (PP):  All subjects  who are randomized and received either 
Control or Treatment therapy for two weeks  after wound closure, completed  the 
protocol’s required  evaluations, and did not have any major protocol deviations.   The 
primary and secondary effectiveness  analyses for this study will be based  on this 
population.

7.5. Safety Analyses
Safety analyses will be carried  out using  the Safety population to allow a benefit/risk 
assessment within the  same study population.  
All AEs recorded during  the course of the study  will be coded according to the MedDRA 
(version 13.0) classification system.  An event will be considered as treatment  emergent if the 
time of onset is on or after the initial debridement  through  Day 74.  Any event with an onsent on 
IRB #: STU00200584 Approved by [CONTACT_24458] 5/20/2020 through 5/19/2021.
52the day of initial operative  debridement where the time of onset is missing will be assumed  to be 
treatment emergent. 
Number and percentage of treated subjects  who experienced at least one adverse  event in 
each system  organ  class  by [CONTACT_574402]-serious 
adverse events.   Summary tables will be provided of incidences for all treatment emergent  
adverse events,  treatment-related adverse events, adverse  events  by [CONTACT_63301], serious 
adverse events,  and adverse events  that led to study discontinuation.  In any given category (e.g. 
system organ class  or preferred term)  a subject will be counted only once.   If a subject has the 
same adverse event on multiple occasions, only the one with maximum severity will be 
presented.  The denominator  for the calculation  of percentages will be the number of subjects in 
the sub-arm of subjects being tabulated and not the number of events. 
7.6 Handling of Missing and Incomplete  Data
There will be no imputations made  to accommodate missing data.  All data recorded will 
be included in  data listings.    
8. Study  Discontinuation  and Withdrawal of Study Subjects
8.1. Premature Discontinuation  of the  Study
If the clinical  investigation is terminated prematurely or suspended, the IRB will be 
informed promptly and provided with the reason(s) for the termination or suspension  by [CONTACT_574403].  If applicable, regulatory  authorities and the personal 
physicians of the  subjects will be informed by [CONTACT_15327].   
8.1.1 By  [CONTACT_2728] (Joerns)
IRB #: STU00200584 Approved by [CONTACT_24458] 5/20/2020 through 5/19/2021.
53Joerns reserves  the right to discontinue  any clinical investigation for business  or ethical  reasons 
at any time, such as but not limited to:
The clinical investigation is not conducted in accordance with  the approved  protocol
Information on the investigational  product causes  doubt  as to the benefit/risk ratio
Changes in medical practice  limit  utility of the  data obtained from the study
Incidence  or severity of AEs indicates a potential health hazard or poses  an unreasonable 
risk to the study participants
8.1.2 By  [CONTACT_574404]: 
Clinical investigation is not conducted in accordance with the IRB’s  requirements
Clinical investigation is associated with unexpected serious harm  to subjects
8.2. Premature Discontinuation  of the  Subject
Subjects may withdraw from  the study at any time at their own request, or they may be 
withdrawn at any time at the discretion  of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_263144], behavioral, or administrative reasons.  
If a subject does not respond to study telephone surveys, every  effort should be made  to contact 
[CONTACT_423], per institutional protocol. 
In any circumstance, every effort should be made to document subject outcome.  The 
Investigator should inquire about the reason for withdrawal and follow  up with the subject 
regarding any unresolved AEs.  Any related SAE occurring within [ADDRESS_753863]  be reported to Joerns®  and be  followed up until stabilization  or resolution.   
IRB #: STU00200584 Approved by [CONTACT_24458] 5/20/2020 through 5/19/2021.
54If the subject withdraws from the study, and also withdraws consent for disclosure of 
future information, no further study evaluations  will be performed, and no additional  data will be 
collected.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_574358].

inform the subject accordingly.  
9. Potential Risks of Study Participation
9.1. Potential  Risks Associated with the Investigational Product
All risks known or anticipated  based on prior experience, risk analysis or reasonable  
grounds are listed in each product’s  Instructions  for Use.  This protocol document will be 
IRB #: STU00200584 Approved by [CONTACT_24458] 5/20/2020 through 5/19/2021.
55updated in the presence of new information of relevance to the safety of the subject  or the 
conduct of  the study.   
10. Monitoring for Safety
The Investigator will perform safety  monitoring in the following manner.  AEs will be 
captured at each study visit during treatment  regardless of causality or severity.  All SAEs will 
be followed by  [CONTACT_574405]/stabilization.
10.1. Adverse  Events
The intent of Joerns is to protect the safety of all subjects enrolled in this clinical 
investigation.  Broadly defined an AE is any undesirable clinical  occurrence in a subject.  AEs 
will be 100%  source-verified by [CONTACT_574406]. 
The intensity of an AE will be classified as one of the following:
Definition of Intensity of Adverse  Events
Intensity Definition
Mild Transient, does  not interfere with Subject’s  daily activities, does not require 
special treatment
Moderate Interferes with  Subject’s daily activities,  requires  simple therapeutic  measures
Severe Intolerable experiences,  interruption of Subject’s daily activities,  requires  
substantial therapy including medical or surgical intervention or  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_574359].   The relationship of an 
AE to the  device, comparator,  or surgical incision will be  categorized  as one  of the  following:
Relationship of Adverse Events to the Device
Relationship Definition
IRB #: STU00200584 Approved by [CONTACT_24458] 5/20/2020 through 5/19/2021.
56Not Related No relationship which  makes a causal relationship incontrovertible (i.e. not  
related to the device)
Related Definite temporal association  exists, clinical  experience  makes the relationship 
definite and certain
10.2. Serious Adverse  Events
A SAE is  an AE that  meets one or more  of the following criteria:
fatal
life-threatening
results in an  unanticipated or prolonged  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]
results in a  significant and persistent disability/incapacity
10.3. Anticipated Events
Anticipated  AEs for this study  include but are not limited to periwound  skin maceration,  
wound recurrence after definitive closure,  hematoma,  seroma, and surgical site infection.   These  
events may result in therapeutic interventions, including surgical  drainage, surgical incision  
packing, debridement, and reoperation.  Although anticipated, these occurrences are considered 
AEs and should be  documented appropriately.
10.4. Investigator  Reporting Requirements
The Investigator has the primary  responsibility for safety of subjects under his or her 
care.  In this function,  he/she should  routinely monitor each subject  for the occurrence  of any 
AE.  For every AE that occurs, the causal relationship will be determined.   If the device, 
comparator, or study treatment relatedness  is found, then a full description of the event should be 
recorded including the data of onset, time course, severity, action taken regarding the study 
treatment, outcome, and any treatment  applied.  
IRB #: STU00200584 Approved by [CONTACT_24458] 5/20/2020 through 5/19/2021.
57The Investigator should list the specific diagnosis, disease, or syndrome rather than 
associated signs and symptoms.  However, if the Investigator does not consider an observed or 
reported sign or symptom  a component of a specific disease  or syndrome, it should be recorded  
as a separate  AE.  Clinical syndromes associated with the findings of laboratory  abnormalities  
are to be recorded appropriately (e.g. bacterial  infection of the surgical incision instead of 
increase in bacterial load) as AEs.  
10.5. Device Malfunction
Device  malfunction means the failure of a device to meet  its performance specifications  
or otherwise perform as intended.  Performance  specifications include  all claims made in the 
labelling for the device.   The intended  performance of a device  refers to the intended use for 
which the device  is labelled or marketed. 
Device  malfunction may or may not result in the subject experiencing harmful  effect.  All 
adverse device effects  (ADEs)/unanticipated adverse device  effects (UADEs) associated with a 
device failure are by [CONTACT_574407].   Device  malfunctions  that are not related to an 
adverse event will  be reported to Joerns within [ADDRESS_753865] withdrawal due to an AE should be distinguished from  withdrawal due to other 
reasons by [CONTACT_574408].  
10.7. Follow-up of Subjects with Adverse Events
IRB #: STU00200584 Approved by [CONTACT_24458] 5/20/2020 through 5/19/2021.
58For subjects  who are experiencing  ongoing unresolved adverse events at the time of their 
study completion or early  discontinuation from the study, the Investigator should schedule one or 
more follow-up visits  as appropriate to follow the subject until the adverse event is resolved,  or 
determined to  be chronic.  
11. Quality Control and Quality Assurance

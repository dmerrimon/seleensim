1. STUDY  OVERVIEW  
 
Title Exploring  Immune  Effects  of Oral Insulin  in Relatives  at Risk for 
Type  1 Diabetes  Mellitus  
IND Sponsor  National  Institute  of Diabetes  and Digestive  and Kidney  Diseases  
(NIDDK)  
Conducted  By [CONTACT_39764]  1 Diabetes  Trial Network (TrialNet)  
Protocol  Chair  Peter Gottlieb, M.D.;  Barbara  Davis Center,  Denver, CO  
Accrual  Objective  A minimum  of 40 participants  will be enrolled  for this study.  
Study  Design  The study  is a 2-arm, multicenter , randomized, open -labelled  
clinical  research study.  
Treatment Description  Each  participant  will receive  recombinant  human  oral insulin 
capsules  either  through a daily regimen ( 67.5 mg/day) or biweekly 
regimen (i.e. every  other  week , starting at 135 mg titrating up to 500 
mg as tolerated ). 
Study  Duration  Participants  are enrolled  and followed  for a total duration  of [ADDRESS_308866] dose versus baseline.  
Major  Inclusion  Criteria  (1) Relatives  of T1D proband  with mIAA and at least one other  
diabetes -related  autoantibody confirmed  present  
Major  Exclusion  Criteria  (1)  Diagnosis  of diabetes  
 
 
2. BACKGROUND  AND  SIGNIFICANCE  
 
2.1. Rationale  for Study  
 
2.1.1.  Type 1 diabetes (T1D)  
Type 1 diabetes  mellitus  is an immune -mediated disease  in which  insulin -producing  beta cells are 
completely  or nearly  completely  destroyed,  resulting  in life-long dependence on exogenous  insulin.   It 
is a chronic  and potentially  disabling  disease  that represents  a major  public  health  and clinical 
concern.  The number  of patients  being  diagnosed with type 1 diabetes  is increasing  each  year and is  
Page  7 of 37  
TrialNet  Protocol  TN20  Protocol  Version:  15Jan2016   
 
approaching  an epi[INVESTIGATOR_253855]  (1).  Unfortunately,  the 
increase  in type [ADDRESS_308867]  in children  under  age five years  (2). 
 
Current  management  of T1D is not optimal.  To avoid  long-term complications,  patients  must  attempt  
to maintain  near normal  glycemic  control  by [CONTACT_253876], by 
[CONTACT_253877],  and by [CONTACT_253878].  Such  strict  glycemic control  is rarely  achieved  with current  management  and 
overly  aggressive therapy  results  in severe  hypoglycemia  which  can be life threatening  (3). It is not 
possible  to fully mimic  the function  of the beta cell, and there are no established  treatments  that can 
prevent  its destruction.  Thus,  despi[INVESTIGATOR_253856],  individuals  with 
diabetes  remain  at risk for early  mortality  and a high rate of morbidity  due to complications  such  as 
retinopathy  leading  to blindness,  neuropathy  and vascular  disease leading  to amputations  and heart  
disease,  and nephropathy  leading  to renal  failure.  The costs  of caring  for diabetes  and its 
complications  are currently  greater than $100  billion  a year (4). 
 
2.1.2.  Natural History of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1D)  
Much  is known  about  the natural  history  of the type 1 diabetes  disease  process  (5). Although all 
people  are susceptible,  relatives  of individuals  with T1D are at much greater  risk for development  of 
the disease.  In the general  population,  approximately  0.3%  of individuals  will develop  T1D.  In 
contrast, those  with a close  relative  with T1D have a 5% incidence  of disease  – a 15 fold increase  (6). 
Further  risk stratification  among family  members  depends  upon  genetic,  immune  and metabolic  data 
(7). 
 
Beta cell destruction  generally  begins  in genetically  susceptible individuals  years  before clinical  onset  
of disease (8). The autoimmune process  that causes  beta cell destruction  is clinically  silent  and can 
only be identified  by [CONTACT_253879]: Islet Cell Antibodies  (ICA),  
anti-glutamic  acid decarboxylase (GAD)65ab,  anti-ICA512ab/anti -IA2ab,  anti-insulin  autoantibodies  
(mIAA) (6), and the recently  described  antibodies  to a zinc transporter  (ZnT8)  (9). Continued  immune  
mediated beta cell destructi on involving  both B- and T-cells occurs  until physiologic  insulin  demand  
cannot  be met by [CONTACT_253880],  resulting  in hyperglycemia and clinical diagnosis  of T1D 
(10, 11). 
 
Based  on data from the Diabetes  Prevention Trial-Type  1 Diabetes  (DPT -1), the TrialNet  Natural  
History/Pathway  to Prevention  Study,  and others,  the risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_253857]  
(12- 14). Like the DPT-1, the ongoing  TrialNet  Natural  History/Pathway  to Prevention  Study  has 
tested more  than 150,[ADDRESS_308868] decade  or so. 
 
Approximately  5% of relatives  tested  are found  to have at least one autoantibody.  Further  testing  
enables  risk assessment  of this population.  In DPT-1, relatives  with at least  two autoantibodies  and 
normal  glucose  tolerance  have at least a 42% risk for development  of T1D over 6 years.  This was 
demonstrated  in DPT-1 as well as ENDIT  (European Nicotinamide Diabetes  Intervention  Trial),  a 
large European trial enrolling  autoantibody -positive  relatives  (15). This risk has been  confirmed in the 
ongoing TrialNet  Natural  History/Pathway  to Prevention  Study  (Figure  1).

Figure  1: Cumulative  incidence of type [ADDRESS_308869]  to Prevention Study  
participants  with > [ADDRESS_308870].  
 
 
Moreover,  while  the limited  numbers  of relatives  followed for more  than 10 years  prevent  precision 
around  a 10-year risk estimate,  it is noteworthy  that available  data from those in DPT-1 or TrialNet  
Natural  History/Pathway  to Prevention Study  suggests  no leveling  off of this risk over time.  Data 
from studies  following  individuals  at risk from birth also demonstrate  the continued  risk for T1D over 
time once  they develop multiple  autoantibodies  (Figure  2). 
 
 
 
Figure  2: Risk for development  of T1D in antibody  positive children  followed  from birth (16). 
 
Thus  our current  understanding  is that essentially  all relatives  confirmed  to have two or more  
autoantibodies  will eventually  develop clinical  T1D.

TrialNet  Protocol  TN20  Protocol  Version:  15Jan2016   
 
 
Prior  to this clinical  diagnosis,  autoantibody -positive  relatives  progress  from normal  glucose tolerance  
to impaired  or indeterminate glucose  tolerance  (defined  as any blood glucose  level after ingestion  of 
oral glucose  of > 200 mg/dL and/or  a glucose  level 2 hours  after ingestion  of oral glucose of 140-199 
mg/dL  and/or  fasting  glucose  between 110 – 125 mg/dL  during  a standard oral glucose  tolerance 
test).  Participant s in the TN01 Natural  History/Pathway  to Prevention  Study  with multiple  autoantibody  
positivity  and normal  glucose  tolerance  at baseline were  found  to have  a 38% two-year risk of 
progression  to confirmed  abnormal  glucose  tolerance  (Figure  3). Once  such  abnormal  glucose 
tolerance  is present, there  is a very high short -term risk  of clinical  diagnosis:  68% over 4 years (Figure  
4). The risk is particularly  high for individuals  under  the age of 18 (Figure  5). The extremely  high risk 
of this group  has now been demonstrated in three  independent  studies:  DPT-1, ENDIT  and the 
ongoing TrialNet  Natural  History/Pathway  to Prevention  Study.  
 
 
 
Figure  3: Two-year risk of confirmed abnormal  glucose tolerance is 38%,  and the six-year risk is 67.9%  among  
individuals  with multiple  autoantibody  positivity  and normal  glucose tolerance  at baseline in the TN01 Natural

2.1.3.  Oral Insulin for prevention of T1D  
The DPT-[ADDRESS_308871].  However,  a hypothesis -generating  analysis  of a subgroup  with high insulin  autoantibody  (IAA) 
levels  (defined  as ≥80 nU/ml  confirmed  on two occasions)  showed significant  benefit:  annualized  
diabetes  rate was 6.2%  during  treatment  with oral insulin  and 10.4%  with placebo  (P = 0.015)  and 
median  progression  to diabetes  was delayed by 4.5 years.  
 
Subsequent  to the DPT-1, a newer  assay  measuring  insulin  antibodies  was developed which  is more  
sensitive  and specific  for type 1 diabetes.  This is the micro  IAA assay  (mIAA).  Employing  this new 
assay,  Diabetes  TrialNet  is currently  testing  the hypothesis  that 7.[ADDRESS_308872]  on development  of type 1 diabetes  in autoantibody -positive  relatives  treated with 
nasal  insulin  at 4-8 mg intranasal  insulin  per day, INIT II investigators  in Australia/New  Zealand  
continue  to study  nasal  insulin  in a similar  population  using  a different  dosing  regimen  (16 mg 
Page  12 of 37  
TrialNet  Protocol  TN20  Protocol  Version:  15Jan2016  
 
intranasal  insulin  for 7 consecutive  days,  then once per week),  which  they have previously  
demonstrated to have a favorable immune  effect  (17). While  it is difficult  to extrapolate  antigen 
dosing in animal  models  to humans,  it has been noted  the dose of 7.5 mg oral insulin  daily chosen for 
the DPT-1 and TrialNet  trials is about  10 fold lower  than a dose shown to be effective in the NOD  
mouse pre-clinical  model.  Additionally,  modelling  has suggested that intermittent  dosing  would be 
more  likely  to induce T regulatory  cells to control  the immune  response (18). Recently,  Bonifacio et al 
explored  different  doses  in a clinical setting.   The Pre-POINT  study  evaluated different  doses  of oral 
insulin  in genetically  at-risk children  (mean age 5 years).  Using  immunologic  read-outs,  these  data 
indicated  no untoward effects  of treatment  and demonstrated that the highest  dose  (67.5  mg daily)  
was most  effective  in favorably  altering  the immune  response (19). As such,  these  investigators  are 
pursuing  the POINT  study,  using  67.[ADDRESS_308873] been mooted on the basis  of 
nonclinical  studies, there are several  that emerge  as rational  candidates.  
 
2.2.1.  Regulatory T cells (Tregs)  
Several  nonclinical  studies  have identified  the induction of T cells in response  to oral antigen  that are 
associated  with, and can adoptively  transfer,  protection  from autoimmune  disease  (20-21). These  
cells are typi[INVESTIGATOR_253858] -specific,  CD4+  and secrete the immune  suppressive cytokines  IL-[ADDRESS_308874] occasionally  been termed  TH3 (20, 22-23) cells and are generically  termed  
regulatory  T cells or Tregs.  When  induced against  autoantigens  such  as insulin,  these cells and the 
associated  cytokine  secretion  may also result  in by[CONTACT_253881]  T cells responding  
to autoantigens  other  than insulin,  as well as “infectious”  tolerance  whereby  [CONTACT_30962]  T cells with 
specificity  for non-insulin  autoantigens  may arise  (24- 28). Oral immunotherapy  has been used 
successfully to treat food allergy.  When low doses  are used  and escalated  every  two weeks,  a rise in 
the number  of antigen- specific  Tregs  is detectable over time.  Moreover,  those individuals  without  
clinical  response  had no change in antigen- specific  Tregs,  strongly  supporting  the concept  that 
induction of these  cells is an important  mechanism for the action  of oral tolerance.  These  reports  also 
noted  that the function  of antigen- specific  Tregs  increased over time with therapy,  in relation  to the 
methylation state  of FOXP3.  In summary,  advances  in our understanding  of Treg biology  and the 
manipulation of related  regulatory  pathways  provide a critical  underpi[INVESTIGATOR_253859].  
 
 
2.2.2.  Deletion of effector T cells  
Another mechanism,  demonstrated in animal  models,  by [CONTACT_253882],  anergy,  or death,  of antigen- specific  effector  T cells,  through  a process  termed activation  
induced  cell death  (AICD).  This mechanism  has also been identified  to be operative in humans,  
whereby  [CONTACT_253883]  a rapid clinical benefit  
Page  13 of 37  
TrialNet  Protocol  TN20  Protocol  Version:  15Jan2016  
 
(anergy  to allergens),  associated  with anergic  and exhausted antigen- specific  T cells (29). Although 
theoretically,  high doses  of antigen  could lead to Treg death,  this was not seen.  Recent  advances  in 
the identification  of antigen -specific  effector  T cells (e.g. using  peptide- HLA multimers  combined with 
multi -dimensional  flow cytometry)  has enabled  the development  of approaches  that can explore  
effects  of chronic  antigen  administration  on these  inflammatory  mediators,  including  their expression  
of markers  of chronic  stimulation  (30), as potential  biomarkers  in the context  of this protocol.  
 
2.2.3.  Sequestration of effector T cells  
It has been  further  suggested  that the use of the oral route  for antigen  administration leads  to 
sequestration of antigen- specific  effector  T cells within  the extensive  gut immune  system  (31). This is 
consistent  with the known effect  of antigen  in determining  T cell migration,  and would theoretically  
lead to a loss of relevant  effector  cells from the site of pancreatic  islet inflammation,  with concomitant  
therapeutic  effect  that is  sustained for the duration  of the therapy.  
 
In summary,  the T cell field has matured  sufficiently  to allow  rational  hypotheses  as to the mechanistic  
effects  of oral insulin  to be proposed and examined experimentally.  
 
 
2.3. Rational for Mechanistic  Assays  
 
2.3.1.  Detection of autoreactive T cells and induction of T regulatory cells  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].     Autoreactive CD4 T cells 
Assays to detect  antigen -specific  autoreactive  T cells in T1D have been developed,  replicated  and 
validated  in recent  years.  Modifying the standard proliferation  assay  to incorporate  selection  of 
CD45RO  memory  cells has identified  disease -associated  responses  in T1D.  Staining  for intracellular  
cytokine  production  and the ELISPOT  assay  which  measures  extracellular  cytokine  production after 
antigen stimulation  has been shown to detect  CD4 T cell responses  to insulin  IA-2, GAD  and ZnT8  
antigens  (32-33). The ELISPOT  system  allows  for quantitative  (number  of spots/well  = frequency)  
and qualitative  (differential  cytokine  response  – IFN-g, IL-10, IL-17) analysis  of the response to islet 
cell autoantigens  (34). Measuring  CD4 T cells using  these  types  of assays  will be important  in 
determining  if oral insulin  can lower  the number  of antigen -specific  autoreactive  T cells present  in the 
periphery  of individuals  given  study  drug vs. those  on control  or modify  the nature  of the response 
based  on the cytokine  profile  detected.  
 
 
[IP_ADDRESS].     Autoreactive CD8 T cells  
CD8 T cells are known to be critical  to disease development  in both the NOD mouse  and human  T1D.  
Although ELISPOT  assays assessing  their function similar  to what has been described for CD4 T 
cells have  been  developed (35-36), they have not been  replicated  or validated in their current  format.  
Enumeration  of CD8 T cells by [CONTACT_253884],  clinical  
research  studies  and islet transplantation protocols  and has been validated  in several  workshops  (37- 
39). The quantam  dot or Qdot  system  relies  on the use of two Qdot  chromophores  for a particular  
reactivity which  appears  to increase  the specificity  and ability  to detect very  low frequency  CD8 T cells 
more  reliably  than previously  described  approaches.  The ability  to multiplex  these  reagents  also has 
reduced  the amount  of cells needed for these analyses  and, lastly,  it can be done  on frozen  samples.  
An array  of class  I HLA-specific  islet cell peptide reagents  has been  designed  to assess  antigen 
reactivity to a number  of islet antigen  targets  and will be used  to measure the number  of CD8 T cells 
present  prior to and after oral insulin  therapy.  Again,  this and other  methodologies  using  tetramers  
should  help us to understand the mechanism  of oral antigen  therapy  in changing  insulin -reactive  CD8 
T cells,  as well as if it can affect  by[CONTACT_253885]-insulin -specific  CD8 T cell number  through by[CONTACT_253886].

[IP_ADDRESS].     T regulatory cells  
As discussed  previously,  oral insulin  in NOD  mice  can induce T regulatory  cells as one potential  
mechanism  of its action.  Detection of CD4+CD25+  Tregs  can be done via flow cytometry,  utilizing  the 
combination  of CD4,  CD25,  CD127  and FOXP3  to enumerate  the number of these  cells present  in the 
periphery  of participant s in the trial (40). Studies  in new onset  T1D have allowed  us to better  understand  
the potential  dysfunction  that may be occurring  in this regulatory  cell population,  which  may contribute 
to disease  onset  (41- 43). Bonifacio  and colleagues  recently  reported on their work using a higher  
dose of oral antigen  in genetically  at-risk first degree  relatives  of T1D participant s (19). They  showed 
that higher  doses  of oral insulin  could be associated with changes  in autoantibody  as well as T cell 
responses  to oral insulin,  suggestive  of a mechanism  for protection.  The assay  employed in their 
study  took peripheral  blood monocytes  (PBMC’s),  stimulated  them  with insulin  or proinsulin  and then 
isolated  the activated  T cells and examined their transcription profiles.  They  found that insulin - or 
proinsulin -specific  T cells from treated  participant s had increased  expression  of FOXP3  regulatory  
cells,  increased expression  of IL-[ADDRESS_308875]  of oral 
insulin  as a vaccine  inducing  active  immune  protection  in these  young  children.  Our study  will utilize  
these types  of assays to assess  the frequency  of T regs and to examine  their antigen- specific  
transcription profiles  to try to confirm and  extend these intriguing  observations from the Pre-POINT  study.  
 
3. STUDY  DESIGN  
 
3.1. Overview  
This is a 2-arm, multicenter,  randomized,  open- labelled clinical research study.  Participants  will receive  
varying  doses  and schedules  of recombinant  human insulin  in capsules  (referred  to hereafter  as oral 
insulin).  In this design,  each participant  is randomly  assigned  to 1 of 2 treatment  regimens  with 
equal  probability.  The primary  outcome  is the change  in immunologic  parameters  before and after 
treatment.  
 
3.2. Objectives  
The key questions that this mechanistic  study  will address are:  
 
1. Does  treatment  with oral insulin  affect  underlying  immunological  mechanism(s)  that are 
observed  through  changes  in immune  markers? 
2. Are there  differential  changes  in immunological  biomarkers  between different  schedules  of oral 
insulin?  
 
In terms  of a specific  set of hypotheses  that can be tested  using  samples  from these component  
studies, we aim to examine the following:  
 
We hypothesize that introduction  of oral insulin  in treatment -naïve participants:  
• removes  from the circulation insulin -specific  pro-inflammatory  T cells,  detectable  and 
recognizable by [CONTACT_253887]-γ and IL-17 
• removes  from the circulation  or modifies  the effector  functions  of insulin -specific  CD8 T cells 
recognizable  by [CONTACT_253888] -HLA multimers  or other  
similar  assays 
• induces  changes  in gene  expression  of insulin -specific,  proliferating  T cells that indicate a 
change  in balance of inflammation  and regulation 
Page  15 of 37  
TrialNet  Protocol  TN20  Protocol  Version:  15Jan2016  
 
 
 
• changes  peripheral  blood  gene signatures  (total  cell populations,  cell subsets,  cells activated  
ex vivo) to indicate induction  of immune  regulation 
 
All enrolled  participant s (relatives  of probands  with type [ADDRESS_308876] 2 autoantibodies)  
have established  islet autoimmunity,  a condition  which  generally  leads  to clinically  overt  type 1 
diabetes  over time.  In addition  to the mechanistic  hypotheses  described above,  all participant s will 
be closely  followed for progression of disease,  as oral insulin  may delay  or prevent  such  progression.  
 
 
3.3. Summary  of Inclusion/Exclusion  Criteria  
Participants  must meet  all entry  criteria  for the protocol  as outlined  below.  
 
3.3.1.  Inclusion Criteria

3.4. Study  Population  
Recruitment  and initial screening  to identify  participant s will be done  through  the TrialNet  TN01 
Natural  History/Pathway  to Prevention  Protocol.  As part of this protocol  and TN01,  participant s will 
then undergo additional  testing,  and if eligible  and willing,  will be randomized and followed  as 
described.  Participant s determined  during  screening  to be ineligible or unwilling  to be randomized 
to this protocol  will be offered  follow -up under  the Natural  History/Pathway  to Prevention Protocol.  
 
3.5. Description  of Treatment  Groups 
This protocol  will enroll  at least 40 participants  who will be randomly  assigned to the following  groups:  
o 20 participants  will be assigned to receive Oral Insulin  daily (67.5 mg) 
o 20 participants  will be assigned to receive Oral Insulin every other week  (starting at 135 
mg and titrating up to 500  mg every  other  week  as tolerated ) 
 
Figure  7. Proposed study  schema to examine changes  in immunologic  biomarkers  in treatment -naïve and 
treatment  –responsive  participants  following  introduction of oral insulin  as daily or every other week dosing.   
 
 
 
3.6. Treatment  Assignment  
After  participants  sign the consent  form,  complete  the screening  visit(s),  meet  all of the inclusion  
criteria,  and none  of the exclusion criteria,  and complete the baseline  procedures,  they will be 
randomized to receive one of two dose  schedules  of oral insulin.  Participants  will be randomized  in 
equal  allocations  to each  group.  The randomization method  will also be stratified  by [CONTACT_253889].  
 
Page  17 of 37  
TrialNet  Protocol  TN20  Protocol  Version:  15Jan2016  
 
3.7. Study  Assessments  
The intervention  protocol  will be conducted  at TrialNet  Centers  and Affiliates.  During  the course  of the 
study,  participants  will frequently  undergo  assessments  of their insulin  production , immunologic  
status,  and overall  health and well-being  (see Appendix  A, Schedule of Assessments).  All blood and 
serum samples  for outcome determinations  will be sent to the TrialNet Core  Laboratories  for analysis.  
 
The primary  outcome is the change in immunologic  biomarkers  before and after treatment.  Additional  
outcomes  include  safety  measures  and disease progression assessed  by [CONTACT_253890].  
 
During  the course  of the study,  samples  will be drawn  for storage at the National  Institute  for Diabetes  
and Digestive  and Kidney  Disease  (NIDDK)  Repository  and at TrialNet  Sites  for future  analysis.  
Participants  who decline  consent  for these  sample  collections  will not be eligible  to participate  in this 
study  (see Section  10.4).  
 
3.8. Quality  Assurance  
During  the study,  duplicate collections  of blood  samples  for assays  may be obtained  in a small  
sample  of participants  for the purpose  of external  quality  surveillance  of the performance of the 
central  laboratories.  
 
3.9. Study  Timeline 
Participants are  enrolled  and followed for a total duration  of [ADDRESS_308881]  not developed T1D at the conclusion  of the study  will return  to the TN01  Natural  
History/Pathway  to Prevention  Study.  They  may be eligible  for future  TrialNet  prevention  studies.  
This will be determined  when future  studies  are developed.  
 
Participants  who develop  T1D while  enrolled  in the TN20  Immune  Effects  of Oral Insulin  Study  will be 
offered  follow -up in the TN16 Long  Term  Investigative  Follow -Up in TrialNet (LIFT)  Study.  
 
4. PARTICIPANT  MANAGEMENT  
 
4.1. Screening  Visit and Eligibility  Assessment  
Participants  potentially  eligible  for this study  will be identified through  the TrialNet  TN01 study.  They  
will be notified  of their eligibility  by [CONTACT_253891].  The participant  will be 
asked to sign an informed  consent  document  describing  the purpose,  risks,  and benefits  of this study.  
Assent  will be obtained  for children.  A participant’s  signature [CONTACT_253919]/she understands  the 
potential  risks and benefits  of study  participation.  
 
The initial  testing  for mIAA  and other  autoantibodies  will be done  as part of TN01  screening.  Those 
individuals  who are mIAA  positive  will then be eligible  for additional  tests  as part of TN01  Monitoring  
visit or this protocol  as applicable.  
 
4.2. Randomization 
All eligible  study  participants  will be randomized  to one of two treatment  arms,  once eligibility  has 
been confirmed.  Randomization to each  of the two arms  will be in a 1:1 manner  (i.e. equal  allocation 
to the treatment  arms).  To prevent  potential  confounding,  randomization  will be stratified  by [CONTACT_253892].  After  randomization,  study  medication will be dispensed  to the participant  per the dose 
and schedule of the arm to which  they were  randomized.  
Page  18 of 37  
TrialNet  Protocol  TN20  Protocol  Version:  15Jan2016  
 
 
4.3. Drug  Administration 
Participants  will then take study  drug according  to the treatment  arm in which they are assigned.  Those 
assigned to daily oral insulin will receive  67.5 mg per day . Those assigned to every other week oral 
insulin will receive 135 mg for the initial dose, 250 mg for the second dose, and 500 mg every other 
week thereafter  as tolerated . Participant s will be observed at the study site for 2 hours after dosing visit s 
V0(A), V0(B),  and V1. Participant s will be contact[CONTACT_6811] a minimum  of every  other  week while  on treatment  
to facilitate compliance.  
 
4.4. Treatment Modification or Discontinuation  
Participants who have a screening glucose value < 50 mg/dl will not be randomized in the study. 
Participants who have pre -dosing glucose values < 50 mg/dl will not receive oral i nsulin.  If this occurs on 
visit 0  (A) such that the participant will have never taken oral insulin, the participant  will be withdrawn from 
the study.  If this occurs  on subsequent dosing visits,  the participant  will not receive any further study 
medication. They will continue with study visits  per protocol (Appendix A) .  
 
Participants who have post -dosing mild, prolonged, or severe hypoglycemia as defined in section 6.1.5 
will not receive further study medication.  They will continue with study visits  per protocol (Appendix A) . 
Participants  may also be discontinued  from treatment due to adverse  effects  of treatment that are ≥ 
Grade [ADDRESS_308882] possibly  related to the study  medication.  
These participant s will continue with study visits per protocol (Appendix A). Participants  who revoke their 
consent  to be treated will  also be discontinued from treatment.  These participant s will also continue to 
be monitored through study visits per protocol unless they withd raw consent for further follow -up.  
 Participants with acute upper  GI illness , or symptoms needing medications described in exclusion criteria 
[ADDRESS_308883] study team for advice on when to resume study drug.  
 
Participants  will not be discontinued  from evaluation and follow -up on th is study due  to non-compliance.  
 
5. STUDY  VISIT ASSESSMENTS  
See Appendix  A for detailed  schedule of assessments.  
 
5.1. General  Assessments  
General  assessments  for this Protocol  will include:  
o Informed  consent  
o Inclusion/exclusion criteria  
o Medical  history  
o Physical  examination  including height/weight  
o Concomitant  medications  
o Adverse  events  
o Pregnancy  test (if female of reproductive  potential)

5.2. Mechanistic  Outcome  Assessments  
Mechanistic  assessments  will consist  of studies  such as: 
o DNA  for testing  diabetes  or other immune -associated  genetic  markers.  
o RNA for the evaluation of immune cell frequency and function by [CONTACT_253893]  
o Peripheral  Blood Mononuclear  Cells  (PBMCs)  for the evaluation  of immune  cell function,  
especially  antigen- specific  responses  relevant  to the hypothesis  that oral insulin  can induce  a 
state  of tolerance to islet proteins.

o Serum  and plasma for the evaluation  of islet autoantibody  epi[INVESTIGATOR_9230],  affinity,  isotypi[INVESTIGATOR_253861] -based assessment of immune  responses.  
o CBC with Differential  
 
 
5.3. Metabolic  Outcome  Assessments 
Metabolic  assessments  will consist  of: 
o Baseline  OGTT  (i.e. within  52 days of initiation  of treatment),  as well as OGTTs  at the 6 month 
and 12 month  visits.  Glucose,  insulin,  C-peptide,  and other  analytes  will be measured  from 
OGTT  samples.  
o Glucose, insulin, and C -peptide will be measured before the study drug dose,  and at 1 and 2 
hours after dosing during study visits  V0(A), V0(B), V1.  
o HbA1c  
5.4. Visit  Windows  
Initial  treatment  administration (Visit 0(A) ) should begin  within  7 weeks , (no more  than 52 days)  
from the OGTT. For Visit 0(B) and Visit 1, the window is +/- 3 days of the target  date. For  Visit 2 
through Visit  7, the window  is +/- 7 days of the target  date.  Visit 8 should be within  +/- [ADDRESS_308884]  adverse  events  on source  documents,  regardless  
of the severity  or perceived attribution  to the study  medication.  The investigator  should  treat 
participants  with adverse events  appropriately  and observe them  at suitable intervals  until the events  
resolve or  stabilize.  
 
Adverse  events  may be discovered  through:  
o observation  of the participant;  
o questioning  the participant;  
o unsolicited  complaint by  [CONTACT_2299].  
 
Questioning of the participant  should  be conducted  in an objective manner.  
 
6.1.2.  Adverse Reaction 
An adverse reaction means any adverse event caused by a drug.  Adverse  reactions are a subset of all 
suspected adverse events for which there is reason to conclude that the drug caused the event. 
Suspected adverse reaction means any adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility that 
the drug caused the adverse ev ent. For the purposes of safety reporting, “reasonable possibility”  means 
there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the adverse event. A suspected 
adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than an adverse reaction, which 
means any adverse event caused by a drug.  Examples of evidence that suggest a causal relationship 
(reasonable possibility) between the drug and the adverse event include:   
• A single  occurrence of an event that  is uncommon and known  to be strongly associated with drug 
Page  20 of 37  
TrialNet  Protocol  TN20  Protocol  Version:  15Jan2016  
 
exposure  
• One or more  occurrences  of an event that is not commonly  associated  with drug exposure,  but is 
otherwise  uncommon in the populations  exposed to the drug  
• An aggregate analysis  of specific  events  observed in clinical research  (such  as known  
consequences  of the underlying disease  or condition under  investigation or other  events  that 
commonly  occur  in the study  population independent  of drug therapy)  that indicates  those events  
occur  more frequently  in the drug treatment  group than in a concurrent  or historical  control  group.  
 
6.1.3.  Serious Adverse Event/Reaction 
A serious  adverse  event  (SAE)  or reaction  is defined  as “any adverse event  occurring  at any  dose  that 
suggests  a significant  hazard, contraindication,  side effect,  or precaution.”   An adverse  event  or 
suspected  adverse  reaction  is considered  “serious”  if, in the view of either the  investigator  or sponsor,  
it results  in any of the following  outcomes:  
 
1. Death.   A death that occurs  during  the study  or that  comes  to the attention  of the investigator  
during  the protocol -defined follow -up after the completion of therapy  must be  reported whether  
it is considered to be treatment related or not.  
 
2. A life-threatening  adverse event.  A life-threatening  event  is any adverse  therapy  experience 
that, in the view of the investigator, places  the participant at immediate  risk of death from the 
reaction  as it occurred.  
 
3. Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_707],  with the exception of 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_253862] [ADDRESS_308885].  
 
6. Important medical  events  that may  not result  in death, be life-threatening,  or require  
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_28613],  based  upon  appropriate medical  judgment,  
they may jeopardize  the participant  and may require  medical  or surgical  intervention  to prevent  
one of the outcomes  listed  above.  
 
An adverse  event  or suspected  adverse  reaction  is considered  “life-threatening” if, in  the view  of either the 
investigator  or sponsor, its occurrence  places  the participant  at immediate  risk of death.  It does  not include  an 
adverse  event  or suspected  adverse  reaction  that, had  it occurred in a more  severe  form, might  have caused 
death.  
Regardless  of the relationship  of the adverse  event  to study  drug, the event  must be  reported  as a 
serious  adverse  event  if it meets  any of the above definitions.  
 
6.1.4.  Unexpected Adverse Event  
An adverse  event  is considered  unexpected  when the nature  (specificity) or  severity  of the event  is not 
consistent with  the risks described  in the protocol  or informed consent document for a particular  
protocol  required intervention.  Unexpected refers  to an experience that has not been  previously  
observed.   This includes  events  that occur more  frequently  than expected.  
 
 
Page  21 of 37  
TrialNet  Protocol  TN20  Protocol  Version:  15Jan2016  
 
6.1.5.  Grading Event Severity  
TrialNet has  adopted  usage  of the most current version of the National  Cancer Institute  (NCI)  Common  
Toxicity  Criteria  for Adverse  Events  (with  the exception of hyper  or hypoglycemia  including the 
diagnosis  of diabetes whether  or not it requires  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_253863] ).  In the context of 
this trial, hypoglycemia will be defined as follows: (a ) mild hypoglycemia is defined as signs and 
symptoms associated with hypoglycemia and glucos e <50 mg/dl that responds to initial oral treatment 
and does not recur during observation period, (b) prolonged hypoglycemia is defined as signs and 
symp toms associated with hypoglycemia and glucose < 50 mg/dl that responds to oral treatment but 
is persistent or recurs during observation period, and (c) sever e hypoglycemia is defined as signs and 
symptoms associated with hypoglycemia that does not respond t o oral treatment or requires  
assistanc e from others due to altered consciousness. Data  regarding onset  of diabetes  are gathered  
as study  measures.  TrialNet  Investigators  will also provide an assessment of relationship of AE to 
study  drug as not, unlikely,  possibly,  probably,  or definitely  related.  
 
6.2. Adverse Event  Reporting and Monitoring 
Adverse  events  will be reported to the TrialNet  Coordinating  Center  in accordance  with the TrialNet  
Adverse  Event  Monitoring Plan (and according  to study  specific  criteria  stated in section 6.1. The 
investigator  will grade their severity according  to common  toxicity  criteria  or study -specific  criteria  and 
will make  a determination  as to the relation  to therapy.   Events  will be assessed  and reported  in 
accordance with the ICH Guidelines  for Good Clinical Practice, 21  CFR 312.32  for expedited  safety  
reporting,  and per the guidance  of the DHHS  Office  for Human Research  Protections  (OHRP).  
 
The adverse  event  case  report form for  the protocol  must  be completed  for all adverse  events  greater  
or equal  to Grade  2 of the NCI CTCAE  with the exception  of hyper  or hypoglycemia  including  the 
diagnosis  of diabetes  whether or not it requires  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_253864].   For reporting  serious  
adverse  events  (SAE), the TrialNet  MedWatch  Form should  also be completed and faxed  to the TNCC  
within  [ADDRESS_308886] regular  safety  reviews  approximately  every  six months  (and, as  needed)  of adverse  
events  by [CONTACT_253894].   Serious  adverse events  as well as adverse  events  leading  to 
study  discontinuation will be reviewed by [CONTACT_4318].  
 
For SAEs  that are  unexpected  and considered  possibly  or probably  drug related, the Medical  Monitor  will 
provide information  on frequency  of similar  events, and generate FDA form 3500A  reports  (MedWatch 
form) for distribution  to FDA, NIDDK, DSMB  and site investigators.   Expedited safety  reports  will be 
submitted  to the IND by [CONTACT_49010].  
 
7. PARTICIPANT  SAFETY  
 
7.1. Risks,  Benefits  and Inclusion  of Children 
The risks of this study  are presented below  and in the informed  consent  form.  
 
There is the prospect  of direct  benefit to the individual  participants  for their participation  in the study.  
These  potential  benefits  include  the recognized  benefits  of being  in a clinical  study,  including close  
monitoring  offered  to all participants  regardless  of group assignment.   Further, the intervention  has the 
prospect of direct  benefit to a given  participant  as all participant s will receive  active  drug,  which  may 
delay  or prevent  disease  progression.   Moreover,  the study is  likely  to yield general  knowledge about  
Page  22 of 37  
TrialNet  Protocol  TN20  Protocol  Version:  15Jan2016  
 
T1D which  is of importance  for the understanding  and amelioration of T1D in children.  
 
The study  procedures,  consisting  of blood draws  and oral glucose  tolerance  testing,  are minimal risk. 
Moreover,  with over 1,[ADDRESS_308887]  
been reported,  suggesting  that administration  of oral insulin  is also minimal risk. However,  as it remains  
an investigational  agent, taking  oral insulin  may be considered only slightly  greater than  minimal  risk. 
Also,  it offers  the possibility  of benefit  due to the close  monitoring  for all participants,  including  children.   
Assent  of children  along  with consent  of the parent/legal  guardian will be obtained prior to any study  
procedures.  This research proposal  in children is therefore consistent with the United  States  
Department  of Health  and Human Services,  Protection of Human Subjects, Subpart D,  section  46.405 
(research  involving  slightly  greater than  minimal  risk but presenting  the prospect of direct  benefit to 
individual  subjects) and  with Subpart D.  50. 52 (Clinical  investigations  involving  greater than  minimal  
risk but presenting  the prospect  of direct benefit to  individual  subjects).  
 
7.2. Expected  Side  Effects  and Adverse Events  
There were  no side effects  or adverse  events  associated  with oral insulin  during  the DPT-[ADDRESS_308888] suggested that it is theoretically  possible  that oral insulin  
could  accelerate disease,  there is no evidence of disease acceleration or hypoglycemia in the ongoing 
TN07  trial in which  >[ADDRESS_308889] received  oral insulin  up to 8 years.  There  were no associated  
adverse effects  including no hypoglycemia noted  in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_83714] -POINT  study,  which used  higher  doses  
of oral insulin,  similar  to what will be used in this trial. As illustrated below, no change i n glucose values 
were observed ( 45). 
 
 
 
7.3. Protecting  Against  or Minimizing  Potential  Treatment Risks 
Participants  who have other  active  serious  medical  problems  will not be enrolled.  To assure that every 
other week doses of insulin are well tolerated, those in the every other week dosing group will receive 
an initial dose of 135 mg oral insulin and a second dose of 250 mg oral insulin, before receiving the full 
500 mg dose every other week.  
As noted above (section 7.2), oral insulin is not metabolically active; thus , no hypoglycemia from study 
medication is expected.  Moreover, asymptomatic  and not clinically important  hypoglycemia can occur  
in those with beta cell dysfunction (44). Individuals with pre- treatment glucose values < 50 mg/dl at 
screening or at study vis its V0 (A), V0(B), or V1  will not receive any further study medication.   Those 
who receive study drug  at these visits  will be observed for 2 hours after the dose of study medication.  
If signs or symptoms consistent with hypoglycemia are observed, the participant’s blood glucose will 
be checked.  If glucose is < 50 mg/dl, the participant will be treated as needed and observed at least 
Page  23 of 37  
TrialNet  Protocol  TN20  Protocol  Version:  15Jan2016  
 
an additional hour before discharge when glucose ≥50 mg/dl.   Any individual with mild, prolonged, or 
severe hypoglycemia during this period will not receive any further study medic ation but will continue 
to be monitored per protocol (Appendix A) . 
In the unlikely event that any individual has prolonged or severe hypoglycemia (as defined in section 
6.1.5), or if [ADDRESS_308890] mild hypoglycemia (as defined in section 6.1.5), further enrollment 
will be temporarily suspended pending full review by [CONTACT_253895] .  
Regular  monitoring of participants  and active  inquiry  will allow  for early identification  of adverse events.  
 
7.4. Pregnancy 
Pregnant  and lactating  women will not be included  in this study.  Females  must  have a negative 
pregnancy  test prior to enrolling  in the study  and will be required  to either  use birth control  or practice  
abstinence  during  the study.  At every  study  visit, the sexual  activity of female participants  of 
reproductive  age will be re-assessed.  If a participant  who was previously  sexually  inactive  becomes  
sexually  active,  she will be counseled  about  the need to use a reliable  form of birth control.  All female  
participants  of reproductive potential  will undergo urine  pregnancy  tests  at regular  intervals.  
 
8. STATISTICAL  CONSIDERATIONS  AND  ANALYSIS PLAN  
 
8.1. Overview  
This is a randomized study  designed  to assess  the impact  of two different  oral insulin  regimens  on 
immune function and markers  in participant s at risk for T1D.  Specifically, patients will be randomized to 
receive either daily (6 7.5 mg/day) or biweekly (starting at 135 mg up to 500 mg as tolerated every other 
week) oral insulin dosing. The primary  goals  of this study  are focused on assessing  immune  and 
inflammation markers  before  and after administration  of these two different  oral insulin  regimens  in this 
patient  population,  and how these  immunological  biomarker  changes  differ between the treatment  arms.  
 
8.2. Study  Design,  Accrual,  and Study  Duration 
The overarching  goal of this study  is to evaluate how varying  oral insulin  regimens  affect  immune  
function  and related markers.  Specifically,  eligible  participant s will be randomized to one of two 
oral insulin  regimens  defined  in Section 3.5. The accrual  period for this trial will be approximately  
9 months;  based  on historical  data from the ongoing  TN07  study  of oral insulin  in this same  population,  
we plan to enroll  a total of [ADDRESS_308891]-treatment  sample collection,  
which  would make them  not evaluable for the primary  mechanistic  endpoint.  
 
Eligible  patients  will be randomized  to one of two oral insulin  regimens  in a 1:1 allocation using  block  
randomization  with variable  block  sizes.  To ameliorate  the possible  confounding  effects  of age on the 
immunologic  primary  endpoint  markers,  randomization  will be stratified  by [CONTACT_253896]  (<10 vs. 
≥10 years  old) to ensure balance  of this factor  across  the two arms.  Given  that this is a mechanistic  
study  focusing  on effects  on the immune  system  after treatment  with these varying  oral insulin  
regimens,  we will employ  a treatment -received  analysis  approach.  Any participant  who receives  at 
least one dose  of oral insulin  in accordance to their treatment  arm will be considered evaluable and 
will be included in these analyses.  
 
In lieu of a placebo arm, we will use the two baseline  samples  on each participant  to gauge  the 
intra- participant  variability  and likelihood  of immunologic  changes  for the key biomarkers  in the 
absence  of treatment.

8.3. Analysis  Plan 
Immune function  can be assessed through  multiple  (often  correlated)  markers  as well as additional  
cytokine/inflammation/genetic  markers;  however,  our primary  outcome is the change in immune 
function as assessed  by [CONTACT_253897] T lymphocyte or autoantibody  biomarkers  of β-cell specific  
immune  response  measured  between [ADDRESS_308892] dose  versus  baseline.  As described 
in Section  3.2, specific  outcome  measures  may include  CD4 auto- antigen  specific  ELISPOTs  for IFN- 
γ and IL-17, and CD8 peptide -HLA multimers  (Q-dots)  and other  assays from just before  treatment  to 
3-months  post-treatment.  To identify  the most  promising  regimen  of oral insulin  in terms  of immunologic  
change,  we will compare  these  changes  in the selected immunobiomarkers  between  the treatment  
arms.  Specifically,  we will calculate the fold change  from baseline  pre-treatment  to [ADDRESS_308893] 
in these measures  in the absence  of treatment,  we will “normalize”  these fold change measures  
such  that you have  the 3-month post-treatment  sample  marker  levels  divided  by [CONTACT_253898]  [ADDRESS_308894], and then divide  that by [CONTACT_253899] “control  phase”,  
or the no-treatment  phase,  so to speak,  with the ratio of the day 0 baseline  to the sample  marker  
levels  2-4 weeks  prior to treatment  (i.e. FC 2 ÷ FC 1 from above figure).  
We recognize that some of these  measures  may not have detectable  levels  at baseline or even after 
treatment.  Since  it is important  to capture not only a maintenance of undetectable  counts  of these 
markers  but also to capture  if there is an increase  in these  markers  (for better  or worse),  we will 
impute the midpoint  between 0 and the lower  limit of detection (LLOD)  specific  to the assay  and 
plate/run for participant s identified as having  measures  below  the LLOD  for that marker.  In the setting  
where levels  below  the LLOD  can be estimated  from a standard curve  with the assay,  we will still 
consider  these unreliable estimates  below  the LLOD  and will impute the midpoint  as well. If levels  for 
a participant  remain undetectable  before  and after treatment,  then this imputation  allows  them  to 
be captured as having  a fold change  equal  to one for that marker,  indicating  no change.  This 
will, however,  allow  capture  of an increase  in these  levels  for that marker  in that participant  if pre-
treatment  levels  are below  the LLOD  but increase above that threshold  post-treatment.  This is 
particularly  important  for measures such as  the ELISPOT  measures  of IFN-γ and IL-17, where an 
increase  in these markers  is considered  a negative  outcome.  
In this setting,  a fold change or ratio equal  to 1 reflects  no change  in the marker(s) after treatment  with 
oral insulin.  For each of the markers  (e.g. ELISPOT  IFN-γ, ELISPOT  IL-17, peptide- HLA multimers  – 
naïve,  effector,  stem -like) we will use nonparametric  two-sided  Mann -Whitney -Wilcoxon  (rank  sum)  
tests  to compare the fold changes  in these markers  (via ranks)  between  the arms.  Since  we are 
comparing  fold change  measures  for each  participant , and how this responsiveness  to oral insulin  
therapy  differs  based  on dose and schedule,  we expect  that each  arm will have some level of 
responsiveness  and thus our comparison  will be focused  on which  induces  a greater  change  to the 
markers.  With [ADDRESS_308895]  80% power  to detect  a difference  
in the fold changes  between  the arms  for each of the markers  (vs. the null hypothesis  that there is no

arm is 1.5 (a 50% increase)  and that the true mean  fold change in the other  treatment  arm is at least 
2.3 (i.e. a 2.3 fold increase in marker  level).  This conservatively  constrains  the Type  I error  to 0.01 
(based  on a Bonferroni  correction  to accommodate  the simultaneous  evaluation  of up to five different  
immunologic  markers  in these  comparisons ).  These calculations  assume  an underlying  normal  
distribution  of the measures  after a log [ADDRESS_308896] 80% power  to detect  a difference in marker fold change  between  the arms  if the true mean 
fold change for the other  arm is 2.64.  The same  power  statements  hold for the inverse of these;  i.e. to 
detect  significant  differences  for these  magnitudes  of differences  in the reduction  of these  markers  
(e.g. mean  fold change  of 0.67 vs. 0.435).  Even  in the unlikely  case  that the true underlying  distribution  
of these fold changes  for the markers  is actually  a uniform  distribution,  we will still have at least 80% 
power  to detect  a difference between the arms  if the average fold changes  are 2.[ADDRESS_308897]  90% power  to detect  
a significant change in a marker  if the true mean  fold change  is at least 1.4 (i.e. a fold increase by 1.4 
or greater)   or  a  decrease  of  the  same 
magnitude (fold change of 0.72)  
versus the null hypothesis  in this 
single -arm evaluation  that there is no 
change  in these markers  before and 
after treatment  (with  the same other  
assumptions  as above:  significance  
level of 0.01,  underlying  normal  
distribution  for the log [ADDRESS_308898]  deviation  of 0.5 on 
that scale).  Even  if there  is greater  
variability  in the  measures  for the  
underlying  distribution  (e.g. sd=0.75),  
we will still have at least 80% power  to 
detect  a significant  change  in these   
markers  after oral insulin  treatment  if 
the true mean  fold change is 1.6 (or 
conversely,  0.625)  versus the null 
hypothesis   that  the true mean  fold 
change  is 1.0.

detect  a significant  difference  in fold change  if the true mean fold change  after treatment  is 1.35 or 
greater  vs. no change  (fold change  of 1) between the two baseline  assessments.  
 
To visually  assess  patterns  of change,  we will graphically  analyze  the fold change for each of the 
immunologic  markers  at each of the timepoints  for each  treatment  arm. Since  the kinetics  of immune  
change  and response  at certain  timepoints  are currently  unknown,  we will evaluate this first using  
descriptive  statistics  to characterize the fold change measures  at each of the timepoints  after treatment  
is started:  1, 2, 3, and 6, as well as after treatment  is completed:  7, 8, 9, and 12 months.  Repeated 
measures  ANOVA models  will also be used to compare  the responsiveness  to oral insulin  regimens  
in terms  of fold changes  for each of the immunologic  biomarkers.  Multivariate  ANOVA  (MANOVA)  
models  will also be used to compare more  broadly  the impact  of these regimens  on immune 
function,  where the different  cell type markers  will be assessed  through this model  for CD4+  T cells 
and for CD8+  T cells.  To assess  longer -term impact  of an oral insulin  regimen  on immune  cell 
mobilization,  we will evaluate fold changes  in these  markers  after completion  of therapy  (e.g. at 7 and 
9 months  after initiation  of treatment)  to assess whether  or not any immune  stimulation  is maintained.  
Pairwise  comparisons  of the fold change  in markers  will be made between  arms  for the various  
timepoints  using  two-sided  nonparametric  Wilcoxon  rank sum tests,  as well as graphically  using  side-  
by-side boxplots.  
 
In addition,  we will evaluate  the impact  of treatment  arm and other  demographic  and clinical factors  
such  as age, gender,  and autoantibody  profile in the univariate setting  on these  biomarkers,  as well 
as assess  the influence of treatment  arm when adjusting for age and other  factors  in the multivariable  
setting.  Here,  we can also assess  the influence of other  immunologic  markers  of interest  on these 
changes  in the primary  immune  biomarkers  being evaluated above.  Since  timing  of immune  response 
is not well understood in this setting,  we will also evaluate  changes  in these markers  over time,  
particularly  after treatment  is completed.  
 
In a secondary  manner,  we will also evaluate multiple  additional  immunologic  markers,  such as  
phenotypic  markers:  naïve,  effector  memory,  and central  memory  CD4+  T cells and CD8+  T cells as 
well as regulatory  T cells.  These markers  will be measured  as absolute numbers  per mL, and will be 
assessed  at baseline  (i.e. prior to oral insulin  treatment)  as well as at multiple  timepoints  during  and 
after treatment  (Appendix  A). Given  that our focus  is on how these  oral insulin  regimens  affect  
immune  cell mobilization  and thus a response  by [CONTACT_253900],  we will assess  the fold change  
at the various  timepoints  (i.e. the ratio of the post-treatment level to the  baseline marker  levels).  
 
Secondary endpoints will also include clinical responses to treatment as measured by [CONTACT_253901]. C-peptide levels along with insulin and glucose levels before and after 
treatment  will be captured and evaluated to better ch aracterize these participant s, particularly in relation 
to changes in immune markers.  
 
8.4. Toxicity  and Tolerability  
Analysis  of this trial will include summarization of the toxicity  and tolerability  by [CONTACT_253902]’s  
CTCAE  with the exception of hypoglycemia,  which will be summarized by [CONTACT_253903] 6.1.5.  Frequency  and severity  of adverse  events  and tolerability  of the regimen  in each 
of the treatment  arms  will be collected  and summarized using  descriptive statistics.  As per NCI CTCAE,  
the term toxicity  is defined  as adverse  events  that are classified  as either  possibly,  probably,  or 
definitely  related  to study  treatment. The maximum grade  for each type of toxicity  will be recorded 
for each  patient, and  frequency  tables  will be reviewed to determine toxicity  patterns.  In addition, we 
will review  all adverse  event  data that is graded  as 3, 4, or 5 and classified  as either  “unrelated”  or 
“unlikely  to be related”  to study  treatment  in the event  of an actual  relationship developi[INVESTIGATOR_007].  The 
Page  27 of 37  
TrialNet  Protocol  TN20  Protocol  Version:  15Jan2016  
 
incidence  of severe  (grade  3+) adverse events  or toxicities  will be described.   
In addition,  we will also capture  the proportion  of participant s who go off treatment  due to adverse  
reactions  or those  who refuse further  treatment  for lesser  toxicities  that inhibit  their willingness  to 
continue  participation  on the trial. These tolerability   measures   will  be  assessed   within   each  of  the  
treatment   arms   and  we  will  evaluate differences  in these  measures  between  the arms.  All participant s 
who have received  at least one dose in a treatment arm  will be evaluable for toxicity  and tolerability.  
In order to closely monitor for hypoglycemia, all participant s will have pre - and post -dose glucose, 
insulin, and C -peptide levels for each treatment arm  evaluated . We will closely monitor and 
summarize glucose levels before and after treatment as specified . Incidence of mild, prolonged, and 
severe hypoglycemia events will be summarized based on the definitions in Section 6.1.5.  
Although unlikely and not expected, we will closely monitor for hypoglycemia events as defined in Section 
6.1.5. If at any time any patient is reported to have prolonged or severe hypoglycemia  or if at any time 
two or more patients are reported as having m ild hypoglycemia based on these definitions, we will 
temporarily suspend accrual to the trial pending full review by [CONTACT_3476], Medical Monitor.  
 
8.5. Primary  Outcome 
The primary  outcome is the change in immune function as assessed  by [CONTACT_253897] T lymphocyte 
or autoantibody  biomarkers  of β-cell specific  immune  response measured between [ADDRESS_308902] dose  versus  baseline.  
 
9. ETHICAL  CONSIDERATIONS  AND  COMPLIANCE  WITH  GOOD  CLINICAL  PRACTICE  
 
9.1. Statement  of Compliance 
This study  will be conducted  in compliance  with the protocol  and consistent  with current  Good  Clinical  
Practices  (GCP),  adopting  the principles  of the Declaration  of Helsinki,  and all applicable regulatory  
requirements ( ICH E6, 45CFR46,  and FDA 21CFR  sections  11, 50, 56, 312). 
 
Prior  to study  initiation,  the protocol  and the informed  consent  documents  will be reviewed  and 
approved by [CONTACT_253904] /Research  Ethics  Board  (IEC/REB)  or 
Institutional  Review  Board (IRB).  Any amendments  to the protocol  or consent  materials  must  also be 
approved  before they are implemented.  
 
9.2. Participating  Centers 
Participating  TrialNet  clinical  sites must  have an appropriate assurance,  such  as a Federal -wide 
Assurance  (FWA)  or an Unaffiliated  Investigators  Agreement  (UIA),  with the Office  for Human  
Research Protections  (OHRP),  since  they are actively engaged  in research  and provide informed 
consent.  The protocol  and consent  forms  will be approved by [CONTACT_253905]/Research Ethics  Boards  at each of the participating  clinical  sites.  HIPAA  and applicable  
local regulations  will be followed by [CONTACT_253906]’s  
requirements.  The participating  international  sites will obtain  approval  from their corresponding 
review  boards  in accordance with their local procedures  and institutional  requirements.  
 
The investigator  is required to keep  accurate records  to ensure the conduct  of the study  is fully 
documented.  The investigator  is required  to ensure that all case  report  forms  are legibly  completed 
for every  participant  entered  in the trial. 
 
9.3. Informed  Consent  
The process  of assuring  that individuals  (and parent/guardian if less than 18 years  of age) are making  
an informed  decision  about  participating  in this study  includes  both verbal  and written  communication.  
Page  28 of 37  
TrialNet  Protocol  TN20  Protocol  Version:  15Jan2016  
 
Written  material  includes  a Participant  Handbook,  Volunteer  Understanding  Assessment,  and written  
consent  forms.  The consent  form describes  the procedures,  risks,  and benefits  for the study.  The 
consent form  will be reviewed with participants  (and their guardian in the case  of participants  under  18 
years  of age) and the participant  will be given time to review  the written  consent  form and ask 
questions.  An assent  form has also been  developed for participants  less than 18 years  of age (unless  
local IRB requirements  differ in  procedure).  
 
As part of the informed consent  process,  the participant  and/or  parent  or guardian  (if the participant  is 
less than 18 years  of age) will also complete a short,  written  Volunteer  Understanding Assessment  
that is designed to ensure  that the participant  understands  the study,  as well as what is being asked  
of him/her. The participant  will be given a copy  of their signed  consent/assent forms.  
 
The consent  process  will be conducted  by [CONTACT_58673]  (the Trial or Study  Coordinator  
and/or  Investigator  or other  designee).  All participants  (or their legally  acceptable representatives)  
must  read,  sign and date a consent  form prior to participation  in the study,  and/or  undergoing any 
study -specific  procedures.  
 
The informed  consent  form must  be updated  or revised  whenever  there  is new, clinically  significant  
information  applicable to the safety  of the participants,  when indicated  for a protocol  amendment,  
and/or  whenever  any new information  becomes  available that may affect  a participant’s  participation 
in the study.  
 
Participants  will be re-consented  if they reach  the age of [ADDRESS_308903]  permit  authorized 
representatives  of the sponsor(s)  and regulatory  agencies  to examine (and when required  by 
[CONTACT_61285], to copy)  records  for the purposes  of quality  assurance reviews,  audits,  and evaluation  
of the study  safety  and progress.  Unless  required  by [CONTACT_253907],  only the 
coded  identity  associated  with documents  or other  participant  data may be copi[INVESTIGATOR_530]  (obscuring  any 
personally  identifying  information).  Authorized representatives  as noted  above are bound  to maintain  
the strict confidentiality  of medical  and research  information  that may be linked  to identify  individuals.  
The investigational  site will normally  be notified  in advance  of auditing  visits.

10. STUDY  ADMINISTRATION  
 
10.1.  Organizational  Structure  
 
This study  is part of Type  1 Diabetes  TrialNet,  which  is funded by [CONTACT_154108],  
principally  the National  Institute  of Diabetes,  Digestive  and Kidney  Diseases.  Funding  will cover  the 
costs  of administration  and laboratory  tests  associated with this study  during the participant’s  period 
of follow -up. Eli Lilly  and Company  will provide oral insulin crystals  free of charge.  
 
The proposed study  medication,  oral insulin,  is not commercially  available.  Eli Lilly and Company  is 
providing  the oral insulin  crystals for this  study.  
 
10.2.  Groups  and Committees  
 
10.2.1.  Oral Insulin Trial Protocol Committee  
The Study  Chair  and TrialNet  Executive Committee  will receive periodic  reports  from the TNCC on the 
progress  of the study.  These will include accrual  rates  and baseline demographic  characteristics.  
Interim  data summaries  provided to others  (except  those that could lead to unmasking  of study  
outcome)  will first be supplied to the Study  Chair  for review.  Criteria  and results  of ongoing monitoring  
of the TrialNet  labs in terms  of reproducibility  will also be provided on a routine basis  and reported  on 
during  the Joint  Prevention  Study  Chair  Committee  meetings,  as scheduled.  As appropriate,  abstracts  
and manuscripts  dealing  with the progress  of the trial shall be directed  by [CONTACT_77916]20 Immune Effects  of 
Oral Insulin  Trial Protocol  Committee.  
 
10.2.2.  TrialNet Chairman’s Office, TrialNet Coordinating Center, and the TrialNet Hub 
The TrialNet  Chairman’s  Office,  the TNCC,  and the TrialNet  Hub will collaboratively  provide  
leadership  to the TrialNet  study  group to include  protocol  and manual  preparation,  training for clinical  
sites,  development  of statistical  design  for each  study,  analysis  of study  results  and the preparation of 
publications  and presentations.  The TNCC  will also coordinate interactions  among  the participating  
TrialNet  Clinical sites,  laboratories  including TrialNet  core laboratories  and other  subcontract  
laboratories,  NIDDK, and  other  sponsoring  agencies.  
 
10.2.3.  Clinical Sites  
Principal  Investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_253865]. 
The clinical  sites will forward  all laboratory  and data collection  form information to the TNCC  for 
analysis.  Direct  communication and site visits,  as needed,  will facilitate  evaluation  of the trial 
management.  
 
10.2.4.  Safety Monitoring Committee and Medical Monitor  
The Type 1 Diabetes  TrialNet  Safety  Monitoring  Subcommittee (SMS)  is responsible for establishing  
policies  and procedures  for assurance of safety  monitoring  of TrialNet  protocols  and of TrialNet  
participants.  The Safety  committee  will review  all serious  AEs and receive  summary  reports  of all 
AEs.   
All adverse events  will be recorded  on the adverse event  forms,  which  will be sent to the local 
IRBs/REBs, per their reporting  requirements,  and to the TNCC.  
An independent  physician will be designated  to serve  as the medical  monitor  for this study  who will 
maintain regular  contact  [CONTACT_253908].  (S)he  will review  all adverse  event  
reports  and will file event  reports  with regulatory  authorities  as appropriate 
 
Page  30 of 37  
TrialNet  Protocol  TN20  Protocol  Version:  15Jan2016  
 
10.2.5.  Clinical Site Monitoring  
In order  to conduct  this study  with established  research  principles  and ICH-GCP  guidelines,  site visits  
will be conducted  during  the study  to evaluate study  conduct  and ensure participant  safety.  All sites 
will be monitored by [CONTACT_253909],  
compliance  with protocol  procedures,  completeness  and accuracy  of data entered  on the case  report  
forms  (CRFs),  the occurrence  and reporting  of adverse  events  (AEs) and serious  adverse  events  
(SAEs),  site pharmacy  accountability/operations,  and to confirm  the presence of appropriate IRB/REB  
regulatory  approvals/documents.  
 
10.2.6.  Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB)  
The DSMB  will meet  approximately  every  6 months  to review  the potential  toxicity  and tolerability  of 
the study  treatments  as defined in Sections 8.4.1 and 7.3 based on interim  summaries and reports 
prepared  by [CONTACT_48978].  The DSMB will independently  evaluate whether  there are grounds  to modify or 
discontinue the study.  
 
10.3.  Sample and Data  Storage 
Stored samples,  including  genetic  material,  could  be utilized  to learn  more  about  causes  of type 1 
diabetes,  its complications  (such  as eye, nerve,  and kidney  damage)  and other  conditions  for which  
individuals  with diabetes  are at increased  risk, and how to improve  treatment. 
 
Samples  to be stored for research purposes  will be located at the NIDDK  Repository  and at TrialNet  
Sites.  While TrialNet  is active,  the use of the samples  will be restricted  to TrialNet  researchers  unless  
researchers  from outside  of TrialNet  obtain approval  from the TrialNet  Steering  Committee  and the 
NIDDK  to utilize  the samples.  The samples  will be coded  with unique  study  numbers,  but TrialNet  
researchers  will be able to identify  samples  if it is necessary  to contact  [CONTACT_253910].  Approval  from the TrialNet  Steering  Committee and the 
NIDDK  would be required  before  such  linkage  could  occur.  Researchers  from outside  of TrialNet  will 
not be permitted  to identify  samples.  
 
Data  collected for this study  will be sent to the TrialNet  Coordinating  Center  at the University  of South 
[LOCATION_012].  After  the study  is completed,  de-identified  data will be stored  at the NIDDK  Repository,  under  
the supervision of the NIDDK/NIH, for use by [CONTACT_253911].  
 
When  TrialNet  is completed,  samples  will continue  to be stored at the NIDDK  Repository  Sites.  Since  
the stored data will be fully de-identified  upon the completion  of TrialNet,  it will no longer  be possible  
to identify  samples.  However,  there  will still be the potential  to link data derived from the samples  with 
data that had been  derived from TrialNet  studies.  Once  TrialNet  is completed,  researchers  will only 
obtain access  to samples  through  grant  proposals  approved by [CONTACT_49010].  The NIDDK  will convene 
an external  panel  of experts  to review  requests  for access  to samples.  
 
Genetic  and other biological  material  will be stored  for future use with the permission  of the study  
participant  as described  above.  The results  of these future  analyses  will not be made  known  to the 
participant . 
 
10.4.  Preservation  of the Integrity  of the Study  
The scientific  integrity  of the trial dictates  that results  be reported on a study -wide basis;  thus,  an 
individual  clinical  site will not report  the data collected  from its site alone.  All presentations  and 
publications  using  TrialNet  data must  protect  the main  objectives  of the trial. Data that could  be 
perceived  as threatening  these objectives  will not be presented  prior to release  of the primary  study  
outcomes.  The TrialNet  Publications  and Presentations  Committee  will approve the timing  of 
Page  31 of 37  
TrialNet  Protocol  TN20  Protocol  Version:  15Jan2016  
 
presentations  of data and the meetings  at which  they might  be presented,  and the publication  of 
results  and the selection  of the journal  to which  each  paper  will be submitted for publication.  Study  
results  should be discussed  with the news  media  only upon  authorization of the Executive  Committee,  
but never  before the results  are presented.  Any written  statements  about  this study  that are shared

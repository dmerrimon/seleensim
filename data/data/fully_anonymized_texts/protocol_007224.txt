o anti-Cytomegalovirus (CMV)  
 Number and proportion of subjects who failed to meet 
the target IgG trough level (500  mg/dL) at any time 
point equal to or subseque nt to 5th infusion (estimated 
5 half-lives). 
ANALYTICAL PLAN / 
STATISTICAL METHOD  Efficacy data will be evaluated by [CONTACT_690672] -sided 99%  
confidence limit < 1.[ADDRESS_937073] per year. The primary 
safety endpoint will be analyzed with the objective of 
demonstrating that the percentage of infusions with one or 
more infusion -related AE is less than 40% . 
Pharmacokinetic parameters (clearance, mean residence 
time, volume of distribution, and terminal half -life) will be 
estimated by [CONTACT_690673] s 
individually to the data for each subject in the PK 
population, except for the AUC which will be determined 
using a (log -) trapezoidal rule as the area above the 
previous trough level.  Pharmacokinetic parameters will  be 
derived from serum IgG levels and presented descriptively.  
Trough levels of IgG subclasses will be summarized 
relative to  dosing interval. All other data will be reported 
descriptively.

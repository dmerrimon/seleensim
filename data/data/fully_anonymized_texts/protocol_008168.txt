Version 4.0, 01 March 2019  7STUDY DESIGN AND DURATION:  
This is a Phase 2, multicenter, double -blind, randomized, placebo -controlled study to evaluate the 
effect of iloprost on the symptomatic relief of RP attacks in subjects with symptomatic RP 
secondary to SSc. The study will be pi[INVESTIGATOR_239593], tes ting the study 
endpoints and logistics of study operations that include, among other things, an  ePRO diary for 
the evaluation of subject response to the treatment as well as the infusion workflow for this 
multi day treatment. Subjects are allowed to continu e receiving stable standard of care therapi[INVESTIGATOR_239594] (eg, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin -converting 
enzyme inhibitors, statins, fluoxetine, and low dose acetylsalicylic acid ) or may participate 
without  the use of  background standard of care therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
The study will enroll up to a maximum of  [ADDRESS_290776] information regarding all symptomatic RP attacks (eg, severity of symptoms, 
duration, and hand function). The up to 30 -day screening period consists of a 5 -day eligibility 
period and an up to 25 -day baseline e PRO diary completion period:  
• During the [ADDRESS_290777] 3 separate days of the 5 -day 
eligibility period.  
• During the baselin e ePRO diary completion period, eligible subjects must  complete the daily 
ePRO diary for a minimum of 10 days (up to a maximum of 25 days) until the day of 
randomization. It may be necessary to extend the baseline ePRO  diary  completion period 
beyond [ADDRESS_290778] concentrations using validated liquid chromatography mass spectrometry methods.  
Subjects will be randomized in a 1 :[ADDRESS_290779] ug for 
5 consecutive days ( eg, Monday through Friday) as an IV infusion over 6  hours each day  via a 
peripheral line  (NovaCath ™ Integrated IV Catheter System) or a peripherally inserted central 
catheter (PI[INVESTIGATOR_6875]) using an infusion  pump . 
Subjects must have a systolic blood pressure 85 mmHg (sitting position) prior to study drug 
administration  each day of administration . On Day 1, study drug will be initiated at a starting dose 
of 0.5 ng/kg/min, and dose increases will occur every 30 minut es (5 minutes) in increments of 
0.5 ng/kg/min up to 2.0 ng/kg/min or the individual tolerated dose. If dose -limiting adverse events 
(eg, headache, flushing, jaw pain, myalgia, nausea, or vomiting) occur that cannot be tolerated by 
[CONTACT_423], then the do se will be reduced in a step wise manner by 0.5 ng/kg/min every 30 minutes 
(5 minutes), until a tolerated dose is determined. If symptomatic hypotension or a dose -limiting 
adverse event occurs during administration of iloprost at the starting dose (ie, 0. 5 ng/kg/min), the

Version 4.0, 01 March 2019  8infusion will be reduced to 0.25 ng/kg/min. If the dose of 0.25 ng/kg/min is not tolerated due to 
symptomatic hypotension or a dose -limiting adverse event occurs , the study drug will be 
discontinued and reinitiation of the infusion can be  attempted after the event has resolved or been 
treated. Blood pressure and heart rate will be monitored 15 minutes ( 5 minutes) prior to and after 
all dose changes. If the subject experiences symptomatic hypotension or any other adverse event 
that cannot be tolerated, as determined by [CONTACT_737], during administration of study drug, 
the dose will be reduced or the infusion will be stopped until the symptoms resolve, at which point 
the study drug should be reinitiated at a previously tolerated dose. T he maximum tolerated dose 
will be  maintained for the remaining 6 -hour da ily period. At the end of the 6 -hour infusion period, 
the dose will be stopped. Subjects will be monitored for up to 1 hour after completion of study 
drug infusion (ie, vital signs wil l be obtained 15 minutes [ 5 minutes] and 1 hour [ 15 minutes] 
after completion of the infusion).  
On Days [ADDRESS_290780] and necessitate a reduction in the dose. Vital 
signs will be measured prior to study drug administration and at 15 minutes ( 5 minutes) prior to 
and after all dose changes during the infusion. Additionally, vital signs will be monitored at 
15 minutes (5 minutes) and 1 hour ( 15 minutes) after c ompletion of the 6 -hour infusion.  
During the treatment  period  (Days 1 to 5 ), while subjects receive study drug, the ePRO diary will 
not be completed. No study assessments will be performed on the 2 days following the end of 
treatment (Days 6 and 7, eg, Sa turday and Sunday) to allow the subject to rest and return to a 
schedule  of normal daily living activity  following the 5 days of infusions.  
Subjects will be contact[CONTACT_152087] 8 to ensure they resume completion of the  daily 
ePRO diary; subject s will complete the diary from Day [ADDRESS_290781] administration of study drug (Day 3 5).  
Subjects who discontinue study drug early will remain in the study (unless the subject withdraws 
consent) and complete  the daily  ePRO diary from Day [ADDRESS_290782]  will be up to approximately 9 weeks.  
DOSAGE FORMS AND ROUTE OF ADMINISTRATION:  
Iloprost injection  for IV use  and matching placebo will be supplied in vials  packaged in a blin ded 
study drug kit ( 10 vials per kit) . The iloprost and placebo vials will be identical, except [ADDRESS_290783] be diluted with 
sodium chloride 0.9% in a drug reservoir (IV bag) prior to use.  
Subjects will receive the study drug IV infusion s for 5 consecutive days  (eg, Monday to Friday) . 
Study drug will be administered after dilution as an IV infusion over 6 hours each day via a 
peripheral line (NovaCath Integrated IV Catheter System) or a PI[INVESTIGATOR_239595]. 
(Note: In some instances where the site chooses to use a PI[INVESTIGATOR_6875], it may be necessary to confirm 
placement of  the PI[INVESTIGATOR_239596] x -ray).

Version 4.0, 01 March 2019  9EFFICACY VARIABLES:  
The primary efficacy parameter is the change in the weekly frequency of symptomatic RP attacks 
from baseline . 
The exploratory  efficacy parameters  include change s from baseline to the end of the efficacy 
follow -up in the following:  
• Severity of RP attacks  as determined by [CONTACT_239619] (pain, numbness , 
tingling, and/or discomfort ) (using a Numeric Rating Scale [NRS] )  
• Raynaud’s Condition Score   
• Hand function as assessed by [CONTACT_239620]   
• Duration of symptomatic RP attacks  
• NRS  for worst pain associated with symptomatic RP  
• Patient assessment of overall improvement in symptomatic RP  
PHARMACOKINETIC VARIABLES:  
The following PK parameters will be calculated whenever possible, based on the plasma 
concentrations of iloprost:  
• Stead y state  plasma concentration just before infusion is stopped  
• Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) from time of dosing to the last 
time point with measurable concentration  
• AUC from time 0 extrapolated to infinity  
• Percentage of AUC obtained by [CONTACT_5259]  
• Plasma terminal elimination half -life  
• Plasma clearance  
• Volume of distribution  
SAFETY VARIABLES:  
Safety parameters will include all adverse events, physical examination findings, vital sign 
measurements  (heart rate and blood pressure) , 12-lead electrocardiogram  findings, and standard 
clinical laboratory measurements  (chemistry  and hematology) . 
STATISTICAL ANALYSES:  
All efficacy analyses are intended to provide an initial description of the clinical profile of iloprost 
and to inform the design  and logistics  of future studies.  
The modified Intent -to-Treat (mITT) Population is defined as all randomized subjects  who initiate 
infusion of study drug. The mITT Population is the primary efficacy analysis population.  
Eicos Sciences, Inc.  
Clinical Study Protocol ES -201 
Confidential & Proprietary   
Version 4.0, 01 March 2019  10The Per -Protocol (PP) Population is defined as subjects in the mITT Population who complete  at 
least Day  21 without any major protocol deviations. The PP Population will be used for sensitivity 
analyses of the primary efficacy variable.  
The Safety Population is defined as all randomized  subjects who  initiate infusion of study drug. 
The Safety Population will be used for all safety analyses.  
Primary efficacy analysi s 
The baseline weekly frequency of symptomatic RP attacks is defined as the average number of 
weekly symptomatic RP attacks occurring during the 10 - to 25 -day baseline ePRO diary 
completion period. The double -blind weekly symptomatic RP attacks is defined as the average 
number of weekly  symptomatic  RP attacks during Days 8 to 21. The primary efficacy parameter 
is the change in the weekly frequency of symptomatic RP attacks from baseline (ie, the mean 
number of weekly symptomatic RP attacks during Days 8 to 21 compared to during the 10 - to 
25-day baselin e ePRO diary completion period).  
The primary analysis will be performed bas ed on an analysis of covariance  model, including 
randomized treatment group and randomized stratification (ie, use of phosphodiesterase inhibitors 
at screening) as factors and basel ine weekly  frequency of  symptomatic RP attacks as a covariate. 
The treatment comparisons will be estimated together with th e 95% confidence interval and 
p-value. The site effect will be explored as necessary. For subjects in the mITT Population with 
interm ittent missingness during the baseline or double -blind intervals, multiple imputation will be 
used assuming data are missing at random; for those subjects with truncated follow -up, methods 
will be used assuming missingness is not at random.  
The primary ana lysis is formally based on a [ADDRESS_290784] Y, where X is 
the threshold that would be exceeded with 90% probability when the true difference between 
iloprost and placebo in the change in the weekly fre quency of symptomatic RP attacks from 
baseline is 6.65, and where Y is the threshold that would be exceeded with only 2.5% probability 
when the true difference between iloprost and placebo in the change in the weekly frequency of  
symptomatic  RP attacks fro m baseline is 0.  
Note that these categories based on the thresholds X and Y should not be interpreted as providing 
strict decision rules, but rather as guidelines that will be factored into a broader scientific  and 
clinical assessment of the benefit -to-risk profile of IV iloprost. This broader assessment will 
include consideration of safety, supportive efficacy endpoints, and relevant infor mation external 
to this study.  
Eicos Sciences, Inc.  
Clinical Study Protocol ES -201 
Confidential & Proprietary   
Version 4.0, 01 March 2019  11The decision guidelines for this study include the following:  
• If the difference betwee n iloprost and placebo in the mean change in the weekly frequency of 
symptomatic RP attacks from baseline is less than X, then iloprost is not plausibly more 
efficacious than placebo; its utility in this indication should be reconsidered unless the 
endpoin ts support further development.  
• If the difference between iloprost and placebo in the mean change in the weekly frequency of 
symptomatic RP attacks from baseline is between X and Y, then iloprost is plausibly more 
efficacious than placebo.  
• If the differenc e between iloprost and placebo in the mean change in the weekly frequency of 
symptomatic RP attacks from baseline is at least Y, then iloprost would be statistically 
significantly more effective than placebo, with the strength of evidence meeting the stand ard 
requirement of a 0.025 one -sided (0.05 two -sided) false -positive error rate.  
Sample size determination  
The study will enroll up to a maximum of [ADDRESS_290785] 
deviation of the change from baseline in the weekly frequency of symptoma tic Raynaud attacks 
and the sample size is 20 patients per arm, are as follows:  
1. Regarding the false -positive error rate of the screening procedure, if IV iloprost truly provides 
no improvement in the change from baseline in the weekly frequency of symptoma tic Raynaud 
attacks, then the probability of bringing IV iloprost forward to a Phase 3 study is 32%. 
However, there is only a 2.5% chance of reaching the false positive conclusion that IV iloprost 
provides a statistically significant improvement in efficac y relative to a placebo control.    
2. The false -negative error rate is low. If the true difference between IV iloprost and the placebo 
control groups in the change from baseline in the weekly frequency of symptomatic Raynaud 
attacks is 6.65, then there is on ly a 10% chance that IV iloprost would be discarded, and thus 
a 90% chance that it would be evaluated in a subsequent confirmatory Phase 3 study; 
furthermore, the probability that IV iloprost will have a statistically significant improvement 
in efficacy (a t one -sided p<0.025) relative to the placebo control is 21%.  
Exploratory  efficacy analysi s 
Descriptive analyses based on point estimates and confidence intervals will be used for 
exploratory endpoints.  
Analysis of p harmacokinetic s  
The PK Population will i nclude all subjects in the PK substudy who receive study drug and for 
whom at least [ADDRESS_290786] 1 value above the lower 
limit of quantification.

Geometric mean and geometric CV will also be used to summarize specific parameters.  
Additional PK/pharmacodynamic analysis may be performed as an exploratory analysis, if 
applicable.  
Analysi s of safety  
All safety analyses will be performed on the Safety Population. Subjects will be analyzed by [CONTACT_239621].  
Safety measures will be summarized descriptively. Qualitative variables will be summarized using 
counts and percentages by [CONTACT_239622]. A treatment -emergent adverse event 
(TEAE) is defined as an adverse event with a start date and time on or after the administration of 
study drug. Treatment -emergent adverse events will be summarized by [CONTACT_94198] (SOC) and preferred term. Tables will be provided for 
overall incidence and incidence by [CONTACT_239623], drug -related TEAEs, 
TEAEs  by [CONTACT_764], serious adverse events, and TEAEs leading to treatment 
discontinuation. Laboratory and vital signs parameters will be presented using descriptive 
statistics for observed values at each visit and changes from baseline, as appropriate.

Version 4.0, 01 March 2019  211 INTRODUCTION AND BACK GROUND INFORMATION  
1.1 Overview of Systemic Sclerosis  
Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a heterogeneous disease whose pathogenesis is characterized by 
3 hallmarks: small vessel vasculopathy, production of autoantibodies, and fibroblast dysfunction 
leading to increased deposition of extracellular matrix.[ADDRESS_290797] imates are fairly similar 
for Europe, the [LOCATION_002], Australia, and Argentina, suggesting a prevalence of 150  to 
300 cases per million with a lower prevalence noted in Scandinavia, Japan, the U nited Kingdom , 
Taiwan, and India.2 The data consistently re port prevalence estimates that equate to less than 
100,000 persons in the [LOCATION_002] .  
The clinical manifestations and the prognosis of SSc vary, with the majority of patients having 
skin thickening and variable involvement of cardiovascular, gastrointe stinal, musculoskeletal , and 
pulmonary systems.3 Subsets of SSc can be discerned, (eg, limited cutaneous  SSc, diffuse 
cutaneous  SSc, and without skin involvement  [sine SSc] ).1  
1.1.1 Raynaud’s Phenomenon  in Systemic Sclerosis  
Vascular dysfunction is one of the earliest manifestations of SSc and is thought to be a m ajor factor 
in its pathogenesis .4,5,6 Occlusive vasculopathy is the hallmark lesion of all forms of SSc and is 
seen in different organs involved, such as skin, lungs, kidneys, etc.7,8 
Raynaud’s phenomenon  (RP)  is the most common manifestation of vascular abnormalities in SSc 
and is a universal feature of SSc disease, affecting more than 95% of p atients.9,10,11  
Raynaud’s phenomenon  is characterized by [CONTACT_239624]. The distinctive features of RP include pain, 
numbness , tingling , and discoloration of digits due to vaso spasms  (typi[INVESTIGATOR_239598] ). Hand impairment is nearly universal in SSc patients. 
Raynaud’s phenomenon  secondary to SSc is also associated with significant disability  and 
psychological impact.[ADDRESS_290798] significant anxiety associated with their disease, often expressing fears  of digital 
ulcers  (DUs) and auto -amputation.  
1.1.2 Digital Ulcers  in Systemic Sclerosis  
Digital ulcers  are a frequent external manifestation of vasculopathy in SSc.13 Many factors are 
implicated in the pathogenesis of DUs in the setting of SSc. These include 1) impaired afferent 
vasomotion (highlighted by [CONTACT_239625]), 2) disrupted microvasculature 
including capi[INVESTIGATOR_239599], 3) leucocy te and platelet activation and adherence to injured 
endothelium , and 4) hemorhe ological alterations typi[INVESTIGATOR_239600].8 The disease is also character ized 
by [CONTACT_239626].14 
Eicos Sciences, Inc.  
Clinical Study Protocol ES -201 
Confidential & Proprietary   
Version 4.0, 01 March 2019  22Ischemic DUs are generally due to aberrant vasculopathy and usually occur on the pulp of the 
fingers.  Digital ulcers  are defined as a denuded area of d e-epi[INVESTIGATOR_239601].15 Ulcers can also 
occur over bony prominences such as proximal or metacarpophalangeal joints with 
well-demarcated borders and may be caused by [CONTACT_239627]. The majority of 
the published data has focused on ischemic DU s. Digital ulcers  occur in up to 58% of patients with 
limited or diffuse SSc and often occur early in the disease course.16,17,18 A 30% annual incidence 
of SSc DU s has been reported in the literature, suggesting ~20,000 adult patients experience DUs 
secondary  to SSc yearly in the [LOCATION_002]  (based on current U nited States Census data).[ADDRESS_290799] shown that the lesions heal slowly , lead to substantial pain and functional 
disability , and are associated with complications such as scarring, loss of distal tissue, infection, 
gangrene, and amputatio n. These symptoms lead to reduced quality of life, an increased frequency 
of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], and decreased survival.9,17,20,21 
1.1.3 Current Management of R aynaud’s Phenomenon  and D igital Ulcers  in Systemic 
Sclerosis  
Currently, there are no Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) approved therapi[INVESTIGATOR_239602] t RP or 
DUs secondary to SSc. Management of RP or DUs in SSc includes nonpharmacologic, 
pharmacologic, and surgical interventions. Multiple pharmacologic agents are used in clinical 
practice to counteract RP and prevent/reduce th e burden of DUs ( eg, calcium channel blockers, 
angiotensin receptor blockers, angiotensin -converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitors, alpha -adrenergic 
blockers, and serotonin inhibitors ), although many lack supportive data and none are approved for 
such use in the  [LOCATION_002]. Management of SSc vascular diseases includes vasodilators 
(including medications approved for pulmonary arterial hypertension  [PAH]  such as prostacyclin  
analogs, endothelin receptor  antagonists, phosphodiesterase -5 (PDE5) inhibitors, and so luble 
guanylate cyclase stimulators). Phosphodiesterase -5 inhibitors, prostacyclin  analogs (iloprost), 
and bosentan have been endorsed by [CONTACT_941] [ADDRESS_290800] Rheumatism 
(EULAR) recommendations for the treatment of SSc.[ADDRESS_290801], a stable analog of prostacyclin, has been used for over a decade as an inhaled formulation 
to treat PAH ( both within and outside of the [LOCATION_002])  and as an intravenous  (IV) formulation 
for occlusive arterial diseases ( outside of the United S tates) due to its pharmacological effects on 
vascular cells and platelets .25,[ADDRESS_290802] is a potent prostacyclin receptor (IP receptor) agonist. 
Pharmacology studies have shown that iloprost increases the cyclic adenosine monophosphate

Version 4.0, 01 March 2019  23(cAMP ) levels in human platelets of various species through stimulation of adenylate cyclase, 
leading to inhibition of platelet aggregation. In addition, iloprost has been shown to cause 
vasodilation through stimulation of the IP receptor on smooth muscle cells.  The commercially 
approved forms of iloprost (Ilomedin® and Ventavis®) consist of [ADDRESS_290803] 
in conformation of a methyl group at the carbon 16 position. The current commercial formulation 
uses a fixed racemic mixture of 16(S) and 16( R) diastereoisomers (47:53). The 16(S) is 
substantially more potent than the 16(R) in vasodilating and inhibiting collagen -induced platelet 
aggregation.  
1.2.[ADDRESS_290804] (Ventavis) in early 2004.  
Ventavis is indicated  for the treatment of PAH to improve a composite endpoint consisting of 
exercise tolerance, symptoms, and lack of deteri oration. Studies establishing effectiveness 
predominately included patients with N ew York Heart Association  Functional Class III  to IV 
symptoms and etiologies of idiopathic or heritable PAH (65%) or PAH associated with connective 
tissue diseases (23%).  
The IV formulation of iloprost was first approved in the early 1990s in Europe and has since 
received marketing approvals in 30 European and non -European countries under the tradename 
[CONTACT_239651]. The approved indications for Ilomedin in the E uropean Union include 1) treatment of 
patients with severe peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD), particularly those at risk of 
amputation and in whom surgery or angioplasty is not possible; 2) treatment of advanced 
thromboangitis obliterans (Buerger ’s disease) with critical limb isch emia in cases where 
revasculari zation is not indicated; 3) treatment of patients with severe disabling RP unresponsive 
to other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]; and 4) treatment of moderate or severe primary and secondary PAH, such as 
[LOCATION_001] Heart Associatio n functional classes III and IV.  
1.2.[ADDRESS_290805] for the Treatment of Symptomatic Raynaud’s Phenomenon 
Secondary  to Systemic Sclerosis  
Iloprost is a synthetic analog of prostacyclin. Iloprost may improve outcomes and restore function 
lost due to SS c by [CONTACT_239628], reducing microvascular inflammation, 
reducing/reversing fibrosis , and decreasing platelet aggregation.27,28,29,30,31,[ADDRESS_290806] has been suggested to possess antifibrotic 
effects, as it has been shown to prevent bleo mycin -induced fibrosis and reverse established right 
ventricular fibrosis in animal models.28,32

Pharmacokinetic  (PK)  studies have been conducted with iloprost in health y volunteers and in a 
variety of patient populations using different formulations and routes of admini stration. The PK 
and systemic exposures associated with these formulations and routes of administration are very 
well characterized in the literature. A vast majority of the clinical pharmacology and clinical 
studies published in the literature are with th e IV formulation of iloprost.  
In PK studies in animals, there was no evidence of interconversion of the [ADDRESS_290807] has a short half -life of 20 to 30 minutes  and has linear PK following IV administratio n at 
doses of 1 to 3 ng/kg/min . Approximately 60% of iloprost is bound to plasma protein (75% to 
albumin). The total plasma clearance of iloprost in healthy individuals is 20 m L/min/kg .[ADDRESS_290808] was pharmacologically inactive. 
Clearance in normal subjects was approximately 20 mL/mi n/kg. A mass -balance study using IV 
and orally administered [3H] -iloprost in healthy subjects (n=8) showed recovery of 81% of total 
radioactivity over 14 hours postdose, with 68% and 12% recoveries in urine and feces, 
respectively. In patients with liver c irrhosis, the mean clearance in Child -Pugh B subjects (n=5) 
was approximately 10 mL/min/kg. For p atients requiring intermittent dialysis (n=7) , the mean area 
under the plasma concentration time curve from time 0 to 4 hours was 230 pg*h/mL compared to 
54 pg *h/mL for patients with renal failure (n=8) not requiring intermittent dialysis and 48 pg*h/mL 
for normal  healthy volunteers . Dialysis did not affect iloprost plasma concentrations.[ADDRESS_290809] PK has been investigated  in patients suffering from renal insufficiency who are not on 
dialysis with serum creatinine >2  mg/d L and patients on dialysis.[ADDRESS_290810] dos ing regimen requires titration , so 
more careful titration should be co nsidered for patients with liver impairment. However, apart 
from a reduction of the starting dose (of approximately 50%) for titration, special 
recommendations are not necessary for patients with impaired liver function.[ADDRESS_290811] in SSc patients with RP and DUs.

A total of 131 patien ts ([ADDRESS_290822] and 67 placebo) enrolled and 126 successfully completed the 
5-day infusion. Of these, 114 patients ([ADDRESS_290823] and 58 placebo) completed at least 6 weeks of 
follow -up. A total of 17 patients ([ADDRESS_290824] and 9 placebo) withdrew from the stu dy. The patients 
receiving iloprost had a decreased RP severity score at Weeks 3, 6, and 9. The treatment difference 
was greater at Weeks 1 to 3 (p=0.006) and Weeks 4 to 6 (p=0.05) than at Weeks 7 to 9 (p=0.09). 
A comparison of the changes over the entire study period (Weeks 1 to 9) showed a greater mean 
decrease in the iloprost group ( -34.8%) than the placebo group (-19.7%) (p=0.01). In the subset of 
patients with digital cutaneous lesions at baseline, the mean decrease in RP severity score remained 
the sa me as those in the entire group given iloprost ( -34.5%), but the effect was less in those who 
received placebo in this subset ( -9.9%) (p=0.01).42

standard of care therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
The study will enroll a maximum of  [ADDRESS_290833] information regarding all symptomatic RP attacks (eg, severity of symptoms, 
duration, and hand function). The up to 30 -day screening period consists of a 5 -day eligibility 
period and an up to 25 -day baseline ePRO diary completion period:  
• During the [ADDRESS_290834] 3 separate days of the 5 -day 
eligibility period.  
• During the baseline ePRO diary completion perio d, eligible subjects must  complete the daily 
ePRO diary for a minimum of 10 days (up to a maximum of 25 days) until the day of 
randomization. It may be necessary to extend the baseline ePRO diary completion period 
beyond [ADDRESS_290835] concentrations using validated liquid chromatography mass spectrometry methods.  
Subjects will be randomized in a 1:[ADDRESS_290836] injection for IV use or placebo. 
Randomization will be stratified based on the use of phosphodiesterase  inhibitors at screening. 
Study drug administration will begin on Day 1, and subjects will receive study drug for 
5 consecutive days (eg, Monday through Friday) as an IV infusion over 6 hours each day via a 
peripheral line (NovaCath ™ Integrated IV Catheter System) or a peripherally inserted central 
catheter (PI[INVESTIGATOR_6875]) using an infusion  pump.  
Subjects must have a systolic bl ood pressure 85 mmHg (sitting position) prior to study drug 
administration  each day of administration . On Day 1, study drug will be initiated at a starting dose 
of 0.5 ng/kg/min, and dose increases will occur every 30 minutes ( 5 minutes) in increments of  
0.5 ng/kg/min up to 2.0 ng/kg/min or the individual tolerated dose. If dose -limiting adverse events 
(eg, headache, flushing, jaw pain, myalgia, nausea, or vomiting) occur that cannot be tolerated by 
[CONTACT_423], then the dose will be reduced in a step wis e manner by 0.5 ng/kg/min every 30 minutes 
(5 minutes), until a tolerated dose is determined. If symptomatic hypotension or a dose -limiting

Version 4.0, [ADDRESS_290837] at the starting dose (ie, 0.5 ng/kg/min), the 
infusion will be reduced to 0.25 ng/kg/min. If the dose of 0.25 ng/kg/min is not tolerated due to 
symptomatic hypotension or a dose -limiting adverse event occurs , the study drug will be 
discontinued and reinitiation of the infusion can be attempted after the event has r esolved or been 
treated. Blood pressure and heart rate will be monitored 15 minutes ( 5 minutes) prior to and after 
all dose changes. If the subject experiences symptomatic hypotension or any other adverse event 
that cannot be tolerated, as determined by t he Investigator, during administration of study drug, 
the dose will be reduced or the infusion will be stopped until the symptoms resolve, at which point 
the study drug should be reinitiated at a previously tolerated dose. The maximum tolerated dose 
will b e maintained for the remaining 6 -hour daily period. At the end of the 6 -hour infusion period, 
the dose will be stopped. Subjects will be monitored for up to 1 hour after completion of study 
drug infusion (ie, vital signs will be obtained 15 minutes [ 5 minutes] and 1 hour [ 15 minutes] 
after completion of the infusion).

(pain, numbness, tingli ng, and/or discomfort) using an 11 -point NRS.  
Intensity will be assessed as follows: 0 = no pain/numbness/tingling/discomfort, 1  to 3 = mild 
pain/numbness/tingling/discomfort, 4 to 6 = moderate pain/numbness/tingling/discomfort, and 
7 to 10 = severe pain/ numbness/tingling/discomfort.

The Raynaud’s Condition Score asks subjects to rate their difficulty with Raynaud’s condition on 
a given day from “No difficulty (0)” to “Extreme difficulty (10).” Subjects will be asked to 
consider t he number of attacks they have had on that day and how long each attack lasted. Subjects 
will also be asked to consider how much pain, numbness, or other symptoms the Raynaud’s caused 
in their fingers (including painful sores) and how much the Raynaud’s al one affected the use of 
their hands that day.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Cochin Hand Function Scale  
Raynaud’s phenomenon attacks have a significant impact on hand function.12 The CHFS is an

8.1 Adverse Events  
Since symptomatic RP attacks (as defined in Section 7.2.1 ) are recorded as efficacy assessments, 
these will not be treated as adverse events. However, if an event results in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_239605], the event will then be reported as an SAE. I f subjects have non -RP-related pain during 
a symptomatic RP attack, that event w ill be captured as an adverse event.  
An adverse event is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject 
administered a pharmaceutical product, which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with 
this treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfav orable and/or unintended sign 
(including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the 
use of an investigational medicinal product, whether or not related to the investigational medicinal 
product. All adverse events, i ncluding observed or volunteered problems, complaints, or 
symptoms, are to be recorded on the appropriate eCRF . 
All adverse events, which include clinical laboratory test variables, will be monitored and 
documented from  the time of informed consent  until Day 35. During study drug infusions (Day 1 
to Day 5) treatment -emergent adverse events ( TEAEs ) are expected  (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] ). 
Treatment -emergent adverse events should be captured in relation to the dose, dose rate, and/or 
need for dose reduction. Subjects should be instructed to report any adverse event that they 
experience to the Investigator , whether or not they think the event is due to study treatment. 
Beginning at screening until Day 35, Investigators should make an assessment for adverse events 
at each visit and record the event on the appropriate adverse eve nt eCRF.   
Wherever possible, a specific disease or syndrome rather than individual associated signs and 
symptoms should be identified by [CONTACT_239636]. However, if an 
observed or reported sign or symptom is not considered a comp onent of a specific disease or 
syndrome by [CONTACT_737] , it should be recorded as a separate adverse event on the eCRF. 
Additionally, the condition that led to a medical or surgical procedure ( eg, surgery, endoscopy, 
tooth extraction, or transfusion) s hould be recorded as an adverse event, not the procedure  itself .  
Any medical condition already present at screening  should be recorded as medical history and not 
be reported as an adverse event , unless the medical condition or signs or symptoms present at  
baseline change in severity , frequency,  or seriousness at any time during the study. In this case, it 
should be reported as an adverse event.  
Clinically significant abnormal laboratory or other examination ( eg, ECG ) findings that are 
detected during the s tudy or are present at the date of screening  and significantly worsen during 
the study should be reported as adverse event s, as described below . The Investigator  will exercise 
his or her medical and scientific judgment in deciding whether an abnormal laboratory finding or 
other abnormal assessment is clinically significant. Clinically significant abnormal laboratory 
values occurring during the clinical study will be followed until repeat tests return to normal, 
stabilize, or are no longer clinically significant. Abnormal test results that are determined to be an 
error should not be reported as an adverse event.

Version 4.0, 01 March 2019  47Laboratory abnormalities or other abnormal clinical f indings (eg, ECG  abnormalities) should be 
reported as an adverse event if any of the following are applicable:  
• If an intervention is required as a result of the abnormality  
• If action take n with study drug is required as a result of the abnormality  
• Based on  the clinical judgment of the Investigator  
8.1.1 Adverse (Drug) Reaction  
All noxious and unintended responses to a medicinal product related to any dose should be 
considered an adverse drug reaction. “Responses” to a medicinal product means that a causal 
relatio nship between a medicinal product and an adverse event is at least a reasonable possibility, 
ie, the relationship cannot be ruled out.  
8.1.[ADDRESS_290874] information.  
8.1.3 Assessment of Adverse Events by [CONTACT_239637] (intensity) of each adverse event as mild, moderate, or 
severe, and will also categorize e ach adverse event as to its potential relationship to study drug 
using the categories of yes or no.  
Assessment of severity  
Mild – An event that is easily tolerated , causing minimal discomfort,  and generally not interfering 
with normal daily activities.  
Mod erate – An event that is sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal daily activities.  
Severe – An event that is incapacitating with inability to work or perform normal daily activities.  
Causality assessment  
The relationship of an adverse event to the administration of the study drug is to be assessed 
according to the following definitions:  
No (unrelated, not related, unlikely to be related ) – The time course between the administration of 
study drug and the occurrence or worsening of the adverse eve nt rules out a causal relationship 
and another cause (concomitant drugs, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], complications, etc .) is suspected.  
Yes ( possibly, probably, or definitely related ) – The time course between the administration of 
study drug and the occurrence or worsening of the adverse event is consistent with a causal 
relationship and no other cause (concomitant drugs, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], complications, etc.) can be 
identified.  
The definit ion implies a reasonable  possibility of a causal relationship between the event and the 
study drug. This means that there are facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship.

• The temporal sequ ence from study drug administration - 
The event should occur after the study drug is given. The length of time from study drug 
exposure to event should be evaluated in the clinical context of the event.  
• Underlying, concomitant, intercurrent diseases - 
Each r eport should be evaluated in the context of the natural history and course of the disease 
being treated and any other disease the subject may have.  
• Concomitant drug - 
The other drugs the subject is taking or the treatment the subject receives should be exam ined 
to determine whether any of them might be recognized to cause the event in question.  
• Known response pattern for this class of study drug - 
Clinical and/or preclinical data may indicate whether a particular response is likely to be a 
class effect.  
• Expos ure to physical and/or mental stresses - 
The exposure to stress might induce adverse changes in the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_23567] a logical and 
better explanation for the event.  
• The pharmacology and PK of the study drug - 
The known pharmacologic properties (absorpti on, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) of 
the study drug should be considered.

• A persistent or significant disability/incapacity or substanti al disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions . 
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect . 
• An important medical event.  
o Note: Important medical events that do not meet any of the above criteria  may be 
considered an SAE when, based upon appropriate me dical judgment, they may jeopardize 
the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes 
listed above. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring 
intensive treatment in an emergency room o r at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that 
do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], or the development of drug dependency.

9.1 Analysis Populations  
9.1.1 Modified Intent -to-Treat Population  
The modified Intent -to-Treat (mITT) Population is defined as all randomized subjects who initiate 
infusion of study drug. The mITT Population is the primary efficacy analysis population.  
9.1.2 Per-Protocol Population  
The Per -Protocol (PP) Population is defined as all subjects in the mITT Population who complete 
at least Day  [ADDRESS_290887] 
and to inform the design and logistics of future studies.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Primary efficacy analysis  
The baseline weekly frequency of symptomatic RP attacks is defined as the average number of 
weekly symptomatic RP attacks occurring during the 10 - to 25 -day baseline ePRO diary 
completion period. The double -blind weekly symptomatic RP attacks is defined as the average 
number of weekly symptomatic RP a ttacks during Days 8 to 21. The primary efficacy parameter 
is the change in the weekly frequency of symptomatic RP attacks from baseline (ie, the mean 
number of weekly symptomatic RP attacks during Days 8 to 21 compared to during the 
10- to 25-day baseline  ePRO diary completion period).  
The primary analysis will be performed based on an analysis of covariance model, including 
randomized treatment group and randomized stratification (ie, use of phosphodiesterase inhibitors 
at screening) as factors and baseli ne weekly frequency of symptomatic RP attacks as a covariate. 
The treatment comparisons will be estimated together with th e 95% confidence interval and 
p-value. The site effect will be explored as necessary. For subjects in the mITT Population with 
intermi ttent missingness during the baseline or double -blind intervals, multiple imputation will be 
used assuming data are missing at random; for those subjects with truncated follow -up, methods 
will be used assuming missingness is not at random.  
The primary anal ysis will be performed on the mITT Population. Sensitivity analyses for the 
primary endpoint will include comparable analyses performed on the PP Population.  
The primary analysis is formally based on a [ADDRESS_290888] and placebo in the mean change in the weekly frequency of

the threshold that would be exceeded with 90% probability when the true difference between

baseline is 6.65, and where Y is the threshold that would be exceeded with only 2.5% probability 
when the true difference between iloprost and placebo in the change in the weekly frequency of 
symptomatic RP attacks from baseline is 0.  
Note that these categories based on the thresholds X and Y should not be interpreted as providing 
strict decision rules , but rather as guidelines that will be factored into a broader scientific and 
clinical assessment of the benefit -to-risk profile of IV ilopro st. This broader assessment will 
include consideration of safety, supportive efficacy endpoints, and relevant information external 
to this study.  
The decision guidelines for this study include the following:  
• If the difference between iloprost and placebo in the mean change in the weekly frequency of 
symptomatic RP attacks from baseline is less than X, then iloprost is not pla usibly more 
efficacious than  placebo; its utility in this indication should be reconsidered unless the 
endpoints support further deve lopment.  
• If the difference between iloprost and placebo in the mean change in the weekly frequency of 
symptomatic RP attacks from baseline is between X and Y, then iloprost is plausibly more 
efficacious than placebo.  
• If the difference between iloprost and placebo in the mean change in the weekly frequency of 
symptomatic RP attacks from baseline is at least Y, then iloprost would be statistically 
significantly more effective than placebo, with the strength of evidence meeting the standard 
requirement of a 0. 025 one -sided (0.05 two -sided) false -positive error rate.  
The study (and other information that emerges during the conduct of this study) will provide 
important insights through consideration of the following:  
• Estimated benefit -to-risk profile of IV ilopr ost 
• Possible refinements in the dose/schedule of IV iloprost  
• Approaches to improve adherence to the IV iloprost regimen  
• Modifications to defining eligibility criteria to enhance enrichment  
• Approaches to achieving timely accrual of study participants at cen ters with the established 
ability to provide high quality implementation of the study  
• Modifications to the use of an electronic diary to collect patient reported outcome data

1. Regardi ng the false -positive error rate of the screening procedure, if IV iloprost truly provides 
no improvement in the change from baseline in the weekly frequency of symptomatic Raynaud 
attacks, then the probability of bringing IV iloprost forw ard to a Phase 3 trial is 32%. However, 
there is only a 2.5% chance of reaching the false positive conclusion that IV iloprost provides 
a statistically significant improvement in efficacy relative to a placebo control.    
2. The false -negative error rate is low. If the true d ifference between IV iloprost and the placebo 
control groups in the change from baseline in the weekly frequency of symptomatic Raynaud 
attacks is 6.65, then there is only a 10% chance that IV iloprost would be discarded, and thus 
a 90% chance that it woul d be evaluated in a subsequent confirmatory Phase 3 study ; 
furthermore, the probability that IV iloprost will have a statistically significant improvement 
in efficacy (at one -sided p<0.025) relative to the placebo control is 21%.

eCRFs and procedures for their completion, informed consent process, a nd the procedure for 
reporting SAEs.  
The Investigator will permit the Sponsor  or their designee to monitor the study as frequently as 
deemed necessary to determine that data recording and protocol adherence are satisfactory. During 
the monitoring visits, i nformation recorded on the eCRFs will be verified against source 
documents and requests for clarification or correction may be made. After the eCRF data  are 
entered by [CONTACT_779], the CRA will review the data for safety information, completeness, accuracy, 
and logical consistency. Computer programs that identify data inconsistencies may be used to help 
monitor the clinical study. If necessary, requests for clarification or correction will be sent to 
Investigators. The Investigator and his/her staff will be ex pected to cooperate with the CRA  and 
provide any missing information, whenever possible.

records, eg, eCRFs and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097]), all original signed ICFs , copi[INVESTIGATOR_64349], SAE  forms, 
source documents, and detailed records of treatment disposition. The records should be retained 
by [CONTACT_239648] I CH guidelines, local regulations, or as 
specified in the Clinical Study Agreement, whichever is longer. The Investigator  must obtain 
written permission from the Sponsor  before disposing of any records, even if retention 
requirements have been met.  
If the Investigator  relocates, retires, or for any reason withdraws from the study, the Sponsor  should 
be prospectively notified. The study records must be transferred to an acceptable designee, such 
as another Investigator , another institution, or to the Sponsor .

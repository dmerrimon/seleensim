Administration of IP for which expanded access for treatment use 
(“compassionate use”) has been authorized (eg, convalescent plasma) is also permitted  during study participation. 
The study consists of a Screening Period of up to 2 days, and a Treatment Period of up to 28 days. 
Aggregate data from groups of subjects will be reviewed by [CONTACT_140954] (IDMC), both early and at predetermined intervals during the conduct of the study. 
For futility monitoring and sample size re -estimation, an interim 
analysis of unblinded primary endpoint data is planned after 
62 subjects (50% of the target sample size) have completed primary endpoint assessment. 
Primary Objective  The primary objective of the study is to assess the treatment benefit 
of CSL312 after intravenous (IV) infusion in patients with COVID-19. 
Primary Endpoint  The primary endpoint is the incidence of tracheal intubation or death prior to tracheal intubation from randomization to Day 28. 
Secondary 
Objectives  The secondary objectives of the study are: 
• To further assess the efficacy of CSL312 
• To assess the safety of CSL312  
• To assess the pharmacokinetics (PK) of CSL312

1.1 Background  
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by a new coronavirus strain of severe acute 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_6507]- 2 (SARS -CoV-2). According to the World Health 
Organization (WHO), the virus emerged in Wuhan, China [ WHO  Disease Outbreak News, 
2020]. Since the first reports in December 2019, SARS-CoV-2 has spread rapi[INVESTIGATOR_750356] [ WHO  COVID-19 Situation Report 65, 2020]. 
Symptoms elicited by [CONTACT_7544] -CoV-[ADDRESS_1027320] patients display a mild form of illness, a subset of infected individuals (~14%) develop 
severe disease, viral pneumonia, leading to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_750357], 
with approximately 5% of these patients requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission 
[Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia Emergency Response Epi[INVESTIGATOR_750358] ( NCPERE Team ), 
2020]. In severe cases, COVID -19 may be complicated by [CONTACT_171958][INVESTIGATOR_13086] (ARDS), sepsis and septic shock, multi-organ failure, and even death [ Yang  et al, 
2020]. Risk factors associated with severe disease are age > 65 years and underlying comorbidities, such as obesity, diabetes mellitus, and other chronic disorders. 
Emerging radiological evidence suggests that patients with COVID-19 pneumonia present 
with thoracic computed tomography (CT) imaging abnormalities [ Shi et al, 2020]. The 
predominant pattern reported is ground- glass opacity, with ill-defined margins, air 
bronchograms, smooth or irregular interlobular or septal thickening, and thickening of the adjacent pleura. CT  scan abnormalities appear to evolve from focal unilateral to diffuse 
bilateral ground-glass opacities and may progress to or co-exist with consolidations within 
[ADDRESS_1027321] abnormalities are observed even in patients with 
mild symptoms. Overall, the reported imaging characteristics bear resemblance to those 
observed for other coronavirus infections, such as severe acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_7686] (SARS) and Middle East respi[INVESTIGATOR_7686] (MERS), and are suggestive of vascular leakage and 
fluid accumulation in the lung tissue.

Effective Date: Week commencing [ADDRESS_1027322] scan abnormalities that were 
associated with leukocytopenia and lymphopenia [ Huang et  al, 2020 ]. At the time of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_15517], increased prothrombin time (PT) and D-dimer levels have been observed in 
patients that are eventually admitted to the ICU. Preliminary evidence f urther suggests that 
the non-survivors, at the time of admission, had higher levels of D-dimer and fibrin 
degradation product, longer PT, and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) compared with survivors [ Tang  et al, 2020] During their hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7959], 71.4% of non-survivors and 
0.6% of survivors met the criteria for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Together, these data suggest that severe CO VID-[ADDRESS_1027323] that intrinsic activation may also play a 
role. Lastly, analysis of immune mediators in plasma showed increased concentrations of 
interleukin (IL)-2, IL- 7, IL -10, granulocyte colony- stimulating factor (G -CSF), interferon 
gamma -induced protein 10 ( IP-10), monocyte chemoattractant protein- 1 (MCP -1), 
macrophage inflammatory protein  1-alpha (MIP -1α), and tumor necrosis factor- alpha 
(TNF -α) in ICU patients compared with non- ICU patients [ Huang et  al, 2020].  
Similar to SAR S-CoV , the functional ligand of SARS-CoV-2 is angiotensin-converting 
enzyme- 2 (ACE -2). Binding of SARS- CoV to ACE -2 has been reported to downmodulate 
ACE -2 expression. In addition to its role in the renin–angiotensin system, ACE -2 inactivates 
des-Arg9 brad ykinin (DABK), a potent vasodilative, vascular leakage, and proinflammatory 
mediator. Hence, we postulate that dysregulated ACE -2-dependent inactivation of DABK 
contributes to vascular leakage, fluid accumulation, and excessive tissue inflammation in 
COVID-19. 
Coagulation factor XII (FXII) is the principal initiator of the plasma contact [CONTACT_750374]. 
Upon contact [CONTACT_750375]-charged surfaces, FXII is converted to activated coagulation factor  XII (FXIIa), leading to the production of bradykinin (BK) through the kallikrein-kinin 
pathway. Binding of BK to BK receptor type 2 and DABK to BK receptor type 1 activates various intracellular signaling pathways that dilate vessels, induce chemotaxis of neutrophils, and increase vascular permeability and fluid efflux. Further cleavage of FXIIa releases the light chain containing activated beta coagulation factor XII (β FXIIa), which can activate the 
classical complement pathway. Independent of kallikrein -kinin system (KKS) and 
complement activation, FXII induces expression of inflammatory mediators, including IL-8, IL-1β, and IL-6 on human fibroblasts and precision cut lung slices.

hemostasis at a site of injury. Specifically, patients with congenital deficiency of FXII do not 
exhibit a bleeding phenotype. Similarly, FXII knockout mice and rats maintain normal hemostasis despi[INVESTIGATOR_750359]. Taken together, these findings show that FXII has potent proinflammatory and procoagulant activities. 
To date, no targeted treatment for the COVID- [ADDRESS_1027325] evidence, such as excessive fluid 
accumulation, DIC, and the observed cytokine storm may implicate this molecule in 
COVID-19. Of note, endothelial cell permeability during Hantavirus infection involved FXII-dependent activation of the KKS, implicating FXII in the pathobiology of viral 
infections [ Taylor  et al, 2013].  
We hypothesize that FXII inhibition attenuates progression of SARS-CoV-2- related 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_750360]. Specifically, we hypothesize that 
FXII-targeted interventions will attenuate vascular leakage and expression of inflammatory 
mediators through inhibition of KKS-dependent BK generation. We further postulate that 
FXII inhibition will have a beneficial effect on DIC through attenuation of intrinsic coagulation-driven thrombosis. 
According to feedback from treating physicians, in patients with disease progression, the time 
period from symptoms onset to development of dyspnea is reported to be between 
5 to 10 days, and progression to severe leukocytopenic or lymphocytopenic pneumonia with 
or without ARDS occurs within 10 to  14 days. An estimated 15% to  18% of these patients 
will need mechanical ventil ation, despi[INVESTIGATOR_750361]-invasive ventilation (NIV) support in 
the earliest phases of the disease. The probability of progression to end- stage disease is 
unpredictable, with the majority of these patients dying from multi-organ failure. Preventing disease progression to avoid the need for mechanical ventilation in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia should reduce morbidity and mortality and result in a decrease in the 
use of healthcare resources, ie,  the need for mechanical ventilation and prolonge d ICU stay.

CSL312 is a fully human immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4)/lambda, FXIIa antagonist, recombinant 
monoclonal antibody. CSL312 binds to the catalytic domain of FXIIa and potently inhibits 
the intrinsic coagulation cascade and BK production via inhibition of KKS [ Cao et al, 2018]. 
Based on available nonclinical data, CSL312 may offer a novel therapeutic approach to 
prevent disease progression in patients with COVID -19. 
CSL312 is a potent antithrombotic antibody in both mouse and rabbit thrombosis models 
involving FXII activation (without bleeding risk in either thrombosis or bleeding models). 
Pharmacologically, CSL312 treatment is accompanied by [CONTACT_750376] [ Larsson  et al, 2014]. CSL312 inhibits BK production in vitro and 
attenuates edema formatio n in vivo in BK- mediated edema models (ACE -inhibitor induced 
edema and acute anaphylaxis mouse models) [ Cao et al, 2018]. CSL312 attenuates 
expression of inflammatory mediators. The parental antibody to CSL312, 3F7, attenuates bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis, renal fibrosis in a unilateral ureteral obstruction model, and 
liver fibrosis in mice. Based on available nonclinical data, CSL312 might offer a novel 
therapeutic approach to prevent disease progression in patients with COVID-19. 
1.[ADDRESS_1027326]- of-care (SOC) treatment in patients 
with COVID-19. The study will consist of a Screening Period of up to 2 days and a 
Treatment Period of up to 28 days. Eligible subjects will be randomly assigned to receive a 
single intravenous (IV) dose of either CSL312 or placebo in addition to SOC trea tment 
(CSL312 + SOC or placebo + SOC) on Day  1. The primary endpoint for this study is the 
incidence of tracheal intubation or death prior to tracheal intubation from randomization to 
Day 28. A more detailed overview of the study is provided in Section  3. 
1.4 Potential Risks and Benefits  
CSL312 is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits FXIIa activity. CSL312 is currently being developed for routine prophylaxis to prevent angioedema attacks in patients 
with hereditary angioedema  (HAE). In the current study, CSL312 will be administered for the 
first time to subjects with COVID -19 with the aim of preventing disease progression (ie, the 
need for tracheal intubation or death).

Effective Date: Week commencing 30 -Apr-2018   Page 28 of 83 CSL312 is currently only administered in the clinical study setting in accordance with the 
clinical study protocol (CSP). The maximum dose and the predicted corresponding maximum plasma concentration (C
max) in this study is e qual  to the highest administered dose and its 
corresponding C max observed in the phase 1 study (CSL312_1001). Each subject who 
participated in Study CSL312_1001 received a single dose of CSL312; each subject who participates in the current study will recei ve a single dose of either CSL312 in addition to 
SOC treatment (CSL312  + SOC) or placebo in addition to SOC treatment (placebo + SOC).  
Benefits  
The benefits of CSL312, when provided in addition to SOC treatment, in patients with COVID-19 are unknown. Potential benefits are based on the mechanism of action of CSL312, ie, inhibition of FXIIa. The potential benefit is the prevention of disease progression 
in patients with COVID -19. Subjects randomly assigned to the placebo + SOC group, which 
is included for scientific rigor, are not expected to receive any additional benefits from 
placebo beyond the expected response to SOC treatment.  
Risks  
The following risks were not observed in the phase 1 study (CSL312_1001) but are potential risks based on the drug class and mechanism of action of CSL312: 
• Severe Hypersensitivity/Anaphylactic -type Reactions:  Administration of 
therapeutic proteins including monoclonal antibodies such as CSL312 is associated 
with the risk of hypersensitivity and anaphylactic reactions, some of which can be 
serious and life-threatening. Appropriate precautions will be taken when CSL312 is 
administered at the study site, with constant monitoring for potential anaphylactic reactions. The administration of CSL312 will be performed under medical supervision 
with immediate access to emergency equipment and medication for the treatment of 
severe hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis. 
• Exacerbation of Cytokine Release Syndrome:  Cytokine release syndrome is a 
symptom complex caused by [CONTACT_750377]-inflammatory cytokines from 
target immune cells which can be life -threatening [ Stebbings  et al, 2007; Stebbings  
et al, 2013]. Patients with severe COVID -[ADDRESS_1027327] an evolving cytokine 
release syndrome at the time of ICU admission. The administration of CSL312 will be 
performed under constant medical supervision and cytokine levels will be tested 
before and after dosing.

Version Number: 1.0  
Effective Date: Week commencing 30 -Apr-2018   Page 29 of 83 • Bleeding and Thromboembolic Events:  By [CONTACT_458776]312, there may 
be a potential risk of bleeding or thromboembolic events (TEEs) due to altered 
hemostasis, unstable clot formation, or impaired clot breakdown. In addition, because of the pharmacological action of CSL312, a prolongation of aPTT is expected to be 
observed in a concentration-dependent manner. Clinical experience with CSL312 in 
healthy volunteers in the phase  1 study (CSL312_1001) and patients with HAE in the 
ongoing phase 2 study (CSL312_2001) did not show an effect on PT. This is 
consistent with the observation that patients who have congenital deficiency of FXII 
do not exhibit a bleeding phenotype, despi[INVESTIGATOR_79615] a prolonged aPTT [ Lammle  et al, 
1991; Ratnoff  and Colopy, 1955]. In addition, nonclinical studies in mice and rabbits 
showed no impairment in hemostasis after inhibition of FXIIa [ Larsson  et al, 2014]. 
Currently, there is also no human experience with the administration of CSL312 in combination with other anticoagulant drugs. Coagulation parameters will be monitored throughout the study and subjects will be monitored carefully for any signs of bleeding or thrombosis. 
• Immunogenicity (Anti -drug Antibodies) : All protein  therapeutics are potentially 
immunogenic. Because CSL312 is a protein, it has the potential to cause the development of neutralizing and non- neutralizing anti -drug antibodies (ADAs). 
Subjects will be monitored for the development of immunogenicity throughout the study. 
Given the potential benefit of CSL312 in patients with COVID- 19, the favorable safety data 
from the phase 1 study (CSL312_1001) and the ongoing phase 2 study (CSL312_2001), and the implementation of procedures in the current study to closely monitor subject safety, the 
associated benefit -risk assessment is considered acceptable. Additional information on 
CSL312 can be found in the CSL312 Investigator’s Brochure.

Study data will be provided to the IDMC as unblinded data, as requested. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Breaking the Blind for an Emergency  
The randomization code for individual subjects may be unblinded to a site during the study in emergency situations for reasons of subject safety, if knowing treatment assignment will change subject management. In case of an emergency situation for the reason of subject 
safety, the investigator should use the IRT to identify the treatment allocation for a subject. 
Whenever possible, the investigator should consult with CSL before unblinding the randomization code. The reason for unblinding the randomization code must be fully recorded in the subject’s source documents, and the investigator must follow the defined 
procedures provided i n the study reference manuals. The subject’s treatment allocation 
should not be recorded in the subject’s source document. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Planned Unblinding Procedures  
Periodic unblinding safety reviews are planned for this study for the purposes of safety monitoring activities by [CONTACT_31849]. With authorization by [CONTACT_254815], the IRT will provide the 
unblinded statistician performing analysis for the IDMC or the unblinded statistician with the randomization code or an IRT user account access to obtain the required information dire ctly 
from the IRT.

Effective Date: Week commencing 30 -Apr-2018   Page 41 of 83 An unblinded interim futility and sample size re -estimation analysis will also be performed 
by [CONTACT_41774]. With authorization by [CONTACT_254815], the IRT will provide the unblinded statistician 
performing the analysis for the IDMC with the randomizatio n code or an IRT user account 
access to obtain the required information directly from the IRT. 
At the end of the study, CSL will authorize that the study be unblinded after database lock. 
The randomization codes will be provided to the study statistician ( or delegate).  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Ad-hoc Safety Unblinding  
CSL Global Clinical Safety Pharmacovigilance personnel may, on an ad-hoc basis, unblind 
the randomization code directly in the IRT at any time during the study because of a safety concern. The purpose of the unblinded data review is to determine whether there is a risk to 
subject safety that would require further action either for the individual management of a 
study subject or for the ongoing conduct of the study. The need to unblind a subject or group of subjects may  not necessarily arise because of an SAE. The need to unblind on an ad- hoc 
basis will be determined by [CONTACT_254815]’s Global Clinical Safety and Pharmacovigilance senior 
leadership.  
[ADDRESS_1027342] eligibility should be reviewed and documented by [CONTACT_254831]’s study team before subjects are included in the study. Eligibility may be assessed at the time of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_750362] [ADDRESS_1027343] meet all of the following inclusion criteria:  
1. Capable of providing written informed consent. An individual legally permitted to make medical decisions on the subject’s behalf can provide written informed consent

• The SMT will conduct a safety assessment of the relevant safety observation to 
establish whether the study should be resumed or whether the temporary halt should continue and will further escalate to the Global Safety Committee  
• If additional risk -benefit measures are warranted and modifications to the protocol are 
required to resume the study (including the addition of new risk mitigation measures), 
then a substantial protocol amendment will be submitted  
• Regulatory authorities and Institutional Review Boards (IRBs)/Independent Ethics 
Committees (IECs) will be informed of a study halt and then its resumption  
If safety concerns warrant a PERMANENT  stop to the study: 
• The SMT will conduct a risk assessment  
• The SMT and Global Safety Committee are i nvolved in recommending a stop, if it is 
has concluded that continued dosing poses an unacceptable risk to subjects and no 
further risk mitigation steps can be applied 
• CSL’s Global Benefit Risk Committee will ratify the decision to stop the study  
• In case d ecision to stop study is not ratified, GBRC could recommend study 
continuation with implementation of additional risk -benefit measures (including 
addition of new risk mitigation measures); substantial protocol amendment will be submitted if modifications a re required to continue the study

Childbearing potential is assumed in all female  subjects except:  
• Female subjects ages > 45  years with amenorrhea for ≥ 12 months without an 
alternative medical cause.  
• Female subjects who are surgically sterile for ≥ 3 months before providing informed 
consent. 
Acceptable methods of contraception are: 
• Abstinence, where abstinence is the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject, 
including refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk 
associated with the IP. Periodic abstinence (calendar, symptothermal, and 
post-ovulation methods), withdrawal (coitus interruptus), spermicides only, and 
lactational amenorrhea method are not acceptable definitions of abstinence.  
• Hormonal methods associated with inhibition of ovulation, if used at a stable dose 
during the 3 months before Screening with no plans to change dose during the study. 
Acceptable hormonal methods include: oral contraceptives, contraceptive medication 
patch, contraceptive medication injection, estrogen/progestin vaginal ring, or 
contraceptive medication implant.  
• Use of intr auterine device (placed > 3 months before providing informed consent). 
• Surgical sterilization (>  3 months before providing informed consent) of subject or 
subject's partner. 
9.4 Overdose  
Overdose is defined as the infusion or ingestion of any dose (single or cumulative) of a product that is considered excessive. In this study, excessive is defined as any dose greater than the planned dose. The effects of any potential overdose with CSL312 have not been 
studied. In case of overdose, the subject should be closely monitored, and supportive 
treatment should be administered, as needed.

10.1 Definitions 
10.1.1  Adverse Event  
As per ICH  E2A (Clinical Safety Data Management: Definitions and Standards for Expedited 
Reporting), an AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation 
subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal 
relationship with this treatment. An AE can, therefore, be any unfavorable and unintended 
sign (including an abnormal, clinically significant laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal (investigational) product. 
The period of observation for AEs extends from the time that informed consent is obtained 
until the EOS  Visit (see Section  10.4 for further details).  
Adverse events may include: 
• Exacerbation (ie,  an increase in the frequency or severity) of a pre -existing condition. 
Illness present before study entry should be recorded in the medical history section of 
the eCRF and only be reported as an AE if there is an increase in the frequency or 
severity of the condition during the study. 
• A clinical event occurring after consent but before IP administration. 
• Intercurrent illnesses with an onset after administration of IP. 
Adverse events do not include: 
• Events identified at Screening that meet exclusion criteria.  
• Medical or surgical procedures (the condition that leads to the procedure is the AE). 
• Situations where an untoward medical occurrence has not taken place. For example:  
o Planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_254785]-existing conditions, which have not worsened. 
o Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_254786] (eg, cosmetic 
surgery). 
o Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5315] a diagnostic procedure where the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_254787] 24 hours in duration or for normal management procedures (eg, chemotherapy).

Effective Date: Week commencing 30 -Apr-2018   Page 55 of 83 • Overdose of IP or any concomitant therapy that does not result in any adverse signs or 
symptoms. 
For laboratory safety parameters, any instanc es of absolute values being outside the reference 
range or changes at any visit after study start that are considered by [CONTACT_750379]. In addition, at the investigator’s 
discretion, any changes or trends over time in laboratory parameters can be recorded in the eCRF as AEs if such changes or trends are considered to be clinically relevant, even if the 
absolute values are within the reference range.  
Laboratory findings do not need to be reported as AEs in the following cases: 
• Increases in aPTT will not be classified as AEs because CSL312 is expected to cause increase in these parameters.  
• Laboratory parameters already beyond the reference range at Screening, unless a further increase/decrease can be considered an exacerbation of a pre -existing 
condition.  
• Abnormal laboratory parameters caused by [CONTACT_285068] (eg, in  vitro hemolysis) and flagged as such by [CONTACT_254845]. 
• Abnormal parameters that are obviously biologically implausible (eg, values that are incompatible with life or outside the measuring range). 
• An abnormal laboratory value that cannot be confirmed after repeat analysis, preferably in the same laboratory (ie, the previous result could be marked as not valid 
and should not necessarily be reported as an AE). 
10.1.[ADDRESS_1027358] medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in death – The event must be the cause of death for the SAE to meet this 
serious criterion. 
• Is life -threatening  – The term “life -threatening” refers to an event in which the 
subject was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that 
hypothetically might have caused death if it had been more severe.

CSL considers “hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]” for 
≥ 24 hours as the defining criterion for an SAE. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_489199] (eg,  chemotherapy) are not 
considered as defining criteria for SAEs. 
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity . 
• Is a congenital an omaly or birth defect.  
• Is medically significant  – A medically significant event is defined as an event that 
does not necessarily meet any of the SAE criteria, but which is judged by a physician 
to potentially jeopardize the subject or require medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent one of the above outcomes listed as an SAE criterion. 
Adverse events that do not fall into the above categories are defined as nonserious AEs. 
10.1.[ADDRESS_1027359]  
There are several AEs that will be monitored closely as AESIs to enable an adequate risk-benefit evaluation of CSL312 during the study and additional data may be requested for 
these events. The AESIs will be:  
• Bleeding events that are abnormal in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871] 
• TEEs  
o Non-systemic thrombosis (eg, localized thrombosis associated with vascular 
access) is not considered an AESI  
• Severe hypersensitivity including anaphylaxis

The severity of each AE (ie,  nonserious and serious AEs) is to be assessed by [CONTACT_301638]: 
Severity  Definition  
Mild  A type of AE that is usually transient and may require only minimal 
treatment or therapeutic intervention. The event does not generally interfere with usual activities of daily living.  
Moderate  A type of AE that is usually alleviated with additional specific therapeutic intervention. The event interferes with usual activities of daily living, 
causing discomfort but poses no significant or permanent risk of harm to the subject.  
Severe  A type of AE that interrupts usual activities of daily living, or significantly 
affects clini cal status, or may require intensive therapeutic intervention.

10.[ADDRESS_1027360] always be assessed  by [CONTACT_093]. All AEs 
will be classified as either related  or not related  to IP. If a causality assessment is not 
provided for an AE (including an SAE), that AE will be considered related to the IP. 
The degree of certainty with which an AE is attributed to the IP or an alternative cause 
(eg, natural history of the underlying disease, concomitant therapy) will be determined by 
[CONTACT_1004]: 
• Known pharmacology of the IP. 
• Clinically and/or pathophysiologically plausible context. 
• Reaction of a similar nature previously observed with similar products, or reported in the literature for similar products as being product related (eg, headache, facial flushing, pallor).  
• Plausibility supported by [CONTACT_254847] (eg, the event being related by [CONTACT_750380], drug withdrawal or 
reproduced on rechallenge).

The observation period for the reporting of AEs (and SAEs) for an individual subject will 
start at the time that informed consent is obtained for participation in the current study and 
end at the subject’s final site visit.  
If the investigator becomes aware of an SAE that has started after the EOS  Visit and is 
considered by [CONTACT_750381], the event must be reported to CSL 
following the same timelines and procedures described for SAEs occurring during the study 
(see Section  10.6.1).  
Such events are not entered into the eCRF. 
10.[ADDRESS_1027361] to follow -up. 
10.6 Adverse Event Reporting  
10.6.1  Adverse Events  
At each clinical evaluation, the investigator (or delegate) will determine whether any AEs have occurred. All AEs are to be recorded in the eCRF. If known, the medical diagnosis of an 
AE should be recorded in preference to the listing of individual signs and sym ptoms. The 
investigator must follow up on the course of an AE until resolution or stabilization. If an SAE 
is ongoing after the final study visit, the SAE will continue to be followed up until resolution, 
stabilization, or the subject is lost to follow -up. 
If, during study participation, a subject presents with a pre-existing condition that was not 
noted at the time of study entry, the condition should be retrospectively recorded in the Medical History eCRF.  
10.6.2  Serious Adverse Events  
This study will comply with all applicable regulatory requirements and adhere to the full requirements of ICH  E2A (Clinical Safety Data Management: Definitions and Standards for 
Expedited Reporting). Foreign cross reporting will be ensured.

becoming  aware of the event). An assessment of causality to the IP must be included.  
AEs occurring in the period between the time that informed consent is obtained and the time 
of the first exposure to the IP that meets [ADDRESS_1027363] be reported following the same timelines and reporting 
procedures described for SAEs occurring during the study. Such events are not entered into 
the eCRF.  
The minimum reporting requirements for reporting of SAEs include: 
• Subject identification number 
• Suspected medicinal product and/or procedure 
• Event term  
• Reporting source identification 
If the minimum requirements for reporting are fulfilled, the investigator should not wait to receive additional information to fully document the event. 
In addition, the investigator must: 
• Report all SAEs to the relevant IRB/IEC within the timeframe specified by [CONTACT_1201]/IEC.  
• If the subject is an active participant in the study: 
o Enter follow-up information in the eCRF until the SAE has resolved, or, in the 
case of permanent impairment, until stabilized.  
o Ensure that the causality assessment for all SAEs is entered in the eCRF  
• If the subject is no longer participating in the study, report the follow-up information to 
CSL.

11 Statistical Analyses  
11.1 Sample Size  
There are limited data on the rates of subjects with COVID -19 who progress to tracheal 
intubation or death prior to tracheal intubation within 28 days. For sample size calculation, a 
rate of 30% in the control group and a rate of 10% in the CSL312 group have been assumed. With a 2 -sided α = 0.05 and 1:1 randomization ratio for CSL312 + SOC ve rsus 
placebo  + SOC, a total of 124 subjects need to be randomized (62 subjects to CSL312 + SOC 
and 62 subjects to placebo  + SOC) in order to achieve 80% power to detect a treatment 
difference using a [ADDRESS_1027369]
® 6.5 software (Cytel, Inc.: Waltham, MA) 
that 80% power is maintained, accounting for the interim analysis for futilit y and sample size

agencies or CSL may access this information should the need arise. These records should be retained in a confidential manner as long as legally mandated according to local requirements.  
Subject medical records pertainin g to the study may be inspected/audited at any time by [CONTACT_254864], a health authority or the IRB/IEC. All records accessed will be strictly confidential. Consent to participate in the study includes consent to these inspections/audits  
12.5 Indemnity and Compensation  
CSL has taken out insurance to cover its obligations under both the Indemnity and the Compensation guidelines for injury to subjects involved in the study. 
Other details regarding compensation and the obligations of the investigator/CSL are 
provided in the Clinical Trial Research Agreement (CTRA) for the study ( Section  13.1).  
13 Administrative Considerations 
13.1 Clinical Trial Research Agreement  
This study will be conducted under a CTRA between CSL (“Sponsor”) and the institutions 
representing the investigational study sites (“Authority”). Financial support to the investigational sites will be detailed in the CTRA. The CTRA will clearly delineate the responsibilities and obligations of the investigators and CSL, and will form the contractual 
basis under which the clinical study will be conducted. The CTRA may be executed by 
[CONTACT_348295] (current provider DocuSign) in compliance with 21 Code of Federal 
Regulations Part 11 and simple or advanced electronic signature [CONTACT_750389]. 910/2014 – eIDAS.

Version Number: 1.0  
Effective Date: Week commencing [ADDRESS_1027386] of the 
signed CSP will be permitted without documented approval of the CSL Medical Monitor or 
designee and the IRB/IEC. In the event of a medical emergency, the investigator at the study 
site will institute any medical procedures deemed appropriate. However, all such procedures must be promptly reported to the CSL Medical Monitor and the IRB/IEC. 
Modifications to the CSP that may affect subject safety or the way the study is to be 
conducted will be documented in a protocol amendment, which must be approved by [CONTACT_5040]/IEC.  
Administrative changes to the CSP, defined as minor corrections and/or clarifications that have no effect on the way that the study is to be conducted, will not r equire IRB/IEC 
approval, but will be submitted to the IRB/IEC for their information.  
13.4 Protocol Deviations 
All instances where the requirements of the CSP were not complied with will be tracked. Corresponding subjects may be withdrawn from the study at the discretion of the investigator 
and/or CSL. CSP deviations arise when either subjects who have been entered in the study 
and/or the study sites deviate from the IRB/IEC-approved study protocol. 
If a major protocol deviation (ie, a deviation that could have a significant effect on the 
subject’s safety, rights, or welfare and/or on the integrity of the study data) occurs, the 
investigator must notify CSL and the appropriate IRB/IEC as soon as possible or as per local requirements.

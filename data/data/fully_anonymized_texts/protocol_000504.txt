Change 6: 1.1.1 PHARMACOKINETICS  
In the recently completed study in subjects with psoriasis (NI -PS101) who were administered 
a cream formulation, SB414 6%  (NVN1000 Ointment 12% co -administered with hydrogel),  
6 of 23 subjects (26.0%) had at least one quantifiable hMAP3 plasma concentration following 
dosing. The mean (SD) Cmax of hMAP3 (18.89 [15.02] ng/mL) occurred at 1 hour postdose 
in the 6 subjects with quantifiable hMAP3 plasma concentrations. The plasma concentration 
gradually decreased after the peak and hMAP3 was below the the lower limit of quantitation 
(LLOQ)  in all subjects at [ADDRESS_1016104] was  negligible in the study. The clinical study report is under preparation. Analyses 
are currently ongoing to determine systemic exposure in a study of subjects with atopic 
dermatitis (NI -AD101) administ ered  SB414 2% (NVN1000 Ointment 4% co -administered 
with  buffered hydrogel) or 6% (NVN1000 Ointment 12% co -administed with buffered 
hydrogel) .

STUDY SUMMARY  
Title: A Phase 2 Multi -Center, Randomized, Double -Blind, Vehicle -Controlled, 
Ascending Dose Study of SB206 in Subjects  with Molluscum Contagiosum  
Rationale: Molluscum Contagiosum  (MC) is benign and generally self -limiting. The 
average duration of a single lesion is about 2 months; however, since the 
lesions spread easily by [CONTACT_99093], the 
duration  of infection is often more than a year.  
There is a significant , unmet medical need to treat MC, considering most 
patients with MC are healthy young children. Ablative treatment often causes 
fear to the children and interfere in physician -patient relationships. Repeated 
ablative treatment become difficult. Topi[INVESTIGATOR_34608]206 which 
releases nitric oxide may accelerate resolution of MC without causing pain, 
and provide an effective, safe and convenient treatment option of MC.  
Target 
Population:  Males and females, 2 years  of age  and older , with a minimum of 3 and a 
maximum of 70 MC lesions at baseline . 
Number of 
Subjects:  Approximately 192 subjects with a possibility to increase up to 256 subjects . 
Objectives: This study is being conducted to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerabili ty 
of SB206 for the topi[INVESTIGATOR_743382]. Results will be used to determine  
the dose(s) for future studies .  
Study Design:  This is a phase 2 multi -center, randomized, double -blind, vehicle -controlled 
ascending dose study to be conducted in up to approximately 192 or 256 non -
immunocompromised subjects with molluscum cont agiosum . After obtaining 
informed consent, subjects who satisfy entry criteria will be randomized 3:1 
(active: vehicle) to ascending , sequential dose cohorts  of SB206 .  The highest 
tolerated dose will also be run in a cohort once daily.  Approximately 64 
subjects will be randomized to e ach cohort (see study schematic ). At 
randomization, subjects will be stratified by [CONTACT_743400] (3 -
18; 19 -70) and atopic dermatitis  (AD) history (with AD history vs w/o AD 
history).   A maximum  of [ADDRESS_1016120] clears all lesions (confirmed by [CONTACT_743401]), the treatment period will end, and subjects will 
be followed for recurrence/new lesions until Week 12/ Early Termination 
(ET) . All QD dosing should be applied in the morning at home or in the clinic.

1 INTRODUCTION AND RAT IONALE  
1.1 Background  
Molluscum contagiosum (MC) is a common skin disorder that aﬀects mainly healthy children 
(Dohil et al, 2006 ). MC has the greatest incidence in individuals aged 1–14 years (Schofield et al, 
2011 ); prevalence in children is between 5% and 11% ( Olsen et al, 2014 ).  
MC virus is an  important  human skin  pathogen  and can cause  disﬁgurement  and suffering  in 
children.  In adults MC is less common and often sexually transmitted. Extensive and persistent 
skin infection with the virus can indicate und erlying immunodeﬁ ciency. MC virus is distinct from 
other poxviruses because of its host and tissue adaptations. It infects only the skin and, rarely, the 
mucous membranes. The virus has developed ef ficient mechanisms to grow in differentiating 
cells of the human epi[INVESTIGATOR_34596] ( Chen et al, 2013 ).  
Extensive and persistent skin infection with the virus can indicate underlying immunodeficiency. 
Patients with atopic dermatitis have an impaired skin barrier in addition to immunological changes 
which could explain the rising prevalence and high number of lesions in this population. Topi[INVESTIGATOR_743383]  (both local  immunosuppressants  commonly  applied  to 
the skin in patients with atopic dermatitis) have been implicated as contributing factors in some 
patients ( Osio et al, 2011). 
MC is transmitted between human hosts by [CONTACT_34654]. 
According to a prospective community cohort study (Olsen et al, 2015), the mean time to 
resolution was 13.3 months (SD 8.2). Eighty (30%) of 269 cases had not resolved by 18 months; 
36 (13%) had not resolved by 24 months. Transmission to other children in the  household occur 
in 102 (41%) of 250 cases.  
Acidified nitrite was used in a double-blind, group-sequential clinical trial to demonstrate the 
efficacy of nitric oxide donor in treating MC ( Ormerod et al, 1999). In the study, subjects 
received either 5% sodium nitrite co-applied with 5% salicylic acid under occlusion, or identical 
cream with 5% salicylic acid, omitting sodium nitrite. Completion was defined as 3 months, 
or when the patient was cured or dropped out, if sooner. The study demonstrated that a 75% 
cure rate in the active treatment group and 21% cure with control treatment (P = 0.01). The mean 
time to cure was 1.83 months. Staining of the skin and irritation were frequent side-effects 
but did not prevent successful treatment. 
Novan, Inc. (Novan) is conducting this Phase 2 multi-center, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-
controlled,  ascending  dose study  of SB206  in subjects  2 years of age  and older  with molluscum 
contagiosum. SB206 is a topi[INVESTIGATOR_34600], formed by [CONTACT_743402]1000 Gel with hydrogel. NVN1000 
Gel contains NVN1000, a nitric oxide-releasing macromolecule containing covalently bound N-
diazeniumdiolate nitric oxide donors; nitric oxide release from the macromolecule is initiated by 
[CONTACT_743402]1000 Gel with hydrogel. 
Topi[INVESTIGATOR_743384]1000 at concentrations ranging from 1-16% have been studied in 19 
completed studies. Over 1900 healthy volunteers or subjects with acne, genital warts or tinea pedis 
16.1.1 Protocol NI -MC201, Amendment 2  
Novan: A Phase 2 Molluscum Contagiosum Ascending Dose Study Confidential  
SB206/NVN1000  Page [ADDRESS_1016133] completed and one in subjects 
with atopic  dermatitis  is ongoing.  
1.1.1  Pharmacokinetics  
The systemic bi oavailability of NVN1000 after dermal administration has been investigated in two 
maximum use studies in adults and adolescent subjects with moderate to severe acne vulgaris, and 
no detectable systemic exposure was observed. In adult subjects with moderate  to severe acne 
vulgaris (NI -AC101) administration of SB204 8% (NVN1000 Gel 16% co -administered with 
hydrogel)  or Vehicle Gel daily for [ADDRESS_1016134], back, upper shoulders twice daily 
(BID) (17% BSA) showed no detectable systemic exposure on D ay 1 or Day 5 to hMAP3, a silicon 
containing component of the parent compound .  There was no noticeable difference in systemic 
nitrate levels on Day 1 or Day 5 in subjects treated with SB204 or Vehicle Gel and no evidence of 
accumulation. Likewise, in an o pen-label PK, study (NI -AC103) in adolescents (ages 9 -16 years) 
with m oderate to severe acne v ulgaris topi[INVESTIGATOR_743385]204 4% was applied QD for 
21 days to 17% BSA and again no detectable systemic exposure to hMAP3 and no plasma nitrate 
concentr ations outside of normal variability and negli gible accumulation of nitrate after [ADDRESS_1016135], randomized, double -blind, cross -over study examining ECG effects 
following SB204 application (NI -AC104), there was no detectable  systemic exposure to hMAP3 
and no difference in plasma nitrate levels in 48 subjects with moderate to severe acne treated with 
SB204 (NVN1000) Gel 4%, SB204 (NVN1000) Gel 12% or Vehicle Gel applied to 17% BSA .  
No changes in ECG were observed with therape utic or supratherapeutic doses of SB204.  
In the recently completed study in subjects with psoriasis (NI -PS101) who were administered a 
cream formulation, SB414 6% (NVN1000 Ointment 12% co -administered with hydrogel),  6 of 
23 subjects (26.0%) had at least one quantifiable hMAP3 plasma concentration following dosing. 
The mean (SD) Cmax of hMAP3 (18.89 [15.02] ng/mL) occurred at 1 hour postdose in the 6 
subjects with quantifiable hMAP3 plasma concentrations. The plasma concentration gradually 
decreased after the peak and hMAP3 was below the the lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ)  in all 
subjects at [ADDRESS_1016136] was negligible in 
the study. The clinical study report is under preparation. Analyses are curren tly ongoing to 
determine systemic exposure in a study of subjects with atopic dermatitis (NI -AD101) 
administered SB414 2% (NVN1000 Ointment 4% co -administered with buffered hydrogel) or 6% 
(NVN1000 Ointment 12% co -administed with buffered hydrogel).   
1.1.2  Preclinical Pharmacology  
During the development of SB204 (NVN1000 Gel) for acne, SB206 (NVN1000 Gel) for the 
treatment of external genital warts and perianal warts, SB208 (NVN1000 Gel) for tinea pedis and 
SB414 (NVN1000 Ointment), Novan has conducted over [ADDRESS_1016137] Level 
16.1.1 Protocol NI -MC201, Amendment 2  
Novan: A Phase 2 Molluscum Contagiosum Ascending Dose Study Confidential  
SB206/NVN1000  Page 24 of 68 
(NOAEL)  was considered  to be  greater  than  the nominal  dose  level  evaluated  (48 mg/kg/day 
NVN1000), administered as twice daily 8% SB206 Gel or once daily 16% SB206 Gel.  There were 
no meaningful  effects  on mortality/moribundity,  clinical  observations,  physical  examination 
findings,  food consumption,  weekly  body  weight  or weekly  body  weight  change,  clinical 
pathology  parameters,  ophthalmologic  or electrocardiographic  examinations, or organ  weight 
findings.  Microscopic changes, limited to the superficial dermis and epi[INVESTIGATOR_49196], were minimal to 
mild but had not completely resolved following the 2-week recovery period. The induced changes 
included  hyperkeratosis,  epi[INVESTIGATOR_743386] 
(mononuclear cell infiltration and dermal edema). There was no evidence of systemic nitric oxide 
or hMAP3 exposure at any of the dose levels tested. This study with SB206 Gel in miniature swine 
was successful  in bridging  the safety  of topi[INVESTIGATOR_743387]1000  in the SB204 
formulation with the SB206 formulation. 
For additional info rmation refer to the Investigator’s Brochure  (IB). 
1.1.3  Potential for Drug -Drug Interactions  
Due to the low systemic exposure observed to date with SB204 clinically and with SB206 
nonclinically the risk of drug -drug interactions is low.  
1.1.4  Clinical Adverse Event P rofile  
Topi[INVESTIGATOR_743384]1000 at concentrations ranging from 1 -16% have been s tudied in  [ADDRESS_1016138] been exposed to Vehicle and 2 600 exposed to NVN1000 .  
Novan has completed a Phase 2 ascending dose study assessing the tolerability, safety, and efficacy 
of SB 206 in  subjects with external genital warts (EGW) and perianal warts (PAW). In this study, 
there were no safety concerns with single daily dose appl ication; twice daily application of SB206 
to the genitalia was associated with local application site reactions in some subjects which led to 
treatment discontinuation. The results of this study are supportive of the continued clinical 
development of SB206 . 
SB204 is in development for the treatment of acne vulgaris. The acne clinical program for SB204 
includes nine completed Phase 1 studies in healthy volunteers or subjects with acne vulgaris, three 
completed Phase 2 studies, and the completed Phase 3 progr am (two 12 -week placebo -controlled 
studies and one 40 -week open label long -term safety study in subjects ages 9 years old and older). 
Based on the clinical data acquired to date, topi[INVESTIGATOR_743388]1000 to healthy volunteers 
or subjects with acne vu lgaris has generally been well -tolerated with no safety concerns identified.  
Novan has also completed a study in subjects with tinea pedis using SB208. There were no safety 
concerns identified with once daily dosing to one or both feet; there were no appli cation site 
adverse events reported.  
In completed studies, no clinically significant changes have been observed in laboratory 
assessments, including methemoglobin, in subjects treated with topi[INVESTIGATOR_743389]1000.  The percent 
16.1.1 Protocol NI -MC201, Amendment 2  
Novan: A Phase 2 Molluscum Contagiosum Ascending Dose Study Confidential  
SB206/NVN1000  Page [ADDRESS_1016139] been no reports 
of methemoglobinemia or observed methemoglobin  levels greater than 3% in subjects treated with 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_743389]1000 in completed studies. Fluctuations in methemoglobin during treatment have 
been similar in subjects treated with topi[INVESTIGATOR_743389] [ADDRESS_1016140] doses.  
Additionally, due to the lack of systemic exposure after dermal administration of SB204 clinically 
and SB206 nonclinically observed to date, the risk to fetal development is  low. 
In prior studies using NVN1000  in different diseases, there hav e been 6 reported pregnancies , of 
those, two were completed to term with healthy babies. One woman had an elective termination 
of her pregnancy and one woman had a miscarriage. The outcom e of the other two pregnancies is 
unknown.  
1.2 Study Rationale  
MC is benign and generally self -limiting. The average duration of a single lesion is about 2 months; 
however, since the lesions spread easily by [CONTACT_99093], the mean  
duration of infection is often more than a year.  
Nitric oxide, an endogenous small molecule, provides localized immunity against foreign 
organisms by [CONTACT_587170] a short lived immune modulator and a direct broad -spectrum 
antimicrobial agent.  Topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855] e xogenous nitric oxide has been investigated as an antimicrobial 
agent due to its broad -spectrum activity, ability to inhibit viral replication, and the ability to readily 
diffuse through cell membranes.  
16.1.1 Protocol NI -MC201, Amendment 2  
Novan: A Phase 2 Molluscum Contagiosum Ascending Dose Study Confidential  
SB206/NVN1000  Page [ADDRESS_1016141] patients with MC are 
healthy young children. Ablative treatment often causes fear to the children and interfere in 
physician -patient relationships. Repeated ablative treatment become difficult. Using anesthesia 
involves safety risk and c osts. Not treating increases further dissemination of the disease. Topi[INVESTIGATOR_743390]206 which releases nitric oxide may accelerate resolution of MC without causing 
pain, and provide an effective, convenient treatment option of MC . Prevention of further 
dissemination of the disease is also important from public health perspective.  
1.2.1  Dosing Regimen  
A thin layer of SB206 4%, SB206 8%, SB206 12% or Vehicle Gel will be applied once  daily, 
twice daily, or three times a week depending on the assigned coh ort, to all affected areas of MC 
for 12 consecutive weeks  (84 days) . Subjects /caregivers  will apply the study drug to all lesions 
identified at B aseline and new lesions that arise during treatment. If a subject clears all lesions 
(confirmed by [CONTACT_743403]), the treatment period will end 
and subjects will be followed for recurrence/new lesions until Week 12/ET.  
All QD dosing should be applied in the morning at home or in the clinic .  All subjects should apply 
their l ast dose to accommodate the [ADDRESS_1016142] 2 cm from  the edge of the eye .  Lesions on the labia 
and penis will not be treated.  
Study personnel will ensure that the subjects or caregivers can identify the treatment area(s) and 
know where to apply the study drug. Subjects will be instructed on the correct use of study drug 
and the amount to apply during Baseline/Day [ADDRESS_1016143] dose of SB206 to be 
applied in this study, these doses are expected to be safe and well tolerated.

     4 STUDY PLAN  
4.1 Study Design  
This is a phase 2 multi -center, randomized, double -blind, vehicle -controlled ascending dose 
study to be conducted in up to approximately 192 or 256 non -immunocompromised subjects 
with MC. After obtaining informed consent, subjects who satisfy entry criteri a will be 
randomized 3:1 (active: vehicle) to ascending , sequential dose cohorts  of SB206 .  The highest 
tolerated dose will also be run in a cohort once daily.  Approximately 64 subjects will be 
randomized to e ach cohort (see study schematic) . At randomiza tion, subjects will be stratified 
by [CONTACT_743400] (3 -18; 19 -70) and atopic dermatitis (AD) history (with AD 
history vs w/o AD history).   A maximum of [ADDRESS_1016145] clears all 
lesions (confirmed by [CONTACT_743404] t), the treatment period 
will end, and subjects will be followed for recurrence/new lesions until Week 12/ET .  All QD 
dosing should be applied in the morning at home or in the clinic.  All subjects should apply their 
last dose to accommodate the [ADDRESS_1016146] 
dose preceding  any scheduled visit will be collected. Subjects will visit the clinic at Screening, 
Baseline, Week 1, Week 2, Week 4, Week 8, and Week 12 /ET.  
After 30 subjects randomized in a cohort ha ve completed 2 weeks of treatment, the DSMB will 
review the available unblinded safety (Methemoglobin, AE, SAE) and tolerability data.  Using 
predetermined criteria documented in the DSMB charter, the DSMB will determine if the data 
supports escalating to the next highest dose  for the next cohort or if the data shows the dose is 
not tolerable , decreasing to the next lower dose  or frequency  for the next cohort . After [ADDRESS_1016147]/caregiver withdraws 
the consent.  
The standard operating procedures of the DSMB will be documented in the DSMB charter, 
including the board’s accountability to Novan.

this study has been given a full explanation of the procedures and expectations for study 
participation.  
The site -specific informed consent forms  (ICF) /assent forms  must be forwarded to the clinical 
research organization ( CRO ) for app roval prior to submission to an Institutional Review Board 
(IRB) as appropriate. Each subject will sign the ICF that has been approved by [CONTACT_743405]. Each ICF/assent  form must adhere to the ethical principles 
stated in t he Declaration of Helsinki and will include the elements required by [CONTACT_743406] (FDA) regulations in 21 CFR as well as the International Conference on 
Harmonisation (ICH) Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines, and applicable federal and  local 
regulatory requirements. The ICF/assent  form(s) must also include a statement that Novan and the 
CRO (or their designees) and auditing regulatory agencies will have direct access to the subject’s 
records and medical history.  
Once the appropriate es sential information has been provided to the subject /caregiver  and fully 
explained by [CONTACT_737] (or a qualified designee) and it is felt that the subject /caregiver  
understands the implications and risks of participating in the study, the IRB approve d ICF/assent  
document shall be signed and dated by [CONTACT_34669] /caregiver  and the person obtaining consent 
(Investigator or designee), and by [CONTACT_99098]. The subject /caregiver  will be given a c opy of the signed ICF/assent  document with the

6.1 General Instructions  
Prospective subjects as defined by [CONTACT_99099] (Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria) will be 
considered for entry into this study. Subjects’ ICF/assent  must be obtained prior to conducting any 
procedures. Some Baseline procedures (i.e., review of inc lusion/exclusion criteria, brief physical 
exam, blood pressure and pulse rate, methemoglobin assessment, adverse event assessment, 
concomitant medication review, and UPT) must be completed prior to randomization. Subjects 
who meet all eligibility criteria who do not require washout from any current treatment may be 
screened and randomized on the same day.  
After the required procedures are completed and study eligibility is confirmed, the subject will be  
randomized to treatment utilizing an Interactive Web Response System (IWRS) which will  
identify the study drug to be dispensed to the subject. The subject/caregiver will be trained on the 
mixing,  application, and storage of the study drug. The first application should be done at the 
clinic.

Novan: A Phase 2 Molluscum Contagiosum Ascending Dose Study  Confidential  
SB206/NVN1000  Page [ADDRESS_1016166]’s treatment will be discontinued . The Investigator can 
discontinue the treatment for a subject at any time if medically necessary. If a subject’s treatment 
is discontinued by [CONTACT_743407], that AE should be indicated as the reason for 
treatment discontinuation.  In t his case, the subject is discontinued from the treatment , but still 
participates in the study and is encouraged to follow the visit schedule and complete all 
assessments.  
The Investigator may discontinue a subject’s treatment if the subject/caregiver has failed to follow 
study procedures or to keep follow -up appointments. Appropriate documentation in the subject’s 
study record and the study database regarding the reason for treatment discontinuation must be 
completed.  
Reasons for an Investigator’s withdraw al of a subject from the treatment  may include, but are 
not limited to, the following:  
• Safety (e.g., sever e adverse reactions, pregnancy)  
• When a concomitant medication or treatment likely to interfere with the results of the study 
is reported, or required,  by [CONTACT_423] (the Investigator will decide, in consultation with 
the CRO whether the subject is to be withdrawn)  
Reason(s) for discontinuation from the treatment as listed in the study record will be entered into 
the study database as follows:  
• Completed  (due to clearance of all MC or 12 weeks of treatment)  
• Adverse Event  
• Withdrawal by [CONTACT_27720]/caregiver  
• Physician Decision  
• Protocol Violation

     • Lost to Follow -Up 
• Pregnancy  
• Lack of Efficacy  
• Other  
6.3.[ADDRESS_1016167] /caregiver  may voluntarily withdraw  from study participation at any time. If the 
subject /caregiver withdraws consent and discontinues from the study, the Investigator will attempt 
to determine the reason for discontinuation and record the reason in the subject’s study records 
and in the stu dy database. In the event of discontinuation  from the study , (i.e., prior to Week 12/ET) 
every effort  should be made to have the subject return to the study center to complete the Week 
12/ET  evaluations. Subjects who withdraw from the study will not be rep laced.  
All subjects who fail to return to the study center will be contact[CONTACT_99101](s) why the subject failed to return for the necessary visit or  elected to discontinue from the 
study. If a subject /caregiver  is unreachable by  [CONTACT_34675] a minimum of  two documented 
attempts (one attempt on two different days), a certified letter will be sent  requesting that the 
subject contacts  the Investigator.  These actions will be reported on the subject’s study record and 
a copy of the  follow -up letter maintained in the Investigator's file.  
An Investigator  may withdraw a subject from the study  when a subject is lost to follow -up.   
All premature discontinuations and their causes must be carefully documented by [CONTACT_743408]’s study record and in the study database.  
All Week 12/ET evaluations should be performed at the time of premature discontinuation. All 
data gathered on the subject prior to termination will be made available to the  CRO.  
Study completion or reason(s) for discontinuation  from the study  as listed in the study record will 
be entered into  the study database as follows:  
• Completed  
• Withdrawal by [CONTACT_27720] /caregiver  
• Lost to Follow -Up 
Novan has the right to terminate or stop the study at any time. Should this be necessary, the  
Investigator will ensure that proper study discontinuation procedures are completed.

     7 DESCRIPTION OF STUDY  PROCEDURES  
Study procedures and their timings are summarized in the Schedule of Assessments  (refer to Table 
1). 
7.1 Efficacy Assessments  
7.1.1  Molluscum Contagiosum  Lesion Counts  
Molluscum contagiosum  is a viral infection characterized by [CONTACT_34677], discrete, waxy, s kin-colored , 
dome -shaped papules, an average of 3 –[ADDRESS_1016168] a central dimple 
(umbilication). In order to correctly diagnose, the evaluator should confirm the papular nature of 
molluscum by  [CONTACT_743409] a magnifier, if necessary.  Training on how to 
accurately count the number of MC lesions  will be provided .  
Definition of Clearance : “Clear” means, in the study, resolution of the active molluscum lesion 
with dome -shaped, pea rly and shiny white top centered papule, with or without umbilication.  After 
resolution, the residual surface changes such as pi[INVESTIGATOR_22940], scar, and hyper/hypo pi[INVESTIGATOR_34620].  These signs should not be counted as active lesion s. Inflammatory reaction  may also occur 
during the natural healing process.  Refer to the lesion count training for details.  
The same blinded evaluator should perform lesion counts at Screening, Baseline, and Weeks 1, 2, 
4, 8 and 12/ET. In the event that this is not possible due t o unforeseen circumstances, a different 
blinded evaluator may evaluate the subject. However, the same evaluator should evaluate subjects 
at the Baseline and Week 12/ET evaluations.  
Periocular lesions that are not treate d will not be included in the lesion  count.  Lesions on the labia 
and penis will not be treated and will not be included in the lesion count.  
7.2 Local Tolerability Assessments  (Investigator, Subject/Caregiver)  
Inflammatory reaction around the MC is considered as a predictor of imminent resolutio n of MC 
(beginning -of-the-end sign, BOTE sign) . The Investigator needs to carefully assess and if possible, 
differentiate the irritation symptom and sign (tolerability) from the BOTE sign  (Butala, 2013) . 
Subjects will be assessed at each visit from Baseline through Week 12/ET for local  tolerability.  At 
Baseline, the subject must remain at least [ADDRESS_1016169] 
for the local tolerability assessments.  The Investigato r (or designated  evaluator) will assess the 
presence and overall degree of irritation (dryness, erythema, and peeling) at the application sites 
and the score will reflect what the investigator/evaluator sees at the time of the assessment. The 
score will id eally represent an “average” across all application sites. To the fullest extent possible 
16.1.1 Protocol NI -MC201 Amendment 2   
Novan: A Phase 2 Molluscum Contagiosum Ascending Dose Study  Confidential  
SB206/NVN1000  Page 42 of 68 
 
 
    
    
     the same investigator (or designated evaluator) will perform all tolerability assessments for an 
individual subject throughout the study. Scores of 3 or 4 (Severe or Very Severe) should be 
reported as an AE.  The score will be a global assessment based on all parameters.  There will not 
be a unique score for each parameter.  
Investigator Assessment of Dryness, Erythema, and Peeling  
Score  Severity  Description  
0 No irritation  No evidence of local irritation/intolerance  
1 Mild  Minimal erythema and/or edema, slight glazed appearance  
2 Moderate  Definite erythema and/or edema with peeling and/or cracking but does not 
require treatment modification  
3 Severe (report as 
an AE)  Erythema, edema glazing with fissures, few vesicles or papules  
4 Very severe 
(report as an AE)  Strong reaction spreading beyond the treated area, bullous reaction, erosions  
At Baseline and all post baseline vis its, subjects will use a 5 -point tolerability scale to assess the 
presence and degree of burning/stinging and itching.  
At the Baseline visit , [ADDRESS_1016170] will be asked to rate the overall severity of 
their itching and burning/stinging . The assessment will apply only to the time since application of 
study drug. At Week 1 through Week 12/ET the subject will be asked to rate the overall severity 
of their itching and burning/stinging at the treatment areas since their previous visit. The score will 
ideally represent an “a verage” across all application sites. The s ubject ’s caregiver can assist in 
providing a score as needed. If the subject reports scores of 4  (Strong/Severe)  at any visit, the 
investigator should assess for accompanying signs and symptoms (erythema, edema, v esicles, 
papules, or erosions, etc.) and report as an AE accordingly. The following scores, severity and 
descriptions will be used to score subject reported tolerability.  There will be one score based on a 
full assessment of both burning/stinging and itchi ng. There will not be a unique score for each 
parameter.  
Subject Assessment of Burning/Stinging and Itching  
Score  Severity  Description  
0 None  Normal, no discomfort  
1 Slight  An awareness, but no discomfort and no intervention required  
2 Mild  A noticeable  discomfort that causes intermittent awareness  
3 Moderate  A noticeable discomfort that causes intermittent awareness and 
interferes occasionally with normal daily activities  
4 Strong/Severe  A definite continuous discomfort that interferes with normal dai ly 
activities

     7.3 Safety Assessments  
7.3.1  Physical Exam  
A brief physical examination will include heart, lung, and abdomen evaluation. This physical 
examination will be performed at Baseline and  at Week 12/ET. Height and weight will only be 
collected at Baseline. Any clinically significant changes in the physical exam from baseline will 
be recorded as AEs. 
7.3.2  Vital Signs  
Blood pressure and pulse rate will be collected at  Baseline, Week 1, Week  2, W eek 4, Week 8 
and Week 12/ET. Any clinically significant changes in vital signs from baseline will be recorded 
as AEs. 
7.3.[ADDRESS_1016171] day of treatment .  Clinically 
significan t changes in laboratory values will be recorded as AEs.  
Methemoglobin will be measured at Baseline, Weeks 1, 2, 4, 8 and Week 12/ET using a Masimo 
Rainbow® SET® Rad -57™ pulse co -oximeter. The percent methemoglobin will be displayed on 
the pulse co -oximeter  and recorded in the subject’s source documents and in the case report form 
(CRF). Subjects with methemoglobin greater than 3.0% at baseline are not eligible for the study.  
Subjects with a confirmed methemoglobin > 5.0% at any post -baseline visit will be d iscontinued 
from the study. A confirmed methemoglobin is defined as at least 2 readings within 0.5% of each 
other taken within a 30 -minute period. Methemoglobin levels will not be collected as AEs; 
however, if a subject has signs/symptoms of methemoglobine mia and an elevated methemoglobin 
level, methemoglobinemia should be reported as an AE.  
7.3.4  Pregnancy Testing  
Urine pregnancy testing for females 10 years of age and older will be collected at Screening, 
Baseline, Week 4, Week 8  and Week 12/ET. In addition to having a negative UPT at Baseline (and 
Screening unless Visit 1 is within 7 days of Screening) before the first application of study drug, 
females [ADDRESS_1016172]  be willing to use an acceptable form of birth control during 
the study. The fo llowing are considered acceptable methods of birth control for this study: 
abstinence with a documented acceptable method of birth control if the subject becomes sexually 
active, oral contraceptives, contraceptive patches, contraceptive implant, vaginal co ntraceptive, 
double -barrier methods (e.g., condom and spermicide), contraceptive injection, Intrauterine 
Device (IUD), hormonal IUD, permanent contraception, same sex partner or partner who has had 
a vasectomy .

     8 STUDY DRUG MANAGEMEN T 
8.1 Description  
8.1.1  Formulation  
Investigational Drug: SB206 4%, 8% or 12%  Comparator Drug: Vehicle Gel  
Dosing: Approximately 1.0g of SB206 QD, BID 
or TIW  Dosing: Approximately 1.0g of Vehicle Gel QD, 
BID or TIW  
8.1.2  Storage  
Upon receipt from Novan, or Novan’s designee, a study staff member will place all study supplies 
in a refrigerated temperature -controlled and monitored area. The SB206/Vehicle study product 
should be refrigerated (2 -8°C/36 -46°F) until dispensed.  
Access to study supplies should be strictly limited to the study staff. Neither the Investigator nor 
any member of the study staff will distribute any of the study supplies to any person not 
participating in this study.  
If a study staff member becomes aware that the  study supplies have not been properly handled 
(i.e., supply arrives and was not placed in refrigerator upon receipt  or there is a temperature 
excursion during shipment ), the CRO must be contact[CONTACT_15608]. In such an event, study 
supplies should be qua rantined and not be administered to any subject until Novan provides further 
direction.  
It is expected that the site staff will maintain refrigerator temperature logs in the refrigerated study 
drug storage area, recording the temperature at least once each  working day. Excursions in 
temperature during storage should be discussed with the CRO immediately and study supplies 
should be quarantined and not administered until Novan provides approval for use. Other supplies 
will be stored at room temperature.  
The study drug will be dispensed at the discretion of and by [CONTACT_99106]. It is the Investigator’s 
responsibility to ensure that accurate records of study drug dispensing and return are maintained.  
8.2 Packaging and Shipment  
Novan, or designee, will provide all study drug to the sites.  Sites are required to maintain all 
records of shipment and receipt in the Investigator Site File.

     8.3 Method of Assigning Subjects to Trea tment Groups  
In this  randomized , double -blind, vehicle -controlled  study, subjects who meet study entry criteria 
will be randomly assigned in a 3 :1 ratio (active: vehicle) to ascending , sequential dose cohorts  of 
SB206 . The randomization schedule will be computer generated using a permuted block algorithm 
and will randomly allocate IP to randomization numbers. The randomization numbers will be 
assigned sequentially through a central interactive web response system (IWRS)  as subjects are 
entered into the study  (Cohort 1, then Cohort 2, then Cohort 3) . Randomization will be stratified 
by [CONTACT_743411] (3 -18, 19 -70) and atopic dermatitis history (with AD history vs 
w/o AD history).   A maximum of [ADDRESS_1016175] (DSMB) will conduct an unblinded review of safety and tolerability data after [ADDRESS_1016176] study visits, the database for all subjects in Cohorts 1-3 will be frozen for 
purposes of an interim analysis of safety and efficacy data.  While this interim analysis is being 
prepared, the study will complete through Cohort 4 and the final analysis wi ll be based on all 
subjects in Cohorts 1 -4: Cohort 4 (QD dosing of SB206 8% or 12% vs. vehicle).   P ersonnel who 
are not otherwise involved in the study will prepare the unblinded data and summa ry tables for the 
interim analysis .  
Study personnel will endeavor to safeguard the integrity of the study blind to minimize bias in the 
conduct of the study. Individual t reatment unblinding is discouraged since knowledge of the 
treatment assignment will not materially change the planned management of a medical emergency. 
Unblinding should be discussed in advance with the medical monitor if possible. Study personnel 
will utilize the IWRS for emergency unblinding . If the investigator is not able to discuss treatment 
unblinding in advance, then he or she must notify the medical monitor as soon as possible about 
the unblinding incident without revealing the subject’s treatment assignment. The investigator or 
designee must record the date and reason for study discontinuation on the appropriate CRF for that 
subject. In all cases that are not emergencies, the investigator must discuss the event with the 
medical monitor prior to unb linding the subject’s treatment assignment.  
If treatment assignment is unblinded for an individual subject, study personnel will be notified of 
that subject’s treatment assignment without unblinding the treatment assignments for the 
remaining subjects in the study. Thus, the overall study blind will not be compromised. If a 
subject’s treatment assignment is unblinded, he or she may or may not be asked to withdraw from 
the study. The investigator will make this decision after consultation with the medical m onitor.

SB206/NVN1000  Page [ADDRESS_1016177] clears all lesions 
(confirmed by [CONTACT_743397]), the treatment period will end 
and subjects will be followed for recurrence/new lesions until Week 12/ET.   
An increase in  the number of MC lesions (with or without inflammatory reaction) during the early 
phase of the resolution is often observed. It is important to instruct the subject/caregiver to treat 
the new lesions as well as the existing lesions.  
Each dose will consist o f NVN1000 Gel or Vehicle Gel with an equal volume of hydrogel 
thoroughly mixed together by [CONTACT_743412], approximately [ADDRESS_1016178] 
number/initials, and the initials and date of the person dispensing and receiving the returned 
medication will be documented on this form.  All study product will be weighed at the time it is 
dispensed and when it is returned.   The tube weights will be recorded on the CRF . 
Inventory records must be readily available for inspection by [CONTACT_99109]/or auditor, and 
open to government inspection at any time.  
Study drug returned by [CONTACT_743398] 4 and 8 will be held on site until accountability has been 
completed. The site will be instructed on return or destructi on of used and unused clinical supplies.  
8.7 Prohibited Concomitant Therapy  
Any medication/therapy used by [CONTACT_34684] a concomitant medication (e.g., aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], acetaminophen, birth control pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], vitamins, 
etc.). Every attempt should be made to keep concomitant medication/therapy dosing constant 
during the study. Any change to concomitant medications/therapi[INVESTIGATOR_99067]’s study record and in the study database. When applicable,  an AE should be completed for 
any subject starting a concomitant medication/therapy after enrollment into the study.  
Immunosuppressive treatment  is prohibited during the study. Use of topi[INVESTIGATOR_34629] 2 cm of MC l esions is prohibited within 14 days of baseline and during 
the study. Use of the following concomitant medications to treat MC 14 days prior to baseline and 
during the study is prohibited: podophyllotoxin, imiquimod, cantharidin, sinecatechins, topi[INVESTIGATOR_26451], oral or topi[INVESTIGATOR_34611], other homeopathic or OTC products including, but not limited to,

     9 ADVERSE EVENTS  
The Investigator will assess subjects at each scheduled study visit for the occurrence of AEs.  In 
order to avoid bias in eliciting AEs, subjects /caregivers  should be asked the following non -leading 
question : “How have you felt  since your last visit? ” Adverse  events will be assessed and r eported 
after the subject is dosed, beginning from B aseline  through  the end of the subject’s last visit . SAEs 
will be collected from the time of consent  through the end of the subject’s last visit . 
9.1 Documenting Adverse Events  
All AEs (serious and non -serious) reported by [CONTACT_743413] r ecorded on the subject’s study 
record and entered into the study database.  The date of onset, date ended, seriousness, severity, 
outcome, relationship to study drug, therapy required, and action taken regarding study drug and 
study participation will be r eported for each AE.  
9.2 Assessment of Severi ty 
The Investigator is responsible for evaluating all AEs and determining the severity of the event.  
Severity will be categorized according to the following definitions:  
• Mild:  Event may be noticeable to subject; d oes not influence daily activities; usually 
does not require intervention  
• Moderate:  Event may be of sufficient severity to make subject uncomfortable; 
performance of daily activities may be influen ced; intervention may be needed  
• Severe:  Event may cause s evere discomfort; usually interferes with daily activities; 
subject may not be able to continue in the study; treatment or other intervention usually 
needed  
The Investigator will follow all subjects who experience AEs as described in Section 9.5. 
9.3 Assessment of Causality  
Relationship of an AE to study drug  will be assessed as follows:  
• Definite:  There is a clinically plausible time sequence between the onset of the AE and the 
application of study drug ; when the event responds to withdrawal of Study drug  and recurs 
with re -administration of study drug . 
• Probable:  There is a clinically pl ausible time sequence between the onset of the AE and 
the application of study drug ; the AE is unlikely to be caused by [CONTACT_95330]/underlying 
illness, other drugs or procedures.  
• Possible:  There may or may not be a clinically plausible time sequence be tween the onset 
of the AE and the application of study drug  and a cause cannot be ruled out.

     • Unlikely:  There is no reasonable temporal association between the test material and the 
suspected event and the event could have been produced by [CONTACT_423]'s cl inical state or 
other modes of therapy administered to the s ubject.  
• Unrelated:  This term should be reserved for those events that cannot be even remotely 
related to study participation.  
9.[ADDRESS_1016180] scheduled study visit (Week 12/ET) 
must be recorded in the s tudy database as ongoing/not recovered/not resolved.  
9.5.[ADDRESS_1016181] (Week 12 /ET) must be 
recorded in the study database and reported to the CRO  accordi ng to the reporting procedures 
outlined in Section  10.2. This may include unresolved previously reported SAEs, or new SAEs. 
The Investigator  should follow these SAEs until the events are resolved, or the subject is lost to 
follow -up. The Investigator should continue to report any significant follow -up information to the 
CRO and the IRB up to the point the event has been resolved. Resolution means the subject has 
returned to the baseline  state of health, or the Investigator  does not expect any further improvement 
or worsen ing of the subject’s condition.  
9.[ADDRESS_1016182] use an effective method of birth control during the course 
of the study and for 30 days following their final study visit. The following are considered 
acceptable methods of birth control for this study: abstinence with a document ed acceptable 
method of birth control if the subject becomes sexually active oral contraceptives, contraceptive 
patches, contraceptive implant, vaginal contraceptive, double -barrier methods (e.g., condom and 
spermicide), contraceptive injection, IUD, hormo nal IUD, permanent contraception, same sex 
partner or partner who has had a vasectomy . 
Before enrolling any subject in this clinical trial, the Investigator must review guidelines about 
study participation with the subject/caregiver, including the topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102] b elow:  
• Informed consent document  
• Pregnancy prevention information  
16.1.1 Protocol NI -MC201 Amendment 2   
Novan: A Phase 2 Molluscum Contagiosum Ascending Dose Study  Confidential  
SB206/NVN1000  Page 52 of 68 
 
 
    
    
     • Risks to unborn child(ren)  
• Any drug interactions with hormonal contraceptives  
• Contraceptives in current use  
• Guidelines for the follow -up of a reported pregnancy  
Prior to study enrollment, all  subjects must be advised of the importance of avoiding pregnancy 
during participation in this clinical study and the potential risk factors for an unintentional 
pregnancy. The subject must sign an informed consent document stating that the above -mentioned  
risk factors and the consequences were discussed.  
Cases of pregnancy that occur during maternal exposure to study drug should be reported. During 
the study, subjects  should be instructed to contact [CONTACT_743414] b e pregnant (e.g., missed or late menstrual cycle). The Investigator must immediately notify 
the CRO  of any female subject who becomes pregnant any time during study participation, record 
the information on the pregnancy notification form and email the form  to the CRO.  Subjects found 
to be pregnant prior to Week 12/ET  will be discontinued from the study. The CRO  will ask the 
site to follow -up with the subject periodically during the pregnancy for ongoing health and safety 
information through the end of the p regnancy  as applicable. Protocol -required procedures for the 
Week 12/ET evaluation must be performed for the subject.  
9.[ADDRESS_1016183] supportive care should 
be utilized.  Methylene blue m ay be used to treat subjec ts exhibiting methemoglobinemia .

     10 SERIOUS ADVERSE EVEN T 
10.1 Definition of Serious Adverse Event  
A SAE is any event that meets any of the following criteria:  
• Death  
 
• Life-threatening  event  (i.e., the subject was at immediate risk of death from the event as it 
occurred. It  does not include a reaction that if it had occurred in a more serious form might 
have caused death. For example, drug induced hepatitis that resolved without evidence of 
hepatic failure would not be considered life threatening even though drug induced hepatitis 
can be fatal. ) 
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  (AEs requiring 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_166504]. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_99069] (e.g., elective surgery for a pre -existing 
condition that has not worsened) need not be considered AEs or SAEs. If anything, 
untoward is reported during the procedure, that occurrence mus t be reported as an AE, 
either 'serious' or 'non -serious' according to the usual criteria. In  general, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_99070] (usually involving at least an overnight stay) at 
the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_743393]/or treatment that would not have been 
appropriate in the physician's office or outpatient setting. When in doubt as to whether 
'hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]' occurred or was necessary, the AE should be considered serious.)  
• Persistent or significant disability/ incapacity  (if the experience results in a substantial 
and/or permanent disruption of the subject's ability to carry out normal life functions)  
• Congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of a subject who received SB206 or 
Vehicle Gel  
• Other: Important  medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], may be considered an SAE when, based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention 
to preve nt one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such events are:  
− Intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home  for allergic bronchospasm  
− Blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
− Development of drug  dependency or drug abuse

Novan: A Phase 2 Molluscum Contagiosum Ascending Dose Study  Confidential  
SB206/NVN1000  Page [ADDRESS_1016184] be reported to the CRO as soon as possible 
after the Investigator  or coordinator has become aware of its occurrence. The 
Investigator /coordinator  must notify the CRO  within [ADDRESS_1016185]:  
1. Report the SAE or pregnancy immediately  (within 24  hours) after the Investigator  becomes 
aware of the event.  
2. Complete an SAE or pregnancy notification form and send to the safety office  within [ADDRESS_1016186]’s treatment and follow -up and document as 
appropriate.  
4. Provide a more detailed report to both the CRO  and the IRB, if applicable, no later than 
seven days after the Investigator  discovers the event as further information becomes 
available, and when necessary update the information with follow -up information 
including outcomes. This report should include a statement as to whether the event was or 
was not related to the use of study dr ug. 
5. The Investigator  will notify the IRB of the SAE or pregnancy according to specific IRB 
requirements.  
6. The Investigator will collect information on SAEs until the subject’s health has returned to 
baseline  status, until all parameters have returned to nor mal, or remaining health issues 
have otherwise been explained.

     11 STATISTICS  
11.1 General Procedures  
Prior to the release of unblinded information through Cohort 3, a detailed, finalized Statistical 
Analysis Plan (SAP) will be completed and placed on file.  The St atistical Analysis Plan will 
contain a more comprehensive explanation than that provided here of the methodology used in the 
statistical analyses, as well as the rules and data handling conventions used to perform the analyses 
and the procedure used to acc ount for missing data.  
Safety and efficacy endpoints will be displayed using descriptive statistics and graphical displays. 
For categorical variables, frequencies, and percentages will be presented. The denominator for  
percentage will be based on the numbe r of subjects appropriate for the purpose of analysis.  
Continuous variables will be summarized using descriptive statistics (number of subjects,  mean, 
median, standard deviation [SD], minimum, and maximum). Where relevant, 95% confidence 
intervals will be calculated. Although analyses will be descriptive in nature, any statistical tests will 
be conducted at the 0.[ADDRESS_1016187]  cohort is 
administered 12% BID ,  up to an additional 64 subjects will be randomized in a fourth cohort.  
This Phase 2 study wa s not powered for formal statistical comparisons. The SB206 active dose 
groups will be compared to Vehicle gel. No adjustments will be made for multiplicity. No 
imputations will be utilized for safety or efficacy endpoints  
11.3 Analysis Populations  
The analysis  populations include the following:  
The intent -to-treat (ITT) population will consist of all subjects who are randomized.  
The modified intent -to-treat (mITT) population will consist of all subjec ts who are randomized 
and complete the study treatment  (subje cts who complete 12 weeks of treatment and subjects who 
complete treatment due to clearance of all molluscum) . 
The safety  (SAF)  population will consi st of all patients who take at least one dose of study 
treatment . 
The exposure population will consist of a ll subjects who receive at least 1 application of active 
study medication and had a blood a blood sample collected and successfully analyzed for the 
hMAP3 plasma concentration.  
16.1.1 Protocol NI -MC201 Amendment 2   
Novan: A Phase 2 Molluscum Contagiosum Ascending Dose Study  Confidential  
SB206/NVN1000  Page 56 of 68 
 
 
    
    
     The per -protocol population (PP) will consist of all subjects in the mITT population and have no 
significant protocol deviations  that impact the analyses of the efficacy endpoints .  
11.[ADDRESS_1016188].  
11.4.2  Effica cy Analysis  
The primary efficacy endpoint is the proportion  of subjects achieving comple te clearance of all 
molluscum contagiosum at Week 12 (subjects who achieved complete clearance before Week 12 
need to maintain complete clearance at Week 12 ) which  will be analyzed by a logistic regression 
model with treatment, number of lesions at Baselin e (3-18; 19 -70) and atopic dermatitis history 
(with AD history vs w/o AD history)  as factors . The primary analysis will compare each SB206 
dose level with the Vehicle using  the mITT population.  
A sensitivity analysis of the primary endpoint will be repeate d using the  ITT and  per-protocol 
population. Other sensitivity analyses may be performed and will be specified in the statistical 
analysis plan.  
Secondary endpoints will be analyzed on the mITT  and ITT  population as follows:  
• Proportion of subjects achievin g complete clearance of all MC at each visit  will be 
analyzed using the same logistic regression analysis specified in the primary analysis.  
• Time to complete clearance of all MC  will be analyzed using Kaplan Meier methods.  
• Proportion of subjects achieving at least a 75% reduction from baseline in the number of 
MC at each visit  will be analyzed using the same logistic regression analysis specified in 
the primary analysis.  
• Mean change and percent change from baseline in number of MC at each visit  will be 
analyzed using a mixed -model repeated -measures (MMRM) analysis with treatment as the 
main effect, visit, number of lesions at Baseline (3-18; 19 -70) and atopic dermatitis  history 
(with AD history vs w/o AD history)  as factors an d treatment b y visit as an interaction 
term.  
Details of all secondary and exploratory endpoints will be specified in the SAP. Additional 
exploratory analyses may be conducted, all analyses will be detailed in the SAP, which will be 
finalized before databas e lock.

     11.4.3  Analysis of Safety  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Adverse Events  
All AEs that occur during the study will be recorded and classified on the basis of Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) terminology. Treatment -emergent AEs (TEAEs) 
are defined as AEs with an onset  on or after the date of the first study drug dose. Medical history 
noted prior to the first study drug administration that worsen after Baseline will also be reported 
as AEs and included in the summaries.  
Treatment -emergent AEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_12922], the number of subjects 
reporting a TEAE, System Organ Class (SOC ), preferred term, severity, relationship to study 
drug (causality), and seriousness.  When summarizing AEs by [CONTACT_42564], each 
subject will be counted only once wi thin a system organ class or a preferred term by [CONTACT_743415].  
Serious AEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570], severity, and relationship to study drug, 
and individual SAEs will be listed by [CONTACT_1130]. In addition, a list of subjects who prematurely 
discontinue from the study due to an AE will be provided.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Physical Examination  
Changes in physical examination from baseline to end of treatment will be summarized.  Any 
clinic ally significant changes from Baseline will be documented as an AE.  
[IP_ADDRESS]   Vital Signs  
Blood pressure and pulse will be summarized by [CONTACT_321968] 
12/ET.  Additionally, change from Baseline in vital signs will be summarized at Week s 1, 2, 4, 8, 
and 12 /ET.  Any clinically significant changes from Baseline will be documented as an AE.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Laboratory Assessments  
Blood chemistry  and hematology values will be reported individually at Baseline and day of last 
dose, which may occur at any time during the study.  Therefore, the study day of the last dose will 
be used to assign the laboratory values to the closest study visit (Week 1, 2, 4, 8, or 12).  Laboratory 
test results will be summarized descriptively at Baseli ne and each visit .  Additionally, shifts from 
Baseline to each visit  in laboratory test results based on normal ranges will be summarized with 
descriptive statistics.  The last laboratory evaluation prior to the first dose of study drug will be 
used as Bas eline for all laboratory analyses.   Any clinically significant changes from Baseline will 
be documented as an AE.  
Methemoglobin will be reported as a percentage of hemoglobin.  Methemoglobin will be 
summarized descriptively by [CONTACT_743416] a nd Weeks 1, 2, 4, 8  and 12 /ET.  
Additionally, the change from baseline in methemoglobin will be summarized by [CONTACT_743417] .

     [IP_ADDRESS]  Urine Pregnancy Tests  
Urine pregnancy tests results for females [ADDRESS_1016189] study visits, the database for all subjects 
in Cohorts 1 -3 will be frozen for p urposes of an interim analysis of safety and efficacy data.  
While this interim analysis is being prepared, the study will complete through Cohort 4 and the 
final analysis will be based on all subjects in Cohorts 1 -4: Cohort 4 (QD dosing of SB206 8% or 
12% vs. vehicle).   Personnel who are not otherwise involved in the study will prepare the 
unblinded data and summary tables for the interim analysis.  The interim analysis will not impact 
the final analysis since the study does not involve any formal hypothe sis testing.

Investigator must submit all essential regulatory documentation, as required by [CONTACT_99114] (including approval of the protocol and informed consent/assent form by [CONTACT_2717]) to 
the CRO before investigational product will be shipped to th e study site.  The Investigator will 
review the final study results to confirm that to the best of his knowledge, it accurately describes 
the con duct and results of the study.  
12.[ADDRESS_1016191] (DSMB) will review the available unblinded safety and tolerability data.  Using 
predetermined criteria documented in the DSMB charter, the DSMB will determine if the data 
supports escalating to th e next highest dose  for the next cohort or if the data shows the dose is not 
tolerable, decreasing to the next lower dose or frequency for the next cohort . All responsibilities 
of the DSMB and details of data to be reviewed will be detailed in the DSMB cha rter. 
12.[ADDRESS_1016192]/Independent Ethics Committee  
The protocol, informed consent / assent  form(s), recruitment materials, and all participant materials 
will be submitted to the Institutional Review Board (IRB) for review and approval.  Approval of 
both the protocol and the consent /assent  form must be obtained before any subject  is screened .  
Any amendment to the protocol will require review and approval by [CONTACT_99115].  In addition, all changes to the consent /assent  form will be IRB -
approved; a determination will be made regarding whether a new consen t needs to be obtained 
from subjects  who provided consent, using a previously appr oved consent form.  
12.[ADDRESS_1016193]’s study participation. Consent /assent  forms will be 
Institutional Review Board (IRB) -approved and the subject  will be asked to read and review the 
document. The investigator will explain the research study to the subject  and answer any questions 
that may arise. A verbal explanation will be provided in terms suited to the subject ’s 
comprehension of the purposes, procedures, and potential risks of the study and of their rights as 
research subjects .  Subject s will have the opportunity to carefully review the written consent /assent  
form and ask questions prior to signing. The subjects  should have the opportunity to discuss the 
study with their family or surrogates or think about it prior to agreeing to participate. The informed 
consent /assent  document  shoul d be signed  prior to any procedures being done specifically for the 
study. Subjects  must be informed that participation is voluntary and that they may withdraw from 
the study at any time, without prejudice. A copy of the informed consent /assent  document wi ll be 
given to the subjec ts for their records. The informed consent process will be conducted and

undergoes any study -specific procedures. The rights and welfar e of the subject s will be protected 
by [CONTACT_743418] e to participate in this study.  
12.5 Records Management  
It is the responsibility of the Investigator to ensure that th e study center file is maintained in 
accordance with Section 8 – Essential Documents for the Conduct of a Clinical Trial of the ICH 
Guidance for Industry E6 Good Clinical Practice: Consolidated Guidance and [ADDRESS_1016194]:  
• Country -specific requirements; or  
• A period of at least two years following the last approval of a marketing application 
approved by a Regulatory Authority in an ICH region or until there are no pending or 
contemplated marketing applications in an ICH regio n; or,  
• A period of two years after Novan notifies the Investigator that the data will not be 
submitted for review by [CONTACT_34699].  
The Investigator must not dispose of any records or essential documents relevant to this study 
without either (1)  written permission from Novan, or (2) providing an opportunity for Novan to 
collect such records.  The Investigator shall take responsibility for maintaining adequate and 
accurate electronic or hard copy source documents of all observations and data gener ated during 
this study.  Such documentation is subject to inspection by [CONTACT_34700].  
If the Investigator withdraws from the study (e.g., relocation, retirement), all study -related records 
should be transferred to a mutually agre ed-upon designee.  Notice of such transfer will be provided 
to Novan in writing  
16.1.1 Protocol NI -MC201 Amendment 2

SB206/NVN1000  Page [ADDRESS_1016195] operating procedures ( SOPs ) may be performed to evaluate compliance with the 
principles of GCP.  A regulatory authority may also wish to conduct an inspection (during the 
study or even after its completion).  If a regulatory authority requests an inspection, the Investigator 
must inform the CRO  immediately that this request has been made.  
Study conduct may be assessed during the course of the study by a Quality Assurance 
representative(s) to ensure that the study is conducted in compliance with the protocol and GCP.  
He/she will  be permitted to inspect the study documents (study protocol, study records, 
investigational product, original, study -relevant medical records).  All subject data will be treated 
confidentially.  
13.2 Monitoring  
All aspects of the study will be monitored by [CONTACT_743419] (GCP) and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for compliance with applicable 
government regulations, (i.e., informed consent regulations, (21 C.F.R. § 50.20, 1999), and 
Institutional Review Board regulatio ns, (21 C.F.R. § 56.103, 1981)).  Access to all records, both 
during the trial and after trial completion, should be made available to the CRO  and Novan at any 
time for review and audit to ensure the integrity of the data.  The Investigator must notify the CRO  
immediately if the responsible IRB has been disqualified or if proceedings leading t o 
disqualification have begun.  
The Investigator must conduct the protocol in accordance with applicable GCP regulations and 
guidelines, applicable informed consent reg ulations (21 C.F.R. § 50.20, 1999), and in compliance 
with the principles in the Declaration of Helsinki.  Every attempt must be made to follow the 
protocol and to obtain and record all data requested for each subject at the specified times.  If data 
is no t recorded per protocol, the reason(s) must be clearly documented on the study records.  
Before study initiation, at a site initiation visit or at a meeting with the Investigator(s), a CRO  or 
Novan representative will review the protocol and study records w ith the Investigator(s) and their 
staff.  During the study, the study monitor will visit the site regularly to check the completeness of 
subject records, the accuracy of entries into the study database, the adherence to the protocol and 
to GCP, the progres s of enrollment, to ensure that consent is being sought and obtained in 
compliance with applicable regulations, and that the investigational product is being stored, 
dispensed and accounted for according to specifications.  The Investigator and key trial p ersonnel 
must be available to assist the monitor during these visits.  
The Investigator must give the monitor access to relevant hospi[INVESTIGATOR_176256].  No information in these records abou t the 
identity of the subjects will leave the study center.  Monitoring standards require full verification 
for the presence of informed consent, adherence to the inclusion/exclusion criteria, documentation

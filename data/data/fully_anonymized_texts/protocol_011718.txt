OBJECTIVES: 
The primary purpose of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_674451] a novel head worn light device (Re-Timer®) as 
an intervention to improve glucose metabolism in people with prediabetes. The hypothesis is 
that morning light treatment will improve glucos e metabolism. This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_674452] a larger clinical trial. 
 
 
BACKGROUND: Circadian Misalignment Impacts Risk for Type 2 Diabetes 
The central circadian clock, which regulates many circadian rhythms, is located in the 
suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN, 
1). In humans, central circadian timing is most reliably estimated 
from the onset of melatonin secretion in dim light (DLMO 2,3), which occurs ~2-[ADDRESS_911400] humans (>70%), the endogenous period of the central circadian clock is greater than 
24 h 7,8, resulting in an endogenous tendency to drift later each day (phase delay). Such drift 
can result in a mismatch between behavioral cycles (sleep-wake and meal times) and internal biological time, known as “circadian misalignment”. There is evidence indicating that circadian misalignment is associated with increased diabetes risk and worse diabetic outcomes. Later sleep timing or self-reported eveningness (suggestive of circadian misalignment) is positively associated with obesity 
9-12, and T2DM (OR 1.73-2.5, 13,14), and predictive of future increases in 
BMI 15, even after adjusting for potentially confou nding variables such as age, sex, race, SES, 
physical activity and sleep duration. Later sleep timi ng is also associated with reduced glycemic 
control (higher HbA1c) in patients with T2DM 16, even after adjusting for age, sex, race, BMI, 
insulin use, depression, sleep debt and diabetes complications.   Laboratory studies have also investigated the effects of circadian misalignment on diabetes 
risk in healthy humans. In one study, circadian mi salignment resulted in an overall 6% increase 
in 28 h levels of glucose, despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] a 22% increase in insulin, and 3 out of 8 subjects exhibited 2-h 
postprandial glucose responses >140- <210 mg/dl (prediabetic or diabetic levels) 17. In a second 
study, circadian misalignment resulted in an 8% increase in glucose but 12% decrease in insulin (fasting), and a 14% increase in glucose but 27% decrease in insulin (postprandial) 
18. However, 
in these studies circadian misalignment also disrupted sleep, and disrupted sleep can impair glucose metabolism 
19. A third study examined less severe circadian misalignment (2 x 2 
daytime sleep epi[INVESTIGATOR_674453]-time sleep) and controlled for sleep by 
[CONTACT_240903]#: 00204710 
Version #: 10  Version Date:  05/03/2018 Page 2 of 19 
HRP-593 / v011017 comparing to a control condition with equivalent sleep loss 20. They found that circadian 
misalignment, independent of sleep loss, resulted in an additional 26% reduction in insulin 
sensitivity in men, with no compensatory increases  in insulin release, reflecting a significant 
increased risk of T2DM. The authors concluded “this provides evidence in support of an intrinsic adverse effect of circadian misalignment on glucose metabolism.” (p1868, 
20). 
 The precise mechanism(s) by [CONTACT_674464], but may include: (1) direct impact of SCN activity on glucose regulation via  multisynaptic projections from the SCN to the liver and pancreas 
21-23, (2) 
suppressed melatonin levels (light exposure during night), which is independently associated 
with increased insulin resistance in nondiabetics 24 and the development of T2DM 25. Indeed, 
the melatonin receptors on pancreatic beta-cells 26 preserve beta-cell function by [CONTACT_166187] 
“functional overcharge” 27,28, (3) circadian misalignment results in peripheral molecular 
dysfunction 29, which downstream in the pancreas and liv er can adversely impact diabetes risk 
30-32. Thus, “dysregulation of circadian secretion may be a key to the increase of T2DM” (p829, 
33). 
 
The Effect of Morning Light Treatment on Glucose Metabolism Remains to be 
Investigated 
Light is the strongest environmental signal that can alter circadian timing. Light is captured by [CONTACT_941] 5 retinal photoreceptors (rods, 3 cones, and the intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion 
cells [ipRGCs] 
34,35). The ipRGCs are the primary circadian photoreceptor as they transmit the 
light signal directly to the SCN 34,36. The ipRGCs are most sensitive to short (~480 nm) 
wavelengths of light. Evening light shifts circadian timing later (phase delays) and can exacerbate the endogenous tendency towards circadian misalignment 
37,38. By [CONTACT_674465], there is potential to phase advance circadian timing 39,40. Conversely, 
morning light shifts the clock earlier (phase advance), and helps to realign circadian timing to more closely match the external environment, and reduce circadian misalignment 
37,38. Thus, 
morning light is the most important light most humans receive every day.   Given the associations between later sleep/circadian timing and risk for T2DM, one would expect morning light to be associated with a reduction in risk for T2DM. Four studies have 
examined these relationships. The first reported that the addition of daily morning light (1 h, 5,000 lux) to a 6 week exercise program in 17 overweight/obese people led to a significant reduction in body fat that did not occur with exercise alone 
41. A second study reported that daily 
morning light (45 mins, 1300 lux) for [ADDRESS_911401] study reported that a single dose of morning light (2 h, 60 lux) changed 
appetite regulating hormones (leptin, ghrelin) in a direction that would reduce hunger in [ADDRESS_911402] year, a study of healthy individuals reported that brighter light 
exposure (>500 lux) earlier in the day independently predicted a lower BMI, even after adjusting for age, sex, season, activity and sleep duration 
44. All these studies point to the high potential 
for morning light treatment to reduce risk for T2DM, and highlight that many of the effects of 
morning light were observed in small sample sizes. Indeed, as others have recently stated: (1) 
“prescribed light exposure needs to be tested for its ability to restore the physiological dialogue between circadian mechanisms and metabolic pathways” (p7, 
45) and (2) “interventional studies 
assessing the role of manipulating the master clock in the treatment of T2D are needed…the master clock can be manipulated by [CONTACT_674466]” (p326, 
46). 
 Preliminary Data Later Circadian Timing is Associated with Increased Risk for Type [ADDRESS_911403] to examine the cross-
sectional association between sleep/circadian timing and diabetes risk in persons without

HRP-593 / v011017 diabetes. We examined the associations bet ween the timing of sleep based on 1-week of 
actigraphy (average midpoint of sleep) and circadian timing  
(gold standard circadian phase marker in humans, DLMO), and fasting glucose levels in the first 
20 subjects with data (Figure 1). Results indicate that later sleep/circadian timing is significantly 
associated with higher fasting glucose even in those who do not currently have 
diabetes. These 
data are entirely consistent with the literature and represent the first 
data examining the 
relationship between the DLMO and fasting glucose.  
  
Creating a Placebo Light Treatment  
We now plan to test an active Re-timer® versus a placebo Re-timer®. We first considered 
creating a placebo Retimer® by [CONTACT_674467]-timer® with red LEDs (~660 nm), as this wavelength is further from the maximum sensitivity of the ipRGCs 
34,36. However, this would 
have required additional ocular and electrical safety testing. Furthermore, subjects would have quickly discovered the red Re-timers® were not standard treatment, as we find many subjects look up their light devices on the internet. Thus, it appeared likely that subject expectations 
would have differed significantly between the standard versus red Re-timer®. Therefore, we 
enlisted the help of [CONTACT_674498] from Rush University (consultant on this grant), who used neutral density filters to markedly reduce the light intensity of the Re-timers® to a level that 
will not shift circadian timing. There are no 
safety concerns because the light from the already safety approved Re-timer® has simply been dimmed. [CONTACT_131842]’s spectroradiometer recordings confirm that irradiance in these dimmed Re-timers® is reduced from 230 
μW/m
2 to 3 μW/m2, and lux reduced from 500 
lux to 7 lux (Figure 2). Importantly, the placebo 
(dimmed) Re-timers® appear identical to those featured on the Re-timer® website and so are a highly believable placebo that should lead to 
similar expectations between treatment groups. 
 
Measures of Compliance to Light Treatment  
[CONTACT_409720] (Rush University PI) developed a measure of compliance to the Re-timer®, as none 
exists. By [CONTACT_674468]-timer® (does not unbalance 
frame), she can examine (1) green light to determine active Re-timer® on/off times and (2) 
activity to confirm both placebo and active Re-timers® are worn at the assigned times.

HRP-593 / v011017 The goal of this research project is to test a novel behavioral intervention, morning light 
treatment, to see if it can improve glucose metabolism in people with prediabetes.  
 
Primary Outcomes: 
Outcome 1: We will determine the effect of active versus placebo morning light treatment on 
glucose metabolism in individuals with prediabetes. 
 
Outcome 2:  We will determine the extent to which circadian phase advances in the DLMO are 
related to improvements in glucose metabolism in individuals with prediabetes.  
 
PROCEDURES INVOLVED: 
Figure 3 presents an overview of the 5 week protocol. After screening for eligibility (see below) 
and informed consent, subjects will wear a wris t actigraph throughout the study. Subjects will 
complete a daily sleep and medication log, a questionnaire packet, and a 3-day food diary at the end of the baseline week and week 4. After the baseline week, there will be an overnight stay at the Northwestern University Clinical Resear ch Center. Questionnaires and food diaries will be 
reviewed and body fat via bioimpedance will be measured. The DLMO will be assessed. Subjects will be given dinner [ADDRESS_911407] (OGTT) will be performed in the Clinical Research Unit (CRU) 2 h after wake. Subjects will then begin a 4 week morning light treatment (see details below). The first 10 subjects will be assigned active (bright), and the following 5 will be assigned placebo (dim) Re-timer®. If more subjects are enrolled in the study, the next 10 will be placed on active (bright) treatment. Subjects will receive feedback on their compliance at weekly visits. Subjects will be 
paid $[ADDRESS_911408] step in testing morning light treatment to improve glucose 
metabolism, we will enroll a sample of 34 subjects (50% female, ages 35-75 years), who are 
most likely to benefit from morning light. These subjects will: (1) be obese (BMI ≥25 kg/m
2), (2) 
have prediabetes (HbA1c 5.7% to <6.5%),  and (4) be free of severe obstructive sleep apnea (apnea-hypopnea index<30). Subjects will be screened initially over the phone or by [CONTACT_674469], and be asked to begin recording their bed times and 
wake times to determine the schedule for their light treatment. If potentially eligible, they will be 
invited to a pre-study screening visit, during which height and weight and HbA1c (finger stick of blood) will be assessed. Subjects will also need to pass a urine drug screen. [CONTACT_674499], a board-certified endocrinologist (co-investigator), will refer any subjects who are identified as having diabetes, for treatment. Any subjects identified as having prediabetes will also be Baseline

HRP-593 / v011017 referred to treatment, but also invited to participate in the final home screen for obstructive sleep 
apnea. Note that subjects who begin prediabetes treatment prior to the end of the study will be dropped, however, due to common delays in seeing a physician (over a month), this is unlikely 
to affect many subjects (as part of intent-to-treat analysis the last observation will be carried 
over). Subjects will be instructed in the use of the WatchPAT™ device (Itamar Medical Ltd.) to 
screen for obstructive sleep apnea. WatchPAT utilizes Peripheral Arterial Tone (PAT), a 
physiological signal that mirrors changes in the autonomic nervous system caused by 
[CONTACT_15206][INVESTIGATOR_674454]. The automatic algorithm of WatchPAT analyzes the PAT 
signal amplitude along with heart rate and oxygen saturation to identify respi[INVESTIGATOR_674455]. [CONTACT_77108], who is board certified in sleep medicine and a consultant on this grant, will oversee the interpretation of the home sleep screen. Any subject with an apnea-hypopnea index ≥15 will be informed of the result by [CONTACT_674470] a nearby 
[CONTACT_674471].   Laboratory sessions will occur during women’s follicular phase or women will be 
postmenopausal (≥ [ADDRESS_911410] menses). Wom en on oral contraceptives or hormone 
replacement therapy will be excluded (alters OGTT 
48,49 and melatonin 4). Additional exclusion 
criteria include: history of any form of diabetes, smokers, shift workers, eye disease, 
photosensitizing medications, regular hypnotic use ( ≥ 3 nights/week) daily beta-blocker, NSAID 
or melatonin use (confounds DLMO), history of psychiatric disorders (confounds light 
treatment), pregnancy/breastfeeding, irregular menses, history of cardiovascular disease 
(excluding hypertension), endocrine, kidney, GI or liver disorder, seizures, cancer. Recruitment will include advertising the study to current diabetes patients to recruit family members who may 
meet eligibility criteria. [CONTACT_674499] sees over  350 diabetes patients each year. Recruitment will 
also include posting fliers, brochures, news paper advertisements, and advertisements around 
Chicago, online, at various clinics in the Chicago area (as permitted by [CONTACT_674472]) and attending community events. Note that recruitment at various clinics 
will involve only distributing flyers and brochures, but will not include sharing of patient information directly with us. Thus, the initial contact [CONTACT_674473].   
Light Treatment . The [ADDRESS_911411]’s average wake time, as determined from  the baseline week of actigraphy. The light 
treatment may start up to [ADDRESS_911412]’s usual morning schedule 
(work, child care) if required 
53,54. Subjects are provided with an alarm set to the start of the 
morning treatment. A light log to note light on/off times and any interruptions to the light treatment will be provided. Subjects will be instructed to maintain their baseline sleep duration throughout the light treatment. Daily bed and wake time phone calls to a time-stamped voice mail will be reviewed daily with phone calls to subjects if required to ensure compliance. Wrist 
actigraphy data will be reviewed weekly in the presence of the subject. Importantly, the Re-
timer® light device is commercially available. The adjustable nose pad on each Re-timer® 
(whether active or placebo) will be individually fit to each subject to optimize the light treatment (Appendix). After the introduction to the Re-timer® (whether active or placebo), subjects will complete a treatment expectation item of 0 “expect no change” to 10 “expect to be healthier”. In 
between weekly visits, subjects will be encouraged to call research staff 24/7 with any questions 
about the light treatment. At the start of the second laboratory session, subjects will complete a treatment satisfaction item of 0 “not at all satisfied” to 10 “extremely satisfied”.   
 
Measures Oral Glucose Tolerance Test. During each laboratory session, a 3-h [ADDRESS_911413], a bl ood sample for fasting glucose and insulin will 
be obtained at -15 mins and 0 mins immediately followed by [CONTACT_674474] 75g of

HRP-593 / v011017 dextrose. Plasma glucose and insulin blood samples will be collected at 30, 60, 90, 120, [ADDRESS_911414] a measure of the 3-month average of plasma glucose levels. Secondary outcomes will be the 2-h glucose level and the Matsuda index (MI) of insulin sensitivity 
57. These measures will allow us 
to ascertain whether there was an improvement in glucose metabolism. The CRC regularly 
performs these tests and Drs. Knutson and Aleppo are experienced in their interpretation. As 
noted above, subjects who are identified as having T2DM 56 at the screening visit will be 
notified, excluded from study participation, and re ferred to a physician/clinic. Subjects who are 
identified as having prediabetes 56 at the screening visit will be notified, included in study 
participation if they meet all other inclusion criteria, and referred to a physician/clinic. [CONTACT_674499] 
will oversee these referrals. Subjects who begin diabetes treatment prior to the end of the study 
will be dropped, however, due to common delays in seeing a physician (over one month), this is unlikely to affect many subjects. If the original HbA1c screen suggested prediabetes but the fasting and/or 2-h glucose suggest diabetes, the subject will be retained in the study, but [CONTACT_674499] will discuss the results with the subject.  
Dim Light Melatonin Onset. Subjects will be prompted by [CONTACT_674475] 72 h, and alcohol/caffeine 24 h, before each laboratory session and will be breathalyzed on 
arrival. Lights in the collection room are dimmed (<5 lux) beginning 6.[ADDRESS_911415]’s habitual bedtime as determined from the baseline week of actigraphy. After [ADDRESS_911416] 
procedures 
58-61. Saliva samples are frozen until delivery to Rush where they are thawed, 
centrifuged, refrozen and shipped in dry ice to Solidphase, Inc. (ME) who performs direct RIA assay using standard commercially available ALPCO kits 
8,62. [CONTACT_409720] will calculate the 
DLMOs and a trained research assistant will confirm accuracy before results are unblinded. We 
will calculate DLMO threshold as the mean of 3 low daytime points plus 2 times the SD of the 3 
points as per consensus report 63. The morning light treatment will phase advance the DLMO by 
~1-[ADDRESS_911417] actigraphy (Act iwatch Spectrum, Philips, Inc.). Due to the 
unobtrusive nature of this device, habitual sleep behavior can be measured over weeks. [CONTACT_674500] has extensive experienc e working with actigraphy data 64-66. Actiwatch monitors feature 
digital integration, which is the most accurate measure of both movement level and intensity. Each subject will also complete a short sleep log every day, and call a time-stamped voice mail when they go to bed each night and when they wake up each morning 
58,67.  
Food Diary . Subjects will complete a 3-day food diary for the last [ADDRESS_911418].  Questionnaires. Sociodemographic information will be collected only once and will include age, sex, education, employment status and the MacArthur Socioeconomic Questionnaire 
68. 
Subjects will complete several questionnaires at both baseline and week 4 of the intervention, including, an assessment of physical activity (International Physical Activity Questionnaire – 
STU#: 00204710 
Version #: 10  Version Date:  05/03/2018 Page 8 of 19 
HRP-593 / v011017 Short Version), and health factors (self-rated health 69, Physical Health Questionnaire 70) in case 
of significant changes in health during the study. We will also include several sleep and 
circadian questionnaires: circadian preference based on the Horne-Ostberg Morningness-
Eveningness (“owl-lark”) questionnaire 71, Munich Chronotype Questionnaire, Pi[INVESTIGATOR_8326], and Epworth Sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_7110]. We will also administer  Cohen’s Perceived 
Stress Scale 72, and the Center for Epi[INVESTIGATOR_7307] - Depression Scale 52. Finally, we will 
include questionnaires to assess frequency of caffeinated beverage, alcohol and tobacco consumption. The Systematic Assessment for Treatment Emergent Effects questionnaire (SAFTEE) will be administered weekly to asse ss potential side effects of intervention.  
Questionnaire responses will be entered into the password-protected REDCap database and saved according to confidential study ID number.   
 
DATA AND SPECIMEN BANKING: 
N/A No data or specimen banking will occur.  
 
DATA AND SPECIMEN MANAGEMENT: 
Sample Size and Power Analysis 
We plan to enroll 34 subjects (50% female, age 35-70 y) with prediabetes. We conservatively estimate a 17% attrition rate (final n=28) which includes dropouts and noncompliance 
(noncompliance defined as <25% of morning light treatment, as per 
77). This attrition rate is 
based on [CONTACT_409720]’ light treatment trials (5% such attrition), and the work of others (4 week bright light treatment group 6% attrition 
77, 12 week bright light treatment group 19% attrition 78). 
Note that subjects who obtain only 25% of the prescribed active light (e.g. 15 min/day) are likely to obtain some benefit, as even only 15-[ADDRESS_911419] deviation (SD) of 9.0 mg/dl, which 
is the mean SD in a large sample of men and women with prediabetes 
82. Using these values for 
a two-tailed independent t-test, with a total of [ADDRESS_911420] 81% power (α=.05) to detect a change of 10 mg/dl, which is a clinically meaningful change and similar to 
that observed in a 2-week drug study 
83. Thus we are well powered with an anticipated final 
sample size of n=[ADDRESS_911421] a clinically meaningful change in fasting glucose. 
 
Data Analysis  
Aim 1:  For our primary analyses, we will examine the effect sizes in active treatment group. The 
analysis will use two-sided statistical tests and a nominal significance of 5%. Our primary analysis will focus on the pre-post measurements in the active group.  As a descriptive analysis, 
we will estimate the mean outcome measures at each time point for each subject and test time-
specific differences using non-parametric tests.  If we recruit sufficient subjects for the placebo 
condition, we will compare the effects in the two groups. 
 
Aim 2: To determine the extent to which circadian phase advances in the DLMO are related to 
improvements in glucose metabolism, we will first examine if the DLMO has changed 
significantly in the active light treatment gr oup (and compared to placebo if possible), and then 
STU#: 00204710 
Version #: 10  Version Date:  05/03/2018 Page 9 of 19 
HRP-593 / v011017 examining if these differences are correlated with changes in glucose metabolism measures.  
 
Exploratory Aim: In a similar analysis to Aim 2, we w ill examine possible alternative mediators 
(body fat, activity, total caloric intake, and sleep fragmentation [wrist actigraphy]) through which 
morning light treatment may impact glucose metabolism (fasting glucose, 2-h glucose, MI). We 
will measure body fat because it was reduced in two previous light studies (reviewed in A.2.). We will measure physical activity because light treatment has an energizing effect 
84. We will 
assess total caloric intake, as differences in circadian timing can impact diet 85. We do not 
expect changes in sleep duration as subjects will be instructed to maintain their habitual sleep duration during the treatment. However, a shift in circadian timing can impact sleep 
consolidation 
[ADDRESS_911422]-protected computers.  Data files 
and documents (with the exception of the consent form) will be stripped of identifying 
information and subjects will be identified only by a unique study ID code. All saliva samples will be deidentified using only the study ID code.   
Specimen Handling 
The saliva specimens will be stored in -20C freez ers and then transported in insulated travel 
packs to Rush University by [CONTACT_95002]. Once assayed they will be destroyed. They will 
be destroyed appropriately according to procedures regarding handling of biological specimens. 
 
 PROVISIONS TO MONITOR THE DATA TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF PARTICIPANTS: 
This study will recruit volunteers with prediabetes and study them for 5 weeks. Subjects will be assigned to one of two intervention groups: (1) active  morning light treatment with a 
commercially available Re-timer® or (2) placebo morning light treatment with dimmed Re-
timer®. This project is considered to be “minimal risk” because the probability and magnitude of 
harm or discomfort anticipated in the research are not greater than those ordinarily encountered 
in daily life or during the performance of rout ine physical and psychological examinations or 
tests.  
 
All adverse events, serious and non-serious, occurring during the course of the study will be 
collected, fully documented, and reported to the Northwestern University Internal Review Board 
(IRB) by [CONTACT_079], [CONTACT_562820]. For each adverse event, the investigator will 
provide the onset, duration, intensity and treatment required, outcome and action taken. In 
addition to adverse event reporting, the investigators will report a summary of the protocol 
findings, subject recruitment, drop-outs, and events to the IRB annually. The physiological 
studies will be conducted in the Northwestern CRU, and as such, will be overseen by [CONTACT_674476]. All data will be k ept confidential and in a locked cabinet. Only 
approved study personnel will have a ccess to study related documents.  
 
 
WITHDRAWAL OF PARTICIPANTS: 
Participants are free to choose to stop participation in the study at any time.  They will be 
explicitly told that choosing not to be in this study  or to stop being in this study will not result in 
any penalty to them or loss of benefit to which th ey are entitled.  Specifically, the choice to 
withdraw will not negatively affect the right to any present or future medical treatment to which

HRP-593 / v011017 they are otherwise entitled.  If participants withdraw, the procedure will immediately stop, they 
will be asked to fill out paperwork regarding monetary compensation for the completed portion of the study.  Compensation will be prorated on the number of visits completed as described in 
the consent form.  We will ask for the reason for withdrawal, but participants are not obligated to 
provide one. Their data will be included in analyses as appropriate. 
 
Participants may be taken off the study without consent if: 
 They are unable to meet the requirements of the study; 
 If they begin treatment for prediabetes before completion of study; 
 Their medical condition changes; 
 If the study is stopped. 
 
 
RISKS TO PARTICIPANTS: 
One potential risk is that subjects may experience some distress when sharing personal 
information during the two telephone screening calls and while completing questionnaires for the study. To reduce distress about public disclosure, the meaning of confidentiality will be explained. Subjects will be explicitly instruct ed that revealing deeply personal information, by 
[CONTACT_674477], is not considered part 
of the protocol and if revealed, will not be shared, recorded or disclosed to anyone. 
 The clinical procedures involve some discomfort associated with the finger stick screen for HbA1c and later venipuncture associated with the OGTT assessment. There might be slight bruising at the site, which will recover in a short period of time. There is also slight risk of inflammation of the vein or infection. However, the research assistant who will conduct the 
finger stick and our nurses who perform the OGTT procedures will be highly trained and thus 
these risks are minimal. The amount of blood wit hdrawn is minimized to prevent significant 
blood loss. Furthermore, a study physician ([CONTACT_674501]) will be available should any medical 
concerns arise. There is also the potential of discomfort from the equi pment placement of the 
wireless WatchPAT™ device used for the home sleep apnea screen. Efforts will be made to minimize this discomfort, with the research assistant first demonstrating the correct application 
of the WatchPAT™ device on themselves, followed by [CONTACT_674478] a test application in 
front of the research assistant, before the subject applies the device at home later that night (the 
screening visit will be scheduled to occur on a day in which the subject is available to do the home sleep apnea screen that night if they pass the screening visit).   Subjects will receive a 1 hour morning light tr eatment for 4 weeks. Morning light treatment is 
already used in clinical practice, such as for winter depression 
87-90 and circadian rhythm sleep 
disorders 91,92. Morning light treatment is considered safer than sunlight because there are no 
UV rays, and indeed no changes in extensive ophthalmologic examination were observed after up to 6 years of daily light treatment (in fall and winter) 
93. Morning light treatment is associated 
with some side effects, the most common being headache, eyestrain, nausea and agitation 90, 
but often these side effects spontaneously remit 90,94, and patients rarely discontinue due to side 
effects 94. A rare but serious side effect is mania in  bipolar patients who overexpose themselves 
to the light 90,[ADDRESS_911423] instructions to limit their light treatment to 1 hour/day. Additionally, the Re-
timer® device automatically turns off after 1 hour of use. Further, all subjects will be instructed to not permit family/friends to play with the Re-timers®, and to only turn the Re-timers® on 
during the scheduled time. Note that mania in response to morning light treatment is so rare that 
light treatment has even been clinically tested in bipolar patients and found to be safe 
95. The 
active light treatment will result in light intensities greater than most indoor light, but much dimmer than sunlight on a bright day (about 100,000 lux). The active Re-timer® used in this 
STU#: 00204710 
Version #: 10  Version Date:  05/03/2018 Page 11 of 19 
HRP-593 / v011017 study is commercially available and already in use in the general population. The Re-timer® 
meets international ultraviolet and blue light hazard safety standards (standard ICNIRP 7/99 and 
CIE S009/E: 2002, also known as international standard IEC [ZIP_CODE]/Ed. 1 published in 2006), 
and is safe (no UV light, no power in wavelengths <400nm). The placebo Re-timer® is also safe 
as the light has simply been dimmed. Finally, the circadian phase shifts (~1-2 hours) resulting from the active morning light treatment may lead to transient symptoms akin to jet lag after crossing 1-2 time zones, including transient sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008], fatigue and headache. These symptoms are similar to those experienced on a Monday morni ng after a late weekend. However, such ‘jet 
lag’ will be very short lived as the circadian phase shifts will likely complete within the first few 
days of morning light treatment. 
 There is the risk of loss of confidentiality, but as described below, procedures are in place to minimize this risk. There are no other known risks involved in any of the other measurement procedures. Participation is voluntary and subjects  may withdraw from the study at any time. 
 
 POTENTIAL BENEFITS TO PARTICIPANTS: 
All subjects will receive the results of the finger stick HbA1c at screening and [CONTACT_674499] will 
discuss the results with each subject as soon as possible. All subjects will receive the results from the home sleep apnea screen within [ADDRESS_911424] as soon as possible. Anyone who seeks treatment for OSA, even if AHI<15, 
will be excluded from the study (as part of intent-to-treat analysis the last observation will be 
carried over). If the original HbA1c screen suggested prediabetes but the fasting and/or 2-h glucose suggest diabetes, the subject will be retained in the study, but [CONTACT_674499] will discuss the results with the subject. The information gained from this study will help to develop a larger randomized clinical trial to test a novel intervention, morning light treatment, to reduce risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] T2DM. The risks are only minimal and the risk-to-benefit ratio is very small. Subjects 
have the option of droppi[INVESTIGATOR_674456]. 
 Metabolic disorders such as diabetes and prediabetes are highly prevalent in the U.S. The primary goal of this study is to test whether morning light treatment may be an effective and feasible intervention to reduce risk for T2DM. If our hypotheses are correct, morning light treatment could be a feasible, effective, safe and non-pharmacological intervention to reduce 
diabetes risk in millions of Americans.

  RECRUITMENT METHODS: 
Potential subjects will be recruited via digital and print advertising (e.g., flyers, poster, Doctor-to-
Patient Letter).Potential subjects may also be recruited online through Research Match and health registries (e.g., Women’s Health registry, NUCATS registry, and NMEDW) including but not limited to sites for professionals who see patients with early diabetes (prediabetes) or 
related conditions. Research Match is a secure online, national recruitment tool that is 
maintained by [CONTACT_50222]. ResearchMatch.org allows researchers to conduct feasibility or recruit potential study participants. Participants who are interested and released their contact [CONTACT_674480]. If participants cannot be reached via telephone the Research Match follow-up email will be sent to them via email. 
 
The Illinois Women's Health Registry was established and overseen by [CONTACT_78143]'s Women's Health Research Institute at the Feinberg School of Medicine to encourage investigator-initiated research targeting women's health. The role of the Registry is to facilitate the recruitment and identification of women who may be eligible to participate in IRB approved research being conducted at Northwestern University and other research institutions 
across the state of Illinois. 
 
The General Research Registry, overseen by [CONTACT_674481], includes people who are interested in 
participating in research at Northwestern and have consented to be contact[CONTACT_674482]. These potential participants will first be contact[CONTACT_204315], provided detailed study information, and if interested in participating, encouraged to complete a pre-screening questionnaire to confirm if they meet study inclusion 
criteria. The Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW) is also overseen by [CONTACT_674483]. It 
consists of a comprehensive database of clinical and research data. Data requests from EDW can yield potentially eligible subjects, to whom the research team can reach out.  Recruitment will also include advertising the study to current diabetes patients in order to recruit 
their potentially eligible family members. [CONTACT_674499], a co-investigator on this project, is an

Why am I being asked to take part in this research study ?
We 
are asking you to take part in this research study because you are a healthy adult between 
the 
ages of 40-65.
What should I  know about a research study ?
Someone will explain this research study to you.
Whether or not you take  part is up to you.
You can choose not to take part.
You can agree to take part and later change your mind.
Your decision will not be held against you.
You can ask all the questions you want before you decide.
Why 
is this research being done ?
The 
purpose of this  study is to determine if a morning light device can help to improve blood 
sugar levels in people with an early form of diabetes ("prediabetes").
How long will the research last and what will I need to do ?
We 
think you will be in the study for about 6 weeks, including the screening period. 
You 
will participate in a brief screening session which will include: a urine drug test, drawing a 
small amount 
of blood from your finger, wearing a device for 1 night on your hand/wrist to 
measure your sleep at home, and a single page sleep log to track your bed and wake times.
You will be asked to wear a wristwatch device at home for one week to measure your typi[INVESTIGATOR_674462]. 
You will be asked to complete questionnaires and food and sleep diaries.
You will also spend [ADDRESS_911431] an “oral glucose tolerance test,” which measures how your body uses sugar. An IV 
will be inserted into one arm and blood will be sampled every 30 minutes for 3 hours, totaling 
about 5 tablespoons of blood.
You will be given a light device to wear for 1 hour after waking up, everyday for 4 weeks. The 
device is worn on your head and delivers 
light to your eyes. It looks like large glasses, and can 
be worn over your eyeglasses if you wear them. It is easy to put on and to go about your daily 
morning activities while wearing it.  You will continue to wear the wristwatch device to measure 
sleep during this time and complete sleep and food diaries.Key Information: 
The 
first few pages of this document include a summary of this study to help you 
decide whether or not to participate. Detailed information is provided after the 
summary.

What 
happens if  I say “Yes, I want to be in this research”?
After reviewing this  consent form and discussing the details of the study with study personnel, 
there will be a brief screening session where we will take some blood and measure sleep (see 
"Screening" 
on the next page). After screening, the rest of the study will last 5 weeks and 
includes 6 separate, weekly visits to the laboratory (not counting this one). Two of these visits 
are overnight stays in our sleep laboratory. For the last 4 weeks of the study you will be asked 
to wear a light device on your head (ReTimer ®) for one hour each morning.Detailed Information:

Page 3 of 12 Version Date:  04/09/2018Pre-screening
You have already completed  pre-screening over the telephone or in person, which included 
asking about previously diagnosed conditions, such as diabetes.  We also had you complete 
two questionnaires that screen for sleep apnea (the Berlin and the STOP-BANG).  People with 
sleep apnea are not eligible for this study.
You provided verbal consent  over the phone to record your bed times and wake times before 
coming in for the screening visit.
Screening:
You will have the following tests and procedures today to see if you can be in the study:
You will be asked to provide a urine sample which will be tested for recreational 
drug use. 
Recreational drugs interfere with the laboratory tests used to process 
saliva and blood samples and are strictly prohibited for participation in this study.
We will stick your finger to draw a small amount of blood to see if you have an early form 
of 
diabetes and to see if you are healthy enough to give more blood in the study. If you 
do not have an early form of diabetes, called pre-diabetes, you will not be able to be in 
this study. 
You will be asked to wear a device overnight on your wrist and hand to measure your 
sleep at 
home for one night.  You will be given instructions about how to do this. 
You will be given a single page sleep log to continue tracking your bed times and wake 
times 
until you come in to pi[INVESTIGATOR_674463] 1, the Start-up visit, 
after which you will be filling out sleep diaries to record this information. 
If the results of these tests match what is needed for this study you will be allowed to participate. 
You 
will then be scheduled for the full study. 
Start-up visit: 
We will review the sleep recording done at home and if you qualify we will provide you with the 
equipment 
and materials necessary for week 1.  At this visit, you will be given a wrist activity 
monitor (similar to a wristwatch called an “Actiwatch”), sleep diaries, and food diaries.  
Week 1: 
During this week, you will wear the wrist monitor all day and night and complete sleep diaries 
each morning.  
The activity monitor is water resistant.  It can be worn while showering, but not 
to be kept underwater for long periods of time (over 30 minutes).  Please do not wear while 
swimming. 
In addition, you will complete several questionnaires and on the last 3 days of this week, you will 
complete 
a 3-day food diary that asks for both the amount and types of food eaten and the time 
of your meals and snacks.
Laboratory visit #1:  
At the end of the week, you will spend approximately 20-24 hours in our laboratory.  We will tell 
you the 
specific time to arrive, but it will be early afternoon. Dinner will be provided. Saliva (spit) 
samples will be collected every half hour in the late afternoon and evening until bedtime. You 
will continue to wear the wrist activity monitor. 
In the morning, body fat will be measured by [CONTACT_674489].  
Then, 
you will have an “oral glucose tolerance test” (OGTT), which measures how well your

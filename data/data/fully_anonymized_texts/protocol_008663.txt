7 1 INTRODUCTION  
1.1 STUDY  OBJECTIVES  
1.1.1 Primary  Objective  
To evaluate toxicity, including peripheral neuropathy, of carfilzomib, lenalidomide, and 
dexamethasone (CRd) in untreated MM patients  
1.1.2 Secondary Objectives  
• To determine best response rates according to International Myeloma Working Group 
criteria after [ADDRESS_765483] combination therapy  
• To determine progression free survival (PFS)  
• To determine duration of response (DOR)  
• To determine overall survival (OS)  
• To evaluate biological activity of carfilzomib and correlate to clinical outcomes , 
including g ene expression profiling on pre - and post -carfilzomib exposure bone marrow 
samples  
• To assess the impact of minimal residual disease by [CONTACT_582107]/CT in 
relation to outcome  
1.1.3 Exploratory Objectives  
• To assess MRD detection by [CONTACT_582108], exome sequencing, and 
PD-1/PD -L1 expression in the bone marrow compartment  
• To evaluate radiographic changes (signal intensity) in bone marrow heterogeneity and 
focal lesions by [CONTACT_239907] (DW -MRI) over time.  
• To evaluate radio graphic changes (FDG avidity) in bone marrow heterogeneity and focal 
infiltration by [CONTACT_10052]/CT  overtime . 
1.2 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
1.2.1 Introduction  
Multiple myeloma (MM) is characterized by [CONTACT_582109], affecting an estimated 20,000 people annually (1).  Disease hallmarks include 
presence of monoclonal protein in serum or urine and features of end orga n damage, including 
hypercalcemia, renal insufficiency, anemia, and bone lytic lesions (2).  MM remains incurable 
with an estimated median survival of 3 -4 years with conventional therapi[INVESTIGATOR_582069] (3, 4). 
1.2.2 Proteasomes and Bortezomib  
Proteasomes play a critical role in protein turnover and degradation, thereby [CONTACT_582110], signal transduction, apoptosis, and stress responses.  The 26S 
proteasome complex consists of the 20S barrel –like core and 19S regulating component.  The  
20S proteasome has three main catalytic domains that contribute to protein breakdown:  
chymotryptic -like activity site, tryptic -like activity site, and caspase -like activity site (5).  
Inhibiting proteasomes in malignant cells lead s to buildup of ubiquinated proteins, resulting in 
eventual cell d eath.  Such inhibitor effects likely extend beyond just a simple overaccumulation 
of cell waste.  Rather, proteasome inhibitors also exert direct effects on the myeloma 
microenvironment and enable neoplastic cells to “re -direct” cell proliferation/apoptoti c signaling 
while overcoming drug resistance mechanisms.  
Abbreviated Title:   CRd in Newly Diagnosed MM  
Version Date:  03/27/[ADDRESS_765484] in ini tial treatment of transplant and non -transplant candidates, as well as in 
relapsed/refractory disease settings (6, 7).  A recent phase I/II study shows promising efficacy of 
the novel combination: bortezomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone  in newly diagnosed MM 
patients, with 74% of subjects achieving very good partial response (VGPR) or better (8).  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_239827], bortezomib and others pose certain cl inical 
challenges.  Bortezomib drug toxicity is common with side effects including neuropathy, GI 
distress (diarrhea), myelosuppression , thrombocytopenia and herpes zoster re -activation.  
Bortezomib associated peripheral neuropathy can be experienced in  up to 33% (Grade 1 and 2) 
and up to 18% (Grade 3 and 4) of newly diagnosed MM patients (9).  In the aforementioned 
phase I/II study, with combination bortezomib, lenali domide, and dexamethasone, 80% of 
treated patients experienced sensory neuropathy all grades (8).  In addition, as increasing numbers 
of patients are treated with novel agents, drug resistance and refractoriness seem to present a 
significant dilemma.  Myeloma patients refractory or resistant to bortezomib and at least one 
IMID (lenalid omide or thalidomide) demonstrate median overall survival and event free survival 
of 6 months and 1 month, respectively (10). 
1.2.3 Investigational Drug Carfilzomib  
Carfilzomib is a tetrapeptide ketoepoxide -based irreversible inhibitor that forms a covalent bond 
with N-terminal threonine residue of the chymotrypsin domain.  Compared to bortezomib, 
carfilzomib demonstrates equal potency but greater selectivity for the chymotrypsin activity site 
over the trypt ic and caspase domains.  
Chemical Structure of Carfilzomib  
 
Carfilzomib is less reactive to non -proteasome proteases compared to bortezomib, likely 
contributing to lower levels of neuropathy and myelosuppressio n(11-13).  In vitro models 
suggest carfilzomib has activity against bortezomib resistant myeloma cell lines (12).  
Carfilzomib can a lso work synergistically with dexamethasone to enhance tumor cell death(12).  
A number of phase I and phase II studies are currently investigating carfilzomib toxicity and 
efficacy in MM.   
As of Ju ly 2019, carfilzomib has been examined in approximately 11,[ADDRESS_765485] been 4 cases of Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML)  
possibly linked to Carfilzomib.

9 [IP_ADDRESS]  Phase I Carfilzomib  Monotherapy  
A Phase 1 clinical trial, PX -171-002, testing carfilzomib in  subjects with relapsed/refractory 
hematologic malignancies, is being completed (14).  During the dose escalation portion of the 
trial, 36 subjects received carfilzomib on Days 1, 2 , 8, 9, 15, and 16 of a 28 -day cycle.  20 
subjects with MM were enrolled on the study.   
No dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) were observed in the initial seven cohorts (doses ranged from 
1.2 to 15 mg/m2) of three subjects each.  At the 20 mg/m2 dose level, one of eight patients had a 
Grade 3 renal failure at Cycle 1, Day 2 which was considered possibly related to study drug and 
lasted for six days.  The patient continued on study for the remainder of Cycle 1 before having 
disease progression.   At the 27 mg/ m2 dose level, one of six subjects experienced a DLT during 
Cycle 1, consisting of severe hypoxia with pulmonary infiltrates following Day 2 of dosing.  In 
subjects where the 27 mg/m2 dose was efficacious, a “first dose effect” was seen that included a 
constellation of findings that appeared to be the clinical sequelae of rapid tumor lysis syndrome 
(TLS) and/or cytokine release.  This effect was notable for fever, chills, and/or rigors occurring 
during the evening following the first day of infusion.  On th e second day, three of five subjects 
with MM experienced an increase in creatinine to Grade [ADDRESS_765486] with the DLT.  
This elevation was rapi[INVESTIGATOR_582070].  Interestingly, all three subjects had a rapid decline in serum 
and/or urine M -protein levels .  There were no consistent changes in potassium, calcium, 
phosphorous, or uric acid levels although some increases in LDH and other markers of tumor 
lysis we re noted.   Because of the possible TLS and reversible creatinine elevations, hydration 
and very -low dose dexamethasone prophylaxis were instituted in subsequent studies and have 
essentially eliminated clinically significant TLS/creatinine elevations and th e other “first -dose” 
effects.    
Four of the twenty MM patients achieved a partial response (PR), one of two at the 15  mg/m2 
dose, one of six at the 20 mg/m2 dose, and two of five at the 27 mg/m2 dose.   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Phase II Carfilzomib Monotherapy  
Two Phase 2 clinical studies are ongoing with carfilzomib in MM patients, PX -171-003-A0 
(N=46) in relapsed and refractory MM and PX -171-004 (N=39)  in relapsed MM. (15, 16) In both 
studies, patients were dosed with 20 mg/m2 on Days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and [ADDRESS_765487] 
been reported  including in >350 additional patients with relapsed or refractory MM treated in 
ongoing Ph ase II studies.    
A “stepped up” dosing schedule, referred to as 20/27 mg/m2, has subsequently been incorporated 
into the PX -171-003 study (referred to as PX -171-003-A1) in order to maximize the clinical 
benefit of carfilzomib.  Patients receive 20 mg/m2 for the first cycle and 27 mg/m2 thereafter.  
The study completed enrolment  of [ADDRESS_765488] y, with 
Grade 3/4 renal impairment droppi[INVESTIGATOR_86286] 2.2% in A1(from 15% in A0), most likely due to 
hydration and very low dose dexamethasone.  The other most common adverse events were 
similar to the A0 portion of the study.  Treatment -emergent peripheral neuro pathy remains low 
on this portion of the study with 15% Grade 1/2 and one (0.7%) Grade 3/ 4 event reported to date 
Abbreviated Title:   CRd in Newly Diagnosed MM  
Version Date:  03/27/2020  
 
10 on PX -171-003-A1(15).  In addition, anemia rates in the PX -171-003-A1 (higher dose) were 
lower than those reported in the PX -171-003–A0 portion of the study, possibly indic ating that 
the higher dose of carfilzomib is achieving better clearing of neop lastic cells in the bone marrow 
allowing superior normal marrow reconstitution.   Rates of thrombocytopenia and neutropenia 
were similar in the two cohorts, with Grade 3 neutropenia in ~5% without any Grade 4 
neutropenia to date. (15)  
1.2.4 Investigational Drug Lenalidomide  
REVLIMID® (lenalidomide), a thalidomide analogue, is an immunomodulatory agent with anti-
angiogenic properties.  The chemical name [CONTACT_832] 3 -(4-amino -1-oxo 1,3 -dihydro -2H-isoindol -2-yl) 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_119510] -2,6-dione and it has the following chemical structure:  
Chemical Structure of Lenalidomide  
 
The mechanism of action of lenalidomide remains to be fully characterized. Although the exact 
antitumor mechanism of action of lenalidomide is unknown, a number of mechanisms are 
postulated to be responsible for lenalidomide’s activity against MM.  Lenalidomide has been 
shown to increase T cell proliferation,  which leads to an increase in IL -[ADDRESS_765489] 
in MM cell lines and in MM cells of patients resistant to melphalan, doxorubicin and 
dexamethasone.  Revlimid® is approved in combination with dexamethasone for the treatm ent of 
patients with MM that have received at least one prior therapy. (17, 18) The drug has also been 
studied in newly diagnosed patients in combination with low -dose dexamethasone, as well as with 
bortezomib and dexamethasone as mentioned earlier. (8, 19)   
1.2.5 Phase I Combination Therapy Carfilzomib, Lenalidomide, and Dexamethasone in 
Refractory/Relapsed MM  
PX-171-006 is an ongoing Phase 1b study in patients with relapsed MM in which carfilzomib is 
administered in combination with lenalidomide (Revlimid®) and dexamethasone. (20) “Low -
dose” dexamethasone 40 mg/day is given on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 in all cases.  Carfilzomib is 
administered IV on Days 1, 2, 7, 8 , 15, and 16; lenalidomide is administered PO  on Days 1 
through 21.  Enrollment has closed in this study, and no MTD was reached.  The maximum per 
protocol doses of carfilzomib (20/27mg/m2) with lenalidomide 25mg and low dose 
dexamethasone are being used.  After 8 patients tolerated these doses well , an additional 44 
patients were enrolled in an “expansion ” cohort at this level.  To date, 40 patients were treated in 
cohorts 1 -6 and 44  in the cohort 6 expansion. 27/32 patients in cohorts 1 –5 are evaluable fo r 
safety and 29/[ADDRESS_765490] been observed. No treatment emergent fatigue, neuropathy, or thrombotic events ≥ Grade 
(G) 3 were observed. Hematological AEs ≥G3 (thrombocytopenia [n =6], anemia [n=4], and

1.2.6 Phase I Combination Therapy Carfilzomib, Lenalidomide, and Dexamethasone in Newly 
Diagnosed MM  
Results of a phase I /II study in newly diagnosed MM patients was  recently published evaluating 
carfilzomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone. (21)   Carfilzomib was the only escalating agent, 
ranging from 20 mg/m2 (dose level 1), 27 mg/m2 (dose level 2), to a recently amended dose of 
36 mg/m2 (dose level 3) based on recent toxicity assessments.  Lenalidomide was administered 
at 25 mg PO (days 1 -21) while dexamethasone was given at 40/20 (cycles 1 -4/5-8) mg PO 
weekly.  
The study enrolled 53 patients , 4 patients at 20 mg/m2, 13 at 27 mg/m2, 18 at 36 mg/m2 and 
additional 18 in the expanded phase 2 cohort at 36 mg/m2.  One patient had a DLT at dose level 
27 mg/m2 with an epi[INVESTIGATOR_43180] -febrile neutropenia.  Two patients experienced DLT at 36 
mg/m 2 dose level with epi[INVESTIGATOR_582071].  Data indicated a dose 
dependent trend of increasing DLTs, however, the DLT probability was estimated to be less than 
20% set for the MTD using the TITE -CRM algorithm.  The MPD of 36 mg/m2 was sele cted as 
the expansion dose for phase II. Hematological AEs ≥G3 ( were thrombocytopenia 17% , anemia 
21% , and neutropenia 17%).  Non-hematologic AEs ≥G3 include hypophosphatemia 25%, 
hyperglycemia 23%, DVT/PE 9%, rash 8%, and elevated liver function test 8%.  Peripheral 
neuropathy was experienced by 23% and limited in severity to Grade 1(17%) and 2 (6%).  There 
was no Grade 3 or 4 peripheral neuropathy reported.   After a median of 12 cycles  of treatment, 
62% achieved at least near CR and 42% achieved a stringe nt CR. 
1.2.7 Minimal Residual Disease ( MRD ) in MM 
Current response criteria , which are defined by M -spi[INVESTIGATOR_2531], plasma cell burden, and abnormal free 
light chains,  are often limited i n predicting clinical response and duration of response.  MRD in 
MM is still under c urrent investigation.  Immunophenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_239829] -parametric flow cytometry has prognostic value in the post -autologous stem cell 
transplantation setting. (22) At day [ADDRESS_765492] flow status had longer OS (median 
not reached vs. 89 months, p = 0.002).   Other techniques, such as, polymerase chain reaction 
(PCR) of Ig heavy chain (IGH) rearrangements and light chain genes have also been employed in 
Abbreviated Title:   CRd in Newly Diagnosed MM  
Version Date:  03/27/[ADDRESS_765493] prognostic significance in showing prolonged PFS after 
intensive therapy. (23)  
FDG -PET CT has been valuable at localizing intramedullary and extrame dullary disease in 
multiple myeloma.  FDG uptake is able to distinguish between active lesions and chronic 
disease, scar tissue, necrotic tissue, radiation changes, and other benign disease .  The sensitivity 
of FDG -PET in detecting myelomatous involvement is approximately 85%, and its specificity is 
approximately 90%. (24)   
Incorporating such techniques into prospective clinical trials may have a role in evaluating 
response to therapy.       
1.2.8 Proposed Study Investigation with Correlative Studies  
Given carfilzomib’s potent anti -myeloma activity and lack of peripheral neuropathy , we propose 
a phase II investigation of combination therapy (Cycles 1 -8 carfilzomib, lenalidomide, 
dexamethasone) in newly diagnosed MM patients followed by [CONTACT_582111] (days 1 -21 of 28 day cycle) for [ADDRESS_765494] 3 drug -combination demonstrates a rate of grade 3 or worse neurologic 
toxicity lower than 10%  in the first two completed cycles .  After 4 cycles, transplant eligible 
patients will undergo autologous stem cell harvesti ng.  After 8 cycles, patients achieving SD or 
better will proceed to extended dosing with lenalidomid e.  Patients not achieving SD will be off 
treatment.  Response criteria is outlined in S ection  5.3.  Proposed correlative studies include 
gene expression profiling on purified CD 138 + pre - and post - carfilzomib plasma cells, 
identification of potential biomarkers (blood, urine, bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_4026]) , proteasome 
quantification and activity , ubiquination assays, and effects on downstream signaling targets.  
Patients will also undergo evaluation for minimal residual disease at regular interval time points, 
using multi -parametric flow cytometry, FDG PET-CT, and detection of clonality using heavy

FDG -PET CT has been valuable at localizing intramedullary and extramedullary disease in MM. 
FDG uptake is able to distinguish between active lesions and chronic disease, scar tissue, necrotic 
tissue, radiation changes, and other benign disease. The sensitivity o f FDG -PET in detecting 
myelomatous involvement is approximately 85%, and its specificity is approximately 90%.  Along the 
lines of more advanced imaging techniques, DW -MRI has recently been found as a potential 
complementary imaging modality that focusses o n the actual myeloma plasmacytoma disease rather 
than subsequent bone destruction. The MY -RADS group state that because skeletal survey and CT 
predominantly help to detect the destructive effects of myeloma on trabecular and cortical bone 
rather than disea se within the bone marrow space, sensitivity and capability  as a restaging tool are 
inherently limited. Myeloma infiltrates within bone marrow can be observed on CT if they lie within 
the marrow spaces adjacent to fatty bone marrow. However, in trabecular bone spaces ( i.e. vertebral 
bodies), myeloma infiltrates are difficult to evaluate given factors including the trabeculae, 
degenerative changes, benign lesions, and osteoporosis. In contrast, MRI allows direct imaging of the 
bone marrow given its superb se nsitivity, soft -tissue contrast, and early detection of focal myeloma 
lesions. Although PET/CT can also detect myeloma lesions, MRI is more sensitive especially with 
newer techniques, i.e. DW -MRI, which have shown a sensitivity of 77% compared to 47% for 
PET/CT. Current whole -body MRI protocols can incorporate DW -MRI sequences that are sensitive 
to cellular density and viability and are important for disease detection and monitoring. Another 
benefit of DW -MRI sequences is that they are quick to perform (~45  minutes) and interpret. Finally,

13 the relationship of apparent diffusion coefficient values with cell density has the potential to assess 
response to treatment and response heterogeneity prior to changes in lesion size. The recent MY -
RADS recommendations w ere published in an attempt to promote standardization and decrease 
variations in the acquisition, interpretation, and reporting of whole -body MRI and allow better 
response assessments across cancer centers. MY -RADS recommendations require validation withi n 
clinical trials, including assessments of reproducibility and therefore we will be guided by [CONTACT_582112]’s recommendations especially in regard to MRI data acquisition and analysis protocols .  
1.2.9 Continuation of Lenalidomide  
Since the initiation of the protocol new data has been published regarding the efficacy and safety 
of extended dosing with  lenalidomide in multiple myeloma patients.  Three double blind 
randomized control trials were published in the same May 2012 issue of  NEJM showing that 
patients receiving extended dosing with  lenalidomide (10 -15 mg) after induction type regimens 
have a significant progression free survival benefit in the lenalidomide therapy arms (24-26).  
Two studies (McCarthy et al. and Attal et al.) were conducted after autologous HSCT and one 
study (Palumbo et al.) assessed transplant ineligible patients after induction therapy with 
melphalan, lenalidomide and prednisone.  Importantly, McCarthy and colleagues showed an 
overall survival benefit in patients receiving lenalidomide compared to placebo (15% vs. 23%, p 
= 0.03) (26).  A small increased risk of secondary primary malignancies was noted in the 
lenalidomide groups compared to  the placebo groups in all three trials.  However, it should be 
noted that such a risk has been well known and established in multiple myeloma patients 
receiving alkylator therapy, such as melphalan (27, 28).  All three of the aforementioned 
randomized trials used lenalidomide after melphalan exposure, a significant and notable 
difference between our trial (11 -C-0221) and theirs.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_582073] , post ad hoc analysis for all three trials with second malignancies being sc ored as 
“events” still showed a significant  event free survival  benefit  for lenalidomide arms compared to 
placebo (24-26, 29). 
In accord with these recent publications and lack of alkylator exposure in our protocol using 
CRd, we increased lenalidomide [ADDRESS_765495] 20/[ADDRESS_765496] 20 patients, none developed ≥  grade [ADDRESS_765497] responses with a 
median of 7 cycles showed 15/20(75%) nCR/sCR, 2/20(10%) VGPR, 2/ 20 (10%) PR, and 1/20

non-hematologic toxicities include: LFT elevation (20%), fatigue (15%), rash/pruritus (15%), 
dyspnea (10%), CHF (10%), general disorders and administration site conditions  (5%), mood 
alterations (5%), and electrolyte disturbances (5% ).  Patients with ≥ grade 3 hematologic 
toxicities include:  lymphopenia (60%), and anemia (5%).

3 STUDY IMPLEMENTATION  
3.1 STUDY DESIGN  
• Patients with newly diagnosed MM will be enrolled on the Phase II study and treated 
with 3 drug combination (Cycles 1 -8 carfilzomib, lenalidomide, dexamethasone)  
followed by [CONTACT_582113] . 
• After receiving first 4 cycles, patients who are considered to be eligible  for subsequent 
high dose therapy/autologous stem cell transplant  (ASCT)  will undergo autologous stem 
cell harvesting  for potential use in the future. In accord with current clinical stand ards, 
the decision whether a given patient is eligible for subsequent high  dose therapy/ASCT, 
or not, will be based on a clinical assessment conducted by [CONTACT_582114] . 
• For patients who choose to undergo stem cell h arvest , next cycle may be delayed for up 
to 5 weeks.  
• After 8 cycles, patients achieving SD or better will proceed to extended dosing  phase I of 
lenalidomide  (Days 1 -21 of 28 day cycle)  for [ADDRESS_765510] the option to continue 
lenalidomide as clinically indicated for an additional year on extended dosing phase II . 
• Patients not achieving SD will be off treat ment.  
• Patients will be enrolled on study to determine if the CRd 3 drug -combination 
demonstrates a rate of grade 3 or worse neurologic toxicity of 10% or lower  in the first 
two completed cycles .  A rate greater than 10% will be considered excessive.

20 • If a dose of lenalidomide is missed, it should be taken as soon as possible on the 
same day.  If it is missed for the entire day, it shoul d not be made up.  
• Patients who take more than the prescribed dose of lenalidomide should be 
instructed to seek emergency medical care if needed and contact [CONTACT_92220].   
• Lenalidomide (Revlimid®) will be provided to research subjects for the du ration of 
their participation in this trial at no charge to them or their insurance providers.

Celgene Corporation.  Per standard REMS ® requirements all physicians who 
prescribe lenalid omide for research subjects enrolled into this trial, and all research 
subjects enrolled into this trial, must be registered in and must comply with all 
requirements of the REMS ® program.  Prescriptions must be filled within 7 days.  
Only enough  lenalidomi de for one cycle of therapy will be supplied to the patient 
each cycle . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Dexamethasone  
• Cycle 1:  20 mg oral or IV on days 2, 8, 9, 15, 16, 22, and 23  
• Cycle 2 -4:  20 mg oral or IV on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, 16, 22, and 23  
• Cycle 5 -8:  10 mg oral or IV on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, 16, 22, and 23  
3.2.3 In Cycle 1, the following adjustments to the dosing schema will be implemented:  
• Cycle 1 Day 1, carfilzomib will be adminstered alone.  
• Patients will be admitted and observed as an inpatient while receiving Cycle 1 Day 1 
and 2 therapy.   
• Carfilzomib will be given at a lower dose of 20 mg/m2 on Days 1 and 2 of Cycle 1.   
• Lenalidomide and Dexamethasone will not be given on day 1  
• Bone marrow biopsy with aspi[INVESTIGATOR_582076] 1 Day 
2   
• Hydration wi ll be administered prior and subsequent to carfilzomib dosing.  
1) Oral hydration :  All subjects must be well hydrated (i.e., volume replete).  Begin 
oral hydration equal to approximately 30 mL/kg/day (~6 –8 cups of liquid per 
day), starting [ADDRESS_765511] and documented by [CONTACT_582115]; treatment is to be delayed or withheld if 
oral hydration is not deemed to be satisfactory.  
2) IV hydration:  500 mL (250 mL before & 250 mL after carfilzomib) OR 1000 
mL (500 mL before & after  carfilzomib ) of normal saline or other appropriate IV 
fluid formulation must be given before and after each carfilzomib dose during 
Cycle 1  D1 and D2 .  Total volume will be determined at the discretion of 
clinician and volume status of patient.  If lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) or uric 
acid is elevated at Cycle 2, Day 1, then the recommended IV hydration should be 
repeated for Cycle 2.  The goal of  the hydration program is to maintain robust 
urine output, (e.g., ≥ 2 L/day).  Subjects should be monitored periodically during 
this period for evidence of fluid overload.  
3) In subjects considered to be still at risk for TLS at completion of Cycle 1, 
hydrati on should be continued into  subsequent  cycles  if clinically indicated

4 CONCOMITANT MEDICATI ONS/MEASURES  
4.1 TUMOR LYSIS SYNDROME  
4.1.1 Hydration and Fluid Monitoring:  
• Oral hydration :  All subjects must be well hydrated (i.e., volume replete).  Begin oral 
hydration equal to approximately 30 mL/kg/day (~6 –8 cups of liquid per day), starting 
[ADDRESS_765533] and documented by [CONTACT_432671]; treatment is to be delayed or withheld if oral hydration is not deemed to be 
satisfactory.  
Abbreviated Title:   CRd in Newly Diagnosed MM  
Version Date:  03/27/2020  
 
32 • IV hydration:  500 mL (250 mL before & 250 mL after carfilzomib) OR 1000 mL (500 
mL before & 500 mL after carfilzomib ) of normal saline or other ap propriate IV fluid 
formulation must be given before and after each carfilzomib dose during Cycle 1  D1 
and D2 .  Total volume will be determined at the discretion of clinician and volume 
status of patient.  If lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) or uric acid is elev ated at Cycle 2, 
Day 1, then the recommended IV hydration should be repeated for Cycle 2.  The goal 
of the hydration program is to maintain robust urine output, (e.g., ≥ 2 L/day).  Subjects 
should be monitored periodically during this period for evidence o f fluid overload.  
• In subjects considered to be still at risk for TLS at completion of Cycle 1, hydration 
should be continued into  subsequent  cycles  if clinically indicated.   
4.1.2 Laboratory Monitoring:  
• Appropriate c hemistries, including creatinine, and complete blood counts (CBC) with 
platelet count  should be obtained and reviewed prior to carfilzomib  dosing.  Results of 
laboratory studies must be reviewed and deemed acceptable prior to administering the 
carfilzomib dose.   
• Subjects with laboratory abnormalities consistent with lysis of tumor cells (e.g., serum 
creatinine ≥ 50% increase, LDH ≥ 2 -fold increase, uric acid ≥ 50% increase, phosphate 
≥ 50% increase, potassium ≥ 30% increase, calcium ≥ 20% decrease) prior t o dosing 
should not receive the scheduled dose  
4.1.3 Clinical Monitoring:   
• Signs and symptoms indicative of TLS, such as fevers, chills/rigors, dyspnea, nausea, 
vomiting, muscle tetany, weakness, or crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007], seizures, and decreased urine output.  
• Patients will be admitted to the inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_239853] 1 
Days 1 and 2 of therapy.  
4.1.4 Management:  
• If TLS occurs, cardiac rhythm, fluid, and serial laboratory monitoring should be 
instituted.  Correct electrolyte abnormalities, monitor renal f unction and fluid balance, 
and administer therapeutic and supportive care, including dialysis, as clinically 
indicated.  
• All cases of TLS must be reported to [COMPANY_010]  as a Serious Adverse Event (SAE) 
through the normal process within 24  hours of the clinical s ite becoming aware of the 
event.  
4.1.5 Optional medication for high risk  TLS patients:  
• Allopurinol is optional and will be prescribed at the Investigator’s discretion.  These 
subjects may receive allopurinol 300  mg PO BID (Cycle 1 Day -2, Day -1), continuing 
for 2 days after Cycle 1 Day 1 (total of 4 days), then reduce dose to 300 mg PO QD, 
continuing through Day 17 of Cycle 1.  Allopurinol dose should be adjusted according 
to the package insert.  Subjects who do not tolerate allopurinol should be discussed with 
the Lead Principal Investigator .

4.2.3 Bispho sphonate T herapy  
Approved bispho sphonate therapy ( zoledron ic acid or pamidronate) is allowed.  Patients will be 
monitored for renal function and osteonecrosis of the jaw.  Patients may require prior evaluation 
from dental specialist before instituting bisphosphonates.    
4.3 HYPERCALCEMIA  
Patients may receive treatment for hypercalcemia including hydration, bispho sphonates, 
furosemide, steroids, calcitonin, etc.  
4.4 TRANSFUSIONS /GROWTH FACTORS  
• Subjects may receive RBC or platelet transfusions if clinically indicated .   
• Subjects may receive support ive care with erythropoietin or darbopoetin .

The correlative NGS assays to be performed will be dependent on final agreement in 
investigating mutually important questions of interest with our collaborators.  These 
include but ar e not limited to all or some of the following but are all optional:  
1. T-cell receptor  repertoire  (immunoseq): More recently research in the literature has 
shown that patients most likely to benefit from immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_582089] -tumor T cell clonality. Lenalidomide is an immunomodulatory 
and therefore it is important to analyze this along with immune subsets below in 
Abbreviated Title:   CRd in Newly Diagnosed MM  
Version Date:  03/27/2020  
 
37 SMM. NGS DNAseq will be used to analyze the VDJ sequence of T -cells to 
determine clonality.  Input source may be PBMC or whole blood and approximately 
2 ug of input gDNA will be needed which will amount to a whole blood collection 
of two 10 ml EDTA tubes. Collection time points include the following milestones, 
baseline, C8 or CR, 1 and 2 years , and during follow up phase . 
2. Germline single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) and copy number variations 
(CNV) DNAseq: Whole exome or genome sequencing will be performed on 
peripheral blood to determine baseline germline SNPs and CNVs. Whole blood 
(one 10 mL EDTA tube) sample will be collected at baseline for germline DNA 
extraction. This DNA will be used to analyze and compare germline vs. 
somatic/tumor genetic alterations based on sequence data. Furthermore, germline 
normal polymorphic variation will be analyzed as genome -wide associ ation study 
(GWAS ) to determine whether certain normal variations predispose patients with 
treated SMM to progress to biochemical or overt symptomatic disease. 
Additionally, these germline variations may be analyzed for association with 
treatment related a dverse events.  
3. ctDNA: Targeted DNAseq will be performed on ctDNA for assessment of minimal 
residual disease (MRD). In addition to the VDJ targeted commercial assay to 
determine presence of the malignant clone , the library will also include other known 
recurrent genetic aberations . Approximately  45% of myeloma patients have 
hyperdiploidy of one of the odd numbered chrom osomes, the other 45% have 
specific translocations/deletions , well characterized , including translocations of 
6;14, 11;14, 4;14, 14;16, 16;18 , 17p del , and cMYC .  Therefore, the assay will 
focus on both VDJ as with other hematologic malignancies and recurr ent genetic 
alterations similar to the approach used in solid malignancies. Blood collection will 
involve two 10 mL EDTA tubes.  
4. Gene expression profiling: RNAseq will be performed on CD138+ myeloma cells 
and correlated with DNAseq results. Additionally, pe ripheral blood/PBMC will 
analyzed for immune related signatures. One 10 mL EDTA tube will be used for 
this purpose.

Abbreviated Title:   CRd in Newly Diagnosed MM  
Version Date:  03/27/[ADDRESS_765546] at progression.   
[IP_ADDRESS].2  Procedures  
Prior to 18F -FDG PET/CT imaging, the subject will have fasted and not received any sugar 
containing substance (i.e., glucose, sucrose, d extrose) for [ADDRESS_765547] from 
the CC or another accredited lab performed on the day of the scan or the day before the scan.   
18F-FDG, [18F] -fluorodeoxyglucose is an FDA approved radiopharmaceutical.  Immediately 
prior to injection, the subject’s blood glucose leve l will be evaluated via finger stick.  Non -
diabetic subjects with fasting blood glucose levels above 150 mg/dl may be rescheduled at the 
discretion of the PI.  Subjects will be asked to refrain from excessive physical exertion for the 24 
hours prior to inj ection.   
Patients will report to the NCI clinic on the day of the F -18 PET/CT scan and peripheral venous 
access will be obtained (most commonly via IV in the antecubital fossa).  The 18F -FDG 
injection procedure will be injected and be followed by a ~20 ml  saline (sodium chloride IV 
infusion 0.9% w/v) flush over a period of ~[ADDRESS_765548] -administration for any reaction (e.g., bleeding, hematoma, redness, or infection).  
Whole body (vertex to toes) static PET /CT imaging will be performed beginning at 
approximately [ADDRESS_765549] injection per PET/CT standard operating procedures.  The patient will 
be instructed to maintain good hydration in order to reduce the radiation dose.  
[IP_ADDRESS].3  Research Radiation Exposure  
The radi ation dose from the procedure will be a maximum of 2.1 rem per year; this is within the 
RSC guidelines of 5.0 rem per year for adults.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  DW-MRI 
[IP_ADDRESS].1  Schedule  
We plan to obtain DW -MRI scans on patients on an annual basis through completion of follow up  for 
comparison with PET/CT findings. We plan to obtain DW -MRI scans on current patients, for 
whom we may not have a baseline DW -MRI scan, at the same timepoints, as applicable.  
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_765550] in reflects the difference in rate of diffusion between tissues. All attempts 
will be made to perform the DW -MRI scans on the same day as PET/CTs but this not mandatory. 
For DW -MRI, no external contrast will be used and fasting is not required. Standard clinical 
operating procedures will be used for image collection. DW -MRI evaluations will be considered 
purely explo ratory.

6.3.2 Disease Parameters  
• Measurable is defined as any of the following:  serum M -protein is ≥ 1 g/dL or 
"measurable" urine M -spi[INVESTIGATOR_179409] ≥ 200 mg/24 hours or serum kappa or lambda FREE light 
chain of 10 mg/dL along with an abnormal kappa to lambda free light chain ratio.  
• The serum free light chain (FLC) assay is of particular use in monitoring response to 
therapy in patients who have oligo -secretory disease. When using this a ssay, it is 
important to note that the FLC levels vary considerably with changes in renal function 
and do not solely represent monoclonal elevations. Thus both the level of the involved 
and the uninvolved FLC isotype (i.e., the involved/uninvolved ratio or  involved -
uninvolved difference) should be considered in assessing response. The serum FLC assay 
should be used in assessing response only if the baseline serum and/or urine M proteins 
are not “measurable” by [CONTACT_97106] (serum M protein ≥ 1gm/dL and/or urine M 
Abbreviated Title:   CRd in Newly Diagnosed MM  
Version Date:  03/27/2020  
 
46 protein ≥ 200 mg/24), and the baseline level of the involved FLC is ≥ 10mg/dL and 
clonal (abnormal ratio). Patients included on the study on the basis of FLC alone (i.e., no 
measurable serum/urine) should be the only ones who are evaluated u sing FLC response 
criteria. The others should follow usual criteria and ignore FLC results.  
• In order to be classified as a hematologic response, confirmation of serum monoclonal 
protein, serum immunoglobulin free light chain (when primary determinant of re sponse) 
and urine monoclonal protein (when primary determinant of response) results must be 
made by [CONTACT_99964].  
• Caution must be exercised to avoid rating progression or relapse on the basis of variation 
of radiological t echnique alone. Compression fracture does not exclude continued 
response and may not indicate progression. When progression is based on skeletal disease 
alone, it should be discussed with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_239878].  
• Appearance of mon oclonal or oligoclonal bands that are different from original isotype 
may not be defined as “relapse from CR”. Oftentimes, such bands may indicate 
fluctuations in immunological parameters that are not reflective of MM disease. In these 
situations, immunofi xation and electrophoresis will be interpreted by [CONTACT_239953] “relapse” (30). 
6.3.3 Response Criteria  from International Myeloma Working Group Criteria (31) and addition 
of nCR category (6, 21): 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Evaluation of  Response Cr iteria  
• Stringent Complete Response (sCR)  
Complete Response as defined below plus:  
Normal FLC ratio and absence of clonal cells in bone marrow by [CONTACT_582127] (presence/ absence of clonal cells is based on the kappa/ lambda 
ratio.  
• Complete Response (CR)  
Negative immunofixation on the serum and urine and disappearance of any soft tissue 
plasmacytomas and ≤5% plasma cells in bone marrow  
• Near Complete Response (nCR)  
Defined as absence of myeloma protein on electrophoresis, independent of 
immunofixation status (6, 21) 
• Very Good Partial Response (VGPR)  
Serum and urine M -protein detectable by [CONTACT_332864] 
90% or greater reduction in serum M -protein plus urine M -protein level < 100mg per 24h .  
If the serum and urine M -protein are unmeasurable, a ≥9 0% decrease in the difference 
between involved and uninvolved FLC levels is required in place of the M -protein 
criteria . 
• Partial Response (PR)  
≥50% reduction of serum M-protein  and reduction in 24 -h urinary M -protein by ≥90% or 
to <200mg per 24h .  If the serum and urine M -protein are unmeasurable, a ≥50% 
decrease in the difference between involved and uninvolved FLC levels is required in 
place of the M -protein criteria  
• Stable Disease (SD)  
Not meeting criteria for CR, VGPR, PR or progressive disease.  A ll categories also 
require no known evidence of progressive or new bone lesions if radiographic studies

47 were performed. Radiographic studies are not required to satisfy t hese response 
requirements.  
• Progressive disease (PD)  
Requires any one or more of the following:  
Increase of ≥25% from lowest response value  in the following on 2 consecutive 
measurements :  
▪ Serum M -component and/or (the absolute increase must be ≥0.5g/dl ). The serum 
M-component increases of ≥1 gm/dl are sufficient to define relapse if starting M -
component is ≥5g/dl.  
▪ Urine M -component and/or (the absolute increase must be ≥200mg/24h  
▪ Only in patients without measurable serum and urine M -protein levels: th e 
difference between involved and uninvolved FLC levels. The absolute increase 
must be >10mg/dl.  
▪ Bone marrow plasma cell percentage: the absolute % must be ≥10%  
▪ Definite development of new bone lesions or soft tissue plasmacytomas or definite 
increase in  size of existing bone lesions or soft tissue plasmacytomas  
▪ Development of hypercalcemia  that can be attributed solely to the plasma cell 
proliferative disorder  
• Relapse from CR  
Any one or more of the following : 
▪ Reappearance of serum or urine M-protein by [CONTACT_306680] . 
(Appearance of monoclonal or oligoclonal bands that are different from original 
isotype may not be  defined as “relapse from CR”. Often times, such bands may 
indicate fluctuations in immunological parameters th at are  not reflective of MM 
disease. In these situations, immunofixation and electrophoresis will be interpreted 
by [CONTACT_582128] “relapse”. (32, 33)) 
▪ Development of ≥ 5% plasma cells in the bone m arrow

8.5.3 E-mail:  [EMAIL_1271]  Reporting Pregnancy to [COMPANY_010]  
If a subject or spouse or partner of a subject becomes pregnant while enrolled in this clinical trial 
or up to three months following administration of carfilzomib, [COMPANY_010] Drug Safety  must be 
notified within 24 hours of the Investigator, designee, or site p ersonnel learning of the pregnancy  
(See [COMPANY_010] Drug Safety and Pharmacovigilance Contact [CONTACT_85830]) .  If the subject is 
pregnant, carfilzomib must be withheld.   
Subjects, spouses, or partners will be followed through the outcome of the pregnancy.  The 
Investigator will be required to report the results to [COMPANY_010] Drug Safety . 
If the outcome of the pregnancy meets a criterion for immediate classification as an SAE —
spontaneous abortion (any congenital anomaly detected in an aborted fetus is to be docume nted), 
stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly —the Investigator should repeat the procedures 
for expedited reporting of SAEs as outlined above.  
8.5.[ADDRESS_765575]’s last dose of lenalidomide are considered 
expedited reportable events.  If the subject is on lenalidomide, it is to be discontinued 
immediately and the subject is to be ins tructed to return any unused portion of lenalidomide to 
the Investigator.  The pregnancy must be reported to Celgene Drug Safety within 24 hours of the 
Investigator’s knowledge of the pregnancy by [CONTACT_202158].  
The Investigator wi ll follow the pregnant female until completion of the pregnancy, and must 
notify Celgene Drug Safety of the outcome as specified below.  The Investigator will provide 
this information as a follow -up to the initial SAE.  
If the outcome of the pregnancy meets  the criteria for immediate classification as a SAE (i.e., 
spontaneous abortion [any congenital anomaly detected in an aborted fetus is to be documented], 
stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly), the Investigator should follow the procedures 
for Expedited Reporting of SAEs to Celgene (i.e., report the event to Celgene Drug Safety by 
[CONTACT_31950] 24 hours of the Investigator’s knowledge of the event).  
Any suspected fetal exposure to lenalidomide must be reported to Celgene within 24 hours of

Version Date:  03/27/2020  
 
53 being made aware of the event.  The pregnant female should be referred to an 
obstetrician/gynecologist experienced in reproductive toxicity for further evaluation and 
counseling.  
All neonatal deaths that occur within [ADDRESS_765576] to 
causality, as SAEs.  In addition, any infant death after 30 days that the Investigator suspects is 
related to the in utero  exposure to lenalidomide should also be reported.  
In the case of a live “normal” birth, Celgene Drug Safety should be advised as soon as the 
information is available  
8.6 REPORTING PREGNANCY TO CCR    
8.6.1 Maternal  exposure  
If a patient becomes pregnant during the course of the study, the study treatment should be 
discontinued immediately, and the pregnancy reported to the Sponsor  no later than 24 hours of 
when the Investigator becomes aware of it . The Investigator should notify the Sponsor no later 
than 24 hours of when the outcome of the Pregnancy becomes known,  
Pregnancy itself is not regarded as an SAE. However, congenital  abnormalities or birth defects 
and spontaneous miscarriages that meet serious criteria (section 8.1.2 ) should be reported as 
SAEs .  
The outcome of all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, ectopic 
pregnancy, normal birth, or congenital abnormality) should be followed up and documented.  
8.6.[ADDRESS_765577] dose of study therapy . 
Pregnancy of the patient’s partner is not considered to be an AE. However, the outcome of all 
pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, ectopic pregnancy, normal birth, or 
conge nital abnormality) occurring from the date of the first dose until  [ADDRESS_765578] and the ad verse event.  CCR  will notify FDA and all participating investigators (i.e., all 
investigators to whom the sponsor is providing drug under its INDs or under any investigator’s 
IND) in an IND safety report of potential serious risks from clinical trials or any other source, as 
soon as possible, in accordance to [ADDRESS_765579] annually in a summary format.  
8.8 SPONSOR PROTOCOL  NON-ADHERENCE REPORTING  
Protocol non-adherence  is defined as any noncomplian ce with the clinical trial protocol, GCP, or 
protocol -specific procedural requirements on the part of the participant, the Investigator, or the 
Abbreviated Title:   CRd in Newly Diagnosed MM  
Version Date:  03/27/2020  
 
54 study site staff inclusive of site personnel performing procedures or providing services in support 
of the clini cal trial.  
It is the responsibility of the study Staff to document any protocol non-adherence identified by 
[CONTACT_582129] -Adherence Log.  The protocol -
specific, cumulative non-adherence  log should be maintained  in the site essential documents file 
and submitted to OSRO via [EMAIL_11074]  on the first business day of each 
month over the duration of the study . In addition, any non-adherence to the protocol  should be 
documented in the participant’s source records and reported to the local IRB per their guidelines. 
OSRO required protocol non-adherence  reporting is consistent with E6(R2) GCP: Integrated 
Addendum to ICH E6(R1): 4.5 Compliance with Protocol; 5.18.3 (a), and 5.20 Noncompliance; 
and ICH E3 16.2.2 Protocol deviations.  
9 CLINICAL MONITORING  
As a sponsor for clinical trials, FDA regulations require the CCR to maintain a monitoring 
program. The CCR’s program allows for confi rmation of: study data, specifically data that could 
affect the interpretation of primary study endpoints; adherence to the protocol, regulations, and 
SOPs; and human subjects protection. This is done through independent v erification of study 
data with sou rce documentation focusing on:  
• Informed consent process  
• Eligibility confirmation  
• Drug administration and accountability  
• Adverse events monitoring  
• Response assessment.  
The monitoring program also extends to multi -site research when the CCR is the coordinati ng 
center.  
This trial will be monitored by [CONTACT_582130]. Monitors are 
qualified by [CONTACT_12293]. Personnel 
monitoring this study will not be affiliated in any way with the tri al conduct . 
10 STATISTICAL  CONSIDERATIONS    
10.1 STUDY DESIGN /PRIMARY ENDPOINTS  
This is a single arm phase II study designed to evaluate efficacy of combinational therapy of 
carfilzomib, dexamethasone, and lenalidomide in newly diagnosed untreated MM patients.  The 
primary objectives of this study are to determine if the combination o f carfilzomib, lenalidomide 
and dexamethasone has acceptable toxicity in patients with newly diagnosed MM.  
10.2 SAMPLE SIZE DETERMINATION  
The sample size on which the trial will be based will be that necessary to demonstrate if the rate 
of grade 3 or worse neu rologic toxicity is lower than 10%, or if it could be consistent with a rate 
which is greater than 10%, in which case it would be considered excessive.  
We will plan to enroll a total of [ADDRESS_765580] grade 3 or worse neurologic toxicity, 
Abbreviated Title:   CRd in Newly Diagnosed MM  
Version Date:  03/27/2020  
 
55 then the probability that the true rate of grade 3+ neurologic toxici ty is 5% is 7.3% while the 
probability that the true rate of grade 3+ neurologic toxicity is 15% is 82.5%. Thus, the 
appearance of 5 or more patients with grade 3+ neurologic toxicity in 45 patients will provide 
evidence that the true rate of toxicity is c onsistent with 15%, and will be considered excessive.  
10.3 STATISTICAL ANALYSES  
10.3.1  Analysis of the Primary Endpoints  
The 90% and 95% confidence intervals will be constructed around the observed fraction of 
patients with grade 3+ neurologic toxicity, and will be re ported along with the observed 
incidence. If 5/[ADDRESS_765581] grade 3+ neurologic toxicity, the exact two -sided 90% CI 
bound extends from 4.5% to 22.0%, thus confirming that this rate of toxicity is likely to exceed 
5%, and is consistent with as high  as 22%.  
As an early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_582093] 20 patients : if [ADDRESS_765582] 
grade 3+ neurologic toxicity in the first two completed cycles of treatment, no further patients 
will be enrolled . As soon as this can be determined, since the lower 80% one -sided confidence 
bound around 4/20 is 11.7%, which, being greater than 10%, would be considered demonstration 
of excessive toxicity. In fact, the lower 80% bounds range from 67% for observing 4 patients 
with grade 3+ neu rologic toxicity in the first 4 patients to 12% for observing 4 patients with 
grade 3+ neurologic toxicity in 20 patients.  
The rates of VGPR+CR and CR alone will also be estimated and reported. These rates are 
expected to be fairly high. Two -sided 95% conf idence interval bounds will be formed around 
each of these measures.  
In order to allow for a small number of inevaluable patients, the accrual ceiling will be set at 50.   
It is anticipated that 2 -3 patients per month may enroll on this trial; thus, 2 years  is anticipated as 
the accrual period for this study.  
10.3.2  Analysis of the Secondary Endpoints  
Secondary endpoints are to estimate overall response rates (ORR) according to International 
Myeloma Working Group criteria after 8 cycles (31), progression free survival (PFS) , duration of 
response and overall survival.  Progression free survival, d uration of response and overall 
survival will be estimated using the Kaplan -Meier  method  and reported along wi th 95% 
confidence intervals at appropriate time points.  
A number of correlative studies will be performed in order to assess carfilzomib in vitro 
biological activity and investigate minimal residual disease in MM.  Minimal residual disease 
will be further explored using multi -parametric flow cytometry  and PET -CT imaging.

[IP_ADDRESS]  Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC)  
An MTA was executed before any of the samples described in Section 5 were  shipped to Ola 
Landgren, MD, PhD at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center  (MSKCC  #[ZIP_CODE] ).  [CONTACT_582139] will use samples for analyses of the causation, diagnostics and prognostics, and natural 
history of multiple myeloma and its precursor conditions. Additionally, the samples may be used 
for analyses of related hematologic malignancies and their  precursors states (including chronic 
lymphocytic leukemia and monoclonal B -cell lymphocytosis (MBL); Waldenstrom's 
macroglobulinemia and IgM MGUS), as well as myeloproliferative neoplasms.  
[CONTACT_582140] is a former NIH staff member  and PI/AI on this study  whose ongoing role was 
originally intended to be covered by [CONTACT_582131].  In reviewing the samples sent to [CONTACT_582140], it has been determined that samples 
received by [CONTACT_582132] a manner that i t would not be possible for him to identify the 
subjects from which the samples were obtained.  [CONTACT_582140] also does not have any access to 
the code key to identify the subjects.  Therefore, with Amendment P, [CONTACT_582140]’s 
involvement on study has been updated to a Non -NIH Collaborator as he does not have access to 
patient identifiers.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Food and Drug Administration  (FDA ) 
An MTA will be executed to allow the samples described in Section 5 to be shipped to the Office 
of Biotechnology at the FDA as part of the collaborative effort. The MTA will be a global CCR 
MTA (#[ZIP_CODE] ) to include multiple protocols;  however, [CONTACT_582141] jian will be the responsible P I

[ADDRESS_765583] always incurable plasma cell neoplasm that comprises approximately 10%  
of all hematologic malignancies.  MGUS, SMM, and MM increase in incidence with age.   
According to SEER statistics, from 2003 -2007, the median age at death for myeloma is 75 years 
of age. (1) Incidence rates of myeloma is higher among Blacks compared to Caucasians, affecting 
14.3 black males per 100, 000 males and 10.0 black females per 100,000 females compared to 
6.7 white males per 100, 000 males and 4.1 white females per  100, 000 women. (1) Despi[INVESTIGATOR_6831], 
MM affects all genders and races. As such, we expect that the majority of patients enrolled in 
this trial will be ol der adults of either gender or race. MM patients enrolled on this study will 
consist of patients referred to and screened at the NIH Clinical Center. There will be no subject 
selection bias with regard to gender, ethnicity, or race. This protocol excludes lactating and 
pregnant women from receiving this investigational drug to avoid any possible risks to the fetus 
or newborn.     
12.2 PARTICIPATION OF CHILDREN  
Pediatric patients with SMM are extremely rare. Patients under the age of 18 are excluded  from 
this stu dy because inclusion of a rare younger patient will not provide adequate generalizable 
information to justify their inclusion in this study

research participation ( Section  12.4), all subjects ≥ age 18 will be offered the opportunity to fill  
in their wishes for research and care, and assign a substitute decision maker on the “NIH 
Advance Directive for Health Care and  Medical Research Participation” form so that another 
person can make decisions  about their medical care in the event that they become incapacitated 
or cognitively impaired during the course of the study. Note: The PI [INVESTIGATOR_148364]  (ACAT)  for evaluation  as needed for the following:  an 
independent assessment of whether an individual has the capacity to provide consent; assistance 
in identifying and assessing an appropriate surrogate when indicated; and/or an as sessment of the 
capacity to appoint a surrogate .  For those subjects that become incapac itated and do not have 
pre-determined substitute decision maker, the procedures described in MAS Policy 87 -4 4 and 
NIH HRPP SOP 14E for appointing a surrogate decision maker for adult subjects who are (a) 
decisionally impaired, and (b) who do not have a legal guardian or durable power of attorney, 
will be followed.  
12.4 RISKS/BENEFITS ANALYSIS  
Currently, MM is an incurable malignancy with frequent complications of skeletal fr actures, 
anemia, renal failure and hypercalcemia.   Combination use of novel agents, such as proteasome 
inhibitors, have significantly prolonged survival in this diseas e population.  However, toxicity 
from bortezomib has  impacted patients with frequent epis odes of debilitating neuropathy.  
Carfilzomib, a new -generation proteasome inhibitor, has been tested in phase [ADDRESS_765585] recent phase 1 trial in newly diagnosed MM patients has shown 100% PR or better in [ADDRESS_765586] as it relates to traditional 
IMWG response criteria.  
The procedures required to obtain samples /data  for experimental purposes (venipuncture, urine 
collection, PET/CT scan , DW -MRI and bone marrow biopsy) are of limited risk to the patient.  
Although patients will suffer some additional pain or discomfort from the PET/CT scans , DW -
MRI and annual bone marrow biopsies, clinical experience has shown that the medical risk is 
limited.     
Adults who become unable to consent are allowed to remain on study because the protocol offers 
a prospect of direct benefit. The ongoing risks and benefits of participation for adults who 
become unable to consent are no different than those described for less vulnerable patients.  
12.5 CONSENT PROCESS AND DOCUMENTATION  
Informed consent will be obtained from all patients on this trial. There will be no minors  enrolled 
< 18 years of age; therefore, assent is unnecessary. The informed consent co ntains  all elements 
required for consent. In addition, the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_582094]:   CRd in Newly Diagnosed MM  
Version Date:  03/27/2020  
 
58 member of the research team will discuss the protocol in detail with the  patient and will be 
available to answer all patient questions to allo w the patient to give  informed consent.  
12.5.1  Telephone Re-consent  
Telephone consent applies to instances of re -consent only . Telephone re -consent will be obtained 
and documented per OHSRP/IRBO and CCR policies and procedures.  
13 PHARMACEUTICAL  INFORMATION   
13.1 CARFIL ZOMIB  (IND  # 112587 ) 
13.1.1  Source

provided carfilzomib during the active recruitment  and trea tment of this study.   However,  
ongoing communication and sharing of information, including updated risks for carfilzomib, is 
through an agreement with [COMPANY_010].  
13.1.2  Toxicity  
A comprehensive listing of all toxicities (i.e., very common, common, etc.) are listed in the 
informed consent document.  The approved USPI [INVESTIGATOR_239882].  
Amendment P, new information from [COMPANY_010], Inc: As of Ju ly 2019, carfilzomib has been 
examined in approximately 11,[ADDRESS_765587] been 4 cases of 
Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy  (PML) possibly linked to Carfilzomib  
13.1.3  Formulation and Preparation  
Carfilzomib for Injection will be provided as a lyophilized powder which, when reconstituted, 
contains 2 mg/mL isotonic solution of carfilzomib Free Base in 10  mM sodium citrate buffer 
(pH 3.5) containing 10% (w/v) sulfobutylether --cyclodextrin (SBE --CD, Captisol®).  
Lyophilized Carfilzomib for Injection is stored in a refrigerator at 2°C –8°C. Water for injection 
is the only acceptable solution for reconstitution.  Aft er addition of the appropriate amount of 
water for i njection and vigorous mixing, the solution is administered as an IV infusion.   Vials are 
for single use . A volume of carfilzomib appropriate for a pa tient's dose will be added to 5% 
Dextrose  Injection  (D5W) in a sufficient amount to yield a volume to administer 100 mL (qs. 
100 mL) in a polyvinyl chloride or polyolefin container.  
For clinical use, Carfilzomib products will contain excess drug -containing fluid to compensate 
for product container and administ ration set priming volumes.  
Before dispensing Carfilzomib products from the Pharmacy, an administration set suitable for a 
portable pump (e.g., Gemstar set [ZIP_CODE] -28) will be attached, the administration set tubing will be 
primed with drug -containing fluid,  air will be purged from the tubing (but not the product 
container), and the administration set will be capped with a Luer locking cap.

(36°F - 46°F).  Remove the Blue flip -off lid on the vial and aseptically add 29 mL of 
Water for Injection, USP to the lyophilized drug.  Gently invert the vial multiple times 
and let stand to yield a clear solution containing 2 mg/mL carfilzomib.  After 
reconstitution as instructed, a maximum total of 30 mL deliverable volume containing 60 
mg of carfilzomib can be withdrawn from the vial.   
Inspection :  The reconstituted drug solution in the vial should be a clear liquid.  Inspect all v ials 
for the presence of any suspended particles, particulate matter, discoloration or hazy solution 
prior to administration.  
If the solution is not clear or particles exist in inspected vials, record the observation in the 
appropriate Drug Accountability  Log and notify [COMPANY_010]  immediately.   
• DO NOT USE THE DRUG.  
• Place the vial(s) into a plastic bag labeled as "Quarantined" with the date.  
• Store labeled quarantined drug in a temperature -monitored refrigerator and ensure they 
are physically segregated from the drug that is available for use.  
• [COMPANY_010]  will instruct the clinical site on how to proceed with quarantined vial(s).  
Calculation of Dose :  Each dose will consist of Carfilzomib for Injection administered on 
a mg/m2 basis, and should be based on the patien t's actual calculated body surface area 
(BSA).   
The BSA should be calculated based upon the institution's practice and method of calculation 
should remain consistent throughout a subject's participation in the trial.  
Subjects with a BSA > 2.2 m2 will recei ve a dose based upon a 2.2 m2 BSA.  
Dose adjustments do not need to be made for weight gains/losses of ≤ 20%.  
13.1.[ADDRESS_765591] :  Lyophilized Carfilzomib for Injection must be kept in the labeled 
Abbreviated Title:   CRd in Newly Diagnosed MM  
Version Date:  03/27/2020  
 
60 drug cartons and stored at 2°C - 8°C (36°F - 46°F) in a refrigerator.  
If procedures permit, the refrigerator should be continuously monitored and temperature records 
retained for review.  
The refrigerator should also be on a backup generator and alarmed for temperature deviations if 
available.  Lyophilized Carfilzomib for Injection exposed at any time to temperatures exceeding 
30°C / 86°F must be discarded  
Reconstituted Drug Product :  Once a drug vial is reconstituted and inspected, the clear solution 
can be stored in a refrigerator (reco mmended) controlled from 2°C - 8°C (36°F - 46°F) or at 
room temperature from 15°C - 30°C (59°F - 86°F) until use. Once reconstituted, Carfilzomib for 
Injection must be used on the day of reconstitution or else it must be destroyed. Prior to 
administration,  all reconstituted drug should be equilibrated to room temperature. DO NOT 
FREEZE LYOPHILIZED OR RECONSTITUTED DRUG.  
Diluted Drug Product :  After dilution with D5W for clinical use , Carfilzomib should be stored 
under refrigeration.  
13.1.5  Administration P rocedures  
Carfilzomib will be administered by [CONTACT_483843] 30-minute s through a peripheral 
or central venous access device via portable (ambulatory ) pump . Care should be taken in placing 
and maintaining the product container at a level physically higher than the pump to avoid 
advancing air into the administration set tubing.   
If the patient  has a dedicated line for carfilzomib administration, the line must be  flushed with a 
minimum of [ADDRESS_765592] on human cytochrome CYP3A4/5. Given that the clearance  of 
carfilzomib likely occurs ex trahepatically via the activity of epoxide hydrolase and  peptidase 
activities, the clinical relevance of these in vitro results is not clear. No clinically  significant drug 
interactions have been noted to date in patients receiving a variety of agents  meta bolized by 
[CONTACT_097]3A4. Moreover, no dose adjustments have been required for any  concomitant medication in 
patients receiving carfilzomib. However, caution should be  exercised in administration of 
concomitant medications which are substrates of human  CYP3A4.

13.2.2  Toxicity  
A comprehensive listing of all toxicities (i.e., very common, common, etc.) are listed in the 
informed consent document.  The approved USPI [INVESTIGATOR_239882].  See below information regarding most significant toxicities:  
Fetal Risk :  Do not use REVLIMID during pregnancy. Lenalidomide, a thalido mide analogue, 
caused limb abnormalities in a developmental monkey study. Thalidomide is a known human 
teratogen that causes severe life -threatening human birth defects.  If lenalidomide is used during 
Abbreviated Title:   CRd in Newly Diagnosed MM  
Version Date:  03/27/2020  
 
61 pregnancy, it may cause birth defects or death to a de velopi[INVESTIGATOR_106784]. In women of childbearing 
potential, obtain 2 negative pregnancy tests before starting REVLIMID® treatment. Women of 
childbearing potential must use 2 forms of contraception or continuously abstain from 
heterosexual sex during and for 4 weeks  after REVLIMID treatment . 
Hematologic Toxicity :  REVLIMID can cause significant neutropenia and thrombocytopenia.  
In the pooled MM studies Grade 3 and 4 hematologic toxicities were  more frequent in patients 
treated with the combination of REVLIMID and de xamethasone than in patients treated with 
dexamethasone alone . 
Deep Vein Thrombosis and Pulmonary Embolism :  Venous thromboembolic events 
(predominantly deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary  embolism) have occurred in patients 
with MM treated with  lenalidom ide combination therapy.  A significantly increased risk of DVT 
and PE  was observed in patients with MM who were treated with REVLIMID  and 
dexamethasone therapy in a clinical trial.  
Allergic Reactions :  Angioedema and serious dermatologic reactions includ ing Stevens -Johnson 
syndrome  (SJS) and toxic epi[INVESTIGATOR_194] (TEN) have been reported. These events  can be 
fatal. Patients with a prior history of Grade [ADDRESS_765593] be discontinued for  angioedema, Grade 4 rash, exfoliative 
or bullous rash, or if SJS or TEN is suspected  and should not be resumed following 
discontinuation for these reactions.  
Tumor Lysis Syndrome :  Fatal instances of tumor lysis syndrome have been reported during 
treatment with lenalidomide. The patients at risk of tumor lysis syndrome are those with high 
tumor burden prior to treatment. These patients should be monitored closel y and appropriate 
precautions taken.   
Most common adverse reactions ( ≥20%) :  Fatigue, neutropenia, constipation,  diarrhea, muscle 
cramp, anemia, pyrexia, peripheral edema, nausea, back pain,  upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092], 
dyspnea, dizziness, thrombocytopenia, tremor and  rash 
13.2.3  Formulation and Preparation  
Lenalidomide will be supplied as capsules for oral administration . Celgene Inc. will  provide

man.  
Digoxin :  When digoxin was co -administered with lenalidomide, the digoxin AUC was not 
signi ficantly  different; however, the digoxin Cmax was increased by 14%. Periodic monitoring  
of digoxin plasma levels, in accordance with clinical judgment and based on  standard clinical 
practice in patients receiving this medication, is recommended during  admi nistration of 
lenalidomide.  
Warfarin :  Co-administration of multiple doses of [ADDRESS_765596] on the pharmacokinetic s of total lenalidomide.   Expected changes in 
laboratory assessments of PT and INR were observed after  warfarin administration, but these 
changes were not affected by [CONTACT_582134].  
Concomitant Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_582096] :  Erythropoietic agents, or 
other agents that may increase the risk of thrombosis, such  as estrogen containing therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], 
should be used with caution in MM patients receiving l enalidomide with dexamethasone

67 15 APPENDICES  
15.1 APPENDIX A:  REQUIREMENTS FOR REMS®  
Risks of Fetal Exposure, Pregnancy Testing Guidelines and Acceptable Birth Control 
Methods  
Requirements for REMS®  
• Patients should be instructed never to give lenalidomide to another person.  
• Patients will be asked to take part in a mandatory confidential survey prior to initiation of 
lenalidomide.  To take the survey, they will be instructed to call the Celgene Customer 
Care Center at 1 -[PHONE_3212].  Male patients will be asked to tak e the survey monthly.  
Female patients will be asked to take survey periodically (monthly if females of 
childbearing potential and every 6 months if females of not childbearing potential).   
• Female patients should not donate blood during therapy and for at  least 28 days following 
discontinuation of lenalidomide.  
• Male patients should not donate blood, semen or sperm during therapy or for at least 28 
days following discontinuation of lenalidomide.   
• Only enough lenalidomide for one cycle of therapy may be pre scribed with each cycle of 
therapy . Monthly phone counseling is required per the REMS® program in order to 
prescribe a one -month supply of lenalidomide.   
• All patients will be required to sign the REVLIMID, Patient -Physician Agreement Form.  
• Males must pract ice complete abstinence or use a condom during sexual contact [CONTACT_239963], during dose interruptions and for at least 28 days following 
lenalidomide dis continuation, even if he has undergone a successful vasectomy.  See 
below for further details  
• Females of childbearing potential must agree to use two reliable forms of contraception 
simultaneously or to practice complete abstinence from heterosexual interc ourse during 
the following time periods related to this study: 1) for at least 28 days before starting 
lenalidomide; 2) throughout the entire duration of lenalidomide treatment; 3) during dose 
interruptions; and 4) for at least [ADDRESS_765604] be registered into the mandatory REMS ® program, and be willing and 
able to comply with the requiremen ts of REMS ®.

68 Criteria for females of childbearing potential (FCBP)  
This protocol defines a female of childbearing potential as a sexually mature female who: 1) has 
not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy or 2) has not been naturally 
postmeno pausal for at least 24 consecutive months (i.e., has had menses at any time in the 
preceding 24 consecutive months).  
The investigator must ensure that:  
• Females of childbearing potential comply with the conditions for pregnancy risk 
minimization, including confirmation that she has an adequate level of understanding  
• Females NOT of childbearing potential acknowledge that she understands the hazards and 
necessary precautions associated with the use of lenalidomide  
• Male patients taking lenalidomide acknowledge that he understands that traces of 
lenalidomide have been found in semen, that he understands the potential teratogenic risk 
if engaged in sexual activity with a female of childbearing potential, and that he 
understands the need for the use of a condom eve n if he has had a vasectomy, if engaged 
in sexual activity with a female of childbearing potential.   
Contraception  
Females of childbearing potential (FCBP) enrolled in this protocol must agree to use two reliable 
forms of contraception simultaneously or to practice complete abstinence from heterosexual 
intercourse during the following time periods related to this study : 1) for at least 28 days before 
starting lenalidomide; 2) throughout the entire duration of lenalidomide treatment; 3) during dose 
interruptions; and 4) for at least [ADDRESS_765605] include one highly effective method and one 
additional effective (barrier) method. FCBP must be referred to a qualified provider of 
contraceptive methods if needed. The following are examples of highly effective and additional 
effective methods of contr aception:   
• Highly effective methods:  
▪ Intrauterine device (IUD)  
▪ Hormonal (birth control pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], injections, implants)  
▪ Tubal ligation  
▪ Partner’s vasectomy  
• Additional effective methods:  
▪ Male condom  
▪ Diaphragm  
▪ Cervical Cap  
Because of the increased risk of venous thromboembolism in patients with multiple myeloma 
taking lenalidomide and dexamethasone, combined oral contraceptive pi[INVESTIGATOR_117119]. 
If a patient is currently using combined oral contraception the patient should switch to one of the 
effec tive method listed above. The risk of venous thromboembolism continues for 4−6  weeks after 
discontinuing combined oral contraception. The efficacy of contraceptive steroids may be reduced 
during co -treatment with dexamethasone.  
Implants and levonorgestrel -releasing intrauterine systems are associated with an increased risk of 
infection at the time of insertion and irregular vaginal bleeding. Prophylactic antibiotics should be

69 considered particularly in patients with neutropenia.  
Pregnancy testing  
Medically  supervised pregnancy tests with a minimum sensitivity of 50  mIU/mL must be 
performed for females of childbearing potential, including females of childbearing potential who 
commit to complete abstinence, as outlined below.  
Before starting lenalidomide  
Fema le Patients:  
FCBP must have two negative pregnancy tests (sensitivity of at least 50 mIU/mL) prior to 
prescribing lenalidomide.  The first pregnancy test must be performed within [ADDRESS_765606] be performed within 24 hours prior 
to prescribing lenalidomide.  The patient may not receive lenalidomide until the Investigator has 
verified that the results of these pregnancy tests are negative.  
Male Patients:  
Must agree to practice complete abstinen ce or agree to use a condom during sexual contact [CONTACT_239963], during dose interruptions and for at least 28 days following lenalidomide 
discontinuation , even if he has undergone a successful vasectomy.   
During study participation and for 28 days following lenalidomide discontinuation  
Female Patients:  
• FCBP with regular  or no menstrual cycles must agree to have pregnancy tests weekly for 
the first [ADDRESS_765607] 28 days of lenalidomide treatment, including dose interruptions, and then eve ry 
14 days throughout the remaining duration of lenalidomide treatment, including dose 
interruptions, at lenalidomide discontinuation, and at Day 14 and Day 28 following 
lenalidomide discontinuation.   
• At each visit, the Investigator must confirm with the FCBP that she is continuing to use 
two reliable methods of birth control at each visit during the time that birth control is 
required.   
• If pregnancy or a positive pregnancy test does occur in a study patient, lenalidomide must 
be immediately discontinued.  
• Pregnancy testing and counseling must be performed if a patient misses her period or if her 
pregnancy test or her menstrual bleeding is abnormal.  Lenalidomide treatment must be 
temporarily discontinued during this evaluation.  
• Females must agree to abstai n from breastfeeding during study participation and for at least 
28 days after lenalidomide discontinuation.  
Male Patients:  
• Must practice complete abstinence or use a condom during sexual contact [CONTACT_582135] t hroughout the entire duration of lenalidomide

Therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) is the only procedure known to directly  an d rapi[INVESTIGATOR_615372],  suggesting  that TPE may  improve  patient outcomes  in critically  ill 
patients  with COVID -[ADDRESS_816011] of therapeutic plasm a exchange 
(TPE) on hyperviscosity and patient outcomes in COVID -[ADDRESS_816012] been treated with TPE  in the Emory Healthcare system (EHC), 
with several patients appearing to benefit from this procedure.  However, a more formal 
and deliberate approach to  determining whe ther TPE reduces viscosity and results in 
beneficial outcomes in these patients  is needed . We hypothesize that TPE  will normalize 
plasma viscosity  while also reducing the level of key factors such as fibrinogen and

proinflammatory cytokines  (tumor necrosis factor [TNF], IL -6, and IL -1β) that likely driv e 
inflammation and thrombophilia, which leads  to clot formation , in these patients. In 
doing so, we hypothesize  that TPE will lead to improved clinical outcomes in critically ill 
COVID -[ADDRESS_816013] of care ( SOC).

3. Background  
 
The COVID -19 pandemic caused by [CONTACT_7547] -CoV-2 virus can cause  a spectrum of 
disease ranging from asymptomatic /mild pneumonia  in 80%  of patients, t o critical 
illness (respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399], septic shock  and/or multiple organ dysfunction/failure ) in 5 % 
of patients3. However, it has been a challenge to decipher the cause of severe COVID -
19-related complications and therefore define optimal approaches to treat critically ill 
patients with COVID -19, particularly those with signs of severe organ injury that often 
develop multi- organ failure.  
 In a preliminary study analyzing various laboratory markers in COVID -19 patients that 
may contribute to inadequate blood flow and therefore compromised organ function, 
we observed elevated plasma viscosity measurements ranging from 1.9 -4.2 centipoise 
(cp, normal range is 1.4 -1.8 cp) in [ADDRESS_816014] that 
altered blood flow secondary to hyperviscosity may directly alter blood flow, 
contributing to end organ injury and possibly death.  In these cases of severe COVID -19, 
hypervis cosity was strongly correlated with higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment 
(SOFA) scores, a measure of mortality risk and level of organ dysfunction in ICU patients (Pearson r = 0.841, R2 = 0.7072, p<0.001)
4. 
 In addition to directly impacting end organ injury secondary to altered blood flow, we hypothesize that increased viscosity due to hy perfibrinogenemia contributes to 
increased thrombotic complications in these patients. Notably, a ll four of the initial 
patients evaluated with plasma viscosity >3.5 cp had a known acute thrombotic  
complication. Hyperviscosity is a risk factor for thrombos is

Page 6 of 19  Protocol Version: 1.0 – June 23, 2020  
and endothelial damage. Alternatively, hyperviscosity may serve as a biomarker 
reflecting the patient’s hypercoagulable state.  Multiple studies have suggested  a high 
rate of thromboembolic complications ( DVT, PE, limb ischemia, clotting of venous 
catheters ) in critically ill COVID -19 patients6, even in the setting of VTE prophylax is7–12. 
Anticoagulation  treatment has been shown to decrease mortality in critically ill COVID -
[ADDRESS_816015] developed VTE prophylaxis 
and treatment guidelines for  use in patients with COVID -19. Many of the critically ill 
COVID -19 patients meet ISTH criteria for disseminated intravascular coagulation ( DIC)14, 
but the exact nature and mechanism driving this COVID -[ADDRESS_816016] undergone TPE  using frozen 
plasma (FP)  as the replacement fluid. Refractory hypercoagulability in these patients 
was defined as arterial/venous thrombosis or worsening/refractory organ failure 
suspected to be due to microthrombi  while on therapeutic anticoagulation.  The initial 4 
patients from EUHM had plasma viscosity >3.5 cp  and SOFA scores >14 , while 2 patients 
from ESJH  and 1 patie nt from EUH had values <3.5 cp  and SOFA scores <[ADDRESS_816017] treated, were ini tiated on TPE  as salvage therapy. 
They had very high  SOFA scores (19, and 15)  pre-treatment  and despi[INVESTIGATOR_615373], 
these patients unfortunately  succumbed to COVID -19. Of note, mortality in patients 
with SOFA scores over 11 has been reported to be over 80%16. 
 Although only limited conclusions can be drawn from this small sample size, our initial 
experience has suggested that early intervention with TPE  prior to significant and 
perhaps irreversible end -organ injury  may  not onl y reduce plasma viscosity, but also 
improve clinical outcomes in COVID -19 patients.  We therefore hypothesize tha t early 
normalization of plasma viscosity through TPE with FP replacement will improve clinical 
outcome s in critically ill COVID -19 patients  with hyperviscosity by [CONTACT_615383] .

clinical data including physician records, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], clinical records, and laboratory results . At any point during study period, if plasma viscosity > 3.[ADDRESS_816020] clinical judgment of ICU  
team, participants will be considered as treatment failure and offered TPE as part of their SOC . 
Patients in whom this happens will still be followed for outcome measurements.   7. Data and Specimen Banking   
 Discarded clinical specimens collected as part of routine clinical care of participants during study period, along with discarded apheresed patient plasma , will be collected 
and stored in PI’s lab oratory  for future research studies. These include discarded  clinical 
specimens prior to and after each TPE  treatment, but no additional specimens will be 
collected for non -clinical research purposes only.  Data will be deidentified and coded to 
remove identifying information. An electronic  key linking the patient i dentifiers  with the 
sample ID will be maintained on access -restricted Emory server and  restricted to the 
study PI [INVESTIGATOR_6254] -investigators.  
 8. Sharing of Results with Participants  
 Clinical data will be entered into patient medical records, and  study participants will be 
able to request  them through the  medical records office at their respective hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  
Study results will be made available as publication.  
 9. Study Timelines  
 
• The duration of an individual participant’s participation in the study  is for the 
duration of their hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11298] . 
• The duration anticipated to enroll all study participants : 
Estimated completion in 6 months  from start of study date ( Nove mber 2020) , but 
depends on the number  of COVID -19 patient admissions , which remains  
uncertain.  The timeline may be extended through winter 2021 as needed.  
• The estimated date for the investigators to complete this study (complete 
primary analyses) :  
12 months  from completion of study date ( November 2021) , but timeline may be 
extended as needed depending on study completion date.

attached HRP -417 form.  
 12. Local Number of Participants  
 
We plan to enroll a total of 20 patients. Based on experience, we estimate that 50% of 
critical care admission s at EUH, EUHM, ESJH  with COVID -[ADDRESS_816023] care for COVID -19 patients admitted to 
the EHC ICUs will screen patients for eligibility  based on clinical and laboratory

Page 11 of 19  Protocol Version: 1.0 – June 23, 2020  
information obtained as part of routine SOC. Investigators  will be notified of eligible 
patients, and will consent patient or appropriate medical decision maker for enrollment 
in study. Study participants will not be given any form of payment or reimbursed for 
expenses/travel.  
 14. Withdrawal of Participants  
 Participant  or appropriat e medical decision maker may provide written notice to 
formally withdraw from study.  In the event of formal withdrawal from study, any 
specimen collected and stored as part of study will be discarded. However, other clinical specimen may still be collected as part of providing routine SOC.  The intervention arm 
of this s tudy involves [ADDRESS_816024] 1 session of TPE but consents to continued 
data collection, they will remain in the intervention arm of this study.  
 15. Risks to Participants  
 All participants in this study are critically ill with COVID -19 and requir e ICU admission. 
Such patients experience frequent complications and events that can cause deterioration in function of any and all vital organs.  Specific risks associated with this 
research protocol are limited to possible complications related to apheresis/transfusion 
procedure that the TPE group will receive, as opposed to the SOC group.  The following 
are known complications associated with all apheresis/transfusions regardless of 
indication : 
  
• Hypotension  
• Hypocalcemia  
• Citrate Toxicity  
• ACE Inhibitor Reactions  
• Transfusion -associated circulatory overload (TACO)  
• Transfusion -related acute lung injury (TRALI)  
• Transfusion -associated dyspnea (TAD)  
• Allergic reaction (where severity can range from mild to life threatening and rarely death)  
• Hypotensive transfusion reaction  
• Febrile non -hemolytic transfusion reaction (FNHTR)  
• Acute hemolytic transfusion reaction (AHTR)  
• Delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction (DHTR)  
• Transfusion -transmitted infection (TTI)  
 While we do not anticipate that the relative risks will fundamentally differ, these risks are actively disclosed to patients as part of the routine consent process. Minor/mild 
Protocol Title : Therapeutic plasma exchange for COVID -19-associated hyperviscosity  
Page 12 of 19  Protocol Version: 1.0 – June 23, 2020  
reactions (hypotension, hypocalcemia, allergic) are not uncommon, whereas others 
occur in <1% of procedures (citrate toxi city), or are extremely rare (hemolytic 
transfusion reactions).  TPE is performed by [CONTACT_615390]- versed in 
recognizing these known complications and follow ing protocols that include mitigation 
strategies for potential side effects.  
 No potential risks are foreseen to be associated with any of the testing, as it will be 
conducted on sample s from the unit collected  as part of routine care .  
 16. Potential Benefits to Participants  
 Study participants may directly benefit from preventing /mitigating  thromboembolic 
complications, and improvement in clinical outcome (organ function, enhanced 
probability of survival, shortened time to recovery ). 
 17. Data Management and Confidentiality  
 
Data Analysis  
Sample size and power considerations:  The primary efficacy outcome for the two parallel 
group clinical trial is plasma viscosity.  Sample size and power considerations for the primary 
outcome, plasma viscosity, were based on longitudinal data (before and after PLEX treatment) from 7 patients (mean = 3.4 and 1.6 centipoise before and after PLEX treatment; standard 
deviation = 0.69 and 0.15 centipoise before and after PLEX treatment).  The primary goal of the 
trial is to compare the change across time in the PLEX arm to the change across time in the 
standard of care arm.  Group sample sizes of [ADDRESS_816025] 
of care arm achieve 93% power to detect a difference in mean change between treatment groups of 1.0 centipoise in a design with pre/post measurements.  These power calculations for 
plasma viscosity change assume a 1.5 centipoise improvement (decline) on average between baseline and after PLEX treatment and 0.[ADDRESS_816026] of 0.60.  The significance level (alpha) is 0.[ADDRESS_816027] deviation of the differences is as high as 
0.75, the power will be 80%.  All plasma viscosity power calculations were done with PASS 15 
Power Analysis and Sample Size Software (2017). NCSS, LLC. Kaysville, Utah, [LOCATION_003], ncss.com/software/pass.  
 Statistical Analysis Plan : The primary analyses of the data will be performed according to 
subjects’ original treatment assignment (i.e., intention -to- treat analyses) regardless of 
complianc e to treatment and the inclusion of all data from all subjects randomized in the final 
analysis. The primary endpoint in this intent -to-treat, parallel -group trial will be mean plasma 
viscosity.  A repeated -measures analysis of plasma viscosity will be performed with a means 
model via the SAS MIXED Procedure (version 9.4; SAS Institute, Cary, NC), providing separate 
Protocol Title : Therapeutic plasma exchange for COVID -19-associated hyperviscosity  
Page 13 of 19  Protocol Version: 1.0 – June 23, 2020  
estimates of mean plasma viscosity by [CONTACT_349295] (before and after treatment) an d 
treatment group.  
 
The model will include three predictors [treatment arm, time on study (categorical) and the statistical interaction between treatment arm and time on study]. A compound -symmetric 
variance -covariance form in repeated measurements will be assumed for plasma viscosity and 
robust estimates of the standard errors of parameters will be used to perform statistical tests construct 95% confidence intervals
17. The model -based means are unbiased with unbalanced 
and missing data, as long as the missing data are non -informative (missing at random, MAR). A 
P-value ≤0.05 will be considered statistically significant for the main effects  (treatment and time 
on study) and for the treatment by [CONTACT_615391] -
measures analysis.  The statistical test for interaction between time on study and treatment 
will be the overall hypothesis test to determine whether plasma viscosity in the two study 
groups changed in significantly different ways during follow -up (i.e., different temporal 
patterns over time).  If mean plasma viscosity in the two treatment groups is consistently 
different or similar over time (i.e., no s tatistical interaction) then the main effect test for 
treatment will be used as the primary hypothesis test to compare the 2 treatment groups.  The 
primary study results from this model will be the mean plasma viscosity and 95% confidence interval for the P LEX group, the mean plasma viscosity and 95% confidence interval for the 
standard of care group and the mean difference and 95% confidence interval.  If a significant 
interaction is detected, then t- tests will be used to compare the differences between the 
model -based treatment means at each time point and to compare differences over time within 
each treatment arm.  Specific statistical tests will be done within the framework of the mixed 
effects linear model. All statistical tests will be 2 -sided and unadjus ted for multiple 
comparisons.  Secondary outcomes for additional laboratory parameters  (fibrinogen, d- dimer, 
CRP, IL -6, and immunoglobulin levels ) will be analyzed using the same plan described for 
plasma viscosity.  
 This trial will provide important estima tes of variability (within- subject and between- subject 
standard deviation) for plasma viscosity. The estimates of variability will be valuable to power future clinical trials since these variability estimates are essential components for sample size calcul ations.  Due to the small sample sizes, results from these studies will also focus on the 
magnitude of the differences for each outcome, consistency of findings and clinical significance.

 Study Ability to Detect Uncommon Safety Events  
Adverse Events (AE) means any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of an intervention in humans, whether or not considered interv ention- related (21 CFR 312.32 (a)). An 
adverse event (AE) or suspected adverse reaction is considered "serious" if, in the view of either the investigator or sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: death, a life -threatening 
Protocol Title : Therapeutic plasma exchange for COVID -19-associated hyperviscosity  
Page 14 of 19  Protocol Version: 1.0 – June 23, [ADDRESS_816028] normal life functions, 
or a congenital anomaly/birth defect. The following guidelines will be used to describe severity.  
 
• Mild – Events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the 
participant’s daily activities.  
• Moderate – Events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the 
therapeutic measures. Moderate events may cause some interference with functioning.  
• Severe – Events interrupt a participant’s usual daily activity and may require systemic 
drug therapy or other treatment. Severe events are usually potentially life -threatening 
or incapacitating.  Of note, the term “ severe” does not necessarily equate to “serious”.]  
 All adverse events (AEs) must have their relationship to study intervention assessed by [CONTACT_61186]/her clinical judgmen t. The degree of certainty about causality will be graded using the 
categories below.   
• Related  – The AE is known to occur with the study intervention, there is a reasonable 
possibility that the study intervention caused the AE, or there is a temporal relationship between the study intervention and event. Reasonable possibility means that there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the study intervention and the AE.  
• Not Related  – There is not a reasonable possibility that the administration o f the study 
intervention caused the event, there is no temporal relationship between the study intervention and event onset, or an alternate etiology has been established.  
 
All participants in this study are critically ill with COVID -19 and require ICU admission. Such 
patients experience frequent complications and events that can cause deterioration in 
function of any and all vital organs. Any medical condition that is present at the time that the 
participant is screened will be considered as baseline and not reported as an AE. However, if 
the study participant’s condition appears to deteriorate in response to the  procedure  it will 
be recorded as an AE.  
 The table below addres ses safety using adverse event probabilities based on the targeted 
enrollment of 10 patients in each treatment group. The table provides the binomial probabilities of observing 0, 1+, or 2 or more occurrences of an AE during follow -up. 
 
Adverse Event Probabilities for n=10 PLEX patients or n=[ADDRESS_816029] of care patients  
 
Event Rate (AE)  
 Probability  
[0 / 10 Events]  Probability  
[1+ / 10 Events]  Probability  
[2+ / 10 Events]  
5% 0.60  0.40  0.09  
10%  0.35  0.65  0.26  
15%  0.20  0.80  0.46

Thus, we can be 80% sure of observing at least one epi[INVESTIGATOR_44715] a rare AE if the true rate of 
an AE is 15%.  
 
Adverse Events and Laboratory Toxicities : Each adverse event and each laboratory toxicity 
will be counted only once per participant as the most severe level reported during follow -
up. Tabular summaries of the number of participants reporting each AE, for both treatment -related and unrelated AEs as well as just treatment related AEs, respectively will 
be reported. Adverse events and grade III or higher  laboratory toxicities observed during 
follow -up will be reported by [CONTACT_1570].  
 
Data Storage  
1. All data will be kept on encrypted and password -secure Emory University Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_615377], encrypted devices that are Emory IT vetted, or secure Emory servers, 
such as Trusted storage, with only the investigators listed having access to review the 
data.  
2. Data will be deidentified and coded to  remove iden tifying information.  An electronic key 
linking the patient identifiers with the sample ID will be maintained on access -restricted 
Emory server and restricted to the study PI [INVESTIGATOR_6254] -investigators.  
3. Unu sed data will be destroyed upon completion of the study.  
4. The Data will not be reused or disclosed to any other person or entity.  
 
18. Provisions to Monitor the Data to Ensure the Safety of Participants  
 
Participants will be closely monitored by [CONTACT_615393] 24/7 basis for any change in clinical status, and any adverse events directly related to study intervention as defined above in Section 15: Risks to Participants  will be reported to PI ([CONTACT_615395] er) 
within [ADDRESS_816030] monthly and will include the protocol’s principal investigator, co-investigators, research coordinator and, when appropriate, the 
collaborators and researchers involved with the conduct of the protocol. During these 
meetings, the investigators will discuss matters related to: safety of protocol participants, validity and integrity of the data, characteristics of  participants, adherence 
to protocol (potential or real protocol violations), data completeness, and progress of data for study objectives.  The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_615378]. Data will be reviewed to assure the safety of the subjects as well as the validity of the data. The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_12762], review safety reports, and clinical trial endpoints and to confirm that the safety outcomes favor continuation of the study. The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_615379].

Meeting reporting requirements: All adverse events will be collected on e ach 
participant. We will report adverse events to the IRB as required by [CONTACT_1744] P&P and as part of regular progress reports.  
 All AEs including local and systemic reactions not meeting the criteria for SAEs will be captured on the appropriate case report form (CRF). Information to be collected includes event description, time of onset, clinician’s assessment of severity, relationship to study product 
(assessed only by [CONTACT_8703] a diagnosis), and time of 
resolution /stabilization of the event. All AEs occurring while on study must be documented 
appropriately regardless of relationship. All AEs will be followed to adequate resolution.  
 Changes in the severity of an AE will be documented to allow an assessment of the duration of the event at each level of severity to be performed. AEs characterized as intermittent require documentation of onset and duration of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865].  
  19. Provisions to Protect the Privacy Interests of Participants  
 
• The research team will take steps to make the participant s feel at ease with the 
research situation in terms of the questions being asked and the procedures being performed.  
• The participants  will be reassured that no private data will be shared with 
anyone outside the study and that they have the right to withdraw without fear of penalty at any  time prior to, during, or after enrollment . 
• The participant s will be given an opportunity to as any questions or address any 
concerns they may have at the time of recruitment or anytime thereafter.  
• The research team  is permitted to access clinical information from the 
participant’s electronic medical record for data analysis.  
 
20. Economic Burden to Participants  
 
There are no costs that participants will be responsible for because of participation in 
the research.  
 
21. Consent Process  
 Consent for study enrollment will be carried out by [CONTACT_389930] -investigators that are part 
of the clinical care  team. The consent discussion should take approximately ten minutes; 
however, the discussion will continue as long as is necessary to answer all of the patient’s questions. We will minimize coercion or undue influence by [CONTACT_615394]. In order to ensure that the patient understands the process, we will provide time for follow up questions.  Consent will be obtained in English, but an 
Protocol Title : Therapeutic plasma exchange for COVID -19-associated hyperviscosity  
Page 17 of 19  Protocol Version: 1.0 – June 23, 2020  
appropriate medical interpreter  will be used if the prospective participants  do not 
understand and/or speak English.  
 
Critically ill patients  may be  unable to consent due to severity of their illness.  If subject is 
unable to consent, the legally authorized representative (LAR) in the  following  order  of 
priority as outlined in Emory IRB P&P will be sought for consent: 
1. Durable power of attorney for health care  
2. Court appointed guardian for health care decisions  
3. Spouse  
4. Any Adult offspring for his/her Parents  
5. Any Parent for his/her Adult offspring  
6. Any Adult for his/her brother or sister  
7. Any grandparent for his/her grandchild  
8. Any Adult grandchild for his or her grandparent  
9. Any Adult niece, nephew, aunt, or uncle of the patient who is related to the patient in the first degree  
In the event that the patient or LAR cannot provide a wet signature [INVESTIGATOR_217524], the LAR will be able to remotely sign and send the consent via encrypted email.  
 22. Setting  
 
• The research team will work with clinicians providing direct care to  COVID19 
patients admitted to the ICU at EUH, EUHM, ESJH to identify and recruit potential 
study participants.  
• TPE will be performed on site where patient is admitted.  
• Laboratory specimen collected as part of routine SOC will be processed in 
accordance to individual hospi[INVESTIGATOR_615380].  
• Laboratory specimen collected as part of research study will be processed and 
stored at  the PI’s laboratory.  
 
23. Resources Available 
 
• EUH, EUHM, and ESJH are all part of Emory Healthcare, which is the largest 
healthcare system in the state of Georgia. EUH is a large tertiary academic hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. The study will be a collaborative effort among different laboratories within the three hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] s. 
• The ICU census of COVID19 patients at EUH, EUHM, and ESJH has been as high as 
~80 patients  per day  (April 2020). Given the continued pandemic, we anticipate 
that there will be sufficient volume of COVID19 patients requiring ICU  admissions 
for study enrollment over the recruitment period . 
• The study participants will have access to medical and psychological resources 
offered as part of their clinical care as a patient of the Emory  Healthcare system. 
Protocol Title : Therapeutic plasma exchange for COVID -19-associated hyperviscosity  
Page 18 of 19  Protocol Version: 1.0 – June 23, [ADDRESS_816031] care will be available to thoroughly 
address any questions or concerns regarding participation in this study.  
• The research team’s time will be spent recruiting study participants , performing  
chart review, and analyzing data. Other persons at Emory involved in the study will spend their time performing the various assays included in the study (detailed above).  
• All co -investigators and all other persons assisting with the project will be 
adequa tely informed about the protocol, the research procedures, and their duties 
and functions prior to recruitment of the first study participant. Additionally, 
periodic reviews will be held every quarter to ensure all protocols and procedures are being followed.

- 14 - 2.0 INTRODUCTION   
2.1 Background  
Psoriasis is a common, immune -mediated, inflammatory  skin disease that is found world -wide. 
The prevalence of diagnosed psoriasis in the US is approximately 3%1 whereas the prevalence in 
Europe varies anywhere from 0. 6 to 6.5%2 with an average of approximately 3%3. The clinical 
course is unpredictable but in most  cases, psoriasis is a chronically remitting and relapsing disease. 
Chronic stable plaque psoriasis (psoriasis vulgaris) is the m ost common form of the disease, 
accounting for 85 -90 % of cases4. Plaque -type psoriasis or psoriasis vulgaris is the most common 
form of the disease, and manifests as raised, red, scaly patches with silver scales. The  lesions are 
usually distributed symmetrically, and occur most commonly on the extensor parts of elbows and 
knees; scalp, lumbosacral region and umbilicus5. Patients with psori asis have reduced quality of 
life with reduced levels of employment and income6, and studies have shown  that patients with 
psoriasis  are emotionally and physically impaired by [CONTACT_725525], heart disease, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes or depression7;8. 
Individuals with psoriasis appear to be at an elevated risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_725500], such as metabolic syndrome/type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, psoriatric 
arthritis and other chronic inflammatory diseas es9;10 
There is no cure for psoriasis. The goal of treatment is to reduce or eliminate its signs and 
symptoms. Mild to moderate disease is often treated with topi[INVESTIGATOR_12491]. Among topi[INVESTIGATOR_81967], a combination treatment of a Vitamin D analog and a topi[INVESTIGATOR_725501]. Several studies show that the combination of Calcipotriene ( CAL ) and 
betamethasone ( BDP ) is superior to each of the single agent11-12.There is strong scientific rationale 
for the combination of vitamin D and glucocorticosteroids both with respect to efficacy and 
safety13-15, and combination treatment with a Vitamin D analog and a topi[INVESTIGATOR_725502]16-19 
CAL  and BDP  are incompatible  in an aqueous  environment, since CAL  requires basic conditions 
to maintain stability while betamethasone requires acidic conditions. Currently  marketed products 
are therefore restricted to non -aqueous, oil-based formulations.  
The s ponsor has developed the MC2 -01 cream containing the fixed dose combination 0.005 w/w% 
CAL (as anhydrate) and 0.064 w/w% BDP using the proprietary PADTM Technology which 
protects the drug su bstances from degradation during storage. The MC2 -01 cream is easy to apply, 
and the cosmetic appearance is that of a white, easily -spreadable cream that absorbs completely 
into the skin a few minutes after application . It is expected that MC2 -01 cream wil l differentiate 
from marketed formulations of CAL/BDP by [CONTACT_725526] . 
MC2 Therapeutics  Clinical Trial Protocol  Protocol MC2 -01-C3 
20 December  2017  
 
- 15 - 2.2 Rationale of the Trial  
To increase the likelihood that adequate quantifiable systemic concentrations of CAL and BDP 
and their main metabolites  under maximal use cond itions to determine the pharmacokinetic 
parameters in sufficient numbers of patients, Taclonex® Ointment  has been selected as the 
comparator. MC2 -01 cream will be compared to Taclonex® Ointment  following once daily 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_725503], trunk,  and limbs. Dosages will be up to 100 g per week for 8 weeks for MC2 -01 cream and 
for 4  weeks for Taclonex® Ointment .  
 
At Week 4, blood samples will be taken a t selected intervals after topi[INVESTIGATOR_725504] . Upper limits will be calculated for the PK parameters,  area under the concentration -
time curve (AUC)  from time zero to the planned last PK blood sampling time point of 7 hours 
(AUC 0-7) and maximum plasma drug concentration (C max). To the extent the data allow  to 
calculate the PK parameters , the following parameters will be calculated : AUC from time zero to 
the last quantifiable  concentration  (AUC 0-t), AUC from time zero to infinity  (AUC 0-∞), time to 
maximum plasma d rug concentration (T max), and  elimination half -life ( T½).  
 
Taclonex® Ointment  is only approved for daily application for up to [ADDRESS_990363] trial only subjects with upper level of disease involvement  will be 
included. Inclusion criteria will be subjects  with extensive psoriasis covering between 20-30% of 
the BSA  on trunk, limbs and/or scalp . The intent of  the inclusion criteria is b oth to take into 
account the potential risk that patients may decide to apply MC2 -01 cream  on the scalp and also 
to take into account precedent from previous approved CAL/BPD products.  
 
According to input from experienced investigators, subjects with exten sive vulgaris psoriasis 
may have psoriasis elements of guttatae character. Considering that the histological 
characteristics of guttate psoria sis and the clinical response to Vitamin D and glucocorticoids are 
similar to what is observed in subject with pso riasis vulgaris, presence  of psoriasis elements of 
guttate character will not be an exclusion  criterium in this study.  
  
MC2 Therapeutics  Clinical Trial Protocol  Protocol MC2 -01-C3 
20 December  2017  
 
- 16 - To evaluate the safety of the MC2 -01 cream , all adverse events (AEs) , reported by [CONTACT_725527] , are recorded. In addition, any effects resulting from systemic 
absorption of the active components, BDP  and CAL , are evaluated by [CONTACT_725528], respectively.  Adrenal function can therefore be measured by [CONTACT_725529] a syntheti c subunit of ACTH into the subject, and then measuring the production of cortisol by 
[CONTACT_714919]. In the present study , enrolled subjects in the MC2 -[ADDRESS_990364] before and after  4 and 8 weeks’  
treatment.   
Overdosage  with topi[INVESTIGATOR_725505]20 due to the systemic absorption of  CAL , 
which then affects calcium metabolism as it is a vitamin D analogue. However, extensive 
experience with topi[INVESTIGATOR_725506] , when used in the recommended amounts (maximum weekly dose in adults 
of 100 g of a 50 mcg/g concentration). Doses up to [ADDRESS_990365] been used with serum calcium 
remaining within the reference range21. Calcium metabolism will be  evaluated in the present 
study by [CONTACT_725530], phosphate, alkaline phosphat ase and 
plasma PTH before, during and after treatment. A 24 -hour urine sample will be collected and the 
urinary calcium  phosphate, sodium and creatinine will be measured and the urinary 
calcium:creatinine  and phosphate:creatinine  ratios will be calculated . It is well -established that 
there is a relationship between dietary calcium intake and the urinary calcium excretion in 
adults22. The urinary excretion of calcium has been reported to increase by 6 -19 mg with each 
additional 100 mg of calcium intake22;23. Subjects will not be asked to change their diet during 
the study, but in order to limit diet -related variability in urinary calcium excretion , their normal 
consumption of calcium -rich foods will be  reviewed and should be kept constant during [ADDRESS_990366] pe ople,  this protocol  focusse s on the intake of 
dairy products. The subjects will keep a diary of the daily intake of dairy products, calcium -
fortified products (e.g. bread, cereals, orange juice or soy milk) and other specified calcium -rich 
products. The nu mber of daily servings of calcium defined as 240 mL ( one US cup) in dairy 
products such as milk or yoghurt or of a calcium -fortified product with corresponding calcium 
content (300 mg calcium  per 240mL/one  US cup) or 42g ( 1.5 ounces ) of cheese . As an extre me 
calcium intake has been shown to significantly increase urinary excretion of calcium, subjects 
will be  instructed not to consume more than five daily calcium servings (i.e. 1500 mg calcium). 
The combination of high calcium intake with vitamin D suppleme ntation significantly increases 
urinary calcium. Hence the use of calcium or vitamin D supplements were excluded in this study 
with the exception of stable doses of oral vitamin D (up to 400 IU/day) at baseline with no dose 
adjustment during the study peri od. Systemic safety of MC2 -[ADDRESS_990367]-Baseline HPA 
MC2 Therapeutics  Clinical Trial Protocol  Protocol MC2 -01-C3

- 17 - axis suppression and calcium homeostasis testing will be  performed  only in subjects receiving 
the MC2 -01 cream , without any comp arison to the reference compound.  
 
Data from this trial, together with the  measurements of albumin -corrected serum calcium and the 
calcium:creatinine ratio in urine samples in the phase [ADDRESS_990368] moderate in 
severity according to PGA and involves 20-30% of body sur face area  (BSA ), excluding face, 
genitals and intrigenous areas , in order to evaluate the trial medication under maximum use 
conditions.   
The active ingredients in the investigational products (CAL and  BDP) are known to be effective 
for the treatment of ps orias is. The safety and efficacy profiles for marketed products with these 
ingredients (formulated as ointment, gel/topi[INVESTIGATOR_725507]) are 
well known.  
MC2 -01 cream contains the same active ingredients  at identical concentrations  of CAL and BDP 
as the marketed products  (w/w 0.005%/0.064%)  but in a novel cream formulation that is expected 
to provide better  cosmetic acceptability to patients than the currently available formulation s.  
The side effects rep orted with CAL/BDP topi[INVESTIGATOR_725508].  It is therefore not considered necessary to have analysis of calcium homeostasis 
prior to initiation of treatment.  Subjects in this trial will be monitored for both syst emic and local 
safety during the trial .  
Clinical s igns or symptoms of systemic safety (e .g., hypercalcemia, HPA axis suppression , or 
cardiac safety) will be  part of the periodic assessment of subjects throughout this trial.  In addition, 
for subjects assig ned to the MC2 -[ADDRESS_990369] of MC2 -01 cream on the hypothalamic -pi[INVESTIGATOR_2117] -
adrenal (HPA) axis and calcium metabolism following once daily topi[INVESTIGATOR_725509] -use conditions in subjects with extensive psoriasis vulgaris.  
4.[ADDRESS_990370], MC2 -01 cream, and CAL/BDP ointment  (comparator) are investigated 
in subjects with clinically diagnosed extensive psoriasis vulgaris.  
After h aving provided written informed consent, the subject will undergo screening procedures. 
Subjects who meet the trial entry criteria will be randomly assigned in a 1:1  ratio to receive either 
MC2 -01 cream  or the comparator, CAL/BDP ointment . Subjects assigne d to MC2 -01 cream will 
apply 1  dose of trial medication topi[INVESTIGATOR_231704] 8  weeks and the subjects assigned to the 
comparator will apply 1  dose of trial medication topi[INVESTIGATOR_231704] 4 weeks.  
Please refer to Figure 4-1 for an overview of the t rial design for subjects assigned to the MC2 -01 
cream  and refer to  Figure 4-2 for an overview of the t rial design for subjects assigned to the  active 
comparator.  
Trial  subjects will be enrolled at approximately 10-15 sites in US .  
At Week 4, the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of calcipotriene (CAL), betamethasone dipropi[INVESTIGATOR_16847] 
(BDP) and their main metabolites  MC1080  and betamethasone [ADDRESS_990371] of once -daily use of MC2 -01 cream on the HPA axis and calcium metabolism will be 
evaluated for MC2 -01 cream treatment group. Other safety assessments (local skin reaction s, AEs, 
laboratory tests, electrocardiogram  (ECG )), vital signs and physical examinations) and efficacy 
assessments are also performed.  
The maximum trial duration for each subject  will be approximately 12 or 16 weeks and includes a 
screening pe riod of up to 4 weeks  (if washout of medication is required) , a treatment period of 4 or 
8 weeks, and a follow -up period of up to 4 weeks (if required for follow -up of adverse events, 
calcium concentrations, and/or HPA axis suppression) .  
During the tr ial, the effect of once -daily use of MC2 -01 cream on the HPA axis and calcium 
metabolism will be evaluated  for subjects assigned to the MC2 -01 cream. Systemic exposure will 
be assessed for both treatment groups  at Week 4 , and additionally at Week 8 for the sub jects

in this trial at any time and without providing reaso ns (see also Section 9.2).  A subject's 
participation is to be terminated immediately upon his/her request.  The investigator  should seek 
to obtain the reason and record this on the electronic case report form ( eCRF) whenever possible.  
If, at the time of refusal, a trial product has already been administered, the subject should be 
advised on follow -up safety evaluations.   
If HPA axis is suppressed at Visit 1/D ay [ADDRESS_990382] ( IP) should be discontinue d (see Section 7.9.2  and 
Section 7.16 ).  
If albumin corrected  serum calcium is above upper limit at Visit1/D ay 0, the application with the 
investigational product (IP) should be discontinue d (see Section 7.9.2 ).   
In the case of an SAE or development of a condition that would have met the trial safety -related 
exclusion criteria, the subject should be evaluated by [CONTACT_17062]. The investigator should use 
his/her discretion to determine whether the subject should continue treatment with the IP .  
A subject may be withdrawn from the trial at any time at the discretion of the investigator . The 
reason s for early termination ar e to be fully d ocumented on the eCRF.  
In addition, the MC2  reserves the right to end or suspend the trial at any time (see Section  9.2). 
If a subject withdraws from the trial, all efforts will be made to complete a final evaluation if 
possible. Protocol -specified withdrawal procedures are defined in Section 7.[ADDRESS_990383] is referred to his/her own primary medical 
doctor. The specific AE in question will be recorded on the appropriate eCRF .

Clinical laboratory specimens will be analyzed by a central licensed and accredited laboratory 
facility according to the laboratory’s standard operating procedur es.  
7.9.1 Hematology , biochemistry and urinalysis  
For all subjects t he fo llowing tests will be performed  at Visit 1/Day [ADDRESS_990404] assigned to the MC2 -01 cream at the Week 8  visit: 
• Hematology: hemoglobin, hematocrit, red blood cell ( RBC) count, mean corpuscular 
volume (MCV), white blood cell (WBC) count, including differential count and platelet 
count.  
• Serum biochemistry: cortisol, urea,  glucose,  creatinine, calcium, albumin, calcium 
(albumin corrected), sodium, potassium, chloride, c alcium, phosphate, alkaline 
phosphatase (ALP), plasma  parathyroid  hormone (PTH) .  
25-OH Vitamin D (Visit 1 only)  
Visit 1/Day 0 : If serum albumin -corrected serum calcium  is above the reference range at Visit 
1/Day [ADDRESS_990405] (IP) should be discontinue d and an Early 
Termination visit should be performed (see Section 7.9.2 ). 
Week 4 : If serum albumin -corrected serum calcium  is above the reference range at Week [ADDRESS_990406] should be performed at Week 6. If the serum albumin -corrected serum calcium  is above 
the reference range at Week  8, a follow -up visit is required (see Section 7.15).  
7.9.2 HPA axis suppression/  ACTH challenge test  
For subject s assigned to the MC2 -[ADDRESS_990407] 
with a n intravenous dose of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)  (cosyntropin ). Measurement of 
serum cortisol levels pre - and post - stimulation with cosyntropin  0.[ADDRESS_990408] will be performed at Visit 
1/Day 0, Week [ADDRESS_990409] consists of blood sampling starting at 8 am (± 30 
minutes). Following the blood sample, an intravenous bolus injection of 0.25 mg cosyntropin   is 
given at time zero (t=0 minutes). Serum cortisol concentration at t=[ADDRESS_990410] been establishe d to denote a normal response:   
1. pre-stimulation cortisol levels >5  µg/dL  will be considered normal,   
2. the [ADDRESS_990411] -stimulation level should show an increment of 7 µg/dL above the basal 
level, and  
3. the [ADDRESS_990412] -stimulation level should exceed 1 8 µg/dL.  
Therefore, a basal serum cortisol level 5 µg/dL, or a [ADDRESS_990413] -stimulation level  
18 µg/dL, or a post -stimulation increase (over basal) <7  µg/dL constitutes the definition of 
HPA axis suppression in the trial. 
Visit 1/Day 0 : If HPA axis is suppressed at Visit 1/Day [ADDRESS_990414] (IP) should be discontinue d and an Early 
Termination visit should be performed (see  Section 7.16). 
Week 4 : If HPA axis is suppress ed at Week [ADDRESS_990415] return for a follow -up visit ( see Section 7.15).  
7.9.3 Food diary: calcium -rich nutrients

For follow -up on urine analysis only spot samples are performed.  
7.9.5 Pharmacoki netics  
For all subjects , samples for PK testing  will be collected  though an untreated area of the skin,  at 
the following time points:  
• SV2/baseline  visit: single time point  
• Week 2  visit: single time point  
• Week 4  visit: before application of IP at the visit  and then at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 5, and [ADDRESS_990418] ed at the  
following time points:   
• Week 8 visit: before application of trial medication  at the visit  and then at 0.5, 1, 2, 3,  
5, and [ADDRESS_990419] may 
be needed a few days before the scheduled visit.  
The samples will be assayed for concentrations of the active ingredients ( BDP  and CAL ) and for 
their major metabolites (betamethasone 17 -propi[INVESTIGATOR_725513]180, respectively)  
7.10 Electrocardiogram  
For all subjects  assigned to the MC2 -01 cream , a 12-lead ECG will be recorded at Visit 1/Day 0,  
Week [ADDRESS_990420] after 5 minutes’  rest in supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547].  
Recordings will be promptly transmitted to the central ECG vendor for interpretation. Additional 
(unscheduled) ECGs can be recorded for safety reasons at any time based on the judgment of the 
investigator.  
Clinically significant findings will be reported as medical history if detected at Visit 1/Day [ADDRESS_990421] be completed by [CONTACT_725532]. The PRO assessments are to be performed as specified in the visit 
schedule ( see Table 7-2, and Table 7-3).  
The aim of the Psoriasis Treatment Convenience Scale is to assess th e impact and convenience of 
psoriasis treatment. The scale has been tested for content validity through focus group interview 
with 20 patients and adapted based on the responses. The scale consists of 5 disease -specific, self -
report questions with a recall  period of 1 week and rated on a 1 -10 scale.   
1. How easy was the treatment to apply to the skin?   
2. How greasy was the treatment when applying it to the skin?  
3. How moisturised  did your skin feel after applying the treatment?  
4. How much did treating your skin dis rupt your daily routine?  
5. Overall, how satisfied were you with the medical treatment?

Table 7 -1, Table 7-2 and Table 7-3. 
7.12.1  Physician’s global assessment of psoriasis severity  
The Physician’s Global Assessment (PGA) measures the investigator’s or designee’s impression 
of the disease at a single point using a defi ned, 5-point, static PGA scale (clear, almost clear, 
mild, moderate  or severe); see Table 7-5. The PGA  assessment will represent the average  lesion 
severity on scalp, trunk  and limbs  (excluding face, genitals, and intertriginous areas ). The 
assessments will be based on the condition of the disease at the time of evaluation, and not in 
relation to the condition at a previous visit.

the total BSA, estimating that the surface of the subject’s full, flat palm (including the five digits) 
correlates to approximately 1% of the total BSA. If the subject has psoriasis of guttatae character, 
these el ements will be part of the estimation of total psoriatic involvement . The purpose of this is 
to obtain an estimate of the area on the trunk  and limbs to be treated with trial medication.

records and on the app ropriate eCRF.  
Any AE that is considered related to the trial product must be followed by [CONTACT_725533]; all relevant follow -up information 
will be reported to the MC2 or desig nee. 
The outcome of an AE will be classified as recovered, recovered with sequelae, 
recovering/resolving, ongoing, or death.  
7.13.2  Timing  
AEs will be collected/ assessed during the period from the time of the signature [CONTACT_725552] [CONTACT_725534] -related activity performed.  
7.13.3  Severity  of adverse events  
The investigator is to classify the severity (intensity) of an AE according to the following 
definitions:  
• Mild – The subject was aware of the signs and symptoms but the signs and symptoms were 
easily tolerated  and does not interfere with daily activity.  
• Moderate – The signs and symptoms were sufficient to restrict, but did not prevent, usual 
daily activity for the su bject.  The subject is still able to function.  
• Severe – The subject was unable to perform usual daily activity.  
MC2 Therapeutics  Clinical Trial Protocol  Protocol MC2 -01-C3 
20 December  2017  
 
- 44 - The maximum intensity of an AE (mild, moderate, or severe) will be assessed taking into 
account the possible range of intensity of the symptom(s ). 
7.13.4  Relationship  of an adverse event to trial treatment  
The investigator is responsible to assess the relationship of an AE to the IP using good clinical 
judgment and the following definitions:  
Not Related  The AE is clearly explained by [CONTACT_725535] ; the temporal relationship of the AE to IP 
administration makes a causal relationship unlikely, or, concomitant 
medication, therapeutics interventions, or underlying condition provide 
a sufficient explanation for t he observed AE  
Possibly Related  The AE and administration of trial product are temporally related, but 
the AE c an be explained equally well by [CONTACT_725536], and the AE is 
more likely explained by [CONTACT_725537], and a direct 
association can be demonstrated.  Concomitant medicat ion, therapeutics 
interventions, or underlying conditions do not provide a sufficient 
explanation for the observed AE  
7.13.5  Unexpected adverse events  
Any AE assessed as related to the IP will be assessed for expectedness by [CONTACT_36613]. 
An AE is con sidered “unexpected” if its nature or severity is not consistent with information in the 
MC2 -01 Investigator’s Brochure (for MC2 -01 cream)26 or Taclonex® Ointment prescribing 
information27 (for active comparator) . 
 “Unexpected” as used in this definition, also refers to AEs that are mentioned in the Investigator’s 
Brochure or product prescribing information as occurring with a class of drugs or as anticipated 
from the pharmacological properties  of the drug, but are not specifically mentioned as occurring 
with the particular drug under investigation.  
 
 
 
MC2 Therapeutics  Clinical Trial Protocol  Protocol MC2 -01-C3 
[ADDRESS_990429] dose under 
clinical investigation or the known therapeutic dose, will be fully documented even if no toxic 
effects were observed and will be considered an AE.  
The maximum weekly  dose of the MC2 -01 cream  and the comparator  is 100 g . The  treated area 
should not be >30% of the body surface area.   
 
Use above the recommended dose may cause elevated serum calcium , which should rapi[INVESTIGATOR_725516]. Excessive prolonged use of topi[INVESTIGATOR_725517] p ituitary -adrenal functions, resulting in secondary adrenal insufficiency that is usually

and not later than within 24  hours of his/her  knowledge of the occurrence of the pregnancy (see 
Section 13.2).  
Investigator must actively follow -up, document and report to MC2 or designee the progress of the 
pregnancy until outcome is reached.

• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening  
• Requires in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_346966]  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or is an impo rtant medical event  
• Other serious or important medical event  
The death of a subject enrolled in a trial is per se not an event, but an outcome. Any event resulting 
in a fatal outcome must be fully documented and reported, regardless of the causality relat ionship 
to the IP.  
Any medical important events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_725518], based on appropriate medical judgment, they 
may jeopardi se the subject or the subject may require m edical or surgical intervention to prevent 
one of the outcomes listed in the above definitions.

[ADDRESS_990432] be reported immediately to the 
MC2 or designee as soon as it becomes known to the investigator and not later than within 24  hours 
of his/her knowledge of the occurrence of an SAE (see Section 13.2). The investigator will 
document such events in the best possible detail on the SAE Report Form.  
A suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction  (S[LOCATION_003]R) is an SAE that is both unexpected 
(not consistent with the current Investigator’s Brochure1 or Taclonex® Ointment  prescribing 
information ,3, and for which there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug 
and the SAE. The Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) will be 
informed of S[LOCATION_003]RS according to local requirements. All investigators participating in the trial 
will also be notified o f unexpected SAEs.  The sponsor will report SAEs and other ev ents 
requiring expedited reporting to regulatory authorities as required.   
Investigator  instructions for reporting SAEs  are provided in Section 13.2.

8.0 STATISTICAL METHODS AND DETERMINATION OF SAMPLE SIZE  
STATISTICAL AND ANALYTICAL PLANS  
8.1 General Considerations  for Data Analysis  
The methodology presented below represents a brief overview of the statistical methods that will 
be fully detailed in the statistical analysis plan (SAP). The SAP will be finali sed before the 
database is locke d. Any changes to the methods described in the final SAP will be described and 
justified in the clinical trial report. All statistical analyses will be performed using SAS statistical 
software (Version 9.2 or higher).  
It is planned that the data from all centres  that participate in this protocol will be combined so that 
an adequate number of subjects will be available for analysis. No imputation will be made for 
missing data.  
8.[ADDRESS_990436] to common practice in maximum use studies evaluating 
pharmacokinetic profiles and evidence of HPA safety.  The chosen number of approximately 25 
subjects inclu ded in the PK population  at Week 4 in each treatment arm is considered sufficient 
to compare the PK properties corresponding to the two treatments . 
8.3 Analysis Populations  
The analysis populations are defined as follows:  
• PK population:  all subjects in the Sa fety population  who have received the planned 
application of treatment at the Week [ADDRESS_990437]-application blood draw for PK assessment  at the corresponding visit . 
MC2 Therapeutics  Clinical Trial Protocol  Protocol MC2 -01-C3 
20 December  2017  
 
- 48 - • Safety population:  all subjects who are randomized and have been dispensed the trial 
medication at Randomi sation/Day 0 , excluding subjects who return all of the trial 
medication unopened.  The Safety population will be used for all safety analyses  other than 
evaluation of the HPA -axis.  
• HPA popu lation:  all subjects in the Safety population that are assigned to MC2 -01 cream 
and who show normal HPA function at Baseline.  Since the objective of the  analysis is to 
estimate the risk to subjects with normal HPA function of HPA -axis suppression followin g 
treatment, subjects who meet the definition of HPA -axis suppression at Baseline will be 
excluded from the analysis.  The HPA population will be used for the HPA axis suppression 
analysis.  
8.4 Background and Demographic Characteristics  
Descriptive statistics w ill be used to summari se demographic characteristics (age, sex, and race) 
and background characteristics for the Safety  population .  Past/coexistent medical history 
information , physical examination observations , and vital signs information for all randomi sed 
subjects will be presented in a by -subject listing.   
8.5 Trial  Medication /Exposure  
Descriptive statistics will be used to summari se trial medication exposure for the Safety 
population.   Measure s of trial medication exposure will include the total duration  of treatment, the 
total weight of trial medication used, and the total number of applications.    
8.[ADDRESS_990438] listing.   
8.7 Analysis o f Pharmacokinetics  
All available concentration results will be summari sed using appropriate descriptive statistics for 
active ingredients (BDP and CAL) and for their major metabolites. Me dian and individual 
concentration versus time curves will be plotted (linear and semi -log plots).  
Plasma PK parameters ( AUC 0-t, AUC 0-∞, AUC 0-7, Cmax, Tmax, and  T½) will be calculated at Week 4 
and Week 8 (subjects randomi sed to MC2 -01 cream only).  The PK parameters  AUC 0-[ADDRESS_990439] formulas  inserting the lower limit of quantification for non -
quantifiable levels of the analyte ; therefore, AUC 0-[ADDRESS_990440] one time 
point shows a non -quantifiable level of the analyte,  and Cmax will be an upper limit in case all tim e 
points show non -quantifiable levels of the analyte . For a given analyte, the PK parameters AUC 0-t, 
AUC 0-∞, Tmax, and  T½ will be calculated if data allow . The PK parameters will be summari sed 
using appropriate descriptive statistics  including median, lower and upper quartiles, minimum and 
maximum .

- 49 - Assessment of systemic exposure  (Week 4)  
Assessment of  relative systemic exposure  in the two treatment arms  will be performed for AUC 0-7 
and C max at Week 4 . It will be based on an analysis of variance for censored data  for each 
parameter, assuming a log -normal distribution of the PK parameter . Geometric mean ratio and 
associated 90% confidence interval will be presented.   
8.8 Analysis of Safety  
The assessment of HPA axis suppression (using pre - and post -stimulation cortisol levels) and of 
changes in calcium metabolism are the primary safety endpoints in this trial.  
Other assessments of safety will be based mainly on the frequency of AEs and on the number of 
laboratory values that fall outside of predetermined ranges , presented for the two periods, Weeks 
1 to 4 and Weeks 5 to 8 , separately . Adverse events will be presented in data listings and 
summarized by [CONTACT_725538] .  Laboratory and 
vital sign data will be presented in data listings.  Abnormal laboratory findings will be presented.  
The analysis of safety will be described in the SAP.  
8.8.1 HPA -axis suppression  
The number and proportion of subjects with HPA -axis suppression at Week 4  and Week 8 will b e 
summari sed.   
8.8.2 Calcium metabolism endpoints  
Summary statistics will be provided for the following:   
Observed values of and changes from B aseline to Week 4 and Week 8 in:  
– Albumin -corrected  serum calcium  
– 24 hours urinary calcium excretion  
– Ratio of urinary calcium to creatinine  
8.8.3 Adverse events  
Adverse events will be coded using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) 
terminology.  Treatment -emergent adverse events will be summarized by [CONTACT_725539], incidence by [CONTACT_29865], and incidence by [CONTACT_49240].  
Each subject will contribute only once (e.g., the first occurrence) to each of the rates, regardless of 
the number of occurrences (events) the subject experiences.  Treatment -emergent AEs will be  
summari sed by [CONTACT_926] (mild, moderate, or severe), and by [CONTACT_725540] (none, 
unlikely, possible, probable, or definite). An adverse event is treatment -emergent if its date of 
onset is Day 1 (Baseline) or later.  
MC2 Therapeutics  Clinical Trial Protocol  Protocol MC2 -01-C3 
[ADDRESS_990441] data.  
Clinical laboratory data will be summarized by [CONTACT_725541] (baseline to most extreme post -baseline value), by [CONTACT_725542] (means, medians, SDs, ranges), and by [CONTACT_725543].  
Data from other tests ( e.g., vital signs, ECG results) will be considered as appropriate and listed. 
Notable values will be flagged, and any other information collected will be listed as appropriate. 
Any statistical tests performed to explore the data will be used only to highlight an y interesting 
comparisons that may warrant further consideration.  
Vital signs will be summari sed at each visit, both as absolute values and as change from Baseline,

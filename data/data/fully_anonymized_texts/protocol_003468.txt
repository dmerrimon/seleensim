Purpose:  
  
1. The primary endpoint of the study would be to determine the safety of dalteparin 
as prophylaxis against deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in orthopaedic oncology patients.  Specifically, the goal of the study is to determine whether there are significantly increased bleeding complications at the surgical site after major oncologic operations in the lower extremity . 
 
a. The study would help establish specific parameters for use of dalteparin in complex orthopaedic oncology patients.  Not all patients would be appropriate for this medication, particularly those with massive hemorrhage during surgery and those with underlying coagulopathies.  
b. It is likely that patients requiring limited tumor excision, particularly those with metastatic carcinoma, woul d be ideal candidates for dalteparin therapy.  
c. Patients who require radical resections of tumor may need stricter guidelines for the safe use of the medication, since the potential for post -
operative bleeding may be greater.  
 
Hypotheses:  
 
1. Dalteparin may be used safely in complex group of patients such as orthopaedic 
oncology patients, provided that strict guidelines are followed with regard to indications for therapy.  
 2. Patents with metastatic carcinoma affecting the osseous skeleton would be good candidates for treatment since they generally have limited surgical resections and 
a pre- disposition to formation of DVTs.  
 
3. The use of dalteparin would result in a low rate of DVTs that would compare favorably against historical controls.  
 
Introduction:  
 It is well recognized that patients undergoing orthopaedic procedures such as total knee replacements and total hip replacements, are at increased risk of venous thrombo-embolic events.
1, [ADDRESS_745072] previous study was performed at Memorial Sloan- Kettering Cancer Center.  
This study focused on the role of mechanical compression boots in orthopaedic oncology patients.
6  As expected, there is a high rate of proximal DVT’s in the thigh even with 
mechanical prophylaxis (17%).  This study did not address the potential use of low molecular weight heparins or other forms of anti -coagulation.  Preliminary results from a

as prophylaxis for deep venous thrombosis.
[ADDRESS_745074] injury.   There was no statistically significant difference in rates 
of DVT or bleeding complications.11  Similar findings were reported in another randomized 
trial in hip fracture patients.12   
 In spi[INVESTIGATOR_567250]’ concerns, it is reasonable to postulate that given the favorable safety profile of dalteparin, it can be used in this study population.  The key to using the medication would be to establish firm criteria for the safe use of the drug.  
 The hypothesis is that the drug is safe for the patient population identified in this study.  Most of the published safety data on the drug pertains to general orthopaedic patients and not to orthopaedic oncology patients.  This study is intended to provide preliminary data on benefits and risks for orthopaedic  oncology patients.  
 Orthopaedic oncology encompasses a wide array of patients.  Some patients are healthy and normal except for their tumor.  Other patients may be moribund with multiple co-morbidities.  Some patients require a relatively small procedure to remove the tumor, while others require massive resections and reconstructions.  The risk of post -operative 
bleeding complications for these patients would be expected to vary considerably.  
 As the first step toward establishing the use of dalteparin in orthopaedic oncology 
patients, it is proposed that two target populations be studied.  One group of patients is 
DVT Prophylaxis in Orthopaedic Oncology Patients - A Pi[INVESTIGATOR_16116]
2004-[ADDRESS_745075] 6 – [ADDRESS_745076] extremely large 
tumors or those who become coagulopathic during surgery as a result of massive 
hemorrhage ought to be excluded.  Patients with superficial and small T1 (< 5 cm) tumors will also be excluded, since the soft tissue concerns are minimal in such patients.  The goal is to establish the safe use of dalteparin in the moderate risk group first.  This would 
become the starting point for a subsequent study on managing DVT risk in the patients at higher risk for complications.  
 It is important to note that the underlying DVT rate in the pre- operative population is not 
well-established.  It is reasonable to hypothesize that there is a substantial rate of pre-
existing DVTs in patients with skeletal tumors.  However, there are currently no guidelines with regard to screening of such patients.   Pre-operative Doppler  ultrasound examinations 
are not yet considered to be standard of care.  If a substantial rate of DVTs is found, then a compelling case may be made for not just pre- operative DVT screening, but also regular 
routine screening of cancer patients.  
 It is well recognized that duplex Doppler  ultrasound does not detect all DV Ts.  It is most 
suited to detecting 95 – 100%.
13  However, in well -controlled studies, the sensitivity is 
less, approximately 80%, and this may depend in part upon the experience of the ultrasonographer.  Venography  is still considered superior in terms of sensitivity.  The

ease of duplex doppler ultrasound study make it suitable as the method for detecting DVTs in this study.  
 This safety study is really part of an effort to develop a rational, comprehensive plan for management of DVT risk in a heterogeneous population of patients.  An important part of the management algorithm is screening for DVT in high risk groups.  Another important part of the management is developi[INVESTIGATOR_567251] p atients.  
The initial phase of the study is geared towards establishing preliminary data on underlying rates of DVT, establishing the safe and effective use of dalteparin in certain patients with metastatic disease, and testing the safety of dalteparin in a subset of patients undergoing major sarcoma resections.  
 
Background Drug Information for Dalteparin14 
 
Use 
Prevention of deep vein thrombosis which may lead to pulmonary embolism, in patients requiring abdominal surgery who are at risk for thromboembolism complications (i.e., patients >40 years of age, obese, patients with malignancy, history of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, and surgical procedures requiring general anesthesia and lasting longer than 30 minutes).  
 Contraindications  
Hypersensitivity to dalteparin or any component of the formulation; thrombocytopenia 
associated with a positive in vitro  test for antiplatelet antibodies  in the presence of 
dalteparin; hypersensitivity to heparin or pork products; patients with active major 
bleeding; patients with unstable angina or non-Q- wave MI undergoing regional 
anesthesia; not for I.M. or I.V. use.  
 
Warnings/Precautions  
Patients with recent or anticipated neuraxial anesthesia (epi[INVESTIGATOR_567252]) are at risk of spi[INVESTIGATOR_567253].  
 Consider risk versus benefit prior to neuraxial anesthesia.  Risk is increased by [CONTACT_567262], as well as traumatic or repeated epi[INVESTIGATOR_567254].  Patient should be observed closely for bleeding if dalteparin is 
administered during or immediately following diagnostic lumbar puncture, epi[INVESTIGATOR_24686], or spi[INVESTIGATOR_18227].  
 Not to be used interchangeable (unit for unit) with heparin or any other low molecular weight heparins.  Use with caution in patients with known hypersensitivity to

methylparaben or propylparaben.  Use with caution in patients with history of heparin-
induced thrombocytopenia.  Monitor patient closely for signs or symptoms of bleeding.  Certain patients are at increased risk of bleeding.  Risk factors include bacterial endocarditis; congenital or acquired bleeding disorders; active ulcerative or angiodysplastic GI diseases; severe uncontrolled hypertension; hemorrhagic stroke; or use shortly after  brain, spi[INVESTIGATOR_1304], or ophthalmology surgery; in patients treated concomitantly 
with platelet inhibitors; recent GI bleeding; thrombocytopenia or platelet defects; severe liver disease; hypertensive or diabetic retinopathy; or in patients undergoing invasive procedures.  Use with caution in patients with severe renal failure (has not been studied).  
Safety and efficacy in pediatric patients have not been established.  Rare cases of thrombocytopenia with thrombosis have occurred.  Multidose vials contain benzyl alcohol and should not be used in pregnant women.  Heparin can cause hyperkalemia by [CONTACT_567263].  Similar reactions could occur with LMWHs.  Monitor for hyperkalemia.  
 Adverse Reactions  
 1% to 10%  
     Hematologic:  Bleeding (3% to 5%), wound hematoma (0.1% to 3%)  
   Local:  Pain at injection site (up to 12%), injection site hematoma (0.2% to 7%)  
 <1% (Limited to important or life- threatening):  
  Thrombocytopenia (including heparin- induced thrombocytopenia), allergic 
reaction (fever, pruritus, rash, injections site reaction, bullous eruption), anaphylactoid reaction, operative site bleeding, gastrointestinal bleeding, skin necrosis.  Spi[INVESTIGATOR_567255], resulting in paralysis.  Risk is increased in patients with indwelling epi[INVESTIGATOR_567256].  
 Drug Interactions  
 Drugs which affect platelet function (e.g., aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], NSAIDs, dipyridamole, ticlopi[INVESTIGATOR_5325], 
clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745]) may potentiate the risk of hemorrhage.  
 Thrombolytic agents increase the risk hemorrhage.  
 Warfarin:  Risk of bleeding may be increased during concurrent therapy.  Dalteparin is commonly continued during the initiation of warfarin therapy to assure anticoagulation and to protect against possible transient hypercoagulability.

25. Patients taking COX -[ADDRESS_745087] fragmented mechanical heart valves.  
 
Study Design  The study design will be an open- label, non -randomized clinical trial involving 25 – 35 
consecutive patients in each of the two groups.  Historical controls from this institution will be used to compare peri -operative bleeding events, drainage, transfusion requirements, 
and re- operation rates in similar patients who did not receive chemical prophylaxis for 
DVT.  Published historical controls will be used to compare the DVT rate.  The rate of DVT will be measured in this study, but the primary objective is to examine bleeding complications at the surgical site.  The sample size therefore is not calculated to establish efficacy, which has been demonstrated for patients in general in numerous previous articles.  
 The study design will be an open- label, non -randomized clinical trial involving 25 – [ADDRESS_745088] patients who did not receive, data from the previously published article by [CONTACT_567264]. al. will be used for the control group of patients with mechanical compression stockings alone.  Patients will receive a combination of  dalteparin, bilateral TED hose, and bilateral mechanical 
compression stockings while in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  
 Method of DVT Prophylaxis  
 Patients will receive a combination of dalteparin, bilateral TED hose, and bilateral mechanical compression stockings while in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  
 The reason for employing both mechanical prophylaxis and dalteparin together is as follows.  DVT prophylaxis is very difficult to achieve.  The DVT rate is never zero.  There is a very little, if any, adverse effects of using mechanical compression stockings. However, from the previous study at Memorial Sloan- Kettering, it is known that there is 
still a significant rate of DVT (17%) with mechanical prophylaxis.  Dalteparin and other low molecular weight heparins may improve upon this rate.  There is no contraindication 
to using both dalteparin and mechanical prophylaxis together.  The study is not intended to show that dalteparin obviates the need for mechanical prophylaxis.   
DVT Prophylaxis in Orthopaedic Oncology Patients - A Pi[INVESTIGATOR_16116]
2004-[ADDRESS_745089] TED hose and a mechanical compression stocking on the unaf fected extremity.  For the operative leg TED hose and mechanical compression 
stocking will be applied in the recovery room.  
 Patients will be mobilized out of bed with physical therapy as soon as deemed safe by [CONTACT_30951] (generally post -operative day 1).  
 Patients will not continue dalteparin after discharge from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  Patients are generally able to ambulate independently upon discharge, and are considered at reduced risk for DVT.  
 Dosing of Dalteparin  
 
1. The unit dose will be 5000 units of dalteparin.  
2. The dosing will be once a day.  
3. The rouge of administration will be subcutaneous injection.  
4. The medication will start 12 – [ADDRESS_745090] -operative day #1.  
5. The medication will continue daily while the patient is in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  A follow -up 
doppler ultrasound study will be obtained prior to discharge (post -operative day 5 
– 14). 
 Screening for DVT  
 Each patient must have a pre- operative, bilateral doppler ultrasound study of the lower 
extremity veins, including the popliteal to the common femoral veins.  
 Patients will receive a post -operative bilateral doppler ultrasound study of the operative 
limb prior to discharge home (generally post -operative day 5 – 14). 
 The patients will be monitored by [CONTACT_567265][INVESTIGATOR_307].  Signs 
of acute DVT include pain, tenderness to deep palpation, swelling and a positive Homan’s sign.  Both legs will be monitored by [CONTACT_5148].  Patients suspected of acute DVT will undergo emergent doppler ultrasound study.  Signs of pulmonary embolus (PE) include shortness of breath, pleuritic chest pain, dyspnea, hypoxia, and an arterial -alveolar 
oxygen gradient.  Patients suspected of acute PE will u ndergo emergent chest computed 
tomography and/or ventilation- perfusion lung sc an.

Statistical Considerations 
 
The main purpose of this safety study is to evaluate the safety of dalteparin in patients undergoing orthopaedic oncologic procedures.  There is remarkably little information for the drug i n patient population.  The main concern is that the drug could lead to increased 
bleeding, hematomas, seromas, and wound problems.  The safety study is intended to gather preliminary data that potentially could be used to formulate a larger study on DVT prophylaxis.  For the safety study, it seems reasonable to institute a stop rule.  The stop 
rule will terminate the study in case the drug leads to an unacceptable rate of adverse events.  The stop rules should not be based upon an arbitrary amount of post -operative 
drainage or weeks is a much better measure to use.  This is discrete event that is a common final outcome for unacceptable woun d bleeding, large ser omas and hematomas, 
and other wound problems.  
 Two groups of patients will be evaluated in 2 independent cohorts, 1) patients who require major resection of sarcomas in the lower extremity, and 2) patients with metastatic 
disease of the lower extremity.  There is little information about safety and efficacy of dalteparin in these two patient groups.  Kn owledge gained from the treatment of these 
patients will be used to design larger, more definitive studies.  Twenty -five patients will be 
treated in the metastatic cohort and 30 patients in the sarcoma cohort.  A total of 50 – [ADDRESS_745092] 4 weeks after surgery.   In the 
sarcoma group, surgery can be extensive and clinical experience indicates that approximately 10% of patients will require re -operation within 4 weeks.
15-17  A 25% re-
operation rate in this group of patients would be considered excessive.  For the metastatic patient group, the surgery is typi[INVESTIGATOR_567258]- operation rate during the 
first 4 weeks is near zero. 
18 (we assume 3%) and a 15% re- operation rate would be 
considered excessive.  We will monitor this endpoint separately for these two patient groups using the sequential probability ratio test (Goldman 1987).

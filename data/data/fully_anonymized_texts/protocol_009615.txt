4. SUMMARY  
 
Study Title:  To examine the effect of Horizant  (Gabapentin Enacarbil) in primary 
Restless legs syndrome (RLS) patients who  are on dopamine rgic agents  and exhibiting 
augmentation . 
 
Objectives:  
The Primary objective : is to evaluate the efficacy of  Dopamine combined therapy with addition 
of Horizant (600 mg, oral, once daily)  for 90 days  in the treatment  of Augmentation . 
 
The Secondary objectives : is to evaluate the efficacy of Horizant (600 mg, oral, once daily)  
alone with Dopaminergic (DA) taper  for up to 270 days  in the treatment of Augmentation.  
 
Study Design:   
 
This is an Open label single arm study . The purpose of the study is to demonstrate the 
efficacy of Horizan t in patients with RLS who exhibit augmentation while on Dopaminergic 
therapy. Adult patients (age 18 -85 years) with diagnosis of primary RLS (diagnos ed by [CONTACT_83671]) with augmentation on dopaminergic therapy will be screened for participation 
in the study. RLS diagnosis will be made by [CONTACT_279091]. Patients with a ugmentation on dopaminergic  therapy  as defined by [CONTACT_4289] 
2007  (refer to attachment ) with ASRS of [ADDRESS_340648] of the University of Missouri.  
 
A total of 50 subjects will be entered into the study over a period of 1 year. Written consent 
will be obtained from all patients. After  pre-participation evaluation for eligibility, subjects  
will be selected and enrolled in the study and followed for a total of 6 follow up  visits (Days 
0, 30, 90, 120, 180, 36 0). Subjects Enrollment period will last  up to 12 months.  The total 
duration of study will be 24 months . 
 
Pubmed  search (using words Horizant, Augmentation) pulled out several articles (see 
attachments) indicating Horizant is the “only FDA approved Non -Dopaminergic D rug” used 
in the treatment of RLS . Its predictable bioavailability, acceptable safety profile and no case 
reports of augmentation after its use, in the literature makes  Horizant the best-suited drug for 
conducting a c linical drug trial  focused on  examining its potential benefit  in RLS patients 
who developed augmentation.  
 
Abrupt withdrawal of DA agent can  be potentially dangerous due to DA withdrawal 
symptoms including life -threatening Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome. Therefore, Rx Phase 
[ADDRESS_340649] tolerability.

Therefore, during Rx Phase 1, Horizant  (600 mg oral once daily at 5 pm) will be added on as 
an adjunct to all subjects’ along with stable dose of their current dopaminergic (DA) agent 
and both medications will be continued  for a total period of 90 days from day 0 to day 90.  
 
At the 90th day  follow-up visit , with initiation of Rx Phase 2, all subjects w ill be taper ed off 
(by 50 % reduction in dose each week) of their current dopaminergic agent  while maintaining 
the same dose of Horizant and will be on Horizant monotherapy . All subjects will be 
followed for additional three follow up cli nic visits (days 120, 180, 36 0). 
 
During this peri od all subjects will be monitored for symptoms of dopamine withdrawal  or 
worsening of RLS or emergence of other symptoms  which will be managed clinically by 
[CONTACT_13922] . All subjects will continue to be on Horizant for the entire duration of this study 
with close follow up .  Of note, i f deemed appropriate for reasons related to  safety, 
tolerability, and continuation of the study, the PI , at his discretion , may modify the tapering 
schedule of the DA although every attempt will be made to adhere to the protocol specified 
schedule of DA tapering.  
 
During each clinic visit all subjects will undergo careful evaluations (by a physician) that will 
include:  medica l history such as  appearance of any new health problems , any new symptoms / 
adverse events  between clinic visits , concomitant medication (s) history  (medication 
reconciliation),  physical examination  with assessment of vi tal signs , ASRS, IRLS, RLS -
QOL, and MOS-SS.  
 
All subjects will undergo laboratory testing (CBC with  Diff and CMP)  during screening, on 
day 30 and day 360 (final clinic visit). In addition,  urine sample will be collected at screen 
visit for illegal drug testing. Additional hematology and urine  sample analysis  for illegal drug  
will be performed as needed at the discretion of the investigators if an adverse event is 
reported by a subject.  Serum Ferritin level will be performed  as needed at the discretion of 
the investigators.  
 
Urine pregnancy screening is required for all females of childbearing potential at s creen and 
each clinical visits, if positive, serum pregnancy test will be performed. Female subjects who 
have undergone surgical sterilization, who are post -menopausal (defined as age >50 and >1 
year of amenorrhea), who have medically documented ovarian failure (defined as age <50 
with serum estradiol and follicle -stimulating hormone [FSH] levels within the institutional 
postmenopausal range and a negative serum or urine βHCG) do not need to undergo 
pregnancy screening.  
 
At study completion, appropriate statistical analysis will be performed to evaluate the 
outcomes. We plan to publish the findings and results of this study .

5. BACKGROUND  
5.1 Study Rationale : 
RLS is common condition that is usually treated with dopaminergic medications. 
Augmentation is the main complication during long -term DA treatment of RLS . It was first 
described in 1996 with overall increase in severity of RLS symptoms  typi[INVESTIGATOR_279081] -dopaminergic therapy  with earlier occurrence  of sympto ms and involvement of 
previously uninvolved extremities . It can be a very devastating experience in some patients. 
Augmentation is reported in up to 82% of people taking levodopa  (Allen RP, Earley CJ. 
Augmentation of the restless legs syndrome with carbidopa/levodopa. Sleep 1996;19:205 -13) 
 
Features  of Augmentation include earlier onset of RLS symptoms, increased severity of 
symptoms, reduced time before symptoms begin when resting, spread of symptoms to 
previously uninvolved body parts, and reduced  effectiveness of medications including longer 
time before medication begins to work and less ability to decrease symptoms.  
 
Augmentation severity can be assessed by a validated  scale, ASRS , in these patients.  
 
Management of Augmentation has not been studied in clinical trials. Presently, there is no 
appro ved medication  (by [CONTACT_8415]) to treat augmentation. In addition, c urrently , there are no 
specific practice guidelines  as to how to  treat augmen tation . ‘More research is needed to 
identify the optimal approach for treating augmentation once it develops. Sudden withdrawal 
of the offending dopaminergic drug does not appear to be a well-tolerated strategy’ (Kurlan.  
Journal of Parkinsonism & Restless Legs Syn drome Vol 3,  49-52, 2013 ). 
 
Horizant in RLS patients exhibiting a ugmentation :                                                          December 8 , 2017

11 Pubmed search  (conducted in Jan 2015, with key  words “Horizant, Augmentation ”)  revealed 
several articles (see attachments) suggesting that Horizant is the only FDA approved Non -
dopaminergic drug used in the treatment of RLS,  with  predictable bioavailability, 
acceptable safety profile and with any reports of augmentation. Therefore,  we suggest that 
Horizant  may be a best -suited drug to  treat augmentation in RLS patients.  Thus, we propose 
to conduct  a clinical drug tri al to exa mine Horizant in RLS patients who developed 
augmentation.  
 
Abrupt withdrawal of DA agent can be potentially  dangerous  due to DA withdrawal 
symptoms  including life -threatening Neuroleptic Ma lignant S yndrome . Therefore, to 
improve subject tolerability and minimize DA withdrawal, we have designed this clinical 
trial into 2 phases: Rx Phase 1 and Rx Phase 2 (described below)  
 
6. Objectives:  
The Primary objective:  is to evaluate the efficacy of Dopamine combined therapy with addition  
of Horizant (600mg, oral, once daily) for 90 days in the treatment of Augmentation.  
 
The Secondary objectives: is to evaluate the efficacy of Horizant (600 mg, oral, once daily)  alone  
       with Dopaminergic (DA) taper for up to 270 days in the treatment of Augmentation.  
6.1 Study Design :  
This is an Open label Single arm study. The purpose of the study is to demonstrate the 
efficacy of Horizant in patients with RLS who exhibit augmentation while on Dopaminergic 
therapy. Adult patients (age 18 -85 years) with diagnosis of primary RLS (diagnosed by [CONTACT_83671]) with a ugmentation on dopaminergic therapy will be screened for participation 
in the study. RLS diagnosis will be made by [CONTACT_279091]. Patients with augmentation on dopaminergic therapy as defined by [CONTACT_4289] 
2007 (refer to attachment) with ASRS of [ADDRESS_340650] of the University of Missouri.  
 
A tot al of 50 subjects will be entered into the study over a period of 1 year. Written consent 
will be obtained from all patients. After pre -participation evaluation for eligibility, subjects 
will be selected and enrolled in the study and followed for a total o f 6 follow up visits (Days 
0, 30, 90, 120, 180, 360). Subjects Enrollment period will last up to 12 months. T he total 
duration of study is 36  months.  
 
There is no report of Augmentation due to Horizant use in the literature to this date. 
Therefore, initial ly Horizant (600 mg oral once daily at 5 pm) will be added on as an adjunct 
to all subjects’ along with stable dose of their current dopaminergic (DA) agent and both 
medications will be continued for a total period of 90 days from day 0 to day 90.  
 
At the 90th day follow -up visit, while maintaining the same dose of Horizant, all subjects 
will be tapered off (by 50% reduction in dose each week) of their current dopaminergic 
agent. Subsequently all subjects will be followed for additional three follow up clin ic visits 
(days 120, 180, 360). During this period all subjects will be monitored for symptoms of 
dopamine withdrawal or worsening of RLS or emergence of other symptoms which will be

tolerability, and continuation of the study, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_279082]. All subjects will continue to be  on Horizant for the entire duration 
of this study with close follow up.  
 
During each clinic visit all subjects will undergo careful evaluations (by a physician) that will 
include: medical history such as appearance of any new health problems, any new sym ptoms/ 
adverse events between clinic visits, concomitant medication(s) history(medication 
reconciliation), physical examination with assessment of vital signs, ASRS, IRLS, RLS -
QOL, and MOS -SS.  
 
All subjects will undergo laboratory testing (CBC with  Diff a nd CMP)  during screening, on 
day 30 and day 360 (final clinic visit). In addition,  urine sample will be collected at screen  
visit for illegal  drug testing . Additional  hematology and urine sample analysis  for illegal drug  
will be performed as needed at the discretion of the investigators if an adverse event is 
reported by a subject.  Serum Ferritin level  will be performed as needed at the discretion of 
the investigators.  
 
Urine pregnancy screening is required for all females of childbearing potential at s creen and 
each clinical visits, if positive, s erum pre gnancy test  will be performed . Female subjects who 
have undergone surgical sterilization, who are post -menopausal (defined as age >50 and >1

with serum estradiol and follicle -stimulating hormone [FSH] levels within the institutional 
postmenopausal range and a negative serum or urine βHCG) do not need to undergo 
pregnancy screening.

11.1.2  Serious Adverse Events  
In accordance with 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 312.32 and the 
recommendations of the International Conference on Harmonization  (ICH) [Federal 
Regist er, October 7, 1997, Vol. 62, No. 194, pp [ZIP_CODE] -45], any of the following adverse 
events are to be classified as a serious adverse event (SAE):  
 
• An event that results in death.  
• An event that, in the view of the Investigator, places the subject at immediate risk of 
death (a life -threatening event).  This does not include an event that, had it occurred 
in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
• An outcome that results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect diagnosed in a child of a 
subject who par ticipated in this study.  
• An event that requires or prolongs in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
• An event that results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity.  
• Other medically important events that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], may 
jeopardize the subject or may require intervention to prevent one of the other 
outcomes listed in the definition above.  (Examples of such medical events include 
allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or 
convulsions occurring at home tha t do not require an in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].).  
 
If a serious adverse event is unresolved when a subject permanently discontinues the study, 
the subject will be followed until the event resolves or the clinical course is stabilized.  
 
Horizant in RLS patients exhibiting a ugmentation :                                                          December [ADDRESS_340656] ing/Reporting

26 15.2 Appendix II: World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki  
 
Ethical Principles for Medical Research Involving Human Subjects  
 
Adopted by [CONTACT_941] 18th WMA General Assembly  
Helsinki, Finland, June [ADDRESS_340660] the health of the people. The physician's 
knowledge and conscience are dedicated to the fulfillment of this duty.  
 
3. The Declaration of Geneva of the World Medical Association binds the physician with the words, 
“The health of my patient will be my first consideration,” and the International Code of Medical 
Ethics declares that, “A physician shall act only in the patient's interest when providing medical 
care which might have the effect of weakening the  physical and mental condition of the patient.”  
 
4. Medical progress is based on research, which ultimately must rest in part on experimentation 
involving human subjects.  
 
5. In medical research on human subjects, considerations related to the well -being of the human 
subject should take precedence over the interests of science and society.  
 
6. The primary purpose of medical research involving human subjects is to improve prophylactic, 
diagnostic and therapeutic procedures and the understanding of the etiology  and pa thogenesis of 
disease.  Even the best proven prophylactic, diagnostic, and therapeutic methods must 
continuously be challenged through research for their effectiveness, efficiency, accessibility and 
quality.  
 
7. In current medical practice and in medical res earch, most prophylactic, diagnostic and therapeutic 
procedures involve risks and burdens.  
 
8. Medical research is subject to ethical standards that promote respect for all human beings and 
protect their health and rights.  Some research populations are vuln erable and need special 
protection.  The particular needs of the economically and medically disadvantaged must be 
recognized.  Special attention is also required for those who cannot give or refuse consent for

managed.  Physicians should cease any investigation if the risks are found to outweigh the 
potential benefits or if there is conclusive proof of positive and beneficial results.

information and to minimize the impact of the study on the subject's physical and mental  integrity 
and on the personality of the subject.  
 
22. In any research on human beings, each potential subject must be adequately informed of the aims, 
methods, sources of funding, any possible conflicts of interest, institutional affiliations of the 
researche r, the anticipated benefits and potential risks of the study and the discomfort it may 
entail.  The subject should be informed of the right to abstain from participation in the study or to 
withdraw consent to participate at any time without reprisal.  Afte r ensuring that the subject has 
understood the information, the physician should then obtain the subject's freely -given informed 
consent, preferably in writing.  If the consent cannot be obtained in writing, the non -written 
consent must be formally documen ted and witnessed.  
 
23. When obtaining informed consent for the research project the physician should be particularly 
cautious if the subject is in a dependent relationship with the physician or may consent under 
duress.  In that case the informed consent shou ld be obtained by a well -informed physician who is 
not engaged in the investigation and who is completely independent of this relationship.  
 
24. For a research subject who is legally incompetent, physically or mentally incapable of giving 
consent or is a legal ly incompetent minor, the investigator must obtain informed consent from the 
legally authorized representative in accordance with applicable law.  These groups should not be 
included in research unless the research is necessary to promote the health of the  population 
represented and this research cannot instead be performed on legally competent persons.  
25. When a subject deemed legally incompetent, such as a minor child, is able to give assent to 
decisions about participation in research, the investigator must  obtain that assent in addition to the 
consent of the legally authorized representative.  
 
26. Research on individuals from whom it is not possible to obtain consent, including proxy or 
advance consent, should be done only if the physical/mental condition that prevents obtaining 
informed consent is a necessary characteristic of the research population.  The specific reasons 
for involving research subjects with a condition that renders them unable to give informed 
consent should be stated in the experimental prot ocol for consideration and approval of the 
review committee.  The protocol should state that consent to remain in the research should be 
obtained as soon as possible from the individual or a legally authorized surrogate.  
 
27.  Both authors and publishers have ethical obligations.  In publication of the results of research, 
the investigators are obliged to preserve the accuracy of the results.  Negative as well as positive 
results should be published or otherwise publicly available.  Sources of funding, institut ional 
affiliations and any possible conflicts of interest should be declared in the publication.  Reports of 
experimentation not in accordance with the principles laid down in this Declaration should not be 
accepted for publication.

use unproven or new prophylactic, diagnostic and therapeutic measures, if in the physician's judgment 
it offers hope of saving life, re -establishing health or alleviating suffering.  Where possible, these 
measures should be made the object  of research, designed to evaluate their safety and efficacy. In all 
cases, new information should be recorded and, where appropriate, published.  The other relevant 
guidelines of this Declaration should be followed.

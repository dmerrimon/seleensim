Implementation  
 
This Clarification Memo does not change the informed consent form .  
 
The plan is to incorporate the modifications included in this Clarification Memo into the next  full 
protocol amendment. Text noted below with a strikethrough will represent deletion; text appearing 
below in bold  will represent an addition.  
 
1. In Section 8.1, Ef ficacy Assessment s (on page 57 before the Research Laboratory Assays sub-
section) , the paragraph below is being added.  
 
Remote Data Collection  
Study visits may be conducted remotely (e.g., telephone, facetime) in the following 
situations:  
• a participant is unable to attend a visit because of a debilitating illness; the site 
must inform the protocol  team in advance  
• the site is temporarily unable to conduct non -essential visits in the clinic per 
University policies at the time of the visit ; the site must inform the protocol team  
in advance  
• at the discretion of the protocol  team if the risk of an on- site visit is felt to pose 
more risk than potential benefit to the participant; a message from the team will 
be sent to the study team  
Regardless of the situation, the study team should designate which visits were conducted 
remotely and attempt to obtain as much of the visit- specific required information, based 
on the Schedule of E vents , and record it on the relevant study specific checklist . The 
reason for conducting the visit remotely must also be recorded and documented in the 
participant’s study file.   
 
2. In section 7.2, PARTICIPANT DISCONTI NUATION/WITHDRAWAL F ROM THE STUDY, 
in the Early Study Discontinuation sub -section (page 51), 1st bullet is being revised as shown

 2  INTRODUCTION  
 
The Vaccine Research Center (VRC), National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) , and 
Division of AIDS (DAIDS) have collaborated to develop and evaluate VRC07 -523LS, a highly potent and 
broadly neutralizing HIV -1 human monoclonal antibody (m Ab) targeted against the HIV -1 CD4 binding 
site. A similar antibody, VRC01 m Ab, is currently in clinical trials under IND 113,611 (prevention 
indication ) and IND 126,001 and IND 126,664 ( therapeutic indication ). The VRC01mAb  was originally 
discovered in a n HIV-1-infected participant whose immune system controlled the virus without anti-
retroviral therapy  (ART) for over 15 years  (1, 2) . Through advances in B -cell immunology, cloning and 
structure -guided optimization technique s, numerous HIV -1 neutralizing m Abs, including VRC07 (“07” 
denotes sequential numbering when discov ered), VRC07 -523 (“523” denotes sequential numbering 
when engineered variant generated), and later VRC07 -523LS (“LS” denotes 2 amino acid mutations), 
were isolated with potency and breadth greater than those of early antibodies  (3).  
 
The VRC07 (wild -type) heavy chain was identified by 454 deep sequencing based on its similarity to the 
VRC01 m Ab and paired with the VRC01 (wild -type) light chain. The mutations that together define the 
[ADDRESS_374002] amino acid residue of the light chain. The LS designation specifies methionine to leucine  (L) and 
asparagine to serine (S) (M428L/N434S, referred to as LS) changes within the C -terminus of the heavy 
chain constant region. The LS mutation was introduced by [CONTACT_3725] -directed mutagenesis to increase the 
binding affinity for the neonatal Fc -receptor ( FcRn), resulting in increased recirculation of functional IgG 
(4, 5), thus increasing plasma half- life.  
 
The resultant molecule, VRC-HIVMAB075 -00-AB (VRC07 -523LS) , is an investigational drug currently 
being evaluated for the prevention of HIV -1 infection in healthy adults . We propose its study herein 
towards future uses  to clear established HIV infection.   
 
2.1 STUDY R ATIONALE   
 
The inability to eliminate HIV -1 from quiescent, latently infected reservoirs (6 -8) remains the critical 
limitation to HIV eradication. Although combination antiretroviral therapy ( cART) effectively suppresses 
viremia, cART d rugs do not eliminate the latent viral reservoir. W ith a half- life of 3.6 years of the latent 
reservoir, over 70 years of suppressive ART would be required to achieve HIV eradication through ART 
alone (9, 10) . Given the expanding numbers of HIV -infect ed individuals on ART, there is a need for 
innovative therapi[INVESTIGATOR_305598] -1 infection (11) . One approach to eradicate HIV infection, a ‘kick 
and kill’ strategy, is to 1) expose latent, persistent HIV by [CONTACT_305657], and 2) eliminate exposed latently infected cells by [CONTACT_305658]. Antibodies could be used to enhance HIV -specific immune responses as they can 
mediate effector functions such as antibody -dependent cellular cytotoxicity  (ADCC) , antibody -
dependent cellular viral inhibition, and phagocytosis through binding of the Fc portion to receptors on 
the surface of cells such as macrophages and natural killer cells. Further, n ovel and engineered anti -HIV 
antibodies are under study to prevent, treat, and clear infection via these functions  (12).  
 
Over the past several years, there has been a successful  effort to isolate broadly neutralizing 
antibodies (bNAbs) to HIV -1 from  chronically infected individuals (2, 12 -26). Studies have provided  
considerable insight into the sites these antibodies target on HIV -1 and the  mechanisms by [CONTACT_305659] -07 Study  Version 4.0  
Protocol: IGHID [ZIP_CODE] 09 May 2019

 they neutralize HIV -1 (14, 15, 24, 27) . This proposal builds upon the data generated by U01 AI095052, 
which investigated the anti -latency activity of Vorinostat ( VOR ), defining optimal dosing strategies 
(28-30), resulting in our current optimized strategy of interval dosing with VOR every [ADDRESS_374003] ADCC  to clear reactivated HIV -1. We will assess the 
safety and tolerability, as well as the ability of VRC07 -523LS to reduce the frequency of latent, resting 
CD4+ T cell infection in stably treated HIV -infected participants, when combined with pulsatile VOR 
administration.  This study will  evaluate the safety of the combined treatment and e xamine the effect 
of VOR and VRC07 -523LS on persistent replication -competent HIV within resting CD4+ T cells.

One approach to eradicate HIV infection, a ‘kick and kill’ strategy, is to 1) expose latent, persistent HIV 
by [CONTACT_305660], and 2) eliminate exposed latently infected cells by 
[CONTACT_305661] T -cell immune response without interrupting ART. Studies have demonstrated that Histone 
Deacetylase (HDAC) is a critical regulator of HIV latency (28 -30). Our own work has shown that the HDAC 
inhibitor, Vorinos tat, can induce the expression  of latent HIV -1 in vivo ( 28).  As effective dosing 
strategies for latency reversal agents (LRAs) in vivo  are advancing, parallel testing of approaches to 
harness the immune response to clear residual HIV following the disrupt ion of latency  are critical. 
Recent work suggests that the antiviral CD8+ T cell response extant in the majority of HIV -[ADDRESS_374004] been disappointing ( 34-36), likely in part due to the inability 
of the vaccines to produce sustained expansion of HIV specific CD8+ T cells.  Further, archived immune 
escape viral variants within the latent reservoir may present a challenge ( 37). 
 
Antibodies can mediate effector functions such as ADCC, antibody -dependent cellular viral inhibition, 
and phagocytosis through binding of t he Fc portion to receptors on the surface of cells such as 
macrophages and natural killer cells. Novel and engineered anti- HIV antibodies are under study to 
prevent, treat, and clear infection via these functions ( 38).  
 
VRC01 
VRC01  was a first -in-class broadly neutralizing antibody (bnAb) that targets the same CD4+ binding site 
of the HIV -1 envelope  as VRC07 -523LS. VRC01 w as engineered for increased efficacy using next -
generation sequencing, computational bioinformatics, and structure -guided design.  VRC01 has been 
assessed as safe and well tolerated at the 5 -40 mg/kg doses administered intravenously (IV) and at 5 
mg/kg subcutaneously (SC) in both HIV -infected and HIV -uninfected adult populations. The 
pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of passively administered VRC01 were also evaluated. For healthy 
adults who received VRC01 at the 5 -40 mg/kg doses administered IV (n=18), the clearance was 
0.016±0.003 L/h and an overall mean value for the elimination half- life was 15.4±3.9 days . At 5 mg/kg SC  
(n=5), the clearance was 0.029±0.007 L/h, and the mean elimination half- life was 16.6 ± 2.9 days. 
Studies are ongoing to further describe the PK and biological activity of VRC01 after repeat dosing in 
HIV-infected and - uninfected adults. VRC01LS is a VRC0 1 variant with 2 amino acid mutations 
(M428L/N434S, referred to as LS) conferring an increased plasma half -life.

VRC07 -523 
Numerous HIV -1 neutralizing mAbs from the VRC01 family, including VRC07 (“07” denotes sequen tial 
numbering when discovered)  have been isolated from the same individual (donor 45) . The VRC07 (wild -
type) heavy chain was identified by 454 deep sequencing based o n its similarity to the VRC01 m Ab and 
paired with the VRC01 (wild -type) light chain. The mutations that together define the [ADDRESS_374005] amino 
acid residue of the light chain. A resulting variant, VRC07 -523, was 5-  to 8-fold more potent than VRC01, 
neutralized 96% of viruses tested, and displayed minimal autoreactivity.   
 
VRC07 -523LS  
VRC07 -523LS  is an engineered variant of VRC07 that was discovered in the same HIV -1 infected 
participant as VRC01 . The LS designation specifies methionine to leucine (L) and asparagine to serine (S) 
(M428L/N434S, referred to as LS) changes within the C -terminus of the h eavy chain constant region. The 
LS mutation was introduced by [CONTACT_3725] -directed mutagenesis to increase the binding affinity for the 
neonatal Fc -receptor (FcRn), resulting in increased recirculation of functional IgG (4, 5), thus increasing 
plasma half- life. VRC07 -523LS  neutralizes more HIV envelope strains than VRC01 at lower 
concentrations. VRC07 -523LS was found to be 5 -to 8-fold more potent than VRC01, with an inhibitory 
concentration IC50 <50 mcg/mL against 96% of HIV -1 pseudoviruses representing the major circulatin g 
HIV-1 clades and IC50 <1 mcg/mL against 92% of HIV -1 viruses tested and displayed minimal levels of 
autoreactivity  (3). VRC07 -523LS was also shown to have a prolonged half -life over VRC07 by [CONTACT_2902] 2 -
fold.  In vivo proof -of-concept studies showed that VRC07 -523LS is about 5- fold more potent  than 
VRC01LS in Rhesus macaques and displays a longer half- life (9.8 days) than VRC07 (4.9 days) after a 
single do se at 10 mg/kg administered IV (3).  
 
Preclinical studies of VRC07 -523LS  
The proposed VRC07 -523LS dose  for this study  is based on human studies of VRC01, and preclinical and 
clinical studies of VRC07 -523LS.  
 
In nonhuman primate studies, a single dose of VRC07 -523LS 10 mg/kg administered IV in cynomolgus 
macaques had a half- life of about [ADDRESS_374006] 28 days (last collection point) in rectal 
and vaginal secretions and tissues. Complete protection from SHIV -SF162P3 challenge was 
demonstrated with a single IV dose of VRC07 -523LS at 20 mg/kg.  
 
A repeat dose IV and SC toxicity study with VRC07 -523LS was performed in male and female Sprague -
Dawley rats in accordance with “Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) for Nonclinical Laboratory Studies.” 
Treatment with VRC07 -523LS at doses up to 400 mg/kg/dose IV  or 40 mg/kg/dose SC with three doses 
at [ADDRESS_374007] HIV -1 infection in humans in therapeutic settings.   
 
Several in vitro  preclinical safety studies were performed with VRC07 -523LS to assess potential off-
target binding. To measure potential anti- phospholipid cross -reactivity, binding of VRC07 -523LS to 
cardiolipin was assessed using an enzyme -linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and demonstrated 
The VOR -07 Study  Version 4.0  
Protocol: IGHID [ADDRESS_374008] kit (Luminex AtheNA Multi -Lyte® ANA -II 
test) and did cross -react with a small subset of nuclear antigens consistent with some reactivity with 
nuclear antigens. In addition, VRC07 -523LS was assessed for anti- phospholipid properties in a clinical 
activated partial thrombop lastin time (aPTT) assay and compared to the anti -HIV mAbs 4E10 and VRC01 
as well as palivizumab; only 4E10 showed evidence o f antiphospholipid activity. By 
[CONTACT_9064], VRC07 -523LS displayed minimal binding to HEp -2 cells at 50 mcg/mL and no 
bind ing at 25 mcg/mL  (3).  
 
A tissue cross- reactivity (TCR) study was performed in accordance with “Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) 
for Nonclinical Laboratory Studies” to determine the potent ial cross -reactivity of VRC07 -523LS with 
cryosections of human and Sprague -Dawley rat tissues. VRC07 -523LS staining was similar between the 
human and rat tissues examined, although staining tended to be somewhat more intense and frequent 
in the human tissu e compared to the Sprague -Dawley rat tissues. According to ICH S6 ( R1), monoclonal 
antibody binding to cytoplasmic sites generally is considered of little to no toxicologic significance. See 
the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) for further details.  
 
Clinical Studies  of VRC01  
VRC-07-523LS  is a similar product to VRC01 and its variant VRC01LS, and there is substantial clinical 
experience with both VRC01 and VRC01LS mAbs as described below .  
 
VRC 601 
VRC 601 ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) was the first study of the VRC01 mAb in H IV-infected  participants (31). It was 
a dose -escalation study to examine safety, tolerability,  dose, PK, and anti - antibody immune responses. 
VRC 601 opened in September 2013 as a single site study at the NIH Clinical Center, Bethesda, 
Maryland and in  total, 23 HIV -infected participants, including 15 aviremic ARV -treated  participants and 
8 viremic non -ARV treated participants, were infused with one or two doses of VRC01 at doses up to 40 
mg/kg IV.  
 
All IV infusions and SC injections were well tolerated with no serious adverse events (SAEs) or dose 
limiting toxicity  (DLT) . VRC [ADDRESS_374009] on HIV viral load when administered as a single 40 mg/kg IV dose 
(Figure 1; (31)). None of 
these adults were taking 
ART when enrolled into the 
study and had not started 
ART during the time period 
when the viral load data 
were collected. Six of the 
eight adult participants had 
≥1 log 10 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL  decrease 
in viral load and two 
participants  had a viral load

 These interim data indicate the following for a single  dose of VRC01 at 40 mg/kg IV: a statistically 
significant decline in viral load after infusion at days 5 to 16; a median time of 5 days to reach ≥ 0.5 
log 10 decrease in viral load; and a median time of [ADDRESS_374011]  
infusion.  
 
In VRC 601, participants were administered a single dose of 
VRC01 at 40 mg/kg and, therefore, a sustained effect on 
viral load was not expected. However, data  demonstrate d 
an anti-viral effect and led to the hypothesis that  repetitive 
VRCO1 dosing could have a beneficial clinical effect. This 
hypothesis was  tested in two clinical trials, AIDS Clinical 
Trials Group (ACTG) A5340 and NIH 15 -I-0140, in which ART 
suppressed  participants  underwent an analytical treatment 
interruption ( ATI) after receiving VRC01  40 mg/kg (32). No 
product -related safety concerns were identified in the  24 
participants enrolled. Viral rebound occurred despi[INVESTIGATOR_305599]01 
serum  concentrations well above 50 mcg/mL with a mean 
time to rebound of 4 to 6 weeks  (32). While the mean time 
to rebound was statistically significantly different from 
historical controls in previous ACTG ATI studies at 4 weeks, 
there  was no difference at 8 weeks. VRC01 was also found 
to exert selection pressure on emergent viruses ( Figure 2 , 
(32)). 
 
VRC 602 
VRC 602 was a dose -escalation study of the VRC01 mAb in HIV -uninfected adults to examine safety, 
tolerability, dose,  and PK of VRC01 (1) . There were [ADDRESS_374012] infusion, 28 -day 
trough levels were 35 m cg/mL and 57 mcg/mL for the 20 mg/kg and 40 mg/kg dose groups, 
respectively. Following the second infusion, the 28 -day trough values rose to 57 mcg/mL and 89 
mcg/mL for the 20 mg/kg and 40 mg/kg dose groups, respectively. In addition, post  infusion VRC01 
retained the  expected neutralizing activity in serum and no anti -VRC01 antibodies were  detected  (1). 
 
HVTN 104  
HVTN 104 was a phase 1 clinical trial designed to evaluate the safety and drug levels of VRC01 
administered in multiple IV or SC doses and different dosing  schedules to 88 healthy, HIV -uninfected 
adults at six  HIV Vaccine Trials Network ( HVTN ) CRSs in four  US cities:  [LOCATION_011], [LOCATION_001], Philadelphia, 
and Cleveland. The first participant enrolled in  HVTN [ADDRESS_374013] 
administration for all  participants was complete as of November 30, 2015. The study had 5 arms: 
Group 1 evaluated the IV administration of a 40 mg/kg loading dose, with 2 subsequent 20 mg/kg 
doses given at 8 week intervals. Groups 2, 4, and 5 evaluated 3 infusions of 40 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg, or 30 
mg/kg, respectively, given 8 weeks apart. Group 3 evaluated 5 mg/kg given every 2 weeks 
subcutaneously for 24 weeks after an initial IV administration at 40 mg/kg in orde r to inform the  
design of perinatal prophylaxis studies.

 A total of 249 IV infusions and 208 SC injections of VRC01 were administered in  HVTN 104. The 
infusions and injections were well tolerated, with 28% of infusions and 14% of injections associated 
with mild pain and/or tenderness. 55% of VRC01 and 50% of placebo recipi[INVESTIGATOR_305600]/or tenderness at the infusion or injection site sometime during the trial. One participant  
experienced moderate pain and/or tenderness following an SC in jection of VRC01. Mild infusion site 
erythema/induration reactions were reported for 2 VRC01 participants and 1 placebo recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]. Two 
moderate erythema/induration reactions were reported, 1 following IV VRC01 and 1 following VRC01 
SC injection. For 76% of  the infusions and injections administered in the trial, no systemic 
reactogenicity symptoms were reported. 56% of VRC01 and 75% of placebo recipi[INVESTIGATOR_305601]. These w ere all 
graded as mild in the  placebo recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. Among VRC01 recipi[INVESTIGATOR_305602] , the 
maximum severity was mild in 70%, moderate in 23%, and severe  in 6% (3 participants). The most 
commonly reported symptoms were  malaise/fatigue (30%), he adaches (32%), and myalgias (26%).  
 
The severe systemic reactogenicity symptoms reported in 3 VRC01 recipi[INVESTIGATOR_305603] 104 are detailed 
as follows:  
 One participant developed severe malaise, myalgia, headache and chills, mild nausea, and 
moderate arthralgia symptoms within [ADDRESS_374014]. The 
participant had a concomitant AE of laboratory confirmed influenza A infection diagnosed on Day 
2 treated with ibuprofen. Symptoms resolved by [CONTACT_2006] 7.   
 One participant reported a viral illness adverse event ( AE) of moderate intensity beginning 3 days 
prior to the  9th SC injection (10th study product administration), characterized by [CONTACT_305662], sore throat, runny nose but no fevers; a  household contact [CONTACT_269896]. At baseline on 
Day 0 of the 9th SC injection, mild malaise/fatigue was still present. At the early assessment time  
point on  Day 0, mild malaise/fatigue was still present and was accompanied by [CONTACT_479] 1  nausea. 
Within 3 days o f the injection, the participant developed severe  malaise, myalgia, headache, chills, 
and arthralgia; these all resolved on Day 6,  which was the date the AE for viral illness resolved. 
There was no reported use of concomitant medications for these symptoms . 
 One participant reported severe malaise/fatigue on the day of the first  infusion, resolving 
spontaneously the next day. During this reactogenicity period, this participant also reported a 
grade [ADDRESS_374015] discontinuations due to reactogenicity symptoms. There were 235 AEs 
occurring in 70 participants (79.5%), with similar rates of occurrence across all treatment groups (81% 
among VRC01 recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]; 75% in  placebo recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]). 74% of AEs were g raded as mild, 22.5% as 
moderate, and 3.4% as severe. Only 9 AEs (3.8% of all AEs) occurring in [ADDRESS_374016] -related by [CONTACT_473]; all were mild and transient. Those occurring following VRC01 
administration included elevations  of hepatic  transaminases (aspartate aminotransferase [AST] and 
alanine aminotransferase [ALT] in 1 individual), elevated creatinine, neutropenia, localized injection 
site pruritus, diarrhea, generalized rash, and Varicella zoster infection. No VRC01 - related 
hypersensitivity reactions or Cytokine Release Syndrome symptoms were  observed during the study. 
Study product administration was discontinued in [ADDRESS_374017] included: AEs (3 participants), relocation from s tudy site (2), unable to adhere to visit 
schedule (1), unable to  contact (1), and pregnancy (1).  
 
 
 
 
The VOR -07 Study  Version 4.0

Brochure  (IB), version 4.0, February 26, 2018).  
 
VRC01 SC or IV administrations are generally associated with mild or moderate  local reactions of 
pruritus, redness, and pain/tenderness, which resolve within a  few minutes to a few hours  after the 
administration is completed. When present,  most systemic reactions after administration of VRC01 SC or 
IV are mild and  include: malaise, myalgia, headache, chills, nausea, and joint pain. Unsolicited AEs of 
grade [ADDRESS_374019] elevation, ALT 
elevation, creatinine elevation, and decreased neutrophil count. Mild or moderate elevated 
transaminases were reported in 4 of 21 (19%) HIV -infected participants in VRC 601 (all of whom were 
taking ARVs). These laboratory changes resolved spontaneously and did not require  discontinuation of 
study product administration. Among HIV -uninfected  participants in VRC 602 or HVTN 104, 1 participant 
had grade 1 (mild) transiently elevated ALT assessed as possibly attributed to VRC01 in the VRC 602 
study and 2 participants had grade 1 (mild) transiently elevated ALT/AST  values assessed as related to 
VRC01 i n HVTN 104. These [ADDRESS_374020], nor observed increases in frequency or 
severity of local o r systemic reactogenicity symptoms  with multiple administrations of VRC01 in these 
trials.   
 
The ongoing efficacy trials (HVTN 704/HPTN 085 and HVTN 703/HPTN 081) have accumulated significant 
additional VRC01 clinical experience; but these trials remain blinded and, thus, do not yet contribute to 
the unblinded VRC01 safety profile. However, in the ongoing blinded phase of these trials, urticaria or 
similar reactions have been reported at an overall frequency of about 1%. These reactions have been 
treated by [CONTACT_13635][INVESTIGATOR_305604], including anti- histamine and steroid 
therapy, as indicated, and no serious health consequences have been reported. No participants who 
experienced  urticaria have been re -challenged  with VRC01 . Overall, VRC01 administration in the dose 
range from 10 to 40 mg/kg IV and at 5 mg/kg SC has been assessed as well- tolerated and safe for further 
evaluation.

 Clinical Studies of VRC01LS  
 
VRC 606 
VRC01LS began evaluation in the VRC 606 study in November 2015. VRC 606 is a dose -escalation study 
to examine safety, tolerability, dose, and pharmacokinetics of VRC01LS. There were 4 open -label, dose 
escalation groups  (Groups 1 -4) to  assess VRC01LS administered IV and SC once per participant and 2 
open -label  groups (Groups 5 and 6) to assess VRC01LS at 5 mg/kg SC or at 20 mg/kg IV administered 
every [ADDRESS_374021] administration, serum 
concentrations of VRC01LS were approximately 5 -fold higher than corresponding levels of VRC01. The 
half- life of VRC01LS in healthy HIV -uninfected adults was also approximately 4 -fold longer than VRC01  
with the  maximal concentrati on observed  1-5 ho urs following IV administration (33). 
 
The safety and PK data for the first [ADDRESS_374022] been 
published in 2018  (33). In summary, VRC01LS has been generally well tolerated when delivered IV or SC 
and there were no SAEs  or dose -limiting toxicity (Investigator’s Brochure, version 4.0, February 26, 
2018).  
The solicited local and systemic signs and symptoms following administration of VRC01LS were m ild or 
moderate for local and systemic reactogenicity . Mild malaise and myalgia were the most common 
solicited AEs reported by [ADDRESS_374023] frequent local reaction was 
pain/tenderness at injection site reported by 14 participants, but which occurred in only  2 participants 
by [CONTACT_3433] e IV route and which were mild in both cases; the remainder occurred with SC administration). No 
systemic symptoms were reported during product administration.  
Six AEs were assessed as possibly related to VRC01LS administration and all were mild in severity. Only 
one of the treatment- related AEs occurred in one participant receiving VRC01LS via the IV route and 
included diarrhea ( in the 5 mg/kg, IV  group ) and which resolved the same day. The remainder of the AEs 
possibly related to VRC01LS SC administratio n included diarrhea on the day of administration and which 
resolved the same day, lightheadedness on the day following administration and symptoms resolved 
within [ADDRESS_374024] administration and elevated 
aminotransferase levels (56 and 69 IU/L) on D ay [ADDRESS_374025] injection and which both resolved within 15 
days of onset. No volunteer had a positive HIV enzyme immunoassay (EIA) response during the study.  
VRC 607 
Evaluation of VRC01LS in HIV -infected adults in t he VRC 607 study was initiated in April 2017. As of 
01/17/2018, [ADDRESS_374026] been enrolled and received VRC01LS at 40 mg/kg IV. No local or 
systemic reactogenicity were reported during VRC01LS administrations in VRC 607. None of the  [ADDRESS_374027] administration. All other unsolicited AEs were Grade 1 (mild) or Grade 2 (moderate) and 
assessed as unrelated to study product.  
HVTN 116  
An additional study of VRC01LS, HVTN 116 [[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]], is currently recruiting with  19 of 101 
participants enrolled as of July 31, 2017. Serum VRC01LS concentrations as high as 20 mcg/mL were 
observed in VRC  606 at 165 days (approximately 24 weeks) after a 5 mg/kg IV infusion and were, on 
average, over 65 mcg/mL at 165 days after a 20 mg /kg IV infusion ( Figure 3).

 VRC01LS concentration on Day 84 after a single 5mg/kg SC  administration was, on average, over 10 
times greater than VRC01 concentration on Day 84 after a single 5mg/kg SC VRC01 administration. 
VRC01LS concentrations were over 40 times higher than  those of VRC01 when comparing VRC01 
concentrations on Day 84 after a  single 20 mg/kg IV infusion to VRC01LS concentrations on Day 84 after 
a single  20 mg/kg IV infusion.   
Overall, VRC01LS administration in the dose range from 1 to 40 m g/kg IV and at  5 mg/kg SC have been 
assessed as well -tolerated and safe for further evaluation.

VRC 605 
A phase 1 , open -label, dose -escalation study of VRC07 -523LS, VRC 605 ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]), is 
underway in healthy, HIV -uninfected adults to evaluate the  safety and pharmacokinetics of 1 to 3 
administrations of the antibody. The doses being evaluated are a sin gle administration of 1 mg/kg 
and 5 mg/kg IV and SC, and 20 mg/kg and 40 mg/kg IV, and three administrations (q 12 weeks) of 5 
mg/kg SC and 20 mg/kg IV VRC07 -523LS. Study objectives include evaluating the safety and 
tolerability of the study regimen and th e pharmacokinetics of each dose level; determining the 
presence or absence of detectable ADA to VRC07 -523LS; and evaluating for evidence of functional 
activity of VRC07 -523LS.

 administrations were discontinued for this participant 
due to the concomitant illness. While the participant 
was followed for safety, her liver enzymes decreased, 
but then increased again after start ing on citalopram,

completion of the infusion. The participant was treated 
with acetaminophen a nd ibuprofen. All symptoms 
resolved within 12 hours. A separate participant in the 
20 mg/kg IV group experienced  3 separate  infusion 
reactions (n = 2 moderate, n = 1 mild) after each 
product infusion. The participant experienced nausea, 
chills, rigors, malaise, tachycardia, headache, myalgia 
(mostly back), and arthralgia (mostly hips and knees). 
Symptoms began [ADDRESS_374031] been generally well tolerated  with no unexpected reactions . For 
solicited local reactions in the week after VRC07 -523LS administrations, one of 17 participants (5.9%) 
who received the product b y IV administration reported mild bruising at administration site. For 
solicited systemic adverse events reported [ADDRESS_374032] administration, 4 of 17 participants 
(25%) receiving VRC07 -523LS IV reported mild or moderate systemic reactogenicity sym ptoms. The 
reported symptoms were malaise (n = 2 mild, n=1 moderate), myalgia (n = 2 mild, n = 1 moderate), mild 
headache (n = 2), and moderate chills (n = 2). Five of 8 participants (62.5%) receiving VRC07 -523LS SC 
reported mild systemic reactogenicity sy mptoms: malaise (n = 3), myalgia (n = 2), headache (n = 3), chills 
(n = 1), nausea (n = 1), and joint pain (n = 2).   
 
As of February 15, 2018, preliminary interim PK results are insufficient to determine the clearance rate

 estimated to be 33 ± 10 days.  The 28 day trough following one dose of VRC07 -523LS 40 mg/kg IV was 
272 (53 mcg/mL) (n=3) (IB, version 4.0, February 26, 2018).  
 
Vorinostat  (VOR)  
VOR i s a potent inhibitor of HDAC activity and binds directly to the catalytic pocket of HDAC enzymes. 
VOR, at low nanomolar concentrations, inhibits the enzymatic activity of HDAC1, HDAC2, and HDAC3 
(Class I) and HDAC6 (Class II) (34 -36). Concentrations of VOR that cause the accumulat ion of acetylated 
histones also induce cell cycle arrest, differentiation, or apoptosis of transformed cells (35) . VOR induces 
apoptosis in a wide variety of transformed cells in culture, including cutaneous T -cell lymphoma (CTCL) 
cell lines, circulating atypi[INVESTIGATOR_2855] T -cells derived from patients with CTCL, human lymphoma cell lines and 
murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells. VOR also inhibits proliferation of cultured transformed human cells 
derived from leukemias, non -small cell lung carcinomas, colon carcinomas, central nervous system 
tumors, melanomas, ovarian carcinomas, renal cell carcinomas, prostate and breast cancers. In cultured 
human transformed cell lines, VOR has synergistic or additive activity in combination with other cancer 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], including radiation, kinase inhibitors, cytotoxic agents, and differentiating agents  (34, 35, 37-
44). In vivo, VOR demonstrates anti -neoplastic activity in a variety of rodent tumor models including 
xenograft models of human prostate, breast, and colon carcinoma. While it has been assumed that the 
effects of VOR on histone acetylation underpin its biological activities, a number of other proteins are 
regulated by [CONTACT_188757] (HATs) and HDACs and may be targeted by [CONTACT_305664] (45) . Several 
non-histone proteins, (e.g., tubulin, Hsp90, and p53) are known to be reversibly acetylated on lysine 
residues and undergo hyperacetylation following exposure to VOR (46 -48). Acetylation of these proteins 
may also contribute to the antitumor activity of VOR. Please refer to the VOR Clinical Investigator’s 
Brochure (CIB), edition 8, 8/1/2013, for detailed information.  
 
VOR and HIV  
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved Vorinostat (VOR) for the treatment of cutaneous 
manifestations in patients with cutaneous T -cell lymphoma who have progressive, persistent, or 
recurrent disease on or following two systemic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Due  to its potency as an HDAC inhibitor, its 
effect on HIV infection within resting CD4+ T cells might be more profound than VPA. The effect of VOR 
was compared to VPA in J89, a Jurkat T cell line infected with a single HIV genome encoding the 
enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) within the HIV genome. Histone acetylation at nucleosome 
1 of the HIV promoter was assayed by [CONTACT_305665][INVESTIGATOR_332]. EGFP mRNA expression was 
monitored by [CONTACT_305666], and p24 antigen production by [CONTACT_6428]. Bo th VPA and VOR 
induced chromatin remodeling at nucleosome 1, HIV transcription, and virus production in the J89 cell 
line (49). Limiting -dilution outgrowth assays compared the ability of VOR,  VPA, and maximal mitogen 
stimulation to induce virus expression from the resting CD4+ T cells obtained at four occasions from 
three aviremic, cART -treated HIV -infected participants. HIV p24 capsid antigen was measured by [CONTACT_6428], 
and infectious units per bi llion (IUPB) calculated by a maximum likelihood method. Comparable and 
clinically relevant concentrations of both compounds also induced virus outgrowth ex vivo from 
participants’ cells at similar frequencies.  
 
Nonclinical Pharmacology of VOR  
VOR is approx imately 71% bound to human plasma proteins over the range of concentrations 0.5 to 50 
μg/mL. VOR has a low propensity to cause or be affected by [CONTACT_9934] -drug interactions. In animal models 
and in vitro human systems, the major pathways of metabolism of VOR in volve glucuronidation and 
hydrolysis followed by β -oxidation. Additionally, the glucuronidation of VOR is mediated by [CONTACT_305667] (UGTs), making it less susceptible to drug 
interactions through modulation o f UGTs. VOR is not recovered intact in urine to any appreciable extent. 
The VOR -07 Study  Version 4.0  
Protocol: IGHID [ADDRESS_374033] the 
pharmacokinetics of VOR. VOR is not an inhibitor of CYP drug metabolizing enzymes in human liver 
microsomes at steady state Cmax of the 400 mg dose (Cmax of 1.2 μM vs. IC50 of >75 μM). Gene 
expression studies in human hepatocytes detected some potential for suppression of CYP2C9 and 
CYP3A4 activities by [CONTACT_305668] (≥ 10 μM) than pharm acologically relevant. Thus, VOR 
is not expected to affect the pharmacokinetics of other agents metabolized by [CONTACT_166113]. As VOR is 
not eliminated via the CYP pathways, it is anticipated that VOR will not be subject to drug -drug 
interactions when co -admi nistered with drugs that are known CYP inhibitors or inducers. However, no 
formal clinical studies have been conducted to evaluate drug interactions with VOR.  
 
Nonclinical Toxicology of VOR  
VOR has been investigated in nonclinical acute and oral repeated -dose toxicity studies, reproductive, 
developmental toxicity studies, and genetic toxicity studies to support oral administrat ion of this 
compound to humans. The main toxicities observed in animal models were we ight loss and loss of 
appetite, apparent hemolytic anemia (rats only at 3.8 times the equivalent 400 mg human  leukope nia 
(rats only at 1.3 times the  equivalent 400 mg human dose), thrombocytopenia (male rats only, 
statistically significant change at 0.5 times the  equivalent 400 mg clini cally effe ctive human dose, but 
within normal range at all doses), and gastrointestinal tract irritation (dogs only, at 8.5 times the 
equivalent 400 mg human dose). Although statistically significant and dose -dependent, many of the 
clinical pathology findings were w ithin normal histori cal ranges indicating that they should not have 
major toxicological consequences . The toxicities appeared to be rapi[INVESTIGATOR_188732] 12 to 14 days. 
There has been no evidence of cardiac toxicity based on electrocardiogram (ECG, dog s only), blood 
pressure (dogs only), heart rate (dogs only), creatinine kinase, organ weight, gross pathology, or 
histopathology assessments in studies up to one month duration. No serious, irreversible damage to any 
vital organ has been observed. Importan tly, t oxicities in rats and dogs were predictive of adverse effects 
in humans (anorexia, we ight loss, fatigue). Toxicities present in animals would be manageable in the 
clinic, and the onset of serious toxicity is readily forecasted by [CONTACT_188761]. T he nonclinical 
toxicity profile of VOR is acceptable for an oncology drug.  
 
Clinical Pharmacokinetics of VOR  
The pharmacokinetics of VOR following 400 mg sin gle-dose in a fasted state; and 400 mg single - and 
multiple -doses in a fed (high -fat m eal) state were evaluated in 23 participants in a Phase I study with 
relapsed or refractory advanced cancer using a validated assay. VOR is eliminated predominantly 1% of 
the dose recovered as unchanged drug in urine, indicating that renal excretion does n ot play a role in 
the elimination of VOR. Re covery of two pharmacologically inactive me tabolites, O glucuronide of VOR 
(OG-V) and 4 anilino -4 oxobutanoic acid (4A4OA),  in urine was more substantial. A population 
pharmacokinetic model using nonlin ear mixed effects (NONMEM, ICON plc) demonstrated that a first 
order, transit -compartment absorption and linear elimination best described VOR concentration data . 
The structural model was: (1) dXa/dt = -Ka x Xa, (2) dXb/dt = Ka x Xa –  Kt x Xb, (3)  dXc = Kt x Xb –  (CLt/Vc 
x Xc). Fixed effects: CLt (731 L/h), Vc (5.21 L), Ka (1.35 1/h) , Kt (0.7 1/h). Random effects: CLt (26% CV), 
Vc (76.8%), Ka (73%). Residual erro r was: 0.0001 ng/mL (additive), 73.6% (proportional). An exponential 
model was used fo r inter- individual variability; and a heteroscedas tic model was used for residual 
variability. Weight (power model, Vctyp=Vcwt x Weight (kg)θ, θ=1.17) was found to be a significant 
covariate on Vc.  
 
In pre -clinical studies, we and others found that VOR , already licensed for use in patients with cancer, 
induces HIV chromatin acetylation and promoter expression in cell lines, and virus production ex vivo  
from the resting CD4+ T cells of HIV -infected participants on suppre ssive ART (49, 50) . This effect was 
The VOR -07 Study  Version 4.0  
Protocol: IGHID [ADDRESS_374034] proof- of-concept of latency 
reversal (29). In subsequent work, our group demonstrated that serial VOR doses for up to 4 weeks were 
well- tolerated and that a dosing interval of 72 hours resulted in a significant increase in in rca- HIV RNA 
levels within circulating resting CD4+ T cells (51).  
 
Summary of Clinical Experience with VOR  
VOR has been studied in [COMPANY_006] Researc h Labs (MRL) sponsored studies, Investigator Initiated Study 
Protocols (IISP) and National Cancer Institute (NCI) sponsored studies. V OR has been orally administered 
in Phase I, Phase II, and Phase III clinical studies in participants  with advanced solid t umors and 
hematologic malignancies. VOR has been studied both alon e and in combination with other 
chemotherapy agents. As of [ADDRESS_374035] found VRC-523LS and similar mAbs as well as  VOR to be safe and well -tolerated. 
Based on our prior work to define  optimized VOR dosing intervals and pharmacokinetic data for 
VRC01LS  in humans , the propose d study design will provide antibody exposure over the approximate 
four  week period of latency reversal by [CONTACT_305664] .  We propose to evaluate the safety of combining VRC523 -
LS 40 mg/kg infusion followed by [CONTACT_305669] -1. 
 
2.3 RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSM ENT   
 
2.3.[ADDRESS_374036] 
been no SAEs or Grade 3 or higher AEs. Two participants developed infusion reactions shortly after 
VRC01 -523LS administration by [CONTACT_24636], with symptoms typi[INVESTIGATOR_305607].  
 
In addition, the similar CD4 -binding site mAb VRC01 has been given to over 2 600 participants in several 
phase 1 and phase 2 clinical trials. More than 8,000 infusions of 10 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg VRC01 have 
been give n to HIV -uninfected adults in HVTN 704/HPTN 085 and HVTN 703/HPTN 081. Both VRC01 and 
VRC01LS are being tested in an ongoing phase 1 study (HVTN 116).  
 
Standard infusion reactions to mAb administration are typi[INVESTIGATOR_305608], flushing, 
chills, rigors, nausea, vomiting, pain, headache, dizziness, shortness of breath, hypertension, pruritus, 
rash, urticaria, diarrhea, tachycardia, or chest pain (52). Most infusion reactions appear to result from 
antibody -antigen interactions resulting in cytokine release (52) . Administration of m Abs may have a risk 
of severe reactions, such as acute anaphylaxis, serum sickness, angioedema, bronchospasm, 
hypotension, and hypoxia, the generation of anti -drug antibodies; they may also be associated with an 
increased risk of infections. However, these  reactions are rare and more often associated with mAbs  
targeted to human proteins (52)  or with the use of murine mAbs, which have a risk of eliciting human 
anti-mouse antibodies (53). Infusion of mAbs directed against cell surface targets on lymphocytes may

 cause a reaction known as “cytokine release syndrome,” with clinical manifestations including fatigue, 
headache, urticaria, pruritus, bronchospasm, dyspnea, sensation of tongue or throat swelling, rhinitis, 
nausea, vomiting, flushing, fever, chills, hypotension , tachycardia, and asthenia (54) . Cases of cytokine 
release syndrom e occur most often in the first few hours after the first mAb dose, because the cytokine 
release is associated with lysis of the cells targeted by [CONTACT_305670] (54) . 
 
Since VRC07 -523LS targets a viral antigen rather than human cell surface antigens and is a human mAb, 
severe infusion reactions are expected to be rare. Most infusion -related events occur within the first 24 
hours after beginning administration.  
 
1. Mild Reaction to m Ab Administration:  
 
Standard infusion reactions can occur and most appear to result from antibody -antigen 
interactions resulting in cytokine release  (53, 54) .  These reactions include:  
 
• fever   pain  
• flushing   headaches  
• chills   dizziness  
• rigors   tachycardia  
• nausea   chest pain  
• vomiting   
 
2. Severe Reaction mAb Administration:  
 
These reactions are rare and more often associated with mAbs targeted to human proteins or 
with the use of murine mAbs, which have a risk of eliciting human anti- mouse antibodies ( 42) 
and include:  
a) acute anaphylaxis  
b) serum sickness  –this type of reaction is usually delayed and these symptoms are may 
not appear until several days after the exposure to the mAb. This type of reaction is 
more  common with chimeric types of mAb ( 43). 
a. Symptoms include urticaria, fever, lymph node enlargement, and joint pains. 
These symptoms may not appear until several days after the exposure to the 
mAb and are noted to be more common with chimeric types of mAb ( 43). 
c) angioedema  
d) bronchosp asm  
e) hypotension   
f) hypoxia   
g) the generation of anti -drug antibodies  (ADA)  
h) increased risk of infections  
 
3. Cytokine Release Syndrome  
 
These symptoms occur most often in the first few hours after the first mAb dose, because the 
cytokine  release is associated with lysis of the cells targeted by [CONTACT_305671] (54).

4. Reactions related to the rate of infusion : 
 
These reactions  have been described for several FDA - licensed mAbs. With licensed therapeutic 
mAbs, cytokine -mediated infusion reactions, including cytokine release syndrome, are typi[INVESTIGATOR_305609], administering histamine blockers , and restarting 
the infusion at a slower rate  (55). Supportive treatment may also be indicated for some signs 
and symptoms.  
 
To date, the clinical trial safety experience with VRC01 -class mAbs has been reassuring.  
a) In HVTN 104, IV administration of VRC01  was generally well- tolerated with mild pain 
and/or tenderness commonly reported at the site of the IV infusion. Mild to moderate 
systemic reactogenicity symptoms were reported by [CONTACT_33805]01 recipi[INVESTIGATOR_305610], but there was no c lear relationship with frequency or severity to 
the dose of VRC01  (56). 
b) No hypersensitivity reactions or cytokin e release syndrome symptoms were reported in 
HVTN 104  (56). 
c) The ongoing blinded HVTN 704/HPTN 085 an d HVTN 703/HPTN [ADDRESS_374037] reported 
an approximately 1% rate of urticaria or similar reactions.  
d) In the ongoing VRC [ADDRESS_374038] been no SAEs and no safety 
pauses.  
e) Severe reactions associated with mAb administration, such as ac ute anaphylaxis, serum 
sickness, anti -drug antibodies, and increased risk of infections have not been observed 
to date in trials of VRC01 -class mAbs.  
 
Risks Associated with Vorinostat  
1. Reaction to VOR administration : 
The three major clinical categories of adverse experiences attributable to VOR include a 
constellation of gastrointestinal symptoms, constitutional complaints, and cytopenias. Most of 
the adverse experiences were manageable. In fact, most of the very commo n adverse 
experiences were reversible and could be managed using conventional supportive care for 
chemotherapy. On the whole, treatment with oral VOR was well tolerated for use in the 
outpatient oncology setting.  
 
Adverse experiences considered by [CONTACT_305672] 
≥10 % of participants across all [COMPANY_006] & Co., Inc. sponsored VOR clinical studies include (in 
descending frequency): nausea, fatigue, diarrhea, anorexia, vomiting, thrombocytopenia, 
The VOR -07 Study  Version 4.0  
Protocol: IGHID [ADDRESS_374039] of VOR on latent HIV virus. Other research institutions (both in the 
U.S. and internationally) also used the drug for this purpose. In UNC  studies, approximately [ADDRESS_374040] seen very few side 
effects, and none of the side effects or abnormal labs observed were significant or required 
medical attention.  
 
Participants are permitted to receive appropriate support ive care measures as considered 
appropriate by [CONTACT_1016] (or designee) including:  
a) Diarrhea:  Diarrhea should be treated promptly with appropriate supportive care per 
guidelines. Supportive care should begin at the first sign of poorly formed or loose sto ol, 
occurrence of more bowel movements than usual in one day or unusually high volume 
of stool. Supportive care should be deferred if blood or mucus is present in the stool or 
if diarrhea is accompanied by [CONTACT_411].  
b) Dehydration : Altered taste and decreased food and liquid intake are associated with 
VOR administration. Participants should also be advised to drink a lot of clear fluids (at 
least 2 liters/day) to help prevent dehydration . 
c) Nausea and Vomiting: Nausea and vomiting sh ould be managed according to standard 
practice.  
d) Anemia: Treatment with VOR can cause dose- related anemia that may result in fatigue, 
lethargy, or shortness of breath. If hemoglobin is reduced during treatment with VOR, 
the incident will be evaluated and th e dose will either be maintained or terminated in 
the case of toxicity.  
e) Thrombocytopenia: Treatment with VOR can cause dose- related thrombocytopenia. If 
platelet counts are reduced during treatment with VOR, this incident will be evaluated 
and dosing will either be maintained or terminated in the case of toxicity.  
f) Hyperglycemia has been observed. Serum glucose should be monitored. Adjustment of 
diet and/or therapy for increased glucose may be necessary.  
g) Hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia should be corrected prio r to administration of VOR, 
and monitoring potassium and magnesium in symptomatic participants (e.g., 
participants with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fluid imbalance, or cardiac symptoms.)  
h) Unknown effects, such as detectable HIV RNA (viral load) and other factors related to 
HIV infection, with this participant population, since there is limited data on the use of 
VOR in this particular population.  
 
2. Overdose  
We include this section for completeness. A person who takes any dose of VOR more than 
prescribed will be considered to have taken an overdose. Specific information is not available on 
the treatment of an overdose. There are no not ed adverse experiences reported when a person 
took an overdose of VOR. No specific antidote has been identified for an overdose of VOR.  
 
Participants should be advised not to make up missed doses. If a participant has an epi[INVESTIGATOR_305611], the participant should be instructed not to take an additional dose. If a  
The VOR -07 Study  Version 4.0  
Protocol: IGHID [ZIP_CODE] 09 May 2019 
30 
 participant on this study takes more than the prescri bed dose of VOR, he/she will be observed  
closely for signs of toxicity. Supportive treatment will be provided, as clinically indicated.  
 
3. Pregnancy  
No human safety data for the use of Vorinostat during pregnancy are available.  Vorinostat has 
been assigned to pregnancy category D by [CONTACT_305673] a study in animals which found that 
Vorinostat crosses the placenta and may harm the developi[INVESTIGATOR_16103].  
 
Risks Associated with Leukapheresis  
These include common side effects due to blood drawing. However, more serious side effects could 
occur such as flushing, infection due to contaminated equipment , and damage to red blood cells. These 
serious side effects occur in less than [ADDRESS_374041] common:  
a) Pain or bruising at the site of needle sticks  
b) Phlebitis - Formation of a blood clot at the blood draw site  
c) Citrate toxicity (10%)  
a. Oral paresthesia (tingling around the mouth)   
b. Paresthesia (tingling/crampi[INVESTIGATOR_305612], fingertips, and feet)  
d) Stiffness in the arms due to the immobilization during donation  
e) Fatigue  or tiredness  
f) Fluctuations in blood pressure or heart rate  
 
Less common:  
a) Infiltration – the needle dislodges and comes out of the vein causing the fluid to go into the 
tissue,  
b) Muscle aches or cramps  
c) Chills  
d) Fever  
e) Nausea or vomiting  
f) Lightheadedness or headache  
g) Vasovagal reaction resulting in decrease in BP an d heart rate  
 
Rare:  
a) Seizures or fainting  
b) Transient weight gain, ankle swelling, or increased urination for 24 hours due to fluid retention  
c) Infection due to contamination of equipment  
d) Skin rashes, flushing, or other allergic responses  
e) Damage to or loss of red blood cells due to machine malfunction  
f) Possibility of air entering the vein and causing chest pains, shortness of breath , or shock or 
death  
 
Risks of Blood Drawing   
Blood drawing may cause pain , and bruising and may infrequently cause a feeling of lightheadedness or 
fainting. Rarely, it may cause infection at the site where the blood is taken. Problems from use of an IV 
for blood drawing are generally mild and may include pain, bruising, minor sw elling  or bleeding at the IV

 site, and rarely, infection, vein irritation (called phlebitis), or blood clot. Risk will be minimized by [CONTACT_305674].  
 
Risks of Intravenous Infusion  
Problems from use of an IV are generally mild and may include pain, bruising, minor swelling or bleeding 
at the IV site , and rarely, infection, vein irritation (called phlebitis), or blood clot. Risk will be minimized 
by [CONTACT_305675].  
 
The placement of an in travenous catheter can allow for the development of bacteremia because of th e 
contact [CONTACT_305676]. This will be prevented through 
careful decontamination of local skin prior to catheter placement and through the use of infection 
control practices during infusion. Product contamination will be prevented by [CONTACT_305677].

2.3.2 KNOWN POTENTIAL BENE FITS  
 
The addition of VOR and VRC07 -523LS to a person’s ART regimen or the donation of one’s blood cells to 
this research study  provide s no direct medical benefits to participants. However, participation 
contributes to ongoing HIV research, potentially resulting in new treatments for HIV infection.

benefit for their participation in this study, there remains a strong desire among HIV -infected 
individuals, and the HIV community at -large, to pursue HIV cure and remission strategies. The potential 
adverse effects, stigmatization , and financial costs encountered by [CONTACT_10840] -infected persons receiving life -
long antiretroviral therapy along with the potential harm of persistent immune activation/inflammation 
are strong reasons to pursue HIV cure and remission research. In short, an HIV cure or sustained

Step  4.  
 
Safety data will include local and systemic 
signs and symptoms, laboratory 
measures of safety/toxicity, and all AEs  
and SAEs . Safety data will be rou tinely 
collected throughout the duration o f the 
study.  
  
The study will use s tandard 
safety grades used in HIV 
clinical trials. Should these 
grades be exceeded, it is 
currently felt that such 
risks would be 
unacceptable in a research 
study of this nature.

4 STUDY DESIGN  
 
4.1 OVERALL  DESIGN  
 
This is a phase I, single -site study to evaluate the effects of VOR given in combination with  VRC07 -523LS 
on persistent HIV -1 Infection in HIV -infected individual s suppressed on ART.  
 
We hypothesize that combination therapy with VRC07 -523LS and VOR will be safe and well- tolerated by 
[CONTACT_10840]-1-infected participants suppressed on ART.  
 
This study will also explore the ability of a novel clearance modality (VRC07 -523LS ) to reduce the 
frequency of latent, resting CD4+ T cell infection when combined with a latency reversal agent (VOR) . 
 
The VOR -07 Study  Version 4.0  
Protocol: IGHID [ZIP_CODE] 09 May 2019 
34 
 This study will enroll up to twelve evaluable participants with durable viral suppression  to complete all 4 
Steps.   We estimate that it will take approximately 8 months to complete enrollment .  
 
All eligible participants will receive th e same treatment. Each participant will receive  a total of two (2) 
infusions of VRC07 -523LS at 40mg/kg/dose and twenty ( 20) PO doses of VOR  400 mg . Participants will 
continue their baseline ART regimen throughout the study.  
 
4.2 SCIENTIFIC R ATIONALE FOR S TUDY DESIGN  
 
This is an open label, non -randomized study to validate the safety of VRC07 -523LS when given with 
Vorinostat. For scientific aims, assays are performed before and after intervention.   
 
4.3 JUSTIFICATION FOR DO SE 
 
The dose of VOR (400 mg every (q) 72 hou rs) has been validated  (51). The dose of VRC07 -523LS has 
been validated at 40 mg/kg in study VRC 605 ( see above).  
 
The VRC07 -523LS dose and timing of administration with combination with VOR is based on human 
studies of VRC01, preclinical and clinical studies of VRC01LS, preclinical and clinical studies of VRC07 -
523LS , and PK data for VOR in humans.  PK results following VRC07 -523LS infusion of 40mg/kg (the dose 
proposed in this protocol) are shown in Figure 4 (above) , showing serum concentrations >10 mcg/mL 
beyond  30 days which encompasses the duration of VOR dosing on the study . 
 
In addition,  serum concentrations  of VRC07 -523LS are  comparable to VRC01 40mg/kg IV and VRC01LS 
40mg/kg IV. Additional  interim PK results for VRC07 -523LS 5 mg/kg dose by [CONTACT_305678]01LS are shown in Figure 5 (above) .  Panel A of Figure 5 shows serum concentrations >10 mcg/mL 
through day [ADDRESS_374045] visit shown in the S chedule of Events in  Section 1.3 .

5.5 STRATEGIES FOR RECRU ITMENT AND RETENTION  
 
Recruitment venues -  There are several venues for recruitment available to the study team:  
 
1. In the UNC ID Clinic and/or other local HIV clinics, there is a large pool of patients with long -term 
viral suppression on ART interested in participating in research.  Many have previously 
participated in clin ical studies. These individuals will be provided with the opportunity to discuss 
this study with their provider and the study coordinator.  
 
2. Individuals who signed the UNC CFAR database consent, as well as those who signed the 
consent for the UNC Cure and PHI studies/database, will be identified and approached about 
the study. Primary care providers or the study coordinator, after consultation with their primary 
care provider, will provide information about the study and participation.  
 
3. Individuals interes ted in participating in the study  will be provided with appropriate study 
information and the opportunity to screen. All potential participants will be informed that :  
b) On rare occasions some of the serious side effects described in this protocol as well as 
other unpredicted adverse events can occur.  
c) Their participation in this study will allow researchers the opportunity to collect valuable 
information about the use of V RC07 -523LS in individuals with durable viral suppression 
and its ability to improve immune responses.  
d) There will be no direct and immediate benefits to participants  in this study, but 
information learned from this study may be of value to the participant and other people 
with HIV disease.  
 
4. Targeted study demographics will be addressed . Recruitment for this study will largely be clinic -
based, but p articipant  advocacy groups will assist us, and local media may be used if needed. 
Our studies routinely enroll a representative sample of under -represented populations and 
women.  We will also use recruitment materials such as flyers, palm cards, and posters and use 
social media websites and employ a community engagement plan.

6.2.[ADDRESS_374069] STORAGE AND STABILITY  
 
Vorinostat :  
Vorinostat capsules should be stored at room temper ature (do not store above 30°C) in a dry, limited -
access area. Care should be taken to maintain acceptable storage temperature. Vorinostat capsules 
should not be opened or crushed and must be administered whole.  
 
VRC07 -523LS :  
VRC07 -523LS product label designates the long- term storage as - 35°C to -15°C ( -31°F to 5°F). Clinical site 
storage in a qualified, continuously monitored, temperature- controlled freezer with temperatures from 
-45°C to -10°C ( -49°F to 14°F) is acceptable.  
 
After thaw, VRC07 -523LS vials may be stored for up to 24 hours at room temperature (maximum 27°C). 
If vials are not used within that time, they may then be refrigerated for up to 14 days at 2 -8°C. If stored 
at 2-8°C, vials must be equilibrated at controlled room temperature (maximum 27°C) for a 
minimum of [ADDRESS_374070] be 
documented appropriat ely (i.e., witnessed) in accordance with applicable federal regulations, Good  
Clinical Practice (GCP) procedures, and the procedures for handling biohazardous substances.

 VRC07 -523LS   
In this trial, the dose is limited or established based on the participant’s weight. In calculating the dose 
to administer and the number of vials to thaw, it should be assumed that the concentration is 100 
mg/mL and that a volume of at least 6 mL can be w ithdrawn from a vial. Preparation of VRC07 -523LS for 
IV administration will require a 100 mL bag of 0.9% sodium chloride, USP (normal saline). Note that the 
normal saline bags referred to as “100 mL bags” in the IV administration instructions will typi[INVESTIGATOR_1306] y have 
[ADDRESS_374071] infusion (Day 0) , a new prescription will be sent to the IDS 
pharmacy. The prescription MUST contain the participant’s weight based upon the participant’s 
weight at Step 1 Visit 1.  
 
Any changes in weight of more than 10% (between the  weight  obtained at Step [ADDRESS_374072] infusion visit and 
the weight on the day of the 2nd infusion visit) will re quire a new prescription, which includes 
the new weight, and written so that product can be prepared based on that weight change.  
 
Pharmacists should keep in mind that the preparation instructions below are considered 
medium risk per USP 38 General Chapter Physical Tests / <797> Pharmaceutical Compounding -  
Sterile, and should follow the requirements of their country, their institutio n, and their 
pharmacy regulatory authority regarding these procedures.  
 
VRC07 -523LS is a highly concentrated protein solution and may develop white, opaque to 
translucent particles after thawing. When particles are observed, they may disappear after a few  
hours at room temperature or storage at 2°C to 8°C.  
 
Ensure that only the required vials are present in the preparation unit during dilution and that 
medication labels are strictly segregated to avoid mix -ups. 
 
2. Thawing  
 
a) Thaw vial(s) for a minimum of 1 ho ur at controlled room temperature (maximum 27°C) 
after removing from the freezer.  
 
Following thaw, unopened vials of VRC07 -523LS may be stored for up to 24 hours at 
controlled room temperature (maximum 27°C) and/or up to 2 weeks (14 days) at 2°C to 
8°C. 
 
b) Keep the material at room temperature during the entire preparation period until use, 
up to the maximum storage times described in section 6.2.3 .  
 
c) Prior to preparation for administration, vials should be swirled for 30 seconds with 
sufficient force to re -suspend any visible particles, yet avoiding foaming. DO NOT SHAKE 
THE VIALS. If particles are observed, return the vials to 2°C to 8°C storage. If the particles 
re-dissolve within the maximum storage times , described in section 6.2.3 for 2°C to 8°C 
The VOR -07 Study  Version 4.0  
Protocol: IGHID [ADDRESS_374073] be equilibrated at controlled room temperature (maximum 
27°C /80.6°F ) for a minimum of [ADDRESS_374074] be used within 
4 hours of any subsequent return to room temperature.  
 
d) If the thawed material is not administered within 24 hours of thawing, do not use for 
another participant.  
• Any empty vials, unused portion of ente red vials, or unused IV solution which 
contains VRC07 -523LS should be discarded in a biohazard containment bag and 
incinerated or autoclaved in accordance with institutional or pharmacy policy.  
 
e) Preparation is to be done using aseptic technique, in a limit ed access, laminar flow 
biosafety cabinet. Ensure that only the required vials are present in the preparation unit 
during dilution and that medication labels are strictly segregated to avoid mix -ups. 
 
3. Intravenous Infusion Preparation Instructions : 
 
a) After thawing, if product was refrigerated again at 2 -8°C, vials of VRC07 -523LS should be 
equilibrated to controlled room temperature (maximum 27°C) for a minimum of [ADDRESS_374075] 
preparation.  
 
b) Calculate the total milligrams of VRC07 -523LS required based on the participant’s 
weight and 40 mg/kg .  
• Remove the total number of vials required from storage based on a 6 mL or 2 
mL withdrawal volume containing 600 mg or 200 mg of VRC07 -523LS, 
respectivel y. 
 
c) Gently swirl thawed vials for 30 seconds to avoid foaming. DO NOT SHAKE VIALS. Keep 
the vials upright at all times until ready to withdraw the contents. Do not invert the vial 
during inspection.  
 
d) Observe vials for particles. If particles are observed , refer to the thawing instructions for 
further information , section 6.2.4 .2. 
 
e) Using aseptic technique, add the calculated volume of VRC07 -523LS (total calculated 
milligrams of VRC07 -523LS) to 100 mL IV bag of Sodium Chloride Injection, USP 0.9% 
that will also permit the addition of the required calculated volume of VRC07 -523LS. 
Alternatively, if the full VRC07 -523LS dose volume cannot be accommodated in IV bag 
containing the 100 mL of Sodium Chloride Injecti on, USP 0.9%, please refer to the -
Pharmacy Manual for further preparation instructions.  
 
The thawed VRC07 -523LS product will be added to Sodium Chloride Injection, USP 0.9% 
[ADDRESS_374076] and this should be  sufficient to 
accommodate all the planned dose levels for the eligible participants in this study.

• the dose of VRC07 - 523LS at 40  mg/kg ,   
• the total amount (mg) of VRC07 -523LS added to the 100 mL bag of normal 
saline ,  
• the final volume of the bag, and  
• lot number  
 
The prepared IV label should also be labeled with DO NOT INFUSE after date and time 
as follows:   
• 48 hours if stored at 2°C to 8°C  
• 4 hours, including completion of infusion, if s tored at controlled room 
temperature (not to exceed 2 7°C/80.6°F ) 
• Product may not be stored in direct sunlight  
 
h) Any unused portion of a VRC07 -523LS vial will not be used for another participant. Any 
empty vials, unused portion of entered vials, or unused IV solution which contains study 
product should be discarded in a biohazard contain ment bag and incinerated or 
autoclaved in accordance with institutional or pharmacy policy.  
 
4. VRC07 -523LS Disposition  
 
a) The empty vials and the unused portion of a vial will be discarded in a biohazard 
containment bag and incinerated or autoclaved.  
 
b) Any un opened vials that remain at the end of the study will be returned to the 
production facility or discarded at the discretion of the sponsor in accordance with 
policies that apply to investigational products.  
 
c) Partially used vials will not be administered t o other participants  or used for in vitro 
experimental studies. These vials will be disposed of in accordance with institutional or

7 STUDY INTERVENTION  DISCONTINUATION  AND PARTICIPANT  DISCONTINUATION /WITHDRAWAL  
 
7.1 DISCONTINUATION  OF STUDY INTERVENTI ON 
 
Participants for whom study interventions are discontinued should be counseled on the importance of 
continuing with the study and strongly encouraged to participate in follow -up visits and protocol - 
specified procedures.  
The VOR -07 Study  Version 4.0  
Protocol: IGHID [ADDRESS_374080] all participants who withdraw for reasons unrelated to drug toxicity. If participant  
withdrawal occurs prior to the initiation of the VRC07 -523LS infusions (Step 2 ), the participant  will have 
inadequate  data , and therefore “new” replacement participants can be enroll ed.  These p articipants will 
not be required to return for additional stu dy visits.  
 
Participants who are withdrawn for safety or drug toxicity reasons will continue on study  but off study 
treatment  for safety assessments per the end of treatment study visit (see SOE in Section 1.3 ).  Analys es 
will be completed on all participant samples, including blood, collected at the end of treatment study 
visit. The data may or may not be included in the final analyses but all clinical safety data will be 
included in the final C linical Study Report (CSR) . 
 
Participants who are no longer on treatment but are still followed on the study (with safety evaluations 
obtained per the SOE in Section 1.3 ) can be terminated from the study for the following reasons:  
• Uncontrolled intercurrent illness that prevents continuing study follow -up or regular study visits.  
• Noncompliance with protocol -required evaluations.  
• Participant request for discontinuation from the study, i.e., withdrawal of consent.  
• The Sponsor, Investigator, or regulatory agency terminates the study.  
 
7.2 PARTICIPANT  DISCONTINUATION /WITHDRAWAL  FROM THE S TUDY  
 
Study Treatment Discontinuation 
Under certain circumstances, an individual participant’s receipt of study product will be prematurely or 
permanently discontinued. Specific events that will result in stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a participant’s infus ions or VOR 
dosing in this study include:  
• Failure to meet requirements established for safety assessment  
• Withdrawal from the study  
• Pregnancy  
• Grade 3 AE assessed as related to the study products (with the exception that self -limited Grade 
3 solicited reac togenicity does not require discontinuation from VRC07 -523LS administration) . 
• Grade 4 AE assessed as related to the study products  
• Intercurrent illness that is not expected to resolve prior to the next scheduled VRC07 -523LS 
administration which  is assessed  by [CONTACT_9154] (or designee) to require withdrawal from the 
administration of VRC07 -523LS  
• Repeated failure to comply with protocol requirements  
• Co-enrollment into a study in which other investigational research agents will be administered 
before the par ticipants  has completed the follow -up visits after receiving the last study product  
• Investigator discretion  
• Clinically significant hypersensitivity or infusion -related reaction including but not limited to 
type 1 hypersensitivity reaction, urticaria, or serum sickness associated with study treatment .  
 
If the study Principal Investigator (or designee) decides that a participant should be withdrawn from 
study trea tment, the protocol team  must be alerted within 24 hours. All participants who discontinue 
treatments should comply with protocol -specified visits and follow -up as required by [CONTACT_305685] (or designee) . The only exception to  this requirement is when a participant 
withdraws consent for all study procedures or loses the ability to consent freely (i.e., is imprisoned or 
involuntarily incarcerated for the treatment of either a psychiatric or physical illness).  
The VOR -07 Study  Version 4.0  
Protocol: IGHID [ADDRESS_374081] be 
documented appropriately in the study documents.  
 
Early Study Discontinuation 
A participant may withdraw or be withdrawn from the study if any of the following occurs:  
• Failure by [CONTACT_3433] e participant to attend multiple clinic visits.  
• Failure to receive the first VRC07 -523LS infusion.  
• Development of an illness that requires treatment with medications prohibited  in this study.  
• Poor adherence to ART as judged by [CONTACT_305686] . 
• Request by [CONTACT_305687].  
• Request of the participant’s primary care provider if she/he thinks the study is no longer in the 
best interest of the participant.  
• Participant judged by [CONTACT_305688] [INVESTIGATOR_305626], as to cause harm to self or seriously interfere with the 
validity of the study results.  
• At the discretion of the IRB/Ethics Committee, FDA, NIH, and  other government agencies as part 
of their duties, Principal Investigator, or industry supporter.  
 
Premature Treatment Discontinuation Evaluations  
Participants who begin but do not complete all doses of VRC07 -523LS and VOR will be replaced. The 
collection  of virologic, immunologic, and 2nd leukapheresis samples following premature discontinuation 
will be determined on a case -by-case basis in discussion with the protocol team.  
 
Participants who complete Step s 2 and 3 but are unable to complete the leukapheresis (#2) in Step 4 will 
contribute to safety analyses and complete an end of study visit. The ability to complete virologic and 
immunologic endpoint analysis will be determined on a case -by-case basis in discussion with the 
protocol team . Replacement will be determined by [CONTACT_305689].  
 
Delaying VRC07- 523LS administration 
Under certain circumstances, a participant’s scheduled VRC07 -523LS infusion may  be delayed. The 
factors to be considered in such a decision include but are not limited to the following:  
 
Within [ADDRESS_374082] administration  
• Receipt of systemic glucocorticoids (e .g., prednisone or other glucocorticoids) or other 
immunomodulators (other than nonsteroidal anti-  inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs])  – Please 
reference paragraph below as these medications are prohibited on study.   
• Pre-infusion abnormal vital signs or clinical symp toms that may mask assessment of study 
product reaction.  
• Inability to dose with VOR due to clinical symptom or laboratory value.  
• Intercurrent illness that is not expected to resolve prior to the VRC07 -523LS infusion which is 
assessed by [CONTACT_16541] (or designee) to require delay or withdrawal from the 
study product administration schedule.  
 
Infusions should not be administered outside the visit window periods .  
 
The VOR -07 Study  Version 4.0  
Protocol: IGHID [ADDRESS_374083] infusion (Day 0) and multiple doses of VOR but before 
the 2nd VRC07 -523LS infusion (Day 60) or prior to completing the  seco nd series of multiple VOR doses, 
study treatment should be discontinued and the participant should continue on study for safety follow -
up as noted in the SOE or per the study PI (or designee). Collection of virologic, immunologic, and the 2nd 
leukapheresis samples following premature discontinuation will  be determined on a case -by-case basis 
in discussion with the protocol team. This participant will be replaced.  
 
 
7.[ADDRESS_374084] to follow -up (LTFU) need to meet both of the following criteria:  
• a) Failure to respond or reply to [ADDRESS_374085] attempts  followed by  
• b) Failure to respond to a certified letter sent to the address provided by [CONTACT_2299].  
 
Only after documentation of these failed attempts to connect with the participant, will they be 
determi ned to be LTFU.  
 
8 STUDY ASSESSMENTS AN D PROCEDURES  
 
8.1 EFFICACY ASSESSMENTS  
 
This section provides a general description of the procedures and assessments associated with this 
study.  
 
Informed Consent  
Prior to performing any study -related procedure s or assessments, the study coordinator discusses the 
study with the potential participant and obtains signed informed consent. This communication will be 
The VOR -07 Study  Version 4.0  
Protocol: IGHID [ZIP_CODE] 09 May 2019

 documented. Labs/procedures completed during a routine clinical care appointment that are the same 
as the study screening labs and/or procedures and completed within the 14 days preceding the 
screening visit can be used to qualify the participant upon approval by [CONTACT_9154] [INVESTIGATOR_1461].  
 
Screening  
At the screening visit, participants will screen for the  study. Only those participants who meet all 
eligibility criteria specified in Section 5.1 Inclusion Criteria and Section 5.2 Exclusion Criteria will be 
enrolled. A unique PID will be assigned during the screening visit.  
 
Participants who are unable to meet protocol -defined eligibility criteria at the Screening Visit (Step 1, 
Visit 1) may be eligible to re -screen again at the study PI (or designee)’s discretion. In such cases, the 
same PID will be used. If a screen failure or the failure to move to the n ext Step is due to the inability to 
meet one of the laboratory parameters (hematology, chemistry, HIV RNA, or CD4 T cell count), a 
laboratory retest of the failed criteria may be performed one time only. If the repeat value is within 
eligibility requiremen ts, the participant can enroll on the study.  
 
Enrollment  
Step 1 Visit 1 determines eligibility and enrollment occurs at Visit 2.  
 
Advancement to Step 2  
 
Step 2  
Participants enrolled on the study will advance to S tep 2 of the protocol based upon the following 
criteria:  
1. A frequency of resting CD4 T cell infection of ≥ 0.3 IUPM as determined by [CONTACT_305690] 1 Visit 2  
 
Note: Participants with prior participation in one of the follo wing UNC protocol s in which they 
had an IUPM measurement ≥0.3, will be able to use this previous measurement for 
advancement : 
 IRB 08 -1575 (CID 0819)  - Apheresis Procedures to Obtain Leukocytes for Research Studies 
from HIV Positive Subjects ; 
 IRB 11 -0228 (CID 0807)  - [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ;

 IRB 18 -0944 (IGHID 1801) - The HIV Reservoir In Women: Implication For HIV Cure 
Strategies     
 
Note: Participants with these results and measurements from one of the above listed stud ies, would be 
able to use these results for advancement to Step 2, but would need to repeat the leukapheresis at Visit 
[ADDRESS_374086] been administered.  
 
 
The VOR -07 Study  Version 4.0  
Protocol: IGHID [ADDRESS_374087] 30 days and any significant medical conditions (e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], surgeries, 
prior medical history) should be collected. Medical history obtained at Screening will include 
demographic information (e .g., date of birth, gender, race, and ethnicity, etc .), participant’s medical 
history, and HIV medication history.  
 
Prior and Concomitant Medications  
All concomitant medications administ ered from screening until the end -of-study visit must be recorded 
in the source  documents . Prescription and non -prescription medications taken within [ADDRESS_374088] be recorded on the source document.  
 
All routine prescription medications,  over -the-counter medications , supplements , and study provided 
medications and investigational products  will be entered in the study -specific database , starting  at the 
time of enrollment  through the EOS.  
 
Antiretroviral (ART) Medication Assessment  
During the study, all modifications to the participant’s ART regimen, including any ARV interruptions, 
dose modifications, formulations modifications, starts, and permanent discontinuations since the last 
study visit or at the study visit must be recorded.  
 
ART A dherence  
ART adherence will be reviewed at every visit. Non -adherence will be defined as missing doses for more 
than 2 consecutive days or more than 4 cumulative days during the study . Assess any missed doses 
while on study and discuss with Study PI (or de signee). Continuance on study will be contingent on 
adherence.  
 
Physical Examination  
Complete physical examination will include examination of skin, head, eyes, ears, nose, throat, lymph 
nodes, heart, chest, lungs, abdomen, extremities, and neurologic system according t o schedule specified 
in the SOE in section  1.3.  
 
A directed physical exam will be performed at all clinical visits where a complete physical examination is 
not pe rformed, according to the SOE in section 1.[ADDRESS_374089] -entry signs and symptoms, Grade ≥ 2, will 
be recorded. All signs or symptom s, definitely, possibly, or probably related to study interventions, will 
be recorded, regardless of grade. Additionally, all signs and symptoms that lead to a change in study 
treatment or change in ART, regardless of grade, must be recorded.  
 
 
The VOR -07 Study  Version 4.0  
Protocol: IGHID [ADDRESS_374090] appears during treatment, which was absent before or which worsens relative to the 
pre-treatment state.  
 
Vital Signs  
Vital signs (weight, body temperature, pulse  or heart rate , respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and seated blood pressure) 
will be rec orded according to the SOE in section 1.[ADDRESS_374091] administrations will be completed per the SOE, section 1.3. Prior to e ach infusion, 
temperature (T), b lood pressure (BP) , heart rate  or pulse (P ), respi[INVESTIGATOR_697] (RR),  and weigh t will be 
collected an d a targeted PE (based on signs, reported symptoms , or interim medical history) conducted. 
The participant will be observed for at least [ADDRESS_374092] 30 – [ADDRESS_374093] after the 3 -day Solicited AE assessment period, or sooner if indicated. 
In general, a participant who self -reports any reaction following an infusion that is greater than mild is 
seen by a clinician within 48 hours after onset, unless the reaction is improving and/or has completely 
resolved. Clinic study staff will follow new or unresolved Solicited AEs present at day [ADDRESS_374094] -
related lesions.  
 
Assessment of Systemic and Local Symptoms  
Systemic symptoms to be assessed a s solicited AEs include increased body temperature, chills, malaise 
and/or fatigue, headache, myalgia, arthralgia, nausea, urticaria, non -exertional dyspnea, non -exertional 
tachycardia (assessed by [CONTACT_305691], not by [CONTACT_2299]), generalized pruritus, facial flushing, and 
unexplained diaphoresis.  
 
Local symptoms include pain or tend erness at the infusion  site. The daily maximum severity reached for

 Body temperature is measured by [CONTACT_305692]. If 
temperature is measured in Fahrenheit, the conversion to Celsius should be documented in the 
participant’s chart note. A measurement is taken once daily during the assessment period and sh ould be 
repeated if participant is feeling feverish.  
 
Assessment of Infusion Site 
Typi[INVESTIGATOR_305627]/redness and induration/swelling. The maximum horizontal 
and maximum vertical measurements  for all infusion site  reactions are recorded.  
 
All infusion/injection site reactions are monitored until resolution. Areas greater than 25 cm2 are 
followed daily; otherwise, the frequency of follow -up is based on clinician judgment.  
 
VRC07 -523LS Post Infusion Telephone Follow -Up 
Participants will have a telephone interview with a study coordinator 4 - 6 days following each infusion to 
review the solicited AE assessment tool. Any incidents or events identified that could be related to the 
infusion and are still unresolved at  Day 3, will require participants to come into clinic for clinical 
assessment.  
 
Leukapheresis  
Participants will undergo 2 leukapheresis procedures . The baseline leukapheresis will be completed at 
Visit 2 . Participant s will advan ce to Step 2  based on the attainment of an IUPM measurement ≥ 0.3. The 
second leukapheresis will occur 5 – [ADDRESS_374095]  will be transported on the day of collection to the Margolis 
Laboratory on the UNC campus.  
 
NOTE: Refer to the UNC Apheresis SOP and Study Specific Lab Manual for procedures specific to this 
study.  
 
If participants experience a Grade 3 or higher toxicity  before completing the screening leukapheresis, 
they will be discontinued from study, as completing the leukapheresis procedures is a requirement of 
the study. Participants who experience a Grade 3 or higher toxicity during the leukapheresis will be 
evaluated on a case -by-case basis to understand the cause of the Grade 3 event. If the clinical situations 
(i.e., vasovagal response) that lead to the discontinuation of the leukapheresis procedure is determined 
by [CONTACT_9154] [INVESTIGATOR_305628] s Medical Director to be situational and poses no 
apparent harm to the participant, the leukapheresis procedure may be repeated. However, if 
determined by [CONTACT_9154], Apheresis Medical Director, and/ or the M edical Monitor that repeated 
leukapheresis woul d be harmful to the participant, then he/she will be terminated from the study.  
The only exception to this discontinuation policy will be related to elevations in blood pressure (BP). 
Transiently elevated BPs to Grade s 2 and 3 are frequently observed during this procedure, secondary to 
the BP cuff placement and nervousness of the participant. Elevated BP observed during the 
leukapheresis procedure will be monitored via Apheresis Lab policies. These will be noted and 
documented but will not be used to discontinue study participation.  
 
Clinical Laboratory Tests  
Blood and urine specimens will be collected according to the SOE in section 1.3 . Safety laboratory tests 
should be performed and reviewed before study drug adminis tration.

Laboratory Assays  
Study specific safety and research assays will be collected at the research visit s. Safety and clinically 
relevant labs will be performed at UNC McLendon Laboratories or LabCorp. Research assays will be 
processed and stored in a ssociated research laboratories. Additional details on collection, processing, 
storage, and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_305629].  
 
End of Treatment/End of Study Visit  
An End of Study (EOS) vis it sho uld occur approximately [ADDRESS_374096] protocol-
specified visit/assessment  (EOS). Participants who have treatment discontinued due to a DLT or other 
clinical event will be followed on study until the clinical event is resolved  or deemed stable and 
irreversible . Participants will complet e the EOS visit per the SOE (section 1.3) but will be followed as 
necessary for acceptable resolution of the clinical event.    
 
Participants will be considered not to have completed the study if consent was withdrawn, the study 
Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_305630], or the 
participant was lost to follow -up. 
 
A list of evaluations to be performed for the EOS  visit is provided in the SOE in section 1.3.  The EOS Visit 
should be performed after the par ticipant has met off -study criteria, or has been followe d for at least [ADDRESS_374097] VRC07 -523LS dose. Participants experiencing an unresolved AE will be followed until 
the AE is either resolved or deemed stable and irreversible.  
 
Research Laboratory Assays  
 
The ability of  VRC07 -523LS infusion in combination with multiple doses of VOR  to alter markers of 
persistent HIV -1 infection in individuals on suppressive ART will be evaluated by [CONTACT_305693]: a) the 
frequency of resting CD4  T cell infection by [CONTACT_305694] b) levels of plasma HIV-1 RNA, as measured by 
[CONTACT_305695]-1 RNA assay . 
 
Resting CD4 T Cell Infection (RCI)  
Lymphocytes are obtained by [CONTACT_104940] -flow leukapheresis (samples obtained as per the SOE, section 
1.3) and resting CD4 T cells are isolated as previously described (57) .  
 
QVOA measurements will be conducted with the leukapheresis samples collected prior to and following 
combined VOR/VRC07 -523LS admin istration  to determine if the frequency of resting CD4 T cell 
infection, expressed as IUPM, has declined. Since RCI frequency is a definitive measure of the minimum 
size of the HIV reservoir, a statistically significant decline in response to VRC07 -523LS in combinat ion 
with VOR treatment would be definitive evidence of a reduction in the HIV reservoir.  
 
Plasma for A ssays that measure low levels of RNA   
Residual low -level v iremia will be measured , as evidence suggests that such viremia originates in 
persi stently infected cells, and low -level viremia might be reduced by [CONTACT_305696]. Plasma for HIV -1 RNA will be obtaine d as required per the SOE in section 1.3  and stored for 
batched analyses. Two baseline sample determinations will be obtained during Step s 1 and 2 of the

Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) T ypi[INVESTIGATOR_305631] ; however, if HLA type is already available in 
the medical record , it does not need to be repeated. The result will be used for research purposes.  
 
Cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) IgG Testing  
We will perform CMV testing for research purposes  only   at baseline ( Visit 2 ) and after the 10th dose of 
VOR in Step s [ADDRESS_374099] it in the plasma. The result s will not be placed in 
the participant’s medical record .  
 
Epstein -Barr Virus (EBV) Viral Capsid Antigen (VCA) IgG Testing  
We will perform EBV testing for research purposes  only at baseline ( Visit 2 ) and after the 10th dose of 
VOR in Step [ADDRESS_374100] it in the plasma. The results will not be placed in the 
participant’s medical record  
 
Vorinostat PK samples  
Pharmacokinetic samples will be collected at 3 time points in the study. These will b e processed and 
stored for testing as required.  
 
VRC07- 523LS  PK samples  
Pharmacokinetic samples will be collected at 3 time points : at baseline and after antibody 
administration at Days 29 (Visit 6 ) and 89 (Visit 1 1). These will be processed, stored , and shipped for 
testing as required . 
 
Anti-Drug Antibody (ADA)  Detection Assay  
ADA will be measured by [CONTACT_305697] (MSD) platform with VRC07 -523LS as the 
target antigen.  Anti-VRC07- 523LS antibody assays will be performed on serum sample s collected at 
baseline and after antibody administration  at Days 29 (Visit 6 ) and 89 (Visit 11 ). Serum will be stored at 
other visits per the SOE. Additional ADA testing  may be performed  on participants if indicated .  
 
Virology and Viral Sequence Analysis  
Samples will be collected per the SOE. Samples will be processed, stored , and analyzed as required.  
 
Cell associated RNA Assay (caRNA)  
Samples collected to isolate  resting CD4 T cells and run the caRNA assay  to have an additional baseline 
point. It will provide  an idea of the baseline variation in caRNA of a given participant. This is important in 
trying to measure a change in c aRNA after the intervention.

Solicited AE Assessments  
Participants will be given a “Post -infusion AE Assessment ” tool to use as a memory aid for tracking AEs  
that occur during the [ADDRESS_374115] daily temperature and 
symptoms.  
 
For this study, solicited AEs occurring during the 3 days after receipt of study agent will include :  
 
Localized  Symptoms  Systemic Symptoms  
• Erythema (redness)  •  Fatigue  
• Local pain/tenderness  •  Headache  
• Warmth at infusion site  •  Fever >37.7°C or 99.9°F

Participants will also record the highest measured temperature daily. Participants should be instructed 
to take their temperature at least once daily, starting with the day of infusion (day 0), after leav ing the 
clinic and through day [ADDRESS_374116] -infusion . 
 
Temperature should be  taken orally  or via infrared thermometry and  in the evening whenever possible. 
If more than one measurement is made in a day (for example , due to feeling unwell), then the highest 
temperature taken that day should be recorded.  
 
Participants will have a t elephone interview with a study coordinator 4 - 6 days following each VRC07 -
523LS infusion to review the solicited AE assessment tool. Any incidents or events identified that could 
be related to the infusion and are still unresolved after Day 3, will require participants to come into clinic 
for clinical assessment. Telephone conversation will be documented and signed off by [CONTACT_9154].  
 
Events occurring during the Solicited  AE Assessment period that may require a clinic visit based on th e 
judgment of a study clinician include:  
• Rash,  
• Urticaria,  
• Fever of 38.6˚C (Grade 2) or higher lasting greater than 24 hours ,  
• A significant impairment in the activities of daily living (such as those consistent with Grade 2 or

8.3 ADVERSE EVENTS AND SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  
 
8.3.1 DEFINITION OF ADVERS E EVENTS (AE)  
 
Adverse event means any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of an intervention in 
humans, whether or not considered intervention -related (21 CFR 312.32 (a)).  
 
An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding, for example), symptom , or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal 
produ ct, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. This includes any occurrence that 
is new in onset or aggravated in severity or frequency from the baseline condition, or abnormal results 
of diagnostic procedures, including laboratory test ab normalities.

65 
  
8.3.2 DEFINITION OF SERIOU S ADVERSE EVENTS (SA E)  
 
An adverse event ( AE) or suspected adverse reaction is considered "serious" if, in the view of either the 
investigator or sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes:  
• death,  
• a life -threatening adverse event,  
• inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081],  
• a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal 
life functions, or  
• a congenital anomaly/birth defe ct.  
 
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6721], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the 
participant  and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in 
this definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive 
treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias , or co nvulsions that do not result in 
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
 
8.3.3 CLASSIFICATION OF AN  ADVERSE EVENT  
[IP_ADDRESS]  SEVERITY OF EVENT  
 
Event severity will be assigned according to the Investigator’s assessment.  
 
Severity Gr ade for Parameters Not Identified in the Grading Table:  
The functional table below should be used to grade the severity of an AE that is not specifically 
identified in the grading table. In addition, all deaths related to an AE are to be classified as Grade 5.

[IP_ADDRESS]  RELATIONSHIP TO STUD Y INTERVENTION  
 
Attribution/Assessment of Causality is a determination that describes the relationship or association of 
the study product with an adverse event.  
 
The VOR -07 Study  Version 4.0  
Protocol: IGHID [ZIP_CODE] 09 May 2019 
66 
 This assessment of causality or relationship of AEs to the study drug is provided by [CONTACT_305705] 1) temporal relationship of the event to the administration of study drug; 2) whether 
an alternative etiology has been identified, an d 3) biological plausibility. Causality must be assessed 
separately for each study drug.  
 
The causality assessment categories that will be used for this study are described below.  
 
1. Causality assessments that are considered not related to study drug:  
a. Not related:   
The event is related to an etiology other than the study drug (the alternative etiology 
must be documented in the participant’s medical record).  
 
If an SAE is considered "unrelated" to study drug, the Investigator should offer his/her clinical 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_305638](s), agent(s), or process(s) were the likely causative mechanism for the 
event.  
 
2. Causality assessments that are considered related  to study drug:  
a. Possible:   
There is an association between the event and the administration of the stu dy drug and 
there is a plausible mechanism for the event to be related to study drug; but there may 
also be alternative etiology, such as characteristics of the participant’s clinical status or 
underlying disease.  
 
b. Probable:   
There is an association betwee n the event and the administration of study drug, a 
plausible mechanism for the event to be related to the study drug , and the event could 
not be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_143140]’s  clinical status 
or an alternative etiology is not apparent.  
 
c. Definite:  
There is an association between the event and the administration of study drug; a 
plausible mechanism for the event to be related to the study drug, causes other than 
the study drug have been ruled out, and/or the event re -appea red on re -exposure to 
the study drug.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  EXPECTEDNESS  
 
The study PI (or designee)  will be responsible for determining whether an adverse event ( AE) is expected 
or unexpected.  An AE will be considered unexpected if the nature, severity, or frequency of the event is 
not consistent with the risk information previously described for the study intervention  or is not listed in 
the most current IBs for the study intervention . 
8.3.4 TIME PERIOD AND FREQUENCY FOR EVENT ASSESSMENT AND FOLLOW -UP 
 
The occurrence of an adverse event ( AE) or serious adverse event ( SAE) may come to the attention of 
study personnel during study visits and interviews of a study participant  presenting for medical care, o r 
upon review of medical record . 
The VOR -07 Study  Version 4.0  
Protocol: IGHID [ZIP_CODE] 09 May 2019 
67 
  
The study unsolicited AE reporting p eriod will be from enrollment (D ay 0) through  the end of study visit .   
During Step 1 (p eriod between consent and  Day 0), any AE that occurs will be collected as concurrent 
medical history (pre -existing condition) and not as an AE, unless it is due to a protocol –related 
procedure (leukapheresis) .  
 
All AEs including local and systemic reactions not meeting the criteria for SAE s will be captured in the 
research record on the appropriate  form . Information  collected includes :  
• Event description,  
• Time of onset,  
• Study PI’s (or designee ’s) assessment of severity, relationship to study product  and 
expectedness,  
• Time of resolution/stabilization of the event.   
 
All AEs occurring while on study must be documented appropriately regardless of relationship. All AEs 
will be followed to adequate resolution.  
 
Any medical condition that is present at the time that the participant is screen ed will be considered 
baseline and not reported as an AE. However, if the study participant’s condition deteriorates at any 
time during the study, it will be recorded as an AE.  
 
Changes in the severity of an AE will be documented to allow an assessment of the duration of the e vent 
at each level of severity to be performed. AEs characterized as intermittent require documentation of 
onset and duration of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865].  
 
The study  research coordinator will record all reportable events with start dates occurring any time on 
or after the enrollment visit until 7 (for non -serious AEs) or 30 days (for SAEs) after the last day of study 
participation.  At each study visit, the research coordinator will inquire about the occurrence of AE/SAEs 
since the last visit.  Events will be followed  for outcome information unt il resolution or stabilization.  
 
Clinical Laboratory Changes:  
 
Safety laboratory assessments will be carried out locally at UNC and evaluated by [CONTACT_737] (or 
designee) to ensure participant safety. The Investigator (or designee) is responsible for reviewing the 
results of all laboratory tests as they become available.  
• Laboratory values that fall outside of a clinically accepted reference range or differ significantly 
from previous values must be evaluated for clinical s ignificance  by [CONTACT_737] (or 
designee) . The Investigator (or designee) may repeat the laboratory test or request additional 
tests to verify the results of the original laboratory tests.  
• If the Investigator (or designee) determines the laboratory value is an abnormal change from 
baseline and is of clinical significance for that participant, it is considered an AE.  
• Generally, Grade 1 and Grade 2 laboratory findings need not be reported as AEs unless deemed 
clinically significant by [CONTACT_737] (or designee).  
• Consistent with the DAIDS designation of Grade 3 events as severe or medically significant and 
Grade 4 events as life -threatening, Grade 3 and Grade 4 laboratory findings should b e reported 
as AEs or SAEs, as appropriate.  
The VOR -07 Study  Version 4.0  
Protocol: IGHID [ZIP_CODE] 09 May 2019 
68 
 • The test result or finding should be reported as the AE. Such laboratory values should generally 
be recorded as “increased” or “decreased” (e.g., change from baseline potassium of 5.0 to 3.5 
mEq/L = potassium dec reased).  
 
The study PI (or designee) is responsibl e for appropriate reporting of adverse events to the regulatory 
authorities. The study PI (or designee) will also report all suspected unexpected serious adverse 
reactions. The study PI (or designee) must r eport suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions to the 
UNC IRB, unless otherwise required and documented by [CONTACT_206549]. 
 
8.3.5 ADVERSE EVENT REPORT ING  
 
Adverse events will be graded according to the DAIDS Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and 
Pediat ric Adverse Events (DAIDS AE Grading Table), corrected Version 2.1, July 2017, on the DAIDS RSC 
website at http://rsc.tech -res.com/clinical -research- sites/safety -reporting/daids -grading- tables  
 
Participants will be monitored for adverse events. Toxicities will be characterized in terms including 
duration, intensity, and time to onset. Safety endpoints will incl ude all adverse experiences, in addition 
to laboratory safety assessments, and vital signs. All AEs will be recorded on the appropriate study form. 
All AEs will be recorded in the database if any of the following criteria have been met:   
• Study -related grade ≥ 1  AEs 
• Grade ≥ 3 AEs  
• Autoimmune -related AEs regardless of grade  
• HIV viral loads ≥ 50 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL  
• Infusion  reactions regardless of grade  
• AEs that led to a change in study intervention regardless of grade  
• AEs meeting SAE definition or EAE (Expedited Adverse Event) reporting requirement  
 
Grade [ADDRESS_374119] clinical practice and documented. Participants who 
experience a Grade 1 or 2 AE that is judged related  to the study treatments by [CONTACT_9154] (or 
designee), may continue study treatment at the discretion of the study PI (or designee).  
 
Participants who experience a Grade 1 or 2 AE that is judged not to be related to the stu dy drug/product  
by [CONTACT_9154] (or designee) , may continue study treatment at the discretion of the study PI (or 
designee) .   
 
Grade 3 Toxicity  
 
For participants who develop a Grade 3 AE following administration of VRC07 -523LS  or VOR that is 
judged by [CONTACT_9154] (or designee) to be at  least possibly study treatment- related, the protocol team , 
inclusive of the DAIDS Medical Officer, must be notified within 24 hours. Participants experiencing Grade 
3 AEs should be followed closely and if the AE does not return to Grade ≤ 2 within 2 weeks , the study 
team should again be notified within 24 hours  and the SMC will be notified. Continued receipt of study

 products is at the discretion of the study PI (or designee) in consultation with the protocol team and the 
SMC.  
 
For participants who experi ence a Grade 3 AE that is judged not related to the study treatment by [CONTACT_1275], continued study participation is at the discretion of the study PI (or designee)  in 
consultation with the protocol team  and SMC.  
 
Grade 4 Toxicity   
 
For participants who develop a Grade 4 AE following administration of VRC06 -523LS  or VOR that is 
judged by [CONTACT_9154] (or designee)  to be at least possibly study treatment- related, the protocol team , 
the DIADS Medical Officer and SMC must be notified wit hin 24 hours. Participants experiencing Grade 4 
AEs should be followed closely with additional clinical assessments and laboratory testing as clinically 
indicated. If the AE does not return to Grade ≤ 2 within 2 weeks, the protocol  team and SMC should 
again be notified within 24 hours.  
 
All study treatments will be discontinued  in the event of Grade 4 AEs possibly related to study 
treatment.  
 
Local or Systemic Reactions  to VRC07 -523LS  
 
Grade 1 or 2  
Local reactions of mild (Grade 1) or moderate (Grade 2) severity will usually resolve spontaneously. If 
needed, they may be managed with local application of cold packs, oral acetaminophen, oral non -
steroidal anti- inflammatory agents, or a combination of these measures as appropriate.  
 
NOTE: Topi[INVESTIGATOR_305639].  
 
Grade 3 or 4  
For severe (Grade 3) or potentially life -threatening (Grade 4) local reactions, the protocol team , inclusive 
of the DAIDS Medical Officer,  must be notified within 24 hours. For Grade 4 local reaction s, definitive 
medical and/or surgical intervention should be undertaken as appropriate. Further infusions will not be 
administered.  
 
Systemic Reactions  
The protocol team , inclusive of the DAIDS Medical Officer, must be contact[CONTACT_11252] [ADDRESS_374120] (AE SI) occurs  (see section 8.3.8) , the study coordinator, in 
collaboration with the study PI (or designee), will evaluate the severity and seriousness of the AE and 
the relationship to the study treatment, and will document the findings . 
 
The protocol team , inclusive of the DAIDS Medical Officer, should be contact[CONTACT_11252] 24 hours of 
notification of any reactions thought definitely, possibly, or probably related to the VRC07 -523LS

 Infusion Site reaction 
Infusion Site Erythema or Redness and Infu sion Site Induration or Swelling will not be consider ed 
interference with usual social and functional activities such that:  
• Grade 1 is: 2.5 to < 5 cm in diameter OR 6.25 to < 25 cm2 surface area;  
• Grade 2 is: ≥ 5 to < 10 cm in diameter OR ≥ 25 to < 100 cm2 surface area;  
• Grade 3 is: ≥ 10 cm in diameter OR ≥ 100 cm2 surface area OR Ulceration OR Secondary infection 
OR Phlebitis OR Sterile abscess OR Drainage;  
• Grade 4 is: Potentially life -threatening consequences (e .g., abscess, exfoliative dermatitis, 
necr osis involving dermis or deeper tissue)  
 
Allergic or Hypersensitivity Reactions  
Record all allergic and hypersensitivity reactions with both grade severity and attribution.   
Serious allergic or hypersensitivity reactions (≥ Grade 3) that are deemed possib ly related to the study 
treatment by [CONTACT_9154] (or designee) will be report ed to the protocol team and SMC within [ADDRESS_374121] sponsors within 48 hours per their 
reporting requirements . 
 
Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT)  
• Hematologic dose -limiting toxicity will be defined as any confirmed toxicity ≥ Grade 2, that 
cannot clearly be attributed to another reversible cause. These participants will not receive 
further doses of VOR or VRC07 -523LS.  
 
• Follow participants per protocol schedule of events until the lab abnormality or toxicity resolves 
to ≤ Grade 1 or the participant’s baseline.  
 
• Non -hematologic dose -limiting toxicity will be defined as any confirmed symptomatic ≥ Grade 3, 
if related (definitely, probably, or possibly) to VOR or VRC07 -523LS 
 
Monitoring HIV RNA levels  
In the event of v iremia of ≥ 50 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/m L the following should occur per standard of care:  
• Adherence to ART should be carefully assessed and documented.  
• A standard HIV RNA assay should be repeat ed within 1 -4 weeks . 
• HIV resistance testing will be performed at the time of drawing a  confirmatory sample.  
• HIV RNA will be r epeat ed every 2 weeks , or sooner as clinically indicated , until <50 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL 
and the participant can continue on study.  
• If persistent viremia is documented , ongoing administration of study treatment will be reviewed 
on a case -by-case basis with the participant, their HIV provider,  and the study team .   
 
In the event of confirmed viremia and documented adherence to ART , ART should be managed by [CONTACT_305706]. The results of the HIV resistance tests will be 
shared with the partic ipants and their care providers . 
 
Immediately Reportable Events  
Immediately Reportable Events (IREs) are events that must be reported immediately to the sponsor 
within 24 hours of the study site’s awareness of the event:  
• All SAEs  
• Pregnancy in a study participant or partner of a study participant  
The VOR -07 Study  Version 4.0  
Protocol: IGHID [ZIP_CODE] 09 May 2019 
71 
 • All ≥ Grade 2 Cytokin e Release Syndrome/Infusion -Related Reaction s 
• Administration of a dose significantly greater (specifically, + 20 % or higher) than the planned 
dose, and results in an event of clinical consequence  
• AEs leading to permanent discontinuation of study drug in an individual participant  
• Withdrawal of the participant from study drug administration  during or after receipt of any 
doses of VRC07 -523LS or VRC07- 523LS in combination with VOR  for any reason  
• Product quality issues with an associated clinical consequence .  
 
In those cases, in which the IRE is considered related to study drug, the study drug may be discontinued 
and the participant will continue participation in the study for observational safety and analysis (except 
for cases where the participant is withd rawn from the study by [CONTACT_9154] (or designee) or withdrew 
their consent). At any time after completion of the study, if an Investigator becomes aware of a serious 
adverse event that s/he suspects is related to  study drug, the study PI (or designee) sho uld report the 
event to NIH,  VRC, [COMPANY_006], FDA, and the UNC IRB, if applicable . 
 
The study PI (or designee) is responsibl e for appropriate reporting of AEs  to the regulatory authorities.  
 
The Protocol Core Team will monitor the conduct and safety of the stu dy via monthly meeting s and 
regular summaries. Accrual, baseline characteristics, conduct of the study (including premature study 
discontinuations), any interruptions of ART, virologic failures, and all reported toxicities and events will 
be monitored duri ng the study and discussed with the protocol team on a monthly basis or more 
frequently, if needed.  
 
The study protocol team will review the individual safety data monthly to assess relation of all reported 
toxicities and AEs to the study treatment. A stu dy unique independent Safety Monitoring Committee 
(SMC) will receive monthly study progress and safety monitoring reports. Study feasibility and the 
achievement of study milestones will be assessed in these reports.  
 
The DAIDS program and medical officers will review and assess the monthly safety reports, as well as 
EAE reports for potential impact on the study participant safety and protocol conduct as per DAIDS 
policies, guidance documents, and SOPs, as applicable.  
 
8.3.[ADDRESS_374122] be reported to the UNC IRB per the UNC IRB reporting 
requirements. A written report (Serious Adverse Event Report Form) will be submitted to DAIDS and 
DAIDS MO within [ADDRESS_374123] dose of study drug administration, only SAEs the study PI (or designee) 
considers related to study drug or a protocol procedure, should be reported. Information regarding SAEs 
will be submitted to the DAIDS on required SAE reporting form s, which must be complet ed and signed 
by [CONTACT_9154] [INVESTIGATOR_1461], and sent within 24 hours of the site becoming aware of the SAE.  
 
All Grade 3 or Grade 4 AE/SAEs considered related to study drug must be followed until recovery to 
baseline or Grade 1 with the date  of resolution recorded in the source documents. In addition, the 
The VOR -07 Study  Version 4.0  
Protocol: IGHID [ZIP_CODE] 09 May 2019 
72 
 investigator should report all follow -up for reportable Grade 3 or Grade 4 AE/SAEs to the UNC IRB. 
Resolution of an event is defined as the return to pre -treatment status or stabilization of the condition 
with the expectation that it will remain chronic.  
 
All SAEs that have not resolved by [CONTACT_2054], or that have not resolved upon discontinuation 
of the participant's participation in the study, must be followed until any of the following occurs:  
• The event resolves.  
• The event stabilizes.  
• The event returns to baseline, if a baseline value/status is available.  
• The event can be attributed to etiology other than the study drug or to factors unrelated to 
study conduct.  
• It becomes unlikely that any additional information can be obtained (participant ’s or health care 
practitioner’s  refusal to provide additional information, or lost to follow -up after demonstration 
of due diligence with follow -up efforts).  
 
Any event requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (or prol ongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) that occurs dur ing the course of a 
participant 's participation in a study must be reported as a n SAE, except hospi[INVESTIGATOR_43716]:  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_23742] (e.g., so cial reasons such 
as pending placement in long- term facility).  
• Surgery or procedure planned before entry into the study (must be documented in the source 
document).  
 
The study PI (or designee) will be responsible for notifying the FDA, VRC , and [COMPANY_006], Inc.  of any 
unexpected fatal or life -threatening suspected adverse reaction as soon as possible, but in no case later 
than 7 calendar days after the sponsor's initial receipt of the information.  In addition, the sponsor must 
notify FDA in an IND safety report  of potential serious risks, from clinical trials or any other source, as 
soon as possible, but in no case later than [ADDRESS_374124] regular (annual or 
more frequent) presentations with the local and natio nal HIV+ and affected community. Due to the lack 
of evidence thus far that our studies have a clinical impact, we discuss the scientific findings in a general 
way with each participant after EOS visits . Our studies have extremely stringent stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3418], and 
thus far we have had no relevant or study -related SAEs to report. We would inform all study participants 
by [CONTACT_305707].   
 
8.3.[ADDRESS_374125] (AESI; serious or non -serious) is one of scientific and medical 
concern specific to the protocol team, for which ongoing monitoring and rapid communication to the 
protocol team  is required . These events might warrant further investigation in order to characterize and 
The VOR -07 Study  Version 4.0  
Protocol: IGHID [ADDRESS_374126] manufacturers (i.e. , regulators) might also be warranted . 
 
AESI  for this protocol include those listed below. Updates to AESI will be added as an amendment to this 
protocol.  
• Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  
• Systemic scleroderma (SSD) (Systemic sclerosis [SSc]), including diffuse s ystemic form and  CREST 
syndrome  
• Sjogren’s syndrome (SS)  
• Polymyositis/Dermatomyositis syndrome (PM/DM)  
• Raynaud’s syndrome  
• Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS)  
• Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP)  
• Crohn’s disease  
• Ulcerative colitis  
 
8.3.[ADDRESS_374127] be discontinued 
immediately. Although not considered an adverse experience, it is the responsibility of investigators or 
their designees to report any pregnancy in a participant or participant’s partner (spontaneously 
reported to them) th at occurs during the study or within [ADDRESS_374128] be followed to the completion/termination of 
the pregnancy. If the pregnancy continues to term, the outcome (health of infant)  must also be reported 
the UNC IRB, the DAIDS Medical Officer,  and the FDA (U S Food and Drug Administration).  
 
If a male participant impregnates his partner while he is participating in this study, the pregnancy must 
be reported and the study PI (or designee) should make a concerted effort to follow the pregnancy and 
outcome. The study PI (or designee)  will make every effort to obtain a medical release and a separate 
pregnancy outcome consent from the pregnant partner granting permission to follow  the health of both 
the pregnant partner and her unborn child to the UNC IRB, DAIDS, VRC, [COMPANY_006] and FDA without delay 
and within 24 hours if the outcome is an  SAE (e.g. death, abortion, congenital anomaly, or other 
disabling or life -threatening complicatio n to the mother or newborn).  
 
Pregnancy and pregnancy outcome will be recorded. Pregnancies that occur on study should be 
reported prospectively to The Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry. More information is available at 
www.apregistry.com. Telephone: 800 -258-4263; Fax: 800- 800-1052.  
 
Pregnancy Outcomes and Reporting  
If a woman has completed the study or chooses to discontinue from the study before the end of the 
pregnancy, then site study staff should request permission via a separate pregnancy outcome con sent to 
contact [CONTACT_305708]. If the information is obtained, 
pregnancy outcomes will be submitted at the end of the pregnancy.  
The VOR -07 Study  Version 4.0  
Protocol: IGHID [ADDRESS_374129] should be obtained. If 
pregnancy is confirmed , then further study treatment will be discontinued and the woman should 
continue on study (off study medication) safety follow -up visits as noted in the SOE. Stored 
plasma/PBMC for stor ed plasma for virologic studies should not be obtained to minimize blood volume.  
The site study staff should request permission via a separate pregnancy outcome consent to contact [CONTACT_305709]. A visit 6 months f ollowing the end of pregnancy 
will be conducted to assess for evidence of adverse events (AEs) in the participant and infant and 
documented.  
 
8.4 NEW SAFETY INFORMATI ON 
 
8.4.1 DEFINITION OF NEW SAFETY INFORMATI ON (NSI) 
 
The Office for Human Research Protections ( OHRP ) considers new safety information  involving risks to 
participants or others to include, in general, any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all  of the 
following criteria:  
 
• Unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency given (a) the res earch procedures /study 
treatment  that are described in the protocol -related documents, such as the Institutional 
Review Board ( IRB)-approved research protocol,  the informed consent document  and 
Investigator’s Brochure (IB) ; and (b) the characteristics of the participant population being 
studied;  
• Related or possibly related to participation in the research (“possibly related” means there is a 
reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_242180] /treatment  involved in the research); and  
• Suggests that the research places participants or others at a greater risk of harm (including 
physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized.  
 
8.4.2  NEW SAFETY INFORMATI ON REPORTING  
 
The investigator will report NSI to the UNC IRB. The NSI report will include the following information:  
 
• Protocol identifying information: protocol title and number, PI’s name, and the IRB project 
number;  
• A detailed description of the event, incident, experience, or outcome;  
• An explanation of the basis for determining that the event, incident, experience, or outcome 
represents the NSI ;  
• A description of any changes to the protocol or other corrective action s that have been taken or 
are proposed in response to the NSI . 
 
To satisfy the requirement for prompt reporting, NSI s will be reported using the following timeline:   
 
The VOR -07 Study  Version 4.0  
Protocol: IGHID [ZIP_CODE] 09 May 2019 
75 
 • NSIs that are serious adverse events ( SAEs) will be reported to the IRB and the DAIDS MO  within 
3 business days  of the investigator becoming aware of the event.  
• Any other NSIs  will be  reported to the IRB and to the DAIDS MO within 7 business days of the 
investigator becoming aware of the event.  
• All NSIs should be reported to appropriate institutional officials (as required by [CONTACT_17347]’s 
written reporting procedures), the NIH MO  (or designee), and the Office for Human Research 
Protections ( OHRP ) within 30 business days  of the IRB’s review and determination that the 
report of th e prob lem from the investigator imposed a safety risk.  
 
8.4.[ADDRESS_374130] of this 
therapy on  persistent HIV -1 infection. All eligible participants will receive the same treatment which 
includes  two (2) VRC07 -523LS infusions  and twenty ( 20) doses of VOR 400 mg . Participants will 
continue their baseline ART regimen  throughout the study.   
 
 
9.1 STATISTICAL HYPOTHES ES 
 
Hypothesis  
Combination therapy with VRC07 -523LS administered by [CONTACT_305710] 400mg orally will be safe and well tolerated.  
 
9.2 SAMPLE SIZE  DETERMINATION  
 
We will enroll up to 12 fully evaluable  participants  (who receive two cycle s of VRC07 -523LS and VOR) 
to examine the effect of addi ng VOR and VRC07 -523LS to ART on persistent replication -competent 
HIV within resting CD4+ T cells.  
 
Any participant who does not complete both series of VRC07 -523LS and VOR and the leukapheresis in 
Step 4 for reasons other than a grade 3 or higher  AE will be replaced, to ensure up to 12 evaluable 
participants for safety.  
 
Since t he trial will be stopped if two participants experience a study treatment -related toxicity of Grade 
3 or higher, the criterion  for safety is grade 3  or higher toxicity in no more than 1  of 12 participants in 
the study . 
 
For n=[ADDRESS_374131] 95% 1 -sided upper confidence limit 
(UCL) for the true AE rate will be 0.22. Thus, if no AEs are  observed, one can confidently rule out event 
rates greater than 22%.   
The VOR -07 Study  Version 4.0  
Protocol: IGHID [ADDRESS_374132] one dose of study therapy will contribute to the safety analysis of 
this study . 
 
9.4 STATISTICAL ANALYSES  
 
9.4.1 GENERAL APPROACH  
 
We plan a phase I , single -center study in participants with HIV -1 infection who are receiving ART. 
Baseline ART will be maintained throughout the study. HIV -1 infected participants with plasma HIV RNA  
stably below the limit of quantitation  will be screened . After meeting all eligibility criteria and 
enrollment, all participants will undergo an initial evaluation of resting CD4+T cells  obtained via 
leukapheresis . A baseline measurement of the frequency of HIV -1 infection per million units (IUPM) in 
resting CD4+ cells will be performed by [CONTACT_305711].  
 
In Step 2 , all participants will receive one (1) IV infusion of VRC07 -523LS  40mg/kg , followed by [CONTACT_134218] (10) 
doses of VOR [ADDRESS_374133] cycle of a single VRC07 -523LS 40mg/kg  infusion  
followed by [CONTACT_134218] ( 10) doses of VOR 400 mg PO every  72 hour s is repeated in Step 3.  Therefore all 
participants will receive a total of 2 IV infusions of VRC07 -523LS and 20 doses of VOR 400mg PO over a 3 
month  period .  Participants completing this protocol will receive no more than a total of 8, 000 mg of 
VOR . For reference, participants who completed a  prior multi- dose study (58)  received a total of 10,[ADDRESS_374134] dose of VOR  
to measure the frequency of HIV -1 infection (IUPM) by [CONTACT_305711] . 
 
Each participant will be followed for approximately [ADDRESS_374135] of this study, and will 
be reviewed by [CONTACT_305712] (SMC). If an interim analysis has not yet 
been performed, the C ommittee will perform a preli minary review of accumulated safety data afte r [ADDRESS_374136] series of combined treatment with VRC07 -523LS and 10 doses of 
VOR . This review will be based on assessment of participant safety, and will serve as a basis for allowing 
enrollment to continue. The Committee also will oversee all subsequent analyses.

 9.4.2 ANALYSIS OF THE PRIM ARY SAFETY ENDPOINT  
 
Safety:   
For the primary safety analysis, AEs  attributed to study treatment will be described through the end of 
study visit  approximately  [ADDRESS_374137] one dose of study treatment  will be included in this analysis.  
 
Since the trial will  be paused for SMC review if two participants experience a study treatment- related 
toxicity of Grade  3 or higher, the criterion for safety of this study is grade 3 or 4 toxicity in no more than 
1 of 12 participants.  
 
 
9.4.3 ANALYSIS OF THE OTHER ENDPOINT(S)  
 
Other Activity Endpoints:  
• Change in the frequency  of HIV infection per million resting CD4+T cells (RCI) from baseline to 
after treatment with VRC07 -523LS and VOR  
 
We will analyze pre -VOR/VRC07 -523LS and post - VOR/VRC07 -523LS frequency of HIV infection 
per million resting CD4+T cells using a non -parametric [ADDRESS_374138] ( supplemented by 
[CONTACT_305713] ) to determine whether 
or not a significant decrease of IUPM is observed. With  12 participants , there will be  80% power 
to reject H 0 (cha nge expected with ART alone) in favor of H A (greater change than expected with 
ART) if the true probability of observing a decrease in IUPM in a participant after VOR/VRC07 -
523LS is 0.93.   
 
This is based on a 2 -sided alpha = 0.05 and the assumption that o bserved HIV infection 
frequency would decrease with probability 0.54 on ART alone after 6  months without 
intervention, based on the decay of IUPM seen on ART alone [Crooks 2015, Siliciano 2003].  
 
In addition to summarizing the number and proportion of participants who show decrease in 
IUPM after VOR/VRC07 -523LS, we will describe the magnitude of the changes in decrease in 
IUPM after VOR/VRC07 -523LS via the median fold -change and corresponding 95% c onfidence 
interval. We will also summarize the proportion of participants with >6 -fold decreases; this 
magnitude change is rarely seen in participants on stable ART [9].  
  
Other  Endpoints: Activity  
• HIV-1 RNA by [CONTACT_305714]07 -523LS and VOR  
 
The virologic analysis will include estimation of the low level viremia levels at pre-treatment 
(screening and entry) and separately at  post -treatment. We assume that the probability would 
be 0.10 (10%) for  a baseline (pre -entry, entry) detectable low level virem ia ≥ 1 copy . The 
assumption that 10% of participants with a quantifiable low level viremia at screening will have 
low level viremia assay below the limit of detection at a pre -treatment measure is an estimate 
based on data from A5244 in which 6 of 50 (12%) enrolled participants had undetectable low 
The VOR -07 Study  Version 4.0  
Protocol: IGHID [ZIP_CODE] 09 May 2019 
78 
 level of viremia at pre -entry and 5 of 51 (10%) at entry after having a screening low level of

• Following VOR/VRC07 -523LS we will also explore whether there is a depletion of rc -RNA using 
the same statistical tests in the reverse (compare baseline rc -RNA to after two cycles of 
VOR/VRC07 -523LS).  
 
• To assess these within each individual participant (n o f 1 analyses) , we will us e the non -
parametric [ADDRESS_374139] to determine whether or not a statistically significant 
change  in rc-RNA expression is observed, comparing rc -RNA levels measured in each of 24 -36 
replicate pools of 1 million resting CD4+ cells.  Pools with undetectable RNA will be considered as 
[ADDRESS_374140].  
 
The pre -VOR rc-RNA expression will be determined as the median RNA copi[INVESTIGATOR_305640] e million participant cells tested prior to VOR (setting undetectable RNA 
pools as 0 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]), and the post -VOR RNA expression level will be similarly determined. Changes 
in RNA expression will be evaluated by [CONTACT_305715]. Summaries of the magnitude of changes will be examined in 
terms of median fold -changes.   
 
• We will also explore changes in the chromosomally integrated viral reservoir as measured by Q -
PCR from baseline to post VOR/V RC07 -523LS.  
 
• We will also explore the change in frequency of viral envelope sequences detected in plasma or 
cells that are not recognized by [CONTACT_33805]07 -523LS from baseline to post  VOR/VRC07 -523LS.  
 
• A 0.05 significance level will be used throughout, with no adjustment for multiple testing given 
the proof of concept nature of this study. Emphasis will be put on estimation with 
corresponding 95% confidence intervals to evaluate the scientific and biolog ic effect size. 
Individual -level data will be visualized in plots. Given the small sample size, exploratory analyses 
will have limited or no statistical power and findings should be interpreted with caution and 
assessed in a subsequent, larger study if the  combined treatment is found to be safe and 
potentially efficacious. If the study is stopped at n= [ADDRESS_374141] infusion at Day 0.  AEs will be coded to the Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). Events prior to treatmen t (e.g., due to study -related 
procedure) will be listed separately in an appendix to the final clinical study report . The following tables 
of AE data will be created to summarize the number and percent of participants who experience at least 
one event of each of the following types:  
• All AEs  
• Drug- related AEs by [CONTACT_86953]  
• AEs by [CONTACT_305716] -07 Study  Version 4.0

 • All SAEs (this may be a listing if there are few events)  
• Drug- related SAEs  
• Fatal AEs (this may be a listing if there are few events)  
• AEs that result in study discontinuation  
• AEs that lead to withdrawal of study drug  
• AEs categorized as AESI and/or IREs  
• AEs with severity grade 3 or greater  
• Drug- related AEs with severity grade 3 or greater  
 
All of these tables will display the number and percent of participants th at experience the given event 
and will display events by [CONTACT_1196] (SOC) and Preferred Term (PT). Events will be displayed 
alphabetically for SOC and in descending order of overall PT incidence within each SOC.

completed, the de -identified, archived data will be stored in the UNC Cure Center Datab ase, for use by 
[CONTACT_305721]. Permission to transmit data to resea rchers outside the UNC HIV 
Cure Center Collaboratory will require review and approval by [CONTACT_206549]. In some circumstances, we 
will need to obtain additional consent from participants  to share samples collected for the purpose of 
this study.   
 
With the p articipant’s ap proval and as approved by [CONTACT_206549], de -identified biological samples will be 
stored at the UNC HIV Cure Center and/or the UNC Chapel Hill HIV/STD Laboratory Core. These samples 
could be used to research the causes of HIV cure for which individuals with HIV infection can greatly 
benefit.  The UNC HIV Cure Research Laboratories will also be provided with a code -link that will allow 
linking the biological specimens with the phenotypic data from each participant, maintaining the 
blinding of the identity of the participant.  
 
During the conduct of the study, an individual participant can choose to withdraw consent to have 
biological specimens stored for future research. However, withdrawal of consent with regard to 
biosample storage m ay not be possible after the study is completed.  
 
When the study is completed, access to study data and/or samples will be provided through the UNC

10.1.6  SAFETY OVERSIGHT  
 
Safety oversight will be under the direction of a Safety Monitoring Committee  (SMC) composed of 
individuals with the appropriate expertise, including  a Biostatistician and an HIV Therapy clinician . 
Members of the SMC are independent from the study conduct and free of conflict of inte rest.   
 
The SMC advises the study PI [INVESTIGATOR_305643] I study. The primary responsibility of the 
SMC is to monitor human subject safety. The SMC considers study -specific data as well as relevant 
background information about the disease, test agent s, and target population unde r study.  
 
During the trial the SMC will review:   
• Real- time and cumulative safety data for evidence of study -related adverse events;   
• Adherence to the protocol;  
• Factors that might affect the study outcome or compromise the trial data (such as protocol 
violations, losses to follow -up, etc.).  
• Review the achievement of enrollment benchmarks  
 
The SMC will receive monthly reports via email for review and comments. The SMC will be contact[CONTACT_305722] (and possibly via teleconferencing) for any event or situation that impacts participant 
safety throughout the study and specified interventions or study participation will be suspended or  
terminated  dependent on the response of the SMC.  
Safety Pause  
Administration of the study products and new enrollments  will be paused by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_305644]:  
 
a) Two or more participants experience a primary safety outcome measure that is a Grade ≥3 
AE possibly related to study treatment (other than self -limited Grade 3 solicited 
reactogenicity AEs) ; or  
 
b) One (or more) participant experiences a Serious Adverse Event (SAE) that is assessed  as 
related to study product.  
 
In the event of a pause, the Study Monitoring Committee (SMC) will be asked to review all safety data.   
Review will include the relation to study treatment of the event(s) thought by [CONTACT_305723] a 
primary safety outcome. In the event of a pause,  the FDA (IND) and the DAIDS Medical Officer (MO) will 
be promptly notified.   
 
The VOR -07 Study  Version 4.0  
Protocol: IGHID [ADDRESS_374145] administrations and study 
enrollments. The reviews to make this decisi on will occur as follows:  
• Pauses for treatment- related SAEs: The DAIDS MO and the PI [INVESTIGATOR_305645], amend , or close the study and will notify 
the IRB accordingly.  
• Pauses for Grade 3 or highe r treatment -related AEs: The DAIDS MO, with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_305646] (SMC), will conduct the review and make the decision to resume, amend , 
or close the study for the Grade 3 or higher AEs that meet criteria for pausing the study. As part  
of the pause review, the reviewers will also advise on whether the study needs to be paused 
again for any subsequent events of the same type. The FDA and the IRB will be notified of Grade 
3 or higher pause reviews and of the study protocol team decision.  
 
 
10.1.7  CLINICAL MONITORING  
 
To ensure the safety of participants in the study, compliance with applicable regulations, and to ensure 
accurate, complete, and reliable data, the study PI [INVESTIGATOR_305647], clinical notes, 
and participant medical records in the participant files as source documents for the study.  
 
An independent study monitor will monitor the study on a regular basis throughout the study period 
according to the study monitoring plan. The study P I (or designee) will allocate adequate time for such 
monitoring activities. The study monitor periodically will conduct a review of a sample of the participant 
data recorded on source documents at the study site. The study PI  (or designee) will also ensure that the 
monito r is given access to all the above noted study -related documents, source documents (regardless 
of media) , and study -related facilities (e.g., IDS pharmacy, etc.), and has adequate space to conduct the 
monitoring visit. Queries may be raised if any datum is  unclear or contradictory. The study P I and site 
study personnel must address all queries in a timely manner.  
 
Participation as an Investigator in this study implies acceptance of the potential for inspection by [CONTACT_305724] /Funder and its Representatives, US or non -US government regulatory authorities, IRB, 
and applicable compliance and quality assurance offices. The study P I (or designee) will permit study -
related audits and inspections and will provide access to all study -related documents (e.g., so urce 
documents, regulatory documents, data collection instruments, study data, etc.). The study P I will 
ensure the capability for inspections of applicable study -related facilities (e.g., IDS  pharmacy, CTRC, 
etc.).  
 
Minimiz ing risk to participants  
 
Procedures to minimize risk to participants in the conduct of this study include: 1) informing participants 
about risks so they can recognize and report harms in partnership with the study team; 2) respecting 
local/national blood draw limits; 3) direct obs ervation of participants after study treatment 
administration with VRC07 -523LS and collection of information regarding side effects for several days 
post product administration; 4) having study staff properly trained in administering study procedures 
that may cause physical harm or psychologic distress, such as blood draws and infusions; and 5) 
providing study monitoring.

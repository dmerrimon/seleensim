71.0 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE
1.1 Disease Background
Localized Prostate Cancer
There is estimated to be 238,590 new cases of prostate cancer diagnosed in the
[LOCATION_002] in 2013 and 29,720 deaths [1].  Among males, prostate carcinoma
was the 2ndleading cause of cancer mortality behind lung cancer. About 60% of
prostate cancer are diagnose din men age 65 or older which impacts therapy
options as a result of competing co -morbidities. With introduction of PSA
screening, majority of prostate cancer is diagnosed in organ confined disease [2].
Radiotherapy options for organ confined prostate cancer have included
protracted radiation in the form of external beam delivered over 7 -10 weeks of
daily therapy (including 2 -D, 3-D confor mal, and intensity modulated radiation
therapy or IMRT) [3-5]and also permanent brachytherapy seed implantation
using iodine or palladium [6-8].  Treatments have also been delivered using
shorter overall treatment times.  These include hypofractiona ted external beam
treatments and high dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy implants [9-12].  In addition,
studies using extreme hypofractionated approach including stereotactic body
radiation therapy (SBRT)/Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy (SABR) have
emerged, including the phase I/II study completed here at UT Southwester n[13,
14]. In addition to being more convenient for patients with fewer trips to the
treatment facilities, these treatment options completed over a shorter p eriod have
unique long term effects in both tumor and normal tissues.  Depending on the
relative differences between tumor response and normal tissue injury, the timing
in which radiotherapy is delivered may have significant impact on the therapeutic
ratio (benefit/toxicity).  A commonly used mathematical model used to describe
these effects has been the “linear -quadratic” model proposed by [CONTACT_646709] [15].  In this model, the log survival vs. dose relationship is modeled by [CONTACT_646710].  The linear
coefficient in this progression is commonly called “alpha” while the quadratic
coefficient is cal led “beta.”  It has also been proposed that the linear term
described by [CONTACT_646711]. In turn, the beta term reflects the
consequence of more than one single strand break in close enough proximity on
the DNA to disable the cell.  These single strand breaks occur much more
frequently than double strand breaks, but they may be more readily repaired
unless they happen so frequently that repair mechanisms become overwhelmed
such as might occur with large dose per fraction radiation.  Hence, at low dose
per fraction, alpha events dominate the cellular response while at large dose per
fraction, beta events become more important.  These events occur, at different
rates and proportions, in both tumor and normal tissues exposed to radiation.
It has been commonplace to describe tissue response properties of various
tissues toward radiation by [CONTACT_646712].  The alpha and beta values
may be measured invitro by [CONTACT_646713].  Normal tissues, more capable of repairing radiation
injury, typi[INVESTIGATOR_44769] a lower alpha/beta ratio in the order of [ADDRESS_865823] alpha/beta
ratios in the 10 range.  For such tumors, exploitation of the differences between
normal tissue and tumor response has led radiation oncologists to use more
protracted courses of radiation using small daily doses to high total cumulat ive
doses (so -called conventional fractionation, e.g., 2 Gy per fraction to a total dose
of 70 -76 Gy).  Prostate cancer cell lines have been difficult to grow in tissue
culture and therefore there has been less direct evidence of the alpha/beta ratio.
STU [ADDRESS_865824] leading to the conventional dose
fractionation schedules used in clinical practice or the low dose rate implants
used in permanent prostate se ed brachytherapy.  More recent evidence,
however, has implied that the alpha/beta ratio for prostate cancer may be much
lower than expected.  In fact, using outcome data of patients treated with
different dose fractionation schemes (in vivo), it has been s uggested that the
alpha/beta ratio for prostate cancer may be as low as 1.[ADDRESS_865825] been
published, including the Australian trial comparing 64 Gy in 32 fractions versus
55 Gy in 20 fractions in men with favorable risk prostate cancer [16]. Biochemical
outcomes were not different, and toxicity was similar, except for increased rectal
bleeding in the hypofractionated arm.  Another study compared 66 Gy in 33
fracti ons versus 52.5 Gy in 20 fractions [17].  While the outcome seem to favor
the longer fractionation, the study was not adequately designed to address this
question as the biologically effective dose of the hypofractionated arm was less
than the conventional fractionation arm.  In the US, Kupelian and colleagues
used 2.5 Gy per fraction and published mature results to 70 Gy total dose in 5.5
weeks [18].  Their patients had good PSA control rates and acceptable rates of
toxicity, especially if the volume rectum getting 70 Gy is limited to 10 cc.
Altogether, these trials show that the treatmen t can be delivered much more
quickly and conveniently using equivalent effective doses with hypofractionation
without compromising PSA control or significant toxicity so long as careful
technique and normal tissue dose tolerance is respected.  Furthermore,
investigation of hypofractionated strategies for the high risk patients is under
investigation. For example, a randomized phase III study using hypofractionated
strategy in high risk prostate cancer patients has been reported where 62 Gy/[ADDRESS_865826] 80 Gy/40 fractions [19].  Interestingly, 62 Gy in
20 fractions converts to roughly 48.1 Gy in 5 fractions [20].
1.2 Study Agent(s) Background and Associated Known Toxicities
1.2.1 Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT)/Stereotactic Ablat ive
Radiotherapy (SABR)
‘Stereotactic radiosurgery’ generally refers to a procedure design to treat deep -
seated brain tumors or abnormalities, and is commonly performed on a
specialized machine, such as the Gamma Knife.  This procedure involves
immobilizing the patient (cranial h alo), affixing a stable 3 -D coordinate system
(fiducial box and head frame), performing high resolution imaging (CT or MRI),
registering the images to the coordinate system using a computer, virtually
simulating delivery of very focal and conformal dose pr ofiles of radiation with
steep dose gradients toward normal tissue, and finally carrying out the treatment
with sub -millimeter accuracy.  Typi[INVESTIGATOR_424387] (15 -40 Gy)
are given in a single treatment with this technique.  Any adjacent n ormal tissues
that receive this dose may be significantly damaged, thus the requirement for
very conformal treatments with rapid dose fall -off.  An alternate strategy has
been to divide total radiation dose into two or three fractions, still with fairly la rge
dose per fraction (6 -10 Gy), attempting to decrease adjacent normal tissue
toxicity.  These fractionated techniques are referred to as ‘stereotactic
radiotherapy,’ and are carried out with hope that surrounding normal tissue will
tolerate the treatment as a result of relatively more successful sublethal damage
repair as compared to tumor.
Translation of the stereotactic radiosurgery and radiotherapy concepts to
extracranial sites has not been straightforward [21-23].  With brain treatments,
STU [ADDRESS_865827] structures amenable to rigid fixation to a frame.  In 1994, Lax, et al,
from the Karolinska Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_646672] t he development and testing
of an extracranial frame that incorporated a fiducial stereotactic coordinate
system along its side panels [23].  The system used vacuum pi[INVESTIGATOR_646673] (maximizing surface area of co ntact) and
correlation of external anatomical reference points on the sternum and calf for
immobilization.  To decrease respi[INVESTIGATOR_367117], an abdominal press was
employed forcing the patient to perform relatively more chest wall rather than
diaphragmat ic breathing.  A formal verification of reproducibility study was carried
out, and target motion was reduced to within 0.[ADDRESS_865828] and 1.0 cm
in the caudal/cephalad plane.  With this degree of accuracy (compared to 0.05
cm target position acc uracy for the Gamma Knife), stereotactic radiosurgery
could not be performed; however, they did set up a program treating patients with
extracranial stereotactic radiotherapy.
Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT)/ Stereotactic ablative radiotherapy
(SABR) is a new therapeutic paradigm for treating localized tumors outside of the
central nervous system and involves delivering very high doses of focused
radiation using unique beam arrangements and special immobilization equipment
[24].  As already demonstrated in lung and liver cancers, these treatments offer
hope for improved loca l control of cancers that may translate into gains in
survival especially for smaller early stage lesions.  SABR employs daily treatment
doses dramatically higher than typi[INVESTIGATOR_646674] (CFRT).  In turn, it is incorr ect to assume that SABR radiobiology is
similar to historical CFRT.  Indeed, a unique biology of radiation response for
very large dose per fraction treatments is being appreciated both in terms of
tumor control as well as normal tissue consequences transl ating into unique
clinical outcomes.  For example, local control with CFRT in early stage lung
cancer is consistently reported below 50% while several series using SABR show
local control around 90% [25,26].
SABR has been defined by [CONTACT_38978] (ACR) and
American Society of Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology (ASTRO) to involve
the use of very large dose per fraction [27].  Indeed, dose per fraction of 8 Gy
minimum would obviously make SABR very different from even the more
abbreviated hypofractionation schemes described above.  Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], only 1 -5
fractions are used for SABR depending on the tolerance of adjacent or
intervening normal tissues.  Linear structures (like the spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831]) and tubular
structures (like the bowels) are commonly called “serially functioning tissues”
akin to series electrical circuits because their function is disrupted if there is a
defect anywher e along their pathways [28,29].  It has been shown that serial
functioning tissues are less tolerant to SABR than so -called “parallel functioning
tissues” like the peripheral lung and liver.  In response, typi[INVESTIGATOR_646675] (e.g., five fractions rather than one) when serially functioning tissue
cannot be avoided.  In the case of treating prostate cancer, the rectum is an
adjacent serially functioning tissue while the urethra is an intervening seri ally
functioning tissue traversing the very center of the prostate target.
STU [ADDRESS_865829] dose tolerances as defined in our
analysis.  This has also been the case in world of conventional fractionation
radiation therapy, where determination of rectal dose constraints (specifically,
limiting volume of rectum receiving 70 Gy in 2 Gy/daily fraction dose) by [INVESTIGATOR_456126]’s
group has provided a means of dose escalating radiation treatments without
increasing rectal toxicity [32].
When using such high dose per fraction, as is the case in SABR, three strategies
for improve rectal dose can be considered.  One strategy is to de -escalate the
total dose significantly (6 -6.5 Gy/fracti on).  While this lower dose may prove to be
effective for treatment of localized prostate cancer, and would certainly reduce
toxicity, as has been the case with other institution’s experience [14], the follow up
data from these institutions remain short, and if the alpha beta ratio hypothesis
proves to be inaccurate, then we may be subjecting patients to s uboptimal
therapy.  Furthermore, such lower doses are likely to be less effective in patients
with more aggressive, high risk prostate cancer.  Dose escalation has proved to
be important in high risk prostate cancer even using conventional fractionation
strategies, and suggestion of importance of considering hypofractionation for
high risk prostate cancer was demonstrated in phase III randomized study from
Italy[19], suggesting that dose de -escalation strategies would limit our ability to
treat higher risk prostate cancer patients with SABR.
Second strategy is to continue to explore radioprotec tors to try to reduce toxicity.
However, a suitable radioprotector drug, particularly when using SABR treatment
has not yet been discovered.  Third strategy is to consider methods to reduce
dose to the rectum via physical or dosimetric means.  In the case of
conventionally fractionated treatments, sophisticated treatment planning using
intensity modulated radiation therapy or 3D conformal therapy has allowed rectal
dose parameters to be respected to a point of acceptable rectal toxicity risks.
However, in the case of SABR, avoidance of such high doses with sophisticated
treatment planning using our parameters, though feasible in most cases, may
remain significantly challenging in patients with unfavorable anatomy.
Therefore, another potential strategy t o improve dosimetry has been developed
recently.  This involves the use of an anatomic modulating strategy to distance
the anterior rectum from the prostate in order to reduce dose to the rectum.  This
approach is now being investigated both in conventiona l fractionated radiation
therapy and in SABR for prostate cancer patients, and involve the use of an
injectable rectal spacers [33-38].  These spacers would likely be particularly
effective at reducing the high dose associated with vascular/stromal injury an d
will likely lead to significant reduction of high grade rectal toxicity events. It
should also improve acute lower grade events, as such events also will likely be
mitigated if we can limit the 24 Gy dose/5 fractions to treate < 50% of rectal
circumferen ce. Multiinstitutional clinical trial of rectal spacers ability to improve
dosimetric parameters when using conventional intensity modulated radiation
therapy has been completed with positive outcome [39]further supporting use of
this strategy.  This same group has recently published safety profile of use of this
spacer for conventional IMRT based radiation therapy for prostate cancer [40].
Effectiveness in reducing acute toxicity using another rectal spacer for
brachytherapy/IMRT application has been reported in abstract form [41].  Its
safety/efficacy in SABR has not yet been established.

111.4 Rationale
Stereotactic Body Radiation therapy (SBRT)/ Stereotactic ablative body radiation
therapy (SABR) in Localized Prostate Cancer.
Studies using SBRT/SABR approaches for extreme hypofractionation to reduce
further treatment time, convenience, and possibly treatment efficacy,  has been
performed at multiple institutions including ours [13,14,30,31].  We were the
first institution to perform a multiinstitutional phase I dose escalation study which
was completed successfully.  This study included cohorts of 15 patients per dose
group with doses escalated from 45 Gy 47.5 Gy 50 Gy in 5 fractions. In the
phase I study at the 45 Gy dose (9Gy x 5 fractions) arm, first ten patients
underwent anoscopic evaluation by [CONTACT_3449] P.I. (R.T.) at 6, 12, 24, and [ADDRESS_865830] SABR.  10/10 (100%) patients were found to have development of a small
ulcer in the anterior rectum adjacent to the prostate, which was mostly
asymptomatic.  This mucosal lesion shrunk in size and disappeared in all [ADDRESS_865831] therapy ({Kim, 2014 #203} and personal
communication, R. Timmerman).
Using 90 day tox icity as the endpoint for dose escalation, acute toxicity at 50 Gy
was found to be tolerable [13], and we proceeded to treat additional patients in
phase II studying late toxicity using that dose.  An unacceptable 6.6 % (6/61) of
patients treated developed high grade rectal toxicity, 5 of whom required
colostomy {Kim, 2014 #203}.  The data from these patients were analyzed to
determine clinical and radiation dose parameters that may have been related to
such high grade toxic event. We found that  Grade 3+ delayed rectal toxicity felt
related to vascular/stromal damage was strongly correlated with volume of rectal
wall receiving 50 Gy (V50) > 3 cm3(p=.002), and treatment of > 35%
circumference of rectal wall to 39 Gy (p=.03) related to stem cell eradication.
Grade 2+ acute rectal toxicity felt related to stem cell depletion was significantly
correlated with treatment of > 50% circumference of rectal wall to 24 Gy (p=.006)
{Kim, 2014 #203}.
1.4.1 Current Protocol
Prostate cancer has several good treatment options for organ confined disease
such as surgery and conventional radiation.  In ad dition, some men with indolent
disease are appropriately treated with watchful waiting.  However, all of the
established treatments continue to fail in a portion of patients via tumor
recurrence.  Furthermore, current treatments are often unpalatable for m any
patients because they are either too invasive or too inconvenient.  It has also
been shown recently that higher risk prostate cancers may be better controlled
using large dose per fraction treatments such as might be delivered by
[CONTACT_646714] (SBRT/SABR) [19]. However, the results of
our phase I/II study clearly demonstrates that on long term follow up delayed
rectal toxicity events can occur, but this is likely preventable if we can respect
rectal tolerance by [CONTACT_122965] r adiation dose to the rectal wall.  In addition to
having rectal tolerance parameters defined from our previous study, which we
will incorporate to this study, there are now rectal spacers made from
polyethyleneglycol hydrogel material available for use [33-38,40,41]. These
spacers are designed for stability for up to 1 -3 months, which will allow for
stability of anatomy during the SABR treatment phase.
We plan to perform a phase II study to assess safety and efficacy of the spacer
injection process, ability of the spacer to effectively provide the space necessary
to reduce acute events in the rectum, and also meet the SABR based rectal
constraints, and t o monitor stability of this process during SABR.  Unlike IMRT,
which uses smaller dose/fraction, when using such high dose/fraction, even a
few mm of shift in spacer positioning may impact the dose that the rectum
receives, and therefore, a rigorous study of stability of material during the SABR
STU [ADDRESS_865832] eligibility
criteria of low and inter mediate risk patients to minimize risk of extraprostatic
spread, seminal vesicle invasion, and nodal spread.  Hormonal therapy may also
be used to shrink prostates that are massively enlarged as this may also help
further reduce length of rectum that will be irradiated.  As the primary toxicity will
likely be mucosal damage, we will avoid enrolling patients with pre -existing
mucosal dysfunction (including those with previous radiation, TURP, very large
prostate glands, inflammatory bowel disease) and immuno suppressed individuals
based on our phase I experience [13].  In this way, patients wi ll be uniformly
selected in a fashion that would identify patients likely to receive benefit from the
therapy.
Based on our phase I/II experience, we will select 9 Gy/fraction with a total of [ADDRESS_865833] been
extremely effective at controlling the prostate cancer. With a median f/u of 25.5
months (range 1 -68.4m), at last analysis, PSA control remains at 99%. Given
there will be only 5 treatments, daily enemas, rectal tubes, and even urethral
catheters for simulation are all feasible undertakings which were well tolerated,
and found to be helpful for optimizing setup and the therapy.
1.4.2 Who Would Benefit from this Treatment?
As noted above, there are several quite good but not perfect treatments for organ
confined prostate cancer that have significant follow -up and published
experience as well as an option for watchful waiting.  Still, there are populations
that might find the invasiveness of surgery and brachytherapy implants less ideal
and the inconvenience of IMRT and [ADDRESS_865834] be a better option for some men with
prostate cancer. High risk patients benefit by [CONTACT_646715] o f the
treatment, and may also require doses higher than what can be delivered safely
with this approach (based on our phase I/II data, and other institutional
experiences as noted above).  These patients are in need of better therapy, and
higher dose SABR approach may prove to be an important therapeutic gain for
this group of patients.  Furthermore, findings of our study will have further clinical
ramifications beyond prostate cancer. It will be applicable to design of studies of
tumor sites in close proxi mity to bowel structures in general, where higher SABR
doses are being contemplated due to perceived clinical needs as such tumors
may not share the same alpha beta ratio as prostate cancer does.  Development
of an effective paradigm for spacer placement t o displace critical structures
reliably away from the high dose region may lead to design of additional spacer
studies in other anatomical sites.

132.0 STUDY OBJECTIVES
2.1 Primary Objectives
2.1.1 To reduce acute periprostatic rectal ulcer events from 90%+ to < 70%
(particularly in the anterior rectum)
2.1.2 To establish rates of creation of >= 7.5 mm space (anticipated to be 95%
[39]).
This is to determine if use of rectal spacers are effective at improving protection
of rectum from high dose radiation, using rate of rectal ulceration as a surrogate
measure of acute effects. It is also to determine whether it provides sufficient
dosimetric benefits to warrant further clinical investigation in future SABR related
clinical studies.
2.2 Secondary Objectives
Secondary objective is to determine radiation related toxicity outcomes in the
acute and delayed setting, as well as to follow PSA control.  HRQOL will be
measured as part of current clinical practice, and not necessarily related to this
treatment protocol.
2.2.1 Assess for spacer related acute toxicity. Spacer related toxicity could be
related to the procedure itself (bleeding, infection, pain), or secondary
effects of spacer (erectile dysfunction, persistent pain and discomfort).
2.2.2 Determine spacer’s ability to decrease percent rectal circumference
(PRC) receiving [ADDRESS_865835] 50%.
2.2.3Assess for acute (within 270 days of treatment) and chronic (>270 days
from treatment) SABR -related genitourinary (GU) and gastrointestinal
(GI) toxicitie s, as well as non -GU/GI toxicities during follow up.
2.2.4Assess oncologic outcomes, including biochemical recurrence, overall
survival, disease -specific survival, rates of local/regional/distant relapse
2.2.5Assess effect on quality of life (QOL)
2.3 Endpoints
2.3.1 Primary Endpoint
The primary endpoint of this study is to determine whether use of a rectal spacer
withSABR will decrease the rate of rectal toxicity when performing SABR
treatments for prostate cancer ,and the effectiveness of space creation by [CONTACT_646716].  To this extent, our primary objectives are
to measure rectal mucosal ulceration rate, and
to determine ability of spacer to create >=7.5 mm space: rate of
space creation of >=7.5mm .
2.3.2 Secondary Endpoints
To assess spacer related acute toxicity, defined as toxicities
occurring in the two week period between spacer placement and
start of radiation treatment.
To determine spacer’s efficacy as measured by [CONTACT_646717] [ADDRESS_865836] 50%.  This will be
determined by [CONTACT_646718].

164.0 TREATMENT PLAN
4.1 Treatment Dosage and Administration
RADIATION THERAPY
4.1.1 Dose Specifications
[IP_ADDRESS] Stereotactic Targeting and Treatment
The term “stereotactic” for the purposes of this protocol implies the targeting, planning, and
directing of therapy using beams of radiation along any trajectory in [ADDRESS_865842] skin marks or bony landmarks and assumed to correlate to
the actual tumor target based on a historical simulation.  It should be understood that
Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT/SAB R) has become a treatment that is well
beyond just stereotactic targeting.   Indeed SABR is mostly about ablative range dose per
fraction, accounting properly for errors including motion, careful construction of dosimetry that
compacts high dose into the t umor and not normal tissues, and extra careful treatment conduct.
This protocol will require treatments to be conducted with the use of a fixed 3 -D coordinate
system defined by [CONTACT_424446].  The coordinate system defined by [CONTACT_646720] (e.g., couch and gantry) in a reproducible and secure
fashion.   Capability should exist to define the position of targets within the patient according to
this same [ADDRESS_865843] an isocenter or target according to the known 3 -D
coordinates as determined in the process of treatment planning.  The nature of the fiducials
themselves may include radio -opaque markers or rods placed at known locations in a frame or
fixed structure adjacent to the patient as well as use of the tumor itself as a fiducial (e.g.
acquiring tomographic views of the tumor simultaneously with the treatment).  Metallic “seeds”
or marker s placed within the tumor will be allowed so long as they are not prone to migration
movement.
[IP_ADDRESS] Dose Fractionation
Patients will receive 5 fractions of radiation.  A minimum of 36 hours and a maximum of 8 days
should separate each treatment.  No more than 3 fractions will be delivered per week (7
consecutive days).  Total dose will be 45 Gy.
[IP_ADDRESS] Premedications
Unless contraindicated, it is recommended that all patients receive corticosteroid premedication
(e.g. Decadron 4 mg p.o. in a single dose, or equivalent) 15 -60 minutes prior to each of the five
treatments for the intended purpose of modulating immediate acute inflammatory effects. It is
strongly recommended that all patients be treated prophylactically with drugs intended to avoid
urina ry retention associated with SABR.  This class of drugs include alpha blockers (e.g.,
tamsulosin aka Flomax, doxazosin aka Cardura, terazosin aka Hytrin, etc) and 5 -alpha
reductase inhibitors (e.g., finasteride aka Proscar, dutasteride aka Avodart, etc), o r drugs with
similar intended effect.  It is recommended to start the therapy at least one day prior o the first
SABR treatment and continue for [ADDRESS_865844] doses for obstructive indicati ons, and contraindications to these drugs
should be respected.  Analgesic premedication, such as Tylenol 650 mg 30 minutes prior to
therapy and as needed every 6 hours, to avoid general discomfort during long treatment
durations also is recommended when ap propriate.
[IP_ADDRESS] Supportive medicines
Consider Tamsulosin (e.g., Flomax) during treatment period to reduce urinary symptoms.
Consider using 5 -alpha reductase inhibitor like Finasteride (e.g. Proscar) to relieve potential
obstructive issues.  For both drugs, standard doses will be utilized as needed unless
contraindicated. Also consider 1 tablespoon of Milk of Magnesia, taken the night before
simulation/treatment ( Note: Inform patient that this will cause diarrhea ). Fleet’s enema should
be taken 2 hrs ,before simulation/treatment. An antibiotic (Bactrim or similar) may be prescribed
to alleviate UTI if necessary.  This should be taken at standard doses as needed.

174.1.2 Technical Factors
[IP_ADDRESS] Physical Factors
Only photon (x -ray) beams produced by [CONTACT_533071], betatrons, or microtron
accelerators with photon energies 6 -21 MV will be allowed.  Cobalt -60 and charged particle
beams (including electrons, protons, and heavier ions) are not allowed.
[IP_ADDRESS] Dose Verification/Rectal Dose Verification at Treatment
Personal dosimeter measurements (e.g. diode, TLD, etc.) may be obtained for surface dose
verification for accessible beams. This information is not required by [CONTACT_760].
4.1.3 Localization, Simul ation, and Immobilization
[IP_ADDRESS] Patient Positioning
Patients will be positioned supi[INVESTIGATOR_105683] a stable position capable of allowing accurate
reproducibility of the target position from treatment to treatment.  Positions uncomfortable for
the patient should be avoided so as to prevent uncontrolled movement during treatments.  A
variety of immobilization systems may be utilized including stereotactic frames that surround
the patient on three sides and large rigid pi[INVESTIGATOR_50151] (conforming to patients external contou rs) with
reference to the stereotactic coordinate system (see Section 6.1). Patient immobilization must
be reliable enough to insure that the Gross Tumor Volume (GTV) does not deviate beyond the
confines of the Planning Treatment Volume (PTV) as defined in Section 6.4 with any significant
probability (i.e., < 5%).
[IP_ADDRESS] Inhibition of Effects of Internal Organ Motion
Special considerations must be made to account for the effect of internal organ motion (i.e.,
breathing, etc.) on target positioning and rep roducibility.  In some cases, the intrafractional
tumor motion is small and no special maneuvers are required to achieve motion limits as
defined in section 6.4 (this may be true for many cases of prostate cancer).  Treating in the
prone position will acce ntuate internal organ motion problems related to breathing and should
be avoided unless special measures are taken to account for this motion.  When accounting for
intrafractional motion, acceptable maneuvers including reliable abdominal compression,
accel erator beam gating with the respi[INVESTIGATOR_50126], and active breath -holding techniques.
Internal organ inhibition maneuvers must be reliable enough to insure that the Gross Tumor
Volume (GTV) does not deviate beyond the confines of the Planning Treatment Volu me (PTV)
as defined in Section 6.4 with any significant probability (i.e., < 5%).  Assessment of this motion
will be left to the institution and may includ eidentifying the position of radio -opaque seeds
implanted into the prostate prior to each treatment. This type of interfractional motion analysis
with correction is only required by [CONTACT_424449].  Intrafraction
assessment during the course of each treatment (dynamic and adaptive maneuvers) is allowed
and encouraged espe cially if treatment times are long.  Based on our prior experience, we do
not anticipate significant issues with adequately controlling for inter and intrafractional motion
using our setup techniques, including pretreatment enema.
[IP_ADDRESS] Localization and treatment maneuvers
A more direct method of localization of the prostate gland than conventional treatment (i.e., one
that uses skin and boney landmarks solely as a surrogate to the prostate position) must be
used in this protocol.  Acceptable methods wou ld include daily ultrasound or placing a radio -
opaque seed or marker that can be visualized and triangulated using dual  imaging or markers
that emit a signal that can be used to detect position electronically ,all placed prior to simulation
and planning.  Also, it would be acceptable to perform computed tomography such as axial,
spi[INVESTIGATOR_646677].  Image quality should b e good enough to identify the prostate borders.
In addition to the identification of the prostate in the preceding paragraph, the rectum should
also be identified.  We will perform daily enemas prior to each treatment. Prior to positioning at
least 30 min utes and no more than 2 hours before each treatment, patients should undergo an
effective bowel evacuation.  Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], this will involve 1 -2Fleet’s enemas. This maneuver is to
clear the rectum of stool and significant gas accumulation.

18Isocenter port localization films (anterior/posterior and lateral) should be obtained at each
treatment on the treatment unit (or patients should undergo a tomographic imaging study
utilizing the linear accelerator couch, if available) immediately before treatment to ens ure
proper alignment of the geometric center (i.e., isocenter) of the simulated fields.   Verification
CT scans and portal films may be taken at the discretion of the participating institution, but are
not required for protocol participation.
4.1.4 Treatm ent Planning/Target Volumes
[IP_ADDRESS] Image Acquisition
Computed Tomography (CT) will be the primary image platform for targeting and treatment
planning.  The planning CT scans must allow simultaneous view of the patient anatomy and
fiducial system for ster eotactic targeting.  Treatment planning images should be performed in
the treatment position using all aids/maneuvers described above including urethral tube,
bladder contrast, urethrogram, and rectal evacuation with enemas.  The treatment planning
scans may use a small caliber radio -opaque urethral catheter to allow visualization of the
prostatic urethra as it will be a high dose spi[INVESTIGATOR_646678] 6.4.2 below. Alternatively, MRI delineation or uret hrogram may be used.
Axial acquisitions with gantry 0 degrees will be required with spacing ≤ 3.[ADDRESS_865845] simulation (scan #1) will involve all of
the above procedures, and will be performed prior to rectal spacer placement.  The patient will
then undergo rectal spacer placement, and return for repeat simulation (scan #2) under exact
same cond ition as above.
Image fusion with other imaging modalities such as MRI that might be useful in delineating the
target and normal tissues will be performed. T2 MRI sequence optimized for seed
localization will be allowed. This will only be performed for second simulation with rectal
spacer in place , which will be the study used for final treatment.
Planning will be performed twice for this study using same guidelines as below.  Once without
the rectal spacer, using CT simulation scan #1.  Then plan will be performed again with the
rectal spacer in place using CT simulation scan #2. We anticipate that the rectal dose
constraints will be far easier to meet with rectal spacer placed.  The dosimetrist and physicians
will be expected to create as conformal a p lan as feasible to truly determine the extent of rectal
dose sparing that can be achieved without sacrificing PTV coverage, and other normal tissue
tolerance limits.
The entire prostate without the seminal vesicles will constitute the CTV target for this protocol.
It is not required to identify a GTV within the prostate, but if institutions have special techniques
to identify the gross tumor, such as MRI with high Tesla strength, it is encouraged to collect the
contours.  CTV target volume (entire prostat e gland) will be outlined by [CONTACT_646721].  The target will generally be drawn using CT soft tissue windows.  An additional 0.[ADDRESS_865846] (cranio -caudal) will be added
to the CTV to constitute the planning treatment volume (PTV) depending on the institution’s
accuracy and treating physician’s preference. UT Southwestern has determined that uniform
expansion of 0.3 cm is sufficient margin for PTV.
[IP_ADDRESS] Dosimetry
Three -dimensio nal coplanar or non -coplanar 3 -D beam, arc rotation, or Intensity Modulated
Radiotherapy (IMRT) beam arrangements will be custom designed for each case to deliver
highly conformal prescription dose distributions.  Non -opposing, non -coplanar beams are
prefe rable.  Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], 10 -15 beams of radiation will be used with roughly equal weighting.
Generally, more beams are used for larger lesion sizes.  When static beams are used, a
minimum of 10 non -opposing beams should be used.  For arc rotation techniques, a minimum
of 300 degrees (cumulative for all beams) should be utilized.  For this protocol, the isocenter is
defined as the common point of gantry and couch rotation for the treatment unit. Field aperture

19size and shape should correspond nearly identically t o the projection of the PTV along a
beam’s eye view (i.e. noadditional “margin” for dose build up at the edges of the blocks or MLC
jaws beyond the PTV).  As such, prescription lines covering the PTV will typi[INVESTIGATOR_122896] 60 -
90% line (rather than 95 -100%) ; however, higher isodoses (hotspots) must be manipulated to
occur within the target and not in adjacent normal tissue.  The isocenter in stereotactic
coordinates will be determined from system fiducials (or directly from the tumor) and translated
to the t reatment record.
The treatment dose plan will be made up of multiple static beams or arcs as described above.
The plan should be normalized to a defined point corresponding closely to the center of mass
of the PTV (COM PTV).  Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], this point will be the isocenter of the beam rotation; however, it
is not a protocol requirement for this point to be the isocenter.  Regardless, the point identified
as COM PTVmust have defined stereotactic coordinates and receive 100% of the normalized
dose.  Because the beam apertures coincide nearly directly with the edge of the PTV (little or
no added margin), the external border of the PTV will be covered by a lower isodose surface
than usually used in conventional radiotherapy planning, typi[INVESTIGATOR_195088] 80% but rangin g from
60-90%.  The prescription dose in five fractions will be delivered to the margin of the PTV and
fulfill the requirements below.  As such, a “hot spot” will exist within the PTV centrally at the
COM PTVwith a magnitude of the prescription dose times the reciprocal of the chosen
prescription isodose line (i.e., 60 -90%).
For purposes of dose planning and calculation of monitor units for actual treatment, all tissues
within the body should be modeled in the planning system as to their electron density. Proper
heterogeneity correction algorithms should be approved by [CONTACT_978].
Successful treatment planning will require accomplishment of all of the following criteria:
1) Normalization
The treatment plan should be normalized such that 100% corresponds to t he center of
mass of the PTV (COM PTV).  This point will typi[INVESTIGATOR_424430] (but is not required
to correspond) to the isocenter of the treatment beams.
2) Prescription Isodose Surface Coverage
The prescription isodose surface will be chosen such that 95% of the target volume
(PTV) is conformally covered by [CONTACT_533073] 99% of the target
volume (PTV) receives a minimum of 90% of the prescription dose.
3) Target Dose Heterogeneity
The prescription isodose surface selected in number 2 (above) must be ≥ 60% of the
dose at the center of mass of the PTV (COM PTV) and ≤ 90% of the dose at the center of
mass of the PTV (COM PTV). The COM PTVcorresponds to the normalization point (100%)
of the plan as noted in 1) above.
4) High Dose Spi[INVESTIGATOR_4598]
a)Location
Any dose greater than 105% of the prescription dose should occur primarily
within the PTV itself and not within the normal tissues outside of the PTV.
Therefore, the cumulative volume of all tissue outside of the PTV receiving a
dose greater t han 105% of prescription dose should be no more than 15% of the
PTV volume. However, if possible, attempts should be made to avoid higher
than the prescription isodose to the prostatic urethra within the prostate. Ideally,
these hot spots will be manipulated to occur within the peripheral zones of the
prostate.  IMRT and other techniques will be encouraged to accomplish this goal.
b)Volume
Conformality of PTV coverage will be judged such that the ratio of the vol ume of
the prescription isodose meeting criteria 1) through 4) to the volume of the PTV is
ideally less than 1.3.
5) Respect all critical organ dose -volume limits listed in Section 4.1.5 below.
6) Urethral “hot spot” avoidance.  It is recommended that efforts be made by [CONTACT_646722].  The
prostatic urethra should be identified as an avoidance structure such that dose beyond
the prescription dose ideally does not fall on this structure.  As an example, if the

20treatment dose covering the PTV corresponds to the 80% isodose line for a given patient,
hot spots of 20% higher dose will exist within the prostate.  The intensity modulat ion
techniques should be employed to distribute these hot spots away from the prostatic
urethra and more into the peripheral zones of the prostate.  Part of the rationale for daily
image guidance on this protocol is to carry out this intention of avoiding a “hot spot” to the
urethra in practice during treatment as depi[INVESTIGATOR_646679].
4.1.5 Critical Structures
[IP_ADDRESS] Critical Organ Dose -Volume Limits
The following table lists maximum dose limits to a point or volume within several critical organs.
These are limits, and treatment delivery that exceeds these limits will constitute a possible

4.3.[ADDRESS_865860] discretion.
4.3.10 Rectal corticosteroid medications
4.4 Other Modalities or Procedures
4.4.1 RECTAL SPACER AND FIDUCIAL PLACEME NT
Fiducial plac ement for image guidance is a routine procedure being performed by
[CONTACT_3784]/trained physicians at UTSW and Parkland Medical Center.  There will be
no significant changes in this routine procedure.  Fiducials will be placed by
[CONTACT_646726] [ADDRESS_865861] simulation.
In addition, rectal spacer placement will be performed by [CONTACT_646727], many of whom are members of the Urology department (Physicians
and P.A.s) or the Radiation Oncology departments of UTSW and MSKCC
(Physicians with significant brachytherapy and fiducial placement experience) .
Technique for spacer insertion is outlined below, based on excellent methods
paper from [37]).
Rectal Spacer (SpaceOAR):
The r ectal Spacer system consists of components for the preparation of the
absorbable hydrogel spacer with its delivery mechanism provided in a single -use
kit. The spacer hydrogel is formed by [CONTACT_646728], the
precursor and the accelerator, into the perirectal space. The solutions mix during
injection, initiating a cross -linking reaction that result in the formation of a soft
PEG -based gel within 10 s, without a measurable temperature rise. The hydrogel
remains in the body for 12 weeks (SpaceOAR), after which hydrolysis causes the
implant to liquefy, resulting in complete absorption.
Hydrogel injection technique:
The hy drogel is injected transperineally using hydrodissection to facilitate
placement. The potential perirectal space for hydrogel placement is between
Denonvilli ersfascia and the rectal wall ( Fig. 1). Denonvilliers’ fascia consists of a
single fibromuscular st ructure covering the posterior aspect of the prostate. This
important anatomical boundary separates the prostate from the anterior rectal
wall. It is important that the hydrogel is injected on the posterior side of
Denonvilliers ’ fascia and anterior to th e anterior rectal wall to minimize the risk of
pushing cancer cells away from the high dose radiation fi eld [42]. In addition,
care must be taken to avoid inadvertent injection into the rectal wall which can
potentially lead to ischaemia or increased rectal wall stresses. The spacing
hydrogel is injected using a transperineal approach under TR US guidance. A
transrectal approach cannot be used because of potential bacterial
contamination. Hydrodissection is a technique used to separate tissue planes
through the use of fluid.  The insertion of the hydrogel spacer is facilitated with
the use of hy drodissection. Small volumes of fluid are carefully injected through
an 18 -G needle between Denonvilliers’ fascia and the anterior rectal wall to open
the potential space before injecting the hydrogel. By [CONTACT_77203], enough space
for the spacer hydrogel is created and steady dispersion of the spacing agent is
ensured.
Insertion Procedure: The insertion procedure itself is a short procedure that can
be performed under local, spi[INVESTIGATOR_646681]. Prophylactic antibiotics will be given.  Transperineal fiducial placement
will be performed before the hyd rogel injection. \The patient will be placed in the

25lithotomy position. A TRUS probe, covered by a stand -off balloon will be used for
ultrasonography imaging and proper needle and anatomical visibility (Figure 2A).
The device is mounted to an adjustable st epper unit, freeing both the physician’s
hands. Under real -time TRUS guidance in the sagittal plane, the injection needle
(18G ×15 cm), with an attached syringe containing saline or lidocaine 0.5 –1.0%
diluted in 15 mL saline, is inserted ∼[ADDRESS_865862] between Denonvilliers’ fascia and
the anterior rectal wall. Hydrodissection is started using small volumes of fluid to
slowly open up the potential space between Denonvilliers’ fascia and the anterior
rectal wall. Once the correct space starts to open, the needle is advanced int o
the space, and saline injection/needle advancement continued until the needle tip
reaches mid -gland. By [CONTACT_77203], space for the spacer hydrogel is created ( Fig.
2b ). After confirming the correct position of the needle with both sagittal and
axial ult rasound views, and aspi[INVESTIGATOR_646682],
the saline syringe is removed. The syringe assembly is then attached,
maintaining needle position, and 10 mL of hydrogel will be administered in one
continuous motion in 8 –10 s wit hout moving the needle during injection (figure
2c). In the case of insufficient hydrodissection or unintentional rectal wall
perforation, spacer hydrogel injection is aborted. The distance from the rectal
wall to the prostate/Denonvilliers’ fascia will be measured before and after the
injection procedure.  Adverse events, if any, during and after the spacer injection
procedure will be assessed and documented.

5.5.[ADDRESS_865877]’s best
interest;
5.5.[ADDRESS_865878] becomes pregnant (pregnancy to be reported along same timelines as a serious
adverse event);
5.5.8 Development of second malignancy (except for basal cell carcinoma or squamous cell
carcinoma of the skin) that requires treatment ,which would interfere with this study;
5.5.[ADDRESS_865879] may be considered “lost to follow -up.” All attempts to
contact [CONTACT_646729]
5.[ADDRESS_865880] -Solid Tumors
5.6.1 Disease Parameters
Measurable Disease: Tumor l esions: Must be accurately measured in at least one
dimension (longest diameter in the plane of measurement is to be recorded) with a
minimum size of:
1. [ADDRESS_865881] scan (CT scan slice thickness no greater than 5 mm)
2. 10 mm caliper measurement by [CONTACT_110704] (lesions which cannot be accurately
measured with calipers should be recorded as non -measurable)
3. [ADDRESS_865882] x -ray.
Malignant lymph nodes: To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a
lymph node must be ≥ [ADDRESS_865883] scan (CT scan slice
thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm). Lymph nodes merit special
mention since they are normal anatomical structures which may be visible by [CONTACT_646730]. Pathological nodes which a re defined as measurable and
may be identified as target lesions must meet the criterion of a short axis of ≥ [ADDRESS_865884] in
which the image is obtained (for CT scan this is almost always the axial plane; for MRI
the plane of acquisition may be axial, sagittal or coronal). The smaller of these measures
is the short axis. For example, an abdominal node which is reported as being [ADDRESS_865885] ed as the node measurement. All other pathological
nodes (those with short axis ≥ 10 mm but < 15 mm) should be considered non -target
lesions. Nodes that have a short axis < 10 mm are considered non -pathological and
should not be recorded or followed.
Note : Previously irradiated lesions are non -measurable except in cases of documented
progression of the lesion since the completion of radiation therapy.
Non-measurable disease .
All other lesions are considered non -measurable, including small lesions (longes t
diameter < 10mm or pathological lymph nodes with ≥ 10 to < 15 mm short axis) as well
as truly non -measurable lesions. Lesions considered truly non -measurable include:
leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural or pericardial effusion, and inflammatory brea st
disease, lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung, abdominal masses /abdominal
organomegaly identified by [CONTACT_337384].
Target lesions .
All measurable lesions up to a maximum of five lesions t otal (and a maximum of two
lesions per organ) representative of all involved organs should be identified as target
lesions
Non-target lesions . All other lesions (or sites of disease) including any measurable
lesions over and above the five target lesions should be identified as non -target lesions
and should also be recorded at baseline. Measurements of these lesions are not
required, but the presence or absence of each should be noted throughout follow -up.
6.1.2Other Response Parameters
Disease -Free Interval: The disease -free interval will be measured from
the date of accession to the date of documentation of progression or until
the date of death (from other causes).
Time to Biochemical Failure: The RTOG -ASTRO definition (also known
as the Phoenix definition) of PSA failure will be used. Thus, when the
PSA rises by [CONTACT_726] 2 ng/ml above the lowest level (nadir) achieved
after treatment, biochemical failure has occurred and the date of the
failure is recorded at the time the nadir plus 2 ng/ml leve l is reached.
Time to Local Progression: The time to progression will be measured
from the date of study entry to the date of documented local progression
as determined by [CONTACT_461].
Time to Distant Failure: The time to distant failure will be meas ured from
the date of study entry to the date of documented regional nodal
recurrence or distant disease relapse. Patients with evidence of
biochemical failure, but a negative prostate biopsy, will be considered as
distant failure only.
Overall Survival: The survival time will be measured from the date of
accession to the date of death. All patients will be followed for survival.
Every effort should be made to document the cause of death.
Disease -Specific Survival Disease -specific survival will be meas ured
from the date of study entry to the date of death due to prostate cancer.
The following will be considered as failure events in assessing disease
specific survival:
Death certified as due to prostatic cancer.
Death from other causes with active malign ancy (clinical or biochemical
progression).
Death due to complications of treatment, irrespective of the status of
malignancy.

5.6.5 Response Criteria
[IP_ADDRESS] Evaluation of Target Lesions
Complete Response (CR) : Disappearance of all target lesions.
Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph
nodes (whether target or non -target) must have reduction in
short axis to <10 mm (the sum may not be “0” if there are target
nodes). Determined by [CONTACT_646731] 4 weeks apart. There can be no appearance of new
lesions.
Partial Response (PR) : At least a 30% decrease in the sum of
the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference
the bas eline sum LD. There can be no appearance of new
lesions.
Progressive Disease (PD) : > 20% increase in the SLD taking as
reference the smallest SLD recorded since the treatment started
(nadir) and minimum 5 mm increase over the nadir.
Stable Disease (SD) : Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for
PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference
the smallest sum LD since the treatment started. There can be
no unequivocal new lesions.
[IP_ADDRESS] Evaluation of Non -Target Lesions
Complete Response (CR ): Disappearance of all non -target
lesions and normalization of tumor marker level. All lymph nodes
must be non -pathological in size (< 10 mm short axis).
Incomplete Response/Stable Disease (Non -CR/Non -PD):
Persistence of one or more non -target lesion(s) and/or
maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits.
Progressive Disease (PD) : Appearance of one or more new
lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non -target
lesions

[IP_ADDRESS] Evaluation of Best Overall Response
The best overall response i s the best response recorded from
the start of the treatment until disease progression/recurrence
(taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest
measurements recorded since the treatment started). The
subject’s best response assignment will depe nd on the
achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria.

A ‘Non -CR/non -PD’ is preferred over ‘stable disease’ for non -target disease since SD is
increasingly used as endpoint for assessment of efficacy in some trials so to assign this
category when no lesions can be measured is not advised.
5.6.6 Duration of Response
Duration of overall response : The duration of overall response is
measured from the time measurement criteria are met for CR or PR
(whichever is first recorded) until the first date that recurrent or
progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for
progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the
treatment started).
The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measurement
criteria a re first met for CR until the first date that recurrent disease is
objectively documented.
Duration of stable disease : Stable disease is measured from the start of
the treatment until the criteria for progression are met, taking as
STU [ADDRESS_865887] measurements recorded since the treatment
started.
5.6.7 Progression -Free Survival
Progression -free survival (PFS) is defined as the duration of time from
start of treatment to time of progression.
5.7 Safety/tolerability
Analyses will be performed for all subjects having received at least one dose of
study drug. The study will use the CTCAE version 4.0 for reporting of non -

subject’s participation in the research, whether or not it is considered related to
the subject’s participation in the research.
Adverse events encompass clinical, physical and psychological harms. Adverse
events occur most commonly in the context of biomedical research, although on
STU [ADDRESS_865891] treatment will be considered acute adverse
events. All acute adverse events will be assessed and reported as per below.
Late Adverse Events (as applicable )
Adverse effects occurring in the time period from the end of acute monitoring , to
5years post treatment, will be defined as late adverse events. These events will
include all adverse events reported directly to a member of the study team and
will be captu red, assessed, graded and reported as appropriate.
In addition, the study team will only review encounters in records from Radiation
Oncology and Urology providers and limit reporting to events in the GI/GU
system.
Adverse events encompass clinical, phys ical and psychological harms. Adverse
events occur most commonly in the context of biomedical research, although on
occasion, they can occur in the context of social and behavioral research.
Adverse events may be expected or unexpected.
Severity
Adverse events will be graded by a numerical score according to the defined NCI
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE V4.0) and
version number 4.0specified in the protocol. Adverse events not specifically
defined in the NCI CTCAE V4.0 will be scored on the Adverse Event log
according to the general guidelines provided by [CONTACT_315092] V4.0 and as
outlined below.
 Grade 1: Mild
 Grade 2: Moderate
 Grade 3: Severe or medically significant but not immediately life
threatening
 Grade 4: Life threatening consequences
 Grade 5: Death related to the adverse event
Serious Adverse Events
ICH Guideline E2A and the UTSW IRB define serious adverse events as those
events, occurring at any dose, which meets any of the following criteria:
 Results in de ath
 Immediately life -threatening
 Results in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]1,2or prolongation of existing
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]
 Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity
 Results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect
 Based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the subject’s
health and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of
the other outcomes listed in this definition.
Note: A “Serious adverse event” is by [CONTACT_646732]. Serious adverse events may or may not be related to the research
STU [ADDRESS_865892]. A serious adverse event determination does not require the event to be
related to the research. That is, both events completely unrelated to the condition
under study and even ts that are expected in the context of the condition under
study may be serious adverse events, independent of relatedness to the study
itself. As examples, a car accident requiring >24 hour inpatient admission to the
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_263996] a serious adverse ev ent for any research participant; likewise,
in a study investigating end -stage cancer care, any hospi[INVESTIGATOR_646683] -specified period of monitoring for adverse and serious
adverse events would be a serious adverse event , even if the event observed is
a primary clinical endpoint of the study.
1Pre-planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_114579].
Note: If events occur during a pre -planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_64329], that prolong
the existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11298], those events should be evaluated and/or reported as
SAEs.
2NCI defines hospi[INVESTIGATOR_646684] 24 hours. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_646685] t he AE truly fits this definition and NOT for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_646686]. For example: a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_114582] a patient
is admitted for observation or minor treatment (e.g. hydration) and released in
less than 24 hours. Furthermore , hospi[INVESTIGATOR_646687] a routine AE or in an
expedited report.
6.2.2 Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to Subjects or Others (UPI[INVESTIGATOR_20865]):
The phrase “unanticipated problems inv olving risks to subjects or others” is
found, but not defined in the HHS regulations at 45 CFR 46, and the FDA
regulations at 21 CFR 56.108(b)(1) and [ADDRESS_865893], which is de fined in 21
CFR 812.3(s). Guidance from the regulatory agencies considers unanticipated
problems to include any incident, experience, or outcome that meets ALL three
(3) of the following criteria:
Unexpected in terms of nature, severity or frequency given (a) the research
procedures that are described in the protocol -related documents, such as the
IRB-approved research protocol and informed consent document; and (b) the
characteristics of the subject population being studied;
AND
Related or possibly re lated to participation in the research (possibly related
means there is a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome
may have been caused by [CONTACT_3459]);
AND
Suggests that the research places subjects or others at greater risk of harm
(including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously
known or recognized. Note: According to OHRP, if the adverse event is serious,
it would always suggest a greater risk of harm.
Follow -up
All adverse events will be followed up according to good medical practices.

386.2.3 Reporting SAEs and UPI[INVESTIGATOR_646688] (SCCC) Data Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC)
All SAE/UPI[INVESTIGATOR_114585], which occur in research subjects on protocols for
which the SCCC is the DSMC of record require reporting to the DSMC
regardless of whether IRB reporting is required. All SAEs/UPI[INVESTIGATOR_646689] -specified monitoring period should be submitted to the SCCC
DSMC wi thin 5 business days of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_646690](s). In addition, for participating centers other than UTSW,
local IRB guidance should be followed for local reporting of serious adverse
events.
The UTSW study team is r esponsible for submitting SAEs/UPI[INVESTIGATOR_646691].  Hardcopi[INVESTIGATOR_646692]; FDA Form #3500A forms, or other sponsor forms, if applicable;
and/or any other supporting documentation available s hould be submitted to the
DSMC Coordinator.  The DSMC Coordinator forwards the information onto the
DSMC Chairman who determines if immediate action is required.  Follow -up eIRB
reports, and all subsequent SAE/UPI[INVESTIGATOR_646693] o
submitted to the DSMC Chair who determines if further action is required. (See
Appendix III of the SCCC DSMC Plan for a template Serious Adverse Event Form
which may be utilized when a sponsor form is unavailable and SAE submission to
the eIRB is not req uired).
If the event occurs on a multi -institutional clinical trial coordinated by [CONTACT_646733], the DOT Manager or lead coordinator
ensures that all participating sites are notified of the event and resulting action,
according to FDA guidance for expedited reporting. DSMC Chairperson reviews
all SAEs/UPI[INVESTIGATOR_572748].  The DSMC
Chairperson determines whether action is required and either takes action
immediately, convenes a special DSMC sessi on (physical or electronic), or
defers the action until a regularly scheduled DSMC meeting.

6.3 Steps to Determine If a Serious Adverse Event Requires Expedited
Reporting to the SCCC DSMC and/or HRPP
Step 1 :Identify the type of adverse event using the NCI Common Terminology
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v4) .
Step 2 :Grade the adverse event using the NCI CTCAE v4.
Step 3 :Determine whether the adverse event is related to the protocol therapy
Attribution categories are as follows:
-Definite –The AE is clearly related to the study treatment.
-Probable –The AE is likely related to the study treatment.
-Possible –The AE may be related to the study treatment.
-Unlikely –The AE may NOT be related to the study treatment.
-Unrelated –The AE is clearly NOT related to the study treatment.
Note :This includes all events that occur within [ADDRESS_865897] dose
of treatment and is attributed (possibly, probably, or definitely) to the agent(s)
must also be reported accordingly up to [ADDRESS_865898] -treatment .
Step 4 :Determine the prior experience of the adverse event .
Expected events are those that have been previously identified as resulting f rom
administration of the agent .An adverse event is considered unexpected, for
expedited reporting purposes only, when either the type of event or the severity
of the event is notlisted in:
the current known adverse events listed in the Agent Information Section
of this protocol (if applicable);
the drug package insert (if applicable);
the current Investigator’s Brochure (if applicable)
the Study Agent(s)/Therapy(ies) Background and Associated Known
Toxicities section of this protocol
6.4 Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_646697], defined as
grade 3 -5 toxicity related to the following organ systems: infectious disease,
gastrointestinal, renal, genitor -urinary, sexual, reproductive, neurological, blood,
bone marro w, or constitutional symptoms OR any other grade 4 or 5 toxicity
attributed to the therapy or rectal spacer injection procedure occurring in higher
than 30% of treated patients.  If a single patient has more than one unacceptable
toxicity, they will only b e counted as one unacceptable toxicity for this analysis.
The following early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_505395]:
[ADDRESS_865899] 20 evaluable patients

41If the number of unacceptable toxicities observed demonstr ate via the monitoring
rules above that the  treatment -related unacceptable toxicity rate is 30% or more,
consideration will be initiated for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_10098].  In this case, the study chair,
study PIs, and statistician will review the toxicity data alon g with the Data Safety
Monitoring Committee and make appropriate recommendations about continuing
the study.   Additionally, the treatment -related unacceptable toxicity rate will
continued to be monitored during the five year follow -up period.  If the
unac ceptable toxicity rate exceeds 30% at any time during the five year follow -up
period, the study chair, study PIs, and statistician will review the toxicity data
along with the Data Safety Monitoring Committee and make appropriate
recommendations about repo rting the information.
7.0 DRUG INFORMATION
Not applicable to this study.
8.0 CORRELATIVES/SPECIAL STUDIES
There are no correlative studies associated with this protocol.
9.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
9.1 Study Design/Study Endpoints
Phase II Study Endpoints
10.1.1 Primary Endpoint
The primary endpoint of this study is to determine determine whether use of a
rectal spacer with SABR will decrease the rate of rectal toxicity when performing
SABR treatments for prostate cancer and the effectiveness of space creation by
[CONTACT_646735].  To this extent, our primary objectives are
to measure mucosal ulceration rate, and
to determine ability of spacer to create >=7.5 mm space: rate of
space creation of >=7.5mm,
10.1.2 Secondary Endpoints
To assess spacer related acute toxicity, defined as toxicities
occurring in the two week period between spacer placement and
start of radiation treatment.
To determine spacer’s efficacy as measured by [CONTACT_646717] [ADDRESS_865900] 50%.  This will be
determined by [CONTACT_646718].
Acute GU and GI toxicity is defined as grade 1 -5 toxicity occurring
prior to 270 days from the start of protocol treatment. It is graded
based on CTCA E v4.0.
Delayed GU and GI toxicity is defined as grade 1 -5 toxicity occurring
after 270 days from the start of protocol treatment. It is graded based
on CTCAE v4.0.
Non GU and GI toxicity.
Biochemical failure RTOG -ASTRO definition (also known as Phoenix
definition) -Thus, when the PSA rises by [CONTACT_726] 2 ng/ml above
the lowest level (nadir) achieved after treatment,, biochemical failure
has occurred and the date of the failure is recorded at the time the
nadir plus 2 ng/ml level is reached.
Overall survi val
Disease -specific survival
Clinical progression including local/regional and distant relapse

42HRQOL questionnaires
9.2 Sample Size and Accrual
We plan to enroll 45 patients for this study. This sample size is based on
considerations of two primary endpoints: mucosal ulceration rate and rate of
space creation of >=7.5mm. Forty -five patients will ensure less than 13.5%
margin of error (95% confiden ce) for estimated mucosal ulceration rate and 6.5%
margin of error (95% confidence) for estimated rate of space creation of
>=7.5mm. The calculations assume new mucosal ulceration rate of <70% and
95% rate of space creation of >=7.5mm. This sample size als o has >90% power
in detecting significant reduction in mucosal ulceration rate from current observed
rate of 90% (alpha=0.05, two sided exact test).
10.2.1 Patient Accrual and Study Duration
It is expected that it will take approximately 1 -2 years to complete the accrual for
the phase II study.  Primary endpoints can be determined for each patient within
24-36 weeks of treatment initial period based on our phase I study’s experience
of anoscopic evaluation.  The analysis for secondary endpoints such as late
toxicity will be carried out after each patient has had at least 270 days (i.e., 9
months) of follow -up from the end of the acute period, a total of 540 days (i.e., 18
months) of follow -up. For other secondary endpoint of biochemical failure, an
additional [ADDRESS_865901] discontinued follow -up
procedures.
9.3 Data Analyses Plans
10.3.1. The Analysis of Rectal Spacer Efficacy
For primary endpoints, numbers and rates of spacer related mucosal ulceration
and success of spacer to create >=7.5 mm space will be summarized along with
their 95% confidence intervals. Rectal ulceration rate will be measured at
specified time points by [CONTACT_646736].  Photographs and/or video images will be taken, and size and location of
ulcers if present will be documented at each visi t.Rate of mucosal ulceration for
patients with spacers will also be compared with currently observed rate using
exact test.  Analysis on other measures will be all descriptive. Success in
decreasing the PRC [ADDRESS_865902] 50%will be
tabulated for examination in determining future studies.
10.3.2The Analysis of Late GU/GI Toxicity: This analysis will be carried out
when each patient has had at least 270 days (i.e., 9 months) of follow -up after
the end of the acute period, a total of 540 days (i.e., 18 months) of follow -up. The
time to the occurrence of severe late GU/GI toxicity is defined as the time interval
from start of protocol treatment to the date of onset of grade 3 -5 GU/GI toxicity.
The time analysis for recording severe late GU/GI toxicity for this protocol will be
limited to 540 days from start of protocol therapy.  If n o such toxicity is observed
before the time of the analysis, the patient will be censored at the time of the
analysis. Numbers and rates of toxicities will be tabulated for report. We will not
be performing inferential statistical analysis as this study is not powered for such
analysis.
10.3.3Estimation of Secondary Endpoints Related to the Efficacy: We will
examine all the secondary endpoints in relation to efficacy.
10.[ADDRESS_865903] with this study (patent ownership,
royalties, or financial gain greater than the minimum allowable by [CONTACT_1385],
etc.) must have the conflict reviewed by [CONTACT_646737]. All investigators will follow the
University conflict of interest policy .
11.[ADDRESS_865904] (IRB) Approval and Consent
It is expected that the IRB will have the proper representation and function in
accordance with federally mandated regulatio ns.The IRB must approve the
consent form and protocol.
In obtaining and documenting informed consent, the investigator should comply
with the applicable regulatory requirement(s), and should adhere to Good Clinical
Practice (GCP) and to ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of
Helsinki.
Before recruitment and enrollment onto this study, the subject will be given a full
explanation of the study and will be given the opportunity to review the consent
form. Each consent form must include all the relevant elements currently required
by [CONTACT_44316]. Once this essential
information has been provided to the subject and the investigator is assured that
thesubject understands the implications of participating in the study, the subject
will be asked to give consent to participate in the study by [CONTACT_646738]-approved consent form.
Prior to a patient’s participation in the trial, the written informed consent form
should be signed and personal ly dated by [CONTACT_646739].
10.3 Required Documentation (for multi -site studies)
Before the study can be initiated at any site, the following documentation must be
provided to the Research Office .
Acopy of the official IRB approval letter for the protocol and informed
consent
IRB membership list orFederal wide Assurance letter
CVs and medical licensure for the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_646698]
Form FDA 1572 appropriately filled out and signed with appropriate
documentation (NOTE: this is required if {institution} holds the IND .
Otherwise, the affiliate Investigator’s signature [CONTACT_646745])
A copy of the IRB -approved consent form
CAP and CLIA Laboratory certification numbers and institution lab normal
values
Executed clinical research contract
10.[ADDRESS_865905] should be numbered using the schema provided
above. Upon registration, the registrar will assign the additional registration code
according to the numbering schema outlined above, which shou ld then be
entered as the patient study id in Velos upon updating the status to enrolled.
10.5 Data Management and Monitoring/Auditing
REDCap is the UTSW SCCC institutional choice for the electronic data capture
of case report forms for SCCC Investigator Initiated Trials. REDCap will be used
for electronic case report forms in accordance with Simmons Comprehensive
Cancer Center requiremen ts, as appropriate for the project. All subjects
consenting to participate in any aspect of the trial must be registered on REDCap
before initiating protocol activities. All research data will be recorded and entered
into Case Report Forms using REDCap. To xicity will be reviewed on an ongoing
basis and will be reported per SCCC -DSMC guidelines.
In order to facilitate remote source to case report form verification, the Simmons
Comprehensive Cancer Center study team will require other institutions
particip ating in this trial as sub -sites to enter data into the selected EDC system
and upload selected de -identified source materials when instructed
Trial monitoring will be conducted no less than annually and refers to a regular
interval review of trial relat ed activity and documentation performed by [CONTACT_646740]/or the CRO Multi -Center IIT Monitor. This review includes but is not limited to
accuracy of case report forms, protocol compliance, timeless and accuracy of
Velos entries and AE/SAE management and repo rting. Documentation of trial
monitoring will be maintained along with other protocol related documents and
will be reviewed during internal audit.
For further information, refer to the UTSW SCCC IIT Management Manual .
The UTSW Simmons Comprehensive Ca ncer Center (SCCC) Data Safety
Monitoring Committee (DSMC) is responsible for monitoring data quality and
patient safety for all UTSW SCCC clinical trials.  As part of that responsibility, the
DSMC reviews all local serious adverse events and UPI[INVESTIGATOR_646699] a quarterly basis.  The quality
assurance activity for the Clinical Research Office provides for periodic auditing
of clinical research documents to ensure data integrity and regulatory
compliance. A copy of the DSMC plan is available upon request.
The SCCC DSMC meets quarterly and conducts annual comprehensive reviews
of ongoing clinical trials, for which it serves as the DSMC of record. The QAC
works as part of the DSMC to conduct regular audits based on the level of risk.
Audit findings are reviewed at the next available DSMC meeting.  In this way,
frequency of DSMC monitoring is dependent upon the level of risk.  Risk level is
determined by [CONTACT_264031] a number of factors such as the phase
of the study; the type of investigational agent, device or intervention being
studied; and monitoring required to ensure the safety of study subjects based on
the associated risks of the study. Protocol -specific DSMC plans must be
consistent with the se principles.
Clinical trials are assessed for safety on a continual basis throughout the life of
the trial. All SAE’s and any AEs that are unexpected and possibly/likely related to
study participation are reported to UTSW IRB through an electronic rese arch
system per UTSW IRB guidelines. SAEs are reported to the sponsor per specific
sponsor requirements. These SAEs are reported to the SCCC DSMC on a real
time basis. All local SAEs will be reported to the SCCC DSMC. SAE reports can
be either scanned/emai led to the coordinator of SCCC DSMC or sent through
interoffice mail.

increasing malignancy. Because of histologic variation in the tumor, two patterns are recorded for each
case, a primary or predominate pattern and a secondary or lesser pattern.
The Gleason Score is the sum of the p rimary and secondary pattern, If only one pattern is present, the
primary

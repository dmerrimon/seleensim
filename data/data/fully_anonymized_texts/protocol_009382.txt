Hypothesis Er:YAG removes biofilm more effectively from titanium surfaces than carbon fiber curettes.  Aim The aim of this study is to compare the amount of residual biofilm on titanium discs after decontamination with Er:YAG laser and carbon fiber curette.  Background and Rationale Dental Implants The American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons estimated that 69% of adults ages [ADDRESS_900188] one permanent tooth. The advent of oral implants has revolutionized dental practice and industry as a whole.1 Implants provide a solution for tooth loss that is predictable with long-term success.1 A success rate of 90% has been reported for both fully or partially edentulous restorations.2-[ADDRESS_900189] structural connection at light microscopic level between the bone and surface of the implant.7 The dental implant and prosthetic market in the U.S is projected to reach $6.[ADDRESS_900190] been recognized as peri-implant mucositis and peri-implantitis.8 Peri-implant mucositis is defined as a reversible inflammation in the soft tissues surrounding the implant, while peri-implantitis is designated as inflammation associated with loss of supporting bone around an implant.8 Heitz-Mayfield9 identified several diagnostic criteria for peri-implant diseases such as probing depth, attachment level changes, bleeding on probing, suppuration, mobility, and radiographic bone changes. The article9 also presented oral hygiene, history of periodontitis, diabetes, smoking, and alcohol consumption as risk factors in developi[INVESTIGATOR_666827]-implantitis. In their recent meta-analysis, Derks et al.10 estimated the prevalence of peri-implant mucositis and peri-implantitis to be 43% and 22% respectively.10 These high prevalence rates led to development of different methods for implant surface decontamination.11 Treatment of Peri-Implant Diseases Bacterial colonization on the implant surface is the main causative factor in development of peri-implant diseases.12-16 Formation of adherent bacterial biofilm on

Surprisingly, the roughest surface was produced by [CONTACT_666830]. The plastic surface alteration was determined to be insignificant. Homiak et al.[ADDRESS_900192] been developed to overcome inadequacies such as sustained antibiotics release, antiseptics, air abrasion, and laser therapy.17  Er:YAG Laser  Laser therapy has been advocated for implant surface decontamination.31, [ADDRESS_900193] been evaluated for this purpose such as erbium-doped yttrium–aluminum–garnet (Er: YAG), carbon dioxide (CO2), gallium–aluminum– arsenide

Kreisler et al.36 incubated Streptococcus sanguinis over titanium discs and irradiate them with power 60 and 120 mJ/pulse at 10 Hz. Their results reported reduction ranges from 98.3% to 99.94%. Matsuyama et al.37 evaluated Er: YAG in six contaminated healing abutments. They showed that Er: YAG at 30 mJ/pulse and 30 Hz with water spray was capable of effectively removing plaque and calculus on the implant abutments without injuring their surfaces. Quaranta et al.38 explored different types of implant surfaces contaminated with Porphyromonas gingivalis. They observed values of 76.2% for machine tested implants, 90.9% for titanium plasma spray implants, and 98.3% for sandblasted and etched implants. A minimal residual bacterial presence was observed in all groups. Sennhenn-Kirchner et al.[ADDRESS_900195] Candida albicans incubation. They found Er:YAG laser damaged the fungal cells to a great extent wherever it was applied on direct contact. Decontamination efficacy was dose-dependent with values ranging from 59% following irradiation with 80 mJ/pulse at 5 Hz40 to 99.94% following irradiation with 120 mJ/pulse at 10 Hz.36 Schwarz et al.41 in a canine study showed Er:YAG to be more suitable to promote re-osseointegration than ultrasonics or plastic curettes. Studies evaluated efficiency of decontamination using scanning light microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), counting the colony forming units (CFU), bacterial smears, and photometric XTT–formazan evaluations.31 Molecular Probes’ LIVE/DEAD® BacLightTM Bacterial Viability Kits provide a novel two-color fluorescence assay of bacterial viability that has proven useful for a diverse array of bacterial genera. LIVE/DEAD BacLight allow researchers to easily, reliably and quantitatively distinguish live and dead bacteria in minutes, even in a mixed population containing a range of bacterial types. Since no consensus treatment for peri-implantitis has yet emerged, there is an urgent need for quantitative evaluation of the available treatment options.  This study is designed to compare the biofim removal efficiency of the Er:YAG laser with mechanical biofilm removal tools.  Our goal is to establish whether Er:YAG laser significantly improves titanium surface decontamination.  Our findings may contribute to the development of novel and efficient treatment of peri-implantitis. Standard of Care in the TUSDM Periodontal Clinic  For patients who are experiencing a failing dental implant, the treatment starts with improving overall oral hygiene and controlling any etiological factors that prevent restoration of optimum oral health. The second step usually involves a surgical

If the bony defect developed by [CONTACT_666833], bone regenerative therapy may be used.   I) Research Plan  A) Experimental Design  This study is designed to investigate the efficiency of biofilm decontamination of Er:YAG laser compared to carbon fiber curette. The first phase is clinical wherein experimental subjects will be recruited. Full periodontal examination will be performed and alginate impressions will be taken. A custom mouth guard that holds multiple titanium discs will be fabricated. Experimental subjects will be instructed to wear this mouth guard for 72 hours, during which time a natural bacterial biofim will form on the disc surfaces. The second phase of the study will be performed after collecting the discs from the subjects and exposing them ex vivo to one of four treatment groups 1) Er:YAG laser, 2) carbon fiber curette, 3) titanium brush, and 4) no treatment (control). The biofilm will be stained with LIVE/DEAD BacLight dye and the residual biofilm will be visualized under fluorescence microscopy.  Quantification of residual biofilm will be performed using image analysis software (Image J, NIH).  Statistical methods will be used to determine the significance of each treatment modality. The primary outcome of the study is the percent area of the titanium disc covered by [CONTACT_666834].    B) Power Calculation   A power calculation was performed via the statistical software nQuery Advisor (Version 7.0). Using the results of Schwarz et al.[ADDRESS_900196] deviations, and assuming that the mean for the combination group is equal to the mean of the Er:YAG laser group, a sample of 8 subjects, allowing for ~20% dropout with a final projected sample size of 6 ([ADDRESS_900197], 64 total discs) is sufficient for a Type I error rate of 5% and a power over 99%. Discs retrieved from each mouth guard will be randomized over the 4 treatment groups using the “sample” function of the statistical software package R (Version 3.1.2), so that each subject will contribute two discs to each treatment group.   C) Statistical analysis   Descriptive statistics (means, standard deviations, medians, and inter-quartile ranges) will be computed by [CONTACT_19313]. Statistical significance will be assessed via repeated-measures ANOVA if the data are normally distributed, and Friedman’s test if the data are not normally distributed. P<0.05 will be considered statistically significant. The analysis will be conducted using SPSS Version 22.  D) Products  Titanium discs will be supplied by [CONTACT_666835] (Andover, MA).

Version 08.10.17                    Page 6 of 17  E) Subject Characteristics  Inclusion criteria: - Adults (18 years or older). - Presence of enough teeth to support the mouth guard. - English proficiency. - Subjects diagnosed with clinical health, gingivitis, or slight chronic periodontitis defined as periodontal inflammation with slight (1-2mm) attachment loss.  Subjects will not be stratified based on oral health.  Exclusion criteria: - Subjects with insufficient dental support for the mouth guard - Subjects diagnosed with moderate or severe chronic periodontitis. - Subjects with known allergy to acrylic or titanium. - Subjects who smoke cigarettes, cigars, snuff tobacco, or any other form of smoking. - Subjects with a history of antibiotic treatment within the last six months. - Subjects with contraindications to wearing a mouth guard, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or severe sleep apnea. - Subjects with uncontrolled or debilitating medical conditions, including but not limited to subjects with uncontrolled diabetes, hematologic disorders, cancers, immunosuppression, severe cardiovascular disease, or uncontrolled thyroid disease  - Subjects that are currently pregnant according to self-report as hormonal changes may affect the outcomes of the study. - Subjects who are unable or unwilling to sign the informed consent form (ICF). -  Subjects may not participate in this study if they concurrently participate in another research study.  Subject withdrawal and termination criteria: - Subject may withdraw from the study at any time.  Subjects may remain patients of TUSDM if they decide to withdraw from the study.   - Investigators may terminate subjects if they no longer fulfill inclusion criteria, if an exclusion criterion is met, or if they do not show up for scheduled study visits.  Subjects may remain patients of TUSDM if they are withdrawn from the study. If a subject withdraws from the study early and returns the mouth guard, the mouth guard and the titanium discs will not be analyzed and will be disposed of.  Subjects withdrawing from the study early will not be eligible for the $[ADDRESS_900198]. - Unanticipated Adverse Device Event   The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_662910] (either withdrawn subjects or subjects completing the study) are in need of additional treatment and/or follow-up observation.  Potential unforeseen adverse events may include allergic reaction to acrylic or titanium, or irritation of the gum by [CONTACT_666836].

Version 08.10.17                    Page 7 of 17 Subjects and/or their insurance will be responsible for the cost of any standard of care follow-up visits or additional treatment that is not part of this study.   F) Assessment 1) Risk  Risks associated with standard of care periodontal examination for periodontal patients include sensitivity, discomfort, pain and bleeding during examination. Swelling is not expected.  Risks associated with the mouth guard include speech alteration and esthetic concerns. Abstaining from the use of toothpaste and mouthwash for 3 days poses minimal health risk as the principal factor in oral hygiene is the mechanical plaque removal by [CONTACT_666837].  The risk associated with brushing without toothpaste or not using mouthwash for 3 days is halithosis (bad breath). Also, disc de-attachment presents another risk of swallowing or aspi[INVESTIGATOR_246359]. That risk will be minimized by [CONTACT_666838] (PeriAcryl).  Potential unforeseen adverse events may include allergic reaction to acrylic or titanium, or irritation of the gum by [CONTACT_666839].    Loss of confidentiality is also a risk of participation. This risk will be minimized by [CONTACT_666840].  2) Benefits  There are no specific benefits to study participants in this study.  Potential benefits to society might include improved treatment protocols for peri-implantitis. Potential benefits to science might include increased understanding of methods used to decontaminate implant surfaces.  3) Alternatives  The alternative is to not participate in the study and receive standard of care periodontal treatment at the TUSDM clinic at standard clinic costs.  G) Study Procedures  Visit 1: Screening and consent (Approximately 90 minutes)  Subjects will be asked to read the informed consent form (ICF). Subjects will be given ample time to have any questions answered. If a subject decides to participate, he or she will be asked to sign the ICF. A copy of the ICF will be given to the subject.  Medical history and demographic information will be collected. To determine eligibility periodontal examination will be performed according to standard of care, including

Version 08.10.[ADDRESS_900199]’s arch size in conformance with standard of care practice.  After Visit 1 (In the Laboratory): Impression pouring, cast, and mouth guard fabrication  After the visit, alginate impressions will be disinfected and poured in the dental laboratory using dental stone. Subjects are not required to stay for the length of time of laboratory procedures.  Dental stone will be allowed to set for [ADDRESS_900200] retrieval. After retrieval, casts will be trimmed according to laboratory standards. Titanium discs (5mm diameter, 1 mm thick, 4 discs each on the left and right premolar/molar areas, a total of [ADDRESS_900201], supplied by [CONTACT_666835]) will be fixed on the buccal surfaces of posterior teeth of the casts. A computerized positive pressure thermal-molding machine (Biostar, Great Lakes Orthodontics, Tonawanda, NY) will be used to fabricate a 1mm thick mouth guard on top of the cast, covering the attached titanium discs. The mouth guard will be removed from cast and trimmed to proper size. New titanium discs of the same size and count will be secured in mouth guard compartments with surgical adhesive (PeriAcryl, Salvin Dental Specialties, Charlotte, NC, Figure 1). The final shape of the appliance will resemble an occlusal mouth guard. The mouth guard will be disinfected in 0.12% chlorhexidine.

Intra-oral photograph will be taken in frontal view of the subject’s teeth and gums while wearing the mouth guard.  Subject will be asked to use the mouth guard for 72 hours continuously except during eating. Patient will be instructed to brush their teeth twice daily without the use of toothpaste and to floss once daily. Mouth rinses will be prohibited. These instructions will be given verbally with demonstration facing a mirror.  The same instructions will be provided to study subjects in writing as well.  Visit 3: [ADDRESS_900204] retrieval (approximately 30 minutes)   Medical history will be reviewed. Eligibility criteria will be evaluated. Mouth guard will be retrieved from patient and stored until analysis.   After Visit 3(In the laboratory): Group Assigning, Experimental Treatments, and Measurements  After the visit, titanium discs will be separated from the mouth guard. Subjects are not required to stay for the length of time of laboratory procedures.  Care will be taken not to disturb the surface biofilm.  The back side of each disc will be numbered 1-[ADDRESS_900205] will be randomized over the 4 treatment groups using the “sample” function of the statistical software package R (Version 3.1.2), so that each subject will contribute two discs to each treatment group.  After treatment, discs will be placed individually in a 24-well tissue culture plate, rinsed with saline and stained using the LIVE/DEAD BacLight dye Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Equal volumes of Component A and Component B will be combined in a microfuge tube. The dye mixture will be added to the discs and incubated at room temperature in the dark for 15 minutes. The discs will be observed in a fluorescence microscope equipped with FITC/TRITC filter sets (Zeiss Axiovert 200, Carl Zeiss AG, Oberkochen, [LOCATION_013]).  Percent biofilm covered area will be calculated with digital image analysis software (ImageJ, NIH).

An adverse event in this study may be the loss of the mouth guard or the loss of a titanium disc.  Adverse events will be recorded in source documents and on case report forms. All adverse events and non-serious situations will be recorded, monitored, and reported to the IRB at time of continuing review or at the study’s termination if this occurs before the study’s next continuing review.  Adverse events will be recorded in source documents and on case report forms. All adverse events and non-serious situations will be recorded, monitored, and reported to the IRB at time of continuing review.  Serious Adverse Events   A serious adverse event is one that results in death, or is life-threatening, or results in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], or results in a persistent or significant disability/incapacitation, or results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or may jeopardize the subject’s health and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed above.  Based on clinical experience with mouth guards it is unlikely that study subjects will experience any serious adverse event.  Should a serious adverse events occur, will be recorded in source documents and on case report forms. Serious Adverse Events that meet the criteria of an unanticipated problem will be reported to the IRB within 5 business days following the Reportable New Information Policy. Serious adverse events that do not meet the criteria for an unanticipated problem will be recorded in source documents and on case report forms, and included in the summary reporting form at the continuing review or at the study’s termination if this occurs before the study’s next continuing review.  Unanticipated Problems  An unanticipated problem is an incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the following criteria: 1) The nature, severity, or frequency is unexpected for the subject population or research activities as described in the current IRB approved protocol, supporting documents, and the ICF(s); 2) it is related or possibly related to

Unanticipated problems will be recorded in source documents and on case report forms. Unanticipated problems will be reported to the IRB within 5 business days after the PI/study team becomes aware of the problem. A Reportable New Information Form will be submitted to the IRB no later than 5 business days after the PI/study team becomes aware of the problem.  Subject Participation  2) Screening   Dr. AlMoharib will conduct screening as outlined in Visit 1.  3) Informed Consent  Dr. AlMoharib will introduce the study.    Written consent will be obtained following “SOP: Written Documentation of Consent (HRP-091).” Consenting will take place in a private clinic bay area and the patient will be given as much time as he/she needs to consider participation. The participant will be invited to include or exclude any associates (e.g., loved ones) in the consent process.   Patients will be asked to read the consent form and given ample opportunity to have their questions answered.  To avoid coercion, the consenting investigator will read through the copy of the consent form with the participant section by [CONTACT_68979], making sure the participant understands each section and has an opportunity to ask questions.  If at any time the participant indicates s/he is not interested in participation, the meeting will end.    If after going through the consent form, the participant indicates s/he would like to discuss the study with associates or think about participating, then the meeting will be ended and the participant will be asked to contact [CONTACT_666841] s/he makes her decision. If the participant contacts the study in the future for participation, s/he will be invited back to the clinic, and if informed consent is given at that time, study activities will begin then.  If the participant indicates s/he may be interested in participating after going through the consent form with the investigator, and the investigator determines the participant has the capacity to provide informed consent, the participant will be asked to provide informed consent at that time. Patients will certify their willingness to participate in the study by [CONTACT_666842].  The subject will be given a copy of the consent form.

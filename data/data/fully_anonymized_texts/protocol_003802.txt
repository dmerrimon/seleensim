in Subjects  with Various Pain Etiologies  
Protocol Number  RBI.2015 .005 
Name [CONTACT_863823]® Therapy System  
Phase of Development  Post-Market  
Objective  To obtain data on the safety and effectiveness of PEMF treatment 
in patients with various pain etiologies .  Data from enrolled 
patients will contribute to a patient registry on the post -market 
use of Provant.  
Number of Subjects  Up to 300 subjects will be enrolled . 
Study Design  This is a n open -label , non-controlled  trial in subjects with various 
pain etiologies  at multiple centers in the US .  Eligible subjects 
will include those  ≥ [ADDRESS_1204521] been deemed 
appropriate for treatment with Provant by [CONTACT_1704] 
(prescriber) .  Subjects will treat based on the treatment prescribed 
(location, frequency, duration) by [CONTACT_1704].   
Assessments  Data from assessments  administered as part of standard of 
practice will be obtained  at baseline and , at a minimum,  at the 
end of treatment .  Protocol required assessments will include 
basel ine, interim visit  / end of treatment  visit and 3 -month 
follow -up (post -treatment)  pain scores using an 11 -point numeric 
pain rating scale (NPRS), and a Clinical Global Impression – 
Global Improvement (CGI -I) Scale and a Patient Global 
Impression of C hange  (PGIC)  Scale administered at follow -up / 
end of treatment visits. If the i nvestigator administers a dditional 
assessments  during the course of treatment,  the data will be 
collected.  
 
Safety will be assessed during office visits and through review of 
AE reports and concomitant treatments and medications. All 
concomitant drug or non -drug treatments used during the study 
will be recorded.  
 
Study P rocedures  Subjects will be evaluated for eligibility at the 
Screening/Enrollment Visit.   Following assessment of eligibility, 
subjects will be assessed using  standard of practice baseline 
measures and the NPRS related to the location of treatment .   
Subjects will be instructed in the use of the device  and will self -
treat as prescribed by [CONTACT_1704].  As part of the 
investigator ’s standard of practice , subjects may be provided with 
a patient reported outcome form (s) for capturing their daily pain 
[ADDRESS_1204522] will 
come for an interim visit at regular intervals (to be determined by 
[CONTACT_941] i nvestigator based on treatment regimen  and standard of 
practice ) to assess subject adherence to treatment , completion of 
patient reported outcomes , NPRS, CGI -I, PGIC and any safety 
concerns and /or changes in c oncomitant treatments/medications.   
After up to [ADDRESS_1204523] the NPRS.  
 
Study  Device  
 The study device is the Provant® Therapy System  which delivers  
Pulsed Electromagnetic Field (PEMF) energy  therapy . Each 
device will be identified by a unique serial  number.  
 
Study Sample  The anticipated enrollment in this study is up to 300 subjects . The 
study will be conducted at multiple  (up to 25)  sites. 
 
Outcome Measures  Outcome measures will be assessed in order to allow for 
characterization of t he response to PEMF therapy.  
 
Efficacy Assessments  
Outcome measures of response to treatment with Provant will be 
determined based on the pain and/or  edema being treated.  The 
initial evaluations will include treatment of post -surgical hand 
edema, arterial insufficiency, diabetic peripheral neuropathy, 
abdominoplasty  and other plastic surgeries , post -hernia surgical 
pain, and pelvic pain.   All outcome measures used as part of the 
standard of practice regimen will be  non-invasive assessments 
e.g., pain scores, SF -36, ankle -foot scales, oxygen perfusion 
(MOXY), and diaries with some subjects.    Protocol required 
assessments will include the NPRS, CGI -I and PGIC.  
Subject adherence  (compliance  with the prescribed treatment 
regimen ) will be assessed verbally during follow -up and upon 
completion of the treatment period.  A subject with complete 
adherence will be expected to ha ve a usage meter reading of 1.[ADDRESS_1204524] s/sites and 95% confidence intervals 
constructed.   
Adver se events will be summarized using MedDRA categories 
and by  [CONTACT_863805] .  Concomitant medications will 
be summarized by [CONTACT_863806].  
This is a n open -label, non -controlled  study with no formal 
hypothesis testing planned.  Data will be collected through an 
Electronic Data Capture system as part of a regi stry to evaluate 
the use of Provant post -market.

 I. INTRODUCTION AND BAC KGROUND  
This study is being conducted to evaluate  the ef fectiveness  of the pulsed electromagnetic  energy 
fields  provided by [CONTACT_863807]® Therapy System (Provant)  to treat pain and edema of multiple 
etiologies .  Provant is a medical device manufactured by [CONTACT_231664], Inc. (Scottsdale, 
AZ), that  has been cleared by [CONTACT_1622]  (K972093, K091791, and K131979)  “for adjunctive use in 
the palliative treatment of post -operative pain and edema of soft tissue.” The device delivers self-
administered, non -thermal, non -ionizing pulsed electromagnetic energy  to the target tissue, using 
27.[ADDRESS_1204528] the treatment site. The device is non -invasive and does not require placement of 
surface or deep electrodes, nor removal of bandages or clothing. Treatment is usually imperceptible 
and very well tolerated. Evidence suggests that Pr ovant can reduce pain, promote healing, and 
promote restored range of motion following reparative surgery in wounded extremities.  [Guo 2011, 
Moffett 2011]  As an analgesic, it is non -addictive and does not alter the mental state  of the user.  
Regenesis Biomedical, Inc ., has marketed Provant  since [ADDRESS_1204529] been administered with rare adverse 
events reported.  [FDA MAUDE Database 2014]  In addition, the safety of PEMF  has been well 
documented. The 2012 meta -analysis by [CONTACT_367584]  [Guo 2012] of 25 clinical trials of PEMF  in 
treatment of pain, edema and wound healing identified no serious adverse events among 1,332 
patients treated with PEMF. In addition, the same meta -analysis found statistically significant 
evidence supporting the efficacy of adjunctive PEMF  therapy for pain relief, edema reducti on, and 
wound healing promotion.  Finally, adjunctive PEMF  therapy has been reported effective in 
alleviating pain resulting  from trauma, [Comorosan 1991, Foley -Nolan 1992, Wilson 19 72, Barclay 
1983, Pennington 1993, Shandles 2002] and chronic pain.  [Foley -Nolan 1990, Wagstaff 1986, 
Brook 2012].  
In vitro and in vivo  evidence  suggest P EMF  functions by [CONTACT_231665]. In vitro  studies  demonstrated that Provant treatment of cells in 
culture can mediate wide -spread changes in transcript levels encoding factors involved in pain and 
the infl ammatory response  (including endogenous opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], growth factors, cytokines, and cell cycle 
regulating factors), [Moffett 2011, Moffett 2012, Rohde 2010] and can promote cell proliferation.  
[George 2002]  Regenesis Biomedical, Inc. scientists recently found  that P EMF  increases 
endogenous opi[INVESTIGATOR_643973], which coincides with an increase in endothelin receptor B in 
keratinocytes, suggesting that P EMF  treatment induces a localized analgesic effect by [CONTACT_643992] -1. [Moffett 20 12a, Moffett 2012b]  These findings have led to the 
proposition that P EMF  activates peripheral endogenous opi[INVESTIGATOR_643974], in turn, activate an analgesic 
cascade via the endothelin pain axis. In a recent clinical study, P EMF  usage for post -operative pain 
not only reduced pain levels and opi[INVESTIGATOR_643975] -treated patients, but was also 
associated with lower IL -1ß levels in post -operative wound exudates.  [Rohde 2010]  Together, these 
[ADDRESS_1204530] that PEMF  therapy reduces pain both by [CONTACT_863808][INVESTIGATOR_2438].  
An exploratory prospective single -arm open -label  IRB-approved  study  was recently conducted at 
four geographically distributed sites using the Provant device to treat persistent postoperat ive 
failed -back surgery syndrome ( FBSS ) pain. Thirty FBSS subjects with moderate to sev ere axial 
back and/or radicular leg pain were treated for 45 days with twice -daily Provant PEMF therapy . 
[Harper 2015] . 
Subjects were eligible for enrollment if they had  a history of 1 or 2 lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_863795]/or radicular leg pain 3 to 36 months (inclusive) following the most recent 
lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_79477], and had a mean Pain Intensity score of 4 or greater (0 -10 numeric pain rating 
scale ) for either axial or radicular pain during a [ADDRESS_1204531] -surgical pain after back surgery.  Provant treatment twice dail y for 45 days 
was associated with improved pain scores, improved overall well -being, improved physical 
function, and reduced analgesic consumption, especially in subjects who had undergone a 
discectomy.   
The purpose of th e current  study is to confirm the findings of pain relief observed in patients 
receiving treatment with Provant  in a “real -world”, post -market setting.  Data from this study may 
be combined with other studies conducted in the post -market setting, i.e., in a patient registry.    
 
 
 
 
 
 
[ADDRESS_1204532] s with pain and/or edema from various 
pain etiologies.   
B. Efficacy Assessments   
Outcome measures of response to treatment with Provant will be determined based on the 
location of the subject ’s treatment area.  Protocol required assessments will include baseline 
and interim  / end of treatment visit and 3 -month follow -up (post -treatment ) pain scores 
using an 11 -point numeric pain rating scale (NPRS), and a Clinical Global Impression – 
Global Improvement (CGI -I) Scale and a Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) 
Scale. All outcome measures used in the i nvestigator ’s standard of practice  are non -invasive 
assessments , e.g., pain scores, SF -36, ankle -foot scales, oxygen perfusion (MOXY), and 
diaries  with some subjects.     
C. Safety  Evaluation  
All observed and reported adverse effects will be recorded by [CONTACT_62063]. Start dates , 
end dates , frequency, severity of the event, any treatment required to  treat the event, and the 
investigator’s judgment on causality and relationship to the device will be assessed for each 
AE. Any AE occurring after the signing of the informed consent form will be recorded. 
Only those AEs occurring after initiation o f the first treatment with the s tudy device will be 
considered treatment -emergent AEs.  
Adverse events will be mapped to preferred terms and body systems using the Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) coding dictionary.  While t he primary 
presentation of adver se events will be subject -based , the number of adverse events will also 
be reported.  The number and percentage of subject s reporting each event will be 
summarized.   Incidence of adverse events by [CONTACT_863809]. Serious adverse events and adverse events leading to discontinuation will be 
displayed.

G. Device Description   
The Provant Therapy System is a solid -state, fixed -power output radio frequency generator 
and transmitter designed to operate at the Federal Communication Commission authorized 
medical device frequency of 27. 12 MHz.  The Provant System’s primary components are 
the Control Unit, the Treatment Applicator that generates and delivers the shortwave RF 
energy, and single -use Disposable Applicator Covers intended to minimize contagion 
transmission and help protect the Treatment Applicator from biological contamination .  Key 
functions and features of these components are as follows:  
1. Control Unit   
The Control Unit contains the main electronics, software, and user interface of the 
Provant System.  The Control Panel ha s a Therapy Start/Stop Switch and two Therapy 
Status Indicators, described below, which are located on the top of the Control Panel , as 
well as a Usage Meter on the side of Control Panel .   
Pressing the Therapy Start/Stop Switch initiates a preset, thirty (30) -minute therapy 
session by [CONTACT_863810] (RFID) Tag interrogation 
and treatment sequence described in greater detail below.  Pressing the Therapy 
Start/Stop Switch again after a therapy session has started will stop the RF energy 
generation.  When pressed, the therapy Start/Stop switch generates an audible tone to 
inform the user that therapy is being initiated or terminated.  
The two Therapy Status Indicators on the Control Panel indicate  when therapy is 
underway and the amount of time (in minutes) remaining in the therapy session.  When 
treatment is initiated, the message “ CPI [INVESTIGATOR_643976] ” is displayed  and green bars scroll 
from l eft to right across the indicator window.  When the thirty -minute therapy session 
is concluded, the generation of RF energy is automatically terminated, the Therapy 
Status Indicator windows go blank, and a brief audible beep is generated to alert the user 
that the treatment is finished. The user will then be  instructed to turn off the Power 
Switch, remove the used Disposable Applicator Cover, and store the Treatment 
Applicator and cable until the next use.    
2. Disposable Applicator Covers.   
The Provant Thera py System features Disposable Applicator Covers, which are placed 
over the Treatment Applicator (described below) before each therapy session.  The 
Disposable Applicator Covers of the Provant Therapy System are single -use-only and 
are intended to minimize contagion transmission and help protect the Treatment 
Applicator from biological contamination .  Embedded in the Disposable Applicator 
[ADDRESS_1204537] before allowing the generation and 
delivery  of the therapeutic RF ener gy.  If the user attempts to reuse a cover, the device 
recognizes the RFID tag on the cover at start up as “used” and will generate an audible 
alert to inform the user to replace the used cover with a new cover.  If the user attempts 
to use the device with out a Disposable Applicator Cover in place over the Treatment 
Applicator, the device will generate an audible alert to remind the user to place a new 
cover.  In either scenario, the Provant Therapy System will not initiate a therapy session 
until a new Dis posable Applicator Cover is in place.  The used Disposable Applicator 
Covers will be discarded as standard (not bio -hazard) waste . 
3. Treatment Applicator Pad  
The Provant Therapy System delivers pulsed RF energy to the desired treatment area 
via a spi[INVESTIGATOR_863796].  The Treatment Applicator Pad 
contains a therapy emitter, an antenna matching circuit, and an RF therapy measuring 
circuit.  The RF therapy measuring circuit automatically detects the level of RF signal 
that is radiated  from the Treatment Applicator Pad and sends this information to the 
controller for the RF Generator.  This feedback circuit is used to regulate the RF therapy 
level, as the RF circuit reactance changes due to changes in body capacitance.  In this 
way, the  correct energy output is constantly monitored, regulate d, and maintained at the 
preset  therapy dose levels.  
The Provant Therapy System generates pulsed RF energy using a highly efficient 
Class -C RF amplifier.  Subjects will receive treatment  consist ing of a pulse duration of 
42 ± 4 microseconds, repeated every 1000 ± 25 microseconds, resulting in an output 
duty cycle of 4.2%, and requiring an average RF forward power level of <[ADDRESS_1204538] RF energy emitted from the Treatment Applicator  Pad is preset 
at 591 ± 44 V/m at a distance of 5.[ADDRESS_1204539] sub -assembly.  If the RF therapy measuring circuit in the Treatment Applicator 
Pad detects an absent or out of range therapy dosage level, treatment will not occur and 
the message “Service Required” will be displayed on the LED in dicator window.  In such 
an event, the Research Center will trouble shoot the issue as instructed in the Instructions 
for U se which accompanies the Study D evice, and if unsuccessful in resolving the 
matter, will contact [CONTACT_643999] a replacement d evice.   
[ADDRESS_1204540] or his/her family or caregiver  in the home or similar setting.  
Subjects will assume a comfortable position and place the treatment applicator  pad of the 
Provan t device on the location as identified by [CONTACT_093] . Treatment will be 
administered  continuously  for [ADDRESS_1204541] logo on the Treatment Applicator Pad is aligned with the same 
logo on the Disposable Applica tor Cover, and the words “This side t oward s patient” will be 
visible through the clear window of the Disposable Applicator Cover.  When applied to the 
treatment area , the side of the Treatment Applicator  Pad with the yellow starburst logo is 
directed toward the treatment location .  Further directions for use of the Provant Therapy 
System are found in the Instruction Manual .  Upon completion of the treatment session, the 
subject will remove and discard the  Disposable Applicator Cover, and store the Provant 
device until the time of the next scheduled treatment session.  Disposable Applicator Covers 
may be discarded as standard waste.  
K. Blinding  
This is a n open -label  study.  No blinding will occur.    
L. Study  Assessments  
1. Efficacy Assessments  
Efficacy assessments conducted  during  the Enrollment Visit (Day  0) and, at a minimum, at 
the completion of treatment  will be collected .  
[ADDRESS_1204542]’s treatment area.  Protocol required assessments will include baseline 
and interim  / end of treatment visit and 3 -month follow -up (post -treatment ) pain scores 
using an 11 -point numeric pain rating scale (NPRS), and a Clinical Global Impression – 
Global Improvement (CGI -I) Scale and a Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) 
Scale. All outcome measures administered as part of non-invasive standard  of practice 
assessments  will be collected , e.g., pain scores, SF -36, ankle -foot scales, oxygen perfusion 
(MOXY), and diaries with some subjects.  
2. Safety  Assessments  
Safety will be assesse d through review of AE reports and concomitant treatment s and 
medica tions . All concomitant drug or non -drug treatments used will be recorded.  Safety 
outcomes will be assessed at office visits  as defined by [CONTACT_209758] .

[ADDRESS_1204547] -treatment changes from baseline. All confidence intervals will use a significance 
level of  5%. 
A. Study  Populations   
Safety summaries  will be conducted on all subjects who undergo treatment.     
The effectiveness  summaries  will also be conducted on all subjects who undergo treatment .  
Subjects that do not a ttend the End of Treatment Visit  will be excluded from the End of 
Treatment analy ses. Subjects who complete the End of Treatment V isit will be assessed for 
efficacy regardless of the number of days of treatment received.  No imputation of data will 
occur.  
B. Efficacy Data Summaries  
Demographic and subject  characteristics will be summarized using descriptive statistics.  
Assessments  that are measured on a continuous scale will be summarized descriptively 
using the mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum value by [CONTACT_5586].

 X. ADVERSE EVENTS AND UNANTICIPATED ADVERS E DEVICE EFFECTS  
A. Adverse Events  
An adverse event is defined as follows:   Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical 
investigation patient administered a medic al device treatment which does not necessarily have to 
have a causal relationship with this treatment.   An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease tempora lly 
associated with th e use of study  device  treatment, whether or not considered related to the study  
device .   
All AEs occurring after signing of the consent form will be recorded. AEs arising subsequent to the 
time of initiation of first trea tment with study  device  will be considered treatment emergent AEs .   
At each contact [CONTACT_1155] , the investigator or designee must seek information on AEs by [CONTACT_105]-
leading specific questioning and, as appropriate, by [CONTACT_5148].   All observed or volunteered AEs, 
regardless of suspected causal relationship to study device, must be recorded in the patient’s chart . 
Any events involving illnesses or injuries with onset during the study or any events involving 
exacerbations of pre -existing illnesses should be recorded.   All clear ly related signs and symptoms 
should be grouped together and recorded as a single diagnosis in the patient’s chart .  A pre -existing 
condition must not be reported as an AE unless the condition worsens during the trial.      
Each AE will be independently jud ged by [CONTACT_231685] .  The following 
definitions will be used for these causality assessments.  
Related:            This causal relationship is assigned when the AE:  
 starts a reasonable time after study device administration,  
 cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_423] ’s clinical state.  
Possibly Related:   This causal relationship is assigned when the AE:  
 starts a reasonable time after study device administration, but  
 could have been produced by [CONTACT_423]’s  clinical state or other 
modes of therapy administered to the subject . 
Unrelated:        This causal relationship is assigned when the AE:  
 is definitely not associated with the study device administered 
and is readily explained by [CONTACT_231686].  
Each AE will also be independently judged by [CONTACT_231687] .  The following 
definitions will be used for these severity  assessments.  
Mild :           The event is transient (<48 hours)  or causes mild discomfort; no medical 
intervention/therapy is required  
Moderate :  The event results in mild to moderate limitation in activity – some assistance 
may be needed; no or minimal medical intervention/therapy is required  
26 
 
710-6505 -01 B  Protocol RBI.2015.005  Version B CONFIDENTIAL  
 Severe :       The event results in marked limitation in activit y, assistance is usually 
required; medical intervention/therapy is required and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_863800] .  A serious 
adverse event ( SAE ) is defined as any untoward med ical occurrence that:  
 Results in death, or  
 Is life -threatening,  
Note: The term “life -threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which 
the subject  was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which 
hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.  
 Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081],  
 Results in permanent impairment of a body function or permanent damage to a body 
structu re,  
 Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect,  
 Necessitates medical or surgical intervention to preclude any one of the outcomes listed 
in this definition . 
All SAEs must be reported  immediately  (within 24 hours of knowledge of the event) by [CONTACT_863815] e following:  
Sponsor Medical Contact – Adrianne P.S. (Patti) Smith , MD; Regenesis Biomedical Inc.  
Mobile: ([PHONE_13388] ; Fax: ([PHONE_13389] ; [EMAIL_12281]  
The investigator  will follow up with a written description of the SAE submitted to the sponsor 
within 3 days, including the results of the SAE investigation and any treatment(s) provided.  
All adverse events will be followed until resolution or until the investigator asse sses the subject’s  
status has returned to normal.  
B. Anticipated  Adverse Device Effects Associated with Provant  
Anticipated adverse event s associated with Provant , reported at least o nce since market launch in 2004,  
are as follows:  
 Device fails to operate  
 Warmth or burning at treatment site    
 Skin reaction at treatment site (tingling, pi[INVESTIGATOR_2115] -and-needles, rash, blisters, swelling, dry skin, 
redness, numbness, sensation of warmth)  
 Increased bleeding at surgical site  
 Chilliness  
 Headache  
 Malaise

 Excessive menstruation  
C. Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect (UADE)  
Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect means any serious adverse effect on health or safety or any 
life-threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with, a device, if that effect, problem, or 
death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the protocol or 
informed consent form , or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with the device that 
relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects .   
All UADE s must be reported  immediately  (within 24 hours of knowledge of the event) by [CONTACT_231689]:  
Sponsor Medical Contact – Adrianne P.S. (Patti) Smith , MD; Regenesis Biomedical Inc.; 
Mobile: ([PHONE_13388] ; Fax: ([PHONE_13389] ; [EMAIL_12281]  
The investigator  will follow up with a written description of the UADE  submitted to the sponsor 
within 3 days , including the results of the UADE investigation and any treatment(s) provided.  
Any UADE  occurring up to the date of the final Follow -up Visit will be followed until it resolves, 
the investigator assesses the subject’s  status to have returned to baseline, or until the investigator 
feels that the event is stable and chronic.  
The investigator shall submit to the reviewing IRB a report of any UADE occurring during an 
investigation as soon as possible in accordance with the IRB submission guidelines, but in no event 
later than [ADDRESS_1204548].  
XI. INVESTIGATOR’S  FILES/RETENTION OF DOCUMENTS  
The investigator must maintain adequate and accurate records to enable the conduct of the study to 
be fully documented  and the study data to be subsequently verified.  These documents should be 
classified into two different separate categories (1) Investigator’s Study File, and (2) Subject  
clinical source documents. The Investigator’s Study File will contain the protocol/amendments, 
data collection forms , Independent Ethics Committee/Institutional Review Board and governmental 
approval with correspondence, sample informed consent, device re cords, staff curriculum vitae and 
28 
 
710-6505 -01 B  Protocol RBI.2015.005  Version B CONFIDENTIAL  
 authorization forms and other appropriate documents/correspondence. All records defined  in [ADDRESS_1204549]  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/clinic records, physician’s and nur se’s 
notes, appointment book, original lab reports, special assessment reports, signed informed consent 
forms, subject  screening and enrollment logs.   
The investigator  must keep these two categories of documents on file for at least [ADDRESS_1204550] of the following: completion, discontinuation of the study, or the regulatory submission for 
which the study is being performed is no longer under review.  After that period of time the 
documents may be destroyed, subject  to local regulations.  
Should th e investigator  wish to assign the study records to another party or move them to another 
location, Regenesis  Biomedical, Inc.  must be notified in advance.  
If the investigator  cannot guarantee this archiving requirement at the investigational site for any o r 
all of the documents, special arrangements must be made between the investigator  and Regenesis  
Biomedical, Inc.  to store these in a sealed container(s) off-site so that they can be returned sealed 
to the investigator  in case of a regulatory audit.  Where  source documents are required for the 
continued care of the subject , appropriate copi[INVESTIGATOR_231654].  
A. Source Documents and Background Data  
The investigator shall supply the sponsor on request with any required background data   
from the study documentation or clinic records.  This is particularly important when data 
requires clarification .  In case of special problems/and or governmental quer ies or requests 
for audit inspections, it is also necessary to have access to the complete study records, 
provided that subject  confidentiality is protected.   
All forms should be typed or filled out using indelible ink, and must be legible.  Errors 
should be crossed out but not obliterated, the correction inserted, and the change initialed 
and dated by [CONTACT_15009]/her authorized delegate.   
B. Audits and Inspections  
The investigator should understand that source documents for this trial should be m ade 
available to appropriately qualified personnel from the Regenesis  Biomedical, Inc.  Quality 
Assurance Unit or its designees or to health authority inspectors after appropriate 
notification.  The verification of the data must be by [CONTACT_644011] s ource documents  
and patient charts . 
XII. MONITORING THE STUDY  
It is understood that the responsible Regenesis  Biomedical, Inc.  monitor (or designee) may contact 
[CONTACT_863816], upon request, to inspect the various records of the 
trial provided that subject  confidentiality is maintained in accord with local requirements.  
[ADDRESS_1204551]  records needed.  The investigator (or his/her designee ) agrees to cooperate 
with the monitor to ensure that any problems detected in the course of these monitoring visits are 
resolved.  
XIII.  CONFIDENTIALITY OF T RIAL DOCUMENTS AND SUBJECT  RECORDS  
The investigator must assure that subject s’ anonymity will be maintained and that their identities 
are protected from unauthorized parties.  On documents submitted to the sponsor, subject s shou ld 
not be identified by [CONTACT_2249], but by [CONTACT_1209].  The investigator should keep a 
subject  enrollment log showing codes, names and addresses.  The investigator should maintain 
documents not for submission to Regenesis Biomedical, Inc. , e.g., subject s’ written consent forms, 
in strict confidence.  
XIV. PUBLICATION OF DATA AND PROTECTION OF TR ADE SECRETS  
The results of this study may be published or presented at scientific meetings.  If this is foreseen, 
the investigator agrees to submit all manusc ripts or abstracts to Regenesis Biomedical, Inc.  at least 
[ADDRESS_1204552] editorial and ethical practice,  Regenesis Biomedical, Inc.  will generally 
support publication of multicenter trials only in their entirety and not as individual center data.  In 
this case, a coordinating investigator [INVESTIGATOR_12992].  Any formal

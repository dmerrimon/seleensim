Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
Protocol  MO29518, Version  8 2 PROTOCOL AMENDMENT, VERSION 8: RAT IO NALE  
Specific changes in Version 8 of Protocol MO29518 and their rationale are as follows:  
• Appendix 8: updated to include the changes  in the Atezolizumab Investigator’s 
Brochure version 15 (IB v15), including the guidelines for management of immune -
mediated myositis  and for suspected hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis or 
macrophage activation syndrome, removed description and management guidelines for 
systemic immune activation, updated terminology changing "immune -related" to 
"immune -mediated"  (and wherever applicable throughout the protocol) . 
• Clarified provisions for post -trial access to atezolizumab to allow for continued 
treatment of patients following last patient last visit (LPLV), and regarding data 
collection during transition to the  extension study . 
• Change in Medical Monitor  and addition of NCT number.  
• Terminology update to align with recent changes in the atezolizumab IB v15 changed "immune -related" to "immune- mediated" . 
Substantive new information appears in italics. This amendment represents cumulative changes to the original protocol.

SUMM ARY OF CHANGES  
 
5.2.[ADDRESS_272562] (Immediately Reportable 
to the Sponsor)  
Update of Non -Serious Adverse Events of Special Interest ( AESI ) to align with 
Atezolizumab IB v15 and protocols across the Atezolizumab programme, adding AESIs 
identified more recently and minor terminology updates.  
5.1.4  Management of Specific Adverse Events   
Remov al of term,  description and management guidelines for systemic immune 
activation (SIA), and addition of  the terms hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis ( HLH) 
and macrophage activation syndrome ( MAS) as potential risks, together with diagnostic 
criteria and management guidelines for HLH and MAS . 
SIA was defined by [CONTACT_226823][INVESTIGATOR_014] (immune- doublets)  
characterized as systemic inflammation with fever, elevated inflammatory markers  and 
multiple organ dysfunction in the absence of other etiologies. It was considered a clinical  
entity separate from other similar systemic immune entities (HLH ) and (MAS) etc.  As of 
today,  SIA remains a [COMPANY_002] specific term and is not widely used in the medical  
community. It is a potential risk for Atezolizumab. The event is not described in the literature, hence no common definition or established guidelines for SIA exist unlike 
other established entities [HLH, MAS, or cytokine release syndrome (CRS)]. Evolving 
knowledge of safety  profile of checkpoint inhibitors and a recent review of reported SlA 
cases conducted by [CONTACT_226824] (e.g. HLH, 
MAS,  CRS). The current guidance in the IB and protocols for Atezolizumab has led to 
cases being reported as SIA (single agent  atezolizumab or in combinations) even though 
meeting the criteria of other immune entities  such as HLH, MAS or CRS.  The IB  version 
15 and amendments of  protocols and ICFs for Atezolizumab remove the term systemic 
immune activation (SIA) , and add the terms HLH and MAS as potential risks, together 
with diagnostic criteria and management guidelines for HLH and MAS . 
[IP_ADDRESS] Systemic Immune Activation  
Systemic immune activation (SIA) is a rare condition characterized by [CONTACT_226825].  Given the mechanism of action of Atezolizumab, SIA is considered a 
potential risk when given with other immunomodulating agents.  SIA should be included 
in the differential diagnosis for patients who, in the absence of an alternative etiology, 
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
Protocol  MO29518, Version  8 4 develop a sepsis like syndrome after administration of Atezolizumab, and the initial 
evaluation should include the following:  
• CBC with peripheral smear  
• PT, PTT, fibrinogen, and D dimer  
• Ferritin  
• Triglycerides  
• AST, ALT, and total bilirubin 
• LDH 
• Complete neurologic and abdominal examination (assess for hepatosplenomegaly)  
If SIA is still suspected after the initial evaluation, contact [CONTACT_226826].  
 
5.3.[ADDRESS_272563] -trial access to atezolizumab to allow for 
continued treatment of patients following LPLV, and regarding data collection during 
transition to the extension study.  
Patients may also take part in an extension study if the patient is still benefiting from treatment (defined as no registered PD) at the time of planned Last Patient Last Visit date. If the extension study is not set -up in time for the patient to roll over by 
[CONTACT_226827], nor is there a Post -Trial Access Program available, 
the patient can continue treatment in the study until the extension study is opened at 
the patient’s site. During the interim period between LPLV and a patient rolling over 
to the extension study, only safety data (AE including SAE and AESI) will continue to be collected in the eCRF. Other assessments (e.g. tumor assessment) can be performed as per standard of care. 
 
 
APPENDIX 1: Schedule of Assessments 
Added footnote 24 to clarify assessments  during transition to the extension study  
following LPLV . 
 
During the interim period between LPLV and a patient rolling over to the extension 
study, only safety data (AE including SAE and AESI) will continue to be collected in the eCRF. Other assessments (e.g. tumor assessment) can be performed as per 
standard of care.  
  
APPENDIX 2: Schedule of Anti -Therapeutic Antibody, Pharmacodynamic and 
Pharmacokinetic Assessments 
Addition to footnote 2 to clarify sample collection during transition to the extension study  
following LPLV . 
 
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
Protocol  MO29518, Version  8 5 For patients who discontinue the study treatment, ATA and PK samples are to be 
obtained at 120 days ± [ADDRESS_272564] dose of study treatment unless the patient dies or withdraws consent or the study closes (during the interim period between LPLV and a patient rolling over to the extension study, ATA and PK samples do not need to be collected) .  
 
 
APPENDIX 8: Risks Associated with Atezolizumab and Guidelines for Management of Adverse Events Associated with Atezolizumab  
Added guidelines for management  of immune -mediated myositis  and for suspected 
hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis or macrophage activation syndrome (see rationale 
above) , and updated terminology changing "immune -related" to "immune- mediated" .
 
 
IMMUNE -MEDIATED MYOSITIS  
Immune -mediated myositis has been associated with the administration of 
atezolizumab.  Myositis or inflammatory myopathies are a group of disorders 
sharing the common feature of inflammatory muscle injury; dermatomyositis and 
polymyositis are among the most common disorders. Initial diagnosis is based on 
clinical (muscle weakness, muscle pain, skin rash in dermatomyositis), biochemical 
(serum creatine kinase increase), and imaging (electromyography/MRI) features, 
and is confirmed with a muscle biopsy. 
Patie nts with signs and symptoms of myositis, in the absence of an identified 
alternate etiology, should be treated according to the guidelines in Table 13.

Protocol  MO29518, Version  8 8 HEMOPHAGOCYTIC LYMPHOHISTIOCYTOSIS AND MACROPHAGE 
ACTIVATION SYNDROME  
Immune -mediated reactions may involve any organ system and may lead to 
hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) and macrophage activation syndrome 
(MAS).   
Patients with suspected HLH should be diagnosed according to published criteria by 
[CONTACT_70195] (2014).  A patient should be classified as having HLH if five of the following eight criteria are met: 
• Fever  
≥ 38.5°C  
• Splenomegaly  
• Peripheral blood cytopenia consisting of at least two of the following:  
– Hemoglobin < 90 g/L (9 g/dL) (< 100 g/L [10 g/dL] for infants < 4 weeks old)  
– Platel et count < 100  × 109/L (100,000/ µL) 
– ANC < 1.0  × 109/L (1000/µL) 
• Fasting triglycerides > 2.992 mmol/L (265 mg/dL)  and/or  fibrinogen < 1.5 g/L 
(150 mg/dL)  
• Hemophagocytosis in bone marrow, spleen, lymph node, or liver  
• Low or absent natural killer cell activity  
• Ferritin > 500 mg/L (500 ng/mL)  
• Soluble interleukin 2 (IL- 2) receptor (soluble CD25) elevated ≥ [ADDRESS_272569] 
deviations above age- adjusted laboratory -specific norms 
 
Patients with suspected MAS should be diagnosed according to published criteria 
for systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis by [CONTACT_70196]. (2016).  A febrile patient 
should be classified as having MAS if the following criteria are met:  
• Ferritin > 684 mg/L (684 ng/mL)  
• At least two of the following:  
– Platelet count ≤ 181  × 109/L (181,000/ µL) 
– AST ≥ 48 U/L 
– Triglycerides > 1.761 mmol/L (156 mg/dL)  
– Fibrinogen ≤ 3.6 g/L (360 mg/dL)  
 
Patients with suspected HLH or MAS should be treated according to the guidelines 
in Table 14.

In addition, only patients whose tissue is available for biomarker assessment testing will be 
eligible.   
Enrolled patients will receive Atezolizumab at a fixed dose of [ADDRESS_272587] day of each cycle.  One cycle of therapy will be defined as 21 days 
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
Protocol  MO29518, Version  8 22 (± 3 days).  Patients treated with Atezolizumab who have no post -baseline tumor assessment 
(per protocol mandated timelines), and enrolled patients who do not receive any dose of 
Atezolizumab will be replaced.    
Atezolizumab treatment may be continued as long as patients are experiencing clinical benefit, as assessed by [CONTACT_2413], in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or symptomatic deterioration attributed to disease progression after an integrated assessment of radiogr aphic 
data, biopsy results (if available) and clinical status . 
Patients will be permitted to continue Atezolizumab treatment after RECIST v1.1 criteria (or 
disease- specific criteria for patients with prostate cancer [Appendix 6] and malignant pleural 
mesot helioma [Appendix 7]) for progressive disease are met if they meet all of  the following 
criteria:  
• Evidence of clinical benefit as assessed by [CONTACT_737]  
• Absence of symptoms and signs (including worsening of laboratory values, e.g., new or 
worsening hypercalcemia) indicating unequivocal progression of disease  
• No decline in ECOG performance status that can be attributed to disease progression 
• Absence of tumor progression at critical anatomical sites (e.g., leptomeningeal disease) that 
cannot be managed by [CONTACT_990] -allowed medical interventions  
 
Patients treated with Atezolizumab in whom radiographic disease progression is confirmed at a subsequent tumor assessment may be considered for continued study treatment at the 
discretion of the Investigator if they continue to meet the above criteria.  
If an individual patient continues to experience clinical benefit beyond 2 years of radiologic 
progressive disease, it lies within the discretion of each investigator to continue study treatment 
based on a positive risk benefit assessment by [CONTACT_093].  
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate Investigator -determined non- progression rate 
(NPR) at [ADDRESS_272588], v1.1 (except for prostate cancer and 
malignant pleural mesothelioma) and disease- specific criteria for patients with prostate cancer 
(see Appendix 6) and malignant pleural mesothelioma (see Appendix 7).  Secondary efficacy 
variables (including ORR, BOR, CBR, DOR, TTP and PFS) will be recorded using RECIST, 
v1. 1, (except for prostate cancer and malignant pleural mesothelioma) and disease- specific 
criteria for patients with prostate cancer (see Appendix 6) and malignant pleural mesothelioma (see Appendix 7), and modified RECIST  (see Appendix 3)  
Safety will be monitored by [CONTACT_19693], serious AEs (SAEs), AEs of special 
interest  (AESIs), laboratory findings and electrocardiogram.  The National Cancer Institute 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, Version 4.0 (NCI CTCAE, v4.0) will be used 
to quantify the intensity of AEs occurring during treatment.  Incidence, type and severity of AEs, SAEs, incidence of AEs and SAEs leading to Atezolizumab interruption or discontinuation and 
cause of death will be reported.  In addition, to characterize the immunogenic  potential and the 
pharmacokinetic properties of Atezolizumab, blood samples will be taken at various time points 
before and after study treatment administration (see Appendix 2 for a detailed description of the assessments).  
This study will also have an exploratory analysis examining biomarkers. These analyses will be conducted on archival tissue specimens (required for patient inclusion), as well as prospectively -collected plasma/blood samples and freshly obtained tumor specimens.  
Collected samples will be analyzed at a central laboratory for PD -L1 expression, as well as 
other potential markers (e.g. but not limited to protein or genetic markers), to assess relationships between biomarker expression and patient outcomes including, but not limited to, response and disease progression.  
All patients will be monitored for survival for a minimum period of [ADDRESS_272589].   S urvival 
follow -up information will be collected via clinic visits, telephone calls and/or review of patient 
medical records approximately every 3 months from study treatment discontinuation until patient  
death, loss to follow -up, withdrawal of consent or until the study is terminated by [CONTACT_1034].  
Patients who discontinue study treatment for reasons other than disease progression (e.g., 
toxicity) should continue to undergo scheduled tumor assessments approximately every 3 
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
Protocol  MO29518, Version  [ADDRESS_272590].  
Enrollment in this study will be based on Simon's optimal two- stage design (Simon 1989).  
Accordingly, [ADDRESS_272591] stage.  If 3 or 
more of these patients exhibit non- progressive disease at the end of Stage I, then an additional 
13 fully -evaluable patients will be enrolled in Stage II.  Thus, approxim ately 725 patients are 
expected to participate in the study. However, if positive efficacy signals are observed in any of 
the other cohorts that include different tumor types or in a specific subgroup of patients within 
other cohorts  (e.g. biomarker positive subgroup), the Sponsor in discussion with the Steering 
Committee may decide to extend the enrolment of the individual tumor type or subgroup of patients based on methodology explained in the Determination of Sample Size (Section 6.1).  
 
Please refer to the Schedule of Assessments (Appendix 1) for a detailed description of the 
assessments to be carried out in this study.  
 
Number of Patients  
Based on Simon’s optimal two- stage design (Simon 1989), approximately 12 to 25 fully 
evaluable patients per individual tumor type will be included.  
Allowing for expansion of cohorts into further sub- cohorts of individual tumor types and possible 
further expansion into subgroups of responders, the projected total number of patients enrolled 
in this study is approximately 725.  However, cohorts may be expanded under certain conditions 
(see Section 6.1).

Investigational Medicinal Products  
Test Product (Investigational Drug)  
The dose of Atezolizumab in this study will be 1200 mg (equivalent to an average body weight -
based dose of 15 mg/kg) administered by [CONTACT_162147] 3 weeks (21 [± 3] days).  
Administration of Atezolizumab will be performed in a setting with emergency medical facil ities 
and staff who are trained to monitor for and respond to medical emergencies.  
Atezolizumab will be delivered in 250 mL 0.9% NaCl IV infusion bags with product contact[CONTACT_226837] (PVC) or polyolefin (PO) and IV infusion lines with product contact[CONTACT_226838] (PE) and 0.2 µm in- line filters (filter membrane of 
polyethersulfone [PES]).  No incompatibilities have been observed between Atezolizumab and 
these infusion materials (bags and infusion lines).  
The ini tial dose of Atezolizumab will be delivered over 60 (± 15) minutes.  If the first infusion is 
tolerated without infusion- associated adverse events, the second infusion may be delivered 
over 30 (± 10) minutes.  If the 30- minute infusion is well tolerated, all subsequent infusions may 
be delivered over 30 (± 10) minutes.  
For first infusion of study treatment, the patient’s vital signs must be determined within 
60 minutes before the infusion; during, and after the infusion if clinically indicated.  For 
subsequent infusions, vital signs will be collected within [ADDRESS_272603] dose of Atezolizumab. Premedication may be 
administered for Cycles  ≥ 2 at the discretion of the treating physician.  The management of 
infusion- related reactions  will be according to severity as described in section 5.1.4.  
 
For anaphylaxis precautions, see Appendix 4.  
Guidelines for dosage modification, treatment interruption or discontinuation and the management of specific adverse events are provided in Sections  5.1.3 and in the Atezolizumab 
Investigator’s Brochure.  
Any overdose or incorrect administration of study drug should be noted on the Study Drug 
Administration electronic Case Report Form (eCRF).  AEs associated with an overdose or 
incorrect administration of study drug should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.

Protocol  MO29518, Version  [ADDRESS_272604], v1.1 (except for prostate cancer and malignant pleural 
mesothelioma) and disease- specific criteria for  patients with prostate cancer (see Appendix 6) 
and malignant pleural mesothelioma (see Appendix 7).  This endpoint will be assessed at Stage 
I and Stage II.  
At the conclusion of this study, Atezolizumab will be declared effective or ineffective for each 
cohort based on rules for Stage II.  
The final analysis for each cohort will take place when all patients in that cohort have been 
followed for survival for a minimum of [ADDRESS_272605].  In this Phase II study, an NPR of 20% is a level of activity that is not of 
interest for further clinical development, whereas an NPR of 40% is of clinical interest.  
The study hypotheses are:  
• H 0: π  ≤ π 0 
• H 1: π > π 1 
 Where π
0 = 20% and the assumed NPR under the alternative is π 1 = 40%.  
The type I error will be 10% and the study will have 80% power to reject the null hypothesis 
when the true NPR is 40%.  
The hypothesis and clinical assumptions will be applied to all cohorts separately.  
 
Determination of Sample Size   
The sample size for this phase II study is based on Simon’s optimal two- stage design (Simon 
1989).  
In this Phase II study, an NPR of 20% is a level of activity that is not of interest for further 
clinical development, whereas an NPR of 40% is of clinical interest.  The type I error will be 10% and the study will have 80% power to reject the null hypothesis when the true NPR is 40%.  
The Simon design in this study requires [ADDRESS_272606] stage there are 0, 1 or 2 patients with non- progressive disease at Week 18, the 
enrollment into this cohort will be terminated (or the cohort may be expanded as described 
below).  Otherwise, if more than [ADDRESS_272607] -baseline- (per protocol mandated timelines).  Thus, 
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
Protocol  MO29518, Version  8 31 more than 25 patients may be needed to be enrolled per cohort to obtain 25 fully -evaluable 
patients.  
The hypotheses and clinical assumptions will be applied to all cohorts individually.  
Statistical analyses will be based on patients with the same individual tumor type and may be 
based on pre- defined cohorts or on sub- cohorts.  
Allowing for expansion of cohorts into further sub- cohorts of individual tumor types and possible 
further expansion into subgroups of responders, the projected total number of patients enrolled in this study is approximately 725 (see Figure 2).   
If a clear clinical benefit has been observed for a defined subgroup of patients at the end of 
Stage I within a cohort that did not meet the criteria for continuation (as described in Section 6.2.1), then enrolment into Stage II might still be allowed in this cohort for this specific subgroup after discussion with the Sponsor and the study Steering Committee. Similarly, if a clear clinical 
benefit has been observed for a defined subgroup of patients at the end of Stage II within a 
cohort that did not meet the criteria for success (as described in Section 6.2.2), then enrolment into Stage II might continue in this cohort for this specific subgroup after discussion with the Sponsor and the study Steering Committee.

• The total estimated annual incidence of soft tissue and visceral sarcomas in Europe is 4– 5/100,000 (approximately 
1% of all adult cancers).  In the US, the incidence of soft 
tissue and visceral sarcoma is 3.8 per 100,000 and the mortality rate is 1.5 per 100,000. The incidence of bone sarcoma is 0.9 per 100,000 and mortality is 0.4 per 100,000 
• About 12,020 new soft tissue and visceral sarcomas and about 2,300 new cases of bone sarcoma were diagnosed in the US in 2014 and about 4,740 and 1,500 people died from  soft tissue and bone sarcomas, respectively  
• Approximately half of all patients with intermediate or high-grade tumors develop metastatic disease requiring systemic treatment.  The 5- year survival rate is around 10% for soft 
tissue sarcoma ( STS) that have metastasized.  After failure 
of first -line treatment the estimated 6- month progression- free 
survival rate is only 14% for agents deemed to be active in sarcoma 
• The 5- year survival rate for osteosarcoma with unresectable

• The incidence varies substantially worldwide, with the highest known rates in Northeast Thailand (>  80 per 100,000) and 
much lower rates in the Western world (e.g., Canada, 0.3 per 100,000)  
• Incidence rates are rising around the world.  For example, 
incidence rates in the US increased from 0.3 per 100,000 in 1975– 79 to 0.9 per 100,000 in 1995– 99 
• The 5- year survival rate is 30% for localized disease, 24% for

50% at 5- year for metastatic disease 
• Medullary thyroid cancer makes up about 5 % to 10% of all thyroid cancers and has a 10- year survival rate of 75% ; 
however, the 5- year survival rate is 5% for metastatic 
disease 
• Anaplastic thyroid cancer has an estimated incidence of 0.21 per 100,000 person- years, and comprises <  2% of all thyroid 
cancers. More women than men are affected (2– 3:1). The 5-

(Oosterhuis et al, 2005)  • Germ cell tumors (GCT) include a group of gonadal and 
extragonadal tumors that are considered as one disease with separate entities that can manifest themselves in different anatomical sites. In men testi cular germ cell tumors (TGCT) 
are the most common GCTs, whilst in women the most 
common are of ovarian origin. GCTs occur mostly in young adults and children. Malignant GCTs are rare, comprising only 0.7% of all cancers  
• GCTs account for 95 percent of testicular cancers and the terms “testicular cancer” and TGCT are often used interchangeably. The global incidence rate of testicular 
cancer is 1.[ADDRESS_272615] been declining. In the US, the 5- year survival rate is over 95%  
• Female GCTs are rare. They are mostly of ovarian origin. The estimated incidence rate is about 0.3 per 100,000 women- years. The 5- year relative survival is about 84%  
• Extragonadal GCTs are very rare tumors that predominantly affect young males

Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
Protocol  MO29518, Version  8 43 1.2 BACKGROUND ON ATEZOL IZUM AB  
Atezolizumab is a phage- derived human immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 monoclonal antibody 
consisting of two heavy chains (448 amino acids) and two light chains (214 amino acids).  
Atezolizumab was engineered to eliminate Fc -effector function via a single amino acid 
substitution (asparagine to alanine) at position 298 on the heavy chain, which results in a 
non-glycosylated heavy chain that has minimal binding to Fc receptors and prevents Fc -
effector function at expected concentrations and eliminates the potential for antibody -
dependent cell -mediated cytotoxicity.  Atezolizumab targets human PD -L1 and inhibits 
its interaction with its receptors, programmed death−1 (PD -1) and B7.1 (CD80, B7- 1).  
Both of these interactions are reported to provide inhibitory signals to T cells.  
Atezolizumab is being investigated as a potential therapy against  solid tumors and 
hematologic malignancies in humans.  
1.2.1  Nonclinical Studies  
The safety, pharmacokinetic (PK) and toxicokinetics of Atezolizumab were investigated 
in mice and cynomolgus monkeys to support intravenous (IV) administration and to aid 
in predicti ng the appropriate starting dose in humans.  Given the similar binding of 
Atezolizumab for cynomolgus monkey and human PD -L1, the cynomolgus monkey was 
selected as the primary and relevant nonclinical model for understanding the safety, PK 
and toxicokinetics of Atezolizumab.  
Overall, the nonclinical pharmacokinetics and toxicokinetics observed for Atezolizumab 
supported entry into clinical studies, including providing adequate safety factors for the 
proposed Phase I starting doses.  The results of the toxicology program were consistent 
with the anticipated pharmacologic activity of down- modulating the PD -L1/PD -[ADDRESS_272616] 
and supported entry into clinical trials in patients.  
Please refer to the Atezolizumab Investigator’s Brochure for details on the nonclinical studies.  
1.2.2  Ongoing Clinical Studies  
Atezolizumab is currently being tested in multiple Phase I, II and III studies, both as 
monotherapy and in combination with several anti -cancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (see the 
Atezolizumab Investigator’s Brochure for study descriptions).  Much of the safety and 
efficacy data summarized below are from the Phase Ia Study PCD4989g, a multicenter, first-in-human, open -label, dose -escalation trial evaluating the safety, tolerability, 
immunogenicity, pharmacokinetics, exploratory pharmacodynamics and preliminary evidence of biologic activity of Atezolizumab administered as a single agent by [CONTACT_33433] 3 weeks (q3w) to patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid malignancies or hematologic malignancies.

Protocol  MO29518, Version  8 44 1.2.3  Clinical Safety  
As of t he cutoff date for the Investigator ’s Brochure version 9, Atezolizumab, (August 
2016) has been administered to approximately 6053 patients with solid tumors and 
hematologic  malignancies.   
Safety information for Atezolizumab is also gleaned from studies in the entire 
development program, including those where Atezolizumab is investigated in 
combination with other unapproved agents.  
Study PCD4989g, in which Atezolizumab is being used as a single agent in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors or hematologic malignancies, provides the majority of data (with 558 safety evaluable patients as of the data extraction date of 11 May 2015)  for the safety profile of Atezolizumab as monotherapy. Currently, no 
maximum tolerated dose, no dose- limiting t oxicities and no clear dose- related trends in 
the incidence of AEs have been determined. Fatigue, decreased appetite, nausea and cough were commonly reported adverse events in single and combination therapy. The overall immune- mediated adverse events reported for Atezolizumab were considered 
moderate in severity and majority of patients were able to continue on Atezolizumab therapy.  
A dverse Events  
In PCD4989g of the 558 safety evaluable treated patients 376 patients (67.4%) reported at least one treatment -related adverse event, Grade 3 - 4 AEs were reported in 239 
patients (42.8%) of which 66 (11.8%) were considered related. Grade 3 and 4 AEs 
considered related by [CONTACT_226840], pneumonitis, increased alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT), increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST), increased gamma -glutamyl transferase (GGT), lymphocyte count decreased, cardiac tamponade, 
asthenia, autoimmune hepatitis, pneumonia, influenza, and hypoxia. More detailed 
information is provided in the latest version of the IB.  
Immune -mediated A dverse Events  
Given the mechanism of action of Atezolizumab, events associated with inflammation 
and/or immune- mediated adverse events have been closely monitored during the 
Atezolizumab clinical program.  These include potential dermatologic, hepatic, endocrine 
and respi[INVESTIGATOR_29343].  Events of immune- related hepatitis, pneumonitis, colitis, 
pancreatitis, diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, adrenal insufficiency, 
hypophysitis,  Guillain -Barré syndrome, myasthenic syndrome  / myasthenia gravis, 
meningoencephalitis and infusion -related reactions  are considered adverse drug 
reactions associated with Atezolizumab.

Anti-tumor activity, including Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 
(RECIST)−based responses (i.e., RECIST v1.1 responses), have been observed in 
patients with different tumor types treated with Atezolizumab monotherapy in 
Study  PCD4989g.  
Among 345 evaluable patients treated by 21 October 2013 (data cutoff of 21 April 2014) 
with a median 30.[ADDRESS_272617] 
v1.1 at an ORR of 18% (95% CI: 14.1%−22.3%).  Objective responses with 
Atezolizumab monotherapy were observed in a broad range of malignancies including NSCLC, RCC, melanoma, bladder cancer, colorectal cancer, head and neck cancer, gastric cancer, breast cancer, and sarcoma.  The majority of the responses have been 
durable, with a median DOR of 77.6 weeks (range: 6.4+ to 97.9+ weeks, where “+” 
denotes a censored value); 72.6% (45 of 62 patients) of these responses were ongoing as of the clinical cutoff date.  
Please refer to the Atezolizumab Investigator’s Brochure for details on clinical activity in 
all patients treated to date regardless of tumor type.  
NSCLC 
As of the [ADDRESS_272618] dose of Atezolizumab by 21 October 2013 were 
evaluable for efficacy.  The median age was 60.5 years.  The group represented a heavily pre- treated patient population in that 84.1% of the patients had received ≥ [ADDRESS_272619] responses (confirmed) were observed in a total of 18 patients, inclusive of 
squamous and non- squamous histologies, and across all treatment cohorts (treatment 
dose levels of 1 to 20 mg/kg).  
Prelimin ary results suggest that PD -L1 expression in tumor tissue is likely to be 
associated with response to Atezolizumab.  A prototype IHC assay was used to measure 
specific PD -L1 signals in TCs and ICs.  PD -L1 staining categories in TCs were defined 
as TC0, TC1, TC2, and TC3, and in ICs were defined as IC0, IC1, IC2, and IC3.  Of note, 
an ORR of 50% (11 of 22 patients, 95% CI: 28.2%− 71.8%) and an ORR of 31.6% (12 of 
38, 95% CI: 17.5%−48.6%) were observed in patients whose tumors were characterized by [CONTACT_226841] s of PD -L1 staining in TCs or ICs (TC3 or IC3 group and TC3 or IC2/3 group, 
respectively) compared with an ORR of 12.1% (7 of 58 patients, 95% CI: 5.7%−22.5%) 
in patients with low or no PD -L1 staining in TCs and ICs (TC0/1/2 and IC0/1/2 group) 
(Table 2).  
As of the data cutoff of [ADDRESS_272620] continued to 
respond after 13.0+ weeks to 97.9+ weeks.  The median DOR is 66.9 weeks.  See the

Urothelial Bladder Cancer  
As of the clinical cut -off date of 21 April 2014,  efficacy analyses had been performed on 
70 patients (33 IHC 2/3, 36 IHC 0/1 and 1 unknown) with locally -advanced or metastatic 
urothelial bladder cancer (UBC) (all patients were dosed by 27 January 2014 and had a 
minimum of 12 weeks of follow -up).  In these 70 patients, the median age was 65 years 
(range: 36−89 years).  Sixty -four patients (91%) had received prior platinum -based 
chemotherapy.  The majority of patients had at least one or more poor prognostic features (i.e., hemoglobin < 10 g/dL, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group [ECOG] performance status [PS] ≥ 1, liver involvement) at baseline, with 52 patients (74%) 
having visceral metastases.  
Among the 33 efficacy -evaluable IHC 2/3 patients, median follow -up was 6 months

Renal Cell Carcinoma  
As of the clinical cut -off date of 21 April 2014, efficacy analyses had been performed on 
69 patients with RCC (all patients were dosed by 21 October 2013).  In these 69 patients, 
the median age was 61 years (range: 33−81 years).  Sixty patients (87%) had received prior systemic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], including cytokine -based therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]  (39%), tyrosine kinase 
inhibitors (58%) and mTOR inhibitors (25%).  Eighteen patients (26%) were in the Memorial Sloan- Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) poor risk stratification group, while 
71%, 23%, 35% and 4% of patients at enrolment had metastases in the lung, liver, bone and brain, respectivel y.  
Among the 69 efficacy -evaluable patients, the median follow -up was 239 days (range: 
21 to 834 days).  The investigator -assessed ORR (confirmed) per RECIST, v1.1, was 15% 
(95% CI: 8%, 25%), including 1 CR.  The ORRs in the IHC 1/2/3 and IHC 0 groups wer e

1.2.5  Clinical Pharmacokinetics  
On the basis of available preliminary PK data (0.03−20 mg/kg), Atezolizumab appeared to show linear pharmacokineti cs at doses ≥ 1 mg/kg.  For the 1- mg/kg and 20- mg/kg 
dose groups, the mean apparent clearance (CL) and the mean volume of distribution at 
steady state (Vss) had a range of 3.11 to 4.14 mL/kg and 48.1 to 67.0 mL/kg, 
respectively, which is consistent with th e expected profile of an IgG1 antibody in humans.  
The development of anti -therapeutic antibodies (ATAs) has been observed in patients in 
all dose cohorts and was associated with changes in pharmacokinetics for some patients in the lower dose cohorts (0.3, 1, and 3 mg/kg).  The development of detectable ATAs has not had a significant impact on pharmacokinetics for doses from 10 to 20 mg/kg.  Patients dosed at the 10- , 15-, and 20- mg/kg dose levels have maintained the expected 
target trough levels of drug despi[INVESTIGATOR_33384].  To date, no clear relationship between detection of ATAs and adverse events or infusion reactions has been observed.

result in a significant survival benefit in patients with advanced malignancies ( Hodi et al. 
2010; Kantoff et al. 2010; Chen et al. 2012). 
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
Protocol  MO29518, Version  [ADDRESS_272624] been found to overexpress PD -L1, which acts to suppress anti -tumor 
immunity.  PD -1 is an inhibitory receptor expressed on T cells following T -cell activation, 
which is sustained in states of chronic stimulation such as in chronic infection or cancer 
(Blank et al. 2005; Keir et al. 2008) .  Ligation of PD -L1 with PD -1 inhibits T -cell 
proliferation, cytokine production and cytolytic activity, leading to the functional inactivation or exhaustion of T cells.  B7.1 is a molecule expressed on antigen-
presenting cells and activated T cells.  PD -L1 binding to B7.1 on T cells and antigen-
presenting cells can mediate down- regulation of immune responses, including inhibition 
of T-cell activation and cytokine production ( Butte et al. 2007; Yang et al. 2011). 
Over expression of PD -L1 on tumor cells has been reported to impede anti -tumor 
immunity, resulting in immune evasion ( Blank and Mackensen 2007 ).  Therefore, 
interruption of the PD -L1/PD -[ADDRESS_272625] of care therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  In the PCD4989g Phase Ia dose- escalation and expansion study of 345 evaluable patients 
treated by 21 October 2013 (data cutoff of 21 April 2014) with a median 30.[ADDRESS_272626], v1.1, at an ORR of 
18% (95% CI: 14.1%−22.3%).  Objective responses with Atezolizumab monotherapy 
were observed in a broad range of malignancies including NSCLC, RCC, melanoma, 
bladder cancer, colorectal cancer, head and neck cancer, gastric cancer, breast cancer, and sarcoma.  The median DOR was 77.6 weeks (range: 6.4+ to 97.9+ weeks, where “+ ” denotes a censored value). The majority of these responses have been durable, with 
72.6% (45 of 62) of responses ongoing as of the clinical cutoff date.  
Preliminary results from the Phase Ia Study PCD4989g suggest that PD -L1 expression 
in tumor tissue is likely to be associated with response to Atezolizumab.  A prototype 
immunohistochemistry (IHC) assay was used to measure specific PD -L1 signals in 
tumor cells (TCs) and tumor -filtrating immune cells (ICs).  
The basic approach of the study will  be to examine the efficacy and safety of 
Atezolizumab patients with different advanced solid tumors.  The cancer subtypes were 
chosen based on input from academic experts and relevant published literature.  Two 
types of evidence were considered to be particularly relevant in the choice:  
1. Does evidence exist that the tumor is immunogenic?  Two basic categories of tumor 
antigens are thought to trigger anticancer immune surveillance: abnormal self 
antigens (ASAs), and tumor -specific antigens (TSAs) ( Schreiber et al. 2010) .  ASAs 
are generated in a variety of ways, including induction of embryonal and developmental genes not normally expressed in adult tissues, expression of normal 
proteins with abnormal sugar moieties or expression of self proteins at abnormally 
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
Protocol  MO29518, Version  8 51 high levels.  TSAs result from spontaneous somatic mutations or breaks in germline 
DNA that lead to missense mutations,  frameshift errors or fusion proteins.  Thus, 
advanced solid tumors having potentially high levels of ASAs and/or TSAs were considered to be suitable for inclusion in this study.  A high level of tumor -infiltrating 
lymphocytes was also used as evidence of inherent immunogenicity, as it indicates a tumor microenvironment permissive for leukocyte trafficking and extravasation.  
2. Does evidence exist that the PD -L1 checkpoint may play a role in the development 
of the tumor?  Thus, tumors that have been shown in published reports to express 
PD-L1 in vivo were considered for inclusion in the study.  This evidence was 
considered to be especially relevant if evidence also existed that the level of PD -L1 
expression correlated with cancer grade and/or prognosis, implying a direct role for 
the PD -L1 pathway in tumor immunity.  
 
Based on these considerations, as well as other tumor -specific issues that might suggest 
potential activity for Atezolizumab (see below), the solid cancers described in the 
following sections were chosen for study.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Cervical Cancer  
A key step in an antitumor immune response is the production and recognition of ASAs and TSAs that are recognized by [CONTACT_226842] (non- self).  Breaking 
self-tolerance is not as great of an obstacle for virally -induced cancers because viral 
antigens are inherently non- self, and virally -induced cancers are thus potentially highly 
immunogenic (Schreiber et al. 2010) .   
Human papi[INVESTIGATOR_27509] (HPV) is detected in 99% of cervical tumors, in particular oncogenic subtypes such as HPV 16 and 18 ( Colombo et al. 2012) .  In addition, cervical 
cancer progression is associated with deregulated viral gene expression, which leads to 
(among other things) deficient DNA repair and the accumulation of genetic damage i n 
the infected cell, both of which may increase the levels of TSAs ( Doorbar et al. 2012). 
Evidence in the literature also suggests that PD -L1-mediated immune checkpoints may 
play a role in cervical cancer progression.  PD -L1 was found to be expressed on tumor 
cells in 19% to 29% of patients with cervical cancer ( Karim et al. 2009; Grosso et al. 
2013) .  PD -L1 expression on cervical T cells and dendritic cells, respectively, correlated 
positively with increasing grade ( Yang et al. 2013) and inversely with spontaneous 
regression (Kojima et al. 2013). 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma  
As with cervical cancer, nasopharyngeal  carcinoma is highly associated with viral 
infection, in this case Epstein- Barr virus (EBV), and thus has the potential to be highly 
immunogenic.  In one study, plasma EBV was detectable before treatment in 94 of 99 patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma, but not in 40 healthy controls or 20 cured 
patients (Lin et al. 2004) .  Median plasma EBV levels also correlated with disease stage.  
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
Protocol  MO29518, Version  8 52 Consistent with a role for immune checkpoints in the disease, PD -L1 was expressed on 
tumor cells in 68% to 100% of patients ( Hsu et al. 2010; Yang et al. 2011) .  PD -L1 has 
also been shown to be highly expressed on tumor -infiltrating macrophages in patients 
with nasopharyngeal carcinoma ( Chen et al. 2013) .  Finally, hi gher expression rate of 
PD-1 in intratumoral CD8+ T cells significantly correlated with poorer OS, disease- free 
survival and locoregional recurrence- free survival ( Hsu et al. 2010).  
[IP_ADDRESS]  MSI-H or MMR-Deficient Colorectal Cancer  
In MSI- H colorectal cancer, the accumulation of errors in microsatellites that reside in 
gene exons leads to the generation of a large number of abnormal peptides due to 
frameshift mutations: the so-called "mutator phenotype" ( Bodmer et al. 1994) .  Such an 
array of abnormal peptides represents a pool of potential TSAs that render MSI -H 
tumors inherently more detectable by [CONTACT_167294].  In fact, epi[INVESTIGATOR_226783] (TCGA) estimated that approximately 7 TSAs are generated on average in individual colorectal tumors with appropriate anchor 
residues for MHC loading ( Segal et al. 2008) .   
Consistent with potentially high immunogenicity, MSI -H colorectal cancer is associated 
with high numbers of tumor -infiltrating lymphocytes and a Crohn- like host response 
(Hutchins et al. 2011) .  PD -L1 immune checkpoint regulation has also been directly 
implicated in CRC pathogenesis.  Thus, PD -L1 was expressed on tumor cells in 53% of 
patients with colon adenocarcinoma ( Dong et al. 2002) .  A case report has been 
published describing a patient with PD -L1-positive MSI -H colorectal cancer who 
exhibited a long- term response with the anti -PD-1 antibody BMS -936558 (Lipson et al. 
2013).   Finally, the anti -PD-L1 antibody Atezolizumab demonstrated preliminary activity 
against colorectal cancer in Study PCD4989g as a single agent and in Study GP28328 in combination with bevacizumab ± FOLFOX ( Secti on 1.2.4 ). 
[IP_ADDRESS]  BRCA 1/2 Mutated Cancers 
The BRCA 1/[ADDRESS_272627], double-
strand break repair (DSBR) ( O'Donovan and Livingston 2010 ).  While not as mutagenic 
as mismatch -repair mutants (see previous section), DSBR mutants do exhibit some 
incre ase in mutator activity, as well as a dramatic rise in genomic instability.  This implies 
that BRCA 1/[ADDRESS_272628] high frequencies of induced TSAs ( Schreiber et al. 
2010) .  Consistent with this, it has been estimated that breast cancers accumulate on 
average 10 novel and unique TSAs ( Segal et al. 2008) .  Furthermore, extensive tumor 
infiltration by [CONTACT_226843]8+ T cells was strongly associated with patient survival and 
response to therapy ( Salgado et al. 2014) .  Thus, growth of these tumors may require a 
by[CONTACT_226844].  
Evidence in the literature also suggests that PD -L1-mediated immune checkpoints may 
play a role in cancers commonly associated with BRCA 1/2 mutations.  In one case 
series study ( Ghebeh et al. 2006) , PD-L1 was expressed in [ADDRESS_272629] cancer 
patients in both epi[INVESTIGATOR_226784] -infiltrating lymphocytes.  Intra- tumor 
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
Protocol  MO29518, Version  8 53 expression of PD -L1 was significantly associated with histologic grade, while expression 
of PD-L1 in tumor -infiltrating lymphocytes was associated with large tumor size and 
histologic grade.  In another case series study, PD -L1 was expressed in 152 (23.4%) of 
[ADDRESS_272630] cancer specimens; PD -L1 expression was associated with a significantly 
worse  OS (Muenst et al. 2014) .    
In patients with ovarian cancer, higher expression of PD -L1 on tumor cells correlated 
with a significantly poorer prognosis than lower expression, while a significant inverse 
correlation was observed between PD -L1 expression and the intraepi[INVESTIGATOR_79861]8+ T 
lymphocyte count ( Hamanishi et al.  2007) .  Ovarian cancer -infiltrating dendritic cells 
progressively expressed increased levels of PD -L1 over time.  Accumulation of PD -L1 in 
the tumor was associated with suppression of T cell activity and decreased infiltrating T cells in advancing tumors (Krempski et al. 2011) .  Finally, in a Phase I dose- escalation 
study of 207 patients treated with the anti -PD-L1 antibody BMS -936559,  a response rate 
of 6% was observed in patients with ovarian cancer ( Brahmer et al. 2012) .  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Soft Tissue, Visceral and Bone Sarcomas  
Adult soft tissue sarcoma (STS) and bone and joint sarcoma (BS) constitute a rare group of heterogeneous mesenchymal cancers originating from connective tissue.  There are 
multiple histological subtypes of STS and BS.  
Soft-tissue sarcoma comprises a generally aggressive set of diseases characterized by 
[CONTACT_226845], liposarcoma and leiomyosarcoma.  Genomic profiling indicates that many soft tissue sarcomas contain translocations, mutations, amplifications or other more complex and chaotic karyotypes 
(Maki 2001; Linch et al. 2014) .  Consequently, this broad class of tumors may be rich 
sources of TSAs, implying a by[CONTACT_226846].   Moreover, dendritic cells have been shown to induce an effective antitumor 
immune response in both animal models and human sarcoma trials, suggesting that 
boosting immune responses may have therapeutic value in this setting ( Indelicato and 
Finkelstein 2012). 
Radiation induced sarcomas (RIS) are well -characterized and constitute about 3% of all 
sarcomas.  They are more aggressive than other sarcomas.  One of the most significant 
effects of radiation therapy on normal tissues is mutagenesis and genomic instability which is the basis for radiation- induced malignancies.  A high frequency of MYC 
amplifications has been described in radiation -induced  angiosarcomas, but not in 
primary angiosarcomas and other somatic mutations have been described.  Many tumors that respond to PD -1/PD -L1 inhibitors are those with a high mutation load or that 
are commonly associated with mutations.  
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
Protocol  MO29518, Version  [ADDRESS_272631] common types of bone sarcoma are osteosarcoma and chondrosarcoma. 
PD-L1 expression in osteosarcoma has been described as 36% in 161 patients with 
osteosarcoma ( Raj et al. 2014).  
Evide nce that PD -L1 specifically plays a role in inhibiting immune surveillance in soft 
tissue sarcoma comes from the observation that the protein was expressed on tumor cells in 58% of patients with the disease ( Kim et al. 2013) .  Moreover, PD -L1 expression 
was significantly associated with higher clinical stage, presence of distant metastasis, 
higher histological grade, poor differentiation of tumor and tumor necrosis, suggesting 
the protein is playing an active role in inducing immune checkpoints ( Kim et al. 2013) .  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Mesothelioma  
Chronic exposure to asbestos, a Group I carcinogen, induces genetic alterations in lung epi[INVESTIGATOR_226785]: direct DNA damage, and mutagenic 
asbestos -driven escape from apoptosis ( Otsuki et al. 2007) .  The resulting genetic 
alterations are thought to drive the development of malignant mesothelioma.  The same 
process might be expected to result in an increased rate of TSA production, as well, making mesothelioma a potentially good target for immunotherapeutic approaches.  
Many of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_226786].  There are, however, several important site- specific differences in the demographic features, genetics, and distribution 
of histological subtypes between mesotheliomas arising in the pleural and peritoneal cavities that suggest fundamental biological disparities between tumors at these sites (Husain et al. 2013).  Due to differences in biology and prognosis, two different cohorts 
have been implemented in this study: pleural mesothelioma and peritoneal 
mesothelioma.  
Evidence that mesothelioma tumors are indeed immunogenic comes from studies demonstrating high levels of immune cell infiltration in mesothelioma tumors ( Gregoire 
2010) .  However, the relative levels of lymphocyte subtypes, as well as the cytokine 
levels, indicate that the immune infiltrate is in a relatively tolerogenic state ( Hegmans et 
al. 2006; Gregoire 2010 ), i.e., that immune checkpoints may be required for 
tumorigenesis.  PD -L1 may play a role in forming this tolerogenic state, as the protein 
has been found to be highly expressed on mesothelioma tumor cells and within the 
tumor stroma ( Currie et al. 2009). 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Cholangiocarcinoma/Cancer of the Biliary Tract  
Long established risk factors for cholangiocarcinoma include hepatobiliary flukes, primary sclerosing cholangitis, biliary tract cysts, hepatolithiasis and toxins ( Bridgewater 
et al. 2014) .  All of these etiologic  factors are thought to lead to a chronic state of biliary 
inflammation and increased cellular turnover ( Bridgewater et al. 2014) .  The chronic 
inflammation might be expected to down- regulate immune responses via immune 
checkpoint mechanisms, which in turn might help to promote carcinogenesis.   
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
Protocol  MO29518, Version  [ADDRESS_272632] been shown to induce PD -L1 protein expression following 
administration of interferon- gamma, which is known to be up- regulated in many tumor 
microenvironments (Gong et al. 2009) .  Expression of PD -L1 was also up- regulated in 
cholangiocarcinoma tissues compared with adjacent tissues ( Ye et al. 2009) .  Tumor -
related PD -L1 expression was significantly correlated with both tumor differentiation and 
stage and was inversely correlated with CD8+ tumor -infiltrating lymphocytes.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Thyroid Cancer  
There are 4 types of thyroid cancers – papi[INVESTIGATOR_1396], follicular, medullar and anaplastic. 
Papi[INVESTIGATOR_226787].  
Most patients with differentiated thyroid cancer will evolve favorably with current therapy, 
which mostly includes surgery and radio- iodine treatment; however, 10– 30% will p resent 
recurrent disease and may metastasize.  Medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) usually 
presents low chemosensitivity and radiosensitivity and does not concentrate iodine.  
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_272633] aggressive human tumors, is characterized by [CONTACT_226847] ( Smallridge et al. 2009) . 
DNA copy number changes were found in 11 out of the 13 patients with anaplastic thyroid cancer; gains were noted in 10 out of the 13, deletions in 3 out of the 13, both gains and deletions in two, and chromosome deletion in one ( Hemmer et al. 1999) .  This 
high degree of genetic heterogeneity might be expected to associate with high numbers 
of TSAs , but the highly aggressive course indicates that the immune system is 
nonetheless unable to check the uncontrolled growth.   
The inability of the immune system to slow anaplastic thyroid cancer might be 
attributable, at least in part, to the PD -L1/PD -[ADDRESS_272634], in a study of 407 thyroid nodule tissue samples, including 293 differentiated thyroid carcinoma samples, malignant tissues displayed more intense PD -
L1 staining levels than benign tissues (both p<0.0001) ( Cunha et al. 2013) .  Second, 
elevated levels of PD -L1 protein were associated with the presence of CD4+ and CD8+, 
lymphocytes (p<0.05); tumor -associated macrophages (P<0.0001); and the presence of 
myeloid -derived suppressor cells (P=0.[ZIP_CODE]) ( Cunha et al. 2013) .  Finally, Stage II –IV 
thyroid cancer patients presented with higher PD -L1 mRNA levels than stage I cases 
(p=0.[ZIP_CODE]) (Cunha et al. 2013). 
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_272635] been reported and evidenced by a mixture of immune cells frequently found within, inside, or even surrounding primary thyroid tumors ( Ward et al. 2014).  In papi[INVESTIGATOR_6686], 
PD-L1 expression correlates with a greater risk of recurrence, poorer prognosis and

of pembrolizumab in a cohort of [ADDRESS_272636] therapy, reported 2 partial responses and a stable disease rate of 54.5%  (Mehnert et al, 2016). 
[IP_ADDRESS].3  Medullary thyroid cancer and mixed medullary and follicular or 
papi[INVESTIGATOR_226788] (MTC), arising from parafol licular, calcitonin -producing C 
cells, represents an aggressive, usually slow -growing tumor occurring in both sporadic 
and familial forms.  Sporadic MTC harbors RET gene somatic mutations in up to 50% of 
cases, and RAS  family gene mutations occur in about 10%.  
The immune system has been shown to play a role in MTC as evidenced by [CONTACT_226848]3+ lymphocytes in peripheral blood of patients with MTC, which correlated with prognosis ( Ward et al, 2014).  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Gastric Adenocarcinoma/Adenocarcinoma of the Gastro -
Esophageal Junction 
Infection with Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori), a type of bacterium found in the stomach of about two- thirds of the world’s population, is a major cause of gastric cancer.  A 2001 
combined analysis of 12 case- control studies estimated that the risk of non- cardia 
gastric cancer (cancer in all areas of the stomach, except for the top portion near the esophagus) was nearly six times higher for H. pylori -infected people than for uninfected 
people (Helicobacter and Cancer Collaborative 2001 ).  Similarly, in prospective cohort 
studies, H. pylori -infected individuals had a nearly eight -fold increased risk for non- cardia 
gastric cancer ( Kamangar et al. 2006) .  A general atrophy of the stomach lining caused 
by H. pylori is thought to be the root cause of carcinogenesis in gastric cancer, although more direct interactions mediated by [CONTACT_226849] ( Atherton 
2006). 
As with other bacterial infections, H. pylori induces a robust immune reaction in the host 
(Atherton 2006; Kusters et al. 2006) .  Unlike other bacterial infections, however, the 
immune response is primarily cellular, rather than humoral.  Moreover, the cell -mediated 
immune reactions mounted by [CONTACT_226850], due to H. pylori -induced products that interfere with local immune responses.  Thus, gastric 
cancer develops in the presence of an induced cell -mediated immune response, but one 
which immune subtypes and cytokine levels indicate to be in a tolerogenic state.  It is reasonable to hypothesize that the PD -L1/PD -[ADDRESS_272637] indicated a role for PD -L1 in 
gastri c carcinogenesis.  In case studies, PD-L1 was expressed on tumor cells in 42% to 
65% of patients with gastric cancer ( Wu et al. 2006; Geng et al. 2014; Wei et al. 2014) .  
PD-L1 immunodetection was significantly correlated to tumor size, invasion, lymph node 
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
Protocol  MO29518, Version  8 57 metastasis and survival time of patients.  PD -L1 immunolabeling was si gnificantly 
enhanced (P<0.01) when the tumor infiltrated into the deep muscular layers, with lymph 
node metastasis or survival time of less than 2 years ( Wu et al. 2006; Geng et al. 2014) .  
High expression of PD -L1 was associated with poor prognosis ( Geng et al. 2014) .  
Finally, the anti -PD-L1 antibody Atezolizumab demonstrated preliminary activity against 
gastric cancer in Study PCD4989g. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Other Solid Tumors  
This cohort has been closed to recruitment from P rotocol Version 4 onwards.  
Immune checkpoints and their involvement in tumor surveillance are highly complex, and 
many details of their regulation remain to be determined.  Thus, other cancers than the ones included in the previous 9 cohorts are good targets for Atezolizumab, but might not  
be predicted to be so based on our current knowledge.  In an effort to potentially capture 
other targetable cancers, the cohort enrolled patients with advanced solid tumors not 
included in the other cohorts.  Any positive signals in Cohort  10 may be followed up in 
future clinical studies.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Malignant Germ Cell Tumors  
Malignant germ cell tumors form a heterogeneous entity that is described by [CONTACT_226851]. The tumor s derive from embryonal cells and are located in the majority of 
cases in gonads (testis and ovary), but also in head and neck and mediastinum. 
Gonocytes have almost completely demethylated DNA, which facilitates the accumulation of mutations during cell replication and the development of intratubular 
germ  cell neoplasia ( Hanna et al. NEJM 2014). Frankhauser et al. have published PD -L1 
expression in testicular germ cell tumors. They found 73% of all seminomas and 64% of 
all non- seminomas exhibited PD -L1 expression by [CONTACT_7163] -tissue microarray using a cut -off 
value of 5% (Frankhauser et al. BJC 2015).  
[IP_ADDRESS]  ER+/HER2 - Metastatic Breast Cancer with Known High 
Mutation Load (>100 mutations) by [CONTACT_226852], most of the patients with metastatic ER+/HER2 - breast cancer will die after 4 years. One of the challenges is to identify new 
treatment for patients with ER+/HER2- mBC.  
Whole exome sequencing of metastatic breast cancers has revealed that a subset of 
ER+/Her2 - mBC present with high mutational load ( Stephens et al. Nature 2012, M. 
Disis, ASCO 2015 ). This subset of patients might be more likely to benefit from 
immunotherapy due to increased number of mutations and neoantigens. Haricharan et al. 
demonstrated that ER+, but not ER -, tumors with a high somatic mutational load are 
associated with poor overall survival (HR = 2.02). These high mutation load tumors are enriched for coincident mutations in both DNA damage repair and ER signature [CONTACT_11102] (Haricharan et al. Breast Cancer Res Treat, 2014).

Epi[INVESTIGATOR_226789] a variety of subtypes, well described 
in the World Health Organization ( WHO ) classification and must be differentiated from a 
number of nonepi[INVESTIGATOR_226790], including (but not limited to) neuroendocrine tumors  (NETs) , germ cell tumors and lymphomas. In general, thymomas are indolent 
tumors with a tendency toward local recurrence rather than metastasis.  Thymic carcinomas, however, are typi[INVESTIGATOR_226791], with a higher risk of relapse and a poorer 
prognosis.  
Thymic carcinoma is often associated with an overexpression of growth factor receptors 
like epi[INVESTIGATOR_226792] (EGFR), stem cell factor receptor (SCFR) and 
Insulin -like growth- factor -1 receptor (IGF -1R) and have been found to frequently harbor 
mutations in epi[INVESTIGATOR_226793].  
In a sample of 38 thymic carcinoma patients, 70% stained positive for PD -L1 and in a 
sample of 101 thymoma s, 23 % stained positive for PD -L1 (Katsuyo et  al. 2015).  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Gastroenteropancreatic (GEP) and Lung Neuroendocrine 
Tumors  (NET s) 
Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are generally classified based on their anatomic site of 
origin.  NETs can arise in many different areas of the body, and are most often located in the intestine, pancreas or the lungs.  Due to the different etiology and biology, two different cohorts are implemented in this study: neuroendocrine gastroenteropancreatic 
tumors and neuroendocrine tumors of the lung (excluding small cell lung cancer , SCLC ). 
The WHO classification scheme places neuroendocrine tumors into three main categories, which emphasize the tumor grade rather than the anatomical origin: well -
differentiat ed NETs (low grade), neuroendocrine carcinomas with low -grade malignant 
behavior and poorly differentiated (high grade) and neuroendocrine carcinomas, which 
are the large cell neuroendocrine and small cell carcinomas.  
Neuroendocrine gastroenteropancreatic tumors (GEP -NETs) share a common 
phenotype with immunoreactivity for the so- called ‘pan- neuroendocrine’ markers 
including chromogranin A and synaptophysin.  Neuron- specific enolase (NSE) and CD56 
are often positive in GEP -NETs, but are not specific for this tumor entity. Pulmonary 
neuroendocrine cells (PNECs) express serotonin and NSE and also gastrin- releasing 
peptide (GRP) ( Öberg et al. 2012).  
In a cohort of 32 patients with metastatic GEP -NET, PD -L1 expression was reported in 
21.9% of the patients ( Kim et al. 2016).  
[IP_ADDRESS]  HPV Induced Squamous Cell Carcinomas

Protocol  MO29518, Version  8 59 and 13– 56% oropharyngeal cancers are attributable to HPV, primarily HPV -16 typi[INVESTIGATOR_226794] -18 (De Vuyst et al, 2009).  
[IP_ADDRESS].1  Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC)  
During the past decade, infection with HPVs, in particular HPV16 has emerged as a risk 
factor for HNSCCs, specifically HNSCCs arising in the oropharynx (tonsil, base of tongue, and soft palate). Currently, up to 70% of oropharyngeal cancers in the US are 
HPV-mediated oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas. HPV -16 is detected in over 90% 
of HPV -induced HNSCC and data suggests that HPV -[ADDRESS_272638] a poorer outcome compared with 
other HPV types ( Nichols et al, 2013).  
Recently several studies of PD -1–pathway inhibitors have reported overall response 
rates in the 20% range in relapsed HNSCC (Seiwert et al, 2015; Fury et al. 2014). 
Responses were observed in both HPV positive and HPV negative patients,  
[IP_ADDRESS].2  Penile Cancer  
Penile carcinoma is mostly a squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) with several histological subtypes. In this study only HPV positive squamous cell penile carcinoma will be included. The current treatment of HPV -positive penile SCC is identical to other penile 
SCCs.  
HPV DNA has been detected in approximately 40% to 50% of invasive penile cancer cases and in up to 90% of high- grade squamous intraepi[INVESTIGATOR_12184].  The high -risk 
oncogenic subtypes 16 and 18 were detected in over 60% of HPV -positive specimens.  
[IP_ADDRESS].3  Vaginal and Vulvar Cancers 
SCC accounts for approximately 85% of vaginal cancer cases and about 90% of vulvar carcinomas.  In this study only HPV positive squamous cell carcinoma of the vagina and the vulva will be included. Both HPV 16 and 18 are commonly detected in HPV -induced 
vaginal or vulvar cancers. The treatment of HPV positive or negative SCC of the vagina 
and vulva are identical.

(Serup- Hansen et al, 2014).  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Known MSI High or MMR Deficient Tumors (excluding CRC and 
gastric cancers)  
Microsatellite instability (MSI) is a hypermutable phenotype caused by [CONTACT_226853] a wide range of human solid tumors.  Its frequency is 
highly variable across tumor types and has not been evaluated for all tumor types.  
Frequencies assessed include: uterine 14.1%, small bowel 8.6%, prostate 6.2%, cancer 
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
Protocol  MO29518, Version  8 60 of unknown primary  origin 2.7%, hepatobiliary 2.3%, neuroendocrine 0.2%, pancreas 
0.2%, NSCLC 0.2% and breast 0.1% ( Hall et al, 2016).  
MSI has been linked to a number of phenotypic characteristics and clinicopathological 
features of tumors and its predictive relevance has been primarily studied in colorectal 
cancer.  Recent data are suggestive of more pronounced efficacy of checkpoint 
inhibitors in patients with colorectal or gastric cancer whose tumors are MSI-high.  
MSI-H CRC is known to have an exceptionally high mutation burden.  There is an 
increased presence of tumor -specific neoantigens in hypermutated tumors which is 
associated with an increased quantity of tumor -infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and 
overexpression of immune checkpoint receptors and ligands such as PD -1 and PD -L1 
(Overman et al. 2016). 
Overall the MSI status appears predictive of anti -PD-1/L1 therapy efficacy independently 
of tumor histology ( Le et al., 2015).  
1.3.[ADDRESS_272640] received previous treatment including surgery, radiation therapy and/or  systemic cyto toxic chemotherapy for the 
treatment of their solid tumor(s).  Moreover, it is likely that all standard therapeutic options for their advancing, treatment -refractory disease will have been exhausted, 
necessitating enrolment into a clinical trial, and that their overall prognosis is consequently bleak.   
Immunotherapy with Atezolizumab could provide substantial benefit to the advanced 
solid tumor patients enrolling in this study.  In the ongoing Study PCD4989g, 
Atezolizumab has exhibited efficacy in a variety of solid tumors.  For instance, in 
advanced NSCLC patients with IC ≥  5%, th e confirmed ORR was 26.5% (95% CI: 14.3%, 
43.6%) and the 24- week PFS rate was 36.4% (95% CI: 19.95%, 52.74%).  The DOR 
ranged from 12.3+ to 85.9+ weeks.  In advanced NSCLC patients with IC < 5%, the confirmed ORR was 15.9% (95% CI: 7.2%, 29.0%) and the 24- week PFS rate was 41.1% 
(95% CI: 26.18%, 56.07%).  The DOR ranged from 25.4+ to 70.6+ weeks.   
Significant efficacy was also observed in Study  PCD4989g in patients with advanced 
urothelial cancer (IHC 2/3, O
RR = 52% [95% CI: 34%, 69%]; IHC 0/1, ORR  =  4% [95% 
CI: 6%, 28%]) and advanced RCC (IHC 1/2/3, ORR  = 20% [95% CI: 9%, 37%]; IHC 0, 
ORR = 10% [95% CI: 2%, 30%]) ( Section [IP_ADDRESS]).  Thus, consistent with other s
tudies in 
the literature ( Brahmer et al. 2012) , the ant i-PD-L1 antibody Atezoli
zumab may act as a 
general anticancer immunotherapy that works across multiple solid tumor types.  
Nonetheless, in order to maximize potential patient benefit, s
ubstantial effort has been 
made to choose patients for enrolment who are most likely to benefit from Atezolizumab 
therapy.  To do so, academic experts were queried and relevant published literature was 
reviewed to identify solid tumors that: 1) were likely to have high immunogenicity and, 
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
Protocol  MO29518, Version  8 61 thus, to respond to therapi[INVESTIGATOR_226795]; and 2) had published 
evidence indicating a direct role of PD -L1 expression on clinical outcomes, including 
prognosis and treatment outcomes.  Further detail on the reasons for choosing the included tumors in this study are presented in the previous section ( Section  1.3.1 ).  
Although Atezolizumab has been generally well tolerated (see Section 1.2.3 ), adver se 
events with potentially immune- mediated causes, including rash, hypothyroidism, 
hepatitis/transaminitis, colitis, and myasthenia gravis have been observed in 
Study  PCD4989g.  To date, these events have been monitorable and treatable (see 
Section 5.1.4  and the Atezolizumab Investigator’s Brochure for more information on 
managing adverse events associated with Atezolizumab therapy).  
In summary, then, treatment with Atezolizumab offers the potential for clinical benefit in 
many advanced solid tumors.  Because most Atezolizumab- related toxicities observed to 
date have been mild, transient, and do not overlap with those of chemotherapy, patients 
who do not respond to study treatment are considered likely to be able to subsequently 
receive further  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  Patients will be fully informed of the risk of continuing study 
treatment in spi[INVESTIGATOR_199987], and investigators should make a careful assessment of the potential benefit of doing so, considering radiographic data 
and the clinical status of the patient.

are described in Section 4.1.[ADDRESS_272646] day of each cycle.  One cycle of therapy will be defined as 21 days (±  3 days).   
Patients treated with Atezolizumab who have no post -baseline tumor assessment (per 
protocol mandated timelines), and enrolled patients who do not receive any dose of 
Atezolizumab will be replaced.  
Atezolizumab treatment may be continued as long as patients are experiencing clinical 
benefit, as assessed by [CONTACT_2413], in the absence of unacceptable toxici ty or 
symptomatic deterioration attributed to disease progression after an integrated 
assessment of radiographic data, biopsy results (if available) and clinical status . 
Patients will be permitted to continue Atezolizumab treatment after RECIST v1.1 criteria (or disease- specific criteria for patients with prostate cancer [ Appendix 6] and malignant 
pleural mesothelioma [ Appendix 7]) for progressive disease are met if they meet all of 
the following criteria:  
• Evidence of clinical benefit as assessed by [CONTACT_737]  
• Absence of symptoms and signs (including worsening of laboratory values, e.g., 
new or worsening hypercalcemia) indicating unequivocal progression of disease  
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
Protocol  MO29518, Version  8 66 • No decline in ECOG performance status that can be attributed to disease 
progression 
• Absence of tumor progression at critical anatomical sites (e.g., leptomeningeal 
disease) that cannot be managed by [CONTACT_990] -allowed medical interventions  
 
Patients treated with Atezolizumab in whom radiographic disease progression is 
confirmed at a subsequent tumor assessment may be considered for continued study treatment at the discretion of the Investigator if they continue to meet the above criteria. 
If an individual patient continues to experience clinical benefit beyond 2 years of radiologic progressive disease, it lies within the discretion of each investigator to continue study treatment based on a positive risk benefit assessment by [CONTACT_093].  
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate Investigator -determined non-
progression rate (NPR) at [ADDRESS_272647], v1.1 (except for prostate cancer and malignant pleural  mesothelioma) and disease- specific criteria for 
patients with prostate cancer (see Appendix 6) and malignant pleural mesothelioma (see Appendix 7).  Secondary efficacy variables (including ORR, BOR, CBR, DOR, TTP and PFS) will be recorded using RECIST, v1.1, (except for prostate cancer and malignant pleural mesothelioma) and disease -specific criteria for patients with prostate cancer (see 
Appendix  6) and malignant pleural mesothelioma (see Appendix 7), and modified 
RECIST (see Appendix 3).  
Safety will be monitored by [CONTACT_19693], SAEs, AEs of special interest (AESIs), 
laboratory findings and electrocardiogram.  The National Cancer Institute Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, Version 4.0 (NCI CTCAE, v4.0) will be used to 
quantify the intensity  of AEs occurring during treatment.  Incidence, type and severity of 
AEs, SAEs, incidence of AEs and SAEs leading to Atezolizumab interruption or 
discontinuation and cause of death will be reported.  In addition, to characterize the 
immunogenic potential  and PK of Atezolizumab, blood samples will be taken at various 
time points before and after study treatment administration (see Appendix 2 for a detailed description of the assessments). 
This study will also have an exploratory analysis examining biomarkers.  These analyses 
will be conducted on archival tissue specimens (required for patient inclusion), as well as 
prospectively -collected plasma/blood samples and freshly obtained tumor specimens.  
Collected samples will be analyzed at a central laboratory f or PD -L1 expression, as well 
as other potential markers, to assess relationships between biomarker expression and 
patient outcomes including, but not limited to, response and disease progression.  
All patients will be monitored for survival for a minimum period of [ADDRESS_272648].  Survival follow -up information will be collected via clinic visits, telephone

Protocol  MO29518, Version  8 67 calls and/or review of patient medical records approximately every 3 months from study 
treatment discontinuation until patient death, loss to follow -up, withdrawal of consent or 
until the study is terminated by [CONTACT_1034].  Patients who discontinue study treatment for reasons other than disease progression (e.g., toxicity) should continue to undergo 
scheduled tumor assessments approximately every [ADDRESS_272649].  
Enrollment in this study will be based on Simon's optimal two- stage design ( Simon 1989) .  
Accordingly, [ADDRESS_272650] stage.  
If 3 or more of these patients exhibit non- progressive disease at the end of Stage I, then 
an additional 13 fully -evaluable patients will be enrolled in Stage II.  Thus , approximately 
725 patients are expected to participate in the study.   However, if positive efficacy 
signals are observed in any of the other cohorts that include different tumor types or in a specific subgroup of patients within other cohorts (e.g. biomarker positive subgroup) , the 
Sponsor in discussion with the Steering Committee may decide to extend the enrolment 
of the individual tumor type or subgroup of patients based on methodology explained in 
the Determination of Sample Size ( Section 6.1).  
Please refer to the Schedule of Assessments ( Appendix 1) for more detail on the timing 
and nature of assessments to be carried out in this study.  
3.[ADDRESS_272651].  
Recruitment/enrollment in any of the cohorts may present some challenges. Therefore, a permanent stop rule may be applied if the recruitment rate is too low after any of the 
individual cohorts have been completely enrolled, which could result in stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_226797] (Section 4.6.3).  This decision will be made 
by [CONTACT_226856]. After a cohort has been 
opened for at least 4 months, it may be closed early if the recruitment is less than 2 patients per month on average from the opening of the cohort.  The overall end of study 
will occur when the end of cohort  has occurred for all of the individual cohorts, as 
described above.  
3.3 RATIONALE FOR STUDY DESIGN 
3.3.1  Rationale for Atezolizumab Dose and Schedule  
The fixed dose of 1200 mg (equivalent to an average body weight−based dose of 15 mg/kg) was selected on the basis of both nonclinical studies and available clinical 
data from Study PCD4989g as described below.  
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
Protocol  MO29518, Version  8 68 The target exposure for Atezolizumab was projected on the basis of nonclinical tissue 
distribution data in tumor -bearing mice, target -receptor occupancy in the tumor, the 
observed Atezolizumab i nterim pharmacokinetics in humans, and other factors.  The 
target trough concentration (C trough) was projected to be 6 μg/mL on the basis of several 
assumptions, including: 1) 95% tumor -receptor saturation is needed for efficacy and 2) 
the tumor -interstitial concentration to plasma ratio is 0.30 based on tissue distribution 
data in tumor -bearing mice.  
The Atezolizumab dose is also informed by [CONTACT_226857], safety, PK and immunogenicity data in humans.  Thus, anti -tumor activity has been observed across 
doses from 1 mg/kg to 20 mg/kg.  The MTD of Atezolizumab was not reached and no DLTs have been observed at any tested dose (0.03– 20 mg/kg).  Preliminary PK data 
from Study PCD4989g suggest that Atezolizumab exhibits pharmacokinetics that are both linear and consistent with typi[INVESTIGATOR_226798]1 antibodies at doses ≥  1 mg/kg.  Patients 
dosed at 10- , 15-, and 20- mg/kg have maintained the expected target trough levels 
(6 µg/mL), despi[INVESTIGATOR_226799].  To date, no relationship between the 
development of measurable ATAs and safety or efficacy has been observed.  
Currently available PK and ATA data suggest that the 15- mg/kg Atezolizumab q3w 
regimen (or fixed- dose equivalent) for Phase II and Phase III studies would be sufficient 
to both maintain C
trough 6 μg/mL and further safeguard against both interpatient variability 
and the potential effect of ATAs that might lead to subtherapeutic levels of Atezolizumab at the 10- mg/kg q3w dose level (or fixed- dose equivalent).  From inspection of available 
observed C
trough data, moving further to the 20- mg/kg Atezolizumab q3w regimen does 
not appear to be warranted to maintain targeted C trough levels relative to the proposed 15 -
mg/kg Atezolizumab q3w level.  
Finally, simulations do not suggest any clinically meaningful differences in exposure 
following a fixed dose or a dose adjusted for weight ( Bai et al. 2012) .  On the basis of the 
preceding analysis, a fixed dose of 1200 mg has been selected in this study (equival ent 
to an average body weight- based dose of 15 mg/kg).  
Selection of an every -21-day dosing interval is supported by [CONTACT_226858] a convenient integration with common 
chemotherapeutic regimens.  
All available PK , ATA, safety, and efficacy data for Atezolizumab will continue to be 
evaluated as described above to support the proposed [ADDRESS_272652] multiple cancers.  A Phase I dose- escalation study of 207 
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
Protocol  MO29518, Version  8 69 patients treated with the anti -PD-L1 antibody BMS -936559 reported an ORR of 
approximately 17% in patients with melanoma, 12% in patients with renal cell carcinoma, 
10% in patients with NSCLC and 6% in patients with ovarian cancer (Brahmer et al. 
2012) .  Several durable responses were observed in this study, with partial responses 
and complete responses ongoing at over 18 months.   
Similar ly, in the ongoing Study PCD4989g, Atezolizumab exhibited efficacy in a variety 
of solid tumors, including NSCLC, bladder cancer and RCC ( Section [IP_ADDRESS] ). 
Although the response rate appears to correlate with PD -L1 expression in Phase I study 
PCD4989g, responses per RECIST v1.[ADDRESS_272653] likely to benefit from Atezolizumab therapy.  
To do so, academic experts were queried and relevant published literature was reviewed to identify solid tumors that: 1) were likely to have high immunogenicity and, thus, to respond to therapi[INVESTIGATOR_226795]; and 2) had published evidence 
indicating a direct role of PD -L1 expression on clinical outcomes, including prognosis 
and treatment outcomes.  Further detail on the rationale for choosing the included 
tumors in this study are presented in Section 1.3.1 . 
3.3.3  Rationale for Biomarker Assessments 
The development of advanced cancers is thought to occur by a complex, multi -step 
process involving diverse cell -biological functionalities.  These include sustaining 
proliferative signaling, evading growth suppressors, resisting cell death, enabling replicative immortality, inducing angiogenesis, reprogramming of energy metabolism, 
evading immune destruction and activating invasion and metastasis ( Hanahan and 
Weinberg 2011) .  Therefore, all patients may not be equally likely to benefit from 
treatment with Atezolizumab.  Thus, this study will collect various tumor and blood 
samples at baseline in an effort to identify those patients with advanced solid tumors 
who respond most actively to Atezolizumab.  Furthermore longitudinal sampling of both 
tumor and blood may help identifying changes induced by [CONTACT_226859].  Analysis and comparison of tumor and blood samples might additionally help to (further) develop diagnostic tools and 
techniques.

Protocol  MO29518, Version  8 82 4.3.2  Atezolizumab Dosage, Administration, and Compliance  
The dose of Atezolizumab in this study will be 1200 mg administered by [CONTACT_226862] 3 weeks (21 [± 3] days).  
Administration of Atezolizumab will be performed in a setting with emergency medical 
facilities and staff who are trained to monitor for and respond to medical emergencies.  
Atezolizumab will be delivered in 250 mL 0.9% NaCl IV infusion bags with product contact[CONTACT_226837] (PVC) or polyolefin (PO) and IV infusion lines 
with product contact[CONTACT_226838] (PE) and 0.2 µm in- line filters 
(filter m embrane of polyethersulfone [PES]).  No incompatibilities have been observed 
between Atezolizumab and these infusion materials (bags and infusion lines).  
The initial dose of Atezolizumab will be delivered over 60 (± 15) minutes.  If the first 
infusion is tolerated without infusion- associated adverse events, the second infusion 
may be delivered over 30 (± 10) minutes.  If the 30- minute infusion is well tolerated, all 
subsequent infusions may be delivered over 30 (± 10) minutes.   
For first infusion of study treatment, the patient’s vital signs  must  be determined within 
60 minutes before the infusion; during, and after the infusion if clinically indicated. For 
subsequent infusions, vital signs will be collected within [ADDRESS_272665] dose of Atezolizumab.  Premedication may 
be administered for Cycles ≥ 2 at the discretion of the treating physician.  The 
management of infusion- related reactions will be according to severity as follows:  
• In the event that a patient experiences a mild (NCI CTCAE Grade 1) infusion- related 
event, the infusion rate should be reduced to half the rate being given at the time of 
event onset.  Once the event has resolved, the investigator should wait for 30 
minutes while delivering the infusion at the reduced rate.  If  tolerated, the infusion 
rate may then be increased to the original rate 
• In the event that a patient experiences a moderate infusion- related event (NCI 
CTCAE Grade 2) or flushing, fever, or throat pain, the patient should have his or her infusion immediately interrupted and should receive aggressive symptomatic 
treatment.  The infusion should be restarted only after the symptoms have 
adequately resolved to baseline grade. The infusion rate at restart should be half of 
the infusion rate that was in progress at the time of the onset of the infusion- related 
event  
• For severe or life- threatening infusion- related events (NCI CTCAE Grade 3 or 4), 
the infusion should be stopped immediately, and aggressive resuscitation and 
supportive measures should be initiated.  Patients experiencing severe or life-
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
Protocol  MO29518, Version  8 83 threatening infusion- related events will not receive further infusion and will be further 
managed as clinically indicated until the event resolves  
 
For anaphylaxis precautions, see Appendix 4.  
Guidelines for dosage modification, treatment interruption or discontinuation, and the 
management of specific adverse events are provided in Section 5.1.3  and the 
Atezolizumab Inv estigator’s Brochure.

Patients may also take part in an extension study if the patient is still benefiting from 
treatment (defined as no registered PD) at the time of planned Last Patient Last Visit date. If the extension study is not set -up in time for the patient to roll over by [CONTACT_226863], nor is there a Post -Trial Access Program available, the patient can 
continue treatment in the study until the extension study is opened at the patient’s site. During the interim period between LPLV and a patient rolling over to the extension study, only sa fety data (AE including SAE and AESI) will continue to be collected in the eCRF. 
Other assessments (e.g. tumor assessment) can be performed as per standard of care.
 
 
4.4 CONCOMITANT THERAPY  
4.4.1  Permitted Therapy  
Concomitant therapy includes any prescription medic ations or over -the-counter 
preparations  used by a patient between the 7 days preceding the screening evaluation 
and the treatment discontinuation visit.  
Patients who experience infusion- associated symptoms may be treated symptomatically 
with acetaminophen,  ibuprofen, diphenhydramine and/or famotidine or another H2 
receptor antagonist, as per standard practice (for sites outside the [LOCATION_002], 
equivalent medications may be substituted per local practice).  Serious infusion-associated events manifested by  [CONTACT_27926], hypotension, wheezing, bronchospasm, 
tachycardia, reduced oxygen saturation or respi[INVESTIGATOR_226800] (e.g., supplemental oxygen and β2-
adrenergic agonists).  
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
Protocol  MO29518, Version  8 85 Systemic corticosteroi ds and tumor necrosis factor−α inhibitors may attenuate potential 
beneficial immunologic effects of treatment with Atezolizumab but may be administered 
at the discretion of the treating physician.  If feasible, alternatives to corticosteroids should be considered.  Premedication may be administered for Cycles ≥ 2 at the 
discretion of the treating physician after consultation with the Medical Monitor.  The use 
of inhaled corticosteroids for COPD and mineralocorticoids (e.g., fludrocortisone) and low-dose corticosteroids for patients with orthostatic hypotension or adrenocortical 
insufficiency is allowed.  Megestrol administered as an appetite stimulant is acceptable 
while the patient is enrolled in the study.  
Colony -stimulating factors, such as granulocyte colony -stimulating factor and 
erythropoietin, should only be used according to the ASCO and ASCO/ASH guidelines, respectively (Smith et al. 2006; Rizzo et al. 2010) .  Influenza vaccination should be given 
during influenza season only (approximately October to March).  Patients must not 
receive live, attenuated influenza vaccine (e.g., FluMist®) within [ADDRESS_272668] dose of 
Atezolizumab,  but may receive inactivated vaccine.  
Patients who use hormonal therapy with gonadotropin- releasing hormone agonists or 
antagonists for prostate cancer, oral contraceptives, hormone- replacement therapy, 
prophylactic or therapeutic anticoagulation therapy (such as low molecular weight heparin or warfarin at a stable dose level), or other allowed maintenance therapy (see Section 4.1.2 ) should continue their use.  
Females of reproductive potential should use a highly effective means of contraception.  
All concomitant medications should be reported to the investigator and recorded on the 
appropriate eCRF.
 
 
4.4.2  Prohibited Therapy  
Any concomitant therapy intended for the treatment of cancer, whether health authority -
approved or experimental, is prohibited.  This includes but is not limited to the following:  
• Chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, immunotherapy, radiotherapy, investigational 
agents or herbal therapy (except for maintenance therapi[INVESTIGATOR_33944] 4.1.1 , 
and 4.1.2 ) 
– After Cycle 2, certain forms of radiotherapy may be considered for pain palliation if patients are deriving benefit (e.g., treatment of known bone 
metastases). Please contact [CONTACT_226864].  
– Patients experiencing a mixed response requiring local therapy (e.g., surgery, stereotactic radiosurgery, radiotherapy, radiofrequency ablation) for control of 
three or fewer lesions may still be eligible to continue study treatment.  Patients 
who receive local therapy directed at a target lesion will no longer be evaluable 
for radiographic response but will remain evaluable for progression. Such cases 
must be discussed with and approved by [CONTACT_226865] —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
Protocol  MO29518, Version  8 86  
• The concomitant use of herbal therapi[INVESTIGATOR_226801], safety profiles, and potential drug -drug interactions are generally 
unknown.  However, their use for patients on study is allowed at the discretion of the investigator, provided that there are no known interactions with any study treatment.  
As noted above, herbal therapi[INVESTIGATOR_70057]  
• Patients who are receiving a receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand 
inhibitor (denosumab) prior to enrollment must be willing and eligible to receive a 
bisphos phonate instead while on study; denosumab could potentially alter the 
activity and the safety of Atezolizumab 
 
Patients should not receive any live, attenuated vaccine (e.g., FluMist®) at any time 
during the study while the patient is receiving Atezolizumab and for a period of 5 months 
after the discontinuation of Atezolizumab.  
Patients are not allowed to receive immunostimulatory agents, including but not limited to interferon (IFN) -α, IFN -γ, or IL -2, during the entire study.  These agents, in 
combination with Atezolizumab, could potentially increase the risk for autoimmune 
conditions.  
Patients should also not receive immunosuppressive medications, including but not limited to cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, methotrexate, and thalidomide.  These 
agents could potentially alter the activity and the safety of Atezolizumab.  Systemic 
corticosteroids and anti−TNF -α agents may attenuate potential beneficial immunologic 
effects of treatment with Atezolizumab, but may be administered at the discretion of the treatin g physician. If feasible, alternatives to these agents should be considered.  
In addition, all patients should not receive other immunostimulatory agents for [ADDRESS_272669] be completed and reviewed to confirm that patients meet 
all eligibility criteria before Cycle 1 Day 1.  The investigator will maintain a screening log

screening failure, as applicable.  
4.5.2  Medical History, Disease History and Demographic Data  
Medical history includes clinically significant diseases, surgeries, cancer history (including but not limited to cancer histology, grade, stage, prior cancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_27517], smoking history, asbestos exposure). The following must be reported: 
results of HPV determination on tumor tissue using in situ hybridization (ISH) or a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) -based test (results from existing tests must be 
available at baseline for patient s who are candidates for the HPV induced tumors cohort), 
results of determination of microsatellite instabilit y (MSI)  or MMR deficiency on tumor 
tissue and corresponding normal tissue per institution’s standard practice (results from existing tests must be available at  baseline for patients who are candidates for the MSI -
high or MMR deficient tumor cohorts), results of BRCA mutations (results from existing 
tests must be provided at baseline for patients candidates for the BRCA positive breast 
or ovarian cancer cohort), results of ER and HER2 status and documentation of number 
of mutations detected by [CONTACT_226833] ( results from existing tests  are mandatory at baseline 
for patients who are candidates for the breast cancer with > 100 mutations cohort), 
results of EBV determination on tumor tissue per local institutional practice (nasopharyngeal and gastric cancer cohort s).  Associated syndromes, Helicobacter 
pylori  infection, and relevant mutations ( such as RET/PTC, PTEN, BRAF, RAS, PI3KCA, 
TP53, etc.), reproductive status, and all medications (e.g., prescription drugs, over -the-
counter drugs, herbal or homeopathic remedies, nutritional supplements) used by [CONTACT_25701] [ADDRESS_272671] results or medical history  may be 
collected by  [CONTACT_226866], either for a specific cohort or for specific 
cases. A review of histopathology may be performed by [CONTACT_226867] - this will b e 
performed using tissue/slides collected for biomarkers.  
Demographic data will include age, sex, and self -reported race/ethnicity.  
4.5.3  Physical Examinations  
A complete physical examination should include an evaluation of the head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat  and the cardiovascular, dermatological, musculoskeletal, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], 
gastrointestinal, and neurological systems.  Any abnormality identified at baseline should be recorded on the General Medical History and Baseline Conditions eCRF.  Height and weight should be measured and recorded in the eCRF.  
At subsequent visits (or as clinically indicated), limited, symptom -directed physical 
examinations should be performed.  Changes from baseline abnormalities should be

A CT (with contrast) or MRI scan of the head must be done at screening to evaluate CNS metastas is in all patients.  An MRI scan of the brain is required to confirm or refute 
the diagnosis of CNS metastases at baseline in the event of an equivocal scan (see Section 4.1.2  for CNS -related exclusions).  
Bone scans and CT scans of the neck should also be performed if clinically indicated.  At the investigator’s discretion, other methods of assessment of measurable disease as per 
RECIST v1.1 (except for prostate cancer and malignant pleural mesothelioma) and 
disease- specific criteria for patients with prostate cancer (see Appendix 6) and malignant 
pleural mesothelioma (see Appendix 7) may be used.  
For subsequent tumor assessments, procedures should be performed as indicated in Appendix 1.  The same radiographic procedure used to assess disease sites at screening should be used throughout the study (e.g., the same contrast protocol for CT scans).  All known sites of disease must be documented at screening and reassessed at 
each subsequent tumor evaluation.  Response will be assessed by [CONTACT_26218] v1.1 (except for prostate cancer and malignant pleural mesothelioma) and disease- specific criteria for patients with prostate cancer (see Appendix  6) and malignant 
pleural mesothelioma (see Appendix 7), and modified RECIST criteria (see Appendix 3).  
The same evaluator should perform assessments if possible to ensure internal 
consistency across visits.

may be collected by [CONTACT_226868], either for a 
specific cohort or for specific cases (e.g. to validate responses) . 
4.5.6  Laboratory, Biomarker, and Other Biological Samples  
Local laboratory  assessments will include the following:  
• Hematology (CBC, including RBC count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, WBC count with 
automated differential [neutrophils, eosinophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, basophils, 
and other cells], and platelet count). A manual differential can be done if clinically 
indicated.  
• Serum chemistries (includes BUN, creatinine/creatinine clearance,  sodium, 
potassium, magnesium, chloride, bicarbonate ([if routinely performed on venous 
blood samples]), calcium, phosphorus, glucose, total bilirubin with fractionation into 
direct and indirect (if total bilirubin elevated during the study), ALT, AST, alkaline 
phosphatase, lactate dehydrogenase, total protein and albumin)

4.5.8  Samples for [COMPANY_002] Clinical Repository  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Overview of the [COMPANY_002] Clinical Repository  
The [COMPANY_002] Clinical Repository (RCR) is a centrally administered group of facilities used for the long- term storage of human biologic specimens, including body fluids, solid 
tissues, and derivatives thereof (e.g., DNA, RNA, proteins, peptides).  The collection and analysis of RCR specimens will facilitate the rational design of new pharmaceutical agents and the development of diagnostic tests, which may allow for individualized drug therapy for patients in the future.  
RCR specimens will be used to achieve the following objectives:  
• To further study the association of biomarkers with efficacy, adverse events, or 
disease progression 
• To increase knowledge and understanding of disease biology 
• To study drug response, including drug effects and the processes of drug absorption and disposition 
• To develop biomarker or diagnostic assays and establish the performance 
characteristics of these assays

Protocol  MO29518, Version  8 92 and, if applicable, an appropriate regulatory body.  If a site has not been granted 
approval for RCR sampling, this section of the protocol ( Section 4.5.8) will not be 
applicable at that site.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Sample Collection  
All blood and tissue samples collected in this study and derivatives thereof will be destroyed no later than [ADDRESS_272676] the option, at the time of 
enrolment, to consent to RCR sampling to allow the remainder of these samples and derivatives thereof to be stored and used for exploratory research.  If the patient provides consent for this optional exploratory research, these samples will be sent to 
and stored in the RCR and will be destroyed no later than 15 years after the date of final 
closure of the clinical study database.  
These specimens will be used for research purposes to identify biomarkers that are 
predictive of response to study treatment (in terms of dose, safety, and tolerability) and 
will help to better understand the pathogenesis, course, and outcome of advanced solid tumors.  Specimens for non- inherited biomarker discovery will be single coded like any 
other clinical sample (labeled and tracked using the patient’s study identification number 
(see Section 8.4 and [IP_ADDRESS] ).  Genetic specimens will undergo additional processes to 
maintain confident iality upon receipt by [CONTACT_25736] ( Section [IP_ADDRESS] )   
Tumor tissue, plasma samples and derivatives thereof ar

lected throughout the 
study for purposes of b iomarker assessment ( Section 2.4 and Schedule of Assessments 
[Appendix 1 and 2]).  Residual samples will be collected and stored for research 
purposes, including tumor samples (archival material and freshly obtained biopsies) and 
plasma samples.  Archival tumor tissue blocks from the initial diagnosis will be returned 
to the site.  
The specimens in the RCR will be made available for future biomarker research toward further understanding of study treatment, solid tumors and related diseases, adverse events and toward development of potential associated diagnostic assays.  The implementation and use of the RCR specimens is governed by [CONTACT_226872].
 
For all samples, dates of consent and specimen collection should be recorded on the 
associate d RCR page of the eCRF.  For sampling procedures, storage conditions, and 
shipment instructions, see the Laboratory Manual.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Confidentiality  
The dynamic biomarker specimens will be subject to the confidentiality standards described in Section 8.4.  The genetic biomarker specimens will undergo additional 
processes to ensure confidentiality, as described in the section below.  
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
Protocol  MO29518, Version  8 93 Given the sensitive nature of genetic data, [COMPANY_002] has implemented additional processes 
to ensure patient confidentiality for RCR specimens and associated data.  Upon receipt by [CONTACT_25736], each specimen is "double- coded" by [CONTACT_70144] a new independent number.  Data generated from the use of these 
specimens and all clinical data transferred from the clinical database and considered 
relevant are also labeled with this same independent number.  A "linking key" between the patient identification number and this new independent number is stored in a secure database system.  Access to the linking key is restricted to authorized individuals and is 
monitored by [CONTACT_25738].  Legitimate operational reasons for accessing the linking key are 
documented in a standard operating procedure.  Access to the linking key for any other reason requires written approval from the Pharma Repository Governance Committee and [COMPANY_002]'s Legal Department, as applicable.  
Data generated from RCR specimens must be available for inspection upon request by [CONTACT_25735], and [COMPANY_002] monitors, representatives, and collaborators, as appropriate.  
Patient medical information associated with RCR specimens is confidential and may be disclosed to third parties only as permitted by [CONTACT_25734] (or separate 
authorization for use and disclosure of personal health information) signed by [CONTACT_102], 
unless permitted or required by [CONTACT_2371].  
Data derived from RCR specimen analysis on individual patients  will generally not be 
provided to study Investigators unless a request for research use is granted.  The aggregate results of any research conducted using RCR specimens will be available in accordance with the effective [COMPANY_002] policy on study data publicat ion. 
Any inventions and resulting patents, improvements, and/or know -how originating from 
the use of the RCR data will become and remain the exclusive and unburdened property of [COMPANY_002], except where agreed otherwise.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Consent to Participate in the [COMPANY_002] Clinical Repository  
The Informed Consent Form administered at study enrolment will contain a separate 
section that addresses participation in the RCR.  The Investigator or authorized 
designee will explain to each patient the objectives, methods, and potential hazards of participation in the RCR.  Patients will be told that they are free to refuse to participate and may withdraw their specimens at any time and for any reason during the storage 
period.  A separate, specific signature [CONTACT_22862] a patient's 
agreement to participate in the optional RCR research.  Patients who decline to participate will not provide a separate signature.  
The Investigator should document whether or not the patient has given consent to participate by [CONTACT_26806].  
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
Protocol  MO29518, Version  8 94 In the event of an RCR participant's death or loss of competence, the participant's 
specimens and data will continue to be used as part of the RCR research.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Withdrawal from the [COMPANY_002] Clinical Repository  
Patients who give consent to RCR research have the right to withdraw their specimens 
from the RCR at any time for any reason.  If a patient wishes to withdraw consent to the testing of his or her specimens, the Investigator must inform the Medical Monitor in 
writin g of the patient's wishes through use of the RCR Subject Withdrawal Form and, if 
the trial is ongoing, must enter the date of withdrawal on the RCR Research Sample 
Withdrawal of Informed Consent eCRF.  The patient will be provided with instructions on how to withdraw consent after the trial is closed.  A patient's withdrawal from Study 
MO29518 does not, by [CONTACT_5071], constitute withdrawal of specimens from the RCR.  Likewise, a patient's withdrawal from the RCR does not constitute withdrawal from Study  MO29518. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Monitoring and Oversight  
RCR specimens will be tracked in a manner consistent with Good Clinical Practice by a 
quality -controlled, auditable, and appropriately validated laboratory information 
management system, to ensure compliance with data confidentiality as well as 
adherence to authorized use of specimens as specified in this protocol and in the Informed Consent Form.  [COMPANY_002] monitors and auditors will have direct access to 
appropriate parts of records relating to patient participation in the RCR for the purposes 
of verifying the data provided to [COMPANY_002].  The site will permit monitoring, audits, IRB/EC review, and health authority inspections by [CONTACT_25740].

5. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY  
5.1 SAFETY PLAN  
Atezolizumab (TECENTRIQ®) is approved for the treatment of urothelial carcinoma, 
NSCLC , small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and triple- negative breast cancer (TNBC) . 
Human experience is currently ongoing and the entire safety profile is not known at this time.  The following information is based on results  from nonclinical and clinical studies 
and published data on similar molecules.  
Measures will be taken to ensure the safety of patients participating in this trial, including the use of stringent inclusion and exclusion criteria (see Section 4.1.1  and 4.1.2) and 
close monitoring (as indicated below and in Section 4.5). 
Administration of Atezolizumab will be performed in a setting with emergency medical 
facilities and staff who are trained to monitor for and respond to medical emergencies.  All adverse events and serious adverse events will be recorded during the trial and for up to [ADDRESS_272679] in part, 
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
Protocol  MO29518, Version  [ADDRESS_272680] evidence of potential 
pseudoprogression/tumor immune infiltration.  The potential safety issues anticipated in this trial, as well as measures intended to avoid or minimize such toxicities, are outlined 
in the following sections.  
5.1.1  Risks Associated With Atezolizumab 
The PD -L1/PD -[ADDRESS_272681] is involved in peripheral tolerance; therefore, such therapy 
may increase the risk of immune- mediated adverse events, specifically the induction or 
enhancement of autoimmune conditions.   
Atezolizumab has been associated with risks such as the following:  IRRs and immune-
mediated hepatitis, pneumonitis, colitis, pancreatitis, diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, 
hyperthyroidism, adrenal insufficiency, hypophysitis, Guillain- Barré syndrome, 
myasthenic syndrome or myasthenia gravis, meningoencephalitis, myocarditis, nephritis, 
and myositis.  Immune- mediated reactions may involve any organ system and may lead 
to hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and macrophage activation syndrome.  
Refer to Appendix 8 and Section 6 of the Atezolizumab Investigator's Brochure for a 
detailed description of anticipated safety risks for atezolizumab.  
5.1.2  General Plan to Manage Safety Concerns  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Eligibility Criteria  
Eligibility criteria were selected to guard the safety of patients in this trial.  Results from the nonclinical toxicology studies with Atezolizumab, as well as the nonclinical/clinical 
data from other PD -L1/PD -[ADDRESS_272682] received a 
live-attenuated viral vaccine within 4 weeks of Cycle 1 Day 1 are excluded from the 
study (see Section 4.1.2  for additional details).  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Monitoring 
Safety will be evaluated in this study through the monitoring of all serious and non-serious adverse events defined and graded according to NCI CTCAE, v4.0.  Patients will be assessed for safety (including laboratory values) according to the Schedule of Assessments (Appendix 1).  Laboratory values must be reviewed prior to each infusion.  
General safety assessments will include serial interval histories, physical examinations , 
and specific laboratory studies, including serum chemistries and blood counts (see 
Appendix [ADDRESS_272683] and timing of study assessments).  
During the study, patients will be closely monitored for the development of any signs or 
symptoms of autoimmune conditions and infection. 
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
Protocol  MO29518, Version  [ADDRESS_272684] (see  
Sections 5.2.2  and 5.2.3 ) will be reported in an expedited fashion (see Sect ion 5.4.2).   
Patients will be followed for safety for [ADDRESS_272685] an ongoing study drug−related adverse event upon study completion 
or at discontinuation from the study will be followed until the event has resolved to 
baseline grade, the event is assessed by [CONTACT_226876], new anti -cancer 
treatment is initiated, the patient is lost to follow -up, the patient withdraws consent, or it 
has been determined that study treatment or participation is not the cause of the adverse 
event.  
5.1.3  Atezolizumab Dose Modification 
There will be no dose reduction for Atezolizumab in this study.  Patients may temporarily 
suspend study treatment if they experience adverse events that require a dose to be held.  If Atezolizumab is held because of adverse events for > [ADDRESS_272686] been given, then the patient will be discontinued from 
Atezolizumab treatment and will be followed for safety and efficacy as specified in the Schedule of Assessments (Appendix  1). 
If a patient must be tapered off steroids used to treat adverse events, Atezolizumab may be held for additional time beyond 105 days. The acceptable length of interruption will depend on an agreement between the investigator and the Medical Monitor.   
Dose interruptions for reason(s) other than adverse events, such as surgical procedures, may be allowed with Medical Monitor approval.  The acceptable length of interruption will depend on agreement between the investigator and the Medical Monitor.  
5.1.4  Management of Specific Adverse Events  
 Refer to Appendix 8 and Section 6 of the Atezolizumab Investigator's Brochure for a 
detailed description of anticipated safety risks for atezolizumab. 
5.[ADDRESS_272687], performing 
protocol -specified safety laboratory assessments, measuring protocol -specified vital 
signs, and conducting other protocol -specified tests that are deemed critical to the safety 
evaluation of the study.  
Certain types of events require  immediate reporting to the Sponsor, as outlined in 
Section 5.4. 
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
Protocol  MO29518, Version  [ADDRESS_272688], regardless of causal attribution.  An adverse event can 
therefore be any of the following:  
• Any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, 
whether or not considered related to the medicinal product  
• Any new disease or exacerbation of an existing disease (a worsening in the 
character, frequency, or severity of a known condition), except as described in 
Section [IP_ADDRESS]  
• Recurrence of an intermittent medical condition (e.g., headache) not present at baseline 
• Any deterioration in a laboratory value or other cli nical test (e.g., ECG, X -ray) that is 
associated with symptoms or leads to a change in study treatment or concomitant treatment or discontinuation from study drug 
• Adverse events that are related to a protocol -mandated intervention, including those 
that occur prior to assignment of study treatment (e.g.,  screening invasive 
procedures such as biopsies)  
 
5.2.2  Serious Adverse Events (Immediately Reportable to the 
Sponsor)  
A serious adverse event is any adverse event that meets any of the following criteria:  
• Is fatal  (i.e., the adverse event actually causes or leads to death)  
• Is life threatening (i.e.,  the adverse event, in the view of the investigator, places the 
patient at immediate risk of death)  
This does not include any adverse event that had it occurred in a more severe form or was allowed to continue might have caused death.  
• Requires or prolongs inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] ) 
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (i.e., the adverse event results in substantial disruption of the patient’s ability to conduct normal life 
functions)  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect in a neonate/infant born to a mother exposed to 
study dr ug 
• Is a significant medical event in the investigator's judgment (e.g., may jeopardize the patient or may require medical/surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes 
listed above)  
 
The terms "severe" and "serious" are not  synonymous.  Severity refers to the intensity of 
an adverse event (e.g., rated as mild, moderate, or severe, or according to National 
Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) criteria; 
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
Protocol  MO29518, Version  8 100 see Section 5.3.3 ); the event itself may be of relatively minor medical significance (such 
as severe headache without any further findings).  
Severity and seriousness need to be independently assessed for each adverse event 
recorded on the eCRF.  
Serious adverse events are required to be reported by [CONTACT_13657] (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Section  5.4.2 for 
reporting instructions).  
5.2.[ADDRESS_272689] (Immediately 
Reportable to the Sponsor)  
Non-serious adverse events of special interest are required to be reported by t he 
investigator to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the 
event; see Section 5.4.2  for reporting instructions).  Adverse events of special interest 
for this study include the following: 
• The following are confirmed treatment- emergent autoimmune conditions: 
• Pneumonitis  
• Colitis  
• Endocrinopathies: diabetes mellitus, pancreatitis, adrenal insufficiency or 
hyperthyroidism  
• Hepatitis  
• Transaminitis: Grade ≥ 2 (AST or ALT > 3 × ULN and bilirubin > 2 × ULN ) or  
  AST/ALT > 10 × ULN  
– Systemic lupus erythematosus  
– Neurological: Guillain- Barré syndrome, Myasthenia Gravis, 
Meningoencephalitis  
• Events suggestive of hypersensitivity, cytokine release,SIRS (influenza- like illness, 
systemic inflammatory response syndrome), SIA ( systemic inflammatory activation) or infusion- reaction syndromes"  
• Cases of potential drug- induced liver injury that include an elevated ALT or AST in 
combination with either an elevated bilirubin or clinical jaundice, as defined by [CONTACT_25742]’s law (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] ) 
• Suspected transmission of an infectious agent by [CONTACT_5257], as defined below  
o Any organism, virus, or infectious particle (e.g., prion protein transmitting transmissible spongiform encephalopathy), pathogenic or non- pathogenic, 
is considered an infectious agent.  A transmission of an infectious agent 
may be suspected from clinical symptoms or laboratory findings that 
indicate an infection in a patient exposed to a medicinal product.  This 
term applies only when a contamination of the study drug is suspected."

Protocol  MO29518, Version  8 101  
5.3 MET HODS AND TIMING FOR CAPTURING AND ASSESS ING 
SAFETY PARAMETERS 
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all adverse events (see Section 5.2.1  for 
definition) are recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF and reported to the Sponsor in 
accordance with instructions provided in this section and in Section 5.4-5.6. 
For each adverse event recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, the investigator will make 
an assessment of seriousness (see Section  5.2.2  for seriousness criteria), severity (see 
Section 5.3.3 ), and causality (see Section 5.3.4 ).   
5.3.[ADDRESS_272690].  All adverse events, whether reported by [CONTACT_25743],  will be 
recorded in the patient’s medical record and on the Adverse Event eCRF.  
After informed consent  has been obtained but prior to initiation of study drug , only 
serious adverse events caused by a protocol -mandated intervention (e.g., invasive 
procedures such as biopsies, discontinuation of medications) should be reported (see  Section 5.4.2  for instructions fo r reporting serious adverse events).  
After initiation of study drug , all adverse events will be reported until [ADDRESS_272691].  After this period, the investigator should report any serious adverse events that are believed to be related to prior study drug treatment (see Section 5.6). 
5.3.2  Eliciting Adverse E vent Information 
A consistent methodology of non- directive questioning should be adopted for eliciting 
adverse event information at all patient evaluation timepoints.  Examples of nondirective 
questions include the following:  
"How have you felt since your last clinic visit?"  
"Have you had any new or changed health problems since you were last here?"  
 
5.3.3  A ssessment of Severity of A dverse Events  
The adverse event severity grading scale for the NCI CTCAE (v4.0) will be used for 
assessing adverse event severity.  Table  6 will be used for assessing severity for 
adverse events that are not specifically listed in the NCI CTCAE.

5.3.4  Assessment of Causality of Adverse Events 
Investigators should use their knowledge of the patient, the circumstances surrounding 
the event, and an evaluation of any potential alternative causes to determine whether or not an adverse event is considered to be related to the study drug, indicating "yes" or 
"no" accordingly.  The following guidance should be taken into consideration 
• Temporal relationship of event onset to the initiation of study drug  
• Course of the event, considering especially the effects of dose reduction, 
discontinuation of study drug, or reintroduction of study drug (as applicable)  
• Known association of the event with the study drug or with similar treatments  
• Known association of the event with the disease under study  
• Presence of risk  factors in the patient or use of concomitant medications known to 
increase the occurrence of the event  
• Presence of non- treatment -related factors that are known to be associated with the 
occurrence of the event

Protocol  MO29518, Version  [ADDRESS_272693] medical terminology/concepts when recording adverse events on the Adverse Event eCRF.  Avoid colloquialisms  and abbreviations.  
Only one adverse event term should be recorded in the event field on the Adverse Event eCRF.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Diagnosis versus Signs and Symptoms  
For adverse events other than infusion- related reactions, a diagnosis (if known) should 
be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF rather than individual signs and symptoms (e.g., record only liver failure or hepatitis rather than jaundice, asterixis, and elevated transaminases).  However, if a constellation of signs and/or symptoms cannot be medically characterized as a single diagnosis or syndrome at the time of reporting, each 
individual event should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.  If a diagnosis is subsequently established, all previously reported adverse events based on signs and symptoms should be nullified and replaced by [CONTACT_25746], with a starting date that corresponds to the starting date of the first 
symptom of the eventual diagnosis.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  A dverse Events That A re Secondary to Other Events  
In general, adverse events that are secondary to other events (e.g., cascade events or 
clinical sequelae) should be identified by [CONTACT_5252], with the exception of severe or serious secondary events.  A medically significant secondary adverse event 
that is separated in time from the initiating event should be recorded as an independent 
event on the Adverse Event eCRF.  For example:  
• If vomiting results in mild dehydration with no additional treatment in a healthy adult, only vomiting should be reported on the eCRF.  
• If vomiting results in severe dehydration, both events should be reported separately 
on the eCRF.  
• If a severe gastrointestinal hemorrhage leads to renal failure, both events should be 
reported separately on the eCRF. 
• If dizziness leads to a fall and consequent fracture, all three events should be reported separately on the eCRF. 
• If neutropenia is accompanied by [CONTACT_25747], both events should be reported 
separately on the eCRF.  
 
All adverse events should be recorded separately on the Adverse Event eCRF if it is  
unclear as to whether the events are associated.  
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
Protocol  MO29518, Version  8 104 [IP_ADDRESS]  Persistent or Recurrent A dverse Events  
A persistent adverse event is one that extends continuously, without resolution, between 
patient evaluation timepoints. Such events should only be recorded once on the Adverse 
Event eCRF . The initial severity (intensity or grade) of the event will be recorded at the 
time the event is first reported.  If a persistent adverse event becomes more severe, the most extreme severity should also be recorded on the Adverse Event  eCRF.  If the event 
becomes serious, it should be reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 
24 hours after learning that the event became serious; see Section 5.4.2  for reporting 
instructions).  The Adverse Event eCRF should be updated by [CONTACT_25748] 
"non- serious" to "serious," providing the date that the event became serious, and 
completing all data fields related to serious  adverse events.  
A recurrent adverse event is one that resolves between patient evaluation timepoints and subsequently recurs.  Each recurrence of an adverse event should be recorded as a separate event on the Adverse Event eCRF.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Abnormal Laboratory Values  
Not every laboratory abnormality qualifies as an adverse event.  A laboratory test result 
must be reported as an adverse event if it meets any of the following criteria:  
− Change from baseline and one of the following:  
• Is accompanied by [CONTACT_4659]  
• Results in a change in study treatment (e.g., dosage modification, treatment 
interruption, or treatment discontinuation)  
• Results in a medical intervention (e.g., potassium supplementation for hypokalemia) 
or a change in concomitant therapy  
• Is clinically sign ificant in the investigator’s judgment  
Note:  For oncology trials, certain abnormal values may not qualify as adverse events.  
 It is the investigator’s responsibility to review all laboratory findings.  Medical and 
scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated laboratory 
abnormality should be classified as an adverse event.  
If a clinically significant laboratory abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome 
(e.g., alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin 5 × ULN associated with cholestasis), only the 
diagnosis (i.e.,  cholestasis) should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.  
If a clinically significant laboratory abnormality is not a sign of a disease or syndrome, 
the abnormality itself should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, along with a descriptor indicating if the test result is above or below the normal range (e.g., "elevated potassium," as opposed to "abnormal potassium").  If the laboratory abnormality can be 
characterized by a precise clinical term per standard definitions, the clinical term should 
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
Protocol  MO29518, Version  8 105 be recorded as the adverse event.  For example, an elevated serum potassium level of 
7.0 mEq/L should be recorded as "hyperkalemia."  
Observations of the same clinically significant laboratory abnormality from visit to visit 
should only be recorded once on the Adverse Event eCRF (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] for 
details on recording persistent adverse events).  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Abnormal Vital Sign Values  
Not every vital sign abnormality qualifies as an adverse event.  A vital sign result must 
be reported as an adverse event if it meets any of the following criteria:  
- Change from baseline and one of the following:  
• Is accompanied by [CONTACT_4659]  
• Results in a change in study treatment (e.g., dosage modification, treatment 
interruption, or treatment discontinuation)  
• Results in a medical intervention or a change in concomitant therapy 
• Is clinically significant in the investigator’s judgment  
 
It is the investigator’s responsibility to review all vital sign findings.  Medical and scientific 
judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated vital sign abnormality 
should be classified as an adverse event.  
If a clinically significant vital sign abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome (e.g., high blood pressure), only the diagnosis (i.e.,  hypertension) should be recorded on 
the Adverse Event eCRF.  
Observations of the same clinically significant vital sign abnormality from visit to visit should only be recorded once on the Adverse Event eCRF (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] for 
details on recording persistent adverse events).  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Abnormal Liver Function Tests  
The finding of an elevated ALT or AST (> 3 x baseline value) in combination with either 
an elevated total bilirubin (> 2xULN) or clinical jaundice in the absence of cholestasis or 
other causes of hyperbilirubinemia is considered to be an indicator of severe liver injury (as defined by [CONTACT_25742]'s law).  Therefore, investigators must report as an adverse event the 
occurrence of either of the following:  
• Treatment -emergent ALT or AST >  3 x baseline value in combination with total 
bilirubin >  [ADDRESS_272694] (of which ≥ 35% is direct bilirubin)  
• Treatment -emergent ALT or AST >  [ADDRESS_272695] appropriate diagnosis or (if a diagnosis cannot be established) the abnormal 
laboratory values should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF (see  Section [IP_ADDRESS] ) 
and reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of 
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
Protocol  MO29518, Version  8 106 the event), either as a serious adverse event or a non- serious adverse event of special 
interest (see Section 5.4.2).  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Deaths 
For this protocol, mortality is an efficacy endpoint.  Deaths that occur during the protocol -
specified adverse event reporting period (see Section 5.3.1 ) that are attributed by [CONTACT_226877]/Early Discontinuation eCRF.  All 
other on- study deaths, regardless of relationship to study drug, must be recorded on the 
Adverse Event eCRF and immediately reported to the Sponsor (see Section 5.4.2),  
Death should be considered an outcome and not a distinct event.  The event or condition that caused or contributed to the fatal outcome should be recorded as the single medical concept on the Adverse Event eCRF.  Generally, only one such event should be 
reported.  The term "sudden death " should be used only for the occurrence of an 
abrupt and unexpected death due to presumed cardiac causes in a patient with or 
without preexisting heart disease, within [ADDRESS_272696] seen alive 
and stable.  If the cause of death is unknown and cannot be ascertained at the time of reporting, "unexplained death"  should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.  If the 
cause of death later becomes available (e.g., after autopsy), "unexplained death" should be replaced by [CONTACT_25749].  
During survival follow -up, deaths attributed to progression of one of the advanced solid 
tumors included in this study should be recorded only on the Survi val eCRF.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Preexisting Medical Conditions  
A preexisting medical condition is one that is present at the screening visit for this study.  
Such conditions should be recorded on the General Medical History and Baseline 
Conditions eCRF.  
A preexisting medical condition should be recorded as an adverse event only  if the 
frequency, severity, or character of  the condition worsens during the study.  When 
recording such events on the Adverse Event eCRF, it is important to convey the concept 
that the preexisting condition has changed by [CONTACT_9672] (e.g., "more frequent headaches").

Protocol  MO29518, Version  8 107 [IP_ADDRESS]  Lack of Efficacy or Worsening of the Advanced Solid Tumors 
Included in This Study  
Events that are clearly consistent with the expected pattern of progression of the 
underlying disease should not  be recorded as adverse events.  These data will be 
captured as efficacy assessment data only.  In most cases, the expected pattern of 
progression will be based on RECIST v1.1 (except for prostate cancer and malignant 
pleural mesothelioma) and disease -specific criteria for patients with prostate cancer (see 
Appendix 6) and malignant pleural mesothelioma (see Appendix 7) and modified RECIST (see Appendix 3). In rare cases, the determination of clinical progression will be 
based on symptomatic deterioration.  However, every effort should be made to 
document progression through use of objective criteria.  If there is any uncertainty as to whether an event is due to disease progression, it should be reported as an adverse event.

[IP_ADDRESS]  Adverse Events Associated with an Overdose or Error in Drug 
Administration 
An overdose is the accidental or intentional use of a drug in an amount higher than the 
dose being studied.  An overdose or incorrect administration of study treatment is not itself an adverse event, but it may result in an adverse event.  All adverse even ts

Protocol  MO29518, Version  [ADDRESS_272697] administration of study drug should be 
recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.  If the associated adverse event fulfills seriousness criteria, the event should be reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Section  5.4.2 ). 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Adverse Events in Individuals Not Enrolled in the Study  
If an adverse event inadvertently  occurs in an individual not enrolled in the study 
(e.g., during administration of study drug), the Adverse Event Form provided to 
investigators should be completed and submitted to the Sponsor or its designee, either by [CONTACT_25750].  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Infusion related reactions  
Adverse events that occur during or within 24 hours after study drug administration and are judged to be related to study drug infusion should be captured as a diagnosis infusion- related reaction on the Adverse Event eCRF.  If possible, avoid ambiguous 
terms such as "systemic reaction."  Associated signs and symptoms should be recorded 
on the dedicated Infusion- Related Reaction eCRF.  If a patient experiences both a local 
and systemic reaction to the same dose of study drug, each reaction should be recorded 
separately on the Adverse Event eCRF, with signs and symptoms also recorded separately on the dedicated Infusion- Related Reaction eCRF.

• Pregnancies (see Section 5.4.3 for further details)  
 
The investigator must report new significant follow -up information for these events to the 
Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after becoming aware of the 
information).  New significant information includes the following:  
• New signs or symptoms or a change in the diagnosis  
• Significant new diagnostic test results  
• Change in causality based on new information 
• Change in the event’s outcome, including recovery  
• Additional narrative information on the clinical course of the event

and sent to [COMPANY_002] Drug Safety.  The investigator should discontinue study drug and counsel the patient, discussing the risks of the pregnancy and the possible effects on the fetus.  Monitoring of the patient should continue until conclusion of the pregnancy.  Any 
serious adverse events associated with the pregnancy (e.g., an event in the fetus, an 
event in the mother  during or after the pregnancy, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect in 
the child) should be reported on the Adverse Event eCRF.  
In the event that the EDC system is unavailable, the Clinical Trial Pregnancy Reporting Form provided to investigators should be completed and submitted to the Sponsor or its designee immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the pregnancy), either by [CONTACT_123567].  Once the EDC system is available, all information will

abortions to be medically significant), recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, and 
reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the 
event; see Section 5.4.2 ).   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Congenita l Anomalies/Birth Defects  
Any congenital anomaly/birth defect in a child born to a female patient exposed to study drug or the female partner of a male patient exposed to study drug should be classified as a serious adverse event, recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, and reported to the 
Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see 
Section 5.4.2 ).

(e.g. a biomarker positive subgroup) then statistical analysis may be performed based 
on this subgroup of patients. In general, within s ection 6, the term cohort is used to refer 
to a group of patients to be analyzed together (whether this is a cohort, a sub- cohort or a 
subgroup).  
The safety population  will be the main population for all analyses  (demographics, 
efficacy and safety) unless otherwise stated. For each cohort, the safety population will 
include all patients who have received at least one dose of study medication.  
For each cohort, the intent -to-treat (ITT) population will include all patients enrolled in the 
study irrespective of whether they have received study medication or not. The ITT 
population will be used to summarize disposition data.  
The evaluation of each cohort at the end of Stage I and Stage II will be based only on 
data from fully evaluable patients, defined as patients receiving at least one dose of 
Atezolizumab and having at least one tumor assessment post- baseline (per protocol 
mandated timelines).  
The per -protocol (PP) population will not be defined due to the small number of patients 
per cohort, but major protocol deviations will be listed.  
The study will be analyzed for the primary efficacy variable at the end of Stage I and 
Stage II.  All cohorts will also be analyzed at Week 24 (6months) and at the end of 
cohort. In case a cohort is closed before reaching 12 patients (e.g., due to accrual problems), data for that cohort will be listed only or pooled with cohort 10. The end of cohort analysis for each cohort will take place when all patients in that cohort have been 
followed for survival for a minimum of [ADDRESS_272711].  
6.1 DETERMINATION OF SAM PLE SIZE 
The sample size for  this phase II study is based on Simon’s optimal two- stage design 
(Simon 1989). 
In this Phase II study, an NPR of 20% is a level of activity that is not of interest for further 
clinical development, whereas an NPR of 40% is of clinical interest.  The type I error will 
be 10% and the study will have 80% power to reject the null hypothesis when the true NPR is 40%.

timelines) .  Thus, more than 25 patients may be needed to be enrolled per cohort to 
obtain 25 fully -evaluable patients.  
The hypotheses and clinical assumptions will be applied to all cohorts individually.  
Statistical analyses will be based on patients with the same individual tumor type and may be based on pre- defined cohorts or on sub- cohorts  
If a clear clinical benefit has been observed for a defined subgroup of patients at the end of Stage I within a cohort that did not meet the criteria for continuation (as described in Section 6.2.1 ), then enrolment into Stage II might still be allowed in this cohort  for this 
specific subgroup after discussion with the Sponsor and the study Steering Committee. 
Similarly, if a clear clinical benefit has been observed for a defined subgroup of patients 
at the end of Stage II within a cohort that did not meet the criteria for s uccess (as 
described in Section 6.2.2 ), then enrolment into Stage II might continue in this cohort for 
this specific subgroup after discussion with the Sponsor and the study Steering 
Committee.

6.2.1  Rules for Stage I 
• Enrolment into the cohort may  continue into Stage II if more than 2 patients (out of 
12) with non- progressive disease at Week 18 are observed at the end of Stage I.  
• Enrolment into the cohort will stop at the end of Stage I if the number of patients 
with non- progressive disease (confirmed or unconfirmed) is 2, 1 or 0 out of 12 patients. 
However, if the overall patient population does not meet requirements at Stage I, but a 
clinical benefit is observed in a specific subgroup (e.g. biomarker positive subgroup) of patients, then only this subgroup may be added for Stage I and Stage II to reach numbers as explained in the Sample Size Estimation.   
All decisions above will be made by [CONTACT_226878].   

Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
Protocol  MO29518, Version  8 115 6.2.2  Rules for Stage II 
A study treatment will be considered to be promising for a given cohort in Stage II if:  
• there is no unacceptable toxicity, and 
• at 18 weeks, there are 8 or more patients with non- progressive disease out of 25 
fully-evaluable patients.  
 
If the overall patient population does not meet the Stage II  criteria, but a clinical benefit is 
observed in a specific subgroup (e.g. biomarker positive subgroup) of patients, then 
Stage II may be expanded to include additional patients from this specific subgroup in 
order to re- evaluate the Stage II criteria in this patient subgroup.  
Additionally, other efficacy endpoints and safety may also be evaluated for a final 
decision at the end of Stage II.

6.4 SUMMARIES OF TREATMENT GROUP COMPARABILI TY 
This is an open- label phase 2 study that will assess Atezolizumab administered at a

be assessed at Stage I and Stage II. The number and percentage of progression- free 
patients will be presented along with the corresponding Clopper -Pearson 95% 
confidence interval.  
Hypothesis Testing 
A Simon optimal two- stage design will be used to test whether Atezolizumab yields a 
NPR that is of clinical interest.  In this Phase II study, an NPR of 20% is a level of activity that is not of interest for further clinical development, whereas an NPR of 40% is of clinical interest.

Protocol  MO29518, Version  8 116 The study hypotheses are:  
• H 0: π ≤ π0 
• H 1: π > π 1 
 
Where π 0 = 20% and the assumed NPR under the alternative is π 1 = 40%.  
The type I error will be 10% and the study will have 80% power to reject the null 
hypothesis when the true NPR is 40%. 
The hypothesis and clinical assumptions will be applied to all cohorts separately. This is 
an early phase II study and cohorts are independent, hence there will be no adjustment 
for multiplicity.  
6.5.2  Secondary Efficacy  Endpoints  
The number and percentage of progression -free patients at 24 weeks will be presented 
along with the corresponding Clopper -Pearson 95% confidence interval. The ORR, BOR 
and CBR will be analyzed in a similar way.   
The time- to-event variables, DOR, PFS, TTP and OS, will be presented graphically 
using the Kaplan- Meier (KM) approach. Estimates together with the associated 95% 
confidence interval will be reported for the median and for the 1- year and 2- year survival

7.3 SOURCE DATA DOCUMENT AT IO N  
Study monitors will perform ongoing source data verification to confirm that critical 
protocol data (i.e., source data) entered into the eCRFs by [CONTACT_26831], complete, and verifiable from source documents.  
Source documents (paper or electronic) are those in which patient data are recorded and documented for the first time.  They include, but are not limited to,  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], 
clinical and office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, patient -reported outcomes, 
evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data from automated instruments, copi[INVESTIGATOR_162411], microfiche, photographic negatives, microfilm or magnetic media, X -rays, 
patient files, and records kept at pharmacies, laboratories, and medico- technical 
departments involved in a clinical trial.  
Before study initiation, the types of source documents that are to be generated will be 
clearly defined in the Trial Monitoring Plan.  This includes any protocol data to be 
entered directly into the eCRFs (i.e., no prior written or electronic record of the data) and considered source data.  
Source documents that are required to verify the validity and completeness of data entered into the eCRFs must not be obliterated or destroyed and must be retained per the policy for retention of records described in Section 7.5.

7.4 USE OF COMPUTERIZED SYSTEMS 
When clinical observations are entered directly into a study site’s computerized medical 
record system (i.e., in lieu of original hardcopy records), the electronic record can serve 
as the source document if the system has been validated in accordance with health authority requirements pertaining to computerized systems used in clinical research.  An acceptable computerized data collection system allows preservation of the original entry 
of data.  If original data are modified, the system should maintain a viewable audit trail 
that shows the original data as well as the reason for the change, name [CONTACT_25773], and date of the change.

patient's illness.  Tumor blocks are preferred; 15 freshly cut and unstained slides can be provided in e xceptional circumstances if tumor blocks 
are unavailable.  Patients with fewer than 15 unstained slides available at baseline (but no fewer than 10) may be eligible f ollowing discussion 
with the Sponsor.  Patients who do not have tissue specimens meeting e ligibility requirements must undergo a biopsy during the screening 
period. Alternatively, the biopsy during screening can be replaced by a biopsy which was taken no more than 12 months before Cycle 1, Day 1.  
Acceptable samples include core needle biopsies for deep tumor tissue (minimum three cores) or excisional, incisional, punch, or forceps 
biopsies for cutaneous, subcutaneous, or mucosal lesions.

Modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (cont.)
MEA SUR ABLE LESIONS
Tumor Lesions.  Tumor lesions must be accurately  measured in at least one dimension (longest 
diam eter in the plane of measurement is to be recorded) with a minimum size as follows: 
1. 10 mm by [CONTACT_20420] (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan (CT/MRI 
scan slice thickness/interval no greater than 5 mm)
2. 10- mm caliper measurement by [CONTACT_12148] (lesions that cannot be accurately 
measured with calipers should be recorded as non -measurable)
Malignant Lymph Nodes.  To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, alymph 
node must be 15 mm in the short axis when assessed by [CONTACT_70182] (CT scan slice thickness 
recommended to be no greater than 5 mm).  At baseline and follow -up, only  the short axis will be 
measured an d followed.  
NON -MEA SURA BLE LESIO NS
Non-measurable tumor lesions encompass small lesions (longest diam eter 10mmor 
pathological lymph nodes with short axis 10 but 15 mm), as well as truly non-measurable 
lesions.  Lesions considered truly non-measurable include leptomeningeal disease, ascites, 
pleural or pericardial effusion, inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitic involvement of skin or 
lung, peritoneal spread, and abdominal mass/abdominal organomegaly identified by [CONTACT_226885] t measurable by [CONTACT_128694].
SPECIA L CONSIDERA TIONS REG ARDING LESION MEA SUR ABILITY
Bone lesions, cystic lesions, and lesions previously treated with local therapy require particular 
comment, as outlined below.
BONE LESIONS
Bone scan, positron emission tomography (PET) scan, or plain films are not considered adequate 
imaging techniques for measuring bone lesions.  However, these techniques can be used to 
confirm the presence or disappearance of bone lesions.Lytic bone lesions or mixed lytic–blastic 
lesions, with identifiable soft tissue components, that can be evaluated by [CONTACT_12783] -sectional imaging 
techniques such as CT or MRI can be considered as measurable lesions if the soft tissue 
component meets the definition of measurability describ ed above. Blastic bone lesions are non-
measurable.
CYSTIC LESIONS
Lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts should not be considered 
as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non-measurable) since they are, by [CONTACT_108], 
simple cysts. Cystic lesions thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as 
measurable lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability described above.  However, if 
non-cystic lesions are present in the same patient, these are preferred for selection as target 
lesions.
LESIONS WITH PRIOR L OCA L TREA TMENT
Tumor lesions situated in a previously irradiated area or in an area subjected to other loco-
regional therapy are usually not considered measurable unless there has been demonstrated 
progr ession in the lesion.  Study protocols should detail the conditions under which such lesions 
would be considered measurable.

7DUJHW/HVLRQV
When more than one measurable lesion is present at baseline, all lesions up to a maximum of 
five lesions total (and a maximum of two lesi ons per organ) representat ive of all inv olved organs 
should be identified as target lesions and will be recorded and measured at baseline.  This means that, for instances in which patients have only one ortwo organ site s involved, a maximum of two 
lesions (onesite) and four lesions (twosites), re spectively, will be recorded.   Other lesions (albeit 
measurable) in those organs will be recorded as non-measurable lesions (even if the size is 
#10mm by [CONTACT_70182]).  
Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter) 
and be representative of all involved organs, but in addition, should lend themselves to 
reproducible repeated measurements.  It may be the case that, onoccasion, the largest lesion 
does not lend itself to reproducible measurement, inwhich circumstance, the next largest lesion 
that can be measured reproducibly shouldbe selected.
Lymph nodes merit special mention since they ar e normal anatomical structures thatmay be 
visible by [CONTACT_33490].   As noted above, pathological nodes that are 
defined as measurable and may be identified as target lesions must meet the criterion of a short 
axis of %[ADDRESS_272774] in 
which the image is obtained (for CT, this is  almost always the axial plane; for MRI, the plane 
ofacquisition may be axial, sagittal, or coronal).  The smaller of these measures isthe short axis.  
For example, an abdominal node that is reported as being 20mm ∋30 mm has a shortaxis of 
20mm and qualifies as a malignant, measurablenode.  In this example, 20 mm should be 
recorded as the node measurem ent.  All other pathological nodes (those with short axis %10 mm 
but &15mm) should be considered non-target lesions.  Nodes that have a short axis of &10 mm 
are considered non-pathological and should not be recorded or followed. Lesions irradiated within 3 weeks prior to Cycle 1, Day 1 may not be counted as target lesions.
1RQ7DUJHW/HVLRQV
All other lesions (or sites of disease), including pathological lymph nodes, should be identified as 
non-target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline.  Measurements are not required.
It is possible to record multiple non-target lesion s involving the same organ as a single item on 
the Case Report Form (CRF) (e.g., “multiple enlarged pelvic lymph nodes” or “multiple liver metastases”). 
After baseline, changes in non-tar get lesions will contr ibute only in the assessment ofcomplete 
response (i.e., a complete response is attained only with the complete disappearance of all tumor lesions, including non-target lesions) and will not be used toassess progressive disease. 
1HZ/HVLRQV
During the study, all new lesions identified and recorded after baseline must be 
assessed at all tumor assessment timepoints.  New lesions will also be evaluated for measurability with use of the same criteria applied to prospective target lesions at baseline per RECIST, (e.g., nonlymph node lesions must be 10mm; see note for new lymph node lesions below).  Up to a maximum of five new lesions total (and a maximum of two lesions per organ), all with measurements at all timepoints, can be 
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann- La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
Protocol MO29518 , Version 8 146Appendix 3
Modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (cont.)
included in the tumor response evaluation.  New lesion types that would not qualif y as 
target lesions per RECIST cannot be included in the tumor response evaluatio n.
New lesions that are not measurable at first appearance but meet measurability criteria 
at a subsequent timepoint will be measured from that point on and contribute to the 
sum of longest diameters (SLD), if the maximum number of 5 measurable new lesions
being followed has not been reached.
CALCULA TION OF SUM O F THE DIA METERS 
A sum of the diam eters (longest for non-nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) forall target 
lesions will be calculated as a measure of tumor burden.  
The sum of the diamete rs is calculated at baseline and at each tumor assessment for the purpose 
of classification of tumor responses.
Sum of the Diameters at Baseline :  The sum of the diam eters for all target lesions identified at 
baseline prior to treatment on Day 1.
Sum of the Diameters at Tumor Assessment :  For ever y on-study  tumor assessment collected 
per protocol or as clinically indicated, the sum of the diameters at tumor assessment will be 
calculated using tumor imaging scans.  All target lesions and all new measurable lesions that 
have emerged after baseline will contribute to the sum of the diam eters at tumor assessment.  
Hence, each net percentage change in tumor burden per assessment with use of modified 
RECIST accounts for the size and growth kinetics of both old a nd new lesions as they appear. 
Note:  In the case of new lymph nodes, RECIST v1.1 criteria for measurability (equivalent to baseline 
target lesion selection) will be follow ed.  That is, if at first appearance the short axis of a new lymph node 
lesion 15mm, it will be considered a measureable new lesion and will be tracked and included in the 
SLD.  Thereafter, the lymph node lesion will be measured at subsequent timepoints and measurements will 
be included in the SLD, even if the short axis diameter decr eases to 15 mm (or even 10mm).  However, 
if it subsequently decreases to 10 mm, and all other lesions are no longer detectable (or have also 
decreased to a short axis diameter of 10 mm if lymph nodes), then a response assessment of CR may be 
assig ned.
If at first appearance the short axis of a new lymph node is 10 mm and 15 mm , the lym ph node w ill not 
be considered measurable but will still be considered a new lesion. It will not be included in the SLD unless 
it subsequently becomes measurable (short axis diameter  15 mm).
The appearance of new lymph nodes with diameter 10 mm should not be considered pathological and not 
considered a new  lesion.
RESPONSE CRITERIA
Evaluation of Target Lesions
Complete Response (CR):  Disappearance of all target lesions.  Lymph nodes that shrink to 
10 mm short axis are considered normal.
Partial Response (PR):  At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of all target and all 
new measurable lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diam eters, in the absence of 
CR.
Note:  The appearance of new measurable lesions is factored into the overall tumor burden but 
does not automatically qualify  as progressive disease until the sum of the diameters increases by 
20% when compared with the sum of the diameters at nadir.
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann- La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
Protocol MO29518 , Version 8 147Appendix 3
Modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Soli d Tumors (cont.)
Stable Disease (SD):  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualif y for PR nor sufficient increase to 
qualif y for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum of the diameters while on study.
Progressive Disease (PD):  At least a 20% increase in thesum of diameters of all target and all 
new measurable lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study  (nadir SlD; this includes 
the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study ).  In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the 
sum must also demo nstrate an absolute increase of at least [ADDRESS_272775] measurable disease at baseline.
MISSING A SSESSMENTS AND NOT EVALUABLE DESIGNA TION
When no im aging/measurement is done at all at a particular timepoint, the patient is not evaluable 
(NE) at that timepoint.  If only a subset of lesion measurements are made at an assessment, 
usually the case is also considered NE at that timepoint, unless a convincing argument can be 
made that the contribution of the individual missing lesion(s) would not change the assigned time 
point response.  This w ould be most likely  to happen in the case of PD.  For example, if a patient 
had a baseline sum of [ADDRESS_272776] achieved PD status, reg ardless of 
the contribution of the missing lesion.

Prostate Response Evaluation Criteria
PROSTA TE-SPECIFIC A NTIGEN A SSESSMENT
Prostate -specific antigen (PSA) Assessment will be evaluated according to the 
recommendations of the Prostate Cancer Working Group 2 (PC WG2)1with modification
PSA complete response is defined as a PSA concentration < 0.5 ng/mL for two 
consecutive measurements separated by [CONTACT_2669] 3 weeks
PSA response will be defined as a PS A concentration < 50% of the PSA reference 
value occurring at any time after treatment is initiated. The PSA reference value will 
be the PSA concentration measured immediately prior to treatment
PSA decrease of ≥ 30% from baseline by W eek 12 will also be a ssessed
PSA progression is defined as follows:
–In patients where no decrease in PSA from baseline is documented, PSA 
progression is a ≥ 25% increase from the baseline value along with an increase 
in absolute value of 2ng/mL or more after 12 weeks of treatm ent. It should be 
confirmed by a second value obtained 3 or more weeks later
–In patients whose PSA nadir is < 100% of the baseline value, PSA progression 
is≥ 25% increase from the nadir and an absolute increase of 2 ng/mL or more 
from the nadir, confirmed by a second value obtained 3 or more weeks later
RADIOGRA PHIC ASSESSM ENT
Bone lesions
–Progression is defined as the appearance of two or more new lesions
–Progression should be confirmed by a repeat measurement at least 6 weeks 
later demonstrating additional new lesions
Soft tissue lesions
–Soft tissue lesions should be assessed according to the modified Response 
Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria v. 1.1
Patients should be kept on study until no longer experiencing clinical benefit as 
determined by [CONTACT_226888].

Protocol MO29518 , Version [ADDRESS_272782] criteria to malignant pleural mesothelioma 
are in the interpretation of the meaning and placement of the "longest uni -dimensional 
diameter" of the target tumor mass to be measured. 
The longest diameter of a tumor mass is frequently that which follows the inner curve of 
the chest wall.  Defining the limits of such a diameter is often problematical. 
When the tumor regresses with treatment, the line may cross an area outside the tumor 
margin because of the curve of t he chest wall.  This may produce difficulty with 
reproducibility of measurement.  Furthermore, the longest tumor diameter may be 
between two fixed structures, such as the thoracic vertebrae and the carina, and 
measurement in these areas may not fully refle ct tumor response. 
MODIFIED RECIST FOR MALIGNA NT PLEURA L ME SOTHELIOMA
Modified RECIST criteria have been published with particular reference to malignant 
pleural mesothelioma (By[CONTACT_226889], 2004)1:
Response to treatment is evaluated by [CONTACT_226890]- dimensional tumor thickness 
perpendicular to the chest wall in [ADDRESS_272783].  The sum of 
these 6 measurements is defined as the pleural uni -dimensional measure
Transverse cuts at least 1 cm apart and related to anatomical landmarks in the 
thorax were chosen to allow reproducible assessment at later time points
If a measurable tumor was present, transverse cuts in the upper thorax, above the 
level of the main bronchi division were preferred
At reassessment, pleural thickness was meas ured at the same position and at the 
same level by [CONTACT_226891]. This measurement did not necessarily represent 
the greatest tumor thickness at the level
Nodal, subcutaneous, and other bi -dimensionally measurable lesions were 
measured uni -dimensionall y based on the RECIST criteria
Uni-dimensional measurements were included to obtain the total tumor 
measurement
A confirmed response required repeat observation on [ADDRESS_272784] criteria for assessment of response in malignant 
pleural mesothelioma. Ann Oncol. 2004 Feb;15(2):257 -60.

Immune -mediated colitis has been associated with the administration of atezolizumab.  
Management guidelines for diarrhea or colitis are provided in Table 3 .
All events of diarrhea or colitis should be thoroughly evaluated for oth er more common 
etiologies.  For events of significant duration or magnitude or associated with signs of 
systemic inflammation or acute -phase reactants (e.g., increased C -reactive protein, 
platelet count, or bandemia):  Perform sigmoidoscopy (or colonoscopy , if appropriate) 
with colonic biopsy, with three to five specimens for standard paraffin block to check for 
inflammation and lymphocytic infiltrates to confirm colitis diagnosis.

IMMUNE -MEDI ATEDMYOC ARDITIS
Immune -mediated myocarditis has been associated with the administration of 
atezolizumab.  Immune -mediated myocarditis should be suspected in any patient 
presenting with signs or symptoms suggestive of myocarditis, including, but not limited to, 
laboratory (e.g., B -type natriuretic peptide) or cardiac imaging abnormalities, dyspnea, 
chest pain, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], fatigue, decreased exercise tolerance, or syncope.  Immune -
mediated myocarditis needs to be distinguished from myocarditis resulting from infection 
(commonly viral, e.g., in a patient who reports a recent history of gastrointestinal illness), 
ischemic events, underlying arrh ythmias, exacerbation of preexisting cardiac conditions, 
or progression of malignancy.  
All patients with possible myocarditis should be urgently evaluated by [CONTACT_33500], an ECG, a chest X -ray, an echocardiogram, and a cardiac MR I as 
appropriate per institutional guidelines.  A cardiologist should be consulted.  An 
endomyocardial biopsy may be considered to enable a definitive diagnosis and 
appropriate treatment, if clinically indicated.
Patients with signs and symptoms of myocard itis, in the absence of an identified 
alternate etiology, should be treated according to the guidelines in Table 6.

INFUSION -RELA TED REA CTIONS
No premedication is indicated for the administration of Cycle 1 of atezolizumab.  
However, patients who experience an infusion -related reaction (IRR) with Cycle 1 of 
atezolizumab may receive premedication with antihistamines or antipyretics/analgesics 
(e.g., acetaminophen) for subsequent infusions.  Metamizole (dipyrone) is prohibited in 
treating atezolizumab -associated IRRs because of its potential for causing 
agranulocytosis.
Guidelines for medical management of IRRs during Cycle 1 are provided in Table 7 .  For
subsequent cycles, IRRs should be managed according to institutional guidelines.

NEUROLOGIC DISORDERS
Myasthenia gravis and Guillain -Barrésyndrome have been observed with single -agent 
atezolizumab.  Patients may present with signs and symptoms of sensory and/or motor 
neuropathy.  Diagnostic work -up is essential for an accurate characterization to 
differentiate between alternative etiologies.  Management guidelines for neurologic 
disorders are provided in Table 10 .

IMMUNE -MEDI ATEDMENINGOENCEPHALITIS
Immune -mediated meningoencephalitis is an identified risk associated with the 
administration of atezolizumab.  Immune -mediated meningoencephalitis should be 
suspected in any patient presenting with signs or symptoms suggestive of meningitis or 
encephalitis, incl uding, but not limited to, headache, neck pain, confusion, seizure, motor 
or sensory dysfunction, and altered or depressed level of consciousness.  
Encephalopathy from metabolic or electrolyte imbalances needs to be distinguished from 
potential meningoence phalitis resulting from infection (bacterial, viral, or fungal) or 
progression of malignancy, or secondary to a paraneoplastic process.

RENA L EVENTS
Immune -mediated nephritis has been associated with the administration of atezolizumab.  
Eligible patients must have adequate renal function, and renal function, including serum 
creatinine, should be monitored throughout study treatment.  Patients with abnormal 
renal function should be evaluated and treated for other mor e common etiologies 
(including prerenal and postrenal causes, and concomitant medications such as 
non-steroidal anti -inflammatory drugs).  Refer the patient to a renal specialist if clinically 
indicated.  A renal biopsy may be required to enable a definiti ve diagnosis and 
appropriate treatment.
Patients with signs and symptoms of nephritis, in the absence of an identified alternate 
etiology, should be treated according to the guidelines in Table 12 .

IMMUNE -MEDI ATED MYOS ITIS
Immune -mediated myositis has been associated with the administration of atezolizumab.  
Myositis or inflammatory myopathies are a group of disorders sharing the common 
feature of inflammatory muscle inju ry; dermatomyositis and polymyositis are among the 
most common disorders. Initial diagnosis is based on clinical (muscle weakness, muscle 
pain, skin rash in dermatomyositis), biochemical (serum creatine kinase increase), and 
imaging (electromyography/MRI) features, and is confirmed with a muscle biopsy.
Patients with signs and symptoms of myositis, in the absence of an identified alternate 
etiology, should be treated according to the guidelines in Table 13.

HEMOPHA GOCYTIC LYMPH OHISTIOCYTOSIS A ND M ACROPHA GE 
ACTIVATION SYNDROME
Immune -mediated reactions may involve any organ system and may lead to 
hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) and macrophage activation syndrome (MAS).  
Patients with suspected HLH should be diagnosed according to published criteria by 
[CONTACT_70195] (2014).  A patient should be classified as having HLH if five of the 
following eight criteria are met:
Fever 38.5°C
Splenomegaly
Peripheral blood cytopenia consisting of at least two of the following:
–Hemoglobin 90g/L (9 g/dL) ( 100 g/L [10 g/dL] for infants 4 weeks old)
–Platel et count 100109/L (100,000/ L)
–ANC 1.0109/L (1000/L)
Fasting triglycerides 2.992 mmol/L (265 mg/dL) and/or fibrinogen 1.5g/L 
(150 mg/dL)

Low or absent natural killer cell activity
Ferritin 500mg/L (500 ng/mL)
Soluble interleukin 2 (IL- 2) receptor (soluble CD25) elevated [ADDRESS_272807] deviations 
above age- adjusted laboratory -specific norms
Patients with suspected MAS should be d iagnosed according to published criteria for 
systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis by [CONTACT_70196]. (2016).  A febrile patient should be 
classified as having MAS if the following criteria are met:
Ferritin 684mg/L (684 ng/mL)
At least two of the follo wing:
–Platelet count 181109/L (181,000/ L)
–AST 48U/L
–Triglycerides 1.761 mmol/L (156 mg/dL)
–Fibrinogen 3.6g/L (360 mg/dL)
Patients with suspected HLH or MAS should be treated according to the guidelines in 
Table 14.

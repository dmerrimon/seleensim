A. SPECIFIC AIMS – HYPOTHESIS:  
 
Null-Hypothesis:  
 
This research will test the following null-hypothesis:  
 
The diuretic combination of furosemide -metolazone is equivalent to furosemide -
hydrochl orothiazide in promoting diuresis for patients with congestive heart 
failure.  
 
Objective:  
To establish if there is a difference between furosemide -metolazone versus 
furosemide -hydrochlorothiazide in promoting diuresis in patients with congestive 
heart fail ure. 
Secondary Objectives:  
To determine the duration of action of furosemide as monotherapy and in 
combination with either hydrochlorothiazide or metolazone.  
To determine the effect of diuretic combination therapy on neurohormonal 
activation.  
To determine the relative influence of metolazone and hydrochlorothiazide on 
parameters predicting ventricular arrhythmias.  
 
B. BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE:  
Diuretics serve as a primary pharmacological treatment of congestive heart 
failure with  acute or chronic fl uid over load.  Loop diuretics, such as furosemide, 
are the most effective agents in producing diuresis.  These agents act to inhibit 
the sodium/chloride cotransport in the ascending limb of the loop of Henle, where 
25% of the filtered load of sodium is reabsorbed. 1,2,3,4,[ADDRESS_247058] at the distal convoluted tubule to inhibit sodium and 
chloride reabsorption.  These diuretics are comparatively less potent versus the 
loop diuretics for the reason that only 5% -10% of the fi ltered load of sodium is 
reabsorbed in the distal convoluted tubule.1,2,3,5  Metolazone, a quinazoline 
diuretic, has similar pharmacologic characteristics as the thiazides.  It acts 
primarily to inhibit sodium reabsorption at the distal convoluted tubule a nd to a 
lesser extent at the proximal convoluted tubule. 1,2,3,5,6  
Diuretic resistance occurs when a potent diuretic drug, such as furosemide, is 
given in therapeutic doses and fails to reduce extracellular fluid volume to the 
desired level in an edematou s patient.2,3,5,6  Diuretic resistance can simply occur 
as a result of excessive salt intake, patient noncompliance, or drug -induced 
 3 resistance.  Other forms of resistance include acute adaptation, postdiuretic 
retention, and chronic adaptation.  
Acute ada ptation limits the utility of single diuretic therapy by [CONTACT_207148] (NaCl).  When a loop diuretic is 
administered, it acts on the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle where it 
blocks the sodium re absorbing capacity.  Consequently, more sodium is 
delivered to the distal parts of the nephron.  Since the NaCl transport system in 
the distal convoluted tubule is unsaturated and load dependent, this increased 
NaCl delivery leads to increased NaCl reabsor ption. 2,3,4,5,[ADDRESS_247059] to inhibit sodium 
reabsorption in the di stal convoluted tubule.8  
With chronic administration of a loop diuretic, the constant increase in the 
concentration of solute that escapes from the loop of Henle floods the more distal 
regions of the nephron.  These cells undergo structural and functional  adaptive 
processes such as increasing the number of membrane Na+ -K+-ATPase pumps. 
The increase in Na+ -K+-ATPase pumps leads to an increased transport capacity 
of the distal nephron.  This adaptation is activated by [CONTACT_207149], which leads to a decrease in overall diuresis and seems to 
be an important cause of diuretic resistance.   Diuretics such as metolazone and 
hydrochlorothiazide that block the distal regions in the nephron would act to block 
this adaptation and i ncrease diuresis. 2,3,4,5,6,[ADDRESS_247060] day, the patients received an I.V. dose of 120 mg of 
 4 furosemide. The mean 24 -hour urine volume was 1810 ± 397.4 mL and the mean 
body weight was found to be 53.4 ± 9.3 kg. After the addit ion of 5 mg of oral 
metolazone, the 24 -hour urine volume was found to be 2470 ± 608.8 mL and the 
mean body weight was 51.2 ± 9.0 kg (P < 0.05).  
In addition, a study performed by [CONTACT_207150] a synergistic effect and resulted in 
decreased body weight, increased urine volume, and increased fractional sodium 
excretion.7  This study included twenty patients with severe congestive heart 
failure, six females and fourteen males, with a mean  age of 70.8 years and a 
proven diuretic resistance to furosemide (daily dose greater than 250mg).  These 
patients were given hydrochlorothiazide (25 -100 mg orally) in combination with 
furosemide.  This combination led to a mean reduction in body weight of  6.7 ± 
3.3 kg per patient. Mean daily urine volume increased from 1899 ± 958 ml to 
3065 ± 925 ml (P< 0.001) and fractional sodium excretion increased from 3.5 ± 
3.2% to 11.5 ± 9.0% (P<0.001).  
Restricting dietary sodium intake and administering a single diu retic drug will lead 
to clinical improvement in the majority of congestive heart failure patients.  
However, some patients with congestive heart failure even when given therapy 
with high -dose furosemide still have edema.  A major problem results when 
furos emide and a restricted diet fail to reduce the extracellular volume to the 
desired level.  The extreme fluid retention that results, if left untreated, may result 
in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  Loop diuretics have similar pharmacologic characteristics; 
therefore, ad ministering another loop diuretic is not a valid option.2,[ADDRESS_247061] synergistically to induce increased 
diuresis.7  The current guidelines for treating diuretic resistance in congestive 
heart failure patients recommend the metolazone -furosemide combination.14  
However, there is no evidence to conclude that this combination is superior to 
hydrochlorothiazide -furosemide in increasing diuresis.  
Sudden death is predominantly caused by [CONTACT_207151] (tachycardia or 
fibrillation). The interplay of a cardiac substrate for ventricular instability such as 
infarction or dysfunction with dilation and autonomic and electrolyte factors is 
central to the triggering of these arrhythmias.  The electrolyte and fluid shifts 
produced during diuresis may place patients with the substrate for ventricular 
arrhythmias at further risk due to the loss of potassium and magnesium.  
Monitoring of the patient’s rhythm by [CONTACT_207152].  Evaluation o f electrocardiographic parameters on the 
surface electrocardiogram including QRS and QT dispersion can predict the risk 
of ventricular instability in a patient undergoing physiologic changes such as 
diuresis.15,16   
Activation of the neurohormonal system i n response to heart failure serves as an 
initial adaptive mechanism but over time becomes maladaptive impairing the 
 5 function of the heart, vasculature, and kidneys.  Sympathetic activation has been 
demonstrated to be arrhythmogenic.17  Increases in angiote nsin II are deleterious 
in heart failure due to vasoconstriction, promotion of proximal renal tubule 
sodium reabsorption, and stimulates the release of additional neurohormones 
such as endothelin, aldosterone, vasopressin, and cytokines.  In addition, 
angiotensin II and high concentrations of aldosterone augment sympathetic 
activation.18,19  By [CONTACT_207153], diuretics reflexively increase the 
concentrations of renin, and thus angiotensin II and aldosterone.20,21  The 
natriuretic peptides, atrial and brai n natriuretic peptide (ANP and BNP), act in 
opposition to the renin -angiotensin -aldosterone system.[ADDRESS_247062] eff ective in promoting diuresis in congestive heart failure patients.  
The effects of both regimens on electrocardiographic parameters of ventricular 
instability and neurohormonal parameters will also be assessed as secondary 
objectives.  
C. PRELIMINARY STUDIES:  
To the best of our knowledge, there have been no studies comparing the efficacy 
of the two diuretic combinations.  
D. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS:  
Study  Design:  
This will be a randomized, double -blind, crossover study designed to compare 
the efficacy of hyd rochlorothiazide and metolazone in combination with stable 
doses of furosemide in congestive heart failure patients.  
The specific dose of hydrochlorothiazide will be determined by [CONTACT_39359]’s 
creatinine clearance. A creatinine clearance of 30 -50 mL/mi n will indicate a dose 
of 50 mg per day. A creatinine clearance of > 50 mL/min will indicate a dose of 
25 mg per day.5 If metolazone is added to their regimen, the specific dose will be 
determined using the equivalence ratio of 5 mg metolazone to 50 mg 
hydrochlorothiazide.8 
 6 Twenty -six subjects will be studied.  They will be recruited from the University of 
New Mexico Congestive Heart Failure Clinic.  
Inclusion criteria:  
▪ Age >18 years  
▪ Diagnosis of chronic congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction ≤45% 
▪ Currently on a stable regimen of furosemide consisting of a daily dose of [ADDRESS_247063] two weeks.  
▪ Patients receiving ACE -inhibitors and/or beta -blockers must be taking these 
medications for at least two weeks in stable doses.  
Exclusion criteri a: 
▪ Renal dysfunction (serum creatinine >2 mg/dl or creatinine clearance of <30 
ml/min as calculated by [CONTACT_207154])25 
▪ Hepatic dysfunction (AST and ALT >3 times the upper limit of the normal)  
▪ Hypokalemia (<4.0 mg/dl)  
▪ Concomitant treatmen t with any diuretic other than furosemide  (with the 
exception of spi[INVESTIGATOR_8407]).  
▪ Gout  
▪ Lupus erythematosus  
Study procedures:  
Study procedures will be performed at the University of New Mexico General 
Clinical Research Center.  
After obtaining written inform ed consent, patients will be randomly assigned to 
one of two groups.  Both groups will be admitted to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34092] a period of 
four days  (five nights)  on two separate occasions.  Daily sodium intake will be 
restricted to less than three grams per day, and fluid intake to less than three 
liters per day.  For the first twenty -four hours of each admission, both groups will 
continue their regular medication regimen to establish a baseline for the 
measured variables.  For the remaining three days, the patien ts will have either 
hydrochlorothiazide or metolazone added to the ir daily regimen of furosemide.  
Blinding and randomization will be maintained by [CONTACT_207155] 
(Nancy Morgan, R.Ph.).  The dose of the additional drug will be administered on e 
hour prior to the dose of furosemide to ensure adequate absorption.  After the 
initial four -day hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], the patients will undergo a washout period of one 
week where they will be sent home and continue on their  regular medication 
regimen.  When t he patients return for the next four -day period they will be 
treated with the alternate drug.  Patients will be asked to maintain a consistent 
 7 dietary intake (sodium, potassium, etc.) and drug therapy throughout the study, 
i.e. potassium supplements and dr ugs that promote s odium retention (NSAIDS, 
etc.).  Starting 3 days prior to each admission, the patients will be required to eat 
only the food provided by [CONTACT_207156].  The foods 
provided will be consistent with the dietary sod ium and fluid limitations.  
Study Variables:  
Hemodynamic measures :  During each admission, the patients’ blood pressure 
and pulse will be measured every hour for the first six hours, every two hours for 
the next six hours, and then every four hours for the remainder of the twenty -four 
hours on days one and two.  On days three and four, the patients’ blood pressure 
and pulse will be taken every six hours.  Weight will be measured at baseline, 
two hours, six hours, twelve hours, and twenty -four hours on days o ne and two.  
On days three and four weight be will be taken once daily in the morning.  
Renal, electrolyte, and endocrine parameters : Twenty -four hour urine will be 
collected daily.  Urinary output will be quantified at 2 hours, 6 hours, 12 hours, 
and 24 ho urs on days one , two,  and four and at 24 hours on day 3 .  In addition 
we will measure the following urinary variables: potassium, sodium, creatinine, 
aldosterone, and protein.  On day s one, two, and four,  blood samples wi ll be 
taken at baseline, 2 hours, 6  hours, 12 hours  and 24 hours after the dose of 
diuretic(s)  to determine changes in serum sodium, potassium, chloride, 
bicarbonate, uric acid, creatinine, magnesium, blood urea nitrogen .  In addition 
blood samples will be taken on the same days and times t o determine changes 
in: catecholamines, angiotensin II, plasma renin, aldosterone, and brain 
natriuretic peptide.  On day three  blood will be obtained [ADDRESS_247064] diuretics to 
monitor serum electrolytes as a safety precaution.   
Measures of ventricular ins tability : A standard 12 -lead electrocardiogram (ECG) 
will be performed at the fol lowing times : time 0, [ADDRESS_247065]-dose.  The QT and QRS intervals will be measured on all ECG’s. QRS 
dispersion and QT dispersion will be calculated on  all ECG’s and defined as the 
maximum difference in the QRS and QT intervals.  
 
Statistical Analysis:  
The main analysis will be repeated measures ANOVA with day  (comparison to 
baseline)  and added drug (due to crossover) as repeated factors. Post -hoc 
testing  will be done using paired t -tests.   
The sample size was calculated based on the primary outcome variable, the 
mean difference in 24 -hour urinary output in milliliters (mL).  For simple and 
robust power analysis, the paired t -test that compares 24 -hour ur inary output on 
day 3 with each added drug was used.  We determined a mean difference in 
change from baseline in 24 -hour urinary output of 3 00 ml between the 
furosemide -metolazone and furosemide -hydrochlorothiazide regimens to be 
 8 clinically significant.  Previous studies with furosemide and hydrochlorothiazide 
and furosemide and metolazone demonstrated mean 24 -hour urinary outputs ± 
s.d. of 1899 ± 958 ml and 1810 ± 397 ml at baseline with furosemide 
monotherapy and 3065  ± 925 ml and 2470  ± [ADDRESS_247066] the 3 00 ml difference with 80% power at  a 5% 
level of significance.  This is reasonable since comparison of the two referenced 
studies found a difference in the change from baseline of 506 ml.7,10  Accounting 
for a 25% dropout rate, 26 subjects will be enrolled in the study.  
All statistical analysis wi ll be performed using SAS v6.12.  
Potential assumptions and limitations:  
A major limitation to the study is that patients included in the study are clinically 
stable and therefore the results may not be generalizable to decompensated 
CHF patients.  For the purposes of our study we are assuming that the patients 
will remain on the same drug therapy, as well as sodium and fluid intake 
throughout the study, so as not to introduce any additional variables.  We are 
also assuming that the dose of metolazone given to the patients is equivalent to 
the dose of hydrochlorothiazide.  The fact that there is no way of determining an 
exact equivalent dosage limits our study.  Another limitation is the fact that our 
patients will only be receiving the additional drug and be ing monitored for [ADDRESS_247067].  Therefore 
in practice, where the drug may be given over a greater period of time, diuresis 
and adverse effects may be more pronounced.

The risk:benefit ratio of this study is fairly low.  
 
F. JUSTIFICATION FOR UTILIZATION OF GCRC:  
 
The use of GCRC resources is important for the success of this study.  This is an 
investigator -initiated clinical project operating on very limited outside resources.  
Patients are not acutely ill, and cannot therefore be housed else where in the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. The expertise of the GCRC nursing staff i s needed to perform blood 
draws, collect urine, obtain elect rocardiographic data, and vital signs all of which 
are integral for the success of the study.

L. SUMMARY -ABSTRACT:  
Objective:   To establish which combination of diuretics is the most effective in 
promoting diuresis in congest ive heart failure patients.  Secondary Objectives:  
To determine the duration of action of furosemide as monotherapy and in 
combination with either hydrochlorothiazide or metolazone.  To determine the 
effect of diuretic combination therapy on neurohormonal  activation.  
Background:   Diuretic resistance occurs when a potent diuretic drug, such as 
furosemide, is given in therapeutic doses and fails to reduce extracellular fluid 
volume to the desired level in an edematous patient.  Studies have shown that 
metol azone and hydrochlorothiazide have demonstrated a synergistic response 
when used in combination with furosemide in congestive heart failure patients.  
The current guidelines for treating diuretic resistance in congestive heart failure 
patients recommend th e metolazone -furosemide combination.  However, there is 
no evidence to conclude that this combination is superior to hydrochlorothiazide -
furosemide in increasing diuresis.  Methods:   Randomized, double -blind, 
crossover study to compare the efficacy of hydr ochlorothiazide and metolazone 
in combination with stable doses of furosemide in 26 patients with congestive 
heart failure.  The primary endpoint will be change in urinary output.  Secondary 
endpoints will be changes in weight, neurohormones (angiotensin I I, 
catecholamines, brain natriuretic peptide, aldosterone), and electrocardiographic 
parameters of ventricular instability.  Study procedures will be performed at the 
UNM General Clinical Research Center.  Patients will be hospi[INVESTIGATOR_80529] 2 
separate 4 -day admissions, separated by a 1 -week washout period.  At each 
 13 admission each patient will receive furosemide in combination with either 
metolazone or hydrochlorothiazide (metolazone for one admission and 
hydrochlorothiazide for the other).  Following adminis tration of combination 
therapy, blood and urine samples will be collected throughout the day to chart the 
onset and magnitude of effect of each treatment regimen.  Various 
hemodynamic, renal, endocrine, and neurohormonal parameters will be assesed 
as will the effect of each combination treatment on ventricular instability using [ADDRESS_247078] to analyze intertreatment 
differences. All statistical  analysis will be performed using SAS v6.12.

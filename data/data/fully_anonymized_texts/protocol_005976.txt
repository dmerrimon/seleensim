to the study  lenses. 
The site personnel will educate subjects on proper hy giene and lens handling, and compliance 
with the use of contact [CONTACT_13287]. Subjects sho uld be instructed not to 
wear contact [CONTACT_13288][INVESTIGATOR_13263]. The site personnel will also advise the

conduct the following procedures: 
Collect AE and Device Deficiency information
Assess and record changes in medical condition or concomitant medication 
Assess and record V As
Perform biomicroscop y (assessments with or without lenses, as possible)
In addition, all procedures for Unscheduled V isit/Earl y Exit should be completed (as 
possible). The Investigator may perform additional pr ocedures for proper diagnosis and 
treatment of the subject. The Investigator must document this information in the subject ’s 
case history  source documents.
If during an Unscheduled V isit the subject is discontinuing the study  lenses or discontinuing 
from t he study , the Investigator must conduct Exit procedures according to Table 1

Schedule of Study  Procedures and Assessments , as possible.
5.3 Discontinued Subjects
Discontinued subjects are those who withdraw or are withdrawn from the study  after signing 
the informed consent, including screen failures. Subjects may discontinue from the study  at 
any time for any  reason. Subjects may  also be discontinued from the study at any  time if, in

Discontinued subjects will not be replaced (ie, their subject numbers will not be 
re-assigned/re -used).
Should a subject exhibit any  clinically  relevant signs, s ymptoms, or other clinical 
observations that possibly  could be associated wit h suspected sensitivity  or intolerance to one 
of the study  treatments, the Investigator must document those observations on an AE Form.
Any subject who exits early  from the study  (excluding screen failures) must undergo all Exit 
procedures according to Table 1-1: Schedule of Study  Procedures and Assessments .
The Investigator must document the reason for study  or treatment discontinuation in the 
subject ’s case history  source documents.
To ensure the safet y of all subjects who discontinue earl y, Investigators must assess each 
subject and, if necessary , advise them of an y therapi[INVESTIGATOR_13265]/or medical procedures that may be 
needed to maintain their health.
5.4 Clinical Study Termination
The Study  Sponsor reserves the right to close the investigational site or terminate the study  in 
its entirety  at any  time, for reasonable cause.
If the clinical stud y is prematurely terminated or suspended by [CONTACT_13295]:
The Study  Sponsor must :
oImmediately  notify  the Investigator (s) and subsequently  provide 
instructions for study  termination.
oInform the Investigator and the regulatory  authorities of the 
termination/suspension and the reason(s) for the termination/suspension , 
as applicable.
The Investigator must:
oPromptly  notify  the IRBof the termination or suspension and of the 
reasons. 
oProvide subjects with recommendations for post
-study  treatment options 
as needed.
The Investigator may  terminate a site ’s participation in the study  for reasonable cause.

associated with patient harm (ie, ADE or SADE); however , not all ADEs or SADEs are due 
to a device deficiency . The Investigator should determine the applicable category  listed in the 
Device Deficiency  eCRF for the identified or suspect device deficiency  and report an y patient 
harm separately . Examples of device deficiencies include the following: 
Failure to meet product specifications (eg, incorrect lens power/diameter/base 
curve/color)
Lens cloud y
Lens surface/edge defect 
Torn lens during handling/in pack
Packaging deficit (eg, mislabeled product, tampered seal, leaking bottle/container)
Suspect product contamination
Lack of performance

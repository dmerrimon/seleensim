Background , Rationale  and Context  
Postoperative voiding trials (VT) are performed after reconstructive pelvic surgery due to the 
heightened risk of transient urinary retention. Studies have reported rates of post -operative urinary 
retention followi ng surgery for vaginal prolapse ranging from 6 -29%, higher than after vaginal 
hysterectomy for non -prolapse indications. Patients who are unable to successfully void after surgery may 
be discharged home with an indwelling transurethral cath eter for several  days until a voiding trial may be 
repeated in the office. Indwelling catheters are associated with an increased risk in urinary tract infection 
(UTI), increased discomfort and poor patient satisfaction. It has been shown that duration of 
catheterization i s the most important determinant of developi[INVESTIGATOR_161057]. Several studies have been 
performed comparing the length of time a Foley catheter is left in place after a gynecologic surgery. 
Overall, earlier catheter removal reduces rates of U TI, but has been  associated with a higher risk of 
urinary retention and re -catheterization. VTs aid in the decision -making process as to whether or not a 
patient is a candidate for early discontinuation of a Foley catheter. With the recent trend toward 
minimally invasive and outpatient surgeries, patients are frequently discharged home on the day of 
surgery. In such cases , patients undergo a voiding trial in the recovery room on the same day of surgery, 
prior to discharge . Patients who are successfully able  to empty their bladders may be  discharged without a 
catheter. Those who are unsuccessful have a Foley catheter re -inserted and are discharged with an 
appointment sched uled for an office voiding trial . The length of time to repeat a voiding trial after an 
initially failed  trial has yet to be studied.  
 
Objective s 
Primary Objective  
The primary objective of this study is to determine the timing to return to normal bladder 
function after pelvic floor reconstructive surgery for those patients who failed the init ial post -
operati ve VT. To assess this, the rate of failure of repeat VT will be assessed at two post -
operative time points . 
Secondary Objectives  
To evaluate:  
 The rates of UTI  in the two groups  
 Rates of Foley catheter re -insertion  after passing a subsequent  office void tri al 
 Patient Satisfaction  
 
Methods and Measures  
 
Design  
This study is a randomized controlled trial designed to assess t he timing of return to normal 
bladder function after pelvic floor reconstructive surgery. The primary outcome will be asse ssed 
by [CONTACT_147036] g office VT failure rates between those who return in the early post -operative period 
(2-4 days) vs the standard time to return for an office VT (1 week) . Based on the Hakvoort et al 
 3 study and a 95 tw o-sided significance level and 8 0% power , this study wou ld require 60 subjects, 
or 30  per group. Assuming a 10% dro p-out rate, [ADDRESS_186963] -operative day 
(POD) #[ADDRESS_186964] will be  called on POD#1  and randomized to either the early voiding trial 
group (EVT) or the late voiding trial group (LVT). Subjects in EVT will be scheduled for a r epeat 
VT on POD#2 -4, whereas those in LVT will be scheduled for a repeat VT on or after POD#7. 
Subjects that are u nsuccessful in the repeat VT will have a Foley catheter re -inserted and will 
return for another VT in [ADDRESS_186965] the 
Foley catheter replaced and will return for another office VT aft er waiting an ad ditional 5 -7 days 
or will be started on clean intermittent self -catheterization.  
 
Subjects will be monitored for a 6 week period. During that time the patient will be monitored for 
voiding and urinary symptoms. Urine will be tested via in -office urinalysis  at each office visit (as 
per usual practice), including pre -operatively, and will be sent for a urine culture per usual 
practice based upon abnormal urinalysis results (ie. any blood or leukocytes). Urine cultures that 
grow out a single or ganism >10,[ADDRESS_186966] meet t he following inc lusion criteria in order to be eligible 
for the study  
 Female patients age 18 or older  
 Speak English and are capable of giving informed consent  
 Are willing to return to the office for all necessary visits associated with the 
study  
 Underwent  outpatient gynec ology pelvic floor surgery for multi -compartment 
prolapse  
 Failed the voiding trial in the recovery room  on POD#[ADDRESS_186967] any of the following exclusion criteria in order to 
be eligible for the study  
 Pre-operative urinary retention as defined as PVR > 200ml  
 Prior incontinence surgery  
 Passed the voiding trial in the recovery room  
 4  Require prolonged catheterization due to urethral/bladder abnormality (ie 
vesicovaginal fistula, urethral diverticulum) or intra -op urethral or bla dder 
injury or for intensive post -operative monitoring   
 Patients who take  any post -operative antibiotics , other than prophylaxis 
during catheterization, for reasons other than a UTI as diagnosed and 
prescribed as part of the study  
 Patients who take any sup plements to prevent UTIs, including but not limited 
to D-Mannose, Hiprex, or Ellura  
 Have any neurological conditions that may affect bladder function (ie. 
Multiple sclerosis, spi[INVESTIGATOR_32692], etc.)  
 Patients with pre -operative narcotic  medication use due to chronic pain  
 Sample Size  
Using OpenEpi.com and the Fleiss statistical method the sample size was calculated for a 
randomized controlled trial based on the Hakvoort et al. study. With a 95% two -sided significance 
and an 80% power, thi s study will nee d [ADDRESS_186968] for the 
primary outcome of differences in Foley catheter re -insertion rates.  
 This is a multi -center study. The coordinating institution is the  Cleveland Clinic 
[LOCATION_012] in Weston, FL. The study has been approv ed and enrollment is underway at 
that site. Over [ADDRESS_186969] Health in North Carolina.  
 
Intervention s and Interactions  
 As described above, if the patient does not pass the recovery room VT, a Foley catheter will 
be inserted for either 2 -4 or 7 days de pending on the randomization. Prophylactic antibiotics 
may be used per the surgeon’s preference. Length of catheter duration will depend on when 
the patient is ab le to pass an outpatient VT.  
 As described above, urine cultures will be performed as medically  indicated. A single 
identified organism of 10,000 CFU or greater will be considered a positive culture.  
 Pre-operative and post -operative questionnaires will be used to assess patient satisfaction 
with their voiding/ Foley catheter use.  
 Office notes will be reviewed to assess for study eligibility. Background data will be 
collected for descriptive statistics. Data from urodynamic studies will also be collected as part 
of the background data. Post -operative notes from the clinic will be reviewed to assess f or 
any complications or adverse events. Surgical and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_161058]: type of surgery, post -op narcotic use, length of surgery, time t o recovery room void

Consent to Participate in a Research Study  
 
Study title:  Timing of repeat void trial after outpatient multi -compartment prolapse reconstruction      
You are being invited to participate in a research study.  A research stud y is designed to answer 
specific questions about new ways to prevent, detect, and treat disease.  Being in a research study 
is different from being a patient.  The purpose of this document is to provide a written summary 
of the discussion and exchange of r esearch information you had with the research team.  It is also 
for use as a reference during the study.   
 
Please note:  
 You are being asked to participate in a research study  
 Ask as many questions as needed so you can make an informed decision.  
 Carefully consider the risks, benefits , and alternatives of the research  
 Your decision to participate is completely voluntary and will have no effect on the 
quality of your medical care if you choose not to participate. You can also withdraw 
from the study at anytim e. 
 
1. INFORMATION ON THE RE SEARCH  
 Why is the research study being done?  
 
You have been scheduled for outpatient pelvic floor surgery. This research is being done to 
evaluate the timing of repeat voiding trials should the initial voiding trial in the reco very room be 
failed.  
 
What i s involved if you decide to take part in this research study?  
If you agree to take part in this study, your surgery will not be effected. During the surgery, 
all patients have a urinary catheter (Foley) inserted to drain the bla dder of urine. In the 
recove ry room, all patients have the catheter removed to see whether they can urinate on their 
own (voiding trial). If they can't urinate, a Foley is re -inserted.  
If you pass the recovery room voiding trial, you will not be randomized  to either of the 
treatment groups. Your data will continue to be collected and followed for research purposes.  
If you are unable to urinate in the recovery room, all patients go home with a Foley catheter 
and return for a repeat voiding trial in the offic e.  
 
Current practice is to wait 1 week before having the patient return for the office voiding trial. 
If you agree to partake in this study, you will be randomized on the day after surgery to either 
returning for an “early repeat voiding trial” in about 2 -4 days or returning for the  “normal 
 8 repeat voiding trial” after [ADDRESS_186973] a 50:[ADDRESS_186974].  
A description of this clinical trial will be available on http://www.Clinical Trials.gov, as 
required by U.S. Law. This website will not include information that can identify you.  At 
most, the Web site will include a summary of the results. You can search this at any time.  
 
2. ALTERNATIVES  
   What are the alternatives to participation in the research study?   
The alternative to participation in this study is to choose to not partic ipate in this study. If you 
do not participate you will undergo your scheduled surgery and follow up as per the normal 
routine.  
3. RISKS  
   What are the risks of participating in the research study?  
The procedures in this study are considered standard of care. Regardless of particip ation in 
this study, if one fails the recovery room voiding trial, they will be discharged home with a 
Foley catheter and antibiotics and will undergo an office voiding trial about one week after 
surgery. The only difference is that in this study you may b e randomized to the “early” 
group. If you are in the “early” group, there may be an increased risk of failing the voiding 
trial and having a catheter longer than you would otherwise. With a longer time with a 
catheter, there are  increased risks of discomfo rt and bacteriuria (bacteria in the urine). If 
untreated a bladder infection or kidney infection could result. Given the short interval of your 
follow up, the risks of the infection going untreated is low.   
Confidentiality risk s 
Data will be password prot ected and only accessible to the researches in the study 
medical staff involved in the procedure. The results of the urine tests/cultures will be a 
part of you medical record and these results can be obtained by [CONTACT_161072] a ccess 
to your medical record . 
 
     4. BENEFITS  
   What are possible benefits of participating in the research?  
You may not benefit directly from this research but results from this study may help counsel 
future patients on the best time to return for an o ffice void trial.  
 9 5. COSTS  
   Are there any costs to you if you participate in this study?  
All test and procedures are considered standard of care. You or your insurance company 
will be responsible for the cost of these test/procedures.  
 
You will be resp onsible for all co pays and deductibles for the visits.  
 
6. COMPENSATION

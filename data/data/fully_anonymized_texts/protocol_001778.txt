Brief Summary of Research (250-400 words): 
 
1) Objectives: 
Research Question: 
MAIN HYPOTHESES  
1. IVIM, DCE-MRI and MRE metrics can non invasively discriminate severe fibrosis/cirrhosis 
(F3-F4), from no fibrosis (F0) and intermediate fibrosis (F1-F2). To test our hypothesis, we 
will prospectively determine in a cohort of 100 subjects (including 80 with chronic liver 
disease and 20 controls) whether IVIM DW-MRI, DCE-MRI and MRE parameters are valid 
markers of liver fibrosis, using histopathology from liver biopsy or explant as the reference.  
2. MRI has equivalent performance to ultrasound elastography [including TE (transient 
elastography, Fibroscan) and ARFI (Acoustic Radiation Force Impulse imaging, Siemens) 
and serum markers for staging liver fibrosis, with the advantage of being more 
comprehensive and by [CONTACT_773144]. 
 
SECONDARY HYPOTHESES 
3. A blood pool contrast agent such as gadofoveset trisodium has better precision and 
accuracy in discriminating different degrees of liver fibrosis, compared to extra-cellular 
gadolinium agents such as Gd-BOPT.   
4. Arterial spin labeling (ASL) can provide perfusion metrics used to discriminate different 
degrees of liver fibrosis.  
5. There is a change in portal flow, hepatic perfusion fraction measured with IVIM DW-
MRI and in hepatic/splenic stiffness measured with MRE from fasting to non fasting 
state.

2) Background 
There is an expected increased incidence of chronic hepatitis C virus infection (HCV) in the 
Unites States within the next years, with subsequent increased risks of liver damage, including 
fibrosis and cirrhosis, which may eventually lead to hepatocellular carcinoma and end-stage liver 
disease requiring liver transplantation. This disease is/will be the source of enormous health care 
costs and morbidity/mortality.  Most hepatologists still rely on liver biopsy findings in patients 
newly diagnosed with HCV, which enables the assessment of liver damage (fibrosis and 
inflammation). Liver biopsy has limitations, including cost, invasiveness, poor patient 
acceptance, limited sampling, inter-observer variability and is difficult to repeat.  Non invasive 
tests to capture the extent of liver damage at a larger scale are urgently needed. These will gain 
more acceptance among patients and hepatologists. In this proposal, we would like to test and 
validate non invasive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods based on advanced diffusion 
(intravoxel incoherent motion diffusion MRI: IVIM DW-MRI) and dynamic contrast-enhanced 
MRI (DCE-MRI) for the detection of fibrosis and cirrhosis in HCV patients. Based on our recent 
preliminary data, we believe that the combination of IVIM DW- and DCE-MRI has potential for 
detection of fibrosis and cirrhosis with excellent accuracy, while enabling coverage of the whole 
liver. In order to improve the diagnostic performance of MRI, we would like to build and validate 
a predictive model based on advanced functional MRI metrics (diffusion and perfusion). If 
validated, this novel non invasive algorithm will not only decreases the number of liver biopsies, 
but also enable earlier diagnosis of liver fibrosis when antiviral treatment is more effective, and 
enable a comprehensive evaluation of the liver (to assess for cirrhosis, portal hypertension and 
hepatocellular cancer).  This could significantly reduce the cost of care, could become a useful 
tool for testing new antifibrogenic and antiviral drugs in HCV, and could be used to follow 
patients for detection of progression to cirrhosis. This will be a highly significant progress in liver 
diseases given the increased burden of HCV in this country, and would benefit a large number of 
Americans over the next decade.   
 
Purpose of study:  
 
1) Determine the prospective diagnostic performance of DW-MRI, DCE-MRI and MRE for 
staging liver fibrosis in patients with chronic liver disease in comparison to controls.   
 
2) Compare the diagnostic performance of MRI vs. transient elastography (TE) and acoustic 
radiation force impulse (ARFI) imaging and serum markers for non invasive detection of 
liver fibrosis in patients with chronic liver disease in comparison to controls.   
 
Secondary Objectives: 
 
1) Assess the role of a breath-hold/free-breathing phase contrast MR imaging sequence to assess 
portal vein and hepatic artery velocity and flow.  
2) Assess the role of hepatic and splenic stiffness measured with MRE as surrogate measures of 
portal hypertension (measured with portal pressures, which will be clinically indicated).

We have the equipment (MRI scanners, Fibroscan and ARFI) and we are in an open 
dialogue with the staff of Liver disease and liver transplant to be able to recruit the 
subjects needed to complete this study. 
 
5) Study Design 
a) Recruitment Methods 
Subjects with liver disease will be identified and recruited for the study by [CONTACT_773145]/or Liver Disease team. This selection will come from the 
physicians’ recommendation, which is familiar with their patient’s history. The referring 
physicians will not be considered co-investigators except [CONTACT_6033] and [CONTACT_773157]. [CONTACT_6036] and [CONTACT_773157] are both Co-investigators on this project. They will tell the other 
physicians in Liver Transplant and Liver Disease about the study and help to enroll patients.  
Other sources of potential subjects are the KCC ambulatory procedure list and the Mount 
Sinai Liver Transplant list provided by [CONTACT_773146]/Liver Disease Department. 
Subjects with liver disease who underwent liver biopsy at Mount Sinai will be identified by 
[INVESTIGATOR_124]. Fiel from the Pathology Department. [CONTACT_773158] is a Co-investigator on this study and 
provides the study team with a quarterly Pathology list.  
The treating physician will be the first to notify potential subjects about the study. If subjects 
consent to be contact[CONTACT_773147]. No potential subject will be contact[CONTACT_773148]’s prior consent. The study coordinator will review all listings and 
the patient’s medical records to check for their eligibility according to the inclusion/exclusion 
criteria and contraindications for MRI. A HIPAA waiver of authorization will be requested 
for the study. 
 
An announcement within the MSSM Broadcast emails will be used for recruitment.

Patients under medical treatment for portal hypertension or TIPS procedure are 
considered to be scheduled for visit 2 after they started their portal hypertension 
treatment or got TIPS placement to look at changes in hepatic flow and liver stiffness.  
 
Patients starting antiviral therapy for HCV will be evaluated before they start the therapy, 
and will be repeated 3 to 6 months after the end of therapy.  
 
We would like to perform the following sub-studies: All subjects will receive by [CONTACT_773150]-BOPTA (Multihance, Bracco) enhanced MRI (half dose at 0.05 mmol/Kg for the 
perfusion study) at 1.5T or 3T. In addition, the subjects may receive one of the following 
options: 
 
Option 1:  1.5T MRI using (Gadoxedate disodium (Eovist)) will be performed in up to 10 
subjects. 
o Sub-arm 1: In up to 5 subjects receiving Gadoxedate disodium (Eovist), the 
studies will be repeated twice at least 24h apart to measure reproducibility of 
DCE-MRI using Gadoxedate disodium (Eovist) 
 
Option 2:  3T MRI using Gd-BOPTA (same dose as above), will be performed in up to 
10 subjects. These could be different or same subjects as in option 1. 
MR Elastography: Will be performed in all patients before contrast injection, using a 1.5 
and/or 3T system (Siemens). The patient will be asked to perform multiple breath-holds 
during the image acquisition.    
 
Option 3:  Compare image quality and liver perfusion quantification between Cartesian 
and radial DCE-MRI acquisitions in a small subset of subjects (n=15), using the same 
contrast dose and MR system.  
 
The liver explant analysis will be performed as part of routine clinical care. In addition, the 
following will be assessed: degree of biliary differentiation (by [CONTACT_773151]-19 expression).  
 
Extra MRI sequences of the abdomen will be done for research. 
Fibroscan and/or ARFI to determine liver stiffness will be done for research. 
A blood test will be done to evaluate renal insufficiency, only if no recent EGFR value (not 
older than 6 weeks) is available in the medical record for contrast administration 
determination. 
A blood test will be done to evaluate liver serum markers for research purposes. 
A pregnancy test, if pregnancy cannot be excluded by [CONTACT_405388]-bearing potential, will 
be performed prior to any scan to determine eligibility for study participation.

h) Data Management and Confidentiality 
 
All research data will be stored separately from direct identifiers (e.g. name, address, DOB, 
MRN, SSN) that can link the data to a person's identity.  Research data files will be stored 
using a unique "code" instead.  The "linking code file" will be maintained separately in [CONTACT_773159]’s office. 
 
The file that links the code to the person's identity (direct identifiers) will be maintained 
electronically and in an encrypted file on a departmental network drive in Dr.Taouli’s office. 
 
All research data files will be stored electronically in encrypted files. Access to the data files 
will be through restricted view set up by [CONTACT_773152].  
The data will be stored for 7 years. 
 
i) Provisions to Monitor the Data to Ensure the Safety of subjects 
N/A Minimal risk 
j) Withdrawal of Subjects 
Subjects may withdraw at any time from the study with no penalty. This will not 
affect their ability to receive medical care. If a subject withdraws from the study, they 
must contact [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_75040]. The subject’s data may still be used after they have 
withdrawn authorization.  
The study doctor, the sponsor or the institution may stop the subject’s involvement in this 
study at any time without his/her consent. This may be because the study is being stopped, 
the instructions of the study team have not been followed, the investigator believes it is in the 
subject’s best interest, or for any other reason.  If specimens or data have been stored as part 
of the study, they too can be destroyed without the subject’s consent. 
 
6) Risks to Subjects 
 
Approximately two percent (2%) of participants experience some side effects with the use of 
gadolinium; however, they are mostly mild (nausea, headache, hives, temporary low blood 
pressure).

8) Potential Benefits to Subjects 
The subjects may not receive any direct benefit from participation in this research study. Others 
may not benefit either. However, possible benefits to others include decreasing the numbers of 
invasive biopsies, which will potentially enable earlier diagnosis of liver damage. 
 
9) Provisions to Protect the Privacy Interests of Subjects 
Every effort will be made by [CONTACT_773153], including subjects’ personal information, from 
the time participants are identified for recruitment until they complete study participation. 
This includes communication when scheduling appointments, leaving phone messages 
and follow-up contact. Records of participation, progress and images taken while on the 
study will be kept secure at Mount Sinai and in a computer file at the sponsor’s 
headquarters. All data sent to the sponsor over the internet will be coded.  
All efforts will be made to make the subjects feel at ease with the research situations. 
They will have the opportunity to ask questions and will have ample time to review and 
think about any questions, examinations and procedures in the study. Research 
procedures will be explained in simple, clear, concise language. Members of the research 
team will be appropriately able to approach prospective participants about the study 
because the potential subjects may be eligible for enrollment, their physicians have 
referred them for potential enrollment, and the research team is knowledgeable about 
study guidelines and protocol.

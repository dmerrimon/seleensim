Legume Diet Satiety and Weight Loss Pi[INVESTIGATOR_105629]  T erry Hartman PhD, MPH, RD  
05/19/[ADDRESS_806967] of US adults are overweight or 
obese (body mass index [BMI] >25 and >30 kg/m2, respectively) .1  It is well known that e xcess 
body weight is associated with increased risk for a number of chronic conditions including 
diabetes, heart disease , and some cancers  including colorectal cancer (CRC) .  
 Effective d ietary strategies are essential to address the issues of obesity and related 
metabolic disorders. Diet composition is one factor  that could influence dietary energy intake. 
For examp le, diets that are high in fiber require more chewing and a greater volume is consumed 
at a given energy intake (kcal/g) . These factors could lead to earlier termination of eating  and 
increased satiation. In addition, fiber -rich diets may impact physiologi cal mechanisms important 
for weight control including hormone release and gastric emptying .2,3  
  Epi[INVESTIGATOR_608709]2 and in some studies, with reduced risk for CRC  and the precursor lesions, adenomatous 
polyps .4 In previous research that targeted men at increased risk for CRC we observed that a 
high-legume diet provided under conditions of weight maintenance  favorably influenced 
biomarkers of inflammation, lipid levels, and gut hormone concentrations .5-9 In the same study, 
during a 4-week ancillary diet period where participants consumed the full legume diet entrée but 
with side dishes  ad libitum and were allowed to lose weight , the high -legume diet facilitate d 
weight loss .8  Participants consumed less total energy  (-770 kcal/d  below requirements for 
weight maintenance ), lost weight (-4.0 kg; -4.4%) and serum  lipid and gut hormone 
concentrations and biomarkers of insulin sensitivity  (plasma glucose: -5.7%; insulin: -15.8%; 
serum C-peptide: -17.4%)  and inflammation  (serum CRP: -20.2) all improved  significantly .  This 
sub-study  was conducted after an intensive [ADDRESS_806968] a feeding response time-course experiment or to explore other novel 
mechanisms through which l egumes may facilitate weight loss (e.g. appetite -regulating  
hormones, gastric emptying and transit time). In addition, the provision of all of the diet 
components may have played a role in controlling intake and promoting weight loss.   
 The goal of the  currently proposed study is to build upon our previous findings by 
[CONTACT_168486] a randomized controlled feeding pi[INVESTIGATOR_608710] a more diverse population  also at 
high risk for CRC  to evaluate whether a high-legume diet will result in increased satiety and in 
turn will facilitate  reduced energy intake and weight  loss compared to a control diet  provided 
under similar conditions .  In addition, we will explore potential beneficial effects of the high-
legume diet on gastric emptying  and circulating levels of  appetite -regulating hormones  and other 
biomarkers . Dietary behaviors  that are even  moderately more satiating  over time have the 
potential to enhance weight loss and could lead to  a significant  public health impact  among 
populations at high risk for CRC  and other chronic diseases .  
 
1.1. Study Objectives  
This pi[INVESTIGATOR_608711], comparing a legume -
rich diet and a control diet , on weight loss over the course of eight weeks. The primary outcome 
is weight loss. S econdary objectives will compare the effects of the two diets on total energy 
intake, biomarkers related to appetite regulation  and bl ood glucose control and  in exploratory 
3 
 analyses will assess  other aspects related to  weight loss (e.g., effects on gastroi ntestinal emptying 
and transit time  and on gut microbiota).  
 
1.1.1.   Primary Objectives  
1. Evaluate the effects of a high -legume diet compared to a control diet with a similar 
 macronutrient profile on weight loss in a randomized controlled feeding study  conducted 
 over eight weeks . 
 
1.1.2.   Secondary Objectives  
1. Assess whether the legume diet reduces  the average daily dietary energy intake of 
 participants  compared to a controlled diet .  
2. Compare satiety of the high -legume d iet to the control diet using self -reported satiety 
 questionnaires.  
3. Assess the effects of the two diet treatments on fasting levels of C -reactive protein  (CRP , a 
 marker of inflammation ) and total cholesterol level . 
4. Evaluate the effects of the aforementioned  diet treatments  on markers of appetite regulation 
 (cholecystokinin – CCK) and insulin resistance (insulin, glucose)  in a meal response time 
 course experiment .  
5. Compare the effects of the high -legume and control diets  on gastric emptying ti me and gut 
 transit time.  
6. Evaluate diet-related changes in fecal biomarkers associated with CRC risk.  
 
1.2. Background and Rationale  
1.2.1.   Scope of the problem  
Colorectal carcinoma (CRC) is the second  leading cause of cancer death in the U.S.[ADDRESS_806969] shown that obesity and body fatness are linked with recurrence 
for colorectal adenomas, particularly among me n.13  The influence of weight change, particularly 
weight loss, on risk factors  for CRC and adenomatous polyps has been examined in only 
relatively few studies.14,15 A three -year multicenter trial to prospectively address this question is 
in progress.16,17     
1.2.2.   Insulin resistance (IR) and colon cancer mechanisms  
Insulin resistance, the impairment to the biological response of insulin action, is characterized by 
[CONTACT_608721] -II diabetes  (DM) .[ADDRESS_806970] g rowth, development, and homeostasis of 
colonic cells .22,23 Recently, Komminou and colleagues reviewed the mechanistic associations 
between insulin resistance and CRC , as seen in Figure 1 .24 Inflammation and cytokine 
production such as TNF -α, are thought to promote insulin resistance ,23 increase IFG -1, and 
activate IкB kinase β (IKKβ), an upstream activator of NF -кB which leads to increased 
proliferation and decreased differentiation and apoptosis .24

1.2.3.  Inflammation, insulin resistance  and CRC  
C-reactive protein (CRP), an acute phase protein, is thought to be a sensitive and particularly 
stable marker for sub -clinical inflammation. Cytokines, mainly inter leukin -6 (IL -6) and tumor 
necrosis factor (TNF -α) may exert major stimulatory effects on the hepatic synthesis of acute -
phase proteins .[ADDRESS_806971] the development of insulin resistance26-30 and type-II 
diabetes .31-33.  Inflamm ation creates a microenvironment that encourages neoplastic 
transformations and potentiates the progression of cancer. In a recent cohort study34 plasma CRP 
concentrations were higher among CRC  cases than controls (median CRP, 2.44 vs. 1.94 mg/L; P 
=.01) and risk of CRC  was higher in persons in the highest quartile of CRP (OR= 2.55; 95% CI, 
1.34-4.88; P for trend =.002).  In our previous feeding study we demonstrated that CRP levels 
decreased by [CONTACT_46431] 20%  in response to a mean weight loss of 4.[ADDRESS_806972] a higher CRC incidence.  
 Intake of legumes provides benefits in reducing risk for diabetes and in diabetes 
management. Pulses (dry  beans)  are high in fiber and  have a very low glycemic index (GI)[ADDRESS_806973] been generally positive, though energy restriction appears 
necessary .2  
1.2.5.   Polyp Prevention Trial (PPT) Data  
The strongest dietary association in the PPT cohort was an inverse association between legume 
intake and advanced adenomas. Those in the highest quartile of average dry bean intake had a 

5 
 significant reduction in their odds ratio for recurrence of advanced polyps (OR=0.30 95% CI; 
0.15-0.60). For males, increased legume intake was also associated with a reduced odds ratio for 
any adenoma recurrence (OR=0.69 95% CI; 0.48 -0.99)4. The intervention arm, who consumed 
more legumes overall, also lost significantly more weight than the control arm ,42 supporting the 
hypothesis that a high fiber diet may help with weight management.  
1.2.6.  Satiety  
A high fiber diet increases the volume of food compared to the number of calories consumed  
(i.e., decreases energy density – ED kcal/g) , which creates a greater feeling of gastric fullness for 
fewer calories .43 Increased fiber content prolongs  the postprandial presence of intestinally 
derived lip oproteins and augments the release of cholecystokinin (CCK), a major gut peptide and 
a potent satiety signal involved  in meal termination .44. Several controlled feeding studies with 
high legume diets have shown increases in CCK .45,[ADDRESS_806974] whether a high -legume intervention will result in increased satiety and in turn  
will facilitate  reduced energy intake and weight  loss compared to a control diet provided under 
similar conditions . We will recruit men at increased risk for colorectal cancer (see below) at two 
locations (1) Emory University  ACTSI  and (2) The Morehouse School of Medicine Medical 
Clinical Research  Center  Bionutrition Core Center  (affiliated with the ACTSI) and surrounding 
areas.  Participants will be recruited  through targeted advertisements and (if approved) through 
targeted mailings  with the assistance of local gastroenterologists serving these  populations. 
These recruitment strategies were successfully used in our previous feeding trial which included  
65 high  risk men.   
2.1. Eligibility Criteria  
2.1.1.  Inclusion Criteria  
All subjects:  
1. 40-70 years old  
2. Male  
3. BMI overweight -obese: 25.0—40 kg/m2 
4. Colonoscopy within the last three years that found ≥1 adenoma  
5. English speaking  
6. Ambulatory, able to come to either food distribution site to pi[INVESTIGATOR_608712]  
6 
 2.1.2  Exclusion Criteria  
1. Serious medical condition (e.g., cancer, heart disease, kidney disease, diabetes)  
2. History of CRC , bowel resection, polyposis  syndrome, or inflammatory bowel disease  
3. Smoked regularly in the past year  
4. Dietary restrictions s ubstantially limiting compliance or vegetarian or Vegan diet  
5. Planning on changing diet or exercise behavior in the next 6 months  
6. Regular use of  medication that may alter inflammatio n markers, insulin, glucose, or gut 
function (i.e. regular use of non -steroidal anti -inflammator y medication, insulin therapy,  steroid 
therapy, or antibiotics)  
2.2.  Research Eligibility Evaluation  
We will conduct the sta ndard screening test s required by [CONTACT_608722] . A 
history and a physical will be performed by a clinician  for all participants at the Emory ACTSI 
site (PA or Nurse Practiti oner).   Participants should be in good health.  Use of medications to 
control blood pressure, blood lipi[INVESTIGATOR_608713] -related concerns is acceptable provided the 
participant is under a physician’s care and considered in good control and the medication will not 
interfere with outcome  measures.   
2.2.1.   Strategies to Recruit and Enroll Participants  
Subjects eligible according to a phone interview will be invited to one of the study sites. On this 
visit, after receiving informed consent, the participant’s heig ht, weight, and blood pressure will 
be checked. All eligible consented participants will be asked to visit the Emory ACTSI site to 
assess their resting metabolic rate (RMR) to be used to plan meals that will facilitate a weight 
loss of 1 -2 pounds per week  (energy deficit ~500 -1000 kcal/day) .  Once their individualized diet 
plan is developed participants will all undergo a one-week run -in of diet similar to the control 
diet.  The run -in helps to standardize conditions before the baseline biomarker collection  and 
provides some confidence in the participants’ ability to adhere to the study protocol.  
 
3.  STUDY IMPLEMENTATION  
 
Overall Study Design of Legume Pi[INVESTIGATOR_4238]  
 
 
3.1.1.  Timing of Biological Specimen Collection  
At randomization, after a one week run -in period, the baseline blood and fecal samples will be 
collected. These same specimens will be also collected at the end of the study period, after [ADDRESS_806975] set of legumes of the Phaseolus  vulgaris species, 
such as navy beans, pi[INVESTIGATOR_600050], and kidney beans in order to limit nutrient and phytochemical 
differences in the legume -intervention diet. The diet will contain approximately 2 50g of legumes 
per day ( ~1 ½ cups  cooked ) provided in two pr e-portioned single serving entrees  (i.e. ~125g 
each) . This level will add approximately [ADDRESS_806976] of two legume -enriched pre-portioned 
meal entrees per day with other meal components  being provided by [CONTACT_36801]. The 
control group will also receive two  pre-portioned  meal replacement entrees, with t he other meal 
components provided by [CONTACT_36801].  All entrees will be prepared, p re-portioned and 
frozen at the Morehouse site and transported to the Emory site as needed.  F rozen entrees will be 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_608714].  Weights will also be measured weekly at these visits. For both 
groups, guidance will be provided by [CONTACT_608723]-
selected to meet participants’ diet plans. Study personnel include three registered dietitians ( the 
PI, a Co-I, and an ACTSI RD ) to provide  dietary guidance  which will be supplemented with 
individualized written materials . During the first 1 -2 weeks of the participants’ diet treatment the 
study coordinator will contact [CONTACT_608724].  The consumption of ad libitum “sides” contributing to total energy intake 
is not controlled by [CONTACT_941] s tudy to enable us to evaluate the role of legumes in promoting satiety 
and control of  self-selected  total food intake.  
 
4. DATA COLLECTION AND EVALUTION  
4.[ADDRESS_806977] their body 
weight and height measured in light clothing without shoes on a regularly calibrat ed digital scale. 
Height will be measured in duplicate using a wall -mounted stadiometer . 
4.1.2  Body Composition  
Body composition will be assessed using dual energy X -ray absorptiometry (DXA) in the ACTSI 
at Emory University . This method uses a whole -body s canner to measure total body composition 
and fat content with a high degree of precision . It is safe and noninvasive with little burden to the 
individual. Data from the DXA scans will be used to assess longitudinal changes in body fat that 
accompany weight  loss. This data will also allow examination of changes in fat distribution at 
defined regions in the body.  
4.1.3.  24 Hour Diet Recall  
Subjects will be asked by a trained study staff member to recall their food  and beverage  intake  
during the previous 24 hour period or the preceding day. During the week prior to 
randomization, two unannounced telephone 24 hour recall interviews will be conducted, one 
during a weekday and one on a weekend. This will be repeated again during the second  week 
after randomization, and again during the 7th week of randomization. The interview will follow a 
four-stage, multiple -pass interview technique and be conducted over the phone  using Nutrient 
Data Systems for Research ( NDSR ), the state of the art diet assessment  and nutrient analysis  
[ADDRESS_806978] meal (fasting),  and 10 ml of blood  at 5 time points thereafter ( 30, 60, 90, 120, and 
180 minutes).  Serum and plasma samples will be aliquoted in smaller vials and frozen at –70°C 
and stored for analysis at the completion of the study .  
4.1.6.  Blood Analyses  
Approximately seventy  microliter s of serum will be used to measure insulin, glucose, total 
cholesterol , CCK  and CRP using standard techniques.  
4.1.7.  Gastric Motility  
The WMC system (SmartPi[INVESTIGATOR_608715], Buffalo, NY) consists of an indigestible single -use 
capsule, a receiver, and display software (MotiliGI, SmartPi[INVESTIGATOR_608716]) recommended for the 
assessment of gastric emptying and gut transit time. Also included are assessments of pH, 
temp erature and pressure through the GI tract.  This series of studies will be conducted under the 
direction of gastroenterologist and co -investigator [CONTACT_608728] , Emory Univer sity.  
 After an overnight fast a representative study meal is consumed an d immediately thereafter 
the participa nt swallows the SmartPi[INVESTIGATOR_608717] e with an additional [ADDRESS_806979] GI motility.  The data receiver and diary are returned after 5 
days for analysis .  Gastric emptying time , small bowel as well as colonic transit time  can be 
estimated by [CONTACT_608725], pressure, and temperature. F or example, the 
movement of the capsule from the stomach to the duodenum  results in a pH rises of  >3.[ADDRESS_806980]  
Breath  hydrogen tests will determine the a mount of hydrogen ( H2) and methane ( CH 4) present in 
expi[INVESTIGATOR_608718] a known volume of carbohydrate.  T he type of gas in 
expi[INVESTIGATOR_608719].  Collection of a timed 
response will allow future calculation and determination of the amount of unabsorbed 
9 
 carbohydrate in a meal through gut response measures. Breath hydroge n tests will be conducted 
at the same time as the time course experiments (insulin, glucose, CCK)  and during the first day 
of the SmartPi[INVESTIGATOR_559079] .  Collections are done at 30, 60, 90, 120, and [ADDRESS_806981] 
the stool. Two separate   ̴5 g samples will be taken for fecal microbiome analyses. All samples 
will be transported to the laboratory, coded by [CONTACT_349012], and held at –80° C  for 
future microbiome analysis . 
4.2. Statistical Considerations  
The main endpoint of interest in this study is weight loss. There are several proposed 
mechanisms by [CONTACT_608726], many of which have not been 
tested in a controlled setting. Due  to new technology, we are now able to examine one of these 
proposed mechanisms —colon transit time, allowing us to directly observe a legume diet’s 
physiologic effect. Previous studies of legume -heavy diets have shown indications that the 
particular type o f fiber specific to legumes may increase satiety and slow gastric emptying 
significantly, leading patients to consume fewer calories per day, thereby [CONTACT_608727].   Thus, we do expect to have di fferences in 
energy intake between groups. The analyses will follow the intent -to-treat principle. BMI will 
certainly be considered as a possible confounder. Since this is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_4251], doing so will be 
important to determine the appropriate target popula tion for a full -scale trial and whether 
randomization in that protocol should be stratified by [CONTACT_44207]. Secondary outcomes, including both 
the satiety hormones and glucose are expected to rise quickly in response to the test meal and 
then decline over the cour se of the next few hours as gastric emptying occurs.  
 In the Legume Inflammation Feeding Experiment full -feeding study, participants averaged -
3.9 ± 0.4kg over the course of four weeks8. Ten participants (five individuals per treatment arm) 
would be sufficient  to detect a difference of just 1.25kg (we expect > 1 kg) in weight loss, with 
80% power, assuming a standard deviation for each groups’ weight loss that is slightly higher 
(±0.7kg) than seen in our prior study8. To account for the potential small dropout rate , we will 
recruit a total of 14 patients (7 per treatment arm). There are multiple secondary outcomes that 
we are interested in determining the appropriate sample size for when we run a full -scale study. 
Some of these outcomes are novel, so we are explorin g the feasibility of pursuing them in a full 
scale study.  
 Within -subject changes in end -points will be compared by [CONTACT_54959] t -test; comparisons 
between treatment groups by [CONTACT_1192] -sample t -tests.  For the time course experiments, because of the 
large expected i ndividual variations in fasting levels of metabolic and appetite hormones, we 
intend to compute the change from baseline at each time point for each individual for all of the 
variables and subsequently comparing the area under the curve results55. All data will be 
presented as means + SEM; the probability level at which differences will be considered 
significant will be P<0.05.  All analyses will be perfor med using the most recent version of SAS 
(SAS Institute, Cary, NC).

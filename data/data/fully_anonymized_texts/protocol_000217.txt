Concept and 
Scientific 
Rationale  Pancreatic Cancer  
In 2018, it is estimated that 55,440 new cases of pancreatic ductal 
adenocarcinoma (PDAC) will be diagnosed and 44,[ADDRESS_767687] a potentially curative surgical resection. For the 10 -20% of patients who a re 
able to undergo a surgical resection, outcomes are still relatively poor. The optimal 
treatment strategy for resectable  pancreatic cancer remains under investiga tion. 
Subsets of patients with resectable  disease appear to benefit from neoadjuvant 
therapy ; however , many patients with resectable disease will receive upfront 
surgery. Although  distant recurrence predominates after resection, up to 30% of 
patients have only local disease as the first site of recurrence.3,[ADDRESS_767688] historically 
involved either single -agent gemcitabine (GEM) or 5 -fluorouracil (5 -FU) with 
leucovorin  (LV). Both  agents had similar median overall survival (mOS) when 
compared head -to-head in the ESPAC -3 trial (23.6 months with GEM and 23.0 
months with 5 -FU, P = 0.39), with GEM favored due to a better toxicity profile.5 The 
ESPAC -4 trial changed the adjuvant treatment paradigm, demonstrating that GEM 
plus capecitabine (CAPE, oral 5 -FU) had a longer mOS than GEM alone (28.0 vs. 
25.5 months, P = 0.032).[ADDRESS_767689] of 
care for fit patients, demonstrating that mFOLFIRINOX ( FFX: LV, 5-FU, irinotec an, 
and oxaliplatin) was superior to GEM in terms of mOS (54.4 vs. 35.0 months, P = 
0.003).[ADDRESS_767690] adjuvant regimen for fit patients. There is 
also an ongoing trial of GEM/nab -paclitaxel vs. GEM as an adjuvant treatment 
option.8 
 
Adjuvant Chemoradiation  
Chemoradiation typi[INVESTIGATOR_210588] 5 -FU or CAP E administered concurrently with 
radiation. The ESPAC -1 study suggested that patients who received 
chemoradiation had inferior mOS (13.9 months) compared to patients who 
received chemotherapy alone (21.6 months), chemoradiation followed by 
[CONTACT_11553] (19 .9 months), or observation alone (16.9 months), although the 
[ADDRESS_767691] tha t upfront administration of adjuvant systemic chemotherapy is 
paramount over other treatment m odalities . The results of the RTOG 0848 trial will 
hopefully elucidate the role of adjuvant chemoradiation timed at the end of 
adjuvant chemotherapy.10 In the RTOG 0848 trial, patients with no evidence of 
disease rec urrence after 5 cycles of adjuvant GEM are randomized to 1 more cycle 
of GEM or chemoradiation with 5 -FU or CAPE.  
 
Proton Therapy and Targeted Radiation Therapy  for Pancreatic C ancer  
Proton -based radiotherapy (PRT) is an exciting novel treatment option fo r the 
treatment of PDAC. Conventional radiation therapy techniques typi[INVESTIGATOR_1435] 25 
to 28 fractions delivered over 5 to 6 weeks. However, because of the precision of 
proton therapy, it is feasible to complete treatment using a short course of only 5 
sessions. Prior work has shown that concomitant CAPE and PRT is associated 
with a low rate of gastrointestinal toxicity.11 In a phase I/II study, Hong and 
colleagues demonstrated the safety of short -course proton -based chemoradiation 
with CAPE in the neoadjuvant s etting for patients with resectable PDAC.12 The 
recommended phase II do se was 5 daily doses of 5 GyE. The MGH group 
attempted to deliver the same 5 fraction treatment using IMRT, however the 
toxicities were unacceptable.13 For resected  PDAC, photon -based stereotactic 
body radiation therapy delivered in 5 fractions (33 Gy) can be safely integrated 
with FFX chemotherapy in the adjuvant setting.14 Nichols and colleagues 
compared treatment plans using protons to conventional photon intensity -
modulation radiotherapy (IMRT) and found that proton -based postoperative 
chemoradiation decreases off -target small bowel and stomach exposure.15 Thus, 
proton -based chemoradiation should cau se fewer acute and long -term toxicities 
than conventional photon -based IMRT. Additionally, we hypothesize that delivery 
of radiation therapy earlier after resection (as opposed to following the completion 
of adjuvant chemotherapy) will increase its effecti veness while not disrupting 
adjuvant  chemotherapy .  Therefore, we propose a phaseI  study to assess the 
safety and feasibility of short -course PRT with adjuvant FFX.

In this study , we utilize 5 fraction PRT, delivered over 1 week, during adjuvant FFX 
(between cycles 6 and 7) to minimize the interruptions in chemotherapy as well as 
to reduce the length of time  from surgical resection to initiating adjuvant radiation 
therapy. Conventional radiation therapy is typi[INVESTIGATOR_583830] [ADDRESS_767693] of mFOLFIRINOX in  14-day cycles x 12 as used in the

Statistical 
Design,  
Feasibility, and 
Trial Duration  This study will use a 3+3 dose -escalation design to determine the safety and 
feasibility of combining 5 fraction adjuvant PRT with FFX. While there is limited 
literature on the combination of short course PRT and F FX, there are analogous 
experiences using 5 fraction SBRT or IMRT following FFX in routine clinical 
practice. The ongoing Alliance 021501 trial of preoperative chemotherapy vs. 
chemotherapy plus radiation (IMRT using 5 Gy X 5 or SBRT 6.6 X 5) in borderline 
resectable  pancreatic cancer mandates that radiation starts [ADDRESS_767694] at LCC C. Approximately 30 new patients 
with resected PDAC are seen annually at LCCC. We hypothesi ze that 24 patients 
will be eligible annually and 50% of these patients will enroll in the trial  (12 
evaluable patients maximum).

1.1 Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC)  
 
In 2018, it is estimated that 55,440 new cases of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) will 
be diagnosed and 44,[ADDRESS_767695] a potentially curative surgical resection. For the 10 -20% of patients who are able to

adjuvant regimen for fit patients. There is also an ongoing trial of GEM/nab -paclitaxel vs. GEM 
as an adjuvant treatment option.8 
 
1.3 Adjuvant Chemoradiation  
 
Chemoradiation typi[INVESTIGATOR_210588] 5 -FU or CAPE administered concurrently with radiation. 
The ESPAC -1 study suggested that patients who received chemoradiation had inferior mOS 
(13.9 months) compared to patients who received chemotherapy alone (21.6 mont hs), 
chemoradiation followed by [CONTACT_11553] (19.9 months), or observation alone (16.9 months), 
although the study was not adequately powered to compare the [ADDRESS_767699] that upfront administration of adjuvant systemic chemotherapy is paramount 
over other treatment modalities. The results of the RTOG 0848 trial will hopefully elucidate the 
role of adjuvant chemoradiation timed at the end of adjuvant chemotherapy.10 In the RTOG 
0848 trial, patients with no evidence of disease recurrence after 5 cycles of adjuvant GEM are 
randomized to 1 mor e cycle of GEM or chemoradiation with 5 -FU or CAPE.  
 
1.4 Proton Therapy and Targeted Radiation Therapy for Pancreatic Cancer  
 
Proton -based radiotherapy (PRT) is an exciting novel treatment option for the treatment of 
PDAC. Conventional radiation therapy techniques typi[INVESTIGATOR_1435] 25 to 28 fractions delivered 
over 5 to 6 weeks. However, because of the precision of proton therapy, it is feasible to 
complete tre atment using a short course of only 5 sessions. Prior work has shown that 
concomitant CAPE and PRT is associated with a low rate of gastrointestinal toxicity.11 In a 
phase I/II study, Hong and colleagues demonstrated the safety of short -cours e proton -based 
14 
Version 1.0, September 6, 2018  chemoradiation with CAPE in the neoadjuvant setting for patients with resectable PDAC.12 The 
recommended phase II dose was 5 daily doses of 5 GyE. The MGH group attempted to deliver 
the same 5 fraction treatment using IMRT, however the toxicities were unacceptable .13.For 
resected PDAC, photon -based stereotactic body radiation therapy delivered in 5 fractions (33 
Gy) can be safely integrated with FFX chemotherapy in the adjuvant setting.14 Nichols and 
colleagues compared treatment plans using protons to conventional photon intensity -modulation 
radiotherapy (IMRT) and found that proton -based postoperative chemoradiation decreases off -
target small bowel and stomach exposure.15 Thus, proton -based chemoradiation should cause 
fewer acute and long -term toxicities than conventional photon -based IMRT. Additionally, we 
hypothesize that delivery of radiation therapy earlier after resection (as opposed to following the 
completion of adj uvant chemotherapy) will increase its effectiveness while not disrupting 
adjuvant  chemotherapy .  Although selected patients with borderline resectable and locally 
advanced PDAC undergo neoadjuvant therapy, the majority of patients with resectable disease 
in the US still receive surgery upfront. Therefore, we propose a phase  I study to assess the 
safety and feasibility of short -course PRT with adjuvant FFX. 
 
1.5 Fluorouracil and Leucovorin  
Fluorouracil (5-FU) has been the backbone of chemotherapy regimens for ga strointestinal 
malignancies dating back to the 1950s.  5-FU is FDA -approved for use in colorectal, breast, 
gastric, and PDAC .18 
 
Figure 2. Chemical Structure of Fluorouracil  
 
 
 
 
5-FU is a nucleoside metabolic inhibitor that is converted to FdUMP which inhibits thymidylate 
synthase  (TS), disrupting DNA synthesis. Leucovorin (folinic acid) stabilizes the ternary complex 
of FdUMP, TS, and tetrahydrofolate, further potentiating TS inhibition .[ADDRESS_767700] be permanently discontinued in patients with early onset or unusually severe toxicity 
which may indicate complete or near absence of dipyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) activity. 
Fluorouracil carries a risk of cardioto xicity, hyperammonemic encephalopathy, neurologic 
toxicity, diarrhea, palmar -plantar erythrodyesthesia  (hand -foot syndrome), myelosuppression, 
mucositis, increased risk of INR with warfarin, and embryofetal toxicity.  
 
1.6 Oxaliplatin  
 
Oxaliplatin is a platinum -based chemotherapy agent that induces inter - and intra -strand DNA 
crosslinking, halting DNA synthesis. It is FDA -approved20 in combination with infusional 5 -FU 
and LV for the management of adjuvant stage III colon cancer based on the MOSAIC trial,21 and 
for the treatment of advanced colorectal cancer.  22 Oxaliplatin carries risks of allergic reactions, 
neuropathy, pulmonary toxicity, hepatotoxicity, and cytopenias .20

Version 1.0, September 6, 2018   
 
 
1.7 Irinotecan  
 
The active metabolite of irinotecan (SN -38) is a potent topoisomerase I inhibitor that induces 
DNA damage and cell death (see section [IP_ADDRESS] ). Irinotecan is FDA -approved for the first -line 
treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) and for treatment  of mCRC following 
progression on or recurrence following 5 -FU-based therapy.23 Saltz and colleagues 
demonstrated that the addition of irinotecan 125 mg/m2 IV in combination with 5 -FU 425 mg/m2 
IV bolus and LV 20 mg/m2 given weekly for 4 weeks every 6 weeks (IFL regimen) was superior 
to 5-FU and LV at the same doses given daily days 1 -5 every 4 weeks in patient with mCRC.24 
André and colleagues also demonstrated the efficacy of bolus 5 -FU 400 mg/m2 IV, LV 400 
mg/m2 IV, irinotecan 180 mg/m2 IV, and infusional 5 -FU 2400 mg/m2 IV over 46 hours every 2 
weeks (FOLFIRI regimen).25 Fuchs and colleagues later showed that irinotecan, LV, and 
infusional 5 -FU (FOLFIRI) was superior to irinotecan, LV, and bolus 5 -FU (IFL), both with and 
without bevacizumab.[ADDRESS_767701] 11 trial established FFX  (non-modified: LV 400 mg/m2, 5-FU 400 
mg/m2 bolus, 5 -FU 2400 mg/m2 infusion, irinotecan 180 mg/m2, and oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2, every 
2 weeks)  as a standard -of-care for patients with advanced PDAC.28 Patients were randomized 
1:1 to FFX or GEM . Patients who received FFX had superior mOS (11.1 vs. 6.8 months; HR 
0.57, 95% CI 0.45 -0.73; P < 0.001) at the expense of more grade 3 or higher toxicities  
(neutropenia 46% vs. 21%, febrile neutropenia 5% vs. 1%, diarrhea 13% vs . 2%, sensory 
neuropathy 9%  vs. 0%), although there was a quality of life benefit from FFX.

2.1 Primary Objective:  
To determine the recommended phase II dose and schedule (RP2D) of short -course PRT 
integrated within adjuvant FFX (radiation 12 days following chemotherapy or 5 days following 
chemotherapy) for resected PDAC. The co -primary objectives are to demonstrate th e safety and 

16 
Version 1.0, September 6, 2018  feasibility of short short -course proton radiation within systemic adjuvant chemotherapy with 
FFX, including the number of cycles received and relative chemotherapy dose -intensity.  
 
2.2 Exploratory Objectives:  
 
To determine, in patients with resected PDAC undergoing PRT integrated within adjuvant FFX:

appropriate, including transfusion of blood and blood products, oxygen therapy, nutritional 
support, intravenous fluids, and treatment with appropriate medica tions (antibiotics, antiemetics, 
antidiarrheals, and analgesics, etc.).  Medications, including steroids, which are given for 
supportive care, such as appetite stimulation, may be given concurrently.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Bisphosphonates and denosumab  
Bisphosphonates  and denosumab are permitted for the treatment of osteoporosis . Chronic 
concomitant bisphosphonate/denosumab therapy for the prevention of bone metastasis is not 
permitted.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Hematopoietic growth factors  
Hematopoietic growth factors may be used acco rding to ASCO guidelines.  Pegfilgrastim is 
recommended as outlined in Section 5.0.  
 
[ADDRESS_767711] completed 2 cycles of FFX for resected pancreatic adenocarcinom a of the head of the 
pancreas will be eligible for enrollment. PRT will occur between cycles 6 and 7.  
In dose level 1 (DL1), patients will complete cycle 6 chemotherapy (days 1 -3) and then receive 
5 days of daily 5 GyE proton therapy on days 15 -19 (exclud ing weekend days) in a 28 day cycle, 
prior to starting cycle 7 (see Figure 1). In DL2, patients will complete cycle 6 chemotherapy 
(days 1 -3) and then receive 5 days of daily 5 GyE proton therapy on days 8 -12 (excluding 
weekend days) in a 21 day cycle, pri or to starting cycle 7. A 3+3 dose -escalation schema will be 
used, requiring 3 -12 patients to be enrolled.  
 
Using a 3+3 dose -escalation design, if 0 of 3 patients experience a dose -limiting toxicity (DLT) 
at DL1, then 3 patients will then be enrolled in DL 2. If 1 of 3 patients experiences a DLT at DL1, 
then 3 additional patients will be enrolled at DL1. If 2 -3 of 3 patients experience a DLT at DL1, 
then the study is terminated. If 1 of 6 patients experiences a DLT at DL1, then 3 patients will be 
enrolled at  DL2. If 0 -1 of 3 patients experiences a DLT at DL2, then 3 additional patients will be 
enrolled at DL2. If 2 -3 patients experience a DLT at DL2, treatment will continue at DL1 until 6 
patients are enrolled at DL1. If 0 -1 of 6 patients experiences a DLT at  DL2, then DL2 is the 
recommended phase 2 dose and schedule (RP2D). Conversely, if 0 -1 of 6 patients experiences 
a DLT at DL1 AND 2 or greater patients experience a DLT at DL2, then DL1 is the RP2D.  
All cycles will be 14 days, except cycle 6 which is exte nded to 28 days in DL1, including the 5 
daily doses of PRT on days  15-19 (excluding weekend days), and 21 days in DL2, including the 
5 daily doses of PRT on days 8 -12 (excluding weekend days, see Figure 1 below).  
 
If a scheduled PRT dose falls on a weekend  or holiday, then the next daily dose falls on the next 
business day. The [ADDRESS_767712] possible time interval (e.g. 
7 days total if 2 are weekend days).

Study activities are detailed in Table s 2 (DL1) and 3 (DL2) , and a study activity checklist in 
Table 4. Screening will occur within [ADDRESS_767713] ’s legally acceptable representative 
before any study -specific procedures are undertaken.  For procedures performed at screening 
and repeated, the later procedure performed prior to dosing, will serve as a baseline for clinical 
assessment.  A complete history and physical will be obtained at the screening visit.  
Additionally, labs will be reviewed/ordered during the screening visit, prior to the ini tiation of 
therapy.   
 
Patients who pass screening will undergo PRT planning and a full evaluation on Cycle [ADDRESS_767714] ’s legally acceptable 
representative before any study -specific procedures are undertaken.

[IP_ADDRESS] Pregnancy Test  
For female subjects of childbearing potential, a seru m pregnancy test will be performed at the 
screening visit within [ADDRESS_767715] -menopausal (for at least 1 year).  The test results 
must be reviewed and determined to be negative prior to dosing. If the urine pregnancy test is 
positive at C 6D1, it should be confirmed by a serum pregnancy test. The test may be repeated 
at the discretion of the investigator at any time during the study.  Should a female study subject 
become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform 
the treating Investigator immediately.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Tumor assessment

onto the study . Patients with suspected disease recurrence will have to be evaluated to rule out 
disease recurrence prior to study enrollment.  
 
4.3 Patient Study Number Assignment and Sample Labeling  
 
4.3.1 .1 Patient Study Number Assignment  
Patient s will be de -identified and assigned  with a 3-digit study label ( XXX).  
 
4.[ADDRESS_767716] assessments (physical examinations, vital signs, performance status, chemistry, 
hematology, medication review, and adverse event evaluations) will be conducted at screening, 
C6D1, C6D15 (DL1) or C6D8 (DL2), and D1 of every subsequent cycle (every 14 days ± 3 
days) . Details are provided in Table s [ADDRESS_767717] during screening ( prior to C6D1) , during PRT, and at follow -up 
visits as outlined below.   
 
4.4.1 Physical Examinations  
A complete physical examination will be performed at the screening visit, on C6D1, C6D15 (DL1) 
or C6D8 (DL2), and D1 of every subsequent cycle (every 14 days ± 3 days) . Any significant 
physical examination findings after the administration of the first dose s PRT will be recorded as 
adverse events.  Body weight will be recorded during every physical exam. The subject will 
wear lightweight clothing and no sh oes during weighing.  Weight will be measured on the same 
scale at each visit. Height will be measured at the screening visit  and C6D1  only; the subject will 
not wear shoes.  
 
4.4.[ADDRESS_767718] ’s medical history will be reviewed and any changes from baseline will 
be recorded as an adverse event.  On C6D1, any changes observed from the screening 
assessments, prior to dosing, will be recorded in the subject ’s medical history. All medications 
(prescription or over -the-counte r, including vitamins and/or herbal supplements) will be recorded 
beginning with the screening visit and continuing up through the date of the final visit.  
 
4.4.3  Vital Signs  
24 
Version 1.0, September 6, 2018  Vital sign determinations of body temperature (in degrees Celsius) , heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], 
blood pressure and pain (using a 0- 10 Numeric Ranking Scale) will be obtained at the screening 
visit, on each day the subject is seen by [CONTACT_1963], and at the final visit. If possible, 
blood pressure and heart rate measurements should not immediately follow scheduled blood 
collections. 
 
4.4.4 Clinical Laboratory Tests 
All subjects will undergo the laboratory assessments outlined in Tables 2 and 3.  
1) A complete blood count (CBC) with differential will be collected at the screening visit, on 
C6D1, C6D15 (DL1) or C6D8 (DL2), and D1 of every subsequent cycle (every 14 days ± 
3 days). 
2) Serum chemistries (total protein, albumin, total bilirubin, AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase, 
sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, BUN, creatinine, and calcium) will be collected 
at the screening visit, on C6D1, C6D15 (DL1) or C6D8 (DL2), and D1 of every 
subsequent cycle (every 14 days ± 3 days). 
3) PT/INR and aPTT will be collected at the screening visit (this may be repeated during 
the course of the study at the discretion of the investigator but is not required). 
 
Laboratory samples for this study will be assessed using the certified laboratory at the 
investigators’ institutions, or at a clinical laboratory such as Quest or LabCorp  and these data 
will be used for all data analysis.  The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_11637]-investigator will review, initial 
and date all laboratory results. Any laboratory value outside the reference range that is 
considered clinically significant by [CONTACT_94499]. Clinically 
significant laboratory values will be recorded as adverse events if they meet the criteria as 
specified in Section 6.0. 
 
4.4.5 Adverse Event Evaluation 
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_11637]-investigators will assess adverse events, laboratory data and 
vital signs throughout the study.  Adverse events will be assessed by [CONTACT_137773] 5.0. 
https://ctep.cancer.gov/protocoldevelopment/electronic_applications/docs/CTCAE_v5_Quick_R
eference_5x7.pdf. The investigators will monitor each subject for clinical and laboratory 
evidence of adverse events on a routine basis throughout the study. The investigator will assess 
and record any adverse event in detail including the date of onset, event diagnosis (if known) or 
sign/symptom, severity, time course, duration and outcome, relationship of the adverse event to 
study drug, and any action(s) taken. For serious adverse events not considered “probably 
related”  to study drug, the investigator will provide an “Other ” cause of the event. For adverse 
events to be considered intermittent, the events must be of similar nature and severity. Adverse 
events, whether in response to a query, observed by [CONTACT_8786], or reported spontaneously 
by [CONTACT_41614]. All adverse events will be followed to a satisfactory conclusion. 
 
4.4.[ADDRESS_767719] (unless medically contraindica ed). If a patient has an allergy to IV 
contrast, appropriate pre-medication can be given to prevent a contrast reaction. Patients may 
undergo other modalities such as an MRI instead of a CT scan at the treating physician’s 
discretion if appropriate (such as severe allergy to CT contrast, extremity tumors, bone 
metastases requiring bone scans, etc.).   
 
The first follow-up surveillance scan will occur within 14 days of the End of Treatment (EOT) 
visit which will be scheduled following completion of C12 or the last cycle of FFX administered. 
Follow-up visits including scans (CT or MRI) and blood work including CA19-[ADDRESS_767720] will be withdrawn from the study if any of the 
following occur:  
1) The subject experiences either clinical or radiographic progressive d isease.  
2) The subject requires other radiotherapy or alternate antineoplastic agents during the 
study period.  
3) The investigator believes it is in the best interest of the subject.  
4) Clinically significant deterioration of the subject ’s medical status as determ ined by [CONTACT_1275].  
5) Subject becomes pregnant or begins breastfeeding during the treatment portion of the 
study.  
6) The subject or subject ’s legally acceptable representative decides to withdraw consent 
for any reason.  
7) Any other medical reason that the study investigator deems appropriate.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Discontinuation of Individual Subjects  
When a subject discontinuation from the study (without reaching a protocol -defined endpoint) is 
planned, the investigator will notify the PI [INVESTIGATOR_91394] (provide d, in each case, subject 
care and safety are not compromised).  When a subject discontinues the study, a final visit will 
be conducted (preferably prior to the initiation of another anticancer therapy). However, these 
procedures should not interfere with t he initiation of any new treatments or therapeutic 
modalities that the investigator feels are necessary to treat the subject ’s condition. Following 
discontinuation of the study drug, the subject will be treated in accordance with the 
investigator ’s best cl inical judgment.  At the final visit, the reason(s) for the discontinuation from 
the study will be recorded and a physical examination, body weight, vital signs measurement, 
laboratory analyses, performance status, tumor assessment, and an assessment of ad verse 
events will be performed as soon as possible after discontinuation from the study.  All subjects 
will have one final visit, which does not need to be performed for subjects who have had a visit 
greater than [ADDRESS_767721] be discontinued immediately.   
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Discontinuation of Entire Study  
The investigators may terminate this study provided that written notice is submitted at a 
reasonable time in advance of the intended termination.  The following procedures for 
discontinuation will be followed:  
1) If the investigators have decided to prematurely  discontinue the study, the investigators 
will promptly notify in writing the IRB of the decision and give detailed reasons for the 
discontinuation.  
2) The PI [INVESTIGATOR_583833] t reatments such as replacement of protocol therapy by [CONTACT_583841].

Version 1.0, September 6, 2018  5.0 DOSAGES AND DISPE NSATION OF DRUGS    
5.1 FFX Administration  
The study drugs are defined as 5-FU, LV, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan (FFX) . Due to the infusional 
5-FU, study drugs must be administered via central line (mediport, PI[INVESTIGATOR_6875], or other).  Treatment 
cycles are every 14 days ± 3 days  (except for C6 which is 28 day s in DL1 and 21 days in DL2) . 
The study drug dosages and administration are only recommended – dosages and supportive 
medication can be modified at the discretion of the investigator, taking into consideration dose 
modifications during cycles 1 -5. Per the PRODIGE 24 trial, the 5 -FU bolus is omitted and 
irinotecan is 150 mg/m2. A research infusion nurse will access the patient’s line. Treatment will 
then be administered in the following order (substitutions  for prophylactic medications are 
allowed at the tre ating investigator’s discretion):  
Table 5. Drug Administration  
Drug  Indication  Dose/Route  Duration  
Fosaprepi[INVESTIGATOR_583834]  150 mg IV  30 minutes  
Ondansetron  Nausea prophylaxis  16 mg IV  15 minutes  
Dexamethasone  Nausea prophylaxis  10 mg IV  15 minutes  
Leucovorin  Treatment  400 mg/m2 IV 60 minutes  
Oxaliplatin  Treatment  85 mg/m2 IV 120 minutes (can be administered 
simultaneously with leucovorin via 
a Y-connector)  
Atropi[INVESTIGATOR_583835]  0.5 mg IV  IV push  
Irinotecan  Treatment  150 mg/m2 IV 90 minutes  
5-fluorouracil  Treatment  2400 mg/m2 IV 46 hours (continuous infusion)  
Pegfilgrastim on -
pro Growth factor 
support  6 mg SC  Administered on day 3 (after 5 -
fluorouracil pump is unhooked)  
 
The patient will return to the research infusion clinic after [ADDRESS_767726] ion of the 5 -FU 
infusional pump and administration of pegfilgrastim on -pro. Use of growth factor support is 
highly recommended but is at the discretion of the investigator. Alternatively, pegfilgrastrim 6 mg 
SC can be administe red on day 4 (if not using on -pro administration).  
 
5.2 Packaging , Labeling , Storage, and Handling  of Chemotherapy  
5-FU, LV, oxaliplatin,and  irinotecan should be stored and handled as per their respective FDA 
labels and following protocols and guidelines of LCCC (see  
http://www.osha.gov/SLTC/hazardousdrugs/index.html).18-20,[ADDRESS_767727] at risk nodal regions: celia c, SMA, 
and para -aortic regions . The porta hepatic  nodes have been shown to be at significantly less 
risk for local recurrence and will not be included in the treatment .29,30 The no rmal tissue 
constraints are as follows: stomach and small bowel: V30 < 0.1 cc, V20  < 5 cc, V15  < [ADDRESS_767728] D max < 25 Gy, liver V17 < 33%. Target volume coverage should be greater than 95%. Two 
posterior oblique beams or [ADDRESS_767729] adjuvant mFOLFIRINOX 
for remainder of treatment.

Version 1.0, September 6, 2018  6.0 SAFETY VARIABLES AND TOXICITY ASSESSM ENT  
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_11637]-investigators will assess adverse events, laboratory data and 
vital signs throughout the study.  Adverse events will be assessed by [CONTACT_137773] 5.0: 
https://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/docs/CTCAE_v5_Quick_R
eference_8.5x11.pdf . 
 
6.[ADDRESS_767730] any 
adverse event in detail including the date of onset, event diagnosis (if  known) or sign/symptom, 
severity, time course, duration and outcome, relationship of the adverse event to study drug, 
and any action(s) taken. For serious adverse events not considered “probably related ” to study 
drug, the investigator will provide an “Other” cause of the event. For adverse events to be 
considered intermittent, the events must be of similar nature and severity. Adverse events, 
whether in response to a query, observed by  [CONTACT_6404], or reported spontaneously by [CONTACT_340242]. All adverse events will be followed to a satisfactory conclusion.  
 
6.2 Study Monitoring  
 
6.2.1 Data Safety Monitoring Committee  at Georgetown  
The Georgetown Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center will be responsible for the data and 
safety monitoring of this multi -site trial.   As this study is an investigator initiated study phase I  
study , it is considered a high-risk study which requires real -time monitoring by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_583836] 4 months by [CONTACT_289907] (DSMC).  
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_79761] -Investigators will review the data including safety 
monitoring at their weekly institution based disease group meetings , on monthly disease group 
teleconferences , and monthly teleconferences between study sites .  
All Severe Adverse Events (SAEs) are required to be reported to the IRB.   Based on SAEs, the 
IRB retains the authority to suspend further ac crual pending more detailed reporting and/or 
modifications to further reduce risk and maximize the safety of participating patients.  
Progress on the trial and the toxicities experienced will be reviewed by [CONTACT_583842] y [ADDRESS_767731] or 
for Clinical Research at G -LCCC.   Authority to close a trial for safety reasons lies with the IRB, 
with the above described input from DSMC and the AD for Clinical Research.    
6.3 Adverse Event and Toxicity Definitions  
6.3.1 Adverse Event  
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical 
investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily 
have a causal relationship with this treatment. An adverse event can the refore be any 
unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or 
disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or 
not the event is considered causally related to the use of  the product.  Such an event can result 
from use of the drug as stipulated in the protocol or labeling, as well as from accidental or 
intentional overdose, drug abuse, or drug withdrawal. Any worsening of a pre -existing condition 
or illness is considered a n adverse event.  Laboratory abnormalities and changes in vital signs 
are considered to be adverse events only if they result in discontinuation from the study, 
necessitate therapeutic medical intervention, and/or if the investigator considers them to be 
adverse events.  
 
An elective surgery/procedure scheduled to occur during a study will not be considered an 
adverse event if the surgery/procedure is being performed for a pre -existing condition and the 
surgery/procedure has been pre -planned prior to study e ntry.  However, if the pre -existing 
condition deteriorates unexpectedly during the study (e.g., surgery performed earlier than 
planned), then the deterioration of the condition for which the elective surgery/procedure is 
being done will be considered an ad verse event.  
 
6.3.2 Serious Adverse Events  
If an adverse event meets any of the following criteria, it is to be reported to the DSM C as a 
serious adverse event (SAE) within 24 hours of the s tudy personnel  being made aware of the 
serious adverse event.  
1) Death of Subject An event that results in the death of a subject.  
2) Life-Threatening An event that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], would have resulted in 
immediate fatality if medical intervention had not been taken. This does not include an 
event that would have been fatal if it had occurred in a more severe form.  
3) Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_26109]  
4) Prolongation of Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_583837] ’s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408].  This does not include an 
emergency room visit or admission to an outpatient facility.  
5) Congenital Anomaly An anomaly detected at or after birth, or any anomaly that results 
in fetal loss.  
6) Persistent or Significant Disability/Incapacity An event that resul ts in a condition that 
substantially interferes with the activities of daily living of a study subject. Disability is not 
intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical significance such as 
headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (e.g., sprained 
ankle).  
7) Important Medical Event Requiring Medical or Surgical Intervention to Prevent 
Serious Outcome An important medical event that may not be immediately life -
threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but based  on medical judgment may 
[ADDRESS_767732] and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of 
the outcomes listed above (i.e., death of subject, life -threatening, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], 
prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], congenital anomaly, or  persistent or significant 
disability/incapacity). Examples of such events include allergic bronchospasm requiring 
intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions 
that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or 
drug abuse.  
8) Spontaneous Abortion Miscarriage experienced by [CONTACT_62444].  
9) Elective Abortion Elective abortion performed on study subject.  
 
6.3.3 Adverse Event Severity  
The study investigator will rate the severity of eac h adverse event according to the NCI CTCAE 
Version 5.0.  For adverse events not captured by [CONTACT_26277] 5.0, the following 
should be used:  
1) Grade 1 (Mild) The adverse event is transient and easily tolerated by [CONTACT_423].  
2) Grade 2 (Moderate) The a dverse event causes the subject discomfort and interrupts the 
subject ’s usual activities.  
3) Grade 3-4 (Severe or Life Threatening) The adverse event causes considerable 
interference with the subject ’s usual activities and may be incapacitating or life-
threatening.  
4) Grade 5 ( Death ) The adverse event resulted in death of the subject.  
 
6.3.4 Relationship to Study Drug  
The investigator will use the following definitions to assess the relationship of the adverse event 
to the use of study drug:  
1) Definitely  Related An adverse has a clear temporal relationship to study drug and/or 
recurs on re -challenge and an Other cause of event is extremely unlikely.  
2) Probably Related An adverse event has a strong temporal relationship to study drug or 
recurs on re -challeng e and an Other cause of event is unlikely or significantly less likely.  
3) Possibly Related An adverse event has a strong temporal relationship to the study drug 
and an Other cause of event is equally or less likely compared to the potential 
relationship to s tudy drug.  
4) Probably Not Related An adverse event has little or no temporal relationship to the 
study drug and/or a more likely Other cause of event exists.   
5) Not Related An adverse event is due to an underlying or concurrent illness or effect of 
another d rug and is not related to the study drug (e.g., has no temporal relationship to 
study drug or has a much more likely Other cause of event).  
If an investigator ’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_147530], probably not, or not related to study drug is given, an 
Other  cause of event must be provided by [CONTACT_26278].  
 
6.[ADDRESS_767733] ’s partner should become pregnant during the study, 
this should also be reported within 72 hours of study personnel  awareness.  
 
6.7 Toxicity Management and Dose Adjustments  
 
6.7.1 Dose Reduction and Delays  of FFX  
 
As patients will enter the study already having completed 5 cycles of FFX, discretion is given to 
the investigator to continue patients at the same doses as cycle 5. Therefore, all dose 
modifications are recommended but left to  the discretion of the investigator.

We will track the success rate in screening patients, completion of PRT planning, completion of 
proton beam treatment, and completion of adjuvant therapy (including number of cycles 
completed and relative dose intensity).  
 
7.[ADDRESS_767739] v1.1 criteria.  
 
7.2.1 Definition of Lesions  
[IP_ADDRESS] Measurable Disease  
The presence of at least one measurable lesion.  If the measurable disease is restricted to a 
solitary lesion, its neoplastic nature should be confirmed by [CONTACT_3973]/histology.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Measurable Lesions  
Lesions that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension with longest diameter ≥ 20 
mm usin g conventional techniques or ≥ [ADDRESS_767740] scan.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Non-measurable Lesions  
All other lesions, including small lesions (longest diameter < 20 mm with conventional 
techniques or < [ADDRESS_767741] scan), bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites,  
pleural/pericardial effusion, inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonis, cystic 
lesions and also abdominal masses that are suspi[INVESTIGATOR_583838].  
 
All measurements should be taken a nd recorded in metric notation, using a ruler or calipers. All 
baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the beginning of treatment 
and never more than 14 days before the beginning of the treatment.  The same method of 
assessment a nd the same technique should be used to characterize each identified and 
reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up.  Clinical lesions will only be considered 
measurable when they are superficial (e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes). For the  
case of skin lesions, documentation by [CONTACT_3606] a ruler to estimate the size 
of the lesion is required.  
 
7.2.[ADDRESS_767742], abdomen and 
pelvis. For accurate objective response evaluation, ultrasound should not be used to measure 
tumor lesions. However, ultrasound is a possible alternative to clinical measurements of 
superficial palpable lymph nodes, subcutaneous lesions and thyroid nod ules. Ultrasound might 
also be useful to confirm the complete disappearance of superficial lesions usually assessed by 
[CONTACT_12148].  Cytology and histology can be used to differentiate between PR and CR in 
rare cases (e.g., after treatment to diff erentiate between residual benign lesions and residual 
malignant lesions in tumor types such as germ cell tumors).   
 
 
38 
Version 1.0, September 6, 2018  7.3 Definition of Disease Recurrence  
Disease progression will be defined as:  
1) Radiologic progression of disease by [CONTACT_393] v1.1 criteria.  
2) Clinical progression as determined by [CONTACT_093], which may be characterized as, 
but is not limited to:  
a. Increase of at least 2 points in ECOG performance status attributable to cancer 
progression.  
b. Requirement for radiation  (beyond palliative radiatio n for bone pain relief as 
outlined in [IP_ADDRESS]) , chemotherapy or surgery.  
3) Death from disease progression  
  
39 
Version 1.0, September 6, 2018  8.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
8.1 Primary Objective:  
To determine the recommended phase II dose and schedule (RP2D) of short -course PRT 
integrated within adjuvant FFX (radiation 12 days following chemotherapy or 5 days following 
chemotherapy) for resected PDAC. The co -primary objectives are to demonstrate th e safety and 
feasibility of short short -course proton radiation within systemic adjuvant chemotherapy with 
FFX, including the number of cycles received and relative chemotherapy dose -intensity.  
 
8.2 Exploratory Objectives:  
 
To determine, in patients with resected PDAC undergoing PRT integrated within adjuvant FFX:  
 
8.2.1  Median recurrence -free survival (mPFS)  
 
8.2.2  Median overall survival (mOS)  
 
8.3 Primary Endpoint:  
The primary endpoint is to determine the RP2D between the 2  proposed schedules. Using a 
3+3 dose -escalation schema, 2 -12 patients will be required to determine the RP2D.  
Co-primary endpoints:  
 
8.3.1  Safety: adverse event data will be collected and presented as descriptive statistics using 
the CTCAE version 5.0.  
 
8.3.2  Feasibi lity: we will track the success rate in screening patients, completion of proton beam 
planning, completion of proton beam treatment, and completion of adjuvant therapy (including 
number of cycles completed and relative dose intensity).  
 
8.4 Exploratory Endpoin ts: 
 
8.4.1  Recurrence -free survival (RFS), defined as time from surgery until evidence of disease 
recurrence.  
 
8.4.2  Overall survival (OS), defined as time from surgery until death from any cause or last 
follow -up. 
 
8.[ADDRESS_767743] completed 2 cycles of mFOLFIRINOX for resected pancreat ic 
adenocarcinoma will be eligible for enrollment. Proton therapy will occur between cycles 6 and 7.  
In dose level 1 (DL1), patients will complete cycle 6 chemotherapy (days 1 -3) and then receive 
5 days of daily 5 GyE proton therapy on days 15 -19 (excludi ng weekend days) in a 28 day cycle, 
prior to starting cycle 7 (see Figure 1). In DL2, patients will complete cycle 6 chemotherapy 
(days 1 -3) and then receive 5 days of daily 5 GyE proton therapy on days 8 -12 (excluding 
weekend days) in a 21 day cycle, prio r to starting cycle 7. A 3+3 dose -escalation schema will be 
used, requiring 3 -12 patients to be enrolled.  
 
40 
Version 1.0, September 6, 2018  Using a 3+3 dose -escalation design, if 0 of 3 patients experience a dose -limiting toxicity (DLT) 
at DL1, then 3 patients will then be enrolled in DL2 . If 1 of 3 patients experiences a DLT at DL1, 
then 3 additional patients will be enrolled at DL1. If 2 -3 of 3 patients experience a DLT at DL1, 
then the study is terminated. If 1 of 6 patients experiences a DLT at DL1, then 3 patients will be 
enrolled at DL2. If 0 -1 of 3 patients experiences a DLT at DL2, then 3 additional patients will be 
enrolled at DL2. If 2 -3 patients experience a DLT at DL2, treatment will continue at DL1 until 6 
patients are enrolled at DL1. If 0 -1 of 6 patients experiences a DLT at DL2, then DL2 is the 
recommended phase 2 dose and schedule (RP2D). Conversely, if 0 -1 of 6 patients experiences 
a DLT at DL1 AND 2 or greater patients experience a DLT at DL2, then DL1 is the RP2D.  
All cycles will be 14 days, except cycle 6 which is exten ded to 28 days in DL1, including the 5 
daily doses of PRT on days  15-19 (excluding weekend days), and 21 days in DL2, including the 
5 daily doses of PRT on days 8 -12 (excluding weekend days).  
 
8.6 Analytic plan for explorary  objectives  
 
8.6.1  The nonparametric Kaplan -Meier method will be used to estimate median RFS.  
 
8.6.2    The nonparametric Kaplan -Meier method will be used to estimate median OS.  
 
8.7 Safety Assessments  
 
8.7.1  The safety of FFX and PRT  will be assessed by [CONTACT_100651], adverse 
events, serious adverse events, oncology -related events, all deaths, as well as changes in 
laborat ory determinations and vital sign parameters.   
 
8.7.2 A summarization of the number of days and/or cycles subjects were exposed to FFX and 
PRT will be provided.  
 
8.7.3  Analyses of adverse events (and serious adverse events) will include only "treatment -
emergent" events, i.e., those that have an onset on or af ter the day of the first dose of study 
drug. Analyses will not include those that have an onset greater than  [ADDRESS_767744] deaths will be summarized (1) for deaths  occurring while the 
subject was still receiving study drug in this study, (2) for deaths occurring off treatment within 
[ADDRESS_767745] dose of study drug, and (3) for all deaths in this study regardless of the 
number of days after the last dose of  study drug.  The relatedness of the deaths to the study 
drugs will also be provided.  
  
[ADDRESS_767746] (IRB)  
Good Clinical Practice (GCP) requires that the clinical protocol, any protocol amendments, the 
Investigator's Brochure, the informed consent and all other forms of subject information related 
to the study (e.g., advertisements used to recruit subjects) and  any other necessary documents 
be reviewed by [CONTACT_2717]. IRB approval of the protocol, informed consent and subject information 
and/or advertising, as relevant, will be obtained prior to the authorization of drug shipment to the 
study site.  Any amendments to  the protocol will require IRB approval prior to implementation of 
any changes made to the study design.  Any serious adverse events that meet the reporting 
criteria, as dictated by [CONTACT_427], will be reported to the IRB. During the conduct of the 
study, the investigator should promptly provide written reports to the IRB of any changes that 
affect the conduct of the study and/or increase the risk to subjects.

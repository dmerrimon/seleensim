Protocol Title: A Single -Sequence, Open -Label, [ADDRESS_207005] of the Potent 
Cytochrome P -450 3A4CYP3A4 Inhibitor Itraconazole on the Single -Dose Pharmacokinetics of Oral TAK -906 in 
Healthy  Adult Subjects.
Trial Design:
This is a phase 1, single -sequence, open -label, 2 -period crossover trial in approximately 12 healthy male and female 
(nonchildbearing -potential) subjects. The trial is designed to investigate the effect of a potent cytochrome P -450 
(CYP) 3A4 inhibitor (itraconazole) on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of TAK -906. 
The trial will include a Screening Visit, a Period 1 (Day s 1 to 3), followed by a minimum of a 4 -day washout from the 
time of TAK -906 maleate dose, a Period 2 (Days 1 to 6), and a Follow -up Visit. 
On Day  1 of Period 1, eligible subjects will be enrolled into the trial and will receive a single oral (PO) do se of 
TAK -906 maleate 25 mg. On Days 1 to 5, inclusive, of Period 2, subjects will receive itraconazole 200 mg once daily 
(QD) PO solution. Following after an overnight fast of at least [ADDRESS_207006] 8 hours as food reduces its bioavailability by [CONTACT_3450] 40%.
Blood samples for assessment of TAK -906 concentrations will be collected from predose to 48 hours after each dose 
of TAK -906 maleate. 
Safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_174801], vital signs, electrocardiograms ( ECGs) , clinical laboratory 
results, and physical examinations thro ughout each dosing period.
After completion of the trial (or following subject withdrawal), all subjects will return for a Follow -up V isit [ADDRESS_207007] dose of TAK -906 maleate.
Primary Objective:
To evaluate the effect of the potent CYP3A4 inhibitor itraconazole on the single -dose PK of PO TAK -906 maleate.
Secondary Objectives:
To evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single PO dose of TAK -[ADDRESS_207008] Population: Healt hy male and female ( nonchildbearing ) subjects.

CONFIDENTIALMain Criteria for Inclusion:
Healthy  male and female (nonchildbearing -potential) subjects who are aged 18 to 55 years, inclusive, with a body 
mass index (BMI) between 18 to 30 kg/m2, and a body weight >50 kg.
Main Criteria for Exclusion:
Subjects who have a history of clinically significant endocrine, gastrointestinal (GI) (including motility disorder and 
intestinal obstruction), cardiovascular, hematological, hepatic, immunological, renal, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], genitourinary, or 
major neurological (including stroke and chronic seizures) abnormalities or diseases will be excluded from the trial.
Main Criteria for Evaluation and Analyses:
Plasma PK paramet ers (maximum observed concentration [C max], area under the concentration -time curve from time [ADDRESS_207009] quantifiable concentration [AUC last], and area under the concentration -time curve from time [ADDRESS_207010] quantifiable concentration [AUC ∞]) for TAK -906 will be 
derived on Day 1 of Period 1 and on Day 4 of Period 2.
Safety endpoints: 
Safety and tolerability will be assessed through physical examinations, ECGs, vital signs, and clinical laboratory 
results, as well as collection of spontaneous adverse events (AEs).
Statistical Considerations:
The PK parameters of TAK -906 (and metabolites, if possible) will be summarized by [CONTACT_55726]. Linear and semilogarithmic p lots of the mean and individual concentration -time curves will be provided. 
Individual plasma concentration and PK parameter data will be presented in the data listing. 
For evaluation of potential effect of itraconazole on TAK -906 PK, paired t -tests and a ssociated 90% confidence 
intervals (CIs) will be determined on the natural logarithms of C maxand AUCs to assess the exposure between 
regimens (TAK -906 maleate alone and TAK -906 maleate with itraconazole). The geometric mean of the relative 
bioavailability of the TAK-906 maleate with itraconazole regimen relative to the TAK -906 maleate alone regimen and 
the associated 90% CIswill be determined by [CONTACT_176847]-transformed parameters.
Sample Size Justification:
Approximately 12 subjects will be enrolled in this trial. The sample size justification is based on an acceptance range 
of 50% to 200% and assumes that the intrasubject percent coefficient of variation (%CV) for AUC lastand C maxof 
TAK -906 will not exceed 25%. This sample size will provide 80% power to conclude plasma concentration of

CONFIDENTIAL4.0 INTRODUCTION
4.1 Background
The intended indicat ion for TAK -906 m aleate i s to treat pati ents wi th gastroparesi s, a di sorder of 
the stom ach characteri zed by  [CONTACT_176848] c emptying in the absence of mechanical obstruction. 
Symptom s are chronic with epi[INVESTIGATOR_176838] [1]. These symptoms may include 
nausea, vo miting, early satiety , abdominal  pain, and postprandial fullness. The prevalence of 
gastroparesi s in the [LOCATION_002] is 24.2 per 100,000 [2]. In cases o f chronic gastroparesis, 
diabetic (29%), postsurgical (13%), and idiopathic (36%) etio logies comprise the majorit y of cases 
in the tertiary referral setting [3]. Currently in the [LOCATION_002], there exists a large unmet medica l 
need because there are no approved therapi[INVESTIGATOR_176839] s. 
Validated targets for ga stroparesis are the D 2and D 3dopamine (DA) receptors. The D [ADDRESS_207013] notabl e of which are a category of mo vement disorders known as 
extrapy ramidal  symptoms (EPS) [4]. EPS are caused by [CONTACT_176849] D 2receptors in the 
dorsal  striatum  and thus are potential sid e effects of all centrally- penetrant drugs that share this 
mechanism o f action, parti cularly  select ive DA D 2antagonists. Of greatest concern is tardive 
dyskinesia, a severe and often irreversible EPS. The risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_176840] l evel and durati on of  treatm ent and as such, the [LOCATION_002] package insert 
includes a black box warning regarding the chronic use of me toclopramide for l onger than 
12weeks.
Dom peridone is a peri pherally -acting DA D 2/D3receptor antagonist marke ted for use as an 
anti-emet ic and prokinet ic agent in a number of countries worldwide, although not in the United 
States due to its cardiovascular safet y profile which includes a risk for drug -induced long QT 
syndro me, torsades de pointes, and sudden cardi ac death [5].
DA receptor antagonists are effect ive in the treatment of delayed gastric empt ying and 
gastroparesi s symptom s because of the role of D 2and D 3receptors in the upper gastrointestinal 
(GI) tract and in the area postrem a which controls vomit ing [6-8].Both of these areas are outside 
of the bl ood brain barrier. Therefore, a peripherally -selective D 2/D3antagonist could achieve the 
desired efficacy  without the undesired central  nervous sy stem  (CNS )effects [9,10] . TAK -[ADDRESS_207014] ive (ie, very limited penetration of the blood brain barrier) dopamine D 2/D3

investigat ional product and the most recent itraconazole product insert for the appropriate region.
4.2 Rationale for the Proposed Trial
TAK -906 has been shown to undergo oxidative metabolism in human liver microsomes and hence 
involvement of cy tochrome P- 450 (CYP) enzymes is possible (2C8, 3A4 and 1A2). Thus, this 
phase 1, single -sequence, open -label, 2-period crossover tri al is designed to invest igate the effect 
of a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor (itraconazole) on the PK of a single PO dose of TAK -906 m aleate 
25mgin healthy men and wom en.
4.3 Benefit/Risk Profile
As thi s is a tri al in heal thy subjects, there is no expected clinical benefit to the trial participants. 
Potenti al risks are based on clinical findings, the mechanism of act ion, and nonclinical findings. 
Also, there is minimal risk associated with study  procedures including scheduled, periodic 
phlebotomy  (limi ted to <500 mL), and noninvasive procedures including vital sign assessments 
and electrocardiograms (ECGs). The principal mit igation for these ri sks include appropri ate 
select ion of the study  popul ations, the clinical research unit (CRU) study  setting permitting close 
monitoring and rapid inst itution of appropriate care as needed, appropriate specified monitoring 
procedures, and utilizat ion of experienced staff trained in study procedures. Overall, the 
risk:benefit profile is considered appropriate for this trial .

CONFIDENTIAL6.0 TRIAL DESIGN AND DES CRIPTION
6.1 Trial Design 
This is a phase 1, single -sequence, open -label, 2-period crossover tri al in approximately 
12healt hy male and female (nonchildbearing -potent ial) subjects. The trial is designed to 
investigate the effect of a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor (itraconazole) on the PK of TAK-906.
The tri al will include a Screening Visit, a Period 1 (Day s 1 to 3), fo llowed by  a minimum of a 
4-day washout from the time of TAK -906 maleate dose, a Period 2 (Days 1 to 6), and a Follow -up 
Visit. 
On Day  1 of Period 1, eligible subjects will be enrolled into the trial and will receive a single PO 
dose of TAK -906 m aleate 25 m g. On Days 1 to 5, inclusive, of Period 2, subjects will receive 
itraconazo le 200 mg once daily ( QD) PO sol ution. Foll owing after an overnight fast of at least [ADDRESS_207020] 8 hours as food reduces its bioavailabilit y by [CONTACT_3450] 40%.
Itraconazole will be administered to subjects under clinic supervisio n on an outpatient basis on the 
morning o f Days 1 to 3 of Period 2 and during confinement on Day s 4 to 5 of Peri od 2. 
Blood sam ples f or assessment of TAK -906 concentrations will be collected from predose to 
48hours after each dose of TAK -906 maleate. Samples may be assayed for TAK -906 m etabo lites 
if deemed necessary . Urine samples will be collected thro ugh 48 hours and may be assayed for 
TAK -906 concentrations and metabo lites if deemed necessary  for the interpretati on of  data.
Who le blood sam ples for deoxy ribonucleic acid (DNA) pharmacogeno mics (PGx) analysis and 
ribonucleic acid (RNA) iso lation will be collected predose on Day  1 of Trial Peri od 1.
Safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_174801], vital signs, ECGs, clinical laboratory  
resul ts, and physical examinat ions throughout each dosing period.
After complet ion of the trial (or following su bject wi thdrawal), all subjects will return for a 
Follow-up V isit [ADDRESS_207021] dose of TAK -906 m aleate.
6.2 Rationale for Trial Design, Dose, and Endpoints
6.2.1 Rationale of Trial Design and Dose
Itraconazole has been chosen as it is recommended b y the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
and European Medicines Agency (EMA) as a suitable potent CYP3A4 inhibitor for use in 
drug-drug interaction (DDI) studies. CYP3A4 is the most common CYP enzyme responsible for 
oxidative metabo lism, and hence the effe ct of itraconazol e, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, on 
TAK -906 PK will be investigated. This type of DDI trial is typi[INVESTIGATOR_176841]. 
A single -sequence tri al has been chosen to enable assessment of the PK of a single PO dose of 
TAK -906 m aleate in the presence and absence of mult iple doses of itraconazole.
TAK -906
Study No. TAK -906-1003 Page 18of 70
Protocol Incorporating Amendment No. 01 25 May 2017
CONFIDENTIALA single PO dose of TAK -906 maleate 25mg has been chosen as it is expected to be clinically  
relevant ,ie, 25 mg is expected to provide maximal D 2receptor occupancy at a mean C maxof 
approximately  11ng/mL. In addit ion, thi s dose i s well bel ow the m aximum  single dose (300 mg) 
that has been invest igated to date that was shown to be well tolerated in healt hy subjects. The 
chosen dose therefore allows for an increase in exposure due t o CYP3A4 inhibit ion without any  
potenti al safety  concerns. The PKof TAK -[ADDRESS_207022] of itraconazole on TAK -906 PK would 
therefore be expected to be consistent across this dose range.
6.2.2 Rationale for Endpoints
[IP_ADDRESS] PK Endpoints
The primary  endpoint for thi s trial  consists of standard PK variables (C max, AUC last, and AUC ∞) 
thatare used to determine the effect of itraconazole on the PK of TAK- 906 in healt hy subjects.
[IP_ADDRESS] Safety Endpoints
Key safet y endpo ints will be assessed through monitoring of AEs, vital signs, ECGs, clinical 
laboratory  resul ts,and physical examinat ions.
[IP_ADDRESS] Exploratory Endpoints
6.2.3 Critical Procedures Based on Trial Objectives: Timing of Procedures 
For thi s trial, the collect ion ofthe blood sam ples for TAK -906 (PK) i s the cri tical procedure. 
At any postdose time point, the blood samples for TAK -906 (PK) need to be collected as close 
to the exact nominal t ime point as possible.
All other procedures should be co mpleted as close as p ossible, either before or after the 
prescribed/scheduled time.
ECG and vital signs measurements should be performed before the no minal t ime of the 
TAK -906 PK sampling, if scheduled together.
The order of priorit y can be changed during the trial with jo int agreem ent of  the invest igator 
and the sponsor.
Any nonscheduled procedures required for urgent evaluat ion of safet y concerns take 
precedence over all routine scheduled procedures.

CONFIDENTIAL9.3.2 PGx Measurements
[IP_ADDRESS] Blood Sample for DNA and RNA PGx Measurements
When sampling of who le blood for PGx analysis occurs, every subject must sign an informed 
consent/be consented in order to participate in the trial. PGx is a co mponent of the trial; 
participat ion is mandatory .
PGx i s the study  of variations of DNA and RNA characterist ics as related to drug response. There 
is increasing evidence that an individual’s genet ic background may impact the PK ( absorpti on, 
distribut ion, metabo lism, and excretion ), pharmacodynamics (pharmacologic effects), and/or the 
clinical outcome (efficacy and/or safet y).
PGx research in this trial may  be conducted to understand how individual genet ic variat ion in 
subjects impacts their trial drug treatment response. This information may be also be used, for 
example, to develop a better understanding of the safet y and effic acy of TAK -906 and other tri al 
drugs, to increase understanding of the disease/condit ion being studied and other related 
condi tions, gain a better understanding of the drug pharmaco logy and f or generating information 
needed for research, development, and r egulatory  approval  of tests to predi ct response to 
TAK -906. 
Who le blo od samples for DNA and RNA iso lation will be collected fro m each consented subject in 
the trial. If necessary  and f easible, a second aliquot of blood may be taken at a later time point i f 
isolation of DNA fro m the first sam ple was not successful or possible.
Since PGx is an evo lving science, many genes and their funct ions are not y et fully understood. 
Future data may  suggest a rol e of these genes in drug response, which may lead to additi onal 
hypothesis -generating exploratory  research and diagnostic development on stored samples.

[IP_ADDRESS] Biological Sample Retention and Destruction
In thi s trial, specimens for genome/gene analysis will be co llected as described in the Laboratory 
Manual. The genet ic material will be init ially stored at thevendor, or a comparable laboratory , 
under contract to [COMPANY_005], with validated procedures in place, and then prese rved and retained at 
the vendor, or a comparable laboratory with validated procedures in place, for up to but not longer 
than [ADDRESS_207052] results collected 
in the trial. The sample and data are linked to personal healt h informat ion with code numbers; the 
samples are stripped of all personal ident ifying information but a key  linking the samples to 
clinic al analysis data exists. This link means that the subject may be identified but only indirect ly. 
The sample ident ifier will be kept secure by [CONTACT_39805] o f the sponsor.
Subjects who consented and provided a pharmacogeno mic sample for DNA and RNA analysis can 
withdraw their consent at any time and request disposal of a stored sample. Any remaining sample 
that can be ident ified as coming fro m the subject will be destroy ed. The tri al doctor and sponsor

TAK -[ADDRESS_207053] who has 
signed inform ed consent to participate in a trial; it does not necessarily  have to have a causal 
relationship with the treatment.
An AE can ther efore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (eg, a clinically significant abnormal 
laboratory  finding), symptom, or disease temporally  associ ated wi th the use of a drug, whether or 
not it is considered related to the drug.
An untoward finding generally ma y:
Indicate a new diagnosis or unexpected worsening of a preexist ing condit ion. (Intermittent 
events for pre -exist ing condit ions underlying disease should not be considered AEs.)
Necessitate therapeutic intervent ion.
Requi re an invasive diagnostic procedur e.
Requi re discont inuat ion or a change in dose of trial medicat ion or a concomitant medicat ion.
Be considered unfavorable by [CONTACT_4168].
Diagnoses versus signs and symptoms:
Each event should be recorded to represent a single  diagnosis . Acco mpanying signs (including 
abnorm al laboratory  values or ECG findings) or symptoms should NOT be recorded as 
additional AEs. If  a diagnosis is unknown, sign(s) or symptom(s) should be recorded 
appropriately  as an AE(s).
Laboratory  values and ECG findi ngs:
Changes in laboratory  values or ECG param eters maybe considered to be AEs if they  are 
judged to be clinically  significant (i e, if som e act ion or intervent ion is required or if the 
investigator judges the change to be bey ond the range of normal physio logic fluctuati on). A 
laboratory  re-test and/or continued monitoring o f an abnorm alvalue are not considered an 
intervent ion. In addit ion, repeated or addit ional noninvasive testing for verificat ion, evaluatio n 
or monitoring of an abnormalit y is not conside red an intervent ion.
If abnormal laboratory values or ECG findings are the result of pathology for which there is an 
overall diagnosis (eg, increased creat inine in renal failure), the diagnosis only should be 
reported appropriately  as an AE.
Pre-exist ing c onditions:
A pre -exist ing condit ion (present at the time of signing of informed consent) is considered a 
concurrent medical history  condi tion and shoul d NOT be recorded as an AE. A baseline 
evaluat ion (eg, laboratory  test, ECG, X -ray, etc) shoul d NOT be recorded as a n AE unless 
related to a trial procedure. However, if the subject experiences a worsening or complicat ion of 
TAK -906
Study No. TAK -906-1003 Page 35of 70
Protocol Incorporating Amendment No. 01 25 May 2017
CONFIDENTIALsuch a concurrent medical history condit ion, the worsening or complicat ion should be recorded 
appropriately  as an AE (worsening or complicat ion occ urs after informed consent is signed). 
Invest igators should ensure that the event term recorded captures the change in the condit ion 
(eg, “worsening of…”).
If a subject has a pre -exist ing epi[INVESTIGATOR_4068](eg, asthma, epi[INVESTIGATOR_002]), any occurrence of an 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_176843] d only  be captured as an AE if the epi[INVESTIGATOR_4070], serious, or 
severe in nature, that is, invest igators should ensure that the AE term recorded captures the 
change from Baseline in the condit ion (eg “worsening of…”).
If a subject ha s a degenerat ive concurrent condition (eg, cataracts, rheumatoid arthritis), 
worsening of the condit ion should only be captured as an AE if occurring to a greater extent to 
that which would be expected. Again, investigators should ensure that the AE term recorded 
captures the change in the condit ion (eg, “worsening of…”).
Worsening of AEs:
If the subject experiences a worsening or complicatio n of an AE aft er the first administration of 
trial medicat ion or after any  change in trial medication, the worsening or com plicat ion shoul d 
be recorded as a new AE. Investigators should ensure that the AE term recorded captures the 
change in the condit ion (eg, “worsening of…”).
Changes in severit y of AEs:
If the subject experiences a change in the severit y of an AE that is not associated with a change 
in tri al medicat ion, the event should be captured once wit h the m aximum  severi ty recorded.
Prepl anned surgeries or procedures:
Prepl anned procedures (surgeries or therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]) that were scheduled prior to signing of 
inform ed consent are not considered AEs. However, if a preplanned procedure is performed 
early (eg, as an emergency) due to a worsening of thepre-exist ing condit ion, the worsening o f 
the condi tion shoul d be captured appropriately  as an AE. Com plicati ons resul ting from any 
planned surgery  should be reported as AEs.
Elect ive surgeries or procedures:
Elect ive procedures performed where there is no change in the subject’s medical condit ion 
shoul d not be recorded as AEs but shoul dbe documented in the subject’s source do cuments. 
Com plicat ions result ing from an elect ive surgery should be reported as AEs.
Overdose:
An overdose is defined as a known deliberate or accidental administration of investigational 
drug, to or by  a trial subject, at a dose above that which is assign ed to that individual subject 
according to the trial protocol. It is up to the investigator or the reporting physician to decide 
whether a dose is to be considered an overdose, in consultation wit h the Sponsor.
All cases of overdose (with or without associ ated AEs) will be documented on an Overdose

The relationship of each AE to trial medicat ion(s) will be assessed using the fo llowing categori es:
Related: An AE that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of a drug (includ ing the 
course after withdrawal of the drug), or for which possible involvement of the drug can be 
argued, although factors other than the drug, such as underlying diseases, complications, 
concomitant drugs and concurrent treatments, may also be responsibl e.
Not Related: An AE that does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of a drug and/o r 
that can reasonably be explained by [CONTACT_1604], such as underlying diseases, complications, 
concomitant drugs and concurrent treatments.

wording:a)Postmenopausal  (defined as 12 m onths of spontaneous amenorrhea in females 
aged >45 y ears, 6 m onths of spontaneous amenorrhea in females aged >45 y ears 
with serum  FSH levels >40 m IU/mL). A high FSH level in the postmenopausal 
range (FSH >40 IU/L) may be use d to confirm a post -menopausal state in 
younger women (eg, those <45 year old) or women who are not using 
hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy. However, in the 
absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is 
insufficient. Appropriate documentation of FSH levels is required.
Rationale for Change :
Provi de addi tional guidance for performing FSH to confirm postmenopausal status of female 
subjects <45 y ears of age.

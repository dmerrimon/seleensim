McCarter, M.D.   Version Date:    7 September 2016  I. Hypotheses and Specific Aims The successful treatment of melanoma with immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as anti-CTLA-4 and PD-1 antibodies, has altered our thinking and approach to immunotherapy for solid tumors. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_95053], only a portion of patients experience a durable response suggesting that there is room for improvement via enhanced immunomodulatory approaches. Anti-CTLA-4 (ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]) significantly improves overall survival and achieves long-lasting complete responses in some melanoma patients, the number of patients that achieve durable clinical benefit is limited and could be improved by a combined immunomodulatory approach. The objectives of our study are to assess the safety and efficacy of combined treatment with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_455047]-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), brand name [CONTACT_455113], in melanoma patients. We hypothesize that combined treatment with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_455048], increase tumor antigen-specific T cell responses, and decrease immunosuppressive myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in melanoma patients compared to patients treated with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_165].  Specific Aims:  1. To establish the safety and tolerability of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_455049]  2. To demonstrate the reduction in MDSC frequency and suppressive function in peripheral blood of Advanced melanoma patients undergoing ipi[INVESTIGATOR_455050]  3. To determine if the addition of VESANOID to standard ipi[INVESTIGATOR_455051]-specific T cell responses  
Protocol Template Page 2 CF-146, Effective 7/10/[ADDRESS_581841] been successful (1). However, melanoma counters current immunotherapeutic approaches by [CONTACT_455096], a critical barrier that may contribute to low response rates and treatment failure (1). Melanoma continues to be a leading cause of death among adult cancer patients (2, 3). Furthermore, incidents of melanoma continue to increase across all age groups (4).   The antibody therapy specific for CTLA-4, an inhibitory molecule expressed on activated T cells and constitutively expressed on Tregs, has recently been shown to significantly improve overall survival and induce durable, long-lasting responses of greater than 5 years in approximately 20% of treated patients (5, 6). While the results of this monumental study highlight a crucial advantage of immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_455052]-term immunity that is resistant to disease relapse, increased response rates to ipi[INVESTIGATOR_455053]-stage melanoma. One proven mechanism of action for this drug is enhancing the frequency and function of tumor-specific T cells (7). However, immunosuppression may limit the development of effective immune responses in some patients treated with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]. Improving clinical responses to ipi[INVESTIGATOR_455054]-mediated mechanisms in a combinatorial approach is essential for the future success of immunotherapeutic strategies.  MDSCs are a mixed population of immunosuppressive myeloid cells that are key contributors to tumor-induced immunosuppression. Increased numbers of MDSCs are associated with larger tumor burdens, increased tumor progression, and shorter overall survival in several cancers, including melanoma (8-11). These data suggest that targeting MDSCs in a combinatorial approach may improve tumor-specific immune responses, increase clinical responses to immunotherapy, and ultimately increase survival in melanoma patients. In this proposal, we aim to decrease the frequency and/or function of MDSCs in melanoma patients treated with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA).  Investigational product: All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) is a vitamin A derivative that binds the retinoic acid receptor on MDSCs and differentiates immature monocytes into more mature dendritic cells (12). VESANOID is a standard treatment for patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL).  VESANOID (tretinoin) is an FDA-approved commercially available retinoid that induces maturation of APL cells in culture (Appendix B). It is not approved in combination with Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_455055].  It is available in a 10 mg soft gelatin capsule for oral administration. The recommended dose (for APL) is 45 mg/m2/day administered as two evenly divided doses until complete remission is documented. Therapy should be discontinued [ADDRESS_581842] patients and in 67 previously untreated (“de novo”) patients in one open-label, uncontrolled single investigator clinical study (Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center [MSKCC]) and in two cohorts of compassionate cases treated by [CONTACT_455097][INVESTIGATOR_455056] (NCI). 
Protocol Template Page 3 CF-146, Effective 7/10/[ADDRESS_581843], including hemorrhage, infections, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, disseminated intravascular coagulation, pneumonia, septicemia, and cerebral hemorrhage.  There are no reported side effects in patients with solid tumors treated with a short course of 150 mg/m2 VESANOID combined with high dose IL-2 or a dendritic cell vaccine (13, 14).    Pre-clinical findings: Pre-clinical data suggest that VESANOID abrogates the suppressive effects of MDSCs isolated from both human cancer patients and mouse cancer models in vitro (15-17). Furthermore, mice treated with VESANOID have decreased frequencies of MDSCs and increased frequencies of dendritic cells that improve T cell responses against tumors (18-20).   Treatment justification: Although VESANOID is a standard treatment for patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia, it has also been used to treat patients with solid tumors. Renal cell carcinoma patients treated with VESANOID followed by [CONTACT_455098]-2 had reduced frequencies of circulating MDSCs with reduced immunosuppressive function during the VESANOID phase of the treatment regimen (14). However, the subsequent high-dose IL-2 treatment abrogated these effects and resulted in a lack of clinical benefit overall (14). In another recent trial, VESANOID was used in combination with a dendritic cell vaccine targeting p53 mutations in small cell lung cancer patients (13). The survival outcomes have not yet been reported; however, the study demonstrated that the frequency and function of MDSCs was reduced following VESANOID treatment and that p53-specific T cell responses were increased in more patients receiving the combinatorial therapy compared to patients receiving the dendritic cell vaccine alone (13).   Description of population to be studied: Advanced melanoma patients undergoing standard ipi[INVESTIGATOR_45777].  Study rationale: Reducing immunosuppression by [CONTACT_455099][INVESTIGATOR_455057] T cell activation and expansion, increasing the overall effectiveness and success of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_45777]. This pi[INVESTIGATOR_455058]-specific T cells and simultaneously block immunosuppressive mechanisms are beneficial in melanoma patients. 
Protocol Template Page 4 CF-146, Effective 7/10/11  Preliminary Studies  Our preliminary research has identified a population of immunosuppressive MDSCs (Lineage negative, HLA-DR negative, CD11b positive, and CD33 positive) that are increased in Stage IV melanoma patients relative to healthy donors. To establish MDSCs as a potentially important contributor to immunosuppression in melanoma patients, we compared the frequency and function of immunosuppressive MDSCs in the peripheral blood of healthy donors, Stage I, and Stage IV melanoma patients (11). We found significant increases in the frequency of MDSCs in the peripheral blood of Stage IV melanoma patients compared to healthy donors. We showed that the frequency of these cells correlates with an increase in regulatory T cells and an increased level of IL-6 and IL-8 cytokines in the peripheral blood. Furthermore, patients with clinical disease progression had an increased frequency of these cells.  We also found that patients with a high frequency of MDSCs had decreased overall survival and an increased risk of death (hazard ratio 4.83, p = 0.016). This increased risk of death was independent of other clinical factors including age, gender, and treatment regimens. Finally, we demonstrated that MDSCs isolated from Stage IV melanoma patients were significantly more immunosuppressive than those isolated from healthy donors. Overall, these data suggest that MDSCs may be a significant contributor to immunosuppression in melanoma patients and that targeting these cells in a combinatorial approach may improve immune responses against melanoma.   VESANOID induces the differentiation of immature monocytes into more mature cells of the dendritic cell lineage (16, 17, 21). In agreement with these results, our preliminary data suggest that VESANOID induces maturation of in vitro-derived MDSCs. We cultured monocytes from a healthy donor with GM-CSF/IL-4 or GM-CSF/IL-6 to generate mature monocytes of the dendritic cell lineage (a control population) or MDSCs, respectively (22, 23).  In contrast to the control population, MDSCs express low levels of HLA-DR and maintain high expression of CD14, consistent with the phenotype of an immature monocyte. Furthermore, MDSCs express increased levels of molecules that inhibit T cell responses such as Arginase I, NOX1, iNOS, and PD-L1. Conversely, MDSCs cultured with VESANOID are phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_455059], expressing decreased levels of inhibitory molecules and CD14 and increased levels of HLA-DR.  Most importantly, MDSCs derived in vitro with GM-CSF and IL-6 suppress T cell proliferation. However, treatment of these MDSCs with VESANOID eliminates their suppressive effects and restores T cell proliferation. Finally, MDSCs express higher levels of retinoic acid receptors RAR and RXR, suggesting that VESANOID treatment may selectively target these inhibitory cells. These preliminary data and our previous publications demonstrate that our research team has established the protocols necessary to accomplish the experiments outlined in this protocol.

However, patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia treated with VESANOID may develop Retinoic Acid Syndrome, otherwise known as Differentiation Syndrome, characterized by [CONTACT_411], dyspnea, weight gain, hypotension, and pulmonary infiltrates. Expected adverse events known to occur in a minority of patients treated with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_455071]-mediated enterocolitis, hepatitis, dermatitis, neuropathies, and endocrinopathies. A recent study showed that of the patients treated with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_79285], 14.5% reported grade 3 or higher immune-related adverse events (irAEs) (24). The same study showed that of the patients treated with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_455072]100 vaccine, 10.3% reported grade 3 or higher irAEs (24). Most of these events occurred within the 12 week treatment schedule, with only 1 patient (0.15%) reporting a grade 3 irAE >70 days after the final dose of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] (24). Most severe adverse events were successfully managed using published protocol-defined guidelines (administration of corticosteroids, delays in treatment schedule, or discontinuation of treatment); 1.1% of deaths were attributable to irAEs.   Following standard protocols for ipi[INVESTIGATOR_45777], patients will be closely monitored for expected signs and symptoms of diarrhea, pain, mucus or bloody stool, fever, rash, muscle weakness, sensory alterations, headache, fatigue, mental status changes, hypotension, and visual disturbances.   Potential VESANOID Side Effects Virtually all patients experience some drug-related toxicity, especially headache, fever, weakness, and fatigue. These adverse effects are seldom permanent or irreversible nor do they usually require interruption of therapy. Some of the adverse events are common in patients with APL, including hemorrhage, infections, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, disseminated intravascular coagulation, pneumonia, septicemia, and cerebral hemorrhage.

Risks to the patient include potential disclosure of protected health information, pain and bruising due to standard risks with venipuncture, and adverse events associated with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_164]/or ipi[INVESTIGATOR_455080]. The risks associated with participation in this trial will be discussed in full detail during the consent process and will be clearly presented to the patient in advance. All potential subjects have will have the option of receiving standard of care or supportive care/hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3677].   Protections Against Risk  
Protocol Template Page 13 CF-146, Effective 7/10/[ADDRESS_581856] eligibility determination: Study applicants will undergo complete laboratory tests and physical exams to determine their eligibility and safety of their participation in this study. Study applicants will be excluded if they do not meet the eligibility criteria. Subjects will also be excluded if other clinical problems that may contraindicate their participation in this study exist.   - Adverse event assessment: During the treatment phase of the study, participants will be asked about adverse events at each clinic visits and vital signs will be obtained before administering the study medication. Patients will not receive the medication if they have any signs of symptoms that may contraindicate its administration. All adverse events occurring during the course of the study will be collected, documented, and reported to the principal investigator. Each clinic visit, a study investigator will review the adverse events since the previous visit. The study investigators will follow all adverse events to the point of a satisfactory resolution. A study participant may have their medication discontinued or may be withdrawn from the study if the medically responsible investigator determines it is the best decision in order to protect the safety of a participant. All adverse events will be assessed to determine if they meet criteria for a severe adverse event. Adverse event collection will conclude at the final study visit, within 30 days of their final ipi[INVESTIGATOR_182].  - Serious adverse event assessment: Severe adverse events, as defined by [CONTACT_1622], will be systemically evaluated at each clinic visit. Any severe adverse event, whether or not related to the study medication, will be reported to the principal investigator, the COMIRB, and the UCCC DSMC. Initial severe adverse event reports will be followed by [CONTACT_63664] a completed severe adverse event reports to the above parties. In the event that a patient withdraws from the study or the investigator discontinues a patient due to severe adverse events, the patient will have the appropriate follow-up medical monitoring. Monitoring will continue until the problem has resolved or stabilized with no further change expected, is clearly unrelated to the study medication, or results in death. A summary of the severe adverse events that occurred during the previous 6 months will be included in the data safety monitoring report to the DSMC.   VESANOID Related Toxicity  Significant VESANOID related toxicity is defined as any >= grade 3 non-hematologic toxicity related to VESANOID, or other grade VESANOID related adverse events that lead to treatment discontinuation. An exception is VESANOID related headache not optimally managed with supportive care therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (acetaminophen or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication).    Toxicity and Study Discontinuation Criteria 
Protocol Template Page 14 CF-146, Effective 7/10/11   The trial stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_455081] 2 and 3 below will be followed to avoid posing undue risk to additional patients. 24 patients will potentially be recruited in each arm of our study as necessary to fulfill the efficacy endpoint. Toxicity in Arm B will be monitored using the Bayesian approach (25, 26) as extended by [CONTACT_210872] (27). Toxicity is defined as AEs of grade 3 or higher, any >= grade 3 non-hematologic toxicity related to VESANOID or combined Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_455082] 3 or higher.. Historical data of similar patients show an overall toxicity rate of 10-15% for ipi[INVESTIGATOR_455083] (Arm A). It is expected for the current trial that Arm A and B will have toxicity rates at a maximum of 15% and 25%, respectively.   The prior probabilities of toxicity for Arm A and B are modeled by [CONTACT_455104] (Beta (0.3, 1.7)). Denoting the historical probabilities of the rate of toxicity in Arm A by p(TOX, H), and the probabilities of the rate of toxicity in Arm B by p(Tox, Arm B), the following formula will be applied to calculate the trial stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_455084]: for Arm B, patient recruitment will stop if Prob{p(TOX, H) + dTOX < p(TOX, Arm B)| data} > 0.8, where dTOX = 0.1.  Patients in Arm B will be monitored according to the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_455085] 2 and 3. If recruitment to Arm B is stopped due to toxicity, recruitment to Arm A will also be stopped. Patients with significant irAEs will be treated using protocol-defined guidelines.  Table 2: Calculated Trial Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_455086] 3mg/kg

Database: Study data will be collected and managed using REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture). REDCap is a secure web application designed to support data capture for research studies, providing user-friendly web-based case report forms, real-time data entry validation (e.g. for data types and range checks), audit trails and a de-identified data export mechanism to common statistical packages (28). The database is hosted at the University of Colorado–Denver Development and Informatics Service Center (DISC), which will be used as a central location for data processing and management.  REDCap data collection projects rely on a thorough study-specific data dictionary defined in an iterative self-documenting process by [CONTACT_455107]. The research team can create and design surveys in a web browser and engage potential respondents using a variety of notification methods.   
Protocol Template Page 16 CF-146, Effective 7/10/11  The database will be designed and maintained by [CONTACT_455108].  The study coordinator will enter the following data at the conclusion of each clinic visit: - Subject information form (name, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_260815], study identification number, date of birth, gender, ethnicity, and Stage of disease) - Subject visit form (date of visit, treatment received, and pi[INVESTIGATOR_10685]) - Adverse event form (signs and symptoms, onset, severity, toxicity grade, action taken, outcome, likeliness of being study related)  The data manager will enter the following data at the completion of the study: - Disease history (primary diagnosis, disease progression) - Treatment history (previous treatments) - Sample Information (blood volume, cell counts, storage location, assays performed)   Data and Safety Monitoring The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_420654]. Rene Gonzalez, a medical oncologist and director of the Melanoma Research Clinics at the University of Colorado Denver, will be responsible for monitoring the trial per the trial monitoring plan, monitoring the safety and efficacy of the trial, executing the DSM plan and for complying with all reporting requirements to local and federal authorities. This oversight will be accomplished through additional oversight from the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) at the University of Colorado Cancer Center (CU Cancer Center).  The DSMC is responsible for ensuring data quality and patient safety for all clinical studies at the CU Cancer Center.  The team of treating medical oncologists and the PI [INVESTIGATOR_455089]. The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_9042] a Data Safety Monitoring report to the DSMC every 6 months that will include a protocol summary; current enrollment numbers; summary of toxicity data to include specific SAEs, UAPs and AEs; any dose modifications; all protocol deviations; and protocol amendments. The DSM report to the DSMC will also include, if applicable, the results of any efficacy data analysis conducted. Results and recommendations from the review of this six month report by [CONTACT_455109]. A summary of the DSMC activities follows:  • Conduct of internal audits • Ongoing review of all reportable adverse events and all serious/unanticipated adverse events  • Has the authority to close and/or suspend trials for safety or trial conduct issues  • May submit recommendations for corrective actions to the CU Cancer Center’s Executive Committee   Per the CU Cancer Center Institutional DSM Plan, SAEs, UAPs, and reportable AEs are reported to the DSMC and the IRB.  All SAEs, UAPs, and reportable AEs are to be reported to the DSMC within 5 business days of receiving notification of the occurrence.   
Protocol Template Page 17 CF-146, Effective 7/10/[ADDRESS_581858]’s treatment outcomes will be monitored at weekly team meetings by [CONTACT_455110] (CRCs). Toxicity will be addressed in real time and communicated to the team, then submitted to DSMC as indicated. Data regarding number of subjects, significant toxicities, dose modifications, and responses will be discussed and documented in the minutes.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_9042] a DSM report to the UCCC DSMC on a six month basis after the first patient is enrolled. DSM reports will contain data from all participating sites. The DSM report will include summaries of minutes taken at monthly meetings, the participants’ demographic characteristics, expected versus actual recruitment rates, treatment retention rates, any quality assurance or regulatory issues (including a summary of any protocol deviations), summary of AEs and SAEs, summary of dose modifications, and any actions or changes with respect to the protocol. The DSM report to the DSMC will also include, if applicable, the results of any efficacy data analysis conducted. Results from these reviews will be provided to all participating investigators to submit to their IRBs at the time of continuing review.  Serious Adverse Events, Unanticipated Problems, and Other Reportable Events  All SAEs will be submitted to the DSMC mailbox within [ADDRESS_581859] of all reportable events will be provides to COMIRB with each annual review.  An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered "serious" if, in the view of the investigator, it results in any of the following outcomes:  - death - life-threatening adverse event - inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] - persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions - congenital anomaly/birth defect.    Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  Unanticipated Problems (UAPs) include adverse events which in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_455090] - both unexpected and probably or definitely related to the drug - any unforeseen development that potentially increases the likelihood of harm to participants or others in the future - information that indicates a change to the risks or potential benefits of the research

Other Reportable Adverse Events include  - death unrelated to study treatment if occurring within [ADDRESS_581860] sizes will be reported. Kaplan-Maier overall survival curves and interval censored progression-free survival curves for the two arms will be generated. Median survival times and 95% confidence intervals will be reported. Correlations between the frequencies of MDSCs and T cell subsets or expression of activation markers will be evaluated using Pearson Correlation Coefficients.  The characterization of potential side effects and toxicities associated with combined ipi[INVESTIGATOR_455091]. Safety outcomes will be assessed using the Bayesian approach. Study discontinuation criteria will be followed as outlined in Table 2.   Power Analysis  We powered our study based on the second of our primary objectives, to show that VESANOID treatment reduces the frequency of MDSCs in melanoma patients. Our previous study showed that a small sample size was sufficient to detect two-fold increases in the frequency of MDSCs in Stage IV melanoma patients (n = 34, p = 0.041) (11). Furthermore, a recent clinical trial combining VESANOID and a dendritic cell vaccine found approximately two-fold decreases in the frequency of MDSCs with 12 patients treated with VESANOID (p = 0.02) (13). With a conservative assumption of a large variance for the change in MDSC frequency in each group (assume the measurement for pre- and post-treatment has a correlation coefficient = 0.1 and used the larger variance of the two to obtain a variance = 6 for the change), and a conservative estimate for the magnitude of change in the Arm B (1.8, or 10% less than was observed in the previous clinical trial using VESANOID), a sample size of 24 patients in each arm will provide 80% power to detect differences in the change of MDSC frequency between Arm A and Arm B using one-sided two-group t-tests with an alpha of 0.05. This sample size will also provide 
Protocol Template Page 19 CF-146, Effective 7/10/11  over 85% power to detect the change of 1.[ADDRESS_581861] of VESANOID may be weaker than the previous study on which we based our patient sample size. Although we believe this study will provide valuable information regardless of the outcome, we plan to compare the effects of VESANOID in patients with high versus low pre-treatment frequencies of MDSCs as a potential biomarker for targeting this combined treatment to subsets of melanoma patient’s in future clinical trials.   Knowledge to be Gained  Approximately 20% of patients receiving ipi[INVESTIGATOR_455092] 4 months. Patients in both arms of the study may potentially benefit from ipi[INVESTIGATOR_45777]. Our hypothesis is that adding VESANOID to ipi[INVESTIGATOR_455093]. Therefore, the possible benefits outweigh the risks associated with participation in this study. Furthermore, the exploratory research aims of the study may guide future therapy by [CONTACT_455111].   This trial is testing the general hypothesis that combining drugs that target immune cell activation with drugs that target blocking immunosuppression are more beneficial to the treatment of melanoma patients. We will also be collecting data on the response of the immune system to this treatment both in frequency and in function. The knowledge to be gained is how VESANOID affects the immune system, whether it augments the immune cell activation caused by [CONTACT_40105][INVESTIGATOR_125], and whether it improves clinical responses to ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]. Although we are testing these hypotheses in melanoma patients, this knowledge may be applicable to other cancer patients where ipi[INVESTIGATOR_455094]. Furthermore, these data may help in the design of future combinatorial treatments as new drugs that target immune cell activation become available.

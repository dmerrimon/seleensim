Nearly 5,000 Veterans undergo abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair each year in VA  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600]. 
Randomized trials, including the VA -based Open Versus Endovascular Repair (OVER) Trial, have  found 
endovascular AAA repair (EVAR), is associated with lower perioperative morbidity and mortality, less pain,  
and shorter length of stay than open surgical repair (OSR) However, OSR is more durable, has fewer  long-
term complications such as late rupture, and Veterans treated with EVAR and OSR have similar survival 
within  two years following surgery. Given these tradeoffs, controversy remains as to which method is best 
suited for  an individual Veteran who AAA repair, and preliminary analyses needs have found broad 
variations across  VA hospi[INVESTIGATOR_868058].  
 
Treatment decisions for AAA need to be aligned with  Veterans' preferences. For example, a Veteran for 
whom a rapid recovery is of primary importance and  long-term durability a lesser concern has a treatment 
preference  which aligns most closely with EVAR. Similarly,  a Veteran who wishes to avoid repeated follow -
up visits and late re -interventions has a treatment preference  that aligns most closely with OSR. However, 
while AAA treatment type varies across VA hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600], i t is unknown  if these treatment variations occurs as 
a result of Veterans preferences, or independent of  Veterans'  preferences. Surgeon preferences for repair 
type have been poorly described, especially for surgeons  treating Veterans.  
 
In preliminary work, we have performed observational analyses, surveys, and cognitive interviews. This  
works has demonstrated variation in AAA repair type in VA and refined qualitative methods to better  
understand Veterans' and surgeons’ treatment decisions. In this proposal, in a cohort of Veterans who are 
candidates  for either repair type (OSR or EVAR), we will use a survey explore Veterans' knowledge and 
preferences for  AAA repair, and determine if Veterans who receive a decision aid as well as the survey a re 
more likely to  receive their treatment  choice.  
 
We describe a cluster -randomized trial comparing two ways to better align Veterans' preferences  and 
treatments for AAA: (1) a validated decision aid describing AAA repair types with a survey measuring  
Veterans' preference for repair type -- versus (2) the survey alone. Enrolled Veterans will be candidates for  
either endovascular or open repair, and be followed at VA hospi[INVESTIGATOR_868059] . In Aim 1, we will determine Veterans' preferences for endovascular 
or open repair  and identify domains associated with each repair type. In Aim 2, we will compare 
agreement between  Veterans' preferences and repair type between the decision aid+survey and  survey -
alone groups. We will identify  factors associated with agreement. Our findings will be reported to the 
National Surgery Office Vascular  Surgery Advisory Board to help ensure Veterans' preferences remain at 
the center of AAA treatment decisions.  We have recruited [ADDRESS_1211194]  PD/PI:  [INVESTIGATOR_868057],  Philip

reconstruction is performed as shown in Figure 1. The 
risk of perioperative death is 3 -5% for  open  AAA 
repair, even in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_868060]. 
The chance of major  complications  such as bleeding, 
need for further surgery, or heart attack, can 
approach 20% within the  first year.10-13 
  
The development of endovascular AAA repair (called 
EVAR) in the 1990s changed the  treatment  options 
available for patients with AAA14. Stent -grafts could 
be placed through small incisions  in the groins to 
exclude the aneurysm from blood flow, without any 
need for a large  abdominal  incision or aortic clampi[INVESTIGATOR_007] 
(Figure 2). Short  term recovery was now much 
simpler, and  vascular  surgeon s rapi[INVESTIGATOR_868061].  
 
Equipoise between repair types for A AA: 
Endovascular repair and open surgery have  been  
compared extensively in a variety of settings, 
including large randomized trials within VA1-3, 9. In 
these studies, the less-invasive nature of endovascular repair demonstrated several  advantages:  lower 
rates of perioperative mortality (less than 2% versus 5%), shorter length of stay (2 versus  7 days), and 
better patient quality of life earlier after AAA treatment15. Howeve r, endovascular  repair  had clear 
disadvantages as well. For example, Veterans treated with EVAR commonly  develop  leaks around their 
graft called endoleaks, which can require secondary procedures, and can  result  in late aneurysm  rupture16-
21. 
 
These tradeof fs have made it difficult to find a clear “winner” between endovascular repair  and open 
surgery. While the randomized trials gave surgeons and Veterans important  information  about the 
short and long -term outcomes of each approach, they failed to identify a  single  AAA repair type that 
would be best for all Veterans with AAA. Because of these tradeoffs,  equipoise  still remains as to the 
optimal AAA repair  type.  
 
Variation in treatment type for AAA : This equipoise in AAA repair type has led to variation in AAA  
repair  type across VA hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600] (Figure 3). While many have studied changes in AAA repair type in  
Medicare  patients39-41, variation in repair type in VA hospi[INVESTIGATOR_868062]. Therefore, to 
explore  this variation, we perfor med preparatory -to-research analyses42. Our work demonstrated four -
fold variation  in repair type across different VISNs.  For example, in 2009, nearly 80% of AAAs were 
Figure 1: Open AAA Repair
Figure 2: Endovascular AAA Repair

8 
 repaired with  open  surgery in VISN 8, and 20% 
underwent endovascular repair (Figure 3). 
However, in VISN 1, the opposite  wastrue – 
fewer than 20% of AAAs were  repaired  using 
open repair, and more than 80%  were  repaired 
with endovascular repair. The  results  seen at 
the VISN level were similar in a  recent  survey 
of the twenty sites in our  study.  Preliminary 
analyses also showed us  that measuring AAA 
repair within the VA itself  is necessary. For 
example, we measured  the proportion of AAA 
treated with open repair in  VA in the la st five 
years. We found that  the proportion of AAA 
repaired with open  repair  declined by 3% in 
absolute terms, from 36%  to 33%42. When 
compared to patients treated  at non-VA 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600], using data from the  Society  for 
Vascular Surgery43, the decline in  open  repair was 19% in absolute terms (from 40%  21%). These data 
suggest that treatment preferences for Veterans differ from non -Veteran populations.  As such, using 
data from non -Veterans is unlikely to be a good substitution, and it would be best to learn  about  our 
Veterans’ preferences directly – from our Veterans  themselves.  
 
Why we need to understand Veterans’ preferences : After our preparatory -to-research analyses,  two 
findings were clear: (1) high -quality randomized trials have demonstrated that outcomes such as  aneurysm - 
related mortality and overall mortality are equivalent between endovascular and open repair, and (2)  
significant  variation in AAA repair type exists across VA. One might ask, why does it matter if there is 
variation in  AAA repair  type if the two repair types are similar, based on traditional procedure -related  
outcomes?  
 
The best answer to this question integrates three important concepts: the disparate nature of the two  
repair  types , the risks inherent to each repair t ype, and the need to align treatment for AAA with  Veterans’  
preferences . Open repair requires a large abdominal incision, a greater physiologic challenge during  
surgery,  and a more prolonged recovery when compared to endovascular repair, but is more durable tha n 
endovascular  repair. A Veteran who must travel long distances for appointments, for whom reliable follow -
up is not  possible,  or who has chronic worry and anxiety, has treatment preferences likely to align with 
open repair.  Conversely,  endovascular repair , while less invasive, requires close follow -up with multiple 
imaging tests for several  years  after repair, with the potential for late complications years following the 
initial treatment. A Veteran who  needs  to return to work quickly to ensure that his or  her job is not 
endangered by a prolonged recovery has  a treatment preferences likely to align with endovascular repair. 
Therefore, aligning Veteran preference  and repair type is necessary to achieve the best patient -centered  
outcomes.  
 
Have Veterans’ preferences for AAA repair type been examined befo re? Significant attention has  been  
dedicated towards determining the comparative effectiveness of endovascular and open repair. However,  
less attention has been given to understanding Veterans’ preferences for repair type. In fact, other than  
measuring  quality of life metrics in the context of VA randomized trials23, to the best of our knowledge,  
Veterans’  preferences for repair type remain undescribed. Three studies outside of VA – two surveys of 
National  Health  Service beneficiaries in England44, 45 and a report of six focus groups in Canadian 
patients46 – have begun  to study patient preferences for AAA repair type. However, these findings may, or 
may not, represent  the preferences seen in US Veterans. These preliminary analyses suggest studies 
within the VA are  necessary.  
 
Why would a Veteran receive an AAA repair type that is not aligned with his/her preference? To better  
understand why a Veteran might receive a repair that was not aligned with his or her preferences,  we 
performed two preliminary cognitive interviews with Veterans who underwent endovascular or open 
repair  in recent years. Findings from these interviews led us to develop a theoretical model built upon

 two well-known  theories outlined by [CONTACT_868087]: a lack of informed choice 
(described by [CONTACT_868088]9 and Weinstein 47, 48) and an overestimate or underestimate of risks (described by 
[CONTACT_868089]5, 6, 8). 
 
Lack of informed choice: First, the Veteran may not have a preference because he or she was never  given  
the opportunity to clearly understand the options for treatment47, 48. If the Veteran has not been  fully 
apprised of the treatment options, he or she is  not capable of making a truly “informed”  decision.  
 
For example, during our interview, one Veteran at our center described his  interaction:  
 
The surgeon simply told me, “Your aneurysm needs to be repaired, and it is best for us to fix it  
using  the new way, endovascular.”  I never knew there was a choice, and they never gave me an  
option”  
 
Given the time constraints of current surgical practice, surgeons often use paternalistic care patterns to  
assign  patients with the treatment the surgeon feels is “bes t” – without reviewing other options with 
patients.  Surgical  decisions, especially those made in the context of cardiovascular diseases which 
require time tradeoffs  and competing risks, can be especially difficult for physicians to explain 6, 49, 50. 
There fore, this lack of  informed  choice does little to foster shared decision -making with Veterans about 
ways to repair AAA48, 49. 
 
• Overestimate or underestimate risks: Even if a physician actually attempts to engage a patient in  
sharing  knowledge about a health care decision, two tendencies can “derail” the process of shared  
decision  making. First, the description can be biased in a way that reflects the providers’ beliefs and  
assumptions,  rather than the patients51. Second, patients may not understand the  magnitude of the 
risks, as  patients  tend to overestimate benefits and underestimate risks 6, 49, 50. These tendencies can 
result in  providers  following the “letter of the law” in shared decision -making, but still ending up with a 
decision that is  unlikely  to be aligned with the Veterans’ preferences for  treatment.  
 
My surgeon explained, “Your aneurysm is now large enough that we should repair it. While there  
are two ways to fix the aneurysm, the better choice for you is an endovascular, because you will 
recover  more quickly.” But I ended up having to come back for many visits over the years, 
because of leaks.  I even needed a second procedure Maybe it would have been better to just fix 
it the old -fashioned  way.”  
 
How considering Veterans’ preferences will help to improve outcomes : Misalignment of  treatment  
preferences can result in poorer satisfaction with surgery52, 53. This dissatisfaction can have real effects  
for Veterans. For example, Veterans treated with open repair may have more com plications, more work  
loss, greater rates of depression, and more social isolation because of the longer recovery time32, [ADDRESS_1211199].  Barry  is a Co -Investigator in this proposal, and represents an important link to the VA’s 
existing work in  shared - decision making10. Our proposal will help advance this science by [CONTACT_868090] -making models in the treatment of Veterans with vascular disease in 
VA. Poor decision  satisfaction  and limited shared dec ision-making are likely to result when treatment 
decisions are made without  considering  patient preferences60, 61. We hypothesize that overestimating or 
underestimating risk may result in  poor alignment between Veterans’ preferences and the repair type 
they receive for treatment of their  AAA.

Specific Aims  
We describe a cluster -randomized trial comparing two ways to better align Veterans' preferences  
and treatments for AAA: (1) a validated decision aid describing AAA repair types with a survey 
measuring  Veterans' preference for repair type -- versus (2) the survey alone. Enrolled Veterans will 
be candidates for  either endovascular or open repair, and be followed at VA hospi[INVESTIGATOR_868063] . The conceptual framework for our study is 
illustrated in  Figure 4. 
Figure 4: Conceptual Model  
  
 
 
 
Aim 1: To identify Veteran and surgeon factors associated with preference for endovascular or  
open  repair. We will use validated survey instruments to determine repair type preference (endovascular 
or open)  for Veterans and surgeons, and identify domains in our survey associated with each repair  type.  
 
Hypothesis (H1): We hypothesize Veterans who prioritize concerns about pain or disabilit y will  prefer  
endovascular repair, and Veterans who prioritize concerns about durability will prefer open  repair.  
 
Aim 2: To determine the effect of the decision aid on agreement between preference and repair  
type.  AAA growth rate estimates suggest 85% of our cohort will undergo repair within our two – year 
study  period.  Among patients in the intervention and control groups who undergo repair, we will compare 
how commonly  Veterans receive the repair type they indicated as their preference. We will study 
potential  explanatory  variables from our survey, such as AAA knowledge, between the intervention and 
control groups.  Patient  satisfaction and shared decision making will be assessed in both the intervention

11 
 and control  groups.  
 
Hypothesis (H2): Our intervention will be associated with better agreement between preference and  
treatment  type for Veterans with AAA, as well as higher post -operative satisfaction and greater shared  
decision -making.

Study Design : Our cluster -randomized trial has two Specific Aims.  First, we will test the effect  of an 
intervention (decision aid + survey) versus the survey alone on preferences for repair type  (Aim 1). We 
hypothesize that the intervention will be associated with a greater preference for  open  repair among 
Veterans who value long -term durability in their repair  type.  
 
In Aim 2, we will test the effect of the intervention (decision aid +survey) versus the survey  alone  on 
agreement between Veterans’ preference and actual treatment (Aim 2). We hypothesize  that the 
intervention will be associated with greater agreement between Veterans preferences and  the repair type 
they receive.  
 
Our instrument – both the decision aid and survey - was developed and validated by [CONTACT_604991][INVESTIGATOR_868068]28. We modified to use [LOCATION_002] English language (Appendix 1).  In preparatory -to-
research work, we pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] -tested the instrument in two cognitiv e interviews at  White  River Junction and 
administered the instrument to five patients at three sites. We will test  the effect of our intervention 
(versus control) on the following outcomes: (1) Veteran preference  for repair type, and the domains 
associated  with preference for each repair type, (2) the  agreement  between Veterans’ preferences and 
their actual repair type, and (3) the Decision Regret  Scale,  administered 30 days after repair to assess 
decision  satisfaction.  
 
Definition  of “Usual  Care” : In both the intervention  and control  groups,  Veterans  will have  “usual  care”  for 
the treatment  of their AAA.  This is defined  as a routine  outpatient  consultation  with a VA vascular  surgeon  
for their AAA and AAA repair  at the discretion  of the surgeon  during  the study  period. Estimates from the 
MASS trial80 and RESCAN meta analyses 81, [ADDRESS_1211236] that 85%  of enrollees  will progress  to repair  
during  the study.  In this study, usual care will be provided by [CONTACT_3476].

Aim 1:
To identify factors associated with a

preference for Open.Hypothesis 1:
Most veterans will prioritize concerns over pain or 
disability and have preferences for Endovascular; 
however, Veterans with concerns about durability 
will prefer Open Repair.
Aim 2:  
To determine how commonly preferences 
align with treatment for Veterans who 
undergo AAA repair.Hypothesis 2:
Intervention will result in better alignment of 
preferences and treatments, better treatment 
satisfaction, and more shared decision -making.

[ADDRESS_1211237] for  our group  to meet  biannually  during  the study  period.  
 
Characteristics and selection of the study population : Our study population will be  Veterans  and vascular 
surgeons enrolled at the ten intervention sites and ten control sites in our cluster -randomized trial.  The 
inclusion criteria for patients will be V eterans with a >5.0 cm AAA that  are candidate s for endovascular 
and open r epair. Step C of the Study Procedures describe the recruitment procedures and inclusion 
criteria in detail.  
 
 
STUDY PROCEDURES  
 
Step A: Recruitment of Surgeons Twenty VA hospi[INVESTIGATOR_868070].  Each local site investigator has been interviewed and their credentials 
vetted by [CONTACT_978] , and has accepted to participate in the study . Local site investigators may invite one or 
two additional surgeons whom they work with at their site to pa rticipate in the study.  Site Study 
Coordinators will provide surgeons the Study Invitation and Information Sheet at the start of the study 
period  and document the date . A waiver of documentation of informed consent for surgeons will be 
requested since the  surgeon’s participation involves no procedures other than completion of a survey 
and presents no more than minimal risk.   
 
Step B: Selection of Intervention C enters : In Aim 1, we will conduct the intervention  in [ADDRESS_1211238]  a 9:[ADDRESS_1211239] a similar proportion of Complex  and Intermediate Surgical VA 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_868071]. These are the only  two types of VA hospi[INVESTIGATOR_868072]. Sites will be randomized at IRB approval in  a rolling fashion. Site specific Study Coordinators 
will use the Study Protocol to facilitate  IRB approval.3, 15. 
 
Step C: Recruitment of Pa tients : We are requesting a waiver of informed consent for recruitment  since 
potential participants will be identified through the screening process described as follows.   
 
i. Potential candidate referred to VA vascular surgery clinic . The first contact [CONTACT_868095] a referring physician  indicates that they should be seen by a vascular 
surgeon for treatment of their AAA, and the patient is given an appointment for a consu ltation 
with a vascular surgeon  at a study site .  
 
ii. Identification of 12 Ve terans with a >5.0 cm AAA who are candidates for  endovascular  and open 
repair . The Site Study Coordinator will screen all new consultations made to  VA vascular surgery 
clinics for Veterans with AAA that meet size criteria of ≥ 5.0 cm. Baseline  audits at three clinics 
indicate ~15 new AAA referrals  per vascular surgeon per month, and 60% of Veterans have an 
AAA that meets size  criteria. Assuming a refusal rate of 50%, we anticipate we will enroll fully 
three months after  enrollment  begins, with a screening rate of 8 patients per  site per month and 
an enrollment rate of  four patients per site per  month.  
 
iii. Ensuring Veterans with AAA are candidates for both endovascular and open surgical repair . 
Radiologic reports for new AAA consultations will be re viewed by [CONTACT_868096] (Appendix 1). If a patient has an AAA that meets these 
size criteria (≥5.[ADDRESS_1211240] the Site Principal 
Investigator.  The Site Principal Inves tigator will review imaging tests and the Veteran’s electronic 
health record to ensure the Veteran is a candidate for endovascular and open repair using 
anatomic and clinical criteria defined according the Instructions for Use for each individual aortic 
endoprosthesis. These criteria derive from the Instructions -For-Use protocols determined by [CONTACT_868097]/PI:  [INVESTIGATOR_868057],  Philip   
[ADDRESS_1211241] discretion in interpretation 
for placement of an endovascular prosthesis outside of IFU guidelines. If the Veterans meets 
criteria for both open and endovascular repair, the Site Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_868073] . 
 
iv. Inviting Veterans who are candidates to participate in the study:  Once a candidate has been 
identified, the Study Coordinator will note the time of the Veteran’s appointment. When the 
Veteran arrives for their appointment, they will check in as usual and proceed to the waiting room.  
The first contact [CONTACT_868098] a consult room . Once in the consult room, the Study 
Coordinator or other Study Team Member  will use the Study Introduction Script (Appendix 5), to 
descr ibe the intervention to the Veteran (decision aid and survey)  and invite them to participate . 
Veterans will be offered  some  time to review the consent form . If they wish  to have more time  to 
discuss it with their family and friends , they may reschedule their appointment and return on a later 
day.  The Veteran will be informed that they will be  remunerated $[ADDRESS_1211242] 
appointment for their time spent completing study documents and  surveys.  
 
v. Consent process:  Once a Veter an has expressed interest in the study, t he Study Coordinator or 
other Study Team Member will review the consent form with them , answer any questions, and 
obtain consent. For any Veterans who are unable to read, the study coordinator will read the 
consent form to them  in the presence of a witness . A witness is required to be  present during the 
entire  consenting process for illiterate participants and the witness will sign the informed consent 
to indicate he/she witnessed the participant “making their mark” consenting to be in the study.   
After consent has been obtained by [CONTACT_9137], the Veteran will be taken through the 
survey process.   
  
Step D: Survey administration at intervention and control sites:  
 
Process at  the Intervention S ites:  
 
Step 1: The Pre -Survey will be administered with the Veteran by [CONTACT_868099]. (2  
minutes)  
Step 1a: The Study  Coordinator will review the Decision Aid  with the Veteran. (5 -10 minutes)  
Step 1b: The Study  Coordinator will administer the Survey.  (10 minutes)  
Step 2: The Study  Coordinator will escort the patient to the  visit with the vascular  surgeon.  
Step 3: After the Visit, the Study  Coordinator will complete  the Decision -Process Score with 
the Veteran. (5  minutes)  
Step 4: Thirty days after AAA repair, the Study  Coordinator  will complete the PSQ -18 with the 
Veteran. (5  minutes).  
 
The decision aid is available in English and  Spanish.  
 
The patient will be remunerated at completion of the  enrollment visit.  Data will be recorded 
securely by [CONTACT_868100].  
 
The Veteran will be thanked for their participation by [CONTACT_372785] a  formal  letter mailed 
from the Principal  Investigator.  
 
Process at the Control Sites:  
 
Step 1: The Study Coordinator  will administer the Survey.  (10 minutes)  
Step 2: The Study Coordinator  will escort the patient to the  visit with the vascular  surgeon.  
Step 3: After the Visit, the Site -Specific Research Coordinator will complete  the Decision -
Process Score with the Veteran. (5  minutes)  
Step 4: Thirty days after AAA repair, the Study Coordinator  will complete the PSQ -[ADDRESS_1211243]  PD/PI:  [INVESTIGATOR_868057],  Philip   
19 
 Veteran. (5  minutes)  
 
The patient will be remunerated at completion of the  enrollment visit.  Data  will be recorded 
securely by [CONTACT_868100].  
 
The Veteran will be thanked for their participation by [CONTACT_372785] a  formal  letter mailed from the Principal  
Investigator.  
 
Surgeon survey administration at both the intervention and control  sites:  
 
Step 1:  The Study  Coordinator will administer the  Pre-Visit  Survey to the surgeon (1 minute, 
according to pi[INVESTIGATOR_868074],  and two sites outside the  trial).  
Step 2:  The surgeon will have the clinic visit with the  Veteran.  
 
Step 3: After the Visit, the Study  Coordinator will complete  the Post -Visit Survey with the 
surgeon (1  minute).  
 
Data will be recorded securely by [CONTACT_144224].  
 
Recruitment Target:  We will recruit 12 Veterans per site (4 Veterans per site per month for  3 months) at 10 
sites in the intervention arm for a total of 120 Veterans in the intervention arm.  We will recruit 12 Veterans 
per site (4 Veterans per site per month for 3 months) at 10 sites in  the control arm for a total of 120 
Veterans in the control arm. The unit of analysis will be the  Veteran.  Randomization will occur at the site 
level, in a stratified 9:1 randomization scheme, based on  the VA hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]’s Surgical Complexity 
designation. We will enroll 8 Complex and 2 I ntermediate  sites per arm.  Randomization will occur at the 
time of IRB  approval.  Weekly conference calls with Site Study Coordinators will assess study enrollment 
rates and help  with problem -solving.   
 
Exclusion C riteria : Veterans with AAA who are not a  candidate for both endovascular and  open  surgical 
repair will be excluded. Veterans who have already undergone AAA repair will  be excluded. We will 
include Veterans who speak English and Spanish, using a translated  survey  instrument (Appendix 2). 
Veterans  who cannot read will be offered participation by [CONTACT_868101].  
 
Time Frame : Our study timeline is shown in Figure 6. IRB approval and site randomization  will occur 
during the first [ADDRESS_1211244] Year  (PY1). Enrollment will begin at PY1 Month 3,  and will be 
completed by [CONTACT_868102]1 at all sites (a conservative estimate). After two -year follow -up on all sites in 
our cohort during PGY2 -3, we will examine our final outcomes and complete  reports  and manuscripts in  
PY4.

Risk to Subjects (Veterans and Surgeon  Participants).  
 
Human Subjects Involvement and  Characteristics . 
Aim 1: Cluster -Randomized Trial of a Decision Aid and Survey (versus Survey alone)  for different types of 
AAA Repair  
In our study, we will identify Veterans presenting to Vascular Surgery Clinic with  abdominal aortic 
aneurysms who are candidates for endovascular or open repair.  
 
Sources of  Materials.  
Aim [ADDRESS_1211246] PHI , with study entrants being 
assigned a study identifier throughout the data  management process.  The study key that allows identification 
between individual study patients and their p rotected health information (PHI) will remain behind VA firewalls 
and will  not be routinely used as part of the study analyses. We will create individual random identifiers for 
each study patient, and all study dates will be removed and replaced with  time-to-event variables to limit any 
potential PHI contained in study  datasets.  
Potential Risks for Veterans .  
Decision Aid and  Survey  
Our cluster -randomized  trial will compare  the effect  of a patient  educational  tool (the decision aid) on 
survey responses describing patients’ pref erences for different types of AAA repair. Both types of AAA repair 
are commonly performed across VA, and both are commonly  accepted alternatives for the treatment of  AAA.  
The intervention consists of provision of standardized information to patients, compared  to taking the survey 
alone. Given that the intervention consists only of a standardized delivery  of information th at is commonly 
shared with pati ents during a routine vascular surgery  clinic consultation, there are minimal risks to the 
Veterans who will participate in our survey. All  sites and surgeons will be assigned unique study IDs  in our 
dataset, and indexed only through  anonymous identifiers.  Further, our  data will be stored on VA servers, 
behind VA  firewalls.  
Potential Risks for Surgeons .  
Contact  [CONTACT_4002]/PI:  [INVESTIGATOR_868057],  Philip

 Surgeon Survey  
In both the intervention and control groups, we will examine surgeon preferences for repair  type for each 
Veteran. The surgeon’s name [CONTACT_868112] a ran domly generated identifier, and a  key at each site will be 
kept to allow the surgeon to remain unidentifiable in research  datasets.  
 
All surgeons participating in the study will receive the Study Invitation and Information Sheet  from the Site 
Study Coordin ator at the time of study  initiation.  We anticipate IRB approval for a waiver of documentation of 
informed consent.  
 
For Veterans, there is an control arm (survey alone) and intervention  arm (survey +  decision aid). For 
surgeons, however, all will re ceive the same surgeon survey. T his is simply a  validated survey  which  records  
the factors  they use to make  their decisions.  Given  that the intervention  consists  only of a standardized  
delivery  of information  that is commonly  shared  with patients during  a routine  vascular  surgery  clinic  
consultation,  there  are minimal  risks to the surgeons who will participate in our survey. No identifiable data 
will be made available, placing no risk  on study  surgeons.  All sites and surgeons  will be assigned unique 
study IDs  in our dataset,  and indexed  only through  anonymous  identifiers.  Further,  our data will be stored  on 
VA servers,  behind  VA firewalls.  
 
 
Adequacy of Protection from  Risk.  
Recruitment and Informed  Consent . 
For our survey,  we will perform  recruitment  at the [ADDRESS_1211247] that these data will be maintained  on the White 
River Junction VAMC’s dedicated research server, behind the VA firewall.  Only summary statistical 
analyses are ever exported from the server. Data analysts for this  project will use only the anonymous  
study IDs  to distinguish individual subjec ts; they will not have access  to any other personal identifiers, nor 
will they be able to convert Study IDs to SSNs.  The risk of a data breach that will compromise personal 
information is minimal.  
 
Potential Benefits of Research to Subjects and  Others.  
There are no direct benefits to Veterans or surgeons participating in this research. There is a potential 
benefit for  Veterans enrolled in the intervention  arm of this study , which is clearer pathway for 
communicating their preferences about their abdominal aortic aneurysm to the surgeon treating their 
aneurysm.  Further, the information to be derived will be of great value for the planning of future 
interventions and resource allocation to provide Veterans the best access to the highest quality care for 
high-risk surgical interventions such as AAA repair.  
 
Importance of Knowledge to be  Gained.  
This study  will yield new information  about  outcomes  for expensive  and high-risk conditions/ procedures 
to support the planning of optimal resource allocation. It will distinguish VA  facilities that achieve the best 
outcomes for further study, and it will identify the components of  inpatient services that yield the best 
outcomes for Veterans with AAA. The knowledge to be gained  will help VA planners i mprove access to care 
for patients with high -risk surgical conditions, and  the benefits will greatly outweigh the limited risks to 
confidentiality and patient  safety.

Data and Safety Monitoring  Plan.  
As this study  involves  a survey only,  we do not anticipate any serious adverse event s related to the research, 
and that a ny adverse events which occur during the study period are likely to be related to underlying, pre -
existing medical conditions, and/or the surgery . Therefore, we will not routinely col lect any data to assess 
harms. The Data and Safety Monitoring Committee will be responsible for ensuring that data conduct is 
commensurate with any potential benefits or harms evident in quarterly analysis of study datasets . Any 
unanticipated problems whic h may arise involving risks to subjects or others, related to research 
(including data integrity/security issues) will be documented and reported to the IRB within [ADDRESS_1211248] established a study committee structure as outlined below, consisting of three  central  committees: 
A Steering Committee, A Data Safety Monitoring Board, and a  Publications  Committee.  The committees are 
staffed by [CONTACT_868104], VA -funded surgical investigators (Zhou , Nelson, Johanning, 
Rafetto, Dardik, and Henke).  Each Committee will meet quarterly during the study period .

6. Coding Guide and Data Management Plan  
 
 
Procedures for managing the flow of information from participating sites is detailed below. Any deviation from 
these procedures that might be relevant to participant protection will be reported to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_874] [ADDRESS_1211249]  PD/PI:  [INVESTIGATOR_868057],  Philip   
[ADDRESS_1211250] adhere to the VA Central IRB Table of Reportable Events  all docum ented VA security 
policies and protocol s. Removal of a ccess to research study data will be accomplished for study personnel 
when they are no longer part of the research team.  
 
Step 1: 
 
Each completed survey and consent form will be completed by [CONTACT_868105]-specific Study  Coordinator.  
 
Step 2: 
 
A PDF of the survey document will be created and sent via secure email to a file maintained  on our 
Research Server by  [CONTACT_36909] (led by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. West and [CONTACT_868113] at  White  River  
Junction).   
 
Step 3: 
 
After confirming secure receipt and upload of the PDF onto our Research Server, the Site  Study  
Coordinator will store the original d ocuments in a locked fil e until study  conclusion.  Original documents will 
be destroyed in accordance with the VA Records Control schedule.  
 
Step 4: 
 
The survey data will be extracted by [CONTACT_868106] (SAS) to allow for analysis by [CONTACT_6283]. West and Mackenzie.  A Coordinating Center Research Nurse will 
facilitate this effort as well, and hold biweekly  technical  support calls with the Central Site Study 
Coordinator with all sites during the study  period.  All research datasets w ill be destroyed in accordance 
with the VA Records Control Schedule.  
 
 
Long term follow -up Data  Collection:  
 
To inform the agreement between preferences and repair type, we will compare  the preference identified 
for each Veteran in Aim [ADDRESS_1211251] the enrolled patients  via phone to 
ensure repair has not been performed outside of  VA. 
 
Patients who do not undergo repair or who die prior to repair will be excluded from  this step in the  
analysis.  
 
 
7. Data  Analysis  
 
(Please note: The following sections are described separately for Aim 1 and Aim  2).  
Aim 1: To identify Veteran and surgeon factors associated with preference for endo vascular  or 
Contact  [CONTACT_4002]/PI:  [INVESTIGATOR_868057],  Philip   
24 
 open  repair.  
Aim 1 . Dependent and Independent Variables: The main dependent variable in Aim 1 is the  preference  
for repair type (endovascular or open) as expressed by [CONTACT_868107]. Each survey instrument has a validated coding algorithm which will be used to  
categorize  survey responses into preference for en dovascular or open repair (Appendix 2) 44. 
Independent  variables,  such as age, gender, race, ethnicity, and other descriptive variables are 
recorded as part of the  survey  instrument by [CONTACT_445594]. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_868075] a s annual  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_868076]. West. These variables will be measured at the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_172882], as in prior analyses.65, 97-100 
 
 
Aim 1: .Data analytic strategy: tests, strengths, limitations, and alternative approaches : In Aim 1, our 
main outcome variable will be Veteran and surgeon preference for repair type (endovascular or open 
repair). The preference will be defined as either preference for endovascu lar or preference for open 
repair. Repair type preference will be categorized from several questions in our survey instruments. 
Several questions allow for differing degrees of choice (e.g., strongly/slightly favor open repair).  For 
these responses, we wi ll use variables that allow this category. We will us e a coding algorithm 
(Appendix 2 ) which deconstructs survey questions into components that generate binary outcomes 
(i.e., preference for open or endovascular repair) and allows sensitivity analyses usin g the gradients. 
We will compare the proportion choosing each repair type in the intervention and control groups to test 
the effect of the decision aid on repair type preference. The proportions preferring each repair type will 
be compared between the two groups accounting for clustering of patients within center and/or 
surgeon; in particular, we will used the Mantel -Haenszel test (for stratified contingency tables, 
equivalent to partial likelihood ratio test from fixed effects logistic regression) or a mix ed effects logistic 
regression with fixed effect of group, and random intercept for center effects.  
 
Aim 1 Data Collection Strategy: potential problems and solutions  Refer to Section 6  of this Protocol  
Coding Guide and Data Management  Plan. 
 
To identify patient characteristics (such as survey responses) associated with preference for 
endovascular  or open repair we will use multivariable mixed effects logistic regression. The use of 
mixed effects is to  account  for clustering within individual VA centers using a random intercept, e.g. 
logit Pr[Y_ij=1]=X_ij β+μ_i where  Y_ij is the binary preference variable in subject j from cluster i, X_ij is 
a vector of characteristics, μ_i is a  random  intercept from a zero mean distribution with sta ndard 
deviation to be estimated (e.g. normal), and β is a  vector  of coefficient(s). We will explore the feasibility 
(e.g. convergence) and sensitivity of findings of  patient  characteristics of using ether a random 
intercept for surgeon, or for center, or f or surgeon nested within  center.  We will report both unadjusted 
and adjusted estimates, after identifying one or more models to adjust for  using  for instance stepwise 
regression or LASSO. Stata (e.g.,xtmelogit) and/or R (library lme4 or nlme) software  will be used.  Dr. 
MacKenzie has extensive experience in these  strategies.  
Missing Data: To accommodate missing data where justified (e.g. the variable with missing data is  
predictive  and deserves to be adjusted for, and furthermore the data is believed to be missing at 
random) we shall  use multiple imputation methods, such as implemented in the Stata mi routine.  
Power Analysis: Comparing the effect of the decision aid on repair type preference . Because the 
decision  aid will inform Veterans more fully about the  long-term disadvantages of endovascular repair, 
we hypothesize  that the decision aid will reduce the proportion of Veterans who prefer endovascular 
repair by 25%, based  on similar decision aids studied in surgical settings in breast cancer and back  
pain16-18.

[ADDRESS_1211252] 96% likelihood of detecting a 25% effect size, assuming an ICC of 0.01. 
Sensitivity analyses around our ICC assumption of 0.01 demonstrate that even if our ICC is ten times 
higher (ICC=0.10), our sample size would still yield an 81% likelihood of detecting a 2 5% effect size 
between intervention/control.  
Aim 2:  To determine the effect of the decision aid on agreement between preferences and repair  
type.  
Aim 2 Dependent and Independent V ariables: After identifying Veterans’ preference for endovascular or 
open repair, we will determine the agreement between their preferences and the repair types they 
receive.  The dependent variable will be the kappa statistic (ĸ), measuring agreement between the 
preferred repair type and the repair type the Veteran ultimately receives. Cohen’s kappa will be 
compared between the intervention and control groups. Kappa will be calculated overall and by [CONTACT_2360][INVESTIGATOR_307] 
(using a weighted sum of the kappa s for each hospi[INVESTIGATOR_868077] . As a secondary outcome, Site Study 
Coordinators will administer two surveys to the Veteran. These two surveys will examine patient 
satisfaction (PDQ -18) and shared decision making (Decision Process Score, or DPS)87, 104. Our group 
has used these or similar instruments in prior work 104, [ADDRESS_1211253] practice after 
AAA rep air for both repair types. Completing the surveys in this context will not require any extra visits 
by [CONTACT_68847], an important strength given the elderly population of patients involved in our proposal.  
Aim 2 Data Collection Strategy: potential problems and  solutions: To inform the agreement  between  
preference and repair type, we will compare the preference identified for each Veteran and the actual  
AAA repair type the Veteran receives  at each site . We anticipate that 85% of Veterans will undergo 
repair with in three months after the study visit in which  they are enrolled . However, we estimate that 15% 
of patients will not undergo repair within [ADDRESS_1211254] the 
enrolled patients via phone to ensure repair has not been performed outside of VA.  Patients who do not 
undergo repair or who die prior to repair will be excluded. Sample size calculations incorporate  a dropout 
rate of 10% for this effect. Re -survey will occur for a delay in repair greater than 3 months, if the  pre- 
survey shows a change in V eteran repair preference from the original enrollment  survey.  
Aim 2 Data analytic s trategy : After we have measured the necessary elements for  agreement  
(preferences for repair type and the actual repair type), we will then calculate Cohen’s kappa. We will  
stratify  these analyses for surgeon agreement with the actual repair type (surgeon -preferred repair type 
matches  the actual repair type, surgeon -preferred repair type does not match the actual repair type, and 
surgeon has  no preference in repair type). Of note, Question #8 in the Decision Process Score allows us 
to measure  incidents  where discussion with the surgeon changed the Veteran’s preference after the 
survey. We will  perform  sensitivity analyses including and excluding Veterans who changed preferences. 
To account for  possible  agreement of preference and choice with age, gender and race, we will estimate 
the association of choice  with preference in a multivariable binary regression model that includes age, 
gender and race, and report the  odds  ratio (via logistic link) and rate ratio (via Poisson link). The fitted 
value from the logistic regression model will  be used to calculate the four proportions used in the 
calculation of Kappa agreement using the method of  average  predictions (fitted valu es). Bootstrappi[INVESTIGATOR_164577], as described by [CONTACT_868108]106, will be performed  if individual hospi[INVESTIGATOR_868078].

 Power analysis in Aim 2 : We hypothesized that Veterans who receive the decision aid will be 25% more  
likely  to have a treatment that aligns with their preferences, based on effect sizes seen in similar 
decision  aids16-18. This would increase kappa from a baseline of ĸ=0.7 in the control group to ĸ=0.[ADDRESS_1211255] for a null 
value of ĸ=0.7 in the  control  group, and ĸ=0.[ADDRESS_1211256] 80% power to 
detect a difference assuming  a 50% positive response rate at [ADDRESS_1211257]  a difference in kappa, accounting for dropout (10%) and patients who 
do not undergo repair  (15%).

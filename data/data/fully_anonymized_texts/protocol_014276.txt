BTRX-246040 
Title of Study:  A Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-Controlled, Parallel-group Efficacy 
and Safety Study of BTRX-246040 Administered Once Daily in Patients with Major 
Depressive Disorder with or without Anhedonia 
Approximate Number of Planned Patients: 
100 patients randomized with treatment Phase of Development: 
2a 
Length of Study:  Approximately 17 months 
Primary Objective: 
To evaluate the effects of BTRX-246040 on symptoms of depression in adult patients with 
Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) after 8 weeks of double-blind treatment 
Secondary Objectives: 
1) To evaluate the effects of BTRX -246040 on anhedonia in adult patients with MDD  
2) To evaluate the safety and tolerability of BTRX -246040 in adult patients with MDD 
3) To evaluate the effects of BTRX-246040 on the performance of tasks as measured by 
[CONTACT_584486] (FERT), Probabilistic Reward Task (PRT), and 
Effort Expenditure for Reward Task (EEfRT)  in adult patients with MDD 
Exploratory Objectives: 
1) To evaluate the effects of BTRX-246040 on anxiety-related symptoms in adult patients 
with MDD  
2) To evaluate the effects of BTRX -246040 on pain-related symptoms in adult patients 
with MDD 
3) To evaluate the effects of BTRX-246040 as measured by [CONTACT_584487]: Study NEP-MDD-201 is an 8-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo- 
controlled, parallel-group, multicenter study to evaluate the effects of BTRX -246040 on 
symptoms of depression in adult patients with MDD after 8 weeks of double-blind treatment. 
There will be a 28-day screening period, 8-week active treatment period (during which 
patients will receive either BTRX -246040 or placebo), and an approximate 1- to 2-week off-
drug safety follow-up period.  
Patients will be consented and screened (Visit 1) for the study until approximately 100 patients 
are randomized.  Randomization will be performed in a 1:1 ratio to one  of 2 treatment arms 
(placebo or BTRX-246040 QD) after meeting DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for MDD and study inclusion (see section 8). Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_584488] , as 
indicated by a SHAPS total score ≤ 4 and >  4. The BTRX -246040 starting dose for all eligible 
BlackThorn Therapeutics, Inc. 
Protocol NEP-MDD-201 v6.0 
CONFIDENTIAL   3 patients will be 40 mg QD, initiated at Visit 2 (baseline).  A dose escalation to 80 mg QD will 
occur at Visit 3 (week 1) for all patients.  Patients who tolerate the dose increase will remain at 
a dose of 80 mg QD for the subsequent 7 weeks.  The dose may be decreased back to 40 mg 
QD anytime through Visit 4 (week 2), if required, for tolerability. Patients who cannot tolerate 
40 mg daily will be discontinued from participation in the study. Subsequent visits include 
Visit 5 (week 4), Visit 6 (week 6), and the end of the treatment per iod, Visit 7 (week 8). All 
patients will return to the study site for an off-drug safety follow-up visit approximately 1 to 2 
weeks after discontinuation of study drug. Overall duration in the study for each patient is expected to be approximately 14 weeks .  
Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion and Exclusions (see section [ADDRESS_768532] of criteria): The study population will consist of men and women aged 18 to 
65 years (inclusive) with a diagnosis of MDD as defined by [CONTACT_2681]-[ADDRESS_768533] 4 weeks  but 
not longer than 18 months. At Visit 1 (screening) and Visit 2 (baseline), patients must have 
clinically significant depressive symptoms defined by [CONTACT_584489] (investigator- and computer-
administered) Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale Ò (MADRS) total scores ≥ 26 
with a difference of ≤ 7 points between the Investigator- and computer-administered MADRS 
total scores, a CGI-S score ≥ 4. Patients will be excluded from the study if they present with 
any current DSM-5 disorder other than MDD which is the focus of treatment. Are homicidal in 
the opi[INVESTIGATOR_584461] (any suicide attempts within 12 months 
prior to Visit 1 [screening] or any suicidal intent, including a plan, within 3 months prior to

CONFIDENTIAL   5 Statistical Methods:  The sample size determination was based on the primary endpoint, change from baseline in the Investigator-administered MADRS total score, at Visit 7 (week 8). Approximately 100 patients will be randomized to either BTRX-246040 or placebo in a 1:1 allocation ratio.  A sample size of 44 patients per treatment group will provide 75% power to detect a relative effect size of 0.[ADDRESS_768537] and a significance level of 0.10. All tests are two-sided. To account for patients who may discontinue early and be excluded from the analysis population, a sample size of approximately 50 patients per treatment group (total of 100 patients) will be randomized. All statistical tests will be 2-sided. In this Phase 2 study, statistical tests that are significant at the level of 10% will be considered as demonstrating a trend.  Statistical tests that are significant at the 5% level will be considered as demonstrating a strong trend. Where appropriate, analyses of the secondary efficacy parameters and the exploratory endpoints will report nominal p-values to aid the interpretation of results. No adjustments for multiplicity will be made for secondary and exploratory analyses.  The primary efficacy analysis will be on the Investigator-administered MADRS total score and the key comparison will be the contrast between BTRX-[ADDRESS_768538] visit of the 8-week double-blind treatment period (Visit 7/Week 8) from a mixed-model repeated measures (MMRM) analysis on the change from baseline in the Investigator-administered MADRS. This primary efficacy analysis will be performed on the Full Analysis Set of patients that includes all randomized patients who received at least one dose of study drug and have at least one post-dose efficacy assessment. The following secondary efficacy endpoints will be analyzed by [CONTACT_56412]: 1. Change from baseline to Week 8 on the Investigator-administered MADRS-6 subscale 2. Change from baseline to Week 8 on the Investigator-administered MADRS individual items 3. Change from baseline to Week 8 on the total scores of the HADS subscales, the anxiety subscale (HADS-A) and the depression subscale (HADS-D) 4. Change from baseline to Week 8 on the DARS 5. Change from baseline to Week 8 on the SHAPS (using the original 0 – 14 scoring method and also using an alternative scoring method ranging from 14 – 56) The following secondary endpoints will be analyzed by [CONTACT_584492]-administered MADRS as a covariate. Responder rates defined by: 6. Proportion of patients who demonstrate clinical response, where response was defined by a reduction of at least 50% in the baseline Investigator-administered MADRS total

5 INTRODUCTION 
Major depressive disorder (MDD) is the most common mood disorder and imposes considerable 
economic and humanitarian suffering, such as decreased quality of life, functional impairment, 
and increased mortality rate. By 2020, depressive disorders are expected to be the second highest 
cause of morbidity in the world (Murray et al., 2006) and has be en predicted to become the 
leading cause of disease burden by [CONTACT_2892] 2030 (WHO, 2008). The lifetime prevalence of 
MDD is approximately 16.6% in the [LOCATION_002] (US) (Kessler et al., 2003). Less than one 
quarter of patients with MDD are correctly identified and appropriately treated (Olfson et al., 
2005 ). Patients who receive appropriate medications with available drugs are often under-treated, 
which is attributed to poor compliance and tolerability, and lack of efficacy. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_584466], with a relapse chance rate of 55% to 90% for individuals who 
experienced one or two prior depressions. More than 80% of the individuals who experience a 
second epi[INVESTIGATOR_570993] a third epi[INVESTIGATOR_5319] 3 years (Thase and 
Sullivan, 1995 ).  
A clinical diagnosis of MDD is made based on the continuous presence of at least [ADDRESS_768548] or pleasure in response to rewarding stimuli 
(American Psychiatric Association, 2013: Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental  
Disorders, 5th Edition ). This diagnostic classification assigns equal importance to depressed 
mood and anhedonia thus highlighting anhedonia as a core feature of the disorder. The 
classification system also acknowledges that anhedonia may be present in a subset of individuals 
with MDD. Estimates of significant anhedonia among patients with MDD are rare, one report 
describes an anhedonia rate of approximately 37% among a  sample of 65 individuals diagnosed 
with MDD ( Pelizza and Ferrari, 2009) . Moreover, published data indicates that the presence of 
anhedonia may represent a distinct physiologically based subset of patients with MDD. Evidence 
from functional neuroimaging assessments indicates that anhedonia is linked to disruptions i n 
central reward system functioning and is an important aspect of depression pathophysiology 
(Keedwell et al., 2005) . 
The current mainstays of pharmacological treatments for depression include the use of selective 
serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) (Fava et al., 2007 ; Zupancic et al., 2006 ) and serotonin-
norepi[INVESTIGATOR_5608] (SNRIs) (Stahl et al., 2005 ), which provide reasonable 
treatment options; however, these therapi[INVESTIGATOR_584467], and are often 
associated with undesirable side effects, such as weight gain and sexual dysfunction. The lack of 
efficacy and the adverse events (AEs) associated with the use of these antidepressants lead to 
high levels of treatment discontinuation (Zajecka, 2000). Even with multiple consecutive 
treatments, only a small proportion of patients remain asymptomatic ( Rush, 2007). Thus, there 
continues to be a substantial unmet medical need for new antidepressants with greater response 
rates and improved tolerability.

Nociceptin/Orphanin FQ (Noc/OFQ) is a neuropeptide that acts as a natural ligand for a G 
protein-coupled receptor (Meunier et al., 1995; Reinscheid et al., 1995) encoded by [CONTACT_584494]1. OPRL1 is expressed in brain regions associated with mood disorders and obesity (Florin 
et al., 2000; Berthele et al., 2003) and regulates neuronal activity in regions underlying hedonic processing and motivation (Norton et al., 2002). In non-clinical animal models, nociceptin 
modulates several physiological functions and behaviors including depression, stress and 
anxiety, feeding, locomotor activity, body temperature, substance abuse, memory, and pain (Lambert, 2008; Zaveri, 2016).  
BTRX-[ADDRESS_768550] of human nociceptin receptors (NOPR). 
Preclinical evidence indicates that it has anxiolytic, ethanol-consumption reducing/relapse preventing, antidepressant-like, body weight-reducing and analgesic effects (Witkin et al., 2014; 
Rorick-Kehn et al., 2016; Statnick et al., 2016). Open-label studies have documented increased 
plasma levels of nociceptin in different subpopulations of depressive disorder patients, including bipolar depressed and postpartum patients, as compared to non-depressed controls, which were 
found to be correlated with severity of the depressed symptoms as assessed by [CONTACT_584495] (HAM-D) and Edinburgh Postnatal Depression (EPD) Scale score (Gu et al. 2003; Wang et al. 2009).  
Completed Phase 1 studies showed that BTRX-246040 was well-tolerated in healthy males after 
single administrations of doses ranging from 2 to 800 mg and after multiple daily doses of 40 to 
200 mg (n = 78). There were no deaths, serious adverse events (SAEs), or severe AEs, and the 
overall incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) in the entire Phase 1 program 
was relatively low. There were no findings noted in the clinical laboratory, electrocardiogram (ECG), and physical examination, including neurological examination. No suicidal ideation or 
behavior was detected following BTRX-246040 administration, as assessed by [CONTACT_85317] Ò (C-SSRS). All vital signs were within normal ranges, with no 
notable dose- or treatment-related changes noted following single and multiple doses of 
BTRX-246040 at any dose tested. BTRX-246040 showed a predictable pharmacokinetic (PK) 
profile with low- moderate variability. The terminal half-life of BTRX-246040 was estimated to be 66 to 96 hours.  
Completed Phase 2 studies in male and female patients with MDD (Study I5J-MC-NOAC 
[NOAC]) and male and female patients with Alcohol Use Disorder (AD) (Study I5J-MC-NOAD [NOAD]) showed BTRX-246040 was well tolerated at doses of 40 mg QD over an 8-week 
period.  The dose of 40 mg QD was chosen because results from a single-dose study assessing 
brain Noc/OFQ receptor occupancy (Study I5J-MC-NOAB [NOAB]) predicted that this dose 
BlackThorn Therapeutics, Inc. Protocol NEP-MDD-201 v6.0

There were no deaths or SAEs with BTRX-[ADDRESS_768551] common TEAEs that occurred more frequently with BTRX-246040 than placebo were nausea (7/69 [10.1%] vs. 1/65 [1.5%] patients), insomnia (7/69 [10.1%] vs. 0/65 patients) and dizziness (5/69 [7.2%] vs. 0/65 patients). In study NOAD, the frequency of TEAEs reported was similar between the BTRX-[ADDRESS_768552] study (Study I5J-MC-NOAA [NOAA]) when the data were compared after normalizing for administered dose.

Slightly reduced fetal growth and an increase in minor fetal anomalies occurred at the maternally toxic dose of 200 mg/kg/day which corresponded to an AUC of 204485 ng.h/mL on Gestation Day 17. The Margin of Safety (MOS) for the AUC at the no-observed- adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) of 75 mg/kg/day relative to the AUC at the [ADDRESS_768554] embryo-fetal survival. A slight reduction in fetal weights occurred concurrently with significant maternal toxicity (body weight loss and reduced food consumption) at 100 mg/kg/day (AUC – [ZIP_CODE] ng.h/mL). The MOS for the AUC at the NOAEL of 30 mg/kg/day relative to the AUC at the 40 mg dose in study NOAA is 2.5-fold and 0.9-fold at the expected AUC at the 80 mg dose.  In general toxicity studies, dose-limiting toxicity was mainly related to dose- and exposure-dependent increases in severity of central nervous system (CNS) effects in rats and dogs including ataxia, tremors (dogs only), and convulsions (dogs only). The lowest maximum drug plasma concentration (Cmax) that produced convulsions in dogs (the most sensitive preclinical species) was 2400 ng/mL (approximately 19-fold above the mean Cmax anticipated with 40 mg QD and 7-fold above the mean Cmax anticipated with 80 mg QD).  The current study will use a starting dose of 40 mg QD for which observed Cmax estimates after dosing for 14 days to healthy male patients in Study NOAA ranged from 87.9 to 183 ng/mL (mean=127 ng/mL). The exposure multiple to the lowest convulsive dose in dogs is 19-fold and the exposure multiple to 1/10th the convulsive threshold in dogs is approximately 2-fold based on the mean Cmax at 40 mg observed in Study NOAA. Since this dose was well-tolerated in two separate Phase 2 studies (n = 113 male and female patients treated with BTRX-246040) in which 
BlackThorn Therapeutics, Inc. Protocol NEP-MDD-201 v6.0 
CONFIDENTIAL   21 a trend towards efficacy was observed, dose escalation to 80 mg QD based on individual patient tolerability will be employed in the current study to further explore the effective dose range. PK data are available for the dose regimens of 40, 120, and 200 mg QD, but not for 80 mg QD. The mean Cmax on Day 14 of dosing with 120 mg QD to healthy male patients in Study I5J-MC-NOAA (NOAA) was 570 ng/mL. Thus, the mean Cmax and AUC0-24 with steady-state dosing with 80 mg QD is anticipated to be approximately 350 ng/mL and 3550 ng.h/mL, respectively (intermediate between that of 40 mg QD and 120 mg QD). More information about the known and expected benefits, risks and reasonably anticipated AEs may be found in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB).

7.1 SUMMARY OF STUDY DESIGN  
Study NEP-MDD-201 is an 8-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-
group, multicenter study. There will be a 28-day screening period, 8-week active treatment 
period (during which patients will receive either BTRX-246040 or placebo), and an approximate 
1- to 2-week off-drug safety follow-up period (Figure 1).  
 
Figure 1 Study Design 
Patients will be consented and screened for the study until approximately 100 patients are 
randomized. Randomization will be performed at Visit 2 (baseline) in a 1:1 ratio to one of two  
treatment arms (placebo or BTRX-246040 QD) after meeting disease diagnostic criteria for 
MDD and study inclusion (see section 8). Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_584497], as indicated by a SHAPS total score ≤ 4 and > 4. The BTRX-246040 starting dose for all eligible patients will be 40 mg QD.  A dose escalation to 80 mg QD will occur at 
Visit 3 (week 1) visit for all patients.  Patients who tolerate the dose increase will remain at a 
dose of 80 mg QD for the subsequent 7 weeks.  The dose may be decreased back to 40 mg QD 
anytime through Visit 4 (week 2), if required, for tolerability. Patients who cannot tolerate 40 mg 
daily will be discontinued from participation in the study. Subsequent visits include Visit 5 
(week 4), Visit 6 (week 6), and the end of the treatment period, Visit 7 (week 8). All patients will return to the study site for a safety follow-up visit approximately 1 to 2 weeks after 
discontinuation of study drug. Overall duration in the study for each patient is expected to be 
approximately 14 weeks.

Protocol NEP-MDD-[ADDRESS_768555] selection bias. Having both 
Investigators and patients blinded to treatment assignment (double-blind) controls for 
expectation bias relative to any particular t reatment condition. A placebo arm is included to 
control the patient and Investigator expectations of improvement during the study that could 
confound interpretation of pharmacological effects of treatment.  
Double-blind, placebo-controlled studies are the standard in assessment of efficacy in randomized clinical trials evaluating patients with conditions such as MDD. These patients can 
be significantly responsive to placebo and it is important to use a placebo comparator to discern 
this effect despi[INVESTIGATOR_570999] a possible worsening of symptoms. There have been estimates of 
placebo response rates in MDD clinical trials between 30% and 50%. Certain factors are associated with improvement in placebo -treated patients. These include therapeutic effects 
secondary to interaction with a medical professional, misdiagnosis of the psychiatric disorder, 
clinicians overestimating baseline symptom severity or symptom change, and  regression to the 
mean in patients who began the study with more severe symptoms of illness (Fava et al. 2003). In this study, we take several measures to mitigate these influences.   
Patients will complete a computer-administered diagnostic validation assessment, the Lifetime Illness Characteristics Questionnaire (LICQ), at Visit 1 (screening) using a secure computer 
device provided to the site. The patient’s diagnostic information, based on the responses to the 
computerized interview, will be reviewed by  [CONTACT_1034]-designated independent clinical 
reviewer.  Any uncertainty raised by [CONTACT_102]’s responses on the diagnostic interview will be discussed with the Investigator.  
A tandem assessment process will be used to administer and rate the MADRS. Two M ADRS 
administrations will be conducted at each study visit using a secure computer device provided to 
the site.  One will be administered by a qualified site Investigator. The second will be computer -
administered and will consist of a series of probe and f ollow-up questions with multiple-choice 
response options to be completed by [CONTACT_102]. 
The Investigator-administered MADRS scores will be compared with the computer-administered 
MADRS scores. This will ensure that the MADRS is administered in a reliable,  consistent 
manner throughout the study and avoids potential introduction of bias.

to complete all Visit 7 (week 8) assessments and follow-up visit assessments. 
If early discontinuation occurs, the primary reason will be determined and reported on the study 
completion CRF.  Reasons for early discontinuation listed in the CRF are: Investigator/Physician 
decision, patient decision (withdrawal of consent), Sponsor decision, AE(s), unsatisfactory therapeutic effect, and loss to follow-up.  
1. Investigator/Physician Decision 
a. The Investigator/physician decides that the patient should be withdrawn from the study 
for any reason.  For example, the patient is significantly noncompliant with the study drug regimen (see section 10.8; Patients with investigational product compliance 
≤ 70% over any 2-week visit interval) 
b. After Visit 2 (baseline) the patient is found to have met an exclusionary criterion or not 
met an entry criterion required for study participation.  
c. The patient is enrolled in any other clinical trial involving an investigational product or is enrolled in any other type of medical research judged not to be scientifically or 
medically compatible with this study. 
BlackThorn Therapeutics, Inc. 
Protocol NEP-MDD-[ADDRESS_768562] withdrawal is an adverse event this should be documented as the primary reason for discontinuation. 
3. Sponsor Decision  
a. An Investigator, site personnel performing assessments or patient is unblinded (see  
section 10.6). 
4. The Sponsor stops the study or stops the patient’s participation in the study for medical, 
safety, regulatory or other reasons consistent with applicable laws, regulations and good clinical practice (GCP). 
5. Adverse Event  
a. The patient experiences an AE that would necessitate discontinuation of 
investigational product.  If this decision is made because of an SAE or a clinically 
significant laboratory value, the investigational product is to be discontinued and 
appropriate measures are to be taken (see item 5. d. below). The Sponsor or its Medical Monitor designee is to be alerted immediately (see section 11.3). 
b. Discontinuation should be considered by [CONTACT_584503] a patient has the following abnormal 
liver tests:  
i. ALT  or AST > [ADDRESS_768563] > [ADDRESS_768564] > [ADDRESS_768565] and total bilirubin level > [ADDRESS_768566] > [ADDRESS_768567] and prothrombin time > 1.[ADDRESS_768568] > [ADDRESS_768569] with the appearance of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, 
right upper-quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash, and/or eosinophilia (>5%).  
c. If the patient is thought to be at risk of harm to him/herself or others at any time 
during the study, a further psychiatric assessment by [CONTACT_584504]. Patients must be discontinued from study participation if they:  
i. are assessed as homicidal 
ii. are actively suicidal (any suicidal ideation with intent or specific plan or 
any suicide attempt) 
iii. are at serious suicidal risk as assessed by [CONTACT_941] C-SSRS (score of “YES” on item 4 or 5)

10.1 TREATMENTS ADMINISTERED  
This study involves a comparison of BTRX-246040 versus placebo taken orally once daily for 8 
weeks. Treatment will be initiated at 40 mg (1 capsule) once daily for approximately one week 
then will be increased to 80 mg (2 capsules) once daily at Visit 3 (week 1). One dose reduction 
back to 40 mg (1 capsule) once daily will be allowed through Visit 4 (week 2) for patients who cannot tolerate the 80 mg (2 capsule) dose. Refer to section 10.5 for timing of dose administration.  Table 2 shows the treatment regimens.

The Investigator or his/her designee is responsible for explaining the correct use of the 
investigational product to the patient and site personnel, verifying that instructions are followed 
properly, maintaining accurate records of investigational product dispensing and collection, and returning all unused medication to the Sponsor or its designee at the end of the study.  
10.2 MATERIALS AND SUPPLIES  
BTRX-246040 and placebo capsules and packaging will be identical to maintain Investigator and patient blinding. Patients should be instructed to swallow capsules whole and not crush or chew and store the capsules in their original packaging at the temperature listed on the package label. Clinical trial materials will be labeled according to the regulatory requirements.  
10.3 METHOD OF ASSIGNMENT TO TREATMENT  
Patients who meet all inclusion criteria and are subsequently not excluded by [CONTACT_571045]-blind treatment at Visit 2 (baseline) using an interactive 
web-response system (IWRS). Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of two  treatment 
arms (placebo or BTRX-246040 QD). Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_584509], as indicated by [CONTACT_584510] ≤ 4 and total score > 4. The order in which the PRT and EEfRT administrations are conducted will be assigned via IWRS.   
The IWRS will be used to assign bottles containing double-blind investigational product or 
placebo to each patient. Site personnel may be required to confirm that they have located the 
correct bottles by [CONTACT_45342] a confirmation number found on the package label into the IWRS 
prior to dispensing the bottle(s) to the patient (see section 10.5).

CONFIDENTIAL   42 10.4 RATIONALE FOR SELECTION OF DOSES IN THE STUDY The starting dose for this study will be 40 mg QD taken for 1 week.  A dose of 40 mg BTRX-246040 given QD has been tested and was well-tolerated in two efficacy studies, in male and female patients with MDD (Study NOAC) and male and female patients with AD (Study NOAD).  There were no deaths or SAEs with BTRX-[ADDRESS_768577] common TEAEs that occurred more frequently with BTRX-246040 than placebo were nausea (7/69 [10.1%] vs. 1/65 [1.5%] patients), insomnia (7/69 [10.1%] vs. 0/65 patients) and dizziness (5/69 [7.2%] vs. 0/65 patients). In study NOAD, the frequency of TEAEs reported was similar between the BTRX-[ADDRESS_768578] study when the data were compared after normalizing for administered dose.  In this study, observed Cmax estimates after dosing 40 mg QD for 14 days ranged from 87.9 to 183 ng/mL (mean=127 ng/mL). The exposure multiple to the lowest convulsive dose in the nonclinical study in dogs is 19X and the exposure multiple to 1/10th the convulsive threshold in dogs is approximately 2X based on the mean Cmax at 40 mg.  The 40 mg dose was well-tolerated in two separate Phase 2 studies (n = 113 male and female patients treated with BTRX-246040) and a trend towards efficacy in MDD was observed although the MDD study did not meet the success criteria of the primary endpoint.  For this reason, dose titration from [ADDRESS_768579] in clinical pharmacology studies to date; there are currently no PK data available for BTRX-[ADDRESS_768580] dose of BTRX-246040 or placebo on the day of Visit 2 (baseline) after completing all baseline study procedures.

APPROPRIATENESS OF MEASUREMENTS  
Study procedures and their timing are summarized in the Schedule of Assessments (Table 1).  
All scales and tasks will be completed and/or administered by [CONTACT_584511]. 
11.1 EFFICACY MEASURES  
11.1.1 MONTGOMERY -ASBERG DEPRESSION RATING SCALE (MADRS) 
The MADRS is a semi-structured, Investigator-administered interview to assess the severity of depression among patients with a diagnosis of depression. It is designed to be sensitive to change resulting from antidepressant therapy. (Montgomery, 1979). 
The MADRS includes 10 items assessing the following symptoms: apparent sadness, reported 
sadness, inner tension, reduced sleep, reduced appetite, concentration difficulties, lassitude, 
inability to feel, pessimistic thoughts, and suicidal thoughts. Each item is scored from 0 (absence 
of symptom) to 6 (severe symptom); the overall score ranges from 0 to 60. MADRS total scores from 0 to 6 indicate normal/symptom absent, from 7 to 19 indicate mild depression, from 20 to 34 indicate moderate depression, and from 35 to 60 indicate severe depression.  
The MADRS-6 subscale focuses on the core symptoms of depression and is the sum of items 
about the following symptoms: apparent sadness, reported sadness, inner tension, lassitude, inability to feel, and pessimistic thoughts. Overall score ranges from [ADDRESS_768584] of a 
series of probe and follow-up questions with multiple-choice response options to be completed 
by [CONTACT_102].  
The Investigator-administered MADRS scores will be compared the computer-administered 
MADRS scores. This will ensure that the MADRS is administered in a reliable, consistent 
manner throughout the study and avoids potential introduction of bias. 
At Visit 1 (screening), the computer-administered MADRS will be conducted prior to the 
Investigator-administered MADRS.  At all other visits, the Investigator-administered MADRS 
will be conducted first. 
BlackThorn Therapeutics, Inc. 
Protocol NEP-MDD-201 v6.0 
CONFIDENTIAL   45 The Investigator-administered MADRS data will be collected and maintained independently 
from the computer-administered MADRS data. Investigator-administered MADRS scores will 
never be altered or adjusted.  
11.1.2 SNAITH HAMILTON PLEASURE SCALE (SHAPS) 
The SHAPS is a 14-item self -report instrument which measures anhedonia. It has been shown to 
be valid and reliable in normal and clinical samples. The scale will be completed by [CONTACT_584512]. Each of the 14 items has a set of four responses, two of which endorse agreement (Definitely Agree, Agree) and two of which 
endorse disagreement (Disagree, Strongly Disagree). Under the original scoring method, 
responses endorsing agreement receives a score of 0 and responses endorsing disagreement receive a score of 1. The total score ranges from 0 to 14. A higher total score indicates higher 
levels of state anhedonia (Snaith 1995).  In this study, in additional to the traditional scoring 
method, an alternative scoring method will assign 1 = Strongly Agree, 2 = Agree, 3 = Disagree, 4 = Strongly Disagree.  Under this scoring method, total score ranges from 14 to 56, with higher scores indicating higher levels of anhedonia. 
11.1.3 C
LINICAL GLOBAL IMPRESSION SCALE – SEVERITY (CGI- S) 
The Clinical Global Impression Scale – Severity (CGI-S) is a clinician-rated instrument that 
measures the severity of depression at the time of assessment.  This rating is based upon 
observed and reported symptoms, behavior, and function in the past seven days. The score 
should reflect the average severity level across the seven days.  The CGI-S is scored on a 7-point scale where a score of 1 indicates that the patient is “normal, not at all ill” a score of 4 indicates 
that the patient is "moderately ill" and a score of 7 indicates that the patient is “among the most 
extremely ill patients.” (Guy 1976). 
This scale will be completed by [CONTACT_584513]. Every effort should 
be made to have the same rater perform this scale at each visit for a given patient. 
11.1.4 C
LINICAL GLOBAL IMPRESSION SCALE – IMPROVEMENT (CGI- I) 
The CGI-I scale (Guy 1976) is a clinician-rated instrument that measures the improvement of the 
patient’s symptoms. It is a 7-point scale where a score of 1 indicates that the patient is “very 
much improved,” a score of 4 indicates that the patient has experienced “no change,” and a score 
of 7 indicates that the patient is “very much worse.” 
This scale will be completed by [CONTACT_584513]. Every effort should 
be made to have the same rater perform this scale at each visit for a given patient.

CONFIDENTIAL   46 11.1.6 HAMILTON ANXIETY RATING SCALE (HAM -A) 
The HAM-A is administered to assess severity of anxiety, its improvement during the course of 
treatment, and the timing of such improvement (Hamilton 1960). This instrument will be 
completed by [CONTACT_584514]/her assessment of the 
patient. The scale consists of 14 items. Each item is rated on a scale of 0 (feeling not present) to 4 (very severe prevalence of the feeling). The HAM-A total score is the sum of the 14 items and 
the score ranges from 0 to 56. 
11.1.7 D
IMENSIONAL ANHEDONIA RATING SCALE (DARS)  
The DARS is a dynamic self -report scale that measures desire, motivation, effort and 
consummatory pleasure across hedonic domains.  The patient will complete the scale and it will 
be reviewed by [CONTACT_584506]. It is a 17-item self -report 
measure that consists of 4-component structure mappi[INVESTIGATOR_584474]: hobbies, food/drink, social activities, and sensory experience (Rizvi, et al. 2015). 
11.1.[ADDRESS_768586] TASK (PRT) 
The PRT is a measure of reward learning consisting of trials in which patients are asked to 
respond to two hardly distinguishable cues, of which one is more frequently rewarded.  The task 
will be administered to the patient and reviewed by [CONTACT_571058]. Response bias for the rewarded category is the main outcome of interest (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_7293], et al, 2008).  Other outcomes include discriminability (subject’s ability to 
differentiate between the two cues), accuracy (hit rates), and reaction time.  This task will be 
completed by [CONTACT_584515]-provided study equipment. The order of administration of the PRT will be assigned by [CONTACT_10966]. 
11.1.[ADDRESS_768587] TASK (EE FRT) 
The EEfRT was developed in an effort to dissociate reward components in anhedonia. The task 
will be administered to the patient and reviewed by [CONTACT_584506]. The EEfRT task is a multi-trial game in which participants are given an 
opportunity on each trial to choose between two different task difficulty levels in order to obtain 
monetary rewards.  Patients are required to complete the task with a specific number of button responses within a constrained period of time in order to obtain a monetary reward.  This task 
isolates patient willingness to exert effort relative to size and likelihood of reward that measures 
reward "wanting", in contrast to commonly used anhedonia questionnaires, which focus on reward "liking”. (Treadway et al, 2009).  This task will be completed by [CONTACT_584516]-provided study equipment. The order of administration of the EEfRT will be assigned 
by [CONTACT_10966].

Protocol NEP-MDD-201 v6.0 
CONFIDENTIAL   47 11.1.10 THE FACIAL EXPRESSION RECOGNITION TASK (FERT) 
The FERT is a computer test used to assess attention to, and perception of, social cues and 
affective information. The task will be administered to the patient and reviewed by [CONTACT_584517]. Faces with 6 different basic emotions (happi[INVESTIGATOR_008], fear, anger, disgust, sadness, surprise) are displayed on the screen and the patient is required to indicate the 
expression of the face via a button-press.  Different intensity levels of each emotion are 
presented, which increases the ambiguity of the facial expression and the sensitivity of the task (Harmer et al, 2009).  This task will be completed by [CONTACT_584515]-provided 
study equipment. The FERT will be completed prior to blood draw collections and should not 
immediately precede or follow the PRT/EEfRT. 
11.1.11 D
IGITAL ASSESSMENTS  
Vocal and/or behavioral digital assessments will be conducted with HIPAA compliant digital 
applications that have been download onto the patient’s smartphone with an iOS or Android 
operating system. The applications will be used for active collection of brief vocal samples for subsequent analysis of acoustic features that are associated with affective states and for passive 
acquisition of metadata to assess behavioral patterns that are associated with affective or 
cognitive states. Baseline values will be collected during the screening period prior to the first dose of study drug. Post-baseline values will be collected at periodic intervals during the study to 
be analyzed for potential treatment effects (analysis to be performed in a separate report). Digital 
samples will be reviewed by [CONTACT_584506]. 
11.1.12 H
OSPI[INVESTIGATOR_328650] (HADS)  
The HADS measures levels of anxiety and depression without regards to somatic symptoms 
(Zigmond and Snaith, 1983). The scale consists of 14 items.  Seven of the items are used to 
evaluate anxiety and seven evaluate depression. Each item on the questionnaire is scored from 0 
to 3. Therefore, the anxiety subscale (HADS-A) and the depression subscale (HADS-D) each range from 0 to 21.  Higher scores indicate higher levels of anxiety and depression, respectively.

CONFIDENTIAL   55 11.4.3 SAMPLES FOR DRUG CONCENTRATION MEASUREMENTS PHARMACOKINETICS Two blood samples will be collected on the day of randomization and three blood samples will be collected at the Week 1 and Week 4 visits, at sporadic time points. Population pharmacokinetic analysis will be conducted at a later time.  An additional blood sample will be collected at Visit 7 (end of treatment) to monitor compliance with study medication. Approximately 2 mL of blood will be drawn at each collection time point at the visits specified in the Schedule of Assessments for determination of plasma concentrations of BTRX-246040. Samples will be analyzed for BTRX-246040 at a laboratory approved by [CONTACT_584518] a validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method. It is intended that the blood samples collected from patients receiving placebo will not be analyzed.  If a patient discontinues before study completion, an effort should be made to obtain a blood sample at the time of discontinuation.  The approximate time of the dose administration should be recorded on the day of the blood sampling and for the [ADDRESS_768595] patient visit for the study. During this time, samples remaining after the bioanalyses may be pooled and used for exploratory analyses such as metabolic profiling and/or protein binding work.  Drug concentration information that would unblind the study will not be reported to investigative sites or blinded personnel until the study has been unblinded.  11.4.[ADDRESS_768596] a patient’s response to therapy. Variable response to therapy may be due to genetic determinants that impact drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion, the mechanism of action of the drug, the disease etiology and/or the molecular subtype of the disease being treated. Therefore, where local regulations allow, a blood sample will be collected for pharmacogenetic analysis. It is a one-time collection, as noted in the Schedule of Assessments.  Samples will be stored and analysis may be performed on genetic variants thought to play a role in the nociceptin signaling pathway including, but not limited to OPRL1, to evaluate their association with observed clinical outcomes to BTRX-246040.  In the event of an unexpected AE or the observation of unusual response, the samples may be genotyped and analysis may be performed to evaluate a genetic association with response to BTRX-246040. These investigations may be limited to a focused candidate gene study as described above or, if appropriate, genome-wide association studies may be performed to

CONFIDENTIAL   57 11.5.3 PHYSICAL EXAMINATION Examination of general appearance, skin, neck (including thyroid), eyes, ears, nose, throat, lungs, heart, abdomen, back, lymph nodes, extremities, and vascular status will be conducted at the screening visit.   11.5.4 NEUROLOGICAL EXAMINATION Neurological examination of cranial nerves, motor system, sensory, and reflexes will be conducted at screening and all subsequent study visits. 11.5.5 COLLECTION OF ELECTROCARDIOGRAMS For each patient, single 12-lead digital ECGs will be collected as indicated in the Schedule of Assessments after resting for 5 min.  The ECGs will initially be interpreted by a qualified physician (the Investigator or qualified designee) at the site as soon after the time of ECG collection as possible, and ideally while the patient is still present, to determine whether the patient meets entry criteria at the relevant visit(s) and for immediate patient management, should any clinically relevant findings be identified.  After enrollment, if a clinically significant increase in the Fridericia’s correction method for the QT (QTcF) interval from baseline (e.g. QTcF ≥500 msec and/or QTcF increased ≥ 60 msec) or other clinically significant quantitative or qualitative change from baseline is identified, the patient will be assessed by [CONTACT_584519] (e.g., palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], near syncope, syncope) and to determine whether the patient can continue investigational product. The Investigator or qualified designee is responsible for determining if any change in patient management is needed and must document his/her review of the ECG printed at the time of evaluation for each time point.  All digital ECGs will be electronically transmitted to a designated central ECG laboratory. A cardiologist at the central ECG laboratory will then conduct a full over-read. A report based on data from this over-read will be issued to the investigative site. All data from the over-reads will be placed in the Sponsor database for analytical and study report purposes. Any clinically significant finding that was present on the fully over-read ECG will be reported to the Investigator and to the Sponsor. When there are differences in ECG interpretation between the Investigator (or qualified designee) and the cardiologist at the central ECG laboratory, the Investigator’s (or qualified designee’s) interpretation will be used for study entry and immediate patient management. Interpretations from the cardiologist at the central ECG laboratory will be used for data analysis and report writing purposes.  The Investigator (or qualified designee) must document his/her review of ECGs printed at the time of collection, the final over-read ECG report issued by [CONTACT_81131], and any alert reports.

CONFIDENTIAL   58 11.5.6 SUICIDAL IDEATION /SUICIDALITY  
Suicide-related events (behavior and/or ideation) will be assessed and evaluated at every 
scheduled and unscheduled visit with the administration of the C-SSRS (Posner 2009). The C-
SSRS captures the occurrence, severity, and frequency of suicide-related thoughts and behaviors during the assessment period. The scale includes suggested questions to solicit the type of 
information needed to determine if a suicide-related thought or behavior occurred. The C-SSRS 
was developed by [CONTACT_9887] (Posner 2009) to prospectively categorize suicide-related events. The ‘Baseline’ version will be used at Visit 1 (screening) and ‘Since Last Visit’ will be used for all subsequent visits. 
If a suicide-related event is identified at any time during the study, a thorough evaluation should 
be performed by a study physician and appropriate medical care should be provided. In some 
patients taking antidepressants, worsening of depression, suicidal events (suicidal thinking and/or 
behavior), or unusual changes in behavior have been reported, especially, at the beginning of the drug therapy, at the time of dose changes, or early after treatment discontinuation. It is important 
that patients are instructed to notify their doctor immediately if they have any distressing 
thoughts or feelings at any time related to harm to either self or others.   
The Self -Harm Supplement Form (SHSF) captures the number of discrete events of suicidal 
behavior, possible suicidal behavior, and non-suicidal self-injurious behavior. This scale must be 
administered by [CONTACT_584520].  
The Self-Harm Follow-up Form (SHFU) captures the details of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_584478].  These details include epi[INVESTIGATOR_584479], start and end dates, associated adverse events, 
severity, relationship to study drug, method, intentions, cognition, actions taken, plan, stressors, and follow-up hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6042].  The SHFU is completed at any time that the SHSF number of discrete events is ≥1.

[IP_ADDRESS] PRIMARY EFFICACY ANALYSIS The primary efficacy analysis will be on the change in Investigator-administered MADRS total score from Visit 2 (baseline) to the last visit of the 8-week double-blind treatment period Visit 7 (week 8). The key comparison will be the contrast between BTRX-246040 and placebo at Visit 7 (week 8) from a mixed-model repeated measures (MMRM) analysis. The primary analysis will use the Full Analysis Set. A repeated measures analysis refers to a restricted-maximum-likelihood- (REML-) based, MMRM analysis using all the longitudinal observations at each post-baseline visit. The model for this analysis will include the fixed class effects of treatment, investigative site, visit, and treatment-by-visit interaction, as well as the continuous, fixed covariates of baseline Investigator-administered MADRS total score. An unstructured covariance structure will be used to model the within-patient errors. If the unstructured covariance matrix results in a lack of convergence, the heterogeneous autoregressive variance-covariance structure will be used. Least-square means (LS Means) for the difference to placebo at Week 8, with corresponding 2-sided 95% confidence intervals will be presented in tabular and graphical displays.

CONFIDENTIAL   64 [IP_ADDRESS] SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS OF THE PRIMARY EFFICACY ENDPOINT  The following sensitivity analyses will be conducted on the primary efficacy endpoint to ensure robustness of the primary analysis. The first sensitivity analysis will use the same mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) analysis used for the primary efficacy endpoint.  The change from baseline in Investigator-administered MADRS total score at each post-baseline visit will be analyzed to provide information on the onset and the time course of efficacy. No imputation will be applied to missing data. The second sensitivity analysis will utilize an ANCOVA method. This ANCOVA model will be used to analyze the change in Investigator-administered MADRS total score from baseline to Visit 7 (week 8).  This ANCOVA model will include treatment group and investigative site as fixed effects and baseline MADRS total score as a covariate. The ANCOVA will be applied utilizing two methods of imputation for missing values.  • Multiple imputation for missing values: The results from the ANCOVA on multiple imputed datasets will be combined using the usual Rubin’s rules for multiple imputation.  • Single imputation for missing values: The last observation carried forward (LOCF) imputation will be used. The primary endpoint will be also analyzed based on the Per-Protocol Analysis Set, the Completer Analysis Set, and the MADRS Non-responders at Week 2 Analysis Set using MMRM. An analysis of change from baseline in the computer-administered MADRS will also be performed using MMRM. [IP_ADDRESS] SECONDARY EFFICACY ANALYSES The analysis of the secondary and exploratory endpoints will be based on the Full Analysis Set. All statistical tests will be 2-sided with a significance level of 10%. Where appropriate, secondary efficacy analyses will report nominal p-values to aid the interpretation of results. No adjustments for multiplicity will be made for these secondary analyses.   Analysis of each of the secondary efficacy variables will be based on patients with available data at respective time points used in defining the specific secondary efficacy variable. Missing data for secondary endpoints will not be imputed. The MMRM models used for the primary efficacy endpoint will be used to analyze continuous secondary efficacy endpoints collected longitudinally similar to the primary endpoint (#1-6 listed below).  The MMRM models will contain fixed effects for treatment, investigative site, visit, and treatment-by-visit interaction as well as the continuous fixed covariates of baseline measurement. Change from baseline will be the response parameter of interest.

CONFIDENTIAL   67 [IP_ADDRESS] SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS Analyses will be conducted to assess the validity of assumptions inherent to the primary analysis and to assess the sensitivity of results to untestable assumptions. The primary analysis will also be repeated using the Per-Protocol Analysis Set, the Completer Analysis Set, and the MADRS Non-responders at Week [ADDRESS_768611] of missing data. Departures from the assumed missing at random mechanism will be assessed by [CONTACT_584528]. Full details of these analyses will be provided in the SAP. 13.2.9 DIGITAL ASSESSMENTS Vocal and behavioral digital assessment data are collected in this study. These data will be in a separate report. 13.2.10 PHARMACOKINETIC/PHARMACODYNAMIC ANALYSES Pharmacokinetic data collected in this study will be listed for the Pharmacokinetic Analysis Set. Population PK analysis of the plasma concentrations in this study will be reported separately. Pharmacokinetic data in this study may be combined with data from other studies to obtain improved model estimates and have adequate data for analysis.  Other exploratory analyses, such as the relationship between BTRX-246040 exposure and efficacy measures or AEs or other safety endpoints, may be undertaken as deemed appropriate. 13.2.11 SAFETY ANALYSES Safety assessments include AEs, SAEs, vital signs, weight and BMI, laboratory values, neurological exams, C-SSRS, SHSF, SHFU, and ECGs. All safety analyses will be performed on the Safety Analysis Set unless otherwise specified.  The safety/tolerability of BTRX-246040 and placebo will be compared for rates of spontaneously reported TEAEs, SAEs, AEs associated with self-harm epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841], early study discontinuations, discontinuations from BTRX-246040 or placebo, and AEs leading to discontinuation from the study or from BTRX-246040 or placebo.  Data will be pooled from all investigative sites for the analyses. Safety results will be summarized by [CONTACT_3148]. For categorical variables, frequencies and percentages will be reported and for continuous endpoints by [CONTACT_584529].  13.2.12 SUBGROUP ANALYSES Subgroup analysis based on gender, baseline severity of anhedonia symptoms (SHAPS total score ≤ 4 and > 4; also SHAPS total score ≤ 7 and > 7) and baseline severity of anxiety (HAM-A total score < 20 and ≥ 20) will be performed. Subgroups based on other characteristics may be considered. All subgroup analyses will be exploratory in nature.

1. Abstract  
The major risk factor for HIV acquisition among women is high -risk heterosexual sex, including 
unprotected vaginal and anal sex, and sex with a high -risk partner. Hazardous alcohol use has been 
associated with high risk sexual behaviors and prevalent gonorrhea among women attending an urban STI 
clinic, both of which increase a woman’s vulnerability to HIV acquisition and transmission.  This 
application  proposes a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of a culturally tailored computer -directed brief 
alcohol intervention (CBI) enhanced with cell -phone booster calls using interactive voice response 
technology (IVR) and text messaging among HIV -infected and at -risk women attending an urban STI 
Clinic.  Hazardous drinking women (N=450) presenting to the clinic will be randomized to one of three 
arms: 1) usual clinical care/attention control, 2) clinic -based, CBI, or 3) clinic -based, CBI + 3 booster calls 
using IV R supplemented with text messages. The CBI, an evidence -based method for behavior change uses 
principles of motivational interviewing, to counsel on: 1) alcohol use and 2) associated HIV/STI risk 
behaviors.  Primary outcomes, measured at 3, 6, and 12 month  intervals, include alcohol -related risk 
behaviors (number of binge drinking epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841], drinking days/ week , and drinks per drinking day), sexual 
risk behaviors (number of partners, epi[INVESTIGATOR_898119]/anal sex, epi[INVESTIGATOR_898120]), 
and occurrence of HIV/STI biomarkers.  We hypothesize that a computer -delivered intervention will 
reduce alcoh ol use and high risk sexual behaviors among women attending an urban STD clinic. Prior to 
implementing the RCT, the CBI and IVR software  and text  messages have been revised to 1) include the 
association between hazardous alcohol use and risky sexual behavi ors, and 2) ensure their relevance and 
acceptability using quantitative/qualitative feedback from a sample of women attending a Baltimore City 
STI clinic.  The proposed research focuses on a particularly vulnerable population of urban HIV at -risk and 
HIV-infected women seeking treatment in a public STI clinic and examines novel BI intervention delivery 
strategies specifically tailored to be culturally/socially relevant to this population. If the intervention(s) 
prove to be effective, study findings will off er “real life” specialty care clinics a screening and intervention 
package that is practical, low cost, and easy to implement.

2. Objectives (include all primary and secondary objectives)  
This application proposes a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of computer -delivered BI and 
telephone booster calls using IVR or text messaging for hazardous or binge drinking (>3 
drinks/occasion) HIV -infected and HIV -at risk women (N=450) seeking care for either HIV or 
STIs in an urban STI Clinic.  Study groups reflect three levels of intervention: 1) usual 
care/attention control, 2) clinic -based, computer -delivered, BI + text message boosters, and 3) 
clinic -based, computer -delivered, BI + 3 booster calls u sing IVR. Outcomes will be assessed at 
baseline, 3, 6, and 12 month intervals and will include alcohol -related risk behaviors (number of 
binge drinking epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841], drinking days/ week,  and drinks/occasion), sexual risk behaviors (multiple 
partners, epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841] o f unprotected vaginal/anal sex, alcohol before/during sex), and occurrence of 
HIV and other STIs.  
 
Aim 1 :  To determine the effectiveness of computer -delivered BI (CBI), enhanced with IVR and 
booster text messages in decreasing alcohol risk behaviors among  hazardous/binge drinking 
women attending an urban STI Clinic.  
 
Hypothesis 1a : Women receiving BI + IVR/text will have fewer binge drinking epi[INVESTIGATOR_898121] (number of standard drinks/week, number of drinking days/week) compared to 
usual care.  
Hypothesis 1b : Women receiving BI will have fewer binge drinking epi[INVESTIGATOR_898122] (number of standard drinks/week, number of drinking days/week) compared to usual 
care.  
Hypothesis 1c: Women receiving BI + IVR will have fewer  binge drinking epi[INVESTIGATOR_898121] (number of standard drinks/week, number of drinking days/week) compared to 
BI only.  
 
Aim 2 : To determine the effectiveness of computer -delivered BI enhanced with IVR and text 
messaging boosters in decr easing sexual risk behaviors among hazardous/binge drinking women 
attending an urban STI Clinic.   
 
Hypothesis 2a : Women receiving CBI + IVR/text will report fewer 1) sexual partners,2) epi[INVESTIGATOR_898123], 3) epi[INVESTIGATOR_898124].  
Hypothesis 2b: Women receiving CBI only will report fewer 1) sexual partners,2) epi[INVESTIGATOR_898125], 3) epi[INVESTIGATOR_898126].  
Hypothesis 2c: Women receiving BI + IVR /text report fewer 1) sexual partners,2) epi[INVESTIGATOR_898125], 3) epi[INVESTIGATOR_898127].  
 
Aim 3 : To observe the impact of computer -delivered BI enhanced with IVR and text messaging 
boosters on incidence rates of HIV and STI biomarkers and HIV among hazardous/binge drinking 
women attending an urban STI Clinic.  
 
 Hypothesis 3a : Women receiving CBI + IVR/text will have lower rates of incident 
gonorrhea, Chlamydia or HIV compared to contro l. 
 Hypothesis 3b : Women receiving CBI only will have lower rates of incident gonorrhea, 
Chlamydia or HIV compared to control.  
 Hypothesis 3c : Women receiving BI + IVR/text will have lower rates of incident gonorrhea, 
Chlamydia, or HIV compared to those re ceiving CBI only.

 3. Background   
3.a  HIV among African American Women  
African American (AA) women comprise only 12% of the US female population, and yet account for 
66% of new HIV infections1. Of the 126,964 women living with HIV/AIDS, 64% are black, 19% are white,  The 
rate of AIDS diagnosis for black women (45.5/100,000 women) is approximately [ADDRESS_1258890], HIV/AIDS related conditions are now the leading cause  of death from AA women aged 25 -341.  
High risk heterosexual sex is the major risk factor for HIV acquisition among AA women, including unprotected 
vaginal and anal sex, and sex with a high -risk partner. Faced with these staggering statistics, new, cultura lly 
competent, HIV prevention interventions are critical to improve the health and well -being of AA women.  
3.b HIV among women in Maryland  
In Maryland, HIV/AIDS cases attributable to heterosexual transmission have been increasing 
steadily since 1994, surpa ssing infections attributable to injection drug use in [ZIP_CODE]. In 2003, 36% of 
incident HIV cases were reported among women, 68.5% of which were attributable to heterosexual 
exposure.3  AA women account for 85% of prevalent HIV cases among women in Maryland4. In 2006 there 
were 1022 newly diagnosed cases of HIV in Baltimore City, 87% among AA, and 37% among women3. 
Historically, the vast majority of Maryland residents with HIV infection have first been diagnosed at the 
Baltimore City Health Department’s (BCH D) STI Clinics. Baltimore’s two public STI clinics represent the 
highest volume sites for confidential HIV testing in the state of Maryland with 13,500 tests performed 
annually.  HIV incidence is very high among those accepting testing, and is estimated at  1.5% per year.5 
Baltimore also ranks among the top US cities in STI morbidity; approximately 50% of STI clinic patients 
have a treatable STI at first clinic presentation6.  Baltimore City STI clinic patients are at high risk for HIV 
in a region of high HI V prevalence; therefore, this medical setting is a critical site for HIV prevention.  
3.c STIs and HIV risk among Women  
STIs disproportionately affect AA women.  In 2006, the Neisseria gonorrhea  rate among AA 
women was 14 times higher than that among white  women (618.1and 44.4 per 100,000 population, 
respectively).   The rate of Chlamydia trachomatis  among AA women was more than seven times higher 
than the rate among white women.[ADDRESS_1258891] a woman’s health since they are often 
asymptomatic  and difficult to diagnose.  The health complications from STIs in women are frequent and a 
significant cause of reproductive health morbidity, including pelvic inflammatory disease, and infertility.8, 9  
Furthermore, genital lesions serve as an entry poin t for HIV, resulting in an increased vulnerability to 
acquisition and transmission of HIV infection.  The presence of certain STIs can increase the risk of 
acquiring HIV infection from 2 fold to 5 fold10, 11. Women attending an STI clinic are at particular  risk for 
acquisition and transmission of HIV.   
3.d Alcohol Use Is Linked to HIV, Sex and Drug Risk Behaviors among Women  
The prevalence of HIV infection among alcoholics is higher than that in the general population.12, 13  
Studies  report over 40% prevalence of alcohol problems among HIV -infected individuals.14, [ADDRESS_1258892]: (1) multiple or casual sex partners;16-21 (2) unprotected sexual intercourse22-24; (3) 
intrav enous drug use (IDU) sex partners or sex trading partners for money or drugs.25, [ADDRESS_1258893] been contradictory, although it appears more that s ome inconsistency 
stems from recall bias on the part of inconsistent condom users34 and/or omission of partner  substance 
abuse.35  Such findings underscore the importance of using careful timeline follow back methods as well as 
assessing the partner intox ication status at the time of sex. Alcohol use is also associated with increased 
rates of HIV drug risk behaviors.  Concurrent alcohol and IDU or sharing injection equipment is 
common.36  Stein and colleagues 37-39 studying IDU in a needle exchange program  found that individuals 
 
 
JHMIRB eF ormA   01 
Version 3 Dated:   06/2007   
Page 5 of 38 
 with a history of hazardous alcohol use were over two times more likely to share needles, after controlling 
for demographic and behavioral factors associated with needle sharing.  Using event specific analysis, 
needle sharing days w ere directly linked with alcohol use days.  Alcohol use independently increases the 
risk of engaging in unsafe sexual behaviors and in drug use.  
3.e. Alcohol Use Is Linked to STIs/HIV among Women  
Alcohol use is associated with Chlamydia, and gonorrhea, ev en when behavioral risk factors are 
controlled.40-[ADDRESS_1258894] year STI compared with 
4.2 percent of those who were binge drinkers (>[ADDRESS_1258895] 30 days), and 7.3  percent 
of heavy alcohol drinkers (>[ADDRESS_1258896] 30 day). 
Importantly , alcohol consumption appears to directly increase the risk of HIV infection. A large scale  study 
of more than 8,000 women in Rakai, Uganda found that consuming alcohol before sexual intercourse 
increased the risk of acquiring HIV by 40% for women. The study also found that if both partners 
consumed alcohol, the risk increased by 81% for women.46 Whether mediated by [CONTACT_898153], alcohol abuse can enhance risk of HIV acquisition.  
 Among HIV -infected women  alcohol use is prevalent and has been associated with increased STI. 
Among a sample of predominantly AA HIV infected women,  52% had a positive score on the CAGE 
questionnaire.  Among these women, a +CAGE was associated with 1) trichomonas vaginalis  and 2) 
having sex only while drinking alcohol or having sex with their partner when they both had been 
drinking.47 In addition, al cohol use has recently been shown to be associated with HIV -1-RNA vaginal 
shedding among women on antiretroviral therapy.  Among an urban sample of HIV infected women, 
moderate to hazardous levels of alcohol use were associated with vaginal shedding of HIV -RNA (>50 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/ml) after adjustment for HIV viral load, immunosuppression and antiretroviral adherence.[ADDRESS_1258897] that hazardous alcohol use in an important target for intervention among HIV infected 
women.  
3.f. Alcohol Use Is a Barrier  to HIV Prevention Interventions and Treatment Adherence  
Alcohol use is a barrier to HIV prevention interventions.  In the NIMH National Multisite HIV 
Prevention Trial of 3,104 participants from 37 clinics in 7 regional sites, alcohol problems were a 
signi ficant predictor of relapsed and unprotected patterns of sexual behavior among participants in the 
intervention condition over 1 year.  The authors concluded that, “HIV preventive intervention efforts 
should include a focus on alcohol abuse”.49  Patients w ho are HIV+ and drink at hazardous levels have 
lower rates of antiretroviral therapy use and worsening virologic and immunologic status.50 
3.g. Treatment for Hazardous Alcohol Use Can Reduce HIV Risk Behaviors  
Treatment of hazardous alcohol use, however, c an be effective in reducing sexual and drug risk 
behaviors and HIV transmission.  Among alcoholic patients, HIV risk behavior decreased when treatment 
was provided for alcohol abuse51, 52.  Stein and colleagues performed motivational interviewing as a brie f 
intervention to reduce alcohol intake among needle exchange participants. They found an average reduction 
in drinking days from 12 at baseline to 8.3 at six months.53 Importantly, a subsequent analysis demonstrated 
a reduction in HIV risk by [CONTACT_898154].54Thus, 
alcohol treatment can be considered primary HIV prevention.  
3.h Alcohol Use among Women  
Women are important targets for alcohol interventions.   Women are more sensitive to alcohol 
impairme nt than men.  Controlling for body weight, women achieve higher blood alcohol levels than men 
after drinking equivalent amounts. 55 Although women are less likely than men to develop alcohol abuse or 
 
 
JHMIRB eF ormA   01 
Version 3 Dated:   06/2007   
Page 6 of 38 
 dependence, they are over represented among harmful/haza rdous drinkers.[ADDRESS_1258898] of the estimated 14 million Americans who 
abuse or  are dependent upon alcohol.  While men drink alcohol in larger amounts than women do, alcohol -
dependent women often experience greater physical impairment, sooner, once they begin to drink 
heavily.58, 59  Women alcoholics develop alcohol -related liver dis ease, heart disease, and brain disorders 
earlier in their drinking careers than men.  Heavy/ hazardous alcohol use is less likely to be detected in 
women receiving health services.[ADDRESS_1258899] on drinking levels in this at -risk population. These brief interventions ( BI) begin with 
a focused assessment of alcohol and drug use and related problems. Next in a brief, interaction, the 
interventionist 1) provides personalized feedback based on assessment findings (e.g., elevated liver 
function test results or other medical problems, absenteeism or lateness at work, marital distress) 2) 
discusses pros/cons of drinking and 3) offers specific drinking reduction strategies, such as goal setting for 
"sensible" drinking..   
A recent Cochrane Review of the BI literature has confirm ed its overall effectiveness in reducing 
alcohol intake63 and long -term consequences of hazardous alcohol use, especially in men.  Booster phone 
calls reinforcing intervention content have also been shown to improve efficacy of BI; however, the key 
implica tion noted in this review was that more evaluative research on women and minorities was needed .   
Manwell and colleagues64 presented long -term results of a randomized clinical trial of BI for hazardous 
drinking women of childbearing age (i.e., averaged mor e than 11 drinks/week; reported heavy drinking 
[more than 4 drinks/occasion] during the preceding month; or reported 2 or more symptoms on the CAGE).   
Out of almost 6,000 women screened in 17 primary care clinics, 12% met the definition of problem 
drinkin g.  The intervention consisted of two physician -delivered sessions.. Overall, there were significant 
reductions in average weekly drinking and binge drinking in the intervention group compared to the control 
group.  Specifically, a 47% reduction in mean dr inks/week (14.1 to 7.5) occurred within [ADDRESS_1258900] month 
decreased from 93% to 68% of the sample and there was a corresponding reduction in the number of binge 
drinking epi[INVESTIGATOR_7304] 5.[ADDRESS_1258901] drinks consumed 
(14.2 -drink reduction versus 5.1), number of drinking days (3.4 -day reduction versus 1.2), and number of 
heavy drinking days** (1.8 -day reduction versus 0.5;).[ADDRESS_1258902] 
that while brief and effective, t hese interventions do require clinical and staff resources that may lead to 
difficulty in translation to “real -world” clinical settings.   
3.j. Computer -Directed Interventions  
One alternative approach to counselor - or health practitioner -delivered interventions is computer -directed 
BI.  Computer -directed BIs offer tremendous advantages in reducing the multiple barriers that to -date have 
impeded translation of brief interventions  from research studies to clinical practice , even though such 
approaches cannot replicate the human elements of traditional interventions. Specifically, they offer 
tremendous advantages in terms of:  Reach (computer -based interventions (CBIs) can be econom ically and 
 
 
JHMIRB eF ormA   01 
Version 3 Dated:   06/2007   
Page 7 of 38 
 quickly implemented with large groups of patients); Replicability (CBIs offer perfect replication so that 
fidelity monitoring is no longer necessary); Anonymity (our team and others have shown patients are more 
willing to disclose sensitive info rmation to a computer67) Flexibility (range of strategies can be 
“programmed” and matched to patient characteristics with empi[INVESTIGATOR_3675] -derived decision rules); 
Functionality (software can be modified quickly and easily (as proposed in the current grant appl ication); 
Cost and Time (single touch screen laptop can intervene with thousands of patients annually with little time 
and effort from busy medical staff); and Rigor (replicability is at the core of CBIs).    
3.k. The Motivation Enhancement System (MES)  
Drs. Svikis (Consultant) and Ondersma have developed a specific computer -directed screening and 
intervention program that targets substance use in individuals identified through medical settings.  The 
intervention component of MES is based primarily on Motiv ational Interviewing principles68, which are 
themselves derived from a range of conceptual models, including Decisional Balance theory;69 ;Self -
Perception theory;70 and Self -Regulation theory.71  The core components of the BI/MES that assist clients 
in reducing/abstaining from alcohol are to: 1) create dissonance between the client identified costs and 
benefits of drinking and 2) develop client generated methods to address drinking triggers there fore building 
self-efficacy to change behavior. The goal of the MES is to facilitate self -change and/or treatment 
engagement via a single intervention session. It consists of screening, assessment and intervention modules 
which are presented using a Tablet  PC (a laptop computer with an integrated touch screen).  
 The screening component requires [ADDRESS_1258903] pertinent information.  No 
keyboarding is required; all answers are provided by [CONTACT_898155] a list or by [CONTACT_354133] a visual 
analogue scale.  A mobile three -dimensional cartoon character (Peedy the Parrot) is capable of over 50 
specific animated actions and does the “t alking” for the entire program.  Peedy the Parrot reads each item 
for the participant, acts as narrator and guide throughout the process, and provides occasional comic relief. 
Participants listen to Peedy via headphones to ensure privacy.  The MES is thus completely private and 
requires no computer or reading literacy; and in studies to -date, participants have consistently given it near -
perfect ratings for ease of use. For those who screen positive for alcohol/drug risk, the assessment 
component requires 20 -30 minutes to complete and obtains detailed information about smoking, drinking 
and drug use (recent and lifetime) and problems associated with use. It also obtains baseline estimates of a 
patient’s level of interest and motivation to change substance use  as well as the extent to which the person 
feels he/she can make a change.         
 Research to -date with MES has targeted primarily post -partum women. The intervention 
component, presented as a 20 -minute “Patient Health Check -Up”., consists of three compo nents:  (a) 
feedback regarding substance use, the negative consequences of substance use reported by [CONTACT_2299], 
and the participant’s self -reported readiness to change; (b) elicitation of the pros and cons of substance use 
and related change, in whic h the participant chooses from a list of options the positive and negative aspects 
of the substance use for them; and (c) a summary and query regarding the participant’s interest in change, 
followed by [CONTACT_898156] -setting regarding their substance use (a nd provision of a menu of change options/ 
strategies). Throughout the intervention Peedy (the animated parrot narrator) “reflects” back the 
participant’s answers and helps to establish a constructive atmosphere in which the participant can consider 
the pos sibility of behavior change.   
 Based on human factors research and experiences from earlier NIDA -funded software development, 
the MES software was designed to meet five primary requirements.  First, flexibility was paramount in 
order to minimize the time and cost of future modifications.  Second, the MES had to have a “clean” 
appearance, with minimal distractions, a small number of total colors, and an expressive narrator/guide.  
Third, the MES had to be easy to use for persons at any level of reading or c omputer literacy; this meant 
that all instructions, questions, answers, and interactions had to be presented aurally as well as visually.  
Fourth, the MES had to replicate the key elements of a traditional brief intervention as much as possible.  
Fifth and  finally, the MES had to be brief in order to fit easily within the health care setting.  
 
3.l. Summary and Significance of MES to the Proposed RCT  
 
 
JHMIRB eF ormA   01 
Version 3 Dated:   06/[ADDRESS_1258904] been found to highly correlate with blood alcohol 
concentration and reports from a cohabitating partner.77 Generally, for the manag ement of alcohol use 
disorders, IVR has been used as a means of daily self -report of drinking and has been found to be 
associated with overall decreases in alcohol consumption.78 Recently, IVR was tested in an HIV setting 
where 31 hazardous drinking HIV in fected individuals received a brief alcohol intervention followed by 
[CONTACT_898157] -monitoring and feedback (graphical display of drinking) at 30 days.  The 
authors found the intervention to be feasible among this population, and an overall  reduction in alcohol use 
although due to the nature of the study there was no control group.79 While this study did not use IVR for 
personalized counseling/tailored counseling, it did demonstrate the feasibility of using IVR among 
hazardous drinking HIV+ persons.  
3.n. Text messaging and its use among hazardous drinking individuals  
The use of text messaging has risen dramatically in the past five years, with ¾ of the US adults using text 
messaging with a median of 10 texts per day (Pew Internet. http://www. pewinternet.org/Reports/2011/Cell -
Phone -Texting -2011.aspx)  
Using short messaging services (SMS) technology, text messages can be sent to participants to reinforce 
content from behavioral interventions. To date, text messaging has been used to support smoki ng cessation, 
weight loss, medication adherence, and diabetes management (Fledjsoe 2009). In a recent pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], 
Weitzel et al investigated the use of tailored text messages to reduce alcohol related consequences among 
college students. Among 40 particip ants, those randomized to the text messaging group reported 
significantly fewer drinks per drinking day during the study period. These results demonstrate preliminary 
feasibility of delivering alcohol related interventions via text messages and the rationa le for further testing 
text messaging counseling among hazardous drinking individuals.  
3.0 STI Clinics as a venue for intervention  
Brief HIV/STI prevention counseling delivered at the Baltimore and other STI clinics has been 
effective in reducing HIV risk  behaviors and STIs;80, 81 however there is a need to integrate sex and 
substance abuse risk reduction programs since these two behaviors are so frequently associated.82-84 Data 
from our clinic (in studies C.2.1) and others suggest that these patients have  high rates of hazardous alcohol 
use and that this is associated with sexual risk behaviors and STIs.85, 86  Thus, testing the effectiveness of a 
combined alcohol and sexual risk reduction intervention is more feasible in a setting where rates of 
behaviors are high and where STIs can feasibly be diagnosed.  As STIs are irrefutable biomarkers of high 
risk sexual  behavior or  linkage to a high risk sexual network an STI diagnosis can validate self -reported 
behavioral change and is a surrogate marker of behavioral risk reduction 87.  Importantly, the feasibility and 
 
 
JHMIRB eF ormA   01 
Version 3 Dated:   06/[ADDRESS_1258905], it tailors the intervention to enhance the cultural and so cial 
relevance of the content to more effectively engage this vulnerable population of urban women. Fourth, it 
implements the intervention in a STI clinic, a potentially important venue for delivering such care given the 
overrepresentation of alcohol and s exual risk behaviors in this setting.  Finally, computer -directed BI and 
telephone counseling through IVR/text messaging offer a low -cost, efficient means of intervention delivery 
with high potential for widespread dissemination.   
 
3.p. Preliminary Studie s 
Representative Research Findings Relevant to the Proposed Research.   The following paragraphs 
highlight some of the research contributions of various members of our research team and demonstrate our 
group’s history of collaboration and expertise and abil ity to successfully complete the proposed research  
 
3.p.1. Gender, binge drinking, high risk sex, and sexually transmitted infections (Hutton, McCaul, 
Erbelding) We examined the association between binge drinking and risky sexual behaviors/STIs among 
patie nts attending the STI Clinics of the Baltimore City Health Department (BCHD). A total of 671 STI 
clinic patients were tested for STIs, and 
queried about recent alcohol/drug use and 
risky sexual behaviors using audio 
computer -assisted -self-interview. The 
association between binge drinking and 
sexual behaviors/STIs was analyzed using 
logistic regression adjusting for age, 
employment, and drug use. Binge drinking 
was reported by 30% of women and 42% 
of men. 21% reported having sex while 
drinking. Gender differ ences were found in 
rates of receptive anal sex which increased 
linearly with increased alcohol use among 
women but did not differ among men (see 
Figure 1). Within gender analyses showed that women binge drinkers engaged in anal sex at more than 
twice the rate of women who drank alcohol without binges (33.3% vs. 15.9%; p < 0.05) and 3 times the rate 
of women who abstained from alcohol (11.1%; p < 0.05). Having multiple sex partners was more than 
twice as common among women binge drinkers than women abstaine rs (40.5% vs. 16.8%; p < 0.05). 
Gonorrhea was nearly 5 times higher among women binge drinkers compared to women abstainers (10.6% 
vs. 2.2%; p < 0.05). The association between binge drinking and sexual behaviors/gonorrhea remained after 
controlling for dru g use. Among men, rates of risky sexual behaviors/STIs were high, but did not differ by 
[CONTACT_704944]. Rates of binge drinking among STI clinic patients were high. Among women, binge drinking 
was uniquely associated with risky sexual behaviors and an STI dia gnosis. These findings support the need 
to routinely screen for binge drinking as part of clinical care in STI clinics. Women binge drinkers, in 
particular, may benefit from interventions that jointly address binge drinking and risky sexual behaviors. 
Deve lopi[INVESTIGATOR_898128] -specific interventions could improve overall health outcomes in this population.98  
ACASI vs. Face -to-Face Interview: Assessing Response Bias  
Another substudy  in the same BCHD STI clinic population (N=669) demonstrated the feasibility of using 
an ACASI -formatted survey, and its superiority to face to face interviews (FFI) as a data collection tool for 

 
 
JHMIRB eF ormA   01 
Version 3 Dated:   06/2007   
Page 10 of 38 
 sensitive sexual risk behaviors (61). All participants initi ally underwent ACASI, and subsequently a FFI. A 
series of questions on illicit drug use and sexual risk behaviors were asked. In comparing responses to 
similar questions between the two interview modes (FFI compared to using the ACASI), participants 
report ed 1) sensitive sexual behaviors such as same sex contact, receptive rectal sexual exposure, orogenital 
contact, and 2) a greater number of sex partners in the last month more frequently with the ACASI.  The 
study demonstrated that patient reporting of sen sitive sexual risk behaviors (same sex contact, exchange of 
drugs/money for sex, number of sexual partners in the month) in FFI was highly susceptible to social 
desirability bias. We concluded that the ACASI might be a more reliable assessment method for r eporting 
of sexual behaviors than face -on interviews with the STI clinician and that use of the ACASI within this 
setting was feasible.99 This study, which was conducted on the same population that will be recruited for 
this proposal highlights the importa nce of including ACASI to minimize the extent of response bias among 
the participants.  
 
3.p.2 Alcohol use remains prevalent among women attending an urban STI clinic and is associated 
with risky sex (Chander, Hutton, Finklestein, McCaul, Erbelding). We rec ently (July 2008) conducted 
a pi[INVESTIGATOR_268106] 200 women attending the BCHD STI Clinic to determine the prevalence of alcohol 
use.  Participants were recruited from the waiting area and through flyers handed out by [CONTACT_898158].  Alcohol use  was queried through the AUDIT -C.  In this sample 88% of women were AA, 27% had 
less than a high school education, 34% graduated from high school, and the remaining 40% had some 
college or greater. Among this sample, the overall prevalence of any alcohol u se was 57%; 25% reported 
binge drinking (≥ 4 drinks per occasion) and 29% met NIAAA criteria for hazardous drinking (> 7 drinks 
per week or ≥ 4 drinks per occasion).  52% of women had a score of 3 or greater on the AUDIT -C, 
reflecting hazardous alcohol use . Overall, 38% of women had risky sex, defined as either 1) a diagnosis of 
a sexually transmitted infection at the time of the survey or 2) reporting unprotected anal or vaginal 
intercourse while high. Binge drinking (Adjusted OR: 2.04 [95% CI:0.99 -4.26], hazardous use (AOR: 2.10 
[1.01 -4.35]) and a positive AUDIT -C (AOR:2.54 (1.28 -5.03) were all associated with high risk sexual 
behaviors even after adjusting for age, race, education, and illicit drug use. These findings affirm that binge 
drinking and hazard ous alcohol use continue to be problems in the STI clinic setting.  Further, the study 
confirms the team’s ability to recruit patients from the STI clinic lobby [CONTACT_898159].  
 
3.p.3 Cell phone use is more common than inter net use among women attending an urban STI Clinic .  
In the same pi[INVESTIGATOR_898129], women 
were asked about their cell phone and internet 
use.  Of those surveyed, 93% used cell phones 
(Table 1). Neither alcohol nor drug use were 
associated with cell phone use.  In contrast to 
the high percentage of cell phone use, only 48% 
of women used the internet once per week or 
greater.  Not surprisingly, some college or 
graduate school (AOR: 5.13 (2.22 -11.85)) and a 
high school degree (AOR: 2.71 (2.25 -6.39) 
were associated with an increased o dds of 
internet use compared to those with less than a 
high school education, while older age was 
associated with decreased internet use. Women 
were also asked if they would be interested in 
receiving health advice over the telephone 
(either cell phone or text messaging). Sixty nine 
percent of women stated they would be 
interested. These data demonstrate that cell Table 1:Cell Phone and Internet Use Among 200

 phones use is widespread within this population and suggests that interventions via cell phone may be more 
accessible to urban women with low lev els of internet use. Moreover, the majority of women surveyed 
stated that they would be interested in receiving health advice delivered by a cell -phone.  
3.p.4 Randomized Trial of Brief Alcohol Interventions Among HIV -Infected Women  (McCaul, 
Chander, & Hutt on). In this RCT (R01 AA14500),  hazardous/binge drinking HIV infected women 
receiving care in the Johns Hopkins HIV clinic were  randomized to a therapi[INVESTIGATOR_898130].  All participants undergo an ACASI interview at 0, 3, 6, & 12 months and 
those randomized to the intervention receive d a brief alcohol intervention + 2 booster phone calls . 
Outcome measures include d: alcohol/drug use, engagement in substance abuse treatment services, HIV -risk 
behaviors, HIV disease markers and medication adherence, and psychiatric symptoms.  Early testing of our 
BI curriculum revealed the participants’ observation that their heavy drinking was often a “trigger” for 
having sex that was not typi[INVESTIGATOR_2855] (e.g. rougher sex, casual sex, or unp rotected sex). This underscored the 
importance of targeting the combination of sex and alcohol use in future risk reduction applications.  
 
3.p.5 Development and Pi[INVESTIGATOR_898131] -Delivered Screening and Brief Intervention 
Software (Ondersma, Chase , Svikis, & Schuster, 2005). This three -study series was conducted to 
determine the acceptability and preliminary efficacy of a computer -based brief motivational intervention 
(the Motivation Enhancement System, or MES).100, [ADDRESS_1258906] -intervention and at one -month follow -up (d = .49). These preliminary results were 
encouraging and suggested that further work in this area was warranted.

Women (Ondersma, Svikis, & Schuster, 2007).   This randomized trial built upon the successful 
development work cited above, and was based on the principle that implement ation of brief interventions 
with this population could be greatly facilitated by [CONTACT_22123] -based interventions.[ADDRESS_1258908]-partum women recruited from an urban obstetric hospi[INVESTIGATOR_898132] a low -income population. 
Women were rand omized into assessment only vs. assessment plus brief intervention conditions; 76 (71%) 
returned for follow -up evaluation, with the intervention being a 20 -minute, single -session computer -based 
brief motivational session (based on Motivational Interviewing  methods) combined with two non -tailored 
mailings. At four -month follow -up, the frequency of illicit drug use other than marijuana increased slightly 
for the control group, but declined among intervention group participants ( p < .05, between -groups Mann -
Whitney U; d = .50); the magnitude of intervention effects on changes in marijuana use frequency was 
similar, but did not reach statistical significance. Point -prevalence analysis at follow -up did not show 
significant group differences in drug use. However, trends under a range of assumptions regarding 
participants lost to follow -up all favored the intervention group, with most effect sizes in the moderate 
range (OR’s 1.4 to 4.7).  Alcohol use was not the primary outcome of this study. However, among this 
samp le, there was also significantly less alcohol use at a level of weekly or greater among the intervention 
group (7%) versus the control group (29%).  Adjusting for baseline alcohol use, in logistic regression, the 
control group had a significantly lower odd s of consuming alcohol less than weekly (compared to weekly 
or greater) than the intervention group (OR: 0.162).  These results supported the efficacy of this high -reach, 
replicable brief intervention and demonstrate the research team’s ability to conduct RCTs using MES in 
medical settings.  Since a “standard care, no treatment” control group was not included, effect sizes may 
be conservative as research suggests the assessment only condition may have served as an intervention, 
leading to greater reductions  in substance than expected with routine practice.      
 
3.p.7 Interactive Voice Response Technology (Finkelstein)  [CONTACT_495463] has significant experience in

Version 3 Dated:   06/[ADDRESS_1258909] with a computer 
using the keypad or voice response system. One study with high relevance to this proposal carried out 
usability testing of two automated home -based systems designed to monitor patients' health status and 
improve self -care. 103 TLC -DietAid, an IVR system that uses computer telephony to carry out totally 
automated telephone conversations with patient users, monitors dietary behavior of dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035] 
(cholesterolemia) patients in their homes and provides them with nutrition information, advice, and 
behavioral counseling, principally to lower saturated fat in their diets and thus lower low -density 
lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL -C) in their sera. During wee kly conversations, TLC -DietAid speaks to 
patients over the telephone using computer -controlled digitized human speech. The patients, in turn, 
communicate with TLC -DietAid using the touch -tone keypad of their telephones. In usual practice, patients 
call TLC -DietAid once a week, however, for this evaluation study they used it every day for [ADDRESS_1258910] between 5 and 10 min, depending on the number or complexity of the topi[INVESTIGATOR_898133]'s responses. After each conversation,  TLC stores the information recorded by 
[CONTACT_221816] a database, for use in tailoring future conversations. The systems were evaluated in two separate 
qualitative studies.104 The qualitative analysis  
uncovered "medium -specific" and "content -specific" issues that addressed either the process of the 
interaction or its content. The results demonstrated that patient -users tended to evaluate each system on the 
basis of how it fit into everyday life and corr esponded to personal preferences. The methodology also 
allowed the system designers to understand users' concerns and the context of adoption in order to design 
changes to address such concerns. This study demonstrates [CONTACT_495463]’s ability to design a nd 
implement an IVR system, and his use of qualitative methods to modify the system. An important finding 
from this work was that users evaluated the system on its compatibility with their lives. Because cell phone 
use is prevalent in our proposed sample ( 93% surveyed used cell phones), this mode of intervention 
delivery may be particularly acceptable and may be more accessible to individuals who may not regularly 
access the health care system..

3. Summary  
Hazardous/binge alcohol use is prevalent among women attending Baltimore City STI clinics and 
associated with particularly high risk behaviors: unprotected sex, multiple sex partners, and anal 
intercourse .  The MES system, based on the principle s of motivational interviewing, offers an innovative, 
and replicable means of delivering brief alcohol/STI interventions among the vulnerable population of 
HIV-infected and HIV -at risk women.  Enhancement of this intervention with cell -phone based telephon e 
counseling using IVR and text messaging has the potential to reach individuals who may not routinely 
engage regular health care.  The investigative team brings a depth and diversity of experience that will 
allow them to tailor the MES, IVR and text messa ging intervention delivery systems and content to the 
target study population of urban women.  
 
4.Study Procedures  
All procedures are for research purposes only.  
4.a. Study design ,  
4.a.1. Overview of Study Design : 
We propose a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of computer -delivered BI and telephone booster calls 
using interactive voice technology and text messaging for hazardous/binge drinking women seeking care 
for  sexually transmitted infections in the Baltimore City Health Department STI Clinic (BCHD STI) 
(N=450).  The arms of the RCT will reflect three levels of intervention: 1) usual care/attention control, 2) 
clinic -based, computer -delivered, brief alcohol intervention, and 3) clinic -based, computer -delivered,  brief 
alcohol intervention + 3 booster calls using IVR supplemented with counseling text messages. The primary 
outcomes will be measured at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 month intervals and will include alcohol -related risk 
behaviors (number of binge drinking ep isodes, drinking days/ week , and drinks per occasion), sexual risk 
behaviors (number of partners, and number of unprotected vaginal and/or anal sex occasions, sex while 
high), and occurrence of STI biomarkers.  See Study Design Overview Below

Version 3 Dated:   06/[ADDRESS_1258913] STI clinic of the BHCD  
processes over 12,000 Clinic patient visits per year (Table  5).   
The majority of patients who use the BCHD STI 
Clinics seek epi[INVESTIGATOR_898138], syphilis, HIV, and chlamydial infections 
but also for other STIs such as trichomonas, non -
gonococcal urethritis, herpes simplex virus infections, 
and human p api[INVESTIGATOR_27509] (HPV) infections.  The 
Eastern STI Clinic is easily accessible to public 
transportation services, and is located in high 
prevalence areas for STIs and HIV infection.  The 
clinic is staffed by [ADDRESS_1258914] HIV 
counseling.  The clinics operate Monday through 
Friday, 8:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.  Individuals attend the 
clinic on a “walk -in, first -come, first served” basis 
and are assigned an appointment time for that day as 
they register. Clinicians are trained to provide HIV 
prevention counseling to all patients within their 
clinical encounter so that care is delivered according 
to an integrated HIV/ STI treatment and prevention 
model. Our study focuses on women seeking STI 
services within this setting.  Characteristics of the 
population are described in the Table. Forty seven percent of visits are made by [CONTACT_898163] 5% are HIV 
infected.  
 
4.a.3 . Recruit ment  
We plan to screen 1800 women receiving care at the BCHD STD Clinic over 30 months with the goal 
of recruiting approximately 15 women per month. Study participants will be identified by [CONTACT_898164].  
1) Women registering in the BCHD STI clinic will be  given a standard form with the following question: 
“Have often in the last year have you had more than three drinks of alcohol on one occasion ?” This 
form has already been integrated into the routine registration procedures at the Druid Hill STD Clinic, 
and will be added to the procedures at Eastern STD Clinic. This form will be reviewed by [CONTACT_594754], and for those women who h ave had more than three alcoholic drinks on one occasion 
in the past year, a sticker will be placed on  the form asking the provider to discuss referral to the study 
with the patient. This form will be included in the registration packet given to clinicians  irrespective of 
the patient’s drinking status .   
2) Flyers will be posted in the clinic waiting room.  
3) Participants  will be recruited by [CONTACT_267814]. In addition to screening for alcohol use at 
registration, providers in the STD clinic ask all patie nts the following two questions as part of routine 
clinical care. These questions are integrated into the electronic medical record/standard history and 
physical form used at all patient encounters: 1) “In the last month: have you had sex when you were 
intoxicated on alcohol? 2) “In the last one month: Have you had more than 3 drinks on one occasion?” 
If a woman answers yes to either of these questions, providers may refer her for screening.  Tabl e 5: Demographic Characteristics BCHD

 4) Waiting room recruitments: a table will be set up in the waitin g room of the STD clinics where a 
research assistant will be seated with flyers advertising the study. The research assistant will follow a 
standard script that asks if a participant would like to screened for a study examining a computer delivered 
interve ntion to focusing on healthier behaviors (see attached script in supplemental study documents). In 
the waiting room, there will be no mention of alcohol or sexual risk behaviors. If a woman is willing to 
undergo screening, she will be taken to a private ro om, where more information can be given about the 
study, as well as screening and consent.  In the event that a table is not available, a research assistant will 
be seated in the waiting room with recruitment flyers and any discussion of the study will onl y include 
information detailed on the attached script.  
4.a.[ADDRESS_1258915] the effectiveness of 
a computer -delivered brief intervention (with or without follow -up phone calls) among women with 
hazardous alcohol use.  They will be informed that they will be randomly assigned to 1 of 3 study 
conditions (usual care, computer -directed brief alcohol intervention, or computer -directed brief alcohol 
intervention + booster phone calls) and that they may choose to leave t he study at any time without 
compromising their health care at the BCHD. They will also be informed that if they consent to the study, 
they will participate in [ADDRESS_1258916] a confidentiality certificate administered by [CONTACT_205282]. After the consent form is reviewed, the participant will be asked questions regarding the 
consent form reflecting key study procedures, including randomization,  for example, 1) what is the purpose 
of the study? 2) What are the study risks? 3) How will study group be determined? 4) What will be done to 
protect her confidentiality. The participant must answer all of these questions correctly to ensure adequate 
understanding of the consent form. If questions are not answered correctly, the research assistant will 
review the study procedures unti l the participant demonstrates understanding.  
We will not be enrolling women who do not speak English. Because the intervention has an audio 
component, we will not be enrolling individuals who are hearing impaired.   
 
4.a.5 Screening  and Eligibility : 
Women will be screened for the study in  a private o ffice in the BCHD STD Clinic. We anticipate screening 
1800 women, with 25% meeting study eligibility. The screening will be comprised of the following 
questions to determine study eligibility.  
 
1) Age 
2) Patient of the BCHD STD Clinic  
3) Quick Drinking Screen  (a measure of daily quantity and weekly frequency of alcohol use)  
4) Sex while under the influence of alcohol in the past 3 months  
5) Sexually active with men  
6) Pregnant  
7) Able to speak and read English  
8) Currently enrolled in alcohol treatment  
9) Own a cell phone  
10) Uses text messaging  
11) Not moving out of the area in the next 12 months.

Women who are ineligible for the study will receive $5 .00 for their time. Women who are eligible for the 
study will participate in the baseline assessment described below in section 4.a. 8. 
 
4.a.6. Randomization  
After women undergo their baseline assessment they will be randomized to one of three study arms: 1 ) 
Computerized Brief Intervention (CBI) + Cell phone counseling/text messages 2) CBI only 3) Attention 
Control/Usual Care. Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_898165] .  
4.a.7. Study Arms  
Attention Control/Usual Care  
An attention control arm has been created for this study to ensure that intervention effects are not a result of 
the increased attention one receives from participating in behavioral interventions. For participants 
randomized to the attention control arm t he RA will record their group assignment and bring Peedy the 
Parrot onto the screen.  They will then participate in computer -delivered informational intervention on oral 
health. Specifically, individuals will watch a series of videos on the importance of b rushing and flossing 
teeth. In addition, they will receive educational information on gingivitis, gum disease, links between gum 
disease and overall health. Finally they will receive instruction on how to properly brush and floss teeth.  
The rationale for including dental information in the attention control arm is that poor oral hygiene has 
been identified as a major public health problem in Baltimore City.  
 
Participants in all three arms will receive a “Healthy Woman” pamphlet that includes local resourc es 
including a comprehensive list of federally qualified health centers in Baltimore City and local resources 
for free dental care, psychiatric care, primary medical care, substance abuse treatment programs (including 
tobacco), AA and NA meetings, and dome stic violence.  This will be submitted to the IRB once it is 
complete.  
 
Computerized Brief Intervention  
Women randomized to either the CDI + IVR/text or CBI only will receive the computer -delivered brief 
intervention targeting alcohol use and risky sexual b ehaviors. Participants will interact with the computer 
via Peedy, a three dimensional animated character. Peedy the Parrot has been found in previous research to 
be well -understood and well -liked. The 20 -minute intervention will be delivered as an ACASI, w ith 
participants listening to Peedy using headphones. The computerized intervention will focus on 1) providing 
feedback on the participants alcohol use and HIV risk behaviors, 2) emphasizing personal responsibility for 
change, 3) providing clear advice to change risky behaviors, 4) providing a menu of options for change, 5) 
using empathy as a counseling style, and 6) enhancing self -efficacy. The MES is heavily based on 
 
 
JHMIRB eF ormA   01 
Version 3 Dated:   06/2007   
Page 18 of 38 
 Motivational Interviewing principles.68 It thus includes traditional motivationally -orien ted intervention 
components: feedback, pros and cons, and optional goal -setting. The MES tailors more thoroughly on 
present willingness to change. Thus, the above components are primarily presented to participants who are 
unwilling to initiate a change att empt. Those who are willing move directly into optional goal -setting, 
which includes a menu of change options as well as elements normally found in a “change plan worksheet” 
(specification of goals, problem -solving regarding how to address possible obstacl es, etc.). It also provides 
expanded options for additional information, for addressing self -efficacy with participants whose 
willingness is high but confidence is low; and for assistance with relapse prevention —all presented only for 
participants who indi cate interest in this information. The current MES also includes the ability to utilize 
the participant’s first name, following data from Dijsktra108 indicating that just this simple addition results 
in additional perceptions of personal relevance, with co nsequent increases in efficacy. Finally, women will 
be given a brief handout summarizing ways to avoid, cope and escape risky moods and situations 
associated with alcohol use (uploaded as supplemental document).  
 For the present study, these components ha ve been tailored to the target women served by [CONTACT_898166] -depth interviews done with women attending the clinic, and on feedback on the 
intervention after the MES was revised to reflect content from in -depth interviews. For example, the 
benefits of continuing to use alcohol (e.g., social network of alcohol using friends, helps person cope with 
stress, alcohol expectancies, avoidance of withdrawal) will also be discussed in conjunction with the 
benefits of reducing or stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_416236] (e.g., imp roved physical and psychological health, reductions in family 
conflicts and problems, reductions in high risk sexual and drug related behaviors).  Opportunities to look at 
what life will be like five years in the future if the person continues to use alcoh ol as compared to making a 
choice to cut down or stop using alcohol are provided.  Finally, participants have the chance to set goals to 
reduce or stop using alcohol either on their own or with assistance from AA, or another substance abuse 
program of thei r choice.  The CBI script that was programmed into the MES software is attached as an 
appendix to this proposal.  
 
CBI + Booster phone calls using Interactive Voice Response Technology (IVR) and text messaging  
This enhanced CBI arm, will use the MES -delivered brief intervention described above and be 
followed by [CONTACT_898167].  The booster calls will occur 2, 4, and [ADDRESS_1258919]. Finkelstein (Co -I).  This computer -based telecommunications system uses computer telephony to carry 
out automated telephone conversations wi th patient users.  The system is programmed with branching logic 
that responds to the respondents answer to a particular question. The system speaks to patients over the 
telephone using computer -controlled digitized human speech.  Individuals randomized to  this arm of the 
trial will be given, instructions, and the schedule for their receiving calls from study staff.   
IVR Procedures : When a woman is called through the IVR system, the woman is asked to enter the 
last 4 digits of her social security number to  verify her identity. Once her identity is confirmed, she will 
then undergo the counseling session.  
 Intervention content for booster phone calls : Content of the calls is based on content from the CBI. 
Women will be asked if they met their goals for safer alcohol use and safer sex, and based on their 
response, they will be branched into different counseling algorithms. The duration of the call is 5 minutes.  
The content of the call which has been programmed into the IVR is attached to this application as an  
appendix.  
Text message boosters   
Text messages will be delivered over 6 weeks. Participants randomized to this arm will be informed that 
they will be receiving these text messages. Text messages will be sent in the morning and evening and on 
weekends. The  content of the texts is theory based. Individuals will receive three text messages per week

from other drug use or illness, the research interview will be rescheduled.  Subjects will receive bus tokens 
or cab fare to facilitate their transportation to and from their appointments.  
 
Assessment instruments were sele cted to balance the need for study data across several outcome domains 
with the length and duration of the data collection.  Since assessment alone can modify behavior, it is 
important to reduce the length/intensity of the assessment battery.   
 
The follow ing assessments will be performed. The baseline and follow -up assessments are uploaded as 
supplemental study documents to this proposal.

* The Time Line Follow Back Interview may be audiotaped for fidelity checks.  
 
a) Demographics and Sexual History : Participants will be asked a range of demographic questions 
including their age, race -ethnicity, highest grade in school,  marital status, employment, income, housing 
status, age of sexual debut, prior history of STI, sexual  orientation, pregnancy history  
 
b) Alcohol/Drug Use/Sexual Behaviors : The Time -line Follow -back will be used to obtain a detailed recent 
history of alcohol and drug use and sexual risk behaviors. Using structured interview prompts, the TLFB 
quantifies alcohol, and drug use and sexual activity on each day during the last th irty days. TLFB yields 
detailed quantity/frequency data including type of alcohol consumed, number of drinking days, mean 
number of drinks/drinking day, and number of binge drinking days, type of drug use, quantity and 
frequency of use and number of drug u sing days. Sexual risk behaviors that will be queried will include the 
number of sexual encounters in the 30days, types of sexual encounters (main or casual or exchange), type 
of intercourse (anal, oral, vaginal), condom use, sex while high, and drug and a lcohol use by [CONTACT_898168] .  
 
c) Alcohol/sex expectancies  will be measured using a modified version of the Revised Alcohol Expectancy 
Questionnaire122, 123. Items are rated on a scale of 1 ( disagree strongly ) to 6 ( agree strongly ). An example 
includes “I enjoy having sex more if I've had some alcohol”  
 
d)Psychological distress :  will be assessed based on the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) for depression, 
panic, and anxiety (GAD -7) 
 
e) Readiness to Change  will be assessed using readiness rulers .  
 
f) Alcohol Treatment Entry : Admission to off -site alcoholism treatment programs and engagement in 
Alcoholics Anonymous or Narcotics Anonymous will be assessed during the follow -up interviews  
 
g)  Breath Alcohol Concentration  (BAC) will be obtained usin g an Alcosensor IV.  
 
h) Urine Pregnancy Testing: Urine pregnancy testing will occur at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months. Urine 
pregnancy testing is performed on -site by [CONTACT_898169].  
 
i) Urine toxicology specimens .  The  following drug classes will be included: opi[INVESTIGATOR_858] (methadone, 
buprenorphine, morphine, dilaudid, codeine, demerol); sedatives/ tranquilizers (barbiturates and 
 
 
JHMIRB eF ormA   01 
Version 3 Dated:   06/2007   
Page 21 of 38 
 benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651]); stimulants (amphetamine and cocaine); and marijuana.  Urine specimens will be 
collected at screening and each follow -up visit.  
 
j) Gonorrhea and Chlamydia : Urine STI testing will occur at baseline and 3, 6, and 12 months after intake, 
and at all voluntary (unscheduled) clinic visits.  We will record whether STI infection occurs at ea ch of 
these visits, as well as reason for presentation at voluntary visits. Urine specimens will be obtained and 
tested for urine gonorrhea and Chlamydia using the Gen Probe. The Gen -Probe APTIMA Combo 2 (Gen -
Probe, San Diego, CA) assay detects both C. tra chomatis  and N. gonorrhea . The test is highly sensitive and 
specific for the detection of both organisms and is comparable to a cervical swab collected by a clinician. 
Urine STI testing is performed by [CONTACT_898170].  
 
k) Rapid HIV testing will per performe d using the OraQuick Advance Rapid HIV1/[ADDRESS_1258921] at baseline, 3, 6 and at 12 month follow -up. This testing is offered 
routinely in the BCHD STI Clinic to all individuals presenting for an STI exam. Women agree able to HIV 
testing will be referred to the HIV testing and counseling services in the BCHD STD clinic. Testing will 
not be done by [CONTACT_20240]. Permission to obtain results of rapid HIV testing performed by [CONTACT_898171].  
 
l). HIV medication adherence : Among persons with HIV, this will be assessed using an ART Adherence 
Visual analog scale and an ART Persistence Questionnaire.  
 
m) Medical record abstraction : At the time of consent we will obtain permission to access participant’s 
BCHD medical record. We will review the medical record at baseline and at their twelve month follow -up 
to determine past STIs, contraception use, and pregnancy. For those who are HIV infected, we will access 
the medical r ecord to collect CD4, HIV -RNA and use of antiretrovirals.  
 
O) Phosphatidylethanol (PEth ):[ADDRESS_1258922] ethanol metabolite that is detectable in the blood for more than 2 weeks after sustained ethanol intake. This will 
be collected on a sub -sample of women enrolled in th e trial to validate self -reported alcohol consumption . 
Participation will be volun tary and we will obtain separate consent for this .  PEth has been shown to be a sensitive 
and specific marker for recent alcohol consumption. We anticipate collecting this bi omarker on approximately 60 
women. Collection occurs via finger -stick using Lancet . Participants providing a blood sample for PEth will receive 
$5.[ADDRESS_1258923] previously been successful in obtaining consent and research participation from individuals 
attending the BCHD STI Clinic. In our previous study, a subset of i ndividuals was invited to undergo a 
SCID interview.  Of those consenting for study and who completed initial interview (N=671), 233 agreed 
to SCID  interview and 201 (86%) returned to complete it. In other studies (see Appendix 3) taking place in 
the BCHD STI clinics, recruitment has generally exceeded projected numbers and retention has ranged 
from 71 -95% . In our trial of BI among HIV -infected AA women, follow -up rates to date have exceeded 
93%. Based on our prior research experience, and our extensive fo llow-up procedures detailed below, we 
expect to achieve research follow -up rates exceeding 75% at 12 months.   
 Follow -up assessments will be scheduled at the time of enrollment and confirmed prior to, and at 
each follow -up assessment visit. To optimize fo llow-up rates at all assessment time points (3, 6, & 12 
months) we will follow a standard protocol.  At the time of enrollment, a participant tracking form will be 
filled out, which includes the participants primary contact [CONTACT_3031] (address, telephone number), 
 
 
JHMIRB eF ormA   01 
Version 3 Dated:   06/[ADDRESS_1258924] persons are varied in their type of involvement 
with the participant; that is, a contact [CONTACT_898172] a family member, a social worker, a parole or 
probation officer, or a close personal friend.   
Reminder cards will be mailed two weeks prior to the scheduled appointment, and telephone calls 
(made cell phones a nd alternate contact [CONTACT_15750]) will be made one week, and 24 hours prior to the 
scheduled assessment. In addition, text messages will be sent to remind women of their upcoming 
appointments 24 to 48 hours prior to their scheduled visit, and if a participant agrees, we will email 
appointment reminders. To keep the study “fresh” in the minds of the participants, birthday cards and 
holiday cards will be mailed. Reminder cards and birthday cards will be submitted to the IRB once their 
design is complete.  
In addi tion to our standard protocol for participant tracking and follow -up, we will also be hiring a 
disease intervention specialist (DIS) . DIS are currently used by [CONTACT_898173] -up. Using established BCHD STI clinic procedures for 
tracking and follow -up, the DIS will locate individuals who fail to attend their scheduled follow -up 
assessments and participants who have positive STI tests at a study assessment and are unable to be rea ched 
by [CONTACT_756]. The DIS will first call the individual and if unable to leave a message, will call alternate 
contacts. If unsuccessful, she will conduct a field visit to the home. If no success, she will conduct field 
visits to alternate contact [CONTACT_898174]. If unsuccessful, she will call again at a different time of day, and if no 
return call after [ADDRESS_1258925] during the field visit, the DIS will schedule the next study follow -up. 
 
 
4b.Study duration and number of study visits required of research participant s. 
The study duration is 12 months, with study vi sits occurring at baseline, 3 months, 6 months and 12 
months.  
4c.Blinding  
Because this is a behavioral intervention that involves counseling , participants will not be blinded to their 
study condition; however, research assistants performing the Time Line F ollow Back Interview will be 
blinded to the participant’s assigned study condition, as will the Principle Investigator and Co -
Investigators. The Study coordinator will be aware of group assignment, but will not be assessing patient 
outcomes.  
 
4d. Justific ation o f why participant s will not receive routine  care. 
All participants in the study will receive routine care offered by [CONTACT_898175]. No current therapy 
will be stopped.  
 
4e.Justification for inclusion of a placebo or non -treatment group.  
This study does include an attention control group which will receive all of the usual care provided by [CONTACT_898176], along with computer delivered information of the importance of regular dental care. This us ual 
care group/attention control is included because it is essential to understand the efficacy of the  computer 
delivered brief alcohol intervention alone, compared to usual care. Because not all women will have access 
to cell phones or text messaging, or they may not choose to engage in cell phone based counseling, it is 
important to establish whether a s ingle computer delivered brief alcohol intervention decreases alcohol use 
and high risk sexual behaviors.  In addition, the attention control condition is needed to determine the 
effects of our assessment on participant’s drinking behaviors.

 Participants will only be removed from the study if they become pregnant. The rationale is as follows:  
pregnant women should be referred for more extensive counseling on alcohol use  to prevent alcohol 
exposure to the fetus and Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders.  
 
4g.Description of what happens to participant s receiving therapy when study ends or if a 
participant ’s participation in the study end s prematurely.  
If the study ends prematurely, all enrolled par ticipants will still receive routine care offered by [CONTACT_898177]. Women interested in receiving counseling for alcohol use will be referred to local treatment 
programs and Baltimore City Community Psychiatry.

Version 3 Dated:   06/[ADDRESS_1258928] defined hazardous drinking as >7 drinks per 
week or >3 drinks per occasion (also defined as binge drinking). Our data from the BCHD STI 
clinic indicate that 29% of women drink at hazardous levels. These women are the target 
population for our research.  
Power estimates were derived using existing ACASI data from an earlier study in the STI 
clinic (Prelim Studies C.2.1 & C.2.3) and a recent pi[INVESTIGATOR_898139] 
2008.  Expected intervention effect sizes for alcohol -related outcomes were estimated from 
published studies of computerized BI w ith urban post -partum women ,[ADDRESS_1258929] size with odds ratios from 1.4 to 4.7. Manwell 
and colleagues128  presented long -term results of a randomized clinical trial of BI fo r problem 
drinking women of childbearing age (i.e., averaged more than 11 drinks/week; reported heavy 
drinking [more than 4 drinks during a single drinking epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]] during the preceding month; or 
reported 2 or more symptoms on the CAGE).   Out of almost 6, 000 women screened in 17 
primary care clinics, 12% met the definition of problem drinking.  Overall, there were 
significant reductions in average weekly drinking and binge drinking in the intervention group 
compared to the control group.  Specifically, the re was a 47% reduction in mean drinks per 
week (14.1 to 7.5) that occurred within [ADDRESS_1258930] month decreased from 93% to 68% of 
the sample and there was  a corresponding reduction in the number of binge drinking epi[INVESTIGATOR_898140] 5.[ADDRESS_1258931] sizes for sexual risk behavior outcomes were estimated from 
published studies of sexual risk reduction among individuals in alcoho l treatment, and among 
individuals attending at STI clinic. Avins and colleagues examined sexual risk behaviors before 
and after alcohol treatment among 112 sexual active individuals. 130 In this study, the proportion 
of individuals using condoms consisten tly increased from 22% before treatment to 35% after 
alcohol treatment. Project Respect, a three arm randomized trial, tested behavioral counseling 
(enhanced counseling vs. brief counseling vs. didactic messages only) to reduce STI and risky 
sexual behavio rs.  In this study, both counseling arms demonstrated a decreased incidence of 
STI compared to control group that received didactic messages. Specifically, 149 participants 
(10.4%) in the didactic messages arm had new STDs compared with 103 (7.2%) in the e nhanced 
counseling arm (RR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.54 -0.88) and 107 (7.3%) in the brief counseling arm (RR, 
0.71; 95% CI, 0.58 -0.89). Through the 12 -month visit, 211 participants (14.6%) in the didactic

counseling arm (RR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.64 -0.94) and 173 (12.0%) in the brief counseling arm (RR, 
0.81; 95% CI, 0.67-0.98). The 2 interactive counseling interventions had very similar cumulative 
incidence of STD through the 6 - and 12 -month visits.131  
 
Primary Outcomes  
AIM 1 :  To determine the effectiveness of computer -delivered BI and IVR/text in decreasing 
alcohol risk behaviors among hazardous/binge drinking African/American women attending an 
urban STI Clinic.  
 
Hypothesis 1a : Women r eceiving BI + IVR/text will have fewer binge drinking epi[INVESTIGATOR_898121] (number of standard drinks/week, number of drinking days/week) compared to 
usual care.  
 
Hypothesis 1b : Women receiving BI will have fewer binge drinking epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841] a nd lower alcohol 
consumption (number of standard drinks/week, number of drinking days/week) compared to usual 
care.  
 
Hypothesis 1c: Women receiving BI + IVR will have fewer binge drinking epi[INVESTIGATOR_898121] (number of standard drinks/we ek, number of drinking days/week) compared to 
BI only.  
 
Power Analysis.  For these outcomes, power calculations for a given sample size were derived on the 
basis of maximum effect size to be detected over time between the three study arms assuming a repeate d 
measures analysis (baseline and three follow -up periods) and a balanced design.  The calculation was 
performed for varying sample sizes, three levels of ES (0.2 -, 0.4, and 0.5)[ADDRESS_1258932] size133 three levels of 
rho or within -person correlation between  measurements, and an alpha level of 0.0167 (0.05 experiment -
wise error rate Bonferroni type adjustment134 for three pair -wise hypothesis comparisons at 6 months with 
earlier and later treatment effects tested at an unadjusted alpha of 0.05)).  Table 7 shows the resulting 
power calculations for 150 and 100 participants per study arm under these options.

 Thus for the primary outcomes, the sample sizes of 150and 100 (with 30% potential loss -to-
follow up), under consideration provide adequate power for medium effect sizes regardless of 
the assumed within -person correlation between measurements. For these out comes we assume

Version 3 Dated:   06/[ADDRESS_1258935] one STI biomarker 
versus none (estimated at 19.2% for the usual care group at baseline), the power for 150, at sample 
sizes under consideration, is reasonable (close to 80%)  for a 50% decrease in the proportion, that 
is, about 9%.  
 
 Statistical Analysis . The principal statistical a nalyses for the three primary outcomes will proceed 
in two phases for each outcome separately: a cross -sectional evaluation of the study arms at ba seline 
and full longitudinal evaluations of study effectiveness.  The baseline comparisons of the 
participants in the study arms will be performed on demographic characteristics and outcome 
measurements. The analyses will include chi -square tests, and para metric and non -parametric 
analysis of variance appropriate to the characteristic or outcome being compared, and will evaluate 
the baseline comparability of the participants in the study arms.  Study effectiveness will be 
evaluated through longitudinal anal yses of marginal treatment differences performed with general 
linear model formulations using the generalized estimating equations technique135 and parameters 
based on the underlying distribution of the outcome (e.g., Normal or Poisson or negative binomial).  
All dependent variables (number of binge drinking epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841], number of drinks per week, number of 
drinking days per week, number of sexual p artners, number of epi[INVESTIGATOR_898120], epi[INVESTIGATOR_898147]) will be analyzed as individual models with treatment group as the primary 
independent variable. All models will include baseline illicit drug use, age, HIV status, and 
psychiatric symptoms to adjust for potential imbalances in strata co -factors. Interaction terms will 
be created (including, but not limited to, prior STI, psychiatric symptoms, time) to test if specific 
covariates modify intervention effects and any interaction at a s ignificance of p ≤ 0.1 will be further 
tested.  
 
All available information from participants will be included in the analyses regardless of 
participation level.  Diagnostics will be employed to evaluate the appropriateness of model 
assumptions and covarianc e structure, with alternate strategies (e.g., transformations, non -linear 
models, non -parametric methods, alternate covariance structure) used if necessary. Individual 
contrasts will be employed to examine pair -wise differences between groups and between t he 
baseline and follow -up measurement periods. Tests will be conducted at a two -sided alpha = 0.05 
level of significance, pair -wise comparisons between the study groups will be conducted with an 
experiment -wise alpha = 0.05, and estimates will be provided with 95% confidence intervals. All 
efficacy outcome measures will be analyzed under the intent -to-treat principle, and the sample 
analyzed will include all subjects who are randomized regardless of whether they actually received 
the study treatment to whic h they were assigned or completed the study . Non -compliance will not 
be a large factor as the intervention is given at a short period of time (a single time point for the 
brief intervention and over 6 weeks for those with the IVR). However, it is probable that some 
individuals will drop out of the trial. In this case it is possible that there could be a selection bias. 136 
To address this potential bias, we will use inverse probability of dropout weights (this is analogous 
to the inverse probability of cens oring weights that have been used in observational studies. 136-[ADDRESS_1258936] specific weight that corresponds to the inverse probability that the individual 
remains in the trial up to time t (the scheduled visits at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months). These  weights are 
then applied to the generalized linear model with GEE that was previously used for the intent -to-
treat analysis.136, [ADDRESS_1258937] a higher tendency to withdraw from the study are up -weighted.

selection bias is removed.[ADDRESS_1258938] 
the model.137, 138   An important assumption (not unique to these methods) is that there are no 
unmeasured confounders that are missing from these models. To assess the impact of possible 
unmeasured confounders, sensitiv ity analyses for marginal structural models will be applied. 144, 145. 
Analyses will be performed primarily using SAS v9.1 (SAS Institute, Inc. Cary NC).  
 
 
d. Early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004].  
We do not plan to conduct interim analyses of the dependent measures.   
6. Risks  
 There are two primary risks to this study: breach of confidentiality and psychological distress. 
Participants will be asked to provide sensitive information related to alcohol and drug use, and high 
risk sexual behaviors. Every effort will be made to ens ure confidentiality, including the use of 
ACASI, and a federal certificate of confidentiality. Psychological/emotional distress may occur 
during assessment interviews or during the brief intervention as issues related to drugs, alcohol, 
and sexual risk beh aviors may be emotionally difficult.  
 
a. Medical risks, listing all procedures, their major and minor risks and expected frequency.  
1) Confidentiality: Participants will be asked to provide sensitive information related to alcohol 
and drug use, and high risk sexual behaviors. We will obtain a federal Certificate of 
Confidentiality to protect the participant against the release of private/ sensitive information.  In 
addition, all participants will be assigned unique study identification numbers. A master file 
linking study identification numbers to participant names/contact [CONTACT_136258] a 
password protected file that only the investigators and project manager will have access to. In 
addition, all paper files and data will be kept in a locked filing cabinet.  
Confidentiality of Cell Phone Counseling and Text Messaging: Individuals will be coun seled 
via their cell phone using IVR  technology and text messages. In the event that a cell phone is 
misplaced or borrowed by [CONTACT_898178]. To 
avoid this, prior to the delivery of cell phone counseling, women will be required to enter the 
last [ADDRESS_1258939]. Finkelstein’s research group. Thus no calls will 
be linked to the STD clinic. Similarly, for text messaging, no  personal identifiers will be linked 
to text messages. Because text messages originate from a secure Johns Hopkins server, text 
messages will not be linked to the STD clinic.  
 
 All study outcomes will be reported as aggregate data.  In addition, all invest igators and members 
of the research team will have completed Johns Hopkins University on -line modules on Human 
Subjects Research and HIPAA. HIV testing and counseling are performed routinely within the 
BCHD STI Clinic. All women who undergo HIV testing and  counseling will be informed that the 
result of their test is confidential but that there will be mandatory reporting of new cases to the State 
of MD. We expect breach of confidentiality to be a rare or infrequent event.  
2) A second risk to this study is p sychological distress. A participant may become uncomfortable while 
answering sensitive questions related to drug and alcohol use, sexual risk behaviors, mood, anxiety 
or during the brief intervention.  If a woman experiences significant distress during th e interview, 
the research assessment will be stopped, and [CONTACT_898181], a PhD in Clinical Psychology, or 
[CONTACT_898182] a general internist, will evaluate the participant, and assess if she is at risk 
for harming herself or others.  If necessar y, they will either personally escort her or if need be

b. Steps taken to mini mize the risks.  
To minimize risks associated with breach of confidentiality, each participant will be assigned a 
unique study ID. A master file linking study identification numbers to participant names/contact 
[CONTACT_136258] a password protect ed file that only the investigators and project manager 
will have access to. In addition, all paper files and data will be kept in a locked filing cabinet. All 
study outcomes will be reported as aggregate data.  All IVR and text message counseling will 
originate from a secure Johns Hopkins Server, and thus will not be linked to the STD clinic. In 
addition, all investigators and members of the research team will have completed Johns Hopkins 
University on -line modules on Human Subjects Research and HIPAA. HIV testing and counseling 
are performed routinely within the BCHD STI Clinic.  
 
c. Plan for reporting unanticipated problems or study deviations.  
Study devia tions and unanticipated problems will be reported to the Johns Hopkins IRB by [CONTACT_898179].  
 
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject, not necessarily having a 
causal relationship with the study. A serious adverse event (SAE) is any untoward medical 
occurrence that a) results in death, b) is life -threatenin g, c) requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8448], d) results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, 
or e) is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
AE's may be graded as: Mild (no limitation of usual activities) , Moderate (some limitation) or 
Severe (inability to carry out usual activities). The relationship of the AE to the study procedures is 
classified as: Not related, Unlikely, Possible, Probable, or Definite. The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_898148] r distinguishing between an AE and SAE. SAE will be reported by [CONTACT_898180] (JHMI) IRB, NIAAA project officers, and the Baltimore City 
Health Department (BCHD) within [ADDRESS_1258941] the opportunity to receive counseling for hazardous alcohol use. 
Both the assessments and the interventions will result in an increased awareness of health behaviors.  
Benefits to others include increased knowledge of the effectiveness of brief alcohol intervention 
among high -risk women. In addition, if effective, computer -directed brief intervention may be 
adopted for more widespread use in STI clinics.

 Ultimately if computer -directed brief alcohol/sexual risk reduction intervention or telephone 
counseling via IVR is found to be effective in reducing hazardous alcohol use and/or risky 
behaviors and improving health outcomes, this technology can be transfe rred to STI clinic settings 
for widespread implementation.  Furthermore, if the intervention(s) prove to be effective study 
findings will offer “real life” specialty care clinics a screening and intervention package that is 
practical and would require no ad ditional staff time and resources for implementation  
 
 
 
8. Payment and Remuneration  
Randomized participants will receive $ 30 for participation in the baseline assessment In addition, 
all participants, regardless of group assignment, will be paid for follow -up assessments at 3 -mos 
($35); 6-mos ($40) and 12 -mos ($50) with a $ [ADDRESS_1258942] yielded high rates of participation in other RCTs with substance abusing 
populations.  Also, subjects will rece ive bus tokens to facilitate their transportation to and from the 
interviews. Individuals who complete the 1 5 minute screening but do not qualify for the 
intervention will receive $ 5 for their time. Individuals who receive and respond to booster calls 
will be reimbursed for their cell phone minutes at $5 per call.  They will also receive an additional

comparison to existing products .  
CooperVision is interested to better understand the performance of  their own frequent 
replacement lens Biofinity Multifocal ( CONTROL ) in comparison to the competitor product 
TOTAL30 multifocal  (TEST ), which has recently been launched by [CONTACT_911316].  
[ADDRESS_1280092]. 
The prim ary outcome variable for this study is: 
•  ‘Lens handling for insertion’ , using a 0- [ADDRESS_1280093] are subjective feedback on comfort, vision and overall performance using 
ratings, agreement questions and preferences .

5 MATERIALS AND METHODS  
5.1 STUDY DESIGN  
5.1.1 OVERALL DESIGN 
This is a prospective, randomized, participant -masked , crossover, bilateral dispensing study  
conducted at approximately 5 clinical practice sites  in the [LOCATION_002]  and Canada. Each lens 
type will be worn for approximately  4-6 weeks : the lens prescription of each lens type will be 
EX-MKTG -153 Protocol v1. 1 12Dec 2023   10 optimized after 3 -10 days wearing experience, prior to starting a 1- month  (28-32 days)  wear 
period.  
5.1.[ADDRESS_1280094] lenses  in a randomized order.  
A randomization schedule will be generated for each site using a web- based program  (for 
example, www.randomization.com  or similar ). to  determine the order CONTROL and TEST  lens 
wear . The final study randomization schedule will be generated by [CONTACT_94648]’s  Database 
Administrator  and provided to each site.  
5.1.3 MASKING  
Lens packages/f oils will be over -labeled with strongly adhesive stickers to mask the participant 
to the lens brand . 
It is not possible for the study investigators to be masked because of the need to follow the 
specific lens fitting guide during the lens prescript ion optimization visit (Visits 0, 1- 1, 2-1).  
5.2 INVESTIGATIONAL  SITES  
5.2.1 NUMBER OF SITES  
This study will be conducted at approximately 5 optometry practice sites in the US and Canada .   
 
5.2.2 INVESTIGATOR RECRUITMENT  
The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_94620]:  
• Is a l icensed Optometrist with at least two years of contact [CONTACT_305760]. 
• Can demonstrate training in Good Clinical Practice (GCP) by [CONTACT_94632].  
• Accepts responsibility for the conduct of the study at their site. 
• Has in- office email and either document scanning capabilities or fax. 
• Will scan and send all study visit documents to CORE, ideally the same day* as the 
visit or at most within 2 days of the study visit.  
• Is willing  to follow the study protocol and to co- operate with the study monitors  at 
CORE . 
* Study documents are required as soon as possible because this allows for a timely data 
review, query and entry.  
EX-MKTG -[ADDRESS_1280095] lens B (CooperVision, data on file). In that study a 0- 100 scale was also used and a 
target difference of 5 units on the 0- 100 scale was chosen as a meaningful clinical difference in 0 -
100 subjective responses.  
Using the 0- 100 scale data described above for ‘lens handling for insertion’, where the data 
showed a standard deviation of 12 .7 and when applying requirements of 80% power and alpha 
0.[ADDRESS_1280096] 53 completing the study.

5.3.2 NUMBER O F  PARTICIPANTS  
Participants will be recruited using site records, databases and advertising materials ( e.g., 
posters, email scripts) approved by [CONTACT_94633]. All initial individual -targeted 
recruitment activities, such as any direct mailing of recruitment scripts, will be conducted by 
[CONTACT_234988]. This separation will reduce any undue influence of the optometrist -patient relationship. This process will also 
eliminate opportunity for the investigator to access personal health information before any consent for disclosure is provided by [CONTACT_52764].  

EX-MKTG -153 Protocol v1. 1 12Dec 2023   12 It is anticipated that up to 80 potential participants may attend a Screening visit and 
approximately 60 participants may be randomized and dispensed with study products, with a 
target of 53 completing the study.   
 
5.3.3 INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA  
A person is eligible for inclusion in the study if he/she:  
1. Is at least 42  years of age and has full legal capacity to volunteer ; 
2. Has read and signed an information consent letter; 
3. Self reports having a full eye examination in the previous two years; 
4. Anticipates being able to wear the study lenses for at least 8 hours a day, 5 days a week;  
5. Is willing and able to follow instructions and maintain the appointment schedule; 
6. Habitual ly wears  spherical  multifocal soft contact [CONTACT_94636], for the past 3 months 
minimum ^;  
- Maximum of  4 participants (out of 12 ) per site may  be habitual wearers of daily 
disposable lenses ,  
- Maximum  of 4 participants (out of 12 ) per site may be habitual wearers of Biofinity  
Multifocal , 
- Maximum of 4 participants (out of 12 ) per site may be habitual wearers of either 
TOTAL30 Multifocal  or AirOptix plus Hydra Glyde Multifocal  
7. Has refractive astigmatism no higher than -0.75D C; 
8. Is presby[CONTACT_94637] a reading addition of at least +0.75D  and no more than 
+2.50D; 
9. Can be fit and achieve binocular distance vision  of at least 20/30 Snellen which 
participants also deem to be ‘acceptable’, with the available study lens parameters  
(Distance sphere + 4 to -6; near addition as per study design). 
 
^Exceptions may be permitted after discussion with the study monitor or sponsor  to target the anticipated 
habitual lens distribution across all sites . If necessary, additional exceptions may be permitted after 
discussion with the study monitor or sponsor . 
 
A person will be excluded from the study if he/she:  
1. Is participating in any concurrent clinical or research trial; 
EX-MKTG -153 Protocol v1. 1 12Dec 2023   13 2. Has any known active * ocular disease and/or infection that contraindicates contact [CONTACT_94638] ; 
3. Has a  systemic condition  that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_94621]  a study 
outcome variable;  
4. Is using any systemic or topi[INVESTIGATOR_94622] a study outcome variable; 
5. Has known sensitivity to the diagnostic sodium fluorescein used in the study;  
6. Self-reports  as pregnant, lactating or planning a pregnancy at the time of enrolment;  
7. Has undergone refractive error surgery  or intraocular surgery . 
* For the purposes of this study, active ocular disease is defined as infection  or inflammation which 
requires therapeutic treatment. Mild (i.e. not considered clinically relevant) lid abnormalities  (blepharit is, 
meibomian gland dysfunction, papi[INVESTIGATOR_1257]), corneal and conjunctival staining and dry eye are not considered 
active ocular disease.  Neovascularization and corneal scars  are the result of previous hypoxia, infection or 
inflammation and are therefore not active.  
 
Age ≥42 years is an inclusion criterion  because presby[CONTACT_94639] < 42 
years and, if present, may not be due solely to presby[CONTACT_769893].   
Pregnant and lactating women are not being excluded from the study due to safety  concerns but 
due to fl uctuations in refractive error, accommodation and/ or visual acuity that  occur secondary 
to systemic hormonal changes. It has further been shown that pregnancy could impact tear 
production, which could impact dry eye  symptoms. Such fl uctuations could affect data, thereby

5.[ADDRESS_1280097] lens, trial lenses for the fitting can either  be ordered based on the participant’s 
refraction and/or latest contact [CONTACT_911317] a fitting set of the test lens may be used if 
available. Following a successful lens fit commercial TEST lenses will be ordered.   
Reimbursement to practice sites for study product expenses will be provided by [CONTACT_911318], after CORE has reconciled the invoices and the product accountability and dispensing logs. 
EX-MKTG -153 Protocol v1. 1 12Dec 2023   15 5.4.3 OTHER PRODUCTS  
Sodium fluorescein will be used to assess corneal and conjunctival staining.   
5.4.4 REWETTING DROPS  
Participants will not be encouraged to use rewetting drops; however, those who habitually used 
rewetting drops will be allowed to continue using their normal drops.  
5.4.[ADDRESS_1280098] two hours. If  this is not the case and the participant  is not experiencing 
any problems  with the lenses, the appointment will be rescheduled, ideally within the visit window.   
Visits that fall outside of the specified visit windows will be designated as protocol deviations and 
at the end of the study, the data collected during protocol deviations will be assessed for their suitability to be included in the analysis population. 
Table 3 summarizes the scheduled study visits and study codes. 
EX-MKTG -153 Protocol v1. 1 12Dec 2023   17 Participants will be assigned a unique alpha -numeric study ID after they sign the consent 
documentation i.e., before their eligibility for the study has been confirmed. Each site will use a 
different letter preceding the participant ID  number.  For example, participant 01 at  site W will be 
W01, and participant 01 at site Z will be Z 01. Ineligible participants will be discontinued from the 
study.  
The investigator will determine participant eligibility using the inclusion and exclusion criteria. 
The study procedures are outlined below: 
1. The participant is expected to insert their habitual multifocal contact [CONTACT_94644] 2 
hours before attending the visit   
2. The participant will be required to read and sign an Informed Consent Form  prior to 
enrollment. When the participant has signed the consent form, the participant will be 
considered enrolled in the study and will  be assigned a study ID . 
3. Participant demographics and medical history (age, sex, medical conditions, 
medications, allergies).  
4. Contact [CONTACT_94645] (habitual lens information and wearing habits).

6 MONITORING PROTOCOL ADHERENCE  
Adherence to study visit windows, lens wearing schedule, and time windows around other data 
collection points (i.e. subjective ratings) will be monitored by [CONTACT_94648]. Deviations from the study 
plan as  described in the protocol will be reported in the study report. As described in Section 13.4, 
major protocol deviations will be reported to the Sponsor and Sterling Institutional Review Board  
within 10 days of becoming aware of them (as per Sterling Institutional Review Board  guidelines) .  
[ADDRESS_1280107] lenses and/or different lens care products at no cost to them. The contact [CONTACT_516160]. This study will investigate participants’ wearing schedule intended for daily wear (NOT extended wear) , similar to the average wearing time of 10 -16 hours for daily wear lenses.  

EX-MKTG -153 Protocol v1. 1 12Dec 2023   26 All lenses used in this study are IDE exempt under 21 CFR 812.2(c)2.  
The habitual lens and the two study contact [CONTACT_512388]; 
on a daily wear , monthly -replacement  basis. When contact [CONTACT_512389] a daily wear 
basis there is a small risk of an adverse event compared to not wearing contact [CONTACT_13276]. When 
contact [CONTACT_512390], there is a significantly increased risk of an adverse reaction compared with wearing contact [CONTACT_35491] a daily wear basis.  
Adverse events and/ or complications in daily wear of  soft contact [CONTACT_94652]  (e.g.: 
inflammation and infection).  Complications that may occur during the wearing of contact [CONTACT_94653], dryness, aching or itching eyes, excessive tearing, discharge, hyperemia and variable or blurred vision.  More serious risks may include pain, photophobia, iritis, corneal edema or eye infection. Although contact [CONTACT_13293] -related infections are very infrequent, the 
possibility does exist.  The incidence of infection due to day -wear soft lenses is 0.035%. Almost 
always an infection will occur only in one eye.  This risk is assumed by [ADDRESS_1280108] lenses and only current soft lens wearers will be recruited for this study.  
A dye (fluorescein) normally used for eye examinations is being used in this study. Although 
rare, it is possible to have an allergic reaction to the dye. Participants will be asked if they  have  a 
known allergy or sensitivity to fluorescein. 
The assessments conducted in this study are r outine clinical procedures  and they includ e auto-
refraction, auto- keratometry, visual acuity, anterior ocular health assessment, and contact [CONTACT_94654]. In addition, high magnification imaging of the lens fit may be made using 35 
mm or digital cameras . Patients will be monitored frequently  until the end of the study to reduce 
the occurrence of adverse or potential adverse events. Patients will be given instructions from 
their investigator regarding early symptoms and signs of adverse events.  
8 ADVERSE EVENTS  
See CORE SOP012 for a description of all adverse events, including management and reporting.  
An ‘adverse event’ refers to any undesirable clinical occurrence in a participant, whether it is considered to be device -related or not. Adverse events (AE) may be classified as ‘unanticipated 
adverse device effects,’ ‘serious adverse events,’ ‘significant  adverse events,’ or ‘non- significant 
adverse events,’ as defined below , Table 5.  
A number of conditions may result in temporary suspension until resolution. These include corneal infiltrates, corneal staining, limbal injection, bulbar injection or tarsal conjunctival abnormalities.  
EX-MKTG -153 Protocol v1. 1 12Dec 2023   29 for each adverse event. If both eyes are involved, a separate adverse event form will be completed 
for each eye . Whenever possible, the adverse event will be photo -documented.  
Expenses incurred for medical treatment as part of study participation will be paid by [CONTACT_456] (bills and prescription receipts kept). The participant must be followed until resolution or no further change is anticipated and/or referred for further care with the appropriate health care professional and/or recorded as being under appropriate health care as per investigator’s discretion. A written 
report will be completed indicating the subsequent treatment and resolution of the condition.  
8.3 REPORTING ADVERSE EVENTS  
All potential Serious Adverse Events and Unanticipated Adverse Device Effects that are related 
or possibly related to participant’s participation will be reported to CORE’s lead study coordinator  
(details below) and also to the sponsor (details below) within 24 hours of the investigator becoming 
aware of the event. The  site’s Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_94623] 
10 days of becoming aware of the Serious or Unanticipated event, using the Reportable Events Form. All fatal or life -threatening events will be reported immediately to the IRB.  
Significant and Non- Significant Adverse Events will be reported to CORE’s lead study coordinator  
and the sponsor as soon as possible, but no later than 5 working days after the occurrence.  Each

9 DISCONTINUATION FROM THE STUDY  
Participants may be discontinued at the discretion of the investigator or sponsor in consideration 
of participant safety or protocol compliance, or at discretion of the participant.  Participants discontinued from a study will be reimbursed for their active involvement in the study (including the initial screening visit  and all lens fitting visits ).  Upon discontinuing, a participant will be 
offered the option of their data being withdrawn from future statistical analysis. The following is a list of possible reasons for discontinuation from the study: 
• Screening failure: Part icipants will be discontinued if  they do not meet the inclusion and 
exclusion criteria outlined in section 5.2.3. 
• Unacceptable performance with products to be used in study: Participants may be discontinued if they are unable to achieve acceptable comfort and /or vision with the 
study products.  
• Positive slit lamp finding:  Participants may be permanently discontinued from the study 
depending on the severity of the condition and on the judgement of the investigator.   
• Adverse event: If a participant experiences an adverse event during the study they may 
be discontinued based on the clinical judgement of the investigator.  
• Symptoms : If the participant has persistent symptoms they may be discontinued based 
on the clinical judgement of the investigator.  
• Disinterest, relocation or illness: The participant may choose to discontinue due to reasons within or beyond their control.  
• Violation of protocol or non- compliance:  The participant will be discontinued if they are 
unable or unwilling to follow the protocol specified visit schedules  and/or study 
procedures . 
• Instillation of topi[INVESTIGATOR_94625]:  The participant will be discontinued if they elect to use a topi[INVESTIGATOR_234982] a limited duration (less than two weeks)  to treat a transient condition; in 
this case  the participant may remain an active participant (at the discretion of the 
investigator) after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_234983]).  
EX-MKTG -153 Protocol v1. 1 12Dec 2023   31 • Lost to follow -up:  The participant will be discontinued if they cannot be contact[CONTACT_94655] a final exit visit, and if the investigator has made a reasonable effort to 
contact [CONTACT_94656] a final study visit.  
• Premature termination of the study by [CONTACT_456], CORE  or Sterling IRB . 
A discontinuation form , stating the reason for discontinuation will be completed, which requires 
the signatures of both the participant and the investigator except where the participant is lost to 
follow- up in which case only the signature [CONTACT_94669] .   
When a participant choses  to discontinue from the study they will be given the opportunity to 
withdraw their data from the statistical analysis. This choice will be captured on the discontinuation form.  
All discontinuations including their reasons will be included in the final report.  
[ADDRESS_1280109] would also be notified within 24 hours of 
any device malfunction that may contribute to a  Serious Adverse Event . 
Other defective lenses should be reported to CORE as soon as possible (usually in weekly study 
updates).  
This clinical study will also ascertain satisfaction or preference with subjective attributes such as comfort, vision, or lens handling. Responses to these subjective questionnaires will not be 
considered as complaints or device malfunctions.

EX-MKTG -153 Protocol v1. 1 12Dec 2023   32 12 S TATISTICAL ANALYSIS AND DATA MANAGEMENT  
12.1 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
All data will be analyzed by [CONTACT_94657].  D escriptive statistics will be  
provided on information regarding demographics (e.g. age, sex).  
Differences between lenses and differences over time will be  compared using either Paired t -
tests or Wilcoxon matched pairs. Analysis will be  conducted using Statistica [ADDRESS_1280111] deviations will be  provided 
for each variable. Medians will be  provided for those variables analyzed with non- parametric 
tests. For all tests, values of p<0.05 will be  considered significant.  
For assessments conducted for each eye separately, the right eye will be  used for analysis. If a 
general difference is  found (paired t -test / Wilcoxon matched pairs) between OD and OS, a 
comment will be  provided. Visual acuity data will be analyzed using OU.  
For the agreement and preference data, binomial testing will be  used to analyze the count data 
of subjective answers: For agreement analysis, “strongly agree” and “agree” will be  combined 
into a single “agreement” category; similarly, “strongly disagree” and “disagree” will be  combined 
into a single “disagreement” category. The number of “neither agree/disagree” ratings will be  
evenly distributed to these two categories on the basis they would be equally likely to choose 
either.  Comments regarding the clinical relevance of differences in subjective ratings will be  
based on the conclusion by [CONTACT_911319] -Cornago et al.[ADDRESS_1280112] been recorded in the source documents. Only relevant and applicable comments will be included in the final report as deemed necessary by [CONTACT_94648]’s L ead Co-ordinator .  
13 PROTOCOL & OTHER TRAINING  
All study personnel will be required to complete training prior to their involvement in the study. Records of training will be kept at CORE . This will include training by [CONTACT_94660] , study procedures, informed consent procedures, and on the randomization and 
participant masking procedures .  
Prior to starting the study, all site Principal Investigators and co-investigators will provide 
CooperVision with a scan of their curriculum vitae, license to practice optometry , GCP training  
and evidence of professional indemnity insurance.  
14 STUDY MONITORING  
Each site will provide regular status reports to CORE. Status reports will include:  
• The number of participants screened, enrolled, and randomized (i.e. assigned a study ID number), discontinued and completed.  
• Details of all protocol deviations, adverse events, device malfunctions . 
• Reports of unintended events.  
CORE will collate the site updates and provide frequent  status reports to the study sponsor.  
Study monitoring visits to the sites may be conducted by [CONTACT_94648], the sponsor, or sponsor’s designate, throughout the study and will be scheduled in conjunction with the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_12758]. In addition, study records may be inspected by [CONTACT_456], the 
sponsor's designate, Sterling Institutional Review Board, and by [CONTACT_234993], namely Health Canada and the [LOCATION_002] Food and Drug Administration (FDA); however, they will not be permitted to take away any records containing identifiable personal information.  
Study data review and data monitoring will be conducted by [CONTACT_94662]. To improve data 
integrity, data entry will be conducted by [CONTACT_94663] a second person will visually compare 
EX-MKTG -153 Protocol v1. 1 12Dec 2023   35 the data entry to the source documents.  Data queries will be reported to the site within 5 working 
days of receipt of initial data. A response resolving the query will be expected from the site within 
5 working days of receipt of the query.  
All adverse events and protocol deviations will be reviewed by [CONTACT_1377] [INVESTIGATOR_234984]’s Lead Coordinator. All serious adverse events and major protocol deviations will be reviewed by [CONTACT_1377] [INVESTIGATOR_234984]’s Director and/or Head of Clinical 
Research.

 SYNOPSIS  
Protocol Number PAT -CR-302 
Title:  A Multicenter, Double -blind, Placebo -controlled, Randomized Withdrawal, Parallel 
Group Study of Patiromer for the Management of Hyperkalemia in Subjects 
Receiving Renin -Angiotensin -Aldosterone System Inhibitor (RAASi) Medications 
for the Treatment of Heart F ailure  
Short Title:  DIAMOND  
Study  Product(s):  Patiromer (RLY5016) and placebo  
Study Population:  Subjects with HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) who are hyperkalemic 
(serum K+ >5.0 mEq/L) while receiving treatment with RAASi medications or who 
are normokalemic (serum K+ ≥4.0–≤5.0 mEq/L) but have a history of hyperkalemia 
prior to Screening with subsequent reduction or discontinuation of a RAASi 
medication . 
Phase:  Phase 3b  
Sponsor:  Vifor Pharma , Inc. 
Protocol Number:  PAT -CR-302 
Objectives:  Primary Objective : 
To assess the effects of patiromer compared with placebo on serum K+ in HF patients . 
Design:  Prospective Phase 3b multinational, multicenter , double -blind, placebo -controlled, 
randomized withdrawal, parallel group study that includes Screening , an up to  12 
week s Run-in Phase (all subjects will have patiromer initiated and RAASi 
medications, including MRA , optimized) and a randomized withdrawal Blinded 
Treatment Phase.  
Duration:  Each subject’s participation includes a Run -in Phase ( single -blind ed, up to 12 weeks)  
followed by [CONTACT_571599] ( double -blind ed, variable per subject).  Study 
duration for individual subjects will vary, depending on the ir individual  enrollment  
date. Subjects  who prematurely discontinue patiromer/placebo will remain in the 
study for the collection of clinical event s data, up to and including the common EoS , 
and will receive usual care  during the study phase . 
Study Treatments:  Patiromer or Placebo:  
During the Run -in Phase, subjects who meet all eligibility criteria will initiate 
patiromer , single -blind ed, at an oral dose of 1  packet/day (8.4  g/day). The dose will 
be adjusted based on local  serum K+ levels in accordance with the patiromer treatment 
algorithm (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] ). 
During the Treatment Phase  (double -blind ed), subjects will be randomized to receive 
patiromer or placebo and will initially continue on the same number of packets as 
established for patirom er during the Run -in Phase but may be up - or down -titrated 
depending on local serum K+ levels (see Treatment Phase and Section [IP_ADDRESS] ). 

 
 
PAT -CR-302  
Protocol Version 4.0, 23 June 2021  Page 8 of 139 
 HF Treatments:  RAAS  Inhibitors:  
Since subjects who enter this study will either have hyperkalemia or a previous 
history of hyperkalemia due to  the use of RAASi medications, the Run -in Phase is 
intended for the management of serum K+ with patiromer to allow optimization of 
RAASi HF treatm ents ( i.e., ACEi/ARB or ARNi and MRA  (spi[INVESTIGATOR_571545] )). The Investigator  should evaluate the RAASi treatment(s) that subjects 
are receiving for HF against recommendations from professional society HF 
guidelines and make adjustments in accorda nce with guideline recommendations ; see 
Study Manual for additional details  on guideline recommendations  and the 
study -specific target doses [1]. For a subject to be eligible for randomization into the 
Treatment Phase, the subject must be on  ≥50% of the target dose of an 
ACEi/ARB/ARNi , and ≥50% of the target  dose of MRA (spi[INVESTIGATOR_571546], see Study Manual  [1] for information on the study -specific target 
dose of individual RAASi medications and Section  6.7.2 ). 
During the  Treatment Phase, subjects randomized to either patiromer or placebo will 
initially continue on the doses of RAASi medications (ACEi/ARB/ARNi  and/or 
MRA)  optimized during the Run -in Phase (s ee the Procedures section below and 
Section  [IP_ADDRESS]  in the protocol for details on the management of hyperkalemia during 
this period ). 
Usual Care:  
Whether subjects are treated with patiromer or placebo during the Blinded Treatment 
Phase, usual care in accordance with guideline recommendations will be provided for 
all subjects . Usual care includes recommendations for all aspects of care for HFrEF 
patients (i.e., dietary and exercise recommendations, implantable devices, and 
procedures  and medications  for the management of HF ). Usual care may also include 
patient education. See Section  6.8.4  for additional details regarding concomitant 
medication use.  
Management of K+: 
Serum  K+ levels will be monitored and managed throughout the study. The 
management of K+ is different during the Run -in Phase from the Treatment Phase. 
Urgent treatment of hyperkalemia  is in accordance with usual care and the 
Investigator’s judgment. See Procedures section of the synopsis for further details.  
Inclusion Criteria:  The following criteria must be met for each subject  prior to entry into the Run -in 
Phase :

 Screening Phase and Run-in Phase  (Single -Blinded , Up to 12 Weeks ): 
At the end of the Screening Phase , subjects who satisfy the eligibility criteria will be 
enrolled into the Run -in Phase. The purpose of the Run -in Phase is to select subjects 
who will potentially benefit from treatment and not unnecessarily expose those wh o 
will not. In addition, the Run -in Phase is for management of serum K+ with patiromer 
to allow optimization of RAASi medications and their dosage  (including initiation of 
MRA if not already receiving an MRA) . 
All subjects who meet the eligibility criteria for the Run -in Phase (single -blinded) 
will initiate patiromer (1  packet/day).  
Subjects with 2 screening K+ values >5.0  mEq/L are considered hyper kalemic ; these 
subject s begin patiromer when they qualify for the Run -in Phase , i.e., on the same 
day Run-in qualification is met or the next day.  
Note: If one screening K+ value is >5.0  mEq/L and one value is ≤5.0 mEq/L, then a 
third peripheral venipuncture is performed within [ADDRESS_750464] is hyperkalemic or normokalemic  (local serum K+ ≥4.0-≤5.0 mEq/ L). 
All other subjects are considered normokalemic  and serum K+ will be measured again 
latest after the first week during the Run-in Phase . Patiromer will be started at this 
first Run-in Visit only if subjects  are still normokalemic or have progressed to 
hyperkalemia; in case of newly observed hypokalemia  (local serum K+ <4.0 mEq/ L) 
during the first Run-in Week, patiromer must not be given . In subjects with 
hypokalemia serum K+ must be controlled after [ADDRESS_750465]  week of  the Run-in Phase , ACEi/ARB/ARNi and/or MRA  doses 
ideally remain unchanged, if clinically indicated. On or a fter the Run-in Week  1 Visit, 
up-titration of ACEi/ARB/ARNi and/or MRA  may be initiated . 
Patiromer is titrated during the Run-in Phase  to achieve target local serum K+ level 
of ≥4.0–≤5.0 mEq/L (see below).  
Note: Depending on the actual local serum K+ value this could include patiromer 
0 g/day (i.e., 0  packet s/day) during the Run-in Phase.  
• If local serum K+ is >5.0  mEq/L, up -titrate patiromer in at least (≥) 1-week 
intervals by 1  packet/day (maximum dose is 3 packets/day)  
− If subject is taking maximum dose patiromer (3 packets/day) and local 
serum K+ remains >5. 0 mEq/L during the Run -in Phase, then subject is 
Run-in failed  
• If local serum K+ is >5.0 –≤5.5 mEq/L and the reduction in serum K+ from the 
previous visit was ≥0.4 mEq/L, at the Investigator’s discretion, a do se increase 
of patiromer may not be required  
• If local serum K+ is ≥4.3–≤5.0 mEq/L at the first week during the Run -in Phase, 
patiromer must be started at  1 packet/day  
• If local serum K+ is ≥4.0–<4.3 mEq/L at the first week during the Run-in Phase, 
patiromer may be started at  1 packet/day ; initiation or increase of patiromer dose 
should be made with caution when local serum K+ is ≥4.0–<4.3 mEq/L to avoid 
inducing hypokalemia  
• If local serum K+ decreases from >4.3  mEq/L  to values <4.3 mEq/L , remaining 
≥4.0 mEq/L, patiromer may be down -titrated by 1 packet/day (minimum dose is 
0 packets/day) ; in case of a reversal of this  decrease from <4.3 mEq/L  but

 remaining ≥4.0 mEq/L  to values ≥4.3 mEq/L at following visits , patiromer may 
be up -titrated by 1  packet/day ; subject s must receive at least 1  packet/day at 
serum K+ ≥4.3–≤5.0 mEq/L  
− If 1 week after reducing patiromer to 0  packet s/day local serum K+ remains 
stable ≥4.0–≤4.3 mEq/L, optimize RAASi dose and resume patiromer at  1 
packet/day before considering these subjects as Run -in failed ; initiation or 
increase of patiromer dose should be made with caution when local serum 
K+ is ≥4.0–≤4.3 mEq/L to avoid inducing hypokalemia  
• If local serum K+ is <4.0 mEq/L, patiromer  must be down -titrated  to 0 g/day (i.e., 
0 packets/day), with confirmation of hypokalemia within [ADDRESS_750466] 1-week intervals until serum K+ is ≥4.0 mEq/L. Resume patiromer 
only when local serum K+ rises to >5.0  mEq/L  
− If 2 weeks after taking the minimum 0  packet s/day, local serum K+ remains  
<4.0 mEq/L during the Run -in Phase, then subject is Run-in failed  
Optimization of ACE i/ARB /ARNi or MRA  During Run -in Phase : 
The Investigator should manage ACEi/ARB/ARNi or MRA  dose initiation , 
escalation  and maintenance  with the aim to achieve 100% of target doses as per the 
Study Manual, using clinical judgment to customize ACEi/ARB/ARNi or MRA  
addition or dose escalation based on subject response ; see Section  6.7.2 , 
Section  6.8.2 , and Study Manual  [1] for a summary of practice guideline 
recommendations .  
Initiation or escalation of ACEi/ARB/ARNi or MRA dose should be made with 
caution when local serum K+ is >5.0 mEq/L. Assessment of serum K+ will occur at 
each visit. The patiromer dose  is titrated based on th e subject’s K+ level as presented 
above.  
Subjects  may be randomized anytime (but no later than 12  weeks) during the Run -in 
Phase when they  meet all of the following randomization criteria : 
• Current MRA dose is at  least the target  dose* (e.g., spi[INVESTIGATOR_8407] 50 mg/day, 
eplerenone 50 mg/day) and has been stable for at least 1 week  
• Current ACEi/ARB/ARNi is  ≥50% of the target dose* and has been stable for at 
least 1  week  
• Current patiromer dose is at least 1  packet daily  
Current  local  serum K+ level is ≥4.0–≤5.0 mEq/L  
* Study -specific target doses as per Table 4 in the S tudy Manual.  
Subjects are Run-in failed  from the study if:  
• After completing 12 weeks of Run -in do not meet the randomization criteria  
• 1 week after taking the maximum 3  packets/day dose of patiromer, local serum 
K+ remains  >5.0 mEq/L  
• 2 weeks after taking the minimum 0  packet s/day, local serum  K+ remains 
<4.0 mEq/L  
Run-in failed subject s cannot  be randomized but may be re screened  once, after 
3 months  (Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ). 
Treatment Phase  (Double -Blind ed): 

 
 
PAT -CR-302  
Protocol Version 4.0, 23 June 2021  Page 16 of 139 
 After the Run -in Phase  (single -blind ed), eligible subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 
ratio, to treatment with patiromer or placebo  double -blind ed; see Study  Schema . 
Randomized subjects will begin  their assigned  treatment (patiromer or placebo ), 
double -blind ed, using the same number of packets established for patiromer at the 
end of the Run -in Phase and will continue the ACEi/ARB/ARNi  and MRA  regimen 
being administered at the end of the Run -in Phase.  Anytime during the Treatment 
Phase when subjects are on less t han the target dose of either ACEi/ARB/ARNi or 
MRA, up -titration should be attempted if serum K+ remains in the normokalemic 
range (serum K+ 4.0–5.0 mEq/ L) and no other contravening conditions are present . 
After randomization, serum K+ will be measured  prior to initiation of  assigned 
patiromer/placebo , double -blind ed, on Treatment Day 1/Baseline  (if not already 
obtained that day) , and at each subsequent scheduled and unscheduled visit during 
the Treatment  Phase . 
Protocol allowed interventions for the management of hyperkalemia during the 
Treatment Phase include the following:  
• Up-titration of patiromer/placebo if on <3 packets per day  
• Down -titration or discontinuation of ACEi, ARB,  ARNi and/or MRA  
• Initiate or i ncrease diure tics 
• Dietary K+ restriction  
If local K+ is >5.5  mEq/L  one or more of these interventions must be initiated  either 
individually or in combination following the recommendations by [CONTACT_571602] . Repeat the K+ measurement within 7 days; if local K+ 
remains >5.5  mEq/L consider repeating the intervention or using other interventions  
in the order described above . 
If local K+ is between ≥5.0 mEq/L and ≤5.5 mEq/L  one or more of these interventions 
may be initiated per Investigator discretion.  
Urgent treatment of hyperkalemia should be in accordance with  usual care and the 
Investigator’s judgment.  As described in Section [IP_ADDRESS] , the only K+ binding 
medications permitted for use during the study are temporary use of sodium or 
calcium polystyrene sulfonate as well as  sodium zirconium cyclosilicate for up to 
7 days or until  local serum  K+ <5.0 mEq/L, whichever occurs first.  Patiromer/placebo 
must be withheld during temporary use of permitted K+ binding medications.  
If hypokalemia develops during the Treatment Phase, study drug should be 
down -titrated (lowest acceptable dose is 0 pack ets/day) until local serum K+ ≥4.0 
mEq/L.  
Samples will be collected at each scheduled visit, at minimum,  for the measurement 
of serum K+ and creatinine (for calculation of eGFR). Subject reported outcome will 
be assessed using the  KCCQ  and EQ -5D-5L questionnaire . See  Schedule of Events  
for full details of protocol required procedures and laboratory assessments at the 
applicable visits (and timings of each visit).  

 
 
PAT -CR-302

  Monitorin g Changes in Renal Function:  
Throughout the study, creatinine will be measured at each study visit (and may be 
measured at unscheduled visits). Subjects must be monitored for changes in renal 
function (eGFR and creatinine), especially during periods of medication changes or 
adjustment s and when the subject has a change in clinical status. See Section 6.7.4  
for suggested guidance on medication adjustments based on changes in rena l 
function.  
Sample Size:  The sample size of 410 subjects per treatment arm (total of 820 subjects) has been 
calculated to provide 90% power to detect a difference between the control group 
(placebo) and the active group (patiromer) on the  mean change in K+ levels from 
Baseline . This sample size calculation was based upon the following assumptions : 
alpha level of 5% ( 2-sided ), a difference between group means of 0.[ADDRESS_750467] 
deviation  (SD)  of 0.5  and a 5% rate of loss to follow -up 
Study Sites:  Approximately 375 sites 
Statistical 
Methods:  The mean change in serum K+ levels from Baseline is analyzed by [CONTACT_3553] a mixed 
model for repeated measures (MMRM) approach including all available follow -up 
data. A Gaussian linear model for repeated measures with treatment, geographic 
region, sex, baseline Type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) statu s, and visit as factors, and 
baseline K+ level, baseline eGFR as covariates. The error terms are assumed to follow 
a multivariate normal distribution with unstructured covariance.  
Sensitivity analy ses for the primary endpoint will explore changes in treat ment effect 
over follow -up time by [CONTACT_571603] -
mentioned model. In addition, sensitivity analyses accounting for potentially 
informative missingness will be based upon a Win Ratio approach.  
Secondary efficacy end points will be tested in the order listed (i.e., fixed -sequence  
method to  preserve the family -wise error rate ) and summarized  descriptively through 
the calculation of point estimates by [CONTACT_73332]  95% ICIs for the 
treatment differences. Other endpoints will be summarized using  the calculation of 
point estimates by [CONTACT_73332] 95% CIs for the treatment differences 
and descriptive methods  as appropriate . 
Safety evaluations include A Es and serious adverse events ( SAEs ) (including 
all-cause mortality); slope of  eGFR change during the study; decline in eGFR >50% 
or ESRD, renal death, or need  for dialysis; and serum K+ level. Safety variables will 
be summarized using the  safety set. 
No interim analysis is planned.  
See Section 12 for additional information.

2 Subjects with 2 screening K+ values >5.0  mEq/L are considered hyperkalemic; these patients begin patiromer when they qualify for the Run -in Phase (i.e., on the same day Run -in qualification is met or the 
next day). All other subjects are considered normoka lemic and  will begin patiromer latest by [CONTACT_571604]-in Phase  only if they are still normokalemic or progressed to 
hyperkalemia . Note: Depending on the actual local serum K+ value this could include patiromer 0  g/day (i.e ., 0 packet s/day).  During the Run -in Phase , after any adjustments of patiromer (up or down) subjects 
must return within 1  week  ±3 days to assess their serum K+ level. See Section [IP_ADDRESS]  for details.  
3 Occurs after discontinuation of patiromer during the Run -in Phase (Run -in Phase failed) and after discontinuation from patiromer/placebo  during  Treatment Phase ; see Section 8.6. 
4 If the PA Visit is 2 weeks after the EoS Visit, then the Follow -up Phone Call is not required.  
5 Any other study assessments (see Section 8.8) may be performed at the discretion of the Investigator during a n unscheduled visit. 
6 See Section 5.4 for the assessment of the randomization criteria . 
7 Assessment is optional.  
8 If hemolysis of the local sample is detected or is suspected (see Section 9.1.1 ), or the initial 2 screening blood samples reveal inconsistent values not allowing to clearly define hyperkalemia or normokal emia, 
a repeat (third) K+ measurement from a separate blood draw w ill be performed within [ADDRESS_750471] 2 local samples  at Screening , each obtained from a separate venipuncture (e.g., one in each arm  or 2 separate venipunctures in the same arm ) to determine normokalemia or hyperkalemia in both blood 
samples; in case of deviant results, another blood sample is to be taken within [ADDRESS_750472] be taken in the morning before blood withdrawal for analysis of MRA levels . 
18 Performed at  3 months  (i.e., Week 18) , 6 months, 12 months, and then every 12 months thereafter.  
19 Subjects will complete the KCCQ and EQ -5D-5L questionnaire before study staff performs any clinic or study assessments.  
20 During Run -in Phase, only patiromer is dispensed. After randomization, p atiromer/placebo dose on Day 1/ Baselin e will be the same number of packets established for patiromer at the end of the Run -in 
Phase . Throughout the study patiromer or patiromer/placebo  will be dispensed as needed . 
21 Only if needed for subjects who initiate spi[INVESTIGATOR_571554] -in Phase ; see Section 6.7.2  and Section  6.8.2 . 
22 Screening 12-lead ECG and BNP/NT -proBNP needs to be assessed on the same day . 
23 For subjects treated with ARNi (sacubitril/valsartan) in the previous 4 weeks before Screening only NT-proBNP values are to be considered . 
24 Applicable only if IMP is dispensed at an unscheduled visit.

 1. INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND  
1.1 Background of the Disease and Treatment Options  
Twenty -six (26) million people worldwide have a diagnosis of HF [5]. In their Heart 
Disease and Stroke Statistics —2017 Update, the American Heart Association (AHA) 
reported data from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2011 –2014, which 
estimates that 6.5 million Americans ≥[ADDRESS_750479] HF. Projections show that with 
improved survival and the aging of the population, the prevalence of HF in the US will 
increase 46% from 2012 to 2030, resulting in more than 8  million people ≥[ADDRESS_750480] shown 
reductions in CV mortality, reductions in HF hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], and improvements in patient 
quality of life be used and optimally implemented [6,7,8]. Renal i nsufficiency is common 
in HF and is independently associated with increased all -cause and CV mortality [ 9]. 
However , in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease  (CKD)  (eGFR <30 
mL/min/1.73  m2) evidence -based strategies for improving CV outcomes remain almost 
unavailable [ 10]. 
HF mortality remains high. Approximately 50% of people diagnosed with HF will die 
within [ADDRESS_750481] 20 years, and this has been 
primarily because of evidence -based approaches to treating HF risk  factors and 
comorbidities, as well as use of ACEi, beta-blocker , MRA , coronary revascularization, 
implantable cardioverter -defibrillators, and cardiac resynchronization therapeutic 
strategies [6]. 
However, evidence suggests that these treatments are not being implemented as 
recommended in HF treatment guidelines. Data from the Get With The Guidelines -Heart 
Failure (GWTG -HF) registry suggests that approximately 47% of individuals admitted to 
the hosp ital with HF should have had initiation of at least 1 new medication on discharge. 
The GWTG -HF registry 2008 –2013 collected prescribing, indications, and 
contraindications for ACEi or ARB , beta-blocker , MRA, hydralazine/isosorbide dinitrate, 
and anticoagul ants. The difference between a patient’s medication regimen at hospi[INVESTIGATOR_571556]. Among 158,922 patients from 271 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_66386] a primary discharge diagnosis 
of HF, initiat ion of ACEi/ARB was indicated in 18.1% of all patients, 55.5% of whom had 
not been receiving ACEi/ARB at admission. B eta-blockers  were indicated in 20.3%, 50.5% 
of whom had not been receiving beta-blockers  at admission, and initiation of MRA was 
indicated in 24.1%, 87.4% of whom had not been receiving MRA at admission. A quarter 
of patients hospi[INVESTIGATOR_571557] [ADDRESS_750482] earned Class I recommendations in the HF treatment guidelines 
[7-11]. 

 
 
PAT -CR-[ADDRESS_750483] been seen in the European Society of Cardiology  Heart Failure 
Long -Term Registry. In patients with chronic H FrEF, renin -angiotensin system blockers, 
beta-blockers , and MRA were used in 92.2, 92.7, and 67.0% of patients, respectively. 
About 70% of patients did not receive the target dosage of these drug s [14]. Among reasons 
for non -adherence  or not achieving the target dose with ACEi, ARB, or MRA were 
contraindication or lack of tolerance, most often due to worsening renal function, 
symptomatic hypotension, or hyperkalemia. The reduction in renal function associated with 
HF, older age, and co morbidities such as diabetes mellitus hampers K+ excretion and so 
make s patients with HF more likely to develop hyperkalemia. Additionally, the 
guideline -recommended pharmacologic treatments, which include multiple neurohormonal 
antagonists of the renin -angiotensin -aldosterone system (RAAS), increase the risk of 
hyperkalemia, especially when used in combination [15]. 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_571558], evidence -based strategies for improving CV 
outcomes in patients with advanced CKD remain almost unavailable [ 10]. This is in part 
because the efficacy and safety studies that support drug approval typi[INVESTIGATOR_571559] ; although criteria vary, typi[INVESTIGATOR_571560] [ADDRESS_750484] 
been done [ 16]. 
Patients with severe renal insufficiency  have  generally been excluded from the RAASi 
outcomes trials. Thus, eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m2, i.e., CKD Stages 4 and 5 (Europe), 
constitutes contraindications or cautions  when initiating RAASi medication [ 17]. For 
example, cautious use or avoidance of MRAs is recommended in H FrEF patients with 
eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m2 or serum K+ >5 mEq/L [ 12,13]. 
New K+ binders might also enable study of patients that have been excluded or 
underrepresented in RAASi clinical trials, e.g. , those with eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m2 or 
serum K+ >5.0–5.5 mEq/L  [18]. K+ binders may be used to study the potential benefit of 
RAASi in populations not studied in the past due to the risk of hyperkalemia, for examp le, 
in patients with eGFR <30 m L/min/1.73 m2. Also, K+ binders may enable investigating the 
benefit of higher doses MRA therapy [ 19]. 
Epstein et al, 2 015 examined renin -angiotensin -aldosterone -system inhibitor ( RAASi ) dose 
levels in a US patient population. They investigated the impact of hyperkalemia on RAASi 
dose and the association between dose levels and clinical outcomes [20]. Patients were 
classified by [CONTACT_571605], HF, or diabetes and RAASi dose level at index date, as 
determined by [CONTACT_571606] (supramaximal  = above labeled  dose; maximal  = 
labeled  dose; submaximal  = less than labeled  dose; or discontinued). One-third (32.8%) of 
all qualifying subjects experienced at least 1 hyperkalemic event (serum K+ >5.0 mEq/L). 
Among subjects with HF and Stage 3 –4 CKD, maximum doses were prescribed in 19% of 
subjects; 64% of subjects were p rescribed submaximal doses, and 16% of patients 
discontinued treatment with RAAS i medications as of the index date. Analysis of RAASi 
dosing before and after hyperkalemia events revealed that a substantial proportion of 

 
 
PAT -CR-302  
Protocol Version 4.0, 23 June 2021  Page 32 of 139 
 subjects had changes in their dose f ollowing an epi[INVESTIGATOR_571561] K+, with dose 
changes occurring more frequently after moderate -to-severe hyperkalemia events 
(serum  K+ >5.5 mEq/L). Patients on a maximum dose of a RAASi were down -titrated to a 
submaximal dose or discontinued the RAAS i nearly half the time (47%) after 
moderate -to-severe hyperkalemia events and 38% of the time after mild events. Among 
patients on submaximal doses of RAAS i, moderate -to-severe hyperkalemia events were 
followed by [CONTACT_571607] 55% of pati ents and discontinuation in 27% 
of patients, compared with dose maintenance in 61% after mild hyperkalemia events and 
discontinuation in 24% after mild events. Nearly 60% of subjects with HF who 
discontinued RAAS i experienced an adverse outcome or mortalit y compared with 52.3% 
of patients on submaximal doses and 44.3% of patients on maximum doses (all 
comparisons p<0.05). Patients on submaximal doses or who discontinued RAASi therapy 
showed consistently worse outcomes compared with patients on maximum doses , 
irrespective of comorbidity status (CKD, HF, diabetes mellitus) or patient age [20], 
suggesting that patients may benefit from continuing maximal, guideline -directed doses of 
medications, if hyperkalemia can be managed.  
Although these data are taken from a retrospective dat abase analysis with many limitations, 
they are consistent with other observational and retrospective studies [11,14,21,22,23] that 
have reported a meaningful gap between recommendations in guidelines and real -world 
practice. Closing this gap between the number of guideline -RAASi -eligible patients with 
HFrEF and the actual number receiving RAASi may provide an opportunity to further 
reduce CV mortality, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_571562] (including HF), and healthcare costs.  
New treatments for hyperkalemia may offer a solution to intolerance or contraindication 
due to hyperkalemia while on RAASi medications and may help close this gap. Veltassa® 
(patiromer) for Oral Suspension is a non -absorbed, polymeric K+ binder that is approved 
for the treat ment of hyperkalemia [24]. 
1.2 Summary of Clinical Data  
In a Phase 3 study (RLY5016 -301) CKD patients on RAAS i with serum  K+ levels  
≥5.1-<6.5 mEq/L (n=243) received patiromer (8.4  g daily initially) for 4 weeks ( Initial 
Treatment Phase); the primary efficacy endpoint was mean change in serum K+ from 
Baseline to Week 4. Eligible patients (those with Baseline K+ ≥5.5-<6.5 mEq/L and levels 
≥3.8–<5.1 mEq/L at the end of Week 4) entered an 8 -week randomized withdrawal phase 
and were randomly assigned to continue patiromer or switch to placebo; the primary 
efficacy endpoint was the change in the serum K+ over the first 4  weeks of that phase. One 
hundred two (102) patients (42%) had HF (per the Investigator’s assessment). A 
prespecified analysis of these subjects demonstrated a mean (±standard error (SE)) change 
in serum K+ from Baseline to Week 4 of -1.06±0.05  mEq/L (95% confidence interval ( CI), 
-1.16, -0.95; p<0.001); 76%  (95%  CI, 69, 84) achieved target serum K+ (3.8-<5.1 mEq/L). 
In the randomized withdrawal phase, the median increase in serum K+ from Baseline  of that 
phase was greater with placebo (n=22) than patiromer (n=27) (p<0.001); recur rent 
hyperkalemia (serum K+ ≥5.5 mEq/L) occurred in 52% on placebo and 8% on patiromer 

 
 
PAT -CR-302  
Protocol Version 4.0, 23 June 2021  Page 33 of 139 
 (p<0.001). By [CONTACT_571608], 55% of HF patients on placebo 
and 100% of HF patients on patiromer were still receiving RAASi [25]. These findings 
support the use of patiromer to manage hyperkalemia in HF patients.  
In addition, the effect of treatment with patiromer for up to 52 weeks was evaluated in an 
open -label study of 304 hyperkalemic patients with CKD and Type 2 diabe tes mellitus on 
RAASi therapy (Study RLY5016 -205). This study demonstrated that the treatment effect 
on serum K+ was maintained during continued therapy. Patiromer was well tolerated over 
this longer treatment period, supporting its use in the management of more chronic 
hyperkalemia seen with RAASi treatment of HF in some subjects [26]. 

 
 
PAT -CR-[ADDRESS_750485] developed 
hyperkalemia (serum K+ >5.0 mEq/L) while being treated with RAASi medications is 
re-designed t o determine if patiromer treatment will result in better K+ control compared 
with placebo treatment.  
The selection criteria for the present  study will provide a cohort of subjects who have risk 
factors for hyperkalemia (e.g., CKD, diabetes mellitus, older age), who have demonstrated 
hyperkalemia and who pose the greatest therapeutic dilemma to clinicians, since they have 
the highest risk of d evelopi[INVESTIGATOR_571563] [27]. 

 
 
PAT -CR-302  
Protocol Version 4.0, 23 June 2021  Page 35 of 139 
 The study includes a single -blinded Run-in Phase and a double -blinded Treatment Phase. 
During the Run -in Phase, doses of RAASi medications will be adjusted consistent with 
guideline therapy, including initiation and up -titration of an MRA . Serum K+ will be 
managed through treatment with patiromer in all subjects during the Run -in Phase. Doses 
of patiromer will be adjusted according to a Sponsor -provided algorithm to maintain serum 
K+ 4.0–5.0 mEq/L.  Mortality is increased on the lower end of the serum  K+ “normal range” 
with K+ values as high as 4.1  mEq/L, so a lower limit of 4.0 mEq/L was chosen for the 
target range [8,28,29]. The 4.0 –5.0 mEq/L target range will allow optimization of HF 
treatment while managing serum K+ in all subjects before randomization. After the Run -in 
Phase, subjects are randomized 1:1 to either continued patiromer treatment (patiromer 
group) or the withdrawal of patiromer (placebo grou p); subjects and site study personnel 
will be blinded to treatment assignment . 
We hypothesize that the ability of patiromer to treat hyperkalemia will allow better 
adherence to HF guidelines in the patiromer arm than in the placebo arm and that this 
difference will lead to a difference in the serum K+ changes from Baseline compared w ith 
placebo .

 4. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN 
4.1 Overall Study Design  
See Study  Schema  for an overview of the  study  design . The study consists of:  
• Screening Phase (the Screening Phase may last up to 10 calendar  days) 
• Run-in Phase  (single -blind ed), up to 12 weeks; weekly visits recommended but are at 
the Investigator’s discretion  
• Treatment Phase  (double -blind ed); the scheduled visits are listed below:  
− Day 1/ Baseline  
− Day 3  (±1 day ) 
− Week 1  (±3 days ) 
− Week 2  (±3 days ) 
− Week 6 (±14 days)  
− Week 18 (−30 days), first Every 3 Months visit  
− Visits every 3 months (−30 days) thereafter through the end of the study  
− EoS Visit  
• Potassium Assessment Visit (occurs within 2 weeks after patiromer  or placebo is 
discontinued)  
Note: Subjects who prematurely discontinue patiromer/placebo during the Blinded 
Treatment Phase remain in the study . 
• Follow -up Phone Call (at least 2 weeks after the EoS for the assessment of safety; for 
subjects who discontinue patiromer at the EoS Visit, and attend the Potassium 
Assessment Visit 2 weeks later, a Follow -up Phone Call will not be needed)  
• Unscheduled Visit (d uring the Treatment Period, anytime there are changes to ACEi, 
ARB, ARNi and/or MRA dose or interventions for serum K+ outside the desired range, 
additional Unscheduled Visits should occur weekly until the ACEi, ARB, ARNi and/or 
MRA dose or serum K+ has be en stable for at least 2 consecutive visits ) 
Screening Phase  and Run-in Phase ( Single -Blinded, Up to 12 Weeks):  
At the end of the Screening Phase , subjects who satisfy the eligibility criteria will be 
enrolled into the Run -in Phase. The purpose of the Run -in Phase is to select subjects who 

 
 
PAT -CR-302  
Protocol Version 4.0, 23 June 2021  Page 40 of 139 
 will potentially benefit from treatment and not unnecessarily expose  those who will not.  In 
addition, the Run -in Phase is for management of serum K+ with patiromer to  allow 
optimization of RAASi medications and their dosage (including initiation of MRA if not 
already receiving an MRA).  
All subjects  who meet the eligibility criteria for  the Run -in Phase will initiate patiromer 
(1 packet/day) , single -blinded. 
Subjects with 2 Screening K+ values >5.0 mEq/L are considered hyperkalemic ; these 
patients begin patiromer when they qualify for the Run -in Phase , i.e., on the same day 
Run-in qualification is met or the next day.  
Note: If one screening K+ value is >5.0  mEq/L  and one value is ≤5.0 mEq/L, then a third 
peripheral venipuncture is performed within [ADDRESS_750486] is 
hyperkalemic or normokalemic  (local serum K+ ≥4.0–≤5.0 mEq/L) . 
All other subjects are considered normokalemic  and serum K+ will be measured again latest 
after the  first week during the Run-in Phase . Patiromer  will be started  at this first  Run-in 
Visit only if subjects are still normokalemic or have progressed to hyperkalemia; in case of 
newly observed hypokalemia  (local serum K+ <4.0 mEq/L)  during the first Run -in Week, 
patiromer must not be given.  In subjects with hypokalemia serum K+ must be controlled 
after [ADDRESS_750487] week of  Run-in, ACEi/ARB/ARNi and/or MRA  doses ideally 
remain unchanged, if clinically indicated. On or after the Run -in Week  1 Visit , up-titration 
of ACEi/ARB/ARNi and/or MRA may be initiated.  
Patiromer is titrated during  Run-in Phase to achieve target local serum K+ level of 
≥4.0-≤5.0 mEq/L ; see Section [IP_ADDRESS]  for patiromer titration algorithm.  Note: Depending 
on the actual local serum K+ value this could include patiromer 0 g/day (i.e., 0  packet s/day) 
during the Run -in Phase.  
Optimization of ACEi/ ARB/ARNi or MRA During Run -in Phase:  
The Investigator should manage ACEi/ARB/ARNi or MRA dose initiation , escalation and 
maintenance with the aim to achieve 100%  of target doses as per the Study Manual,  using 
clinical judgment to customize ACEi/ARB/ARNi or MRA addition or dose escalation 
based on subject response ; see Section 6.7.2 , Section  6.8.2 , and Study Manual [1] for a 
summary of practice guideline recommendations .  
Initiation or escalation of ACEi/ARB/ARNi or MRA dose should be made with caution 
when local serum K+ is >5.0 mEq/L. Assessment of serum K+ will occur at each visit. The 
patiromer dose is titrated based on the subject’s K+ level.  
Subjects may be randomized anytime (but no later than 12 weeks) during the Run -in Phase 
when they meet all of the  randomization  criteria ; see Section  5.4. 

 
 
PAT -CR-302  
Protocol Version 4.0, 23 June 2021  Page 41 of 139 
 Treatment Phase  (Double -Blind ed): 
After the Run -in Phase  (single -blind ed), eligible subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio, 
to treatment with patiromer or placebo  double -blind ed; see Study  Schema . 
Randomized subjects will begin their assigned treatment (patiromer or placebo ) using the 
same number of packets established for p atiromer at the end of the Run -in Phase and will 
continue the ACEi/ARB/ARNi and MRA  regimen being administered at the end of the 
Run-in Phase.  
Anytime during the Treatment Phase when subjects are on less than the target dose of either 
ACEi/ARB/ARNi or MRA, up -titration should be attempted if serum K+ remains in the 
normokalemic range (serum K+ ≥4.0–≤5.0 mEq/ L) and no other contravening conditions 
are present . 
After randomization, serum  K+ will be measured prior to initiation of assigned 
patiromer/placebo , double -blind ed, on Treatment Day  1/Baseline (if not already obtained 
that day), and at each subsequent scheduled and unscheduled visit during the Treatment 
Phase.  See Table 1 for the allowed interventions for the management of hyperkalemia 
during the Treatment Phase . 
Table 1 Protocol Allowed Interventions for the Management of Hyperkalemia 
During the Blinded Treatment Phase  
1. Up-titration of patiromer/placebo if on <3 packets per day  
2. Down -titration or discontinuation of ACEi, ARB, ARNi and/or MRA  
3. Initiate or i ncrease diure tics 
4. Dietary K+ restriction  
Notes:  ACEi=Angiotensin -converting enzyme inhibitor; ARB=Angiotensin II receptor blocker; ARNi=Angiotensin receptor/neprilysin 
inhibitor; K+=Potassium; MRA=Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist . 
 
If local K+ is >5.5 mEq/L, one or more of these interventions must be initiated either 
individually or in combination following the recommendations by [CONTACT_571612] . 
Repeat the K+ measurement within 7 days; if local K+ remains >5.5  mEq/L consider 
repeating the intervention or using other interventions  in the order presented in Table 1. 
If local K+ is between >5.0 mEq/L and 5.5  mEq/L, one or more of these interventions may 
be initiated per Investigator discretion.  
Urgent treatment of hyperkalemia should  be in accordance with  usual care and the 
Investigator’s judgment . As described in Section [IP_ADDRESS] , the only K+ binding medications 
permitted for use during the study are temporary use of sodium or calcium polystyrene 
sulfonate  as well as sodium zirconium cyclosilicate  for up to 7 days  or until local serum K+ 

 
 
PAT -CR-302  
Protocol Version 4.0, 23 June 2021  Page 42 of 139 
 <5.0 mEq/ L, whichever occurs first . Patiromer/placebo must be withheld during temporary 
use of permitted K+ binding medications . 
If hypokalemia develops during the Treatment Phase, study drug should be down -titrated 
(lowest acceptable dose is 0 packets/day) until local serum K+ ≥4.0 mEq/L.  
Samples will be collected at each scheduled visit, at minimum, for the measurement of 
serum K+ and creatinine (for calculation of eGFR). Subject reported outcome will be 
assessed using the KCCQ  and EQ -5Q-5L. See  Schedule of Events  for full details of 
protocol required procedures and laboratory assessments at the applicable visits (and 
timings of each visit).  
4.[ADDRESS_750488]’ s participation includes a Screening  Phase (within a maximum of 
10 calendar  days), Run-in Phase ( single -blind ed, up to 12 weeks) followed by [CONTACT_571613] ( double -blind ed, variable per subject).  Study duration for individual 
subjects will vary, depending on their individual enrollment date . The common EoS will 
occur when [ADDRESS_750489] been enrolled  in order for 
820 subjects to reach the Week 6 visit . Sites will be notified of the common EoS date prior 
to study closure and should advise ongoing study subjects of the study termination date 
thereafter ; see Section 8.4 for detailed description of the EoS procedures.  
Patients  who prematurely discontinue patiromer/placebo  will remain in the study for the 
collection of composite  endpoint event data  up to and i ncluding  the common EoS and will 
receive usual care during the study phase .

* Study -specific target doses as per Table 4 in the Study Manual . 
5.5 Discontinuing Patiromer/Placebo or Withdrawal of Subjects  
5.5.1 Discontinuation from Patiromer/Placebo  
The management of ACEi/ARB/ARNi and/or MRA  are at the discretion of the Investigator 
during the Blinded Treatment Phase. If one or more ACEi/ARB/ARNi and/or MR A are 
adjusted , patiromer/placebo may be adjusted according ly, based on changes in local serum 
K+ levels . The lowest dose of patiromer/placebo is 0 packets/day . It is recommended to 
discuss with the subject a study treatment interruption (dose level 0 packet s/day)  rather than 
a permanent patiromer/placebo discontinuation , which  should only occur when it is 
requested by [CONTACT_571614] . 
Subjects who discontinue from patiromer/placebo treatment after randomization and prior 
to completion of the study will be encouraged to return within 2 weeks , or as soon as 
possible thereafter, for a Potassium Assessment  Visit ( see Section 8.6). Subjects who 

 
 
PAT -CR-302  
Protocol Version 4.0, 23 June 2021  Page 47 of 139 
 discontinue from patiromer/placebo treatment after randomization and prior to the common 
EoS will continue in the study for collection of composite  endpoint  events. These subjects 
will be treated in accordance with the standard of care per the Investigator’s judgment.  
Note : Subjects who discontinue from patiromer during  the Run -in Phase will also be 
encouraged to return for a Potassium Assessment Visit within  2 weeks, or as soon as 
possible thereafter.  
5.5.2 Withdrawal from Study  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Withdrawal of Consent  
Within the provisions of informed consent and good clinical judgment with respect to the 
subject’s safety, every attempt should be made to have subjects complete both the 
Treatment Phase and the Potassium Assessment Visit after discontinuation of 
patiromer /placebo . Subjects will be informed that they will be free to withdraw from the 
study at any time. However, should a subject withdraw, every effort will be made to 
determine the reason why the subject has withdrawn his/her consent. Although subjects 
will n ot be obliged to give a reason for withdrawing consent, the Investigator will use best 
effort s to obtain the reason, while fully respecting the subject’s rights. Reasons for 
withdrawal of consent, when provided by [CONTACT_423], will be recorded in the eCRF,  and 
every effort should be made by [CONTACT_571615] ( ET) (Section  8.5). Every effort will be made to contact a 
subject who fails to attend a study visit, in order to ensure that the subject is in satisfactory 
health.  
The subject who wishes to withdraw consent will be offered the opportunity to  withdraw 
consent only partially  and to accept any or all of  the following : 
• Providing information about his/her own health status by [CONTACT_571616] 
• Allow ing Primary Care physicians or family to be contact [CONTACT_571617]’s health status  
• Allowing [ADDRESS_750498] at the end of the study (at or after the EoS) 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Investigator -Withdrawn Subject  
The Investigator and/or the Medical Monitor may exercise his or her medical judgment to 
terminate a subject’s participa tion in the study if they determine that the subject’s continued 
participation in the study is a potential safety concern , related to e .g., subject ’s 
non-adherence to the study protocol, subject ’s non -compliance to study medication, any 
medical condition that the Investigator or Sponsor determines may jeopardize the subject ’s 
safety if he or she continues in the study, subject ’s excessive drug/alcohol abuse . The 
Investigator  may also terminate a subject’s participation due to any condition preventing 
complete participation in the trial procedures, or potentially jeopardizing the quality of the 
study data.  The Investigator will immediately inform the Medical Monitor of plans for early 

 
 
PAT -CR-[ADDRESS_750499] from the study. Investigator -withdrawn subjects will  also be offered 
the opportunity to consent to the 3 options described above . All subjects withdrawn early 
from the study for any reason will complete the procedures described for ET (Section  8.5) 
and be followed for safety after receiving the last dose of study medications. Randomized 
subjects withdrawn from the study for any reason will not be replaced.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  All Early Withdrawal Subjects  
For any subject who early terminates from the study  (including subjects who withdraw their 
consent) , survival information may be ascertained via public database search  at the end of 
the study .

(DSMB ) and Sponsor’s Drug Safety staff in situations where unblinding is necessary to 
comply with regulatory requirements . 
Clinical Trial Supply Management will have a ccess to overall patiromer/placebo usage for 
management of patiromer/placebo packaging and distribution activities and oversight of 
patiromer/placebo stock levels at drug depots and study sites.  
If the Investigator  or site study staff  becomes aware of a subject’s study treatment 
assignment, efforts should be made to not disclose treatment assignments to other study 
staff, subjects, or their caregivers. Blinded Sponsor  staff will also remain blinded to 
treatment assignment.  
The Investiga tional Pharmacist or the qualified designee as assigned by [CONTACT_571618]  (IMP) 
handling and should not be involved in any other study procedures (see Section  6.5 for 
more details ). 
Subjects will be instructed to refrain from discussion of their study drugs with the site staff 
(except with the Investigational Pharmacist or the qualified designee  as assi gned by [CONTACT_189645] ) or other subjects, and that any questions regarding the study drug 
should be directed to the Investigational Pharmacist or the qualified designee as assigned 
by [CONTACT_571619].  
6.1.[ADDRESS_750501] that the blind be broken 
if it is considered important to the management of the medical emergency. In such cases, 
the Investigator will be unblinded via the interactive web response system (IWRS ). The 
Investigator should make every reasonable attempt to notify  study Medical Monitor before 
breaking the blind. The Investigator may inform the subject and/or his/her treating 
physician of the treatment assignment . 
Other situations where unblinding may be necessary are for study -specific suspected 
unexpected serious adverse reaction ( S[LOCATION_003]R ) and aggregate safety reporting to health

The starting dose will be 1 packet/day and may be taken either with food or without food . 
Based upon the K+ management  algorithm s (Section  [IP_ADDRESS]  and Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ), 

 
 
PAT -CR-302  
Protocol Version 4.0, 23 June 2021  Page 51 of 139 
 patiromer/placebo may be increased by [ADDRESS_750502] 1  week 
(±3 days) . For subjects who become hypokalemic  (K+ <4.0 mEq/ L), patiromer /placebo  
must be decreased to a minimum of 0 packets/day (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] ). If serum K+ 
increases from <4.0 –≥4.0 mEq/L and remains between ≥4.0–≤5.0 mEq/L, 
patiromer/placebo must not be resumed yet. Resume patiromer /placebo only when K+ >5.0 
mEq/ L to prevent re -inducing or aggravating hypokalemia . Doses of patiromer/placebo will 
be 0 packets/day, 1 packet/day, 2  packets/day, and 3 packets/day (maximum dose).  
Patiromer/placebo are for oral administration only. Each dose must be prepared 
immediately prior to administration. Patiromer/placebo should be taken at least 3  hours 
before or 3  hours after administration of other orally admi nistered medications . 
Patiromer/placebo should be taken once daily, and preferably at the same time of day, 
consistently. An accidentally missed dose can be taken later on the same day but shall not 
be taken the next day. At the discretion of the Investiga tor, the following drugs may be 
co-administered  with patiromer /placebo : allopurinol, amlodipi[INVESTIGATOR_050], amoxicillin, api[INVESTIGATOR_3822], 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], atorvastatin, cephalexin, cinacalcet, clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745], digoxin, furosemide, glipi[INVESTIGATOR_7130], 
lisinopril, lithium, metoprolol, phenytoin, rivaroxaban, spi[INVESTIGATOR_8407], trimethoprim, 
valsartan, verapamil, and warfarin  (see the Investigator’s Brochure  (IB), Version 1 3.0, 
dated 15 July 20 20, for additional information  [30]). 
Patiromer/placebo suspension must  not be heated (e.g., microwaved) or added to heated 
foods or liquids. Patiromer/placebo must  not be taken in its dry form but must be mixed 
with water, apple, or cranberry juice only.  Prepare p atiromer /placebo doses following the 
steps below:  
• Measure 1/3  cup (approximately 80  mL) of water. Pour half of the water into a glass, 
then add the contents  of the  prescribed  number of patiromer /placebo  packets and stir. 
Add the remaining half of the water and stir thoroughly. The powder will not dissolve, 
and the mixture will look cloudy. Add more water to the mixture as needed for desired 
consistency  
• Drink the mixture immediately. If powder remains in the glass after drinking, add more 
water, stir, and drink immediately. Repeat as needed to ensure the entire dose is 
administered  
6.4 Package and Labeling  
Patiromer powder for oral suspension or placebo will be provided by [CONTACT_115015] a 
blinded manner  as kits labeled for clinical trial use only. Each Run -in kit contains packets 
of patiromer , and these kits are only dispensed during the Run -in Phase  (single -blind ed for 
the subject) . Each Treatment kit contains packets  of either patiromer or placebo , and these 
kits are only dispensed in during the Treatment Phase  (double -blind ed). Additional details 
are provided in the Pharmacy Manual.  

 
 
PAT -CR-[ADDRESS_750503] will be assigned (blinded) to 1 of the 2 treatment groups  via IWRS : 
• Patiromer  
• Placebo  
Upon enrol lment  into the Run -in Phase of the study, each subject will be provided with 
instructions on proper dosing of patiromer  and individualized instructions on when to take 
patiromer  and other concomitant medications after considering the subject’s current 
medication regimen, patiromer instructions regarding administration, and subject 
preference ; see Section 7.1. The subject will be instructed to follow the agreed dosing 
instructions for the remainder of the study to encourage compliance. The Investigator will 
determine if the study drug dosing instr uction requires changes at each visit and any 
changes will be communicated to the subject.  
For subjects who qualify for the Blinded Treatment Phase, subjects will be randomized to 
either patiromer or placebo  on Day 1/Baseline  via IWRS . The study drug will be dispensed 
to subjects by [CONTACT_571620],  or the qualified designee  as assigned by [CONTACT_189645] . 
Subjects will also be instructed to discard all used/empty packets but to bring back any 
unopened packets to the next visit for compliance assessment  during both the Run -in and 
Blinded Treatment Phases . Subjects will be instructed to return the unopened ( unused) 
patiromer /placebo packets in the outer packaging (boxes) in which they were originally 
provided. The Investigational Pharmacist or the qualified designee  as assigned by [CONTACT_571621] /placebo according to the 
protoc ol instructions.  
Compliance will be documented  and assessed on the basis of the prescribed number of 
patiromer/placebo  packets , the duration of treatment, and the quantity of dispensed and 
returned  unused packets . The Investigational Pharmacist or the qualified designee  as 
assigned by [CONTACT_571622] (e.g., <80% of expected usage) are identified so that the subject can be retrained on 
proper dosing and administration.

 6.6 Site Supply, Stora ge, Accountability  
6.6.1 Site Supply  
Once a site has been approved to receive study drug, the site will be supplied with an initial 
shipment  of patiromer /placebo  sufficient for [ADDRESS_750504] or qualified designee as assigned by [CONTACT_571623]/placebo.  
Patiromer/placebo will be shipped and stored under refrigeration (2 –8 degrees Celsius) ; see 
the Pharmacy Manual for additional details . Upon dispensation to a subject, 
patiromer/placebo should ideally be kept refrigerated at  2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F) if 
possible, but if stored at ambient room temperature (<25°C (<77°F)) patiromer/placebo 
must be used within 3 months of being taken out of the refrigerator [24]. All study drugs 
will be stored in a secure location. No subject other than those enrolled in this specific 
clinical study are allowed to take patiromer/placebo provided for this study. 
Patiromer/placebo provided for this study must not be utilized for any laboratory or animal 
research.  
6.6.[ADDRESS_750505] 
dispensed to them (including unused packets and all containers) at each  scheduled  visit. All 
used containers will be retained at the site by [CONTACT_571620]/qualified 
designee  as assigned by [CONTACT_571624]’s verification. 
Investigational product accountability and compliance for all investigational products will 
be performed by [CONTACT_571625].  
6.7 Drug Dose Modification  
6.7.1 Management of Serum K+ 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Management of Serum K+ in the Run -in Phase  (Single -Blinded)  
During the Screening Phase , subjects who satisfy the eligibility criteria will be enrolled into 
the Run -in Phase. The purpose of the Run -in Phase is for management of serum K+ with 
patiromer to allow optimization of RAASi medications (including initiation of MRA if not 
already rece iving an MRA).  
All subjects who meet the eligibility criteria for the Run -in Phase (single -blinded) will 
initiate patiromer (1 packet/day).  

 
 
PAT -CR-302  
Protocol Version 4.0, 23 June 2021  Page 54 of 139 
 Subjects with 2 Screening K+ values >5.0  mEq/L are considered hyperkalemic ; these 
subject s begin patiromer when they qualify for the Run -in Phase, i.e., on the same day 
Run-in qualification is met or the next day.  
All other subjects are considered normokalemic  and serum K+ will be measured again latest 
after the first week during the Run -in Phase. Patiromer will be started at this Week [ADDRESS_750506] progressed to hyperkalemia; in case of 
newly observed hypokalemia  (local serum K+ <4.0 mEq/L)  during the first Run -in Week, 
patiromer must not be given. In subjects with hypokalemia serum K+ must be controlled 
after 3 days.  
Note: If one screening K+ value is >5.0  mEq/L and one value is ≤5.0 mEq/L, then a third 
peripheral venipuncture is performed within [ADDRESS_750507] is 
hyperkalemic or normokalemic (local serum K+ ≥4.0-≤5.0 mEq/L).  
During the first Run -in Week, ACEi/ARB/ARNi and/or MRA  doses ideally remain 
unchanged, if clinically indicated. On or after the initial first week visit during the Run -in 
Phase, up -titration of ACEi/ARB/ARNi and/or MRA  may be initiated.  
Patiromer is titrated during Run -in Phase to achieve target local serum K+ level of 
≥4.0-≤5.0 mEq/L (see below).  
Note: Depending on the actual local serum K+ value this could include patiromer 0 g/day 
(i.e., 0  packet s/day) during the Run-in Phase.  
• If local serum K+ is >5.0 mEq/L, up -titrate patiromer in at least (≥) 1-week intervals by 
1 packet/day (maximum dose is 3 packets/day)  
− If subject is taking maximum dose patiromer (3 packets/day) and local serum K+ 
remains >5.0 mEq/L during the Run -in Phase, then subject is Run -in failed  
• If local serum K+ is >5.0 –≤5.5 mEq/L and the reduction in serum K+ from the previous 
visit was ≥0.4 mEq/L, at the Investigator’s discretion, a dose increase may not be 
required  
• If local serum K+ is ≥4.3–≤5.0 mEq/L at the first week during the Run -in Phase, 
patiromer must be started at  1 packet/day  
• If local serum K+ is ≥4.0–<4.3 mEq/L at the first week during the Run -in Phase, 
patiromer may be started at  1 packet/day; initiation or increase of patiromer dose should 
be made with caution when local serum K+ is ≥4.0–<4.3 mEq/L to avoid inducing 
hypokalemia  

 
 
PAT -CR-302  
Protocol Version 4.0, 23 June 2021  Page 55 of 139 
 • If local serum K+ decreases from >4.3 mEq/L to values <4.3 mEq/L,  remaining 
≥4.0 mEq/L,  patiromer may be down -titrated by 1  packet/day (minimum dose is 0  
packets/day) ; in case of a reversal of this decrease  from  <4.3 mEq/L but remaining 
≥4.0 mEq/L to values  ≥4.3 mEq/L at following visits , patiromer may be up -titrated by 
1 packet/day ; subject s must receive at least 1  packet/day at serum K+ ≥4.3–≤5.0 mEq/L  
− If 1 week after reducing patiromer to 0  packet s/day local serum K+ remains stable 
≥4.0–≤4.3 mEq/L, optimize RAASi dose and resume patiromer at  1 packet/day 
before considering these subjects as Run -in failed; initiation or increase of 
patiromer dose should be made with caution when local serum K+ is 
≥4.0-≤4.3 mEq/L to avoid inducing hypokalemia  
• If local serum K+ is <4.0 mEq/L, patiromer must be down -titrate d to 0 g/day (i.e., 
0 packets /day),  with confirmation of hypokalemia within [ADDRESS_750508] (≥) 1-week intervals until serum K+ is ≥4.0 mEq/L. Resume patiromer only  when 
local serum K+ rises to >5.0  mEq/L  
− If 2 weeks after taking the minimum 0  packet s/day, local serum K+ remains 
<4.0 mEq/L during the Run -in Phase, then subject is Run -in failed  
Once a subject meets all  randomization criteria (see Section 5.4), they  may be randomized 
into the Treatment Phase  (double -blind ed). 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Management of Serum K+ in the Treatment Phase (Double -Blinded)  
After the Run -in Phase  (single -blind ed), eligible subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio, 
to treatment with patiromer or placebo  (double -blind ed); see Study  Schema . 
Randomized subjects will begin their assigned treatment (patiromer or placebo) , 
double -blind ed, using the same number of packets established for patiromer at the end of 
the Run -in Phase and will continue the ACEi/ARB/ARNi and MRA regimen being 
administered at the end of the Run -in Phase.   
For subjects who are on less than the target dose of either ACEi/ARB/ARNi or MRA, up -
titration should continue if serum K+ remains in the normokalemic range (serum K+ ≥4.0–
≤5.0 mEq/L).  
After randomization, serum K+ will be measured prior to initiation of assigned 
patiromer/placebo , double -blind ed, on Treatment Day  1/Baseline, and at each subsequent 
visit during the Treatment Phase.  
The Investigator may initiate an unscheduled  visit at their discretion throughout the  
Treatment Phase.  
Protocol allowed interventions for the management of hyperkalemia during the Treatment 
Phase include the following:  

 
 
PAT -CR-302  
Protocol Version 4.0, 23 June 2021  Page 56 of 139 
 1. Up-titration of patiromer/placebo if on <3 packets per day  
2. Down -titration or discontinuation of ACEi, ARB, ARNi and/or MRA  
3. Initiate or i ncrease diure tics 
4. Dietary K+ restriction  
If local K+ is >5.5  mEq/L, one or more of these interventions must be initiated either 
individually or in combination following the recommendations by [CONTACT_571612] . 
Repeat the K+ measurement within 7 days; if local K+ remains >5.5  mEq/L consider 
repeating the intervention or using other interventions  in the order described above . 
If local K+ is between >5.0  mEq/L and ≤5.5 mEq/L, one or more of these interventions may 
be initiated per Investigator discretion.  
Urgent treatment of hyperkalemia  is in accordance with usual care and the Investigator’s 
judgment. As described in Section [IP_ADDRESS] , the only K+ binding medications permitted for 
use during the study are temporary use of sodium or calcium polystyrene sulfonate and 
sodium zirconium cyclosilicate for up to 7 days  or until serum K+ is <5.0  mEq/L , or 
whichever occurs first. Patiromer/placebo must  be withheld during temporary use of 
permitted K+ binding medications.  
If hypokalemia develops during the Treatment Phase, study drug should be down -titrated 
(lowest acceptable dose is 0 packets/day) until local serum K+ ≥4.0 mEq/L.  
The Investigator reinitiate s patiromer /placebo  treatment after a temporary interruption of 
dosing  per treatment algorithm described in Section [IP_ADDRESS] . 
6.7.2 Optimization of ACEi/ARB/ARNi or MRA  Medications During 
Run-in Phase  
Because subjects will enter the Run -in Phase on a variety of different ACEi/ARB/ARNi 
and/or MRA  medications , the Investigator will determine how to optimize each subject’s 
ACEi/ARB/ARNi and/or MRA  with the goal of achieving the best guideline -recommended 
HF treatment regimen for the subject and meeting the randomization criteria. The 
Investigator should manage ACEi/ARB/ARNi or MRA dose initiation or escalation to 
achieve 100% of target doses as recommended by [CONTACT_571626]  [1] using clinical 
judgment to customize ACEi/ARB/ARNi or MRA addition or dose escalation based on 
subject response ; see Study Manual  for summary of practice guideline recomme ndations  
and the study -specific target doses .  
Initiation or escalation of ACEi/ARB/ARNi or MRA dose should be made with caution 
when local serum K+ is >5.0 mEq/L. Assessment of serum K+ will occur at each visit. 
Patiromer dose will be titrated as described in Section [IP_ADDRESS]  to achieve and/or maintain 
local serum K+ within the ra nge of ≥4.0–≤5.0 mEq/L during the Run -in Phase.  

 
 
PAT -CR-302  
Protocol Version 4.0, 23 June 2021  Page 57 of 139 
 Subjects may be randomized anytime (but no later than 12  weeks) during the Run -in Phase 
when they meet all of the randomization criteria ; see Section 5.4. Subjects who do not meet 
all of the Randomization criteria within 12 weeks are Run -in failures  and may be rescreened 
after 3 months ( Section [IP_ADDRESS] ). 
Note: For the purpose of this study, m aximum tolerated dose of ACEi/ARB/ARNi or MRA  
is not defined by [CONTACT_496446], but one that is limited by [CONTACT_571627], such 
as renal function decline or symptoms of hypotension. If intolerance of ACEi/ARB/ARNi 
or MRA  is due to K+ level, patiromer should be titrated as described in Section [IP_ADDRESS]  and 
ACEi/ARB/ARNi or MRA  dose increase should be attempted.  
Table 3 describes an example of how ACEi/ARB/ARNi or MRA  could be optimized during 
the Run -in Phase of the study . 
Table 3 Example of ACEi/ARB/ARNi or MRA  Optimization During 
Run-in Phase  
Optimization of ACEi/ARB/ARNi : 
For subjects initiating an ACEi/ARB/ARNi, the Investigator decides which ACEi/ARB/ARNi will be 
started and its dose.  
ACEi/ARB/ARNi can be up-titrated by 50% of the prior dose to achieve  target doses(1) in 1-week intervals, 
as tolerated . 
If the local  serum  K+ is >5.0 mEq/L to ≤5.5  mEq/L, increase the patiromer dose by 1  packet/day (if on 
<3 packets/day); the ACEi/ARB/ARNi dose may be escalated and the patient evaluated at the next 
scheduled visit. If local serum K+ is >5.5  mEq/L, the patiromer dose must be increased by 1 packet/day (if 
on <3  packets/day)  and optionally maintain ing the same  ACEi/ARB/ARNi dose  or decreasing  
ACEi/ARB/ARNi dose . When patiromer titration results in local serum K+ ≤5.0–≥4.0 mEq/L , 
ACEi/ARB/ARNi dose may be escalated if needed . See Section  [IP_ADDRESS]  for titration of patiromer during 
Run-in Phase.  
Optimization of MRA : 
For s ubjects who are not on an MRA at study entry , the Investigator determines which MRA to  initiate , 
e.g., spi[INVESTIGATOR_571566] ; 25 mg/day , or 25 mg/every other day , or 12.5 mg/day , at 
the Investigator’s discretion.  
For subjects who are on <50 mg/day of MRA, double their current dose up to 50  mg/day. Assess tolerance 
to the [ADDRESS_750509]’s serum K+ level as described in 
Section  [IP_ADDRESS] . 
The subject can be randomized when:  
• MRA dose is at least 50 mg/d ay and has been stable for at least 1 week  
• ACEi/ARB/ARNi dose is ≥50% of target dose(1) and has been stable  for at least 1 week  
• Local serum K+ is ≥4.0–≤5.0 mEq/L  
• Patiromer dose is at least 1  packet /day 
1 Study -specific target doses as per Table 4 in the Study Manual.  
Notes:  ACEi=Angiotensin -converting enzyme inhibitor; ARB=Angiotensin II receptor blocker; ARNi=Angiotensin receptor/neprilysin 
inhibitor; MRA=Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist.

 6.7.3 Temporary Interruption or Dose Reduction of HF Medications  
During the  Treatment Phase, temporary interruption or dose reduction of HF medications 
is allowed, with documentation of the reason for the change. HF medications may be 
reinitiated at the time that is deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_737] , and HF medication s 
may be titrated as needed . 
6.7.4 Management of eGFR Level  
Throughout the tre atment period, creatinine will be measured at each study visit (and may 
be measured at Unscheduled Visits). Subjects should be monitored for changes in renal 
function, especially during periods of medication changes or adjustments. Acute reductions 
in glom erular filtration rate have been seen with the initiation of MRA, similar to those 
seen with initiation of ACE i and ARB that have been attributed to transient changes in 
glomerular hemodynamics  [31,32]. These changes typi[INVESTIGATOR_571567] -term renal 
function. In this study, use of the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI ) 
recommendations for the detection and management  of decreases in eGFR when initiating 
or up -titrating ACEi/ARB/ARNi or MRA [33] should be considered.  
Based on KDOQI guidelines:  
• An early decline in eGFR is defined as >15% reduction from Baseline  (Screening)  
within 4 weeks of initiation of ACEi/ARB/ARNi or MRA . 
• For decreases in eGFR up to 30%, no changes to ACEi/ARB/ARNi or MRA dosing 
need to be made, and eGFR may be followed routi nely. 
• Decreases in eGFR >30%, however, should prompt a search for other etiologies of 
abrupt renal function decline, including prerenal and postrenal causes, toxic reactions, 
and renal artery disease . 
• For a decline in eGFR from ≥31–50%, the ACEi/ARB/ARNi or MRA dose should be 
decreased and the eGFR followed weekly. If the eGFR does not return to within 30% 
of Baseline  within 4 weeks, ACEi/ARB/ARNi or MRA should be discontinued . 
• ACEi/ARB/ARNi or MRA should be discontinued for a decline in eGFR  >50% and 
eGFR should be followed at least weekly until eGFR has returned to within 15% of the 
Baseline  value, and biweekly thereafter until stabilized . 
• An eGFR decline >50% must  be reported as an AE ; see Section 10.5 for reporting of 
AEs.  
6.7.5 Usual Care  
During the  Treatment Phase, all subjects will receive usual care in accordance with 
guideline recommendations ; see Study Manual . Usual care includes recommendations for 
all aspects of care for HFrEF patients (i.e., dietary and exercise recommendations, 

 
 
PAT -CR-302  
Protocol Version 4.0, 23 June 2021  Page 59 of 139 
 implantable devices, and procedures  and medications for the management of HF and blood 
pressure).  Usual care may also include patient education. See Section 6.8.4  for additional 
details regarding concomitant medication use.  
6.8 Prohibited Therapy , Special Considerations, and Concomitant 
Treatment  
6.8.1 Prohibited Medications  
During the entire study, the following medications will be prohibited while being treated 
with patiromer/placebo  as these drugs may increase the risk of constipation and/or 
hyperkal emia : 
• Colesevelam  (increased risk of constipation)  
• Colestipol  (increased risk of constipation)  
• Cholestyramine  (increased risk of constipation)  
• Drospi[INVESTIGATOR_187306]  (increased risk of hyperkalemia)  
• Aliskiren or any direct renin inhibitor  (increased risk of hyperkal emia)  
• K+ sparing diuretics such as triamterene and amiloride  (increased risk of hyperkalemia)  
• K+ supplements  (increased risk of hyperkalemia)  
6.8.2 MRA  
In the study  only 2 MRAs are allowed  — spi[INVESTIGATOR_530961]. For subjects  who 
are already taking MRA  at entry into the Run -in Phase, the MRA dose will be managed by 
[CONTACT_737] ; see Section 6.7.2 . In case subjects enter  the Run -in Phase with 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_256813] (any brand), subjects should stay on their initially prescribed 
MRA as long as they follow the guideline recommendat ions. In case subjec ts enter the 
Run-in Phase with an MRA other than spi[INVESTIGATOR_256813] (any brand), subjects 
will have to switch to either of the 2 allowed MRAs to qualify for the Treatment Phase (see 
Randomization Criteria Section 5.4). A change from spi[INVESTIGATOR_571568]. For subjects  who are  not taking an MRA  at 
entry into the Run -in Phase , and the Investigator prescribes spi[INVESTIGATOR_571569] , 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_571570] , but only for these subjects who initiated 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_571571] -in Phase . 
Reimbursement of eplerenone might be considered by [CONTACT_571628] (e.g., male subjec ts who develop breast discomfort or gynecomastia ). 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Potential Interactions with  Spi[INVESTIGATOR_571572], the foll owing interactions described in the 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_571573]:  

 
 
PAT -CR-302  
Protocol Version 4.0, 23 June 2021  Page 60 of 139 
 Digoxin:  
The half -life of digoxin has been shown to be increased by [CONTACT_15209][INVESTIGATOR_8407], which may 
result in increased serum levels of digoxin and may lead to subsequent digitalis toxicity. 
To avoid over - or under -digitalization, subjects taking digoxin should be carefully 
monitored when also taking spi[INVESTIGATOR_8407].  
Lithium:  
The renal clearance of lithium is reduced by [CONTACT_571629], which can lead to a high ri sk 
of lithium toxicity. Generally, lithium should not be taken with diuretics  [34]. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Potential Interactions with Eplerenone  
Because eplerenone metabolism is predominantly mediated via CYP3A4, eplerenone is 
contraindicated in all patients with concomitant administration of strong CYP3A4 
inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, nefazodone, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, 
ritonavir, and nelfinavir).  
Digoxin:  
The systemic exposure of digoxin has been shown to be increased by 16% when 
co-administered with eplerenone, which may lead to subsequent digitalis toxicity. Caution 
is recommended when digoxin is dosed near the upper limit of the  therapeutic window.  
Lithium  
No interaction study has been performed with eplerenone and lithium. If this treatment 
combination is considered necessary, then plasma lithium concentrations should be 
monitored.  
6.8.3 Caution Regarding the Use of NSAIDs or COX -2 Inhibitors  
Nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory drugs ( NSAID s) or cyclooxygenase -2 (COX -2) inhibitors 
are not recommended by [CONTACT_571630], as they increase the risk 
of HF worsening and HF hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  If new medications for mild to moderate pain 
relief are required, NSAIDs and COX -2 inhibitors (except low dose a spi[INVESTIGATOR_248]) should be 
avoided and alternatives such as acetaminophen should be used.  
6.8.4 Concomitant Medications  
Information on concomitant medication (prescription, over -the-counter, herbal and 
naturopathic remedies, etc.) will be collected beginning at  Screening  and continuing for the 
duration of the study (including EoS/ ET Visit , Follow -up Phone Call , and Potassium 
Assessment Visit ; see Section  8.5 and Section  8.6). 
In general, subjects should continue on the same medications and regimens that were 
ongoing at the study entry  with the exception of ACEi/ARB/ARNi and MRA  medications 
(see Section 6.7.2 ). Doses o f these concomitant medications should be kept as stable as 

 
 
PAT -CR-[ADDRESS_750510] or  do not form an exclusion criterion for participation in this study will 
generally be allowed.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Permitted K+ Binding Medications  
Only temporary use of sodium or calcium polystyrene sulfonate as well as sodium 
zirconium cyclosilicate is permitted for up to 7  days or until K+ is <5.0  mEq/L , whichever 
occurs first . During this period patiromer/placebo must be withheld. During the study, t he 
Medical Monitor should be notified  when a subject has been treated with K+ binding 
medications other than patiromer/placebo . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Magnesium Supplements  
The use of magnesium supplementation is allowed during the study and should be 
considered for subjects whose serum magnesium is near or below the low er limit of normal

 7. RISKS/PRECAUTIONS  
7.1 Precautions  
Patiromer should be taken 3 hours before or 3 hours after administration of other 
concomitant medications. At the discretion of the Investigator, the following drugs may be 
co-administered  with patiromer: allopurinol, amlodipi[INVESTIGATOR_050], amoxicillin, api[INVESTIGATOR_3822], aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], 
atorvastatin, cephalexin, cinacalcet, clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745], digoxin, furosemide, glipi[INVESTIGATOR_7130], lisinopril, 
lithium, metoprolol, phenytoin,  rivaroxaban, spi[INVESTIGATOR_8407], eplerenone, trimethoprim, 
valsartan, verapamil, and warfarin.  
Patiromer binds K+ and other cations. In conducted clinical trials with patiromer, 
magnesium was the only other cation with mean decreases in serum levels. Serum 
magnesium values <1.4 mg/d L (0.58 mmol/ L) occurred in 9% of subjects treated with 
patiromer. Mean decreases in serum magnesium were 0.17 mg/d L (0.070 mmol/ L) or less. 
Serum magnesium levels should be monitored in all subjects according to this protocol, and 
magnesium supplementation should be considered in those with low serum magnesium 
levels  at the Investigator’s discretion and per standard of care . 
Studies in healthy adults on K+-controlled diets demonstrated that about 73 mg of calcium 
is absorbed from a maximal 25.2  g daily dose of patiromer. Patiromer at  25.2 g/day 
increased urinary calcium levels by 72.9±23.4 mg/day in healthy individuals who are on a 
1,000 mg/day calcium diet. Based on these findings , Investigators should evaluate the 
benefit/ri sk of continued supplemental calcium in addition to patiromer in each subject in 
the overall context of the subject’s calcium intake, calcium balance, vitamin D status and 
bone health and adjust accordingly  [35]. 
7.[ADDRESS_750511] frequently reported adverse reactions being c onstipation 
(5.9%), diarrhea ( 4.9%), nausea (2.1%),  flatulence ( 2.1%), and hypomagnesemia ( 4.1%) 
[30]. GI disorder reactions were generally mild to moderate in nature, did not appear to be 
dose related, generally resolved spontaneously or with treatment, and none were reported 
as serious. Hyp omagnesemia was mild to moderate, with no subject developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a serum 
magnesium level <1 .0 mg/dL (0.4 1 mmol/L).

 8. STUDY PROCEDURES  
For a detailed schedule of assessments (including all protocol required assessments, visits 
and visit windows) please refer to  the Study  Schema . 
8.1 Screening and Run -in Phase Procedures  (Single -Blinded, Up to 
12 Weeks)  
8.1.[ADDRESS_750512] sign and date a written Informed Consent Form  (ICF) 
approved by [CONTACT_3551] (IRB) or equivalent Ethics Committee (EC) 
(see Section 13.2 for additional requirements). The timing of the Screening Visit (and all 
subsequent visits) must take into account planned ab sences at the research facility and the 
need for study visits according to the Schedule of Events.  Due to the expected waiting 
period of certain assessments (e .g., central laboratory parameters), screening activities can 
be held over different calendar days, but not exceeding 10 calendar  days.  
The subjects will be instructed to arrive at the scheduled time for each Screening Visit to 
allow for completion of all asse ssments including measurement of the K+ level by [CONTACT_27396] . At the Screening Visit, subjects will be assigned a unique subject number, 
which will be generated during Screening Visit registration in IWRS.  
Subjects are first screened to identify t hose who satisfy the eligibility criteria (see 
Section  5.2 and Section  5.3, and Screening activities below ). Once a subject meets all 
eligibility criteria, they will begin the Run -in Phase  (see Section 8.1.2 ). 
The following activities will be performed at  Screening:  
• Subject signs ICF 
• Completion of the KCC Q and EQ -5D-5L questionnaire (must be performed by [CONTACT_571631])  
• IWRS registration  
• Review inclusion and exclusion criteria  
• Collect demographic information  
• Assess NYHA class  
• Review medical/ surgical  history  
• Perform phy sical examination  

 
 
PAT -CR-302  
Protocol Version 4.0, 23 June 2021  Page 64 of 139 
 • Measure weight  and height  
• Measure resting heart rate (pulse) after the subject has been sitting quietly for 5  minutes  
• Measure blood pressure after the subject has been sitting quietly for 5  minutes 
(see Section 9.3.2 ) 
• Perform 12 -lead ECG  
• Collect blood samples (measured locally and/or by [CONTACT_12115] ; see Table 5): 
− The following  serum chemistry assessments will be  measured locally;  only when  
the subject meets all eligibility criteria  will serum chemistry samples be sent to the 
central laboratory:  
• Creatinine , eGFR  
• Alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase  
• BNP  or NT-proBNP  
− K+ level  (measured  locally)  
• 2 samples, each obtained from a separate venipuncture (e.g., one in each arm ) 
− Hematology  (central laboratory only)  
• Collect urine samples for the evaluation of (see Table 5): 
− Urinalysis  
− Urine or serum pregnancy test  
• Dispense urine sample containers for the visit at Week 1 during the Run-in Phase  and 
provide proper training/instructions on use  (see Section  9.6) 
• Assess AE s/special situations  
• Record concomitant medications  and procedures  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Rescreening of Subjects  
Subjects who screen failed may be rescreened twice. The first rescreening must be at least  
[ADDRESS_750513] also fails on the second attempt ( first 
rescreening ), another screening attempt is allowed but must be at least [ADDRESS_750514] after 3 month s from the date 
of Run-in failure . All screening procedures described in Section 8.1.1  will be repeated.  
Subjects can be screened maximum three times in total  as shown in Table 4.

8.1.2 Run-in Phase (Single -Blinded) Procedures  
The purpose of the Run -in Phase is intended for the management of serum K+ with 
patiromer (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] ) to allow optimization of ACEi/ARB/ ARNi and MRA  as 
tolerated (see Section  6.7.2 ). The frequency of subject weekly visits during the Run -in 
Phase is at the discretion of the Investigator.  
Subjects with 2 Screening K+ values >5.0  mEq/L are considered hyperkalemic ; these 
patients begin patiromer (single -blind ed) when they qualify for the Run -in Phase (i.e., on 
the same day Run-in qualification is met or the next day).  
All other subjects are considered normokalemic  and serum K+ will be measured again latest 
at [ADDRESS_750515] progressed to hyperkalemia; 
in case of newly observed hypokalemia  during the first week of the Run-in Phase , patiromer 
must not be given.  

 
 
PAT -CR-302  
Protocol Version 4.0, 23 June 2021  Page 66 of 139 
 In subjects with hypokalemia serum K+ must be controlled after 3 days  to evaluate the 
effects of up -titrated ACEi/ARB/ARNi and/or MRA . Note : Depending on the actual local 
serum K+ value this could include patiromer 0  g/day (i.e ., 0 packet s/day)  during  the Run -in 
Phase . 
Except where noted, t he following activities will be performed during all visits during the 
Run-in Phase:

 9. STUDY ASSESSMENTS  
9.1 Potassium  
Serum  K+ levels will be assessed locally and /or by [CONTACT_571647] ( Schedule of Events ). Detailed instructions on how to draw 
blood and prepare specimens for analysis are provided in the Laboratory Manual.  
The definition of hyperkalemia follows the European Society of Cardiology expert 
consensus document on the management of hyperkalemia in pa tients with cardiovascular 
disease [36]. Hyperkalemia is considered for all serum K+ values >5.0 mEq/l with the 
gradings of mild hyperkalemia (serum K+ >5.0 mEq ≤5.5 mEq/l), moderate hyperkalemia 
(serum K+ >5.5 mEq ≤6.0 mEq/l) and severe hyperkalemia (serum K+ >6.0 mEq).  
9.1.1 Preventing, Identifying , and Handling Hemolyzed Samples  
Hemolysis of blood specimens may result in spuriously high K+ levels, potential ly leading 
to inappropriate up -titrating of patiromer/placebo or inappropriate down -titration or 
discontinuation of ACEi/ARB/ARNi or MRA in this study . 
The Laboratory Manual provides detailed descriptions of the recommended phlebotomy, 
sample preparation a nd transportation procedures to minimize hemolysis. Upon receipt of 
each blood sample for K+ analysis, the central laboratory will perform a semiquantitative 
test to assess for evidence of hemolysis. Predefined criteria will be established for 
determining whether the test result is indicative of potential hemolysis. These criteria and 
the criteria for removing serum K+ value s from analy ses on the basis of hemolysis are 
described in the Laboratory Manual. When a central laboratory sample has been identified 
as hemolyzed after it has been received and processed by [CONTACT_2237], the blood 
draw will not be repeated by [CONTACT_571648]. The Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) 
summarizes how the data analyses will account for the missing central laboratory K+ value. 
If a blood sample has been identified as hemolyzed by [CONTACT_14523] (i.e., visual 
inspection) before it has been sent to  the central laboratory, a repeat blood draw can be 
performed if the subject is still at the site.  
When a blood sample, which will be used by [CONTACT_571649]/placebo  titration and 
subject management, is hemolyzed (e.g., by [CONTACT_571650] l ocal laboratory serum 
sample), the site will repeat the K+ measurement from a separate blood draw within 1 day 
in order to ensure accurate decision -making regarding management of K+. 
9.1.2 Deviant Serum Potassium Levels During Screening Process  
At Screening , serum K+ is measured twice to assure correct identification of hyperkalemic 
and normokalemic subject s. Should the 2 serum K+ levels differ substantially with one 
value being ≤5.0 and the other >5.0  mEq/L, then a separate blood draw within [ADDRESS_750519] of Central Laboratory Assays

To qualify for the s tudy, subject must have eGFR ≥20 mL/min/1.73  m2 at Screening  from 
a single local laboratory analysis of serum creatinine and calculation using the CKD -EPI 
[INVESTIGATOR_144326] . If the local laboratory does not provide an eG FR value using the 
CKD -EPI [INVESTIGATOR_144326], the National Kidney Foundation online eGFR calculator  
(https://www.kidney.org/professionals/kdoqi/gfr_calculator ) may be used . 
For subjects who develop anuria during the study, urine assessments will not be required . 
9.2.[ADDRESS_750521], sitting quietly, for approximately 
5 minutes prior to the measurements.  
9.3.1 Heart Rate  
Heart rate is to be measured for a full 60 seconds  or as provided using the oscillometric 
blood pressure device.  
9.3.2 Blood Pressure  
Blood pressure will be performed using an  oscillometric device  after resting for 5 minutes . 
Blood pressure data for each visit should be recorded in the respective eCRF.  
9.4 Physical Examination  
Physical examination will be performed as indicated in the Schedule of Events . The 
following body systems are to be examined:  
• Cardiovascular  
• Lungs and chest, including respi[INVESTIGATOR_1520]  
• Head and neck  
• Abdomen  
• Musculoskeletal  
• Skin 
• Neurological  
Any new clinically significant physic al examination abnormality identified during the 
study will be reported as an AE.  
9.5 ECG Assessment  
If the Investigator is concerned regarding any K+ value, a retest of K+ level and/or ECG 
evaluation for electrophysiological manifestations can be initiated by [CONTACT_571651].  
The subject should be resting quietly for a minimum of 5 minutes prior to obtaining the 
ECG.  
If a K+-related ECG change is observ ed, the Investigator should apply the appropriate 
standard of care to stabilize the myocardium, which may include any or all of the following 

 
 
PAT -CR-[ADDRESS_750522]’s clinical situation: intravenous calcium gluconate, intravenous 
insulin and glucose, inh aled beta2 -agonists. In such cases, the ECG should be repeated 
within [ADDRESS_750523] should be 
assessed for referral to an emergency care facility.  
9.6 Urine Collection for ACR  
Urine samples will be col lected as indicated in the  Schedule of Events . The urine sample 
containers will be dispensed at the visit prior to the study visit where urine ACR is assessed  
and subjects will be provided with training and instructions on proper use of the u rine 
containers.  For the Run-in Phase Week 1 Visit assessment of urine ACR , the urine sample 
containers will be dispensed at the Screening Visit . For the Blinded Treatment Phase, at  the 
Day 3 Visit, the urine sample container  will be dispensed at the Day  1/Baseline Visit  (see 
Section  8). Note : Urine ACR is collected and measured at the Run -in Phase Week  [ADDRESS_750524] will be collecting the urine samples at home. Two urine samples will be 
collected: (1) the first morning void the day prior to , and (2) the first morn ing void the day 
of the study visit where urine samples will be collected from the subject . At an ET Visit, a 
single spot urine specimen may be collected at the clinic if time permits. Detailed 
description of the urine collection process for ACR measurements is provided in the 
Laboratory Manual.  
For subjects who develop anuria during the study, urine assessments will not be required.  
9.7 Patient -Reported Outcomes  
Patient -reported outcomes KCCQ  and 5Q-5L questionnaires will be completed by [CONTACT_571652]’ responses. The study coordinators will review the subject’s responses 
immediately after completion of the questionnaires by [CONTACT_571653].  The site will use the KCCQ and 5Q -5L questionnaire s to complete the 
corresponding modules in the electronic data capture ( EDC ) system . The original 
questionnaires must be retained as source documentation . 
KCCQ  
The KCCQ is a self-administered instrument that  is comp osed of 23 items, which quantifies 
the frequency, severity, and recent change in physical function and symptoms. Subjects 
will complete the KCCQ as indicated in the  Schedule of Events . 
EQ-5D-5L Questionnaire  
The EQ -5D-5L questionnaire  is comp osed of 5 questions each with 5 levels (e.g., no 
problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems,  and extreme problems) 
representing 5 health domains: mobility, self -care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and 
anxiety/depression. The EQ -5D-5L question naire also includes a visual analog scale that 

 
 
PAT -CR-[ADDRESS_750525]’s self -rated health status on a graduated scale that ranges from 0 –100, 
with higher scores indicating higher health -related quality of life.  Subjects will complete 
the EQ -5D-5L questionnair e as indicated in the  Schedule of Events . 
9.[ADDRESS_750526] is performed at 
Screening, Day  1/Baseline Visit, and EoS/ET Visit.  
Methods of birth control in sexually active subjects approved for use during this study 
include:  
• Hormonal birth control (oral, skin patch, or injection for at least [ADDRESS_750527] Screening Visit)  
• Removal of the uterus or tubal ligation  (already performed at least 6 months before 
screening)  
• Intrauterine device  (already performed at least 6 months before screening ) 
• Male partner who has had a vasectomy  
• Condom with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository  
Females of non -child -bearing potential must be postme nopausal with amenorrhea for 
12 consecutive months before the Screening Visit or serum follicle stimulating hormone 
levels consistent with postmenopausal status as per the Investigator’s  judgment.  
9.[ADDRESS_750528] be <[ADDRESS_750529] a causal relationship with 
this treatment  [36]. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable or unintended sign (including 
an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use 
of a medicinal (investigational)  product, whether or not related to the medicinal 
(investigational) product. This includes: (1) any new medical condition, sign or symptom, 
clinically significant physical examination abnormality or newly diagnosed event that 
occurs during the AE reporting  period (see Section 10.3), including signs or symptoms 
associated with an underlying condition that were not present prior to the AE reporting 
period; (2) a pre-existing  condition that has worsened in severity or frequency or changed 
in character after the subject signs the ICF during the AE reporting period; and (3) 
complications that occur as a result of protocol -mandated interventions. An AE can arise 
from any use of the investigational drug (e.g., off -label use, use in combination with another 
drug) and from any route of administration, formulation, or dose, including an overdose. It 
also includes any side effect s, injury, toxicity,  or sensitivity reactions that may be 
experienced by a subject in this clinical trial.  
For the purposes of this protocol, events that will not be considered AEs include : 
• Anticipated fluctuating signs or symptoms of a pre -existing medical condition (e.g., 
tremor in a subject with Parkinson’s disease; migraine epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]) that have not worsened 
in severity or frequency or changed in character during the AE reporting period  
• Surgeries or medical procedures are not AEs, however, the medical condition (new or 
worsened) that led to the surgery or medical procedure is the reported AE (e.g., for 
appendicitis resulting in appendectomy, appendicitis would be reported as the AE ) 
• Overdose  without clinical signs or symptoms  (see Section 10.8) 
• Pregnancy (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]  for reporting obligations)  
10.[ADDRESS_750530]’s source documents. The Invest igator must 
report any SAEs that occur after the protocol specified reporting period if according to the 

 
 
PAT -CR-302  
Protocol Version 4.0, 23 June 2021  Page 84 of 139 
 Investigator’s assessment there was a reasonable possibility that the SAE was related to 
patiromer /placebo  or any study procedures.  
10.[ADDRESS_750531] reports an AE, it is the Investigator’s responsibility to acquire sufficient 
information in order to assess causality. This may require additional laboratory testing, 
physical examinations, telephone contacts, etc.  
In order to  avoid bias in eliciting AEs, subjects should be asked a non -leading question, 
such as “How are you feeling?” It is also important to question the subject in a non -leading 
way about changes in their health or concomitant medication usage since their last v isit. 
This information should be collected prior to completion of assessments at all study visits. 
In addition, any symptoms/conditions reported during assessments and deemed to be 
clinically significant by [CONTACT_571654].  
10.4 Assessi ng Adverse Events  
10.4.1  Intensity/Severity  
The medical assessment of intensity will be determined by [INVESTIGATOR_1477]:  
• Mild:  The AE is easily tolerated and does not interfere with usual activity  
• Moderate:  The AE interferes with daily activity, but  the subject is still able to function  
• Severe : The AE is incapacitating,  and the subject is unable to work or complete usual 
activity  
A new event will be documented each time the intensity of an event has changed.  
It is important to note the distinctions between severe AEs and serious AEs (SAEs). 
Severity is a classification of intensity of a specific event (as in mild, moderate, or severe); 
however, the event itself may be of relatively minor medical significance (such as severe 
headache). An  SAE, however, is an AE that meets any of the regulatory specified criteria 
required for designation as seriousness described in Section  10.7.1  (i.e., a headache may be 
severe (interferes significantly with subject's usual function ) but would not be classified as 
serious unless it met one of the criteria for SAEs).  
10.4.2  Causality and Reporting  
The Investigator will provide a causality assessment for all A Es using his/her best clinical 
judgment based upon the available medical information of the event that is being reported. 
The causality assessment will be re -assessed as new medical information becomes available. 
If the Investigator’s causality assessment is not reported it will be considered as “related” 
until it is received. The Investigator will each assess relatedness of the AE to the 
investigational drugs, patiromer/placebo, using the following definitions:  

 
 
PAT -CR-302  
Protocol Version 4.0, 23 June 2021  Page 85 of 139 
 Not Related:  There is no reasonable possibility that patiromer caused or contributed to the 
AE. 
• The event is related to an etiology other than the investigational drug such as underlying 
disease, study or non -study procedures, concomitant medications, or the subject’s  
clinical state  
• The time of the occurrence of the AE is not reasonably related to the administration of 
the study drug  
Related:  There is a reasonable possibility that patiromer caused or contributed to the AE.  
• There is a compatible temporal association between the event and the administration of 
investigational drug  
• There is a biologically plausible mechanism for the study treatme nt to cause or 
contribute to the AE  
• The event improves or diminishes upon withdrawal of the study drug without the 
initiation of any specific treatments for the event ( dechallenge), and/or the event recurs 
or worsens with the rechallenge of the study thera py 
• The event cannot be reasonably attributed to concurrent or underlying illness, other 
drugs,  or procedures  
For causality assessment purposes “reasonable possibility” is meant to convey that, based 
on the Investigator’s medical judgment of the available i nformation, there are facts or 
arguments to suggest a positive causal relationship.  
10.4.3  Outcome Categori zation  
Outcome is classified as: recovered/resolved (i.e., without sequelae); recovered/resolved 
with sequelae; not recovered/not resolved; fatal; or unknown (if follow -up is not possible).  
If the outcome of an SAE is reported as recovered/resolved with sequelae, the Inves tigator 
specif ies the kind of sequelae on the SAE form. If the outcome of an SAE is reported as 
unknown, the Investigator specif ies (on the SAE form) the rationale why unknown was 
selected . 
“Fatal” is to be recorded as an outcome when the AE results in dea th. Cause of death is 
required whenever known. If an autopsy was performed, an autopsy report will be provided. 
If an autopsy was not conducted, a Death Certificate will be provided if obtainable. Death 
will be reported as an outcome and not as an event. If more than one AE is possibly related 
to the subject's death, the outcome of death will be indicated for the AE that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_18959], is the most plausible cause of death. All other ongoing AE/SAEs will 
be recorded as not recovered/not  resolved at the time of death.  

 
 
PAT -CR-[ADDRESS_750532] each recurrence recorded separately in 
the eCRF.  
10.5.2  Diagnosis Versus Signs and Symptoms  
Where  possible, the Investigator report s a diagnosis rather than individual signs and 
symptoms or abnormal laboratory values. However, if a constellation of signs and/or 
symptoms cannot be medically characteri zed as a single diagnosis or syndrome at the time 
of reporting, each individual event should be recorded in the eCRF. If a diagnosis is 
subsequently established, all previously reported AEs based on signs and symptoms should 
be nullified and replaced by [ADDRESS_750533] medical terminology/concepts; avoid colloquialisms 
and abbreviations. Only 1 AE term should be recorded in each event field  in the eCRF.  
10.5.3  Pre-existing Medical Conditions  
A pre -existing medical condition is one that is present at the Screening Visit for this study. 
Such conditions should be recorded on the medical history eCRF. A pre -existing medical 
condition should be recorded as an AE only if the frequency, severity, or character of the 
condition worsens during the study. When recording such events on the AE eCRF, it is 
important to convey the concept that the pre -existing condition has changed by [CONTACT_188215] (e.g., “more frequent headaches”).  
10.5.[ADDRESS_750534] be reported as an AE if it meets any of the following criteria:  
• Is accompanied by [CONTACT_4659]  
• Results in a change in study treatment (e.g., dosage modification, treatment interruption, 
or treatment discontinuation) . For the purpose of this study , AEs should be reported if 
K+ <4.0 mEq/L or >5.0 mEq/L  
• Results in a medical intervention (e.g., K+ supplementation for hypokalemia) or a 
change in concomitant therapy  

 
 
PAT -CR-302  
Protocol Version 4.0, 23 June 2021  Page 87 of 139 
 • Presents shift of a parameter from a normal value to a pathological value  or a further 
worsening of an already pathological value  
• Is clinically significant in the Investigator’s judgment  
It is the Investigator’s responsibility to review all laboratory findings. Medical and 
scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated laboratory 
abnormality should be classified as an AE. When evaluating such changes, the extent of 
deviation from the reference range, the duration until return to the reference range, either 
while continuing treatment or after the end of treatment with the investigatio nal product, 
and the range of variation of the respective parameter within its reference range, must be 
taken into consideration.  
The Investigator has the responsibility to determine the clinical significance of each 
abnormality . 
If, at the end of the Treatment Phase, there are pathological laboratory values which were 
not present at Baseline , further clinical or laboratory investigations should be performed 
until the values return to within reference range or until a plausible exp lanation 
(e.g.,  concomitant disease) is found for the pathological laboratory values.  
The Investigator should decide, based on the above criteria and the clinical condition of a 
subject, whether a change in a laboratory parameter is clinically significant and therefore 
represents an AE. If the Investigator considers such an AE as serious (e.g.,  medically 
significant event fulfilling criteria per Section 10.7.1 ), it must be reported as an SAE.  
If a laboratory abnormality meeting the above criteria is a sign of a disease or syndrome 
only the diagnosis should be recorded in the eCRF.  
If a laboratory abnormality meeting the above criteria is not a sign of  a disease or syndrome, 
the abnormality itself should be recorded in the eCRF, along with a descriptor indicating if 
the test result is above or below the normal range (e.g., “elevated K+,” as opposed to 
“abnormal K+”). 
If the laboratory abnormality can be characteri zed by a precise clinical term per standard 
definitions, the clinical term should be recorded as the AE , for example, hypercalcemia or 
hypoglycemia. Observations of the same laboratory abnormality from visit to visit should 
not be repeatedly recorded in the eCRF unless  the etiology changes. The initial severity of 
the event should be recorded, and the severity or seriousness should be updated any time 
the event worsens.  
All pathological laboratory findings/values diagnosed throu ghout the treatment period 
should be reviewed by [CONTACT_501217] a final clinical assessment in view of the 
dynamic of laboratory changes/abnormalities.  

 
 
PAT -CR-[ADDRESS_750535] one of the following criteria:  
• Associated with symptoms or lead to a diagnosis (in such case the symptom or diagnosis 
will be recorded as an AE)  
• Lead to discontinuation of pati romer /placebo  
• Required treatment or subject referral for further testing outside the protocol (repeat 
testing or titration are within protocol procedures)  
It is the Investigator’s responsibility to review all vital sign, ECG, and other safety findings. 
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated 
abnormality should be classified as an AE.  
If a clinically significant abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome (e.g.,  high blood 
pressure), only the diagnosis (i.e., hypertension) should be recorded in the eCRF.  
Observations of the same clinically significant abnormality from visit to visit should not be 
repeatedly recorded in the eCRF unless  the etiology changes. The initial severity of the 
event should be reco rded, and the severity or seriousness should be updated any time the 
event worsen s. 
10.6 Adverse Drug Reaction  and Reference Safety Information  
10.6.1  Adverse Drug Reaction  
An adverse drug reaction  (ADR) is an untoward and unintended response to an IMP related 
to any dose administered. This definition implies a reasonable possibility of a causal 
relationship between the event and the IMP. This means that there are facts (evidence) or 
arguments to suggest a  causal relationship.  
All AEs judged as having a reasonable causal relationship to a medicinal (investigational) 
product will be designated as ADRs . 
10.6.2  Reference Safety Information  
The Reference Safety Information (RSI) presents the basis for expectedness ass essment of 
an ADR  for expedite d reporting and annual safety reporting, as well as surveillance of 
subject’s safety in a clinical trial by [CONTACT_30962] (and ethic) bodies.  
In the context of this study, the RSI for patiromer is integrated in Table [ADDRESS_750536] medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening (the term life -threatening in the definition of serious refers to an event 
in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an 
event which hypothetically might have caused death if it was more severe)  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_18973]. 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_63805], i.e., a planned, non -emergency medical procedure, 
social hospi[INVESTIGATOR_571575] 24 hours are not considered 
SAEs  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• Is an importan t medical event (i.e., medically significant)  
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited 
reporting is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not 
be immediately life -threatening or r esult in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_571576]. These events should also be considered as serious.  
Any worsening of a pre -existing medical con dition or any new medical condition that meets 
the above SAE criteria should be considered as an SAE.  
The Investigator is encouraged to discuss with the CRO or Sponsor any AEs for which the 
issue of seriousness is unclear or questionable.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Situations That Are Not Considered S AEs 
The following situations are not considered as SAEs:  
• Elective or pre -planned surgery for a pre -existing condition that has not worsened  
• Routine health assessments requiring admission not associated with any deterioration 
in condition  
• Social admission (lack of housing, family circumstances, etc.)  

 
 
PAT -CR-[ADDRESS_750537] be immediately reported to the Sponsor (or its delegate,  
e.g., CRO) within 24 hours of awareness by [CONTACT_6972], email,  or telephone/via EDC  system . 
This includes all SAEs (independent of relationship to study treatment ). 
A death occurring during the study or which comes to the attention of the Investigator 
within [ADDRESS_750538] be reporte d to the 
CRO/ Sponsor . 
Any SAE considered to have a causal relationship (i.e., related) to the investigational 
product and discovered by [CONTACT_7201]. 
A rationale for the assessment of a causal relationship  must be provided by [CONTACT_737]. 
Any safety information that is obtained after database lock of the clinical database will be 
documented in the safety database and implications for handling the data in the clinical 
database assessed on an individual case basis.  
The onset date of the SAE is defined as the date the signs and symptoms/diagnosis became 
serious (i.e., met at least one of the criteria for seriousness; see Section 10.7.1 ). If the subject 
experiences an AE and it progresses into a n SAE, a new SAE should be recorded. The 
original AE stop date should be the same as the start date of the SAE. However , when the 
SAE resolves and the pre -existing AE is still ongoing, this should be recorded as a new AE . 
The resolution date of an SAE is defined as when th e symptoms resolve, or the event is 
considered chronic (e.g., sequelae) or stable, and/or if the seriousness criteria are no longer 
applicable.  
The Investigator must complete the SAE report form  and verify the accuracy of the 
information recorded on the SA E pages with the source documents. The Sponsor SAE 
report form will be completed in capi[INVESTIGATOR_1791], in medical terms, in English and to the best 
extent possible given the time constraints. Any supporting documentation (e.g.,  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_145371], autopsy report/death certificate, etc.) should be sent/transmitted alo ng 
with the (follow -up) SAE report form. The supporting information provided should not 
reveal a subject’s identity beyond the agreed study identifier. The Investigator should 
ensure that the information reported is accurate and consistent.  
At a minimum,  the following should be provided at the time of the initial SAE report:  
• Study name [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or number  

 
 
PAT -CR-302  
Protocol Version 4.0, 23 June 2021  Page 91 of 139 
 • Subject number, age, and gender/sex  
• Event description/verbatim (including onset date of the SAE, outcome,  and reason for 
it being considered serious)  
• Relationsh ip to patiromer/placebo  (i.e., causality)  
• Patiromer/placebo  dose (number of packets) and administration dates  
• Action taken with patiromer/placebo  
• Severity of the event  
• Investigator name [CONTACT_3816]  
• Name [CONTACT_225982] (including site name [CONTACT_571683]), and,  
• Dated signature [CONTACT_571684] -/Co-Investigator  
When using electronic methods of reporting SAEs, some of the information in the above 
list may be generated by [CONTACT_127201].  
Since SAEs are also AEs, the information for the AE eCRF and SAE form should be 
consistent.  
Follow -up information must be handled in the same way and reported within the same time 
frame as the initial SAE report.  A safety contact [CONTACT_571655] (prior to first subject providing informed consent) detailing all applicable 
contact [CONTACT_571656]. This contact [CONTACT_571657] y. 
Where possible, the Investigator should report a diagnosis rather than signs and symptoms.  
Death should be considered an outcome and not a distinct event. In case of a fatal outcome, 
the Investigator should provide a working diagnosis (event which caused outcome, e.g., 
death due to fatal myocardial infarction ) instead of reporting only death; an d an autopsy 
report should be provided where possible. If the cause of death later becomes available (e.g., 
after autopsy), this working diagnosis should be replaced by [CONTACT_25749].  
All recorded SAEs, regardless of relationship to invest igational product, will be followed 
up until resolution, stabili zation, or the subject is lost to follow -up and cannot be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530]. 
After the completion of the 2 weeks follow -up after the EoS , updates should be submitted 
to the Sponsor (or its delegate, CRO) using the Sponsor SAE report form. In circumstances 
where the Investigator is unable to make contact [CONTACT_1155] (or his/her relatives), the

[IP_ADDRESS]  Study Endpoints  
All events  potentially related to the endpoint  of CV death or CV hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] s or urgent 
HF visits  will be collected starting from the date of randomization . For the purposes of this 
protocol, t he following events are considered SAEs and must  be reported as described in 
Section  10.7.2 . 
• Death from any  cause  
• Any CV event leading to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (e.g., HF, myocardial infarction , stroke, 
unstable angina, arrhythmia)  
The following CV hospi[INVESTIGATOR_571577] : 
• HF hospi[INVESTIGATOR_571578] (e.g., emergency room or outpatient 
visit for worsening HF during which the subject  received intravenous medications for 
the treatment of HF)  
• Type I acute myocardial in farction (including both ST segment elevation myocardial 
infarction and non -ST segment elevation myocardial infarction) leading to 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
• All types of arrhythmia including atrial fibrillation requiring leading to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
• Hypertension emergency; systolic blood pressure ≥180 mmHg leading to 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
• Stroke leading to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_571579], events suggestive of th e study outcomes would automatically 
qualify to meet the criteria of seriousness in this study. These events include known 
consequences of the underlying disease and are anticipated to occur in the study population 
independent of drug exposure (see above b ullet points). These events would be reported, 
collected and monitored during the course of the study like all other SAE s, but would not 
be reported individually in an expedited manner , unless the Investigator and/or Sponsor has

10.7.1 ) and unexpected (per the RSI; see Secti on 10.6.2 ) that is felt to have a reasonable 
suspected causal relationship to a medicinal product.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  S[LOCATION_003]R  Reporting  
The Investigator is responsible for notifying the IRB in accordance with local regulations 
of all S[LOCATION_003]Rs  that occur. The Investigator must review and file the associated safety report 
with the IB. 
10.8 Special Situations  
10.8.1  Definition of Special Situations  
The fol lowing are defined as special situations:  
• Use of an IMP during pregnancy or breastfeeding  
• Medication abuse: the persistent or sporadic, intentional excessive use of study 
medication  by [CONTACT_423] (not for therapeutic purpose)  
• Medication error: any unintentional error in the prescribing, dispensing or 
administration of an IMP during the study . (Medication errors are any preventable event 
that may cause or lead to inappropriate medica tion use or patient harm while the 
medication is in the control of the health care professional or subject ) 
• Medication misuse: an intentional and inappropriate use of an IMP by [CONTACT_256856] a 
therapeutic purpose not in accordance with the protocol dose,  route of administration, 
and/or the indication(s)  (e.g.: Subject deliberately took the medication twice daily 
instead of once daily)  
• Medication overdose: the administration of a quantity of study medication given per 
administration or per day which is 3 times  above the protocol maximum permitted dose  
• Drug interaction involving study medication  
• Unexpected therapeutic or clinical benefit from study medication  use 

 
 
PAT -CR-302  
Protocol Version 4.0, 23 June 2021  Page 94 of 139 
 Suspected AEs associated with medication errors of the IMP or use outside that foreseen 
in the protocol (e.g., overdose) are also considered as ADRs. Any special situation 
occurring with/without ADR/AE shall be recorded in the study -specific documentation  by 
[CONTACT_24342].  
10.8.[ADDRESS_750541]’s eCRF and source documents.  
If any special situation leads to an SAE (see Section 10.7.1 ), then the event has to be 
immediately reported to the Sponsor (or its delegate; e.g., CRO) within 24 hours of 
awareness by [CONTACT_6972], email or telephone/via EDC  system . 
Medication error due to product dose omission (subject forgetting to take a dose), does not 
need to be documented in the eCRF if the product dose omission did not occur 
consecutively, and compliance is not <80%.  
10.8.3  Pregnancy Exposure and Birth Events  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Definition of Pregnancy Expos ure and Birth Events  
When a female subject becomes pregnant during the study and study treatment has been 
administered to the subject, the outcome of the pregnancy needs to be monitored and the 
safety of the mother and unborn child need to be safeguarded (as per protocol, pregnancy 
is an exclusion criteria). Therefore, the outcome of all such pregnancies (including normal 
births) must be followed up and documented, even if the subject was withdrawn from the 
study or the study has been completed . 
Women of child -bearing potential, defined as a premenopausal female capable of becoming 
pregnant, should have a negative pregnancy test prior to randomi zation. Study medication 
must not be initiated by [CONTACT_368697] a report of a negative pregna ncy test has been 
obtained.  
Effective birth control must be used (in female subjects) before beginning study medication, 
during study dosing, and for 4 weeks  following discontinuation of study medication ; see 
Section 9.8. 
A female subject must immediately inform the Investigator if she becomes pregnant during 
the study , and she will be instructed by [CONTACT_571658]. 
The Medical Monitor must be contact[CONTACT_15608]. The Investigator should counsel the 
subject and discuss the risks of continuing with the pregnancy and the possible effects on 
the fetus.  
The Investigator is responsible for monitoring the subj ect and pregnancy outcome  and 
reporting this information to the Sponsor . Every effort should be made to gather 
information regarding the pregnancy outcome until 90 days postpartum (or otherwise as 
appropriate).

 [IP_ADDRESS]  Pregnancy Exposure and Birth Events Recording and Reporting  
If a female subject become s pregnant or is suspected of being pregnant while participating 
in this study, the investigational product will be permanently discontinued, and the event 
must be reported to Drug Safety upon receipt of in formation by [CONTACT_5984]. Pregnancies 
must be reported throughout the conduct of the study including [ADDRESS_750542] be reported to Drug 
Safety within 24 hours of becoming aware on the Sponsor  Report on Exposure to Medicines 
During Pregnancy Form. Pregnancy complications are reported as AEs or SAEs (if 
applicable). Any pregnancy will be followed through delivery for the observation of any 
SAEs. Fatalities, elective or spontaneous abortions, congenital abnormalities/birth defects 
and AEs/SAEs occ urring in the newborn must be reported as SAEs. Newborns potentially 
exposed to study drug via maternal or paternal sources who experience a n SAE before, 
during, or after delivery (including lactation by [CONTACT_571659]) will be followed until 
resolut ion of the event (or for a minimum of 1 year).

safety of subjects who participate in this study. The DSMB is governed by a charter which 
explains the working procedures and responsibilities of the DSMB  [38]. 
11.2 Event Adjudication Committee  
The independent Event Adjudication Committee (EAC) will adjudicate all events relating 
to the study endpoints based on prospectively defined criteria detailed in  the EAC charter. 
EAC members must not be employees of the study Sponsor  and consists of, at minimum, 
3 qualified members (at least one cardiologist specializing in HF) ; see EAC charter for 
further details  [39]. The EAC will be blinded to study treatment allocations while 
adjudicating the events. Endpoint adjudication will occur on an ongoing basis throughout 
the Blinded Treatm ent Phase of the study.

 12. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
12.1 Statistical Methods  
Detailed methodology for summary and statistical analyses of the data collected in this trial 
will be documented in a n SAP. A general description of the planned methods is provided 
below. Any deviation from the SAP will be noted and explained in the final study report.  
12.2 Sample Size and Power Calculations  
The sample size of 410 subjects per treatment arm (total of 820 subjects) has been 
calculated to provide 90% power to detect a difference between the control group (placebo) 
and the active group (patiromer) on  the mean change in K+ levels from Baseline. This 
sample size calculation was based upon the following assumptions : alpha level of 5% 
(2-sided), a difference between group means of 0.116 , an SD of 0.5,  and a 5% annual rate 
of loss to follow -up. 
12.3 Randomization  
Subjects will be randomized to the treatment arms (1:1 assi gnment) using permuted block 
randomization  stratified by [CONTACT_1617] . Randomization will take place using a 
centralized list accessed electronically via IWRS on the day of randomization , after 
randomization eligibility is determined.  
12.[ADDRESS_750545] of all subjects who satisfy the following criteria:  
• Randomized to treatment  
• Received at least 1 dose of randomized treatment  
This set will be used for the evaluation of efficacy.  
12.4.3  Safety Set  
The safety set (SS) consists of all subjects who have taken at least [ADDRESS_750546] and summari zed by [CONTACT_1570] . 
12.7 Concomitant Therapy  
Concomitant medications (as defined in Section 6.8.4 ) will be categori zed according to a 
standard dictionary (World Health Organization Drug Dictionary ). Counts and percentages 
of subject use for each medication will be computed and summari zed by [CONTACT_1570]. 
Summaries will be provided for the periods bef ore and after randomized treatment was 
received.  
12.8 Efficacy Evaluations  
12.8.1  Primary  
The primary analysis will be based upon the mean change  in serum K+ levels from Baseline 
and is analyzed by [CONTACT_3553] a n MMRM approach including all available post Baseline  data. 
All analyses will be restricted to serum K+ assessments  and not substituted by [CONTACT_571660]. Central lab oratory  values and /or local 
laboratory  will be used at all vis its, and if both values are present at one visit, then central 
laboratory  values will be used. A Gaussian linear model for repeated measures with 
treatment, geographic region, sex, baseline T2DM status, and visit as factors, and baseline 
K+ level, baseline eGFR as covariate s. The error terms are assumed to follow a multivariate 
normal distribution w ith unstructured covariance. Least squares mean changes from 
Baseline will be reported for both treatment groups with 95% CI s as well as the difference 
between the least squares group means with 95% CI and p -value testing the null hypothesis 
of no treatmen t effect.  

 
 
PAT -CR-302  
Protocol Version 4.0, 23 June 2021  Page 99 of 139 
 Sensitivity analyses for the primary endpoint will be based upon the use of all CV deaths 
and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602] (i.e., recurrent event analysis) recorded during follow -up using the 
following methods: will explore changes in treatment effect over follow -up time by 
[CONTACT_571661] -mentioned model. In addition, 
sensitivity analyses for the primary endpoint will explore changes in treatment effect over 
follow -up time by [CONTACT_571603] -mentioned model. 
In addition, sensitivity analyses accounting for potentially informative missingness will be 
based upon a Win  Ratio appr oach [4,40].  
12.8.2  Key Secondary  Endpoints  (Hierarchically Ordered)  
Secondary efficacy endpoints will be tested sequentially in the order listed below 
(i.e., fixed -sequence method to preserve the family -wise error rate) and summarized 
descriptively through the calculation of point estimates by [CONTACT_73332] 95% 
CIs for the treatment differences. The following lists the secondary endpoints and the 
analysis method to be used:  
• Hyperkalemia events : The time to the first event of hyperkalemia with a serum K+ 
value >5.5 mEq/L  as per the measured values from the central or local laboratories  is 
analyzed  using a Cox proportional hazards regression model.  The event probabilities 
will be estimated using the Aalen -Johansen estimator of the cumulative incidence 
function accounting f or competing events such as  death . 
• Durable enablement to stay on the MRA target dose  (of 50  mg spi[INVESTIGATOR_571545]) : The time to the even t of reduction of the MRA dose below target  is 
analyzed  using a Cox proportional hazards regression model. The  event probabilities 
will be estimated using Aalen -Johansen estimator of the cumulative incidence function 
accounting for competing events such as  death . 
Note: Discontinuation of the target dose for at least 14  days (or less if at the EoS) is 
required to confirm this endpoint .  
• Investigator reported AEs of hyperkalemia (first  and recurrent ) are analy zed using a 
negative binomial regression with the logarithm of the individual follow -up time as 
offset . A joint fr ailty model of the total (first and recurrent) hyperkalemia events and 
time to death as terminating event. If all-cause mortality is substantial in number and 
differential between the treatment groups, then the joint frailty model would become 
the main  analysis approach . Note: For analyses based upon the negative binomial 
distribution, the subject level count data will be modeled as function of treatment with 
the natural log of the subject level follow -up time taken into account in the estimation 
of the eve nt rate.

Protocol Version 4.0, 23 June 2021  Page 100 of 139 
 • Hyperkalemia -related h ard outcomes  are analyzed using the Win Ratio approach with 
the following hierarchical components (all assessed during comparable follow -up 
times):

5. Total number of hyperkalemia toxicity events with serum K+ >5.0 -6.0 mEq/L  
• RAASi Use Score which will be analyzed  using the Win Ratio approach for each pair 
of patients at the end of the comparable follow -up period that is appropriate for that pair 
of patients with the following additive components. Points are accumulated from two 
components at the respective time fo r each patient in each comparison:  
Component A:  
− If during the follow -up (to the respective end of follow -up in the comparison) there 
was a death, th e subject  is assigned  0 points  
− If during the follow -up (to the respective end of follow -up in the comparison) there 
was a CV hospi[INVESTIGATOR_18543], but the subject  is alive at the end of that follow -up, the 
subject  is assigned  1 point  
− If during the follow -up (to the respective end of follow -up in the comparison) there 
was no CV hospi[INVESTIGATOR_571580] t is alive at the end of that follow -up, the 
subject  is assigned  2 points  
Component B:  
Further points are collected for the treatment status at the respective end of follow -up 
in the comparison : 
− For ACEi/ARB/ARNi use: >50% of the target dose = 2 points  
− For ACEi/ARB/ARNi use: >0 and up to 50% of the target dose = 1 point  
− For MRA use: >50% of the target dose = 2 points  
− For MRA use: >0 and up to 50% of the target dose = 1 point  
− For beta-blocker  use: >50% of the target dose = 2 points

seriousness, and Investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_571581] /placebo . 
The Investigator is required to prepare and maintain adequate and accurate case histories 
that record all observations and other data pertinent to the investigation for all subjects.  
Source documentation shou ld be available at monitoring visits to verify entries made on 
eCRFs, as needed. Source documentation should also be available for verification by 
[CONTACT_236852]/or inspectors, as needed.

records should include detailed notes on:  
• The medical history  prior to participation in the study  
• The basic identifying information, such as demographics, that link the subject’s source 
documents with the eCRFs  
• The results of all diagnostic tests performed, diagnoses made, therapy provided , and 
any other data on the condition of the subject  
• The subject’s exposure to study treatment  
• All AEs  and pregnancies  
• All special situations as defined in Section 10.8 
• The subject’s exposure to any conco mitant therapy  
• All relevant observations and data on the condition of the subject throughout the study  
• The oral and written communication with the subject regarding the study treatment 
(including the risks and benefits of the study) ; the date of informed consent must be 
recorded in the source documentation

15.2 Case Report Forms/Electronic Data Record  
An eCRF is designed to record all of the protocol  required information to be reported t o the 
Sponsor  on each trial subject. The Investigator is responsible for ensuring the accuracy, 
completeness, legibility, and timeliness of the data reported on subjects’ eCRFs. Data 
reported on the eCRF, which are derived from source documents, should be consistent with 
the source documents or the discrepancies should be explained. An explanation should be 
given for all missing data.  
All eCRF data and query resolutions must be completed only by [CONTACT_571665]. Site staff will have proper training prior to accessing the 
EDC system.  
Any change or correction to an eCRF will be tracked via an audit trail within the EDC 
system. The audit trail will contain the original data value, new data value, date changed, 
the use r who made the change, and the reason(s) for the change.  
eCRFs should be completed in a timely manner  to the respective visit  (i.e., the site should 
not wait for a monitoring visit before entering data into the eCRF).  
Data from the eCRFs and queries will b e tracked and entered into a [ADDRESS_750556] dictionaries (e.g., MedDRA and World Health Organization Drug 
Dictionary).  
The Investigator is responsible for reviewing, verifying, and approving all subject data (i.e., 
eCRFs and resolved queries).  
15.[ADDRESS_750557] maintain adequate records for the study including completed eCRFs, 
medical records, laboratory reports, signed ICFs, drug disposition records, adverse 
experience reports, information regarding subjects who discontinued, all correspondence 
with the IRB/IEC and the Sponsor , and other pertinent data.  
The Investigator is to retain all records until notified by [CONTACT_1034] . The Investigator will 
notify the Sponsor  in writing of the relocation of any study records away from the res earch 
facility after study closure. The Investigator must contact [CONTACT_571666], or in the event of loss of any study records.  

 
 
PAT -CR-[ADDRESS_750558] be implemented as an amendment to the protocol  (see Section 16.2). The 
criteria describing protocol deviation(s) and how they will be handled will be documented 
in the Study Manual . 
16.[ADDRESS_750559] be made only with the prior approval of the Sponsor . Each applicable Regulatory 
Authority/IRB/EC/IEC will review and approve amendments prior to their implementa tion. 
Regulatory Authority/IRB/EC/IEC approval need not be obtained prior to removal of an 
immediate hazard to subjects.  
16.3 Study Termination  
The Sponsor  reserves the right to terminate the study in its entirety or at a site at any time.  
Reasons for terminati on may include (but are not limited to) unsatisfactory subject 
enrol lment with respect to quality and/or quantity, site is unable to comply with the 
requirements of the protocol or GCP, or data recording is inaccurate and/or incomplete.  
In terminating the study, the Sponsor  and the Investigator will assure that adequate 
consideration is given to the protection of the subject’s interests.  Both parties will arrange 
the procedures on an individual basis after review and consultation and in accordance with 
the study contract.  
Based on their data review, the DSMB  may provide recommendations to stop the study as 
per guidance within the DSMB  Charter. The Sponsor  will determine whether the study 
should be stopped early.  
The study may be terminated or suspended upon request of regulatory authorities.

Section 12.8.1   Statistical Methods:  
The primary analysis will be based upon the time to the first 
occurrence of the primary endpoint consisting of a CV death or 
CV hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (or equivalent in outpatient clinic). The test 
of significance will be based upon a stratified (randomization 
strata) log -rank test. The treatment effect will be summarized 
using the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) 
calculated using a stratified (randomization strata) Cox 
regress ion model with treatment as the model parameter. In 
these analyses, subjects will be censored as of their last 
assessment for the primary endpoint as well as for deaths for 
non-CV causes. Sensitivity analyses for the primary endpoint 
will be based upon the  use of all CV deaths and 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602] (i.e., recurrent event analysis) recorded during 
follow -up using the following methods:  
• Extended Cox model [2]  
• Days alive outside of the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] [3]  
• Rank based analysis [4]  
Additional descriptive statistics  will be calculated to better 
understand the recurrent events pattern. In particular, the HR 
will be estimated within event count using a conditional model 
(gap-time method) that allows both the underlying hazard and 
HR to vary (Prentice, Williams and Pete rson, 1981) with a 
robust variance estimator. In this approach, subjects Statistical Methods:  
The mean change in serum K+ levels from Baseline 
is analyzed by [CONTACT_3553] a mixed model for 
repeated measures (MMRM) approach including 
all available follow -up data. A Gaussian linear 
model for repeated measures with treatment, 
geographic region, sex, basel ine Type 2 diabetes 
mellitus ( T2DM ) status  and visit as factors, and 
baseline K+ level, baseline eGFR as covariates. The 
error terms are assumed to follow a multivariate 
normal distribution with unstructured covariance.  
Sensitivity analyses for the primary endpoint will 
explore changes in treatment effect over follow -up 
time by [CONTACT_571672] -mentioned model. In addition, 
sensitivity analyses accounting for potentially 
informative m issingness will be based upon a Win 
Ratio approach.  
Secondary efficacy endpoints will be tested in the 
order listed (i.e., fixed -sequence method to preserve 
the family -wise error rate) and summarized

receive summaries of study conduct measures as well as 
unblinded safety and efficacy data.  
To protect the study from prematurely being clo sed for a 
finding of efficacy, the DSMB will be requested to use the 
O’Brien -Fleming (Lan -DeMets implementation) for evaluating 
the primary efficacy endpoint in a formal interim analysis of 
efficacy. A single such evaluation is planned when 50% of the 
planned primary endpoint events are positively adjudicated.  
The final analysis will take into account the interim analysis. 
As such, the significance level at the final analysis will be 
adjusted, following Lan -DeMets, to take into account the exact 
timing of t he interim analysis.

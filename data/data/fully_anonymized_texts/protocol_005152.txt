Protocol Title 
WYZ: A Mobile Health Application for Engagement in Care Among Youth Living With HIV  
Background  
Globally, youth and young adults are recognized  as being particularly vulnerable to HIV and 
bear a disproportionate share of the HIV burden, with HIV being the second leading cause of 
death.1 In the [LOCATION_003], youth and young adults living with HIV (YLWH) have the lowest likelihood of 
linking to care, being retained in care, adhering to antiretroviral therapy (ART) and achieving 
viral suppression, compared with other age groups.2–4 One review estimated that among all 
YLWH in the [LOCATION_003], fewer than 6% are virally suppressed.[ADDRESS_677790] shown that YLWH face many challenges across the 
HIV care continuum, and clinical outcomes are worse in this group compared with adults.7 The 
combination of these health disparities and developmental challenges in this transitional period 
may further hinder YLWH’s ability to maintain optimal ART adherence and sustain virological 
suppression.1 7 The link between younger age and lower ART adherence and higher risk of 
virological failure has been reported in numerous studies.8–11 However, there are few studies to 
inform the design of youth- friendly healthcare services and interventions.12 
 
The widespread use of personal mobile phones presents an opportunity to develop novel 
interventions capable of bridging structural and systemic gaps in service and improving the 
equity of healthcare delivery. Mobile health (mHealth), the use of mobile technology for health, 
has the potential to reduce barriers to healthcare access, increase use of healthcare services 
and improve health outcomes among underserved populations.[ADDRESS_677791] potential to  benefit from such technology -based interventions.15 In the [LOCATION_003], 
among 18 –29 year -olds, greater than 77% download mobile applications and over 90% are 
users of social media.[ADDRESS_677792] it among 18 –29 year -olds living with HIV.  
Objectives  
WYZ is an mHealth intervention designed and developed in collaboration with YLWH to 
improve ART adherence and engagement in HIV care among this age group.  WYZ contains three 
main features, My Health, My Team, and  My Community. My Health allows users to keep track 
of their  ART medication information, visualize their adherence and  laboratory data, and 
understand their health; My Team provides  community resources and facilitates 
communication with health  care team members; and My Community allows for social support 
from peers through anonymous and moderated discussion forums and allows users to stay up -
to-date on health -related news. These features were developed with guidance from youth and 
young adults living with HIV and  further refined through focus groups with youth and young  
adults living with HIV and iterative field testing with our Youth Advisory Panel (YAP), and were 
chosen to address specific  barriers to ART adherence and engagement in HIV care ( e.g., 
social isolation and lack of community support).  
 
We will conduct a 6 -month single -arm pi[INVESTIGATOR_522551] (18 –29 years old) who live or receive care in the San Francisco Bay Area. The 
objective of this forthcoming phase is to refine the design and development and pi[INVESTIGATOR_522552]. 
All study activities, including recruitment, screening, enrolment, study assessments, provision 
of incentives and exit interviews, will be conducted remotely.  
Sample Size and Eligibility  
We will enroll up to [ADDRESS_677793] a subset of 25 participants to take part in a 30 minute qualitative interview about  
their experience with the app.  
 
Inclusion  Criteria:  
1. All YLWH will be confirmed HIV -positive, age [ADDRESS_677794] a smartphone (iOS V10.0 and above or Android V5.0 and above), and  be able to 
understand the consent procedure and voluntarily sign consent forms.  
2. Health care providers are primary care providers, nurses, social workers and pharmacists 
who provide care to participating individuals . 
 Exclusion C riteria:  
Those with evidence of severe cognitive impairment or active psychosis that impedes their 
ability to provide informed consent will be excluded.  
Recruitment  
A combination of recruitment strategies will be used to help achieve the study’s enrolment goals. These include strategies such as posting flyers at clinics and community -based 
organizations , participant submission of contact [CONTACT_522555] 
(wyz.ucsf.edu) and contact[CONTACT_522556]. We will also 
work with a city -wide consortium of youth service providers and the CAPS Youth Advisory  Panel 
to disseminate study information to the target population. Enrolled participants will be encouraged to refer eligible peers and receive $10 incentive for the referee and the referred 
individual who participates. Lastly, participants from the principal investigator’s prior studies who had expressed interest and consented to be contact[CONTACT_522557], if still eligible.  
Procedures  
Eligibility screening  
Interested individuals will be provided a brief overview of the study goals and given the chance 
to ask questions. Individuals wishing to enroll in the study will be screened for eligibility. To 
confirm an individual’s age, we will require a photo identification showing their date of birth. To confirm an individual’s HIV serostatus, we will require a clinician’s letter of HIV diagnosis, copy of laboratory test results (for HIV antibody or HIV viral load), or the individual’s ART prescription showing their name. These documents can be sent as a text message to the encrypted and secure study phone for verification by [CONTACT_464].  
 
Consent and enroll ment 
To enroll in the study, individuals will review and sign an electronic consent form sent to them 
via Qualtrics (Provo, UT, [LOCATION_003]; version March 2017). All participants will be emailed a copy of the 
Experimental Subject’s Bill of Rights as mandated by [CONTACT_522558] a signed copy of their consent. If a participant does not have an email address, the study staff will assist them in signing up for one, as it will be necessary for gaining access to WYZ.  
 Participant retention  
A number of steps will be taken to engage and retain participants throughout the study period. First, participants will be asked for multiple forms of contact [CONTACT_3031] (including emergency contacts, clinical contacts and social media contacts) at the initial visit. They will receive monthly follow -up text messages to confirm that their contact [CONTACT_1343]. 
Finally, participants will receive reminder text messages 24 hours before scheduled study activities.  
 Participant incentives  
Participants can receive up to a total of $215 incentive for completing all study activities. They will receive $40 for the baseline session, which includes consent, application installation and baseline survey. They will then receive $10, $10, $15, $15, $20, $20 and $25 for participating in 
check -ins at weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16 and 20, respectively. For the final exit survey at week 24, 
participants will receive $40, and those who are invited to participate in the exit qualitative 
interview at this time will receive an additional $20. Part of this incentive is aimed at offsetting 
any data and text messaging fees associated with the application use. We estimate that 
participants will spend a total of 4 –4.[ADDRESS_677795], which will be used for the remote provision of study 
incentives. Finally, we will offer $50 to each healthcare provider for participating in a one -time 
qualitative interview.  
Outcome Measures  
The main outcomes of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_522553] 1. Feasibility will be assessed via user metrics by 
[CONTACT_522559]’s interactions with WYZ via a mobile analytics service called Flurry and 
backend (Salesforce) reporting tools (table 1). Acceptability will be examined during monthly check -ins 
to examine satisfaction with application use, the system usability scale (SUS),20 a study -developed 
acceptability survey and an exit qualitative interview. HIV viral load and CD4+ cell count will be collected to determine feasibility of collecting these measures at both baseline and study completion.

Feasibility metrics and threshold for determining feasibility  
Measure  Threshold (per user)  
General   
   Recruitment  Recruit at least 55 participants ( i.e., 70% of target n)  
   Number of log -ins Mean of 1 log -in per week  
   Mean number of minutes in 
application  Mean of 15 min in application per week  
My Health   
   Use of refill feature  Use of feature once monthly (if receiving 30 -day ART 
supply)  
   Use of ART adherence tracking  Track meds at least three times per week  
   Access of laboratory data  Review of laboratory data at least one time per month  
My Team   
   Communications with clinical team

My Community   
   Postchat or response to chats  Mean of one post or response to a post per week  
   Calendar and news  Minimum access once per week  
Administrative   
   Time for participant onboarding  Mean of [ADDRESS_677796] (including downloading app 
and reviewing app features)  
   Time to maintain and support 
application  <1 hour per participant per week (excludes first visit)  
   Mean number of app crashes reported  Fewer than one self -reported app crash per week  
 
Given that application use engagement is a complex and multifactorial concept, we aim to move beyond 
simple metrics. Therefore, in addition to feasibility measures detailed  in table 1, we will examine an 
engagement index (EI) that has been detailed in other mHealth interventions.21 The EI includes the 
following subindices: (1) click depth (number of pages a user views per session), (2) loyalty (measures how frequently users access the application during the study period), (3) recency (the time difference between each session the user accessed the application), (4) interaction (number of push notifications opened from those sent through the application), and (5) feedback (subjective measure of participants’ 
satisfaction with the application).  
Data Anal ysis Plan 
We have established minimum thresholds for determining the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention. Table 1 details these thresholds for the feasibility metrics. For acceptability, SUS scores 
range from 0 to 100 and scores >68 are considered above average. We will use a threshold of 70% or 
greater satisfaction to determine acceptability. Means and proportions w ill be computed at the study 
endpoint to enable descriptive evaluation of feasibility and acceptability. For EI, we will add all five 
subindices and examine cut -off points based on the distribution of the total samples’ EI scores and 
categorize  participants as either poorly, moderately or highly engaged.  
On completion of the study, up to [ADDRESS_677797] participants based on th eir EI category ( i.e., poor, moderate or high engagement), 
and interviews will occur until data saturation or until [ADDRESS_677798] been interviewed. The interviews will focus on the participant’s (1) attitudes towards exiting features; (2) attitudes and 
perceptions of pr ivacy and information security; (3) features that they would modify, add or eliminate; 
and (4) suggested modifications to increase engagement and sustained use of WYZ.  
Finally, we will conduct in- depth qualitative interviews with clinical team members whose patients 
participated in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]. The interview will focus on perceived (1) burden or ease of study 
procedures; (2) attitudes and beliefs regarding impact of the intervention on users’ engagement in HIV 
care and ART adherence; (3) sustainability and scalability of the application to other youth in the clinic; (4) challenges of integrating an application into clinical work; and (5) suggested modifications to improve usability. All interviews will be done by [CONTACT_648], digitally recorded, transcribed verbatim and 
deidentified. Transcriptions will be analyzed  using thematic and content analysis frameworks. This 
combination is useful in identifying implicit and explicit ideas within the data while also allowing for quantification of qualitative data.

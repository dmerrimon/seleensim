Study Objectives To assess the CNS metabolic biomarker profile and safety of CNM-Au8 for the treatment of Parkinson’s Disease (PD):  • Metabolic effects will be assessed as an improvement of 31P Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopic (31P-MRS) assessment of brain tissue cellular Redox potential defined by [CONTACT_116287]+:NADH concentrations and various bioenergetic markers. Safety will be assessed via adverse events, serious adverse events, discontinuations due to adverse events,  and the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS). Overall Study Design and Plan    This is a single-center open label pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], sequential group, investigator blinded study of the CNS metabolic effects, safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of CNM-Au8 in patients who have been diagnosed with Parkinson’s Disease (PD) within three (3) years of Screening. Patients will be screened over a 6-week period.  Patients who meet the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be enrolled into the clinical study.   The Sponsor will select a starting treatment dose of 15mg or 30mg CNM-Au8 for the initial treatment.  Investigators and patients will be blinded to each cohort’s study dose.  Upon completion of the first treatment cohort, the Sponsor will select a single dose or two different doses for the subsequent second cohort from a prespecified dosing selection plan based on the evaluation of the 31P-MRS changes versus baseline in the first cohort.  Up to a total of two treatment cohorts may be studied. All patients will receive daily oral treatment over twelve (12) consecutive weeks during each cohort’s Treatment Period. There will be three study periods per treatment cohort: 1. A (6) six week screening period (Screening Period); 2. A (12) twelve week treatment period (Treatment Period); 3. A (4) four-week follow-up period (End-of-Study Assessment). The primary study outcome, CNS metabolic changes, will be assessed based upon each patient’s Week 12 study visit versus the pre-treatment baseline. The study investigators and patients will remain blinded until the study database is formally locked. Patients will be contact[CONTACT_116288] 2. At Weeks 4, 8, and 12 patients will return to the clinic to complete 31P-MRS imaging (Week 12 only), PK, PD, and safety assessments.  At the end of the Treatment Period, patients will complete an end-of-study (EOS) visit.  All patients who are discontinued from treatment will complete the end-of-study visit.

Imaging Plan  MRI/MRS scans will be conducted on a Philips Achieva 7 Tesla human MRI scanner located in the Advanced Imaging Research Center at UTSW. Patients will undergo 31P MRS scans to measure brain phosphorous metabolites and redox state.  Whole Brain Metabolite Measurements:  Preparation: A cylinder bird-cage shaped 31P T/R volume coil insert (into a 1H T/R volume coil) will be used for imaging the brain stem. The head of the patient will be positioned in the center of the coil with soft cushion pads placed under and on the sides of the head to secure the positioning of the head and reduce potential movement during the scans.  After a scout image scan, axial, sagittal and coronal T2-weighted spin-echo multi-slice brain images will be collected using the typi[INVESTIGATOR_116246]: TR 3.5 sec, TE 80 ms, slice thickness 8 mm, gap 2 mm. A 2nd-order volume-based shimming will be conducted prior to 31P MRS data acquisition. 31P MRS scans: Whole brain 31P spectra will be acquired using three-dimensional chemical shift imaging (3D CSI) approach.  Typi[INVESTIGATOR_116247] = 0.5 sec, NP 2 k, BW 8 kHz, NA = 4 (short scan) and 16 (long scan), with spatial resolution of 2x2x2 cm3. If subjects are able to complete both short and long scans without movement artifact, the data will be combined. Otherwise, only the completed dataset without movement artefacts will be used for data analysis.  Voxel-based 31P spectra will be pooled together based on the functional regions (frontal, temporal, parietal and occipi[INVESTIGATOR_307]) to evaluate the spatial distributions of metabolites.  Data analysis will be performed by [CONTACT_116289] 31P resonances of all phosphorous metabolites using a previously developed Matlab program.   Partial Volume Coil Measurement: Preparation: A half-cylinder-shaped 1H/31P dual-tuned T/R partial volume coil will be used to image the posterior brain (occipi[INVESTIGATOR_116248]) for evaluation of the brain redox state based on the measurement of NAD+/NADH ratio.  Axial, sagittal and coronal T2-weighted spin-echo multi-slice images will be collected from the posterior head using the typi[INVESTIGATOR_116249] 3.5 sec and TE 80 ms, slice thickness 8 mm, gap 2 mm. A 2nd-order volume-based shimming will be conducted over the posterior brain region prior to 31P MRS data acquisition. 31P MRS scans: To obtain 31P spectra with resolved NAD from overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a-ATP signals, an inversion-recovery-based NAD spectral editing technique will be used.  Briefly, acquisition of a reference 31P spectrum using pulse-acquire sequence is conducted plus the acquisition of an additional spectrum using a sequence containing an adiabatic inversion pre-pulse followed by a short delay is 
  CNMAu8.202 Protocol (6.0) 09-Sep-2020  
Clene Nanomedicine, Inc. - Confidential & Proprietary - Page 7 of 135  
done to selectively nullify the NAD signal. A spectral subtraction will be performed to obtain an NAD-edited spectrum with resolved NAD signal from the reference spectrum.  The contribution of NAD+ and NADH to the resolved NAD signal will be quantified by [CONTACT_116290] a singlet and the NAD+ signal being a quartet (as defined by 31P coupled AB-spin system resonance pattern). The brain redox state will be calculated by [CONTACT_116291]+/NADH ratio. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_2855] 31P MRS parameters for data acquisition will be TR 1.0 sec, TD 0.17 ms, NP 4k and zero filled to 8k, BW 8 kHz, data accumulated in blocks of NA 256 or 512. For quantitative comparison of different metabolites in the posterior brain region, an additional scan will be performed, using the partial volume coil, under the fully relaxed T1 condition with long TR of 15 sec and 16 acquisition averages. Estimated Participant Study Duration The planned study duration for each participant will be approximately twenty-two (22) weeks from the start of Screening.  This assumes up to a 6-week Screening period; a 12-week Treatment Period; and a 4-week Follow-Up Safety Period.   Number of Patients Up to 30 patients planned between both cohorts; Up to 15 patients per cohort with 13 patients evaluable (assuming a ~20% drop-out rate): • Cohort Dose 1 (n = 15) • Cohort Dose 2 (n = 15) The Cohort 2 sample size may be re-calculated based on the mean change from baseline in NAD+/NADH Redox Ratio to Week [ADDRESS_129766] meet the following inclusion criteria: 1.

(pre-dose) and at 1, 2, 4, and [ADDRESS_129772] the patient and document the time at which the patient administered his/her prior day’s dose of study drug in order to impute a 24-hour trough value. The data will be used to estimate an apparent Cmax and Tmax and area under the curve (AUC) over the 24-hour dosing interval [AUC(0-24)].   Statistical Methods  The primary efficacy endpoint is mean change in NAD Redox Ratio from Baseline to Week 12. Redox Ratio is defined as: NAD Redox Ratio = mean NAD+/NADH  The statistical significance, comparing the result in each CNM-Au8 treatment to Baseline, will be reported. Statistical significance will be determined by [CONTACT_1192]-sided paired t-tests assessed at the p ≤ 0.05 significance level.   The Cohort 2 sample size may be re-calculated based on the mean change from baseline in NAD+/NADH Redox Ratio to Week [ADDRESS_129773] deviation of the change from Cohort 1.  Safety endpoints include incidence of treatment-emergent AEs, deaths, SAEs, AEs leading to discontinuation from the study and changes in the C-SSRS.  Changes from baseline in clinical laboratory results and vital signs will be summarized by [CONTACT_11571].    All safety summaries will be descriptive; no statistical significance tests will be performed on safety data and will be based on the safety population. Gold (Au) concentration data in whole blood will be summarized with descriptive statistics by [CONTACT_116295].

1 BACKGROUND INFORMATION 1.1 Disease Background and Pathophysiology Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a chronic, progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by [CONTACT_116298], bradykinesia, limb rigidity and gait and balance problems. Approximately one in one hundred individuals over the age of 60 is affected by [CONTACT_4002]. Both genetic and environmental factors are thought to contribute to the development of PD, and a combination of factors results in the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra area of the midbrain. PD is currently incurable; existing treatments for PD, such as dopamine agonists, COMT and MAO-B inhibitors, and deep brain stimulation, produce only a modest and temporary amelioration of symptoms. Specifically, long-term use of levodopa, a commonly-prescribed dopamine precursor used to treat Parkinsonian symptoms, results in dyskinesia that in itself becomes disabling. The global burden of PD is expected to further increase owing to population ageing (GBD 2016 Parkinson’s Disease Collaborators 2018). PD results in a large economic burden on society. Current major challenges in PD drug development include the lack of reliable biomarkers for its early diagnosis and for disease progression, the lack of a clear understanding of pathophysiologic mechanism(s) of PD, and lack of well-validated clinical trial tools to demonstrate neuroprotection (Arnerić, Kern, and Stephenson 2018; Olanow, Kieburtz, and Katz 2017).   Despi[INVESTIGATOR_116255], no disease-modifying or neuroprotective therapeutic for PD has been developed. A therapeutic that alters or slows the clinical progression, and thus improves PD patient quality of life and lifespan, represents a huge unmet need (Olanow, Kieburtz, and Katz 2017).  The pathophysiology of genetic and sporadic variants of PD, though multifactorial, appear to share common pathogenetic mechanisms, including impaired mitochondrial and lysosomal functions, neural sensitivity to glutamate toxicity, accumulation of oxidative stress, autophagic failure in clearing misfolded proteins, and loss of synapse integrity (Plotegher and Duchen 2017). These pathogenetic mechanisms all together are representative of processes of neuronal bioenergetic failure (Camandola and Mattson 2017). As such, improvement of cellular

Clene Nanomedicine, Inc. - Confidential & Proprietary - Page [ADDRESS_129790] that elevating brain NAD+ levels and improving cellular redox may be therapeutic for the treatment of PD and other neurodegenerative diseases (De Jesus-Cortes et al., 2012; Gong et al., 2013; Kim et al., 2017; Tesla et al., 2012; Zhou et al., 2015). As cells age, energy production capabilities decrease, mitochondria become damaged, and the redox potential of energy-producing molecules such as nicotine adenine dinucleotide (NAD/NADH) declines. NAD/NADH serve as a key redox couple in energy-producing pathways of the cell, including glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation.  An age-dependent decline of NAD/NADH redox has been previously demonstrated by 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy of the visual cortex in young, middle-aged, and aged healthy humans (Zhu et al. 2015).  In other studies, increasing intracellular levels of NADH and NAD+ have been demonstrated following administration of the precursor, nicotinamide, in cell and animal models of PD resulting in improvements in mitochondrial function and resistance to oxidative stress (Jia et al. 2008; Delgado-Camprubi et al. 2017; S. Lehmann et al. 2016; Susann Lehmann, Loh, and Martins 2017; Thirtamara-Rajamani et al. 2017; Schwab et al. 2017; Sison and Ebert 2018; Ocampo, Liu, and Barrientos 2013). Similarly, nicotinamide supplementation of culture media improved SK-N-MC neuroblastoma cell viability in response to the dopaminergic neural toxin MPTP, and feeding nicotinamide to transgenic alpha-synuclein (a-syn) overexpressing Drosophila improved climbing behavior (Jia et al. 2008). More recently, Schöndorf et al. demonstrated that increasing intracellular NAD+ using nicotinamide riboside supplementation rescued mitochondrial ultrastructure, reduced ROS levels, restored mitochondrial membrane potential, and increased the potential for mitophagy in PD iPSC-derived neurons (Schondorf et al. 2018). Taken together, these data all suggest that bioenergetic failure plays an important role in the pathophysiology of PD  and that agents that improve NAD/NADH redox states have the potential to treat this neurodegenerative disease.

Clene Nanomedicine, Inc. - Confidential & Proprietary - Page [ADDRESS_129791] Background   CNM-Au8 is an aqueous suspension of clean-surfaced nanocrystals consisting solely of Au atoms organized into crystals of highly faceted substantially uniform geometrical shapes. CNM-Au8 is supplied for dosing orally in sodium bicarbonate buffered USP purified water.   Historically, monomolecular gold complexes (e.g., injectable sodium aurothiomalate, aurothioglucose; oral auranofin) have been widely used historically as immunomodulating therapi[INVESTIGATOR_116256], predominantly rheumatoid arthritis (Dabrowiak, 2009).  However, multiple forms of toxicity, including pruritus, dermatitis, stomatitis, diarrhea, proteinuria, and less frequently hematological effects compromised the clinical use of gold complexes (Dabrowiak, 2009; Menninger et al., 1998).  While the role of gold in the pattern of toxicity remains unclear, it is hypothesized that adverse events (AEs) related to gold complexes may be specifically related to the monomolecular covalent formulations of the gold complexes rather than from the activity of gold per se (Dabrowiak, 2009; Yei Ho and Tiekink, 2005).   When functionalized as nanocrystals, gold adopts novel electrochemical characteristics unlike those of gold complexes.  In addition, as clean-faceted nanocrystals CNM-Au8 has unique properties including a clean safety and tolerability profile as well as high level of biocatalytic activity in cells that is unlike that of gold nanoparticles manufactured using traditional methods that require stabilizing or residual chemical modifications to the particles’ surfaces. The faceted gold nanocrystals of CNM-Au8 generally consist of shapes including hexagonal bi-pyramids, pentagonal bi-pyramids, tetrahedrons, and octahedrons.  These crystalline shapes, absent organic residues on their surfaces, are central to the biologic activity of CNM-Au8.  In contrast to molecular covalently bound gold compounds (e.g., historical gold salts), or colloidal gold nanoparticles containing surface residue or surfactants as a surface layer (e.g., polyethylene glycol (PEG), cetyl trimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), citrate, thiols, other surfactants), CNM-Au8 consists solely of nanocrystals grown through an electro-crystal chemistry process, which produces consistently faceted catalytically active geometrical shapes (without utilizing surfactants such as those derived from the reduction of chloroauric acid (HAuCl4)).

The characteristics of a nanoparticle’s size, shape, and surface chemistry impact, and can define, the biological activity of the nanoparticles.  Residual surface chemistry also affects the biological activity of nanoparticles and directly impacts cellular uptake.  Nanoparticle surfactants and residual chemical monolayers are also well-known to cause nanoparticle toxicity (Balasubramanian et al., 2010; Freese et al., 2012; Qiu et al., 2010). In summary, CNM-Au8 was rationally designed to eliminate the need for residual surface chemistry, and to promote biocatalytic activity on it’s clean-surfaced, faceted nanocrystalline surfaces.  CNM-Au8 is a novel therapeutic paradigm as a suspension of non-covalently bound faceted clean-surfaced Au nanocrystals.   1.2.[ADDRESS_129792] Characteristics The median diameter of CNM-Au8 nanocrystals is approximately 13 nm, as determined by [CONTACT_116299] (TEM).  Based upon the distributed range (Dn5 – Dn95: 6.5 – 15.8 nm) of measured nanocrystal diameters and approximate geometrical shapes (e.g., low volume estimate: disc-like approximation, aspect ratio of 0.2; maximum volume estimate: spheroid, aspect ratio of 1.0), each Au nanocrystal has an approximate composition ranging from 13,000 – 66,000 Au atoms per nanocrystal at the 13 nm median diameter with a corresponding molar mass ranging between 2.7 x 103 kDA to 1.3 x 104 kDA. Summary estimates for CNM-Au8 mass, volume, and particle characteristics are described below in Table 2.  Each mL of CNM-Au8 suspension at 500 μg/mL is estimated to contain between 100 - 500 trillion highly faceted Au nanocrystals.

Cellular uptake of CNM-Au8 has been demonstrated in a variety of cells and tissue matrices including macrophages, oligodendrocytes, neurons, and brain tissue using Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) analyses and high resolution TEM visualization of nanocrystals.   Preclinical characterization of the in vitro and in vivo properties of CNM-Au8 have demonstrated that it acts to protect neuronal populations from chemical, inflammatory, and hypoxic insults through a series of unique catalytic mechanisms involving 1) the nicotine adenine dinucleotide redox couple (NAD+/NADH) to boost glycolytic energy production, 2) the nicotine adenine dinucleotide phosphate redox couple (NADP+/NADPH) to influence anabolic processes associated with differentiation, and 3) the SOD-like inactivation of reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide to protect cells from oxidative damage and mitochondrial dysfunction.  The nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide redox couple (NAD+, NADH) plays a central role in the energy metabolism of all living cells. NAD+, NADH and their relative intracellular ratio (NAD+/NADH) are linked to regulation of energy homeostasis, neuroprotection, immune

function, chromosome stability, DNA repair mechanisms, sleep and circadian rhythms, and longevity (Canto et al., 2015; Imai, 2010a, b; Nikiforov et al., 2015; Ying, 2008).  Fundamentally, NAD+ and NADH are essential coenzymes in the adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-generating reactions driving both glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation.  More specifically, in aerobic glycolysis, NAD+ availability is integral to the enzymatic cascade from glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate via glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase to 1,3-bisphosphoglyceric acid.  Similarly, two electrons are removed via NADH oxidation in Complex I of the electron transport chain during oxidative phosphorylation, resulting in NAD+, and ultimately these electrons are transferred to a lipid-soluble carrier, ubiquinone. In addition, NAD+ and its metabolites act as binding substrates for a wide range of proteins including the metabolic and transcription-regulating sirtuins, the poly-ADP-ribose polymerases (PARPs) involved in DNA repair, and the cyclic ADP-ribose synthases (cADPRs) such as CD38 that serve to regulate Ca2+ signaling involved in cell cycle control and insulin signaling (Canto et al., 2015). NAD+ and NADH are essential for life; dietary deficiency of vitamin B3, a NAD+ precursor,  gives rise to a life-threatening condition known as pellagra, which is characterized by a dark, pi[INVESTIGATOR_116257], diarrhea, and dementia (Sydenstricker, 1958). Transgenic mice lacking both copi[INVESTIGATOR_116258]+ salvage enzyme Nmnat1 resulting in NAD+ deficiency, do not live past embryonic stages (Conforti et al., 2011). Conversely, the heightened expression of NMNAT1, resulting in increased NAD+ in the Wallerian Degeneration Slow Dominant Mutant Mouse, has been attributed to neuronal protection against axon degeneration observed in these mice (Sasaki et al., 2009).   Quantitative measurement of regional brain area NAD+ concentrations and redox states in healthy and diseased humans has recently been demonstrated using a novel 31P-Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) imaging technique (Chouinard et al., 2017; Lu et al., 2016). In humans, brain NAD+/NADH redox potential is inversely correlated with age. This age-related decrease in cerebral energy metabolism is believed to be intimately associated with the bioenergetic failure that may underpin the pathophysiology of all neurodegenerative diseases, because NAD+/NADH redox potential is essential for fundamental ATP-generating processes

such as glycolysis and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. These bioenergetic processes power all cellular processes including ‘housekeepi[INVESTIGATOR_007]’ functions that are responsible for maintaining overall cellular health including processes of autophagy, apoptosis, and the unfolded protein response (UPR) (Villanueva-Paz et al. 2016; Chua and Tang 2013; Cantó, Menzies, and Auwerx 2015). Boosting brain NAD+ levels in a mouse model of AD reduced DNA damage, neuroinflammation, and apoptosis while improving cognitive function in multiple behavioral tests and restored hippocampal synaptic plasticity (Hou et al., 2018). In humans, 31P-MRS of the visual cortex of young (21-26 year old), middle-aged (33-36 year old), and aged (59-68 year old) healthy individuals has been show to demonstrate a measurable linear decline of NAD+ redox potential that occurs with increasing age (Zhu et al., 2015). The first demonstration of oxidation of NADH to NAD+ by [CONTACT_116300]. (2005) using a simple cell-free assay. In order to compare the catalytic oxidation rate of clean-surfaced CNM-Au8 against similarly-sized gold nanoparticles made using citrate reduction, the same cell-free assay utilized by [CONTACT_26134]. was repeated comparing gold nanoparticles sourced from the U.S. National Institutes of Standards and Technology (NIST).  The resulting change in the 339 nm NADH peak was assessed while investigating each of the gold nanoparticles at the same NADH and Au starting concentrations.  In all cases, CNM-Au8 nanocrystals consistently showed significantly superior catalytic activities regardless of size and/or method of preparation of the comparator gold nanoparticles, (Figure 1).

  CNM-Au8 treatment of rodent central nervous system cells in vitro also significantly increases levels of both NAD+ and NADH (Figure 2).  Figure 2.

  The redox couple NADP+/NADPH, similar  to NAD+/NADH, plays a fundamental role in energy homeostasis, anabolic processes, and protection against oxidative stress. NADP+ and NADPH function in the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), serves to provide precursors for nucleotide and amino acid biosynthesis (Stincone et al., 2015). In addition, NADP+ and NADPH serve as the redox equivalents for both the thioredoxin and glutathione systems (Grant, 2008; Pollak et al., 2007), which in turn serve as the cell’s primary defenses against oxidative stress.  0510152025300.[IP_ADDRESS].180.200.220.24NADH control, no GNPsNIST 30nmNIST 10nm

CNM-Au8 catalyzes the oxidation of NADPH to NADP+ (Figure 3). While the time course of catalysis of NADPH to NADP+ is longer than that observed for conversion of NADH to NAD+, the magnitude of the effect is similar. Thus, CNM-Au8 plays an important role in providing NADP+ to the enzyme glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase for the conversion of 6-phosphogluconate to ribulose 5-phosphate and NADPH + CO2, which represents the rate-limiting step of the oxidative branch of the PPP.

 Excessive reactive oxygen exposure disrupts cellular redox homeostasis, damages intracellular organelles as well as DNA and proteins, and may also underpin pathophysiologic mechanisms of PD (Puspi[INVESTIGATOR_17399], Chung, and Shim 2017).  Super oxide dismutases (SODs) evolved as a component of the cell’s antioxidant defense system to regulate the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and prevent damage from oxidative stress. SOD enzymes are found in the cytoplasm and mitochondria where they convert oxygen radicals to O2 or H2O2, which can in turn be converted to water and O2 by [CONTACT_116301].  A dose-dependent reduction of ROS levels was observed in differentiating oligodendrocyte precursor cells in primary culture with CNM-Au8 treatment (Figure 4).

In addition, SOD1 may act not only as a regulator of ROS but also as a part of a glucose-oxygen sensing mechanism of a cell to determine whether the cell utilizes oxidative phosphorylation or aerobic glycolysis for ATP production (Reddi and Culotta, 2013). A study of oligodendrocyte (OL) energetics showed that human OLs preferentially use aerobic glycolysis during differentiation and myelination

(Rone et al., 2016).  Data with CNM-Au8 demonstrate that treatment switches OPCs from proliferation to differentiation, while simultaneously stimulating aerobic glycolysis production of ATP likely through NADH oxidation (Figure 5).  Stimulation of SOD-like activity therefore is consistent with a role for CNM-Au8 in regulating cellular bioenergetics.  Figure 5. Effect of CNM-Au8 on OPC Differentiation and ATP Production

Statistical analysis performed using one-way ANOVA (p < 0.05). 1.4 CNM-Au8 Parkinson’s Disease Neuroprotection Models  1.4.1 In vitro Dopaminergic Neuroprotection Models In vitro models of neuroprotection were conducted to assess the neuroprotective role of CNM-Au8’s bioenergetic mechanism of action.  Treatment with the neurotoxins: methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6 tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) and 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) results in oxidative stress and impairment of neuronal mitochondrial function  (Dauer and Przedborski 2003).   CNM-Au8 was studied in rat primary mesencephalic neurons injured with MPP+ or 6-OHDA.  The primary assessment was protection of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-expressing neurons and neurite network preservation. In addition, impairment of mitochondria function induced by [CONTACT_116302] (ATP pool), oxidative stress (ROS), and mitochondria function.   MPP+ (4 µM, 48 h) induced significant TH+ neuronal death (~35 %) and loss of the neurite network (~40 %) in primary rat dopaminergic neurons. In the presence of CNM-Au8 (pre-incubated 48 hours before MPP+), a significant dose-dependent neuroprotective effect was

observed (Figure 6) . A dose-dependent neuroprotective effect on neurite network area was also observed. Furthermore, addition of the neurotoxin MPP+ induced a significant decrease of number of mitochondria in the cytoplasm of TH+ neurons. Pretreatment with CNM-Au8 for 48 hours significantly protected neurons from depletion of mitochondria (Figure 7). Consistent with the MPP+ results, 6-OHDA (20 µM, 48h) also induced a significant TH+ neuronal death (~30 %) and a large loss of the neurite network (~40%). The presence of CNM-Au8 (pre-incubated 48 hours before 6-OHDA), also showed a significant dose-dependent protective effect on neuronal survival (Figure 8).  Figure 6.

TH positive neurons demonstrated α-syn aggregates in their cytoplasm after 6-OHDA treatment and treatment with CNM-Au8 significantly and dose-dependently prevented intracellular α-synuclein aggregation. CNM-Au8 also significantly reduced the size of the α-synuclein aggregates (Figure 9). Figure 9. Effect Of CNM-Au8 On α-Synuclein Presence In TH+ Neurons and α-Syn Aggregates Following 6-OHDA Injury

 Taken together, these in vivo data demonstrate a significant neuroprotective effect of CNM-Au8 in behavioral models of Parkinson’s Disease. In summary, CNM-Au8 has demonstrated neuroprotective effects in both in vitro and in vivo dopaminergic toxin-induced models of PD. Treatment with CNM-Au8 significantly increases cell viability while significantly reducing detectable intracellular alpha-synuclein (a-syn) aggregates within dopaminergic neurons exposed to the toxins MPTP and 6-OHDA. Functional in vivo studies using a standard 6-OHDA unilateral lesion rat model have further demonstrated CNM-Au8’s efficacy.  The unique intracellular catalytic mechanism of action, positions CNM-Au8 as a promising therapeutic for the treatment of PD.

2 SUMMARY OF NONCLINICAL SAFETY & TOXICOLOGY STUDIES The Sponsor has conducted multiple safety and toxicology studies with CNM-Au8 in accordance with ICH M3 (R2) guidelines across three species including rats, minipi[INVESTIGATOR_14107], and canines, in addition to standard in vitro mutagenicity studies.  Initial in vivo dosing levels were modeled on delivering comparable amounts of gold as the historical gold complex, auranofin, to a 50-kg patient on a milligram per kilogram basis without adjustments for body surface area variance between species.  This resulted in target nonclinical daily doses of Au at an estimated 0.0348 mg/kg/day, which were increased 10-fold (0.348 mg/kg) and 100-fold (3.48 mg/kg) to provide an anticipated safety margin for planned human dosing. 2.[ADDRESS_129802] of CNM-Au8 on cytotoxicity or mutation frequency as summarized below in Table 3.

 2.2 Summary of Safety Pharmacology Studies Safety pharmacology assessments included testing of three doses of CNM-Au8 (0.0348, 0.348 and 3.48 mg/kg) in rodents in the standard CNS Irwin test and the same dosing regimen for assessment of renal function following saline overload.  Cardiovascular safety was assessed by [CONTACT_116304][INVESTIGATOR_14107].  The CNS Irwin testing protocol provided no evidence CNM-Au8 affected central and peripheral neurologic function.  Similarly, renal function was not affected in Han Wistar rats following saline overload.  Telemetry recording of cardiovascular responses in minipi[INVESTIGATOR_116260], blood pressure, ECG, and body temperature demonstrated no negative effects of CNM-Au8 on cardiovascular function.

[IP_ADDRESS] Study AB17834 (28-Day Repeat Dose Toxicity in Göttingen Minipig) At the end of the treatment period in Study AB17834, a lower platelet count from the pretest baseline was noted in 3 animals as described in Table 6, below. One female in Group 2 (low dose) and one in Group 3 (intermediate dose) had very low levels of platelets counts, and one male in Group 4 (high dose) group had a significant reduction.

Review of historical data sets revealed that the platelet count in the peripheral blood of the minipig is highly variable and low platelet counts have sporadically been observed in untreated minipi[INVESTIGATOR_116265] (Eurofins).  Further examination of bone marrow smears revealed no treatment-related differences in group means or individual Myeloid:Erythroid (M:E) ratios.  Female no. 317 had a low M:E ratio due to higher proportion of erythroid precursors, which correlated with the histopathological observation of a high cellularity of the bone marrow.  These changes were consistent with a hyperplastic change of the erythroid compartment, not accompanied by [CONTACT_116305].  There were no cytological abnormalities correlating with the severe decrease in platelet counts observed at necropsy in treated female nos. 310 and 317 and at lower severity in male no. 321.  It

There were also no treatment-related differences in M:E ratio (group mean and individual values) or in absolute and relative counts of myeloid, erythroid, and lymphoid cell series. To date, no significant platelet reductions have been observed in any of the toxicology studies conducted in rodents or canines. 2.3.2 Maximum Feasible Dose Study and High Dose Subchronic Toxicity Studies in Rodents and Minipi[INVESTIGATOR_116266] (IND) application to the U.S. FDA, the Agency requested additional higher dose studies to identify a maximum tolerated dose, or alternatively a maximum feasible dose.  Subsequently, a 7-day maximum feasible dose study was conducted in rats with subcutaneous (SC) dosing compared to 90 mg/kg oral gavage (OG) dosing.  The maximal feasible dose (MFD) represented the highest concentration of CNM-Au8 (3000 parts per million, 3 mg/mL) that could be manufactured with currently available techniques dosed at the maximum permissible dosing volume delivered via gavage or SC administration.  Of note, the 3 mg/mL concentration used in the two MFD studies had deviations out of product specification (hydrodynamic radius of 54.38 nm, which exceeded the production specification range of 10 – 30 nm) likely indicating nanoparticle agglomeration.  In rodents, doses of 5, 15, 30 and 90 mg/kg/day over seven consecutive days, were administered in a divided dose, i.e., twice daily subcutaneously (2.5, 7.5 and 15 mg/kg, BID) or, orally, three times daily (30 mg/kg TID; 90 mg/kg/day). The three times daily oral gavage administration was well tolerated by [CONTACT_116306]. Test-article related findings that were not adverse, included discolored feces (black), decreased body weight gain and food consumption when compared to controls, and anatomic pathology findings of extramedullary hematopoiesis noted in the spleen and/or liver.  This study defined 90 mg/kg/day as the NOAEL with oral gavage administration.

The skin was thickened/leathery in all treatment groups with associated changes in clinical pathology, defined by [CONTACT_116307]; and anatomic pathology, defined by [CONTACT_116308]/chronic inflammation, edema, and cavitation in the injection sites, which were considered adverse in their totality.  Systemic test article-related changes not considered adverse were noted in body weights (decreased gain), food consumption (decreased), and anatomic pathology (increased spleen weights, and extramedullary hematopoiesis in the spleen and liver).  Accordingly, a NOAEL could not be established in the rodents receiving daily SC administration up to 30 mg/kg.   With twice-daily SC administration of CNM-Au8, blood Au exposures increased proportionally or slightly greater than proportionally from 5 to 30 mg/kg/day on Day 1 and Day 7.  Blood Au exposures after SC administration were considerably higher than after oral gavage administration with the dose normalized AUC(0-Last) ratio (SC:OG) ranging from approximately 9x – 50x higher dose-normalized AUC depending upon animal gender and the SC dose.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_116267], no systemic toxicities were observed with SC administration.

Toxicokinetic (TK) assessment [whole blood, urine, cerebral spi[INVESTIGATOR_872] (CSF), and designated frozen tissues] was conducted for gold content.   There were no definitive test article-related mortalities and no test article-related effects on body weight, food consumption, ophthalmoscopic examinations; clinical pathology, macroscopic examinations and organ weights. Based on the data from the detailed clinical observations, body weight, food consumption, clinical and anatomical pathology, oral doses of CNM-Au8 at 10, 20, and 40 mg/kg/day resulted in no adverse findings of these rats. Therefore, the NOAEL for this study was considered to be 40 mg/kg/day, the highest dose tested.  Table 8. Chronic Rodent Toxicity Study

2.4.1 Single Dose Canine Toxicokinetic Summary After intravenous (IV) administration, the mean CNM-Au8 whole blood estimated concentration at time zero (C0) was calculated as 9.39 ng/mL (range 4.97 to 18.4 ng/mL) extrapolated using a log-linear regression from the first two measured concentrations.  The first blood sample after IV dosing was collected at 30 minutes postdose, so it is possible that the concentration at 30 minutes underestimates C0.  After oral administration, maximum CNM-Au8 plasma concentrations were observed at a Tmax range of 4 – 48 hours and 12 – 48 hours postdose for the 3.5 and 10 mg/kg cohorts, respectively.  Due to limited interpretable data points above the lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) in the IV dosing group, AUC∞ was not calculated, and absolute bioavailability (F) was therefore calculated using the mean values for AUC0-336 from two of six animals with quantifiable Au whole blood concentrations to 336 hours.  As shown in Table 10 was 30.5% for the 3.5 mg/kg group and 20.5% for the 10 mg/kg group.  The difference may be due to the use of different animals in the 3 cohorts rather than a true difference in bioavailability.  The mean Cmax value at 3.5 mg/kg includes two animals with CNM-Au8 concentrations all below the lower limit of quantitation with subsequent Cmax values set to zero, so the reported Cmax value may be an underestimate in this dosing group.

In the IV dosing group, feces concentrations were all below the LLOQ (<150 ng/mL); however, identification of CNM-Au8 above the lower limit of detection (LLOD) in the feces over the 2-week period established the feces as a route of elimination.  Quantifiable urine concentrations were observed between 36 to 48 hours postdose in the 0.5 mg/kg IV dosing group, confirming urine as an elimination pathway.   Urinary excretion data were not collected at consistent intervals with whole blood concentration, so renal clearance could not be calculated.   Peak urine concentrations in the 3.5 and 10 mg/kg groups occurred between 12 – 24 hours and 36 – 48 hours, respectively, and exceeded whole blood concentrations. Mean values for half-life (T1/2), clearance (CL), volume of distribution (Vz), and volume of distribution at steady state (Vss), respectively, for the 0.5 mg/kg IV dosing group are shown in Table 11.

CNM-Au8 was well tolerated when administered at gold concentrations of 0.35, 3.5, and 10 mg/kg/day as a single daily dose of 1mg/mL CNM-Au8 via oral gavage, and the10 mg/kg/day dose was considered the NOAEL. There were no significant changes in serum chemistry or hematology measures or in the macroscopic or histologic assessments post-necropsy. In terms of toxicokinetics, systemic exposure appeared independent of gender. There was an increase in Cmax from 0.35 to 3.5 mg/kg, but no apparent change from 3.5 to 10 mg/kg, suggesting a plateau in exposure to 3.5 and 10 mg/kg. Mean systemic exposure AUC(0-24 hr) accumulated in whole blood following repeated administration over the first two weeks, with no significant change in accumulation ratio (Rac) after that time, indicating that steady-state was reached within 2 weeks of dosing.

half-life (T1/2) was long; 333 hours (13.9 days) in the 10 mg/kg dose group.  During the recovery elimination phase, gold levels were still quantifiable at 4-weeks post-dosing in both blood and tissue.  Whole blood Au concentrations are shown in Figure 11. Figure 11. Whole Blood Concentrations by [CONTACT_116310] 28-Day Repeat Dosing Canine Study 
 A noteworthy finding in the three-animal species studied was a disproportionate tissue concentration of gold measured in the kidney. This renal accumulation was not accompanied by [CONTACT_116311], as measured by [CONTACT_116312], urinalysis, or structural changes identified in the histologic examination of the kidney. In the 4-week recovery period in the 28-day dog study, gold concentrations in the kidney decreased significantly over that recovery period, and continuing urinary excretion of gold was measured throughout the recovery period. 2.4.3 Maximum Feasible Dose Canine Toxicokinetic Study In the canine maximum feasible dose study, the doses administered were 30 mg/kg/day (QD), 60mg/kg/day (30 mg/kg BID), or 90 mg/kg/day (30 mg/kg TID) over three consecutive weeks (21-days). Dosing was well tolerated in the dogs over the [ADDRESS_129812] dose, 90mg/kg/day, minimal bilateral tubular cell hypertrophy was observed in the kidneys of males and females but was considered non-adverse by [CONTACT_116313] [INVESTIGATOR_116268]-toxicologist.

No deaths occurred. Treatment-related salivation and black discolored feces were observed at 60 and 90 mg/kg/day. No treatment-related effects were observed on body weights, food consumption, ophthalmology, ECGs, clinical pathology parameters, organ weights or macroscopic examinations. There was slightly less than a proportional increase in gold exposure when the dose was increased from 30 to 60 mg/kg/day. Increasing the dose from 60 to 90 mg/kg/day was not generally accompanied by [CONTACT_116314]. Thus, maximal systemic exposure in the dogs may occur with a dose of 60mg/kg/day divided into two daily oral doses of 30 mg/kg. Accumulation appeared to plateau by [CONTACT_2006] 7, with no substantive increase in exposure on Days 14 and 21. Blood gold exposures at steady-state were approximately 1.1 to 3.3 times higher than on Day 1, and the extent of the accumulation tended to be lower with higher doses.  Systemic gold concentration appears to be approximately at steady state after 1 to 2 weeks of dosing. Systemic exposure appears to be higher in female dogs than in male dogs.  2.4.4 Chronic Canine Toxicology (9-Month Dosing) The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential toxicity of the test article in beagle dogs when administered orally via gavage once daily for [ADDRESS_129813] dose observation period after each termination. Assessment of toxicity was based on mortality, clinical observations, body weight, and food consumption; ophthalmoscopic, and electrocardiographic examinations; and clinical and anatomic pathology. Blood, urine, CSF, and designated frozen tissues were analyzed for gold content. Toxicokinetic assessment for gold content in blood and urine was conducted. Results are summarized in Table 13. No early deaths occurred. There were no treatment-related clinical signs of toxicity observed, no effects on body weight or food consumption, or during ophthalmoscopic observations or electrocardiographic examinations. There were no test article-related effects among clinical pathology parameters noted during the interim dosing and recovery periods. No organ weight changes were observed and no test article related macroscopic or microscopic findings were observed at the interim or recovery necropsies.

CNM-Au8 was well tolerated in dogs when administered at doses of 0.35, 3.5 and 10 mg/kg/day for 39-weeks.  No adverse signs of toxicity were observed at any dose level. Therefore, the dose of 10 mg/kg/day was considered the NOAEL in dogs following oral administration. Table 13. Chronic Canine Toxicity Study

Clene Nanomedicine, Inc. - Confidential & Proprietary - Page [ADDRESS_129815]-Time-In-Human study was previously conducted under a clinical trial application (CTA) in the Netherlands (AU8.1000-14-01). The study was a 2-phase, randomized, double˗blind, single- and multiple-dose escalating study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and PK of CNM˗Au8 in healthy male and female volunteers. There were 2 phases to this study: a single ascending dose (SAD) Phase and a multiple ascending dose (MAD) Phase. The SAD Phase was conducted first, followed by [CONTACT_116315]. 3.1 AU8.1000-14-01 Design A total of 8 subjects per cohort were randomly assigned (3:1 ratio) to receive a single dose of either CNM˗Au8 (n = 6) or placebo (n = 2) at an initial dose level of 15 mg CNM-Au8. Additional cohorts of 8 subjects were enrolled to investigate single-escalating doses of CNM-Au8 at 30 mg, 60 mg, and 90 mg. Cohorts were to be balanced by [CONTACT_116316]-thirds of subjects being of one gender.  Safety parameters included findings from electrocardiograms (ECGs), vital signs, clinical laboratory panels, physical examinations, urinalysis, AEs, and concomitant medications. A follow-up visit was conducted for final safety assessments on Day 17 ± 1. After the SAD Phase was completed, a total of 12 subjects per cohort were randomly assigned (3:1 ratio) to receive a multiple dose of either CNM-Au8 (n = 9) or placebo (n = 3) once daily for 21 days at an initial dose level of 15 mg CNM-Au8. Additional cohorts of 12 subjects were enrolled to investigate multiple escalating doses of CNM-Au8 at 30 mg, 60 mg, and 90 mg. Cohorts were balanced by [CONTACT_547], with no more than two-thirds of subjects being of one gender.  Following the final dose of study drug on Day 21, subjects entered a 28-Day follow-up phase and returned to the clinical research unit (CRU) for PK sampling on Days 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 32, 36, 40, and 49, which completed study participation.  Safety parameters included findings from ECGs, vital signs, clinical laboratory panels, physical examinations, urinalysis, AEs, and concomitant medications.

3.2 AU8.1000-14-01 Pharmacokinetic Results The PK Population included all randomized subjects who received CNM-Au8 study drug and had sufficient samples collected for estimation of PK parameters. • The PK Population for the SAD Phase included 24 subjects who received a single dose of CNM˗Au8 study drug at 15 mg, 30 mg, 60 mg, and 90 mg. • The PK Population for the MAD Phase included a total of 35 subjects: 8 subjects in the 15 mg dosing group and 9 subjects each in the other 3 cohorts who received multiple doses of CNM-Au8 study drug at 30 mg, 60 mg, and 90 mg (Cohorts 5–8). In the SAD Phase, PK analyses were not completed since the majority of whole blood Au concentrations were below the LLOQ. Since the lack of quantitation of Au concentrations may have been related to ICP-MS assay sensitivity, the Sponsor upgraded to an advanced, more sensitive, ICP-MS instrument for the PK analyses in the MAD Phase. In the MAD Phase: • The geometric mean whole blood concentrations from [ADDRESS_129816] increased in a dose related, but not a dose-proportional manner. Based on Days 14 and 21, the increases in both Cmax and AUC(0-24) were less than dose proportional. • Based on pre-specified fit criteria, the elimination t½ ranged from 277 to 628 hr (11.5 to 26.2 days). • Steady-state for all cohorts, based on the geometric mean whole blood concentrations, was reached by [CONTACT_116317] (Day 14), which was substantially less than predicted by [CONTACT_941] t½ [range of 46 to 105 days (6.6 to 15 weeks)]. PK parameters related to urinary excretion (Ue, CLr) could not be calculated.

The Safety Population included 40 subjects in the SAD Phase, 46 subjects in the MAD Phase, and 86 subjects in the Pooled (SAD + MAD) group. All planned dose cohorts were completed, and the Safety Review Committee (SRC) agreed to escalate to each subsequent dose cohort per the protocol. An MTD was not identified. All subjects in the SAD Phase completed a single oral dose per protocol. In the MAD Phase, the mean duration of treatment was 21.[ADDRESS_129818] (subject 0085-MAD 90 mg) in the MAD Phase did not complete the 21 days of consecutive dosing per protocol due to a reported pregnancy after 13 days of consecutive dosing, and had a medically induced abortion 7 days later. For the SAD and MAD Phases of the study, the overall incidence of TEAEs was comparable between treatments, including placebo; overall incidence of TEAEs considered related to study drug by [CONTACT_116318], including placebo.  The most frequently reported TEAEs were in the classes of Nervous system disorders and Gastrointestinal disorders. The majority of TEAEs were Grade 1 severity (mild). There were no serious TEAEs, TEAEs leading to discontinuation of treatment, or TEAEs considered severe, life threatening, or resulting in death. Overall, no dose response relationship to TEAEs was observed in the SAD or MAD Phase of the study; however, the frequency of headache and gastrointestinal TEAEs was higher in the 90 mg MAD treated subjects. In the SAD Phase, TEAEs considered related to study drug by [CONTACT_116319] 2 (16.7%) out of 12 subjects in the 15 mg group, 2 (33.3%) out of 6 subjects in the 30 mg group, 4 (66.7%) out of 6 subjects in the 60 mg group, and 5 (83.3%) out of 6 subjects in the 90 mg group compared with 7 (70.0%) out of 10 subjects in the placebo group. All related TEAEs were Grade 1 severity (mild) in the SAD Phase, except for 2 related TEAEs (diarrhea and abdominal pain: both in Subject 0024-SAD 60 mg) that were considered Grade 2 severity (moderate). In the MAD Phase, TEAEs considered related to study drug by [CONTACT_116319] 5 (62.5%) out of 8 subjects in the 15 mg, 4 (44.4%) out of 9 subjects in the 30 mg, 3 (33.3%) out 
  CNMAu8.202 Protocol (6.0) 09-Sep-2020  
Clene Nanomedicine, Inc. - Confidential & Proprietary - Page 61 of 135  
of 9 subjects in the 60 mg, 8 (88.9%) out 9 subjects in the 90 mg, and 6 (54.5%) 11 subjects in the placebo group. All related TEAEs in the MAD Phase were Grade 1 severity (mild). Modified treatment emergent events were defined as a treatment emergent adverse event that started within [ADDRESS_129819] dose of study medication. Modified TEAEs for all CNM-Au8 doses were reported by 11 (36.7%) out of 30 subjects in the SAD Phase, 7 (20.0%) out of 35 subjects in the MAD Phase, and 18 (27.7%) out of 65 subjects in the Pooled (SAD + MAD) group. A total of 9 (42.9%) out of [ADDRESS_129820] (AESIs). All AESIs were considered Grade 1 severity (mild), except for 2 TEAEs of Grade 2 severity (moderate): diarrhea and abdominal pain in the same subject (Subject 0024-SAD 60 mg). Incidence rates were comparable between all dosing groups including placebo. Dosing with either a single dose or multiple doses of CNM-Au8 was generally well tolerated over the course of this study. The most frequently reported TEAEs in the pooled population were headache, somnolence, fatigue, abdominal pain upper, diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain, and dizziness.   Oral administration of either a single (SAD) or repeated dose (MAD) of CNM-Au8 over 21 consecutive days in healthy volunteers was safe and well tolerated. The TEAEs observed across the 4 doses (15 mg, 30 mg, 60 mg, and 90 mg) of CNM-Au8 were mostly mild in severity. While no dose response relationship to TEAEs was observed overall in the SAD or MAD Phase of the study, increases in headache and gastrointestinal related TEAEs were observed in the 90 mg cohort of the MAD Phase. Overall, for both the SAD and MAD Phases, routine clinical laboratory assessments (hematology, serum chemistry, and urinalysis), vital signs, ECGs, and physical examinations did not reveal clinically notable findings or trends; none resulted in serious TEAEs or TEAEs leading to discontinuation of treatment.

4 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN 4.1 Study Rational  CNM-Au8 has been studied in several preclinical Parkinson’s Disease Models and has demonstrated significant neuroprotection in these models. Through a mechanism of action targeting restoration of cellular redox homeostasis, CNM-Au8 addresses pathophysiologic bioenergetic failure in neurons that may underlie the pathogenesis of Parkinson’s Disease and other neurodegenerative diseases. CNM-Au8 acts on bioenergetics to protect sensitive neuronal populations from chemical, inflammatory, and hypoxic insults through a unique mechanism promoting cellular redox homeostasis that involves the catalytic oxidation of NADH resulting in enhanced aerobic glycolytic energy production. The primary objective of this investigator-blinded, open labeled, randomized, Clinical Phase 2 trial is to study the effects on brain NAD+/NADH redox potential of 12-weeks of treatment with CNM-Au8 using 31P-Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy in patients with Parkinson’s Disease.  Measurement of regional brain NAD+/NADH concentrations in healthy human subjects and in patients with schizophrenia has been demonstrated using 31P-MRS (Chouinard et al., 2017; Lu et al., 2016). In humans, brain NAD/NADH redox potential is inversely correlated with age and has been shown to decrease linearly with advancing age in healthy human subjects (Zhu et al. 2015) shown in Figure 12 below.

Figure 12.  NAD Redox Potential In Adult Humans 
 Age dependences of NAD+/NADH redox potential observed in healthy human brains. The open symbols represent individual subject data, and the filled symbols display the average data from three age groups of younger (21–26 y old; n = 7), middle (33–36 y old; n = 4), and older (59–68 y old; n = 6) subjects. This age-related decrease in brain cellular redox potential is believed to be associated with the bioenergetic failure that underpi[INVESTIGATOR_116269]. NAD+/NADH redox potential is essential for fundamental ATP-energy-generating bioenergetic processes such as glycolysis and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. Proper bioenergetic functioning is required for normal cellular activities including many ‘cellular housekeepi[INVESTIGATOR_007]’ processes such as autophagy, apoptosis and the unfolded protein response (UPR) that have been shown to be abnormal in neurodegenerative diseases (Villanueva-Paz et al. 2016; Chua and Tang 2013; Cantó, Menzies, and Auwerx 2015). Improvement  of brain NAD+/NADH redox potential demonstrated via 31P-MRS will provide Proof of Concept for the ability of CNM-Au8 treatment to potentially treat bioenergetic failure associated with the neurodegeneration observed in patients with Parkinson’s Disease.  4.2 Study Objectives  To assess the CNS metabolic biomarker profile and safety of CNM-Au8 for the treatment of Parkinson’s Disease (PD):  • Metabolic effects will be assessed as an improvement of 31P Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopic (31P-MRS) assessment of brain tissue cellular Redox potential defined by

the measured tissue ratio of NAD+:NADH concentrations and various bioenergetic markers. • Safety will be assessed via adverse events, serious adverse events, discontinuations due to adverse events, and the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS). 4.[ADDRESS_129821] been diagnosed with Parkinson’s Disease (PD) within three (3) years of Screening. Patients will be screened over a 6-week period.  Patients who meet the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be enrolled into the clinical study.   The Sponsor will select a starting treatment dose for the initial treatment cohort of 15 mg or 30 mg CNM-Au8.  Investigators and patients will remain blinded to each cohort’s study dose.  Upon completion of a treatment cohort, the Sponsor will select a single dose or two doses from the prespecified dosing selection plan for the next treatment cohort based on the evaluation of the 31P-MRS changes versus baseline in NAD+/NADH (Figure 13).  Up to a total of two treatment cohorts may be initiated.

The primary efficacy outcome measure will be assessed based upon each patient’s Week [ADDRESS_129822] study visit before exiting the study. All patients will receive once daily oral treatment over twelve (12) consecutive weeks during each cohort Treatment Period. In the event that collection of the 31P-MRS at the Week 12 visit is delayed due to imaging issues or COVID-19 pandemic related concerns, participants may remain on study drug beyond the Week 12 visit, so long as the extension is agreeable to both the study PI [INVESTIGATOR_80336]’s Medical Monitor, until it is deemed safe to return for collection of the Week 12 efficacy assessments. Safety assessments that are able to be captured should be completed every 4 weeks beyond the planned Week 12 visits prior to dispensation of unscheduled study drug. There will be three study periods per treatment cohort: 1. A (6) six-week screening period (Screening Period); 2. A (12) twelve-week treatment period (Treatment Period); 3. A (4) four-week follow-up period (End-of-Study Assessment). The study investigators and patients will remain blinded for the duration of the study.

Clene Nanomedicine, Inc. - Confidential & Proprietary - Page [ADDRESS_129849]-time-in-human study were 15, 30, 60, and 90 mg CNM-Au8. The initial dose level selected was calculated based on the FDA guidance document “Estimating the Maximum Safe Starting Dose in Clinical Trials for Therapeutics in Adult Healthy Volunteers”. The lowest NOAEL was in the rat and was 40 mg/kg. Based on this NOAEL, an equivalent human dose was determined to be approximately 6.4 mg/kg. In a 60-kg human patient, the selected starting dose of 15 mg CNM-Au8 represented a safety margin of approximately 26-fold. The protocol for Study AU8.1000-14-01 was submitted to an Independent Ethics Committee and Competent Authority in the Netherlands and was subsequently approved for initiation under a Clinical Trial Application (CTA). The study was conducted in the Netherlands, at a Phase 1 facility, The Center for Human Drug Research (CHDR) and has been completed. A total of 40 patients were randomized in the SAD phase and 46 patients in the MAD phase. Oral administration of either a single (SAD) or repeated dose (MAD) of CNM-Au8 over 21 consecutive days in healthy volunteers was safe and well tolerated. The TEAEs observed across the 4 doses (15 mg, 30 mg, 60 mg, and 90 mg) of CNM-Au8 were mostly mild in severity. While no dose response relationship to TEAEs was observed overall in the SAD or MAD Phase of the study, increases in headache and gastrointestinal related TEAEs were observed in the 90 mg cohort of the MAD Phase.  No safety trends or safety signals were observed in the study.   In the SAD phase, PK analyses were not completed because the majority of whole blood Au concentrations were below the LOQ.  However, a more sensitive ICP-MS instrument was employed for the MAD phase.  In the MAD Phase:  • The geometric mean whole blood concentrations from [ADDRESS_129850] increased in a dose related, but not a dose-proportional manner. Based on PK results from Days 14 and 21, the increases in both Cmax and AUC(0-24) were less than dose proportional. • Based on pre-specified fit criteria, the elimination t½ ranged from 277 to 628 hr (11.5 to 26.2 days). 
  CNMAu8.202 Protocol (6.0) 09-Sep-2020  
Clene Nanomedicine, Inc. - Confidential & Proprietary - Page 83 of 135  
• Steady-state for all cohorts, based on the geometric mean whole blood concentrations, was reached by [CONTACT_116317] (Day 14), which was substantially less than predicted by [CONTACT_941] t½ [range of 46 to 105 days (6.6 to 15 weeks)]. • PK parameters related to urinary excretion (Ue, CLr) could not be calculated. Only one urine Au concentration ≥ LOQ (3 ng/mL) was within limits of the assay. Based upon the maximum doses (mg/kg/day) evaluated in the nonclinical GLP repeat-dose 21-day toxicokinetic studies, the completed first-time-in-human Phase 1 study (AU8.1000-14-01) doses of 15, 30, 60, 90 mg provided a safety margin to the NOAEL based on dose ratios (mg/m2) ranging from 26x – 4x in rodents, and 195x – 32x in canines, as described in the tables below.  Therefore, at the top dose of 90 mg tested in humans, there was a minimum 4x safety margin to the NOAEL in rats.  Table 16. Summary of CNM-Au8 Conversion of Animal 21-Day Repeat Doses To Human Equivalent Dose (HED) Based On Body Surface Area (mg/m2) for 60 kg Human 
 Further, when evaluating Au exposure based on the end of study Day 21 AUC(0-24) (ng*hr/mL) in the canine, and rodent studies in comparison with the human 21-day MAD study, the human doses provided an exposure safety margin ranging from 3.3x – 1.6x  compared with rodents, and 18.5x – 9.0x compared with canines, as described in Table 17 below.

Table 17. Summary of CNM-Au8 Exposure Safety Margin Based on End of Study AUC(0-24) ng*hr/mL.  Ratio of Animal Toxicokinetic to Human Pharmacokinetic AUC Results From 21-Day Repeat Dose Studies.  
CNM-Au8 exposure at the NOAEL at the end of the chronic toxicokinetic studies in the 9-Month canine and 6-Month rodent chronic dosing studies, provided an exposure safety margin ranging from 6.5x – 3.2x, and 13.6x – 6.7x in rodents and canines, respectively in comparison with the human exposures in the 21-day MAD study, as described below in Table 18. Table 18.  Summary of CNM-Au8 Exposure Safety Margin Based on End of Study AUC(0-24) ng*hr/mL Ratio of Chronic Animal Toxicokinetic 6 and 9-Month Rodent and Canine Repeat Dose Studies to Human 21-Day Pharmacokinetic Results  
 Based on CNM-Au8 exposures at the NOAELs in the chronic rodent and canine studies along with observed CNM-Au8 exposures in 21-day multiple dosing in humans while also considering safety and tolerability, the doses chosen for this Phase 2 study in patients with Parkinson’s Disease will be up to 60 mg. Furthermore, the blood gold exposure observed at this dose in humans, is similar to the exposure observed in rodent toxicokinetic (TK) studies where significant remyelination and neuroprotection benefits were observed in preclinical neuroprotection models at 10 mg/kg, thus suggesting a positive bioenergetic response to CNM-Au8 at this relative dose (e.g. 15 – 60 mg).

In vivo 31P Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) measures phosphorus-containing metabolites such as NADH and ATP that are key molecules in cellular bioenergetic processes. By [CONTACT_116336]+/NADH and ATP, neuronal redox potential can be assessed and the effects of CNM-Au8 on redox homeostasis can be studied. Patients will have two 31P-MRS studies: at Baseline (Visit 0) and at Week 12 (Visit 4).  9.2.3 Imaging Procedures MRI/MRS scans will be conducted on a Philips Achieva [ADDRESS_129858] anxiolytic dose will be administered to ameliorate procedure related anxiety. The patient will remain under medical supervision until deemed safe for discharge by [CONTACT_737]. [IP_ADDRESS] Whole Brain Metabolite Measurements:  Preparation: A cylinder bird-cage shaped 31P T/R volume coil insert (into a 1H T/R volume coil) will be used for imaging the brain stem. The head of the patient will be positioned in the center of the coil with soft cushion pads placed under and on the sides of the head to secure the positioning of the head and reduce potential movement during the scans.  After a scout image scan, axial, sagittal and coronal T2-weighted spin-echo multi-slice brain images will be collected using the typi[INVESTIGATOR_116246]: TR 3.5 sec, TE 80 ms, slice thickness 8 mm, gap 2 mm. A 2nd-order volume-based shimming will be conducted prior to 31P MRS data acquisition. 31P MRS scans: Whole brain 31P spectra will be acquired using three-dimensional chemical shift imaging (3D CSI) approach.  Typi[INVESTIGATOR_116247] = 0.5 sec, NP 2 k, BW 8 kHz, NA = 4 (short scan) and 16 (long scan), with spatial resolution of 2x2x2 cm3. If subjects are able to complete both short and long scans without movement artifact, the data will be combined. Otherwise, only the completed dataset without movement artefacts will be used for data analysis. Voxel-based 31P spectra will be pooled together based on the functional regions (frontal, temporal, parietal and occipi[INVESTIGATOR_307]) to evaluate the spatial distributions of metabolites.  Data

analysis will be performed by [CONTACT_116289] 31P resonances of all phosphorous metabolites using a previously developed Matlab program.   [IP_ADDRESS] Partial Volume Coil Measurement: Preparation: A half-cylinder-shaped 1H/31P dual-tuned T/R partial volume coil will be used to image the posterior brain (occipi[INVESTIGATOR_116248]) for evaluation of the brain redox state based on the measurement of NAD+/NADH ratio.  Axial, sagittal and coronal T2-weighted spin-echo multi-slice images will be collected from the posterior head using the typi[INVESTIGATOR_116249] 3.5 sec and TE 80 ms, slice thickness 8 mm, gap 2 mm. A 2nd-order volume-based shimming will be conducted over the posterior brain region prior to 31P MRS data acquisition. 31P MRS scans: To obtain 31P spectra with resolved NAD from overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a-ATP signals, an inversion-recovery-based NAD spectral editing technique will be used.  Briefly, acquisition of a reference 31P spectrum using pulse-acquire sequence is conducted plus the acquisition of an additional spectrum using a sequence containing an adiabatic inversion pre-pulse followed by a short delay is done to selectively nullify the NAD signal. A spectral subtraction will be performed to obtain an NAD-edited spectrum with resolved NAD signal from the reference spectrum.  The contribution of NAD+ and NADH to the resolved NAD signal will be quantified by [CONTACT_116290] a singlet and the NAD+ signal being a quartet (as defined by 31P coupled AB-spin system resonance pattern). The brain redox state will be calculated by [CONTACT_116291]+/NADH ratio. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_2855] 31P MRS parameters for data acquisition will be TR 1.0 sec, TD 0.17 ms, NP 4k and zero filled to 8k, BW 8 kHz, NA 512x2. For quantitative comparison of different metabolites in the posterior brain region, an additional scan will be performed, using the partial volume coil, under the fully relaxed T1 condition with long TR of 15 sec and 16 acquisition averages. 9.2.4 APDM Gait and Postural Analysis Gait abnormalities and postural instability are features of PD that worsen with disease severity and can both be used as indicators of fall risk. Gait abnormalities and postural instability will be assessed using the APDM Mobility Lab and wearable Opal sensors. 
  CNMAu8.202 Protocol (6.0) 09-Sep-2020  
Clene Nanomedicine, Inc. - Confidential & Proprietary - Page 98 of 135  
Measurements of gait abnormality will be collected by [CONTACT_116337]. A Timed Up and Go (TUG) test will be performed, which involves standing from a seated position, walking six meters, turning 180°, walking back to the chair and sitting. The time it takes to complete this action will be recorded, and the wearable Opal sensors will provide multiple measures pertaining to gait analysis (e.g., lean angle, duration, velocity, steps, speed, etc.).  Gait abnormality will also be measured by [CONTACT_116338] 2-Minute Walk test, which involves walking back and forth on a 7-meter course for a period of two minutes. Multiple variables will be measured by [CONTACT_116339], and the distance walked recorded.  Measurements of postural instability will be collected by [CONTACT_116340] a period of time while the wearable sensors measure parameters such as mean sway area, path length, jerk, and sway distance in the mediolateral and anteroposterior directions. This assessment will be conducted while the subject remains standing with their eyes open, and repeated standing with their eyes closed, both when standing on a firm surface (e.g., a laminate floor).  Both the TUG, Postural Sway and 2-Minute Walk assessments will be conducted at the Baseline and Week 12 Visits.  9.2.5 Assessment of Safety Safety assessments will include the following: • Treatment emergent AEs and SAEs, both reported and observed • Physical examination • Vital sign measurements: Ear temperature, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], blood pressure, and heart rate (blood pressure and heart rate will be measured after the patient has been supi[INVESTIGATOR_2525] 5 minutes) • 12-Lead ECG will be conducted in triplicate at the Baseline Visit and averaged. A single ECG collection will occur at each additional scheduled time point • Venous blood for clinical laboratory tests will include hematology, coagulation, and blood chemistry. Blood for analysis will be drawn after an overnight fast when possible • C-SSRS

Following sterile collection, the CSF sample should immediately be transported to the laboratory and processed per the study’s Lab Manual. CSF sampling should occur after the subject has performed all other assessments associated with the visit.   Pharmacokinetic analyses, and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) modeling as applicable, using population approaches to describe Au whole blood pharmacokinetics including potential influence of relevant patient co-variables (e.g. age, gender, body weight, etc.) or potentially to relate parameters of clinical safety and efficacy response with Au whole blood concentrations will be investigated under separate detailed PK and/or PD evaluation plan(s). [IP_ADDRESS] Collecting, Processing, and Shippi[INVESTIGATOR_116279], 4 mL of whole blood will be collected for each blood draw for bioanalytical analyses of Au content.  Blood samples for PK analyses will be collected in tubes with dipotassium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (K2EDTA), which should not exceed 1.6 mg K2EDTA per mL of whole blood).  PK samples must be placed on wet crushed ice immediately and stored at -70 °C or lower within 15 minutes.  For PD analyses, up to an additional 20 mL of whole blood will be collected following the collection of the PK in two divided samples.  PD samples will be collected in citric acid tubes, placed on wet crushed ice immediately, and stored at -70 °C or lower, as quickly as feasible.  Additional processes surrounding collection, processing and shipment of collected samples will be defined in the study’s Lab Manual.  [IP_ADDRESS] Bioanalytical Methods Blood concentrations of gold (Au) will be determined by [CONTACT_116342] (ICP-MS) analytical methods.

prescription, will be excluded from the study. Urine Drug Screen kits will be supplied for sites to complete testing onsite.  Repeat urine drug screens for validation of initial findings may be conducted at the discretion of the site investigator. The core clinical laboratory will supply appropriate blood collection tubes for each study visit as specified in the study’s Lab Manual.   9.2.[ADDRESS_129863] of assessments of the following: skin, ears, nose, throat, head, eyes, lungs/chest, heart, abdomen, musculoskeletal, extremities, neurologic.  9.2.11 Vital Signs Vital signs will include respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487] (breaths per minute), temperature, blood pressure (mmHg) and heart rate (beats per minute [bpm]). Blood pressure and heart rate will be obtained after the patient has been resting in supi[INVESTIGATOR_19636] [ADDRESS_129864] always be used for blood pressure and heart rate measurements. Noninvasive measurement should be conducted preferably with a mercury sphygmomanometer or a validated electronic device in accordance with published guidelines (e.g. American Heart Association: Recommendations for Blood Pressure Measurement in Humans and Experimental Animals) (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_116281]., 2005).  9.2.[ADDRESS_129865] 5 minutes in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_116282].   The average corrected QT interval (QTc) of the triplicate ECG measurements collected prior to Day 1 dosing will serve as that patient’s baseline for use in ongoing safety assessment.  At all other scheduled timepoints, a single ECG will be collected after the patient has rested quietly for at least 5 minutes in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547]. When the timing of the measurement coincides with a blood collection, the ECG should be obtained prior to blood collection.  In some cases, it may be appropriate to repeat abnormal ECGs to rule out improper lead placement as contributing to the ECG abnormality. It is important that leads are placed in the same positions each time for consistency. 
  CNMAu8.202 Protocol (6.0) 09-Sep-2020

ECG intervals will be summarized and presented descriptively. ECG rhythm will be interpreted by [CONTACT_116296] (N), abnormal not-clinically significant (aNCS), or abnormal clinically significant (aCS). 9.2.13 Assessment Windows The MRS scan should occur as close to the same time per patient for the Baseline and Week 12 Visit, within a +/- 2 hours window. Collection of blood samples should occur as close to the nominal timepoint as possible. The actual collection time of blood samples will be recorded.

10 ADVERSE EVENTS Safety will be assessed via adverse events, serious adverse events, discontinuations due to adverse events, and changes in the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS). 10.1 Safety Reporting Guidelines AE monitoring and reporting is a routine part of every clinical study.  All Investigators, clinical site staff, and the Sponsor’s employees share in the responsibility for reporting AEs and SAEs. 10.1.1 Sponsor Guidance The Sponsor is required to notify all participating Investigators and FDA in a written Investigational New Drug (IND) safety report of any AE associated with the use of the investigational drug that is both serious and unexpected, and any finding from tests in laboratory animals that suggests a significant risk for human patients (21 CFR 312.32(c)(1)(i)(A),(B)).  The Sponsor is required to keep Investigators informed of new observations discovered by, or reported to the Sponsor regarding the study drug particularly with respect to AEs and safe use (21 CFR 312.55). 10.1.[ADDRESS_129866] immediately to the Sponsor (21 CFR 312.64). Further, Investigators are required to promptly report to the Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC) and/or Institutional Review Board (IRB) as applicable all unanticipated problems involving risks to human patients or others including AEs that should be considered unanticipated problems (21 CFR 56.108(B)(1), 21 CFR 312.53(c)(1)(vii), and 21 CFR 312.66). All Investigators and clinical site staff who learn about or are notified of a SAE must collect and promptly report to the Sponsor (within 24 hours) data according to the study protocol and relevant regulations (21 CFR 312.64, 21 CFR 312. 32).

10.2 Adverse Events (AE or Adverse Experience) Adverse events include any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related. Therefore, an AE can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of the investigational drug, whether or not considered related to the study drug (attribution of ‘unrelated’, ‘unlikely’, ‘possible’, ‘probable’, or ‘definite’) (International Conference on Harmonization [ICH] E2A, E6).  Adverse events include: • Exacerbation of a pre-existing disease. • Increase in frequency or intensity of a pre-existing epi[INVESTIGATOR_110150]. • Disease or medical condition detected or diagnosed after study drug administration even though it may have been present prior to the start of the study. • Continuous persistent disease or symptoms present at Baseline that worsen following the start of the study. • Lack of efficacy in the acute treatment of a life-threatening disease. • Events considered by [CONTACT_116344]-mandated procedures. • Abnormal assessments (e.g., change on physical examination, ECG findings), if they represent a clinically significant finding that were not present at Baseline or worsened during the course of the study. • Laboratory test abnormalities if they represent a clinically significant finding, symptomatic or not, which was not present at Baseline or worsened during the course of the study or led to dose reduction, interruption, or permanent discontinuation of the study drug. Adverse events do not include: • Medical or surgical procedure not mandated in the protocol (e.g., surgery, endoscopy, tooth extraction).  However, the event leading to the procedure is an AE. If this event is serious, the procedure must be described in the SAE narrative on the SAE eCRF. • Pre-existing disease or medical condition that does not worsen. However, if the condition deteriorates at any time during the study, it should be recorded as an AE. 
  CNMAu8.202 Protocol (6.0) 09-Sep-2020  
Clene Nanomedicine, Inc. - Confidential & Proprietary - Page 107 of 135  
• Situations in which an adverse change did not occur (e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_116283]/or convenience reasons). • Overdose of either study drug without any signs or symptoms. However, overdose of study drug must be reported in the Study Drug Log. The occurrence of an AE may come to the attention of study personnel during the study visits, during interviews of a study recipi[INVESTIGATOR_12189], or upon review by a study monitor. Information to be collected and recorded include: event description, time of onset, clinician’s assessment of severity, relationship to study product (assessed only by [CONTACT_8703] a diagnosis, which would include MD, PA, Nurse Practitioner, DO, or Physician Assistant), and time of resolution/stabilization of the event. All AEs occurring during the study including local and systemic reactions must be documented appropriately regardless of relationship and recorded on the relevant eCRF.  If there is any doubt as to whether a clinical observation is an AE, the event should be reported. 10.2.1 Intensity of Adverse Events The intensity of all AEs will be graded for severity.  The investigating clinician will assess all AEs by [CONTACT_116345] a three-point scale of 1) mild, 2) moderate, and 3) severe; which are defined as follows: • Mild events: require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the patient’s daily activities. • Moderate events:  result in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the investigational drug. Moderate events may cause some interference with daily functioning. • Severe events: interrupt a patient’s usual daily activity and may require systemic drug therapy or other treatment. Severe events are usually incapacitating. If the intensity of an AE worsens during study drug administration, only the worst intensity should be reported on the relevant AE eCRF. If the AE lessens in intensity, no change in the severity is required.  AEs characterized as intermittent require documentation of onset and duration of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]. 
  CNMAu8.202 Protocol (6.0) 09-Sep-2020  
Clene Nanomedicine, Inc. - Confidential & Proprietary - Page [ADDRESS_129867] abnormalities or abnormal assessments (e.g., ECG findings) considered as AEs. The Investigator should tick “non-applicable” on the AE page of the eCRF when identifying the intensity of the AE. Of note, mild, moderate, or severe AE classifications may or may not be serious (see SAE section).  These terms are used to describe the intensity of a specific adverse event (as in mild, moderate, or severe nausea). For example, nausea lasting several hours may be rated as severe, but may not be clinically serious.  Alternatively, a fever of 39°C that is not considered severe, may however become serious, if it prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  Seriousness rather than severity serves as a guide for defining regulatory reporting requirements. 10.2.2 Relationship and Attribution of the AE to Study Drug [IP_ADDRESS] Relationship to Study Drug Each adverse event must be assessed by [CONTACT_116346] a reasonable possibility of causal relationship to the study drug, and reported as either related or unrelated. The Investigators assessment of an AE's relationship to the study drug is part of the documentation process, but it is not a factor in determining what is or is not reported in the study.  • Related to Study Drug:  This category applies to any AE (whether serious or not) that appears to have a reasonable possibility of causal relationship to the use of the study drug (i.e., a relationship cannot be ruled out). Guidelines to determine whether an event might be considered related include but are not limited to the following: o The event occurred in close temporal relationship to study drug administration. o The event diminished or disappeared when treatment with the study drug was down titrated, interrupted, or discontinued. o The event reoccurred when treatment was reintroduced. o Environmental factors such as clinical state and other treatments could not equally have caused the event. • Unrelated to Study:  There is not a reasonable possibility that the administration of the study product caused the event (see above guidelines). 
  CNMAu8.202 Protocol (6.0) 09-Sep-2020  
Clene Nanomedicine, Inc. - Confidential & Proprietary - Page 109 of 135  
[IP_ADDRESS] Attribution to The Study Drug After identifying and grading the event, the clinical Investigator must assign an attribution to the AE using the following attribution categories described in the table below. AEs listed as ‘possibly, probably’ or definitely’ related to the investigational drug are considered to have a suspected ‘reasonable causal relationship’ to the investigational agent (ICH E2A). Table 19.  AE Attribution to the Study Drug Relationship to Study Drug  Attribution  Description Unrelated Unrelated The AE is clearly NOT related to the study drug Unlikely The AE is doubtfully related to the study drug Related Possible The AE may be related to the study drug Probable The AE is likely related to the study drug Definite The AE is clearly related to the study drug  10.2.3 Serious Adverse Events The International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) guidelines define a serious adverse event (SAE) as an AE or suspected adverse reaction that in the view of either the Investigator or Sponsor results in any of the following study patient outcomes: • Death, • A life-threatening AE, • Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], • A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, • A congenital anomaly/birth defect, or • An important medical event, requiring medical or surgical intervention (treatment) to prevent at least one of the outcomes listed above. 
  CNMAu8.202 Protocol (6.0) 09-Sep-2020  
Clene Nanomedicine, Inc. - Confidential & Proprietary - Page [ADDRESS_129868] caused death had it been more severe. Important medical events that do not result in death, are not life threatening, or do not require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12190], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the SAE definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, a blood dyscrasia or convulsion that does not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. Complications that occur during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_116284] (i.e., if a complication prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_116285]). However, the following reasons for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_110152], and are therefore also not SAEs: • Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_78429], or social and/or convenience reasons. • Standard monitoring of a pre-existing disease or medical condition that did not worsen (e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_42865] a patient with stable angina pectoris). • Elective treatment of a pre-existing disease or medical condition that did not worsen (e.g., elective hip replacement for arthritis). 10.2.[ADDRESS_129869] a reasonable possibility of a causal relationship (i.e., a relationship cannot be ruled out) to procedures other than administration of the study drug. Examples of study-mandated procedures include blood sampling, car accident on the way to the study unit for a study visit, etc. 
  CNMAu8.202 Protocol (6.0) 09-Sep-2020  
Clene Nanomedicine, Inc. - Confidential & Proprietary - Page [ADDRESS_129870] be reported on the appropriate AE eCRF. 10.3.3  Reporting of AE Intensity and Causality Only licensed study clinicians (i.e., Medical Doctor, Doctor of Osteopathy, Nurse Practitioner, Physician’s Assistant) should assess the intensity of non-serious AEs. Similarly, only licensed study clinicians as identified on Form FDA 1572 or per ICH E6 standards should assess the causality of AEs. 10.3.4  Follow-up of AEs All AEs occurring during the AE reporting period of the study will be documented appropriately regardless of relationship. All AEs occurring during the treatment period will be followed to adequate resolution or until the patient is considered stable. Adverse events still ongoing after study drug discontinuation for a given patient will be followed until 28 days after study drug discontinuation or until AE resolution or patient stabilization. 
  CNMAu8.202 Protocol (6.0) 09-Sep-2020

Resolution of an AE is defined as the return to pretreatment status or stabilization of the condition to the Investigator and/or Sponsor’s satisfaction with the expectation that the condition or abnormality may remain chronic. Follow-up procedures, evaluations, and outcomes will be recorded on the patient's CRF. 10.3.5 Reporting Requirements For SAEs All SAEs occurring during the course of the study (e.g., signing of informed consent by [CONTACT_116347] [ADDRESS_129871] dose of the study drug) and any SAEs, considered causally related to study drug that occur following completion of the study, must be reported to the Sponsor. [IP_ADDRESS]  Reporting of SAEs All serious adverse events that occur during the course of study will be recorded on the appropriate eCRF (e.g., SAE eCRF) and will be reported to Sponsor’s drug safety physician. Any AE that meets a protocol-defined criterion as serious must be submitted immediately (within 24 hours of site or Investigator awareness) on an SAE form to the Sponsor’s drug safety physician at the following address: Robert Glanzman, MD, FAAN Sponsor’s Medical Monitor Clene Nanomedicine, Inc. [ADDRESS_129872] Salt Lake City, Utah [ZIP_CODE] [LOCATION_002] Tel: +[PHONE_2654] Email: [EMAIL_2309]   Information to be collected includes unique patient ID, event description, date of onset, Investigator assessment of severity, Investigator assessment of relationship to study product, date of resolution of the event, seriousness, and outcome. Other supporting documentation of the event may be requested by [CONTACT_116348]. The Sponsor’s drug safety physician will review and assess the SAE for regulatory reporting and potential impact on study patient safety and protocol conduct.

Clene Nanomedicine, Inc. - Confidential & Proprietary - Page 113 of 135  
[IP_ADDRESS]  SAE Reporting Periods • Screening period: SAEs occurring between signing the Informed Consent Form and study drug initiation should be reported in the eCRF.  • Treatment Period: All SAEs, regardless of causal relationship, must be reported, including those related to study-mandated procedures. Those SAEs occurring during study drug administration, i.e., between study drug initiation and [ADDRESS_129873] be reconciled before study closure. • Follow-Up Period: All SAEs, regardless of causal relationship, occurring after study drug discontinuation until [ADDRESS_129874] be reported. • Post Follow-Up Period: If the Investigator becomes aware of a new SAE that is suspected of being causally related to the study drug occurring after [ADDRESS_129875]-study completion, the Investigator will report the event within 24 hours to the Sponsor’s drug safety physician. These SAEs are only entered in the drug safety database, and therefore will not affect study closure. [IP_ADDRESS]  SAE Reporting Procedures • All SAEs must be reported by [CONTACT_116349] 24 hours of the Investigator’s first knowledge of the event. • All SAEs must be recorded on the appropriate SAE forms, irrespective of the study drug received by [CONTACT_102], and whether this event is considered by [CONTACT_66325]. These SAE forms must be faxed and emailed to the Clene Nanomedicine, Inc. drug safety physician. • The Investigator must complete the SAE form in English (unless otherwise specified), and must assess the relationship of the event to study drug.  Such reports will be followed 
  CNMAu8.202 Protocol (6.0) 09-Sep-2020  
Clene Nanomedicine, Inc. - Confidential & Proprietary - Page 114 of 135  
by [CONTACT_116350][INVESTIGATOR_3103], autopsy reports, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_110160]. • Follow-up information about a previously reported SAE must also be reported within [ADDRESS_129876] the Investigator to obtain further information. • The intensity of SAEs may only be assessed by a licensed study physician as described previously.  The causality of SAEs may only be assessed by a licensed physician identified on the Form FDA 1572 or per ICH E6 standards. [IP_ADDRESS]  SAE Regulatory Reporting Following notification from the Investigator, the Sponsor will expedite reporting any suspected adverse reaction that is both serious and unexpected to Health Authorities, HREC, IRBs, and other Investigators, as appropriate. The Sponsor will report an AE as a suspected adverse reaction only if there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the AE. Sponsor will notify FDA and all participating Investigators (i.e., all Investigators to whom the Sponsor is providing drug under its INDs or under any Investigator’s IND) in an IND safety report of potential serious risks from clinical trials or any other source, as soon as possible, but in no case later than 15 calendar days after the Sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting as specified in 21 CFR Part 312.32.  Further, Sponsor will notify FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction as soon as possible but in no case later than 7 calendar days after the Sponsor’s initial receipt of the information. Relevant follow-up information to an IND safety report will be submitted as soon as the information is available. Upon request from FDA, Sponsor will submit to FDA any additional data or information that the agency deems necessary, as soon as possible, but in no case later than [ADDRESS_129877]. Un-blinding of serious and unexpected AEs will be performed as necessary and appropriate. All serious adverse events designated as “not related” to study product(s), will be reported to the FDA at least annually in a summary format.

11.4 Prior and Concomitant Medications Medications taken after the patient receives study drug through Follow-Up will be listed by [CONTACT_3148], dose level and patient. 11.5 Pharmacokinetic Analyses Pharmacokinetic parameters will be derived using noncompartmental analyses employing appropriate software and graphing tools (e.g. WinNonlin® Professional version 6.3 [Pharsight Corp], SAS® for Windows® Version 9.4, SigmaPlot for Windows Version 12.5; or higher versions).  Au concentrations will be summarized using descriptive statistics (including N, mean, SD, coefficient of variation (CV%), median, minimum, and maximum) for each treatment. Concentrations below the limit of quantification (BLQ) will be treated as zero for the computation of descriptive statistics and for construction of mean concentration-time profiles. Concentrations assigned a value of missing will be omitted from the calculation of descriptive statistics. The following PK parameters will be estimated by [CONTACT_116352]. Actual elapsed time from dosing will be used to estimate all individual PK parameters. Table 21.  Summary of PK Parameters  Parameter Description Cmax Maximum observed plasma concentration Tmax Time of maximum concentration (h), obtained directly from the observed concentration versus time data. CL/F Apparent systemic clearance AUC(0-24) Area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 to the end of the 24-hour dosing interval  Derived PK descriptive statistics will be tabulated by [CONTACT_116353].   Descriptive statistics for PK parameters will include the arithmetic and geometric mean (for Cmax, Tmax, AUC(0-24), and CL/F), CV%, SD of the arithmetic mean, median, minimum, maximum, and N.

Population PK and PK/PD models may be developed to address objectives that require an integrative interpretation of the study results. These include assessment of the dose proportionality, investigation of the nature of the PK/PD relationship, and the use of study results as part of a larger model-based data analysis. If population PK/PD models are developed, a separate Pharmacometric Analysis Plan will be written. 11.6 Safety Analyses All safety summaries will be descriptive; no statistical significance tests will be performed on safety data and will be based on the safety population. Safety assessments include extent of exposure, incidence of treatment-emergent AEs, drug-related AEs, deaths, SAEs, AEs leading to discontinuation from the study and changes in the C-SSRS.  Changes from baseline in clinical laboratory results, ECGs and vital signs will also be summarized by [CONTACT_11571].    At each time point, absolute values and change from baseline of each safety endpoint will be summarized with n, mean, SD, standard error of the mean (SEM), median, Min, and Max values. The number of available observations and out-of-range values (absolute and in percentage) will be presented. Values outside the reference range will be flagged in the listing. ‘H’ and ‘L’, denoting values above or below the Investigator reference range (when present), will flag out-of-range results. The AE coding dictionary for this study will be Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). It will be used to summarize AEs by [CONTACT_92869] (SOC) and preferred term (PT). 11.7 Efficacy Analyses 11.7.1 Primary Efficacy Endpoint The primary efficacy endpoint is the mean change in NAD Redox Ratio measured by 31P-MRS from Baseline to Week 12.

For primary and exploratory endpoints, the statistical significance comparing the result of each CNM-Au8 treatment versus baseline, will be reported. Statistical significance will be determined by [CONTACT_1192]-sided paired t-tests assessed at the p ≤ 0.05 significance level.  Instrumented APDM tests will be performed at the Baseline and Week 12 study visits to determine the change from Baseline.  All analyses will be specified in the Statistical Analyses Plan. The Cohort 2 sample size may be re-calculated based on the mean change from baseline in NAD+/NADH Redox Ratio to Week [ADDRESS_129882] procedures.  Primary, and exploratory efficacy analyses will be based on the intent to treat (ITT) population.  Changes in primary and secondary efficacy parameters (e.g., 31P-MRS Redox Ratio [NAD+/NADH ratio], bioenergetic metabolites) will also be compared to historical age-matched healthy controls. 11.8 Interim analyses Cohort 1 data will be analyzed prior to initiation of Cohort 2.  No other pre-specified interim analyses are planned per protocol. 11.9 Data Handling and Quality Assurance 11.9.1 Data Recording Limited data may be entered solely into the eCRF (e.g., ethnic group). All other data must have source documentation available. A source document checklist will be used at the site to identify the source data for all data points collected, and the study monitor will work with the site to complete the source documentation verification.  11.9.2  Data Recorded From Screening Failures For patients who do not meet selection criteria (Screen Failures), source data will be recorded and entered into the eCRF, including the reason for the screen failure, and demographic information (e.g., patient number, date of birth/age, sex, height, weight, race and ethnicity), and the date of the study visit.

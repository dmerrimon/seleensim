diagnosis of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis with: 
Cohort 1 -10 -20 patients age 12-17 years of age with 10-30% body surface area (BSA) 
affected 
Cohort 2-5-10 patients age 6-11 years of age with 10-30% body surface area (BSA) 
affected 
Cohort 3-5-10 patients age 2-5 years of age with 10-30% body surface area (BSA) affected 
Cohort 4-5-10patients 6 months to 1 year of age with 10-30% body surface area (BSA) 
affected 
Cohorts will be enrolled in sequential order. Each cohort will initiate enrollment once the 
previous cohort has reached the minimum number of patients and a safety analysis has been 
reviewed. Each cohort will be enrolled based on the availability of patients. 
Each cohort will be reviewed for the potential ofHPA axis suppression. If at least 50% of 
patients in a Cohort experience HPA axis suppression, enrollment for that cohort will be stopped 
and no further cohorts will be initiated. If at least 35% of patients have experienced HPA axis 
suppression across all cohorts combined during the study, enrollment will be discontinued and no 
other cohorts will be initiated. Cohort [ADDRESS_130850] twice a day, according to provided instructions, 
for a total of 28 days. 
Patients will attend a total of 3 Clinic Visits as follows: 
• Visit 1 (Day 1): Screening/Enrollment 
• Visit 2 (Day 14±2): Interim Visit 
• Visit 3 (Day 29±2): End of Study or Early Termination

4. RANDOMIZATION AND BLINDING 
Patients eligible for enrollment into the study will fall into one of four cohorts: 
Cohort 1-10-20 patients age 12-17 years of age with 10-30% body surface area (BSA) 
affected 
Cohort 2-5-10 patients age 6-11 years of age with 10-30% body surface area (BSA) 
affected 
Cohort 3 -5-10 patients age 2-5 years of age with 10-30% body surface area (BSA) affected 
Cohort 4-5-10 patients 6 months -1 year of age with 10-30% body surface area (BSA) 
affected 
At Visit [ADDRESS_130852] 50% of 
patients in each Cohort experience HPA axis suppression, enrollment for that cohort will be 
stopped and no further cohorts will be initiated. If at least 35% of patients have experienced 
HPA axis suppression across cohorts combined during the study, enrollment will be discontinued 
and no other cohorts will be initiated. Cohort 2 will not begin until safety data has been 
reviewed for Cohort 1. The same process will be followed for each Cohort until the study is 
complete. 
The enrollment in the individual Cohort may not be required ifthe satisfactory safety data for the 
same age group was obtained in the study DSXS 1502.

10. APPENDICES 
APPENDIX A: Body Surface Area Calculation 
Total Body Surface Area Calculation 
To calculate the Total BSA the following procedure (Mosteller Formula13) should be followed. 
Total Body Surface Area (BSA) in meters squared 
m2 =((height (em) x weight (kg)) [ZIP_CODE])12 
It is preferable that the patient's height and weight be 
measured in em and kg however if needed: 
To convert inches (in) to centimeters (em) the following 
conversion should be used 
1 inch = 2.54 em 
To convert pounds (lbs) to kilograms (kg) the following 
conversion should be used 
lib= 0.45 kg 
The patient's height and weight should be reported to the nearest em and nearest 0.[ADDRESS_130864] a reported BSA of: 
68 in x 2.54 = 173 em 
180 lb X 0.45 = 81.0 kg 
BSA = SQRT ((173 x 81.0)[ZIP_CODE]) 
= 1.97 m2 
%BSA Affected 
To estimate the % BSA Affected, the Investigator should use the method of approximation: 
The "Rule ofNines" provides a general estimation oftotal BSA for several anatomic 
areas (each arm = 9%, each leg = 18%, back = 18%, chest and abdomen = 18%, head =

Desoximetasone 0.15% Topi[INVESTIGATOR_117289] I Study No. DSXS 1502a I 71615002 
9%, groin= 1%). The Investigator may then visually estimate the proportion ofthe 
involved skin within each anatomic area and calculate the total percentage ofBSA 
affected. In children, hips and legs are smaller and the head, neck and shoulders are 
larger, as a result, a modified "Rule of Nines" is used (see diagram below).

APPENDIX B: Eczema Area and Severity Index Score (EASI) 
The EASI is a composite score based on the severity of four different signs of atopic dermatitis in 
four different areas ofthe body multiplied by [CONTACT_117320] a weighting factor. 
Erythema 
0 =Clear 
1 =Mild 
2 =Moderate 
3 =Severe No evidence of erythema 
Definite light red coloration 
Moderate redness, but not dark 
Dark red coloration 
Induration/papulation/edema 
0 = Clear No evidence of any induration/papulation/edema 
1 = Mild Barely perceptible elevation 
2 = Moderate Clearly perceptible elevation 
3 = Severe Marked and extensive elevation 
Lichenification 
0 =Clear 
1 =Mild 
2 =Moderate 
3 =Severe 
Excoriation 
0 =Clear 
1 =Mild 
2 =Moderate 
3 =Severe No evidence of lichenification 
Slight thickening of skin discerible only by [CONTACT_117321] a visible criss-cross or ridged pattern 
Thickened skin with skin markings visibly portraying an 
exaggerated criss-cross or ridged pattern 
No evidence of excoriation 
Scant evidence of excoriation with no signs of deepers skin 
damage (absence of erosion or crusts) 
Several linear marks of skin with some showing evidence of 
deeper skin injury (erosion, crust visible) 
Many erosive or crusty lesions present 
The patient will be required to rate the severity of their pruritis (itching/scratching/discomfort) over 
the previous 24 hours using the following scale: 
Pruritis 
0 =None 
1 =Mild 
2 =Moderate 
[ZIP_CODE]/2017 None 
Occasional slight itching or scratching 
Constant or intermittent itching/scratching/discomfort which 
is not disturbing sleep

Desoximetasone 0.15% Topi[INVESTIGATOR_117289] I Study No. DSXS 1502a I 71615002 
3 =Severe Bothersome itching/scratching/discomfort which is 
disturbing sleep 
Eczema, induration, excoriation and lichenification are part of the EASI score but pruritis is not. 
EASI Score 
The EASI score is calculated as follows: 
Head/neck (E + I + X + L) x Area x 0.1 (in children ages 0-7, x 0.2) 
Upper Limbs (E +I+ X+ L) x Area x 0.2 
Trunk (E +I+ X+ L) x Area x 0.3 
Lower Limbs (E +I+ X+ L) x Area x 0.4 (in children ages 0-7, x 0.3) 
EASI SCORE= SUM OF ABOVE 4 REGIONS 
E: Erythema, 
I: Induration/papulation/edema 
X: Excoriation 
L: Lichenification 
Severity is based on the Investigator's assessment of individual signs and symptoms 
0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe using the definitions above 
The %of each body region affected is scored as the variable Area above in the 
EASI formula. For the 4 body regions (head/neck, upper limbs, trunk and lower 
limbs) ifthe: 
Area= 0 
Area= 1 
Area= 2 
Area= 3 
Area= 4 
Area= 5 
Area= 6 if% affected is 0% 
if% affected is 1 to 9% 
if% affected is 10 to 29% 
if% affected is 30 to 49% 
if% affected is 50 to 69% 
if% affected is 70 to 89% 
if% affected is 90 to 1 00% 
EASI Score can be presented to the nearest whole number (no decimals and all numbers should be 
rounded, 0.[ADDRESS_130865] whole number) 
The minimum score would be [ADDRESS_130866] 15 at baseline.

APPENDIX D: Cortisol Response Test 
This cortisol release test is modified from the procedure of Wood et a! as described in the 
Product Label for Cortrosyn™ (cosyntropin) for injection (Amphstar Pharmaceuticals, Inc.). 
The procedure is as follows: 
1. A single 5 ml blood sample should be taken as the basal sample. 
2. 0.25 mg (a single vial) of Cortrosyn ™ (cosyntropin) should be reconstituted with l.Oml 
of0.9% sodium chloride injection USP injected intramuscularly. In patients under 3 years 
of age, 0.125mg of Cortrosyn ™ will be used. 
3. 30 minutes after the IM injection a second 5 ml blood sample should be obtained. The 
resulting two serum samples (at least 1 ml of serum in each) should be processed and 
labeled according to the instructions provided and sent the same day to ACM Global 
Laboratory for analysis of basal and post stimulated serum cortisol concentration. 
At Visit [ADDRESS_130869] be obtained prior to study drug being dispensed at 
Visit 2. Only patients with normal baseline (Visit I) cortisol and adrenal function (see criteria 
below) should be enrolled in the study. 
Visit [ADDRESS_130870] normal basal cortisol level and adrenal function if they meet 
all three criteria listed below under Normal. Failure to meet any of these criteria is indicative of 
abnormal adrenal function or potential HP A axis suppression.

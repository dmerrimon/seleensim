to examine task effects, task -specific TMS augmentation effects and task - 
specific  augmentation of TMS  neuromodulation.  
 
Primary outcome variable(s)  
We will determine both an “intensity (difficulty) effect” and an “emotion effect” 
of task -induced fMRI activity in the scanner, collecting these measures in the 
same subjects. Participants will receive two working memory tasks:  
1a) Sternberg  Sorting  Task  (SST):  a cognitive  task comparing low-load 
vs. high- load conditions in which the pi[INVESTIGATOR_183659].  
1b) International Affective Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2980] (IAPS): an emotional task 
using IAPS pi[INVESTIGATOR_183660]. 
The number of images will vary by [CONTACT_183675], but for both the high- load & 
low-load conditions, participants will look at IAPS pi[INVESTIGATOR_183661]. Further, ji ttered within this design will be both 
neutral and negative blocks of IAPS pi[INVESTIGATOR_499].  
 
Secondary outcome variable(s)  
 
Aim 2: to determine which task provides greater augmentation of the TMS - 
induced DLPFC activation, participants will receive in randomized order:  
1) The cognitive SST working memory task or the IAPS task  alone  
2) rTMS + the cognitive SST working memory task or rTMS + the 
IAPS emotional task in randomized order. rTMS and the cognitive 
tasks  will be conducted in the fMRI  scanner  where  brain  activation 
to a TMS probe and connectivity will be obtained.  
3) rTMS  alone  
 
Aim 3 : to determine the effect of neuromodulation on DLPFC activation 
healthy participants will be randomized to one of the 3 task conditions: high - 
load cognitive SST, high- load IAPS task, or low -load SST (sham task 
condition). Following a 4 session course ([ADDRESS_216863] 4 hours on a 
second day) of either active rTMS or sham TMS neuromodulation in 
combi nation with the task condition participants  will again have probe sessions 
in the scanner  where  DLPFC  activation  and connectivity  will be determined.  
Following a 2 -week interval, participants will receive the other stimulation 
condition (sham TMS if active  first and active TMS if sham first).

epi[INVESTIGATOR_183663].  
 
Introduction  
This should include a brief paragraph or two that describes rationale for the study.  
 
1.[ADDRESS_216865] clinical technique for using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) for major 
depressive disorder (MDD) is associated with limited efficacy to date (Lefaucheur 2014; Berlim 2014). 
Among the potential causes of limited efficacy are the scalp based targeting technique that is currently 
the most common targeting method rather than techniques that incorporate fMRI -neuronavigation, which 
have been shown to have greater efficacy (Fitzgerald 2009a). Image guided TMS can target specific 
functional brain networks with greater resolution that takes into account individual differences in brain 
anatomy. Another technique for improving treatment efficacy may be to combine it with cognitive 
activation of the DLPFC designed to activate the same neural circuitry that is targeted by  
[CONTACT_7712]. Cognitive paired associative stimulation builds on the well -establi shed paradigm of paired 
associative stimulation (PAS). In that paradigm, co -activation of sensorimotor cortex with afferent 
stimulation of the median nerve timed to arrive as a TMS pulse is delivered to motor cortex, has been 
shown to increase cortical res ponse to subsequent stimuli (Ziemann 2008). Analogously, simultaneous 
activation by 2 neurostimuli (TMS to DLPFC and task activating DLPFC) could result in greater cortical 
activation and have a greater effect on executive function cognitive control than e ither stimulus alone. 
Several studies now suggest that the brain “set” is critical in determining TMS effect (McKinley et al) and 
that simultaneous task activation can augment TMS efficacy (Li et al). It is not known whether the specific 
mode of cognitive activation is critical or whether the absolute amplitude of activation is more important. 
One theory proposes that tasks that activate the DLPFC promotion system via priming will maximally 
augment TMS treatment (Strauman 2013; Detloff & Strauman 2016), suggesting that the nature of the 
task is critical in TMS augmentation. Another set of observations (McTeague et al 2018) has found that 
magnitude but not the valence of emotional arousal predicted TMS augmentation. This suggests that it 
may not be task type but rather magnitude of emotional arousal that influences maximal TMS treatment 
augmentation.  
 
Significance : this protocol builds on the RDoC construct of cognitive control to assess the neural 
substrates involved in TMS activation as well as task -induced TMS augmentation. By [CONTACT_183677] a 
passive vs active version of the SST working memory task we can examine the effect of manipulation 
characteristics of tasks and by [CONTACT_183678]. emotional versions of the task we can probe the 
contribution of emotional arousal to the effects. Further by [CONTACT_183679] (including a task control condition) we can determine the effect of task augmentation on TMS.

task effects, task -specific TMS augmentation effects and task -specific augmentation of TMS 
neuromodulation.  
 
3.1 Primary  Objective  
 
We will determine both an “intensity (difficulty) effect” and an “emotion effect” of task -induced fMRI activity 
in the scanner, collecting these measures in the same subjects. Participants will receive two working 
memory tasks: 
1a) Sternberg Sorting Task (SST): a cognitive task co mparing low -load vs. high- load conditions in 
which the pi[INVESTIGATOR_183659].  
1b) International Affective Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2980] (IAPS): an emotional task using IAPS pi[INVESTIGATOR_183664]. The number of images will vary by [CONTACT_183675], but for 
both the high-load & low-load conditions,  participants  will look at IAPS pi[INVESTIGATOR_183665]. Further, jittered within this design will be both neutral and negative blocks of IAPS  pi[INVESTIGATOR_499].  
 
We will compare low -load vs. high- load brain activation and connectivity in the cognitive vs. emotional tasks.  
 
Hypothesis 1a: Compared with the maintenance (low -load) SST condition, the high- load cognitive SST 
condition will produce greater DLPFC activation and dIPFC/sgACC anticorrelation.  
Hypothesis 1b: Compared with the low -load IAPS emotional task, the high -load IAPS emotional pi[INVESTIGATOR_183666]/sgACC anticorrelation.  
Hypothesis 1c: The pi[INVESTIGATOR_183667] w ill be correlated with the activity in the DLPFC and 
dIPFC/sgACC anticorrelation.  
 
 
Secondary Objectives:  
 
Aim 2: to determine which task provides greater augmentation of the TMS -induced DLPFC 
activation, participants will receive in randomized order:  
1) The cognitive SST working memory task or the IAPS task  alone  
2) rTMS + the cognitive SST working memory task or rTMS + the IAPS emotional task in 
randomized order. rTMS and the cognitive tasks will be conducted in the fMRI scanner where 
brain activation to a TMS probe and connectivity will be obtained.  
3) rTMS  alone  
 
Hypothesis 2a: rTMS + either task will have greater DLPFC activation and greater dIPFC/sgACC 
anticorrelation than rTMS alone.  
Hypothesis 2b: rTMS + the IAPS emotional working memory task will have greater DLPFC activation and 
greater dIPFC/sgACC anticorrelation than rTMS + cognitive SST (more robust)  
Hypothesis 2c: rTMS + IAPS emotional task will have greater signal to noise (more selective).  
 
Aim 3: to determine the effect  of neuromodulation on DLPFC  activation healthy  participants  will be 
randomized  to one of the 3 task conditions:  high- load cognitive  SST,  high- load IAPS task,  or low-load SST 
(sham task condition). Following a 4 session course ([ADDRESS_216867]  4 hours  on a second day) of either  active  rTMS  or sham  TMS 
neuromodulation in combination with the task condition participants will again have probe sessions in the 
scanner where DLPFC activation and connectivit y will be determined. Following a 2- week interval, 
participants will receive the other stimulation condition (sham TMS if active first and active TMS if sham 
first).  
 
Hypothesis 3a: Task (any of the 3) + active rTMS will result in greater DLPFC activation and greater 
dIPFC/sgACC anticorrelation than task plus sham rTMS  
Hypothesis 3b: the IAPS task in combination with active rTMS will produce greater activation than the 
cognitive SST + active TMS or than control task + active TMS.

4 Investiga tional  Plan  
 
Below is an example of the proposed study flow after screening visit. Please refer to attached task 
descriptions for further information:  
 
 
4.1 General  Design  
A mechanism oriented study, with within subjects design will be used. Healthy volunteer  participants who 
are between 18 – [ADDRESS_216868] location of the 
“Fitzgerald Target” in their DLPFC. Study staff will use FSL to analyze the images and communicate the 
coordinates via BrainSight to study coordinators. Participants will complete within subject comparisons and 
then will be randomized to a [ADDRESS_216869] phase participants will complete:  
1) low-load condition vs high -load condition in the (cognitive)  SST 
2) low-load condition vs high -load condition in the (emotion) IAPS  task 
 
They will then complete again (in randomized order) with rTMS:  
1) rTMS  alone  
2) rTMS + SST  (cognitive)  
3) rTMS + IAPS (emotion)  
 
rTMS and the cognitive tasks will be conducted in the fMRI scanner where brain activation to a TMS probe 
and connectivity data will be obtained.  
 
Finally they will be assigned to one of [ADDRESS_216870] of  neuromodulation on DLPFC 
activation. Healthy participants will be randomized to one of 3 task conditions: high- load SST, high- load 
IAPS or low -load SST (sham task). Following a 4 session course of either active rTMS or sham rTMS 
neuromodulation (both acti ve rTMS & Sham rTMS: at 120% RMT in triplet 50 Hz bursts, repeated at 5 Hz; 
2 s on and 8 s off; 600 pulses  per session;  for a total duration of 3 min. and 9 s) in combination  with one of 

Page [ADDRESS_216871] single pulse probes (120% RMT; 77 pulses/session) 
sessions in the scanner where DLPFC activation and connectivity will be determined. In this protocol we 
will use anatomically guided rTMS alone or in combination with tasks to test the hypothesis that cogni tive 
paired associative stimulation results in augmented cortical response.

6 Study  Procedures  
A mechanism oriented study, with within subjects design will be used. Healthy volunteer participants who 
are between 18 – [ADDRESS_216873] location of the 
“Fitzgerald Target” in their DLPFC. Study staff will use Brain Site to analyze the images and communicate 
the coordinates to study coordinators. Participants will complete within subject c omparisons and then will 
be randomized to a [ADDRESS_216874] phase participants will receive:  
1) a low load condition vs a high load condition in the SST 
2) a low load condition vs a high load condition in the IAPS  task 
 
They will then receive in randomized order:  
1) rTMS  alone  
2) rTMS + the SST  or 
3) rTMS + the IAPS task in randomized order.  
 
rTMS and the cognitive tasks will be conducted in the fMRI scanner where brain activation to a TMS probe 
and connectivity data will be obtained.  
 
Finally they will be  assigned to one of [ADDRESS_216875] of neuromodulation on DLPFC 
activation. Healthy participants will be randomized to one of 3 task conditions: high- load SST, high- load 
IAPS or low -load SST (sham task). Following a 4 session course of eit her active iTBS or sham TMS 
neuromodulation (both iTBS & Sham: at 120% RMT in triplet 50 Hz bursts, repeated at 5 Hz; 2 s on and 8 
s off; 600 pulses per session; for a total duration of 3 min. and 9 s) in combination with one of the [ADDRESS_216876] single pulse probe (120% RMT; 77 pulses/session; 2.4 s each) 
sessions in the scanner where DLPFC activation and connectivity will be determined. In this protocol we 
will use anatomically guided TMS alone or in combination with tasks  to test the hypothesis that cognitive 
paired associate stimulation results in augmented cortical response.  
 
Although there are no known risks related to MRI on pregnant women or a fetus, there is a possibility of 
yet undiscovered pregnancy related risks. Since there is no possible benefit from participating in this 
protocol for a pregnant woman, we will exclude pregnant women. All women of child bearing potential are 
asked if they are using a reliable method of birth control and are required too attest that they are not 
pregnant before study visit and on the TMS safety screening form.

The primary investigator will routinely monitor and evaluate study procedures for potential increased risk.  
 
8 Statistical  Plan  
 
Efficacy within subjects: Repeated measures ANOVA will be used to assess changes from baseline to 
post-stimulation for each task condition.  
 
Efficacy between subjects: neuro -response rates and time to response will be compared with published 
rates within the literature to extrapolate the significance of this modality.  
 
9 Safety and Adverse Events  
 
9.1 Definitions  
 
9.1.1  Adverse  Event  
An adverse event (AE) is any symptom, sign, illness or experience that develops or worsens in severity 
during the course of the study. Intercurrent illnesses or injuries should be regarded as adverse events. 
Abnormal results of diagnostic procedures are considered to be adverse events if the abnormality:  
• results in study  withdrawal  
• is associated with a serious adverse event  
• is associated with clinical signs or  symptoms  
• leads to additional treat ment or to further diagnostic  tests  
• is considered by [CONTACT_137032]  
 
9.1.2  Serious Adverse Event 
Serious Adverse  Event  
Adverse events are classified as serious or non -serious. A serious adverse event is any AE that is:  
• fatal 
• life-threatening 
• requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_157581] 13 of 21 
CONFIDENTIAL

• results in persistent or significant disability or  incapacity  
• a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
• an important medical  event  
 
Important medical events are those that may not be immediately life threatening, but are clearly of major 
clinical significance. They may jeopardize the subject, and may require intervention to prevent one of the 
other serious outcomes noted above. For example, drug overdose or abuse, a seizure that did not result in 
in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or intensive treatment of bronchospasm in an emergency department would 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_15355].  
 
All adverse events that do not meet any of the criteria for serious should be regarded as non -serious 
adverse events . 
 
For additional information on definitions and clarifications which may be helpful in creating the safety 
monitoring portion refer to Appendix 17.[ADDRESS_216880], the investigator will seek information on adverse events by [CONTACT_28812], as appropriate, by [CONTACT_5148]. Information on all adverse events will be recorded 
immediately in the  source document, and also in the appropriate adverse event module of the case report 
form (CRF). All clearly related signs, symptoms, and abnormal diagnostic procedures results should 
recorded in the source document, though should be grouped under one diagnosis.  
 
All adverse events  occurring during the study  period will be recorded.  The clinical  course of each event  will 
be followed until resolution, stabilization, or until it has been determined that the study intervention or 
participation is not the cause. Serious adverse events that are still ongoing at the end of the study period 
will be followed up to determine the final outcome. Any serious adverse event that occurs after the study 
period and is considered to be possibly related to the study inter vention or study participation will be 
recorded and reported immediately.  
 
9.3 Relationship of AE to  Study  
The relationship of each  adverse  event  to the study  procedures  will be determined by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_6254]-PI [INVESTIGATOR_183669]: definitely related, probably related, possibly related, unlikely or 
unrelated.  
 
9.4 Reporting of Adverse Events, Adverse Device Effects and Unanticipated  Problems  
Unexpected and related Adverse Events will be reported to the IRB by [CONTACT_150609] 72 hours of 
knowledge of the event;  all other  adverse  events  will be reported at the time of continuing review.  Reporting 
of Serious Adverse Events will occur within [ADDRESS_216881] Keepi[INVESTIGATOR_007]  
 
10.1 Confidentiality, Data Collection/Management, & Records Retention  
We will collect the following PHI: name, address, social security number (for compensation purposes) visit 
dates, telephone number, and email address. Patients entering the study will be given a unique 
identifying code. This code will be used on all data obtained from scans or study visits. Only one 
password protected document connecting the code with the participant name (in the form of first two 
letters of t he first name, first three letters of the last name) will exist. Everything will be immediately coded 
and this coded information will be stored in secure cabinets inside locked rooms or in password 
protected, IRB compliant online databases, such as REDCap.  PHI will be stored separately in secure 
cabinets inside locked rooms. Coded data will be stored on a secure server at the University of 
Pennsylvania through the Neuroscience Neuroimaging Group computing cluster. MRI data are securely 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_183670]. Coded data are directly uploaded to the computing cluster from the 
computers on which the data are collected. The Penn computers are in our s ecured lab space and 
connected directly to the uphs encrypted network. None of these data will contain personal identifiers 
such as name, social security number, address, or phone number. We will be using Neuroflow software 
for recording participants heart  rate during each TMS treatment session. NeuroFlow's software platform 
analyzes data from a commercially available, third -heart rate monitor. NeuroFlow follows strict HIPAA 
guidelines with respect to patient privacy and data security, both from a technical  and administrative 
respective. The heart rate data will be recorded using an online, password protected software, Neuroflow. 
Only deidentified data will be recorded using this platform, no identifiers will be entered on the platform. At 
the conclusion of the study, coded copi[INVESTIGATOR_183671]- identified form for future analyses.  
 
Computer -based files containing electronic PHI, that are not part of the EMR, will be kept on the Penn 
Network server.  
 
11 Study Monitoring, Auditing, and Inspecting  
 
11.1 Study Monitoring Plan  
This study will be monitored according to the monitoring plan attached by [CONTACT_183685] -annually.  
 
11.2 Auditing and  Inspecting  
The investigator will permit study -related monitoring, audits, and inspections by [CONTACT_1383]/IRB, the sponsor, 
government  regulatory  bodies,  and University  compliance  and quality  assurance groups  of all study  related 
documents (e.g. source documents, regulatory documents, data collection instruments, study data et c.). 
The investigator will ensure the capability for inspections of applicable study -related facilities (e.g. 
pharmacy, diagnostic laboratory,  etc.).  
 
Participation as an investigator in this study implies acceptance of potential inspection by [CONTACT_28832].  
 
12 Ethical  Considerations  
This study is to be conducted in accordance with applicable US government regulations and international 
standards of Good Clinical Practice, and applicable institutional research policies and procedures.  
 
This protocol and any amendments will be submitted to a properly constituted independent Ethics 
Committee (EC) or Institutional Review Board (IRB), in agreement with local legal prescriptions, for formal 
approval of the study conduct. The decision of the EC/IRB concerning the conduct of the study will be made 
in writing to the investigator and a copy of this decision will be provided to the sponsor before 
commencement of this study.

12.1 Risks  
Clinical interview and assessment : Some discomfort may be associated with the clinical assessments 
conducted in this study. Participants may experience emotional discomfort when answering some 
questions in the questionnaires or when talking about  personal information. Participants may choose not 
to answer any of the questions and to terminate your participation.  
 
MRI Scan:  
• Claustrophobia : participants may experience claustrophobia within the MRI scanner. A MRI 
scan requires participants lay in a partially enclosed space inside the scanner. Some people may 
find this to be uncomfortable and claustrophobic. Participants will be given an emergency call 
button in the scan and reminded to notify study staff if they suffer from  claustrophobia.  
• Magnetic Fields: There are no known health risk associated with exposure to magnetic fields 
during an MRI. There are minimal risks from the loud noise associated with the MRI scanner and 
from the discomfort of lying on a hard surface. We shall provide participants w ith protective 
earplugs as necessary and make every attempt to ensure their comfort with blankets, etc. during 
their time in the scanner.  
• Flying Objects : The known risks associated with this study are minimal. Implanted medical 
devices and metallic foreign fragments inside a participant’s body may pose a risk if they were to 
enter the MRI magnet room. Therefore, each participant will complete an MRI safety screening 
form at screening  and prior to each scan.  The greatest  risk is a magnetic  object  flying  through the 
air toward the magnet and hitting a participant. To reduce this risk we require that all people 
involved with the study remove all magnetic metal from their clothing and all magnetic metal 
objects from their pockets. No magnetic metal objects are allowed to be brought into the magnet 
room at any time except by [CONTACT_28927]. In addition, once participants are in the magnet, 
the door to the room will be closed so that no one inadvertently walks into the room.  
• Incidental Findings Clause : it is po ssible that during the course of the research study, the 
research staff may notice unexpected finding(s) on a participant’s images. Should this occur, the 
finding(s) will be considered by [CONTACT_28928] [INVESTIGATOR_183672] -up. These possible finding(s) will not be disclosed to the participant 
unless deemed necessary by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_183673].  
• Pregnancy : although there are no known risk s related to MRI on pregnant women or a fetus, 
there is a possibility of yet undiscovered pregnancy related risks. Since there is no possible 
benefit from participating in this protocol for a pregnant woman, we will exclude pregnant  women.  
 
iTBS & TMS:  this study utilizes two forms of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS): intermittent Theta 
Burst Stimulation (iTBS) & single pulse TMS. TMS is a FDA- approved non- invasive brain stimulation 
technique for a variety of diagnoses. As with any technique, ther e may be long -term risks due to TMS that 
are currently unknown. The most common side effect of TMS (approximately 25% of patients) is a mild 
headache. There are no known long- term adverse effects reported with the use of this device. Rarely, 
device malfunc tion could result in a scalp burn (less than 1% of patients). There may be long- term risks 
that are currently unknown  
 
• Magnetic Fields : are produced during TMS treatment. The stimulation intensities used are 
thought to be without harm. The exception is if participants have a cardiac pacemaker, or a 
certain type of metallic clip in their body (i.e., an aneurysm clip). In addition to responding to 
questions about potential MRI risks prior to scheduling a screening visit, participants will also be 
asked to com plete a ‘TMS treatment screening (TTS)’ form at the screening visit prior to receiving 
any stimulation so participants with these devices are excluded from the study, as any form of 
TMS could cause these object to heat up, move, or malfunction. Objects suc h as watches and 
credit cards should also be removed as these could be damaged.  
• Certain Medical Diagnoses: for patients with epi[INVESTIGATOR_002], activation of the brain by [CONTACT_183686] a seizure. Patients with stroke may be at increased risk for a seizure due to 
the brain scar. Therefore, in addition to responding to questions about medical history  and

diagnosis prior to scheduling a screening visit, participants will be asked to respond to questions 
about their medical history at their screening visit prior to receiving any stimulation so participants 
with these diagnoses are excluded from the study. For a typi[INVESTIGATOR_183674], a 
TMS -induced seizure in this experiment is very unlikely.  
• Noise : TMS devices produce clicki ng sounds. To minimize this possibility, participants will be 
given protective earplugs or  headphones.  
• Nausea: although it is uncommon, approximately 5% of subjects have experienced nausea 
during the experiment. Participants can discontinue the experiment at any time if they experience 
any discomfort during the study. 
• Mild Swelling or Bruising : participants may also experience temporary and local bruising, 
swelling, or pain from the swim cap and/or muscle activation by  [CONTACT_7712].  
 
TMS & fMRI scans: There is no added risk by [CONTACT_183687].  
 
Risk to confidentiality : As with any research, there is a rare risk that confidentiality could be breached in 
this study. Breaches in confidentiality could impact a participant’s future insurability and/or employability. 
In compliance with HIPAA and GCP guidelines, we will protect participant information and PHI to the 
extent permitted by [CONTACT_183688]:  
 
All study  materials  (with  the exception of informed consent,  financial,  and safety  forms)  will only be identified 
with a randomly  generated research identification number.  All study  documents  with identifiable  information 
(i.e. informed consent, financial, and safety forms) will be stored separately from the participant file in a 
double- locked environment. As hard copy source documents are collected, they will be kept in a double-  
locked environment. Data collected during the study will be entered and stored in a password- protected 
database, accessible only to engaged study members. All electronic data will be coded and identified only 
with a randomly generated research identification number.  
 
12.[ADDRESS_216882] benefit to individual participants.  
 
12.3 Risk Benefit  Assessment  
This study is minimal risk. There is essenti ally zero risk of harm from the research procedures (MRI, TMS, 
assessments of symptoms). The potential benefit to society through the increased understanding of the 
mechanisms of neuromodulation via TMS far outweighs the potential risk from the MRI and TMS  
procedures.  Additionally,  those who would  be unable  to tolerate TMS  or an MRI scan  will be screened out. 
 
Alternatives to Participation : the alternative to participation is to not participate.  
 
12.4 Informed Consent Process / HIPAA  Authorization  
Consent  will be obtained by [CONTACT_183689]. Because this study  does  not involve  treatment, 
coercion is not a concern. Consent will be obtained in a private room where the coordinator and 
investigator(s) can explain the purpose of the study procedures and aims. Furthermore, they will explain 
that participating is completely voluntary and that not participating will not impact them negatively. The 
potential participant will be given the option to consider study enrollment and will not be forced to make a 
decision the same  day. If they decide to participate,  a combined consent  and HIPAA form will be signed by 
[CONTACT_183690]. The patient will be reminded before and after enrolling, and before any 
research procedure that their participation i s optional and has no impact on the care they can expect.  
 
[ADDRESS_216883] Stipends or Payments  
Participants will receive compensation for their time and participation, up to $200.[ADDRESS_216884] at the end of Visit 8 once all study 
procedures are complete.

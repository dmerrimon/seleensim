Analysis plan for HPV vaccine champi[INVESTIGATOR_902658]-inferiority trial is to compare Champi[INVESTIGATOR_902659] (AAT)  to Traditional AAT  on HPV vaccine initiation  among patients ages [ADDRESS_1266025] as effective as Traditional AAT for increasing HPV vaccine uptake.   
 
Design  & Power  
We will randomize 40 clinics within multiple healthcare systems to the two trial arms  (Champi[INVESTIGATOR_902660]) . To maximize balance in trial arms, we block randomization by [CONTACT_902665] a 1:[ADDRESS_1266026] ≥80% power to conclude non -inferiority of Champi[INVESTIGATOR_902661] ≥8% points over the secular trend. 
This calculation assumes: 1) a clinic -level ICC of .033 for change in HPV vaccine initiation, as observed in 
our pi[INVESTIGATOR_20732]; 2) a non -inferiority margin of .04; 3) 100 patients, ages 9 -12, per clinic on average; 4) a 
secular trend of 10% points; and 5) Traditional AAT effect of 5% points, as observed in our prior trial.[ADDRESS_1266027] size of ≥8% points with Champi[INVESTIGATOR_902662], given that we are modeling HPV 
vaccination amon g unvaccinated adolescents, whose uptake will be higher proportionally than the 
general population.  
 
The non -inferiority margin, delta, will be .04, which we have selected to detect any clinically meaningful 
difference between the effectiveness of our interventions.  To test for non -inferiority with a margin of 
.04, we will translate the lower and upper 95% confidence interval limits into predicted probability units 
and conclude that Champi[INVESTIGATOR_902663] .04.   
 
Analy tic Plan  
Primary trial outcome: HPV vaccine initiation by 12 -month follow -up  
We will assess the vaccination status of adolescents who are HPV vaccine naïve at baseline, using 
routinely collected EHR data from our healthcare systems  and submitted to the Wisconsin Collaborative 
for Healthcare Quality .  
 
We will model HPV vaccine initiation  using a generalized estimating equation (GEE) for logistic 
outcomes. GEE models accommodate non -independence due to nesting of patients within clinics by 
[CONTACT_902666]. The outcome of the model will be patient -level HPV vaccine initiation  at 
follow -up (0=no, 1=yes):

Trial arm will be the primary fixed effect as a two -level, categorical variable (Champi[INVESTIGATOR_902664]. 
Traditional AAT). Since we will be block random izing on healthcare system, system membership will be 
added as a n n-level, categorical covariate  where n is the number of participating systems . Tests will be 
2-tailed with α=.05   Statistical analyses will be conducted in SAS 9.4 (Cary, NC) and R 4.2.2.  
 
Missing Data  
We will use all available data in computing the primary outcome of HPV vaccine initiation by 12 -month 
follow -up as per our intent -to-treat protocol. We will drop the clinic  if no data are available  (e.g., due to 
clinic closure).  
 
Adjustment for  covariates  
We do n ot plan to adjust for demographic or other baseline characteristics p er CONSORT  
recommendations ( Consort , 2010 ). 
 
Secondary trial outcome  
The s econdary  trail outcome is  HPV vaccination  series completion (2 doses) at 12 months, which we will 
evaluate in the same manner as the primary outcome.

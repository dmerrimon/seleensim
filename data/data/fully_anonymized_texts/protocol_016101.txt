1.0 INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND 
1.1  Sebaceous Hyperplasia Lesions 
Sebaceous hyperplasia (SH) are benign lesions frequently seen by [CONTACT_648978]. SH lesions commonly manifest as white or yellowish, soft, small papules on the face, such 
as on the nose, cheeks and/or forehead.[ADDRESS_869823] common reason for having SHs treated or removed is due to patients not liking the 
cosmetic appearance. Since the lesions will not disappear on their own, dermatologists can remove 
them for cosmetic reasons and/or because of functional complaints.2  Some medications and home 
remedies may reduce the appearance of lesions or reduce sebum production. The purpose of this 
protocol is to compare NPS technology, using the CellFX® System to Electrodessication for the 
treatment of SH lesions from the face of healthy adult subjects.

1.2 Current Care 
Treatment is usually aimed to remove the SH lesions as well as provide improvement to overall 
cosmesis of the face. Various modalities are available to improve the appearance of SH lesions; 
however, long-standing eradication of SH remains difficult.[ADDRESS_869824] existing modalities  require multiple sessions or applications for complete 
clearance and/or prevention of recurrence. 
 
Current therapi[INVESTIGATOR_648943]. 
Topi[INVESTIGATOR_648944], facial peels, and antiandrogen medications.  Locally destructive  
or mechanical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_648945], photodynamic therapy, cryotherapy, Intralesional 
electrodesiccation, and excisional surgery.  Each treatment depends on the size, location, number, 
type, age of the patient, risk of scarring and patients’ commitment to the therapy. Risk of permanent 
scarring must be considered when treating benign lesions. Another important consideration using 
current therapi[INVESTIGATOR_648946]-inflammatory hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_371] (PIH) treatment especially in patients 
with higher Fitzpatrick skin types like Types III, V, or VI.  
 
1.[ADDRESS_869825] resort. Examples of these medications 
are spi[INVESTIGATOR_294698]. Prescription oral retinoids are also available as an option that 
temporarily shrinks sebaceous glands, but sebaceous hyperplasia lesions return after discontinuing 
therapy. Isotretinoin (13-cis-retinoic acid) has been used for sebaceous hyperplasia because of its 
ability to temporarily shrink sebaceous glands.6,7 Oral isotretinoin has proven effective in clearing 
some lesions after a few weeks of treatment, but lesions often reappear upon discontinuation of 
therapy. However, several cases of sustained improvement or clearance after cessation of therapy 
were reported in 2016, following cumulative doses ranging from 40-60 mg/kg.[ADDRESS_869826] common side effects of oral medication such 
as isotretinoin include eye irritation, joint pain, nosebleed, rash, skin infection, and tenderness of the 
bones. 
 
Topi[INVESTIGATOR_648947] a set duration of time. 
Over-the-counter products containing agents such as retinoid (vitamin A) or azelaic acid have been 
reported to helps with visibly reducing the lesion without completely removing the lesion. If the 
treated raised SHs are not clear, more topi[INVESTIGATOR_648948], as long as the treatment area is 
not irritated. The most common side effects include itching, stinging, crusting, swelling, redness, and 
scaling.

Facial Peels 
Chemical peels using salicylic, bichloroacetic (BCA), also known as dichloroacetic (DCA), or 
trichloroacetic (TCA) acids blanch lesions, destroying the tissue. The permanency of this choice 
depends on the percentage of the acid used, as the complete destruction of the gland is necessary 
to become a permanent fix. A salicylic peel is a common procedure since its beta hydroxy keratolytic 
action cleans the surface and breaches deep into the pore, infiltrating oil buildup in order to unclog 
impactions.8,[ADDRESS_869827] treatment and can be 
performed in the physician’s office. Cryotherapy involves exposing an SH lesion to extremely cold 
temperatures using liquid nitrogen. The application usually takes less than a minute and may require 
multiple treatment sessions. The sebaceous glands are damaged by [CONTACT_648979], with no nonspecific injury to the surrounding tissues.[ADDRESS_869828] cooling will disrupt the 
cellular architecture, membrane integrity, and enzymatic activity in the glands.1 Once the growth 
freezes, it tends to fall off within days. Treatment results may vary with this procedure; past research 
has shown that pi[INVESTIGATOR_648949], as well as erythema, edema, crusting, and blister 
and/or bulla formation.1 The pi[INVESTIGATOR_648950]’s Fitzpatrick Scale ranking.  
 
Laser 
Liquid nitrogen cryotherapy and other surgical methods are useful in treating these lesions but are 
difficult to tolerate in patients who have large numbers of lesions requiring treatment. Sebaceous 
hyperplasia can be removed using a laser (i.e. with argon, carbon dioxide, or pulsed-dye laser), an 
intense beam of light that burns and destroys the growth.3,[ADDRESS_869829]-treatment may be dependent on Fitzpatrick 
Scale ratings. 
 
Photodynamic Therapy  
Due to the well-known accumulation of porphyrins in the sebaceous glands, photodynamic therapy 
(PDT) may be an effective treatment option.11  PTD is a light-emitting therapy in which the SH lesions 
are treated with combined use of 5-aminolevulinic acid and visible light. More specifically, the skin 
is pre-treated using a photosensitizing, prescription gel (5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA), that reacts with 
the light source, either IPL or a 405-420 nanometer blue light laser.11 Generally, this mode of 
treatment will require several treatment visits, such as 4 sessions at 4-week interval when using the 
405-420nm blue light laser.11 Adverse effects of photodynamic therapy in treating SH were mainly 
temporary erythema and edema, but some treated lesions underwent burning and blistering before 
healing.10

not develop nearby. Risk factors include reopening of wounds, scarring, temporary or permanent

1.5 Alternative Approach  
CellFX® System  
 
The CellFX System is intended to clear the skin of benign, undesired skin lesions as an alternative to 
surgery and other more destructive methods for removing non-neoplastic benign lesions. The CellFX 
System utilizes non-thermal, localized delivery of a timed series of low energy, nanosecond electrical 
pulses that can trigger regulated cell death.  The non-thermal effect on tissue takes place in a very 
shallow depth of skin directly below the sterile treatment tip. Histology of skin treated with CellFX 
has demonstrated selective non-thermal effects on cellular structures, including melanocytes, 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_73915], and sebaceous glands, with no apparent damage to the adjacent acellular dermis.  
The device delivers less energy to tissue, but none of these emit thermal energy unlike laser, electro-
surgery, or electro-cautery equipment.

PRIOR CLINICAL STUDIES SUMMARY 
Twelve (12) clinical studies have been or are currently being conducted using IRB approved non-
significant risk protocols and consent with the Nano-Pulse Stimulation (NPS) device. A combined total 
of approximately 3,[ADDRESS_869834] been delivered to 627 adult Subjects. Anatomic 
locations where NPS has been used include the face, abdomen, truncal, back, arms, legs, hands, and 
feet. Discomfort in all protocols was managed with localized injected buffered Lidocaine with 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]. Side effects consisted of relatively minor reactions consistent with routine wound 
healing. No device or procedure complications and no serious related adverse events were reported. 
Only minor expected adverse skin effects that resolved within days of the procedure. 
 
Published data from the initial use of Nano-Pulse Stimulation (NPS) technology for the treatment of 
sebaceous hyperplasia (SH) conducted under Protocol NP-SH-[ZIP_CODE] (June 28, 2018 through 
November 29, 2018) in 72 subjects (Fitzpatrick Skin Types I-IV) and 226 primary treated lesions along 
with 18 retreated lesions at 30-days (n=244) demonstrated greater than 99% investigator rated 
clearance efficacy with [ADDRESS_869835] NPS.  Efficacy was reported at 91% of 
treated lesions being rated clear or mostly clear at 60-days post-last NPS with a single treatment. 
There were no serious adverse events reported. However, in some subjects there were lesion 
observations of mostly mild post-treatment hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_648955] 45% and skin surface irregularities 
of 33%.  In comparison to the literature, these observations are routinely observed when using 
treatment modalities like laser with reported hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_648956] 30-60%15-16 and 
volume irregularity of 24%.17 
 
In a second pi[INVESTIGATOR_648957]-response design18 under Protocol NP-SH-009 (July, 18, 2019 
through February, 19, 2020) using much lower energy profiles (30, 60 and 115 mJ/mm3) as compared 
to NP-SH-006, showed efficacy rates of 82%, 81%, and 92%, respectively in 116 subjects (Fitzpatrick 
Skin Types II-IV) and [ADDRESS_869836] NPS. Lower settings more frequently warranted 
another NPS session, with respective retreatment rates of 27%, 12% and 14%.  For lesions treated 
once, lower settings showed reduced efficacy (54%, 70%, 78%) but also reduced transient PIH rates 
(14%, 8%, 36% - typi[INVESTIGATOR_14105]) and transient focal surface irregularities (2%, 1%, 10% - also typi[INVESTIGATOR_648958]) that resolved as normal dermis filled in the area where the SH lesion cleared.  Overall subject 
satisfaction was relatively high for all lesions rated clear and mostly clear and treated with the 
2.5x2.5mm tip at the two lowest settings with 85% of lesions rated satisfied and mostly satisfied.  
This study demonstrated the use of low energy settings in a single NPS session to clear a majority of 
lesions with a low rate of transient skin effects, while a second NPS session achieves greater than 
80% clearance. 
 
This new SH comparison study under Protocol NP-SC-012 will evaluate safety and efficacy in a split 
face design using the CellFX System and pre-defined energy profile for all primary and secondary 
treatments based on Fitzpatrick Skin Types and tip size.  The comparator group will be treated with 
intralesional electrodesiccation with a needle-shaped electrode for the treatment of SH lesions. 
 
1.6   Study Rationale  
The rationale for this IDE study is to compare the safety and effectiveness of the CellFX System to 
the comparator group, Electrodessication (Hyfrecator electrosurgical unit) performed with a non-
insulated needle-shaped electrode, for the treatment of SH lesions in healthy adult subjects.

2.0  STUDY DEVICE DESCRIPTION 
The study device being evaluated is the Pulse Bioscience CellFX® System. 
 
2.1 Pulse Bioscience CellFX® System  
The CellFX System consists of an electrical pulse console (similar to devices used to electro-coagulate 
tissue) combined with a handpi[INVESTIGATOR_648959]. The handpi[INVESTIGATOR_648960] a sterile, single patient-use treatment tip.  
Once the electrical pulse console is turned on and a predetermined treatment energy setting is 
selected, a sequence of pre-programmed electrical pulses is administered to an area of skin directly 
beneath the treatment tip.  A common commercially available sterile contact [CONTACT_648980]. The three system 
components are as follows, shown in Figures 1-3 .

2.2 Proposed Indication for Use 
The Pulse Biosciences’ CellFX System is investigational in the U.S. and the system is indicated for 
dermatologic procedures requiring ablation and resurfacing of the skin including the treatment of 
benign lesions like sebaceous hyperplasia 
 
2.3 Electrosurgical System 
The comparator device that will be used in this study is the C ONMED Hyfrecator® [ADDRESS_869837] with a 3/32” shaft non-insulated epi[INVESTIGATOR_648962]. All physicians are required to use the same needle electrode (e.g. Segal® Reusable 
Electrodes, Epi[INVESTIGATOR_648963]).  
 
3.0 PROTOCOL 
3.1 Study Objectives 
The primary objective of this study is to compare the safety and effectiveness of the CellFX System 
to Electrodessication (Hyfrecator electrosurgical unit) performed with a non-insulated needle-
shaped electrode for removal and treatment of SH lesions in healthy adult subjects.  
 
The following objectives are to evaluate the overall response to CellFX and Electrodessication: 
 SH lesion response after treatment vs. the pre-treated appearance of the same lesion 
 SH lesion response at various points in time over several weeks following the initial 
treatments vs. the same pre-treated lesion 
 Document the condition of skin in the treatment areas (erythema, swelling, crusting, 
hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_371], hypopi[INVESTIGATOR_371], etc.) over the course of various time periods post-
initial CellFX and Electrodessication treatment, and  
 Document all safety related issues that may be considered as adverse side effects or 
serious adverse events 
 
3.[ADDRESS_869838]’s selected lesions at baseline and 
treated lesions post treatment and at 7-days, 30-days, and 60-days following the last CellFX 

NP-SC-012 – CellFX vs Electrodessication Study                   
   
Page [ADDRESS_869839]-initial CellFX and Electrodessication treatments. At the 30-day follow-up visit, if any lesion 
is rated  1-4  on the Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (GAIS), the lesion must receive an additional 
treatment. In case of a second treatment, the subject will be evaluated by [CONTACT_648981] 30-days and 60-days post-retreatment. Photography of the study lesions will be 
captured along with the blinded site investigator assessments at all visits.  
 
Note:  
Eligible lesions that should be treated and do not receive a retreatment will be considered a protocol 
deviation. The reason(s) for not receiving an additional treatment will be collected on the electronic 
case report form (eCRF). These subjects will remain in the study and will be included in the ITT 
population. 
 
Additionally, the subjects can only receive one additional treatment or up to a maximum of two 
CellFX or Electrodessication treatments. 
 
3.3 Randomization 
All enrolled subjects will be randomized to receive the two treatments in a split-face design with 
CellFX being used on only one side of the face and Electrodessication on the other side. 
Randomization will be implemented through the Electronic Data Capture (EDC) system.  The 
randomization assignment will include the type of treatment and which side of the face to treat first. 
For example: 1) First Treatment = CellFX and 2) Side of Face = Right. All randomized subjects will be 
included in the intent-to-treat analysis. 
 
3.4  CellFX Procedure 
The intended CellFX treatment device is described as the CellFX® System using the skin contact[CONTACT_648982] “tip” ranging in sizes from 1.5 mm x 1.5 mm  to 5.0 mm x 5.0 mm in 
length and width and 2.0 mm in depth. Each tip will be used with pre-determined energy settings 
displayed on the CellFX Console and are provided in Table 1.  These energy settings do not exceed 
the maximum safe ranges of settings previously tested in clinical studies. A local anesthetic will be 
used to manage potential treatment discomfort during the CellFX treatment. All subjects will be 
monitored for muscle “twitching” on the face during each CellFX treatment and the subjects will be 
asked whether they felt any muscle “twitch” during the treatment.

6.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 Further details of planned analyses can be found in the statistical analysis plan (SAP). 
 
6.1 Co-Primary Endpoints 
Clinical acceptance of treatment with the CellFX System for SH lesions requires both non-inferior 
improvement in lesion appearance (effectiveness) and non-inferior rates of adverse skin changes 
(safety) versus Electrodessication. Because both features are critically important for treatment 
acceptability, this study is designed with 3 co-primary endpoints (1 related to appearance and 2 
related to adverse skin changes).  All [ADDRESS_869857] demonstrate non-inferiority be considered 
successful. 19   These co-primary endpoints are: (1) rate of pi[INVESTIGATOR_648964] [ADDRESS_869858] treatment, (2) rate of skin textural changes at [ADDRESS_869859] treatment and (3) rate of 
improvement in aesthetic appearance.  All [ADDRESS_869860] treatment. The skin textural change primary safety 
endpoint is the proportion of lesions with the presence of crusting, flaking, or other skin textural 
change. The primary effectiveness endpoint is the proportion of lesions classified as responders on 
the Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (GAIS).[ADDRESS_869861] CellFX or Electrodessication treatment as 
assessed by [CONTACT_648986]. The timing of the evaluation of this endpoint is lesion 
specific as some lesions may not require a second treatment with the CellFX System or 
Electrodessication. Lesions will be categorized as having this safety event if any component 
(hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_371], hypopi[INVESTIGATOR_371], or scarring) is present at the follow-up visit [ADDRESS_869862] treatment.  
 
Clinical justifications for the 15% non-inferiority margin for the primary safety endpoints include 
the avoidance of electrosurgical smoke plume, which may be harmful to patients and providers,20 
as well as existing safety data that demonstrate no serious adverse events. Safety data show a 
comparable safety profile for CellFX compared to the predicate devices for this indication, with 
the suggestion of faster healing. 
 
The statistical hypotheses to be evaluated for the pi[INVESTIGATOR_648965]: 
 
H0: pCellFX - pElectro  ≥ 15% at [ADDRESS_869863] treatment, versus 
HA: pCellFX - pElectro < 15% at [ADDRESS_869864] treatment  
 
Where p CellFX and p Electro are the proportion of lesions with any of these events 
(hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_371], hypopi[INVESTIGATOR_371], or scarring) in each treatment group. The null 
hypothesis will be rejected if the upper bound of the 2-sided 95% confidence interval for the 
absolute difference in proportions (p CellFX - pElectro) is less than 15%. This approach is equivalent to 
a 1-sided test with a 2.5% type I error rate. To be clinically meaningful, the absolute difference 
should not exceed 7.5%. 
 
This second safety endpoint is the presence or absence of skin textural changes (scaling, flaking 
etc.) at [ADDRESS_869865] CellFX or electrodessication treatment as assessed by [CONTACT_648990]. The timing of the evaluation of this endpoint is lesion specific as some lesions 
NP-SC-012 – CellFX vs Electrodessication Study                   
   
Page [ADDRESS_869866] treatment. 
 
The statistical hypotheses to be evaluated for the skin texture change primary safety endpoint 
are: 
 H 0: pCellFX - pElectro  ≥ 15% at [ADDRESS_869867] treatment, versus 
 H A: pCellFX - pElectro < 15% at [ADDRESS_869868] treatment  
 
Where pCellFX and pElectro are the proportion of lesions with scaling, flaking or other skin textural 
changes in each treatment group. The null hypothesis will be rejected if the upper bound of the 
2-sided 95% confidence interval for the absolute difference in proportions (p CellFX - pElectro) is less 
than 15%. This approach is equivalent to a 1-sided test with a 2.5% type I error rate. To be 
clinically meaningful, the absolute difference should not exceed 7.5%. 
 
Because multiple lesions are treated within subjects, the difference in proportion and 95% 
confidence interval will be calculated using generalized estimating equations (GEE).[ADDRESS_869869]. 
 
6.1.2 Primary Effectiveness Endpoint 
The primary effectiveness endpoint is response measured by [CONTACT_648991] (GAIS) at [ADDRESS_869870] CellFX or Electrodessication treatment ([ADDRESS_869871] treatment). GAIS score will be assessed by [CONTACT_648992], blinded to 
treatment assignment, who will classify the response for each lesion based on photographs taken 
at baseline and [ADDRESS_869872] treatment. The 3 observers will assign a score based on the 5-
level GAIS scale described in this section. For analysis purposes, the lesion will be classified as a 
responder if 2/3 blinded observers assign a score of 4 or 5, and as a non-responder if 2/3 blinded 
observers assign a score of 1, 2 or 3.  The timing of the evaluation of this endpoint is lesion 
specific as some lesions may not require a second treatment with the CellFX System or 
Electrodessication. The GAIS scale22 describes aesthetic changes as follows: 
 
 
 
 
 
The primary effectiveness endpoint is lesion-level GAIS response, defined as a score of 5 (“Much 
Improved) or 4 (“Improved) versus non-response defined as a score of 3, 2 or 1 (“No Change”, 
“Worse”, “Much Worse”) for at least 2/3 blinded observers. This dichotomization of the GAIS 
scale has been used to define response in several previous cosmetic procedures.23-26 GAIS Rating Description  
5=Much Improved  Marked improvement in appearance from the initial condition, touch -up 
treatment(s) is not indicated 
4=Improved  Obvious improvement in appearance from the initial condition, but a 
touch-up or re-treatment is indicated 
3=No Change  The appearance is essentially the same as the original condition  
2=Worse The appearance is worse than the original condition  
1=Much Worse  The appearance is much worse than the original condition  
NP-SC-012 – CellFX vs Electrodessication Study                   
   
Page 22 of 40  
The 15% non-inferiority margin for the primary effectiveness endpoint is justified by [CONTACT_648993].  Outcomes for standard of care 
Electrodessication procedures depend heavily upon operator skill and experience. Furthermore, 
electrodesiccation involves destruction of the entire gland but can lead to sequelae such as 
scarring and discoloration. Therefore, depending on the number of lesions and the cosmetic 
concerns of the patient, it may be necessary to avoid such interventions.[ADDRESS_869873] procedure that is reproducible among providers with 
fewer sequelae. 
 
The statistical hypotheses to be evaluated for the primary efficacy endpoint are: 
 
H0: pCellFX - pElectro  ≤ -15% at [ADDRESS_869874] treatment, versus 
HA: pCellFX - pElectro > -15% at [ADDRESS_869875] treatment 
 
Where p CellFX and p Electro are the proportion of lesions with a GAIS response (“Much Improved” or 
“Improved”) in each treatment group. The null hypothesis will be rejected if the lower bound of 
the 2-sided 95% confidence interval for the absolute difference in proportions (p CellFX - pElectro) is 
greater than -15%, which is equivalent to a 1-sided test with a 2.5% type I error rate. 
 
Because multiple lesions are treated within subjects, the 95% confidence interval will be 
calculated using GEE.[ADDRESS_869876] be 
greater than 60%. 
 
6.2 Secondary Endpoints 
Details of the planned analyses for secondary endpoints can be found in the statistical analysis plan. 
No formal hypotheses will be tested for secondary endpoints. Secondary endpoints collected in this 
study are as follows: 
1.  The investigator,  blinded to treatment assignment, will classify the aesthetic change for each 
lesion using photographs taken at baseline as a reminder of baseline condition. The score will be 
assigned based on the in-person observation at [ADDRESS_869877] treatment between 
CellFX and Electrodessication.  Wound healing includes evaluation of the following: 
 Hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_371] 
 Hypopi[INVESTIGATOR_648966]-SC-012 – CellFX vs Electrodessication Study                   
   
Page 23 of 40  
 Erythema 
 Crusting 
 Scabbing 
 Flaking 
 Scarring 
 Other surface irregularities 
 
The rate of each event individually and a composite of any of these events will be calculated for 
each treatment and time-point. Differences in proportion and  95% confidence interval as 
described for the hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_371], hypopi[INVESTIGATOR_648967], convergence permitting. 
 
4. The GAIS Scale  will be used to measure aesthetic improvement for each treated lesion site (left, 
right).23-26  
 
The proportion with each response will be summarized. An analysis will be performed using the 
same response definition as for the primary efficacy outcome (see Section 6.1.2 ) to compare 
investigator and subject perception of change across treatment groups. 
 
5. A 6-point Subject Satisfaction Scale  will be used to measure subject’s satisfaction with the 
overall treatment of their SH lesions by [CONTACT_648994] (left, right): 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The proportion with each response will be summarized. An analysis will be performed using 
the binary endpoints of satisfied (“Very Satisfied” or “Satisfied”) versus not satisfied  
(“Somewhat Satisfied”, “Somewhat Dissatisfied”, “Dissatisfied”, “Very Dissatisfied”) to 
compare satisfaction across treatment groups. 
 
6. A 5-point Recommendation Scale  will be used to measure the subject’s likelihood of 
recommending the treatment procedure used on each treated lesion site (left, right) to a 
significant other, relative or friend. 
 
 
 
 
 
The frequency of each response will be tabulated by [CONTACT_3148]. The proportion with responses 
of “Highly Likely” or “Likely” will be tabulated and compared across treatments.  
7. Face Pain Scale  with an assigned numerical rating between 0 (smiling) and 10 (crying) will be Rating Description

used to assess pain immediately after the CellFX and Electrodessication treatments at Day 0 
and 30 days, if applicable. The face pain scale will be assessed immediately after each lesion 
treatment (left, right). Please see pain scale chart below. 
The number and percent will be tabulated for each level of pain for first and second treatments 
separately, and GEE models using score as a continuous dependent variable and treatment as 
a fixed covariate (adjusted for within-subject correlation) will be used to compare the least-
square mean difference in pain scores across treatment groups. 
 
 
 
 
 
6.[ADDRESS_869878] 
4 lesions in a previous study (SH-009) were sampled with replacement. An assumed mappi[INVESTIGATOR_648968] ( Section 6.7 ) and the GAIS scale: lesions rated 
as “Clear” with hypopi[INVESTIGATOR_648969] “None” or “Mild” were classified as GAIS responders. 
Among lesions rated as “Mostly Clear” with hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_648969] “None”, a binary random 
variable derived from a standard normal distribution was used to categorize 88% of these as GAIS 
responders with the remaining 12% categorized as non-responders. All other combinations of 
clearance and hypopi[INVESTIGATOR_648970]-responders. The resulting distribution of 
lesions had a GAIS response rate of 73%, which reflects discounts for both conversion to a different 
scale and a slight reduction in efficacy due to visibility differences in photo review compared to live 
assessment. Both primary safety outcomes (skin texture changes at [ADDRESS_869879] treatment) were also calculated for each lesion.  
 
For each simulation, subjects were selected from SH-[ADDRESS_869880] were randomly assigned to each treatment, which assumes equal efficacy and 
safety across treatments. The GEE models for the primary safety and primary efficacy outcome were 
used as described in Sections 6.1.1 and 6.1.2 . The proportion of simulations for which the 95% CI 
for the difference in proportions excluded the critical values for the hypotheses in Sections 6.1.1  and 
6.1.2 was calculated. This analysis (based on 10,000 simulations) demonstrated that 240 lesions 
(approximately 48 subjects) would provide at least 80% power for the coprimary endpoint hypothesis 
tests. To account for error in estimation of the mappi[INVESTIGATOR_648971], a target 
of 260 lesions (approximately 52 subjects) with follow-up at [ADDRESS_869881] treatment was set 
for adequate power. Assuming 10% loss to follow-up, up to 60 subjects will be enrolled. 

NP-SC-012 – CellFX vs Electrodessication Study                   
   
Page 25 of 40  
6.4 Populations for Analyses 
The primary analysis dataset for study outcomes will be the intent-to-treat (ITT) population wherein 
data from all randomized lesions will be analyzed based on the intended randomization assignment. 
The intent of this protocol is to apply up to [ADDRESS_869882] one treatment, and the primary efficacy analysis will also 
be calculated for this population for comparison. The modified ITT population will be the analysis 
population for the primary safety endpoints. 
 
Study outcomes will also be analyzed using a per-protocol (PP) population. The PP population 
includes all subjects who had no pre-specified inclusion and exclusion violations, received both CellFX 
and Electrodessication, and repeated the treatments per protocol for any lesions that were not clear 
at the 30-day visit.  
6.5 Sub-Group Analyses 
Primary and secondary endpoints will be evaluated for the ITT and PP populations, as well as 
analyzed in strata based on the following sub-groups: 
 
 Age 
 Prior treatment for treated SH lesions 
 Gender 
 Fitzpatrick score (I/II vs III) 
 Clinical Site 
 Treatment Energy Level 
 Size of CellFX Treatment Tip 
 Total Energy Density 
 Secondary Treatments 
 
These analyses are meant to assess consistency of treatment effects only, and this study is not 
powered for inference within subgroups. 
 
6.[ADDRESS_869883] treatment. A 4-point scale (0,1,2,3) will be used to 
characterize each lesion as “Clear”, “Mostly Clear”, “Partially Clear”, or “Not Clear”.  
 
NP-SC-012 – CellFX vs Electrodessication Study                   
   
Page 26 of 40  
Lesion Clearance Scale 
CLEAR MOSTLY CLEAR PARTIALLY CLEAR NOT CLEAR 
0 1 2 3 
The number and proportion at each level of response will be tabulated, and the proportion of 
lesions with clearance response will be compared across treatment groups using a model similar 
to the primary effectiveness outcome ( Section 6.1.2). Clearance response is defined as scores of 
0 or 1 (“Clear” or “Mostly Clear”) versus non-response defined as scores of 2 or 3 (“Partially 
Clear” or “Not Clear”). This endpoint is collected for comparison to previous trials, which used 
the Lesion Clearance Scale. 
 
6.7.[ADDRESS_869884] treatment. Subjects will be counted once 
per treatment (that is, per randomized side of face) based on whether any lesion treated with 
electrodessication or CellFX experiences hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_371], hypopi[INVESTIGATOR_648972] 
[ADDRESS_869885] treatment. The number and percentage of subjects in each of the 
following categories will be tabulated: 
 
 Subjects with no events for either treatment 
 Subjects with an event in at least 1 CellFX-treated lesion but no events in any 
electrodessication-treated lesion 
 Subjects with an event in at least 1 electrodessication-treated lesion but no events in any 
CellFX-treated lesion 
 Subjects with events in both electrodessication and CellFX-treated lesions 
This tabulation will be performed using the ITT population, but lesions will be classified as treated 
with CellFX or electrodessication based on the actual treatment received for each lesion. 
 
6.7.[ADDRESS_869886] Treatment 
Subjects will be classified based on whether all treated lesions respond to treatment (defined as 
a score of ‘4’ or ‘5’ on the GAIS scale) at [ADDRESS_869887] treatment. Subjects will be counted 
once per treatment (that is, per randomized side of face) based on whether all lesions treated 
with electrodessication or CellFX respond to treatment at [ADDRESS_869888] treatment. The 
number and percentage of subjects in each of the following categories will be tabulated: 
 
 Subjects with at least 1 lesion failing to respond in each treatment 
 Subjects with GAIS response for all CellFX-treated lesions but failure to respond for any 
electrodessication-treated lesion 
 Subjects with GAIS response for all electrodessication-treated lesions but failure to 
respond for any CellFX-treated lesion 
 Subjects with GAIS response for all lesions treated with electrodessication and CellFX-
treated lesions 
 
This tabulation will be performed using the ITT population, but lesions will be classified as treated 
with CellFX or electrodessication based on the actual treatment received for each lesion.

7.0 CLINICAL PHOTOGRAPHY  
  The Sponsor will use Canfield Scientific, Inc. to provide photography equipment and services to the study 
sites. Three close-up photographs (left, right and frontal) at each study visit will be taken with the VISIA-
CR system.  In order to ensure consistent serial clinical photography is achieved during the study, all 
subject photographs will be reviewed (monitored)  on an ongoing basis. Digital images will be transferred 
to Canfield via the secure website.  
 
8.0 INDEPENDENT PANEL REVIEW  
To meet the  requirements of the secondary endpoint, an Independent Panel  will evaluate the treatment 
response from each study device. In order to enhance objectivity and reduce potential for bias, the Panel 
shall be independent of the Sponsor as well as the study sites/investigators.  
 
The Panel is made up of three  clinicians with pertinent expertise in dermatology who are not participants 
in the study and who do not have any other real or potential conflicts of interest. The Panel will be 
provided photographs of all study lesions at baseline and [ADDRESS_869889] 
methodology.  
 
9.0  ADVERSE EVENTS 
Pulse Biosciences will classify each reported Adverse Event according to ISO [ZIP_CODE]:2011. All protocol 
specific AEs, whether device-related or not, will be recorded on the AE case report form and reported. 
Data to be collected will include the description of the AE, onset, and resolution dates (or whether the 
AE is ongoing), severity, management/treatment, outcome, and determination of the relationship to the 
device and/or procedure. All AEs related to the lesion site(s)  should be reported and classified by [CONTACT_648995].   
All AE information will be collected from enrollment through [ADDRESS_869890] CellFX and 
Electrodessication procedures. All AEs will be followed until the event has resolved (in the case of 
permanent impairment, the event will be followed until it stabilizes, and the overall clinical outcome has 
been ascertained).  
 
When reporting AEs/SAEs, the Investigator should include the following information: 
 Description of event  
 Onset of event 
 Duration of event  
 Severity 
 Relationship to device or procedure 
 Action taken 
 Subject outcome 
 
Severity describes the intensity of an event and will be assessed as: 
 Mild: The AE does not interfere in a significant manner with the subject’s normal functioning 
level.  
 Moderate : The AE produces some impairment of function but not hazardous to health. 
 Severe: The AE produces significant impairment of function or incapacities and/or it is a hazard 
to the subject. 
NP-SC-012 – CellFX vs Electrodessication Study                   
   
Page 28 of 40  
Relationship to device or procedure will be assessed as: 
 Unlikely: There is no indication that the AE was caused by [CONTACT_648996].  
 Possibly: It cannot be excluded that the AE was caused by [CONTACT_648996].  
 Likely: A causal relationship between the investigational or standard of care device and the 
AE is at least a reasonable possibility; i.e. there is evidence or argument suggesting a causal 
relationship.

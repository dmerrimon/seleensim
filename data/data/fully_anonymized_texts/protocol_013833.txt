Protocol Title: Randomized Evaluation of hypertensive Moms: Interventional Nudge to Drive transitions of care  
Short Title: REMIND Trial  
Protocol Description: Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are stress tests which identify women at high risk of future 
cardiovascular disease, However, most women do not receive adequate counseling nor do they seek 
preventative care in the months following delivery. We will perform a randomized, controlled trial 
of electronic prompts to obstetric care providers to initiate transitions of care to continuity care 
providers. This will be a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]-wide initiative using a pre-existing postpartum monitoring system.

Abstract 
Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) are stress tests which may identify women at high risk of 
future cardiovascular disease (CVD), the leading cause of death among women. Given the public health 
impact of HDP and CVD, there is a compelling need to identify scalable interventions to improve 
preventative care among women who have risk identified during pregnancy. We will examine the effects 
of delivering electronic prompts to obstetric care providers (nudge) on transitions of care in the postpartum 
period. We will conduct a pi[INVESTIGATOR_153703]-up with preventative care providers among women with 
HDP. Objectives  
Overall objectives 
The objective of the study is to evaluate the effect of a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]-wide initiative using electronic prompts to 
encourage physicians to transition care for women with HDP to continuity care providers in accordance 
with national society guidelines. 
Primary outcome variable(s) 
The primary outcome measure is documentation of counseling about transitioning care to a continuity care 
provider (primary care or cardiology) at the postpartum visit. 
Secondary outcome variable(s) 
Secondary outcomes include 1. Electronic prompts opened by [CONTACT_153711] 1 week of 
receipt.  2. Documentation of CVD risk at the postpartum visit.  3. Use of scripted dot phrases (available 
in Epic) for counseling on transitions of care and CVD risk in the postpartum note.  4. Attendance at a 
primary care or cardiology visit for preventative care within 6 months of delivery. 
Background 
Women with HDP need ongoing care in the postpartum and inter-pregnancy period. HDP, including PEC 
and gestational hypertension (GHTN), complicate up to 10% of all pregnancies and are associated with 
immediate and long-term cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.[ADDRESS_177245] a disproportionately higher morbidity and mortality compared to non-black 
women.6,7 ACOG and the American Heart Association (AHA) emphasize the postpartum period as an 
important opportunity to identify and intervene upon women at high-risk for future cardiovascular disease 
(CVD).8,9 However, current postpartum practices inadequately address transitions of care for women with 
Page 11 of 19  HDP. A significant proportion of women with HDP do not see a preventative care provider (primary care, 
cardiology) in the months after delivery.10-[ADDRESS_177246] to Health platform. HSM improves blood pressure management in the two weeks after delivery 
and eliminates racial disparities in blood pressure ascertainment during that time.13,14 However, 
enrollment in HSM did not improve follow-up in the year after delivery, with less than 1/3 of women 
having a preventative care visit.15 Poor follow-up is likely multifactorial, but may be driven by [CONTACT_153712]. Among women enrolled in HSM, only 21% of women were 
counseled on follow-up with primary care and only 4% were counseled on CVD risk at their postpartum 
visits based on chart review.[ADDRESS_177247] (EMR)

Study Design  
Phase* 
Not applicable 
Design 
This study will be a randomized, controlled superiority trial to evaluate a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]-wide initiative to 
improve counseling for postpartum women who experienced HDP during their pregnancy or in the 
immediate postpartum period.  Hypotheses: 1. We hypothesize that the prompt will increase the proportion 
of women counseled on transitioning care to a primary care provider or cardiologist after pregnancy 
(primary outcome). 2. We hypothesize that the provider nudge will increase the proportion of women 
attending a preventative care visit within [ADDRESS_177250] to Health platform will be used to generate lists 
of patients who eligible for the study. For each eligible woman, the date of and obstetric care provider for 
her postpartum visit will be recorded within 3 weeks of delivery. Patients will then be randomly assigned 
to a control group with no intervention (usual care through HSM) or the intervention group (physician 
nudge) using simple 1:[ADDRESS_177251] to Health Platform. If a woman is randomized to 
the intervention arm, her obstetric care provider for her postpartum visit will receive a staff message in 
Epic (Penn Chart) that his/her patient has an upcoming postpartum visit. The message will be sent [ADDRESS_177252] patient-specific information including hypertensive 
diagnosis, blood pressure medication(s), gestational diabetes diagnosis, and primary care provider as listed 
in the Epic banner. The message will also have dot phrases for recommended counseling and contact 
[CONTACT_153714]. There will be a dot phrase recommending 
follow-up with primary care or cardiology; counseling on risk of future CVD; and recommending aspi[INVESTIGATOR_153704] a future pregnancy.  A web-based survey will be distributed to all women in the study [ADDRESS_177253] results (platelet count, 
creatinine, liver function tests, urine protein, total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL-C, HDL-C, glucose, 
hemoglobin A1c), blood pressure measurements, height, weight, and office visits within 6 months of 
delivery will be abstracted from the EMR. We will perform detailed abstraction of counseling at the 
postpartum visit and additional office visits within 6 months of delivery focusing on 1) health maintenance 
2) hypertension, or 3) cardiovascular risk reduction. Two reviewers will assess counseling at each visit. 
We will obtain data on obstetric care providers including level (resident physician, attending physician, 
nurse practitioner, physician assistant, or certified nurse midwife), gender, and years in practice from 
publicly available databases or websites online. 
Study duration 
Estimated length of time is [ADDRESS_177254] and complete the research. Please confirm that there are adequate facilities for the research. 
The research staff will include Maternal Fetal Medicine attendings, residents in obstetrics & gynecology, 
and the Maternal and Child Health Research (MCHRC) clinical research team. The MCHRC provides an 
established infrastructure for clinical and translational research. The Way To Health platform has multiple 
features to implement this trial and capture data including two-way texting, integrated survey options, 
integration with the EMR, and automated schedules for patient messages. Patients will be clinically 
Page 13 of 19  enrolled into the WaytoHealth Texting Platform per usual clinical care. Data collection will be performed 
by [CONTACT_6283]. Triebwasser and Walheim, and by a study coordinator through the MCHRC. Patient logs for Heart 
Safe Motherhood (Way to Health) will be reviewed daily. Randomization will take place through Way to 
Health after ensuring all eligibility criteria is met. Electronic prompts will be sent to obstetric care 
providers by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Triebwasser or the study coordinator. Survey invitations will be sent through the Heart 
Safe Moterhood interface in Way to Health. All research staff will receive education regarding the protocol 
and their duties prior to the start of the study. 
Characteristics of the Study Population 
Target population

Accrual 
Sample size calculations were based on the assumption that 21% of patients in usual care and 40% of 
patients receiving a provider nudge would have documentation about transitioning care. A sample size of 
222 patients (randomized 1:1) would provide 80% power to detect this difference assuming 20% of patients 
will not attend their postpartum visit. Approximately 100 women are enrolled in HSM each month at 
Pennsylvania Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. We anticipate that over 90% of those women receive prenatal care at a UPHS 
practice (n=90 per month), and at least 80% will attend a postpartum visit (n=72). We thus anticipate that 
[ADDRESS_177255] a diagnosis made 
at time of evaluation in the Perinatal Evaluation and Treatment Unit after discharge from the delivery 
admission. HDP diagnoses are based on criteria from the American College of Obstetricians and 
Gynecologists (ACOG). 3. Enrolled in HSM at Pennsylvania Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. 4. Have a postpartum visit with a 
UPHS provider scheduled 4-12 weeks after delivery.

health maintenance 2) hypertension, or 3) cardiovascular risk reduction. Two reviewers will assess 
counseling at each visit (from the discharge summary and after visit summary). We will obtain data on 
obstetric care providers including level (resident physician, attending physician, nurse practitioner, 
physician assistant, or certified nurse midwife), gender, and years in practice from publicly available 
databases or websites online.

Analysis Plan 
We hypothesize that a provider nudge will increase the proportion of women who are counseled about 1) 
transitioning care and 2) CVD risk after pregnancy complicated by [CONTACT_153716]. This is designed as a superiority 
trial. We hypothesize that the provider nudge will lead to improved follow-up with continuity care 
providers.  Primary efficacy endpoint:  1. Documentation of counseling about transitioning care to a 
continuity care provider (primary care or cardiology) at the postpartum visit.  Secondary efficacy 
endpoints:  1. Documentation of CVD risk at the postpartum visit.  2. Attendance at a primary care or 
cardiology visit for preventative care within [ADDRESS_177259] 
will be used to compare non-parametric data. Univariate comparisons will be made between exposure 
(intervention) and outcome. Proportion and relative risk (95% CI) will be presented for primary and 
secondary outcomes. Multivariable logistic regression models will be created to control for potential 
confounders. Outcomes will be analyzed by [CONTACT_153717]. Our threshold for statistical 
significance will be two-side with alpha 0.05. Exploratory analyses: Primary and secondary outcomes will 
be analyzed by [CONTACT_545] (Black vs. Non-Black) based on data that HSM reduced racial disparities in blood 
pressure ascertainment outcomes. We will explore whether there is an interaction of race with regards to 
counseling and follow-up. We will also assess time trends in counseling over the study period.

Data confidentiality  
x Paper-based records will be kept in a secure location and only be accessible to personnel involved in 
the study.  
x Computer-based files will only be made available to personnel involved in the study through the use 
of access privileges and passwords.  
Prior to access to any study-related information, personnel will be required to sign statements agreeing 
to protect the security and confidentiality of identifiable information.  
x Wherever feasible, identifiers will be removed from study-related information.  
A Certificate of Confidentiality will be obtained, because the research could place the subject at risk 
of criminal or civil liability or cause damage to the subject's financial standing, employability, or 
liability. 
x A waiver of documentation of consent is being requested, because the only link between the subject 
and the study would be the consent document and the primary risk is a breach of confidentiality. 
(This is not an option for FDA-regulated research.)  
x Precautions are in place to ensure the data is secure by [CONTACT_71994], because the 
research involves web-based surveys.  
Audio and/or video recordings will be transcribed and then destroyed to eliminate audible 
identification of subjects.  
Subject Confidentiality 
Computer-based files will only be made available to personnel involved in the study through the use of 
access privileges and passwords. Wherever feasible, identifiers will be removed from study-related 
Page [ADDRESS_177260]-protected firewalled servers at the University of Pennsylvania. Data collected for this 
study will be stored in REDCap and the WayToHealth platform. Linkage to PHI will be stored until study 
analysis and publication completion, and then will be destroyed. 
Sensitive Research Information* 
Does this research involve collection of sensitive information about the subjects that should be excluded 
from the electronic medical record? 
No 
Subject Privacy 
Privacy refers to the person's desire to control access of others to themselves. Privacy concerns people, 
whereas confidentiality concerns data. Describe the strategies to protect privacy giving consideration to 
the following: The degree to which privacy can be expected in the proposed research and the safeguards 
that will be put into place to respect those boundaries. The methods used to identify and contact [CONTACT_153718]. The settings in which an individual will be interacting with an investigator. The privacy 
guidelines developed by [CONTACT_153719], professional associations and scholarly disciplines (e.g., 
psychiatry, genetic counseling, oral history, anthropology, psychology).  
All efforts will be made by [CONTACT_153720]. Data will be evaluated in a deidentified 
manner whenever possible. 
Data Disclosure 
Will the data be disclosed to anyone who is not listed under Personnel? 
No

Genetic testing 
If genetic testing is involved, describe the nature of the tests, including if the testing is predicative or 
exploratory in nature.  If predictive, please describe plan for disclosing results to subjects and provision of 
genetic counseling. Describe how subject confidentiality will be protected Note: If no genetic testing is to 
be obtained, write: "Not applicable." Not applicable. 
Consent 
1. Consent Process  
Overview 
A waiver of informed consent is requested for the intervention portion of this study. This is a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_153706]. The study is to evaluate that initiative. Therefore, physicians and their 
patients will not be consented as this will be the standard practice for women in Heart Safe Motherhood at 
Pennsylvania Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. Without a waiver of the consent, the initiative would still be implemented at 
Pennsylvania Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], but the study would be infeasible. There are several additional reasons why we feel 
a waiver of consent should be granted. First, it is not feasible to consent every patient and physician. 
Second, if members of the control group were consented, they would know they were being studied and 
this could change their behavior. This could potential disrupt the design of the study and making 
interpretation of the findings challenging. Third, physicians are not being forced to use the information 
from the prompt or suggested counseling with their patients. Instead, they are being reminded of evidence-
based practice and offered an opportunity to review pertinent information prior to the postpartum visit. 
This is no different than standard of care in which a physician would review the same information and 
decide on postpartum counseling. The initiative is simply a reminder for the physician and makes their 
standard of care process easier to conduct. 
Children and Adolescents

2. Waiver of Consent  
Waiver or Alteration of Informed Consent* 
Waiver of written documentation of informed consent: the research presents no more than minimal risk of 
harm to subjects and involves no procedures for which written consent is normally required outside of the 
research context 
Minimal Risk*  
Impact on Subject Rights and Welfare*  
Waiver Essential to Research*  
Additional Information to Subjects  
Written Statement of Research*  
Yes 
If no written statement will be provided, please provide justificiation 
The subjects will receive a written statement of research for the web-based survey, but will not receive a 
statement on research for the intervention as knowledge of the intervention may change behavior and make 
interpretation of the study difficult.

Risk / Benefit 
Potential Study Risks 
The potential risks associated with this study are minimal. Breach of data is a potential risk that will be 
mitigated by [CONTACT_153721], randomization, and 
web-based surveys (Way to Health) and data storage (REDCap). 
Potential Study Benefits 
An intervention that prompts obstetric care providers to actively think about postpartum care guidelines 
could contribute positively to patient care and outcomes. However, it is possible that patients will receive 
no benefit from this study. 
Alternatives to Participation (optional) 
Women will be receive postpartum counseling per the usual practice of their obstetric care provider.

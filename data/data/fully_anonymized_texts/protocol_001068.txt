Study  Information  
Indication:  Enrollment  criteria  include  all patients  with  head  and neck  cancer  undergoing  18F FDG 
PET/CT at time of primary diagnosis or after completion of therapy.  
Line of treatment:  
Phase:  Preliminary  
Number  of Subjects:  30 
Background  and Rationale:  
Provide  background  (including  references)  on unanswered  question(s)  the study  is attempting  to answer  
 
 
 
Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) makes  up 90% of head and neck cancers. The incidence is increasing, 
in part due to the human papi[INVESTIGATOR_27509] (HPV), a well -established factor in the development of HNSCC. Unfortunately, 
tumor -specific imaging for HNSCC and HPV -related HNSCC are non -existent, ma king detection and follow -up reliant on 
surrogate markers for metabolic activity. 18F FDG Positron Emission Tomography (PET), combined with computerized 
tomography  (PET/CT),  is the current  standard  for imaging  in HNSCC.  Specifically,  18F FDG  PET/CT  is used  for patients  with 
advanced stage disease, those with unknown primary site, and as part of the post -treatment imaging. 18F FDG PET/CT 
has a high sensitivity, but the specificity can be limited in pateints with underlying inflammation, infection, or aft er 
radiation therapy. As such, tumor -specific imaging has the potential to improve detection of de novo and/or recurrent 
tumors in this high risk population.  
 
 
Interestingly, HNSCCs have been found to express somatostatin receptors (SSTRs). SSTRs have also  been found in 
laryngeal cancer specimens and cancers of the oral cavity and oropharynx, but not in control tissue1,2. Recent studies 
have found that HPV causes mutations in the same pathways that activate SSTR expression on tumor cells3. These 
studies sug gest a correlation with HPV -positive HNSCC and SSTR expression. This latter group of patients often have 
non-detectable primary tumors that arise from the oropharynx, an area that normally exhibits 18F FDG PET/CT uptake 
thus making tumor localization diffi cult. Schartinger et al studied SSTR PET/CT in a small series of HNSCC patients and 
found that all  patients showed radionucleotide uptake on imaging4. Multiple case reports have been published showing 
similar uptake for head and neck squamous cell carcinom as by 68Ga5,6. An unpublished trial was performed comparing 
SSTR PET/CT with 18F FDG PET/CT for 35 patients with HNSCC; the study concluded that SSTR PET/CT had the potential  
to be more specific for HNSCC than 18F FDG PET/CT7. Unfortunately the study was  small, HPV status was not correlated, 
and recurrent/post -treatment patients were not studied. These studies show that SSTR -specific imaging, such as 
NETSPOT,  has the potential  to be equal  to and possibly  more  specific  than  18F FDG  PET/CT  for HNSCC  patients,  especially 
in the setting of HPV positivity, unknown primary site tumors, and post -treatment follow -up. More importantly, a 
therapeutic target for SSTRs is widely available; as such, HNSCC patients who show clinical updake on  NETSPOT imaging 
may be candidates for future studies using targeted therapeutics.  
Objectives  and study  aims:  
List the primary/secondary  objectives  to correspond  directly  with  the listed  hypotheses;  define  the role of AAA 
compounds  
 
Study  Aim:  
Evaluate  utility  of NETSPOT  imaging  for disease  detection  in HNSCC,  as well as the potential  for targeted  receptor - 
specific therapeutics.  
Primary  Objectives:  
To determine  the utility  of NETSPOT  imaging,  as compared  to 18F FDG  PET/CT,  in detection  and staging  of HNSCC. 
To evaluate the potential  of NETSPOT  imaging  in guiding  the use  of targeted  radiopeptides  for HNSCC  treatment. 
Secondary Objectives:  
To determine  if NETSPOT  imaging  and 18F FDG  PET/CT,  when  used  together,  can lead  to improved  tumor  delineation  and 
detection of metastatic disease.  
To determine  the imaging  charactersistics  of NETSPOT  versus  18F FDG  PET/CT  in the setting  of inflammation. 
To determine if NETSPOT imaging uptake correlates with tumor HPV -positivity.  
To determine  if patients  with  tumor  uptake  on NETSPOT  imaging  exhibit  different  disease  outcomes  than  patients 
without uptake.  
Hypothesis:  
List the clinical  hypotheses  in order  of priority  
 
NETSPOT  imaging  will be at least  equivalent  to 18F FDG  PET/CT  in the detection  and staging  of HNSCC.  
The combination  of NETSPOT  imaging  and 18F FDG  PET/CT,  will have  increased  specificity  for detecting  the primary  site 
for HNSCC of unknown primary than 18F FDG PET/CT alone.  
The combination  of NETSPOT  imaging  and 18F FDG  PET/CT,  will have  increased  specificity  for detecting  disease 
recurrence and metastasis following treatment than 18F FDG PET/CT alone.

Study  Design/Clinical  Plan:  
Provide  a concise  overview  stating  the type  of experimental  design  (for ex, randomized/non -randomized,  condensed 
eligibility criteria etc)  
 
Design:  This study  will be designed  as a “proof -of-concept”  trial to compare  NETSPOT  with  18F FDG  PET/CT  for HNSCC.  
 
 
Inclusion  Criteria:  
HNSCC  patients  undergoing  planned  18F FDG  PET/CT  at time  of primary  diagnosis. 
HNSCC patients undergoing planned 18F FDG PET/CT for unknown primary site.  
HNSCC  patients  undergoing  planned  18F FDG  PET/CT  after  completion  of adjuvant  treatment.  
 
 
Exclusion  Criteria:  
Inability  to undergo  18F FDG  PET/CT  imaging  due to medical  comorbidities.  
 
 
Enrollment:  
Patients  meeting  inclusion  criteria  will be enrolled  on evaluation.  Based  on our current clinical  volume,  we plan  to enroll 
30 patients over a 6 month time frame.  
Preliminary  analysis  (outlined  below)  will be done  after  the first 30 patients  to assess  the utility  of NETSPOT  imaging  in 
HNSCC.  
Treatment:  
List the clinical  dosage/dosage  form,  route,  and dose  regimen  
 
Brief  Overview:  
Patients  meeting  inclusion  criteria  will be consented  at the time  of scheduling. 
All patients will undergo 18F FDG PET/CT per established protocol.  
Following  18F FDG  PET/CT,  the patient  will undergo  NETSPOT  imaging  with  the AAA -provided  dose.  These  scans  will be 
performed no less than 24 hours, no more than 7 days apart.  
 
 
Analysis:  
Both  18F FDG  PET/CT  and NETSPOT  images  will be reviewed  by [CONTACT_606313]. SUV will be measured for both images and recorded.  
Patients  will undergo  clinical  follow -up based  on 18F FDG  PET/CT  results  as per protocol.  
True  positive  results  will be recorded  for both  18F FDG  PET/CT  and NETSPOT  images  and analyzed  for sensitivity  and 
specificity.  
For patients  undergoing  surgical  treatment,  pathology  results  including  routinely  reported  HPV  markers  will be recorded 
and compared to NETSPOT imaging characteristics.  
 
Follow -up 
All enrolled  patients  will be followed  for 1 year  after  imaging.  
Expected  Results/Outcomes:  
 
We expect  that 18F FDG  PET/CT  and NETSPOT  will have  similar  uptake  and specificity  for primary  tumor.  We hypothesize 
that NETSPOT will have increased specificity for unknown primary site tumor and recurrent or metastatic disease.  
Finally,  we hope  that NETSPOT  positivity  in HNSCC  will allow  for future  study  of targeted  radionuclide  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_606312].  
Applicability  of Results:  
Any other  information  regarding  the medical  need  and/or  the strategic  importance  of the research  which  may  help  the 
committee’s evaluation  
A proof -of-concept  trial to compare  SSTR/  PET/CT  with  18F FDG  PET/CT  in the head  and neck  cancer  population  would  be 
a novel use of the NETSPOT technology. The study is warranted based on past data and the potential for success, 
especially in patients with oropharyngeal tumors, previous radiation or inflammatory disease; all of whom 18F FDG 
PET/CT is difficult to inte rpret. If the hypothesis is supported, Advanced Accelerator will have a new application for the 
NETSPOT technology and a new area for business development and revenue.  
Additional  Research  (if applicable): 
Histology, biomarkers, PK etc.  
 
Statistical  Plan:  
Include  justification  for clinical  sample  size and primary  hypothesis  testing  
 
Statistical  Considerations:  
The primary  objective  of this study  is to evaluate  SSTR  receptor  expression  in the head  and neck  cancer  population.  The 
secondary objective is to assess the concordance based on SSTR PET/CT with and without FDG PET/CT outcomes.  
 
 
A Student t -test will be used to assess the difference of SSTR expression between the diagnostic results (positive vs 
negative) an d Fisher’s  exact test will  be used  to assess  the association  between dichotomized  expression  (high  vs low) 
and a binary  outcome  (positive  vs negative).  The sensitivity  will be estimated  by a proportion  of true  positives  that are 
correctly identified by [CONTACT_606314]. The specificity will be estimated by a proportion of true negative that are 
correctly identified by [CONTACT_606314]. The corresponding 95% confidence intervals will be estimated based on 
binomial distributions.  
 
 
Sample Size: B ased on the two -sided t -test, a sample size of [ADDRESS_803174] 81% power to detect 0.[ADDRESS_803175] deviations 
of the SSTR expression between positive and negative outcomes (15 per group) at a 0.10 significance level. In addition, 
based on the historical data an d current literatures, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) makes up 90% of 
head and neck cancers. For primary tumor detection, 18F FDG PET/CT is about 96% sensitive (oral cavity only) and 
anywhere from 91% -98% accurate at detecting lymph node met astasis, with sensitivity of 67% -79%, and specificity of 
82-95%.  For detecting  recurrent  disease,  18F FDG  PET/CT  is ranged  from  83% -100%  sensitive  and 90-98%  specific.  Based 
on one -sided non -inferiority test for two correlated proportions with a concordanc e of 0.90, when the maximum 
allowable difference between these proportions that still results in non -inferiority (the range of non -inferiority) is 0.15,  
a sample size of 30 subjects achieves 81% power at a significance level of 0.10.

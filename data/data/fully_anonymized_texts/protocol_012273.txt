Page:  [ADDRESS_1272878] s of care for kidney stone s include Extracorporeal delivery of Shock Waves for 
Lithotripsy (commonly referred to as ESWL , which is trademark of Dornier MedTech ), Ureteroscopy  
(URS) , and Percutaneous  Nephrolithotomy  (PCNL) . Each of these approaches present challenges for 
achieving  a stone free  state in the  kidney , especially  for patients with mild to moderate stone burden . The 
fragmentation of stone by [CONTACT_906679] a  high retreatment rate due to prevalence of  residual stones. 
Achieving complete removal of stones with ureteroscopy is feasible  but may require  multiple  procedures. 
For kidney stones larger than  20 mm , PCNL has been found to be both clinically effective and time 
efficient. However, the PCNL procedure  often requires clinicians with specialized training in obtain ing 
percutaneous  access to the kidney , and is more invasive (requiring the creation of up to [ADDRESS_1272879]) .  
The aim of the study is intended to collect descriptive performance data on the use of the M ONARCH ™ 
Platform , Urology for robotic mini -PCNL  procedures. Data gathered from this study will be used to 
optimize the robotic platform setup and  inform training and education material for the future users. The 
MONARCH ™ Platform , Urology system  will facilitate a minimally invasive , robotically -enabled  hybrid 
procedure  called the MONARCH ™ Mini -PCNL to be performed by a single qualified professional . The 
MONARCH ™ Mini -PCNL will allow the clinician to obtain retrograde and percutaneous access to 
patient’s kidney under continuous visualization for therapeutic applications  (i.e., stone removal). 
Additional details on the procedure are included in section 4.2.  
 
2.1 Background  
The MONARCH ™ Platform , Urology  system facilitates the mini - Percutaneous  Nephrolithotomy (mini -
PCNL ) hybrid approach using the robotically assisted tools to improve procedural efficiency for removing 
kidney  stone s. The first step of the mini-PCNL  is gaining both retrograde and percutaneous access to the 
kidney.  The retrograde access is established through conventional methods and maintained with a third -party 
ureteral access sheath.  The antegrade access is achieved percutaneously with a robotically assisted needle 
guidance tool. The tool targets the tip of the ureteroscope, which is placed at a location inside the kidney chosen 
by [CONTACT_11065].  The second step is a comprehensive exploration of the renal calyceal syst em identifying all 
stones with precise robotically assisted maneuvers directed by [CONTACT_906680] a joystick controller. While visualized through the ureteroscope , the stone(s) are fragment ed using standard 
methods  (i.e., the most common being laser energy from a laser fiber inserted through a working channel in 
the ureteroscope ). The evacuat ion/extrac tion of stone fragments  and dust generated by  [CONTACT_906681]. This combination 
maintains clear visualization of the collecting system and adequate distension, without over -pressurization of 
the kidney  throughout the procedure . Additional details on the procedure are included in section 4.2.  
As noted above, various options  are available to treat patients with kidney stones. Clinicians decide the 
treatment approach based upon the patient characteristics and stone size. The American Urological 
Association (AUA) guidelines  provide the following guidance to clinicians regarding patient selection for the 
different procedures. In symptomatic patients with a total non -lower pole renal stone burden ≤ 20 mm, 
clinicians may offer ESWL or URS. In symptomatic patients with a total renal stone burden >[ADDRESS_1272880] lithotripsy (ESWL)  is the least 
invasive procedure but often requires multiple treatments and is not recommended for patients with moderate 
to larger stone burdens. Flexible  Ureterorenoscopy (URS)  is the most common retrograde procedure and is 
routinely  used in a variety of diagnostic and therapeutic indications such as ureteric and kidney stones , 
urothelial tumors and the treatment of strictures.1-3 Technological improvements in ureteroscopes  and

(Protocol No.: 2021 -URO -0001)   Rev:  C 
Page:  [ADDRESS_1272882].  
Percutaneous  Nephrolithotomy (PCNL) is generally a more effective treatment  but is more invasive as it 
requires making an incision through the patient ’s flank to directly access the  kidney . This direct  antegrade  
access to the kidney allows  the clinician to use larger devices , such as pneumatic or ultrasonic lithotripters 
with suction mechanisms , to fragment and extract the stone fragments more efficiently . Limitation s of the 
PCNL procedure include the difficulty in obtaining access to the kidney, placement and rigidity of the 
lithotrite tools and the large hole size ( 24 to 30 Fr), which contributes to complications such as bleeding.6-[ADDRESS_1272883] size requiring smaller, less efficient 
lithotrites.9,10 Retrograde access with ureteroscope and laser may be used to supplement PCNL (either 
standard or mini)  so that the percutaneous access tract can be entirely dedicated to suction (thereby

requires t wo urologists to synchronize their action s between retrograde and antegrade instruments to fragment 
and evacuate the stone.[ADDRESS_1272884] of Abbreviations and Definition of Terms

Summary of Known and Potential Risk and Benefits  
Anesthesia Risk  
There  is a potential  risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_906639].  The risks 
of anesthesia  depend  on the agents  and/or  gases  used.  The risks  of anesthesia  include  postoperative  
pain,  nausea  and vomiting,  dizziness,  drowsiness,  shivering,  liver toxicity  and/or  cardiovascular  
events  and death.  Trained  professionals  with extensive  experience  and expertise  who routinely  
administer  local  anesthesia  with conscious  sedation  to patients  requiring  multiple  procedures  will

be responsible  for the induction  and associate  monitoring  required  for this study.  
Patients will be in a modified supi[INVESTIGATOR_906640] . The modified supi[INVESTIGATOR_906641] p atient ’s flank for the mini -PCNL and the ureteroscope while  reducing potential risks 
associated with anesthesia , and to improve the fluidics support .  
In addition,  study  patients  will undergo  extensive  monitoring  throughout  the recovery  period  prior 
to discharge . 
Failure  to Remove  the Stone   
There is a risk that that the procedure  may not be able to successfully  remove  all stones , because of  
either  size, location,  or physico chemical parameters  of the  stone within  the collecting  system.  
Additional  treatment  may be required.  
Infection  
Bacteria  can at times grow  within stones and therefore  cause  a urinary  infection  and rarely  sepsis during  
stone surgery.  As a  result,  urinary  infections should be  treated  before surgery  and broad -spectrum  
antibiotics  are administered  at the start of the  operation  to minimize  the risk of  a urinary  infection.   
Radiation  
The procedure will require  multiple forms of radiation exposure in the forms of pre - and post -
operative CT scan, as well as intraoperative fluoroscopy, which are being performed per standard of 
care.  One of the risks associated with radiation exposure is cancer. The natural incidence of fatal 
cancer in the U.S. is about a 1  in 5 chance . Everyday radiation exposure from natural occurring 
background radiation (sun, radon exposure in the home) is approximately [ADDRESS_1272886] scan  commonly used fo r stone detection is approximately  3 mSv12 
and is equal to an additional year of natural background radiation.  The radiation exposure risk from 
intraoperative fluoroscopy is  during a PCNL is estimated between 1.7 -56 µSv13, which is equal to an 
additional 0.21 -6.81 days of natural background radiation.  
Ureteroscopy -specific risks :  
Risks associated  with ureteroscopy  are sepsis,  urinary  tract infection,  fever,  stricture,  mucosal  
injury,  bleeding,  ureteral  perforation,  ureteral  avulsion,  ureteral  intussusception,  thermal  injury  to 
tissue,  colic,  extravasation,  urinoma,  extrusion  of calculi.   
Percutaneous  Nephrolithotomy  (PCNL) -specific risks :  
The risks associated  with percutaneous  access  are sepsis,  bleeding,  injury  to the renal  collecting  
system,  colonic injury,  pleural  injury,  liver injury , splenic  injury,  and death.  Although  rare, potential 
risks associated with this therapeutic approach include s but are not limited  to the following : 
 
Adjacent  Tissue and Organ  Injury:  Rarely  organs  surrounding  the kidney  such as bowel,  
colon,  blood vessels,  spleen,  and liver may be injured  during  surgery  requiring  emergent  
open  surgery  or further  surgery.  The chest  cavity  is in close proximity  to the  upper  pole of 
the kidney  and can be  accidentally  entered  when accessing an  upper  pole kidney  stone  
resulting  in a pneumothorax  (or air surrounding  the lung).  This may  require  that a  small  
 PROTOCOL  Doc #:  104-[ADDRESS_1272887] -in-Human Study Protocol  – Monarch Urology  
(Protocol No.: 2021 -URO -0001)   Rev:  C 
Page:  [ADDRESS_1272888]  tube be placed  temporarily  to drain  air and fluid from  around  the lung.  Permanent  
damage to the  kidney  during  kidney  puncture  resulting  in loss of the kidney  is extremely  
rare. Damage and  perforation to the  ureter  draining the kidney  may result  in scarring  and 
obstruction  requiring  further  surgery.  
 
Excess Fluid in Retroperitoneal Space:   In the absence of obstruction, the urinary collecting 
system is a virtual cavity that needs to be distended by a fluid to allow for an endoscopic 
working space. A saline irrigation fluid is commonly used to expand the lumen of the ureter, 
pelvis and reno -calyceal system. In the absence of  a fluid management device there is a risk 
of over -pressure and extravasation of fluid in the retroperitoneal space, with possible ileus, 
hemodilution by [CONTACT_725691], fluid overload with cardiac and  metabolic changes.14  
 
The MONARCH ™ Platform , Urology offers a fluid management system maintaining the 
working space throughout, without collapse risk, evacuating the fragments in real time and 
preventing the risk of rupture or reabsorption related to hyper -pressure from the fluid media.   
 
Bleeding:  Blood  loss during  PCNL  using  a single  tract is generally  low to moderate , and 
risk of blood transfusion  ranges  from  2-12%,  depending  on stone  size, location,  and number  
of tracts  dilated.15,16 
 
Additional:   Additional  procedural  risks relate  to the creation  of the percutaneous  tract and 
control  of fluid turn-over within the kidney.  The occurrence  of these  risks  is extremely  
low. Prior to the procedure,  all patients  will be questioned  about  tendency  to bleed  prior  to 
procedure  as per standard  care.  Additionally, a nticoagulation  with antiplatelet  agents  will be 
held according  to guideline  recommendations  for that drug.  If bleeding  occurs,  patients will 
be treated  with direct  pressure,  local  instillation of  epi[INVESTIGATOR_906642].  
Mechanical or Thermal Injuries  
Some potential risks may exist related to m echanical or thermal injuries resulting from physical 
maneuvers or various energy sources ( e.g., shock, suction, electricity, ultrasound, laser ). While these 
risks are small , they include:  
Upper urinary system  risks , including : Various  grades  ureteral  injury  leading  to perforation,

Risk Mitigation  
The study  protocol  was developed  with investigators  that are well-known  in the area of endo -urology.  The 
site was chosen  because  of proven  expertise  in the field of endo -urology.  All investigators  performing  
the procedure  using  the MONARCH ™ Platform , Urology system under  the clinical  protocol  will 
undergo  a Training  Program,  which includes elements  of both  a didactic and hands -on training  program.  
Proficiency  must  be demonstrated  prior  to use in humans.  Pre-clinical  and benchtop  testing  have been 
performed  in order  to optimize  the device  safety  and function.  
 
To mitigate  risks during the  procedure,  patients’  ECG,  heart  rate, blood  pressure,  and blood  oxygen  are 
continuously  monitored  by a nurse,  respi[INVESTIGATOR_77538],  and physician  during  the procedure.  If there  
is any sign of a worsening  in status,  such as elevated  heart  rate, low oxygen,  or ECG  changes,  the 
procedure  will be aborted.  In the event  that any of these  were  to occur,  the study  subject  will be  
treated  for the  condition.  
 
Postoperative oversight:  Patient discharge criteria and post -operative instructions will follow local 
policies and scientific guidelines for stand ard of care following a kidney stone removal procedure. 
Additionally, p atients will be evaluated for fluid balance by [CONTACT_38829]’s pre - and post -
operative weight and fluids used during the procedure.  
 
 
Research -only risks  
Every effort will be made to protect the privacy of the research subjects. All information and data related 
to this study will be maintained in secured, protected space, and access will be restricted to study 
personnel only. In addition to this, additional  procedure time may be encountered due to the set up for 
robot -assisted kidney stone removal procedure or for managing potential periprocedural adverse events.  
 
 
Benefits  
There are several potential benefits of using the MONARCH ™ Platform , Urology to perform the mini -
PCNL procedure. The robotically enabled  tools included in the platform will facilitate safe and efficient 
access to the kidneys, enhance visualization during the procedure and reduce potential risks to patients 
through fluid controls and patient position.  The M ONARCH ™ Platform , Urology will also make it 
possible for the procedure to be completed by a single user and improve clinician experience through the 
ergonomic  joystick controller compared to manipulating a flexible ureteroscope and positioning laser 
fiber at the same time .

Description of the study procedure: Mini -PCNL   
This robotically enabled  hybrid procedure called the MONARCH ™ Mini-PCNL will allow the clinician to 
obtain retrograde and percutaneous access to patient’s kidney under continuous visualization for therapeutic 
applications  (i.e., stone removal).  The aim of the study  is to evaluate  clinical  safety  and procedural 
effectiveness  of the robotic -assisted  diagnostic and therapeutic procedures performed  with the MONARCH ™ 
Platform , Urology.  The procedure includes the following components.  
 
Retrograde Access :  The user gains retrograde access to the kidney via conventional cystoscopy techniques and 
places a ureteral access sheath to maintain access to the kidney.  
 
Ureteroscopic Surveillance :  The user manually inserts and navigates the ureteroscope to the kidney under 
direct endoscopic visualization. Once the user confirms access to the kidney, the ureteroscope is docked  to the 
arm IDM. The physician can command insertion/retraction, articulation, and roll of the ureteroscope via the 
MONARCH ™ Controller to survey the kidney and locate the stone.  
 
Percutaneous Access :  The use of electromagnetic (EM) sensing capabilities provides a rendezvous point with 
the ureteroscope to guide the advancement of the needle into the kidney under direct visualization and control 
by [CONTACT_099]. The EM field generator and mount are pres ent on the electromechanical arm by [CONTACT_102]’s 
flank to create the EM field. The user determines which calyx to access and parks the ureteroscope in this calyx. 
the system creates a virtual target for needle alignment using the ureteroscope’s location a nd orientation and 
the tower graphical user interface displays trajectory information. Upon gaining access to the kidney, the user 
will dilate the tract with the M ONARCH ™ Percutaneous Access Sheath and Dilator set.   
 
Lithotripsy & Removal :  The user will proceed with a combined percutaneous and retrograde approach. A laser 
fiber inserted through the working channel of the ureteroscope  will be used to lase the  stone,  while  the 
MONARCH ™ mini-PCNL  Suction  Catheter  uses suction  from  the MONARCH ™ Fluidics  Pump  to stabilize  
the stone  and aspi[INVESTIGATOR_906644].  The fluidics tower regulates irrigation and aspi[INVESTIGATOR_906645], irrigating through the sheath and aspi[INVESTIGATOR_906646]. Irrigation is used to distend the kidney 
for visualization through the ureteroscope , while aspi[INVESTIGATOR_906647] . Additionally, the sheath is designed to have a second annular lumen 
to allow for passive outflow of fluid from the kidney to prevent over -pressurization of the kidney. Within this 
study, investigators will use the M ONARCH ™ mini-PCNL Suction Catheter as the primary method for stone 
and stone fragment removal, with secondary options (e .g., M ONARCH ™ Stone Retrieval Basket or off -the-
shelf devices) available if medically necessary .  When  the physician  believes  the kidney  is stone  free, 
conventional  closure  techniques  may be used for both antegrade  and retrograde  access  points .   
 
Throughout the procedure, investigators will be required to use M ONARCH ™ instrument s and accessor ies. 
Alternative off -the-shelf devices may be used in place of the expected  MONARCH ™ instrument or accessory 
device in the event continuing with the surgical workflow is not possible without the alternative device , or it 
is medically deemed to be in the best interest of the patient . 
 
Sample  size 
The study  will enroll  up to 20 patients.  The enrollment is expected to  take up to  16 weeks . The total duration  
of the study  is expected to be  up to  21 weeks .

In addition,  subjects  will be excluded  from  participating  in this Study  if any of the following  exclusion  
criteria  occur during  the endoscopic  procedure . 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Criteria identified intraoperatively to justify patient exclusion, will be reviewed by [CONTACT_1034], and 
considered for articulation directly  in the protocol for future cases to ensure consistency in exclusion .  
 
6. Treatment of subjects  
The M ONARCH ™ Platform , Urology and its accessories are intended to access and visualize 
anatomical locations within the urinary tract and interior of the kidney for diagnostic and therapeutic 
procedures via transurethral or transurethral in conjunction with percutaneous access route s. The use 
of this device to treat kidney  stones is previously  described in this protocol  in Section 4.3 . 
 
7. Assessment  of Endpoints  
 
Primary  Endpoint  
The primary  endpoint  is the successful completion  of the robotic -assisted  kidney stone  removal procedures 
including:  
• Gain ing safe concomitant  (i.e., retrograde and antegrade) access to the upper urinary tract  
• Locat ing and visualiz ing the kidney stones  
• Enabling fragmentation of stones by [CONTACT_906677]  
• Evacuating stone fragments and dust  
 
The above bulleted device endpoints will be assessed regardless of procedural outcome (e.g., evacuation of 
stone fragments and dust may still be achieved by [CONTACT_906690]).

8.1 Adverse  Events  
All adverse  events  (AE)  and serious  adverse  events  (SAE)  will be monitored  once patient is enrolled 
through  the end of follow -up. 
An AE is defined  as any undesirable  clinical  occurrence  in a patient  whether  or not it is considered  
to be device related.  In addition,  the definition of  AE applies  to any  event  with an onset  post study  
procedure  or to any underlying  diseases,  present  at baseline,  that exacerbate  in severity  post 
study  procedure.  Therefore,  an underlying  disease  that was present  at the time of enrollment  is not 
reported  as an AE, but any increase  in the severity  of the underlying  disease  is to be reported  as an 
AE. All reported  AEs must  be recorded  in the database.  A description  of the event,  including  the 
start date,  resolution  date,  action  taken,  and the outcome  should  be provided,  along  with the 
Investigator’s  assessment  of the relationship  between  the AE, the study  treatment,  and the study  
procedure.  
The following  definitions for  rating  severity  of adverse  events will be  used:  
 
Mild:  Awareness  of signs  or symptoms,  but easily  tolerated;  are of minor  irritant  type;  
causing  no loss of time from  normal  activities;  symptoms  would  not require  
medication  or a medical  evaluation;  signs  or symptoms  are transient.  
Moderate:  Interferes  with the subject’s  usual  activity  and/or  requires  symptomatic  treatment.  
Severe:  Symptom(s)  causing  severe  discomfort  and significant  impact  of the subject’s  usual  
activity  and requires  treatment.  
A serious  adverse  event  (SAE) is defined  as an event which leads  to any of the following : 
• Death  
• Life-threatening  illness or injury  
• A permanent impairment of a body structure or a body function  
• Requires  in-patient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_707]  
• Resulted in medical or surgical intervention to prevent life -threatening illness or injury or 
permanent impairment to a body structure or a body function   
• Led to a fetal distress, fetal death, or a congenital abnormality or birth defect

CONFIDENTIAL, PROPRIETORY OF AURIS HEALTH, INC   
Each AE will be evaluated on its relatedness (Not Related, Possible, Probably, Causal) to both the 
study device and study procedure, according to the following definitions:   
 
• Not related:  Relationship to the device or procedure can be excluded when:  
o the event has no temporal relationship with the use of the investigational device, or the 
procedures related to application of the investigational device;  
o the adverse event does not follow a known response pattern to the medical device (if the 
response pattern is previously known) and is biologically implausible;  
o the discontinuation of medical device application or the reduction of the level of 
activation/exposure - when clinically feasible -  
o and reintroduction of its use (or increase of the level of activation/exposure), do es not 
impact on the adverse event;  
o the event involves a body -site or an organ that cannot be affected by [CONTACT_10398];  
o the adverse event can be attributed to another cause (e.g. an underlying or concurrent 
illness/ clinical condition, an effect of another device, drug, treatment or other risk 
factors);  
o Harms to the subject are not clearly due to use error; or  
 
In order to establish the non -relatedness, not all the criteria listed above might be met at the 
same time, depending on the type of device/procedure and the adverse event.  
 
• Possible : The relationship with the use of the investigational device or comparator, or the 
relationship with procedures, is weak but cannot be ruled out completely. Alternative causes are 
also possible (e.g. an underlying or concurrent illness/ clinical condition o r/and an effect of another 
device, drug or treatment). Cases where relatedness cannot be assessed, or no information has been 
obtained should also be classified as possible.  
 
• Probable:  The relationship with the use of the investigational device or comparator, or the 
relationship with procedures, seems relevant and/or the event cannot be reasonably explained by 
[CONTACT_5748].  
 
• Causal:  The serious adverse event is associated with the investigational device, comparator or 
with procedures beyond reasonable doubt when : 
o The event is a known side effect of the product category the device belongs to or of similar 
devices and procedures;  
o The event has a temporal relationship with the device uses/application or procedures;  
o The event involves a body -site or organ that:  
▪ The device or procedures are applied to or is adjacent to;  
▪ The device or procedures have an effect on;  
o The event follows a known response pattern to the medical device (if the response pattern 
is previously known);  
o The discontinuation of medical device application (or reduction of the level of 
activation/exposure) and reintroduction of its use (or increase of the level of 
activation/exposure), impact on the event (when clinically feasible);  
o Other possible causes (e.g. an underlying or concurrent illness/clinical condition and/or 
 PROTOCOL  Doc #:  104-[ADDRESS_1272918] -in-Human Study Protocol  – Monarch Urology  
(Protocol No.: 2021 -URO -0001)   Rev:  C 
Page:  [ADDRESS_1272919] of another device, drug, or treatment) have been adequately ruled out;  
o Harm to the subject is due to error in use  
 
In order to establish the relatedness, not all the criteria listed above might be met at the same time, 
depending on the type of device/procedures and the serious adverse event.  
 
An adverse  event  is considered  to be non-device -related and non -procedure -related  when,  in the 
judgment  of the Investigator,  it is reasonable  to believe  that the event  is neither associated with 
the use of the MONARCH ™ Platform , Urology  nor the study procedure  (other products, surgical 
techniques, or medications required specifically for the procedure).  Examples of these non-device -
related and non -procedure related Adverse Events are related to concomitant medications (e.g. 
bleeding  associated  with anticoagulation  medication)  or a subject’s pre -existing condition . Pre-
existing  conditions that  are aggravated  or become  more  severe  during  or after the procedure  should  
be evaluated  on a case-by-case basis to determine if the  event may be more appropriately  classified 
as device -related or procedure -related.

Investigator  in determining  potential reportability  to the  FDA  and other  regulatory  authorities as an 
Unanticipated  Adverse  Device Effect  (UADE).  
The Investigator  should  follow  all unresolved  serious  adverse  events  until the events  are resolved  
or stabilize , the subject  is lost to follow -up, the subject  has withdrawn  consent,  or the adverse  event  is 
otherwise  explained.  
For purposes  of this study,  the following  events  are not likely  to be device -specific  adverse  events,  since  
they are known  procedure/anesthesia  related  adverse  events :  
• Any pre-planned  surgical  procedures  
• Urethral false passage and long -term urethral stricture  
• Various  grades  ureteral  injury  leading  to perforation,  avulsion, intussusception,  and long-term

This listing  of events  is intended  to provide  guidance  to the investigational  the site for purposes  of 
adverse  event  reporting.  The Investigator  at the investigational  site should  utilize  his/her  own 
clinical  judgment  in evaluating  adverse  experiences  and may decide  that the above  events  should  be 
reported  as device -specific adverse events.  
 
8.2 General  Reporting Requirements  (Serious  & Non-Serious  Adverse  Events)  
All adverse  events  must  be recorded  on the Adverse  Event  CRF  by [CONTACT_737]  (or designee).  
The report  should  include:  severity,  duration,  action  taken,  treatment  outcome  and relationship  of the 
adverse  experience  to the study  device,  procedure,  concomitant  medications,  pre-existing  
condition,  etc. (i.e., unrelated,  related  or relationship  unknown).  The investigative site will report non-
serious adverse events  into the electronic clinical database within 1 week after they become aware  of 
the non -serious adverse event.  
In the case of serious  adverse  events , procedure  and/or  device  observations  and malfunctions,  
de-identified medical  record  documentation  (e.g. procedure  notes,  operative  notes,  discharge  
summary,  relevant  progress  notes,  imaging  or lab studies)  must  be provided  to study  sponsor or its 
designee.   
The following  criteria  must  also be adhered  to by [CONTACT_906692]:  
• The Adverse Event  CRF  must be  signed  by [CONTACT_906693]-Investigator.  
• It is the responsibility  of the Investigator  to inform  their IRB of serious  adverse  events  as required  
by [CONTACT_906694].

8.3 Device  Failures  and Malfunctions  
Observations,  malfunctions,  or failures  of the MONARCH ™ Platform , Urology  will be documented  
in the appropriate fields within the CRFs, and supplemented with data collected in an engineering 
Case Observer survey (103-001018 -00). Device failures  and malfunctions  should also be documented  
in the  patient’s  medical record.  
NOTE:   Device  failures  or malfunctions  are NOT  to be reported  as adverse  events.  However,  if there  
is an adverse  event  that results  from  a device  failure  or malfunction,  that specific  a d v e r s e  
event  would be recorded  in the  manner noted in Section 8.2) .

9. Statistical Methods  
 The Sponsor will be responsible for the analysis of data from this protocol. A detailed Statistical 
Analysis Plan (SAP) will be written and approved prior to final database lock. The SAP will describe 
all planned analyses based on the statistical design o f this study and the subsequent data collected. A 
brief overview of key statistical analyses is provided below . 
 
9.1 Interval Windows  
Interval windows for the purpose of analysis in this study will not be defined outside of those already 
specified in the protocol for visit scheduling. The final visit occurs approximately 30 days after surgery, 
thus no interval windows need to be defined given the absence of long -term follow -up in this study. The 
Schedule of Assessments specifies a window of 7 days around the scheduling of the 30 -day follow -up 
visit, and any information entered in the eCRFs at this visit will correspond to the 30 -day visit . There will 
be no assigning of observations to time points outside of the visit to which they are recorded in the eCRFs.  
 
9.2 Levels of Significance  
No hypotheses are specified for this study and no p -values are being calculated, therefore no level of 
significance is specified. All estimation of endpoints will be performed using 95% confidence intervals.  
 
9.3 Analysis Sets  
The summary of all performance and safety endpoints will be performed on the set of subjects in whom 
the  M ONARCH ™ Platform, Urology  is utilized during the surgical procedure.  
 
9.4 Sample Size Justification  
No formal hypothesis is being tested in this study;  thus,  the sample size was not statistically sized, but 
rather is considered sufficient for an initial descriptive summary of performance and safety endpoints in 
a feasibility study.

The Investigator  will maintain  all essential  Study  documents  and source  documentation,  in original  format,  
that support  the data collected  on the study  patients  in compliance  with the ICH/GCP  guidelines.  Documents  
must  be retained  for at least [ADDRESS_1272928].  These  
documents  will be retained  for a longer  period  of time by [CONTACT_906697].  When  these  documents  no longer  need to be maintained,  it is Sponsor  
’s responsibility  to inform  the Investigator.  The Investigator  will take measures  to ensure  that these  essential  
documents  are not accidentally  damaged  or destroyed.  If for any reason  the Investigator  withdraws  
responsibility  for maintaining  these  essential  documents,  custody  must  be transferred  to an individual  who 
will assume  responsibility.  Sponsor  must  receive written  notification of  this custodial change.  
 
11. Quality  Control  and Quality  Assurance  
Site Training  
To ensure  accurate,  complete,  and reliable  data,  the Sponsor  or its representatives  will provide  
instructional  material  to the Study  sites site as appropriate;   
• Instruct  the Investigators  and Study  personnel  on the protocol,  the completion  of the CRFs,  and Study  
procedures  
• Communicate  regularly  with site  personnel  via mail, email,  telephone,  and/or fax 
• Make visits to the Study  site  
During  those  visits,  the sponsor’s  designee  will monitor  the subject  data recorded  in the CRFs  against  
source documents at the Study  site. 
 
Physician  Training  
Prior  to enrolling subjects  in the Study,  investigators  will be provided  didactic  and hands -on training in a 
simulated clinical environment on the procedural  steps  required  to use the MONARCH ™ Platform , 
Urology .

are to be audited  or inspected  by [CONTACT_906698].  The Sponsor or  the Sponsor’s  designee  will also 
inform  the site if they are made  aware  of a pending  audit  or inspection  by a regulatory  agency.  No FDA  
inspections  are expected  to be associated  with this Study.  
 
Amending  the Protocol  
An Investigator  may not make  protocol  changes  without  prior  approval  by [CONTACT_2728].  All significant  protocol  
changes  that may affect  the following  must  be submitted  and approved  by [CONTACT_906699]:  
• validity  of the data or information  resulting  from  the completion  of the approved  protocol;  
• relationship  of the  likely  subject  risk to benefit  relied upon to approve the protocol;  
• scientific soundness  of the  investigational  plan,  or; 
• rights,  safety,  or welfare  of the  human subjects  involved in the investigation.  
Sponsor  will submit  a copy  of the protocol  amendment  to the Investigator  for his/her IRB to review.  The 
 PROTOCOL  Doc #:  104-[ADDRESS_1272929] -in-Human Study Protocol  – Monarch Urology  
(Protocol No.: 2021 -URO -0001)   Rev:  C 
Page:  [ADDRESS_1272930]  in an emergency.  
Such  approval  shall be documented  in writing  and maintained  in clinical  study  management  and 
Investigator  files.  Prior  approval  is generally  not expected  in situations  where  unforeseen  circumstances  
are beyond  the Investigator’s  control,  (e.g., subject  was not available  for scheduled  follow -up office  visit,  
blood  sample  lost by [CONTACT_13754],  etc.);  however,  the event  is still considered  a deviation  and will be 
reported  via the  appropriate  CRF.  
Deviations  must  be reported  to Sponsor  regardless  of whether  medically  justifiable,  pre-approved  by 
[CONTACT_906700].  Subject  specific  deviations  will be reported  
on the Protocol  Deviation  case report  form.  Non-subject  specific  deviations,  (e.g., unauthorized  use of 
an, MONARCH ™ Platform , Urology  device  outside  the study,  unauthorized  use of a MONARCH ™ 
Platform , Urology  device  by a physician  who has not signed  an Investigator  agreement  or not been trained  
in the use of the device,  etc.),  will be reported  to Sponsor  reported  via the appropriate  CRF.  Investigators  
will also adhere  to procedures  for reporting  study  deviations  to their IRB in accordance with their specific 
IRB reporting  policies and procedures.  
Regulations  require  that Investigators  maintain  accurate,  complete,  and current  records,  including  
documents  showing  the dates  of and reasons  for each deviation  from  the protocol.  For reporting  purposes,  
Sponsor  classifies  study  deviations as major  and minor:  
Major  deviation  (at a minimum) : Any deviation  from  subject  inclusion  and exclusion  criteria,  subject  
informed  consent  procedures , unauthorized  device  use, or which impacts the analysis of the primary endpoint  
or scientific integrity of the study . 
Minor  deviation : Deviation  from  a protocol  requirement  such as incomplete/inadequate  subject  testing  
procedures,  follow -ups performed  outside  specified  time windows,  etc. Minor  Deviations  that continue  
to occur  at an investigational  site may be classified  as Major  Deviations  if corrective  action  is not 
taken  to secure  future  compliance  to the protocol.  
 
Confidentiality  
Confidentiality  of subjects  will be maintained  throughout  the Study.  A unique  identification  code will 
be assigned  to each subject  participating  in this Study.  Any data that may be published  in abstracts,

it is widely  used throughout surgery for grading adverse events (i.e. complications) , which occur as a 
result of surgical procedures .a   
Clavien -Dindo consists of 7 grades (I, II, IIIa, IIIb, IVa, IVb  and V). The introduction of the subclasses 
a and b allows a contraction of the classification into 5 grades (I, II, III, IV and V) depending on the 
size of the population observed or the of the focus of a study.  
 
Complications that have the potential for long -lasting disability after patient’s discharge (e.g.: paralysis 
of a voice cord after thyroid surgery) are highlighted in the present classification by a suffix (“d” for 
disability). This suffix indicates that a  follow -up is required to comprehensively evaluate the outcome 
and related long -term quality of life.  
 
Grades  Definition  
Grade I  Any deviation from the normal postoperative course without the need for 
pharmacological treatment or surgical, endoscopic,  and radiological interventions.  
Allowed therapeutic regimens are: drugs as antiemetics, antipyretics, analgesics, 
diuretics and electrolytes and physiotherapy. This grade also includes wound 
infections opened at the bedside.  
Grade II  Requiring pharmacological treatment with drugs other than such allowed for grade I 
complications.  Blood transfusions and total parenteral nutrition are also included.  
Grade III  Requiring surgical, endoscopic,  or radiological intervention  
       - IIIa Intervention not under general anesthesia  
       - IIIb Intervention under general anesthesia  
Grade IV  Life-threatening complication (including CNS complications)* requiring IC/ICU -
management  
       - IVa single organ dysfunction (including dialysis)  
       - IVb Multiorgan dysfunction  
Grade V  Death of a patient  
 *brain hemorrhage, ischemic stroke, subarrachnoidal bleeding, but excluding transient ischemic attacks 
(TIA); IC: Intermediate care; ICU: Intensive care unit.

Introduction  
Purpose  
The goal of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a brief, intensive 1 -day psychotherapy 
group intervention (Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, ACT), compared to a 12 week time 
control group on anxiety symptoms, vascular function, inflammation, muscle sympathetic nerve 
activity (mSNA), and oxidant stress.  Individuals who are interested in the study will be 
identified by [CONTACT_684972]; 
advertisements, flyers and mass emails will direct individuals to the online screening survey.  
Those deemed eligible to participate will be randomized to the ACT intervention or the control 
group. Asse ssments of anxiety symptoms (via various surveys) and vascular function (via non -
invasive, well -established techniques) will be performed at baseline and [ADDRESS_928252] group session.  After 12 weeks, anxiety and vascular 
assessments will be repeated to re -evaluate severity of anxiety symptoms, vascular function, 
inflammation, and oxidant stress.  
Research Question and Hyp othesis  
We hypothesize that reducing the burden of anxiety symptoms using Acceptance and 
Commitment Therapy (ACT) will improve vascular function, inflammation, mSNA, and oxidant 
stress.  If our hypothesis is correct, then we predict that: 1) Vascular funct ion, inflammation, 
muscle sympathetic nerve activity (mSNA), and oxidant stress will be elevated in individuals 
with anxiety compared to those with low or no anxiety, 2) ACT will improve forearm blood flow 
during reactive hyperemia; 3) ACT will decrease mS NA; 4) ACT will improve microvascular, 
including retinal vascular, and large elastic artery function per pulse wave velocity (PWV) 
measurements and 5) ACT will improve autonomic function measured by [ADDRESS_928253]  at

Safety Assessment  
Physical Risks  
 Fasting 8 hours: The most common risk when fasting is deh ydration, therefore the subject 
will be encouraged to drink plenty of water. Subjects may experience hunger and 
irritability and if they experience fainting, nausea, or vomiting they will be instructed to 
stop fasting.  
 Blood Sample: Potential risks associated with obtaining blood samples are minimal but 
include slight bruising, pain, a temporary feeling of faintness, and/or a small risk of 
infection.   All blood draws will be performed by [CONTACT_263533], nurse or research team 
member trained and certified in drawing blood.  There are no known risks associated with 
urine collection.  
 Endothelial Cell Collection: The risks related to the venous endothelial cell collection do 
not appear to be any greater than those associated with the placement of an intravenou s 
catheter into antecubital vein.   In the Co -Investigator's experience ([CONTACT_301745][INVESTIGATOR_835]) with 
this technique at the University of Colorado Clinical and Translational Research Center, 
there were no adverse events encountered in >150 of these procedures perf ormed 
between 2005 -2009 in young, middle -aged and older healthy adults . 
 Venous Occlusion Plethysmography (VOP): There are no known risks associated with 
the strain gauge device or with temporary changes in blood flow using a blood pressure 
cuff.  Minor dis comfort in the forearm and/or hand may occur when the blood pressure 
cuffs are inflated .  This feeling is completely reversed within several minutes after the 
cuff is released with no permanent discomfort.  
 Pulse Wave Analysis: There are no known or foresee able risks associated with the use of 
applanation tonometry for pulse wave analysis.   ECG  electrodes may cause minor 
irritation to the skin.  
 Carotid Artery Compliance: There are no known or foreseeable risks associated with the 
use of carotid echocardiogra phy.  ECG electrodes may  cause minor irritation to the skin.  
 Non-invasive Blood Pressure Monitoring: There are no known risks associated with the 
use of a small cuff on your finger to monitor small  changes in blood pressure.  
 Antihypertensive Medication Wit hdrawal: There is an increase in cardiovascular diseases 
such as strokes, heart failure, aortic aneurysms, and  pulmonary embolism when these 
medications are stopped for longer periods of time than in this study.   Subjects will be 
asked to bring  medications  with them to experimental Visits 2 and 4 to resume 
medication use once experimental testing is complete.  We do encourage subjects  to 
discuss holding medication dosages with their personal physician before doing so.  
 Retinal Vascular Measurements: Since th e subjects may be dilated with 0.5% tropi[INVESTIGATOR_684960] a risk in patients with angle closure  glaucoma if they have not had a 
procedure to correct this.  Patients at the UIHC eye clinic usually have a corrective 
procedure done as a  preventative me asure.  If there is a question about angle closure 
glaucoma, we will do a slit lamp exam to rule this out before proceeding.   Dilating drops 
may also cause an initial burning or stinging sensation that goes away after installation.  
There is a small risk o f sensitivity or an  allergic reaction that would cause redness or 
irritation.  The dilating drops will temporarily affect close vision (reading distance) for 2 
to 6 hours,  if they do not normally use a reading correction.  Some people may be 
uncomfortable driving during this time.  Also, the sun and bright  lights may cause some 
discomfort, but sun shades are provided if desired.  Occasional temporary stinging, 
burning and conjunctival redness may  occur with the use of 0.5% p roparacaine.  
 Microneurography: Direct recording of nerve activity (microneurography) has a very 
small degree of risk.  Over 2,[ADDRESS_928272] been no si gnificant 
complications.  Approximately 7%  of subjects experience minor tingling in the leg, foot 
or arm for a few days after the study, but these symptoms have been transient.  In the 
mental  math test, the subject may become frustrated and in the cold pre ssor test, the 
subject may feel uncomfortable, however there are no known  physical risks associated 
with these tests.  The subject may experience discomfort at the site of microneurography 
following the study visit, and  discomfort becomes more likely if th ey engage in high -
intensity exercise with their legs (e.g. leg press, running, cycling, etc.), particularly  within 
[ADDRESS_928273]. Fiedorowicz.  
 24-hour Ambulatory Blood Pressure: Participant s may experience abrasions, petechiae, 
or bruising from the pressure exerted when the cuff  inflates, particularly if s/he is taking 
anticoagulants.   Cuff inflation may cause mild discomfort and/or may be disruptive to 
sleep.  
 Fatigue may set in during the 6  hour group workshop.  
Minimizing Risks  
 All IV insertion, blood draws, and microneurography techniques will be performed by 
[CONTACT_263533], nurse or trained research team member.  
 During experimental testing (VOP) the subject will relay any discomfort to research  staff 
and will be reminded they can elect to stop testing if discomfort becomes intolerable.  
 Answers to questionnaires are confidential and the participant is able to skip any question 
they are not comfortable answering.  To ensure confidentiality, a stud y number assigned 
at the beginning of the study will identify materials containing patient information.  All 
study materials and consent forms will be kept in locked files stored in an office that will 
also be locked. Confidentiality among subjects will al so emphasized at the group 
workshop.  
 Some questions on the various health surveys or questionnaires may include questions 
about depressed mood or thoughts of suicide. To address this risk, we will provide the 
following information to all individuals who co mplete the online pre -screen:  
"Thank you for completing our survey, which included questions about depression and anxiety.

Information, referral and crisis intervention service for the State of Iowa. Operates 24 hours a 
day. Can be reached by [CONTACT_93596] 2 -1-1 in IA."  
 Once the subject is enrolled in the study, if these or other questions on other he alth forms 
or during the MINI lead to a concern for the participant's safety or the safety of others, 
the PI [INVESTIGATOR_684961] a risk assessment.  The participant 
will be kept informed of the need for additional evaluation and w ill be encouraged to ask 
questions.  If the participant is deemed a safety risk by [CONTACT_978], the participant's primary 
psychiatrist will be notified.  If the participant does not have a primary psychiatrist or if 
the primary psychiatrist cannot be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530],  we will arrange for an evaluation in the 
UIHC Emergency Room or Adult Psychiatry Clinic.  
 Regular breaks are given during the workshop to reduce fatigue.  
 Retinal Vascular Measurements: Patients at risk for angle closure glaucoma who are seen 
at the UIHC ey e clinic routinely have a corrective procedure done to prevent epi[INVESTIGATOR_684962] (high IOP) that can result when dilated.  If there is a question 
about angle closure glaucoma, we will do a slit lamp exam to rule this out before 
proceedi ng.  We will tell subjects before we put the drops in that they may cause a 
stinging or burning sensation that will go away.  We will ask subjects if they have had a 
reaction to dilating drops in the past.   Side effects of the tropi[INVESTIGATOR_684963].  We will ask subjects if they have had any prior reaction to 
proparacaine.  The burning or redness usually subside in a few minutes.  All eye drops 
used in the study are routine eye drops used in the eye clinic at UIHCS.  We will provide 
subjects with disposable sunglasses to add additional comfort from the light.  
Experimental Methods  
1) Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI):  
The MINI was designed as a brief structured interview for the major Axis I psychiatric 
disorders in DSM -IV and ICD -10.  Validation and reliability studies have been done 
comparing the MINI to the SCID -P for DSM -III-R and the CIDI (a structured interview 
developed by [CONTACT_38375]).  The results of these studies show that the 
MINI has similar reliability and validity properties, but can be administered in a much 
shorter period of time (mean 18.7 +/ - 11.6 minutes, median 15 minutes) than the above 
referenced instruments.  It can be used by [CONTACT_15098], after a brief training sess ion.  At Visit 1, 
[CONTACT_684988] or another trained interviewer will perform the interview with the subject.  
This interview will be more structured than usual, with very precise questions about 
psychological problems which require a yes or no answer by t he subject.   
2) Primary Endothelial Cell Protein Expression:  
Endothelial cells will be collected from an antecubital vein, washed, isolated to slides, and 
stained with primary and secondary (immunofluorescence) antibodies for quantification of: 
ACE (Abcam), AT1 receptor (Abcam), Ang II (Novus), Aldo (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_835]), nitrotyrosine 
(Abcam), NADPH oxidase p47phox (Abcam), Nox4 and Nox2 (Abcam).  Briefly, under 
sterile conditi ons, a CRU nurse will insert an 18G catheter into an antecubital vein.  [CONTACT_684989][INVESTIGATOR_835] (with CRU nurse assisting) will insert a 0.[ADDRESS_928274]. Jude 3 mm 
flexible guide J -wire (Daig Corp., Minnetonka, MN) 3 -4 cm into catheter, then retracted  2-3 
times from catheter.  The distal portion of the wire is clipped off and then transferred to a 50 
ml conical tube containing a buffer solution.  Cells are then taken to the PIs lab (522 
Fieldhouse) and cells are recovered by [CONTACT_7891], fixed to po ly-lysine slides with 
formaldehyde, and then  frozen at -80C until analysis.  After blocking non -specific binding 
sites with 5% donkey serum (Jackson Immunoresearch), cells will be incubated with 
monoclonal antibodies for proteins of interest and a spec ific AlexaFlour488 -conjugated 
secondary antibody (Research Diagnostics).  Slides are then cover slipped with a 
VECTASHIELD DAPI (4', 6’ diamidino -2-phenylindol hydrochloride) fluorescent mounting 
medium (Vector Labs) and stored at 4C overnight.  Slides are  viewed using a fluorescence 
microscope (Eclipse 600, Nikon) and 20 individual endothelial cell images are digitally 
captured by a digital camera (Weiss).  These endothelial cells are documented by [CONTACT_684977] [INVESTIGATOR_23053].  Once endothelial cells 
with intact nuclei are identified, they were analyzed using Image J (NIH, Bethesda, MD) to 
quantify the intensity of primary antibody -dependent AlexaFlour488 staining (i.e. average 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_215431]).  The number of ce lls typi[INVESTIGATOR_684964] 50 -100 cells per slide.  Eight slides and one control cultured human aortic 
endothelial cell (HAEC: passage 3 -6 processed identically to the sample cells) slides are 
selected for each st aining batch.  Values are reported as a ratio of sample endothelial cells to 
HAEC average pi[INVESTIGATOR_684965].  
3) Blood Sample:  
Oxidized LDL (a marker of lipoprotein oxidation 65), TNF -alpha and IL -6 wil l be measured 
by [CONTACT_6428] (ALPCO) by [CONTACT_15957] -I’s lab.  Standard blood chemistries will be determined  by [CONTACT_86677][INVESTIGATOR_684966].  
4) Venous O cclusion Plethysmography (VOP):  
Venous occlusion plethysmography (VOP) will be used to measure forearm blood flow 
(FBF) resp onses to local ischemia to test endothelium -dependent and independent dilation of 
forearm resistance arteries.   Briefly, subjects lie supi[INVESTIGATOR_684967] 
(venous occlusion) placed around upper arms and pediatric blood pressure cuffs around  
wrists.  FBF will be measured by [CONTACT_1299] a gallium -in-silastic strain gauge around the widest 
part of the forearm which measures small changes in forearm volume during periodic 
inflation (8 sec inflated, 4 sec deflated) of upper arm cuffs to 40 mmHg (whic h temporarily 
prevents venous outflow and measures arterial inflow into forearm) and continuous wrist 
inflation of a blood pressure cuff to [ADDRESS_928275] s. 
5) Pulse Wave Velocity (PWV):  
Carotid -femoral, carotid -brachial, and carotid -radial PWV will be measured non -invasively 
by [CONTACT_651893], femoral, brachial and radial artery pressure waveforms sequentially 
with an applanation  tonometer (Non -invasive Hemodynamics Workstation, Cardiovascular 
Engineering, Inc.).   Pressure waveforms are gated to the ECG R wave in order to calculate 
the transit time (t) between the foot of the carotid and the respective peripheral (femoral, 
brachia l, radial) waveforms.  The carotid -femoral transit distance (CFTD) is estimated 
between the 2 anatomical sites as the difference between the suprasternal notch (SSN) to 
carotid (SSN -C) and femoral (SSN -F) sites.  Thus, the CFTD is calculated as CFTD= (SSN -
F) - (SSN -C) and PWV calculated as CFTD/t (*CITE 1, 2).  This approach accounts for 
parallel transmission of the pulse wave up the brachiocephalic and carotid arteries, and 
simultaneously along the aortic arch using the SSN as a fiducial point where parall el 
transmission begins (i.e. bifurcation site of aortic arch and brachiocephalic artery) .  The intra -
subject reproducibility of carotid -femoral PWV is excellent with a coefficient variation of 
2.1% for triplicate measurements on non -consecuti ve days in 7 y oung adults . 
6) Carotid Artery Compliance (CC):  
Carotid artery compliance and Beta -stiffness index will be determined noninvasively by 
[CONTACT_5019]-resolution ultrasonography (Logiq 7, GE Healthcare) of the right common carotid artery 
and contralateral assessment of carotid artery blood pressure via non -invasive carotid artery 
applanation tonometry respectively.   Carotid artery diameters are measured ~2 cm proximal 
to the carotid bulb with the transducer placed at a 90° angle to the vessel by [CONTACT_78150] -line analysis 
of DICO M images with image analysis software (Medical Imaging Applications, LLC).   
Maximal diameters (i.e. systolic expansion) and minimal diameters (i.e. diastolic relaxation) 
are measured in sync with carotid artery blood pressure waveforms.   Carotid blood pres sure 
waveforms are calibrated using diastolic and mean brachial artery blood pressure obtained 
from standard brach ial artery cuff blood pressure.  
7) 24-hour Ambulatory Blood Pressure Variability and Barorefle x Sensitivity:  
Twenty -four hour systolic blood pres sure variability will be recorded from [ADDRESS_928276] ambulatory blood pressure assessment ([ZIP_CODE] -IQ, 
Spacelabs Healthcare, Inc.).   Baroreflex  sensitivity will be determined by [CONTACT_684978] 15 minutes using beat -to-beat finger blood pressure 
(Finometer MIDI, Finopress Medical Systems).  Blood pressure variability will be calculated 
as the standard devi ation of the systolic blood pressure over 24 hours, and baroreflex 
sensitivity will be calculated using the sequence technique as pre viously described.  
8) Microneurography:  
Direct intra -neural recordings of multiunit MSNA will be obtained from the right leg 
peroneal nerve using the microneurography technique as previously described.   Briefly, a 
tungsten micro electrode (200 µm diameter shaft; 1 -5 µm uninsulated tip) will be inserted 
into the peroneal nerve posterior to the head of the fibula by a physician or research staff 
trained in microneurography.  Well -validated criteria are used to determine that a neurogram 
represents sympathetic activity to muscle or skin.  The technique has been used safely in over 
[ADDRESS_928277] frequency (bursts/minute) and 
bursts incidence (bursts/100 heartbeats).   During MSNA recordings a 3 -lead ECG, beat -by-
beat blood pressure by [CONTACT_684979], and respi[INVESTIGATOR_684968] a 
pneumobelt.   Blood flow to the arm (brachial artery) will be measured using Doppler 
ultrasound to non -invasively measure mean arterial blood velocity and diameter.   Two E4 
wristbands (one on each wrist) will  be worn by [CONTACT_684980] -invasively measure 
sympathetic activity (electrodermal response) and beat -to-beat heart rate variability 
continuously.  Also during the procedure subjects will undergo a mental math test and a cold 
pressor test.  In the m ental math test, the subject will be asked to subtract continuously the 
number 7 (or another random number) from a [ADDRESS_928278] their ha nd 
in ice water for 2 minutes.  This procedure will be used to cause transient changes in  heart 
rate and blood pressure.  
9) Retinal Vascular Measurements:  
 Visual acuity will be measured by [CONTACT_684981] r glasses or best correction.  This takes about 5 minutes or less.  
 Intraocular pressure (IOP) may be done using a tonopen.  A drop of a topi[INVESTIGATOR_684969] a numbing agent before IOP is checked.   The tonopen touches 
the surface of the cornea of the eye very briefly . This will take a few minutes.  
 Beat-by-beat blood pressure will be measured by [CONTACT_684982].   We will have 
the subjects sit quietly for a few minutes .  This will take a few minutes.  
 Ocular Coherence Tomograph y (OCT): The thickness of the optic nerve and macula will 
also be measured inside of the eye using a special camera that forms an image of the 
layers of the retina  The imaging is harmless and measures the thickness or structural 
health of retinal layers a nd optic nerve.  This image will be compared to the LSFG for 
blood vessel comparison and identification.  This test takes approximately 10 minutes.  
 Laser -Speckle Blood Flow Imaging (LSFG) with varying light stimuli.  This device uses 
a Class I laser diode.   Most subjects do not need dilation for this test, but those with 
smaller pupi[INVESTIGATOR_684970].  Subjects will be seated at the instrument and we will 
adjust the chinrest and then let the subject rest with the lights dimmed for about [ADDRESS_928279] will be repeated 
following a light stimulus given to one eye using a handheld calibrated instrument i n 
order to measure the blood flow response to activation of the retina by [CONTACT_60230].  This will 
take another 5 -10 minutes.   This will be repeated several times followed by [CONTACT_684983].   Two E4 wristbands (one on each wrist ) will be 
worn by [CONTACT_684984] -invasively measure sympathetic activity 
(electrodermal response) and beat -to-beat heart rate variability continuously.  
Statistical Analysis Methods  
Descriptive Analyses  
Descriptive summary statistics will be provided for demographic and important baseline 
characteristics.  For continuous variables, the number of patients, mean, standard deviation, 
median, minimum and maximum will be provided.  For categorical variables, t he number and 
percent of patients in each treatment arm will be summarized.  
Primary Endpoint Analysis  
Changes in our primary outcome of interest, anxiety as measured by [CONTACT_684985] 
(BAI), will be assessed using a linear mixed effect model wi th intervention group as the fixed 
effect between -subjects factor of interest and repeated measurements (baseline, 6 weeks, 12 
weeks) within -subjects of the anxiety inventory as the primary dependent variable. Individual 
participants will be initially mode led as a random effect including both an intercept term and, if 
necessary, slope. The random effect for slope will be removed for an intercept only model if the 
random slope does not substantively improve the model or if there are issues with model fitting . 
Fixed effects covariates for any sociodemographic or clinical variables that differ between 
groups despi[INVESTIGATOR_684971].  
Secondary Endpoint Analysis  
State and Trait subscales of the STAI will be secondarily modeled as the dependent variable  to 
assess changes in the domains of trait and state anxiety.  
The novel physiological variables (vascular function, mSNA, inflammation) will serve as 
secondary outcomes and will be explored in analogous to the above.  We will also assess for any 
relationsh ip between these variables and changes in anxiety across groups in linear regression 
models (since these physiological variables are only measured at two points, there is no need for 
linear mixed models).  For these latter analyses, variables for relevant sociodemographic and 
clinical confounds will need to be included as change in anxiety is not assigned by 
[CONTACT_684986].  Comparisons between the groups of higher anxiety and 
low anxiety will be made using one -way analysis of varian ce to determine differences in vascular 
function, mSNA, and inflammation.  Baseline values for the higher anxiety group will be 
compared to the values obtained from the low anxiety group during their one -time experimental 
visit.  
Sample Size  
Using the estim ating equations of Diggle et al. (2002) and based on three assessments for 
primary and secondary outcomes and a correlation of outcome measures over the duration of the 
study within individuals of 0.4, a total of [ADDRESS_928280] 
size of 0.5 SD with 80% power at an alpha=0.05 (as calculated in SAS 9.3 using relevant 
formula).  Assuming an 10% dropout rate our sample size would need to be adjusted to 38/(1 -
0.1)=43 per group using the formula from Friedman et al. (2010) .  A 0.[ADDRESS_928281].  A corresponding change of 
similar magnitude on the better studied Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (not used in this 
study) has been considered clinically si gnificant (Hegerl et al. 2012).  Similarly, we are powered 
to detect clinically significant effects for the secondary outcomes of vascular function.  We will 
assess large vessel measures (e.g. pulse wave velocity), resistance vessel measures (forearm 
blood  flow), and microvascular measures in the retina.  In a study of brachial artery flow -
mediated dilation (FMD), a reduction in FMD of 0.66 SD was associated with a 30% increased 
risk of cardiovascular events (Shimbo D et al. 2007).  Similar results were see n in another 
population -based study wherein each 0.[ADDRESS_928282] deviation in FMD was associated with an 
18% increased risk of composite cardiovascular events and 36% increase risk of myocardial 
infarction, resuscitated cardiac arrest or coronary heart disea se death (Yeboah J et al. 2009).  
Thus, we should be powered to detect clinically significant changes in vascular function.

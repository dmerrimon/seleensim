3.1 Discussion of Hepatic fibrosis and  FUEL  Trial  Extension Study  
3.1.1 FALD  
Fontan- associated liver disease (FALD) is defined as abnormalities in liver structure and 
function resulting from the abnormal circulation created by [CONTACT_715610] 
(TCPC) and not related to any other pr ocess  (1). FALD is increasingly recognized as one of the 
most common complications of the TCPC (2, 3)  and one which is universally present in patients 
with TCPC physiology (8-11). After the Fontan operation, blood from the inferior and superior 
vena cava are ro uted directly to the pulmonary arte ries by[CONTACT_715611] ( Figure 1 ). In this 
circulation, blood is not “pumped” through the lungs but is “pushed” through by [CONTACT_715612]. It is postulated that the Fontan’s elevated, non- phasic 
systemic venous pressure results in obligate chronic hepatic venous hypertension and congestion that is likely an important driver of hepatic fibrosis. As part of the injury response, activated 
myofibroblasts deposit excess extracellular matrix in the perisinusoidal space, a process which, if 
it persists, can lead to increased hepatocellular injury, progressive fibrosis, organ dysfunction, and, ultimately, to cirrhosis and hepatic failure. The congestion and fibrosis result in a wide 
spectrum of l iver disease, including synthetic dysfunction, ascites, portal hypertension, cirrhosis, 
and hepatocellular carcinoma, and may culminate in fulminant liver failure. The severity of liver 
fibrosis is known to increase with time after TCPC and occurs in the a bsence of any other 
identifiable etiology of chronic liver disease .

Version 3.0 
Final Date: December 11 , 2017 Confidential  3.1.2 Characterization of FALD  
A roadblock to understanding and treating FALD is the lack of an established, noninvasive 
means of detecting it. Basic laboratory testing (platelet count, AST, ALT, bilirubin, GGT, INR) 
and standard imaging (conventional ultrasound (US), computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)) are insensitive to liver congestion and early liver fibrosis in these 
patients  (8). Percutaneous core needle liver biopsy, while the current standard of care, is not an 
ideal surveillance tool as the core sample may falsely under - or over -estimate the degree of 
fibrosis given the significant heterogeneity that often exists. Liver biopsy is also invasive and 
carries a small but real risk of bleeding, particularly in patients who require anti -coagulation.  
Ultrasound shear wave elastography (SWE), based on the measurement of tissue shear wave speed, provides a non- invasive measure of liver stiffness and is an extremely promising 
technology to monitor the congestion and early fibrosis that precedes overt FALD. The utility of 
ultrasound SWE in assessi ng liver fibrosis has been w ell-documented (9, 10) and image -guided 
ultrasound SWE has been used in TCPC patients to demonstrate that liver stiffness correlates 
with hepatic congestion (as determined by [CONTACT_715613]) and hepatic fibrosis (as determined by [CONTACT_79939] b iopsy)  (11-13). MRI -elastography may be of even greater utility as it 
allows sampling over a much larger region of the liver (thus, minimizing sampling error) and 
may potentially allow differentiation of stiffness due to fibrosis versus congestion, a feature 
which may be particularly useful in the evaluation of Fontan patients and in determining the best approach to targeted therapy in this population ( 14). 
3.1.3 FALD and FUEL Extension  Study  
The FUEL Extension trial is an NHLBI -sponsored study that will as sess the efficacy of safety 
and efficacy of udenafil, a phosphodiesterase -5 inhibitor (PDE -5i) that causes relaxation and 
decongestion of the pulmonary and systemic venous vasculature, to improve Fontan cardiac function, peripheral endothelial function, and exercise performance in adolescents who have undergone TCPC. By [CONTACT_715614], we will have the unique 
opportunity to 1) measure liver stiffness across a large cross -section of children and adolescents 
after TCPC;  2) assess how  liver stiffness responds to vasodilator therapy determine; 3) determine 
if liver stiffness correlates with important functional outcomes; and 4) determine the relationship 
between biomarkers of heart failure and liver fibrosis and liver stiffness. Current ly, PDE -5i 
therapy after the Fontan is reserved for those patients who have clinically symptomatic heart 
failure. However, a significant and sustained reduction in liver stiffness with PDE -5i therapy 
would suggest that earlier treatment might reduce the in cidence, severity and rate of progression 
of FALD. This has important implications for a population in whom the rate of liver fibrosis is a 
critical determinant of overall long -term health.

Final Date: December [ADDRESS_974703] undergone TCPC, there has not been a large -scale evaluation that 
defines “normal” in this population or seeks to correlate liver stiffness with functional outcome.  Similarly, the impact of treatment with pulmonary vasodilators, medications that should lower systemic venous pressure, has not been evaluated.  The FUEL Extension trial presents a unique opportunity to measure liver sti ffness in those with TCPC, to evaluate the impact of udenafil on 
liver stiffness, to correlate liver stiffness with functional outcomes, and to gain valuable insight into the relationship between liver stiffness and biomarkers of heart failure and fibrosis . 
3.2.2 Rationale for Study Outcomes  
[IP_ADDRESS] The use of ultrasound SWE to evaluate liver fibrosis  
Ultrasound SWE uses one or more acoustic radiation force impulses (ARFI) or “push pulses” to generate shear waves in the tissue of interest. These shear waves can be tracked and their speed measured, with increasing tissue stiffness associated with increas ing tissue shear wave speed. 
Shear wave speed can be mathematically converted to both shear and Young’s moduli (in kPa), mechanical properties related to tissue rigidity and elasticity. There are two major forms of 
ultrasound SWE – “point” and “2D”.  Point  ultrasound SWE provides a very focal estimate of 
liver stiffness using a small region -of-interest, while 2D ultrasound SWE provides a regional 
color parameteric map (elastogram) of image stiffness and allows measurement over a much 
larger area of the liver.  
We have demonstrated excellent inter - and intra -observer reproducibility of ultrasound SWE 
measurements in soft and hard tissue -mimicking elasticity phantoms using two different US 
systems (Supersonic Imagine and Siemens Medical Solutions [LOCATION_003]) and five  different US 
transducers.  Coefficients of variation between various combinations of US systems, transducers, phantoms, and phantom depths were low, ranging from 0.5- 6.8%, and inter -operator agreement 
(four operators) was near -perfect (ICCs ≥ 0.99)  (15). We also have explored the in vivo 
relationship between liver shear wave speed and histologic fibrosis and observed significant 
positive correlations between liver shear wave speed and histologic fibrosis using point and 2D 
ultrasound SWE (Siemens Acuson S3000) (r = 0.68 and r = 0.73; p- values <0.0001) ( Figure 2 ).

marked liver stiffening immediately after the TCPC. Five subjects returned at a mean of 185 ± 
28 days, and mean liver stiffness remained elevated above baseline but with a variable response 
between patients when comparing the change in stiffness from early (2.[ADDRESS_974705] -op) to 
late ([ADDRESS_974706] -op) time points, which may reflect individual differences in cardiovascular 
performan ce or functional reserve (Figure  3).

[IP_ADDRESS] The use of Magnetic Resonance Elastrography to evaluate liver fibrosis  
MR elastography  uses a vibrating passive driver or “paddle” placed on the abdominal wall over 
the liver in order to generate in vivo shear waves. These shear waves can be tracked using an MRI modified phase contrast pulse sequence. Shear wave data is then used to generat e color 
parameteric maps (elastograms) of liver stiffness that allow  quantitative assessment ( Figure  4). 
We have demonstrated excellent agreement when using intra- class correlation coefficients to 
assess reproducibility of MR elastography measurements acro ss MRI scanners (Philips and GE 
Healthcare), field strengths (1.5T and 3T), and pulse sequences in 24 adult healthy volunteers. Pairwise ICCs ranged from 0.67 -0.82 when agreement was assessed between individual 
sequences across manufacturers (GE vs. Philips); the greatest agreement while fixing the pulse 
sequence was at 1.5T using 2D GRE sequences (ICC=0.82, r=0.85) ( 16). 
A study by [CONTACT_715615] (11 ) showed that MRI -derived liver stiffness was universally elevated 
in a cohort of children and young adults that had undergone the Fontan procedure. They also found a statistically significant inverse correlation between liver stiffness and cardiac index 
(p=0.02) and ejection fraction (p=0.002). Patients with long Fontan duration (>[ADDRESS_974711] -op) 
had greater liver stiffness compared with those having a shorter duration (p=0.02). The study provided evidence that elevated liver stiffness in Fontan patients is likely due to both fibrosis and 
congestion.

Color parametric map (elastogram) shows the distribution of stiffness within the  upper abdomen,

[IP_ADDRESS] Biomarkers and liver stiffness  
As noted previously, increased liver stiffness can be secondary to hepatic congestion and/or 
hepatic fibrosis. Circulating biomarkers pre viously demonstrated to be associated with 
congestive heart failure or tissue fibrosis may help to determine the primary driver of liver stiffness in a particular patient and help to monitor the response to targeted therapy. For instance, 
we would anticipa te that patients with increased liver stiffness due to hepatic congestion would 
have increased biomarkers of heart failure (e.g., BNP, NT -proBNP). Similarly, patients in whom 
fibrosis significantly contributes to increased liver stiffness may have elevatio n in biomarkers 
associated with liver fibrosis (e.g., ELF panel, miR -138, miR -143, or galectin- 3). The relative 
contribution of congestion or fibrosis (as determined by [CONTACT_715616]) to the observed level 
of liver stiffness may correlate with which therapeutic strategies are likely to be successful in a particular patient. Therefore, in this aim, we will determine which circulating biomarkers correlate with measures of liver stiffness and which correlate with a change in liver stiffness with udenafil treatment. We will use both a directed approach, with an analysis of candidate 
biomarkers validated for other disease processes, and a non- directed approach, which will 
identify novel biomarkers potentially associated with FALD.

7.4 Sample Management  
Sample collection and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) testing will be performed during the 
collection of samples for the FUEL -OLE study. A plasma sample for BNP level will be obtained 
at the time of entry into the study and at the end of the 1- year open la bel extension trial. The 
samples will be collected and processed on -site and the plasma will be shipped on dry ice to the 
FUEL -OLE Central Laboratory located at the University of Michigan. The Central Laboratory 
will aliquot a portion of the sample for BNP  testing in the University of Michigan Pathology 
Laboratory (UMPL) which performs this test for all patients seen in the University of Michigan 
Health System. In addition to this sample, FALD specific labs will be obtained at the same 
venipuncture.  The samples that will be collected for those patients enrolled in the FUEL -OLE 
and the ancillary study are as follows:  
Blood Samples  
• 3 mL in a purple top (K2EDTA) PPT tube for BNP measurement (FUEL -OLE sample)  
o Invert the tube gently five times. Further inversion  may cause alterations in 
sample integrity.  
o Centrifuge 10 minutes at 1600 x g using a refrigerated centrifuge (4° C)

approximately - 70°C  within 2 hours of collection.  
Biomarker Testing  
• BNP testing will be performed by [CONTACT_715622]  
• NT-proBNP levels measurements will be performed on the residual plasma sample using 
a commercially available enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) that will be run 
in the FUEL -OLE Central Laboratory.  
• MicroRNA measures will be performed on the residual plasma sample in the FUEL -OLE 
Central Laboratory on total RNA isolated using miRNeasy total RNA preps (QIAGEN, 
Valencia, CA). miRNA qRT -PCR analysis will be perfor med using Taqman miRNA 
assays (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). 5 ng total RNA will be used as an input 
into each reverse transcription reaction (RT) for each miRNA. Four replicates will be 
done for each miRNA, consisting of two replicate PCR reactions from each of the two 
replicate RT reactions, and the results were averaged. PCR reactions will be run on a 
7500 Real Time PCR machine (Applied Biosystems) and analyzed using 7500 System SDS software (v1.4). For the candidate biomarkers, an equivalent num ber of anonymous, 
age-matched, healthy controls will be used for comparison. The control cohort will be 
derived from healthy individuals who present to the University of Michigan for elective surgical procedures.  
• Enhanced Liver Fibrosis (ELF) score which i s based on the serum levels of hyaluronic 
acid (HA), amino -terminal propeptide of type III collagen (PI[INVESTIGATOR_120861]), and tissue inhibitor 
of metalloproteinase -1 (TIMP -1). Testing will be performed by [CONTACT_715623] -OLE Central 
Laboratory using the serum sample. In accordance with prior studies, we will assign those patients with scores of <7.7 to the no or mild fibrosis group, 7 -7-9.8 to the 
moderate fibrosis group, and >9.[ADDRESS_974722], as described above. NT -proBNP levels 
measurements will be performed using a commercially available enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) that will be run in the Russell laboratory. MicroRNA measures will be performed

terminal BNP  (NT -BNP)  
• Evaluate biomarkers of liver fibrosis  
• Proteomic and transcriptomic analyses on subcohorts of patients with the following:  
o Low level s of liver stiffness  
o Very high levels of liver stiffness  
o Decrease in liver stiffness with udenafil treatment  
 
9.0 PLANNED STATI STICAL ANALYSES AND STATISTICAL 
CONSIDERATIONS  
 
9.1 Statistical Analysis Plan  
A Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be developed and finalized prior to database lock. The 
SAP will contain detailed descriptions of data conventions and statistical  procedures . Any 
deviation(s) from the SAP will be described and justified in the clinical study report.  
9.2 Sample Size Determination  
Given the primary outcome is descriptive, sample size estimate is provided for secondary 
outcome 1 – evaluating the change in liver stiffness before and after udenafil treatment compared 
to a patient receiving on -going udenafil treatment.  Elastography indices measured by [CONTACT_715627] 12 months will be examined in both udenafil treatment 
groups (U+ and U -), using paired t -test or Wilcoxon signed-  rank test, as appropriate. DiPaola et 
al. (17) demonstrated that liver stiffness measured by [INVESTIGATOR_28936] -SWE significantly increased from 
baseline to [ADDRESS_974723] -TCPC (mean 1.18 ± SD 0.29 m/s to 2.08 ± 0.24 m/ s, p<.0001). 
Assuming a mean liver sheer wave speed (SWS) of 2.08 with known SD 0.24 as our baseline liver stiffness, a total sample size of 2 4 subjects (1 2 per group) is required to achieve 85% power 
with alpha=0.[ADDRESS_974724] 10% reduction of liver stiffness (deemed clinically meaningful in an individual) at 12 months from baseline in the U - group. Assuming a maximal enrollment of 100 
subjects, (approximately 50% of whom will be from the FUEL U - cohort), we would be powered 
to detect a difference of 3.75% reduction in liver stiffness. 
9.3 Analysis Populations  
All individuals enrolling in FUEL -OLE will be recruited for enrollment in the FALD study.  At 
completion of FUEL -OLE, once FUEL assignmen ts are unbl inded (udenafil or placebo), the

done both on an intent -to-treat and a per -protocol basis. 
9.4 Statistical Analysis  
9.4.1 General Methods  
This is a prospective, observational, cohort study.  
9.4.2 Primary Outcome  
The absolute stiffness by [CONTACT_715628].  
9.4.3 Secondary Outcomes  
Secondary outcome 1 
Baseline liver stiff ness measured by [CONTACT_715629] (U+ vs. U -) using appropriate  statistics . Next we will assess  change in liver 
stiffness from pre - to post -1 year udenafil treatment in the U -group as well as from 6 to 18 
months of therapy in the U+ group.  
Secondary outcome 2  
Changes in liver stiffness, diastolic cardiac function (including E/E’ and MPI), PAT 
measurement, and exercise measurements (including peak VO2 and submaximal exercise 
measures) from baseline to 1 2 months will be quantified. Correlation  between change in liver 
stiffness and changes in diastolic cardiac function and exercise measurements in the entire cohort and in the U - group and U+ group separately.  
Secondary outcome 3  
Bivariate analyses will examine 1) the correlation between each biomarker and liver stiffness 
measured by [CONTACT_715630] 2) the correlation between change in each biomarker and change in liver stiffness from baseline to 12 months in both the U+ and U - 
cohorts . 
The proteomic and transcriptomic data will be presented primarily as a descriptive report.  
Pairwise differences between groups may be sought using appropriate 2- group statistics, but we 
expect the limited sample size in this exploratory outcome to limit analysis to descriptive 
statistics.

Final Date: December [ADDRESS_974725] of the Clinical Trial, Confidentiality, and Potential Risks  
The clinical studies in this proposal meet the criteria in the NIH Supplemental Instructions for 
Preparing the Human Subjects Section of the Research Plan for Scenario B: Non -exempt human 
subject research, non -clinical trial. Although this will be a study ancillary to a clinical trial, this 
study is not a clinical trial; it collects additional data and measurements on all patients regardless 
of their status within FUEL -OLE.  
10.[ADDRESS_974726] of care; laboratory, 
radiologic, and echocardiographic testing will be performed within the framework of  the FUEL -
OLE trial and at interim time points per the standard of care. The research team will not be 
involved in clinical decisions .  Patient demographics and available clinical and laboratory data 
will be recorded  for the purposes of research.  
Biospecimen Collection  
No additional venipuncture beyond that already being obtained in F UEL -OLE will occur. Minor 
temporary discomfort may be associated with the removal of blood by [CONTACT_48571].  There is a risk of bruising and a very small amount of bl eeding associated with the blood drawing.  There is 
also a very small risk of infection at the site. Whenever possible, blood samples will be gathered 
when the participant is scheduled for routine blood testing or procedures. Serum collection will 
occur via venipuncture simultaneously with FUEL -OLE collection.  The total amount of serum 
obtained for both studies will be 6mL (3mL for FUEL -OLE and 3mL for this  study), which is 
within safe range for adolescent patients within FUEL -OLE’s height and weight criteria.   No 
DNA samples specific to FALD beyond what is already collected in FUEL -OLE will be 
obtained. 
MRI 
Risks related to MRI include subject distress/claustrophobia, projectile injury, and scanning with 
ferromagnetic implanted material (e.g., pacemaker or aneurysm clip) in the subject. Subjects experiencing distress/claustrophobia during MRI will be allowed to opt out of the MRI portion of 
the study; their US results will still be included in our results. Additionally, individuals with any

10.[ADDRESS_974728] the confidentiality of subjects and their 
families, including the following: 
Reporting of Test Findings  
The results of future tests on biological specimens will not be released to the subject/family.  
There is a reasonable possibility that no findings will result from this research effort.   If findings are detected, it may be years before any utility of these findings is realized.  Further, if samples 
are “anonymized” prior to release to other investigators for research, it may not be possible to 
trace the results back to the subject.  
If an incidental finding is found on a study clinical test such, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_715604]/parents, communicating with their primary cardiologist with permission, or making appropriate 
cardiology referrals as indicated.   The subject may choose to seek a second opi[INVESTIGATOR_138515]/or appropriate clinical care.  This might change the subject's insurability and emplo yability as it 
relates to the clinical finding only.  The presumption is that detection of a potentially clinically significant finding will prove to be beneficial.  
10.5 Potential Benefits  
Study Findings  
At the end of the study  study  results will be provided to treating/referring p hysician s 
(cardiologist, etc).  If udenafil is shown to reduce liver stiffness, it is possible that this can 
modify progression of FALD  and could directly benefit the enrollee .  This may directly benefit 
an individual by [CONTACT_715631].   It is possible that the liver scans obtained for the study 
will demonstrate significant abno rmalities in liver stiffness, and they may also find areas of 
significant fibrosis or cirrhosis.  Although the clinical significance of such findings remains

Final Date: December 11 , 2017 Confidential  unclear to the field, appreciation of these individual findings is likely to be beneficial for an 
individual’s care.   
Biospecimens  
Identification of optimal serum biomarkers of liver stiffness may directly benefit the individual 
by [CONTACT_715632].  In addition, we hope that the proteomic and 
transciptomic portion will help investigators to learn more about the rela tionship between genetic 
factors and pathophysiology of FALD.  This information may help physicians provide better answers to families’ questions regarding causes and risk.  It may also provide clues to future 
interventions and/or treatments. 
Indirect Benefit  
There might be an indirect benefit from the awareness that study results may help to improve the 
care of children with similar problems in the future.  Families may derive a sense of altruism, accomplishment, and contribution to furthering understa nding of the problem through their 
participation.  
10.6 Risk/Benefit Ratio an d Importance of Information to b e Obtained  
The risk/benefit ratio is favorable for this study and adverse events are not anticipated. The baseline risk is minimal because there are no therapeutic interventions specifically for the FALD study. There are direct potential benefits as described above.  In addition, although an individual 
subject may not benefit from participation, the results of this study will make important 
contributi ons to the improvement of knowledge of the causes of  congenital heart disease ( CHD) , 
in the development of new diagnostic tests, and ultimately in the improvement of treatment and 
prognosis.

assessment of how udenafil affects liver stiffness in a naïve patient. Each center may have access 
to only US SWE, MR elastography, or both. We expect most, if not all, centers to have access to US SWE, as it is now widely available, commonly employed in practice, and straightforward to use.  Our (CCHMC) radiology core (including MRI physicist Suraj Serai, PhD, and imaging 
post-processing laboratory) will be able to facilitate MR elastography capabilities at participating 
centers, ensuring the use of a standardized protocol across scanners.  Experience in processing 
and analyzing/interpretation of this relatively n ew measurement technique should be mitigated 
by [CONTACT_2363] a radiology core. MR elastography is more difficult to add for currently non- capable 
centers, thus, MR elastography measurements will be limited to centers that have capabilities.

will be recorded from each site. MREL data will need to be sent anonymized to CCHMC for 
central processing/analysis.  
The biomarker core lab will generate results for each blood specimen and will transmit that data 
electronically into the EDC  system (eCOS). Subject identification will follow the same system as 
for the FUEL Extension trial.  Each imaging study will be asso ciated with the FUEL Extension 
identification number and each blood sample will be labeled with that same number.  
FUEL -OLE enrollment takes place over a 2 day period.  For clarity, often the initial FUEL -OLE 
day (called hereafter OLE -D1) and the final day of FUEL are the same visit.  This visit consists 
of informed consent and assent, blood sample collection, EndoPAT testing, an echocardiogram, and exercise testing.  Based on experience with the Udenafil study, this day takes 5 -6 hours in 
total.  Subjects w ill then return the next day (OLE -D2) for drug administration and 6- minute 
walk.  Subjects will return at [ADDRESS_974731] recruitment:  FALD will only be recruited by [CONTACT_715633] [INVESTIGATOR_1660] a stud y coordinator 
after a commitment is given to participate in FUEL -OLE.  Recruiting should be done at the same 
time point as OLE to prevent unnecessarily repetitive patient contact.  
Consent/Assent:   C onsent and assent for FALD will be obtained immediately f ollowing but only 
after consent/assent for FUEL -OLE has been obtained.    
Serum testing:  Serum for the ancillary study will be obtained during the same venipuncture as 
used in FUEL -OLE.  The serum sample will be processed, stored and shipped in parallel w ith the 
plasma sample that is being collected for the FUEL -OLE Trial. The processed serum (and the 
processed plasma for the FUEL -OLE protocol) will be shipped to the FALD core lab (University 
of Michigan) for testing.  The ancillary study will require an a dditional 3 ml sample of blood (for 
a total of 6 ml).

Final Date: December 11 , 2017 Confidential  The DCC has primary responsibility for QC/QA activities of the phenotypic data. The DCC also 
requires that the sites complete certain QC activities, most of which are monitored by [CONTACT_15791].   
The key QC/QA activities include the following:  
• Development of a Study Manual;  
• Clearly formatted and carefully constructed Data Forms with clear, up -to-date manuals of 
instruction;  
• Sign-Off Procedures for all CRFs;  
• Central protocol training and certification of all site data collection staff with the use of 
standardized  checklists; 
• Data management training and certification of site personnel completing data entry  
and/or data management;  
• Verification of patient eligibility;  
• On-going monitoring of all protocols/data collection activities; 
• Completion of reliability and/or pi[INVESTIGATOR_715605];  
• Inclusion of repeat measurements, as feasible, in the course of the study; and  
• Monitoring visits to sites as required with p re-specified goals and/or remote monitoring

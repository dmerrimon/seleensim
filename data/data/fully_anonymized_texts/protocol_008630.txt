.Jun 1  2020 9, 2019SECTION I:  RESEARCH PLAN
1.Statement of Purpose:  State the scientific aim(s) of the study, or the hypotheses to be tested.
To demonstrate  faster time to extubation after arrival in the cardiothoracic ICU in patients 
undergoing Aortic Valve Replacement (AVR), Coronary Artery By[CONTACT_15725] (CABG), or AVR/CABG 
combination surgery who receive study drug (Sugammadex 2mg/kg) as compared to placebo.
2.Probable  Duration of Project: State the expected duration of the project, including all follow-up and data 
analysis activities.
Approximately 36  months
It is  estimated that 3 subjects will be randomized per week allowing for data collection to be 
completed in 2 years for study start-up, with an additional 12 months for data analysis.
3.Background:  Describe the background information that led to the plan for this project. Provide references to 
support the expectation of obtaining useful scientific data.
Prolonged intubation after  cardiac surgery continues to be a common clinical challenge and is 
associated with significant risks and costs1-5. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] a Class I recommendation by [CONTACT_172013] (CABG) surgeries6. A sizable proportion of patients 
continue to have a prolonged course of cardiothoracic intensive care unit (CTICU) intubation1.
Sugammadex, a  gamma-cyclodextrin drug with a plasma elimination half-life of [ADDRESS_201780] undergone AVR, CABG, or a combination 
AVR/CABG procedure.  The FDA-approved package  insert is attached as an appendix  to this application.
4.Research Plan:  Summarize the study design and research procedures using non-technical language that can 
be readily understood by [CONTACT_20894]. Be sure to distinguish between standard of care vs. 
research procedures when applicable, and include any flowcharts of visits specifying their individual times and 
lengths. Describe the setting in which the research will take place.

.Jun 1  2020 9, [ZIP_CODE].For  enrolled patients, anesthetic management will be left to the discretion of the attending 
anesthesiology provider with the exception that Rocuronium or Vecuronium (both SOC) will be 
used as the non-depolarizing NMB and that where sedation is desired.
2.Patients  will be transferred to the CTICU intubated  and on a propofol  infusion  and/or 
dexmedetomidine (Precedex) from the operating room. Both meds are used SOC.
3.Upon  CTICU arrival, the patients  surgeon  and CTICU intensivist  will determine if patient is able to 
proceed with fast-track extubation. Determination of continued eligibility based on the post- 
recruitment pre-randomization exclusion criteria will be determined by a member of the study 
team. Eligible patients will be randomized, investigational pharmacy will be contact[CONTACT_172014] 30 minutes of the ICU admission, propofol will be discontinued. Precedex may 
be continued per clinical discretion.
4.The  participant  will be randomized to receive Sugammadex or placebo. The enrolled  patients will 
be assigned to the study and control arms in a 1:1 ratio.
5.IDS  will provide the Sugammadex (2mg/kg) vs. Placebo in a syringe. A qualitative train-of-four 
measurement will be obtained. The administration of the study drug and placebo compounds 
will be performed by [CONTACT_172015] a blinded fashion from the 
departmental research pharmacy. The study drug will be supplied by [CONTACT_44873].
6.The  clinical care provider has the discretion to determine the appropriate ventilation settings on a 
case-by-case basis, in accordance with the suggestion that patients will be initiated on SIMV rate of 
14 with 60% FiO 2, tidal volumes 8-10 ml/kg and PEEP of7.
7.Ten  minutes after the drug administration, if the patient can lift their head and remains 
hemodynamically stable, the patient will be switched to CPAP mode of ventilation for 30 
minutes. At the end of the CPAP trial tidal volumes, Rapid Shallow Breathing Index (RSBI) and 
ABG will be assessed. The patient will be extubated if he/she is not hypoxic/ hypercarbic, has 
RSBI<100 and has TV >[ADDRESS_201781]  to reattempt CPAP versus 
continuing controlled mechanical ventilation.
Study participation  will end when the patient is successfully extubated. AE assessment will be 
performed in the period immediately following extubation.

9.How  will eligibility be determined, and by [CONTACT_20898]?
Eligibility at  pre-op and post-op will be based on protocol specific inclusion and exclusion criteria 
and will be determined by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_54720]-I’s in collaboration with the ICU attending physician
10.Risks:  Describe the reasonably foreseeable risks, including risks to subject privacy, discomforts, or 
inconveniences associated with subjects participating in the  research.
Sugammadex is  generally safe and well tolerated. Potential risks associated with sugammadex are: 
hypersensitivity, including anaphylaxis/anaphylactic shock – previous trials suggest this risk is small. 
Cardiac arrhythmias including bradycardia & tachycardia where intervention is rare and responsive 
to usual treatment. Other reported risks include nausea, vomiting, constipation.
Bleeding was  originally thought to be a side effect, but studies have since showed that Sugammadex 
falsely elevates the PTT without increasing bleeding risk. (see reference on last page.)
11.Minimizing  Risks: Describe the way the above-mentioned risks will be minimized.
Patients will  all be in a critical care  environment  and monitored very closely including: blood pressure, 
heart rate, and chest tube output will be tracked from arrival to the CTICU until extubation per ICU 
protocol. Subtle changes in the patient’s hemodynamic status are easily seen and treated if necessary.
12.Data  and Safety Monitoring Plan: Include an appropriate Data and Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP) based on 
the investigator’s risk assessment stated below. (Note: the HIC will make the final determination of the risk to 
subjects.)
a. What  is the investigator’s  assessment of the overall risk level for subjects  participating in this 
study? Greater than minimal risk
b. If  children are involved, what is the investigator’s assessment of the overall risk level for the 
children participating in this study? N/A
c. Include  an appropriate Data and Safety Monitoring Plan
1.Personnel responsible for the safety review and its frequency:
The principal investigator, with  the DSMB will be responsible for monitoring the data, assuring protocol 
compliance, and conducting the safety reviews, which must be conducted at a minimum of every 3 
months (including when reapproval of the protocol is sought). During the review process, the principal 
investigator (monitor) and the DSMB will evaluate whether the study should continue unchanged, 
require modification/amendment, or close to enrollment. Either the principal investigator, the IRB or 
DSMB have the authority to stop or suspend the study or require modifications.
2.The risks associated with the current study are deemed greater than minimal for the following 
reasons: (choose those that apply)

.Jun [ADDRESS_201783] assessed the proposed study as one of greater than minimal risk, the potential exists 
for anticipated and/or unanticipated adverse events, serious or otherwise, to occur since it is not 
possible to predict with certainty the absolute risk in any given individual or in advance of first-hand 
experience with the proposed study methods. Therefore, we provide a plan for monitoring the data and 
safety of the proposed study as follows:
3.Attribution  of Adverse Events:
Adverse events  will be monitored for each subject participating in the study and attributed to the study 
procedures / design by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Amit Bardia according to the following categories:
a.) Definite:  Adverse event is clearly  related to investigational procedures(s)/agent(s). 
b.) Probable: Adverse event is likely related to investigational procedures(s)/agent(s). 
c.) Possible: Adverse event may be related to investigational procedures(s)/agent(s).
d.) Unlikely:  Adverse event is likely not to be related to the investigational procedures(s)/agent(s). 
e.) Unrelated: Adverse event is clearly not related to investigational procedures(s)/agent(s).
4.Plan  for Grading Adverse Events:
The following  scale will be used in grading the severity of adverse events noted during the study:
1.Mild  adverse event
2.Moderate adverse  event
3.Severe
5.Plan  for Determining Seriousness of Adverse Events:
Serious Adverse  Events:
In addition  to grading the adverse event, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_22414] a Serious Adverse Event (SAE). An adverse event is considered serious if it results in any of 
the following outcomes:
1.Death;
2.A life-threatening  experience in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_172006];
3.A persistent  or significant disability or incapacity;
4.A congenital  anomaly or birth defect;  OR

.Jun [ADDRESS_201784]’s health and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other 
outcomes listed in this  definition.
An adverse  event may be graded as severe but still not meet the criteria for a Serious Adverse Event. 
Similarly, an adverse event may be graded as moderate but still meet the criteria for an SAE. It is 
important for the PI [INVESTIGATOR_22415] “seriousness” when determining 
whether reporting to the IRB is necessary.
Only the following  adverse events will be tracked.  These AE’s will trigger an immediate  DSMB review; any 
incidence of anaphylaxis; unexplained hypotension requiring initiation of pressors; cardiac pacing within 
5 minutes of drug administration; tachycardia, bradycardia or onset of atrial fibrillation; or increases in 
chest tube output considered clinically significant by [CONTACT_172017]. The DSMB will be notified 
within 2 business days  of determination by [CONTACT_19381]. A written report  will be provided within 7 
days of the determination.  Any incidents meeting SAE criteria will be reported  per the IRB reporting policy.
If the  DSMB determines that study drug may be causing an increase in adverse events, the study will be 
suspended until the DSMB can fully review the events and make a recommendation in consultation with 
the Yale Human Investigations Committee. The local [COMPANY_006] research representative will also be notified 
about the events (within 2 business days in case of any serious adverse events). If the data monitoring 
board and/or IRB view that the study is unsafe, the study will be discontinued.
6.Plan  for reporting UPI[INVESTIGATOR_20865] (including Adverse Events) to the IRB
The principal investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_22416]:
Any incident,  experience or outcome that meets ALL 3 of the following criteria:
1.Is  unexpected (in terms of nature, specificity, severity, or frequency) given (a) the research 
procedures described in the protocol-related documents, such  as the IRB-approved protocol 
and informed consent document and (b) the characteristics of the subject population being 
studied; AND
2.Is  related or possibly related to participation in the research (possibly related means there is 
a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused by 
[CONTACT_3459]); AND
3.Suggests  that the research places subjects or others at greater risk of harm (including 
physical, psychological, economic, legal, or social harm) than was previously known or 
recognized.

13.Statistical  Considerations: Describe the statistical analyses that support the study design.
Variables/Time Points  of Interest
The primary  outcome is the time to extubation, which will be the duration from arrival to the ICU to 
the extubation time.
Proposed statistical  test/analysis: Positively skewed variables will be log-transformed prior to 
hypothesis testing. For the primary outcome, a two-sided Student’s t-test will be used to compare

.Jun 1  2020 9, 2019the time  to extubation between the two groups. If necessary, covariate adjustment will be made 
using the multiple linear regression analysis method. Differences between means and 95% 
confidence intervals will be estimated to describe the magnitude of intervention difference between 
the two groups. As part of sensitivity analyses, the time-to-extubation outcome will be also analyzed 
by [CONTACT_172018]. To compare the categorical adverse events between two groups, chi- 
square test or Fisher’s exact test will be used.
Missing Data:  Prevention is the most obvious and effective manner to control bias and loss of power 
from missing data. Therefore, several strategies (e.g., timely data entry and daily missing data 
report) will be imposed to limit the likelihood that missing data will occur during this study. This 
protocol will follow the intention to treat principle, requiring follow-up of all subjects randomized 
regardless of the actual treatment received.
Power analysis:  Our ‘in-house’ historical data (n = 73) showed that after excluding outliers greater 
than the 80th percentile, patients undergoing isolated CABG demonstrated a mean of 8.39 hours to 
extubation (SD 2.89). Although we anticipate a Hawthorne effect demonstrating reduced time to 
extubation in both the active and placebo arms of the present study, we have conservatively chosen 
to maintain power based on historical data. We therefore estimate that 45 subjects per group will 
give us 90% power to detect a clinically relevant effect size of 2-hours difference between active and 
placebo groups at an alpha value of 0.[ADDRESS_201786]

6.Process of Consent/Assent: Describe the setting and conditions under which consent/assent will be obtained, 
including parental permission or surrogate permission and the steps taken to ensure subjects’ independent 
decision-making.
When the  study team identifies, or is referred a patient who may be study eligible, the patient will be 
informed about the study. If the patient is interested they will have the opportunity to read the consent 
form and ask questions. The investigator or research staff will review the full Compound Authorization 
and Consent document with the subject discussing the purpose and scope of the study, explaining any 
risks and/or potential benefits, procedures associated with participation, economic considerations, 
confidentiality of the subject’s information, and their ability to voluntarily participate and withdraw at 
any time during the study. will be explained in person. It will be explained to the subject that 
participation is completely voluntary and that they may withdraw at any time without penalty. Only 
after the patient has a thorough understanding of the study and what is being asked of them and after 
all their questions have been answered by a coordinator and an investigator, will they be asked to 
indicate a decision to participate by [CONTACT_172024]. Consent will be obtained at least [ADDRESS_201788]’s preference. Once the subject has received and 
reviewed the consent, the clinical research nurse will answer any questions about participation by 
[CONTACT_648]. Once the research nurse is satisfied  that  the potential subject understands the study and wishes 
to participate, the clinical research nurse will obtain a written consent via email, mail, fax or photograph 
of the entire document including the subject’s signature [CONTACT_172029]. A copy of the signed form will be provided to the subject.
7.Evaluation of Subject(s) Capacity to Provide Informed Consent/Assent: Indicate how the personnel obtaining 
consent will assess the potential subject’s ability and capacity to consent to the research being proposed. 
Once the explanation of the study is complete and the subject and/or surrogate verifies 
understanding, the study staff and/or investigators will ask questions of the participant and/or 
surrogate to elicit as to whether the participant understands the study and that participation is 
voluntary. Patients ability to sign consent on their own behalf may also be assessed by [CONTACT_172025]/or PAT staff if possible. If there are any doubts about the patient’s cognition and surrogate will 
be approached to sign on the patient’s behalf.

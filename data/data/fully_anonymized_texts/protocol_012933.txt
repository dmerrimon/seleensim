1.0 INTRODUCTION 
This protocol proposes to examine the anti -tumor efficacy of IPI -549 in patients with  
locally  advanced  HPV+ or  HPV- HNSCC.  Subjects  who are candidates  for surgical  resection  will 
be enrolled and treated with IPI -549 for 2 weeks prior to surgery. Tumor tissue for research  
purposes will be obtained by [CONTACT_862421] 2 weeks of  
treatment.  Tissue  will be evaluated  by [CONTACT_862422]3Kγ -regulated  immune  
suppression signatures  that we previously identified;  changes  in immune  responses will be 
validat ed by [CONTACT_862423] T cell composition and 
activation  status  and by [CONTACT_862424]-tumor T cell receptor  (TCR)  
clonality.  
 
 
2.0 BACKGROUND AND  RATIONALE  
 
2.1 Immunotherapy  in HNSCC 
Immune therapy  holds great  promise  for the treatment  of cancer  patients,  as novel 
immunotherapeutic agents  such as the checkpoint inhibitors pembrolizumab and nivolumab (anti- 
PD-1) have recently demonstrated potent  anti-tumor activity in  a subset of cancer patients.  
Disappointingly, clinical  responses to these  checkpoint inhibitors occurred  in only 20% of patients  
with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), a devastating disease that is associated  
with considerable morbidity and  mortality.  Improved t herapeutic  approaches  that target  the 
mechanisms of immune escape from checkpoint inhibitors could hold great promise for patients  
with HNSCC and other cancers. Recent studies from our lab and others show that immune  
suppressive Tumor Associated Macrophages (TAMs) and Myeloid Derived Suppressor Cells  
(MDSCs) promote escape from checkpoint inhibitors. Signals from the tumor microenvironment  
polarize these myeloid cells towards an immunosuppressive phenotype that is characterized by  
[CONTACT_862425] A rginase,  TGFß,  IL10  and low levels  of MHCII,  IL12,  iNOS  and T cell 
chemoattractants such as CXCL9 and CXCL10. TAMs and MDSCs then suppress CD8+ T -cell 
recruitment, survival, and cytotoxic function, thereby [CONTACT_862426] -tumor immune  
responses. Novel immune therapeutics that circumvent resistance to checkpoint inhibitors could  
provide benefit to numerous cancer  patients, including patients with HNSCC.  
We recently  identified  a novel pathway by [CONTACT_862427] [1, 2]. We found that phosphatidylinositol-4,5- 
bisphosphate 3- kinase gamma (PI3Kγ), a myeloid cell selective isoform of PI3 -Kinase, mediates  
immune suppression in TAMs and MDSCs by [CONTACT_862428],  
S6K and c/EBPß activation, thereby [CONTACT_862429] T cell responses to tumors. Our results demonstrated that PI3Kγ, the major PI3K isoform  
in myeloid  cells,  promotes resistance to checkpoint inhibitors and stimulates  tumor progression as 
selective inactivation  of PI3Kγ  suppressed myeloid  cell expression  of immune  suppressive factors  
and inhibited  tumor progression in mouse models of HNSCC,  lung, breast,  and pancreatic 
carcinoma, as well as melanoma and glioblastoma. Importantly, PI3Kγ inhibition stimulated  
responses to checkpoint inhibitors, leading to eradication of tumors and long -term anti-tumor 
immunological memory  in mouse models of HNSCC.

 Importantly, we also identified  a PI3Kγ -regulated  gene expression  signature [CONTACT_862448].  Notably, high expression of a PI3Kγ - 
regulated immune suppression signature [CONTACT_862449]. Conversely, low expression of this signature [CONTACT_862450].  These results  suggested  that a PI3Kγ -regulated  immune  suppression signature [CONTACT_862451]3Kγ inhibitor therapy and to monitor  
clinical  responses to P I3Kγ -inhibitors. 
 
2.2 Study  Agent  
2.2.1  IPI-549 
The PI3K -γ isoform plays important roles in immune cell function and migration, including the  
immune suppressive tumor microenvironment. IPI -549 is a potent and selective PI3K - γ inhibitor  
that is being developed  by [CONTACT_206841], Inc. (Infinity) as an orally administered  
potential therapeutic in  multiple  cancer  indications. 
2.2.[ADDRESS_1202301] of IPI -549 on tumor growth was evaluated in vivo using immune competent,  
murine syngeneic solid tumor models. Mice treated with IPI -549 demonstrated significant tumor  
growth inhibition in multiple syngeneic models.  Tumor growth inhibition was dose -dependent 
with dose-proportional plasma  and tumor exposure for IPI-549. Studies to elucidate the mechanism  
of tumor growth  inhibition  indicated  that IPI-549 affects  immune -suppressive myeloid  cell 
numbers and/or function, leading to an increase in cytotoxic T cell activity. Studies in both nude  
and CD8 T cell -depleted mice demonstrated the T -cell-dependence of IPI -549 mediated tumor  
growth  inhibition. 
2.2.3 Rationale  for IPI-549 as a Potential Therapy  for Patients with Cancer  
PI3K -γ is expressed  in immune  cells and has limited,  if any, expression  in epi[INVESTIGATOR_862407]. Furthermore, PI3K -γ is the predominant catalytic isoform found in myeloid cells [2]. In 
myeloid  cells PI3K -γ is activated  by [CONTACT_862430],  the Toll Like Receptors/Interleukin 1 Receptors  and 
RTKs  [2]. The role of myeloid  cells in promoting tumor growth  has been  demonstrated in multiple  
preclinical mouse models [3]. Tumors and their associated stroma secrete chemokines that attract  
precursor monocytes that differentiate into macrophages. The tumor associated macrophages as  
well as dendritic cells and granulocytes (collectively known as myeloid derived suppressor cells  
[MDSC]), actively support the proliferation of the tumor cells while at the same time actin g to 
suppress host antitumor activity  [4].

Protocol Version: 5.0 
Protocol  Date: January  15, 2021  Page  14 of 45  
 Pre-clinical data from a tumor bearing mouse knockout model of PI3K -γ results in a  
reduced influx of myeloid cells, and reduced vascularization of the tumor, resulting in reduced  
tumor growth, suggesting that PI3K -γ inhibition can play a critical role in disrupting the MDSCs  
[2]. 
The established role of PI3K -γ in the biology of the tumor microenvironment supports  
testing  IPI-549 in patients  with cancer,  both as a single  agent, and in combination  with other drugs.  
The PI3K -γ isoform plays important roles in immune cell function and migration, including the  
immune suppressive tumor microenvironment. IPI -549 is a potent and selective PI3K - γ inhibitor  
that is being developed by [CONTACT_862431], Inc. (Infinity) as an orally administered  
potential therapeutic in  multiple  cancer  indications. 
 
2.3 Rationale  
HPV+ and HPV- head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) are deadly and  
disfiguring cancers with limited therapeutic options; while checkpoint inhibitors have promise as  
new cancer therapeutics, they have demonstrated limited activity in HNSCC. However, we found  
that inhibitors of PI3Kγ, such as Infinity Pharmaceutical’s highly selective inhibitor, IPI -549, 
repolarized tumor associated  macrophages to reverse immune suppression and stimulate anti - 
tumor immunity in animal models of HNSCC. We identified a signature [CONTACT_862452]+ and HPV - HNSCC that was reversed by [CONTACT_976]3Kγ inhibition [5]. Using  
TCGA data, we found that this same signature [CONTACT_862453]+ and  
HPV- HNSCC  patients  [5]. Our results  suggest  that selective  PI3Kγ  inhibitors might  promote anti- 
tumor immune  responses in HNSCC  patients.  We hypothesize  that treatment  with  the selective  
PI3Kγ inhibitor IPI -[ADDRESS_1202302]  of IPI-549 on biomarkers of immune  suppression. 
Patients with resectable HNSCC will be treated with the investigational, highly selective PI3Kγ  
inhibitor IPI -549 for two weeks  prior to surgical resection; pre - and post -treatment biopsies will  
be evaluated  for changes  in the PI3Kγ -responsive gene  expression  signature [CONTACT_862454]. Additionally, we will monitor for changes intratumoral and  
circul ating immune cell populations in collaboration with [CONTACT_862462], OHSU, using  
multiplex  immunohistochemistry.  These studies will be useful in identifying  biomarkers of 
response that will allow  optimization  of future  therapeutic strategies  for HNSCC.

 3.2 Secondary  Objectives  
1. To measure changes in myeloid and T cell composition and activation status by  
[CONTACT_862432].  
2. To determine  safety  and tolerability  of IPI-549 and change in tumor size in patients  
with locally  advanced  HNSCC.  
3. To measure changes  in peripheral  cytokines and  immune  cells 
 
3.3 Endpoints  
 
We hypothesize that mRNA signatures of immune response will be increased in IPI -549- treated  
HNSCC  patients.  For the efficacy  endpoints, RECISTv1.1 will be used. 
 
Primary  Endpoints  
 
We hypothesize that the 5 -gene mRNA immune response signature [CONTACT_862455]. [2] will 
increase with treatment.  
 
Specifically,  the signature  [CONTACT_832]: s= IL12A + IL12B + IFNG  + CD8A  – IL6, measured  by [CONTACT_862433] a custom Nanostring Immune  Profiling  panel.  
 
Secondary  Endpoints  
 
1. Adverse events  related  to IPI-549 (description, grade  [CTCAE  v5.0], and seriousness).  
2. T cell receptor  (TCR)  sequencing from  blood obtained at  baseline,  surgery,  end of treatment  
or at time  of disease progression. 
3. Comparison of pre- vs. post-treatment tumor tissue for CD8 expression by 
[CONTACT_9064]  
4. Comparison of pre- vs. post- treatment  peripheral cytokines  and immune  cells.  
 
We hypothesize that the 42- mRNA signature [CONTACT_39299]3Kγ [2] will increase with treatment. Gene  
expression  will be  assessed by  [CONTACT_862434].  
Specifically, the signature [CONTACT_862456] 21 immune response and T -cell 
activation genes, plus the sum of 10 antigen presentation genes, minus the sum of 11 immune  
suppression genes [2]  listed below.

5.0 TREATMENT PLAN  
 
5.1 Study  Design 
This is a phase 2 window of opportunity trial in  patients  with locally  advanced  HNSCC.  Subjects  
who are candidates for surgical resection will be enrolled and treated with 2 weeks of IPI-549, a 
specific PI3Kγ inhibitor. Tumor tissue for research purposes through core biopsies will be  
obtained prior to initiation of IPI -549 and at surgery. 
 
5.2 T reatment  Dosage  and Administration  
 
IPI-549 will be administered 40 mg orally over a 14 day cycle. Dose of IPI -549 will be determined  
based on observed toxicity in ongoing Infinity clinical trial ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). IPI -549 should be self - 
administered orally (approximately every 24 hours). IPI -549 should be swallowed whole with a glass  
of water  (approximately  8 ounces or 240 mL).  Subjects must  avoid  grapefruit and grapefruit juice  while 
on study drug. Subjects should be advised  to avoid  food and liquids  other than water  from [ADDRESS_1202310] a Safety Follow -up visit approximately 30 (+ 7) days after the last dose of  
study drug. At minimum this visit should include collection of AEs/SAEs and concomitant  
medications/procedures. This will be a clinic visit. The following activities will be performed  
during the visit,  assessment  of concomitant medications,  adverse events,  physical  exam,  vital signs  
and height, ECOG PS, CBC with differential, CMP . MRI or CT scan will be performed if  
clinically  indicated.  
 
 
5.5 Discontinuation  from  Study  Participation  
Patients may be removed from study participation for the following reasons (in  addition to those 
listed  for discontinuation of study treatment):  
• The patient  or legal  representative withdraws  consent for follow-up; 
• The patient  is lost to follow-up; 
• The patient  dies;  
• It is the decision of the investigator.

6.2 Screening/Baseline  Procedures 
Assessments performed exclusively to determine eligibility for this study will be done only after  
obtaining informed consent. Assessments performed for clinical indications (not exclusively to  
determine study eligibility) may be used for baseline values even if the studies were done before 
informed  consent was obtained. 
 
All screening procedures must be performed within 7 days prior to registration unless otherwise stated.  The screening  procedures include:  
• Written  informed  consent  (within  28 days) . 
• Review  of inclusion and exclusion criteria.  
• Complete  medical/oncology history. 
• Demographics. 
• Documentation of concomitant  medications.  
• Complete  physical examination,  including vital signs and height. 
• Performance  status  assessment.  
• Laboratory  tests (within  7 days; pregnancy test within  72 hours) . 
• Blood collection  for correlative studies. 
• Documentation of tumor staging.  
• Tumor biopsy tissue  collection  for correlative studies  (within  28 days) . 
 
7.0 ADVERSE EVENTS  
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient receiving study treatment 
and which  does not necessarily  have a causal  relationship  with this treatment.  An AE can therefore  
be any unfavorable  and unintended sign (including a clinically significant abnormal laboratory  
finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an experimental intervention, 
whether  or not related to  the intervention. 
 
Progression  of the cancer  under study or events  which  are unequivocally due to disease progression 
should not be reported as an AE during the study (unless it is considered to be drug related by [CONTACT_1275]).

Protocol Version: 5.0 
Protocol  Date: January  15, [ADDRESS_1202320] be reported  in an expedited  manner  
to allow  for optimal monitoring  of patient safety  and care.  
 
As far as  possible, each adverse event  should be evaluated  to determine:  
• duration (start  and end dates)  
• severity  (grade) 
• seriousness 
• relationship  to study agent 
• action  taken  (i.e., none, study agent  modification,  medical  intervention) 
• outcome (i.e., resolved  without sequelae,  resolved with sequelae,  ongoing)  
 
Adverse events monitoring begins a t the time of initiating study treatment through [ADDRESS_1202321] administration of study treatment or study discontinuation/termination, or the  
initiation  of new anti-cancer  therapy,  whichever is earlier,  whether  or not related  to IPI -549. 
 
Note:  Serious adverse events must be recorded in the case report forms for this 90 day-period; 
however, non-serious adverse events need only be recorded through [ADDRESS_1202322] possibly  related to study treatment will be  
monitored until:  
 the adverse event  resolves or the symptoms or signs that constitute  the adverse 
event  return to baseline; 
 any clinically  significant abnormal laboratory values  have returned  to baseline;  
 there is a satisfactory  explanation other than the study drug for the changes  
observed; or 
 death.  
 
7.2 Severity  
All non-hematologic adverse events will be graded according to the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0. The CTCAE v5.0 is available at  
http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html
 
 
If no  CTCAE  grading is available,  the severity  of an AE  is graded as  follows: 
Mild (grade 1):  Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic  
observations only; intervention not indicated.  
Moderate (grade 2):  Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; 
limiting  age- appropriate instrumental activities  of daily  living (ADL).  Instrumental ADL

 refer to preparing meals, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3112], using the telephone, managing 
money, etc.  
Severe (grade 3):  Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening;  
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_349936]; disabling; limiting self -care 
ADL. Self -care ADL refer to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the 
toilet,  taking medications, and not bedridden 
Life-threatening  (grade  4): Life -threatening  consequences; urgent intervention indicated.  
Fatal  (grade  5): Death  related to  AE. 
 
7.3 Seriousness  
A “serious” adverse event  is defined  in regulatory  terminology  as any untoward medical  
occurrence that: 
1. Results  in death.  
 
2. Is life-threatening.  
The patient  was at risk of death  at the time of the event;  it does not refer  to an event  that 
hypothetically  might have caused death if  it were  more  severe.  
3. Requires  in-patient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10909]. 
Note:  The following  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_592313]:  
• A visit to the emergency room or other hospi[INVESTIGATOR_20347] < 24 hours 
that does not result  in admission  (unless considered  an important medical  
or life-threatening  event)  
• Elective  surgery,  planned prior to signing consent 
• Admissions as per protocol for a planned medical/surgical  procedure 
• Routine health  assessment  requiring admission  for baseline/trending  of 
health  status (e.g., routine colonoscopy) 
• Medical/surgical  admission  other than to remedy  ill health  and planned 
prior to entry into the study. Appropriate documentation is required in 
these cases.  
• Admission  encountered  for another life circumstance that carries  no 
bearing  on health  status  and requires  no medical/surgical  intervention  (eg, 
lack of housing, economic inadequacy, caregiver  respi[INVESTIGATOR_040],  family  
circumstances,  administrative  reason).  
• Admission  for administration  of anticancer  therapy  in the absence of  any other SAEs.  
 
4. Results  in persistent  or significant disability  or incapacity. 
5. Is  a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
6. Is an important medical  event  
Any event  that does not meet  the above criteria,  but that in the judgment of the investigator  
jeopardizes the patient, may be considered for reporting as a serious adverse event. The  
event  may require medical  or surgical  intervention to prevent one of the outcomes  listed  in 
the definition of “Serious  Adverse Event“.  
For example: allergic  bronchospasm requiring  intensive treatment  in an emergency  room

 or at home; convulsions that may  not result  in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059];  development of drug abuse 
or drug dependency. 
 
7.4 Relationship  
Attribution categories for adverse events in relationship to protocol therapy are as follows:  
Definite  – The AE is clearly  related to the study  treatment.  
Probable – The AE is likely related to the study treatment.  
Possible – The AE may be related to the study treatment.  
Unlikely – The AE is doubtfully related to the study treatment.  
Unrelated  – The  AE is clearly NOT  related to  the study treatment.

9.2 Study  Design/Study  Endpoints  
We anticipate  enrolling [ADDRESS_1202331] at 5% significance level.  With [ADDRESS_1202332] 80% power to  
detect  a difference  in the mean  signature  [CONTACT_862447] 0.[ADDRESS_1202333] sizes less than this would be unlikely to be clinically interesting. Also, the  
differences seen between the poor prognosis and good prognosis groups in Kaneda et al. [2] were  
greater than this minimal effect  size. Thus the study appears to be well -powered to detect  
meaningful differences.

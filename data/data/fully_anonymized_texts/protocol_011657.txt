AMENDMENT 3: RATIONALE FOR CHANGES  
 
This amendment updates and supersedes  Amendment 2 dated 14 -June-2021.  
 
Modifications made to the protocol as a part of Amendment 3 and a brief rationale for the 
changes are summarized below.   
 
Major Revisions include:   
• Eliminat ed C ohorts A and B  
• Study now consists of a single cohort with 60 patients with screening  (central 
laboratory)  BK viral load between 350 and 10,000,000 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL . Increasing from the 
previous maximum of 50,000 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL to a maximum of 10,000,000 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL allows 
for inclusion of a greater number of patients, including t hose with higher viral loads, in 
order to include patients with an even greater unmet medical need.  
• Added stratification based on screening BK viral load  
• Stratum [ADDRESS_784757] of patients with a BK viral load  at 
screening  
• Stratum [ADDRESS_784758] of patients with a BK viral load  
at screening  
• Stratification will allow for equal randomization among  active and placebo  arms  for 
patient populations . 
• Changed local BK viral l oad (ie, pre -screening values) requirement from 1,000  to 
<10,000 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/ mL for Cohort A and 10,000  to 50,000 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL for Cohort B to any 
positive local BK viral load, and c larifi ed that whole blood or plasma results may be 
used for local BK viral load  
• Allowing results from local laboratories s implifies screening for sites, while making the 
final determination of eligibility reliant on the standardized VL testing at the central 
laboratory to ensure consistent screening data.   
• Allow ed local BK viral load (ie, pre -screening values) to be within 90 days prior to 
screening (instead of 21 days)  
• Increasing the window for pre -screening simplifies screening for sites, while retaining the 
rigor and consistency of central laboratory testing for final determination of eligibility.

Confidential & Proprietary   
Version 4.0, 30 Sep 2021 3 • For patients in Period [ADDRESS_784759] 2 weeks apart  and who no longer require dosing visits , 
allowed subsequent study visits  (excluding Weeks 8 and 12)  to be conducted by a 
Sponsor -approved home health vendor in conjunction with a Sponsor -approved 
telehealth  provider  
• Allowing more home -health visits reduces patient burden.  
• For all patients, a llowed study visits after Week 12 to be conducted by a Sponsor -
approved home health vendor in conjunction with a Sponsor -approved telehealth 
provider  
• Allowing more home -health visits reduces patient burden.  
• Eliminated long -term follow -up period (ie, Weeks 48 to 96)  
• Study duration is now 26 weeks (2 -week screen ing period, 12 -week treatment period, 
12-week follow -up period) . 
• Patients will be eligible for enrollment in a long -term observation al study (ALVR105 -
401) and  will be encouraged to enroll in this study.  
• Eliminating the long -term follow -up reduces patient b urden in this study, while allowing 
more flexible visit timing in the observational study.  Also allows  twice as much  long-
term- follow up  in the observational study ( — up to 4 years — compared  to the original 
protocol) . 
• Eliminated  sirolimus and everolimus as prohibited medications  
• Removed from prior /concomitant therapy in exclusion criterion #10 ( Section 5.2). 
• Added  as medications  that cannot be started during  the first 12 weeks  of the study  to 
Excluded Medications and/or Procedures ( Section 6.8.1 ). 
• Allowing patients with persistent BK viremia whose immunosuppression thera py prior to 
enrollment included these medication s,  to allow them to participate in the study , while 
avoiding the confounding factor of initiating these medications during the treatment 
period.  
• Added interim administrative analyses  and removed interim ana lyses 1 to 3 from the 
original protocol  
• The first  administrative  interim analysis will be performed by [CONTACT_594890] [ADDRESS_784760] 
completed 8 weeks in the study  
• The second  administrative  interim analysis will be performed when [ADDRESS_784761] 
completed 8 weeks in the study  
• Administrative i nterim analyses may be omitted or added at the discretion of the 
Sponsor to allow for long term planning, and to assess ending the study  early .

Version 4.0, 30 Sep 2021 4 This amendment updates and supersedes  Amendment 1 dated 24 -May-2021.  
 
Modifications made to the protocol as a part of Amendment 2 and a brief rationale for the 
changes are summarized below.   
 
Major Revisions include:   
 
• Update to Data Safety and Monitoring Board (Section [IP_ADDRESS])  
• Removed requirement of pause to enrollment wh ile the DSMB reviews safety data from 
the first [ADDRESS_784762] party T cells (VSTs) when used to treat BK virus following kidney transplant. 
Moreover, the on -going ALVR105 studies of initial treated HCT patients show no 
reported cases of graft -versus -host disease (GVHD) and/or cytokine release syndrome  
(CRS), and the infusions were well tolera ted. 
 
AMENDMENT 1 : RATIONALE  FOR CHANGES   
  
This amendment updates and supersedes  P-105-201 Original Protocol, dated 06 July 202 0, as 
follows:   
  
Modifications made to the protocol as a part of Amendment 1 and a brief rationale for the 
change s are summarized below.   
  
Major Revisions include:   
 
• Updates to Schedule of Activities  (Section 1.3)  
• Shorten ed maximum screening period from 21 to 14 days . This was done  given the 
change to allow a single viral load  at the central lab to qualify a patient, assuming th e 
patient’s viral load  at the local lab (done as standard of care)  is  
copi[INVESTIGATOR_014] /mL for Cohort A.  
• Delete d CMV viral load  from screening  as the CMV -based  exclusion criteria has been 
removed.  
• Amended  language to  allow for up to 3  home health  visits for  clinical and viral load 
assessments in the follow up period after the initial 12 week dosing  period . This is done 
to minimize visits to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_594848] -19 pandemic, except when 
necessary for dosing  in the initial 12 week period . 
• Deleted language around locally obtained donor specific antibodies as these are no 
longer required to qualify  since they  are obtained in the study . 
• Visit window days have been changed from 14 days to  7 days for weeks 14 to 24, as 
visits are every 2 weeks during this period of time.  
  
• Revisions to Inclusion and Exclusion criteria to broaden enrollment  (section 5.1 and 5.2  
and in Synopsis ) 

AlloVir  
Clinical Study Protocol P -105-201 
Confidential & Proprietary   
Version 4.0, 30 Sep 2021 5 • Updated the inclusion criteria to remove the [ADDRESS_784763] -
transplant window to also be eligible.  
• Updated the inclusion criteria to eliminate the exc lusion for > 12 weeks of BK viremia 
to also allow participation of patients with stable persistent BK viremia of greater than 
12 weeks duration.  
• Eliminate d the exclusion for > 12 weeks of BK viremia  to allow participation of patients 
with stable persistent  BK viremia  of greater than 12 weeks duration.  
• Remove d the [ADDRESS_784764]-transp lant window t o be eligible.  
• Remove d exclu sion for  patients with donor specific  antibodies  at transplant  since the 
data on these antibodies can be accurately compared between central lab data obtained 
at randomization and subsequently.  
• Added belatacept to the list of prohibited medication s. 
 
• Study treatment  prepar ation (section 6.1.2) now refers to the Cell Therapy Manual  
• IP preparation and infusion procedure description has been removed from the protocol, 
and referral to the Cell Therapy Manual has been added, as the IP management is more 
extensively described in the Cell Therapy Man ual.  
 
• Study treatment withdrawal (section 7.1) versus patient  discontinuation (section 7.2) 
after receipt of a prohibited study treatment or after pregnancy . 
• Clarified by [CONTACT_594891] s 7.1 and 7.2 that patients who receive a prohibited 
medication or become pregnant may continue in the study for the purposes of observation 
but are ineligible to receive study treatment.  
 
• CHARMS study data in section [IP_ADDRESS] is now refer enced  to the IB . 
• As ALVR105 safety and efficacy data from the CHARMS study is more  extensively 
described in the investigational brochure (IB), the specific data have been removed from 
section [IP_ADDRESS] and refer ence to the IB has been added.  
 
• Miscellaneous revisions to reflect administrative changes , correct typographical errors , 
or refer  to current study documents such as the IB . 
• Changed references to the study treatment  from Viralym -M to ALVR105 to conform to 
other Allovir  protocols.   
• Removed transmission of infectious agent from the list of SAE examples to avoid 
confusion over whether such an event would always be an SAE.  
• Corrected typo graphical error that omitted a line  in CTCAE grading to  now include 
Grade 5 SAE.  
• Added names of certain the laboratory chemistry values obtained in the study to be 
consistent with the lab oratory  manual.

Version 4.0, 30 Sep 2021 25 2 INTRODUCTION  
AlloVir is developi[INVESTIGATOR_594857] ( PSL, ALVR105 , formerly  Viralym -M), a novel multivirus -
specific cellular therapy, to treat a number of serious, virus -associated causes of morbidity and 
mortality after transplant, including those caused by [CONTACT_594894] 
([BKV ] and the related polyomavirus JC vi rus [JCV]), cytomegalovirus ( CMV ), human 
herpesvirus 6 (HHV -6), Epstein -Barr virus (EBV ), and adenovirus (AdV ). 
PSL (ALVR105)  is a biological product consisting of PSL cells (third -party, multivirus -specific 
T cells with specificity for BKV, JCV, AdV, HHV -6, EBV, and CMV) in cryopreservation  
medi a.  
2.[ADDRESS_784783] viral infections . In 
transplant  recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], the use of potent immunosuppressive regimens (and subsequent associated 
immune compromise) leaves patients susceptible to severe viral infections  and diseases . Viral 
infections are maj or causes of mortality and morbidity , and they have become  leading  etiolog ies 
for -transplant -related  mortality.  
BKV  is a polyomavirus that causes disease primarily in immunocompromised individuals. After 
primary infection, the virus remains latent in geni tourinary cells. In immunosuppressed kidney 
transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], the virus can reactivate and cause tubulointerstitial nephritis, and in some  
cases, ureteral stenosis ( Goldberg 2016 ). Nephropathy  secondary to BKV infec tion occurs in up 
to 10% of transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] ( Jawdeh 2017 ) and is usually seen within the first year  following 
transplantation . There are no US Food and Drug Administration ( FDA )-approved therapi[INVESTIGATOR_594858]. The current t reatment consists of reduction in 
immunosuppression with close monitoring of allograft func tion; however, immunosuppression 
reduction may expose kidney transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_594859] .  
The cellular immune response to BK V plays a critical role in the control of BK virus replication. 
Several immune parameters predict an increased risk of high -level BK viremia; these include a 
low pre-transplant CD4+ T cell count (DeWolfe 2017 ), indicators of T cell exhaustion such as T 
cells with lower production of protective cytokines  and interferon  (IFN) -ɣ (Mueller 2011 ), and a 
lower number of  BKV-specific polyfunctional CD8+ T cells ( Schmidt 2014 ). 
Thus, development of a n adoptively -transferred T cell  treatment , such as  PSL, may meet an 
unmet medical need for BKV infection  in kidney transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] .

2.3.2 Overview of Clinical Studies with Virus -Specific T Cells  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Results of an Initial Phase [ADDRESS_784785], in pediatric and adult allogeneic hematopoietic cell 
transplant (HCT ) recipi[INVESTIGATOR_594860]  (Tzannou 2019 ). Similar to PSL, 
Viralym -C is generated from peripheral blood mononuclear cell s (PBMCs ) after expansion in the 
presence of overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_594861]. Unlike PSL, Viralym -C is only directed 
against a single virus , CMV. Although Viralym -C is a single  virus -specific  T cell product, the 
results of this study support the safety and efficacy of AlloVir’s  allogeneic,  virus -specific  T cell 
products when used in a clinical setting. Briefly, a bank of [ADDRESS_784786] 95% of potential patients. Ten 
patients were treated with Viralym -C: each patient r eceived a single intravenous ( IV) infusion of 
2×107 partially human leukocyte antigen (HLA )-matched virus -specific  T cells/m2 with the 
option to receive a second infusion after [ADDRESS_784787] disease (GVHD ). Based on viral load 
(measured by [CONTACT_137414]  [qPCR] ) and/or resolution of signs and/or 
symptoms, Viralym -C appeared to control CMV infections in all patients with 8  complete 
responses (CRs) and 2 partial responses (PRs) achieved within  4 weeks of infusion. One patient 
with CMV retinitis had complete resolution of disease following Viralym -C infusion.

tolerated dose (MTD) level. Upon the completion of Phase 1, additional patients were accrued at 
the MTD level to evaluate a clinically relevant endpoint for antiviral activity in Phase 2.  
Patients received   donor -derived multivirus -specif ic cytotoxic T 
lymphocytes (CTLs)/m2 in a single infusion in the dose -escalation phase of the study, and  
multivirus -specific  CTLs/m2 for the fixed -dose Phase 2 efficacy component (actual number of 
cells infused ranged between    cells per patient). Patients were followed for 
toxicity for 30 days, GVHD for 6  weeks, and antiviral responses for 3 months; long -term follow -
up continued for 12  months following the final CTL infusion.  
A total of 21 patients were enrolled, and all 21 patients  completed the study. All doses were well 
tolerated. There were no adverse events (AEs) experienced by [CONTACT_594895]. Three patients developed Stage 2 skin GVHD (Grade  1 
overall) and 1 patient develop ed Stage 3 skin GVHD (Grade 2 overall) in the 6 -week initial 
follow -up period; all patients  responded to topi[INVESTIGATOR_8826].  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Results of the CHARMS Study with Third Party -Derived Multivirus -Specific 
T Cells, Posoleucel (Multivirus -specific T Cells for the Tre atment of Virus 
Infections After Stem Cell Transplant ) 
To investigate the safety and clinical efficacy of PSL, a multivirus -specific T cell product 
reactive for BKV, AdV, HHV -6, EBV, and CMV generated from third -party, healthy donors, a 
Phase 1/2a clinical  study was conducted in recipi[INVESTIGATOR_594863] ≥1 of the 5 viruses targeted by [CONTACT_594896]. In this study, patients received a single IV 
infusion of 2 107 partially HLA -matched PSL cells/m2, with the option to receive a second 
infusion after 4  weeks (actual range 14 days to >6 weeks) and additional infusions at biweekly 
intervals thereafter. Therapy with standard antiviral medications could be continued at the 
discretion of the treating physician.  
A total of [ADDRESS_784789] were infused 
with PSL cell lines matched at 1 to 6 HLA antigens; 54 of these patients completed study 
treatment and the initial 28 -day safety follow -up (the first 38 patients to complete the study ar e 
reported in  Tzannou 2017 ). For additional information on PSL, refer to the current Investigator’s 
Brochure (IB).  
In addition to patients with post -HCT CMV, EBV, AdV, BKV, and HHV -6-associated 
infections, patients with J CV infections were also enrolled in this Phase 1/[ADDRESS_784790] -party BKV -specific T cells 
could pr oduce similar results in 3 immunosuppressed patients with progressive multifocal 
leukoencephalopathy (PML ). Post -infusion, [ADDRESS_784791] patient had a reduction in JCV load and 
stabilization of symptoms  (Muftuoglu 2018 ). Given these promising results in the context of a 
complete lack of proven antiviral medications effective against JCV and the potentially 
devastating natural history  associated with JCV, activity of PSL in patients with JCV viremia  
will be monitored in this study .

Version 4.0, 30 Sep 2021 28 2.4 Benefit /Risk Assessment  
More detailed information about the known and expected benefits and risks and reasonably 
expected AEs of PSL may be found in the IB. 
2.4.1 Potential Benefits  
A serious unmet medical need exists for patients experiencing viral infections and diseases such 
as BKV -associated nephropathy. Up to 10% of kidney transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_594864] s ≥10,000 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL, a level that is  predictive of an allograft biopsy indicating  BK 
virus -associated nephropathy ( Hirsch 2013 ; Bohl 2007 ; Schachtner 2015 ), which can progress to 
graft loss ( Gardner 1984 ). Even with the best current treatments (principally immunosuppression 
reduction), many centers report allograft nephropathy, rejection, and graft failure more 
commonly than in non -BK viremic patients ( Favi 2019 ; El-Husseini 2019 ; Sawinski 2015 ). 
There are no FDA - or European Medicines Agency -approved antiviral therapi[INVESTIGATOR_594865] . The CHARMS study and other related 
clinical studies strongly suggest that PSL is a safe and effective broad -spectrum therapy to treat 
commonly  observed, severe virus -associated disease in immunocompromised patients . The 
results of these studies provide preliminary evidence of PSL’s  efficacy in multiple opportunistic 
viral infections , including BKV,  in immunocompromised patients . Since standard of care 
immunosuppression reduction in response to persistent high -level BK virem ia has been 
associated with the development of donor -specific antibodies and graft rejection  (Sawinski 
2015 ), a therapy such as PSL has the potential to be better than that of standard  of care 
immunosuppression reduction . 
2.4.2 Potential Risks  
PSL primarily targets cells infected with AdV, BKV (and/or JCV), CMV, EBV, and/or HHV -6. 
The main risks of administration are inflammation at sites of disease or GVHD due to cross 
reactivity with the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]’s HLA antigens . Adverse events attributable to virus -specific  T cell 
administration may potentially occur in a small percentage of the treated population. These can 
include both hematologic and non -hematologic effects, as reported in the CHARMS study.  
Studies of donor -derived virus -specific T cells suggest that virus -specific  T cells do not persist in 
patients who receive methylprednisolone in doses 1 mg/kg/day. Therefore, if patients develop 
severe inflammatory reactions thought to be attributable to PSL, a therapeutic option is to 
administer methylprednisolone (1 to 2 mg/kg/day). In patients who develop skin rash or skin 
GVHD, excellent responses have been seen with administration of topi[INVESTIGATOR_8826].  
As with other biological therapi[INVESTIGATOR_594866], possible side effects  of PSL infusion 
include allergic reaction (anaphylaxis), decreased oxygenation, nausea/vomiting, arrhythmia, and 
hypotension . 
A detailed breakdown of the time  points for blood sample collection  during the course of this 
study is provided in in Section 1.3.  
In order to minimize the volume of blood collected during the study, the blood volume of 
individual samples has been reduced to the maximum extent feasible. This has been done in a 
manner that is expected to maintain the scientific integrity of the study while minimizing the 
risks to patients.

Version 4.0, 30 Sep 2021 32 4 STUDY DESIGN  
4.1 Overall  Design  
This is a Phase 2, multicenter, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled , multiple dosing 
interval, 2-period  study of the safety, tolerability and efficacy of adoptively transferred PSL 
virus -specific T cells in kidney transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_594871].  
This study is comprised of 2 periods. Period  1 includes a 2-week window for screening 
assessments followed by a 12 -week treatment period for eligible patients. Period 2 consists of a  
12-week follow -up. Overall, the total duratio n of patient participation in the study is 
approximately 26 weeks ( 2 weeks for screening, 12 weeks of treatment, and 12 weeks of follow -
up). The overall enrollment period is anticipated to be approximately 12  months.  
The protocol defines standardized conse nsus guidelines for the type of immunosuppression 
reduction in order to s ystemat ize the approach to immunosuppression reduction across sites 
(Appen dix 7, Section  10.7). Administration of PSL in the active arms of the study may result in 
fewer patients meeting the criteria for initiation or intensification of immunosuppression 
reduction according to the prot ocol at their institution than in the placebo arm of the study, and 
changes to each patient’s immunosuppression will be monitored.  
Patients who meet all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be 
randomized to receive PSL or placebo infusions.  Patients will be stratified  
 
 
 Patients will be monitored following randomization for safety, BK viral load, renal 
function , and immune function, including modification  of immunosuppression reduction.  
Patients will receive infusions of either PSL or placebo for 12 weeks . The specific PSL cell line 
for infusion will be selected  
 
. Cryopreservat ion media (without cells) will serve as the placebo and will be 
identical in volume and appearance upon administration. All infusions will be administered 
intravenously ( IV) (via peripheral or central line) over approximately  as a slow push. 
Patients will receive the same dose for all infusions.  
The study  will consist of 3 treatment arms. To maintain the blind, all patients will receive an 
infusion (either PSL or placebo)  
 The treatment arms and associated infusions for 
Cohort A are as follow:

Administrative interim analyses are planned for the study . The Sponsor’s study team and 
Investigators will remain blinded to individual patient data during and after the administrative 
interim analyses.  The first interim analysis will be performed  by [CONTACT_594890]  [ADDRESS_784796] completed 8 weeks in the study . Interim analyses may be 
omitted or added  at the discretion of the Sponsor to allow for long term planning, and to assess 
ending the study  or either arm  early , as described in the statistical analysis plan (SAP) . See 
Figure  [ADDRESS_784797] 2 weeks apart will discontinue PSL infusion s. If a patient’s viral 
load becomes undetectable, such a  patient may be followed every 14 days for study evaluations 
as per the Schedule of Activities  (Section  1.3). No patients are permitte d to receive a subsequent 
infusion of PSL if they develop new onset GVHD  (≥Stage 1; see Appendix 5, Section 10.5) or 
cytokine release syndrome (CRS ) (>Grade  2; see Appendix 6, Section  10.6) at the proposed time 
for infusion of any subsequent dose.  
An independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB ) will be convened for this study to 
routinely monitor patient safety and evaluate prespecified interim analyses  to stop the study early 
(see Section  10.1.5 ). 
4.[ADDRESS_784798] current treatments (principally immunosuppression reduction), many centers 
report a llograft nephropathy, rejection , and graft failure more commonly  in patients with BK  
viremia  than in those without  (Favi 2019 , El-Husse ini 2019 , Sawinski  2015 ). The unmet medical 
need in BK virus nephropathy is reflected in the continue d use of (ineffective) antiviral 
treatments such as leflunomide, cidofovir, intravenous immunoglobulin G,  and levofloxacin 
concurrently with immunosuppression  reduction ( Bruminhent 2019 ). 
PSL multivirus -specific T cells target BK virus infected cells, and thus offer a way to lower viral 
load in BK viremic kidney transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841] s at risk for BK nephropathy . To date,  
immunosuppression reduction  is the only therapy that  has succeeded in lowering BK viral load , 
and even it has had limited success  and can lead to increased risk of rejection and/or production 
of donor -specific antibodies . This proof -of-concept  study will also identify the dos ing interval 
for virus -specific T  cell infusions needed to lower viral load  in kidney transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841] s on 
continued immunosuppression  and potentially limit the damage caused by [CONTACT_594899] . 
The use of placebo in this clinical  study is justified for the following reasons:  
1) A placebo control group is required to provide an objective, contemporaneous assessment 
of the therapeutic effects and AE profile of PSL. 
2) The use of an active control group in the study is not feasible since there are no approved, 
efficacious antiviral therapi[INVESTIGATOR_594872] .

Version 4.0, 30 Sep 2021 34 3) Investigators are permitted to administer standard of care immunosuppression reduction 
as per the algorithm included in  Appendix 7 ( Section 10.7). 
4.3 Justification for Dose  
PSL is to be administered at a fixed cell dose. The fixed dose was selected based on data from 
previous clinical studies in which PSL cells were well tolerated, safe, and effective.  
    
   
 
  
The use of PSL in a solid organ transplant population that may be receiving  several different 
chronic immunosuppressive agents justifies the need for dose interval ranging in this study.  
 
 
 
 
; to date, there are no data for the use 
of PSL in the setting of solid organ transplant . The use of other T cell regimens for the treatment 
of viral infections specific to the solid organ transplant setting has demonstrated preliminary 
efficacy and safety when cell are administered weekly for [ADDRESS_784799] , depending on the presence or absence of disease progression ( Prockop 2019 ). Two-
week  -Virus -Specific  T cell dosing intervals have  been described in several studies in which  
suppression of BK viral load  was observed ; however, an incomplete and/or delayed virologic 
response was often observed  (Flower 2020 ).  
 
 
 
 
 During this time , clinical safety and viral load will be monitored very 
closely by [CONTACT_4318]. T cell persistence data will also be collected.   
4.4 End of Study Definition  
The end of the study (“study completion”) is defined as the date of the last protocol -specified 
visit/assessment (including telephone contact) for the last patient in the study.  
A patient  is considered to have completed the study if he/she has completed all phases of the

6.1.2 Study Treatment  Administration  
Randomization of patients to PSL versus  placebo will occur only after cell line matching and 
selection has been confirmed (to satisfy inclusion criteria).  
Premedication is not required, except for patients  with a prior history of reaction to blood 
products . These patients may  receive  premedication with 0.25 to 0.5 mg/kg (maximum dose of 
25 mg) diphenhydramine  (IV or oral)  and/or 5 to 10 mg/kg (maximum dose of 1000 mg) 
acetaminophen  (IV or oral)  prior to study treatment administration. Premedication with 
corticosteroids is prohibited . 
At or close to the time of administration, the product will be thawed.  For further details on 
product preparation prior to infusion, please see the  Cell Therapy Manual.  
Patients will be monitored according to institutional standards for the administration of blood 
products and, at a minimum, according to the following requirements:  
• Patients in an outpatient setting must remain in the clinic for 1 hour after the end of the 
infusion.  
• Patients must remain on continuous pulse oximetry for 30 minutes after the  end of the 
infusion.  
• Vital signs will be monitored within 30 minutes prior to the infusion, at the end of infusion, 
and at 15, 30, 45, and 60 (±5) minutes after the end of the infusion.  
All findings must be recorded in the electronic case report form (eCRF ). 
Patients will receive supportive care for acute or chronic toxicity, including blood components, 
antibiotics, or other interventions as appropriate per local treatment guidelines. See Section  6.8.2  
for additional information.  
If a patient experiences an  infusion reaction, 0.25 to 0.5 mg/kg (maximum dose of 25 mg) 
diphenhydramine (IV or oral) and/or 5 to 10 mg/kg (maximum dose of 1000  mg) acetaminophen 

AlloVir

Version 4.0, 30 Sep 2021 42 (IV or oral) may be administered as treatment . The maximum recommended single and daily 
doses of diphenhydramine and acetaminophen should not be exceeded.  In the case of sub optimal 
control of an infusion reaction or the need to use corticosteroids for treatment of an infusion 
reaction, doses of 0.5mg/kg/day of prednisone or equivalent should be considered first . 
6.2 Preparation/Handling/Storage/Accountability  
1. The Investigator  or designee must confirm appropriate temperature conditions have been

Version 4.0, 30 Sep 2021 43 6.3 Measures to Minimize Bias: Randomization and Blinding  
This study is blinded to safeguard  the integrity of the AE determination process, and to ensure 
that decisions regarding discontinuation of infusions for apparent efficacy are made in an 
unbiased fashion.  
Study using 
IVRS/IWRS  All patient s will be centrally assigned to randomized study treatment  
using an Interactive Voice/Web Response System (IVRS/IWRS). Before 
the study is initiated, the telephone number and call -in directions for the 
IVRS and/or the log in information and directions for the IWRS will be 
provided to each site.  
Study treatment  will be dispensed at the study visits summarized in the 
Schedule of Activitie s (SOA, Section  1.3). 
The Sponsor designee ( eg, interactive response technology [IRT] vendor) will have a designated 
randomization administrator who will maintain the randomization codes in accordance with 
standard operating procedures to ensure the blind integrity is properly maintained. Care should 
be exercised to ensure that only Sponso r personnel who require knowledge of treatment 
assignments will be unblinded ( eg, staff involved in Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse 
Reaction [S[LOCATION_003]R] reporting).  
Blind Break 
(IVRS/IWRS)  The IVRS/IWRS will be programmed with blind -breaking instructions.  
In case of an emergency, the Investigator  has the sole responsibility for 
determining if unblinding of a patient s’ intervention assignment is 
warranted. Patient  safety must always be the first consideration in 
making such a determination. If the Investigator  decides that 
unblinding is warranted, the Investigator  should make every effort to 
contact [CONTACT_594905] a patient ’s intervention 
assignment unless this could delay emergency treatment of the patient . 
If a patient ’s intervent ion assignment is unblinded, the Sponsor  must 
be notified within [ADDRESS_784808] be recorded in the source 
documentation and case report form, as applicable.  
Unblinding should only occur in the event of an emergency or AE for which it is necessary to 
know the study treatment to determine an appropriate course of therapy. If the patient’s study 
treatment must be unblinded, the Investigator or qualified designee should contact [CONTACT_594906]. The IRT documentation indicating the blind break at the site must 
be retained with the patient’s source documentation in such a way as to avoid unblinding the 
treatment assignment to other site or Spo nsor blinded personnel.  
If possible, the Investigator should attempt to contact [CONTACT_47994]. If 
not possible, the Investigator should notify the Medical Monitor as soon as possible of the 
unblinding without disclosing the treatm ent assignment of the unblinded patient. The 
Investigator must document the patient’s identification, the reason for breaking the blind, and the 
date and time for breaking the blind. Following unblinding, the Investigator must withdraw the 
patient from the  study.

Clinical Study Protocol P -105-201 
Confidential & Proprietary   
Version 4.0, 30 Sep 2021 44 6.4 Study Treatment  Compliance  
When patient s are dosed at the site, they will receive study treatment  directly from the 
Investigator  or designee, under medical supervision. The date and time of each dose 
administered in the clinic will be recorded in t he source documents  and on the appropriate eCRF . 
The dose of study treatment  and study patient  identification will be confirmed at the time of 
dosing by a member of the study site staff other than the person administering the study 
treatment . 
6.5 Dose Modification  
This section is not applicable.  
6.5.1 Retreatment Criteria  
As GVHD is a theoretical safety concern, the incidence and severity of GVHD will be monitored 
during the study. No patients will be permitted to receive a subsequent  infusion of PSL if they 
develop new onset GVHD  (≥Stage 1; see Appendix 5, Section 10.5) or CRS  (>Grade 2; see 
Appendix 6, Section  10.6). 
After the first [ADDRESS_784809] 2 weeks apart will discontinue PSL infusions.  If a patient’s viral 
load becomes undetectable in this way  such patients may be followed every 14  days for study 
evaluations as per the SoA (Section  1.3). 
6.[ADDRESS_784810] dose of PSL (or placebo) after Week  12. 
However, patients will continue in the study for evaluation of safety, efficacy, and other 
endpoints for an additional 12 week s. 
6.7 Treatment of Overdose  
For this study, any dose of PSL greater than cells within a 24-hour period (±1 hour) will 
be considered an overdose.  
As there is no antidote, the Sponsor  does not recommend specific treatment for an overdose . 
In the event of an overdose, the Investigator  should:  
• Contact [CONTACT_27465].  
• Evaluate the patient  to determine, in consultation with the Medical Monitor, whether 
study treatment  should be interrupted or whether the dose interval should be extended . 
• Closely monitor the patient  for any AE/SAE and laboratory abnormalities until  the next 
dosing day . 
• Document the quantity of the excess dose as well as the duration of the overdose.  
6.8 Concomitant Therapy  
All medications, including transplant immunosuppression , used within 30 days before screening 
will be recorded. All concomitant medications and concurrent therapi[INVESTIGATOR_594876] P -105-201 
Confidential & Proprietary   
Version 4.0, 30 Sep 2021 45 indicated in Section 1.3. Dose, route, unit frequency of administration, indication for 
administration, and dates of medication will also be captured in source documents and on the 
appropriate eCRF . 
Clinically available ( ie, not investigational) antiviral agents prescribed for other infections, such 
as foscarnet and ganciclovir to treat CMV, are allowed. Data on their use will be collected along 
with other concomitant medications.  
Standard of care immunosuppression reduction is permitted as per the g uidelines for the type of 
immunosuppression reduction that are provided in Appendix 7 (Section 10.7). The typi[INVESTIGATOR_594877], which includes a calcineurin 
inhibitor, an anti -metabolite, commonly mycophenolate mofetil or mycophenolic acid, with or 
without low dose prednisone, is included in Section 10.7, Figure 2. If a patient’s 
immunosuppression regimen  includes sirolimus or everolimus, a change in these agents based on 
BK viral load is not usually made; for this reason they are not included in Figure 2, and patients 
taking these medications who require changes in dose of their sirolimus or everolimus will 
require discussion with the Medical Monitor. These guidelines should be followed in order to 
standardize the approach to immunosuppression  across sites.  Administration of PSL in the active 
arms of the study may result in fewer patients meeting the cri teria for modification  of 
immunosuppression reduction according to the protocol at their institution than in the placebo 
arm of the study, and changes to each patient’s immunosuppression will be monitored and may 
be summarized as an exploratory endpoint.  
6.8.1 Excluded Medications and/or Procedures  
All patients may receive available supportive therapy with approved treatments, but initiation of 
therapy for the attempted treatment of BK virus  infection  with sirolimus, everolimus,  cidofovir, 
brincidofovir, fluoroqu inolones ( eg, ciprofloxacin), intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) or 
leflunomide during the first 12  weeks after randomization is prohibited.  
Receipt of other investigational antiviral treatments ( eg, anti-BK virus monoclonal antibodies) 
within 28 days or 5  half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to randomization and throughout the 
duration of the study is prohibited.  
T cell ablative therapi[INVESTIGATOR_594878], alemtuzumab (Campath -1H), or other 
immunosuppressive T cell -targeted monoclonal antibodies are prohibited during the study. Daily 
doses of corticosteroids exceeding 0.5 mg/kg prednisone (or equivalent) are also prohibited 
during the study.  
6.8.2 Supportive Care 
The following supportive care measures are permitted:

All AEs and SAEs will be collected at the time points specified in the SoA ( Section 1.3) from 
randomization  until study participation is complete . 
Medical occurrences that begin before randomization  but after obtaining informed consen t will 
be recorded as Medical History/Current Medical Conditions, not as AEs. 
All SAEs will be recorded and reported to the Sponsor  or designee immediately and under no 
circumstance should this exceed 24 hours, as indicated in Appendix 3  (Section 10.3). The 
Investigator  will submit any updated SAE data to the Sponsor  within [ADDRESS_784819] ively seek information on AEs or SAEs after conclusion of 
the study participation . However, if the Investigator  learns of any SAE, including a death, at any 
time after a patient  has been discharged from the study, and he/she considers the event to be 
reaso nably related to the study treatment  or study participation, the Investigator  must promptly 
notify the Sponsor . 
8.3.2 Method of Detecting AEs and SAEs  
Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AEs and/or SAEs. Open -ended and 
non-leading verbal questioning of the patient  is the preferred method to inquire about 
AE occurrences.  
8.3.3 Follow -up of AEs and SAEs  
After the initial AE/SAE report, the Investigator  is required to proactively follow each patient  at 
subsequent visits/contacts. All  SAEs  and AEs of special interest (as defined in Section  8.3.7 ), 
will be followed until resolution, stabilization, the event is otherwise explained, or the patient  is 
lost to follow -up (as defined in Section  7.3). Further information on follow -up procedures is 
provided in Appendix 3  (Section 10.3). 
8.3.4 Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SAEs

appropriate form and submit it to  the Sponsor  within 24 hours  of learning of the 
pregnancy  of the female patient  or female partner of  a male patient  (after obtaining the 
necessary signed informed consent from the f emale partner).  
• While pregnancy itself is not considered to be an AE or SAE, any pregnancy 
complication or elective termination of a pregnancy for medical reasons will be reported 
as an AE or SAE.  
• Abnormal pregnancy outcomes ( eg, spontaneous abortion, feta l death, stillbirth, 
congenital anomalies, ectopic pregnancy) are considered SAEs and will be reported as 
such.  
• The female patient  or pregnant female partner of a male patient  will be followed to 
determine the outcome of the pregnancy. The Investigator  will collect follow -up 
information on the female patient or pregnant female partner of a male patient and the 
neonate and the information will be forwarded to the Sponsor .

patients receiving  placebo, based on quantitation of viremia performed at the central laboratory.  
9.4.4 Tertiary/Exploratory Endpoint(s)  
Exploratory continuous and categorical efficacy endpoints will be summarized descriptively by 
[CONTACT_594914] I ntent -to-Treat (I TT) Population. Categorical 
endpoints will be summarized using number and percentage of patients within each category. For 
time-to-event variables, the Kaplan -Meier method will be used to estimate the median time 
(days) and its 95% confidence in terval . 
9.4.5 Safety  Analysis  
All safety data will be summarized by [CONTACT_594915] . Categorical endpoints 
will be summarized using number and percentage of patients within each category. Continuous 
endpoints will be summarized descriptively with  summary statistics (number, mean, standard 
deviation, standard error, median, first quartile, third quartile, minimum, and maximum).  
Adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities. A TEAE is 
defined as an AE with a sta rt date and time on or after the first dose of study treatment  and 
through the Week 24 visit . Treatment -emergent AEs  will be summarized by [CONTACT_594916] (according to the National Cancer Institute [NCI] 
Commo n Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE] v5.0) and relationship to study 
treatment. The incidence of SAEs  will be summarized.  
The incidence of AESIs including acute GVHD, CRS , infusion reactions and their corresponding 
exact binomial confidence in tervals with 95% confidence level will be presented by [CONTACT_6490].  Grading criteria for GVHD and CRS are in Appendix [ADDRESS_784828] -baseline value

baseline in laboratory parameters, vital sign param eters, and quantitative ECG parameters will be 
summarized. Selected laboratory parameters will be summarized in shift tables.  
Statistical comparisons will be carried out using Fisher’s exact test and Student’s  t test. A 1 -sided  
P < .05 will be considered s tatistically significant. Key secondary outcomes such as BK viral load 
assessments  and change in eGFR  (measured by [CONTACT_594917]) between the placebo group and treatment group will be analyzed using the statistical 
comparisons described above. The baseline demographics of patient s, such as age and gender, 
etc., will also be analyzed to ensure adequate randomization.  
9.4.6 Other Analyses

Woman of Childbearing Potential (WOCBP)  
Women in the following categories are considered WOCBP (fertile):  
1. Following menarche  
2. From the time of m enarche until becoming post -menopausal unless permanently sterile 
(see below)  
• A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative 
medical cause.  
o A high follicle -stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range 
may be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal 
contraception or hormonal replacement therapy (HRT). However, in the absence 
of [ADDRESS_784838] discontinue 
HRT to allow confirmation of postmenopausal status before study enrollment.  
• Permanent sterilization methods (for the purpose of this study) include:  
o Documented hysterectomy  
o Documented bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656]  
o Docume nted bilateral oophorectomy  
o For individuals with permanent infertility due to an alternate medical cause other 
than the above,  (eg, Mullerian agenesis, androgen insensitivity, gonadal 
dysgenesis), Investigator  discretion should be applied to determining study entry.  
Note:  Documentation can come from the site personnel’s review of the patient ’s medical 
records, medical examination, or medical history interview.  
• If fertility is unclear ( eg, amenorrhea in adolesce nts or athletes) and a menstrual cycle 
cannot be confirmed before first dose of study treatment , additional evaluation should 
be considered.  
Woman of Nonchildbearing Potential (WONCBP)  
Women in the following categories are considered WONCBP:  
3. Premenopausal female with permanent infertility due to one of the following:

a. A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative 
medical cause.  
i. A high FSH level in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a 
postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or HRT. 
However, in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, confirmation with more 
than one FSH measurement >40 IU/L or mIU /mL is required.

Note: Organ toxicities associated with CRS may be graded according to CTCAE v5.0 but they do not influence CRS grading.  
Note: Grade 5 CRS is defined as death due to CRS , in which another cause is not the principle factor leading t o the outcome.  
1  Fever is defined as temperature 38.0C not attributable to any other cause. In patients who have CRS and then receive 
antipyretic or anticytokine therapy such as tocilizumab or steroids, fever is no longer required to grade subsequent CRS 
severity. In this case, CRS grading is driven by [CONTACT_13199]/or hypoxia.  
2  CRS grade is determined by [CONTACT_13200]: hypotension or hypoxia not attributable to any other cause. For example, 
a patient with temperature of 39.5 C, hypotension  requiring 1 vasopressor, and hypoxia requiring low -flow nasal cannula is 
classified as grade 3 CRS.

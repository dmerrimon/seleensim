2.0 Background 
2.1 Scientific Background and Gaps
Thoracic surgery is associated with significant postoperative pain and providing adequate 
analgesia in these patients is essential for enhanced recovery protocols1. Regional anesthesia 
STUDY00008641
Approval: 2/23/2024
Page 3 of 19 (V.04/27/2017) techniques, such as thoracic epi[INVESTIGATOR_287909], are therefore 
commonly employed 2. These techniques have limitations however; they require a high degree of 
technical expertise, are contraindicated if the patient has a coagulopathy, and are associated with 
significant adverse effects and risk of complications. These include, but are not limited to 
hypotension, pneumothorax, and epi[INVESTIGATOR_287910]. We recently 
described a novel ultrasound-guided regional anesthetic technique for providing thoracic 
analgesia, the ultrasound-guided Erector Spi[INVESTIGATOR_104902] (ESP) block. The ESP block involves 
injection of local anesthetic into the musculofascial plane deep (anterior) to the erector spi[INVESTIGATOR_287911] (posterior) to the tip of the transverse processes of the thoracic spi[INVESTIGATOR_050]. Our 
radiological and anatomical investigation in fresh adult cadavers has shown that injection of a 
clinically-relevant volume (20ml) at the T5 vertebral level produces extensive spread of injectate 
within the erector spi[INVESTIGATOR_287912], along the Para spi[INVESTIGATOR_287913], 
and extending between C4 and T12 vertebral levels 3. This corresponds with early clinical 
experience indicating that the ESP block is effective in treating chronic thoracic pain3, acute 
post-thoracic surgical pain 4-6, and pain from rib fractures 7. It thus appears to provide similar 
analgesia to a thoracic paravertebral block, while being technically simpler and safer to perform. 
The ESP block therefore has promise as a simple, safe, yet highly effective method of providing 
thoracic analgesia, and one that can be learned and performed by [CONTACT_287941]. 
2.2 Previous Data
Ultrasound-guided ESP injections of a clinically relevant volume (20 mL) of normal saline (with 
iodinated contrast and methylene blue) at the T5 vertebral level were performed in fresh 
cadavers. The cadavers underwent computed tomography imaging and anatomical dissection. 
The radiological and anatomical findings demonstrated a distribution of injectate within the 
erector spi[INVESTIGATOR_287912], along the Para spi[INVESTIGATOR_287913], and 
extending between C4 and T12 vertebral levels [4]. It is unclear how the extent of spread may 
have been influenced by [CONTACT_287942], post mortem tissue desiccation, 
temperature difference, and lack of perfusion and respi[INVESTIGATOR_287914] a 
living subject. Even though the ESP block has not been studied extensively for evaluation of 
mechanism of action, there are a number of case reports and case series that have been published 
in the last year, where ESP has been shown to be safe in different conditions of use. [4-6] To 
date, there are [ADDRESS_350966] of those publications can be 
found using the following link: 
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=erector+spi[INVESTIGATOR_268362]+plane+block. Here at the Penn 
State Hershey Medical Center, more than two hundred of these blocks have been performed for 
different procedures, without any complications or side effects.
2.[ADDRESS_350967], the spread of 
injectate following the ESP block in live human subjects; second, the extent of sensory blockade 
that can be reliably expected; and third, the pharmacokinetics of local anesthetic injected into 
this location. It is also unknown what effect additives such as epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], might have on these 
parameters.  Epi[INVESTIGATOR_287915] (ESP) or similar 
peripheral fascial plane injections to produce local vasoconstriction in order to prolong the action 
of the ropi[INVESTIGATOR_10319].  The current evidence for the mechanism of action and efficacy of the ESP 
block in providing sensory blockade of the thorax comes from cadaveric studies and small 
patient case series.[4-6] For this potentially valuable regional anesthesia technique to be adopted 
more widely in clinical practice, it is essential to determine, with more precision, the mechanism 
of action in live human subjects, and the extent of sensory blockade that can be reliably achieved

although rare, is always a concern in regional anesthesia and it is, therefore, also important from 
a safety perspective to determine the pharmacokinetics associated with the ESP block, so as to 
provide appropriate guidelines for maximum dose, volume and concentration of local anesthetic 
to be injected. In addition, this knowledge will provide baseline data from which to embark upon 
comparative studies with other more established techniques for regional anesthesia of the thorax, 
such as thoracic epi[INVESTIGATOR_287916]. A volunteer study in non-anesthetized 
subjects offers the most controlled setting to study these factors, as it eliminates the confounding 
effects of concomitant analgesic and anesthetic medications, surgical trauma, and patient co-
morbidities.

7.1 Study Design
This will be a randomized, blinded, controlled study. 
This study will examine the effects of single injections  of 0.5% ropi[INVESTIGATOR_287918] (20 ml of each) injected at ESP at the T5 vertebra 
level.
7.1.1 Randomization process
The subjects enrolled will be randomized into two groups (6 participants in each group) by a 
computer-generated randomization list using SAS software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC):
Randomization groups  
1. Group RE will have 20mL of 0.5% Ropi[INVESTIGATOR_287919] 
T5 transverse process. 
2. Group R will have 20mL of 0.5% Ropi[INVESTIGATOR_287920] T5 transverse process.

Page 8 of 19 (V.04/27/2017) The randomization will be performed, using a sealed envelope technique, and will be stratified 
according to the side of the injections (either left or right) so that each arm will have equal 
number of left and right sided ESP blocks. This will be done by [CONTACT_287946]. All subjects, the anesthesiologist performing the procedure, the 
radiologist, and the research coordinator collecting the data will be blinded and will not be aware 
of the details of the injection and allocation of the participants. In the event that the patient has a 
concerning reaction or becomes unstable in any fashion, the patient will be immediately 
unblinded and removed from the study.

Study subjects will report to the Clinical Research Center (CRC) of Milton S. Hershey 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_287921].  Once they are checked in to CRC 
and ascertained that they followed fasting instructions, the female participants will be 
asked to take pregnancy test using a urine sample and a standardized pregnancy testing 
kit. Once the pregnancy test is determined to be negative, they will be considered to be a 
study participant. If pregnancy test is positive, they will be excluded from the study. 
Once the participant is included in to the study, an intravenous access and continuous 
monitoring of vital signs (ECG, non-invasive blood pressure every 5 minutes, and pulse 
oximetry) will be established.  [ADDRESS_350977] prior to performing the block. These samples will be

Laboratory (C2813, C2848) during the transport, blood samples will be placed in 
Category A sealed triple packaging. During transport, the specimen tubes will be placed 
in splash-proof and leak-proof containers. These primary containers are placed inside of 
secondary containers which will be sealed. The blood samples will be processed and

The additional blood from samples, if any, will be destroyed. 
The subject will be placed in a sitting position, the skin over their upper back will be 
disinfected with chlorhexidine 2%, and the tip of the T5 transverse process on one side 
will be identified using a low-frequency curvilinear ultrasound transducer (Sonosite, 
Bethesda, [LOCATION_003]) placed in a longitudinal parasagittal orientation as previously described. 
[4] The skin over the needle insertion site will be anesthetized with 2ml of lidocaine 1% 
conc. for patient comfort. A 22-gauge 10cm Tuohy needle (Stimuplex, BBraun, and 
Bethlehem, [LOCATION_003]) will be inserted in-plane with the ultrasound beam to contact [CONTACT_941] T5 
transverse process. One ml of 0.9% normal saline will be injected to confirm correct 
needle tip placement separating the ESP from transverse process, as evidenced by [CONTACT_287947][INVESTIGATOR_23367].  Injection of the specific volume and 
type of fluid according to the randomization group (see above) will then take place.  MRI 
part of study stopped May 2023. After the completion of the assigned injection they will 
be transported to the MRI suite at the MRI core facility on the Hershey campus in a 
wheel chair.  The subject will undergo two MRI’s to determine the spread of the 
anesthetic. These will take place at approximately 30 and 90 minutes following the 
completion of the assigned block.  
Following the Block injection (completion of the MRI data May 2023), the subjects will 
be allowed to sit, stand or lay down for the remainder of the study. Continuous 
monitoring and recording of vital signs will take place as, blood pressure and heart rate 
will be measured every 5 minutes, starting prior to performing the block, till 60 minutes 
after the block is performed and every 15 minutes thereafter for the duration of the study. 
A member of the research team blinded to the randomization allocation will perform a 
sensory assessment for loss of sensation to cold using ethanol on the skin at 20, 60, 120, 
240, and 360 mins after the injection of active drug. The extent of sensory loss to cold 
will be marked on the body using a water-soluble color marker each time and will be 
photographed each time interval. A binary scoring system will be used for both 
assessments:  1 = reduced sensation; 2 = normal sensation. 
Once the final sensory assessment has been completed (360 minutes following block), the 
subject will remain for an additional [ADDRESS_350978] them home after 
the procedure.
7.3 Duration of Participation
It will take three days to complete this research study.  For two consecutive days 
following the procedure they will be asked to participate in a follow-up phone call to 
discuss how they are feeling. The script for the follow-up phone call is attached.

heart rate, anxiety, production of abnormally small amounts of urine, reduced sense of touch or 
sensation, chest pain, deficiency of potassium in the bloodstream.
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]: 
• Side effects of epi[INVESTIGATOR_287932]: Fast heartbeat, sweating, headache, weakness, shakiness, 
paleness, and dizziness.
Procedural risks: 
• It will involve the similar procedural risk as other peripheral regional anesthesia procedures. 
This procedure has not been studied very extensively so the literature of its safety is not known 
completely. However, there are a number of case reports and case series that have been 
published in the last year, where ESP has been shown to be safe in different conditions of use.[4-
6] Here at the Penn State Hershey Medical Center, more than two hundred of these blocks have 
been performed for different procedures, without any complications or side effects.
• There is a rare risk of pneumothorax, which is getting air or gas in the cavity between the lungs 
and the chest wall, causing collapse of the lung.
• Venipuncture: Any time we insert a needle in your body there is a minimal risk for bruise, 
infection or extravasation of blood.
MRI removed May [ADDRESS_350988] certain kinds of metal in your body (for example, a heart pacemaker, a 
metal plate, certain types of heart valves or brain aneurysm clips). Someone will ask you questions about 
this before you have the MRI. Having a MRI may mean some added discomfort to you. In particular, 
you may be uncomfortable inside the MRI scanner if you do not like to be in closed spaces 
(“claustrophobia”). You may also be bothered by [CONTACT_287952]. Temporary 
hearing loss has been reported from the loud noise. This is why you will be asked to wear earplugs. 
During the procedure, you will be able to talk with the MRI staff through a speaker system. You can tell 
them to stop the scan at any time.
You should not expect to get your results from the MRI scan since the scan done during this study is not 
designed to detect or evaluate any medical condition you may have. The MRI scan is intended solely for 
research purposes and will not provide the same detailed information as an MRI done for clinical 
reasons. There is a small chance that researchers could find something that might be important to your 
health. If this happens, a member of the study team may contact [CONTACT_287953]. However, even if we find something important to your health, we cannot guarantee that you 
will be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530].

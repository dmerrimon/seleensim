  1 INTRODUCTION  
1.1.  Background  
Depression is the leading cause of disability of mothers worldwide1 with an estimated 10 to 
15% of women in the [LOCATION_003] and Canada experiencing depression during pregnancy or in the year 
following childbirth2,3. Many of these symptoms begin in the antenatal period4, and estimates 
of the lifetime costs of perinatal depression amount to over $45.9 billion dollars (USD) in the 
[LOCATION_003] each year5. Similarly, although given less attention than depression, 15 to 20% of mothers 
experience anxiety symptoms perinatally6, with up to 10% experiencing both7. The negative 
impact of depression and anxiety on the well -being of the mother and her child8-10 underscores 
the importance of addressing perinatal mental health issues.  
Psychological treatments (PTs), including cognitive, behavioral and interpersonal 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], are effective in preventing  and treating perinatal depression and anxiety11,12 and 
preferred by [CONTACT_451795]13,14. Yet, across the US and Canada, as 
few as 20% of women with perinatal depression are treated with evidence -based PTs15. Barriers 
to accessing PTs  in the perinatal period include childcare needs, unpredictable schedules and 
stigma13,16. In addition, a dearth of financial resources and trained professionals may contribute 
to this burden16.  These barriers are problematic given the recent US Preventiv e Task Force 
Recommendations for universal screening of all pregnant and postpartum women for 
depression17 and evidence -based psychological treatments18. Thus, there is an urgent need for 
widely accessible, low -cost, and innovative solutions to improve acc ess to psychological 
treatments for perinatal depression and anxiety.  
1.1.1.  Scalable Innovations    
[IP_ADDRESS].  Non -specialist providers.  Task -sharing has been used worldwide to improve 
access to care, where non -specialist providers (NSPs) —individuals with no formal training in 
delivering mental health care including nurses, peers, lay counselors, midwives, teachers, and 
primary care doctor s—have been trained to effectively treat perinatal depressive and anxiety 
symptoms worldwide19,20. NSPs are an important human -resource because they are widely 
available, affordable, considered trustworthy, and have regular and frequent contacts with 
mothe rs19,21,22. Worldwide, NSPs have successfully implemented behavioural activation (BA) to 
reduce maternal depressive symptoms23,24, anxiety symptoms24, and even intimate partner 
violence among women of childbearing years23. BA can be as effective in targeti ng depression 
as traditional and longer courses of CBT25,26. However, evidence is lacking as to whether 
specialists and NSPs are equally effective in targeting perinatal depressive and anxiety 
symptoms when delivering the same  treatment.   
[IP_ADDRESS].  Teleme dicine.  Telemedicine -based PTs —interventions provided through web -, 
app- and/or telephone -based platforms —offer a promising, alternative approach for mothers in 
terms of flexibility27, efficiency28, and costs29—thus increasing accessibility and scalability  of 
PTs. Recent reviews show that effects on depressive and anxiety symptoms are similar when 
comparing digital and in -person services30.  Access to PTs nonetheless remains limited15,31. 
11 
 
SUMMIT Protocol V20: [ADDRESS_575980] 2024    
   
  1.1.2.  Why Behavioural Activation?  
BA proposes that the key to feeling less depressed and anxious is to increase enjoyable or 
fulfilling activities that align with one’s values32,33, targeting the mechanisms of patient 
activation and avoidant copi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. We will be using a brief, 6 -8 session version of BA that was 
shown t o be effective in reducing depressive symptoms and enhancing rates of remission when 
delivered by [CONTACT_451796], with sustained effects in Goa, India (led by [CONTACT_3252] -I Patel and involved the 
PI)23,34. Among effective treatments for depression,  BA is an excellent candida te for this study 
for three reasons:  
1. BA has a strong evidence base  for effectiveness in the general health care population35,36. In 
a randomized placebo controlled study in the US, BA was as efficacious as, and more 
enduring than, antidepressant medication  (ADM), with fewer patients droppi[INVESTIGATOR_451779]25,26; in the [LOCATION_006], BA was as effective as longer courses of CBT26,37.  
2. BA is effective in treating perinatal depression . In randomized trials in the US, BA was 
associated with high satisfaction and treatment engagement22,[ADDRESS_575981] 
demonstrated that lay counselors, undergraduate psychology students, peers and midwives 
can all be trained to effectively deliver BA or components to reduce depressive sympto ms.   
1.2. Rationale  
Our overarching goal of SUMMIT ( Scaling Up Maternal Mental healthcare by [CONTACT_451797]) is to examine the scalability and patient -centered provision of brief, evidence -
based PTs for perinatal depression and anxiety. Specifically, the current proposal will answer 
the question of the effectiveness of the integration of telemedicine of  PTs within larger health 
systems, and whether frontline non -mental health workers, with appropriate training, can 
effectively deliver BA for perinatal depressive and anxiety symptoms. We will identify relevant 
underlying implementation processes and deter mine whether, and to what extent, these 
strategies work differentially for certain women over others.  Addressing these aims can 
support a stepped care model in which we optimize the use of available resources. In doing so, 
this research has the potential to increase the accessibility, scalability, and cost -effectiveness of 
evidence -base of PTs for perinatal women worldwide.  
1.3 Potential Risk and Benefits  
1.3.1. Potential Risks  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Inconvenience.  Participants may feel inconvenienced by [CONTACT_451798]. The expected time commitment will be explicitly stated in the consent 
form.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Psychological risks associated with assessment.  There is the possibility that 
participants could be upset or offended by [CONTACT_451799] . In order to minimize psychological 
12 
 
SUMMIT Protocol V20: [ADDRESS_575982] 2024    
   
  harm, information about potential risks is included in the consent form. Participants also will be 
instructed that they are free to not answer any questions they choose on the surveys.   
[IP_ADDRESS]. Psychological risks ass ociated with treatment or training.   
[IP_ADDRESS].1. Participants.  As in any study related to mental health concerns, discussion of 
symptoms may cause psychological discomfort and participants may also experience 
exacerbation of depressive or anxiety symptoms. Established safety protocols will be 
implemented to offset these risks ( Appendix A – Safety Protocols and Forms ).  Furthermore, the 
recent [LOCATION_002] Preventive Task Force guidelines have suggested that there is no -to-
minimal harm of evidence -based PTs including cognitive, behavioral and interpersonal 
psychotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]18. 
[IP_ADDRESS].2. Providers.  It also is possible that a potential treatment provider may be upset 
if they are withdrawn from the study for not meeting competency standards. We will provide 
clear  orientation as part of the training process, and will make referrals for anyone who is 
overly bothered by [CONTACT_451800]. In addition, NSPs may become stressed 
while participating as providers. Treatment Providers will receive information and techniques in 
self-care as part of the BA training curriculum and established safety protocols will be 
implemented to offset these risks ( see Treatment Provider/Research Assistant Safety, Appendix 
A – Safety Protocols and Forms, pg 5).  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Physic al Harm.  We do not anticipate any physical risks for participants or 
treatment providers. Participants’ physical care needs will remain in the hands of their primary 
care physicians or OB provider during the study. We will ask participants to provide conta ct 
information and a release of information for their provider in order to communicate any 
physical health concerns during the study involvement should the need arise. We will also ask 
participants for secondary personal contacts ( see Secondary Contact [INVESTIGATOR_108052] m, Appendix E – Study 
Documents, pg 83).  
1.3.2 Potential Benefits  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Participants.  This study may provide participants with insight into their mental 
health states and equip them with strategies to overcome their depressive and anxiety 
symptoms. Ove r the course of the treatment, participants may experience an increase in 
knowledge of mental health symptoms and increase their copi[INVESTIGATOR_451780]. In light of 
COVID -19, this study is considered ‘essential research’ by [CONTACT_451801] a 
valuable, evidence -based psychotherapy to study participants.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Providers.  NSPs may receive the benefit of personal satisfaction from making a 
positive impact on perinatal women struggling with these issues.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Society.  Preventing a nd decreasing the severity of perinatal mental health 
issues offers significant benefits to society, given that depression is a leading cause of disability 
worldwide with serious consequences for offspring. These benefits would be particularly 
marked if th e BA treatment provided by [CONTACT_451802] -person.  
13 
 
SUMMIT Protocol V20: [ADDRESS_575983] -delivered treatment, as 
measured by [CONTACT_283718] (EPDS)41.  
2. To examine if a brief BA psychological treatment delivered through telemedicine is as 
effective in trea ting perinatal depressive symptoms as in -person treatment, as measured by 
[CONTACT_451803]41.  
 
The assessment period will be extended for those women who encounter a hiatus in treatment 
due to significant perinatal -related life events (e.g., giving birth, obstetrical complications, 
COVID -19). 
1.4.2. Secondary Objectives  
1. To examine the aforementioned questions among anxiety symptoms, as measured by [CONTACT_117670] -742,43.  
2. To assess moderating effects as to whether clinical severity (mild, moderate and severe) 
and t he timing of the treatment (antenatal vs. postnatal) differentially influences depressive 
symptoms and whether timing of treatment influences child mental development at [ADDRESS_575984] a process evaluation; i.e., identify the un derlying processes related to delivery 
and scalability of a brief PT for perinatal depressive and anxiety symptoms from a multi -
stakeholder perspective including relevant barriers and facilitators.  
4. To conduct an economic evaluation to examine the cost -effectiveness of NSP -delivered and 
telemedicine psychotherapy compared to specialist and in -person psychotherapy.  
1.5.  Hypotheses  
1. We hypothesize that among mothers with depressive symptoms, i) telemed icine -PT will be 
as effective as in -person treatment; and ii) NSP -delivered PT will be as effective as 
specialist -delivered PT at [ADDRESS_575985] the choice of delivery mode and 
provider, implementing a brief evidence -based PT of BA for perinatal depressive and anxiety 
symptoms, and to determine the un derlying processes related to delivery and scalability of the 
PT from a multi -stakeholder prospective.

  2 METHODS – Participants, Interventions and Outcomes  
 
2.1.  Participants and Setting.   
N=1230 pregnant and postpartum women, aged ≥18, will be recruited  from three study centers 
though their networks of clinics. Participants will be drawn from diverse and representative 
populations in Toronto, Chapel Hill, and Chicago.  The flow chart (Figure 1) shows the process of 
recruitment and follow -up of participan ts in each hub. In Toronto, we will recruit from Sinai 
Health (SH), Women’s College Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (WCH) and St. Michael’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (SMH) —three major 
academic hospi[INVESTIGATOR_451781] , and our external 
referral networks . In North Carolina, we will recruit from three clinical sites affiliated with the 
University of North Carolina (UNC) Women’s and Neuroscience Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600].  In Chicago, we will 
recruit from fourteen affiliated obstetric and family medicine clinics.  Our traine d research 
assistants will approach all attending women or contact [CONTACT_451804] a screening.  At one site 
(WCH), permission will first be required by a member of the participant’s circle of care, will 
introduce the study and ask if she is interested in le arning more.  If the participant agrees, the 
trained research assistant will approach the participant in person or via phone for screen. 
Recruitment personnel will use established safety protocols ( Appendix A - Safety Protocols and 
Forms ). Inclusion and ex clusion criteria are detailed in Table 5. Screening will take place in -
person or over the phone, as determined by [CONTACT_451805].  
Table 5. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria  
INCLUSION  EXCLUSION  
● EPDS≥10  
● ≥18 years  
● Pregnant up to 36 weeks or 4 to 30 weeks postpartum  
● Speaks English or (US sites) Spanish  ● Active suicidal intent (ideation and plan), active symptoms 
of psychosis or mania  
● Psychotropic medication dose or medication change within 
two weeks of enrollment or beginning treatment  
● Ongoing psycho therapy (no more than once every 8 weeks 
or during the duration of the intervention)  
● Active substance abuse or dependence  
● Severe fetal anomalies, stillbirth or infant death at time of 
enrollment for index pregnancy  
● Non -English, non -Spanish speakers  
Following informed consent, potential participants will be screened for eligibility using a list of 
previously -used and validated measures. Our screening measures are briefly described below 
and can be found in SUMMIT Screening Measures, Appendix C – Study  Measures , pg 4.  
● Active suicidal intent will be assessed using the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale44. 
This is the most commonly used scale to assess suicide risk and has been used extensively 
with adult populations and by [CONTACT_451806]45.  
● Active symptoms of psychosis will be assessed using two screening questions: "Do you hear 
things that others can't or don't hear ?" and "Have you ever felt that someone was playing 
with your mind?" The measure was validated against  clinician ratings of psychosis, and 
performed with strong psychometric properties including a sensitivity of 53% and specificity 
of 98% for clinically significant hallucinations or delusions, and sensitivity of 32% and 
specificity of 99% for identifying p eople in an early phase of psychosis (clinical high risk or 
15 
 
SUMMIT Protocol V20: [ADDRESS_575987] epi[INVESTIGATOR_16743]).  To reduce false positives, these two stem questions have been 
further adapted for the purposes of this study and perinatal population to be supplemented 
with probes from  the frequently used Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview 
(MINI)46.  
● Mania will be assessed using a one -item question that asks “In the last two weeks, have you 
had periods of feeling so happy or energetic that you did not need to sleep or behaved  in 
ways that were unusual for you and did this worry your friends and family?”. This question 
has been used extensively by [CONTACT_451807]47.  
● Alcohol use will be assessed using the Alcohol Use and Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT ) 
has been used extensively worldwide to screen for alcohol use and dependence48. Its 
psychometric properties are well -validated49 and patient -centered in its brevity.   
● Three questions, borrowed from the psychometrically -robust DAST Drug Use 
Questionnaire50, will assess participants’ reported drug use to determine whether 
participants engage in drug use and the extent to which it influences their lives. We selected 
three key questions as individuals have found that even single -item questionnaires are valid 
to assess drug use in primary care 51. These three questions are:   
a. Do you currently use drugs other than those required for medical reasons? [Probe: 
[if NO] What about marijuana?]  
b. Does it negatively impact your life?  
c. Does your spouse (or parents) ever complain about your involvement with drugs?  
● Finally, severe fetal anomaly, stillbirth or infant death will be determined by [CONTACT_451808]-report and/or verified with a chart review. Language aptitude in English or Spanish 
will be determined when the pot ential participant is approached.

  Figure 1: Study Flow Chart  
 
Figure [ADDRESS_575989] of six to eight weekly sessions of BA delivered to 
each participant individually.  The current manual ( Appendices B1 and B2 – Treatment Manual 
and The PREMIUM Counselling for Relationships Manual, respectively) ) have been adapted from 
two well -established and tested manuals — the Alma Program for perinatal populations in 
Colorado and the Healthy Acti vity Program (HAP) from Goa, India, respectively. BA posits that 
the key to feeling less depressed is to increase enjoyable or fulfilling activities that align with 
one’s values32,33 and targeting the mechanisms of patient activation. Unlike other cognitiv e 
behavioral interventions for depression, BA explicitly targets avoidant copi[INVESTIGATOR_007], treating it much 
like any other anxiety disorder. This should facilitate our secondary focus on anxiety. Key 
strategies include: psychoeducation, behavioral assessment, activ ity monitoring and 
structuring, activation of social networks, interpersonal effectiveness, and problem solving.  
 
2.2.2. Treatment indicators.   Compliance  is defined as attending a minimum of six sessions 
(reduced if patient has two consistent sessions of  EPDS session -wise scores<10) over a period of 
four months unless a pregnancy - or COVID -related hiatus is experienced. Reasons for dropout 
will be recorded in the individual patient’s treatment log ( see SUMMIT Treatment Log Record 
Form, Appendix C – Study Measures, pg 40) using a data capture and storage system called the 
Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCapTM). Response  and remission  will be defined as PHQ -
[ADDRESS_575990] -randomization. This period will  
be extended in the event that there is a hiatus to treatment due to significant perinatal -related 
life events (e.g., giving birth, obstetrical complications, COVID -19). Another indicator will 
include the estimation of comorbidity on both the EPDS and GAD -7.  
 
2.2.3. Intervention Arms.  During regular operations participants will be randomized to one of 
four arms (Figure 2):  
 
Figure 2. Intervention Arms  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Telemedicine vs. In -Person.  Telemedicine will be implemented via the Ontario 
Telemedicine Network and ZoomTM in Toronto, via the UNC TelePsychiatry Program in Chapel 
Hill, and via ZoomTM in Chicago. All offer secure personal videoconferencing service, are free to 

17 
 
SUMMIT Protocol V20: [ADDRESS_575991] 2024    
   
  registered healthca re providers (including nurses), and PHIPA/HIPAA compliant. They also 
permit video -visits and scheduling and are accessible on PC, Mac, Android and iOS systems. For 
participants who do not have access to a phone, tablet, or computer, or whose device 
malfun ctions, study tablets will be available and enabled for use on a temporary basis. 
Instructions for use will be provided. During telemedicine sessions, established safety protocols 
will be implemented (see Appendix A – Safety Protocols and Forms ). Participa nts assigned to 
Telemedicine can do their BA sessions in whatever private location they prefer (e.g., home or 
elsewhere). In -person sessions will be held at participating clinical care sites within UToronto, 
UNC and NorthShore Chicago.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Non -Special ists vs. Specialists.  SUMMIT treatment providers will include both 
non-specialist providers (NSPs) and specialists. NSPs will be healthcare workers with general 
health care professional skills (as assessed during recruitment) but without formal training in  
mental health care or experience delivering PTs. Specialists will include individuals with formal 
training in mental health care delivery (e.g., psychiatrists, psychologists and social workers) with 
experience in treating perinatal mental illness and a mi nimum of 5 years of experience 
delivering psychological treatments.  To ensure consistency across hubs, a minimum of two 
clinical leads (i.e., expert Co -I’s designated to oversee the training and clinical implementation 
of the BA treatment), one from the l ocal hub and one from another hub, will conduct training.  
The original study design included a 4 -arm, 1:1:1:1 randomization strategy (Phase 1, see 
Figure 3 below) which was modified to a 2 -arm, 1:1 (telemedicine only; Phase 2) strategy at the 
start of the  COVID -19 pandemic. Following vaccine rollout and the subsequent decrease in 
COVID -19 cases, we transitioned to a weighted 4 -arm, 3:1 (in -person:telemedicine; Phase 3) 
strategy in an effort to equalize the number of randomized in -person to telemedicine cas es. 
However, in light of the frequently changing COVID -19 situation, we will transition to an 
adaptive study design (Phase 4) in which we move between a balanced 4 -arm randomization 
strategy (1:1:1:1; similar to Phase 1) and a 2 -arm (telemedicine only; sim ilar to Phase 2) 
randomization strategy (1:1) (Figure 3) based on COVID -related institutional restrictions that 
impact in -person care and recommendations at each site. This protocol modification will allow 
us to continually adapt to the rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375] -changing CO VID-19 situation and reflects the pragmatic 
and patient -centered nature of this study. Participants will be informed about these ratios in 
the consent forms (see Informed Consent Form – 2 Arm, Appendix E – Study Documents , pg 4  
and Informed Consent Form – 4 Arm, Appendix E – Study Documents, pg 16) . The study design 
and relevant statistics have been reviewed by [CONTACT_3476], biostatistician and independent 
board of trial advisors.

2.3 Non -Specialists: Recruitm ent, Training, Supervision and Selection  
2.3.1 Recruitment.  Recruitment of NSPs will be based on the aforementioned 
inclusion/exclusion criteria as well an expressed desire to help women with depressive and 
anxiety symptoms. During recruitment, a selection interview will take place, whereby [CONTACT_451809] —the style with which they interact with a mock 
patient —using the Therapy Quality Scale52.  We have used this method previously and found 
that it correlates with trainee competency. Trainee providers will be recruited by [CONTACT_451810], and selected based on their 
performance in a structured interview and role -play during an intake interview. The same 
procedures will be implemented in each hub.   
 2.3.2. Training & Competency Tests.  In Fall 2019, those trainees selected will be invited 
to participate in a 5 -day participatory training workshop covering the manualized BA treatment 
for perinatal mental health populations ( Appendix B1 – Treatment Manual ) and an adapted 
version of The PREMIUM Counselling for Relationships Manual23 (Appendix B2 – The PREMIUM 
Counselling for Relationships Manual ). Trainees who meet competency standards (based on a 
multiple -choice questionnaire used for another BA trial; see Competency Measure Survey, 
Appendix C – Study Measures, pg 49) and in an interaction with a standardized patient (actor) 
rated by [CONTACT_451811] Q -HAP52 (see Quality of Healthy Activity 
Program (Q -HAP), Appendix C – Study Measures , pg 45) will be selected for the 8 -week  
internship phase of the trial. During the internship phase, trainees will see up to 2 participants 
(one via telemedicine and one in -person) to implement the BA treatment. In addition, all 
trainees will receive training in the safety protocols ( see Appendi x A). 
2.3.3. Supervision.  The trainees will receive weekly group supervision from the hub 
intervention lead (see Table 1 above). All intervention leads are co -I’s on the current study, with 
a minimum of 10 years’ experience training and supervising lay and  specialist therapi[INVESTIGATOR_451782] 

19 
 
SUMMIT Protocol V20: [ADDRESS_575993] 2024    
   
  supervision to NSPs. Therapy quality will be assessed using a reliable and validated tool (an 
adapted version of the Q -HAP52; see Quality of H ealthy Activity Program (Q -HAP), Appendix C – 
Study Measures , pg 45). As the trainee counsellors gain experience in delivering the 
intervention, the supervision format will evolve from expert led (that is, the clinical lead and 
specialist who is skilled in  the delivery of the PT) to peer -led group supervision. All treatment 
providers will record all BA sessions for training and supervision purposes and for fidelity 
measures.  
 2.3.4. Selection.  Only trainees who achieve competence, as assessed by [CONTACT_451812] d 
role-plays and therapy quality assessments, will be selected to deliver BA during the trial.    
 
2.4 Specialists.  Specialists will include a wide range of specialties (e.g., psychiatrists, clinical and 
counseling psychologists, social workers) with a min imum of [ADDRESS_575994] 
session with each participant during the internship phase ( see SUMMIT Perceived Telemedicine 
Platform Proficiency Self -Assessment Questionnaire (for providers), Appendix C – Study 
Measures , pg 105).  Participants assigned to the given provider will also be asked to rate their 
provider’s telemedicine proficiency after their last session ( see SUMMIT Perceived Telemedicine 
Platform Proficiency Self -Assessment Questionnaire (for  participants), Appendix C – Study 
Measures , pg 105). The questionnaire is a brief, 5 -item scale rated from 0 (Strongly Disagree) to 
4 (Strongly Agree).

SUMMIT Protocol V20: [ADDRESS_576003] been previously used and valida ted in one or more of 
the investigators’ trials targeting perinatal mental health23,24,34,40,53,54,60,67,[ADDRESS_576004]. Our emphasis on mothers’ self -reported data adheres to 
PCORI’s methodology standards that emphasize that the patient population is the best source of 
information.  
    
2.6. Sample Size   
The primary outcome measure will be participant’s EPDS mean score at 3 months after 
randomization; the assessment period will be extended in the event that there is a hiatus to 
treatment due to significant perinatal -related life events (e.g., giving birth, ob stetrical 
complications, COVID -19) or to one week after the last session if participants complete 
treatment after the [ADDRESS_576005] randomization period.  The study is designed to be a non -
inferiority trial with four arms: telemedicine specialist, telemedic ine non -specialist, in -person 
specialist, in -person non -specialist. The two primary hypotheses are that telemedicine will be 
non-inferior to in -person, and that non -specialist delivery agents will be non -inferior to 
specialist delivery agents. The sample s ize calculation is based on an EPDS mean estimate of 
7.93 (SD=4.6853). Using a non -inferiority margin of 10% (i.e., EPDS score of 0.79) in relation to 
the mean), and an alpha=0. [ADDRESS_576006] comparison (NSP vs. SP) we require 431 participants 
in each of  the two groups to provide greater than 80% power. To account for 10% drop out, the 
sample size is inflated to N=958  (479 per group, NSP vs. SP). Using a non -inferiority margin of 
13% (i.e., EPDS score of 1.03 in relation to the mean), and an alpha=0.05  for our second 
comparison (TM vs. IP) , we require an additional 268 IP participants . When combined with the 
958 TM participants, this yields a total study sample size of N=1,226 which accounts for 10% 
loss to follow -up. Previous randomized non -inferiority  trials37 have demonstrated that a 14% 
non-inferiority margin can be considered clinically meaningful.   
We are planning a final sample size of N=1 ,230, four more participants than the power 
calculation requires. The reason for this n=[ADDRESS_576007] that we do not receive each site’s recruitment numbers until the end of each day. These 
statistics have been reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_451813].   
 
2.7.  Screening, Recruitment, and Consent  
2.7.1. Quan titative Data.  Across the three hubs, we anticipate assessing 18,280 participants for 
potential eligibility, obtaining informed consent to screen 9,140, and recruit and retain a 
sample size of N=1, 230 women (see Figure 1).  We anticipate that 50% of participants will be 
recruited in Toronto, and 25% each in Chapel Hill and Chicago, respectively. Participants will be 
recruited from all study sites though their networks of in -patient obstetrical units, f amily 
practice, obstetrical and mental health clinics, and community partners  (see Recruitment Poster 
– 4 Arm Without Tabs, Appendix E – Study Documents, pg 123 ). Referrals will also be elicited 
from clinicians from site hospi[INVESTIGATOR_451785] .  Relevant stakeholder groups, such as Life with a Baby, will also be 
provided with information about the trial  to share with their members .  Interested individuals 
can contact [CONTACT_451814] r more information .   
To help alleviate the mental health burden that COVID -19 imposes on our health care 
systems, physicians not affiliated with a study site will be able to refer their patients to the 
23 
 
SUMMIT Protocol V20: [ADDRESS_576008] 2024    
   
  SUMMIT Trial for screening and enrollment, if eligibl e and willing. This includes referrals from 
physicians not affiliated with the trial (external referrals) and referrals between recruitment 
sites (internal referrals). Internal referrals will occur among patients who express interest in 
participating in th e trial at a study site where recruitment is on temporary hold due to 
treatment provider capacity.  
1. External referrals: Study Investigators will notify their physician colleagues not 
affiliated with a study site that the SUMMIT Trial is open to their patients ( see  Email 
for External Physicians, Appendix E – Study Documents, pg 126 and 129 ) and provide 
a description of the study ( Information for External Physicians, Appendix E – Study 
Documents, pg 125 and 128) .  Physicians will briefly describe the st udy to their 
patients, and ask them if they are interested in learning more.  If the patient is 
interested, the physician will then request their patients’ permission to send their 
name [CONTACT_3669] [CONTACT_114369].  Potential participants may  also 
learn of  the trial through relevant stakeholder groups in which they are members 
(for example, Life with a Baby) .  Interested individuals will be able to contact [CONTACT_451815].  
2. Internal referrals:  Patients who express interest in par ticipating in the trial at a study 
site may not be able to immediately access treatment if randomization is 
temporarily paused due to reaching treatment provider capacity.  In this event, 
patients will be given the option of a referral to the trial at a di fferent site that is still 
able to accept new participants.  If they agree, the study team at the referring site 
will request the patient’s permission to send their contact [CONTACT_451816].  Contact [CONTACT_451817] d or encrypted and sent via 
secure hospi[INVESTIGATOR_451786] a secure hospi[INVESTIGATOR_451787]. No identifying 
information will be included in the title or body of the email.  Participation in the 
trial at the second site will not affect the patient’s car e at the referring site.  Upon 
receipt of the contact [CONTACT_3031], the study team at the second site will contact [CONTACT_451818].  
Women will be contact[CONTACT_451819] a trained research assistant, a tr eating physician or 
another member of the circle of care to ask whether they can be contact[CONTACT_451820]. They will then receive a brief overview of the study by a research 
assistant, while an in -patient, visiting an out -patient clinic, or over the phone. Women who 
agree will then be fully informed of the study procedures by [CONTACT_17033], and given 
an informed consent form ( see Informed Consent Form, Appendix E – Study Documents,  pg 4 
and 16) to review.  Women will b e given as much time as they need to decide whether they 
wish to participate, and the research assistant will answer all questions they may have.  Once 
they sign the consent form, women will be screened using the Edinburgh Postnatal Scale for 
Depression (E PDS≥1041) and General Anxiety Disorder (GAD) -[ADDRESS_576009] 7 days is in the patient’s clinical chart, we will use and enter that score 
for screening instead of asking the patient to complete the scale again.  In the interest of 
patient -centered care, women who give their permission may also complete informed consent

SUMMIT Protocol V20: [ADDRESS_576010] -party (a second 
study team member), and will then be emailed links to screening measures.  These women will 
be provided with a self -addressed, stamped envelope to mail their signed consent forms back 
to the site, and will then be sent a consent form with their own signature [CONTACT_451864].   
To reflect the pragmati c and patient -centered nature of the trial and in an effort to 
uphold recommended social distancing guidelines for both participants and research staff, we 
will not ask participants to mail back signed consent forms during COVID -[ADDRESS_576011] party will add their names and signatures to 
the form to indicate that they explained the study and confirmed consent. Participants will not 
enter their names in REDCapTM during this process.  Consent forms will only be identified by 
[CONTACT_451821] l inked to participant profiles in REDCapTM, respectively.  
At the American sites, research assistants will either be bilingual or use a translation 
service so that they can explain the study to potential participants who only speak Spanish and 
a consent for m will be provided in that language. All study questionnaires and the BA 
intervention will be conducted in Spanish for Spanish -speaking participants. Recruitment rates 
will be closely monitored.  Self -referrals will also be accepted if recruitment rates ar e low. 
Brochures outlining the study’s aims, potential impact and inclusion/exclusion criteria will be 
provided to all recruitment sites ( see Brochure, Appendix E – Study Documents , pg 115 and 
117).Trained research assistants will follow -up with each appro priate referral and obtain 
informed consent (Figure 3).  Recruitment will begin in January 2020 and continue until March 
2023 (39 months in total) at all sites.

2.7.2. Qualitative Interviews.  A team of trained interviewers will collect qualitative data 
through semi -structured, in -depth interviews and focus group discussions. These individuals will 
be independent from both the recruitment and data teams. Topic guides were developed and 
reviewed  with a range of key stakeholders to ensure questions are relevant and acceptable.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Qualitative Phase 1  (Sep 2019 to Apr 2020) . All NSPs, specialist providers, and 
supervisors will take part in qualitative semi -structured interviews to explore their work 
experience related to training and supervision.  All potential treatment providers will be 
informed that they will be required to complete interviews when they are recruited. All 
successful applicants who accept the positions as providers or sup ervisors will understand that 
in accepting the position, they will participate in semi -structured interviews that will be used in 
the research study as a part of their job.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Qualitative Phase 2 (May 2020 to Mar 2024).  A subset of study participan ts, 
significant others, treatment providers  and supervisors, and a wide range of stakeholders 
(patient advocates, health professionals, and policy makers) will be invited to participate in 
qualitative, semi -structured interviews to examine key aspects of t he intervention, including 
content, delivery and modality, enactment of key messages, scalability, and, where applicable, 
supervision procedures.  In the first six months of this process, we will also ask several semi -
structured questions to examine whethe r aspects of the treatment content or delivery were 
modified in light of COVID -19.  
Participants.  – We will conduct the qualitative interviews with representative subsets of 
perinatal participants  (n=300) across the four arms , selected to represent different variables 
such as symptom severity, perinatal period (antenatal and postnatal), sociodemographic 

26 
 
SUMMIT Protocol V20: [ADDRESS_576013] 2024    
   
  variables, and treatment completion status (completers and non -completers). Potential 
participants will be identified by [CONTACT_451822] a research assistant if 
they would consider taking part in the interviews. A research assistant will approach those 
willing to explain the interview process and secure informed consent ( see Informed Consent 
Form – Participant Qualitative, Appendix E  – Study Documents,  pg 37).  The research assistant 
will answer any questions and the women will be given as much time as they need to make an 
informed decision. Please note that this research assistant is independent and has not 
conducted any baseline or follow -up assessments with potential participants.  
Significant Others.  – Up to [ADDRESS_576014] their partner and explain 
the interview process and secure informed consent ( see Informed Consent Form – Partners 
Qualitative, Appendix E – Study Documents, pg 46) to review. The research assistant will answer 
any questions the partners may have via whatever means of communication they prefer (e.g., 
phone or email), and th e partners will be given as much time as they need to make an informed 
decision.  
Treatment Providers and Clinical Leads.  – All NSPs, specialist providers and clinical leads 
will be expected to participate in the  Qualitative  Phase 2 interviews as a part of their job 
description.  Treatment providers and clinical leads were previously asked to provide informed 
consent to participate in up to three interviews and then will be given a consent  addendum  
form to agree to participat e in an additional five interviews  for a total of eight interviews .   
Other Stakeholders.  – Other stakeholders include relevant health professionals (e.g., 
nurses, midwives and physicians from mental health, obstetrics and family medicine), patients 
and pa tient advocates, telemedicine and insurance experts, study staff, and policy makers 
identified by [CONTACT_451823]. Stakeholders are informed that qualitative interviews about thei r views and 
experiences are a voluntary part of the study and that they will be sent invitations to 
participate.  The research assistant will send a link to the informed consent in REDCapTM by 
[CONTACT_6968] ( see Informed Consent Form – Stakeholders Qualitative, Ap pendix E – Study Documents,  
pg 55, Informed Consent Form – Staff Qualitative, Appendix E – Study Documents,  pg 62 
,SUMMIT Stakeholder Email Interview Invite – Appendix E – Study Documents,  pg 61 and 
SUMMIT Staff Email Interview Invite – Appendix E – Study Documents,  pg 68).  The stakeholders 
will be able to ask the research assistant any questions they may have by [CONTACT_61529], and 
the stakeholder will be given as much time as they need to make an informed decision.  The RA 
will follow up with stakeholders who do not respond to the email to check if they have any 
questions and if they are interested in participating.

  2.8.  Randomization  
All participants will be stratified by [CONTACT_451824] (antenatal vs. postnatal) and then 
randomized within site to one of the f our arms, unless restricted to two arms due to COVID -
related institutional restrictions of in -person care (see section [IP_ADDRESS]) and using a web -based 
randomization service as part of REDCap™. Randomization will occur only after informed 
consent has been ob tained and all baseline measures have been completed and all 
inclusion/exclusion criteria verified with the participant. We will enroll equal numbers in each 
of the four intervention arms. This strategy allows sufficient power to determine whether NSPs 
are no less efficacious than specialists and telemedicine is no less efficacious than in -person 
treatment, respectively, in settings that collectively assure ethnic and racial diversity, as well as 
potential heterogeneity in age, variability in symptom severi ty as well as access to resources.  
 
2.9. Blinding and Masking   
If eligible, baseline assessments will be carried out on site at time of recruitment or at home, as 
per the participant’s preference. The baseline assessment will be accessed by a secure link sent 
via REDCapTM, which participants will be asked to complete before their first treatment session. 
Once baseline is completed, the participants will be randomized.  The outcome assessments at 
3, 6, [ADDRESS_576016] -randomization will also be completed by [CONTACT_451825]™. 
Participants and providers will not be blind to treatment allocation; however, both will be told 
that we are evaluating the same intervention and there is clinical equipoise about whether one 
is better than the other. Outcome measu res for participants will be administered through 
REDCap™. Trained research assistants independent of the treatment delivery and blind to 
allocation status will conduct the participant interviews and child assessments . 
 
2.10. Economic Evaluation  
We will evaluate the cost -effectiveness of non -specialist providers and telemedicine, compared 
to specialist providers and in -person sessions. We will undertake a cost -utility analysis 
conducted at the [ADDRESS_576017] -randomization follow -up point. The prima ry outcome will be 
quality -adjusted life years (QALYs) calculated using the EuroQol 5 Dimension 5 Level (EQ -5D-5L) 
measure of health -related quality of life, collected at 3, 6 and 12 -months.  
2.10.1. Economic -related data.  The primary outcome related to the  economic evaluation is 
quality adjusted life years (QALYs) calculated using the  EuroQol 5 Dimension 5 Level (EQ -5D-5L) measure 
of health -related quality of life58. An advantage of the EQ -5D-5L is that an overall utility score of health -
related quality of life can be obtained, which facilitates comparisons with other interventions and health 
states in other illnesses.  
2.10.2. Service use.  The use of all health services, other than the intervention (BA), are being 
recorded using an adapted version of the he alth services utilization questionnaire (HSUQ)63. Data on the 
use of BA (number and duration of therapy contacts and with whom) will be collected from existing 
clinical records. This measure ( see Health Service Utilization Questionnaire, Appendix C – Study  
Measures, pg. 35)  was adapted with reference to other measures used in perinatal depression 
populations69 and for use in Canadian and US contexts with input from service users and clinicians. It will 
be completed at baseline (covering the last 3 months) and each follow -up interview (covering the period 
since the last interview). The HSUQ records use of health  services, specifically: hospi[INVESTIGATOR_278904], 
28 
 
SUMMIT Protocol V20: [ADDRESS_576018] micro -costing 
approach70. Unit costs for BA will include all employer costs and appropriate overheads (capi[INVESTIGATOR_307], 
managerial, administrative etc.; see List of Costs, Appendix C – Study Measures, pg. 108). The cost of 
supervision will be included and the time each therapi[INVESTIGATOR_451788] -related activities (non -participant contact [CONTACT_451826], for example, training, 
administration, meetings with other professionals etc.) will be estimated using a questionnaire. Data on 
the use of all oth er health services will be costed for each individual participant over the course of the 
trial. Unit costs in both Canada and the [LOCATION_003] will be obtained from Canadian guidelines on person -level 
costing71 and local Medicaid, Medicare, and private insurer fee schedules commonly available in the 
US72, respectively.  
3 METHODS – Data Collection, Management & Analysis  
 
3.1.  Data Collection  
Two types of data will be collected .  
3.1.1.  Quantitative Data.  All variables will be recorded into the web -based data management 
software REDCapTM.  All variables, with the exception of those recorded in the treatment log 
collected by [CONTACT_451827] ( see SUMMIT Treatment Log Record Form, Appendix C – 
Study M easures, pg 40) and childbirth outcomes, will be automated for collection via REDCapTM. 
Children will be assessed in -home at [ADDRESS_576019] -birth (Figure 1; Table 6) with data 
recorded in REDCapTM.  
 
3.1.2.  Qualitative Data.  An independent team of train ed interviewers will collect qualitative 
data through audio -recorded, semi -structured, in -depth interviews and focus group discussions.  
Interviews will examine key aspects of the intervention including intervention content, delivery, 
and enactment. Interv iew guides were developed and reviewed with specific advisory 
committees including mothers and clinicians will be used. A maximum variance, purposive, and 
snowball sampling approach will be used, when applicable, to adequately capture participants 
across s everity levels, perinatal periods, sites, key sociodemographic factors and stakeholder 
groups.   
[IP_ADDRESS]. Qualitative Phase 1.  We will explore experiences related to training by 
[CONTACT_451828], special ists and 
supervisors. All providers and supervisors will be interviewed by [CONTACT_451829]. Individuals will be interviewed at the end of training that will take place in Fall 2019 
and before the trial, and interviews with newly on -boarded providers will be conducted on an 
ongoing basis.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Qualitative Phase 2.  We will assess the relevant barriers and facilitators of the 
intervention delivery and implementation with a subset of participants from the existing trial 
and with multi ple stakeholders approached to participate in semi -structured interviews.  We 
will conduct interviews with various subsets of n=[ADDRESS_576020] been 
enrolled in the study, including representation from each of the four arms, treatme nt 
completers vs non -completers, and antenatal vs postnatal enrollment. An unblinded data 
29 
 
SUMMIT Protocol V20: [ADDRESS_576021] 2024    
   
  manager will identify potential participants. In addition, we will interview up to n=6      0 
significant others (including spouses or partners of participating peri natal participants), all 
specialist and non -specialist providers, and  n=160 health professionals and relevant 
stakeholders such as patient advocates. A maximum variance, purposive, or snowball sample 
will be used, when applicable, to adequately capture p articipants across severity levels, 
perinatal periods, sites key sociodemographic factors and stakeholder groups. Each type of 
group will consent to being  interviewed three times, except for treatment providers who may 
be interviewed up to eight times ( see Treatment Provider Qualitative Addenda, Appendix E – pg. 
37 – 40), and interviews will be conducted during all  phases of the trial (beginning, middle, and 
end) to ensure that we are capturing relevant aspects of the interventions while it is being 
implemented. In addition, we will interview all treatment providers and clinical leads again to 
assess their perspectives over a later part of the trial and in the event that there are new 
providers trained. Finally, we will examine the data to see whether th ere were specific barriers, 
facilitators and modifications made to the content and delivery of the BA treatment in light of 
COVID -19.  
3.2.  Drop Out and Follow -Up Strategies  
We expect 20% of participants to be lost to follow -up. This dropout rate is conservative and has 
been found in many similar trials using NSPs and specialist delivered PTs for perinatal depression 
in the US and Canada24,39,53,54. Based on a Cochrane review73, numerous research on study 
retention (e.g.,74-76), and our previous exper iences34,40,53,54, it is realistic to expect a [ADDRESS_576022] 80% when we incorporate the following strategies:  
(1) Participant Strategies : We will complete qualitative interviews at the participant’s pace, 
allow flexib ility with the interviews, design information material at a low reading level, and 
provide realistic expectations regarding study involvement. We will send quarterly 
newsletters to study participants with information that might be of interest or that 
parti cipants may find useful, and reminders about questionnaire timelines ( see SUMMIT 
Newsletter Template, Appendix E – pg 103 ). A small token of appreciation will be provided 
to all mothers ($15 USD/$[ADDRESS_576023]) per completed assessment.  Upon completion  
of the 12 -month questionnaire, participants will be entered in a raffle to receive a $[ADDRESS_576024].  The raffle will be held for every 100 participants who complete the 
questionnaire. Upon completion of the child assessment, participants will be provided  a 
$[ADDRESS_576025] the option to complete the child assessment at the site hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307];  
(2) Tracking Strategies : REDCap™ will be used as a study -specific computerized  tracking 
system to calculate follow -up dates. We will request permission from each participant for 
two secondary contacts (e.g., relative or friend) in the event that we lose contact [CONTACT_151525].  In the event that we are not able to reach the pa rticipant and we reach out to 
a secondary contact, no information about the participant will be released to the 
secondary contact ( see Secondary Contact [CONTACT_23094], Appendix E – Study Documents, pg 83).  
We will verify and update contact [CONTACT_451830] -up 
session.  Email or telephone reminders will be sent to participants prior to each 
appointment or assessment;  
30 
 
SUMMIT Protocol V20: [ADDRESS_576026] 2024    
   
  (3) Personnel Strategies : All research staff will be trained and possess the following skills: (i) 
the capacity to communica te enthusiasm about the study; (ii) interpersonal persistence in 
a manner that is highly respectful; and (iii) a non -judgmental, empathic attitude. Research 
assistants will work flexible hours In order to accommodate telephone interviews at non -
standard ti mes. We used these strategies in our previous prevention (retention = 85% at 
24 weeks postpartum) and treatment (retention = 87% at [ADDRESS_576027] -randomization) 
trials.  
3.3. Participant Withdrawal   
Participants can withdraw consent and end their particip ation in the study at any time. Non -
completers and patients who do not respond to treatment will be referred to a trial psychiatrist 
or referred pathway (family physician, OBGYN, or external psychiatric services).  
3.4.  Data Management  
3.4.1.  Quantitativ e Data.  Quantitative data will be collected in identical REDCapTM databases 
kept on secure institutional servers within each of the three participating cities.  De -identified 
data from the US hubs will be extracted from the hub’s REDCapTM database, encrypt ed, and 
transferred to Toronto, where it will be uploaded, entered, and stored in REDCap™ hosted at 
The HUB: Health Research Solutions in the Li Ka Shing Knowledge Institute. REDCap™ is a 
secure, web -based application designed to support data capture for r esearch studies, providing 
1) an intuitive interface for validated data entry; 2) audit trails for tracking data manipulation 
and export procedures; 3) automated export procedures for seamless data downloads to 
common statistical packages; and 4) procedure s for importing data from external sources.  Data 
collected via REDCap™ at The HUB, or uploaded to The HUB from US hubs, will be encrypted 
and stored on the local Storage Area Network (SAN) within St. Michael’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_451789] -site. The data center is designed such that there are daily 
backups made of all critical data. In addition, the backups are stored both locally, as well as at a 
remote off -site location, in the case of catastrophic failure at one location. With limited access 
privileges, 24 -hour security, and around -the-clock monitoring, the data center is highly secure. 
Upon providing informed consent, participants will be assigned a unique study ID.  Participants 
will receive emailed links to complete study ass essments linked to their unique study ID profile 
in REDCap™. The cross walk for the study ID to personal information will be stored at each site 
in a password protected, encrypted file on a secure server within the institution.  Participants 
will be identi fied in REDCap™ by [CONTACT_74218]. REDCapTM will store participant emails in a 
separate server from the study data.  The emails will be inaccessible to study staff and 
protected against data export by [CONTACT_451831] a secure server in the REDCap backend, 
inaccessible to any study staff.  Treatment data will be collected by [CONTACT_13917], child 
assessments will be collected by [CONTACT_49165], and all entered on the same 
REDCap™ system.  
 
3.4.2.  Qualitative Data.  All study interviews and focus groups will be audio -recorded using a 
digital voice recorder.  
31 
 
SUMMIT Protocol V20: [ADDRESS_576028] 2024    
   
  [IP_ADDRESS]. Qualitative Phase 1.  Clinical Leads and Treatment Providers will be consented 
to the interviews and focus groups over the phone  or a secure ZoomTM accou nt from Toronto.  
All participants  will be sent a link to their completed consent form in REDCapTM for their 
records .  A research staff person will arrange a time and call them to review the consent.  If 
they consent to participate, the research staff wi ll ask them if they can record their consent.  
They will turn on the recorder, summarize the consent discussion, and ask the interviewee if 
they agree and consent.  Once they give recorded informed consent, the interview will begin. 
Interviews and focus gr oups with the Clinical Leads and Treatment Providers will be conducted 
from Toronto, either in -person or via ZoomTM—a secure and PHIPA -/HIPAA -compliant software 
used for remote communication.  The recording will be coded with the provider and supervisor 
ID and the date. No identifying information will be listed on the name [CONTACT_451865]. Audio files will 
be transcribed and identifiers removed during transcription.  All study procedures for handling 
study audio -recorded data will be reviewed with study personn el every quarter to ensure that 
protocols are implemented with fidelity throughout the life of the study. Only approved 
research staff with a need to review or analyze data will have access.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Qualitative Phase 2.   
Participants and significant othe rs will be asked for informed consent, either in -person 
or over the phone  or a secure  ZoomTM account , by [CONTACT_451832]. Interviews and focus groups will be scheduled by 
[CONTACT_451833], and will be hosted over ZoomTM and 
conducted by [CONTACT_451834].  This will ensure that PHI does not leave each 
study though the interviewer may be located at a different site.  All study procedures for 
handling study audio -recorded data will be reviewed with study personnel every quarter to 
ensure that protocols are implemented with fidelity throughout the life of the study. Only 
approved research staff with a need to review or analyze data will have access.  
      
Stakeholders involved in the SUMMIT Trial (ie. Committee members, attend ance at  
stakeholder meetings, etc.) will be invited via email to participate in a qualitative interview or 
focus group ( see SUMMIT Stakeholder Email Interview Invite,  Appendix E – Study Documents, 
pg 61 ).  If they are interested, they will be consented by [CONTACT_451835], either in -person or over the phone  or a secure  ZoomTM account .  
Interviews will be conducted from Toronto either in -person or via ZoomTM—a secure and 
PHIPA -/HIPAA -compliant software used for remote  communication.  The recording will be 
coded with the provider and supervisor ID and the date. No identifying information will be 
listed on the name [CONTACT_451865]. Audio files will be transcribed and identifiers removed during 
transcription.  All study proce dures for handling study audio -recorded data will be reviewed 
with study personnel every quarter to ensure that protocols are implemented with fidelity 
throughout the life of the study. Only approved research staff with a need to review or analyze 
data wil l have access.  
 
3.4.3. Audio -Recordings. Audio -recordings of BA sessions will be stored locally at each site and 
will adhere to local privacy and data management policies.  Audio -recordings may be securely 
32 
 
SUMMIT Protocol V20: [ADDRESS_576029] 2024    
   
  transferred between sites within a hub to allow th e clinical lead and independent consultant’s 
review.   
3.5.  Statistical Analyses  
3.5.1.  Primary Analysis.  Using SAS 9.4, primary analyses will be performed based on an intent -
to-treat basis. Two -sided significance levels of p<0.05 will be used for all analyses. Demographic 
(ethnicity, age, marital status) and other baseline variables (e.g., severity and chronicity) will be 
compared for potential differences between study groups using descriptive statistics (means, 
standard deviations, proportions) and t he associated statistical tests (t -tests, chi -square tests). 
Those who drop out of the study will also be compared to those completing the study on 
baseline indices including maternal education and occupation. The primary outcome of non -
inferiority in EPDS  scores will be compared between groups (telemedicine vs in -person, and 
specialist vs NSP) at [ADDRESS_576030]. The assessment period will be extended in the 
event that there is a hiatus to treatment due to significant perinatal -related life events (e.g., 
giving birth, obstetrical complications or COVID -19). One t -test will be run to assess this and 
compare modes (is telemedicine non -inferior to in -person). Another t -test will be run to assess 
this and compare agents (is non -specialist non -inferior t o specialist). Each t -test will look at the 
confidence interval around the difference in EPDS scores (say between telemedicine and in -
person), and see if the upper bound contains the 10 % (provider)  or 13 % (modality) non-
inferiority margin (upper bound for the case in which we take the difference to be telemedicine 
minus in -person).  We will conduct a sensitivity analysis to examine potential differences in 
baseline and outcome depressive symptoms and anxiety symptom s cores to determine 
whether participants who were recruited and received treatment during the COVID -19 
outbreak differed significantly from the larger sample.  
In addition, we will run a linear regression model with mode, agent and a mode by [CONTACT_451836]. In the 
unlikely event that randomization was not able to reduce bias by [CONTACT_451837], 
we will assess for confounding. This will be carried out by [CONTACT_451838] (mode or agent) and seeing if the potential 
confounder impacts the parameter estimate of the key predictor using the 10% change in 
estimate approach. The potential confounder would also need to be si gnificantly related to the 
EPDS score outcome. Should any confounders exist, they’ll will be included in all of the 
previously mentioned analyses. Rules on the number of variables allowed in a multivariable 
model will be followed. The rule on number of var iables in a linear regression is to take the 
total number of observations divided by 10. Given our trial sample size, we will not have any 
concerns with overfitting our linear model for our covariates of interest (education level, 
marital status, ethnicity , baseline severity and chronicity, timing of treatment, compliance, 
perceived support and medication).  
Our study statistician and two independent methodological consultants have reviewed 
and approved this plan of analysis.  
 
3.5.2.  Secondary Analysis.  In our secondary analysis, we are interested in: i) assessing the 
trend in EPDS scores over time (baseline, 3, [ADDRESS_576031] -randomization) between 
33 
 
SUMMIT Protocol V20: [ADDRESS_576032] 2024    
   
  groups (telemedicine vs in -person, and specialist vs NSP). This will involve the use of linear 
mixed  models adjusting for possible covariates including baseline depression symptoms, 
medication, treatment dosage, and child age when assessing child outcomes. Mothers will be 
taken as a random effect and the models will include a treatment - by- time interact ion term; ii) 
the same set of analyses will be conducted for anxiety symptoms (GAD -7). All child outcomes, 
including child mental development and the provision of psychosocial stimulation by [CONTACT_451839], will be compared between two groups (antenatal vs. po stnatal) at [ADDRESS_576033] session to see if the results are comparable to the entire 
study group. No interim analyses wi ll be carried out.  
 
3.5.3.  Subgroup Analyses.  Moderating effects will be conducted to determine whether 
delivery mode (telemedicine vs. in -person) or agent (specialist vs. non -specialist) have 
differential effects as a function of initial severity, whet her mothers who receive antenatal 
treatment have lower depressive symptoms at [ADDRESS_576034] -enrollment than those who 
receive postnatal treatment; and whether children whose mothers receive the antenatal 
treatment have higher child development scores at [ADDRESS_576035] child birth than those 
children whose mothers receive postnatal treatment.   
[IP_ADDRESS].  Clinical Severity.  Tests of moderation will be conducted to determine whether 
delivery mode (telemedicine vs. in -person) or agent (specialist vs. non -specialist) influence 
mothers who are severely depressed (EPDS>19)77. We expect 10 to 15% of our sample to be 
severely depressed (EPDS>19). A 2 -group comparison with 75 per group and an assumed mean 
EPDS score of 20.0 (SD=7.0 77, will provide 80% power, with  an alpha of 0.05, to detect a mean 
change of 2.[ADDRESS_576036] adequate power for clinically 
meaningful tests. The two groups’ (specialist vs non -specialist) EPDS scores at [ADDRESS_576037]. Change in EPDS score over time (baseline and 
every [ADDRESS_576038] -randomization) will also be compared using linear mixed models. We will 
also examine this on anxiety symptoms at [ADDRESS_576039] randomization.  
 [IP_ADDRESS].  Perinatal Period. This model will also test whether expectant mothers who 
receive antenatal t reatment benefit more in terms of reduced depressive symptoms than 
mothers who receive postnatal treatment at [ADDRESS_576040] -randomization. A 2 -group 
comparison with 200 per group and an assumed mean of EPDS score of 7.93 (SD=4.68) will 
provide 90% power, with an alpha of 0.05, to detect a mean change of 1.[ADDRESS_576041] size of 0.3 (i.e., a drop to mean 6.43 on the 
EPDS). The two groups’ (antenatal vs. postnatal) EPDS scores at [ADDRESS_576042]. Change in EPDS scores over time (baseline and every [ADDRESS_576043] -randomization) also will be compared using linear mixed models including the 
interaction between group and time. We will examine anxiety symptoms at [ADDRESS_576044] 
randomization in a linear mixed model controlling for relevant covariates including child age.  
We will examine the hypothesis of whether the subset of mothers (up to 75% of the 
sample) who receive the antenatal treatment will benefit mor e in terms of improved child 
34 
 
SUMMIT Protocol V20: [ADDRESS_576045] 2024    
   
  outcomes at 6 -24 months than mothers who receive postnatal treatment. A 2 -group 
comparison of 238 per group (antenatal vs. postnatal) and an assumed mean on any Bayley IV 
raw subscale score of 100, SD=15 to assess child mental development will provide 80% power, 
with an alpha of 0.[ADDRESS_576046] a mean clinically -significant change of 3.0 units. Raw and 
standardized Bayley IV scores of the two groups’ children (antenatal vs. postnatal) at [ADDRESS_576047].  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Treatment Providers.  Competency measures from the training sessions among 
both types of treatment providers (specialists and non -specialists) will be compared with 
participant outcomes to determine if competency scores duri ng training predict participant 
outcomes.  Key variables related to competency will include treatment -specific skills (range 
mean score of 0 -4) and general skills (range mean score of 0 -4) as measured by [CONTACT_941] Q -HAP and 
a total score (range 0 -35) of a 35 -item multiple choice exam (range total score of 0 -35). All 
analyses will be conducted using SAS 9.4.  Means, SDs and ranges of all competency measures 
for each individual NSP and across NSPs. This will be followed by [CONTACT_451840] y measures by [CONTACT_451841].  Finally, multiple 
regression analyses will be used to estimate whether competency measures can predict patient 
outcomes scores of EPDS and GAD -[ADDRESS_576048] -treatment. Covariates including baseline EPDS 
scores and treatment provider will be utilized to account for potential baseline heterogeneity.   
 
3.5.4.  Qualitative Analysis.  All qualitative data will be analyzed using NVivo™, a qualitative 
data analysis software package. We will use content analysis with data analysis (coding) 
conducted by [CONTACT_451842], for whom inter -rater reliability will be calculated 
using Kappa (κ) scores. Coding will be conducted in a step -wise fashion to facilitate iterative 
revision and then finalization of a co ding scheme. Specifically, there will be a process of first 
independently coding and then discussing a minimum of 3 cases per stakeholder group to 
achieve a kappa (κ) score of κ=0.75 or higher (defined as substantial to almost perfect 
agreement). Qualitati ve data will then be quantified and triangulated across stakeholder groups 
using our previously established methods21,78. 
 
3.5.[ADDRESS_576049] pro vider and telemedicine vs. in -person sessions (in 
line with the clinical analyses) and will follow CADTH guidelines 79. As such, we will adopt the 
health system perspective.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Cost -effectiveness analyses . The primary economic evaluation will be a co st-
utility analysis (a cost -effectiveness analysis where outcomes are measured using a utility 
measure) carried out at the [ADDRESS_576050] deviations. 
Mean differences and 95% confidence intervals will be obtained by [CONTACT_105] -parametric bootstrap 
regressions to account for the non -normal distribution of the data80. A secondary analysis will 
be a cost -effectiveness analysis using the primary clinical outcome measure, the EPDS41 at [ADDRESS_576051] -effectiveness will be assessed using the net benefit 
approach81 with reference to Bosmans ’ methods for economic evaluations alongside 
35 
 
SUMMIT Protocol V20: [ADDRESS_576052] -effectiveness ratios (ICERs) will be 
calculated, defined as the mean difference in cost between two groups divided by [CONTACT_451843]. Uncer tainty will be explored using cost -effectiveness planes and cost -
effectiveness acceptability curves (CEACs) based on the net -benefit approach83. Cost -
effectiveness planes illustrate the uncertainty around the estimates of costs and effects by 
[CONTACT_451844], with points in each quadrant indicating a different 
implication for economic evaluation84. CEACs are an alternative to confidence intervals around 
ICERs and show the probability that one intervention is cost -effective compare d to another, for 
a range of values that a decision maker would be willing to pay for a unit improvement in the 
outcome of interest83.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Sensitivity and subgroup analyses.  To explore the potential impact of excluding 
non-responders, we will examine  the sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of those 
included in the analyses and those in the full sample. Further, we will rerun the primary and 
secondary cost -effectiveness analyses with missing total costs and outcomes imputed using 
multiple imp utation by [CONTACT_3006]. We will explore the possibility of conducting 
subgroup analyses related to heterogeneity due to clinical severity and perinatal period 
(antenatal or postnatal), in line with proposed clinical analyses. We will examine geograph ic 
location by [CONTACT_451845].  
 
3.5.6.  Missing Data.  Strategies to reduce missing data have been discussed above. In addition, 
study staff will make at least four attempts to contact [CONTACT_451846]. Multiple imputation methods will be used when rates of missing data for a va riable 
exceed 20%. Five imputed datasets will be created and the model results averaged across the 
five iterations. SAS’s Proc MI and Proc MIANALYZE will be used to carry out the procedures. 
Linear mixed models will be used to assess repeated measures outc omes. These models use 
maximum likelihood estimation methods that retain patients who do not have complete data 
across all time points. Reasons for dropout will be ascertained from clinician records or 
interviewing a subset of the participants who dropped out and coded. Sensitivity analyses will 
be carried out should missing data lead to the use of multiple imputation methods. These 
analyses will compare the results of the models on the imputed data to the ones with the actual 
missing data included. For the  economic evaluation, participant health records will be accessed 
retrospectively to ensure that all health services accessed and costs incurred are captured.  In 
Toronto, we will work with the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences (ICES) to collect t hese 
data.  
3.6.  Data Retention  
Study data will be kept for [ADDRESS_576053] practices.  
36 
 
SUMMIT Protocol V20: [ADDRESS_576054] (DSMB) will consi st of four persons, including a 
psychiatrist with expertise in perinatal depressive or anxiety symptoms, a medical provider with 
expertise in providing obstetric care for pregnant women, a psychologist with expertise in the 
design and implementation of pra gmatic clinical trials, and a PhD -level statistician. None of 
these persons will be involved directly in the study. The DSMB will have the following aims:  
• To assure the safety, privacy, and confidentiality of human subjects.  
• To assure the reliability, vali dity, completeness, and integrity of the data collection and 
management process.  
• To review implementation of the protection of human subjects protocol, including 
amendments made in relation to safety concerns.  
• To review all serious adverse events, rates of  dropout or study withdrawal, and rates of 
missing data.  
 
4.2.  Reporting  
The Trial Steering Management (TSM) Subcommittee will present regular reports to the 
Advisory Committee, and the Data and Safety Monitoring Board. These include:  
• Monthly Recruitmen t Reports  - reports of the number of women screened and enrolled by 
[CONTACT_451847].  
• Quarterly Steering Committee Reports  - reports detailing recruit ment, baseline patient 
characteristics, data quality, missing data and protocol adherence by [CONTACT_138554], are 
provided quarterly to the TSM Subcommittee and all members of the Steering Committee.  
• Data and Safety Monitoring Board Reports - a report wil l be prepared for every DSMB 
meeting that includes patient recruitment, baseline patient characteristics, center 
performance with respect to data quality, timeliness of data submission and protocol 
adherence (in addition to safety and efficacy data). The r eports also include serious adverse 
events, loss to follow -up and all outcome variables as described previously in this protocol.  
4.3.  Serious Adverse Events  
Within 72 hours of a serious adverse event (SAE), the Trial Management Committee will report 
the event to the DSMB, including the details of the event, the severity of any reactions, the 
phase of the study, and the procedures for its resolution, and will report to the IRB of record 
(Appendix D – Adverse Events ). In addition, the Project Administrator  will ensure that the 
assigned PCORI program officer is informed of any actions taken by [CONTACT_451848] a result 
of such events. The DSMB meet twice per year for the study duration. Members will also meet 
via conference calls if SAEs attributable to study procedures are reported.  
37 
 
SUMMIT Protocol V20: [ADDRESS_576055] 
been adapted from previous studies54 (detailed in Appendix A –Safety Protocols and Forms ). In 
brief, a multi step process will be followed:  
● Monitoring treatment quality.  BA delivery will be extensively monitored during the study 
using previously established methods developed and tested by [CONTACT_978].   
⮚ Training Phase.  During the training phase, clinical leads will host weekly supervision 
meetings with NSPs  and specialist providers  to review and discuss cases and 
reinforce BA training.  Independent consultants will evaluate treatment among 5% 
of all audio sessions to as sess treatment adherence and fidelity. Treatment providers 
not reaching the mean cut -off for specific items will receive refresher training by [CONTACT_451849]. In addition, quality indicators of NSP and specialist -delivered 
sessions will be collected including the number, mode of delivery and duration of 
sessions.  
⮚ Trial Phase.  During the trial phase, NSPs  will continue to attend weekly supervision 
meetings to review and discuss cases.  Once per month, clinical leads and NSPs will 
rate individual audio -recorded sessions for therapy quality —the extent to which a 
psychological treatment was implemented well enough to achieve its expected 
effects85—of audio -recorded sessions in a monthly structured supervision. Audio 
recordings will be rated using the 20 -item Q -HAP52 for BA -treatment -specific and 
common (e.g., collaboration, empathy) skills. The individual NSP who conducted the 
session (self -rating), two to three peers (peer ratings) and a clinical lead (expert 
rating) will rate each session. The summed sco re for each subscale will be used to 
estimate therapy quality for each NSP and compared to expert ratings.  Specialists  
will not attend regular supervision, but supervision will be available to them on an 
ad hoc basis to reflect real -world conditions.  
⮚ Independent consultants will continue to evaluate treatment among 5% of all audio 
sessions, by [CONTACT_451850], to assess treatment adherence and fidelity. 
Treatment providers not reaching the mean cut -off for specific items will receive 
refresher t raining by [CONTACT_58686].  
● Notification and Plan for Severe Session -Wise Scores. Depression scores on the EPDS will 
be assessed at the beginning of each session. Any mother who has a positive response on 
the self -harm ideation item will undergo the standard safety protocol and in the case of 
active suicidal ideation, will be further as sessed by a trial perinatal psychiatrist or associated 
Emergency Department for further assessment as is currently in practice at each of our 
three hubs. Women with worsening symptom scores on post -baseline EPDS session -by-
session assessments during the in tervention phase will be reviewed by [CONTACT_451851], including recommendations around a need 
for emergency assessm ent. 24 -hr emergency psychiatric care is available at each hub. For 
concerns about maternal self -harm or infant/child harm that arise during the intervention, 
38 
 
SUMMIT Protocol V20: [ADDRESS_576056] ( Appendix A –Safety Protocols and 
Forms ).  
● Post -Intervention Protocols.  If a participant has an EPDS >[ADDRESS_576057] -treatment 
outcome assessment or at any subsequent assessment, the participant’s most responsible 
provider (e.g. midwife, obstetrician, family physician or psychiatrist) will be informed by [CONTACT_451852], if the participant is not already enrolled in care with a perinatal mental 
health team, information will be given for how to  initiate referral to additional specialty 
psychiatric care with the participant’s consent.  For concerns about maternal self -harm or 
infant/child harm that arise during the follow -up period, we will follow an established 
protocol, used effectively in our previous trials24,53,54, which will be supervised by [CONTACT_451853] ( Appendix A –Safety Protocols and Forms ).  
● Extensive Training.  All providers, including specialists will have completed an extensive 
training program focused on the d evelopment and evaluation of core competencies in BA 
and common counseling skills, followed by [CONTACT_451854] a clinical lead.  
● Negative Intervention Effects  will be assessed for through regular evaluations on a monthly 
basis by [CONTACT_451855] (SAE’s).  
● Measuring Child Outcomes. Trained research assistants will conduct post -child birth 
assessments (months 6 -24) as per hospi[INVESTIGATOR_451790].  
● Informing the Patient’s Provider.  With participa nt consent ( see Participation in SUMMIT 
Health Care Provider Fax/Email Template, Appendix E – Study Documents, pg. 101), we will 
inform the patient’s regular provider with the results of screening (i.e., EPDS score and 
eligibility into SUMMIT) via electron ic message (using the electronic health record when 
available) or via fax or mailed letter. We also will communicate with the patient’s provider 
at the end of the study for each participant with a letter summarizing all follow -up and 
management strategies implemented and final symptomatology results.  All provider 
information will be kept on site in an encrypted file on a secure server and linked to the 
participant by [CONTACT_195609].  We have completed these interdisciplinary communication 
strategies before with no difficulties in previous maternal depression trials24,53,86,87. 
● Incidental Findings. If any unexpected, clinically important information about a participant’s 
or their child’s health is suspected, the study team may contact [CONTACT_451856]. The Site PI [INVESTIGATOR_451791], consult with specialists if 
needed while protecting the participant’s identity, and determine whether the participant 
should be contact[CONTACT_451857].  
5  ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION  
5.1.  Research  Ethics Approval  
In Toronto, we will seek ethical approval from Clinical Trials Ontario (CTO) Stream —a system 
that allows one CTO -Qualified Research Ethics Board (REB) to oversee the ethical approval and 
conduct of research occurring at multiple sites in  Ontario, streamlining the REB application 
process (SHS, SMH, and WCH).  In North Carolina, we will seek ethical approval from the UNC 
Biomedical Institution Review Board. In Chicago, we will seek ethical approval from the 
39 
 
SUMMIT Protocol V20: [ADDRESS_576058] their safety, including changes of study objectives, study design, patient population, 
sample sizes, study procedures, or signific ant administrative aspects will require a formal 
amendment to the protocol. Such amendment will be agreed upon by [CONTACT_451858]/IRB (Institutional Review Board) prior to implementation and to the health 
authorities notified in accordance with local regulations. Amendments in relation to safety 
concerns will also be reviewed by [CONTACT_451859].  Administrative changes 
are minor corrections or clarifications that have no effect on the way the study is to be 
conducted. These administrative changes will be agreed upon by [CONTACT_451860], and will be documented 
in a memorandum. The REB/IRB will be notified of administrative changes as necessary.  
 
5.3.  Confidentiality   
To ensure confidentiality, data dispersed to relevant team members (inc luding the PI [INVESTIGATOR_196054]) will be blinded of any identifying participant information and treatment 
allocation.  Only the site recruitment research assistants, research assistants responsible for 
scheduling appointments, and treatment provide rs will have access to the identifying 
participant information. All information will be kept in password -protected, encrypted files on 
encrypted computers and secure servers. Unique Study IDs will be used to identify the 
participants with Key Files kept at  the site from which the participant was recruited.  The Key 
File will be encrypted and stored on an encrypted computer or a secure server within each trial 
site institution.  
5.4.  Declaration of Interests  
There are no conflicts of interest.  
 
5.5.  Data Ma nagement  
The Data Manager will oversee the intra -study data sharing process, with input from the Trial 
Steering Committee. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_451792]. Quantitative data will be collected via REDCapTM at each hub separately, exported, 
encrypted and securely transferred to Toronto, where it will be housed in encrypted files on the 
local Storage Area Network (SAN) within St. Michael’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], and will be backed up regularly 
and stored off -site. The data ce nter is designed such that there are daily backups made of all 
critical data. In addition, the backups are stored both locally, as well as at a remote off -site 
location, in the case of catastrophic failure at one location. With limited access privileges, [ADDRESS_576059] access to their own site’s data and may have access to other sites’ data by [CONTACT_32236].

SUMMIT Protocol V20: [ADDRESS_576060] consented to be contact[CONTACT_451861], offered to provide testimonies based on previous visits, and/or to be 
contact[CONTACT_5646], if they would like to provide testimonials about their experien ces 
with the SUMMIT Trial. These testimonials will be used for SUMMIT dissemination and 
knowledge mobilization purposes, and may include text quotes and/or or audio -visual materials 
such as photos, audio or voice. Those participants, significant others, an d treatment providers 
who would like to provide testimonials will be provided with the opportunity to consent to, or 
not consent to, each specific type of testimonial (i.e., text, photos, audio, video). They will be 
made aware that publication of these tes timonials may appear in media available to the public, 
for example in newsletters, brochures, websites and videos, and will also be informed of the 
potential risks involved ( see ICF Testimonial Addenda , Appendix E – Study Documents , pg. 41 – 
56).

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 4 Study Design:  
This is an international (approximately 100 sites), phase 2, open -label, randomized, active -control 
study of zanubrutinib plus obinutuzumab versus obinutuzumab monotherapy in 210 patients with 
relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma.  The primary efficacy endpoint is overall response rate 
(ORR) determined by [CONTACT_69795].  Disease response will be assessed per the Lugano 
Classification for Non -Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL) ( Cheson et al, 2014 ) — hereafter referred to as 
Lugano Classification for NHL.  
Central randomization (2:1) will be used to assign patients to one of the following study drug 
treatments:  
Arm A : zanub rutinib plus obinutuzumab  
Arm B : obinutuzumab monotherapy  
Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_732531] (2 to 3 versus ˃  3), 
rituximab -refractory status (yes vs no), and geographic region (China vs ex -China).  Treatment with 
zanu brutinib plus obinutuzumab and treatment with obinutuzumab monotherapy will be open label.  
Study treatment must commence within 5  days after randomization.   
Study Schema  
Abbreviation: NHL, non -Hodgkin lymphoma.  
a Randomization stratified by [CONTACT_732531] (2 to 3 vs >  3), rituximab -refractory status (yes 
vs no), and geographic region (China vs ex -China).  
b Option for addition of zanubrutinib following independent central confirmation of disease response status.  
Each cycle consists of 28 days.  Study drug treatments will be administered as follows, depending on 
cohort and treatment assignment:  
Zanubrutinib will be administered as two 80 -mg capsules by [CONTACT_326372] a day (160 mg twice a day) 
with or without food.  
Obinutuzumab will be a dministered 1,000 mg intravenously on days 1, 8, and 15 of Cycle 1, then 
1,000  mg on Day 1 of Cycles 2 to 6, then 1,000 mg every 8 weeks.  (At the discretion of the 
investigator, obinutuzumab may be administered 100 mg on Day 1 and 900 mg on Day 2 of Cycle 1 
instead of 1,000 mg on Day 1 of Cycle 1.)  Responding patients may continue to receive maintenance 
obinutuzumab every 8 weeks for an additional 24 months (eg, maximum total duration of 
obinutuzumab of approximately 30 months  [maximum 20 doses] ). 
At the discretion of the investigator, patients in arm B will be eligible to receive crossover treatment 
with zanubrutinib plus obinutuzumab if they experience progressive disease or their disease does not 
respond to therapy with a complete response (CR) or parti al response (PR) after [ADDRESS_1000802] 2021  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 5 Study Assessments  
Assessments of follicular lymphoma status during the study include: disease -related constitutional 
symptoms, physical examination of lymph nodes, liver, and sple en, complete blood count (CBC), bone 
marrow examination, positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) scan with 
contrast of neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis, patient -reported outcomes (PROs; EQ -5D-5L and 
EORTC QLQ -C30 questionnaires).  
Tumor assessments, including imaging studies, will be performed at screening, every [ADDRESS_1000803] scan during screening.  Patients 
whose disease is not [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) -avid at screening will be followed by [CONTACT_4654] -based 
assessments alone.  Patients wh ose disease is FDG -avid at screening will be followed by [CONTACT_732532] -CT and CT -based assessments as follows:   
• PET-CT scans are required at screening, end of Cycles 3, 6, and 12, and to confirm a result on CT 
scan (CR/PR or disease progression)  
• CT scans with contrast are required at all other tumor response assessments  
Patients receiving zanubrutinib should remain on study treatment until disease progression is confirmed 
by [CONTACT_69795].  Patients receiving obinutuzumab should remai n on study treatment 
until either disease progression is confirmed by [CONTACT_732533]  
30 months of treatment with obinutuzumab  (maximum 20 doses) , whichever occurs first.  
Assessments of safety will include adverse events (AEs),  serious adverse events (SAEs), clinical 
laboratory tests, physical examinations, and vital signs.  AEs will be graded for severity per National 
Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI -CTCAE).  An independent 
data monitoring co mmittee (DMC) will periodically monitor safety data.  
Key Eligibility Criteria:  
The patients to be included in this trial will have a histologically confirmed diagnosis of B -cell 
follicular lymphoma (Grade 1, 2 or 3a) based on the World Health Organization  (WHO) [ADDRESS_1000804] 
received ≥ 2 prior systemic treatments for follicular lymphoma  (including an anti -CD20 antibody and 
an appropriate alkylator -based combination therapy).  Patients will have no currently active clinically 
significant cardiovascular disease, and no active infection with hepatitis B or C or HIV.  
Test Product, Dose, and Mode of Administration:   
Zanubrutinib will be administered as two 80 -mg capsules by [CONTACT_326372] a day (160 mg twice a day) 
with or without food.  Patients will take zanubrutinib with water at approximately the same time every 
day, with  a minimum of 8 hours between consecutive doses.  Zanubrutinib capsules should not be 
opened, broken, or chewed at any time.  
Reference Therapy, Dose, and Mode of Administration:   
Obinutuzumab will be administered 1,000 mg intravenously on days 1, 8, and 15 of Cycle 1, then 
1,000  mg on Day 1 of Cycles 2 to 6, then 1,000 mg every 8 weeks.  (At the discretion of the 
investigator, obinutuzumab may be administered 100 mg on Day 1 and 900 mg on Day 2 of Cycle 1 
instead of 1,000 mg on Day 1 of Cycle 1.)  Responding patients may continue to receive maintenance 
obinutuzumab every 8 weeks for an additional 24 months (eg, maximum total duration of 
obinutuzumab of approximately 30 months  [maximum 20 doses] ). 
Version .[ADDRESS_1000805] 2021  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 6 Obinutuzumab should be administered at a rate of 50 mg/hr.  The rate of the infusion can be escalated 
in 50  mg/hr increments every 30 minutes to a maximum of 400 mg/hr.  If no infusion reaction occurs 
during the Cycle 1 Day 1 infusion and the final infusio n rate was 100 mg/hr or faster, infusions can be 
started at a rate of 100  mg/hr and increased by 100 mg/hr increments every 30 minutes to a maximum 
of 400 mg/hr for all subsequent doses.  Patients should be premedicated with acetaminophen, 
antihistamine, a nd a glucocorticoid before each obinutuzumab infusion.  
Statistical Methods:  
All efficacy analyses will be performed using the Intent -to-Treat (ITT) analysis set (all patients who are 
randomized to a treatment group).  
Primary Efficacy Endpoint Analysis:  
Primary inference of comparing overall response rate by [CONTACT_732534] a 
Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel test adjusted for the randomization factors (number of prior lines of therapy 
[2 to 3 vs > 3] and rituximab -refractory status [yes v s no]) in the ITT analysis set.  
The null and alternative hypotheses for comparing overall response rate are as follows:  
 H0: ORR A = ORR B 
 Ha: ORR A > ORR B 
where ORR A is the overall response rate in arm A (zanubrutinib plus  obinutuzumab ) and ORR B is the 
overall response rate in arm B (o binutuzumab monotherapy ).  If the obtained one -sided p -value is 
≤ 0.025, it will be concluded that the combination therapy of zanubrutinib plus obinutuzumab results in 
a statistically significantly increase in overall response rate versus obinutuzumab monotherapy; thereby 
[CONTACT_732535] A over arm  B.  
Secondary Efficacy Endpoint Analyses:  
• Duration of response will be summarized only for patients who have achieved an objective 
response.  The distribution of duration of response will be summarized for each treatment 
group by [CONTACT_8761] -Meier method.  
• Progression -free survival (PFS) will be compared based on the log -rank test stratified by [CONTACT_150087] (number of prior lines of therap y [2 to 3 vs > 3], rituximab 
refractory status [yes vs no], and geographic region [China vs ex -China]).  The distribution of 
progression -free survival, including median progression -free survival and progression -free 
survival rate at selected timepoints, wi ll be estimated using the Kaplan -Meier method for each 
arm. 
• Overall survival between the 2 treatment groups will be compared using the same methods 
employed for the PFS comparison.  The distribution of overall survival (including median and 
other quartiles) and overall survival rate at selected timepoints will be estimated by [CONTACT_17680] -Meier method  
• Complete response rate and complete metabolic response rate will be calculated as the 
proportion of patients who reached best overall response of compl ete response (complete 
metabolic response) or higher.  The complete response and complete metabolic response rate 
will be compared between treatment groups using Fisher’s exact test.  
• Time -to-response will be summarized only for responders by [CONTACT_732536], m edian and 
standard deviation for each treatment group.  
• The EORTC QLQ -C30 and EQ -5D-5L questionnaires will be utilized.  The scores and their 
changes from baseline will be summarized and compared between two treatment groups  
Version .[ADDRESS_1000806] 2021  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 7 Exploratory Efficacy Endpoint Analysis:  
• Overall response rate in arm B after crossover to arm A will be summarized descriptively.  
Safety Analyses:  
The Safety analysis set (all patients who received any dose of study medication) will be used for all 
safety analyses.  
Drug exposure will be summarized by [CONTACT_732537], 
dosage, and dose intensity.   
All treatment -emergent AEs will be summarized.  SAEs, deaths, treatment -emergent AEs ≥ Grade 3, 
study drug -related treatment -emergent AEs, treatment -emergent AEs that led to treatment 
discontinuation, dose reduction or dose interruption will be summarized.  
Pharmacokinetic Analyses:  
Blood samples to assess plasma zanubrutinib concentrations will be collected in patients in arm  A. 
Plasma zanubrutinib concen trations will be summarized by [CONTACT_397809].  A population 
pharmacokinetics (PK) analysis may be performed to include plasma concentrations of zanubrutinib 
from this trial in an existing model.  PK parameters such as apparent clearance of t he drug from plasma 
and AUC 0-12 may be derived from the population PK analysis if supported by [CONTACT_33653].  
An exposure -response (efficacy or safety endpoints) analysis may be performed if supported by [CONTACT_33653].  
The results from the population PK and exposure -respon se analyses may be reported separately from 
the Clinical Study Report.  
Sample Size Considerations:  
The sample size calculation is based on the comparison of the primary endpoint of ORR in the ITT 
analysis set.  Assuming ORR A=0.55 and ORR B=0.30, 210 patient s will be enrolled in a 2:1 ratio 
(140 patients in arm A and 70 patients in arm B) to provide a power of approximately 91% in testing 
ORR A versus ORR B using a normal approximation to binomial distribution with a [ADDRESS_1000807] OF ABBREVIATI ONS AND TERMS  ................................ ................................ ................ 14

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 16 1. INTRODUCTION  
1.1. Follicular Lymphoma  
Follicular lymphoma is well characterized by [CONTACT_732538] (primarily lymph node 
enlargement), its morphologic characteristics (preservation of follicular lymph node architecture 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_732515]), and its molecular features (over 90% of cases 
are associated with a speci fic translocation between the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene on 
chromosome 14 and the bcl -2 oncogene on chromosome 18).  While there is considerable 
heterogeneity in the clinical course of follicular lymphoma, it is generally an indolent 
malignancy, with a prolonged but incurable clinical course.  A cross -European registry study 
published in 2015, calculated a median age at onset of 62 years and an annual incidence of 
5 cases per 100,000 population ( Mounier et al 2015 ).  Of note, the incidence of follicular 
lymphoma appears to be increasing significantly, from an estimated incidence of 2 to 
3 cases/100,000 population in the 1950s.  
Follicular lymphoma is classified by [CONTACT_732539].  The World Health Organization (WHO ) 
classification ( Swerdlow et al 2008 ; Jaffe 2009 ) grades follicular lymphoma based on the 
number of blasts per high powered field, where Grade [ADDRESS_1000817] a course 
identical to diffuse large B -cell lymphoma (DLBCL).  The Ann Arbor staging system method is 
also used ( Nationa l Comprehensive Cancer Network 2017 ; Dreyling et al 2017 ) to characterize 
follicular lymphoma by [CONTACT_64367]: stage I and II disease is considered localized, and may be suitable 
for local therapi[INVESTIGATOR_732516]; whereas stage III and IV disease is 
considered widespread, and is managed with systemic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
With modern chemoimmunotherapy for follicular lymphoma, median survival exceeds 10 years, 
except for the approximately 20% of patients wi th short remission duration following initial 
chemoimmunotherapy ( Casulo et al 2015 ).  In fact, over the past several decades, the 
incorporation of novel active agents into treatment practices for follicular lymphoma ha ve 
resulted in a decline in lymphoma subtype -specific mortality trends ( Howlader et al 2016 ).  Yet, 
follicular lymphoma remains incurable, and the clinical history is typi[INVESTIGATOR_732517], with successiv e treatment regimens resulting in progressively shorter disease -control 
intervals, until the emergence of fatal, resistant disease.  In addition to the morbidity and 
mortality associated with treatment resistance, cumulative treatment -related toxicity (esp ecially 
immunosuppression, myelosuppression, and secondary leukemia related to alkylator exposure), 
and transformation to DLBCL, remain significant contributors to mortality in patients with 
follicular lymphoma.  
Therapeutic strategies in follicular lymphom a have been transformed in recent decades by [CONTACT_732540] -CD20 monoclonal antibodies, used alone or as part of chemoimmunotherapy 
regimens.  For patients with a high tumor burden, the progression -free survival (PFS) benefit of 
adding rituximab to cytotoxic chemotherapy has been clearly demonstrated in randomized trials 
(Hiddemann et al 2005 ; Herold et al 2007 ; Schulz et al 2007 ; Marcus et al 2016 ; Bachy et al 
2013 ).  The chemoimmunotherapy regimens, rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and 
prednisolone; rituximab, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisolone; and benda mustine 
plus rituximab are all considered as treatment standards.  Rituximab maintenance after initial 
chemoimmunotherapy has also been shown in phase [ADDRESS_1000818] 2021  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 17 survival (OS; Sehn et al 2016 ).  Mo re recently, a phase 3 study has demonstrated that the second 
generation anti -CD20 antibody, obinutuzumab, plus chemotherapy, prolongs PFS as compared 
with rituximab plus chemotherapy ( Marcus et al 2016 ), and thus obin utuzumab is likely to be 
added soon to expert guidelines as appropriate for initial therapy.  
The treatment options are limited for patients with disease that has relapsed after or is refractory 
to chemoimmunotherapy.  In the rituximab -refractory setting, obinutuzumab plus bendamustine 
prolongs PFS as compared with bendamustine alone ( Sehn et al 2016 ).  Idelalisib, a 
phosphoinositol -3-kinase inhibitor approved by [CONTACT_6581] 
(FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for follicular lymphoma under their 
respective, accelerated and conditional approval mechanisms in 2013, is considered an 
appropriate treatment option for patients who have received at least 2 prior systemic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] 
(Zydelig Prescribing Information 2016 ; Zydelig Summary of Product Characteristics 2016 ).  
However, late -stage trials intended to confirm the clinical benefit of idelalisi b in follicular 
lymphoma were terminated early because of an imbalance in infectious deaths in the idelalisib 
arms of these studies ( Zydelig FDA Alerts 2016 ).  
1.2. Inhibition of Bruton Tyrosine Kinase in Follicular Lymph oma 
Inhibitors of Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) have been evaluated in follicular lymphoma and have 
shown modest single agent activity.  The first generation BTK inhibitor ibrutinib was evaluated 
in a phase 2 trial in 110 patients with “chemoimmunotherapy -resistant” follicular lymphoma, 
defined as having received at least 2 prior lines of therapy and demonstrated progressive disease 
within 12 months of a chemoimmunotherapy regimen.  In this study, the overall response rate 
(ORR) was 21% and the median durati on of response was 19.4 months ( Gopal et al 2016 ).   
1.3. Zanubrutinib (BGB -3111)  
Zanubrutinib, formerly designated as BGB -3111, is a potent, specific, and irreversible BTK 
inhibitor with a favorable pharmacologic and toxi cologic profile.  Zanubrutinib is different from 
ibrutinib in the following ways:  
1. Zanubrutinib is more selective in the relative inhibition of BTK versus off -target tyrosine 
kinases, including EGFR, FGR, FRK, HER2, HER4, ITK, JAK 3, LCK, and TEC. This 
may reduce toxicities possibly due to off -target inhibition such as diarrhea, 
thrombocytopenia, bleeding, atrial fibrillation, rash, and fatigue;  
2. Zanubrutinib has improved oral bioavailability;  
3. Zanubrutinib displays significantly less inhibitory effect on r ituximab -induced 
antibody -dependent cell -mediated cytotoxicity, and so is unlikely to adversely impact the 
antitumor effects of rituximab.  
1.3.1.  Summary of Relevant Nonclinical Data with Zanubrutinib  
Summaries of nonclinical studies are provided below.  For more  detailed information please refer 
to the zanubrutinib Investigator Brochure . 
Zanubrutinib is a potent, specific and irreversible BTK kinase inhibitor with a 50% maximum 
inhibitory concentration (IC 50) of 0.[ADDRESS_1000819] 2021  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 18 B-cell receptor aggregation -triggered BTK autophosphorylation, and blocks downstream PLCγ2 
signaling in mantle cell lymphoma cell lines.  Zanubrutinib had an IC 50 of 1.8 nM in a 
homogeneous time -resolved fluorescence -based BTKpY223 assay.  It potently and selectively 
inhibited cellular growth of several mantle cell lymphoma cell lines (REC -1, Mino and JeKo -1) 
and the activated B -cell type DLBCL cell line TMD -8, with IC [ADDRESS_1000820] REC -1 mantle cell lymphoma xenografts engrafted either subcutaneously or systemically 
in mice which are significantly more effective than ibrutinib.  Zanub rutinib also demonstrated 
better antitumor activity than ibrutinib in TMD -8 DLBCL subcutaneous xenograft model.  In a 
pharmacokinetic (PK)/pharmacodynamic study, oral administration of Zanubrutinib resulted in 
time-dependent occupancy of BTK in blood and i n spleen in mice, and was approximately 3 -fold 
more potent than ibrutinib in mouse pharmacodynamic assays.  
In a panel of 342 human kinases, 1 µM zanubrutinib inhibited only 12 other kinases by > 70%.  
Zanubrutinib was more selective than ibrutinib for inh ibition of kinase activity of BTK vs EGFR, 
FGR, FRK, HER2, HER4, ITK, JAK3, LCK, and TEC.  Cellular assays also confirmed that 
zanubrutinib is significantly less active than ibrutinib in inhibiting ITK (10 -fold) and EGFR 
(> 6-fold).  Inhibition of ITK has been reported to reduce rituximab -induced antibody -dependent 
cell-mediated cytotoxicity.  Zanubrutinib was shown to be at least [ADDRESS_1000821] been well characterized in rats and dogs.  No specific 
safety concer ns were identified in vital organs/systems including cardiovascular system, 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_2133], and central nervous systems.  No QTc changes were noted in the conscious 
telemetry -implanted dogs over 24  hours after dosing up to 100 mg/kg, or in the repeat d ose 
toxicity studies in dogs over 91 days at doses up to 100 mg/kg/day.  No mortality or severe 
toxicity was noted in 91 -day repeat dose toxicity studies in both rats and dogs at doses up to 
300 mg/kg and 100  mg/kg, respectively.  Test article -related reve rsible histopathology changes 
were mainly noted in rats, including pancreas, spleen, prostate gland, cecum, colon, rectum, skin 
(lip and/or nose), and uterus.  None of the above findings were considered to be adverse in the 
91-day repeated dosing studies.  No genotoxicity was noted in the genotoxicity core battery 
studies.  
1.3.2.  Summary of Relevant Clinical Experience with Zanubrutinib  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Dose Selection for Zanubrutinib  
In the first -in-human, phase 1 study, zanubrutinib -AU-003, the PK of zanubrutinib was linear 
between 40 mg and 320 mg once a day administered orally (BeiGene Investigator Brochure ).  
The absorption of zanubrutinib is rapid with median time to maximum plasma concentration 
(Cmax) of [ADDRESS_1000822], and mean area under the plasma concentration -time curve (AUC) and C max 
were increased by 12% and 51%, respectively with standard breakfast when compared with 
Version .[ADDRESS_1000823] 2021  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 19 fasting.  The magnitude of increase in exposure with food was well within doubling of exposure 
associated with 320 mg administered once a day in the ongoing phase 1, and was not associated 
with any new safety findings.  Therefore, zanubrutinib can be administered with or without food.  
Full occupancy of BTK in peripheral blood mononuclear cells was achieved in all patients in the 
BGB -3111 -AU-003 study, while occupancy in lymph node tissue was assessed only at 160 mg 
twice a day and 320 mg once a day ( Tam et al 2015 ).  At the 160 mg twice a day dose, full BTK 
occupancy was observed at trough, suggesting that sustained target occupancy could be ach ieved 
in disease -originating tissues, thus more efficiently inhibiting BTK on a continuous basis, further 
preventing breakthrough signaling despi[INVESTIGATOR_69773].  Activity has been 
observed across various B -cell malignancies (including chron ic lymphocytic leukemia [CLL], 
mantle cell lymphoma, Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia, and follicular lymphoma) at all tested 
dose levels; thus, a minimum effective dose cannot be established at this time.  Conversely, there 
is now extensive experience at the  160 mg twice a day and 320 mg once a day dose; both 
schedules show a high level of activity without compromising the tolerability profile as 
compared with lower doses of zanubrutinib.  Therefore, the dose of 160  mg administered orally 
twice a day has been  selected as the recommended phase 2 and phase 3 dose based on sustained 
target occupancy, high rates of objective response in multiple types of B -cell malignancies, and a 
favorable safety and tolerability profile.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Preliminary Efficacy and Safety Data with  Zanubrutinib  
There are two relevant studies of zanubrutinib that provide efficacy and safety data, the 
first-in-human study, BGB -[ADDRESS_1000824] 2014.  The study consists of 
two parts.  In part 1, the primary objectives are to determine the safety and tolerability of 
zanubrutinib in patients with various B -cell malignancies (CLL/small lymphocytic lymphoma 
[SLL], non -Hodgkin lymphoma [NHL], and Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia [WM]) and 
determine the recommended phase 2 dose.  In part 2, the primary objective is to further assess 
the safety and tolerability of zanub rutinib in patients with B -cell malignancies, while a secondary 
objective is to assess the anti -tumor activity of zanubrutinib at the recommended phase 2 dose.   
In the BGB -3111 -AU-003 CLL/SLL cohort, as of [ADDRESS_1000825] 12  weeks.  Zanubrutinib was well tolerated, with 65% of patients reporting no 
drug-related adverse events (AEs) >  Grade [ADDRESS_1000826] frequent AEs of any attribution 
were petechiae or purpura or contusion (combined events, 22 patients; 48 %), upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_19629] (33%; all Grade 1 or 2), fatigue (28%; all Grade 1 or 2), diarrhea, cough, and 
headache (all 20%; all Grade 1 or 2).  There were 3  serious adverse events (SAEs) assessed as 
possibly related to zanubrutinib (Grade 2 car diac failure, Grade 2 pleural effusion and Grade 3 
purpura).  After a median follow -up of 8.6 months (range, 2.2 to 20.9 months), the ORR was 
96% (44/46), with a partial response (PR) rate of 67% (31/46), partial response with 
lymphocytosis rate of 28% (13 /46), and stable disease (SD) rate of 2% (1/46).  Of the 8  patients 
with measurable disease at baseline, their tumor volume (sum of product diameters) decreased 
from 60% to 100% with a median decrease of 86%.  No instances of disease progression or 
Richter ’s transformation have occurred.   
Version .[ADDRESS_1000827] frequent AEs reported (all were Grade 1 or 2) were: upper 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_4416] (33%), contusion (2 8%), and constipation (22%).  There were 3 treatment -
related SAEs (Grade 2 atrial fibrillation, Grade 2 headaches, Grade 3 cryptococcal meningitis); 
in all 3 cases, zanubrutinib was withheld and safely resumed.  Three patients developed atrial 
fibrillation  (one Grade 1, two Grade 2, all events in patients without a previous history of atrial 
fibrillation), and [ADDRESS_1000828] discontinued zanubrutinib for AEs, 1 with an exacerbatio n of pre -existing 
bronchiectasis and 1 with prostate cancer.  The ORR was 93% (38/41); with a major response 
rate of 78% (32/41), including very good partial response rate of 39% (16/41) and PR rate of 
39% (16/41).  In patients with hemoglobin <  10 g/dL at  baseline, hemoglobin increased from a 
median of 8.8 g/dL to 13.8 g/dL and serum immunoglobulin M decreased from a median of 
32.5 g/L at baseline to 5.4 g/L.  Of the 16 patients with lymphadenopathy at baseline, the median 
decrease in lymphadenopathy (meas ured as median reduction in sum of product diameters) was 
38% (9% to 81%).  
The BGB -3111 -GA101 -001 study is an ongoing, open -label, multicenter, phase 1b study of the 
combination of zanubrutinib and obinutuzumab in patients with various B -cell malignancies.   As 
of 15 December 2016, 40  patients with CLL/SLL (17 patients with previously untreated disease; 
23 patients with relapsed/refractory disease), and 13 patients with relapsed or refractory 
follicular lymphoma were enrolled. The median follow -up time was 4 .1 months for CLL/SLL 
and 6.2  months for follicular lymphoma.  Zanubrutinib plus obinutuzumab was well tolerated.  
No fatal AEs occurred; only 1  AE led to treatment discontinuation (squamous cell carcinoma in a 
patient with prior squamous cell carcinoma).  SAEs were reported in 25.0% of the patients with 
CLL/SLL and 23.1% of the patients with follicular lymphoma; there was only 1 SAE related to 
obinutuzumab (infusion -related reaction) and 1 SAE related to zanubrutinib (pneumonia). There 
were no AEs of atria l fibrillation.  Patients were evaluable for response if they had completed 
baseline and ≥  1 on-treatment response assessment.  ORRs were 88.9% in previously untreated 
CLL/SLL, 86.7% in relapsed/refractory CLL/SLL, and 81.8% in relapsed/refractory follicul ar 
lymphoma, including 3 complete responses (CRs) in CLL/SLL and 5 CRs in follicular 
lymphoma.  Two patients experienced disease progression (1 with relapsed/refractory CLL, 1 
with relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma); no instances of disease transform ation occurred.  
For more detailed information on the clinical experience for zanubrutinib please refer to the 
Investigator Brochure ( BeiGene Investigator Brochure ). 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Safety Pharmacology  
The potential risk of zanubrutinib on QT interval prolongation was assessed using a battery of 
preclinical studies and a clinical thorough QT study (BGB -3111 -106).  A GLP -compliant hERG 
assay was conducted.  Based on the clinical steady -state, unbound C max of 0.042  μM (total  Cmax 
346 ng/mL; plasma protein binding 94.2%) observed at the recommended Phase  2 dose (RP2D) 
of 160  mg BID, there is more than a 200 -fold exposure margin compared with the hERG IC 50 of 
9.11 μM. 
No effects on blood pressure, heart rate, or electrocardiogr am (ECG) findings, including QT and 
QTc intervals, were noted in telemetry -instrumented conscious dogs following single doses of 
zanubrutinib up to 100  mg/kg.  In addition, no abnormal changes in ECG or cardiovascular 
Version .[ADDRESS_1000829] 2021  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 21 function were noted in 28 - and 91 -day repeat -dose toxicity studies in dogs at doses up to 
100 mg/kg.  In these studies, the systemic exposure of zanubrutinib was 10 -fold higher than that 
observed at the human therapeutic dose.  
The QT interval prolongation potential of zanubrutinib was evaluated in healthy subjects in a 
thorough QT study (BGB -3111 -106).  Results from this study demonstrated that single oral 
doses of zanubrutinib at a therapeutic dose of [ADDRESS_1000830] a clinically relevant effec t on ECG parameters, including QTc intervals and other ECG 
intervals.  Because of the short half -life and no accumulation seen upon multiple -dosing, these 
results are also applicable for steady -state conditions.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Clinical Pharmacology  
Results from a dedicat ed drug -drug interaction study (BGB -3111 -104) indicate that 
co-administration of zanubrutinib with the strong CYP3A inducer rifampin (600 mg once daily 
for 8 days) decreased exposure of zanubrutinib by 13.5 -fold for AUC 0-∞, and 12.6 -fold for C max, 
in healt hy subjects.  Co -administration of zanubrutinib with the strong CYP3A inhibitor 
itraconazole (200 mg once daily for 4 days) increased exposure of zanubrutinib by 3.8 -fold for 
AUC 0-∞, and 2.[ADDRESS_1000831] for zanubrutinib.   Administration of zanubrutinib with 
strong/moderate CYP3A inhibitors or CYP3A inducers (refer to  Appendix  [ADDRESS_1000832] of these 
medications) and grapefruit juice and Seville oranges should be done with caution, as they may 
affect the metabolism of zanubrutinib.  If at all possible, patients are encouraged not to use 
strong/moderate CYP3 A inhibitors and inducers and consider using alternative agents.  If these 
agents will be used, follow the dose modification table in  Appendix  8.  The medical monitor 
should be consulted in these situations.   
Zanubrutinib is a mild inducer of CYP3A4 and CYP2C19.  Narrow therapeutic index drugs that 
are metabolized by [CONTACT_097]3A4 (alfentanil, cyclosporine, dihydroergotamine, ergotamine, fentanyl, 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_3924], qu inidine, sirolimus and tacrolimus), and CYP2C19 (eg, S -mephenytoin) should be 
used with caution, as zanubrutinib may decrease the plasma exposures of these drugs.  Since 
blood levels and effectiveness of drugs that are substrates for CYP3A (eg, steroidal 
contraceptives) may be reduced by [CONTACT_097]3A inducers, if patients are using hormonal 
contraceptives such as birth control pi[INVESTIGATOR_5178], a second barrier method of contraception 
(eg, condoms) must  be used.  The coadministration of oral P -glycoprotein (P-gp) substrates with 
a narrow therapeutic index (eg, digoxin) should be used with caution as zanubrutinib may 
increase their concentrations.  
1.4. Benefit -Risk Assessment  
A pooled safety analysis of ongoing zanubrutinib clinical trials using a data cutoff of Septembe r 
[ADDRESS_1000833] common events.  The pooled analysis of z anubrutinib safety data shows atrial fibrillation 
was 1.7% and serious hemorrhage was 1.9%; both of these values are close to expected 
background rates.  Concomitant use of vitamin K antagonists was, and continues to be, allowed 
Version .[ADDRESS_1000834] 
been few instances of drug discontinuation for any adverse event ( Tam et al 2017 ).   
The current randomized Phase 2 study is based on results from a g lobal Phase 1b, open -label, 
multicenter study of the combination of zanubrutinib and obinutuzumab in patients with B -cell 
malignancies —specifically, CLL/SLL, WM, follicular lymphoma , mantle cell lymphoma , 
marginal zone lymphoma , and DLBCL.  The primary obj ectives in this study were to evaluate 
the safety and tolerability for the combination of zanubrutinib and obinutuzumab.  The first 
patient was dosed on 13 January 2016 and, as of the 16 September 2018 data cutoff, a total of 
119 patients had been treated on study.   Adverse events ≥ Grade 3, regardless of attribution by 
[CONTACT_093], included : neutropenia in 28 subjects (23.5%), fatigue in 1  (0.8%), 
thrombocytopenia in 9 (7.6%), pyrexia in 3 (2.5%), back pain in 3 (2.5%), constipation in 1 
(0.8%), pneum onia in 6 (5.0%) and urinary tract infection in 3 subjects (2.5%).  Seven subjects 
(5.9%) had an adverse event leading to treatment discontinuation.  No new safety signals or 
trends have been observed with the combination therapy of zanubrutinib and obinut uzumab.  
Given the safety summary profile for zanubrutinib, either as monotherapy or in combination with 
obinutuzumab, BeiGene believes that the benefit -risk balance remains favorable for research 
subjects.

3.1. Summary of Study Design  
This is an interna tional (approximately 100 sites), phase 2, open -label, randomized, 
active -control study of zanubrutinib plus obinutuzumab versus obinutuzumab monotherapy in 
210 patients with relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma.  The primary efficacy endpoint is 
ORR  determined by [CONTACT_69795].  Disease response will be assessed per the 
Lugano Classification for Non -Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL) ( Cheson et al 2014 ; 
Appendix  2) - hereafter referred to as Lugano Classification for NHL.  
Central randomization (2:1) will be used to assign patients to one of the following study drug 
treatments:  
Arm A : zanubrutinib plus obinutuzumab  
Arm B : obinutuzumab monotherapy  
Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_732531] (2 to 3 versus ˃  3), 
rituximab -refractory status (yes vs no), and geographic region (China vs ex -China).  
Rituximab -refractory is defined as follows: “Failure to respond to, or progression during, any 
previous rituximab -containing regimen (monotherapy or combined with chemotherapy), or 
progression within [ADDRESS_1000837] rituximab dose, in the induction or maintenance 
treatment settings. ”  Rituximab -containing regimen is defined as those with at least four weekly 
doses of rituximab if administered as monotherapy, or at least four cycles if given as 
chemoimmunotherapy.  For induction therapy regimens during which a patient had disease 
progression, the minimum necessary rituximab dose is one full cycle (monotherapy or 
chemoimmunotherapy) or one dose of 375 mg/m2 (maintenance).  A patient who has not 
received any prior rituximab will have a rituximab -refractory status of “NO” for stratificati on. 
Treatment with zanubrutinib plus obinutuzumab and treatment with obinutuzumab monotherapy 
will be open label.  Study treatment must commence within 5  days after randomization.   
Each cycle consists of 28 days.  Study drug treatments will be administere d as follows, 
depending on cohort and treatment assignment:  
• Zanubrutinib will be administered as two 80 -mg capsules by [CONTACT_326372] a day 
(160 mg twice a day) with or without food.  
• Obinutuzumab will be administered 1,000 mg intravenously on days 1, 8, and 1 5 of 
Cycle 1, then 1,000 mg on Day 1 of Cycles 2 to 6, then 1,000 mg every 8 weeks.  
(At the discretion of the investigator, obinutuzumab may be administered 100 mg on 
Day 1 and 900 mg on Day 2 of Cycle 1 instead of 1,000 mg on Day 1 of Cycle 1.)  
Respondi ng patients may continue to receive maintenance obinutuzumab every 
8 weeks for an additional 24 months (eg, maximum total duration of obinutuzumab of 
approximately 30 months  [maximum 20 doses ]). 
• At the discretion of the investigator, patients in arm B will  be eligible to receive 
crossover treatment with zanubrutinib plus obinutuzumab if they experience 
progressive disease or their disease does not respond to therapy with a CR or PR after

and response evaluation  assessments will continue to be performed per the Schedule 
of Assessments (Appendix  9). 
Study Assessments  
Assessments of follicular lymphoma status during the study include: disease -related 
constitutional symptoms, physical examination of lymph nodes, liver, and spleen, complete 
blood count (CBC), bone marrow examination, positron emission tomography (PET)/computed 
tomography (CT) scan with contrast of neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis, patient -reported 
outcomes (PROs; EQ -5D-5L and EORTC QLQ -C30 questionnaires).  
Tumor assessments,  including imaging studies, will be performed at screening, every [ADDRESS_1000839] -based 
assessments as follows:  
• PET-CT scans are required at screening, end of Cycles 3, 6, and 12, and to confirm a 
result on CT scan (CR/PR or disease progression)  
• CT scans with contrast are required at all other tumor response assessments  
Patients receiving zanubrutinib should remain on study treatment until disease progression is  
confirmed by [CONTACT_69795].  Patients receiving obinutuzumab should remain on 
study treatment until either disease progression is confirmed by [CONTACT_732543] 30 months of treatment with obinutuzumab  (maximum 20 do ses), whichever 
occurs first.  
Assessments of safety will include AEs, SAEs, clinical laboratory tests, physical examinations, 
and vital signs.  AEs will be graded for severity per the current version of National Cancer 
Institute Common Terminology Criteria  for Adverse Events (NCI -CTCAE).  An independent 
data monitoring committee (DMC) will periodically monitor safety data.  
Components of the Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index (FLIPI) score  
(Solal -Céligny et al  2004 ) at diagnosis and at screening will be collected: age, Ann Arbor stage, 
hemoglobin level, number of nodal areas (see  Appendix  3), and serum LDH level, in addition to 
the following components of FLIPI 2 ( Relander et al 2010 ): bone marrow involvement, nodes

3.3. Blinding  
Treatment with zanubrutinib and obinutuzumab will be open label, however, the assessment of 
overall response rate by [CONTACT_229145] t central review (primary endpoint) will be blinded.  
3.4. Duration of Study  
The total duration of this study is expected to be approximately 5 years, assuming an expected 
enrollment duration of 30 months and maximum duration of obinutuzumab of approximately 
30 months  (maximum 20  doses)  after the last enrolled patient.  Patients assigned to arm A 
(zanubrutinib plus obinutuzumab), who in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], continue to benefit 
from study treatment may continue treatment with zanubrutinib by [CONTACT_732544]; this is a rollover study for patients who wish to continue receiving 
zanubrutinib.  
3.5. Discussion of Study Design, Including Choice of Control Group  
The proposed study will be conducted in patients with histologi cally confirmed follicular 
lymphoma (Grade  1, 2, or 3a) who have received ≥  2 prior systemic treatments for follicular 
lymphoma; have received an anti -CD20 antibody, and an appropriate alkylator -based 
combination therapy (eg, rituximab, cyclophosphamide, d oxorubicin, and prednisolone ; 
rituximab, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisolone ; and/or bendamustine plus 
rituximab).  
The patient eligibility definition above is intended to define a patient population for whom new, 
effective treatments are needed.  While current expert guidelines specify the repeat use of 
chemoimmunotherapy for patients with a long (≥  24 months) remissio n to their prior therapy, 
acceptable options for patients with a short remission to prior therapy are quite limited.  
Additionally, many treatments are not applicable to patients with follicular lymphoma in later 
relapse due to age, non -lymphoma comorbidit y, limited bone marrow reserve due to prior 
cytotoxic therapy or stem cell transplantation, or radioimmunotherapy treatments 
Version .[ADDRESS_1000841] 2021  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 27 (National  Comprehensive Cancer Network 2017 ; Dreyling et al 2017 ).  For many patients with 
follicular lymphoma in later relapse, and particularly those with short response duration to prior 
therapy, this leaves anti -CD20 antibody therapy or idelalisib as palliative options.  
According to the Eu ropean Society for Medical Oncology Clinical Practice Guidelines for 
diagnosis, treatment and follow -up of newly diagnosed and relapsed follicular lymphoma 
(Dreyling et al 2017 ):  “the selection of salvage treatmen t depends on efficacy of prior 
regimens…obinutuzumab has recently received a positive recommendation for approval by [CONTACT_732545] -refractory cases based on an improved PFS in 
comparison with bendamustine only.”  In Europe, th e anti -CD20 agent, obinutuzumab 
(Gazyvaro®) has gained approval in the rituximab -refractory setting ( Gazyvaro Summary of 
Product Characteristics 2016 ), when added to bendamustine, based on demonstration of 
prolonging  PFS compared with bendamustine -alone in patients who were refractory to their prior 
rituximab -containing treatment ( Sehn et al 2016 ).  In the context of the proposed trial in the 
third -line and beyond setting, the use of obinut uzumab monotherapy as a comparator would be 
appropriate given the likelihood that prior bendamustine -based therapy will already have been 
administered or considered, and the ability to re -administer anti -CD20 monotherapy remains a 
palliative measure in the  majority of patients with relapsed or refractory disease.  Furthermore, 
the use of obinutuzumab rather than rituximab would allow for a direct measure of the 
contribution of obinutuzumab to the safety and activity of the novel combination regimen under 
investigation (zanubrutinib plus obinutuzumab).  
Obinutuzumab has also been evaluated as a single -agent in relapsed or refractory follicular 
lymphoma/indolent lymphoma.  In a randomized phase [ADDRESS_1000842] rituximab dose, obinutuzumab was associated 
with a higher response rate (45% versus 27%) compared with rituximab, but there was no 
difference in media n or 2 -year PFS ( Sehn et al 2015 ).  In a previous phase 1 study, 
obinutuzumab demonstrated a 23% ORR rate in 23 patients with relapsed or refractory indolent 
lymphoma, with a 15% response rate in a subset of 13 patients wit h rituximab -refractory disease, 
defined as progressive disease within 12 months of previous rituximab therapy ( Sehn et al 2012 ).  
In the phase 3 GALLIUM study in patients with previously untreated follicular lymphoma,  
obinutuzumab -chemotherapy induction followed by [CONTACT_732546] -chemotherapy induction followed by [CONTACT_732547] 
(Marcus et al 2016 ). 
The phosphoinositol -3-kinase inhibitor idelalisib (Zydelig®) was approved by [CONTACT_732548] 2 prior lines of treatment, based on results 
from a single -arm, multicenter clinical study conducted in 125 patients with indolent lympho ma 
(Zydelig Summary of Product Characteristics 2016 ).  The study population included 72 patients 
with follicular lymphoma.  All patients were refractory to rituximab, defined per protocol as less 
than a PR or disease progression within 6 months after completion of a prior therapy.  The ORR 
was 57% (54% in follicular lymphoma), with 6 patients (8%; all with follicular lymphoma) 
achieving a CR.  The median duration of response was 12.5 months.  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_732518], three phase 3 trials of idelalisib in indolent lymphoma, in 
combination with anti -CD20 agents or chemoimmunotherapy, were prematurely terminated due 
to an imbalance in infectious deaths in the idelalisib arms of the studies ( Zydelig FDA 
Version .[ADDRESS_1000843] 2021  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 28 Alerts  2016 ).  Thus, we believe that treatments capable of inducing a high rate of durable 
responses, with favorable safety profiles, in patients with follicular lymphoma or indolent 
lymphoma in second or greater relapse, are  still needed; particularly those patients who are now 
treatment -refractory or have a short remission duration with prior therapy.  
The patient population selected for this phase [ADDRESS_1000844] to the frequency of objective response, depth of response, lack of treatment failure due to 
progressive disease or toxicity, and tolerability/safety profile.  Though the incorporation of 
chemoimmunotherapy into the sequential treatment practice for follicular lymphoma has 
improved lymphoma -specific outcomes in this disease, follicular lymphoma re mains incurable, 
and the incorporation of cytotoxic agents into the treatment sequence for follicular lymphoma, 
particularly alkylating agents, can result in cumulative myelotoxicity, immunosuppression, and 
risk for secondary leukemia; therefore, it is rea sonable to evaluate regimens such as zanubrutinib 
plus obinutuzumab as potential alternatives to cytotoxic chemoimmunotherapy regimens.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 33 5. ENROLLMENT AND STUDY  PROCEDURES  
Study enrollment and procedures are summarized in the following subsections.  The timing of all 
study procedures is provi ded in the Schedule of Assessments (Appendix  9). 
Visit Windows  
A study visit may be scheduled on any day within a specified study week.  For any given day 
within the study week, the visit window is ±  7 days (ie, 7 days before or after the given day) 
unless otherwise stated.  Study drug supplies must be considered when  scheduling visits during 
windows.  Procedures for a given visit may be split across the window to allow for drug resupply 
and completion of study procedures.   
Informed Consent  
At the screening visit, study site personnel must explain to potential study participants all aspects 
of the study, including all scheduled visits and activities.  Study site personnel must obtain 
signed informed consent before any study -specific procedures are conducted (unless the 
procedures are part of routine standard of care),  and must document the informed consent 
process in the patient’s clinical record.  Informed consent may be obtained before the [ADDRESS_1000859] a documented result within the 
protocol -specified screening window.   
For patients who provide i nformed consent and subsequently do not meet eligibility criteria or 
withdraw consent before randomization, study site personnel should document the screen failure 
in the patient’s source documents.  The documentation should include demographics and medica l 
history, the reason for screen failure, the eligibility criteria reviewed, procedures performed, etc.   
5.1. Enrollment and Randomization  
All screening procedures must be performed up to [ADDRESS_1000860] administration of 
study drug, unless noted othe rwise; assessments not completed within this interval must be 
repeated.  The site investigator is responsible for maintaining a record of all patients screened 
and those who are enrolled in the study.  
Patient Numbering  
After obtaining informed consent, stu dy site personnel will access the Interactive Response 
Technology (IRT) system to assign a unique patient number to a potential study participant.  
Patient numbers will be assigned in chronological order starting with the lowest number.  Once a 
patient num ber has been assigned to a patient, it cannot be reassigned to any other patient.  
Medical and Cancer History  
Review any medical and cancer history any time after obtaining informed consent; includes 
presence or absence of disease -related constitutional sy mptoms.  Clinically significant medical 
history findings (ie, previous diagnoses, diseases or surgeries) not pertaining to the study 
indication, started before signing the informed consent, and considered relevant for the patient’s 
Version .[ADDRESS_1000861] 2021  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 34 study eligibility will b e collected and captured in the electronic case report form (eCRF).  
Clinically significant is defined as any events, diagnoses or laboratory values requiring 
treatment, follow -up or the presence of signs or symptoms that require medical intervention.  
Concurrent medical signs and symptoms must be documented to establish baseline severities.  
Other background information to be collected includes: history of disease (including the date of 
initial diagnosis and current disease status), staging, sites of diseas e, and presence or absence of 
disease -related constitutional symptoms.  Prior medications/significant non -drug therapi[INVESTIGATOR_69775] (gender, date of birth [or age] and race/ethnicity) will also be collected.  
Components of the Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index (FLIPI) score  
(Solal -Céligny et al 2004 ) at diagnosis and at screening will be collected: age, Ann Arbor stage, 
hemoglobin level, number of nodal areas (see  Appendix  3), and serum LDH level, in addition to 
the following components of FLIPI 2 ( Relander et al 2010 ): bone marrow involvement, nodes 
> [ADDRESS_1000862] be met and none of the exclusion criteria may apply.  No eligibility 
waivers will be granted.   
After a patient is screened and the investigator determines the patient is eligible for 
randomization, study site personnel will complete an Eligibility  Authorization Packet and email 
it to the medical monitor or designee to approve the enrollment in writing.  Study site personnel 
should ensure that a medical monitor -approved Eligibility Packet is in the patient’s file before 
proceeding with study procedu res.  
The archival tissue sample used for follicular lymphoma diagnosis or the associated pathology 
report from diagnosis will be sent to the central pathology laboratory for confirmation of tissue 
diagnosis.  It is not required that the archival tissue sa mple or pathology report be sent before 
randomization/treatment assignment, but documentation must be provided as part of the 
eligibility package.  
Enrollment/Randomization  
Access the IRT system to assign study drugs.  This may occur up to [ADDRESS_1000863] 2021  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 35 5.3. Zanubrutinib Dispensation  
Zanubrutinib will be dispensed by [CONTACT_732550].  Ins tructions are to be provided for dosing, storage, and the 
return of all bottles (used and unused) at future visits.  
5.4. Pharmacokinetics  
Blood samples to assess plasma zanubrutinib concentrations will be collected in patients in arm 
A.  Sparse PK samples will be collected from patients randomized to arm A (zanubrutinib plus 
obinutuzumab) at the following time points: predose (within 30 min prior to zanubrutinib dose), 
and 2 hours (± 30 min) post zanubrutinib dose on Cycle [ADDRESS_1000864] occur under the supervision of the investigator (or 
designee) after the predose PK sample is obtained.  The actual time (to the n earest minute) of 
zanubrutinib administration on the day prior to Cycle [ADDRESS_1000865] be 
recorded on the eCRF.  Should a drug-drug interaction  between zanubrutinib and a concomitant 
medication be suspected, further blood samples for PK ana lyses may be taken to characterize the 
extent of the interaction.  
Blood samples (2 mL) for PK analysis will be collected into EDTA collection tubes.  Details 
concerning handling of the PK plasma samples, including labeling and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_732519].  PK samples will only be collected from sites 
that are able to adequately follow the sampling, handling and processing procedures outlined in 
the laboratory manual.  
Samples will be shipped to the designate d bioanalytical lab for quantification of plasma 
zanubrutinib concentrations using a validated method.  
5.5. Safety Assessments  
Physical Examination and Vital Signs  
Physical examination, vital signs (sitting blood pressure, heart rate, and body temperature), and 
weight will be performed at each study visit.  Height (cm) is determined at screening only.   
A complete physical exam includes an assessment of systems per s tandard of care at the study 
site and as clinically indicated by [CONTACT_23805].  
Assessment of vital signs and a focused physical examination on Cycle [ADDRESS_1000866] AEs that occurred during screening on the medical history case report form and in the 
patient’s clinical record.  
Collect non -serious AE information fr om the time of first dose of study drug through safety 
follow -up.  Information on all SAEs (regardless of relatedness) will be collected from the time of 
signed informed consent through screen failure or safety follow -up.  The AE reporting period is 
define d in Section 8.4.1 . 
All treatment -related AEs and SAEs will be followed until resolution or stabilization.  The 
accepted regulatory definition for a n AE is provided in Section 8.1.1 .  Important additional 
requirements for reporting SAEs are explained in Section 8.4.2 .  
5.6. Efficacy Assessments  
Response will be assessed by [CONTACT_732551] ( Cheson et al 2014 ).  The primary endpoint will be ORR based on 
independent central review.  Investigators will assess response without knowledge of 
independent central review results.  Response parameters will include assessment of 
lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly and splenom egaly, blood lymphocyte count, bone marrow 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337]/biopsy, platelet count, hemoglobin level, and neutrophil count.  In the event of a 
treatment delay, disease assessments are to continue per the Schedule of Assessments 
(Appendix  9). 
For patients receiving zanubrutinib, refer to  Appendix  2 regarding the assessment of disease 
progression during study drug holds.  
Disease -Related Constitutional Symptoms  
Disease -related constitutional symptoms (or B -symptoms) (unexplained fever of ≥  101°F 
[or 38.3°C], drenching night sweats; or unexplained loss of >  10% body weight within the 
previous 6 months) will be evaluated at screening, every [ADDRESS_1000867] baseline  (within 35 days of randomization) PET/CT scan with contrast of 
neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis and any other disease sites.  
Patients with suspected transformation of disease (eg, a PET/CT with high standardized uptake 
value -avidity or new onset symptoms)  should be fully evaluated prior to enrollment on study.   
Version .[ADDRESS_1000868] -enhanced PET/CT 
or contrast -enhanced CT only.  Patients with disease that is FDG -avid by [CONTACT_732552]/CT.  
Ideally, and depending on the imaging equipment available, contrast -enhanced CT should occur 
combined with PET on a single visit. Combined PET/CT may be used in lieu of a CT with 
contrast only if the CT of  the combined PET/CT has been performed with diagnostic quality and 
contrast is administered.   
PET/CT scans are required at screening and after Cycles 3, 6, and 12.  A PET/CT scan is 
required to confirm a result on CT scan (CR/PR or disease progression) . 
CT with contrast will be performed at all other tumor assessment timepoints ( see Appendix  9, 
Schedule of Assessments).  
For patients with a contraindicati on to receiving CT scan IV -contrast  (eg, contrast allergy, or 
other medical contraindication such as renal insufficiency ), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 
may be used in place of CT scans.  For patients being assessed via MRI, a non -contrast chest CT 
scan is acceptable, and preferred, in place of a chest MRI to evaluate the lung parenchyma.  The 
same imaging technique (ie , CT, MRI) should  be used consistently throughout a patient’s time 
on the study .  All efforts will be made to ensure that the imaging equ ipment, contrast agent, and 
person (investigator or radiologist) performing the evaluation is kept constant throughout a 
patient’s remaining course on study.  
All PET/CT scans, CT scans, and MRIs obtained during the study will be collected and reviewed 
by a central imaging vendor identified to this trial.  De -identified copi[INVESTIGATOR_732520] (including those from screening) must be provided to the sponsor or designee 
(eg, central imaging vendor).  
Modification from Lugano Classification for NHL  (Cheson et al 2014 ): 
Pseudoprogression  is defined as an objective tumor response occurring after initial 
documentation of  apparent  radiological progressive disease  and has been observed in patients 
receiving a B TK inhibitor for treatment of follicular lymphoma  (Salles et al 2016 ).  For patients 
in either arm, a timepoint finding of “disease progression” will require a confirmatory scan at 
least 4  weeks after the scan that in itially demonstrated possible progression.  An exception to the 
confirmatory scan requirement exists if one or more of the following clear, clinical signs of 
progression is present and the investigator believes the progression is unequivocal:  
a. Clinical symp toms and signs of disease progression (including worsening laboratory 
values)  
b. Deterioration of  ECOG performance status  
c. Rapid progression of disease or of progressive tumor at critical anatomical sites 
(eg, cord compression) that necessitates urgent medical intervention.  
Note: If any of the conditions above are present, no  confirmatory scan is required to confirm the 
disease progression . 
Due to the potential for pseudoprogression cases in this study, patient s in both Arms A and B 
should remain on study treatment while the patient waits for the confirmation scan  results . 
Version .[ADDRESS_1000869] 2021  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 38 Bone Marrow Examination  
Bone marrow biopsy is required under the following conditions during the treatment period: 
during screening to assess  bone marrow involvement of lymphoma; and if clinical and laboratory 
results demonstrate that a CR has been achieved, in order to confirm a CR – only applicable to 
patients whose bone marrow was positive for lymphoma involvement at screening.   
Bone marrow  biopsies will be reviewed by [CONTACT_732553].  In addition, all of the bone marrow samples from screening to end of study will be 
collected to be reviewed by a pathologist from central pathology laboratory.  
5.7. Patien t-Reported Outcomes  
PROs will continue to be assessed until disease progression, death, or withdrawal of consent, 
regardless of study treatment discontinuation.  Patients should complete the EQ -5D-5L and 
EORTC QLQ -C30 questionnaires per the Schedule of Ass essments (Appendix  9) before study 
drug is administered, and when possible before performing any other procedures.   No PRO 
questionnaires are required duri ng crossover treatment.   
EQ-5D-5L 
The EQ -5D-5L is a standardized instrument for use as a measure of health outcome ( EuroQol 
Group 1990 ; Herdman et al, 2011 ).  Patients will  self-rate their current state of mobility, 
self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression by [CONTACT_43435] [ADDRESS_1000870] the level of severity (no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, 
severe problems, or e xtreme problems) within each dimension.  The questionnaire also includes 
a visual analog scale to self -rate general health state on a scale from “the worst health you can 
imagine” to “the best health you can imagine.”  A sample questionnaire is provided in  
Appendix  6 as an example only.  
EORTC QLQ -C30 
The EORTC QLQ -C30 is a questionnaire developed to assess the quality of life of cancer 
patients.  It is a copyrighted instrument, which has been translated and validated in over 
100 languages and is used in more than 3,000 studies worldwide.  The EORTC QLQ -C30 
includes 30 separate questions (items) resulting in 5  functional scales (Physical Functioning, 
Role  Functioning, Emotional Functioning, Cognitive Functioning, and Social Functioning), 
1 Global Health Status scale, 3 symptom scales (Fatigue, Nausea and Vomiting, and Pain), and 
6 single items (Dyspnea, Insomnia, Appetite Loss, Constipation, Diarrhea, and Financial 
Difficulties) ( Fayers et al, 2001 ).  The recall period is 1 week (the past week).  The EORTC 
QLQ -C30 has been widely used among cancer patients in general, and specifically in 
non-Hodgkin lymphoma patients.   It is a reliable and valid measure of PRO in cancer patients 
and takes about [ADDRESS_1000871] tubes and labels is provided in the 
laboratory manual.  
Chemistry, CBC with differential, coagulation, serum immunoglobulin, and β 2-microglobulin, 
will be performed at the timepoints specified in the Schedule of Assessment (Appendix  9), and 
may also be performed as medically necessary.  On Cycle [ADDRESS_1000872] study drug administration do not need to be repeated on Cycle 1 Day 
1.   
Hematology  
CBC with differential is required to be performed at every visit during the treatment phase and 
during safety f ollow -up and long -term follow -up.  CBC includes hemoglobin, hematocrit, 
platelet count, red blood cell count, white blood cell count with differential including neutrophils 
(including bands), lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils.  
Chemistry  
Serum chemistry includes sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, glucose, blood urea 
nitrogen, creatinine, calcium, phosphate/phosphorus, magnesium, total bilirubin, total protein, 
albumin, ALT, AST, lactate dehydrogenase, and alkaline phosphatase.    
Serum Immunoglobulins  
Quantitative serum immunoglobulins (IgG, IgM, IgA) will be measured at screening ; on Day  1 
of Cycle 3, Cycle  6, Cycle  9, and Cycle  12; and  then every 24 week s thereafter until disease 
progression .    
Coagulation  
The coagulation profile includes prothrombin time , which will also be reported as international 
normalized ratio , and activated partial thromboplastin time.  The coagulation profile will be 
performed at screening only.   
Hepatitis B and C testing  
Hepatitis B/C serologic markers a nd/or viral load will be tested at screening.  The hepatitis B 
testing includes HBsAg, HBcAb, and hepatitis B surface antibody  (HBsAb ) as well as HBV 
DNA by [CONTACT_732554], but HBcAb positive (regardless of HBsAb 
status).  The hep atitis C testing includes HCV antibody as well as HCV RNA by [CONTACT_732555].  Patients with positive HBsAg and/or detectable level of HBV 
DNA or detectable level of HCV RNA are not eligible.   
Patients who are HBsAg -negative, H BcAb -positive and HBV DNA -negative must undergo at 
least monthly HBV DNA screening by [CONTACT_954]. These patients should be considered for 
prophylactic antiviral treatment in consultation with a local HBV expert. If, during monthly

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 40 monitoring of HBV DNA by [CONTACT_954], th e value is between 20 IU/mL and 100 IU/mL, then the 
HBV DNA level should be rechecked within 2 weeks.  Study drug should be stopped and 
antiviral therapy initiated if the repeat level is between 20  IU/mL and 100  IU/mL.  If the HBV 
DNA by [CONTACT_732556] 100  IU/mL o r higher, then study drug should be stopped and antiviral therapy 
initiated or continued.  Resumption of study drug in patients whose HBV reactivation resolves 
should be discussed with, and approved by, physicians with expertise in managing hepatitis B.  
Patients positive for HCV antibody, but negative for HCV RNA, must undergo monthly HCV 
RNA screening.  Patients with HCV RNA of 15 IU/mL or greater should stop study drug and 
antiviral therapy should be initiated.  Resumption of study drug in patients whose HCV 
reactivation resolves should be discussed with, and approved by, physicians with expertise in 
managing hepatitis C.  
The medical monitor should be informed of any suspected hepatitis B or hepatitis C reactivation.   
Table  1 below, shows how the results for, HBV/HCV, and HBV/HCV testing at screening relate 
to inclusion and exclusion criteria .

Pregnancy Test  
A serum pregnancy test will be performed at screening, within 7 days of randomization, and at 
the end of treatment in women of childbearing po tential.   During treatment, l aboratory -based , 
highly -sensitive pregnancy tests (urine or serum) will be performed within [ADDRESS_1000874] dose of study

is positive, it must be confirmed by a serum pregnancy test.  A patient who  has a positive 
Version .[ADDRESS_1000875] result at any time after the study drug administration will be immediately 
withdrawn from treatment in the study.  
5.9. Unscheduled Visits  
Unscheduled visits may be performed at any time at the patient’s or investigator’s request a nd 
may include vital signs/focused physical examination; ECOG performance status; AE review; 
concomitant medications and procedures review; radiographic assessments; physical 
examination of liver, spleen, and lymph nodes; disease -related constitutional sym ptoms; 
hematology and chemistry laboratory assessments ; serum immunoglobulins ; and pregnancy tests .  
The date and reason for the unscheduled visit must be recorded in the source documentation.   
If an unscheduled visit is necessary to assess toxicity or fo r suspected disease progression, then 
diagnostic tests may be performed based on investigator assessment as appropriate, and the 
results of these tests should be entered on the unscheduled visit eCRF.  
5.10. Arm B “Crossover” Treatment Adding Zanubrutinib  
At inve stigator discretion, and with medical monitor approval, patients in Arm B may 
“crossover” to add zanubrutinib following disease progression confirmed by [CONTACT_69796].  To initiate crossover therapy with zanubrutinib, a patient must meet the s afety and 
laboratory test requirements documented below.  Once approved for crossover, these patients 
will continue to follow the required safety and laboratory procedures in the Schedule of 
Assessments (Appendix  9) while receiving zanubrutinib and obinutuzumab.  No sparse PK 
samples or PRO questionnaires are required during crossover treatment.  The total duration of 
obinutuzumab treatment (ie, total of m onotherapy plus combination therapy) will be 
approximately 30 months  (maximum 20 doses) .  Following completion of [ADDRESS_1000876] be 
provided showing that the patient meets the following requirements within 15 days before date of 
submission of the form:  
• ANC  ≥ 1000/mm3, except when neutropenia is assessed by [CONTACT_732557], in which case ANC must be ≥  750/mm3 
• Platelet  > 50,000/mm3 (without growth factor support or transfusion within 7  days)  
• Creatinine clearance ≥  30 mL/min (as estimated by [CONTACT_16424] -Gault or MDRD 
equation or as measured  by [CONTACT_69817] 24‑hour urine collection)  
• AST/serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase, and (ALT)/serum glutamic pyruvic 
transaminase ≤  3.[ADDRESS_1000877]  
• Serum total bilirubin <  2.[ADDRESS_1000878] (unless documented Gilbert’s syndrome)  
• No known [LOCATION_001] Heart Association Class III or IV congestive heart failure 
(see Appendix  4) 
Version .[ADDRESS_1000879] 2021  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 42 • QTcF  ≤ 480 milliseconds based on Fridericia’s formula  
The investigator will confirm that the above crossover requirements are met and that the patient 
qualifies to add full dose zanubrutinib at [ADDRESS_1000880] crossover visit should include 
educ ation about the combination therapy and the dose, route , and frequency of zanubrutinib 
administration ; the patient should initiate zanubrutinib therapy on the date of the first crossover 
visit.  
5.11. End of Treatment Period  
The treatment period starts with the f irst day of assigned study treatment and includes ongoing 
assessments for safety and efficacy per the Schedule of Assessments following completion of 
protocol -specified treatment.  The treatment period ends on the first day of next -line therapy or 
on the d ay of confirmed disease progression, whichever occurs first.  
Patients may discontinue study drug for any one of the following reasons:  
• Disease progression  
• Any intolerable adverse event that cannot be improved with standard medical 
intervention or would lea d to undue risk to the patient  
• Patient withdrew consent  
• Patient pregnancy  
• Investigator decision  
• Other  
Patients may voluntarily withdraw consent from treatment at any time.   
5.12. Safety Follow -Up 
All patients who permanently discontinue zanubrutinib  will hav e a safety follow -up visit 
30 (± 7) days after the last dose of study drug to collect AEs, including AEs that may have 
occurred or been ongoing after the patient discontinued study treatment.  For the obinutuzumab 
monotherapy arm (Arm B), the safety follow -up visit will occur [ADDRESS_1000881] dose of 
study drug.  The investigator or his/her designee will also continue to collect information on new 
anticancer therapy given after the last dose of study drug.  A laboratory assessment is only 
required if the patient had an ongoing laboratory abnormality at the previous visit that the 
investigator considered to be related to study drug.  If the patient is unable to return to the clinic 
and no laboratory assessment is necessary, the investigator or his/her d esignee will contact [CONTACT_244454] .[ADDRESS_1000882] this information.  Refer to the Schedule of Assessments  
(Appendix  9) for the assessments to be performed at the safety follow -up visit.   
5.13. Long -Term Follow -Up 
All patients who discontinue study drug treatment will remain in the study, complete safety 
follow -up, and subsequently commence long -term follow -up, which includes m onitoring 
survival status and subsequent therapi[INVESTIGATOR_732521], and which may also include 
imaging and tumor response assessments for patients who have not yet had confirmed 
radiographic progression.  Visits repeat every 12 weeks (±  14 days)  until study end .  For patients 
who permanently discontinue study drug treatment before radiographic progression is 
documented and confirmed by [CONTACT_69795], tumor assessments (including 
radiographic imaging) will continue until radiographic pro gression is identified and confirmed 
by [CONTACT_732558] -line therapy, whichever comes first .  Patients with 
centrally confirmed disease progression  will be  followed up only for survival status and 
information about their next-line therapy.  
If the patient refuses to return for these visits or is unable to do so, every effort should be made 
to contact [CONTACT_732559]’s guardian by [CONTACT_69834]’s disease status and 
survival.  
5.14. End of Study  
Reasons for complete w ithdrawal from the study (including treatment and all follow -up visits) 
will occur under the following circumstances:  
• Patient withdrew consent  
• Death  
• Study termination by [CONTACT_3211]  
• Other  
Patients may voluntarily withdraw consent from the study at any time.  
5.15. Lost to Follow -Up 
Every reasonable effort should be made to contact [CONTACT_732560], record outstanding data, and retrieve study drug.   
Following unsuccessful telephone contac t, an effort to contact [CONTACT_69839] a method 
that provides proof of receipt should be attempted.  Alternate contacts are permissible if the 
patient is not reachable (eg, primary care providers, referring physician, relatives).  Such efforts 
should be documented in the patient’s source documents.   
If all efforts fail to establish contact, the patient will be considered lost to follow up.

6.1. Study Treatment Preparation and Dispensation  
6.1.1.  Packaging and Labeling  
Zanubrutinib capsules  will be provided in a child -resistant high -density polyethylene bottle with 
an induction seal and bottle label.  Obinutuzumab will be provided in vials containing solution 
for infusion.   
The contents of the label will be in accordance with all applicable  local regulatory requirements.  
6.1.2.  Handling and Storage  
The IRT system will be used for drug supply management.  The study drugs will be dispatched 
to a study center only after receipt of the required documents in accordance with applicable 
regulatory require ments and the sponsor’s procedures.  The investigator or 
pharmacist/designated personnel is responsible for maintaining the drug supply inventory and 
acknowledgment receipt of all study drug shipments.  All study drugs must be stored in a secure 
area with access limited to the investigator and authorized study center personnel and under 
physical conditions that are consistent with study drug -specific requirements.  The study drugs 
must be kept at the temperature condition as  specified on the labels.  
Zanubr utinib bottles must be stored at room temperature 15ºC to 30ºC.  
Obinutuzumab must be stored at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F), protected from light and should not 
be frozen or shaken.  For the diluted product, chemical and physical stability have been 
demonstr ated in 0.9% NaCl at concentrations of 0.4 mg/mL to 20 mg/mL for 24 hours at 2 °C to 
8°C (36 °F to 46 °F) followed by 48 hours (including infusion time) at room temperature 
(≤ 30°C/86 °F).  The solution for infusion should be used immediately.  If not used imm ediately, 
the prepared solution may be stored up to 24 hours at 2 °C to 8°C.   
Study drugs must be dispensed or administered according to procedures described herein.  Only 
patients enrolled in the study may receive study drug(s), in accordance with all app licable 
regulatory requirements.  Only authorized study center personnel may supply or administer study 
drug(s).   
6.1.3.  Compliance and Accountability  
Compliance will be assessed by [CONTACT_1755]/or study personnel at each patient visit and 
information pr ovided by [CONTACT_5363]/or guardian.  
The investigator and/or study personnel will keep accurate records of the quantities of study drug 
dispensed and used by [CONTACT_6904].  This information must be captured in the source document 
at each patient visit.  The investigator is responsible for study drug accountability, reconciliation, 
and record maintenance.  In accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the 
investigator or designated study center personnel must maintain study drug accountabilit y 
records throughout the course of the study.  This person will document the amount of study drug 
received from the sponsor, the amount supplied, and/or administered to and returned by [CONTACT_1962], 
if applicable.  
Version .[ADDRESS_1000884] be recorded on the appropriate eCRF.  
Zanubrutinib will be administered as two 80 -mg capsules by [CONTACT_326372] a day (160 mg twice a 
day) with or without food.  Patients will take zanubrutinib with water at approximately the same 
time every day, with a minimum of 8 hours between consecutive doses.  Zanubrutinib capsules 
should not be opened, broken, or chewed at any time.  
Patients receiving zanubrutinib should be instructed that if a dose of the study drug is not taken 
at the scheduled time, they should skip the study drug if the time to next dose is 8 hours or less, 
and return to normal dosing with next  dose.  If a patient vomits after taking the zanubrutinib 
capsules, that dose should not be repeated.  
On the days of PK blood sampling, study drug administration for patients assigned to arm A 
(zanubrutinib plus obinutuzumab) will occur at the center after  the predose blood sampling has 
occurred under the supervision of the investigator or his/her designee.  The investigator or 
his/her designee must instruct the patient not to self -administer the study drug prior to the office 
visit on those days.   
6.2.2.  Obinutu zumab  
Patients will receive obinutuzumab 1,000 mg intravenously on days 1, 8, and 15 of Cycle 1, then 
1,000  mg on Day 1 of Cycles 2 to 6, then 1,000  mg every 8 weeks.  (At the discretion of the 
investigator, obinutuzumab may be administered 100 mg on Day 1 and 900 mg on Day 2 of 
Cycle 1 instead of 1,000 mg on Day 1 of Cycle 1.)  Responding patients may continue to receive 
maintenance obinutuzumab every 8  weeks for an additional 24 months (eg, maximum total 
duration of obinutuzumab of approximately 30 months  [maximum 20 doses] ). 
Obinutuzumab should be administered at a rate of 50 mg/hr.  The rate of the infusion can be 
escalated in 50  mg/hr increments every 30 minutes to a maximum of 400 mg/hr.  If no infusion 
reaction occurs during the Cycle 1 Day 1 infusion and the final infusion rate was 100 mg/hr or 
faster, infusions can be started at a rate of 100  mg/hr and increased in 100 mg/hr increments 
every 30 minutes to a maximum of 400 mg/hr for all subsequent doses.  Patients should be

6.4. Precautions  
6.4.1.  Surgery and Procedures  
Susceptibility to bleeding has been observed with BTK inhibitors.  Study treatment with 
zanubrutinib should be held for 3 to 7 days before and after surgery, depending upon the type o f 
surgery and the risk of bleeding.  Obinutuzumab should also be interrupted, if applicable.   
6.5. Dose Interruption and Modification  
The guidelines set forth in Table  2 should be followed for dose interruption or modification of 
zanubrutinib for hematologic (Section 6.5.1 ) or nonhematologic (Section 6.5.2 ) toxicities .  No 
dose modifications for obinutuzumab are allowed.  
Temporary drug holds may cause short term worsening of disease.  Please review note at the end 
of Appendix  2 when assessing disease after a drug hold.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 47 6.5.1.  Zanubrutinib Dose Reductions for Hematologic Toxicity  
Dosing will be held for individual patients under any of the following conditions, based on 
investigator assessment of study drug relatedness:  
• Grade 4 neutropenia (lasting > 10 days)  
• Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (lasting > 10 days)  
• Grade 3 thrombocytopenia associated with significant bleeding  
• ≥ Grade [ADDRESS_1000888] occurrence of hematologic toxicity, treatment may restart at full dose upon recovery 
of the toxicity to ≤ Grade 1 or baseline.   
If the same event reoccurs, subjects will restart at one dose level lower upon recovery of the 
toxicity to ≤  Grad e 1 or baseline.  
A maximum of 2 dose reductions will be allowed.  
Subjects with Grade ≥ 3 thrombocytopenia associated with significant bleeding requiring 
medical intervention should be discussed with the medical monitor.  
6.5.2.  Zanubrutinib Dose Reductions for N onhematologic Toxicity  
For nonhematological toxicities ≥ Grade 3 (other than atrial fibrillation, or hypertension 
adequately controlled with oral medication) or asymptomatic laboratory events (laboratory 
events indicating liver or renal dysfunction will no t be considered asymptomatic laboratory 
events), suspected to be related to study drug treatment, study drug will be held until recovery to 
≤ Grade 1, and then restarted a t original dose level.  If the event recurs at ≥ Grade 3, drug will be 
held until rec overy to ≤ Grade 1 and restarted at level -2.  If the event recurs at ≥ Grade 3 at level 
-2, the patient will be discontinued from study treatment.   
For patients experiencing atrial fibrillation that is symptomatic and/or incompletely controlled: 
after th e atrial fibrillation is adequately controlled study drug may be restarted at either the 
original dose or dose level -1, per discretion of the treating investigator.  
Zanubrutinib should be permanently discontinued for any intracranial hemorrhage.  
For infor mation on study drug holds based on the results of hepatitis B or hepatitis C testing, see 
Section 5.8. 
6.5.3.  Dose Interruptions and Modifications for Obi nutuzumab  
There are no dose modifications of obinutuzumab.  
Obinutuzumab can cause severe and life -threatening infusion reactions.  Stop obinutuzumab 
infusion immediately and permanently discontinue for Grade 4 infusion reactions.  Interrupt 
obinutuzumab in fusion and manage symptoms for Grade 3 infusion reactions; upon resolution of 
symptoms, consider restarting obinutuzumab infusion at no more than half the previous rate 
(the rate being used at the time that the infusion reaction occurred) and, if the patie nt does not 
experience any further infusion reaction symptoms, the infusion rate escalation may resume at 
the increments and intervals as appropriate for the treatment cycle dose.  Permanently

7.1. Prior Therapy  
Medications taken within 4 weeks before randomization and any medications prescribed for 
chronic or intermittent use during the study, or dose adjustments of these medications, will be 
recorded on the eCRF and in the patient’s source documents.  
All prior therapi[INVESTIGATOR_732521], including immunochemotherapy, chemotherapy, 
transplant, targeted therapy, radiation therapy, etc. will be recorded on the eCRF wit h the dates 
of administration.  
Per the study eligibility criteria, patients who received prior certain medications and therapi[INVESTIGATOR_732522] (including allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation within 
12 months of study enrollment and prior exposure to a BTK inhibitor) are excluded from study 
participation.   
7.2. Concomitant Therapy  
All concomitant medications taken during the study will be recorded in the eCRF with 
indication, dose information, and dates of administration.   
Patients with high tumor burden should be monitored closely and prophylactic measures, 
including allopurinol or rasburicase, may be instituted per institutional standards.  
Prophylactic measures against infection, for the prevention of bacterial or fungal infections 
and/or for the prevention of hepatitis B infection reactivation, may be used per institutional 
standards.  
Patients with hematologic malignancies, particularly those having received prior 
lymphodepleting chemotherapy or having prolonged corticosteroid exposure,  are pre -disposed to 
opportunistic infections as a result of disease and treatment -related factors. In patients with a 
high risk for opportunistic infections, including Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP), 
prophylaxis should be considered as per institu tional standards.  
7.2.1.  Permitted Medications  
The following treatments are allowed:   
• Blood transfusions and growth factor support per standard of care and institutional 
guidelines  
• Corticosteroids for non -follicular lymphoma indications  
Patients should not receive treatment with systemic corticosteroids other than 
intermittently to control or prevent infusion reactions, or for short durations 
(< 2 weeks) to treat non -follicular lymphoma -related conditions (eg, to treat a flare of 
chronic obstructive pulmonar y disease), or at doses less than 20 mg/day of prednisone 
or prednisone -equivalent given daily to treat non -follicular lymphoma -related 
conditions

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 50 • Therapy to reduce symptoms of disease per standard of care and institutional 
guidelines  
Tumor lysis syndrome has not been currently reported with zanubrutinib treatment, but has been 
reported rarely with obinutuzumab.  Patients with high tumor burden should be monitored 
closely and prophylactic measures, including allopurinol, may be instituted per institutional 
standards.   
7.2.2.  Prohibited Medications  
Patients should not receive other anticancer therapy (cytotoxic, biologic, or immunotherapy) 
while on treatment in this study.  Other anticancer therapy should not be administered until 
disease progression (as per clinic al practice standards at the study center), unmanageable 
toxicity, or no further clinical benefit occurs which requires permanent discontinuation of the 
study drug.   
7.3. Potential Interactions Between the Study Drugs and Concomitant 
Medications  
7.3.1.  CYP -Inhibiting /Inducing Drugs  
When administering zanubrutinib, caution should be used with the any of the following, because 
they may affect the metabolism of zanubrutinib:  
• Strong/moderate CYP3A inhibitors  
• CYP3A inducers  
• Grapefruit juice  
• Seville oranges  
If at all possib le, patients are encouraged not to use strong/moderate CYP3A inhibitors and 
inducers and consider using alternative agents.  However, if CYP3A inhibitors or inducers will 
be used , follow the dose modification table in  Appendix  8.  The medical monitor should be 
consulted in these situations. Please refer to http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/main -table/  
for a more complete list.  
A clinical drug -drug interaction s tudy indicated that zanubrutinib is a mild inducer of CYP3A4 
and CYP2C19 .  Narrow therapeutic index drugs that are metabolized by [CONTACT_097]3A4 (alfentanil, 
cyclosporine, dihydroergotamine, ergotamine, fentanyl, pi[INVESTIGATOR_3924], quinidine, sirolimus and 
tacrolimus), and  CYP2C19 (eg, S -mephenytoin) should be used with caution, as zanubrutinib 
may decrease the plasma exposures of these drugs.  Since blood levels and effectiveness of drugs 
that are substrates for CYP3A (eg, steroidal contraceptives) may be reduced by [CONTACT_097]3A inducers, 
if patients are using hormonal contraceptives such as birth control pi[INVESTIGATOR_5178], a second 
barrier method of contraception (eg, condoms) must  be used.   The coadministration of oral P -gp 
substrates with a narrow therapeutic index (eg, digoxin)  should be used with caution as 
zanubrutinib may increase their concentrations.  
No formal drug interaction studies have been conducted with obinutuzumab (GAZYVA package 
insert).  
Version .[ADDRESS_1000892] ion and documentation of events meeting the criteria 
and definition of an AE or SAE as provided in this protocol.   
8.1. Adverse Events  
8.1.1.  Definitions and Reporting  
An AE is defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding),  symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a study 
drug, whether considered related to study drug or not.  
Examples of an AE include:  
• Worsening of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition including an increase in  
severity, frequency, duration, and/or has an association with a significantly worse 
outcome  
• New conditions detected or diagnosed after study drug administration even though it 
may have been present before the start of the study  
• Signs, symptoms, or the cli nical sequelae of a suspected interaction  
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study drug 
or a concurrent medication (overdose per se should not be reported as an AE or SAE)  
When an AE or SAE occurs, it is the respons ibility of the investigator to review all 
documentation (eg, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1088], laboratory results and diagnostics reports) relative to 
the AE or SAE.  The investigator will then record all relevant information regarding an AE or 
SAE in the eCRF.  Ho wever, there may be instances when copi[INVESTIGATOR_69780].  In these instances, all patient identifiers will be blinded on 
the copi[INVESTIGATOR_1091].  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Assessment of  Severity  
The investigator will make an assessment of severity for each AE and SAE reported during the 
study.  When applicable, AEs and SAEs should be assessed and graded based upon the 
NCI-CTCAE v4.03.   
Toxicities that are not specified in the NCI -CTCAE will be defined as follows:  
• Grade 1: Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations 
only; intervention not indicated  
• Grade 2: Moderate; minimal, local, or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting 
age-appropriate instrumental activities of daily living  
• Grade 3: Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3111]; disabling; limiting 
self-care activities of daily living  
Version .[ADDRESS_1000893] 2021  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 52 • Grade  4: Life -threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated  
• Grade 5: Death related to AE  
NOTE: The terms “severe” and “serious” are not synonymous. Severity is a measure of intensity 
(for example, grade of a specific AE, mild [Grade 1], moderate [Grad e 2], severe [Grade 3], or 
life-threatening [Grade 4]), whereas seriousness is classified by [CONTACT_338539].  Seriousness serves as the guide for defining regulatory reporting 
obligations from the sponsor to applicable reg ulatory authorities as described in Section 8.4.2 . 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Assessment of Causality  
The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between the study drug and the occurrence 
of each AE or SAE.  The investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the relationship.  
Alternative causes, such as natural history of the underlying diseases, concomitant therapy, other 
risk factors, and the temporal relationship of the AE or SAE to the study drug will be considered 
and investigated.  The investigator will also consult the Investigator’s Brochure and/or 
Prescribing Information, for marketed products, in the determination of his/her assessment.  
There may be situations when  an SAE has occurred, and the investigator has minimal 
information to include in the initial report to the sponsor.  However, it is very important that the 
investigator always makes an assessment of causality for every SAE prior to transmission of the 
SAE report to the sponsor since the causality assessment is one of the criteria used when 
determining regulatory reporting requirements.  The investigator may change his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_1095] -up information, amending the SAE report accord ingly.  
The causality of each AE should be assessed and classified by [CONTACT_1694] “related” or 
“not related”. An AE is considered related if there is “a reasonable possibility” that the AE may 
have been caused by [CONTACT_5257] (ie, there are facts,  evidence, or arguments to suggest 
possible causation).  A number of factors should be considered in making this assessment, 
including:  
• Temporal relationship of the AE to the administration of study treatment/study 
procedure  
• Whether an alternative etiology  has been identified  
• Mechanism of action of the study drug  
• Biological plausibility  
An AE should be considered ‘related’ to study drug if any of the following are met, otherwise the 
event should be assessed as not related:  
• There is clear evidence to suggest  a causal relationship, and other possible 
contributing factors can be ruled out  
• There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and the influence of other factors is 
unlikely  
Version .[ADDRESS_1000894] 2021  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 53 • There is some evidence to suggest a causal relationship (eg, the AE occurred  within a 
reasonable time after administration of the study drug).  However, the influence of 
other factors may have contributed to the AE (eg, the patient’s clinical condition or 
other concomitant AEs).  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Follow -Up of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Even ts 
After the initial AE or SAE report, the investigator is required to proactively follow each patient 
and provide further information to the sponsor on the patient’s condition.  
All AEs and SAEs documented at a previous visit/contact [CONTACT_732561]/contacts.  
All AEs and SAEs will be followed until resolution, the condition stabilizes or is considered 
chronic, the AE or SAE is otherwise explained, the patient is lost to follow -up or the patient 
withdraws conse nt.  Any changes in the severity of AEs/SAEs, must be recorded in the 
appropriate AE or SAE eCRF page(s); both increases in grade and decreases in grade will be 
recorded with updated start and stop dates.  The investigator will ensure that follow -up includ es 
any supplemental investigations as may be indicated to elucidate the nature and/or causality of 
the AE or SAE.  This may include additional laboratory tests or investigations, histopathological 
examinations, radiographic imaging, or consultation with ot her health care professionals.  
The sponsor may request that the investigator perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental 
measurements and/or evaluations to elucidate as fully as possible the nature and/or causality of 
the AE or SAE.  The investigato r is obligated to assist.  If a patient dies during participation in 
the study or during a recognized follow -up period, the sponsor will be provided with a copy of 
any post -mortem findings, including histopathology.  
New or updated information will be recor ded on the originally completed SAE report, with all 
changes signed and dated by [CONTACT_093].  The updated SAE report should be resent to the 
sponsor within the timeframes outlined in Section 8.4.[ADDRESS_1000895] Abnormalities  
Abnormal laboratory findings (eg, chemistry, CBC, or coagulation) or other abnormal 
assessments (eg, ECGs, X -rays, or vital signs) that are judged by [CONTACT_732562].  This includes clinically significant abnormal 
laboratory findings or other abnormal assessments that are present at baseline and significa ntly 
worsen during the study.  However, clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other 
abnormal assessments that are present at the start of the study and do not worsen will not be 
reported as AEs or SAEs.  The definition of clinically signif icant is left to the judgment of the 
investigator; in general, these are events that result in clinical signs or symptoms that require 
active medical intervention, or lead to dose interruption or discontinuation.  
8.2. Definition of a Serious Adverse Event  
An SA E is any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose:  
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening  
Version .[ADDRESS_1000896] 2021  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 54 NOTE: the term “life -threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an AE in 
which the patient was at risk of death at the time of the AE.  It does not refe r to an 
AE, which hypothetically might have caused death, if it were more severe.  
• Requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12331]: In general, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_69783] (usually 
involving at least an overnight stay) to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1083]/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the physician’s 
office or outpatient setting.  
• Results in disability/incapacity  
NOTE: The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to 
conduct normal life functions.  This definition is not intended to include experiences 
of relatively minor medical significance, such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, 
vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental traum a (eg, sprained ankle), which may 
interfere or prevent everyday life functions, but do not constitute a substantial 
disruption.  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• Is considered a significant medical AE by [CONTACT_509026] (eg, may jeopardize the patient or may require medical/surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above)  
The following are NOT  considered SAEs:  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5187] a pre -existing condition that did not worsen 
from baseline  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_16739]/convenience considerations  
• Scheduled therapy for the target disease of the study, including admissions for 
transfusion support or convenience  
8.3. Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction  
A suspected unexpected serious adverse r eaction (S[LOCATION_003]R) is a serious adverse reaction that is 
both unexpected (ie, not present in the product’s Reference Safety Information) and meets the 
definition of a serious adverse drug reaction, the specificity or severity of which is not consistent 
with t hose noted in the Investigator’s Brochure.  
8.4. Timing, Frequency, and Method of Capturing Adverse Events and 
Serious Adverse Events  
8.4.1.  Adverse Event Reporting Period  
After informed consent has been signed but prior to the administration of the study drug, only 
SAEs should be reported.  
Version .[ADDRESS_1000897] 2021  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 55 For patients receiving zanubrutinib plus obinutuzumab: all AEs and SAEs, regardless of 
relationship to study drug, will be reported until [ADDRESS_1000898] dose of obinutuzumab.  
For p atients receiving obinutuzumab monotherapy: all AEs and SAEs, regardless of relationship 
to study drug, will be reported until [ADDRESS_1000899] 
dose of obinutuzumab.  
After this period, the investigator should report any SAEs that are believed to be related to prior 
study drug treatment.  
8.4.2.  Reportin g Serious Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Prompt Reporting of Serious Adverse Events  
As soon as the investigator determines that an AE meets the protocol definition of an SAE, the 
event must be be reported promptly to the sponsor or designee as described in  Table  3.

Abbreviation : SAE, serious adverse event.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Completion and Transmission of the Serious Adverse Event Report  
Once an investigator becomes aware that an SAE has occurred in a patient, he/she will report the 
information to the sponsor within 24 hours as outlined above in S ection [IP_ADDRESS] .  The SAE report 
will always be completed as thoroughly as possible with all available details of the SAE and 
forwarded to the sponsor or designee within the designated timeframes.  
If the investigator does not have all information regarding an SAE, he/she will not wait to 
receive additional information before notifying the sponsor of the event and completing the form.  
The form will be updated when additional information is received.  
The in vestigator will always provide an assessment of causality for each SAE as described in 
Section [IP_ADDRESS] . 
The sponsor will provide contact [CONTACT_732563].  
Version .[ADDRESS_1000901] 2021  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 56 [IP_ADDRESS].  Regulatory Reporting Requirements for Serious Adverse Events  
The investigator will promptly report all SAEs to the sponsor in accordance with the procedures 
detailed in Section [IP_ADDRESS] .  The sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify, as appropriate, both 
the local regulatory authority and other regulatory agencies about the safety of a product under 
clinical investigation.  Prompt notification of  SAEs by [CONTACT_732564].  
The investigator, or responsible person according to local requir ements, will comply with the 
applicable local regulatory requirements related to the reporting of SAEs to regulatory authorities 
and the Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC).  
This protocol is being filed under an Investigatio nal New Drug (IND) protocol amendment with 
the [LOCATION_002] FDA.  Once active, a given SAE may qualify as an IND safety report if the 
SAE is both attributable to the study drug and unexpected.  In this case, all investigators filed to 
the IND (and associa ted INDs for the same compound) will receive an expedited investigator 
safety report, identical in content to the IND safety report submitted to the FDA.  
Expedited investigator safety reports are prepared according to the sponsor’s policy and are 
forwarded  to investigators as necessary.  The purpose of the report is to fulfill specific regulatory 
and Good Clinical Practice (GCP) requirements regarding the product under investigation.  
When a study center receives an initial or follow -up report or other safet y information 
(eg, revised Investigator’s Brochure) from the sponsor, the responsible person according to local 
requirements is required to promptly notify his/her IRB or IEC.  
8.4.3.  Eliciting Adverse Events  
The investigator or designee will ask about AEs by [CONTACT_732565]:  
• How are you feeling?  
• Have you had any medical problems since your last visit?  
• Have you taken any new medicines since your last visit?  
8.4.4.  Disease Progression  
Disease progression (including fatal disease progression), which is expected in this study 
population and measured as an efficacy endpoint, should not be reported as an AE term.  Instead, 
the symptoms, signs or clinical sequelae that result from disease progression should be reported 
as the AE term(s).  
For instance, a p atient presents with pleural effusion resulting from disease progression of 
metastasis to lungs.  The event term should be reported as “pleural effusion  due to disease 
progression ” instead of “disease progression ”.  If a patient experienced a fatal multi -organ failure 
due to disease progression, the term “multi -organ failure  due to disease progression ” should be 
reported as the SAE with death as outcome instead of reporting “fatal disease progression” or 
“death due to disease progression.”  
Version .[ADDRESS_1000902] 2021  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 57 8.4.5.  Deaths  
Death is an outcome and not usually considered an event. If the only information available is 
death and the cause of death is unknown, then the death is reported as an event, eg “death”, 
“death of unknown cause”, or “death unexplained.”  
8.4.6.  Pregnancies  
If a femal e patient or the partner of a male patient becomes pregnant while receiving study 
treatment or within [ADDRESS_1000903] dose of study drug, a pregnancy report form should be 
completed and expeditiously submitted to the sponsor to facilitate outcome follo w-up.  
Information on the status of the mother and child will be forwarded to the sponsor.  Generally, 
follow -up will be no longer than 6 to 8 weeks following the estimated delivery date.  Any 
premature termination of the pregnancy will be reported.  
While pregnancy itself is not considered to be an AE or SAE, any pregnancy complication or 
elective termination of a pregnancy for medical reasons will be recorded as an AE or SAE.  
An abortion, whether accidental, therapeutic, or spontaneous should be always rep orted as an 
SAE.  Similarly, any congenital anomaly/birth defect in a child born to a patient exposed to the 
study drug should be recorded and reported as an SAE.  
8.5. Post-Study Adverse Event  
A post -study AE or SAE is defined as any adverse event that occurs a fter the AE/SAE reporting 
period, defined in Section 8.4.1 . 
Investigators are not obligated to actively seek AEs or SAEs in former patients.  Howeve r, if the 
investigator learns of any SAE, including a death, at any time after a patient has been discharged 
from the study, and he/she considers the SAE related to the study drug, the investigator will 
notify the sponsor.  
8.6. Expedited Reporting to Health Authorities, Investigators, 
Institutional Review Boards and Ethics Committees  
The sponsor will promptly assess all SAEs against cumulative study drug experience to identify 
and expeditiously communicate new safety findings to regulatory authorities, invest igators, IRBs 
and IECs based on applicable legislation.  
To determine the reporting requirements for individual serious adverse events, the sponsor will 
assess the expectedness of the SAEs using the following reference documents:  
• BeiGene Investigator Brochure BGB -3111  
• Obinutuzumab Investigator Brochure and/or Prescribing Information (for marketed 
products)

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 58 9. STATISTICAL METHODS AND SAMPLE SIZE 
DETERMINATION  
All statistical analyses will be performed by [CONTACT_732566].  Details of the statistical analyses will be included in a 
separate statistical analysis plan (SAP).  
9.1. Study Endpoints  
9.1.1.  Primary Endpoint  
The primary endpoint is overall res ponse rate determined by [CONTACT_732567] (modified from Cheson et al, 2014 ).  The overall response rate is 
defined as the proportion of patients who achieve either complete  response or partial response as 
best overall response.  Best overall response is defined as best response achieved during the 
entire follow -up period.  However, for the patients in arm B who cross over to arm A, the disease 
assessment after the crossover will not be included in the derivation of best overall response.  
9.1.2.  Secondary Endpoints  
• Overall response rate determined by [CONTACT_3138]  
• Duration of response determined by [CONTACT_732530], defined as the ti me from the date that response criteria are first met to the 
date that disease progression is objectively documented or death, whichever occurs 
first 
• Progression -free survival determined by [CONTACT_732528], defined  as the time from randomization to the date of first 
documentation of disease progression or death, whichever occurs first  
• Overall survival defined as the time from randomization to the date of death due to 
any reason.  
• Rate of complete response or complete  metabolic rate determined by [CONTACT_732568], defined as the proportion of patients 
who achieve complete response or complete metabolic rate as best overall response  
• Time -to-response determined by [CONTACT_732569], defined as the time from randomization to the time the response criteria 
are first met  
• Patient -reported outcomes measured by [CONTACT_26740] -C30 and EQ -5D-5L 
questionnaires  
• Safety parameters, including AEs, SAEs, clinic al laboratory tests, physical exams, 
and vital signs  
• PK parameters such as apparent clearance of the drug from plasma (CL/F) and 
AUC 0-[ADDRESS_1000905] 2021

• Overall response rate in arm B after crossover to arm A.  
9.2. Statistical Analysis  
9.2.1.  Randomization Methods  
As discussed in Section 5.1, patients will be randomized using the IRT system for this study by 
[CONTACT_732570] (2 to 3 vs 
> 3), rituximab -refractory status (yes vs no), and geographic region (China vs ex -China) as 
strata.  
9.2.2.  Analysis Sets  
The Intent -to-Treat (ITT) analysis set includes all enrolled patients who are randomized.  The 
ITT analysis set will be the primary population used for efficacy analyses.   
The Safety analysis set includes all patients who received any dose of study drug.  Patients  will 
be included in the treatment groups corresponding to the actual treatment re ceived.  The Safety 
analysis set will be used for all safety analyses.  
The Per -Protocol analysis set includes patients who received any dose of study drug and had no 
major protocol deviations.  Criteria for exclusion from the Per -Protocol analysis set will  be 
determined and documented before the database lock for the primary analysis.  
The PK analysis set includes all zanubrutinib -treated patients who have at least one measurable 
PK concentration.  
9.2.3.  Efficacy Analysis  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Primary Efficacy Endpoint Analysis  
Primary  inference of comparing overall response rate by [CONTACT_732571] a Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel test adjusted for the randomization factors (number of 
prior lines of therapy [2 to 3 vs > 3] , rituximab -refractory status [yes vs no]) , and geographic 
region (China vs ex -China)  in the ITT analysis set.  
The null and alternative hypotheses for comparing overall response rate are as follows:  
 H0: ORR A = ORR B 
 Ha: ORR A > ORR B 
where ORR A is the overall response rate in arm A (zanubrutinib plus  obinutuzumab ) and ORR B 
is the overall response rate in arm B (o binutuzumab monotherapy ).  If the obtained one -sided 
p-value is ≤  0.025, it will be concluded that the combination therapy of zanubrutinib plus 
obinutuzumab results in a statistically signific antly increase in ORR versus obinutuzumab 
monotherapy; thereby [CONTACT_732535] A over arm B.  
A common response rate difference (ORR A - ORR B) will be estimated using Cochran -
Mantel -Haenszel weights based on the number of patients in ea ch stratum with 95% stratified 
confidence interval (CI). The common odds ratio of overall response rate and its  2-sided 95% 
Version .[ADDRESS_1000906] 2021  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 60 CIs will be calculated .  A Clopper -Pearson 95% CI of overall response rate will be constructed 
per each arm.  
Best overall response w ill be defined as the best response recorded from randomization till data 
cut or start of new anticancer treatment.  The disease assessments after crossover for patients in 
arm B who cross over to arm A will not be included in the determination of best ove rall 
response.  Patients with no post -baseline response assessment (due to whatever reason) will be 
considered as non -responders.  The proportion for each of the best response categories, complete 
response and partial response, will be presented by [CONTACT_34689].  
The data cutoff for the primary efficacy analysis will be approximately [ADDRESS_1000907] patient.   Study follow -up will continue as described in Section 3.4, 
Section 5.13, and Section 8.4. 
Additional analysis details will be provided in the SAP.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Secondary Ef ficacy Endpoint Analyses  
Duration of Response  
Duration of response will be summarized only for patients who have achieved an objective 
response.  The distribution of duration of response will be summarized for each treatment group 
by [CONTACT_8761] -Meier metho d. 
Progression -free Survival  
PFS will be compared based on the log -rank test stratified by [CONTACT_281272] (number of prior lines of therapy [2 to 3 vs > 3], rituximab -refractory status [yes vs no], 
and geographic region [China vs ex-China]).  The distribution of PFS, including median PFS and 
PFS rate at selected timepoints, will be estimated using the Kaplan -Meier method for each arm.  
The censoring rules for PFS will follow [LOCATION_002] FDA Guidance for Industry, Clinical Trial 
Endpoints for Approval of Cancer Drugs and Biologics  (2007 ) as follows.   
• PFS for patients without any post -baseline disease assessment will be censored at the 
time of randomization  
• PFS for patients without disease progression or death at the time of analysis will be 
censored at the time of the last disease assessment   
• PFS for patients who are lost to follow -up prior to documented disease progression 
will be censored at the last dise ase assessment date  
• PFS for patients who start to receive new anticancer therapy will be censored at the 
last tumor assessment date prior to the introduction of new therapy  
• PFS for patients with disease progression or death occurring immediately after two or 
more missed consecutive disease assessments will be censored at the last assessment 
tumor assessment before the missed consecutive disease assessments  
Version .[ADDRESS_1000908] 2021  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 61 Overall Survival  
OS between the 2 treatment groups will be compared using the same methods employed fo r the 
PFS comparison.  The distribution of OS (including median and other quartiles) and OS rate at 
selected timepoints will be estimated by [CONTACT_8761] -Meier method.  
Complete Response/Complete Metabolic Response  
CR rate and complete metabolic response rate  will be calculated as the proportion of patients 
who reached best overall response of CR (complete metabolic response) or higher.  The CR and 
complete metabolic response rate will be compared between treatment groups using Fisher’s 
exact test.  A Clopper -Pearson 95% CI of complete response rate and complete metabolic 
response rate will be constructed per each arm.  
Time -to-Response  
Time -to-response will be summarized only for responders by [CONTACT_732536], median and standard 
deviation for each treatment group.  
Patient -Reported Outcomes  
The EORTC QLQ -C30 questionnaire will be summarized for each assessment timepoint.  The 
percentage of patients with a clinically meaningful change from baseline in ‘global health 
status/QOL’ and functional domains will be summariz ed as “improved”, “stable” or “worsened” 
and compared between arms A and B.  The data will also be analyzed using repeated measure 
mixed model to account for missing data under missing at random assumption.  
Change of EQ -5D-5L score will be summarized desc riptively.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Exploratory Efficacy Endpoint Analysis  
The overall response rate in arm B after crossover to arm A will be summarized descriptively.  
An exact 95% CI will be provided.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Sensitivity Analysis  
A subgroup analysis for ORR by [CONTACT_732572].   
Primary and selected secondary endpoints may be analyzed using the Per -Protocol analysis set as 
sensitivity analyses.  
Time to event analysis for duration of response and time to response, which inclu des all patients, 
may be performed.  
A multiple logistic regression will be performed in order to explore the relationship between the 
baseline prognostic factors and ORR, as well as to estimate the treatment effect adjusted for the 
imbalances in those fac tors.  
9.2.4.  Pharmacokinetic Analyses  
Plasma zanubrutinib concentrations will be summarized by [CONTACT_397809].  A 
population PK analysis may be performed to include plasma concentrations of zanubrutinib from

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 62 this trial in an existing model.  PK par ameters such as apparent clearance of the drug from 
plasma and AUC 0-12 may be derived from the population PK analysis if supported by [CONTACT_33653].  
An exposure -response (efficacy or safety endpoints) analysis may be performed if supported by 
[CONTACT_33653].  The results fro m the population PK and exposure -response analyses may be reported 
separately from the Clinical Study Report.  
9.3. Safety Analyses  
Safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_556759] -CTCAE v4.03.   
Laboratory values (CBC, clinical chemistry, coagulation), vital signs, physical exams and 
electrocardiogram findings will also be used in determining the safety.  Descriptive statistics will 
be used to analyze all safety data by [CONTACT_1570].  
9.3.1.  Extent of Exposure  
Extent of exposure to st udy drug will be summarized descriptively as the number of cycles 
received (number and percentage of patients), duration of exposure (days), cumulative total dose 
received per patient (mg), dose intensity (mg/day) and relative dose intensity.  
The number (p ercentage) of patients requiring dose reductions, dose interruption, dose delay, and 
drug discontinuation due to AEs will be summarized.  The cycle in which the first dose 
reduction/interruption occurred will be summarized using descriptive statistics.  Fr equency of 
reductions and dose interruptions will be summarized by [CONTACT_10611].  
Patient data listings will be provided for all dosing records and for calculated summary statistics.  
9.3.2.  Adverse Events  
The AE verbatim descriptions (as recorded by [CONTACT_20616] r on the eCRF) will be classified 
into standardized medical terminology using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA®).  AEs will be coded to MedDRA (Version 18.1 or higher) lower level term closest 
to the verbatim term.  The linked MedDRA pr eferred term and primary system organ class are 
also captured in the database.  
A treatment -emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an AE that had an onset date or a 
worsening in severity from baseline (pretreatment) on or after the date of first dose of study drug 
up to 30 days following study drug discontinuation (Safety Follow -up visit) or initiation of new 
anticancer therapy, whichever comes first.  Only those AEs that were treatment -emergent will be 
included in summary tables.  All AEs, treatment -emergent or otherwise, will be presented in 
patient data listings.  
The incidence of treatment -emergent AEs will be reported as the number (percentage) of patients 
with treatment -emergent AEs by [CONTACT_6657].  A patient will be 
count ed only once by [CONTACT_732573] -CTCAE v.4.03 within a 
system organ class and preferred term, even if the patient experienced more than 1 
treatment -emergent AE within a specific system organ class and preferred term.  The number 
(percentage) of patients with treatment -emergent AEs will also be summarized by [CONTACT_732574].  Treatment -related AEs include those events considered by [CONTACT_732575].  SAEs, deaths,

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 63 treatment -emergent AEs ≥  Grade 3, related treatment -emergent AEs, and treatment -emergent 
AEs that led to treatment discontinuation, dose reduction or dose interruption will be 
summarized.  
Incidence and time to diarrhea (≥ Grad e 3), severe bleeding (defined as ≥ Grade 3 bleeding of 
any site or central nervous system bleeding of any grade), and atrial fibrillation will be 
summarized.  
9.3.3.  Laboratory Analyses  
CBC and serum chemistry values will be evaluated for each laboratory paramet er by [CONTACT_6490]. Abnormal laboratory values will be flagged and identified as those outside (above or 
below) the normal range.  Reference (normal) ranges for laboratory parameters will be included 
in the Clinical Study Report.  Descriptive summary st atistics (eg, n, mean, standard deviation, 
median, minimum, maximum for continuous variables; n [%] for categorical variables) for 
laboratory parameters and their changes from baseline will be calculated.  Laboratory values will 
be summarized by [CONTACT_338554] -baseline visit.  
Laboratory parameters that are graded in NCI -CTCAE (v.4.03)  will be summarized by [CONTACT_3596].  In the summary of laboratory parameters by [CONTACT_3229], parameters with CTCAE 
grading in both high and low directions (eg, calcium , glucose, magnesium, potassium, sodium) 
will be summarized separately.  
9.3.4.  Vital Signs  
Descriptive statistics for vital sign parameters (systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, 
temperature, and weight) and changes from baseline will be presented by  [CONTACT_732576].  Vital signs will be listed by [CONTACT_69867].  
9.3.5.  Electrocardiogram  
ECG assessments will be performed at the screening visit.  Descriptive statistics for baseline 
ECG parameters will be presented.  
9.3.6.  Sample Size Con siderations  
The sample size calculation is based on the comparison of the primary endpoint of ORR in the 
ITT analysis set.  Assuming ORR A = 0.55 and ORR B = 0.30, 210 patients will be enrolled in a 
2:1 ratio (140 patients in arm A and 70 patients in arm B) to provide a power of approximately 
91% in testing ORR A versus ORR B using a normal approximation to binomial distribution with a 
2-sided significance level of 0.[ADDRESS_1000911] 2021

11.2.4.  Investigator Reporting Requirements  
As indicated in Section [IP_ADDRESS] , the investigator (or sponsor, where applicable) is responsible for 
reporting SAEs to the IEC/IRB, in accordance with all applicable regulations.  Furthermore, the 
investigator may be required to provi de periodic safety updates on the conduct of the study at 
his/her study center and notification of study closure to the IEC/IRB.  Such periodic safety 
updates and notifications are the responsibility of the investigator and not of the sponsor.  
11.2.5.  Confidential ity 
Information on maintaining patient confidentiality in accordance with individual local and 
national patient privacy regulations must be provided to each patient as part of the informed 
consent form process, either as part of the ICF or as a separate si gned document (for example, in 
the US, a site -specific HIPAA consent may be used).  The investigator must assure that patients’ 
anonymity will be strictly maintained and that their identities are protected from unauthorized 
parties.  Only an identification  code (ie, not names) should be recorded on any form or biological 
sample submitted to the sponsor, IRB, or laboratory.  The investigator must keep a screening log 
showing codes, names, and addresses for all patients screened and for all patients enrolled in the 
trial. 
The investigator agrees that all information received from BeiGene, including but not limited to 
the IB, this protocol, CRFs, the investigational drug, and any other study information, remain the 
sole and exclusive property of BeiGene during the conduct of the study and thereafter.  This 
information is not to be disclosed to any third party (except employees or agents directly 
involved in the conduct of the study or as required by [CONTACT_2371]) without prior written consent from 
BeiGene.  The investiga tor further agrees to take all reasonable precautions to prevent the 
disclosure by [CONTACT_180412].  
11.2.6.  Case Report Forms  
For each patient randomized/assigned to treatment, an eCRF must be completed and signed by 
[CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_508962] a reasonable time period after data collection.  
If a patient withdraws from the study, the reason must be noted in the appropriate eCRF.  If a 
patient is withdrawn from t he study because of a treatment -limiting AE, thorough efforts should 
be made to clearly document the outcome.  
The eCRF exists within an electronic data capture ( EDC ) system with controlled access managed 
by [CONTACT_732577].  Study staff will be appropriately 
trained in the use of eCRFs and applications of electronic signatures before being given access to 
the EDC system.  Original data and any changes of data will be recorded using the EDC system, 
Version .[ADDRESS_1000917] 2021  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 67 with all changes tra cked by [CONTACT_135953].  The investigator 
attests that the information contained in the eCRF is true by [CONTACT_732578].  After final database lock, the investigator will receive  a copy of the 
patient data from that site (eg, paper, CD, or other appropriate media) for archiving the data at 
the study site.  
11.2.7.  Drug Accountability  
The investigator or designee (ie, pharmacist) is responsible for ensuring adequate accountability 
of all u sed and unused study drug.  This includes acknowledgment of receipt of each shipment of 
study product (quantity and condition), patient drug dispensation records and returned or 
destroyed study product.  Dispensation records will document quantities receiv ed from BeiGene 
and quantities dispensed to patients, including lot number, date dispensed, patient identifier 
number, and the initials of the person dispensing the medication.  
At study initiation, the monitor will evaluate the site’s standard operating pr ocedure for study 
drug disposal/destruction to ensure that it complies with BeiGene requirements.  At the end of 
the study, following final drug inventory reconciliation by [CONTACT_2037], the study site will dispose 
of and/or destroy all unused study drug su pplies, including empty containers, according to these 
procedures.  If the site cannot meet BeiGene’s requirements for disposal, arrangements will be 
made between the site and BeiGene or its representative for destruction or return of unused study 
drug sup plies.  
All drug supplies and associated documentation will be periodically reviewed and verified by [CONTACT_69878].  
11.2.8.  Inspections  
The investigator should understand that source documents for this trial should be made available  
to appropriately qualified personnel from BeiGene or its representatives, to IRBs/IECs, or to 
regulatory authority or health authority inspectors.  
11.2.9.  Protocol Adherence  
The investigator is responsible for ensuring the study is conducted in accordance with the 
procedures and evaluations described in this protocol.  Investigators assert they will apply due 
diligence to avoid protocol deviations.  
11.3. Protocol Modifications  
Protocol modifications, except those intended to reduce immediate risk to study patients, ma y be 
initiated only by [CONTACT_69870].  All protocol modifications must be submitted to competent 
authorities according to local requirements and to the IRB/IEC  together with, if applicable, a 
revised model ICF  in accordance with local requirements.  Written docu mentation from 
competent authorities (according to local requirements) and from the IRB/IEC and required site 
approval must be obtained by [CONTACT_5278].  
Information on any change in risk and /or change in scope must be prov ided to patients already 
actively participating in the study, and they must read, understand and sign each revised ICF 
confirming willingness to remain in the trial.  
Version .[ADDRESS_1000918] 2021  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 68 11.4. Study Report and Publications  
A clinical study report will be prepared and provided to the  regulatory agency(ies).  BeiGene will 
ensure that the report meets the standards set out in the ICH Guideline for Structure and Content 
of Clinical Study Reports (ICH E3).  Note that an abbreviated report may be prepared in certain 
cases.  
The results of t his study will be published or presented at scientific meetings in a timely, 
objective, and clinically meaningful manner that is consistent with good science, industry and 
regulator guidance, and the need to protect the intellectual property of BeiGene (sp onsor), 
regardless of the outcome of the trial.  The data generated in this clinical trial are the exclusive 
property of the sponsor and are confidential.  Because this is a multicenter study, the first 
publication or disclosure of study results shall be a  complete, joint multicenter publication or 
disclosure coordinated by [CONTACT_456].  Thereafter, any secondary publications will reference the 
original publication(s).  Authorship will be determined by [CONTACT_732579] ( International Committee 
of Medical Journal Editors, 2013 ). 
Each investigator agr ees to submit all manuscripts, abstracts, posters, publications, and 
presentations (both oral and written) to the sponsor prior to submission or presentation in 
accordance with the clinical study agreement.  This allows the sponsor to protect proprietary 
information, provide comments based on information from other studies that may not yet be 
available to the investigator, and ensure scientific and clinical accuracy.  Each investigator 
agrees that, in accordance with the terms of the clinical study agreemen t, a further delay of the 
publication/presentation may be request ed by [CONTACT_69881]/presentation.  
11.5. Study and Study Center Closure  
Upon completion of the study, the monitor will conduct the following a ctivities in conjunction 
with the investigator or study center personnel, as appropriate:  
• Return of all study data to the sponsor  
• Resolve and close all data queries  
• Accountability, reconciliation, and arrangements for unused study drug(s)  
• Review of study r ecords for completeness  
• Return of treatment codes to the sponsor  
• Shipment of PK samples to assay laboratories  
In addition, the sponsor reserves the right to suspend or prematurely discontinue this study either 
at a single study center or at all study cente rs at any time for reasons including, but not limited 
to, safety or ethical issues or severe noncompliance.  If the sponsor determines such action is 
needed, the sponsor will discuss this with the investigator (including the reasons for taking such 
action)  at that time.  When feasible, the sponsor will provide advance notification to the 
investigator of the impending action prior to it taking effect.  
Version .[ADDRESS_1000919] 2021  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 69 The sponsor will promptly inform all other investigators and/or institutions conducting the study 
if the study is suspended or terminated for safety reasons, and will also inform the regulatory 
authorities of the suspension or termination of the study and the reason(s) for the action.  If 
required by [CONTACT_5279], the investigator must inform the IE C/IRB promptly and 
provide the reason for the suspension or termination.  
If the study is prematurely discontinued, all study data must be returned to the sponsor.  In 
addition, arrangements will be made for all unused study drug(s) in accordance with the 
applicable sponsor procedures for the study.  
Financial compensation to investigators and/or institutions will be in accordance with the 
agreement established between the investigator and the sponsor.  
11.6. Records Retention and Study Files  
The investigator must maintain adequate and accurate records to enable the conduct of the study 
to be fully documented and the study data to be subsequently verified.  These documents should 
be classified into at least the following 2 categories: (1) investigator’s study file, and (2) patient 
clinical source documents.  
The investigator’s study file will contain the protocol/amendments, CRF and query forms, 
IRB/IEC, and governmental approval with correspondence, informed consent, drug records, staff 
curriculum vitae and authoriza tion forms, and other appropriate documents and correspondence.  
Patient clinical source documents (usually defined by [CONTACT_5280]/safety parameters independent of the CRFs) would include (although not be limited to) 
the fo llowing: patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/clinic records, physician’s and nurse’s notes, appointment book, 
original laboratory reports, electrocardiogram, electroencephalogram, X -ray, pathology and 
special assessment reports, consultant letters, screening and enrollment l og, etc.  
Following closure of the study, the investigator must maintain all study records in a safe and 
secure location.  The records must be maintained to allow easy and timely retrieval, when needed 
(eg, audit or inspection), and, whenever feasible, to allow any subsequent review of data in 
conjunction with assessment of the facility, supporting systems, and personnel.  Where permitted 
by [CONTACT_1207]/regulations or institutional policy, some or all of these records can be maintained in 
a format other than  hard copy (eg, microfiche, scanned, electronic); however, caution needs to be 
exercised before such action is taken.  The investigator must assure that all reproductions are 
legible, are a true and accurate copy of the original, and meet accessibility and  retrieval 
standards, including re -generating a hard copy, if required.  Furthermore, the investigator must 
ensure there is an acceptable back up of these reproductions and that an acceptable quality 
control process exists for making these reproductions.  
The sponsor will inform the investigator of the time period for retaining these records to comply 
with all applicable regulatory requirements.  The minimum retention time will meet the strictest 
standard applicable to that study center for the study, as dic tated by [CONTACT_69882], or the sponsor’s standards/procedures; otherwise, the 
retention period will default to [ADDRESS_1000920] notify the sponsor of any changes in the archival arrangements, inc luding, 
but not limited to, the following: archival at an off -site facility, transfer of ownership of the 
records in the event the investigator leaves the study center.  
If the investigator cannot guarantee this archiving requirement at the study site for a ny or all of 
the documents, special arrangements must be made between the investigator and BeiGene to 
store these in sealed containers outside of the site so that they can be returned sealed to the 
investigator in case of a regulatory audit.  When source d ocuments are required for the continued 
care of the patient, appropriate copi[INVESTIGATOR_69786].  
Biological samples remaining after this study may be retained in storage by [CONTACT_127026] a 
period up to 2  years.  
11.7. Information Disclosure and Inventions  
All information provided by [CONTACT_397829] (other than a patient’s medical records) is the sole property of the 
sponsor.  
All rights, title, and interests  in any inventions, know -how or other intellectual or industrial 
property rights which are conceived or reduced to practice by [CONTACT_338564] a result of the study are the sole property of the sponsor, and are hereby 
[CONTACT_69886].  
If a written contract for the conduct of the study which includes ownership provisions 
inconsistent with this statement is executed between the sponsor and the study center, that 
contract’s ownership provisions shall apply rather t han this statement.  
All information provided by [CONTACT_397829] (other than a patient’s medical records) will be kept by [CONTACT_69888].  This in formation and data will not be used by [CONTACT_732580].   
These restrictions do not apply to:  
• Information which becomes publicly available through no fault of the investigator  or 
study center personnel  
• Information which is necessary to disclose in confidence to an IEC/IRB solely for the 
evaluation of the study  
• Information which is necessary to disclose in order to provide appropriate medical 
care to a patient  
• Study results which may be published as described in Section 11.4. 
If a written contract for the conduct of the study which includes provisions inc onsistent with this 
statement is executed, that contract’s provisions shall apply rather than this statement.

11.8.1.  Access to Information for Monitoring  
In accordance with ICH GCP guidelines, the study monitor must hav e direct access to the 
investigator’s source documentation in order to verify the data recorded in the CRFs for 
consistency.  
The monitor is responsible for routine review of the CRFs at regular intervals throughout the 
study to verify adherence to the protocol and the completeness, consistency, and accuracy of the 
data being entered on them.  The monitor should have access to any patient records needed to 
verify the entries on the CRFs.  The investigator agrees to cooperate with the monitor to ensure 
that any problems detected in the course of these monitoring visits are resolved.  
11.8.2.  Access to Information for Auditing or Inspections  
Representatives of regulatory authorities or of BeiGene may conduct inspections or audits any 
time during or after completion of this clinical study.  If the investigator is notified of an 
inspection by a regulatory authority the investigator agrees to notify the sponsor or its designee 
immediately.  The investigator agrees to provide to representatives of a regulatory agency or 
BeiGene access to records, facilities, and personnel for the effective conduct of any inspection or 
audit.

It is recognized that in Waldeyer’s ring or extranodal  sites with 
physiologic uptake or with activation within spleen or 
marrow (e.g., with chemotherapy or myeloid colony -
stimulating factors), uptake may be greater than normal

*A score [ADDRESS_1000936] treatment, especially if at the time of an interim scan.  However, in trials involving PET 
where de -escalation is investigated, it may be preferable to consider a score of 3 as inadequate response (to avoid under treatment).  Measured dominant lesions: 
Up to six of the largest dominant nodes, no dal masses, and extranodal lesions selected to be clearly measurable in two diameters.  Nodes should preferably be 
from disparate regions of the body and should include, where applicable, mediastinal, and retroperitoneal areas.  Non -nodal lesions include t hose in solid organs 
(e.g., liver, spleen, kidneys, lungs), gastrointestinal involvement, cutaneous lesions, or those noted on palpation.  Non -measured lesions: Any disease not selected 
as measured, dominant disease and truly assessable disease should be c onsidered not measured.  These sites include any nodes, nodal masses, and extranodal 
sites not selected as dominant or measurable or that do not meet the requirements for measurability but are still considered abnormal, as well as truly assessable 
disease,  which is any site of suspected disease that would be difficult to follow quantitatively with measurement, including pleural e ffusions, ascites, bone 
lesions, leptomeningeal disease, abdominal masses, and other lesions that cannot be confirmed and followed  by [CONTACT_9661].  In Waldeyer’s ring or in extranodal 
sites (e.g., gastrointestinal tract, liver, bone marrow), FDG uptake may be greater than in the mediastinum with complete met abolic response, but should be no 
higher than surrounding normal physiologic upta ke (e.g., with marrow activation as a result of chemotherapy or myeloid growth factors).

• 1: no uptake above background  
• 2: uptake ≤ mediastinum  
• 3: uptake > mediastinum but ≤ liver  
• 4: uptake moderately > liver  
• 5: uptake markedly higher than liver and/or new lesions

Modification from Lugano Classification for NHL (Cheson et al, 2014):  
**Pseudoprogression has been observed in pati ents receiving a BTK inhibitor.  For patients in either arm, a timepoint finding of 
“disease progression” will require a confirmatory scan at least 4  weeks after the scan that demonstrated possible progression.  An 
exception to the confirmatory scan requirement exists if one or more of th e clear, clinical signs of progression detailed in Section 5.6 
is present and the investigator believes the progression is unequivocal.  Patients may continue study treatment while they wait for the 
confirmation imaging.  
Note:  Temporary withholding of study drug (eg, for drug -related toxicity, surgery, or intercurrent illness) for as little as 7 days can 
cause a transient worsening of disease and/or of constitutional symptoms.  In such circumstances, and if medically appr opriate, 
patients may resume therapy and relevant clinical, laboratory, and/or radiologic assessments should be performed to document 
whether tumor control can be maintained or whether actual disease progression has occurred.   
Isolated increase in lymph n odes and/or splenomegaly during periods of zanubrutinib hold will not be considered as progressive 
disease unless confirmed by a repeat imaging studies at least [ADDRESS_1000937] 2021

Version .[ADDRESS_1000942] dose for 96 weeks (approximately 24 months), then every 24 weeks for the next 
24 months and then yearly until disease progression.  To av oid duplication of physical examinations  and examination of liver and spleen  to fulfill the 
separate Safety and Efficacy requirements, the following guideline may be used: It is not necessary to perform duplicate assessments so long as each 
Cycle Visit and  Response Evaluation Visit window is met.  
c. To occur 30  (± 7) days after permanent discontinuation  of zanubrutinib and also 90 days after the permanent discontinuation of obinutuzumab (note: the 
obinituzumab safety follow -up visit may be performed as part of  a required visit for patients continuing on zanubrutinib) .  Patients must continue with the 
Response Evaluation schedule until date of centrally confirmed disease progression.  
d. Response assessments  repeat every [ADDRESS_1000943] 
(contact [CONTACT_732582] [with the patient’s guardian, if applicable]).  
e. This must occur before any study -specific procedures, and may be obtained before the [ADDRESS_1000944] be o btained using the 
current version of the form approved by [CONTACT_107650].  
f. After a patient is screened and the investigator determines the patient is eligible for randomization, study site personnel w ill complete an Eligibility 
Authorization Packet an d email it to the medical monitor or designee to approve the enrollment in writing.  Study site personnel should ensure that a medical 
monitor -approved Eligibility Packet is in the patient’s file before proceeding with study procedures.   
g. Eligible patients  will be randomized based on number of prior lines of therapy (2 to 3 vs ˃  3), rituximab -refractory status (yes vs no), and geographic region 
(China vs ex -China).  Central randomization (2:1) will be used to assign patients to 1 of the following 2 arms: za nubrutinib plus obinutuzumab or 
obinutuzumab monotherapy. Study treatment must commence within 5  days after randomization.  
h. If an archival tissue sample is available, it should be sent to the central pathology laboratory for confirmation of tissue d iagnosis .  It is not required that the 
archival tissue sample be sent before randomization/treatment assignment  
i. Obinutuzumab (arms A and B) will be administered 1,000 mg intravenously on days 1, 8, and 15 of Cycle 1, then 1,000 mg on Day 1 of Cycles 2 to 6, then 
1,000 mg every 8 weeks.  (At the discretion of the investigator, obinutuzumab may be administered 100 mg on Day 1 and 900 mg on Day 2 of Cycle 1 
instead of 1,000 mg on Day 1 of Cycle 1.)  Responding patients may continue to receive maintenance obinutuzumab every 8 weeks for an additional 24 
months (eg, maximum total duration of obinutuzumab of approximately 30 months  [maximum 20 doses] ). 
j. Zanubrutinib will be administered as two 80 -mg capsules by [CONTACT_326372] a day (160 mg twice a day) with or without food.  P atients who progress on 
obinutuzumab monotherapy are able to crossover to receive obinutuzumab plus zanubrutinib with confirmation of PD and discussi on with medical monitor.  
At the end of Cycle 12, patients in the obinutuzumab arm without a PR or CR have the option to crossover to receive obinutuzumab plus zanubrutinib.  
k. Sparse PK samples will be collected from patients randomized to arm A (zanubrutinib plus obinutuzumab) at the following time points: predose ( within 
30 min prior to zanubrutinib dosing ) and 2 hours (±  30 min) post zanubrutinib dose on Day [ADDRESS_1000945] of care at the study site and as clinically indicated by [CONTACT_23805].  Includes weight (height at sc reening only).   
n. A 12 -lead electrocardiogram (ECG) will be performed in  triplicate at screening.   
o. Collect non -serious AE information from the time of first dose of study drug through safety follow -up.  Collect SAE information from the time of signed 
Version .[ADDRESS_1000946] und ergo PET/CT scan during screening.  Patients whose disease is not FDG -avid at 
screening will be followed by [CONTACT_4654] -based assessments alone.  Patients whose disease is FDG -avid at screening will be followed by [CONTACT_732583] -CT 
and CT -based assessments a s follows:  PET -CT scans are required at screening, end of Cycles 3, 6, and 12, and to confirm a result on CT scan (CR/PR or 
disease progression); CT scans with contrast are required at all other tumor response assessments.  For patients with a contraindic ation to receiving CT scan 
IV-contrast (eg, contrast allergy, or other medical contraindication such as renal insufficiency ), MRI may be used in place of CT scans.  For patients being 
assessed via MRI, a non -contrast chest CT scan is acceptable, and prefer red, in place of a chest MRI to evaluate the lung parenchyma.   The same imaging 
technique (ie , CT, MRI) should  be used consistently throughout a patient’s time on the study .  Copi[INVESTIGATOR_732525].  
q. Bone marrow biopsy is required under the following conditions during the treatment period: during screening to assess bone ma rrow involvement of 
lymphoma; and if clinical and laboratory results demonstrate that a CR has been achieved, in order to confirm a CR.  All of the pathology samples will be 
collected and reviewed by a pathologist from central pathology laboratory.  
r. Patients should complete the EQ -5D-5L and EORTC QLQ -C30 questionnaires before the first dose of study drug, and when possible before performing any 
other procedures.   No PRO questionnaires are required during crossover treatment.   
s. Complete blood count and differential will be evaluated by a central laboratory.  CBC includes hemoglobin, hematocrit, platel et count, red blood cell count, 
white blood cell count with differential including neutrophils (including bands), lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, and ba sophils.  
t. Serum chemistry will be evaluated by a central laboratory and includes sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, gl ucose, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, 
calcium, phosphate/phosphorus, magnesium, total bilirubin, total protein, albumin, ALT, AST, lactate dehydrogenase, and alkal ine phosphatase.  
u. Quantitative serum immunoglobulins (IgG, IgM, IgA) will be measured at scr eening; on Day 1 of Cycle 3, Cycle 6, Cycle 9, and Cycle  12; and then every 
[ADDRESS_1000947] . 
v. β2-Microglobulin will be assessed by a local laboratory e ither during screening or predose on Day 1 of Cycle  1 (central lab services may be used in some 
countries).  β 2-Microglobulin may be tested postdose as medically necessary.  
w. Prothrombin time , which will also be reported as international normalized ratio , and activated partial thromboplastin time will be evaluated by a central 
laboratory.  
x. Patients who are at risk for HBV reactivation as defined in Section 5.[ADDRESS_1000948] monthly.   Hepatitis B and hepatit is C testing will be by [CONTACT_102127], but central lab services may be used in some countries – for example if required to achieve the needed sensitivity.  
y. For all women of childbearing potential (including those who have had a tubal ligation), a serum  pregnancy test will be performed at screening, within 
7 days of randomization, and at end of treatment.  During treatment, l aboratory -based , highly -sensitive pregnancy tests (urine or serum) will be performed 
within [ADDRESS_1000949] dose of study drug  (even if the timing falls outside of the normally scheduled visit s).  Pregnancy 
tests will be evaluated by [CONTACT_169662].  If a urine pregnancy test is positive, it must be confirmed by a serum pregnancy test.

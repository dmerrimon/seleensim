2- the wording of “a total of 300 patients” is replaced by a “total of at least 
300 patients” to cover the fact that a total of 323 patients were actually 
randomized in the study. Due to the high number of screened patients, it 
was deemed appropriate to keep screened and eligible patients to 
participate in the study.  This adaptation is applied in the following

concerns, the use of dose [ADDRESS_950279]-PXT3003-02 upon Sponsor decision (September 18th, 2017).  
The stability testing at Quay Pharma ([LOCATION_006]) observed the occurrence of 
crystals in one stability batch of PXT3003 dose 2 at month 18 (September 
14th, 2017), whereas this was not the case at month 12. This new finding is 
inconsistent with the dose [ADDRESS_950280]-PXT3003-03 to 
receive the equivalent of dose 2 (5 mL per administration), by [CONTACT_699990], i.e. twice the dose 1 IMP (2x5 mL, i.e. 10 mL) per 
administration. 
Furthermore, all patients using dose 1 IMP or placebo will continue to 
receive dose 1 IMP or placebo (5 mL per administration) in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_699936]-PXT3003-[ADDRESS_950281]-PXT3003-02, Version 1.4 dated 05th December 2017

IMPACTED OF THE PROTOCOL AMENDMENT V1.4 
 
1. How to manage the 
dose 2 patient group 
discontinuation? 
 The PXT3003 dose [ADDRESS_950282]-PXT3003-02, in accordance with section 11.6.1 “if the 
study is prematurely discontinued then enrolled patients should be 
called for an end of study visit”.  
Hence, there is no need to implement additional information in the 
protocol.  
The sites will receive additional useful instructions to organise the 
recall of dose 2 IMP patients.    
2 Statistical sections: 
how to manage 
incomplete data 
 Due to incomplete data in the dose 2 arm, the missing data will be 
evaluated as described in the section 14.5 of the protocol.  
3 Section 11.7 follow 
up extension study – 
adapted as followed Patients who completed this 15-month study or who were 
prematurely discontinued from the PXT3003 dose [ADDRESS_950283]-
PXT3003-03.  
Patients previously assigned to dose 2 PXT3003 will receive the 
equivalent of dose 2 (i.e. 5 mL per administration), by [CONTACT_699991], i.e. twice the dose 1 PXT3003 (2x5 mL, i.e. 10 mL 
per administration) in the study CLN-PXT3003-03.    
Patients previously assigned to dose [ADDRESS_950284] completed the pi[INVESTIGATOR_699937] 1 
PXT3003 (5 mL) in the study CLN-PXT3003-03. 
Hence the protocol of extension study has been amended to assign 
all placebo patients to dose 1 IMP only, whereas patients previously 
assigned to dose 1 IMP will continue to do so. As a consequence of 
the difference of IMP volume (i.e. 5 mL and 10 mL) to be 
administered the study has become an open-label study that no 
longer randomizes patients to study treatment.

Study No:   CLN-PXT3003-02    Study name:   [CONTACT_700083]-CMT  
Title International, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III study 
assessing in parallel groups the efficacy and safety of 2 doses of PXT3003 in patients with 
Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A treated for 15 months. 
Phase Phase III 
Indication  Charcot Marie Tooth Disease - Type 1A (CMT1A)  
Investigational 
Drug PXT3003, a fixed dose combination of RS-Baclofen, Naltrexone hydrochloride and D-Sorbitol 
Study Design Double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, 3 parallel groups, international multi-center 
study for 15 months (65 weeks). 
Study duration Patients will be randomized after a screening period (up to 30 days) during which selection 
criteria are verified and baseline assessments such as electrophysiological testing, lab tests 
and ECG are performed. Then, after randomization, patients will be included in the study 
under double blind study medication for [ADDRESS_950308] 300 patients  will be randomized (1:1:1) into 3 parallel groups: PXT3003 
Dose 1, PXT3003 Dose 2 or matching Placebo (100/group), to achieve a power of at least 
90% to detect the expected effect as significant with the primary efficacy analysis.

 CMT1A, the most frequent CMT subtype (40 to 50% of all CMT), belongs to the group of 
inherited, progressive, chronic sensory and motor peripheral neuropathies referred to as 
Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease  or also as “Hereditary Motor and Sensory Neuropathy” 
(HMSN) or “Peroneal Muscular Atrophy” (PMA).  
CMT1A is caused by a specific duplication in the gene encoding for the "peripheral myelin 
protein of 22 Kilodalton" ( PMP22 ) expressed in Schwann cells and could be defined as a 
gene-dosage disease causing a 1.5-fold over-expression of the PMP22 protein in Schwann 
cells. The moderately elevated expression of this gene disrupts peripheral nerve myelination 
by [CONTACT_699996], slows signal transmission alongside the axons and 
deprives them of important neurotrophic factors normally provided by [CONTACT_699997]. Ultimately, axonal loss is responsible for the clinical phenotype due to muscle and 
sensory organ denervation.   
PXT3003, is a fixed dose combination of (RS)-baclofen, naltrexone hydrochloride and D-
sorbitol selected via a Systems Biology approach and developed by [CONTACT_699998], with the aim 
to lower toxic PMP22 gene over-expression in CMT1A.  
The expected effect of the combination of the three drugs in the treatment of CMT1A has 
been demonstrated first pre-clinically ex vivo  and in vivo (Chumakov, Milet et al.,  2014), and 
then by a phase II proof of concept study testing 3 doses of the combination at the same 
ratio compared to Placebo in 80 patients with CMT1A treated for 12 months. This phase II 
study demonstrated the good tolerability and safety of 3 tested doses of PXT3003 (primary 
outcome measure) and provided preliminary evidence of efficacy with a significant ‘dose-
effect’ and an increasing effect among the [ADDRESS_950309] dose baclofen, naltrexone and sorbitol 
were administrated at much lower doses (10 to 100 times less) than used for their 
respective approved indications as daily doses were [ADDRESS_950310]-PXT3003-02, Version 1.4 dated 05th December 2017  
 
CONFIDENTIAL Page 10 / 79 Rational (con’t) 210 mg sorbitol (Attarian, Vallat et al. , 2014).  
It is postulated that PXT3003 deserves further clinical investigation in a pi[INVESTIGATOR_699940] a larger CMT1A population. For this next study, 2 doses will be tested, compared to 
placebo: the highest dose found effective in the phase II and a higher dose (double dose 
with the same ratio between each active components of PXT3003). The choice for this 
additional dose was limited by [CONTACT_699999], that could not be increased above 6 mg 
given twice a day, in order to avoid known side effects with this drug particularly for chronic 
administration in active young people, and to preserve a good safety profile. As there is no 
approved treatment in CMT1A, there is no comparator to introduce, as usually done in 
Phase III trials. The 2 tested doses will be compared only to Placebo in a randomized double-
blind design with 3 balanced groups (1:1:1). Study objective(s) Primary objective: 
To assess the efficacy of PXT3003 compared to Placebo on the disability measured by [CONTACT_700000]1A patients treated for 15 months. 
 
Secondary objectives: 
- To assess the efficacy of PXT3003 compared to Placebo on clinical and functional tests, 
electrophysiological parameters, and measures of quality of life; 
- To assess the safety and tolerability of PXT3003 compared to Placebo;  
- To assess plasma concentrations of PXT3003 components (at peak and trough) when 
administered with 2 different doses; 
- To assess the change over time of potential blood biomarkers;  
- To assess molecular changes in skin biopsy, when this procedure will be possible 
(ancillary sub-study); 
- To explore potential new imaging biomarkers by  [CONTACT_700001], when this procedure will be 
possible (ancillary sub-study).

treatments 
 
Dose regimen 
 
 
 
  PXT3003 is a fixed dose combination of RS-baclofen, naltrexone hydrochloride and D-
sorbitol. Two doses of PXT3003 will be tested: 
Dose 1 = 3 mg baclofen, 0.35 mg naltrexone and 105 mg sorbitol given twice daily; 
Dose 2 = 6 mg baclofen, 0.70 mg naltrexone and 210 mg sorbitol given twice daily; 
The control group will be matching placebo. 
Patients will be randomized in 3 groups in order to receive either PXT3003 at one of the 2 
different doses or placebo. 
PXT3003 and placebo will be supplied as 100 mL clear oral solution in amber glass bottle (for 
10 days of treatment) which will be delivered with a plastic adapter and an adaptable plastic 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_699941] a [ADDRESS_950313] the same presentation and taste.  
PXT3003 and placebo will be provided in carton boxes of 4 bottles. 
The study drug (PXT3003 or matching placebo) will be administered per oral route 5 ml 
twice daily (morning and evening with food) for 15 months. 
To improve tolerability, treatment should start progressively (for all randomized patients): 
half dose (2.5 mL of the liquid formulation) will be administered twice a day during the two 
first weeks and then will be increased to the full dose (5 mL of the liquid formulation) twice 
a day until the end of study treatment. 
Concomitant

- Incidence of all Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs); they will be evaluated by 
[CONTACT_24975]/nature, severity/intensity, seriousness, duration, relationship to study drug, and 
outcome; 
- Incidence of related TEAEs (including possibly and probably related TEAEs) with a 
moderate or severe intensity; 
- Incidence of AE leading to withdrawal of study drug; 
- Incidence of Serious Adverse Events (SAEs); 
- Change in physical examination, vital signs (blood pressure and heart rate), 12-lead 
ECG, and laboratory data (hematology and blood chemistry).

  Plasma concentrations of baclofen, naltrexone and 6ß-naltrexol will be obtained at 
Baseline, 6-months, 12-month and 15-month visits (PK samples at trough and at peak).  
 Blood biomarkers: blood sampling will be performed for biomarkers and the tubes will 
be stored at -80°C 
o Pharnext has identified potential blood biomarkers in the previous phase II that need 
to be confirmed in this phase III: tryptophan, alanine, serotonin, T4, free cholesterol. 
Other markers could be assessed for quantification studies, and thus identified later 
after the accomplishment of this clinical trial.  
o Gene expression studies (microarrays and PCRs) may be also performed aiming to 
identify genes that could change in response to PXT3003 treatment, which could 
confer them the property of pharmacodynamics candidates. 
o DNA sequencing to advance the understanding CMT1A disease for the research

(con’t) community in general for research purposes. 
 
 Skin biopsy ( optional ancillary sub-study ) for molecular biology will be done (fixation for 
RNA preservation during 24 hours and then storage at -80°C until pi[INVESTIGATOR_9696]-up). Analysis RNA 
will be performed by [CONTACT_699998].

 Analysis populations: The Full Analysis Set (FAS)  will be constituted by [CONTACT_700006]. The Per-Protocol (PP)  population will include all the patients of the FAS without 
major protocol violation during the course of the study.  
All the efficacy analyses will be conducted on the FAS population and reproduced on the PP 
population for sensitivity purposes. The safety analyses will be conducted on the FAS, given 
that all randomized patients will receive at least one dose of treatment. 
Primary efficacy analysis: The significance of the studied drug effect compared with Placebo 
will be tested by [CONTACT_400345] (ANCOVA) on the summary mean of ONLS at 12 
and 15 months adjusted for baseline ONLS values. ANCOVA will be featured by a Linear 
Mixed Model (LMM), including baseline ONLS values and treatment as fixed factors, and 
center as random effect.  
Two active doses will be compared to Placebo. As the monotonicity of dose effect is not 
assumed, each dose will be compared at a two-sided 2.5% significance level, in order to 
preserve an overall false-positive rate of 5%. 
Sample size calculation: Assuming ANCOVA with [ADDRESS_950314]-baseline measures, a linear 
correlation coefficient of ONLS of R = 0.[ADDRESS_950315] deviation of ONLS of SD ≅ 1, a standardized mean difference of SMD = 0.3 should 
be detected versus Placebo with a power of 90% at a two-sided 2.5% significance level when 
the sample size reaches at least 89 patients per group. Assuming a drop-out rate of ≅ 10%, 
we anticipate recruiting [ADDRESS_950316] 300 patients . 
Secondary efficacy analyses: The primary ANCOVA analysis based on the summary mean at 
12 and 15 months will be repeated on the other quantitative efficacy endpoints (see above). 
The significance of the treatment effect on each quantitative endpoint will also be evaluated 
based on the difference compared to Placebo in change from baseline at each individual 
visit and in slope of progression over the duration of the study. The proportion of 
responders at 15 months will be assessed through a Generalized Linear Mixed Model 
(GLMM) featuring logistic regression, and admitting center as a random effect.  
Missing data: Missing values will be imputed using a linear model estimated on the Placebo 
group. The potential impact of missing data on the study’s conclusions will be evaluated.  
Safety analyses:  Safety and tolerability will be assessed by [CONTACT_700007] (AEs), change in physical examination, vital signs, electrocardiogram (ECG) 
and laboratory data. 
Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB): An independent DSMB will regularly follow the 
progress of the clinical trial, monitor safety data and critical efficacy variables, and be 
consulted concerning the opportunity of modifying the sample size or terminate the trial for 
futility.  
Adaptive sample size:  An estimation of the adjusted standard deviation (ASD) will be 
performed when [ADDRESS_950317]-PXT3003-02, Version 1.4 dated 05th December 2017

 exceeds 0.1, the sample size will be recalculated. The adaptive sample size calculation will 
be organized blind to treatment and do not require any type-I adjustment. 
Futility analysis : A one-stage Futility stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_699942], 
probability to detect a significant result at the end of the study, given the results observed 
at an intermediate time. Conditional Power (CP) will be estimated through B-values and (Lan 
and Wittes, 1988; Lan and Zucker, 1993). This analysis will be carried out by a third party 
statistician when at least 100 patients are available, and futility threshold  will be CP min=0.10 
involving a slight increase of type 2 error (β = 0.1/0.9 = 0.111-0.10 ≅ 0.01) (Proschan, 1999). 
This intermediate futility analysis does not require any type-I adjustment, this trial does not 
plan g rejection of the null hypothesis before its end. 
Further details will be described in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) as appropriate. 
Study schedule 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Usually patients come to visit their specialist annually and many of them may live far from 
the reference center, so the number of visits is limited.  
The study will be conducted for a  total of 15 months  with evaluation visits at baseline 
(screening and/or randomization visit), at 6, 12 and 15 months.  
Intermediate visits are scheduled at 3 and 9 months for drug dispensation, checking safety 
(AEs) and treatment compliance. Eventually if local regulations allow that the dispensing of 
medication can be organized by [CONTACT_11675][INVESTIGATOR_007], these intermediate visits at 3 and 9 months may 
be made by [CONTACT_25600].  
Visits will be scheduled as following: 
 V0 - Screening visit:      Day-1 to Day -30 max 
 V1 -   Inclusion visit (Baseline):     at Day 0  
 V2 -   3-month visit (or telephone call):  at Day 90 ± 8 Days 
 V3 -  6-month visit:    at Day 180 ± 10 Days 
 V4 -   9-month visit (or telephone Call):  at Day 270 ± 10 Days 
 V5 -  12-month visit:      at Day 360 ± 10 Days 
 V6 -  15-month visit:    at Day 450 ± 10 Days 
If one visit date is changed (anticipated or delayed), the next visit should occur according to 
the original schedule

CONFIDENTIAL Page 22 / 79 6. INTRODUCTION 
6. 1 Charcot Marie Tooth disease - Type 1A (CMT1A): Background 
CMT1A is a rare disease belonging to the group of inherited, progressive, chronic sensory and motor 
peripheral neuropathies referred to as Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease or also as “Hereditary Motor 
and Sensory Neuropathy” (HMSN) or “Peroneal Muscular Atrophy” (PMA), presently incurable, and the 
most common inherited disorder of the peripheral nervous system (PNS) (Kochanski, 2005; Patzko and 
Shy, 2011).  
Different types of CMT disease can be distinguished by [CONTACT_700008], by [CONTACT_700009]. Although the neurophysiological classification remains the 
most widely used (CMT1 corresponding to the demyelinating type and CMT2 corresponding to the 
axonal type, as identified by [CONTACT_700010]), the more precise genetic 
classification is increasingly applied. 
CMT1A is characterized by [CONTACT_700011] (NCV) slowings (by 
[CONTACT_108]: NCV) < 38 m/sec) which correspond to an homogeneous dysmyelination process, later 
followed by [CONTACT_700012]. CMT clinical phenotypes present common characteristics of progressive 
distal muscle weakness and atrophy, foot deformities, mild to moderate distal sensory loss, depressed 
tendon reflexes and high-arched feet (Bird and Adam, 1993). Weakness of the feet and of lower leg 
muscles may result in foot drop and induces a high-stepped gait with frequent trippi[INVESTIGATOR_699943]. Foot 
deformities, such as high arches and hammertoes are also characteristic due to weakness of the small 
muscles in the feet. In addition, the lower legs may take on an "inverted champagne bottle" appearance 
due to the loss of muscle bulks. Symptoms of CMT1A disease usually begin in adolescence or early 
adulthood (between age 5 and 25 years). This disease is characterized by [CONTACT_700013]. Later, weakness and muscle atrophy will involve the hands, resulting in difficulty with 
fine motor skills. The severity of symptoms is quite variable in different patients and even among other 
diseased family members. Progression of symptoms is gradual. Pain can range from mild to severe, and 
some patients may need to rely on foot or leg braces or other orthopaedic devices to maintain mobility; 
5% of individuals become wheelchair dependent. Although CMT1A is not a fatal disease, it is considered 
as chronically debilitating. 
CMT1A is a subtype of CMT Type 1. CMT1A is caused by [CONTACT_700014]22  gene at chromosome 
17p11.2 diagnosed by [CONTACT_37688][INVESTIGATOR_007]. Peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP22) is a [ADDRESS_950334] 
myelin protein with four transmembrane domains. Duplication of PMP22 is associated with an increased 
messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) in peripheral nerves; it results in an abnormal myelination process 
induced by [CONTACT_229274] (Gabriel, Erne et al., 1997; Vallat, Sindou et al. , 1996). The 
moderately elevated expression of this gene disrupts the normal myelination process that concerns 
neuron and Schwann cells, slows down the signal transmission along the axons and deprives them of 
important neurotrophic factors normally provided by [CONTACT_700015]. So, over-expression of the 
wild-type PMP22 protein is responsible for CMT 1A, which is the most frequent demyelinating subform 
of CMT disease (Bird and Adam, 1993; Fortun, Go et al. , 2006; Patzko and Shy, 2011). 
CMT1A accounts for 70 to 80% of CMT Type 1 patients and for 40 to 50% of all CMT patients (Bird and 
Adam, 1993; Dubourg, Tardieu et al. , 2001; Boerkoel, Takashima et al. , 2002; Reilly, 2005; Pareyson, 
Scaioli et al. , 2006; Shy, Chen et al. , 2008). The prevalence of CMT1A is estimated to be of 1.4 per 10,000 
people in the European Community. 
There is currently no approved treatment available to cure CMT1A disease, nor medical guidelines for 
the management of the disease (Mathis, Magy et al.,  2015).  
Supportive therapi[INVESTIGATOR_699944]. The most useful 
supportive treatments include treatment of pain (anti-inflammatory/analgesics, anti-depressants or 
Study PLEO-CMT US - Protocol CLN-PXT3003-02, Version 1.4 dated 05th December 2017  
 
CONFIDENTIAL Page 23 / 79 anti-convulsive drugs for neuropathic pain) (Shy, 2006), physiotherapy (muscle strength training), 
occupational therapy, orthopaedic devices (including braces and high top shoes) as well as orthopaedic 
surgery. However these treatments are not sufficient to limit impairment of motor function and 
worsening of disability. 
Ascorbic acid (AA) was shown to promote myelination in vitro  and to possibly decrease PMP22 
expression (Passage, Norreel et al. , 2004; Kaya, Belin  et al. , 2007). In vivo , ascorbic acid was shown to 
reduce the severity of neuropathy in a rodent model of human CMT1A: transgenic mice overexpressing 
PMP22 (Passage, Norreel et al. , 2004). To the best of our knowledge, the study was not replicated and 
no studies were conducted with ascorbic acid on other animal models of CMT1A.  On the basis of these 
data, several clinical trials were initiated to assess the efficacy of ascorbic acid in patients with CMT1A. A 
meta-analysis of available clinical trial data suggested that high doses of AA may provide significant 
benefit in patients with CMT (Young, De Jonghe et al. , 2008).  
Six additional published clinical trials assessed 1- or 2-year AA treatment but failed to show a significant 
clinical benefit:  
1- In a pi[INVESTIGATOR_699945], ascorbic acid had no significant effect in five patients (aged 
14–24 years) treated with 2 g/day for one year compared with six patients on placebo (aged 13–24 
years) (Verhamme, de Haan et al. , 2009).  
2- In an Australian trial, 42 children treated with an equivalent dose (30 mg/kg per day) for one year 
failed to show a significant improvement compared with 39 children on placebo (Burns, Ouvrier et al. , 
2009).  In a post-hoc analysis, five children treated with ascorbic acid had a large increase in motor 
conduction velocity in the median nerve. 
3- In a pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], open-label, cohort-controlled US trial, 12 patients (aged 31-41 years) treated for 2 years 
with a high dose (5 g/day) of ascorbic acid did not show any improvement as compared with a cohort of 
10 untreated CMT1A patients. Further, tolerability of this high dose of ascorbic acid appeared to be 
poor: only 42% of patients could tolerate 5g for 2 years, and 50% developed prominent diarrhoea 
and/or gastric bloating (Toth, 2009). 
4- In a randomized French trial 179 adult patients were treated for one year with one of two doses of 
ascorbic acid (1 or 3 g/day) or placebo. Ascorbic acid was safe and well tolerated, but failed to show 
significant benefit.  A post-hoc analysis of the clinical sub score of the CMTNS, the CMTES, showed 
however that the high dose group scored significantly better than the other groups (Micallef, Attarian et 
al., 2009). 
5- A 2-year placebo-controlled multicenter trial conducted in Italy and in the [LOCATION_006] in 271 patients (aged 
18-70 years) with DNA proven CMT1A failed to show significant benefit of ascorbic acid (Pareyson, Reilly 
et al. , 2011). 
6- An US randomized, placebo-controlled, clinical trial in 110 subjects with CMT1A, aged 13 to 70 years, 
treated with AA or placebo (randomization 1:4) over a period of 24 months was recently published. The 
trial was designed to determine whether it would be futile to carry out a larger randomized, double-
blind, placebo- controlled trial to examine the efficacy of high dosage AA in slowing the progression of 
CMT1A. The study failed to show efficacy of AA 4g/d compared to placebo and definitely closed any 
hope in this potential treatment. (Burns, Ouvrier et al. , 2009; Micallef, Attarian et al. , 2009; Toth, 2009;

CONFIDENTIAL Page 24 / [ADDRESS_950335] of our knowledge, no other drug is currently being investigated in clinical stage in this 
pathology. 
Considering the debilitating nature of the disease and the absence of a specific therapy, there remains a 
pressing unmet medical need for an efficacious and safe treatment for CMT1A. 
6. 2 Pharnext approach and PXT3003 selection  
Pharnext is repositioning off-patent drugs (marketed in Europe and North America) reformulated and 
combined in low doses associations for the treatment of novel indications with a high unmet medical 
need through the application of an innovative approach. The underlying principle behind this approach 
is “network pharmacology” in which multiple targets of a disease are treated by [CONTACT_700016]. The constituents of specific combinations are selected on the basis of a 
genetic understanding of the specific disease molecular targets and the constituent’s pharmacological 
mechanisms of action. In this approach, doses of individual drugs are well below the range of the 
currently recommended human doses for their approved indications. 
As a first step in our drug discovery program, we performed a systematic analysis of available data to 
define a group of signalling pathways important for peripheral nerve structure and function affected in 
CMT1A disease. Among them, modular pathways known to affect myelin gene expression such as cAMP-
dependent mechanisms, neurosteroid signalling and the Akt/Erk pathway were of particular interest. 
We hypothesized that these modules are integrated as a unified system that is influenced by G protein 
coupled receptors (GPCRs) leading to the differential regulation of genes for peripheral myelin proteins. 
Since PMP22 is not only a structural component of myelin, but may have signalling functions in Schwann 
cells, its transcriptional control could be different from “classical” structural myelin genes such as MPZ . 
The topology of these putative regulatory networks permitted us to suggest that drugs acting on 
different GPCRs could cause a more potent and robust influence when combined. Thus, we have 
focused on the drugs able to modify relevant branches of GPCR signalling. This class of compounds is 
functionally acting on multiple pathways and is represented in approved Pharmacopeia. This allowed us 
to apply additional safety criteria for their selection. We also selected drugs which could be relevant for 
other aspects of peripheral nerve physiology that are affected in CMT1A, particularly drugs potentially 
promoting neuronal protection. This process was performed and allowed to select a lead compound: 
PXT3003 consists of a combination of very low doses of three substances (RS)-baclofen, naltrexone 
hydrochloride and D-sorbitol, which are thought to act in different ways in Schwann cells and neurons to 
limit the production of PMP22 in patients with CMT1A.  
Baclofen ([RS]-form) is a centrally acting skeletal muscle relaxant. It is indicated at doses up to 100-120 
mg/day (depending on the EU countries) to control spasticity and pain in people with multiple sclerosis 
and spi[INVESTIGATOR_195048]. As potent agonist of GABA-B receptors, baclofen is expected to negatively regulate 
the transcription of PMP22  gene in Schwann cells, most likely, via the cAMP-dependent silencer element 
(Magnaghi, Ballabio et al. , 2004; Magnaghi, Ballabio et al. , 2006).  
Naltrexone (N-cylopropylmethylnoroxymorphone) is a potent opi[INVESTIGATOR_699946]. Naltrexone blocks opi[INVESTIGATOR_699947]. In opi[INVESTIGATOR_699948], naltrexone administration at the approved 
therapeutic dose (i.e. up to 50 mg/day) has been associated with a predictable profile of serious adverse 
or untoward events. At very low doses (0.1 mg/kg), it was shown to raise endogenous endorphin release 
(Hytrek, McLaughlin et al. , 1996) and works also as a chemical chaperone and therefore, can increase 
cell surface targeting of cognate opi[INVESTIGATOR_8328] (Leskela, Markkanen et al. , 2007). Naltrexone is 
expected to potentiate canonical opi[INVESTIGATOR_699949] Gαi proteins and 
Study PLEO-CMT US - Protocol CLN-PXT3003-02, Version 1.4 dated 05th December 2017  
 
CONFIDENTIAL Page 25 / [ADDRESS_950336] of endogenous opi[INVESTIGATOR_699950]22, through a mechanism complementing and potentiating baclofen’s mechanism of action. 
Sorbitol (d-Sorbitol, glucitol) is a polyhydric alcohol with about half the sweetness of sucrose. Sorbitol 
occurs naturally and is also produced synthetically from glucose. It is used as a laxative (at doses up to 
15 g/day) and in irrigating solutions for some surgical procedures. It is also used in many manufacturing 
processes, as a pharmaceutical aid or excipi[INVESTIGATOR_841], and in several research applications. Sorbitol seems also 
to play an important role in peripheral nerve physiology (Maekawa, Tanimoto et al. , 2001) since it can 
bind with a high affinity (in the 1 µM range) to muscarinic receptors (Zhu and Li, 1999; Loreti, Vilaro et 
al., 2006) that play an important role in PMP22 expression and improve the folding of proteins (Howard, 
Fischer et al. , 2003; Kumar, 2009), the feature that is deficient in CMT neuropathy. D-sorbitol has been 
selected as a component of the fixed-dose combination product as regards to its potential ability to 
impact the expression of PMP22  gene and other aspects of CMT disease through mechanisms differing 
from those of baclofen and naltrexone. 
The combined actions of the three substances at low dose are expected to improve the function of the 
myelin sheath, improving signal transmission between nerve cells and relieving the symptoms of the 
disease as demonstrated in previous Pharnext in vitro  and in vivo  research studies (Chumakov, Milet et 
al., 2014).

6. [ADDRESS_950338]-in-human Phase II, randomized, double-blind, parallel-arm, 
multicenter, placebo-controlled study evaluating 3 different oral dose strengths of PXT3003 in adult 
outpatients, with CMT 1A (CLN-PXT3003-01) (Attarian, Vallat et al. , 2014).   
The primary objective of the study was to assess the clinical and laboratory safety and tolerability of the 
3 doses of PXT3003. The secondary objective was to obtain preliminary data on the efficacy outcome 
measures on clinical scores, functional tests and electrophysiological parameters although no formal 
calculation of sample size has been performed. 
Eighty patients aged 18-65 years with mild to moderate CMT1A confirmed by [CONTACT_37688][INVESTIGATOR_699951] (in the morning and in the 
evening) in a 1:1:1:1 ratio per oral administration Low-Dose (RS-baclofen 0.3 mg, naltrexone 
hydrochloride 0.035 mg, D-sorbitol 10.5 mg), Intermediate-Dose (RS-baclofen 0.6 mg, naltrexone 
hydrochloride 0.07 mg, D-sorbitol 21 mg)  or High-Dose (RS-baclofen 3 mg, naltrexone hydrochloride 
0.35 mg, D-sorbitol 105 mg) of PXT3003 (termed LD, ID and HD respectively in the following) or placebo 
during one year. Inclusion criteria included in particular CMTNS score of ≤ [ADDRESS_950339]-PXT3003-02, Version 1.4 dated 05th December 2017  
 
CONFIDENTIAL Page 26 / 79 The study met its primary endpoint that was to demonstrate the safety and tolerability of the 3 doses of 
PXT3003 administered twice daily over a year.  The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse effects 
(TEAEs) was similar across the 4 treatment arms (47% in the placebo arm, and respectively 23%, 33%, 
31% in the LD, ID, HD arms (P = 0.[ADDRESS_950340])) and the majority of related TEAEs were mild. 
TEAEs with a moderate severity were reported in only 3 patients: 2 in the HD arm (abdominal cramps 
and diarrhea; nausea), 1 in the ID arm (palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814]). Moreover, no relevant changes in vital signs, 
Electrocardiogram (ECG), or any of the chemistry or haematology test results were observed.  
The 3 doses of PXT3003 were shown to be safe as validated by [CONTACT_700017] (DMC) along the study and as reported in the Development Safety Update Report (DSUR) 
(29-Nov-2011 to 28-Nov-2012). 
Efficacy data of PXT3003 obtained from this phase II study on clinical scores, functional tests and 
electrophysiological parameters showed that the highest tested dose (HD) was effective compared to 
the other dose groups: for most of the efficacy outcomes, the best improvement was observed in the 
HD group. 
A step down search of the Minimum Effective dose identified the High Dose as the most promising dose. 
From there, the HD was considered as the effective dose and compared to the other groups considered 
together (termed ‘PLI’ in the following).  
The HD showed consistent evidence of modest improvement compared to placebo and the other doses, 
particularly on the two main clinical scores CMTNS and ONLS, with a significant improvement of 
respectively of 8% (P = 0.042; 90% CI: 0.4% - 16.2%) and 12.1% (P = 0.024; 90% CI: 2% - 23.2%) in the HD 
group versus the pool of all other groups, appearing to be the most sensitive clinical endpoints to 
treatment despi[INVESTIGATOR_699952]-stability over one year under placebo.  
The proportion of responders defined as patients not deteriorating at 12 months on the percentage of 
change from baseline averaged over the CMTNS and ONLS was also significantly higher in the HD group 
(79%; Relative Risk of 1.66, p = 0.01) compared to placebo and the other groups (all around 48%). 
Significant evidence of responders after only one year of treatment under High dose, with apparently 
less severe baseline characteristics, would suggest a possible ‘disease modifying’ effect for PXT3003. 
Among the secondary functional measures, 6MWT and Grip showed a trend of improvement in the HD 
group compared to the pool of all other groups. The cumulative contribution of PXT3003 to the 
improvement of functional measures was assessed through the significance of the O’Brien’s OLS test 
(O'Brien 1984) which confirmed a good improvement in the HD group when compared to the pool of all 
other groups (p = 0.051).  
At the electrophysiological level, myelin function assessed by [CONTACT_700018]: Distal Motor Latency was significantly decreased in the HD group when 
compared to Placebo (8% of improvement, p = 0.038), and Sensory Conduction Velocity was significantly 
increased when compared to Placebo (26.6% of improvement, p = 0.[ZIP_CODE]) and to the pool of all other 
groups (20.1% of improvement, p = 0.03). 
Albeit the therapeutic effect seems modest, it is striking that, over only one year, CMTNS and ONLS both 
improved from baseline under HD while these scores were not changed in patients under placebo. This 
might be explained by a functional improvement of dysmyelinated non degenerated axons, i.e. a 
decrease of axons suffering which would pair with a lower risk of degeneration. This is consistent with 
the putative mechanism of action of PXT3003 that may impact Schwann Cells function as it was shown 
to improve impaired myelination in PMP22 transgenic Rat treated after symptoms onset.   
This first-in human study demonstrated the good tolerability and safety of the [ADDRESS_950341] dose tested (HD) 
on the selected relevant clinical and electrophysiological outcome measures. This coherent set of data

CONFIDENTIAL Page 27 / [ADDRESS_950342] a possible ‘disease modifying’ effect for PXT3003. 
Consequently based on these considerations, a further clinical investigation with PXT3003 in a phase 3 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_699953] a wider population is justified and could provide confirmation 
of its efficacy and positive benefit-risk ratio and also additional insights on its mode of action. 
6. 5 PXT3003 Summary of the known and potential risks and benefits to human subjects 
PXT3003 consists of a combination of very low doses of three substances: (RS)-baclofen, naltrexone 
hydrochloride and D-sorbitol, which are thought to act in different ways to limit the production of 
PMP22 in patients with CMT 1A.  
The three substances are well established drugs/excipi[INVESTIGATOR_699954] 30 years at 
higher doses and in other indications:  
- baclofen  is approved in the treatment of spasticity resulting from diseases such as multiple 
sclerosis, with recommended dose of 20 mg t.i.d. to q.i.d., i.e. 60 to 80 mg/day, up to 120 mg/day 
maximum. In [LOCATION_009], baclofen is also currently tested in alcohol withdrawal, and can be prescribed 
under RTU conditions (Temporary Recommendation for Use on Off-label Baclofen) at doses up to 
300 mg/day. In PXT3003, baclofen is used at doses 1/5 to 1/10 of the recommended dose. 
- naltrexone  is approved in the treatment of alcohol or cocaine dependence with recommended 
dose of 50 mg/day.  In PXT3003, naltrexone is used at doses 1/35 of the recommended dose. 
- sorbitol  is used as excipi[INVESTIGATOR_699955] a 
recommended dose of 5 to 15 g/day. In PXT3003, sorbitol is used at doses 1/35 of the 
recommended dose. 
Safety profiles of baclofen and naltrexone in particular are well documented (Please refer to Investigator 
Brochure)   
Baclofen current product labelling in its approved indication for spasticity  specifies that, at the 
approved doses, it may cause transient drowsiness, dizziness, weakness, headache, seizures, nausea, 
vomiting, low blood pressure, constipation, confusion, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], depression, inability to sleep, and 
increased urinary frequency or urinary retention. Special warnings and precautions for use must be 
taken in severe psychiatric disorders, epi[INVESTIGATOR_699956], in patients already receiving 
antihypertensive therapy, suffering from cerebrovascular accidents or from respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], hepatic or renal 
impairment, with a history of peptic ulceration, with pre-existing sphincter hypertonia with risk of acute 
retention of urine, with liver diseases and elevated SGOT, alkaline phosphatase and with diabetes 
mellitus.  Baclofen is contraindicated in hypersensitivity to baclofen or any of the excipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], in patients 
with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance or Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose 
malabsorption, active peptic ulceration and porphyria.  
Consequently careful titration of dosage from [ADDRESS_950343]-PXT3003-02, Version 1.4 dated 05th December 2017  
 
CONFIDENTIAL Page 28 / [ADDRESS_950344] of alcohol and CNS depressants such as barbiturates, opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], 
benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_699957], hypnotics, neuroleptics, antihistamine H1 compounds, 
centrally acting antihypertensive drugs, sedative antidepressants. Baclofen may increase the side effects 
of levodopa (confusional state, agitation, hallucinations) and the antihypertensive effect of 
antihypertensive compounds.  Baclofen may induce increase hypotonia if co-administered with tricyclic 
antidepressants. 
However, taking in account the low doses of baclofen in PXT3003, the warnings described can be 
nuanced. 
Naltrexone current product labelling in its approved indication for opi[INVESTIGATOR_699958]; 
these can be minimized by [CONTACT_700019] a meal, and are not likely to occur at the low doses 
administered in PXT3003. 
Naltrexone is contraindicated in particular in patients with acute hepatitis or liver failure, currently 
dependent on opi[INVESTIGATOR_699959], who have demonstrated 
hypersensitivity to naltrexone hydrochloride and who have severe renal failure. 
In alcohol dependence, naltrexone even at high daily dose (much higher than the very low dose used in 
PXT3003) is considered as a safe medication. Control of liver values prior to initiation of treatment is 
however recommended, as naltrexone has been reported to induce dose-related hepatotoxicity. 
However, evidence of hepatotoxic risk has not been demonstrated at the doses usually recommended, 
and it should thus be of no relevance for the low doses administered in PXT3003. 
Sorbitol is used as an osmotic laxative  but is also naturally present in fruits and is widely used as a 
sweetener, a food additive and an excipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]. The main adverse effects of sorbitol when used as laxative 
at high doses are abdominal cramps, diarrhoea and catharsis. These adverse events should not be 
relevant at the doses employed in PXT3003. 
For each of these drugs, the FDA and the European regulatory bodies considered the risk/benefit ratio 
to be appropriate for the conditions specified on the labels. Pharnext is proposing the repositioning of 
these drugs in a different indication, CMT1A, a change that may impact the risk/benefit ratio that 
supported the original marketing applications.  However, as the dose of each drug used in the PXT3003 
compound was considerably lower than that currently used in their approved indications (5 to 35 times 
less), it was assumed that no meaningful alterations in the risk/benefit analysis could arise, particularly 
in support of an orphan disease indication with no alternative therapy available. Overall, the preclinical 
safety pharmacology and toxicology profile of the drugs suggested that their use was appropriate in 
other indications. 
The new fixed combination of low doses of the [ADDRESS_950345] (baclofen, naltrexone, sorbitol) used in 
PXT3003 and the good safety profile of the product as shown in the phase II clinical trial, we can 
consider the risk/benefit ratio of PXT3003 to be favourable. This consideration is again in favour of a 
further clinical investigation in a pi[INVESTIGATOR_699960]. 
Study PLEO-CMT US - Protocol CLN-PXT3003-02, Version 1.4 dated 05th December 2017  
 
CONFIDENTIAL Page 29 / [ADDRESS_950346] of the efficacy outcomes with one of the 3 doses tested compared to placebo, as 
well as the confirmation of its good tolerability and safety profile. 
Thereby, PXT3003 has demonstrated a substantial improvement on clinically significant endpoints and 
on electrophysiological markers, while also showing a good safety profile. PXT3003 induced an 
improvement beyond a stabilization of the disability suggesting a reversion of the disease progression.   
Based on these encouraging results, an orphan drug status was granted to PXT3003 in CMT1A by [CONTACT_700020] 2014, and Pharnext has decided to continue the development by 
[CONTACT_700021] a confirmative trial in a wider population. It will be a double blind, randomized, placebo-
controlled, parallel group pi[INVESTIGATOR_699961]/III study testing [ADDRESS_950347] beginning 
with this HD and then that a higher dose which could be the double of HD should be tested to maximize 
the potential for treatment benefit. 
Moreover, as there is no approved specific treatment in CMT1A, there is no active comparator to 
introduce, as usually done in such phase III clinical trial; placebo will then be used as control. PXT3003 or 
placebo will be given on top of standard cares. So, the study will combine a phase IIB for dose ranging 
and a Phase III as confirmative pi[INVESTIGATOR_2397]. 
The 2 tested doses will be then compared to placebo within 3 balanced groups randomized (1:1:1):  
 Dose 1,  corresponding to the highest dose (HD) from the previous phase II study, 
 Dose 2, a new dose with double amount of each active components of PXT3003 ( i.e., HD X 2),  
 Placebo.  
The first dose (Dose 1) corresponds to the highest dose found safe with preliminary evidence of efficacy 
in the phase II clinical study. Based on the “dose-effect” observed in this phase II study, and the 
increased effect among the [ADDRESS_950348] dose (HD: 3 
mg baclofen, 0.35 mg naltrexone and 105 mg sorbitol, given twice per day), it is assumed that a higher 
dose could also be tested as an additional dose for a further clinical trial.  
This additional dose is selected with the same ratio, based on an exploratory analysis of PK-PD 
relationship of the drugs and the improvement in the main endpoints, and taking into account the 
limitations regarding the baclofen dosage which should not be increased too much to guaranty the good 
tolerability, for safety reasons. Based on these considerations, a double dose (6 mg baclofen, 0.70 mg 
naltrexone and 210 mg sorbitol), i.e. two-fold of the HD as described previously, will be used twice daily 
in the proposed phase III study. This second dose, which has never been tested before and which is 
expected to be more active, will be tested independently as an additional dose. In order to improve 
baclofen tolerability, the dosage will be titrated by [CONTACT_700022]. Therefore the study should provide efficacy, safety and PK data on this additional higher 
dose.  
PXT3003 is a combination of [ADDRESS_950349]-PXT3003-02, Version 1.4 dated 05th December 2017  
 
CONFIDENTIAL Page 30 / [ADDRESS_950350] approval in the targeted indication.  
During a pre-IND meeting, the FDA advised to refer to the Guidance for Industry: Codevelopment of two 
or more new investigational drugs for use in combination, June [ADDRESS_950351] 
limited utility.  
This guidance also specifies that:  
“in some situations  an alternative design may be useful when the drugs in the combination cannot be 
administered as monotherapy, particularly: if in vitro studies, in vivo animal models, or phase [ADDRESS_950352] (e.g., because such testing would 
involve administering treatment known to be ineffective as monotherapy and it is not ethically 
feasible), then the contribution of the individual drugs do not need to be demonstrated using a 
factorial design.” 
These conditions are fulfilled by [CONTACT_700023]3003:    
- CMT1A is an orphan disease and a serious condition affecting the day-to-day quality of life of 
patients. 
- There is a strong biological rationale for use of the combination, e.g. the agents modulate distinct 
targets in the same molecular pathway. The three drugs baclofen, naltrexone and sorbitol were 
selected on the basis of bionetwork pharmacology, and are down-regulating PMP22 mRNA over-
expression. 
- The three drugs when used alone at the low doses proposed in the combination have limited or 
absent efficacy in CMT1A in vitro  and in vivo models, while the combination showed in vitro  its 
superiority to improve synergistically myelination and down-regulate PMP22 expression, and in 
vivo not only restored the functional behaviour of CMT1A transgenic rats, but also the behaviour of 
crushed mice synergistically  in contrast to single drugs that showed no effect individually. 
- Administering treatment known to be ineffective as monotherapy is not ethically feasible, 
particularly in a rare disease such as CMT1A which is slowly progressive and would need a long time 
of observation. 
This support the decision to test only the combination PXT3003 compared to placebo in the next clinical 
phase III. 
Moreover, PXT3003 will be administered on top of standard of care (SOC), consisting of supportive 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (authorized pain killers, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, and orthopedic devices) in an 
add-on design comparing the combination plus SOC to placebo plus SOC. 
The current clinical trial will be then a registration pi[INVESTIGATOR_699962], first the clinical 
efficacy of PXT3003 (primary objective) tested with [ADDRESS_950353] of clinician CMT experts; it is also in accordance 
Study PLEO-CMT US - Protocol CLN-PXT3003-02, Version 1.4 dated 05th December 2017  
 
CONFIDENTIAL Page 31 / 79 with the recommendations of both European and US Regulatory Agencies who provided scientific advise 
through the process of Protocol Assistance  for the EMA and Special Protocol Assessment  for the FDA. 
With this pi[INVESTIGATOR_2397], the final goal for Pharnext is to justify and support a claim for a Marketing 
Authorization Approval (MAA) for PXT3003 in the treatment of CMT1A.  
Considering the limitation to detect clinical changes within a short timeframe ( i.e. 12 months), 
particularly in a disease characterised by a slow progression, there is no consensus on the clinical 
primary and secondary efficacy endpoints to evaluate investigational drugs in CMT1A. In the absence of 
FDA or EMA guidance relative to this specific disease, Pharnext initially referred to the only known 
recommendations on this disease published by [CONTACT_941] 136th ENMC International Workshop: Charcot Marie 
Tooth Disease Type 1A – 8-10 April 2005 (Reilly, de Jonghe et al. , 2006), and suggested using both the 
CMTNS and the ONLS as co-primary endpoints in order to assess the effect of PXT3003 on disease 
impairment and disability. 
Concerns were raised by [CONTACT_700024]/EMA on the poor sensitivity to change of CMTNS. In their 
recommendation to propose a primary endpoint assessing clinically meaningful differences, they 
provided reluctance for proposals based on composite z-score combining CMTNS and ONLS, arguing the 
possibility of global statistical significance whereas at least one of the endpoints should not have a 
clinically meaningful effect. 
In parallel, the FDA expressed concern about CMTNS. While it is commonly used to assess disease 
severity, CMTNS may not be appropriate to evaluate the potential clinical benefit of a drug given that it 
is a composite score based on patient signs, symptoms and neurophysiological measures, with 
potentially different meanings and interpretation. The FDA advised to select a primary endpoint more 
directly related with drug benefit: in particular ONLS might be more appropriate as a specific disability 
estimate with functional scale grades for legs and arms.  
The other usual endpoints will be used as secondary endpoints and they will be hierarchized as clinical, 
functional, electrophysiological and other exploratory endpoints. Secondary endpoints should be 
ordered in a hierarchical manner with statistical adjustment for multiplicity. 
Out of these points, both agencies endorsed the proposed study population, the choice of doses and the 
key points of the design. 
Therefore, if this single pi[INVESTIGATOR_699963], it should be 
sufficient to support the marketing application of PXT3003 in the treatment of CMT1A adult patients.

8.1 Trial Objectives 
The primary objective of this double-blind study is to assess the efficacy of two doses of PXT3003 
compared to Placebo on the disability measured by [CONTACT_700025]1A patients treated 
for 15 months 
 
The Secondary objectives are to assess: 
- The efficacy of two doses of PXT3003 compared to Placebo on other outcomes such as 
impairment clinical score (CMTNS-V2), functional tests (Walking test, QMT, Nine Hole-Peg test), 
electrophysiological parameters and measures of quality of life.  
- The safety and tolerability of two doses of PXT3003 compared to Placebo;  
- PK parameters of PXT3003 components (baclofen, naltrexone and 6β-naltrexol) in the 2 tested 
dosages of PXT3003; 
- The change over time of potential blood biomarkers;  
- Molecular changes in skin biopsy, when this procedure will be possible (ancillary sub-study); 
- And new potential imaging biomarkers by [CONTACT_700001], when this procedure will be possible 
(ancillary sub-study & centralized reading). 
8.[ADDRESS_950354] 300 patients  presenting a diagnosis of CMT1A, 
genetically proven, of mild to moderate severity (assessed by [CONTACT_700002]-V2 score between 2 and 18), with

8.4 Study endpoints 
8.4.1 Efficacy endpoints 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Primary efficacy endpoint 
The primary efficacy endpoint will be the main effect of the studied treatment on the improvement of 
disability measured by [CONTACT_700003] (ONLS) score, summarized at 12 and 15 
months defined by: [CONTACT_700026]-baseline measures at [ADDRESS_950355]-PXT3003-02, Version 1.4 dated 05th December 2017  
 
CONFIDENTIAL Page 33 / 79 Considering that ONLS is the preferred assessment method of disability, a clinically relevant endpoint in 
CMT1A, and that it has recently been shown to be more sensitive to change than CMTNS, ONLS is 
selected as primary endpoint. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Secondary efficacy endpoints 
In the context of an orphan disease, when there are no ideal endpoints, it might be acceptable to assess 
multiple endpoints and to observe their outcomes. However, they have been selected according to our 
experience from the previous phase 2 study, and they are hierarchized as following: 
- Responders Rate to PXT3003 therapy defined as a patients improving on ONLS at end of treatment. 
- Clinical and functional tests:

[IP_ADDRESS]  Discussion on the choice of the efficacy endpoints 
A. ONLS is a disability scale that was derived and improved from the Overall Disability Sum Score by 
(Graham and Hughes, 2006) to measure limitations in the everyday activities of the upper limbs (rated in 
5 points) and the lower limbs (rated on 7 points) (See Appendix II). The total score goes from 0 (= no 
disability) to 12 (= maximum disability). Although the functioning of patients with peripheral neuropathy 
may be influenced by [CONTACT_700027], ONLS measures the perceived 
ability of the patient to move and fulfil normal life, and thus expected to be associated with Quality of 
Life. It was initially validated in a pool of 100 patients with diverse peripheral neuropathies (mainly of 
dysimmune origin but including 9 CMT patients, 11 patients with chronic idiopathic axonal 
polyneuropathy, and 13 patients with paraprotein-associated demyelinating neuropathy): it showed 
significant relationships with measures of impairment, disability and quality of life.  
The 136th ENMC Workshop agreed in recommending the ONLS as the core disability scale for CMT1A 
trials (Reilly, de Jonghe et al. , 2006), and it reliability was subsequently further validated in 40 CMT 
patients (Solari, Laura et al. , 2008). 
Study PLEO-CMT US - Protocol CLN-PXT3003-02, Version 1.4 dated 05th December 2017  
 
CONFIDENTIAL Page 34 / [ADDRESS_950356] tested Acid Ascorbic (a phase 
II randomized placebo-controlled trial performed at three hospi[INVESTIGATOR_699964] 2005 to 
October 2008 on 180 patients (Micallef, Attarian et al. , 2009)), and the second was conducted 5 years 
later, testing PXT3003 (a Phase II placebo-controlled trial performed at six hospi[INVESTIGATOR_699965] 
2010 to November 2012 on 80 patients (Attarian, Dubourg et al. , 2013)). During the five years between 
the two assessments, no modification on CMTNS, Charcot-Marie-Tooth Examination Score (CMTES) or 
motor and sensitive amplitudes were reported, while a significant increase of ONLS score was noticed. It 
is known that CMT1A is a progressive neurodegenerative disease and the natural progression of the 
disability during the [ADDRESS_950357] assessment method of disability, a clinically relevant endpoint in 
CMT1A, and it has been recently shown to be more sensitive to change than the CMTNS, the ONLS is 
selected as primary endpoint. 
B. CMTNS is a specific scale designed to assess severity of impairment in CMT disease (Shy, 2005). 
Although not completely validated, it provides a single and reliable measure of CMT severity. It is a 36-
point scale based on 9 items: 5 of them quantify impairment (sensory symptoms, pin sensibility, 
vibration, arm and leg strength), 2 activity limitations (motor symptoms arms and legs) and 2 
electrophysiological data (amplitudes of ulnar Compound Muscle Action Potential [CMAP] and Sensory 
Nerve Action Potential [SNAP]). Increased scores indicate a worsening of the function: the scores 
categorize a disability as mild (0-10), moderate (11-20) and severe (21-36). 
While CMTNS score is commonly used to assess disease severity, it may be problematic to evaluate the 
potential clinical benefit of a drug; as it is a composite score based on patient signs, symptoms, and on 
electrophysiological data with potentially very different meanings and interpretations, an objective 
analysis may be difficult. 
Nevertheless, CMTNS is an accepted measure of CMT severity, but its sensitivity to change is debated 
(Reilly, Shy et al. , 2010). Some CMTNS components are apparently not sensitive enough, and 
floor/ceiling effects do occur. For instance, if the patient had surgery (fixation of the ankle), the ‘motor 
leg symptoms’ definitively score 3; so, it is not possible to get a decrease of the score whatever it 
happens. The usefulness of the SNAP component was also judged to be limited as it is frequently absent 
in CMT1A patients which receive the maximum score on their entry visit, thus has a low sensitivity to 
change. (Komyathy, Neal et al. , 2013) pointed out that sensory and motor symptoms items result from 
subjective opi[INVESTIGATOR_699966], concerning their leg and arm strengths and loss of sensation in their 
legs, and that pin sensibility, vibration and strength are based on a neurological examination which 
depends on patient cooperation and examiner consistency to obtain reproducible results. Finally, some 
measurement of the CMTNS, such as SNAP or vibratory sensation, may decrease normally with age; 
thus, scores could increase slightly as age for reasons independent of CMT (Shy, 2005). 
A modified version 2 (CMTNS-v2) was issued in 2011 (Murphy, Herrmann et al. , 2011) to attempt to 
reduce floor and ceiling effects and to standardize patient assessment. This CMTNSv2 has not yet been 
tested in longitudinal studies, but it has still limitations to detect change as recently shown through a 
Rasch analysis, leading to the conclusion that “there is no current perfect outcome instrument for CMT” 
(Sadjadi, Reilly et al. , 2014). 
More recently, an analysis by [CONTACT_700028]1A trials and their 
contribution towards discrimination of disease severity including the 9 components of CMTNS score and 
6 additional functional outcomes. Among them, only 5 items /9 of CMTNS score and 3 functional 
outcomes (10m timed walking test, [ADDRESS_950358] and foot dorsal flexion dynamometry) were selected 
as discriminant to assess severity (Mannil, Solari et al. , 2014).   
Study PLEO-CMT US - Protocol CLN-PXT3003-02, Version 1.4 dated 05th December 2017  
 
CONFIDENTIAL Page 35 / 79 Although the CMTNS sensitivity in detecting the effects of a therapeutic intervention has never been 
demonstrated, it remains the only CMT-specific outcome measure (although not specific to CMT1A) and 
it was used as a primary outcome in main Ascorbic Acid clinical trials (Micallef, Attarian et al. , 2009; 
Pareyson, Reilly et al. , 2011; Lewis, McDermott et al. , 2013). Given the uncertainties regarding its 
sensitivity and the clinical meaningfulness of the effects that might be detected, it is proposed to use 
CMTNS-v2 as a secondary endpoint.  
C. Nine-Hole Peg Test (9-HPT)  performed on non-dominant hand 
The 9-HPT is a simple timed test of fine motor coordination of extremities in the upper limbs. It 
measures the lag time needed by [CONTACT_700029] 
(normal required time being 18 seconds).  
9-HPT can be considered, at least, as an impairment measurement, although not directly measuring 
disability functions. In this regard, aggregating this test with other impairment/disability functions may 
take sense.  
Restraining 9-HPT performed on the non-dominant hand is justified by [CONTACT_700030], or 
compensatory mechanisms so the non-dominant 9-HPT is considered as a more specific measure of 
intrinsic CMT related status.   
9-HPT has been widely used for acute and chronic acquired dysimmune neuropathies or for Parkinson’s 
disease and recently in CMT clinical trials. Intra and inter-rater reliabilities were tested in 40 CMT 
patients by (Solari, Laura et al., 2008) and were found to be excellent. But the sensitivity to change was 
not assessed, needing longitudinal studies. 
Currently used in multiple sclerosis as a motor deficit measurement, 9-HPT involves strength (distal and 
proximal) and proprioception (sensory); thus, it gives information concerning proximal and distal 
parameters. 
D. Hand grip Quantified Muscular Testing (QMT) and Foot dorsiflexion QMT performed on both sides 
QMT is used to evaluate motor strength in CMT1A (Hogrel, Payan et al.,  2007; Shy, Chen et al., 2008; 
Payan, Hogrel et al. , 2009). QMT testing bilaterally ankle dorsiflexion and handgrip was successfully used 
in previous CMT1A clinical trial testing AA. 
The QMT has been successfully used to evaluate motor strength in fascio-scapulo-humeral myopathy 
and CMT1A (Micallef, Attarian et al. , 2009) in comparison to healthy control subjects. The following 
muscles will be evaluated as previously described: tibialis anterior (right and left) and hand grip (right 
and left). The best value on three consecutive and reproducible tests will be collected in the CRF for 
each muscle. Before the study, all examiners will attend training sessions and a separate technical 
document will detail the techniques and materials to be used for these evaluations. 
Impairment of the muscular strength measured by [CONTACT_700031] a 
strong variability inter-judges and inter-patients, while foot dorsiflexion is non-assessable if the patient 
had surgery of the ankle. So, we expect more variability of the measures on the feet than on the hands.  
The sum of motor strength + handgrip on both hands might constitute the a priori  best justified 
aggregate measure. Foot dorsi-flexion will be also assessed on both sides. 
These measures are considered as impairment, and not as disability. We can guess that the developed 
muscular strength is one direct result of the muscular power and is rather dependent on amplitudes. 
 
Study PLEO-CMT US - Protocol CLN-PXT3003-02, Version 1.4 dated 05th December 2017  
 
CONFIDENTIAL Page 36 / [ADDRESS_950359] (10mWT)  
The walking tests are expected to be partly correlated with ONLS, CMTNS and QMT. However, in the 
previous clinical trials, 6-Minutes Walking Test (6-MWT) was used, but a clear training effect was shown 
along the successive visits in all groups, with no difference with the placebo group so that finally it does 
not seem to be relevant to evaluate CMT disease. The 6-MWT is time consuming and requires a large 
space to be practiced.   
Better than an endurance test on a long distance, most of the interviewed experts prefer to test the 
speed to walk on a small distance as the limited dorsiflexion in CMT induces walk impairment 
particularly at start. The time to walk10 meters is proposed.  
The 10m WT is simple to administer, standardized, reliable and valid evaluation of functional exercise 
capacity and gait that has been proven reliable in neurologic disorders (Watson, 2002; Tyson and 
Connell, 2009) and in CMT patients (Solari, Laura et al. , 2008). Results recorded are the time to walk [ADDRESS_950360] is 
sensitive to fatigue related changes and to ankle status (walk ability may be modified if orthese or 
surgery) and it correlates with established outcome measures. However it only reflects the ability to 
walk [ADDRESS_950361] is expected to be 
partly correlated with ONLS, CMTNS and QMT. 
F. Electrophysiological parameters  
Sensory and motor responses measured at ulnar and radial nerves on the non-dominant side: 
 Compound Muscle Action Potential (CMAP) on ulnar nerve 
 Sensory Nerve Action Potential (SNAP) on radial nerve 
 Nerve Conduction Velocity (NCV) 
For CMT, it is usual to measure motor and sensory amplitudes of one nerve (ulnar is recommended for 
CMAP and radial for SNAP in the modified CMTNS version 2).  
CMAP appears as weakly reliable since affected by [CONTACT_700032]-dependent. NCV is a more reliable measure since relatively unaffected by [CONTACT_700033].  
CMAP measures conduction of nerve impulses better than the conduction velocities that are affected in 
CMT1A since a very early age. An improvement of the patient requires an increase of the CMAP. 
However, electrophysiological parameters are measured on more or less severely impaired and atrophic 
distal muscles, but it is well recognized that an improvement usually first appears in the less affected 
proximal parts. Consequently and in our context, the sensitivity of the CMAP remains limited. The same 
applies for NCV, but it is the CMAP that prevails. 
Sensory measures (SNAP and SCV) are less reliable than motor ones due to their very high sensitivity to 
electrodes positioning. SNAP is affected by [CONTACT_700034]-dermal 
tissue thickness (~obesity). Moreover, in CMT1A, amplitudes are close to zero, so that conduction 
velocity is not measurable. These values are of a limited use. Finally, as missing value of SNAP might be a 
characteristic of severity, disregarding missing values for severe patients, and using for other patients 
may introduce a bias. Under a given threshold, amplitudes disappear as they stand below the lower 
level of detection or are measured on highly altered fibers; this anomaly can also be related to other 
non-specific factors, such as lesions of the skin). This ‘grey zone’ does not correspond to a zero but 
certainly to a very low value difficult to measure.

CONFIDENTIAL Page 37 / [ADDRESS_950362], electrophysiological measures on the sciatic nerve would represent an ideal 
alternative, but technical constraints are not well controlled.  
In conclusion, electrophysiological parameters may provide pharmacodynamics information on the 
nerve integrity (Schwann cells and axons) in the distal part of the arm. CMAP on ulnar nerve and SNAP 
on radial nerve will be measured to fulfil the CMTNS modified version 2 items. 
G. Quality of life (QoL) assessments 
 EuroQol 5-Dimensional Health-related Quality of Life scale (EQ-5D) 
Quality of life endpoints should describe to which extent the disease is limiting life activities and impacts 
the overall Quality of Life or Well-being. So far, no such scale has been used, and no validated specific 
QoL scale has been used in CMT disease. In some AA trials, Short Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36) was 
used, but it did not show significant results. SF-36 is a quality of life questionnaire that was initially 
designed as a cardiovascular disease assessment. The questionnaire is very long to administer and 
questions are not usually well adapted to the impairment observed in peripheral neuropathies. The 
investigators of the phase II trial advised to withdraw this questionnaire for the phase III study and to 
choose an easier one: the EuroQol 5-Dimensional Health-related Quality of Life scale (EQ-5D) is short 
and easy to administer even if it is not validated specifically in CTM disease. 
 VAS on self-assessment of the individualized main impairment in daily activities defined at baseline 
with the patient 
VAS will be used for an individualized self-assessment by [CONTACT_700035]/his main impairment in daily 
activities which will be defined at baseline; it will be re-evaluated with the patient at each visit of the 
follow-up (See Appendix 5).  
In CMT no patient-reported outcome has been validated today. In recognition of the importance of 
patient input we intend to test such a new instrument, even if it is subjective that may provide 
information on the patient perception.   
 
8.4.2 Safety endpoints 
Safety and tolerability of PXT3003 will be compared to placebo on the following parameters: 
o Incidence of Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs); they will be evaluated by 
[CONTACT_24975]/nature, severity/intensity, seriousness, duration, relationship to study drug, and outcome; 
o Incidence of related TEAEs (including possibly and probably related TEAEs) with a moderate or 
severe intensity; 
o Incidence of AE leading to withdrawal of study drug; 
o Incidence of Serious Adverse Events (SAEs); 
o Changes in physical examination, vital signs (blood pressure and and heart rate), 12-lead ECG, 
and laboratory data (hematology and blood chemistry).

8.4.3 Other exploratory endpoints 
[IP_ADDRESS]  PXT3003 components plasma concentration 
Plasma concentrations of baclofen, naltrexone and 6ß-naltrexol, PXT3003 components will be dosed on 
blood samples performed (on lithium heparinised tubes) at inclusion visit and at 6-month (V3), 12-
month (V5) and 15-month (V6) visits to determine PK parameters of the 2 tested doses. 
Blood samples will be performed at through (i.e. pre-dose in the morning) and at peak (i.e. 90 minutes 
after drug administration), and they will be stored at -80°C and analyzed in the central laboratory (Bertin 
Pharma, Orleans, [LOCATION_009]). 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Blood biomarkers, gene expression analyses and DNA sequencing 
Plasma samples for biomarkers identification will be performed at inclusion visit and at 6-month (V3), 
12-month (V5) and 15-month (V6) visits, and they will be stored at -80°C.  
This exploratory work on biomarkers should be considered only for research purposes and not as data 
that have to be delivered to patients or to health authorities at the end of this Phase III.  
Pharnext has identified potential blood biomarkers (Tryptophan, Alanine, Serotonin, Thyroxin (T4), and 
free cholesterol) in the previous phase II that need to be confirmed in this phase III.  
Meanwhile, other markers could be assessed for quantification studies, and thus identified later after 
the accomplishment of this clinical trial. On the other hand, from the same drawn samples, leucocytes 
will be isolated for gene expression studies (microarrays and PCRs).  
Leucocytes will be isolated from an additional sample drawn at the inclusion visit only in order to realize 
DNA sequencing for all included patients after they have given their written informed consent for 
research purposes. One of the purposes of genome sequencing could be to advance the understanding 
CMT1A disease for the research community in general. It should be possible to identify genes that could 
change in response to PXT3003 treatment, which could confer them the property of pharmacodynamics 
candidates. Furthermore, gene expression analysis could be very valuable for the study of mechanisms 
occurring in CMT1A, which has never been performed before with such blood samples. For Instance, 
novel mutations in CMT1A patients, excluding those of CMT, could be discovered and associated with 
various mechanisms underlying the mildness or severity of the disease. On the other hand, correlations 
of sequencing data with clinical scores and endpoints are also relevant for the study of the 
pharmacodynamics of PXT3003 for a future potential development of personalized medicine. To this 
end, it is of interest to get benefit from such clinical studies as the one described here in this protocol to 
perform DNA sequencing because CMT1A patients are rare, which could substantially contribute to the 
improvement of the field. For these reasons, this sequencing study should be considered only for

end of this Phase III. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Biomolecular changes in skin biopsy (Optional ancillary sub-study)  
Volunteer centers that agree to perform skin biopsies (according to their interest, available equipment 
and resources) will participate to this ancillary sub-study to assess candidate genes (biomarkers) by 
[CONTACT_700036]-qPCR technics. Candidate genes will be selected based on ongoing assessments and 
analyses of skin biopsies derived from Phase II CMT1A patients and from other CMT1A cohorts 
generated by [CONTACT_699998]. This exploratory study aims to identify genes that could change in response to 
PXT3003 treatment, which could confer them the property of pharmacodynamics candidates. 
Furthermore, gene expression analysis could be very valuable for the study of mechanisms occurring in 
CMT1A, which has never been performed before with such skin biopsy samples. Skin biopsies are of 
great value because of their rarity. This is why we would like to take the benefit of the Phase III trial to 
access these samples for research purposes.  
One small punch biopsy will be performed at the ankle level of one leg at the inclusion visit (V1) and at 
the end of the treatment at the 15-month visit (V6). Separate protocol will define the methodology. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  MRI of  leg to assess muscle/fat index  (Optional ancillary sub-study) 
MRI is a method to identify areas of muscle atrophy and fatty infiltration in the legs that are hallmarks of 
disease severity and are due to the progressive degeneration of axons without concomitant re-
innervation, resulting in progressive denervation of muscle. Del Porto et al.  (2010) showed in CMT that 
changes in MRI signal intensity, reflecting muscle atrophy and fatty infiltration, are associated with 
changes in dorsiflexion strength and areas of acute denervation processes or injury. MRI shows areas 
where muscle has been replaced by [CONTACT_108160], a process which occurs in neuropathies. 
MRI of the leg will be performed at baseline and at the end of the study (Visit 6). In particular for 
example the anterior muscle compartment responsible for foot dorsiflexion (tibialis anterior, extensor 
hallucis longus, extensor digitorum longus and peroneus tertius) (del Porto, Nicholson et al. , 2010).. 
Short Tau Inversion Recovery images will be acquired in the axial plane to delineate these structures and 
to assess changes in signal intensity as an indicator for acute denervation and/or possible injury 
(Gallardo, Garcia et al., 2006).   
The MRI examination will look for signal intensity alterations including muscle edema, fatty infiltration, 
and abnormal contrast enhancement. Increase of T1 signal intensity in the muscle belly due to fatty 
infiltration will be estimated in a semi-quantitative way, according to the Goutallier’s classification 
(Schiefer, Mendonca et al. , 2015). 
A specific technical manual will be written separately to ensure the standardization of MRI acquisition 
across all sites, and centralized reading will be organized.

during the [ADDRESS_950374] weeks and will then be increased to the full dose (5ml of the liquid formulation) twice 
a day until the end of study treatment. 
Patients randomized to PXT3003 will be supplied with the appropriate number of disposable glass 
bottles and carton boxes specifically labelled for the use in the study where required by [CONTACT_1295]. 
These will be dispensed at baseline, and every three months (e.g. 3 carton boxes of 4 bottles for 3 
months).  
10.2 Treatment packaging and labelling 
Study treatments (PXT3003 and placebo) will be manufactured by [CONTACT_539147] ([LOCATION_006]), then after 
importation in [LOCATION_009], packed, labelled/certified for clinical trial use, and shipped by [CONTACT_700040] 
([LOCATION_009]) to the sites pharmacies in accordance with applicable regulations, e.g. with the current GMP 
guidelines, ICH Guidelines Good Clinical Practice (ICH E6), and with the local laws and regulations. 
Study treatments (PXT3003 and matching placebo) will be provided in carton boxes of [ADDRESS_950375]-PXT3003-02, Version 1.4 dated 05th December 2017  
 
CONFIDENTIAL Page 43 / 79 Labelling will comply with applicable rules and regulations. The study treatment will be labelled with the 
following information (in local language):  
• Name, address and telephone number of sponsor  
• Pharmaceutical dosage form  
• Route of administration  
• Quantity of dosage units  
• Batch and/or code number to identify the contents and packaging operation 
• A trial reference code allowing identification of the trial  
• Treatment number

10.3 Management of study treatment 
Study treatments (PXT3003 and placebo) will be supplied by [CONTACT_700040], [LOCATION_009]. Treatments will 
be shipped to the pharmacy at the Investigator’s site. 
The pharmacist or investigator will be provided with all the necessary documents required concerning 
information on PXT3003, according to the Good Clinic Practice (GCP) (ICH topic E6 and local regulations). 
The hospi[INVESTIGATOR_699970] (reception, storage, dispensation log, update of the delivery list, return of empty 
packaging and unused units and return of study treatment to the sponsor). As soon as treatment units 
are received on site, the pharmacist or investigator will return the enclosed acknowledgement of receipt 
sheet to a PHARNEXT representative which is filled-in and signed. Study treatments under the 
pharmacist’s or investigator’s responsibility have to be stored in a secure limited access area, in 
accordance with required storage conditions, and their whereabouts disclosed only to persons 
authorised to have access to this storage room.   
In accordance with GCP regulations (ICH topic E6 and local regulations) all study materials (unused 
treatment units, packaging) have to be returned by [CONTACT_700041]. The attestation of return will indicate for each patient:  
 date of study treatment reception and quantity,  
 number of administered and unused therapeutic units,  
 number of undelivered units,  
 number of therapeutic units finally returned and dispatch date. 
In case of a therapeutic unit loss, the investigator or the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]’s Pharmacist in charge of the treatment 
management will have to justify this loss in a written statement, signed and dated and enclosed with the 
attestation of return.  
The unused therapeutic units will be retrieved by [CONTACT_700042] (i.e. after the final 
study report signature) and after the reconciliation of the dispensation log of the therapeutic units.

The study drugs should be stored in a refrigerator at controlled temperature between +2°C and +8°C.  
The shelf-life for PXT3003 is 36 months in refrigerated conditions (+2 to +8°C).  
However the data generated so far support transportation at ambient temperature : in order to handle

tolerated for a total time of no more than [ADDRESS_950377] be kept in a refrigerator at a temperature of +2°C to +8°C  and can 
be used for up to 10 days . 
10.5 Dispensing and drug accountability 
The study treatment will be dispensed only under restricted conditions as defined in the present 
protocol. Once the eligibility of the patient is confirmed by [CONTACT_093] (all inclusion and exclusion 
criteria checked), patients will be assigned a randomization number  according to the randomization 
process in the interactive web randomization system ( IWRS ) and dispensed a corresponding study drug 
kit. 
The treatment will be dispensed only by [CONTACT_700043]/hers direct supervision or the 
pharmacist. Adequate records on receipt, dispensation, initials of the person dispensing the drug, use, 
return, loss, or other disposition of medication must be maintained. These records include dates, 
quantities, batch numbers, expi[INVESTIGATOR_1659], subject identification (initials) and the unique code 
numbers assigned to the study patients. 
Patients will receive at each visit the necessary quantity of treatment until the subsequent one 
(including extra bottle(s) to cover for a potential delay [+/- one week] in study visits or any problem of 
study drug conservation). This will correspond to [ADDRESS_950378] visit 
(at 15 months).  
Study drugs must only be used for the study purpose and must not be used outside this protocol.  
Patients should return empty and partially emptied or unused bottles  to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_699971] (a) new kit(s).  
At each visit the compliance/adherence to the treatment will be investigated: details of the quantities of 
bottles of medication dispensed and the count of used bottles returned will be recorded at each visit to 
report the compliance. 
The patients will be asked whether the investigational treatment was taken as prescribed. If not, any 
change in the treatment and the number of forgotten intakes will be recorded. In addition, the number 
of quantities will be counted and compared to the theoretical quantities. Any mismatch will be 
investigated and justified in collaboration with the patient if possible.     
Patients should be instructed to store study medication in the refrigerator  (both unused and opened 
bottles). However, transportation from the investigator’s site to the patient’s home can be done at 
ambient temperature (<30°C) . 
During use, opened bottles  containing the study medication will be stored in a refrigerator for a 
maximum duration of [ADDRESS_950379] be avoided: It necessary to avoid storing carton boxes or 
glass bottles against the walls of the refrigerator.  
The storage conditions in the refrigerator does not allow to include several patients of the same family 
under the same roof and using the same refrigerator, which justifies the exclusion criterion No. [ADDRESS_950380]-PXT3003-02, Version 1.4 dated 05th December 2017

them may live far from the reference center, so the number of visits is limited.  
The study will be conducted on a  total of 15 months  with evaluations visits at baseline (screening and 
randomization visit), 6 months, 12 months and 15 months.  
Intermediate visits are scheduled at 3 months and 9 months for drug dispensation and checking safety 
(AEs) and treatment compliance. Eventually if local regulations allow that the dispensing of medication 
can be organized by [CONTACT_11675][INVESTIGATOR_007], these intermediate visits at 3 months and 9 months may be made by 
[CONTACT_25600].  
Visits are scheduled as following: 
 V0 - Screening visit:       Day-1 to Day -30 max 
 V1 -   Randomization visit:      at Day 0  
 V2 -   3-month visit (or telephone call):   at Day 90 ± 8 Days 
 V3 -  6-month visit:     at Day 180 ± 10 Days 
 V4 -   9-month visit (or telephone call):   at Day 270 ± 10 Days 
 V5 -  12-month visit:      at Day 360 ± 10 Days 
 V6 -  15-month visit:     at Day 450 ± 10 Days 
If one visit date is changed (anticipated or delayed), the next visit should occur according to the original 
schedule. 
All visits must be performed by [CONTACT_700044]-investigators qualified for this study and who are 
expert in the management of CMT1A patients.

The following procedures/assessments will be performed at the screening period within 30 days prior to 
inclusion: 
 Obtaining the informed consent  
Patients who meet all inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria will be informed about the study. If a 
patient is eligible to be enrolled in the study, the investigator should give to the patient the study’s 
informed consent form and orally present all necessary information to the patient, in order to enable 
him to make an informed but uncoerced decision about participating in the study. Objectives,

In case of children 16 to 18 year-old age, both parent’s and children’s consents should be collected. 
 IVRS/IWRS notification 
The IWRS through eCRF will be used at V0 for notification of screening and patient number allocation. 
First demographic information and the date of signature [CONTACT_700084].  
In case of rescreening, a new patient number will be assigned by [CONTACT_8784].  
In case of screening failure, the site will have to record it via IWRS at V1 (baseline) and to report the 
reason. 
The patient number is composed of a 7-digit number containing the 2-digit country code, the 2-digit 
center code and the 3-digit patient chronological number (which is [ADDRESS_950385] patient screened).  
 Laboratory testing by [CONTACT_700045] V0 and measured at the central laboratory are needed for checking 
the exclusion criteria. If any of the laboratory parameters are not available upon the end of the 
screening period (e.g., sample material damaged during transport etc.) a retest can be performed. 
 Assessment of inclusion/exclusion criteria  
The following information must be collected and documented in the CRF within the screening period: 
- Patient history of CMT1A with documented genetic diagnosis  should be noted in the source 
document;  
- If not already documented, blood sampling (4 ml) for the PMP22 duplication genetic test will 
be performed.  
- Patient history of all the treatments including surgery, physiotherapy and medications must be 
notified in the source documentation prior randomization (with regimen, duration, and 
complications and their treatments); 
- Demographics characteristics (age, gender, and ethnic origin); 
- Physical examination including vital signs (SBP and DBP, heart rate), body height and weight; 
- Physical and neurological examinations with the presence of weakness at dorsiflexion;  
- Electrophysiological tests of sensory and motor responses of ulnar and radial nerves on the non-
dominant side (including CMAP, SNAP, NCV, and DML parameters) will be performed to determine 
the CMTNS score; 
- 12-lead ECG (sent for centralized reading by a cardiologist); 
- Results of safety laboratory tests from the central laboratory; 
- Authorized and prohibited concomitant medications.

CONFIDENTIAL Page 51 / 79 11.6 Study discontinuation 
11.6.1  Criteria for terminating the trial 
Pharnext reserves the right to terminate the study but intends only to exercise this right for valid 
scientific or administrative reasons and reasons related to protection of patients. In all cases the Ethics 
Committee (IRB/IEC) and Health Authorities should be informed. Possible reasons for the study 
termination can include, but are not limited to; 
 the discovery of an unexpected, significant or unacceptable risk to patients enrolled in the study 
 a decision on the part of Pharnext to suspend or discontinue the development of the investigational 
product 
 request by [CONTACT_700048] 
 decision of the DSMB 
If the study is prematurely discontinued then enrolled patients should be called for an “end of study 
visit” 
11.6.2  Criteria for terminating a site 
Pharnext reserves the right to terminate the study at a given site at any time after the study initiation 
should any of the followings occur: 
• ICH GCP regulations have not been observed, 
• the protocol has been violated without justification, 
• the data generated are of poor quality, 
• changes in personnel or facilities adversely affect performance of the study (e.g. low 
rate of inclusion). 
11.7 Follow up extension study 
At the end of the study, patients having completed the study will be eligible to receive PXT3003 in a 9-
month follow-up extension trial , since upon the investigator’s judgement they are likely to benefit from 
use of the medication and if they are willing to prolong their participation in the trial.  
The follow-up study will be defined by a separate protocol , a new information about this second study 
will be delivered to the patient, and he will have to provide a new written informed consent.  
All the patients randomized to Dose1 or Dose 2 of PXT3003 in this primary study will continue the 
extension study at the same dose, while patients receiving placebo will be assigned to one of the two 
doses according to 1:[ADDRESS_950400], this extension study will stimulate the recruitment in the primary 15-month study by [CONTACT_700049]. 
Second, it will provide additional long-term data (up to 2 years) on safety and efficacy in double blind 
design with delayed start for placebo group switched to active dosages of PXT3003 that may provide 
some evidence of disease modifying effect.  
From V1.4: adapted section as follows 
Patients who completed this 15-month study or who were prematurely discontinued from the PXT3003 dose [ADDRESS_950401]-PXT3003-02, Version 1.4 dated 05th December 2017  
 
CONFIDENTIAL Page 52 / 79 Patients previously assigned to dose 2 PXT3003 will receive the equivalent of dose 2 (i.e. 5 mL per 
administration), by [CONTACT_699995], i.e. twice the dose 1 PXT3003 (2x5 mL, i.e. 10 mL per 
administration) in the study CLN-PXT3003-03.    
Patients previously assigned to dose [ADDRESS_950402] completed the pi[INVESTIGATOR_699974] 1 PXT3003 (5 mL) in the study CLN-PXT3003-03. 
Hence the protocol of extension study has been amended to assign all placebo patients to dose 1 IMP 
only, whereas patients previously assigned to dose 1 IMP will continue to do so. As a consequence of 
the difference of IMP volume (i.e. 5 mL and 10 mL) to be administered the study has become an open-
label study that no longer randomizes patients to study treatment. 
12. SAFETY ASSESSMENTS AND REPORTING 
12.1 Adverse Events 
12.1.1   Definitions 
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events (AEs) 
The term Adverse Event  covers any sign, symptom, syndrome, or illness which appears or worsens in a 
patient during the observation period of the clinical study and which may impact upon the patient’s 
well-being.  
The AE reporting period therefore starts with the patient signing the Informed Consent Form and ends 
one month after the last administration of study drug. Events occurring during the drug-free and pre- 
and post-treatment periods should also be designated as adverse events.  
The term also covers laboratory findings or results of other diagnostic procedures which are considered 
to be clinically relevant (e.g, that require unscheduled diagnostic procedures or/and treatment 
measures or result in withdrawal from the study). 
An adverse event may be:  
• a new illness,  
• the worsening of a sign or symptom of the condition under treatment or of a concomitant illness,  
• an effect of the study medication,  
• a combination of two or more of these factors. 
No causal relationship with the study medication or with the clinical study itself is implied by [CONTACT_571978] “Adverse Event.”  
Vital signs and ECG abnormalities, abnormal laboratory values, showing significant shifts from baseline 
that the investigator considers to be clinically significant, have to be reported as Adverse Event (If there 
are symptomatic and/or requiring either corrective treatment or consultation, and/or leading to IMP 
discontinuation or modification of dosing, or fulfilling a seriousness criteria). 
Surgical procedures themselves are not adverse events; they are therapeutic measures for conditions 
that require surgery. The condition, for which surgery is required, may be an adverse event, if it occurs 
or is detected during the study period. Planned surgical measures permitted by [CONTACT_700050](s) leading to these measures are not adverse events, if the condition(s) was 
(were) known before the patient signs the informed consent. In the latter case, the condition should be 
reported as medical history.

CONFIDENTIAL Page 53 / 79  
[IP_ADDRESS] Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) 
A treatment-emergent adverse event is defined as any event not present prior to the initiation of the 
study treatment, or any event already present which worsens either in intensity or frequency following 
the exposure to the study treatment.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) 
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
- results in death; 
- is life-threatening 1, 
- requires patient’s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 2, 
- results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity 3, 
- is a congenital anomaly/birth defect; 
- is medically important 4. 
1 “Life-threatening” means that the patient is at immediate risk of death at the time of the serious 
adverse event; it does not refer to a serious adverse event that hypothetically might have caused death 
if it was more severe. 
2'Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] ' is defined as inpatient care that covers more than one calendar day. 
3 “Persistent or significant disability or incapacity”  means that there is a substantial disruption of a 
person’s ability to carry out normal life functions. 
[ADDRESS_950403] of critical terms ([ADDRESS_950404]) should be used as guidance for adverse events that 
may be considered serious because they are medically important.  
Cases involving cancer as an Adverse Event should be reported as “serious” using the criterion 
“medically important” if no other serious criterion is met.  
  
[IP_ADDRESS] SAE waived from expedited regulatory reporting to regulatory authorities 
For the purpose of the study the following events will not be designated as a serious adverse event 
(SAE): 
- hospi[INVESTIGATOR_699975] a part of the normal planned treatment or monitoring of the studied indication 
and not associated with any deterioration in condition, 
- hospi[INVESTIGATOR_699976], 
- admission for diagnostic evaluation of an AE, 
- overnight hospi[INVESTIGATOR_699977]. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Clarification of the difference in meaning between “severe” and “serious”  
The terms “severe” and “serious” are not synonymous:  
Study PLEO-CMT US - Protocol CLN-PXT3003-02, Version 1.4 dated 05th December 2017  
 
CONFIDENTIAL Page 54 / 79   “serious”  is based on patient/event outcome  or action criteria usually associated with events 
that pose a threat to a patient’s life or functioning. “Seriousness” (not severity) serves as a guide for 
defining regulatory reporting obligations. 
 "severe"  is used to describe the severity e.g. intensity of a specific event, which could be rated 
mild, moderate or severe . The event itself, however, may be of relatively minor medical significance 
(such as severe headache).  
12.1.[ADDRESS_950405] be recorded 
in the patient’s medical records and in the CRF . For each adverse event, the reported term, onset and 
end dates, severity, consequences on study drug intake (action taken), relationship to study drug, 
outcome and information on seriousness of the event will be recorded.  
The severity, the relationship to the study drug and the outcome of the adverse event will be assessed 
by [CONTACT_093]. 
 The severity (intensity) of each AE must be assessed according to the following classification: 
- Mild:  does not interfere with routine activities, 
- Moderate:  interferes with routine activities, 
- Severe:  patient is unable to perform routine activities.  
 The relationship of any adverse effect to the study drug must be assessed according to the 
following rating:   
- Unrelated /unlikely : clearly and incontrovertibly due only to extraneous causes and does not 
meet criteria listed under possibly or likely related. 
- Possibly / probably related : follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the 
study intervention, follows a known or expected response pattern to the suspected intervention, 
but that could readily have been produced by a number of other factors. 
- Related : clearly related to the investigational agent or the studied procedure, i.e. an event that 
follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the study intervention, follows a 
known or expected response pattern to the suspected intervention, which can be confirmed by [CONTACT_700051][INVESTIGATOR_699978]’s clinical state. 
 The outcome  of each AE must be assessed according to the following classification: 
- Ongoing *: the AE has not resolved, 
- Recovering:  improvement in the patient’s condition has occurred, but the patient still has some 
residual effects, 
- Recovered without sequelae:  the patient has fully recovered with no observable residual effects, 
- Recovered with sequelae **: the AE has resulted in a permanent impairment   
- Death:  the patient died due to the AE,  
- Unknown:  the outcome of the AE is not known because the patient did not return for follow-up 
(lost to follow-up), 
* If an AE is still on-going at the last visit, the patient must be followed up until the outcome can be 
documented without using “on-going” in the assessment.

In order to ensure the safety of the patients, the investigator should take appropriate measures to 
follow all AEs until clinical recovery is complete and laboratory results have returned to normal, or until 
progression has been stabilized, or until death. This may imply that observations will continue beyond 
the last planned visit per protocol, and that additional investigations may be requested by [CONTACT_700052].

immediately or within 24 hours)  of becoming aware of the event to the global pharmacovigilance 
representatives of the sponsor. The investigator must inform the site monitor. The initial notification 
must be followed within additional [ADDRESS_950407] be reported within the same timelines. 
After the initial report, the SAE should be promptly described in a detailed written report including all 
data allowing the event to be documented and using only the anonymous copi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (with only the subject 
identification code: treatment number and initials) from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_699979](s). The investigator should also report all elements concerning the follow-up of 
the SAE.  
When reporting a death, the investigator should supply any additional requested information such as 
autopsy reports (if available) and final medical reports. 
The "Serious Adverse Event" form  and the instructions on completion are provided in the investigator’s 
study file. The “Instructions for Completing the SAE Form” give more detailed guidance on the reporting 
of SAEs, significant overdose cases, and AEs initially reported as non-serious which become serious. 
The Global Pharmacovigilance Representative of the Sponsor will forward any SAE initial and/or follow-
up notification/report to Pharnext to the attention of the Chief Medical Officer within one working day, 
and will also ensure compliance with all regulatory reporting requirements and notify the authorities, 
ethics committees and investigators as appropriate. All safety reporting responsibilities, timelines and 
procedures will be in detail described in study specific Safety Management Plan. 
12.1.4  Follow-up of Adverse Events 
Patients experiencing adverse events will be monitored with relevant clinical assessments and 
laboratory tests prescribed by [CONTACT_1963]. The investigator will ensure that follow-up includes 
any supplemental investigations that might be necessary to investigate the nature and/or causality of 
the AE/SAE. 
All adverse events (including SAEs) must be followed until satisfactory resolution or stabilization. 
Any measure taken and follow-up result must be recorded in the patient's CRF, as well as in the patient’s 
source document. Follow-up laboratory results should be filed with the patient’s source documentation. 
12.2 Vital signs 
Vital signs including systolic and diastolic blood pressures (measured in supi[INVESTIGATOR_55848] [ADDRESS_950408]) and heart rate will be measured at each visit. Body weight will be measured only at the screening. 
Measurements will be recorded in the e-CRF.

CONFIDENTIAL Page 56 / 79 12.3  Physical examination 
A complete physical examination will be performed at the screening visit (V0) and at each visit for the 
purpose of observing the patient's overall appearance, general health and behaviour. The examination 
includes cardiovascular, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], abdominal, neurological, locomotive and dermatologic systems. 
Any significant abnormalities should be recorded in the eCRF. 
12.4  Electrocardiogram (ECG) 
An ECG will be performed at the screening visit (V0) and at the end of the single blind treatment (V6 or 
at early withdrawal visit) using the internationally recognised 12-lead ECG recording which includes 
date, time, initials of the technician/nurse, initials of the investigator or their deputy, at least [ADDRESS_950409] of the 
Cardiograph paper print-outs that should be kept in the file and a copy should be provided to Pharnext 
(sent to centralized reading center). Main ECG parameters including heart rate, sinusal rhythm PR, QRS, 
QT and QTc interval will be analysed by a cardiologist in the central reading center.  
12.[ADDRESS_950410] should be performed at screening visit (V0), at 6-month (V3), 12-month (V5) and 
15-month (V6) visits, or at early withdrawal visit.  
The following blood parameters should be evaluated:  
 hematology : red blood cell count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelet count (absolute), white blood 
cell count and white blood cell count differential 
 biochemistry tests  (serum/plasma): Sodium (Na), Potassium (K), Chloride (Cl), Gamma-glutamyl-
transpeptidase ( GT), Alanine aminotransferase (ALAT), Aspartate aminotransferase (ASAT), 
Alkaline phosphatases, Urea, Creatinine, Total Bilirubin and Blood glucose. 
Standard blood tests (including pregnancy test at screening and last treatment visit) will require 12 ml of 
blood at each sampling  (screening, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months and final follow-up visit (see Study 
Flow chart).  
Laboratory examinations will not be repeated at the inclusion visit if already performed at screening

13.  OTHER EXPLORATORY ASSESSMENTS 
13.1 Plasma level of PXT3003 components 
Blood sampling for PK (around 5 mL twice) will be performed before drug administration (trough) and 90 
minutes after (peak) at baseline (V1), and at 6-month (V3), 12-month (V5) and 15-month (V6) visits. 
Pharmacokinetic analysis will require 10 ml of blood to be withdrawn at each point.  
Peak and trough levels of baclofen, naltrexone and 6ß-naltrexol  will be measured using a validated LC-
MS/MS method developed by [CONTACT_700056], [LOCATION_009].  
Sorbitol will not be dosed for technical reasons: first it is a natural sugar and it is difficult to discriminate 
between plasma levels of PXT3003-derived sorbitol and sorbitol from other (e.g. dietary) origins, and 
second after IV injection D-sorbitol plasma levels are measurable for only 10 minutes.  
Complete information on blood sampling, conditions of preparation and storage (-80°C) as well as 
shipment details for PK and Central laboratory contact [CONTACT_700057] a separate technical 
brochure provided by [CONTACT_2237]. 
13.2 Blood Biomarkers gene expression analyses and DNA sequencing 
Blood sampling for biomarkers (around 10mL) will be performed at the inclusion (V1) and at 6-month 
(V3), 12-month (V5) and 15-month (V6) visits for a total of [ADDRESS_950415] been selected (tryptophan, alanin, serotonin, T4 and free 
cholesterol), first through a pi[INVESTIGATOR_699980]22 rats versus Wild Type Sprague Dawley rats. The phase II 
conducted in humans provided confirmation of the interest of these biomarkers, particularly 
tryptophan, alanine and free cholesterol. Moreover other markers could be assessed for quantification 
studies, and thus identified later after the accomplishment of this clinical trial.  
An additional blood sample (5mL) will be drawn at the inclusion visit only to collect leucocytes in order 
to realize DNA sequencing for research purposes.

CONFIDENTIAL Page 58 / 79 Complete information on blood sampling, conditions of preparation and storage (-80°C) as well as 
shipment details for these samples will be supplied in a separate technical brochure. 
13.3 Skin biopsy (optional ancillary sub-study) 
Some investigating site will perform skin biopsies. A specific processing protocol will be provided. 
Skin biopsy is a minimally invasive procedure that is used mainly in the evaluation of non-myelinated 
nerve fibres in sensory neuropathies. Recent data suggested that skin biopsy may replace, under certain 
circumstances, the more invasive sural nerve biopsy in the morphological and molecular evaluation of 
inherited and other demyelinating neuropathies (Li, Bai et al ., 2005; Katona, Wu et al ., 2009; Saporta, 
Katona  et al.,  2009). 
A skin biopsy consisting in one small punch biopsy (3 mm of diameter) at the lateral calf 10 cm above 
the lateral malleolus will be performed before treatment at baseline (V1) and after treatment (V6) to all 
patients randomized in the site that are engaged in this sub-study . This will allow to assess mRNA levels 
of PMP22 and other putative candidates biomarkers as exploratory pharmacodynamic endpoints of the 
present study. Complete information on sampling, conditions of preparation and storage as well as 
shipment details and laboratory contact [CONTACT_700057] a separate technical brochure. 
13.4  Leg MRI   (optional ancillary sub-study)  
Some investigating sites will participate in an optional ancillary sub-study  leg MRI for research purpose 
on potential new imaging biomarkers.   Legs MRI will be conducted at Baseline and the end of the study. 
A specific processing protocol will be provided separately to ensure the standardisation of the MRI 
acquisition across all sites, and centralized reading will be organized. 
14.  STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
14.1 Analysis sets 
The Full Analysis Set (FAS)  will be constituted by [CONTACT_700058]. 
The Per-Protocol (PP)  population will include all the patients of the FAS without major protocol violation 
during the course of the study. 
All the efficacy analyses will be conducted on the FAS population and reproduced on the PP population 
for sensitivity purposes. The safety analyses will be conducted on the FAS, given that all randomized 
patients will receive at least one dose of treatment. 
14.[ADDRESS_950416] compared with Placebo will be tested by [CONTACT_638179] (ANCOVA) on the summary mean of ONLS at 12 and 15 months adjusted for baseline ONLS 
values. ANCOVA will be featured by a Linear Mixed Model (LMM), including baseline ONLS values and 
treatment as fixed factors, and center as random effect. The use of two repeated post-baseline 
measures increases the power to detect treatment differences in mean levels of the outcome measure 
over time (Frison and Pocock, 1992; Morgan and Case, 2013). 
Two active doses will be compared to Placebo. As the monotonicity of dose effect is not assumed, each 
dose will be compared at a two-sided 2.5% significance level, in order to preserve an overall false-
positive rate of 5%.

CONFIDENTIAL Page 59 / [ADDRESS_950417]-baseline measures, a linear correlation coefficient of ONLS of R = 0.[ADDRESS_950418] deviation of ONLS of SD  ≅ 1, and a negligible 
between center standard deviation (estimated SD = 0.13 [0;0.35]), the resulting adjusted standard 
deviation ASD  ≅ [1*(1-.752)].5 ≅ 0.65, thus a minimum clinically relevant difference in ONLS should be a 
Cohen’s Δ of 0.65/2 ≅ 0.325, rounded to  Δ = 0.3. From calculations based on compound symmetry of 
the covariance matrix (Frison and Pocock, 1992, Morgan and Case, 2013), such a difference should be 
detected versus Placebo with a power of 90% at a two-sided 2.5% significance level when the sample 
size reaches at least 89 patients per group. Assuming a drop-out rate of  ≅ 10%, we anticipate recruiting 
[ADDRESS_950419] 300 patients. 
The parameters needed for sample size calculation were evaluated based on historical trials (Micallef, 
Attarian et al. , 2009; Pareyson, Reilly  et al. , 2011; Attarian, Vallat et al. , 2014).  
14.4 Secondary efficacy analyses  
The primary ANCOVA analysis based on the summary mean at 12 and 15 months will be repeated on the 
other quantitative efficacy endpoints (see above). The significance of the treatment effect on each 
quantitative endpoint will also be evaluated based on the difference compared to Placebo in change 
from baseline at each individual visit and in slope of progression over the duration of the study. The 
proportion of responders at 15 months will be assessed through a Generalized Linear Mixed Model 
(GLMM) featuring logistic regression, and admitting center as a random effect. Secondary analyses will 
be conducted at a two-sided 5% significance level. 
14.[ADDRESS_950420] of missing data on the study’s 
conclusions will be evaluated. Descriptive data analyses will allow assessing the pattern of missing data, 
including reasons for drop-outs in each treatment group. In addition, sensitivity analyses will be 
conducted by [CONTACT_700059] (further details in the SAP). 
For any patient experiencing early trial interruption, an early interruption visit is planned. It will be 
checked if this visit took place within a given time frame where the next regular visit would have been 
planned. In case the early interruption visit occurs within this time frame, data of the early interruption 
visit will be shifted to the next regular visit for all analyses. In case the early interruption visit does not 
occur within this time frame, the data of the early interruption visit will not be included in any of the 
inferential analyses. 
14.6 Safety analyses  
Safety and tolerability will be assessed by [CONTACT_643919] (AEs), change in 
physical examination, vital signs, electrocardiogram (ECG) and laboratory data. 
The incidence of Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), related AEs (including possibly and 
probably related AEs) with moderate or severe intensity, AEs leading to withdrawal of study drug, and 
Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) will be summarized by [CONTACT_6660]. This summary will show

CONFIDENTIAL Page 60 / 79 incidence rates (number and percentage of patients) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals. 
Moreover, 95% confidence intervals for the difference in incidence rates between each group will be 
calculated. 
Changes in physical examination, vital signs (blood pressure and heart rate) and ECG will be analyzed 
descriptively. 
Changes from baseline to the end of the treatment period in laboratory values for hematology and 
blood chemistry will be summarized descriptively. Each laboratory value will be flagged to show 
whether it lies within, below, or above the normal range. The proportion of subjects with values in each 
of these categories at each assessment will be also summarized. 
14.[ADDRESS_950421] (DSMB) 
An independent DSMB will regularly follow the progress of the clinical trial, monitor safety data and 
critical efficacy variables, and be consulted concerning the opportunity of modifying the sample size or 
terminate the trial for futility. 
14.[ADDRESS_950422] deviation (SD) and the correlation 
between baseline and final values ( R). Over- or under- estimation is possible due to their wide spread 
variation. An estimation of the adjusted standard deviation ASD will be performed when 80 patients are 
available, producing a 95% half interval length of ASD±0.1. In case where the absolute value of the 
difference between the observed ASD and the value used for initial sample size calculation exceeds 0.1, 
the sample size will be recalculated. In addition, the drop-out rate of 10% used for sample size 
calculation will be also updated if its estimation on the first 100 patients is significantly greater and non-
related to safety concerns. The adaptive sample size calculation will be organized blind to treatment and 
do not require any type-I adjustment.  
14.9 Futility analysis  
A one–stage Futility stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_699942], probability to detect a significant 
result at the end of the study, given the results observed at an intermediate time. Conditional Power 
(CP) will be estimated through B-values and (Lan and Wittes, 1988; Lan and Zucker, 1993). This analysis 
will be carried out by a third party statistician when at least 100 patients are available, and futility 
threshold  will be CP min = 0.10 involving a slight increase of type 2 error (β = 0.1/0.9 = 0.111-0.10 ≅ 0.01) 
(Proschan, 1999). This intermediate futility analysis does not require any type-I adjustment, this trial 
does not plan g rejection of the null hypothesis before its end. 
Further details will be described in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) as appropriate. 
15.  ETHICS AND LEGAL CONSIDERATIONS 
15.1 Declaration of Helsinki and conformity with other international standards

the protocol, the ICH Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice (ICH E6), the European directives on clinical 
trials (Directive 2001/20/EC) and the applicable local country laws/regulations.  
15.2 Ethics Committee / Institutional Review Board Approval 
The final study protocol, including the Patient Information and Informed Consent, will be submitted for 
approval to the appropriate Ethics Committee (EC) or Institutional Review Board (IRB). Any amendment 
to these documents will be also submitted to the EC/IRB. In case the protocol amendment changes the 
scope of the study or increases the risks of the study patients, the investigator should wait for approval 
of this amendment by [CONTACT_1383]/IRB before implementing the protocol amendment. A copy of the written 
approval and the approved versions of the documents and a list of the EC/IRB members, their titles and 
occupations should be forwarded to the responsible study personnel. The written approval should 
identify the study and document the date of review. All correspondences with the EC/IRB and forward 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_699981].  
15.[ADDRESS_950423] give notice of any emergency deviation and 
justification for the deviation of the study to the personnel responsible for the sponsor and the EC/IRB, 
as quickly as possible after the epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], in any event no later than 24 hours after the emergency.  
15.4 Patient Informed Consent procedure 
It is the responsibility of the investigator to give to each patient (or the patient’s legally authorized 
representative) prior to inclusion in the study, full and adequate verbal and written information about 
the objectives and the procedures of the study, potential risks involved and personal and societal 
benefits. The patients must be informed about their right to withdraw from the study at any time and 
for any reason, without sanction, penalty, or loss of benefits to which they are otherwise entitled and 
that withdrawal from the study will not jeopardize their future medical care. Before deciding on 
whether or not to participate, the patient should have sufficient time to think about the study and to 
discuss the study with a third party if necessary. The investigators and their staff will be available to 
answer questions from the subject at any time. Written information (Patient information and informed 
consent form) should be given to each patient before enrolment. Furthermore, it is the responsibility of 
the investigator to obtain, in accordance with the pertinent local regulations, a signed “Informed 
Consent Form” from each patient (or the patient’s legally authorized representative) prior to performing 
any study-related procedures.  
The Patient Information and Informed Consent form should be updated or amended whenever new 
important information that may be relevant to the patient, becomes available. Modifications to these 
documents must be approved by [CONTACT_700061]/IRB before being implemented.  
15.[ADDRESS_950424] be documented in a protocol amendment. Such protocol amendments 
will be made jointly by [CONTACT_700062]. Both parties will sign the protocol 
amendment.  
The investigators will submit the protocol amendment for review by [CONTACT_700063]/IRB if the 
change or deviation from the original protocol could increase the risks to the studied patients, or could

approval from the independent EC/IRB before such change(s) or deviation are implemented.  
If the change(s) or deviation to the original protocol eliminate or reduce the risk to the study patients, 
the protocol amendment can be implemented before approval has been received from the independent 
EC/IRB. In such cases, the investigators will notify the independent EC/IRB within ten working days after 
implementation and will submit the protocol amendment as soon as possible for 
information/favourable opi[INVESTIGATOR_699982]/IRB.  
If the protocol amendment is of the administrative kind, it will be sent to the EC/IRB for information.  
16. QUALITY CONTROLE AND QUALITY ASSURANCE 
16.[ADDRESS_950426] access to source data/documents 
In conformity with GCP (ICH E6), the investigator should provide direct access to source data/documents 
for trial-related monitoring, audits, IRB/IEC review and regulatory inspection. Any authorized party with 
direct access should take all reasonable precautions within the constraints of the applicable regulatory 
requirement(s), to maintain the confidentiality of subject’s identities and sponsor’s proprietary 
information. 
Each patient should consent in writing to allow direct access to his/her original medical records.  
16.2 Monitoring and Good Clinical Practice 
The trial will be run in accordance with Good Clinical Practice, following international regulations (ICH) 
and European directives (EMEA) or national ones.  
The sponsor will delegate the monitoring of the study to a contract research organization (CRO). 
Monitoring will be done by [CONTACT_782] a representative of the CRO who will review the case 
report against source documents and will ensure that the investigation is conducted according to the 
protocol design, applicable Standard Operating Procedures and regulatory requirements. 
At any moment quality control of the study and Good Clinical Practice audit can be performed by [CONTACT_229306] a delegated auditor or by [CONTACT_700064].  
In particular, the current protocol will be submitted, by [CONTACT_456], to the Ethics Committee 
/Institutional Review Board and the Competent Authority, in order to secure their agreements as is 
required by [CONTACT_12212]. The conformity of the study progress will be reviewed.  
The investigator will carefully explain the participating conditions to each proposed patient. Each patient 
will receive a detailed and written information letter which will include the name [CONTACT_700085], a summary of its properties, the potential occurrence of unexpected and adverse events, the 
doses to be administered, the treatment duration, the number of visits and the type and number of 
scheduled exams.  
The patient will be informed that he can withdraw from the study whenever he/she wants without 
providing any justification. The investigator will be available by [CONTACT_700065]/she has 
included. 
The system to attribute treatment numbers to patients respects the obligation of anonymity. Patients 
will receive a number according to their order of inclusion in the study on a site. The patients will be 
identified by [CONTACT_127422]: the site number and the inclusion number. 
Study PLEO-CMT US - Protocol CLN-PXT3003-02, Version 1.4 dated 05th December 2017  
 
CONFIDENTIAL Page 63 / 79 Study progress conformity to the protocol will be monitored from the beginning, starting from the 
patient’s selection and continuing throughout the entire study. Each investigator has to allow access to 
patient’s medical file and source documentation (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_699983], consultation file, results of 
additional examinations, etc…) to the monitor, or sponsor’s delegated representative, that have to 
monitor the progress of the study and to check source documents in order to monitor data reported in 
the CRFs. The anonymity of the patient will be respected when filling-in the CRF along, with any other 
archived documents considered as source data (blood tests, informed consent form, etc.). 
16.3 Monitoring visits 
The monitors (Clinical Research Associates representative of the CRO)  who are delegates of the 
sponsor will conduct site initiation visits  at each study site, after approval of the study has been 
obtained from the independent EC/IRB and Competent Authorities in order to discuss with the 
investigator the clinical protocol and review data collection procedures, safety monitoring and reporting 
procedures and regulatory requirements.  
Monitoring visits  to the study sites will be conducted periodically during the clinical study in order to:  
 review the status of the study with respect to patient enrolment, occurrence of adverse events, etc… 
 ensure that the clinical investigators continue to respect their contractual, clinical and regulatory 
obligations with regard to protocol compliance (and compliance to protocol amendments, if 
applicable), adherence to regulatory and ethical requirements and the protection of the patients’ 
rights and safety, 
 ensure the scientific integrity of the study by [CONTACT_700066], 
 review the completeness and accuracy of the study site records, 
Source documents will be reviewed for verification of agreement with data in the CRFs. The study site 
will guarantee direct access to source documents by [CONTACT_700067]. Monitoring will be conducted according to internal Standard 
Operating Procedures.  
The study may also be subject to a quality insurance audit by [CONTACT_154986], as well as 
inspection by [CONTACT_4708]. 
It is important that the investigator and the relevant study personnel are available during the 
monitoring visits and possible audits and that sufficient time is devoted to these processes.

The original documents generated in the course of the study will be inspected at each step of the study, 
both by [CONTACT_456]’s representative and the investigator, in order to guarantee the accuracy of the 
analysed data.  
The conduct of the study may be audited either by [CONTACT_700069]. Auditors should have access to any study records (CRFs, site files, trial master files, 
etc.) and source patient’s medical documentation, being understood that these personnel is bound by 
[CONTACT_56520], and as such will not disclose any personal identity or personal medical information. 
Investigators accept the possibility to be audited and agree to dedicate necessary time to the proper 
conduct of the audit at their sites. This will facilitate the process of ensuring that study is being run in 
conformity with the protocol and with current rules and regulations.  
17.  DATA HANDLING

investigator will retain a copy of all completed case report form pages. 
The informed consent form will include a statement by [CONTACT_206395]’s duly 
authorized personnel, the Ethics Committee (IRB/IEC), and the regulatory authorities to have direct 
access to original medical records which support the data on the e-CRFs (e.g., patient's medical file, 
appointment books, original laboratory records, etc.). These personnel, bound by [CONTACT_56520], 
must maintain the confidentiality of all personal identity or personal medical information (according to 
confidentiality and personal data protection rules). 
 
It is the responsibility of the investigator to maintain adequate and accurate e-CRFs (according to the 
technology used), designed by [CONTACT_206397] (according to sponsor instructions) all observations 
and other data pertinent to the clinical investigation in a timely manner. All e-CRFs should be completed 
in their entirety in a neat, legible manner to ensure accurate interpretation of data. Should a correction 
be made, the corrected information will be entered in the e-CRF overwriting the initial information. An 
audit trail allows identifying the modification.  
Data are available within the system to the sponsor as soon as they are entered in the e-CRF. 
The computerized handling of the data by [CONTACT_700071] e-CRF may generate 
queries to which the Investigator is obliged to respond by [CONTACT_19130]. 
The queries with their responses will be managed through the e-CRF. 
17.[ADDRESS_950429] the study number, the center number, the patient’s study number and the 
randomization number in the study.  
Source data relate to but are not limited to: 
Subject demographic data (age, weight, height, and birth’s date), general examination, medical history, 
last participation to a clinical trial if any, 
 CMT type 1A genetic diagnosis, history of the disease,   
 Current and previous treatments for CMT1A and any other types of treatment, 
 Dates and times for drug administration, concomitant medication(s) during the study, 
 All data related to efficacy assessment: ONLS, CMTNS, functional tests (QMT, 9-HPT, Walking 
tests, EQ5D, VAS, electrophysiological parameters),

archived: the investigator’s file containing all required GCP documents, including signed Informed 
Consent forms and patient-related records, and copy of the e-CRFs. The investigator and the site should 
retain  records at least 15 years  after the completion or discontinuation of the clinical trial. If the 
investigator's personal situation is such that archiving can no longer be ensured by [CONTACT_12552]/her, the 
investigator shall inform the sponsor and the relevant records shall be transferred to a mutually agreed 
upon designee. The investigator must notify the sponsor prior to destroy any study essential documents 
following the clinical trial completion or discontinuation.  
These documents must be available for inspection by [CONTACT_700072]. Audits may be performed for quality insurance of data handling. 
17.4 Data protection  
The data collected in this study will only be used for the purpose(s) of the study and to document the 
evaluation of the benefit/ risk ratio, efficacy and safety of the tested product PXT3003.  
The patient's personal data, which are included in the sponsor database, shall be treated in compliance 
with all applicable laws and regulations. When archiving or processing personal data pertaining to the 
investigator and/or to the patients, the sponsor shall take all appropriate measures to safeguard and 
prevent access to this data by [CONTACT_13159]. 
The sponsor also collects specific data regarding investigator as well as personal data, from any person 
involved in the study which may be included in the sponsor’s databases, shall be treated by [CONTACT_700073]. 
Subject race or ethnicity will be collected in this study. Differences in response to medical products have 
already been observed in racially and ethnically distinct subgroups of the U.S. population. These 
differences may be attributable to intrinsic factors (e.g., genetics, metabolism, elimination), extrinsic 
factors (e.g., diet, environmental exposure, sociocultural issues), or interactions between these factors. 
Race and ethnicity information will be collected according to the FDA Guidance for Industry - Collection 
of Race and Ethnicity Data in Clinical Trials (2005) , and in accordance of local laws in the different 
participating countries. 
17.5 Confidentiality and property rights

CONFIDENTIAL Page 73 / [ADDRESS_950436] OF NON -RECOMMENDED TREATMENTS FOR CMT1A  PATIENTS  
 
 Baclofen  (Liorésal®), naltrexone  (Nalorex®, Revia®) sorbitol  (pharmaceutical form, such 
as sorbitol Delalande®, Hépargitol®, Microlax®, Schoum®...) and ascorbic acid  (vitamin 
C®, Laroscorbine®...), as they may interfere with study treatment evaluation. 
 Levothyroxin  (Levothyrox®, L-Thyroxin serb®) as it may confound biomarkers analysis. 
 Opi[INVESTIGATOR_2467]  (morphine, fentanyl, hydromorphone, oxycodone, buprenorphine, 
nalbuphine, Lamaline® and tramadol – including Ixprim®, Topalgic®, Contramal® and 
Zaldiar®) and other drugs of the opi[INVESTIGATOR_699987]. 
 Codeine  is allowed only at doses of ≤ 20 mg per unit dose; analgesics such as Efferalgan 
Codeine® are therefore not allowed as they contain 30 mg codeine per unit dose. 
 Levodopa  (Sinemet®, Modopar®, Stalevo®...) should not be used as in combination with 
baclofen there may be increased adverse effects such as confusion, agitation and 
hallucinations. 
 Centrally acting antihypertensive drugs such as clonidine  (Catapressan®), 
methyldopa  (Aldomet®), moxonidine (Physiotens®), and  rilmenidine  (Hyperium®), as 
baclofen may increase their antihypertensive effect (risk of hypotension).  
 Other classes of antihypertensive compounds are allowed, but physicians should be aware 
of a potential increased antihypertensive effect on combined treatment with baclofen. 
 Potent central nervous system (CNS) depressants such as barbiturates, 
benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], and neuroleptics  are not allowed because of potential increase in side 
effects in association with baclofen.   
 Clonazepam  (Rivotril®) can however be used at low daily doses (≤ 20 drops/day, i.e. 2 
mg/day).  
 Treatments that may induce or aggravate peripheral neuropathies are also forbidden during 
the trial, such as the antiepi[INVESTIGATOR_699988]  (Di-Hydan®) and anticancer drugs 
such as vincristine, vinblastine, cisplatine, carboplatine, oxaliplatine, taxol. 
 Antiepi[INVESTIGATOR_699989] (Depakine® or Depakote®), carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050] 
(Tegretol®), oxcarbazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (Trileptal®), gabapentine  (Neurontin®), pregabaline 
(Lyrica®) can be used but should be maintained at constant doses throughout the trial.  
 Antidepressant drugs  including imipraminic antidepressants  can be used, but they 
should be maintained at constant doses throughout the trial, as imipraminic antidepressant 
can potentiate the hypotonia induced by [CONTACT_62265], and sedative antidepressants may 
potentiate CNS depression. 
 Drugs which could induce neuropathies:  
 Anti-cancer drugs: vincristine, vinblastine, cisplatine, carboplatine, paclitaxel; 
 Anti-infectious: metronidazole, nitrofurantoin, chloramphenicol; 
 Anti-leprosy drug: dapsone; 
 Anti-tuberculosis drug: isoniazid; 
 Anti-retroviral drugs: didanosine (DDI), zalcitabine (DDC); 
 Anti-arythmic drugs: amiodarone; 
 Anti-inflammatory drugs (disease-modifying therapy): gold salts; 
 Alcoholic detoxification: disulfiram; 
 Anti-epi[INVESTIGATOR_006]: phenitoin; 
 Others: alcohol, pyridoxin(Vit B6) at very high dose;

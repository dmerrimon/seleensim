CKGROUND AND RATIONALE 
 
1.1. Background 
 
Allogeneic blood or marrow transplantation (alloBMT) is a potentially curative therapy for a 
variety of hematologic malignancies, including the acute and chronic leukemias, myelodysplasia, 
lymphoma, and multiple myeloma1. 
 Clinical data now confirm that T cells contained within the 
donor graft are capable of exerting a “graft-versus-malignancy” effect2, 3. 
 However, successful 
application of alloBMT to patients with hematologic malignancies is limited by [CONTACT_808678], graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), opportunistic infection, and by 
[CONTACT_808679].  Substantial progress has been 
made recently in the development of reduced intensity conditioning regimens that facilitate the 
sustained engraftment of donor stem cells with less toxicity
4. 
 However, the problem of donor 
availability remains.  For the 70% or so of patients who lack an HLA-identical sibling, an 
acceptable alternative is the transplantation of stem cells from an HLA-identical unrelated donor.  
Still, only half of patients who might benefit from a transplant are able to find an HLA-identical 
sibling or unrelated donor.  This proportion is lower among patients belonging to racial or ethnic 
minorities, since unrelated donor registries contain relatively fewer individuals belonging to 
these minorities5. 
 Development of an alternative to HLA-identical sibling or unrelated donor 
transplantation could therefore expand the availability of this procedure to patients who need it, 
especially those belonging to minority groups. 
 
One potentially attractive alternative source of stem cells is a partially HLA-mismatched or 
HLA-haploidentical relative.  There are at least two advantages of HLA-haploidentical relatives 
as compared to unrelated donors.  First, since all biological parents and children and half of 
siblings share one HLA haplotype, there is a high likelihood of identifying an eligible donor.  
Second, donors can be identified promptly, whereas the time from initiation of search to 
unrelated donor identification takes a median of [ADDRESS_1117798] disease (GVHD)7, 8. 
 We have been 
investigating the effect of administering high dose, post-transplantation cyclophosphamide (Cy) 
on the incidence and severity of these complications, first in animal models9, 10 and
 then in 
humans11. 
 The immunobiologic rationale for administering Cy after transplantation is that 
recently activated, alloreactive T cells (the cells most responsible for GVHD) are selectively sensitive to the toxic effects of this drug
12.  
Pre-clinical studies demonstrated that engraftment of 
major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-mismatched bone marrow could be achieved by [CONTACT_808680]-transplantation fludarabine and low dose (200 
cGy) total body irradiation, and post-transplantation Cy
9. 
 Additional studies demonstrated that 
post-transplantation Cy reduced the incidence and severity of GVHD in the setting of MHC-
mismatched alloBMT after myeloablative conditioning (unpublished data). 
 
Based upon the encouraging results in the pre-clinical model, two independent clinical trials, one 
at the Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins (n=60) and the other at

Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (n=28), evaluated the safety and efficacy of high-
dose, post-transplantation cyclophosphamide (Cy) to prevent graft rejection and GVHD after 
outpatient nonmyeloablative conditioning and T cell-replete bone marrow transplantation from 
partially HLA-mismatched related donors.  Eighty-eight consecutive patients were accrued to 
these trials between 1999 and 2006.  Eligible patients were 0.5-70 yr of age with high-risk 
hematologic malignancies or paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH; n=1) for whom 
standard allogeneic (HLA-matched, related or unrelated) or autologous BMT was unavailable or 
inappropriate.  Eligible hematologic malignancies included interferon- or imatinib-refractory 
chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in first chronic phase or any CML in second chronic phase 
(n=9), poor-risk acute leukemia in first complete remission (CR) or any acute leukemia in CR> 2 
(n
=40), advanced myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS; n=6), poor-risk chronic lymphocytic 
leukemia (n=3), and lymphoma or multiple myeloma in resistant relapse (not responsive to conventional salvage therapy prior to transplantation) or in relapse after autologous 
transplantation (n=29).  Twenty-three patients (26%) had failed at least one autologous stem cell 
transplantation (SCT), including 12 of 13 patients with Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), 5 of 11 
patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), 3 of 34 patients with acute myeloid leukemia 
(AML), and one patient each with CML, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and multiple 
myeloma.  Two additional patients had received autologous BMT for a malignancy prior to a 
diagnosis of therapy-related MDS.  Twenty-five percent of patients were from ethnic minority 
groups. 
 
Patients on the two protocols were treated in three separate groups designated Hopkins A, 
Hopkins B and Seattle, which differed by [CONTACT_496741] (Figure 1.1).  The 
intent was to treat all patients as outpatients.  Transplantation conditioning consisted of Cy 14.5 
mg/kg/day IV on Days –6 and –5, fludarabine 30 mg/m
2/
day IV on Days –6 to –2, and 200 cGy 
of TBI on Day –1.  On Day 0, patients received donor marrow, which was obtained in a targeted 
collection of 4 x 108 n
ucleated cells/kg recipi[INVESTIGATOR_808644] a Gambro Spectra apheresis instrument.  On Day 3, 50 mg/kg Cy was 
administered over 90 min together with Mesna (80% dose of Cy in 4 divided doses over 8 hr) by 
[CONTACT_16228] (Hopkins A and Seattle groups).  The Hopkins B group received an additional dose 
of Cy on Day 4.  Pharmacologic prophylaxis of GVHD was initiated on the day following 
completion of post-transplantation Cy.  All patients received tacrolimus, which was initiated at a 
dose of 1 mg IV daily, adjusted to achieve a therapeutic level of 5-15 ng/ml, and then converted 
to oral form until discontinuation.  If there was no active GVHD, tacrolimus was tapered after 
Day 90 (Seattle) or discontinued on Day 50 or 180 (Hopkins A and B, respectively).  All patients 
received mycophenolate mofetil until Day 35 at a dose of 15 mg/kg PO twice daily (Hopkins 
group A) or thrice daily (Hopkins B and Seattle groups), with a maximum daily dose of 3 g in 
the Hopkins B group.  Patients received filgrastim, 5 g/kg/day by [CONTACT_808681] 1 (Hopkins) or Day 4 (Seattle) and continuing until recovery of neutrophils to >1000/L for three days.

Engraftment and chimerism.  Forty-four 44 of 88 donors were siblings, 22 were parents and 22 
were children of the patients.  By [CONTACT_83502][INVESTIGATOR_007], donors differed from their recipi[INVESTIGATOR_808645] a median of 3 of 8 (HLA-A, -B, -Cw, and DRB1) HLA alleles in both the host-versus-graft 
(HVG) and graft-versus-host (GVH) directions.  About one-third of donor-recipi[INVESTIGATOR_808646].  The three groups did not differ with respect to 
the age of the donors, the relationship of donors to the patients, or the total number of HLA allele 
mismatches in either the HVG or GVH directions. 
 
Median times to recovery of neutrophils and platelets were 15 and 24 days, respectively.  The 
median times to neutrophil recovery (Fig. 1.2A) were 15, 12, and 16 days and the median times 
to platelet recovery (Fig. 1.2B) were 30, 18, and 26 days for the Hopkins A, Seattle, and Hopkins 
B groups, respectively.  Compared to patients in the Hopkins A group, patients in the Seattle 
group had significantly faster recoveries of neutrophils (HR 2.74, 95% CI 1.38-5.44, p=.004) and 
platelets (HR 2.59, 95% CI 1.26-5.34, p=.01).  Factors in multivariate analysis that were 
associated with significantly delayed recoveries of neutrophils and platelets were lower graft 
CD34
+ cel
l content and administration of a second dose of post-transplantation Cy.  Increasing 
mismatch in the HVG direction was associated with delayed platelet but not neutrophil recovery.

Adjusting for group, transplantation of female donor marrow into a male recipi[INVESTIGATOR_808647] (OR=6.08, 95% CI 1.6-22.8, p=0.01) while increasing numbers of 
prior regimens decreased the risk of failure (OR=0.61, 95% CI 0.38-0.96, p=0.03). 
 
Measurable disease was present in 11 of 15 patients with graft failure; of these, five achieved 
objective clinical responses, including 3 of 5 patients with MDS (1 CR x 1193 days, 2 PR) and [ADDRESS_1117800]. 
 
Engrafting patients achieved full donor chimerism rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375] (Fig. 1.3).  Analysis of peripheral 
blood that was either (i) unfractionated (Hopkins groups) or (ii) separated into T-cell (CD3-
positive) or granulocyte (CD33-positive) fractions (Seattle group) showed that with few 
exceptions, donor chimerism in patients with sustained engraftment was virtually complete 
(>95%)  by [ADDRESS_1117801] between 60 and 90 days after transplantation, unless complications requiring admission to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_808648].  The median number of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_808649] 60 was 1 (range 0-4) for each patient group, and 
the median length of stay was 4 days (range 0-44).  Neutropenic fever accounted for 56% of the 
admissions; non-neutropenic fever accounted for 33%; other causes, including acute GVHD, 
accounted for the remaining 11%.  Thirty-six patients (41%) did not require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_808650] 60 days of transplantation. 
 
Patients who are seropositive for cytomegalovirus (CMV) are known to be at high-risk for 
reactivating CMV after transplantation, regardless of the serologic status of the donor
13. 
 In this 
study, CMV reactivation was observed in 20 of 60 (33%) high-risk patients.  The incidence of 
reactivation but not the median time to onset differed across the groups.  Acute GVHD was 
diagnosed in 10 of 20 (50%) patients on or about the time of CMV reactivation.  CMV

neumonia developed in only one patient and there was no CMV-associated mortality.  Proven 
or probable invasive mold infections, all caused by [CONTACT_207106] , were observed in 6 of 88 
(6.8%) patients of whom two had infection prior to transplant.  Two patients died from 
Aspergillus  infection, one while persistently neutropenic following graft failure. 
 
Graft-versus-host disease.  The cumulative incidences of grades II-IV and III-IV acute GVHD 
by [CONTACT_2006] 200 were 35% and 10%, respectively (Fig. 1.4A).  The groups did not differ significantly 
in the incidence of grades II-IV or III-IV acute GVHD.  The combined incidence of graft failure 
and severe acute GVHD in the Hopkins A group was 55% by [ADDRESS_1117802] year after 
transplantation were 22% and 14%, respectively (Fig. 1.4B).  At one year after transplantation, 
the cumulative incidences of chronic GVHD were 15%, 46%, and 8% in the Hopkins A, Seattle, 
and Hopkins B groups, respectively; corresponding incidences of extensive chronic GVHD were 
15%, 25%, and 5%.  The incidence of chronic GVHD in the Seattle group was significantly 
higher than in both the Hopkins B (HR 7.95; 95% CI 2.29-27.6; p = .001) and Hopkins A groups 
(HR 3.86; 95% CI 1.14-13.08; p=.03).  The incidence of extensive chronic GVHD was 
significantly higher in the Seattle group than in the Hopkins B group (HR 5.66; 95% CI 1.21-
26.43, p = .03) but not significantly higher than in the Hopkins A group (HR 1.77; 95% CI 0.47-
6.74; p = .4). 
 
Non-relapse mortality (NRM), relapse, and overall and event-free survival (EFS).  The 
cumulative incidences of NRM at 180 days and 1 year after transplantation were 13% and 19%, 
respectively.  The cumulative incidences of relapse at 1 and 2 years after transplantation were 
50% and 57%, respectively (Figure 1.5A and data not shown).  There were no significant 
differences in the cumulative incidences of either NRM or relapse among groups.  In a stratified 
multivariate analysis, patients with lymphoid malignancies had a significantly lower risk of 
relapse than patients with myeloid malignancies (HR 0.46, 95% CI .25-.88, p =.02).  In the same 
analysis, increasing age, graft CD3
+ cel
l dose, and number of prior regimens were not associated 
with a significantly increased incidence of relapse.

 Non-relapse Mortality, Relapse, Overall and Event-free Survival 
 
At a median follow-up of survivors of 817 days (range, 112-1808 days), the actuarial overall 
survivals of the entire group at 1 and 2 years were 45% and 35%, respectively (Figure 1.5B).  
The actuarial EFS at 1 and 2 years were 32% and 24%, respectively (Figure 1.5C).  Survival and 
EFS did not differ significantly among groups.  However, compared to patients with myeloid 
malignancies, patients with lymphoid malignancies showed a trend toward a higher EFS at 1 
year (42% versus 24%) and at 2 years after transplantation (36% versus 15%; p < .07; Figure 
1.5D).  Fifty-eight patients have died; among these patients, post-transplantation relapse or 
progression of the underlying disease was diagnosed in 41.  GVHD accounted for five of the 16 
deaths in the Hopkins A group but for only two out of 42 deaths in the other two treatment 
groups.  Only four patients died of infection without GVHD. 
 
Multivariate analysis of risk factors for EFS was performed.  Compared to patients with AML, 
patients with NHL and HL had higher EFS.  Interestingly, an increasing number of HLA-antigen 
mismatches in the HVG direction was associated with improved EFS, whereas an increasing 
graft dose of CD3+ cel
ls was associated with worse EFS.  Also, a donor-recipi[INVESTIGATOR_808651] a lower risk of relapse and improved overall and event-free survival compared to lesser degrees of HLA mismatch in the 
same direction (data not shown).   
 
In summary, HLA-haploidentical BMT after non-myeloablative conditioning and using [ADDRESS_1117803]-transplantation Cy followed by [CONTACT_808682] a well-tolerated procedure that can be 
administered largely in an outpatient setting.  The toxicity of the procedure compares favorably 
to the toxicity of non-myeloablative transplantation using unrelated or even HLA-identical 
sibling donors.  The major cause of treatment failure in this high-risk population is relapse, 
occurring in approximately 60% of patients.  Sustained disease responses were seen primarily in 
patients with AML and lymphoma.

cyclophosphamide.  The purpose is to determine whether results in a single center setting can be 
duplicated in a multi-center setting.  If the results of this therapy are acceptable, a randomized 
trial comparing it to unrelated donor transplantation would be planned.    
2.1.1.  Hypotheses and Specific Objectives 
 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Hypotheses 
 
Primary Hypothesis
: 
180 day survival after non-myeloablative haploidentical bone marrow 
transplantation is higher than 60%, similar to what is observed after non-myeloablative unrelated 
donor bone marrow/peripheral blood transplantation. 
 
Secondary Hypotheses :  
1. Mo
re than 80% of engrafting patients will achieve  95% donor chimerism by [CONTACT_2006] 56 
after BMT. 
2. The incidence of Grades III-IV GVHD will be less than 30%. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Study objectives 
 
The primary objective is to determine overall survival [ADDRESS_1117807]-transplant 
cyclophosphamide.  Secondary objectives include estimating overall and progression-free 
survival one year after transplantation, treatment-related mortality, incidence of neutrophil and 
platelet recovery, incidence of graft failure, cumulative incidence of acute and chronic GVHD, 
incidence of infections, and cumulative incidence of relapse/progression.  The proportion of 
patients able to find acceptable donors and the proportion proceeding to transplant will also be 
described.

Fludarabine 30 mg/m2/d
ay will be administered over 30-60 minutes intravenous infusion on 
Days –6 through –2.  Fludarabine will be dosed according to the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]’s actual body weight, 
unless the actual body weight is greater than or equal to two times their ideal body weight, in 
which case the Protocol Team must be consulted for instruction.

 Cy 14.5 mg/kg/day will be administered as a 1-2 hour intravenous infusion with a high volume 
fluid flush on Days –6 and –5.  Cy will be dosed according to the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]’s ideal body weight 
(IBW), unless the patient weighs more than 125% of IBW, in which case the drug will be dosed 
according to the adjusted IBW (AIBW; see below for formulas).  Uroprotection can be 
administered according to institutional guidelines.  Mesna is recommended to accompany pre-
transplantation Cy, but is not required.   Ideal Body Weight (IBW) Formulas: 
 
Males IBW = 50 kg + 2.3 kg/inch over 5 feet 
 
Females IBW = 45.5 kg + 2.3 kg/inch over 5 feet

 AIBW = IBW + [(0.25) x (ABW - IBW)] 
 
 
2.5.4.  Total Body Irradiation 
 
Total body irradiation: 200 cGy will be administered in a single fraction on Day –1.  Radiation 
sources and dose rates will also be defined by [CONTACT_8236].  TBI may be delivered from either 
linear accelerator or Cobalt sources.  Bone marrow may be infused on the same day as TBI

stration as long as there is 4-6 hours between administration of TBI and infusion of bone 
marrow. 
 
2.5.5.  Bone Marrow Transplantation 
 
On Day 0, patients will receive unprocessed marrow unless there is a major ABO 
incompatibility, in which case red blood cells will be depleted from the donor marrow using 
institutional practices.  Institutional practices will determine if there will be processing for minor 
ABO incompatibilities. Donor bone marrow will be harvested with a target yield of 4 x 108 
n
ucleated cells/kg recipi[INVESTIGATOR_43223].  Sample of the product to be infused will be sent for flow 
cytometry to determine the content of CD34+ CD3+,
 CD4+,
 and CD8+ cel
ls. 
 
2.5.6.  Post-transplantation Cyclophosphamide with Mesna 
 
Hydration prior to cyclophosphamide may be given according to institutional standards.  A 
recommended approach is as follows: Patients are instructed to increase fluids overnight before 
cyclophosphamide administration.  Hydration with normal saline at 3 ml/kg/hr IV will be started 
2 hours prior to cyclophosphamide, then the rate will be reduced to 2 ml/kg/hr for 1 hour pre-
cyclophosphamide and continued at 2 ml/kg/hr for [ADDRESS_1117816]-
cyclophosphamide or administered per institutional standards.  Mesna dose will be based on the 
cyclophosphamide dose being given.  The total daily dose of mesna is equal to 80% of the total 
daily dose of cyclophosphamide.   
 
Cyclophosphamide [50mg/kg IBW] will be given on Day [ADDRESS_1117817]-transplant (between 60 and 72 
hours after marrow infusion) and on Day [ADDRESS_1117818]-transplant (approximately 24 hours after Day 3 
cyclophosphamide).  Cyclophosphamide will be given as an IV infusion over 1-2 hours 
(depending on volume). 
 
It is crucial that no immunosuppressive agents are given until [ADDRESS_1117819]-transplant Cy.  This includes corticosteroids as anti-emetics. 
 
2.5.7.  Tacrolimus 
 
Tacrolimus will be given at a dose of 1 mg IV qd or 1 mg po bid, then will be changed to a PO 
dosing schedule once a therapeutic level is achieved or as per institutional standards.  Serum 
levels of tacrolimus will be measured around Day 7 and then should be checked weekly 
thereafter and the dose adjusted accordingly to maintain a level of 5-10 ng/mL.  Tacrolimus will 
be discontinued after the last dose around Day 180, or may be continued if active GVHD is 
present.  Cyclosporine (target concentration 200-400 ng/ml) may be substituted for tacrolimus if 
the patient is intolerant of tacrolimus.

.8. Mycophenolate Mofetil (MMF) 
 
MMF will be given at a dose of 15 mg/kg PO TID (based upon actual body weight) with the 
maximum total daily dose not to exceed 3 grams (1 g PO TID).  MMF prophylaxis will be 
discontinued after the last dose on Day 35, or may be continued if active GVHD is present.  
 
2.5.9.  Supportive Care 
 
Patients will receive transfusions, infection prophylaxis and nutritional support according to 
institutional guidelines.  Infection prophylaxis should include, but is not limited to, agents or 
strategies (e.g., PCR screening and preemptive therapy) to prevent herpes simplex, 
cytomegalovirus (CMV), Pneumocystis carinii, and fungal infections.   
 
2.5.10.  Transfusion Support 
 
Platelet and packed red cell transfusions will be given per current institutional recommendations. 
 
2.5.11.  Anti-Ovulatory Treatment 
 
Menstruating females should be started on an anti-ovulatory agent prior to the initiation of the 
preparative regimen. 
 
2.5.12.  Post-BMT Evaluation 
 
Patients will be followed at the institution that performed the BMT at least until the 
chimerism/disease evaluation performed on Day ~[ADDRESS_1117820] be interpreted by [CONTACT_808684].    
 
2.6. Risks and Toxicities 
 
Cyclophosphamide:    
Cyclophosphamide side effects include: nausea/vomiting, cardiomyopathy, skin rash, mucositis, stomatitis, sterility, diarrhea, hemorrhagic cystitis, fluid weight gain/edema, 
alopecia and hemolytic/anemia. 
 
Fludarabine: 
a. Neurotoxicity: Agitation or confusion, blurred vision, loss of hearing, peripheral 
neuropathy or weakness have been reported.  Severe neurologic effects, including 
blindness, coma, and death are seen in 36% of patients treated with doses approximately 
four times greater than recommended; severe CNS toxicity is rarely seen with doses in 
the recommended range for nontransplant therapy of hematologic malignancies.  Effect 
of chronic use on the CNS is unknown, although patients have received recommended 
doses for up to [ADDRESS_1117821] Haplo – Protocol # [ADDRESS_1117822] been used in adult and pediatric patients and increased 
neurotoxicity has not been observed.  
 
b. Anemia: Life-threatening and sometimes fatal autoimmune hemolytic anemia has been 
reported after one or more cycles of therapy in patients with or without a previous history 
of autoimmune hemolytic anemia or a positive Coombs’ test and who may or may not be 
in remission; no mechanisms for development of this complication have been identified.  
Corticosteroids may or may not be effective in controlling these epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841].  The majority 
of patients re-challenged developed a recurrence of the hemolytic process.  
 
c. Cardiovascular: Deep venous thrombosis, phlebitis, transient ischemic attack, and aneurysm (1%) are reported.    
 
d. Fever: 60% of patients develop fever. 
 
e. Skin Rash: 15% of patients develop a skin rash, which may be pruritic.  
 
f. Digestive: Gastrointestinal side effects include: nausea/vomiting (36%), diarrhea (15%), 
stomatitis (9%), anorexia (7%), GI bleeding and esophagitis (3%), mucositis (2%), liver 
failure, abnormal liver function test, constipation, dysphagia (1%) and mouth sores.  
 
g. Some other effects are: Chills (11%), peripheral edema (8%), myalgia (4%), osteoporosis 
(2%), pancytopenia, arthralgia (1%), dysuria (4%), urinary tract infection and hematuria 
(2%); renal failure, abnormal renal function test, and proteinuria (1%); and, very rarely, 
hemorrhagic cystitis and pulmonary toxicity.  
 
Total Body Irradiation: 
TBI can cause: nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, parotitis (rapid onset within 24-48 hours, 
usually self-limited), generalized mild erythema, hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_371], fever, mucositis, 
and alopecia. 
 
Late effects include: possible growth retardation, vertebral deformities, cataracts, 
probable increased risk of secondary malignant neoplasms, sterility, nephropathy, 
interstitial pneumonitis and veno-occlusive disease.   
 
Mycophenolate Mofetil: 
Side effects include: pancytopenia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, hypertension, headache, 
dizziness, insomnia, hyperglycemia, electrolyte imbalances, rash, and leg cramps/bone 
pain. 
 
Tacrolimus:  
Side effects include: reversible renal insufficiency, hypertension, hyperglycemia, 
hypomagnesemia, hypokalemia, and neurologic toxicity.

ENDPOINTS 
 
3.1. Primary Endpoint 
 
The primary endpoint is overall survival at 180 days from the time of transplantation.   
 
3.2. Secondary Endpoints 
 3.2.1.  Neutrophil Recovery  
 
Neutrophil recovery is defined as achieving an ANC ≥ 500/mm
[ADDRESS_1117823] of the three days will be designated the day of 
neutrophil recovery.  The only competing event for neutrophil recovery is death without 
neutrophil recovery.   
 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Primary graft failure 
 
Primary graft failure is defined as < 5% donor chimerism on all measurements.   
 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Secondary graft failure 
 
Secondary graft failure is defined as initial recovery followed by [CONTACT_808686] < 5% donor 
chimerism. If no chimerism assays were performed and ANC is < 500/mm3,
 then it will be 
counted as a secondary graft failure.   
[IP_ADDRESS].  Platelet recovery  
 
Platelet recovery is defined by [CONTACT_808687] a sustained platelet count 
>20,000/mm
3 o
r >50,000/mm3 w
ith no platelet transfusions in the preceding seven days.  The 
first day of the sustained platelet count will be designated the day of platelet engraftment. 
 
3.2.2.  Donor Cell Engraftment  
 
Donor cell engraftment is defined as donor chimerism  5% on Day  56 after transplantation.  
Chimerism should be evaluated on Days ~28, ~56, ~180, and ~[ADDRESS_1117824] Disease 
 
The cumulative incidences of grade II – IV and III – IV acute GVHD will be determined.  Acute 
GVHD will be graded according to the BMT CTN MOP.  The time to onset of acute grades II-IV 
GVHD and grades III-IV GVHD will be recorded, as well as the maximum grade achieved.   
 
BM
T CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK  NST Haplo – Protocol # [ADDRESS_1117825] Disease 
 
Chronic GVHD will be scored according to the BMT CTN MOP.  The time to onset of limited 
and extensive chronic GVHD will be recorded.   
 
3.2.5.  Progression-free Survival 
 
Progression-free survival is defined as the minimum time interval of the times to 
relapse/recurrence, to death or to last follow-up. 
 
3.2.6.  Treatment-Related Mortality (TRM) 
 
The cumulative incidence of TRM will be estimated at Day 100, 180, and at [ADDRESS_1117826]-
transplant. 
 
3.2.8.  Relapse and Residual Disease 
 
Relapse of Malignancy  – Testing for recurrent malignancy in the blood, marrow or other sites 
will be used to assess relapse after transplantation.  For the purpose of this study, relapse is 
defined by [CONTACT_207124]-
transplant features, or radiologic evidence (including the recurrence of fluoro-deoxyglucose 
[FDG]-avid lesions on PET scan) of progressive lymphoma.  When in doubt, the diagnosis of 
recurrent or progressive lymphoma should be documented by [CONTACT_102135].   
 
Minimal Residual Disease – Minimal residual disease is defined by [CONTACT_207125], or fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), or Southern blot, 
or Western blot, or polymerase chain reaction (PCR), or other techniques, in absence of 
morphological or cytogenetic evidence of disease in blood or marrow.  Since the frequency of 
testing for minimal residual disease is highly variable among centers, and the sensitivity is highly 
variable among laboratory techniques, evidence of minimal residual disease will not be sufficient 
to meet the definition of relapse in the context of this study.  Data on tapering 
immunosuppression, administering chemotherapy or biological agents to in response to detection 
of minimal residual disease will be captured in the case report forms.

(parent, sibling, or child) as a donor.  The sample size is 50 patients.  Patients with acute 
lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma, acute myelogenous leukemia, marginal zone B-cell 
lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, and chemotherapy-sensitive Burkitt, large-cell, and Hodgkin 
lymphoma are eligible. A primary purpose of this study is to determine if results from a single 
center study can be duplicated in a multi-center setting.  
 
5.2. Accrual 
 
It is estimated that three years of accrual will be necessary to enroll the targeted sample size.  
Accrual will be reported by [CONTACT_545], ethnicity, gender, and age.  
 5.3. Study Duration 
 Patients will be followed by [CONTACT_808688] a minimum of one year post-transplant. 
Additional follow-up will be available through routine CIBMTR mechanisms (see Section 4.2.1). 
 
5.4. Randomization 
 
There is no randomization in this trial. 
 5.5. Primary Objective 
 The primary endpoint is the proportion of patients who survive for 180 days after transplantation.  
The choice of this endpoint is based on CIBMTR registry data reported by [CONTACT_808689] (Biol 
Blood Marrow Transpl 2007; 13:1083) for unrelated adult donor transplants. In this study the 
probability of 6-month survival was 60 %.  The primary analysis will include all transplanted 
patients.  Death from any cause is the event for this endpoint.  The study is designed to rule out 
survival percentages below 40%.  
 5.6. Sample Size and Power Considerations 
 The sample size is 50 patients.  Table 5.6.1 provides 90% confidence intervals for a variety of 
observed proportions.  For example if 30 of the 50 patients survive (60% observed survival 
percentage) the length of the confidence interval is 22.8%.  The percentages above and below 
60% are intended to represent other plausible survival rates.

his is an exploratory study with a decision rule that a further Phase III study would be 
warranted if the lower bound of a 90% confidence interval for the survival estimate is above 
40%.  The probability to rule out survival percentages of a certain size is known as “power”.  
Table 5.6.2 provides the probability (or power) that the lower bound of a 90% two-sided 
confidence interval for the overall survival probability will be greater than a threshold of 70%, 
65%, 60%, 55%, 50% or 45%.  Based on the table below, there is 84% power at = .05to reject 
the null if the true percentage is < 40%.

six-month intervals.  Monitoring of key safety endpoints will be conducted monthly, and if rates 
significantly exceed pre-set thresholds, the NHLBI will be notified in order that the DSMB can 
be advised.  Policies and composition of the DSMB are described in the BMT CTN's Manual of 
Procedures.  The stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_808660]. 
 
Two safety endpoints for this study are treatment-related mortality (TRM) and graft failure.  The 
rate of TRM will be monitored up to [ADDRESS_1117848] be observed 
in order to trigger review.  Each month, the null hypothesis that the 100-day TRM rate is less 
than or equal to 30% is tested.  Similarly, the null hypothesis that the 56-day graft failure rate is 
less than or equal to 12% is tested.  Primary graft failure, secondary graft failure and second 
transplants will be counted as events for this stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_70663].  An extension of the sequential probability ratio test (SPRT) for censored exponential data will be used for each endpoint, as 
described in greater detail below and in Appendix E. 
 
This sequential testing procedure conserves type I error across all of the monthly examinations 
for a single endpoint, but not across the multiple safety endpoints.  Thus for a single endpoint, 
the type I error is approximately 5%, and across two safety endpoints, the study-wide type I error 
is < 10%.  The rationale for not conserving type I error across multiple safety endpoints is 
BM
T CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK  NST Haplo – Protocol # [ADDRESS_1117849], and is not a 
formal “stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1877]” that would mandate automatic closure of study enrollment.   
 
The SPRT can be represented graphically.  At each monthly interim analysis, the total time on 
study is plotted against the total number of endpoints (e.g., patients experiencing TRM).  The 
continuation region of the SPRT is defined by [CONTACT_110893].  Only the lower boundary will 
be used for monitoring to protect against excessive 100-day TRM.  If the graph falls below the 
lower boundary, the SPRT rejects the null hypothesis, and concludes that there are more events 
than predicted by [CONTACT_258075].  Otherwise, the SPRT continues until enrollment 
reaches the maximum of [ADDRESS_1117850], 
summed for all patients on study.

he tests to be used in this protocol were developed from the following SPRTs:   
 A SPRT contrasting 30% versus 50% 100-day rate of TRM results in decision boundaries 
with a common slope of 0.54 and the intercepts are –1.74 and 1.46 with nominal type I 
and II errors of 10% and 15%, respectively 
 A SPRT contrasting 12% versus 30% 56-day rate of graft failure results in decision boundaries with a common slope of 0.69 and the intercepts are –1.43 and 1.20, with 
nominal type I and II errors of 10% and 15%, respectively. 
 
The actual operating characteristics of the truncated test, shown in Table 5.7.1, were determined

confidence interval will be calculated.  All registered patients will be considered for this analysis.  
 
5.10. Analysis of Secondary Endpoints 
1. Overall survival : The overall survival distribution at one and two years after 
transplantation will be estimated by [CONTACT_8761]-Meier curve.  All patients will be 
followed for a minimum of two years post-transplant for mortality. 
2. Neutrophil recovery : To assess the incidence of neutrophil recovery from day of 
transplant, a cumulative incidence curve will be computed along with a 95% confidence interval. Death prior to neutrophil recovery will be considered a competing risk. 
3. Platelet recovery:  To assess the incidence of platelet recovery from day of transplant, a 
cumulative incidence curve will be computed along with a 95% confidence interval. 
Death prior to platelet recovery will be considered a competing risk. 
4. Chimerism : The degree of donor chimerism will be assessed on Days 28, 56, 180, and 
365 after transplantation. 
5. Graft failure : To assess the incidence of primary and secondary graft failure a 
cumulative incidence curve will be computed along with a 95% confidence interval. Death prior to graft failure will be considered as a competing risk.   
6. Acute GVHD:   To assess the incidence of grades II-IV and grade III-IV acute GVHD 
from day of transplant.  The first day of acute GVHD onset at a certain grade will be used 
to calculate a cumulative incidence curve for that acute GVHD grade.  An overall 
cumulative incidence curve will be computed along with a 95% confidence interval at 
[ADDRESS_1117855]-transplant with graft failure, disease progression, and death considered a 
competing risk. 
7. Chronic GVHD:  To assess the incidence and severity of extensive chronic GVHD from 
day of transplant, a cumulative incidence curve will be computed along with a 95% confidence interval at one and two years post-transplant.  The first day of clinical onset of 
extensive chronic GVHD will be used. Death, disease progression, or graft failure prior to 
occurrence of chronic GVHD will be considered competing risks. 
8. Treatment-related mortality : Treatment-related mortality at 100 days, six months, and 
one year will be estimated.  Disease progression is considered a competing risk. 
9. Relapse/progression : To assess the incidence of relapse/progression from day of 
transplant, a cumulative incidence curve will be computed along with a 95% confidence interval.  Death prior to relapse or progression will be considered a competing risk. 
10. Progression-free survival : To assess current progression-free survival, the one and two 
year progression-free survival probability after transplantation and 95% confidence 
interval will be calculated based on the Kaplan-Meier product limit estimator.

Introduction 
 
You are being invited to participate in a clinical trial.  A clinical trial is a research study to 
answer specific medical questions.  The information from this study may help future patients.  
This form tells you about the study.  In addition, the study doctor (the person in charge of the 
research) will explain the study to you.   
 
You are being asked to take part in this study because you have been found to have a cancer of 
the blood or lymph glands that may be treatable with stem cell transplantation from a relative or 
an unrelated donor.  We and other transplant centers have the most experience using a donor who 
is a “perfect” or close to perfect “tissue match”.  However, tissue typi[INVESTIGATOR_808661] a completely 
matched donor is unavailable within your family, although you do have a family member who is 
a partial match.  While an unrelated donor transplant is an option, we either have not been able to 
find a good match or we are concerned that your disease may worsen in the time it takes to find 
one.  
The investigators of this study want you to understand that patients in clinical trials include only 
those who are completely informed and choose to participate.  Please take your time to make 
your decision.  We encourage you to discuss your decision with your doctor, family, and friends.  
 
It is important that you know: 
 You will not be paid to be in this study. 
 You or your insurance company will pay the bills for your medical treatment except that,  
 You will not be charged for research tests. 
 You will face the same risks and benefits as any other bone marrow transplant patient.

Who is conducting this study? 
The research in this study is paid for by [CONTACT_7681] (NIH), which supports the 
Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network (BMT CTN).  The BMT CTN will direct the 
research study.  All decisions about how the study is done are made independently by [CONTACT_808690].   
 
 
Why is this study being done?   
This study is being done because at the present time there are no curative therapi[INVESTIGATOR_808662].  Because of your age or underlying health and 
the fact that you do not have a matched donor, you have a higher likelihood of experiencing harm 
from a conventional stem cell transplant.  We are hopi[INVESTIGATOR_808663] (sometimes referred to as a “nonmyeloablative”) from partially mismatched 
donors is safe enough to allow further analysis in more detailed clinical trials.   
 
There is no guarantee or promise that this procedure will be successful.   
 
 
How many people will take part in the study?  
A total of 50 patients will participate in this study.  This study will be done many different 
medical centers in the [LOCATION_002], including [Center Name/Location]. 
 
 What will happen if I take part in this research study?   
In this study, we will use a partially mismatched donor from your family for a new type of bone 
marrow transplant called “nonmyeloablative transplant” which does not require using high doses of 
chemotherapy or radiotherapy.  You will be treated first with a type of chemotherapy called 
fludarabine (also called Fludara®), which is given intravenously through your catheter daily for five 
days.  You also will be given cyclophosphamide (also called Cytoxan ) intravenously, which is 
commonly used to treat cancer, on your first and second day along with fludarabine.  After the 
chemotherapy is completed, you will receive a small dose of radiation to your whole body in a 
single exposure.  The next day, Day 0, your donor’s marrow will be harvested and given to you 
through your catheter.  High doses of cyclophosphamide will be administered intravenously on the 
[ADDRESS_1117860] disease (GVHD), an attack by [CONTACT_808691].  Beginning on the 5th 
d
ay after transplantation, we will give you two other approved drugs, called tacrolimus (also called 
FK-506 or Prograf®), 
and Mycophenolate mofetil (also called MMF or CellCept®),af
ter the 
transplant to help prevent GVHD.  In certain cases where patients do not tolerate tacrolimus, they

ay be given cyclosporine, another approved drug that helps prevent GVHD.  GVHD is explained 
in greater detail on page B-9. 
 
You will continue to take MMF for about 5 weeks and tacrolimus for about 6 months.  Also 
beginning on the 5th d
ay after transplantation, you will also be given a growth factor called G-CSF 
(also called filgrastim or Neupogen ) by [CONTACT_808692].  The daily injections of G-CSF will 
be stopped when the white blood cells have recovered.  To make sure your donor’s bone marrow is 
growing back, blood or marrow samples will be obtained from you at about 1, 2, 6, and 12 months 
after transplant.  
 
The chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and even the supportive care you will receive are associated with many potential side effects, some of which may be life threatening.  These side effects are listed 
below in the section of risks of the study.  There can be additional risks associated with the use of 
antibiotics, which your doctor can discuss with you.  
 
You will receive treatment for any infections according to medical standards.   
 
Blood tests will be performed frequently to evaluate your response to treatment and possible side 
effects of treatment.  If necessary, platelet and red cell transfusions will be given to maintain 
adequate levels and antibiotics will be given to treat or prevent infection.  You may also require 
intravenous nutritional support and pain medications during or after transplantation.  You will be 
monitored closely for any signs and symptoms of GVHD. 
 
 
How long will I be in this study? 
Your treatment will last approximately 2-[ADDRESS_1117861] of your life.  We 
will do this by [CONTACT_808693] a year.  Keepi[INVESTIGATOR_808664]-term side effects of treatment.  Many transplant 
centers include this type of long-term follow-up as part of their regular care.  
 
 
Can I stop being in this study?   
Yes.  You can decide to stop at any time.  Tell your doctor if you are thinking about stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_59917].  He or she will tell you how to stop safely.  If you decide to withdraw from the 
study, we ask that you tell your doctor.  If you withdraw, there will be no penalty or loss of 
benefit to which you are entitled and you will continue to receive medical care.  If you do not 
want this, you must specifically tell your doctor.

  Risk
s and Toxicities Related to Standard Transplant Procedures 
 
Risks of Bone Marrow Transplantation 
The following problems may occur as a result of transplantation of bone marrow.  These are risks 
that would be present whether such a transplant was done as part of the study or not:  
1. Slow Recovery of Blood Counts. The red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets can 
be slow to recover after bone marrow transplantation.  Until your blood counts recover, you will need blood and platelet transfusions, and will be at risk for bleeding and infections.  
Although infections can be treated with drugs, they can be very dangerous or fatal.  To 
speed the recovery of the white cells as much as possible you will receive growth factor, a 
hormone that tells the bone marrow to make white blood cells.    
2. Graft Failure. The bone marrow stem cells (the “graft”) may fail to grow inside your body.  
Past experience suggests that there can be up to a 15% chance of graft failure.  If graft 
failure occurs, this may result in low blood counts for a long period of time.  Graft failure 
can be fatal.  
BM
T CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK  NST Haplo – Protocol # [ADDRESS_1117865] Disease (GVHD).   This condition results from the bone marrow cells 
recognizing your body as foreign and attacking it.  In most cases, GVHD can be 
successfully treated.  Sometimes GVHD is severe or difficult to treat and may lead to death.  
You will be watched closely for this complication and given medication to prevent and/or 
treat it.   
There are two forms of GVHD: acute GVHD (occurs in the first 3 months after transplant) 
and chronic GVHD (after the first 3 months).  Acute GVHD may produce skin rash, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, abnormalities of liver function, and an increased risk of 
infection.  Chronic GVHD may produce skin rashes, hair loss, thickened dry skin, dry eyes, 
dry mouth, liver disease, weight loss, diarrhea, and an increased risk of infection.  To 
confirm the diagnosis of acute or chronic GVHD, you may be asked to have a biopsy (i.e. 
taking a small sample of tissue to look at under the microscope) of your skin, gut, or, rarely, 
your liver.   
4. Other Complications.  Other complications that can result from the transplantation 
procedure not specifically related to one specific drug or the bone marrow stem cells or this study include:  
a. Damage to the vital organs in your body.  This could result in problems in any 
body organ, such as heart, lungs, liver, gut, kidneys and bladder, brain, etc.  The 
lungs and the liver are particularly vulnerable.  Some patients will experience severe 
lung problems due to infections and/or due to a reaction of the lungs to the 
chemotherapy and radiation. Rarely patients can suffer veno-occlusive disease of the 
liver (VOD).  This complication results from high doses of chemotherapy and/or 
radiation.  Patients with VOD become jaundiced (yellowish skin), have liver 
function abnormalities, abdominal swelling, and abdominal pain.  Although many 
patients recover completely, these complications may cause permanent damage or 
even death.  
b. Serious infections.  Full and complete recovery of your immune system may take 
many months following the initial recovery of your cell counts.   During this time, 
there is an increased risk of infections.  You will be prescribed certain medications 
to reduce the chance of those infections.  However,  preventative treatments are not 
always effective.  If you have an infection, you may have to stay in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_808665]-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_504008].  Although most infections can be 
successfully treated, some infections may result in death.   
c. Recurrence of disease, or development of a new blood cancer. Your leukemia or 
lymphoma may come back even if the transplant is initially successful.  In rare cases 
a blood cancer may arise from cells of the donor.  Cyclophosphamide can cause 
damage to blood cells, which may result in a blood cancer such as 
myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML).  The blood 
cancer usually develops 2-10 years after treatment, or 6 years on average.  The 
risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a new blood cancer after allogeneic BMT is probably less than 
2%.  However, since your donor’s marrow is exposed to cyclophosphamide after 
the transplant, there is a risk that a blood cancer may develop in your donor’s 
blood cells.  This risk is unknown, but it may be as high as 5-10%.  If cancer 
develops in your donor’s blood cells, you may require additional treatment with

T CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK  NST Haplo – Protocol # [ADDRESS_1117866] 
use some form of effective birth control while receiving chemotherapy, TBI, and 
GVHD prophylaxis.  Effective birth control is defined as the following:  
1) Refraining from all acts of vaginal intercourse (ABSTINENCE)  
2) Consistent use of birth  control pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353] 
3) Injectable birth control methods (Depro-Provera, Norplant) 
4) Tubal sterilization or male partner who has undergone a vasectomy 
5) Placement of an IUD (intrauterine device) 
6) Use, with every act of intercourse, of a diaphragm with contraceptive jelly 
and/or condoms with contraceptive foam. 
e. Sterility and future childbearing potential for men and women.  Chemotherapy 
and/or irradiation may affect your ability to have children.  Male patients may 
become sterile (unable to produce sperm) and should discuss with their doctor 
regarding sperm banking prior to transplantation.  Female patients who have attained 
puberty may find that their menstrual cycle becomes irregular or stops permanently.  
However, this DOES NOT MEAN THAT YOU CANNOT BECOME 
PREGNANT, and you must use some effective method of birth control during 
transplant and afterwards until you are off GVHD prophylaxis.  Damage to 
reproductive tissue may result in infertility (inability to have children).  It is not 
known if the damage could result in birth defects.  You should discuss these risks 
and options in detail with your doctor before entering this study.  
5. Unknown or Unexpected Side Effects.   As with any treatment, there may be unknown 
and/or unexpected side effects from a nonmyeloablative bone marrow transplant.  We many 
learn new things about nonmyeloablative bone marrow transplants that might make you 
want to stop being in the study.  We will let you know if this happens and you can decide if 
you want to continue in the study.   
6. Additional information regarding MMF  
a. MMF could be damaging to an unborn baby [CONTACT_808694].   
b. MMF can limit the effectiveness of birth control pi[INVESTIGATOR_808666].

BM
T CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK  NST Haplo – Protocol # [ADDRESS_1117869] leukemia or lymphoma.  Leukemia and lymphoma are cancers of the blood cells made 
in your body’s “blood factory”, which is called the bone marrow.  These diseases are treated with 
special medicines.  These medicines are called chemotherapy.  They kill cancer cells.  If 
chemotherapy doesn’t kill all of the cancer cells, a special and stronger treatment called a 
transplant may be needed.   
 
During some transplants, you receive a very large amount of chemotherapy medicines and 
radiation therapy to kill the cancer cells in your body.  These chemotherapy drugs are so strong 
that they also kill many normal cells in your blood and bone marrow.  In a mini-transplant you 
will still get chemotherapy medicines and radiation therapy, but you will get smaller doses of 
these medicines.  A smaller amount of your cancer cells will be killed, but your body will be able 
to heal itself faster and attack the cancer cells.  Your doctors think that a mini-transplant is the 
best treatment for you.  They believe that it will increase your chance of cure.  
 
Cells from the donor’s bone marrow can be used in a transplant.  Bone marrow contains blood-
forming cells that can help re-grow your bone marrow after treatment with chemotherapy 
medicines and radiation.  Bone marrow cells can be donated by a volunteer in your family who 
has a similar type of bone marrow as you do.   
 Transplant Procedure 
Before the transplant, you will be given the drugs cyclophosphamide and fludarabine.  These 
drugs will be given through a central line – an IV that will be placed in your chest.  If you do not 
already have a central line, we will put one in  as a surgical procedure (you will be asleep for 
this).  A central line makes it easier for you to receive drugs and for drawing blood for tests (you 
will not be poked for blood or receive shots).  You will also get radiation to your whole body the 
day before your transplant.  After you have received these drugs and radiation, bone marrow will 
be given through your central line.  When the blood gets into your body, you may feel sick to 
your stomach but that will go away quickly.  You will be in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_808667].  You will need to 
be on a number of medications during your transplant, which will either be given through your 
line or will be taken by [CONTACT_1966].  
 
It will be necessary to check your blood and bone marrow after the transplant to make sure the 
bone marrow cells are growing in your body.  Your doctors will do blood tests and bone marrow 
tests. Blood tests will also be done by [CONTACT_808695].

ks/Discomforts   
The drugs and radiation may cause hair loss, nausea and vomiting, and diarrhea.  Your blood 
counts will fall and you may get fevers, infections or start bleeding.  You may also get mouth 
sores.  These are temporary and you will feel better as your new bone marrow grows.   
 
During the period your new bone marrow is growing back after the bone marrow transplant, you 
may need to get antibiotics since you will not be able to fight infections.  You may also need to 
get blood transfusions since your new bone marrow will not be making new blood cells right 
away.  It is possible that your new bone marrow will not grow back.  This is unlikely but if it did 
happen, it may even be necessary to do a second transplant.  You may get graft-versus-host 
disease (GVHD), which happens when transplanted cells attack your body causing skin rash, 
vomiting, diarrhea and liver problems.  These problems could be mild, or they could be very 
serious.  Your doctors will do their best to make you feel better and keep you safe. 
 
The above information has been explained to me.  My questions have been answered. 
 
I agree to participate in this study.

GUIDELINES FOR DONOR TYPI[INVESTIGATOR_808670]-haploidentical donor is defined as a family member who shares one complete HLA 
haplotype with the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841], and is variably HLA mismatched on the non-shared haplotype. A 
transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_808671]-haploidentical to each parent, to each child, and each sibling has a 
50% chance of being HLA-haploidentical to the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_808672], parents, and 
children is neither practical nor economically feasible.  Siblings are always typed first in the 
attempt to find an HLA-matched donor.  
 
If an HLA-matched donor is unavailable (Section 2.4), the following sequence is recommended: 
1. Revie
w HLA-typi[INVESTIGATOR_808673], as appropriate, to 
ascertain parental haplotypes.  If an HLA-haploidentical donor is identified, then proceed 
with criteria for “preferred donor” below.  If no HLA-haploidentical donor is identified 
and there are additional siblings or half-siblings willing to be typed for potential 
donation, then perform HLA and ABO typi[INVESTIGATOR_808674]-siblings.   
2. If 
a preferred donor  (defined below) is not identified from the siblings or half-siblings, 
then consider performing HLA and ABO typi[INVESTIGATOR_808675] ≤ 60 years of age and children  [ADDRESS_1117871] suitable donor. 
3. If
 a preferred or suitable donor is still not identified, perform HLA and ABO typi[INVESTIGATOR_808676] 60 years old.  
 
A
 preferred donor  is defined as one who meets all the following criteria: 
1. Med
ically and psychologically fit and willing to donate.   
2. If t
he patient is CMV seronegative, then the donor should be CMV seronegative.   
3. No maj
or ABO incompatibility:

of treatment-related mortality (TRM) at 100 days is less than or equal to 30% versus the 
alternative hypothesis that it is greater than or equal to 50%.  For the derivation of the 
uncensored SPRT, we will require that the type I error of the test be less than 5%, and that the 
test provide 80% power to reject the null hypothesis under a specified alternative that the true 
rate is 50%.  A maximum sample size of 50 patients will be permitted.

is put on trial and observed to fail, the cumulative sum of failure times, n

is recomputed, and 
plotted against the current sample size, n. 
 When this graph crosses the lower boundary, the null

The maximum sample size of [ADDRESS_1117876] Haplo – Protocol # [ADDRESS_1117877] a 
clinical study by [CONTACT_110912], and waiting until that individual is observed to 
fail.  We relax our assumptions as follows.  Firstly, each individual’s time on study will be 
computed as time from transplant to failure, or to the [ADDRESS_1117878] of relaxing these assumptions one at a time.  In a fixed sample size 
trial with uncensored exponential failure times, mean survival time is estimated by [CONTACT_627699], or total time on study divided by [CONTACT_627700].  
When censoring is introduced, the estimate becomes the total time on study divided by [CONTACT_110915] (non-censored) failures.  This suggests that in an exponential SPRT test 
modified to incorporate censoring, we replace the observed failure times, nT T T,.

 In 
practice, monitoring will be scheduled monthly after the start of enrollment to the study.  A 
further modification to the SPRT was to only use the lower boundary for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_627660] 100-day TRM rates. 
 Operating Characteristics of the Modified SPRT Test for Censored Exponential Data 
 
Recall that the uncensored SPRT targeted a drop in survival at Day 100 from 70% to 50%, with 
type I and II errors of 5% and 20%.  Since only the lower boundary is used for monitoring, the 
continuation region of the test was bounded below by a line with a slope of 0.541 and intercept 
of –2.256.  The effect of truncation is to reduce the power of the test.  In order to compensate for 
this, we raise the lower boundary to make it easier to cross.  Under the further assumption of 
uniform accrual over a three year period, and monthly interim analyses over the course of the 
study, the operating characteristics of the modified SPRT were obtained from a simulation study.  These simulation show that an intercept of –1.741, corresponding to setting parameters 
 and 
to
 10% and 15%, result in empi[INVESTIGATOR_110869] I and II error rates of  about 5% and 20%.

Wh
ile the motivation for this testing procedure is largely heuristic rather than theoretical, the 
simulation results validate the approach.  When the true rate of TRM on or before Day 100 was 
30%, the test crossed the lower boundary in 7119 of 100,000 replications, for an estimated type I 
error rate of 7%.  When the true rate of TRM on or before Day 100 was 50%, the test failed to 
cross the boundary in [ZIP_CODE] of 100,000 replications, for an estimated type II error rate of 14%.  
And on average, the boundary will be crossed at 18.[ADDRESS_1117880] Haplo – Protocol # 0603

CONTRAVE® Cardiovascular Safety Study, Final Protocol  
January 26, [ADDRESS_145824] is a fixed-dose combinati on of naltrexone hydrochloride (HCl), 8mg, and 
bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_16701], 90mg, for oral use via extended-re lease oral tablet. The product is marketed 
under the trade name [CONTACT_129271]® in the [LOCATION_002] (U.S.). It is a combination of an 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_9727] (naltr exone) and an aminoketone  antidepressant (bupropi [INVESTIGATOR_2394]). Each constituent 
active ingredient is available separately  in various doses and formulations.  
Following conventions within previous docum ents, hereafter we refer to the product 
CONTRAVE® as the branded product, under regulation. Use of CONTRAVE® or concomitant 
initiation of its constituent active ingredients, naltrexone and bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394], w ill be referred to as 
NB within this protocol. 
CONTRAVE® is indicated as an  adjunct to a reduced-calorie  diet and increased physical 
activity for chronic weight management in adu lts with an initial body mass index (BMI) of: 
 30 kg/m2 or greater (obese) or 
 27 kg/m2 or greater (overweight) in the pres ence of at least one weight-related 
comorbidity (e.g., hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, or dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035]).[ADDRESS_145825]® is recommended to be initiate d according to a dose- escalation schedule 
beginning with one tablet each morning in week one and increasing to up to two tablets twice 
daily beginning in week four.  
 
The labeled contraindications include known allergy to any ingredient within CONTRAVE®; 
uncontrolled hypertension; seizure disorders; an orexia nervosa or bul imia; undergoing abrupt 
discontinuation of alcohol; use of benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], barbiturates, or antiepi[INVESTIGATOR_006]; chronic 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441]; and taking currently, or within the past [ADDRESS_145826]® on cardiovascular morbidity  and mortality has no t been established. 
Additionally, the safety and effe ctiveness of CONTRAVE® in co mbination with other products 
intended for weight loss, including prescrip tion drugs, over-the-counter drugs, and herbal 
preparations, have not been esta blished. In this protocol, we propose to evaluate the potential 
effects of NB on cardiovascular endpoints.

Title: A Non-Interventional Study to Generate Real-World Evidence 
on the Cardiovascular Safety of CONTRAVE® in the [LOCATION_002] (U.S.)  
Background and Rationale: The fixed-dose co mbination of naltrexone 8mg and bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394] 
90mg extended-release oral tablet is marketed under the trade name [CONTACT_129271]® in the U.S. In this protocol, we propose to generate real-world eviden ce (RWE) from electronic health 
records (EHR) and linked cl aims data to assess the 
cardiovascular safety of CONT RAVE® and all NB in usual 
clinical practice. 
Research Question and Objectives: The main objective of this study is to compare the incidence of 
the primary endpoint (major ad verse cardiovascular events 
[MACE]) between initiators of NB  and initiators of an active 
comparator, lorcaserin (1.0).  
The study will also compare the incidence of the secondary 
endpoint (each component  of MACE) between initiators of NB 
and initiators of lorcaserin , overall and across subgroups of 
interest (1.1) 
This study includes three additi onal objectives to support the 
assessment of the robustness of the results for the primary and 
secondary endpoints: 
 To assess the comparability  of the results from the 
same EHR data to the resu lts of the 2018 randomized 
clinical trial assessing ca rdiovascular endpoints among 
lorcaserin users, in a manner consistent with the Randomized Controlled Trials Duplicated Using Prospective Longitudinal In surance Claims: Applying 
Techniques of Epi[INVESTIGATOR_129246] (RCT 
DUPLICATE) (2.0); 
 To quantify differences in  cardiovascular safety 
endpoints between the 2018 trial and the results of this EHR study (2.1); 
 To conduct other sensitivity analyses, including a self-
controlled, case-crossover analysis to quantify the 
potential effect of NB on MACE (2.2). 
Study Design: Retrospective,  new-user cohort study. 
Population: The primary study population in cludes initiators of NB or the 
active comparator, lorcaserin.  
Confidential Information 
CONTRAVE® Cardiovascular Safety Study, Final Protocol  
January 26, 2023 Page 7 of 29 
Inclusion and exclusion criteria for the main objective will 
ensure that only new users are included, and that the NB and comparison groups are comparable  on risk factors for MACE 
after application of propensity  score (PS) matching weights. 
Inclusion and exclusi on criteria for the additional objectives 
will align with those used in the 2018 trial assessing cardiovascular endpoints among lorcaserin users, insofar as the data support a comparab le replication.  
Variables: The key variables are initiation of NB, initiation of lorcaserin 
(active comparator),  time on treatment, and the endpoint of 
MACE. The individual compone nts of MACE will also be 
quantified. Covariates will be derived from clinical 
measurements, past medical hist ory, diagnoses, observations, 
and prescription records. Multiple imputation will be applied to address missing data, coupled with PS analyses to address 
confounding. 
Data Sources: EHR and linked claims da ta from Arcadia Data Research. The 
data currently cover approximate ly 75 million people in the 
U.S. 
Study Size: There are approximately 37, 000 apparent NB initiators in the 
Arcadia data.  
There are approximately 16,000 appa rent lorcaserin initiators. 
Data Analysis: Descriptive statistics of  the study cohorts, multiple imputation 
of missing covariates, estimati on of crude incidence rates of 
MACE among initiators of NB, a nd adjusted incidence rates of 
MACE after applying PS matching weights will be calculated (1.0 and 1.1). Analogs to inten tion-to-treat and per-protocol 
cohort analyses will be conducted. The analysis will also follow the principles of the RCT DUPLICATE Initiative (2.0 and 2.1) to assess the concordance between findings in an EHR study to those in the lorcaserin cardiovascular safety endpoints 
trial. In addition, we will conduct a case-crossover study to assess the effects of NB on MACE  (2.2) and other sensitivity 
analyses.

4 RATIONALE AND BACKGROUND 
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  approved  CONTRAVE® on September 10, 
2014, for chronic weight management in  obese adults (body mass index [BMI] ≥30 kg/m2) and 
in those who are overweight (BMI ≥27 kg/m2) with at least one weight-related comorbidity 
(e.g., hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, or  dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035]). CONTR AVE® is used as an 
adjunct to a reduced-calorie diet and increa sed physical activity. The labeling indication 
includes two Limitations of Use, one of whic h states that the effe ct of  CONTRAVE® on 
cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not be en established. Since 2014, real-world data 
(RWD) on NB have accumulated through use in clin ical practice and afford an opportunity to 
generate RWE on the drug’s safety profile. This  protocol proposes the generation of RWE from 
EHRs and linked claims data to assess the cardiovasc ular safety of NB in us ual clinical practice.  
 
We also include several additional objectives; prime among them is asse ssing the comparability 
of findings using RWD to those generated from a clinical trial. RWD studies are often more 
cost-effective and feasible comp ared to their RCT counterparts.  When sufficiently calibrated, 
RWD studies can reach similar conclusions to  RCTs and can contribute meaningfully to 
evidence generation for therapeutics in real-world clinical practice2,3. The RCT DUPLICATE 
Initiative supports this goal a nd was created to quantify differences between RCT findings and 
corresponding RWD replications, to understand the types of research questions suitable for 
RWD, and to understand the methods that should be used for such studies. Comparisons to 
trial results can help to assess and quantify th e presence of (potential) biases in RWD studies.  
This protocol was developed in accordance with  regulatory guidance, draft and international 
society guidelines, and frameworks for obser vational database studies involving RWE4-6.

5 RESEARCH QUESTIONS AND OBJECTIVES 
The study will assess whether patients who initiate tr eatment with NB are at an elevated risk of 
MACE compared with patients who initiated trea tment with lorcaserin, an active comparator 
chosen to reduce potential confounding7,8. Lorcaserin was approved in the U.S. under the brand 
names BELVIQ® and BELVIQ XR ® for the same indication as NB, and withdrawn from the 
market due to cancer safety concerns in [ZIP_CODE]-11. Lorcaserin is not believed to have adverse 
effects on cardiovascular outcomes. The CAME LLIA-TIMI 61 trial was a comparison of 
lorcaserin relative to placebo in overweight and obese patients with cardiovascular disease and 
cardiovascular disease risk factor s. The trial found no difference in the rate of cardiovascular 
events12. 
 
The study’s main objective is to compare the incidence of the primary endpoint (MACE) 
between initiators of NB and in itiators of lorcaserin (1.0). The study will also compare the 
incidence of the secondary endpoint, consisting of each component  of MACE, between initiators 
of NB and initiators of lorcaserin , across the following subgroups (1.1): 
 Patients with obesity (i.e., most recent BMI measurement ≥30 kg/m2); 
 Patients with a diagnosis of hype rtension, regardless of BMI; 
 Patients with a diagnosis of type 2 di abetes mellitus, regardless of BMI; 
 Patients with a diagnosis of dys lipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], regardless of BMI. 
 
The study’s additional objectives aimed at te sting the robustness of  the methods are: 
 To assess the comparability of findings fro m an EHR study to those of a [ADDRESS_145829] DUPLICATE Initiative (2.0); 
 To quantify differences in car diovascular safety endpoints be tween the clinical trial and 
the results of this EHR study (2.1); 
 To conduct other sensitivity analyses, incl uding a self-contro lled, case-crossover 
analysis to quantify the potential effect of NB on MACE (2.2).

of NB will be identified between September 2014 and February 2020. Contemporaneously, we 
will identify all lorcaserin users between 2012 and 2020. A self-controlled, case-crossover 
design will be used for the sensitivity analysis (2.2). 
 
6.2 Settings 
The cohorts for all study objectives will be draw n from a large EHR data source, representing a 
geographically diverse patient population. The data will include diagnoses, procedures, 
medications (prescribed and administered), clinic al measures (biometric and laboratory values), 
and observations derived from clinical notes. A subset of the populat ion will have linked, 
adjudicated claims data availabl e to support sensitivity analyses.  
EHR data, generated from routine clinical care offer timely clin ical information not typi[INVESTIGATOR_129247], including info rmation on patient attrib utes, observations from 
physicians’ notes, patient symptoms and history, diagnostic information, and planned and actual 
treatments, and prescription medicines not covered by [CONTACT_129260] (e.g., CONTRAVE®). 
Notably, EHR data include measures of BMI for descriptive analysis  and evaluation as a 
potential confounder and effect modifier. Th ese EHR data will be linked to proprietary 
information from First Databank to  identify medications of interest accurately, including NB. 
 
6.3 Inclusion Criteria 
For the main objective (1.0, 1.1), patients are el igible if they meet the following inclusion 
criteria:

6.5 Variables 
6.5.1 Exposure 
Initiation of NB and lorcaserin will be identifi ed using Hierarchical Ingredient Code Lists 
(HICLs) from First Databank. If necessary, indivi dual searches of National Drug Codes (NDCs) 
and free-text strings wi ll also be used. See Figure [ADDRESS_145838]® Cardiovascular Safety Study, Final Protocol  
January 26, 2023 Page 15 of 29 
For the cohort, among the subset of patients w ith EHR data whose records can be linked to 
health insurance claims, we will assess the conc ordance between receiving a prescription for NB 
and lorcaserin (in the EHR) and filli ng the prescription (in the claims).  
 
The time of entry into the NB cohort will be the date of firs t prescription for those taking  
CONTRAVE®, the date of the second overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_129250], or the date of first prescription for 
lorcaserin from date of approval in the U.S. to withdrawal from the market, as applicable. 
 
In the case-crossover study, a 90-day hazard window will immediately precede the index event 
date within which the occurrence of a prescrip tion or dispensing will define exposure status. 
Similarly, a 90-day referent window will preced e the hazard window, with exposure status 
designated comparably. A 30-day washout window  between the hazard and referent windows 
will be used to mitigate any carryover e ffects from the prior exposure. Please see Figure 2  for a 
visual depi[INVESTIGATOR_129251]-crossover study design.

6.5.2 Outcomes and follow-up 
  
The primary study endpoint is MACE, defined as the composite of:  
 
 Medically attended non-fatal acu te myocardial infarction; 
 Medically attended non-fatal stroke;  
 Cardiovascular-related death. 
 The secondary endpoints are: 
 
 Individual components of MACE , analyzed separately, as (1) medically attended non-
fatal acute myocardial infarction; (2) medi cally attended non-fatal stroke; and (3) 
cardiovascular-related death.

In accordance with the CAMELLIA-TIMI 61 trial,  the comprability study will examine safety 
endpoints for the secondary obj ectives (2.0 and 2.1).  
 
The safety endpoint was de fined as a composite of: 
 
 Cardiovascular death; 
 Myocardial infarction; 
 Stroke12.  
 
For all study objectives, information on myocardi al infarction and stroke will be obtained from 
the EHR data, while information on death will be obtained from Datavant . Datavant compi[INVESTIGATOR_129252] s ources, obituaries, newspapers, an d claims data for more than 
90% of the U.S. population. Cause of death will be ascertained from the subset of individuals 
whose records can be linked to death certificates; otherwise, diagnoses adjacent to death will be 
identified, as feasible, using information from the EHR (e.g., cardiovascular-related 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_129253]).  
 
A U.S.-licensed physician consultant, blinded to exposure, will review the detailed 
chronological listing of indivi dual-level EHR data (and claims, where relevant) of a randomly 
selected subset of apparent MACE cases to determine whether MACE occurred. The 
adjudication process will compare the operati onal definition of MACE in the EHR to the 
physician’s professional judgement and the occurrence of MACE in the EHR and claims data. If 
the initial EHR-based definiti on of MACE does not meet a pre-specified threshold for 
concordance, then adjustments to  the initial list of diagnoses a nd procedure codes will be made 
to improve the accuracy of the operational definition of MACE14,15.  
 
Follow-up time will be calculated separately for each study endpoint. Patie nts will be followed 
starting the day after initial exposure until the first of the following censoring events: (1) the 
study endpoint of interest, (2) deat h (for those who do not have the endpoint of interest), or (3) 
end of available data for those who do not have the event of interest (i.e., censoring due to end 
of available EHR data). Person-time will be ca lculated by [CONTACT_129261] 
(day 0) to the date of the first relevant censoring event. 
 
To test the robustness of assumptions about th e date of censoring, analyses with differing 
censoring definitions will be perf ormed, and estimates compared:  
 
 To assess whether the censoring date needs to  be adjusted, the physician consultant will 
review a random sample of pa tient health profiles to determine whether there is a clear 
indicator of censoring. Insofar as there appear s to be a clear indicator of censoring, the 
physician will record this date (blinded to expos ure), and this information will be used to 
Confidential Information 
CONTRAVE® Cardiovascular Safety Study, Final Protocol  
January 26, [ADDRESS_145839] the censoring date. Ind eed, this information may be tr eated as an annotation for a 
machine learning model. 
 To account for a patient still being on the in surance plan but not accessing the healthcare 
system, adjust the end of follow-up to be [ADDRESS_145840] 
healthcare encounter in the EHR.   
 To assess the reliability of our method for computing time until censoring in the EHR, 
compare follow-up times in the EHR to those observed in the claims enrollment files 
using a subset of those with  EHR and claims data.   
 To test robustness of the me thod for computing follow-up tim e in the EHR, compute the 
distribution of follow-up times based on en rollment spans within the subset of 
individuals with claims and EHR data a nd apply the median follow-up time within 
populations with particul ar health profiles.  
 To implement a more specific definition of follow-up time, assume that a last healthcare 
encounter with a primary care provider, endoc rinologist, or geriatri c care provider in 
combination with no death information is the end of enrollment.  
6.5.3 Covariates 
A range of demographics will be assessed for each patient at cohort entry, including the 
following: 
 
 Age; 
 Sex; 
 Race/ethnicity.

o Antipsychotics; 
o Beta-blockers; 
o Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g ., propafenone and flecainide); 
o Digoxin; 
o Antiplatelets. 
 
A set of relevant laboratory test results and biometric values will be assessed during the 180 
days before cohort entry, including the following:  
 
 BMI; 
 Blood glucose or HbA1c; 
 Liver function; 
 Dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_125270]; 
 Resting heart rate; 
 Respi[INVESTIGATOR_697]; 
 Systolic blood pressure; 
 Diastolic blood pressure;

7.2 Datavant Death Data 
We will link data from Arcadia to death data from Datavant, a private U.S. data curator, 
specializing in organizing health data17. Datavant’s mortality databa se contains information on 
deceased individuals in the U.S. and Canada18. Datavant’s Death Index contains information on 
individual deaths incl uding year and month of death, ge nder, and cause of death, where 
available. Information is obtaine d from the Social Security Admi nistration’s Death Master File 
in addition to private obituaries, newspapers  and claims data, and is updated on a weekly 
basis18,19. In 2018, information was present for just over 2.4 million deaths18.  
In order to de-identify records,  names, addresses, and social security numbers are removed in 
addition to modifications such as changing a pe rson’s date of birth to  year of birth alone19. 
Datavant’s proprietary technology adds encrypted tokens  to each record, constructed from the 
underlying personally identifiable  information. Since these tokens correspond to unique 
individuals, they can be used to link death information to other health-related datasets.

adjudicated claims data at some  point in time. Seventy percent of apparent initiators were 
women. 
 
8.2 Ranges of Statisti cal Power for MACE 
In a similar population of overweight/ obese individuals, Ritchey et al.20 found that the incidence 
rate of MACE was estimated at 2/1,000 pers on-years among individuals unexposed to weight 
loss drugs (95% confidence interv al [CI], 1.85–2.17). Guided by [CONTACT_129262], Figure [ADDRESS_145843]® Cardiovascular Safety Study, Final Protocol

9.2 Missing Data 
Some biometric variables within the EHR (e.g., la boratory values, such as HbA1c) are expected 
to be missing in a non-random way. We will em ploy multiple imputation methods to address 
missing covariate data at baseli ne by [CONTACT_129263] s (e.g., within periods of one, 
three or six months) for ascertainment of im portant missing values. If multiple results are 
available in an interval, we w ill select the valid observation that  is most proximal to the cohort 
entry date. 
 Consistent with our previous res earch on missing data within EHRs
21,22, we will then use 
multiple imputation methods to impute missing values within in tervals with no observed values 
for a given patient. To account for the uncerta inty of imputed values, we will produce [ADDRESS_145846] 
errors. That is, the full analysis will be conducte d within each of the 10 complete datasets, the 
results will be averaged across the datasets, and th e measures of statistical uncertainty (e.g., CIs) 
corrected for the imputati on. Because of the number of possi ble covariates requiring imputation, 
we will use a fully conditional sp ecification of the multiple im putation procedure (i.e., chained 
equations), which does not requir e the stringent assumption that some models make about the 
joint distribution of missing covariates23. 
 
The multiple imputation procedur e reduces the potentia l for missing data bi as at the population 
level and relaxes the assumptions necessary to interpret results as  unbiased estimates. [CONTACT_129272] 
designed and successfully conducted a cohort study with a large EHR using these techniques, 
and the results of that study were similar to trial results of the same comparisons21.  
 
 
9.3 Crude Incidence Rate Differen ce (IRD) and Incidence Rate Ratio 
(IRR) Estimates 
The incidence rate for each group is the cumulative number of observed endpoint events, 
divided by [CONTACT_129264]-years of follow-up. Th e crude IRD is the absolute difference in the 
observed incidence rate between initiators of NB a nd initiators of lorcaserin, with no adjustment 
for differences in patient ch aracteristics between groups. Th e crude IRR is the relative 
difference (i.e., ratio) in the obser ved incidence rate of initiators  of NB, divided by [CONTACT_129265], wi th no adjustment for differences in patient 
characteristics between groups.

9.4 PS Matching Weights 
PS matching weights will be used to cont rol for confounding betw een treatment groups24,25. A 
logistic regression model will be used to estimate  the predicted probability of treatment with NB 
versus treatment with lorcaserin, conditional on pr e-specified covariates. Each patient’s PS, or 
predicted probability from the model, will be th e probability that the pa tient received NB. The 
complement of each patient’s PS (i.e., 1-PS) will be the probability that the patient received 
lorcaserin. Each patient will be assigned a matc hing weight, which is a function of their PS and 
the treatment received. The numerator of the ma tching weight is the smaller of the PS or the 
complement of the PS (1-PS). The denominator is the PS if the patient received NB, and it is 1-
PS if the patient received lorcaserin. For example,  a patient with a PS value of 0.6 (1-PS = 0.4) 
who received NB would have a ma tching weight of 0.4/0.[ADDRESS_145847] ate, care intensity, and surveillance.  
 
Matching weights are the weighti ng analog of 1:1 PS matching, but  include the entire eligible 
patient population, are more statis tically efficien t than matching, and pr oduce better balance on 
covariates. Thus, matching weights standardize the distri bution of patient characteristics to the 
area of common support (or empi[INVESTIGATOR_129254]26) in which patients could have reasonably 
received either treatment. 
 
9.[ADDRESS_145848] and IRR Estimates 
This study will include analogs of intention-to -treat (ITT) and per-protocol analyses, in 
accordance with clinical trial conventions. Both  analyses estimate the effect of NB on the 
incidence of MACE relative to comparators, but differ in the handli ng of person-time, as 
described below. We adopt the term ITT a nd refer to the per-pro tocol analogue as the as-treated  
analysis.  
 
9.5.1 Intention-to-Treat Analysis 
The ITT defines each day of follow-up for ever yone according to their exposure status at the 
time of cohort entry (e.g., initiation of NB). Clas sification of person-time in the ITT analysis is 
subject to exposure misclassificati on as individuals discontinue tr eatment or switch to the other 
study drug before their end of follow-up. In cont rast, the ITT estimate preserves the balance in

starting treatment – or intending to start tr eatment – on the rate of the outcomes.  
 
9.5.[ADDRESS_145850] of being on (o r off) the treatment on the rate of the outcomes. 
Such estimates are often desirabl e for drug safety questions becau se they avoid misclassification 
of exposure that arises in ITT analysis; how ever, the balance introduced at baseline by [CONTACT_129266] e as patients switch non-randomly  among different study drugs. 
Therefore, the ITT and as-treated  analyses are best interpreted together. 
 
To obtain the hazard ratios necessary to compare trial results to those obtained through use of 
RWD, we will use an ITT analysis for the primary analyses, and as-treated for sensitivity 
analyses, as was done in th e CAMELLIA-TIMI 61 trial. 
 
9.5.3 Statistical Mode l for Cohort Analysis 
 
For all primary study objectives, weighted Poisso n models will be used to estimate IRDs and 
IRRs (and 95% CIs), adjusted for all covariates included in the PS m odel. Robust variance 
estimators will be used to account for the weig hting. Analyses will be conducted amongst the 
overall NB cohort and also strati fied by [CONTACT_129267] ® and those with overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_007], 
concomitant use of Nalt rexone and Bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394].  
 
For the secondary objective of assessing the comp arability of findings in a RWD cohort with the 
lorcaserin clinical trial, we will conduct a time -to event analysis in the propensity-score matched 
cohort. We will produce hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals using a weighted Cox 
proportional-hazards model with the stra tification factor as a covariate. 
 
Additionally, informed by [CONTACT_129268], we will examine 
the following metrics in concert to assess the comparability in findings between the 
CAMELLIA-TIMI 61 trial and findings in the data:  
 
 Regulatory agreement, which is the ability  of the study using RWD to replicate the 
direction and magnitude of the RCT; 
Confidential Information 
CONTRAVE® Cardiovascular Safety Study, Final Protocol  
January 26, 2023 Page 25 of 29 
 Estimate agreement, defined as a HR from the replication study that was within the 95% 
CI for the RCT estimate; 
 Standardized difference between  the RCT and replication effect estimate, with a p-value 
< 0.[ADDRESS_145851] window to the odds of exposure in the referent window (i.e., od ds ratio) for the case 
cross-over design.  
 
9.6 Quality Control 
The study will be carried out according to Expone nt’s Quality Management System (QMS), 
with specific procedures being consistent with the International Society for 
Pharmacoepi[INVESTIGATOR_623]’s Gu idelines for Good Pharma coepi[INVESTIGATOR_61272] 
(http://www.pharmacoepi.org), as well as the FDA Best Practice Guidance document 
(http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComp lianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/)4-6,27. In 
particular, the QMS at Exponent ensures that  processes and deliverables are documented, 
reviewed, and validated in sufficient detail to allow for subseque nt re-examination or 
replication. Exponent’s quality management system is independe ntly assessed against the most 
recognized and comprehensive in ternational standard for qua lity management systems, ISO 
9001. Exponent complies with the ISO 9001:[ADDRESS_145852]; the ISO [ZIP_CODE]:[ADDRESS_145853]; U.S. 
Code of Federal Regulations, Title 10, Part 50, Appendix B; U.S. Code of Federal Regulations, 
Title 10, Part 21; and the respective advertisi ng policy for each registration, accreditation, and 
approval. 
 
The core project team will consist of at least one  Principal Scientist who will provide scientific 
oversight of the study, a senior epi[INVESTIGATOR_129255]-to-day aspects of the 
scientific conduct of the study, research analyst(s), and a pr oject manager. Project management 
is integrated into the project team and supports  the development of the project plan, monitoring 
timelines and budgets, s ecuring appropriate study resources,  and facilitati ng completion of 
contracted deliverables. In addition, Exponent  staff members will support the project team by 
[CONTACT_129269], including assurance of appropriate data confidentiality, storage, and management.

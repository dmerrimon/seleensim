Answer/Response:   
Cirrhosis is known to cause various end -organ dysfunction, most notably the 
hepatorenal and hepatopulmonary syndromes. However, the increased recognition of adrenal 
insufficiency in cirrhotic patients has led to postulation about the presence of a so -called 
“hepatoadrenal syndrome1.” While originally this syndrome was recognized in cirrhotic patients 
with sepsis and shock states1,2, further investigation has also identified adrenal insufficiency in 
cirrhotic patients with variceal bleeding3 as well as stable patients4. Although there is 
controversy about the best diagno stic test to assess adrenal insufficiency in cirrhotic patients5,6, 
it is well established that cirrhotic patients with adrenal insufficiency have increased mortality, 
particularly as they become more decompensated7. 
In addition to this endocrinological co mplication, cirrhosis also has a profound effect on 
a patient’s hematologic parameters. In a study of rheologic properties of 38 patients (18 
cirrhotic – mostly of cryptogenic origin, 20 control), cirrhotic patients were noted to have 
increased erythrocyte  rigidity and decreased plasma and blood viscosity8.  The authors argued 
that their findings were related to a deficiency of high -density lipoprotein (HDL), although the 
correlation was admittedly weak in their study. A follow -up study by [CONTACT_572521] -hepatic 
cirrhosis; importantly, they noted the prior association between alcoholic liver disease and 
development of macrocytosis as a function of lecithin -cholesterol ac etyltransferase (LCAT) 
enzyme deficiency9. This enzyme is responsible for esterification of cholesterol and subsequent 
incorporation into normal red cell membranes. Interestingly, its deficiency is directly 
manifested as an altered free cholesterol to phos pholipid ratio10, with the increased cholesterol 
fraction causing the membrane rigidity previously described.  
Another abnormality well documented in cirrhotic patients, more frequently in patients 
with advanced disease, is spur cell anemia. Although first  described in alcoholic cirrhosis, it is 
seen in all etiologies and is a poor prognostic marker. A spur cell burden of ≥5% was found to 
be associated with a 67% [ADDRESS_751688] dec reased red blood cell (RBC) lifespan and are transfusion resistant as 
transfused RBCs quickly acquire the pathologic morphology. Spur cells are thought to occur 
secondary to red cell membrane abnormalities secondary to altered cholesterol composition, 
similar to the abnormal erythrocyte rigidity rheologic property described above. Interestingly, 
the lecithin -cholesterol acetyltransferase enzyme has been investigated as a potential key 
factor in spur cell anemia. A [ADDRESS_751689] of a surrogate method involving change in serum free cholesterol after 6 -hour incubation. 
Lower levels of LCAT were found in patients with spur cells compared to normal controls; 
however,  there was only a weak association with red ce ll lipid content.  
Furthermore, platelet dysfunction in cirrhosis has also been tied to lipid abnormalities. A 
review of dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_572518], similar to erythrocytes, 
have an imbalanced cholesterol to phospholipid r atio and associated impaired aggregation13. 
Thus, the deficient primary hemostasis noted in cirrhotic patients may not be just a function of

Page Number: 2 of 8 thrombocytopenia itself but also an intrinsic abnormality of platelet function related to a 
disruption in normal cholesterol pathways.   
It has been demonstrated that LCAT is a key enzyme for many homeostatic functions 
within the human body and its deficie nt production in cirrhosis appears to correlate with 
various hematologic abnormalities. However, it may very well also play an important role in 
adrenal steroidogenesis and help explain the so called “hepatoadrenal” syndrome that has 
begun to permeate thro ugh the literature. More importantly, however, is that cholesterol 
esterification levels, a surrogate marker of LCAT enzymatic activity, are directly associated with 
mortality and thus can serve as a prognostic indicator. A recent study by [CONTACT_572522].[ADDRESS_751690] mortality.  
Objectives/Hypothesis  
Answer/Response:  
The hepatoadrenal syndrome has been well described in the literature and is known to 
be associated with poorer outcomes in both stable and critically ill cirrhotic patients. In chronic 
liver disease, adrenal (and more specifically cortisol) insufficiency is thought to be a by[CONTACT_572523]. Studies to date 
have implicated lecithin -cholesterol acetyltransferase (LCAT) as the key enzyme which is 
deficient in some cirrhotic pa tients, leading to an impaired ability to esterify cholesterol and 
thus a loss of normal cellular functioning and membrane stability. We seek to quantify this LCAT 
deficiency in a cohort of cirrhotic patients and demonstrate its association with various 
abnormal physiologies associated with chronic liver disease, including spur cell anemia, low HDL 
levels, and adrenal insufficiency.

2.  What are the statistical considerations for the protocol?  
Answer/Response:  
Subjects will be classified as adrenally sufficient or insufficient on the basis of standard -
dose cortisol stimulation test. Variables of interest for comparison between the groups include 
MELD score, Child -Turcotte -Pugh (CTP) classification, high -density lipoprotein (HDL) levels, 
prese nce of spur cell anemia, serum cholesterol ester percentage (surrogate for LCAT 
enzymatic activity), cortisol binding globulin levels, and free cortisol levels. Student’s t -test and 
Chi Square tests will be utilized to determine significance; a p -value <0. 05 will be used as our 
threshold for significance. If multiple factors are found to be significantly different in a 
univariate fashion between classification groups, a multivariate logistic regression analysis will 
be performed for adjusted analysis. We wi ll also seek to define any correlations between 
variables. Furthermore, we will assess correlation between MELD score and serum cholesterol 
ester percentage, spur cell anemia, HDL levels, cortisol binding globulin levels, and free cortisol 
levels; similar correlate analysis will be done using CTP classification instead of MELD score.  
Prevalence of adrenal insufficiency (AI) in cirrhosis varies widely based on several 
factors, including severity of liver disease (i.e. MELD score or CTP classification) and th e testing 
modality used to assess for AI. Given that admitted patients to UVA are typi[INVESTIGATOR_572519] B or C, we 
expect the incidence to be about 33%. Thus, [ADDRESS_751691], assuming a 20% dropout 
rate to lead to 100 patients completing study protocol.  
 
3.  Provide a justification for the sample size used in this protocol.   
Answer/Response:  
Given that admitted patients to UVA are typi[INVESTIGATOR_572519] B or C, we expect the incidence of 
adrenal insufficiency to be about 33%. We feel [ADDRESS_751692] for correlation between adrenal insufficiency, low seru m cholesterol ester 
percentage, and spur cell anemia. There is no current literature upon which to do a formal 
power calculation (although low levels of cholesterol esterification is a well -established near -
universal metabolic finding in cirrhotic patients ), but this sample size would allow for adequate 
size comparator groups and decrease the likelihood of a Type II statistical error.  
 
4.  What is your plan for primary variable analysis?  
Answer/Response:   
Our primary outcome of interest is comparing preval ence of cholesterol esterification 
deficiency and spur cell anemia in cirrhotic patients with and without adrenal insufficiency.  
 
5.  What is your plan for secondary variable analysis?  
Answer/Response:  
- Demonstrate association between deficiency in cholest erol esterification and presence 
of spur cell anemia

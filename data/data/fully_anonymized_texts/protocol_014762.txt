Background and Introduction:  
Obesity among youth in the [LOCATION_002], particularly those of low -socioeconomic 
status (SES), is a major public health concern that puts youth at risk for poor 
cardiovascular health (CVH).1-[ADDRESS_1260253] in part, to differential 
delivery of and compliance to behavior change prescriptions.4 Environmental barriers  
(e.g., poor access to safe places play and healthy food outlets) more prevalent in low -
SES neighborhoods may prevent patients from being active and eating healthy  which 
can improve CVH.5-7 Health equity depends on the successful implementation and 
sustainment of tailored, evidence- based interventions to address risk behaviors in 
settings ( e.g., clinics) that reach a large number of adolescents.  
Social determinants ( e.g., social and built environments)  have an important impact on 
health outcomes.8-10 Yet these factors are often ignored at the point -of-care. Providers 
lack time and patient - and community -specific data necessary to provide tailored, 
evidence- based care within their routine practice.11 Interactive Behavior Change 
Technology enables a data -driven, patient -centered approach to prevention that has 
potential to be scaled across clinics, populations and disease types.12 Increasing 
awareness of community resources ( e.g., parks, community centers, farmer’ s markets) 
has resulted in weight loss in children.13 Yet, an EHR -compatible tool has not been used 
to provide adolescents with patient -centered, community resources at the clinic visit. 
This research will fill this critical gap with our novel Patient -centered Real -timE 
interVENTion (PREVENT) tool.  
Significance:   
Only 4% of adolescents meet the American Heart Association’s Life Simple 7 CVH 
metrics ( e.g., obesity, physical activity and healthy food intake) that are important for 
preventing cardiovascular disease, and this percentage was even lower among those of 
low-SES. 3,7,14- 16 Increasing physical activity and healthy food intake using eff ective 
interventions that are scalable, sustainable, and elicit equitable change across 
populations are necessary to address the approximately 19% of adolescents with 
obesity .[ADDRESS_1260254] the potential to 
reduce poor CVH during well -child visits.17 Yet, providers lack the training and time to 
identify and address health behavior issues.18,19 Evidence- based behavior change has 
not been adopted into practice, despi[INVESTIGATOR_899031] ( e.g., Interactive 
Behavior Change Technology) that can facilitate this with little burden.20  
To achieve health equity, behavior change interventions should address the env ironment  
surrounding at -risk youth.21 The ability to be physically active and improve healthy food 
intake is dependent on the built environment22-24 and/or knowledge of existing resou rces 
and infrastructure ( e.g., transportation) to access resources, particularly for low -SES 
populations.25-28 Linking youth and their families to resources ( e.g., parks, c ommunity 
centers, healthy food outlets) is a practice that aligns with the American Academy of 
Pediatrics recommendations for community pediatricians29 and the Chronic Care 
Model.[ADDRESS_1260255] linked patients to community 
resources and show promising weight loss in adults and children.13,31,32 Yet, taking such

interventions, coupled  with evidence- based behavior change strategies and integrat ing 
them  into a clinical practice workflow has not been tested in adolescents.  
 
1.0 Study Aims: 
The proposed research will test the feasibility of administering PREVENT, a pragmatic, 
equitable approach to prevention, in the Late Effects Clinic at St. Louis Children’s 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_899032]. Louis Children’s Specialty Care Center  (CSCC)  to prepare for 
subsequent implementation and dissemination.  The central hypothesis  is that PREVENT 
will improve patients’ attitudes toward behavior change recommendations, to better 
adher e to recommendations and improve CVH.  
Aim 1.  Determine barriers to current and futur e implementation of the PREVENT tool 
(e.g., usability, acceptability, motivation, workflow compatibility) to inform adoption and 
maintenance.  
Aim 2.  Assess the impact of the PREVENT tool on patients’ attitudes toward behavior 
change recommendations and on the control of CVH risk factors ( e.g., body mass index 
[BMI], physical activity and healthy food intake).  
2.0 Summary of Study Plan  
Fifty adolescents aged 1 2 to 19 
years at risk for poor CVH (BMI ≥  
85th percentile) will be recruited 
over a 9- month period ( Table 1 ) 
from the Late Effects Clinic and 
randomized to intervention or wait-list control ( Figure 1 ). 
Provid er’s and patient’s 
perceptions of barriers to 
implementation and maintenance 
of PREVENT ( e.g., usability, 
acceptability, motivation for use, 
workflow compatibility) will be 
examined using: 1) surveys administered to all providers at clinic; 2) semi -structu red 
interviews with 5 -10 diverse providers ( e.g., physicians , nurses, clinic staff , clinical 
research associates ); and 3) two focus groups, one with patients (n=10) and one with 
parents (n=10) ( Aim 1 ). These evaluations will be guided by [INVESTIGATOR_21392] -AIM
33 and administered 
following the intervention period. Implementation ( e.g., intervention delivery, fidelity, time

of use) will be examined using direct observation and audio recordings of [ADDRESS_1260256] behavior change 
recommendations and risk factors (BMI z -score, cholesterol, blood pressure, physical 
activity and food intake) wi ll be measured using surveys, physical activity tracking 
devices (accelerometers) and EHR -data extraction at baseline and 3 -months ( Aim 2 ). 
An advisory board will be established and meet bi -annually to provide adolescent (n=5), 
parent (n=5) and provider (n=5) perspectives  on study implementation and  inform 
revisions to PREVENT.

4.0 Study Procedures  
 4.1 Recruitment   
4.1.1 Patient  recruitment.  A designee at the clinic will query the clinic’s EHR 
using inclusion/ exclusion criteria to develop a list of eligible patients  with contact

information  (parent contact [CONTACT_899038] ≤ 18 years) . Study 
staff will mail a letter informing them of the study and then recruit via telephone. 
The letter will be addressed to the parent/guardian if the patient is ≤18 years of 
age; otherwise, the letter will be addressed to the patient. The recruiter will 
describe the study and administer a phone -based screener. If interested and 
eligible , patients will be consented and enrolled.   
 A subset of patients (n=10)  and their parent (n=10)  will be recruited to participate 
in a focus group discussions following the intervention period. Recruitment will 
leverage contact [CONTACT_899039].  
 
4.1.2 Provider recruitment.  The study team will present the study  and review 
the consent document  at the clinic’s monthly research meeting and allow time for 
providers to ask questions.  If an eligible provider is not in attendance, the 
provider will be contact[CONTACT_899040].   
 4.[ADDRESS_1260259] information 
provided on the consent document to follow -up with additional questions prior to 
completing the consent.  If the patient is 18 years or younger, we will ensure that 
the parent is on the phone while we review the consent document.  If the parent is 
not available, we will call back to discuss the consent form. Following this 
conversation, an electronic consent (developed in REDCap with guidance from 
the ICTS mHealth Research Core) will be emailed. The study team will send a 
test email in a secure manner (i.e., [secure] in subject line) prior to sending 
consent to verify t he participant’s identify. The email will instruct the participant to 
send all information as a response to this thread and not to remove the “[secure]” 
from the subject line. All future email correspondence will follow this protocol. If 
the patient is [ADDRESS_1260260] copy of the 
signed document. Following consent, the patient will complete baseline 
measures (questionnaires administered electronically or by [CONTACT_2319]; accelerometers administered by [CONTACT_2319]). Following baseline measurement, patients will be 
randomized to intervention or wait -list control and att end their clinic visit.  The 
study staff will call the participant one- week before their clinic visit to remind them 
of their appointment time, give them details about the appointment and address 
any barriers they may be facing to  complete baseline measurem ents.   Follow -up

measures will be administered  immediately following the clinic visit (within 48 
hours) and 3-months after the clinic visit electronically and by [CONTACT_2319]. Patients will 
only return to the clinic for a routine visit at 3- months if it meets thei r standard of 
care based on their baseline clinical values for CVH risk. Wait-list control will be 
sent tailored prescriptions via the PREVENT tool following the completion of 
follow -up measurements. Participants will receive up to $[ADDRESS_1260261] s 
for participation.  Participants will receive $ 25 after baseline, $25 after 3 -month 
follow -up and $25 for wearing an accelerometry device to measure their physical 
activity.   
 
Patients (n=10) and their parents (n=10) who participate in focus groups will 
provide an additional written consent in- person prior to the start of the discussion. 
Consent will be administered in a single room with patients and parents. Once 
consent is administered, patients and parents will be divided into two private 
rooms to conduct separate focus groups simultaneously.  
 
  4.2.3 Provider enrollment  
Following the presentation of the study  at the clinic’s monthly research meeting, 
all eligible providers will be sent electronic consent documents and provided w ith 
[CONTACT_14905]’s contact [CONTACT_3031] (phone and email) to ask additional questions . If 
consent is not received, the study team will follow -up with providers via email or

complete a survey assessing their health behaviors and atti tudes and wear an 
accelerometry device for 7 days prior to the clinic visit.  Parents/legal guardians of 
study participants will be asked to complete a baseline demographics survey 
delivered electronically before the clinic visit or completed in the waiting  room at 
the clinic visit.  In addition, study staff will extrac t EHR data ( patient demographics 
and CVH  risk factors)  and upload the most recent  information into the PREVENT 
tool prior to the patient’s clinic visit.   The patient will be randomized to 
intervention or wait -list control.  
PREVENT tool interaction (intervention). The patient will attend a routine clinic 
visit remotely  or in-person at the Late Effects Clinic  at either St. Louis Children’s 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_899034]. Louis Children’ s Specialty Care Center . During this visit,  the 
provider will use PREVENT on a tablet  or computer  (in-person or via a 
teleconference call) to discuss risk, and deliver a tailored behavior change plan 
inclusive of patient -centered community resources.  The P REVENT tool will be 
pre-loaded by [CONTACT_899041] (demographics 
and CVH risk factors)  and show the date in which these data were collected.  The 
provider may update any patient information at the time of the visit. PREVENT  
uses a robust informatics approach developed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Foraker (secondary -
mentor)34-36 to visually display Life’s Simple 7 Cardiovascular Risk Factors ( e.g., 
weight, blood pressure, inactivity)  and calculate the patient’s overall risk for 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_245055] . Physical act ivity and food intake 
recommendations that are tailored to the patient’s current weight status and 
health behaviors using evidence- based recommendations (Trim Kids,37 the 
Stoplight Diet38) proven t o be effective in youth are delivered to the patient . An 
interactive map of community resources near the patient’s home will allow the patient to select resources that will support the recommended behavior change . 
Com munity resources (e.g., parks, fitness and recreation centers, farmer’s 
markets, food pantries) were pulled from YELP  using a n API [CONTACT_99870]. Resources 
were  validated against lists manually generated via online searching of physical 
activity and food departments  and organizations (e.g., the department of parks, 
recreation and forestry) and google. A final action plan (behavior change 
prescription, community resources and education) will be provided to the patient 
at the visit and/or  electronically  via email  or text -message . Patient follow -up will 
be supported by [CONTACT_899042] -message check -ins at 4, 8 and 12 
weeks.  Within the 4 -, 8- and 12-  week email /text message  check -ins the patient 
will be asked to answer questions about meeting their physical activi ty and 
nutrition goals. Based on the response, the patient will receive an automated 
email  and/or text message  with an updated prescription.  
Wait -list control.  Patients will attend a routine care visit  in-person or remotely . A 
PREVENT  action plan ( behavior  change prescription, community resources and 
education) will provided to the patient via email after the completion of follow -up 
measurement.  
Follow -up measurement . Immediately following the clinic visit (within 48 
hours) all patients will be sent electr onically a brief 10 -question (yes/no) 
survey regarding their clinical interaction. Participants randomized to 
intervention will also receive questions about their satisfaction with the

PREVENT tool.  Three months after  the patient’s clinic visit, they  will be sent the 
Health Behavior & Attitudes Survey electronically and an accelerometer via mail. 
Only patients  who presented with abnormal values for CVH risk factors  will return 
to the Late Effects Clinic  to complete a routine clinic visit in accordance  with the 
standard of care for these high -risk patients. Study staff will extract the most -
recent EHR data for CVH risk factors for all patients.  
Qualitative data collection. Semi -structured interviews  will be completed within 
one month of the completion of follow -up measurement for  all participants  that 
received the PREVENT tool .  
4.3.2 Provider Schedule of Events  
 
We anticipate that providers study participation will be approximately 11 months 
in duration. All providers at T he Late Effects  Clinic will be invited to view  an 
online training on how to use the PREVENT tool prior to the start of patient 
recruitment.  The online training will be recorded and disseminated to ensure that 
all providers are able to view the training.  At this time, providers will be supplied 
login credentials to access the PREVENT tool. Following the training, all 
providers will be asked to complete the Clinical Sustainability Assessment Tool 
electronically . Once the intervention period begins, study staff will notify the 
provider if their patient was randomized to intervention to ensure that PREVENT 
is used during the care visit.  Tablets wi ll be available at the clinic if p roviders 
choose to use them to administer the PREVENT tool. However, the PREVENT 
tool can be administered via any computer or tablet using their login credentials . 
A subset of patient -provider interactions (n=15) may be observed and recorded 
while PREVENT is being used.  Providers who used PREVENT will be asked to 
complete an electronic follow -up survey. Within one month of completing the 
intervention, providers will participate in in- depth interviews.  Interviews will be 
held in-person, over the phone or using zoom technology.

4.4 Data Collection Methods  
Theoretical underpi[INVESTIGATOR_11423].  This feasibility study will apply principles of 
Designing for Dissemination, Implementation and Sustainability (D4DIS) to 
understand factors critical to external validity and refine the existing PREVENT tool to fit well with provider’s and patient’s needs, assets and timeframes.
39 We 
seek  to speed translation of the PREVENT tool  into practice by [CONTACT_899043], guided by [CONTACT_899044], Efficacy, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenanc e (RE -AIM) framework.
40,41 The 
updated RE -AIM framework will be used to identify barriers to implementation 
and dissemination as outlined in Table 3.

4.4.1 EHR data  extraction.  Patient demographics (e.g., sex, date of birth, 
race/ethnicity) and the most recent risk factors for CVH (height, weight, fasting 
blood glucose, total cholesterol, blood pressure, smoking status) will be extracted 
at baseline (prior to clinic visit) and at follow -up (3- months). Available EHR d ata 
will be uploaded into PREVENT prior to the clinic visit but may be updated within the PREVENT tool at the time of the clinic visit if updated values are attained. 
CVH risk factor data within the tool at the time of the clinic will be used as 
baseline values and used to determine changes from baseline to follow -up. Only 
patients with abnormal baseline values will return for a follow -up clinic visit at [ADDRESS_1260262]  updated

information for CVH risk factors  (BMI, fasting blood glucose, total cholesterol and 
blood pressure) from baseline) . This feasibility study is intended to determine 
what data are commonly available for a future study. We expect that height and 
weight will be  the most commonly available data point  at baseline and 3 -months. 
Therefore, b ody mass index (BMI) is our primary health outcome and will be 
calculated based on CDC growth charts using height and weight.

demographics  (e.g. annual household income, education- levels, family’s medical 
history) from parents of study participants (n=50) at baseline. The survey will be 
sent electronically using REDCap to give the parent the option of completing the 
survey prior to the clinic visit. Alternatively, the parent may complete the 
questionnaire while in the waiting room at the clinic.  
4.4.3. Health Behavior & Attitudes Survey  will be used to collect phys ical 
activity and nutrition behaviors and attitudes from adolescent patients (n=50) at 
baseline and follow -up. This information will be used to populate the PREVENT 
tool’s risk profile and determine changes in physical activity and nutrition 
behaviors and attitudes from baseline to post -intervention.  The physical activity 
questions are adapted from the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) that has been validated for use in adolescents.
42,[ADDRESS_1260264] behavior 
change questions were adapted from two validated surveys: 1) 45-47the Treatment 
Self-Regulation Scale 48,49 and 2) the Rapid Eating Assessment for Participants - 
Shortened Version.44 
4.4.4 Accelerometers will be administered to patients at baseline and 6- month 
follow -up to objectively measure  levels of physical activity (light, moderate, 
vigorous) and sedentary behaviors. At baseline, a ccelerometers will be mailed to 
participants  after consent is obtained and returned by [CONTACT_107601] a provided pre -
paid envelop or at the clinic visit. The following materials will be sent via mail with 
the accelerometer device: a pre -paid return envelope, a welcome letter, and 
directions for use. Participants randomized to the intervention group will also 
receive a document detailing  “what to expect” at their clinic visit. At follow -up, 
accelerometers will be mailed including a pre- paid return envelope. Participants 
will be asked to wear the device for 7 days including 2 weekend days on a belt 
(provided) around their waist. Participants will be instructed to remove the device 
only when bathing or swimming; they will continue to wear the device while 
sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007].  
4.4.5 Patient and parent qualitative interviews will examine facilitators and 
barriers to maintenance. Semi -structured interviews will be conducted individually 
with patients (n=10) and parents (n=10) . Questions will assess satisfaction with 
their provider interaction, the PREVENT tool’s design, physical activity and nutrition prescriptions, community resources ( e.g., are there other resources that 
would be helpful, did these resources help you or your child achieve the goals)

and, more generally, other ways the clinic may help them achieve behavior 
change.  
4.4.6 Provider survey  will be conducted following the intervention to evaluate 
adoption and understand potential for maintenance.  All providers will complete a 
web-based survey  adapted from five  previous instruments. The acceptability, 
appropriateness, and feasibility of the PREVENT tool will be assessed using the 
Acceptability of Intervention Measure (AIM), Intervention Appropriateness 
Measure (IAM), and Feasibility of Intervention Measure (FIM) .44 Questions 
regarding  the provider’s satisfaction with five aspects of health information 
technology: content, accuracy, format, ease of use and timeliness are adapted 
from [CONTACT_899052]’s (Co -I) previous research.34 Question to assess providers intent 
to change their behavior and continue using PREVENT (maintenance) were adapted from Legare’s CPD Reaction Questionnaire.
50-[ADDRESS_1260265] observation,  audio recordings of 15 patient -provider interactions  
will generate the following implementation outcomes: the delivery of the 
PREVENT tool ( e.g., who is delivering the tool, how the provider delivers the 
information), whether it was delivered as intended (fidelity) and compatibility with 
clinic workflow. Additionally, observation will provide inform ation on how the 
patient interacts with the tool. An observation form will be used by [CONTACT_899045]. Audio recording will occur only while PREVENT is being used and will be assessed by [CONTACT_899046] -provider interaction and clinical decision- making.  
4.4.8 Patient follow -up surveys  will be sent electronically at 4- , 8- and 12 -
weeks to assess whether patient’s are obtaining their physical activity and food 
intake goal s and provide tailored feedback (e.g., updated goals and motivation).  
4.4.9 Provider qualitative interviews  will be conducted following the 4 -month 
period to understand potential for maintenance . Thirty -minute interviews will be 
performed with a diverse group of 5- 10 providers ( e.g., physicians, physician 
assistants, nurses,  clinic staff) at the clinic, by [CONTACT_899047] . 
Interviews will be used to gain in- depth insight on what providers liked about the 
PREVENT tool, whe ther PREVENT is consistent with their and their clinic’s 
priorities/values, and barriers and enabling factors for sustaining PREVENT in their clinic.  
4.4.10 Clinical Sustainability Assessment Tool (CSAT)  will be administered to 
all provider s at the Late Effects C linic following the intervention. CSAT will be 
administered to determine clinic -level readiness and capacity for sustainability of 
the PREVENT tool.
53 Clinic -level factors include organization, financial, 
regulatory and political barriers.

5.2. Data Analysis Plan  
Statistical analysis will be performed using SAS v9.4 (quantitativ e data) and NVivo12 
software (qualitative data).  
For our Aim 1 hypothesis, analyses will be largely descriptive (using means , medians 
and frequencies)  for adoption, implementation and maintenance outcomes using survey 
and observation data. Aim 1 will also be tested using qualitative data. In-depth interview 
and observation data will be professionally transcribed, anonymized, and imported into 
NVivo10 software for thematic analysis. The following steps will be performed for in-
depth interview s and observation data. Guides will be developed and pi[INVESTIGATOR_31219]. Coders 
(n=2) will read over all transcripts and develop a draft of the coding tool. We will practice coding at least three transcripts together to make sure all concepts are adequately captured in the tool. Once the tool is finalized, coders will be assigned transcripts for 
coding, ensuring each one will be coded by [CONTACT_899048]. We will summarize codes into general themes and highlight main  findings with quotes.  
Our Aim 2 hypothesis will be tested using EHR data, accelerometry and patient survey 
data. Accelerometry data will be processed and analyzed using Actigraph software and 
SAS v9.4 using protocols validated in adolescents. The participants’ demographics and 
anthropometrics will be summarized using mean and standard deviation by [CONTACT_98540]. The differences of factors of interest (physical activity, dietary intake, and CVH 
risk factors) between the 2 study groups at baseline will be compared using linear 
regressions. Change from baseline between study groups will be tested using linear 
regressions. Statistical significance will be defined as p<0.05.

Study Schema:  
 
 
Patients with p rogressive disease after two cycles ( defined as a clear increase in bone marrow blast count, typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] a 
> 50% increase in bone marrow blasts over baseline ) should be removed from study . 
Patients with stable disease may conti nue on study and should undergo a diagnostic bone marrow biopsy at the end 
of even numbered cycles.  
Once AML patients achieve morphologic complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi) or MDS 
patients achieve a marrow complete response (Marrow CR) as defined in Section 9 .0, decitabine  
administration may be decreased to 20 mg/m2/day for ten consecutive days every 6 weeks, to limit 
myelosuppressive toxicity  and improve count recovery . After 2 cycles at 6 week intervals, the dose may be 
reduce to 20 mg/m2/day for five consecutive days  in 6 week cycles, at the discretion of the treating phys ician.  
After two cycles of five consecutive days of treatment, if the patient meets the definition of CR with complete 
cytogenetic response as defined in Section 9 .0, administration may further be decrea sed to three  consecutive 
days per cycle  at the discretion of the  treating physician.  
Sample collection for correlative studies:  
Bone marrow biopsies should be performed at baseline , at Cycle 1 Day 10 ± 1 , and at Day 28  ± 4 of Cycles 
1, 2, 4, and 6 . Followi ng Cycle 6, bone marrow biopsies should be performed at the discretion of the 
treating physician to assess for relapse or progression.

Amendment 7 Version date: 11/15/2016   Page 7 of 52 1.0 INTRODUCTIO N 
 
1.1 Rational e   
 
Personalized therapy for cancer requires that 1) patient -specific factors (e.g. patient -
specific mutations, expression profiles, or pharmacogenomics) influence treatment 
algorithms, and 2) once therapy is initiated, in vivo  responsiveness is used to guide further 
therapy. The modern era of genomics has provided significant insights into cancer 
pathogenesis by [CONTACT_295778], as well as defining 
disease -specific patterns of gene expression. However, the application and i ntegration of 
this data with therapeutics remains a difficult task.  
 
Decitabine is a commonly used single -agent therapy for patients with acute myeloid 
leukemia ( AML ) and/or myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ). Historically, it has yielded 
clinical complete res ponses in approximately 25% of patients across diverse clinical trials, 
it is well tolerated, and it can be given as in the outpatient  setting . However, the majority 
of patients do not respond to decitabine, the molecular etiology of decitabine sensitivity  is 
unknown, and there are no algorithms to predict patient responsiveness a priori or even 
within one month of starting therapy.   
 
AML and MDS are two closely related hematological disorder s characterized by 
[CONTACT_295779].  Both AML 
and MDS frequently occur  in elderly patients and some cases are secondary and/or related 
to long -term bone marrow damage after radiation or chemotherapy. Current therapy for 
AML consists of cytotoxic chemotherapy follo wed by [CONTACT_295780]. Using these approaches, current cure rates may be as high as 60% for 
patients younger than 60 with good risk cytogenetics (e.g. t(15;17 ), t(8;21), inv(16)) .[4]  
Outcomes in patients ≥ 60 years old and with relapsed disease remain poor with 2 year 
survival  of only ~25%. [5] Historically, t he available treatment for MDS has been 
symptomatic and has not been shown to be effecti ve in producing sustained improvement 
in hematopoiesis or in delaying leukemic evolution [6, 7] .  
 
Current  AML therapy is poorly tolerated in elderly and pre -treated patients due to  
hematologic and non -hematologic toxicities; following such therapy, patients typi[INVESTIGATOR_295732] 3 -4 weeks of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_295733] . Even among the relatively healthy patients enrolled in clinical t rials, induction 
mortality in the elderly can be as high as 20 -40% following standard induction therapy ,[8-
11] and moderate to severe non -hematolog ic toxicity occurs in at least an additional 30% 
of patients. [9, 12 -14] Consequently, many older AML patients are not offered traditional 
intensive chemotherapy, but receive supportive care alone. [15]  More effective and less 
toxic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_295734] a significant proportion of 
elder ly AML in population s. 
 
Decitabine has been studied in  MDS patients and in  elderly  and/or relapsed  AML patients . 
It has been found to be reasonably well tolerated, can be given in the  outpat ient setting , 
and has overall response rates of 20 -45%.[2, 3, 16 -20] Our own experience has been of 
Genomic Predictors of Decitabine Response in AML/MDS  
 
Amendment 7 Version date: 11/15/2016   Page 8 of 52 CR/PR rates of 25% , [2] and this is typi[INVESTIGATOR_295735] (reviewed in [21]  Decitabine is an S -phase depended drug.  [22 -24] However,  
decitabine is usually administered  in one hour daily infusions  during 3  to 5 consecutive 
days (too short to expose decitabine to most AM L blasts  during at least 2 cycles of 
replication , which divide every 2  to 7 days). [25-27]  Recent experience with increasing the 
number of infusion s per cycle from 5 consecutive da ys to 10 consecutive days has 
improved overall response rates to 67%. [3] Response to decitabine can be slow, sometimes 
requiring 3  to 5 cycles before maximum response is observed. [2] As a consequence, many 
patients are exposed to prolonged therapy, gaining little benefit, before determining 
resistance. There are currently no biomarkers that predict respon se to decitabine.  
 
Decitabine is a cytosine analogue that cannot be methylated. Incorporation of decitabine 
into DNA prevents DNA methylation at cytosine residues and derepresses epi[INVESTIGATOR_295736]. Therefore, the reduction in total ge nomic DNA methylcytosine 
content acts as a marker of effective decitabine dosing. Indeed, two groups have recently 
correlated effective methylcytosine reduction and gene expression derepression to 
response  (Figure 1.1) .[3, 28] 
 
  
   
Figure 1.1. From Shen et al JCO (2010) 28:611 and Blum et al JCO (2007) 25: [ADDRESS_360496] recently  used whole genome sequencing to identify  recurrent, somatic 
mutations in AML and MDS patients in four genes that are involved in methylcytosine 
regulation: DNMT3A, IDH1, IDH2, and TET2. [29-37] Collectively, nearly half of all 
AML/MDS patients have a mutation in one of these four genes.  DNMT3A mutations are 
associated with an adverse outcome in AML patients trea ted with cytotoxic 
chemotherapy. [35, 38] However, it is not yet clear whether the presence of mutations in 
one or more of these genes is associated with response or resistance to decitabine.  
 
In this study, we will treat patients with the current state -of-the-art decitabine schedule. [3] 
We will perform exome sequencing on all patients  and correlate response with mutation 
status, rate of mutat ion clearance , expression profile, plasma  decitabine levels , and DNA

Amendment 7 Version date: 11/15/[ADDRESS_360497] share d mutations in many of the same genes , 
shared patterns of mutation acquisiti on, and shared patterns of mutation evolution .[39, 40] 
Furthermore, MDS, like AML, presents  with clonal hematopoiesis, even when the 
morphologic blast count is zero. [36]Because this study will identify and track the rate of 
clearance of patient specific mutations, and because decitabine has been shown to have 
efficacy in both AML and MDS patients,  [2, 3, 16 -19, 41 -45] combining analys is of AML 
and MDS patients is reasonable.   Asymptomatic MDS patients are excluded because these 
patients are typi[INVESTIGATOR_295737] -waiting rather than with chemotherapy.  
  
1.2 Decitabine  and Hypomethylating agents in AML /MDS  
 
Methylation of cytosine  in the CpG dinucleotide by [CONTACT_295781] a 
significant mechanism for the loss of tumor suppressor gene expression in human cancer, 
including AML  and MDS .[46, 47] Like azacitidine , decitabine  (5-aza-2’-deoxycitidine) is 
incorporated into DNA during S phase and forms covalent adducts with DNA 
methyltransferase. The irreversible inhibition  of this enzyme results in loss of methylation 
and is associated with differentiation. [48]  Decitabine is an appr oximately [ADDRESS_360498] at higher doses  (1-2 µM) .[49]  
 
Decitabine  has been investigated in hematologic malignancies using a range of doses and 
schedules.  It is currently FDA approved for the treatment of adults with MDS at a dose of 
15 mg/m2 every 8 hours for 3 days, based on a Phase III study that demonstrated improve d 
outcomes in the treatment arm compared to patients treated with supportive care alone. [15]  
However, the overall response rate  in this trial w as modest ( 17%). Of note, 18% of the 
patients in th is trial had 20 -30% bone marrow blasts, meeting the current WHO criteria for 
AML.  Subsequent p hase I and II s tudies in AML, using a variety of low -dose decitabine 
regimens, have reporte d overall response rates of 22 -49%.[2, 3, 16 -19, 41 -45] Comparisons 
of multiple low dose schedules have no ted improved efficacy in the MDS population using 
a dose of 20 mg/m2 on Days 1 -5 of a 28 -day cycle. [50, 51 ] Because of these results, we 
have recently explored this dosing schedule in the treatment of elderly patients with 
AML. [52] In this study, we observe d an overall response rate of 24 %, and an additional  
44% of patients achiev ed stable disease during a median of 5 monthly cycles. [48] In this 
study, we noted that decitabine  does not act quickly and the median time to response was 
3 months. These results are similar to the recently published experience in [LOCATION_013] 
treating 227 patients with 15 mg/m2 over 3 hours TID for 3 days every 6 weeks, which 
resulted in a CR/PR rate of 26%. [16]

Amendment 7 Version date: 11/15/2016   Page 10 of 52 A recent study using a prolonged administration schedule (20 mg/m2 IV over 1 hour  on 
consecutive days 1 -10) showed improved  response (64 % CR/PR) and improved time to 
respond (50% of patients had bone marrow blasts < 5% after 1 cycle of therapy). [3]  These 
results are an improvement over previous experience by [CONTACT_295782], and this experi ence is

In general, decitabine  is well tolerated. Unlike conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy, 
decitabine  can be administered in the outpatient setting. However, AML  and MDS are  
aggressive hematologic malignanc ies. Cy topenias commonly result from AML /MDS  
inhibition of normal hematopoiesis , and often do not resolve until a complete response is 
achieved. Thus, neutropenic sepsis and thrombocytopenic bleeding remain significant  
problems regardless  of therapy, especially during the first 4 -8 weeks. In our experience 
treating elderly AML patients, neutropenia occurred in 24%, sepsis in 9% , and bacteremia 
in 7%.  Similar results have been observed in MDS patients. [20, 53, 54 ] As a result, death 
is not uncommon in the first 8 weeks of therapy, occurring in 15 -17% of patients, and most 
commonly resulting from infection  and cytope nias related to disease and the rapy.[16, 52, 
55] While unsettling, these numbers are better than many historical patients  treated with 
cytotoxic chemotherapy , and suggest a need for continued improve ments in therapy .[9, 12]

1.2.1 Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism of Decitabine  
 
In human subjects , after IV administration, decitabine displayed a distribution phase 
with a half -life of 7 minutes and a terminal phase elimination half -life of 10-35 
minutes as measured by [CONTACT_295783]. [56, 57]   The short plasma half -life is d ue to rapid 
inactivation of decitabine by [CONTACT_295784]. [23] Total 
body clearance (Cl p) in humans was high with a mean value of 126 mL/min/kg. [58]  
 
Among five adult patients with advanced solid tumors administered seven courses 
of 100 mg/m2 of decitabine by 1 -hour infusions, [56] maximum plasma 
concentration ranged from [ADDRESS_360502] infusion 
and a slower decline over the next two hours to 6 nM, the level of detectability. 
Plasma half -life (mean SE) was estimated to be appro ximately 7 1 minutes in the 
initial phase (t ½α) and 355 minutes in the second phase (t ½β). The area under the 
plasma concentration -time curve was 408 88 ng.hour/mL for these patients, with a 
peak plasma concentration of 2.01 0.44 µM (0.440.1 µg/mL), while mean volume 
of distribution (Vd ss) and CLp was 4.59 1.42 L/kg and 126 21 mL/min/kg, 
respectively. The time course of DAC concentrations was similar in 1 of 2 patients 
administered 75 mg/m2, while DAC was usually undetectable in the plasma of 
patients  administered 25 to 60 mg/m2. 
 
Using a longer infusion time (up to 40 hours), Rivard et al. [57] reported a plasma 
concentration of 0.1 to 0.4 g/mL. With in fusion times of 40 -60 hours, at an infusion 
rate of 1 mg/kg/h, plasma concentrations of 0.43 -0.76 µg/mL were achieved. [59]  The 
steady -state plasma concentration at an infusion rate of 1  mg/kg/h was estimated to 
be 0.2 -0.5 µg/mL . The half -life after discontinuing the infusion was 12 -20 min.[57]  
 
Urinary excretion of unchanged decitabine was low, ranging from less than 0.01% to 
0.9% of the total dose, and there was no relationship between excretion and dose or 
plasma drug levels. High clearance values and a total urinary excretion of <1% of the

The steady state plasma concentrations (C ss) ranged from 0.31 to 0.39 µg/mL (1.27 
to 1.60 µM) during the infusion of 100 mg/m² decitabine over a 6 -hour period. [61] 
The range of concentrations during a 600 mg/m2 infusion over an 8 -hour period  was 
0.41-16 g/mL (1.68 to 4.76 µM). [60] These plasma concentrations are in the same 
range as the in vitro concentrations that activated the expression of tumor 
suppressor  gene p16 in three human non -small -cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell 
lines. [61]  
 
Steady state decitabine levels of 0.1  to 0.2 µM were achieved in solid tumor patients 
dosed with 30 mg/m²/day and 40 mg/m²/day by [CONTACT_108660] 72 hours. [62]

In our experience  treating primary patient blasts in vitro , concentrations of 100 – 
500 nM are required maximize methylcytosine  reduction without causing cellular 
toxicity. Because decitabine incorporation into DNA is S -phase dependent, 
exposure of cells during cell division is necessary for efficacy.  
  
 
 
 
1.2.2 Experience with  extended dosing schedules  
 
Blum et al recently published their experience treating  elderly AML patients with 
a 10-day course of decitabine 20 mg/m2/day as a 1 -hour infusion .[3] This prolonged 
exposure course was designed to increase the number of AML blast divisions 
exposed to decitabine per cycle. Toxicities were very similar to a  similar regiment 
given as a 3 and 5 day course ,[2, 16]  but the overal l response (CR/PR) was much 
improved (64% vs 25%). In all three  studies, the toxicities were primarily myeloid 
suppression and the resultant infectious and bleeding complications associated with 
leukemic and pharmacologic hematopoietic suppression. Furthermore, Blum et al 
noted that the percent methylcytosine reduction was improved (22% vs 11%) as 

Genomic Predictors of Decitabine Response in AML/MDS  
 
Amendment 7 Version date: 11/15/[ADDRESS_360503] clearance (50% of patients who ultimately achieved a CR had 
≤ 5% bone marrow blasts after 1 cycle vs 0% of patients after 2 cycles). Finally, 
like Shen et al, they obse rved a correlation between the extent of methylcytosine 
reduction and response. [28]  This study suggests that improvement in response 
rates and time to response can be achieved by [CONTACT_295785]. Further, that DNA methylcy tosine reduction can be achieved with 
prolonged exposure to decitabine and that this might be a patient -specific biological 
marker of adequate  dosing.  
  
Scandura et al. recently published a study of infusional decitabine prior to 
cytarabine + daunorubicin induction therapy for AML. [64] They escalated the 
duration of infusional therapy and reached their planned goal of 20 mg/m2/day x 7 
days of continuous therapy given prior to cytarabine and daunorubicin. They noted 
similar toxicities (primarily hematopoietic and the associated neutropenic 
infections) , but that these were not different from their experience giving cytarabine 
+ daunorubicin alone.  
 
1.3 Correlative Studies  
 
All correlative studies will be collected under HRPO# 201011766 (“Tissue Acquisition for 
Analysis of Genetic Progression Factors in Hematologic Diseases ”) that all patients will 
be concurrently enrolled in.  The goals of the correlative studies include:  
 
1. To correlate p atient -specific mutations  with response to decitabine . 
We will perform exome sequencing of each patient’s pre-study  bone marrow sample 
and skin sample. We will determine AML/MDS -associated variants found in the bone 
marrow, but not skin sample. We will correlate the presence of mu tations with response 
(especially mutations in DNMT3A,  IDH1, IDH2, and TET2 ). This study is powered to 
identify mutations with >80% sensitivity to predict decitabine response if used as a 
clinical assay.  
 
2. To correlate the v elocity and depth of response  with response to decitabine . 
We will assess tumor burden by [CONTACT_295786] -specific mutations in bone 
marrow samp les collected pre study , Cycle 1 Day 10±1, Cycle 1 Day 28±4 , and Cycle 
2 Day 28 ±4. We will assess mutations in at least 24 recurrently mutated genes 
(including, but not limited to: FLT3, DNMT3A, NPM1, TET2, WT1, IDH1, IDH2, 
RUNX1, NRAS, TP53, U2AF1, KRAS, PHF6, MSTP9, PTPN11, KIT, SMC3, PRUNE2, 
ETV6, CEBPA, SMC1A, ASXL1, STAG2, RAD21 ) as well as all patient -specific 
mutations discovered during exome sequencing. The leukemic allele frequency will be 
measured using the Illumnia MySeq or HiSeq platform using DNA capture by [CONTACT_295787] -oligonucleotides. Patient bone marrow sa mples will be assessed 
pre-study , Cycle 1 D ay 10 ± 1 , Cycle 1 D ay 28 ± 4 , and Cycle 2 D ay 28 ± 4 and 
compared with patient specific skin samples (normal control). The velocity of response 
will be calculated as the natural log rate of patient -specific mutat ion allele frequency 
clearance. Depth of response will be defined as the lowest patient -specific mutation 
Genomic Predictors of Decitabine Response in AML/MDS  
 
Amendment 7 Version date: 11/15/2016   Page 14 of 52 allele frequency in a bone marrow sample. The velocity and depth of tumor response 
will be correlated to:  
 Achievement of clinical CR,  
 Time to best res ponse,  
 Mutational status,  
 Time to disease progression.  
Because all patient -specific exome -discovered mutations will be assessed a second 
time in the primary bone marrow sample as well as the  Cycle 1 Day 10 ± 1, Cycle 1 
Day 28 ± 4, and Cycle 2 Day 28  ± 4 b one marrow samples, t his study will also serve 
to validate all exome -discovered mutations. This is important, because exome 
sequencing is associated with a 20 -50% false -discovery rate depending on type I error 
tolerated  (mutation -calling algorithms are typ ically set for greater sensitivity than 
specificity) .  Thus, many mutations discovered during exome sequencing are incorrect.  
This second analysis of these mutations will server to exclude these false positive calls.  
 
3. To correlate the bone marrow e xpressi on profile  from pre -study  and Cycle 1 Day 10 ± 
1 with response to decitabine . 
We will correlate expression signatures, and changes in expression signatures, with : 
 Achievement of clinical CR,  
 Mutation status . 
 
4. To correlate the extent of b one marrow DNA hypomethylation  on Cycle 1 Day 10 ± 1 
with response to decitabine . 
We will assess the percent reduction in bone marrow methylcytosine content using LC -
MS. Patients will be evaluated pre-study  and Cycle 1 Day 10 ± 1. The change in DNA 
methylcytosine content  will be correlated to:  
 Achievement of clinical CR,  
 Change in expression signature . 
This will determine whether inadequate blast exposure to decitabine correlates with 
drug resistance.

cytotoxic induction chemotherapy are also excluded , because cytotoxic therapy offers a 
curative possibility for these patients.  MDS patients without cytopenias are also excluded 
because these patients can be followe d with watchful -waiting . 
 
All patients will undergo bone marrow biopsies pre-study,  on Cycle 1  Day 10 ± 1, and on 
Day 28 ± 4 of Cycles 1, 2, 4, and 6 . Following Cycle 6, bone marrow biopsies should be 
performed at the discretion of the treating physician to assess for relapse or progression . 
Patients will provide a skin biopsy sample pre -study.  See Section 8.0 for details  on 
correlative studies .  
 
Patie nts will receive decitabine 20 mg/m2/day as a 1 -hour infusion on consecutive Days 1 -
10 in 28 -day cycles.   The dose will be calculated based on actual patient weight at the 
beginning of each cycle.  
 
Once AML patients achieve morphologic complete remission w ith incomplete blood count 
recovery (CRi)  or MDS patients achieve a marrow complete response (Marrow CR) as 
defined in Section 9 .0, decitabine administration may be decreased to 20 mg/m2/day for 
ten consecutive days every 6 weeks,  to limit myelosuppressive  toxicity  and improve count 
recovery . After 2 cycles at 6 week intervals, the dose may be reduce to 20 mg/m2/day for 
five consecutive days in 6 week cycles, at the discretion of the treating physician.   After 
two cycles of five consecutive days of treatmen t, if the patient meets the definition of CR 
with complete cytogenetic response as defined in Section 9 .0, administration  may further 
be decrease d to three  consecutive days per cycle  at the discretion of the  treating physician .

Amendment 7 Version date: 11/15/2016   Page 25 of 52 6.0 DOSE MODIFICATIONS  
 
A crit erion for discontinuation of the study is a delay of > 8 weeks between any two cycles.  
 
6.1 Delay for Cytopenia or Infection  
 
As cytopenias  are a defining feature of AML and MDS, their presence alone does not 
generally warrant dose modifications or delays. Patients will receive four cycles of therapy 
without adjustment for any cytopenia.  Following Cycle 4, dose modifications or delays for 
cytopenias will be made at the discretion of the investigator .  
 
Patients with febrile neutropenia (temperature ≥ 38.5° with ANC < 1,000/ l) or systemic 
infections should have treatment held until clinical resolution of the infection.  
 
6.2 Delay for Organ Dys function  
 
If ren al dysfunction (creatinine ≥ 3  X institutional upper limit of normal) or hepatic 
dysfunction ( bilirubin ≥ 2.5  mg/dl or ALT/AST ≥ 3 X institutional upper limit of normal)  
occurs, therapy may not resume until the abnormalities have resolved t o below the limits 
stated above. If renal or hepatic dysfunction occurs during  a treatment course, the next dose 
of decitabine should be held, and serum chemistries should be checked twice per week.  
Decitabine can be resumed at full dose when creatinine, bilirubin, ALT and AST are below 
the limits listed above.  
 
For grade 3 -4 non -hematologic toxicities  related to decitabine , decitabine treatment should 
be delayed until recovery to baseline or to grade ≤ 1. Decitabine may be reintroduced with 
a 50% dose re duction, or at full dose at the discretion of the investigator.  
 
6.3 Modification in Dose or Schedule  for Treatment Response  
 
Once AML patients achieve morphologic complete remission with incomplete blood count 
recovery (CRi)  or MDS patients achieve a marrow c omplete response (Marrow CR) as 
defined in Section 9 .0, decitabine administration may be decreased to 20 mg/m2/day for 
ten consecutive days, and the cycles may be administered every 6 weeks  to limit 
myelosuppressive toxicity , at the discretion of the  treating physician. After two cycles at 
six week intervals, the dose may be reduced to 20 mg/m2/day for five consecutive days of 
treatment  in six week intervals . If the patient meets the definition of CR with complete 
cytogenetic response as defined in Sec tion 9 .0, administration  may further be decrease d to 
three  consecutive days per cycle  at the discretion of the  treating physician .

Amendment 7 Version date: 11/15/[ADDRESS_360526] by [CONTACT_295792], a major mechanism for gene expression. In some cancer cells, 
hypermethylation blocks the activity of tumor suppressor genes, which regulate cell 
division and differentiation to prevent malignant transformation. When suppressor gene 
activi ty is blocked, cell division becomes unregulated, leading to the formation of 
neoplastic cells. Decitabine regulates DNA methylation (specifically targets the 
methyltransferase , DNMT1 ), effectively demethylating and reactivating different tumor 
suppressor genes. Because hypermethylation occurs early in the malignant transformation 
of cells, decitabine may have activity in chemoprevention. Other possible mechanisms for 
decitabine activity include cytotoxicity due to incorporation into DNA similar to other 
antimetabolites, methylation -independent induction of gene expression, and degradation of 
DNA methyltransferase 1.

A secondary  endpoint of this study is to estimate morphologic complete remission rate.  
  
9.1 Response Criteria  - AML  
 
AML Patients will be assessed for response according to the IWG criteria:1  
 
Morphologic complete remission  (CR)  – Defined as morphologic leukemia -free state, 
defined as less than 5% blasts in aspi[INVESTIGATOR_295740] a count of ≥200 
nucleated cells and no blasts with Auer rods or any persis tence of extramedullary disease. 
When erythr oid precursors constitute less than 50% of bone marrow nucleated cells, the 
percentage of blasts is based on all nucleated cells; when there are 50% or more erythroid 
cells, the percentage blasts should be based on the nonerythroid cells. The presence of m ild 
megaloblastoid changes may be permitted if they are thought to be consistent with 
treatment effect. However, persistence of pretreatment abnormalities (eg, pseudo -Pelger -
Hüet cells, ringed sideroblasts, dysplastic megakaryocytes) are not consistent wit h CR.   In

14.1 Analysis Populations  
 
Intent -to-Treat  - The intent -to-treat (ITT) population will be defined as all patients wh o 
receive at least one dose of decitabine .  
 
Efficacy -Evaluable  - The efficacy -evaluable (EE) population will be defined as all patients 
who receive at least one cycle of treatment.   
 
Safety  - The safety population will be defined as all pati ents with at least one dose of 
decitabine . 
 
14.2 Statistical Analysis  
 
14.2.1  Descriptiv e Analyses  
 
Patient Disposition : The number of patients discontinued, the reasons for 
discontinuation, and the number of cycles administered will be summarized.  
 
Demographics and Baseline Characteristics : Descriptive summary statistics will 
be provided for  demographic and important baseline characteristics.  For 
continuous variables, the number of patients, mean, standard deviation, median, 
minimum and maximum will be provided.  For categorical variables, the number 
and percent of patients in each demograph ic/characteristic category will be 
summarized.  
 
14.2.2  Primary Endpoint Analysis  
 
The primary end -point of this phase II study is the correlation biomarkers with 
overall response in AML/MDS patients to decitabine.  
 
We will correlate the presence of patient specific mutations  (especially mutations  
in DNMT3A, IDH1, IDH2, and TET2 ) with overall response rates. Mutation rates 
in these genes and in other patient -specific genes will be correlated with overall 
response and t heir respective 95% confidence intervals will be provided.  
 
Statistical considerations. The relationship between AML/MDS -associated 
mutations and the responsiveness to decitabine will be described by [CONTACT_295797] -square test or Fisher’s exact test as appropriate. The 
differentially expressed genes between responders and non -responders will be 
determined using the significance analysis of microarray (SAM). Multivariate 
logistic regression will also be fit to adjust the potential confounding effects of other 
demographic and clinical characteristics. The resultant critical P values will be 
corrected for multiple testing.  Since the Bonferroni correction is known to be too 
conservative, a permutation analysis (e.g., 10,000 random assignments for 
Genomic Predictors of Decitabine Response in AML/MDS  
 
Amendment 7 Version date: 11/15/2016   Page 42 of 52 responsive status) will be u sed to derive an empi[INVESTIGATOR_295745] P value.  The new 
critical p -value is the number of permutation tests which yield a lower p -value than 
the original test divided by [CONTACT_295798]. [61]   
 
A power analysis was performed using Chi -square test for the association between 
mutation and response to decitabine. The frequency of DNMT3A, IDH1/2, and 
TET2 mutations in AML and MDS patients are each between 15% and 30% in 
multiple cohorts. [29-37] Table 3  shows the minimal detectable differences of 
response rates between mutant and wild -type cases, assuming an expected overall 
45% CR/CRi rate and 80% power. For an average of 20% frequency of a mutated 
gene, for example, 100 patients will provide 80% power to detect 30% difference 
at a [ADDRESS_360540] 
30% of clinical response 
could be attributed to the 
presence of a sp ecific 
mutation. However, we 
anticipate that more power 
could be achieved as we 
assess patient groups with 
combined characteristics (e.g. 
DNMT3A mutation or loss of 
DNMT3A expression). In 
addition, we expect that the 
majority of the enrolled 125 
patients c an be used in the analysis (since all of our molecular information will be 
acquired within 30 days of enrollment, we anticipate a drop -out rate of 20% or less).  
 
14.2.3  Secondary Endpoint Analyses  
 
The overall response rate (CR/CRi/PR) and complete response rate (CR/CRi) will 
be compared with historical controls [2], and the 95% confidence intervals will be 
provided.  
 
The rate of patient spe cific mutation clearance after 10, 28, and 56 days of therapy 
will be determined using an Illumina based platform. We will compare the rate of 
mutation clearance between the patients wh o achieve a CR/CRi after 4 cycles and 
those who do not.  We anticipate that we will identify between 6 and 25 exonic 
SNVs per case (the range obtained with >200 AML samples sequenced to date with 
whole genome or exome sequencing), and that the expected 95% confidence 
interval of the mean variant allele frequency will be ±2.56% and ±1.25%, Table 3 . Detectable mutation associated response rates  (80% power, α = 0.05)

same clone. The change of tumor burden over time and its association with clinical 
response will  be assessed using [ADDRESS_360542] ANOVA for repeated measurement data, 
followed by [CONTACT_295799] -hoc multiple comparisons for between -group differences (e.g., 
responders vs. non -responders) at given time points as well as the between -time 
differences within each grou p. The resultant critical P values will also be corrected 
using permutation analysis for multiple testing.  
 
The percent decrease in bone marrow  methylcytosine will be calculated on day 
10±1. We will compare this reduction with previously published data and between 
the patients who achieve CR/CRi and those who do not.  The correlation of peak 
plasma  levels of decitabine with response will be assessed using [ADDRESS_360543] ANOVA 
for repeated measurement data, followed b y the ad -hoc multiple comparisons for 
between -group differences (e.g., responders vs. non -responders) and between -time 
differences. Similar analyses will be performed for the correlation of expression 
profiles and SNP analysis with pharmacokinetic data.   
 
Statistical power justification.   A power analysis was performed using two -sample 
t-test for between -group difference and paired t -test for the change over time. For 
tumor clearance, this will provide > 99% power to detect a 10% difference in the 
means at  two separate time points for clones with 6 or more variants, and > 98% 
power to detect a 15% difference if there are 3 or more variants per clone with α = 
0.05 (power will decrease to 91% and 82%, respectively, in cases where the 
standard deviation is 4.7 %, the maximum we have observe d thus far). For 
pharmacologic correlations, we anticipate 85% power to determine a 25 ng/ml 
difference between the average C max of 45 evaluable responders and 55 evaluable 
non-responders with an anticipated average C max of 70  ng/ml and a standard 
deviation of 40 ng/ml within the entire cohort, and with α = 0.05. [22] We believe a 
less significant difference would n ot be sufficient to warrant application in clinical 
decision making (i.e. whether to continue therapy for more than 1 cycle). We 
anticipate 99% power to determine a difference of 20% in the reduction of bone 
marrow methylcytosine between [ADDRESS_360544] deviation of 15% and α = 0.05. [28, 66-68] 
The difference in methylcytosine reduction previously observed was 30% between 
patients achieving CR/PR and those  with only hematologic improvement. [28]  
 
Time to relapse and time to death will also be listed for each patient.

Study Schema:  
 
 
Patients with p rogressive disease after two cycles ( defined as a clear increase in bone marrow blast count, typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] a 
> 50% increase in bone marrow blasts over baseline ) should be removed from study . 
Patients with stable disease may conti nue on study and should undergo a diagnostic bone marrow biopsy at the end 
of even numbered cycles.  
Once AML patients achieve morphologic complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi) or MDS 
patients achieve a marrow complete response (Marrow CR) as defined in Section 9 .0, decitabine  
administration may be decreased to 20 mg/m2/day for ten consecutive days every 6 weeks, to limit 
myelosuppressive toxicity  and improve count recovery . After 2 cycles at 6 week intervals, the dose may be 
reduce to 20 mg/m2/day for five consecutive days  in 6 week cycles, at the discretion of the treating phys ician.  
After two cycles of five consecutive days of treatment, if the patient meets the definition of CR with complete 
cytogenetic response as defined in Section 9 .0, administration may further be decrea sed to three  consecutive 
days per cycle  at the discretion of the  treating physician.  
Sample collection for correlative studies:  
Bone marrow biopsies should be performed at baseline , at Cycle 1 Day 10 ± 1 , and at Day 28  ± 4 of Cycles 
1, 2, 4, and 6 . Followi ng Cycle 6, bone marrow biopsies should be performed at the discretion of the 
treating physician to assess for relapse or progression.

Genomic Predictors of Decitabine Response in AML/MDS  
 
Amendment 6 Version date: 07/21/2016   Page 7 of 52 1.0 INTRODUCTIO N 
 
1.1 Rational e   
 
Personalized therapy for cancer requires that 1) patient -specific factors (e.g. patient -
specific mutations, expression profiles, or pharmacogenomics) influence treatment 
algorithms, and 2) once therapy is initiated, in vivo  responsiveness is used to guide further 
therapy. The modern era of genomics has provided significant insights into cancer 
pathogenesis by [CONTACT_295778], as well as defining 
disease -specific patterns of gene expression. However, the application and i ntegration of 
this data with therapeutics remains a difficult task.  
 
Decitabine is a commonly used single -agent therapy for patients with acute myeloid 
leukemia ( AML ) and/or myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ). Historically, it has yielded 
clinical complete res ponses in approximately 25% of patients across diverse clinical trials, 
it is well tolerated, and it can be given as in the outpatient  setting . However, the majority 
of patients do not respond to decitabine, the molecular etiology of decitabine sensitivity  is 
unknown, and there are no algorithms to predict patient responsiveness a priori or even 
within one month of starting therapy.   
 
AML and MDS are two closely related hematological disorder s characterized by 
[CONTACT_295779].  Both AML 
and MDS frequently occur  in elderly patients and some cases are secondary and/or related 
to long -term bone marrow damage after radiation or chemotherapy. Current therapy for 
AML consists of cytotoxic chemotherapy follo wed by [CONTACT_295780]. Using these approaches, current cure rates may be as high as 60% for 
patients younger than 60 with good risk cytogenetics (e.g. t(15;17 ), t(8;21), inv(16)) .[4]  
Outcomes in patients ≥ 60 years old and with relapsed disease remain poor with 2 year 
survival  of only ~25%. [5] Historically, t he available treatment for MDS has been 
symptomatic and has not been shown to be effecti ve in producing sustained improvement 
in hematopoiesis or in delaying leukemic evolution [6, 7] .  
 
Current  AML therapy is poorly tolerated in elderly and pre -treated patients due to  
hematologic and non -hematologic toxicities; following such therapy, patients typi[INVESTIGATOR_295732] 3 -4 weeks of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_295733] . Even among the relatively healthy patients enrolled in clinical t rials, induction 
mortality in the elderly can be as high as 20 -40% following standard induction therapy ,[8-
11] and moderate to severe non -hematolog ic toxicity occurs in at least an additional 30% 
of patients. [9, 12 -14] Consequently, many older AML patients are not offered traditional 
intensive chemotherapy, but receive supportive care alone. [15]  More effective and less 
toxic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_295734] a significant proportion of 
elder ly AML in population s. 
 
Decitabine has been studied in  MDS patients and in  elderly  and/or relapsed  AML patients . 
It has been found to be reasonably well tolerated, can be given in the  outpat ient setting , 
and has overall response rates of 20 -45%.[2, 3, 16 -20] Our own experience has been of 
Genomic Predictors of Decitabine Response in AML/MDS  
 
Amendment 6 Version date: 07/21/2016   Page 8 of 52 CR/PR rates of 25% , [2] and this is typi[INVESTIGATOR_295735] (reviewed in [21]  Decitabine is an S -phase depended drug.  [22 -24] However,  
decitabine is usually administered  in one hour daily infusions  during 3  to 5 consecutive 
days (too short to expose decitabine to most AM L blasts  during at least 2 cycles of 
replication , which divide every 2  to 7 days). [25-27]  Recent experience with increasing the 
number of infusion s per cycle from 5 consecutive da ys to 10 consecutive days has 
improved overall response rates to 67%. [3] Response to decitabine can be slow, sometimes 
requiring 3  to 5 cycles before maximum response is observed. [2] As a consequence, many 
patients are exposed to prolonged therapy, gaining little benefit, before determining 
resistance. There are currently no biomarkers that predict respon se to decitabine.  
 
Decitabine is a cytosine analogue that cannot be methylated. Incorporation of decitabine 
into DNA prevents DNA methylation at cytosine residues and derepresses epi[INVESTIGATOR_295736]. Therefore, the reduction in total ge nomic DNA methylcytosine 
content acts as a marker of effective decitabine dosing. Indeed, two groups have recently 
correlated effective methylcytosine reduction and gene expression derepression to 
response  (Figure 1.1) .[3, 28] 
 
  
   
Figure 1.1. From Shen et al JCO (2010) 28:611 and Blum et al JCO (2007) 25: [ADDRESS_360571] recently  used whole genome sequencing to identify  recurrent, somatic 
mutations in AML and MDS patients in four genes that are involved in methylcytosine 
regulation: DNMT3A, IDH1, IDH2, and TET2. [29-37] Collectively, nearly half of all 
AML/MDS patients have a mutation in one of these four genes.  DNMT3A mutations are 
associated with an adverse outcome in AML patients trea ted with cytotoxic 
chemotherapy. [35, 38] However, it is not yet clear whether the presence of mutations in 
one or more of these genes is associated with response or resistance to decitabine.  
 
In this study, we will treat patients with the current state -of-the-art decitabine schedule. [3] 
We will perform exome sequencing on all patients  and correlate response with mutation 
status, rate of mutat ion clearance , expression profile, plasma  decitabine levels , and DNA

Amendment 6 Version date: 07/21/[ADDRESS_360572] share d mutations in many of the same genes , 
shared patterns of mutation acquisiti on, and shared patterns of mutation evolution .[39, 40] 
Furthermore, MDS, like AML, presents  with clonal hematopoiesis, even when the 
morphologic blast count is zero. [36]Because this study will identify and track the rate of 
clearance of patient specific mutations, and because decitabine has been shown to have 
efficacy in both AML and MDS patients,  [2, 3, 16 -19, 41 -45] combining analys is of AML 
and MDS patients is reasonable.   Asymptomatic MDS patients are excluded because these 
patients are typi[INVESTIGATOR_295737] -waiting rather than with chemotherapy.  
  
1.2 Decitabine  and Hypomethylating agents in AML /MDS  
 
Methylation of cytosine  in the CpG dinucleotide by [CONTACT_295781] a 
significant mechanism for the loss of tumor suppressor gene expression in human cancer, 
including AML  and MDS .[46, 47] Like azacitidine , decitabine  (5-aza-2’-deoxycitidine) is 
incorporated into DNA during S phase and forms covalent adducts with DNA 
methyltransferase. The irreversible inhibition  of this enzyme results in loss of methylation 
and is associated with differentiation. [48]  Decitabine is an appr oximately [ADDRESS_360573] at higher doses  (1-2 µM) .[49]  
 
Decitabine  has been investigated in hematologic malignancies using a range of doses and 
schedules.  It is currently FDA approved for the treatment of adults with MDS at a dose of 
15 mg/m2 every 8 hours for 3 days, based on a Phase III study that demonstrated improve d 
outcomes in the treatment arm compared to patients treated with supportive care alone. [15]  
However, the overall response rate  in this trial w as modest ( 17%). Of note, 18% of the 
patients in th is trial had 20 -30% bone marrow blasts, meeting the current WHO criteria for 
AML.  Subsequent p hase I and II s tudies in AML, using a variety of low -dose decitabine 
regimens, have reporte d overall response rates of 22 -49%.[2, 3, 16 -19, 41 -45] Comparisons 
of multiple low dose schedules have no ted improved efficacy in the MDS population using 
a dose of 20 mg/m2 on Days 1 -5 of a 28 -day cycle. [50, 51 ] Because of these results, we 
have recently explored this dosing schedule in the treatment of elderly patients with 
AML. [52] In this study, we observe d an overall response rate of 24 %, and an additional  
44% of patients achiev ed stable disease during a median of 5 monthly cycles. [48] In this 
study, we noted that decitabine  does not act quickly and the median time to response was 
3 months. These results are similar to the recently published experience in [LOCATION_013] 
treating 227 patients with 15 mg/m2 over 3 hours TID for 3 days every 6 weeks, which 
resulted in a CR/PR rate of 26%. [16]

Amendment 6 Version date: 07/21/2016   Page 10 of 52 A recent study using a prolonged administration schedule (20 mg/m2 IV over 1 hour  on 
consecutive days 1 -10) showed improved  response (64 % CR/PR) and improved time to 
respond (50% of patients had bone marrow blasts < 5% after 1 cycle of therapy). [3]  These 
results are an improvement over previous experience by [CONTACT_295782], and this experi ence is

In general, decitabine  is well tolerated. Unlike conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy, 
decitabine  can be administered in the outpatient setting. However, AML  and MDS are  
aggressive hematologic malignanc ies. Cy topenias commonly result from AML /MDS  
inhibition of normal hematopoiesis , and often do not resolve until a complete response is 
achieved. Thus, neutropenic sepsis and thrombocytopenic bleeding remain significant  
problems regardless  of therapy, especially during the first 4 -8 weeks. In our experience 
treating elderly AML patients, neutropenia occurred in 24%, sepsis in 9% , and bacteremia 
in 7%.  Similar results have been observed in MDS patients. [20, 53, 54 ] As a result, death 
is not uncommon in the first 8 weeks of therapy, occurring in 15 -17% of patients, and most 
commonly resulting from infection  and cytope nias related to disease and the rapy.[16, 52, 
55] While unsettling, these numbers are better than many historical patients  treated with 
cytotoxic chemotherapy , and suggest a need for continued improve ments in therapy .[9, 12]

1.2.1 Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism of Decitabine  
 
In human subjects , after IV administration, decitabine displayed a distribution phase 
with a half -life of 7 minutes and a terminal phase elimination half -life of 10-35 
minutes as measured by [CONTACT_295783]. [56, 57]   The short plasma half -life is d ue to rapid 
inactivation of decitabine by [CONTACT_295784]. [23] Total 
body clearance (Cl p) in humans was high with a mean value of 126 mL/min/kg. [58]  
 
Among five adult patients with advanced solid tumors administered seven courses 
of 100 mg/m2 of decitabine by 1 -hour infusions, [56] maximum plasma 
concentration ranged from [ADDRESS_360577] infusion 
and a slower decline over the next two hours to 6 nM, the level of detectability. 
Plasma half -life (mean SE) was estimated to be appro ximately 7 1 minutes in the 
initial phase (t ½α) and 355 minutes in the second phase (t ½β). The area under the 
plasma concentration -time curve was 408 88 ng.hour/mL for these patients, with a 
peak plasma concentration of 2.01 0.44 µM (0.440.1 µg/mL), while mean volume 
of distribution (Vd ss) and CLp was 4.59 1.42 L/kg and 126 21 mL/min/kg, 
respectively. The time course of DAC concentrations was similar in 1 of 2 patients 
administered 75 mg/m2, while DAC was usually undetectable in the plasma of 
patients  administered 25 to 60 mg/m2. 
 
Using a longer infusion time (up to 40 hours), Rivard et al. [57] reported a plasma 
concentration of 0.1 to 0.4 g/mL. With in fusion times of 40 -60 hours, at an infusion 
rate of 1 mg/kg/h, plasma concentrations of 0.43 -0.76 µg/mL were achieved. [59]  The 
steady -state plasma concentration at an infusion rate of 1  mg/kg/h was estimated to 
be 0.2 -0.5 µg/mL . The half -life after discontinuing the infusion was 12 -20 min.[57]  
 
Urinary excretion of unchanged decitabine was low, ranging from less than 0.01% to 
0.9% of the total dose, and there was no relationship between excretion and dose or 
plasma drug levels. High clearance values and a total urinary excretion of <1% of the 
administered dose suggest that decitabine is eliminated rapi[INVESTIGATOR_295738], including extrahepatic metabolism. [60] 
 
The steady state plasma concentrations (C ss) ranged from 0.31 to 0.39 µg/mL (1.27 
to 1.60 µM) during the infusion of 100 mg/m² decitabine over a 6 -hour period. [61] 
The range of concentrations during a 600 mg/m2 infusion over an 8 -hour period  was 
0.41-16 g/mL (1.68 to 4.76 µM). [60] These plasma concentrations are in the same 
range as the in vitro concentrations that activated the expression of tumor 
suppressor  gene p16 in three human non -small -cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell 
lines. [61]  
 
Steady state decitabine levels of 0.1  to 0.2 µM were achieved in solid tumor patients 
dosed with 30 mg/m²/day and 40 mg/m²/day by [CONTACT_108660] 72 hours. [62]

In our experience  treating primary patient blasts in vitro , concentrations of 100 – 
500 nM are required maximize methylcytosine  reduction without causing cellular 
toxicity. Because decitabine incorporation into DNA is S -phase dependent, 
exposure of cells during cell division is necessary for efficacy.  
  
 
 
 
1.2.2 Experience with  extended dosing schedules  
 
Blum et al recently published their experience treating  elderly AML patients with 
a 10-day course of decitabine 20 mg/m2/day as a 1 -hour infusion .[3] This prolonged 
exposure course was designed to increase the number of AML blast divisions 
exposed to decitabine per cycle. Toxicities were very similar to a  similar regiment 
given as a 3 and 5 day course ,[2, 16]  but the overal l response (CR/PR) was much 
improved (64% vs 25%). In all three  studies, the toxicities were primarily myeloid 
suppression and the resultant infectious and bleeding complications associated with 
leukemic and pharmacologic hematopoietic suppression. Furthermore, Blum et al 
noted that the percent methylcytosine reduction was improved (22% vs 11%) as 

Genomic Predictors of Decitabine Response in AML/MDS  
 
Amendment 6 Version date: 07/21/[ADDRESS_360578] clearance (50% of patients who ultimately achieved a CR had 
≤ 5% bone marrow blasts after 1 cycle vs 0% of patients after 2 cycles). Finally, 
like Shen et al, they obse rved a correlation between the extent of methylcytosine 
reduction and response. [28]  This study suggests that improvement in response 
rates and time to response can be achieved by [CONTACT_295785]. Further, that DNA methylcy tosine reduction can be achieved with 
prolonged exposure to decitabine and that this might be a patient -specific biological 
marker of adequate  dosing.  
  
Scandura et al. recently published a study of infusional decitabine prior to 
cytarabine + daunorubicin induction therapy for AML. [64] They escalated the 
duration of infusional therapy and reached their planned goal of 20 mg/m2/day x 7 
days of continuous therapy given prior to cytarabine and daunorubicin. They noted 
similar toxicities (primarily hematopoietic and the associated neutropenic 
infections) , but that these were not different from their experience giving cytarabine 
+ daunorubicin alone.  
 
1.3 Correlative Studies  
 
All correlative studies will be collected under HRPO# 201011766 (“Tissue Acquisition for 
Analysis of Genetic Progression Factors in Hematologic Diseases ”) that all patients will 
be concurrently enrolled in.  The goals of the correlative studies include:  
 
1. To correlate p atient -specific mutations  with response to decitabine . 
We will perform exome sequencing of each patient’s pre-study  bone marrow sample 
and skin sample. We will determine AML/MDS -associated variants found in the bone 
marrow, but not skin sample. We will correlate the presence of mu tations with response 
(especially mutations in DNMT3A,  IDH1, IDH2, and TET2 ). This study is powered to 
identify mutations with >80% sensitivity to predict decitabine response if used as a 
clinical assay.  
 
2. To correlate the v elocity and depth of response  with response to decitabine . 
We will assess tumor burden by [CONTACT_295786] -specific mutations in bone 
marrow samp les collected pre study , Cycle 1 Day 10±1, Cycle 1 Day 28±4 , and Cycle 
2 Day 28 ±4. We will assess mutations in at least 24 recurrently mutated genes 
(including, but not limited to: FLT3, DNMT3A, NPM1, TET2, WT1, IDH1, IDH2, 
RUNX1, NRAS, TP53, U2AF1, KRAS, PHF6, MSTP9, PTPN11, KIT, SMC3, PRUNE2, 
ETV6, CEBPA, SMC1A, ASXL1, STAG2, RAD21 ) as well as all patient -specific 
mutations discovered during exome sequencing. The leukemic allele frequency will be 
measured using the Illumnia MySeq or HiSeq platform using DNA capture by [CONTACT_295787] -oligonucleotides. Patient bone marrow sa mples will be assessed 
pre-study , Cycle 1 D ay 10 ± 1 , Cycle 1 D ay 28 ± 4 , and Cycle 2 D ay 28 ± 4 and 
compared with patient specific skin samples (normal control). The velocity of response 
will be calculated as the natural log rate of patient -specific mutat ion allele frequency 
clearance. Depth of response will be defined as the lowest patient -specific mutation 
Genomic Predictors of Decitabine Response in AML/MDS  
 
Amendment 6 Version date: 07/21/2016   Page 14 of 52 allele frequency in a bone marrow sample. The velocity and depth of tumor response 
will be correlated to:  
 Achievement of clinical CR,  
 Time to best res ponse,  
 Mutational status,  
 Time to disease progression.  
Because all patient -specific exome -discovered mutations will be assessed a second 
time in the primary bone marrow sample as well as the  Cycle 1 Day 10 ± 1, Cycle 1 
Day 28 ± 4, and Cycle 2 Day 28  ± 4 b one marrow samples, t his study will also serve 
to validate all exome -discovered mutations. This is important, because exome 
sequencing is associated with a 20 -50% false -discovery rate depending on type I error 
tolerated  (mutation -calling algorithms are typ ically set for greater sensitivity than 
specificity) .  Thus, many mutations discovered during exome sequencing are incorrect.  
This second analysis of these mutations will server to exclude these false positive calls.  
 
3. To correlate the bone marrow e xpressi on profile  from pre -study  and Cycle 1 Day 10 ± 
1 with response to decitabine . 
We will correlate expression signatures, and changes in expression signatures, with : 
 Achievement of clinical CR,  
 Mutation status . 
 
4. To correlate the extent of b one marrow DNA hypomethylation  on Cycle 1 Day 10 ± 1 
with response to decitabine . 
We will assess the percent reduction in bone marrow methylcytosine content using LC -
MS. Patients will be evaluated pre-study  and Cycle 1 Day 10 ± 1. The change in DNA 
methylcytosine content  will be correlated to:  
 Achievement of clinical CR,  
 Change in expression signature . 
This will determine whether inadequate blast exposure to decitabine correlates with 
drug resistance.

2. The bone marrow expression profile and change in expression prof ile during 
decitabine treatment;  
3. The decrease in bone marrow methylcytosine content in response to decitabine.

promyelocytic leukemia. AML patients who a re < [ADDRESS_360590] not received 
cytotoxic induction chemotherapy are also excluded , because cytotoxic therapy offers a 
curative possibility for these patients.  MDS patients without cytopenias are also excluded 
because these patients can be followe d with watchful -waiting . 
 
All patients will undergo bone marrow biopsies pre-study,  on Cycle 1  Day 10 ± 1, and on 
Day 28 ± 4 of Cycles 1, 2, 4, and 6 . Following Cycle 6, bone marrow biopsies should be 
performed at the discretion of the treating physician to assess for relapse or progression . 
Patients will provide a skin biopsy sample pre -study.  See Section 8.0 for details  on 
correlative studies .  
 
Patie nts will receive decitabine 20 mg/m2/day as a 1 -hour infusion on consecutive Days 1 -
10 in 28 -day cycles.   The dose will be calculated based on actual patient weight at the 
beginning of each cycle.  
 
Once AML patients achieve morphologic complete remission w ith incomplete blood count 
recovery (CRi)  or MDS patients achieve a marrow complete response (Marrow CR) as 
defined in Section 9 .0, decitabine administration may be decreased to 20 mg/m2/day for 
ten consecutive days every 6 weeks,  to limit myelosuppressive  toxicity  and improve count 
recovery . After 2 cycles at 6 week intervals, the dose may be reduce to 20 mg/m2/day for 
five consecutive days in 6 week cycles, at the discretion of the treating physician.   After 
two cycles of five consecutive days of treatmen t, if the patient meets the definition of CR 
with complete cytogenetic response as defined in Section 9 .0, administration  may further 
be decrease d to three  consecutive days per cycle  at the discretion of the  treating physician . 
 
It will be a logistical goa l of this trial consistently to return preliminary exome results to 
the treating physician by [CONTACT_42334] 1 and validated results by [CONTACT_42334] 2. 
However, this logistical goal is not a primary or secondary aim of this study. Given the 
limited d ata regarding mutation presence and drug response, we do not anticipate that the 
results will directly influence therapeutic decisions made by [CONTACT_1963].

Amendment 6 Version date: 07/21/2016   Page 25 of 52 6.0 DOSE MODIFICATIONS  
 
A crit erion for discontinuation of the study is a delay of > 8 weeks between any two cycles.  
 
6.1 Delay for Cytopenia or Infection  
 
As cytopenias  are a defining feature of AML and MDS, their presence alone does not 
generally warrant dose modifications or delays. Patients will receive four cycles of therapy 
without adjustment for any cytopenia.  Following Cycle 4, dose modifications or delays for 
cytopenias will be made at the discretion of the investigator .  
 
Patients with febrile neutropenia (temperature ≥ 38.5° with ANC < 1,000/ l) or systemic 
infections should have treatment held until clinical resolution of the infection.  
 
6.2 Delay for Organ Dys function  
 
If ren al dysfunction (creatinine ≥ 3  X institutional upper limit of normal) or hepatic 
dysfunction ( bilirubin ≥ 2.5  mg/dl or ALT/AST ≥ 3 X institutional upper limit of normal)  
occurs, therapy may not resume until the abnormalities have resolved t o below the limits 
stated above. If renal or hepatic dysfunction occurs during  a treatment course, the next dose 
of decitabine should be held, and serum chemistries should be checked twice per week.  
Decitabine can be resumed at full dose when creatinine, bilirubin, ALT and AST are below 
the limits listed above.  
 
For grade 3 -4 non -hematologic toxicities  related to decitabine , decitabine treatment should 
be delayed until recovery to baseline or to grade ≤ 1. Decitabine may be reintroduced with 
a 50% dose re duction, or at full dose at the discretion of the investigator.  
 
6.3 Modification in Dose or Schedule  for Treatment Response  
 
Once AML patients achieve morphologic complete remission with incomplete blood count 
recovery (CRi)  or MDS patients achieve a marrow c omplete response (Marrow CR) as 
defined in Section 9 .0, decitabine administration may be decreased to 20 mg/m2/day for 
ten consecutive days, and the cycles may be administered every 6 weeks  to limit 
myelosuppressive toxicity , at the discretion of the  treating physician. After two cycles at 
six week intervals, the dose may be reduced to 20 mg/m2/day for five consecutive days of 
treatment  in six week intervals . If the patient meets the definition of CR with complete 
cytogenetic response as defined in Sec tion 9 .0, administration  may further be decrease d to 
three  consecutive days per cycle  at the discretion of the  treating physician .

Amendment 6 Version date: 07/21/[ADDRESS_360601] by [CONTACT_295792], a major mechanism for gene expression. In some cancer cells, 
hypermethylation blocks the activity of tumor suppressor genes, which regulate cell 
division and differentiation to prevent malignant transformation. When suppressor gene 
activi ty is blocked, cell division becomes unregulated, leading to the formation of 
neoplastic cells. Decitabine regulates DNA methylation (specifically targets the 
methyltransferase , DNMT1 ), effectively demethylating and reactivating different tumor 
suppressor genes. Because hypermethylation occurs early in the malignant transformation 
of cells, decitabine may have activity in chemoprevention. Other possible mechanisms for 
decitabine activity include cytotoxicity due to incorporation into DNA similar to other 
antimetabolites, methylation -independent induction of gene expression, and degradation of 
DNA methyltransferase 1.

A secondary  endpoint of this study is to estimate morphologic complete remission rate.  
  
9.1 Response Criteria  - AML  
 
AML Patients will be assessed for response according to the IWG criteria:1  
 
Morphologic complete remission  (CR)  – Defined as morphologic leukemia -free state, 
defined as less than 5% blasts in aspi[INVESTIGATOR_295740] a count of ≥200 
nucleated cells and no blasts with Auer rods or any persis tence of extramedullary disease. 
When erythr oid precursors constitute less than 50% of bone marrow nucleated cells, the 
percentage of blasts is based on all nucleated cells; when there are 50% or more erythroid 
cells, the percentage blasts should be based on the nonerythroid cells. The presence of m ild 
megaloblastoid changes may be permitted if they are thought to be consistent with 
treatment effect. However, persistence of pretreatment abnormalities (eg, pseudo -Pelger -
Hüet cells, ringed sideroblasts, dysplastic megakaryocytes) are not consistent wit h CR.   In 
addition, ANC >1000/μl and platelet count of ≥100,000/μl. Patient must be independent of 
transfusions. No duration requirement for this designation.  
 
Cytogenetic complete remission (CCR) – Defined as morphologic complete remission plus 
a reversio n to a normal karyotype. For this study, reversion of a normal karyotype is 
defined as no clonal abnormalities detected in a minimum of 20 mitotic cells.  
 
Morphologic complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery  (CRi)  – Defined as 
morphologic complete recovery with the exception of neutropenia <1000/μl or 
thrombocytopenia <100,000/μl.  
 
Partial remission  (PR) – Defined as meeting the above criteria for complete remission, 
with the following exceptions: decrease of ≥50% in the percentage of blast to 5 -25% in the 
bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337]. A value of 5% blasts in bone marrow with Auer rods present may 
also be considered a partial remission.  
 
Stable Disease (SD) – Defined as not meeting th e definitions of CR, CRi, PR, PD , or 
recurrence/morphologic relapse.   
 
Progressive disease  (PD) – Defined as a clear increase in bone marrow blast count, 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] a greater than 50% increase compared with baseline , or new extramedullary 
disease . Patients with a > 50% increase in peripheral blast count with an increase of the 
total peripheral white blood cell count to > 10,000/ l should undergo evaluation by [CONTACT_295793] .  
 
Recurrence/morphologic relapse  - Defined as relapse following complete remission  is 
defined as reappearance of blasts in the blood or the finding of ≥5% blasts in the bone 
marrow, not attributable to any other cause. New dysplastic changes is considered relapse.

who receive at least one cycle of treatment.   
 
Safety  - The safety population will be defined as all pati ents with at least one dose of 
decitabine . 
 
14.2 Statistical Analysis  
 
14.2.1  Descriptiv e Analyses  
 
Patient Disposition : The number of patients discontinued, the reasons for 
discontinuation, and the number of cycles administered will be summarized.  
 
Demographics and Baseline Characteristics : Descriptive summary statistics will 
be provided for  demographic and important baseline characteristics.  For 
continuous variables, the number of patients, mean, standard deviation, median, 
minimum and maximum will be provided.  For categorical variables, the number 
and percent of patients in each demograph ic/characteristic category will be 
summarized.  
 
14.2.2  Primary Endpoint Analysis  
 
The primary end -point of this phase II study is the correlation biomarkers with 
overall response in AML/MDS patients to decitabine.  
 
We will correlate the presence of patient specific mutations  (especially mutations  
in DNMT3A, IDH1, IDH2, and TET2 ) with overall response rates. Mutation rates 
in these genes and in other patient -specific genes will be correlated with overall 
response and t heir respective 95% confidence intervals will be provided.  
 
Statistical considerations. The relationship between AML/MDS -associated 
mutations and the responsiveness to decitabine will be described by [CONTACT_295797] -square test or Fisher’s exact test as appropriate. The 
differentially expressed genes between responders and non -responders will be 
determined using the significance analysis of microarray (SAM). Multivariate 
logistic regression will also be fit to adjust the potential confounding effects of other 
demographic and clinical characteristics. The resultant critical P values will be 
corrected for multiple testing.  Since the Bonferroni correction is known to be too 
conservative, a permutation analysis (e.g., 10,000 random assignments for 
Genomic Predictors of Decitabine Response in AML/MDS  
 
Amendment 6 Version date: 07/21/2016   Page 42 of 52 responsive status) will be u sed to derive an empi[INVESTIGATOR_295745] P value.  The new 
critical p -value is the number of permutation tests which yield a lower p -value than 
the original test divided by [CONTACT_295798]. [61]   
 
A power analysis was performed using Chi -square test for the association between 
mutation and response to decitabine. The frequency of DNMT3A, IDH1/2, and 
TET2 mutations in AML and MDS patients are each between 15% and 30% in 
multiple cohorts. [29-37] Table 3  shows the minimal detectable differences of 
response rates between mutant and wild -type cases, assuming an expected overall 
45% CR/CRi rate and 80% power. For an average of 20% frequency of a mutated 
gene, for example, 100 patients will provide 80% power to detect 30% difference 
at a [ADDRESS_360615] 
30% of clinical response 
could be attributed to the 
presence of a sp ecific 
mutation. However, we 
anticipate that more power 
could be achieved as we 
assess patient groups with 
combined characteristics (e.g. 
DNMT3A mutation or loss of 
DNMT3A expression). In 
addition, we expect that the 
majority of the enrolled 125 
patients c an be used in the analysis (since all of our molecular information will be 
acquired within 30 days of enrollment, we anticipate a drop -out rate of 20% or less).  
 
14.2.3  Secondary Endpoint Analyses  
 
The overall response rate (CR/CRi/PR) and complete response rate (CR/CRi) will 
be compared with historical controls [2], and the 95% confidence intervals will be 
provided.  
 
The rate of patient spe cific mutation clearance after 10, 28, and 56 days of therapy 
will be determined using an Illumina based platform. We will compare the rate of 
mutation clearance between the patients wh o achieve a CR/CRi after 4 cycles and 
those who do not.  We anticipate that we will identify between 6 and 25 exonic 
SNVs per case (the range obtained with >200 AML samples sequenced to date with 
whole genome or exome sequencing), and that the expected 95% confidence 
interval of the mean variant allele frequency will be ±2.56% and ±1.25%, Table 3 . Detectable mutation associated response rates  (80% power, α = 0.05)

Amendment 6 Version date: 07/21/[ADDRESS_360616] deviation of 3.2% within the 
same clone. The change of tumor burden over time and its association with clinical 
response will  be assessed using [ADDRESS_360617] ANOVA for repeated measurement data, 
followed by [CONTACT_295799] -hoc multiple comparisons for between -group differences (e.g., 
responders vs. non -responders) at given time points as well as the between -time 
differences within each grou p. The resultant critical P values will also be corrected 
using permutation analysis for multiple testing.  
 
The percent decrease in bone marrow  methylcytosine will be calculated on day 
10±1. We will compare this reduction with previously published data and between 
the patients who achieve CR/CRi and those who do not.  The correlation of peak 
plasma  levels of decitabine with response will be assessed using [ADDRESS_360618] ANOVA 
for repeated measurement data, followed b y the ad -hoc multiple comparisons for 
between -group differences (e.g., responders vs. non -responders) and between -time 
differences. Similar analyses will be performed for the correlation of expression 
profiles and SNP analysis with pharmacokinetic data.   
 
Statistical power justification.   A power analysis was performed using two -sample 
t-test for between -group difference and paired t -test for the change over time. For 
tumor clearance, this will provide > 99% power to detect a 10% difference in the 
means at  two separate time points for clones with 6 or more variants, and > 98% 
power to detect a 15% difference if there are 3 or more variants per clone with α = 
0.05 (power will decrease to 91% and 82%, respectively, in cases where the 
standard deviation is 4.7 %, the maximum we have observe d thus far). For 
pharmacologic correlations, we anticipate 85% power to determine a 25 ng/ml 
difference between the average C max of 45 evaluable responders and 55 evaluable 
non-responders with an anticipated average C max of 70  ng/ml and a standard 
deviation of 40 ng/ml within the entire cohort, and with α = 0.05. [22] We believe a 
less significant difference would n ot be sufficient to warrant application in clinical 
decision making (i.e. whether to continue therapy for more than 1 cycle). We 
anticipate 99% power to determine a difference of 20% in the reduction of bone 
marrow methylcytosine between [ADDRESS_360619] deviation of 15% and α = 0.05. [28, 66-68] 
The difference in methylcytosine reduction previously observed was 30% between 
patients achieving CR/PR and those  with only hematologic improvement. [28]  
 
Time to relapse and time to death will also be listed for each patient.

Study Schema:  
 
 
Patients with p rogressive disease after two cycles ( defined as a clear increase in bone marrow blast count, typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] a 
> 50% increase in bone marrow blasts over baseline ) should be removed from study . 
Patients with stable disease may conti nue on study and should undergo a diagnostic bone marrow biopsy at the end 
of even numbered cycles.  
Once AML patients achieve morphologic complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi) or MDS 
patients achieve a marrow complete response (Marrow CR) as defined in Section 9 .0, decitabine 
administration may be decreased to 20 mg/m2/day for ten consecutive days every 6 weeks, to limit

Amendment 5 Version date: 04/21/16   Page 6 of 51 1.0 INTRODUCTIO N 
 
1.1 Rational e   
 
Personalized therapy for cancer requires that 1) patient -specific factors (e.g. patient -
specific mutations, expression profiles, or pharmacogenomics) influence treatment 
algorithms, and 2) once therapy is initiated, in vivo  responsiveness is used to guide further 
therapy. The modern era of genomics has provided significant insights into cancer 
pathogenesis by [CONTACT_295778], as well as defining 
disease -specific patterns of gene expression. However, the application and i ntegration of 
this data with therapeutics remains a difficult task.  
 
Decitabine is a commonly used single -agent therapy for patients with acute myeloid 
leukemia ( AML ) and/or myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ). Historically, it has yielded 
clinical complete res ponses in approximately 25% of patients across diverse clinical trials, 
it is well tolerated, and it can be given as in the outpatient  setting . However, the majority 
of patients do not respond to decitabine, the molecular etiology of decitabine sensitivity  is 
unknown, and there are no algorithms to predict patient responsiveness a priori or even 
within one month of starting therapy.   
 
AML and MDS are two closely related hematological disorder s characterized by 
[CONTACT_295779].  Both AML 
and MDS frequently occur  in elderly patients and some cases are secondary and/or related 
to long -term bone marrow damage after radiation or chemotherapy. Current therapy for 
AML consists of cytotoxic chemotherapy follo wed by [CONTACT_295780]. Using these approaches, current cure rates may be as high as 60% for 
patients younger than 60 with good risk cytogenetics (e.g. t(15;17 ), t(8;21), inv(16)) .[4]  
Outcomes in patients ≥ 60 years old and with relapsed disease remain poor with 2 year 
survival  of only ~25%. [5] Historically, t he available treatment for MDS has been 
symptomatic and has not been shown to be effecti ve in producing sustained improvement 
in hematopoiesis or in delaying leukemic evolution [6, 7] .  
 
Current  AML therapy is poorly tolerated in elderly and pre -treated patients due to  
hematologic and non -hematologic toxicities; following such therapy, patients typi[INVESTIGATOR_295732] 3 -4 weeks of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_295733] . Even among the relatively healthy patients enrolled in clinical t rials, induction 
mortality in the elderly can be as high as 20 -40% following standard induction therapy ,[8-
11] and moderate to severe non -hematologic toxicity occurs in at least an additional 30% 
of patients. [9, 12 -14] Consequently, many older AML patient s are not offered traditional 
intensive chemotherapy, but receive supportive care alone. [15]  More effective and less 
toxic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_295734] a significant proportion of 
elder ly AML in population s. 
 
Decitabine has been studied in  MDS patients and in  elderly  and/or relapsed  AML patients . 
It has been found to be reasonably well tolerated, can be given in the  outpatient  setting , 
and has overall response rates of 20 -45%.[2, 3, 16 -20] Our own experience has been of 
Genomic Predictors of Decitabine Response in AML/MDS  
 
Amendment 5 Version date: 04/21/16   Page 7 of 51 CR/PR rates of 25% , [2] and this is typi[INVESTIGATOR_295735] (reviewed in [21]  Decitabine is an S -phase depended drug.  [22 -24] However, 
decitabine is usually administered  in one hour daily infusions  during 3  to 5 consecutive 
days (too short to expose decitabi ne to most AM L blasts  during at least 2 cycles of 
replication , which divide every 2  to 7 days). [25-27]  Recent experience with increasing the 
number of infusion s per cycle from 5 consecutive da ys to 10 consecutive days has 
improved overall response rates to 67%. [3] Response to decitabine can be slow, sometimes 
requiring 3  to 5 cycles before maximum response is observed. [2] As a consequence, many 
patients are exposed to prolonged therapy, gaining little benefit, before determining 
resistance. There are currently no biomarkers that predict respon se to decitabine.  
 
Decitabine is a cytosine analogue that cannot be methylated. Incorporation of decitabine 
into DNA prevents DNA methylation at cytosine residues and derepresses epi[INVESTIGATOR_295736]. Therefore, the reduction in total ge nomic DNA methylcytosine 
content acts as a marker of effective decitabine dosing. Indeed, two groups have recently 
correlated effective methylcytosine reduction and gene expression derepression to 
response  (Figure 1.1) .[3, 28] 
 
  
   
Figure 1.1. From Shen et al JCO (2010) 28:611 and Blum et al JCO (2007) 25: 3884.  
 
We and others have recently  used whole genome sequencing to identify  recurrent, somatic 
mutations in AML and MDS patients in four genes that are involved in methylcytosine 
regulation: DNMT3A, IDH1, IDH2, and TET2. [29-37] Collectively, nearly half of all 
AML/MDS patients have a mutation in one of these four genes.  DNMT3A mutations are 
associated with an adverse outcome in AML patients trea ted with cytotoxic 
chemotherapy. [35, 38] However, it is not yet clear whether the presence of mutations in 
one or more of these genes is associated with respo nse or resistance to decitabine.  
 
In this study, we will treat patients with the current state -of-the-art decitabine schedule. [3] 
We will perform exome sequencing on all patients and correlate response wi th mutation 
status, rate of mutat ion clearance , expression profile, plasma  decitabine levels , and DNA

Amendment 5 Version date: 04/21/[ADDRESS_360646] share d mutations in many of the same genes , 
shared patterns of mutation acquisition, and shared patterns of  mutation evolution .[39, 40] 
Furthermore, MDS, like AML, presents  with clonal hematopoiesis, even when the 
morphologic blast count is zero. [36]Because this study will  identify and track the rate of 
clearance of patient specific mutations, and because decitabine has been shown to have 
efficacy in both AML and MDS patients,  [2, 3, 16 -19, 41 -45] combining analysis of AML 
and MDS patients is reas onable.   Asymptomatic MDS patients are excluded because these 
patients are typi[INVESTIGATOR_295737] -waiting rather than with chemotherapy.  
  
1.2 Decitabine  and Hypomethylating agents in AML /MDS  
 
Methylation of cytosine in the CpG dinucleotide by [CONTACT_295803] a 
significant mechanism for the loss of tumor suppressor gene expression in human cancer, 
including AML  and MDS .[46, 47] Like azacitidine , decitabine  (5-aza-2’-deoxycitidine) is 
incorporated into DNA during S phase and forms covalent adducts with DNA 
methyltransferase. The irreversible inhibition of this enzyme results in loss of methylation 
and is associated  with differentiation. [48]  Decitabine is an approximately [ADDRESS_360647]  at higher doses  (1-2 µM) .[49]  
 
Decitabine has been investigated in hematologic malignancies using a range of doses and 
schedules.  It is currently FDA approved for the treatment of adults with MDS at a dose of 
15 mg/m2 every 8 hours for 3 days, based on a Phase III study that demonstrated improved 
outcomes in the treatment arm compared to patients treated with supportive care alone. [15]  
However, the overall response rate  in this trial w as modest ( 17%). Of note, 18% of the 
patients in th is trial had 20 -30% bone marrow blasts, meeting the current WHO criteria for 
AML.  Subsequent p hase I and II studies in AML, using a variety of low -dose decitabine 
regimens, have reporte d overall response rates of 22 -49%.[2, 3, 16 -19, 41 -45] Comparisons 
of multiple low dose schedules have noted improved efficacy in the MDS population using 
a dose of 20 mg/m2 on Days 1 -5 of a 28 -day cycle. [50, 51 ] Because of th ese results, we 
have recently explored this dosing schedule in the treatment of elderly patients with 
AML. [52] In this study, we observe d an overall response rate of 24 %, and an additional  
44% of patients achiev ed stable disease during a median of 5 monthly cycles. [48] In this 
study, we noted that decitabine  does not act quickly and the median time to response was 
3 months. These results are similar to the recently published experience in [LOCATION_013] 
treating 227 patients with 15 mg/m2 over 3 hours TID for 3 days every 6 weeks, which 
resulted in a CR/PR rate of 26%. [16]

Amendment 5 Version date: 04/21/16   Page 9 of 51 A recent study using a prolonged administration schedule (20 mg/m2 IV over 1 hour  on 
consecutive days 1 -10) showed improved  response (64 % CR/PR) and improved time to 
respond (50% of patients had bone marrow blasts < 5% after 1 cycle of therapy). [3]  These 
results are an improvement over previous experience by [CONTACT_295782], and this experi ence is

In general, decitabine  is well tolerated. Unlike conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy, 
decitabine  can be administered in the outpatient setting. However, AML  and MDS are  
aggressive hematologic malignanc ies. Cy topenias commonly result from AML /MDS  
inhibition of normal hematopoiesis , and often do not resolve until a complete response is 
achieved. Thus, neutropenic sepsis and thrombocytopenic bleeding remain significant  
problems regardless  of therapy, especially during the first 4 -8 weeks. In our experience 
treating elderly AML patients, neutropenia occurred in 24%, sepsis in 9% , and bacteremia 
in 7%.  Similar results have been observed in MDS patients. [20, 53, 54 ] As a result, death 
is not uncommon in the first 8 weeks of therapy, occurring in 15 -17% of patients, and most 
commonly resulting from infection  and cytope nias related to disease and the rapy.[16, 52, 
55] While unsettling, these numbers are better than many historical patients  treated with 
cytotoxic chemotherapy , and suggest a need for continued improve ments in therapy .[9, 12]

1.2.1 Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism of Decitabine  
 
In human subjects , after IV administration, decitabine displayed a distribution phase 
with a half -life of 7 minutes and a terminal phase elimination half -life of 10-35 
minutes as measured by [CONTACT_295783]. [56, 57]   The short plasma half -life is d ue to rapid 
inactivation of decitabine by [CONTACT_295784]. [23] Total 
body clearance (Cl p) in humans was high with a mean value of 126 mL/min/kg. [58]  
 
Among five adult patients with advanced solid tumors administered seven courses 
of 100 mg/m2 of decitabine by 1 -hour infusions, [56] maximum plasma 
concentration ranged from [ADDRESS_360651] infusion 
and a slower decline over the next two hours to 6 nM, the level of detectability. 
Plasma half -life (mean SE) was estimated to be appro ximately 7 1 minutes in the 
initial phase (t ½α) and 355 minutes in the second phase (t ½β). The area under the 
plasma concentration -time curve was 408 88 ng.hour/mL for these patients, with a 
peak plasma concentration of 2.01 0.44 µM (0.440.1 µg/mL), while mean volume 
of distribution (Vd ss) and CLp was 4.59 1.42 L/kg and 126 21 mL/min/kg, 
respectively. The time course of DAC concentrations was similar in 1 of 2 patients 
administered 75 mg/m2, while DAC was usually undetectable in the plasma of 
patients  administered 25 to 60 mg/m2. 
 
Using a longer infusion time (up to 40 hours), Rivard et al. [57] reported a plasma 
concentration of 0.1 to 0.4 g/mL. With in fusion times of 40 -60 hours, at an infusion 
rate of 1 mg/kg/h, plasma concentrations of 0.43 -0.76 µg/mL were achieved. [59]  The 
steady -state plasma concentration at an infusion rate of 1  mg/kg/h was estimated to 
be 0.2 -0.5 µg/mL . The half -life after discontinuing the infusion was 12 -20 min.[57]  
 
Urinary excretion of unchanged decitabine was low, ranging from less than 0.01% to 
0.9% of the total dose, and there was no relationship between excretion and dose or 
plasma drug levels. High clearance values and a total urinary excretion of <1% of the 
administered dose suggest that decitabine is eliminated rapi[INVESTIGATOR_295738], including extrahepatic metabolism. [60] 
 
The steady state plasma concentrations (C ss) ranged from 0.31 to 0.39 µg/mL (1.27 
to 1.60 µM) during the infusion of 100 mg/m² decitabine over a 6 -hour period. [61] 
The range of concentrations during a 600 mg/m2 infusion over an 8 -hour period  was 
0.41-16 g/mL (1.68 to 4.76 µM). [60] These plasma concentrations are in the same 
range as the in vitro concentrations that activated the expression of tumor 
suppressor  gene p16 in three human non -small -cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell 
lines. [61]  
 
Steady state decitabine levels of 0.1  to 0.2 µM were achieved in solid tumor patients 
dosed with 30 mg/m²/day and 40 mg/m²/day by [CONTACT_108660] 72 hours. [62]

In our experience  treating primary patient blasts in vitro , concentrations of 100 – 
500 nM are required maximize methylcytosine reduction without causing cellular 
toxicity. Because decitabine incorporation into DNA is S -phase dependent, 
exposure of cells during cell division is necessary for efficacy.  
  
 
 
 
1.2.2 Experience with  extended dosing schedules  
 
Blum et al recently published their experience treating  elderly AML patients with 
a 10-day course of decitabine 20 mg/m2/day as a 1 -hour infusion .[3] This prolonged 
exposure course was designed to increase the number of AML blast divisions 
exposed to decitabine per cycle. Toxicities were very similar to a  similar regiment 
given as a 3 and 5 day course ,[2, 16]  but the overal l response (CR/PR) was much 
improved (64% vs 25%). In all three  studies, the toxicities were primarily myeloid 
suppression and the resultant infectious and bleeding complications associated with 
leukemic and pharmacologic hematopoietic suppression. Furthermore, Blum et al 
noted that the perce nt methylcytosine reduction was improved (22% vs 11%) as 

Genomic Predictors of Decitabine Response in AML/MDS  
 
Amendment 5 Version date: 04/21/[ADDRESS_360652] clearance (50% of patients who ultimately achieved a CR had 
≤ 5% bone marrow blasts after 1 cycle vs 0% of patients after 2 cycles). Finally, 
like Shen et al, they observed a co rrelation between the extent of methylcytosine 
reduction and response. [28]  This study suggests that improvement in response 
rates and time to response can be achieved by [CONTACT_295785]. Further, that DNA methylcytosine r eduction can be achieved with 
prolonged exposure to decitabine and that this might be a patient -specific biological 
marker of adequate  dosing.  
  
Scandura et al. recently published a study of infusional decitabine prior to 
cytarabine + daunorubicin inductio n therapy for AML. [64] They escalated the 
duration of infusional therapy and reached their planned goal of 20 mg/m2/day x 7 
days of continuous therapy given prior to cytarabine and daunorubicin. They noted 
similar toxicities (primarily hematopoietic and the associated neutropenic 
infections) , but that these were not different from their experience giving cytarabine 
+ daunorubicin alone.  
 
1.3 Correlative Studies  
 
All correlative studies will be collected under  HRPO# 201011766 (“Tissue Acquisition for 
Analysis of Genetic Progression Factors in Hematologic Diseases ”) that all patients will 
be concurrently enrolled in.  The goals of the correlative studies include:  
 
1. To correlate p atient -specific mutations  with response to decitabine . 
We will perform exome sequencing of each patient’s pre-study  bone marrow sample 
and skin sample. We will determine AML/MDS -associated variants found in the bone 
marrow, but not skin sample. We will correlate the presence of mu tations with response 
(especially mutations in DNMT3A,  IDH1, IDH2, and TET2 ). This study is powered to 
identify mutations with >80% sensitivity to predict decitabine response if used as a 
clinical assay.  
 
2. To correlate the v elocity and depth of response  with response to decitabine . 
We will assess tumor burden by [CONTACT_295786] -specific mutations in bone 
marrow samp les collected pre study , Cycle 1 Day 10±1, Cycle 1 Day 28±4 , and Cycle 
2 Day 28 ±4. We will assess mutations in at least 24 recurrently mutated genes 
(including, but not limited to: FLT3, DNMT3A, NPM1, TET2, WT1, IDH1, IDH2, 
RUNX1, NRAS, TP53, U2AF1, KRAS, PHF6, MSTP9, PTPN11, KIT, SMC3, PRUNE2, 
ETV6, CEBPA, SMC1A, ASXL1, STAG2, RAD21 ) as well as all patient -specific 
mutations discovered during exome sequencing. The leukemic allele frequency will be 
measured using the Illumnia MySeq or HiSeq platform using DNA capture by [CONTACT_295787] -oligonucleotides. Patient bone marrow sa mples will be assessed 
pre-study , Cycle 1 D ay 10 ± 1 , Cycle 1 D ay 28 ± 4 , and Cycle 2 D ay 28 ± 4 and 
compared with patient specific skin samples (normal control). The velocity of response 
will be calculated as the natural log rate of patient -specific mutat ion allele frequency 
clearance. Depth of response will be defined as the lowest patient -specific mutation

 Mutational status,  
 Time to disease progression.  
Because all patient -specific exome -discovered mutations will be assessed a second 
time in the primary bone marrow sample as well as the  Cycle 1 Day 10 ± 1, Cycle 1 
Day 28 ± 4, and Cycle 2 Day 28  ± 4 b one marrow samples, t his study will also serve 
to validate all exome -discovered mutations. This is important, because exome 
sequencing is associated with a 20 -50% false -discovery rate depending on type I error 
tolerated  (mutation -calling algorithms are typ ically set for greater sensitivity than 
specificity) .  Thus, many mutations discovered during exome sequencing are incorrect.  
This second analysis of these mutations will server to exclude these false positive calls.  
 
3. To correlate the bone marrow e xpressi on profile  from pre -study  and Cycle 1 Day 10 ± 
1 with response to decitabine . 
We will correlate expression signatures, and changes in expression signatures, with : 
 Achievement of clinical CR,  
 Mutation status . 
 
4. To correlate the extent of b one marrow DNA hypomethylation  on Cycle 1 Day 10 ± 1 
with response to decitabine . 
We will assess the percent reduction in bone marrow methylcytosine content using LC -
MS. Patients will be evaluated pre-study  and Cycle 1 Day 10 ± 1. The change in DNA 
methylcytosine content  will be correlated to:  
 Achievement of clinical CR,  
 Change in expression signature . 
This will determine whether inadequate blast exposure to decitabine correlates with 
drug resistance.

promyelocytic leukemia. AML patients who are < [ADDRESS_360663] not received 
cytotoxic induction chemotherapy are als o excluded , because cytotoxic therapy offers a 
curative possibility for these patients.  MDS patients without cytopenias are also excluded 
because these patients can be followed with watchful -waiting . 
 
All patients will undergo bone marrow biopsies pre-study, on Cycle 1  Day 10 ± 1, and on 
Day 28 ± 4 of Cycles 1, 2, 4, and 6 . Following Cycle 6, bone marrow biopsies should be 
performed at the discretion of the treating physician to assess for relapse or progression . 
Patients will provide a skin biopsy sample pre -study.  See Section 8.0 for details  on 
correlative studies .  
 
Patients will receive decitabine 20 mg/m2/day as a 1 -hour infusion on consecutive Days 1 -
10 in 28 -day cycles.   The dose will be calculated based on  actual patient weight at the 
beginning of each cycle.  
 
Once AML patients achieve morphologic complete remission with incomplete blood count 
recovery (CRi)  or MDS patients achieve a marrow complete response (Marrow CR) as 
defined in Section 9 .0, decitabine  administration may be decreased to 20 mg/m2/day for 
ten consecutive days every 6 weeks,  to limit myelosuppressive toxicity  and improve count 
recovery . After 2 cycles at 6 week intervals, the dose may be reduce to 20 mg/m2/day for 
five consecutive days in 6 week cycles, at the discretion of the treating physician.   After 
two cycles of five consecutive days of treatment, if the patient meets the definition of CR 
with complete cytogenetic response as defined in Section 9 .0, administration  may further 
be decre ased to three  consecutive days per cycle  at the discretion of the  treating physician . 
 
It will be a logistical goal of this trial consistently to return preliminary exome results to 
the treating physician by [CONTACT_42334] 1 and validated results by [CONTACT_42334] 2. 
However, this logistical goal is not a primary or secondary aim of this study. Given the 
limited data regarding mutation presence and drug response, we do not anticipate that the 
results will directly influence therapeutic decisions made by  [CONTACT_1963]. 
However, the development of comprehensive genomic pi[INVESTIGATOR_295739] a clinical trial setting will be required before personalized medicine can be 
realized.

Amendment 5 Version date: 04/21/16   Page 24 of 51 6.0 DOSE MODIFICATIONS  
 
A criterion for discontinuation of the study is a delay of > 8 weeks between any two cycles.  
 
6.1 Delay for Cytopenia or Infection  
 
As cytopenias are a defining feature of AML and MDS, their presence alone does not 
generally warrant dose modifications or delays. Patients will receive four cycles of therapy 
without adjustment for any cytopenia.  Following Cycle 4, dose modifications or delays for 
cytopenias will be made at the discretion of the investigator .  
 
Patients with febrile neutropenia (temperature ≥ 38.5° with ANC < 1,000/ l) or systemic 
infections should hav e treatment held until clinical resolution of the infection.  
 
6.2 Delay for Organ Dysfunction  
 
If ren al dysfunction (creatinine ≥ 3  X institutional upper limit of normal) or hepatic 
dysfunction ( bilirubin ≥ 2.5  mg/dl or ALT/AST ≥ 3 X institutional upper limit of normal)  
occurs, therapy may not resume until the abnormalities have resolved to below the limits 
stated above. If renal or hepatic dysfunction occurs during  a treatment course, the next dose 
of decitabine should be held, and  serum chemistries should be checked twice per week.  
Decitabine can be resumed at full dose when creatinine, bilirubin, ALT and AST are below 
the limits listed above.  
 
For grade 3 -4 non -hematologic toxicities  related to decitabine , decitabine treatment s hould 
be delayed until recovery to baseline or to grade ≤ 1. Decitabine may be reintroduced with 
a 50% dose reduction, or at full dose at the discretion of the investigator.  
 
6.3 Modification in Dose or Schedule  for Treatment Response  
 
Once AML patients achiev e morphologic complete remission with incomplete blood count 
recovery (CRi)  or MDS patients achieve a marrow complete response (Marrow CR) as 
defined in Section 9 .0, decitabine administration may be decreased to 20 mg/m2/day for 
ten consecutive days, and t he cycles may be administered every 6 weeks  to limit 
myelosuppressive toxicity , at the discretion of the  treating physician. After two cycles at 
six week intervals, the dose may be reduced to 20 mg/m2/day for five consecutive days of 
treatment  in six week intervals . If the patient meets the definition of CR with complete 
cytogenetic response as defined in Section 9 .0, administration  may further be decrease d to 
three  consecutive days per cycle  at the discretion of the  treating physician .

Amendment 5 Version date: 04/21/[ADDRESS_360674] by [CONTACT_295804], a major mechanism for gene expression. In some cancer cells, 
hypermethylation blocks the activity of tumor suppressor genes, which regulate cell 
division and differentiation to prevent malignant transformation. When suppressor g ene 
activity is blocked, cell division becomes unregulated, leading to the formation of 
neoplastic cells. Decitabine regulates DNA methylation (specifically targets the 
methyltransferase , DNMT1 ), effectively demethylating and reactivating different tumor 
suppressor genes. Because hypermethylation occurs early in the malignant transformation 
of cells, decitabine may have activity in chemoprevention. Other possible mechanisms for 
decitabine activity include cytotoxicity due to incorporation into DNA similar t o other 
antimetabolites, methylation -independent induction of gene expression, and degradation of 
DNA methyltransferase 1.

A secondary  endpoint of this study is to estimate morphologic complete remission rate.  
  
9.1 Response Criteria  - AML  
 
AML Patients will be assessed for response according to the IWG criteria:1  
 
Morphologic complete remission  (CR)  – Defined as morphologic leukemia -free state, 
defined as less than 5% blasts in aspi[INVESTIGATOR_295740] a count of ≥200 
nucleated cells and no blasts with Auer rods or any persis tence of extramedullary disease. 
When erythroid precursors cons titute less than 50% of bone marrow nucleated cells, the 
percentage of blasts is based on all nucleated cells; when there are 50% or more erythroid 
cells, the percentage blasts should be based on the nonerythroid cells. The presence of mild 
megaloblastoid changes may be permitted if they are thought to be consistent with 
treatment effect. However, persistence of pretreatment abnormalities (eg, pseudo -Pelger -
Hüet cells, ringed sideroblasts, dysplastic megakaryocytes) are not consistent with CR.   In 
addition,  ANC >1000/μl and platelet count of ≥100,000/μl. Patient must be independent of 
transfusions. No duration requirement for this designation.  
 
Cytogenetic complete remission (CCR) – Defined as morphologic complete remission plus 
a reversion to a normal karyo type. For this study, reversion of a normal karyotype is 
defined as no clonal abnormalities detected in a minimum of 20 mitotic cells.  
 
Morphologic complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery  (CRi)  – Defined as 
morphologic complete recovery with the exception of neutropenia <1000/μl or 
thrombocytopenia <100,000/μl.  
 
Partial remission  (PR) – Defined as meeting the above criteria for complete remission, 
with the following exceptions: decrease of ≥50% in the percentage of blast to 5 -25% in the 
bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337]. A value of 5% blasts in bone marrow with Auer rods present may 
also be considered a partial remissi on.  
 
Stable Disease (SD) – Defined as not meeting th e definitions of CR, CRi, PR, PD , or 
recurrence/morphologic relapse.   
 
Progressive disease  (PD) – Defined as a clear increase in bone marrow blast count, 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] a greater than 50% increase compared with baseline , or new extramedullary 
disease . Patients with a > 50% increase in peripheral blast count with an increase of the 
total peripheral white blood cell count to > 10,000/ l should undergo evaluation by [CONTACT_295793] .  
 
Recurrence/morphologic relapse  - Defined as relapse following complete remission is 
defined as reappearance of blasts in the blood or the finding of ≥ 5% blasts in the bone 
marrow, not attributable to any other cause. New dysplastic changes is considered relapse. 
Genomic Predictors of Decitabine Response in AML/MDS  
 
Amendment 5 Version date: 04/21/16   Page 28 of 51 If there are no blasts in the peripheral blood and 5 -20% blasts in the bone marrow, bone 
marrow biopsy should be repeated in > 1 week to confir m relapse.

CR but will be noted.  
 
Marrow Complete Response ( Marrow CR) – Defined as < 5% myeloblasts in the bone 
marrow and a decrease by > 50% from pretreatment values, but not meeting the definition 
of CR above.  
 
Partial Remission ( PR) – Defined as meeting the definition of CR above with a decrease 
of myeloeblasts in the bone marrow by > 50% from pretreatment values, but absolute 
myeloblas ts still >5%.  
 
Stable Disease (SD) – Defined as not meeting the definitions of CR, Marrow CR, PR, SD, 
PD, or recurrence/morphologic relapse.   
 
Progressive Disease//Relapse  (PD) – Defined as ≥ 50% increase in blasts to > 5% blasts 
(for patients with less than 5% blasts at baseline only), ≥ 50% increase to > 10% blasts (for 
patients with 5 -10% blasts at baseline only), ≥ 50% increase to > 20% blasts (for patients 
with l0 -20% blasts at baseline only), ≥ 50% increase to > 30% blasts (for patients with 20 -
30% blasts at baseline only) or any of the following: At least 50% decrement from 
maximum remission/response in granulocytes or platelets, reduction in Hgb by ≥ 2 g/dL,

Erythroid response requires all of the following (only required if pretreatment HgB 
<11 g/dL):  
 Hgb increase by ≥ 1.5 g/dL  
 Relevant reduction of units of RBC transfusions by [CONTACT_27751] 4 RBC transfusions/8 wk compared with the pretreatment transfu sion 
number in the previous 8 wk. Only RBC transfusions given for a Hgb of ≤ 9.0 
g/dL pretreatment will count in the RBC transfusion response evaluation

The Washington University Human Research Protection Office (HRPO) requires that all events 
meeting the definition of u nanticipated problem or serious noncompliance be reported as outlined 
in Section 10.2. 
 
The FDA requires that all serious and unexpected adverse events be reported as outlined in Section 
10.6.  In addition, any fatal or life -threatening adverse experiences  where there is a reasonable 
possibility of relationship to study intervention must be reported.  
 
10.1 Definitions  
 
10.1.1  Adverse Events (AEs)  
 
Definition:   any unfavorable medical occurrence in a human subject including any 
abnormal sign, symptom, or disease.  
 
Grading:   the descriptions and grading scales found in the revised NCI Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 will be utilized for 
all toxicity reporting.  A copy of the CTCAE version 4.0 can be downloaded from 
the CTEP web site :  http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html .  Grade [ADDRESS_360679] fifty enrolled patients. Subsequently, only events 
graded as 3 or greater will be recorded. Fifty patients should be sufficient to 
estimate the true incidence of any adverse event to within ± 14% with 95% 
confidence intervals.  
 
Attribution (relatedness), Expectedness, and Seriousness:  the definitions for the 
terms listed that should be used are those p rovided by [CONTACT_1762]’ Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP).  A copy of 
this guidance can be found on OHRP’s website: 
(http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/policy/Ad vEvntGuid.htm ). 
 
10.1.2  Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
 
Definition:  any adverse drug experience occurring at any dose that results in any 
of the following outcomes:

Amendment 5 Version date: 04/21/[ADDRESS_360680] be reported to the FDA.  
 
10.1.3  Unexpected Adverse Experience  
 
Definition:  any adverse drug experience, the specificity or severity of which is not 
consistent with the current investigator brochure (or risk information, if an IB is not 
required or available).  
 
Events that are both serious AND unexpected must be reported to the F DA.  
 
10.1.4  Life-Threatening Adverse Experience  
 
Definition:  any adverse drug experience that places the subject (in the view of the 
investigator) at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred, i.e., it does 
not include a reaction that, had it  occurred in a more severe form, might have caused 
death.  
 
Life-threatening adverse experiences must be reported to the FDA.  
 
10.1.5  Unanticipated Problems  
 
Definition:  
 
 unexpected (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency) given (a) the research 
procedures tha t are described in the protocol -related documents, such as the 
IRB-approved research protocol and informed consent document; and (b) 
the characteristics of the subject population being studied;  
 related or possibly related to participation in the research ( in this guidance 
document, possibly related means there is a reasonable possibility that the 
incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_182821]); and  
 suggests that the research places subjects or others at a gr eater risk of harm 
(including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was 
previously known or recognized.  
 
10.1.6  Noncompliance  
 
Definition:  failure to follow any applicable regulation or institutional policies that 
govern human subjects research or failure to follow the determinations of the 
IRB.   Noncompliance may occur due to lack of knowledge or due to deliberate 
choice to ignore regulatio ns, institutional policies, or determinations of the IRB.

Amendment 5 Version date: 04/21/16   Page 33 of 51 10.1.7  Serious Noncompliance  
 
Definition:  noncompliance that materially increases risks, that results in substantial 
harm to subjects or others, or that materially compromises the rights or welfare of 
participants.  
 
10.1.8  Protocol Exceptions  
 
Definition:  A planned deviation from the approved protocol that are under the 
research team’s control. Exceptions apply only to a single participant or a singular 
situation.  
 
Local IRB Pre-approval of all protocol exception s must be obtained prior to the 
event.   For secondary sites, the Washington University PI [INVESTIGATOR_17027] l issue approval of the 
exception, but it must also be submitted to the local IRB with documentation of 
approval forwarded to Washington University.  Washington Un iversity IRB  
approval is not required for protocol exceptions occurring at secondary sites.

14.1 Analysis Populations  
 
Intent -to-Treat  - The intent -to-treat (ITT) population will be defined as all patients wh o 
receive at least one dose of decitabine .  
 
Efficacy -Evaluable  - The efficacy -evaluable (EE) population will be defined as all patients 
who receive at least one cycle of treatment.   
 
Safety  - The safety population will be defined as all pati ents with at least one dose of 
decitabine . 
 
14.2 Statistical Analysis  
 
14.2.1  Descriptiv e Analyses  
 
Patient Disposition : The number of patients discontinued, the reasons for 
discontinuation, and the number of cycles administered will be summarized.  
 
Demographics and Baseline Characteristics : Descriptive summary statistics will 
be provided for  demographic and important baseline characteristics.  For 
continuous variables, the number of patients, mean, standard deviation, median, 
minimum and maximum will be provided.  For categorical variables, the number 
and percent of patients in each demograph ic/characteristic category will be 
summarized.  
 
14.2.2  Primary Endpoint Analysis  
 
The primary end -point of this phase II study is the correlation biomarkers with 
overall response in AML/MDS patients to decitabine.  
 
We will correlate the presence of patient specific mutations  (especially mutations  
in DNMT3A, IDH1, IDH2, and TET2 ) with overall response rates. Mutation rates 
in these genes and in other patient -specific genes will be correlated with overall 
response and t heir respective 95% confidence intervals will be provided.  
 
Statistical considerations. The relationship between AML/MDS -associated 
mutations and the responsiveness to decitabine will be described by [CONTACT_295797] -square test or Fisher’s exact test as appropriate. The 
differentially expressed genes between responders and non -responders will be 
determined using the significance analysis of microarray (SAM). Multivariate 
logistic regression will also be fit to adjust the potential confounding effects of other 
demographic and clinical characteristics. The resultant critical P values will be 
corrected for multiple testing.  Since the Bonferroni correction is known to be too 
conservative, a permutation analysis (e.g., 10,000 random assignments for 
Genomic Predictors of Decitabine Response in AML/MDS  
 
Amendment 5 Version date: 04/21/16   Page 41 of 51 responsive status) will be u sed to derive an empi[INVESTIGATOR_295745] P value.  The new 
critical p -value is the number of permutation tests which yield a lower p -value than 
the original test divided by [CONTACT_295798]. [61]   
 
A power analysis was performed using Chi -square test for the association between 
mutation and response to decitabine. The frequency of DNMT3A, IDH1/2, and 
TET2 mutations in AML and MDS patients are each between 15% and 30% in 
multiple cohorts. [29-37] Table 3  shows the minimal detectable differences of 
response rates between mutant and wild -type cases, assuming an expected overall 
45% CR/CRi rate and 80% power. For an average of 20% frequency of a mutated 
gene, for example, 100 patients will provide 80% power to detect 30% difference 
at a [ADDRESS_360688] 
30% of clinical response 
could be attributed to the 
presence of a sp ecific 
mutation. However, we 
anticipate that more power 
could be achieved as we 
assess patient groups with 
combined characteristics (e.g. 
DNMT3A mutation or loss of 
DNMT3A expression). In 
addition, we expect that the 
majority of the enrolled 125 
patients c an be used in the analysis (since all of our molecular information will be 
acquired within 30 days of enrollment, we anticipate a drop -out rate of 20% or less).  
 
14.2.3  Secondary Endpoint Analyses  
 
The overall response rate (CR/CRi/PR) and complete response rate (CR/CRi) will 
be compared with historical controls [2], and the 95% confidence intervals will be 
provided.  
 
The rate of patient spe cific mutation clearance after 10, 28, and 56 days of therapy 
will be determined using an Illumina based platform. We will compare the rate of 
mutation clearance between the patients wh o achieve a CR/CRi after 4 cycles and 
those who do not.  We anticipate that we will identify between 6 and 25 exonic 
SNVs per case (the range obtained with >200 AML samples sequenced to date with 
whole genome or exome sequencing), and that the expected 95% confidence 
interval of the mean variant allele frequency will be ±2.56% and ±1.25%, Table 3 . Detectable mutation associated response rates  (80% power, α = 0.05)

Amendment 5 Version date: 04/21/[ADDRESS_360689] deviation of 3.2% within the 
same clone. The change of tumor burden over time and its association with clinical 
response will  be assessed using [ADDRESS_360690] ANOVA for repeated measurement data, 
followed by [CONTACT_295799] -hoc multiple comparisons for between -group differences (e.g., 
responders vs. non -responders) at given time points as well as the between -time 
differences within each grou p. The resultant critical P values will also be corrected 
using permutation analysis for multiple testing.  
 
The percent decrease in bone marrow  methylcytosine will be calculated on day 
10±1. We will compare this reduction with previously published data and between 
the patients who achieve CR/CRi and those who do not.  The correlation of peak 
plasma  levels of decitabine with response will be assessed using [ADDRESS_360691] ANOVA 
for repeated measurement data, followed b y the ad -hoc multiple comparisons for 
between -group differences (e.g., responders vs. non -responders) and between -time 
differences. Similar analyses will be performed for the correlation of expression 
profiles and SNP analysis with pharmacokinetic data.   
 
Statistical power justification.   A power analysis was performed using two -sample 
t-test for between -group difference and paired t -test for the change over time. For 
tumor clearance, this will provide > 99% power to detect a 10% difference in the 
means at  two separate time points for clones with 6 or more variants, and > 98% 
power to detect a 15% difference if there are 3 or more variants per clone with α = 
0.05 (power will decrease to 91% and 82%, respectively, in cases where the 
standard deviation is 4.7 %, the maximum we have observe d thus far). For 
pharmacologic correlations, we anticipate 85% power to determine a 25 ng/ml 
difference between the average C max of 45 evaluable responders and 55 evaluable 
non-responders with an anticipated average C max of 70  ng/ml and a standard 
deviation of 40 ng/ml within the entire cohort, and with α = 0.05. [22] We believe a 
less significant difference would n ot be sufficient to warrant application in clinical 
decision making (i.e. whether to continue therapy for more than 1 cycle). We 
anticipate 99% power to determine a difference of 20% in the reduction of bone 
marrow methylcytosine between [ADDRESS_360692] deviation of 15% and α = 0.05. [28, 66-68] 
The difference in methylcytosine reduction previously observed was 30% between 
patients achieving CR/PR and those  with only hematologic improvement. [28]  
 
Time to relapse and time to death will also be listed for each patient.

Amendment 4 Version date: 04/16/15   Page 4 of 51  
Study Schema:  
 
 
Patients with p rogressive disease after two cycles ( defined as a clear increase in bone marrow blast count, typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] a 
> 50% increase in bone marrow blasts over baseline ) should be removed from study . 
Patients with stable disease may conti nue on study and should undergo a diagnostic bone marrow biopsy at the end 
of even numbered cycles.  
Once AML patients achieve morphologic complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery ( CRi) or MDS 
patients achieve a marrow complete response (Marrow CR) as defined in Section 9 .0, decitabine 
administration may be decreased to 20 mg/m2/day for ten consecutive days every 6 weeks, to limit 
myelosuppressive toxicity  and improve count recovery . After 2 cycles at 6 week intervals, the dose may be 
reduce to 20 mg/m2/day for five consecutive days  in 6 week cycles, at the discretion of the treating physcian.  
After two cycles of five consecutive days of treatment, if the patient meets the definition of CR with complete 
cytogenetic response as defined in Section 9 .0, administration may further be decreased to three  consecutive 
days per cycle  at the discretion of the  treating physician.  
Sample collection for correlative studies:  
Bone marrow biopsies should be performed at baseline , at Cycle 1 Day 10 ± 1 , and at Day 28  ± 4 of Cycles 
1, 2, 4, and 6 . Following Cycle 6, bone marrow biopsies should be performed at the discretion of the 
treating physician to assess for relapse or progression.

Amendment 4 Version date: 04/16/15   Page 8 of 51 1.0 INTRODUCTIO N 
 
1.1 Rational e   
 
Personalized therapy for cancer requires that 1) patient -specific factors (e.g. patient -
specific mutations, expression profiles, or pharmacogenomics) influence treatment 
algorithms, and 2) once therapy is initiated, in vivo  responsiveness is used to guide further 
therapy. The modern era of genomics has provided significant insights into cancer 
pathogenesis by [CONTACT_295778], as well as defining 
disease -specific patterns of gene expression. However, the application and i ntegration of 
this data with therapeutics remains a difficult task.  
 
Decitabine is a commonly used single -agent therapy for patients with acute myeloid 
leukemia ( AML ) and/or myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ). Historically, it has yielded 
clinical complete res ponses in approximately 25% of patients across diverse clinical trials, 
it is well tolerated, and it can be given as in the outpatient  setting . However, the majority 
of patients do not respond to decitabine, the molecular etiology of decitabine sensitivity  is 
unknown, and there are no algorithms to predict patient responsiveness a priori or even 
within one month of starting therapy.   
 
AML and MDS are two closely related hematological disorder s characterized by 
[CONTACT_295779].  Both AML 
and MDS frequently occur  in elderly patients and some cases are secondary and/or related 
to long -term bone marrow damage after radiation or chemotherapy. Current therapy for 
AML consists of cytotoxic chemotherapy follo wed by [CONTACT_295780]. Using these approaches, current cure rates may be as high as 60% for 
patients younger than 60 with good risk cytogenetics (e.g. t(15;17 ), t(8;21), inv(16)) .[4]  
Outcomes in patients ≥ 60 years old and with relapsed disease remain poor with 2 year 
survival  of only ~25%. [5] Historically, t he available treatment for MDS has been 
symptomatic and has not been shown to be effecti ve in producing sustained improvement 
in hematopoiesis or in delaying leukemic evolution [6, 7] .  
 
Current  AML therapy is poorly tolerated in elderly and pre -treated patients due to  
hematologic and non -hematologic toxicities; following such therapy, patients typi[INVESTIGATOR_295732] 3 -4 weeks of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] f or treatment of neutropenic fevers and for regular 
transfusions . Even among the relatively healthy patients enrolled in clinical trials, induction 
mortality in the elderly can be as high as 20 -40% following standard induction therapy ,[8-
11] and moderate to severe non -hematolog ic toxicity occurs in at least an additional 30% 
of patients. [9, 12 -14] Consequently, many older AML patients are not offered traditional 
intensive chemotherapy, but receive supportive care alone. [15]  More effective and less 
toxic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_295734] a significant proportion of 
elder ly AML in population s. 
 
Decitabine has been studied in  MDS patients and in  elderly  and/or relapsed  AML patients . 
It has been found to be reasonably well tolerated, can be given in the  outpat ient setting , 
and has overall response rates of 20 -45%.[2, 3, 16 -20] Our own experience has been of 
Genomic Predictors of  Decitabine Response in AML/MDS  
 
Amendment 4 Version date: 04/16/15   Page 9 of 51 CR/PR rates of 25% , [2] and this is typi[INVESTIGATOR_295735] (reviewed in [21]  Decitabine is an S -phase depended drug.  [22 -24] However,  
decitabine is usually administered  in one hour daily infusions  during 3  to 5 consecutive 
days (too short to expose decitabine to most AM L blasts  during at least 2 cycles of 
replication , which divide every 2  to 7 days). [25-27]  Recent experience with increasing the 
number of infusion s per cycle from 5 consecutive da ys to 10 consecutive days has 
improved overall response rates to 67%. [3] Response to decitabine can be slow, sometimes 
requiring 3  to 5 cycles before maximum response is observed. [2] As a consequence, many 
patients are exposed to prolonged therapy, gaining little benefit, before determining 
resistance. There are currently no biomarkers that predict respon se to decitabine.  
 
Decitabine is a cytosine analogue that cannot be methylated. Incorporation of decitabine 
into DNA prevents DNA methylation at cytosine residues and derepresses epi[INVESTIGATOR_295736]. Therefore, the reduction in total ge nomic DNA methylcytosine 
content acts as a marker of effective decitabine dosing. Indeed, two groups have recently 
correlated effective methylcytosine reduction and gene expression derepression to 
response  (Figure 1.1) .[3, 28] 
 
  
   
Figure 1.1. From Shen et al JCO (2010) 28:611 and Blum et al JCO (2007) 25: [ADDRESS_360720] recently  used whole genome sequencing to identify  recurrent, somatic 
mutations in AML and MDS patients in four genes that are involved in methylcytosine 
regulation: DNMT3A, IDH1, IDH2, and TET2. [29-37] Collectively, nearly half of all 
AML/MDS patients have a mutation in one of these four genes.  DNMT3A mutations are 
associated with an adverse outcome in AML patients trea ted with cytotoxic 
chemotherapy. [35, 38] However, it is not yet clear whether the presence of mutations in 
one or more of these genes is associated with response or resistance to decitabine.  
 
In this study, we will treat patients with the current state -of-the-art decitabine schedule. [3] 
We will perform exome sequencing on all patients and correlate response with mutation 
status, rate of mutat ion clearance , expression profile, plasma  decitabine levels , and DNA 

Genomic Predictors of  Decitabine Response in AML/MDS  
 
Amendment 4 Version date: 04/16/[ADDRESS_360721] share d mutations in many of the same genes , 
shared patterns of mutati on acquisition, and shared patterns of mutation evolution .[39, 40] 
Furthermore, MDS, like AML , presents  with clonal hematopoiesis, even when the 
morphologic blast count is zero. [36]Because this study will identify and track the rate of 
clearance of patient specific mutations, and because decitabine has been shown to have 
efficacy in both AML and MDS patients,  [2, 3, 16 -19, 41 -45] combining analys is of AML 
and MDS patients is reasonable.   Asymptomatic MDS patients are excluded because these 
patients are typi[INVESTIGATOR_295737] -waiting rather than with chemotherapy.  
  
1.2 Decitabine  and Hypomethylating agents in AML /MDS  
 
Methylation of cytosine  in the CpG dinucleotide by [CONTACT_295781] a 
significant mechanism for the loss of tumor suppressor gene expression in human cancer, 
including AML  and MDS .[46, 47] Like azacitidine , decitabine  (5-aza-2’-deoxycitidine) is 
incorporated into DNA during S phase and forms covalent adducts with DNA 
methyltransferase. The irreversible inhibition  of this enzyme results in loss of methylation 
and is associated with differentiation. [48]  Decitabine is an appr oximately [ADDRESS_360722] at higher doses  (1-2 µM) .[49]  
 
Decitabine  has been investigated in hematologic malignancies using a range of doses and 
schedules.  It is currently FDA approved for the treatment of adults with MDS at a dose of 
15 mg/m2 every 8 hours for 3 days, based on a Phase III study that demonstrated improve d 
outcomes in the treatment arm compared to patients treated with supportive care alone. [15]  
However, the overall response rate  in this trial w as modest ( 17%). Of note, 18% of the 
patients in th is trial had 20 -30% bone marrow blasts, meeting the current WHO criteria for 
AML.  Subsequent p hase I and II s tudies in AML, using a variety of low -dose decitabine 
regimens, have reporte d overall response rates of 22 -49%.[2, 3, 16 -19, 41 -45] Comparisons 
of multiple low dose schedules have no ted improved efficacy in the MDS population using 
a dose of 20 mg/m2 on Days 1 -5 of a 28 -day cycle. [50, 51 ] Because of these results, we 
have recently explored this dosing schedule in the treatment of elderly patients with 
AML. [52] In this study, we observe d an overall response rate of 24 %, and an additional  
44% of patients achiev ed stable disease during a median of 5 monthly cycles. [48] In this 
study, we noted that decitabine  does not act quickly and the median time to response was 
3 months. These results are similar to the recently published experience in [LOCATION_013] 
treating 227 patients with 15 mg/m2 over 3 hours TID for 3 days every 6 weeks, which 
resulted in a CR/PR rate of 26%. [16]

Amendment 4 Version date: 04/16/15   Page 11 of 51 A recent study using a prolonged administration schedule (20 mg/m2 IV over 1 hour  on 
consecutive days 1 -10) showed improved  response (64 % CR/PR) and improved time to 
respond (50% of patients had bone marrow blasts < 5% after 1 cycle of therapy). [3]  These 
results are an improvement over previous experience by [CONTACT_295782], and this experi ence is

In general, decitabine  is well tolerated. Unlike conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy, 
decitabine  can be administered in the outpatient setting. However, AML  and MDS are  
aggressive hematologic malignanc ies. Cy topenias commonly result from AML /MDS  
inhibition of normal hematopoiesis , and often do not resolve until a complete response is 
achieved. Thus, neutropenic sepsis and thrombocytopenic bleeding remain significant  
problems regardless  of therapy, especially during the first 4 -8 weeks. In our experience 
treating elderly AML patients, neutropenia occurred in 24%, sepsis in 9% , and bacteremia 
in 7%.  Similar results have been observed in MDS patients. [20, 53, 54 ] As a result, death 
is not uncommon in the first 8 weeks of therapy, occurring in 15 -17% of patients, and most 
commonly resulting from infection  and cytope nias related to disease and the rapy.[16, 52, 
55] While unsettling, these numbers are better than many historical patients  treated with 
cytotoxic chemotherapy , and suggest a need for continued improve ments in therapy .[9, 12]

1.2.1 Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism of Decitabine  
 
In human subjects , after IV administration, decitabine displayed a distribution phase 
with a half -life of 7 minutes and a terminal phase elimination half -life of 10-35 
minutes as measured by [CONTACT_295783]. [56, 57]   The short plasma half -life is d ue to rapid 
inactivation of decitabine by [CONTACT_295784]. [23] Total 
body clearance (Cl p) in humans was high with a mean value of 126 mL/min/kg. [58]  
 
Among five adult patients with advanced solid tumors administered seven courses 
of 100 mg/m2 of decitabine by 1 -hour infusions, [56] maximum plasma 
concentration ranged from [ADDRESS_360726] infusion 
and a slower decline over the next two hours to 6 nM, the level of detectability. 
Plasma half -life (mean SE) was estimated to be appro ximately 7 1 minutes in the 
initial phase (t ½α) and 355 minutes in the second phase (t ½β). The area under the 
plasma concentration -time curve was 408 88 ng.hour/mL for these patients, with a 
peak plasma concentration of 2.01 0.44 µM (0.440.1 µg/mL), while mean volume 
of distribution (Vd ss) and CLp was 4.59 1.42 L/kg and 126 21 mL/min/kg, 
respectively. The time course of DAC concentrations was similar in 1 of 2 patients 
administered 75 mg/m2, while DAC was usually undetectable in the plasma of 
patients  administered 25 to 60 mg/m2. 
 
Using a longer infusion time (up to 40 hours), Rivard et al. [57] reported a plasma 
concentration of 0.1 to 0.4 g/mL. With in fusion times of 40 -60 hours, at an infusion 
rate of 1 mg/kg/h, plasma concentrations of 0.43 -0.76 µg/mL were achieved. [59]  The 
steady -state plasma concentration at an infusion rate of 1  mg/kg/h was estimated to 
be 0.2 -0.5 µg/mL . The half -life after discontinuing the infusion was 12 -20 min.[57]  
 
Urinary excretion of unchanged decitabine was low, ranging from less than 0.01% to 
0.9% of the total dose, and there was no relationship between excretion and dose or 
plasma drug levels. High clearance values and a total urinary excretion of <1% of the 
administered dose suggest that decitabine is eliminated rapi[INVESTIGATOR_295738], including extrahepatic metabolism. [60] 
 
The steady state plasma concentrations (C ss) ranged from 0.31 to 0.39 µg/mL (1.27 
to 1.60 µM) during the infusion of 100 mg/m² decitabine over a 6 -hour period. [61] 
The range of concentrations during a 600 mg/m2 infusion over an 8 -hour period  was 
0.41-16 g/mL (1.68 to 4.76 µM). [60] These plasma concentrations are in the same 
range as the in vitro concentrations that activated the expression of tumor 
suppressor  gene p16 in three human non -small -cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell 
lines. [61]  
 
Steady state decitabine levels of 0.1  to 0.2 µM were achieved in solid tumor patients 
dosed with 30 mg/m²/day and 40 mg/m²/day by [CONTACT_108660] 72 hours. [62]

In our experience  treating primary patient blasts in vitro , concentrations of 100 – 
500 nM are required maximize methylcytosine  reduction without causing cellular 
toxicity. Because decitabine incorporation into DNA is S -phase dependent, 
exposure of cells during cell division is necessary for efficacy.  
  
 
 
 
1.2.2 Experience with  extended dosing schedules  
 
Blum et al recently published their experience treating  elderly AML patients with 
a 10-day course of decitabine 20 mg/m2/day as a 1 -hour infusion .[3] This prolonged 
exposure course was designed to increase the number of AML blast divisions 
exposed to decitabine per cycle. Toxicities were very similar to a  similar regiment 
given as a 3 and 5 day course ,[2, 16]  but the overal l response (CR/PR) was much 
improved (64% vs 25%). In all three  studies, the toxicities were primarily myeloid 
suppression and the resultant infectious and bleeding complications associated with 
leukemic and pharmacologic hematopoietic suppression. Furthermore, Blum et al 
noted that the percent methylcytosine reduction was improved (22% vs 11%) as 

Genomic Predictors of  Decitabine Response in AML/MDS  
 
Amendment 4 Version date: 04/16/[ADDRESS_360727] clearance (50% of patients who ultimately achieved a CR had 
≤ 5% bone marrow blasts after 1 cycle vs 0% of patients after 2 cycles). Finally, 
like Shen et al, they obse rved a correlation between the extent of methylcytosine 
reduction and response. [28]  This study suggests that improvement in response 
rates and time to response can be achieved by [CONTACT_295785]. Further, that DNA methylcy tosine reduction can be achieved with 
prolonged exposure to decitabine and that this might be a patient -specific biological 
marker of adequate  dosing.  
  
Scandura et al. recently published a study of infusional decitabine prior to 
cytarabine + daunorubicin induction therapy for AML. [64] They escalated the 
duration of infusional therapy and reached their planned goal of 20 mg/m2/day x 7 
days of continuous therapy given prior to cytarabine and daunorubicin. They noted 
similar toxicities (primarily hematopoietic and the associated neutropenic 
infections) , but that these were not different from their experience giving cytarabine 
+ daunorubicin alone.  
 
1.3 Correlative Studies  
 
All correlative studies will be collected under HRPO# 201011766 (“Tissue Acquisition for 
Analysis of Genetic Progression Factors in Hematologic Diseases ”) that all patients will 
be concurrently enrolled in.  The goals of the correlative studies include:  
 
1. To correlate p atient -specific mutations  with response to decitabine . 
We will perform exome sequencing of each patient’s pre-study  bone marrow sample 
and skin sample. We will determine AML/MDS -associated variants found in the bone 
marrow, but not skin sample. We will correlate the presence of mu tations with response 
(especially mutations in DNMT3A,  IDH1, IDH2, and TET2 ). This study is powered to 
identify mutations with >80% sensitivity to predict decitabine response if used as a 
clinical assay.  
 
2. To correlate the v elocity and depth of response  with response to decitabine . 
We will assess tumor burden by [CONTACT_295786] -specific mutations in bone 
marrow samp les collected pre study , Cycle 1 Day 10±1, Cycle 1 Day 28±4 , and Cycle 
2 Day 28 ±4. We will assess mutations in at least 24 recurrently mutated genes 
(including, but not limited to: FLT3, DNMT3A, NPM1, TET2, WT1, IDH1, IDH2, 
RUNX1, NRAS, TP53, U2AF1, KRAS, PHF6, MSTP9, PTPN11, KIT, SMC3, PRUNE2, 
ETV6, CEBPA, SMC1A, ASXL1, STAG2, RAD21 ) as well as all patient -specific 
mutations discovered during exome sequencing. The leukemic allele frequency will be 
measured using the Illumnia MySeq or HiSeq platform using DNA capture by [CONTACT_295787] -oligonucleotides. Patient bone marrow sa mples will be assessed 
pre-study , Cycle 1 D ay 10 ± 1 , Cycle 1 D ay 28 ± 4 , and Cycle 2 D ay 28 ± 4 and 
compared with patient specific skin samples (normal control). The velocity of response 
will be calculated as the natural log rate of patient -specific mutat ion allele frequency 
clearance. Depth of response will be defined as the lowest patient -specific mutation 
Genomic Predictors of  Decitabine Response in AML/MDS  
 
Amendment 4 Version date: 04/16/15   Page 15 of 51 allele frequency in a bone marrow sample. The velocity and depth of tumor response 
will be correlated to:  
 Achievement of clinical CR,  
 Time to best res ponse,  
 Mutational status,  
 Time to disease progression.  
Because all patient -specific exome -discovered mutations will be assessed a second 
time in the primary bone marrow sample as well as the  Cycle 1 Day 10 ± 1, Cycle 1 
Day 28 ± 4, and Cycle 2 Day 28  ± 4 b one marrow samples, t his study will also serve 
to validate all exome -discovered mutations. This is important, because exome 
sequencing is associated with a 20 -50% false -discovery rate depending on type I error 
tolerated  (mutation -calling algorithms are typ ically set for greater sensitivity than 
specificity) .  Thus, many mutations discovered during exome sequencing are incorrect.  
This second analysis of these mutations will server to exclude these false positive calls.  
 
3. To correlate the bone marrow e xpressi on profile  from pre -study  and Cycle 1 Day 10 ± 
1 with response to decitabine . 
We will correlate expression signatures, and changes in expression signatures, with : 
 Achievement of clinical CR,  
 Mutation status . 
 
 
4. To correlate the extent of b one marrow DNA hypomethylation  on Cycle 1 Day 10 ± 1 
with response to decitabine . 
We will assess the percent reduction in bone marrow methylcytosine content using LC -
MS. Patients will be evaluated pre-study  and Cycle 1 Day 10 ± 1. The change in DNA 
methylcytosine content  will be correlated to:  
 Achievement of clinical CR,  
 Change in expression signature . 
This will determine whether inadequate blast exposure to decitabine correlates with 
drug resistance.

promyelocytic leukemia. AML patients who are < [ADDRESS_360738] not received 
cytotoxic induction chemotherapy are also excluded , because cytotoxic therapy offers a 
curat ive possibility for these patients.  MDS patients without cytopenias are also excluded 
because these patients can be followed with watchful -waiting . 
 
All patients will undergo bone marrow biopsies pre-study,  on Cycle 1  Day 10 ± 1, and on 
Day 28 ± 4 of Cycles 1, 2, 4, and 6 . Following Cycle 6, bone marrow biopsies should be 
performed at the discretion of the treating physician to assess for relapse or progression . 
Patients will provide a skin biopsy sample pre -study.  See Section 8.0 for details  on 
correlativ e studies .  
 
Patients will receive decitabine 20 mg/m2/day as a 1 -hour infusion on consecutive Days 1 -
10 in 28 -day cycles.   The dose will be calculated based on actual patient weight at the 
beginning of each cycle.  
 
Once AML patients achieve morphologic complete remission with incomplete blood count 
recovery (CRi)  or MDS patients achieve a marrow complete response (Marrow CR) as 
defined in Section 9 .0, decitabine administration may be decreased to 20 mg/m2/day for 
ten consecutive days every 6 weeks,  to limit myelosuppressive toxicity  and improve count 
recovery . After 2 cycles at 6 week intervals, the dose may be reduce to 20 mg/m2/day for 
five consecutive days in 6 week cycles, at the discretion of the treating physician.   After 
two cycles of five consecut ive days of treatment, if the patient meets the definition of CR 
with complete cytogenetic response as defined in Section 9 .0, administration  may further 
be decrease d to three  consecutive days per cycle  at the discretion of the  treating physician . 
 
It will  be a logistical goal of this trial consistently to return preliminary exome results to 
the treating physician by [CONTACT_42334] 1 and validated results by [CONTACT_42334] 2. 
However, this logistical goal is not a primary or secondary aim of this study.  Given the 
limited data regarding mutation presence and drug response, we do not anticipate that the 
results will directly influence therapeutic decisions made by [CONTACT_1963]. 
However, the development of comprehensive genomic pi[INVESTIGATOR_295751] a clinical trial setting will be required before personalized medicine can be

Amendment 4 Version date: 04/16/15   Page 26 of 51 6.0 DOSE MODIFICATIONS  
 
A criterion for discontinuation of the study is a delay of > 8 weeks between any two cycles.  
 
6.1 Delay for Cytopenia or Infection  
 
As cytopenias are a defining feature of AML and MDS, their presence alone do es not 
generally warrant dose modifications or delays. Patients will receive four cycles of therapy 
without adjustment for any cytopenia.  Following Cycle 4, dose modifications or delays for 
cytopenias will be made at the discretion of the investigator .  
 
Patients with febrile neutropenia (temperature ≥ 38.5° with ANC < 1,000/ l) or systemic 
infections should have treatment held until clinical resolution of the infection.  
 
6.2 Delay for Organ Dysfunction  
 
If ren al dysfunction (creatinine ≥ 3  X institutional up per limit of normal) or hepatic 
dysfunction ( bilirubin ≥ 2.5  mg/dl or ALT/AST ≥ 3 X institutional upper limit of normal)  
occurs, therapy may not resume until the abnormalities have resolved to below the limits 
stated above. If renal or hepatic dysfunction occurs during  a treatment course, the next dose 
of decitabine should be held, and serum chemistries should be checked twice per week.  
Decitabine can be resumed at full dose when creatinine, bilirubin, ALT and AST are below 
the limits listed above.  
 
For g rade 3 -4 non -hematologic toxicities  related to decitabine , decitabine treatment should 
be delayed until recovery to baseline or to grade ≤ 1. Decitabine may be reintroduced with 
a 50% dose reduction, or at full dose at the discretion of the investigator.  
 
6.3 Modification in Dose or Schedule  for Treatment Response  
 
Once AML patients achieve morphologic complete remission with incomplete blood count 
recovery (CRi)  or MDS patients achieve a marrow complete response (Marrow CR) as 
defined in Section 9 .0, decitabin e administration may be decreased to 20 mg/m2/day for 
ten consecutive days, and the cycles may be administered every 6 weeks  to limit 
myelosuppressive toxicity , at the discretion of the  treating physician. After two cycles at 
six week intervals, the dose m ay be reduced to 20 mg/m2/day for five consecutive days of 
treatment  in six week intervals . If the patient meets the definition of CR with complete 
cytogenetic response as defined in Section 9 .0, administration  may further be decrease d to 
three  consecutiv e days per cycle  at the discretion of the  treating physician .

Amendment 4 Version date: 04/16/[ADDRESS_360748] by [CONTACT_295804], a major mechanism for gene expression. In some cancer cells, 
hypermethylation  blocks the activity of tumor suppressor genes, which regulate cell 
division and differentiation to prevent malignant transformation. When suppressor gene 
activity is blocked, cell division becomes unregulated, leading to the formation of 
neoplastic cells.  Decitabine regulates DNA methylation (specifically targets the 
methyltransferase , DNMT1 ), effectively demethylating and reactivating different tumor 
suppressor genes. Because hypermethylation occurs early in the malignant transformation 
of cells, decitabi ne may have activity in chemoprevention. Other possible mechanisms for 
decitabine activity include cytotoxicity due to incorporation into DNA similar to other 
antimetabolites, methylation -independent induction of gene expression, and degradation of 
DNA met hyltransferase 1.

A secondary  endpoint of this study is to estimate morphologic complete remission rate.  
  
9.1 Response Criteria  - AML  
 
AML Patients will be assessed for response according to the IWG criteria:1  
 
Morphologic complete remission  (CR)  – Defined as morphologic leukemia -free state, 
defined as less than 5% blasts in aspi[INVESTIGATOR_295740] a count of ≥200 
nucleated cells and no blasts with Auer rods or any persis tence of extramedullary disease. 
When erythroid precursors cons titute less than 50% of bone marrow nucleated cells, the 
percentage of blasts is based on all nucleated cells; when there are 50% or more erythroid 
cells, the percentage blasts should be based on the nonerythroid cells. The presence of mild 
megaloblastoid changes may be permitted if they are thought to be consistent with 
treatment effect. However, persistence of pretreatment abnormalities (eg, pseudo -Pelger -
Hüet cells, ringed sideroblasts, dysplastic megakaryocytes) are not consistent with CR.   In 
addition,  ANC >1000/μl and platelet count of ≥100,000/μl. Patient must be independent of 
transfusions. No duration requirement for this designation.  
 
Cytogenetic complete remission (CCR) – Defined as morphologic complete remission plus 
a reversion to a normal karyo type. For this study, reversion of a normal karyotype is 
defined as no clonal abnormalities detected in a minimum of 20 mitotic cells.  
 
Morphologic complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery  (CRi)  – Defined as 
morphologic complete recovery with the exception of neutropenia <1000/μl or 
thrombocytopenia <100,000/μl.  
 
Partial remission  (PR) – Defined as meeting the above criteria for complete remission, 
with the following exceptions: decrease of ≥50% in the percentage of blast to 5 -25% in the 
bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337]. A value of 5% blasts in bone marrow with Auer rods present may 
also be considered a partial remission.  
 
Stable Disease (SD) – Defined as not meeting th e definitions of CR, CRi, PR, PD , or 
recurrence/morphologic relapse.   
 
Progressive disease  (PD) – Defined as a clear increase in bone marrow blast count, 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] a greater than 50% increase compared with baseline , or new extramedullary 
disease . Patients with a > 50% increase in peripheral blast count with an increase of the 
total perip heral white blood cell count to > 10,000/ l should undergo evaluation by [CONTACT_295793] .  
 
Recurrence/morphologic relapse  - Defined as relapse following complete remission is 
defined as reappearance of blasts in the blood or the finding of ≥5% blasts in the bone 
marrow, not attributable to any other cause. New dysplastic changes is considered relapse. 
Genomic Predictors of  Decitabine Response in AML/MDS  
 
Amendment 4 Version date: 04/16/15   Page 30 of 51 If there are no blasts in the peripher al blood and 5 -20% blasts in the bone marrow, bone 
marrow biopsy should be repeated in > 1 week to confirm relapse.

CR but will be noted.  
 
Marro w Complete Response ( Marrow CR) – Defined as < 5% myeloblasts in the bone 
marrow and a decrease by > 50% from pretreatment values, but not meeting the definition 
of CR above.  
 
Partial Remission ( PR) – Defined as meeting the definition of CR above with a d ecrease 
of myeloeblasts in the bone marrow by > 50% from pretreatment values, but absolute 
myeloblasts still >5%.  
 
Stable Disease (SD) – Defined as not meeting the definitions of CR, Marrow CR, PR, SD, 
PD, or recurrence/morphologic relapse.   
 
Progressive  Disease//Relapse  (PD) – Defined as ≥ 50% increase in blasts to > 5% blasts 
(for patients with less than 5% blasts at baseline only), ≥ 50% increase to > 10% blasts (for 
patients with 5 -10% blasts at baseline only), ≥ 50% increase to > 20% blasts (for pati ents 
with l0 -20% blasts at baseline only), ≥ 50% increase to > 30% blasts (for patients with 20 -
30% blasts at baseline only) or any of the following: At least 50% decrement from

at WU, any BJH or SLCH institution, or that impacts participants or the conduct of 
the study.  
 Noncompliance with federal regulations or the requirements or determinations of 
the IRB.  
 Receipt of new information that may impact the willingness of participants to 
participate or continue participation in the research study.  
 
These events must be reported to the IRB within 10 working days  of the occurrence of the 
event or notification to the PI [CONTACT_12581].   The death of a research participant that qualifies 
as a reportable event should be reported within 1 working day  of the occurrence of the 
event or notification to the PI [CONTACT_12581].  
 
10.7 Reporting Requirements for Secondary Sites  
 
The research team at each secondary site is required to promptly notify the Washington 
University PI [INVESTIGATOR_205137] (as described in Section 7.6) 
within 1 working day  of the o ccurrence of the event or notification of the secondary site’s 
PI [CONTACT_12581].  This notification may take place via email if there is not yet enough 
information for a formal written report (using either an FDA MedWatch form if required 
or an institutiona l SAE reporting form if not).  A formal written report must be sent to the 
Washington University PI [INVESTIGATOR_205935] 10 working days  of the 
occurrence of the event or notification of the secondary site’s PI [CONTACT_12581].  The death 
of a rese arch participant that qualifies as a reportable event should be reported within 1

Amendment 4 Version date: 04/16/15   Page 35 of 51 The research team at a secondary site is responsible for following its si te’s guidelines for 
reporting applicable events to its site’s IRB according to its own institutional guidelines.  
 
10.8 Reporting to Secondary Sites  
 
The Washington University PI (or designee) will notify the research team at each secondary 
site of all reportabl e events that have occurred at other sites (as described in Section 7.6) 
within [ADDRESS_360754] of the study will comply with all FDA safety reporting requirements.  
PLEASE NOTE THAT REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR THE FDA DIFFER 
FROM REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR HRPO/QASMC.  It is the 
responsibility of the investigator to report any unanticipated problem to the FDA as 
follows:  
 
 Report any unexpected fatal or life -threatening adverse experiences associated with 
use of the drug (i.e., there is a reasonable possibility that the experience may have 
been caused by [CONTACT_33641]) by [CONTACT_68002] [ADDRESS_360755] (in the view of the 
inves tigator) at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred, i.e., it does 
not include a reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused 
death.  
 Report any serious, unexpected adverse experiences, as well as results from ani mal 
studies that suggest significant clinical risk within 15 calendar days  after initial 
receipt of this information.  A serious adverse drug experience  is defined as any 
adverse drug experience occurring at any dose that results in any of the following 
outcomes:  
o Death  
o A life -threatening adverse drug experience  
o Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
o A persistent or significant disability/incapacity (i.e., a substantial disruption 
of a person’s ability to conduct normal life fu nctions)  
o A congenital anomaly/birth defect  
o Any other experience which, based upon appropriate medical judgment, 
may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention 
to prevent one of the outcomes listed above  
An unexpected adverse drug experience  is defined as any adverse drug experience, 
the specificity or severity of which is not consistent with the current investigator 
brochure (or risk information, if an IB is not required or available).

14.1 Analysis Populations  
 
Intent -to-Treat  - The intent -to-treat (ITT) population will be defined as all patients wh o 
receive at least one dose of decitabine .  
 
Efficacy -Evaluable  - The efficacy -evaluable (EE) population will be defined as all patients 
who receive at least one cycle  of treatment.   
 
Safety  - The safety population will be defined as all pati ents with at least one dose of 
decitabine . 
 
14.2 Statistical Analysis  
 
14.2.1  Descriptive Analyses  
 
Patient Disposition : The number of patients discontinued, the reasons for 
discontinuation, and the number of cycles administered will be summarized.  
 
Demographics and Baseline Characteristics : Descriptive summary statistics will 
be provided for demographic and important baseline characteristics.  For 
continuous variables, the number of patients,  mean, standard deviation, median, 
minimum and maximum will be provided.  For categorical variables, the number 
and percent of patients in each demographic/characteristic category will be 
summarized.  
 
14.2.2  Primary Endpoint Analysis  
 
The primary end -point of thi s phase II study is the correlation biomarkers with 
overall response in AML/MDS patients to decitabine.  
 
We will correlate the presence of patient specific mutations  (especially mutations  
in DNMT3A, IDH1, IDH2, and TET2 ) with overall response rates. Mutation rates 
in these genes and in other patient -specific genes will be correlated with overall 
response and t heir respective 95% confidence intervals will be provided.  
 
Statistical considerations. The relationship between AML/MDS -associated 
mutations an d the responsiveness to decitabine will be described by [CONTACT_295797] -square test or Fisher’s exact test as appropriate. The 
differentially expressed genes between responders and non -responders will be 
determined using the signi ficance analysis of microarray (SAM). Multivariate 
logistic regression will also be fit to adjust the potential confounding effects of other 
demographic and clinical characteristics. The resultant critical P values will be 
corrected for multiple testing.  Since the Bonferroni correction is known to be too 
conservative, a permutation analysis (e.g., 10,000 random assignments for 
Genomic Predictors of  Decitabine Response in AML/MDS  
 
Amendment 4 Version date: 04/16/15   Page 41 of 51 responsive status) will be used to derive an empi[INVESTIGATOR_295745] P value.  The new 
critical p -value is the number of permutation tes ts which yield a lower p -value than 
the original test divided by [CONTACT_295798]. [61]   
 
A power analysis was performed using Chi -square test for the association between 
mutation and response to decitabine. The frequency of DNMT3A, IDH1/2, and 
TET2 mutations in AML and MDS patients are each between 15% and 30% in 
multiple cohorts. [29-37] Table 3  shows the minimal detectable differences of 
response rates between mutant and wild -type cases, assuming an expected overall 
45% CR/CRi rate and 80% power. For an average of 20% frequency of a mutated 
gene, for example, 100 patients will provide 80% power to detect 30% difference 
at a [ADDRESS_360761] 
30% of clinical response 
could be attributed to the 
presence of a specific 
mutation. However, we 
anticipate that more power 
could be achieved as we 
assess patient groups with 
combined characteristics (e.g. 
DNMT3A mutation or loss of 
DNMT3A expression). In 
addition, we expect that the 
majority of the enrolled 125 
patients can be used in the analysis (since all of our molecular information will be 
acquired within 30 days of enrollment, we anticipate a drop -out rate of 20% or less).  
 
14.2.3  Secondary Endpoint Analyses  
 
The overall response rate (CR/CRi/PR) and complete response rate (CR/CRi) will 
be compared with historical controls [2], and the 95% confidence intervals will be 
provided.  
 
The rate of patient spe cific mutation clearance after 10, 28, and 56 days of therapy 
will be determined using an Illumina bas ed platform. We will compare the rate of 
mutation clearance between the patients who achieve a CR/CRi after 4 cycles and 
those who do not.  We anticipate that we will identify between 6 and 25 exonic 
SNVs per case (the range obtained with >200 AML samples s equenced to date with 
whole genome or exome sequencing), and that the expected 95% confidence 
interval of the mean variant allele frequency will be ±2.56% and ±1.25%, Table 3 . Detectable mutation associated response rates  (80% power, α = 0.05)

Amendment 4 Version date: 04/16/[ADDRESS_360762] deviation of 3.2% within the 
same clon e. The change of tumor burden over time and its association with clinical 
response will  be assessed using [ADDRESS_360763] ANOVA for repeated measurement data, 
followed by [CONTACT_295799] -hoc multiple comparisons for between -group differences (e.g., 
responders vs. non -respon ders) at given time points as well as the between -time 
differences within each group. The resultant critical P values will also be corrected 
using permutation analysis for multiple testing.  
 
 
The percent decrease in bone marrow  methylcytosine  will be calculated on day 
10±1. We will compare this reduction with previously published data and between 
the patients who achieve CR/CRi and those who do not.  The correlation of peak 
plasma  levels of decitabine with response will be assessed using [ADDRESS_360764] ANOVA 
for repeat ed measurement data, followed by [CONTACT_295799] -hoc multiple comparisons for 
between -group differences (e.g., responders vs. non -responders) and between -time 
differences. Similar analyses will be performed for the correlation of expression 
profiles and SNP analysi s with pharmacokinetic data.   
 
Statistical power justification.   A power analysis was performed using two -sample 
t-test for between -group difference and paired t -test for the change over time. For 
tumor clearance, this will provide > 99% power to detect a  10% difference in the 
means at two separate time points for clones with 6 or more variants, and > 98% 
power to detect a 15% difference if there are 3 or more variants per clone with α = 
0.05 (power will decrease to 91% and 82%, respectively, in cases wher e the 
standard deviation is 4.7%, the maximum we have observe d thus far). For 
pharmacologic correlations, we anticipate 85% power to determine a 25 ng/ml 
difference between the average C max of 45 evaluable responders and 55 evaluable 
non-responders with an  anticipated average C max of 70 ng/ml and a standard 
deviation of 40 ng/ml within the entire cohort, and with α = 0.05. [22] We believe a 
less significant difference would not be sufficient to warrant application in  clinical 
decision making (i.e. whether to continue therapy for more than 1 cycle). We 
anticipate 99% power to determine a difference of 20% in the reduction of bone 
marrow methylcytosine between [ADDRESS_360765] deviation of 15% and α = 0.05. [28, 66-68] 
The difference in methylcytosine reduction previously observed was 30% between 
patients achieving CR/PR and those with only hematologic improvement. [28]  
 
Time to relapse and time to death will also be listed for each patient.

Study Schema:  
 
 
Patients with  progressive disease after two cycles ( defined as a clear increase in bone marrow blast count, typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] a 
> 50% increase in bone marrow blasts over baseline ) should be removed from study . 
Patients with stable disease may conti nue on study and should under go a diagnostic bone marrow biopsy at the end 
of even numbered cycles.  
Once AML patients achieve morphologic complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi) or MDS 
patients achieve a marrow complete response (Marrow CR) as defined in Section 9.0, decitabine 
administration may be decreased to 20 mg/m2/day for ten consecutive days every 6 weeks, to limit 
myelosuppressive toxicity  and improve count recovery . After 2 cycles at 6 week intervals, the dose may be 
reduce to 20 mg/m2/day for five conse cutive days  in 6 week cycles, at the discretion of the treating physcian.  
After two cycles of five consecutive days of treatment, if the patient meets the definition of CR with complete 
cytogenetic response as defined in Section 9 .0, administration may further be decreased to three  consecutive 
days per cycle  at the discretion of the  treating physician.  
Sample collection for correlative studies:  
Bone marrow biopsies should be performed at baseline , at Cycle 1 Day 10 ± 1 , and at Day 28  ± 4 of Cycles 
1, 2, 4, and 6 . Following Cycle 6, bone marrow biopsies should be performed at the discretion of the 
treating physician to assess for relapse or progression.  
Peripheral blood sample s should be co llected on Day 4± 1 of Cycle 1.  Collection should be obtained 45 ± 
15 minutes after decitabine infusion is initiated.20

specific mutations, expression profiles, or pharmacogenomics) influence treatment 
algorithms, and 2) once therapy is initiated, in vivo  responsiveness is used to guide further 
therapy. The modern era of genomics has provided significant insights into cancer 
pathogenesis by [CONTACT_295778], as well as defining 
disease -specific patterns of gene expressio n. However, the application and integration of 
this data with therapeutics remains a difficult task.  
 
Decitabine is a commonly used single -agent therapy for patients with acute myeloid 
leukemia ( AML ) and/or myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ). Historically, it has yielded 
clinical complete responses in approximately 25% of patients across diverse clinical trials, 
it is well tolerated, and it can be given as in the outpatient  setting . However, the majority 
of patients do not respond to decitabine, the molecular e tiology of decitabine sensitivity is 
unknown, and there are no algorithms to predict patient responsiveness a priori or even 
within one month of starting therapy.   
 
AML and MDS are two closely related hematological disorder s characterized by 
[CONTACT_295807].  Both AML 
and MDS frequently occur  in elderly patients and some cases are secondary and/or related 
to long -term bone marrow damage after radiation or chemotherapy. Current therapy for 
AML consist s of cytotoxic chemotherapy followed by [CONTACT_295780]. Using these approaches, current cure rates may be as high as 60% for 
patients younger than 60 with good risk cytogenetics (e.g. t(15;17 ), t(8;21), inv(16)) .[4]  
Outcomes in patients ≥ 60 years old and with relapsed disease remain poor with 2 year 
survival of only ~25%. [5] Historically, t he available treatment for MDS has been 
symptomatic and has not been shown to be effective in producing sustained improvement 
in hematopoiesis or in delaying leukemic evolution [6, 7] .  
 
Current  AML therapy is poorly tolerated in elderly and pre -treated patients due to  
hematologic and non -hematologic toxicities; following such therapy, patients typi[INVESTIGATOR_295756] e 3-4 weeks of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_295733] . Even among the relatively healthy patients enrolled in clinical trials, induction 
mortality in the elderly can be as high as 20 -40% following standard inductio n therapy ,[8-
11] and moderate to severe non -hematologic toxicity occurs in at least an additional 30% 
of patients. [9, 12 -14] Consequently, many o lder AML patients are not offered traditional 
intensive chemotherapy, but receive supportive care alone. [15]  More effective and less 
toxic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_295734] a significant proportion of 
elder ly AML in population s. 
 
Decitabine has been studied in  MDS patients and in  elderly  and/or relapsed  AML patients . 
It has been found to be reasonably well tolerated, can be given in the  outpatient  setting , 
and has overall response rates of 20 -45%.[2, 3, 16 -20] Our own experience has been of 
Genomic Predictors of Decitabine Response in AML/MDS  
 
Amendment 3 Version date: 11/13/14   Page 8 of 50 CR/PR rates of 25% , [2] and this is typi[INVESTIGATOR_295735] (reviewed in [21]  Decitabin e is an S -phase depended drug.  [22 -24] However, 
decitabine is usually administered  in one hour daily infusions  during 3  to 5 consecutive 
days (too short to expose decitabine to most AM L blasts  during at least 2 cycles of 
replication , which divide every 2  to 7 days). [25-27]  Recent experience with increasing the 
number of infusion s per cycle from 5 consecutive days to 10 consecutive days has 
improved overall response rates to 67%. [3] Response to decitabine can be slow, sometimes 
requiring 3 to 5 cycles before maximum response is observed. [2] As a c onsequence, many 
patients are exposed to prolonged therapy, gaining little benefit, before determining 
resistance. There are currently no biomarkers that predict response to decitabine.  
 
Decitabine is a cytosine analogue that cannot be methylated. Incorpor ation of decitabine 
into DNA prevents DNA methylation at cytosine residues and derepresses epi[INVESTIGATOR_295736]. Therefore, the reduction in total genomic DNA methylcytosine 
content acts as a marker of effective decitabine dosing. Indeed , two groups have recently 
correlated effective methylcytosine reduction and gene expression derepression to 
response  (Figure 1.1) .[3, 28] 
 
  
   
Figure 1.1. From Shen et al JCO (2010) 28:611 and Blum et al JCO (2007) 25: [ADDRESS_360793] recently  used whole genome sequencing to identify  recurrent, somatic 
mutations in AML and MDS patients in four genes that are involved in methylcytosine 
regulation: DNMT3A, IDH1, IDH2, and TET2. [29-37] Collectively, nearly half of all 
AML/MDS patients have a mutation in one of these four genes.  DNMT3A mutations are 
associated with an adverse outcome in AML patients trea ted with cytotoxic 
chemotherapy. [35, 38] However, it is not yet clear whether the presence of mutations in 
one or more of these genes is associated with respo nse or resistance to decitabine.  
 
In this study, we will treat patients with the current state -of-the-art decitabine schedule. [3] 
We will perform exome sequencing on all patients and correlate response with mutation 
status, rate of mutat ion clearance , expression profile, plasma  decitabine levels , and DNA

Amendment 3 Version date: 11/13/[ADDRESS_360794] share d mutations in many of the same genes , 
shared patterns of mutation acquisition, and shared patterns of mutation evolution .[39, 40] 
Furthermore, MDS, like AML, presents  with clonal hematopoiesis, even when the 
morphologic blast count is zero. [36]Because this study will identify and track the rate of 
clearance of patient specific mutations, and because decitab ine has been shown to have 
efficacy in both AML and MDS patients,  [2, 3, 16 -19, 41 -45] combining analysis of AML 
and MDS patients is reasonable.   Asymptomatic MDS patients are excluded because these 
patients are typi[INVESTIGATOR_295737] -waitin g rather than with chemotherapy.  
  
1.2 Decitabine  and Hypomethylating agents in AML /MDS  
 
Methylation of cytosine in the CpG dinucleotide by [CONTACT_295808] a 
significant mechanism for the loss of tumor suppressor gene expression in human cancer, 
including AML  and MDS .[46, 47] Like azacitidine , decitabine  (5-aza-2’-deoxycitidine) is 
incorporated into DNA during S phase and forms covalent adducts with DNA 
methyltransferase. The irreversible inhibition of this enzyme results in loss of methylation 
and is associated  with differentiation. [48]  Decitabine is an approximately [ADDRESS_360795]  at higher doses  (1-2 µM) .[49]  
 
Decitabine has been investigated in hematologic malignancies using a range of doses and 
schedules.  It is currently FDA approved for the treatment of adults with MDS at a dose of 
15 mg/m2 every 8 hours for 3 days, based on a Phase III study that demonstrated improved 
outcomes in the treatment arm compared to patients treated with supportive care alone. [15]  
However, the overall response rate  in this trial w as modest ( 17%). Of note, 18% of the 
patients in th is trial had 20 -30% bone marrow blasts, meeting the current WHO criteria for 
AML.  Subsequent p hase I and II studies in AML, using a variety of low -dose decitabine 
regimens, have reporte d overall response rates of 22 -49%.[2, 3, 16 -19, 41 -45] Comparisons 
of multiple low dose schedules have noted improved efficacy in the MDS population using 
a dose of 20 mg/m2 on Days 1 -5 of a 28 -day cycle. [50, 51 ] Because of th ese results, we 
have recently explored this dosing schedule in the treatment of elderly patients with 
AML. [52] In this study, we observe d an overall response rate of 24 %, and an additional  
44% of patients achiev ed stable disease during a median of 5 monthly cycles. [48] In this 
study, we noted that decitabine  does not act quickly and the median time to response was 
3 months. These results are similar to the recently published experience in [LOCATION_013] 
treating 227 patients with 15 mg/m2 over 3 hours TID for 3 days every 6 weeks, which 
resulted in a CR/PR rate of 26%. [16]

Amendment 3 Version date: 11/13/14   Page 10 of 50 A recent study using a prolonged administration schedule (20 mg/m2 IV over 1 hour  on 
consecutive days 1 -10) showed improved  response (64 % CR/PR) and improved time to

In general, decitabine  is well tolerated. Unlike conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy, 
decitabine  can be administered in the outpatient setting. However, AML  and MDS are  
aggressive hematologic malignanc ies. Cy topenias commonly result from AML /MDS  
inhibition of normal hematopoiesis , and often do not resolve until a complete response is 
achieved. Thus, neutropenic sepsis and thrombocytopenic bleeding remain significant  
problems regardless  of therapy, especially during the first 4 -8 weeks. In our experience 
treating elderly AML patients, neutropenia occurred in 24%, sepsis in 9% , and bacteremia 
in 7%.  Similar results have been observed in MDS patients. [20, 53, 54 ] As a result, death 
is not uncommon in the first 8 weeks of therapy, occurring in 15 -17% of patients, and most 
commonly resulting from infection  and cytope nias related to disease and the rapy.[16, 52, 
55] While unsettling, these numbers are better than many historical patients  treated with 
cytotoxic chemotherapy , and suggest a need for continued improve ments in therapy .[9, 12]

1.2.1 Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism of Decitabine  
 
In human subjects , after IV administration, decitabine displayed a distribution phase 
with a half -life of 7 minutes and a terminal phase elimination half -life of 10-35 
minutes as measured by [CONTACT_295783]. [56, 57]   The short plasma half -life is d ue to rapid 
inactivation of decitabine by [CONTACT_295784]. [23] Total 
body clearance (Cl p) in humans was high with a mean value of 126 mL/min/kg. [58]  
 
Among five adult patients with advanced solid tumors administered seven courses 
of 100 mg/m2 of decitabine by 1 -hour infusions, [56] maximum plasma 
concentration ranged from [ADDRESS_360799] infusion 
and a slower decline over the next two hours to 6 nM, the level of detectability. 
Plasma half -life (mean SE) was estimated to be appro ximately 7 1 minutes in the 
initial phase (t ½α) and 355 minutes in the second phase (t ½β). The area under the 
plasma concentration -time curve was 408 88 ng.hour/mL for these patients, with a 
peak plasma concentration of 2.01 0.44 µM (0.440.1 µg/mL), while mean volume 
of distribution (Vd ss) and CLp was 4.59 1.42 L/kg and 126 21 mL/min/kg, 
respectively. The time course of DAC concentrations was similar in 1 of 2 patients 
administered 75 mg/m2, while DAC was usually undetectable in the plasma of 
patients  administered 25 to 60 mg/m2. 
 
Using a longer infusion time (up to 40 hours), Rivard et al. [57] reported a plasma 
concentration of 0.1 to 0.4 g/mL. With in fusion times of 40 -60 hours, at an infusion 
rate of 1 mg/kg/h, plasma concentrations of 0.43 -0.76 µg/mL were achieved. [59]  The 
steady -state plasma concentration at an infusion rate of 1  mg/kg/h was estimated to 
be 0.2 -0.5 µg/mL . The half -life after discontinuing the infusion was 12 -20 min.[57]  
 
Urinary excretion of unchanged decitabine was low, ranging from less than 0.01% to 
0.9% of the total dose, and there was no relationship between excretion and dose or 
plasma drug levels. High clearance values and a total urinary excretion of <1% of the 
administered dose suggest that decitabine is eliminated rapi[INVESTIGATOR_295738], including extrahepatic metabolism. [60] 
 
The steady state plasma concentrations (C ss) ranged from 0.31 to 0.39 µg/mL (1.27 
to 1.60 µM) during the infusion of 100 mg/m² decitabine over a 6 -hour period. [61] 
The range of concentrations during a 600 mg/m2 infusion over an 8 -hour period  was 
0.41-16 g/mL (1.68 to 4.76 µM). [60] These plasma concentrations are in the same 
range as the in vitro concentrations that activated the expression of tumor 
suppressor  gene p16 in three human non -small -cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell 
lines. [61]  
 
Steady state decitabine levels of 0.1  to 0.2 µM were achieved in solid tumor patients 
dosed with 30 mg/m²/day and 40 mg/m²/day by [CONTACT_108660] 72 hours. [62]

In our experience  treating primary patient blasts in vitro , concentrations of 100 – 
500 nM are required maximize methylcytosine  reduction without causing cellular 
toxicity. Because decitabine incorporation into DNA is S -phase dependent, 
exposure of cells during cell division is necessary for efficacy.  
  
 
 
 
1.2.2 Experience with  extended dosing schedules  
 
Blum et al recently published their experience treating  elderly AML patients with 
a 10-day course of decitabine 20 mg/m2/day as a 1 -hour infusion .[3] This prolonged 
exposure course was designed to increase the number of AML blast divisions 
exposed to decitabine per cycle. Toxicities were very similar to a  similar regiment 
given as a 3 and 5 day course ,[2, 16]  but the overal l response (CR/PR) was much 
improved (64% vs 25%). In all three  studies, the toxicities were primarily myeloid 
suppression and the resultant infectious and bleeding complications associated with 
leukemic and pharmacologic hematopoietic suppression. Furthermore, Blum et al 
noted that the perce nt methylcytosine reduction was improved (22% vs 11%) as 

Genomic Predictors of Decitabine Response in AML/MDS  
 
Amendment 3 Version date: 11/13/[ADDRESS_360800] clearance (50% of patients who ultimately achieved a CR had 
≤ 5% bone marrow blasts after 1 cycle vs 0% of patients after 2 cycles). Finally, 
like Shen et al, they observed a co rrelation between the extent of methylcytosine 
reduction and response. [28]  This study suggests that improvement in response 
rates and time to response can be achieved by [CONTACT_295785]. Further, that DNA methylcytosine r eduction can be achieved with 
prolonged exposure to decitabine and that this might be a patient -specific biological 
marker of adequate  dosing.  
  
Scandura et al. recently published a study of infusional decitabine prior to 
cytarabine + daunorubicin inductio n therapy for AML. [64] They escalated the 
duration of infusional therapy and reached their planned goal of 20 mg/m2/day x 7 
days of continuous therapy given prior to cytarabine and daunorubicin. They noted 
similar toxicities (primarily hematopoietic and the associated neutropenic 
infections) , but that these were not different from their experience giving cytarabine 
+ daunorubicin alone.  
 
1.3 Correlative Studies  
 
With exception of the peripheral blood sample coll ected on Cycle 1 Day 4, all correlative 
studies will be collected under  HRPO# 201011766 (“Tissue Acquisition for Analysis of 
Genetic Progression Factors in Hematologic Diseases ”) that all patients will be 
concurrently enrolled in.  The goals of the correlat ive studies include:  
 
1. To correlate p atient -specific mutations  with response to decitabine . 
We will perform exome sequencing of each patient’s pre-study  bone marrow sample 
and skin sample. We will determine AML/MDS -associated variants found in the bone 
marrow, but not skin sample. We will correlate the presence of mutations with response 
(especially mutations in DNMT3A,  IDH1, IDH2, and TET2 ). This study i s powered to 
identify mutations with >80% sensitivity to predict decitabine response if used as a 
clinical assay.  
 
2. To correlate the v elocity and depth of response  with response to decitabine . 
We will assess tumor burden by [CONTACT_295786] -speci fic mutations in bone 
marrow samp les collected pre study , Cycle 1 Day 10±1, Cycle 1 Day 28±4 , and Cycle 
2 Day 28 ±4. We will assess mutations in at least 24 recurrently mutated genes 
(including, but not limited to: FLT3, DNMT3A, NPM1, TET2, WT1, IDH1, IDH2,  
RUNX1, NRAS, TP53, U2AF1, KRAS, PHF6, MSTP9, PTPN11, KIT, SMC3, PRUNE2, 
ETV6, CEBPA, SMC1A, ASXL1, STAG2, RAD21 ) as well as all patient -specific 
mutations discovered during exome sequencing. The leukemic allele frequency will be 
measured using the Illumni a MySeq or HiSeq platform using DNA capture by [CONTACT_295787] -oligonucleotides. Patient bone marrow samples will be assessed 
pre-study , Cycle 1 D ay 10 ± 1 , Cycle 1 D ay 28 ± 4 , and Cycle 2 D ay 28 ± [ADDRESS_360801] es (normal control). The velocity of response 
will be calculated as the natural log rate of patient -specific mutation allele frequency 
clearance. Depth of response will be defined as the lowest patient -specific mutation 
Genomic Predictors of Decitabine Response in AML/MDS  
 
Amendment 3 Version date: 11/13/14   Page 14 of 50 allele frequency in a bone marrow sa mple. The velocity and depth of tumor response 
will be correlated to:  
 Achievement of clinical CR,  
 Time to best response,  
 Mutational status,  
 Time to disease progression.  
Because all patient -specific exome -discovered mutations will be assessed a second 
time in the primary bone marrow sample as well as the  Cycle 1 Day 10 ± 1, Cycle 1 
Day 28 ± 4, and Cycle 2 Day 28  ± 4 bone marrow samples, t his study will also serve 
to validate all exome -discovered mutations. This is important, because exome 
sequencing is asso ciated with a 20 -50% false -discovery rate depending on type I error 
tolerated  (mutation -calling algorithms are typi[INVESTIGATOR_295757]) .  Thus, many mutations discovered during exome sequencing are incorrect.  
This second ana lysis of these mutations will server to exclude these false positive calls.  
 
3. To correlate the bone marrow e xpression profile  from pre -study  and Cycle 1 Day 10 ± 
1 with response to decitabine . 
We will correlate expression signatures, and changes in expressi on signatures, with : 
 Achievement of clinical CR,  
 Mutation status . 
 
4. To correlate steady -state plasma decitabine concentration on Cycle 1  Day 4 ± 1 with:  
 Achievement of CR.  
 
5. To correlate the extent of b one marrow DNA hypomethylation  on Cycle 1 Day 10 ± 1 
with response to decitabine . 
We will assess the percent reduction in bone marrow methylcytosine content using LC -
MS. Patients will be evaluated pre-study  and Cycle 1 Day 10 ± 1. The change in DNA 
methylcytosine content will be correlated to:  
 Achi evement of clinical CR,  
 Change in expression signature . 
This will determine whether inadequate blast exposure to decitabine correlates with 
drug resistance.

Amendment 3 Version date: 11/13/[ADDRESS_360810] for the treatment of FAB -M3 acute 
promyelocytic leukemia. AML patients who are < [ADDRESS_360811] not received 
cytotoxic induction chemotherapy are also excluded , because cytotoxic therapy offers a 
curative poss ibility for these patients.  MDS patients without cytopenias are also excluded 
because these patients can be followed with watchful -waiting . 
 
All patients will undergo bone marrow biopsies pre-study,  on Cycle 1  Day 10 ± 1, and on 
Day 28 ± [ADDRESS_360812] es on Cycle 1 Day 4 ± 1 for pharmacokinetic studies.  See Section 8.0 for details  
on correlative studies .  
 
Patients will receive decitabine 20 mg/m2/day as a 1 -hour infusion on consecutive Days 1 -
10 in 28 -day cycles.   The dose will be calculated based on a ctual patient weight at the 
beginning of each cycle.  
 
Once AML patients achieve morphologic complete remission with incomplete blood count 
recovery (CRi)  or MDS patients achieve a marrow complete response (Marrow CR) as 
defined in Section 9 .0, decitabine administration may be decreased to 20 mg/m2/day for 
ten consecutive days every 6 weeks,  to limit myelosuppressive toxicity  and improve count 
recovery . After 2 cycles at 6 week intervals, the dose may be reduce to 20 mg/m2/day for 
five consecutive days in 6  week cycles, at the discretion of the treating physician.   After 
two cycles of five consecutive days of treatment, if the patient meets the definition of CR 
with complete cytogenetic response as defined in Section 9 .0, administration  may further 
be decrea sed to three  consecutive days per cycle  at the discretion of the  treating physician . 
 
It will be a logistical goal of this trial consistently to return preliminary exome results to 
the treating physician by [CONTACT_42334] 1 and validated results by [CONTACT_42334] 2. 
However, this logistical goal is not a primary or secondary aim of this study. Given the 
limited data regarding mutation presence and drug response, we do not anticipate that the 
results will directly inf luence therapeutic decisions made by [CONTACT_1963]. 
However, the development of comprehensive genomic pi[INVESTIGATOR_295739] a clinical trial setting will be required before personalized medicine can be 
realized.

Amendment 3 Version date: 11/13/14   Page 25 of 50 6.0 DOSE MODIFICATIONS  
 
A criterion for discontinuation of the study is a delay of > 8 weeks between any two cycles.  
 
6.1 Delay for Cytopenia or Infection  
 
As cytopenias  are a defining feature of AML and MDS, their presence alone does not 
generally warrant dose modifications or delays. Patients will receive four cycles of therapy 
without adjustment for any cytopenia.  Following Cycle 4, dose modifications or delays for 
cytopenias will be made at the discretion of the investigator .  
 
Patients with febrile neutropenia (temperature ≥ 38.5° with ANC < 1,000/ l) or systemic 
infections should have treatment held until clinical resolution of the infection.  
 
6.2 Delay for Organ Dysfun ction  
 
If ren al dysfunction (creatinine ≥ 3  X institutional upper limit of normal) or hepatic 
dysfunction ( bilirubin ≥ 2.5  mg/dl or ALT/AST ≥ 3 X institutional upper limit of normal)  
occurs, therapy may not resume until the abnormalities have resolved to b elow the limits 
stated above. If renal or hepatic dysfunction occurs during  a treatment course, the next dose 
of decitabine should be held, and serum chemistries should be checked twice per week.  
Decitabine can be resumed at full dose when creatinine, bil irubin, ALT and AST are below 
the limits listed above.  
 
For grade 3 -4 non -hematologic toxicities  related to decitabine , decitabine treatment should 
be delayed until recovery to baseline or to grade ≤ 1. Decitabine may be reintroduced with 
a 50% dose reduc tion, or at full dose at the discretion of the investigator.  
 
6.3 Modification in Dose or Schedule  for Treatment Response  
 
Once AML patients achieve morphologic complete remission with incomplete blood count 
recovery (CRi)  or MDS patients achieve a marrow complete response (Marrow CR) as 
defined in Section 9 .0, decitabine administration may be decreased to 20 mg/m2/day for 
ten consecutive days, and the cycles may be administered every 6 weeks  to limit 
myelosuppressive  toxicity , at the discretion of the  treating physician. After two cycles at 
six week intervals, the dose may be reduced to 20 mg/m2/day for five consecutive days of 
treatment  in six week intervals . If the patient meets the definition of CR with complete 
cytogenetic response as defined in Section 9 .0, administration  may further be decrease d to 
three  consecutive days per cycle  at the discretion of the  treating physician .

Amendment 3 Version date: 11/13/[ADDRESS_360823] by [CONTACT_295804], a major mechanism f or gene expression. In some cancer cells, 
hypermethylation blocks the activity of tumor suppressor genes, which regulate cell 
division and differentiation to prevent malignant transformation. When suppressor gene 
activity is blocked, cell division becomes unregulated, leading to the formation of 
neoplastic cells. Decitabine regulates DNA methylation (specifically targets the 
methyltransferase , DNMT1 ), effectively demethylating and reactivating different tumor 
suppressor genes. Because hypermethylation  occurs early in the malignant transformation 
of cells, decitabine may have activity in chemoprevention. Other possible mechanisms for 
decitabine activity include cytotoxicity due to incorporation into DNA similar to other 
antimetabolites, methylation -independent induction of gene expression, and degradation of 
DNA methyltransferase 1.

Amendment 3 Version date: 11/13/14   Page 28 of 50 9.0 EFFICACY, SAFETY AND CORRELATIVE STUDY MEASURES  
 
A secondary  endpoint of this study is to estimate morphologic complete remission rate.  
  
9.1 Response Criteria  - AML  
 
AML Patients will be assessed for response  according to the IWG criteria:1  
 
Morphologic complete remission  (CR)  – Defined as morphologic leukemia -free state, 
defined as less than 5% blasts in aspi[INVESTIGATOR_295740] a count of ≥200 
nucleated cells and no blasts with Auer rods or any per sistence of extramedullary disease. 
When erythroid precursors constitute less than 50% of bone marrow nucleated cells, the 
percentage of blasts is based on all nucleated cells; when there are 50% or more erythroid 
cells, the percentage blasts should be bas ed on the nonerythroid cells. The presence of mild 
megaloblastoid changes may be permitted if they are thought to be consistent with 
treatment effect. However, persistence of pretreatment abnormalities (eg, pseudo -Pelger -
Hüet cells, ringed sideroblasts, dy splastic megakaryocytes) are not consistent with CR.   In 
addition, ANC >1000/μl and platelet count of ≥100,000/μl. Patient must be independent of 
transfusions. No duration requirement for this designation.  
 
Cytogenetic complete remission (CCR) – Defined as  morphologic complete remission plus 
a reversion to a normal karyotype. For this study, reversion of a normal karyotype is 
defined as no clonal abnormalities detected in a minimum of 20 mitotic cells.  
 
Morphologic complete remission with incomplete blood c ount recovery  (CRi)  – Defined as 
morphologic complete recovery with the exception of neutropenia <1000/μl or 
thrombocytopenia <100,000/μl.  
 
Partial remission  (PR) – Defined as meeting the above criteria for complete remission, 
with the following exceptions: decrease of ≥50% in the percentage of blast to 5 -25% in the 
bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337]. A value of 5% blasts in bone marrow with Auer rods present may 
also be considered a partial remissi on.  
 
Stable Disease (SD) – Defined as not meeting th e definitions of CR, CRi, PR, PD , or 
recurrence/morphologic relapse.   
 
Progressive disease  (PD) – Defined as a clear increase in bone marrow blast count, 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] a greater than 50% increase compared w ith baseline , or new extramedullary 
disease . Patients with a > 50% increase in peripheral blast count with an increase of the 
total peripheral white blood cell count to > 10,000/ l should undergo evaluation by [CONTACT_295811] d isease .  
 
Recurrence/morphologic relapse  - Defined as relapse following complete remission is 
defined as reappearance of blasts in the blood or the finding of ≥5% blasts in the bone 
marrow, not attributable to any other cause. New dysplastic changes is considered relapse. 
Genomic Predictors of Decitabine Response in AML/MDS  
 
Amendment 3 Version date: 11/13/14   Page 29 of 50 If there are no blasts in the peripheral blood and 5 -20% blasts in the bone marrow, bone 
marrow biopsy should be repeated in > 1 week to confirm relapse.

x 109/L, Neutrophils > 1.0 x 109/L, and 0% blasts. Persistent dysplasia does not exclude 
CR but will be noted.  
 
Marrow Complete Response ( Marrow CR) – Defined as < 5% myeloblasts in the bone 
marrow and a decrease by > 50% from pretreatment values, but not meeting the definition 
of CR ab ove.  
 
Partial Remission ( PR) – Defined as meeting the definition of CR above with a decrease 
of myeloeblasts in the bone marrow by > 50% from pretreatment values, but absolute 
myeloblasts still >5%.  
 
Stable Disease (SD) – Defined as not meeting the definitions of CR, Marrow CR, PR, SD, 
PD, or recurrence/morphologic relapse.   
 
Progressive Disease//Relapse  (PD) – Defined as ≥ 50% increase in blasts to > 5% blasts 
(for patients with less than 5% blasts at baseline only), ≥ 50% increase to > 10% blasts (for 
patients with 5 -10% blasts at baseline only), ≥ 50% increase to > 20% blasts (for patients 
with l0 -20% blasts at baseline only), ≥ 50% increase to > 30% blasts (for patients with 20 -
30% blasts at baseline only) or any of the following:  At least 50% decrement from

14.1 Analysis Populations  
 
Intent -to-Treat  - The intent -to-treat (ITT) population will be defined as all patients wh o 
receive at least one dose of decitabine .  
 
Efficacy -Evaluable  - The efficacy -evaluable (EE) population will be defined as all patients 
who receive at least one cycle of treatment.   
 
Safety  - The safety population will be defined as all pati ents with at least one dose of 
decitabine . 
 
14.2 Statistical Analysis  
 
14.2.1  Descriptiv e Analyses  
 
Patient Disposition : The number of patients discontinued, the reasons for 
discontinuation, and the number of cycles administered will be summarized.  
 
Demographics and Baseline Characteristics : Descriptive summary statistics will 
be provided for  demographic and important baseline characteristics.  For 
continuous variables, the number of patients, mean, standard deviation, median, 
minimum and maximum will be provided.  For categorical variables, the number 
and percent of patients in each demograph ic/characteristic category will be 
summarized.  
 
14.2.2  Primary Endpoint Analysis  
 
The primary end -point of this phase II study is the correlation biomarkers with 
overall response in AML/MDS patients to decitabine.  
 
We will correlate the presence of patient specif ic mutations  (especially mutations  
in DNMT3A, IDH1, IDH2, and TET2 ) with overall response rates. Mutation rates 
in these genes and in other patient -specific genes will be correlated with overall 
response and t heir respective 95% confidence intervals will be provided.  
 
Statistical considerations. The relationship between AML/MDS -associated 
mutations and the responsiveness to decitabine  will be described by [CONTACT_295797] -square test or Fisher’s exact test as appropriate. The 
differentially expressed genes between responders and non -responders will be 
determined using the significance analysis of microarray (SA M). Multivariate 
logistic regression will also be fit to adjust the potential confounding effects of other 
demographic and clinical characteristics. The resultant critical P values will be 
corrected for multiple testing.  Since the Bonferroni correction is  known to be too 
conservative, a permutation analysis (e.g., 10,000 random assignments for 
Genomic Predictors of Decitabine Response in AML/MDS  
 
Amendment 3 Version date: 11/13/14   Page 40 of 50 responsive status) will be used to derive an empi[INVESTIGATOR_295745] P value.  The new 
critical p -value is the number of permutation tests which yield a lower p -value tha n 
the original test divided by [CONTACT_295798]. [61]   
 
A power analysis was performed using Chi -square test for the association between 
mutation and response to decitabine. The frequency of DNMT3A, IDH1/2, and 
TET2 mutations in AML and MDS patients a re each between 15% and 30% in 
multiple cohorts. [29-37] Table 3  shows the minimal detectable differences of 
response rates between mutant and wild -type cases, assuming an expected overall 
45% CR/CRi rate and 80% power. For an average of 20% frequency of a mutated 
gene, for example, 100 patients will provide 80% power to detect 30% difference 
at a [ADDRESS_360836] 
30% of clinical response 
could be attributed to the 
presence of a specific 
mutation. However, we 
anticipate that more power 
could be achieved as we 
assess patient groups with 
combined characteristics (e.g. 
DNMT3A mutation or loss of 
DNMT3A expression). In 
addition, we expect that the 
majority of the enrolled 125 
patients  can be used in the analysis (since all of our molecular information will be 
acquired within 30 days of enrollment, we anticipate a drop -out rate of 20% or less).  
 
14.2.3  Secondary Endpoint Analyses  
 
The overall response rate (CR/CRi/PR) and complete response rat e (CR/CRi) will 
be compared with historical controls [2], and  the 95% confidence intervals will be 
provided.  
 
The rate of patient spe cific mutation clearance after 10, 28, and 56 days of therapy 
will be determined using an Illumina based platform. We will compare the rate of 
mutation clearance between the patients w ho achieve a CR/CRi after 4 cycles and 
those who do not.  We anticipate that we will identify between 6 and 25 exonic 
SNVs per case (the range obtained with >200 AML samples sequenced to date with 
whole genome or exome sequencing), and that the expected 95%  confidence 
interval of the mean variant allele frequency will be ±2.56% and ±1.25%, Table 3 . Detectable mutation associated response rates  (80% power, α = 0.05)

Amendment 3 Version date: 11/13/[ADDRESS_360837] deviation of 3.2% within the 
same clone. The change of tumor burden over time and its association with clinical 
response  will  be assessed using [ADDRESS_360838] ANOVA for repeated measurement data, 
followed by [CONTACT_295799] -hoc multiple comparisons for between -group differences (e.g., 
responders vs. non -responders) at given time points as well as the between -time 
differences within each gro up. The resultant critical P values will also be corrected 
using permutation analysis for multiple testing.  
 
The steady -state plasma  decitabine concentration on day 4 ± 1 will be measured 
and correlated with clinical overall response.  
 
The percent decrease in bone marrow  methylcytosine will be calculated on day 
10±1. We will compare this reduction with previously published data and between 
the patients who achieve CR/CRi and those who do not.  The correlation of peak 
plasma  levels of deci tabine with response will be assessed using [ADDRESS_360839] ANOVA 
for repeated measurement data, followed by [CONTACT_295799] -hoc multiple comparisons for 
between -group differences (e.g., responders vs. non -responders) and between -time 
differences. Similar analyses will be performed for the correlation of expression 
profiles and SNP analysis with pharmacokinetic data.   
 
Statistical power justification.   A power analysis was performed using two -sample 
t-test for between -group difference and paired t -test for the change over time. For 
tumor cl earance, this will provide > 99% power to detect a 10% difference in the 
means at two separate time points for clones with 6 or more variants, and > 98% 
power to detect a 15% difference if there are 3 or more variants per clone with α = 
0.05 (power will de crease to 91% and 82%, respectively, in cases where the 
standard deviation is 4.7%, the maximum we have observe d thus far). For 
pharmacologic correlations, we anticipate 85% power to determine a 25 ng/ml 
difference between the average C max of 45 evaluable responders and 55 evaluable 
non-responders with an anticipated average C max of 70 ng/ml and a standard 
deviation of 40 ng/ml within the entire cohort, and with α = 0.05. [22] We believe a 
less significant difference would n ot be sufficient to warrant application in clinical 
decision making (i.e. whether to continue therapy for more than 1 cycle). We 
anticipate 99% power to determine a difference of 20% in the reduction of bone 
marrow methylcytosine between [ADDRESS_360840] deviation of 15% and α = 0.05. [28, 66-68] 
The difference in methylcytosine reduction previously observed was 30% between 
patients achieving CR/PR and those  with only hematologic improvement. [28]  
 
Time to relapse and time to death will also be listed for each patient.

Study Schema:  
 
 
Patients with p rogressive disease after two cycles ( defined as a clear increase in bone marrow blast count, typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] a 
> 50% increase in bone marrow blasts over baseline ) should be removed from study . 
Patients with stable disease may conti nue on study and should undergo a diagnost ic bone marrow biopsy at the end 
of even numbered cycles.  
Once AML patients achieve morphologic complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi) or MDS 
patients achieve a marrow complete response (Marrow CR) as defined in Section 9 .0, decitabi ne 
administration may be decreased to 20 mg/m2/day for ten consecutive days every 6 weeks, to limit 
myelosuppressive toxicity  and improve count recovery . After 2 cycles at 6 week intervals, the dose may be 
reduce to 20 mg/m2/day for five consecutive days  in 6 week cycles, at the discretion of the treating 
physcian.  After two cycles of five consecutive days of treatment, if the patient meets the definition of CR 
with complete cytogenetic response as defined in Section 9 .0, administration may further be decreased to 
three  consecutive days per cycle  at the discretion of the  treating physician.  
Sample collection for correlative studies:  
Bone marrow biopsies should be performed at baseline , at Cycle 1 Day 10 ± 1 , and at Day 28  ± 4 of Cycles 
1, 2, 4, and 6 . Following Cycle 6, bone marrow biopsies should be performed at the discretion of the 
treating physician to assess for relapse or progression.  
Peripheral blood sample s should be co llected on Day 4± 1 of Cycle 1.  Collection should be obtained 45 ± 
15 minutes after decitabine infusion is initiated.20

Genomic Predictors of Decitabine Response in AML/MDS  
 
Amendment 2 Version date: 09/11/14   Page 7 of 51 1.0 INTRODUCTIO N 
 
1.1 Rational e   
 
Personalized therapy for cancer requires that 1 ) patient -specific factors (e.g. patient -
specific mutations, expression profiles, or pharmacogenomics) influence treatment 
algorithms, and 2) once therapy is initiated, in vivo  responsiveness is used to guide 
further therapy. The modern era of genomics has provided significant insights into cancer 
pathogenesis by [CONTACT_295778], as well as defining 
disease -specific patterns of gene expressio n. However, the application and integration of 
this data with therapeutics remains a difficult task.  
 
Decitabine is a commonly used single -agent therapy for patients with acute myeloid 
leukemia ( AML ) and/or myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ). Historically, it has yielded 
clinical complete responses in approximately 25% of patients across diverse clinical 
trials, it is well tolerated, and it can be given as in the outpatient  setting . However, the 
majority of patients do not respond to decitabine, the molecular e tiology of decitabine 
sensitivity is unknown, and there are no algorithms to predict patient responsiveness a 
priori or even within one month of starting therapy.  
 
AML and MDS are two closely related hematological disorder s characterized by 
[CONTACT_295812].  Both AML 
and MDS frequently occur  in elderly patients and some cases are secondary and/or 
related to long -term bone marrow damage after radiation or chemotherapy.  Current 
therapy for AML consists of cytotoxic chemotherapy followed by [CONTACT_295813]. Using these approaches, current cure rates 
may be as high as 60% for patients younger than 60 with good risk cytogenetics (e.g.  
t(15;17 ), t(8;21), inv(16)) .[4]  Outcomes in patients ≥ 60 year s old and with relapsed 
disease remain poor with 2 year survival of only ~25%. [5] Historically, t he available 
treatment f or MDS has been symptomatic and has not been shown to be effective in 
producing sustained improvement in hematopoiesis or in delaying leukemic evolution [6, 
7].  
 
Current  AML therapy is poorly tolerated in  elderly and pre -treated patients due to  
hematologic and non -hematologic toxicities; following such therapy, patients typi[INVESTIGATOR_295732] 3 -4 weeks of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_295733] . Even among the relatively  healthy patients enrolled in clinical trials, 
induction mortality in the elderly can be as high as 20 -40% following standard induction 
therapy ,[8-11] and moderate to severe non -hematologic toxicity occurs in at least an 
additional 30% of patients. [9, 12 -14] Consequently, many older AML patients are not 
offered traditional intensive chemotherapy, but receive supportive care alone. [15]  More

been of CR/PR rates of 25% , [2] and this is typi[INVESTIGATOR_295763] (reviewed in [21]  Decitabine is an S -phase depended drug.  [22 -24] 
However, decitabine is usually administered  in one hour daily infusions  during 3  to 5 
consecutive days  (too short to expose decitabine to most AM L blasts  during  at least 2 
cycles of replication , which divide every 2  to 7 days). [25-27]  Recent experience with 
increasing the number of infusion s per cycle from 5 consecutive days to 10 consecutive 
days has improved overall response rates to 67%. [3] Response to decitabine can be slow, 
sometimes requiring 3  to 5 cycles befo re maximum response is observed. [2] As a 
consequence, many p atients are exposed to prolonged therapy, gaining little benefit, 
before determining resistance. There are currently no biomarkers that predict response to 
decitabine.  
 
Decitabine is a cytosine analogue that cannot be methylated. Incorporation of decitabin e 
into DNA prevents DNA methylation at cytosine residues and derepresses epi[INVESTIGATOR_295736]. Therefore, the reduction in total genomic DNA methylcytosine 
content acts as a marker of effective decitabine dosing. Indeed, two groups have recently 
correlated effective methylcytosine reduction and gene expression derepression to 
response  (Figure 1.1) .[3, 28] 
 
  
   
Figure 1.1. From Shen et al JCO (2010) 28:611 and Blum et al JCO (2007) 25: 3884.  
 
We and others have recently  used whole genome sequencing to identify  recurrent, 
somatic mutations in AML and MDS patients in four gen es that are involved in 
methylcytosine regulation: DNMT3A, IDH1, IDH2, and TET2. [29-37] Collectively, 
nearly half of all AML/MDS patients have a mutation in one of these four genes.  
DNMT3A mutations are associated with an adverse outcome in AML patients treated with 
cytotoxic chemotherapy. [35, 38] However, it is not yet clear whether the presence of 
mutations in one or more of these genes is associated with response or res istance to 
decitabine.  
 
 
Genomic Predictors of Decitabine Response in AML/MDS  
 
Amendment 2 Version date: 09/11/14   Page 9 of 51 In th is study, we will treat patients with the current state -of-the-art decitabine 
schedule. [3] We will perform exome sequencing on all patients and correlate response 
with mutation status, rate of mutat ion clearance , expression profile, plasma  decitabine 
levels , and DNA methylcytosine content reduction. This approach will comprehensively 
assess genomic and pharmacologic parameters that could clinically predict p atient 
response to decitabine.  
 
In this study , we will combine analysis of patients with AML and MDS. Recent ge nomic 
analysis has shown that AML and MDS have share d mutations in many of the same 
genes , shared patterns of mutation acquisition, and shared patterns of mutation 
evolution .[39, 40] Furthermore, MDS, like AML, presents  with clonal hematopoiesis, 
even when the morphologic blast count is zero. [36]Because this study will identify and 
track the rate of clearance of patient specific mutations, and because decitabine has be en 
shown to have efficacy in both AML and MDS patients,  [2, 3, 16 -19, 41 -45] combining 
analysis of AML and MDS patients is reasonable.   Asymptomatic MDS patients are 
excluded because these patients are typi[INVESTIGATOR_295737] -waitin g rather than 
with chemotherapy.  
  
1.2 Decitabine  and Hypomethylating agents in AML /MDS  
 
Methylation of cytosine in the CpG dinucleotide by [CONTACT_295781] a 
significant mechanism for the loss of tumor suppressor gene expression in human cancer, 
including AML  and MDS .[46, 47] Like azacitidine , decitabine  (5-aza-2’-deoxycitidine) is 
incorporated into DNA during S phase and forms covalent adducts with DNA 
methyltransferase. The irreversible inhibition of this enzyme results in loss of 
methylation and is associated with differentiation. [48]  Decitabine is an approximately [ADDRESS_360868] at higher doses  (1-2 µM) .[49]  
 
Decitabine has been investigated in hematologic malignancies using a range of doses and 
schedules.  It is currently FDA approved for the treatment of adults with MDS at a dose 
of 15 mg/m2 every 8 hours for 3 days, based on a Phase III study that demonstrated 
improved outcomes in the treatment arm compared to patients treated with supportive 
care alone. [15]  However, the overall response rate  in this trial w as modest ( 17%). Of 
note, 18% o f the patients in th is trial had 20 -30% bone marrow blasts, meeting the 
current WHO criteria for AML.  Subsequent p hase I and II studies in AML, using a 
variety of low -dose decitabine regimens, have reporte d overall response rates of 22 -
49%.[2, 3, 16 -19, 41 -45] Comparisons of multiple low dose schedules have noted 
improved efficacy in the MDS population using a dose of 20 mg/m2 on Days 1 -5 of a 28 -
day cycle. [50, 51 ] Because of these results, we have recently explored this dosing 
schedule in the treatment of elderly patients with AML. [52] In this study, we observe d an 
overall response rate of 24 %, and an additional  44% of patients achiev ed stable disease 
during a median of 5 monthly cycles. [48] In this study, we noted that decitabine  does not

Amendment 2 Version date: 09/11/[ADDRESS_360869] quickly and the median time to response was 3 months. These results are similar to 
the recently published experience in [LOCATION_013] treating 227 patients with 15 mg/m2 over 3 
hours TID for 3 days every 6 weeks, which resulted in a CR/PR rate of 26%. [16]  
 
A recent study using a prolon ged administration schedule (20 mg/m2 IV over 1 hour on 
consecutive days 1 -10) showed improved  response (64 % CR/PR) and improved time to 
respond (50% of patients had bone marrow blasts < 5% after 1 cycle of therapy). [3]  
These results are an improvement over previous experience by [CONTACT_295814], and this

In general, decitabine  is well tolerated. Unlike conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy, 
decitabine  can be administered in the outpatient setting. However, AML  and MDS are  
aggressive hematologic malignanc ies. Cy topenias commonly result from AML /MDS  
inhibition of normal hematopoiesis , and often do not resolve until a complete response is 
achieved. Thus, neutropenic sepsis and thrombocytopenic bleeding remain significant  
problems regardless  of therapy, especially during the first 4 -8 weeks. In our experience 
treating elderl y AML patients, neutropenia occurred in 24%, sepsis in 9% , and 
bacteremia in 7%.  Similar results have been observed in MDS patients. [20, 53, 54 ] As a

patients, and most commonly resulting from infection  and cytope nias related to disease 
and the rapy.[16, 52, 55 ] While unsettling, these numbers are better than many historical 
patients  treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy , and suggest a need for continued 
improve ments in therapy .[9, 12]   
 
1.2.1 Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism of Decitabine  
 
In human subjects , after IV administration, decitabine displayed a distribution 
phase with a half -life of 7 minutes and a terminal phase elimination half -life of 10-
35 minutes as measured by [CONTACT_295783]. [56, 57]   The short plasma half -life is d ue to 
rapid inactivation of decitabine by [CONTACT_295784]. [23] 
Total bo dy clearance (Cl p) in humans was high with a mean value of 126 
mL/min/kg. [58]  
 
Among five adult patients with advanced solid tum ors administered seven courses 
of 100 mg/m2 of decitabine by 1 -hour infusions, [56] maximum plasma 
concentration ranged from [ADDRESS_360874] infusion 
and a slower decline over the next two hours to 6 nM, the level of detectability. 
Plasma half -life (mean SE) was estimated to be approximately 7 1 minutes in 
the initial phase (t ½α) and 355 minutes in the second pha se (t ½β). The area under 
the plasma concentration -time curve was 408 88 ng.hour/mL for these patients, 
with a peak plasma concentration of 2.01 0.44 µM (0.44 0.1 µg/mL), while mean 
volume of distribution (Vd ss) and CLp was 4.59 1.42 L/kg and 126 21 
mL/min/kg, respectively. The time course of DAC concentrations was similar in 1 
of 2 patients administered 75 mg/m2, while DAC was usually undetectable in the 
plasma of patients administered 25 to 60 mg/m2. 
 
Using a longer infusion time (up to 40 hours), R ivard et al. [57] reported a plasma 
concentration of 0.1 to 0.4 g/mL. With infusion times of 40 -60 hours, at an 
infusion rate of 1 mg/kg/h, plasma concentra tions of 0.43 -0.76 µg/mL were 
achieved. [59]  The steady -state plasma concentration at an infusion rate of 
1 mg/kg/h was estimated to be 0.2 -0.5 µg/mL. The half -life after discontinuing the 
infusion was 12 -20 min.[57]  
 
Urinary excretion of unchanged decitabine was low, ranging from less than 0.01% 
to 0.9% of the total dose, and there was no relationship between excretion and dose 
or plasma drug levels. High clearance values and a total urinary excretion of <1% 
of the administered dose suggest that decitabine is eliminated rapi[INVESTIGATOR_295738], including extrahepatic metabolism. [60] 
 
The steady state plasma concentrations (C ss) ranged from 0.31 to 0.39 µg/mL 
(1.27 to 1.60 µM) during the infusion of 100 mg/m² decitabine over a 6 -hour 
period. [61] The range of concentr ations during a 600 mg/m2 infusion over an 8 -
hour period  was 0.41 -16 g/mL (1.68 to 4.76 µM). [60] These plasma 
Genomic Predictors of Decitabine Response in AML/MDS  
 
Amendment 2 Version date: 09/11/14   Page 12 of 51 concentrations are in the same range as the in vitro concentrations that activated 
the expression of tumor suppressor gene p16 in three human non -small -cell lung 
cancer (NSCLC) cell lines. [61]  
 
Steady state decitabine levels of 0.1 to 0.2 µM were achieved in solid tumor 
patients dosed with 30 mg/m²/day an d 40 mg/m²/day by [CONTACT_295815] 72 hours. [62]  
 
Summary of published steady state serum levels are below and are in proportion to 
infusion rate  (R2 = 0.98, p < 0.0001) :[63]

In our experience  treating primary patient blasts in vitro , concentrations of 100 – 
500 nM are required maximize methylcytosine reduction without causing cellular 
toxicity. Because decitabine incorporation into DNA is S -phase dependent, 
exposure of cells during cell division is necessary for efficacy.  
  
 
 
 
1.2.2 Experience with  extended dosing schedules  
 
Blum et al recently published their experience treating  elderly AML patients with 
a 10 -day course of decitabine 20 mg/m2/day as a 1 -hour infusion .[3] This

Amendment 2 Version date: 09/11/[ADDRESS_360875] 
divisions exposed to decitabine per cycle. Toxicities were very similar to a  similar 
regiment give n as a 3 and 5 day course ,[2, 16]  but the overal l response (CR/PR) 
was much improved (64% vs 25%). In all three  studies, the toxicities were 
primarily myeloid suppression and the resultant infectious and bleeding 
complications associated with leukemic and pharmacologic hematopoietic 
suppression. Furthermore, Blum et al noted that the perce nt methylcytosine 
reduction was improved (22% vs 11%) as was the time to blast clearance (50% of 
patients who ultimately achieved a CR had ≤ 5% bone marrow blasts after 1 cycle 
vs 0% of patients after 2 cycles). Finally, like Shen et al , they observed a 
correlation between the extent of methylcytosine reduction and response. [28]  
This study suggests that improvement in response rates and time to response can 
be achieved by [CONTACT_295816]. Further, that DNA 
methylcytosine r eduction can be achieved with prolonged exposure to decitabine 
and that this might be a patient -specific biological marker of adequate  dosing.  
  
Scandura et al. recently published a study of infusional decitabine prior to 
cytarabine + daunorubicin inductio n therapy for AML. [64] They escalated the 
duration of infusional therapy and reached their planned goal of 20 mg/m2/day x 7 
days of continuous therapy given prior to cytarabine and daunorubicin. They 
noted similar toxicities (primarily hematopoietic and the associated neutropenic 
infections) , but that these were not different from their experience giving 
cytarabine + daunorubicin alone.  
 
1.3 Correlative Studies  
 
With exception of the peripheral blood sample collected on Cycle 1 Day 4, all correlative 
studies will be collected under  HRPO# 201011766 (“Tissue Acquisition for Analysis of 
Genetic Progression Factors in Hematologic Diseases ”) that all patients will be 
concurrently enrolled in.  The goals of the correlative studies include:  
 
1. To correlate p atient -specific mutations  with response to decitabine . 
We will perform exome sequencing of each patient’s pre-study  bone marrow sample 
and skin sample. We will determine AML/MDS -associated variants found in the bone 
marrow, but not skin sample. We will correlate the presence of mutations with 
response (especially mutations in DNMT3A,  IDH1, IDH2, and TET2 ). This study is 
powered to identify mutations with >80% sensitivity t o predict decitabine response if 
used as a clinical assay.  
 
2. To correlate the v elocity and depth of response  with response to decitabine . 
We will assess tumor burden by [CONTACT_295786] -specific mutations in bone 
marrow samp les collected pre study , Cycle 1 Day 10±1, Cycle 1 Day 28±4 , and 
Cycle 2 Day 28 ±4. We will assess mutations in at least 24 recurrently mutated genes 
(including, but not limited to: FLT3, DNMT3A, NPM1, TET2, WT1, IDH1, IDH2, 
RUNX1, NRAS, TP53, U2AF1, KRAS, PHF6, MSTP9, PTPN1 1, KIT, SMC3, 
PRUNE2, ETV6, CEBPA, SMC1A, ASXL1, STAG2, RAD21 ) as well as all patient -

Amendment 2 Version date: 09/11/14   Page 14 of 51 specific mutations discovered during exome sequencing. The leukemic allele 
frequency will be measured using the Illumnia MySeq or HiSeq platform using DNA 
capture by [CONTACT_295817] -oligonucleotides. Patient bone marrow samples 
will be assessed pre-study , Cycle 1 D ay 10 ± 1 , Cycle 1 D ay 28 ± 4 , and Cycle 2 D ay 
28 ± 4 and compared with patient specific skin samples (normal control). The 
velocity of response will be calculated as the natural log rate of patient -specific 
mutation allele frequency clearance. Depth of response will be defined as the lowest 
patient -specific mutation allele frequency in a bone marrow sample. The velocity and 
depth of tumor response will  be correlated to:  
 Achievement of clinical CR,  
 Time to best response,  
 Mutational status,  
 Time to disease progression.  
Because all patient -specific exome -discovered mutations will be assessed a second 
time in the primary bone marrow sample as well as the  Cycle 1 Day 10 ± 1, Cycle 1 
Day 28 ± 4, and Cycle 2 Day 28  ± 4 bone marrow samples, t his study will also serve 
to validate all exome -discovered mutations. This is important, because exome 
sequencing is associated with a 20 -50% false -discovery rate depending  on type I error 
tolerated  (mutation -calling algorithms are typi[INVESTIGATOR_295757]) .  Thus, many mutations discovered during exome sequencing are 
incorrect.  This second analysis of these mutations will server to exclude the se false 
positive calls.  
 
3. To correlate the bone marrow e xpression profile  from pre -study  and Cycle 1 Day 10 
± 1 with response to decitabine . 
We will correlate expression signatures, and changes in expression signatures, with : 
 Achievement of clinical CR,  
 Mutation status . 
 
4. To correlate steady -state plasma decitabine concentration on Cycle 1  Day 4 ± 1 with:  
 Achievement of CR.  
 
5. To correlate the extent of b one marrow DNA hypomethylation  on Cycle 1 Day 10 ± 1 
with response to decitabine . 
We will assess the percent reduction in bone marrow methylcytosine content using 
LC-MS. Patients will be evaluated pre-study  and Cycle 1 Day 10 ± 1. The change in 
DNA methylcytosine content will be correlated to:  
 Achievement of clinical CR,  
 Change in expre ssion signature . 
This will determine whether inadequate blast exposure to decitabine correlates with 
drug resistance.

CR) as defined in Section 9 .0, decitabine administration may be decreased to five 
consecutive days to limit myelosuppressive toxicity  at the discretion of the  treating 
physician. After two cycles of five consecutive days of treatment, if the patient meets the 
definition of CR with complete cytogen etic response as defined in Section 9 .0, 
administration  may further be decrease d to three  consecutive days per cycle  at the 
discretion of the  treating physician . 
 
It will be a logistical goal of this trial consistently to return preliminary exome results t o 
the treating physician by [CONTACT_42334] 1 and validated results by [CONTACT_42334] 2. 
However, this logistical goal is not a primary or secondary aim of this study. Given the 
limited data regarding mutation presence and drug response, we do not antic ipate that the 
results will directly influence therapeutic decisions made by [CONTACT_1963]. 
However, the development of comprehensive genomic pi[INVESTIGATOR_295739] a clinical trial setting will be required before personalized  medicine can be 
realized.

Genomic Predictors of Decitabine Response in AML/MDS  
 
Amendment 2 Version date: 09/11/14   Page 25 of 51 6.0 DOSE MODIFICATIONS  
 
A criterion for discontinuation of the study is a delay of > 8 weeks between any two 
cycles.  
 
6.1 Delay for Cytopenia or Infection  
 
As cytopenias are a defining feature of AML and MDS, their presence alone does not 
generally warrant dose modifications or delays. Patients will receive four cycles of 
therapy without adjustment for any cytopenia.  Following Cycle 4, dose modifications or 
delays for cytopenias will be made at the discretion of the investigator .  
 
Patients with febrile neutropenia (temperature ≥ 38.5° with ANC < 1,000/ l) or systemic 
infections should have treatment held until clinical resolution of the infection.  
 
6.2 Delay for Organ Dysfunction  
 
If ren al dysfunction (creatinine ≥ 3  X institutional upper limit of normal) or hepatic 
dysfunction ( bilirubin ≥ 2.5  mg/dl or ALT/AST ≥ 3 X institutional upper limit of normal)  
occurs, therapy may not resume until the abnormalities have resolved to below the limits 
stated above. If renal or hepatic dysfunction occurs during  a treatment course, the next 
dose of decitabine should be held, and serum chemistries should be checked twice per 
week.  Decitabine can be resumed at full dose when creatinine, bilirubin, ALT and AST 
are below the limits listed above.  
 
For grade 3 -4 non -hematologic toxicities  related to decitabine , decitabine treatment 
should be delayed until recovery to baseline or to grade ≤ 1. Decitabine may be 
reintroduced with a 50% dose reduction, or at full dose at the discretion of the 
investigator.  
 
6.3 Modification in Dose or Schedule  for Treatment Response  
 
Once AML patients achieve morphologic complete remission with incomplete blood 
count recovery (CRi)  or MDS patients achieve a marrow complete response (Marrow 
CR) as defined in Section 9 .0, decitabine administration may be decreased to 20 
mg/m2/day for ten consecutive days, and the cycles may be administered every 6 weeks  
to limit myelosuppressive toxicity , at the discretion of the  treating physician. After two 
cycles at six week intervals, the dose may be reduced to 20 mg/m2/day for five 
consecutive days of treatment  in six week intervals . If the patient meets the definition of 
CR with complete cyt ogenetic response as defined in Section 9 .0, administration  may 
further be decrease d to three  consecutive days per cycle  at the discretion of the  treating 
physician .

Amendment 2 Version date: 09/11/[ADDRESS_360896] by 
[CONTACT_295820], a major mechanism fo r gene expression. In some cancer 
cells, hypermethylation blocks the activity of tumor suppressor genes, which regulate cell 
division and differentiation to prevent malignant transformation. When suppressor gene 
activity is blocked, cell division becomes u nregulated, leading to the formation of 
neoplastic cells. Decitabine regulates DNA methylation (specifically targets the 
methyltransferase , DNMT1 ), effectively demethylating and reactivating different tumor 
suppressor genes. Because hypermethylation occurs  early in the malignant transformation 
of cells, decitabine may have activity in chemoprevention. Other possible mechanisms 
for decitabine activity include cytotoxicity due to incorporation into DNA similar to other 
antimetabolites, methylation -independent  induction of gene expression, and degradation 
of DNA methyltransferase 1.

Amendment 2 Version date: 09/11/14   Page 29 of 51 9.0 EFFICACY, SAFETY AND CORRELATIVE STUDY MEASURES  
 
A secondary  endpoint of this study is to estimate morphologic complete remission rate.  
  
9.1 Response Criteria  - AML  
 
AML Patients will be assessed for respon se according to the IWG criteria:1  
 
Morphologic complete remission  (CR)  – Defined as morphologic leukemia -free state, 
defined as less than 5% blasts in aspi[INVESTIGATOR_295740] a count of ≥200 
nucleated cells and no blasts with Auer rods or any persis tence of extramedullary disease. 
When erythroid precursors constitute less than 50% of bone marrow nucleated cells, the 
percentage of blasts is based on all nucleated cells; when there are 50% or more erythroid 
cells, the percentage blasts should be based on the nonerythroid cells. The presence of 
mild megaloblastoid changes may be permitted if they are thought to be consistent with 
treatment effect. However, persistence of pretreatment abnormalities (eg, pseudo -Pelger -
Hüet cells, ringed sideroblasts,  dysplastic megakaryocytes) are not consistent with CR.   
In addition, ANC >1000/μl and platelet count of ≥100,000/μl. Patient must be 
independent of transfusions. No duration requirement for this designation.  
 
Cytogenetic complete remission (CCR) – Defined  as morphologic complete remission 
plus a reversion to a normal karyotype. For this study, reversion of a normal karyotype is 
defined as no clonal abnormalities detected in a minimum of 20 mitotic cells.  
 
Morphologic complete remission with incomplete bloo d count recovery  (CRi)  – Defined 
as morphologic complete recovery with the exception of neutropenia <1000/μl or 
thrombocytopenia <100,000/μl.  
 
Partial remission  (PR) – Defined as meeting the above criteria for complete remission, 
with the following exceptions: decrease of ≥50% in the percentage of blast to 5 -25% in 
the bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337]. A value of 5% blasts in bone marrow with Auer rods present 
may also be considered a partial remissi on.  
 
Stable Disease (SD) – Defined as not meeting th e definitions of CR, CRi, PR, PD , or 
recurrence/morphologic relapse.   
 
Progressive disease  (PD) – Defined as a clear increase in bone marrow blast count, 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] a greater than 50% increase compared with baseline , or new extramedullary 
disease . Patients with a > 50% increase in peripheral blast count with an increase of the 
total peripheral white blood cell coun t to > 10,000/ l should undergo evaluation by [CONTACT_295793] .  
 
Recurrence/morphologic relapse  - Defined as relapse following complete remission is 
defined as reappearance of blasts in the blood or the finding of ≥5% b lasts in the bone 
marrow, not attributable to any other cause. New dysplastic changes is considered 
Genomic Predictors of Decitabine Response in AML/MDS  
 
Amendment 2 Version date: 09/11/14   Page 30 of 51 relapse. If there are no blasts in the peripheral blood and 5 -20% blasts in the bone 
marrow, bone marrow biopsy should be repeated in > 1 week to confirm re lapse.

exclude CR but will be noted.  
 
Marrow  Complete Response ( Marrow CR) – Defined as < 5% myeloblasts in the bone 
marrow and a decrease by > 50% from pretreatment values, but not meeting the 
definition of CR above.  
 
Partial Remission ( PR) – Defined as meeting the definition of CR above with a de crease 
of myeloeblasts in the bone marrow by > 50% from pretreatment values, but absolute 
myeloblasts still >5%.  
 
Stable Disease (SD) – Defined as not meeting the definitions of CR, Marrow CR, PR, 
SD, PD, or recurrence/morphologic relapse.   
 
Progressive Disease//Relapse  (PD) – Defined as ≥ 50% increase in blasts to > 5% blasts 
(for patients with less than 5% blasts at baseline only), ≥ 50% increase to > 10% blasts 
(for patients with 5 -10% blasts at baseline only), ≥ 50% increase to > 20% blasts (for 
patie nts with l0 -20% blasts at baseline only), ≥ 50% increase to > 30% blasts (for patients 
with 20 -30% blasts at baseline only) or any of the following: At least 50% decrement 
from maximum remission/response in granulocytes or platelets, reduction in Hgb by ≥ 2

14.1 Analysis Populations  
 
Intent -to-Treat  - The intent -to-treat (ITT) population will be defined as all patients wh o 
receive at least one dose of decitabine .  
 
Efficacy -Evaluable  - The efficacy -evaluable (EE) population will be defined as all 
patients who receive at least one cycle of treatment.   
 
Safety  - The safety population will be defined as all pati ents with at least one dose of 
decitabine . 
 
14.2 Statistical Analysis  
 
14.2.1  Descriptive Analyses  
 
Patient Disposition : The number of patients discontinued, the reasons for 
discontinuat ion, and the number of cycles administered will be summarized.  
 
Demographics and Baseline Characteristics : Descriptive summary statistics will 
be provided for demographic and important baseline characteristics.  For 
continuous variables, the number of pati ents, mean, standard deviation, median, 
minimum and maximum will be provided.  For categorical variables, the number 
and percent of patients in each demographic/characteristic category will be 
summarized.  
 
14.2.2  Primary Endpoint Analysis  
 
The primary end -point o f this phase II study is the correlation biomarkers with 
overall response in AML/MDS patients to decitabine.  
 
We will correlate the presence of patient specific mutations  (especially mutations  
in DNMT3A, IDH1, IDH2, and TET2 ) with overall response rates. Mutation rates 
in these genes and in other patient -specific genes will be correlated with overall 
response and t heir respective 95% confidence intervals will be provided.  
 
Statistical considerations. The relationship between AML/MDS -associated 
mutations and the responsiveness to decitabine will be described by [CONTACT_295797] -square test or Fisher’s exact test as appropriate. The 
differentially expressed genes between responde rs and non -responders will be 
determined using the significance analysis of microarray (SAM). Multivariate 
logistic regression will also be fit to adjust the potential confounding effects of 
other demographic and clinical characteristics. The resultant cri tical P values will 
be corrected for multiple testing.  Since the Bonferroni correction is known to be 
too conservative, a permutation analysis (e.g., 10,000 random assignments for 
Genomic Predictors of Decitabine Response in AML/MDS  
 
Amendment 2 Version date: 09/11/14   Page 41 of 51 responsive status) will be used to derive an empi[INVESTIGATOR_295745] P value.  T he new 
critical p -value is the number of permutation tests which yield a lower p -value 
than the original test divided by [CONTACT_295798]. [61]   
 
A power analysis was performed using Chi -square test for the association 
between mutation and response to decitabine. The frequency of DNMT3A, 
IDH1/2, and TET2 mutations in AML and MDS patients are each between 15% 
and 30% in multiple cohorts. [29-37] Table 3  shows the minimal detectable 
differences of response rates between mutant and wild -type cases, assuming an 
expected overall 45% CR/CRi rate and 80% power. For an average of 20% 
frequency of a mutated gene, for example, 100 patients will provide 80% power 
to detect 30% difference at a [ADDRESS_360909] 30% of clinical 
response could be attributed 
to the presence of a specific 
mutation. However, we 
anticipate that more power 
could be achieved as we 
assess patient groups with 
combined characteristics 
(e.g. DNMT3A mutation or 
loss of DNMT 3A 
expression). In addition, we 
expect that the majority of the enrolled 125 patients can be used in the analysis 
(since all of our molecular information will be acquired within 30 days of 
enrollment, we anticipate a drop -out rate of 20% or less).  
 
14.2.3  Seconda ry Endpoint Analyses  
 
The overall response rate (CR/CRi/PR) and complete response rate (CR/CRi) will 
be compared with historical controls [2], and the 95% confidence intervals will be 
provided.  
 
The rate of patient spe cific mutation clearance after 10, 28, and 56 days of therapy 
will be determined using an Illumina based platform. We will compare the rate of 
mutation clearance between the patients who achieve a CR/CRi after 4 cycles and 
those who do not.  We anticipate that we will identify between 6 and 25 exonic 
SNVs p er case (the range obtained with >200 AML samples sequenced to date 
with whole genome or exome sequencing), and that the expected 95% confidence Table 3 . Detectable mutation associated response rates  (80% power, α = 0.05)

Amendment 2 Version date: 09/11/14   Page 42 of 51 interval of the mean variant allele frequency will be ±2.56% and ±1.25%, 
respectively, if we assume an anticipa ted standard deviation of 3.2% within the 
same clone. The change of tumor burden over time and its association with 
clinical response will  be assessed using [ADDRESS_360910] ANOVA for repeated 
measurement data, followed by [CONTACT_295799] -hoc multiple comparisons for between -
group differences (e.g., responders vs. non -responders) at given time points as 
well as the between -time differences within each group. The resultant critical P 
values will also be corrected using permutation analysis for multiple testing.  
 
The steady -state plasma  decitabine concentration on day 4 ± 1 will be measured 
and correlated with clinical overall response.  
 
The percent decrease in bone marrow  methylcytosine will be calculated on day 
10±1. We will compare this reduction with previously  published data and between 
the patients who achieve CR/CRi and those who do not.  The correlation of peak 
plasma  levels of decitabine with response will be assessed using [ADDRESS_360911] 
ANOVA for repeated measurement data, followed by [CONTACT_295799] -hoc multiple 
comparisons for between -group differences (e.g., responders vs. non -responders) 
and between -time differences. Similar analyses will be performed for the 
correlation of expression profiles and SNP analysis with pharmacokinetic data.   
 
Statistical power justification.   A power analy sis was performed using two -
sample t -test for between -group difference and paired t -test for the change over 
time. For tumor clearance, this will provide > 99% power to detect a 10% 
difference in the means at two separate time points for clones with 6 or m ore 
variants, and > 98% power to detect a 15% difference if there are 3 or more 
variants per clone with α = 0.05 (power will decrease to 91% and 82%, 
respectively, in cases where the standard deviation is 4.7%, the maximum we 
have observe d thus far). For p harmacologic correlations, we anticipate 85% 
power to determine a 25 ng/ml difference between the average C max of 45 
evaluable responders and 55 evaluable non -responders with an anticipated 
average C max of 70 ng/ml and a standard deviation of 40 ng/ml with in the entire 
cohort, and with α = 0.05. [22] We believe a less significant difference would not 
be sufficient to warrant application in clinical decision making (i.e. whether to 
continue therapy for more than 1 cycle). We anticipate 99% power to determine a 
difference of 20% in the reduction of bone  marrow methylcytosine between [ADDRESS_360912] 
deviation of 15% and α = 0.05. [28, 66-68] The difference in methylcytosine 
reduction previously observed wa s 30% between patients achieving CR/PR and 
those with only hematologic improvement. [28]  
 
Time to relapse and time to death will also be listed for each patient.

Amendment 2 Version date: 03/10/14  
 Study Schema:  
 
 
Patients with p rogressive disease after two cycles ( defined as a clear increase in bone marrow blast count, typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] a 
> 50% increase in bone marrow blasts over baseline ) should be removed from study . 
Patients with stable disease may conti nue on study and should undergo a diagnostic bone marrow biopsy at the end 
of even numbered cycles.  
Once AML patients achieve morphologic complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi) or MDS 
patients ac hieve a marrow complete response (Marrow CR) as defined in Section 9 .0, decitabine 
administration may be decreased to five consecutive days to limit myelosuppressive toxicity at the 
discretion of the  treating physician. After two cycles of five consecutive days of treatment, if the patient 
meets the definition of CR with complete cytogenetic response as defined in Section 9 .0, administration 
may further be decreased to three  consecutive days per cycle  at the discretion of the  treating physician.  
Sample collection for correlative studies:  
Bone marrow biopsies should be performed at baseline , at Cycle 1 Day 10 ± 1 , and at Day 28  ± 4 of Cycles 
1, 2, 4, and 6 . Following Cycle 6, bone marrow biopsies should be performed at the discretion of the 
treating physician to assess for relapse or progression.  
Peripher al blood sample s should be co llected on Day 4± 1 of Cycle 1.  Collection should be obtained 45 ± 
15 minutes after decitabine infusion is initiated.20

Genomic Predictors of Decitabine Response in AML/MDS  
 
Amendment 2 Version date: 03/10/14  
 1.0 INTRODUCTIO N 
 
1.1 Rational e   
 
Personalized therapy for cancer requires that 1) patient -specific factors (e.g. patient -
specific mutations, expression profiles, or pharmacogenomics) influence treatment 
algorithms, and 2) once therapy is initiated, in vivo  responsiveness is used to guide 
further therapy. The modern era of genomics has provided significant insights into cancer 
pathogenesis by [CONTACT_295778], as well as defining 
disease -specific patterns of gene expressio n. However, the application and integration of 
this data with therapeutics remains a difficult task.  
 
Decitabine is a commonly used single -agent therapy for patients with acute myeloid 
leukemia ( AML ) and/or myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ). Historically, it has yielded 
clinical complete responses in approximately 25% of patients across diverse clinical 
trials, it is well tolerated, and it can be given as in the outpatient  setting . However, the 
majority of patients do not respond to decitabine, the molecular e tiology of decitabine 
sensitivity is unknown, and there are no algorithms to predict patient responsiveness a 
priori or even within one month of starting therapy.  
 
AML and MDS are two closely related hematological disorder s characterized by 
[CONTACT_295807].  Both AML 
and MDS frequently occur  in elderly patients and some cases are secondary and/or 
related to long -term bone marrow damage after radiation or chemotherapy. Current 
therapy for AML consist s of cytotoxic chemotherapy followed by [CONTACT_295813]. Using these approaches, current cure rates 
may be as high as 60% for patients younger than 60 with good risk cytogenetics (e.g. 
t(15;17 ), t(8;21), inv(16)) .[4]  Outcomes in patients ≥ 60 years old and with relapsed 
disease remain poor with 2 year survival of only ~25%. [5] Historically, t he available 
treatment for MDS has been symptomatic and has not been shown to be effective in 
producing sustained improvement in hematopoiesis or in delaying leukemic evolution [6, 
7].  
 
Current  AML therapy is poorly tolerated in  elderly and pre -treated patients due to  
hematologic and non -hematologic toxicities; following such therapy, patients typi[INVESTIGATOR_295732] 3 -4 weeks of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_295733] . Even among the relatively  healthy patients enrolled in clinical trials, 
induction mortality in the elderly can be as high as 20 -40% following standard induction 
therapy ,[8-11] and moderate to severe non -hematologic toxicity occurs in at least an 
additional 30% of patients. [9, 12 -14] Consequently, many older AML patients are not 
offered traditional intensive chemotherapy, but receive supportive care alone. [15]  More 
effective and less toxic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_295734] a significant 
proportion of elder ly AML in population s. 
 
Decitabine  has been studied in  MDS patients and in  elderly  and/or relapsed  AML 
patients . It has been found to be reasonably well tolerated, can be given in the  outpatient

been of CR/PR rates of 25% , [2] and this is typi[INVESTIGATOR_295763] (reviewed in [21]  Decitabine is an S -phase depended drug.  [22 -24] 
However, decitabine is usually administered  in one hour daily infusions  during 3  to 5 
consecutive days  (too short to expose decitabine to most AM L blasts  during  at least 2 
cycles of replication , which divide every 2  to 7 days). [25-27]  Recent experience with 
increasing the number of infusion s per cycle from 5 consecutive days to 10 consecutive 
days has improved overall response rates to 67%. [3] Response to decitabine can be slow, 
sometimes requiring 3  to 5 cycles befo re maximum response is observed. [2] As a 
consequence, many p atients are exposed to prolonged therapy, gaining little benefit, 
before determining resistance. There are currently no biomarkers that predict response to 
decitabine.  
 
Decitabine is a cytosine analogue that cannot be methylated. Incorporation of decitabin e 
into DNA prevents DNA methylation at cytosine residues and derepresses epi[INVESTIGATOR_295736]. Therefore, the reduction in total genomic DNA methylcytosine 
content acts as a marker of effective decitabine dosing. Indeed, two groups have recently 
correlated effective methylcytosine reduction and gene expression derepression to 
response  (Figure 1.1) .[3, 28]

We and others have recently  used whole genome sequencing to identify  recurrent, 
somatic mutations in AML and MDS patients in four gen es that are involved in 
methylcytosine regulation: DNMT3A, IDH1, IDH2, and TET2. [29-37] Collectively, 
nearly half of all AML/MDS patients have a mutation in one of these four genes.  
DNMT3A mutations are associated with an adverse outcome in AML patients treated with 
cytotoxic chemotherapy. [35, 38] However, it is not yet clear whether the presence of 
mutations in one or more of these genes is associated with response or res istance to 
decitabine.  
 
 
Genomic Predictors of Decitabine Response in AML/MDS  
 
Amendment 2 Version date: 03/10/14  
 In th is study, we will treat patients with the current state -of-the-art decitabine 
schedule. [3] We will perform exome sequencing on all patients and correlate response 
with mutation status, rate of mutat ion clearance , expression profile, plasma  decitabine 
levels , and DNA methylcytosine content reduction. This approach will comprehensively 
assess genomic and pharmacologic parameters that could clinically predict p atient 
response to decitabine.  
 
In this study , we will combine analysis of patients with AML and MDS. Recent genomic 
analysis has shown that AML and MDS have share d mutations in many of the same 
genes , shared patterns of mutation acquisition, and shared p atterns of mutation 
evolution .[39, 40] Furthermore, MDS, like AML, presents  with clonal hemat opoiesis, 
even when the morphologic blast count is zero. [36]Because this study will identify and 
track the rate of clearance of patient specific mutations, and because decitabine has been 
shown to have efficacy in both AML and MDS patients,  [2, 3, 16 -19, 41 -45] combining 
analysis of AML and MDS patients is reasonable.   Asymptomatic MDS patients are 
excluded because these patients are typi[INVESTIGATOR_295737] -waitin g rather than 
with chemotherapy.  
  
1.2 Decitabine  and Hypomethylating agents in AML /MDS  
 
Methylation of cytosine in the CpG dinucleotide by [CONTACT_295781] a 
signifi cant mechanism for the loss of tumor suppressor gene expression in human cancer, 
including AML  and MDS .[46, 47] Like azacitidine , decitabine  (5-aza-2’-deoxycitidine) is 
incorporated into DNA during S phase and forms covalent adducts with DNA 
methyltransferase. The irreversible inhibition of this enzyme results in loss of 
methylation and is associated with differentiation. [48]  Decitabine is an approximately [ADDRESS_360940] at higher doses  (1-2 µM) .[49]  
 
Decitabine has been investigated in hematologic malignancies using a range of doses and 
schedules.  It is currently FDA approved for the treatment of adults with MDS at a dose 
of 15 mg/m2 every 8 hours for 3 days, based on a Phase III study that demonstrated 
improved outcomes in the treatment arm compared to patients treated with supportive 
care alone. [15]  However, the overall response rate  in this trial w as modest ( 17%). Of 
note, 18% o f the patients in th is trial had 20 -30% bone marrow blasts, meeting the 
current WHO criteria for AML.  Subsequent p hase I and II studies in AML, using a 
variety of low -dose decitabine regimens, have reporte d overall response rates of 22 -
49%.[2, 3, 16 -19, 41 -45] Comparisons of multiple low dose schedules have noted 
improved efficacy in the MDS population using a dose of 20 mg/m2 on Days 1 -5 of a 28 -
day cycle. [50, 51 ] Because of these results, we have recently explored this dosing 
schedule in the treatment of elderly patients with AML. [52] In this study, we observe d an 
overall response rate of 24 %, and an additional  44% of patients achiev ed stable disease 
during a median of 5 monthly cycles. [48] In this study, we noted that decitabine  does not

Amendment 2 Version date: 03/10/[ADDRESS_360941] quickly and the median time to response was 3 months. These results are similar to 
the recently published experience in [LOCATION_013] treating 227 patients with 15 mg/m2 over 3 
hours TID for 3 days every 6 weeks, which resulted in a CR/PR rate of 26%. [16]  
 
A recent study using a prolon ged administration schedule (20 mg/m2 IV over 1 hour on 
consecutive days 1 -10) showed improved  response (64 % CR/PR) and improved time to 
respond (50% of patients had bone marrow blasts < 5% after 1 cycle of therapy). [3]  
These results are an improvement over previous experience by [CONTACT_295814], and this

In general, decitabine  is well tolerated. Unlike conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy, 
decitabine  can be administered in the outpatient setting. However, AML  and MDS are  
aggressive hematologic malignanc ies. Cy topenias commonly result from AML /MDS  
inhibition of normal hematopoiesis , and often do not resolve until a complete response is 
achieved. Thus, neutropenic sepsis and thrombocytopenic bleeding remain significant  
problems regardless  of therapy, especially during the first 4 -8 weeks. In our experience 
treating elderl y AML patients, neutropenia occurred in 24%, sepsis in 9% , and 
bacteremia in 7%.  Similar results have been observed in MDS patients. [20, 53, 54 ] As a

patients, and most commonly resulting from infection  and cytope nias related to disease 
and the rapy.[16, 52, 55 ] While unsettling, these numbers are better than many historical 
patients  treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy , and suggest a need for continued 
improve ments in therapy .[9, 12]   
 
1.2.1 Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism of Decitabine  
 
In human subjects , after IV administration, decitabine displayed a distribution 
phase with a half -life of 7 minutes and a terminal phase elimination half -life of 10-
35 minutes as measured by [CONTACT_295783]. [56, 57]   The short plasma half -life is d ue to 
rapid inactivation of decitabine by [CONTACT_295784]. [23] 
Total bo dy clearance (Cl p) in humans was high with a mean value of 126 
mL/min/kg. [58]  
 
Among five adult patients with advanced solid tum ors administered seven courses 
of 100 mg/m2 of decitabine by 1 -hour infusions, [56] maximum plasma 
concentration ranged from [ADDRESS_360946] infusion 
and a slower decline over the next two hours to 6 nM, the level of detectability. 
Plasma half -life (mean SE) was estimated to be approximately 7 1 minutes in 
the initial phase (t ½α) and 355 minutes in the second pha se (t ½β). The area under 
the plasma concentration -time curve was 408 88 ng.hour/mL for these patients, 
with a peak plasma concentration of 2.01 0.44 µM (0.44 0.1 µg/mL), while mean 
volume of distribution (Vd ss) and CLp was 4.59 1.42 L/kg and 126 21 
mL/min/kg, respectively. The time course of DAC concentrations was similar in 1 
of 2 patients administered 75 mg/m2, while DAC was usually undetectable in the 
plasma of patients administered 25 to 60 mg/m2. 
 
Using a longer infusion time (up to 40 hours), R ivard et al. [57] reported a plasma 
concentration of 0.1 to 0.4 g/mL. With infusion times of 40 -60 hours, at an 
infusion rate of 1 mg/kg/h, plasma concentra tions of 0.43 -0.76 µg/mL were 
achieved. [59]  The steady -state plasma concentration at an infusion rate of 
1 mg/kg/h was estimated to be 0.2 -0.5 µg/mL. The half -life after discontinuing the 
infusion was 12 -20 min.[57]  
 
Urinary excretion of unchanged decitabine was low, ranging from less than 0.01% 
to 0.9% of the total dose, and there was no relationship between excretion and dose 
or plasma drug levels. High clearance values and a total urinary excretion of <1% 
of the administered dose suggest that decitabine is eliminated rapi[INVESTIGATOR_295738], including extrahepatic metabolism. [60] 
 
The steady state plasma concentrations (C ss) ranged from 0.31 to 0.39 µg/mL 
(1.27 to 1.60 µM) during the infusion of 100 mg/m² decitabine over a 6 -hour 
period. [61] The range of concentrations during a 600 mg/m2 infusion over an 8 -
hour period  was 0.41 -16 g/mL (1.68 to 4.76 µM). [60] These plasma 
Genomic Predictors of Decitabine Response in AML/MDS  
 
Amendment 2 Version date: 03/10/14  
 concentrations are in the same range as the in vitro concentrations that activated 
the expression of tumor suppressor gene p16 in three human non -small -cell lung 
cancer (NSCLC) cell lines. [61]  
 
Steady state decitabine levels of 0.1 to 0.2 µM were achieved in solid tumor 
patients  dosed with 30 mg/m²/day and 40 mg/m²/day by [CONTACT_295815] 72 hours. [62]  
 
Summary of published steady state serum levels are below and are in proportion to 
infusion rate  (R2 = 0.98, p < 0.0001) :[63]

In our experience  treating primary patient blasts in vitro , concentrations of 100 – 
500 nM are required maximize methylcytosine  reduction without causing cellular 
toxicity. Because decitabine incorporation into DNA is S -phase dependent, 
exposure of cells during cell division is necessary for efficacy.  
  
 
 
 
1.2.2 Experience with  extended dosing schedules  
 
Blum et al recently published their experience treating  elderly AML patients with 
a 10 -day course of decitabine 20 mg/m2/day as a 1 -hour infusion .[3] This

Amendment 2 Version date: 03/10/[ADDRESS_360947] 
divisions exposed to decitabine per cycle. Toxicities were very similar to a  similar 
regiment give n as a 3 and 5 day course ,[2, 16]  but the overal l response (CR/PR) 
was much improved (64% vs 25%). In all three  studies, the toxicities were 
primarily myeloid suppression and the resultant infectious and bleeding 
complications associated with leukemic and pharmacologic hematopoietic 
suppression. Furthermore, Blum et al noted that the perce nt methylcytosine 
reduction was improved (22% vs 11%) as was the time to blast clearance (50% of 
patients who ultimately achieved a CR had ≤ 5% bone marrow blasts after 1 cycle 
vs 0% of patients after 2 cycles). Finally, like Shen et al , they observed a 
correlation between the extent of methylcytosine reduction and response. [28]  
This study suggests that improvement in response rates and time to response can 
be achieved by [CONTACT_295816]. Further, that DNA 
methylcytosine r eduction can be achieved with prolonged exposure to decitabine 
and that this might be a patient -specific biological marker of adequate  dosing.  
  
Scandura et al. recently published a study of infusional decitabine prior to 
cytarabine + daunorubicin inductio n therapy for AML. [64] They escalated the 
duration of infusional therapy and reached their planned goal of 20 mg/m2/day x 7 
days of continuous therapy given prior to cytarabine and daunorubicin. They 
noted similar toxicities (primarily hematopoietic and the associated neutropenic 
infections) , but that these were not different from their experience giving 
cytarabine + daunorubicin alone.  
 
1.3 Correlative Studies  
 
With exception of the peripheral blood sample collected on Cycle 1 Day 4, all correlative 
studies will be collected under  HRPO# 201011766 (“Tissue Acquisition for Analysis of 
Genetic Progression Factors in Hematologic Diseases ”) that all patients will be 
concurrently enrolled in.  The goals of the correlative studies include:  
 
1. To correlate p atient -specific mutations  with response to decitabine . 
We will perform exome sequencing of each patient’s pre-study  bone marrow sample 
and skin sample. We will determine AML/MDS -associated variants found in the bone 
marrow, but not skin sample. We will correlate the presence of mutations with 
response (especially mutations in DNMT3A,  IDH1, IDH2, and TET2 ). This study is 
powered to identify mutations with >80% sensitivity t o predict decitabine response if 
used as a clinical assay.  
 
2. To correlate the v elocity and depth of response  with response to decitabine . 
We will assess tumor burden by [CONTACT_295786] -specific mutations in bone 
marrow samp les collected pre stud y, Cycle 1 Day 10±1, Cycle 1 Day 28±4 , and 
Cycle 2 Day 28 ±4. We will assess mutations in at least 24 recurrently mutated genes 
(including, but not limited to: FLT3, DNMT3A, NPM1, TET2, WT1, IDH1, IDH2, 
RUNX1, NRAS, TP53, U2AF1, KRAS, PHF6, MSTP9, PTPN11, KIT, SMC3, 
PRUNE2, ETV6, CEBPA, SMC1A, ASXL1, STAG2, RAD21 ) as well as all patient -

 specific mutations discovered during exome sequencing. The leukemic allele 
frequency will be measured using the Illumnia MySeq or HiSeq platform using DNA 
capture by [CONTACT_295822] -oligonucleotides. Patient bone marrow samples 
will be assessed pre-study , Cycle 1 D ay 10 ± 1 , Cycle 1 D ay 28 ± 4 , and Cycle 2 D ay 
28 ± 4 and compared with patient specific skin samples (normal control). The 
velocity of response will be calculated as the natural log rate of patient -specific 
mutation allele frequency clearance. Depth of response will be defined as the lowest 
patient -specific mutation allele frequency in a bone marrow sample. The velocity and 
depth of tumor response will be  correlated to:  
 Achievement of clinical CR,  
 Time to best response,  
 Mutational status,  
 Time to disease progression.  
Because all patient -specific exome -discovered mutations will be assessed a second 
time in the primary bone marrow sample as well as the  Cycl e 1 Day 10 ± 1, Cycle 1 
Day 28 ± 4, and Cycle 2 Day 28  ± 4 bone marrow samples, t his study will also serve 
to validate all exome -discovered mutations. This is important, because exome 
sequencing is associated with a 20 -50% false -discovery rate depending on  type I error 
tolerated  (mutation -calling algorithms are typi[INVESTIGATOR_295757]) .  Thus, many mutations discovered during exome sequencing are 
incorrect.  This second analysis of these mutations will server to exclude these false 
positive calls.  
 
3. To correlate the bone marrow e xpression profile  from pre -study  and Cycle 1 Day 10 
± 1 with response to decitabine . 
We will correlate expression signatures, and changes in expression signatures, with : 
 Achievement of clinical CR,  
 Mutat ion status . 
 
4. To correlate steady -state plasma decitabine concentration on Cycle 1  Day 4 ± 1 with:  
 Achievement of CR.  
 
5. To correlate the extent of b one marrow DNA hypomethylation  on Cycle 1 Day 10 ± 1 
with response to decitabine . 
We will assess the percent reduction in bone marrow methylcytosine content using 
LC-MS. Patients will be evaluated pre-study  and Cycle 1 Day 10 ± 1. The change in 
DNA methylcytosine content will be correlated to:  
 Achievement of clinical CR,  
 Change in expre ssion signature . 
This will determine whether inadequate blast exposure to decitabine correlates with 
drug resistance.

received cytotoxic induction chemotherapy are also excluded , because cytotoxic therapy 
offers a curative possibility for these patients.  MDS patients without cytopenias are als o 
excluded because these patients can be followed with watchful -waiting . 
 
All patients will undergo bone marrow biopsies pre-study,  on Cycle 1  Day 10 ± 1, and on 
Day 28 ± 4 of Cycles 1, 2, 4, and 6 . Following Cycle 6, bone marrow biopsies should be 
performed at the discretion of the treating physician to assess for relapse or progression . 
Patients will provide a skin biopsy sample pre -study.  Patients will also provide peripheral 
blood samples on Cycl e 1 Day 4 ± 1 for pharmacokinetic studies.  See Section 8.0 for 
details  on correlative studies .  
 
Patients will receive decitabine 20 mg/m2/day as a 1 -hour infusion on consecutive Days 
1-10 in 28 -day cycles.   The dose will be calculated based on actual pati ent weight at the 
beginning of each cycle.  
 
Once AML patients achieve morphologic complete remission with incomplete blood 
count recovery (CRi)  or MDS patients achieve a marrow complete response (Marrow 
CR) as defined in Section 9 .0, decitabine administration may be decreased to five 
consecutive days to limit myelosuppressive toxicity  at the discretion of the  treating 
physician. After two cycles of five consecutive days of treatment, if the patient meets the

administration  may further be decrease d to three  consecutive days per cycle  at the 
discretion of the  treating physician . 
 
It will be a logistical goal of this trial consistently to return preliminary exome results t o 
the treating physician by [CONTACT_42334] 1 and validated results by [CONTACT_42334] 2. 
However, this logistical goal is not a primary or secondary aim of this study. Given the 
limited data regarding mutation presence and drug response, we do not antic ipate that the 
results will directly influence therapeutic decisions made by [CONTACT_1963]. 
However, the development of comprehensive genomic pi[INVESTIGATOR_295739] a clinical trial setting will be required before personalized  medicine can be

 6.0 DOSE MODIFICATIONS  
 
A criterion for discontinuation of the study is a delay of > 8 weeks between any two 
cycles.  
 
6.1 Delay for Cytopenia or Infection  
 
As cytopenias  are a defining feature of AML and MDS, their presence alone does not 
generally warrant dose modifications or delays. Patients will receive four cycles of 
therapy without adjustment for any cytopenia.  Following Cycle 4, dose modifications or 
delays for cyt openias will be made at the discretion of the investigator .  
 
Patients with febrile neutropenia (temperature ≥ 38.5° with ANC < 1,000/ l) or systemic 
infections should have treatment held until clinical resolution of the infection.  
 
6.2 Delay for Organ Dysfun ction  
 
If ren al dysfunction (creatinine ≥ 3  X institutional upper limit of normal) or hepatic 
dysfunction ( bilirubin ≥ 2.5  mg/dl or ALT/AST ≥ 3 X institutional upper limit of normal)  
occurs, therapy may not resume until the abnormalities have resolved to below the limits 
stated above. If renal or hepatic dysfunction occurs during  a treatment course, the next 
dose of decitabine should be held, and serum chemistries should be checked tw ice per 
week.  Decitabine can be resumed at full dose when creatinine, bilirubin, ALT and AST 
are below the limits listed above.  
 
For grade 3 -4 non -hematologic toxicities  related to decitabine , decitabine treatment 
should be delayed until recovery to base line or to grade ≤ 1. Decitabine may be 
reintroduced with a 50% dose reduction, or at full dose at the discretion of the 
investigator.  
 
6.3 Modification in Dose or Schedule  for Treatment Response  
 
Once AML patients achieve morphologic complete remission with i ncomplete blood 
count recovery (CRi)  or MDS patients achieve a marrow complete response (Marrow 
CR) as defined in Section 9 .0, decitabine administration may be decreased to 5 
consecutive days to limit myelosuppressive toxicity  at the discretion of the  treating 
physician. After two cycles of five consecutive days of treatment, if the patient meets the 
definition of CR with complete cytogenetic response as defined in Section 9 .0, 
administration  may further be decrease d to three  consecutive days per cycle  at the 
discretion of the  treating physician .

[CONTACT_295820], a major mechanism for gene expression. In some cancer 
cells, hypermethylation blocks the activity of tumor suppressor  genes, which regulate cell 
division and differentiation to prevent malignant transformation. When suppressor gene 
activity is blocked, cell division becomes unregulated, leading to the formation of 
neoplastic cells. Decitabine regulates DNA methylation (s pecifically targets the 
methyltransferase , DNMT1 ), effectively demethylating and reactivating different tumor 
suppressor genes. Because hypermethylation occurs early in the malignant transformation 
of cells, decitabine may have activity in chemoprevention.  Other possible mechanisms 
for decitabine activity include cytotoxicity due to incorporation into DNA similar to other 
antimetabolites, methylation -independent induction of gene expression, and degradation 
of DNA methyltransferase 1.

 9.0 EFFICACY, SAFETY A ND CORRELATIVE STUDY MEASURES  
 
A secondary  endpoint of this study is to estimate morphologic complete remission rate.  
  
9.1 Response Criteria  - AML  
 
AML Patients will be assessed for response according to the IWG criteria:1  
 
Morphologic complete remission  (CR)  – Defined as morphologic leukemia -free state, 
defined as less than 5% blasts in aspi[INVESTIGATOR_295740] a count of ≥200 
nucleated cells and no blasts with Auer rods or any persis tence of extramedullary disease. 
When erythroid precursors cons titute less than 50% of bone marrow nucleated cells, the 
percentage of blasts is based on all nucleated cells; when there are 50% or more erythroid 
cells, the percentage blasts should be based on the nonerythroid cells. The presence of 
mild megaloblastoid changes may be permitted if they are thought to be consistent with 
treatment effect. However, persistence of pretreatment abnormalities (eg, pseudo -Pelger -
Hüet cells, ringed sideroblasts, dysplastic megakaryocytes) are not consistent with CR.   
In addition,  ANC >1000/μl and platelet count of ≥100,000/μl. Patient must be 
independent of transfusions. No duration requirement for this designation.  
 
Cytogenetic complete remission (CCR) – Defined as morphologic complete remission 
plus a reversion to a normal karyo type. For this study, reversion of a normal karyotype is 
defined as no clonal abnormalities detected in a minimum of 20 mitotic cells.  
 
Morphologic complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery  (CRi)  – Defined 
as morphologic complete recovery with the exception of neutropenia <1000/μl or 
thrombocytopenia <100,000/μl.  
 
Partial remission  (PR) – Defined as meeting the above criteria for complete remission, 
with the following exceptions: decrease of ≥50% in the percentage of blast to 5 -25% in 
the bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337]. A value of 5% blasts in bone marrow with Auer rods present 
may also be considered a partial remission.  
 
Stable Disease (SD) – Defined as not meeting th e definitions of CR, CRi, PR, PD , or 
recurrence/morphologic relapse.   
 
Progressi ve disease  (PD) – Defined as a clear increase in bone marrow blast count, 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] a greater than 50% increase compared with baseline , or new extramedullary 
disease . Patients with a > 50% increase in peripheral blast count with an increase of the 
total peripheral white blood cell count to > 10,000/ l should undergo evaluation by [CONTACT_295793] .  
 
Recurrence/morphologic relapse  - Defined as relapse following complete remission is 
defined as reappearance of blasts in the blood or the finding of ≥5% blasts in the bone 
marrow, not attributable to any other cause. New dysplastic changes is considered 
Genomic Predictors of Decitabine Response in AML/MDS  
 
Amendment 2 Version date: 03/10/14  
 relapse. If there are no blasts in the peripher al blood and 5 -20% blasts in the bone 
marrow, bone marrow biopsy should be repeated in > 1 week to confirm relapse.  
 
9.2 Response Criteria  - MDS  
 
MDS Patients will be assessed for response according to the IWG criteria:69 
 
Complete remission  (CR)  – Defined as < 5% myeloblasts with normal maturation of all 
cell lines in the bone marrow and peripheral blood values of Hgb > 11g/dL, Platelets > 
100 x 109/L, Neutrophils > 1.0 x 109/L, and 0% blasts. Persistent dysplasia does not 
exclude CR but will be noted.  
 
Marrow Complete Response ( Marrow CR) – Defined as < 5% myeloblasts in the bone 
marrow and a decrease by > 50% from pretreatment values, but not meeting the 
definition of CR above.  
 
Partial Remission ( PR) – Defined as meeting the definition of CR above wit h a decrease 
of myeloeblasts in the bone marrow by > 50% from pretreatment values, but absolute 
myeloblasts still >5%.  
 
Stable Disease (SD) – Defined as not meeting the definitions of CR, Marrow CR, PR, 
SD, PD, or recurrence/morphologic relapse.   
 
Progre ssive Disease//Relapse  (PD) – Defined as ≥ 50% increase in blasts to > 5% blasts 
(for patients with less than 5% blasts at baseline only), ≥ 50% increase to > 10% blasts 
(for patients with 5 -10% blasts at baseline only), ≥ 50% increase to > 20% blasts (for  
patients with l0 -20% blasts at baseline only), ≥ 50% increase to > 30% blasts (for patients 
with 20 -30% blasts at baseline only) or any of the following: At least 50% decrement 
from maximum remission/response in granulocytes or platelets, reduction in Hgb  by ≥ 2 
g/dL, or New or worsened transfusion dependence not related to study drug toxicity . Or

Amendment 2 Version date: 03/10/14  
 number in the previous 8 wk. Only RBC transfusions given for a Hgb of ≤ 9.0 
g/dL pretreatment will count in the RBC transfusion response evaluation  
 
Platelet response requires one of the following (only required if pretreatment 
platelets < 100 x 109/L):  
 Absolute increase of ≥ 30 x 109/L (for patients starting with > 20 x 109/L

12.2 Statistical Analysis  
 
12.2.1  Descriptiv e Analyses  
 
Patient Disposition : The number of patients discontinued, the reasons for 
discontinuation, and the number of cycles administered will be summarized.  
 
Demographics and Baseline Characteristics : Descriptive summary statistics will

minimum and maximum will be provided.  For categorical variables, the number 
and percent of patients in each demograph ic/characteristic category will be 
summarized.  
 
12.2.2  Primary Endpoint Analysis  
 
The primary end -point of this phase II study is the correlation biomarkers with 
overall response in AML/MDS patients to decitabine.  
 
We will correlate the presence of patient specific mutations  (especially mutations  
in DNMT3A, IDH1, IDH2, and TET2 ) with overall response rates. Mutation rates 
in these genes and in other patient -specific genes will be correlated with overall 
response and t heir respective 95% confidence intervals will be provided.  
 
Statistical considerations. The relationship between AML/MDS -associated 
mutations and the responsiveness to decitabine will be described by [CONTACT_295797] -square test or Fisher’s exact test as appropriate. The 
differentially expressed genes between responders and non -responders will be 
determined using the significance analysis of microarray (SAM). Multivariate 
logistic regression will also be fit to adjust the potential confounding effects of 
other demographic and clinical characteristics. The resultant critical P values will 
be corrected for multiple testing.  Since the Bonferroni correction is known to be 
too conservative, a permutation analysis (e.g., 10,000 random assignments for 
Genomic Predictors of Decitabine Response in AML/MDS  
 
Amendment 2 Version date: 03/10/14  
 responsive status) will be u sed to derive an empi[INVESTIGATOR_295745] P value.  The new 
critical p -value is the number of permutation tests which yield a lower p -value 
than the original test divided by [CONTACT_295798]. [61]   
 
A power analysis was performed using Chi -square test for the association 
between mutation and response to decitabine. The frequency of DNMT3A, 
IDH1/2, and TET2 mutations in AML and MDS patients are each between 15% 
and 30% in multiple cohorts. [29-37] Table 3  shows the minimal detectable 
differences of response rates between mutant and wild -type cases, assuming an 
expected overall 45% CR/CRi  rate and 80% power. For an average of 20% 
frequency of a mutated gene, for example, 100 patients will provide 80% power 
to detect 30% difference at a [ADDRESS_360976] 30% of clinical 
response could be attributed 
to the presence of a specific 
mutation. However, we 
anticipate that mor e power 
could be achieved as we 
assess patient groups with 
combined characteristics 
(e.g. DNMT3A mutation or 
loss of DNMT3A 
expression). In addition, we 
expect that the majority of the enrolled 125 patients can be used in the analysis 
(since all of our mol ecular information will be acquired within 30 days of 
enrollment, we anticipate a drop -out rate of 20% or less).  
 
12.2.3  Secondary Endpoint Analyses  
 
The overall response rate (CR/CRi/PR) and complete response rate (CR/CRi) will 
be compared with historical contro ls[2], and the 95% confidence intervals will be 
provided.  
 
The rate of patient spe cific mutation clearance after 10, 28, and 56 days of therapy 
will be determined using an Illumina based platform. We will compare the rate of 
mutation clearance between the patients who achieve a CR/CRi  after 4 cycles and 
those who do not.  We anticipate that we will identify between 6 and 25 exonic 
SNVs per case (the range obtained with >200 AML samples sequenced to date 
with whole genome or exome sequencing), and that the expected 95% confidence Table 3 . Detectable mutation associated response rates  (80% power, α = 0.05)

 interva l of the mean variant allele frequency will be ±2.56% and ±1.25%, 
respectively, if we assume an anticipated standard deviation of 3.2% within the 
same clone. The change of tumor burden over time and its association with 
clinical response will  be assessed using [ADDRESS_360977] ANOVA for repeated 
measurement data, followed by [CONTACT_295799] -hoc multiple comparisons for between -
group differences (e.g., responders vs. non -responders) at given time points as 
well as the between -time differences within each group. The resultant c ritical P 
values will also be corrected using permutation analysis for multiple testing.  
 
The steady -state plasma  decitabine concentration on day 4 ± 1 will be measured 
and correlated with clinical overall response.  
 
The percent decrease in bone marrow  methylcytosine will be calculated on day 
10±1. We will compare this reduction with previously published data and between 
the patients who achieve CR/CRi and those who do not.  The correlation of peak 
plasma  levels of decitabine with response will be assesse d using [ADDRESS_360978] 
ANOVA for repeated measurement data, followed by [CONTACT_295799] -hoc multiple 
comparisons for between -group differences (e.g., responders vs. non -responders) 
and between -time differences. Similar analyses will be performed for the 
correlation of expression profiles a nd SNP analysis with pharmacokinetic data.   
 
Statistical power justification.   A power analysis was performed using two -
sample t -test for between -group difference and paired t -test for the change over 
time. For tumor clearance, this will provide > 99% pow er to detect a 10% 
difference in the means at two separate time points for clones with 6 or more 
variants, and > 98% power to detect a 15% difference if there are 3 or more 
variants per clone with α = 0.05 (power will decrease to 91% and 82%, 
respectively,  in cases where the standard deviation is 4.7%, the maximum we 
have observe d thus far). For pharmacologic correlations, we anticipate 85% 
power to determine a 25 ng/ml difference between the average C max of 45 
evaluable responders and 55 evaluable non -responders with an anticipated 
average C max of 70 ng/ml and a standard deviation of 40 ng/ml within the entire 
cohort, and with α = 0.05. [22] We believe a less significant difference would not 
be sufficient to warrant application in clinical decision making (i.e. whether to 
continue therapy for more than 1 cycle). We anticipate 99% power to determine a 
difference of 20% in the reduction of bone  marrow methylcytosine between [ADDRESS_360979] 
deviation of 15% and α = 0.05. [28, 66-68] The difference in methylcytosine 
reduction previously observed wa s 30% between patients achieving CR/PR and 
those with only hematologic improvement. [28]  
 
Time to relapse and time to death will also be listed for each patient.

 Study Schema:  
 
 
Patients with p rogressive disease after two cycles ( defined as a clear increase in bone marrow blast count, typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] a 
> 50% increase in bone marrow blasts over baseline ) should be removed from study . 
Patients with stable disease may conti nue on study and should undergo a diagnostic bone marrow biopsy at the end 
of even numbered cycles.  
Once AML patients achieve morphologic complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi) or MDS 
patients ac hieve a marrow complete response (Marrow CR) as defined in Section 9 .0, decitabine 
administration may be decreased to five consecutive days to limit myelosuppressive toxicity at the 
discretion of the  treating physician. After two cycles of five consecutive days of treatment, if the patient 
meets the definition of CR with complete cytogenetic response as defined in Section 9 .0, administration 
may further be decreased to three  consecutive days per cycle  at the discretion of the  treating physician.  
Sample collection for correlative studies:  
Bone marrow biopsies should be performed at baseline , at Cycle 1 Day 10 ± 1 , at Cycle 1 Day 28  ± 4, and 
at the end of even numbered cycles . 
Peripheral blood sample s should be co llected on Day 4± 1 of Cycle 1.  Collection should be obtained 45 ±

Amendment 1 Version date: 10/29/2013  
5 1.0 INTRODUCTIO N 
 
1.1 Rational e   
 
Personalized therapy for cancer requires that 1) patient -specific factors (e.g. patient -
specific mutations, expression profiles, or pharmacogenomics) influence treatment 
algorithms, and 2) once therapy is initiated, in vivo  responsiveness is used to guide 
further therapy. The modern era of genomics has provided significant insights into cancer 
pathogenesis by [CONTACT_295778], as well as defining 
disease -specific patterns of gene expression. However, the application and i ntegration of 
this data with therapeutics remains a difficult task.  
 
Decitabine is a commonly used single -agent therapy for patients with acute myeloid 
leukemia ( AML ) and/or myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ). Historically, it has yielded 
clinical complete res ponses in approximately 25% of patients across diverse clinical 
trials, it is well tolerated, and it can be given as in the outpatient  setting . However, the 
majority of patients do not respond to decitabine, the molecular etiology of decitabine 
sensitivity  is unknown, and there are no algorithms to predict patient responsiveness a 
priori or even within one month of starting therapy.   
 
AML and MDS are two closely related hematological disorder s characterized by 
[CONTACT_295812].  Both AML 
and MDS frequently occur  in elderly patients and some cases are secondary and/or 
related to long -term bone marrow damage after radiation or chemotherapy.  Current 
therapy for AML consists of cytotoxic chemotherapy followed by [CONTACT_295813]. Using these approaches, current cure rates 
may be as high as 60% for patients younger than 60 with good risk cytogenetics (e.g.  
t(15;17 ), t(8;21), inv(16)) .[4]  Outcomes in patients ≥ 60 year s old and with relapsed 
disease remain poor with 2 year survival of only ~25%. [5] Historically, t he available 
treatment f or MDS has been symptomatic and has not been shown to be effective in 
producing sustained improvement in hematopoiesis or in delaying leukemic evolution [6, 
7].  
 
Current  AML therapy is poorly tolerated in elderly and pre -treated patients due to  
hematologic and non -hematologic toxicities; following such th erapy, patients typi[INVESTIGATOR_295732] 3 -4 weeks of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_295733] . Even among the relatively healthy patients enrolled in clinical trials, 
induction mortality in the elderly can be as high as 20-40% following standard induction 
therapy ,[8-11] and moderate to severe non -hematologic toxicity occurs in at least an 
additional 30% of patients. [9, 12 -14] Consequently, many older AML patients are not 
offered traditional intensive chemotherapy, but re ceive supportive care alone. [15]  More 
effective and less toxic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_295734] a significant 
proportion of elder ly AML in population s. 
 
Decitabine has been studied in  MDS patients and in  elderly  and/or relapsed  AML 
patients . It has been found to be reasonably well tolerated, can be given in the outpatient

6 setting , and has overall response rates of 20 -45%.[2, 3, 16 -20] Our own experience has 
been of CR/PR rates of 25% , [2] and this is typi[INVESTIGATOR_295763] (reviewed in [21]  Decit abine is an S -phase depended drug.  [22 -24] 
However, decitabine is usually administered  in one hour daily infusions  during 3  to 5 
consecutive days  (too short to expose decitabine to most AM L blasts  during at least 2 
cycles of replication , which divide every 2  to 7 days). [25-27]  Recent experience with 
increasing  the number of infusion s per cycle from 5 consecutive days to 10 consecutive 
days has improved overall response rates to 67%. [3] Response to decitabine can be slow, 
sometimes requiring 3  to 5 cycles before maximum response is observed. [2] As a 
consequence, many patients are exposed to prolonged therapy, gaining little benefit, 
before determining resistance. There are currently no biomarkers that predict response t o 
decitabine.  
 
Decitabine is a cytosine analogue that cannot be methylated. Incorporation of decitabine 
into DNA prevents DNA methylation at cytosine residues and derepresses epi[INVESTIGATOR_295736]. Therefore, the reduction in total genomi c DNA methylcytosine 
content acts as a marker of effective decitabine dosing. Indeed, two groups have recently 
correlated effective methylcytosine reduction and gene expression derepression to 
response  (Figure 1.1) .[3, 28] 
 
  
   
Figure 1.1. From Shen et al JCO (2010) 28:611 and Blum et al JCO (2007) 25: 3884.  
 
We and others have recently  used whole genome sequencing to identify  recurrent, 
somatic mutations in AML and MDS patients in four genes that are involved in 
methylcytosine regulation: DNMT3A, IDH1, IDH2, and TET2. [29-37] Collectively, 
nearly half of all AML/MDS patients have a mutation in one of these four genes.  
DNMT3A mutations are associated with an adverse outcome in AML patients trea ted with 
cytotoxic chemotherapy. [35, 38] However, it is not yet clear whether the presence of 
mutations in one or more of these genes is associated with response or resistance to 
decitabine.  
 
 
Genomic Predictors of Decitabine Response in AML/MDS  
 
Amendment 1 Version date: 10/29/2013  
7 In th is study, we will treat patients with the current state -of-the-art decitabine 
schedule. [3] We will perform exome sequencing on all patients  and correlate response 
with mutation status, rate of mutat ion clearance , expression profile, plasma  decitabine 
levels , and DNA methylcytosine content reduction. This approach will comprehensively 
assess genomic and pharmacologic parameters that could clin ically predict p atient 
response to decitabine.  
 
In this study , we will combine analysis of patients with AML and MDS. Recent genomic 
analysis has shown that AML and MDS have share d mutations in many of the same 
genes , shared patterns of mutation acquisiti on, and shared patterns of mutation 
evolution .[39, 40] Furthermore, MDS, like AML, presents  with clonal hematopoiesis, 
even when the morphologic blast count is zero. [36]Because this study will identify and 
track the rate of clearance of patient specific mutations, and because decitabine has been 
shown to have efficacy in both AML and MDS patients,  [2, 3, 16 -19, 41 -45] combining 
analysis of AML and MDS patients is reasonable.   Asymptomatic MDS patien ts are 
excluded because these patients are typi[INVESTIGATOR_295737] -waiting rather than 
with chemotherapy.  
  
1.2 Decitabine  and Hypomethylating agents in AML /MDS  
 
Methylation of cytosine in the CpG dinucleotide by [CONTACT_295781] a 
significant mechanism for the loss of tumor suppressor gene expression in human cancer, 
including AML  and MDS .[46, 47] Like azacitidine , decitabine  (5-aza-2’-deoxycitidine) is 
incorporated into DNA during S phase and forms covalent adducts with DNA 
methyltransferase. The irreversible inhibition of this enzyme results in loss of 
methylation and is associated  with differentiation. [48]  Decitabine is an approximately [ADDRESS_361008]  at higher doses  (1-2 µM) .[49]  
 
Decitabine has been investigated in hematologic malignancies using a range of doses and 
schedules.  It is currently FDA approved for the treatment of adults with MDS at a dose 
of 15 mg/m2 every 8 hours for 3 days, based on a Phase III study that demonstrated 
improved outcomes in the treatment arm compared to patients treated with supportive 
care alone. [15]  However, the overall response rate  in this trial w as modest ( 17%). Of 
note, 18% of the patients in th is trial had 20 -30% bone marrow blasts, meeting the 
current WHO criteria for AML.  Subsequent p hase I and II studies in AML, using a 
variety of low -dose decitabine regimens, have reporte d overall response rates of 22 -
49%.[2, 3, 16 -19, 41 -45] Comparisons of multiple low do se schedules have noted 
improved efficacy in the MDS population using a dose of 20 mg/m2 on Days 1 -5 of a 28 -
day cycle. [50, 51 ] Because of these result s, we have recently explored this dosing 
schedule in the treatment of elderly patients with AML. [52] In this study, we observe d an 
overall response rate of 24 %, and an additional  44% of patients achiev ed stable disease 
during a median of 5 monthly cycles. [48] In this study, we noted that decitabine  does not 
Genomic Predictors of Decitabine Response in AML/MDS  
 
Amendment 1 Version date: 10/29/[ADDRESS_361009] quickly and the median time to response was 3 months. These results are similar to 
the recently published experience in [LOCATION_013] treating 227 patients with 15 mg/m2 over 3 
hours TID for 3 days eve ry 6 weeks, which resulted in a CR/PR rate of 26%. [16]  
 
A recent study using a prolonged administration schedule (20 mg/m2 IV over 1 hour on 
consecutive days 1 -10) showed improved  response (64 % CR/PR) and improved time to 
respond (50% of patients had bone marrow blasts < 5% after 1 cycle of therapy). [3]  
These results are an improvement over previous experience by [CONTACT_295814], and this 
experience is summarized below:

In general, decitabine  is well tolerated. Unlike conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy, 
decitabine  can be administered in the outpatient setting. However, AML  and MDS are  
aggressive hematologic malignanc ies. Cy topenias commonly result from AML /MDS  
inhibition of normal hematopoiesis , and often do not resolve until a complete response is 
achieved. Thus, neutropenic sepsis and thrombocytopenic bleeding remain significant  
problems regardless  of therapy, especially during the first 4 -8 weeks. In our experience 
treating elderl y AML patients, neutropenia occurred in 24%, sepsis in 9% , and 
bacteremia in 7%.  Similar results have been observed in MDS patients. [20, 53, 54 ] As a

patients, and most commonly res ulting from infection  and cytope nias related to disease 
and the rapy.[16, 52, 55 ] While unsettling, these numbers are better t han many historical 
patients  treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy , and suggest a need for continued 
improvements in therapy .[9, 12]   
 
1.2.1 Pharmacokinetics and Metabol ism of Decitabine  
 
In human subjects , after IV administration, decitabine displayed a distribution 
phase with a half -life of 7 minutes and a terminal phase elimination half -life of 10-
35 minutes as measured by [CONTACT_295783]. [56, 57]   The short plasma half -life is due to 
rapid inactivation of decitabine by [CONTACT_295824] l iver cytidine deaminase. [23] 
Total body clearance (Cl p) in humans was high with a mean value of  126 
mL/min/kg. [58]  
 
Among five adult patients with adv anced solid tumors administered seven courses 
of 100 mg/m2 of decitabine by 1 -hour infusions, [56] maximum plasma 
concentration ranged from [ADDRESS_361014] infusion 
and a slower decline over the next two hours to 6 nM, the level of detectabilit y. 
Plasma half -life (mean SE) was estimated to be approximately 7 1 minutes in 
the initial phase (t ½α) and 355 minutes in the second phase (t ½β). The area under 
the plasma concentration -time curve was 408 88 ng.hour/mL for these patients, 
with a peak plas ma concentration of 2.01 0.44 µM (0.44 0.1 µg/mL), while mean 
volume of distribution (Vd ss) and CLp was 4.59 1.42 L/kg and 126 21 
mL/min/kg, respectively. The time course of DAC concentrations was similar in 1 
of 2 patients administered 75 mg/m2, while DAC  was usually undetectable in the 
plasma of patients administered 25 to 60 mg/m2. 
 
Using a longer infusion time (up to 40 hours), Rivard et al. [57] reported a plasma 
concentration of 0.1 to 0.4 g/mL. With infusion times of 40 -60 hours, at an 
infusion rate of 1 mg/kg/h, plasma concentrations of 0.43 -0.76 µg/mL were 
achieved. [59]  The steady -state plasma concentration at an infusion rate of 
1 mg/kg/h was estimated to be 0.2 -0.5 µg/mL. The half -life after discontinuing the 
infusion was 12 -20 min.[57]  
 
Urinary excretion of unchanged decitabine was low, ranging from less than 0.01% 
to 0.9% of the total dose, and there was no relationship between excretion and dose 
or plasma drug levels. High clearance va lues and a total urinary excretion of <1% 
of the administered dose suggest that decitabine is eliminated rapi[INVESTIGATOR_295738], including extrahepatic metabolism. [60] 
 
The steady state plasma concentrations (C ss) ranged from 0.31 to 0.39 µg/mL 
(1.27 to 1.60 µM) during the infusion  of 100 mg/m² decitabine over a 6 -hour 
period. [61] The range of concentrations during a 600 mg/m2 infusion over an 8-
hour period  was 0.41 -16 g/mL (1.68 to 4.76 µM). [60] These plasma

10 concentrations are in the same range as the in vitro concentrations that activated 
the expression of tumor suppressor gene p16 in three human non -small -cell lung 
cancer (NSCLC) cell lines. [61]  
 
Steady state decitabine levels of 0.1 to 0.2 µM were achieved in solid tumor 
patients dosed with 30 mg/m²/day and 40 mg/m²/day by [CONTACT_295815] 72 hours. [62]

In our experience  treating primary patient blasts in vitro , concentrations of 100 – 
500 nM are required maximize methylcytosine reduction without causing cellular 
toxicity. Because decitabine incorporation into DNA is S -phase dependent, 
exposure of cells during cell divisi on is necessary for efficacy.  
  
 
 
 
1.2.2 Experience with  extended dosing schedules  
 
Blum et al recently published their experience treating  elderly AML patients with 
a 10 -day course of decitabine 20 mg/m2/day as a 1 -hour infusion .[3] This

Amendment 1 Version date: 10/29/[ADDRESS_361015] 
divisions exposed to decitabine per cycle. Toxicities were very similar to a similar 
regiment give n as a 3 and 5 day course ,[2, 16]  but the overal l response (CR/PR) 
was much improved (64 % vs 25%). In all three  studies, the toxicities were 
primarily myeloid suppression and the resultant infectious and bleeding 
complications associated  with leukemic and pharmacologic hematopoietic 
suppression. Furthermore, Blum et al noted that the percent methylcytosine 
reduction was improved (22% vs 11%) as was the time to blast clearance (50% of 
patients who ultimately achieved a CR had ≤ 5% bone mar row blasts after 1 cycle 
vs 0% of patients after 2 cycles). Finally, like Shen et al , they observed a 
correlation between the extent of methylcytosine reduction and response. [28]  
This study suggests that improvement in response rates and time t o response can 
be achieved by [CONTACT_295816]. Further, that DNA 
methylcytosine reduction can be achieved with prolonged exposure to decitabine 
and that this might be a patient -specific biological marker of adequate  dosing.  
  
Scandura et al. recently published a study of infusional decitabine prior to 
cytarabine + daunorubicin induction therapy for AML. [64] They escalated the 
duration of infusional therapy and reached their planned goal of 20 mg/m2/day x 7 
days of continuous therapy given prior to cytarabine and daunorubicin. They 
noted similar toxicities (primarily hematopoietic and the associated neutropenic 
infections) , but that these were not different from their experience givin g 
cytarabine + daunorubicin alone.  
 
1.3 Correlative Studies  
 
With exception of the peripheral blood sample collected on Cycle 1 Day 4, all correlative 
studies will be collected under  HRPO# 201011766 (“Tissue Acquisition for Analysis of 
Genetic Progression Factors in Hematologic Diseases ”) that all patients will be 
concurrently enrolled in.  The goals of the correlative studies include:  
 
1. To correlate p atient -specific mutations  with resp onse to decitabine . 
We will perform exome sequencing of each patient’s pre-study  bone marrow sample 
and skin sample. We will determine AML/MDS -associated variants found in the bone 
marrow, but not skin sample. We will correlate the presence of mutations wi th 
response (especially mutations in DNMT3A,  IDH1, IDH2, and TET2 ). This study is 
powered to identify mutations with >80% sensitivity to predict decitabine response if 
used as a clinical assay.  
 
2. To correlate the v elocity and depth of response  with response to decitabine . 
We will assess tumor burden by [CONTACT_295786] -specific mutations in bone 
marrow samp les collected pre study , Cycle 1 Day 10±1, Cycle 1 Day 28±4 , and 
Cycle 2 Day 28 ±4. We will assess mutations in at least 24 recurr ently mutated genes 
(including, but not limited to: FLT3, DNMT3A, NPM1, TET2, WT1, IDH1, IDH2, 
RUNX1, NRAS, TP53, U2AF1, KRAS, PHF6, MSTP9, PTPN11, KIT, SMC3, 
PRUNE2, ETV6, CEBPA, SMC1A, ASXL1, STAG2, RAD21 ) as well as all patient -

Amendment 1 Version date: 10/29/2013  
12 specific mutations discov ered during exome sequencing. The leukemic allele 
frequency will be measured using the Illumnia MySeq or HiSeq platform using DNA 
capture by [CONTACT_295825] -oligonucleotides. Patient bone marrow samples 
will be assessed pre-study , Cycle 1 D ay 10  ± 1, Cycle 1 D ay 28 ± 4 , and Cycle 2 D ay 
28 ± 4 and compared with patient specific skin samples (normal control). The 
velocity of response will be calculated as the natural log rate of patient -specific 
mutation allele frequency clearance. Depth of respons e will be defined as the lowest 
patient -specific mutation allele frequency in a bone marrow sample. The velocity and 
depth of tumor response will be correlated to:  
 Achievement of clinical CR,  
 Time to best response,  
 Mutational status,  
 Time to disease progre ssion.  
Because all patient -specific exome -discovered mutations will be assessed a second 
time in the primary bone marrow sample as well as the  Cycle 1 Day 10 ± 1, Cycle 1 
Day 28 ± 4, and Cycle 2 Day 28  ± 4 bone marrow samples, t his study will also serve 
to validate all exome -discovered mutations. This is important, because exome 
sequencing is associated with a 20 -50% false -discovery rate depending on type I error 
tolerated  (mutation -calling algorithms are typi[INVESTIGATOR_295768]).  Thus, many mutations discovered during exome sequencing are 
incorrect.  This second analysis of these mutations will server to exclude these false 
positive calls.  
 
3. To correlate the bone marrow e xpression profile  from pre -study  and Cycle 1 Day 10 
± 1 with response to decitabine . 
We will correlate expression signatures, and changes in expression signatures, with : 
 Achievement of clinical CR,  
 Mutation status . 
 
4. To correlate steady -state plasma decitabine concentration on Cycle 1  Day 4 ± 1 with:  
 Achievement of CR.  
 
5. To correlate the extent of b one marrow DNA hypomethylation  on Cycle 1 Day 10 ± 1 
with response to decitabine . 
We will assess the percent reduction in bone marrow methylcytosine content using 
LC-MS. Patients will be evaluated pre-study  and Cycle 1 Day 10 ± 1. The change in 
DNA methylcytosine content will be correlated to:  
 Achievement of clinical CR,  
 Change in expression signature . 
This will determine whether inadequate blast exposure to decitabine correlates with 
drug resistance.

22 6.0 DOSE MODIFICATIONS  
 
A criterion for discontinuation of the study is a delay of > 8 weeks between any two 
cycles.  
 
6.1 Delay for Cytopenia or Infection  
 
As cytopenias are a defining feature of AML and MDS, their presence alone does not 
generally warrant dose modifications or delays. Patients will receive four cycles of 
therapy without adjustment for any cytopenia.  Following Cycle 4, dose modifications or 
delays for cytopenias will be made at the discretion of the investigator .  
 
Patients with febrile neutropenia (temperature ≥ 38.5° with ANC < 1,000/ l) or systemic 
infections should have treatment held until clinical resolution of the infection.  
 
6.2 Delay for Organ Dysfunction  
 
If ren al dysfunction (creatinine ≥ 3  X institutional upper limit of normal) or hepatic 
dysfunction ( bilirubin ≥ 2.5  mg/dl or ALT/AST ≥ 3 X institutional upper limit of normal)  
occurs, therapy may not resume until the abnormalities have resolved to below the limits 
stated above. If renal or hepatic dysfunction occurs during  a treatment course, the next 
dose of decitabine should be held, and serum chemistries should be checked twice per 
week.  Decitabine can be resumed at full dose when creatinine, bilirubin, ALT and AST 
are below the limits listed above.  
 
For grade 3 -4 non -hematologic toxicities  related to decitabine , decitabine treatment 
should be delayed until recovery to baseline or to grade ≤ 1. Decitabine may be 
reintroduced with a 50% dose reduction, or at full dose at the discretion of the 
investigator.  
 
6.3 Modification in Dose or Schedule  for Treatment Response  
 
Once AML patients achieve morphologic complete remission with incomplete blood 
count recovery (CRi)  or MDS patients achieve a marrow complete response (M arrow 
CR) as defined in Section 9 .0, decitabine administration may be decreased to 5 
consecutive days to limit myelosuppressive toxicity  at the discretion of the  treating 
physician. After two cycles of five consecutive days of treatment, if the patient meets the 
definition of CR with complete cytogenetic response as defined in Section 9 .0, 
administration  may further be decrease d to three  consecutive days per cycle  at the 
discretion of the  treating physician .

[CONTACT_295820], a major mechanism for gene expression. In some cancer 
cells, hypermethylation blocks the activity of tumor suppressor genes, which regulate cell 
division and differentiation to prevent malignant transformation. When suppressor g ene 
activity is blocked, cell division becomes unregulated, leading to the formation of 
neoplastic cells. Decitabine regulates DNA methylation (specifically targets the 
methyltransferase , DNMT1 ), effectively demethylating and reactivating different tumor 
suppressor genes. Because hypermethylation occurs early in the malignant transformation 
of cells, decitabine may have activity in chemoprevention. Other possible mechanisms 
for decitabine activity include cytotoxicity due to incorporation into DNA similar t o other 
antimetabolites, methylation -independent induction of gene expression, and degradation 
of DNA methyltransferase 1.

26 9.0 EFFICACY, SAFETY A ND CORRELATIVE STUDY MEASURES  
 
A secondary  endpoint of this study is to estimate morphologic complete remission rate.  
  
9.1 Response Criteria  - AML  
 
AML Patients will be assessed for response according to the IWG criteria:1  
 
Morphologic complete remission  (CR)  – Defined as morphologic leukemia -free state, 
defined as less than 5% blasts in aspi[INVESTIGATOR_295740] a count of ≥200 
nucleated cells and no blasts with Auer rods or any persis tence of extramedullary disease. 
When erythroid precursors cons titute less than 50% of bone marrow nucleated cells, the 
percentage of blasts is based on all nucleated cells; when there are 50% or more erythroid 
cells, the percentage blasts should be based on the nonerythroid cells. The presence of 
mild megaloblastoid changes may be permitted if they are thought to be consistent with 
treatment effect. However, persistence of pretreatment abnormalities (eg, pseudo -Pelger -
Hüet cells, ringed sideroblasts, dysplastic megakaryocytes) are not consistent with CR.   
In addition,  ANC >1000/μl and platelet count of ≥100,000/μl. Patient must be 
independent of transfusions. No duration requirement for this designation.

12.2 Statistical Analysis  
 
12.2.1  Descriptiv e Analyses  
 
Patient Disposition : The number of patients discontinued, the reasons for 
discontinuation, and the number of cycles administered will be summarized.  
 
Demographics and Baseline Characteristics : Descriptive summary statistics will 
be provided for  demographic and important baseline characteristics.  For 
continuous variables, the number of patients, mean, standard deviation, median, 
minimum and maximum will be provided.  For categorical variables, the number 
and percent of patients in each demograph ic/characteristic category will be 
summarized.  
 
12.2.2  Primary Endpoint Analysis  
 
The primary end -point of this phase II study is the correlation biomarkers with 
overall response in AML/MDS patients to decitabine.  
 
We will correlate the presence of patient specific mutations  (especially mutations  
in DNMT3A, IDH1, IDH2, and TET2 ) with overall response rates. Mutation rates 
in these genes and in other patient -specific genes will be correlated with overall 
response and t heir respective 95% confidence intervals will be provided.  
 
Statistical considerations. The relationship between AML/MDS -associated 
mutations and the responsiveness to decitabine will be described by [CONTACT_295797] -square test or Fisher’s exact test as appropriate. The 
differentially expressed genes between responders and non -responders will be 
determined using the significance analysis of microarray (SAM). Multivariate 
logistic regression will also be fit to adjust the potential confounding effects of 
other demographic and clinical characteristics. The resultant critical P values will 
be corrected for multiple testing.  Since the Bonferroni correction is known to be 
too conservative, a permutation analysis (e.g., 10,000 random assignments for 
Genomic Predictors of Decitabine Response in AML/MDS  
 
Amendment 1 Version date: 10/29/2013  
35 responsive status) will be u sed to derive an empi[INVESTIGATOR_295745] P value.  The new 
critical p -value is the number of permutation tests which yield a lower p -value 
than the original test divided by [CONTACT_295798]. [61]   
 
A power analysis was performed using Chi -square test for the association 
between mutation and response to decitabine. The frequency of DNMT3A, 
IDH1/2, and TET2 mutations in AML and MDS patients are each between 15% 
and 30% in multiple cohorts. [29-37] Table 3  shows the minimal detectable 
differences of response rates between mutant and wild -type cases, assuming an 
expected overall 45% CR/CRi rate and 80% power. For an average of 20% 
frequency of a mutated gene, for example, 100 patients will provide 80% power 
to detect 30% difference at a [ADDRESS_361045] 30% of clinical 
response could be attributed 
to the presence of a sp ecific 
mutation. However, we 
anticipate that more power 
could be achieved as we 
assess patient groups with 
combined characteristics 
(e.g. DNMT3A mutation or 
loss of DNMT3A 
expression). In addition, we 
expect that the majority of the enrolled 125 patients c an be used in the analysis 
(since all of our molecular information will be acquired within 30 days of 
enrollment, we anticipate a drop -out rate of 20% or less).  
 
12.2.3  Secondary Endpoint Analyses  
 
The overall response rate (CR/CRi/PR) and complete response rate (CR/CRi) will 
be compared with historical controls [2], and the 95% confidence intervals will be 
provided.  
 
The rate of patient spe cific mutation clearance after 10, 28, and 56 days of therapy 
will be determined using an Illumina based platform. We will compare the rate of 
mutation clearance between the patients wh o achieve a CR/CRi after 4 cycles and 
those who do not.  We anticipate that we will identify between 6 and 25 exonic 
SNVs per case (the range obtained with >200 AML samples sequenced to date 
with whole genome or exome sequencing), and that the expected 95% confidence Table 3 . Detectable mutation associated response rates  (80% power, α = 0.05)

36 interval of the mean variant allele frequency will be ±2.56% and ±1.25%, 
respectively, if we assume an anticipated standard deviation of 3.2% within the 
same clone. The change of tumor burden over time and its association with 
clinical response will  be assessed using [ADDRESS_361046] ANOVA for repeated 
measurement data, followed by [CONTACT_295799] -hoc multiple comparisons for between -
group differences (e.g., responders vs. non -responders) at given time points as 
well as the between -time differences within each grou p. The resultant critical P 
values will also be corrected using permutation analysis for multiple testing.  
 
The steady -state plasma  decitabine concentration on day 4 ± 1 will be measured 
and correlated with clinical overall response.  
 
The percent decrease in bone marrow  methylcytosine will be calculated on day 
10±1. We will compare this reduction with previously published data and between 
the patients who achieve CR/CRi and those who do not.  The correlation of peak 
plasma  levels of deci tabine with response will be assessed using [ADDRESS_361047] 
ANOVA for repeated measurement data, followed by [CONTACT_295799] -hoc multiple 
comparisons for between -group differences (e.g., responders vs. non -responders) 
and between -time differences. Similar analyses will be performed for the 
correlation of expression profiles and SNP analysis with pharmacokinetic data.   
 
Statistical power justification.   A power analysis was performed using two -
sample t -test for between -group difference and paired t -test for the change over 
time. For tumor cl earance, this will provide > 99% power to detect a 10% 
difference in the means at two separate time points for clones with 6 or more 
variants, and > 98% power to detect a 15% difference if there are 3 or more 
variants per clone with α = 0.05 (power will de crease to 91% and 82%, 
respectively, in cases where the standard deviation is 4.7%, the maximum we 
have observe d thus far). For pharmacologic correlations, we anticipate 85% 
power to determine a 25 ng/ml difference between the average C max of 45 
evaluable responders and 55 evaluable non -responders with an anticipated 
average C max of 70 ng/ml and a standard deviation of 40 ng/ml within the entire 
cohort, and with α = 0.05. [22] We believe a less significant difference would n ot 
be sufficient to warrant application in clinical decision making (i.e. whether to 
continue therapy for more than 1 cycle). We anticipate 99% power to determine a 
difference of 20% in the reduction of bone marrow methylcytosine between [ADDRESS_361048] 
deviation of 15% and α = 0.05. [28, 66-68] The difference in methylcytosine 
reduction previously observed was 30% between patients achieving CR/PR and 
those  with only hematologic improvement. [28]  
 
Time to relapse and time to death will also be listed for each patient.

Phase of development  Phase II 
Study objectives  Primary:   
- To determine whether patient -specific mutations correlate with clinical 
overall response to decitabine in patients with AML or MDS.  
Secondary:   
- To determine whether 10 consecutive days per cycle of decitabine 
improves outcomes compared with historical controls  treated with 5 
consecutive days per cycle of decitabine . 
- To determine whether other biomarkers correlate with clinical overall 
response to decitabine in patients with AML or MDS. The se will include: 
velocity and depth of patient -specific mutation clearance, bone marrow 
expression profile and change in expression profile during decitabine 
treatment, steady -state serum decitabine concentrations, and decrease in 
bone marrow methylcytosin e content in response to decitabine.  
  
Study design  Non-randomized , open -label, Phase II study of decitabine  in patients with

Version date: 09/12/[ADDRESS_361078] be e nrolled in HRPO# 201011766 (“Tissue 
Acquisition for Analysis of Genetic Progression Factors in 
Hematologic Malignancies”).  
8. Patient must be > [ADDRESS_361079] any uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, 
but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, ongoing or active 
GVHD, congestive heart failure of NYHA class 3 or 4, unstable 
angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social 
situat ion that would limit compliance with study requirements.  
7. Patient must not have had radiation therapy within 14 days of 
enrollment .  
 
Expected number of 
patients  Total: 125.  
Evaluable for all molecular studies: 100.  
Enrollment time -table: [ADDRESS_361080] 2 additional sites will be added.  
Study drug formulation 
and administration  Decitabine  (5-aza-2’-deox ycytidine) is a lyophilized white powder available 
for injection in [ADDRESS_361081] is 
reconstituted in 10 mL of sterile water for injection. The reconstituted 
concentrate is further diluted with cold infusion solution to obtain a final 
concentration of decitabine of between 0.1 to 1.0 mg/mL.  
 
All patients will receive decitabine 20 mg/m2 given as a 1 hour continuous 
IV infusion on consecutive days 1 -10 of each cycle ; the dose should be 
calculated based on actual body weight at the beginning of each cycle .  
 
Once patients achieve morphologic complete remission with incomplete 
blood count recovery (CRi)  (morphologic leukemia -free state, defined as less 
than 5% blasts in aspi[INVESTIGATOR_295740] a count of  ≥ 200 
nucleated cells and no blasts with Auer rods, no persistence of 
extramedullary disease, and no persistent pre -treatment morphologic 
abnormalities, such as pseudo -Pelger -Hüet cells, ringed sideroblasts, or 
dysplastic megakaryocytes) administration may be decreased to [ADDRESS_361082] count s < 5% and no evidence of 
disease by [CONTACT_295827], patients may further decrease 
therapy to 3 consecutive days per cycle, per treating physician.  
Each cycle will be 28 ± 4 days.  
Duration of treatment  Treatment may continue until one of the following criteria applies:  
 Death,  
 Disease progression  (as defined in [IP_ADDRESS]),  
 Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment,  
Genomic Predictors of Decitabine Response in AML/MDS  
 
Version date: 09/12/12  
  Unacceptable adverse event(s),  
 Patient decides to withdraw from the study, or  
 General or specific changes in the patient’s condition render the patient 
unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the treating 
physician.  
Correlative studies  Bone marrow samples for correlative studies will be collected prestudy, on 
Cycle 1 day 10 ± 1 and day 28 ± 4, and on day 28 ± 4 of subsequent even 
numbered cycles.  
Peripheral blood samples for correlative studies will be collected  on Cycle 1 
day 4 ± 1.   
 
1. Identify Patient -specific mutations  
We will perform exome sequencing of each patient’s day 0 bone 
marrow sample and skin sample. We will determine AML/MDS -
associated variants, defined as variants found in the bone marrow 
sample and not in the skin sample. We will correlate the presence of 
mutations with overall response.  
2. Velocity and depth of response.  
We will assess the rate of tumor clearance by [CONTACT_295828] -specific mutations in bone marrow samples 
during cycles [ADDRESS_361083] 24 
recur rently mutated genes (including, but not limited to: FLT3, 
DNMT3A, NPM1, TET2, WT1, IDH1, IDH2, RUNX1, NRAS, TP53, 
U2AF1, KRAS, PHF6, MSTP9, PTPN11, KIT, SMC3, PRUNE2, 
ETV6, CEBPA, SMC1A, ASXL1, STAG2, RAD21 ) as well as all 
patient -specific mutations disco vered during exome sequencing. The 
leukemic allele frequency will be measured using the Illumnia 
MySeq or HiSeq platform using DNA capture by [CONTACT_295829] -oligonucleotides, or by a comparable technique. Patient 
bone marrow samples will be ass essed on day 0, day 10 ± 1, and day 
28 ± 4 of cycle 1, and on day 28 ± 4 of cycle 2 and compared with 
patient -specific skin samples (normal control). The velocity of 
response will be calculated as the natural log rate of patient -specific 
mutation allele fr equency clearance. Depth of response will be 
defined as the lowest patient -specific mutation allele frequency in a 
bone marrow sample. The velocity and depth of tumor response will

5. Bone marrow DNA hypomethylation.  
We will assess the percent reduction in bone marrow methylcytosine 
content using LC -MS. This may serve as a better biomarker of 
adequate dosing than serum drug concentration. Patients will be 
evaluated on day 0 and day 10 ± 1 of cycle 1. The change in DNA 
methylcytosine content will be correlated to:  
 Overall response , 
 Change in expression signatures.  
 
  
Criteria for evaluation  Efficacy -  
Bone marrow biopsies should be performed at baseline and at day 10 ± 1 and 
day 28  ± [ADDRESS_361084] bone marrow procurement procedures will be 
followed for collection of the tissu e. Jeffrey Klco, MD/PhD will act 
as a central reviewer for all bone marrow biopsies.  
 
Peripheral blood counts will be followed by [CONTACT_295830]. 
After cycle 1, the frequency of routine CBC analysis may be 
decreased by [CONTACT_295831].   
 
Patients will be assessed for response according to the IWG criteria: [1]  
Morphologic complete remission  (CR) – Defined as morphologic 
leukemia -free state, defined as less than 5% blasts in aspi[INVESTIGATOR_295772] a count of  ≥ 200 nucleated cells and no blasts with 
Auer rods or any persistence of extramedullary disease, and no evidence 
for dysplasia. When ery throid precursors constitute less than 50% of bone 
marrow nucleated cells, the percentage of blasts is based on all nucleated 
cells; when there are 50% or more erythroid cells, the percentage blasts 
should be based on the nonerythroid cells. The presence o f mild 
megaloblastoid changes may be permitted if they are thought to be 
consistent with treatment effect. However, persistence of pretreatment 
abnormalities (eg, pseudo -Pelger -Hüet cells, ringed sideroblasts, 
dysplastic megakaryocytes) are not consistent with CR . In addition, ANC 
> 1000/μl and platelet count of ≥ 100,000/μl. Patient must be independent 
of transfusions. No duration requirement for this designation.  
Cytogenetic complete remission (CCR) – Defined as morphologic complete 
remission plus a rever sion to a normal karyotype. For this study, reversion 
to a normal karyotype is defined as no clonal abnormalities detected in a 
minimum of 20 mitotic cells. Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) 
may be used as a supplement to follow a specifically defin ed cytogenetic 
abnormality.  
Morphologic complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi)  
– Defined as morphologic complete recovery with the exception of 
neutropenia <1000/μl or thrombocytopenia <100,000/μl.  
Partial remission  (PR) – Requires that the above criteria for complete 
remission be met, with the following exceptions: decrease of ≥50% in the 
percentage of blasts to 5 -25% in the bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337]. A value of 
5% blasts in bone marrow with Auer rods present may also be 
considered a pa rtial remission.

 Treatment failure – Includes all patients who did not achieve a complete or 
partial remission.  
Recurrence/morphologic relapse  - Relapse following complete remission is 
defined as reappearance of blasts in the blood or the finding of ≥5% blasts 
in the bone marrow, not attributable to any other cause. New dysplastic 
changes are considered a relapse. If there are no blasts in the peripheral 
blood and 5 -20% blasts in the bone marrow, bone marrow biopsy should 
be repeated in > [ADDRESS_361085] sufficient positive 
predictive value to be used as a clinical assay.  
 
A power analysis was performed with Fisher’s exact test for mutation status 
and response to decitabine, assumi ng an expected 45% CR/CRi. With alpha = 
0.05, and a total anticipated enrollment of 100 evaluable patients, we 
anticipate 80% power to detect a 27% and 40% response difference between 
patients with and without a mutation, if the mutation occurs with a resp ective 
frequency of 30% and 15%. Such mutations would provide 80%  sensitivity 
to predict response to decitabine. These are values that would warrant 
diagnostic clinical testing prior to therapy.  
 
This trial is also designed to detect an improvement in cl inical response 
compared to historical controls treated with 5 consecutive days of decitabine 
(20 mg/m2/day every 28 days) [2]. A power analysis was performed with 
Fisher’s exact test for response to decitabine compared to a historical rate of 
24% observed in 55 patients. With 100 evaluable patients enrolled, we 
anticipate 90% power with alpha = 0.[ADDRESS_361086] a 21% improvement in 
response (CR/ PR ≥ 45%). The reported CR/PR rate of the proposed 
treatment schedule (10 consecutive days of decitabine 20 mg/m2/day) is 
64%[3]; the expected CR/PR rate of 45% is a conservative estimation of 
expected outcomes.

 Study Schema:  
 
 
Patients with p rogressive disease after two cycles ( defined as a clear increase in bone marrow blast count, typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] a 
> 50% increase in bone marrow blasts over baseline ) should be removed from study . 
Patients with stable disease may conti nue on study and should undergo a diagnostic bone marrow biopsy at the end 
of even numbered cycles.  
After 2 cycles, if patients achieve morphologic CRi, administration will be decreased to 5 days to limit 
myelosuppressive toxicity  (20 mg/m2 over 1 hour on Days 1 -5 every 28 ± 4 days) . After two cycles with 
morphologic CRi and no evidence of disease by [CONTACT_295827] , patien ts may further 
decrease therapy to 3 days per cycle  (20 mg/m2 over 1 hour on Days 1 -3 every 28 ± 4 days) . 
Sample collection for correlative studies:  
Bone marrow biopsies should be performed at baseline and at Day 10 ± 1  and Day 28  ± 4 of Cycle 1 and at 
the end of even numbered cycles . 
 
Peripheral blood sample s should be co llected on Day 4± 1 of Cycle 1.  Collection should be obtained 45 ±

10 1.0 INTRODUCTIO N 
 
1.1 Rational e   
 
Personalized therapy for cancer requires that 1) patient -specific factors (e.g. patient -
specific mutations, expression profiles, or pharmacogenomics) influence treatment 
algor ithms, and 2) once therapy is initiated, in vivo  responsiveness is used to guide further 
therapy. The modern era of genomics has provided significant insights into cancer 
pathogenesis by [CONTACT_295778], as well as defining 
disease -specific patterns of gene expressio n. However, the application and integration of 
this data with therapeutics remains a difficult task.  
 
Decitabine is a commonly used single -agent therapy for patients with acute myeloid 
leukemia ( AML ) and/or myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ). Historically, it has yielded 
clinical complete responses in approximately 25% of patients across diverse clinical trials, 
it is well tolerated, and it can be given as in the outpatient  setting . However, the majority 
of patients do not respond to decitabine, the molecular e tiology of decitabine sensitivity is 
unknown, and there are no algorithms to predict patient responsiveness a priori or even 
within one month of starting therapy.  
 
AML and MDS are two closely related hematological disorder s characterized by 
[CONTACT_295812].  Both AML 
and MDS frequently occur  in elderly patients and some cases are secondary and/or related 
to long -term bone marrow damage after radiation or chemotherapy.  Current therapy for 
AML consists of cytotoxic chemotherapy followed by [CONTACT_295780]. Using these approaches, current cure rates may be as high as 60% for 
patients younger than 60 with good risk cytogenetics (e.g.  t(15;17 ), t(8;21), inv(16)) .[4]  
Outcomes in patients ≥ 60 year s old and with relapsed disease remain poor with 2 year 
survival of only ~25%. [5] Historically, t he available treatment f or MDS has been 
symptomatic and has not been shown to be effective in producing sustained improvement 
in hematopoiesis or in delaying leukemic evolution [6, 7] .  
 
Current  AML therapy is poorly tolerated in  elderly and pre -treated patients due to  
hematologic and non -hematologic toxicities; following such therapy, patients typi[INVESTIGATOR_295732] 3 -4 weeks of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_295733] . Even among the relatively  healthy patients enrolled in clinical trials, induction 
mortality in the elderly can be as high as 20 -40% following standard induction therapy ,[8-
11] and moderate to severe non -hematologic toxicity occurs in at least an additional 30% 
of patients. [9, 12 -14] Consequently, many older AML patients are not offered traditional 
intensive chemotherapy, but receive supportive care alone. [15]  More effective and less 
toxic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_295734] a significant proportion of 
elder ly AML in population s. 
 
Decitabine has been studied in  MDS patients and in  elderly  and/or relapsed  AML patients . 
It has been found to be reasonably well tolerated, can be given in the  outpatient  setting , 
and has overall response rates of 20 -45%.[2, 3, 16 -20] Our own experience has been of 
Genomic Predictors of Decitabine Response in AML/MDS  
 
Version date: 09/12/12  
11 CR/PR rates of 25% , [2] and this is typi[INVESTIGATOR_295735] (reviewed in [21]  Decitabine is an S -phase depended drug.  [22 -24] However, 
decitabine is usually administered  in one hour daily infusions  during 3  to 5 consecutive 
days (too short to expose decitabine to most AM L blasts  during  at least 2 cycles of 
replication , which divide every 2  to 7 days). [25-27]  Recent experience with increasing the 
number of infusion s per cycle from 5 consecutive days to 10 consecutive days has 
improved overall response rates to 67%. [3] Response to decitabine can be slow, sometimes 
requiring 3  to 5 cycles befo re maximum response is observed. [2] As a consequence, many 
patients are exposed to prolonged therapy, gaining little benefit, before determining 
resistance. There are currently no biomarkers that predict response to decitabine.  
 
Decitabine is a cytosine analogue that cannot be methylated. Incorporation of decitabin e 
into DNA prevents DNA methylation at cytosine residues and derepresses epi[INVESTIGATOR_295736]. Therefore, the reduction in total genomic DNA methylcytosine 
content acts as a marker of effective decitabine dosing. Indeed, two groups have recently 
correlated effective methylcytosine reduction and gene expression derepression to 
response  (Figure 1.1) .[3, 28] 
 
  
   
Figure 1.1. From Shen et al JCO (2010) 28:611 and Blum et al JCO (2007) 25: 3884.  
 
We and others have recently  used whole genome sequencing to identify  recurrent, somatic 
mutations in AML and MDS patients in four gen es that are involved in methylcytosine 
regulation: DNMT3A, IDH1, IDH2, and TET2. [29-37] Collectively, nearly half of all 
AML/MDS patients have a mutation in one of these four genes.  DNMT3A mutations are 
associated with an adverse outcome in AML patients treated with c ytotoxic 
chemotherapy. [35, 38] However, it is not yet clear whether the presence of mutations in 
one or more of these genes is associated with response or res istance to decitabine.  
 
In this study, we will treat patients with the current state -of-the-art decitabine schedule. [3] 
We will perform exome sequencing on all patients and correlate response with mutation 
status, rate of mutat ion clearance , expression profile, serum decitabine levels , and DNA

Version date: 09/12/[ADDRESS_361088] share d mutations in many of the same genes , 
shared patterns of mutation acquisition, and shared patterns of mutation evolution .[39, 40] 
Furthermore, MDS, like AML, presents  with clonal hematopoiesis, even when the 
morphologic blast count is zero. [36]Because this study will identify and track the rate of 
clearance of patient specific mutations, and because decitabine has be en shown to have 
efficacy in both AML and MDS patients,  [2, 3, 16 -19, 41 -45] combining analysis of AML 
and MDS patients is reasonable.   Asymptomatic MDS patients are excluded because these 
patients are typi[INVESTIGATOR_295737] -waitin g rather than with chemotherapy.  
  
1.2 Decitabine  and Hypomethylating agents in AML /MDS  
 
Methylation of cytosine in the CpG dinucleotide by [CONTACT_295781] a 
significant mechanism for the loss of tumor suppressor gene expression in human cancer, 
including AML  and MDS .[46, 47] Like azacitidine , decitabine  (5-aza-2’-deoxycitidine) is 
incorporated into DNA during S phase and forms covalent adducts with DNA 
methyltransferase. The irreversible inhibition of this enzyme results in loss of methylation 
and is associated with differentiation. [48]  Decitabine is an approximately [ADDRESS_361089] at higher doses  (1-2 µM) .[49]  
 
Decitabine has been investigated in hematologic malignancies using a range of doses and 
schedules.  It is currently FDA approved for the treatment of adults with MDS at a dose of 
15 mg/m2 every 8 hours for 3 days, based on a Phase III study that demonstrated improved 
outcomes in the treatment arm compared to patients treated with supportive care alone. [15]  
However, the overall response rate  in this trial w as modest ( 17%). Of note, 18% o f the 
patients in th is trial had 20 -30% bone marrow blasts, meeting the current WHO criteria for 
AML.  Subsequent p hase I and II studies in AML, using a variety of low -dose decitabine 
regimens, have reporte d overall response rates of 22 -49%.[2, 3, 16 -19, 41 -45] Comparisons 
of multiple low dose schedules have noted improved efficacy in the MDS population using 
a dose of 20 mg/m2 on Days 1 -5 of a 28 -day cycle. [50, 51 ] Because of these results, we 
have recently explored this dosing schedule in the treatment of elderly patients with 
AML. [52] In this study, we observe d an overall response rate of 24 %, and an additional  
44% of patients achiev ed stable disease during a median of 5 monthly cycles. [48] In this 
study, we noted that decitabine  does not act quickly and the median time to response was 
3 months. These results are similar to the recently published experience in [LOCATION_013] 
treating 227 patients with 15 mg/m2 over 3 hours TID for 3 days every 6 weeks, which 
resulted in a CR/PR rate of 26%. [16]

13 A recent study using a prolon ged administration schedule (20 mg/m2 IV over 1 hour on 
consecutive days 1 -10) showed improved  response (64 % CR/PR) and improved time to 
respond (50% of patients had bone marrow blasts < 5% after 1 cycle of therapy). [3]  These 
results are an improvement over previous experience by [CONTACT_295782], and this experience is

In general, decitabine  is well tolerated. Unlike conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy, 
decitabine  can be administered in the outpatient setting. However, AML  and MDS are  
aggressive hematologic malignanc ies. Cy topenias commonly result from AML /MDS  
inhibition of normal hematopoiesis , and often do not resolve until a complete response is 
achieved. Thus, neutropenic sepsis and thrombocytopenic bleeding remain significant  
problems regardless  of therapy, especially during the first 4 -8 weeks. In our experience 
treating elderl y AML patients, neutropenia occurred in 24%, sepsis in 9% , and bacteremia 
in 7%.  Similar results have been observed in MDS patients. [20, 53, 54 ] As a result, death 
is not uncommon in the first 8 weeks of t herapy, occurring in 15 -17% of patients, and most 
commonly resulting from infection  and cytope nias related to disease and the rapy.[16, 52, 
55] While unsettling, these numbers are better than many historical patients  treated with 
cytotoxic chemotherapy , and suggest a need for continued improve ments in therapy .[9, 12]

1.2.1 Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism of Decitabine  
 
In human subjects , after IV administration, decitabine displayed a distribution phase 
with a half -life of 7 minutes and a terminal phase elimination half -life of 10-35 
minutes as measured by [CONTACT_295783]. [56, 57]   The short plasma half -life is d ue to rapid 
inactivation of decitabine by [CONTACT_295784]. [23] Total 
body clearance (Cl p) in humans was high with a mean value of 126 mL/min/kg. [58]  
 
Among five adult patients with advanced solid tum ors administered seven courses 
of 100 mg/m2 of decitabine by 1 -hour infusions, [56] maximum plasma 
concentration ranged from [ADDRESS_361093] infusion 
and a slower decline over the next two hours to 6 nM, the level of detectability. 
Plasma half -life (mean SE) was estimated to be approximately 7 1 minutes in the 
initial phase (t ½α) and 355 minutes in the second pha se (t ½β). The area under the 
plasma concentration -time curve was 408 88 ng.hour/mL for these patients, with a 
peak plasma concentration of 2.01 0.44 µM (0.440.1 µg/mL), while mean volume 
of distribution (Vd ss) and CLp was 4.59 1.42 L/kg and 126 21 mL/min/kg, 
respectively. The time course of DAC concentrations was similar in 1 of 2 patients 
administered 75 mg/m2, while DAC was usually undetectable in the plasma of 
patients administered 25 to 60 mg/m2. 
 
Using a longer infusion time (up to 40 hours), R ivard et al. [57] reported a plasma 
concentration of 0.1 to 0.4 g/mL. With infusion times of 40 -60 hours, at an infusion 
rate of 1 mg/kg/h, plasma concentra tions of 0.43 -0.76 µg/mL were achieved. [59]  The 
steady -state plasma concentration at an infusion rate of 1  mg/kg/h was estimated to 
be 0.2 -0.5 µg/mL. The half -life after discontinuing the infusion was 12 -20 min.[57]  
 
Urinary excretion of unchanged decitabine was low, ranging from less than 0.01% to 
0.9% of the total dose, and there was no relationship between excretion and dose o r 
plasma drug levels. High clearance values and a total urinary excretion of <1% of the 
administered dose suggest that decitabine is eliminated rapi[INVESTIGATOR_295738], including extrahepatic metabolism. [60] 
 
The steady state plasma concentrations (C ss) ranged from 0.31 to 0.39 µg/mL (1.27 
to 1.60 µM) during the infusion of 100 mg/m² decitabine over a 6 -hour period. [61] 
The range of concentr ations during a 600 mg/m2 infusion over an 8 -hour period  was 
0.41-16 g/mL (1.68 to 4.76 µM). [60] These plasma concentrations are in the same 
range as the in vitro concentrations that activated the expression of tumor 
suppressor gene p16 in three human non -small -cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell 
lines. [61]  
 
Steady state decitabine levels of 0.1 to 0.2 µM were achieved in solid tumor patients 
dosed with 30 mg/m²/day an d 40 mg/m²/day by [CONTACT_108660] 72 hours. [62]

In our experience  treating primary patient blasts in vitro , concentrations of 100 – 
500 nM are required maximize methylcytosine reduction without causing cellular 
toxicity. Because decitabine incorporation into DNA is S -phase dependent, 
exposure of cells during cell division is necessary for efficacy.  
  
 
 
 
1.2.2 Experience with  extended dosing schedules  
 
Blum et al recently published their experience treating  elderly AML patients with 
a 10-day course of decitabine 20 mg/m2/day as a 1 -hour infusion .[3] This prolonged 
exposure course was designed to increase the number of AML blast divisions 
exposed to decitabine per cycle. Toxicities were very similar to a  similar regiment 
given as a 3 and 5 day course ,[2, 16]  but the overal l response (CR/PR) was much 
improved (64% vs 25%). In all three  studies, the toxicities were primarily myeloid 
suppression and the resultant infectious and bleeding complications associated with 
leukemic and pharmacologic hematopoietic suppression. Furthermore, Blum et al 
noted that the perce nt methylcytosine reduction was improved (22% vs 11%) as 
 
Genomic Predictors of Decitabine Response in AML/MDS  
 
Version date: 09/12/[ADDRESS_361094] clearance (50% of patients who ultimately achieved a CR had 
≤ 5% bone marrow blasts after 1 cycle vs 0% of patients after 2 cycles). Finally, 
like Shen et al, they observed a co rrelation between the extent of methylcytosine 
reduction and response. [28]  This study suggests that improvement in response 
rates and time to response can be achieved by [CONTACT_295785]. Further, that DNA methylcytosine r eduction can be achieved with 
prolonged exposure to decitabine and that this might be a patient -specific biological 
marker of adequate  dosing.  
  
Scandura et al. recently published a study of infusional decitabine prior to 
cytarabine + daunorubicin inductio n therapy for AML. [64] They escalated the 
duration of infusional therapy and reached their planned goal of 20 mg/m2/day x 7 
days of continuous therapy given prior to cytarabine and daunorubicin. They noted 
similar toxicities (primarily hematopoietic and the associated neutropenic 
infections) , but that these were not different from their experience giving cytarabine 
+ daunorubicin alone.  
 
1.3 Correlative Studies  
 
The goals of the correlative studies include:  
 
1. To correlate p atient -specific mutations  with response to decitabine . 
We will perform exome sequencing of each patient’s Day 0 bone marrow sample and 
skin sample. We will determine AML/MDS -associated variants found in the bone 
marrow, but not skin sample. We w ill correlate the presence of mutations with response 
(especially mutations in DNMT3A,  IDH1, IDH2, and TET2 ). This study is powered to 
identify mutations with >80% sensitivity to predict decitabine response if used as a 
clinical assay.  
 
2. To correlate the v elocity and depth of response  with response to decitabine . 
We will assess tumor burden by [CONTACT_295786] -specific mutations in bone 
marrow samp les collected on day 0, 10 ±1, 28±4 , and 56±[ADDRESS_361095] 24 recurrently mut ated genes (including, but not limited to: FLT3, DNMT3A, 
NPM1, TET2, WT1, IDH1, IDH2, RUNX1, NRAS, TP53, U2AF1, KRAS, PHF6, 
MSTP9, PTPN11, KIT, SMC3, PRUNE2, ETV6, CEBPA, SMC1A, ASXL1, STAG2, 
RAD21 ) as well as all patient -specific mutations discovered duri ng exome sequencing. 
The leukemic allele frequency will be measured using the Illumnia MySeq or HiSeq 
platform using DNA capture by [CONTACT_295825] -oligonucleotides. Patient 
bone marrow samples will be assessed on day 0, day 10 ± 1 , and day 28 ±  4 of cycle 1, 
and day 28 ± 4 of cycle 2 and compared with patient specific skin samples (normal 
control). The velocity of response will be calculated as the natural log rate of patient -
specific mutation allele frequency clearance. Depth of response will b e defined as the 
lowest patient -specific mutation allele frequency in a bone marrow sample. The 
velocity and depth of tumor response will be correlated to:  
 Achievement of clinical CR,  
 Time to best response,  
Genomic Predictors of Decitabine Response in AML/MDS  
 
Version date: 09/12/12  
17  Mutational status,  
 Time to disease progression.  
Because all patient -specific exome -discovered mutations will be assessed a second 
time in the primary bone marrow sample as well as the Day 10 ± 1, 28 ± 4, and 56 ± 4 
bone marrow samples, t his study will also serve to validate all exome -discovered 
mutation s. This is important, because exome sequencing is associated with a 20 -50% 
false -discovery rate depending on type I error tolerated  (mutation -calling algorithms 
are typi[INVESTIGATOR_295773]) .  Thus, many mutations 
discovered d uring exome sequencing are incorrect.  This second analysis of these 
mutations will server to exclude these false positive calls.  
 
3. To correlate the bone marrow e xpression profile  on Day 0 and Day 10 ± 1 with response 
to decitabine . 
We will correlate expres sion signatures, and changes in expression signatures, with : 
 Achievement of clinical CR,  
 Mutation status . 
 
4. To correlate steady -state serum decitabine concentration on Day 4 ± 1 with:  
 Achievement of CR.  
 
5. To correlate the extent of b one marrow DNA hypomethylation  on Day 10 ± 1 with 
response to decitabine . 
We will assess the percent reduction in bone marrow methylcytosine content using LC -
MS. Patients will be evaluated on Day 0 and Day 10 ± 1 of Cycle 1. The change in 
DNA methylcytosine content will be correlated to:  
 Achievement of clinical CR,  
 Change in expression signature . 
This will determine whether inadequate blast exposure to decitabine correlates with 
drug resistance.

promyelocytic leukemia. AML patients who are < [ADDRESS_361103] not received 
cytotoxic induction chemotherapy are also excluded , because cytotoxic therapy offers a 
curative possibility for these patients.  MDS patients without cytopeni as are also excluded 
because these patients can be followed with watchful -waiting . 
 
All patients will undergo bone marrow biopsies prior to therapy, on Day 10 ± 1, and on

27 6.0 DOSE MODIFICATIONS  
 
6.1 Delay for Cytopenia or Infection  
 
As cytopenias are a defining feature of AML  and MDS , their presence alone does not 
generally warrant dose modifications or delays. Patients will receive four cycles of therapy 
without adjustment for any cytopenia.  
 
Patients with febrile neutropenia (temperature ≥ 38.5° with ANC < 1,000/ l) or systemic 
infections should have treatment held until clinical resolution of the infection. A patient 
will meet criterion for discontinuation of the study if the patient is observed to have a delay 
of > 8 weeks between any two cycles.  
 
6.2 Delay for Organ Dysfunction  
 
If ren al dysfunction (creatinine ≥ 3  X institutional upper limit of normal) or hepatic 
dysfunction ( bilirubin ≥ 2.5  mg/dl or ALT/AST ≥ 3 X institutional upper limit of normal)  
occurs, therapy may not resume until the abnormalities have resolved to below the limits 
stated above. If renal or h epatic dysfunction occurs during  a treatment course, the next dose 
of decitabine should be held, and serum chemistries should be checked twice per week.  
Decitabine can be resumed when creatinine, bilirubin, ALT and AST are below the limits 
listed above.  
 
For grade 3 -4 non -hematologic toxicities, decitabine treatment should be delayed until 
recovery to baseline or to grade ≤ 1. For toxicities felt to be related to decitabine, decitabine 
may be reintroduced with a 50% dose reduction, or at the discretion of  the investigator.  
 
6.3 Modification in Dose or Schedule  
 
Once patients achieve morphologic complete remission with incomplete blood count 
recovery (CRi)  (morphologic leukemia -free state, defined as less than 5% blasts in aspi[INVESTIGATOR_295774] a co unt of  ≥ 200 nucleated cells and no blasts with Auer rods, 
any persistence of extramedullary disease, or persistent pre -treatment morphologic 
abnormalities, such as pseudo -Pelger -Hüet cells, ringed sideroblasts, or dysplastic 
megakaryocytes) , administrati on may be decreased to [ADDRESS_361113]

may further decrease therapy t o 3 consecutive days per cycle, per treating physician . 
 
Genomic Predictors of Decitabine Response in AML/MDS  
 
Version date: 09/12/[ADDRESS_361114] by [CONTACT_295804], a major mechanism for gene expression. In some cancer cells, 
hypermethylation blocks the activity of tumor suppressor genes, which regulate cell 
division and differentiation to prevent malignant transformation. When suppressor g ene 
activity is blocked, cell division becomes unregulated, leading to the formation of 
neoplastic cells. Decitabine regulates DNA methylation (specifically targets the 
methyltransferase , DNMT1 ), effectively demethylating and reactivating different tumor 
suppressor genes. Because hypermethylation occurs early in the malignant transformation 
of cells, decitabine may have activity in chemoprevention. Other possible mechanisms for 
decitabine activity include cytotoxicity due to incorporation into DNA similar t o other 
antimetabolites, methylation -independent induction of gene expression, and degradation of 
DNA methyltransferase 1.

31 9.0 EFFICACY, SAFETY AND CORRELATIVE STUDY MEASURES  
 
A secondary  endpoint of this study is to estimate morphologic complete remission rate.  
  
9.1 Response Criteria  
 
Patients will be assessed for response according to the IWG criteria:1  
 
Morphologic complete remission  (CR)  – Defined as morphologic leukemia -free state, 
defined as less than 5% blasts in aspi[INVESTIGATOR_295740] a count of ≥200 
nucleated cells and no blasts with Auer rods or any persis tence of extramedullary disease. 
When erythroid precursors constitute less than 50% of bone marrow nucleated cells, the 
percentage  of blasts is based on all nucleated cells; when there are 50% or more erythroid 
cells, the percentage blasts should be based on the nonerythroid cells. The presence of mild 
megaloblastoid changes may be permitted if they are thought to be consistent with 
treatment effect. However, persistence of pretreatment abnormalities (eg, pseudo -Pelger -
Hüet cells, ringed sideroblasts, dysplastic megakaryocytes) are not consistent with CR.   In 
addition, ANC >1000/μl and platelet count of ≥100,000/μl. Patient must be in dependent of 
transfusions. No duration requirement for this designation.  
 
Cytogenetic complete remission (CCR) – Defined as morphologic complete remission plus 
a reversion to a normal karyotype. For this study, reversion of a normal karyotype is 
defined as  no clonal abnormalities detected in a minimum of 20 mitotic cells.  
 
Morphologic complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery  (CRi)  – Defined as 
morphologic complete recovery with the exception of neutropenia <1000/μl or 
thrombocytopenia <100,00 0/μl.  
 
Partial remission  (PR) – Requires that the above criteria for complete remission be met, 
with the following exceptions: decrease of ≥50% in the percentage of blast to 5 -25% in the 
bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337]. A value of 5% blasts in bone marrow with Auer  rods present may 
also be considered a partial remission.  
 
Treatment failure – Includes all patients who did not achieve a complete or partial 
remission  following 4 cycles of therapy .  
 
Recurrence/morphologic relapse  - Relapse following complete remission  is defined as 
reappearance of blasts in the blood or the finding of ≥5% blasts in the bone marrow, not 
attributable to any other cause. New dysplastic changes are considered a relapse. If there 
are no blasts in the peripheral blood and 5 -20% blasts in the  bone marrow, bone marrow 
biopsy should be repeated in > 1 week to confirm relapse.

32 9.2 Guidelines for Evaluation of Disease

12.2 Statistical Analysis  
 
12.2.1  Descriptive Analyses  
 
Patient Disposition : The number of patients discontinued, the reasons for 
discontinuation, and the number of cycles administered will be summarized.  
 
Demographics and Baseline Characteristics : Descriptive summary statistics will 
be provided for demographic and important baseline characteristics.  For 
continuous variables, the number of patients, mean, standard deviation , median, 
minimum and maximum will be provided.  For categorical variables, the number 
and percent of patients in each demographic/characteristic category will be 
summarized.  
 
12.2.2  Primary Endpoint Analysis  
 
The primary end -point of this phase II study is the correlation biomarkers with 
overall response in AML/MDS patients to decitabine.  
 
We will correlate the presence of patient specific mutations  (especially mutations  
in DNMT3A, IDH1, IDH2, and TET2 ) with overall response r ates. Mutation rates 
in these genes and in other patient -specific genes will be correlated with overall 
response and t heir respective 95% confidence intervals will be provided.  
 
Statistical considerations. The relationship between AML/MDS -associated 
mutati ons and the responsiveness to decitabine will be described by [CONTACT_295797] -square test or Fisher’s exact test as appropriate. The 
differentially expressed genes between responders and non -responders will be 
determined using the  significance analysis of microarray (SAM). Multivariate 
logistic regression will also be fit to adjust the potential confounding effects of other 
demographic and clinical characteristics. The resultant critical P values will be 
corrected for multiple test ing.  Since the Bonferroni correction is known to be too 
conservative, a permutation analysis (e.g., 10,000 random assignments for 
Genomic Predictors of Decitabine Response in AML/MDS  
 
Version date: 09/12/12  
39 responsive status) will be used to derive an empi[INVESTIGATOR_295745] P value.  The new 
critical p -value is the number of permutati on tests which yield a lower p -value than 
the original test divided by [CONTACT_295798]. [61]   
 
A power analysis was performed using Chi -square test for the association between 
mutation and response to decitabine. The frequency of DNMT3A, IDH1/2, and 
TET2 mutations in AML and MDS patients are each between 15% and 30% in 
multiple cohorts. [29-37] Table 3  shows the minimal detectable differences of 
response rates between mutant and wild -type cases, assuming an expected overall 
45% CR/CRi rate and 80% power. For an average of 20% frequency of a mutated 
gene, for example, 100 patients will provide 80% power to detect 30% difference 
at a [ADDRESS_361123] 
30% of clinical response 
could be attributed to the 
presence of a sp ecific 
mutation. However, we 
anticipate that more power 
could be achieved as we 
assess patient groups with 
combined characteristics 
(e.g. DNMT3A mutation or 
loss of DNMT3A expression). 
In addition, we expect that 
the majority of the enrolled 
125 patients c an be used in the analysis (since all of our molecular information will 
be acquired within 30 days of enrollment, we anticipate a drop -out rate of 20% or 
less).  
 
12.2.3  Secondary Endpoint Analyses  
 
The overall response rate (CR/CRi/PR) and complete response rate (CR/CRi) will 
be compared with historical controls [2], and the 95% confidence intervals will be 
provided.  
 
The rate of patient spe cific mutation clearance after 10, 28, and 56 days of therapy 
will be determined using an Illumina based platform. We will compare the rate of 
mutation clearance between the patients wh o achieve a CR/CRi after 4 cycles and 
those who do not.  We anticipate that we will identify between 6 and 25 exonic 
SNVs per case (the range obtained with >200 AML samples sequenced to date with 
whole genome or exome sequencing), and that the expected 95% confidence Table 3 . Detectable mutation associated response rates  (80% power, α = 0.05)

40 interval of the mean variant allele frequency will be ±2.56% and ±1.25%, 
respectively, if we assume an anticipated standard deviation of 3.2% within the 
same clone. The change of tumor burden over time and its association with clinical 
response will  be assessed using [ADDRESS_361124] ANOVA for repeated measurement data, 
followed by [CONTACT_295799] -hoc multiple comparisons for between -group differences (e.g., 
responders vs. non -responders) at given time points as well as the between -time 
differences within each grou p. The resultant critical P values will also be corrected 
using permutation analysis for multiple testing.  
 
The steady -state serum decitabine concentration on day 4 ± 1 will be measured and 
correlated with clinical overall response.  
 
The percent decrease i n bone marrow  methylcytosine will be calculated on day 
10±1. We will compare this reduction with previously published data and between 
the patients who achieve CR/CRi and those who do not.  The correlation of peak 
serum levels of decitabine with response wi ll be assessed using [ADDRESS_361125] ANOVA 
for repeated measurement data, followed by [CONTACT_295799] -hoc multiple comparisons for 
between -group differences (e.g., responders vs. non -responders) and between -time 
differences. Similar analyses will be performed for the correlation of expressio n 
profiles and SNP analysis with pharmacokinetic data.   
 
Statistical power justification.   A power analysis was performed using two -sample 
t-test for between -group difference and paired t -test for the change over time. For 
tumor clearance, this will provide > 99% power to detect a 10% difference in the 
means at two separate time points for clo nes with 6 or more variants, and > 98% 
power to detect a 15% difference if there are 3 or more variants per clone with α = 
0.05 (power will decrease to 91% and 82%, respectively, in cases where the 
standard deviation is 4.7%, the maximum we have observe d thus far). For 
pharmacologic correlations, we anticipate 85% power to determine a 25 ng/ml 
difference between the average C max of 45 evaluable responders and 55 evaluable 
non-responders with an anticipated average C max of 70 ng/ml and a standard 
deviation o f 40 ng/ml within the entire cohort, and with α = 0.05. [22] We believe a 
less significant difference would n ot be sufficient to warrant application in clinical 
decision making (i.e. whether to continue therapy for more than 1 cycle). We 
anticipate 99% power to determine a difference of 20% in the reduction of bone 
marrow methylcytosine between [ADDRESS_361126] deviation of 15% and α = 0.05. [28, 66-68] 
The difference in methylcytosine reduction previously observed was 30% between 
patients achieving CR/PR and those  with only hematologic improvement. [28]  
 
Time to relapse and time to death will also be listed for each patient.

Phase of development  Phase II 
Study objectives  Primary:   
- To determine whether patient -specific mutations correlate with clinical 
overall response to decitabine in patients with AML or MDS.  
Secondary:   
- To determine whether 10 consecutive days per cycle of decitabine 
improves outcomes compared with historical controls  treated with 5 
consecutive days per cycle of decitabine . 
- To determine whether other biomarkers correlate with clinical overall 
response to decitabine in patients with AML or MDS. The se will include: 
velocity and depth of patient -specific mutation clearance, bone marrow 
expression profile and change in expression profile during decitabine 
treatment, steady -state serum decitabine concentrations, and decrease in 
bone marrow methylcytosin e content in response to decitabine.

situation that would limit compliance with study requirements.  
6. Patient must n ot have had radiation therapy within 14 days of 
enrollment .  
 
Expected number of 
patients  Total: 125.  
Evaluable for all molecular studies: 100.  
Enrollment time table: [ADDRESS_361159] 2 additional sites will be added.  
Study drug formulation 
and administration  Decitabin e (5-aza-2’-deoxycytidine) is a lyophilized white powder available 
for injection in [ADDRESS_361160] is 
reconstituted in 10 mL of sterile water  for injection. The reconstituted 
concentrate is further diluted with cold infusion solution to obtain a final 
concentration of decitabine of between 0.1 to 1.0 mg/mL.  
 
All patients will receive decitabine 20 mg/m2 given as a 1 hour continuous 
IV infusion on consecutive days 1 -10 of each cycle ; the dose should be 
calculated based on actual body weight at the beginning of each cycle .  
 
Once patients achieve morphologic complete remission with incomplete 
blood count recovery (CRi)  (morphologic leukemia -free s tate, defined as less 
than 5% blasts in aspi[INVESTIGATOR_295740] a count of  ≥ 200 
nucleated cells and no blasts with Auer rods, no persistence of 
extramedullary disease, and no persistent pre -treatment morphologic 
abnormalities, such as pseudo -Pelger-Hüet cells, ringed sideroblasts, or 
dysplastic megakaryocytes) administration may be decreased to [ADDRESS_361161] counts < 5% and no evidence of 
disease by [CONTACT_295827], patients may further decrease 
therapy to 3 consecutive days per cycle, per treating physician.  
Each cycle will be 28 ± 4 days.  
Duration of treatment  Treatment may continue until one of the following criteria applies:  
 Death,  
 Disease progression  (as defined in [IP_ADDRESS]),  
 Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment,  
 Unacceptable adverse event(s),  
 Patient decides to withdraw from the study, or

Version date: 08/01/12  
  General or specific changes in the patient’s condition render the patient 
unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the treating 
physician.  
Correlative studies  Bone marrow samples for correlative studies will be collected prestudy, on 
Cycle 1 day 10 ± 1 and day 28 ± 4, and on day 28 ± 4 of subsequent even 
numbered cycles.  
Peripheral blood samples for correlative studies will be collected prestudy, 
and on Cycle 1 day 4 ± 1.   
 
1. Identify Patient -specific mutation s 
We will perform exome sequencing of each patient’s day 0 bone 
marrow sample and skin sample. We will determine AML/MDS -
associated variants, defined as variants found in the bone marrow 
sample and not in the skin sample. We will correlate the presence of 
mutations with overall response.  
2. Velocity and depth of response.  
We will assess the rate of tumor clearance by [CONTACT_295828] -specific mutations in bone marrow samples 
during cycles [ADDRESS_361162] 24 
recurrently mutated genes (including, but not limited to: FLT3,  
DNMT3A, NPM1, TET2, WT1, IDH1, IDH2, RUNX1, NRAS, TP53, 
U2AF1, KRAS, PHF6, MSTP9, PTPN11, KIT, SMC3, PRUNE2, 
ETV6, CEBPA, SMC1A, ASXL1, STAG2, RAD21 ) as well as all 
patient -specific mutations discovered during exome sequencing. The 
leukemic allele frequen cy will be measured using the Illumnia 
MySeq or HiSeq platform using DNA capture by [CONTACT_295829] -oligonucleotides, or by a comparable technique. Patient 
bone marrow samples will be assessed on day 0, day 10 ± 1, and day 
28 ± 4 of cycle 1, and  on day 28 ± 4 of cycle 2 and compared with 
patient -specific skin samples (normal control). The velocity of 
response will be calculated as the natural log rate of patient -specific 
mutation allele frequency clearance. Depth of response will be 
defined as th e lowest patient -specific mutation allele frequency in a 
bone marrow sample. The velocity and depth of tumor response will 
be correlated to:  
 Overall response,  
 Time to best response,  
 Mutation status,  
 Time to disease progression . 
 
3. Expression profile.  
Expr ession array profiling will be performed on bone marrow 
samples from day 0 and day 10 ± 1. We will correlate expression 
signatures, and changes in expression signatures, with:  
 Overall response,  
 Mutational status.  
 
4. Steady -state serum decitabine concentra tion. 
We will assess serum decitabine concentration on day 4 ± 1 and 
correlation with:  
 Overall response.

Version date: 08/01/12  
 5. Bone marrow DNA hypomethylation.  
We will assess the percent reduction in bone marrow methylcytosine 
content using LC -MS. This may serve as a better  biomarker of 
adequate dosing than serum drug concentration. Patients will be 
evaluated on day 0 and day 10 ± 1 of cycle 1. The change in DNA 
methylcytosine content will be correlated to:  
 Overall response , 
 Change in expression signatures.  
 
  
Criteria for evaluation  Efficacy -  
Bone marrow biopsies should be performed at baseline and at day 10 ± 1 and 
day 28  ± [ADDRESS_361163] bone marrow procurement procedures will be 
followed for collection of the tis sue. Jeffrey Klco, MD/PhD will act 
as a central reviewer for all bone marrow biopsies.  
 
Peripheral blood counts will be followed by [CONTACT_295830]. 
After cycle 1, the frequency of routine CBC analysis may be 
decreased by [CONTACT_12682] n as clinically indicated.   
 
Patients will be assessed for response according to the IWG criteria: [1]  
Morphologic complete remission  (CR) – Defined as morphologic 
leukemia -free state, defined as less than 5% blasts in aspi[INVESTIGATOR_295772] a count of  ≥ 200 nucleated cells and no blasts with 
Auer rods or any persistence of extramedullary disease, and no evidence 
for dysplasia. Wh en erythroid precursors constitute less than 50% of bone 
marrow nucleated cells, the percentage of blasts is based on all nucleated 
cells; when there are 50% or more erythroid cells, the percentage blasts 
should be based on the nonerythroid cells. The pres ence of mild 
megaloblastoid changes may be permitted if they are thought to be 
consistent with treatment effect. However, persistence of pretreatment 
abnormalities (eg, pseudo -Pelger -Hüet cells, ringed sideroblasts, 
dysplastic megakaryocytes) are not consi stent with CR . In addition, ANC 
> 1000/μl and platelet count of ≥ 100,000/μl. Patient must be independent 
of transfusions. No duration requirement for this designation.  
Cytogenetic complete remission (CCR) – Defined as morphologic complete 
remission plus a  reversion to a normal karyotype. For this study, reversion 
to a normal karyotype is defined as no clonal abnormalities detected in a 
minimum of 20 mitotic cells. Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) 
may be used as a supplement to follow a specifically  defined cytogenetic 
abnormality.  
Morphologic complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi)  
– Defined as morphologic complete recovery with the exception of 
neutropenia <1000/μl or thrombocytopenia <100,000/μl.  
Partial remission  (PR) – Requires that the above criteria for complete 
remission be met, with the following exceptions: decrease of ≥50% in the 
percentage of blasts to 5 -25% in the bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337]. A value of 
5% blasts in bone marrow with Auer rods present may also be 
considere d a partial remission.  
Treatment failure – Includes all patients who did not achieve a complete or 
partial remission.

Version date: 08/01/12  
 Recurrence/morphologic relapse  - Relapse following complete remission is 
defined as reappearance of blasts in the blood or the finding of ≥5% blasts 
in the bone marrow, not attributable to any other cause. New dysplastic 
changes are considered a relapse. If there are no blasts in the peripheral 
blood and 5 -20% blasts in the bone marrow, bone marrow biopsy should 
be repeated in > [ADDRESS_361164] sufficient positive 
predictive value to be used as a clinical assay.  
 
A power analysis was performed with Fisher’s exact test for mutation status 
and response to decitabine, assumi ng an expected 45% CR/CRi. With alpha = 
0.05, and a total anticipated enrollment of 100 evaluable patients, we 
anticipate 80% power to detect a 27% and 40% response difference between 
patients with and without a mutation, if the mutation occurs with a resp ective 
frequency of 30% and 15%. Such mutations would provide 80%  sensitivity 
to predict response to decitabine. These are values that would warrant 
diagnostic clinical testing prior to therapy.  
 
This trial is also designed to detect an improvement in cl inical response 
compared to historical controls treated with 5 consecutive days of decitabine 
(20 mg/m2/day every 28 days) [2]. A power analysis was performed with 
Fisher’s exact test for response to decitabine compared to a historical rate of 
24% observed in 55 patients. With 100 evaluable patients enrolled, we 
anticipate 90% power with alpha = 0.[ADDRESS_361165] a 21% improvement in 
response (CR/ PR ≥ 45%). The reported CR/PR rate of the proposed 
treatment schedule (10 consecutive days of decitabine 20 mg/m2/day) is 
64%[3]; the expected CR/PR rate of 45% is a conservative estimation of 
expected outcomes.

 Study Schema:  
 
 
Patients with p rogressive disease after two cycles ( defined as a clear increase in bone marrow blast count, typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] a 
> 50% increase in bone marrow blasts over baseline ) should be removed from study . 
Patients with stable disease may conti nue on study and should undergo a diagnostic bone marrow biopsy at the end 
of even numbered cycles.  
After 2 cycles, if patients achieve morphologic CRi, administration will be decreased to 5 days to limit 
myelosuppressive toxicity  (20 mg/m2 over 1 hour on Days 1 -5 every 28 ± 4 days) . After two cycles with 
morphologic CRi and no evidence of disease by [CONTACT_295827] , patien ts may further

10 1.0 INTRODUCTIO N 
 
1.1 Rational e   
 
Personalized therapy for cancer requires that 1) patient -specific factors (e.g. patient -
specific mutations, expression profiles, or pharmacogenomics) influence  treatment 
algorithms, and 2) once therapy is initiated, in vivo  responsiveness is used to guide further 
therapy. The modern era of genomics has provided significant insights into cancer 
pathogenesis by [CONTACT_295778],  as well as defining 
disease -specific patterns of gene expression. However, the application and integration of 
this data with therapeutics remains a difficult task.  
 
Decitabine is a commonly used single -agent therapy for patients with acute myeloid 
leukemi a (AML ) and/or myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ). Historically, it has yielded 
clinical complete responses in approximately 25% of patients across diverse clinical trials, 
it is well tolerated, and it can be given as in the outpatient  setting . However, the ma jority 
of patients do not respond to decitabine, the molecular etiology of decitabine sensitivity is 
unknown, and there are no algorithms to predict patient responsiveness a priori or even 
within one month of starting therapy.  
 
AML and MDS are two closely related hematological disorder s characterized by 
[CONTACT_295812].  Both AML 
and MDS frequently occur  in elderly patients and some cases are secondary and/or related 
to long -term bone marrow damage after radiation or chemotherapy. Current therapy for 
AML consists of cytotoxic chemotherapy followed by [CONTACT_295780]. Using these approaches, current cure rates may be as high as 60% for 
patients younger than 60 with good risk cytogenetics (e.g. t(15;17 ), t(8;21), inv(16)) .[4]  
Outcomes in patients ≥ 60 years old and with relapsed disease remain poor with 2 year 
survival of only ~25%. [5] Historically, t he available treatment for MDS has been 
symptomatic and has not been shown to be effective in producing sustained improvement 
in hematopoiesis or in delaying leukemic evolution [6, 7] .  
 
Current  AML therapy is poorly tolerated in elderly and pre -treated patients due to  
hemat ologic and non -hematologic toxicities; following such therapy, patients typi[INVESTIGATOR_295732] 3 -4 weeks of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_295733] . Even among the relatively healthy patients enrolled in clinical trials, induction 
mortality in the elderly can be as high as 20 -40% following standard induction therapy ,[8-
11] and moderate to severe non -hematologic toxicity occurs in at least an additional 30% 
of patients. [9, 12 -14] Consequently, many older AML patients are not offered traditional 
intensive chemotherapy, but receive supportive care alone. [15]  More effective and less 
toxic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_295734] a significant proportion of 
elder ly AML in population s. 
 
Decitabine has been studied in  MDS patients and in  elderly  and/or relapsed  AML patients . 
It has been found to be reasonably well tolerated, can be given in the outpatient  setting , 
and has overall response rates of 20 -45%.[2, 3, 16 -20] Our own experience has been of 
Genomic Predictors of Decitabine Response in AML/MDS  
 
Version date: 08/08/12  
11 CR/PR rates of 25% , [2] and this is typi[INVESTIGATOR_295735] (reviewed in [21]  Decit abine is an S -phase depended drug.  [22 -24] However, 
decitabine is usually administered  in one hour daily infusions  during 3  to 5 consecutive 
days (too short to expose decitabine to most AM L blasts  during at least 2 cycles of 
replication , which divide every 2  to 7 days). [25-27]  Recent experience with increasing  the 
number of infusion s per cycle from 5 consecutive days to 10 consecutive days has 
improved overall response rates to 67%. [3] Response to decitabine can be slow, sometimes 
requiring 3  to 5 cycles before maximum response is observed. [2] As a consequence, many 
patients are exposed to prolonged therapy, gaining little benefit, before determining 
resistance. There are currently no biomarkers that predict response t o decitabine.  
 
Decitabine is a cytosine analogue that cannot be methylated. Incorporation of decitabine 
into DNA prevents DNA methylation at cytosine residues and derepresses epi[INVESTIGATOR_295736]. Therefore, the reduction in total genomi c DNA methylcytosine 
content acts as a marker of effective decitabine dosing. Indeed, two groups have recently 
correlated effective methylcytosine reduction and gene expression derepression to 
response  (Figure 1.1) .[3, 28] 
 
  
   
Figure 1.1. From Shen et al JCO (2010) 28:611 and Blum et al JCO (2007) 25: [ADDRESS_361168] recently  used whole genome sequencing to identify  recurrent, somatic 
mutations in AML and MDS patients in four genes that are involved in methylcytosine 
regulation: DNMT3A, IDH1, IDH2, and TET2. [29-37] Collectively, nearly half of all 
AML/MDS patients have a mutation in one of these four genes.  DNMT3A mutations are 
associated with an adverse outcome in AML patients trea ted with cytotoxic 
chemotherapy. [35, 38] However, it is not yet clear whether the presence of mutations in 
one or more of these genes is ass ociated with response or resistance to decitabine.  
 
In this study, we will treat patients with the current state -of-the-art decitabine schedule. [3] 
We will perform exome sequencing on all patients and correlate response with mutation 
status, rate of mutat ion clearance , expression profile, serum decitabine levels , and DNA

Version date: 08/08/[ADDRESS_361169] share d mutations in many of the same genes , 
shared patterns of mutation acquisition, and shared patterns of mutation evolution .[39, 40] 
Furthermore, MDS, like AML, presents  with clonal hematopoiesis, even when the 
morphologic blast count is zero. [36]Because this study will identify and track the rate of 
clearance of patient specific mutations, and because decitabine has been shown to have 
efficacy in both AML and MDS patients,  [2, 3, 16 -19, 41 -45] combining analysis of AML 
and MDS patients is reasonable.   Asymptomatic MDS patients are excluded because these 
patients are typi[INVESTIGATOR_295737] -waiting rather  than with chemotherapy.  
  
1.2 Decitabine  and Hypomethylating agents in AML /MDS  
 
Methylation of cytosine in the CpG dinucleotide by [CONTACT_295781] a 
significant mechanism for the loss of tumor suppressor gene expression in human cancer, 
including AML  and MDS .[46, 47] Like azacitidine , decitabine  (5-aza-2’-deoxycitidine) is 
incorporated into DNA  during S phase and forms covalent adducts with DNA 
methyltransferase. The irreversible inhibition of this enzyme results in loss of methylation 
and is associated with differentiation. [48]  Decitabine is an approximately [ADDRESS_361170] at higher doses  (1-2 µM) .[49]  
 
Decitabine has been investigated in hematologic malignancies using a range of doses and 
schedules.  It is currently FDA approved for the treatment of adults with MDS at a dose of 
15 mg/m2 every 8 hours for 3 days, based on a Phase III study that demonstrated improved 
outcomes in the treatment arm compared to patients treated with supportive care alone. [15]  
However, the overall response rate  in this trial w as modest ( 17%). Of note, 18% of the 
patients in th is trial had 20 -30% bone marrow blasts, meeting the current WHO criteria for 
AML.  Subsequent p hase I and II studies in AML, using a variety of low -dose decitabine 
regimens, have reporte d overall response rates of 22 -49%.[2, 3, 16 -19, 41 -45] Comparisons 
of multiple low dose schedules have no ted improved efficacy in the MDS population using 
a dose of 20 mg/m2 on Days 1 -5 of a 28 -day cycle. [50, 51 ] Because of these results, we 
have recently explored this dosing schedule in the treatment of elderly patients with 
AML. [52] In this study, we observe d an overall response rate of 24 %, and an additional  
44% of patients achiev ed stable disease dur ing a median of 5 monthly cycles. [48] In this 
study, we noted that decitabine  does not act quickly and the median time to resp onse was 
3 months. These results are similar to the recently published experience in [LOCATION_013] 
treating 227 patients with 15 mg/m2 over 3 hours TID for 3 days every 6 weeks, which 
resulted in a CR/PR rate of 26%. [16]

13 A recent study using a prolonged administration schedule (20 mg/m2 IV over 1 hour on 
consecutive days 1 -10) showed improved  response (64 % CR/PR) and improved time to 
respond (50% of patients had bone marrow blasts < 5% after 1 cycle of therapy). [3]  These 
results are an improvement over previous experience by [CONTACT_295782], and this experience is

In general, decitabine  is well tolerated. Unlike conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy, 
decitabine  can be administered in the outpatient setting. However, AML  and MDS are  
aggressive hematologic malignanc ies. Cy topenias commonly result from AML /MDS  
inhibition of normal hematopoies is, and often do not resolve until a complete response is 
achieved. Thus, neutropenic sepsis and thrombocytopenic bleeding remain significant  
problems regardless  of therapy, especially during the first 4 -8 weeks. In our experience 
treating elderly AML pati ents, neutropenia occurred in 24%, sepsis in 9% , and bacteremia 
in 7%.  Similar results have been observed in MDS patients. [20, 53, 54 ] As a result, death 
is not uncommon in the first 8 weeks of therapy, occurring in 15 -17% of patients, and most 
commonly res ulting from infection  and cytope nias related to disease and the rapy.[16, 52, 
55] While unsettling, these numbers are better t han many historical patients  treated with 
cytotoxic chemotherapy , and suggest a need for continued improvements in therapy .[9, 12]

1.2.1 Pharmacokinetics and Metabol ism of Decitabine  
 
In human subjects , after IV administration, decitabine displayed a distribution phase 
with a half -life of 7 minutes and a terminal phase elimination half -life of 10-35 
minutes as measured by [CONTACT_295783]. [56, 57]   The short plasma half -life is due to rapid 
inacti vation of decitabine by [CONTACT_295784]. [23] Total 
body clearance (Cl p) in humans was high with a mean value of 126 mL/min/kg. [58]  
 
Among five adult patients with advanced solid tumors administered seven courses 
of 100 mg/m2 of decitabine by 1 -hour infusions, [56] maximum plasma 
concentration ranged from [ADDRESS_361174] infusion 
and a slower decline over the next two hours to 6 nM, the level of detectabilit y. 
Plasma half -life (mean SE) was estimated to be approximately 7 1 minutes in the 
initial phase (t ½α) and 355 minutes in the second phase (t ½β). The area under the 
plasma concentration -time curve was 408 88 ng.hour/mL for these patients, with a 
peak plas ma concentration of 2.01 0.44 µM (0.440.1 µg/mL), while mean volume 
of distribution (Vd ss) and CLp was 4.59 1.42 L/kg and 126 21 mL/min/kg, 
respectively. The time course of DAC concentrations was similar in 1 of 2 patients 
administered 75 mg/m2, while DAC  was usually undetectable in the plasma of 
patients administered 25 to 60 mg/m2. 
 
Using a longer infusion time (up to 40 hours), Rivard et al. [57] reported a plasma 
concentration of 0.1 to 0.4 g/mL. With infusion times of 40 -60 hours, at an infusion 
rate of 1 mg/kg/h, plasma concentrations of 0.43 -0.76 µg/mL were achieved. [59]  The 
steady -state plasma concentration at an infusion rate of 1  mg/kg/h was estimated to 
be 0.2 -0.5 µg/mL. The half -life after discontinuing the infusion was 12 -20 min.[57]  
 
Urinary excretion of unchanged decitabine was low, ranging from less than 0.01% to 
0.9% of the total dose, and there was no relationship between excretion and dose or 
plasma drug levels. High clearance va lues and a total urinary excretion of <1% of the 
administered dose suggest that decitabine is eliminated rapi[INVESTIGATOR_295738], including extrahepatic metabolism. [60] 
 
The steady state plasma concentrations (C ss) ranged from 0.31 to 0.39 µg/mL (1.27 
to 1.60 µM) during the infusion  of 100 mg/m² decitabine over a 6 -hour period. [61] 
The range of concentrations during a 600 mg/m2 infusion over an 8-hour period  was 
0.41-16 g/mL (1.68 to 4.76 µM). [60] These plasma concentrations are in the same 
range as the in vitro concentrations that activated the expression of tumor 
suppressor gene p16 in three human non -small -cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell 
lines. [61]  
 
Steady state decitabine levels of 0.1 to 0.2 µM were achieved in solid tumor patients 
dosed with 30 mg/m²/day and 40 mg/m²/day by [CONTACT_295836] 72 hours. [62]

In our experience  treating primary patient blasts in vitro , concentrations of 100 – 
500 nM are required maximize methylcytosine reduction without causing cellular 
toxicity. Because decitabine incorporation into DNA is S -phase dependent, 
exposure of cells during cell divisi on is necessary for efficacy.  
  
 
 
 
1.2.2 Experience with  extended dosing schedules  
 
Blum et al recently published their experience treating  elderly AML patients with 
a 10-day course of decitabine 20 mg/m2/day as a 1 -hour infusion .[3] This prolonged 
exposure course was designed to incre ase the number of AML blast divisions 
exposed to decitabine per cycle. Toxicities were very similar to a similar regiment 
given as a 3 and 5 day course ,[2, 16]  but the overal l response (CR/PR) was much 
improved (64 % vs 25%). In all three  studies, the toxicities were primarily myeloid 
suppression and the resultant infectious and bleeding complications associated  with 
leukemic and pharmacologic hematopoietic suppression. Furthermore, Blum et al 
noted that the percent methylcytosine reduction was improved (22% vs 11%) as 
 
Genomic Predictors of Decitabine Response in AML/MDS  
 
Version date: 08/08/[ADDRESS_361175] clearance (50% of patients who ultimately achieved a CR had 
≤ 5% bone mar row blasts after 1 cycle vs 0% of patients after 2 cycles). Finally, 
like Shen et al, they observed a correlation between the extent of methylcytosine 
reduction and response. [28]  This study suggests t hat improvement in response 
rates and time to response can be achieved by [CONTACT_295785]. Further, that DNA methylcytosine reduction can be achieved with 
prolonged exposure to decitabine and that this might be a patient -specific biological 
marker of adequate  dosing.  
  
Scandura et al. recently published a study of infusional decitabine prior to 
cytarabine + daunorubicin induction therapy for AML. [64] They escalated the 
duration of infusio nal therapy and reached their planned goal of 20 mg/m2/day x 7 
days of continuous therapy given prior to cytarabine and daunorubicin. They noted 
similar toxicities (primarily hematopoietic and the associated neutropenic 
infections) , but that these were not  different from their experience giving cytarabine 
+ daunorubicin alone.  
 
1.3 Correlative Studies  
 
The goals of the correlative studies include:  
 
1. To correlate p atient -specific mutations  with response to decitabine . 
We will perform exome sequencing of each patient’s Day 0 bone marrow sample and 
skin sample. We will determine AML/MDS -associated variants found in the bone 
marrow, but not skin sample. We will correlate the presence of mutations with response 
(especially mutations in DNMT3A,  IDH1, IDH2, and TET2 ). This study is powered to 
identify mutations with >80% sensitivity to predict decitabine response if used as a 
clinical assay.  
 
2. To correlate the v elocity and depth of response  with response to decitabine . 
We will assess tumor burden by [CONTACT_295786] -specific mutations in bone 
marrow samp les collected on day 0, 10 ±1, 28±4 , and 56±[ADDRESS_361176] 24 recurrently mutated genes (including, but not limited to: FLT3, DNMT3A, 
NPM1, TET 2, WT1, IDH1, IDH2, RUNX1, NRAS, TP53, U2AF1, KRAS, PHF6, 
MSTP9, PTPN11, KIT, SMC3, PRUNE2, ETV6, CEBPA, SMC1A, ASXL1, STAG2, 
RAD21 ) as well as all patient -specific mutations discovered during exome sequencing. 
The leukemic allele frequency will be measure d using the Illumnia MySeq or HiSeq 
platform using DNA capture by [CONTACT_295825] -oligonucleotides. Patient 
bone marrow samples will be assessed on day 0, day 10 ± 1 , and day 28 ± 4 of cycle 1, 
and day 28 ± 4 of cycle 2 and compared with patient  specific skin samples (normal 
control). The velocity of response will be calculated as the natural log rate of patient -
specific mutation allele frequency clearance. Depth of response will be defined as the 
lowest patient -specific mutation allele frequency  in a bone marrow sample. The 
velocity and depth of tumor response will be correlated to:  
 Achievement of clinical CR,  
 Time to best response,

Version date: 08/08/12  
17  Mutational status,  
 Time to disease progression.  
Because all patient -specific exome -discovered mutations will be ass essed a second 
time in the primary bone marrow sample as well as the Day 10 ± 1, 28 ± 4, and 56 ± 4 
bone marrow samples, t his study will also serve to validate all exome -discovered 
mutations. This is important, because exome sequencing is associated with a  20-50% 
false -discovery rate depending on type I error tolerated  (mutation -calling algorithms 
are typi[INVESTIGATOR_295773]) .  Thus, many mutations 
discovered during exome sequencing are incorrect.  This second analysis of thes e 
mutations will server to exclude these false positive calls.  
 
3. To correlate the bone marrow e xpression profile  on Day 0 and Day 10 ± 1 with response 
to decitabine . 
We will correlate expression signatures, and changes in expression signatures, with : 
 Achievement of clinical CR,  
 Mutation status . 
 
4. To correlate steady -state serum decitabine concentration on Day 4 ± 1 with:  
 Achievement of CR.  
 
5. To correlate the extent of b one marrow DNA hypomethylation  on Day 10 ± 1 with 
response to decitabine . 
We will assess the percent reduction in bone marrow methylcytosine content using LC -
MS. Patients will be evaluated on Day 0 and Day 10 ± 1 of Cycle 1. The change in 
DNA methylcytosine content will be correlated to:  
 Achievement of clinical CR,  
 Change in exp ression signature .

promyelocytic leukemia. AML patients who are < [ADDRESS_361184] not received 
cytotoxic induction chemotherapy are also excluded , because cytotoxic therapy offers a 
curative possibility for these patients.  MDS patients without cytopenias are also excluded 
because these patients can be followed with watchful -waiting . 
 
All patients will undergo bone marrow biopsies prior to therapy, on Day 10 ± 1, and on 
Day 28 ± 4 of Cycles 1 and 2 for comprehensive genomic correlative studies. Patients will 
also provide peripheral blood samples on Day 4 ± 1 for pharmacokinetic studies.  
 
Patients will receive decitabine 20 mg/m2/day as a 1 -hour infusion on consecutive Days 1 -
10 in 28 -day cycles.   The dose will be calculated based on actual patient weight at the 
beginning of each cycle.  
 
After 2 cycles, if  patients achieve CRi, the admini stration of decitabine will be decreased 
to 5 days. After two cycles with CRi and no evidence of disease by [CONTACT_295832], patients will further decrease therapy 3 consecutive days.   The dose of 
decitabine will remain 20 mg/m2/day over 1 hour regardless of decreases in the number of 
days per cycle of administration.  
 
Patients who achieve stable disease, partial response , or complete response will continue 
on decitabine therapy  (receiving cycles of 3 -10 days every 28 days  (i.e., Days 1 -10, Days

27 6.0 DOSE MODIFICATIONS  
 
6.1 Delay for Cytopenia or Infection  
 
As cytopenias are a defining feature of AML  and MDS , their presence alone does not 
generally warrant dose modifications or delays. Patients will receive four cycles of therapy 
without adjustment for any cytopenia.  
 
Patients with febrile neutropenia (temperature ≥ 38.5° with ANC < 1,000/ l) or systemic 
infections should have treatment held until clinical resolution of the infec tion. A patient 
will meet criterion for discontinuation of the study if the patient is observed to have a delay 
of > 8 weeks between any two cycles.  
 
6.2 Delay for Organ Dysfunction  
 
If ren al dysfunction (creatinine ≥ 3  X institutional upper limit of normal) or hepatic 
dysfunction ( bilirubin ≥ 2.5  mg/dl or ALT/AST ≥ 3 X institutional upper limit of normal)  
occurs, therapy may not resume until the abnormalities have resolved to below the limits 
stated above. If renal or hepatic dysfunction occurs during  a treat ment course, the next dose 
of decitabine should be held, and serum chemistries should be checked twice per week.  
Decitabine can be resumed when creatinine, bilirubin, ALT and AST are below the limits 
listed above.  
 
For grade 3 -4 non -hematologic toxicitie s, decitabine treatment should be delayed until 
recovery to baseline or to grade ≤ 1. For toxicities felt to be related to decitabine, decitabine 
may be reintroduced with a 50% dose reduction, or at the discretion of the investigator.  
 
6.3 Modification in Dose  or Schedule  
 
Once patients achieve morphologic complete remission with incomplete blood count 
recovery (CRi)  (morphologic leukemia -free state, defined as less than 5% blasts in aspi[INVESTIGATOR_295774] a count of  ≥ 200 nucleated cells and no bla sts with Auer rods, 
any persistence of extramedullary disease, or persistent pre -treatment morphologic 
abnormalities, such as pseudo -Pelger -Hüet cells, ringed sideroblasts, or dysplastic 
megakaryocytes) , administration may be decreased to [ADDRESS_361195] 
counts < 5% and no evidence of disease by [CONTACT_295827], patients 
may further decrease therapy to 3 consecutive days per cycle, per trea ting physician . 
 
Genomic Predictors of Decitabine Response in AML/MDS  
 
Version date: 08/08/[ADDRESS_361196] by [CONTACT_295804], a major mechanism for gene expression. In some cancer cells, 
hypermethylation blocks the activity of tumor suppressor genes, which regulate cell 
division and differentiation to prevent malignant transformation. When suppressor g ene 
activity is blocked, cell division becomes unregulated, leading to the formation of 
neoplastic cells. Decitabine regulates DNA methylation (specifically targets the 
methyltransferase , DNMT1 ), effectively demethylating and reactivating different tumor 
suppressor genes. Because hypermethylation occurs early in the malignant transformation 
of cells, decitabine may have activity in chemoprevention. Other possible mechanisms for 
decitabine activity include cytotoxicity due to incorporation into DNA similar t o other 
antimetabolites, methylation -independent induction of gene expression, and degradation of 
DNA methyltransferase 1.

Bone marrow samples  will be collected at Baseline, on Cycle 1 Day 10 ± 1 , and on Day 28  ± 4 of 
Cycle 1 and of even number cycles for correlative studies. Bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337] (6 -10 ml) will be 
collected and divided between two EDTA (lavender top) tubes. The bone marrow samples and 
peripheral blood  samples should be delivered by [CONTACT_295833] , M.D. PhD, director

31 9.0 EFFICACY, SAFETY AND CORRELATIVE STUDY MEASURES  
 
A secondary  endpoint of this study is to estimate morphologic complete remission rate.  
  
9.1 Response Criteria  
 
Patients will be assessed for response according to the IWG criteria:1  
 
Morphologic complete remission  (CR)  – Defined as morphologic leukemia -free state, 
defined as less than 5% blasts in aspi[INVESTIGATOR_295740] a count of ≥200 
nucleated cells and no blasts with Auer rods or any persis tence of extramedullary disease. 
When erythroid precursors constitute less than 50% of bone marrow nucleated cells, the 
percentage  of blasts is based on all nucleated cells; when there are 50% or more erythroid 
cells, the percentage blasts should be based on the nonerythroid cells. The presence of mild 
megaloblastoid changes may be permitted if they are thought to be consistent with 
treatment effect. However, persistence of pretreatment abnormalities (eg, pseudo -Pelger -
Hüet cells, ringed sideroblasts, dysplastic megakaryocytes) are not consistent with CR.   In 
addition, ANC >1000/μl and platelet count of ≥100,000/μl. Patient must be in dependent of 
transfusions. No duration requirement for this designation.  
 
Cytogenetic complete remission (CCR) – Defined as morphologic complete remission plus 
a reversion to a normal karyotype. For this study, reversion of a normal karyotype is 
defined as  no clonal abnormalities detected in a minimum of 20 mitotic cells.  
 
Morphologic complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery  (CRi)  – Defined as 
morphologic complete recovery with the exception of neutropenia <1000/μl or 
thrombocytopenia <100,00 0/μl.  
 
Partial remission  (PR) – Requires that the above criteria for complete remission be met, 
with the following exceptions: decrease of ≥50% in the percentage of blast to 5 -25% in the 
bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337]. A value of 5% blasts in bone marrow with Auer  rods present may 
also be considered a partial remission.  
 
Treatment failure – Includes all patients who did not achieve a complete or partial 
remission  following 4 cycles of therapy .  
 
Recurrence/morphologic relapse  - Relapse following complete remission  is defined as 
reappearance of blasts in the blood or the finding of ≥5% blasts in the bone marrow, not 
attributable to any other cause. New dysplastic changes are considered a relapse. If there 
are no blasts in the peripheral blood and 5 -20% blasts in the  bone marrow, bone marrow 
biopsy should be repeated in > 1 week to confirm relapse.

32 9.2 Guidelines for Evaluation of Disease  
 
Bone marrow biopsy should be performed at baseline for both the correlative  study and 
clinical  evaluation. Bone marrow biopsy should  be performed on Day 28  ± 4 of cycle 1  
and on Day 28 ± [ADDRESS_361199] count, typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] a 
greater than 50% incre ase compared with baseline. Patients with progressive disease  will 
be removed from the study.  
 
Patients may also be removed from the study for progressive disease base d on evidence of 
new extramedullary disease or based on the clinical  judgment  of the treating physician . 
 
Patient s with a > 50% increase in peripheral blast count with an increase of the total 
peripheral white blood cell count to > 10,000/ l should undergo evaluation by [CONTACT_295834].

12.2 Statistical Analysis  
 
12.2.1  Descriptive Analyses  
 
Patient Disposition : The number of patients discontinued, the reasons for 
discontinuation, and the number of cycles administered will be summarized.  
 
Demographics and Baseline Characteristics : Descriptive summary statistics will 
be provided for demographic and important baseline characteristics.  For 
continuous variables, the number of patients, mean, standard deviation, median, 
minimum and maximum will be provided.  Fo r categorical variables, the number 
and percent of patients in each demographic/characteristic category will be 
summarized.  
 
12.2.2  Primary Endpoint Analysis  
 
The primary end -point of this phase II study is the correlation biomarkers with 
overall response in AML/ MDS patients to decitabine.  
 
We will correlate the presence of patient specific mutations  (especially mutations  
in DNMT3A, IDH1, IDH2, and TET2 ) with overall response rates. Mutation rates 
in these genes and in other patient -specific genes will be correlat ed with overall 
response and t heir respective 95% confidence intervals will be provided.  
 
Statistical considerations. The relationship between AML/MDS -associated 
mutations and the responsiveness to decitabine will be described by [CONTACT_295837] -square test or Fisher’s exact test as appropriate. The 
differentially expressed genes between responders and non -responders will be 
determined using the significance analysis of microarray (SAM). Multivariate 
logistic regression will also b e fit to adjust the potential confounding effects of other 
demographic and clinical characteristics. The resultant critical P values will be 
corrected for multiple testing.  Since the Bonferroni correction is known too 
conservative, a permutation analysis (e.g., 10,000 random assignments for 
Genomic Predictors of Decitabine Response in AML/MDS  
 
Version date: 08/08/12  
39 responsive status) will be used to derive an empi[INVESTIGATOR_295745] P value.  The new 
critical p -value is the number of permutation tests which yield a lower p -value than 
the original test divided by [CONTACT_295838]. [61]   
 
A power analysis was performed using Chi -square test for the association between 
mutation and response to decitabine. The frequency of DNMT3A, IDH1/2, and 
TET2 mutations in AML and MDS patients are each between 15% and 30% in 
multiple cohorts. [29-37] Table 3  shows the minimal detectable differences of 
response rates between mutant and wild -type cases, assuming an expected overall 
45% CR/CRi rate and 80% power. For an average of 20% frequency of a mutated 
gene, for example, 100 patients will provide 80% power to detect 30% difference 
at a [ADDRESS_361205] 
30% of clinical response 
could be attributed to the 
presence of a specific 
mutation. However, we 
anticipate that more power 
could be achieved as we 
assess patient groups with 
combined characteristics 
(e.g. DNMT3A mutation or 
loss of DNMT3A expression). 
In addition, we expect that 
the majority of the enrolled 
125 patients can be used in the analysis (since all of our molecular information will 
be acquired within 30 days of enrollment, we anticipate a drop -out rate of 20% or 
less).  
 
12.2.3  Secondary Endpoint Analyses  
 
The overall response rate (CR/CRi/PR) and complete response rate (CR/CRi) will 
be compared with historical controls [2], and the 95% confidence intervals will be 
provided.  
 
The rate of patient spe cific mutation clearance after 10, 30, and 60  days of therapy 
will be determined using an Illumina bas ed platform. We will compare the rate of 
mutation clearance between the patients who achieve a CR/CRi after 4 cycles and 
those who do not.  We anticipate that we will identify between 6 and 25 exonic 
SNVs per case (the range obtained with >200 AML samples s equenced to date with 
whole genome or exome sequencing), and that the expected 95% confidence Table 3 . Detectable mutation associated response rates  (80% power, α = 0.05)

40 interval of the mean variant allele frequency will be ±2.56% and ±1.25%, 
respectively, if we assume an anticipated standard deviation of 3.2% within the 
same clon e. The change of tumor burden over time and its association with clinical 
response will  be assessed using [ADDRESS_361206] ANOVA for repeated measurement data, 
followed by [CONTACT_295799] -hoc multiple comparisons for between -group differences (e.g., 
responders vs. non -respon ders) at given time points as well as the between -time 
differences within each group. The resultant critical P values will also be corrected 
using permutation analysis for multiple testing.  
 
The steady -state serum decitabine concentration on day 4 ± 1 will  be measured and 
correlated with clinical overall response.  
 
The percent decrease in peripheral blood methylcytosine will be calculated on day 
10±1. We will compare this reduction with previously published data and between 
the patients who achieve CR/CRi a nd those who do not.  The correlation of peak 
serum levels with response will be assessed using [ADDRESS_361207] ANOVA for repeated 
measurement data, followed by [CONTACT_295799] -hoc multiple comparisons for between -group 
differences (e.g., responders vs. non -responders) and between -time differ ences. 
Similar analyses will be performed for the correlation of expression profiles and 
SNP analysis with pharmacokinetic data.   
 
Statistical power justification.   A power analysis was performed using two -sample 
t-test for between -group difference and paired t -test for the change over time. For 
tumor clearance, this will provide > 99% power to detect a 10% difference in the 
means at two separate time points for clo nes with 6 or more variants, and > 98% 
power to detect a 15% difference if there are 3 or more variants per clone with α = 
0.05 (power will decrease to 91% and 82%, respectively, in cases where the 
standard deviation is 4.7%, the maximum we have observe d thus far). For 
pharmacologic correlations, we anticipate 85% power to determine a 25 ng/ml 
difference between the average C max of 45 evaluable responders and 55 evaluable 
non-responders with an anticipated average C max of 70 ng/ml and a standard 
deviation o f 40 ng/ml within the entire cohort, and with α = 0.05. [22] We believe a 
less significant difference would n ot be sufficient to warrant application in clinical 
decision making (i.e. whether to continue therapy for more than 1 cycle). We 
anticipate 99% power to determine a difference of 20% in the reduction of bone 
marrow methylcytosine between [ADDRESS_361208] deviation of 15% and α = 0.05. [28, 66-68] 
The difference in methylcytosine reduction previously observed was 30% between 
patients achieving CR/PR and those  with only hematologic improvement. [28]  
 
Time to relapse and time to death will also be listed for each patient.

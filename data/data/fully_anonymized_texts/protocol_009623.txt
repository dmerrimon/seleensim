Statistical analysis plan  
     The primary outcome is total time (minutes) to successful epi[INVESTIGATOR_41835], defined as 
the sum of the ultrasound or palpation time, plus the epi[INVESTIGATOR_567399]. The present 
study focused on the morbidly obese population (BMI ≥ 40), of which we are unaware of any available 
data to guide a calculation for the primary outcome. Based on pi[INVESTIGATOR_567400], total 
sample size will be calculated with 80% power to detect a six -minute differen ce in time -to-placement 
between groups with an alpha of 0.05 (two -tailed).  
     Distribution normality of continuous data will be examined using box plots and histograms. Non -
normally distributed data will be compared using the Kruskal -Wallis H test, and c ontinuous data 
compared with the Mann -Whitney U test. Normally distributed continuous variables will be compared 
using the independent sample Student t -test. The Fisher Exact test will be used for categorical variables. 
A P-value of ≤ 0.05 will be consider ed statistically significant.

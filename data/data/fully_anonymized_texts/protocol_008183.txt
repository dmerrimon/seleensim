REV: 1.[ADDRESS_293974] -operative care 
and other thera peutic procedures.  Through early detection and improved hemodynamic monitoring, 
optimization of fluid balance, anesth esia titration, and augmenting other acute care management 
requirements, a clinician should be able to improve overall patient stability, minimize complications, 
diminish surgical trauma and reduce recovery time.  
Current methods for acutely monitoring blood volume and blood loss include monitoring of vital signs 
(such as heart rate, blood pressure respi[INVESTIGATOR_1520], and oxygen saturation), invasive central venous (right 
heart central venous pressure measurement and swan  ganz pulmonary capi[INVESTIGATOR_242264]) , and arterial catheters designed to monitor hemodynamic status centrally.  Vital sign 
monitoring may not indicate small amounts of acute blood loss and arterial and venous cannulations can 
create inser tion complications such as perforations in the vasculature, pneumothorax, arrhythmias, 
thrombosis and infection.  While invasive central monitoring may provide extremely accurate 
information, changes may not be good indicators of early central hypovolemia or with smaller blood 
volume reductions1-2.   
The Zynex Monitoring Solutions  fluid volume monitor , Model 1500 (CM -1500), uses a relative patient 
standard approach by [CONTACT_105] -invasively and simultaneously monitoring five (5) physiological parameters, 
including bioelectrical impedance, electrocardiogram (ECG)  amplitude, photoplethysmogram (PPG) 
amplitude, heart rate, and skin temperature . The CM -1500 starts by [CONTACT_40397] a baseline for each patient 
in a normal state.  When the monitoring session starts, each patient starts with a Relative Index of 100, 
signifying the collection of parameters near their original  baseline value(s). The Relative Index value acts 
as a combinational score for all the parameters indicative of relative fluid change.   
Hemodialysis is a  medical procedure performed to remove fluid and waste products from the blood and 
to correct electrolyte imbalances.   Patients with chronic kidney failure often need to undergo 
hemodialysis multiple times each week to prevent fluid overload. The environment in which 
hemodialysis is performed is well-defined , and the amount of fluid volume removed during each session 
is calculated and recorded.  Therefore, examining  changes in the RI in hemodialysis procedures  will 
provide valuable insights  into the performance of the RI in comparison to the  individual  parameters that 
make up the index , as well as the observed changes that may occur in a patient’s physical status during a 
hemodialysis session.

1.1 CLINICAL RATIONALE  
The proposed clinical study is designed characterize the changes in the Zynex  non-invasive monitoring 
device (CM -1500)  Relative Index  to track fluid volume changes in subjects  consented to undergo a 
hemodialysis procedure .  An initial feasibility was conducted (n=12 subjects) to confirm that the CM -
[ADDRESS_293975]’s study participation is estimated to last 
approximately 1-[ADDRESS_293976] has not completed three (3) 
monitoring sessions within [ADDRESS_293977] prescribed treatment plan .  Subjects will consent to  undergo non -invasive monitoring with the 
CM-1500 during three (3) separate hemodialysis sessions.   Attempts will be made to have the monitoring 
sessions sequentially performed with their subsequently planned hemodialysis sessions.  Up to 20 
subjects will be consented and enrolled to ensure 15 subjects complete the study  with the required 
number of monitoring sessions.   
3 STUDY  DEVICE   
3.1 DEVICE DESCRIPTION  
The CM -1500 is a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) cleared non -invasive monitoring device that 
simultaneously monitors five (5) parameters of a patient’s body. Parameters include bioelectrical 
impedance, heart rate, ECG amplitude, PPG amplitude, and skin temperature. A combination of these 
parameters is represented by a single number known as the Relative Index value. This value is indicative 
of relative changes in fluid volume.  The Relative Index is a unique functionality of the Zynex CM -1500.  
 CLINICAL PROTOCOL  SPONSOR:  ZMS  
PROTOCOL:  ZMS -1500 -2021 -Dialysis  
    
 
REV: 1.0 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 10 of 24 
 
3.1.1 DEVICE DESIGN AND COMPONENTS  
The CM -1500 is an all -inclusive device that includes the following components: display monitor (1), power 
supply (1), trunk cable (1), wrist cuff with attached PPG finger glove (1), wrist strap (1), and electrode array 
set (2). The wrist cuff with attached  PPG finger glove may be cleaned and reused. The wrist strap is single -
subject use. The electrode array sets are single -use, single -subject.  
3.2 PRINCIPLES OF OPERATION  
The CM -1500 measures bioelectrical impedance (ohms), heart rate (BPM), ECG amplitude, PPG amplitude, 
and skin temperature (◦C or ◦F). As parameters change, towards indications of fluid change/imbalance, the 
Relative Index, which acts as a combinational score of percent change values for all of the parameters,  
will compound these changes into a singular value to signify overall fluid changes/imbalances within the 
patient’s body. When the monitoring session starts, every patient will start with a Relative Index of 100, 
signifying the combination of physiological  parameters is near or at their original baseline values for all 
five monitor ed parameters. All parameters are continuously measured and tracked during a monitoring 
session.  
3.3 INDICATIONS FOR USE  
Per the device’s FDA clearance, the CM -1500 is indicated for monitoring bioelectrical impedance, heart 
rate, ECG amplitude, and PPG amplitude and their relative changes, indicative of relative changes in fluid 
volume in adult patients.  
3.4 INTENDED USE  
Per the device’s FDA clearance, the CM -[ADDRESS_293978] knowledge of the system and data 
interpretation obtained via medical education, system documentation, and specific courses. The  device 
does not report any diagnosis but provides numerical values; it is ultimately the physician’s responsibility 
to make proper diagnosis and judgments based on these values.

8.1.2 SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT (SAE)   
An SAE  is defined a s an AE  that meets any of the following criteria: Fatal or life -threat ening*; requires or 
prolongs in -subject hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] **; results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity ; congenital 
anomaly/birth defect; important medical event. An event’s  severity  grading , action (s) taken , relationship 
to the hemodialysis  or study procedure , and the outcome  will all be used for SAE’s.  
*Life-threatening is defined as an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event. 
It does not refer to an event that hypothetically may have caused death if it was more severe.  
**In-subject hospi[INVESTIGATOR_242270], even  if released on the same day  or an emergency room visit , which results in admission 
to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. Emergency room visits that do not result in admission to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_242271] . 
8.1.[ADDRESS_293997] (UADE)   
An unanticipated adverse device  effect is d efined by  [ADDRESS_293998], 
problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the 
investigational plan or application (including supplementary plan or application, or any other 
unanticipated serious problem associated with the device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of 
subjects . The Investigator  or designee  will indicate if they believe an event was an unanticipated adverse 
device effect on the case repo rt form, and the Sponsor will evaluate for reporting requirements defined 
below.  
8.[ADDRESS_293999] study completion.  
Investigators shall submit to the Sponsor a report of any AE’s or SAE’s that occur during the study within 
five ( 5) working days but no later than  ten ( 10) days after the Investigator learns of the event.  
Investigator s shall submit to the Sponsor and to the reviewing IRB a report of any UADE (s) that occur 
during the study as soon as possible but no later than  five (5)  working  days after the Investigator learns 
of the effect . Sponsors  will evaluate UADE’s . 
8.2.1 REPORTING EVENTS  & SAFETY CONTACTS  
Events will be reported, in writing, to the Sponsor as soon as possible but no later than  five ( 5) working 
days after the Investigator learns of the event. In an event resulting in the death of the subject, the event 
will be reported within 24 -hours of knowledge of the event. The Sponsor is responsible for fulfilling IRB 
and regulatory reporting requirements.

9 STATISTICAL METHODS AND CONSIDERATIONS  
9.1 SAMPLE SIZE DETERMINATION  
This is a hypothesis generating study; therefore, hypothesis testing will not be performed. The sample size 
of [ADDRESS_294003] deviation (SD), median, quartiles, minimum, maximum and 
number of observations. Categorical variables will be summarized in terms of the number of subjects 
providing data, fre quency count and percentage.  
9.4 DEMOGRAPHIC AND BASELINE CHARACTERISTICS  
All demographic and baseline variables collected at enrollment will be summarized  using descriptive 
statistics .

PROTOCOL:  ZMS -1500 -2021 -Dialysis  
    
 
REV: 1.[ADDRESS_294004] outcomes and conditions that present during the 
hemodialysis sessions. Baseline performance of the CM -1500 device will be set in the Relative Index 
before the hemodialysis sessions.   The primary analysis will utilize the descriptive statistics to characterize 
the changes in the CM -1500 Relative Index during the hemodialysis sessions, comparing to the basel ine 
values. The analysis, however, can include investigation into individual vital sign parameters that the CM -
1500 device (or another source) produces during a subject’s session or [ADDRESS_294005] (between subject) and intra -subject (within -subject) 
variability in the Relative Index changes across multiple hemodialysis sessions will be estimated using the 
variance component analysis through a random effects model that includes only subject and hemodialysis 
session as random effects. The variance and % coefficient of variation (%CV) will be co mputed for the 
components of between -subject and within -subject through the model.   
[ADDRESS_294006]. In some instances , 
case report forms (CRFs)  will serve as source documentation. The Investigator or designated study 
personnel will provide the Sponsor redacted post -treatment forms  with the corresponding subject ID 
number  for each of  the hemodialysis procedures . Any required data not collected as standard of care for 
the hemodialysis  procedure will be captured on study -specific paper case report forms.   
Corrections of data on paper CRFs  or source documents  will be made by [CONTACT_242281]. Each correction will be initialed and dated by [CONTACT_242282].  
The Investigator is responsible for the information collected on subjects enrolled in the study. All data 
collected during the study must be reviewed and verified for completeness and accuracy by [CONTACT_3786].  If any corrections are made after the Investigators signature, the Investigator will also initial 
and date the correction.  
10.1.[ADDRESS_294007] will be kept in a safe and  secure 
location; access to these records will be on a limited basis. Only the subject  identification number, gender ,

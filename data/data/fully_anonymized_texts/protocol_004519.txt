Study period (planned):
December 2016 to March 2018Clinical phase: 3
Objectives:
Prim ary:
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of SHP640 based on clinical resolution (d efined as 
absence of bulbar conjunctival injection and ocular conjunctival discharge) compared w ith placebo in the treatment 
of subjects with bacterial conjunctivitis in the study eye at Visit 3 (Day 5). 
Secondary:
The key secondary objective of this stud y is to evaluate the efficacy of SHP640 based on bacterial eradication 
(defined as absence of all bacterial species present at or above pathological threshold at baseline in the study eye) 
compared with placebo in the treatment of subjects w ith bacterial c onjunctivitis in the study eye at Visit 3 (Day 5).
Secondary objectives of this study are as follows:
To evaluate the effect of treatment in the study eye, for the follow ing endpoints :
Clinical resolution of bacterial conjunctivitis at Visits 2 (Day 3), 4 (Day 8) ,and 5 (Day 12)
Bacterial eradication at Visits 2 (Day 3), 4 (Day 8) ,and 5 (Day 12)
Absolute and change from baseline of the individual clinical signs (bulbar conjunctival injection and ocular 
conjunctival discharge) at Visits 2 (Day 3), 3 (Day 5) , 4 (Day 8) ,and 5 (Day 12)
The global clinical score (sum of bulbar conjunctival injection and ocular conjunctival discharge) and change 
from baseline in the global clinical score at Visits 2 (Day 3), 3 (Day 5), 4 (Day 8) ,and 5 (Day 12)
Modified clinical resolution, defined as a global clinical score of 0 or 1, at Visits 2 (Day 3), 3 (Day 5), 4 
(Day  8),and 5 (Day 12)
Expanded clinical resolution, defined as a global clinical score of 0, 1, or 2 w ith neither injection nor 
discharge having a score of 2 at Visits 2 (Day 3), 3 (Day 5), 4 (Day 8) ,and 5 (Day 12)
Time to clinical resolution based upon assessments at Visits 2 (Day 3), 3 (Day 5), 4 (Day 8) ,and 5 (Day 12)
To evaluate the safety and tolerability of SHP640, compared to PVP -I and placebo in the trea tment of subjects 
with bacterial conjunctivitis
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 13
Protocol SHP640 -303 27Sep 2016
Rationale:
The clinical presentation of conjunctivitis is often nonspecific ,and differential diagnosis of different types of 
conjunctivitis can be challenging ( Azari and Barney 2013; O’Brien et al. 2009). D iagnostic testing to differentiate 
the underlying cause of infection is rarely performed in a clinical setting; misdiagnosis can occur in up to 50% of 
cases, which often results in improper antibiotic treatment (Visscher et al. 2009). Incorrect treatment c an not only 
increase healthcare costs from unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions and repeat office visits but can also pose serious 
risks for people with certain viral and bacterial variants (eg, herpes simplex or methicillin -resistant Staphylococcus 
aureus ). In addition, there is also a risk of overuse and misuse of antibiotics, which are ineffective in the treatment 
of viral infections (Statham et al. 2008). An unmet medical need therefore exists for a safe and efficacious treatment 
that addresses both bac terial and adenoviral conjunctivitis, 2of the leading causes of acute infectious conjunctivitis. 
By [CONTACT_409481] -I, a potent topi[INVESTIGATOR_409453], with 
dexamethasone, a topi[INVESTIGATOR_27560], SHP640 will enable t he treatment of both the infectious and inflammatory 
components of adenoviral and bacterial conjunctivitis .
Investigational product, dose, and m ode of administration:
The drug product is SHP640 (0.1% dexamethasone and 0.6% PVP -I) ophthalmic suspension.
The comparators are placebo ophthalmic solution and 0.6% PVP -I ophthalmic solution.
Subjects will instill [ADDRESS_516358] in each eye 4 times daily (w ith a minimum of 2 hours between 
doses) for 7 days.
Methodology :
Once screening and basel ine assessments are complete and subjects are confirmed eligible to enroll in the study, 
subjects will be randomized, and investigational product w ill be administered on the same day (Day 1). The first 
dose w ill be administered by [CONTACT_409482] 1, and thereafter subjects w ill adm inister 1 drop in each eye 4 times a 
day for 7 days. Additional visits will occur on Days 3 (Visit 2), 5 (Visit 3), 8 (Visit 4), and 12 (Visit 5). The study 
will last up to 13 days. 
Inclusion and exclusion criteria:

BCVA
Slit lamp biomicroscopy 
Non-dilated/ dilated fundus examination
Urine p regnancy testing (for females of childbearing potential)
Adverse events (AEs)
Statistical Methods:
The analyses on primary, key secondary, secon dary,and exploratory efficacy endpoints will be performed on the 
modified intent -to-treat ( mITT )population. Additional sensitivity analyses may be conducted on the intent -to-treat 
(ITT)population. Safety analyses will be conducted on the safety population.
For both efficacy and safety analyses, baseline is defined as the assessments taken prior to treatment at Visit 1 (Day 
1).
Analys is Populations:
Thesafety population will include all subjects who receive at least 1dose of investigational product .
TheITT population will include all randomized subjects. 
The mITTpopulation consists of a subset of the ITT population who receive at least 1dose of investigational 
product and have a positive bacterial culture (presence of 1 or more bacterial species at o r above pathological 
threshold) at baseline in the study eye.
Designation of Study Eye:
The study eye for analyses will be defined as follows, where an eligible eye is an eye with a score of at least 1 for 
both ocular  conjunctival discharge and bulbar con junctival redness at baseline (baseline is defined as the 
assessments taken prior to treatment at Visit 1 [Day 1]):
For subjects w ith both eyes eligible and both with a positive bacterial culture (presence of 1 or more bacterial 
species at or above patholo gical threshold) at baseline or both eyes eligible and both with a non-positive 
bacterial culture (absence of any bacterial species at or above pathological threshold) at baseline, the study eye 
will be the eye with the highest global clinical score (sum o f bulbar conjunctival injection and ocular 
conjunctival discharge) at baseline. If both eyes have the same global clinical score at baseline, then the study 
eye will be the right eye.
For subjects w ith both eyes eligible with a positive bacterial culture i n one eye at baseline, the baseline bacterial 
culture positive eye will be the study eye.
For subjects w ith only 1eligible eye, the eligible eye will be the study eye irrespective of its baseline bacterial 
culture status.
Primary Efficacy Analyses:
All ef ficacy analyses will be performed on the mITT and presented by [CONTACT_6660]. There is a single primary 
comparison for the single primary endpoint. Therefore, no adjustment of multiplicity is needed for the hypothesis 
testing for the primary objective.
The primary efficacy endpoint of clinical resolution in the study eye at Visit 3 (Day 5) will be compared betw een the 
SHP640 and placebo group. The comparison will be based on the proportion of subjects with clinical resolution in 
the study eye at Visit 3 (Day  5) using Fisher’s Exact test at 2-sided 0.[ADDRESS_516371] missing clinical resolution status at Visit 3 (Day 5), then the last post -baseline observation will be 
carried forw ard for the determination of clinical resolution of th e study eye. 
The null hypothesis to be tested is that there is no difference in proportion of subjects w ith clinical resolution in the 
study eye between SHP640 ophthalmic Solution and placebo w ith the alternative of the non -zero difference in the 
proporti on w ith clinical resolution betw een them.
The proportion of subjects w ith clinical resolution will be compared with 2- sided Fisher’s Exact test at 5% level of 
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 17
Protocol SHP640 -303 27Sep 2016
significance.
Sensitivity analyses will be done on the primary efficacy endpoint using additional statistical method(s) including 
methods of imputation of missing data. Sensitivity analyses may be conducted in the ITT in addition to the mITT.
Key Secondary Efficacy Analyses:
All efficacy analyses will be performed on the mITT and presented by [CONTACT_22058] t groups. The key secondary efficacy 
endpoint of this study is bacterial eradication status in the study eye at Visit 3 (Day 5) between SHP640 and placebo. 
In order to maintain the study -wide Type I error at 5.0%, the primary and key secondary hypotheses will be tested 
sequentially. Each hypothesis will be tested using Fisher’s Exact test at 2-sided 5.0% level with null hypothesis of 
no difference in the proportion of subjects for the endpoint betw een the [ADDRESS_516372], the primary efficacy en dpoint w ill be tested. Only if the null hypothesis for the primary efficacy endpoint is 
rejected at 5.0% level, then the key secondary efficacy endpoint of bacterial eradication will be tested to compare 
the proportion of subjects w ith bacterial eradicatio n betw een the SHP640 and placebo treatment group. If subjects 
have missing bacterial eradication at Visit 3 (Day 5), then the last post -baseline observation will be carried forw ard 
for the determination of bacterial eradication of the study eye. 
Sensitivi ty analyses will also be done on the key secondary efficacy endpoint using similar methods as described 
above.
Secondary Efficacy Analyses:
No hypothesis testing is planned for the secondary efficacy endpoints . All secondary efficacy endpoints will be 
summ arized by [CONTACT_409485] . Continuous endpoints will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_249776] (n), mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, maximum ,and confidence 
intervals (CIs) . Binary endpoints will b e summarized by [CONTACT_249776] (n), frequencies, proportions ,and CIs .
Safety Analyses:
Safety d ata will be presented for the safety p opulation by [CONTACT_6654].
Safety data collected at baseline prior to treatment (Visit 1/ Day 1) w ill be used as the baseline value for safety 
analysis.
Adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities. The number of subjects and 
percentage with a treatment -emergent adverse event ( TEAE )as well as the number of TEAEs will be calculated 
overall, by [CONTACT_9313] , by [CONTACT_11702], and by [CONTACT_6654] . TEAEs will be further 
summarized by [CONTACT_169973]. 
AEs related to investigational product, AEs 
leading to withdrawal , serious AEs, and deaths will be similarly summarized and listed. Any AE that occurs after the 
first dose of investigational product instillation will be considered a TEAE.
Generally, TEAEs will be presented separated by [CONTACT_409486] r or a non
-ocular AE.
Slit lamp biomicroscopy, non -dilated/dilated fundus exam, BCVA, and urine pregnancy test (for females of 
childbearing potential) willbe descriptively summarized by [CONTACT_409487].

1 BACKGROUND INFORMATI ON
1.1 Indication and Current Treatment Options 
Conjunctivitis affects all populations worldwide of all ages and social strata, irrespective of 
gender. Infectious conjunctivitis (adenoviral and bacterial) represents a serious public health 
issue due to a risk of highly  infectious epi[INVESTIGATOR_7509], lost productivity , significant subject 
discomfort, and , in some cases, permanent visual compromise from long -term, immune -mediated 
sequelae ( Capriotti et al. 2010; Ford et al. 1987 ;Gordon et al. 1993 ;Nauheim et al. 1990;
Pelletier et al. 2009 ). Bacterial conjunctivitis is the second
-most common cause of infectious 
conjunctivitis with a viral etiology  being the most common cause ( Azari and Barney  2013). 
Bacterial e tiology  is more common in children, potentially  accounting for 50
-75% of all 
infectious conjunctivitis cases occurring in children ( Azari and Barney  2013 ). The condition is 
caused b y a wide variet y of bacteria, including gram-positive species such as Staphylococcus 
aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae and gram -negative species such as Haemophilus 
influenzae , Chlamydi a trachomatis , and Moraxella catarrhalis (Azari and Barney  2013; Chen 
and Starr 2008
;CDC 2010; Dias et al. 2013 ;Haas et al. 2005; Patel et al. 2007 ;Rours et al. 
2008). Bacterial conjunctivitis ty pi[INVESTIGATOR_1306] y lasts f or 7to 10days ,yet, in the absence of adequate 
treatment, it can last for weeks or months.
1.[ADDRESS_516376] Background and Clinical Information
SHP640, a novel topi[INVESTIGATOR_409458], is currentl y under development for the treatment 
of infectious conjuncti vitis (adenoviral and bacterial).
SHP640 contains 2 active ingredients: povidone- iodine (PVP -I) and dexamethasone. PVP -I is a 
multivalent broad -spectrum local antiseptic with bactericidal and fungicidal properties. The 
effect on vegetative cells of various bacteria and fungi is due to the liberation of free iodine from 
the complex. I t is effective against many viruses, protozoa, y easts, cy sts, and spores 
(Mundipharma AG 2004 ). Dexamethasone is a corticosteroid routinel y used as a topi[INVESTIGATOR_409459]. I t suppresses the inflammatory  
respons e to a variet y of causes of inflammation ([COMPANY_001] 2007). Both components are currently  
approved for use in other indications (at similar or higher concentra tions) and have been shown 
to be safe and efficacious for use on the ocular surface in humans. The combination of PVP -I and 
dexamethasone has been shown to rapi[INVESTIGATOR_409460], including viruses, 
gram -positive bacteria (including methicill in-resistant Staphylococcus aureus [MRSA ]), and 
gram -negative bacteria ( Pelletier et al. 2013 ).

risk/benefit assessment and the most accurate and current information regarding the drug 
metabolism, pharmacokinetics, efficacy ,and safety of SHP640.

2 STUDY OBJECTIVES AND PURPOSE
2.1 Rationale for the Study
The cli nical presentation of conjunctivitis is often nonspecific ,and differential diagnosis of 
different t ypes of conjunctivitis can be challenging ( Azari and Barney  2013 ;O'Brien et al. 2009). 
Diagnostic testing to differentiate the underl ying cause of infection is rarely performed in a 
clinical setting; misdiagnosis can occur in up to 50% of cases, which often results in improper 
antibiotic treatment ( Visscher et al. 2009 ). Incorrect treatment can not only  increase healthcare 
costs from unnecessary  antibiotic prescriptions and repeat office visits, but can also pose serious 
risks for people with certain viral and bacterial variants (eg, herpes simplex or MRSA). I n 
addition, there is also a risk of overuse and mi suse of antibiotics, which are ineffective in the 
treatment of viral infections ( Statham et al. 2008 ). An unmet medical need therefore exists for a 
safe and efficacious treatment that addresses both bacterial and adenoviral conjunctivitis, 2of the 
leading causes of acute infectious conjunctivitis.
By [CONTACT_409488] -I, a potent topi[INVESTIGATOR_409453] , 
with dexamethasone, a topi[INVESTIGATOR_27560], SHP640 will enable the treatment of both the infectious 
and inflammatory  components of adenoviral and bacterial conjunctivitis.
2.2 Study Objectives
2.2.1 Primary Objective
The primary  objective of this study  is to evaluate the e fficacy  of SHP640 based on clinical 
resolution (defined as absence of bulbar conjunctival injection and ocular conjunctival discharge) 
compared with placebo in the treatment of subjects with bacterial conjunctivitis in the study  eye 
at Visit 3 (Day  5). 
2.2.2 Key Secondary Objective
The key  secondary  objective is to evaluate the efficacy  of SHP640 based on bacterial eradication 
(defined as absence of all bacterial species present at or above pathological threshold at baseline 
in the study  eye) compared with place bo in the treatment of subjects with bacterial conjunctivitis 
in the study  eye at Visit 3 (Day  5).
2.2.3 Secondary Objectives
The secondary  objectives are as follows:
To evaluate the effect of treatment in the study  eye, for the following endpoints: 
Clinical re solution of bacterial conjunctivitis at Visits 2 (Day  3), 4 (Day  8)
,and 5 
(Day 12)
Bacterial eradication at Visits 2 (Day  3), 4 (Day  8),and 5 (Day  12) 
Absolute and change from baseline of the individual clinical signs (bulbar conjunctival 
injection and ocular conjunctival discharge) at Visits 2 (Day  3), 3 (Day  5), 4 (Day  8),and 
5 (Day  12)
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 22
Protocol SHP640 -303 27Sep2016

discharge) and change from baseline in the global clinical score at Visits 2 (D ay 3), 3 
(Day  5), 4 (Day  8),and 5 (Day  12) 
Modified clinical resolution, defined as a global clinical score of 0 or 1, at Visits 2 
(Day 3), 3 (Day  5), 4 (Day  8),and 5 (Day  12) 
Expanded clinical resolution, defined as a global clinical score of 0, 1, or 2 with neither 
injection nor discharge having a score of 2, at Visits 2 (Day  3), 3 (Day  5), 4 (Day  8),and 
5 (Day  12) 
Time to clinical resolution based upon assessments at Visits 2 (Day  3), 3 (Day  5), 4 
(Day 8),and 5 (Day  12) 
To evaluate the safet y andtolerability  of SHP640, compared to PVP -I and placebo in the 
treatment of subjects with bacterial conjunctivitis
2.2.4 Exploratory Objectives
The exploratory  objectives of this study  are as follows: 
To evaluate ocular discomfort due to conjunctivitis sy mptoms in subjects receiving SHP640 
compared to PVP -I and placebo at Visits 2 (Day  3), 3 (Day 5), 4 (Day  8),and 5 (Day  12)

7 STUDY PROCEDURES
7.1 Study Schedule
The detailed stud y procedures/assessments to be performed throughout the study are outlined in 
the Schedule of Assessments (see Table 1 ) and must be referred to in conjunction with the 
instructions provided in this section. Procedures or ass essments that are not completed or are 
performed out of order should be captured as protocol deviations.
Prior to performing an y study-related procedures (including those related to screening), the 
investigator or his/her designee must obtain written infor med consent from the subject (as per 
local requirements). If a subject is y ounger than the legal age of consent (per local laws), the 
subject ’s parent(s), guardian, or legall y authorized representative will provide written informed 
consent; the subject will provide verbal or written assent as appropriate. There must be 
documentation of consent/assent (as per local requirements) indicating that the subject is aware 
of the investigational nature of the stud y and the required procedures and restrictions, prior to 
performing an y stud y-related procedures. 
Where applicable, all procedures will be performed in both ey es.
7.1.1 Visit 1 (Day 1)
Screening and baseline/randomization will occur at Visit 1. Visit [ADDRESS_516420] who has given informed consent and failed to meet the inclusion 
and/or met at least [ADDRESS_516421] be recorded in the source documents 
and CRF. 
Prior to randomization, the procedures should be performed in the following order (in both eyes, 
as appropriate):
Informed consent (and assent, if applicable)
Inclusion/exclusion criteria
Medical history
Demographics
Concomitant medications
Urine pregnancy  test (for women of childbearing potential)
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 38

24 hours of Visit 1)
If any findings during screening exams do not meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria, the subject is 
not eligible to be randomized. 
Eligible sub jects must have a positive response in at least one ey e. A positive response is defined 
as meeting ALL of the following criteria in the same eye:
Report presence of signs and/or sy mptoms of bacterial conjunctivitis for ≤3 day s prior to 
Visit 1
Bulbar conju nctival injection: a grade of ≥1 on 0- 4 scale of Bulbar Conjunctival I njection 
Scale
Ocular conjunctival discharge: a grade of ≥1 (mild) on a 0 -3 scale of Ocular Conjunctival 
Discharge Scale
Study  eye will not be determined at Visit 1. All ophthalmic asse ssments will be conducted on 
both ey es. Selection of study  eye for anal yses will be according to the criteria outlined in 
Section 9.8.1.
The procedures should be performed in the following order:
Conjunctival bacterial culture collection ( 1swab per ey e) 
Non-dilated/dilated fundus examination
Randomization
Dispense and instill investigational product in both ey es by  [CONTACT_409494]. The investigational product bottle should be shaken 
well prior to use at each dosing.
All assessments, randomization, and medication instillation on Day  [ADDRESS_516422] with 
sufficient time to allow all 4 Day  1 doses (with a minimum of 2 hours between doses).
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 39
Protocol SHP640 -303 27Sep2016
7.1.2 Visit s2 (Day 3), 3 (Day 5), and 4 (Day 8)
Visit s2 (Day  3), 3 (Day  5), and 4 (Day  8) assessments will be performed as outlined in Table [ADDRESS_516423] within 12 hours of scheduled study visits. To 
ensure this, subjects should be reminded to n
ot dose the morning of Visits 2, 3, and 4. 
Medication instillation should only  be performed in- office if it is necessary  and should be done 
once all other assessments are completed. Subjects who instill medication less than 12 hours 
before stud y visits wil l be recorded as protocol deviations.
7.1.3 Visit 5 (End of Study or Early Termination)
Safet y follow-up will be conducted at Visit 5 (the end-of-study  visit). Visit 5 (Day  12) 
assessments will be performed as outlined in Table [ADDRESS_516424] collected, a compliance assessment, and drug accountability  assessed at 
their final visit.
All AEs and 
serio us AEs ( SAEs )that are not resolved at the time of Visit 5 or earl y termination 
will be followed to closure (see Section 8.1).
7.1.4
Additional Care of Subjects after the Study
No aftercare is planned for this study .
7.2 Study Evaluations and Procedures
7.2.1 Demographic and Other Baseline Characteristics
[IP_ADDRESS] Demographics
Demographic information will be collected at Visit 1. Date of birth (where permitted), a ge, sex, 
race, and e thnicit y will be recorded.
[IP_ADDRESS] Medication and Medical History
MEDICATION HISTORY
Refer to Section 5for full details on collection of prior treatment.
The investigator will categorize treatments as ocular (specified as left ey e, right ey e,or both 
eyes) or non -ocular -based on the indication for use . Prior treatment information must be recorded 
on the appropr iate CRF page . 
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page [ADDRESS_516425] all clinically  or medically  relevant information regardless of how much time 
has elapsed since the date of an y diagnosis. Medical history will be classified as ocular or 
non-ocular b y the investigator. H istory  should include but is not limited to: 
History  of ocular diseases/conditions 
History  of respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] , cardiovascular, renal, gastrointestinal, hepatic, endocrine, 
hematological, neurological, and an y other non -ocular diseases/underly ing conditions w ithin 
the past y ear prior to the screening visit (Visit 1)
[IP_ADDRESS] RPS AdenoPlus Test
The RPS AdenoPlus test will be performed at Visit 1 (unless results are available from a test 
performed within 24 hours of Visit 1) as outlined in Table 1. A negative result in both ey esis 
required for enrollment in this study .
The RPS AdenoPlus test is an in- office test that allows for the detection of adenoviral antigens 
directly  from human ey e fluid. A small tear sample is transferred onto the AdenoPlus test, which 
confirms t he presence of adenovirus and the viral form of conjunctivitis. 
Please refer to the Study  Operations Manual for a detailed description of the RPS AdenoPlus 
Test and administration.
7.2.2 Efficacy
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Resolution
Clinical resolution of bacterial conjunctivit is is defined as the absence (score=0) of bulbar 
conjunctival injection and watery  conjunctival discharge in the study  eye. Bulbar conjunctival 
injection will be assessed based on a 0 -4 scale that uses pi[INVESTIGATOR_409470] (VBR) Scale ,and watery  conjunctival discharge will be assessed based on a 0 -3 scale. 
Details of the bulbar c onjunctival injection and watery  conjunctival discharge scales are located 
in the S tudy Operations Manual.
[IP_ADDRESS] Bacterial Eradication
Bacterial eradication is defi
ned as absence of all bacterial species present at or above 
pathological threshold at baseline in the study  eye. 
Pathological threshold for individual bacterial species will be based on colony -forming unit 
(CFU)/m Lthreshold levels established by  [CONTACT_409495] d modified by  [CONTACT_409496] ( Leibowitz 1991 ). Bacterial 
species will be determined by  [CONTACT_409497]/I onization -Time of Flight Mass 
Spectrometry , using their protein patterns.
Additional details are located in the Study Operations Manual . 
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 41
Protocol SHP640 -303 27Sep2016
7.2.3 Safety
Safety  assessments will be performed in both ey es.
[IP_ADDRESS] Best Corrected Visual Acuity
The BCVA will be performed prior to slit lamp examination during the study  as outlined in
Table 1. 
The complete instructions for performing the BCVA are in the Study  Operations Manual. 
Changes in visual acuity (VA) will be assessed for clinical significance. Clinically  significant 
changes should be recorded in the source and on the 
electronic CRF ( eCRF )as an AE.
For subjects who are too young to use an ETDRS chart, an age -appropriate measurement method 
in accordance with the American Academy  of Pediatrics’ (AAP) Policy  Statement for Visual 
System Assessment in Infants, Children, and Young Adults by  [CONTACT_409498] (Donahue and Baker 
2016; American Academy of Pediatrics 2 016; located in the Study  Operations Manual) should be 
used. The policy  statement recommends that formal vision screening can begin at [ADDRESS_516426]. VA is to be measured using the same method at all visits in the same subjec t.
[IP_ADDRESS] Slit Lamp Biomicroscopy
Slit lamp biomicroscopy  (or handheld slit lamp) will be performed du ring the study as outlined 
inTable 1. 
Observations will be graded as normal or abnormal . Abnormal findings will be described, and 
clinically  significant abnormalities should be recorded in the source and on the eCRF (in medical 
history  at screening; an y changes from the screening visit may  be recorded as AEs by [CONTACT_1275]). Please note the investigator may  use his/her discretion to determine whether not 
clinically  significant (NCS) and disease progression should be considered AEs ).The following 
will be examined at each visit: 
Lids 
Conjunctiva 
Cornea
Anterior 
chamber
Iris
Lens
External examination and biomicroscopy  will be performed using a slit lamp . Magnification will 
be consistent with standard clinical practice
. The subject will be seated.
For infants and y oung children, if the above exams cannot be performed with a slit lamp or a 
hand held slit lamp, an external examination is to be conducted in accordance with the 
AAP ’s
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 42
Protocol SHP640 -303 27Sep2016
Policy  Statement for Visual Sy stem Assessment in I nfants, Children, and Young Adults b y 
Pediatricians ( Donahue and Baker 2016 ; American Academ y of Pediatrics 2 016; located in the 
Study  Operations Manual). The examination of lens in these subjects should be conducted at 
Visit s
1 and 5 (or ET visit) and graded based on the external examination and red reflex exam 
(Section [IP_ADDRESS]). All other structures listed ab ove will be examined and graded at all visits based 
on the external examination. Observations will be graded as normal or abnormal . Abnormal 
findings will be described.
[IP_ADDRESS] Non-dilated/Dilated Fundus Examination
Fundus examination must be conducted after BCVA,
slit lamp biomicroscopy ,and conjunctival 
swab for bacterial culture has been collected. 
A non- dilated fundus examination will be performed in all subjects with the exception of infants 
and uncooperative small children during the study as outlined in Table 1.
Observations will be graded as normal or a bnormal. Abnormal findings will be described.
The following will be examined:
Vitreous
Optic erve
Macula
Clinically  significant changes should be recorded in the source and on the eCRF as an AE.
If a non -dilated fundus exam is attempted and is not feasible, a dilated fundus exam should be 
conducted. The test should be conducted the same way (either dilated or non -dilated) at both 
Visit s1 and 5 (or ET).
For infants and small children in whom a fundus examina tion cannot be done, a red reflex exam 
will be conducted in accordance with the AAP Policy  Statement for Visual Sy stem Assessment 
in Infants, Children, and Young Adults by  [CONTACT_409498] ( Donahue and Baker 2016 ; 
American Academy  of Pediatrics 2016; located in the Study  Operations Manual). Observations 
will be graded as 
normal or abnormal. Abnormal findings will be described. The red reflex 
should be normal (present and sy mmetrical for both ey es) at the screening/baseline visit.
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Event Collection
At each stud y visit, subjects will be questioned in a general way to ascertain if AEs have 
occurred since the previous visit (eg, “Have y ou had any  health problems since y our last visit?”). 
Adverse events are collected from the time informed consent is signed. (Please refer to Section 8, 
Adverse and Serious Adverse Events Assessment.) An y AE that occurs after the first dose of 
investigational product instillation will be considered a treatment -emergent AE ( TEAE).
Adverse events may  also be determined b y the investigator during stud y examinations as 
mentioned in previous sections.
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 43
Protocol SHP640 -303 27Sep2016
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Laboratory Evaluations
Allclinical laboratory  assay s will be performed according to the laboratory ’s normal procedures. 
All bioanaly tical assay s for the study  will be validated following Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA )/International Conference on Harmonisation ( ICH)guidelines , based on the method ’s 
intended use. The clinical lab will only  receive sample identification numbers and collection 
dates, and the lab results will then be transferred to the central lab for data anal ysis. The lab will 
not receive an y information on subj ect treatment assignment.
One swab sample from inferior conjunctival cul- de-sac of each ey e will be collected at all study  
visits for all bacterial testing.
Bacterial eradication as well as antibiotic sensitivity  will be determined based on bacterial 
cultures using standard microbiological laboratory procedures . 
[IP_ADDRESS] Pregnancy Test 
A urine pregnancy  test is performed on all females of childbearing potential at Visit s1 and 5, or 
if pregnancy  is suspected . Urine pregnancy  test kits will be provided by  [CONTACT_409499].
[IP_ADDRESS] Health -related Quality of Life Assessments
Ocular discomfort associated with conjunctivitis sy mptoms will be assessed through the 
ocular 
discomfort s cale(ODS) . The ODS is composed of 3items: pain, itching, and foreign bod y 
sensation. All items will be evaluated using a [ADDRESS_516427] a causal relationship with this 
treatment. An AE can therefore be an y unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory  finding), s ymptom, or disease temporally  associated with the use of a medicinal 
(investigational) product, w hether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product (ICH 
Guidance E2A 1995). 
All AEs are collected from the time the informed consent is signed until the defined follow -up 
period stated in Section 7.1.[ADDRESS_516428] be followed to closure (the subject’s health has returned to his/her baseline status 
or all variables have returned to normal), regardless of whether the subject is still participating in 
the study . Closure indicates that an outcome is reached, stabilization achi eved (the investigator 
does not expect any  further improvement or worsening of the event), or the event is otherwise 
explained. When appropriate, medical tests and examinations are performed so that resolution of 
event(s) can be documented.
8.1.[ADDRESS_516429] be 
recorded as new AEs (for example, if a subject experiences mild intermittent dy spepsia prior to 
dosing of investigational product, but the dy spepsia becomes severe and more frequent after first 
dose of investigational product has been administered, a new AE of severe dy spepsia [with the 
appropriate date of onset] is recorded on the appropriate CRF).
The medical assessment of severit y is determined by [INVESTIGATOR_1477]:
Mild: A type of AE that is usua lly transient and may  require only  minimal treatment or 
therapeutic intervention. The event does not generally  interfere with usual 
activities of daily  living.
Moderate: A type of AE that is usually  alleviated with specific therapeutic intervention. The 
event interferes with usual activities of daily  living, causing discomfort but poses 
no significant or permanent risk of harm to the research subject.
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 45
Protocol SHP640 -303 27Sep2016
Severe: A type of AE that interrupts usual activities of daily  living, or significantl y affect s 
clinical status, or may  require intensive therapeutic intervention.
8.1.2 Relationship Categorization
A phy sician/investigator must make the assessment of relationship to investigational product for 
each AE. The investigator should decide whether, in his or her medical judgment, there is a 
reasonable possibility  that the event may  have been caused b y the investigational product. If 
there is no valid reason for suggesting a relationship, then the AE should be classified as “not 
related.” Otherwise, if there is any valid reason, even if undetermined or untested, for suspecting 
a possible cause -and-effect relationship between the investigational product and the occurrence 
of the AE, then the AE should be considered “related.” The causality  assessment must be 
docu mented in the source document.
The following additional guidance may  be helpful:
Term Relationship Definition
RelatedThe temporal relationship between the event and the administration of the 
investigational product is compelling and/or follows a known or suspected 
response pattern to that product, and the event cannot be explained by [CONTACT_1560]’s medical condition, other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], or accident.
Not RelatedThe event can be readily explained by [CONTACT_1605]’s 
underlying medical condi tion, concomitant therapy, or accident and no 
plausible temporal or biologic relationship exists between the investigational 
product and the event.
8.1.[ADDRESS_516430] be recorded during the course of the stud y on the CRF. Outc omes are 
as follows:
Fatal
Not recovered/Not Resolved
Recovered/Resolved
Recovered/Resolved With Sequelae 
Recovering/Resolving
Unknown
8.1.4 Symptoms of the Disease Under Study
Symptoms of the disease under study  should not be classed as AEs as long as they  are within the 
normal day -to-day fluctuation or expected progression of the disease and are part of the efficacy  
data to be collected in the study; however, significant worsening of the s ymptoms should be 
recorded as an AE.
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page [ADDRESS_516431] to the start of study  treatment, 
further investigations should be performed until the values return to within the reference range or 
until a plausible explanation (eg, concomitant d isease) is found for the abnormal values.
The investigator should decide, based on the above criteria and the clinical condition of a 
subject, whether a change in a clinical laboratory  or vital sign parameter is clinically  significant 
and therefore represe nts an AE.
8.1.[ADDRESS_516432] be reported within 24 hours to the Shire Global Pharmacovigilance and Risk 
Management Department using the Shire Investigational and Marketed Products Pregnancy  
Report Form. A cop y of the Shire Investigational and Marketed Products Pregnancy R eport 
Form (and an y applicable follow -
up reports) must also be sent to the CRO/Shire medical monitor 
using the details specified in the emergency  contact [CONTACT_1739]. The 
pregnant female stud y participant must be withdrawn from the study .
Every  effort should be made to gather information regarding the pregnancy  outcome and 
condition of the infant. It is the responsibility  of the investigator to obtain this information within 
30 calendar day s after the initial notification and approxi mately  30 calendar day s postpartum. 
Pregnancy  complications such as spontaneous abortion/miscarriage or congenital abnormality  
are considered SAEs and must be reported using the Shire Clinical Study  Serious Adverse Event 
and Non -serious AEs Required by  [CONTACT_10191]. Note: An elective abortion is not 
considered an SAE.
In addition to the above, if the investigator determines that the pregnancy  meets serious criteria, 
it must be reported as an SAE using the Shire Clinical Study  Serious Adverse Event and
Non-serious AEs Required by  [CONTACT_49136]. The test date of the first positive serum/urine -hCG 
test or ultrasound result will determine the pregnancy  onset date.
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 47
Protocol SHP640 -303 27Sep2016
8.1.7 Abuse, Misuse, Overdose, and Medication Error
Abuse, misuse, overdose, or medication error (as defined below) must be reported to the sponsor 
according to the SAE reporting procedure whether or not they  result in an AE/SAE as described 
in Section 8.2. Note: The 24- hour reporting requirement for SAEs does not apply  to reports of 
abuse, misuse, overdose, or medication errors unless these result in an SAE. 
The categories below are not mutually  exclusive; the event can meet more than 1 category :
Abuse –Persistent or sporadic intentional intake of investigational product when used for a 
non-medical purpose (eg, to alter one’s state of consciousness or get high) in a manner that 
may be detrimental to the individual and/or society
Misuse –Intentional use of investigational product other than as directed or indicated at any  
dose (Note: This includes a situation where the investigational product is not used as directed 
at the dose prescribed b y the protocol .)
Overdose –Intentional or unintentional intake of a dose of an investigational product 
exceeding a pre -specified total daily  dose of [ADDRESS_516433]. 
Medication Error –An error made in prescribing, dispensing, administration, and/or use of 
an investigational product. For studies, medication errors ar e reportable to the sponsor only  
as defined below.
Cases of subjects missing doses of the investigational product are not considered reportable as 
medication errors.
Medication errors should be collected/reported for all products under investigation.
The administration and/or use of the unassigned treatment is/are alway s reported as a medication 
error.
The administration and/or use of an expi[INVESTIGATOR_409471] a 
medication error.
In cases of overdose ,
the investigator should determine if the medical monitor must be contact[CONTACT_409500].
All investigational product provided to pediatric subjects should be administered or supervised 
by [CONTACT_7071](s)/guardian/legall y authorized representative/caregiver.
8.2 Serious Adverse Even t Procedures
8.2.1 Reference Safety Information
The reference for safet y information for this study  is the investigator’s brochure, which the 
sponsor has provided under separate cover to all investigators.
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page [ADDRESS_516434] be reported by  [CONTACT_38910]/Shire medical monitor 
within [ADDRESS_516435] awareness of the event. Note: The 24 -hour reporting requirement for 
SAEs does not apply  to reports of abuse, misuse, overdose, or medication errors (see 
Section 8.1.7) unless they result in an SAE. 
The investigator must complete, sign, and date the Shire Clinical Study  Serious Adverse Event 
and Non -serious AEs Required by  [CONTACT_409501] (Note: Source documents are not 
to be sent unless requested) and fax or e -
mail the form to the Shire Global Pharmacovigilance 
and Risk Management Dep artment. A cop y of the Shire Clinical Study  Serious Adverse Event 
and Non -serious AEs Required by [CONTACT_10191] (and any  applicable follow -up reports) 
must also be sent to the CRO/Shire medical monitor using the details specified in the emergency  
conta ct information section of the protocol.
8.2.[ADDRESS_516436] medical occurrence (whether considered to be related to investigational 
product or not) that at any dose:
Results in death
Is life -threatening. Note: The term “ life-threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an 
event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an 
event which h ypothetically might have caused death if it was more severe.
Requires in- subject hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]. Note: 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], which are the result of elective or previousl y scheduled surgery for 
pre-existing conditions, which have not worsened after initiation of treatment, should not be 
classified as SAEs. For example, an admission for a previousl y scheduled ventral hernia 
repair would not be classified as an SAE; however, complication(s) resulting from a 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10153] y scheduled surgery  that meet(s) serious criteria 
must be reported as SAE(s).
Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity
Is a congenital abnormality /birth defect
Is an important medical event. Note: I mportant medical events that may  not result in death, 
be life -threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10154], based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they  may  jeopardize the subject and may  require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent [ADDRESS_516437] ion Time Frame
All SAEs (regardless of relationship to study ) are collected from the time the subject provides 
written informed consent (and assent, if applicable) until the defined follow -up period stated in 
Section 7.1.[ADDRESS_516438] be reported to the Shire Global Pharmacovigilance and Risk Management 
Department and the CRO/Shire medical monitor within [ADDRESS_516439] awareness of the 
event. 
In addition, any
 SAE(s) considered “related” to the investigational product and discovered by  [CONTACT_10194] y interval after the study has completed must be reported to the Shire Global 
Pharmacovigilance and Risk Management Department within [ADDRESS_516440]’s death (ie, the SAE was noted as the primary  cause of death) 
must have fatal checked as an outcome with the date of death recorded a s the resolution date. For 
all other events ongoing at the time of death that did not contribute to the subject’s death, the 
outcome should be considered not resolved, without a resolution date recorded.
For an y SAE that results in the subject’s death or a ny ongoing events at the time of death, unless 
another investigational product action was previously  taken (eg, drug interrupted, reduced, 
withdrawn), the action taken with the investigational product should be recorded as “dose not 
changed” or “not applic able” (if the subject never received investigational product). The 
investigational product action of “withdrawn” should not be selected solel y as a result of the 
subject’s death. 
8.2.[ADDRESS_516441], Ethics Committee, and Site 
Reporting
The sponsor and/or the clinical CRO is responsible for notify ing the relevant regulatory  
authorities and Institutional Review Boards ( IRBs)/ethics committees ( ECs) of related, 
unexpected SAEs.
In addition, the sponsor and/or the clinical CRO is res ponsible for notify ing active sites of all 
related, unexpected SAEs occurring during all interventional studies across the SHP640 
program.

9 DATA MANAGEMENT AND STATISTICAL METHODS
9.1 Data Collection
The investigator ’sauthorized site personnel must enter the information required by  [CONTACT_64760]. A study  monitor will visit each site in ac cordance with the monitoring plan and 
review the CRF data against the source data for completeness and accuracy. Discrepancies 
between source data and data entered on the CRF will be addressed b y qualified site personnel. 
When a data discrepancy warrants c orrection, the correction will be made by  [CONTACT_59752]. Data collection procedures will be discussed with the site at the site initiation visit 
and/or at the investigator’s meeting. Once a subject is randomized, it is expected that site 
person nel will complete the CRF entry  within approximately  [ADDRESS_516442]’s 
visit.
9.2 Clinical Data Management
Data are to be entered into a clinical database as specified in the CRF Completion Guidelines. 
Quality  control and data validation procedu res are applied to ensure the validity  and accuracy  of 
the clinical database.
Data are to be reviewed and checked for omissions, errors, and values requiring further 
clarification using computerized and manual procedures. Data queries requiring clarificati on are 
to be communicated to the site for resolution. Only authorized personnel will make corrections to 
the clinical database, and all corrections are documented in an auditable manner.
9.3 Data Handling Considerations
Data that may  potentiall y unmask the tre atment assignment (ie, investigational product serum 
concentrations, treatment allocation, and investigational product preparation/accountability  data) 
will be handled with special care during the data cleaning and review process. These data will be 
handle d in such a way  that, prior to unmasking, any  data that may  unmask study  team personnel 
will be presented as masked information or otherwise will not be made available. If applicable, 
unmasked data may  be made available to quality  assurance representatives for the purposes of 
conducting independent drug audits. 
9.4 Statistical Analysis Process
The study  will be anal yzed by  [CONTACT_10196]. 
The statistical anal ysis plan (SAP) will provide the statistical methods and definitions for the 
analysis of the efficacy  and safet y data as well as describe the approaches to be taken for 
summarizing other study  information such as subject disposition, demographics and baseline 
characteristics, investigational product exposure, and prior and concomitant medications . The 
SAP will also include a description of how missing, unused , and spurious data will be addressed.
In addition to a final SAP for the final anal ysis, a separate SAP for the interim analy sis will be 
finalized prior to unmasking and performing the interi m anal ysis.The SAP for the final anal ysis 
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 52
Protocol SHP640 -303 27Sep2016
will be finalized prior to unmasking of the stud y to preserve the integrit y of the statistical 
analysis and study  conclusions. 
All final statistical analy ses will be performed after the database is locked and unm asked.
All statistical analy ses will be performed using SAS(SAS I nstitute, Cary , NC [ZIP_CODE]) Version 
9.2 or higher. 
9.5 Planned Interim Analysis, Adaptive Design, and Data Monitoring Committee
An unmasked interim analy sis (IA) will be performed after ~50% subjects exit the trial in the 
modified intent- to-treat ( mITT)population (ie ,n=252 in mI TT), with data to be anal yzed entered 
into the database, queried, and discrepancies resolved . The purpose of the IA will be to assess the 
adequacy  of the initial sample size estimation by  [CONTACT_409502]640 versus placebo on clinical resolution in the treatment of subjects with 
bacterial conjunctivitis in the study  eye at Visit 3 (Day  5). There is no intention to stop early  for 
efficacy  or futility  based on the results from the IA. 
The IA will be performed by  [CONTACT_409503]/or unmasked 
programmers based on a prespecified interim SAP. The interim SAP will explicitly  describe how 
the condition al power is to be calculated and the precise rules for altering the sample size 
depending on the potential results. The interim SAP will be finalized prior to IA. The interim 
statistical report including the results will be distributed only  to a limited gr oup of people who 
are not involved in the conduct of the trial. All sponsor, CRO, and site staff involved in the 
conduct of the trial must remain masked throughout the trial. Recommendation from the IA to 
increase the sample size may  require an amendment t o the study  protocol. No adjustment of ty pe
I error rate is needed because the sole purpose of the planned IAis to adjust the sample size by  
[CONTACT_409504] ,and the sample size will be changed only  under certain 
conditions ( Mehta and Pocock 2011 ).
9.6 Sample Size Calculation and Power Considerations
The sample size was estimated for the primary  comparison of SHP640 versus placebo on clinical 
resolution in the treatment of subjects with bacterial conjunctivitis in the study  eye at Visit 3 
(Day  5) using nQuery  Advisor 7.0. Subjects will be randomized 3:1:3 to receive either SHP640, 
PVP-I, or placebo within each age stratum. 
A sample size of 504 subjects (216 subjects in each of the SHP640 and placebo groups, 72 in 
PVP-I group) will ensure ~90% power to compare the SHP640 and placebo treatment groups 
assuming 61% and 45% subjects with clinical resolution ,respectivel y,using Fisher’s Exact test 
at 2-sided 5% level of significance. All efficacy  analy ses will be based on the mITT with post -
baseline last observation carried forward for the subjects with missing clinical resolution status 
as Visit 3 (Day  5).
An exploratory  PVP -I arm (ie , 72 subjects in mI TT and approximately  103 randomized subjects) 
will be included in the trial to provide parameter estimates on PVP -I treatment effect to inform 
future studies. No formal hy pothesis testing will be conducted on the PVP -I arm. 
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 53
Protocol SHP640 -303 27Sep2016
To ensure 504 s ubjects in the mI TT population, approximately  721 subjects will be randomized 
in this study  (approximately  309 subjects in each of SHP640 and placebo groups ;approximately  
103 subjects in PVP -I group).
9.[ADDRESS_516443] .
The intent -to-
treat (ITT) p opulation will include all randomized subjects. 
ThemITT population consists of a subset of the ITT population who receive at least 1dose of 
investigational pr oduct and have a positive bacterial culture (presence of 1 or more bacterial 
species at or above pathological threshold) at baseline in the study  eye
.
9.8 Efficacy Analyses
The anal yses on primary , key  secondary , secondary ,and exploratory  efficacy  endpoints w ill be 
performed on the mITT population and will be presented by  [CONTACT_1570]. 
Additional sensitivity  analy ses may  be conducted in the I TT population.
For both efficacy  and safety  anal yses, baseline is defined as the assessments taken prior to 
treatment at Visit 1 (Day  1).
9.8.[ADDRESS_516444] 1 for both ocular conjunctival discharge and bulbar conjunctival redness at 
baseline (baseline is de fined as the assessments taken prior to treatment at Visit 1 [Day  1]):
For subjects with both eyes eligible and both with a positive bacterial culture (presence of 1 
or more bacterial species at or above pathological threshold) at baseline or both ey es eli gible 
and both with a non -positive bacterial culture (absence of any  bacterial species at or above 
pathological threshold) at baseline, the stud y eye will be the ey e with the highest global 
clinical score (sum of bulbar conjunctival injection and ocular co njunctival discharge) at 
baseline. If both ey
es have the same global clinical score at baseline, then the study  eye will 
be the right ey e. 
For subjects with both eyes eligible with a positive bacterial culture in 1eye at baseline, the 
baseline bacterial culture positive ey e will be the study  eye. 
For subjects with onl y 1eligible ey e, the eligible ey e will be the study  eye irrespective of its 
baseline bacterial culture result. 
The study  eye designation is summarized in the table below:
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 54
Protocol SHP640 -303 27Sep2016
Eligible Eye(s) Bacterial Culture Results Study Eye
Both eyes Both eyes positiveHighest global clinical score at Visit 1 (Day 1)
(or right eye if scores are the same)
Both eyes Both eyes negativeHighest global clinical score at Visit 1 (Day 1)
(or right eye if scores are the same)
Both eyes One eye positive The bacterial culture positive eye at Visit 1 (Day 1) 
One eye Positive or negative for either eye The eligible eye

of bulbar conjunctival injection and ocular conjunctival discharge) in the study  eye at Visit 3 
(Day  5) between SHP640 and placebo.
All efficacy  analy ses will be performed on the mITT population and presented by  [CONTACT_98540]. There is a single primary  comparison for the single primary  endpoint. Therefore, no 
adjustment of multiplicity  is needed for the hy pothesis testing for the primary  objective. 
The primary  efficacy  endpoint of clinical resolution in the st udy eye at Visit 3 (Day  5) will be 
compared between the SHP640 and placebo group. The comparison will be based on the 
proportion of subjects with clinical resolution in the study  eye at Visit 3 (Day  5) using Fisher’s 
Exact test at
2-sided 0.[ADDRESS_516446] missing clinical resolution status at Visit 3 (Day  5), then the last post -baseline 
observation will be carried forward for the determination of clinical resolution of the study  eye. 
The null hy pothesis to be tested is that there is no difference in proportion of subjects with 
clinical resolution in the study  eye between SHP640 
ophthalmic solution and placebo with the 
alternative of the non -zero difference in the proportion with clinical resolution between them .
The proportion of subjects with clinical resolution will be compared with 2- sided Fisher’s Exact 
test at 5% level of significance.
Sensitivity  analy ses will be done on the primary  efficacy  endpoint using additional statistical 
method(s) including other methods of imputation of missing data. Sensitivity  analy ses may  be 
conducted in the ITT population in addition to the mI TT. In addition, descriptive statistics will 
be generated for the primary  efficacy  endpoint by  [CONTACT_409505] (ie, 1 month to 18 y ears) and within each pediatric age stratum (1 month to <6 y ears 
and 6 to <18 years) in mITT if pediatric subjects enrolled in the study  are relatively  well 
distributed across both pediatric subgroups in mITT. A detailed plan for primary  anal ysis 
including additional sensitivity  anal yses will be described in the SAP.
9.8.3 Key Secondary Efficacy Endpoints
The key  secondary  efficacy  endpoint is bacterial eradication status (defined as absence of all 
bacterial species present at or above pathological thresho ld at baseline) in the study  eye at Visit 3 
(Day  5) between SHP640 and placebo.
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 55
Protocol SHP640 -303 27Sep2016
All efficacy  analy ses will be performed on the mITT population and presented by  [CONTACT_98540]. In order to maintain the study- wide Ty pe I error at 5.0%, the primary  and key  secondary  
hypotheses will be tested sequentially . Each hy pothesis will be tested using Fisher ’s Exact test at 
2-sided 5.0% level with null hy pothesis of no difference in the proportion of subjects for the 
endpoint between the [ADDRESS_516447], th e primary
 efficacy  endpoint will be tested. Only  if the null hy pothesis for the primary  
efficacy  endpoint is rejected at 5.0% level, then the key  secondary  efficacy  endpoint of bacterial 
eradication will be tested to compare the proportion of subjects with bacterial eradication 
between the SHP640 and placebo treatment group. If subjects have missing bacterial eradication 
status at Visit 3 (Day  5), then the last post -baseline observation will be carried forward for the 
determination of bacterial eradication of the study  eye. 
Sensitivity  analy ses will also be done on key  secondary  efficacy  endpoints using similar methods 
as described above. In addition, descriptive statistics will be generated for the key secondary 
efficacy  endpoint by  [CONTACT_409506] (ie ,1 month to 18 y ears) 
and within each pediatric age stratum ( 1 month to <6 y ears and 6 to <18 y ears) inthemITT 
population if pediatric subjects enrolled in the study  are relativel y well distributed across both 
pediatric sub groups in mITT . Details on the anal yses will be described in the SAP.

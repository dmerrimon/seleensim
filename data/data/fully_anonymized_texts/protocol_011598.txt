4.1 Background  
Staphyl ococc us aureus  (S. aureus ) and sp eciall y the more antibioti c resistant strain, Methicillin -
Resistant S. aur eus (MRSA ), is a common cau sative organism of noso comial infections in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] s across the world8. It was estimated tha t 1% of all hospi[INVESTIGATOR_145959] (US) su ffered  from S. aureus  infections, equating to nearly 400,[ADDRESS_167267] of $14. [ADDRESS_167268] noso comial infections caused by S. aureus  (including 
MRSA) , Surgical Site Infections (SSIs) are a major  infectious entity and are a caus e of 
significant morbidity  and mortality22,23. The prevalence of MRSA noso comi al infe ctions in the 
US ranges from 42.6% to 5 2.0% depending of the site of  the nosocomial infe ction23. The most 
recent data from the National He althc are Safety Network (NHSN) in  the U S showed that despit e 
recent efforts, 42 .6% of all reported S. aureu s surgical site infections were due to MRSA23. At 
least 80% of such infections are caused by [CONTACT_145984]’ own bacteria9-11. S. aureus  can colonize 
severa l body sites - nose, axillae , groi n and throat - altho ugh the anterior nar es are the preferred 
ecologi c niche and  are identified as the most frequent si te of carriage11-13, with 25 to 35%14 of the 
popu lation being colonize d at any given time. S. aureu s carriers are at a higher risk o f 
staphylococcal infection s after invasive med ical or surgical procedures than non-carriers, having 
been estimated to be 2 t o 10 times more likely to dev elop surgical -site/i ntravenous catheter 
infections15-18. Specifically,  S. aureus  nasal carriage has bee n iden tified as a risk fac tor for the 
developm ent of infections in orthopa edic, thora cic and general surgery as summarized i n a 
review by [CONTACT_145985]  (2005)11. 
Standard i nfection control meas ures, including hand -washing by [CONTACT_145986] 70% alcohol, ward cl eaning, disinfecting  equipment, correct handling  of clinica l waste, etc are 
important for limiting  MRSA cross -infection. Howeve r, body decolonizati on procedures 
(typi[INVESTIGATOR_145960]) have been  adopt ed or recommended 
for at-risk patients i n many settings25. 
In 2010, Bode  et al reported the res ults of a randomized, d ouble -blind, placebo -controll ed study 
investigati ng nasal and body dec olonization and concluded tha t hos pi[INVESTIGATOR_307]-acquired infections wi th 
S. aureus could be prev ented by [CONTACT_145987] (na sal and bod y) 
immediately a fter admission of surgi cal patients20. In a commenta ry on this study, Be rtrand et al 
also con cluded that pre -emptive S. aureus decolonization should be use d in s urgery with a high 
risk of S. aureus  infection such as open -heart su rgery and o rthopaedic or ne urosurgical implant 
procedures9. In their review of published data on de colonization therapy from [ADDRESS_167269] reported a study 
in 7,019 orthopaedic  surgical patients, c oncluding that a program of i denti fication and 
eradication of both M RSA and methicillin -sensitive S. aureus  (MSSA) carriage with intrana sal 
mupi[INVESTIGATOR_145961] t o significant reductions in p ost-operative rates of 
surgical site infe ction5. 
In February 2013, a c onsen sus involving the Surgical I nfecti on Society (SIS), In fectious Disease 
Society of America (IDSA) and T he Society for Healthcare E pi[INVESTIGATOR_145962]  (SHEA), 
published guidelines  which recommend the  use of nasal decolon ization of all S. aureus  in 
cardio vascular and orthopaedic sur gery26. They also discusse d the risks in other  clean surgeries 
where there  was not th e level of proof  to make a formal recom mendation yet. As the only 
Destiny Pharma plc  Clinical Protocol  v2.[ADDRESS_167270] approvals do n ot explicitly exempli fy the use 
of prophylactic in trana sal (IN) antibiotics by [CONTACT_145988] p atients . In the US , Mupi[INVESTIGATOR_19190] 
(Bactroban®) is indicated for MRSA dec olonization  during institut ional outbreaks; in Eur ope the 
indication is worded:  ‘the elimination of  nasal carriage of st aphylococci, including MRSA’ . In 
fact, S. aureus  nasal decolon isatio n is not universally  accepted practice a nd if practiced it is not 
done in a sta ndard manner, bu t with a variety of pro ducts and dosing regimens for  each product  
as non e of these are approv ed for the intended indicatio n. 
Exeporfinium chloride (XF -73) is a d icationic porphyrin derivative having po tent bactericidal 
properties  with a nov el mode of actio n. XF-73 is being devel oped as a viscous dermal gel for the 
decolonizati on of S. aureus  in the anterior nares (nasal cavit y) to prevent post -operative 
staphyloco ccal infections.  
XF-[ADDRESS_167271] a panel of 101  Gram-posit ive and Gram -negative organisms

isolates ( 56 ae robic and 9 anaerobic) and 3 6 Gram -negative isolates ( 31 aerobic and

(MICs ) of 0.25 to 4 mg/L . The antibacterial activi ty against Gram -nega tive species was lower, 
with MIC s of 1 mg/L to >  64 mg/L. The study indicated that XF -[ADDRESS_167273] S. aureus, including methic illin-resistant strains (incl uding  [LOCATION_003]300) 2 (Study R14 ). 
Expo sure o f bacteria to XF -73 result ed in an obser ved loss of membrane potenti al within 
1 minute, followe d by [CONTACT_145989], ATP  and potassium; 
>99.99% of S. aureus  are killed within 5 minutes1. The  mode  of action is thus focused o n the 
bacterial cell membr ane. Cell death is n ot accompanied by [CONTACT_145990] t he cells, a s observed by 
[CONTACT_46106] (Stud y R39) or resulting in efflux  of large molecular weight components 
(DNA, RNA, proteins) 1. 
A multis tep study, in which MRSA was pass aged 5 5 times, showed that  XF-73 had a very lo w 
potential for inducing res istance ove r the 55 passage s. The MIC values showe d no more than a 
4-fold incre ase over the startin g MIC and the accepte d threshold for resistance (≥  8-fold increase 
in MIC) was not reache d3.  
The speed of on set of anti -staphylococcal activity of XF -[ADDRESS_167274] been 7 completed clinical studies on X F-73 (5 intran asal and 2 dermal ) in 263 
patient s, of which 2 41 received X F-73. In the intranasal (i.n.) studies c arried wi thout 
photodymanic therapy, the most common (≥10%) adverse events (AEs) reported with XF -73 gel 
application are headache ( 11.4%), nasal discomfort (9.0%), and rhinorrhoea  (7.8%). Most  of the

CONFIDENTIAL   21 treatment -emergent AEs (TEAEs) associate d with nasal gel applicat ion from previous studies 
were considered mild to  moderate in intensity . Further details can be found in the  current version 
of Investigator's Brochure  (IB), which cont ains comprehensive in format ion on the investigational 
product.  
This is a proof -of-concep t study which will assess the efficacy and safety  of XF -[ADDRESS_167275] -operative  staph ylococcal infections.  
4.2 Rationale  
XF-73 provided as a 2  mg/g n asal gel with  is being 
developed for the prevention of post -operative  staphylococcal infections. Both microbiological 
and clinical data  support the move of XF-[ADDRESS_167276] -operative  staphylococcal 
infection,  the p opulation for which XF -73 is intended .  
XF-73 possesses anti -bacterial activity in vitro in the 0.5 to 1 mg/L  concentration range,  against 
S. aureus  colonies, including MRSA , as well as for other potentially pathogenic Staphyloco cci 
spp. This antibac terial  activity is rapid and suggests that a s hort duration of trea tment e.g., [ADDRESS_167277] 
already assess ed the safety of XF -73 2 mg/g nasal gel and preliminary efficacy in  reducing the 
burden of S. aureus  in the no se: study XF-73B03 study  with [ADDRESS_167278]  used different regim ens 
concentrations of XF -73 (0.5 mg/g and 2 mg /g) in different regi mens (from 1 IN application 
every 12  hours for 2 days to 1 IN application every 8 hours for 1 day and then every 12  hours for 
another 4 days) and have analysed  efficacy  (burden of nasal S. aureus ) in various ways 
(percentage of patient s deco lonized, evolut ion of quantitative S. aureus  scores and area und er the 
curve of quantitative S. aureus  scores). Although limited in volunteers’  numbers, both studies 
have shown consis tent better responses  for the XF -73 2mg/g nasal gel compared to pla cebo. 
These studies h ave also allowed to assess the dynamics of nasal burden of S. aureus  when 
exposed to XF -[ADDRESS_167279] dep icted a favourable safety and tolerability pro file for XF -73. XF -73 has also 
been assessed for safety up to 5.0  mg/g  aqueous solution applied to the shoulder in healthy 
volunteers. These data suggest that XF -[ADDRESS_167280]-operative  staphylococcal infectio ns. Please refer to the current IB for further  information.  
4.3 Risk -Benefit Assessment  
The safety of nasal application of XF -73 in concentrations up to 2 mg/g , cumulative doses up to 
13.[ADDRESS_167281] not revealed erythema o r 
increased secretions , so these events seem to be more related with the physical presen ce and 
sensation of the gel in the nares rather than a physiological interaction with the nasal mucosa; 
though a dose r esponse cannot be fully ruled out.  
Only one susp ected unexpe cted serio us adverse reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R), hyposmia, has been reported ; 
and has also been the only related serious adverse event so far. This was in study DMID11 -[ADDRESS_167282] been determined in all  studies up to date showing no evidence of 
systemic absorption (assay detection limit 0.2 ng/mL), therefore no systemic  toxicity from XF -[ADDRESS_167283] been no 
AEs leading to t reatment or study discontinuation.  
XF-73 provided as a nasal gel has been shown to be well tolerated in different heal thy volunteer 
studie s; nevertheless in this Phase 2 study, wi th patient s who will undergo surgery, besides the 
usual safety exams (physic al, biochemistry and haematological laboratory tests) a nasal 
examination by [CONTACT_145991] (ENT) specialist wi ll be performed pre and post-dosing to 
further as sess the risks from the contact [CONTACT_145992] -[ADDRESS_167284] to address the possible risk of hyposmia as it was seen in study DMID11 -007. 
An independent data moni toring committee ( IDMC) of experts will be set up  which will 
regularly review the safety information from the study as well as the incid ence of post -operative  
staphylococcal infections. Should these reach an unexpectedly high level, the IDMC can 
recommend  stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_10098] . The IDMC charter containing am ongst others  membershi p, 
meetings frequency, structure and procedures produced before randomization of the first patient  
will be updated implem enting the ch anges introduced  in this version  2.[ADDRESS_167285] -operative  staphylococca l infections. This benefi t will be difficult to 
apprec iate in this  study as the incidence of these infections is low and the number patients to 
enrol very limited.  
In summary, even though a benefit cannot be guaranteed or measured, only expected ; the risks  
are limited . Additionall y, surveillance measures  to reassess bene fit-risk d uring the execution of 
the study such as the nasal examination sm ell test  and an IDMC  are in place; so that appropriate 
action can be taken should an unexpected signal a rise. The r isk-benefit assessment is  therefore 
thought to be favo urable in th is study.

6.2.1 Rationale for the Dosage of XF -73 
The dosing regimen to be ass essed in this study, four 0. 3 mL applicat ions in each naris of 
a 2 mg/g XF -73  nasal  gel 24 hours  before surgery and a 5th application right 
after surgery (a cumulative dose of 6 mg of XF -73), is supported by [CONTACT_145994] -73 Phase 1 studies. Microbi ological data  showed that XF -73 has a 
rapid antibacter ial acti vity and sugg ests that a short duration of treatment may be 
possible, facilitating compliance with this treatment.  
In study XF -73B03, 6 3 healthy volunteers (safety p opulation ) who were nasal pe rsistent 
carriers of  S. aureus  were randomly assigned to recei ve X F-73 nasa l gel (0.5 mg/gr) or 
XF-73 nasal gel (2.0 mg/gr), both with , or placebo in each naris every 12  hours 
for 2 days; 27,  [ADDRESS_167300] ively. Burden of  S. aureus  in the 
naris was measured as semiquantitative  S. aureu s scores duri ng the 2-day treatment 
period and up to discharge ( Day 4) and follow -up (up to Day 6).  
The efficacy data for the treatment  period showed consistent bett er respon ses for the 
2 XF-73 groups than for placebo in different efficacy measure s: eradi cation rates of 
S. aureus  from participants’ noses; semiquantitative  S. aureus  scores; time to first 
clearance and mean differences in A UC. In many instances these di fferences  were 
statistically  significant in favour of XF -73. In the efficacy data at disch arge (Day 4),  on 
the other hand, only the AUC analysis showed statistically significant differences in 
favour of XF -73 groups for the di scharge . No differences betwee n study g roups were 
detected  during the f ollow -up period (Days 7 and 14). XF -73 wa s well t olerated at a ll 
dose levels used in this study.  
Results for eradication of  S. aureus  during the treatment period (i.e. , after [ADDRESS_167301] 48 -hour period ), 
are descr ibed in the Table 6.1 below. In summary, for the XF -73 2.0 mg/g group there 
was a 41.7% (10 out of 24,  P = 0.0087) clearance of  S. aureus  carriage at 24 hours a fter 
2 doses (total dose 2.4 mg of XF -73) and a 37.5% (9 out o f 24, P = 0.0965) clearance of  
S. aureus  carriage at 48 hours after 4 doses (total dose 4.8 mg of XF -73) over placebo. 
For the XF -73 0.5  mg/g  group the was a 33 .3% (4 out  of 12, P = 0.0804 ) 
clearance o f S. aureus  carriage at 24 hours after 2 doses (t otal dose 0.6  mg of XF -73) and 
a 50% (6  out of 16, P = 0.0455) clearance of  S. aureus  carriage at 48 hours after 4 doses 
(total dose 1.2  mg of XF -73) over placebo.

In addition, the analysis of semi -quantitativ e S. aureus  scores during the treatment period 
also showed a more marked decrease from baseline in the 2 XF-73 treatment groups than 
in the placebo group. This same d ifference was shown in the a nalysis of me an differences 
in AUC during the treatmen t period  and it was s tatistically significant with better 
responses for the XF-73 groups. Moreover, statistical AUC analysis and the change fro m 
baseline in the reduction in  S. aureus  semi-quantitative  scores there was an apparent dose 
response relationsh ip with t he higher 2.0  mg/g XF -73 dosage performing better than the 
0.5 mg/g dosage.  
In conclusion , these data from the study suggest that the h ighest concentration of XF -73 
(i.e., 2.0  mg/g) should be u sed to get a m aximum response and that an efficient do se 
should  be provided right before the point of highest risk for development of post -
operative  infections (i.e. , right before surgery).  
In the h ealthy volunteer study DMID11 -007, 52 hea lthy volunteers ( safety populat ion) 
who were nasal persistent carriers of S. aureus received XF-73 nasal gel (0.5 mg/gr)  
 or XF -73 nasal gel (2.0 mg/gr)  or XF -73 nasal gel (0.5 mg/gr)  or 
placebo in each naris every 8  hours on Day 1 and every 12 hours Days 2 to 5; thi s 
provided cumulative doses of XF -73 of 3.3 mg, 1 3.2 mg and 3. 3 mg respectively. 
Thirteen volunteers were randomly assigned to each group. Burden of  S. aureus  in the 
naris was measured  as semiquantitative  S. aureus  scores dur ing the 5-day tre atment 
period and up to discharge (up to Day 6).  
The efficacy data for the treatment period supported the conclusions from study 
XF73 -B03. Early in treatment there were important differences in the  number of

CONFIDENT IAL  30 • There is no approved drug for S. aureus  nasal decolonization  to prevent post -
operative  staphylococcal  infections, the indication  under study  
• Studies of nasal decolonisation  of S. aureus show a s ignificant variability in the 
microbiological measurements and an important placebo effect (up to 50%-60%) 
which supports the need for a placeb o to appr opriately a ssess the effect of XF -73.  
• S. aureus  nasal decolonisation prior to sur gery is n ot universall y accepted  practice 
and when practiced it is not done in a standard way, but with considerable 
variation in the products a nd dosing regimens us ed of eac h product ; as these 
products  are not appro ved for the intended indication.   
• The st udy’s pri mary  endpoint  is based on microbiological data, not clinical. No 
impact is expected on post -operative staphylococcal infections from th e use of 
placebo as t heir inci dence is lo w and the sample size not enoug h to detect it.

stored until use.  Each bottle/kit will includ e a pack number w hich wi ll be allocated to a 
single patient using  the IRT system. Study drug will be label led in acc ordance with 
applicable r egulatory requirement s. 
The study drugs  must be stored  at room temperat ure, below 25˚C and protected from 
light (by [CONTACT_145998]). The study drug must not be refrigerated or 
frozen.  Each bottle and kit containing study drug is labelled w ith an expir y date. The

Swabs will be transferred to the microbiological laboratory and standard microbiology 
culture techniques will be used to quantify the number of bacteria  in CFU/ mL at each 
timepoint.  
In order  to appropriat ely assess the incidenc e of post-operative staphylococcal infections 
investigators will take all reasonable efforts to obtain microbiological  documentation and 
a bacterial isolate when the suspi[INVESTIGATOR_1884] p ost-operative infection  is raised. This  includes 
but is not limited to the c ollection and culture of exudates, blood, implant or other 
specimens according to the suspected site of infection. Iso lates of Staphylococcus spp. 
obtained from these cultures will  be kept  for further an alysis and chara cterization  (e.g., 
genotypic and phen otypic cha racterization) . 
These samples as well as those bacterial isolates obtained from the nasal swabs during the 
study will kept for up to [ADDRESS_167319] access to the samples and will 
perform microbiologica l work on behalf of the sponsor. Additionally, bacterial isola tes 
may be shared with academic researc hers.  
As these  are bacterial samples,  no human genetic testing will be performed.  
9.1.3 Microbiological Specimen Collection and Culture for  S. aureus  
The Laborat ory Manual  of Microbial Procedures will describe the details of collec tion 
and proces sing met hods for  microbiological samples, including t ype of nas al swab and

Any staphylo coccal post -operative  infections arising betwe en study  treatme nt and up to 
30 or 90  days (if foreig n implant)  included but not limited to SSI, bloodstream infections, 
catheter -related infections, and implant infectio ns are to be captured as events indicati ng

[IP_ADDRESS]  Definitions  
Per ICH, a n AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a pat ient or clinical 
investigation patient  administe red a pharmaceutical product and which d oes not 
necessarily ha ve a causal relationship  with th is treat ment. An AE can therefore be any 
unfavourable o r uninte nded sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding ), symptom, or 
disease temporally associated wit h the use of a medicinal (investigationa l) product, 
whether or  not related to the medi cinal (i nvestiga tional) product. The AE may be any of 
the follo wing : 
• A new illness  
Destiny Pharma pl c Clinical Pr otocol  v2.1 
XF-73B07 
CONFIDENT IAL  40 • An exacerbation of a sign or symptom or  the underlying condition or of a 
conc omitant il lness under treatment  
• Unrelated to parti cipation in the clinic al study or an effect of  the stu dy medic ation 
or comparator drug  
• A combination of [ADDRESS_167321]  dose of  
study drug, the AE will be considered a non -treatment emergent AE. An AE that occurs 
from the time the patient receives his/her first dose of study drug until his/her last study 
visit will be c onsidered a TEAE regar dless of the assessed re lationsh ip to th e 
administration of the study drug . 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that: 
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening  (Note : the term “life -threatening” refers to any AE that, as it 
occurs, puts the patient at  immedia te risk of death. It does not refer to an AE that 
hypot heticall y might have caused death if it were more severe).  
• Requ ires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_103296]  (not including 
hosp italization for a pre -existing condition that has not increase d in severity or 
frequency from the patient’s u nderlyin g medical condition prior to entry into the 
study) . Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34096], or r outinely scheduled treatment for 
a pre -existing condition that  has not worsened, is no t an SAE . 
• Result s in persistent or significant disability or in capacity  
• Is a con genital anomaly or birth defect  
• Is another  medically important condition  
 
An important me dical event that is not immediately life  threatening or will r esult in death 
or hospit alizatio n, but w hich may jeopardize the patient  or may require medical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed abov e, should be reported as “serious” 
as well.  
Medi cal and scientific judgment should b e exercised in decidin g whether a case is 
serious. 
“Occurring at any dose” does not imply that the patient  is receivi ng study drug at the time 
of the event.  
Destiny Pharma pl c Clinical Pr otocol  v2.1 
XF-73B07 
CONFIDENT IAL  41 Severity o f Adverse Event:  
Refers to the extent to which an A E affects the patient 's daily activi ties. Severity will be  
categorized accor ding t o the fo llowing criteria:  
Mild:  The AE does not interfere with the patient’s routine activities.  
Moderate:  The AE interfe res with the patient ’s daily routine, but usual routine 
activities can still be carried out. 
Severe:  The AE r esults in the inability to perfo rm routi ne activities.  
The term "severity" is used to describe  the intensity of an event. This is not the same as  
"serious". Seriousness, not severity, serves as  the guide for defining regulatory repor ting 
obligations. The highest severity grade a ttained should b e reported, for AEs with 
divergent severities.  
Causalit y of Adverse Event:  
Refers to the relationship of the AE to study drug. Causality will be reported  according to 
the following criteria:  
Not 
related:  Adverse eve nts for which a reasonab le expla nation f or an alternative cause 
is considered plausible , e.g., no study drug taken, plausible clinical 
alternative  like accidental injury, expected progression of  underlying or 
concomitant disease, phar macologically incompat ible temporal relationsh ip, 
or intercurr ent illness.  
Related:  Adverse events for which  a reaso nably possible clinical and/or 
pharmacological rela tionship to study drug cannot be excluded, e.g.,  lacking 
plausible alternatives.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Recor ding Adverse Events  
Patient  Enrolment to the F irst Adm inistrat ion of Study Drug: Non-treatment 
emergent AEs w ill be r ecorded from the time when the patient  is enrolled into the study 
(date of signature [CONTACT_146025])  until first adminis tration of study 
drug.  These events will be re corded i n the me dical history section of the eCRF . 
First Admini stration  of Study Drug to Patient 's Day 6 visit: Thereafter , all AEs are 
TEAEs and will be recorded until Day 6 visit has been performed.   
After Day 6: Only AEs that mee t SAE criteria and are c onsidere d relate d with the study 
medication by [CONTACT_145999] 6 through the final follow up 
visit. 
If an AE (serious or not) started during t he study but did not end before the fina l 
follow -up visit, the  Investigator should mak e a reas onable e ffort to establish the outcome 
and the end date . If thi s is not possible, the outcome recorded at the fina l follow-up visit 
will be assumed to be the fina l outcome.  
If an event stops and later r estarts, all the occur rences must be reported.  If in a patient  the 
same event changes in intensity over time  (e.g., diarrhoea  starting as mild turns into 
Destiny Pharma pl c Clinical Pr otocol  v2.1 
XF-73B07 
CONFIDENT IAL  42 severe) , only the most severe intensity will be recorded.  All AEs assessed as rela ted to 
study medicat ion by [CONTACT_941] I nvestigato r and all SAEs must be f ollowed up until  resolution.  
(e.g., value back to baseline valu e) or st abilization or until final database lock.  
Signs/sym ptom s should be documented if a definite diagnos is cannot be established. The 
Investigat or should attempt to e stablish a diagnosis of the even t based on signs, 
symptoms and/or other clinical inform ation. I n such cases, the diagnosis should be 
documented as  the AE and/or SAE and not the individual signs/ symp toms. If a diagnosis 
is accompanied by [CONTACT_139912], both the diagnosis itself  and the  symptom s will be 
reported . 
After Patient's Last Study Visit : The Investigator records and forwards to the Sponsor  
all SAEs that she or he becomes aware of and sh e or he considers related to the study 
drug. 
Laboratory values  that are outside the no rmal ran ge and considered clinically 
relevant in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_145968].  
If abnormal labo ratory values are signs of an AE (e.g., an infec tion) that has already been 
recorded, th e respective abnormal laboratory value does no t consti tute a s eparate AE.  
Whe rever reasonable the reporting I nvestiga tor will use the clinical term rather than the 
laboratory term (e.g., anaemia versus low haemoglobi n value). 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Responsibilities of the Invest igator  
The AE  data sho uld be obtained through observat ion of t he patient , from any information 
volunteered by  [CONTACT_102], or through patient  questioning. The general t ype of question 
asked could be similar to: “Do y ou have any health problems?” or “Have y ou had any 
health prob lems since your last cli nic visi t?” 
All AEs are to be documented/ recorded accurately an d comple tely on the AE pages of the 
respective eCRF and in the patient 's source data.  
All non -treatment an d TEAEs w ill be recorded  through Day 6. 
This is true even if t he study drug was not ad minister ed accor ding to the study protocol.  
For conditions lead ing to u nplanned surgical procedures the underlying conditi on, should 
be documented as an AE, but not the p rocedure. For withdrawals due to AEs  these 
should be captured in the CRF.  If the AE meets the criteria  of an SAE,  it should be 
reported to  as normal . 
Overdose needs to be captured as an AE  in the CRF and reported to  
if the AE meets the criteria of an SAE . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Responsibilities of the  Sponsor  
For purposes of  safety analyses  all AEs will be recorded in the clinical datab ase. To 
ensure expedited and periodic notification of autho rities, SAEs will also be recorded in 
the drug s afety database.  

Destiny Pharma pl c Clinical Pr otocol  v2.[ADDRESS_167322] unresolved AEs, clinically r elevan t laboratory parameters o r SAEs

to Day -1 prior to dose 1 ) 
10.1.3  Treatme nt Period (Day s -1 to Day  0) 
Patien ts who meet the entry  criteria will undergo the followin g treatment visits and 
assessments at timepoints designated on the Schedule of Assessments (Table  1.1). All 
assessme nts sho uld be completed prior to the dose of study drug.  Treatm ent visits will 
normally occur in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] , however  if more conven ient for the patient , home vi sits by 
[CONTACT_73290] d staff  working  to an agreed process will be allowed.  
 
It is normally expected that patients will continue as planned to their pre -determined 
surgery time and date after the initial pre -surgical doses of IMP in the previous 24 hours. 
However, in clinical p ractice surgery can be postponed at any point in the lead up to the 
planned sur gery time and date for different reasons and would not be consider ed a 
protocol deviation. If surgery is delayed, then the following  steps should be followed.  
• If the delay to th e planned incision timepoint is less than or equal to [ADDRESS_167325] be checked to be within its own 4 8hr expi[INVESTIGATOR_145970] a new kit assigned by [CONTACT_82550].  
• If the delay to the planned incision timepoint is greater than 48 hours but the 
patient’s new surgery date and time is still within their screening window, then 
existing IMP should b e replaced and a new kit assigned to the pati ent and full 
dosing regimen provided according to the protocol to the new timef rame. 
• If the delay to the planned incision timepoint is greater th an 48 hours and the 
patient’s new surgery date and time is outside  their screening window, then the 
patient sho uld be withdrawn. If time permits, the patient can be re -screened using 
a new scre ening number .

CONFIDENT IAL  60 14 ETHICAL, LEGAL AND ADMIN ISTRATIVE ASPECTS  
14.1 Good Clinical Practice  
The procedures set out in this study protocol are designed to ensure tha t the Sponsor and 
Investigator abide by [CONTACT_146018], a nd of the current 
version of the Declaration of Helsi nki (Brazil 2013) . The study als o will be carried out in 
keepi[INVESTIGATOR_145974].  
14.2 Infor med Consent  
Before each patient  is admitted to the study, a pre -screening nasal swab inform ed consent  
will be obtained from the  patient  (or his/her legall y authorized repres entative) acc ording 
to the regulatory and legal requirements of the participating c ountry ( i.e., the Declaration 
of Helsinki, ICH GCP, US Code of Fed eral Reg ulations for Prot ection of Human Patient s 
(21 Code Fe deral Regulation [CFR] 50.2 5 (a) and (b), CFR 50.27, and CF R Part 56, 
Subpart A), and other applicable local regul ations). If the  patient  is S. aureus  positive , 
he/she will be asked to sign the m ain ICF.  This consent for m mus t be dated and retained 
by [CONTACT_146019]. The  Investigator  will not undertake any 
investigation specifically requ ired only for t he clinical  study until valid co nsent has been 
obtained. The terms  of the consent and when it was obt ained must also be documen ted in 
the eCRF.  
If a proto col amendment is re quired, the ICF may need to be revised to reflect the 
changes to the  protocol. If t he consent form is revised, it m ust be reviewed and approved 
by [CONTACT_3433] e approp riate IEC/ IRB and  signed by  [CONTACT_143219] s subsequently  enrolled in the study 
as well as those curren tly enrolled in the study.  
14.3 Protocol Approval and Amendment  
Before th e start of the study, the study protocol and/or  other relevant documents will be 
approved  by [CONTACT_6179]/IRB/C ompetent A uthorities, in accordance with local legal 
requiremen ts. The Sponsor mus t ensure that  all ethical and legal requirements have been 
met befor e the first patient is enr olled in the study.  
This protocol is to be followed exa ctly. To  alter the protoc ol, amendm ents must be 
written, rece ive approval from the appro priate personnel, a nd receive 
IRB/IEC/Competent Authority approval prior to implementat ion (if appropr iate).  
Adm inistrative changes ( not affecting the patient  benefit/ risk rat io) may be made w ithout 
the need for a formal amendme nt. All amendments will be distributed to all protocol 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], with appropriate instructions.

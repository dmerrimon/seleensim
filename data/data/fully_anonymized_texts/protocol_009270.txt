1 STUDY SYNOPSIS  
Sponsor:  MicuRx Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Protocol Number:  MRX4 -201 
Study Drug:  Contezolid acefosamil for intravenous (IV) and oral (PO) administration  
Title:  A Phase 2, Multicenter, Randomized, Double -Blind Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of 
Contezolid Acefosamil  Compared to Linezolid Administered Intravenously and Orally to Adult s with 
Acute Bacterial Skin and Skin Structure Infection  
Phase of Development : 2 
Study Site:  Approximately 5 to 10 sites in the [LOCATION_002] (US)  
Indication:  Acute bacterial skin and skin structure infection (ABSSSI)  
Rationale:  There is an unmet need for additional antibiotic  choices to treat Gram -positive bacterial 
infections caused by [CONTACT_115942] -resistant Staphylococcus  aureus  (MRSA)  and 
vancomycin -resistant enterococci (VRE).  
Contezolid acefosamil  (previous ly referred to as MRX -4), a sodium salt of a contezolid (previously 
referred to as MRX -1) prodrug, is a synthetic antibiotic in the oxazolidinone class of antimicrobials. 
Due to the low solubility of contezolid and inability to produce a practical IV formulation using 
contezolid, an orally bioavailable and water soluble new molecular entity ( contezolid acefosamil ) was 
developed, a full battery of preclinical studies was performed , and a successful P hase [ADDRESS_129362] aerobic and anaerobic 
Gram -positive pathogens , with demonstration of clinical efficacy in ABSSSI in 2 previous Phase  2 
studies. Contezolid acefosamil , which rapi[INVESTIGATOR_115873], is e xpected to offer similar or 
more consistent (i.e., improved) pharmacokinetic (PK) properties  than other drugs in its class . 
Contezolid acefosamil  will be available in  both IV  and PO formulations . Therefore, contezolid 
acefosamil  may provide an attractive option to overcome the safety and tolerability challenges with 
current antibiotic choices in both the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_115874]. 
Both contezolid and contezolid acefosamil  have proven to be highly efficacious in various mode ls of 
animal infections caused by [CONTACT_6907] -positive bacteria, including drug- resistant strains of S. aureus, 
Streptococcus pneumoniae , and enterococci. The animal models used for evaluation included murine 
sepsis and thigh infection.  
This study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of IV and PO administered contezolid 
acefosamil  compared to linezolid  in adults with ABSSSI . The primary efficacy endpoint of clinical 
response at early assessment aligns with the current F ood and Drug Administration Guidance for 
Industry, ABSSSI: Developi[INVESTIGATOR_76508] ( FDA, October  2013 ). 
Study Objectives:  
Primary : 
• Evaluate early clinical response of contezolid acefosamil compared to linezolid at early assessment 
(EA; [ADDRESS_129363] dose of IV study drug)  in the intent -to-treat (ITT) 
population  
• Evaluate safety and tolerability of both contezolid acefosamil IV and PO formulations compared 
with linezolid  
Secondary : 
• Evaluate early clinical response at:  
- EA in the modified intent -to-treat ( MITT ) population  
- EA (overall and by [CONTACT_115943]) in the microbiological intent -to-treat (micro -ITT) 
population  
Clinical Protocol MRX4 -[ADDRESS_129364]  2018  
• Evaluate percent reduction in lesion size from baseline in ABSSSI lesions at Day 7 in the ITT and 
MITT popula tions  
• Evaluate the Investigator’s assessment of clinical response in the ITT, MITT, and clinically 
evaluable (CE) populations at each timepoint:  
- End of therapy (EOT; last day of study drug) in the ITT, MITT, and CE -EOT populations  
- Post therapy evaluation ( PTE; 7 to 14 days after EOT) in the ITT, MITT, and CE -PTE 
populations  
- Late follow -up (LFU; 21- 28 days after EOT) in the ITT, MITT, and CE -PTE populations  
• Evaluate per -subject microbiological response at:  
- PTE in the micro -ITT population  
- PTE in ME population  
• Evaluate per -pathogen microbiological response at:  
- PTE in the micro -ITT population  
- PTE in the ME population  
• Evaluate Investigator’s assessment of clinical response in the micro -ITT and ME populations at:  
- PTE (overall and by [CONTACT_115943])  
- LFU (overall  and by [CONTACT_115943])  
• Characterize the  PK of 3 contezolid acefosamil metabolites (MRX -1352, contezolid, and 
MRX -1320) using sparse PK sampling in adult subjects with ABSSSI  
• Evaluate composite assessment of clinical outcome (CACO) in the ITT, micro -ITT, and CE -PTE 
populations  
Study Design:  
This is a Phase 2, multicenter, randomized, double -blind safety and efficacy study of contezolid 
acefosamil 1500 IV x 1 dose , followed by 1000 mg IV every 12 hours (q12h) (±  2 hours) , for at least 
3 total IV  doses , followed by 1300 mg  PO q12h (±  2 hours) compared with linezolid 600 mg IV q12h 
(± 2 hours) , for at least 3 total IV doses,  followed by 600 mg PO q12h (±  2 hours) in adult subjects with 
ABSSSI . Subjects will receive study drug for a total of [ADDRESS_129365] 
a 2:1 ( contezolid acefosamil : linezolid)  allocation ratio ; therefore, up to 133 subjects will be randomized 
to receive contezolid acefosamil  and up to 67 subjects will be randomized to receive linezolid. Efforts 
will be made to enroll a mixture of ABSSSI types (cellulitis/erysipelas, wound infection, and major 
cutaneous abscess); however, subject s with major cutaneous abscess should not comprise >  30% of 
randomized subjects . Subject s will be randomized to treatment provided they meet all inclusion and no 
exclusion criteria. Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_115944].  
Screening/baseline  assessments for study eligibility will be performed  within [ADDRESS_129366] s for 
microbiologic evaluation at screening/baseline. ABSSSI site specimens (purulent discharge, skin 
biopsy, or aspi[INVESTIGATOR_115875]) in addition to blood cultures from 
[ADDRESS_129367]  2018  
Subjects may receive adjunctive antimicrobial therapy with parenteral aztreonam (1 to 2 g IV/ 
intramuscular [IM] q8h, not to exceed 6 g/day) if the Investigator suspects or has confirmed the 
presence of aerobic Gram -negative pathogens, wh ich, in addition to Gram -positive aerobic bacteria, are 
also associated with the pathogenic process.  
Subjects  with only Gram -negative pathogens are not eligible for  continued  treatment under this protocol 
and will be discontinued from study  drug as soon as  Gram stain and culture confirm s that the subject ’s 
infection has no Gram -positive  pathogen contributing to the subject ’s disease. If no Gram -negative  
pathogens  are isolated from the screening/baseline cultures by  [CONTACT_2006]  3, aztreonam will be discontinued. 
Subject s with suspected infections primarily due to anaerobic organisms as the cause for ABSSSI or 
subject s requiring empi[INVESTIGATOR_115876] . 
Prompt enrollment procedures are encouraged to allow for prompt administration of study drug. 
Subject s who received prior systemic antibacterial therapy with Gram -positive activity within 96  hours 
prior to randomization will be excluded from the study unless clear clinical evidence of prior treatment 
failure within the prior 96 hours is available. However, one exception to this criterion is the receipt of a 
single dose of a short -acting, non -oxazolidinone antibiotic (as provided in the study exclusion criteria 
and list of allowable antibiotics). Subject s who received a single dose of a short -acting non-
oxazolidinone Gram -positive  active antibiotic within 96  hours prior to randomization will not  comprise 
> 25% of randomized subjects . 
Randomized subject s will receive at least [ADDRESS_129368] s may receive the IV formulation for the entire treatment duration . Study 
treatment will be as follows:  
• Subject s randomized to contezolid acefosamil  treatment will receive IV infusion s of contezolid 
acefosamil  q12h (±  2 hours) for a minimum of 3 infusions  followed by 2 PO contezolid 
acefosamil capsules q12h (±  2 hours)  for a total of 10  to 14 days of treatment . The IV dose of 
contezolid acefosamil  will be 1500 mg infused over 60 minutes (±  5 minutes) for 1 dose 
followed by  1000 mg infused over 60 minutes (±  5 min utes); the PO dose of contezolid 
acefosamil will be 13 00 mg  (2 capsules each with 650 mg of contezolid acefosamil) . 
• Subject s randomized to linezolid treatment will receive  IV infusions of linezolid q12h 
(± 2 hours)  for a minimum of 3 infusions  followed by 2 PO linezolid  capsules q12h (±  2 hours)  
for a total of 10 to 14 days of treatment . The IV dose of linezolid will be 600 mg infused over 
60 minutes (±  5 minutes); the PO dose of linezolid will be 600  mg (2 capsules each with 
300 mg of linezolid) . 
It is expected that most subject s will remain in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_115877] a minimum of 3 total IV doses ; however , subject s who are clinically stable and have 
adequate home support with reliable transportation to/from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_115878] . Study drug IV infusions are not  to be administered at home . 
Subjects may  receive the IV formulation for the entire treatment duration. If the primary ABSSSI lesion 
has not increased in area from the screening/baseline assessment and the Investigator determines that 
the subject has sufficient PO intake of food and drink to safe ly support the administration of PO doses 
of antibiotics, the subject may be switched to the PO formulation. Subject s who are switched from the 
IV to the PO formulation must remain in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_115879] [ADDRESS_129369] day of study drug administration; su bsequent study days are consecutive calendar day s. 
For purposes of analysis, EA will be performed [ADDRESS_129370] calendar day of study drug  (+ 1 day) , PTE will occur [ADDRESS_129371]  2018

a PK sampling will be sparse . Samples will be collected after the first IV dose  and prior to and after the third 
IV dose (i.e. on Day 1 and Day 2) and at completion of therapy  (IV or PO), as described in the 
Pharmacokinetic Assessments section  (Section 11). 
 
 
Subject s must be evaluated directly by [CONTACT_737] (i.e., return to clinic for required assessments if 
being managed in the outpatient setting) from screening/baseline through  PTE. If  the subject  has 
improved to the point that they have returned to their usual premorbid activity (work/school) , and if the 
primary ABSSSI site has little or no pain, swelling, redness , or purulent/seropurulent  drainage at the 
PTE visit, the n the  LFU visit, designed to provide an assessment of durability of response , may be 
performed over the telephone.  
In addition, documentation of the primary ABSSSI lesion by [CONTACT_115945] /baseline , EA, Day 7, and EOT. All subject s will have their primary ABSSSI site evaluated by 
[CONTACT_737], including primary ABSSSI site measurements, as  described below. 
When conducting a clinical examination of the primary ABSSSI site, the Investigator will perform and 
record the following:  
• Extent of the infection (area in cm2) as measured by [CONTACT_94166], edema, or induration using 
manual measurement of the longest length multiplied by [CONTACT_115946], with a 
ruler provided by [CONTACT_1034]. Note that only measurement of the longest length and the greatest 
perpendicular width (and not calculation of area in cm2) will be collected and the area in cm2 will be 
calculated by [CONTACT_51084]. Instructions for primary ABSSSI measurements are provided in  
Appendix 5.  
• Local signs and symptoms of erythema (and any distant extension of erythema), swelling/edema, 
localized warmth, tenderness on palpation, drainage, fluctuance, and induration, as described in 
Appendix 6.  
In addition, record the following information at screening /baseline  only : 
• Primary a natomical site  
• Predisposing cause of infection , if any (e.g., trauma, arthropod bite, fungal dermatosis, surgery, 
spontaneous, etc.)  
Clinical Protocol MRX4 -[ADDRESS_129373]  2018  
Efficacy  assessments will include (see Section 9.1  for additional information) : 
• Early clinical response assessment based on the eCRF data at EA  where successful response ( i.e., 
"responder") is d efined as a reduction in primary ABSSSI lesion size ≥  20% compared to baseline, 
and the subject  did not receive a non- protocol specified systemic antibacterial agent with activity 
against Gram -positive organisms for the treatment of ABSSSI , and did not die of any cause up to 
EA. 
• Investigator ’s assessment of clinical response at  EOT  and PTE : Clinical success at EOT and PTE  is 
defined as resolution or near resolution of most baseline ABSSSI signs and symptoms , did not have 
any surgical procedure to treat the infection  after [ADDRESS_129374] Gram -positive organisms 
for the treatment of ABSSSI , and did not die of any cause up to EOT or PTE . 
• Investigator’s assessment of sustained clinical success and clinical relapse /failure  at LFU. Sustained 
clinical success is defined as no new signs or sym ptoms of primary ABSSSI after PTE. Clinical 
relapse /failure  is defined as new or worsened signs or symptoms of primary ABSSSI after PTE . 
Subject s who discontinue study drug  or withdraw from the study itself will undergo all EOT 
assessments on the day of study drug discontinuation or study withdrawal ( + 1 day). Subjects who 
discontinue study drug will remain in the study and complete all assessments specified for the PTE and 
LFU visits. For s ubject s who withdraw from the study , efforts will be made to perf orm follow -up safety 
assessments per study schedule.  The duration of treatment  within the s pecified window  will be 
determined by [CONTACT_115947] ’s clinical status (e.g., therapy can be discontinued if 
the subject  has improved, no more antibiotic treatment is medically necessary, and the risk of relapse is 
minimal ). 
Estimated Study Duration:  
Subjects  will receive study drug f or [ADDRESS_129375] ’s participation in the 
study will be up to 42 days, excluding the screening /baseline  visit that occurs within 24  hours prior to 
study drug administration on Day  1. 
Number of Subjects : 
Up to 200 (133 contezolid acefosamil :  67 linezolid ) adult subject s with ABSSSI will be enrolled in this 
study. Randomization will have a 2:1 (contezolid acefosamil  : linezolid ) allocation ratio with 
stratification for ABSSSI type.  
Study Drug, Dosage, and Route of Administration:  
The active study drugs are contezolid acefosamil  (IV and PO ) and linezolid (IV and PO ), which  will be 
administered for a total of 10 to 14 days. 
All subjects will start with IV therapy, with either contezolid acefosamil  1500 mg IV x 1 dose followed 
by 1000 mg  IV q12h (±  2 hours)  or linezolid 600 mg IV q12h (±  2 hours) , and all subjects  will receive 
at least 3 total doses of IV study drug . 
Subjects may receive the IV formulations for the entire treatment duration or be switched  to the PO 
formulations (after receiving at least 3 IV doses) to complete 10 to 14 days of treatment if the primary 
ABSSSI lesion has not increased in area from the screening/baseline assessment and the Investigator 
determines that the  subject ha s sufficient PO intake of food and drink to safely support the 
administration of PO doses of antibiotics.  
For subjects who switch from IV to PO treatment, 2 contezolid acefosamil  capsules  (each capsule 
containing 650 mg of contezolid acefosamil for a total of  1300 mg ) or 2 linezolid capsules (each capsule

Pharmacokinetic Assessments:  
This study will be conduc ted at multiple clinical sites, and some will have the appropriate equipment 
and facilities (including refrigerated centrifug es and - 70ºC  freezers) and experienced personnel to 
adequately collect, handle, store, and ship PK samples for bioanalysis . PK assessments will only be 
performed at selected clinical sites with this capability, and PK samples will be obtained from as many 
subjects as possib le at these selected sites. Drug exposure will be predicted based on demographic data 
(e.g., body weight) for subjects from whom PK samples were not obtained.  
• One PK sample after the 1st IV dose  (to characterize the loading dose) : obtain [ADDRESS_129383] infusion  
• Three  PK samples with the 3rd IV dose (to characterize drug exposure and approaching of steady 
state):  
• Obtain a  1st blood sample (trough level ) within [ADDRESS_129384] IV dose  
• Obtain a 2nd blood sample between 0.[ADDRESS_129385] IV dose  
• Obtain a 3rd blood sample between [ADDRESS_129386] IV dose but 
before the 4th dose (IV or PO) of study drug  
• Three  PK samples at EOT  (to evaluate potential drug accumulation) : 
• Obtain 1 blood sample ( trough level ) within [ADDRESS_129387] dose  (IV or PO) 
• If the last dose is given PO : obtain [ADDRESS_129388] dose  
• If the last dose is given IV: obtain [ADDRESS_129389] of  demographic  
characteristics (e.g., weight, body mass index, age, gender, race) upon the PK (including clearance ) of 
the drug  and its metabolites . Only those PK samples collected from subject s randomized to contezolid 
acefosamil  will be analyzed. The bio analytical laboratory will measure plasma concentrations of 
contezolid acefosamil  metabolites  (MRX -1352, contezolid , and MRX -1320) using validated and 
sensitive methods . 
Efficacy Endpoints:  
The Primary efficacy  endpoint is early  clinical response at EA for the ITT population as described in 
Efficacy Assessments above and in Section 9.1.1.  
Secondary efficacy  endpoints will be determined at EA, Day 7, EOT, PTE , and LFU according to the 
table below. Early  clinical response is  defined in Table 2, Investigator’s assessment of clinical responses 
(including success and relapse) are defined in Table [ADDRESS_129390]  microbiological responses are 
defined in Section  9.2.2, and microbiological responses per baseline pathogen are defi ned in 
Section  9.2.1 . The CACO is a composite assessment of the early  clinical response at EA and the 
Investigator’s assessment of clinical response at PTE (Section 12.6.2 .2).

Safety and Tolerability Assessments:  
Safety will be assessed through the determination and recording of the occurrence of  adverse events 
(AEs) and AEs of special interest, as well as by [CONTACT_115953], ECG parameters, and 
laboratory data. Hematology evaluations, serum chemistries, and urinalysis will be performed at 
screening /baseline , EA, Day  7 (±  1 day), EOT  (+ 1 day) , and PTE . Additional safety events that occur 
after PTE  will be assessed at LFU. Adverse events will be evaluated by [CONTACT_115954] . Serious adverse events (SAEs) will be identified.  
Stati stical Methods:  
Sample Size Considerations:  
This study is not powered for inferential statistical analysis. Up to 133  subjects (100 evaluable subjects) 
in the contezolid acefosamil group and up to 67 subjects (50 evaluable subjects) in the linezolid group 
will allow for planning of future studies. If the responder rate is 0.8 at EA using early  clinical response  
in the contezolid acefosamil group, then 133  evaluable subjects results in a 95% confidence  interval 
(CI) of (0.7 2, 0.86) for the responder rate.

2 INTRODUCTION 
2.1 Background  
Acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI) are common infectious diseases; 
approximately 6.3 million physician’s office visits per year are attributable to this infection 
(Pallin, 2008). The frequency and severit y of ABSSSI, and the emergence of resistance to many 
of the antibacterial agents commonly used to treat this infection, have dramatically increased 
over the past 2 decades ( Stevens, 2014). For example, there was a 29%  increase in  the total 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_115881] 2000 and 2004 ( Edelsberg, 2009). In addition, annual 
emergency department visits for ABSSSI between 1993 and 2005 increased from 1.2 million to 
3.4 million patients ( Pallin, 2009). Skin and soft tissue infection and ABSSSI in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_115882], as well as play 
an important role in driving antimicrobial resistance emergence ( Rennie, 2003).  
The increases in incidence and severity of ABSSSI are in part attributed to the emergence of 
community -associated methicillin -resistant Staphylococcus aureus  (MRSA) (Edelsberg, 2009 ). 
Commu nity-associated MRSA has increased markedly to become the greatest problem facing 
therapy for ABSSSI in the outpatient setting ( Deresinski, 2005; Diep, 2004; Eron, 2003). In a 
large global surveillance study to determine the bacteriology of ABSSSI between [ADDRESS_129416] as the predominant ABSSSI pathogen in all regions studied (North 
America, Latin America, and Europe); among the North American S. aureus  isolates, the 
prevalence of MRSA increased from approximately 42% in 1998 to 52% in 2004 ( Moet, 2007).  
In the same global surveillance study, the second most frequently isolated Gram-positive 
pathogen of ABSSSI was Enterococcus  spp., w here the prevalence remained high in North 
America (approximately  10%) (Moet, 2007). Furthermore, the prevalence of 
vancomycin -resistant enterococci (VRE) was of greatest concern in North America compared 
with other regions, where rates of resistance increased from approximately  9% in 1998 to 15% in 
2004. In addition to S. aureus  and enterococci, streptococci (e.g., group A, B, C, or G 
streptococci) and other staphylococci (e.g., coagulase- negative species) remain important causes 
of ABSSSI.  
It is important to note that ABSSSI may involve aerobic G ram-negative pathogens or may be 
polymicrobial ( Gram-positive, G ram-negative bacteria, and possibly anaerobic bacteria), 
depending on host factors and risk factors ( Stevens, 2014). Therefore, the goal of clinical 
evaluation of ABSSSI aims to establish the specific microbial cause to help determine optimal 
pathogen- directed therapy, which takes into account pathogen -specific and local antibiotic 
resistance patterns.  As most cases of ABSSSI are caused by [CONTACT_4727] G ram-positive cocci 
(i.e., staphylococci and streptococci) ―many of which may be drug -resistant―empi[INVESTIGATOR_115883]; recent emerging resistance of S. aureus  to methicillin, 
erythromycin, clindamycin, tetracycline, and trimethoprim -sulfamethoxazole―and emerging 
resistance of streptococci to erythromycin and clindamycin―have dramatically altered options 
of empi[INVESTIGATOR_115884].  
Clinical Protocol MRX4 -[ADDRESS_129417] oxazolidinone, was approved in 2000 and is highly 
efficacious for the treatment of both community -acquired and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_105484] 
(Wilcox, 2005). In the US, linezolid is indicated for the treatment of VRE infections (including 
cases with concurrent bacteremia), nosocomial p neumonia (caused by [CONTACT_115959] -sensitive S. 
aureus  [MSSA], MRSA, or S. pneumoniae , including multidrug- resistant [MDR] strains), 
uncomplicated and complicated skin and skin structure infections including diabetic foot 
infections without concomitant osteomyelitis (caused by [CONTACT_115960], MRSA, Streptococcus 
pyogenes , or S. agalactiae ), and community -acquired pneumonia c aused by S. pneumoniae , 
including MDR strains and cases with concurrent bacteremia, or MSSA  (Zyvox® Prescribing 
Information, 2018). There is an extremely low propensity toward developi[INVESTIGATOR_115885], even after over [ADDRESS_129418] to serious safety limitations, primarily due to myelosuppression and 
monoamine oxidase inhibition with associated drug -drug interactions, central nervo us system 
(CNS) and blood pressure effects. While myelosuppression is reversible and uncommon with 
linezolid treatment regimens ≤  14 days, extended treatment is also associated with mitochondrial 
toxicity resulting in optical neuropathy with rare but irrev ersible vision impairments ( Zyvox® 
Prescribing Information, 2018).  
In June  2014, tedizolid (Sivextro®), a second oxazolidinone was approved by [CONTACT_33438] ( FDA ) for the treatment of ABSSSI caused by [CONTACT_115960], MRSA,  various 
Streptococcus  species, and Enterococcus faecalis  (FDA, 2014). The availability of both oral 
(PO) and intravenous ( IV) formulations has added to their clinical utility, as have 
pharmacokinetic ( PK)/pharmacodynamic (PD) characteristics that offer, among other things, a 
bioavailability of 90 to  100%, possibility of once  daily (tedizolid) or twice  daily (linezolid) 
dosing, and excellent and prolonged tissue penetration ( Dryden, 2014; Flanagan, 2014).  
Introduction of new oxazolidinone compounds that are safe and effective, have a  PO and IV 
formulation, and have important differentiating features over existing agents are needed to 
ensure continued effective treatment of ABSSSI and other serious G ram-positive infections 
caused by [CONTACT_115961] G ram-positive pathogens.  
2.2 Description of Contezolid  and Contezolid Acefosamil  
MicuRx Pharmaceuticals , Inc.  pursued a research program to develop a novel oxazolidinone 
agent that maintains high antibacterial activity while potentially addressing the key toxicity 
issues associated with linezolid therapy. The initial drug candidate, contezolid (previously 
referred to as MRX -1), was well tolerated, safe, and shown to have efficacy com parable to 
linezolid ( Gordeev, 2014 ). Contezolid is a Biopharmaceutics Classification System (BCS) 
class  2 molecule (poorly soluble in water), and absorption of oral contezolid was markedly 
improved when administered with food. I n addition, the poor solubility made the production of 
an IV formulation impractical. To address these issues, contezolid acefosamil , a prodrug of 
contezolid, was developed to decrease the impact of food on oral absorption and to present the 
patient and ph ysician the opportunity to utilize the same molecular entity for both IV and oral 
therapy . The main objective of the contezolid acefosamil  and contezolid clinical program is to 
develop oxazolidinone antibiotic s with improved tolerability and reduced toxici ty compared to 
Clinical Protocol MRX4 -[ADDRESS_129419]  2018  
the currently available oxazolidinones (linezolid and tedizolid) while maintaining efficacy in 
serious G ram-positive bacterial infections.  
Contezolid acefosamil , the sodium salt of a  contezolid prodrug with high aqueous solubility , 
degrades into bioactive contezolid in aqueous environments in  a 2-step process  (Figure 1) . In the 
first step , contezolid acefosamil  quickly degrades i nto an intermediate metabolite, MRX -1352, 
when given either by [CONTACT_50906] (PO) or intravenous (IV) route , and the second step results in the 
active moiety, contezolid. Additionally, the primary metabolite of contezolid is MRX -1320. The 
structure of contezoli d has been previously published ( Gordeev, 2014). Neither contezolid 
acefosamil  nor MRX -[ADDRESS_129420] be converted to contezolid 
to become active. Neither contezolid acefosamil , nor MRX -1352, nor  the side chain fragments 
cleaved during biotransformation are associated with unique toxicities in animal models. 
Figure 1 : Contezolid Acefosamil  Metabolites  
 
The complete nonclinical toxicology program with contezolid acefosamil  demonstrated the 
following:   
• Whether given P O or IV, contezolid acefosamil has good tolerability and safety, and is 
comparable to contezolid in preclinical models of efficacy . 
• Contezolid acefosamil is well absorbed in animals as a PO  agent when dosed with and 
without food. 
A further description of the physical and chemical characteristics of contezolid and contezolid 
acefosamil is found in the Investigator’s Brochure. Contezolid acefosamil is expected to offer 
similar or  more consistent  (i.e., improved)  PK properties than contezolid and is expected to be 
available for both IV and PO administration in clinical practice. Therefore, contezolid acefosamil 
may provide an attractive option for ABSSSI and other significant Gram -positive infections in 
both hospi [INVESTIGATOR_115874].  
2.[ADDRESS_129421] both nosocomial and community Gram-positive pathogens. Oral absorption of 
contezolid  in the mouse, rat, and dog was rapid with maximum time to absorption (T max) of 0.5 
to 1 hour and a half -life (t 1/2) of 1  to 2 hours. The mean effective protective dose (ED 50) was 
similar to  linezolid in in vivo mouse models of systemic and local infections caused by [CONTACT_115962], 
penicillin -resistant S. pneumoniae , and VRE. Moreover, the minimum inhibitory concentration  
Contezolid  
Active moiety  

Clinical Protocol MRX4 -[ADDRESS_129422]  2018  
for 90% of microbial strains (MIC 90) is <  2 µg/mL against recent US  surveillance isolates 
(Li, 2014 ). 
After IV administration in rats, contezolid acefosamil  was rapi[INVESTIGATOR_115886] 30  minutes; the prodrug, contezolid acefosamil , was not detectable in rat blood specimens 
(whole blood supernat ant specimens). Peak concentrations of contezolid were demonstrated at  
0.7 hours. After multiple IV doses of 40 mg/kg contezolid acefosamil  in rats, no accumulation of 
the active molecule or its metabolites were noted over a 7- day period of consecutive 
administration s. Studies with radiolabeled 14C-MRX -[ADDRESS_129423] level ( NOAEL ) of contezolid acefosamil  for potential reproductive and/or 
developmental toxicity was 120 mg/kg/dose twice daily ( BID) in male and female rats. The 
NOAEL of contezolid acefosamil  for embryo -fetal development retardation was 40 mg/kg/dose 
BID (80  mg/kg/day: C max = 14,300 ng/mL, area under the curve [ AUC ]0-24h = 139,000 h ⃰ ng/mL 
on gestation day 17). Further details regarding the microbiology, and animal PK/PD of 
contezolid and contezolid acefosamil are available in the contezolid acefosamil  IB. 
With its improved solubility, contezolid acefosamil  is expected to offer similar or more 
consistent  (i.e., improved)  PK properties than contezolid, and can be administered by [CONTACT_115963]. The available in vitro microbiology and in 
vivo animal efficacy data support continued clinical development of contezolid acefosamil  as a 
potential human therapeutic agent for the treatment of moderate to severe bacterial infections 
caused by G ram-positive pathogens, most notably MRSA and other drug -resistant G ram-positive 
pathogens.  
2.4 Summary of Relevant Clinical Experience 
Contezolid is the active moiety of contezolid acefosamil . Several clinical studies were conducted 
with contezolid, including 2 Phase 1 clinical studies (MRX -I-01, MRX -I-02) and one proof -of-
concept Phase 2 clinical study  (MRX -I-03). From the Phase  [ADDRESS_129424] -
in-human study of PO contezolid acefosamil conducted in healthy volunteers  in the US  
(Section  6.2 of the Investigator’s Brochure ). MRX4 -[ADDRESS_129425] -in-human s tudy of IV 
contezolid acefosamil in healthy volunteers , and evaluated IV contezolid acefosamil 
administration and compared both the PO and IV administrations  (Section  6.3 of the 
Investigator’s Brochure ). An overview of the safety, tolerability, and PK from  these studies is 
presented below , with additional details provided in the Investigator’s Brochure.  
2.5 Safety and Tolerability of Contezolid Acefosamil  
In the Phase 1 contezolid acefosamil studies, safety and tolerability were assessed through 
adverse event reporting, collection of medical histories and concomitant medications, urine drug 
screens, urine and serum pregnancy tests, laboratory evaluations including hematology and 
coagulation tests, urinalyses, physical examinations, vital signs, and electrocardi ograms (ECG).  
In Study MRX4- 001, a total of 122 subjects were exposed to contezolid acefosamil or placebo 
administered orally in single doses of up to 3000 mg and multiple doses of up to 1500 mg every 
12 hours for 10 days. In Study MRX4 -002, a total of 98 subjects were enrolled, and 96 subjects 
were exposed to contezolid acefosamil or placebo administered via IV in single doses of up to 
2400 mg and multiple doses of up to 2100 mg QD for 10 days; 12 of 98 subjects also received 2 
doses of orally administered contezolid acefosamil 1500 mg q12h in the crossover portion of the 
study.  
In general, in both studies, contezolid acefosamil was well tolerated at these doses, and the safety 
profile of contezolid acefosamil was consistent with oxazolidinone  class effects . Findings 
included:  
• The majority of treatment- emergent adverse events ( TEAEs ) in both studies were mild in 
severity.  
• There were no severe or serious adverse events  (SAEs) or deaths . 
• There were no unusual or unexpected TEAEs judged related to study drug . 
• Overall, the nature and extent of TEAEs, and treatment -related TE AEs, were similar between 
all treatment groups for both PO  and IV administration, including placebo.  
• In Study MRX4- 001 (PO administration) , discontinuations due to TEAEs were observed in 
2 subjects (pyrexia in the 500 mg cohort, judged by [CONTACT_115964] 1500 mg cohort, judged possibly related to study drug). In Study 
MRX4 -002 (IV administration) , there were no discontinuations due to TEAEs; h owever, 
[ADDRESS_129426] 12 hours after receiving a single 
1500 mg oral dose and were judged possibly related to study drug . 
• Durin g PO administration (Study MRX4 -001), the most frequently reported treatment -related 
TEAEs in study Part 1 (single ascending doses of contezolid acefosamil or placebo) were 
Clinical Protocol MRX4 -[ADDRESS_129427] frequently reported treatment -related TEAE in Part 2 
(multiple ascending doses of contezolid acefosamil or placebo) was nausea. The most 
frequently reported treatment -related TE AEs during Part 3 (contezolid acefosamil or placebo 
and omeprazole) were headache, nausea, and vomiting. 
• During IV administration (S tudy MRX -002), the most frequently reported TEAEs for IV 
contezolid acefosamil and IV placebo involved the infusion site. In Part 1, only [ADDRESS_129428] frequently 
reported AEs relat ed to IV contezolid acefosamil were infusion site irritation and infusion 
site pain. In Part 3 (crossover portion investigating IV and oral formulations), the most 
frequently reported AE related to contezolid acefosamil was headache.  
• Two AEs of neutropenia  were reported in Study MRX4- 001 (all in subjects treated with PO 
contezolid acefosamil), and 3 in Study MRX4- 002 ([ADDRESS_129429] treated with placebo); all 5 events were National Cancer Institute 
(NCI)  Common Terminology for Adverse Event (CTCAE) Grade 2 (moderate) and none 
were judged related to study drug.  
• No impact of contezolid acefosamil administration (PO or IV) on laboratory values or ECGs 
interpretations was observed; no clinically significant l aboratory values were attributed to the 
study treatment, and there were no significant results on any ECG interpretation. 
• In general, contezolid acefosamil was well tolerated when given orally as a single 1500 mg 
dose in combination with omeprazole.

Sections 6.2 and 6.3 of the Investigator’s Brochure. 
2.6 Pharmacokinetics of Contezolid Acefosamil  
In Study MRX04- 001, t he PK of orally administered contezolid acefosamil was  evaluated after 
single ascending doses of 250, 500, 750, 1000, 1500, 2000, 2500, and 3000 mg (including an 
evaluation of food effect at the 1500 mg dose), multiple ascending doses of 500 mg q12h, 7500 
mg q12h, 1000 mg q12h, and 1500 mg q12h for 10 days, a nd in a crossover study alone at 
1500 mg and when co -administered with omeprazole.  
In Study MRX4- 002, t he PK of IV contezolid acefosamil was evaluated after single ascending 
doses of 150, 300, 600, 1200, 1800, 2100, and 2400 mg, multiple ascending doses of 600 mg 
q12h, 900 mg q12h, and 2100 mg QD for 10 days, and a crossover study comparing IV 
(2100 mg) and  oral (2 doses of 1500 mg tablets q12h) formulations of contezolid acefosamil. 
The general findings are described below.  
• Contezolid acefosamil was rapi[INVESTIGATOR_115887]. When contezolid acefo samil was administered orally, no quantifiable 
contezolid acefosamil concentrations were observed at any of the sampled timepoints, and 
therefore PK parameters for contezolid acefosamil could not be estimated. When 
Clinical Protocol MRX4 -[ADDRESS_129430]  2018  
administered via IV, blood concentrations  of contezolid acefosamil increased with dose and 
declined rapi[INVESTIGATOR_115888], with an estimated T 1/2 of 8 to 11 minutes. 
• Contezolid acefosamil concentrations were transient and very low after IV administration 
and undetectable after oral administr ation compared with those observed for the contezolid 
acefosamil metabolites.  
• Exposure to the active moiety, contezolid, in blood increased approximately dose -
proportionally with increasing oral and IV doses of contezolid acefosamil, particularly after 
multiple doses. During multiple dosing, there was no apparent accumulation for the  2100 mg 
QD IV regimen or for oral regimens of up to 1000 mg q12h; however, contezolid 
concentrations do gradually increase in systemic circulation over time as time to steady s tate 
may require up to 7 days when oral or IV contezolid acefosamil is dosed above 1000 mg 
q12h. Exposure after 10 days may increase up to 2 fold when dosed q12h given IV and up to 
1.7 fold when 1500 mg is given orally q12h.  
• Exposure to contezolid in blood after oral ly administered  contezolid acefosamil 1500 mg 
q12h (2 doses separated by 12 hours) was similar to that observed after contezolid acefosamil 
IV 2100 mg (single dose); the bioavailability of contezolid after orally administered 
contezolid acefosam il was approximately 66% of that after IV contezolid acefosamil. Based 
on relative amounts of MRX -1352, contezolid in blood and plasma, and MRX -1320 in 
plasma, there was no appreciable binding to blood components. 
• Although oral administration of contezolid acefosamil 1500 mg under fed conditions resulted 
in a delay in contezolid T max by [CONTACT_3450] 0.8 hours , from 2.42 hours to 3.25 hours, the 
maximum contezolid exposure (C max) was similar after administration of 1500 mg contezolid 
acefosamil under fed an d fasted conditions; the geometric mean ratio was 91.83%. An 
increase in total contezolid exposure (AUC 0-t, AUC 0-∞) of approximately 24% was observed 
in the presence of food; geometric mean ratios were 123.77% and 123.74%, respectively. 
Intrasubject variab ility ranged from 14.78% (AUC 0-∞) to 19.20% (C max). Therefore, the drug 
product can be taken with or without food. 
• After co -administration of contezolid acefosamil plus omeprazole, maximum contezolid 
exposure (C max) was approximately 20% higher compared to that after administration of 
contezolid acefosamil alone. Total contezolid exposure (AUC 0-t and AUC 0-∞) was similar 
across treatments. Intrasubject variability ranged from 16.49% (AUC 0-t) to 16.57% (AUC 0-∞). 
Therefore, no significant drug interaction is noted with concomitant omeprazole  treatment.  
• No clear gender -related trends were observed.

Sections 6.2 and 6.3 of the Investigator’s Brochure. 
2.[ADDRESS_129431]  2018  
Contezolid acefosamil , a sodium salt of a contezolid prodrug, is a synthetic antibiotic in the 
oxazolidinone class of antimicrobials. Due to the low solubility of contezolid and inability to 
produce a practical IV formulation using contezolid, an orally bioavailable and water soluble 
new molecular entity ( contezolid acefosamil ) was developed , a full battery of preclinical studies 
was performed , and a successful P hase [ADDRESS_129432] proven to be  highly efficacious in various 
models of animal infections caused by [CONTACT_6907] -positive bacteria, including drug- resistant strains of 
S. aureus , Streptococcus pneumoniae , and enterococci. The animal models used for evaluation 
included murine sepsis and thigh infection.  
The therapeutic benefit of linezolid (comparator) for the treatment of ABSSSI has been 
established ( Zyvox® Prescribing Information, 201 8). Based on linezolid prescribing information, 
contezolid acefosamil, an oxazolidinone, is contraindicated in patients with known 
hypersensitivity to oxazolidinones and in patients taking any monoamine oxidase inhibitors 
(MAOIs) or within 2  weeks of taking an MAOI. Warnings and precautions in the label include 
the risks for myelosuppression, peripheral and optic neuropathy, serotonin syndrome, 
Clostridium difficile -associated diarrhea, potential drug interactions producing hypertension, and 
hypoglycemia. Further information is provided in the contezolid acefosamil IB and can also be 
obtained from the prescribing i nformation for linezolid ( Zyvox® Prescribing Information, 2018). 
Refer to the IB for additional information. 
The current study is a Phase 2, multicenter, randomized, double -blind study designed to evaluate 
the safety and efficacy of IV and PO administered contezolid acefosamil compared to linezolid 
(Zyvox®) in adult subject s with ABSSSI. The study design incorporate s recommendations from 
the US Food and Drug Administration 2013 Guidance for Industry (ABSSSI: Developi[INVESTIGATOR_115889]) ( FDA, 2013). The primary efficacy endpoint of early  clinical response at early 
assessment aligns with the current FDA guidance. The secondary efficacy endpoint of the 
Investigator’s assessment of clinical response at PTE is based on current EU guidance ( EMA, 
2013). The safety parameters monitored during the study are well -accepted measures of safety in 
clinical study subjects . Contezolid acefosamil  PK concentrations will not be assessed in this 
study based  on Phase 1 study results indicating rapid conversion (within 0.25 hours) of 
contezolid acefosamil  to MRX -1352, an  intermediate metabolite of the prodrug, and subsequent 
conversion to active contezolid. Blood specimens will be collected to understa nd the PK 
performance of contezolid acefosamil  tablets used in this study population. The levels of the 
following contezolid acefosamil  metabolites will be assessed: MRX -1352, contezolid, and 
MRX-1320. 
Clinical Protocol MRX4 -[ADDRESS_129433]  2018  
2.8 Rationale for Dose Regimens  
The contezolid acefosamil dose regimen chosen for evaluation in this study is derived from 
3 lines of evidence:  
• From clinical PK/PD studies in the mouse thigh infection model.  
• From the Phase  1 studies in which administration of contezolid acefosamil was generally safe 
and well tole rated when administered to healthy volunteers at doses up to 2100 mg IV QD 
over 60 minutes for 10 days (MRX4 -002), and when contezolid acefosamil was administered 
at doses up to 1500 mg PO BID for 10  days (MRX4 -001).  
• Exposure of contezolid in blood after t hese respective doses was similar, the bioavailability 
of contezolid after contezolid acefosamil administered PO was approximately 66% of that 
after contezolid acefosamil administered via IV. And the exposure of 1000 mg of contezolid 
acefosamil IV q12h and 1300 mg contezolid acefosamil q12h by [CONTACT_115965] (contezolid) drug exposure when contezolid is given under optimal conditions. 
• From 2 Phase  2 studies which showed that contezolid dosed at 800 mg twice daily was 
non-inferior to l inezolid  600 mg given twice daily. 
The linezolid dose regimen is based on the  current prescribing information ( Zyvox® Prescribing 
Information, 2018).

3.2 Study Design  Details  
This is a Phase 2, multicenter, randomized, double -blind safety and efficacy study of contezolid 
acefosamil 1500 mg IV x 1 dose, followed by 1000 mg IV every 12 hours (q12h) (±  2 hours)  for 
at least 3  total IV doses , followed by 1 300 mg P O q12h (±  2 hours ) compared with linezolid 
600 mg IV q12h (±  2 hours)  for at least 3 total IV doses followed by 600 mg PO q12h 
(± 2 hours)  in adult  subject s with ABSSSI. Subjects will receive study drug for a total of 10 to 
14 days.  
Up to 200 subjects (133 contezolid acefosamil :  67 linezolid ) will be enrolled to achieve 
approximately 150 (100 contezolid acefosamil : 50 linezolid ) clinically evaluable subjects at 
approximately 5 to 10 sites with in the US  and randomized 2:1 ( contezolid acefosamil  : linezolid) 
for treatment of ABSSSI that is confirmed or suspected to be due to a Gram -positive bacterial 
pathogen. Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_115966].  Subject s will receive at leas t [ADDRESS_129437] s will receive study drug 10  to 
14 days as described in Section  3.5. 
Screening/baseline assessments for study eligibility will be performed within [ADDRESS_129438] s for 
micro biologic evaluation  at screening/baseline. ABSSSI site specimens (purulent discharge, skin 
biopsy, or aspi[INVESTIGATOR_115875]) in addition to blood cultures from 
[ADDRESS_129439]  2018  
identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing  (Section  8.2). Microbiological methods will 
be detailed in the Laboratory Manual.  
If Gram -positive and Gram -negative pathogens are suspected (Gram stain sug gests both a 
Gram -positive and Gram -negative pathogen) or proven from screening/baseline microbiologic 
laboratory results or history , the subject  will be eligible for treatment under this protocol. 
Subject s with both Gram -positive and Gram -negative pathoge ns will receive adjunctive 
antimicrobial therapy with parenteral aztreonam ( Section  5.1.3) . Subject s with only 
Gram -negative pathogens are not eligible for continued treatment under this protocol and will be 
discontinued from the study as soon as Gram stain or culture confirms that the subject ’s infection 
has no Gram -positive pathogen contributing to the subject ’s disea se. If no Gram -negative  
pathogens  are isolated from the screening/baseline cultures by [CONTACT_2006]  3, aztreonam will be 
discontinued. Subjects with suspected infections primarily due to anaerobic organisms as the 
cause for ABSSSI or subjects requiring empi[INVESTIGATOR_115890] . 
Prompt enrollment procedures are encouraged to allow for prompt administration of study drug. 
Subject s who received prior systemic antibacterial therapy with Gram -positive activity within 
96 hours prior to randomization are excluded from the study unless clear clinical evidence of 
prior treatment failure within the prior 96  hours is available ( Section  4.2). However, one 
exception to this criterion is the receipt of a single dose of a short -acting, non- oxazolidinone 
antibiotic ( Section 5.2) . Subject s who received a single dose of a short -acting non- oxazolidinone 
Gram -positive antibiotic within 96  hours prior to randomization will not comprise >  25% of 
randomized subjects . 
It is expected that most subject s will remain in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_115891] a minimum of 3  total IV doses ; however , subject s who are clinically stable 
and have adequate home support with reliable transportation to/fr om the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_115892]. Study drug IV infusions are not to be 
administered at home. Subjects may receive the IV formulation for the entire treatment duration. 
If the  primary ABSSSI lesion has not increased in area from the screening/baseline assessment 
and the  Investigator determine s that the subject has  sufficient PO intake of food and drink to 
safely support the administration of PO doses of antibiotics, subjects ma y be switched to the PO 
formulation. Subjects who are switched from the IV to the PO formulation of study drug must 
remain in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_115879] [ADDRESS_129440] may be discharged on PO medica tion only after good tolerability has been demonstrated 
with the initial dose of PO treatment ( Section  3.5).  
Subject s will undergo follow -up visits as described in Table [ADDRESS_129441] be 
evaluated directly by [CONTACT_115967]  (i.e., return to clinic for required assessments if being 
managed in the outpatient setting) from screening/baseline  through PTE. If the subject  has 
improved to the point that they have returned to their usual premorbid activity (work/school) , 
and if the primary ABSSSI  site has  little or no pain, swelling, redness or purulent /seropurulent  
drainage  at the PTE visit, the LFU visit may be performed over the telephone  (Section  8.1). 
Additionally, documentation of the primary ABSSSI lesion by [CONTACT_115945]/baseline and at various timepoints during and after study treatment ( Section  8.3). 
Clinical Protocol MRX4 -[ADDRESS_129442]  2018  
ABSSSI specimen G ram stain and cultures will be collected from the primary site of infection at 
each visit from EA  through LFU only if clinically indicated (e.g., the subject is deemed a cl inical 
failure  or relapse or purulence and discharge from the ABSSSI site continues after 
screening/baseline) . 
Subject s will be monitored for the occurrence of AEs throughout the study, including AEs that 
are associated with the oxazolidinone class of anti biotics. Physical examinations, vital signs, 
ECGs, and clinical laboratory tests ( hematology, chemistry , coagulation, and UA ) will be 
performed at screening/baseline and at various timepoints during and after study treatment 
(Table 1) . 
3.[ADDRESS_129443] s 
Up to 200 (133 contezolid acefosamil :  67 linezolid ) adult subjects with ABSSSI will be enrolled 
in this study. Randomization will have a 2:1 (contezolid acefosamil: linezolid) allocation ratio 
with stratification for ABSSSI type.  
3.4 Randomization  & Blinding  
Efforts will be made to enroll a mixture of ABSSSI types (cellulitis/erysipelas, wound infection, 
and major cutaneous abscess); however, subjects with major cutaneous abscess should not 
comprise > 30% of randomized subjects . Additionally, subjects who rece ived a single dose of a 
short -acting non- oxazolidinone Gram -positive antibiotic within 96 hours prior to randomization 
will not comprise > 25% of randomized subjects . 
Subjects will be randomized to treatment provided they meet all inclusion and no exclusion 
criteria (see Section 4.1 and Section 4.2, respectively). Subject s will be randomized using an 
interactive web response system ( IWRS ) to contezolid acefosamil  or linezolid  with a 2:1 ratio . 
Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_115968]  (cellulitis/erysipelas, wound infection, or 
major cutaneous abscess)  to better ensure proper balance between the treatment groups . After 
informed consent has been obtained and study eligibility established, the study site’s Pharmacist 
or Pharmacist’s desi gnee will obtain the study drug assignment from the IWRS . A subject  is 
considered randomized when the Pharmacist or Pharmacist’s designee receives the 
randomization number or study drug assignment . 
This is a double -blind study. Those blinded to study drug assignment include the Sponsor, 
Investigator, study statistician, clinical study personnel participating in direct subject  care, or 
those involved in clinical evaluations. Those unblinded to study drug assignment include the 
pharmacy personnel, the unblinded study monitor, and the bioanalytical laboratory. Blinded 
personnel must not make any effort to determine which study drug therapy is being administered. 
Blinded personnel will remain blinded to study drug assignment until all subject s have 
completed the  study and the database is locked. Procedures to ensure that the blind is maintained 
are detailed in the Study Procedures Manual.  
If study drug  is determined not to be safe and /or not  tolerated, the study drug assignment for 
those subject s with a significa nt safety concern may be unblinded. The Investigator and M edical 
Clinical Protocol MRX4 -[ADDRESS_129444] ’s medical management.  
Emergency unblinding should take place through the IWRS system for both IV and oral dos es, 
and both the Clinical Research Organization ( CRO ) and the Sponsor should be notified. Prior to 
any unblinding, the Investigator is strongly advised to discuss options with the Medical Monitor 
or appropriate Sponsor study personnel. If the blind is broken for any reason and the Investigator  
is unable to contact [CONTACT_115969], the Investigator must notify the Sponsor as 
soon as possible, without revealing the subject ’s study drug treatment assignment (unless 
important to the safety of subj ects remaining in the study) . All instances of unblinding  will be 
thoroughly investigated and documented by [CONTACT_115970] . 
3.5 Study  Treatment  
Study treatments include contezolid acefosamil  and linezolid  administered  as IV infusions 
followed by P O dosing  as follows : 
• Contezolid acefosamil  1500 mg IV will be infused over 60 minutes (±  5 minutes) for  [ADDRESS_129445] 2 IV doses of  1000 mg IV infused over 60 minutes (±  5 minutes) q12h 
(± 2 hours) for at least 3 total IV doses , followed by [CONTACT_115971]  1300 mg 
(2 capsules each with 650 mg of contezolid acefosamil) PO q12h (±  2 hours ), for a total of 
10 to 14 days of treatment . 
• Linezolid 600 mg IV will be infused over 60 minutes (±  5 minutes) q12h (±  2 hours) for at 
least 3 total IV doses , followed by [CONTACT_115972] 600 mg ( 2 capsules each of 300 mg linezolid) PO 
q12h (±  2 hours) , for a total of [ADDRESS_129446] s may be switched to the PO formulation if the primary ABSSSI lesion 
has not increased in area from the baseline/screening assessment and the Investigator d etermines 
that the  subject has  sufficient PO intake of food and drink to safely support the administration of 
PO dos es of antibiotics ; however, subject s may receive the IV formulation for the entire 
treatment duration . It is expected that most subject s will remain in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_115893] a minimum of 3  total IV doses ; however , subjects  
who are clinically stable and have adequate home support with reliable transportation to/from the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_115894]. Stu dy drug IV 
infusions are not to be administered at home. Subject s who are switched from the IV to the PO 
formulation of study drug must remain in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_115895] [ADDRESS_129447] s randomized to contezolid acefosamil  will receive 2 capsules 
(650 mg each) q12h (±  2 hours) , and subject s randomized to linezolid will receive  2 capsules 
(300 mg  each)  q12h (±  2 hours) . Additional treatment information is provided in Section  5. 
Subjects  are to  receive 10  to 14 calendar days of study drug. The duration of treatment within the 
specified window will be determined by [CONTACT_115973] t’s clinical status 
(e.g., therapy can be discontinued if the subject  has improved, no more antibiotic treatment is 
medically necessary, and the risk of relapse is minimal).  
Prior to any premature discontinuation of study drug, the study site personnel should notify the 
Medical Monitor if the subject ’s medical condition allows (see Section  4.[ADDRESS_129448] s who prematurely discontinue study drug or study).

5.1.[ADDRESS_129465]  2018  
The following study drug compliance information will be documented as study i nformation and 
reported in the  electronic case report form ( eCRF ): 
• The dates and times of administration of each IV study drug  infusion.  
• For IV infusion, the infusion start and stop times  will be recorded , and specify if the total 
volume of study drug solution was administered (if infusion is halted or interrupted for any 
reason, record the time of premature discontinuation and re -initiation of infusion) . An 
unblinded member of the st udy staff will inspect t he infusion line and bag at the end of 
infusion to confirm that the full dose has been infused, followed by a rapid IV push to clear 
any residual study drug in the line. Infusion bags will be retained by [CONTACT_115980] s tudy close -out monitoring visit by [CONTACT_115981]. 
• The total volume infused for IV infusion, and number of capsules  administered for PO 
administration . 
For a ny infusion that is incomplete or otherwise not adm inistered over 60 minute s (± 5 minutes) , 
the actual volume infused, infusion duration, and conditions or complications that prevented 
complete and/or timely administration must be documented.  In any case, study site personnel 
should strive to administer the entire dose regardless of the inter -current problems of  drug  
administration . 
Recording of the date and whether each dose of study drug was administered will be used to 
document compliance with the assigned dosing regimen for oral drug . Subject s managed as 
outpatients will be given diaries to log times and dates of study drug administration; this 
information will be entered in the eCRF.  The determination of blood concentrations of 
contezolid acefosamil  (and metabolites) during the analytical phase will serve as a further check 
of compliance.  
5.1.6 Study Drug Storage  
Unused study drug supplies should be stored according to the directions on the study drug labels. 
• Contezolid acefosamil : Lyophilized contezolid acefosamil  (for IV formulation) must be 
stored in a secure area (e.g., a locked freezer), protected from moisture, and kept at or below

In addition, the following medications are not allowed from 2 weeks prior to administration of 
study drug through EOT (Section  4.2): 
• Systemic  adrenergic, dopaminergic, or serotonergic medications ( Appendix 3)  
• Any MAOI ( e.g., isocarboxazid, isoniazid, nialamide, phenelzine, procarbazine, and 
hydracarbazine)  
Concomitant topi[INVESTIGATOR_115896], other than study drug and adjunctive 
parenteral aztreonam, is not allowed between screening/baseline and PTE (unless the subject  is a 
clinical failure) . 
The following additional adjunctive therapy is a llowed, as clinically indicated:  
• Daily dressing changes  
• Topi[INVESTIGATOR_115897]  (e.g., povidone -iodine); 
however, topi[INVESTIGATOR_115898] (e.g., mupi[INVESTIGATOR_19190], 
retapamulin, fus idic acid)  
• Surgical debridement  
• Hyperbaric oxygen treatments  
• Surgical interventions ( i.e., incision and drainage, aspi[INVESTIGATOR_115899], or excision with or 
without grafting) planned at the initiation of treatment through [ADDRESS_129470] s are required to:  
• Avoid taking any of the following concomitant medications between  Day 1 (first  
administration of study drug)  and EOT  (last calendar day of study drug ). 
○ Any adrenergic, dopaminergic, or serotonergic medication, including selective serotonin 
reuptake inhibitors ( SSRIs ) or tricyclic antidepressants  (Appendix 3) .

use of topi[INVESTIGATOR_115902]  (e.g., povidone -
iodine) are allowed . 
○ Note : While hypoglycemic medications are not contraindicated, such agents (e.g., insulin 
or PO  hypoglycemic) should be used with caution. Postmarketing cases of  symptomatic 
hypoglycemia have been reported in subject s with diab etes mellitus receiving 
hypoglycemic age nts when treated with linezolid. While a causal relationship  between 
linezolid (or other oxazolidinones) and hypoglycemia has not been established, diabetic 
subject s should be cautioned of potential hypoglycemic  reactions when treated with study 
drug. If hypoglycemia occurs, a decrease in the dose the  hypoglycemic agent, or 
discontinuation of the hypoglycemic agent  and/or study drug  may be required.

7 STUDY PROCEDURES  
The schedule of events is provided in Table 1.  
• Written informed consent must be obtained prior to initiating any study assessment or 
procedure.  
• It is expected that most subject s will remain in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_115904] a minimum 3  infusions ; however , subject s who are clinically stable and have 
adequate home support with reliable transportation to/from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_115905]. Study drug IV infusi ons are not to be 
administered at home. Subject s who are switched to the PO formulation of study drug must 
remain in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_115906] [ADDRESS_129474] PO dose, 
and until the initial dose(s) of the PO formulation  are clearly tolerated  in the judgment of the 
Investigator  (Section  3.5).  
• All assessments and  procedures on dosing days are obtained pre dose, unless otherwise 
specified . 
• After screening/baseline, microbiological assessments (ABSSSI site and/or blood cultures) 
should be repeated only if clinically indicated ( e.g., if a subject is deemed a clinical failure or 
if purulence and discharge from the ABSSSI site continues after screening/baseline).  
• Refer to Section 4.[ADDRESS_129475] s who prematurely discontinue study drug or the 
study.  
7.1 Screening /Baseline  
Study eligibility  must be confirmed within [ADDRESS_129476] administration of stud y 
drug. The following screening /baseline  assessments and procedures will be performed ≤[ADDRESS_129477] dose  (see Table [ADDRESS_129478] dose of study drug is administered > 24 hours after the screening/baseline assessments) :

samples.  All ECGs will be performed using the ECG machines provided by [CONTACT_115982] (eRT)  and will be sent to eRT for central reading . 
• Assess, identify, and record any AEs or SAEs from the time the informed consent is signed.  
• Perform microbiological assessments  (see Section  8.2); additional microbiological specimen 
collection and processing details are available in the Laboratory Manual:  
○ Obtain appropriate ABSSSI site specimen for bacterial culture and Gram stain from all 
subjects  and refer the specimens for Gram stain and culture to the local laboratory for 
processing. The ABSSSI site specimen should be obtained before administration of 
antibacterial therapy whenever possible. Repeat ABSSSI specimen cultures and Gram 
stain at subsequent visits only if clinically indicated ( e.g., if subject is deemed a clinical 
failure or purulence and discharge at the ABSSSI site continues after screening/baseline ). 
○ Obtain 2 sets of blood cultures (each consisting of 1 aerobic and 1  anaerobic blood 
culture bottle from 2  separate venipuncture sites) from all subject s. The blood cultures 
should be obt ained before administration of antibacterial therapy, whenever possible. 
Blood cultures must be repeated every 3 days (±  1 day) if the previous blood culture was 
positive, or at any time after screening/baseline if clinically indicated. If the repeat blood 
culture remains positive with the bacterial pathogen initially isolated , the Investigator 
must consider modifying the subject ’s antibiotic therapy  and discuss the case with the 
Medical Monitor . 
• Record if the subject ’s premorbid activities (work/school) are compromised  
• Obtain samples for laboratory assessments (see Appendix 4 for specific tests ). Laboratory 
samples for screening/baseline will be drawn and sent to both the local laboratory (for 
eligibility) and to the  central laboratory.

2 years postmenopause . (Alternatively, females must be surgically sterile, i.e. , have had a  
tubal ligation, hysterectomy, or bilateral oophorectomy.)  
○ Obtain the subject’s estimated CrCl. T he subje ct’s estimated CrCl will be calculated by 
[CONTACT_12082] (for eligibility purposes) using screening/baseline height (m), actual 
weight (kg), and serum creatinine:  
Males:  
CrCl =  (140 – age in years) × weight (kg)  
 72 × serum creatinine (mg/dL)  
 
Females:  
CrCl =  (140 – age in years) × weight (kg) × 0.85  
 72 × serum creatinine (mg/dL)

Clinical Protocol MRX4 -[ADDRESS_129513] the following:  
• Extent of the infection (area in cm2), as measured by [CONTACT_94166], edema, or 
induration using manual measurement of the longest length multiplied by [CONTACT_115948], with a ruler provided by [CONTACT_1034]. Note that only measurement of 
the longest length and the greatest perpendicular width (and not calculation of area in cm2) 
will be collected and the area in cm2 will be calculated by [CONTACT_51084]. Instructions for primary 
ABSSSI measurements are provided in Appendix 5. 
• Local signs and symptoms of erythema (and any distant extension of erythema), 
swelling/edema, localized warmth, tenderness on palpation, drainage, fluctuance, and 
induration as described in Appendix 6.  
In addition, record the following information  at screening/baseline only : 
• Primary a natomical site  
• Predisposing cause of infection, if any (e.g., trauma, arthropod bite, fungal dermatosis, 
surgery, spontaneous, etc.)  
8.[ADDRESS_129514] undergo 
microbiological assessments (i.e., ABSSSI site specimens and blood cultures) at 
screening/baseline and these samples  should be obtained from all subjects prior to administration 
of antibacterial therapy whenever possible.  
The screening/baseline microbiological assessments are critical, in that microbiological response 
is an important s econdary outcome of the study ( Section 3.1). Also, the antibacterial spectrum of 
study drug ( contezolid acefosamil  or linezolid) is limited to G ram-positive pathogens ( e.g., 
staphylococci and streptococci); therefore, it is important to determine whether non -Gram-
positive pathogens are involved in the ABSSSI , in addition to G ram-positive pathogens . 
Adjunctive parenteral aztreonam should be adminis tered for confirmed or suspected aztreonam -
susceptible aerobic G ram-negative pathogens as causes of the ABSSSI in addition to G ram-
positive pathogens  (Section  5.1.3) ; however, subject s with suspected G ram-negative pathogens 
only (e.g., infection caused by [CONTACT_115986] a subject  with severe burns) must be 
excluded. Similarly, polymicrobial ABSSSI involving anaerobic organisms must be excluded 
from the study , as empi[INVESTIGATOR_115910]- anaerobic activity are not al lowed , and subject s 
Clinical Protocol MRX4 -[ADDRESS_129515]  2018  
with suspected or known mycobacterial or fungal ABSSSI are not eligible for study entry 
(Section  4.2).  
The met hod used for obtaining a microbiological ABSSSI site specimen for Gram stain and 
culture depends on the ABSSSI type:  
• For cellulitis, obtain a specimen by [CONTACT_80605][INVESTIGATOR_115911], edema, or induration for Gr am stain and aerobic bacterial culture. 
• For wound infection, obtain a deep -site tissue specimen (e.g., tissue biopsy) or needle 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_115912].  
• For major cut aneous abscess, obtain purulent material during the drai nage procedure for 
Gram  stain and aerobic bacterial culture.  
Superficial swabs of infected areas are not acceptable, due to the high probability that such 
specimens could be contaminated with clinical ly insignificant, and therefore misleading, isolates. 
However, deep swabs taken during significant surgical interventions are acceptable.  
In addition, 2 sets of blood cultures (each consisting of 1 aerobic and 1  anaerobic blood culture 
bottle from 2 separate venipuncture sites) will be collected from all subject s, regardless of 
location of management (inpatient  or outpatient). The blood cultures should be obtained before 
administration of antibacterial therapy, whenever possible. Blood cultures must be repeated 
every 3 (±  1) days if the previous blood culture was positive , or at any time after 
screening/baseline if clinically indicated . If the repeat blood culture remains positive with the 
bacterial pathogen  initially isolated , the Investigator must consider modifying the subject ’s 
antibiotic therapy and discuss the case with the Medical Monitor.  
After screening/baseline, microbiological assessments (ABSSSI site and/or blood cultures) 
should be repeated only when clinically indicated (e.g., at  EOT if study drug is prematurely  
withdrawn for insufficient clinical effect [ clinical failure ] at the time of relapse or recurrence 
after EOT , or if purulence and discharge from the ABSSSI site continues after 
screening/baseline).  
For all  microbiological specimens (ABSSSI site and blood), Gram stain, and culture  should be 
performed at the local laboratory according to local standards of care. If bacterial growth occurs 
from culture, the isolate(s) must be sent to the central laboratory for confirmation of  organism 
identity (to genus and species level) and susceptibility. Refer to the Laboratory Manual for 
specific procedures pertaining to the collection, processing, storage , and shipment of bacterial 
isolates . 
Antimicrobial susceptibility testing should be  performed at the local laboratory according to 
local standards of care; all clinically significant G ram-positive pathogens should be tested locally 
for linezolid susceptibility, as appropriate. Note that susceptibility testing for contezolid 
acefosamil  will not be available at the local laboratory. After the cultured isolates are sent to the 
central laboratory, the central laboratory will test all G ram-positive isolates for both linezolid and 
Clinical Protocol MRX4 -[ADDRESS_129516]  2018  
contezolid acefosamil  susceptibilities. Staphylococcus aureus  will also be tested for oxacillin 
susceptibility as a marker for methicillin resistance by [CONTACT_115987]. All 
clinically significant non -anaerobic G ram-negative isolates will be tested for aztreonam 
susceptibility by [CONTACT_115988] l and local laboratories.  
The local laboratory should retain all isolates until confirmation of a viable organism is received 
from the central laboratory. Back up cultures will be requested when the central laboratory does 
not receive a viable culture, or  recovers an organism different from the one recorded by [CONTACT_27396]. Refer to the Laboratory  Manual for additional details.  
8.3 Digital Photography  
Documentation of the primary ABSSSI lesion by [CONTACT_115945]/baseline, EA , Day 7, and EOT  using the digital camera provided by [CONTACT_1034] . 
Investigators must follow the specific digital photograph procedures that are detailed in the 
Infection Site Assessment and Measurement Manual  and Appendix  7.

9.2 Microbiological Response Definitions  
9.2.1 Per-Pathogen Microbiological Response  
A microbiological outcome at the PTE vi sit will be determined in the micro -ITT and ME 
populations  for each pathogen isolated from the ABSSSI site or blood at screening/baseline. 
Microbiological outcome categories include  eradication, presumed eradication, persistence, 
presumed persistence, and indeterminate, as defined in  Table 4 . Favorable microbiological 
outcomes include  eradication or presumed eradication. Unfavorable microbiological outcomes 
include  persistence or presumed persistence.  
Table 4:  Microbiological Outcome Categories  
Outcome  Category  Definition  
Eradication  An adequate source specimen demonstrates absence of the original 
screening/baseline  pathogen  
Presumed eradication  An adequate source specimen was not available to culture and the subject  was 
assessed as a clinical success by [CONTACT_115989]/baseline  pathogen  
Presumed persistence  An adequate source specimen was not available to culture and the subject  was 
assessed as a clinical failure by [CONTACT_115990] ’s 
clinical response was assessed as indeterminate  
9.2.[ADDRESS_129522]  based on individual outcomes for each screening/baseline 
pathogen. For  a subject  to have a favorable per -subject  microbiological response, the outcome 
for each screening/baseline pathogen must be favorable (eradicated or presumed eradicated , as 
defined in Table 4 ). For  a subject  to have an unfavorable per -subject  microbiological response, 
the outcome for a screening/baseline pathogen must be unfavorable (persistence, presumed 
persistence, as defined i n Table 4 ). If the same pathogen is isolated from multiple sites (e.g., 
blood and ABSSSI site culture), the worst response will be used to determine the per -subject  
microbiological response. 
9.2.[ADDRESS_129523] appearing after screening/baseline will be categorized as 
either superinfections or new infections as defined in Table [ADDRESS_129524]  2018  
Table 5:  Emergent Infections  
Category  Definition  
Superinfection  Isolation of a new pathogen(s) (other than the original screening/baseline 
pathogen[s]) from the prim ary ABSSSI site and from an appropriate ABSSSI 
specimen which is accompanied by [CONTACT_115991] , based on the Investigator’s assessment of clinic al response.   
New infection  Isolation of a new pathogen(s) (other than the original  screening/baseline 
pathogen[s])  from the primary ABSSSI site and  from an appropriate ABSSSI 
specimen which is accompanied by [CONTACT_115992] , based on the Investigator’s 
assessment of clinical response.  
ABSSSI  = acute bacterial skin and skin structure infection; EOT  = end-of-therapy  
Clinical Protocol MRX4 -[ADDRESS_129525] that are associated with the oxazolidino ne class of antibiotics . 
Electrocardiograms, hematology evaluations, chemistry, coagulation, and UA will be performed 
at screening/baseline and at various timepoints during and after the dosing period ( Table 1 ). Each 
recorded AE will be described by [CONTACT_13662] (i.e., start and end dates), severity, seriousness, and 
suspected relationship to the study drug. Adverse events will be graded as mild, m oderate, or 
severe, as detailed in Section 10.1.2_Assessment_of_Severity . Relationship of the AE to stud y 
drug will be characterized as related  (including possibly related or definitely related) and 
unrelated , as detailed in  Section  10.1.3. 
As detailed in Section 3.4, if study drug is determined not to be safe and tolerated, the study drug 
assignment for those subject s with a signifi cant safety concern may be unblinded after discussion 
between the Investigator and Sponsor. The blind may also be broken in the case of a medical 
emergency requiring the Investigator to know the identity of the study drug to appropriately 
guide the subject ’s medical management. Prior to any unblinding, the Investigator is strongly 
advised to discuss options with the Medical Monitor or appropriate Sponsor study personnel. If 
the blind is broken for any reason and the Investigator is  unable to contact [CONTACT_115993], the Investigator must notify the Sponsor as soon as possible, without revealing the 
subject ’s study drug treatment assignment (unless important to the safety of subject s remaining 
in the study). All instances of unblinding will be t horoughly investigated and documented by [CONTACT_115994] . 
Reports of AEs will be collected for all subject s from the  time informed consent is signed.  The 
Investigator  will assess all AEs and SAEs and record the following information on the 
appropriate eCRF page:  
• Date and time  of onset  
• Date of resolution or stabilization  
• Severity  
• Relationship to study drug 
• Action taken with study medication  
The Investigator  should disti nguish between local and systemic AEs . An example  of a possible 
systemic AE include s generalized rash or pruritus related to an allergic reaction . An example of a 
possible local AE include s a focal  rash or irritation that is localized to a cutaneous area 
surrounding a venous blood draw . 
Clinically indicated laboratory tests (emergency or unscheduled tests) should be conducted at the 
local laboratory.  For example, laboratory workup of an AE of anemia could include iron tests, 
reticulocyte count, and blood s mear, among other local laboratory tests. The Investigator  should

10.[ADDRESS_129527] medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether 
or not considered drug related. An AE  can be any unfavorable or unintended sign, symptom, or 
disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, without any judgment about causality . 
Adverse events are collected from the time the informed consent is signed.  
An AE does not  include the following:  
• Medical or surgical procedures (e.g. , surgery, endoscopy, tooth extraction, transfusion); the 
condition that necessitates the procedure is an AE . 
• Any pre -existing  disease or condition, or laboratory  or ECG  abnormality , present or detected 
prior to administration of study drug  that does not worsen.  
• Laboratory  or ECG  abnormalities without clinical manifestations, which do not require 
medical inter vention, or that do not result in termination or delay of study medication (see 
Section 10.2_Reporting_ Laboratory_and  for further detail).  
• Situations where an untoward medical occurrence has not occurred (e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10800], social, or convenience admissions) . 
• Overdose of any study drug or concomitant medication without any signs or symptoms, 
unless the subject  is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_115913].  
• Worsening of the primary ABSSSI for which the subject was enrolled . 
10.1.2 Assessment of Severity 
Severity of AE s will be assessed by [CONTACT_115995], moderate, or severe ( Table 6 ). 
This assessment is subjective and the Investigator  should use medical judgment to com pare the 
reported AE to similar types of events  observed in clinical practice.  It is important to recognize 
that severity is not equivalent to event seriousness  (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]) . 
Clinical Protocol MRX4 -[ADDRESS_129528]  2018  
Table 6:  Guidelines for Severity Assessments  
Severity  Definition  
Mild  Symptom(s) barely noticeable to the subject, transient, or does (do) not make the 
subject uncomfortable. The AE does not influence regular, daily performance or 
functioning (e.g., functioning at work or school). Special treatment (e.g., with a 
prescription drug) is not ordinarily required for relief of symptom(s).  
Moderate  Symptom(s) of a suff icient severity introduce a low level of inconvenience or concern 
to the subject. The AE may alter regular, daily performance or functioning (e.g., 
functioning at work or school), but is ameliorated with simple therapeutic measures.  
Severe  Symptom(s) of a sufficient severity to cause the subject severe discomfort, interrupt 
daily activities, or lead to cessation of administration of study drug. Treatment for 
symptom(s) is needed. A severe AE does not necessarily qualify as an SAE 
(Section  [IP_ADDRESS]).  
 
10.1.[ADDRESS_129529] make an assessment of the relationship of the event 
to the study  drug using the following scale:  
• Unrelated : The event is definitely not associated with administration of study drug , and is 
judged clearly due to causes other than the study drug . 
• Possibly related  (Suspected Adverse Reaction [SAR]) : A causal relationship between the 
study drug and the AE  is at least a reasonable possibility, i.e. the relationship cannot be ruled 
out. This implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than a definitely related AE. 
Additional evidence to suggest a SAR includes:  
○ Indivi dual occurrences of uncommon AEs that are known to be strongly associated with 
drug exposure (e.g., angioedema, blood dyscrasias, rhabdomyolysis, hepatic injury, 
anaphylaxis, Stevens -Johnson Syndrome) . 
○ One or more occurrences of an AE that is uncommon in t he study population, but not 
commonly associated with drug exposure (e.g., heart valve lesions in young adults, 
intussusception in healthy infants) . 
• Definitely Related  (Adverse Reaction) : A causal relationship between the study drug and the 
AE is definite . 
These criteria, in addition to good clinical judgment, should be used as a guide for determining 
the causal assessment. If the event is believed to be unrelated to administration of study drug , 
then an alternative explanation should be provided. 
Clinical Protocol MRX4 -[ADDRESS_129530]  2018  
10.1.4 Serious A dverse Event s 
An SAE is defined as any adverse experience occurring at any dose of study medication that 
occurs between the time informed consent is signed and within 30 days after the final 
administration of study drug that results in any of the following  outcomes:  
• Death  
• Life-threatening situation ( subject  is at immediate risk of death)  
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (excluding hospi[INVESTIGATOR_115914] t he 
underlying primary ABSSSI lesion ) or prolongation of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] 
• Persistent or si gnificant disability/incapacity  
• Congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of a subject  who received study drug 
• Events that jeopardize the subject  suffic iently that medical or surgical intervention may be 
required to prevent one of the above outcomes  (e.g., bronchospasm requiring urgent 
management in an emergency room, blood dyscrasias that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], 
seizures that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059])  
[IP_ADDRESS] Serious Adverse Event Reporting 
The Sponsor has requirements for expedited reporting of SAEs meeting specific criteria to 
worldwide regulatory authorities. Therefore, the Sponsor must be notified immediately regarding 
any SAE that occurs af ter administration of study drug. All SAEs must be reported to the  
Medical Monitor wit hin 24 hours  of the investigational site’s knowledge of the event.  
The study site will transmit a SAE Report (SAER) by [CONTACT_6968] (preferred) or facsimile (back up) to 
InClin Drug Safety . An initial report can be made via telephone in the case of an urgent event or 
question, but a completed SAER must still be emailed or faxed within 24 hours of the site’s 
knowledge of the event. The investigational site will be provided with SA ER forms wherein the 
following information is requested. In addition, relevant eCRF pages should be appended to 
communicate relevant study drug and subject outcome information. The information needed for 
completing an SAER is as follows : 
• Subject  identifica tion, Investigator name, and site number . 
• SAE information: event term, onset date, severity, and causal relationship. 
• The outcomes attributable to the event (e.g., death, a life -threatening AE, in patient  
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], prolongation of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1838], a persistent or significant disability 
or incapacity, or other important medical event[s]) . 
Clinical Protocol MRX4 -[ADDRESS_129531]  2018  
• A summary of relevant test results, pertinent laboratory data, and any other relevant medical 
history . 
• The first and last dates of administration of study dr ug. NOTE: As this is a double -blind 
study, SAERs should not indicate specific study drug assignments . 
• Indicate if the study drug was discontinued or if the administration of study drug schedule 
modified . 
• Supplemental information may include the following h ospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097]: laboratory results, 
radiology reports, progress notes, admission and emergency room notes, holding and 
observation notes, discharge summaries, autopsy reports, and death certificates . 
The SAER should be faxed within 24 hours  with as much of the above information as available 
at the time. The following minimum information is required for reporting an SAE: subject  
identification, reporting source, and an event or outcome. Supplemental information may be 
transmitted using a follow -up report and should not delay the initial report. The Sponsor may 
contact [CONTACT_115996] -up on the event.  
The Investigator must take all therapeutic measures necessary for resolution of the SAE. Any 
medications  or procedures necessary for treatment of the SAE must be recorded on the 
appropriate pages of the eCRF.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  “Serious” V ersus “Severe” Adverse Events  
To avoid confusion or misunderstanding over the difference between the terms "serious" and 
"severe," which ar e not synonymous, the following note of clarification is provided (excerpted 
from International Council for Harmonisation [I CH] E2A ): 
The term "severe" is used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event (as in mild, 
moderate, or severe myocar dial infarction); the event itself, however, may be of relatively minor 
medical signific ance (such as severe headache).  This is not the same as "serious," which is based 
on subject /event outcome or action criteria usually associated with events that pose a  threat to a 
subject 's life or functioning. Seriousness (not severity) serves as a guide for defining regulatory 
reporting obligations. 
[IP_ADDRESS] SAE Definition Clarifications  
• Death is an outcome of an AE, and not an AE in itself . 
• All deaths during administration of study drug or occurring within [ADDRESS_129532] be reported using the 
SAER . 
• “Occurring at any dose” does not imply that the subject  is actively receiving study dru g at the 
time of the event . 
Clinical Protocol MRX4 -[ADDRESS_129533]  2018  
• “Life -threatening” means that the subject  was at immediate risk of death from the event as it 
occurred. This does not include an event that might have led to death, had it occurred with 
greater severity.  
• Complications that occur  during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_98176]. If an AE prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], 
it is an SAE.  
• “Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” means the subject  has been formally admitted to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_99325], for any length of time. This may or may not be overnight. It does not 
include presentation and care within an emergency department (although an emergency 
department visit may define a medically  important event, which is also considered an SAE).  
• The Investigator  should attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, 
symptoms, and other clinical information. In such cases, the diagnosis should be documented 
as the AE or SAE, rather t han as the individual signs or symptoms. 
10.1.5 Treatment -emergent Adverse Event  
A treatment -emergent adverse event ( TEAE ) is defined as an AE that occurs during or after the 
first administration of study drug and up through the last study visit or evaluation, or  an SAE that 
occurs during or after the first  administration of study drug up through [ADDRESS_129534] caused death.  
10.1.7 Unexpected Adverse Event  
An AE is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in the IB or is not listed at th e specificity or 
severity that has been observed; or, if an IB is not required or available, is not consistent with the 
risk information described in the general investigational plan. For example, under this definition, 
hepatic necrosis would be unexpected (by [CONTACT_14213]) if the IB referred only to 
elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis. Similarly, cerebral thromboembolism and cerebral 
vasculitis would be unexpected (by [CONTACT_14214]) if the IB listed only cerebral 
vascular accidents. "Unexpected," as used in this definition, also refers to AEs that are mentioned 
in the IB as occurring with a class of drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties 
of the drug, but are not specifically mentioned as occurring with the particular drug under 
investigation.  
Some AEs are listed in the IB as occurring with the same class of drugs, or as anticipated from 
the pharmacological properties of the drug, even though they have not been observed with the 
drug under investigation.  Such events would be considered unexpected until they have been 
observed with the drug under investigation. 
Clinical Protocol MRX4 -[ADDRESS_129535]  2018  
10.2 Reporting Laboratory and Electrocardiogram Abnormalities  
Laboratory and ECG abnormalities should not be recorded as AEs unless they are associated 
with clinical signs or symptoms, or require medical intervention. However, laboratory and ECG 
abnormalities (e.g., clinically significant changes detected on clinical chemistry, hematology, 
UA, etc.) independent from the underlying medical condition that re quire medical or surgical 
intervention, or lead to study drug interruption or discontinuation, must be r ecorded as an AE if 
applicable.  If the laboratory abnormality is part of a clinical condition or syndrome, it should be 
recorded as the syndrome or diag nosis rather than an isolated laboratory or ECG abnormality. In 
addition, laboratory and ECG abnormalities or other abnormal test assessments that are 
associated with signs or symptoms must be recorded as AEs if they meet the definition of an AE 
(or SAE).  
10.[ADDRESS_129536] be either postmenopausal for ≥ 2 years or surgically sterile 
(having undergone tubal ligation, hysterectomy, or bilateral oophorectomy) or, if of childbearing 
potential, must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test (β –HCG) at screening/baseline and 
be willing to use a highly effective method of contraception throughout the study such as 1 of  the 
following:  
• Hormonal contraception (stable dose for 3 months)  
• Intrauterine device/ intrauterine hormone -releasing s ystem  
• Barrier contraceptive method (diaphragm, cervical cap, contraceptive sponge, condom)  
Additionally, m ales (if sexually active and non sterile) with female partners of  childbearing 
potential must use 2 methods of contraception (i.e., a barrier contraceptive such as condom with 
spermicidal foam) , and be willing to continue to use these same birth control measures while 
participating in the  study (and for 70 days following participation in the study). Males must also 
refrain from sperm donations during this time. 
Female subject s must be instructed to inform t he Investigator immediately if they be come 
pregnant during the study.  Male subject s must also be instructed to inform the Investigator 
immediately if a female partner becomes pregnant through at least 70  days (10 weeks) after 
dosing. In the event of a confirmed pregnancy, the following actions should be taken:  
• Study drug should be stopped immediately . 
• The pregnancy should be reported to the  Medical Monitor within 24 hours  of notification 
using the Pregnancy Report Form.  
• The I nvestigator should counsel the subject  regarding the possible effects of prior study drug 
exposure on the fetus and the need to inform the study site of the outcome of the pregnancy . 
Clinical Protocol MRX4 -[ADDRESS_129537]  2018  
• The subject  must be monitored until the immediate post- natal period or until  termination of 
the pregnancy. The outcome should be reported to the Medical Monitor using the Pregnancy 
Outcome  Form. 
Pregnancy is not an AE, in and of i tself.  However, any pregnancy complication or elective 
termination of a pregnancy for medical reasons wil l be recorded as an AE or SAE. A  
spontaneous abortion is always considered an SAE and will be reported as described in the AE 
and SAE sections. Furthermore, any SAE occurring as an adverse pregnancy outcome post -study 
must be reported to the Medical Monitor. 
10.[ADDRESS_129538]  stabilized, will be categorized as such in the database.  
Non-serious AEs that are ongoing at the end of the study will be identifi ed as ‘Ongoing’ .

study ( Section 4.5). The study may be temporarily suspended or terminated should the 
Investigator, Sponsor, or IRB determine that the safety of study subjects is significantly 
jeopardized. The decision for a temporary or per manent study hold will depend on the nature, 
frequency, and severity of AEs that were observed in all enrolled subjects to date. In a temporary 
study hold, no additional subjects will be enrolled into the study or dosed with study drug until 
the study team  (including the Investigator and the Medical Monitor) decides it is safe to proceed 
with the study. The study will be terminated or temporarily suspended if any of the following 
events occur in a single subject who is receiving active contezolid acefosamil  (as determined 
after unblinding) during the study period:  
• Hy’s law criteria met ; these are defined as elevations of ALT or AST  to > [ADDRESS_129540]  and 
elevation of serum total bilirubin to ≥  [ADDRESS_129541] with  serum alkaline phosphatase  < [ADDRESS_129542] 
abnormalities  (FDA, 2009)  
• Clinically significant cardiac arrhythmia (e.g., Torsade de Pointes)  
• Symptomatic anemia with a hemoglobin level <  8.0 g/dL, as confirmed  on repeat testing, or 
requirement for blood transfusion 
• Platelet count <  50 x  103/mm3, as confirmed on repeat testing 
• WBC count <  2.0 x  103/mm3 or absolute neutrophil count <1,000/mm3, as confirmed on 
repeat testing  
• Rash defined as an SAE ( Section 10.1.4)  
Clinical Protocol MRX4 -[ADDRESS_129543]  2018  
• Peripheral or optic neuropathy  
• Serotonin syndrome  
• Seizure 
• Anaphylaxis or allergy -related angioedema  
As noted above, safety assessments will be monitored and evaluated on a regular basis by [CONTACT_58860], and any abnormal clinical or laboratory findings or trends will be closely monitored 
and followed regardless of severity or causality (e.g., before an event reaches a severe grading 
level or reaches a termination criterion cutoff).  
10.[ADDRESS_129544] the appropriate 
equipment and facilities (including refrigerated centrifuges and - 70ºC freezers) and experienced 
personnel to adequately collect, handle, store, and ship PK samples for bioanalysis. PK 
assessments will only be performed at selected clinical sites with this capability, and PK samples 
will be obtained from as many subjects as possible at these selected sites. Drug exposure will be 
predicted based on demographic data (e.g., body weight) for subjects from whom PK samples 
were not obtained.  
• One PK sample after the 1st IV dose (to characteriz e the loading dose): obtain [ADDRESS_129545] infusion 
• Three PK samples with the 3rd  IV dose  (to characterize drug exposure and approaching of 
steady state) :  
○ Obtain a 1st blood sample (trough level) within [ADDRESS_129546] IV dose  
○ Obtain a 2nd blood sample between 0.[ADDRESS_129547] IV dose  
○ Obtain a 3rd blood sample between [ADDRESS_129548] IV dose but 
before the 4th dose (IV or PO)  of study drug . 
• Three PK  samples  at EOT  (to evaluate potential drug accumulation) :  
○ Obtain 1 blood sample (trough level)  within [ADDRESS_129549] dose (IV or PO)  
○ If the last dose is given PO: obtain [ADDRESS_129550] dose  
○ If the last dose is given IV: obtain [ADDRESS_129551] IV dose and the final dose  (IV or PO) . Additionally, given the range of demographic 
data in the expected subject population, these PK data will be used to perform exploratory 
analyses on the impact of demographic characteristics (e.g., weight, body mass index , age, 
gender, race) upon the PK (including clearance) of the drug and its metabolites. Only those PK 
samples collected from subject s randomized to contezolid acefosamil  will be analyzed.  
The bioanalytical  laboratory will measure plasma concentrations of contezolid acefosamil  
metabolites  (MRX -1352, contezolid, and MRX -1320)  using  validated  and sensitive  bioanalytical 
methods . Specific instructions for the collection of plasma drug concentration specimens  will be 
provided in the Laboratory M anual and  should be reviewed prior to collection.

All data will be summarized  separately by [CONTACT_5349] ( contezolid acefosamil  or linezolid). 
Descriptive statistics ( number, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum) will 
be presented for continuous variables for each study drug. Frequency distributions (count s and 
percentages) will be presented for categorical variables.  Listings will be provided for individual 
subject  study data.  
A comprehensive Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be prepared and finalized prior to database 
lock. 
12.[ADDRESS_129553] e Size  
This study is not powered for inferential statistical analysis. Approximately 133  subjects 
(100 evaluable subjects) in the contezolid acefosamil group and 67 subjects (50 evaluable 
subjects) in the linezolid group will allow for planning of future studies. If the responder rate is 
0.8 at EA using early clinical response in the contezolid acefosamil g roup, then 133 evaluable 
subjects results in a 95% confidence interval (CI) of (0.72, 0.86) for the responder rate.

12.6.1 Primary Efficacy Evaluation  
The primary efficacy analysis is a n examination  of the number of responders in the contezolid 
acefosamil  treated group vs the number of responders in the linezolid group at EA in the ITT 
population. This aligns with the FDA’s primary efficacy endpoint of interest in ABSSSI studies 
(FDA, 2013 ). Subject s will be programmatically categor ized into responders, non- responders or 
indeterminate based on the eCRF data as previously discussed in Section 9.1.1. Subject s who are 
lost to fol low-up or who have missing data will be classified as indeterminate. The number of 
responders, non -responders, and indeterminate responses will be summarized by [CONTACT_115998] a n exact  95% CI will be provided for the responder rates in each treatment group. The 
difference between the responder rates will be calculated and 95% CI  for the difference between 
response rates will be calculated  using a Wald continuity correction.

Early c linical response at EA  will be classified programmatically based on eCRF data as 
previously discussed in Section 9.1.1. The number and percentage of subject s classified 
programmatically as a responder, nonresponder , and indeterminate  at EA will be tabulated for 
the populations specified in Table 8  for both treatment groups , and the difference in response 
rates will be summarized along with the 95%  CI for the rate of response.  
The Investigator’s assessment  of clinical response will be classified as previously discussed in 
Section  9.1.2. The number of subject s with an Investigator’s assessment of clinical success, 
clinical failure , and indeterminate at EOT  and PTE  will be tabulated for both treatment groups 
for the populations specified in Table 8  (by [CONTACT_108], subject s with an indeterminate response 
will be excluded  from summaries in the CE -EOT and CE- PTE populations). The 95%  CI will be 
provided for the rate of clinical success for each treatment group. The difference in clinical 
success rates will also be summarized. The 95%  CI will be provided for the difference  in rates of 
success at PTE in the ITT  and CE -PTE populat ions only , which are the primary analyses of 
interest in the EU ( EMA, 2013) . The durability of clinical response (rate of sustained clinical 
response and clinical relapse/failure ) at LFU will be summarized by [CONTACT_115999] -ITT and ME populations. 
The rates of success as assessed by [CONTACT_116000] ( Table 9 ) will be summarized in the ITT, micro -

The number and percentage of subject s with favorable microbiological responses will be 
summarized  at PTE in the ME and micro -ITT populations. R esponses include eradication, 
presumed eradication, persiste nce, presumed persistence, and indeterminate  (Table 4 ). To have 
an overall favorable microbiological response, the outcome for each baseline pathogen must be 
favorable. Of these responses, eradication and presumed eradication will be re garded as a 
favorable outcome. Persistence and presumed persistence will be regarded as an unfavorable 
outcome. If a subject  has > [ADDRESS_129563] 95% CI will be constructed for the percentage

Safety will be evaluated by [CONTACT_116004], vital signs, laboratory evaluations 
(hematology , chemistry, and coagulation) , and ECG parameters.  For each safety paramete r, the 
last assessment made prior to the first administration of study drug will be used as the baseline 
for all analyses.  
The incidence of TEAEs (defined in Section 10.1.5) will be presented by [CONTACT_116005] ( MedDRA®); by [CONTACT_2946], PT, and relationship to 
study drug ; and by [CONTACT_2946], PT, and severity.  In addition, the incidence of SAEs and TEAEs 
leading to discontinuation of study drug will be presented by [CONTACT_2946] , PT, and relationship to study 
drug. If the incidence of SAEs and TEAEs leading to discontinuation of study drug is low, only a 
listing will be provided.  
Descriptive statistics of vital signs at each timepoint measured, as well as the change from 
baseline and potentially clinically significant changes , will be presented  by [CONTACT_1570] . 
Potentially clinically significant changes will be defined in the SAP. Descriptive statistics for 
ECGs will also be presented for each timepoint measured. Descriptive statistics for clinical 
laboratory tests and for the change from baseline will be presented by [CONTACT_116006].

an exclusion criterion ( Section 4.2) ; however, subject s may be eligible for the study despi[INVESTIGATOR_115920] a single dose of a non -oxazolidinone, short -acting 
systemic antibiotic within [ADDRESS_129582] s may be 
eligible despi[INVESTIGATOR_115921] 1) objective clinical evidence of treatment 
failure such as persistent pain, erythema, induration, and/or purulent drainage (if present) 
following at least 48  hours  of prior, non- study, systemic antibacterial therapy ; and 2) 
microbiological evidence of failure (i.e., a Gram stain obtained from an appropriate ABSSSI 
specimen collected after the initiat ion of this prior therapy revealing WBC and Gram -positive 
cocci, or isolation of a Gram -positive pathogen from an appropriate ABSSSI specimen that is 
resistant to the prior systemic antibacterial therapy) . 
For the purposes of this protocol, short -acting is  defined as having a dosage frequency of more 
than QD. The allowed and disallowed antibacterials  listed in Table 10  are based in part from the 
antimicrobial agents listed in the 2014  Infectious Diseases Society of America ( IDSA )

Appendix 2.  Avoidance of High -Tyramine Foods and Drinks  
As linezolid and other oxazolidinones are MAOIs , a significant pressor response has been 
observed in normal adult subjects receiving linezolid and concomitant tyramine doses of 
> 100 mg ( Zyvox® Prescribing Information, 2018 ); therefore, subject s receiving linezolid or 
contezolid acefosamil  need to avoid consuming  large amounts of foods or beverages with 
high-tyramine content. Foods high in tyramine content include those that may have undergone 
protein changes by [CONTACT_23067], fermentation, pi[INVESTIGATOR_115903], or smoking to improve flavor, such as aged 
cheeses, fermented or air -dried meats, sauerkraut, soy sauce, and tap beers ( Table 11 ). The 
tyramine content of any protein- rich food may be increased if stored for long periods or 
improperly refrigerated.  
The following table of high- tyramine foods and drinks to avoid in large amounts  during study 
drug administration in this study has been modified from "Meal Ideas and Menus: Avoiding 
High -tyramine Foods Made Easy" ( Holden, 2006 ), and serves as a general guidance. Questions 
as to whether additional foods or beverages must  be avoided should be directed t o the Medical 
Monitor.

Appendix 3.  Restricted Medications  
Oxazolidinones are reversible, nonselective MAOIs; therefore, they have the potential for 
interaction with adrenergic and serotonergic agents  (Zyvox® Prescribing Information, 2018) . 
Exclusion Criterion 17 states that prior (within the past 2 weeks) or expected/required 
concomitant (from the start of the study drug to EOT) administration of systemic adrenergic or 
serotonergic medications are excl uded ( Section  4.2). Such agents include the following:  
Adrenergic Agents  
Adrenergic agents, including indirect -acting sympathomimetic agents, vasopressors, and 
dopaminergic agents, should be used with caution when administered concomitantly with 
oxazolidinones― patients  receiving concomitant linezolid may experience a reversible 
enhancement of the pressor response to such adrenergic agents  (Zyvox® Prescribing Information , 
2018) . Example s of s uch agents include:  
• Adrenergic receptor agonists ; examples include dobutamine, dopamine, epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] 
(adrenaline), norepi[INVESTIGATOR_238], phenylpropanolamine, pseudoephedrine  
• Norepi[INVESTIGATOR_62965] ; examples include b upropi[INVESTIGATOR_115928]  
• Azapi[INVESTIGATOR_115929] ; examples include b uspi[INVESTIGATOR_115930] , including fatal cases , have been  reported  with the 
co-administration of linezolid  and serotonergic agents  (e.g.,  antidepressants such as SSR Is). 
Symptoms and signs of serotonin syndrome include hyperthermia, rigidity, myoclonus, 
autonomic instability, and mental status changes that include extreme agitation progressing to 
delirium and coma. In this study, study drug ( contezolid acefosamil  or linezolid)  should not be 
administered to patients taking any  of the following medications: 
• Serotonin re uptake  inhibitors (SSRIs) ; examples include paroxetine, sertraline, fluoxetine, 
fluvoxamine, and citalopram  
• Tricyclic antidepressants ; examples include cl omipramine and imipramine  
• Serotonin 5- HT1 receptor agonists  (triptans ); examples include almotriptan, eletriptan, 
frovatriptan, naratriptan, rizatriptan, sumatriptan, and zolmitriptan

Appendix 7.  Recommended Instructions for Primary ABSSSI Site Digital Photography  
Digital photographs of the primary ABSSSI site will be taken with digital cameras provided by 
[CONTACT_941] S ponsor as described below .  (IMPORTANT NOTE: Depending upon the location of the 
infection site on a  subject’s face or body, a  digital image may include certain unique features that 
could reveal the subject’s identity. In order to protect and preserve patient privacy, please 
obscure or cover any unique features of the subject (such as eyes, nose or tattoos) prior to 
capturing the  digital image .) 
1. Drape area behind subject  with a white sheet.  
2. Place disposable ruler on the skin adjacent to the lesion. Define outer edge of erythema, 
edema, or induration, whichever is largest, with a marker at each visit. 
3. Using the ruler or another pie ce of paper, place identifying information (date, subject  
number, body part) adjacent to the lesion. 
4. Position camera approximately 2  feet (60  cm) from the lesion.  
5. Take a pi[INVESTIGATOR_115933] a 90 -degree perpendicular angle from the lesion. 
6. Do not use any zoom settings.  
7. Turn the flash setting to “Off” if enough light is available from other sources. Otherwise, use 
the flash on auto exposure setting . 
8. Use rest of camera’s automatic settings for focus and lighting . 
9. Place a light source on each side of the subject  to help  prevent shadows.  
10. Capture at least a [ADDRESS_129591]  to indicate the 
border of the viewing field of each photograph.  
11. After the digital photograph is taken, confirm on the camera screen that the pi[INVESTIGATOR_115934], in 
focus, and that all information on the ruler, including the ruler scale, is visible and legible

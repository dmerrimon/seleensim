Final Protocol, [ADDRESS_855146] been a leading 
cause of meningitis, bacteremia, pneumonia, and acute otitis media (AOM) and continue to 
be a major global pub lic health concern. Serious pneumococcal disease may  occur at any  
age;however, children <5 y ears and adults  65 years of age are at particularly  increased risk.  
Individuals with certain comorbidities and immunocompromising conditions are also at risk. 
Data from t he Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC )estimated that in 201 5
there were 29,500 cases and 3350 deaths due to invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD)in 
persons of all ages in the [LOCATION_002]. Spneumoniae remains an important cause o f serious 
disease in the U nited States and worldwide .
The Spneumoniae pol ysaccharide capsule has been identified as an important virulence 
factor for this pathogen. While there are more than 95 pneumococcal seroty pesdifferentiated 
by [CONTACT_639272], a subset ismore commonly  associated with 
severe disease.   Pneumococcal disease can be prevented with poly saccharide -based vaccines 
that induce antibod y responses with functional (opsonophagocytic) activity and target the 
capsular s erotypes responsible for disease.  Thelicensed 23 -valent pneumococcal 
polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23), however, has
substantial disadvantages because it 
contains poly saccharides in an unconjugated manner with its inherent limitations in terms of 
quantity  and quality  of immune responses. T he incidence of IPD due to the serot ypes unique 
to PPSV23 has remained relativel ystable or slightly  increased over the past 15 y ears, despi[INVESTIGATOR_639252]23 in adults  65years of age and high
-risk 
adults. Therefore, unconjugated poly saccharide vaccines have significant limitations.
Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines ,which contain poly saccharide antigens covalentl y linked 
to a protein carrier ,elicit a T -cell–dependent immune response inducing p rotective responses 
in young children, older adults, and populations with high -risk conditions.
Prevnar,licensed in the U nited States in 2000, and Prevnar 13 ,licensed in the United 
States in 2010, are pneumococcal conjugate vaccines containing [ADDRESS_855147] demonstrated 
efficacy /effectiveness against vaccine
-type (VT) IPD, AOM, and pneumonia in infants and 
older adults.  They  also have demonstrated the ability  to reduce nasophary ngeal carriage and 
transmission, resulting i n indirect beneficial effects.
However, there continues to be pneumococcal disease due to other serot ypesnot included in 
either Prevnar or Prevnar 13 in various age groups and in different parts of the world. Seven 
seroty pes, 8, 10A, 11A, 12F, 15B, 22F, and 33F ,continue to be a cause of pneumococcal 
disease in both children and adults, across different geographic regions. These 7serot ypes 
are contained in PPSV23, a licensed vaccine in use for over 30 years, indica ting that despi[INVESTIGATOR_639253] y and use of PPSV23, the significant disease burden

Page 9[COMPANY_007] is developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a new complementary 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine 
(c7vPnC) candidate to augment current pneumococcal coverage in children and adults. c7vPnC contains pneumococcal conjugates of 7 different serotypes (8, 10A, 11A, 12F, 15B, 22F, and 33F) to protect against pneumococcal disease caused by [CONTACT_639273].  c7vPnC contains the same conjugate carrier protein and excipi[INVESTIGATOR_639254] 13.
The purpose of this Phase 1/2 study is to provide safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity 
data for c7vPnC in adults 50 through 85 years of age and will support further clinical development.
Study Design
This is a 2-stage, Phase 1/2, randomized, active-controlled, observer-blinded study with a 
2-arm parallel design. It is planned to be conducted at investigator sites in the [LOCATION_002].  The purpose of Stage [ADDRESS_855148]-in-human (FIH) safety and immunogenicity data with the investigational pneumococcal vaccine c7vPnC in adults 50 to 64 years of age, and it serves as the Phase 1 part of the study.  Stage 2 functions as the Phase 2 part of the study and will provide additional safety and immunogenicity data with c7vPnC in adults 65 to 85 years of age, compared to PPSV23.
Stage 1:
In Stage 1 of the study, approximately 66 adults 50 through 64 years of age with no history 
of pneumococcal vaccination will be randomized equally to receive a dose of c7vPnC or licensed tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis vaccine (Tdap) as the control vaccine.  
  
  Subjects will have blood drawn for safety 
laboratory testing and immunogenicity assessments at protocol-specified time points.  Prompted local reactions and systemic events occurring within 14 days after vaccination will be collected each day in an electronic diary (e-diary). Safety will be assessed through 6 months after vaccination.
 
 
Stage 2:
In Stage 2 of the study, approximately 440 adults 65 through 85 years of age previously 
vaccinated with Prevnar 13 ≥[ADDRESS_855149] administration, as part 
of their routine medical care, will be randomized equally to receive a dose of c7vPnC or CCICCI

Page 161. INTRODUCTION
1.1.Indication
Complementary 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (c7vPnC) is being developed for:
Active immunization to prevent invasive disease and pneumonia caused by  [CONTACT_639276].
1.2. B ackground and Rationale
1.2.1. Disease and Disease Burden
S pneumoniae are gram -positive encapsulated cocci that have been a leading cause of 
meningitis, bacteremia, pneumonia, and acute otitis media (AOM) and continue to be a major 
global public health concern.1,2,3Serious pneumococcal disease may  occur at any  age;
however, children <5 years and adults  [ADDRESS_855162] common pathogens identified in community -acquired 
pneumonia (CAP) requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_61342] U nited States in both children and adults .5,6  
Although invasive pneumococcal disease (I PD) is less common than pneumococcal 
pneumonia, particularly  with the introduction of the efficacious pneumococcal conjugate 
vaccines described below, there remains a burden of disease in all age groups and associated 
morbidity  and mortality .7  Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (C DC) 
estimated that in 2015 there were 29,5
00 cases and 3350 deaths due to IPD in persons of all 
ages in the U nited States.8In man y regions of the world the disease burden is much higher, 
reflected in an assessment by  [CONTACT_38375] (WHO) i n 2008 estimating that 
1.6 million people die from pneumococcal disease each year.9  Thesedata show that 
Spneumoniae remains an important cause of serious disease in the U nited States and 
worldwide.
The S pneumoniae polysaccharide capsule has been identi fied as an important virulence 
factor for this pathogen. While there are more than 95 pneumococcal seroty pes differentiated 
by [CONTACT_639272], a subset is more commonly  associated with 
severe disease.10,11Pneumococcal disease ca n be prevented with poly saccharide -based 
vaccines that induce antibody responses with functional (opsonophagocy tic) activity
 and 
target the capsular serotypes responsible for disease.
1.2.2. Vaccines to Prevent Pneumococcal Disease
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pneumococcal Polysaccharide Vac cines
Vaccines containing unconjugated polysaccharides have been licensed since the 1970s.  One 
such vaccine, the 23 -valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23) ,has been 
licensed in the U nited States since 1983.12,13PPSV23 contains unconjugated capsular 
polysaccharides for 23 seroty pes (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6B, 7F, 8, 9N, 9V, 10A, 11A, 12F, 14, 15B, 
17F, 18C, 19F, 19A, 20, 22F, 23F, and 33F).  PPSV23 elicits a T -cell–independent immune 
response.  PPSV23 induces only  limited responses to many  important pneumococcal 
seroty pes in children less than 2 y ears of age and does not induce a memory  response in any

limitations.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pneumococcal Polysaccharide Conjugate Vaccines
Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines contain poly saccharides that are covalently  linked 
(conjugated) to an immunogenic protein.  This modification results in T -cell
–dependent 
immune responses ,
which have been shown to be protective in y oung children, older adults, 
and populations with high -risk conditions.14,21  Prevnar(7-valent pneumococcal conjugate 
vaccine [7vPnC ]) was the first pneumococcal conjugate vaccine to be licensed (2000) and 
was indicated for the prevention of pneumococcal disease in infants and y oung children on 
the basis of efficacy  studies.  Prevnar contained capsular poly saccharide conjugates for 
7pneumococcal serot ypes ( 4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F, and 23F) ,each covalently  linked to the 
cross -reactive material 197 (CRM 197), a nontoxic variant of diphtheria toxin. Prevnar 
demonstrated efficacy  against vaccine -type (VT) IPD, pneumonia, and AOM in large 
randomized controlled efficacy /effectiveness studies in infants.22,23,[ADDRESS_855164] clinically /radiographically  defined pneumonia.25,26,[ADDRESS_855165] effects, with a 92% reduction of 7vPnC VT I PDin older adults  65 years of 
age.29,30
At the time of introduction, Prevnar covered the majority
 of serot ypes responsible for I PD in 
US infants ;however, additional seroty pes not included in Prevnar accounted for a significant 
proportion of AOM in that population, as well as IPD in older adults in the [LOCATION_002] and 
children outside of the U nited States.  Therefore, Prevnar 13 was developed to expand 
seroty pe coverage a nd was licensed in the U nited States in 2010.  Prevnar 13 includes the 
same S pneumoniae seroty pes as Prevnar and an additional 6 poly saccharide conjugates for 
seroty pes (1, 3, 5, 6A, 7F, and 19A).21,31  The addition of the 6 s erotypes expanded the 
percentage of vaccine -preventable IPD cases to 90% in most regions of the world.21,[ADDRESS_855166] VT I PD in the vaccinated population as well as decreases in 
colonization in both children and adults .38

Page [IP_ADDRESS]. Rationale for c7vPnC
The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of c7vPnC in healthy adults 
50 through 85 years of age.  This study represents the initial evaluation of c7vPnC in humans.  In addition to safety, immunogenicity of c7vPnC will also be described. In Stage 1, the inclusion of a control group receiving tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis vaccine (Tdap) will serve as a benchmark for the rates of local reactions that may be observed with a vaccine that contains CRM
197and has been evaluated and is licensed and recommended for 
use in this age group. In Stage 2, the inclusion of a control group receiving PPSV23 will serve as a benchmark for safety and the rates of local reactions that may be observed with a licensed and recommended pneumococcal vaccine containing the serotypes that are in common with c7vPnC.
Additional information for c7vPnC may be found in the single reference safety document 
(SRSD), which for this study is the c7vPnC IB .  The SRSDs for the Tdap and PPSV23 
control vaccines are the US package inserts (USPIs).

Page 203. STUDY DESIGN
This is a 2-stage, Phase 1/2, randomized, active-controlled, observer-blinded study with a 
2-arm parallel design. It is planned to be conducted at investigator sites in the [LOCATION_002].The purpose of Stage [ADDRESS_855167]-in-human (FIH) safety and immunogenicity data with the investigational pneumococcal vaccine c7vPnC in healthy adults 50 to 64 years of age, and it serves as the Phase 1 part of the study.  Stage 2 functions as the Phase 2 part of the study and will provide additional safety and immunogenicity data with c7vPnC in healthy adults 65 to 85 years of age, compared to PPSV23.
Stage 1:
In Stage 1 of the study, approximately 66 h ealthy adults 50 through 64 ye ars of age with no 
history of pneumococcal vaccination will be enrolled, screened, and randomized equally in a 1:1 ratio to receive a dose of c7vPnC or Tdap as the control vaccine.  The rate of vaccination 
in Stage 1 will be limited to ≤[ADDRESS_855168] blood drawn for baseline safety laboratory testing (hematology and tests for liver and renal function) at the screening visit (14 to 2 days prior to vaccination).  On Day 1 (Visit 1), subjects will have blood drawn for immunogenicity assessments, receive investigational product, be observed for 30 minutes after vaccination, and receive safety follow-up and electronic diary (e-diary) instructions.  Prompted local reactions (redness, swelling, and pain at the injection site) and systemic events (fever, headache, fatigue, muscle pain, and joint pain) occurring within 14 days aftervaccination will be collected each day in the e-diary.  Approximately 1 month after vaccination (Visit 2), subjects will return to the study site for safety follow-up (ie, collection of AEs [including nonserious AEs, SAEs, and NDCMCs]) and a blood draw (safety laboratory testing [hematology and tests for liver and renal function] and immunogenicity).  A telephone contact [CONTACT_67582] 6 months after vaccination (Visit 3) to collect any SAEs or NDCMCs that occurred since the 1-month follow-up visit.

4.4.1. Contraception
All male subjects who are able to father children and all female subjects who are of 
childbearing potential and who are, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], sexually active and at risk for pregnancy with their partner(s) must agree to use a highly effective method of contraception consistently and correctly for at least [ADDRESS_855189] of contraception methods (see below) and will confirm that the subject has been instructed in its consistent and correct use.  At time points indicated in the Schedule of Activities , the investigator or designee will 
inform the subject of the need to use highly effective contraception consistently and correctly and document the conversation and the subject’s affirmation in the subject’s chart (subjectsneeds to affirm their consistent and correct use of at least 1 of the selected methods of contraception).  In addition, the investigator or designee will instruct the subject to call immediately if the selected contraception method is discontinued or if pregnancy is known or suspected in the subject or the partner.
Highly effective methods of contraception are those that, alone or in combination, result in a 
failure rate of less than 1% per year when used consistently and correctly (ie, perfect use) and include the following:
1. Established use of hormonal methods of contraception associated with inhibition of 
ovulation (eg, oral, inserted, injected, implanted, transdermal) provided the subject or male subject’s female partner plans to remain on the same treatment throughout the entire CCI

Investigational product administration details will be recorded on the CRF.
5.8. Investigational Product Storage
The investigator or an approved representative (eg, pharmacist, unblinded administrator) will 
ensure that all investigational products are stored in a secured area with controlled access under required storage conditions and in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements.
Investigational products should be stored in their original containers and in accordance with 
the labels.
c7vPnC, Tdap, and PPSV23 will be shipped to the study site after required regulatory and 
legal documents have been received by [CONTACT_456].
 
Any storage conditions stated in the SRSD (c7vPnC IB, Tdap USPI, and PPSV23 USPI) will
be superseded by [CONTACT_580051].
Site systems must be capable of measuring and documenting (for example, via a log), at a 
minimum, daily minimum and maximum temperatures for all site storage locations (as applicable, including frozen, refrigerated, and/or room-temperature products).  This should be captured from the time of investigational product receipt throughout the study.  Even for continuous-monitoring systems, a log or site procedure that ensures active evaluation for excursions should be available.  The intent is to ensure that the minimum and maximum temperature is checked each business day to confirm that no excursion occurred since the last evaluation and to provide the site with the capability to store or view the minimum/maximum temperature for all nonworking days upon return to normal operations.  The operation of the temperature-monitoring device and storage unit (for example, refrigerator), as applicable, should be regularly inspected to ensure they are maintained in working order.
Any excursions from the product label storage conditions should be reported to [COMPANY_007] upon 
discovery. The site should actively pursue options for returning the product to the storage conditions described in the labeling, as soon as possible.  Deviations from the storage requirements, including any actions taken, must be documented and reported to [COMPANY_007].
Once an excursion is identified, the investigational product must be quarantined and not used 
until [COMPANY_007] provides permission to use the investigational product.  It will not be considered a protocol deviation if [COMPANY_007] approves the use of the investigational product after the temperature excursion. Use of the investigational product prior to [COMPANY_007] approval will be 
considered a protocol deviation. Specific details regarding information the site should report 
for each excursion will be provided to the site.CCI

Final Protocol, [ADDRESS_855206] Withdrawal
An inve stigator and/or sponsor can withdraw a subject from the study  if deemed appropriate.  
In addition, if a subject fails to continue to meet the inclusion criteria, new information 
becomes available that would exclude the subject , or the subject develops a co ndition or 
situation that would meet exclusion criteria ,the subject may  be considered for withdrawal.
Reasons wh y a subject may discontinue or be withdrawn from the study include, but are not 
limited to ,failure to meet entrance criteria (screening failur e), AE, death, pregnancy , 
protocol deviation , lost to follow -up, no longer willing to participate in the study , study  
terminated b y the sponsor, or an y other reason.  Subjects who have received the 
investigational product will not be replaced ,regardless of the reason for withdrawal.
The investigator should capture the reason for withdrawal in the database for all subjects and 
a 6-month postvaccination follow -up telephone contact [CONTACT_639291] y 
information should be completed for all subjects who have been withdrawn after 
administration of investigational product.
6.4.1. Withdrawal of Consent
Subjects who request to discontinue after receipt of investigational product will remain in the 
study  and must continue to be followed for protocol -specified fol low-up procedures.  The 
only exception to this is when a subject specifically  withdraws consent for any  further 
contact [CONTACT_639292]. Subjects should notify  the investigator in writing of the decision to withdraw 
consent from future follow -up, whenever possible.  The withdrawal of consent should be 
explained in detail in the medical records b y the investigator and entered on the appropriate 
CRF page.  I n the event that vital sta tus (whether the subject is alive or dead) is being 
measured, publicl y available information should be used to determine vital status only  as 
appropriatel y directed in accordance with local law.
6.4.2. Lost to Follow -up
All reasonable efforts must be made to loca te subjects to determine and report their ongoing
status. This includes follow
-up with persons authorized by  [CONTACT_74084]. Lost
to follow -up is defined by  [CONTACT_53981] y to reach the subject after a minimum of [ADDRESS_855207]’s medical records. If it is 
determined that the subject has died, the site will use locally  permissible methods to obtain
the date and cause of death. If the investigator’s use of a third -party representative to assist 
in the follow -up portion of the study  has been included in the subject’s informed consent, 
then the investigator may use a sponsor- retained third -party repre sentative to assist site staff 
with obtaining the subject’s contact [CONTACT_310800] -up portion of the study . The site staff and representative will consult

Final Protocol, [ADDRESS_855208]’s medical records.
Subjects may withdraw from the study  at any  time at their own request, or they  may  be 
withdrawn at an y time at the discretion of the investigator or sponsor for safety (see also 
Withdrawal From the Study  Due to Adverse Events ,Section 8.1.3) or behavioral reasons, or 
the inability  of the subject to comply  with the protocol -required schedule of study  visits or 
procedures at a given study  site.
If a subject does not r eturn for a scheduled visit, every  effort should be made to contact [CONTACT_1560].  All attempts to contact [CONTACT_8873]’s medical record.  In an y circumstance, every  effort 
should be made to document subject outcome, if possible.  The investigator should inquire 
about the reason for withdrawal, request that the subject return for a final visit, if applicable, 
and follow up with the subject regarding an y unresolved AEs.
If the s ubject withdraws from the study , and also withdraws consent for disclosure of future 
information, no further evaluations should be performed, and no additional data should be 
collected.  The sponsor may  retain and continue to use any  data collected bef ore such 
withdrawal of consent.
7.ASSESSMENTS
Every  effort should be made to ensure that the protocol -
required tests and procedures are 
completed as described. However ,it is anticipated that from time to time there may  be 
circumstances outside of the control o f the investigator that may  make it unfeasible to 
perform the test. In these cases the investigator will take all steps necessar y to ensure the 
safet y and well -being of the subject. When a protocol -required test cannot be performed ,the 
investigator will document the reason for this and any corrective and preventive actions that 
heor she has taken to ensure that normal processes are adhered to as soon as possible. The 
study  team will be informed of these incidents in a timely  manner .

[IP_ADDRESS]. Fever
In order to record informa tion on fever, a digital thermometer will be given to the subject 
with instructions on how to measure oral temperature at home.  Temperature will be 
collected in the evening daily  for 14 day s following vaccination (Day s 1 to 14, where Day  1 
is the day  of vaccination) and at an y time during the 14 day s that fever is suspected.  Fever is 
defined as an oral temperature of 100.4F (38.0C).  The highest temperature for each day  
will be recorded in the e -diary .  In the event of a fever on Day  14, temperature w ill be 
collected dail y until fever has resolved (1 day of temperature <100.4
F [<38.0C]) in order to 
collect a stop date in the CRF.  A subject with a fever >104.0 F (>40.0

7.3. Immunogenicity
Blood samples (approximately 50 mL/visit) for immunogenicity assessments will be 
collected from all subjects prior to vaccination (Visit 1/Day 1), at Visit [ADDRESS_855221] will be approximately 120 mL
(Stage 1 subjects) or 150 mL (Stage 2 subjects) (~50 mL/visit).  Sera will be used for immunogenicity assessments and assay development purposes.
OPA titers for the 7 pneumococcal serotypes (8, 10A, 11A, 12F, 15B, 22F, and 33F) will be 
determined in all subjects for each blood sample.  Results will be reported as OPA titers.
 
Immunogenicity assays will be performed at [COMPANY_007] Vaccine Research & Development 
Laboratory located at [ADDRESS_855222], Pearl River, NY [ZIP_CODE] and/or at a facility designated by [CONTACT_4618].
7.4. Laboratory Tests:  Stage 1 Only
The safety laboratory tests will be performed at times defined in the Schedule of Activities
and Section 6 of the protocol.
The FDA toxicity grading scale
61for healthy adult and adolescent volunteers enrolled in 
preventive vaccine clinical trials will be used to grade abnormalities.
If abnormal laboratory parameters are reported at screening and the investigator 
believes the results to be erroneous or to represent stable Grade 1 abnormalities, the abnormal laboratory parameters may be retested. Subjects with stable Grade 1 abnormalities may be considered eligible at the discretion of the investigator.  A “stable” Grade 1 laboratory abnormality is defined as a report of Grade 1 on an initial blood sample that 
remains ≤Grade [ADDRESS_855223].CCI

Samples that remain after performing assay s outlined in the protocol may  be stored by  [CONTACT_4618]. 
Unless a time limitation is required b y local regulations or ethical requirements, the samples 
will be stored for up to 15 y ears after the end of the study  and then destroy ed.  If allowed b y 
the informed consent document, stored samples may  be used for additional testing to better 
understand the immune responses to the vaccine(s) under stud y in this protocol, to inform the 
development of other products, and/or for vaccine- related assay  work supporting vaccine 
programs.  No testing of the subject’s genetic material will be performed.
The subject may request that his or her samples, if still identifiable, be destroy ed at a ny time; 
however, an y data already collected from those samples will still be used for this research. 
The biological samples may be shared with other researchers as long as confidentiality  is

8.ADVERSE EVENT REPORT ING
8.1.Requirements
The table below summarizes the requirements for recording safet y events on the CRF and for 
reporting safety  events on the Clinical Trial (CT) SAE Report Form to [COMPANY_007] Safet y.  These 
requirements are delineat ed for 3 t ypes of events: (1) SAEs; (2) nonserious AEs; and (3) 
exposure to the investigational product under study  during pregnancy  or breastfeedi ng, and 
occupational exposure.
Safety Event Recorded on the CRF Reported on the CT SAE Report 
Form  to [COMPANY_007] Safety Within [ADDRESS_855224] under study during 
pregnancy or breastfeeding, and 
occupational exposureAll (regardless of whether 
associated with an AE), except 
occupational exposureExposure during pregnancy, 
exposure via breastfeeding, 
occupational exposure (regardless 
of whether associated with an AE)
a.Nonserious AEs will be recorded from the time the subject provides informed consent through and 
including Visit 2.  After Visit 2, only NDCMC s (can be nonserious) and SAEs will be reported.

PF-06842433 ( Complementary 7-valent Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine)
C3571001
Final Protocol, [ADDRESS_855225](s) will be reported as described in the following 
paragraphs.
Events listed in the table above that require reporting to [COMPANY_007] Safety  on the CT SAE Report 
Form within [ADDRESS_855226] be made immediately , irrespective of the extent of available 
event information.  This time frame also applies to additional new (follow -up) information on 
previously  forwarded reports.  I n the rare situation that the investigator does not become 
immediately  aware of the occurrence of an event, the inve stigator must report the event 
within 24 hours after learning of it and document the time of his/her first awareness of the 
event.
For each event, the investigator must pursue and obtain adequate information both to 
determine the outcome and to assess whet her it meets the criteria for classification as an SAE 
(see the Serious Adverse Events section below).  In addition, the investigator may be 
requested b y [COMPANY_007] Safety to obtain specific follow -up information in an expedited fashion.  
This information is m ore detailed than that recorded on the CRF .  In general, this will include 
a description of the event in sufficient detail to allow for a complete medical assessment of 
the case and independent determination of possible causalit y.  An y information relevant to 
the event, such as concomitant medications and illnesses, must be provided.  I n the case of a 
subject death, a summary of available autopsy  findings must be submitted as soon as possible 
to [COMPANY_007] Safety .  An y pertinent additional information must be r eported on the CT SAE 
Report Form; additional source documents (eg, medical records, CRF, laboratory  data) are to 
be sent to [COMPANY_007] Safet y ONLY upon request.
As part of ongoing safet y reviews conducted b y the sponsor, an y nonserious AE that is 
determined b y the sponsor to be serious will be reported by [CONTACT_74094].  To assist 
in the determination of case seriousness, further information may  be requested from the 
investigator to provide clarity  and understanding of the event in the context of the c linical 
study .
For Stage [ADDRESS_855227] the [COMPANY_007] study  physician directly as soon 
as possible after becoming aware of a nonprompted severe AE or SAE occurring within 
14days after vaccination.  Additional information regarding such events and the reporting 
requirements can be found in the SRM or equivalent.
8.1.1. Additional Details on Recording Adverse Events on the CRF
All events detailed in the table above will be recorded on the AE page(s) of the CRF.  I t 
should be noted that the CT SAE Report Form for reporting of SAE information is not the 
same as the AE page of the CRF.  When the same data are collected, the forms must be 
completed in a consistent manner.  AEs should be recorded using concise medical 
terminology  and the same AE t erm should be used on both the CRF and the CT SAE Report 
Form for reporting of SAE information.

PF-06842433 ( Complementary 7-valent Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine)
C3571001
Final Protocol, [ADDRESS_855228] will be questioned about the 
occurrence of AEs in a nonleading manner.
8.1.3. Withdrawal From the Study Due to Adverse Events (see also the Subject 
Withdrawal Section)
Withdrawal due to AEs should be distinguished from withdrawal due to other causes, 
according to the definition of AE noted b elow, and recorded on the CRF.
When a subject withdraws from the study  because of an SAE, the SAE must be recorded on 
the CRF and reported, as appropriate, on the CT SAE Report Form, in accordan ce with the 
Requirements section above.
8.1.4. Time Period for Collecting AE/SAE Information
The time period for actively eliciting and collecting AEs, SAEs , and NDCMCs (“active 
collection period”) for each subject begins from the time the subject provides inform ed 
consent, which is obtained before the subject’s participation in the study  (ie, before 
undergoing an y stud y-related procedure and/or receiving investigational product), through 
and including Visit 2 .  
Between Visit 2 and Visit 3 (Stage 1) and Visit 2 an dVisit 4 
(Stage 2), only NDCMCs and SAEs will be reported.  An NDCMC is defined as a disease or 
medical condition, not previously  identified, that is expected to be persistent or is otherwise 
long-lasting in its effects.
For subjects who are screen failur es, the active collection period ends when screen failure 
status is determined.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Reporting SAEs to [COMPANY_007] Safety
All SAEs occurring in a subject during the active collection period are reported to [COMPANY_007] 
Safety  on the CT SAE Report Form.
SAEs occurring in a subject after the active collection period has ended are reported to [COMPANY_007] 
Safety  if the investigator becomes aware of them; at a minimum, all SAEs that the 
investigator believes have at least a reasonable possibility  of being related to investigational 
product must be reported to [COMPANY_007] Safety .
Follow -up by  [CONTACT_74095] a level acceptable to the investigator, and 
[COMPANY_007] concurs with that assessment.
[IP_ADDRESS].
Recording Nonserious AEs and SAEs on the CRF
During the active collection period, both nonserious AEs and SAEs are recorded on the CRF.
Follow -up by  [CONTACT_47610] a level acceptable to the investigator, and [COMPANY_007] concurs with that assessment.

Final Protocol, 28 June 2017
Page 538.1.5. Causality Assessment
The investigator’s assessment of causalit y must be provided for all AEs (serious and 
nonserious); the investigator must record the causal relationship on the CRF, and report such 
an assessment in accordance with the SAE reporting requirements, if applicable.  An 
investigator’s causalit y assessment is the determination of whether there exists a reasonable 
possibility  that the investigational product caused o r contributed to an AE; generall y the facts 
(evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship should be provided.  If the 
investigator does not know whether or not the investigational product caused the event, then 
the event will be handled as “related to investigational product” for reporting purposes, as 
defined b y the sponsor.  If the investigator's causality assessment is “unknown but not 
related” to investigational product, this should be clearl y documented on study  records.
In addition, if the investigator determines that an SAE is associated with study procedures, 
the investigator must record this causal relationship in the source documents and CRF, and 
report such an assessment in the dedicated section of the CT SAE Report Form and in 
accordance with the SAE reporting requirements.
8.1.6. Sponsor’s Reporting Requirements to Regulatory Authorities
AE reporting, including suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions, will be carried out 
in accordance with applicable local regulations.
8.2.Definitions
8.2.1. Adve rse Events
An AE is an y untoward medical occurrence in a study subject administered a product or 
medical device; the event need not necessaril y have a causal relationship with the treatment 
or usage.  Examples of AEs include, but are not limited to: 
Abnor mal test findings;
Clinically  significant signs and sy mptoms;
Changes in physical examination findings;
Hypersensitivity ;
Progression/worsening of underl ying disease ;
Drug abuse;
Drug dependency .
Additionally , AEs may  include signs and s ymptoms resulting f rom:
Drug overdose;

PF-06842433 ( Complementary 7-valent Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine)
C3571001
Final Protocol, 28 June 2017
Page 54Drug withdrawal;
Drug misuse; 
Drug interactions;
Extravasation;
Exposure during pregnancy  (EDP);
Exposure via breastfeeding;
Medication error;
Occupational exposure.
8.2.2. Abnormal Test Findings
Abnormal objective test findings should be recorded as AEs when an y of the following 
conditions are met: 
Test result is associated with accompan ying symptoms; and/or
Test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention; and/or
Test result leads to a change in study  dosi ng (outside of any  protocol -specified dose 
adjustments) or discontinuation from the study , significant additional concomitant drug 
treatment, or other therapy; and/or
Test result is considered to be an AE b y the investigator or sponsor.
Merel y repeating an abnormal test, in the absence of any  of the above conditions, does not 
constitute an AE.  An y abnormal test result that is determined to be an error does not require 
recording as an AE.
8.2.3. Serious Adverse Events
An SAE is any  untoward medical occurrence at a ny dose that:
Results in death;
Is life -threatening (immediate risk of death);
Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081];
Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity  (substantial disruption of the 
ability to conduct normal life functions);

PF-06842433 ( Complementary 7-valent Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine)
C3571001
Final Protocol, 28 June 2017
Page 55Results in congenital anomaly /birth defect.
Or that is considered to be:
An important medical event.
Medical and scientific judgment is exercised in determining whether an event is an important 
medical event.  An importa nt medical event may  not be immediately  life-threatening and/or 
result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  However, if it is determined that the event may  jeopardize 
the subject or may  require intervention to prevent one of the other AE outcomes, the 
important m edical event should be reported as serious.
Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency  room or at home for 
allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; 
or development of drug dependency  or drug abuse.
Medical device complaints may  meet the SAE reporting requirement criteria (see the Medical 
Device Complaint Reporting Requirements section).  An incident is an y malfunction (ie, the 
failure of a device to meet its performance specifications or to perform as intended; 
performance specifications include all claims made in the labeling for the device) that, 
directly  or indirectl y, might lead to or might have led to the death of a subject, or user, or of 
other persons, or to a serious deteriorati on in th eir state of health.
A serious injury  that can cause a serious deterioration in state of health can include:
Alife-threatening illness, even if temporary  in nature;
Apermanent impairment of a body function or permanent damage to a body structure;
A condition necessitating medical or surgical intervention to prevent the above 2 bulleted 
items;
oExamples: clinically  relevant increase in the duration of a surgical procedure; a 
condition that requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_639262];
Any indirect harm as a consequence of an incorrect diagnostic or in vitro diagnostic 
device test results when used within the manufacturer’s instructions for use;
Fetal distress
, fetal death, or an y congenital abnormality  or birth de fects.
8.2.4. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4589] (even less than 24 hours) in a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_31009] , or any  prolongation of an existing admission.  Admission also 
includes transfer within the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4591]/intensive care unit (eg, from the psy chiatric 
wing to a medical floor, medical floor to a coronary  care unit, or neurological floor to a 

PF-06842433 ( Complementary 7-valent Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine)

Final Protocol, 28 June 2017
Page 56tuberculosis unit).  An emergency  room visit does not necessarily constitute a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; 
however, the event leading to the emergency  room visit is assessed for medical importance.
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4592]:
Rehabilitation facilities;
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4593];
Respi[INVESTIGATOR_4594] (eg, caregiver relief);
Skilled nursing facilities;
Nursing homes;
Same -day surgeries (as outpatient/same -day/ambulatory  procedures).
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4595] a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_74039].  Examples include:
Admission for treatment of a preexisting condition not associated with the development 
of a new AE or with a worsening of the preexisting condition (eg, for workup of a 
persistent pretreatment laboratory  abnormality );
Social admission (eg, subject has no place to sleep);
Administrative admission (eg, for yearly physical examination);
Protocol -specified admission during a study  (eg, for a procedure required by  [CONTACT_8896]);
Optional admission not associated with a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_4596] (eg, for elective 
cosmetic surgery );
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_639263] a medical AE;
Preplanned treatments or surgical procedures.  These should be noted in the baseline 
documentation for the entire protocol and/or for the individual subject .
Diagnostic and therapeutic noninvasive and invasive procedures, such as s urgery , should not 
be reported as SAEs.  However, the medical condition for which the procedure was 
performed should be reported if it meets the definition of an SAE.  For example, an acute 
appendicitis that begins during the reporting period should be rep orted if the SAE 
requirements are met, and the resulting appendectomy  should be recorded as treatment of the 
AE.

Final Protocol, 28 June 2017
Page 578.3.Severity Assessment
GRADE If required on the AE page of the CRF, the investigator w ill use the adjectives MILD, 
MODERATE, orSEVERE to describ e the maximum intensity of the AE. For purposes of 
consistency, these intensity grades are defined as follows:
[ADDRESS_855229]'s usual function.
[ADDRESS_855230]'s usual function.
[ADDRESS_855231]'s usual function.
Note the distinction between the severit y and the seriousness of an AE.  A severe event is not 
necessarily  an SAE.  For example, a headache may  be severe (interferes significantly  with 
the subject's usu al function) but would not be classified as serious unless it met one of the 
criteria for SAEs, listed above.
8.4.Special Situations
8.4.1. Protocol -Specified Serious Adverse Events
There are no protocol -specified SAEs in this study.  All SAEs will be reported to Pfi zer 
Safety  by [CONTACT_74096], and will be handled as SAEs in 
the safet y database.
8.4.2. Potential Cases of Drug- Induced Liver Injury
Humans exposed to a drug who show no sign of liver injury  (as determined by  [CONTACT_20023]) are termed “tolerators,” while those who show transient liver injury , but adapt 
are termed “adaptors.”  In some subjects, transaminase elevations are a harbinger of a more 
serious potential outcome.  These subjects fail to adapt and therefore a re "susceptible" to 
progressive and serious liver injury , commonly  referred to as drug- induced liver injury  
(DILI).  Subjects who experience a transaminase elevation above 3 times the upper limit of 
normal ( ×ULN) should be monitored more frequently  to det ermine if they are an “adaptor” 
or are “susceptible.”
Liver function tests (LFTs) are not required as a routine safet y monitoring procedure in 
Stage [ADDRESS_855232] presen ts with clinical signs/sy mptoms, such L FT results should be 
managed and followed as described below.
In the majority  of DILI cases, elevations in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT) precede total bilirubin (TBili) elevati ons (>2 ×ULN) by  [CONTACT_74097].  The increase in TBili ty pi[INVESTIGATOR_1306] y occurs while AST/ALT is/are still elevated 
above 3 ×ULN (ie, AST/AL T and TBili values will be elevated within the same lab oratory
sample).  In rare instances, by  [CONTACT_639297], AST/AL T values might 
have decreased.  This occurrence is still regarded as a potential DILI.  Therefore, abnormal 
elevations in either AST OR AL T in addition to TBili that meet the criteria outlined below 
are considered potential DILI (assessed per Hy ’s law criteria) cases and should alway s be 
considered important medical events, even before all other possible causes of liver injury 
have been excluded.

PF-06842433 ( Complementary 7-valent Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine)
C3571001
Final Protocol, [ADDRESS_855233]’s 
individual baseline values and underl ying conditions.  Subjects who present with the 
following laboratory  abnormalities should be evaluated further as potential DILI (Hy ’s law) 
cases to definitivel y determine the etiology of the abnormal laboratory values:
Subjects with AST/AL T and TBili baseline values within the normal range who 
subsequently  present with AST OR AL T values >3 ×ULN AND a TBili value >2 ×ULN 
with no evidence of hemoly sis and an alkaline phosphatase value <2 ×ULN or not 
available;
For subjects with baseline AST OR ALT ORTBili values above the ULN, the following 
threshold values are used in the definition mentioned above, as needed, depending on 
which values are above the ULN at baseline:
oPreexisting AST or ALT baseline values above the normal range: AST or ALT values 
>2times the baseline values AND >3 × ULN; or >8 × ULN (whichever is smaller).
oPreexisting values of TBili above the normal range: TBili level increased from 
baseline value b y an amount of at least 1 × ULN orif the val ue reaches >3 × ULN 
(whichever is smaller).
Rises in AST/AL T and TBili separated b y more than a few weeks should be assessed 
individually  based on clinical judgment; any  case where uncertainty  remains as to whether it 
represents a potential Hy’s law case s hould b
e reviewed with the sponsor.
The subject should return to the investigator site and be evaluated as soon as possible, 
preferabl y within [ADDRESS_855234] and AL T and TBili, laboratory  tests should 
include albumin, creatine kinase (CK), direct and indirect bilirubin, gamma -glutamyl 
transferase (GGT), prothrombin time (PT)/international normalized ratio (INR), total bile 
acids, alkaline phosphatase ,and acetaminophen drug and/or protein adduct levels.  
Consideration should also be given to drawing a separate tube of clotted blood and an 
anticoagulated tube of blood for further testing, a s needed, for further contemporaneous 
analyses at the time of the recognized initial abnormalities to determine etiology .  A detailed 
history , including relevant information, such as review of ethanol, acetaminophen (either b y 
itself or as a coformulated p roduct in prescription or over -the-counter medications) , 
recreational drug, supplement (herbal) use and consumption, family  history , sexual history , 
travel history , history  of contact [CONTACT_4490] a jaundiced person, surgery , blood transfusion, history  
of liver or allergic disease, and potential occupational exposure to chemicals, should be 
collected.  Further testing for acute hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E infection and liver imaging 
(eg, b iliary  tract) may  be warranted.
All cases demonstrated on repeat testing as m eeting the laboratory  criteria of AST/AL T and 
TBili elevation defined above should be considered potential DILI (Hy ’s law) cases if no 
other reason for the LFT abnormalities has yet been found.  Such potential DILI (Hy’s law) 

PF-06842433 ( Complementary 7-valent Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine)
C3571001
Final Protocol, 28 June 2017
Page 59cases are to be reported as SAEs, irrespective of availability of all the results of the 
investigations performed to determine etiology of the LFT abnormalities.
A potential DILI (Hy ’s law) case becomes a confirmed case onl y after all results of 
reasonable investigations have been rece ived and have excluded an alternative etiology .
8.4.3. Exposure to the Investigational Product During Pregnancy or Breastfeeding, and 
Occupational Exposure
Exposure to the investigational product under study  during pregnancy  or breastfeeding and 
occupational expo sure are reportable to [COMPANY_007] Safety  within 24 hours of investigator 
awareness.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Exposure During Pregnancy
For both unapproved/unlicensed products and for marketed products, an EDP occurs if:
A female becomes, or is found to be, pregnant either while receiv ing or having been 
exposed (eg, because of treatment or environmental exposure) to the investigational 
product; or the female becomes or is found to be pregnant after discontinuing and/or 
being exposed to the investigational product;
An example of environm ental exposure would be a case involving direct contact 
[CONTACT_4490] a [COMPANY_007] product in a pregnant woman (eg, a nurse reports that she is pregnant 
and has been exposed to chemotherapeutic products).
A male has been exposed (eg, because of treatment or environment al exposure) to the 
investigational product prior to or around the time of conception and/or is exposed during 
his partner’s pregnancy .
If a subject or subject’s partner becomes or is found to be pregnant during the subject’s 
treatment with the investigati onal product, the investigator must report this information to 
[COMPANY_007] Safety  on the CT SAE Report Form and an EDP supplemental form, regardless of 
whether an SAE has occurred.  In addition, the investigator must submit information 
regarding environmental e xposure to a [COMPANY_007] product in a pregnant woman (eg, a subject 
reports that she is pregnant and has been exposed to a cy totoxic product by [CONTACT_31061][INVESTIGATOR_4598]) to [COMPANY_007] Safety  using the EDP supplemental form.  This must be done irrespective 
of whether an AE has occurred and within 24 hours of awareness of the exposure.  The 
information submitted should include the anticipated date of delivery  (see below for 
information related to termination of pregnancy ).

Final Protocol, 28 June 2017
Page 60Follow -up is conducted to obtain general information on the pregnancy  and its outcome for 
all EDP reports with an unknown outcome.  The investigator will follow the pregnancy  until 
completion (or until pregnancy  termination) and notify  [COMPANY_007] Safet y of the outcome as a 
follow -up to the initial EDP supp lemental form.  In the case of a live birth, the structural 
integrity  of the neonate can be assessed at the time of birth.  In the event of a termination, the 
reason(s) for termination should be specified and, if clinically  possible, the structural 
integri ty of the terminated fetus should be assessed by  [CONTACT_4692] (unless 
preprocedure test findings are conclusive for a congenital anomal y and the findings are 
reported).
If the outcome of the pregnancy  meets the criteria for an SAE (ie, ectopic p regnancy , 
spontaneous abortion, intrauterine fetal demise, neonatal death, or congenital anomal y [in a 
live-born bab y, a terminated fetus, an intrauterine fetal demise, or a neonatal death]), the 
investigator should follow the procedures for reporting SAEs.
Additional information about pregnancy  outcomes that are reported to [COMPANY_007] Safet y as SAEs 
follows: 
Spontaneous abortion includes miscarriage and missed abortion;
Neonatal deaths that occur within [ADDRESS_855235].
Additional information regarding the EDP may  be requested by  [CONTACT_456].  Further 
follow -up of birth outcomes will be handled on a case- by-case basis (eg, follow -
up on 
preterm infants to identify developmental delay s).  In the case of paternal exposure, the 
investigator will provide the subject with the Pregnant Partner Release of Information Form 
to deliver to his partner.  The investigator must document in the source documents that the 
subject was given the Pregnant Partner Release of Information Form to provide to his 
partner.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Exposure During Brea stfeeding
Scenarios of exposure during breastfeeding must be reported, irrespective of the presence of 
an associated SAE, to [COMPANY_007] Safet y within 24 hours of the investigator’s awareness, using the 
CT SAE Report Form.  An exposure during breastfeeding repo rt is not created when a [COMPANY_007] 
drug specifically  approved for use in breastfeeding women (eg, vitamins) is administered in 
accord with authorized use.  However, if the infant experiences an SAE associated with such 
a drug’s administration, the SAE is repo rted together with the exposure during breastfeeding.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Occupational Exposure
An occupational exposure occurs when, during the performance of job duties, a person 
(whether a healthcare professional or otherwise) gets in unplanned direct contact [CONTACT_8898], which may  or may  not lead to the occurrence of an AE.

Descriptive statistics will be compi[INVESTIGATOR_639265], separately. In each of Stage 1 and Stage 2 groups, local reactions and systemic events from Day 1 to Day 14 after study vaccination will be presented by [CONTACT_122706].  Descriptive statistics will include proportions of subjects with the indicated endpoint and the associated Clopper-Pearson 95% CIs.
AEs (including nonserious AEs, SAEs, and NDCMCs) with causality and severity will be 
summarized from vaccination until Visit 2, approximately 1 month (28-35 days) after vaccination for Stage 1 and Stage 2. Additionally, SAEs and NDCMCs will be presented from vaccination until approximately 6 months after vaccination (both Stage 1 and Stage 2) and 12 months after vaccination (Stage 2 only).  The descriptive statistics for AEs will be summarized as the number and percentage of subjects reporting at least 1 event of each preferred term with the associated Clopper-Pearson 95% CIs, arranged by [CONTACT_9313], and will also be summarized as the number of occurrences of the event.CCI

9.5. Analysis Timing
During this multistage study, the following analyses will occur:
Stage 1
1. Unblinded descriptive analyses of Stage 1 safety data through the 1-month 
postvaccination visit to permit start of Stage 2.
2. Unblinded immunogenicity data from the 1-month postvaccination visit from Stage 1 will 
be analyzed when it is available.  Analyses will be descriptive.
3. Unblinded descriptive analyses of the 6-month postvaccination safety data will be
conducted when data are available.
Stage 2
1. Unblinded descriptive analyses for the 1-month postvaccination time point for Stage 2 
will be conducted when the safety and immunogenicity data are available. This analysis will inform internal program development decisions and provide safety and immunogenicity data to support end–of–Phase 2 regulatory interactions for development of an adult indication.
2. Unblinded descriptive analyses of the 6-month and 12-month postvaccination safety data 
will be conducted when data are available.
 
There will be no alpha adjustments for these analyses.
Investigator sites and laboratory personnel directly conducting the immunogenicity assays 
will remain blinded until the study database has been locked and unblinded.

the protocol and GCPs are being followed.  The monitors may review source documents to confirm that the data recorded on CRFs are accurate.  The investigator and institution will allow [COMPANY_007] monitors/auditors or its agents and appropriate regulatory authorities direct access to source documents to perform this verification.  This verification may also occur after study completion.
During study conduct and/or after study completion, the investigator site may be subject to 
review by [CONTACT_1201]/EC, and/or to quality assurance audits performed by [CONTACT_4618], or companies working with or on behalf of [COMPANY_007], and/or to inspection by [CONTACT_4708].
The investigator(s) will notify [COMPANY_007] or its agents immediately of any regulatory inspection 
notification in relation to the study. Furthermore, the investigator will cooperate with [COMPANY_007] or its agents to prepare the investigator site for the inspection and will allow [COMPANY_007] or its agent, whenever feasible, to be present during the inspection.  The investigator site and investigator will promptly resolve any discrepancies that are identified between the study data and the subject's medical records.  The investigator will promptly provide copi[INVESTIGATOR_4599].  Before response submission to the regulatory authorities, the investigator will provide [COMPANY_007] or its agents with an opportunity to review and comment on responses to any such findings.
It is important that the investigator(s) and their relevant personnel are available during the 
monitoring visits and possible audits or inspections and that sufficient time is devoted to the process.
11. DATA HANDLING AND RECORD KEEPI[INVESTIGATOR_1645]
11.1. Case Report Forms/Electronic Data Record
As used in this protocol, the term CRF should be understood to refer to either a paper form or 
an electronic data record or both, depending on the data collection method used in this study.
A CRF is required and should be completed for each included subject.  The completed 
original CRFs are the sole property of [COMPANY_007] and should not be made available in any form to third parties, except for authorized representatives of [COMPANY_007] or appropriate regulatory authorities, without written permission from [COMPANY_007].CCI
PF-06842433 ( Complementary 7-valent Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine)
C3571001
Final Protocol, 28 June 2017
Page 67The investigator has ultimate responsibility  for the collection and reporting of all clinical, 
safet y,and laboratory  data entered on the CRFs and any  other data collection forms (source 
documents) and ensuring th at they  are accurate, authentic /original, attributable, complete, 
consistent, legible, timely  (contemporaneous), enduring ,
and available when required.  The 
CRFs must be signed by  [CONTACT_639301]. Any correcti ons to entries made in the CRFs or source 
documents must be dated, initialed ,and explained (if necessary ) and should not obscure the 
original entry .
In most cases, the source documents are the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_153833].  In these 
cases ,data collected on the CRFs must match the data in those charts.
In some cases, the CRF may  also serve as the source document.  In these cases, a document 
should be available at the investigator site and at [COMPANY_007] that clea rly identifies those data that 
will be recorded on the CRF, and for which the CRF will stand as the source document.
11.2. Record Retention
To enable evaluations and/or inspections/ audits from regulatory  authorities or [COMPANY_007], the 
investigator agrees to keep rec ords, including the identity  of all participating subjects 
(sufficient information to link records, eg,CRFs and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097]), all original signed 
informed consent documents, copi[INVESTIGATOR_4600], safet y reporting forms, source documents, 
and detailed r ecords of treatment disposition, and adequate documentation of relevant 
correspondence ( eg,letters, meeting minutes, and telephone call reports).  The records should 
be retained b y the investigator according to the ICH guidelines
, according to local 
regul ations, or as specified in the c linical study agreement (CSA) , whichever is longer.
If the investigator becomes unable for an y reason to continue to retain study records for the 
required period ( eg, retirement, relocation), [COMPANY_007] should be prospectivel y notified.  The 
study  records must be transferred to a designee acceptable to [COMPANY_007] , such as another 
investigator, another institution, or an independent third party  arranged by  [CONTACT_4618].
Investigator records must be kept for a minimum of [ADDRESS_855243] obtain [COMPANY_007]'s written permission before disposing of an y records,

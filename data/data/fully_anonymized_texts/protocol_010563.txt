Significance  
The Center for Disease Control (CDC) released guidelines  in [ADDRESS_679540] -discharge narcotic use after laparoscopic hysterectomy, for which there is an absence of published data. Data 
on narcotic use after hysterectomy may become a basis for future recommendations on appropriate narcotic prescribing following hysterectomy. Demonstrating a clinically significant narcotic use reduction or pain reduction  with abdominal ice 
pack therapy would likely lead to widespread adoption of the practice within gynecology.

narcotic use after hysterectomy are clinically relevant. In addition, documenting narcotic use patterns after hospi[INVESTIGATOR_523709].  
 
The use of postoperative cooling  for pain has previously been shown to be effective in a variety of procedures, including 
laparotomy ,
5 inguinal hernia repair ,6 total knee arthroplasty ,7 craniotomy ,8 oral surgery ,9 and tonsillectomy ,10 but has yet to 
be described for laparoscopic surgery.  Safety in regards to surgical site infection  (SSI)  is evidenced by  [CONTACT_523725] a robust literature demonstrating no increased rate of SSIs in total -

laparoscopic pain control despi[INVESTIGATOR_483814] a significant abdominal wound.  
 
 
Hypothesis  
The use of abdominal ice packs following laparoscopic hysterectomy will result i n improved pain control  and reduction in 
narcotic consumption compared to patients not using ice packs.  
 
Specific Aims  
1. Document average patient morphine metabolic equivalents ( MME ) consumption after laparoscopic hysterectomy from 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_523711] -discontinuation.  
2. Evaluate the effect of  abdominal ice packs vs routine care on total (MMEs) consumed by [CONTACT_523726] . 
3. Evaluate the effect of abdominal ice packs  vs routine care  on validated pain measures  during the first 12 hours after 
surgery . 
 
Is the Research aiming to answer to an unmet need of the patient (either a specific clinical need or patient 
satisfaction)? If yes, please explain in detail.  
Yes. Reducing postoperative pain and reducing postoperative narcotic use are unmet needs of the patient.  Current postop 
pain regimens for laparoscopic surgery depend heavily on narcotic and non -narcotic medications, thus there is a need for low -
cost non- medication alternatives. Furthermore, reducing narcotic use postoperatively may also reduce the risk of future 
narcotic dependence, which lies at the core of this unmet need.  
 
Research Plan and Methods  
Patients ≥ 18 years o ld undergoing laparoscopic (either conventional or robotic) hysterectomy will be recruited. Patients will 
be excluded for (a) taking opi[INVESTIGATOR_2467], including Tramadol, on a daily basis within the two weeks prior to surgery  (b) 
planned ICU admission ident ified prior to randomization, (c) conversion to laparotomy  or any incision ≥4  cm, (d) regional 
anesthesia or tap block use, and (e)  planned same -day discharge . The intent of excluding patients who are opi[INVESTIGATOR_214652], 
defined as patients who are chronically receiving opi[INVESTIGATOR_523712] a daily basis , is to prevent confounding of our specific 
aims related to total opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441].12 Patients will not be excluded due to additional surgical procedures performed  or due to 
malignancy as an indication for surgery . Trial will adh ere to CONSORT guidelines.13 
 In the preoperative area, the Brief Pain Inventory- short form  (BPI)
14,[ADDRESS_679544] (multimodal analgesia) with intraoperative narcotic guidelines. All intraoperative and postoperative 
pain management decisions will be left to the discretion of the subject’s surgeon. Following incision closure, the surgeon will determine eligibility for randomization . Subjects will be randomized , using REDcap , by a study coordinator to abdominal  ice 
pack plus routine care or routine Randomization will be stratified into two groups, patients with  chronic pelvic pain ( pain 
present for ≥ 6 months, excluding isolated dysm enorrhea) and patients without chronic pelvic pain; there will be no 
stratification for surgical approach. Blinding will not be possible for patients, physicians, or study coordinator.  
 A large zip  lock bag (size standardized)  full of ice chips, placed in side a pi[INVESTIGATOR_523713], will be placed directly on the abdomen 
prior to leaving the operating room , for subjects randomized to ice therapy. Ice will be kept on the abdomen continuously for 
the first [ADDRESS_679545] bite. U nit nurse  will check skin at minimum every 4 hours, and evaluate 
per the current Nursing Procedural Guideline: Ice Pack Use (immediate removal if skin appears mottled, gray, macerated, blister ed, and/or if patient reports extreme burning or numbness ). Any skin changes at subject discharge will be recorded as 
adverse events and prompt a protocol safety review if determined to be secondary to ice pack use (as opposed to skin prep,

 bandages, etc.) . Safety of a continuous use protocol has previously been demonstrated by [CONTACT_523727], where continuous ice 
packs were used against an abdominal incision for 24 hours in 27 patients with zero patients experiencing thermal injury. 
Anecdotally, the primary  investigator has be using continuous ice packs as described in this protocol for all laparoscopic 
hysterectomy patients since mid -2016; conservatively, over [ADDRESS_679546] used ice packs, with zero 
thermal injuries noted (the primary i nvestigator  personally sees and examines all  of his patients on postoperative day 1, after 
12-24 hours of ice pack use).  
 Demographics (i.e., age, gravida, para, BMI) and intraoperative statistics will be documented (surgical time, blood loss, uterine weig ht, additional procedures, intraoperative complications, use of pre - and/or post -incision local analgesia). During 
postoperative admission, arrival time to PACU, lowest recorded temperature, pain scores (arrival to PACU, last pain score in 
PACU, and all in patient pain scores through 12 h ours), and immediate complications will be recorded. Inpatient p ain scores 
will be abstracted from the medical record nurse charting, which per protocol are at minimum every 4 hours .  
After between 12 and 24 hours or at hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345] (whichever occurs first), subjects  will be administered a second 
survey , reflecting a compi[INVESTIGATOR_523714] . The ice group will be asked to complete the BPI  [INVESTIGATOR_200643], the  
Overall Benefit of Analgesia Score ( OBAS )
16 measure, and answer questions  assessing ice pack tolerability , satisfaction  
with pain control , and perceived adherence to use (% of time ice pack perceived to be on abdomen during first 12 h) . Routine 
care patients will only complete the BPI  [INVESTIGATOR_523715] . The OBAS is a  7-item,  validated tool specifically designed 
for post -operative assessment of pain, side effects  and satisfaction with analgesia within the first 24 hours following 
surgery17.   
 MMEs will be recorded in split timeframes: starting from subject  arrival at PACU to discharge from PACU; arrival to floor 
until 12 hours s/p surgery; 12 hours s/p surgery until hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345] ; and from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_523716] -discontinuation . 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_523717]. Subjects  will be instructed to keep unused narcotic 
medication and bring it with them for accurate use counts  at the  scheduled post -operative visit, typi[INVESTIGATOR_523718] . A medication /pain  diary will be kept by [CONTACT_523728]- type 
medications consumed, including those not prescribed for the current surgery . The diary will be kept daily until the last dose 
of narcotic pain medication is needed.  Subjects in the treatment arm will additionally record duration of ice pack use during 
the first 24 hours after hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345].  This measure will be incorporated into the diary for ease of completion.  
 At the scheduled postoperative visit, pi[INVESTIGATOR_523719], medication /pain  diary collected, and 30 -day postoperative 
complications (surgical site infections, readmissions, etc.) assessed. If patients do not return to Mayo Clinic for a postop  
exam , a prepaid envelope will be sent to have diar y returned by [CONTACT_523729]/readmissions  and pi[INVESTIGATOR_523720] . 
 
Statistics  
Descriptive statistics will be applied to demographics, intraoperative, and postoperative data. Comparisons between groups 
will be performed using  a 2-tailed t-test or Mann -Whitney U for parametric and non -parametric data as appropriate. A p-
value of 0.[ADDRESS_679547] 
on pain scores, patient satisfaction with pain control,  
 No previously published data on narcotic consumption  after discharge for any minimally invasive hysterectomy (vaginal, 
laparoscopic, robotic) could be identified  in a literature search . Chart review averaging 3 patients ’ data demonstrated average 
use of  150 MMEs after laparoscopic hysterectomy from PACU admission  to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345]. Assuming use of 20 
oxycodone 5 mg tablets following discharge yields an additional 150 MMEs; total estimated use after laparoscopic 
hysterectomy is 300  MMEs . Considering  a 20% MME reduction as clinically significant (8 x 5mg oxycodone pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353]), an alpha 
of 0.05, power of 90%, and SD of 100 MMEs with a 1:1 sampling ratio, 59 subjects  per arm (total 118) would be required to 
demonstrate a statistically significant difference. Addition of a 20% margin for losses to follow up, pre - and post -
randomization exclusions, [ADDRESS_679548] factor journal given study design and potential for patient benefit . Results are 
directly relevant to current Mayo Clinic clinical practice and could immediately be applied to patient care. Additional research on narcotic use and/or ice pack therapy in other  gynecologic  surgeries could follow , as well as evaluation in specific 
patient populations such as chronic pelvic pain. This could allow development of an area of  clinical expertise for personal

 career development . Data from this study, if positive, could tie in to the current enhanced recovery (ERAS) program adding 
to the current armamentarium. Further evaluation into other laparoscopic procedures may also be considered; grants from 
organizations such as AAGL and ACOG could be sought to support this expansion.  If a difference is noted, then more 
sophisticated ice packs or cooling systems could be an interest to Mayo Clinic Ventures and an application for device creation c ould be submitted at next available RFA.  
 
 
Timeline  
In 2016, 586 laparoscopic or robotic hysterectomies were performed at Mayo Clinic [COMPANY_002]ster. Rate of preoperative narcotic 
use in this population is unknown, but 20% estimate would be generous. This would leave about 470 patients for recruitment,  
and assuming an enrollment of 50% we are left with [ADDRESS_679549] 
recruitment, should be sufficient; [ADDRESS_679550] initiation to publication would 2 
years.

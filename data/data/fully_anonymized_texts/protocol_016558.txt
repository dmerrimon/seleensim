 Version 14: Page [ADDRESS_1214883] cancer survivors who are overweight or obese lose weight and that those 
within a normal body mass index (BMI) maintain a stable body weight. The cornerstone of 
interventions to treat or prevent obesity includes lifestyle modification with diet and exercise; 
however, integration into clinical practice is challenging due to limitations with standardization 
and scalability.  
Our collaborators from the Welch Center for Prevention, Epi[INVESTIGATOR_623], and Clinical Research at 
the Johns Hopkins University have reported impressive and sustained weight loss in randomized 
controlled trials designated Practice-based Opportunities for Weight Reduction (POWER) in 
obese women with at least one cardiovascular risk factor using a remote-support weight loss 
intervention3. This remote-support weight loss intervention of the POWER study has been 
adapted in women with early breast cancer who are overweight or obese, designated POWER-
remote, and demonstrated statistically significant weight loss of ≥5% body weight, compared to 
self-directed weight loss at [ADDRESS_1214884] cancer survivors found that 46% of women randomized to the POWER-
remote arm were able to lose ≥5% of their baseline weight as compared to only 10.9% of women 
in the self-directed arm.  
While some patients with early stage breast cancer are able to achieve significant clinically 
meaningful loss, the majority are unable to. The goal of this project is to evaluate whether weight 
loss in overweight/obese breast cancer survivors whose trajectory suggests unlikelihood of 
attaining clinically significant weight loss of ≥5% with behavioral intervention alone can be 
augmented with pharmacotherapy. Studies have shown that self-directed weight loss is generally 
not successful. Our POWER-remote study showed that 89.1% of women in the self-directed arm 
were not successful in weight loss. With the implementation of remote behavioral intervention, 
this value drops to 54% of women not being able to lose at least 5% of their weight. We will 
focus on this population of women, as they may be identified earlier (after 4-12 weeks of 
behavioral intervention). Success for this study will be measured by [CONTACT_870142]. 
As there are over [ADDRESS_1214885] cancer survivors in the US5, many of whom are 
overweight/obese, underutilization of anti-obesity drugs may be a critical and neglected 
component of weight loss treatment.  
We will evaluate the extent to which implementation of a chronic weight loss medication, 
Contrave® (Naltrexone/Bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394]), is associated with achieving ≥5% weight loss. All patients 
will receive the POWER-remote behavioral weight loss intervention (BWL) and have a 
behavioral coach for the duration of the 6 month study. During months 1-3, the behavioral coach 
will call weekly. From months 4-6, the behavioral coach will call monthly. At week 9, those who 
lose ≥5%, designated fast responders, will continue with BWL alone (FAST-BWL) while those

 Version 14: Page 9 of 86  
 who lose <5%, designated slow responders, will continue BWL and initiate Contrave (SLOW-
BWL). The SLOW-BWL arm will receive at least [ADDRESS_1214886] (as per Federal Drug 
Administration [FDA] recommended administration) starting at week 9 and discontinue if ≥5% 
weight loss is not achieved at month 6. During month 3, all participants continue to have weekly 
calls with the behavioral coach and will be asked about symptoms, which may be related to 
initiation of pharmacotherapy; any symptoms are reported to the Protocol Chair for further 
evaluation. In addition to total weight loss, we will evaluate biomarkers associated with obesity, 
microbiome and cardiometabolic factors.   
The ability of a diet and behavioral interventions to promote a more favorable microbiome 
profile, a lower BMI, and reduced levels of inflammatory cytokines, may help explain why 
vegetarian diets, and particularly vegan diets, seem to be protective against cancer growth in 
general and PC in particular.  Our study, through its focus on inflammatory biomarkers, analysis 
of fecal microbiota, and traditional metabolic endpoints such as weight loss, adiposity, insulin 
resistance and hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], will help elucidate the complex interplay between metabolic 
disorders and inflammation in breast cancer survivors.  Perhaps more importantly, we are 
confident that our study will offer breast cancer survivors a low-risk strategy to weight 
management, with tremendous potential for near-term impact on their quality of life and health 
outcomes. We will also assess certain genotypes to determine whether the effect of an adaptive 
weight loss intervention on biomarkers is greater in the patients who have a particular genotype 
(e.g. AA- SOD2). The potential increase in antioxidants in the adaptive weight loss intervention 
may enable certain patients with certain genotypes to gain greater benefit from the diet than 
others. 
Our research will address a major gap in the literature that could potentially improve quality of 
life and cancer and non-cancer outcomes for obese breast cancer patients. While many studies 
have explored various interventions for weight loss in cancer survivors, to our knowledge none 
have explored the influence of weight loss pharmacotherapy in breast cancer survivors. 
Additionally, these medications have not been studied in the setting of use of hormonal therapy, 
such as tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor. The data will be used not only to assess the impact 
of weight loss and biomarker modulation but also to design definitive studies available to all 
overweight and obese women with breast cancer whom struggle to achieve clinically significant 
weight loss despi[INVESTIGATOR_870114].

 2. SCHEMA 
 
3. HYPOTHESIS 
 In SLOW-BWL, adding Contrave at week 9 of a weight loss intervention may augment 
BWL and allow women to lose ≥5% of their baseline body weight at 6 months.  
 In SLOW-BWL, weight loss of ≥5% baseline body weight will be associated with 
changes in the following from baseline to 2 and 6 months:  
o reductions in fasting glucose, fasting insulin, total and low-density lipoprotein 
(LDL) cholesterol, triglycerides, leptin;  
o increases in high-density lipoprotein ( HDL) cholesterol and adiponectin;  
o altered gut microbiome (decrease in the ratio of bacteroides and firmacutes); and  
o improved patient reported outcomes (PROs)  
o increased total lean mass, and decreased % fat mass and visceral fat  
 Compared to women who are able to achieve at least 5% weight loss with 2 months of 
behavioral intervention alone, women who are unable to achieve ≥5% weight loss with 
behavioral intervention alone may have identifiable baseline characteristics (i.e., 
cardiometabolic profile, obesity biomarker, microbiome composition or PROs) that may 
be predictors of whom may benefit from earlier initiation of pharmacotherapy .

4.3.2 To describe baseline characteristics (cardiometabolic and obesity biomarkers, microbiome

weight and if a greater proportion of women with the AA genotype achieve ≥5% weight loss 
and improvement in biomarkers at [ADDRESS_1214891] cancer6–8.  The biological relationship between obesity 
and breast oncogenesis is mediated by [CONTACT_870143]. Obesity has been associated with 
increased levels of inflammatory cytokines, for example interleukin 1β, interleukin 6, tumor 
necrosis factor α, and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1. Altered levels of these cytokines 
drive pro-proliferative pathways, such as angiogenesis, influx of macrophages, and anti-
apoptotic pathways 9. Another untoward effect of obesity is increased synthesis of estrogens 
from androgens via augmented aromatization of androstenedione in peripheral adipose tissue.  
Breast carcinogenesis has also been associated with increased serum leptin levels and low 
adiponectin. Leptin is an adipocytokine synthesized by [CONTACT_870144] a satiety 
hormone at the hypothalamus level to reduce appetite and is paradoxically elevated in obese 
individuals 10. High levels of leptin lead to concomitant activation of various oncogenic 
pathways resulting in increased tumor growth, angiogenesis and acquisition of a migratory and

Furthermore, weight loss of at least 10% has been associated with modulation of serum and 
tissue biomarkers, such as Ki-67, adiponectin, adiponectin to leptin ratio, sex hormone binding 
globulin, estradiol, testosterone and insulin13. These biological data not only provide insight into 
how obesity can increase the risk of breast cancer, but suggests that weight loss may reverse 
some of these deleterious biological changes associated with obesity.  
5.[ADDRESS_1214893] Cancer Outcomes 
The four major cancer agencies ( International Agency for Research on Cancer  [IARC], 
American Cancer Society [ACS], American Institute for Cancer Research [AICR], and Center 
for Disease Control [CDC]) recommend that survivors maintain a stable body weight in the 
normal range and avoid weight gain14. Retrospective studies have shown that patients with breast 
cancer who are obese have an increased relative risk of recurrence by 40-50% and breast cancer-
related mortality by 53-60% 1,2. Obese women with hormone receptor positive operable breast 
cancer have inferior outcomes in terms of disease free survival (DFS) (Hazards Ratio [HR], 1.24; 
95% confidence interval [CI], 1.06-1.46; P = 0.0008) and overall survival (OS) (HR, 1.37; 95% 
CI, 1.13-1.67; P = 0.002) in comparison to non-obese group 15. Overall, approximately 15% of 
breast cancer cases in postmenopausal breast cancer survivors may be attributable to weight gain 
16. In premenopausal women, short-term weight gain may increase breast cancer risk although 
data are mixed 17.  
In the Women’s Intervention Nutrition Study (WINS), women with early stage breast cancer on 
a dietary intervention with clinically meaningful weight loss had 24% lower risk of relapse 
compared to those not receiving the intervention18. In the Women’s Healthy Eating and Living 
(WHEL) study, dietary intervention did not lead to weight loss and did not reduce breast cancer 
recurrence19. These studies suggest that alteration in diet or activity alone may not be sufficient, 
and that greater loss is required to improve breast cancer-related outcomes20. While definitive 
data are pending, initial data suggest that weight management for improved cancer related 
outcomes is an important aspect of survivorship care.  
To confirm the positive impact of weight loss on survival outcomes (such as DFS), a large 
randomized study has been designed and is actively accruing 21. The Alliance for Clinical Trials 
in Oncology Breast Cancer Weight Loss trial (BWEL, [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) is testing the [ADDRESS_1214894] of a telephone weight loss program on invasive DFS in 3136 women with a BMI 
≥27 kg/m2 with recent diagnosis of stage II-III estrogen receptor positive or triple negative breast 
cancer 22.

 Version 14: Page [ADDRESS_1214896] not demonstrated an association between hormone therapy and weight gain. 
In the Arimidex, Tamoxifen, Alone or in Combination (ATAC) trial, comparing anastrozole and 
tamoxifen, there was no significant difference in weight gain between the two therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (median 
weight gain 1.4 kg (SD 3.9) versus 1.5 kg (SD 4.0), respectively P = 0.4)25. Recent data, from the 
Exercise and Nutrition to Enhance Good Health for You (ENERGY) trial, however, suggests that 
patients receiving an AI may be less likely to gain weight than those on a selective estrogen 
receptor modulator (OR  = 0.54, 95 % CI 0.31–0.93)26. While these data may be conflicting, and 
there are numerous other variables such as chemotherapy and menopausal status that can affect 
weight gain, there is insufficient evidence to suggest endocrine agents in general cause a 
significant amount of weight gain, and efforts at weight management should be directed at 
lifestyle changes rather than therapy discontinuation.  
5.[ADDRESS_1214897] one year from surgery showed that obese and 
overweight women reported more appearance dissatisfaction (18.1 and 13.0%) than normal 
weight women (4.1%) (p=0.02). A greater proportion of overweight women (94.7%) reported 
their chest played an important role in intimacy before and after surgery as compared to normal 
weight women (80.6%), but a postoperative decline in the importance of this role was observed 
in all groups (overweight p=0.01, normal weight p<0.001) 27. Furthermore, being overweight or 
obese at baseline was associated with more problems with urinary incontinence and tendency to 
nap, and with poorer physical functioning and bodily pain (versus BMI<25 kg/m2) 28.  
Neuropathy is more common in patients who are obese.  Chemotherapy-induced 
peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) has been reported in up to 44% of patients receiving 
chemotherapy, particularly taxanes 29. Higher BMI is associated with a higher incidence of 
neuropathy, with studies demonstrating a prevalence of 48.4% in participants with normal 
weight, 60.2% in overweight participants, and 66.7% in obese participants. Compared with 
women of normal weight, being obese was associated with an increased risk of CIPN (adjusted 
OR 1.94, 95 % CI: 1.03-3.65) 30.  Increased neuropathy was significantly more likely to occur in 
overweight compared with normal weight patients receiving taxane treatment at [ADDRESS_1214898] Cancer Survivors Study  
Protocol Chair: Jennifer Sheng, M.D. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Version 14: Page [ADDRESS_1214899] found obesity to 
be associated with an increased risk of cardiac dysfunction in women using trastuzumab 34. 
Additionally, in elderly patients (over 65 years), obesity is an independent risk factor for 
trastuzumab-related cardiac toxicity 35. 
About one third of breast cancer survivors have chronic fatigue and about one fourth will have 
persistent fatigue after two years 36. Although the development of fatigue in breast 
cancer patients seems largely impacted by [CONTACT_513713], the long-term persistence of fatigue is 
related to preexisting medical conditions and lifestyle factors. Higher BMI at baseline is 
significantly associated with increased physical fatigue during and after cancer treatment 37. The 
Mammary carcinoma Risk factor Investigation (MARIE) study demonstrated that both 
physically inactive lifestyle and obesity were associated with persistent physical fatigue, 
independent of chemotherapy and radiation 38. In a study of patients who were overweight or 
obese, fatigue after chemotherapy lower in an exercise group versus a non-exercise group 39. 
Higher BMI, associated with greater tendencies to catastrophize about fatigue and amplify 
physical symptoms, was predictive of fatigue at beyond nine months 40.  These studies 
demonstrate the importance of an ideal body weight as chronic fatigue is associated with 
emotional distress and limits function and willingness to exercise.  
Lymphedema is more common in obese patients.  Cancer treatments such as lymph node 
dissection and radiotherapy can damage the lymphatic drainage routes, leading to fluid build-up, 
discomfort, and reduced mobility and function. Excess adiposity may increase risk of 
lymphedema by [CONTACT_870145], added stress to the lymphatic system, or slower healing 
times after surgery 41. Data suggests that obesity increases risk of lymphedema after treatment 
for breast cancer. Prospective studies have reported statistically significantly higher lymphedema 
risk for obese compared to normal-weight women (OR 2.48; 95% CI 1.05–5.84) 42. Breast 
cancer survivors who were obese at the time of breast cancer treatment were approximately 3.[ADDRESS_1214900] cancer survivors, a 12 week diet intervention 
resulted in a significant reduction in BMI and swollen arm volume (reduced from 24% to 15%, 
p=0.02) 44.   
5.5 Predictors of Successful Weight Loss 
Initial weight loss response at 4-12 weeks predicts weight loss at 1 year and afterward45–48. In the 
Look AHEAD trial, individuals with diabetes who lost 5% of initial weight at 2 months were 7.9 
times more likely to achieve 10% weight loss at 12 months than those whom could not achieve 
5% weight loss at [ADDRESS_1214901] 8.6% 
of initial weight and the support arm lost 0.7%. Of 2,303 patients, over 55% were slow 
responders (unable to lose >5% of initial weight at 2 months) and only 18.5% of patients in this 
group were able to achieve 10% weight loss at [ADDRESS_1214902] responders 
(losing >5% initial weight at 2 months), 63.8% succeeded in losing 10% weight at [ADDRESS_1214903] Cancer Survivors Study  
Protocol Chair: Jennifer Sheng, M.D. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Version 14: Page 15 of 86  
 Interestingly, weight loss of ≥10% has been associated with greater improvement in physical 
function as measured by [CONTACT_870146]49. A 
substudy of women in this trial demonstrates that women tend to lose less weight than men at 
one year in the intensive lifestyle intervention group versus the diabetes support and education 
group50. Unfortunately, many patients are unable to achieve clinically significant weight loss of 
≥5% and regardless of initial weight loss success, sustaining long term weight loss is 
difficult51,52. Thus, new interventions that will allow all individuals to achieve optimal and 
sustained weight loss are urgently needed.

 Version 14: Page [ADDRESS_1214907] one cardiovascular risk 
factor (n=415) demonstrated equivalent weight loss outcomes between in person coaching and a 
remote-support weight loss intervention (telephone calls by a health coach,  Fitbits to assess 
physical activity , self-directed dietary and activity monitoring, and web-based learning modules) 
3. Participants were recruited from six primary care practices in Baltimore, Maryland and 63.6% 
were women and the mean age was 54.[ADDRESS_1214908] between participants and coaches, obese 
patients achieved and sustained clinically significant weight loss over a period of 24 months. At 
6 months, 52% of participants in the intervention group and 14% of participants in the control 
group achieved ≥5% weight loss.  
An adaption of this remote intervention was implemented in a study of overweight or obese 
breast cancer survivors in a phase II single-blind trial from 2013-2015, which aimed to compare 
a remotely-delivered weight loss intervention (POWER-remote) to self-directed weight loss. At 6 
months, 46% of women randomized to the POWER-remote arm were able to lose ≥5% of their 
baseline weight as compared to only 10.9% of women in the self-directed arm4. At 12 months, 
38% of patients were able to achieve 5% weight loss with the intervention versus 13% in the 
self-directed arm. Weight loss correlated with significant decreases in leptin, and favorable 
modulation of inflammatory cytokines and lipid profiles.  
The POWER-remote is a feasible and scalable behavioral weight loss intervention. While almost 
half of patients were able to achieve ≥5% weight loss at 6 months with behavior intervention, 
only half of these women were able to maintain this at 12 months. Given evidence in the obese 
population about earlier predictors of sustainable weight loss, we plan to identify women who 
are “SLOW” responders to POWER-remote (unable to achieve at least 5% weight loss at 2 
months) and to implement pharmacotherapy to augment lifestyle modifications. We hope to 
discover novel strategies to help breast cancer survivors treat obesity and to potentially improve 
non-cancer and cancer outcomes.

such as cancer and obesity.64–67 Mn superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) is the main enzyme 
responsible for scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS) in mitochondrial oxidative stress, and 
catalyzing the dismutation of the superoxide radical (O 2−) to H2O2.68,69 There are three known 
forms of SOD: ( a) the cytosolic copper/zinc SOD; ( b) the extracellular copper/zinc SOD; and ( c)

5.8 Chronic Weight Loss Medications 
A domain that may offer enhanced behavioral approaches to weight loss includes 
pharmacotherapy81. Anti-obesity drugs, via reduction of hunger and food cravings and 
enhancement of satiety, help patients to limit the amount of food they eat, thereby [CONTACT_870147]81. Based on data demonstrating weight loss of 5% 
difference between active treatment and placebo, the FDA has approved 5 drugs for long term 
use (greater than 12 weeks) as an adjunct to lifestyle for chronic weight management in 
individuals with BMI ≥ 30.0 kg/m2 or BMI of 27.0-29.9 kg/m2 with co-morbidities such as 
hypertension, diabetes, or dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035]82,83. Although nearly half of obese patients meet BMI 
eligibility criteria for anti-obesity drugs, it is estimated that ≤3.5% receive prescriptions for these 
drugs in the US84. Barriers to the initiation or sustained use of obesity medications include lack 
of insurance coverage, safety concerns, perception of limited efficacy, and reluctance to view 
obesity as a disease requiring treatment84–87.

The most recent practice guidelines for medical care of patients with obesity by [CONTACT_870148] (AACE) Board of Directors and the American College 
of Endocrinology (ACE) Board of Trustees report that the addition of pharmacotherapy produces 
greater weight loss and weight loss maintenance compared with lifestyle therapy alone and that 
short term treatment (3-6 months) using weight loss medications has not been demonstrated to

 produce longer-term health benefits and cannot be generally recommended based on scientific 
evidence. In selecting the optimal weight loss medication for each patient, clinicians should 
consider differences in efficacy, side effects, cautions and warning that characterize medications 
approved for chronic management of obesity88. FDA-approved monotherapy options include 
phentermine (Adipex-P®), orlistat (Xenical®), lorcaserin (Belviq®) and liraglutide (Saxenda®). 
However, monotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_563589], in part due to the recruitment of alternate and 
counter-regulatory pathways.  
Consequently, a multi-target approach may provide greater benefit89. Combination products 
approved by [CONTACT_870149]/topi[INVESTIGATOR_052] (Qsymia®) and 
naltrexone/bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394] (Contrave®). Although the weight loss produced by 
[CONTACT_611456]/topi[INVESTIGATOR_870116]/bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394], the safety profile of 
naltrexone/bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_870117]. In addition, naltrexone/bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_870118], with nausea being the most reported adverse event. Unlike other centrally acting 
medications, lorcaserin and phentermine/topi[INVESTIGATOR_052], naltrexone/bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_870119]90. 
Approved by [CONTACT_109344] 2014, Contrave is an oral, sustained-release combination of 
the dopamine and norepi[INVESTIGATOR_870120]. The proposed mechanism of action of the compound involves complementary 
stimulation of central melanocortin pathways, resulting in increased energy expenditure and 
reduced appetite91. Effects may result from action on areas of the brain involved in the regulation 
of food intake: the hypothalamus (appetite regulatory center) and the mesolimbic dopamine 
circuit (reward system).  
The safety and efficacy of Contrave were assessed in four randomized, double-blind, placebo-
controlled, 56-week Phase III clinical trials in 4536 adult subjects: COR-1, COR-II, COR-
BMOD and COR-DM. All four studies demonstrated statistically significant and clinically 
meaningful weight loss following up to [ADDRESS_1214912] was 6.8% (95% CI, 6.6-7.1%) or 7.3 kg (95% CI, 
7.0-7.6 kg) at 1 year, ranging from 5.0% (5.4 kg) in patients with diabetes receiving minimal 
behavioral intervention to 9.3% (9.7 kg) in those receiving intensive behavioral treatment93. In 
all studies, significantly more participants taking Contrave achieved weight loss of at least 5% at 
1 year than placebo, ranging from 44.5% (vs 18.9%) in patients with type 2 diabetes receiving 
minimal behavioral treatment to 66.4% (vs 42.5%) in patients without diabetes undergoing 
intensive behavioral treatment. 
Additionally, across the four phase 3 studies, treatment with NB32 resulted in statistically 
significant and clinically meaningful improvements on multiple weight-related cardiometabolic 
parameters, such as fasting triglyceride levels, fasting HDL, high sensitivity C-reactive protein 
(CRP), glycemic control in patients with diabetes and fasting glucose/insulin/ Homeostatic 
Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) in nondiabetics. Furthermore, improved 
quality of life was associated with weight reduction and was achieved in more subjects treated 
with Contrave than placebo94. Weight loss was associated with significant improvement in the 
Impact of Weight on Quality of Life questionnaire-Lite (IWQOL-Lite) score compared with

treated patients compared with placebo-treated in the following subscales: 
• Physical function (all four Phase 3 studies); 
• Self-esteem (NB-301, NB-302, and NB-303);

 Version 14: Page [ADDRESS_1214913] on patients’ functioning and well-being, 
particularly physical function99. Thus, it will be important to assess the impact of weight loss and 
POWER-remote on patient-reported outcomes, including pain, fatigue, mental well-being, 
physical function, endocrine symptoms, sleep, sexual function, and medication adherence. The 
original POWER study investigated PROs using the MOS SF-12 physical component summary 
and mental component summary, the EuroQoL-5 dimensions single index and visual analog 
scale, the Patient Health Questionnaire-8 (PHQ-8) depression symptoms, and the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_22336] (PSQI) sleep quality scores at baseline and 6, 12 and 24 months. We will 
notify the primary oncology provider if the PHQ-8 score is ≥15 (moderately severe or severe 
depression).   
Physical domains were most affected, especially in subjects who lost weight. In another study 
which involved postmenopausal women undergoing a dietary and/or exercise intervention, 
weight loss predicted improvement in self-reported physical function, vitality, and mental 
health100. Since physical function has most consistently been found to be improved by [CONTACT_291661], it will be our primary PRO. Studies in cancer patients suggest a 4-6 point change in score in 
Physical Function using the National Institute of Health (NIH) Patient-Reported Outcome 
Measurement Information System (PROMIS) questionnaire to be clinically meaningful101.  Since 
minimally important differences is usually estimated by [CONTACT_870150], and in conjunction with the aforementioned studies, we conservatively hypothesize 
that, compared to baseline, weight loss at 6 months will be associated with an increase of five 
points in PROMIS, as determined by [INVESTIGATOR_13949] 1 short-form to assess physical function. This form 
was also used in the POWER-remote study.  
We will also administer a questionnaire to evaluate modulation in other PROs including: pain, 
fatigue, mental well-being, sleep, endocrine symptoms, and sexual function. Participants will 
also complete a drug diary to monitor medication adherence.

 Version 14: Page [ADDRESS_1214921] 16 phone sessions for each participant. We anticipate 
enrolling 2-4 participants per month. All women will receive the POWER remote behavioral 
weight loss intervention (BWL) and a behavioral coach. They will all receive lifestyle guidelines 
(See Appendix B). At week 9, those who lose ≥5%, designated fast responders, will continue 
with BWL alone (FAST-BWL) while those who lose <5%, designated slow responders, will 
receive BWL with the addition of Contrave (SLOW-BWL).  
Women in SLOW-BWL will initiate Contrave one 8-mg naltrexone/90-mg bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_870122] 3 weeks to the maintenance dosage of two 8-mg/90-mg tablets twice 
daily, for a total daily dose of 32mg/360mg. It should be taken by [CONTACT_870151], chewed, or crushed. In clinical trials, Contrave was 
administered with meals. However, it should not be taken with a high-fat meal because of a 
resulting significant increase in bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_870123]. As patients are 
instructed to follow the DASH ( Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) and/or Mediterranean 
diet, this should not be an issue. Patients will be instructed that ketogenic and low carbohydrate 
diets would impact the absorption of Contrave.  
The behavioral coach will review the weekly weight and new symptoms entry (patient will 
completed in REDCap survey or via telephone if not done) for months 3-6 for participants in 
both arms. The REDCap survey (Appendix C) asks patients about any new symptoms and 
includes examples of those which had a frequency of at least 4% in patients on Contrave in 
clinical trials. Any new symptoms noted will be directed to the Protocol Chair for further 
evaluation. If patients on Contrave have significant adverse effects, providers will decrease the 
dose by 50% and assess tolerability over [ADDRESS_1214922] Cancer Survivors Study  
Protocol Chair: Jennifer Sheng, M.D. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Version 14: Page [ADDRESS_1214923], dose can be lowered by 50% again. If symptoms 
are alleviated, patient can continue at lowered dose. However, if symptoms persist, the 
medication should be discontinued and the patient should continue with BWL alone. Following 
the prescribing information, Contrave will be discontinued for patients who do not achieve ≥5% 
and seen in person once a month to assess compliance and potential side effects.  
The weight loss intervention  is based on the remote-support arm of the POWER trial that was 
also used by [CONTACT_378777] a previous study in breast cancer survivors3,4. It involves two main 
components: an online portion that participants access on their computer or phone and a 
telephone/teleconferencing portion to help monitor progress and deliver the behavioral 
intervention. All participants will receive the POWER intervention, which will be remote and 
last 6 months. Participants will be given a physical activity monitor (Fitbit) that encourages 
increased activity by [CONTACT_870152], such as heart rate and sleep. 
Participants will use a web-based platform to access learning materials and log their diet and 
exercise each day. They will also record their weight once weekly through our survey. As 
participants monitor their own progress, they will receive telephone/teleconferencing calls on a 
regular schedule by a weight loss coach to help monitor and guide progress utilizing dietary, 
physical activity and weight information. All contacts will be phone/teleconferencing based and 
last about [ADDRESS_1214924] 3 months (a 
baseline visit followed by 12 phone sessions) and monthly for the remaining 3 months (3 phone 
sessions). At the conclusion of the study after [ADDRESS_1214925] an in-person visit.  
7.3.1 Screening (by [CONTACT_25600]) 
 Informed consent  
 History and physical information will be noted from most recent, standard of care 
assessment included in the medical records.  (NOTE:  Participants who may be referred 
from outside the institution may meet with a medical/clinical member of the study staff at 
baseline; however, a documented H&P by a study team member is not required.) 
 Physical measurements (weight and height) as per patient or chart for BMI calculation 
 Review of weight loss history 
 Collect current medications and medication history 
 Smartphone access and/or access to programs online 
 Assess willingness to change diet, physical activity, track behaviors, engage in weekly 
and monthly contacts and visit, and take chronic weight loss medication (yes/no question 
format) 
 Through REDCap, baseline questionnaire should be completed at home ≤[ADDRESS_1214926] Cancer Survivors Study

 continue/enroll in the study.  NOTE: Patients who complete a screening visit, but who are 
not eligible, will be offered the “Aim for healthy weight” handout (Appendix D).  
7.3.2 Baseline Visit 
The Baseline Visit is in-person and should ideally occur within 8 weeks of the screening visit; 
with baseline questionnaires completed ≤8 weeks prior. 
 Written informed consent 
 Physical measurements (weight and height) and BMI calculations 
 Vital signs (temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, breathing rate, oxygen level) 
 Complete medical history and overall general health (performance status) 
 If a documented physical exam is not performed within 3 months, this will be performed 
at or after baseline visit (but before initiation of the behavioral intervention) 
 Meet with weight-loss coach  
 Receive Fitbit device for monitoring physical activity (participants will wear this on their 
non-dominant hand for a minimum of 4 of 7 days with 10 hours per day) 
 Receive weight scale 
 Check heart rate and blood pressure 
 Confirm current medications and medication history  
 Blood sample (Pregnancy test for < 60 years of age and not taking medication designed 
to suppress ovarian function. Will advise contraception for these women.) 
 Fecal sample 
 Orientation to Fitbit website or smartphone platform by [CONTACT_870153] 
 Confirm completion of PROs (or complete in clinic, if needed) 
 
IMPORTANT:  Eligibility will be confirmed at the baseline visit.  Participants with a BMI of 
≥27 at the screening visit, but with a BMI of <[ADDRESS_1214927] 
maintained eligibility and will be excluded at present. In addition, if there is ≥2 kg/m2 
discrepancy between the screening and baseline visits, the Protocol Chair or designee must 
be consulted to review the discrepancy; this is to determine that the study endpoints will not 
be affected by [CONTACT_298888]/changing weight. 
7.3.3 Follow-Up Visits 
Participants will be asked to attend in-person follow-up visits at 2 months and 6 months.

 Weight and BMI calculations 
 Confirm completion of PROs (or complete in clinic, if needed) 
 Collect current medications and medication history 
 Blood samples* 
 Fecal sample 
*Blood will be collected while patient is fasting when possible (i.e., 9-12 hours preferred). Will 
provide patients with juice or bar after labs. Additionally, participants will be asked to be fasting 
for follow-up visits even in cases when blood samples are not planned to allow for consistency of 
anthropomorphic data collection.  
In participants who discontinue early, the next planned assessments will be completed early 
whenever possible (e.g., a participant that withdraws at 6 weeks will be asked to complete week 
9 assessment; a participant withdraw at 5 months, the end of study assessment). The last visit 
should be scheduled once the participant has received the full 6 month intervention.  
 
7.4 Measurements 
7.4.1 Weight: will be measured at each in-person visit, at approximately the same time of day. 
The weights are obtained at baseline, week 9 and at the end of study. The ideal weight 
measurement should be obtained within 7 days of completing the 8 weeks and 6 months 
behavioral intervention. However, to accommodate participants who may not be able to meet 
within this window, the weight measurement can be obtained within 14 days of these time 
points. Weight in light indoor clothes without shoes will be recorded by [CONTACT_870154], certified 
staff using a high-quality digital scale in any of our Johns Hopkins Medical Institute (JHMI) 
clinics. Duplicate measurements will be made to ensure accuracy. Weight will be measured in 
pounds for ease of interpretation by [CONTACT_870155]. Scales will be calibrated per the Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center’s 
(SKCCC) standards.  The engineering department or study staff will perform quarterly 
calibration checks by [CONTACT_870156]. The weight at SV will be used to determine 
eligibility. Measurements will be repeated once, if difference between the two measurements is 
more than 0.1 kg, measurement will be repeated until difference between two measurements is 
less than 0.1 kg.  
7.4.2 Height: to the nearest 0.1 cm will be measured once at any of our JHMI clinics. The 
participant stands shoeless on a firm, level surface, with her head in the horizontal (Frankfort) 
plane. Measurements will be repeated once, if difference between the two measurements is more 
than 1 cm, measurement will be repeated until difference between two measurements is less than 
1 cm. 
7.4.3 BMI: will be calculated as the Quetelet index (kg/m2)

 Version 14: Page 27 of 86  
 NOTE:  All physical measurements should be taken by a member of the study team or an 
appropriate clinical employee (e.g., clinical associate who regularly collects physical 
measurements). 
7.4.4 Daily steps: are measured by [CONTACT_163679]. Fitbit devices use a 3-axis Fitbit to understand your 
motions. An Fitbit is a device that turns movement (acceleration) into digital measurements 
(data) when attached to the body. 
7.4.5 Intensity of physical activity (also known as MVPA, which is moderate to vigorous 
physical activity): is measured by [CONTACT_870157]-Time Exercise Questionnaire. Leisure-time 
physical activity is an important subtype of physical activity (PA) for research and behavior 
change intervention in oncology context. This is a 3-item self-administered questionnaire with 
the first three questions seeking information on the number of times one engages in mild, 
moderate and vigorous PA bouts of at least 15 min duration in a typi[INVESTIGATOR_3711]. Examples of PA 
are provided for each intensity category. Scores derived from the questionnaire include total 
weekly PA, called a Leisure Score Index (LSI), in which number of bouts at each intensity is 
multiplied by 3, 5, and 9 metabolic equivalents (METs) and summed. LSI scores can be used for 
ranking individuals from the lowest to highest PA levels. In addition, the score obtained from 
MVPA can be used to classify respondents into active and insufficiently active  categories 
according to published PA guidelines for cancer survivors.  
7.5 Questionnaires 
7.5.1 Clinical and Demographic Information  
The designated research coordinator(s) participating in this project will enter clinical information 
associated with each participant in the database. Such data could include, but is not limited to: 
medical record number, age, sex, physical measurements, treatment history, tumor size, tumor 
grade, tumor receptor status, pathology report, smoking history. Such information will be 
retrieved from existing clinical databases (e.g., Johns Hopkins Electronic Patient Record) and 
patient questioning.  
Participants will be asked to provide contact [CONTACT_870158], or if the participant 
assumes care outside the institution. In addition, participants may be reached by [CONTACT_870159], or additional follow-up requirements.  
Participants will also be asked about current medications at each visit. This will be documented 
in the electronic medical record.

fatigue, mental well-being, endocrine symptoms, sleep, sexual function, and medication 
adherence, at baseline, 2, and 6 months following initiation of the intervention. Pain, fatigue, 
mental well-being, sleep, and physical function will be assessed using the NIH PROMIS 
questionnaire; endocrine symptoms with the FACT-endocrine symptoms, and sexual function

 Version 14: Page [ADDRESS_1214929] for the Fitbit website, and 
will be oriented on how to use the website; an email address will also be recorded for each 
participant.  Participants will receive e-mail reminders when it is time for them to complete the 
REDCap questionnaire. They will be encouraged to complete the questionnaire prior to any 
planned clinic visit; however, they will be informed that a research coordinator can assist them 
prior to their visit if they prefer to complete the questionnaire at the clinic. Whether patients 
complete the PRO questionnaire at home or in the clinic, they will access the questionnaires via 
the internet. At follow-up clinic visits for patients who completed the PRO questionnaires, 
clinician sub-investigators will have a summary report available to them via REDCap.  
Questionnaires will focus on some basic background information and patient reported outcomes, 
with more detailed survey information as follows. Data from the questionnaires will be available 
for export into spreadsheets or other tools for analysis. 
NOTE: In the event that questionnaires through REDCap are not available, we will use paper-
based questionnaires.  
The questions that will be included in the REDCap system are included in Appendix E. Score 
interpretation is in Appendix F.  Domains that will be included in REDCap are as follows: 
 General health and physical function will be assessed using NIH PROMIS Adult Physical 
Function Short Form 1102. The physical function item bank measures self-reported 
capability rather than actual performance of physical activities, and generally includes the 
functioning of one’s upper extremities (dexterity), lower extremities (walking or 
mobility), and central regions (neck, back), as well as instrumental activities of daily 
living, such as running errands. A single physical function capability score is obtained 
from a short form, and has been validated in adults with chronic illnesses. 
 Pain will be assessed using the NIH Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information 
System (PROMIS) adult pain interference version 1.[ADDRESS_1214930] deviation (SD) of 10. Therefore, a person who has a T-
score of [ADDRESS_1214931] been previously reported103. 
 Fatigue will be measured using the NIH PROMIS Adult Fatigue Version 1.0 short form. 
The NIH fatigue question bank evaluates a range of self-reported symptoms, from mild 
subjective feelings of tiredness to an overwhelming, debilitating, and sustained sense of 
exhaustion that likely decreases one’s ability to execute daily activities and function. 
Fatigue is divided into the experience of fatigue (frequency, duration, and intensity) and

 Version 14: Page [ADDRESS_1214932] deviation (SD) of 10. Therefore, a 
person who has a T-score of 40 is one SD below the U.S. general population mean. 
Reliability and validity of the fatigue assessment in cancer patients has been reported104. 
 Mental health will be evaluated using the NIH PROMIS Depression and Anxiety 
questionnaires. The Adult Depression Version 1.0 Short Form is an 8 question survey, 
and the Adult Anxiety Version 1.0 Short Form is a 7-item survey, for a total of 15 mental 
health questions. The depression item bank assesses self-reported negative mood 
(sadness, guilt), views of self-criticism, worthlessness), and social cognition (loneliness, 
interpersonal alienation), as well as decreased positive affect and engagement (loss of 
interest, meaning, and purpose). The anxiety item bank measures self-reported fear 
(fearfulness, panic), anxious misery (worry, dread), hyperarousal (tension, nervousness, 
restlessness), and somatic symptoms related to arousal (racing heart, dizziness). The 
anxiety and depression scores are calculated individually, in the same way all PROMIS 
scores are calculated as above. 
 Endocrine symptoms will be assessed using the endocrine subscale of the Functional 
Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Endocrine Symptom questionnaire. The Endocrine 
Subscale was designed for use with the FACT-B (Functional Assessment of Cancer 
Therapy for breast cancer patients) but has been tested on its own105. It comprises 18 
items in which patients indicate how true a statement has been for them over the prior 7 
days using a 5-point scale.  
 Disturbance in sleep or sleep changes on therapy will be evaluated with the NIH 
PROMIS Adult Sleep Disturbance Version 1.0 Short Form. The sleep disturbance item 
bank assesses self-reported perceptions of sleep quality, sleep depth, and restoration 
associated with sleep over the 7 days before questionnaire administration. This includes 
perceived difficulties and concerns with getting to sleep or staying asleep, as well as 
perceptions of the adequacy of and satisfaction with sleep106. 
 Changes in sexual function will be evaluated using the MOS Sexual Functioning Scale, 
which consists of four items assessing interest in sex, ability to relax and enjoy sex, 
arousal, and ability to have an orgasm. Items are rated on a 5-point scale (1=not a 
problem, 2=little of a problem, 3=somewhat of a problem, 4=very much of a problem, 
and 5=not applicable). This scale is useful for measuring sexual function in both men and 
women. It has demonstrated good reliability and construct validity in breast cancer 
patients107. 
 Medication adherence will be assessed using the institutional drug diary (APPENDIX G).  
7.5.3 Nutritional and Physical Activity Assessments 
Fruit and vegetable consumption will be measured with National Institutes of Health’s Eating at 
America’s Table study108.  Participants will be asked various questions regarding the frequency 
and quantity of various food groups in the past month. A total score is calculated by [CONTACT_870161]: Jennifer Sheng, M.D. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Version 14: Page [ADDRESS_1214933] scale for each food category, multiplying by [CONTACT_5206], and summing. 
This questionnaire will be implemented at baseline and follow-up visits (See Appendix E and F). 
Participants will wear the Fitbit on their non-dominant hand for seven days and a minimum of 
four days with ten hours per day of wear time required for analyses. Fitbits have been determined 
to be reliable and valid measures of physical activity109. Established cut-points will be used to 
determine minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity110. Average daily physical activity 
will be normalized and reported as minutes per week of moderate to vigorous physical activity. 
The Fitbits will also capture process variables, such as heart rate and steps.  
7.[ADDRESS_1214934] received and might still be taking (e.g., hormonal, anti-HER2 agents), 
expected side effects from prior or ongoing therapy (e.g., fatigue, neuropathy, lymphedema, hot 
flashes), scheduled standard clinic visits and tests, and symptoms disconcerting for a recurrence. 
Coaches will discuss additional dietary and physical activity recommendations that are standard 
for breast cancer patients such as moderation of alcohol intake. Patients are provided with 
modules of recommended exercises per American College of Sports Medicine and American 
Cancer Society recommendations, particularly in reference to lymphedema prevention111.  
The participants will have access to a web-based platform which provides support for lifestyle 
counseling in behavioral methods of weight management; a summary of the support and methods 
will be given at the first/in-person visit with the weight loss coach. Participants in this group will 
be encouraged to record diet, exercise, and weight on this web-based platform. Web-links to 
health related websites may also be left by [CONTACT_36771]. These participants will receive usual 
medical care from their providers (i.e., oncologists and primary care physicians). Providers will 
support and encourage participants to be actively engaged in the lifestyle counseling 
intervention.  
7.6.1 Goals 
The goals of this intervention (from months 3-6) are to induce weight loss of 5% or more by 
[CONTACT_870162] 5% weight loss with lifestyle modifications alone. 
7.6.2 Description and delivery of the intervention 
Participants in this group will receive a behavioral weight loss intervention consisting of:  
 Teleconferencing and/or phone calls by [CONTACT_102224] (see frequency of contacts below);  
 A lifestyle counseling curriculum delivered via the web (hard copi[INVESTIGATOR_870124]); and

 Version 14: Page 31 of 86  
  Online tools for behavioral self-monitoring.  
7.6.3 The lifestyle curriculum: 
The lifestyle curriculum consists of learning materials which will be provided in a binder and can 
be provided electronically. The curriculum focuses on self-monitoring, behavioral strategies for 
modifying eating behavior and increasing physical activity, stimulus control, social support, 
problem solving, and cognitive restructuring. Goal setting is also a key component of the 
intervention.  
7.6.4 Self-Monitoring 
All participants are advised to:  
 Record weight at least once each week.  
 Record daily: minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) in bouts of [ADDRESS_1214935] 
Participants receive teleconferencing/telephone calls weekly for 3 months and monthly thereafter 
from lifestyle coaches to encourage completion of learning materials modules, to reinforce key 
learning points, and to encourage logging and provide feedback on weight, food intake, and 
exercise tracking. Calls will be each week for months 1-3, once a month for months 4-6. Each 
call will be approximately 30-45 minutes long. For all participants, coaches will also review 
and/or inquire about any new symptoms (weekly during months 4-6) and adherence if they are 
assigned to the arm with the pharmacotherapy. If symptoms are reported, the coach will notify 
the physician on study and the patient may be contact[CONTACT_870163].  
7.6.6 Assessment of adherence 
Adherence to intervention for participants will be based on completion of coach contacts and 
modules, and online self-monitoring of weight, food intake, and exercise. Additionally, patients 
on the SLOW-BWL arm will complete a drug diary log during the one-month long titration 
(APPENDIX G). Patients will e-mail their logs to the study team for review.

 # Physical exam: may be performed and documented up to 3 months prior to baseline visit by a co-
investigator or provider within the institution. Or physical exam may be performed at or after 
baseline visit (but before initiation of the behavioral intervention) 
## Baseline visits should occur within 8 weeks of screening visit. Follow up visits should occur 
within 8 weeks of assessment date.  
NOTE: Additional standard of care tests may be performed at the discretion of the treating 
investigator as clinically indicated. The schedule should be followed as closely as is realistically 
possible; however, the schedule may be modified due to problems such as scheduling delays or 
conflicts (e.g., clinic closure, poor weather conditions, vacations, etc.) with the guidance of the 
PI/designee, as appropriate, and will not be reportable as a deviation unless the endpoints of the 
study or subject safety are affected.  
In order to minimize the need for research-only in-person visits, telemedicine visits may be 
substituted for in person clinical trial visits or portions of clinical trial visits where determined to 
be appropriate and where determined by [CONTACT_345338]. 
Prior to initiating telemedicine for study visits the study team will explain to the participant, what 
a telemedicine visit entails and confirm that the study participant is in agreement and able to 
proceed with this method. Telemedicine acknowledgement will be obtained in accordance with 
the Guidance for Use of Telemedicine in Research. In the event telemedicine is not deemed 
feasible, the study visit will proceed as an in-person visit. Telemedicine visits will be conducted 
using HIPAA compliant method approved by [CONTACT_164870]. 
9. CORRELATIVE STUDIES  
9.1 Blood Samples 
9.1.1 Collection 
Approximately 15 mL (3 tubes) of blood will be collected at each time point (a standard 5 mL 
tube for lipid panel and Hba1c, one 10 mL red/gray research tubes). An additional [ADDRESS_1214945] glucose, insulin, lipid profiles 
(total cholesterol, HDL, LDL, and triglycerides), leptin and adiponectin, several fasting 
biomarkers, and various genotypes (e.g. MnSOD). The samples will be processed by [CONTACT_870164] (See Lab Manual). In the event that blood cannot be collected, 
the subject may still take part in the other portions of the study.

10. ADVERSE EVENTS  
10.1 General 
This study will use the descriptions and grading scales found in the revised National Cancer 
Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 4.0 for adverse 
event reporting that can be found at http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html. Information about 
all related adverse events, whether volunteered by [CONTACT_423], discovered by [CONTACT_70721], or detected through physical examination, laboratory test or other means, will be 
collected, recorded, and followed as appropriate. 
It should be noted that only those adverse events believed to be related to the weight loss 
intervention will be collected and tabulated during the course of the study.  The side effects with 
 
Adapative Weight Loss for Breast Cancer Survivors Study  
Protocol Chair: Jennifer Sheng, M.D. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Version 14: Page 37 of 86  
 the weight loss intervention we might encounter include anxiety and frustration. While this 
program is not designed to cause radical weight loss, in the unlikely event this were to occur 
radical weight loss can cause several medical implications including dehydration, malnutrition, 
electrolyte disturbances, headaches, nausea, and tachycardia. Blood samples for research 
correlated will require intravenous access which may include discomfort, bruising and, rarely, 
infection, syncope, or significant bleeding; these will be collected at planned standard of care 
testing, whenever possible.   
10.[ADDRESS_1214950] the participants' safety, we will continuously reinforce our recommendation to 
engage in moderate-intensity physical activity.  We will also recommend a safety evaluation by 
[CONTACT_870165] (PCP) for those participants who wish to progress to vigorous 
physical activity.  Still, it is important to acknowledge the participant autonomy.  We can 
recommend that participants follow safety advice but cannot force them to do so.   
10.2.2 Nutrient Intake 
Calorie restriction can theoretically lead to inadequate nutrition or excessive, rapid weight loss 
(>10% weight loss within 4 weeks or a total weight loss of >25%).  If a participant loses >10% 
weight within 4 weeks, the team will review the patient’s food diary to ensure that they are not 
over restricting their calories (e.g., <1000 daily). If people achieve more than a 25% weight loss, 
then the team will evaluate for cancer (recurrence in our population), eating disorders, and 
hyperthyroidism. To minimize these risks, participants are encouraged to eat a variety of foods 
from all food groups and to maintain an adequate calorie level. If nutritional deficiency is 
suspected and unresponsive to advice from the interventionist, the intervention will be suspended 
and the participant will be referred to her PCP. Participants will be advised that marked and 
sustained caloric restriction can have serious health risks, e.g., malnutrition.  
10.2.[ADDRESS_1214951] the potential to increase the risk of hypoglycemia, especially 
during the time when diet and/or physical activity interventions are implemented. For this reason 
we will exclude patients who take insulin or sulfonylureas. We will allow patients to enroll if 
their diabetes is controlled on metformin. If participants have a drop in HbA1c to <6.5 or if they 
require a change in diabetic medications during this study, they will be overseen by [CONTACT_870166]/or co-investigator and the PCP will be notified of these changes.

 Version 14: Page [ADDRESS_1214952] will notify the Protocol Chairof participants who develop symptomatic hypotension 
while on anti-hypertensive medications. Changes in blood pressure regimen may be performed 
by [CONTACT_70712]/or co-investigators and the participant’s PCP will be notified. 
10.2.5 Cardiovascular Events 
All participants with cardiovascular disease (CVD) require approval from their PCP and Protocol 
Chair prior to enrolling.  If this medical condition is not felt to be stable, patients will be 
excluded from this study. In addition, participants are educated about CVD symptoms and urged 
to contact [CONTACT_870167] a change in their CVD symptoms. Overall CVD management 
remains under the control of the participant’s PCP. 
10.2.[ADDRESS_1214953] 
The pharmacotherapy could lead to adverse effects: nausea (NB32 29%, NB16 27%). Headache 
(NB32 13%, NB16 27%), constipation (NB32 15%, NB16 15%), dizziness (NB32 9%, NB16 
7%), insomnia (NB32 7%, NB16 6%), vomiting (NB32 9%, NB16 6%), and dry mouth (NB32 
7%, NB16 7%)95. Adverse events were most frequently gastrointestinal in nature. The most 
common of these, nausea was generally mild to moderate in intensity, transient, and did not 
result in discontinuation for most participants who reported it. Nausea was typi[INVESTIGATOR_870126]; the rate of onset seemed to plateau shortly 
after reaching full dose and then was similar to the rate reported in the placebo group. The most 
frequent adverse events leading to discontinuation before week 26 included nausea (10.5%); 
anxiety (3.3%); and headache, hypertension, insomnia and palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814] (1.3% each)98. While 
attrition across all phase III studies of Contrave ranged from 42% to 50%, only 24% of those 
taking Contrave withdrew due to adverse events (vs 12% taking placebo)93.  
Participants will be educated about the side effect profile and urged to contact [CONTACT_870168]. Depending on the severity of the side effect, the dosage may be 
decreased or discontinued entirely. Patients whom are discontinued on the pharmacotherapy will 
continue the study with BWL alone. Changes in overall management of hypertension remain 
under the control of the PI. 
10.2.[ADDRESS_1214954] fatigue and the 
possibility of minor psychological distress. Participants are instructed that they may refuse to 
answer any questions. 
10.3 Definitions 
 Adverse event (AE): Any undesirable sign, symptom or medical condition occurring after 
starting therapy even if the event is not considered to be related to the study. An 
undesirable medical condition can be symptoms (e.g., nausea, chest pain), signs (e.g. , 
 
Adapative Weight Loss for Breast Cancer Survivors Study  
Protocol Chair: Jennifer Sheng, M.D. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Version 14: Page 39 of 86  
 tachycardia) or the abnormal results of an investigation (e.g. , laboratory findings, 
biopsies).  
Medical conditions/diseases present before starting study treatment are only considered 
adverse events if they worsen after starting study treatment (any procedures specified in 
the protocol). Adverse events occurring before starting study treatment but after signing 
the informed consent form will be recorded. Abnormal laboratory values or test results 
constitute adverse events only if they induce clinical signs or symptoms or require 
therapy. 
 Serious adverse event or reaction: Any untoward medical occurrence secondary to 
therapy that: results in death, is immediately life-threatening, requires inpatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], results in persistent or 
significant disability / incapacity, or is an important medical event that may jeopardize 
the subject or may require medical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed 
above. 
The definition of serious adverse event (experience) also includes important medical 
event. Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited 
reporting is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not 
be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_870127]. These should also usually be considered serious.  
A hospi[INVESTIGATOR_773836](s) and/or for a preexisting 
condition that has not worsened does not constitute a serious adverse event (e.g., elective 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_870128]).  A hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a 
social reason in the absence of an adverse event also does not meet the criteria for a 
serious adverse event. 
 Unexpected adverse event: An adverse event, which varies in nature, intensity or 
frequency from information on the investigational intervention provided in the 
Investigator’s Brochure, package insert or safety reports. Any adverse event that is not 
included in the informed consent is considered “unexpected”. 
 Expected (known) adverse event: An adverse event, which has been reported in the 
Investigator’s Brochure. An adverse event is considered “expected”, only if it is included 
in the informed consent document as a risk. 
10.4 Relationship 
The relationship of all adverse events and serious adverse events to study medication will be 
assessed by [CONTACT_773861]: 
 Definitely: An adverse event which has a timely relationship to the administration of the 
investigational drug/agent, follows a known pattern of response, for which no alternative 
cause is present.  
 Probably: An adverse event, which has a timely relationship to the administration of the 
investigational drug/agent, follows a known pattern of response, but for which a potential 
alternative cause may be present.  
 
Adapative Weight Loss for Breast Cancer Survivors Study

 Version 14: Page 40 of 86  
  Possibly: An adverse event, which has a timely relationship to the administration of the 
investigational drug/agent, follows no known pattern of response, but a potential 
alternative cause does not exist. 
 Unlikely: An adverse event which does not have a timely relationship to the 
administration of the investigational drug/agent, follows no known pattern of response, 
does not reappear or worsen after re-administration of the investigational drug/agent (if 
applicable), and for which there is evidence that it is related to a cause other than the 
investigational drug/agent. 
 Unrelated: An adverse event, for which there is evidence that it is definitely related to a 
cause other than the investigational drug/agent. In general, there is no timely relationship 
to the administration of the investigational drug/agent, or if there is a timely relationship, 
the event does not follow a known pattern of response, and there is an alternative cause 
10.5 Reporting Procedures 
10.5.1 General 
All adverse events will be captured on the appropriate study-specific case report forms (CRFs) 
through CRMS and REDCap. The Coordinating Center may also periodically request that de-
identified AE logs and deviation logs be submitted via encrypted email, such as for annual 
continuing review. 
10.5.[ADDRESS_1214955] (IRB) 
All adverse events and serious adverse events will be reported to the IRB per current institutional 
standards. If an adverse event requires modification of the informed consent, these modifications 
will be provided to the IRB with the report of the adverse event. If an adverse event requires

Registration Program (CTRP).  
12.5.1 JHM Single IRB 
Johns Hopkins Medicine is serving as the single IRB for this study. It is the preference of Johns 
Hopkins Medicine IRB to use the SMART IRB reliance agreement as the basis of reliance. The 
SMART IRB master reliance agreement was created in 2016 to harmonize and streamline the 
IRB review process for multisite studies. It enables reliance on a study-by-study basis, clearly 
defines roles and responsibilities of relying institutions and reviewing IRBs, and eliminates the 
need to sign reliance agreements for each study [e.g., a non-SMART IRB agreement]. 900+ 
institutions have already signed onto this agreement and are actively using it as the basis of 
reliance for multisite projects. Sites that will rely on JHM IRB are still responsible for 
conducting a local context review prior to the start of research at their site and for following any 
local and institutionally required policies as it applies to research at their site [e.g., reporting of 
unanticipated problems]. 
 
13. DATA ANALYSIS AND STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
13.1 Study Design 
This is a prospective, non-randomized clinical trial assessing the effects of the addition of 
pharmacotherapy to a behavioral weight loss intervention in overweight/obese breast cancer 
patients on an AI who are unable to attain at least 5% weight loss after 8 weeks of lifestyle 
intervention alone.  
All enrolled patients will participate in a 6-month BWL program. At week 9, patients who 
achieve ≥5% weight loss from baseline will continue with BWL (FAST-BWL). Those failing to 
achieve a minimum of 5% weight loss will receive Contrave in addition to BWL (SLOW-BWL). 
After a 4-week titration of Contrave, SLOW-BWL will have their drug adherence logs and any 
new symptoms reviewed by [CONTACT_70712]/or co-investigators. The participants will be 
prescribed the constant dose for 3 months until the end of study (drug will be shipped to patient’s 
home).  
The primary endpoint of this study is the proportion of SLOW-BWL patients who achieve at 
least 5% weight loss of their enrollment baseline weight at [ADDRESS_1214964] to BWL. We anticipate 55% of [ADDRESS_1214965]-BWL women.  
The secondary endpoints include baseline, 2 and 6 months values in all participants for the 
following: cardiometabolic biomarkers (fasting glucose, fasting lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], fasting insulin, adiponectin 
and leptin levels), genotypes, microbiome composition, body composition, patient-reported 
outcomes (PROs), and physical activities. 
Simon's two-stage minimax design will be used for the SLOW-BWL group. The null hypothesis 
that the true rate of attaining ≥5% weight loss is 10.9%, which is chosen based on the rate of 
 
Adapative Weight Loss for Breast Cancer Survivors Study  
Protocol Chair: Jennifer Sheng, M.D. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Version 14: Page 45 of 86  
 women attaining ≥5% weight loss in the self-directed arm in the POWER-remote study.[ADDRESS_1214966] stage, 15 SLOW-BWL women will be accrued. If there is 1 or fewer woman out of the 15 
women who attain ≥5% weight loss of their baseline weight, the study will be stopped. Otherwise, 
15 additional SLOW-BWL women will be accrued for a total of 30 SLOW-BWL patients. The 
study does not plan to hold enrollment or treatment for the interim analysis. The null hypothesis 
will be rejected if 7 or more women are observed in the 30 patients who attain ≥5% weight loss. 
This design yields a power of 80% at type I error rate of 5% when the true rate of attaining ≥5% 
weight loss of the baseline weight for the SLOW-BWL women is 29%, a clinical meaningful rate 
for the SLOW-BWL women group. 
Our results will inform us of how to better treat obesity in this vulnerable group of breast cancer 
patients. It may allow us to develop larger adaptive trials to assess long term breast cancer and 
non-cancer outcomes of behavioral interventions that incorporate pharmacotherapy. 
Additionally, our results may shed light on other modulators or obesity, such as biomarkers and 
the microbiome, laying foundation to future trials investigating additional interventions in breast 
cancer survivors who struggle with weight loss.  
13.2 Analysis Plans 
Data will be summarized using descriptive statistics (continuous data) and/or contingency tables 
(categorical data) for demographic and baseline characteristics, efficacy measurements at 2 and 6 
months, and safety measurements throughout the study. 
For the primary analysis, the study will be considered successful if there are 7 or more SLOW-
BWL patients who could achieve more than 5% weight loss compared to their baseline weight, 
which implies that the success rate regarding to >=5% weight loss will be significantly higher 
than 10.9%. 
Univariate analysis will be conducted to compare outcomes at different time points including 
baseline, 2 months and 6 months, and to compare outcomes from different groups including 
SLOW-BWL patients who attain ≥5% weight loss or <5% weight loss of their enrollment 
baseline weight at 6 months and FASE-BWL patients. Wilcoxon rank sum and Wilcoxon sign 
rank tests will be conducted when appropriate. Student’s t-test will also be performed when the 
outcomes are normally distributed after necessary data transformation. Moreover, mixed effect 
regression analysis will be conducted to evaluate the longitudinal trend in the outcomes at 
different time points.  
Furthermore, multivariate logistic regression analysis will be conducted to evaluate the effect of 
the baseline characteristics on attaining ≥5% weight loss of the baseline weight at [ADDRESS_1214967] of the baseline 
characteristics and the weight loss at 2 months on attaining ≥5% weight loss of the baseline 
weight at [ADDRESS_1214968] Cancer Survivors Study

 Version 14: Page 46 of 86  
 The primary analysis dataset will be based on the intent-to-treat population. Analysis based on 
the per-protocol population will also be conducted as exploratory analysis. Missing data will be 
handled by [CONTACT_870174].   
13.3 Early Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_870131]’s two-stage design, the study will be stopped early for futility if there is 1 
or fewer woman who attain ≥5% weight loss in the first 15 SLOW-BWL women. 
13.4 Analysis Populations 
Intent to treat (ITT) population:   
The ITT population comprises all SLOW-BWL women who receive any Contrave. 
Women who discontinue or are lost to follow-up prior to evaluation of the primary 
endpoint will be considered to have not achieved ≥5% weight loss, and will not be 
replaced. 
Safety population:    
The safety population comprises patients who enroll in the study and participate in BWL 
alone or BWL + Contrave. 
Per-protocol population:   
The per-protocol population comprises all patients who were compliant with the study.

 APPENDIX C:  Weekly weight and symptom survey  
 
During the behavioral intervention, coaches call patients weekly the first 3 months, followed by 
[CONTACT_870178] 4-6. Patients will receive a REDCap survey on a weekly basis with the 
following question:  
1) What is your weight this week? ___________ 
*If patients have not completed this survey before the call with the coach, the coach may enter 
the data that is conveyed verbally.  
 
During months 3-6, ALL study participants will continue with weekly survey, in addition to a 
question about any new symptoms: 
2) During the past [ADDRESS_1214983] you experienced any new symptoms (such as abdominal 
pain, anxiety, constipation, diarrhea, dizziness, dry mouth, fatigue, gastroenteritis, 
headache, hot flush, insomnia, nausea, tremor, vomiting etc.)? 
__________________________________________________________________ 
*If patients have not completed this survey before the call with the coach, the coach may enter

 APPENDIX F: Score Interpretation  
NOTE:  Please see below an example of the information to be provided to the participant upon 
completion of the questionnaires. This information will be also available to the providers to 
discuss with participants during their clinic visit.  
The reports produced by [CONTACT_870179] 'problems' because 
they represent either particularly poor health, quality of life below average, or significant 
worsening from the last time point, as follows: 
Sleep Disturbance, Physical Function, Anxiety, Depression, Pain Impact, and Fatigue:   
 Higher scores represent more of what is being measured (e.g., higher scores indicate 
better physical function and worse fatigue).   
 A score of 30-70 is considered within the expected range of an average population of 
patients.   
 Highlighted scores are either outside of that range (less than 30 for physical function; 
greater than 70 for all others) or are a significant change from previous answers.   
Sexual Function: 
 Higher scores indicate more problems with sexual function. 
 A score of less than 40 is considered to be within the expected range of an average 
population of patients.   
 Highlighted scores are above that average range (greater than 40) or a significant increase 
from previous answers. 
Endocrine Symptoms:  
 Higher scores indicate better quality of life.  
 A score of 41.3 - 76 is considered to be within the expected range for an average 
population of women.   
 Highlighted scores are below that average range (less than 41.3) or a significant decrease 
from previous answers.   
 
Godin Leisure-Time Exercise questionnaire 
 For the first question, weekly frequencies of strenuous, moderate, and light activities are 
multiplied by [CONTACT_269615], five, and three, respectively.  
 Total weekly leisure activity is calculated in arbitrary units by [CONTACT_870180], as shown in the following formula: Weekly leisure activity score = 
(9  Strenuous) + (5  Moderate) + (3  Light).  
 For example: Strenuous = 3 times/wk. Moderate = 6 times/wk, and Light = 14 times/wk. 
Then, the total leisure activity score = (9  3) + (5  6) + (3  14) = 27 + 30 + 42 = 99.  
 Godin scale score of ≥24 is active, 14-23 is moderately active, and <[ADDRESS_1215003] Cancer Survivors Study  
Protocol Chair: Jennifer Sheng, M.D. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Version 14: Page [ADDRESS_1215004], and Fatigue:   
 Surveys were validated in the general population.   
 All of these domains are mapped to a mean score of 50, with a standard deviation of 10.   
 Highlighted scores represent a score more than [ADDRESS_1215005] deviations from the mean (20 
points) or a worsening of at least half a standard deviation (5 points).   
Sexual Function:  
 This survey was validated in patients with major medical problems with and without 
depression, and patients without medical problems but with depression.   
 For this population, the mean sexual problem scores ranged from 24.48 – 43.5, with a 
standard deviation of 32.  
 Highlighted scores represent a score that is worse than the average scores among an ill 
population (40 points) or a worsening of at least half a standard deviation (16 points).  
 
Endocrine Symptoms:  
 This survey was validated in female breast cancer patients undergoing a variety of 
hormone therapi[INVESTIGATOR_870140].   
 This survey is mapped to a mean score of 59.7, which is the total group mean from the 
validated population, with a standard deviation of 9.2.   
 Highlighted scores represent a score that is two standard deviations away from the mean 
(41.3 points) or a worsening of at least half a standard deviation (4.6 points).

Evaluate the Therapeutic Equivalence of Permethrin Cream 5% (Encube 
Ethicals) Compared to Elimite™ Cream (permethrin) 5% (Prestium  Pharma, 
Inc.) in the Treatment of Scabies  
Objectives  The objectives of this study are to:  
1. Evaluate the therapeutic equivalence of the Test formulation, Permethrin 
Cream, 5% (Encube Ethicals ) to the marketed product, Elimite™ Cream 
(permethrin) 5% ( Prestium Pharma, Inc.) in patients with scabies.  
2. Compare the safety of Test and Reference treatments in patients  with 
scabies.  
Sponsor  Encube Ethicals  
Study Products  • Test: Permethrin Cream, 5% (Encube Ethicals)  
•  Reference: Elimite™ Cream (permethrin) 5% (Prestium Pharma, Inc.)  
Study products will be supplied in tubes (60  grams).  
Dosage Regimen  Patients will administer a single dose of study product on the day of Visit  1 
(i.e., Day  1). A second application may be required if evidence of scabies 
infestati on is microscopi[INVESTIGATOR_192282] (i.e., living mites, viable mite 
eggs, or mite fecal matter) are present on Visit  2 (Day  14 ± 4). Each patient 
will receive up to two applications . 
Route of Administration  Topi[INVESTIGATOR_192283]  1:1 (Test: Reference)  
Patient Population  Approximately 250 patients, 2 years of age and older with clinically 
documented evidence of active infestation with Sarcoptes scabiei (scabies).  
Study Design  Randomized, double -blind, parallel -group, multiple -site bioequivalence  
study with clinical endpoints  
Study Conduct  Eligible patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of the two 
treatments (Test or Reference) at Visit 1.  Patients will administer a single 
application of study product on the day of Visit  1 (i.e., Day  1). A second 
application may be required if presence of active scabies infestation is 
microscopi[INVESTIGATOR_192282] (i.e., living mites, viable mite eggs, or mite 
fecal matter present) on Visit 2 (Day  14 ± 4). Patients will complete three 
clinic visits as follows: 
• Visit 1 (Day 1): Screening/Baseline

 • Visit 2 (Day 14 ± 4): Interim Visit  
• Visit 3 (Day 28 ± 4): End of Study Or Early Termination 
Final assessments will be carried out at Visit 3 (Day  28 ± 4), which is the 
test-of-cure visit. Therapeutic cure of scabies will be evaluated based on 
microscopic evidence of absence of scabies infestation (i.e., no living mites, 
no viable mite eggs, and n o mite fecal matter), visual evidence of absence of 
new lesions and healing of original lesions, regardless of the presence of 
post-scabetic nodules (i.e., post -scabetic nodules need not be considered as 
new lesions or persistence of old lesions) . 
Inclusi on Criteria  1. Male or non- pregnant, non -lactating female, 2 years of age or older.  
2. If female and of childbearing potential, prepared to abstain from sexual 
intercourse or use a reliable method of contraception during the study 
(e.g., double barrier methods, IUD, oral, transdermal or injected 
hormonal contraceptives). Female patients using hormonal contraceptives 
should have been on the same product/dosing regimen for at least 28 days 
before baseline and should not change this regimen during the study.   
3. Signed informed consent that meets all criteria of current FDA  and ICH  
regulations. For patients who are considered minors in the state the study is being conducted (< [ADDRESS_228363] states) the parent or legal guardian 
should sign the consent form and the chi
ld will be required to sign a 
patient “assent” form, as appropriate. Patients 11- 17 years of age will 
read and sign an IRB -approved assent form and patients 6 -10 years of 
age will provide verbal assent. Patients 2 -5 years of age will be exempt 
from providi ng assent based on the child’s comprehension and cognitive 
skills.  
4. Clinical diagnosis of active scabies by [CONTACT_18451] a burrow and/or 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_192284].  
5. Parasitological confirmation of clinical diagnosis with de monstration 
under light microscope of mites and/or their products (larvae, eggs or 
fecal material).  
6. Symptom score of 2 or 3 on a 4- point rating scale of 0 -3 for nocturnal 
itching/pruritus . 
7. Ability to apply or have study product applied as directed. If patient is a 
child, then parent/guardian will apply study product to him/her. 
Exclusion Criteria  1. Patients who are pregnant, lactating, or planning to become pregnant 
during the study .

Efficacy Endpoint  The primary efficacy endpoint is the proportion of patients in each treatment group 
with Therapeutic Cure (parasitological  cure plus clinical cure) of scabies at the test -
of-cure visit conducted at Day  28 ± 4. A parasitological cure is defined as failure to 
demonstrate microscopi[INVESTIGATOR_192288] (i.e., no living mites, 
no viable mite eggs, and no mite  fecal matter present). A clinical cure is defined as 
visual evidence of absence of new lesions and healing of original lesions, regardless 
the presence of post -scabietic nodules (i.e., post -scabietic nodules need not be 
considered as new lesions or persis tence of old lesions).  
Evaluation  of 
Therapeutic 
Equivalence  Primary Analysis:  
Therapeutic equivalence of the Test product to the Reference product based 
on the primary endpoint will be evaluated in the per -protocol ( PP) population. 
If the 90% confidence interval on the absolute  difference between the 
proportion of patients who are considered a Therapeutic Cure (primary) in the 
Test and Reference groups is contained within the range [ -20%, +20%] then

Supportive Analyses:  
The following supportive analyses will be performed for the primary

Treatment -by-Site Interaction and Pooling of Clinical Sites  
As this is a multiple -site study, the inte raction of treatment -by-site may be 
evaluated for the primary efficacy endpoint in the PP population (for 
equivalence testing). The treatment -by-site interaction will be evaluated by 
[CONTACT_117889] -Day test for homogeneity of the odds ratio at the 5% signific ance 
level ( p < 0.05). A site(s) with a low enrollment rate(s) may be pooled with 
its geographically closest site, so as to avoid bias in the estimation of a 
treatment- by-site interaction effect. The pooling will be done for low 
enrolling sites that accoun t for less than 4- 7% of the total number of patients 
in the PP population at the site with the highest enrolling rate in the PP 
population. If the treatment -by-site interaction term is found to be statistically 
significant ( p < 0.05) for the primary endpoi nt, then the interaction term will 
also be assessed for clinical relevance before pooling the data across sites. 
This will include examination of Therapeutic Cure rates at each site where sample sizes per treatment may be influential in the assessment of t he 
interaction.  
Safety Analysis  Adverse events will be classified using standard Medical Dictionary for 
Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) terminology Version 20.0 or higher and 
summarized by [CONTACT_1570]. Summary tables comparing the type, 
incidence, date  of onset, date of resolution, severity, action taken, outcome 
and Investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_192289]. If sufficient data exist, AE frequencies will be 
compared between treatments using Fisher’s exact test or a similar test.  
Signs and symptoms of scabies will not be considered AEs, unless in the 
Investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], they have increased in frequency and/or severity to 
such an extent that the Investigator/patient considers that it is in the patie nt’s 
best interest to be dropped from continued participation in the study and

Confidential Protocol 71675502  Rev 1  November 3rd, 2017  Encube Ethicals    Page [ADDRESS_228366] will be included in the comparative safety 
analysis.  
Sample Size 
Determination  For the primary endpoint analysis (proportion of patients in the PP popul ation 
who are considered to be a Therapeutic Cure on Day  28 ± 4), sample size is 
estimated for therapeutic equivalence of the Test to the Reference product.  
Based on data from a previous bioequivalence study conducted to support 
approval of the first gener ic product of permethrin cream, 5%, the 
Therapeutic Cure rate (p R) of the Reference product (Elimite™ permethrin 
cream 5%) is expected to be about 88% in the PP population. Assuming that 
the Therapeutic Cure rate for the Test group (pT) is an absolute diff erence of 
5% lower than the Therapeutic Cure rate for the Reference group (i.e.,  pT-
pR = -5%), a sample size of [ADDRESS_228367] 90% power to demonstrate therapeutic 
equivalence (i.e., the 90% confidence interval [Yates’ continuity -corrected]  
on pT-pR  is within a defined equivalence range [ -20% to +20%]).  
To allow for approximately 14% of patients who may drop out f rom the study 
or are otherwise non- evaluable, approximately 250 patients (125 in each 
treatment group) will be randomized, such that  there will be an estimated 214 
patients (107 per group) in the PP population for statistical evaluation of 
therapeutic equivalence.

 8.0 INTRODUCTION  
8.1 Disease Being Treated  
Scabies is an infestation of the skin by [CONTACT_192310] (Sarcoptes scabiei). The microscopic 
scabies mite burrows into the upper layer of the skin where it lives and lays its eggs. The  most 
common si gns and symptoms of scabies are intense itching, skin rash and the presence of tiny 
burrows caused by [CONTACT_192311]. The scabies mite is spread by [CONTACT_67494], prolonged, skin- to-skin contact [CONTACT_192312] d persons.
1,2 
As of 2010, scabies affects approximately 100 million people (1.5% of the world population) and is 
equally common in both sexes. Scabies is found worldwide and affects people of all races and social 
classes. Scabies outbreaks are common in crowded public places, nursing homes, extended- care 
facilities, prisons and child care facilities.1,[ADDRESS_228369] been  eradicated. A more severe form of infection is crusted 
scabies, formerly known as Norwegian scabies, which is often associated with immunosuppression.1,2 
Diagnosis of scabies is made based on clinical symptoms, such as nocturnal  itching and appearance 
and distribution  of the rash. Definitive diagnosis includes the microscopic identification of the mite, 
mite eggs, or mite fecal matter in the skin. This can be done by [CONTACT_192313] a mite or skin scrapi[INVESTIGATOR_192290] (or near a lesion) using the tip of a needle and observing under a

8.2 Availability and Efficacy of Already Approved Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_192291] & Drug Administration (FDA) -approved scabies therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], called scabicides are a vailable only 
by [CONTACT_50246]. Such treatments include topi[INVESTIGATOR_192292] 5% 
(Elimite™), crotamiton lotion/cream 10% (Eurax®, Crotan®) and lindane lotion 1%. Oral anti -
parasitic therapy includes ivermectin (Stromectol®), which is considered effective in combination 
with topi[INVESTIGATOR_8588].1,[ADDRESS_228370] range of pests including lice, ticks, fleas, mites, and 
other arthropods. It acts on the nerve cell membrane to disr upt the sodium channel current by [CONTACT_192314]. Delayed repolarization and paralysis of the pests are 
the consequences of this disturbance.  
Permethrin is considered the drug of choice for the treatment of scabies. It  is safe for use in adults and 
children 2 months and older. One or two applications, about a week apart may be necessary to 
eliminate all mites and eggs on the patient’s body.  1,2 
8.3 Scientific and Statistical Considerations

5% cream has not been determined precisely, data from studies wit h 14C -labeled permethrin and

 absorption studies of the cream applied to patients with moderate to severe scabies indicate it is 2% or 
less of the amount applied. As the systemic absorption of the Reference product, Elimite™ cream 
(permethrin) 5% is extreme ly low  , its relevance to clinical activity is not significant.[ADDRESS_228371] of permethrin cream, 5% indicat ed that the rate of clinical cure for this product and that for

[ADDRESS_228372] of study 71675502  (last patient, last visit occurred on October  30, 2017). 
Therefore, this protocol was revised to accommodate recommendations in that G uidance, as 
appropriate. Key revisions are the following:  
1. Revised definition of the per -protocol (PP) population  to include those patients that are 
treatment failures on Day 14 as Therapeutic F ailures in the final analysis  (see section  11.3.1). 
2. Revised definition of the Safety population (see section 11.3.2). 
3. Removed the secondary efficacy endpoint  (see section 11. 5). 
4. Removed the Yates’ continuity correction for calculation of 90% confidence intervals  on the 
absolute difference between the proportion of patients who are considered a Therapeutic Cure 
in the Test and Reference groups (see section 11.6).  
5. Added three supportive analys es to evaluate different evaluation windows for Visit 2 
(Day  14) and Visit 3 (Day 28) (see section 11.6).  
6. Added descriptive statistics for the number and frequency of re -infestations from Day 14 
(Therapeutic Cure) to Day 28 ( Therapeutic Failure)  in the PP population.  
The Guidance recommends a ± 2- day window for both the Day 14 and Day 28 visits. This protocol 
incorp orates a ± 4 -day window for both visits. The justification for the wider visit window is that  
permethrin cream 5% is expected to cure scabies infesta tion after  a single treatment. That is, if it 
works  by [CONTACT_2006] [ADDRESS_228373] patient  (with scabies infestation  who meets the 
inclusion criteria ) from  each household is considered to be the index or primary patient  of the 
household for evaluation of the primary endpoint, that  other memb ers of the household and close 
contacts are enrolled as secondary patients  (not included in primary endpoint analysis) and evaluated 
for all safety parameters , and that secondary patients  should receive the same study treatment as the

analysis . The justification for this design is that there is no placebo treatment arm in this study; 
therefore, there is minimal chance that household members would exchange  or share  treatments, 
given th at each enrolle d member would receive active treatment.  Because t he risk of treatment 
exchange or sharing within a household is higher  when some members receive active treatment and 
others receive placebo treatment , the Guidance -recommendation that primary and secondary subjects 
within a household all receive the same study treatment  is necessary  for a placebo -controlled study  
but is not necessary for an active -treatment -only study . 
9.0 STUDY OBJECTIVES  
The objectives of this study are to:  
1. Evaluate the therapeutic equivalence of the Test formulation, Permethrin Cream, 5% (Encube 
Ethicals) to the marketed product, Elimite™ Cream (permethrin) 5% (Prestium Pharma, Inc.) in 
patients with scabies.  
2. Compare the safety of Test and Reference treatmen ts in patients  with  scabies.  
10.0 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
10.1 Study Design and Plan Description  
This randomized, double -blind, parallel -design, multiple -site study is designed to evaluate the 
therapeutic efficacy and safety of a generic Permethrin Cream, 5% (Encube Et hicals) compared to the 
FDA Reference Listed Drug (RLD), Elimite™ Cream (permethrin) 5% (Prestium Pharma, Inc.)  in 
patients with scabies.  
Before any study -specific procedures are performed, all patients will read and sign the IRB -approved   
informed consent that meets all criteria of current FDA and International Conference of 
Harmonisation ( ICH) regulations. For patients who are considered minors in the state the study is 
being conducted (< [ADDRESS_228375] states) the parent or legal guardian should sign the consent form 
and the child will be required to sign a patient “assent” form, as appropriate. Patients 11- 17 years of 
age will read and sign an IRB -approved assent form and patients 6- 10 years of age will provide verbal 
assent. Patients 2 -5 years of age  will be exempt from providing assent based on the child’s 
comprehension and cognitive skills .  
Approximately 250 eligible patients, 2 years of age and older with a clinical diagnosis of active 
scabies based on signs and symptoms and confirmation of micro scopic evidence of scabies mites in 
the skin will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio (Test: Reference) to one of the two study products as 
follows:  
• Test: Permethrin Cream, 5% , (Encube Ethicals)  
• Reference: Elimite™ Cream (permethrin) 5% (Prestium Pharma, Inc. *)

Patients will be instructed to self -administer a single dose of study product or, if patient is a child, 
then parent/guardian will apply study product to him/her on Day  1 according to the dosing 
instructions provided. A second application may be required if presence of scabies infestation is microscopi[INVESTIGATOR_192282] (i.e., living mites, viable mite eggs, or mite fecal matter present) at

use of generic permethrin cream and standard hygiene practices ) will not be enrolled in the study .  
During the study, patients will visit the clinical center for a total of three sche duled visits:  
• Visit 1 (Day 1): Screening/Baseline  
• Visit 2 (Day 14 ± 4): Interim Visit  
• Visit 3 (Day 28 ± 4): End of Study or Early Termination 
Final assessments will be carried out at Visit 3 (Day  28 ± 4), which is the test -of-cure visit. The test -
of-cure visit will occur 4 weeks (± 4 days) after the end of the single application treatment on study 
Day 1 or 2 weeks (± 4 days) after the end of a second application, if necessary, on Day 14 ± 4. 
Therapeutic cure of scabies will be evaluated based on microscopic evidence of absence of scabies 
infestation (i.e., no living mites, no viable mite eggs, and no mite fecal matter), visual evidence of 
absence of new lesions , and healing of original lesions , regardless of the presence of post -scabetic 
nodules (i.e., post -scabetic nodules need not be considered as new lesions or persistence of old 
lesions).  The primary statistical analysis of interest  is the proportion of patients in each treatment 
group with Therapeutic Cure (parasitological cure plus clinical cure) of scabies 
10.2 Selection of Study Design

10.3.[ADDRESS_228380]. Eli gible household members and close contacts of the patient will be offered permethrin 
cream (if they are in need of treatment) and will follow the appropriate application and 
decontamination instructions as follows. Patients whose household members are not willing to comply with the standard of care for Scabies management (i.e., use of generic permethrin cream 
and standard hygiene practices ) will not be enrolled in the study. 
Patients will be instructed to thoroughly massage study product into (clean) skin from the head to 
the soles of the feet, including all folds, interdigital space, groin, navel, and external genitalia, as 
well as the skin under nails and jewelry (i.e., rings, watches). Scabies rarely infests the sc alp of 
adults, although the hairline, neck, temple, and forehead may be infested in infants and geriatric 
patients. Usually [ADDRESS_228381] should 
be reapplied if hands are washed after application. Scabies rarely infests the scalp of adults, although the hairline, neck, temple, and forehead may be infested in toddlers and geriatric 
patients. For toddlers, only the following areas on the head should be treated: the scalp, temple, 
and forehead, avoiding the eyes, because transmission of mites may potentially occur during 
breastfeeding.  Clean clothing should be worn after product application. The cream shoul d be

10.7 Adverse Events 
The pat ients will be monitored throughout the study for any AEs. Adverse events will be collected 
through both solicited and unsolicited means and subsequently coded in tabular form using the 
Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities ( MedDRA) (Version 20.0 or higher) AE Dictionary. 
The patients will be encouraged to report signs, symptoms, and any changes in health to the clinic 
staff. Severity of each AE will be determined by [CONTACT_192325]. The Investigator will  judge the relationship of the event to the study treatments. AEs should 
be followed up until they have resolved or stabilized. 
10.7.1  Adverse Event Definitions 
Adverse Event : Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation patient 
administ ered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship 
with treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom or 
disease, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) prod uct, whether or 
not related to this product. This includes events not seen at baseline, or worsened even if present 
at baseline.  
Unexpected Adverse Event : An AE where the nature or severity of is not consistent with the 
applicable product information (e.g., Investigator’s Brochure for an unapproved investigational 
product or package insert/summary of product characteristics for an approved product).  
Adverse Drug Reaction : All noxious and unintended responses to a medical product related to 
any dose should be considered adverse drug reactions. The response to a ‘medical product’ means 
that a causal relationship between a medicinal product and an AE is at least a reasonable 
possibility, i.e., the relationship cannot be ruled out.  
10.7.2  Severity of Adverse Event  
The severity of the AE will be graded by [CONTACT_192326]:  
• MILD: Awareness of symptom but does not interfere with routine activities.  
• MODERATE: Discomfort sufficient to interfere with routine activities.  
• SEVERE: Impo ssible to perform routine activities.

 • Not Related: A causal relationship between the study treatment and the AE is not a 
reasonable possibilit y 
• Related: A causal relationship between the study treatment and the AE is a reasonable 
possibility.  
10.8 Serious Adverse Events 
10.8.1  Definition of a Serious Adverse Event  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose suggests a 
medically significant hazard, including any event that:  
• Results in death: includes all deaths, even those that appear to be completely unrelated to 
study treatment (e.g., car accident where patient is a passenger).  
• Is life -threatening: in the view of the Investigator, the patient is at immediate risk of death 
at the time of the event.  
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity (substantial disruption of one’s ability to conduct normal life). 
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3850].  
• Causes congenital anomaly or birth defect.  
• Is an important medical event that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in 
death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but may jeopardize the patient or may require medical or 
surgical i ntervention to prevent one of the serious outcomes listed above (e.g., intensive 
treatment in an emergency room, convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]). 
Emergency Room visits that require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
other serious outcomes listed above are considered an SAE.

11.0 STATISTICAL METHODS  
11.1 Statistical Plan  
A Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP), detailing the intended statistical analyses of the study data, will be 
prepared as a separate document and finalized before database lock. Any deviation from the original 
SAP will be described and justified in the final report, as appropriate. The procedure for accounting 
for missing, unused and spurious d ata will be included in the SAP.  
All statistical analyses will be performed by [CONTACT_192327] ( SAS®), Version 9.4 or higher. Datasets will be prepared using 
headings from Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium (CDISC) Study Data Tabulation 
Model (SDTM) implementation for human clinical trials and Analysis Dataset Model (ADaM).  
11.2 Determination of Sample Size 
For the primary endpoint analysis (proportion of patients in the PP po pulation who are considered to 
be a Therapeutic Cure on Day  28 ± 4), sample size is estimated for therapeutic equivalence of the 
Test to the Reference product.  
Based on data from a previous bioequivalence study conducted to support approval of the first generic 
product of permethrin cream, 5%, the therapeutic cure rate (p R) of the Reference product (Elimite™ 
permethrin cream 5%) is expected to be about 88% in the PP population. Assuming that the 
Therapeutic Cure rate for the Test group (p T) is an absolute difference of 5% lower than the Reference

 group (i.e., p T-pR = -5%), a sample size of [ADDRESS_228406] 90% power to demonstrate therape utic equivalence (i.e., the 90% confidence interval  
[Yates’ continuity corrected]  on pT-pR is within a defined equivalence range [ -20%, +20%] ). 
To allow for approximately 14% of patients who may drop out from the study or are otherwise non-
evaluable, approximately 250 patients (125 in each treatment group) will be randomized, such that  
there will be an estimated 214 patients (107 per group) in the PP population for statistical evaluation 
of therapeutic equivalence.  
11.3 Study Populations  
11.3.1  Per-Protocol Population  
The PP population will include: 
• Met the inclusion/exclusion criteria as defined in this protocol at Visit 1.  
• Did not take any prohibited medications throughout the study.  
• Did not have any significant deviations from the protocol.  
• Did not develop any concurrent dermatological condition or illness exhibiting symptoms 
similar to scabies, or symptoms that in the Investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_192303].  
• Completed the last study visit (Visit 3) Day 28 ± 4.  
Patients will be included in the PP population as treatment  failure s in the final analysis on Day  28 
(provided they had no significant protocol deviations) if they 1) w ithdrew from the study because 
of lack of efficacy, 2) show therapeutic cure at Day  14 ± 4 but re -infestation at Day  28 ± 4, or 3) 
do not respond to the initial treatment and have new lesions or microscopic confirmation of mites, 
ova, or fecal matter on Da y 14 ±  4. 
11.3.[ADDRESS_228407].  
11.4 Baseline Comparability  
Baseline comparability of all treatment groups will be evaluated separately in the PP and Safety  
populations. The following baseline demographics (determined from their initial study visit) will be 
evaluated:  
• Age (years)  
• Gender (male/female)  
• Ethnicity (Hispanic/non- Hispanic)  
• Race (White, Black/African American, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Island er, Asian, 
American Indian or Alaska Native, Other)

using descriptive statistics (number of observations, median, minimum, maximum, mean and standard 
deviation). Categorical variables will be summarized using frequencies and percentage. Baseline 
treatment comparisons will be presented using Chi -Square or Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) tests 
for the categorical variables, and Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) for the continuous variables.  
All data will be listed by [CONTACT_117912].  
11.5 Efficacy Endpoint  
The primary efficacy endpoint is the proportion of patients in each treatment group with Therapeutic 
Cure (parasitological cure plus clinical cure) of scabies at the test -of-cure visit conducted at 
Day 28 ± 4. A parasitological cure is defined as failure to demonstrate microscopi[INVESTIGATOR_192304] (i.e., no living mites, no viable mite eggs, and no mite fecal matter present). A 
clinical cure is defined as visual evidence of absence of new lesions and healing of original lesions, 
regardless the presence of post -scabietic nodules (i.e., post -scabietic nodules  need not be considered 
as new lesions or persistence of old lesions).  
Patients who do not respond to the initial treatment and have new lesions or microscopic confirmation 
of mites, ova, or fecal matter on Day 14 ±  4 will be treated as treatment failure in the final analysis on 
Day 28.  
11.6 Efficacy Analyses  
Primary Analysis : 
Therapeutic equivalence of the Test product to the Reference product based on the primary endpoint  
will be evaluated in the PP  population. If the 90% confidence interval on the absolute difference 
between the proportion of patients who are considered a Therap eutic Cure (primary) in the Test and 
Reference groups is contained within the range [ -20%, +20%] then therapeutic equivalence of the 
Test product to the Reference product will be considered to have been demonstrated. 
Supportive Analyses:  
The following supportive analyses will be performed for the primary endpoint:  
1. The primary  analysis will be performed  including patients who completed Visit 2 within  
14 ± 2 days and Visit 3 within 28  ± 4 days.  
2. The primary  analysis will be performed including patients who completed Visit 2 within 
14 ± 2 days and Visit 3 between Day 26 and Day 32, inclusive .

 11.7 Treatment -by-Site Interaction and Pooling of Clinical Sites  
As this is a multiple -site study, the interaction of treatment -by-site may be evaluated for the primary 
efficacy endpoint in the PP population (for equivalence testing). The treatment -by-site interaction will 
be ev aluated by [CONTACT_117889] -Day test for homogeneity of the odds ratio at the 5% significance level 
(p < 0.05). A site(s) with a low enrollment rate(s) may be pooled with its geographically closest site, 
so as to avoid bias in the estimation of a treatment -by-site interaction effect. The pooling will be done 
for low enrolling sites that account for less than 4- 7% of the total number of patients in the PP 
population at the site with the highest enrolling rate in the PP population. If the treatment -by-site 
interac tion term is found to be statistically significant ( p < 0.05) for the primary endpoint, then the 
interaction term will also be assessed for clinical relevance before pooling the data across sites. This 
will include examination of Therapeutic Cure rates at each site where sample sizes per treatment may 
be influential in the assessment of the interaction .

 14.0 APPENDICES  
14.1 APPENDIX A: RATING OF SCABIES SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS  
PRURITUS  
At each clinic visit, patients will be asked to rate the severity of pruritus (overall itch intensity and 
effect of itching on nighttime sleep) on the following 4- point scale.  
  0 = none (complete absence of itching)  
 1 = mild (slight itching, no sleep loss)  
 2 = moderate (definitely present, interrupts sleep)  
 3 = severe (marked, intense, c annot sleep)  
LESION COUNT  
At each clinic visit, the lesion  count will be evaluated and rated as follows:  
 < 50 = mild  
 50-100 = moderate  
> 100 = severe

Protocol Version Date: 21Jun2018  1.[ADDRESS_693826] cancers (BTCs) include  malignant intrahepatic and extrahepatic 
cholangiocarcinomas, gallbladder and ampullary cancers. It is e stimated that 11,420 
patients will be diagnosed with BTCs in 2016 in [LOCATION_002].( Siegel, Miller et al. 2016) 
Globally, both the incidence and mortality from BTCs is increasing with much higher 
incidences in a few regions. Most patients with BTCs present with unresectable or 
metastatic disease. Even in patients with resectable disease, the recurrences are frequent. 
The median survival of patients with advanced BTCs is less than 4.5 months. (Glimelius, 
Hoffman et al. 1996; Sharma, Dwary et al. 2010 )  Combination g emcitabine and cisplatin 
has been established as first line standard of care treatment based on  the Advanced 
Biliary Tract Cancer -02 (ABC-02) phase III trial.( Valle, Wasan et al. 2010) 
Unfortunately, the median overall survival (OS) was less than a year in this trial. There is no FDA approved second line option for patients with advanced BTCs. There is a huge 
unmet need to develop novel therapi[INVESTIGATOR_534175].  
 
1.2 FTD/TPI ( TAS -102; trifluridine/tipi[INVESTIGATOR_14965])  
FTD/TPI  (TAS -102; Lonsurf; trifluridine/tipi[INVESTIGATOR_14965]) is a novel oral nucleoside consisting 
of α,α,α-trifluorothymidine (FTD) and 5-chloro-6- (2-iminopyrrolidin -1-yl) methyl-2,4 
(1H,3H)-pyrimidinedione hydrochloride (TPI) at a molar ratio of 1:0·5. The active 
antitumor component of FTD/TPI  [INVESTIGATOR_534176].  
 
Trifluridine, an antineoplastic thymidine -based nucleoside analogue, is described 
chemically as 2’-deoxy-5- (trifluoromethyl) uridine, and has the following structural 
formula: 
 
 Trifluridine has a molecular formula C10H11F3N2O5 and a molecular weight of 296.20. 
Trifluridine is a white crystalline powder, soluble in water, ethanol, 0.01 mol/L hydrochloric acid, 0.01 mol/L sodium hydroxide solution; freely soluble in methanol, 
acetone; sparingly soluble in 2-propanol, acetonitrile; slightly soluble in diethyl ether ; 
and very slightly soluble in isopropyl ether.  
Tipi[INVESTIGATOR_13071], a thymidine phosphorylase inhibitor, is described chemically as 5-chloro-6- [(2-iminopyrrolidin-1- yl)methyl]pyrimidine -2,4- (1H,3H)-dione 
monohydrochloride or 2,4(1H ,3H)-Pyrimidinedion e, 5-chloro-6- [(2-imino -1-

The clinical efficacy and safety of FTD/TPI  [INVESTIGATOR_534177], 
randomized, double- blind, placebo-controlled study (RECOURSE s tudy) conducted in 
patients with previously treated metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC). A total of 800 
patients were randomized 2:1 to receive trifluridine/tipi[INVESTIGATOR_14965] (n = 534) plus best 
supportive care (BSC) or matching placebo (n = 266) plus BSC. Patients received 35 
mg/m2 trifluridine/tipi[INVESTIGATOR_534178] 1 –
5 and 8–12 of each 28- day cycle until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The 
primary efficacy outcome measure was overall survival (OS) and an  additional efficacy 
outcome measure was progression -free survival (PFS).  Patient demographics and 
baseline characteristics were similar between groups. The median  age was 63 years, 61% 
were male,  and 58% and 35% were White and Asian respectively. The RECO URSE 
study met the efficacy endpoints of significant improvement in OS and PFS compared to placebo in patients with refractory mCRC whose disease had progressed after standard  
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  The median OS was 7.1 months with FTD/TPI [INVESTIGATOR_441829] 5.3 months in 
placebo group (Hazard ratio:  0.68; 95% CI: 0.56-0.78). Median PFS was 2 months in 
FTD/TPI [CONTACT_495800] 1.7 months in placebo group (Hazard ratio: 0.48; 95% CI: 0.41-0.57). 
The objective response rate was 1.6%.  Common a dverse events included fatigue, nausea, 
vomiting, diarrhea, anorexia and cytopenias. Table 1 lists the common adverse events 
associated with FTD/TPI .

2014) On retrospective analysis, fluoropyrimidine based treatments have shown to be 
associated with improved surviva l.(Huggett, Passant et al. 2014) However, t here are  only 
limited small prospective studies reported utilizing fluoropyrimidines. Single agent 5-
fluorouracil has yielded response rates of 10-32% with median OS of approximately [ADDRESS_693828] line treatment. (Falkson, MacIntyre et al. 1984; Choi, Choi et al. 2000) 
Addition of other chemotherapy agents including platinum agents and irinotecan are associated with better response rates at the expense of increase toxicities. However, none 
of the combination regimens have consistently demonstrated superiority over single agent 
fluoropyrimidine alone.( Hezel and Zhu 2008) The c ombination of 5- flourouracil and 
irinotecan demonstrated  a response rate of 10% in a study of 30 patients.( Feisthammel, 
Schoppmeyer et al. 2007) Another study evaluating the combination of 5-fluorouracil and cisplatin reported response rates of 24% with median survival of [ADDRESS_693829] 
line setting. (Ducreux, Rougier et al. 1998) Capecitabine and cisplatin combination 
demonstrated median progression free survival ranging from 2.5- 3.7 months  in untreated 
advanced BTCs.( Kim, Chang et al. 2003 ; Hong, Lee et al. 2007) S-1, a combination of 
tegafur (that is converted to 5 -flouorouracil in the liver), 5-chloro-2,4-dihydroxypyridine 
(inhibitor of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase)  and potassium oxonate has also shown 
activity in advanced BTCs as a single agent. (Ueno, Okusaka et al. 2004) These studies 
suggest there may be a role f or fluoropyrimidines in advanced BTCs. 
 
The active antitumor component of FTD/TPI  [INVESTIGATOR_534180].  FTD has also shown to inhibit thymidylate synthase in tumor xenograft models. 
The incorporation into DNA is known to have antitumor effects, because inhibition of 
thymidylate synthase caused by [CONTACT_534201][INVESTIGATOR_534181]'s elimination.  
The mechanism of action of F TD/TPI  [INVESTIGATOR_534182]. (Lenz, Stintzing et al. 2015) Greater inhibition of thymidylate synthase was 
observed with continuos infusion of FTD than twice daily dosing.( Tanaka, Sakamoto et 
al. 2014) In contrast, the level of incorporation into DNA was higher with twice- daily 
oral dosing. Thus, clinically with twice daily dosing schedule of FTD/TPI , incorporation 
into DNA is the primary mechanism of action for antitumor effects.  TPI [CONTACT_832] a potent 
inhibitor of thymidine phosphorylase, which is the enzyme that degrades FTD and helps maintain adequate plasma concentration needed for its activity.  
 The mechanism of FTD/TPI  [INVESTIGATOR_534183].( Emura, 
Nakagawa et al. 2004 ; Emura, Suzuki et al. 2004) The primary mechanism of resistance to 
5-fluorouracil seems to be decrease in activity of orotate phosphoribosyltransferase 
resulting in  decrease in cellular uptake of 5 -fluorouracil in the RNA fraction.( Murakami, 
Kazuno et al. 2000) There is no change in the levels of thymidylate synthase.  FTD  has 
demonstrated activ ity in 5-fluorouracil resistant colorectal and gastric cell lines as

Stintzing et al. 2015 ) Autophagy has also shown to play a role in resistance to 5-
fluorouracil but not to FTD.( Bijnsdorp, Peters et al. 2010) . These  studies  suggest that

1.4 Study Design  
This is the  single arm  phase II trial to assess the eff icacy of FTD/TPI  [INVESTIGATOR_534186], 
refractory BTCs . The primary end point of this study is 16- week progression -free 
survival. If 30% of patients remain progression- free at 16 -weeks, this trial will be 
considered a success warranting bigger trials We will accrue 25 evaluable patients using 
a single stage design.  The total sample size of this study is 28 to account for 3 possible 
non-evaluable subjects.   
 
Patient  will receive FTD/TPI  [INVESTIGATOR_534187] 35 mg/m2 on D ays [ADDRESS_693830] blood samples for determination of cell free DNA and circulating tumor cells at baseline, after 2 cycles and at progression.  
2.0 Goals  
2.1 Primary Goal

modifications should be regarded as guidelines to produce mild- to-moderate, but not 
debilitating, side effects. Under exceptional circumstances, at the investigator dis cretion (in 
consultation with principal investigator) dose modifications or treatment interruption or 
continuation can be considered if it’s considered to be in the best interest of a patient. If 
multiple adverse events are seen, administer dose based on g reatest reduction required for any 
single adverse event observed. Reductions apply to treatment given in the preceding cycle and 
are based on adverse events observed since the prior dose.  The criteria for dose modifications 
of FTD/TPI (TAS -102) for toxicit ies will be considered if an adverse event is at least possibly 
related to FTD/TPI (TAS -102).  
NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) current version 4.0* will be utilized for dose modification unless otherwise specified. Upto three dos e level reductions are

Events that would not typi[INVESTIGATOR_15881], but 
that for a specific protocol are being reported via expedited means in order  to facilitate the 
review of safety data (may be requested by [CONTACT_15927]).  
Unanticipated Adverse Device Event (UADE) 
Any serious adverse effect on health or safety or any life-threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with, a device, if that effect, problem, or death was not previously identified 
in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the investigational plan or application (including 
a supplementary plan or application), or any other unanticipated serious problem associated 
with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects  
10.1 Adverse Event Characteristics  
CTCAE term (AE description) and grade: The descriptions and grading scales found 
in the revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 
4.[ADDRESS_693847] access to a copy of the CTCAE version 4.0. A copy of the CTCAE version 4.0 can be 
downloaded from the CTEP web site: 
(http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic applications/ctc.htm
) 
a. Identify the grade and severity of the event using the CTCAE version 4.0. 
b. Determine whether the event is expected or unexpected (see Section 10.2). 
c. Determine if the adverse event is related to the study intervention (agent, treatment or 
procedure) (see Section 10.3). 
d. Determine whether the event must be reported as an expedited report. If yes, 
determine the timeframe/mechanism (see Section 10.4).  
e. Determine if other reporting is required (see Section 10.5).  
f. Note: All AEs reported via expedited mechanisms must also be reported via the 
routine data reporting mechanisms defined by [CONTACT_760] (see Sections 10.6 and 18.0). 
NOTE: A severe AE is NOT the same as a serious AE, which is defined in Section 10.4.  
10.2 Expected vs. Unexpected Events  
Expected events - are those described within the Section 15.0 of the protocol, the study 
specific consent form, package insert (if applicable), an d/or the investigator brochure. 
Unexpected adverse events or suspected adverse reactions are those not listed in Section 
15.0 of the protocol, the study specific consent form, package insert (if applicable), or in 
the investigator brochure (or are not listed at the specificity or severity that has been 
observed); if an investigator brochure is not required or available, is not consistent with the risk information described in the general investigational plan. 
Unexpected  also refers to adverse events or suspected adverse reactions that are 
mentioned in the investigator brochure as occurring with a class of drugs but have not 
been observed with the drug under investigation. 
An investigational agent/intervention might exacerbate the expected AEs associated with a commercial agent. Therefore, if an expected AE (for the commercial agent) occurs with a 
higher degree of severity or specificity, expedited reporting is required. 
NOTE: *The consent form may contain study specific information  at the discretion of th e 
Principal Investigator; it is possible that this information may NOT be included in the 
protocol or the investigator brochure. Refer to protocol or IB for reporting needs.  
MC1642 21  
Protocol Version Date: 21Jun2018  10.3 Attribution to agent(s) or procedure  
When assessing whether an adverse event (AE) is related to a medical agent(s) medical or 
procedure, the following attribution categories are utilized: 
Definite - The AE is clearly related to the agent(s)/procedure.  
Probable - The AE is likely related to the agent(s)/procedure.  
Possible - The AE may be related to the agent(s)/procedure. 
Unlikely - The AE is doubtfully related to the agent(s)/procedure.  
Unrelated - The AE is clearly NOT related to the agent(s)/procedure.  
10.31 AEs Experienced Utilizing Investigational Agents / Commercial Agent(s)  
NOTE:  When a commercial agent(s) is (are) used on the same treatment arm as 
the investigational agent/intervention (also, investigational drug, biologic, 
cellular product, or other investigational therapy under an IND), the entire 
combination (arm) is then  considered an investigational intervention for 
reporting . 
• An AE that occurs on a combination study must be assessed in accordance with the 
guidelines for investigational  agents/interventions.  
• An AE that occurs prior to administration of the investigational agent/intervention must be assessed as specified in the protocol. In general, only Grade [ADDRESS_693848] possible attribution to the commercial agent require 
an expedited report, unless hospi[INVESTIGATOR_59029]. Refer to Section 10.4 for 
specific AE reporting requirements or exceptions.  
An investigational agent/intervention might exacerbate the expected AEs associated 
with a commercial agent. Therefore, if an expected AE (for the commercial agent) 
occurs with a higher deg ree of severity or specificity, expedited reporting is 
required.  
• An increased incidence of an expected adverse event (AE) is based on the patients treated for this study at their site. A list of known/expected AEs is reported in the package insert or the l iterature, including AEs resulting from a 
drug overdose. 
• Commercial agent expedited reports must be submitted to the FDA via MedWatch 3500A for Health Professionals (complete all three pages of the form).

will review and process the submission to the Mayo Clinic IRB. 
10.52 Death  
Note: A death on study requires both routine and expedited reporting 
regardless of causality, unless as noted below. Attribution to treatment or 
other cause must be provided.  
Any death occurring within [ADDRESS_693850] dose, regardless of attribution to 
an agent/intervention under an IND/IDE requires expedited reporting within 
24-hours.  
Any deat h occurring greater than 30 days with an attribution of possible, 
probable, or definite to an agent/intervention under an IND/IDE requires 
expedited reporting within 24 -hours.  
Reportable categories of Death   
• Death attributable to a CTCAE term.  
• Death Neonatal: A disorder characterized by [CONTACT_31948] 28 days of life.  
• Death NOS: A cessation of life that cannot be attributed to a CTCAE term associated with Grade 5.  
• Sudden death NOS: A sudden (defined as instant or within one hour of the onset of symptoms) or an unobserved cessation of life that cannot be 
attributed to a CTCAE term associated with Grade 5.  
• Death due to progressive disease should be reported as Grade 5 
“Neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (including cysts and 
polyps) – Other (Progressive Disease)” under the system organ class 
(SOC) of the same name. Evidence that the death was a manifestation of 
underlying disease (e.g., radiological changes suggesting tumor growth or progression: clinical deterioration associated with a disease process) 
should be submitted. 
Per NIH OBA Appendix M, should a patient die during the study or study 
follow -up, no matter what the cause, the study doctor will ask  the patient’s 
family for permission to perform an autopsy. If permission is granted, a copy 
of the autopsy report will be sent to the sponsor after all identifying 
information has been removed. An autopsy will help the researchers learn 
MC1642 26  
Protocol Version Date: 21Jun2018  more about the saf ety and efficacy of the treatment. Patients should advise 
their families about their wishes regarding autopsy.  
10.53 Secondary Malignancy 
• A secondary malignancy  is a cancer caused by [CONTACT_437] a previous 
malignancy (e.g., treatment with investigational agent/intervention, radiation 
or chemotherapy). A secondary malignancy is not considered a metastasis of 
the initial neoplasm.  
• All secondary malignancies that occur following treatment with an agent under 
an IND/IDE will be reported. Three options are available to describe the event:  
o Leukemia secondary to oncology chemotherapy (e.g., Acute Myeloctyic Leukemia [AML])  
o Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)  
o Treatment -related secondary malignancy  
• Any malignancy possibly related to cancer treatment (including AML/MDS) 
should also be reported via the routine reporting mechanisms outlined in each 
protocol.  
10.54 Second Malignancy  
A second malignancy is one unrelated to the treatment of a prior malignancy (and is 
NOT a metastasis from the initial malignancy). Second malignancies require ONLY routine reporting unless otherwise specified.

New and/or corrected information regarding the pregnancy obtain ed after 
submitting the initial Pregnancy Form must be submitted by [CONTACT_105944].  
If outcome of the pregnancy is a stillbirth, congenital anomaly/birth defect, or a serious event in the mother, report as an SAE to Taiho Pharmacovigilance or designee.  
If a female subject (or female partner of a male subject) taking investigational product becomes pregnant, the subject taking should notify the Investigator, and 
the pregnant female should be advised to call her healthcare provider 
immediately. The patient should have appropriate follow- up as deemed necessary 
by [CONTACT_140711]. 
NOTE: When submitting Mayo Expedited Adverse Event Report reports for 
“Pregnancy”, “Pregnancy loss”, or “Neonatal loss”, the potential risk of exposure 
of the fetus to the investigational agent(s) or chemotherapy agent(s) should be

treatment or procedure regardless of attribution to the study 
treatment or procedure.  
10.6232 Any death more than 30 days after the patient’s last study 
treatment or procedure that is felt to be at least possibly 
treatment related must also be submitted as a Grade 5 AE, 
with a CTCAE type and attribution assigned. 
10.7 Late Occurring Adverse Events  
Refer to the instructions in the Forms Packet (or electronic data entry screens, as applicable) regarding the submission of late occurring AEs following completio n of the 
Active Monitoring Phase (i.e., compliance with Test Schedule in Section 4.0). 
10.[ADDRESS_693852] becomes aware of the SAE. Comprehensive 
information available at the time of initial reporting (including narrative description, 
medical history and concomitant medications) needs to be provided with careful 
consideration regarding c ausality and serious criteria.  
After the initial SAE notification to Taiho Pharmacovigilance or designee, follow -up 
SAE information will be submitted each time that important follow -up information (e.g., 
diagnosis, outcome, causality assessment, results of specific investigations) becomes 
available.  
All SAEs within  the follow -up window (e.g., within [ADDRESS_693853] dose of study 
drug or until the start of new antitumor therapy, whichever is earlier) established in the 
protocol will be reported to Taiho Pharmacovigilance or designee. 
If serious medical occurrences including deaths outside  the follow -up window 
established by [CONTACT_391904]/she 
believes are related to the administration of the invest igational product, it is the 
investigator’s responsibility to report this occurrence to Taiho Pharmacovigilance or designee.  
10.[ADDRESS_693854] be reported to Taiho Pharmacovigilance or designee within  24 hours . 
1. Death due to disease progression:  
MC1642 29  
Protocol Version Date: 21Jun2018  Disease progression (radiologic or clinical) with the outcome of death 
will not be reported as an SAE. However, relevant signs, symptoms and 
complications of disease progression (radiologic or clinical) must be 
reported as an AE or SAE if it meets the serious criteria. It should be 
indicated that the signs, symptoms and complications are related to 
disease progression.  
2. Death due to other causes:  
Deaths due to reasons other than disease progression must be reported as 
an SAE.  
Death is not an acceptable AE/SAE term. Death is an outcome of an 
SAE.  
When reporting a death, the investigator will be requ ired to identify which of the 
following best describes the category of death :  
• Toxicity for study drugs  
• Radiologic disease progression  
• Clinical disease progression  
• Other causes  
10.82 Disease Progression  
How to report events related to non- fatal disease progression: 
a. Disease progression is not an acceptable AE term. In cases of non -fatal disease 
progression, the relevant signs, symptoms and complications should be reported 
as an AE unless they meet the serious criteria. If any of the signs, symptoms and 
complications meets any of the serious criteria, they should be reported as an 
SAE. In both cases it should be indicated whether the signs, symptoms and complications are related to disease progression.  
b. Radiologic disease progression without relevant signs, symptoms and 
complications will not be reported as an AE or SAE.

one or more administrations). 
• Medication errors with study drugs and concomitant 
medication treatment will not be report ed unless they result in 
an AE.  
• Medication errors with study drugs that result in an overdose will be reported as an AE.  
• Medication errors with study drugs that do not result in an AE should be handled as follows: 
− If it results in the omission of an admin istration, an 
incorrect dose (relative to that specified in this protocol), or the administration of more than the prescribed dose (but does not meet the overdose criteria), it will be identified 
through the recording of study drug accountability data in 
the CRF and does not need to be reported as an AE. 
− If it results in an overdose, incorrect route of 
administration, or administration of an incorrect study 
drug, it will be reported as an AE. 
Based on the above criteria, medication errors that are captured as an AE on the 
CRF should be reported to Taiho Pharmacovigilance or designee within [ADDRESS_693857] becomes aware of its occurrence

An overdose with 
FTD/TPI (TAS -102)  for this clinical trial is defined as:  
• Taking a dose beyond the recommended dose in 1 day or beyond the 
recommended total dos e in each cycle.  
An accidental or intentional overdose with FTD/TPI (TAS -102)  regardless of 
whether it is associated with an AE (even if not fulfilling a seriousness criterion) 
is to be captured as an AE on the CRF and reported to Taiho Pharmacovigilance

Protocol Version Date: 21Jun2018  11.0 Treatment Evaluation 
NOTE: This study uses protocol RECIST v1.1 template dated 2/16/2011. See the footnote for the 
table regarding measureable disease in Section 11.44, as it pertains to data collection and 
analysis.  
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the new international criteria proposed by [CONTACT_459] (RECIST) guidelines (version 1.1 ) (Eisenhauer et al ). Changes in the largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) 
of the tumor lesions and the short axis measurements in the case of lymph nodes are used in the RECIST guideline . 
11.[ADDRESS_693859] diameter can 
be accurately measured as ≥2.[ADDRESS_693860] x-ray, or as ≥1.[ADDRESS_693861] component of a PET/CT, or MRI.  
11.[ADDRESS_693862] diameter is 
≥1.0 cm in diameter as assessed using calipers (e.g. skin nodules) or 
imaging. In the case of skin lesions, documentation by [CONTACT_6775], including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is 
recommended. 
11.213 A malignant lymph node is considered measurable if its short axis is >1.[ADDRESS_693863] scan (CT scan slice thickness 
recommended to be no greater than 5 mm).  
Tumor lesions in a previously irradiated area are considered measurable disease 
under the following conditions:  
a) New lesion that has developed after radiation is completed 
b) Definite increase in the size of the previously irradiated lesion.  
11.22 Non-Measurable Disease  
11.221  All other lesions (or sites of disease ) are considered non- measurable 
disease, including pathological nodes (those with a short axis ≥1.0 to 
<1.5 cm). Bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/ 
pericardial effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonis, inflammatory breast 
disease, and ab dominal masses (not followed by [CONTACT_462]), are 
considered as non- measurable as well.  
Note: ‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as measurable lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability described above. 
Howev er, if non- cystic lesions are present in the same patient, these are preferred 
for selection as target lesions. In addition, lymph nodes that have a short axis <1.0 cm are considered non- pathological (i.e., normal) and should not be 
recorded or followed.  
  
MC1642 32  
Protocol Version Date: 21Jun2018  11.3 Guidelines for Evaluation of Measurable Disease  
11.31 Measurement Methods:  
• All measurements should be recorded in metric notation (i.e., decimal 
fractions of centimeters) using a ruler or calipers.  
• The same method of assessment and the same techniqu e must be used to 
characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow- up. For patients having only lesions measuring at least [ADDRESS_693864]-treatment tumor 
assessments.  
• Imaging -based evaluation is preferred to evaluation by [CONTACT_31952] a treatment.   
11.32 Acceptable Modalities for Measurable Disease:  
Conventional CT and MRI: This guideline has defined measurability of lesions 
on CT scan based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is [ADDRESS_693865] slice thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for a 
measurable lesion should be twice the slice thickness.  
• As with CT, if an MRI is performed, the technical specifications of the scanning sequences used should be optimized for the evaluation of the type and site of disease. The lesions should be measured on the same pulse 
sequence. Ideally, the same type of scanner should be used and the image 
acquisition protocol should be followed as closely as possible to prior scans. 
Body scans should be performed with breath-hold scanning techniques, if 
possible. 
• PET-CT: If the site can document that the CT performed as part of a PET -CT 
is of identical diagnostic quality to a diagnostic CT (with IV and oral contrast), then the CT portion of the PET- CT can be used for RECIST 
measurements and can be used interchangeably with conventional CT in 
accurately measuring cancer lesions over time.  
• Chest X -ray: Lesions on chest x -ray are acceptable as measurable lesions 
when they are clearly defined and surrounded by [CONTACT_6776]. However, CT scans are preferable.  
• Physical Examination: For superficial non -nodal lesions, physical 
examination is acceptable, but imaging is preferable, if both can be done. In 
the case of skin lesions, documentation by [CONTACT_6775], including a 
ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended.  
• FDG -PET: FDG -PET scannin g is allowed to complement CT scanning in 
assessment of progressive disease [PD] and particularly possible 'new' disease. A ‘positive’ FDG -PET scanned lesion is defined as one which is 
FDG avid with an update greater than twice that of the surrounding tiss ue on 
the attenuation corrected image; otherwise, an FDG- PET scanned lesion is 
considered ‘negative.’ New lesions on the basis of FDG- PET imaging can be 
identified according to the following algorithm: 
a. Negative FDG -PET at baseline with a positive FDG -PET at follow-up is 
a sign of PD based on a new lesion. 
b. No FDG -PET at baseline and a positive FDG -PET at follow -up:  
MC1642 33  
Protocol Version Date: 21Jun2018  i. If the positive FDG- PET at follow -up corresponds to a new site of 
disease confirmed by [CONTACT_4654], this is PD.  
ii. If the positive FDG- PET at follow- up is not confirmed as a new site 
of disease on CT at the same evaluation, additional follow -up CT 
scans (i.e., additional follow- up scans at least 4 weeks later) are 
needed to determine if there is truly progression occurring at that 
site. In this situation, the date of PD will be the date of the initial 
abnormal PDG- PET scan.  
iii If the positive FDG- PET at follow -up corresponds to a pre -existing 
site of disease on CT that is not progressing on the basis of the anatomic images, it is not classified  as PD.  
11.33 Measurement at Follow -up Evaluation:  
A subsequent scan must be obtained 8 weeks following initial documentation of 
an objective status of either complete response (CR) or partial response (PR).  
In the case of stable disease (SD), follow -up measurements must have met the 
SD criteria at least once after study entry at a minimum interval of 8 weeks 
(see Section 11.44).  
The cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that appear s 
or worsens during treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria for 
response or stable disease is mandatory to differentiate between response or 
stable disease (an effusion may be a side effect of the treatment) and 
progressive disease.  
• Cytologic and histologic techniques can be used to differentiate between PR 
and CR in rare cases (e.g., residual lesions in tumor types such as germ cell 
tumors, where known residual benign tumors can remain.) 
11.[ADDRESS_693866]  
11.41 Target Lesions & Target  Lymph Nodes 
• Measurable lesions (as defined in Section 11.21) up to a maximum of 5 
lesions representative of all involved organs, should be identified as “Target 
Lesions” and recorded and measured at baseline. These lesions can be non -
nodal or nodal (as defined in 11.21), where no more than 2 lesions are from 
the same organ and no more than 2 malignant nodal lesions are selected.  
Note:  If fewer than 5  target lesions and target lymph nodes are identified (as 
there often will be), there is no reason to perform additional studies beyond those specified in the protocol to discover new lesions.  
• Target lesions and target lymph nodes should be selected on the basis of their 
size, be representative of all involved sites of disease, but in addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements. It may 
be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion (or malignant lymph node) does not lend itself to reproducible measurements in which circumstance the 
next largest lesion (or malignant lym ph node) which can be measured 
reproducibly should be selected.  
• Baseline Sum of Dimensions (BSD): A sum of the longest diameter for all 
target lesions plus the sum of the short axis of all the target lymph nodes will 
be calculated and reported as the baseline sum of dimensions (BSD). The 
MC1642 34  
Protocol Version Date: 21Jun2018  BSD will be used as reference to further characterize any objective tumor 
response in the measurable dimension of the disease.  
• Post-Baseline Sum of the Dimensions (PBSD): A sum of the longest 
diameter for all target lesio ns plus the sum of the short axis of all the target 
lymph nodes will be calculated and reported as the post- baseline sum of 
dimensions (PBSD). If the radiologist is able to provide an actual measure for the target lesion (or target lymph node), that should be recorded, even if it is below 0.5 cm. If the target lesion (or target lymph node) is believed to be 
present and is faintly seen but too small to measure, a default value of 0.[ADDRESS_693867] that the tar get lesion 
or target lymph node has likely disappeared, the measurement should be recorded as 0 cm.  
• The minimum sum of the dimensions (MSD) is the minimum of the BSD and 
the PBSD.  
11.42 Non-Target Lesions & Non -Target Lymph Nodes 
Non-measurable sites of disease (Section 11.22) are classified as non - target 
lesions or non-target lymph nodes and should also be recorded at baseline. These 
lesions and lymph nodes should be followed in accord with 11.433. 
11.[ADDRESS_693868]/MRI/PET-
CT/Chest X -ray/physical examination must be measured on re-
evaluation at evaluation times specified in Section 11.1. Specifically, a 
change in objective status to either a PR or CR cannot be done without 
re-measuring target lesions and target lymph nodes.  
Note: Non-target lesions and non -target lymph nodes should be 
evaluated at each assessment, especially in the case of first response or confirmation of response. In selected circumstances, certain non- target 
organs may be evaluated less frequently. For example, bone scans may need to be repeated only when complete response is identified in target 
disease or when progression in bone is suspected. 
11.432 Evaluation of Target Lesions 
Complete Response (CR):All  of the following must be true: 
a. Disappearance of all target lesions.  
b. Each target lymph node must have reduction in short axis to 
<1.0 cm. 
Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in PBSD (sum of the 
longest diameter for all target lesions plus the su m of the short axis 
of all the target lymph nodes at current evaluation) taking as 
reference the BSD ( see Section 11.41).  
Progression (PD): At least one of the following must be true: 
a. At least one new malignant lesion, which also includes any lymph node th at was normal at baseline (<1.0 cm short axis) and 
increased to ≥1.[ADDRESS_693869] a 20% increase in PBSD (sum of the longest diameter 
for all target lesions plus the sum of the short axis of all the 
target lymph nodes at current evaluation) taking as reference the

14.3 Background and Methodology 
14.31 ctDNA  
Detection of cancer specific mutations from the peripheral blood is an area of active investigation in many  different type of cancers. An accumulating body of 
literature confirms an excellent correlation between mutations found in cancer 
tissues and mutations detected in cfDNA from the same patients. (Kim, Lee et al. 
2015) Changes in cfDNA also correlate well with tumor marker dynamics in serial sampling, suggesting that cfDNA mutant allele fraction changes reflect 
changes in disease burden over time and treatment. Plasma based DNA mutation detection should ther efore provide longitudinal changes in the representative 
genomic landscape of the malignancy in a non -invasive manner, overcoming the 
two major limitations of tissue based DNA mutation analysis (invasiveness and 
limited sampling from a genetically heterogenous tumor).( Diehl, Li et al. 2005 ; 
Diehl, Schmidt et al. 2008; Dawson, Tsui et al. 2013 ) 
[ADDRESS_693874] biologic relevance in epi[INVESTIGATOR_534190]1642 41  
Protocol Version Date: 21Jun2018  increasingly clear, as their relative abundance in the peripheral blood has 
strong correlations with disease related outcomes in early stage and advanced breast cancer. (Cristofanilli, Budd et al. 2004; Hayes, 
Cristofanilli et al. 2006 ; Liu, Shields et al. 2009; Bidard, Peeters et al. 
2014; Liu 2014; Campton, Ramirez et al. 2015)
1-5 Beyond simple 
enumeration, molecular profiling of these cells may provide clinically relevant predictive information to guide the selection of therapy. Deriving detailed molecular signatures for isolated CTCs may also facilitate drug discovery by [CONTACT_132641] g the markers unique to progression, such that 
relapsing patients may be treated for their current molecular disease.  
The RareCyte CTC technology is a comprehensive, reproducible and highly sensitive dual- platform for collecting, identifying and analyzing  
CTCs that does not rely on EpCAM expression for enrichment.
6 The front 
end AccuCyte system is based fundamentally on the density of CTCs, which is within the range of the buffy coat; a unique separation tube and collector device allow for virtually comple te harvesting of the buffy coat 
into a small volume for application to a microscopic slide without cell lysis or wash steps, a potential source of CTC loss. The follow-up CyteFinder system is an automated scanning digital microscope and image analysis syst em that presents high -resolution images of candidate cells 
stained with well- characterized markers before definitive classification as 
a CTC. Importantly, CyteFinder includes an integrated device (CytePi[INVESTIGATOR_188817]™) for CTC retrieval that is mechanically precise, enabling the isolation of DNA derived from single or pooled CTCs advanced genomic analyses including the detection of specific mutations and targeted NGS. The Mayo group has established experience detecting and isolated purified CTCs from breast cancer patients, as well as the capability to design 4 - or 6- marker panels to capture specific phenotypic 
populations of CTCs.  
10 mL whole blood samples will be collected in AccuCyte Blood 
Collection Tubes, which contain the proprietary RareCyte cell preservative. These samples will be shipped immediately at ambient temperature to Mayo Clinic [COMPANY_002]ster and then processed through the RareCyte system within 3 days of collection. CTCs will be captured onto glass slides (8 slides per blood sample) for subsequent immunofluorescent staining, selection, and single cell isolation. The markers used for CTC identification will include DAPI [INVESTIGATOR_391872], cytokeratin, and EpCAM at a minimum. CD45 will be used to distinguish WBCs (CD45 positive) from CTCs (CD45 negative). Pure populations of CTCs will then be isolated and stored for subsequent molecular analyses, as yet to be determined.

15.16 Potential Drug Interactions 
Caution is required when using drugs that are human thymidine kinase 
substrates, e.g., zidovudine. Such drugs, if used concomitantly with FTD/TPI , 
may theoretically compete with the effector of FTD/TPI , i.e., FTD, for 
activation via thymidine kinases. Therefore, when using antiviral drugs that are human thymidine kinase substrates, monitor for possible decreased efficacy of the antiviral agent, and consider switching to an alternative

Protocol Version Date: 21Jun2018  16.0  Statistical Considerations and Methodology  
16.1 Overview  
This protocol will assess the efficacy of FTD/TPI ( TAS -102) in patients with refractory 
cholangiocarcinoma using a single stage phase II study design. This single arm Phase II 
trial will assess the 16 -week progression -free survival rate (by [CONTACT_393] v1.1) associated 
with FTD/TPI (TAS -102) in patients with refractory  cholangiocarcinoma. We will adopt 
a PFS rate of 10% as the null hypothesis and PFS rate of 30% as the alternative hypothesis.  In addition to response, this study will also evaluate the overall response rate 
(ORR), progression- free survival (PFS), overall  survival (OS), and adverse events.  
16.11 Primary Endpoint 
The primary endpoint for this study is 16- week progression -free survival 
associated with FTD/TPI ( TAS -102) in patients with refractory 
cholangiocarcinoma.  
 
16.2 Statistical Design:  
16.[ADDRESS_693878] success proportion where the proposed treatment regimen would be considered ineffective in this population is 10%, and the smallest success 
proportion that would warrant subsequent studies with the proposed regimen in 
this patient populat ion is 30%. The following 
single stage design uses [ADDRESS_693879] 10%. If 5 or fewer successes are observed in the 25 
evaluable patients, we will consider th is regimen ineffective in this patient 
population. If 6 or more successes are observed in the 25 evaluable patients, we 
may recommend further testing of this regimen in subsequent studies in this 
population.  
NOTE: We consider a success to be alive and prog ression -free by [ADDRESS_693880] -
registration  (i.e. stable disease, partial response, or complete response). 
16.22 Sample Size:  
The single  stage study design to be utilized is fully described in Section 16.21. A 
maximum of [ADDRESS_693881] ributed, the significance 
level is 0.05 and the probability of declaring that this regimen warrants further 
studies (i.e. statistical power) under various success proportions and the 
MC1642 46  
Protocol Version Date: 21Jun2018  probability of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_391886] a function 
of the true success proportion as shown in the following table. 
If the true success proportion is . . .  0.1 0.15 0.2 0.25 0.30 
then the probability of declaring that the regimen 
warrants further studies is . .  0.033  0.160  0.383  0.622  0.807  
16.25 O ther Considerations  
Adverse events, quality/duration of response, and patterns of treatment failure observed in this study, as well as scientific discoveries or changes in standard 
care will be taken into account in any decision to terminate the stu dy. 
16.3 Analysis Plan  
The analysis for this trial will commence at planned time points (see 16.2) and at 
the time the patients have become evaluable for the primary endpoint. Such a 
decision will be made by [CONTACT_31957], in accord with CCS 
Standard Operating Procedures, availability of data for secondary endpoints (eg, 
laboratory correlates), and the level of data maturity. It is anticipated that the 
earliest date in which the results will be made available via manuscript, abstract, 
or presentation format is when patients have been on study for 16 weeks (i.e. 
received second scan).  
16.31 Primary Endpoint 
16.311 Definition: The primary endpoint of this trial is the progression -free 
survival  rate. This is defined as the proportion of evaluable patients 
who are progression- free (stable disease, partial response, complete 
response) at [ADDRESS_693882] begun treatment will be 
consi dered evaluable.  
16.312 Estimation: The proportion of successes will be estimated by [CONTACT_437426]. 
Confidence intervals for the true success proportion will be calculated 
according to the approa ch of Clopper and Pearson. 
16.316 Over Accrual: If more than the target number of patients are accrued, 
the additional patients will not be used to evaluate the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_534195]; however, they will be included 
in final point estimates and confidence in tervals as though they were 
accrued in the final stage. 
16.32 Secondary Endpoints  
The following endpoints will be evaluated: overall response rate, progression- free 
survival, overall survival, and adverse events.   
16.321 Overall Response Rate (ORR): Over all response rate is defined as the 
proportion of patients who experience either a partial response or 
complete response by [CONTACT_534208]. ORR will be reported descriptively and a 95% confidence interval will be reported.  
16.322 Progression- Free Sur vival:  Progression -free survival is defined as the 
time from study entry to the first of either disease progression or death 
from any cause, where disease progression will be determined based on 
MC1642 47  
Protocol Version Date: 21Jun2018  RECIST 1.1 criteria.  PFS will be estimated using the Kaplan -Meier 
method. The median PFS and 95% confidence interval will be 
reported. Patients will be censored at the last disease assessment date.  
16.323 Overall Survival (OS): Overall survival is defined as the time from study entry to death from any cause. OS wi ll be estimated using the 
Kaplan -Meier method. The median OS and 95% confidence interval 
will be reported. Patients will be censored at the date patient was last known to be alive. 
16.324 Adverse events: The maximum grade for each type of adverse event by 
[CONTACT_534209] 4.0. We will also closely monitor adverse events 
throughout 
the study.  
16.[ADDRESS_693883] efficacy endpoints. 
16.4 Data & Safety Monitoring:  
16.[ADDRESS_693884] udy chair(s) and the study statistician will review the study at least twice a 
year to identify accrual, adverse event, and any endpoint problems that might be developi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. The Mayo Clinic Cancer Center (MCCC) Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) is responsi ble for reviewing accrual and safety data for this trial 
at least twice a year, based on reports provided by [CONTACT_31959].  
16.42 Adverse Event Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_534196]. We note that the Adverse Event Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_31921] (1) the study re-opening to accrual or (2) at any time during 
the conduct of the trial and in consideration of newly acquired information 
regarding the adverse event profile of the treatment(s) under investigation. The 
study team may choose to suspend accrual because of unexpected adverse event 
profiles that have not crossed the specified rule below.  
Accrual will  be temporarily suspended to this study if at any time we observe 
events considered at least possibly related to study treatment (i.e. an adverse event with attribute specified as “possible”, “probable”, or “definite”) that satisfy 
either of the following:  
 If [ADDRESS_693885] 10 treated patients (30% or higher after 
first 10 patients) experience at least one grade 4+ adverse event at least 
possibly related to the study treatment 
 If one or more patients in the first 10 treated patients (20% or higher after first 10 patients) experience a g rade [ADDRESS_693886] possibly 
related to the study treatment 
MC1642 48  
Protocol Version Date: 21Jun2018  We note that we will review Grade 4 and 5 adverse events deemed “unrelated” or 
“unlikely to be related”, to verify their attribution and to monitor the emergence 
of a previously unrecognized treatment -related adverse event.

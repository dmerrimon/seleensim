Title: The Implementation O f A Community H ealth -focused Intervention U sing Combined 
Aerobic and R esistance Training Protocols In A Group Setting   
 
1. Research Design/Methods  
a. The purpose of this project is to provide an intervention focused on a combination of aerobic and resistance training exercise for adults  residing in Somerset County, 
Maryland .  Through a pre- determined, structured exercise program, participants will 
engage in physical activity sessions for [ADDRESS_401421] surrounding counties (CHNA, 2019).  Currently, Somerset County residents only have access to fitness classes, offered twice a week, which take place in a classroom  at Somerset 
Technical High School.  The class is offered through Somerset County Recreation, Parks, and Tourism and interested participants pay a fee to join.  However, this project offers participa nts pre and post assessments and  monitored aerobic and resistance training 
sessions with a primary outcome of improving body weight, body composition and/or measures of fitness .        
 
2. Subject Selection  
a. The subjects are adults , [ADDRESS_401422] as the intervention is 
open to adults, 18 years of age or older, in Somerset County. 
b. Flyers will be posted around Somerset County.  Somerset County Parks & Recreation will be contact[CONTACT_325070] a flyer.  The flyer  is attached.  
c. Subjects will be recruited from Somerset County, Maryland.  This is a requirement for the funding that was received for the project.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_325028]. 
d. Somerset County Health Department will assist in advertising for the project.  Subjects are not being selected  based on any specific characteristic(s).  Any interested adult in  
Somerset County can participate.  The project is limited to [ADDRESS_401423] will be advertised through Somerset County Health Department and the surrounding businesses and organizations.  All interested adults that reside in Somerset County are welcome to participate if space is still available .   
 
3. Procedures  
a. Participants will be asked to participate in  a health screening  and preliminary fitness tests  
after the informed consent has been signed and returned .  Participants will be asked to 
respond with a yes or no to the following questions as a preparticipation and/or health 
screening tool.    1. Do you participate in regular exercise?  
2. Has a physician or other qualified health care provider ever diagnosed you with cardiac, peripheral vascular, ce rebrovascular disease, or Type 1 or 2 diabetes? 
 [ADDRESS_401424] any signs or symptoms suggestive of cardiovascular, renal, or metabolic 
disease including but not limited to: pain/discomfort in the chest, neck, jaw, or arms; shortness of breath at rest or with mild exertion; dizziness during exercise, ankle edema, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814] (awareness of rapid beating of the heart) or tachycardia; or unusual fatigue or shortness of breath with usual activities? 
The American College of Sports Medicine ( ACSM ) screening on a separate attachment 
will show how medical clearance is determined.   Since the ACSM screening is limited in 
some regard, a Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire Plus (PARQ+) will also be used as a precautionary measure prior to participation to gather additional information.  The PARQ+ is located on a separate attachment.  There is a line drawn through specific information related to a condition and/or medication because that information is not needed.  The PARQ+ will be printed for the participants and the “please list” will be blacked out so that participants do not include this information.  The information collected from the PARQ+ is only used to confirm whether or not the participant will need to obtain medical clearance prior to participation in any of  the assessments and 
activities.  The information is also used to determine proper exercise prescription for the intervention based on the participant’s current state of health.  The participant will be asked to sign the PARQ+ and return it to the PI.  The information collected from this will be stored in a sealed envelope that will be kept in a locked cabinet in the PI’s office.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_325029] a key to the cabinet. 
 
An ACSM screening algorithm and the PARQ+ will be used to determine if a participant needs medical clearance prior to participation in the preliminary fitness tests which is completed a week before the program begins. The preliminary fitness tests will include the curl up, the pushup, bench press, vertical jump , and the Rockport 1- mile or 1.[ADDRESS_401425] will not be 
used to determine if an individual can or cannot participate.  Participants will complete a Bio-electrical Impendence Analysis (BIA), body weight, and waist circumference 
measurements before and after the study .  The BIA will be used to determine percent 
body fat, skeletal  muscle, and body mass index.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_325030].  
The participant will be asked to step on a scale and hold the handle of the BIA device.  The participant will be asked to  hold the BIA device for up to 5 seconds until the device 
completes  the scan.  The weight of the BIA device is approximately 12 ounces.  BIA 
devices are available for the public and may be purchased by [CONTACT_42649].  To measure the participant’s waist circumference, a tape measure will be placed around the participant’s waist on the outside of their shirt.  The participant will be asked to identify where their 
belly button is and the participant will wrap the tape measure around their waist.  One inch below the participant’s belly button is where the participant will be aske d to place 
the tape measure.  The BIA  and waist circumference measurements will be conducted in 
the exercise science lab located in the Department of Kinesiology in Hytche Athletic Complex on UMES campus.     These data collected from participants will be recorded and stored on a password protected university- owned laptop.  The participant’s middle name [CONTACT_325081] 
 [ADDRESS_401426] the option of whether to continue with the study for 12 weeks.  Participants will report to Hytche Athletic Comple x for a 60 -minute combined aerobic and resistance group training  
session  facilitated by [CONTACT_978] .  The session will include pre- exercise stretching, an 
(aerobic) warm -up, weight training, (aerobic) recovery, and a period of post- exercise 
stretching.  The warm -up and recovery will include 10 minutes of steady- state aerobic 
activity on the indoor or outdoor track.  During these periods, walking, jogging, or cardio machines may be used at participant discretion.  Static and /or dynamic stretching of each 
major muscle group will be taught and implemented.  The resistance/weight training session will include 8 -10 different exercises that target major muscle groups (legs, chest, 
and back).  The time and intensity will progress from one set of 10- 15 reps per exercise to 
three sets of 8 -10 reps per exercise.  The intensity follows the American College of 
Sports Medicine guidelines for exercise testing and prescription  and will progress from 
low to moderate intensity  (ACSM, 2021).  Abdominal and low- back exercises will also 
be incorporated throughout the weight training portion to pr omote muscular balance.   
Participants can  ask for an alternative method and/or not to participate in one or all of the 
exercises  after they are demonstrated and explained .   
 
b. The BIA, bodyweight, waist circumference, pushup, curl-up, bench press, and the vertical jump  test will take place in the exercise science lab of the Department of Kinesiology in 
Hytche Athletic Complex on the UMES campus.  Males will complete pushups on their toes without their knees being down while women will complete pushups in the modified version with their knees down.  An Airex cushion will be placed under both males and females as a precautionary measure if they are unable to complete a pushup.  Participants will be given an exercise mat to complete their curl -up on the floor.  For the bench press, 
the participant will lie on a bench that includes a barbell and free -weight plates, if 
applicable.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_325031] .  For the vertical jump test, participants will stand on a mat and jump straight 
up in the air to hit and/or move the rung.  This will be performed on a mat to allow for a softer landing.  The vertec is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_325032] .  The vertec in cludes several mobile rungs.  A standing reach 
height is measured first and then a jump height is measured.  The reach height is measured by [CONTACT_325071].   The jump height is measured by [CONTACT_325072]/touches  when he/she jumps straight up.  The participant will jump 
three separate times with rest in between each.   The participant is able to control when 
he/she wants to stop and therefore, the participant does not have to jump all three times.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_325033].  The aerobic and resistance training activities that are a part of the 
intervention session will take place in  the dance studio in Hytche Athletic Complex.   The 
dance studio will have all equipment related to the session in the room.  Some of the

4. Risks & Anticipated Benefit Analysis  
a. Risks associated with participation in this study  will include low to moderate 
cardiovascular and/or muscular fatigue, also known as delayed onset muscular soreness (DOMS),  associated with a new mode of activity/bodily movements that may or may not 
be a part of the participant’s normal routine.   Aerobic and resistance training will result in 
an increase in heart rate which may be uncomfortable for participants.  Additionally, resistance training may cause an increase in heart rate and blood pressure as a result  of 
low to moderate exertion.   Cardiovascular and/or muscular fatigue and DOMS are normal 
for adults to experience at the start of physical activity.  It is also normal for DOMS to occur with adults who have a history of being physically active.  Risks associated with a vertical jump include knee discomfort.  To minimize knee discomfort, the participant will complete the assessment on an exercise mat which will soften th e impact when landing.  
The participant is also permitted to complete one jump or no jumps at all, if applicable.    
 BIA is free of radiation and there are no known associated risks with this.  The participant, however, may experience emotional discomfort from his/her body weight, body fat, and/or waist being measured.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_325034].  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_325035]/she would rather not know their individual measurements.  Lastly, the participant will be reminded that he/she may withdrawal from the research study at any time.    
 
b. To minimize cardiovascular and muscular fatigue (DOMS)  associated with a new mode 
of activity/bodily movements, participants can withdraw from the activity and/or exercise session at any time.  Also, weeks one and two of the study will only use the participant’s body weight to allow for a gradual adaptation of new activity/bodily movements.  Participants will also be introduced to the new movement before it is introduced as a part of the program.  To minimize discomfort associated with an increase in heart rate, participants will be reminded that they can take rest as needed and that they may also withdraw from the session and/or study whenever they choose.  To minimize the effect that resistance training can have on blood pressure, the National Strength and Conditioning Association (NSCA) recommends aerobic, steady- state activity, such as 
walking proceed resistance training sessi ons.  A 10 -minute  recovery period is a part of 
the 60- minute  training session.  During this time participants will walk  or ride a non-
weight bearing cardio machine.    
 Apparently healthy participants and/or those participants cleared by a physician to participate, still may be terminated by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_325036]’ ratings of 
perceived exertion with an activity is too high.  The Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion Scale is a scale used to monitor intensity during exercise.  This scale has since been updated to the revised category ratio scale, CR10.  The scale originally went  from 6 to 20 
with 6 being no exertion at all and 20 being maximal exertion .  The revised/updated scale 
goes from [ADDRESS_401428] a higher resting heart rate, lower aerobic capacity  and/or exercise tolerance, and higher body fat levels.  
The purpose of this program contradicts some of the changes expected to take place with pregnant women and therefore the risks associated with their participation outweigh the potential benefits.  
 
5. Privacy/Confidentiality  
a. Confidentiality of subjects’ identification and information collected will be maintained on a password -protected laptop  loaned  by [CONTACT_458]  [INVESTIGATOR_325037] .  The laptop is 
kept in locked office.  The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_325038].   The middle name [CONTACT_325082].  The participant’s middle name [CONTACT_325083] a pseudonym.  The key/code for the pseudonym will be kept on the same file that data is being stored on.  The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_325039].   The participant may be given their own results after completion of the 
assessments for personal use.   The principal investigat or will not share individual test 
results with anyone other than with the participant.  Before and after test results will be used for research purposes to determine effectiveness of the intervention however, the middle names of the participants will be removed from the data /file since it will no longer 
be needed.  The key/code will be deleted.   
b. Information collected from the participants will not be shared with other participants.  The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_325040].  If participants would like to know the information being collected from 
6 him/herself, this information will be shared with the participant.  Information collected 
from each participant will be done on an individual basis in the e xercise science lab.   The 
exercise science lab is located in the Department of Kinesiology in Hytche Athletic Complex on UMES campus.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_325041] .  The PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_325042]/she would like a copy.  Each individual session for the collection of measurements and assessments  will be by [CONTACT_325073].   The 
information collected from the participants will be stored on a password protected laptop that only the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_286476].  The participant’s middle name [CONTACT_325084].  Once the intervention ends, the participant’s middle name [CONTACT_325085]/file and numbers will replace the names.    
6. Inf
ormed Consent
a. See attachment.b. Interested participants may call, email, or access the google form through the link
provided by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_325043].  Once theparticipant expresses interest  by [CONTACT_325074] , an individual
appointment will be scheduled to explain the study and the procedures.  The informedconsent , ACSM screening algorithm, PARQ+,  and supplemental informed consents, if
applicable, will be explained to the participant.  The parti cipant will be given time to ask
questions.  If the participant is still interested in participating, he/she will be asked to signthe documents.  At these individual meetings, each participant will be provided a copy ofthe informed consent for him/her to  keep .
c. The 
readability report for the informed consent was over 12th grade with an age of 19 to
20 years old.
7. Research Plan for Collection, Storage, and Analysis of Data
a. Data will be collected using a tape measure and a bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA)
device.  Participants will be asked to complete a fitness test which includes a bench press,vertical jump, pushup, curl up, and either a 1- mile walk or 1.5 run/walk test.  Data
collected is what the participant completes through counting or by [CONTACT_2329] a stopwatch.Participants can choose not to complete some or all of the fitness test.   The PI [INVESTIGATOR_325044].  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_325045] , the National Strength and Conditioning Association and the

e. The data will be kept for three years at the conclusion of the study. 
f. After the three- year period, the file will be deleted from the computer and the deleted 
folder will be emptied.  
 
8. Conflict of Interest a. Potential conflict of interest includes receiving a grant from Somerset County Health Department (SCHD) for the development and implementation of a health intervention 
program for adults in Somerset County.  This research effort and collection of data is not a condition of the funding received.  This project may be carried out without intentions of a publication and/or presentation however, it has the potential to contribute to a body of knowledge on community health interventions and how they may be implemented.  Additionally, results obtained from this project will be useful in applying for additional funding opportunities that will benefit the surrounding community.  A narrative will be 
shared with SCHD at t he completion of the project however, no raw data will be shared.  
The narrative will include results from the data analysis.  The funding covers the equipment that will be needed, supplies for the participants, and  salar y.  Equipment will 
include items su ch as the most accurate BIA home device, medicine/physio balls, 
exercise mats, stretching bands, and dumbbells.  Supplies will include items such as hand towels, water, sanitizing wipes, and post-session snacks.  Salary will be given to the PI  
[INVESTIGATOR_325049].  This conflict will not affect the level of risk to the study participants  and will be disclosed in the informed consent.  
Additionally, disclosure of this conflict of interest will be included in publications and/or presentations of the study results.    
9. HIPPA Compliance a. This research includes the collection of protected health information.  The participant’s anthropometrics (body weight and waist circumference) and body composition ( BIA) will 
be recorded at the beginning and again at the conclusion of the 12 weeks.  The PI, however, will not be contact[CONTACT_325075].  Participants are allowed to receive a copy of personal measurements and/or assessments to gi ve to their 
physician if it is requested prior to the conclusion of the study.  Pseudonyms will be replaced with numbers therefore it will be impossible to determine a specific individual’s results at the conclusion of the study.  The health screening will  be an interview with the 
potential subject.  The interview includes t hree questions to determine if medical 
clearance is needed prior to participation as a precautionary measure.  The answers to 
 8 these questions will not be shared with anyone.  The questions for the ACSM 
preparticipation screening include:  
1.  Do you participate in regular exercise?  
2.  Has a physician or other qualified health care provider ever diagnosed you with cardiac, peripheral vascular, cerebrovascular disease, or Type 1 or 2 diabetes ? 
3.  Do you have any signs or symptoms suggestive of cardiovascular, renal, or metabolic disease including but not limited to: pain/discomfort in the chest, neck, jaw, or arms; shortness of breath at rest or with mild exertion; dizziness during exercise, ankle edema, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814] (awareness of rapid beating of the heart) or tachycardia; or unusual fatigue or shortness of breath with usual activities? 
The ACSM screening on a separate attachment will show how medical clearance is determined .  Since the ACSM screen ing is limited in some regard, a Physical Activity 
Readiness Questionnaire Plus (PARQ+) will also be used as a precautionary measure prior to participation  to gather additional information.  The PARQ+ is located on a 
separate attachment.  There is a line d rawn through s pecific information related to a 
condition and/or medication because that information is not needed.  The PARQ+ will be printed for the participants and the “please list” will be blacked out so that participants do not include this informatio n.  The information collected from the PARQ+ is only used to 
confirm whether or not the participant will need to obtain medical clearance prior to participation in any of the assessments and activities.  The information is also used to determine proper exercise prescription for the intervention based on the participant’s current state of health.   The participant will be asked to sign the document.  The 
information collected from this will be stored in a sealed envelope that will be kept in a locked cabinet in the PI’s office.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_325029] a key to the cabinet.  
 
b. The responses from the interview will be used to determine if medical clearance is necessary to participate in the study  as a precautionary measure.

 10 Risks  
Participation in this study may involve cardiovascular and/or muscular fatigue and delayed onset 
muscular soreness at the onset.   Participation in aerobic and resistance training will result in an 
increase in heart rate and blood pressure which may be uncomfortable for you.  The increase in 
heart rate and blood pressure is the  result of low to moderate exertion.  The results from t he 
initial assessments may cause emotional discomfort due to increased awareness of your current physical state.  A vertical jump, which is a part of the assessments may cause knee pain and/or discomfort.  To minimize pain and/or discomfort that may be ass ociated with a vertical jump, 
you w ould complete the jump on a cushioned exercise mat.  You may also choose not to jump at 
all.  Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis ( BIA) is free of radiation and will be used to determine 
body composition and body mass index.  There are no known associated risks with BIA . 
 Freedom to Withdraw & Ask Questions  
I understand that I can ask questions at any time during my participation and that I can withdraw from the study at any time without penalty.  I also understand that I can take rest as needed and it will not affect my participation in the study.  
 Benefits  
Expected benefits are individualized and may include improved weight maintenance, body composition, and/or health -related physical fitness  levels with consistency .  You may receive a 
copy of pre and post assessment results for personal use.  You  can also expect to learn proper 
form and technique with flexibility, calisthenics, and resistance training exercises.  You  may also 
expect to gain knowledge about how to continue being physically active despi[INVESTIGATOR_325052].  This study will also contribute to existing research on health-focused community-health intervention programs in rural areas.   Conflict of Interest  
A potential conflict of interest includes the PI [CONTACT_26777] a grant from Somerset County Health Department for the development and implementation of a health intervention program for adults in Somerset County.  This research effort and collection of data is not a condition of the funding received.  The funding covers the equipment, supplies, and salar y. 
 Where Medical Care is Available In the event of injury resulting from participation in this study, I understand that immediate medical treatment is available nearby [CONTACT_325076].  However, I understand that the University of Maryland Eastern Shore does not provide any medical or hospi [INVESTIGATOR_325053] a result of participation in this research study except as required by [CONTACT_2371].

 From:  LaShawn Nastvogel, Principal Investigator  
“The Implementation Of  A Community Health -focused Intervention Using Combined 
Aerobic and Resistance Training Protocols In A Group Setting”  
 Date:  February 21, [ADDRESS_401434]: Amendment to IRB Protocol #[ADDRESS_401435] week of 
April.  The principal investigator  (PI), myself, will o perate the bod pod.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_325054] 2 -
hour training session with the representative from C OSMED , the Bod Pod manufacturer.   The 
Bod Pod is in the new School of Pharmacy and Health Professions building in room 3114, on the campus of University of Mary land Eastern Shore , registered to the department of kinesiology 
room. The Bod Pod is a large egg -shaped device that uses air displacement to calculate body 
density  (body mass/volume) .  The device predicts  body fat percent and fat free mass from 
various bod y density equations depending on the subject’s race or ethnicity , age, gender, and 
predicted thoracic gas volume .  The thoracic gas volume may be  predicted and determined by 
[CONTACT_8121], or it may be completed manually.  This protocol will have the Bod Pod device predict and determine thoracic gas volume while the subject is sitting inside  the Bod Pod .   
 
To increase the accuracy of the Bod Pod, subjects  must wear tight -fitted clothing  such as 
spandex/tights or single -layer compression shorts  and a sports br a or camisole for females.  The 
subject’s hair is also secured under a tight -fitted cap supplied by [CONTACT_325078] .  
The department will supply each participant their own plastic shower cap to put between their hair and the required tight- fitted cap that comes with the Bod Pod.   Jewelry is not allowed to be 
worn and cell phones cannot be taken inside the chamber.  Socks may not be worn either.  The 
subject’s body weight is measured by a scale that is calibrated for use with the Bod Pod.  The 
subject will be asked to stand on the scale and then step off the scale once body weight has been determined.  The body weight will automatically be loaded to the software program on 
the connected computer .  The software program is called Omnia which is wh ere all the 
information collected will be stored.  The computer that includes this software program is 
username [CONTACT_325086].  Five individuals, including myself, know the username [CONTACT_325087].  The individuals who know the log 
in information work in the department of kinesiology.   The computer is attached to the Bod Pod  
and therefore,  it cannot be removed from the room.   The room is locked at all times.  The 
administrative  assistant in the office of the dean and, potentially, the campus police are the 
only individuals who have access to the room.  Neither know the username [CONTACT_325088].   
 
After steppi[INVESTIGATOR_325055], the subject would then be asked to ste p in and sit in the Bod Pod  
chamber which includes a large glass window for the participant to look out of.  The subject will 
be instructed to sit and remain still as possible while the analysis is taking place.  The Bod Pod 
door will be closed  and opened following on -screen prompts.  The door will be opened twice in 
timed intervals while the subject remains seated  and still as possible .  The door opening and 
closing allows the Bod Pod device to calculate consistent readings in terms of the air that has been displaced by [CONTACT_325079].   The subject will be told that the 
entire process takes about three minutes , if there are no interruptions or errors with the device 
causing a repeat of the steps,  including all the intervals with the door opening and closing.  
Once the on -screen prompt says the analysis is complete, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_325056].  The results will then be shared with the subject.  The results may also  be printed out for the subject and the PI [INVESTIGATOR_325057] a copy.  
Individual subjec t data from the analysis will be identified on the software program as colors.  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_325058] a key for these colors.  The key will identify which color goes with which

Contra indications associated with the addition of this body composition device include 
claustrophobia.  In addition to this, subjects may be self- conscience or uncomfortable with 
wearing tight -fitted, spandex shorts and a sports bra or camisole.  Other risks include emotional 
discomfort as a result of seeing the analysis resul ts related to their body composition.  To 
minimize risk associated with claustrophobia, subjects will be allowed to complete a practice 
analysis of which they will be allowed to remain fully dressed.  If during or after the practice analysis, the subject c hooses not to complete the Bod Pod assessment, the subject is free to 
leave the room  but may continue with the intervention without this assessment.   If after the 
practice analysis the subject desires to run through the real analysis but then midway throug h 
decides they do not want to, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_325060] ‘abort’ button to stop the analysis to allow the subject to come out of the chamber.  On the inside of the chamber, the subject also has the ability to stop the test as well.  The subject would be informe d that they may press the ‘blue’ 
button which is on the chamber seat.  The chamber is not locked however the PI [INVESTIGATOR_325061].  To minimize the discomfort with the required attire, a large sheet will be placed over the 
room’s front window.  In additio n, the subject may choose not to complete the Bod Pod 
analysis at all.  The accuracy of the analysis requires tight -fitted clothing such as spandex and 
this will be explained during the (updated) informed consent process.  Lastly, to minimize 
emotional dis comfort associated with seeing the results from the analysis, the subject will 
receive positive reinforcement  and encouragement as having made it to the 8 -week and/or [ADDRESS_401436].  As a result, all the subjects will be 
tested on a non- intervention (exercise) session day of their choice.  Subjects may be hungry 
since they would not have eaten for two hours and therefore, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_325058] a supply of snacks  
in the room for the subject after the assessment.  Snacks will include the normal post -
interven tion snacks that the subjects are already familiar with.  These snacks include dried fruit, 
nuts, and protein bars.   
 Since jewelry cannot be worn, the subject will be asked to place their jewelry in a safe place with the other belongings that he/she has brought to the analysis session.  Since the subject may be uncomfortable with this, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_62691] -emphasize that the analysis is about three total 
minutes , if there are no interruptions or errors with the device causing a repeat of the steps , 
and they are  free to put the jewelry back on as soon as the chamber door opens back up at the 
conclusion of the analysis.  Since a cellphone cannot be taken inside the chamber, the participant will be asked to place their cellphone in a safe place and/or in a place th at is 
comfortable for him/her.  When the chamber door opens at the end of the analysis, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_325062].  Socks may also not be worn during the analysis and therefore the PI [INVESTIGATOR_325063] a Clorox wipe while in the presence of the subject.  On the contrary, the subject will be allowed to wear their socks while they are on the body weight scale.   The restriction of jewelry, cellphones, and 
socks may also present risks for the subject that include a lack of comfort related to losing or forgetting something that is valuable.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_325064].  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_325065] a Clorox wipe and dry it with a  paper towel so that the participant can

Benefits associated with the addition of this body composition device have to do with its level 
of accuracy comparable to bioelectrical impedance analysis devices.   Measuring body density is 
used as a criterion standard for assessing body composition .  Underwater weighing  and DEXA 
have since been considered the criterion measure .  However, u se of the Bod Pod reduces the 
challenge s/risk s associated with being submerged in water and /or being exposed to radiation  
(ACSM, 202 1).  The inclusion of the Bod Pod allows the body composition results to be more 
reliable.

Title :  The Implementation Of A Community Health -focused Intervention Using Combined 
Aerobic and Resistance Training Protocols In A Group Setting  Statement of Age of Subject  
I state that I am over [ADDRESS_401437]. LaShawn Nastvogel, principal investigator (PI), at the University of Maryland Eastern Shore in the Department of Kinesiology.  Purpose  
The purpose of this project is to provide a 12-week intervention focused on a combination of aerobic and resistance training exercise for adults residing in Somerset County, Maryland.   
 Procedures  
To participate in this  study, you will need to read and sign this document.  After the signing of 
this document, you will be asked to complete a Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire Plus (PAR -Q+).  An American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) screening algorithm will be u sed 
to determine if medical clearance is needed prior to participation in this study.  If medical clearance is needed to participate, you will be asked to visit your primary care physician for clearance to participate.   
 You will also be asked to complete preliminary fitness tests which will include the curl up, the pushup, bench press, vertical jump, and the Rockport 1- mile or 1.[ADDRESS_401438] circumference, and body composition testing.  These assessments will be completed at week 8 and week 12 of the intervention.  Body composition assessments will include a Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (BIA) device and a Bod Pod.  You will be asked to hold the BIA device which is a few ounces or less and stand in a relaxed position.  The Bod Pod is a large egg- shaped device that uses air displacement to 
calculate body density (body mass/volume).  The device predicts body fat percent and fat free mass from various body density equations depending on your race or  ethnicity, age, gender, and 
predicted thoracic gas volume.  While the Bod Pod analysis is taking place, you will be asked to 
sit in a relaxed position inside of the chamber.  The data collected from these assessments will be 
analyzed without any identifying information.  You will be a part of a 12-week intervention which will include a variety of flexibility, aerobic, and resistance training activities.  Each session will last for [ADDRESS_401439] -protected laptop 
assigned to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_325050].  This information will not be shared with anyone other than with the participant themselves, if asked.  ________________________ (Printed name, date)    ______________________(Signature) 
Results from this study may also be used for scientific purposes however, all pseudonyms used 
will be removed at the conclusion of the intervention and therefore the PI [INVESTIGATOR_325051].    A description of the clinical trial will be available http://clinicaltrials.gov , as required by U.S. 
Law.  This website will not include information that can identify you.  At most, the website will include a summary of the results.  You can search this website at any time.  
 Ris
ks 
Participation in this study may involve cardiovascular and/or muscular fatigue and delayed onset muscular soreness at the onset.  Participation in aerobic and resistance training will result in an increase in heart rate and blood pressure which may be uncomfortable for you.  The increase in heart rate and blood pressure is the result of low to moderate exertion.  The results from the initial assessments may cause emotional discomfort due to increased awa reness of your current 
physical state.  A vertical jump, which is a part of the assessments may cause knee pain and/or discomfort.  To minimize pain and/or discomfort that may be associated with a vertical jump, you would complete the jump on a cushioned exercise mat.  You may also choose not to jump at all.  Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (BIA) is free of radiation and will be used to determine body composition and body mass index.  There are no known associated risks with BIA.  Known contra indications associated with the addition of the Bod Pod device include 
claustrophobia.  In addition to this, you may be self -conscience or uncomfortable with wearing 
tight-fitted, spandex shorts and a sports bra or camisole.  Other risks include emotional discomfort be cause of  seeing the analysis results related to their body composition.  To minimize 
risk associated with claustrophobia, you will be allowed to complete a practice analysis of which 
they will be allowed to remain fully dressed.  If during or after the pra ctice analysis, you choose 
not to complete the Bod Pod assessment, you are free to leave the room but may continue with the intervention without this assessment.  If after the practice analysis you desire to run through 
the real analysis but then midway through decides they do not want to, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_325060] ‘abort’ button to stop the analysis to allow you to come out of the chamber.  On the inside of the 
chamber, you also can  stop the test as wel l.  You will  be informed that you may press the ‘blue’ 
button which is on the chamber seat.  The chamber is not locked however the PI [INVESTIGATOR_325061].  To minimize the discomfort with the required attire, a large sheet will be placed over the room’s fro nt window.  In addition, you may choose not to complete the Bod Pod analysis at all 
however, t he accuracy of the analysis requires tight -fitted clothing such as spandex.  Lastly, to 
minimize emotional discomfort associated with seeing the results from the analysis, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_325066].  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_325067] a motivational tool only.  
 To increase the accuracy of the Bod Pod analysis, you should restrict eating and exercise up to 
two hours before the assessment takes place.  As a result, you will be tested on a non-
intervention (exercise) session day of your choice.  You  may be hungry since you would not 
have eaten for two hours and therefore, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_325058] a supply of snacks in the room for you 
after the assessment.

 The Bod Pod device is free of radiation.  Freedom to Withdraw & As k Questions  
I understand that I can ask questions at any time during my participation and that I can withdraw from the study at any time without penalty.  I also understand that I can take rest as needed and it will not affect my participation in the study . 
 Benefits  
Expected benefits are individualized and may include improved weight maintenance, body composition, and/or health -related physical fitness  levels with consistency.   You may receive a 
copy of pre and post assessment results for personal use.   You can also expect to learn proper form and technique with flexibility, calisthenics, and 
resistance training exercises .  You may also expect to gain knowledge about how to continue 
being physically active despi[INVESTIGATOR_325052].  This  study will also contribute 
to existing research on health- focused community -health intervention programs in rural areas.  
 Benefits associated with the addition of this body composition device have to do with its level of accuracy comparable to bioelectrical impedance analysis devices.  Measuring body density is used as a criterion standard for assessing body composition.  Underwater weighing and DEXA have since been considered the criterion measure.     _______________________ (Printed name, date)  ________________________(Signature) 
However, use of the Bod Pod reduces the challenges/risks associated with being submerged in 
water and/or being exposed to radiation (ACSM, 2021).  The inclusion of the Bod Pod allows the body composition results to be more rel iable.   
 Conflict of Interest  
A potential conflict of interest includes the PI [CONTACT_26777] a grant from Somerset County Health Department for the development and implementation of a health intervention program for adults in Somerset County.  This research effort and collection of data is not a condition of the funding received.  The funding covers the equipment, supplies, and salary.  Where Medical Care is Available In the event of injury resulting from participation in this study, I understand that immediate medical treatment is available nearby [CONTACT_325076].  However, I understand that the University of Maryland Eastern Shore does not provide any medical or hospi [INVESTIGATOR_325053] a result of participation in this research study except as required by [CONTACT_2371].

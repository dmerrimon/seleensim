HMRI Basic Protocol Template v23Mar20231. Study Summary 
Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD) refers to disorders characterized by [CONTACT_621775]-coronary arteries that supply the brain, visceral organs, 
and limbs. PAD is most commonly caused by [CONTACT_621776]. 
Endarterectomy is a surgical intervention intended to address the narrowing or blockage of 
arteries caused by [CONTACT_621777]. Its goal is to enhance blood flow in affected areas and relieve 
associated symptoms. Various types of vascular patches are used during endarterectomies to 
reinforce vessel walls, repair arterial defects, reduce the risk of restenosis, and improve patient 
outcomes. 
Postoperative surveillance, particularly through non-invasive ultrasound imaging, is essential for 
monitoring vascular patches' integrity and identifying potential complications. Ultrasound 
provides high-resolution visualization, enabling clinicians to detect abnormalities such as leaks or 
thrombosis early on. The non-invasive nature of ultrasound minimizes patient discomfort and 
allows for timely intervention, ultimately optimizing patient outcomes following vascular 
procedures.
VASCU-GUARD vascular patches by [CONTACT_621778]. are commonly used in the operating 
room. In November 2022, a package change has been made in the [LOCATION_003]. Previously, each VASCU-
GUARD patch was chemically sterilized and packaged in a jar filled with sterile, non-pyrogenic 
water containing propylene oxide. With the implementation of the new packaging, the patch is 
terminally sterilized via gamma irradiation and comes in a double-pouch system (where the 
contents of the outer pouch are sterile). The inner pouch maintains the bovine pericardium 
patch’s moisture while packaged, and it doesn’t contain any water or solution. 
VASCU-GUARD vascular patches with the new packaging have been available at the Houston 
Methodist Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_621771] 2023. This study is a retrospective chart review, aiming to 
compare the performance of Baxter VASCU-GUARD vascular patches implemented during 
carotid endarterectomies (CEA) prior to January [ADDRESS_827654] will contribute to the scientific knowledge about long-term outcomes associated 
with the use of patch material during endarterectomies.
2. Purpose of the Study / Objectives 
PROTOCOL TITLE: Ultrasound Evaluation for Baxter VASCU-GUARD Vascular Patches 
Post-Endarterectomy and Complications Assessment
Page [ADDRESS_827655] vascular patches in carotid 
endarterectomies (CEA), the study aims to identify VASCU-GUARD patches with old (before 
January 2023) and new (after January 2023) packaging and compare the results of standard-of-
care exams between the two groups.
The objectives of this study include:
Ultrasound evaluation of Baxter VASCU-GUARD vascular patches:
Retrospective review of ultrasound recordings and ultrasound reports at one-month, 3-months, 
6-months and 1-year follow-up after endarterectomy – if available, to evaluate patch patency, 
morphology, integrity, complications, and blood flow dynamics.
Complications assessment:
Analyze complications linked with Baxter Vascular Patches (VASCU-GUARD), including but not 
limited to thrombosis, stroke, dissection, restenosis, infection, fluid collection, pseudoaneurysm 
formation, fraying or irregularities in patch material.
Correlation with Clinical Outcomes:
Recognize correlations between ultrasound findings and clinical outcomes. This correlation will 
complement the understanding of how ultrasound monitoring can predict and influence patient 
prognosis.  
3. Background
Peripheral artery disease (PAD) results in the buildup of plaque in the arteries, leading to a 
disruption of blood flow to the head, organs, and limbs. In the US, it affects approximately 8.[ADDRESS_827656] patch was chemically sterilized and packaged in a jar filled with sterile, non-
pyrogenic water containing propylene oxide. With the new packaging, the patch is terminally

VASCU-GUARD vascular patches with the new packaging have been available at the Houston

such as leaks or thrombosis early on. The non-invasive nature of ultrasound minimizes patient 
discomfort and allows for timely intervention, ultimately optimizing patient outcomes following 
vascular procedures.

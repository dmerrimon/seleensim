Amendment 3.02 (Ger many only) 28 May 2015
Amendment 4 16 May 2016
Amendment 5 08 September 2016
The purpose of this amendment is to:
●Update Section 1.2, Synopsis, Section 5.1, Overall Study Design and Plan:  
Description, and Section [IP_ADDRESS] , Study Procedures, to add a Survival Extended 
Access period to the trial.
Rationale:   [COMPANY_013] feels it is an ethical approach to continue to offer 
venetoclax in the study setting to those subjects who are continuing to derive 
clinical benefit and have not withdrawn consent.  The original study design 
allowed subjects to remain on study drug only up to [ADDRESS_525491] dose.  The Extended Access period will allow subjects to continue 
on venetoclax until disease progression; up to [ADDRESS_525492] dose (12 May 2020); or until a subject chooses to switch to commercial supply.
●Update Section 1.2, Synopsis, to clarify that study objectives, with the 
exception of Safety, will cease to be ev aluated beyond [ADDRESS_525493] dose.
Rationale:   The Survival Extended Access period is intended only to collect 
safety and long-term MRD data for analyses.

●Update Section 5.1, Overall Study Design and Plan:  Description, Post-
Treatment Visits, and Section [IP_ADDRESS] , Study Procedures, Post-Treatment, to 
discontinue post-treatment visits effective 12 May 2017.
Rationale:   As very few subjects entered the Post-Treatment period, there is 
little data to provide any meaningful, Statistical analyses.  Subjects will 
continue to be followed in Survival until disease progression or withdrawal of 
consent.
●Update Table 2 , Excluded and Cautionary Medications/Food Items.
Rationale:   Additional information has been added regarding excluded and 
cautionary medications/food.
●Update Table 4 , Study Activities, to include the activities to be performed 
during the Survival period.
Rationale:   The Survival period was not previously included in the table, so it 
has been updated to include the activities to be performed during the Survival 
Extended Access visits.
●Update Section [IP_ADDRESS] , Study Procedures, Quantitative Minimal Residual 
Disease (MRD) Assessment, to add the collection of blood specimen for MRD PCR every 12 weeks during the Survival Extended Access period for subjects who qualify.
Rationale: [COMPANY_013] would like to obtain additional, long-term MRD data for 
analysis. 
●Update Section 5.4.1 , Discontinuation of Individual Subjects, to allow subjects 
with progressive disease who remain on venetoclax the ability to receive other 
approved treatment agents for CLL in addition to venetoclax.
Rationale:   CLL patients with 17p deletion have limited options for treatment.  
The addition of other approved CLL agents may aid to slow the disease 
progression and extend the life of the subject.
●Update Section 6.0, Adverse Events, to reflect changes made to the [COMPANY_013] 
protocol template.
Rationale: Additional information has been added regarding medical and 
product complaints.
●Update Section 6.1.3 , Relationship to Study Drug.
Venetoclax (ABT-199)
M13-[ADDRESS_525495] 2012-004027-20

Rationale:  Definitions for adverse event causality have been updated to 
provide a more robust description.
●Update Section 6.1.6 , Adverse Event Reporting.
Rationale: Updated to reflect change in [COMPANY_013] medical monitor and to 
remove the Oncology Safety Management phone contact [CONTACT_6227].
●Update Section 7.0, Protocol Deviations.
Rationale: Updated to reflect changes in [COMPANY_013] Program Lead and medical 
monitor.
●Update Section [IP_ADDRESS].7 , Additional Exploratory Efficacy Analyses, and 
Section [IP_ADDRESS] , Additional Exploratory Efficacy Analyses, to confirm that 
MRD-Flow data for exploratory analysis will not be collected during the 
survival extended access portion of the study.
Rationale:   Only safety and MRD-PCR will be assessed during the extended 
access portion of the study.

1.2 Synopsis
[COMPANY_013] Inc. Protocol Number:   M13-982
Name [CONTACT_26323]:   Venetoclax Phase of Development:   2
Name [CONTACT_3261]:  Not available Date of Protocol Synopsis: 28 February 2017
Protocol Title:   A Phase 2 Open-Label Study of the Eff icacy of ABT-199 (GDC-0199) in Subjects with 
Relapsed/Refractory or Previously Untreated Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Harboring the 
17p Deletion
Main Cohort Objectives:
Primary objective:  The primary objective of this cohort is to evaluate the efficacy of venetoclax monotherapy in subjects with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) harboring the 17p deletion.  Efficacy will be measured by [CONTACT_34426] (ORR).
Secondary objectives:   The secondary objectives are to evaluate the complete remission rate (CR), 
partial remission rate (PR), duration of overall response (DOR), progression-free survival (PFS), time to 
progression (TTP), overall survival (OS) and percent of subjects who move on to stem cell transplant.  The safety and tolerability of venetoclax in subjects with relapsed or refractory CLL harboring 17p deletion will also be evaluated.
Safety Expansion Cohort Objectives:
Primary objective:  A safety expansion cohort is being added with the primary objective of evaluating 
the safety of venetoclax in approximately 50 subjects with relapsed/refractory or previously untreated CLL harboring 17p deletion per the updated TLS prophylaxis and management measures.
Secondary objectives:   The secondary objectives are to evaluate ORR, CR rate, PR rate, duration of 
overall response (DOR), progression-free survival (PFS), time to progression (TTP), overall survival 
(OS), and percent of subjects who move on to stem cell transplant.
Exploratory objectives (both main and safety expansion cohorts):   Time to next anti-CLL treatment 
(TTNT), minimal residual disease (MRD) assessed in the peripheral blood and/or bone marrow (BM), 
pharmacokinetics, pharmacogenetics and biomarkers will be evaluated as exploratory objectives.  Health Economic and Patient-Reported Outcome Measures will include the MDASI (measure of subject reported symptoms), the EORTC QLQ-C30 and EORTC QLQ CLL16 (a measure of health related quality of life specific to CLL) and the EQ-5D-5L (measure of general health status) and EQ-5D-VAS.
Note:  All study objectives, with the exception of Safety and MRD analyses, will cease to be evaluated beyond [ADDRESS_525497] dose.
Investigators:   Multicenter
Study Sites:   Approximately 60 research sites globally .
Study Population:   
Main Cohort:  Relapsed or refractory CLL subjects harboring 17p deletion
Safety Expansion Cohort:  Relapsed/refractory or previously untreated CLL subjects harboring 
17p deletion (previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia harboring 17p deletion patients will not be enrolled in [LOCATION_013])
Number of Subjects to be Enrolled:   Approximately 150 (100 subjects in the main cohort and 
50 subjects in the safety expansion cohort)

Methodology:   This is a Phase 2, open label, multicenter, study evaluating the efficacy of venetoclax in 
relapsed/refractory or previously untreated subjects with CLL harboring 17p13 deletion.  The main 
cohort will enroll approximately 100 subjects with relapsed/refractory CLL harboring 17p13 deletion to assess efficacy and safety of venetoclax.  The safety expansion cohort will enroll approximately 50 subjects with relapsed/refractory or previously untreated CLL harboring 17p13 deletion to assess the updated TLS prophylaxis measures.  The detection of 17p13 deletion (17p del) will be determined by [CONTACT_254871]/or by [CONTACT_416951].  Screening must be performed within [ADDRESS_525499] be performed within 35 days prior to study drug administration.  A bone marrow biopsy and aspi[INVESTIGATOR_416888] (within 35 days prior to study drug administration), and again in coordination with CT scans, to confirm complete remission.  Study visits will be conducted on Days 1 and 2 of each week through Week 5, then on Day 1 of every 4 weeks thereafter, beginning with Week 8 (e.g., Weeks 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, etc.) until Week 36, and then Day 1 of every 12 weeks thereafter.

Investigational Product: Venetoclax:  10 mg, 50 mg, and 100 mg tablet
Venetoclax will be administered orally once daily (QD), continuously.  
Each dose of venetoclax should be taken with approximately [ADDRESS_525516]'s first meal of the day.  To mitigate the risk for TLS, a lead-in period will be employed to evaluate a step wise dose escalation.
Dose – Main Cohort: Subjects will be admitted to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_416892]-in period with an initial test dose of [ADDRESS_525517] dose of 50 mg will be administered on Week 1 Day 2 followed by 50 mg venetoclax QD for 5 days (Week 1 Day 3 – Day 7).  If significant findings occur within 24 hours on Week 1 Day 1, the 20 mg dose will be maintained for 1 week prior to dose escalation to 50 mg on Week 2 Day 1 – 7.
After a week at 50 mg, the following dose escalation will proceed with 
weekly dose escalations →100 mg →200 mg →400 mg (or 
additional lead-in steps to designated 400 mg dose), as tolerated.
A lower starting dose and/or modification to the lead-in regimen may 
be implemented for individual subject(s) at particularly high risk for TLS.
Dose – Safety Expansion 
Cohort:Single daily doses QD starting with 20 mg; dose escalations will proceed weekly →50 mg →100 mg →200 mg →400 mg, as 
tolerated.
A lower starting dose and/or modification to the lead-in regimen may 
be implemented for individual subject(s) at particularly high risk for TLS.
Mode of Administration: Oral
Duration of Treatment:   Subjects may continue receiving study drug for up to [ADDRESS_525518] discontinuation.  The anticipated median treatment duration is approximately 24 months or greater.

Survival Assessments:   Survival information will be collected every 3 months (±7 days) for up to 
[ADDRESS_525520] not withdrawn consent.
Richter's Transformation and Second Primary Malignancies Assessment:   Information on Richter's 
Transformation and second primary malignancies will be collected every [ADDRESS_525521] not withdrawn consent.
Survival – Extended Access:   For subjects who continue to derive benefit from venetoclax treatment 
[ADDRESS_525522] enrolled (12 May 2020).
Criteria for Evaluation:Efficacy:
Response will be assessed by [CONTACT_093], based on laboratory values, physical examinations, CT 
scans (or MRI if CT scan is medically contraindicated), and bone marrow examinations, using the 2008 Modified IWCLL NCI-WG Guidelines for Tumor Response.
In addition to being reviewed by [CONTACT_1755]/or site staff, an independent review will be 
performed to assess tumor response and disease progression.  Clinical data and radiographic scans will be interpreted according to [ADDRESS_525523] treatment management will be based on review by [CONTACT_94561]/or site staff.
All measurable disease must be documented at screening by [CONTACT_5292], laboratory testing and 
CT scan (or MRI if CT is medically contraindicated), and bone marrow.
During the study, subjects will be assessed at each visit by a physical examination and laboratory testing.  
Clinical disease assessments will take place at baseline, monthly for the first 9 months and then every 3 months until disease progression, death, discontinuation from the study, or study completion.
Additional radiographic studies will be performed as described below:
A CT scan must be performed to confirm the response no earlier than 8 weeks after a response is 
determined by [CONTACT_316316] (laboratory results and physical exam).  For consistency, the same method of imaging should be performed for a subject t hroughout the study.
For determination of CR, both the CT scan and bone marrow are required to be negative.
A CT scan (or MRI if CT is medically contraindicated), will be also performed in all subjects at 
[ADDRESS_525524] exhibits clinical signs of possible disease progression (i.e., increased or de novo enlargement 
of liver, spleen or lymph nodes on physical examination) without an increase in lymphocytes meeting PD criteria, then additional assessments including contrast enhanced CT scan (or MRI) and/or bone marrow must be performed within 2 weeks to confirm or rule out PD.

Criteria for Evaluation (Continued):
MRD:
MRD for enumeration of CLL cells will be assessed using IWG-CLL recommended methods of flow 
cytometry and/or ASO-PCR. The ERIC panel based flow cytometry will be assessed by [CONTACT_416953].  Specimens (bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_67955]) for MRD analysis should be collected at the same time as the bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_416893]/CRi.  If MRD negativity is achieved in the bone marrow no further MRD analyses are required.  Otherwise, MRD should be assessed at 12-week intervals thereafter (in 
peripheral blood) until MRD negativity is achieved.  Once MRD negativity is achieved and confirmed in 
peripheral blood (e.g., two MRD negative consecutive peripheral blood samples), a bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_416894].
Subjects who meet all criteria for CR/CRi with the exception of a node(s) that is enlarged around
1.5 – [ADDRESS_525526] should be assessed at 12-week intervals thereafter (in peripheral blood) until MRD negativity is achieved.  Once MRD negativity is achieved and confirmed in peripheral blood (e.g., two MRD negative consecutive peripheral blood samples), a bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_416895].
Pharmacokinetic:
Pharmacokinetic samples will be collected for venetoclax at designated time points throughout the study.  
Values for the PK parameters of venetoclax, including the apparent clearance (CL/F) and the apparent volume of distribution (V/F), may be determined using a population PK approach.  Additional parameters may be calculated if useful in the interpretation of the data.
Biomarkers:
Several putative biomarkers of efficacy and response may be evaluated in this st udy with the goal of 
defining the relationship between various disease markers and disease status that may predict the 
subject's response to therapy.  Exploratory research analyses may not be included in the clinical study report.
Pharmacogenetic:
DNA samples may be analyzed for genetic factors contributing to the subject's response to venetoclax.
Safety:Adverse event monitoring, vital signs, physical examination, ECG, and laboratory assessments will be 
evaluated.  Guidelines for the prophylaxis, monitoring and management of TLS are provided.
Statistical Methods:
Main Cohort:
Efficacy:
The following efficacy analyses will be analyzed:  ORR, CR rate, PR rate, duration of overall response, 
progression-free survival, event free survival, time to progression, time to first response, time to 50% reduction in ALC, overall survival and percent of subjects who move on to stem cell transplant.  Additional efficacy analyses will include time to next anti-CLL treatment, rate of minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity status, and Health Economic and Patient Reported Outcome (PRO) measures.

Statistical Methods (Continued):
Safety Expansion Cohort:
Secondary Efficacy:
The following secondary efficacy analyses will be analyzed:  ORR, CR rate, PR rate, duration of overall 
response, progression-free survival, event free survival, time to progression, time to first response, time to 50% reduction in ALC, overall survival, and percent of subjects who move on to stem cell transplant.  Additional efficacy analyses will include time to next anti-CLL treatment, rate of minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity status, and Health Economic and Patient Reported Outcome (PRO) measures.
Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic:
An analysis will be performed using a nonlinear  mixed-effect population modeling approach with 
NONMEM software to describe the disposition of venetoclax, to identify significant covariates and 
explore relationship between pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics by [CONTACT_416954].  Additional analyses may be performed if useful in the interpretation of the data.
Safety:
A safety analysis will be performed for all subjects participating in the study who took at least one dose 
of study drug for each cohort (main and safety expansion).  For the study as a whole, adverse events will be evaluated and summarized.  Laboratory values and vital signs will be explored for trends and summarized.

Venetoclax (ABT-199)
M13-[ADDRESS_525549] identified in follicular lymphoma where the t(14;18) 
chromosomal translocation results in signif icant over-expression of th e protein in B-cells.  
The Bcl-2 family of genes encodes a family of closely related proteins that possess either pro-apoptotic or anti-apoptotic  activity and share up to four Bcl-2 Homology (BH) 
domains.
1-4  Bcl-2 overexpression is a major contributor to the pathogenesis of some types 
of lymphoid malignancies.  Bcl-2 is also overexpressed in acute and chronic leukemias.  Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a ge netic disease where the microRNAs miR15a 
and miR16-1 that negatively regulate the transcription of Bc l-2 are deleted or 
down-regulated, resulting in uncontrolled expression of Bcl-2.

Venetoclax in vitro/in vivo Activity and Preclinical Pharmacokinetic Profile
Venetoclax is a novel, orally available small mo lecule Bcl-2 family protein inhibitor that 
binds with > 500-fold higher affinity (K i< 0.010 nM) to Bcl-2 and with lower affinity to 
other Bcl-2 family proteins Bcl-X L(Ki– 48 nM) and Bcl-w (K i– 245 nM).[ADDRESS_525550] a panel of lymphoma 
and leukemia cells including B-cell follicular lymphomas (FLs), mantle cell lymphomas 
(MCLs), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma s (DLBCLs), and acute myeloid leukemias 
(AMLs).  Venetoclax was especially potent against cell lines expressing high levels of Bcl-2.  Leukemia and lymphoma cell lines bearing the t(14;18) translocation were significantly more sensitive to venetoclax than non-mutated cell lines.

Venetoclax inhibited subcutaneous murine xenograft growth of human tumor cell lines 
derived from acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL).  The drug was also active in a model of disseminated ALL.
The pharmacokinetic profile of venetoclax was evaluated in multiple animal species.  In 
mouse, rat, monkey and dog, the venetoclax pharmacokinetic profile was characterized by [CONTACT_416955].  Half-lives ranged from 2.[ADDRESS_525552] on the oral bioavailability in dog.
Venetoclax has high protein binding to human, rat, dog, and monkey plasma proteins 
(> 99.9%).  In rats, venetoclax was widely distributed into liver, kidneys, spleen, heart, lungs, small intestine, and white fat, but was poorly distributed in testes, brain, muscle, and bone.  Metabolism was the major route of elimination with biliary excretion of the parent drug playing the secondary role in rats.  Venetoclax showed moderate metabolic stability in in vitro hep atic systems across species tested, except for low to moder ate 
stability in dog hepatocytes.
In vivo, venetoclax was metabolized by [CONTACT_097]3A4; it was not a potent inhibitor of 
CYP3A4, CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C19, or CYP2D6 (IC
50> 30 μ M); it did not induce 
CYP3A4 or CYP1A2 at concentrations up to 10 μM.  Venetoclax is a substrate for P-gp and BCRP.  Studies in Oatp1a/b cluster KO mice indicated that venetoclax may be an OATP substrate.  Active uptake of venetoclax or M27 metabolite was not observed in cells overexpressing OATP1B1, OATP1B3 or OCT1.  Venetoclax is a P-gp, BCRP and OATP1B1 inhibitor in vitro.
Venetoclax exhibited potent activity against patient-derived CLL cells treated ex vivo, 
killing these cells with an average concentration required for 50% effect (EC
50) of 
0.006μM (n = 35; note that not all subject samp les are from venetoclax trials).  
Venetoclax was equally potent against the subset of CLL samples bearing the high-risk 17p deletion, with an average EC
50of 0.008μM (n = 5), indicating that venetoclax may 
have a significant utility in treating sub jects with this high-risk disease.

Venetoclax Nonclinical Toxicology
Venetoclax has been assessed in repeated-dose general toxicology studies, and in genetic, 
developmental/reproductive, phototoxicity, and safety pharmacology studies.
The primary toxicities associated with repeat-dose administration of venetoclax were 
effects on the hematologic system (decreased lymphocytes and red blood cell [RBC] mass) in mice, rats and dogs, the male reproductive system (testicular germ cell depletion in dogs) and embryofetal toxicity in mice.   Other noteworthy findings were epi[INVESTIGATOR_416896], both in dogs.
In mice, rats, and dogs, venetoclax produced robust decreases in lymphocytes in the 
peripheral blood (up to 75% in mice, 64% in rats, and 81% in dogs) and in lymphoid 
tissues.  These findings are consistent with the expected pharmacologic effects of venetoclax (a selective Bcl-2 inhibitor).
8  In mice, total lymphocyte counts at 
600 mg/kg/day after 4 weeks of dosing were minimally decreased 21% to 6% relative to concurrent controls at the end of the 4-week recovery period.  In dogs, the recovery of peripheral blood decreases in total lymphocytes and lymphocyte subsets (CD4+ T- cells 
and CD8+ T-cells and [CD21+] mature B cells) was prolonged, requiring up to [ADDRESS_525554] sensitive lymphocyte subtype based on the magnitude of decrease (> 90%) and/or the length of time required for recovery.  Lymphocy te decreases in lymphoid tissues were 
reversible in mice and dogs.  Venetoclax produced dose-related decreases in RBC mass due to decreased cellular hemoglobin in mice and dogs; these effects were adverse at the highest dosages in the 4-week mouse and dog studies and were reversible.  In studies to select carcinogenicity dose levels, RBC mass decreases were also observed in rats and were generally more severe than in mice or dogs.  Venetoclax produced adverse, non-dose related microscopic findings of testicular germ cell depletion in dogs at all doses tested; reversibility was not observed following a 4-week recovery period.  There were no 
testicular effects in mice.  Venetoclax resulted in increased post-implantation loss and decreased fetal body weights in the mouse embryo f etal development study at the highest 
dosage administered (150 mg/kg/day); the no-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL)

M13-[ADDRESS_525555] 2012-004027-20

was defined at the mid dose of 50 mg/kg/day.  In mice and rabbits, venetoclax was not 
teratogenic, and there were no other effects on development or fertility.
Additional noteworthy effects of venetoclax included white hair coat discoloration in dogs 
(occurring after approximately 3 months of dosing in the 9-month study) and minimal to 
mild single cell necrosis in multiple epi[INVESTIGATOR_416897] (e.g., gallbladder and exocrine 
pancreas) in dogs.  None of these effects was considered to be adverse.
There was no evidence of in vitro or in vivo genetic toxicity of venetoclax, and there was 
no evidence of cutaneous phototoxicity of ven etoclax in an in vivo study in Crl:SKH1- hr 
female hairless mice.
Other minor effects of venetoclax were observed in dogs.  (1) At the high dosage of 
150 mg/kg/day in the 4-week study had clinical signs of swelling of the skin on the ears, head (cranial area), and forepaws and/or hindpaws.  Most but not all animals (8 of 10 dogs) were affected, and in [ADDRESS_525556] dose.  The clinical signs were limited to  the 150 mg/kg/dosage, were transient and 
sporadic in occurrence, and were absent duri ng the recovery period.  A mechanistic basis 
for the swelling reactions was not established, but the clinical signs were mild to moderate in severity and reversible, and there were no signs of anaphylaxis.  (2) Dose-related, transient post dose emesis, increased saliv ation, and fecal alterations (unformed or watery 
feces) were observed at dosages of ≥ 5 mg/kg/day.  These clinical signs were present 
throughout the dosing phase, but were not dose- limiting and were not observed in the 
recovery phase.  In the 9-month dog study, non-adverse decreases in mean body weight and body weight gain, associated with decr eases in food consumption, were observed at 
≥2 mg/kg/day.
M27 is a major human metabolite of venetoclax.  Although observed in mice and dogs, M27 is present at much lower levels (0.05- t o 0.09-fold), as compared with steady-state 
levels in humans, and therefore is a disproportionate metabolite.  By [CONTACT_193920], M27 does not generate new alerts for mutagenicity, as compared with the venetoclax parent compound.  M27 shows low in vitro potency (at least 58-fold less than parent) and 
Venetoclax (ABT-199)

produced no evidence of in vitro genotoxicity in Ames and chromosome aberration 
assays.  In a secondary pharmacology r eceptor panel screening study, M27 produced 
significant displacement of control-specific binding at the delta-opi[INVESTIGATOR_9736] (DOP K
i= 0.65 μM); however, when evaluated in a functional assay, agonist or antagonist 
activity was not observed at the DOP receptor up to a maximum concentration of [ADDRESS_525558] been observed in clinical trial subjects.
Venetoclax was tested in a battery of safety pharmacology assays, and produced no 
effects in the CNS/neurobehavioral or respi[INVESTIGATOR_416898] 600 mg/kg.  No effects on QTc were observed up to a maximum plasma concentration of 46 μg/mL in dogs.  In conscious dogs, venetoclax did 
not produce any cardiovascular effects up to and including the highest oral dose of 150 mg/kg (C
max= 16 μg/mL).  In the anesthetized dog at higher plasma concentrations, 
venetoclax produced mild reductions in myoca rdial contractility (6% – 13%) and cardiac 
output (–11% to –19%) at plasma concentrations of ≥ 16 μ g/mL and ≥  32 μ g/mL, 
respectively.  These concentrations are greater than the plasma concentration of venetoclax in oncology subjects (2.8 μ g/mL at the 600 mg dose).
On the basis of nonclinical safety pharmacology and toxicology evaluations of venetoclax, and on the basis of nonclinical and human studies of related antiapoptotic Bcl-[ADDRESS_525559] identified a fetal toxicity risk.  Thrombocytopenia has not been observed in toxicology studies in mice and dogs.  These findings are consistent with venetoclax as a Bcl-2 specific (Bcl-X
Lsparing) 
inhibitor.  Consequently, thrombocytopenia is not expected to be a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) clinically.

Venetoclax Clinical Exposure
As of 28 November 2016, on the basis of data available in the [COMPANY_013] and 
Genentech/[COMPANY_002] clinical databases, a total of [ADDRESS_525561] 1 dose of venetoclax in the oncology development programs.  Of these 2573, 1429 subjects had CLL/small lymphocytic leukemia (SLL), [ADDRESS_525562] ranged from 20 mg to 1200 mg.  
Multiple ongoing Phase 1/2 [COMPANY_013] and Phase 1/2/3 Genentech/[COMPANY_002] clinical studies are 
evaluating safety, tolerability, pharmac okinetics, and efficacy of venetoclax as 
monotherapy or in combination with ot her therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (rituximab [R], obinutuzumab 
(GA101) [G], rituximab or obinutuzumab plus CHOP [cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone; R-CHOP or G- CHOP, respectively], BR, bendamustine plus 
obinutuzumab [BG], bortezomib plus dexamethasone, azacitidine or decitabine, and cytarabine) in subjects with hematologic malignancies.  Data are available from DDI studies of venetoclax interaction with ketoc onazole, with rifampin, and with warfarin.  
Additionally, two Phase 3 studies are ongoing:  one study in relapsed/refractory (R/R) CLL exploring the combination of venetoclax and rituximab against BR and one Phase [ADDRESS_525563] obinutuzumab plus chlorambucil.
Based on nonclinical and clinical data available with venetoclax administration, important 
identified risks are tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) and neutropenia, particularly in the CLL indication.  Infection is a potential risk.  Other adverse events commonly observed with venetoclax include nausea, diarrhea, and other hematological effects (including, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and lymphopenia).  Decreased spermatogenesis has been observed in

nonclinical studies with dogs and could present a risk to male infert ility.  In additi on, as 
venetoclax is being evaluated in subjects with relapsed/refractory (R/R) disease who had 
previously been treated with various cytotoxic agents, second primary malignancies are closely monitored.
Five dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) of tumo r lysis syndrome (TLS) and 2 DLTs of 
fatalities in the s etting of TLS were reported in the venetoclax clinical program for 
subjects with CLL/SLL (Study M12-175 and Study M13-365).  The 5 DLTs of TLS 
occurred in Study M12-175 at either the starting dose of 100 or 200 mg venetoclax (3 subjects in Cohort 1) or the lower initia l dose of 50 mg venetoclax implemented to 
minimize the risk of TLS ([ADDRESS_525565] each in Cohorts 2 and 4).  The sixth DLT of TLS occurred at the maximum designated cohort dose administered in the study (Cohort 8, 1200 mg), and the subject experienced sudden death.  In Study M13-365, there was a single DLT of death due to grade 5 hyperk alemia in a setting of TLS at the 50 mg initial 
dose.  (Additionally, single non-DLT adverse events of TLS were reported in a subject with MCL in Study M12-[ADDRESS_525566] with CLL in Study M13-365).  Events of laboratory TLS were also observed in 2 subjects during dosing in Study GP28331 at the step-up dose of 50 mg venetoclax.  Additional DLTs included 2 cases of febrile neutropenia and 1 case of neutropenia in subjects with CLL and NHL, and 1 case each of histiocytosis hematophagic and thrombocytopen ia in subjects with NHL (both considered 
related to rituximab r ather than venetoclax).
Updated safety and efficacy data are described in detail in the Investigator Brochure.

Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL)
Chronic lymphocytic leukemia is a lymphoproliferative disorder characterized by a progressive accumulation of monoclonal, small, mature-appearing CD5
+B cells in 
peripheral blood, bone marrow, and secondary lymp hoid organs.  It is the most common 
form of leukemia in adults in the Western World, accounting for approximately 30% of all leukemias.
11  Chronic lymphocytic le ukemia primarily affects elderly individuals; 
however, approximately one third of patients are less than 60 years of age at diagnosis.12  
Venetoclax (ABT-199)
M13-[ADDRESS_525567] 4,500 individuals will die of the disease.13  In 
Europe, CLL accounts for approximately 30% of all leukemias in adults with a reported age-standardized incidence rate of 3.79 per 100,000 individuals (for CLL/SLL) in the years 2000 – 2002.
11,14  The approximate 5-year survival rate for patients with CLL is 
73%.[ADDRESS_525568] not 
consistently offered survival advantage.  Treatment decisions for patients with CLL are made on the basis of considerations such as age, clinical stage, expected survival, and anticipated toxicities.  With the notable exception of allogeneic stem cell transplantation, CLL is currently an incurable disease, despi[INVESTIGATOR_416899].  Nonetheless, globally access to allogeneic stem cell transplant and/or clinical trials is limited, and treatment options for relapsed disease tend to have increased toxicity and reduced antitumor activity.
17p Deletion in Relapsed or Refractory CLL
17p deletion is a chromosomal aberration of prognostic relevance in CLL and accounts for 
up to 30% of all relapsed/refractory subjects with  CLL due to clonal cell evolution or the 
selection pressure of chemotherapy and chemoimmunotherapy.17-20

chromosome 17 abnormalities.
21  Overall response rates were also significantly lower in 
the patients with 17p deletion, with 35% of  subjects achieving partial remission, no CR 
and 5% nodular PR (nPR), compared to 74% response rate, with 30% CR and 14% nPR in the CLL subjects without 17p deletion ( Table 1 ).

# The marketing authorization for Alemtuzumab has been withdrawn at the request of the marketing-authorization

In the CLL population harboring 17p deletion, immunochemotherapy based regimens 
such as BR provide short durations of response with the median PFS of approximately 6.8 months and ORR of 7% ( Table 1 ).
25  Although novel therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], such as alemtuzumab 
based regimens and ofatumumab, show an improvement in ORR, the duration of response is still poor and the median PFS is approximately 6 months (Table 1 ).
22-24  Also 
alemtuzumab has limited use due to its toxicity profile.24  Due to the limited effectiveness 
of available therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], treatment guidelines recommend enrollment in clinical trials and in eligible patients who achieve a response allogeneic transplant, as preferred treatment

options for patients with 17p deletion.26,27  Nonetheless, globally the access to allogeneic 
transplant and/or clinical trials is limited, and physicians often continue to use 
immunochemotherapy.
17p Deletion in Previously Untreated CLL
Deletions of the short arm of chromosome 17 (17p deletion) are found in 3% to 10% of 
CLL cases at diagnosis.[ADDRESS_525571]-line and subsequent therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  There are currently no treatments approved and labeled specifically to meet the need of the 17p deletion population.  Because treatment with the conventional therapy is poor, the treatment guidelines
26,27
recommend that CLL patients with 17p deletion (as well as TP53 mutations) should be treated within new clinical trials from the start.  Those who achieve a response to init ial 
therapy should be considered for an allogen eic transplant.  For patients not eligible for an 
allogeneic transplant or clinical trial, until very recently suggested regimens included alemtuzumab, high-dose methylprednisolone (HDMP) or ofatumumab.  None of these regimens have been shown to be superior to  any other therapy in relapsed 17p deletion

4.0 Study Objectives
Main Cohort
The primary objective of this cohort is to evaluate the efficacy of venetoclax monotherapy in subjects with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) harboring the 17p deletion.  Efficacy will be measured by [CONTACT_34426] (ORR).
The secondary objectives are to evaluate the complete remission rate (CR rate), partial 
remission rate (PR rate), duration of overall response (DOR), progression-free survival (PFS), event-free survival,  time to progression (TTP), time to first response, time to 50% reduction in ALC, overall survival (OS) and percent of subjects who move on to stem cell transplant.  The safety and tolerability of venetoclax in subjects with relapsed or 
refractory CLL harboring 17p deletion will also be evaluated.
Safety Expansion Cohort
The primary objective of the safety expansio n cohort is to evaluate the safety of 
venetoclax in approximately 50 subjects with relapsed/refractory or previously untreated 
CLL harboring 17p deletion treated per the updated TLS prophylaxis and management measures.

M13-[ADDRESS_525577] response, time to 50% reduction in ALC, overall survival, and percent of subjects who move on to stem cell transplant.
Exploratory objectives will be evaluated in both cohorts.  Time to next anti-CLL 
treatment (TTNT) and minimal residual disease (MRD), assessed in the peripheral blood and/or bone marrow (BM), will be measured.  Pharmacokinetics, pharmacogenetics and biomarkers will also be evaluated as exploratory objectives.  Health Economic and Patient-Reported Outcome Measures will include the MDASI (measure of subject reported symptoms), the EORTC QLQ-C30 and EORTC QLQ CLL16 (a measure of health r elated quality of life sp ecific to CLL) and the EQ-5D-5L (measure of general 
health status) and EQ-5D-VAS.
5.0 Investigational Plan
5.1 Overall Study Design and Plan:  Description
This is an open-label, single arm, multicenter , global study to determine the efficacy of 
venetoclax monotherapy in subjects with r elapsed/refractory or previously untreated 
chronic lymphocytic leukemia harboring 17p deletion sponsored by [CONTACT_416957]/[COMPANY_002].  Previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia harboring 17p deletion patients will not be enrolled in [LOCATION_013].
This study is designed to enroll in the main cohort approximately 100 subjects with 
relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia harboring 17p deletion, as confirmed by [CONTACT_2237], and in the safety expansion cohort approximately 50 subjects with relapsed/refractory or previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia harboring 17p deletion as confirmed by [CONTACT_416958], to meet scientific and regulatory 
objectives without enrolling an undue number of subjects in alignment with ethical considerations.  Therefore, if the target number of subjects has been enrolled, there is a possibility that additional subjects in screening will not be enrolled.
Venetoclax (ABT-199)
M13-[ADDRESS_525578] 12 weeks of study treatment in 
the main cohort, a safety analysis will be conducted by [CONTACT_269395] (IDMC).  In the safety expansion cohort, interim analysis results will be reviewed by [CONTACT_416959] [ADDRESS_525579] completed approximately 2 – 3 weeks of the lead-in period.
Main Cohort Dosing Schedule
NOTE:  Enrollment in the main cohort is complete, and all subjects have completed the 
lead-in period under Protocol Amendment 1.
Venetoclax will be administered orally once daily (QD), continuously.  Each dose of 
venetoclax should be taken with approximately [ADDRESS_525580]'s first meal of the day.  To mitigate the risk for TLS, a lead-in period (up to 5 weeks) will be employed to evaluate a step wise dose escalation.  All subjects will be admitted to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_416892]-in period with an initial test dose of [ADDRESS_525581] dose of 50 mg will be administered on Week 1 Day 2 followed by 50 mg venetoclax QD for 5 days (Week 1 Day 3 – Day 7).  If significant findings occur within [ADDRESS_525582] dose of 20 mg venetoclax on Week 1 Day 1, the 20 mg dose will be maintained for 1 week prior to dose escalation to 50 mg on Week 2 Day 1 – 7.
After a week at 50 mg, the following dose escalation will proceed with weekly dose 
escalations → 100 mg →200 mg → 400 mg (or additional lead-in steps to designated 
400 mg dose), as tolerated.
A lower starting dose and/or modification to the lead-in regimen may be implemented for 
individual subject(s) at particularly high risk for TLS ( Figure 1 ).

If none of the electrolyte and/or lymphocyte changes described in 1 and/or [ADDRESS_525588] will remain on the 50 mg dose through Week 1 (e.g., Week 1 Day 2 – Week 1 Day 7).  If abnormalities are observed, no additional venetoclax doses will be administered until resolution.
After the subject has received the 50 mg dose for approximately a week (6 – 7 days), the 
following dose escalation will proceed with weekly dose escalations 
→100 mg →200 mg 
→400 mg (or additional lead-in steps to designated 400 mg dose), as tolerated.
For all dose escalations, laboratory values for subject management must be reviewed inreal time by [CONTACT_416960]'s next dose to ensure appropriate subject management.  Based upon the laboratory values, the subject may continue dosing, may need to hold dose until resolution, may require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_416900]-dose laboratory checks.

b. For samples analyzed locally, at room temperature, rasburicase causes enzymatic degradation of the uric acid in 
blood/plasma/serum samples potentially resulting in spuriously low plasma uric acid assay readings.  The 
following special sample handling procedure must be followed to avoid ex vivo uric acid degradation.  Uric acid must be analyzed in plasma.  Blood must be collected into pre-chilled tubes containing heparin anticoagulant.  Immediately immerse plasma samples for uric acid measurement in an ice water bath.   Plasma samples must 
be prepared by [CONTACT_26795] a pre-cooled centrifuge (4°C).  Finally, the plasma must be maintained in an ice

The ECG results will be used by [CONTACT_197778], including 
adverse event determination and management, dose escalation, and termination of subjects from the study.  ECG resu lts will be summarized as follows:
●normal ECG
●abnormal ECG – not clinically significant
●abnormal ECG – clinically significant
●unable to evaluate
Any reports that are abnormal and clinically significant will be faxed to the Oncology Safety Management Team via the contact [CONTACT_222644] 6.1.6 within 
5 business days of obtaining the results.  The QT interval measurement will be documented in the eCRF only if a "prol onged QT" is observed.  Correction by [CONTACT_416970] (QTcF) is preferred; how ever, correction by [CONTACT_416971] A bbVie medical monitor.  The original ECG 
tracing will be retained in the subject's records at the study site.
Assessment of Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) 
Assessment of ejection fraction will be made at screening by [CONTACT_416972] a 
Multi Gated Acquisition Scan (MUGA) at the discretion of the investigator.  Subsequent 
evaluation of LVEF will be made as clinically indicated for subjects who develop signs of 
cardiac compromise.
Disease Assessments (2008 Modified IWCLL NCI-WG Guidelines)
Clinical response will be assessed by [CONTACT_416973] 
(hematology laboratory values) and comp lete physical examination.  In addition, based 
upon the clinical response (CR/CRi/PR), a CT scan of involved anatomic regions (or MRI if CT is medically contraindicated), and bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_416911] (ABT-199)
M13-[ADDRESS_525673] imaging (or MRI).
Analysis of clinical laboratory values and physical examination will be performed at 
the following visits:
●Screening
●Week 5 Day 1
●Week 8 Day 1
●Week 12 Day 1
●Week 16 Day 1
●Week 20 Day 1
●Week 24 Day 1
●Week 28 Day 1
●Week 32 Day 1
●Week 36 Day 1 and Day 1 of every 12 weeks thereafter (e.g., Weeks 48, 60,

●No earlier than [ADDRESS_525674] met (if applicable)
●Final Visit
●Post Treatment Visits, if applicable
Note:  Disease Assessments may be performed within 72 hours prior to or after the 
scheduled visit starting with Week 8 Day 1.
Response criteria definitions are outlined in Section [IP_ADDRESS] .
Computed Tomography (CT) Scans (or Magnetic Resonance Imaging [MRI])
A CT scan with contrast must be performed within [ADDRESS_525675] scans (with contrast) should include neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvic sequences.  A contrast-enhanced MRI of the neck, chest, abdomen 
Venetoclax (ABT-199)
M13-[ADDRESS_525676] is medically contraindicated (i.e., subjects with an allergy to CT contrast agents or subjects with impaired renal clearance).  Whichever method is used at Screening, it should be used consistently through the duration of the study.
When a response (PR or CR) is determined by [CONTACT_316316] (e.g., laboratory 
tests/physical exam) at any time during the study, a CT scan must be performed no earlier than [ADDRESS_525677]'s last scan.  For subjects whose response meets criteria for a PR at the time of the Week [ADDRESS_525678] scan should be performed (no earlier than 8 weeks following the Week 36 scan) if a subsequent clinical disease assessment indicates that a CR or CRi has been achieved.
If a subject exhibits clinical signs of possible disease progression (i.e., increased or 
de novo enlargement of liver, spleen or lymph nodes on physical examination) without an increase in lymphocytes meeting PD criteria , a CT scan must be performed within 
2 weeks to confirm or rule out PD as described in Section [IP_ADDRESS] according to Modified 
IWCLL NCI-WG Criteria for Tumor Response.
In addition to being reviewed by [CONTACT_1755]/or site staff, an independent review 
will be performed to assess tumor response and disease progression.  Clinical data and radiographic scans will be interpreted according to 2008 Modified IWCLL NCI-WGGuidelines for Tumor Response (refer to Table 8 ).  The independent review facility will 
provide instructions re garding the preparation and shipment of the data.  Interpretations 
from the independent review will not be sent to the site.  Subject treatment management will be based on review by [CONTACT_94561]/or site staff.

[IP_ADDRESS] Handling/Processing of Samples
Blood and plasma samples must be protected  from direct sunlight during collection, 
processing and storage.  Immediately after collection, the blood samples for venetoclax 
will be inverted 8 to 10 times to ensure good mixing of the blood and anticoagulant, and will be placed in an ice bath.  The blood samples will be centrifuged using a refrigerated centrifuge (2° to 8°C) to separate the plasma at 1100 to 1600 × g for approximately 10 to 15 minutes.  The plasma samples will be transferred using plastic pi[INVESTIGATOR_416925]-capped polypropylene tubes (cryovials) labeled with the drug number name, assay type, type of sample (plasma), the protocol number, the subject number, the study week and day, and the planned time of sampling relative to dosing and then frozen at –20°C or colder.  The entire process should be completed within one hour of draw.  Samples should be maintained at –20°C or colder until shipped to the central laboratory.
[IP_ADDRESS] Disposition of Samples
The frozen plasma samples for venetoclax (and possible metabolite[s]) assay will be 
packed in dry ice sufficient to last during tran sport and shipped from the study site to the 
central laboratory according to instructions included in the Laboratory Manual for this study.  An inventory of the samples incl uded will accompany the package.  The central 
laboratory will be responsible for shippi[INVESTIGATOR_416926].

under the supervision of the Drug Analysis Department at [COMPANY_013].
5.3.3 Efficacy Variables
The primary objective of the main cohort is to evaluate the efficacy of venetoclax 
monotherapy in subjects with relapsed or refractory ch ronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) 
harboring the 17p deletion.  Efficacy will be  measured by [CONTACT_34426] (ORR).  
The secondary objectives are to evaluate CR, PR, duration of overall response, determine

progression-free survival (PFS), event free survival, time to progression (TTP), time to 
first response, time to 50% reduction in ALC, overall survival (OS) and percent of subjects who move on to stem cell transplant.
For the safety expansion cohort in sub jects with relapsed/re fractory or previously 
untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) harboring the 17p deletion, efficacy will 
be considered a secondary endpoint.  The secondary objectives are to evaluate ORR, CR, PR, duration of overall response, determine progression-free survival (PFS), event free survival, time to progression (TTP), time to first response, time to 50% reduction in ALC, overall survival (OS), and percent of subjects who move on to stem cell transplant.
Analyses of these endpoints are described in Section 8.0.
[IP_ADDRESS] 2008 Modified IWCLL NCI-WG Guidelines for Tumor 
Response
For disease assessments, response will be assessed by [CONTACT_416982] (hemato logy laboratory values), complete physical 
examination, contrast-enhanced CT scan of involved anatomic regions, bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_12752].  If a contrast-enhanced  CT is medically contraindicated (e.g., subjects 
with an allergy to CT contrast agents or subjects with impaired renal clearance), a contrast-enhanced MRI of all involved anatomical regions plus a non-contrast CT of the chest should be done.  Subjects will be evaluated against the [ADDRESS_525720] imaging (or MRI).
At Screening, all measurable disease must be documented by [CONTACT_225687] (hematology laboratory values), physical examination, CT scan, and bone marrow.  All baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the beginning of treatment and never more than [ADDRESS_525721] be completed within 5 weeks before the beginning of the treatment.  All other tumor assessments after baseline should be performed within 7 days after the scheduled visit.

Beginning at Week 5 Day 1, disease response will be assessed by [CONTACT_416983] a complete physical examination.  When a response (PR or CR) is determined by [CONTACT_316316] (laboratory tests and physical exam) at any time during the study, a CT scan must be performed no earlier than [ADDRESS_525723]'s last scan.  For subjects whose response meets criteria for a PR at the time of the Week [ADDRESS_525724] scan should be performed (no earlier than 8 weeks following the Week 36 scan) if a subsequent clinical disease assessment indicates that a CR or CRi has been achieved.
If a subject exhibits clinical signs of possible disease progression (i.e., increased or 
de novo enlargement of liver, spleen or lymph nodes on physical examination) without an increase in lymphocytes meeting PD criteria, then additional assessments including contrast-enhanced CT scan and/or bone marrow must be performed within 2 weeks to confirm or rule out PD.
Methods of Measurement
Disease response and progression will be assessed by [CONTACT_416984], clinical 
examination, radiographic techniques and bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_12752].
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize 
each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow-up.
Details on the analysis of peripheral blood required to assess response are provided in 
Section [IP_ADDRESS] , Study Procedures.

A physical examination should be performed to assess the extent of disease involvement.  
All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler or calipers.  Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial (e.g., palpable lymph nodes).  The diameter, in two planes, of the largest palpable nodes in each of the following sites should be measure d:  cervical, supraclavicular, axillary, 
inguinal, and femoral.  Evaluation for the presence of hepatomegaly and splenomegaly should be performed.
The [ADDRESS_525726] bi-dimensional lesions should be recorded in the eCRF.
●Target Lesions:  A maximum of 12 target lesions may be selected (up to 
6 nodal and 6 extranodal).  Target nodal lesions must be abnormal (> 1.5 cm in 
LDi at baseline), clearly measurable and suitable for consistent, reproducible measurement in at least two perpendicular dimensions.  Target extranodal 
lesions must be > 1 cm in tw o perpendicular diameters at baseline. 
●Non-Target Lesions:  A maximum of [ADDRESS_525727] be abnormal (> 1.5 cm in LDi at baseline).  
Non-target extranodal lesions must be > 1 cm in two perpendicular diameters.  Nodal and extranodal lesions that were not selected as target lesions at baseline 
can be followed as non-target lesions.
Computed tomography (CT) is the preferre d method to measure lesions selected for 
response assessment.  Contrast-enhanced CT scans with anatomical coverage of the neck, 
chest, abdomen, and pelvis should be performed.  CT scans for response assessment may be limited to areas of prior involvement only, if required by [CONTACT_190409].  
Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans with anatomical coverage of the neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis plus a non-contrast CT scan of the chest may be used if CT is medically contraindicated (e.g., severe contrast allergy).  Whichever scanning method was used at baseline must be used during follow-up.  Conventional CT and MRI should be performed with cuts of [ADDRESS_525728] 
should be performed by [CONTACT_2363] 5 mm cont iguous reconstruction algorithm; this 
specification applies to the regions of the neck, chest, abdomen and pelvis.

Procedures.In addition to being reviewed by [CONTACT_1755]/or site staff, an independent review 
will be performed to assess tumor response and disease progression.  Clinical criteria and radiographic scans will be evaluated using the 2008 Modified IWCLL NCI-WG Guidelines for Tumor Response (refer to Table 8 ).  The independent review facility will 
provide instructions  regarding the preparation and shipment of the data.  Interpretations 
from the independent review will not be sent to the site.  Subject treatment management will be based on review by [CONTACT_94561]/or site staff.
Disease Response Criteria
Complete Remission (CR)
CR requires all of the following criteria:
●Peripheral blood lymphocytes (evalu ated by [CONTACT_26850]) 
below 4 × 109/L (4000/μ L)
●Absence of lymphadenopathy (absence of nodes > [ADDRESS_525730] diameter 
or any extra nodal disease) by [CONTACT_26851]
●No hepatomegaly or splenomegaly by [CONTACT_5292] (as determined by 
[CONTACT_416985]) and CT scan (if abnormal prior to therapy or if physical exam is inconclusive at the time of evaluation)
●Absence of disease or constitutional symptoms (B symptoms:  unexplained fevers > 38°C or 100.4°F, drenching night sweats, > 10% body mass weight 
loss in the preceding 6 months)
●Blood counts above the following laboratory values:
○Neutrophils > 1.5 × 10
9/L [1500/μL] (without the need for exogenous
growth factors)
Venetoclax (ABT-199)
M13-[ADDRESS_525731] 2012-004027-20
98
○Platelets > 100 × 109/L [100,000/ μL] (without the need for platelet 
transfusion or exogenous growth factors)
○Hemoglobin > 110 g/L [11 g/dL] (without the need for blood transfusions 
or exogenous eryth ropoietin)
●Bone marrow at least normocellular for age, < 30 % of nucleated cells being 
lymphocytes.  Lymphoid nodul es should be absent.  Bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_416928]/CRi has been 
achieved by [CONTACT_306900], physical exam and CT scan.  If the bone marrow 
is hypocellular, a repeat determination should be made in [ADDRESS_525732] recovered.  A marrow biopsy should be 
compared to a pre-treatment marrow if available.  Subjects who are otherwise 
in a complete remission, but bone marrow nodules can be identified 
histologically should be considered to be nodular PR (nPR) .  
Immunohistochemistry should be performed  to define whether these nodules 
are composed of primarily T cells or lymphocytes other than CLL cells, or CLL cells.
Complete Remission with Inc omplete Marrow Recovery (CRi)
Subjects who fulfill the criteria for CR (including bone marrow) but who have persistent 
cytopenia (anemia or thrombocytopenia or neutropenia) apparently unrelated to CLL but related to drug toxicity will be considered CRi.  The marrow evaluation described above should be performed with scrutiny and not show any clonal infiltrate.
Partial Remission (PR)
To be considered a PR at least 2of the following must be met:
●≥  50% decrease in peripheral blood lymphocyte count from the pretreatment
baseline value.
●≥  50% reduction in lymphadenopathy.
●≥  50% reduction in the enlargement of the liver and/or spleen (if abnormal 
prior to therapy).

[IP_ADDRESS] Definition of Disease Progression
Disease progression according to [ADDRESS_525744] one of the following:
●Appearance of any new lesion, such as enlarged lymph nodes (> 1.5 cm), 
splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, or other organ infiltrates.  An increase by 50% 
or more in greatest determined diameter  of any previous site and > 1.5 cm.
●An increase in the previously noted enlargement of the liver or spleen by 50% or more or the de novo appearance of hepatomegaly or splenomegaly.
●An increase in the number of blood lymphocytes by 50% or more with at least 5,[ADDRESS_525745] response while on study.
●Transformation to a more aggressive  histology (e.g., Richter's Syndrome).  
Whenever possible, this diagnosis should be established by [CONTACT_416986].  For subjects experiencing disease progression due to Richter's Syndrome while on study, supplemental data may be collected.
●Occurrence of cytopenia (neutrope nia, anemia or thrombocytopenia) 
attributable to CLL only if confirmed by a bone marrow assessment showing unequivocal progression.

considered to have stable disease.
5.3.4 Safety Variables
The following safety evaluations will be performed during the study:  adverse event 
monitoring, vital signs, physical examination, ECG, and laboratory assessments.
5.3.5 Pharmacokinetic Variables
Values for the PK parameters of venetoclax, including the apparent clearance (CL/F), and 
the apparent volume of distribution (V/F), may be determined using a population PK approach.  Additional parameters may be calculated if useful in the interpretation of the data.
5.3.[ADDRESS_525747]'s response to 
venetoclax in terms of pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety.  Such genetic factors may include, for example, drug metabolizing enzymes, drug transport proteins, CLL prognostic markers and Bcl-[ADDRESS_525748] to identify 
genetic factors involved in the response to study drugs.  The samples may also be used for the development of diagnostic tests related to venetoclax (or drugs of this class).  The results of pharmacogenetic analyses may not be reported with the study summary.
5.3.7 Biomarker Variables
Several putative biomarkers of efficacy and response may be evaluated in this protocol 
with the goal of defining the relationship between various disease markers and disease 
status.  Biospecimens collected during the course of this study may be banked and used in the future to investigate new scientific questions  related to this study.  The samples may

store the samples in a secure storage space with adequate measures to protect confidentiality.  The samples will be retained while research on venetoclax (or drugs of this class) continues but no longer than 20 years.
Examination of the serum components of subjects on this venetoclax clinical trial may 
reveal patterns of cell-free nucleic acids, proteins/peptides or metabolites that may be further evaluated in future clinical studies to determine any prognostic value and any correlation with clinical response.  Serum samples may also be analyzed for predictive or drug-responsive markers.  In the event that any serum samples are unused, remaining samples may be banked for use in diagnostic test development efforts.
DNA methylation regulates gene expression (inactivates certain genes and their normal 
role); aberrant methylation of specific genes is associated with cancer development and poor clinical outcome.  Genes with variable methylation status that are known to have prognostic implications may be assessed in the trial.  These analyses may examine putative stratification markers for correlation for efficacy.
Venetoclax inhibits the ability of cancer cells to evade cell death, or apoptosis, by 
[CONTACT_416987]-apoptotic protein Bcl-2.  Nonclinical studies have 
demonstrated a pattern of response to venetoclax based on the lev els of Bcl-2 family 
proteins.  High levels of Bcl-2 a nd low levels of Mcl-1 and Bcl-X

predictive of response to this drug in vitro.  Therefore, the proteins levels of relevant BCL-2 family members may be determined in  tumor cells isolated from the bone marrow

Genetic amplification, chromosomal loss and/or mutational/methylation status of various genes represent genetic lesions potentially  associated with s ubject outcome.  Nucleic 
acids, protein expression, and/or mutational/methylation analysis may be conducted on CLL cells isolated from blood, bone marrow and/or tumor tissue samples and/or DNA/RNA extracted from serum from subjects participating in this study.  Analysis of the nucleic acids can be used to identify and track the CLL cells for MRD.  The analysis

may include but is not limited to members of the BCL-2 family, p53, Notch-1 and other 
genes/proteins that may be informative to ve netoclax mechanism of action or CLL disease 
progression.  Additionally, comprehensive genomic sequencing of CLL cells isolated 
from the blood or bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_416930].  FISH may be conducted on tissue from tumor samples and/or CLL cells from subjects participating in this study to assess amplifications and translocations in the Bcl-2 gene and other alteration in genes associated with CLL, which may prove to be informative.  The potential relationship 
between amplification/loss/mutation/methylatio n of these genes and the clinical outcome 
in these subjects may be examined as a subject stratification tool.  Biospecimens collected during the course of this study may be banked and used in the future to investigate new scientific questions related to this study.
5.3.8 Health Economic and Patient-Reported Outcome Measures
MDASI
The MDASI is a multi-symptom PRO measure for clinical and research use.  The 
M.D. Anderson Symptom Inventory37contains 13 core symptom severity items (pain, 
fatigue, nausea, disturbed sleep, distess [emotional], shortness of breath, lack of appetite, drowsiness, dry mouth, sadness, vomiting, difficulty remembering, and numbness or tingling), 6 symptom interference items  (general activity,  mood, walking ab ility, normal 
work, relations with other people, and enjoyment of life), and 5 chronic lymphocytic leukemia specific items (abdominal pain, lymph node pain, night sweating, fevers/temperature fluctuation, and frequent infections).
Mean symptom, symptom interference, domain and total scores will be calculated for 
each observation as defined in the MDASI scoring manual and then summarized (mean, std. dev., median) at each assessment; in addition mean change in each of these values (final assessment versus baseline) will be calculated to identify any statistically significant differences versus baseline.

EORTC QLQ-C30 and EORTC QLQ CLL16
The EORTC QLQ-C30 consists of a Global Health Status/QoL scale, a Financial 
Difficulties scale, five Functional scales (Cognitive Functioning, Social Functioning, Physical Functioning, Emotional Functioning, and Role Functioning), and eight Symptom scales/items (Fatigue, Insomnia, Appetite Loss, Pain, Constipation, Diarrhea, Dyspnea, and Nausea and Vomiting).
Each of these domains will be calculated as per the EORTC scoring manual, and 
summarized (mean, std. dev., median) at each assessment; in addition mean change in each of these values (final assessment versus baseline) will be calculated to identify any statistically significant differences versus baseline.
The five EORTC QLQ CLL16 domains (Fatigue, Treatment Side Effects and Disease

EQ-5D-5L and EQ-5D-VAS
The EuroQol 5 Dimensions (EQ-5D-5L) is a generic preference instrument that has been validated in numerous populations.  The EQ-5 D-5L has five dimensions:  mobility, 
self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. These dimensions are 
measured on a five level scale:  no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and extreme problems.  The EQ-5D-5L also contains a visual analog scale (VAS) to assess the subject's overall health.

5.6 Discussion and Justification of Study Design
There are currently no treatments approved and labeled specifically to meet the need of 
the 17p deletion population and currently available treatments for the broader CLL population, such as FCR and BR, are not adequate for this patient population.  Due to the 
Venetoclax (ABT-199)
M13-[ADDRESS_525769] 2012-004027-20
113
limited effectiveness of available therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], treatment guidelines recommend enrollment 
in clinical trials as a preferred treatment option for patients with 17p deletion.  Those patients who achieve a response to initial therapy should be considered for an allogeneic transplant.  For relapsed/refractory patients not eligible for an allogeneic transplant, suggested regimens in cases where a clinical trial is not available include alemtuzumab; however, alemtuzumab has limited use due to its toxicity profile and its efficacy signals are more limited in subjects with bulky disease.
Untreated CLL patients who harbor the 17p deletion have generally a short first remission 
if they respond to conventional chemotherapy such as fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (FCR) and alemtuzumab, because 17p deletion is a prognostic marker for nonresponse to standard chemotherapy.  Thus, novel treatment strategies, which act independently of the p53 signaling pathway are needed.
Antiapoptotic Bcl-[ADDRESS_525770] response reported for 54 evaluable subjects with 
CLL/SLL was 7 (13%) s ubjects with complete remission (CR) or CR with incomplete 
marrow recovery (CRi), 39 (72%) with partial remission (PR),4 (7%) with stable disease 
(SD), 0% with progressive disease (PD), and 4 (7%) subjects discontinued prior to Week 6. The response rate (CR + PR) was 85%.

clinical findings support the possibility of e fficacy in this pati ent population.  As CLL 
subjects with 17p deletion who relapse have very limited treatment options, it is appropriate to enroll such subjects in a clinical trial of an investigational agent.

5.6.4 Selection of Doses in the Study
The dose of 400 mg was selected on the basis of preliminary data in relapsed/refractory 
CLL/SLL subjects from the ongoing venetoclax first-in-human Study M12-175.  
A time-to-response model and a logistic-re gression model were developed using data 
from Study M12-175 to understand the relationship between the response outcome and 
the final target venetoclax dose.  Both models found that a faster response was achieved with a higher final target dose.  Further analysis focused on comparing 400 mg and 600 mg as the final target dose showed a minimum difference on the overall response rate (i.e., percentage of subjects with partial response or better).  With doses below 400 mg QD, however, a longer (and clinically unfavorable) duration will be needed to achieve the same response rate.  Since there is no strong difference between 400 mg and 600 mg as the final dose, the 400 mg dose was selected as the minimum effective dose.  This 400 mg QD venetoclax dose has been deemed tolerable in Study M12-175.
To mitigate the risk for TLS, a step-wise lead-in period (up to 5 weeks) will be employed 
to escalate venetoclax dose to the treatment dose of 400 mg.
The maximum dose in this study is 400 m g, however currently the established maximum 
clinical dose of venetoclax is not to exceed 1200 mg/day for a duration not to exceed 
[ADDRESS_525774]/device after it is released for 
distribution.

For serious adverse events considered as having "no reasonable possibility" of being associated with study drug, the investigator will provide an "Other" cause of the event.  For adverse events to be considered intermittent, the events must be of similar nature and severity.  Adverse events, whether in response to a quer y, observed by [CONTACT_8786], or reported

6.1.1 Definitions
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Event
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or 
clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this  treatment.  An adverse event can therefore 
be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not the event is considered causally related to the use of the product.
Such an event can result from use of the drug as stipulated in the protocol or labeling, as 
well as from accidental or intentional ove rdose, drug abuse, or drug withdrawal.  Any 
worsening of a pre-existing condition or illne ss is considered an adverse event.  
Worsening in severity of a reported adverse event should be reported as a new adverse event.  Laboratory abnormalities and changes in vital signs are considered to be adverse 
events only if they result in discontinuation from the study, necessitate therapeutic

117
medical intervention, meets protocol specific criteria (see Section 6.1.8 regarding toxicity 
management) and/or if the investigator considers them to be adverse events. 
An elective surgery/procedure scheduled to occur during a study will not be considered an 
adverse event if the surgery/procedure is b eing performed for a pre-existing condition and 
the surgery/procedure has been pre-planned prior to study entry.  However, if the 
pre-existing condition deteriorates unexpected ly during the study (e.g., surgery performed 
earlier than planned), then the deterioration of the condition for which the elective surgery/procedure is being done will be considered an adverse event.
A treatment-emergent adverse event is defined as any adverse event reported by a subject 
with onset or worsening from the time that the first dose of venetoclax is administered 
until [ADDRESS_525778] elapsed following discontinuation of study drug administration.
[IP_ADDRESS] Serious Adverse Events
If an adverse event meets any of the following criteria, it is to be reported to [COMPANY_013] as a 
serious adverse event (SAE) within [ADDRESS_525779]'s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408].  This 
does not include an emergency room visit or admission to an 
outpatient facility.
Congenital Anomaly An anomaly detected at or after birth, or any anomaly that 
results in fetal loss.
Venetoclax (ABT-199)
M13-[ADDRESS_525780] 2012-004027-20
118
Persistent or 
Significant 
Disability/IncapacityAn event that results in a condition that substantially 
interferes with the activities of d aily living of a study subject.  
Disability is not intended to include experiences of relatively 
minor medical significance such as headache, nausea, 
vomiting, diarrhea, influen za, and accidental trauma 
(e.g., sprained ankle).
Important Medical Event Requiring 
Medical or Surgical Intervention to 
Prevent Serious 
OutcomeAn important medical event that may not be immediately 
life-threatening or result in d eath or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but based
on medical judgment may jeopardize the subject and may 
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the 
outcomes listed above (i.e., death of subject, life-threatening, 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], prolongation of  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], congenital 
anomaly, or persistent or significant disability/incapacity).  
Additionally, any elective or spontaneous abortion or 
stillbirth is considered an important medical event.  Examples of such events include allergic bronchospasm requiring 
intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, bl ood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.
For serious adverse events with the outcome of death, the date and cause of death will be 
recorded on the appropriate case report form.
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_58170] a subject to allow observation and management (e.g., for IV hydration) 
for the purpose of TLS prophylaxis will not be captured as a serious adverse event (SAE), 
unless there is an additional reason for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_147529] (e.g., abnormal post-dose TLS laboratories that necessitate therapeutic medical intervention, etc.).
Certain adverse events are anticipated to occur in the study population (CLL) at some 
frequency independent of drug exposure.  Such events include known consequences of the 
underlying disease under investigation (e.g., symptoms, disease progression) and events unlikely to be related to the underlying disease under investigation but common in the 
Venetoclax (ABT-199)
M13-[ADDRESS_525781] 2012-004027-20
119
study population independent of drug therapy (e.g., cardiovascular events in an elderly 
population).
These events are listed in Appendix E .
These adverse events may occur alone or in various combinations and are considered 
expected for reporting purposes for this protocol.
An Independent Data Monitoring Co mmit tee will monitor the incidence of these expected 
events during the study.  An aggregate report of any clinically relevant imbalances that do 
not favor the test product will be submitted to health authorities.
Although exempted from expedited reporting to certain Health Authorities and ECs/IRBs 
as individual cases, if an event commonly associated with CLL or progression of CLL meets seriousness criteria, it must be reported to [COMPANY_013] within 24 hours of the site being made aware of the serious adverse event (as defined in Section 6.1.6 ).  For deaths related 
to disease progression (coded to malignant neoplasm progression), the date and cause of death will be recorded on the appropriate case report form, but the event will not be expedited as an individual case safety report (ICSR) to regulatory authorities.
6.1.2 Adverse Event Severity
The investigator will rate the severity of each adverse event according to the National 
Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE Version 4.0).
[ADDRESS_525782] the change in severity.  The dates on the AE's cannot overlap.  For all reported serious adverse events that increase in severity, th e supplemental eCRFs also need to be updated 
to reflect any changes due to the increase in severity.  For adverse events not captured by [CONTACT_416992], the following should be used:

(mild).
Grade [ADDRESS_525784]'s usual activities (moderate).
Grade [ADDRESS_525785]'s usual activities and may be incapacitating (moderate to 
severe).
Grade 4 The adverse event is life-threatening requiring urgent 
intervention (severe).
Grade [ADDRESS_525786] (severe).
6.1.3 Relationship to Study Drug
The investigator will use the following definitions to assess the relationship of the adverse 
event to the use of study drug:
Reasonable 
PossibilityAfter consideration of factors including timing of the event, 
biologic plausibility, clinical judgment, and potential alternative 
causes, there is sufficient evidence (information) to suggest a 
causal relationship.
No Reasonable PossibilityAfter consideration of factors including timing of the event, 
biologic plausibility, clinical judgment, and potential alternative causes, there is insufficient evidence (information) to suggest a 
causal relationship.
For causality assessments, events assessed as having a reasonable possibility of being 
related to the study drug will be considered "associated."  Events assessed as having no reasonable possibility of being related to study  drug will be considered "not associated."  
In addition, when the investigator has not repor ted causality or deemed it not assessable, 
[COMPANY_013] will consider the event associated.  If an investigator's opi[INVESTIGATOR_416932], an "Other" cause of event must be 
provided by [CONTACT_26278].

6.1.4 Adverse Events Expected Due to Study Related Endpoints
[IP_ADDRESS] Deaths
For this protocol, overall survival is an e fficacy endpoint.  Deaths that occur during the 
protocol specified adverse event reporting period (see Section 6.1.6 ) that are more likely 
related to disease progression will therefore be  an expected adverse event and will not be 
subject to expedited reporting.
Death should be considered an outcome and not a distinct event.  The event or condition 
that caused or contributed to the fatal outcome should be recorded as the single medical concept on the Adverse Event eCRF.  Generally, only one such event should be reported.  The term "sudden death" should only be used for the occurrence of an abrupt and unexpected death due to presumed cardiac causes in a patient with or without pre-existing heart disease, within [ADDRESS_525788] seen alive and stable.  If the cause of death is unknown and cannot be ascertained at the time of reporting, "unexplained death" should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.  If the cause of death later becomes available (e.g., after autopsy), "unexplained death" should not be replaced by [CONTACT_25749]. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Lack of Efficacy or Worsening of Disease
Events that are clearly consistent with the expected pattern of progression of the 
underlying disease are also considered an expected outcome for this study and will not be subject to expedited reporting.
6.1.5 Adverse Event Collection Period

6.1.8 Toxicity Management
[IP_ADDRESS] Prophylaxis and Management of Tumor Lysis Syndrome
There is a potential for tumor lysis syndrome in subjects, affected by [CONTACT_416996], elevated pretreatment lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, elevated le ukocyte count, renal dysfunction, and 
dehydration.
In response to the events of TLS reported in the Phase [ADDRESS_525796] is determined upon study entry.

risk factors for developi[INVESTIGATOR_26638].
TLS Prophylaxis and Monitoring Checklist will be completed throughout the lead-in 
period to ensure proper TLS prophylaxis measures.
For tumor lysis syndrome prophylaxis, subjects have been classified in 3 risk categories 
based on the risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_416934].  The tumor burden assessed by [CONTACT_416997]:

by [CONTACT_417000] ≥ 25 × 10
9/L AND any measurable lymph node with the 
largest diameter ≥ 5 cm but < [ADDRESS_525798] dose of venetoclax at 20 mg and at 50 mg.  Tumor 
lysis syndrome prophylaxis includes:
●An oral agent to reduce the uric acid level (e.g., allopurinol) to be initiated at 
least [ADDRESS_525799] use another uric acid reducer.
●Oral hydration consisting of fluid intake of 1.[ADDRESS_525800]-dose for subjects who 
demonstrate any laboratory changes.  Or al hydration should be maintained, as 
tolerated, even during the days the subjects receive IV hydration.
●Serum chemistry and hematology laboratory samples (low and medium risk subjects) must be drawn anytime within [ADDRESS_525801] dose of venetoclax in

order to keep the treatment on schedule.  The investigator's decision to proceed 
with venetoclax treatment initiation may  be based on these laboratory values.
●For subjects demonstrating any clinically significant laboratory abnormalities in this baseline laboratory assessment, the first dose of venetoclax at [ADDRESS_525803] be delayed until resolution and management of the laboratory a bnormalities should be initiated, per the protocol Appendix D
(Recommendations for Initial Management of Electrolyte Abnormalities and Prevention of Tumor Lysis Syndrome [TLS]).  If needed, the subject should receive additional treatment prior to the initiation of dosing.
Additional TLS prophylaxis and monitoring procedures are tailored to the individual TLS 
risk category as follows:
Low Risk Category
Subjects in the Low Risk category can begin the venetoclax lead-in period in the 
outpatient setting if there is no indication to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_18552].
●For subjects who are unable to maintain adequate oral hydration, IV hydration 
of 1.5 to 2 L is recommended in the outpatient setting on Day 1 of 20 mg and

data "cutoff" date for the safety analyses.  Safety Data up to and including this date will 
be collected.  During this data collection period, active subjects will continue to receive venetoclax, as applicable.  When data collection is complete and all data management quality assurance (QA) and quality control (QC) procedures are performed, the clinical 
database data will be extracted for documentati on and statistical analyses.  Any active 
subjects will continue to receive venetoclax until they discontinue or for up to [ADDRESS_525903] discontinues/completes the cohort, the cohort will be 
considered complete, and all remaining data will be collected and entered into the clinical database.  A final safety and efficacy assessment on the subjects treated in the safety expansion cohort will be performed once all subjects have completed/discontinued from the cohort.  No statistical testing procedures will be performed and only descriptive statistics and the 95% confidence interval will be presented.
Overall survival will be collected on all subjects for up to [ADDRESS_525904] been collected and entered into the clinical database, a final analysis will be performed on this dataset.

[IP_ADDRESS] Independent Data Monitoring Committee
Interim analysis results will be reviewed by [CONTACT_416959] [ADDRESS_525906] completed approximately 2 – 3 weeks of the lead-in period in the safety expansion cohort.  
8.2 Determination of Sample Size
Approximately 100 subjects will be enrolled in th e main cohort to assess the safety and 
efficacy of venetoclax in subjects with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic 
leukemia (CLL) harboring the 17p deletion.  With this sample size, if a rare adverse event occurs at a rate of 2%, then the probability of observing at least 1 event in a trial with 100 subjects is 86%.
Assuming a peak enrollment rate of 0.11 subjects/site/month, it is anticipated that 
approximately [ADDRESS_525907] had their 36-week disease assessment.  The final efficacy summary will occur around Month 38 (two years after last subject enrolled).
Overall response rates for CLL subjects with 17p deletion range from approximately 7% 
to 77% with the higher responses in alternati ve but also more toxic regimens such as 
alemtuzumab + steroids.
24  Conventional therapi[INVESTIGATOR_416941], demonstrated 
ORRs of 35% and 7%, respectively.  Therefore, a therapy providing significant benefit in overall response rate over a standard rate of 40% would be considered clinically meaningful.
Performing the efficacy analyses at [ADDRESS_525908] 90% power (at 2-sided 
alpha of 5%) to reject the null hypothesis of 40% ORR in favor of an alternative hypothesis of 60% ORR.  The power calculations for a range of different sample sizes are presented in Table 11.

For the safety expansion cohort, an additional 50 subjects with relapsed/refractory or 
previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) harboring the 17p deletion will be enrolled to assess the modifications made to the initial dosing of venetoclax for the management of TLS.  With this sample size, if a TLS event occurs at a rate of 2%, then the probability of observing at least 1 event in this cohort of 50 subjects is 64%.

institutional standards to ensure emergency dialysis is available) on admission 
for any subject hospi[INVESTIGATOR_416944].
!IV fluids (e.g., D5 1/2 normal saline) should be initiated at a rate of at least 1 mL/kg/hr rounded to the nearest 10 mL (target 150 to 200 mL/hr; not 
< 50 mL/hr).  Modification of fluid rate should also be considered for 
individuals with specific medical needs.
!Monitor for symptoms or signs of TLS (e.g., fever, chills, tachycardia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, diaphoresis, hypotension, muscle aches, weakness, 
paresthesias, mental status changes, confusion and seizures).  If any clinical 
features are observed, recheck potassium, phosphorus, uric acid, calcium and creatinine within 1 hour STAT.
!Vital signs should be taken at time of  all blood draws or any intervention.
!The management recommendations below focus on the minimum initial responses required.  If a diagnosis of TLS is established, ongoing intensive 
monitoring and multi-disciplinary management will be per institutional 
protocols.

and Management of Tumor Lysis Syndrome and Appendix D – Recommendations for Initial Management of Electrolyte Abnormalities and Prevention of Tumor Lysis 
Syndrome (TLS).
c. Assessments will be collected at [ADDRESS_525980] 17p deletion as assessed by [CONTACT_416964].  A result obtained prior to study Screening may be used for 
eligibility.  A confirmatory sample will be sent to central laboratory at Screening.  Refer to Section [IP_ADDRESS], Collection and Handling of Biomarker Variables, for more details.
e. A complete physical examination will be performed at Screening.  A symptom directed physical examination will be performed on Day 1 of Weeks 2 – 4 and the 30-day 
Safety Visit.  All other physical examinations will be targeted.  If during physical examination, signs or symptoms suggestive of Richter's Syndrome are observed, further 
assessments (e.g., lymph node biopsy, PET scan) should be considered to exclude or confirm the transformation.  Refer to Sectio n [IP_ADDRESS] Physical Examination, for more 
details.
f. For females of childbearing potential, a urine pregnancy test must be obtained and processed locally at the Week 1 Day 1, if it has been > 7 days since obtaining the serum 
pregnancy results at Screening.
g. Cholesterol and triglycerides are only required at Screening and Final Visit.
h. There is no 72 hour window for these samples.  Refer to Section 6.8.1, Prophylaxis and Management of Tumor Lysis Syndrome and Appendix D – Recommendations for 
Initial Management of Electrolyte Abnormalities and Prevention of Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS).
i. Assessment of ejection fraction will be made at screening at the discretion of the investigator.  Subsequent evaluation of Le ft Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) will be 
made as clinically indicated for subjects who develop signs of cardiac compromise.
j. If a subject exhibits clinical signs of possible disease progression (i.e., increased or de novo enlargement of liver, spleen or lymph nodes on physical examination without an 
increase in lymphocytes meeting PD criteria), a CT scan and/or bone marrow biopsy must be performed within 2 weeks to confirm o r rule out PD as described in 
Section [IP_ADDRESS].
k. Imaging assessments are required for all subjects at Week 36 Day 1.  Assessment to be performed on Week 36 Day 1 only (not every 12 weeks).  The Week [ADDRESS_525981]'s last scan.
l. After a response is determined by [CONTACT_316316], a CT scan will be performed no earlier than 8 weeks for confirmation of response.  For determination of CR/CRi, both the 
CT scan and bone marrow are required to be negative.  It is recommended that the CT scan is performed first, and if it does confi rm a CR/CRi, then a BM biopsy should be 
obtained as soon as possible.  
m. Post-treatment CT or MRI scans to be done only if collected by [CONTACT_416965]. 
n. A bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_416903] (within [ADDRESS_525982] dose  of study drug).  Bone marrow and aspi[INVESTIGATOR_416904].  Refer to Table 6.

6.1.3 Relationship to Study Drug
The investigator will use the following definitions to assess the relationship of the adverse 
event to the use of study drug:
Reasonable 
PossibilityAfter consideration of factors including timing of the event, 
biologic plausibility, clinical judgment, and potential alternative 
causes, there is sufficient evidence (information) to suggest a 
causal relationship.
No Reasonable PossibilityAfter consideration of factors including timing of the event, 
biologic plausibility, clinical judgment, and potential alternative 
causes, there is insufficient evidence (information) to suggest a 
causal relationship.
For causality assessments, events assessed as having a reasonable possibility of being 
related to the study drug will be considered "associated."  Events assessed as having no reasonable possibility of being related to study drug will be considered "not associated."  In addition, when the investigator has not reported causality or deemed it not assessable,

 Precis e/Abstract:  
 
 
Introduction and Background:  
 
Imaging -based diagnostic tests are routinely used in the clinical management of many medical 
illnesses.  In ischemic heart disease, for example, evaluation of the integrity and caliber of the 
coronary arteries combined with tests of myocardial function are  critical determinants of the 
interventional strategy initiated following the diagnosis of an acute myocardial infarction [1].  The 
decision by a cardiologist to treat medically or surgically is neither arbitrary nor conciliatory. 
Rather, they are based on  objective measurements of the primary organ of interest considered 
in context of other contributing risk factors, including genetics, co -morbid medical conditions 
(i.e., hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035]) life -style factors (smoking, diet, exercise) and past 
cardiac problems.  Currently, the choice of treatment for major depression (MDD) is based on 1) 
trial-and-error, 2) the skills and preferences of the clinician treating the patient (i.e. psychiatrist 
or therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]) who chooses a treatment based on their training and ideology, or 3) patient 
treatment preferences [2].   
 
For a patient presenting with a major depressive epi[INVESTIGATOR_57842] 
(MDD), an antidepressant medication or evidence -based psychotherapy is the recommended 
first-line treatment. However, fewer than 40% of patients achieve remission with any initial 
intervention (monotherapy), and choosing the “wrong” treatment has significant individual and 
societal costs due to continued distress, risk of suicide, loss of prod uctivity, wasted resources, 
and potential unintended neural effects associated with two to three months of an ineffective 
strategy [2]. To minimize these costs and improve the clinical care of patients with MDD, a 
crucial goal is to develop a dependable tr eatment selection algorithm that matches an individual 
patient to the treatment option most likely to be successful. To have meaningful clinical impact, 
such an algorithm must lead to remission rates that exceed the usual 35 -40% commonly 
reported with usua l care. Critically, such an algorithm should select the best treatment while 
also avoiding the worst treatment, and also identify patients that require other alternatives.  
 
In developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a reliable biomarker to guide initial treatment stratification to sta ndard first -line 
treatments such as CBT or sCIT, it is also necessary to differentiate those patients that require 
non-standard treatment options. A 35 -40% non -remission rate is typi[INVESTIGATOR_57843] a 
randomized treatment is followed by a second medicat ion or combination medication and 
psychotherapy. Given that further increases in medical and psychosocial costs are associated 
with two failed standard first -line treatments, it is essential to know in advance if a patient is a 
poor candidate for these usu al options.  
 
We previously conducted a trial of 82 patients with MDD who were randomly assigned to 12 
weeks of treatment with either cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) or the antidepressant 
escitalopram (ESC).  Using a pre -treatment fluorodeoxyglucose pos itron emission tomography 
(FDG -PET) measure of metabolic activity, we found that the ratio of metabolic activity in the 
insula relative to whole brain metabolism predicted remission and non -response to the two 
treatments.  Specifically, patients whose insu la activity was below the whole brain mean were 
highly likely to remit with CBT and have a poor response to ESC.  Conversely, those with 
relatively high insula activity required ESC to remit, and responded poorly to CBT [3]. This 
earlier trial also contain ed an additional 12 -week combination treatment phase for patients who 
did not remit to their original 12 weeks of treatment with ESC or CBT.  In this phase, we found 
that for patients were more likely to achieve remission if their added second treatment (w hether 
Version #4 10 -24-2014  Page 3 of 19 
 
 ESC added to CBT non -remitters, or CBT added to ESC non -remitters) matched the baseline 
insula activity signal predictive of remission [4].  This trial provided the first evidence that a 
biomarker could predict differential outcomes to two contrasti ng treatment approaches for MDD. 
The current study aims to replicate the findings of the earlier trial, with the long -term goal of 
achieving a personalized medicine approach to MDD, in which individual patients receive 
treatments most likely to help them s pecifically, based on their brain activity.

c. Recruitment  
Patients will be recruited through advertisements, media campa igns, and clinician 
referral.   
 
d. Procedures  
Version #[ADDRESS_63150] been answered to their 
satisfaction. A study rater will administer the HAMD to assess depression severity. Patients with 
a HAMD ≥18 will go on to complete the SCID -IV to confirm MDD diagnosis and ensure any 
exclusionary psych iatric diagnosis is not present.  A medical history, physical exam, 
electrocardiogram (EKG), blood tests (15cc for complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic 
panel, thyroid function screen, pregnancy test) and a urinalysis and urine drug screen, will be  
performed to ensure the patient is medically appropriate for the study. An additional 10cc 
plasma tube will be collected for genetics analysis. Additional questionnaires regarding personal 
and family history of depression, smoking history, beliefs about d epression, and concomitant 
medications will be administered.  Patients who meet all inclusion and no exclusion criteria at 
the end of this visit will be scheduled for the Scanning Visit within 10 days.  
 
Questionnaires completed by [CONTACT_57856]:  
 Edinburgh Handedness Scale  
 Hollingshead Scale of Socioeconomic Status  
 Childhood Trauma Questionnaire  
 Patient Attitudes and Beliefs Scale  
 Reasons for Depression Questionnaire  
 MRI Safety Form (Required by [CONTACT_57857])   
 
Scanning Visit   
 This visit will require approximately [ADDRESS_63151] the scans scheduled over a 2 -day period.  The FDG -PET scan will be performe d prior to 
the MRI scan whenever possible.  The Positive and Negative Affective State scale (PANAS) will 
be rated at the beginning and end of each scan to monitor fluctuations over the scanning 
session.  Analogue Mood Scales (10 -point Likert) will be used to rate euthymia, anxiety and 
sadness and the start and finish of each scan.   
 
Baseline Visit  
This visit will require approximately 90 minutes.  Vital signs will be measured and inquiry about 
any concomitant medication changes will be made.  
Patients will be assessed by a trained interviewer with the following instruments:  
 HAMD  
 Montgomery -Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS)  
 Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAM -A) 
 Clinical Global Impression -Severity (CGI -S) scales  
 
Patients will complete the following questionnaires:  
 Beck Depression Inventory -II (BDI -II)  
 Quality of Life, Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire (Q -LES-Q) 
 Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS)  
 Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology -Self Report (QIDS -SR) 
Version #4 10 -24-2014  Page 6 of 19 
 
  Multidimensional Locus of Control Inventory (MLCI)  
 Life Orientation Test – Revised (LOT -R) 
 Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ)  
 Dunlop Emotional Blunting Scale (DEBS)  
 Ruminative Response Scale (RRS)

 Frequency, Intensity and Burden of Side Effects Rat ing (FIBSER)  
 Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ)  
 PROMIS Depression Scale  
 PROMIS Anxiety Scale  
 Body Awareness Questionnaire  
 
Blood will be collected for the following measures:  
 
 Methylation (6cc)  
 Immune measures and metabolomics (10 cc)  
 RNA (6 cc)  
 
Additi onally, study patients will complete an extended vital sign assessment, consisting of  3 
heart measure tasks ( two subjective, one objective):  
 Heart Rate Measure  
 7 Minute Heart Rate Recording Task  
 Affective Bias Task  
 
 
Upon completion of all questionnaires and interviews, the patient will meet with a study 
physician to be informed of their treatment assignment. The study physician will answer any 
questions about the treatment or future study visits.  
 
Phase [ADDRESS_63152] four weeks (Visits 3 -6) and the every other week for 
weeks 5 -12 (Visits 7 -10). These visits will last approximately one hour. Vital signs and changes 
in concomitant medications will be assessed. At each visit, patients will be assessed by [CONTACT_57858], MADRS and HAMA. Patients will complete the BDI -II, QIDS -SR, 
FIBSER and  self -report forms. They will meet with a study physician, who will administer the 
CGI-S and CGI -Improvement (CGI -I) scales. Adverse events will be discussed with the study 
physician, and dosing adjustments, if permitted (see below), will be made.  
 
At the week 6 (Visit 7) visit, patients will also complete the SDS, Q -LES-Q, DEBS and PSQI. 
They will also complete the PROMI S Anxiety and the PROMIS Depression Scale.  
 
At the week 12 visit (visit 10), patients will undergo repeat FDG -PET scanning at the CSI and 
then come to the come to the MAP offices to complete the visit assessments.  In addition to all 
the measures collected at week 6, patients will also complete the Body Awareness 
Questionnaire, PABS, RFDQ, MLCI, LOT -R, RRS, and ERQ.  Blood will also be collected to 
repeat the methylation, immune, metabolomics and RNA measures, as well as to measure 
pharmacokinetic values of escitalopram (10 cc, for total blood volume  draw of 32cc). Total time 
for completion of all components at Visit [ADDRESS_63153] 
Version #[ADDRESS_63154] the week 12 blood draws and questionnaires repeated at week 24.  
 
PHASE 2  
 
Visit procedures in Phase 2 will depend on whether or not the patient remitted (defined below) in 
Phase 1.  
 
Remitters  at the end of Phase 1 will return at monthly intervals to measure their vital signs and 
report concomitant medications, and will c omplete the HAMD, MADRS, HAMA, CGI -S, CGI -I, 
BDI-II and QIDS -SR.  Total time for this visit is about one hour. Patients on escitalopram will 
receive one month’s supply of medication at this visit, and patients receiving CBT will have a 
CBT booster session if they desire it.   
 
Non-Remitters at the end of Phase 1 will enter another 12 week treatment course that replicates 
the treatment course and visit frequency of Phase 1 (see Table 1 ). The only differences from 
Phase 1 are that in Phase 2 there are no PET scans, and the patients continue with their Phase 
1 treatment in addition to starting the Phase 2 treatment (see Study  Treatments , below).   
 
Heart Rate Monitoring  
 
As a potential non -imaging surrogate for insula activity, we will ask patients to count the ir heart 
beats while their actual pulse rate is monitored. A soft tone will indicate the start and end point 
for each counting interval. Actual pulse will be monitored with electrodes on their left and right 
wrists and clavicle. The test will be administer ed at the baseline and week [ADDRESS_63155] time for patients completing the week 24 visit. Subjects will complete the Body 
Awareness Questionnaire each time they perform the heart rate monitoring task.  
 
Heartbeat perception will be measured  using the Mental Tracking Method  [15]. Between onset 
and offset of a soft tone, the subject counts his/her heartbeat by [CONTACT_57859].  The subject is not to take his/her own pulse to try any other physical manipulation, 
which might fa cilitate the detection of heartbeats. The task will be repeated 3 times, for intervals 
lasting 25, 35, and 45 seconds respectively.  After the termination of each perception interval, 
participants will report the counted/estimated number of heartbeats. The  subject will not be 
informed about how many seconds the 3 trials lasted or about their performance.  
 
The following intervals will be used:  
Rest (60 sec); Perception (25 sec)  
Rest (30 sec); Perception (35 sec)  
Rest (30 sec) Perception (45 sec)  
Rest (60 sec) 
 
Stationary objective 7 Minute Heart Rate Recording  
The patient’s heart rate will be recorded for 7 minutes while they sit stationary and look at a 
printed cross on a sheet of paper.  Prior to beginning this recording, patients will be asked to be 
seated for 5 minutes.  
Version #4 10 -24-2014  Page 8 of 19 
 
  
Affective Bias Task  
Participants will be asked to rate the level of emotion o n faces present ed on a computer screen. 
To rate the level of emotional intensity, participants will use the mouse to move a horizontal 
marker on a scale ranging from very sad to very happy. The emotion and intensity portrayed on 
each face will vary for each trail. During t his task, participants’ heart rate will be recorded.

 Brain Imaging Procedures  
 
1.  FDG PET scans   
 
 Regional cerebral glucose metabolism will be measured using a 18F -fluoro -
deoxyglucose method (10 mCi FDG dose/scan; scan duration 60 seconds) [7 -9]. Data will be 
acquired on a Siemens ECAT 921 PET scanner, operating in 3D mode Axial FOV 14.5 cm; 47 
reconstructed slices).  A total of 2 scans (Visit 1 and Visit 10) will be acquired, each lasting 
approximately 90 minutes. For each scan, a 5 mCi dose of 2 -[18F] -fluoro -2-deoxy -D-glucose 
(FDG) will be injected intravenously, with image acquisition beginning after 40 minutes (scan 
duration 20 minutes).  Arterialized -venous blood sampling will be used to calculate absolute 
glucose metabolic rates. All subjects will be scanned during CSI business hours. under identical 
conditions: supi[INVESTIGATOR_050], awake, in the resting state with eyes closed and ears uncovered.  Patients 
will be advised to fast and avoid caffeine for four hours prior to the scan. Patients will be 
checked every ten minutes to ensure  they are not asleep.  Patients will not be explicitly 
instructed to monitor internal mood state or to perform any specific cognitive task.  This 
approach aims to examine regional effects associated with the baseline depressed state without 
the potential i nterpretive confounds introduced by [CONTACT_57860].   A debriefing session will follow the uptake period to document compliance with the 
instructions. PET scans will be performed prior to the fMRI scans.  
 
2.  fMRI Bol d scans  
  
MRI acquisitions will be acquired using a Siemens 3T whole body scanner (Tim Trio) with a 60 
cm diameter bore. The MR imaging protocol includes an (1) anatomic image (7 min), (2) Two 
sets of different phase encoding DTI (16 min) and (3) two sets of resting state functional 
connectivity (15 min) acquisition [12] and a magnetic resonance spectroscopy scan (15 min).  
The anatomic imaging will be conducted for anatomic reference in fMRI and DTI data analysis, 
and volumetric analysis. The DTI images wi ll be used to refine selection of regions -of-interest 
(ROI) for model -based analyses. Positive and negative affect will be assessed using the PANAS 
before and after the scanning session. These measures will be used for correlational analyses 
with brain dat a.   
 
To provide precise anatomical localization of identified functional differences between groups, a 
high-resolution anatomical image of the whole brain will be acquired. High -resolution anatomical 
imaging will be performed with a T1 -weighted MPRAGE seq uence optimized at 3T: 
TE/TR=5/35, matrix=256 x 208 x 196, FOV=256 x 208 x 192 mm2, 1mm isotropic resolution.  
Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) will also be acquired to allow structural connectivity inferences 
between areas identified with the functional ima ges. DTI images will be acquired using diffusion 
weighted single -shot spin echo -planar imaging (EPI) sequence in 66 axial slices covering the 
whole brain (TR/TE=3292/96 ms, matrix=128×128, FOV=256 mm×256 mm, slice thickness=2 
mm; 66 slices, and two opposit e phase encoding directions). Diffusion weighting will be applied 
in 128 directions with a b -value of 1000 s/mm2. Resting BOLD imaging will collect T2* -weighted 
images: [ADDRESS_63156] (orbital frontal, medial 
prefrontal, dorsolateral prefrontal) to investigate areas of known abnormalities in previous PET 
studies.  
 
3. TSB Determination  
Version #[ADDRESS_63157] (237.35 mm3 spherical ROI centered on MNI coordinates x= 
+28.5, y= -21, z= -9) based on the original study findings. Patients with insula metabolism 
higher than thei r WBM (insula/WBM ratio >1) will be assigned to the escitalopram group; 
patients with insula metabolism lower than their WBM (insula/WBM ratio <1) will be assigned to 
the CBT group.  
 
Study Treatments  
 
1. Treatment Assignment for Phase I  
 
 Once the PET scan  data have been analyzed to determine the TSB, patients will return 
for their baseline visit to receive their treatment assignment.  Upon completion of the baseline 
visit study procedures, patients will meet with a study psychiatrist to be informed of thei r 
treatment assignment to escitalopram or CBT.  Importantly, to minimize placebo response 
emerging from expectation bias, and to maximize comparability with our original dataset, 
patients will NOT be informed that they are being treated according to their PET scan result. 
Instead, patients will be informed that while we are studying the utility of imaging to improve 
patient care, they are being randomized to treatment. This will replicate exactly what was done 
in our original study to develop this biomarker . This safeguard is crucial to ensure that any 
increase in remission rates we observe in our trial are the result of matching patients to the 
TSB, and not due to non -specific effects. Assessors administering the clinical rating scales will 
be blind to trea tment group and method of treatment assignment.   
 
2. CBT Treatment  
 
All clinical guidelines for MDD include Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) as a recommended 
treatment. For patients treated with CBT, therapy visits will occur twice weekly for 4 weeks and 
then weekly for weeks 5 -12, for a total of 16 therapy sessions. Using a standardized protocol [5] 
enhanced with behavioral strategies, patients will learn to develop an awareness of how 
attitudes, beliefs or ways of thinking and thoughts produce and mainta in depressed or anxious 
moods.  CBT pursues alleviation of depression through a systematic effort to change depressed 
patients' automatic and maladaptive beliefs or ways of thinking. At the heart of this approach is 
the assumption that distorted beliefs ab out the self, the world, and the future maintain 
depressive affect. Initially, patients focus on becoming aware of these thinking styles, and they 
then learn how to respond to them in ways that are more adaptive. Patients will be asked to 
monitor their tho ughts, attitudes and beliefs, especially those accessed in the midst of 
problematic emotional situations.  During the course of treatment, the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_57844].  
 
 The typi[INVESTIGATOR_57845] 16 -20 sessions (16 planned in this study) and 
the sequence of treatment involves three stages. In t he early stage (sessions 1 -4) the emphasis 
is on establishing a therapeutic relationship with the patient, educating the patient about the 
CBT model and emotional lability, setting goals, and identifying and evaluating automatic 
thoughts. The middle phase (sessions 5 to 12) involves a gradual shift towards the identification 
of dysfunctional beliefs and compensatory strategies the patient may be employing, helpi[INVESTIGATOR_57846]. Tasks in the late stages of CBT (sessions 13 -16) revolve around 
Version #[ADDRESS_63158] 
and client versions, (WAI -T and WAI -C), which mea sure the quality of the therapeutic 
relationship between therapi[INVESTIGATOR_57847], will be completed by [CONTACT_57861][INVESTIGATOR_57848] 2, [ADDRESS_63159] been completed.  
 
 
3.   Escitalopram Treatment  
 Patients assigned to escitalopram  will receive 10 mg/day for the first 3 weeks of 
treatment. Patients who show less than a 50% improvement from their baseline HDRS -[ADDRESS_63160] their dose increased to 20 mg/d. Patients who demonstrated 50% 
improvement at week 3 will b e maintained on the 10 mg/day dose. Any patient who has failed to 
achieve the remission threshold (HDRS -17 ≤ 7) by [CONTACT_5875] [ADDRESS_63161] their dose increased to 20 
mg/day at the week 6 visit. Patients unable to tolerate 20 mg/d will be down -titrated to 10 
mg/da y. The escitalopram dose will not be changed during the last four weeks of each the 
treatment phase (week 8 in phase I, or week 20 in Phase II). Patients unable to tolerate 10 mg/d 
will be discontinued from the trial. This approach to dosing will ensure al l escitalopram -treated 
patients are either treated to remission or receive at least 6 weeks at the 20 mg/day (or 
maximally tolerated dose), which is identical to the dosing schedule we used in our initial study. 
Side effects will be monitored at every stud y visit.  
 
4. Phase II Treatment  
a. Remitters  
Remitters in Phase I (defined below) will return at weeks 16, 20 and 24 during Phase II for 
ongoing monitoring of symptoms. Patients remitting with escitalopram will continue to receive 
that medication; CBT-remitters will receive 3 therapy booster sessions at monthly intervals.  All 
remitters will complete the following procedures at each of these three visits:  
 Vital signs  
 HAMD, MADRS, HAMA, and CGI assessments  
 QIDS -SR, BDI -II, FIBSER, and SDS questionnai res 
b. Non -Remitters  
Patients who do not meet the remission criteria at week [ADDRESS_63162] will be available by [CONTACT_57862].   
 
5. Early Termin ating Patients  
Version #4 10 -24-2014  Page 13 of 19 
 
 Patients who terminate their participation prior to week 12 in Phase I will complete the week 12 
assessments (with the exception of the PET scan).  Patients who terminate the trial early in 
Phase II will complete the week [ADDRESS_63163] the patient in order to determine why the 
patient failed to return.  
 
6. Patient Instructions  
 
 Each patient will be advised of the importance of treatment adherence.  For patients on 
escitalopram, pi[INVESTIGATOR_57849]. A missed 
dose may be taken within the same day. A missed dose the previous day should not be made -
up (i.e. doubled) the next day. If the patient has any questions about the study or other 
medications, the r esearch physician may be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530], if necessary through a [ADDRESS_63164] -study follow -up 
 
 To ensure that study participants are saf ely transitioned to alternative sources of care, 
the study physicians will offer additional brief visits as needed for up to one month following the 
patient’s completion of study participation. No additional research data will be collected at these 
visits.  The visits will be conducted as standard of care visits until the patient’s care has been 
transferred to another clinician.   
 
8. Treatment Adherence and Rater Reliability   
 
As in our first study, we will ensure that the treatments delivered in this study adhere to their 
respective treatment protocols, using standard measures for pharmacotherapy and CBT, 
respectively. Medication adherence will be monitored using pi[INVESTIGATOR_57850] 12 and 24 for patients receiving escital opram. CBT competence will be 
assessed by [CONTACT_57863], PhD using the Cognitive Therapy Scale (CTS) [6] to rate a randomly 
selected sample (15%) of video recordings from each treatment, blocked on early, middle and 
late phases of intervention. Ongoing reli ability data will be gathered for rating scales. New 
clinicians joining the treatment team will go through MAP’s standard apprenticeship for the 
ratings and special training for reliability prior to performing independent ratings.  
 
IV. Data Analyses  
 
A.   Treatment Response Assessments  
 
Definitions.  
Remission  (RR) is categorically defined as a final score on the HAM -D scale for the week 10 
and 12 visits (which are separated by 2 weeks) of less than 8.  
Response  (R) is defined as 50% reduction from baseline and a final score <15 at the week 10 
and 12 visits.  
Non-response  (NR) is defined as a <30% improvement in HAM -D score from baseline to week 
12.  For non -remitters in phase II, NR is defined as failure to as a <30% improvement in HAM -D 
score from baseline t o week 24.  
Version #[ADDRESS_63165] treatment will be tested in this protocol 
using Simon’s ‘two -stage’ design [7] using exact binomial calculations. Simon’s two -stage 
design is c ommonly used for testing treatment stratification biomarkers; for example, for 
estimating remission rates of different established cancer treatments [8]. For the insula TSB 
being tested here, if the overall remission rate is below the threshold set for the  first stage (see 
sample size in the next 2 paragraphs), then TSB -based assignment will be halted and treatment 
switched to assignment by [CONTACT_57864].  
 
Sample size for this design is determined by [CONTACT_57865] l evel at which we 
will consider the remission rate a failure. For our purposes, we set the threshold level to a 
remission rate of 35%, which is roughly equivalent to the remission rate expected from 
randomized or naturalistic treatment in depression [9 -11].The sample size is then calculated by 
[CONTACT_57866] I error=0.05, the minimum acceptable target level of remission (in this case, 
50% or a 15% increase in remission rate over threshold level) and the Type II error (beta=0.2 or 
power=0.80).  
 
With these  parameters, the total sample size needed for the first stage of the Simon’s 2 -
stage design is n=27 completers with 12 weeks of treatment. If 10 or more of those 27 subjects 
remit (i.e. 37%), the design will continue to stage 2 using the “treat by [CONTACT_57867] t ype” paradigm. 
The continuation will then require an additional [ADDRESS_63166] 27 subjects remit, the trial will revert to 
randomized treatment allocation in order to complete data collection. This futility design ensures 
that we don’t continue to treat by [CONTACT_57868] 50% target remission rate in the 
full sample. At minimum, we require 77 subjects to complete all 12 weeks (i.e. have remission 
status) in order to test the efficacy of the biomarker to assign best treatment. If we allow for a 
20% dropout rate, which is consistent with our earlier trial, we  will need to recruit a total of 96 
(approximately 100) subjects at baseline.  
 
Aim 2   
Given the expected 77 completers of the initial treatment phase and the projected 50% 
remission rate, we will have approximately 40 subjects enter the second 12 -week (combined) 
treatment phase, and based on our original sample,16 will be non -responders (du al failures). 
Evidence from the original study points to several candidate dual -failure biomarkers significant 
at the 0.005 corrected level with a sample size as small as 11 (computed effect size range [1.2 
to 1.8]). We expect to have enough data from this  study to define the dual failure biomarker as 
described.  
 
Heart rate accuracy analysis  
Formula for heartbeat perception score: Mean score across 3 heartbeat perception interactions 
as follows (direction of error is ignored)  
 
1/3∑ (1- (|recorded heartbeats  – counted heartbeats|)/recorded heartbeats)  
 
Scores vary from 0 to 1, with high scores indicating only small differences between recorded 
and counted heartbeats.  
Version #[ADDRESS_63167] will 
be pursued for this study.  
 The main potential risk of a PET scan is exposure to low dose radiation.  Based on 
published dosimetry, the tota l effective dose equivalent for 2 FDG PET scans (10mCi/scan= 
20mCi/study) is 17.[ADDRESS_63168] or future benefits  
Version #[ADDRESS_63169] are currently trained on the scales used.  
New staff involved in patient assessment will be trained in scale a dministration according to the 
MAP’s usual training methods.  
 
Confidentiality  
 
 Patients’ confidentiality will be maintained throughout the duration of their study 
participation. Patient names and other identifiers will not be included in assessment tools  and 
datasets; a unique ID will be assigned. Patient files will be kept in locked offices, and the 
computerized data is kept on password -protected computers in the locked Mood and Anxiety 
Disorders Program offices.  
 
Informed consent  
 
 At the screening visi t, patients will be provided with an informed consent form that will 
outline the risks and benefits of participating in this study.  It will also outline which assessments 
occur at the various study visits.    
 
Deception  
  
Deception is a crucial and necess ary component for this project.  A major confounder of trials 
studying treatments for depression is the placebo response. Although placebo response has 
many sources, a major driver is the expectation of improvement, which can be enhanced by [CONTACT_57869][INVESTIGATOR_57851] [12 -14].  In 
this study we are using FDG -PET scans to assign patients to the specific treatment they will 
receive. We need to tell participants that their treatment is being randomly assi gned to minimize 
the added expectation -effect on placebo response that would result from being told a new 
technology was guiding their treatment decision.  It is important to understand that we do not 
know if this approach really is superior to randomized treatment – this study is designed as a 
proof of principle study, with the outcome being that if we achieve greater than 50% remission 
rates, this will reflect preliminary prospective proof of the method.  If we were to achieve those 
high remission rates t hrough exaggerated placebo responding, the point of the study would be 
undermined, and future resources inappropriately directed.  There are currently no methods to 
select best treatments for individual patients in clinical use.  Therefore, withholding the  
information about how treatment in this study is assigned does not represent a compromise of 
usual clinical care.  We have no evidence or reason to suspect that the PET scan -indicated 
treatment is likely to be worse than randomized treatment assignment. T hus, there are no 
anticipated harms to participants that would result from this deception; all participants will 
receive a standard -of-care treatment for depression, either evidence -based psychotherapy or 
medication. In order to prevent information about t he trial design from disseminating into the 
general public, we will not debrief patients about the deception at the end of the trial. Because

 If new findings emerge regarding risks or benefits of the study medications used in our 
study, patients will be informed of this information as soon as possible and reminded of their 
ability to continue participation in the study at their own will.   
 
Data and safety monitoring plan (DSMP)  
 
 The proposed study is most appropriately considered the eq uivalent of a Phase IV 
clinical trial. The Departments of Psychiatry and Neurology Data Safety Monitoring Board will 
provide annual review of the safety and confidentiality components of the study. All serious 
adverse events will be reported to the DSMB wi thin [ADDRESS_63171] -protected computers, stored in the MAP offices.

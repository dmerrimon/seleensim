Haider, MD, MPH  PROTOCOL TITLE The Provider Awareness and Cultural Dexterity Toolkit for Surgeons (PACTS) Trial  FUNDING  1R01MD011685-01A1  VERSION DATE  September 18, [ADDRESS_1274028] been well-documented. In response to the IOM’s [ADDRESS_1274029] of this new curriculum, called Provider Awareness Cultural Dexterity Toolkit for Surgeons (PACTS), on surgical residents’ cross-cultural knowledge, attitudes, and skills surrounding the care of diverse patients, as well as patient-reported and clinical outcomes for patients treated by [CONTACT_907640].     1. Aim 1: Evaluate the impact of PACTS on surgical residents’ knowledge and attitudes about caring for culturally diverse patients using a pre-and post-assessment.   Hypothesis 1: Residents receiving PACTS will show greater improvement in knowledge and attitudes compared to those who did not.      2. Aim 2:  Determine the impact of PACTS on surgical residents’ cross-cultural skills as demonstrated in a simulated clinical setting, using an Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) and by [CONTACT_6270]-report.  Each OSCE station will assess one of the four core topi[INVESTIGATOR_907622].   
Partners Human Subjects Research Application Form   Filename: [CONTACT_392705]:  October 15, 2014    2  Hypothesis 2: Residents receiving PACTS will demonstrate greater improvements in cross-cultural skills.   3. Aim 3:  Assess effectiveness of PACTS on improving clinical outcomes and patient-reported outcomes.  We will survey patients cared for by [CONTACT_907641]: (1) satisfaction with pain management, (2) physician communication, (3) trust and (4) comprehension of informed consent.  In addition, we will use data from the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) to measure surgical complications, length of stay, 30-day mortality, morbidity, and readmissions for all patients.  Hypothesis 3: Patients cared for by [CONTACT_907642]-reported outcomes.  BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE Provide a brief paragraph summarizing prior experience important for understanding the proposed study and procedures.  Minority patients experience worse overall health outcomes, and these disparities are especially apparent in the costly, high-risk specialty of surgical care. To address this, the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities (NIMHD) collaborated with the American College of Surgeons (ACS) to establish research priorities for surgical disparities. One of the top priorities was to evaluate the effect of improvement in culturally dexterous care on surgical outcomes for patients from disparity populations. Adverse outcomes for minority patients, including patients with limited English proficiency, have been demonstrated because of poor patient-provider communication. We propose that such deficiencies in communication contribute to treatment errors, inadequate pain management, less patient-centered care, decreased adherence to treatment plans, and worse overall clinical outcomes. Additionally, studies have illustrated the preponderance of pro-White implicit biases, which are unconscious, automated preferences that individuals may not even be aware of, among surgeons.   Formal training in cultural competency is generally integrated in the undergraduate medical education curricula, but this training rarely continues into specialty-specific post-graduate training. Few surgical programs have attempted to incorporate cross-cultural communication skills into their educational paradigms, and the approaches to doing so have been inconsistent. Our examination revealed that these programs’ success was limited by a lack of specificity to the surgical context, as well as diminished applicability of the concepts to real-life practice. Therefore, we adapted a novel approach to cross-cultural communication for surgical trainees, known as cultural dexterity. Cultural dexterity refers to a set of skills and cognitive practices used to maximize communication across multiple dimensions of 
Partners Human Subjects Research Application Form   Filename: [CONTACT_392705]:  October 15, 2014    3  cultural diversity, and deviates from the concept of cultural competency in that it does not demand that learners associate certain practices and behaviors with individuals based on generalizations. Our cultural dexterity curriculum, known as PACTS (Provider Awareness Cultural Dexterity Toolkit for Surgeons) focuses on developi[INVESTIGATOR_907623]’ needs to ensure personal, patient-centered surgical care. Experts in education and cross-cultural communication were convened, along with patient advocates and representatives, to inform the conceptual development of our curriculum. The curriculum is comprised of four educational modules on establishing trust in the physician-patient relationship, communicating effectively with patients with limited English proficiency, discussing informed consent, and issues surrounding pain management. Each module consists of an independent learning activity, an interactive role-play, and a post-lesson assessment. Cumulative evaluation of learners’ knowledge, attitudes, and skills will take place after all four modules have been completed. Assessment tools are outcome measures are described in further detail below.   In anticipation of this protocol, we have pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268]-tested the curriculum at three affiliated institutions with general surgery residents at varying levels of training. Focus group data was collected to garner feedback on the effectiveness and feasibility of the curriculum. The purpose of the current protocol is to implement the curriculum across eight institutions and measure resident-level competency outcomes, as well as patient-reported and clinical outcomes, following this training.    RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Briefly describe study design and anticipated enrollment, i.e., number of subjects to be enrolled by [CONTACT_17839]-wide and by [CONTACT_17840].  Provide a brief summary of the eligibility criteria (for example, age range, gender, medical condition).  Include any local site restrictions, for example, “Enrollment at Partners will be limited to adults although the sponsor’s protocol is open to both children and adults.” We will conduct a cross-over, cluster-randomized trial at 8 academic medical centers (AMCs) to capture the effect of PACTS on: 1) resident knowledge and attitudes regarding  cross-cultural  health  care  [Specific  Aim  (SA)1],  2)  interpersonal  and  communication  skills  in  simulated  patient-clinician  encounters  [SA2],  and  3)  patient-reported  satisfaction  with  resident  physicians  involved  in  their  care,  and  clinical  outcomes  [SA3].  Sites will be assigned to an early intervention/retention assessment group or a control group with delayed intervention for examination of the effectiveness of the intervention as well as learner retention.  After cluster-randomization, we will assess the residents’ knowledge, attitudes, and skills prior to and after the PACTS curriculum at half the sites (Early Intervention/Retention Group). We plan to conduct follow-up testing after one year to evaluate learner retention.  
Partners Human Subjects Research Application Form   Filename: [CONTACT_392705]:  October 15, 2014    4   At the other sites (Delayed Intervention Group), we will conduct baseline testing prior to the standard residency curriculum, and administer the PACTS curriculum the following year. This study design will enable us to examine both between- and within-group differences based on curriculum exposure in intervention year [ADDRESS_1274030] been matched to achieve balanced cohorts in terms of program size and diversity of patient population. Based on case mix, we anticipate approximately 40% of the patient population in this study will be of minority descent. The eight programs that will be participating in this study are: 1) Johns Hopkins University, 2) Brigham and Women’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], 3) Brown University, 4) Eastern Virginia Medical School, 5) [LOCATION_005] General Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], 6) Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, 7) Howard University, and  8) Washington University in St. Louis.    Briefly describe study procedures.  Include any local site restrictions, for example, “Subjects enrolled at Partners will not participate in the pharmacokinetic portion of the study.”  Describe study endpoints. Surgery Focus Group   In anticipation of the implementation of the cross-over, cluster-randomized trial at the [ADDRESS_1274031] opportunity to gain insight regarding the current curriculum content as well as curriculum implementation. Contributions from surgical residents, medical students, and surgical faculty will be important to supplement the previous input from surgical faculty and program directors.   We plan to recruit participants from the surgical specialty excluding those from our 8 academic medical centers. We will disseminate one of four modules of the curriculum in advance for review. Participants will then be scheduled for a 1 hour-long focus group based on their availability, with a total of four focus groups. Focus groups will be facilitated by [CONTACT_907643] a semi-structured focus group model. We believe this input will be integral in ensuring that our cultural dexterity curriculum can eventually be implemented in all surgical training programs across the country.  
Partners Human Subjects Research Application Form   Filename: [CONTACT_392705]:  October 15, 2014    5   Patients Focus Group  Patient advisors will be recruited through Brigham and Women’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_907624]. This will consist of [ADDRESS_1274032]-building, and comprehension of the informed consent.  Residents  The curriculum incorporates contemporary learning practices such as the “flipped classroom” model, team-based learning, and independent study that have been studied in undergraduate medical education but have not yet been examined in the graduate medical education setting. It consists of a 30-minute e-learning module that is accessed via secure login on personal computers, smart phones, or tablets. The module is built in the Werkz platform and hosted on participating institutions’ servers. Following completion of e-learning modules, learners will attend interactive sessions in which residents will apply concepts from the e-learning to role-play scenarios constructed in a team-based learning format. Residents will be given detailed, scripted prompts for the role-play sessions, for which they will be divided into small groups. Structured feedback will be solicited from peers and facilitators. The group will reconvene for discussion and reflection at the end of the session. During the delivery of the curriculum, residents will also be provided opportunities for spaced-learning in the form of multiple choice questions based on the curriculum emailed through the REDCap system.   To evaluate the impact of PACTS on surgical residents’ knowledge and attitudes about caring for diverse patients, we will use a pre- and post-test in the form of validated instruments that assess knowledge, attitudes, and self-reported skills on a Likert-type scale. This pre- and post-test will be pi[INVESTIGATOR_155923] a group of surgical residents (N=40) to assess the survey length and clarity of questions. Residents will be recruited using a convenience sampling method from those who participated in the surgery focus groups at ASC 2019. Exclusion criteria from this pi[INVESTIGATOR_907625].   Resident skills will also be objectively assessed through an Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) that will be created by [CONTACT_907644]: Protocol Summary Version Date:  October 15, [ADDRESS_1274033] also developed a novel survey instrument to assess resident knowledge, attitudes, and self-reported skills. This instrument is adapted from pre-existing, validated instruments such as the Cultural Competence Health Practitioner Assessment (CCHPA), developed by [CONTACT_907645], and modified to be relevant to surgical training and practice. Residents will be required to take a knowledge survey before and after receiving the PACTS curriculum or standard training. Attitudes regarding the importance of facing cross-cultural health care situations will be assessed across multiple domains using a novel survey instrument that is based on a survey that was used in a similar curriculum aimed at medical students, as well as the Values and Belief Systems domain.   Patients  To evaluate patients’ satisfaction and clinical quality related to PACTS training, we will employ research assistants to administer surveys to patients treated by [CONTACT_907646], communication, trust-building, and comprehension of the informed consent discussion two months before and after the intervention is implemented. Patient satisfaction will be assessed using elements of the validated Pain Treatment Satisfaction Scale (PTSS). Patients will complete this survey privately after a brief explanation and informed consent from the research assistant. Patients will be asked to provide their self-reported race/ethnicity. Finally, clinical surgical outcomes obtained from the NSQIP database and/or electronic health record will be assessed for each patient participant before and after the PACTS curriculum is implemented to measure individual outcomes such as length of stay, postoperative complications, unplanned reoperations, and 30-day morbidity/mortality. The survey will be translated into 5 additional languages (Spanish, Portuguese, Haitian Creole, Simplified Chinese, and Traditional Chinese) in order to ensure a representative patient sample from diverse groups of patients. This survey will be pi[INVESTIGATOR_31219] (N=10) from Partners sites using a convenience sampling method to assess the length of time required for survey completion and clarity of questions.  Resident Curriculum Impact Focus Groups 
Partners Human Subjects Research Application Form   Filename: [CONTACT_392705]:  October 15, [ADDRESS_1274034] opportunity to gain insight regarding how the current curriculum content has impacted the care they provide their patients.  Focus group participants will be recruited from current PACTS participants. Two focus groups will be conducted at each PACTS site, with 8-10 participants in each focus group. Focus groups will be facilitated by [CONTACT_216254] a semi-structured focus group model.  PACTS Program/ Curriculum Evaluation  In order to assess the components of the curriculum by [CONTACT_907647]. The program evaluation will provide feedback based on a 5-point Likert scale questions to rate components of the curriculum. The residents will also have open-ended questions to provide any additional comments or suggestions on the curriculum.    For studies involving treatment or diagnosis, provide information about standard of care at Partners (e.g., BWH, MGH) and indicate how the study procedures differ from standard care.  Provide information on available alternative treatments, procedures, or methods of diagnosis.  Currently, there is no standard for cultural dexterity training among surgical residents. The ACGME identifies core competencies, two of which address cross-cultural communication and patient-centered care, but these do not correspond to standardized educational curricula across residency programs.   Describe how risks to subjects are minimized, for example, by [CONTACT_17842].  To minimize risk, such as the risk of residency program directors learning of individual residents’ scores or of residents learning of patients’ individual evaluations of their communication skills, all participants will be assigned a unique, de-identified study ID number. Only the study ID will be used on surveys and outcomes assessments.    Describe explicitly the methods for ensuring the safety of subjects.  Provide objective criteria for removing a subject from the study, for example, objective criteria for worsening disease/lack of 
Partners Human Subjects Research Application Form   Filename: [CONTACT_392705]:  October 15, 2014    8  improvement and/or unacceptable adverse events.  The inclusion of objective drop criteria is especially important in studies designed with placebo control groups. The focus groups will be recorded through digital voice recorders or conducted via secured virtual web-based video conference software. After the focus groups, the recordings will be stored securely within the Center for Surgery and Public Health and transcribed by [CONTACT_200252]. All patient and resident data will be de-identified.   All patient information will be completely de-identified and the research assistant administering the survey will not be permitted to share information about patients’ participation in the trial with the resident subjects providing their care, to protect patients against potential differential treatment based on their participation or lack thereof in the study.   Similarly, information about resident participation will not be shared with the residency program directors, and residents’ performances on assessment measures will be removed of any potential identifying information such that these performance evaluations will not be factored into the residents’ overall performance in their residency training program. Furthermore, though the curriculum will be delivered as part of all general surgery residents’ didactic training, the research team will explain that participation in the study is entirely voluntary and declining to participate will have no bearing on residents’ status within their program. To protect against risk of program directors learning of individual residents’ scores or residents learning of patients’ individual responses, all participants will be assigned a unique study ID. Only the study ID will be used on surveys and outcomes measures.   FORESEEABLE RISKS AND DISCOMFORTS Provide a brief description of any foreseeable risks and discomforts to subjects.  Include those related to drugs/devices/procedures being studied and/or administered/performed solely for research purposes.  In addition, include psychosocial risks, and risks related to privacy and confidentiality.  When applicable, describe risks to a developi[INVESTIGATOR_17779]. The study poses low risk to residents and patients. Participants in the focus groups may feel nervous sharing their opi[INVESTIGATOR_6153]. We will ensure that all participants know that they do not need to share anything in the focus groups that they are uncomfortable with. For surgical residents, they may experience nervousness or concern knowing that their clinical interactions are being monitored and assessed; however, we will assure them that their individual performance will remain unknown to anyone at their site and therefore will not impact their performance in residency. For patients, they may experience minor psychological distress while participating in the study 
Partners Human Subjects Research Application Form   Filename: [CONTACT_392705]:  October 15, 2014    9  in the setting of acute illness. However, the research assistants will be instructed to screen patients for physical and mental fitness prior to beginning the survey. Research assistants will also stop the survey if the patient demonstrates or verbalizes any distress. Patients may also be concerned about their negative responses impacting their care. To address this, we will try to focus on patients who are approaching discharge and assure all patients that their individual responses will not be shared with their care team.  EXPECTED BENEFITS Describe both the expected benefits to individual subjects participating in the research and the importance of the knowledge that may reasonably be expected to result from the study.  Provide a brief, realistic summary of potential benefits to subjects, for example, “It is hoped that the treatment will result in a partial reduction in tumor size in at least 25% of the enrolled subjects.”  Indicate how the results of the study will benefit future patients with the disease/condition being studied and/or society, e.g., through increased knowledge of human physiology or behavior, improved safety, or technological advances.   The research will benefit residents by [CONTACT_907648]. It could also benefit patients by [CONTACT_819557][INVESTIGATOR_907626], work with medical interpreters, and facilitate informed patient-centered care. The research will also benefit future surgical residents who will undergo this type of training, as well as future patients who will be cared for by [CONTACT_907649]. The anticipated benefits outweigh the low potential risks of this study.    EQUITABLE SELECTION OF SUBJECTS The risks and benefits of the research must be fairly distributed among the populations that stand to benefit from it.  No group of persons, for example, men, women, pregnant women, children, and minorities, should be categorically excluded from the research without a good scientific or ethical reason to do so.  Please provide the basis for concluding that the study population is representative of the population that stands to potentially benefit from this research. Four populations of human subjects will be involved in this study: 1) surgical residents (clinical post-graduate years 1-5) from the 8 academic medical centers, 2) patients treated by [CONTACT_907650], 3) surgical residents outside of the 8 academic medical centers who will participate in focus groups and survey pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], and 4) previous or current nonsurgical patients prior to the implementation of the PACTS curriculum who will participate in the patient focus group and patient survey pi[INVESTIGATOR_48409].

 Surgical residents: All residents at each study site will receive the educational intervention. Enrollment and consent will be discussed by [CONTACT_17033], and program directors will not have access to resident enrollment information. We anticipate enrolling [ADDRESS_1274035] the following racial composition based on average racial composition of surgical residency programs as reported by [CONTACT_907651] (ACGME): 55% White, 6% Black, 7% Hispanic, 19% Asian/Pacific Islander, <1% Native American, and 12% other.1 They will range in age from 25 to 36. Based on the ACGME reports, approximately 33% of these residents will be female, and resident subjects will not be excluded from the study based on their gender.  Patients: We will recruit 3,[ADDRESS_1274036] be admitted to a surgical service under the care of a resident enrolled in the study, able to recognize a photo of the resident as a main care provider, fluent in English, Spanish, Portuguese, Haitian Creole, Simplified Chinese, or Traditional Chinese, and older than 18 years of age.

We will identify patients using the patient list from each resident enrolled in the study during the 2-month pre- and post- data collection windows. We are targeting underrepresented minority patients because they are at most risk for poor communication with providers and such interactions have greater potential for improvements.            White patients will not be excluded from the study; the emphasis is on racially discordant physician/patient dyads, and white patients will be included for the assessment of non-white resident subjects. As we expect that the gender demographics of the patient subject group will somewhat reflect the gender demographics of the general population, we anticipate 50% of the patient subjects to be female. There will be no exclusion of subjects based on gender or ethnicity.  Residents and patients will be recruited from 8 sites: Brigham and Women’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, [LOCATION_005] General Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], Brown University, Howard University, Johns Hopkins University, Eastern Virginia Medical School, and Washington University in St. Louis. Each of these sites is in or near a major metropolitan area, with racially and ethnically diverse patient populations. Research assistants at each site will have access to each resident subject’s panel of inpatients, which will also allow the research assistant to identify the patients’ racial information and proximity to discharge from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. For the Residents Curriculum Impact Focus Groups, the residents will be recruited from the residents already consented and enrolled in the trial. The PACTS Program/ Curriculum Evaluation will be provided to all residents who have undergone the curriculum.   Focus group participants outside of the 8 AMCs  Participants will be recruited for focus group and survey recruitment outside of the 8 AMCs participating in the trial. Individuals will be recruited from a random sample of academic medical centers without any emphasis or exclusion criteria on any specific gender, race, or ethnicity. As such, this should allow for a fairly representative sample. The goal will be to recruit 40 total participants for the focus groups at each academic conference.   Participants will also be asked to pi[INVESTIGATOR_907627] a convenience sampling method based on focus group participation.  Previous or current patients prior to the implementation of the PACTS curriculum  
Partners Human Subjects Research Application Form   Filename: [CONTACT_392705]:  October 15, 2014    12  These patient advisors for the focus groups will be recruited from a random sample through Brigham and Women’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_907628], race, or ethnicity. As such, this should allow for a fairly representative sample. The goal is to recruit [ADDRESS_1274038] 40% Black and Hispanic patients. The language requirement is needed to ensure that the instruments and survey tools are accurately conveyed.  For guidance, refer to the following Partners policy:           Obtaining and Documenting Informed Consent of Subjects who do not Speak English          https://partnershealthcare-public.sharepoint.com/ClinicalResearch/Non-English_Speaking_Subjects.1.10.pdf   RECRUITMENT PROCEDURES Explain in detail the specific methodology that will be used to recruit subjects.  Specifically address how, when, where and by [CONTACT_17843].  Include any specific recruitment methods used to enhance recruitment of women and minorities. Surgery Focus Group Recruitment   Participants will be recruited using a convenience sampling method. Trial investigators will reach out to residency program directors at organizations not participating in the trial to ask that an information sheet be shared with medical students, surgical residents, or surgical faculty. Individuals will be able to register to participate in a focus group online and will be provided with provided additional information about the focus group and scheduling information at that time. In addition, twitter may be used to recruit participants at a specific conference or event by [CONTACT_907652] a broad audience of attendees and providing the online registration information.  Resident Survey Pi[INVESTIGATOR_907629]: Protocol Summary Version Date:  October 15, [ADDRESS_1274039] in trial. The patient advisors will be recruited through Brigham and Women’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_907630].   Patient Survey Pi[INVESTIGATOR_907631]. Additional patients may be recruited from a convenience sampling from the Patient Family Advisory Council. These patient advisors are current or previous patients who have demonstrated an interest in trial. The patient advisors will be recruited through Brigham and Women’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_907632].  Resident Recruitment  All general surgery residents will receive the educational curriculum; each site’s Program Director (PD) has agreed to schedule PACTS training during compulsory didactic sessions, when residents are free from clinical duties. However, participation in study assessments (OSCEs and knowledge-testing) is voluntary and will not impact residents’ performance in their program. Final analyses will include enrolled residents regardless of their attendance in live modules, reflecting an “intention-to-treat” analysis approach.  This will more accurately demonstrate the “real world” benefit of PACTS, as not all residents may be able or willing to attend all live sessions.  Based on the size of the residency programs, which ranges between [ADDRESS_1274040] to enroll 200 residents per arm for analysis (an average of 50 residents per site).      Patient Recruitment  At the onset of clinical rotations, the Program Manager will contact [CONTACT_907653]. The Program Manager will identify the dates and times of resident study participants’ rotations. On these dates and times, Research Assistants working under the supervision of the Program Manager will verify that the resident is on rotation and use the EHR at the surgical service site to 
Partners Human Subjects Research Application Form   Filename: [CONTACT_392705]:  October 15, [ADDRESS_1274041], the RA will approach the patients’ nurse and ask whether the nurse might have a concern regarding the selected patients’ cognitive status. If the nurse has no concerns, the nurse will be asked to introduce study staff to the patient. Staff will provide an information sheet, describe the study, and ask them to identify a resident participating in the PACTS trial who they recall interacting with. The RA will explain the study and provide the patient with a copy of the Patient Information Sheet and survey, which will be administered via tablet or laptop computer to access the survey in the Partners-hosted REDCap database. Completion of the English or Spanish language survey will indicate consent to participate in the study and the patient will be enrolled.  If the nurse has a concern, the nurse will be asked to introduce the RA will approach the patient, and the RA will assess interest in the study, and administer a validated cognitive impairment screening tool (e.g. the Brief Confusion Assessment Method or the 4AT). If the patient is not interested in participating in the study or has a positive screen for cognitive impairment, the RA will not enroll the patient. If the patient does not screen positive, they will then be showed the pi[INVESTIGATOR_907633].  Please see the Patient Recruitment Flowchart in the attachments for an overview.  Patient inclusion criteria are: (1) admitted to surgical service under care of a participating resident; (2) able to recognize resident as a main care provider from a photo; (3) fluent in English, Spanish, Portuguese, Haitian Creole, Simplified Chinese, or Traditional Chinese. Patient exclusion criteria are: (1) admitted to Intensive Care; (2) mentally impaired and/or not oriented to person/time/ place.  In total, we will enroll 3105 patients across all sites (Table 7). If the patient is ineligible or unwilling to participate, another patient will be randomly selected from the e-mail list of patients.  Patient sampling will be such that 40% of included patients will be racial or ethnic minorities. The overall proportion of racial/ethnic minority patients at each institution ranges from 24%-47% (excluding Howard University which has 90%), suggesting sufficient diversity across sites.  Patient populations in surgical service will likely be even more diverse, as this includes both emergency surgery and trauma patients.   Provide details of remuneration, when applicable.  Even when subjects may derive medical benefit from participation, it is often the case that extra hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6042], meals at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], parking fees or other inconveniences will result in additional out-of-pocket expenses related to

The virtual focus group data will be recorded and saved digitally on a Mass General Brigham encrypted computer and stored in a secure, password-protected database.  Data collection and monitoring will be coordinated across the 8 AMCs through a multimedia approach. Video teleconferencing will be utilized and a 
Partners Human Subjects Research Application Form   Filename: [CONTACT_392705]:  October 15, 2014    18  website will be created to ensure smooth coordination and scheduling of the PACTS curriculum across the sites. Each site investigator will be responsible for managing research assistants and data collection at their institution. Survey data (such as patient surveys, resident pre- and post-tests, and OSCCE scoring) will be collected via a Partners-hosted REDCap survey. Data will be stored in a secure location at each AMC and will be accessed by [CONTACT_17033], who will be trained to enter the de-identified data into the secure, password-protected database. The Project Director will have access to the unique IDs assigned to the subjects, but the individual site co-investigators will not. There are no anticipated limitations to confidentiality.  For guidance, refer to the following Partners policies:           Data and Safety Monitoring Plans and Quality Assurance            https://partnershealthcare-public.sharepoint.com/ClinicalResearch/DSMP_in_Human_Subjects_Research.pdf                      Reporting Unanticipated Problems (including Adverse Events)          https://partnershealthcare-public.sharepoint.com/ClinicalResearch/Reporting_Unanticipated_Problems_including_Adverse_Events.pdf   PRIVACY AND CONFIDENTIALITY Describe methods used to protect the privacy of subjects and maintain confidentiality of data collected.

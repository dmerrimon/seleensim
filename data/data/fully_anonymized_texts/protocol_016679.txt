 3 BACKGROUND  
 
 
Pelvic organ prolapse (POP) is a growing concern for the aging fema le 
population, and symptomatic women often require surgical intervention. Approx imately 
200,000  surgical procedures for POP are performed annually in the [LOCATION_002]. T his 
number is anticipated to increase with the growth in the aging population.1 Surgical 
prolapse repairs are often categorized into either mesh augmented or  native tissue repairs. 
During a native tissue repair, the surgeon uses a woman’s natural ti ssue to repair the 
prolapse without augmenting the repair with synthetic mesh.  
Women often have post-operative pain with native tissue posterior colporr haphy.2 
Native tissue posterior repairs are performed to address symptom atic posterior 
compartment prolapse, defects in the rectovaginal fibromuscularis, a nd/or a widened 
genital hiatus. This type of repair may improve obstructed defecatory dysfunction and 
bulge symptoms, but can be associated with postoperative pelvic pain and dys pareunia.3 
Paraiso et al evaluated three surgical techniques for posterior colporrhaphy (site-specific, 
midline plication, and porcine graft) and found no difference in over all symptom 
improvement, quality of life, and post-operative sexual function.4 Regardless of the 
technique used , a posterior colporrhaphy can cause considerable postoperative pain and 
can contribute to de novo dyspareunia in 9-20% of women.2, 4-[ADDRESS_624018] suture material for posterior colporrhaphy. Luck et al  found that 
suture erosion and wound dehiscence were noted after using a permanent sutur e during 
posterior colporrhaphy; consequently , permanent suture is now seldomly used.[ADDRESS_624019] of barbed suture on postoperative pain or surgical t ime after

Human Subject Research and Informed Consent 
 
Each subject will be required to sign an Institutional Review Boar d (IRB) approved consent form 
prior to beginning any study-related interventions or assessments. The informed consent form 
will describe the study in detail. Additionally, the study consent for m will disclose the planned 
uses of study data, as well as potential risks to the subjects. Each prospective subject will have 
the objectives of the study explained to them prior to enrollment. The s ubject will be given an 
opportunity to ask questions and decide whether or not to participate. Copi [INVESTIGATOR_485669], and the origina ls will be stored with the 
research records for this study at the Mercy study center.  
 
Subjects have the right to: 
• Voluntarily participate in the study 
• Withdraw or refuse participation in the study at any point without quest ioning 
• Understand the objectives of the study 
• Understand the risks and benefits of the study 
• Have their confidentiality maintained 
Participant (Subject)  Screening and Point of Enrollment 
Subjects scheduled to undergo posterior colporrhaphy with or without perineorrhaphy w ill be 
identified and screened against inclusion and exclusion criteria. If potential subjects meet the 
requirements for the study, they will be eligible to be invited to  participate .  Subjects will be 
consented for study enrollment by [CONTACT_13922], fellow physicians, nurse prac titioners, physician’s 
assistants, and/or a research nurse prior to surgery at either t heir pre-operative visit or the 
morning of surgery. Subjects will be randomized to one of the two trea tment groups in the 
operating room prior to starting the surgical procedure. 
Provider and Clinical Staff Training  
To ensure consistent posterior colporrhaphy technique, the principal inves tigator will provide in-
service educational video to all participating providers who will be performing surgery . 
Educational review will include review of suture materials  being used and specific repair 
protocol.  All clinical staff, including nursing and physicians, will  receive in-service training 
about the study protocol and guidelines. Providers performing follow-up exams  will be educated 
on pelvic organ prolapse quantification (POP- Q) examination technique, and a standardized 
method to digital ly palpat e suture burden and myofascial trigger points using a standardized 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_485670]. Personnel administering or collecting interviews/me asurement 
scales/questionnaires will be trained on how each interview/measur ement scale/questionnaire 
should be completed.

choose to withdraw from the study. 
Preoperative Period 
All eligible patients planned to undergo posterior colporrhaphy will be identifie d preoperatively, 
screened, and approached for participation in the study.  Concomitant pelvi c reconstructive 
surgical procedures allowed.  Subjects who do not meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria will 
be considered screen failures. Screen failures will be captured , and the cause for screen failure 
will be documented.   
If a patient agrees to participate in study, baseline demographic informat ion, as well as medical 
and medication history will be collected. A set of preoperative ba seline questionnaires will also 
be administered, including the PFDI -20, PSQI-12, and a baseline pain assessment using VAS. If 
a prior POP-Q exam is not documented in the chart, a POP-Q and myofascial trigger point exam 
will be completed at this visit. 
Consent will either be obtained at the preoperative visit . Or, if they are undergoing a virtual 
preoperative visit, they will receive an email with consent to re view and then sign consent on the 
day of surgery. 
Protocol Version Number: 5 
04/18/[ADDRESS_624023] of care anesthetic and 
prophylactic medications as determined by [CONTACT_16826].   
Intervention: Eligible subjects will be randomized using a computer-generated randomiz ation 
scheme, with patients assigned in a blinded 1:1 ratio, stratified by [CONTACT_485682], to either: 
Group 1:  Intervention 
1. Barbed suture : 2-0 dioxanone, glycolide and trimethylene carbonate (V-Loc 
90TMMedtronic) , delayed absorbable, monofilament, barbed-suture 
(1) Violet dyed 
(2) Tapered needle 
Group 2:  Control 
2. Non-barbed suture : 2-0 polydioxanone ( PDS® EthiconTM) delayed absorbable, 
monofilament , non-barbed suture 
(1) Violet dyed 
(2) Tapered needle 
The allocation sequence will be in sealed, opaque envelopes. An envelope w ill be retrieved in the 
operating room.  The OR circulating nurse will assemble the appropri ate intervention suture 
materials .  The envelope will then be labeled and given back to the research nurse. 
Procedures will be performed by [ADDRESS_624024], the posterior compartment vaginal 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_485672] (0.25% 
Marcaine with 1:200000 epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]) for tissue dissection and hemostasis prior to incision.  This 
local anesthetic may be diluted with normal saline to a final volume  deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_37040]. The vaginal epi[INVESTIGATOR_485673] i s indicated to correct the 
rectocele.  The vaginal epi[INVESTIGATOR_485674] .  Prior to starting 
the posterior colporrhaphy plication , a sequentially numbered opaque sealed envelope will be 
opened by [CONTACT_155323], revealing the study group allocation . Suture s will then be placed

 9 Control:  Subjects randomized to the non-barbed suture (Group 2) will have rectova ginal 
fibromuscularis plicated in an interrupted fashion as described above. The polydioxanone 
suture was chosen as a control due it being both an institutional and nat ional standard for 
suture and technique being used in the posterior compartment. Polydioxanone w as chosen 
over polyglactin, due to its similarity to the barbed suture mate rial and expert opi[INVESTIGATOR_485675] (Culligan 2005). Additionally, prior study protocols have used 
polydioxanone. 11,17-18 This also allows us to control for specific suture properties , 
including: delayed absorbable nature (180-210 days for polydioxanone vs. 90-110 days 
for barbed suture) , suture size, suture color (violet), synthetic monofilament, and tape red 
needle type (Appendix 4, Figure 1). 
 
Immediate Postoperative Period 
All surgery patients at our institution routinely receive enhanced recove ry after surgery (ERAS) 
protocol for pain management by a department standardized order set pr e and postoperatively , 
unless there is a contraindication. 
 
Most patients at our institution are discharged the same day of surge ry. Discharge criteria include 
independent ambulation, tolerate an oral diet, adequate pain control wi th oral medications, and 
voiding trial. If a vaginal pack is placed, it is removed prior to discharge. There will be no 
changes in discharge criteria for this study. 
 
The standard ERAS calls for a multimodal pain regimen postoperative ly.  Patients are discharged 
home on the following regimen: ibuprofen 600-800 mg every 8 hours, oxycodone/ 
acetamin ophen (Percocet) 5mg/325 mg or or hydrocodone/acetaminophen (Norco/Lortab) 
5mg/325mg [ADDRESS_624025] postoperative instructions, whi ch include general precautions, 
nothing per vagina for 6-8weeks, no lifting greater than 10 pounds until 6-8weeks.

 13 Secondary Outcome Measures 
 
Suture burden  and myofascial pain : This will be determined by [CONTACT_485686]/or visualization of knots/suture, a s well as 
palpation of myofascial trigger points performed at 6-weeks and 12-months . Recorded 
using a diagram in the medical record at follow-up visits (Appendix 4, Figure 2). 
 
Surgical time for posterior repair  (posterior colporrhaphy with or without 
perineorrhaphy ): We  will record total time of procedure start to finish in minut es, as w ell 
as total time of posterior repair from start to finish in mi nutes. 
 
Length of surgical repair  (posterior colporrhaphy): We will measure the total length of 
the posterior colporrhaphy in centi meters ( cm) (this will be measured from the hymen 
(most distal point ) to the level of the first suture pass (most proximal) ) at completion of 
the repair. 
 
Postoperative sexual function  measures:  We will record patient responses to the 
validated PI[INVESTIGATOR_45220] -[ADDRESS_624032] at follow-up visits (Appendix 2 , Figure 2). 
 
Postoperative patient quality of life (QOL) measures:  We will record patient 
responses to the validated PFDI -20 subscales (CRADI -8, POPDI-6) at preoperative visit, 
6-weeks, 6-months, and 12-months in the medical record at follow-up visits (Appendix 2, 
Figure 1) 
 
Suture and Operative Costs: We will record cost of suture for the posterior repair by 
[CONTACT_485687]. We wi ll also calculate 
how much a procedure costs based on posterior repair operative time (c ost/minute).  
 
Anatomical and subjective surgical failure in posterior com partment:  We will 
evaluate Stage of posterior prolapse on POP-Q examination, as we ll as with POPDI -[ADDRESS_624033] definition of anatom ical cure will be 
defined as Ba or Bp at </= 0 on POP-Q examination (i.e.at or beyond hymenal ring) 
and/or patient subjective symptom response on PFDI-20 questionnaire , with a negative 
response to questions: “Do you usually have a sensation of bulging or protrusi on from the 
vaginal area?” and “Do you usually have a bulge or something falling out that  you can 
see or feel in the vaginal area?” 21 
 
Adverse events:  Any adverse event related to posterior repair or suture type will be 
reported. We will use the Modified Clavien-Dindo Classification S ystem for surgical 
complications (Figure 3 ). We will a lso collect information from the EMR on if patients 
are re -admitted during the study time period (yes or no).  Please refer  to section on 
Adverse Events for details of reportable criteria.

• Investigator protocol and amendments 
• IRB submissions, modifications, and renewals 
• Data safety monitoring committee reports 
• IRB approved consent form 
• Data collection forms 
• Patient assessment forms 
• Patient questionnaires  
Data Safety Monitoring 
The research team will complete an initial report once 10% of t he enrolled subjects have 
completed the 6 weeks outcome data collection; thereafter, a repor t will be completed every 6 
months from the receipt of the DSMB’s recommendations. This report  will detail the progress 
and subject status, any adverse events, and any protocol deviation. The r esearch coordinator will 
inform all study staff members of any unanticipated problems involving ri sks to study subjects or 
others.  The research coordinator will facilitate and participa te in internal monitoring visits by 
[CONTACT_485688].  This will include a 
thorough review of research subjects records, source documents, regulat ory binders, and consent 
forms.  
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_485676]. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_485677]’s decision to 
allow the trial to continue, in accordance with the IRB’s standar d operating procedures and 
policies.  A protocol revision may be necessary for reasons including but  not limited to rights, 
safety of subjects, welfare of subjects, and thus, an amendment will be required. Appropriate 
approvals (i.e., IRB) of the revised protocol must be obtained prior t o implementation at each 
site.  
Protocol Version Number: 5 
04/18/[ADDRESS_624034] ten patients are enrolled and randomi zed, the study statisticians will 
generate a report for the data safety monitors to review.  Content and frequency of the reports 
will be agreed upon prior to implementation of the trial.  The P I will be responsible for ensuring 
that the study complies with the data safety monitors’ requests.   
 
Study Medical Device Information 
Medical Risks related to delayed absorbable monofilament sut ure include but are not limited 
to the following: injury to surrounding structures, allergic reacti on to suture material, surgical 
dehiscence of wound, wound infection, sutures remaining in place for extende d periods 
(>6weeks) which may be associated with localized irritation, loca lized erythema or induration if 
suture placed superficially, failure to provide adequate wound support in  closure of sites where 
expansion, stretching, or distension occurs, suture extrusion and delaye d absorption in tissue 
with poor blood supply, poor cosmetic result, and/or broken needles may resul t in extended or 
additional surgeries or residual foreign bodies. Additionally, inadverte nt needle sticks, may 
expose patient to bloodborne pathogens.  
Protocol Deviations 
Protocol deviations will be documented and logged on the Protocol Deviations l og (electronic 
version). This will be done for every protocol related deviation relat ed to any portion of the study 
timeline. Deviations will be reviewed and evaluated on an ongoing basis , and, as necessary, 
appropriate corrective and preventive actions (including notification, re -training, or 
discontinuation) will be put in place. 
Data Safety Monitoring 
Data safety monitors will include an external physician and research nur se. They will be tasked 
to review all adverse events that occur. A semi-annual report of a ll adverse events will be 
generated and sent to the data safety monitors every 6 months. 
Protocol Version Number: 5 
04/18/2022 
 17 All Seri ous Adverse Events (SAEs) will be reported to the data safety monit ors via email within 
2 business days of site staff being informed of its occurrence. The  PI [INVESTIGATOR_485678]. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_99606]-identified source 
documentation regarding the SAE will be included, as well as other c linically meaningful 
documentation. 
The PI ([CONTACT_485690]) will be responsible for ensuring that  the study complies with the 
data safety monitors’ requests. 
Repo rting Adverse Events 
  
Adverse events (AE) will be recorded and reported per the criteri a and timeline below.  
 
All AEs must be recorded and entered into the AE log and REDCap. An event number will be 
assigned by [CONTACT_155335].  The DSMB will be tasked to revi ew all adverse events that 
occur. A semi-annual report of all adverse events will be generat ed and sent to the DSMB every 
6-months. 
 
All Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) will be reported to the DSMB via email within [ADDRESS_624035] that suffers an allergic reaction to the study suture m aterial will be unblinded. This 
will be a reported adverse event that will also be reported to the DSMB, as outlined above.  
 
Adverse Event Definitions 
 
Adverse Event: any untoward medical occurrence, unintended disease or inj ury, or any untoward 
clinical signs (including abnormal laboratory finding) in subjects, whethe r or not related to study 
medications 
 
Serious Adverse Event: an adverse event that led to: 
• Death  
• Serious deterioration in the health of the subject that either re sulted in 
o A life -threatening illness or injury 
o A permanent impairment of a body structure or a body function 
o Medical or surgical intervention to prevent life-threatening illnes s or injury or 
permanent impairment to a body structure or body function 
 
Protocol Version Number: 5 
04/18/2022 
 18 Unrelated: No evidence that the timing of the AE has a relations hip to the time study medications 
were taken 
 
Possibly Related: The AE has a timely relationship to the study m edications, however a potential 
alternative etiology may be responsible for the AE 
 
Probably Related: The AE has a timely relationship to the study medic ations and the causative 
relationship can clearly be established. No potential alternative etiology is apparent. 
 
Severity Definitions 
 
Mild : Awareness of signs or symptoms, but easily tolerated and are of  minor irritant type causing 
no loss of time from normal activities. Symptoms do not require ther apy or a medical evaluation; 
signs and symptoms are transient.  
 
Moderate: Events introduce a low level of inconvenience or concern to t he subject and may 
interfere with daily activities but are usually improved by [CONTACT_485689]; moderate 
experiences may cause some interference with functioning.  
 
Severe: Events interrupt the subjects’ normal daily activities a nd generally require systemic drug 
therapy or other treatment; they are usually incapacitating. 
 
Surgical complications 
Surgical complications will be classified according to the Modifie d Clavien-Dindo Scale (I- V) 
(Figure 3 ).

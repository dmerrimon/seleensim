SECTION  I:  RESEARCH PLAN
1.Statement of Purpose: State  the scientific aim(s) of the study, or the hypotheses to be tested. 
To explore in a pi[INVESTIGATOR_83021], the impact of Home Blood Pressure Monitoring with patient directed 
information as compared to usual care on the postoperative management of blood pressure.  
The intervention and control groups will be defined by, 1) preoperative home blood pressure monitoring with a 
detailed report sent to the patient, and 2) usual standard of care including a suggestion during the pre-operative 
clinic appointment to follow up with Primary Care. Both groups will receive a brief questionnaire about their blood 
pressure treatment and medication adherence.  We will examine the rate of primary care follow-up and changes in 
hypertension treatment at [ADDRESS_979252]-operative, through a telephone call.  This information, along with

Page [ADDRESS_979253]: State the expected duration of the project, including all follow-up and data analysis 
activities.  
Data collection will  take approximately [ADDRESS_979254]-surgical date follow up for all subjects. We 
estimate a 5-year time frame total, allowing for data collection and interpretation and publication after peer-reviews.
3.Background:  Describe the background information that led to the plan for this project. Provide references to support 
the expectation of obtaining useful scientific data.
Elevated blood pressure remains an important, and modifiable, cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factor. Per the 
American Heart Association 2017 Hypertension Guidelines, “it was the leading cause of death and disability-
adjusted life years worldwide” and, in the [LOCATION_002], it occupi[INVESTIGATOR_717874], and second place, after smoking, as a preventable cause of death for any reason.[ADDRESS_979255] for the comparison of treatment effects but are resource intensive.  Pi[INVESTIGATOR_717875].2 We propose the following research plan.
4.Research  Plan: Summarize the study design and research procedures using non-technical language that can be readily 
understood by [CONTACT_20894]. Be sure to distinguish between standard of care vs. research procedures 
when applicable and include any flowcharts of visits specifying their individual times and lengths. Describe the setting 
in which the research will take place.
In the  proposed pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], we will recruit 100 preoperative patients in the preadmission testing center with blood 
pressure elevation for home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM) and questionnaires regarding life style and blood 
pressure treatment and adherence vs. usual care. Approximately 40% of our pre-operative population presents with a 
pre-surgical blood pressure > 140/[ADDRESS_979256]-surgery. To assess patient satisfaction with the interventions and 
medication adherence, a short questionnaire will be administered.
Setting and population: We propose a pi[INVESTIGATOR_717876], a Level [ADDRESS_979257] to enroll 30 subjects each month and thus meet our recruitment goals within 3 months.
Screening and Enrollment: Inclusion and screening: We propose to recruit patients who present for ambulatory 
surgery, aged >18 years, with a preoperative blood pressure > 140/[ADDRESS_979258] be able to speak on the phone and be able to provide their 
own consent. There will not be surrogate consent or surrogate participation in follow up phone visits. Patients who 
are unable or unwilling to be contact[CONTACT_5143], are non-English speaking, or are unable to operate an 
automated home blood pressure monitor will also be excluded.

Page 3 of 23Randomization: Individuals who meet the inclusion criteria and have provided consent to participate in the study 
will be randomized to one of two groups in a 1:1 ratio using permuted blocks of 4 and stratified by [CONTACT_547]. 
Interventions: While at the Preadmission Testing Center for their standard of care visit, all enrollees will complete 
a short questionnaire battery (please see Appendix I below for proposed survey) and be randomized to one of the 
two groups:
1)HBPM and Counseling group:  Enrolled patients will be fitted with a HBPM device (Omron MX3 model BP742, 
Omron, Shaumberg, IL) and instructed in its use.  The accuracy of this monitor has been validated previously.[ADDRESS_979259] readings.  These will be compared to two successive readings taken by [CONTACT_717886] a manual 
sphygmomanometer.  If the average SBP or DBP readings differ by [CONTACT_726] 10 mmHg, a new cuff/HBPM 
combination will be assessed.  After validation, patients will be given the device to take home with instructions 
to record a series of two successive morning blood pressures and 2 successive evening blood pressures each 
day until their surgery date.  Patients will be asked to return the HBPM device on the morning of surgery.  At 
the same time they receive the HBPM device, they will also be provided with the National Institutes of Health 
(NIH) booklet called “Your guide on lowering blood pressure”, which has several guidelines regarding diet, 
exercise and lifestyle changes that can be implemented to improve blood pressure control.  After presentation 
for surgery and HBPM data processing, these patients will receive a summary report of the findings from their 
questionnaire and HBPM device feedback identifying whether they are likely to be able to control their 
hypertension (please see Appendix II below for proposed letters).  If so, they will be instructed to follow-up in 
primary care within 30 days. 
2) Usual Care Group: The usual care group will receive brief counseling after the PAT visit which will review their 
blood pressure readings taken at the clinic and how they compare with the American Heart Association (AHA) 
blood pressure guidelines. They will be offered the suggestion that they should follow up with their primary 
care doctor 2-[ADDRESS_979260] convenience.
Assessments: All subjects will be contact[CONTACT_162776] 60 days postoperatively to ascertain (please see 
Appendix III below for proposed survey): 
1. Subject’s attendance at a primary care appointment within 60 days postoperatively.
2. New/adjusted treatment for hypertension within 60 days postoperatively.
3.Patient acceptance/satisfaction with blood pressure care.
5. Genetic  Testing   N/A ☒
6.Subject  Population: Provide a detailed description of the types of human subjects who will be recruited into this study.
Patients will be recruited from the Pre-Admission Testing Clinic, both male and female, >18 years of age, English 
speaking and with a mean preoperative blood pressure > 140 and/or [ADDRESS_979261] classification:  Check off all classifications of subjects that will be specifically recruited for enrollment in the 
research project.  Will  subjects who may require additional safeguards or other considerations be enrolled in the study? 
If so, identify the population of subjects requiring special safeguards and provide a justification for their involvement.

8.Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria : What are the criteria used to determine subject inclusion or exclusion?
Inclusion and screening: We propose to recruit patients who present for ambulatory surgery, both male and female, 
>18 years of age, and with a preoperative blood pressure > 140 and/or 90 mmHg taken as the mean of two readings. 
Exclusion criteria: Non-English speaking patients,  minors,  patients unable to consent for themselves or refuse 
participation in the study, inability or unwillingness to be contact[CONTACT_5143], or an inability to operate an 
automated home blood pressure monitor. 
9. How  will eligibility be determined, and by [CONTACT_20898]? 
[CONTACT_409662]  or designated research personnel, will be present in the preoperative clinic and will select patients who meet 
inclusion criteria and do not meet exclusion criteria. If the patient is alert, oriented and able to give self-consent, they 
will be asked to provide consent for participation. No surrogate consent will be accepted.
10.Risks:  Describe the reasonably foreseeable risks, including risks to subject privacy, discomforts, or inconveniences 
associated with subjects participating in the research. 
Bruising or  discomfort from blood pressure cuff if fitted incorrectly or long measurement times due to elevated blood 
pressure values; possible subject anxiety or inconvenience over having to measure blood pressure twice daily.
There may  be a risk to privacy related to participation in research.   
11.Minimizing  Risks: Describe the manner in which the above-mentioned risks will be minimized.
a. Patients  will be advised to rest and relax before the reading, and avoid activities known to influence BP such as 
caffeine, exercise, eating, talking or cold exposure 30 minutes before the measurement. 
b. We  will ensure properly selected blood pressure cuffs based on patient physical characteristics, with a bladder 
length 80 percent of the patient’s arm circumference, an ideal width of 40 percent, and a size selection as follows:
22  to 26 cm 12 × 22 cm (small adult).
27  to 34 cm 16 × 30 cm (adult).
35  to 44 cm 16 × 36 cm (large adult).
c. To  reduce anxiety caused by [CONTACT_717887], we will reassure that these results will not affect their access 
to medical care or postpone their surgical treatment. We will also give more information about how accurate their 
elevated blood pressure in preadmission testing clinic really was and how this may be influenced by [CONTACT_717888]. We will also counsel patients on lifestyle modifications and follow up with their primary care 
physician.
d. Regarding  PHI, it will be stored for the shortest possible period of time and destroyed upon completion of data 
analysis. The minimal amount of PHI will be collected to conduct the study. Only de-identified information will 
remain on a server. For full discussion of storage and destruction of PHI, please see below.

12.Data  and Safety Monitoring Plan:  Include an appropriate Data and Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP) based on the 
investigator’s risk assessment stated below. (Note: the HIC will make the final determination of the risk to subjects.)
a. What  is the investigator’s assessment of the overall risk level for subjects participating in this study? 
Minimal
b. If  children are involved, what is the investigator’s assessment of the overall risk level for the children 
participating in this study? N/A
c. Include  an appropriate Data and Safety Monitoring Plan:
The principal  investigator [INVESTIGATOR_22419], assuring protocol compliance, and conducting the 
safety reviews at the specified frequency bi-weekly.  During the review process the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_34734], require modification/amendment, or close to enrollment.
The principal  investigator [INVESTIGATOR_158225] (IRB) have the authority  to stop or suspend the study or 
require modifications.
This protocol  presents minimal risks to the subjects and Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to Subjects or 
Others (UPI[INVESTIGATOR_20865]), including adverse events, are not anticipated. In the unlikely event that such events occur, 
Reportable Events (which are events that are serious or life-threatening and unanticipated (or anticipated but 
occurring with a greater frequency than expected) and possibly, probably, or definitely related) or Unanticipated 
Problems Involving Risks to Subjects or Others that may require a temporary or permanent interruption of study 
activities will be reported immediately (if possible), followed by a written report within 5 calendar days of the 
Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_20866] (using the appropriate forms from the website) and 
any appropriate funding and regulatory agencies. The investigator will apprise fellow investigators and study 
personnel of all UPI[INVESTIGATOR_717877]. The protocol’s IRB will be informed of any unexpected adverse events that carry implications for future 
subjects’ decision to participate within 5 days of the event becoming known to the principal investigator.

13.Statistical  Considerations: Describe the statistical analyses that support the study design. 
For the primary analysis, we will estimate the proportion of subjects with 90% confidence interval that had a primary 
care follow-up visit within 60 days and the proportion reporting new/adjusted hypertension treatment.  For the 
primary analysis, we will consider those lost to follow-up as not receiving a primary care visit or new/adjusted 
hypertension treatment.  We will also estimate the mean and standard deviation of the patient satisfaction score 
in each group. 
In secondary analyses, we will compare the proportion of patients in each group who received primary care follow-
up and the proportion reporting new/adjusted hypertension treatment using the Fisher’s Exact Test. The 
distribution in patient satisfaction scores will be compared among the two groups using a Kruskal–Wallis one-way 
analysis of variance by [CONTACT_717890].  In a further analysis, we will examine the proportion of patients demonstrating 
HBPM elevation.   Specific cut-offs for the interpretation of home blood pressure are controversial.4 For our own 
analysis, we will use the mean home blood pressure threshold > 135/85 mmHg as indicating hypertension, in-line 
with recommendations from the American Heart Association.2 A similar HBPM cutoff of 137/84 mmHg has 
previously been associated with a 10% increase in the adjusted relative hazard of mortality relative to ideal blood 
pressure.5

Page 6 of 23Sample Size:  As the purpose of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_717878], 100subjects will allow us to estimate for a continuous variable a 90% confidence interval around the 
mean of +/- 0.[ADDRESS_979263] 90% confidence interval widths of 0.21, 0.27, 0.30, and 0.32, respectively. These estimations 
will allow for a rigorous power analysis and sample-size estimation in future clinical trials.   
Interpretation:  The data from this pi[INVESTIGATOR_717879].  Regarding feasibility, if significant non-adherence to the study protocol occurs, we may have to 
reconsider the nature of the intervention – perhaps moving toward a primary care provider-centered intervention 
that might result in improved adherence.  In the event that adherence is high, implementing the proposed 
intervention in a larger cohort may gain acceptance from care providers and institutions more broadly. If the pi[INVESTIGATOR_717880]/satisfaction, the interventions will similarly be reexamined as above.

will review the full Compound Authorization and Consent document with the subject discussing the purpose and scope 
of the study, explaining any risks and/or potential benefits, procedures associated with participation, economic 
considerations, confidentiality of the subject’s information, and their ability to voluntarily participate and withdraw at 
any time during the study will be explained in person. It will be explained that participation is completely voluntary and 
that they may withdraw at any time without penalty. Full disclosure regarding their blood pressure measurement will 
be provided. Only after the patient has a thorough understanding of the study and what is being asked of them and 
after all their questions have been answered by [CONTACT_717892], will they be asked 
to indicate a decision to participate by [CONTACT_17317]. A copy of the signed consent form will be given to each 
subject.
7. Evaluation  of Subject(s) Capacity to Provide Informed Consent/Assent: Indicate how the personnel obtaining consent 
will assess the potential subject’s ability and capacity to consent to the research being proposed.

Page [ADDRESS_979267]-operative surveys (see attached appendix I and 
III). On the day of surgery, data from the HBPM group will be collected. Additionally, we will do a chart review post-
operatively to look for blood pressure ranges following surgery.
2. How  will the research data be collected, recorded and stored? 
Each patient  will be assigned a number at time of initial visit. All patient information will be stored in a locked-box in 
the PAT clinic and uploaded on an encrypted, password protected computer. Patient data in the server will contain the 
assigned number, but will NOT contain MRN, patient’s first name [CONTACT_717905].  All paper sheets will be 
destroyed after being uploaded. A separate file with the key containing patient’s first name, MRN, telephone number, 
day-of-surgery and assigned number will be used for day-of-surgery and telephone follow up’s. This sheet will be stored 
on a separate iron-key encrypted flash-drive and will be password protected. This flash drive will be maintained by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. 
Diaz. Once all follow-up data is collected and de-identified information is uploaded, this file will be deleted per IT policy. 
All information gathered from follow-up will be uploaded onto the server, in a de-identified manner.
3. How  will the digital data be stored? ☐CD  ☐DVD  ☒Flash Drive  ☐Portable Hard Drive   ☒Secured Server  ☒Laptop 
Computer  ☐Desktop Computer  ☐Other
4. What  methods and procedures will be used to safeguard the confidentiality and security of the identifiable study data 
and the storage media indicated above during and after the subject’s participation in the study?
The use  of locked boxes for paper information, de-identified information on a server for long-term data after final 
communication with the patient, use of minimal patient identifiers and software encryption (for sheets containing 
information for follow up and chart review) all help protect patient security.
All portable  devices must contain encryption software, per University Policy 5100.  If there is a technical reason a device 
cannot be encrypted please submit an exception request to the Information Security, Policy and Compliance Office by 
[CONTACT_20912]://its.yale.edu/egrc or email [EMAIL_364]
5. What  will be done with the data when the research is completed? Are there plans to destroy the identifiable data? If 
yes, describe how, by [CONTACT_22467]. If no, describe how the data and/or identifiers will 
be secured. 
Paper information  in the locked box will be destroyed (shredded) once uploaded to the server. It will be destroyed by 
[CONTACT_717894]. The files containing patient name, MRN and telephone number will be 
destroyed (deleted digitally per IT policy) once the follow-up is complete by [CONTACT_717895]-up 
interviews.

Healthy patient
Dear Mr./Ms.  [patient name]
Congratulations! The following  are your average home blood pressure measurements [BP mmHg], which are considered 
normal. We  encourage you to continue with a healthy lifestyle to maintain these numbers, and to share these with your 
doctor.  
As people  age, their systolic blood pressures tend to rise so it is important to continue to monitor your blood pressures with 
your primary care  physician from time to time in the future.
We wish  you well, and a speedy recovery from your surgery.
Non-adherence (no  HBPM letter)
Dear Mr./Ms.  [patient name]
Based on  your answers to our questionnaire, you are currently diagnosed with elevated blood pressure and receiving 
treatment. However,  we noticed that when you were seen in our clinic, you had a blood pressure value that is considered 
elevated. We  do not know whether your blood pressure is frequently elevated, but many patients with elevated blood 
pressure in our  clinic have been shown to also have elevated blood pressures at home. Many patients sometimes find that 
it is difficult to  take medications as prescribed, and when high blood pressure is untreated for a long period of time, it can 
increase your risk  of bad health outcomes such as strokes, heart attacks, eye, and kidney problems.  
We encourage  you to follow up with your doctor to discuss your blood pressure medications and ways of helpi[INVESTIGATOR_717883]. We also encourage you to look at the enclosed brochure by [CONTACT_594464]  (NIH), which talks about ways you can help decrease your blood pressure through a healthy lifestyle. You can also

Non-adherence (HBPM  letter)
Dear Mr./Ms.  [patient name]
The following  are your average home blood pressure measurements [BP mmHg], which are considered elevated. Based on 
your previous  answers to our questionnaire, you are currently treated for high blood pressure, but your blood pressures 
remain elevated.   One common reason for this is that sometimes it is difficult to take your medications as prescribed. When 
high blood  pressure is untreated for a long period of time, it can increase your risk of bad health outcomes such as strokes, 
heart attacks,  eye, and kidney problems.

Non-diagnosis (no  HBPM letter)
Dear Mr./Ms.  [patient name]
Based on  your answers to our questionnaire, you have never been diagnosed with high blood pressure. However, we 
noticed that when  you were seen in our clinic, you had a blood pressure value that is considered elevated. We do not know 
whether your  blood pressure is frequently elevated, but many patients with elevated blood pressure in our clinic have been

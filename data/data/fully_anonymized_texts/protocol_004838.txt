Antibacterial Envelope Noninferiority Study  December 6 , 2019 
 3 1.0 Background       
 
The number of cardiac implantable electronic devices ( CIEDs ) implanted each 
year has grown rapi[INVESTIGATOR_77351], largely due to expanding use of implantable cardioverter -defibrillators (ICDs) and devices capable of delivering cardiac 
resynchronization therapy (CRT).
[ADDRESS_84386] increasingly been utilized in older 
patients with multiple medical comorbidities. As a result  CIED infections , defined as 
infections involving the generator implant site (pocket) and/or intravascular leads , have 
become increas ingly prevalent , with the rate of growth in infections outpacing that of 
CIED procedures.9 The increase in 
incidence of CIED infections has outpaced the growth in device implantation, in large part due to the medical complexity of today’s CIED patients.
9-[ADDRESS_84387] two risk factors, the reported incidence of CIED infection is 2- 3%.
1,14,[ADDRESS_84388] suggested an important role of the minocycline and rifampin impregnated TYRX antibacterial envelope in reducing infections.  The device consists  of 2 
polypropylene mesh sheets joined on 3 sides with a 3mm seam and is available in 2 sizes to accommodate pacemaker and ICD pulse CIED infection risk factor  References

 4 generators. This polypropylene envelope releases minocycline and rifampin from a 
bioresorbable polyarylate polymer over approximately 7 days, directly into the CIED 
generator pocket  (Figure  1). 
  
Aside from optimal skin preparation and perioperative intravenous antibiotics, 
other practices to reduce the risk of CIED infections vary widely. Many operators use an antibact erial s olution (e.g., polymyxin- B/bacitracin) to irrigate  the pocket during device 
implantation. Additionally, many centers  have adopted the routine use of prophylactic 
postoperative antibiotics to reduce the risk of CIED infections. However, neither of these strategies has  been evaluated in randomized clinical studies. Antibacterial irrigation 
solution  is expensive, and oral antibiotics are associated with a small yet clinically 
important risk of adverse effects, including Clostridium difficile  infection. Therefore, 
prospective randomized studies are needed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and cost -
effectiveness of intraoperative antibacterial rinse and postoperative oral antibiotics.  
  
Summary of significance:  CIED infections constitute major complications of 
device implantations or revisions and are becoming increasingly prevalent. Infections 
are associated with increased morbidity, mortality, and cost, and are very difficult to treat. Recent studies have explored ways to reduce the incidence of CIED infections , 
and use of the TYRX antibacterial envelope has emerged as a potential  strategy for 
prevention.  Other strategies including intraoperative antibacterial irrigation  and 
postoperative oral antibiotics are commonly used despi[INVESTIGATOR_77352], safety, and cost -effectiveness. We and others have reported a 
very low incidence (<1%) of CIED infections in high- risk patients receiving the TYRX 
antibacterial envelope. One intriguing possibility is that the antibacterial envelope can be used instead of intraoperative antibacterial rinse and postoperative oral antibiotics. Therefore, an important knowledge gap exists about the best practices  to prevent 
CIED infections in high -risk individuals.  
  2.0 Rationale and Specific Aims  
 
SPECIFIC AIM: to test the hypothesis that the use of the TYRX antibacterial envelope alone  is noninferior to a strategy using the antibacterial envelope and 
intraoperative antibacterial irrigant and postoperative oral antibiotics for the 
reduction of cardiac implantable device infections in patients with ≥2 risk factors for infection.  
 
CIED infections are devastating yet potentially preventable complications. We 
previously conducted a retrospective study of the TYRX antibacterial envelope and found that use of the device in patients with ≥2 risk factors for CIED infection was associated with a m arkedly decreased infection rate (0.4% with the device versus 3% 
without, adjusted odds ratio [95% confidence interval ]: 0.09 [0.01 to 0.73], P = 0.02). All 
patients in our previous study had intraoperative irrigation of the device pocket with polymyxin- B/bacitracin  solution and received routine postoperative oral antibiotics 
consistent with local practices. However, whether use of intraoperative irrigant and 
Antibacterial Envelope Noninferiority Study  December [ADDRESS_84389] of polymyxin- B/bacitracin solution and concerns over 
unnecessary use of oral antibiotics and emerging resistant microorganisms, it is critically important to establish whether these treatments offer any incremental benefit for patients at high risk for a CIED infection who are receiving the TYRX antibacterial envelope. The Specific Aim  of this study will be to prospectively test the hypothesis 
that an infection risk -reduction strategy using the TYRX antibacterial envelope 
alone is n oninferior to a strategy using the envelope with intraoperative 
antibacterial irrigant and postoperative oral antibiotics in patients undergoing a CIED procedure who have at least [ADDRESS_84390] 
Staphylococcus epi[INVESTIGATOR_77353], Staphylococcus capi[INVESTIGATOR_17727], Escherichia coli, and Acinetobacter baumannii.
19 Importantly, systemic levels of minocycline and rifampin 
were undetectable.  
 Use of the TYRX antibacterial envelope has been associated with a reduced 
incidence of CIED infections in retrospective studies of high- risk patients.  In a 
multi- center  trial, use of the TYRX antibacterial envelope was associated with a low risk 
of CIED infections (0.5%).
20 However, the relatively short follow -up period (mean: 1.9 
months) and lack of a control arm limited the interpretation of the study’s results. We 
conducted a retrospective controlled study of the TYRX antibacterial envelope in 
patients with at least 2 CIED infection risk factors at our institution. Among 260 TYRX envelope recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], the incidence of CIED infection after a mean 18.7 month follow -up 
period was 0.4%, compared with 3% in 639 high- risk controls who did not receive the 
envelope (adjusted odds ratio: 0.09, 95% confidence interval 0.01 to 0.73, P  =0.02).
15 
Another retrospective study at a high- volume center found that the prevalence of CIED 
infections decreased from 1.5% to 0.6% after the TYRX antibacterial envelope was 
instituted into practice (P =0.03) .21 
  
Based on these and other studies, the Worldwide Randomized Antibiotic 
Envelope CIED Infection Prevention Trial (WRAP -IT) was conceived.  This landmark trial 
prospectively evaluate d the efficacy of the TYRX -A antibacterial envelope. However, 
our study is complementary to the WRAP -IT trial  because we will specifically eva luate 
whether the TYRX -A antibacterial envelope alone offers ample protection against CIED 
infections without the use of intraoperative antibacterial solution and postoperative oral antibiotics.

Patients will be followed for CIED infections for a minimum of [ADDRESS_84392] whether the antibacterial envelope alone is noninferior to a strategy using the envelope and antibacterial irrigant and oral antibiotics.  
 Recruitment and retention: Patients will be enrolled at 4 high-volume centers: 
Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee (the coordinating center), Thomas Jefferson University Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_77354], Pennsylvania, The Valley Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_77355], New Jersey, and Cooper Health System  in Camden, New 
Jersey. Additional sites may  be added as needed. Patients will be screened from 
cardiology clinic schedules, electrophysiology lab schedules,  and inpatient censuses. A 
research coordinator  at each site will be responsible for screening, enrollment, and data 
collection. The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_77356]. 
 Patients who are scheduled to undergo a de novo pacemaker or ICD implant, 
generator exchange, device, lead, or pocket revision, or re- implantation after a recent 
CIED infection  will be screened for entry into the study. After careful consideration of 
inclusion and exclusion criteria, prospective participants will receive written and verbal information about the study from study personnel. Willing participants will be provided a written informed consent form, and after all questions have been answered, will be asked to sign the form.  
 Patients scheduled for CIED implantation with a device not manufactured by 
[CONTACT_77359]. will be considered for our study. In addition, de novo Medtronic Inc. non-
CRT pacemaker and ICD implantations will be considered.  
 Patients with a current CIED pocket infection will be excluded since the TYRX 
antibacterial envelope is not indicated for the treatment of an active infection. However, 
patients with a recent infection, who have had successful CIED system explantation and are scheduled for  implantation of a new CIED system (usually on the contralateral side 
of the chest) will be considered for inclusion in our study.  
 Randomization:  Randomization will be performed at the coordinating center 
using a permuted block design with random block sizes of 2, 4, or 6 patients. Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_77360].  
  6.0 Study Procedures  
 
Device implantation and follow -up. CIED procedures  will be performed in 
accordance with  established practice guidelines. Perioperative procedures to re duce the 
risk of CIED infection  including  optimal  skin preparation and intravenous antibiotics 
Antibacterial Envelope Noninferiority Study  December 6 , 2019 
 8 (cefazolin or vancomycin) will be applied to all patients. All patients will receive the 
TYRX absorbable antibacterial envelope per routine care.  
 
Patients randomized to the intraoperative antibacterial irrigant /postoperative oral 
antibiotic ( control) arm will undergo irrigation of the device pocket with up to [ADDRESS_84393].  Patients in the control arm will 
also receive 3 days of postoperative oral antibiotics (cephalexin 500mg 3 times daily, 
clindamycin 300mg 3 times daily, or  levofloxacin 500mg once daily)  as per investigator 
routine ordering practice with discretion per each individual patient . Patients randomized 
to the  experimental arm will not receive intraoperative antibacterial irrigation (will be 
allowed up to 1 liter sterile saline irrigation), nor post -operative oral antibiotics.  
 All patients will be followed after their procedures according to es tablished 
practice guidelines. At a minimum, patients will be seen 2-4 weeks after the procedure 
for a wound check, at 6 months, and then every year or more frequently  as dictated by 
[CONTACT_6904]’s clinical s tatus . For patients who are referred to a study center for their 
CIED procedure and follow -up with a local electrophysiologist a study coordinator will 
call the patient at [ADDRESS_84394] a copy of the follow- up clinic visit note. We anticipate that this will apply to only a small minority 
(<10%) of study subjects. A digital photograph of the device pocket will be captured at the 2-4-week postoperative visit. In addition, the study nurse will telephone each patient 
3 months after implantation to assess for symptoms and signs of infection. For the 
purposes of the study, patients will continue to be followed for a minimum of 6 months after the procedure, but additional follow -up data after six months may be collected 
continuously until the study closes.  
 Ascertainment of the primary endpoint: CIED infection after a minimum 6-
month follow -up period.  The primary study endpoint will be CIED infection resulting in 
complete CIED system removal, antibiotic therapy in patients who are not candidates 
for system re moval, or death due to CIED infection. To avoid detection bias we will 
prospectively apply criteria for definition of the primary endpoint and ask treating physicians to thoroughly document objective findings  (Table 2). 
 Table 2: Examples of objective sign s of CIED infection.  
 
 
 Objective findings of CIED infection  
*Fever or leukocytosis without an alternative explanation (e.g., urinary  
  tract infection or pneumonia)  
*Tenderness, erythema, or warmth at the pulse generator site  
*Purulent discharge from the pulse generator site (from incision or fistula)  
*Positive blood or pulse generator site cultures  
*Vegetation adherent to CIED hardware  
*Purulent material within pulse generator pocket upon reoperation  
Antibacterial Envelope Noninferiority Study  December [ADDRESS_84395] guidelines . A panel of 3 physicians  
at the coordinating center who are blinded to study assignment (experimental versus control)  will independently adjudicate outcomes  in “real time” and will vote whether or 
not the criteria for CIED infection have been met . A minor superficial infection of the 
incision that does not involve the generator pocket, does not result in any systemic symptoms or signs, and is treated with either observation or  a short course of oral 
antibiotics, will not be counted as a CIED infection but will be considered a secondary 
endpoint . 
 Study oversight:  The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_77357]. To ensure fidelity with the study protocol, an independent study coordinator at Vanderbilt University who is not directly involved w ith the study will review upon initiation of the study and first patient 
enrolled at each site, and then a random selection (10%) of patient records at each site  
(including Vanderbilt University) on a continuous basis set out by [CONTACT_77361], and quarterly prepare a report for the study’s principal investigator.  
  
7.0 Risks  
 
Risks associated with the TYRX -A antibacterial envelope:  The TYRX -A 
antibacterial envelope has been used extensively at each study site  since 2009, and all 
implanting electrophysiologists are familiar with its use. The volume of the device generator pocket has to be expanded by [CONTACT_3450] 10- 20% to accommodate the 
envelope. This creates the potential for an  increased risk of bleeding and he matoma, 
although these have not been quantified. Other potential risks of envelope use include allergic reaction and pain or discomfort at the generator site. Importantly, systemic levels of rifampin and minocycline were undetectable in animals that receiv ed the 
antibacterial envelope in a previous study.
19 The previous generation, non- absorbable 
envelope was associated with increased scarring within the generator pocket that posed difficulty with explantation in a minority of cases. The absorbable envelope to be used in the current study was developed with this limitation in mind and should reduce scarring, although this requires further study. In summary, the antibacterial envelope has been implanted in thousands of patients to date and has been associated with a very low incidence of adverse events.  
 
Risks associated with polymyxin -B: Altho ugh parenteral use of polymyxin- B is 
associated with significant adverse effects, the risks associated with intraoperative irrigation are largely undefined but believed to be minimal.  
 
Antibacterial Envelope Noninferiority Study  December 6 , 2019 
 10 Risks associated with neomycin:   The most common adverse reactions to 
oral neomycin are nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.  However, the risks associated 
with intraoperative irrigation are thought  to be  minimal.  
 Risks associated with amikacin:   Approximately 1- 10% experience 
neurotoxicity, nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity.  Less than 1% experience hypotension, headache, rash, nausea, vomiting, tremors, arthralgia, weakness and allergic reacting.  However,  the risks associated with intraoperative irri gation 
are believed to be minimal.  
 
Risks associated with bacitracin:  The topi[INVESTIGATOR_77358]. Systemic use of bacitracin is associated with rash, albuminuria, nausea, vomiting, azotemia, nephrotoxicity, pain at injection site, renal failure, and anaphylaxis. The risks associated with intraoperative irrigation with bacitracin solution are largely undefined but 
thought to be minimal due to little, if any, systemic absorption.

  9.0 Study Withdrawal/Discontinuation 
 
Participation in the study is strictly voluntary, and patients will be able to withdraw 
at any time. Following the subject’s withdrawal, no further data will be collected, although any analyzed data will be maintained.   
  10.0 Statistical Considerations  We conducted a sample size/power calculation based on both frequentist and 
Bayesian methods. These calculations were performed by [CONTACT_18854]. Hui Bian and [CONTACT_77363] and overseen by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Chang Yu, Ph.D. in the Vanderbilt University Department of Biostatistics. Based on our previous clinical experience, we estimate the infection rate in the control group to be 1%. Using frequentist methods  and a noninferiority limit of 1%, 
we will need to recruit [ADDRESS_84397] 80% power to show  noninferiority at an 
alpha level of 0.05. We also conducted a simulation using a Bayesian flexible design 
analysis. We again assumed a 1% event rate among controls and a noninferiority limit of 1%. In the simulation the odds of being able to claim noninferiority were 0.[ADDRESS_84398] our

was extended by [CONTACT_33018] 
12 months to a 30-month Extension  
Period.  It was revised to accommodate 
patients completing the 18 -month 
Extension Period that would like 
to continue study treatment at the 
investigator’s discretion.  
Change to Extension Period from 
blinded to unblinded . Upon completion of primary 
endpoint analysis, the extension 
will be unblinded for patient 
transpare ncy and to allow 
investigators to up titrate dose 
level up to 0.7 mg/kg dose level 
as needed.   
Upon completion of the study , 
participants will be provided the 
opportunity to transition into a 
separate Sotatercept Long -Term 
Follow -Up Study.  Permits part icipants in the

necessary to calculate the total 
volume to be administered based on 
weight, rounding should be at 
[ADDRESS_461277].   Please ref er to the 
IRT manual  for details.”  This has been a common question 
Investigator Sites have asked 
Pharmaceutical Product 
Development ([COMPANY_003]) for additional 
clarification.  
Section  6.3, Dose 
Modification  Corrected guidance for dose 
modif ications and dose delay 
(Figure  2 and Figure  3). To clarify that participants are to 
RESTART/CONTIN UE on the 
same dose level administered 
prior to the dose delay.  
Amended text: “Upon approval of 
Protocol Amendment 0 7D and 
unblinding of study sites and 
participants, study treatment dose 
may be escalated up to 0.7 mg/kg.  
If dose reductions are conducte d due 
to an AE not related to study 
treatment, the dose can be escalated 
when the AE resolves.  In cases of 
dose reducti on due to an increase in 
Hgb or decre ase in platelets, the 
dose can be escalated after 2 
consecutive cycles in which Hgb or 
platelet val ues are stable.”  To clarify the dose modification 
guidelines .

revised to guidance.  
Hgb and thrombocytop enia guidance 
was revised due to the [ADDRESS_461278] .  Moved 
management of leukocytopenia, 
neutropenia , and AESI per DMC 
decisions.   Safety monitoring due to ongoing  
patient review and an extended 
1-year duration in study treatment .  
AESIs, neutropenia , and 
leuko cytopenia will continue to be 
monitored.  Safety monitoring 
guidance on these items can be 
found in Section  8.4 which cov ers 
the monitoring of identified, 
potential, and AESIs.  
Section  6.5., 
Randomization and 
Blinding  Added unblinding process:

study 
treatment while adding, re
moving, 
or adjusting t
he dose of SOC 
concomitant medications (
for any 
chronic conditions or P

parameters and  guidelines after 
reviewing active and past AESIs 
experienced by [CONTACT_368572] -
administered PAH patients . Ongoing monitoring an
d 
evaluation of active and p
ast 
sotat ercept patient’s AESIs are 
necessary to assess the overall 
safety of the PAH patient 
population ; therefore, a detail 
section for safety monitori

Overall Design  
This is a Phase 2, double -blind , randomized, placebo -controlled, parallel -group  study of 
sotatercept  plus SOC versus placebo  plus SOC in participants  with PAH of WH O functional 
class (FC) II-III.  Participants will remain on SOC therapi[INVESTIGATOR_368550].  
In the Placebo -Controlled Treatment Period, participants will be randomly assigned in a 3:3:4  
ratio to receive subcutaneous (SC) injections of place bo, sotatercept 0.3  mg/kg , or sotatercept 
0.7 mg/kg , respectively , every [ADDRESS_461286] had a Cycle  9 Day 1A (C9D1A ) 
pulmonary vascular resistance  (PVR ) assessment will continue into  the 30-month Extension 
Period .  After the primary endpoint analysis is completed, the trial will be unblinded and 
extended for a n additional 12  months.  Investigators will be provided with the treatment 
assignments of their respective patients.   In the Extension Period, participants who received 
sotatercept  in the Placebo -Controlled Treatment Period will continue to receive their current  dose 
of sotatercep t SC every 21 days plus SOC .  Participants who received  placebo  will be 
re-randomized 1:1 to receive  either sotatercept 0.3  mg/kg SC or sotatercept 0.7 mg/kg SC every 
21 days plus SOC  (see Section  6.5 for details) .

AL 3. INTRODUCTION  
Sotatercept (A
CE-011) is a first -in-class human fusion protein consisti ng of the extra
cellular 
domain of the activin rec
eptor IIA  linke d to the Fc domain of 
human immunoglobulin G1 .  
Sotatercept works by [CONTACT_368573]
s in the transforming growth factor -beta (TGF -β) 
superfamily, which inclu
des activins and bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP s).  Aberrant TGF -β 
superfamily signaling is 
associated with a wide range of human pathologies, including 
autoimmune, fibrotic diseases, cance
r, and cardiovascular disorders such a s pulmonary arteri
al 
hypertension ( PAH ).  Disruptions in TG
F-β and BMP signaling are associat
ed with the 
development of PA
H.  
3.1. Study Rationale  
Study A011 -[ADDRESS_461303] of care 
(SOC) versus placebo p
lus SOC in adults with PAH  (World Health Organiza
tion [ WHO ] 
Group  1).  The study is divided int
o the Screening Period, Treatment Period, Extension P eriod , 
and Follow -Up Period.  
The design of this study will
 control bias in the assignment of study treatment as well as in data 
interpretatio
n, particularly of the measures that may have clinical variability (e.g., PVR  and 
6-minute -walk distance  [6MWD]).  
Rationale for Pa rticipant Population  
Patients with diagnostic WHO
 Group I PAH associated with idiopathic/heritable, drug -induced, 
connective tissue diseases , or post -shunt  correction  PAH within the WH
O functional c lass II-III 
PAH will be selected for this study.  PAH is cons idered a rare condition , with approxim ately 
80% of patients presentin
g as class II -III PAH.  It is expected that t
he treatment effect of 
sotatercept can be more easily detected in this pati
ent popula tion.  Patients with class I PAH are 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_368551]
d from interve
ntional studies due to the ir relative ly low identification  rate, low 
prevalence , and mild symptomatol
ogy.  Similarly, there  is a low prevalence of patients with 
class  IV PAH, and given their severe disease burden, those patients ha
ve limited ability to 
participate in longer 
interventional studies.   Eligibility crite
ria for this study are consistent with 
those of other studies in 
this popula tion. 
Rationale for Study Endpoints  
The primary endpoint is change in PVR at 24 weeks  Cycle 9 Day 1A (C9D1A)  as compared to 
the PVR value obtained during the Screening Period .  This analysis will  assess change in 
resistance to flow acro ss the pulmonary vasculatu re; a reduction is anticipate
d based on the 
activity of sotatercept in animal mod
els and the hypothesi zed mechanism 
of action and activity 
of sotatercept in pati
ents with PAH.  Secondary objectives in
clude evaluation of changes i
n 
6MWD , echocardiogram (ECHO) parameters , such as tricuspid annular plane syst

Acceleron Pharma Inc . Page 25 of 100 CONFIDENTIAL  Safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_256435]  (AEs)  and laboratory results , which will be 
graded for  severity using the current version of the Nationa l Cancer Institut e-Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI -CTCAE ; Appendix  7). 
Rationale for Comparator  
The choice of placebo as the comparator is to enable robust as sessments  of the effectiveness  and 
safety  of sotatercept in a controlled setting .  Participants  in the placebo group  (and sotatercept 
groups) will  be on stable doses of SOC  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_368553] s tudy, thus ensur ing that participants rand omized to t he placebo  arm 
are treated and managed as per esta blished treatment guidelines.  
Rationale for Dose and Frequency Selection  
Selection of the dose and frequency are based on estimates of biologically activ e sotatercept 
doses and frequencies studie d in several patient populations with other chronic diseases.   The 
doses proposed for the Phase 2 study in PAH are 0.3 and 0.7 mg/kg.   Dose s in this range have 
been associated with pharmacodynamic (PD) effects and an acceptable safety profile.  The 
projected mean exposure levels at the steady state are 93 day*μg/mL for AUC 21d and 5. 3 μg/mL 
for C max at 0.3 mg/kg every 21 days, and 217 day*μg/mL for AUC 28d and 12. 4 μg/mL for C max at 
0.7 mg/kg every 21 days.   Pharmacok inetic ( PK) modeling data showed every 21-day and every 
28-day dosing to be similar in terms of predicted  hemoglobin  (Hgb) response but different in 
regards to exposure.  
3.2. Background  
Genetic mutations in the bone morphogenetic protein receptor  type II (BMPR2 ) are associated 
with the majority of the familial form of PA H4,5 and approximately 25% of idiopathic PAH.  
Specifically, the impairment of the BMPR2 -associated signal p athway appears to lead to the 
uncontrolled proliferation of pulmonary vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), the principal  
cause of PAH.  These data strongly suggest a key role of TGF -β family mem bers in the 
pathogenesis of PAH .  Sotatercept acts to block activin ligands  and growth and differentiation 
factors ( GDFs ), may attenuate  BMPs,  and improve  pulmonary vascular remodeling by [CONTACT_368574] .6  
PAH applies to a group of di seases causing a progressive increa se in PVR, resulting in right 
ventricular dysfunction and ultimately failure as well as premature death .7,8  The PAH 
pathophysiology involves pulmonary endothelial dysfunction, resulting in impaired prod uction 
of vasodilators, such as nitric oxide and prostacyclin, and overexpression of vasoconstrictors, 
such as endothelin -1.  The pathophysiology of PAH also entai ls the abnormal proliferation of 
pulmonary VSMCs  in pulmonary arterioles, which results in pr ogressive pulmonary vascular 
remodeling, increased PVR  and, eventually, right -sided heart failure .9  In the absence of 
treatment, the majority of patients succumb to heart failure within a few years of diagnosis .10  
There is currently no pharmacological cure for  PAH; treatment involves relieving symptoms by 
[CONTACT_368575] e through pharmacologic mani pulation 
of various pathways  and slowing clinical worsening of the disease .  Current disease -specific 
treatment s for PAH include  vasodilator -type agents such as ERAs , phosphodiesterase  5 (PDE5)

(e.g., anticoagulants, diuretics, digoxin).  
Recent preclinical data suggest that sotatercept (murine analogue, RAP -011) may positively 
affect vascular remodel ling in  animal models of PAH.  Affected animals treated with  RAP -[ADDRESS_461304] vascular rem odelling.6 
A detailed description of the chemi stry, pharma cology, efficacy, and safety of sotatercept is 
provided in the Investig ator Brochure . 
3.3. Benefit/Risk Assessment  
The study will be conduct ed in participants  who require treatment for the management of PAH.  
The study design, inclusion/exclusion cr iteria, and procedures have been developed to protect 
participant  safety.  
The evidence for potential benefits comes from data observed in rodent models o f PAH.  These 
include reduced muscularization  and thickness of pulmonary vessel walls , reduced right -sided 
heart pressures, and r educed right -to-left ventricle weight ratios.  These improvements might be 
accompanied by [CONTACT_368576], which 
will also be measured during the study.  
Possible risks to participants  observed in prior clinical studies with sotatercept  include increase s 
in Hgb, hematocrit  (Hct) , red blood cell count  (RBC) , and blood pressure.  These will be 
diligently monitored during the study, and adjustment to dosing made as necessary (follow ing 
medical treatment) to ameliorate these risks.  Potential risks of development  of anti-drug 
antibodies , reproductive effects,  and renal injury , though not experienced as AEs in other 
sotatercept clinical studies (but observed in some preclinical studies ), will also be monitored.  In 
prior sotatercept clinical oncol ogy s tudies in chemotherapy -induced anemia and osteolytic bone 
disease in multiple myeloma; leukopenia, neutropenia (including febrile neutropenia), 
granulocytopenia, and thrombocytopenia have been described as treatment -emergent adverse 
events  (TEAEs) .  As a consequence of the decrease in white blood cells  (WBCs) , infection 
maybe a potential risk and as a consequence of the decrease in platelets, bleeding maybe a 
potential risk.  Per health aut hority request, leukopenia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia h ave

who discontinue the study e arly or decline transition to a future sotatercept long -term follow -up 
study.  The End of Study  is defined as when t he last participant completes the last visit.  
4.3. Justification for Dose  
For the current study, dose s of 0.3 and 0.7 mg/kg were selected and will be administered SC 
every 21 days ( i.e., every 3 weeks [ Q3W ]).  The projected m ean exposure levels at the steady 
state are 3.5 and 8.1 μg/mL for 0.3 and 0.7 mg/kg Q3W, respecti vely.  These projected exposures 
are comparable to those observed in healthy  volunteers who received SC 0.3  mg/kg Q4W 
(Cmax = 2.4 μg/mL) and 1.0 mg/kg doses Q4W (Cmax = 7.4 μg/mL).  In the current protocol, the 
starting exposure levels (i .e., after the first dose) are estimated to be approximately half of that at 
the steady state.  
Simulations based on population PK model show that there will be an adequate separation in the 
systemic sotat ercept exposure betwe en the currently selected doses of 0.3 and 0.7  mg/kg Q3W 
[mean (5th, 95th percentile ): 3.5 μg/mL (2.00, 4.90) v ersus 8.10 μg/mL (4.80, 11.4)].  This will 
facilitate the evaluation of the dose -response relationship for effectiveness and toxicity.

31 July 2020  
Acceleron  Pharma Inc.  Page 34 of 100 CONFIDENTIAL  Based on the safety data from the 2 completed Phase 1 studies  (A011 -01 and A011 -02), single 
doses of  sotatercept up to 3.0 -mg/kg intravenous ( IV) and multiple  doses of sotatercept up to 
0.3 mg/kg SC were generally well tolerated in healthy postmenopausal women.  Consistent with 
observations from nonclinical safety studies, many of the observed PD effects  in Phase 1 clinical 
studies were attri butable to the expected biologic activity of activin inhibition, i .e., 
dose-dependent decrease s in circulating follicle -stimulating hormone ( FSH), and transient, 
reversible effects on RBC  parameters.  In Study A011 -02, 1 participan t experienced persistent, 
progressive hypertension , which was reported as a treatment -related serious adverse event 
(SAE), together with  headaches approximately 1 week f ollowing her second dose of 1.0  mg/kg 
sotatercept SC that were a ttributab le to a rapid and s ignificant rise in Hgb.   
Using data fro m the se Phase [ADDRESS_461312] response  PK/PD  model for H gb following IV 
or SC administration of sotatercept  was developed.  The final PK/PD model was used to 
calculate the individual -predict ed values of H gb at each of the virtual sample times.  Summary 
statistics of H gb at steady state and the assoc iated sotatercept  concentrations were calculated 
stratified by [CONTACT_66067], dose  level , and dosing interval.  For simulations, PAH patients were 
assumed to be similar to healthy volunteers in terms of baseline H gb level  and likely H gb 
responses to s otatercept dosing.  Mean (90% confidence interval ) predicted steady state H gb was 
15.4 g/dL (13.7, 17) and 16.0 g/dL (14.4, 17.4) for 0.3   and 0.7 mg/kg Q 3W, respectively.  These 
projected H gb levels appeared to be simi lar to the H gb levels observed in 2 Phase 1 studies.  
Though simulations show that dose s in the range of 0.3   and 0.7 mg/kg are expected to be safe 
overall, AE rates due to sotatercept -mediat ed Hgb increases will  be further ameliorat ed by [CONTACT_368578], delay , and stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_368554] 
(Section  6.3).  In addition, a comprehensive safety monitoring pl an will be incorporated into the 
study to mitigate risk.  This will include comprehensive dose-modification guidance  as well as 
the incorporation of study oversight by [CONTACT_17588] a scientific steering committee as well as an 
independent DMC  to assess safety even ts on an on going basis.

[ADDRESS_461323] consists of sotatercept  in 10  mM citrate buffer, pH 5.8, 8% sucrose,  
and 0.02% polysorbate 80.  It is supplied  as a lyophilized powder  in labeled, rubber stoppered, 
3-mL glass vials.  The recommended storage temperature for sotatercept lyophilized drug 
product  is 2°C to 8°C.  Prior to  administration, the lyophil ized drug product is reconstituted  with 
[ADDRESS_461324] consists of a 50 mg/mL solution of 
sotatercept .  The reconstituted sotatercept , in its original container closure system,  may be held 
for up to 6 hours at  2°C to 8°C .  For details refer to the pharmacy manual provided under 
separate  cover.  
Placebo to be used in the study will be sterile normal saline (0.9% sodium chloride for injection).  
Sterile, normal sali ne should be supplied by [CONTACT_779] .  The investigational site’s designated 
individuals will prepare the placebo syringes to matc h the active syringes.  The investigator and 
participant s will be blinded  during the Treatment Period, and unblinded during the Extension 
Period (see Section 6.5 for additional details) .  The manufacturer’s direc tions for storage and 
handling are to be followed , as are standard clinical practices for ensuring ste rility of the 
placebo.  
Standard of care treatments will be provided  by [CONTACT_368581]  
(see Appendix  2 for more details on SOC) . 
6.2. Treatment Administration and Schedule  
There will be unblinded  site personnel at each site designated  for preparing the inv estigationa l 
product  during the Placebo -Control led Treatment P eriod .  Sotatercept or placebo will be 
administered  after reconstitution as an SC (subcutaneous) injection to participants  by [CONTACT_368582] , and administration will be doc umented in the study source record.  
Subcutaneous i njections will be given  in the upper arm, abdomen, or thigh.   Each injection will 
not exceed 1.0 mL; a minimum of 2 injections  will be required per dose.  Where rounding weig ht 
and total volume is necessar y, please  refer to the pharmacy manual and interactive response 
technology (IRT) manual for further details.  
Sotatercept dosing is weight  based , therefore , an overdose would only be considered if the dose 
exceeds the no -observed -adverse -effect level (NOAE L) = 1 mg/kg (for informatio n on overdose 
refer to Section  8.3.8 ).

Acceleron  Pharma Inc.  Page 41 of 100 CONFIDENTIAL  6.3. Dose Modification  
Dose delay and/or  reduction or discontinuation may be required in  any treatment arm 
(sotatercept or placebo).  Guidance for dose modifications and dose de lay are summarize d in 
Figure [ADDRESS_461325]  be directed  to the [COMPANY_003] medical monitor  for 
assessment .   
Results from the hematology panel should be evaluated prior to study treatment  administration.  
For C1D1,  C2D1, C9D1A/B, and C10D1 visits, blood samples should be taken and assessed for 
Hgb levels on the same day as study treatment  administration.  For all other dosing cycles, blood 
samples may be taken and assessed for Hgb levels on the same day as stud y treatment  
administration or 1 day prior.    
After the primary endpoint analysis,  dose modification guidelines were revised to address only 
changes in platelet and hemoglob in values  (Figure 2 and Figure 3).  If Hgb increases are 
> 4.0 g/dL above participant baseline value, consult the medical monitor  and consider study 
treatment discontinu ation.   
Dose delays and  reductions can be implemented for safety reason s at any time per investigator’s 
assessment, not being restricted to the dose modification guidance provided.

6.5. Randomization and Blinding  
Participants who have signed the informed consent and met all eligibility criteria will b e 
stratified by [CONTACT_368583], 
sotatercept 0.3  mg/kg  plus SOC, or  sotatercept 0.7 m g/kg plus SOC  in the Placebo -Controlled 
Treatment Period .  Randomization assignments will be generated  through a compu terized 
system, provided by [CONTACT_12067].  After the completion of th e 24-week Placebo -Controlled Treatment 
Period , placebo participants will be re-randomized 1:1  to treatment with sotatercept 0.3 mg/kg 
plus SOC or sotatercept 0.7 mg/kg plus SOC  and sotatercept -treated participants will continue on 
their current dose in the  Extension Period . 
Among stud y personnel, the pharmacist or his/her designee who prepares the study treatme nt 
(sotatercept or placebo ), and the study team at each site , and a sponsor clinical trial manager  
and/or designee will be unblinded to the participa nt treatment assignments  during the 
Placebo -Control led Treatment P eriod .  All other study personnel (including but not limited to the 
sponsor, the sponsor’s representatives, investigators, study coordinators, nursing staff, and 
clinical monitors) and all participant s will remain blinded to the study treatment assignments  
until all participants in the Treatment Period have completed t heir post -Placebo -Controlled 
Treatment Period (C 9D1A/ 24 week) PVR assessment . 
During the Extension Period, following the condu ct and results of the C9 primary endpoint, and 
the approval of Protocol A011 -09 Amendment 0 7D, study treatment will be unblind ed to study 
teams, investigators , and study participants.  Investigators will be provided with treatmen t 
assignments by [CONTACT_779] d esignee of study treatment .  All investigators will be allowed, at the 
investigator’s discretion, to increase study treatment  dose up to 0.7 mg/kg based on the 
investigator’s clinical assessment.  
In the event of a medical emerg ency for an individual partic ipant in which knowledge of the 
study treatment  is critical to the participant ’s medical management  (Section  8.3.4 ), the 
investigator may break the blind for that participant  by [CONTACT_368584]  (see the IRT User M anual

investigator is encouraged where possi ble to discuss with the study medical monitor  prior to  
breaking the blind.  Where the investigator has broken the blind without prior  discussion  they are 
requested to inform the sponsor/medical monitor  at the earl iest opportunity.  Further, it must be 
determined by [CONTACT_368585] .  If the blind is broken, the investigator can consult  with 
the medical monitor as needed .  Investigator discretion  should be used to determine  if the 
participant  should continue on treatment or be discontinued from the study.  
6.6. Packaging and Labeling  
The study treatment will be labeled per local require ments.  
6.7. Preparation/Handling/Storage /Accountability  
Accountability for the study treatment  that i s administered during the course of the study is the 
responsibility of the  investigator or designee.  Investigational clinical supplies must be received  
by a designated person at the clinical site and kept in a se cure and temperature -controlled 
location.  The investigational site must maintain accurate records demonstrating date s and 
amounts of study treatment  received, to whom it was adminis tered ( participant -by-participant  
accounting), and accounts of any sotatercept  accidentally or deliberately destroyed  or returned.  
Accurate recording of all study treatment  adminis tration will be made in the appropriate section 
of the participant ’s eCRF and source documents.  Unless otherwise notified, all vials of st udy 
treatment , both used and unused, must be saved fo r drug accountability.  The used vials may be 
discarded, per  the institution’ s standard practice, after drug accountability has be en completed b y 
the monitor.  The investigator must return all unused and expi[INVESTIGATOR_368558] t he end of the study, or the study treatment  may be  destroyed at the clinical site with 
the permis sion of the sponsor.  For either scenario, the outcome must be documented on the drug 
accou ntability log.  The sponsor or designee will provide direction for t he outcome of all unused 
vials.  
Acceleron  (or desi gnee) will review with the investigator and rel evant site personnel the process 
for the investigational product return, disposal, and/or destruction inc luding responsibilities for 
the site versus Acceleron  (or designee).  
Refer to the Pharmacy Manual for further instructions for the preparation of study treatments and 
information regarding the disposition of unused study treatments.  
6.8. Treatment Compliance  
Each dose of study treatment will be administered by [CONTACT_10530](s) at the clinical site by [CONTACT_368586] i n the study record.  Accurate recording of all study treatment 
administration will be made in the appropriate section of the participant’s eCRF and source 
documents.  The investig ator or designee is responsible for accountin g for all study treatm ent 
that is administered during the study.

Appendix  2 for more details regarding SOC) . 
6.9. Concomitant Therapy  
During the screening and throughout the Placebo -Controlled Treatment P eriod of the study, 
participants may take stable doses of medications for chronic conditions that are not specifically 
excluded by [CONTACT_760] .  If there is an immediate clinical need during the study to prescribe a 
new medication or a new dosage of an existi ng medica tion for either a new or worsening 
pre-existing condition, concurrent therapy may be administered at the discretion of the 
investigator.  If the new medication is a PAH -specific medication that is being added for clinical 
worsening during the Plac ebo-Cont rolled Treatment Period (i.e., rescue therapy ; please refer to 
Section  8.5.5  for suggested criteria), the investigator will need to discontinue study treatment  and 
perform EOT visit assessments as directe d by [CONTACT_760].  The investigator may consult the 
[COMPANY_003] medical monitor regarding what co nstitutes a stable dose or a chronic condition.   
Information regarding concomitant medications will be collected beginning after signing ICF  
and will include all medi cations taken during Screening Period  to C1D1 . 
During the Extension  Period , any concomitant medications including PAH medication and 
supplemental oxygen can be modified (removed, substituted, or dose adjusted) and  should be 
recorded in the concomitant medi cation eCRF.

The reason for treatment discontinuation/study withdrawal must be recorded in the 
corresponding partici pant’s eCRF .  The investigator must notify the sponsor and medical 
monitor when a participant has disco ntinued treatment or been withdrawn from the st udy.  All 
participants who are discontinued/withdrawn from the study prior to the EOT  visit should 
complete the tests and evaluation scheduled for the EOT  visit at the time of 
discontinuation/withd rawal and wi ll be asked to return to the cl inic to complet e the remaining 
follow -up EOS visit .  Additional safety assessments, including UA and hematology, as 
determined by [CONTACT_093], may be done at this time.  
7.1. Discontinuation of Study Tre atment  
Reasons that may  lead to discontinuation of study treatment include:  
• Completion of treatment  
• AE or SAE  
• Participant  request (withdrawal of consent)  
• Clinical worsening requiring rescue therapy with a PAH agent  
• Pregnancy  
• Protocol deviation  
• Study terminated by [CONTACT_456]  
• QTcF > 500  ms during the Treatment Period  
Clinical worsening, pregnancy, and QTcF > 500 ms will need to be recorded as an AE (see 
Section 8.3). 
The sponso r may terminate study treatment or a dose level after consultation with the 
investigator and the DMC  at any time for safety or administrative reasons.  The sponsor will 
terminate t he study if the occurrence of SAEs or other findings suggests an unacceptabl e risk to 
the health of the participant s.  Refer to Section  6.3, Dose Modification , for further information 
regarding AEs that can lead to discontinuation.  
7.2. Withdrawal from the Study  
Reasons that may lead to a p articipant ’s withdrawal from the study include:  
• Participant’s  request  (withdraw al of consent)  
• Screen failure  
• Participant ’s unwillingness or inability to comply with the protocol  
• An AE with an outcome of death  
• Lost to follow -up

baseline con dition , as per Section  8.3.[ADDRESS_461326] be taken if a participant  fails to return to  the clinic for a required 
study visit:  
• The site must attempt to contact [CONTACT_31823] t and reschedule the missed visit as 
soon as possible and counsel the participant  on the importance of maintaining the 
assigned visit schedule and ascertain whether or not the participant  wishes to and/or 
should continue in the study.  
• Before a  participant  is deemed lost to fol low-up, the investigator or designee must 
make every effort to regain contact w ith the participant  (where possible, 3 telephone 
calls and , if necessary , a certified letter to the participant ’s last known mailing 
address or local equiva lent methods).  These contact [CONTACT_14316] ’s study  record .

• Study procedures and the ir timing are summarized in the Schedule of Events (SoE) 
(Section  2). 
• No p rotocol waiver s or exemptions will be  allowed  for eligibility criteria.  
Assessments performed outside of their defined windows will be h andled as protocol 
deviations . 
• Immediate  safety concerns  should be discussed with the s ponsor immediately upon 
occurrence or awareness to determine if the pa rticipant should continue or 
discontinue study treatment . 
• Adherence to the study design requirement s, incl uding those specified in the SoE , is 
essential and required for study conduct.  
• All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm tha t potential 
participant s meet all eligibility criteria.  The investigator will maintain a screening  log 
to record details of all participant s screened and to confirm eligibility or recor d 
reasons for screening failure, as applicable.  
• Procedures conducted a s part of the participant’s routine clinical management 
(e.g., blood count)  and obtained before sig ning of the ICF  may be utilized for 
screening or baseline purposes provided the procedure s met the protocol -specified  
criteria and were  performed within the timeframe defined in the SoE  Treatment 
Period and the Extension Period . 
• All protocol assess ments are to be recorded on the participant’s source 
documentation.  
8.1. Screening Pr ocedures  
• Screening procedures are to be performed as per the SoE ( Section 2) and are to be 
completed and reviewed by [CONTACT_368589].  
• Procedures also include a review of participant’s medical, surgic al, and family 
history; collecting of d emogra phics, race, ethnicity ; medical record requests for 
external procedures . 
8.2. Efficacy Assessmen ts 
8.2.1.  Pulmonary Vascular Resistance  by [CONTACT_368590].  There will be a total of 
3 RHC s to assess pulmonary vascular resis tance ( PVR ).  The first RHC must be performed 
within 10 days prior to C1D1 (during the Screening Period) , and the second RHC should be 
performed  within 10 days prior to  the 24 weeks/ C9D1 A visit (during the Treatment Period).  The 
third RHC should  be performed within 3 days of C25D1 or at the next available dosing visit 
upon consent to Protocol Amendment 07D, up t o C33D1 (during the Extension Period ).  If a

[ADDRESS_461327] after other  assessment s (i.e., 6-minute -walk test [ 6MWT ]) have been 
completed  and prior to dosing .  
A participant will not receive more than 3 RHC assessments during the study.  
Right heart catheterization will be perfor med according to the RHC manual and will  assess  
several pro gnostic hemodynamic varia bles in addition to PVR, including right atria l pressure 
(RAP), mean pulmonary arterial pressure ( PAP), mean pulmonary wedge pressure ( PCWP), and 
cardia c output (CO ).  The following hemodynamic param eters will be assessed when the  
participant  is in a stable hemodynamic rest state (as dem onstrated by 3 consecutive PAP and CO  
measurements within 10% of each other) while the participant  is breathi ng ambient air or 
oxygen:  
• RAP, mean PAP, mean PCWP, systolic pulmonary artery pressure, di astolic 
pulmonary artery pressure, heart rate  
• CO measured in triplicate by [CONTACT_368591] (the 
same method must be u sed for all RHC  assess ments  for each participant ). 
Pulmonary vascular resistance will be calculated and populated in the eCRF .  Right ventricle 
pressure data from the RHC  with simultaneously recorded ECG recordings may  be collected and 
digitally s tored at sel ected sites.  
8.2.2.  Six-Minute -Walk Distance  
Six-minute -walk distance (6MWD ) will be measured by [CONTACT_941] 6MWT  during the Screening  Period 
and at mul tiple timepoints throughout the study  as per the  SoE.   During the Screening  Period , the 
6MWT is to be performed twice , at least [ADDRESS_461328] be within 15% of each other, based on the longer distance.  If the difference 
between the first  and second tests is > 15%, the test may be  repeated once  more , provided the 
repeat test is with in [ADDRESS_461329].   If the differenc e between the distances remains  
> 15%, the pa rticipant will be considered a screen failure.  If occurring on th e same day, the 
6MWT should be performed after  QoL and before RHC.  Appendix  3 provides further

AE can , therefor e, be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated w ith th e use of the study treatment  whether 
or not it is considered related to the study treatment . 
Abnormal laboratory  and other abnormal investigational findings (e.g. , physical exam, ECG) 
should not be reported as AEs unless they are associated with clinical s igns and symptoms, lead 
to treatment discontinuation , or are otherwise considered clinically relevant by [CONTACT_74169].  
In cases of surgical or diagnostic proc edures, the condition/illness leading to such a procedure is 
considered as the AE rather than  the procedure itself.  In the case of a fatality, the cause of death 
is considered as the AE, and death is considered as its outcome.  
Unexpected Adverse Event s 
An unexpected AE , the nature, severity, specificity, or outcome of which is  not consistent with  
the summary of product characteristics , is described in the IB under the Reference  Safety 
Information . 
Events Not to Be Considered as Adverse Events  
Pre-existing medical conditions/signs/symptoms present 30 days prior the Screening Period that 
do not wors en in severity or frequency during the study are defined as Bas eline Medical 
Condi tions, and are not to be considered AEs.  Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of 
pre-existing conditions, including the disease under study, that do not represent a clinicall y

Acceleron  Pharma Inc.  Page 52 of 100 CONFIDENTIAL  Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is any AE, occurring at any dose level/regimen and regardless of causality that:  
• Results in death . 
• Is life-threatening : Life -threatening means that the pa rticipant was at immediate risk 
of death from the r eaction as it occurred , it does not include a reaction , which 
hypothetically might have caused death had it occurred in a more severe form . 
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_153830] . 
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity : An AE is incapacitating 
or disabling if the experience results in a substantial and/or permanent disruption of 
the participant ’s ability t o carry out normal life functions . 
• Is a conge nital anomaly/birth defect : Congenital anomaly/birth defect in a child of 
a participan t or its partner that was exposed to study treatment  prior to conception or 
during pregnancy . 
• Other, is an imp ortant med ical event : An important medical event is an event  that 
may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_217368], based on appropriate medical judgment, it may jeopardize 
the participant and ma y require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of th e 
outcomes listed in the definitions for SAEs.  Examples of such medical events include 
allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at 
home, bl ood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], 
or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
For the purposes of reporting per regulations, any suspected transmission of an infectious agent 
via a medical product is by  [CONTACT_15094] a suspect ed unexpected serious adverse reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R) 
and should be re ported in an expedited manner as described in Section  8.3.7 . 
Events  Not to Be Considered as Serious Adverse Events  are Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] s for: 
• A stand ard procedure for protocol therapy administration.  However, hos pi[INVESTIGATOR_368559] a complication of therapy administration will be  
reported as an S AE. 
• Routine treatment or monitoring of the studied indication not associated with  any 
deterioration in condition.  
• A procedure for protocol/diseas e-related investigations ( e.g., surgery, scans,  
endoscopy, sampling for laboratory tests, bone marrow sampling).  However,  
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_27589] a complication of su ch procedures  
remains a reportable SAE.

Acceleron  Pharma Inc.  Page 53 of 100 CONFIDENTIAL  • A procedure that is planned ( i.e., planned prior to starting of treatment on the study); 
must  be documented in the source document and the eCRF.  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_368561] a complicati on remains a reportable SAE.  
• An elective treatment of a pre -existing condition unrelated to the studied indication.  
• Emergency outpatient treatme nt or observation that does not result in admission,  
unless fulf illing other seriousness criteria above.  
8.3.1.  Severity  
Investigators must eval uate the severity/intensity of AEs and SAE s according to the active minor 
version of the NCI -CTCAE v4.[ADDRESS_461332] be recorded as a separate event.  If a particular AE’s 
severity/intensity is not specifically graded, the investigator should apply the general guidelines 
for determination of Grade 1 through Grade 5 as listed in the NCI-CTCAE v4.0 co ver page 
(as shown below), using their best medical judgment:  
Grade 1:  Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated.  
Grade 2:  Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention  indicated; limiting 
age-appropriate instrumental activities of daily living (preparing meals, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_16208], using the telephone, managing money, etc.).  
Grade 3:  Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; hos pi[INVESTIGATOR_368562]; disabling; limiting self -care activities of 
daily living (bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking 
medications, and not bedridden).  
Grade 4:  Life-threatening consequ ences; urgent interve ntion in dicated.  
Grade 5:  Death related to AE.  
The term “severe ” is often used to describe the intensity of a specific event (as in mild, moderate  
or severe myocardial infarction); the event itself, however, may be of relatively minor medical  
signific ance (such as  severe headache).  This criterion is not the same as “serious ,” which is  
based on the participant /event outcome or action criteria associated with events that pose a threat 
to a participa nt’s life or functioni ng. 
8.3.2.  Relationship to Study Treatment  
The investigator must determine the relationship between the administration of study treatment  
and the  occurrence of an AE/SAE as  Not Suspecte d or Suspected as defined below.  Factors for 
the assessment of causal relationship include, but are not limited to,  the temporal relationship 
between the AE and the administration of study treatment , known side effects of study treatm ent, 
medical history, concomitant therapy, course of the underlying disease and pertinent study 
procedures.

Acceleron  Pharma Inc.  Page 54 of 100 CONFIDENTIAL  Not Suspected:  Means a causal  relation ship of the AE to study treatment administration is 
unlikely or remote, or other medications , therapeutic interventions, or underlying conditions 
provide a sufficient explanation for the observed event.  
Suspected:  Means there is a reasonable possi bility that the administration of  study treatment  
caused the AE.  ‘Reasonable possi bility ’ means  there is evidence to suggest a cau sal relationship 
between the study treatment and the AE. 
8.3.3.  Documentation and Method s of Detecting Adverse Events  and Serious Ad verse 
Events  
It is the responsibility of the investigator  to document all AEs that occur during the study.  
Participants  will be evaluated and questioned generally for AEs during the course of  the study, 
starting at the signing of the informed consent.  Care will be taken not to introduce bias when 
detecting AEs  and/or SAEs.  Open -ended and non -leading verbal questioning of the participant is 
the preferred method to inquire about AE  occurrences .  The investigator must report in detail all 
adverse signs and symptoms which are either volunteered by [CONTACT_3445] s or observed during or 
following the course of investigational product administration on the appropriate eCRF page.  
All clearly related si gns, symptoms, and abnormal diagnostic procedures results should  be 
recorded under 1 diagnosis.  All AEs and SAEs rep orted from the signing of the ICF to the EOS  
visit are to be reported and documented on the AE eCRF.   Any AE related to a protocol 
procedure should be marked as such on the eCRF . 
All AEs spontaneously re ported by [CONTACT_4538]/or in response to an op en question from 
study personnel or revealed by [CONTACT_4171], physical examination or other diagnostic procedures 
will be recorded on the AE eCRF .  Any clinically relevant changes in laboratory assessment s or 
other clinical findi ngs as described in Section  8.3.[ADDRESS_461333] be recorded on 
the AE eCRF.   AEs are to be followed for resolution as described in Section 8.3.5 . 
It is important that each AE report  include a description of the event, duration (onset and 
resolution dates), severity, relationship with  study treatment , any other potential causal factors, 
any treatment given or other action taken (incl uding dose modification or discontinuation o f 
study treatment ) and outcome.  In addition, SAEs should be identified and the appropriate 
seriousness criteria documented .  AEs categorized as SAEs must also be documented within the 
appropriate SAE section in the eCRF or a paper SAE form if the syst em is down or otherwise 
unavailable as described in Section 8.3.4 .  Note both methods should not be used beside each 
other ; the paper is for backup reporting only.  
Specific guidance can be  found in the CRF Completion Guidelines provided by [CONTACT_98634].  
8.3.4.  Documentation of S erious Adverse Events  
For all SAEs, an SAE form must be completed with as much information as possible and 
submitted within the timefra me descri bed in Section  8.3.6  (Notification about S AEs). 
When new significant information is obtained as well as when the outcome of an event is known, 
the investigator should record the information on a new SAE form.  If the participant  was 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], a summary from the investigator should be included as par t of the participant

be completed by [CONTACT_368592].  Names, ad dresses, 
email address es, telephone , and fax numbers for SAE reporting are located on the SAE Report 
Form and in the completion  instructions provided for the Investigator Site File.  When an SAE 
(or follow -up information) is reported by [CONTACT_756], a writte n report must be sent immediately 
thereafter by [CONTACT_3719] e mail.  Reporting procedures and timelines for follow -up information are  the 
same as for the initially reported SAE.  
Relevant pages from the eCRF may be provided in parallel (e.g., medical history, con comitant 
therapy).  In all cases, the information provided in the SAE Report Form must be consistent with 
the data that are rec orded in the corresponding sections of the eCRF.  
The investigator/reporter mus t respond to any request for follow -up information or to any 
question the sponsor or designee may have on the AE within the same timelines as described for 
initial reports.  This is necessary to permit a prompt assessment of the event by [CONTACT_23638] 
(as applicable) to allow the sponsor to meet regulato ry timelines associated with expedited 
reporting obligations.  
Requests for follow -up will usually be made by [CONTACT_368593], or an Acceleron pharmacovigilanc e representative who may contact [CONTACT_1275] d irectly to obtain clarification on a particularly critical event.  
8.3.7.  Safety Reporting to Health Authorities , Independent Ethics Co mmittees, 
Institutional Review Boards , and Investigators  
The sponsor will send  appropriate safety notifications to Health Authori ties in accordance with 
applicable laws and regulations.

[ADDRESS_461335] comply with any applicable site -specific require ments related to the 
reporting o f SAEs involving his/her participant s to the independent ethics committee ( IEC) that 
approved the  study.  
In accordance with International Council for  Harmonis ation (ICH) GCP  guidelines, the sponsor 
will inform the investigator of “findings that could adversely affect the safet y of participant s, 
impact the conduct of the study, or alter the IEC’s appro val/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_368563].”  
The sponsor will inform the in vestigator of AEs that are both serious and unexpected and are 
considered to be related to study treatment  (S[LOCATION_003]Rs).  The investigator should place copi[INVESTIGATOR_368564] i n the Investigator Site File.  National regulations with regard to Safe ty 
Report notifications to investigators will be followed.  
When specifically required by [CONTACT_368594], the sponsor will provide appropriate 
Safety Reports directly to the concerned lead IEC and will maintain records of these 
notifications.  When direct reporting by [CONTACT_368595]-specific regulations, the  investigator will be responsible for promptly notifying the 
concerned IEC of any  Safety Reports and for filing copi[INVESTIGATOR_368565].  
For studies covered by [CONTACT_368596] 2001/20/ EC, the sponsor’s 
responsibilities regarding the reporting of SAEs/S[LOCATION_003]Rs will be  carried out in accordance with 
that Directive and with the related Detailed Guidances.  
8.3.8.  Overdose  
An overdose is defined as the administration of a quantity of a medicinal prod uct given  per 
administration or cumulatively , which is above the maximum recommen ded dose according to 
the authorized product information . 
Sotatercept dosing is weight  based , and  therefore, for the purpose of this trial, an overdose is 
defined as any dose  that has  exposures in excess of the monkey NOAEL dose of 1 mg/kg (IB, 
Section 3.3 .2, Table 4) , which was also the highest dose tested in a human volunteer study 
(A011 -02) with resolvable AEs.  Any instance of overdose (suspected or confirmed and 
irrespect ive of wh ether or not it involved sotatercept) as defined in the protocol, with or  without 
an AE, must be communicated to Acceleron or a specified designee within 24  hours and be fully 
documented as an AE in the eCRF.  
There is no antidote for sotatercept,  and it i s not dialyzable from blood ; therefore , in case of 
overdose , participants  should be monitored/treated as per clinical practice based on symptoms of 
identified and potential risks as described in the IB. . 
8.3.9.  Transm ission of an Infectious Agent  
Definition: Transmission of an infectious agent via study treatment  administration.  Any 
organism, virus, or infectious particle (e.g., protein transmitting Transmissible Spongiform 
Encephalopathy), pathogenic or non -pathogeni c, is c onsidered an infectious agent.

Acceleron  Pharma Inc.  Page 57 of 100 CONFIDENTIAL  Transmission of an infectious agent may be suspected from clinical signs or sympt oms or 
laboratory findings indicating an infection in a participant  exposed to study treatment .  As in the  
case of suspected advers e reactions and adverse reactions, the terms suspected transmission and 
transmission are considered synonymous.  
In the contex t of evaluating a suspected transmission of an infectious agent via study treatment  
administration, care shoul d be taken to discrim inate,  whenever possible, between the cause (e.g. , 
injection/administration) and the source (e.g., contamination) of the infe ction and the clinical 
conditions of the participant  at the time of the infection (immune -suppressed /vaccine).  
Any instance of tra nsmission of an infectious agent must be communicated to Acceleron or a 
specified designee within 24 hours to the sponsor usin g appropriate channels (e.g. , electronic 
protocol i nquiry portal) and be fully documented as an AE in the eCRF, or as an SAE if an 
associated  SAE occurs (see Section 8.3 for further instruction s). 
8.3.10.  Pregnancy  
The investigator will  attempt to collect pregnancy information if a female participant  or a male 
participant ’s female partner becomes pregnant while th e participant  is participating in this study  
and up until [ADDRESS_461336] be submitted to the sponsor within 24 hours  of 
learning of t he pregnancy.  The participant  or partner will be followed for the outcome of the 
pregnancy.  Information  on the status of the mother and child will be forwarded to the sponsor or 
designee.  Generally, follow -up will be no longer than 6 to 8  weeks followin g the estimated 
delivery date.  Any premature termination of the pregnancy will be reported  as an AE .  
Abnormal pregnancy outcomes (e.g., spontaneous abortion  [includes miscarriage and missed 
abortion] , fetal death, stillbirth, congenital anomalies, ectopi c pregnancy , neonatal death ) are 
considered SAEs.   Any neonatal death that occurs within [ADDRESS_461337] to causality, as an SAE.   
• Details of all pregnancies in female participant s and female partners of male 
participant s will be collected after the start of study treatment and until [ADDRESS_461338] dose.  
• If pregnancy is reported, the investigator  must  inform the sponsor  within 24 hours of 
learning of the pregnancy and should follow the procedures out lined in Appendix  5. 
• Additional pregnancy, breastfeeding, and s perm/ovum donor infor mation are 
provided in Appendix  5. 
8.4. Monitoring of Identified, Potential , and Adverse Events of Special 
Interest  
The risks outlined below are consistent with the list in Sotatercept  IB (Edition 14.0).  The AESI s 
are considered important p arameters to be monitored in order to assess the overall safety of the 
PAH patient populati on, therefore, added for safety monitoring in the sotatercept clinical trial.  
The lab oratory  data and vital signs are monitored on an ongoing basis by [CONTACT_368597].  Laboratory data and AEs are measured as per the study  schedule

•Seminal fluid collection is optional; samples will be collected from male participants
 
who consent to this assessment.
•The investigator must review the laboratory report, document this review, and record 
any clinically relevant changes occurring during the study in the AE section of the 
eCRF.  The laboratory reports must be filed with the source documents.  Clinically 
significant abnormal laboratory findings are those not associated with the underlying 
disease unless judged by [CONTACT_41411]'s condition.
•All laboratory tests with values considered clinically significantly abnormal during
 
participation in the study or within [ADDRESS_461343] dose of study treatment 
should be repeated until the values return to normal or baseline or are no longer 
considered clinically significant by [CONTACT_10982].
−If such values do not return to normal/baseline within a period of time judged 
reasonable by [CONTACT_093], the etiology should be identified and the sponsor 
notified.
−All protocol-required laboratory assessments, as defined in Appendix 1, must be 
conducted in accordance with the laboratory manual and the SoE.

Acceleron  Pharma Inc.  Page 63 of 100 CONFIDENTIAL  − If laboratory values from non-protocol -specified laboratory assessments 
performed at the institution’s local labo ratory require a change in participant  
management or are considered c linically significant by [CONTACT_093] ( e.g., SAE 
or AE or dose modifi cation) , then  the results must be recorded in the eCRF.  
8.6. Pharmacokinetics  
• Serum samples will be collected for measu rement of serum  concentrations of 
sotatercept  as specified in the SoE.  Instructions for the collection and handling of 
biological samples wil l be provided by [CONTACT_456] .  The actual date and time 
(24-hour clock time) of each sample will be recorded . 
• Samples will be used to evaluate the PK of sotat ercept.  Samples collected for 
analyses of sotatercept serum  concentration may also be used to eva luate safety or 
efficacy aspects related to  concerns ar ising during or after the study . 
Drug concentration inform ation that may unblind the study will not be reported to investigative 
sites or blinded personnel until the study has been unblinded . 
8.7. Pharmacod ynamics  
Venous blood samples will be collected for measurement of PD biomarkers including but not 
limited to activin A, BMPR2 , BMPR2  expression (via peripheral blood mononuclear cells), 
GDF15, matrix metalloproteinase -2 (MMP2 ), N-terminal prohormone of bra in natriuretic 
peptide ( NT--proBNP ), TGF -β1, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor ( VEGFR1 ), and sex 
hormone metabolites at timepoints listed in the SoE .  Samples collected for NT -proBNP  analyses 
may also be used to evaluate safety or efficacy aspect s related to concerns arising dur ing or after 
the study.  
8.8. Genetic Testing  
Participants may op t to have a genetic sample taken to assess the mutation status and allele  
frequency (e.g. , BMPR2 ) at C1D1 .  Since genetic  mutations in BMPR2 are associated with PAH , 
this testing  may provide  insigh t into the genetic basis of PAH  and potential response to 
sotatercept .  Other potential genetic analyses include, but are not limi ted to, activin receptor -like 
kinase 1, caveolin 1, eukaryotic translation initi ation factor 2-alpha kinase 4, endoglin, potas sium 
channel subfamily K member 3, potassium channel subfamily K member 5, and mothers against 
decapentaplegic homolog 9; otherwise known as SMAD9 .  See Appendix  [ADDRESS_461344] seminal fluid 
samples taken to assess sperm count, sperm motility, and sperm morphology.  Since the effec ts 
of sotaterce pt on fertility are unknown, these analyses may provide insight into changes 
sotatercept may mediate in sperm concentration or function.  The initial baseline sample will be 
taken during the screening period, and a sample will be collected f or comparison  at the EOS 
visit.  If there is a clinically si gnificant difference between the baseline and EOS samples with

Acceleron  Pharma Inc.  Page 65 of 100 CONFIDENTIAL  9. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
9.1. Sample Size Determination  
The sample size calculation is based on the primary endpoint of change from base line PVR 
measurement.  The baseline  PVR is expec ted to be approximately  800 dyn sec/cm5 (standard 
deviation 400) .  Assuming a decrease  from baseline PVR at 24 week s of 240 dyn sec/cm5 (30%) 
for sotatercept groups and 0 % for placebo, with 1 -sided alpha=0.10 and 80% power, the sample 
size is 26 per  treatment group.  The dropout rates may be different from 3 treatment groups.  The 
placebo group and 0.3 mg/kg sotatercept  group may have about a 15% dropout rate, but the 
0.7 mg/kg sotatercept  group may have an increased dropout rate due to potenti al Hgb increase 
based on PK modeling (about 20% more) and hence the total dropout rate in this group may be 
about 35%.  Thus, t he total sample after accounting for dropouts in the 3 arms: placeb o, 0.3 
mg/kg sotatercept, and 0.7 mg/kg sotatercept is 3 :3:4, respectively, for a total of 100.  
For the 6MWD at [ADDRESS_461347] deviat ion of 50 meters,  n = 26 per 
treatment group will provide approxi mately 80% power to detect the difference at 1 -sided 
alpha  = 0.10 level.  
9.2. Populations for Analyses  
Full Analysis Set (FAS) : All randomized participants  treated with correct treatment assignmen ts. 
Evaluable Population:  All participants  in the FAS who receive d at least [ADDRESS_461348]-Placebo -Controlled Treatment Period PVR assessment s (24 weeks/C9D1A) or EOT PVR 
assessment .  Data from participants whose dose is down -titrated will be analyzed according to 
the dose received rather than the dose to which they were origi nally assigned.   
Safety Population : All randomized participants  who receive at least 1 d ose of study treatment.  
Participants  will be analyzed according to  the treatment they actually received.  
9.3. Statistical Analyses  
The statistical analysis plan (SAP ) will be developed and finalized before topline (24  weeks)  
database lock and will describe the  participant populations  to be included in the analyses, and 
proced ures for accounting for missing, unused, and spurious data  as needed .  This section  is a 
summary  of the planned statistical analyses of the primary and key secondary endpoints .  A 
separate SAP for the Extension Period analysis will be developed and finaliz ed before the final 
database lock.

Endpoint  Statistical Analysis Methods  
Primary  ANCOVA  will be used to compare the 24 -week  (C9D1A)  change from baseline  PVR 
data between sotatercept  and placebo groups, with the randomization factor as the 
covariate.   The primary analysis will be performed on the evaluable populati on.  The 
non-evaluable rate will be blindly monitored, and adjustments to statistical methods  
may be considered based on this blinded data, as necessary.  Gatekeepi[INVESTIGATOR_368566] 1 error rate, i.e., higher sotatercept do se group will 
be compared with the placebo group at 1 -sided alpha  = 0.[ADDRESS_461349].  If significa nt, then 
the lower sotaterc ept dose will be c ompared with the placebo group at 1 -sided alpha  = 
0.10.   If the sotatercept higher and lower dose gro ups data are si milar, they may be 
combined together to compare with the placebo group.  
Key 
Secondary  6MWD  will be analyzed similarly as the primary endpoin t of the evaluable population .  
ANCOVA  will be used to compare the 2 4-week  (C9D1A) 6MWD from baseline 
(C1D1)  6MWD data between sotatercept  and placebo groups, with the randomization 
factor as the covariate.   The gatekeepi[INVESTIGATOR_368567] [ADDRESS_461350] ratio will be estimated  with the 
Cox regression method.  
6MWD  = 6-minute -walk distance; ANCOVA  = analysis of covariance; CMH  = Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel; 
CxDy  = Cycle x D ay y; PVR  = pulmonary vascular resistance .  
9.3.2.  Safety Analyses  
All safety analyses will be performed on the Safety Pop ulation.  
Adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA ).  Adverse event listings will include t he verbatim term and the MedDRA preferred 
term.  TEAEs  will be defined in the SAP and summarized by [CONTACT_368602], system 
organ class, and preferred term.  TEAE s leading to death or discontinuation from treatment, 
TEAEs related to investigationa l product, and serious TEAEs will be summarize d separately.  
Clinical laboratory results will be summarized descriptively b y treatment groups.  Clinica lly 
significant laboratory abnormalities will be listed and summarized by [CONTACT_1570].   Renal 
function  laboratory  tests (creatinine and urine al bumin -creatinine ratio ) will be collected

Immunogenicity (incidence/titer of anti -drug an tibody) will also be analyzed . 
9.3.3.  Other Analyses  
Pharmacokinetic , PD, and biomarker exploratory analyses will be described in the  SAP that will 
be fin alized before database lock.  Other analyses include the change in PVR from baseline, 
similar to the primary analysis , but on the FAS population and incorporating methods for 
handling missing data as detailed in SAP.

Acceleron  Pharma Inc.  Page 69 of 100 CONFIDENTIAL  [IP_ADDRESS].  Delayed -start Efficacy  Analysis  
The primary analysis is to compare the change from base line (PVR -ext – PVR0) between the 
Continued sotatercept  treatment group and the Place bo-Crossed treatment group to evaluate 
disease -modifying effect with a type I error rate of [ADDRESS_461356] stratified by [CONTACT_368604]0 will be used.  
Multiple imputation method will be used to handle the missing data.  
The key secondary analysis is to co mpare change from baseline (6MWD -ext – 6MWD0)  
between the Continued sotatercept  treatm ent group and Placebo -Crossed treatment group after 
the successful testing on primary PVR analysis with a type I error rate of 2 -sided 0.025.  
ANCOVA will be used with 6M WD0 and FC0 as covariates.  The normality che ck and missing 
data handling method will be similar to the primary analysis.  
The other secondary analysis is to compare FC -ext improvement from baseline (FC0) between 
the Continued sotatercept  treatment group an d Placebo -Crossed treatment group after the 
successful testing on primary PVR and key secondary 6MWD analysis, with a type I error rate of 
2-sided 0.025.  Cochran -Mantel Haenszel ( CMH ) test will be used with FC0 as the stratum.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Placebo -Crossed Efficacy Ana lysis 
The primary analysis is to evaluate PVR -ext – PVR [ADDRESS_461357] the intercept with 
PVR 0-average  (PVR 0) as the covariate.  Normality w ill be tested using  Shapi[INVESTIGATOR_2152] -Wilk test.  If 
normal distribution is rejected, a non -parametric Wilcoxon sig ned rank test will be used.  
Multiple imputation method will be used to handle the missing data.  
The key secondary analysis is to evaluate 6MWD -ext - 6MWD [ADDRESS_461358] the intercept with 6MWD 0-average  (6MWD 0) as 
the covariate.  The normality check and m issing data handlin g method will be similar to the 
primary analysis.  
The other secondary analysis is to e valuate FCn -ext – FCn0 in the Placebo -Crossed treatment 
group after the successful testing on primary PVR and key secondary 6MWD analysis, with a 
type I error rate of [ADDRESS_461359] the intercept with FCn 0-average  
(FCn 0) as the  covariate.  The FC categories are converted to numerical values, I  = 1, II = 2, 
III = 3, and IV  = 4.  The numerical values will be used in this analysis.  This conversio n is made 
in order to increase the statistical power of the ANCOVA analysis.

turnaroun d points should be marked (e.g., with a cone).  A starting line, which marks the 
beginning and end of each 60 -meter lap, should be marked on the floor (e.g., using brightly 
colored tape ). 
The 6-minute -walk distance will be calculated and recorded.   If the participant discontinues the 
test prematurely, the time (mm:ss) and distance walked will be recorded.   Requirement of acute 
supportive rescue medication (e.g., oxygen therapy ) and any adverse  events (AEs) occurring 
during the 6MWT will be recorded.  If a participant is on chronic oxygen therapy, oxygen should 
be given at t heir standard rate or a s directed by [CONTACT_093].  During the study the 6MWT 
should be done about the sa me time of day  to avoid diurnal variation.  
REQUIRED EQUIPMENT  
1. Countdown timer (or stopwatch)  
2. Mechanical lap counter  
3. Two small cones to mark the tu rnaround points  
4. A chair that can be easily moved along the walking course

1. Repeat testing should be performed about the same time of day to minimize intraday  
variability.  
2. A “warm -up” period before the test should not be performed.  
3. The participant  should sit at rest in a chair, located near th e starting position, for at least 
[ADDRESS_461371] 
in the source documents . 
4. Measure and recor d baseline heart rate and oxygen sat uration (SpO 2) and follow  
manufacturer's instructions to maximize the signal and to minimiz e motion artifact.  
Make sure the readings are stable before recording.  Note pulse regularity and whether  the 
oximeter signal qua lity is acceptable.  
Instruct the Participant as Follows : 
“The object of this test is to walk as far as possible for [ADDRESS_461372] without hesitation.  Now I'm going to show you.  Please  watch 
the way I turn without hesitation. ” 
Demonstrate by [CONTACT_270876] 1 lap yourself.  Walk and pi[INVESTIGATOR_53643] a round a cone briskly.  
“Are you ready to do that?  I am going to use this counter to k eep track of the number of laps you 
complete.  I will click it each time you turn around at this starting line.  Remember that the  
object is to walk AS FAR AS POSSIBLE fo r 6 minutes, but don't run or jog.   Start now, or 
whenever you  are ready. ” 
1. Position the  participant  at the starting line.  You should also stand near the starting line 
during the test.  Do not walk with the p articipant .  As soon as the participant  starts to 
walk, start  the timer.  
2. Do not talk to anyone during the walk .  Use an e ven tone of voice when using the 
standard phrases of encouragement.  Watch the participant .  Do not get distracted and 
lose count of the laps.  Each time the participant returns to t he starting line, click the lap  
counter once (or mark the lap o n the works heet).  Let the participant see you do it.   
Exaggerate the click using body language, like using a stopwatch at a race.  
After the first minute, tell the p articipant the following (in  even t ones): “You are doing well.  
You have 5 minutes to go .” 
When the timer shows 4 minutes remaining, tell the participant  the following: “Keep up the good 
work.  You have 4 minutes to go .”

When the timer shows only 1 minute remaining, tell  the participant : “You are doing well.  You 
have only 1 minute to go .” 
Do n ot use other words of encouragement (or body language to speed up).  
If the participant  stops walking during the test and needs a rest, say this: “You can lean against 
the wall i f you would like; then continue walking whenever you feel  able.”  Do not stop t he 
timer.  
If the participant  stops before the 6 minutes are up and refuses to co ntinue (or you decide that 
they should not continue), wheel the chair over for the participan t to sit on, discontinue the walk, 
and note on the worksh eet the distance, the time  stopped, and the reason for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_113989].  
When the timer is 15 seconds from completion, say this: “In a moment I'm going to tell you to 
stop.  When I do, just stop  right where you are and I will come to you .” 
When the timer rings (or buzzes), say this: “Stop!”  Walk over to the participant .  Consider 
taking the chair if they look exhausted.  Mark the spot where they stopped by [CONTACT_1299] a bean bag 
or a pi[INVESTIGATOR_113990].  
Post-Test:  
1. Measure SpO [ADDRESS_461373] the additional distance covered (the number of meters in the final partial lap)  
using the mark ers on the wall as distance guides.  
4. Calculate the total distance walked,  rounding to the nearest  meter, and record it on the 
worksheet.  
5. Congratulate the  participant  on good effort and offer a drink of water.

PREGNAN CY INFORMATION  
Definitions  
Woman of Childbearing Potential (WOCBP)  
A woman is considered  fertile following menarche and until becoming post menopausal  unless 
permanently sterile  (see below) . 
Women in the following cate gories are not considered WOCBP : 
1. Premen archal  
2. Premenopausal female with 1 of the following:  
• Documented hyster ectomy  
• Documented b ilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656]  
• Documented bilateral oophorectomy  
Note: Documentation can come from the site personnel’s: review of the participant ’s 
medical records, medi cal examination, or medical history interview.  
3. Postmenopausal female  
• A post menopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative 
medical cause.  A high follicle -stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the 
postmenopausal range may be us ed to confirm a post menopausal state in women not 
using hormonal contraceptio n or hormon e replacement therapy (HRT).  However , in 
the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insufficient.  
• Females on HRT and whose menopausal status is in do ubt will be required to use [ADDRESS_461376] discontinue HRT to allow 
confirmation  of postmenopausal status before  study enrollment . 
Cont racept ion Guidance  
Male Participants  
Male participants wi th female partners of childbearing potential are eligible to participate if they  
agree to 1 of the following ( during the protoco l-defined ti me frame in Section  5.1): 
• Are abstinent from penile -vaginal intercou rse as their usual and preferred lifestyle 
(abstinent on a long -term and persistent basis) and agree to remain abstinent  
• Agree to use a male condom  when having penile -vaginal intercourse with a WOCBP  
who is not currently preg nant 
Men with a pregnant or breastfeeding partner must agree to remain abstinent from penile -vaginal 
intercourse or use a male condom during each  epi[INVESTIGATOR_368569] a minimum  of [ADDRESS_461377] do se of study treatment.   Refrain from

A vasectomized partner is a highly effective contraception method provided that the partner is 
the sole male sexual partner of the WOCBP and t he absence of sperm has been confirmed.  If 
not, an additional highly effective method of contraception should be used.   
• Sexual Abstinence  
Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from 
heterose xual intercours e during the entire period of risk associated with the study treatment.  
The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relat ion to the duration of the 
study and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant.

Acceleron  Pharma Inc.  Page 87 of 100 CONFIDENTIAL  Collection of Pregnancy Information  
Male Participants with Partners Who Become Pregnant  
• The investigator will attempt to collect pregnancy information on any male 
participant’s female partner who becomes pregnant while the male participant is in 
this study.  
• After obtaining the necessary signed infor med consent from the pregnant female 
partne r directly, the investigator will record pregnancy information on the appropriate 
form and submit it to the sponsor within 24 hours of learning of the partner’s 
pregnancy.  The female partner will also be followed  to determine the outcome of the 
pregnancy.   Information on the status of the mother and child will be forwarded to the 
sponsor.  Generally, the follow -up will be no longer than 6 to 8  weeks following the 
estimated delivery date.  Any termination of the pr egnancy will be reported regardless 
of fetal status (presence or absence of anomalies) or indication for the procedure.  
Female Par ticipants Who Become Pregnant  
• The investigator will collect pregnancy information on any female participant who 
becomes pregna nt while participating in this study.  Information will be recorded on 
the appropriate form and submitted to the sponsor within 24  hours of learning of a 
participant's pregnancy.  The participant will be followed to determine the outcome of 
the pregnancy.  The investigator will collect follow -up information on the participant 
and the neonate and the information will be forwarded to t he sponsor.  Generally, 
follow -up will not be required for longer than 6 to 8 weeks beyond the estimated 
delivery date.  Any t ermination of pregnancy will be reported, regardless of fetal 
status (presence or absence of anomalies) or indication for the proc edure.  
• While pregnancy itself is not considered to be an AE or SAE, any pregnancy 
complication or elective termination of a pr egnancy will be reported as an AE or 
SAE.  A spontaneous abortion is always considered to be an SAE and will be reported 
as such.  Any post -study pregnancy related SAE considered reasonably related to the 
study treatment by [CONTACT_368611] d to the sponsor as described in 
Section  8.3.10 .  While the investigator is not obligated to actively seek this 
information in former study participants, he or she  may learn of an SAE through 
spontaneous reporting.  
• Any female participant w ho becomes pregnant while participating in the study will 
discontinue study treatment .

Use/Analysis of Deoxyribonucleic Acid  
• Genetic variation may impact  a participant’s response to therapy, susceptibility  to, 
and severi ty and progression of disease.  Variable response to therapy may be due to 
genetic determinants that impact drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and 
excretion; mechanism of action of the drug; disease etiology; and/or molecular 
subtype of the disease  being treated.  
• Optional deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA ) samples that are collected will be used for 
research related to PAH .  They may also be used to develop tests/assays including 
diagnosti c tests related to  sotatercept and PAH.   Genetic research may consi st of the 
analysis of 1 or more candidate genes or the analysis of genetic markers throughout 
the genome (as appropriate).  
• DNA samples that are collected will be analyzed for bone morphogenetic protein 
receptor type I I (BMPR2 ; and other potential genes of interest) mutational status and 
variant allele frequency  at baseline . 
• The samples may be analyzed  as part of a multi -study assessment of genetic factors 
involved in the  response to sotatercept  or study treatments of this class to understand 
study disease o r related conditions.  
• The optional genetic samples will be tested to characterize any association s between 
mutational status of pulmonary hypertension genes and the res ponse of participants to 
study treatment , as well as potential susceptibility to, severi ty and progression of the 
disease in aggregate.   Summary tables and figures will be g enerated to facilitate the 
understanding of the data.  There is no anal ysis plan to focus on specific individual 
mutational information.  The planned genetic analysis will  help the future 
development of sotatercept in the indication of PAH.  
• The results of  genetic analyses may be reported in the clinical study report or in a 
separate study summary  and may be shared with regulatory authorities such as the 
Food and Drug Admin istration and the European Medicines Agency . 
• The sponsor will store the DNA samples in a secure storage space with adequate 
measures to protect  confidentiality.   All optional genetic samples collected will be 
analyzed at the bioanalytical lab oratory  shortl y after receipt.  Any remnants from the 
analysis will be stored until end of the study or as per local regulations.   The 
information obtain ed from individual participants will be de -identified by [CONTACT_368612] a unique participant identifier ( participant  number) prior to shipment to 
the anal ysis lab oratory .

13 October 2014  Version : Final  Page:   [ADDRESS_372142], a targeted alpha- pharmaceutical (a 
radiopharmaceutical emitting alpha radiation), is a ready -to-use solution for  
intravenous injection containing the drug substance radium chloride. The 
active moiety is the alpha particle emitting nuclide R a-223, present as a         
divalent  cation (223Ra2+).  
Dose                                  
Doses are given as kiloBecquerel (kBq) per kilogram body weight, with the 
corresponding dose given in millicurie (mCi) per kilogram in parenthesis. The term “dose” is used to describe the quant ity of radioactivity  from R a-223 
dichloride administered.  
 
1. Introduction 
1.1 Background 
Ra-223 dichloride is potentially a very low toxicity and high efficacy targeted agent 
for osteosarcoma, an osteoblastic bone- forming tumor. Because of low marrow 
toxicity of  this radiopharmaceutical, knowledge of the MTD in this patient population 
is needed to develop future protocols. Use of Ra- 223 dichloride in osteosarcoma 
should reduce the morbidity of therapy and mortality from metastases. The goal of 
this initial study is to determine the safety of escalating doses of monthly 223RaCl 2 in 
osteosarcoma patients with osteoblastic bone- forming metastases until MTD or a 
dose 100 kBq/kg dose is reached (whichever is first).  Ra- [ADDRESS_372143] , Na18F and/ chest CT.  Evaluations will include 
anatomic imaging (CT or MRI) of all sites of disease along with chest CT at baseline and restaging for all patients to allow for assessment of RECIST progression.  RECIST progression will determine progress ive disease regardless of other imaging. 
If well tolerated at the MTD, an additional 6 patients will be studied to better define toxicity and obtain data to support future investigation of Ra- 223 dichloride with other 
agents and modalities (e.g. other drug s, surgery or external beam RT) for improved 
treatment of osteosarcoma.

was about 1 year [ 1] Although chemotherapy may possibly contribute to longer 
overall survival after first relapse, surgery is critical to prevent subsequent relapses. Thus for patients with axial, recurrent, or metastatic osteosarcoma, more effective 
treatments are needed.  
 Ra-223 dichloride is an alpha- emitting radi opharmaceutical 
developed by [CONTACT_304246][INVESTIGATOR_304232] (figure 1).

 The intrinsic bone targeting property of Ra- 223 dichloride is similar to calcium and 
other alkaline earth elements. Tables 2 and 3 show how the 223Ra alpha- particle 
emitting radiopharmaceutical has different radiation dose characteristics than the 
current FDA approved beta- emitting radiopharmaceuticals such as 89SrC l2 and 
153Sm-EDTMP [2]. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_304233] 153Sm-EDTMP for treatment of high- risk 
osteosarcoma [3-8], Radium -[ADDRESS_372146] very significant advantag es 
(less marrow toxicity and repeated dosing without stem cell support possible) 
compared to 153Sm-EDTMP.  Radium -223 dichloride emits alpha- particles with high 
energy and high linear energy transfer (LET) radiation with a range limited to less 
than [ADDRESS_372147], the 89Sr and 153Sm emit beta- particles (electrons) that have much lower 
energy and lower LET. Beta radiation mainly induces single- strand breaks to DNA 
which are more easily repaired. In addition, beta- particles typi[INVESTIGATOR_44769] 30- [ADDRESS_372148] to collateral damage from beta- emitters. For example after radiation from 
beta- emitters, nearby [CONTACT_304247], 
leucopenia, and thrombocytopenia.   
 
Rationale for dose level being studied  
Ra-223 has been extensively studied in prostate cancer, with a median age of > 65. 
Osteosarcoma occurs in adolescent and young adults and for this type of disease, an osteoblastic bone- forming tumor, perhaps a higher dose would have a better 
efficacy in terms of its direct bone targeting properties.  Because of low marrow toxicity of this radiopharmaceutical, knowledge of the recommended dose in this patient population is needed to develop future protocols.

Figure 2. Decay cascade of Ra- 223. The initial ejection of the high LET alpha 
particle takes a relatively long time (t=11.4 days). Subsequent quick decay of radon 
daughters prov ide additional alpha particles quickly with for increased  therapeutic 
effectiveness at target location of emission (bone- forming tumor cell in the case of 
osteosarcoma) and little changece for diffusion of radon daughters to other locations/tissues for non- target effects.   
 
1.3 Ra-223 dichloride  
1.3.1  Preclinical 
In single and repeated dose tox icity studies in rats, the main findings were 
reduced body weight gain, hematological changes, reduced serum alkaline phosphatase and microscopic findings in the bone marrow (depletion of hematopoietic cells, fibrosis), spleen (secondary extra- medullary hematopoiesis) 
and bone (depletion of osteocytes, osteoblasts, osteoclasts, fibro- osseous 
lesions, disruption/disorganization of the physis/growth line). These findings  
were 
related to radiation- induced impairment of hematopoiesis and a reduction of 
osteogenesis and occurred beginning in the dose range of 20 (0.[ZIP_CODE] mCi) –  80 
kBq (0.0022 mCi) per kg body weight, with the exception of body weight 
decreases. 1 2

 Dose -limiting myelotoxicity was seen in dogs after single administration of 450 
kBq (0.012 mCi) Ra-223 dichloride per kg body weight  (9 times the clinically 
recommended dose).   
Osteosarcomas, a known effect of bone- seeking radionuclides, were observed at 
clinically relevant doses in rats 7 –  [ADDRESS_372149] not been performed

No histological changes were observed in organs involved in the excretion of R a-
223 dichloride. No significant effects were seen on vital organ systems, i.e. 
cardiovascular (dog) , respi[INVESTIGATOR_209529] (rat), after single 
dose administration of 450 to 1000 kBq (0.012  to 0.027 mCi) per kg body weight

toxicities, dosimetry, biodistributi on and PK in patients with bonemetastases 
mainly from prostate cancer; and it included some patients with MBC with bone metastases. The Phase II program included three completed studies of R a-[ADDRESS_372151] bone 
metastases.  The results of the completed studies indicated that safety and 
tolerability of R a-223 dichloride in CRPC/HRPC patients with bone metastases 
was well tolerated, and that there was evidence of  dose related efficacy against 
bone markers and other markers of disease. In addition there was an effect on median overall survival in a Phase II (BC1 -02) placebo- controlled study. These 
studies enabled the initiation of the Phase III ALSYMPCA (ALpharadin in 
SYMptomatic Prostate CAncer) study.  
 
 
    
13 October 2014  Version : Final  Page:   [ADDRESS_372152] been evaluated in a 
double- blind, randomized, multiple dose, phase III  multicenter study 
(ALSYMPCA) in castrat ion-resistant prostate cancer patients with bone 
metastases. The primary efficacy endpoint was Overall Survival (OS).  
At the cut -off date of the pre- planned interim analysis, a total of 809 patients 
were randomized 2:1 to receive Ra -223 dichloride 50 kBq (0.0014 mCi)/kg 
intravenously every 4 weeks for 6 cycles (N=541) plus best standard of care or 
matching placebo plus best standard of care (N=268). Best standard of care included e.g. local external beam radiotherapy, corticosteroids, antiandrogens, estrog ens, estramustine or ketoconazole.  
An updated descriptive analysis of safety and of OS was performed in 921 randomized patients prior to implementing crossover (i.e. offering patients in the placebo group to receive Ra -223 dichloride treatment).  
The resul ts of both, interim and updated analysis, revealed that OS was 
significantly longer in patients treated with Ra -[ADDRESS_372153] of care (HR =0.695 (95% CI 0.581/0.832), median OS 14.9 months versus 11.3 months, respectively).  
The results of the interim analysis and the updated analysis showed also a significant improvement in all main secondary endpoints in the Ra- 223 dichloride 
arm compared to the placebo arm:  
Time to SRE ( to be update based on final results) -  As with good practice, 
the sponsors have conducted further verification of the ALSYMPCA SRE 
data in preparation for the US FDA NDA regulatory submission. This has 
resulted in changes in the numbers previously reported for SRE data in the ASCO 2012 abstracts (Abstract #4551, LBA #4512). Though discrepancies were noted, the overall interpretation of the results has not changed. The SRE data will be disclosed once all additional data verification and analyses activities are completed.”  
Prolonging the time to total ALP progression (defined as ≥ 25% increase 
compared to baseline/nadir) (Interim analysis: HR  = 0.163, 95% CI 0.121 –

was not reached at the time of data cut -off; updated analysis: HR  = 0.167, 
95% CI 0.129 –  0.217; median number of months = 7.4 months for Ra -223 
dichloride versus 3.8 months for placebo).  
Time to PSA progression (defined as a ≥ 25% increase and an increase in absolute value of ≥ 2 ng/mL compared to baseline/nadir ) was also

 significantly prolo nged in patients receiving Ra -223 dichloride compared to 
patients receiving placebo (Interim analysis: HR  = 0.671, 95% CI 0.546 –  
0.826; p = 0.[ZIP_CODE], median number of months = 3.6 months for Ra -223 
dichloride versus 3.4 months  
Total ALP response (confirmed ≥ 30% reduction compared to baseline) at 
week 12 compared to the placebo group (Interim analysis: 43.3% in the 
Ra-223 dichloride group, 2.5% in the placebo group, p < 0.001; updated 
analysis: 46.9% in the Ra -223 dichloride group, 3.3% in the placebo 
group).  
Most common non- hematologic all grades adverse events occurring in more than 
15% of patients were: bone pain (43% vs. 58%), diarrhea (22% vs. 13%), nausea (34% vs. 31%), vomiting (17% vs. 13%) and constipation (18% vs. 18%).  Most common hematologic all  grades adverse events were anemia (27% vs. 27%), 
neutropenia (4% vs. 1%) and platelets (8% vs. 6%).  
Subgroup survival analysis  
Subgroup survival analysis showed a consistent survival benefit for treatment with Ra-223 dichloride, independent of total alkal ine phosphatase (ALP), current 
use of bisphosphonates, prior use of docetaxel and baseline ECOG status.

Preclinical work showed that mice had signific antly less marrow toxicity from Ra -223 
dichloride  than after the beta- emitting radiopharmaceutical strontium -89 chloride [ 9, 
10]. Alpharadin has shown promising marrow -sparing properties in patients with 
bone metastases of hormone refractory prostate cancer [ 2, 11, 12]. In a placebo 
controlled trial, patients with hormone refractory prostate cancer bone metastases 
had no significant effects on blood counts after r epeated monthly Ra -223 dichloride 
doses (50kBq/kg) [ 12].   
 Bone marrow sup pression from Ra -223 dichloride has been minimal . Alkaline 
phosphatase in patients wit h prostate cancer bone metastases after 
223Ra 
decreased was 66% v ersus increase of 9% in placebo treated patients  (p=0.001) 
[12]  Time to PSA progression was 26 v ersus 8 weeks (p=0.048).  A large phase III 
multicenter, randomized, double blinded, placebo controlled trial in p rostate cancer is 
underway and includes centers in Europe and the [LOCATION_003] [13]. Results of Alpharadin 
against prostate cancer bone metastases in two randomized phase II studies were 
reviewed at ASCO 2011 by [CONTACT_304249]. [ 14]. Alkaline phosphatase normalization 
was dose- related in trial BC1- 04: 5/29 (17% in 25 kBq/kg group, 10/25 (40%) in the 
50kBq/kg group, and 10/21 (48%) in the 80 kBq/kg group. Alkaline phosphatase normalization was associated with significantly improved median survival (58 weeks 
vs 102 weeks (log rank p=0.0086).   
 
Alkaline phosphatase is a marker not only of bone formation associated with 
metastases to bone in osteosarcoma, but also the intrinsic bone forming activity by [CONTACT_304250]. Mialou et al. found that not only bone (vs lung) metastases, but also high alkaline phosphatase (>500 IU) was 
significantly associated with a worse outcome in metastatic osteosarcoma [ 15].  An 
alpha- emitting targeted radiopharmaceutical  located in osteosarcoma target tissue  
will deliver the radiation to a much more localized tumor volume than a beta- emitter, 
thereby [CONTACT_304251].  
 Thus a dose finding study to determine best dose for monthly Alpharadin dosing in 
osteosarcoma is proposed. This information can then be used to develop potential 
“game -changing” strategies against osteosarcoma to improve pain in metastatic 
patients, make surgery better (fewer amputations, better function), and reduce the 
considerable morbidity of current therapy,

 • Any condition which, in the investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], makes the subject 
unsuitable for trial participation.  
• Concurrent anti -cancer therapy (chemotherapy, radiation therapy,     
surgery, immunotherapy, biologic therapy, or tumor embolization)  
• Patients on oxygen 
5.[ADDRESS_372161] be withdrawn from the trial (treatment and procedures) for the 
following reasons:  
• Subject withdraws consent from study treatment and study procedures.  A subject must be removed from the trial at his/her own request or at the request of his/her legally acceptable representative.  At any time during the trial and wit hout giving reasons, a subject may decline to participate 
further.  The subject will not suffer any disadvantage as a result.  
• Progressive disease and dose limiting toxicity (DLT)  
• Subject is lost to follow -up. 
• Death.  
Subjects  may be  withdrawn from the study  for the following reasons:  
• The subject is non- compliant with study drug, trial procedures, or both; 
including the use of anti -cancer therapy not prescribed by [CONTACT_17143].  
• Pregnancy.  Pregnancy will be reported as an SAE.  (Note: subjects who have been withdrawn from treatment with study drug because of 
pregnancy should not undergo CT scans [with contrast]/M RI or bone 
scans while pregnant. ) 
• If, in the investigator's opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], continuation of the trial would be harmful to the subject's well -being . 
• The development of a second cancer.  
• Development of an intercurrent illness or situation which would, in the judgment of the investigator, significantly affect assessments of clinical status and trial endpoints.

 • Deterioration of ECOG performance status to 4.  
• Use of illicit drugs or other substances that may, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_1070], have a reasonable chance of contributing to toxicity or otherwise skewing trial result . 
Any subject removed from the trial will remain under medical supervision until discharge or transfer is medically acceptable.  
In all cases, the reason for withdrawal must be recorded in the CRF and in the subject's medical records.  
5.2.2  Screen Failures/Dropouts 
A subject who discontinues study participation prematurely for any reason is defined as a “ dropout” if the subject has already been assigned to treatment  and 
administer ed at least one dose of study drug . 
A subject who, for any reason ( e.g. failure to satisfy the selection criteria), 
terminates the study before the time point  used for the definition of “dropout” (see 
above) is r egarded a “screening failure”.  
5.2.3  Replacement  
 
Subjects/patients who discontinue from the study for reasons unrelated to the study (e.g., personal reasons or disease progression) will be replaced as required for the study to meet its objectives. The decision to remove a subject/patient and 
to replace dropouts will be made by [CONTACT_1704]. Both the replacement and originally allocated number will be unique numbers.  
 
6. Treatment  
6.1 Treatments to be administered:  
Monthly doses of Radium-223 -dichloride  
6.2 Treatment assignment 
Patients will be screened with c linically appropriate tests for study inclusion.  A 
patient number (a unique identification number  from CORe in MD Anderson) will 
be assigned after  a patient  is eva luated for inclusion into the study  and signs 
informed consent after successful screening.

 6.2.1  Radium-223 dichloride 
6.2.2  Treatments to be administered 
Ra-223 dichloride will be ad ministered as a slow bolus IV injection at intervals 
of every 4 weeks for up to 6 cyc les. 
 
 
• Dose (50, 75, or 100 kBq/kg) will be assigned in cohorts of 3 after study 
registration in CORe . 
• Dose #1 should be given within 30 days of study registration   
• At least 3  patients will be required to successfully complete 6 weeks of 
therapy before advancing to the next cohort.   
• Patients will receive the same Ra- 223-dichloride dose as dose #1 for all 
subsequent doses.  
• Monthly dosing (q 4 weeks +/ - 6 days) as slow iv bolus for up to a total of 6 
doses  
• Monthly doses will be delayed, but no more than 2 weeks from scheduled 
dose for any grade 3 hematologic toxicity.   
Criteria for subsequent doses  (i.e. doses 2- 6):  
 
• Hematologic Toxicity (if present): Hb, ANC, and platelets - resolved to grade 2 
or less within 6 weeks of prior dose. Since lymphopenia may be chronic, this 
will not be a criteria for subsequent doses  
• All toxicities must be resolved to grade 2 or less in order to begin subsequent cycles 
• Performance status ECOG 0 to 2  
• Alkaline phosphatase stable or improving  at the discretion of the treating 
physician   
• Not on oxygen  
• Not pregnant  
• After dose #3 and b efore dose #4: stable disease or better in indicator lesions 
as determined by [CONTACT_304253] (18FDG PET -CT, 
quantitative 99mTc-MDP SPECT/CT, or Na18F PET/CT) or RECIST criteria on 
anatomic imaging  (note: often osteosarcoma “indeterminate” lesions 1- [ADDRESS_372162] technique).  
• Anatomic imaging (CT or MRI) of all sites of disease along with chest CT at baseline and restaging for all patients will be done to allow for assessment of RECIST progression.  
• RECIST progression will determine progressive disease regardless of other imaging.  
 
 
    
13 October 2014  Version : Final  Page:   [ADDRESS_372163] of the protocol, prior to advancing/changing dose levels, a 
cohort summary must be completed and submitted to the Clinical Research Monitor in the IND Office.  
6.2.[ADDRESS_372164] is isotonic  and has a pH of 6.0- 8.0. The 
radioactive concentration at the reference date is 1000 kBq/mL.  The product 
has a pre- calibration of [ADDRESS_372165] manufacturer: Institute for Energy Technology, Isotope 
laboratories, Kjeller, Norway. The product is produced according to Good 
Manufacturing Prac tice (GMP). The product will be delivered in a glass vial, 
ready -to-use with a certified activity.  Ra-223 dichloride is shipped in a lead 
container and Type A radioactive package according to international transportation guidelines  for radioactive materials.   
 The volume per vial is 6 mL, corresponding to 6 MBq at  the calibration day. Ra-
223 dichloride has a shelf life of 28 days from production day, when stored at 
ambient temperature.  The shelf life has been demonstrated for temperatures 
from cold storage (2- 8°C) up to 40°C.  In addition, it has been shown that the 
product quality is not jeopardized upon freezing.  
 All study drugs will b e labeled according to the requirements of local law and 
legislation. For all study drugs, a system of numbering in accordance with all 
requirements of GMP will be used, ensuring that each dose of study drug can be traced back to the respective bulkware of  the ingredients.  
 
6.2.[ADDRESS_372166] parties is extremely low, due to the short range of the alpha particles 
(<100 μm) and the low portion of beta and gamma radiation. For these 
 
    
13 October 2014  Version : Final  Page:   [ADDRESS_372167] been received by [CONTACT_456], a 
vial of Ra -223 dichloride for technical use will be s ent to the study center.  
 
Different clinical study centers possess dos e calibrators fr om various suppliers; 
thus, the isotope calibration factor may differ from center to center.  
Consequently, each center must perform the Ra- 223 dichloride dial setting on 
their relevant dose calibrator(s). For dial setting, the clinical stud y center will 
receive a sealed vial containing a Ra -[ADDRESS_372168] 
responsibility as assigned from the Primary Investigator for handling and 
storage of Ra- 223 dichloride. Control measurements of both the Ra- 223 
dichloride vial (before and after dispensing) and syringes (before and after 
administration) are performed as part of the clini cal trial documentation. All 
administrations of Ra- 223 dichloride are based on the certified activity of Ra-
223 dichloride at the calibration date.  
6.2.7  Dose calculation 
The dosage of Ra- 223 dichloride is 50, 75, or 100 kBq/kg body weight. The 
total activi ty to be injected will be calculated volumetrically using the patient’s 
body weight on the day of injection (kg), the 50 kBq/kg body weight dosage 
level, and the decay correc tion factor (DK) to correct for physical decay of Ra-
223 dichloride. A table with DKs according  to physical decay of the study 
medication will be provided with each vial of Ra- 223 dichloride.  The total 
amount (volume to be drawn into the syringe) to be administered to a patient should be calculated as follows:  
 
    
13 October 2014  Version : Final  Page:   20 of 46 
 
20 
  
Body weight (kg) x50 kBq/kg  = volume to be injected (mL)    
DK x 1000 kBq/mL   
 
Data regarding activity should be recorded on the appropri ate electronic case 
report form (eCRF) page.  
6.2.8  Dose preparation 
Personnel should use appropriate protective clothing and equipment during syringe filling and application to prevent contamination with the radioactive solution (medical gloves / protective glasses). The usage of shielded syringes is strongly recommended; however, this decision will be dictated by [CONTACT_304254]. Filling of 
the syringe should take place in a safety bench or similar cabinet in the Radiopharmacy/ Nuclear Medicine department. The individual responsible for study drug preparation will draw the correct volume of study drug into a syringe. The size of the syringe should be chosen according to the applied volume to reach the required dosing accuracy. Ra- [ADDRESS_372169] be well hydrated; the patient should be instructed to drink ad libitum.  Aseptic technique should be 
used in the administration of Ra- 223 dichloride. The syringe should be handed 
over to the individual who will perform the injection. The study medication will be administered as a slow bolus intr avenous (IV) injection. After 
administration, the equipment  used in connection with the preparation and 
administration of drug is to be treated as  radioactive waste and should be 
disposed in accordance with hospi[INVESTIGATOR_304237] e 
material. Written information about Ra- [ADDRESS_372170] been previously 
investigated (see also ATI -BC-1: blood pharmacokinetics; BC1- 05: 
pharmacokinetics, biodistribution and radiation dosimetry; Algeta ASA). After intravenous injection of 2Ra -223 dichloride, then radiopharmaceutical is quickly 
eliminated from blood, taken up in bone and excreted via the small intestine. The major route of elimination is through the gut with the feces; at 48 hours only 1- 5% 
was excreted in urine and the rate of urinary excretion was decreasing. Thus, the 
kidneys, urinary bladder, and urethra are exposed to a minimal amount of radiation. 
 
    
13 October 2014  Version : Final  Page:   21 of 46 
 
21 
 Gamma scintigraphy images show early activity in the gut, decreasing at the later 
images. It is not possible to determine the relative activity within gut wall versus  gut 
contents from the scan, but it is assumed that the activity is mainly confined to the gut contents (i.e. fecal stream). This is a reasonable assumption since the activity in the scans is seen to move along the gut. No specific uptakes were seen in any other 
normal organs such as the heart, the liver, the kidney, the gallbladder, stomach and the spleen. The highest absorbed doses were measured in the bone with lesser amounts in the red marrow.   Biosampling (blood tests)  In the first week after injection of Ra -223 dichloride, there may be radioactivity in 
body fluids. A considerable fraction of the study drug is eliminated via feces, and to a lesser degree via urine. B lood clearance after injection is very rapid (<1% remaining 
[ADDRESS_372171] injection). To ensure radiation protection for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11530], special attention should be directed to ensure that only necessary samples of blood, urine and feces should be handled during the first week after administrati on. In case 
of necessary unforeseen blood samples, laboratory personnel should be notified in order to avoid contamination. All patients in clinical trials with Ra-[ADDRESS_372172] 
after administration of Ra -223 dichloride. The range of α-particles in human tissue is 
£ 0.1 mm. Once injected, both α - and β-particles emitted from Ra -223 are stopped 
by [CONTACT_102]’s tissue. Due to attenuation in the patient’s body mass, the radiation 
outside the patient’s body is extremely low and there should be no safety issues 
related to homeland security /airport travel .  Nevertheless patients should have a 
letter or card indicating recent treatment with a radioisotope in case of detection in by [CONTACT_304255] (advice: wear clean underpants!). Dose rates 
(µSv/h per MBq injected) measured outside the body are ~200 at one centimeter   
and 0.02  at one meter [16] 
 Ra-[ADDRESS_372173] case scen arios are assumed. When crematorium workers receive a body that 
contains any type of radioactivity, they should be suitably trained, informed 
 
    
13 October 2014  Version : Final  Page:   22 of 46 
 
22 
 beforehand and given suitable personal protection equipment (i.e. universal blood 
and body fluid precautions - especially when handling ashes containing potentially 
radioactive bone fragments.  Calculations and the rationale for radiation dose estimates are available upon request ( see investigators Brochure).  
 
Definition of Dose -Limiting Toxicities (DLTs):  
 
Toxicities  will be graded in severity according to the guidelines outlined in the NCI  
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 (publish date 28-May-2009). Dose- limiting toxicities include all adverse experiences that are 
related to study medication, and clearly not related to disease progression or intercurrent illness.   Based on prior experience with other bone seeking radiopharmaceuticals and Ra-
223 dichloride in prostate cancer patients, the expected dose limiting toxicity (DLT) will be hematologic.   Lymphopenia is common in patients with bone metastases and 
will be monitored, but not considered a DLT in this protocol.  Any grade 4 anemia, 
any grade 4 neutropenia for >7 days or grade 4 neutropenia with fever (a single temperature greater t han 38.3˚C or a sustained temperature of ≥ 38˚C for more than 
one hour) and grade [ADDRESS_372174] cycle.  
 
Dose Modification and Escalation  
Every effort should be made to administer the full dosing regimen of Ra -223 
dichloride.  Adjustment of dose level is not permitted.   
• A minimum of [ADDRESS_372175] dose level.  
• If at least [ADDRESS_372176] a dose- limiting toxicity (DLT), the 
MTD will have been exceeded and no further patients will be enrolled at this 
dose level or at any higher dose level.  The prior dose level is  defined as the 
MTD (unless only [ADDRESS_372177] been treated at that level, in which case it is the tentative MTD).  
• If [ADDRESS_372178] DLT during the DLT assessment period, the dose level is escalated one step for the next cohort of 3 patients, and the process continues as above.  
 
    
13 October 2014  Version : Final  Page:   23 of 46 
 
23 
 • If exactly 1 of the 3 patients treated show DLT during the DLT assessment 
period, 3 additional patients are treated at the current dose level.  
• If none of these additional 3 patients show DLT during the DLT  assessment 
period, the dose level is escalated for the next cohort of 3 patients, and the 
process continues as above; otherwise, the prior dose level is defined as the MTD (unless only [ADDRESS_372179] been treated at that level, in which case it is the te ntative MTD).  
• A tentative MTD becomes final when a total of 6 patients are treated with less 
than 2 showing DLT.  
• If [ADDRESS_372180] hematologic DLT, then next cohort will be dose 
level -1. 
Study visits during the treatment period should occur at 4 weeks intervals 
(within a window of +/ - 7 days).  Dosing delays  may be instituted under the 
following circumstances:  
Disease progression:  
The Investigator should delay cytotoxic chemotherapy, other systemic 
radioisotope, hemibody external radiotherapy or other investigational drug until the follow -up period.  If such treatments have to be given during the treatment 
period, further study drug administrations must be discontinued.  Patients with 
disease progression may continue other treatment at the I nvestigator’s 
discretion.  
Myelosuppression:   
Treatment -related changes in hematology parameters may occur.  
• Blood transfusion is acceptable between study drug administrations.  
Use of biologic response modifiers, such as G -CSF or GM- CSF, is allowed in 
the management of acute toxicity.  
• If myeloid growth factors are required for the management of acute 
toxicity this event should be considered a DLT.  
Gastrointestinal events:  
Diarrhea should be treated as per local practice.  A further dose of study 
medication should not be given before diarrhea is recovered to CTCAE v4.03 Grade 2 or baseline levels.  
 
    
13 October 2014  Version : Final  Page:   24 of 46 
 
24 
 Nausea or vomiting should be treated as per local practice.  A further dose of 
study medication should not be given before nausea or vomiting is recovered to CTCAE v.4.03 Grade 2 or baseline levels.  
For any grade 3 hematologic toxicity for >[ADDRESS_372181] be discontinued (grade 4 events of anemia and neutropenia >7 days are dose- limiting).  
Spi[INVESTIGATOR_304238]:  
If the patient experi ences spi[INVESTIGATOR_209534], 
the patient should be treated for the event, and this will be considered disease progression.  
Surgical Intervention:  
If surgery is required, the patient should continue with study treatment, if thi s is 
considered safe in the treating Investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649].  The surgeon needs to be notified that the patient has been given radioactive drug, and needs to follow the guidelines for radioactive protection.   
Non-pathological fractures:  
For traumatic frac tures in weight -bearing bones during treatment phase, the 
study drug administration should be delayed for 2- 4 weeks from the time of 
fracture.  
Pathological fractures:  
Pathological fractures may occur as the result of either progressive disease or 
increased physical activity associated with significant pain palliation.  Pathologic fractures are to be treated in a manner that attempts to maintain the best functional status and quality of life. Study treatment may continue as planned.  
Any Other Toxicity:  Loc al practice will apply.  
 
6.3 Drug logistics and accountability  
All study drugs will be stored at the investigational site in accordance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and Good Manufacturing Practices ( GMP ) 
requirements and the instructions given by [CONTACT_304256].  
 
    
13 October 2014  Version : Final  Page:   [ADDRESS_372182] of the inventory and disposition of the agent (investigational or free of charge) using the NCI Drug Accountability Record or another comparable drug accountability form. (See the CTEP website at http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment

Accountability and Storage of Investigational Agents” or to obtain a copy of  the 
drug accountability form.)  
6.3.[ADDRESS_372183] 
may be discontinued from the trial for non- compliance with follow -up visits or 
study drug.  
6.5 Prior and concomitant therapy - 
During treatment, all concomitant medications (including start/stop dates and indication) must be recorded i n the patient's medical record and case report 
form ( DMI) 
Permitted  
• Treatment with non- conventional therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] ( e.g., herbs [with the exception 
of St. John’s Wart ], acupuncture) and vitamin/mineral supplements is 
acceptable provided that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], such treatment will not interfere with the trial endpoints.  
• Subjects may receive standard of care for any underlying illness.  
• In the event of neutropenia, anemia, or thrombocytopenia, subjects may receive appropriate supportive care (e. g., transfusion, biologic response 
 
    
13 October 2014  Version : Final  Page:   26 of 46 
 
26 
 modifiers such as G -CSF or GM- CSF, prophylactic antibiotics, antifungals 
and/or antivirals, hematopoietic growth factors).  This supportive care 
should not substitute a recommended dose modification.  
• Blood transfusions and erythropoietin are allowed during the study period  
• If surgery is required during study drug treatment, the surgeon needs to be notified that the patient has been treated with a radioactive product and adequate precautions for radioactive protection should be applied during the surgical procedure.  The patient should continue with study treatment if considered safe in the treating Investigator's opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649].

 [IP_ADDRESS]  Definitions  
Definition of adverse event (AE)  
In a clinical study, an AE is any untoward medical occurrence ( i.e. any 
unfavorable and unintended sign [including abnormal laboratory findings], 
symptom or disease) in a patient or clinical investigation subject after providing written informed consent for participation in the study.  Therefore, an AE may or may not be temporally or causally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product.  
A surgical procedure that was planned prior to the start of the study by [CONTACT_39708] (however, the condition for which the surgery is required may be an AE  if the condition worsens compared to 
baseline).  
 
• Conditions  that started before signing of informed consent and for which no 
symptoms or treatment are present until signing of informed consent  are 
recorded as medical history ( e.g. seasonal allergy without acute complaints).  
• Conditions  that started before signing of informed consent and for which 
symptoms or treatment are present after signing of informed consent, at 
unchanged intensity , are recorded as medical history  (e.g. phantom pain) . 
• Conditions  that started or deteriorated after signing of informed consent will be 
documented as adverse events . 
Definition of serious adverse event (SAE)  
An SAE is classified as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose, meets any 
of the following criteria (a – f): 
a. Results in death.  
b. Is life -threate ning. 
The term ‘life -threatening’ in the definition refers to an event in which the 
patient was at risk of death at the time of the event, it does not refer to an 
event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.  
 
    
13 October 2014  Version : Final  Page:   [ADDRESS_372190] one of the following exceptions is met:  
- The admission results in a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8932] 12 hours . 
- The admission is pre- planned.   
(i.e. elective or scheduled surgery arranged pri or to the start of the study)  
- The admissi on is not associated with an AE.  
(e.g. social hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8933]).  
However, it should be noted that invasive treatment during any hospi[INVESTIGATOR_304239] ‘medically imp ortant’ and as such may be reportable 
as an SAE dependent on clinical judgment.  In addition, where local regulatory authorities specifically require a more stringent definition, the local regulation takes precedence.

[IP_ADDRESS].1  Seriousness  
 
    
13 October 2014  Version : Final  Page:   31 of 46 
 
31 
 An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” if, in the 
view of either the investigator or the sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes:  
• Death 
• A life -threatening adverse drug experience 
• Any adver se experience that places the patient, in the view of the initial 
reporter, at immediate risk of death from the adverse experience as it occurred.  It does not include an adverse experience that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death  
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
• A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions  
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect  
 
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life- threatening, or 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a serious adverse drug experience when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical interventi on to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, 
blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospit alization, or the 
development of drug dependency or drug abuse (21 CFR 312.32).  
 
Important m edical events as defined above may also be considered serious 
adverse events. Any important medical event can and should be reported as an SAE if deemed appropriate  by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_304240], IND Office.  
 
All events occurring during the conduct of a protocol and meeting the definition of a SAE must be reported to the IRB in accordance with the timeframes and procedures outlined in “Universit y of [LOCATION_007] M. D. Anderson Cancer Center 
Institutional Review Board Policy for investigators on Reporting Serious 
Unanticipated Adverse Events  for Drugs and Devices ”.  Unless stated otherwise in 
the protocol, all SAEs, expected or unexpected, must be report ed to the IND Office, 
regardless of attribution (within 5 working days of knowledge of the event).  
 
 
    
13 October 2014  Version : Final  Page:   32 of 46 
 
32 
 • All life -threatening or fatal events,  that are unexpected, and related to the 
study drug, must have a written report submitted within 24 hours  (next working  
day) of knowledge of the event to the Safety Project Manager in the IND Office.   
 
Unless otherwise noted, the electronic SAE application (eSAE) will be utilized 
for safety reporting to the IND Office and MDACC IRB.  
• Serious adverse events will be captured from the time of the first 
protocol -specific intervention, until [ADDRESS_372191] returned  to 
baseline, progression of the event has stabilized, or there has been acceptable resolution of the event.  
 
• Additionally, any serious adverse events that occur after the [ADDRESS_372192] be reported to the I ND 
Office. This may include the development of a secondary malignancy.  
 
 
Reporting to FDA:  
 
• Serious adverse events will be forwarded to FDA by [CONTACT_9533] (Safety 
Project Manager IND Office) according to 21 CFR 312.32.  
 It is the responsibility of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_180689], Good Clinical Practices, the protocol guidelines, the sponsor’s guidelines, and Institutional Review Board policy.  
 
 
For each AE, the seriousness must be determined according to the criteria given in 
Section [IP_ADDRESS] . 
[IP_ADDRESS].2  Intensity  
The intensity of the AE is classified according to the CTCAEv4.0.  Grade refers to the severity (intensity) of the AE:  
CTCA Ev4 Grade 3: Severe or medically significant but not immediately life 
threatening; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_39676]; disabling; limiting to self care ADL (self care ADL refers to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self , using the toilet, taking medications, and not 
bedridden).  
CTCAEv4 Grade 4: life -threatening consequences; urgent intervention is 
indicated.  
 
    
13 October 2014  Version : Final  Page:   33 of 46 
 
33 
 CTCAEv4 Grade 5: death due to an AE.  
[IP_ADDRESS].3  Causal relationship  
The assessment of the causal relationship between an AE and the administration of 
treatment is a clinical decision based on all available information.  
The causality assessment should be done separately for each study treatment . 
The assessment is based on the question whether there was a “reasonable causal relationship” to the study treatment in question.  
Possible answers are “yes” or “no” . 
An assessment of “no” would include:  
1. The existence of a clear alternative explanation, e.g.  mechanical bleeding at 
surgical site.  
or 
2. Non-plausibility, e.g. the subject i s struck by [CONTACT_23634]; cancer developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a few days after the first drug administration.  
An assessment of “yes” indicates that there is a reasonable suspi[INVESTIGATOR_39677].  
Factors to be considered in assessing the relationship of the AE to study treatment include:  
- The temporal sequence from drug administration:  The event should occur after the drug is given.  The length of time from drug exposure to event should be 
evaluated in the clinical context of the event.  
- Recovery on drug discontinuation (de- challenge), recurrence on drug re-
introduction (re- challenge):  
- Subject’s response after de- challenge or subjects r esponse after re- challenge 
should be considered in the view of the usual clinical course of the event in question.  
- Underlying, concomitant, intercurrent diseases:   Each event should be evaluated in the context of the natural history and course of the disease being treated and any other disease the subject may have.  
- Concomitant medication or treatment:  The other drugs the subject is taking or the treatment the subject receives should be examined to determine whether any of them may be suspected to cause the event in question.  
 
    
13 October 2014  Version : Final  Page:   34 of 46 
 
34 
 - The pharmacology and pharmacokinetics of the study treatment:  
The pharmacokinetic properties (absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion) of the study treatment, coupled with the individual subject’s pharmacodynamics should be considered.  
[Causal relationship to protocol -required procedure(s)]  
The assessment of a possible causal relationship between the AE and protocol -
required procedure(s) is based on the question whether there was  a “reasonable 
causal relationship” to protocol -required procedure(s).  
Possible answers are “yes” or “no” . 
[IP_ADDRESS].4  Action taken with study treatment  
Any action on study treatment to resolve the AE  may be documented using the 
categories listed below.  
־ Drug withdrawn 
־ Drug interrupted 
־ Dose reduced

[IP_ADDRESS]  Assessments and documentation of adverse events  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Reporting of serious adverse events  
The definition of serious adverse events (SAEs) is given in Section [IP_ADDRESS] . 
Each seri ous adverse event must be followed up until resolution or stabilization, by 
[CONTACT_39718]. An isolated laboratory 
abnormality that is assigned grade 4, according to CTC definition, is not reportable as an SAE;  unles s the investigator assesses that the event meets standard ICH 
criteria for an SAE.  CTC grade 4 baseline laboratory abnormalities that are part of the disease profile should not be reported as an SAE, specifically when they are allowed or not excluded by t he protocol inclusion/exclusion criteria.   
 When required, and according to local law and regulations, serious adverse events must be reported to the Ethics Committee and Regulatory Authorities.   
 All serious and unexpected adverse events should be report ed to MD Anderson IRB 
and Bayer  within [ADDRESS_372193] for reporting procedures.  
 
The Investigator  may report serious adverse drug reactions (SADRs) using 
either:  
 
An ADEERS form (Adverse Event Expedited Reporting System) available at 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/adeers.html   
 
OR

For this study, the applicable reference document is the most current version of the 
investigator’s brochure (IB) / summary of product characteristics.  
Overview listings of frequent events that have occurred so far in the clinical development are shown in the current IB.  If relevant new safety information is identified, the information will be integrated into an update of the IB and distributed 
to all participating sites.  
The expectedness of AEs will be determined by [CONTACT_304258].  
 
    
13 October 2014  Version : Final  Page:   37 of 46 
 
37 
 [IP_ADDRESS]  Adverse events of special safety interest:  
Since radium 223 dichloride is  eliminated in the feces, but is an  alpha emitter, 
feces containing the radiopharmaceutical can be safely disposed of by [CONTACT_304259]. If however there is ever an incident of placing the subjects excreta 
in the food of another person and the radiopharmaceutical  is ingested (e.g. an 
alpha particle emitting special sandwich) , this should be reported to the principal 
investigator [INVESTIGATOR_304241] (probably not) using gamma 
camera imaging to quantitate whether any significant bone absorption has 
occurred.  
Long -term growth monitoring  (<18 years only)  
Patients with growth potential (e.g. epi[INVESTIGATOR_304242] 
99mTcMDP scan) will have yearly growth monitored ( and compared to weight and 
height vs weight percentile) for age until age [ADDRESS_372195].  
 Any secondary m alignancies or potential long-term (i.e. > 2  months) grade 3 or 
greater hematologic toxicities  will also be reported to MD Anderson IRB and Bayer.  
 Survival data will be reported yearly as long as MD Anderson Cancer Center IRB continuing review and yearly  IND reporting is done.  Data concerning any expected 
unexpected or unusual bone toxicities (e.g. hardware failure, pathologic fracture of limb salvage bones) will be collected and reported annually.  
 
7.4.[ADDRESS_372196]’s participation in this study.  The report should be submitted within the same timelines as an SAE, although a pregnancy per se is not considered an SAE.   
For a study subject, the outcome of the pregnancy should be followed up carefully, 
and any abnormal outcome of the mother or the child should be reported.  
For the pregnancy of a study subject’s partner, all efforts should be made to obtain similar information on course and outcome, subject to the partner’s consent.  
For all reports, the forms provided are to be used.

 7.4.3  Further safety  
Progressive disease 
If progressive disease leads to signs and symptoms that meet the criteria for an SAE 
(i.e., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], disability, death, or important medical event), the signs and 
symptoms should be reported as an SAE and not the underlying progressive disease.  
Death  
If any subject dies during the trial or within [ADDRESS_372197] the cause of death 
in detail (using the SAE Form) within 1 working day . 
7.5 Other procedures and variables  
7.6 Appropriateness of procedures / measurements  
The assessments described in the previous sections are widely used and generally recognized as reliable, accurate, and relevant for determining the safety and efficacy 
of therapi[INVESTIGATOR_304243].  
8. Statistical methods and determination of sample size 
8.1 Analysis sets 
 
Safety monitoring rule  
• Should DLTs occur in more than two patients at any time during the dose 
expansion phase clinical personnel and study investigators will meet and assess the attribution, severity and nature of the DLTs. No additional patients will be accrued until the data is reviewed and a decision is made to continue at the current dose or to de- escalate the prior dose as the dose for the 
expansion phase. This review and decision will be documented in writing.  
 
 
Monitoring of alkaline phosphatase  
• Alkaline phosphatase, a biomarker associated with osteosarcoma metastases, wi ll be determined monthly before administration of each dose of 
Ra-223 dichloride.  The trend of improvement (or not) will be analyzed for a 
particular patient and number of patients in a cohort with improvement as a function of dose # will be analyzed.   
 
Imaging 
 
    
13 October 2014  Version : Final  Page:   39 of 46 
 
39 
 • Nuclear Medicine Studies  will use commercially available 99mTc, 
18Flurodeoxyglucose and sodium 18Fluoride to image indicator lesions.  The 
trend of improvement (or not) in 99mTc-MDP on SPECT CT, 18FDG -PET-CT 
SUV, or Na18F SUV will be compared for s tudy entry vs after dose #3 and 
study entry vs after dose #6 and after dose #3 vs after dose #6 will analyzed 
for a particular patient and number of patients in a cohort with improvement 
after dose #3 and dose #6 will be analyzed.    
• Analysis of lung metas tases. Up to 3 measurable (1 cm or larger) indicator 
lesions seen on chest CT may be described at study entry and compared after dose #3 and dose #6. RECIST criteria (>20% increase in size) will be used as criteria for progression. Any change <20% or if si ze is <1 cm will not 
be used for “off study” progression criteria.  
 
• RECIST progression will determine progressive disease regardless of other 
imaging.

 • If the study conduct (e.g. recruitment rate; drop- out rate; data quality; protocol 
compliance) does not suggest a proper completion of the tr ial within a 
reasonable time frame.  
The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_304244]/her center at any time.  
For any of the above closures, the following applies:  
• Closure s should occur only after consultation between involved parties.  
• All affected ins titutions (e.g. IEC(s)/IRB(s); competent authority(ies); study 
center; head of study center) must be informed as applicable according to 
local law.  
• In case of  a partial study closure, ongoing subjects, including those in post 
study follow -up, must be taken care of in an ethical manner.  
Details for individual subject's withdrawal can be found in Section 5.2.1 . 
11.  Ethical and legal aspects : IND  
11.1Ethical and legal conduct of the study  
The procedures set out in this pr otocol, pertaining to the conduct, evaluation, and 
documentation of this study, are designed to ensure that the investigator abide by [CONTACT_23663] (GCP) g uidelines and under the guiding principles detailed in 
the Declaration of Helsinki.  The study will also be carried out in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_39684](s) and regulation(s).  
Documented approval from appropriate IEC(s)/IRBs will be obtained for all participating centers before start of the study, according to GCP, local laws, regulations and organizations.  When necessary, an extension, amendment or renewal of the EC/IRB approval must be obtained and also forwarded to Bayer.  
Strict adherence to all specifications laid down in this protocol is required for all aspects of study conduct; the investigator may not modify or alter the procedures described in this protocol.   
Modifications to the study protocol will not be implemented by [CONTACT_304260] .  However, the investigator may 
implement a deviation fr om, or a change of, the protocol to eliminate an immediate 
hazard(s) to the trial subjects without prior IEC/IRB/ Bayer  approval/favorable 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649].  As soon as possible, the implemented deviation or change, the reasons for it and if appropriate the proposed protocol amendment should be submitted to the 
IEC/IRB/head of medical institution.  Any deviations from the protocol must be explained and documented by [CONTACT_093].

Declaration of Helsinki.  The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_39686].  The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_9979], including sub- investigators and other study staff 
members, adhere to the study protocol and all FDA/GCP/NCI regulations and guidelines regarding clinical trials both during and after study completion.  
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_39687].   
Since this is an investigator initiated IND study at MD Anderson, Bayer will provide a letter of to authorize the FDA to cross- reference of its current IND and well as 
agreement to supply Ra- [ADDRESS_372202] the PI  [INVESTIGATOR_304245]/submissions to the FDA also.  
11.2Subject information and consent 
Each subject / legal representative or proxy consenter will have ample time and opportunity to ask questions and will be informed about the right to withdraw from the study at any time without any disadvantage and without having to provide reasons for this decision.  Subjects <[ADDRESS_372203] / legal representative or proxy consenter voluntarily agrees to sign the informed consent form and has done so, may he/she enter the study.  Additionally, the investigator and other information provider (if any) will personally sign and date the form.  The subject / legal representative or proxy consenter will receive a copy of the signed and dated form.   
The signed informed consent statement is to remain in t he investigator site file or, if 
locally required, in the patient’s medical record 
In the event that informed consent is obtained on the date that baseline study 
procedures are performed, the study record or subject’s clinical record must clearly show that  informed consent was obtained prior to these procedures.  
 
1. If the patient is not capable of providing a signature, a verbal statement of consent can also be given in the presence of an impartial witness (independent of Bayer and the investigator).  This  is to be documented by a signature [CONTACT_304262] a signature [CONTACT_23686].  
2. For minors or adults under legal protection, consent shall be given by [CONTACT_23666](s).  The consent of a minor or adult under legal protection shall also be 
 
    
13 October 2014  Version : Final  Page:   43 of 46

 requested where such a person is able to express his/her own will.  His/her 
refusal or the withdrawal of his/her consent may not be disregarded.  
3. In emergency situations, when prior consent of the patient is not possible, the consent of the patient’s legal representative(s) or proxy consenter, if present, 
should be requested.  The patient should be informed about the study as soon as possible and his/her consent to continue the study should be requested.  
The informed consent form and any other written information provided to subjects / legal representatives or proxy consenters will be revised whenever important new information becomes available that may be relevant to the subject’s consent, or there is an amendment to the protocol that necessitates a change to the content of the subject information and / or the written informed consent form.  The investigator will inform the subject / legal representative or proxy consenter of changes in a timely manner and will ask the subject to confir m his/her participation in the study by 
[CONTACT_23667].  Any revised written informed consent form and written information must receive the IEC/IRB`s approval / favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_19349].  
11.3Publication policy  
Bayer recognizes the right of the investigator to publish results upon completion of the study.  However, the investigator must send a draft manuscript of the publication or abstract to Bayer at least thirty days in advance of submission in order to obtain approval pr ior to submission of the final version for publication or congress 
presentation.  This will be reviewed promptly and approval will not be withheld unreasonably.  In case of a difference of opi[INVESTIGATOR_39688](s), the contents of the publication will be discussed in order to find a solution which satisfies both parties. All relevant aspects regarding data reporting and publication will be part of the contract between Bayer and the investigator/institution

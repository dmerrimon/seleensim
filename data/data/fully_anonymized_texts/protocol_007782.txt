CONF IDENTIA LStudy Design: This is a phase 2, multicenter, ra ndom ized, open -label study to estimate the 
efficacy  of talimogene laherparepvec as a neoadjuvant treatment followed by [CONTACT_702268] y alone in subjects with completely resectable stage IIIB, IIIC, or IVM1a melanoma.  
Approximately 150 subjects will be randomized 1:1 to receive the following:
Arm 1:   Talimogene laherparepvec for 6 doses followed by [CONTACT_702269](s) .
Talimogene Laherparepvec:
Talimogene laherparepvec will be administered by [CONTACT_702270], subcutaneous, and nodal tumors initially at a dose of 106 plaque 
forming units (P FU)/mL at day 1 of week 1 followed by a dose of 108 PFU/mL at day 1 
(±3days) of week 4, 6, 8, [ADDRESS_953254].  Due to the mechanism of action of 
talimogene laherparepvec , subjects may  experience transient growth in existing tumors 
or the appearance of new tumors prior to maximal clinical benefit of talimogene 
laherparepvec .  Subjects who experience growth in existing tumors or the appearance of 
new tumors will be allowed to remain on talimogene lah erparepvec treatment until 
week 12 of therapy unless, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], immediate sur gical resection 
or any other treatment for melanoma is warranted .  If talimogene laherparepvec 
treatment will end p rior to week 12, the investigator or designee should notify the 
sponsor’s medical monitor as soon as possible.
Surgical Resection of Melanoma Tumor Lesions(s):
For subjects who complete 12 weeks of talimogene laherparepvec treatment, surgical 
resection of melanoma lesion(s) will be performed at any time during weeks 13 to 18.  
Refer to Appendix Ffor surgery guidelines. Subjects who stop talimogene laherparepvec 
prior to week 12 due to disappearance of all injectable tumor lesions, intolerance to 
talimogene laherparepvec ,or any other reason will undergo surgical resection of 
melanom a lesion(s) or tiss ues where melanoma was present before achieving complete 
response ( CR)within [ADDRESS_953255] dose of talimogene laherparepvec.  If 
surgery will be performed prior to week 12, the investigator or designee should notify  the 
sponsor’s medical mon itor as soon as possible.
Arm 2:   Immediate surgical resection of melanoma tumor lesion(s) 
Surgical resection of melanoma tumor lesion(s) will be performed after randomization any
time during weeks 1 to 6.  Refer to Appendix Ffor surgery guidelines.
Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_123573] (IIIB nodal versus IIIB in -transit versus IIIC 
nodal versus IIIC in -transit with nodal versus IVM1a) ,planned adjuvant therapy (adjuvant 
systemic therapy [eg, interfero nalpha (INFα ), ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] ] with or without radiotherapy versus
radiotherapy without adjuvant systemic therapy versus none).
Following surgery, adjuvant sy stemic therapy and/or radiotherapy may be administered at the 
investigator ’sdiscretion and per the i nstitutional standard of care.
Subjects will be followed for safety  approximately 30 (+ 15) day s after surgery and for disease 
recurrence (local, regional ,or distant) , subsequent anticancer therapy for melanoma , adverse 
events thought to be potentially rel ated to talimogene laherparepvec (Arm 1 only) ,and survival 
every3 months (±30days) for first 3 years after the end of the safety  follow -upperiod and then 
every6 months (±30days)until death, subject withdraws full consent, or up to [ADDRESS_953256] a 
single dose of talimogene laherparepvec will be followed under an ongoing separate registry 
protocol (Study 20120139) for the long -term survival follow -up of subj ects treated with talimogene 
laherparepvec.  The registry protocol will also monitor for late and long -term adverse events 
thought to be potentially related to talimogene laherparepvec and use of subsequent anticancer 
therapy for melanoma .Subjects who after the long -term follow -up period of this study

ongoing separate registry protocol (Study 20120139) that is in place for the long -term follow -up of 
all subjects treated with talimogene laherparepvec in clinical trials.  The registry protocol will also 
monitor for late and long -term adverse events thought to be potentially related to talimogene 
laherparepvec and use of subsequent anticancer therapy for m elanom a.  Subjects who after the

memb er, caregiver, or healthcare provider as specified in Section 9.4.
For a full list of study procedures, including the timing of each procedure, please 
refer to Section 7and the Schedule of Assessments (Table 2and Table 3).
Statistical Considerations:
The primary  analysis for the primary  endpoint will occur at the later time of either the occurrence 
of approximately 64 events (local , regional ,or distant recurrence of melanoma or death) or 
approximately 2 years after the end of randomization.   An 80% confidence interval ( CI)will be

Protocol Number:  20110266
Date:  [ADDRESS_953266] ratio (HR) and the between -arm difference ( Arm2 – Arm1) in 
2-year RFS , ie,2-year RFS .  It is assumed that: (i) RFS is exponential over the first 2 years, 
(ii) the 2 -year RFS for Arm1 is about 0.60 ( Eggermont et al, 2008 ), and that there will be a 
10% exponential probability of drop -out by [CONTACT_702273] . The average width of the 
2-year RFS 80% CI was 0.20 based on the simulation with an approximately 150 subjects 
randomized 1:1 to the two arms.  
Two interim analyses with no formal stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_702231] (eg, R0 resection rate, pCR rate, response to neoadjuvant treatment) when 
approximately [ADDRESS_953267] had the 
opportunity to complete the safety follow -up visit . The primary  analysis for certain seconda ry 
endpoints (eg,response to neoadjuvant treatment, R0 resection rate, pCR rate, and safety ) will 
be performed using the data from the second interim analysis.
An additional third interim analysis with no formal stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_702232] 1 year after the end of randomization.  This analysis will be conducted 
by [CONTACT_246516].
The primary  analyses for RFS will occur at the later time of either the occurrence of 
approximately 64 events ( local, regional ,or distant recurren ce of me lanom a or death ) or 
approximately 2 years after end of randomization.
The final analyses will occur approximately 5 years after the end of randomization . An additional 
analysis will also occur approximately 3 years after the end of randomization .
Ad hoc analyses for safety or some efficacy  endpoints (eg,response to neoadjuvant treatment, 
R0 resection rate, pCR rate) may be conducted before the planned primary and/or final analy ses
if interim data arerequired for submission to regulator y authoriti es.
All efficacy  analy ses will be descriptive with no formal hypothesis testing. Kaplan -Meier (KM)
estimates and CI will be calculated for RFS, LRFS, RRFS, DMFS, OS landmarks ( 1-, 2-, 3-and 
5-year rates) and quartiles.  Estimates and CIs for between -group differences will also be 
calculated.  An overall between -group difference in RFS, LRFS, RRFS, DMFS, and OS will be 
evaluated with a log -rank test and corresponding proportional hazards model with or without two 
randomization stratification factors. Estimates and exact CIs for binar y endpoints (eg, overall 
tumor response, response in injected and uninjected lesions, R0 rate, pCR) and their associated 
between -group differences will be calculated .
Subject incidence rates of treatment- emergent adverse events (including all adverse events, 
grade ≥ [ADDRESS_953268] and events requiring the discontinuation of study drug, local effects on the tumor [ie, pain, 
inflammation and ulceration]) will be summarized.
Theanalyses of tumor tissue or serum biomarkers may be performed after collection of all 
samples during the conduct of the study and therefore may be reported after the primary analysis 
of efficacy  endpoint.

CONFIDENTIA Lthe annual incidence of melanoma is somewhat lower than that in the [LOCATION_003], with a crude 
rate of approximately 14 per 100,000 as compared to 20 per 100,000 in the [LOCATION_003] 
(Ferlay et al, 201 3).  In Europe as a whole, 100, 442 new cases of skin melanoma and 
22, 212 deaths from melanoma were estimated in 2012 ( Ferlay et al, 201 3).  The 
incidence of melanoma in Australia is the hig hest in the world, with the age -standardized 
incidence rate of approximately 50 per 100,000 people in 2009 ( Australian Institute of 
Health and Welfare, 2012 ).  The incidence of melanoma is increasing rapi[INVESTIGATOR_702233], 
with a 270% increase in the [LOCATION_003] between [ADDRESS_953285] 
rapid of any cancer with the exception o f thyroid cancer in women ( Edwards et al, 2005 ; 
Siegel et al, 2014).  Median age for diagnosis of melanoma (59 years) is significantly 
lower than the median age of diagnosis for the more common solid tumors.  As such, 
melanoma is second only to adult leuke mia in terms of loss of years of potential life per 
adult cancer -related death ( Coit et al, 2013 ).
When discovered in earlier stages and fully excised, melanoma is highly curable with 
10-year overall survival (OS) approaching 95% for stage I and 45- 77% for stageII 
(American Joint Committee on Cancer [AJCC], 7thedition) melanoma ( Balch et al, 2009 ).  
It is estimated that about 10% of subjects with m elanoma present with 
regionally -advanced disease (stage III) and approximatel y 30% will have nodal and/or 
in-transit metastasis as their first site of recurrence ( Kirkwood et al, 2000; SEER, 201 4).  
While radical resection is a cornerstone of treatment for subjects with stage III 
melanoma (Slingluff et al, 2011; Coit et al, 2013 ), the majority of subjects with cl inically 
detectable nodal metastases and/or in -transit disease wil l experience recurrence, with 
5-year OSof 59% for subjects with stage IIIB disease and 40% for IIIC disease 
(Balch etal, 2009 ).  In one of the latest adjuvant trials utilizing pegylated interferon alpha
(IFNα)- 2b, 4 -year RFS and OS of all subjects with palpable nodal disease 
(N2-N3, AJCC, 7thedition) in the observation gr oup were 33.9 ± 2.6% and 46.8 ± 2.6% 
respectively, droppi[INVESTIGATOR_702234] 
(Eggermont etal, 2008 ).
Approximately 20% of subjects with earlier stages of melanoma will develop distant 
cutaneous/subcutaneous or distant nodal metastasis in the absence of visceral disease 
or elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (stage IVM1a) ( Kirkwood et al, 2000).  Stage 
IVM1a melanoma has better prognosis compared with metastases located in any other 
distant anatomic site, with 1 -year OS of 62%, and 5 -year OS approaching 30%

CONFIDENTIA L(Balch etal, 2009 ).  Resection, if feasible, is often recommended for this group of 
subjects ( Sling luff et al, 2011; Coit et al, 2013 ).
High-dose (HD) IFNα ( Intron®A, 2013) or pegylated IFNα ( Sylatron , 2013 ) are the 
FDA-approved systemic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_702235].  Other treatment options recomm ende d by [CONTACT_337579] (NCCN) and European Society for Medical Oncology 
(ESMO) Guidelines include participation in clinical trials, or observation 
(Dummer etal,2012 ; Coit et al, 2013).  Even with a higher rate of relapse than stageIII 
disease, there is littleevidence to support adjuvant treatment with IFN α for resected 
IVM1a melanoma.
HD IFNα has shown a modest, but significant RFS benefit when given as adjuvant 
therapy to subjects with melanomas at high risk for recurrence ( Kirkwood et al, 2000 ; 
Kirkwood et al, 1996 ).  A pooled analysis of three major adj uvant trials with HD IFNα 
found an improvement in RFS in subjects with melanomas that are 4 mm or thicker with 
no evidence of lymph node involvement, or stage III melanomas with either lymph node 
involvement and/or in -transit metastases (hazard ratio [HR] 0.77, two -sided p < 0.006, 
median follow -up of 7.2 years), but failed to demonstrate a significant improvement in 
OS (HR 0.93, two- sided p = 0.42) ( Kirkwood et al, 2004).  Major toxicities of HD IFNα 
include flu- like symptoms, auto -immune disorders, hepato toxicity, significant laboratory 
abnormalities, depression, and suicide (Slingluff et al, 2011).  As such, adjuvant HD 
IFNα after resection of stage III melanoma is decreasingly being utilized 
(Coitetal,2013 ) and is not recommended as a standard of care for adjuvant therapy 
according to the guidelines of several professional societies ( Marsden et al, 2010 ; 
Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network, 2013 ).
Intermediate -dose regimens of pegylated IFNα, which are more convenient to 
administer and have bee n evaluated in several clinical trials , demonstrated improved 
RFS (HR 0.82, p = 0.011, 95% confidence interval [ CI]: 0.71; 0.96), however there 
wasno effect on DMFS or OS, and toxicity was signific ant with grade 3 adverse 
events in approximately 40% of s ubjects; leading to discontinuation of therapy in 
about one -third of subjects assigned to the treatment arm (Eggermont et al, 2008 ;
Eggermont etal,2005 ).
A recently reported intergroup phase III trial compared a HD IFN α regimen to a 9 -week 
“biochemotherapy” consisting of dacarbazine, vinblastine, cisplatin, intravenous 
interleukin (IL) -2, and subcutaneous IFNα as adjuvant treatment for patients after

CONFIDENTIA Lresection of high -risk stage III melanoma. At a median follow -up of 6 years, 
biochemotherapy improved RFS (HR 0.77, p < 0.02; 90% CI: 0.62-0.96), however there 
was no difference in OS (HR 1.0, p = 0.49, 90% CI: 0.78-1.27) and same 56% of 
subjects were alive at 5 years in both arms of the trial. The biochemotherapy regime n 
was associated with substantial toxicity with grade 3 and 4 adverse events in 36% and 
40% of subjects, respectively ( Flaherty et al, 2012 ).
Several meta -analyses have confirmed a significant effect of adjuvant IFN α on RFS 
andsome demonstrated small but significant improvement in OS ( Wheatley et al, 2007 ; 
Wheatley et al, 2003; Mocellin et al, 2013; Mocel lin et al, 2010 ). In the latest Cochrane 
meta -analysis that included aggregate patient data from 17 randomized c linical trials 
comparing adjuvant IFNα to observation, adjuvant IFNα was associated with improved 
disease- free survival (HR 0.83, p<0.[ZIP_CODE], 95% CI: 0.78-0.87) and improved OS 
(HR0.91, p<0.003, 95% CI :  0.85-0.97) ( Mocel lin et al, 2013). The authors 
concluded that [ADDRESS_953286] death

A variety of whole -cell based and defined antigen -based melanoma vaccines were 
explored in the adjuvant setting. However, the results of the trials either showed no 
benefit or could possibly be detrimental compared with observation 
(Eggermont etal,2008; Blanchard et al, 2013 ).

(37% immune -related), and 8% grade 4 (6% immune -related) (Eggermont et al, 2015 ).
Neoadjuvant therapy, the benefit of which has been demonstrated in several operable 
cancers ( Bosset et al, 2006 ;  Rastogi et al, 2008 ; Vergote et al, 2010 ), has potential 
advantages over adjuvant therapy in subjects with locally -advanced disease which 
include down -sizing of the primary tumor, consequently increasing the probability of 
negative margin resection, and early systemic exposure to potentially effective therapy 
through intact blood and lymphatic vessels.  Moreover, neoadjuvant therapy allows 
real-time assessment of antineoplastic effects of the therapy in vivo on tumor cells, 
tumor mic roenvironment and the immune system, and permits prospective and 
sequential collection of tissue samples for biomarker studies.
This investigational approach for preoperative treatment of subj ects with 
locally -advanced melanoma was utilized in several phas e2 trials where the subjects 
were treated by [CONTACT_702275] -dose IFNα ( Moschos et al, 2006) or by 
[CONTACT_702276] ( Buzaid et al, 1998 ; Koy anagi et al, 2005; Lewis et al, 2006 ).  
Ninety -two subjects with histologically -proven stage III nodal melanoma were enrolled in 
the phase 2 study to receive 2 cycles of preoperative biochemotherapy followed by 
[CONTACT_203839] 2postoperative cycles of biochemotherapy ( Lewis et al, 2006).  Treatment, 
which included cisplatin, dacarbazine, vinblastine, and IL -2 and IFNα, was administered 
in the inpatient setting and included growth factors and blood pressure support.  
Common adverse events were hematological grade 3 and 4 toxicities ,electrolytes 
grade 3 toxicities ,and nausea and vomiting . Nearly 40% of subjects required do se 
reductions and 40% had treatment delays.  Among fifty subjects with measurable 
disease, complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) rates were 4% and 22%, 
respectively (assessed by W orld Health Organization [ WHO]criteria [ WHO handbook for 
reporting results of cancer treatment, 1979]).  Half of the subjects (50%) had stable 
disease (SD) and 8% had tumor progression.  At the time of surgery, 26% of  subjects 
with measurable disease had pCR.  In another neoadjuvant trial, 20 subjects with 
palpable regi onal lymph node metastatic melanoma we re treated by [CONTACT_702277]-dose IFN for 4 weeks followed by [CONTACT_702278] 
48weeks ( Moschos et al, 2006 ).  CR was noted in 1 (5%) subject and 10 subjects (50%) 
had PR.  At the time of surgery, 15% of subjects had pCR.  Immunohistoche mical

2.2 Talimogene Laherparepvec Background
Talimogene laherparepvec is an intralesionally -delivered oncolytic immunotherapy 
comprised of a genetically engineered herpes simplex virus type 1 ( HSV-1) that 
selectively replicates in tumor s (Talimogene Laherparepvec Investigator’s 
Broch ure,2015 ).  The neurovirulence factor ICP34.5 and the ICP47 -encoding gene are 
functionally deleted in the virus, while the gene for human granulocyte macrophage 
colony -stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is inserted. The ICP34.5 functional deletion allows 
the virus to replicate selectively in tumors.  The role of ICP47 is to block antigen 
presentation to major histocompatibility complex class I and II molecules by [CONTACT_702279] 1 and 2. This deletion also allows the 
increas ed expression of the US11 gene.  This promotes virus growth in cancer cells 
without decreasing tumor selectivity.
Additionally, the virus contains the coding sequence for human GM -CSF, a pleiotropic 
cytokine involved in the stimulation of cellular immune r esponses by [CONTACT_44856] ( Demir et al, 2003 ; Lonial, 2004 ; 
Conti and Gessani, 2008 ).  Dendritic cells have the capaci ty to capture antigens, 
migrate in response to chemotactic stimuli, and induce prolifer ative responses and 
Th1cytokine production in CD4+ and CD8+ T -lymphocytes ( Hart, 1997 ; Steinman, 2001 ; 
Ikeda et al, 2004 ; Paul, 2007 ).  Th1 -type cytokines have the capacity to produce 
proinflammatory responses, eradicate tumors, and perpetuate autoimmune responses 
(Nishimura et al, 2000; Ikeda et al, 2004 ; Knutson and Disis, 2005 ).
The postulated dual mechanism of action of talimogene laherparepvec comprises : 
1)adirect oncolytic effect achieved by [CONTACT_702280] r esulting in tumor cell lysis and local release of tumor antigens, and 
2)enhancement of a systemic immune response by [CONTACT_702281] -CSF i n the tumor 
microenvironment to recruit and activate antigen presenting cells.  Clinical data currently 
available have provided evidence of talimogene laherparepvec’s efficacy in subject s with

Brochure ,2015 ).  In particular, a high rate of CR was achieved (16% )in the 
phase 2study with talimogen e laherparepvec in stage lllC to IV melanoma 
(Senzer etal,2009 ; Talimogene Laherparepvec Investigator’s Brochure 2015 ). 
Moreover , responses were observed in both injected and uninjected sites, including 
visceral sites.  Responses were seen most often in earlier stage disease, including 
stage lllB/C and stage IVM1a, and in disease with lower visceral burden.
In the open -label, randomized, phase [ADDRESS_953289] until week 24, or CR, clinically significant disease

response, or withdrawal of consent (Study 20110263; OPTiM).  If sub jects were in 
response (CR or PR) at 12 months, they wer e treated in both arms up to 18 months or 
disease progression (PD), whichever was earlier. The primary endpoint of the OPTiM 
study wasdurable response rate (DRR) , defined as the rate of subjects wit h an objective 
response (CR or PR) by [CONTACT_702282] [ADDRESS_953290] 
response, modified PFS , tumor burden and safety.
Primary analysis of the OPTiM Study showed a statistically significant difference 
between the DRR among subjects treated with talimogene laherparepvec 
(16% ; 95% CI:  12%, 21%) versus those treated with GM -CSF (2%; 95% CI :  0%, 5%) 
(p-value <0.0001) ( Andtbacka et al, 2013 ).At the same analysis median modified PFS 
was 8.2 (95% CI, 6.5 ,9.9) months in the talimogene laherparepvec arm versus 
2.9(95% CI, 2.8, 4.0) months in the GM -CSF arm (HR=0.42; 95%CI=0.32 , 0.54). An 
improvement that closely approached statistical significance was seen in the 
intent -to-treat population in the primary analysis of the secondary endpoint of OS with 
HR of 0.79 (95% CI: 0.62, 1.00) ,p = 0.051 . Median OS of subjects treated with 
talimogene laherparepvec was 4.4 months longer than those treated with GM -CSF 
(23.3. months for talimogene laherparepvec versus 18.9 months for GM -CSF) 
(Kaufman et al, 2014). Survival at 12, 24, 36 and 48 months in the talimogene 
laherparepvec arm was estimated to be 74%, 50%, 39% and 33%, respectively, and 
69%, 40%, 3 0% and 21% in the GM -CSF arm, respectively. In exploratory subset 
analyses, the treatment effect was most pronounced among subjects receiving treatment 
as first -line therapy (HR=0.50; 95% CI=0.35 , 0.73) compared with subjects receiving

of talimogene laherparepvec objective responders and 48% of talimogene laherparepvec 
durable responders exhibited “interval progression”, which is transient locoregional or

2.3 Rationale
The main purpose of the study is to estimate the ability of talimo gene laherparepvec 
administered prior to surgery to increase RFS in subjects with resectable stage IIIB to 
IVM1a melanoma.
It is expected that neoadjuvant treatment with talimogene laherparepvec will improve 
both local and distant control by [CONTACT_702284] -free ( negative )margin 
surgical resection (R0), and will decrease distant metastasis rate through systemic 
effects on micrometastatic disease.
Since talimogene laherparepvec is assumed to work via activation of the immune system
and infiltrating T cells have also been shown to be prognostic for melanoma 
(Erdag etal,2012 ), it is important to understand whether the number and type of tumor 
infiltrating and peripheral immune cells impact drug efficacy. Therefore , tumor and blood 
samples wi ll be collected before and at the end of the talimogene laherparepvec 
treatment to investigate the relationship between the activities of the immune system, 
such as cytotoxic CD3+/CD8+ and CD8+/CD45R0 T -lymphocytes, tumor antigen 
specific T cells, regulato
ry T cells and myeloid- derived suppressor cells measured both 
in the tumor and /orin the peripheral blood, and response to the treatment.  Additionally, 
a number of immune -related biomarkers, such as antibodies to melanoma antigens and
expression of immune- stimulatory and immune -inhibitory molecules (eg CTLA-4,

CONFIDENTIA Lprogram cell death -1 [PD-1], program cell death- 1 ligand 1 [PD -L1] and others) in tumors 
or tumor infiltrating T -cells will be assessed to determine any association with clinical 
outcomes .
Moreover, tumor biopsy samples will be assessed for mutations effecting viral 
replication, such as double- stranded RNA -activated protein kinase (PKR)that cells 
activate to protect themselves from viral infection andwhose activity may predict clinical 
response to treatment with talimogene laherparepvec.  Also, safety of talimogene 
laherparepvec, especially related to postoperative complications will be evaluated.

treatment will end prior to week 12, the investigator or designee should notify the 
sponsor’s medical monitor as soon as possible.
Surgical Resection of Melanoma Tumor Lesions(s) :
For subjects who complete 12 weeks of talimogene laherparepvec treatment, 
surgical resection of melanoma lesion(s) will be performed at any time dur ing 
weeks 13 to 18.Subjects who stop talimog ene laherparepvec prior to week 12

Arm 2: Immediate surgical resection of melanoma tumor lesion(s) 
Surgical resection of melanoma tumor lesion(s) will be performed after enrolment
anytime during weeks 1 to 6. Refer to
 Appendix Ffor surgery guidelines.
Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_123573] (IIIB nodal versus IIIB in- transit versus
IIIC nodal versus IIIC in- transit withnodal versus IVM1a ),planned adjuvant therapy 
(adjuvant systemic therapy [ eg,INFα , ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] ]with or without radiotherapy versus
radiotherapy without adjuvant systemic therapy versus none ).
Following surgery, adjuvant systemic therapy and/or radiotherapy may be administered 
at the investigator ’sdiscretion and per the institutional standard of care.
Subjects will be followed for safety approximately 30 (+ 15) days after surgery and for 
disease recurrence (local, regional ,ordistant ), subsequent anticancer therapy for

Talimogene laherparepvec will be manufactured and packaged by [CONTACT_702290] n clinical study drug distribution procedures.   Talimogene 
laherparepvec is supplied as a sterile frozen liquid in a single -use 2 -cc Crystal Zenith 
(CZ resin) vial with a gray Fluorotec®-coated chlorobutyl elastomer stopper, aluminum 
seal, and polypropylene cap.  Each vial contains a minimum of 1.0 mL talimogene 
laherparepvec at either 106PFU/mL or 108PFU/mL concentrations .  The supply for the 
106PFU/mL concentration will be packaged separately from the supply for the 
108PFU/mL concentration.
[IP_ADDRESS] Dosage, A dministration, and Schedule
Talimogene laherparepvec must be prepared and administered by a qualified healthcare 
professional.  Subjects should be assessed clinically for adverse events/toxicity prior to 
each dose using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) 
version 3.0 (Appendix A).  Complete blood count with differential and chemistry panels 
including liver function laboratory tests (ALT, AST, and total bilirubin) should be obtained 
according t o the Schedule of Assessments (see Table 2)and the results should be 
checked before the administration of talimogene laherparepvec according to Schedule of 
Assessments .  Dosing will occur only if these test values are acceptable, per

106PFU/mL.  Subsequent doses of talimog ene laherparepvec are up to 4.0 mL of 
108PFU/mL.
The first cycle of talimogene laherparepvec will be 21 (+5) days.  Subsequent cycles of 
talimogene laherparepvec will be 14 ( ±3) days.  On day [ADDRESS_953328] dose of 
talimogene laherparepvec will be up to 4.0 mL of 106PFU/mL.  The second injection up 
to 4.0mL of 108 PFU/mL, should be administered 21 (+5) days after the initial injection 
(ie, no sooner than day 22 but should not be delaye d more than 5 days after the 21 -day 
time point).  Subsequent injections up to 4.0 mL of 108 PFU/mL should be given every 
14(±3) days until week 12, all injectable tumors have disappeared, or intolerance of 
study treatment, whichever occurs first.
The maximum volume of talimogene laherparepvec administered at any dose is 4.[ADDRESS_953329] cannot tolerate the full dose due to an 
injection -related adverse event such as pain, the total volume given should be recorded, 
and the reason for intolerance should be documented as an adverse event.
The recommended volume of talimogene laherparepvec to be injected into the tumor(s) 
is dependent on the size of the tumor(s) and should be determined according to the 
injection volume guideline in Table 1 .  The tumor size assessment for the injection 
should be done by [CONTACT_702291] a ruler or caliper for cutaneous lesions and 
palpable and protruding subcutaneous and nodal lesions, or by [CONTACT_702292] -seated subcutaneous and nodal lesions.

CONFIDENTIA LAll reasonably injectable lesions (cutaneous , subcutaneous, and nodal disease that can 
be injected with or without ultrasound guidance) should be injected with the maximum 
dosing volume available on an individual dosing occasion ( Table 1 ).  On each treatment
day, prioritization of injections is recommended as follows:
any new injectable tumor that has appeared since the last injection
by [CONTACT_44871], beginning with the largest tumor 
any previously uninjectable tumor(s) that is now injectable
It is recommended that each lesion should receive the maximum amount possible to 
inject due to tumor properties at each visit before moving on to the next lesion, using the 
prioritization model above and the injection volume guideline based on tumor size per 
Table 1 . Lesions should be injected until the maximum volume per day (4.0 mL) has 
been reached or there are no further injectable lesions, whichever comes first.
A subject will be treated with talimogene laherparepvec until week 12, all injectable 
tumors have disappeared, or intolerance of study treatment, whichever occurs first.  Due 
to the mechanism of action, subjects may experience transient growth in existing tumors 
or the appearance of new tumors prior to maximal clinical benefit of talimogene 
laherparepvec.  Therefore, subjects will be allowed to remain on talimogene 
laherparepvec treatment until week 12 of therapy unless, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_1070], immediate surgical resection or any other treatment for melanoma is 
warranted.   If talimogene laherparepvec t reatment will end prior to week 12, the

7.3.1 Blood Samples
Blood samples are to be collected for biomarker development at time points designated 
in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 2 andTable 3) and as described in
Section 7.2.2 .
Blood samples (both cells and plasma) will be analyzed for changes in the immune 
system before and during treatment that correlate with cl inical response.  Tumor 
antigen -specific cytotoxic T cells will be enumerated in blood samples by [CONTACT_702298] T cells thatbind or secrete cytokines in response to tumor antigen specific 
peptides such as the enzyme -linked immunosor bent spot ( ELISPOT )or tetramer assay.  
Changes in circulating immune cells will be characterized by [CONTACT_702299] T cells, B cells and NK cel ls.  
Tcell subsets will also be characterized for activat ion markers such as HLA -DR and 
CD25.  Additional assays which may be performed on blood samples include measuring 
antibody responses to melanoma antigens, changes in circulating cytokine levels before 
and during treatment, and RNA transcript profiling of c irculating blood cells.
Refer to the Laboratory Manual for detailed collection and handling procedures for blood 
samples for biomarker development.
7.3.2 Tumor Tissue Samples
Archived Tumor Tissue Sample:
A block of formalin- fixed paraffin -embedded tumor tissue collected prior to the study is to 
be sent to the central laboratory along with the corresponding pathology report as 
described in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 2 andTable 3 ) and in Section 7.2.[ADDRESS_953365] recent block should be submitted.  In lieu of a block, approximately 
20unstained sections on charged slides from the same block can be submitted.

On-study biopsies will be collected, as described in the Schedule of Assessments 
(Table 2and Table 3 ) and in Section 7.2.2 , to characterize the mechanism of systemic
action of talimogene laherparepvec.  Refer to the Laboratory Manual for specific 
instructions on tumor biopsy procedures.
Immunohistochemistry at a central laboratory will be used to measure the number of 
infiltrating CD8+ T cells in tumor biopsy samples collected before and after treatment as 
well as in archival tumor samples. Tissue slides will be stained for CD8+ cells and 
scanned to create a digital image. Image analysis software will be used to exclude 
areas of adjacent normal tissue, necrotic tissu e and large blood vessels and to define 
the region of interested which will be measured in square millimeters (mm2). Within the 
region of interest, the image analysis software will measure the number of CD8+ T cells 
and report the number of CD8+ T cells p er square millimeter (#CD8+ cells/mm2).   In 
addition to CD8 +cells, a variety of other tumor infiltrating immune cell markers may be 
explored by [CONTACT_702300]-4, FoxP3, PD-1, PD -L1, IDO, 
granzyme, and others.  The tumor samples will als o be analyzed for mutations or other 
changes within the PKR pathway , that could make tumor cells more susceptible to

documented and maintained, but are not necessarily reported as part of this study.  
Samples can be retained for up to [ADDRESS_953368]’s medical record and are not to be made available to the 
subject, members of the family, the personal physician, or other third parties, except as 
specified in the informed consent.
The subject retains the right to request that the sample material be destroyed by 
[CONTACT_701553] e investigator.  Following the request from the subject, the investigator is to 
provide the sponsor with the required study and subject number so that any remaining 
blood or tumor samples and any other components from the cells can be located and 
destroyed.  Samples will be destroyed once all protocol -defined procedures are 
completed.  However, information collected from samples prior to the request for 
destruction, will be retained by [CONTACT_11337].
The sponsor is the exclusive owner of any data, discoveries, or d erivative materials from 
the sample materials and is responsible for the destruction of the sample(s) at the 
request of the subject through the investigator, at the end of the storage period, or as 
appropriate (eg, the scientific rationale for experimentat ion with a certain sample type no

9.[ADDRESS_953372]’s medical record.
The definition of adverse events includes worsening of a pre- existing medical condition.  
Worsening indicates that the pre -existing medical condition (eg, diabetes, migraine 
headaches, gout) has increased in severity, frequency, and/or duration, and/or has an 
association wi th a significantly worse outcome.  A pre -existing condition that has not 
worsened during the study or involves an intervention such as elective cosmetic surgery 
or a medical procedure while on study ,is not considered an adverse event.

Date:  [ADDRESS_953373] a single event for each increased level of severity on the Adverse 
Event Summary CRF.  The investigator is expected to follow reported adverse events 
until stabilization or reversibility.
For situations when an adverse event or serious adverse event is due to melanoma ,
report all known signs and symptoms.   Death due to disease progression in the absence 
of signs and symptoms should be reported as the primary tumor type (eg, met astatic 
pancreatic cancer).
Note:   The term “disease progression” should not be used to describe the adverse 
event.  
The investigator’s clinical judgment is used to determine whether a subject is to be 
removed from treatment due to an adverse event.  In the event a subject, or subject’s 
legally acceptable representative request sto withdraw from protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_702251] ,refer to Section 8.1for additional instructions o n 
the procedures recommended for safe withdrawal from protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_83310].

life threatening (places the subject at immediate risk of death)
requires in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]
results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity
congenital anomaly/birth defect
other medically important serious event
An adverse event would meet the criterion of “requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]”, if the event 
necessitated an admission to a health care facility (eg, overnight stay).
If an i nvestigator considers an event to be clinically important, but it does not meet any 
of the serious criteria, the event could be classified as a serious adverse event under the 
criterion of “other medically important serious event”.  Examples of such events could 
include allergic bronchospasm, convulsions, blood dyscrasias, or ev ents that necessitate 
an emergency room visit, outpatient surgery, or urgent intervention.

follow -up visit (ie, 30 [+ 15] days after surgery) are reported using the applicable CRF
(eg, Adverse Event Summary).
The investigator must assign the following adverse event a ttributes:
Adverse event diagnosis or syndrome(s), if known (if not known, signs or symptoms),
Dates of onset and resolution (if resolved) ,
Severity [and/or toxicity per protocol],
Assessment of relatedness to talimogene laherparepvec or surgery , and
Actio n taken.
The adverse event grading scale used will be the CTCAE version 3.0.   The grading 
scale used in this study is described in Appendix A.  The investigator must assess 
whether the adverse event is possibly related to talimogene laherparepvec or surgery .  
This relationship is indicated by a “yes” or “no” response to the question:  Is there a 
reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by [CONTACT_702301] ?

The investigator is responsible for reviewing laboratory test results and determining 
whether an abnormal value in an individual study subject represents a clinically 
significant change from the subject’s baseline values.  In general, abnormal laboratory 
findings without clinical significance (based on the investigator's judgment) are not to be 
recorded as adverse events.  However, laboratory value changes that require treatment 
or adjus tment in current therapy are considered adverse events.  W here applicable,

the skin graft if that was used for closure
Regional recurrence -free survival (RRFS) :Time from randomization to the date of 
the first of regional disease recurrence or death due to any cause.  Regional 
recurrence excludes local recurrence and is defined as histologically, cytologically ,or 
radiographically confirmed reappearance of melanoma in the regional lymph node 
basin. New in -transit melanoma metastases in the regional lymphatic drainage will 
be reported as regional recurrence.  Histological or cytological confirmation of new 
in-transit metastases is recommended but is not required.

the opportunity to complete the safety follow -up visit .A Data Review Team (DRT) 
independent of the talimogene laherparepvec product team will review the first interim 
analysis (seeSection 10.4.2 ).  The DRT will also review some efficacy endpoints 
(eg, R0 resection rate, pCR rate, response to neoadj uvant treatment).
Thetalimogene laherparepvec product team will review the second interim analysis 
because it will occur after all subjects have been already treated ,have completed safety 
follow -up
, and no additional interventions that may influence safe ty or efficacy of the 
investigational product are planned after this time point .  The talimogene laherparepvec 
product team will also review some efficacy endpoints (eg, R0 resection rate, pCR rate, 
response to neoadjuvant treatment).

Ad hoc analyses for safety or some efficacy endpoints (eg,response to ne oadjuvant 
treatment, R0 resection rate, pCR rate) may be conducted before the planned primary 
and/or final analyses if interim data arerequired for submission to regulatory authorities.
These ad hoc analyses will be executed by [CONTACT_702306].
10.4.2 Data Review Team (DRT)
The DRT will consist of one [COMPANY_010] biostatistician and two[COMPANY_010] clinicians (one from 
Clinical Development and one from Global Safety )who collectively have experience in 
oncology clinical research and in the conduct and monitoring of randomized clinical 
trials. In addition , the DRT may include one or more external clinical expert(s) ( eg, a 
surgical oncologist in melanoma) not directly involved in the conduct of the study. The 
DRT will be supported by a statistician internal to [COMPANY_010] but independent of the 
talimogene laherparepvec product team .  The DRT will review unblinded safety data at 
the first interim analys is. This independent DRT will be governed by a study -specific 
DRT charter.
10.4.3 Primary Analysis
The primary a nalyses for RFS will occur at the later time of either the occurrence of 
approximately 64 events ( local, regional, or distant recurrence of melanoma or death ) or 
approximately 2 years after end of randomization .The primary analysis for certain 
secondary endpoints will be performed using the data from the second interim analysis 
(eg, resp onse to neoadjuvant treatment, R0 resection, pCR , exploratory correlative 
endpoints related to neoadjuvant treatment outcomes , and safety).

repeated stratifying on actual rather than planned adjuvant therapy and/or adjuvant 
therapy containing sel ected types of immunotherapy. Multivariate proportional hazards 
models may be used to explore the prognostic and/or predictive value of baseline 
factors.
10.5.3 Secondary  Efficacy Endpoints
KM estimates will be calculated for RFS, LRFS, RRFS, DMFS, OS landmarks 
(1-,2-, 3-and 5 -year rates) and quartiles.  Greenwood’s formula ( Kalbfleisch and
Prentice, 1980 ) for standard error will be used to calculate CIs for each group and 
between -group differences in landmark KM rate estimates.  CIs for quartiles of each 
group will be estimated per Brookmeyer and Crowley ( Brookmeyer and Crowley ,1982 ) 
and bootstrap methods will be used to estimate CIs for between -group differences.  For 
each group the equal -precision band method will be used to calculate a simultaneous 
confidence band for RFS, LRFS, RRFS, and DM FS over the interval from 1to 5years 
(Nair, 1984).  An overall between -group difference in RFS, LRFS, RRFS, DMFS, and OS 
will be evaluated with a log-rank test and corresponding proportional hazard model with 
or withou tstratification by [CONTACT_702308].  If warranted due to actual 
adjuvant therapy, these analyses will be repeated stratifying on actual rather than 
planned adjuvant therapy and/or adjuvant therapy containing selected types of 
immunotherapy. Multivariate proportional hazards models may be used to explore the 
prognostic and/or predictive value of baseline factors.

CONFIDENTIA LThe Clopper -Pearson method ( Clopper and Pearson , 1934 ) will be used to calculate 
exact CIs for binary endpoints (eg, overall tumor response , response in injected and 
uninjected lesions, R0 rate, pCR).  Wilson’s score method with continuity correction 
(Newcombe, 1998 ) will be used to calculate an approximate exact CI for between -group 
differences in binary rates. Multivariate logistic models may be used to explore the 
prognostic and/or predictive value of baseline factors.

events, grade ≥ [ADDRESS_953390] and events requiring the discontinuation of study drug, local effects on 
the tumor [ie, pain, inflammation and ulceration]) will be summarized.  The Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) will be us ed to code adverse events to a 
system organ class (SOC) and a preferred term within the SOC. The CTCAE 
version 3.0 will be used to grade severity of adverse events.  In addition ,clinically 
significant laboratory changes and clinically significant changes in vital signs will be 
summarized with descriptive statistics. Summary statistics will also be provided for 
concomitant medications, adjuvant therapy, dose delay, study drug discontinuation, 
overall exposure, and changes in ECOG performance status.  Tabl es and/or narratives 
of deaths through [ADDRESS_953391] dose of talimogene laherparepvec or 
surgery will be provided.  The incidence of subjects with herpetic lesions found to be 
positive for talimogene laherparepvec DNA per qPCR in swa b samples collected from 
lesions suspected to be herpetic in origin and the rate of positive lesions (if any) will be 
calculated.    Potential or known unintended exposure to talimogene laherparepvec, 
related suspected signs or symptoms, and detection of t alimogene laherparepvec in a 
subject’s household member, caregiver, or healthcare provider will be reported.
When appropriate ,the safety data during the talimogene laherparepvec monotherapy 
period before surgical resection will be summarized separately fr om the safety data after 
surgical section, which will be summarized by [CONTACT_96003].

CONFIDENTIA LAppendix D.  Modified World Health Orga nization (WHO) Response Criteria
A modified version of the W orld Health Organization ( WHO) response criteria 
(WHOhandbook for reporting results of cancer treatment, 1979 ) will be employed in this 
study. Because cutaneous melanoma lesions may be irregular ly shaped, W HO criteria 
using longest perpendicular diameters rather than Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid 
Tumors ( RECIST )using single dimension measurement are preferred for evaluating 
tumor response.
Method of Measurement of Melanoma Tumor Lesions
Clinical Examination Using Caliper : All measurements will be determined using a 
ruler or calipers and reported in metric notati on (mm) and will be recorded 
bi-dimensionally. Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are 
superficial and ≥10mm in at least 2 dimensions as assessed using calipers 
(eg,superficial cutaneous melanoma lesion ). (Note: When a lesion can be evaluated by 
[CONTACT_17588], clinical examination and imaging, radiographic imaging evaluations should be 
preferred since it is more objective).
CT scans (or MRI): Computed tomography (CT) scans by [CONTACT_22242] -enhanced or spi[INVESTIGATOR_702255] (or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] scan) will be performed to evaluate tumor 
response for nodal/soft tissue disease (including lymph nodes) .  Measurabi lity of lesions 
on CT scans is based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is [ADDRESS_953415] or to MRI (or vice versa) should 
not preclude response assessment if, in the judgment of the site radiologist, there is no 
significant difference in the assessment by [CONTACT_44932].  This may occur if a 
subject has developed a medical contraindication to intravenous contrast for CT scans 
while on trial.  This change would require the preapproval of the sponsor ’smedical 
monitor.
Positron Emission Tomography  (PET)/CT Scans:   If a combined PET/CT scan is 
performed at the discretion of the investigator, the CT portion of that exam should not be 
substituted for the dedicated CT exams required by [CONTACT_3181].  The PET portion of the 
Product:  Talimogene Laherparepvec
Protocol Number:  20110266
Date:  [ADDRESS_953416] performed as part of a PET/CT is of identical 
diagnostic quality to a diagnostic CT (with intravenous and oral contrast) then th e 
CTportion of the PET/CT can be used for tumor measurements.
Ultrasound: Ultrasound may be used to assess superficial palpable lymph nodes and 
subcutaneous lesions where ultrasound provides a more accurate measure than clinical 
measurement, CT or MRI .  In addition, ultrasound can be useful to confirm the complete 
disappearance of superficial lesions usually assessed by [CONTACT_12148].  However, 
if ultrasound is not useful in assessment of lesion size it must not be used as a method 
of measurement. If new lesions are identified by [CONTACT_12153], 
confirmation by [CONTACT_12154].
Measureable Disease 
Measurability is defined by [CONTACT_702309] a lesion bi -dimensionally with surface 
area determined by [CONTACT_702310].  An individual lesion measure is therefore provided 
by [CONTACT_1565] a tumor’s longest diameter and the diameter perpendicular to that.
All measurements will be dete rmined using a ruler or calipers and reported in metric 
notation (mm) and will be recorded bi -dimensionally.
Definitions of Measurable and Nonmeasurable:
At baseline (the last assessment on or prior to the first dose of talimogene laherparepvec 
[Arm1] or prior to surgery [ Arm2]), tumor lesions will be categorized as follows: 
measurable or 
nonmeasurable but evaluable 
Measurable Lesions:
Measurable lesions are defined at baseline as lesions that can be accurately and serially 
measured in at least [ADDRESS_953417] 
2dimensions is:
≥ [ADDRESS_953418] scan, MRI, or ultrasound for nodal/soft tissue disease 
(including lymph nodes)
≥10 mm caliper measurement by [CONTACT_702311]
multiple superficial mela noma lesions which in aggregate have a total diameter of 
≥[ADDRESS_953419]:  Talimogene Laherparepvec
Protocol Number:  20110266
Date:  23 March 2018 Page 92of 100
CONFIDENTIA LNonmeasurable Lesions:
All other lesions, including small lesions (longest diameter < [ADDRESS_953420]/MRI/ultrasound for nodal/soft tissue disease [including lymph nodes] or < 10mm 
caliper measu rement by [CONTACT_702312]) and 
other truly nonmeasurable lesions are considered nonmeasurable and characterized as 
nonindex lesions.  This will include any measurable lesions beyond the maximum 
number of 10 lesions t hat were not chosen as index lesions.
Lesions with Prior Local Treatment:
Tumor lesions situated in a previously irradiate area, or an area subject to other 
loco-regional therapy, are usually not considered measurable unless there has been 
demonstrated pro gression in the lesion.
Coalescing or Splitting Lesions:
Coalescing lesions:  When two or more lesions merge and at least one is an index 
lesion, the largest index lesion prior to merging should be measured and reported during 
the tumor response assessment . All other merged lesions should be reported as 
0mm x 0 mm (for lesions previously reported as Index or New Measurable Lesions) or 
absent (for lesions previously reported as Non -Index or New Non -Measurable Lesions).
If two or more non -index lesions merge, the apparently larger lesion should be reported 
as present, and smaller lesion( -s) should be reported as absent. The indication that the 
lesion coalesced with the specified lesion( -s) should be provided for each merged lesion.
Splitting lesions:  When an index lesion splits into two or more lesions the largest 
measurable part of the split lesion will be measured for the current assessment with the 
indication that the lesion split from the specified lesion, and followed for future 
assessments. The rem aining lesions will be measured as new lesions with an indication 
that the lesion split from the specified lesion. In this case, appearance of a new lesion 
from a previous lesion that split will not be considered disease progression solely due to 
appearance of a new lesion (may be consider ed disease progression due to > 25% 
increase in the sum of the products of the perpendicular diameters of all index tumors 
since baseline, or the unequivocal appearance of a new tumor, other than the product of 
the split tumor, since the last response assessment time point).
When an non -index lesion splits into two or more lesions, the apparently larger lesion will 
be reported as a non-index lesion. All other smaller lesi ons will be reported as new 
non-index lesions with an indication that the lesion split from the specified lesion. In this 
case, appearance of a new lesion from a previous lesion that split will not be considered

CONFIDENTIA Ldisease progression solely due to appearance of a new lesion (may be considered 
disease progression due to > 25% increase in the sum of the products of the 
perpendicular diameters of all index tumors since baseline, or the unequivocal 
appearance of a new tumor, other than the product of the split tumor, since the last 
response assessment time point ).
Measureable Tumor A ssessment/Burden:
Baseline Documentation of “Index Lesions”:
All baseline evaluations should be performed as close as possible to randomization and 
never more than 4 weeks (ie, 28 days) prior to randomization .
At baseline, up to [ADDRESS_953421]’s overall disease status.  Index lesions should be selected 
on the basis of their size (lesions with longest bi -dimensionally perpendicular diameters) 
and suitability for accurate repeated measurements by [CONTACT_15218] (CT, MRI or 
ultrasound) and/or other method such as clinical exam.
The sum of t he products of the largest perpendicular diameters of all index lesions will 
be calculated and reported.
If a subject has multiple small superficial cutaneous melanoma lesions at baseline ( each 
lesions is less than [ADDRESS_953422] 2dimensions ) which in aggregate have a total 
diameter of ≥ [ADDRESS_953423] lesions that were included 
in this measurement will be reported as ”Index Lesion s”, and the sum of the products of 
the two largest perpendicular diameters of these lesions will be calculated and reported 
for tumor response assessments.
Baseline Documentation of “ Nonindex Lesions”: 
All other lesions (or sites of disease), including any measurable lesions that were not 
chosen as index lesions will be identified as nonindex lesions .  
Nonindex lesion sshould 
be recorded and assessed qualitatively over the course of therapy.
Follo w-up “Index Lesions” :
At each subsequent tumor assessment, the sum of the products of the two largest 
perpendicular diameters of the index lesions are added together to provid e the total 
tumor burden.
Product:  Talimogene Laherparepvec
Protocol Number:  20110266
Date:  23 March 2018 Page 94of 100
CONFIDENTIA LFollo w-up “Nonindex Lesions” :
Nonindex disease measurements are not required and these lesions should be followed 
as “present”, “absent”, or in rare cases “unequivocal progression”.
Follo w-up “New Lesion s”:
At tumor assessment, if new measurable lesions have appeared they should be added 
to sum of the products of the two largest perpendicular diameters of the index lesions to 
provide the total tumor burden. For non measurable new lesion they should be followed 
as nonindex lesion as“present”, “absent”, or in rare cases “unequivocal progression”.   If 
a new lesion(s) that appears in between scheduled tumor response assessments 
disappear(s) before the next scheduled assessment, there is no need to include this 
lesion for tumor response evaluation. 
Response Criteria
Evaluation of Objective Response:
The subject response will be assessed based on the response of the index lesions and 
nonindex lesion, and presence or absence of new lesions. Conf irmation of complete or 
partial response is not required. The overall response is derived from time point 
response assessments as described in Table [ADDRESS_953424]:  Talimogene Laherparepvec

CONFIDENTIA LAppendix F.  Surgery Guidelines
The decision to perform surgery on subjects with stage IIIB, IIIC or IV M1a melanoma 
(dermal, subcutaneous or non -regional lymph node metastases) is a complex clinical 
decision making process that must be based on good clinical judgment thatmay include
consulting with other relevant medical specialities, and considering patient’s 
preferences . Eligible subjects for surgical resection must have metastatic disease that in 
the judgment of the investigator is deemed completely surgically resectable Eligible 
subjects may either present with a primary melanoma and evidence of concurrent 
dermal, subcutaneous or clinically palpable lymph node metastasis, or may have 
previously had a primary melanoma and subsequently develop recurrence. Subjects 
who present with metastasis from an unknown primary melanoma are also eligible to 
participate.   
1) Definition of IIIB or IIIC Metastasis: Eligible subjects with stage IIIB or IIIC 
melanoma have histopathologically confirmed melanoma metastasis in:
a) the dermis or subcutaneous tissue at, or close to the site of a primary 
cutaneous melanoma, an d/or
b) the lymphatic channels (satellite, in -transit, or intralymphatic metastasis) 
draining a primary cutaneous melanoma site, and/or
c) the regional lymph nodes draining a primary cutaneous melanoma site
2) Definition of IVM1a Metastasis: IVM1a means metastasis to distant skin, 
subcutaneous tissues, or lymph nodes. Subjects eligible for the protocol must 
have melanoma metastasis to a skin or soft tissue site beyond the potential 
lymph drainage basins of the primary site, or to lymph nodes beyond the 
potential l ymph drainage pathways regional to the primary site.
3) Surgical Margins : The goal of surgery is to completely resect all metastases with 
adequate margins to avoid local recurrence. The surgeon should always attempt 
to get negative margins and be well beyon d the palpable tumor. In subjects with 
dermal or subcutaneous metastasis, wide margin resection beyond [ADDRESS_953426].
4) Handling of Surgical Specimen(s): It is recommended that surgeon will mark the 
lesion (s)(or the area if CR was achieved) with the suture that was injected with 
talimogene laherparepvec. Complete surgery report and surgical pathology 
report have to be recorded in CRF. For additional information on handling of 
surgical specimen srefer to Laboratory Manual.

CONFIDENTIA LGuidelines for Lymphadenectomy
1) Axillary Dissection: A complete axillary lymph node dissection should include all 
three levels of node -bearing axillary tissue. The borders of dissection include 
superior along the axillar y vein from the thoracic inlet (Halsted's ligament) to the 
latissimus dorsi tendon. The medial border is the intercostal and serratus 
anterior muscles on the chest wall. The lateral border is the edge of the 
latissimus dorsi muscle, and the inferior border is the fourth intercostal space. 
The dissection should extend to the subscapular muscle. All fat and lymphatic 
tissue should be resected from the axilla and the long thoracic and thoracodorsal 
neurovascular bundle should be preserved unless involved w ith tumor . The 
pectoral minor muscle may be transected or removed if necessary to assure 
complete dissection of Level III nodes. Drainage of the resection bed with a 
closed suction drain is recommended. The minimum number of nodes assessed 
from the axil lary region is 15.
2) Inguinal Dissection: Borders of dissection should be superior :  along the lower 
abdomen 5 cm above and parallel to the inguinal ligament, inferior to the apex of 
the femoral triangle, medially along the medial border of the adductor mag nus 
muscle, and laterally along the lateral border of the sartorius muscle. The fatty 
tissue and lymphatic tissue overlying the femoral vessels and nerve are removed 
up to the inguinal ligament. Removal of the node of Cloquet is recommended. 
Drainage of the resection bed with a closed suction drain is recommended. The 
minimum number of nodes assessed from the superficial inguinal region is 8. A 
deep groin dissection is required if inguinal nodes are (a) clinically positive 
(palpable) and there are 3 or more positive inguinal nodes, (b) positive matted 
nodes or (c ) the node of Cloquet is microscopi[INVESTIGATOR_702256]. A deep groin dissection of the 
common and external iliac, hypogastric, and ob turator nodes should be 
performed by [CONTACT_702313] a separate 
incision through the abdominal musculature above and parallel to the inguinal 
ligament, or by [CONTACT_702314]. Drainage of the resection bed 
with a closed suction drain is recommended. The minimum number of nodes 
assessed from the deep groin region is 4.
3) Popliteal Region: The popliteal fossa lymph node dissection should contain the 
lymph nodes bordered laterally and superiorly by [CONTACT_702315].
The inferior margins are the lateral and medial heads of the gastrocnemius 
muscles. The roof of the fossa is bordered by [CONTACT_702316], superficial 
fascia and skin. Usually ligation of the lesser saphenous vein is necessary for 
complete excision of the lymph nodes in this site. Drainage of the resection bed 
with a closed suct ion drain is recommended. The minimum number of nodes 
assessed from the popliteal region is 3.

CONFIDENTIA L4) Neck Dissection : Either a classic radical or modified neck dissection preserving 
the spi[INVESTIGATOR_702257]. In 
subjects who present with a primary melanoma on the anterior scalp, face or ear 
and concurrent palpable biopsy proven neck lymph node metastasis, a 
lymphoscintigraphy is recommended to assess possible drainage to the 
superficial parotid gland. If there is evidence of drainage to parotid lymph nodes, 
a superficial parotidectomy is required to remove the parotid nodes along with 
the neck lymph nodes. The borders of the neck dissection are inferior to the 
clavicle, superior to the mandible, mastoid and tail of the parotid gland, posterior 
to the anterior border of the of the trapezius muscle, and anterior to the strap 
muscles. Contents of the digastric triangles should be resected and the spi[INVESTIGATOR_702258]. Drainage of the resection bed with a closed suction drain is 
recommended. The minimum numbers of nodes assessed from the neck region 
are as follows: (a) anterior cervical, including suprahyoid, jugulardigastric is
15;(b) poste rior cervical, including supraclavicular is 15. Selected neck 
dissection could be considered in some circumstances, such as metastasis to 
submental nodes or very low cervical nodes from a medial shoulder primary 
melanoma.

CONFIDENTIAL    Superseding Amendment 2 
Protocol Title:  A Phase 2, Multicenter, Randomized, Open-label Trial Assessing 
the Efficacy and Safety of Talimogene Laherparepvec Neoadjuvant Treatment Plus 
Surgery Versus Surgery Alone for Resectable, Stage IIIB to IVM1a Melanoma 
 
[COMPANY_010] Protocol Number 20110266 
 
Amendment Date: 22 April  2016 
 
Rationale:  
The Superseding Amendment 2 was written to:  
• Correct the numbering of the exclusion criteria in Amendment 2 
• Update sponsor contact  
[CONTACT_702318]:  
• Secondary objective 
An objective of regional recurrence-free survival (RRFS)  was added to the following 
secondary objective “To estimate the effect of neoadjuvant talimogene laherparepvec 
plus surgery compared to surgery alone on local recurrence- free survival (LRFS) and 
distant metastases -free survival (DMFS) ” to better characterize patterns of recurrences 
of melanoma, which include not only local and distant, but also regional  recurrences.  
• Secondary endpoint 
Regional recurrence-free survival was added to the secondary endpoints in parallel to 
this addition to the secondary ob jective. 
• Distant metastases free survival  
The efficacy endpoint of DMFS was clarified by [CONTACT_702319].  
• Adjuvant ipi[INVESTIGATOR_702259] 
(FDA) for the adjuvant treatment of patients with cutaneous melanoma with pathologic 
involvement of regional lymph nodes of more than [ADDRESS_953434]:  Talimogene Laherparepvec 
Protocol Number:  20110266  
Date:  22 April  2016 Page 2 of 25 
CONFIDENTIAL    • Marketing information on talimogene laherparepvec 
Marketing information on talimogene laherparepvec (Imlygic ) was added to the 
Introduction to update the background section because it was recently approved by 
[CONTACT_702320], Europe, and Australia. 
• Randomization stratification 
Stratification by [CONTACT_123594] i nterferon use was replaced with adjuvant systemic therapy to 
include interferon al pha (INFα) and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_702260].  
• Number of sites 
The number of sites was changed from 40 to 50 to achieve the enrollment goal. • Safety follow -up 
The 30-day safety follow -up was modified to specify that subjects will be followed for 
local, regional, and distant disease recurrence and for melanoma and adverse events 
thought to be potentially related to talimogene laherparepvec to align with the schedule 
of assessment in the Registry Study 20120139.   The protocol was also changed to 
specify that subjects who participate in [ADDRESS_953435] sign a new informed consent 
form. 
• Measurable disease inclusion criterion  
Inclusion criterion 106 was clarified to specify that the measurement of the lesion 
diameter “in at least 2 dimensions” is ≥ 10 mm to align with other talimogene 
laherparepvec studies .  Also, measurement using ultrasound for superficial lymph nodes 
and subcutaneous lesions was added. 
• Serum lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH) level inclusion criterion 
Inclusion criterion 108 was changed as follows:  Serum LDH level ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of 
normal (ULN) for s tages IIIB and IIIC melanoma and ≤ 1.[ADDRESS_953436] for Stage IVM1a 
melanoma within 28 days prior to randomization, since LDH is not a staging component 
for Stage III melanoma. • Serum alb umin inclusion criterion 
Inclusion criterion 109 was modified to include serum albumin ≥  2.5 g/dL to align with 
other talimogene laherparepvec studies . 
Product:  Talimogene Laherparepvec 
Protocol Number:  20110266  
Date:  22 April  2016 Page 3 of 25 
CONFIDENTIAL    • Autoimmune disease exclusion criterion  
Exclusion criterion 204 was expanded to clarify symptomatic autoimmune disease to 
align with the same criterion in other talimogene laherparepvec  monotherapy studies.  
• Clinically significant immunosuppression 
The definition of clinically significant immunosuppression was updated in exclusion 
criterion 205 to align with other talimogene laherparepvec  monotherapy studies.  
• Tumor vaccine exclusion criterion 
Exclusion criterion 212 (prior therapy with tumor vaccine) was deleted to align with other  
talimogene laherparepvec  monotherapy studies.  
• Viral transmission during sexual contact e xclusion criterion 
The criterion (216) to exclude sexually active subjects and their partners unwilling to use 
male or female latex condoms to avoid potential viral transmission during sexual contact 
[CONTACT_702321] a condition of marketing approval and to align with other talimogene 
laherparepvec  studies.  
• Talimogene laherparepvec vials 
Each vial contains a minimum of 1.0 m L talimogene laherparepvec  at either 106 PFU/mL 
or 108 PFU/mL concentrations.  The description of the two vial concentrations as green 
cap and blue cap, respectively, were deleted since they no longer apply.  
• Treatment procedures 
The following statement was added to stress the need to report adjuvant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], if 
planned, via Interactive Voice Response ( IVR):  If adjuvant therapy (systemic and/or 
radiation therapy; approved or investigational) is planned, this should be reported via IVR at randomization. 
• Reporting of potentially talimogene laherparepvec related adverse events 
during long-term follow -up 
Adverse events  deemed by [CONTACT_702322] (Arm 1 only) and use of subsequent anticancer therapy for mel anoma will 
be collected during long- term follow -up to align this protocol with all other talimogene 
laherparepvec studies.  
• Activated PTT  
Activated thromboplastin time was added as an alternative to PTT in screening 
laboratory tests because it may be an alternative test of choice for testing coagulation. 
Product:  Talimogene Laherparepvec 
Protocol Number:  20110266  
Date:  22 April  2016 Page 4 of 25 
CONFIDENTIAL    • Physical examination and ECOG performance status 
Required physical examination and ECOG performance status was added at weeks 4 
and 8 to report any change in a patient’s performance status.  
• Oral and genital swab bing after surgery 
Oral and genital swabbing for  real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and 50% 
Tissue Culture Infective Dose (TCID50) assay  testing was removed from the safety 
follow -up visit because identical information is currently being collected in 
Study  20120324.  
• Safety Follow -up p rocedures 
Surgical safety evaluation and recording of subsequent anticancer therapy for melanoma 
were added to safety follow -up procedures to align the schedule of assessment in the 
Registry Study 20120139. 
• Pregnancy and lactation reporting 
Reference to [COMPANY_010]’s global Pregnancy and Lactation Surveillance Program s was 
deleted and replaced by [CONTACT_702323].  
• Statistical considerations 
RRFS analysis was added to meet the addition of RRFS to the secondary objectives. 
The protocol was modified to clarify that a DRT will review the first interim analysis and 
the talimogene laherparepvec product team will review the second interim analysis , 
since the second analysis  will be performed after all subjects in Arm [ADDRESS_953437] team  will also review some 
efficacy endpoints (eg, R0 resection rate, pCR rate, response to neoadjuvant treatment). 
Ad hoc analyses, executed by [CONTACT_702324], for safety or 
some efficacy endpoints may be conducted before the planned primary or final analyses  
if interim data are required for submission to regulatory authorities.  
• Sample size 
In the statement regarding s ubjects who are not confirmed to be disease- free 
post-surgery or who withdraw prior to surgery, failure was changed from at 
randomization to “a day after randomization” for RFS.  With this change, the number of 
subjects at risk at the earliest possible time (randomization +1 day) would not change

Protocol Number:  20110266  
Date:  [ADDRESS_953438] results.  
• Trial integrity document  
The mention of using a Trial Integrity Document was deleted to comply with current 
standard operating procedures .  
• Index lesions 
Language was added to Appendix D (d ocumentation of i ndex lesions) to clarify the 
recording of aggregate lesions and to  align with other talimogene laherparepvec  
monotherapy studies.  
• Definition of p rogressive disease for measurable disease  
The definition of progressive disease (PD) was changed to clarify that PD includes the unequivocal appearance of a new measurable lesion since the last response assessment time point, to align with other talimogene laherparepvec studies.  
• Appendix F 
Appendix F was modified to state that the decision to perform surgery may include 
consulting with other relevant medical spec ialties  and consider ation of a patient’s 
preferences , to provide guidance on the decision making proces s of resection of 
melanoma.
 
• Administrative 
Minor text clarifications, additions, and corrections as well as  typographical and 
formatting changes were made throughout the protocol.  The key sponsor contact 
[CONTACT_702325].  New 
references were added as needed for newly added text.

CONFIDENTIAL    Add: Recently, talimogene laherparepvec (Imlygic™) was approved in 
the US A for the local treatment of unresectable cutaneous, 
subcutaneous, and nodal lesions in patients with melanoma 
recurrent after initial surgery (with limitation of use:  Imlygic has 
not been shown to improve overall survival or have an effect on 
visceral metastases) (Imlygic™ Prescribing Information, 2015), in 
Europe for the treatment of adults with unresectable melanoma that is regionally  or distantly metastatic ( stage IIIB, IIIC, and 
IVM1a) with no bone, brain, lung or other visceral disease 
(Imlygic™ Summary of Product Chara cteristics, 2015), and in 
Australia as monotherapy  for the treatment of melanoma in 
patients with unresectable cutaneous, subcutaneous, or nodal 
lesions after initial surgery (Imlygic™ Prescribing Information,

CONFIDENTIAL    Add: Coalescing or Splitting Lesions:  
Coalescing lesions:  When two or more lesions merge and at 
least one is an index lesion, the largest index lesion prior to 
merging should be measured and reported during the tumor 
response assessment.  All other merged lesions should be 
reported as 0 mm x 0 mm (for lesions previously reported as Index or New Measurable Lesions) or absent (for lesions previously reported as Non-Index or New Non -Measurable 
Lesions).  If two or more non-index lesions merge, the apparently 
larger lesion should be reported as present, and smaller lesion( -s) 
should be reported as absent.  The indication that the lesion 
coalesced with the specified lesion( -s) should be provided for 
each merged lesion. 
Splitting lesions:  When an index lesion splits into two or more 
lesions the largest measurable part of the split lesion will be 
measured for the current assessment with the indication that the lesion split from the specified lesion, and followed for future assessments.  The remaining lesions will be measured as new lesions with an indication that the lesion split from the specified 
lesion.  In this case, appearance of a new lesion from a previous 
lesion that split

When an non-index lesion splits into two or more lesions, the apparently larger lesion will be reported as a non-index lesion.  All other smaller lesions will be reported as new non-index 
lesions with an indication that the lesion split from the specified

before the next scheduled assessment, there is no need to 
include this lesion for tumor response evaluation.

CONFIDENTIAL    Amendment 2 
Protocol Title:  A Phase 2, Multicenter, Randomized, Open- label Trial Assessing 
the Efficacy and Safety of Talimogene Laherparepvec Neoadjuvant Treatment Plus 
Surgery Versus Surgery Alone for Resectable, Stage IIIB to IVM1a Melanoma  
 
[COMPANY_010] Prot ocol Number 20110266  
 
Amendment Date:  31 March 2016 
 
Rationale:  
The key protocol changes are :  
• Secondary objective  
An objective of r egional recurrence -free survival (RRFS)  was added to the following 
secondary objective “ To estimate the effect of neoadjuvant talimogene laherparepvec 
plus surgery compared to surgery alone on local recurrence- free survival (LRFS) and 
distant metastases -free survival (DMFS) ” to better characterize patterns of recurrences 
of melanoma , which include not only local and distant, but also regional  recurrences.   
• Secondary endpoint  
Regional recurrence -free survival was added to the secondary endpoints in  parallel to 
this addition to the secondary ob jective.  
• Distant metastases free survival  
The efficacy endpoint of DMFS was clarified by [CONTACT_702334].  
• Adjuvant ipi[INVESTIGATOR_702266] 
(FDA) for the adjuvant treatment of patients with cutaneous melanoma with pathologic 
involvement of regional lymph nodes of more than [ADDRESS_953488] undergone complete 
resection, including total lymphadenectomy . 
• Marketing information on talimogene laherparepvec  
Marketing information on talimogene laherparepvec (Imlygic™) was added to the 
Introduction to update the background section because it was recently approved by 
[CONTACT_702320], Europe, and Australia.  
Product:  Talimogene Laherparepvec  
Protocol Number:  20110266  
Date:  31 March 2016  Page 2 of 25 
CONFIDENTIAL    • Randomization stratificat ion 
Stratification by [CONTACT_123594] i nterferon use was replaced with adjuvant systemic therapy to 
include interferon alpha ( INFα ) and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_702260].  
• Number of sites  
The number of sites was changed from 40 to 50  to achieve the enrollment goal. 
• Safety follow -up 
The 30- day safety follow- up was modified to specify that subjects will be followed for 
local, regional, and distant  disease recurrence and for melanoma and adverse events 
thought to be potentially related t o talimogene laherparepvec to align with the schedule 
of assessment in the Registry Study 20120139.   The protocol was also changed to 
specify that subjects who participate in [ADDRESS_953489] sign a new informed consent 
form. 
• Measurable disease inclusion crit erion  
Inclusion criterion 106 was clarified to specify that the measurement of the lesion  
diameter “in at least 2 dimensions” is ≥ 10 mm to align with other talimogene 
laherparepvec studies .  Also, measurement using ultrasound for superficial lymph nodes 
and subcutaneous lesions was added.  
• Serum lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH) level inclusion criterion  
Inclusion criterion 108 was changed as follows:  Serum LDH level ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of 
normal (ULN) for s tages IIIB and IIIC melanoma and ≤ 1.[ADDRESS_953490] for Stage IVM1a 
melanoma within 28 days prior to randomization, since LDH is not a staging component 
for Stage III melanoma. 
• Serum al bumin inclusion criterion  
Inclusion criterion 109 was modified to include serum albumin ≥ 2.5 g/dL  to align with 
other talimogene laherparepvec studies . 
• Autoimmune disease exclusion criterion  
Exclusion criterion 204 was expanded to clarify symptomatic autoimmune disease to 
align with the same criterion in other talimogene laherparepvec  monotherapy studies.  
• Clinically significant immunosuppression  
The definition of clinically significant immunosuppression was updated in exclusion 
criterion [ADDRESS_953491]:  Talimogene Laherparepvec  
Protocol Number:  20110266  
Date:  31 March 2016  Page 3 of 25 
CONFIDENTIAL    • Tumor vaccine exclusion criterion  
Exclusion criterion 212 (prior therapy with t umor vaccine) was deleted to align with other  
talimogene laherparepvec  monotherapy studies.  
• Viral transmission during sexual contact [CONTACT_702335] (216) to exclude sexually active subjects and their partners unwilling to use 
male or fem ale latex condoms to avoid potential viral transmission during sexual contact 
[CONTACT_702321] a condition of marketing approval and to align with other talimogene 
laherparepvec  studies.  
• Talimogene laherparepvec vials 
Each vial contains a minimum of 1.0 mL tal imogene laherparepvec  at either 1 06 PFU/mL 
or 108 PFU/mL concentrations.  The description of the two vial concentrations as green 
cap and blue cap, respectively, were deleted since they no longer apply.  
• Treatment procedures  
The following statement was added to stress the need to report adjuvant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], if planned, via Interactive Voice Response (IVR ):  If adjuvant therapy (systemic and/or 
radiation therapy; approved or investigational) is planned, this should be reported via IVR at randomization.  
• Report ing of potentially talimogene laherparepvec related adverse events 
during long- term follow -up 
Adverse events  deemed by [CONTACT_702272] t alimogene 
laherparepvec (Arm 1 only) and use of subsequent anticancer therapy for melanoma will 
be collected during long -term follow -up to align this protocol with all other talimogene  
laherparepvec studies. 
• Activated PTT  
Activated thromboplastin time was added as an alternative to PTT in screening 
laboratory tests because it may be an alternative test of choice for testing coagulation.  
• Physical examination and ECOG performance status  
Required physical examination and ECOG performance status was added  at weeks 4 
and 8 to report any change in a patient’s performance status. 
• Oral and genital swabbing  after surgery  
Oral and genital swabbing for real-time polymerase chain reaction ( qPCR) and 50% 
Tissue Culture Infective Dose (TCID50) assay  testing was removed from the safety

Date:  31 March 2016  Page 4 of 25 
CONFIDENTIAL    follow -up visit because identical information is currently being collected in 
Study  20120324.  
• Safety Follow -up procedures 
Surgical safety evaluation and recording of subsequent anticancer therapy for melanoma 
were added to safety follow -up procedures to align the schedule of assessment in the 
Registry Study 20120139.  
• Pregnancy and lactation reporting  
Reference to [COMPANY_010]’s global Pregnancy and Lactation Surveillance Program s was 
deleted and replaced by [CONTACT_702323].  
• Statistical considerations 
RRFS analysis was added to meet the addition of RRFS to the secondary objectives.  
The protocol was modified to clarify that a DRT will review the first interim analysis and 
the talimogene laherparepvec product team will review the second interim analysis , 
since the second  analysis  will be performed after all subjects in Arm [ADDRESS_953492] team  will also review some 
efficacy endpoints (eg, R0 resection rate, pCR rate, response to neoadjuvant treatment).  
Ad hoc analyses, executed by [CONTACT_702336],  for safety or 
some efficacy endpoints may be conducted before the planned primary or final analyses  
if interim data are  required for submission to regulatory authorities.  
• Sample size  
In the statement regarding s ubjects who are not confirmed to be disease- free 
post-surgery or who withdraw prior to surgery, failure was changed from at 
randomization to “ a day after randomization” for RFS.   With this change, the number of 
subjects at risk at the earliest possible time (randomization +1 day) would not change due to non- melanoma subjects, and would reduce the impact on the Cox model, 
Kaplan- Meier, and log- rank test results.  
• Trial integrity document  
The mention of using a Trial Integrity Document was deleted to comply with current 
standard operating procedures .  
Product:  Talimogene Laherparepvec  
Protocol Number:  20110266  
Date:  31 March 2016  Page 5 of 25 
CONFIDENTIAL    • Index lesions  
Language was added to Appendix D  (documentation of i ndex lesions) to clarify the 
recording of aggregate lesions and to  align with other talimogene laherparepvec  
monotherapy studies.  
• Definition of progressive disease for measurable disease  
The definition of progressive disease (PD) was changed to clarify that PD includes the 
unequivocal appearance of a new measurable lesion since the last response 
assessment time point, to align with other talimogene laherparepvec studies.  
• Appendix F 
Appendix F was modified to state that the decision to perform surgery may include 
consulting with other relevant medical spec ialties  and consider ation  of a patient’s 
preferences , to provide guidance on the decision making process of resection of 
melanoma.  
• Administrative  
Minor text clarifications, additions, and corrections as well as  typographical and 
formatting changes were made throughout the protocol.   The key sponsor contact 
[CONTACT_702325].  New 
references were added as needed for newly added text.

CONFIDENTIAL    Add: Recently, talimogene laherparepvec (Imlygic™) was approved in 
the US A for the local  treatment of unresectable cutaneous, 
subcutaneous, and nodal lesions in patients with melanoma 
recurrent after initial surgery (with limitation of use :  Imlygic has 
not been shown to improve overall survival  or have an effect on 
visceral metastases) ( Imlygic ™ Prescribing Information, 2015 ), in 
Europe for the treatment of adults with unresectable melanoma 
that is regionally  or distantly metastatic ( stage IIIB, IIIC , and 
IVM1a) with no bone, brain, lung or other visceral disease 
(Imlygic ™ Summary of Product Chara cteristics , 2015 ), and in 
Australia as monotherapy  for the treatment of melanoma in 
patients with unresectable cutaneous, subcutaneous, or nodal lesions after initial surgery ( Imlygic ™ Prescribing Information,

CONFIDENTIAL    Add: Coalescing or Splitting Lesions:  
Coalescing lesions:  When two or more lesions merge and at 
least one is an index lesion, the largest index lesion prior to 
merging should be measured and reported during the tumor 
response assessment.  All other merged lesions should be 
reported as 0 mm x 0 mm (for lesions previously reported as Index or New Measurable Lesions) or absent (for lesions 
previously reported as Non- Index or New Non -Measurable 
Lesions).  If two or more non- index lesions merge, the apparently 
larger lesion should be reported as present, and smaller lesion( -s) 
should be reported as absent.  The indication that the lesion 
coalesced with the specified lesion( -s) should be provided for 
each merged lesion.  
Splitting lesions:  When an index lesion splits into two or more 
lesions the largest measurable part of the split lesion will be measured for the current assessment with the indication that the 
lesion split from the specified lesion, and followed for future 
assessments.  The remaining lesions will be measured as new lesions with an indication that the lesion split from the specified 
lesion.  In this case, appearance of a new lesion from a previous 
lesion that split will not
 be considered disease progression solely 
due to appearance of a new lesion (may be considered disease progression due to > 25% increase in the sum of the products of the perpendicular diameters of all index tumors since baseline, or 
the unequivocal appearance of a new tumor, other than the product of the split tumor, since the last response assessment 
time point).  
When an non- index lesion splits into two or more lesions, the 
apparently larger lesion will be reported as a non- index lesion.  
All other smaller lesions will be reported as new non -index 
lesions with an indication that the lesion split from the specified lesion.  In this case, appearance of a new lesion from a previous 
lesion that sp lit will not
 be considered disease progression solely 
due to appearance of a new lesion (may be considered disease 
progression due to > 25% increase in the sum of the products of 
the perpendicular diameters of all index tumors since baseline, or 
the unequi vocal appearance of a new tumor, other than the 
product of the split tumor, since the last response assessment 
time point).

CONFIDENTIAL    Section:  Baseline Documentation of “Index Lesions”:  
 
Add: The sum of the products of the largest perpendicular diameters  of 
all index lesions will be calculated and reported.  
 
If a subject has multiple small superficial cutaneous melanoma 
lesions at baseline ( each lesions is less than [ADDRESS_953537] 2 
dimensions) which in aggregate have a total diameter of ≥ [ADDRESS_953538] lesions that were 
included in this measurement will be reported as ”Index Lesions ”, 
and the sum of the products of the two largest perpendicular 
diameters of these lesions will be calculated and reported for 
tumor response assessments.  
  
Delete:  The sum of the products of the two largest of perpendicular diameters 
(SPD) of all index lesions will be calculated and reported .

Section:  Follow -up “New Lesions”:  
 
Delete:  At each subsequent  tumor assessment , if new measurable lesions 
have appeared they  
  
Add: At tumor assessment , if new measurable lesions have appeared they 
should be added to sum of the products of the two largest 
perpendicular diameters  SPD of the index lesions  to provide the total 
tumor burden.  For nonmeasurable new lesion they should be followed as nonindex lesion as “present”, “absent”, or in rare cases “unequivocal progression”.  If a new lesion(s) that appears in 
between scheduled tumor response assessments disappear(s) before the next scheduled assessment, there is no need to 
include this lesion for tumor response evaluation.

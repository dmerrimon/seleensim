1. Abstract  
Patients with cancer often undergo costly therapy and acute care utilization that is discordant 
with their wishes, particularly at the end of life. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_684683] -concordant practice  in advanced cancer, palliative care referral rates for 
stage IV patients are  low. In this project, we will evaluate a health system initiative that uses 
behavioral nudges to prompt palliative care referral s among outpatients  with advanced cancer in 
terms of successful palliat ive care referrals and downstream quality of life outcomes. In 
partnership with the health system,  this will be conducted as a  2-arm pragmatic  cluster  
randomized trial .  
2. Overall objectives  
The primary  objective  of the study is to evaluate the impact of sending behavioral nudges to 
clinicians , as compared to usual practice, on completion of  palliative care referrals  among 
patients with advanced cancer. Our secondary objectiv es are to identify the impact of prompted 
palliative care referrals on quality of life, acute care utilization, and end -of-life utilization.  
3. Aims  
 3.1 Primary outcome  
The primary outcome of the study is  palliative care visits  
 3.2 Secondary outcome s 
• Change in quality of life between 0 and 9 weeks (as measured by  [CONTACT_598900] –  General ( FACT -G) among patients who receive palliative care compared to 
matched controls)  (Appendix A ) 
• Quality of life at  9 weeks (as measured by [CONTACT_33743] –  
General (FACT -G) among patients who receive palliative care compared to matched controls)  
 3.3 Exploratory  outcome s 
• Unplanned 30-day emergency room and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14285] (among all patients)  
• Metrics of aggressive end -of-life care (systemic therapy  within 14 days before death, no hospi[INVESTIGATOR_684684]; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_24194] <3 days before death)  among decedents  
• Documented advance care planning or serious illness conversations in the outpatient medical 
record  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_684685]  
• Overall survival, defined as date from enrollment to death  
4. Background  
Patients with advanced cancer have poor quality of life and life expectancy.1 Palliative care is a 
medical specialty focusing on providing relief from the symptoms and stress of serious illnesses 
such as cancer.2 While palliative care referrals often occur in the inpatient setting for acutely ill 
individuals3, early outpatient specialty palliative care concurrent with cancer -directed treatment 
improves quality of life and survival, is an evidence -based practice, and is endorsed by [CONTACT_684692].4–8 Palliative care can be provided in the ambulatory, telemedicine, or home -based 
settings.3,6,9,10 However, nearly half of patients with advanced cancer do not receive palliative 
care prior to dying.11,12 Lack of standardized referral criteria and screening methods for palliative 
care contributes to u nderutilization. There is a high need for strategies to increase use of 
palliative care in oncology.13,14 
Clinicians underutilize palliative care, initiating referrals a median of 2 months before death.15 
This status quo bias , which predisposes clinicians to continue current practice even if not the 
optimal option, may lead to delayed or missed palliative care referrals.16 Additionally, optimism 
bias, the cognitive bias that causes clinicians to believe that their own patients are at lesser risk 
of negative outcomes, may cause clinicians to underestimate a patient’s mortality risk or 
symptom burden, thus delayi ng palliative care referral.17 Finally, overconfidence bias,  the 
propensity to overestimate one’s desired behaviors when it is not objectively reasonable, may lead clinicians to incorrectly believe they are initiating more palliative care referrals than their 
peers.
18  
Overcoming suboptimal clinician decision -making biases are key to increasing palliative care 
referrals. Principles from behavioral economics can inform “nudges” that change how clinicians receive information and make choices such as palliative care referral.
[ADDRESS_927727] resistance can mitigate clinicians’  status quo bias .19 
Reframing clinicians’ prognoses by [CONTACT_684693] -driven life expectancy assessments may 
combat optimism bias.17  
Early palliative care  intervention  can improve quality of life for patients with advanced cancer. 
Outpatient palliative care is available at 98% of NCI- designated cancer cen ters and 63% of non-
NCI centers.20 Early outpatient palliative care concurrent with cancer -directed treatment 
improves quality of life, reduces symptom burden, and decreases rates of aggressive end of life 
care.4,5 Nevertheless, only a minority of patients who qualify for palliative care receive it.

5. Study d esign  
 5.1 Design 
This is a 2 -arm pragmatic randomized trial among approximately 250 outpatients with advanced 
cancer to assess response to behavioral nudges to refer to palliative care. The setting will be 
outpatient oncology at the Ann B. Barshinger Cancer Institute at La ncaster General Health. 
Eligible clinicians will be randomized in clusters by [CONTACT_249983][INVESTIGATOR_684688] (pod) to receive default EPIC -based prompts for palliative care referral among advanced cancer patients (Arm 1) 
vs no intervention/usual practice (Arm 2 ). These nudges have been shown to positively influence 
clinician behavior and are often used to drive value -based oncology care; however, they have never 
been studied in the context of palliative care referral. The primary outcome is completion of a palliative care referral within [ADDRESS_927729] basic demog raphic information (age, gender, practice site, and comfort with SICs) 
(Appendix 3).  
  5.2 Study duration  
The study is expected to begin in April  2022 and take 9 months ( 3 months for enrollment + 6 
months total follow  up) to complete. Our analysis will take place from December  2022  to March  
2023.  
 5.3 Target population  
Outpatients  with advanced cancer at the Ann B. Barshinger Cancer Institute at Lancaster General 
Health  who are eligible for palliative care (see below).  
 5.4 Accrual  
Patients will accrue to the trial according to their clinician pod  in advance of a repeat patient 
visit. Any eligible patient cared for by [CONTACT_684694].  
 5.5 Key inclusion criteria 
Patients who meet the following criteria will be eligible for the study.  
• Have a functional telephone number  
• Receive ongoing care from hema tology/oncology services within the Ann B. Barshinger 
Cancer Institute (ABBCI) at Lancaster General Health . 
5.6 Key exclusion criteria   
• Patients appearing for a new patient visit  
• Patients who  have previously received  palliative care  
• Patients who are enroll ed in an ongoing clinical trial  of a therapeutic agent  
• Patients who receive primary oncologic care within another institution  
6. Subject recruitment  
Eligible patients will be identified by a Clinical Research Coordinator in advance of a repeat 
patient visit with an eligible clinician . 
7. Subject compensation 
No compensation will be offered  to clinicians  in the intervention.   
Patients who are administered quality of life surveys  and complete a FACT -G survey at 9 weeks 
or earlier will be offered $[ADDRESS_927730] -G surveys at baseline (prior to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345]) and at 3, 6, 9, and 18 
weeks after enrollment. A copy of the informed consent form is available ( Appendix  B). Those 
who elect not to participate will be asked to grant permission (or not) for the study team to 
collect limited data from them. An abbreviated Study Decline Consent form will be utilized for 
this purpose  (Appendix C ). 
 8.2 Procedures  
Baseline d ata on oncologists  and their patients at Lancaster General Health will be obtained from  
Penn Data Store  and Clarity (Epic’s data reporting database) . Physician data includes 
demographic information ( e.g. sex, type of medical degree, etc.)  and may be also obtained from 
publicly available databases or websites online . Baseline data collected on patients will include 
age, gender, zip code of residence, type of cancer, Elixhauser comorbidity index, ECOG performance status, whether the patient is on active systemic therapy , and understanding of 
palliative care. This will be collected via the electronic health record and an in- person enrollment 
questionnaire  (Appendix D ) upon enrollment into the trial.  Those who elect not to participate , 
but consent to limited data collection, will be asked to fill out a similar questionnaire including reason(s) for not wanting to participate in a de -identified manner (Appendix E ). 
Prior to the trial, staff will randomize each clinician pod in a 1:1 fashion to either intervention or 
usual care. The Principal Investigator (RBP) will be blinded to arm assignment. In both 
intervention and control arms, research coordinator staff will identify patients with advanced 
cancer who are actively cared for within the Ann B. Barshinger  Cancer Institute system. They 
will the n regularly review the electronic health record for eligible clinicians  to identify patients 
with an upcoming repeat patient visit who are eligible for palliative care. Patients who are 
eligible will have a solid malignancy and at least one of the following five conditions: (1) 
Documented  advanced (stage IV) solid malignancy; (2) Known central nervous system 
metastasis, ( 3) Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status > 2, Karnofsky 
Performance Status < 50, ( 4) uncontrolled symptoms such as pain, escalating opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], 
nausea/vomit ing, distress, dyspnea, delirium , or ( 5) hospi[INVESTIGATOR_684689].  
 
For patients whose clinician pods are randomized to the intervention arm, the care team pod will receive an EPIC in -basket message indicating that the patient is eligible for Palliative Care and 
that a default referral order has been pended for that patient. Clinicians  will be given an opportunity 
to respond if they do not want their patient to be referred to palliative care. For clinicians who do 
not respond, after the allotted time, the Clinical Research Coordinator will reach out to the patient 
to introd uce palliative care and ask if ABBCI staff can schedule an appointment. For non- English 
speaking patients, an interpreter will assist research staff. For clinicians who respond no, the 
pended order will be removed and no patient contact [CONTACT_684695].   For eligible patients whose clinician pods  have been randomized to the control  arm, no intervention 
will be provided. Clinicians will refer patients to palliative care based on their usual practice.  
 Among patients in the intervention arm for whom palliative care referral is placed, who  accept for 
a scheduler to call them to make an appointment, a trained research coordinator will approach [ADDRESS_927731] -G survey ( Appendix  A). [ADDRESS_927732] -G survey will be administered prior to discharge  in-person 
via paper or electronically . Surveys will be repeated at 3, 6, 9, and 18- week  intervals by [CONTACT_684696]- person at an in -person visit. For patients that complete the 9 -week  survey  or any 
survey prior , a $[ADDRESS_927733] will be given at the 9 -week time  point . Patients who miss their visits 
with palliative care will be contact[CONTACT_684697] ( Appendix F) and 
reschedule the appointment.  
 
9. Analysis plan  
We will use REDcap , a HIPAA- compliant and secure database tool, to track all components of the 
study. Descriptive statistics will be  used to estimate the frequencies, means, and standard 
deviations of the study variables. Differences between study groups in baseline characteristics and 
clinical outcomes will be  assessed with the use of two -sided Fisher's exact tests and chi -square 
tests for categorical variables and independent -samples Student's t -tests for continuous variables.  
The unit of analysis will be the patient.   The primary study endpoint is a binary patient -level variable indicating completion of a palliative 
care visit within [ADDRESS_927734] of nudges on completion of palliative care consultation for advanced cancer patients. Competing risk caused by [CONTACT_684698] 24 weeks will be considered as censored in the analysis. Covariates 
will include patient and cancer -related variables.  Patients will be followed for 24 weeks or until 
death. Using a longitudinal multilevel mixed -effects model with clustering by [CONTACT_684699] (intraclass correlation coefficient 0.5 based on prior randomized trial); a two -sided type 
I error rate of 0.05; and a baseline palliative care visit rate of 45% (standard deviation 10%), we expect that a sample size of 250 patients will gi ve us 80% power to detect a meaningful 34 
percentage point response in palliative care visits, considering the presence of a competing risk of 6-month mortality at 20%.  
 One secondary outcome  will be (1) change in quality of life between 0 and 9 weeks (as measured 
by [CONTACT_33743] – General (FACT -G) among patients who 
receive palliative care compared to matched controls . Multivariate linear  regression analyses, 
adjusted for baseline scores, will be used to examine the effect of palliative care on completion of 
palliative care consultation for advance cancer patients. For intention -to-treat analyses, we will use 
the conservative method of carryi ng the most recent  quality- of-life values forward to account for 
all missing data, including data that are  missing owing to death. 
 Other secondary outcome s will include (1) change in quality of life between 0 and 18 weeks (as 
measured by [CONTACT_33743] – General (FACT -G) among patients 
who receive palliative care compared to matched controls; (2) unplanned 30- day emergency room 
and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14285] (among all patients); (3) metrics of aggressive end -of-life care among 
decedents (chemotherapy within 14 days before death, no hospi[INVESTIGATOR_684690]; 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_24194] <3 days before death); (4) documented advance care planning or serious illness conversations in the outpatient medical record.  
 For the exploratory outcome of overall survival, survival time will be calculated from the date of enrollment to the date of death with the use of the Kaplan–Meier method. Data from patients who are alive at the last follow -up will be censored on that date . A Cox proportional -hazards model 
will be used to assess the effect of triggered palliative care on survival, with adjustment for baseline covariates.

11. Human research protection  
 11.[ADDRESS_927735] confidentiality  
Data on physicians and patients  will be ob tained from Epic, Penn Data Store  and chart review . 
Any information that is obtained will be used only for research purposes and to inform the 
behavioral nudges described above .  Information on individual patients will only be disclosed 
within the study team . All study staff will be reminded of  the confidential nature of the data 
collected and contai ned in these databases.  
Data regarding provider performance of palliative care referral  are already shared among  the 
health system and some  providers and will continue to be shared as pa rt of the trial. General 
panel -level statistics regarding acute care utilization at the end of life  provider’s deceased patient 
panel will be shared to outpatient providers  as part of the intervention but is planned to occur 
regardless of trial approval  as part of quality improvement efforts . 
Data will be stored, managed, and analyzed on a secure, encrypted server behind the University 
of Pennsylvania Health System (UPHS) firewall. The primary investigator ([CONTACT_684704] ) and 
statistical analyst will be blinded to the randomization schema and which groups are receiving the intervention. All study personnel that will use this data are listed on the IRB application and 
have completed training in HIPAA standards and the CITI human subjects research. Data access 
will be password protected. Whenever pos sible, data will be de- identified for analysis.  
 11.[ADDRESS_927736] of care.  
11.6 Risk/benefit  
  11.6.1 Potential study risks  
The potential risks associated with this study are minimal .  Breach of data is a potential risk that 
will be mitigated by [CONTACT_684700] s (name [CONTACT_684702] w/ MAs ) and evaluation 
(PMACS server ). As noted above, substantial data demonstrates that palliative care  referrals 
improve patient goal -concordant care without any identified harms  (despi[INVESTIGATOR_684691], the opposite has been found) , so the negative 
impact on patie nts is minimal. The FACT -G survey has been used in many trials measuring 
quality of life for patients with advanced cancer and no detrimental effect on patient well -being 
has ever been found.  
  11.6.[ADDRESS_927737] improved quality of life and better goal -
concordant care when exposed to palliative care , especially earlier in their disease course. An 
intervention that prompts providers to refer to palliative care for patients with advanced cancer  
may increase the likelihood that  patients get seen by [CONTACT_684701]. However, i t is possible that 
patients will receive no benefit from this study.  
  11.6.3 Risk/benefit assessment  
The risk/benefit ratio is highly favorable given the potential benefit from eligible patients  having 
a palliative care consultation  benefitting from better goal -concordant care and that efforts have 
been put into place to minimize the risk of breach of data.

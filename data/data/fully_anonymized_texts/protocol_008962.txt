Background, Rationale  and Context  
 
Postoperative death within [ADDRESS_242668] common cause of mortality in this country.(1) 
The general care floor or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_203459] a place for recovery of postoperative patients who are clinically stable and will transition quickly to leave the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. However, about half of all adverse events in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_203460] (2 -4). Cardiac and respi[INVESTIGATOR_203461]. (5) A majority of these acute cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_203462]. Up to 60% of patients have at least one or more abnormal vital signs starting about [ADDRESS_242669]. (4)  Early detection of this change in patient physiology therefore becomes 
critical in effective upstream preventative and therapeutic measures which can translate into improved downstream clinical outcomes. Whereas most patients are still being monitored on an intermittent ‘spot check’ 
basis on hospi[INVESTIGATOR_173967], the evolving role of continuous portable monitoring systems is of obvious benefit in 
these clinical settings.  
At Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center, continuous monitoring of vital signs is as yet not a gold standard of care and is limited to certain units. Most patient assessments are still performed on an intermittent basis  with every [ADDRESS_242670] continuous portable monitoring (ViSi device, Sotera Wireless, San Diego, CA) that has been installed 
in a phased manner for the last [ADDRESS_242671]. Daniel I. Sessler (co -mentor) showed that ward hypoxemia is 
common, prolonged and profound in both severity  and duration. 21% of postope rative  non- cardiac inpatients were  
found to have ≥10 minutes SpO
2 < 90% per hour in patients with clinician -blinded monitoring11. More than 90% 
of desaturation  epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841] (<90% for a continuous hour) were missed using routine measurements at [ADDRESS_242672] risk  for hypoxemia after surgery,  may be those  with obstructive sleep  apnea and 
those on narcotic  medication  for analgesia or a combination of these. The STOP -BANG scoring system is a 
validated and easy to use mechanism for screening for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).[ADDRESS_242673] (with continuous blinded pulse  oximetry)  for 
at least 48 postoperative  hours, but rather surprisingly found no association  between an increasing STOP -BANG 
score and postoperative hypoxemia.
13 There was also no relationship between the type of narcotic used in a 
patient controlled analgesia system (IV hydromorphone and morphine compared with IV fentanyl) and postoperative hypoxemia.
14These results  highlighted the fact that respi[INVESTIGATOR_203463] -Postop Ward_  
  Ver 0 7/05/[ADDRESS_242674] already 
been published in the Lancet,9NEJM,10 JAMA,16 and Anesthesiology.8,17,18 These studies show that hypotension 
on surgical wards  is common and prolonged; that both intraoperative and ward  hypotension are strongly associated  
with myocardial injury  and death;  that postoperative myocardial infarctions are far more common that generally 
appreciated and have a 10% 30-day mortality. [CONTACT_203512] was previously involved in a trial of portable 
continuous monitoring that showed at least 10% of all hospi[INVESTIGATOR_203464] 15 continuous minutes or more 
of mean arterial pressures less than 65mmHg over a 48 -hour monitoring period. Importantly,  nurse  initiated  spot 
checks missed  detection of hypotension in 50% of these  patients.  19 A recent  analysis of  the PeriOperative ISchemic  
Evaluation-2 Trial (POISE-2) data showed that exposure to systolic blood pressure less than 90mmHg (as detected  
using routine  nursing evaluation), occurred in 42% of postoperative ward  patients and was associated with a nearly 
3-fold increase in the odds of mortality.18 Intraoperative tachycardia is also common to the tune of 71% for a 
HR>90/min.20 [CONTACT_203512] recently finished PRediction of Opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]-induced respi[INVESTIGATOR_203465] (PRODIGY),  a prospective, observational study of continuous bedside capnography

(rORADE). One or more respi[INVESTIGATOR_203470] 615 (46%) of 1,336 patients over 24 hr (manuscript accepted for publication in Anesthesia & Analgesia). Separate work has shown that half of all closed claims for  postoperative respi[INVESTIGATOR_203471] a quarter caused  serious neurologic injury.  
Almost all these events were deemed preventable with a better monitoring and response system.

It is thus apparent  that postoperative cardio -respi[INVESTIGATOR_203472].  It seems  
highly likely that only continuous hemodynamic/saturation/ventilation monitoring will detect and prevent cardio-

large constituency in the health care system —the National Center for Health Statistics estimated a total of 34.7 
million discharges in 2005. Accordingly, much effort  has historically  been  expended to keep  these  patients  safe 
during their stay. In its 2001 report  the Institute  of Medicine identified failure to rescue —as hospi[INVESTIGATOR_203475] -surgical complications —as a primary patient safety target. The 
Anesthesia Patient Safety Foundation (APSF) has recently focused significant attention at education and awareness to patient deterioration in the peri surgical period and themed their annual meeting in 2019 as “Perioperative Deterioration: Early Recognition, Rapid Intervention, and the End of Failure to Rescue”  
Significance for Bioinformatics, Implementation Science & Innovation for the Future Continuous postoperative monitoring and associated nursing alerts may help detect cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_203476], and in so doing, result in more rapid  initiation  of correct  treatment responses  and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_203477].  
These will also generate  many thousands of data points which will be connected to patient level data in the

  ViSi monitoring -Postop Ward_  
  Ver 0 7/05/[ADDRESS_242676] in adoption of portable monitoring technology (ViSi device, Sotera Wireless, San Diego, CA) that has been installed in a phased manner for the last [ADDRESS_242677] level of nursing response (graded on an ordinal scale) to unblinded (available to healthcare providers) monitor generated alarms in response to hypotension, tachycardia or hypoxemia. Myocardial injury after non- cardiac surgery (MINS) is defined by [CONTACT_203501]. It is a leading cause of postoperative 
mortality, with about 20% of all deaths being secondary to MINS.(6) About 80% of postoperative myocardial 
injury is clinically silent, detected only by [CONTACT_203502]. MINS is strongly associated with both intraoperative 
(7, 8)  and postoperative hypotension.(9, 10)  However, nearly all MINS occurs during the initial three postoperative 
days suggesting that postoperative hypotension may be a major cause. As an exploratory outcome we will investigate whether the availability of continuous monitoring and interventions to reduce hypotension would decrease MINS. Assuming positive results, data from this pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] (N= 500 exposed to each of unblinded and blinded 
monitoring)  trial will form the basis for a large randomized trial of ward monitoring assessing “hard” outcomes 
such as myocardial injury, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399], and death. In this context, unblinded monitoring will be continuous vital signs available at all times to healthcare providers, whereas blinded monitoring would be silenced monitoring with bedside providers having no access to continuous vital signs or associated alarms.  Standard of care monitoring (every 4 hours vital signs checks) will be used as the comparator and will be available in blinded arm. 
Fail-safe alarms set at extreme limits will also be available in the blinded arm.  
Specific Aim 1, primary : Determine whether continuous unblinded (vs. blinded) monitoring and nursing alerts 
reduce the duration of hypotension, tachycardia, or hypoxemia over the first 48 hours after surgery, without 
substantially increasing the duration of any of the 3 outcomes (i.e., noninferior on all, superior on at least one) Hypothesis 1 : Continuous unblinded postoperative blood pressure, heart rate, and saturation monitoring with 
associated nursing alerts and management strategies reduces the duration of hypotension (MAP <65 mmHg) and/or tachycardia (>90 beats/min) and/or desaturation (SpO2<90%). Specific Aim 2, secondary : Assess the effect of 
unblinded versus blinded continuous postoperative monitoring on the fraction of patients in which a clinical intervention is triggered due to hypotension (MAP <65 mmHg), tachycardia (>90 beats/min) or desaturation (SpO2<90%). Clinical nursing intervention responses over the duration of the trial will be categorized as (1) none, 
(2) independent nursing intervention, (3) notification of physician team, or (4) activation of the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_203482]. These will also serve as surrogate markers of alarm fatigue for the bedside nurses. We will have at least two independent evaluators adjudicate monitor data and electronic medical records during the alarm period to define which of hypotension, tachycardia or hypoxemia was the primary trigger for each response. 
The main secondary outcome will be summarized for a patient as the worst clinical nursing intervention response 
among hypotension, tachycardia and desaturation, on the above ordinal scale.     Hypothesis 2 : Increasing bedside 
clinical nursing interventions (ranging from no response, to activation of the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_203483]) are more 
common in patients randomized to unblinded monitoring and associated nursing alerts.  Specific Aim 3, 
exploratory : Assess the effect of unblinded versus blinded continuous postoperative monitoring on the incidence 
  ViSi monitoring -Postop Ward_  
  Ver 0 7/05/2021   
 
of myocardial injury after non -cardiac surgery (MINS). Hypothesis 3 : MINS is less common when continuous 
hemodynamic monitoring is available to clinicians.   
 
Methods and Measures  
Participant selection: We will include surgical inpatients (transferred to pre -designated war ds) ≥65 years or  
≥[ADDRESS_242678] one cardiovascular  risk factor  (e.g. hypertension, diabetes)  having noncardiac surgery  
who require  a general  or regional anesthesia and at least a [ADDRESS_242679]. The risks of the proposed study are 
minimal since no patient will be denied routine monitoring and treatment as per institutional guidelines. 
Protocol: Two wards at Wake Forest Baptist will be enrolled in a prospective ward - cluster randomized (to one 
of the two sequences) alternating cohort study,27,[ADDRESS_242680]  
monitoring with alarms silenced and screens covered (blinded) , or to continuous monitoring accessible  to 
clinicians (unblinded) with pre -specified alerts at MAP <65 mmHg, heart rate >90 b/m, and SpO 2 <90%. Of 
note, to ensure patient safety and no risk in either arm, factory alarm limits (see table under human subjects 
protection) at extremes of physiological vital signs will stay on in the blinded/silenced arm, and both arms will 
have every [ADDRESS_242681] mounted (Sotera wireless, San 
Diego, CA) continuous ambulatory monitoring system functions throughout Wake Forest Baptist Health, and health care providers are very familiar with its use and interpretation of data. We  will educate & collaborate with 
all of the relevant  nursing teams,  surgeons, resident doctors, and the Emergency  Medical Response Team, 
regarding the trial protocol and expected responses. Attractive features of this study design include its ability  to 
(i) be easily  implemented  within  wards,  as ward  personnel won’t have to keep  track  of subsets assigned  to 
blinded and  unblinded, (ii) protect against the Hawthorne effect,  as each ward  will be similarly  exposed to 
unblinded monitoring,
29(iii) account  for within -ward  trends over time,  e.g., personnel or procedure changes,  as 
each ward  will have similar  amounts of exposure to unblinded monitoring, equally distributed over the course of 
a calendar year, and finally (iv) prevent contamination within ward as each patient will be only surrounded by 
[CONTACT_203503].

Measurements: ViSi continuous monitoring will start on ward admission and continue until the 3rd 
postoperative morning or 48 continuous hours (whichever comes  earlier)  while  patients  remain  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057]. The 
ViSi monitoring  system is wrist- mounted and battery powered; it communicates via secure Wi -Fi. Values and 
alerts (in unblinded patients) will display on individual monitors and on each nursing station. For blinded 
patients, nursing station screens will be turned off, and alarms disabled, except  for fail-safe alarms at extreme 
limits  and technical  alerts. (specific aim 1) To ensure patient safety,  all patients will also have routine 
intermittent nurse monitoring and any clinically appropriate  interventions.  Details of interventions in response 
to unblinded alarms will be obtained from the electronic medical record and grouped on the pre -specified

Hypothesis 1 : Continuous unblinded postoperative blood pressure, heart rate, and saturation monitoring 
with associated nursing alerts and management strategies reduces the duration of hypotension (MAP <65 mmHg) and/or tachycardia (> 110 beats/min) and/or desaturation (SpO2<90%). Specific Aim 2, secondary :

no evidence of a non- ischemic etiology. (11)  
Hypothesis 3 : MINS is less common when continuous hemodynamic monitoring is available to clinicians  
and appropriate interventions are made in response to hypotension detected by [CONTACT_63931]. 
 
Ancillary outcomes : At the end of the study period and prior to discharge from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], all included 
patients will be provided a research information document. This will include (via a link to a REDCap anonymous survey) a post study satisfaction questionnaire that will collect useful data on the patient’s perception of continuous monitoring and the comfort/discomfort with the devices used in each arm. This data will only be used with descriptive statistics and will be used to gain useful insight into the need for surveillance monitoring on hospi[INVESTIGATOR_173967].  
The following questions will be included in the post study survey questionnaire:  On a scale of 1-5 ( 1 = disagree 2 = somewhat disagree 3= neutral 4= somewhat agree and 5=agree), please rate your experience with vital signs checks during your hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]  1. Were continuous vital signs monitoring using a monitoring device important to you?  
2. Was intermittent nursing checks (provider in the room) to check on your vital signs important to you?  
3. Was the type of devices that were used to monitor your vital signs important to you? 
4. Were you inconvenienced with the portable monitoring device on your wrist? 
5. Were you inconvenienced with the intermittent nursing checks (provider in the room) to check on your vital signs? 
6. Did alarms inconvenience you?  
7. Would you feel safer with a continuous monitoring device strapped to you all the time while you recover in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]?  
8. Is the size of the continuous monitoring device important for you?  
9. Is the ability to ambulate/walk around freely while being monitored important for you?  
10. Would it be a good idea to continue to monitor your vital signs remotely even after you go home?  
 
        Analytical Plan  
Both ward and individual level data will be collected for statistical analysis. The two wards will be 
compared on baseline characteristics using descriptive statistics. Variables with an absolute standardized

difference > 0.[ADDRESS_242690] monitoring. Missing data as 
well as the reason for missing will be summarized. Our modeling framework (generalized linear mixed effects modeling) makes the same assumptions about missing data as multiple imputation.  
Data Storage Sotera is responsible for the ViSi monitoring data, which will be stored in the Sotera cloud -
based database.  This data set will contain device IDs, along  with dates,  to be merged  to EPIC  charts  
collected  here at Wake  Forest School  of Medicine.  We have easily  pi[INVESTIGATOR_203487] [ADDRESS_242691]  
Center  for Biomedical  Informatics  will provide expertise on data collection  and storage.  
Sample  size and power:  As is standard  in the clustered  study design literature,  
30we will perform a power 
calculation that  (i) assumes individual- level  randomization  and then (ii) adjusts for cluster -level  correlation,  
as study participants  cannot be viewed as statistically independent within a cluster and are not actually 
individually randomized. Presumably, for Aim [ADDRESS_242692] observed that median [quartiles] minutes under MAP of 65 mmHg of 6 [0, 19] or 
higher for noncardiac patients who suffer AKI and MI. In our power calculation to follow, we assume 
that the unblinded patients will have approximately mean 7.3 minutes exposed to MAP <[ADDRESS_242693] mean  13 minutes  exposed  to MAP  <[ADDRESS_242694] 100% power to reject the null hypothesis that the exposed time to MAP <[ADDRESS_242695] 80% power in an individually randomized study for sample sizes as low as [ADDRESS_242696],  D
eff = 1+(m-1)*ICC, where  m is the number of patients  per ward  in a given month  and ICC ∈ [0, 1] 
is the correlation of patients within a ward. The figure below displays how sample size to achieve 80% 
statistical power for our anticipated effect size will inflate as a function of increasing  ICC.

on the cumulative duration (min/hour) of each of hypotension, tachycardia, and desaturation using negative binomial regression, within a generalized linear mixed effects modeling framework (to adjust for correlation of participants within ward with a random effect for ward). Individuals exposed to unblinded versus blinded monitoring will be compared on the number of minutes less than each threshold (i.e., a count outcome), considering the total 
number of minutes observed for the patient as an offset.   Treatment effects will be reported as 
the estimated incidence rate ratio of unblinded to blinded and confidence interval separately for 
hypotension, tachycardia, and hypoxia. A rate ratio less than [ADDRESS_242705] of unblinded monitoring on the outcome, i.e., participants are less likely to be exposed to harmful conditions, e.g., MAP<65, in the presence of unblinded monitoring.  
Aim 2. We will assess the effect of continuous monitoring and associated alerts on the ordinal 
clinical intervention outcome which measures the single most extreme/elevated clinical 
intervention incurred by a patient for any of the [ADDRESS_242706] (hypotension, 
tachycardia, hypoxia) during the study period, summarized on an ordinal scale as (1) none, (2) independent nursing intervention, (3) notification of physician team, or (4) activation of the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_203488] (with a random effect for ward) and expressing the treatment effect as the odds ratio and confidence 
interval for having a more extreme/elevated clinical intervention in the unblinded versus 
blinded monitoring. As in Aim 1, an odds ratio less than [ADDRESS_242707] on MINS (yes/no) during the 
study period using logistic regression with a random effect for ward. Results for Aims [ADDRESS_242708] size of a 5.7-minute difference between treatment groups in terms of time exposed to MAP < 65mmHG (assuming an equal standard deviation of 13 minutes exposed for each group). We calculated our sample size projections to have 80% power with a 5% type-I error rate. In our calculations, we recognized there currently exists a degree of uncertainty regarding intra -ward correlation (ICC), the degree 
of which has implications on our necessary sa mple size. As ICC increases, our required sample 
size to achieve 80% power increases. To address this uncertainty, we propose conducting an interim analysis at 6 -months to assess the estimated ICC of our population, from which we can 
  ViSi monitoring -Postop Ward_  
  Ver 0 7/05/[ADDRESS_242709] our period of accrual accordingly to ensure adequate power without unnecessary (i.e. 
prolonged) recruitment. In this interim analysis, we will not evaluate our primary hypothesis assessing a difference between groups with respect to our primary outcomes. Therefore, we do not propose amending our primary statistical analysis plan to account for multiple looks.  
At [ADDRESS_242710] accrued approximately 250 patients. The decision rules based on our interim assessment of ICC are as follows:  
- If the ICC is sufficiently low enough to have achieved ≥80% power given our existing 
sample size at the time of the interim analysis, we will conclude accrual at the end of the current (ongoing) 4-week phase of the study. Given the timeline of the study, this would mean our interim analysis of ICC would be conducted at week 26 of the study, and thus the study would conclude after week 29 (the 4th week of the study phase accruing over weeks 26-29).  - If the estimated ICC is higher than what would yield ≥ 80% power at the time of the interim 
assessment, but less than our maximum assumed possible ICC of 0.[ADDRESS_242711] to meet our necessary sample size.  - If the estimated ICC > 0.12, thus requiring > 52 weeks of accrual, we will estimate the 
amount of additional time necessary to reach our required sample size, beyond our initially proposed 52 weeks. Our decisions to continue or stop the study due to futility will be made based on funds and time available.  
Approach To Potential  Limitations  
(i)Although the ViSi monitor  is lightweight and battery  powered, patients  may refuse  to be 
tethered  to wear  the system  for 48 hours. We are currently using this monitor, with good 
patient cooperation; specifically, we have been able to obtain reliable near -continuous 
recordings in postoperative patients over several postoperative days. The ViSi Mobile 
technology is cleared by [CONTACT_203505] ±8 mmHg (SD) against a radial 
arterial catheter.  
(ii) Continuous monitoring may detect more hemodynamic and respi[INVESTIGATOR_203489]- hour intervals. This per se may not prompt nurses and 
clinicians to intervene — much less that the interventions will prove effective. We will provide  
a broad framework  of suggested  interventions,  none of which  would be binding. We will also 
evaluate the frequency and nature of interventions. Since,  alarm  fatigue from  the continuously 
generated  alarms (some  of which  may be false)  may be common, we propose to categorize 
nursing responses on an incremental scale from 1 -4. From these data, it will be apparent 
whether nurses responded quickly to the alarms, and with reasonable interventions either themselves or from the physician alerted, or via rapid response team intervention. This data will also over the time course of the study tell us an estimate of alarm fatigue.  (iii) In addition, our primary outcome characterizes important mechanisms by [CONTACT_203506]-cardiac surgery (MINS) and serious respi[INVESTIGATOR_2340]. This study will be underpowered 
for an exploratory  outcome of MINS,  but the pi[INVESTIGATOR_203490] R01 which will be a much larger trial.

study satisfaction questionnaire that will collect useful data on the patient’s perception of continuous monitoring and the comfort/discomfort with the devices used in each arm.   (See 
questions and details under ancillary outcomes – under specific outcomes)   
 
Safety considerations 
As previously specified, this study poses minimal risk in either of the randomized clusters. Both the randomized clusters will continue to receive at least every four hourly vital signs checks, which is current standard of care across the nation. Both arms (including the blinded arm) will always have factory alarm limits (as specified in the table below) always switched on, so no critical event is missed on any patient (no matter what cluster that patient is part of). Therefore though one cluster of patients will have continuous monitoring silenced and blinded, extreme alarms limits will always be available and standard of care intermittent monitoring will also always be available on these patients.

Mentorship  and role of other key investigators :  [CONTACT_203513] will oversee all aspects of the 
study including IRB approval, pre-study education and orientation  of nursing and research 
teams, patient recruitment, enrollment, monitoring, and data analysis. [CONTACT_203512] will 
collaborate with the monitoring device manufacturers (Sotera wireless) to ensure quality of data collection. [CONTACT_203514] (professor and chair biostatics and public health 
sciences) initially supervised the  creation  of trial statistical methodology and will mentor [CONTACT_203515] during data analysis and for the construct of a robust plan for analysis on a follow up 
grant mechanism.  Drs. Eric Kirkendall (chief for the center for healthcare innovation) , [CONTACT_203516] (director for the center for biomedical informatics), and [CONTACT_203517]  (professor & 
chair, department of outcomes research at Cleveland Clinic) will guide  [CONTACT_203512] in development of a 
best mechanistic process for data collection, and interpretation/presentation of the results, and will provide direct mentorship for the proposed R01. Given their expertise in clinical informatics and innovation, Drs. Kirkendall and Wells, are  well positioned to assist [CONTACT_203515] with testing of the data set, (including future device/technology innovations and utilization for predictive analytics) as well as troubleshooting any issues that may arise with the current implementation of this monitoring technology. The entire mentoring team will also participate and guide [CONTACT_203512] in data analysis, interpretation, dissemination (abstract and manuscript review), and NIH R01 application preparedness.  
In addition, this study is appropriately supported by [CONTACT_203507], including the CNO [CONTACT_203518], Director of Nursing Research , [CONTACT_203519], 
Nursing Informatics , Ann Faris & Robin Hack, amongst others. Physician leaders include [CONTACT_203520], Professor of Anesthesiology, who has champi[INVESTIGATOR_203492] [ADDRESS_242714](s). Chad Miller and Clark Files. Furthermore, additional support with data analysis is also being provided by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Joseph Rigdon from the School of Public Health Sciences. Research support is also 
provided by [CONTACT_203508], including data handling support by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Amit 
Saha (departmental data scientist)  and by [CONTACT_203509] 6- 8 research 
assistants, each of whom will be appropriately trained prior to be being introduced into the trial.  
 
Reporting of Unanticipated Problems, Adverse Events or Deviations 
Any unanticipated problems, serious and unexpected adverse events, deviations or protocol changes will be promptly reported  by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_203493].  
 SUBSTUDY In an effort to determine the nursing perceptions of the benefits and failures of continuous hemodynamic monitoring systems as well as the value of these devices in the care of their patients, we propose a sub -study to evaluate on both of the stated research units ([ADDRESS_242715] 
and 10 Reynolds Tower) and the non-research units who have continuous hemodynamic monitoring utilizing the ViSi monitoring system.  These surveys are identical, will be anonymous and unidentifiable, and will be distributed manually by [CONTACT_203510] -Postop Ward_  
  Ver 0 7/05/[ADDRESS_242716] responses.  Information to be collected include the 
following types of information:  the importance of continuous monitoring important to nursing practice and to the safety of their patients, perceptions of increased workload based on the alerts received, accuracy in alerting to patient deterioration, appropriateness of the alarm limits, alarms that cause the most concern when received, and how the nurse perceives the ease of use and confidence in the ViSi monitoring system.  We are capturing the role of the nursing staff on that unit, unit worked on and number of years in practice. We feel the information received on the conduct of this survey will provide feedback to the clinical research team and the clinical practice team practitioners with much needed information in order to see and identify barriers to the implementation of safe and effective continuous 
monitoring systems throughout the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. This is specifically important because the successful use of a continuous monitoring system and associated alarms is dependent on the actual response to alarms with actions that prevent harm from happening or further escalating.   We are asking for a waiver of informed consent for this survey distribution.  A waiver of signed consent is being asked.  The survey questions are evaluating nurses experiences pertaining to 
their positions. Information concerning the purpose of the surveys and assurance of confidentiality and no retaliation for responses. No signature [CONTACT_203511] a breach of confidentiality.

It has been suggested  that ‘attractive ’ individuals  receive  better  judgments  and treatments4 
whereas  those  deemed  ‘unattractive ’ generally  seem  to elicit  negative  responses5. Various clinical 
studies have also linked aesthetic enhancements, through surgical or non -surgical 
procedures,  with improved  projected  first impressions6-8. Remarkably,  the self-perception  of 
physical  appearances  also seems  to affect the development  of inherent  personality.  It has been 
elucidated that self -dissatisfaction due to craniofacial abnormalities can elicit low self -esteem5 
while non-surgical  aesthetic  enhancements  may improve  self-esteem  and lead to a better  quality 
of life9. Thus, improvements  of physical  appearances  can create  a better  projected  first 
impression  as well as a better  self-satisfaction.  
 
In the past decade,  dermal  fillers have become  one of the most popular  minimally  invasive 
treatments for rejuvenation and body sculpturing. According to the American Society of Plastic 
Surgeons,  over 1.[ADDRESS_323029]® Silk (Galderma Laboratories, L.P.) is a hyaluronic acid injectable filler, which is 
approved by [CONTACT_265633].  The goal of this study  is to determine  if lip rejuvenation  of 
patients  with mild to severe  oral commissures  or none to severe  perioral  lines using Restylane® 
Silk would  lead to an improved  projected  first impression  and self-perception  of mood.  
 
[ADDRESS_323030]® Silk 
results  in an improved  projected  first impression  as well as an improved  self-perception  of 
mood.  
 
The secondary objective is to evaluate aesthetic improvements after lip rejuvenation treatment  
with Restylane® Silk and assess  relations  to any alternations  in the projected  first impression  
Silk-FI-[ADDRESS_323031]® Silk on the projected first impression and the self -perception of mood.  
 
[ADDRESS_323032] 21 years of age, who display  mild to severe  oral commissures  or none to 
severe  perioral  lines, as judged  by [CONTACT_45822]  (PI) utilizing  the Oral 
Commissure Severity  Scale (OCSS,  Appendix  G) or the Perioral  Lines Severity  Scale 
(POLSS,  Appendix  H), will be  enrolled.  
 
The study is composed  of up to [ADDRESS_323033]-visit  evaluation  of patients’ 
photographs  by [CONTACT_265634].  A schematic  of the study design  is presented  in Appendix  A. 
 
All subjects  who meet the specified  criteria,  listed in Section  7, will complete  the Subjective 
Happi[INVESTIGATOR_9395]11,12 (SHS,  Appendix  B) and the Happi[INVESTIGATOR_265604]13 (HM, 
Appendix  C) prior to receiving  any treatments.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_265605]’  oral 
commissures  and/or  the perioral  lines using the OCSS  and/or  the POLSS  respectively.  
Furthermore, all subjects undergo photo - and videography, as described in Appendix I, prior to 
treatment.  
 
Subjects  will then be injected  with Restylane® Silk with a volume  sufficient  to achieve  Optimal 
Cosmetic  Results  (OCR),  per treating  investigator’s  discretion  but not to exceed  a total  of 4 ml (4 syringes).  
Subjects  will be assessed  14 ± 3 days after injection  for achieving  the OCR. If OCR has  not 
been reached,  as judged  by [CONTACT_978], a second,  ‘touch-up,’ injection  of Restylane® Silk will be 
performed.  
 
The final evaluation  of subjects  will take place 14 ± 3 days after achieving  OCR. Hence,  this 
would  be 14 ± [ADDRESS_323034] injection  for those who achieved  OCR with one treatment  
but 28  ± [ADDRESS_323035] injection  for those who required  a ‘touch-up’ injection . Subjects  will 
complete  the SHS and HM questionnaires  as well as self-report  any aesthetic  alterations 
experienced  using the Global  Aesthetic  Improvement  Scale (GAIS,  Appendix  D). They will 
also undergo  photo - and videography,  as described  in Appendix  I. Furthermore,  the PI [INVESTIGATOR_265606] (Appendix  E) as well as on the OCSS  and the POLSS.  
 
Photographs  taken at pre-treatment  and 14-Day Post-OCR will be randomly  divided  into [ADDRESS_323036] Impressions  Questionnaire  (FIQ, Appendix  F) to rate 
each photograph.  
 
[ADDRESS_323037] meet the following inclusion criteria:  
 
1. Subject  is an adult of at least 21 years of age; 
2. Subject  has mild to severe  oral commissures  or none to severe  perioral  lines, as 
assessed by [CONTACT_209859];  
3. Subject  is willing  and able to provide  written  informed  consent  prior to the 
performance of any study  related  procedure;  
4. Subject  is willing  and able to comply  with the protocol  requirements;  and 
5. Subject  is willing  and able to provide  written  photo consent  and adhere  to 
the photography  and video procedures  such as removal  of jewelry  and

   Restylane® Silk is administered  using a thin gauge  needle  (30 G x ½) or a 22 gauge 
cannula.  The needle  is inserted  at an approximate  angle of 30° parallel  to the length  of 
the wrinkle,  fold, or lip. For rhytids,  Restylane® Silk is injected  into the mid-to-deep 
dermis.  
   A maximum  dose of 4.[ADDRESS_323042]® Silk may be injected  by a number  of different  techniques  depending  on the treating 
physician’s  experience  and preference  as well as the specific  characteristics  and needs  of each patient 
(Restylane® Silk Package Insert14). The appropriate injection method will be employed per 
treating investigator’s  discretion.

13.3  Serious  Adverse  Events  and Unanticipated  Adverse  Device  Effects  
13.3.1  Definition  
Serious  Adverse  Events  (SAEs)  are defined  as undesirable  events  experienced  by a subject  
that suggest a significant hazard, contraindication, side effect, or precaution, whether or 
not considered  to be device -related  by [CONTACT_737].  An AE is defined  as being serious  
if: 
 
1. It is fatal or life threatening  (life threatening  means  that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_265614], the subject  was at immediate  risk of death  from the adverse  
reaction)  
2. It is permanently  or temporarily  disabling  
3. It requires  inpatient  or prolonged  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
4. Is a congenital anomaly/birth  defect  
 
An unanticipated  adverse  device  effect is defined  as any serious  adverse  effect on health  or 
safety, any life threatening problem, or death that was not previously identified in nature, 
severity, or degree of incidence in t he investigational plan or application (including a 
supplementary  plan or application),  or any other unanticipated  serious  problem  associated  with a 
device  that relate  to the rights,  safety,  or welfare  of subjects.  
13.3.2  Serious  Adverse  Events  Recording  and Reporting

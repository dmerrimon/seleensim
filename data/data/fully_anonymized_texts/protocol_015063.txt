(section 5.2.7 ). 
9. Evaluation of disease ( EOD ): enlarging the time -
window  allowed for imaging at screening to 3 weeks 
(instead of 2 weeks) prior  to enrolment  (D-13); and 
ongoing study imaging will be performed at the end 
of cycle 3 (63 days ± 7 days) instead of at the end of 
cycle 2, and every 9 weeks thereafter. A 
recommendation was also added to proceed 1-2 
additional treatment cycle(s) of NAP/docetaxel 
beyond progression in patients who demonstrate 
objective progression but who are clinically stable, at 
the discretion of the Investigator, followed by a 
confirmat ory imaging after 4 -8 weeks.  
10. Clarifications on the time to perform ECG, vital signs, 
PK and cytokines sampling (post NAP administration 
start time ) in Schedule of Assessment (Section 6)  and 
the Assessment (Section 7) sections . 
11. Correction of a discrepancy in the schedule of the B -
cell test between the Schedule of Assessment (Section

20. A typo graphical error  in the amount of WFI in the 
synopsis has been corrected.  
21. A clarification on the pre -medications administered 
prior to obinutuzumab infusion and time of 
administration , in section 5.3. 3. 
22. Added note to the table of assessments to follow the 
pre-medication guidelines for each of the study

Amendment 6, 
version 7.0 + 
7.1 (correction 
of a 
discrepancy in 
ECG updated 
time points , 
section 7.2.4 ) 17-Jul-[ADDRESS_158840] the reduction in percentage (by 
~25%) rather than in fixed increments.   
NAP may be reduced by [CONTACT_140026] G3 AEs, 
and by [CONTACT_140027] G4, life -threatening AEs 
(with the exception of hematologic toxicity and 
laboratory findings) . A second dose reduction is 
allowed for G3 AEs.    If the dose was reduced only 
once for a G3 AE (e.g., from 10 µg/kg/d ay to 5 
µg/kg/d ay) and is tolerated well with no recurrences 
or further NAP related AEs at the reduced dose, then 
at the PI [INVESTIGATOR_9106], the dose may be increased by [CONTACT_140028].   
2. A clarification was added regarding a delay of a cycle 
due to docetaxel toxicity in section 5.1.2.   If NAP and 
docetaxel are to be delayed due to toxicity of 
docetaxel, the whole cycle of NAP and docetaxel may 
be delayed up to 6 weeks. Further delays should be 
discussed with the Medical Monitor.

archival or fresh biopsies is mandatory  to support the  
retrospective  analysis of 5T4 level.  
4. The efficacy evaluation has been changed from 
RECIST to iRECIST due to the immune mediated 
mechanism of action  of NAP (section 14.1 and 
throughout the protocol) . Support ing this change, is a 
case of pseudo -progression that followed by a 
response . 
5. The schedule of disease assessment by [CONTACT_140029]:  
Ongoing study imaging will be performed at the end 
of cycle 2 (45 ± 7 days) and every 6 weeks (± 7 days) 
for the first 24 weeks and then  every 9 weeks (± 7 
days)  thereafter . This schedule should be maintained  
even if cycles are delayed.   Confirmatory scans will 
be performed after 6 weeks (± 7 days)  during the first 
24 weeks and every 9 weeks thereafter .  
6. With the CDC guidance that recommends the 
administration of the vaccine to immunocompromised 
patients, it has been decided to r emov e the COVID -19 
related inclusion criterion ( previously #12) and a 
clarification has been added to refer to the CDC 
guidelines for  recommendations on the timing of the 
vaccine under section “ 14.7.2 Recommendations for 
the study patients regarding COVID -19 Vaccines ”. 
7. Survival follow up time has been changed to allow 
longer overall survival assessment from ‘ [ADDRESS_158841] has been enrolled’  to ‘[ADDRESS_158842] into 
the trial ’. 
8. Due to accumulating data with NAP in several 
clinical trials, it has been decided to ease the burden 
of safety labs and remove  the following tests: 
a) CBC and Serum Chemistry were previously 
collected on screening, day -12, and then on day 
[ADDRESS_158843] been changed to  
be collected at screening, day -12 and then day 1 
of each cycle but day 4 will be collected only on 
cycles 1, 2 and 3.  Both will also be collected at 
EOT as previously done  and as clinically 
indicated .

Page 8 of 113 b) Urinalysis was previously collected on screening, 
day 1 of each cycle , day 15  and at EOT. This has 
been changed in this amendment to be collected 
at screening, C1D1 , EOT  and as clinically 
indicated . 
c) Coag ulation panel was previously collected at 
screening, C1D4, C1D15, C4D1 and EOT visit. 
The tests during NAP treatments have been 
removed, however due to a known risk of 
Disseminated I ntravascular Coagulation (DIC) 
related to  obinutuzumab treatment, [ADDRESS_158844] been added at D -12 and at C1D1  
prior to NAP treatment (screening and EOT 
timepoints have not been changed) .  
Changes are implemented  on section 6: Study 
Procedures and section 7: Assessments.  
9. ECG was previously assessed at screening, at 5min 
(+3min) post NAP initiation time on: C1D1, C1D4, 
C4D1, C4D4 , and at EOT visit. All  timepoints during 
the treatment have been removed and ECG will be 
performed at screening, EOT and as clinically 
indicated throughout the study .  This revision  is done 
under sections 6 & 7 .  Rationale:  Data from two 
ongoing clinical studies conducted with NAP (13 
patients in t he current P2 study  and 50 patients in an 
ongoing  P1 study  of NAP and durvalumab following 
pre-treatmen t of obinutuzumab) , in addition to  safety 
data from past clinical trials  in over 300 patients 
treated with NAP, were reviewed  for ECG 
assessments  at various timepoints . Specific data from 
the current study were reviewed for  ECGs at the time 
of the peak plasma levels of NAP , at the following 
timepoints : 
• 13 patients on C1D1  
• 13 patients on C1D4  
• 9 patients on C4D1  
• 8 patients on C4D4  
• 5 patients at End of Study visit 
No significant abnormalities and/ or shifts from 
baseline , including QTcF change s, were detected at 
any of those timepoints.  
In addition – neither AEs no r SAEs were identified to 
be related  to any ECG abnormalities.  Important to 
note, the challenge of multiple protocol procedures  
NeoTX  
Protocol NT -NAP -102-1 
Protocol Version –8.[ADDRESS_158845] NAP 
administration . The ECG as well as PK sample 
collection and vital signs – all are requested at the 
same timepoint, which is a significant challenge for 
those taking care of the patients . 
10. Added clarifications (section 5.2.7) for dose delay  of 
NAP  between cycles , allowing [ADDRESS_158846] in 
the study.  
12. Correction of a typographical error for vital signs 
collection  after the end of the obinutuzumab infusion. 
Corrected to ‘ every 30 minutes (± 5 min) for 1 hour 
after the end  of the infusion’ instead of ‘1 hour after 
start of the infusion’. This correction is done under 
sections 6 & 7.  
13. A clarification has been added to section 7.2.[ADDRESS_158847] it 
in the next scheduled visit . 
Amendment 7, 
version 8.0  12-Dec-22 1. Collection of available results in patients’ medical  
history of NGS results, TMB (tumor mutational 
burden) and PD -L1 to better understand if these 
biomarkers can be predictive of response.   This 
addition is done under sections : “abbreviation”, 1.1, 
2.1.3, 2.2.3  and 3. Changes are also implemented in 
section s 6 and 7.  
2. Section 1.6:  Dose Selection Rationale and Risk  was 
update d with ongoing P1b study data and the study 
number in NIH website.  
3. Change in the regimen of NAP , starting cycle 7 , to 
dose only on Day 1 instead of day s 1-4. Starting 
Cycle 7, NAP may be increased to  15 μg/kg and will 
be administered on Day 1 followed by  [CONTACT_140030] 2, in 21 days treatment cycles. Once docetaxel 
has been discontinued (either completed or stopped 
for toxicity), NAP as monotherapy will be given on a 
28-day cycle , but not earlier than C7. In patients 
whose NAP dose was reduced due to toxicities during 
NeoTX  
Protocol NT -NAP -102-1 
Protocol Version –8.1 25-Dec-22 
  
Confidential  
Page 10 of 113 cycles 1 -6, NAP dose will not be further increased in 
cycle 7. Rationale: After 6 cycles only a booster dose 
may be needed every cycle. Reducing days of NAP 
treatment will simplify the schedule and regimen of 
NAP. Dose increase to 15 μg/kg given only on day 1 
is not expected to increase NAP toxicity profile, as 
NAP related toxicities predominantly occur on cycles 
1-2 based on  collected data with 15 μg/kg on days 1 -
4. Changes are implemented in  sections 1.6, 3, 5.1, 
5.2.2, 5.2.6, 6 and 7.   
4. NAP premedication in section 5.2.5:  IV fluids 
recommendations have been updated to avoid excess 
of IV fluid  and paracetamol dose was adjusted to 
comply with standard paracetamol commercial doses 
(500-650mg).   
5. A Clarification  has been added in section 4.5 that 
patients may be  re-screen ed if failed previous 
screening.  
6. NAP administration time has been updated to allow to 
shorten the time if no IRRs ≥G2 occurred in a 
previous full cycle. A clarification that any IV fluids 
given simultaneously with NAP are prohibited  has 
also been added . All changes implemented in  section 
5.2.[ADDRESS_158848]’s weight.  
8. NAP dose modification table in section 5.2.6 has been 
updated for cases of G3 or G4 NAP related 
hematologic AEs, the next cycle dose will be reduced 
only if has not been resolved to G2.  
9. Update of section 5.4, Prohibited concomitant 
medication, and section 7, Concomitant medications: 
Hematopoietic growth factors ( e.g. G-CSF, 
erythropoietin ) and approved COVID treatments (e.g. 
Paxlovid) are allowed during the study.  
10. Biomarkers collection schedule update:  
Addition of samples  timepoints for PK , ADAs , Nab 
and HAMA:  collection on day 1 of every 2 cycles 
after cycle 6 .  Changes are done under sections 6 and 
7.5. 
11. Correction of typographical error s and other 
inconsistencies throughout  the protocol . 
12. A flexibility in the time of collection of safety lab 
tests on Day 1 of each cycle to allow a broader 
window: up to 72 hours prior to any study drug 
NeoTX  
Protocol NT -NAP -102-1 
Protocol Version –8.[ADDRESS_158849], thyroid  
panel and symptom directed physical exam .  Changes 
are done under sections 6 and 7.5.  
13. Reducing number of CBC and chemistry tests. Day 4 
– CBC and chemistry are to be taken on Day 4 of 
cycle 1 only , with a broader window of up to 24 
hours , but after the NAP administration on day 3. 
Changes are done under sections 6 and 7.5.  
14. Evaluation of disease (EOD): A dding brain MRI at 
screening with further follow up if positive . This 
change  is implemented in sections [ADDRESS_158850] NAP treatment has been 
updated as follows  and implemented in sections 5.2.2 , 
6 and 7.2.3 : 
During cycle 1 (days 1 -4) and cycle 2 Day 1 (C2D1), 
all subjects should be observed for [ADDRESS_158851] 
injection of NAP at the site.  If no G3 or higher 
infusion related reactions occurred, time of 
observation can be shortened to 1 hour on further 
treatment days.  Subjects who experience any TEAEs 
during the observation period and/or any other 
medical condition requiring further monitoring at the 
discretion of the investigator, should be further 
observed as clinically appropriate. Subjects should be 
advised t hat in any case of severe and/or persistent 
fever, chills, or shortness of breath beyond [ADDRESS_158852] NAP administration, they should seek a medical 
attention.  Rationale:   Data from two ongoing clinical 
studies conducted with NAP ( approximately 80  
patients)  show that most of the infusion related 
reactions occurred during the first cycle (mostly days 
1 and 2) and on the first day of the second cycle. 
Patients who did not experience any infusion related 
reactions during these treatment days were less pron e 
to experience any significant AEs on further treatment 
days. All those toxicities were manageable with

we can recommend on a shortened time of 
observat ion as described above.  
19. The exploratory objective and endpoint for  Nab 
analysis was removed as method is still under 
development.  
20. Repeated thyroid function lab tests will continue after 
treatment discontinuation only in subjects with 
abnormal results at EOT. Subjects will be followed up 
until resolution or initiation of a new anti -cancer 
treatment.  End of Study term was removed as it is no 
longer needed . Changes were implemented in Table 2 
and section 7.2.5.  
21. Day -12 treatment will be delayed if platelet count is 
below 75,000 /µL, coagulation abnormalities and/or 
any signs and symptoms of bleeding or thrombosis  
are present. The second obinutuzumab dose can be 
delayed by [CONTACT_2006] -7. Any further delay in 
obinutuzumab dosing is to be discussed with the 
Medical Monitor.  Implemented in section 5.3.4.  
22. Inclusion criterion #11 has been changed to add an 
exception “if discussed with the Medical Monitor”.  
Amendment 7,

TREATMENT  NAP   
BACKGROUND AND 
RATIONALE  Prior to the era of checkpoint inhibitors (CPIs), docetaxel given as a 
single agent was found to prolong survival vs. best supportive care, 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] a marginal effect on response rate, in patients with NSCLC 
previously treated with a platinum -based combination chemotherapy 
regimen ( 1). More recently, PD -1 and PD -L1 inhibitors were shown to 
further improve overall survival (OS) vs. docetaxel ( 2)(3)(4)(5). OS, 
including squamous and non -squamous NSCLC, was about 12 months 
for the CPIs vs. about 9 months for docetaxel, while there was no 
difference in progression -free survival (PFS).  At 12 months, however, 
the estimated PFS rates were generally around 20% for the CPIs and 
10% for docetaxel ; the PFS rate at 6 months with docetaxel was 
approximately 30% . Overall, the response rates to CPIs varied 
between 14% and 20%, while the response rates to docetaxel varied 
between 9% and 13% . Docetaxel remains a standard of care for 
patients previously treated with CPIs . 
NAP is a recombinant protein with a Fab moiety  targeting the 5T4 
antigen fused with a genetically engineered superantigen moiety ( 6). 
The 5T4 antigen is an oncofetal  glycoprotein that is upregulated in 
most NSCLC (6)(7)(8). It is also present on stem cells.  The 
superantigen is responsible for initiating the inflammatory reaction 
that leads to tumor cell kill. In a first step, the bridging of T cell 
receptors and MHC class 2 molecules by [CONTACT_140031] T -cells, prim arily in peripheral lymph 
nodes, outside of the immunosuppressive tumor environment.  In the 
case of NAP, the superantigen has been specifically designed to bind 
very selectively  to the subset of T -cells expressing the TCRVβ 6.4 
(TRBV 7 -9) sequence on their T cell receptor, avoiding non -specific T 
cell over -stimulation.  In a second step, the traffic of T -cells is 
redirected towards tumors expressing the 5T4 antigen bound to NAP, 
NeoTX  
Protocol NT -NAP -102-1 
Protocol Version –8.[ADDRESS_158862]. In preclinical in 
vivo models, a murine version of NAP was found to result in 
synergistic antitumor activity in combination with docetaxel and 
checkpoint inhibitors ( 9)(10)(11)(12). 
More than [ADDRESS_158863] been treated with NAP, providing an 
extensive safety data base, but experience in NSCLC has been limited. 
In a small dose escalation trial of NAP and docetaxel in combination, 
one patient with an adenocarcinoma of the lung and l iver metastases 
achieved a partial response for 10+ years.  That patient had shown clear 
resistance to a prior docetaxel regimen ( 13). 
Antibodies binding to NAP (anti -SEA/E -120) may interfere with the 
exposure and activity of NAP.  Low levels of anti -drug antibodies 
(ADAs) may be present at baseline, but these levels do increase after 
initial exposure to NAP, potentially resulting in significant reduction 
in NAP blood levels in subsequent treatment cycles.  Obinutuzumab 
(14)(15), a new -generation, glycoengineered, humanized type [ADDRESS_158864] shown that T cells are activated 
and expand in similar frequencies when cultured with B cells, 
monocytes or both (16). In fact, CD14+ monocytes demonstrated a 
higher capacity to mediate the activation and expansion of TRBV7 -9+ 
T cells as compared to B cells. These observations suggest that CD14+ 
monocytes alone can efficiently mediate NAP activation and 
expansion of TRBV7 -9+ T cells in human blood. Hence, when given 
as a pretreatment, obinutuzumab, is expected to prevent the occurrence 
of ADAs and may result in more prolonged exposure to NAP, 
therefore potentially enhancing its antitumor activity. In this trial, 
obinutuzumab  will be given once, over [ADDRESS_158865] cycle of treatment with t he combination of NAP and 
docetaxel.  Additional administrations of obinutuzumab may be 
considered during the study based on biomarkers collected and B cell 
level .  
OBJECTIVES  Primary Objective s 
• To describe the objective response rate (ORR) and duration of 
response (DOR) with the combination of NAP / docetaxel,

Confidential  
Page 24 of 113 following obinutuzumab pre -treatment in subjects with 
checkpoint inhibitors pre -treated NSCLC  
 
Secondary Objectives  
• To describe the safety profile of the combination of NAP / 
docetaxel, following obinutuzumab pretreatment in subjects 
with relapsed/refractory ( R/R) NSCLC  
• To evaluate the overall survival (OS) defined as the time from 
day 1 of treatment until death due to any cause  
• To assess the possible impact of prior taxane exposure on the 
antitumor activity of the NAP/docetaxel combination  
• To describe the effect of obinutuzumab pretreatment on the 
development of anti -drug antibodies  and human anti -mouse 
antibodies to NAP  
• To describe blood levels over time of NAP when administered 
after B -cell suppression  
 
Exploratory Objectives  
• To evaluate and characterize the pharmacodynamic effect of 
NAP /docetaxel on biomarkers in the circulation  in subjects pre -
treated with obinutuzumab   
 
• Clinical activity in relation ship to biomarkers including 5T4, 
NGS results, TMB expression and PD -L1 level in the tumor.  
 
STUDY DESIGN  This is an open -label, multicenter, phase 2a clinical trial of the 
combination of NAP /docetaxel following pretreatment with 
obinutuzumab in subjects with NSCLC who have progressive 
neoplastic disease despi[INVESTIGATOR_139997] 2 prior 
system ic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], including a checkpoint inhibitor; approximately [ADDRESS_158866] treatment cycle, in order to 
reduce the titer of anti -drug antibodies to NAP.  Additional 
administrations of obinutuzumab may be considered during the study 
based on biomarkers collected and B cell level . If an increase back to 
the normal level  of B cell level is observed, additional biomarkers and 
PK level will be tested in the following visit. NAP will be 
administered in a  dose of 10 μg/kg/day by [CONTACT_91827] 1 – 4 of 
treatment cycle s 1-6, followed by [CONTACT_114501], 75 mg/m2 on Day 5.

Page 25 of 113 Treatment cycles with the combination N AP/docetaxel will be 21 days 
in duration. Growth factors may be used at the discretion of the 
investigators. The combination of NAP and docetaxel  will be given 
for a maximum of 8 cycles  (unless , in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871] , 
the patient may derive benefit from continuing docetaxel ). Starting 
Cycle 7, NAP at a higher dose of 15 μg/kg  will be administered on 
Day 1 and docetaxel on Day 2, in 21 days treatment cycles. Once NAP 
is given as monotherapy and not earlier than C7, cycles will be of 28 
days of duration. In patients whose NAP dose was reduced due to 
toxicities during cycles 1 -6, NAP dose will not be further increased in 
cycle 7. Dose increase to 15 μg/kg in advanced cycles is not expected 
to increase NAP toxicity profile, as NAP related toxicities 
predominantly occur on cycles [ADDRESS_158867] 1 and no more than 2 prior 
systemic regimens for the treatment of advanced/metastatic NSCLC. 
Patients are required to have progressed following treatment with both 
platinum -based chemotherapy and an anti -PD-L1 antibody 
administered either sequentially or concurrently. A prior PD -1/PD -L1 
inhibitor is, however, not required if there was prior exposure to 
targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_139998] (e.g. EGFR or 
ALK inhibitors).  Entry into this trial is restricted to patients with 
incurable disease, including those who relapse within [ADDRESS_158868] available 
archival or fresh tissue collected for the retrospective determination of 
tumoral 5T4 levels .  
Subjects will be assessed for the primary efficacy endpoint of 
objective response rate (ORR) according to the iRECIST criteria.  
Response duration is also a focus of interest in this study. In addition, 
disease control rate, combining the ORR with subjects demonstrating 
stable disease (SD), progression -free survival (PFS), PFS rate at 6 and 
12 months and overall survival (OS) will also be determined.  If 
available, NGS results, TMB expression and PD -L1 levels will be 
collected for the expression of explorator y tumor biomarkers . 
Ongoing study imaging will be performed at the end of cycle 2 (45 ± 
7 days)  and every [ADDRESS_158869] 24 weeks and then every 9 
weeks (± 7 days) thereafter. Confirmatory scans for responses (PR or 
CR) will be performed after 6 weeks (± 7 days)  during the first 24

Confidential  
Page 26 of 113 weeks and every 9 weeks thereafter . As NAP is known to induce an 
inflammatory reaction in the tumor, pseudo -progression may be 
observed and therefore, in patients who demonstrate objective 
progression but who are clinically stable, 1 -2 additional treatment 
cycle(s) of NAP/docetaxel may be a dministered beyond progression 
at the discretion of the Investigator, followed by a confirmat ory 
imaging as per the original schedule, every  6 weeks (± 7 days) 
during the first 24 weeks and every  9 weeks (± 7 days)  thereafter.   
The safety of the combination of NAP /docetaxel following 
pretreatment with obinutuzumab in a B -cell suppressed setting will be 
assessed in all treated subjects including adverse events, the results of 
ECGs, results of laboratory determinations, findings o n physical 
exams, vital signs and reporting of the ECOG Performance Score.  All 
treatment emergent A Es (TEAEs), drug -related A Es, SAEs and drug -
related SAEs as well as hematology and chemistry lab results will be 
summarized using the worst grade per subject  according to the NCI 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 
5.0. 
The pharmacokinetics of NAP will be based on plasma drug levels 
obtained at various timepoints after administration.   
The pharmacodynamics of the combination of NAP /docetaxel 
following pretreatment with obinutuzumab will be determined by 
[CONTACT_140032] (e.g., IL -2, IFNγ, IL -6 and TNFα) in 
serum.  
The immunogenicity of NAP will be assessed based on levels of anti -
drug antibodies  and human anti-murine  antibodies (HAMA) collected 
at various times after administration of NAP. Neutralizing antibodies 
(Nab) will be also collected and kept for future analysis.  
The primary efficacy endpoint of this trial is ORR. A Simon 2 -stage 
design will be use d with the following assumptions: H0=10%. H1= 
30%, α= 0.05 and power=0.80. Accordingly, the target  accrual is 29 
subjects.  Subjects who discontinue from treatment for any reason will 
continue to be followed for survival (even if the subject receives 
subsequent anti -neoplastic therapy).  Subjects will be followed for 
survival until [ADDRESS_158870]/MRI scans every [ADDRESS_158871] 24 weeks, every 9 weeks 
thereafter ; if such a subject receives subsequent anti -neoplastic

Protocol Version –8.[ADDRESS_158896] frequently occurring malignancies.  For 2020, it is estimated that there will be over 22 5,000 
new cases of lung cancer  and over 135,000  deaths from lung cancer in the U S; lung cancer remains 
the leading cause of cancer deaths in the US (17). Lung cancer also remains the most frequently 
reported cancer, and the leading cause of cancer deaths, worldwide (18). The most common type 
of lung cancer, non -small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), represents about 80% of all lung 
malignancies.  
For subject s with NSCLC whose tumors harbor known genetic mutations, agents targeted to these 
mutations have resulted in significant improvements in treatment.  Third generation agents targeted 
to the epi[INVESTIGATOR_3506], such as osimertinib, result in objective response rates 
(ORR) of over 75% and produce progression -free survival (PFS) times of over 18 months (19). 
Unfortunately, most of these subject s ultimately relapse, as additional driver mutations evolve in 
their tumors.  
The checkpoint inhibitor class of agents has probably had the most impact on outcomes in subject s 
with NSCLC, both in the 1st and 2nd line settings.  Marked improvement in response rates, durations 
of response, progression -free survival times and overall survival times have been demonstrated by 
[CONTACT_140036] -based doublet therapy  or to 
docetaxel . The degree of improvement in many of these outcomes, however, is often dependent 
on tumor proportional PD-L1 scores or the extent of tumor mutational burden  and not all subject s 
derive benefit  (20). Low tumor mutational burden (TMB) and low expression of PD -L1 have been 
associated with a high level of resistance to these inhibitors  (24, 25) . Lack of neoantigens on the 
tumor surface believed to attribute to anti PD -(L)1 resistance. Low TMB is a surrogate for the lack 
of neoantigens. NAP targeting causing tumor cells being covered by a superantigen, activates, 
expands, and redirects a subset of T-cells towards the tumor and generating tumor inflammation. 
This mechanism of action may presumably overcome tumor resistance to anti PD -(L)[ADDRESS_158897] on response rate  (1). In 
more contemporaneous studies comparing checkpoint inhibitors to docetaxel in patients failing 
platinum -based regimens, OS, including squamous and non -squamous NSCLC, was about 12 
months for the CPIs vs. about 9 months for docetaxel, while there was no difference in progression 
-free survival (PFS) (2)(3)(4)(5). At 12 months, however, the estimated PFS rates were generally 
around 20% for the CPIs and 10% for docetaxel ; the PFS rate at 6 months with docetaxel was 
approximately 30% . Overall, the response rates to CPIs varied between 14% and 20%, while the 
response rates to docetaxel varied between 9% and 13% . Docetaxel remains a standard of care for 
patients previously treated with CPIs, but it is clear that there remains a need for additional novel 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_140000] .

1.2 Naptumomab estafenatox  (NAP ) 
Naptumomab estafenatox  (ABR -217620; NAP ) was developed to activate and target subject s’ T-
cells to their own tumor s, by [CONTACT_140037] a superantigen (SAg) variant that activates T lymphocytes to 
the Fab moiety recognizing the tumor -associated oncofetal antigen 5T4, with the objective of 
eliciting a potent tumoricidal cytotoxic T cell response (6). The SAg moiety selectively engages 
the T cell receptor β variable (TRBV) [ADDRESS_158898] transmembrane glycoprotein that is broadly 
expressed on tumor cells of solid tumors but  has very low expression on normal adult tissues (7). 
It is also expressed on cancer stem cells which are hypothesized to be responsible for 
chemotherapeutic resistance and recurrence of cancer.  Significant upregulation of 5T4 has been 
reported in many types of carcinomas  (6)(7)(8). Studies have shown a homogenous 5T4 
expression, which in most cases is moderate to strong, in more than 95% of NSCLC tissue samples.  
The expression of 5T4 has been shown to influence adhesion, cytoskeletal organization, and 
motility, properties that might account for the 5T4 association with poorer clinical outcome in 
some cancers. The biology of 5T4 in normal and pathologic tissues is not well understood. No 
ligands or co -receptors have been identified for 5T4 to date and there is no evidence of circulating 
5T4 antigens.  
NAP ’s superantigen moiety represents the culmination of a long development program in which 
genetically engineered versions of superantigen were tested in the clinic until epi[INVESTIGATOR_140001]. In pre -clinical and clinical studies, NAP  has demonstrated recognition enhancement: it 
induced T cell expansion, activation and infiltration into the tumor without undo safety concerns 
(7). This effect of NAP makes it an ideal drug for combination with different cancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_140002],  checkpoint inhibitors  and CAR T cells . 
 
1.3 Naptumomab estafenatox  (NAP ) Mechanism of Action  
In the first phase of NAP  treatment, T lymphocytes are activated and differentiate into effector 
cells (expansion phase, Fig. 2). In the second phase, the activated T cells localize and infiltrate to 
the tumor and mediate their anti -tumor actions (attack phase, Fig. 2). 
The expansion phase is mediated by [CONTACT_140038]. Superantigens act as potent mitogens for 
human T cells. Unlike conventional antigens, these SAgs bind to MHC class II on antigen -
presenting cells (APC) outside of the conventional peptide -binding groove an d stimulate T cells 
expressing specific TCR Vβ -chains, resulting in stimulation of a high proportion of T cells. SAgs 
activate both CD4 and CD8 T cells, and under certain circumstances CD4 T cells can also be 
cytotoxic to cells displaying the superantigen.  Unlike the wild type superantigen, the SEA/E120 
moiety of NAP was designed to bind to a specific subset of T cells expressing TCRVβ 7.9 (TRBV 
7-9). NAP , via its SEA/E120 moiety , binds with intermediate/low affinity to the TCRVβ 7.9 and 
to MHC II, enabling the bridge between the T cell and APC. As a consequence, T cells are activated

Confidential  
Page 37 of 113 and proliferate. Since only 2 -5% of human T cells express TCR Vβ 7.9, this expansion phase is 
limited, ensuring a superior saf ety profile of the drug.  
In the second phase of NAP treatment, by [CONTACT_53167] 5T4 antigen on the tumor cells, NAP 
molecules act as guiding beacons for the SAg -activated T cells, directing them to the tumor 
microenvironment. The activated T cells bind to the cancer cells through TCR -SAg interaction 
which enables their activation and the resulting tumor killing by [CONTACT_140039] 5T4 -
positive tumor cells and by [CONTACT_140040] -negative tumor cell variants 
by [CONTACT_140041] (paracrine  effect) (6). NAP recognizes the 5T4 antigen with an affinity 
in the order of 1nM and induces T cell -mediated killing of tumor cells at concentrations around [ADDRESS_158899] of NAP  or NAP ’s surrogate 
murine molecule, C215Fab -SEA, in combination with checkpoint inhibitors (anti PD -(L)-1 and 
anti CTLA4) and cancer chemotherapeutic agents such as docetaxel  (9)(10)(11)(12). Treatment of 
B16-C215 tumor bearing mice with the combination of C215Fab -SEA and docetaxel was found 
to be more effective in reducing the number of lung tumors as compared to mono therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. 
Interestingly, it was shown that docetaxel at therapeutic doses  did not interfere with superantigen 
induced T cell activation but rather appeared to enhance the response. Furthermore, C215Fab -SEA 
and docetaxel therapy synergistically prolonged long -term survival of the B16 -C215 tumor bearing 
mice suggesting potential clinical benefit for the combined use (Fig. 3 ) (10).

1.5.1 Phase 1  Monotherapy Trial  
The safety and tolerability of NAP  were assessed in a multicenter, multinational, open -label, phase 
1, dose -escalation study (N=39), involving single -agent NAP  administered as a bolus injection in 
subject s with non -small cell lung cancer (N=20), renal cell carcinoma (N=11) or pancreatic cancer 
(N=8) at doses ranging from 0.5 -27.4 µg/kg/day x 5 consecutive days (13).  
The pharmacokinetics of NAP showed a small volume of distribution (about 0.10 L/kg) and a low 
clearance (about 0.11 L/h/kg). The terminal half -life was determined to be about 1.[ADDRESS_158901] s, there was a low (0  - 100 pmol/mL) to 
intermediate (100  - 500 pmol/mL) increase in the levels of anti -SEA/E -[ADDRESS_158902] frequent adverse reactions were nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, hypotension, chills, and 
fever.  The frequency and severity of AEs increased with increasing doses of NAP , but the majority 
of AEs (92%) were grade 1 or grade 2 in severity.  Transient liver enzyme elevations were also 
encountered. Dose -limiting toxicities (DLTs) occurred at doses above 20 µg/kg/day x [ADDRESS_158903] s (36%) had stable disease (SD) on day 56: seven NSCLC (25%) and seven RCC 
(64%) subject s. The recommended phase 2 dosage was set at 15 μg/kg/day for subject s with RCC 
and 22 μg/kg/day for subject s with NSCLC and pancreatic cancer.  
 
1.5.2 Phase 1 Trial in Combination with Docetaxel in NSCLC  
Increasing doses of NAP  (10.3, 16.5, 22 µg/kg) and docetaxel were administered to 13 subjects 
with advanced NSCLC.  NAP  was administered on Days 1 – 4 and docetaxel on Day 5 of each 
treatment cycle.  Two patients achieved a partial response, and 5 achieved stable disease.  One of 
the partial responders  had demonstrated previous resistance to docetaxel  and remained in 
remission for 10+ years . That patient had received NAP  at the highest dose of 22 µg/kg. The most 
frequently reported AEs were fever, hypotension, nausea, chills tachycardia, neutropenia and 
asthenia.  The majority (87%) of these AE s were grade [ADDRESS_158904] 
required a dose reduction in docetaxel from 75 mg/m2 to 55 mg/m2 due to neutropenia.  
As with NAP monotherapy, there was a marked increase in the levels of blood cytokines 3 hours 
after administration.  While IL -2 and IFNγ were primarily increased during Cycle 1, IL -6 and IL -
10 levels also increased during Cycle 2.  Repeat tumor biopsies on treatment were obtained from 2 
subjects treated at the higher dose of NAP and demonstrated enhanced tumor -associated T -cell 
infiltration during NAP  treatment; [ADDRESS_158905] with the markedly prolonged

1.5.3 Phase 2/3 
A randomized (1:1) phase 2/[ADDRESS_158906] s with renal cell carcinoma 
with NAP (15 µg/kg/day x 4 consecutive days on weeks 1, 9 and 17) and interferon alpha or 
interferon alpha alone did not meet its primary endpoint and failed to show a survival benefit for 
the tested combination (21). In a post -hoc exploratory subgroup analysis, subject s wit h less than 
the median concentrations of anti -NAP antibodies and IL -6, significantly benefitted from addition 
of NAP . In this subgroup, the median overall survival (OS)/progression -free survival (PFS) was 
63.3/13.7 months versus 31.1/5.[ADDRESS_158907] s receiving IFN alone (p=0.02, hazard 
ratio 0.59/p=0.02, hazard ratio 0.62). Most of the adverse events resulting from treatment with 
NAP , related to increased levels of cytokines.  Pyrexia (61%), vomiting (37%), nausea (35%), 
chills (27%), and back pain (19.5%) were the more common adverse events reported in the NAP 
treatment arm.  Grade 3 hypotension occurred in 2% of subject s. The adverse events were transient, 
often mild and no Grade 4 or 5 toxicities were observed.  
Antibodies binding to NAP (anti-SEA/E -120) may interfere with drug exposure and efficacy. At 
baseline, only low levels of anti -SEA/E -[ADDRESS_158908] treatment 
cycle, anti -SEA/E -[ADDRESS_158909] of 
NAP . IFN -α is known to accelerate the formation of antidrug antibodies (ADA) (22), which might 
account for the high ADAs titers seen in the study, resulting in significant reduction in the NAP 
blood levels in cycles 2 and 3.  
 
1.6 Dose Selection Rationale  and Risk  
In the previously conducted phase 1 trials, n o DLTs were observed at doses up to 20 µg/kg in the 
initial phase [ADDRESS_158910] frequent adverse reactions consisted of  nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, 
hypotension, chills, fever and back pain.  Transient liver enzyme elevations were also encountered. 
Dose -limiting toxicities (DLTs) occurred at doses above 20 µg/kg/day x 5 and included fever, 
hypotension, liver toxicity and acute vascular leak syndrome. These DLTs were reversible with no 
significa nt long -term con sequences.   
Antibodies binding to NAP  (anti-SEA/E -120) may interfere with the exposure and activity of 
NAP . Low levels of anti -drug antibodies (ADAs) may be present at baseline but these levels are 
expected to increase after initial exposure to NAP , as has been seen in previous clinical trials, 
potentially resulting in significant reduction in NAP  blood levels in subsequent treatment cycles.  
Obinutuzumab, a new -generation, glycoengineered, humanized type 2 anti -CD20 monoclonal 
antibody currently approved for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia and follicular 
lymphoma, depletes B cells  and can eliminate the formation of ADAs, presumably without 
adversely impacting on T cell activation nor on dosing, activity or safety of NAP . Hence, when

the combination of NAP  and docetaxel.  Additional administrations of obinutuzumab may be 
considered during the study based on biomarkers collected and B cells level . 
In an ongoing dose escalation and cohort expansion phase 1 trial of a 3 -weekly regimen, NAP is 
given daily for 4 consecutive days in combination with durvalumab given on day 2  
([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) . NAP was tested  at 5 dose levels of  2, 5, 10,15 and 20 µg/kg/d ay (N=19) . Two 
of six patients treated at the highest dose level experienced a DLT on day 1, an excessive infusion 
reaction in the first patient and creatinine elevation in a second patient who already had an 
abnormal creatinine level at baseline. The  MTD was established at 15 µg/kg/day. The trial then 
incorporated  obinutuzumab pre -treatment  at two dose levels of NAP , 10 µg/kg/d ay and 15 
µg/kg/d ay, with unremarkable safety findings  (N=7) .  Among these initial [ADDRESS_158912] response: 1 CR for 24+ months in pancreatic cancer, 1 CR in a patient with cervical 
cancer, 1 PR for 17+ months in hepatocarcinoma resistant to prior nivolumab and 1 PR for 13 
months in PD -L1 low peritoneal mesothelioma.  The trial went on with expansion cohort s treated 
with NAP 10-15 µg/kg/d ay in combination with durvalumab and obinutuzumab pretreatment. At 
the higher dose level of NAP, 3 out of 13 subjects experienced grade 3 infusion reactions related 
to NAP (fever, chills, dyspnea and hypotension) , which led to treatment discontinuation .  In the 
total of  11 patients who received NAP 10 µg/kg/d ay in combination with durvalumab and 
obinutuzumab pretreatment, two subjects experienced grade 3 IRRs (chills in one patient and 
worsening of grade 2 dyspnea that predated NAP treatment  in the other ). No patients had treatment 
discontinuation for safety at that dose level of NAP. All those toxicities were manageable with 
appropriate medical treatment, rapi[INVESTIGATOR_140003] -term sequelae. Based on this 
experience, t he dose of 10 µg/kg /day for NAP has bee n selected as the recommended dose for  the 
current trial . Dose increase to 15 μg/kg in advanced cycles is  not expected to increase NAP  toxicity 
profile, as NAP related toxicities predominantly occur on cycles 1 -2, and this dose increase may 
overcome ADA formation with time.  
Additional information regarding NAP can be found in the current investigator’s brochure.  
 
1.7 Obinutuzumab  
Obinutuzumab  is a humanized anti -CD20 monoclonal antibody that recognizes a specific epi[INVESTIGATOR_140004]20 on B cells.  Upon binding to CD20, obinutuzumab  mediates B -cell lysis through 1) 
engagement of immune effector cells,  2) by [CONTACT_140042] (direct cell death), and/or  3) activation of the complement cascade.  It is currently

Page 42 of 113 clinical study BO21004/CLL11, 91% (40 out of 44) of evaluable patients treated with repeated 4 -
week cycles of obinutuzumab, were B -cell depleted (CD19+ B -cell counts < 0.07 x 109/L) at the 
end of treatment period and remained depleted during the first 6 mo nths of follow up. Recovery 
of B-cells was observed within 12 -18 months of follow up in 35% (14 out of 40) of patients without 
progressive disease and 13% (5 out of 40) with progressive disease  (15). In vitro studies have 
shown that T cells are activated and expand in similar frequencies when cultured with B cells, 
monocytes or both  (16). In fact, CD14+ monocytes demonstrated a higher capacity to mediate the 
activation and expansion of TRBV7 -9+ T cells as compared to B cells. These observations suggest 
that CD14+ monocytes alone can efficiently mediate NAP activation and expansion of TRBV7 -
9+ T cells in human blood. Given these observations, ADA prevention with obinutuzumab is 
expected to deplete B cells, without impacting the NAP mode of action.  Hence, when given as a 
pretreatment, obinutuzumab, is expected to prevent the occurrence of ADAs and may result in 
more prolonged exposure to NAP , therefore potentially enhancing its antitumor activity.  In this 
trial, obinutuzumab will be given once, over [ADDRESS_158913] cycle of treatment with the 
combination of NAP  and docetaxel.  Additional administrations of obinutuzumab may be 
considered during the study based on biomarkers collected and B cells level.  
 
1.8 Study Rationale   
Given the ongoing need for novel therapi[INVESTIGATOR_140006], the previously observed 
preliminary activity of the combination of NAP /docetaxel in NSCLC and the presumptive ability 
of obinutuzumab to suppress the development of ADAs, this study will test the combination of 
NAP /docetaxel following pretreatment with obinutuzumab in a population of subjects with 
NSCLC who have failed checkpoint inhibitor  therapy, in an effort to demonstrate an improvement 
in ORR as well as other measures of anti -tumor efficacy .

Page 45 of 113 3 STUDY DESIGN  
This is an open -label, multicenter  Phase 2a  clinical trial of the combination of NAP /docetaxel 
following pretreatment with obinutuzumab  in subjects with NSCLC who have progressive 
neoplastic disease despi[INVESTIGATOR_139997] 2 prior systemic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] , including a 
checkpoint inhibitor ; approximately [ADDRESS_158914] treatment cycle  in order to reduce the titer of anti -drug antibodies to NAP . Additional 
administrations of obinutuzumab may be considered during the study based on biomarkers 
collected and B cell level . If an increase  back to the normal level  of B cell level is observed, 
additional biomarkers and PK level will be tested in the following visit. NAP  will be 
administered in a daily dose of 10 μg/kg by [CONTACT_91827] 1  - 4 of treatment cycle s 1-6, 
followed by [CONTACT_114501], 75 mg/m2 on Day 5.   
Treatment cycles will be 21 days in duration  and growth factors may be used at the discretion of 
the investigator . The combination of NAP /docetaxel  will be given for a maximum of 8  cycles  
(unless,  in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871] , the patient may derive benefit from continuing 
docetaxel ). Starting Cycle 7, NAP at a higher dose of 15 μg/kg  will be administered on Day 1 and 
docetaxel on Day 2, in 21 days treatment cycles. Once NAP is given as monotherapy and not 
earlier than C7, cycles will be of 28 days of duration. In patients whose NAP dose was reduced 
due to toxicities during cycles 1 -6, NAP dose will not be further increased in cycle 7. Dose increase 
to 15 μg/kg  in advanced cycl es is not expected to increase NAP toxicity profile, as NAP related 
toxicities predominantly occur on cycles [ADDRESS_158915] 1 and no more than 2 prior systemic regimens for the treatment of 
advanced/metastatic NSCLC. Patients are required to have progressed following treatment with 
both platinum -based chemotherapy and an anti -PD-(L)1 antibody administered either sequenti ally 
or concurrently. A prior PD -1/PD -L1 inhibitor is, however, not required if there was prior exposure 
to targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_140007] (e.g. EGFR or ALK inhibitors).  Entry 
into this trial is restricted to patients with incurabl e disease, including those who relapse within [ADDRESS_158916] available archival or 
fresh tissue collected for the retrospective determination of tumoral 5T4 levels.   
Subjects will be assessed for the primary efficacy endpoint of objective response rate (ORR) . ORR 
will be assessed according to the iRECIST criteria.  In addition , disease control rate, combining the 
ORR with subjects demonstrating stable disease (SD), progression -free survival (PFS), PFS rate 
at 6 and 12 months  and overall survival (OS) will also be determined.  If available, NGS results, 
TMB expression and PD -L1 levels will be collected for the expression of exploratory tumor 
biomarkers.  
Ongoing study imaging will be performed at the end of cycle 2 (45 days ± 7 days) and every [ADDRESS_158917] 24 weeks and then every 9 weeks (± 7 days) thereafter. Confirmatory scans  for 
responses (PR or CR) will be performed after 6 weeks (± 7 days)  during the first 24 weeks and 
NeoTX

Page 46 of 113 every 9 weeks thereafter . As NAP is known to induce an inflammatory reaction in the tumor, 
pseudo -progression may be observed and therefore, in patients who demonstrate objective 
progression but who are clinically stable, 1 -2 additional treatment cycle(s) of NAP/docetaxel may 
be ad ministered beyond progression at the discretion of the Investigator, followed by a 
confirmat ory imaging after 6 weeks (± 7 days) during the first 24 weeks and every 9 weeks (± 7 
days) thereafter.  This schedule should be maintained  even if cycles are delayed.  
The s afety of the combination of NAP /docetaxel following pretreatment with obinutuzumab  in a 
B-cell suppressed setting  will be assessed in all treated subjects based on the reporting of adverse 
events, the results of ECGs, results of laboratory determinations, findings on physical exams , vital 
signs  and reporting of the ECOG Performance Score . All treatment emergent AEs  (TEAEs) , drug-
related A Es, SAEs and drug -related SAEs as well as hematology and chemistry lab results will be 
summarized using the worst grade per subject  according to the NCI Common Terminology Criteria 
for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0  
The pharmacokinetics of NAP  will be based on plasma drug levels obtained at various timepoints 
after administration.   
The pharmacodynamics of the combination of NAP /docetaxel following pretreatment with 
obinutuzumab  will be determined by [CONTACT_140032] (e.g., IL -2, IFNγ, IL -6 and 
TNFα) in s erum. 
The immunogenicity of NAP will be assessed based on levels of anti -drug antibodies, human anti-
murine antibodies (HAMA) collected at various times after administration of NAP . Neutralizing 
antibodies (Nab) will be also collected for future analys is.  
The primary efficacy endpoint of this trial is the ORR.  With 29 evaluable entries , 6 subjects or 
more with a complete or partial response would make this regimen worth y of further investigation . 
Subjects who discontinue from treatment for any reason will continue to be followed for survival 
(even if the subject receives subsequent anti -neoplastic therapy).  Subjects will be followed for 
survival until [ADDRESS_158918]/MRI scans every 6 wee ks (± 7 days)  for the first 24 weeks, every 9 weeks (± 7 
days) thereafter ; if such a subject receives subsequent anti -neoplastic therapy, further follow -up 
for progression will stop.

Docetaxel will be administered IV over 1 hour on Day 5 of cycles 1 -6 and starting cycle 7 on Day 
2  of a 21- day treatment cycle in a dose of 75 mg/m2 for a maximum of 8 cycles  (unless , in the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], the patient may derive benefit from continuing docetaxel) .  
Subjects should be pre -medicated according to institutional standards.  Docetaxel should be stored 
according to directions in the Full Prescribing Information . For complete  information regarding 
administration of docetaxel, refer to the appropriate Full Prescribing Information , SmPC or local 
product monograph.  
5.1.[ADDRESS_158937] of 
care at each clinical site . If corticosteroids  are administered in multiple days regimen, starting 1 
day prior to docetaxel  (on Day 4  of each cycle  1-6, and starting cycle 7 on Day 1 ) it should be 
administered at least  1 hour after NAP administration.  
5.1.2 Docetaxel Dose Adjustments  
Dose of docetaxel may remain the same throughout the study unless the patient’s weight changes 
≥10% from baseline.  
If docetaxel cannot be administered on schedule because of NAP -induced adverse reactions , 
docetaxel is to be delayed by a maximum of one week and skipped in the absence of adequate 
recovery; the next NAP cycle is then delayed by a maximum of one week as well, as described in 
sections 5.2.6 and 5.2.7.   
If NAP is discontinued, docetaxel may continue as monotherapy, as described in section 5. 1. If on 
the day of scheduled treatment with docetaxel, the ANC is <1,500/μL and/or the platelet count is 
<100,000/μL, hold docetaxel and repeat the ANC and platelet counts  weekly . Once toxicity due to 
myelosuppression has resolved  re-treatment with docetaxel will be at a reduced dose as described 
below.  If a second dose delay is required  due to  myelosuppression despi[INVESTIGATOR_140009] , 
discontinue docetaxel . Patient s who develop ≥grade [ADDRESS_158938] 
docetaxel treatment discontinued entirely.  If NAP and docetaxel are to be delayed due to toxicity 
of docetaxel, the whole cycle of NAP and docetaxel may be delayed up to 6 weeks. Patients, for 
whom any treatment cycle is delayed, for any reason, beyond the indicated window, will be 
discussed with the medical monitor to determine whether they should be continued.  The schedule 
of the imaging should be maintained, though, even if cycles are delayed .If docetaxel is discontinued 
due to toxicity, Day 5 (Cycles 1 -6) or Day 2 (cycle 7 onwards) assessments should not be performed.  
Docetaxel Dose Reduction  
The dose of docetaxel must be reduced to 55 mg/m2 in the event the subject experiences any of the 
following during a treatment cycle:  
• Febrile neutropenia

5.2 Naptumomab Estafenatox  (NAP ; ABR -217620)  
Naptumomab estafenatox  (NAP ; ABR -217620) is a recombinant fusion protein consisting of a 
chimeric staphylococcal enterotoxin A/E (SEA/SEE) superantigen with several additional 
substitutions that is linked to a Fab moiety recognizing a tumor -associated glycoprotein, 5T4.  
 
5.2.1 Naptumomab Estafenatox  (NAP) Packaging and Labeling  
 Naptumomab estafenatox  (NAP ) is provided in two separate packaging: One lyophilized drug 
product stored at 2 -8 ⁰C and one dilution kit stored at RT. A dilution kit containing water for 
injection (WFI), Dilution Solution, empty sterile glass vial, syringes and complete instructions for 
the reconstitution and dilution is also supplied. NAP  is provided as a lyophilized powder for 
injection. The container -closure system consists of 10 cc colorless glass, type I vials and 
bromobutyl stoppers. The vials are seal ed with aluminum caps. Each vial contains 1.25  mg NAP  
and is intended to be reconstituted and diluted prior to use in two steps: Reconstitution with 1.2ml 
of the supplied water for injection (WFI) followed by [CONTACT_140044] (Dilution 
Solution). The Dilution Solution is a sterile, pyrogen -free, clear and colorless solution supplied in 
[ADDRESS_158939] may contain residual trace kanamycin from the manufacturing process, which could 
lead to allergic reactions in highly susceptible individuals.  
 
5.2.2 Naptumomab Estafenatox  (NAP ) Preparation and Administration  
A dilution kit is supplied for dilution of NAP . All handling of NAP  should be performed using an 
aseptic technique. Sterile gloves should be used. For safety precautions, see Safety Data Sheet for 
NAP (provided separately) .  
NAP  will be administered in a dose of 10 μg/kg /day on Days 1 – 4 of cycles 1 -6. Starting Cycle 7, 
NAP will be administered on Day 1 only in a dose of 15 µg/kg (unless the dose was previously 
reduced due to toxicity).  The reconstituted NAP will be diluted with the supplied diluent to reach 
the required dose for administration. Fully diluted NAP (5 mL) will be administered as an IV slow 
bolus injection (i.e., administered directly, not via a running IV line). On cycle 1, i t could either 
be administered via central line (e.g. Port-a-Cath ), slowly injected in approximately 3 minutes

Page 56 of 113 followed by 10 mL slow (~2 min) saline flush or via a peripheral line (e.g. venflon), by a slow 
injection of approximately 5 minutes, followed by a flush per the site’s standard practice .  
If the subject  did not experience any significant infusion related reactions on a full cycle  (days 1 -
4), further NAP injections in the following cycle s may be pushed in less than 5 min in total.  
Any IV fluids given simultaneously with NAP are prohibited.  
Administration of NAP  should be performed by [CONTACT_140045], Good Clinical Practice 
(GCP) -trained, and experienced member of the study staff (e.g., physician, nurse, physician’s 
assistant, nurse practitioner, pharmacist, or medical assistant), as allowed by [CONTACT_140046].  
During cycle 1  (days 1 -4) and cycle 2 Day 1  (C2D1), all subjects should be observed  for [ADDRESS_158940] injection  of NAP at the site.  I f no G3 or higher infusion related reactions  occurred, time of 
observation can be shortened to 1 hour on further treatment days .  Subjects who experience any 
TEAEs during the observation period and/or any other medical condition requiring further 
monitoring at the discretion of  the investigator, should be further observed  as clinically 
appropriate. Subjects should be advised that in any case of severe and/or persistent fever, chills,  or 
shortness of breath beyond [ADDRESS_158941] NAP administration , they should seek a medical 
attention.  
5.2.3 Naptumomab Estafenatox  (NAP ) Dilution  
Calculation for dilution will be performed by [CONTACT_140047] 
“Flow chart of Dilution Procedure” (found in the pharmacy manual), which must be accurately 
filled in and signed. All dilutions should be performed by [CONTACT_140048].  
The calculation of the dose per subject weight should be done based on  subject weight on the day 
of treatment. In sites restricted by [CONTACT_966]’s procedures the dose can be calculated based on  
subject weight obtained within [ADDRESS_158942]'s weight should NOT be rounded off to the closest kg value but rather 
recorded with 1 digit after the decimal point, for example, 70.5 kg, 60.4, 77.0 kg etc. However, 
after multiplying the we ight by [CONTACT_140049] (µg/kg), the final dose (in µg) should be 
rounded off, for example, 120.5 µg will be rounded to 121 µg and 150.4 µg will be rounded to 150 
µg. 
5.2.4 Stability of Reconstituted and Diluted Naptumomab Estafenatox  (NAP ) 
For stability information on reconstituted and diluted NAP please refer to the IFU (Information 
For Use)  and the Pharmacy Manual .  
5.2.5 Premedication  for Naptumomab Estafenatox  (NAP )  
The premedication  should be initiated as prophylaxis prior to each NAP administration .

o Days 2-4: no hydration is needed unless the patient experienced G≥2 hypotension or 
G≥3 infusion related reactions on previous days, and then continue as on Day 1.  
No hydration is needed on further cycles.  
The saline hydration should be completed as close as possible to start of NAP 
administration.  
Excess of IV fluids should be avoided in elderly patients who are prone to develop fluid 
overload (e.g., congestive heart failure, renal failure etc.). In such cases it is recommended 
to consult the medical monitor.  
• 500-650 mg acetaminophen, oral, qid (x 4/day), unless specific contraindications exist 
(allergy or elevated hepatic transaminases), to be administered  30-[ADDRESS_158943] NAP dose of each cycle of NAP  treatment. In case of fever > 38.5oC the acetaminophen 
dose can be elevated to 1g to treat the AE.  
• Systemic antihistamine , such as but not limited to promethazine IV, 30 to 60 minutes prior 
to NAP dosing,  
• Anti-emetic agent such as ondansetron  8 mg or metoclopramide   10 mg, 30 to 60 minutes 
prior to NAP dosing.  
5.2.6 Dose Modifications for Naptumomab Estafenatox  (NAP )  
The following dose modifications of NAP are required in case of the occurrence of any Grade ≥3 
immune or non -immune AEs that are related to NAP . The dose of NAP will be reduced 
according to the table below; in general , NAP may be reduced by [CONTACT_140026] G3 AEs, and 
by [CONTACT_140027] G4, life -threatening AEs  (with the exception of hematologic toxicity and 
laboratory findings) . A second dose reduction is permitted for G3 AEs at one level reduced dose, 
with 5  µg/kg/d ay being  the lower dose allowed on this study.  NAP treatment will be permanently 
discontinued if same grade 3 or higher adverse event recurs  at 5 µg/kg/d ay reduced dose , (with 
the exception of hematologic toxicity and laboratory findings ). 
If, for any reason,  the dose was reduced at once  for a G3 toxicity , from 10 µg/kg/d  to 5 
µg/kg/d ay, and is tolerated well with no recurrences or further NAP related AEs at the reduced 
dose, then at the PI [INVESTIGATOR_9106], the dose may be increased  by [CONTACT_30560] , to 7.5 µg/kg/d ay, in 
the following  cycle.  
Please note, NAP is administered in a dose of 10 μg/kg/day on Days 1 – 4 of cycles 1 -6. Starting 
Cycle 7, NAP at a higher dose of 15 μg/kg  is administered on Day 1 . In patients whose NAP

Page 60 of 113 5.2.7 Dose Delays for Naptumomab  Esta fenatox  (NAP) /Docetaxel Combination  
Dose Delay Prior to Cycle 1  
In case of any obinutuzumab related toxicities of grade ≥[ADDRESS_158944] scheduled day of 
NAP administration (C1D1), Cycle 1 of NAP - docetaxel  treatment may be delayed up to 7 days. 
In the absence of resolution after this period, the patient will be discontinued from the study.  
 
Dose Delays During a Treatment Cycle  
Every effort should be made to administer NAP  on Days 1 – [ADDRESS_158945] treatment held until resolution of the toxicity to Grade 1 or baseline . The next NAP 
doses may be reduced by  [CONTACT_140052] G3 events and by [CONTACT_140027] G4 events, per 
investigator/Medical Monitor decision.  If a treatment needs to be delayed or is missed during days 
1-4, that treatment day will be skipped,  and treatment will resume the following day.  Missed 
treatments will not be made up.  Subject s who do not  receive at least two NAP doses within a given 
cycle at two consecutive cycles , due to AEs , will discontinue NAP and continue treatment with 
single agent docetaxel. If docetaxel cannot be administered once a treatment cycle has been 
initiated, docetaxel is to be delayed by a maximum of one week and skipped in the absence of 
adequate recovery; the next NAP cycle is then delayed by [CONTACT_140053].  
 
Dose Delay Between Treatment Cycles  
If on Day [ADDRESS_158946] not reverted to Grade 1 or baseline , or if the ANC is 
<1,500/μL and/or the platelet count is <100,000/μL,  treatment with NAP and doc etaxel should be 
held and the subject followed weekly until resolution of any toxicity or intercurrent condition to 
Grade 1 or baseline  and the ANC is >1,500/μL and the platelet count is >100,000/μL . If a delay is 
indicated for a cycle of N AP, the entire regimen of NAP + docetaxel is to be delayed.  If, in the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], toxicity due to NAP alone has not resolved by [ADDRESS_158947] 
NAP/docetaxel cycle, discontinue NAP and continue the subject on docetaxel alone.  Once toxicity 
of docetaxel due to myelosuppression has resolved , re-treatment with docetaxel will be at a 
reduced dose as described for docetaxel monotherapy. If a second dose delay is required due to 
myelosuppression despi[INVESTIGATOR_140009], discontinue docetaxe l and continue NAP alone.  
Delays for any reasons,  of up to 7 days  in the visit schedule of a full cycle (not within a cycle), are 
allowed. Patients, for whom any treatment cycle is delayed, beyond the indicated window, will be 
discussed with the medical monitor to determine whether they should be continued.  The schedule 
of the imaging should be maintained, though, even if cycles are delayed . 
 
5.3 Obinutuzumab  
Obinutuzumab  is a humanized anti -CD20 monoclonal antibody of the IgG1 subclass. It recognizes 
a specific epi[INVESTIGATOR_140011]20 molecule found on B cells. The molecular mass of the antibody is

Confidential  
Page 62 of 113 Administer at 50 mg/hr. The rate of the infusion can be escalated in 50 mg/hr increments every 30 
minutes to a maximum of 400 mg/hr.  
Day (-12) Administration  
CBC and coagulation lab test s are to be collected and results should be available prior to dosing. 
Day -12 treatment will be delayed if platelet count is below 75,000 /µL, coagulation abnormalities  
and/or  any signs and symptoms of bleeding or thrombosis  are present. The second obinutuzumab 
dose can be delayed by  [CONTACT_2006] -7. Any further delay in obinutuzumab dosing is to be discussed with 
the Medical Monitor.  
If no infusion -related reaction or an infusion -related reaction of Grade 1 occurred during the 
previous infusion and the final infusion rate was 100 mg/hr or faster, infusions can be started at a 
rate of 100 mg/hr and increased by 100 mg/hr increments ever y 30 minutes to a maximum of 400 
mg/hr. If an infusion -related reaction of Grade 2 or higher occurred during the previous infusion, 
administer at 50 mg/hr. The rate of infusion can be escalated in increments of 50 mg/hr every 30 
minutes to a maximum rate o f 400 mg/hr.  
See pharmacy  manual  for more details regarding administration of obinutuzumab.  
Infusion Related Reactions  If a subject experience  an infusion -related reaction (IRR), adjust the 
infusion as follows  
• Grade 4 (life -threatening): Stop infusion immediately and permanently discontinue 
obinutuzumab . This will have no impact on the subsequent administration of NAP 
/docetaxel, which should occur as scheduled.  
• Grade 3 (severe): Interrupt infusion and manage symptoms. Upon resolution of symptoms, 
consider restarting obinutuzumab  infusion at no more than half the previous rate (the rate 
being used at the time that the IRR reaction occurred), and if subject  does not experience 
any further IRR symptoms, infusion rate escalation may resume at the increments and 
intervals as appropriate for the treatment cycle dose. Permanently discontinue treatment if 
subject s experience a Grade 3 IRR at rechallenge.  
• Grade 1 –2 (mild to moderate): Reduce infusion rate or interrupt infusion and manage 
symptoms. Upon resolution of symptoms, continue or resume obinutuzumab  infusion, and 
if subject  does not experience any further IRR symptoms, infusion rate escalation may 
resume at the increments and intervals as appropriate for the treatment cycle dose.  
 
5.3.5 Stability of  Diluted Obinutuzumab   
For micr obiological stability, immediately use diluted obinutuzumab  infusion solution. If not used 
immediately, store in a refrigerator at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F) for up to 24 hours prior to use.

agents (e.g., tyrosine kinase inhibitors), checkpoint inhibitors, etc.  
• Systemic glucocorticoids equivalent to more than 10 mg/day of prednisone (with exceptions 
noted below).  Topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855], intranasal, inhalational and intra -ocular glucocorticoids are permitted.  
Intermittent, brief (less than 1 week) courses of pharmacologic doses of glucocorticoids are 
permitted for use as anti -emetics, premedications, severe AEs, in subject s with radiographic 
contrast allergies prior to radiographic procedures and for exacerbations of concomitant 
conditions such as asthma or COPD.  
• Palliative radiation to a target lesion; prior to administering any palliative radiation, the 
medical monitor should be consulted.  
• Other immunosuppressive agents, including (but not limited to), cyclosporine, mycophenolate, 
azathioprine, methotrexate, adalimumab, infliximab, vedolizumab, tofacitinib, dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458], 
rituximab, etc. 
• Live vaccines during protocol treatment and until B -cell recovery occurs ; vaccines derived 
from inactive viruses are permitted.  
• Strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 (a list of these agents may be found in Appendix 
14.5).  In addition, because of the possibility of transient release of cytokines following dosing 
with NAP which can suppress other CYP450 enzymes, subjects receiving  substrates of CYP 
enzymes for which small changes in concentration could lead to altered safety or efficacy 
should be monitored closely and have doses adjusted as necessary (Appendix 14.5) 
• The use of herbal and unap proved homeopathic remedies is strongly discouraged, as these 
agents may have subtle but important pharmacologic effects (e.g., effects on the cytochrome 
P450 system)  
Subject s who require any of the above treatments during the study will have protocol therapy 
discontinued and be scheduled for the  End of Treatment ( EOT) visit.  
All other intercurrent illnesses will be treated at the discretion of the Investigator  according to 
community standards of medical practice.  Agents commonly used to treat the complications of 
malignancy, such as non -steroidal anti -inflammatory agents, opi[INVESTIGATOR_2467], anti -depressants, 
anxiolytics, anti-emetics, antibiotics, hematopoietic growth factors  and bone agents (such as 
bisphosphonates and denosumab) are permitted , as are transfusions of blood products .  
Hematopoietic growth factors (e.g. G-CSF, erythropoietin) and approved COVID treatments (e.g.

Subjects will be contact[CONTACT_140055]. Upon 
arrival at the clinical site, subjects will be presented with the informed consent form (ICF) and all 
aspects of the study will be explained to them and the ir questions will be answered. Once subjects 
have provided their consent and signed ICF, they will begin the screening process and eligibility 
will be confirmed.  Once permission for enrollment is given the subject will be enrolled via an 
interactive web -based system.   
The study will be comprised of the following periods:  
• A Screening period within [ADDRESS_158958] dose  of obinutuzumab . 
• A Treatment period : as long as the combination of NAP and docetaxel is administered, cycles 
are of 21 -day treatment . When NAP is given as monotherapy and not earlier than cycle 7, 
cycles are of 28 -day treatment.  Treatment will continue until progression  or fulfillment of any 
of the reasons for protocol therapy discontinuation as outlined in Section 4.6 , for a maximum 
of up to 24 months from day 1 of therapy . If either NAP or docetaxel require discontinuation, 
the other drug will continue as monotherapy.  NAP will be administered in a dose of 10 
μg/kg/day on Days 1 -4 of cycles 1 -6, followed by [CONTACT_114501] , 75 mg/m2 on Day 5.  Starting 
Cycle 7, NAP will be administered on Day 1 only in a dose of 15 µg/kg (unless the dose was 
previously reduced due to toxicity) and docetaxel on Day 2, in 21 days treatment cycles. Once 
NAP is given as monotherapy and not earlier than C7, cycles wi ll be of 28 days of duration. 
In patients whose NAP dose was reduced due to toxicities during cycles 1 -6, NAP dose will 
not be further increased in cycle 7  and s tays the same as in the previous cycle . During these 
study visits, safety assessments,  PK/PD and immunogenicity markers will be collected,  and 
response assessments will be performed according to the schedule presented in Table 1 . The 
assessments which will be performed are also described in Section 7.  
• An End -of-Treatment ( EOT) visit will take place 30 days (±3) following the last dose 
administration to assess for safety parameters and other evaluations  and prior to start of a new 
anti-cancer treatment . 
The following Schedule s of Assessments describes all required study assessments and the 
timeframes in which these must be performed.  All visits must occur within the pre -defined 
windows outlined in this protocol.  
Guidance regarding how to manage  subjects exposed to COVID -19 and recommendations for 
the vaccine, can be found in  Appendix 14.7.

7.2 Safety Assessments  
7.2.1 Physical Examination  
A complete physical examination will be performed at Screening, on Day 1 of Cycle 1, as clinically 
indicated and at the End of Treatment ( EOT) visit.   
A symptom -directed physical exam, with focus on any areas of known neoplastic disease or on 
areas referable to any symptoms or AEs, will be performed on Day  -13, Days 5 and 15 of Cycle 1, 
Day 1 and Day 5 of each subsequent treatment cycle  and as clinically indicated . Symptom directed 
physical exam will be performed up to 72 hours prior to study drug administration.  
The complete physical examination will cover a careful assessment of all body systems, including 
the head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat and the respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], cardiovascular, GI, urogenital, 
musculoskeletal, neurological, dermatological, hematologic/lymphatic, and endocrine systems . 
Particular attention should be placed on th ose areas involved by [CONTACT_140056] . 
 
7.2.2 ECOG Performance Score  
The ECOG PS ( Appendix 14.3) will be assessed at the Screening visit, then on day 1 of each cycle  
and at the EOT.  
 
7.2.3 Vital Signs  
Vital signs (temperature, pulse , respi[INVESTIGATOR_140013]) 
will be measured as follows:   
• Time points related to NAP  administration start time :  
Vital signs will be obtained before NAP premedication administration , and at 15, 30  (+ 5 
min), 60 (+5 min), and 180 minutes (+ 15 min)  post-injection of NAP on cycle 1 (days 1 -
4) and cycle 2 day 1 (C2D1) only. On further treatment days  vital signs will be collected 
before NAP premedication and then at 15, 30 (+ 5 min) and 60 (+ 5) minutes post -injection  
of NAP, unless the subject  experienced any G3 or higher infusion related reactions 
previously , and therefore will continue monitoring up to 180 min (+15 min) post NAP 
administration . Time points related to Docetaxel administration start time :  
Vital signs will be obtained before Docetaxel treatment  on day 5 of each cycle.  
• Time points related to obinutuzumab  administration start time:  
Vital signs will be obtained before obinutuzumab  premedication  administration, then every  
15 (+ 5 min) for the first hour of infusion, then every 30 minutes (± 5 min) for the remainder 
of the infusion and then every 30 minutes (± 5 min) for 1 hour after the end of the infusion .  
• Vital signs will be also performed on day 15 of cycle 1, and at EOT visit.  
• Weight  will be measured at the start of each treatment cycle  and at the E OT visit . The 
calculation of the dose per subject weight should be done on the basis of subject weight on 
the day of treatment. In sites restricted by [CONTACT_966]’s procedures the dose can be calculated 
on the basis of subject weight obtained within [ADDRESS_158977] 's weight should NOT  be rounded off to the 
NeoTX  
Protocol NT -NAP -102-1 
Protocol Version –8.[ADDRESS_158978] kg value but rather recorded with 1 digit after the decimal point, for example, 70.5 
kg, 60.4, 77.0 kg etc. However, after multiplying the weight by [CONTACT_140049] 
(µg/kg), the final dose (in µg) should be rounded off, for example, 120.5 µ g will be rounded 
to 121 µg and 150.4 µg will be rounded to 150 µg.  
• Height  will be measured at the screening visit  
 
Vital signs will be measured in supi[INVESTIGATOR_140014]. A special attention 
should be given to cytokine release syndrome (CRS). See instructions below.  
 
Evaluation of cytokine  release syndrome  (CRS):  
The toxicities related to CRS ( 23) should be carefully monitored during the entire treatment period 
and specifically on days of N AP dosing.   See Appendix 14.[ADDRESS_158979] cycle and 3 hours on each subsequent 
cycle to monitor for signs and symptoms of CRS.  
In addition, subjects and their family members/caregivers  should be educated on potential CRS 
symptoms such as fever, dyspnea, confusion, aphasia, dysphasia, somnolence, encephalopathy, 
ataxia, or tremor. Subjects or their family members/caregivers should be instructed to immediately 
contact [CONTACT_140057].

7.2.4 ECG  
A 12 -lead ECG will be taken for each participant at Screening,  and at the EOT visit.  Additional 
ECG could be done during the study if clinically indicated . At minimum, the following ECG 
parameters will be recorded: heart rate (HR), and PR, QT and QRS and QTcF  intervals . In addition, 
a determination of whether the ECG was normal, abnormal but not clinically significant, or 
abnormal AND clinically significant will be recorded in the eCRF.   
 
7.2.5 Laboratory Determinations  
All safety lab evaluations will be performed by a local lab.  All laboratory results will be reviewed 
by [CONTACT_140058], abnormal but not clinically 
significant, or abnormal AND clinically significant.  In the latter case, the laboratory findings 
should be recorded as adverse events.  
Complete blood count  
Blood will be collected for complete blood count s (CBC) at the Screening visit, on Day -12, on 
Days 1, 4 and 15 of Cycle 1  and then on Day 1 only of every cycle thereafter involving combination 
or NAP/ docetaxel  monotherapy treatment, if applicable (when NAP/docetaxel is discontinued due 
to toxicity or intercurrent medical conditions) . A CBC will also be obtained on the 30-day EOT 
visit. A time window for collection of CBC is available of up to [ADDRESS_158980] be known and within acceptable range prior to dosing.  
The CBC assessment will include a determination of hemogl obin, hematocrit, platelet count, white 
blood cells (WBC), and differential (to include percentage of each white blood cell ).  
 
B cell counts    
B cell counts samples will be collected on Day -13, C1D1, and day [ADDRESS_158981] it in the 
next scheduled visit (results should be captured in the EDC under an unscheduled visit).  If B cell 
level increased  back to normal level  at any timepoint during the study, additional samples for PK, 
ADAs, HAMA and Nab will be collected in the following visit . Results are not required to be 
available prior to treatment. This sample should be analyzed at local laboratory  according to 
Appendix 14.8. 
Serum chemistry   
Blood will be collected for s erum chemistry assessments at the Screening visit, on Days 1, 4 and 
15 of Cycle 1 , and then on Day 1 of every cycle thereafter . A serum chemistry sample will also be 
obtained on the 30 -day EOT. A time window for collection of CBC is available of up to 72 hours 
prior to study treatment on Day 1 of each cycle  and up to 24 hours prior to Cycle 1 Day 4, but after

gamma -glutamyl transferase (GGT), alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, Lactate dehydrogenase 
(LDH ), calcium, magnesium, phosphorous, total protein, albumin, and uric acid.   
Coagulation Panel  
A coagulation panel, consisting of an international normalized ratio (INR) and activated partial

Urine:  A urine pregnancy test will be performed in women of child -bearing potential (WOCBP) 
only, up to 7 days  prior to dosing  of obinutuzumab on Day (-13).  
Blood:  A serum pregnancy test will be performed if a confirmation pregnancy test is necessary.   
Thyroid Panel  
A thyroid panel, to include a free T4, T3 and TSH will be performed during Screening , day [ADDRESS_158985] will be followed every 3 months up to resolution 
or starting a new anti -cancer treatment.  
Viral Serologies  
Viral serologies to include HBsAg, HCV antibody and HCV antibody to be performed at

and mandatory brain MRI at screening (additional brain MRI will be performed during the study 
only if  indicated ). CT scan of the brain will also be acceptable if MRI is not available. MRI should 
only be used for subject s with a contraindication to receive contrast agents . In case s where CT 
contrast -agents are unavailable , a non -contrast CT should be used for chest and pelvis and MRI 
with contrast is recommended  for abdo men (for better assessment of a specific region  by [CONTACT_140059] e.g. for liver lesions ).  
Other specialized imaging or other techniques may also be appropriate for individual case. For 
example, while PET scans are not considered adequate to measure lesions, PET -CT scans may be 
used providing that the measures are obtained from the CT scan and the CT scan is of identical 
diagnostic quality to a diagnostic CT (with IV and oral contrast) , and only if a baseline PET -CT is 
available . An initial tumor imaging will be performed within the Screening period  (brain and 
CAP) . Scans performed as part of routine clinical management will be acceptable for use as the 
screening scan if they are of diagnostic quality  and have been performed within three (3) weeks  
prior to  D-13 obinutuzumab pretreatment . Ongoing study imaging will be performed at the end of 
cycle 2 (45 days ± 7 days) and every [ADDRESS_158987] 24 weeks and then every 9 weeks (± 7 
days) thereafter. This schedule should be maintained even if cycles are delayed.  Confirmatory 
scans will be performed after 6 weeks (± 7 days)  during the first 24 weeks and every 9 weeks 
thereafter . Any imaging performed for subjects without confirmed progression at early 
termination, diagnostic imaging/response assessments should continue every 6 (±1) weeks for the 
first 24 weeks and then every 9 weeks (± 7 days) thereafter , until confirmed progression of disease 
or initiation of alternate therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. If a subject has a response or stable disease, they can be 
permitted to continue until progression.  
As NAP is known to induce an inflammatory reaction in the tumor, pseudo -progression may be 
observed and therefore, in patients who demonstrate objective progression but who are clinically 
stable, 1 -2 additional treatment cycle(s) of NAP/docetaxel may be administered beyond 
progression at the discretion of the Investigator, followed by a confirmat ory imaging after 6 weeks

7.7 End of Treatment/Early Termination Visit  
Specific assessments and procedures to be performed for the End of Treatment/Early Termination 
visit are listed in Table 2 . The End of Treatment visit will occur 30 days (±3) from the last dose of 
protocol therapy  and prior to start of a new anti -cancer treatment . 
7.8 Long Term Follow -Up 
All subjects will be followed for survival , by [CONTACT_140060],  for up to 6 months (± 7 days) 
following treatment completion  of the last subject in the trial.  
Subjects without confirmed progression at early termination, diagnostic imaging/response 
assessments should continue every 6 (±1) weeks  in the first 24 weeks and every 9 weeks thereafter,  
until confirmed progression of disease or initiation of alternate therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Thyroid panel will also 
continue for subjects on study every 3 months for 6 months after study drug discontinuation.  
7.9 Unscheduled Visits  
Unscheduled visits are those visits that will occur between regularly scheduled visits and will be 
performed in order to assess a previously noted adverse event, abnormal/significant laboratory 
values, and/or clinical findings. In such cases, the patient w ill be contact[CONTACT_140061]. Only focused assessments are foreseen for these 
visits.

outcome of the AE and to assess whether it meets the criteria for classification as a serious adverse 
event (SAE) requiring immediate notification to the Sponsor or its designated representative.  For 
all AEs, sufficient information should be obtained by [CONTACT_140062], which must be assessed by [CONTACT_737] . Follow  up by [CONTACT_140063], retu rn to a baseline state or stabilize.

relationship with the treatment or usage.  An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and/or 
unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally 
associated with the use of an investigational medicinal product, whether  related to the 
investigational medicinal product. TEAEs are defined as events that emerge during treatment 
having been absent pre-treatment or  worsen relative to the pre -treatment state.  
All adverse events, including observed or volunteered problems, complaints, or symptoms, are to 
be recorded on the appropriate eCRF , as described in section 8.1 .

Page 85 of 113 Examples of AEs include but are not limited to:  
• All suspected adverse medication reactions including:  
o Abnormalities in physiological testing or physical examination findings that require 
clinical intervention or further investigation (beyond ordering a repeat [confirmatory] 
test).  
o Laboratory abnormalities that require clinical intervention or further investigation 
(beyond ordering a repeat [confirmatory] test) unless they were associated with an 
already reported clinical event.  Laboratory abnormalities associated with a clinical 
event (e.g., elevated liver enzymes in a subject  with jaundice) are to be described 
separately unless the underlying pathophysiological cause is known  
o Clinically significant symptoms and signs  
• All reactions from medication overdose, abuse, withdrawal, hypersensitivity, or toxicity.  
• Seemingly unrelated illnesses, including the worsening of a pre -existing illness   
• Injury or accidents Note : if a medical condition is known to have caused the injury or 
accident, the medical condition and the accident should be reported as two separate AEs. 
The outcome of the accident should be recorded under Comments.  
• Progression/worsening of underlying disease (progression of the malignancy under 
evaluation should not be considered as AE).   
 
Pre-existing Conditions  
A pre -existing condition (i.e. a disorder other than cancer present before the AE reporting period 
started and noted on the pre -treatment medical history form) is not to be reported as an AE unless 
the condition worsens or epi[INVESTIGATOR_140016].  Planned 
or elective surgical procedures for pre -existing conditions that have not worsened are not TEAEs. 
However, any complication that occurs during a planned or elective surgery is a TEAE ( Note : If 
the event meets the crite ria for a SAE, such as an extended hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], it will be considered 
an SAE). Conditions leading to unplanned surgical procedures may also be TEAEs.  
 
New Cancers  
The development of a new cancer should be regarded as an SAE. New primary cancers are those 
that are not the primary reason for the administration of protocol therapy  and have been identified 
after the subject ’s inclusion in this study.  
 
  
NeoTX  
Protocol NT -NAP -102-1 
Protocol Version –8.[ADDRESS_158993] (AOSI)  
Given the expected immunostimulatory effects of the study treatment, special attention should be 
paid to immune -related adverse events . Immune -related AEs (irAEs) will be graded based on 
CTCAE.  
In case the AOSI  is classified as an SAE, an SAE report will be completed, signed and sent via 
email to the Sponsor or Sponsor ’s designee.  
 
8.3 Unexpected Adverse Event  
An adverse event is considered "unexpected" if it is not listed in the Investigator  Brochure or is 
not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed; or, if an Investigator  Brochure is not 
required or available, is not consistent with the risk information described in the general 
investigational plan or elsewhere in the current application, as amended; or if a marketed product, 
not described as above in the full prescribing informatio n, package insert  or summary of product 
characteristics for  an approved product.  
 
8.4 Severity Assessment  
The term “severe” is used to describe the intensity of an AE; the event itself could be of relatively 
minor clinical significance ( e.g., ‘severe’ headache). This is not the same as a “serious” AE.  
The severity of the AE will be graded by [CONTACT_140065], v. 5.0 (the NCI CTCAE files can be accessed online at the following URL:  
https://ctep.cancer.gov/protocoldevelopment/electronic_applications/docs/CTCAE_v5_Quick_R
eference_5x7.pdf  
If there is not a specific NCI CTCAE grading scale for an AE, the severity will be characterized 
as mild, moderate, severe, life -threatening  or fatal  according to the following definitions:  
• Grade 1 (mild) events are usually transient in nature and do not interfere with the  
subject ’s daily activities.  
• Grade 2 (moderate) events introduce as low level of inconvenience or concern to the  
subject  and may interfere with daily activities.  
• Grade 3 (severe) events interrupt the subject ’s usual daily activities.  
• Grade 4 (life -threatening)

8.5 Causality Assessment  
The Investigator ’s assessment of causality must be provided for all AEs (serious and non -serious); 
the Investigator  must record the causal relationship in the eCRF, as appropriate, and report such 
an assessment in accordance with the SAE reporting requirements, if applicable. An Investigator ’s 
causality assessment is the determination of whether there exists a reasonable possibility that the 
investigational product caused or contributed to an AE; generally, the facts (evidence) or 
arguments to suggest a cau sal relationship should be provided.  
In addition, if the Investigator  determines that an AE is associated with a study procedure, the 
Investigator  must record this causal relationship in the source documents and eCRF, as appropriate, 
and report such an assessment in accordance with the AE reporting requirements, if applicable.  
The Investigator  will make a judgment regarding the relationship of the AE to study treatment, as 
defined below.  
Causality:  the relationship of each AE to study treatment will be defined as unrelated or related 
to study treatment using the following definitions:  
o Unrelated:  There is little or no possibility that the study treatment caused the reported 
AE; and other factor(s) including concurrent illnesses, progression and expression of the 
disease state, concurrent medications, or a reaction to concurrent medications appear t o 
explain the AE.  
o Related:  There exists at least a reasonable possibility that the study treatment caused or 
contributed to the AE; an inability to identify an alternate etiology for an AE should not, 
by [CONTACT_5071], justify a related attribution.  
 
8.6 Serious Adverse Events  
Treatment -emergent SAEs will be recorded at each visit throughout the study on the appropriate eCRF. 
Any SAEs occurring between (and including) Screening and Baseline visits will be recorded in the Medical 
History eCRF, as long as treatment has not been initiated.  
A serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence at any dose that:  
• Results in death  
• Is life-threatening (immediate risk of death)  
• Requires in-subject  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (substantial disruption of the ability 
to conduct normal life functions)  
• Results in  a congenital anomaly/birth defect

Page 88 of 113 • Is an important medical event that doesn’t fulfill any of the above criteria  
Medical and scientific judgment is exercised in determining whether an event is an important 
medical event.  An important medical event may not be immediately life -threatening and/or result 
in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  However, if it is determined that the event may jeopardize the subject 
or may require intervention to prevent one of the other SAE outcomes, the important medical event 
should be reported as serious.  
Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic 
bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; development 
of drug dependency or drug abuse  or a new malignancy . 
Progression/worsening of underlying disease (progression of the malignancy under evaluation 
should not be considered as serious adverse event).   
 
8.7 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_140017] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_140018] 24 hours or any prolongation of an existing admission.  An emergency room visit 
does not necessarily constitute a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; however, the event leading to the emergency 
room visit should be assessed for medical importance.  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4592]:  
• Admission to a r ehabilitation facilit y

• Admission for treatment of a preexisting condition not associated with the development of 
a new AE or with a worsening of the preexisting condition (e.g., for workup of persistent 
pretreatment laboratory abnormality)

Suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) are SAEs that are unexpected by [CONTACT_140066]. All S[LOCATION_003]Rs will be collected and reported to the regulatory authorities and relevant 
ethics committees in accordance with local pharmacovigilance requirements.

supporting documentation (e.g., subject  discharge summary or autopsy reports), should be 
transmitted or emailed to The Sponsor  or its pharmacovigilance designee(s) at the Fax or email 
address above.  
The Sponsor  must report all fatal or life -threatening SAEs to regulatory authorities in an expedited 
manner within 7 calendar days of being made aware of the event; serious adverse event reporting 
to regulatory authorities and all participating investigators will be conducted by N eoTX in 
accordance with 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 312.[ADDRESS_158995]’s

additional tests may be taken at the discretion of the Investigator . Certain long -term AEs related 
to therapy cannot be followed until resolution within the setting of this study. In these cases, 
follow -up will be the responsibility of the treating physician.  
All TEAEs will be reported on the AE page(s) of the eCRF.  It should be noted that the form for 
collection  and reporting  of SAE information is not the same as the AE eCRF.  Where the same data 
are collected, the forms must be completed in a consistent manner.  For example, the same AE term 
should be used on both forms.  AEs should be reported using concise medical terminology on the 
eCRFs as well as on the form for collection and reporting of SAE information.

AEs. The outcome of all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, ectopic 
pregnancy, normal birth or congenital abnormal ity) should be followed up and documented even 
if the subject  was discontinued from the study.  
If a study subject or study subject’s partner becomes or is found to be pregnant during the study 
subject’s treatment with the investigational product, the Investigator  must submit this information 
to The Sponsor  on a Pregnancy Reporting From , regardless of whether an SAE has occurred as a 
consequence of this exposure.   
The Investigator  will follow the pregnancy until completion (or until pregnancy termination) and 
notify The Sponsor  of the outcome.  In the case of a live birth, the structural integrity of the neonate 
can be assessed at the time of birth.  In the event of a termination, the reason(s) for termination 
should be specified and, if clinically possible, the structural integrity of the terminated fetus should 
be assessed by [CONTACT_4692] (unless pre -procedure test findings are conclusive for a 
congenital anomaly and the findings are reported).

the procedures for reporting SAEs.  
Additional information about pregnancy outcomes that are reported as SAEs are as follows:  
• Spontaneous abortion includes miscarriage and missed abortion  
• Neonatal deaths that occur within [ADDRESS_159001] dose of NAP and/or durvalumab therapy.  
Pregnancy of a male  subject ’s partner is not considered to be an AE. Where a report of pregnancy is 
received, prior to obtaining information about the pregnancy, the Investigator  must obtain the consent of 
the subject’s partner.  Once consent is obtained, the Investigator  will provide the study subject with the 
Pregnant Partner Release of Information Form to deliver to his partner  and document in the source 
documents that the subject was given th is form .

the date of the first dose until [ADDRESS_159002] experiencing a recurrence of the same AE(s) at the same grade or greater, or a subject 
experiencing a recurrence of the same SAE, a consultation between the Sponsor and Investigator  
should be conducted to determine whether the subject should continue on therapy . A determination 
will then be made as to whether the subject should have NAP  discontinued, docetaxel 
discontinued, or both agents discontinued based on the nature of the adverse event.  
Withdrawal due to AEs should be distinguished from withdrawal due to other causes, according 
to the definition of AE noted earlier, and recorded on the appropriate AE eCRF page.

Safety Population : includes all subjects who received a t least one day of any study treatment 
(including pre -treatment, o binutuzumab) .

(iCR, iPR, iSD ) complete response ( iCR), partial response ( iPR), stable disease ( iSD), 
unconfirmed progressive disease ( iUPD) and confirmed progressive disease (iCPD) . Any 
subject with no evaluable response assessment at a scheduled time -point will be assigned a 
response of not evaluable (NE) at that time -point.  Best overall response is the highest overall 
response achieved by [CONTACT_140068].  Subjects with no evaluable response assessment on 
study will be scored as not evaluable (NE).  Objective response rate (ORR) is defined as the 
proportion of subject s who achieve either a n iCR or a n iPR. Immunotherap y may result in 
infiltration of  immune cells leading to transient increase in the size in malignant lesions, or 
undetectable  lesions  becoming detectable. The criteria are identical to those of RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_159007] 
requires the confirmation of progression , which should be done after 6 weeks (± 7 days) during 
the first 24 weeks and every 9 weeks thereafter.  
 
The ORR , with corresponding 95% confidence intervals, will be computed.   
Disease control rate is the proportion of subjects demonstrating CR, PR, or SD.  The analysis of 
disease control rate will be similar to ORR.  
Duration of response (DOR), in subjects with CR or PR, is the time from the first observation of 
aCR or PR to the first documented PD.  Duration of response of subjects with no PD will be 
censored at the date of last evaluable response assessment.  
Distributions of DOR will be estimated using the Kaplan -Meier method.  The median DOR will be 
estimated  as well .  
Progression -free survival (PFS) is the time from first day of study drug treatment (obinutuzumab) 
to the first time of documented PD or death for any cause.  PFS of living subjects with no PD will 
be censored at the date last evaluable response assessment.  
Distributions of PFS times will be estimated using the Kaplan -Meier product -limit method.  The 
median PFS times with 2 -sided 95% confidence intervals, as well of PFS  rates at 6  and 12 months, 
will be estimated.   
Overall survival (OS) is the time from first day of study drug treatment (obinutuzumab) to death 
for any cause.  OS of living subjects will be censored at the date last known to be alive  and will be 
assessed up to [ADDRESS_159008] in the trial . Analysis of 
OS will be similar to that of PFS.

Safety analyses will be performed on the safety population.   
Adverse events (AEs) will be graded by [CONTACT_140069]

administration of any study treatment  and prior to start of a new anti -cancer treatment . Clinically 
significant laboratory abnormalities, namely tests that result in treatment modification and/or

It is the responsibility of the Investigator  to have prospective approval of the study protocol, 
protocol amendments, informed consent documents, and other relevant documents, e .g., 
recruitment advertisements, if applicable, from the IRB/EC. All correspondence with the IRB/EC 
must  be retained in the Investigator  file. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_1099]/EC approvals should be forwarded to The 
Sponsor  or its designee . 
The only circumstance in which an amendment may be initiated prior to IRB/EC approval is wh en 
the change is necessary to eliminate an apparent immediate hazard to the subjects. In that event, 
the Investigator  must notify the IRB/EC and The Sponsor  in writing immediately after the 
implementation.  
Before the start of the study, the Investigator  (or Sponsor where required) will provide the IRB /EC 
with current and complete copi[INVESTIGATOR_23747]:  
- final protocol and, if applicable, amendments  
- Sponsor -approved ICF (and any updates or any other written materials to be provided to the 
subjects)  
- Sponsor -approved subject recruiting materials

- information regarding funding, name [CONTACT_19618], institutional affiliations, other potential 
conflicts of interest, and incentives for subjects  
- any other documents that the IRB /EC may require to fulfill its obligation  
 
This study will be undertaken only after the IRB /EC has given full written approval of the final 
protocol and amendments (if any), the ICF(s) and updates (if any), applicable recruiting materials, 
and any other written information to be provided to the subjects, and the Sponsor has received a 
copy of this approval. This approval letter must be dated and must clearly identify the IEC/IRB 
and the documents being approved.  
During the study, the Investigator  (or Sponsor where required) will send the following documents 
and updates to the IRB /EC for its review and approval, where appropriate:  
- protocol amendments

12.2 Records Retention  
To enable evaluations and/or audits from regulatory authorities or the Sponsor, the Investigator  
agrees to keep records, including the identity of all participating subjects (sufficient information 
to link records, e.g., eCRF, study source documentation and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097]), all originally signed 
informed consent forms,  safety reporting forms, source documents, detailed records of treatment 
disposition, and adequate documentation of relevant correspondence (e.g., letters, meeting 
minutes, and telephone cal l reports). The records should be retained by [CONTACT_140079], according to local regulations, or as specified in the Clinical Study 
Agreement (CSA), whichever is longer.  
If the Investigator  becomes unable for any reason to continue to retain study records for the 
required period (e.g., retirement, relocation), the Sponsor should be prospectively notified.  The 
study records must be transferred to a designee acceptable to the Sponsor, such as another

Page 113 of 113 Staining Procedure : 
• Adequately mix the sample before starting. Mix gently by [CONTACT_140081] 8 -10 
times until all cells are thoroughly suspended  
• Add 5 μL CD45, and 5 μL CD19 into a 15mL tube  
• Pi[INVESTIGATOR_8459] 100 μL of blood  
• Incubate tube at RT in the dark for 30 minutes  
• Add 1 mL Versalyse  
• Vortex  
• Incubate tube at RT for 10 minutes  
• Centrifuge for 5 minutes 400g  
• Decant supernatant  
• Add 3 mL PBS and centrifuge for 5 minutes 400g  
• Decant supernatant  
• Add 600 μL PBS and vortex for 2 -3 seconds  
• Move the cells suspension into a proper 12X75 tube  
• Samples are now ready for analysis on FACS Navius  
• The FACS Navius is calibrated by [CONTACT_140082]  
• The analysis will give the percentage of B cells out of Lympho absolute number  
• In order to get the lympho absolute number perform a CBC count from the EDTA tube  
 
Results values:  
The results of the B -cells should be presented in percentages and absolute numbers. Please 
include in the report the result units (% and cells/microL) and the normal range.

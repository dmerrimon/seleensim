The second phase of the study is designed to prov ide independent validation of the relationships 
observed in the exploratory analys es of the first phase.  In pa rticular, the goal of the second 
phase is to confirm the relationship between 18F-AV-1451 uptake in the brain as measured by 
[CONTACT_272734] l ongitudinal follow up. 
 
Eligibility: 
Each of the groups is comprised of specific inclus ion and exclusion criteria to determine patient 
eligibility.  See Section 5.3, Selection of Subjects. 
Study Design: This is a phase [ADDRESS_333342] oratory/hypothesis generating phase and a 
confirmatory/validation phase, which will ha ve separate subjects and analyses.   
All subjects will provide informed consen t before starting any study procedures.  
For both the Exploratory and Confirmatory Phas es, screening assessments may take place over 
several days and will include demographic information, cognitive testing, safety assessment, 
and MRI, including both volumetri c and standard clinical sequen ces.  Raters administering the 
cognitive testing will  be blinded to the 18F-AV-1451 scans for subjects  in the Confirmatory 
Cohort. Subjects who qualify for the study will return to the clinic at  a later date for a florbetapir 
F 18 PET imaging session and an 18F-AV-1451 PET imaging session.  Some subjects, who are ≥

Assessments and Endpoints: 
Each group will have a screening visit(s), a florbetapir F 18 PET imaging visit, a 18F-AV-1451 
PET imaging visit, and follow-up phone calls after each imaging visit.  
Florbetapir F 18 PET Imaging Session: 
For the florbetapir F 18 PET imaging session, subjects will receive a single  IV bolus injection 
target dose of 370 MBq (10 mCi) of florbetapi r F 18.  At 50 minutes following injection, a 
continuous 10-minute brain scan (2 acquisitio ns of 5 minute duration) will begin.   
18F-AV-1451 PET Imaging Session:   
For the 18F-AV-1451 PET imaging session, subjects will receive a single IV bolus injection 
target dose of 370 MBq (10 mCi) of 18F-AV-[ADDRESS_333346] information about any ne w adverse events.  If both of these days are 
not business days, the follow-up phone call can occur the follow ing business day. 
In the Exploratory longitudina l component, subjects who are ≥ [ADDRESS_333347] of cognitive a ssessments and updated medical history and 
concomitant medications. No PET imaging or MRI is planned at the follow-up visits in the 
Confirmatory Cohort. Additional assessments that w ill be performed at each visit are detailed in 
Section 7.1.

 Statistical Methods:   
In the exploratory study phase, descriptive sta tistics will be applied to describe the 18F-AV-[ADDRESS_333348] the difference between clinical diagnosis groups. Analyses will be 
conducted to assess the relationship among 18F-AV-1451 uptake, cognitive function 
measurements, and other collected biomarkers. Longitudinal data from the exploratory study 
phase will be assessed periodically to determine the relationships between various 18F-AV-1451 
imaging parameters (e.g., composite and regi onal SUVr, voxel based statistics and visual 
interpretation) and the change from baseline in  the various cognitive and functional assessments.  
These data will be used to generate hypot heses regarding the relationship between 18F-AV-1451 
PET tau imaging and cognitive/functional change th at will be formally incorporated into an 
analysis plan and tested in the confirmatory phase of the study.

Page [ADDRESS_333354] the potential  to aid in the diagnos is of patients with 
cognitive impairment who are being evalua ted for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) (Dubois, 
2010; McKhann, 2011).  Positron emission tomogr aphy (PET) ligands such as florbetapir 
F 18 (Wong, 2010) may provide a minimally inva sive estimate of cortical beta amyloid 
(Aβ) neuritic plaque deposition, a hallmark pathology, and a required element for the 
evaluation of AD neuropathologic diagnosis (Hyman 2012).  Multiple studies comparing 
amyloid PET scans to histopathologic assessm ent of amyloid burden, in subjects for 
whom biopsy samples were available or who came to autopsy after receiving a PET 
amyloid scan, support the relationship between PET amyloid imaging results and cortical neuritic plaque density (Clark 2011, 2012; Leinonen, 2008; Sojkova, 2011; Kantarci, 
2011; Burack, 2010).  The largest of these st udies (Clark 2012) demonstrated a high 
sensitivity and specificity for florbetapir PET to discriminate subjec ts with subsequent 
autopsy findings of no or sparse neuritic plaques (amyloid negative) from those with 
moderate to frequent pl aques (amyloid positive). 
The ability to image brain amyloid with com pounds such as florbetapir is an important 
advance for diagnosis of neurological disease.   An amyloid negative florbetapir PET scan 
indicates the absence of a hallm ark pathology and is inconsistent with a diagnosis of AD.  
However, because amyloid is believed to accumulate very early in the disease process (Jack et al., 2010) and may be present in othe r diseases or in clinically normal elderly 
subjects (Sperling et al. 2011;  Price and Morris, 1999), the density or distribution of 
amyloid in subjects with a positive scan is  not associated with Alzheimer’s disease 
severity, has not been established to predict rate of future deterioration and has not been 
established as a tool to predict or monitor response to therapy. 
In contrast to A β neuritic plaques, the density an d distribution of phosphorylated tau, 
aggregated in neurofibrillar y tangles, increases with AD-re lated cognitive impairment 
and correlates with neurodege neration (Dickson et al., 1997 ; Duyckaerts et a., 1987).  
Thus, a PET imaging agent that binds to phos phorylated tau has poten tial application as a 
biomarker for disease severity/neurodegenera tion and may be useful both for selecting 
patients for therapy and for monitoring di sease progression in therapeutic trials. 
18F-AV-1451 (originally named [F-18]T807 by [CONTACT_176085]) has been developed as a positron emitting radiopharmaceutical for in 
vivo imaging of tau protein aggregates (Xia et  al., 2013).  Autoradiography results using 
tissue sections from human brai ns showed a strong signal in the grey matter of cortical 
slices from tau positive brains but weak or no binding in tau negative, A β positive, or tau 
and A negative tissue.  Scatchard analysis ba sed on this heterogeneous autoradiography 
assay yielded an estimated K d of 15nM. A saturation binding experiment using purified 
Paired Helical Fragment Tau isolated  brains of AD patients yielded a K d value of 0.[ADDRESS_333355] 
common central nervous system (CNS) targets and no clinically rele vant inhibition was 
seen.   AV-1451 was positive in the i n vitro hERG assay; however, in vivo  cardiovascular 
safety pharmacology assessments in dogs showed no evidence of QT prolongation at doses up to 50x the intended maximum hu man dose (MHD).  Nonetheless, until 
LY3191748

Page [ADDRESS_333356] levels (NOAE Ls) were the highest 
doses tested (150x MHD for singl e, 50x MHD for repeat).   
Potential genotoxicity of non-radioactive AV-1451 was tested in both in vitro and in vivo  
assays.  In the in vitro  assays, AV-1451 tested positive for potential genotoxicity.   
However, in the in vivo  rat micronucleus assay at doses up to 750x MHD (scaled 
allometrically), AV-[ADDRESS_333357] 
systems. In vivo , AV-1451 is cleared rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375]; however, the in vitro  experiments employ 
static, prolonged exposure of cells to high c oncentrations of the te st article. While the in 
vitro  data show the potentia l for genotoxicity, the in vivo  data provide assurance that 
genotoxicity is unlikely to occu r at clinically-releva nt doses for human diagnostic studies. 
18F-AV-1451 has been evaluated in two hu man studies under the exploratory IND 
(Chien, et. al).  Adverse events reported have  been mild and transient; none have been 
considered related to 18F-AV-[ADDRESS_333358] that 18F-AV-1451 is eliminated from norma l brain yielding only a diffuse 
pattern of background activity (Figure 1), whereas a regionally-specific gray matter distribution is observed in subjects with high probability AD (Figure 2).

Human dosimetry has been obtained in nine  subjects.  Generally, the radiotracer 
distribution was consistent among the subjects and showed rapid hepato biliary clearance.  
There were three organs that received es timated doses higher than 0.05 mSv/MBq. The 
organ that received the largest estimate d dose was the upper la rge intestinal wall 
(0.0962 ± 0. 0134 mSv/MBq), followed by [CONTACT_176086].  The 
Effective Dose was 0.0241 ± 0.0016 mSv/MBq. Th is results in an estimated Effective 
Dose of 8.92 mSv for an anticipated 370 MBq (10 mCi) injection and is comparable to 
the effective dose of approved 18F-labeled compounds such as fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) 
and florbetapir F 18 injection. 
The overarching goal of this protocol is to  further investigate the spectrum of PET 
imaging results with 18F -AV-1451 in patients with cognitive decline and healthy 
controls.  To accomplish this goal, the protocol will investigate 18F-AV-1451 results in 
younger and older controls and patients with cognitive complaints ranging from mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI) to mild and moderate Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Additionally, this protocol will investigate correlations between 
18F-AV-[ADDRESS_333359] the relationship between 
18F-AV-1451 PET imaging and cognitive decline over the 18 month study period. 
2. TRIAL OBJECTIVES 
This study will be conducted in two phases, an exploratory phase and a confirmatory/validation phase, which will have separate subjects and analyses.  The first 
phase of this study will be comprised of a cross-sectional component and a longitudinal 
component. The second (confirmatory/validation)  phase will focus on the relationship of 
baseline PET tau images to change in longitudinal clinical measure.

 5. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN 
5.1. Overall Design and Plan of Trial 
This is a phase 2 cross-sectional and long itudinal observational study that will evaluate 
imaging characteristics of 18F-AV-1451 in control subjects and patients with MCI and 
AD. This study will be conducted in two phase s, an exploratory/hypothesis generating 
phase and a confirmatory/validation phase , which will have separate subjects and 
analyses. Approximately 230 subjects will be enrolled in the Exploratory Phase of the 
study: 80 cognitively healthy volunteers, 80 subjects with MCI, 70 subjects with AD. 
Approximately 20 cognitively healthy volunteers will be ≥20 to ≤ 40 years of age. 
Approximately 60 cognitively healthy volunteers will be ≥ 50 years of age and will be 
distributed across age deciles (50-59, 60-69, 70-79 and >80). Approximately [ADDRESS_333367] clinical sequences.  Raters 
administering the cognitive te sting will be blinded to the 18F-AV-1451 scans for subjects 
in the Confirmatory Cohort. Subjects who qualify for the study will undergo both a 
florbetapir F 18 PET imaging session and an 18F-AV-1451 PET imaging session.  Some 
subjects, who are ≥ [ADDRESS_333368] the option to 
participate in cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_872] (CSF) collection by [CONTACT_259778] (LP).  
Subjects who are ≥ 50 years of age will return for follow-up visits at 9 (+/-2) months and 
18 (+/-2) months following the initial 18F-AV-[ADDRESS_333369] an a dditional resting state 
functional (rsf)MRI sequence s can in addition to the volumet ric and standard clinical 
sequences at both the screening MRI and follow-up MRIs. All follow-up procedures 
should be collected within the specified vi sit window (See Secti on 7.1.4). Subjects or 
their designated decision maker will be contact[CONTACT_10073] [ADDRESS_333370] updated conc omitant medications and medical 
history. Avid personnel will be blinded to the Confirmatory Phase longitudinal cognitive data. 
Avid personnel will also remain blinde d to the PET scans (both florbetapir and 
18F-AV-
1451) performed on subjects in the Confirmato ry Phase with the exception of periodic 
quality assurance (QA) assessments of a random subset of image data (not to exceed 20% 
unless issues identified that warrant additional review). These QA reviews will serve to 
ensure image quality and data integrity for the scans collected and managed by [CONTACT_272737].  Avid staff performing the PET scan QA assessment will not be 
aware of diagnostic group or c ognitive test scores for the s ubjects/images being reviewed.

 Florbetapir F 18 PET Imaging Session:  
For the florbetapir F 18 PET imaging session, an  intravenous catheter will be placed for 
IV administration of Florbeta pir F 18 Injection.  Subjects w ill receive a single IV bolus 
injection target dose of 370 MBq (10 mCi) of Florbetapir F 18 Injection followed by a 
saline flush.  At approximately 50 minutes following injection, a continuous 10-minute 
brain scan (2 acquisitions of 5 minute duration) will begin.   
Adverse events will be continuously monitore d during the florbetapir F [ADDRESS_333371] information about any 
new adverse events.  If both of these days  are not business days, the follow-up phone call 
can occur the following business day. 
 
18F-AV-1451 PET Imaging Session(s):  
For the 18F-AV-1451 PET imaging session(s), an in travenous catheter will be placed for 
IV administration of 18F-AV-1451 Injection.  Subjects will receive a single IV bolus 
injection target dose of 370 MBq (10 mCi) of 18F-AV-[ADDRESS_333372] dose, a continuous  20-minute brain scan (4 
acquisitions of 5-minute duration) will be ob tained. If at any point during the imaging 
session it is determined that the subject is not ab le to continue, or that  it is not in the best 
interest of the subject to con tinue, imaging will be discontin ued.  The image data that has 
been collected up to that point will be analyz ed. Clinical laboratory tests will be obtained 
prior to injection and upon completion of each imaging session. Adverse events will be 
monitored continuously during the imaging se ssion. Subjects who experience any adverse 
event during an imaging session will not be di scharged until the event has resolved or 
stabilized. 
A follow-up phone call to the subject, or de signated decision maker, will be conducted 
between [ADDRESS_333373] information a bout any new adverse events.  
If both of these days are not business da ys, the follow-up phone call can occur the 
following business day.  
5.2. Planned Dosage and Duration of Treatment 
5.2.1. Dosage and Administration 
Florbetapir F 18: 
Subjects will receive a single IV bolus admi nistration target dose of 370 MBq (10 mCi) 
of Florbetapir F 18 Injection. 
LY3191748
Protocol 18F-AV-1451-A05   Confidential 
 
Page 21 of 53 
 18F-AV-1451: 
All subjects will receive a single IV bolus administration target dose of 370 MBq (10 
mCi) of 18F-AV-1451 Injection. 
5.2.2. Rationale for Dosages  
This trial is designed to evaluate the brain tau protein imaging properties and safety of 
18F-AV-1451 to be used in subjects with c ognitive impairment and healthy volunteers. 
18F-AV-1451 will be administered IV in a ra dioactive target dose of 370 MBq with a 
maximum human mass dose (MHD) limited to 20 µg of compound by [CONTACT_8497].  This dose 
is 150 fold lower than the NOAEL observed in  the rat single dose t oxicity study and is 50 
fold lower than the NOAEL observed in the rat and dog repeat dose toxicity studies. 
Human dosimetry has been obtained in nine su bjects. The results estimated an Effective 
Dose of 8.92 mSv for an anticipated 370 MBq (10 mCi) injection and is comparable to 
the effective dose of approved 18F-labeled compounds such as  FDG and Florbetapir F [ADDRESS_333374] been reported using this 
regimen.

Genetic Samples 
A one-time blood collection (10 mL, blood) will  be performed on the day of the initial 
18F-AV-[ADDRESS_333391] patient visit for the study at a facility selected by [CONTACT_456]. The sample and any 
data generated from it can only be linked back to the patient by [CONTACT_1697]-site 
personnel. Subjects may opt out of participation. 
Pregnancy Testing  
 Serum beta hCG, qualitative:   performed at screening for females of 
childbearing potential who are not surgica lly sterile.  A serum pregnancy test 
may also be obtained prior to injection at the Imaging Visit if required by [CONTACT_272740]. 
 Urine beta hCG:  performed at both the 18F-AV-1451 and florbetapir F 18 
imaging visit(s) prior to injection for females of childbearing potential

surgically sterile). 
Ohio State University Traumatic Brain Injury Identificati on Method (OSU TBI-ID) 
Tau pathology can be associated with Trauma tic Brain Injury (TBI), therefore the OSU 
TBI-ID (Corrigan and Bogner 2007) short version will be used to screen for a history of 
traumatic brain injury. It is the briefest vers ion that still provides several summary indices 
on which the original version was validated. To  shorten the instrument, TBIs resulting in 
loss of consciousness are emphasized  over less severe injuries. 
Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)  
The MMSE (Folstein et al., 1975) is a brief instrument used to assess cognitive function 
in elderly patients.  The instrument is divide d into [ADDRESS_333393] section is 21.  The 
second section tests the ability of the patient  to name [CONTACT_272755], follow verbal and written 
commands, write a sentence, and copy figures.  The maximum score for the second 
section is 9.  The range for th e total MMSE score is 0 to 30.

 Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale—Cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog  11)  
The ADAS (ADAS-Cog; Rosen et al. 1984)  was designed to assess the severity of the 
dysfunction in the cognitive and noncognitive be haviors characteristic of persons with 
AD.  The cognitive subscale of the ADAS, the ADAS-Cog 11, consists of [ADDRESS_333394]  typi[INVESTIGATOR_272725]:  orientation, verbal memory, 
language, and praxis.  The scale ranges from [ADDRESS_333395] (DSST) 
The DSST (Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scal e F Revised, 1981) is a paper test of 
psychomotor performance in which the subject  is given a key of numbers and matching 
symbols and a test section with numbers and empty boxes. Under each number the 
subject should write down the corresponding symbol as fast as  possible. The score is the 
number of correct number-symbol matches made  within the allowed time (90 seconds).  
The strategy to solve the DSST consists of  sequential encoding and retrieval of numbers 
and corresponding symbols.  Incidental me mory, visuo-motor coordination, perceptual 
organization, and selective attention are ke y factors that determine the final score 
(Wechsler Adult Intelligence ScaleFRevised, 19 81).  The ability to sort out irrelevant 
information (e.g., symbols that may look alike) also impacts performance. This test has high test–retest reliability (M atarazzo and Herman, 1984).  
Digit span forward and backward (Wech sler Memory Scale-Revised (WMS-R)) 
Digit Span is composed of two tasks admini stered independently of  each other: Digits 
Forward and Digits Backward. On both tasks,  the examiner reads a series of number 
sequences to the subject. For each Digits Forwar d item, the subject is required to repeat 
the number sequence in the same order as presented. For Digits Back ward, the subject is 
required to repeat the number se quence in the reverse order.  
Trail Making A and B 
The trail making test (Reitan and Wolfson, 1985)  is a test of executive function. Part A 
consists of [ADDRESS_333396] s by [CONTACT_740] a line as quickly as possible in 
ascending numerical order. Part B consists of 25 circles containing either numbers (1 
through 13) or letters (A-L).  The subject is instructed to connect the circles while 
alternating between numbers and letters in ascending order. The subject is timed. The 
time to complete Part A is a [ADDRESS_333397], Immediate a nd Delayed Recall, Story A (WMS-R) 
The logical memory test (Wechsler D. 1987) as sesses the ability to recall a short story. 
Subjects are read a story and asked to reca ll the story immediatel y and after a delay. 
Animal list generation 
The animal list generation (Morris et al. 1989)  is used to measure verbal fluency. The 
subject is asked to name [CONTACT_272756] [ADDRESS_333398] (BNT) (30 item) 
The [ADDRESS_333399] (Kaplan, et al . 1983) is a measure of the ability to 
orally label [ADDRESS_333400] (ANART) 
ANART (Grober and Sliwinski 1991) is a measure for estimating premorbid verbal 
intelligence. The subject is presented with a wo rd list and asked to pronounce the words.    
Clock drawing test 
The clock drawing test (Goodglass and Kaplan 1983) has two components: a command condition and a copy condition. In the comm and condition, the subject draws a clock 
according to verbal instructions. In the c opy condition, the subject copi[INVESTIGATOR_014] a model clock 
drawn at the top of a form.  
Judgment of Line Orientation Test (JOLO) 
The JOLO (Benton 1978) is a non-motor measure of visual perceptual  ability where there 
is no time demand. The task asks subjects to ma tch two lines by [CONTACT_272741] a test set of lines presented below the stimulus lines.  Pfeffer Functional Activ ities Questionnaire (FAQ) , (Pfeffer et al. 1982) 
Functional status is conceptualized as the “ab ility to perform self-care, self- maintenance 
and physical activities.” FAQ was developed to  assess instrumental activities of daily 
living involving higher level functional ski lls such as shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_224115], writing checks, 
remembering appointments..etc. FAQ asks info rmant to rate patient’s ability using the 
following scoring system: Depe ndent = 3; Requires assist ance = 2; Has difficulty but 
does by [CONTACT_6270] = 1; Normal = 0; Never did [t he activity] but could do now = 0; Never did 
and would have difficulty now = 1T he sum scores ranges from 0-30. 
Clinical Dementia Rati ng (CDR) Scale (Berg, 1988) 
The CDR examines 6 categories of cognitive functioning domains. Each domain is 
scored on a scale ranging from 0 to 3 (incl uding 0.5). A global rating of dementia can be 
generated from the domain scores . A CDR Sum of Boxes can be generated from the total 
across domains.  
Physician Visit 
A physician must see the subject at screeni ng, at baseline, prior to drug administration 
and at study end, prior to  discharge from both the 18F-AV-1451 and florbetapir F 18 
imaging sessions.  At this time, the physician should review all safety data and briefly 
examine/query the subject regarding potential ad verse events or other treatment issues.  A 
physician or physician designee can administer  these assessments on the day of imaging 
for the florbetapir F 18 imaging session only.

7.3. Protocol for Image Collection 
The sponsor will prepare and distribute a PET Imaging Manual for 18F-AV-1451 and 
florbetapir F 18. MRI image acquisition parame ters and transmission procedures will be 
outlined in an MRI procedures manual.   
7.4. Good Clinical Practice and Monitoring 
All clinical studies performed under the di rection of Avid/CRO will be conducted in 
accordance with applicable regulatory re quirements and International Conference on 
Harmonization (ICH) Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and Avid/CRO Standard Operating 
Procedures (SOP).  
This includes: 
1. IRB/IEC approval:  An investigation will be initiated at a study site only after the 
IRB/IEC for that study site has given thei r written approval of  the protocol and 
informed consent;    
2. Informed Consent:  Study procedures will not be initiated until the subject and/or 
their   legally authorized  representative (as appropriate) signs the informed 
consent form;   
3. Recording and monitoring of adverse even ts as outlined in Section 7.7.3 including 
the notification of study site  clinical investigators,  local IRBs and the FDA 
regarding serious adverse event; 
4. Avid RP’s obligation to monitor the part icipating center on a regular basis; and 
5. The termination of a center or the trial if  conditions apply, as outlined in Section 
5.6. 
7.5. Informed Consent and Subject Information 
Potential subjects, or their le gally authorized representati ve (as appropriate), will be 
allowed to read a written informed consent fo rm.  The principal inve stigator or designee 
will explain all study procedures, risks, and alte rnative therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  The subject and legally 
authorized representative will have an opport unity to have all questions answered by a 
physician.  The subject will then sign and da te the informed consent form, indicating 
willingness to participate in the study. Subjects with AD are potentially a vulnerab le population with compromised mental 
capacity.  Investigators should take extra care to evalua te a patient’s ability to give 
consent.  If the subject is capable of giving informed cons ent then the subject should sign 
on the consent line of the informed consent form.  When applicable the legally authorized

Page [ADDRESS_333402]’s 
consent, and further agree to participate as an informant. 
If the subject is not capable of giving consent, consent may be given by a legally 
authorized representative.  However, it is expected that all subject s entering this study 
should at least have the capacity to understa nd that they are engagi ng in a research study 
and should affirm that they do not object  to participating, by [CONTACT_272742].  If the lega l guardian is also the informant, the guardian 
must still sign the informant line of th e form, indicating thei r own willingness to 
participate as an informant. 
All informed consent forms must be approved by [CONTACT_176096], and by [CONTACT_272743] (IRB).  No study related procedures shall be 
performed prior to completion of the inform ed consent process, and signing of the 
consent form.  A copy of the signed informed consent should be given to the patient and/or their legally authorized representative for their records. 
7.6. Documentation 
18F-AV-1451 and florbetapir F 18 PET scans, as well as MRI scan s, will be saved in an 
appropriate electronic format as specified in the imaging manuals.  A copy of all scans 
will be saved at the site/imaging center a nd a copy of each will be forwarded to the 
sponsor or to the designated imaging core la b as described in the imaging manuals.  All 
other data required by [CONTACT_272744].  All data in the CRF will 
be substantiated by “source documents,” whic h consist of the subj ect’s medical files, 
laboratory result sheets, ECG tr acings, etc.  All source doc umentation must be available 
to Avid and designees.  Completed source doc uments and CRFs may need to be made 
available and complete for an audit by [CONTACT_3433] e FDA or other international regulatory 
authorities or Avid at any time.  A ballpoint pen should be used to ensure that all copi[INVESTIGATOR_272726].  CRFs and all other records must be filed in accordance with applicable laws 
and regulations (see Section 10.6)  
7.7. Adverse Events (AE) 
Avid’s standards for recording and reporting adverse events (AEs) are to be followed 
regardless of applicable regulat ory requirements that may be le ss stringent.  All AEs must 
be fully recorded on the Adverse Event Page of  the eCRF. Investigators will be instructed 
to report to Avid or its designee their asse ssment of the potential relatedness of each AE 
to investigational product or protocol procedur e via electronic data en try.  If a patient’s 
treatment is discontinued as a result of an AE , study site personnel must clearly report to 
Avid or its designee via electronic data entr y the circumstances and data leading to any 
such discontinuation of treatment. In cas es where the investigator notices an 
unanticipated benefit to the patient, study site personnel should report “unexpected benefit” with the actual event term to Avid  or its designee (for example, the complete 
actual term would be “unexpected  benefit- sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_176073]”). 
Laboratory test abnormalities considered by [CONTACT_272745].  Signs and symptoms of each 
AE should be described in detail (e.g., start and stop dates/time, severity/intensity, 
LY3191748
Protocol 18F-AV-1451-A05   Confidential 
 
Page [ADDRESS_333403] ion taken, and outcome).  Additionally, any 
clinically significant findings from laboratory evaluations, vital sign measurements, or 
other study procedures including th ose that result in a diagno sis should be reported as an 
AE to Avid or its designee.  
7.7.1. Adverse Event Monitoring 
Each patient must be carefully monitored fo r adverse events.  This includes clinical 
laboratory test variables.  An  assessment must be made of the severity/intensity and 
relationship to the administra tion of the trial medication. 
7.7.2. Adverse Event Definitions 
Adverse Events  
For reporting purposes, Avid will distinguish  among pre-existing conditions, treatment -
emergent adverse events and trial-emergent adverse events.  Pre-existing conditions (i.e., 
undesirable experiences, signs or symptoms that  begin prior to the Screening Visit) will 
be recorded on the medical history and/or physical exam  eCRF pages.  Signs and 
symptoms that are believed to be due to th e pre-existing condition (started prior to dose 
of study medication) do not have  to be recorded in the AE s section of the eCRF, unless 
there is an increase in frequency or severity.  Additionally, signs or symptoms or changes 
in pre-exisiting conditions th at occur outside the trial de fined adverse event reporting 
period (e.g., between the end of the baseline /cross-sectional imaging period and the 9 
month follow-up imaging period) will be  recorded in medical history. 
An adverse event is any untoward medical occu rrence associated with the use of a drug in 
humans, whether or not consid ered drug related. For the pur poses of this study, untoward 
medical occurrences will be considered associated with the use of 18F-AV-1451, and thus 
be reported as adverse events, if  they occur within [ADDRESS_333404] medical occurrences occurring, during the 
baseline/cross-sectional im aging period but not during the 48 hour windows following 
the administration of 18F-AV-1451 or Florbetapir F 18 inje ction.  For this purpose, the 
baseline/cross-sectional imaging period will be  defined as beginning with the signing of 
consent and ending [ADDRESS_333405] of the screening/ baseline procedures described 
in sections 7.1.1 – 7.1.3, including (but not li mited to) neuropsychological testing, MRI, 
18F-AV-[ADDRESS_333406] administration (i.e., 18 month vi sit or early termination visit) of 18F-AV-1451.

Serious Adverse Event (SAE) 
An SAE is an AE that results in one of the following outcomes or constitutes one of the 
following events: 
 Death; 
 Initial or prolonged inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_18543] (other than that required by 
[CONTACT_990]; “social hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” or  any hospi[INVESTIGATOR_33566]-medical 
reasons does not constitute an SAE); 
 A life-threatening experience (tha t is, immediate risk of dying); 
 Persistent or significant disability/incapacity; 
 Congenital anomaly/birth defect; 
 Considered significant by [CONTACT_941] i nvestigator for any other reason. 
Important medical events that may not resu lt in death, be life-th reatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272727], based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient and may require medical 
or surgical intervention to  prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. 
Unexpected Adverse Event 
An unexpected adverse event is an adverse ev ent not previously re ported or an adverse 
event that occurs with specificity, severity or  frequency that is not  consistent with the 
current investigator’s brochure. 
Relationship to Investigational Product 
Investigators will be instructed  to report their assessment of the potential relatedness of 
each adverse event to protocol procedure, c oncomitant medication and/or investigational 
product.  The assessment of the relationship of  an adverse event to the administration of 
the investigational product is a clinical deci sion based on all available information at the 
time of the completion of the eCRF. Intensity/Severity of an Adverse Event 
In addition to assessing the relationship of  the administration of  the investigational 
product to adverse events, an assessment is re quired of the intensit y (severity) of the 
event.  
The following classifications should be used: 
Mild:   
A mild adverse event is an adverse event, us ually transient in natu re and generally not 
interfering with normal activities. Moderate :   
A moderate adverse event is an adverse ev ent that is sufficiently discomforting to 
interfere with normal activities. 
LY3191748
Protocol 18F-AV-1451-A05   Confidential 
 
Page 40 of 53 
 Severe:   
A severe adverse event is an adverse event that incapacitates the subject and prevents 
normal activities.   Note that a severe event is  not necessarily a seriou s event.  Nor must a 
serious event necessarily be severe. 
7.7.3. Adverse Event Documentation 
All adverse events must be fully recorded on the Adverse Event Page via the Electronic 
Data Capture (EDC) system.  Documentati on must be supported by [CONTACT_272746].  Laboratory test, vital si gns and ECG abnormalities considered by [CONTACT_272747].  Signs and symptoms of each AE should be described in detail (e.g., start and stop 
dates, severity/intensity, re lationship to investigationa l product, action taken, and 
outcome). 
Adverse events and laboratory test abnormalities fulfilling the definition of a serious 
adverse event should, in addition, be reporte d on the Serious Adverse Event Reporting 
Form. 
7.7.4. Reporting of Serious Adverse Events  
Study site personnel must alert Eli Lilly or its designee of any SAE within [ADDRESS_333407], regardless 
of the investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_25289].  Therefore, SA Es that occur later than [ADDRESS_333408] been caused by a protocol procedure.  Previously planned (prior to 
signing the ICF) surgeries should not be re ported as SAEs unless the underlying medical 
condition has worsened duri ng the course of the study.  
8. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
8.1. General Statistical Considerations 
All statistical analyses will be performed using SAS® version 8.2 or higher. 
Data will be summarized using descriptive statistics (number of subjects [N], mean, 
standard deviation [SD], me dian, quartiles, minimum, a nd maximum) for continuous 
variables and using frequency count and pe rcentage for discrete variables.  The 
demographic and baseline characteristics data will be summarized according to clinical

 group (healthy volunteers and subjects with c ognitive impairment) at recruitment for all 
subjects in the safety population.  Safety data will be summarized for all patients. 
Subject listings of all data from the electronic case report forms (eCRFs) as well as any 
derived variables will be presented.  
Additional details concerning statistical anal yses will be included in the Statistical 
Analysis Plan (SAP). 
8.1.1. Sample Size Estimation 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Exploratory Phase 
A total of 230 subjects (80 cognitively h ealthy volunteers, 80 MCI and 70 AD) will be 
enrolled in the Exploratory Phase study.   To explore the 18F-AV-[ADDRESS_333409] deviation (SD) of SUVR from combination ROI was 0.06 for 
subjects with low probability of AD. Th erefore assuming a 0.06 SD, a sample of 15 
subjects will give an approximately 90% probability to observe a 95% confidence interval (CI) as accurate as +/-0.04 around the point estimation.  
From previous studies, the amyloid positive rate is approximately 50% among MCI 
patients and approximately 80% from AD subjects. Therefore 80 MCIs and 70 ADs will 
likely result in 40 amyloid positive MCIs and 56 amyloid positive ADs. Also from study T807000, the combination ROI SUVR differ ence between CN and AD was 0.39, with a 
pooled SD of 0.27. Assume a pooled SD of  0.30, a sample of 60 CNs and 56 amyloid 
positive ADs will give a 90% power to detect a 0.18 difference between the CN and AD groups.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Confirmatory Phase 
 
The final hypothesis and endpoint measurements for the Confirmatory Phase are yet to be 
determined and will depend on the discoveries from Exploratory Phase data. However the 
primary objective of the confirmatory phase is to validate the accuracy of 
18F-AV-[ADDRESS_333410] clinically significant disease progression within 18 months from scan 
(e.g., cognitive function deterioration as m easured by [CONTACT_272748]).  For the purpose of sample size calculation, we assumed that the target 
success criteria would be at least 70% sens itivity and at least 70% specificity for 18F-AV-
[ADDRESS_333411] this deterioration, with  the lower bound of 95% confidence intervals 
(CI) above 50% for both sensitivity and sp ecificity. Preliminary analysis of the 
exploratory phase cohort data showed that clinical assessm ents may have a relatively 
large variance. It is important to ensure th at enough subjects will be in each group for 
sensitivity and specificity calculation (i.e., the subjects with or without a significant 
disease progression).  To that end, we assume at least 20% of the s ubjects will be in each 
group at the 18 month follow up.  With this assumption, a 5% tw o-sided type I error rate, 
LY3191748
Protocol 18F-AV-1451-A05   Confidential 
 
Page 42 of 53 
 and that 95% CI will be calculated using Wilson score method, a sample of 115 subjects 
will provide an over 90% probability to obs erve lower bound of 95% CI above 50%, for 
both sensitivity and specificity.    Also assuming an approximate 20% drop out rate over the 18 months follow up, this study will aim to enroll 150 subjects in total.    
 
8.1.2. Exploratory Phase, Cross-sectional Component 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Primary Objective Analysis 
ANOVA analysis will be applie d to detect the difference between clinical diagnosis 
groups. If an overall difference is detected, pair-wised comparisons will be conducted. If 
the pre-requisites of ANOVA test are not met, Kruskal Wallis and Wilcoxon rank sum 
test will be conducted instead. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Secondary Objective Analysis 
Descriptive statistics will be applied to describe the tau SUVR distribution across age 
groups among cognitive healthy subjects. These data will also be graphically displayed.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Exploratory Objective Analyses 
Correlation analysis will be conducted to dete rmine whether greater degrees of cognitive 
impairment are associated with higher 
18F-AV-1451 uptake in subjects with an amyloid 
positive status.  
Correlation analysis will be conducted to a ssess the relationship between regional tau 
deposition measurements with cognitive function measurements and other collected 
biomarkers.  
The association between baseline values in 18F-AV-1451 uptake in brain and clinical 
function measures, as well as, biomarkers of  neurodegeneration and neurological disease 
will be explored using the methods described below in [IP_ADDRESS].  
Subgroup and/or covariate analyses will also  be planned accordingly by [CONTACT_272749], age groups, and etc. The specific an alyses to address these objectives will be 
described in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) 
8.1.3. Exploratory Phase, Longitudinal Component 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Primary Objective Analysis 
The primary objective of longitudinal component is to assess the rate of change of tau 
deposition as measured by 18F-AV-1451 over time. The tau measurement change from 
baseline at each follow up visit will be esti mated using Mixed Model Repeated Measures 
(MMRM). The MMRM model will include the following fixed effects: baseline value, 
clinical group, visit, clinical  group by [CONTACT_23259], and baseline age. Visit will be 
considered as a categorical variable. An uns tructured covariance matrix will be used to 
model the within-subject corre lation. Least squared means (LSM) and standard error for 
LY3191748
Protocol 18F-AV-1451-A05   Confidential 
 
Page 43 of 53 
 the tau value change from baseline will be ca lculated for each clinical group at every 
follow up visit.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Exploratory objective analyses 
The association between change and/or baseline values in 18F-AV-1451 uptake in brain 
and clinical function measures, as well as, biomarkers of neurodegeneration and 
neurological disease (CSF markers including tau, phosphor-t au and beta-amyloid (Aβ ), 
genetic markers, PET amyloid imaging, br ain atrophy assessed by [CONTACT_234346], and 
resting connectivity assessed with rsfMRI) w ill also be assessed using MMRM analyses. 
Marginal logistic regression and time to  event analyses will also applied when 
appropriate, such as to inves tigate the odds ratio of ADAS sc ore change over 4 with the 
tau deposition change over time. The details of these statistical analyses will be provided 
in SAP.    
8.1.4. Confirmatory Phase 
Longitudinal data from the exploratory study phase will be assessed periodically to 
determine the relationships between various 18F-AV-1451 imaging parameters (e.g., 
composite and regional SUVr, voxel based statistics and visual inte rpretation) and the 
change from baseline in the various cognitive and functional assessments.  These data will be used to generate hypotheses regarding the relationship between 
18F-AV-1451 PET 
tau imaging and cognitive/functional change that will be formally in corporated into an 
analysis plan and tested in the conf irmatory stage of the study.     
Based on discoveries using data from Exploratory Phase, a disease progression measurement will be chosen as truth standard (TS), and the accuracy of 
18F-AV-[ADDRESS_333412] this TS within 18 mont hs of scan will be evaluated.  Hypothesis 
testing and detailed analyses will be described in a statistical analysis plan (SAP), which will be finalized prior to database lock. Possi ble analyses include calculation of accuracy 
measures such as sensitivity, specificity, and two sided 95% conf idence intervals (CI) 
around these rates. Other analyses may include  Mixed-Effect Model Repeated Measures 
(MMRM) analysis, risk ratio analys is, and time to event analysis.   
8.2. Safety Analysis 
Safety laboratory test results and vital signs measurements will be summarized by [CONTACT_272750].  Change from ba seline (pre-dose time point) values will be 
determined and summarized.   Subjects whose laboratory values are outside the pre-determined upper and lower limits of normal will be identified and tabulated.  
Adverse events including injection site reac tions will be summarized in terms of number 
and percentage of subjects experiencing an AE.  The summary will be further broken 
down by [CONTACT_9313] (SOC) and preferred term using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) terms.  A dverse events will also be presented by 
[CONTACT_926], relationship to treatment and serious ness.  All subjects who experience SAEs or 
who discontinue due to AEs will be summarized. 
Discontinuation  
LY3191748
Protocol 18F-AV-1451-A05  Confidential
Page 44 of 53 All subjects who discontinued participation prior to completing th e study will be listed 
and their discontinuation reasons will be tabulated. 
Laboratory Data 
Changes in laboratory data from Base line will be summarized.  Subjects whose 
laboratory values are outside threshold va lues will be identified and tabulated. 
Vital Signs 
Changes in vital signs from baseline will be summarized. 
ECG 
Mean changes in ECG parameters will be summarized.  The average of the two ECG 
collected prior to administration of 18F-AV-1451 on imaging day (-10 and -5 min prior to 
the administration of 18F-AV-1451), will be used for the baseline estimate.  Any subjects 
showing QTc > [ADDRESS_333413] (ROI, designed in MNI brain atlas) in te rms for standard uptake value 
ratio (SUVr, normalized by [CONTACT_272751]). The spatially normalized images and the 
measured SUVr values will be used to acco rdingly to accomplish the study objectives.  
Exploratory analysis will include co-registration of MRI to the 18F-AV-1451 PET images 
for ROI creation and/or part ial volume correction of 18F-AV-1451 PET images using 
anatomical information from MRI data. 
Additional analyses may explore various voxel and threshold based approaches.   
The final primary method image analysis for th e confirmatory phase will be chosen based 
on results from the exploratory phase before any of the confirmatory phase images are 
analyzed. 
9. USE OF DATA AND PUBLICATION
Avid adheres to the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) 
Principles 
on Conduct of Clinical Trials a nd Communication of Clini cal Trial Results. A 
complete copy of these principles is available from Avid and can also be found at the 
PhRMA website (http://www.phrma.org). 
 Our policy is briefly summarized below: 
We commit to timely communication of meaningful results of controlled
clinical trials, rega rdless of outcome.
As a sponsor, we may recommend that th e Investigator(s) delay or decline
publication in cases where the study desi gn, conduct, or data are insufficient
LY3191748
Protocol 18F-AV-1451-A05   Confidential 
 
Page 45 of 53 
 to allow meaningful interpretation.  Av id and the Investigator(s) will discuss 
the study design and data in advance of the study, and again after completion, 
and will strive, through appropriate scie ntific debate, to reach a consensus 
regarding the potential merits of publication. 
 Avid retains the right to review any ma nuscripts, presentations, or abstracts 
before they are submitted for publication. Where differences of opi[INVESTIGATOR_272728], the parties (Avid 
and the Investigator) should try to resolve them through appropriate scientific 
debate.  Avid retains the right to dela y publication for up to [ADDRESS_333414] 
intellectual property.  
 Anyone who provides substantial contri butions should rece ive appropriate 
recognition as an author or contribut or when the manuscript is published.  
This is a multi-center study. The primary analys is will include data from all centers.  A 
multicenter publication, reporting th e primary analysis data set, with authorship from all 
contributing centers, should pr ecede any other publications. 
10. INVESTIGATOR’S REGULATORY OBLIGATIONS

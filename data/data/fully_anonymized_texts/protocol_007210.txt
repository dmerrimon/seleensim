Obesity Capsule v. Placebo  
Version 5.[ADDRESS_613163] that gut microbiota play an important role in 
regulating human metabolism via effects on body weight and systemic insulin resistance.1 
In rodents, manipulation of the gut flora with fecal microbiota transfer (FMT) induces 
weight loss and prevents development of obesity.2,[ADDRESS_613164] been difficult to discover; indeed [ADDRESS_613165] been postulated to modulate energy  absorption, gut motility, appetite, glucose and 
lipid metabolism, and hepatic fatty storage.9 The precise mechanisms by [CONTACT_477953].  The dominant the ories involve (1) increased 
energy harvesting from fermentation of foods otherwise indigestible to the host, (2) 
enlarging the nutrient absorption surface by [CONTACT_477954][INVESTIGATOR_192797], 
and (3) interaction with enteroendocrine cells to prom ote hormonal changes that 
influence host appetite and satiety, and (4) absorption of bacterial fragments such as 
lipopolysaccharides leading to “metabolic endotoxinemia”, which promotes obesity and 
hyperinsulinemia.  
 
Gut microbiome and obesity  
Intestinal b acteria have been implicated in the etiology of obesity.[ADDRESS_613166] that is independent of diet.10 These germ -free mice are also resistant to 
diet-induced obesity.11 Genetically obese mice (ob/ob) have a reduction in the relative 
abundance of Bacteroidetes, with a proportional increase in Firmicutes.12 Importantly, 
similarly altered ratios of firmicutes:bacteroidetes and overall reductions in microbial 
diversity have been demonstrated in comparisons of obese and lean adults12-[ADDRESS_613167] delivery of donor 
fecal material into the gut.  Colonization of germ -free mice with intestinal flora from 
obese mice led to greater increases in body  weight and fat tissue than colonization with 
flora from lean mice.25 Other stu dies demonstrate that fecal microbiota transfer (FMT) 
from thin or obese adults can transmit the lean or fat phenotype when transplanted into 
mice, in the setting of the correct dietary conditions.[ADDRESS_613168] number, and 
transplant of gut microbiota into germ -free mice led to normalization of bone mass.26 
Antibiotics and probiotics causing shifts in the microbiota spectra can also increase bone 
mass in animals models (Ohlsson et al Endo Metab 2014).[ADDRESS_613169] FMT protocols involve invasive procedures such as colonoscopy, nasogastric / 
duodenal tubes, or retention enemas, which are accompanied by [CONTACT_477955], 
risks, and costs.  Recently, we have developed a new FMT protocol that involves the 
capsulization of frozen fecal material.5 These oral capsules were highly effective in 
resolving otherwise refractory cases of C. difficile  infection. The increased ease, 
tolerability, and safety of oral administration now allow study of FMT for sustained 
therapeutic intervention.  This extended exposure is a major advance, and more likel y to 
durably alter the microbiome.   
 
Contributions of this study to the field  
We believe that transfer of the “lean” microbiota to an obese recipi[INVESTIGATOR_477927].  Therefore, we propose to conduct a randomized 
double -blind placebo -controlled pi[INVESTIGATOR_477928].  This highly 
innovative study will leverage this new non -invasive FMT technique to promote durable 
changes i n the gut microbiome, and could represent a new horizon of treatments for 
 
 
Obesity Capsule v. Placebo  
Version 5.[ADDRESS_613170] of gut 
microbiome alterations on weight, insulin sensitivity, and other important metabolic 
endpoints . 
 
Aim 1 . To identify and characterize healthy lean donors from a phenotypic 
perspective to generate FMT capsules for a clinical trial in obese subjects.   
 
Aim 2.  To determine the impac t of oral capsulized FMT from healthy lean 
donors on insulin sensitivity in obese adults in a 3 -month randomized double -
blind placebo -controlled trial. Secondary outcomes include changes in body 
weight , metabolic markers, and FMT -related adverse events.  We hypothesize that 
FMT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_477929] s ensitivity and other 
metabolic endpoints. An optional extension study will evaluate the durability of 
gut microbiome change at 12 months.  
 
Aim 3. To explore  associations between the gut microbiome and bone density .

Version 5.[ADDRESS_613173] ENROLLMENT  
 
Methods of enrollment:    
Obese adults  will be recruited from the MGH Weight Center . The PI [INVESTIGATOR_477932]. However, if a patient of the PI’s is identified 
who may be eligible for the study, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_1318] a sk a physician colleague to explain the 
study and will provide patients the Consent Form to review at home.  In addition, 
recruiting advertisements will be posted on email, the internet, and by [CONTACT_193858].  Finally, we 
will add the study to the  https://register. clinicaltrials.gov database.  All letters and 
advertisements will be approved by [CONTACT_477957].  All eligible 
obese subjects will be invited to participate in the hyperinsulinemic -euglycemic clamp 
substudy.  
 
Optional Substud ies 
All participants will be asked if they are interested in participating in the option al 
substud ies as part of the initial screening process. The first substudy is to examine 
associations of gut microbiome with bone density  (Aim 3 ). The  second substudy  is an 
extension  the main study’s s tool and blood sampling  to determine the longevity of any 
effects observed as a result of FMT. If participants  express interest, they will be enrolled 
in the substudies . 
 
Informed consent  
Written informed consent will be obtain ed by a nurse practitioner or physician 
investigator. In situations where a nurse practitioner is obtaining consent, subjects will be 
offered the option for further discussion with a physician investigator if they have any 
remaining questions. This offer w ill be documented in the research record.  
Any consent problems will be reported to the PHRC in real -time.  
 
  
Randomization  
Obese recipi[INVESTIGATOR_477933] a 1:[ADDRESS_613174] them in a vial 
labelled “STUDY Caps” for admi nistration so neither physician nor subject will be able 
to identify real vs placebo capsules.  The actual labeled containers identifying caps as real 
or placebo will then be sealed in an opaque envelope and saved for review at the time of 
unblinding.  Thi s will serve as a “double check” on actual assignment.

C. Technical Methods  
 
Phone scree n: Phone discussion to explain approach and alternatives briefly (10 -20 
minutes).  The purpose of this discussion is to ensure subjects who cannot get past the 
aesthetic concerns of this procedure do not spend time coming to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_477937] v. Placebo  
Version 5.[ADDRESS_613176] an in person discussion, even if not decided upon having the procedure 
are welcome to come in for further discussion. The consent form is provided at this time, 
if desired.  
 
FMT and placebo capsule preparation : We will generate FMT capsules from donors per 
our FDA -approved operating procedures. Donors will be asked to refrain from eating 
common allergens within 5 days of the donation (tree nuts, eggs, peanuts, shellfish) but 
otherwise not alter their diets.  Volunteers w ill have an interim health query for febrile, 
system, and GI symptoms at the time of donation, and defer collection if there is any 
change in health status.  Processing is carried out under aerobic conditions. A fecal 
suspension is generated in normal sali ne without preservatives. Materials are sequentially 
sieved to remove particulate material. The final slurry is concentrated by [CONTACT_477958] -suspended in saline at 1/10 volume of the initial sample with 10% glycerol added 
as a bacterial cryoprotec tant. Fecal 
matter solution is pi[INVESTIGATOR_477938] 0 
capsules (650µL), which are closed and 
then secondarily sealed in size 00 
capsules. Capsules are stored frozen at -
800C for up to 6 months at which point 
they are discarded if not used. 1 -2 hours 
prior to a dministration they will be 
transferred to -200C and then 
transported to the dosing site on dry ice. 
Commercially available acid -resistant 
hypromellose capsules (DRCaps, 
Capsugel, Cambridge, MA, [LOCATION_003]) are 
used. Each inoculum is prepared from 
the feces of a s ingle donor.  This project 
is under FDA IND #[ADDRESS_613177] of a 
combination of powdered cocoa and gelatin in normal saline/glycerol (same vehicle as 
FMT capsules). Gelatin is added to make the placebo solution more viscous and 
phys ically fill capsules in the same way that the standard FMT inoculum does for 
appearance purposes. Placebo capsules are identical in appearance to FMT capsules, and 
are included in the above mentioned  FDA  IND # [ZIP_CODE].   
 
FMT and placebo capsule administratio n: Subjects will be NPO at least [ADDRESS_613178] 12 oz of 
water during administration to facilitate dilution of stomach contents and transit into the 
small intestine. In the event of vomiting subjects will be observed, and not re -dosed.

minutes.  Immediate side effects are very uncommon in our experience. Capsules are 
odorless and tasteless and do not dissolve in the acidic environment of the stomach.   (In 
our stu dy of capsules to date we have had 1/[ADDRESS_613179]. One child vomited 
4 hours after capsules were administered.).  
 
Subjects receive a copy of the signed consent form to take home and an information sheet 
(attached)  on symptoms to monitor and study physician phone numbers.  All patients 
have our contact [CONTACT_477959]. Subjects are 
asked to inform us if they require the initiation of antibiotics for intercurrent clinical 
illness, during the study period.  
 
Subjects will receive capsules at weekly intervals (± 2 days) for   weeks  0-5.   
 
Subject counseling : Subjects will be counseled to remain on the same diet that they are 
currently on  and not to initiate any major exercise regimens throughout the  primary 12  
week  study  period .  In addition, women with child -bearing potential will be informed that 
they need to use contraception throughout the study .  If they are taking a hormonal 
contra ceptive, they need to remain on such until the end of the study.  If they are not 
using a hormonal contraceptive, they will need to use other forms of birth control, such as 
barrier methods with a spermicide, IUD, or abstinence.  We will ask that they not actively 
initiate or discontinue hormonal treatments during the study, as this may confound our 
assessments of body weight and insulin sensitivity.  
 
Height, weight measurements : Height and weight  measurements will be performed in 
triplicate in light clothi ng without shoes. Waist circumference will be measured as the 
narrowest circumference between the lower costal margin and iliac crest in the standing 
position at the end of a normal exhalation.  All measurements will be performed using 
standardized protocol s by [CONTACT_477960].  
 
Fecal sampling : Fecal samples will be collected from recipi[INVESTIGATOR_477939] 0, 1, 3, 5, 6, and 
12 (and 6 and 12 months  if subjects choose to participate in the optional extension study ), 
and stored in a -80°C freezer according to established protocols.28 Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_477940] s tool collection kits to bring home (see Stool Collection 
document).  All samples will be brought to MGH by [CONTACT_102].   
 
DXA : Whole body, hip and spi[INVESTIGATOR_477941]. DXA scans of the whole 
body will be obtained at baseline , 6 and 12 weeks  (and 12 months if subjects choose to 
participate in the optional extension study) . For those participating in the optional bone 
density substudy, DXA scans on the spi[INVESTIGATOR_477942] [ADDRESS_613180] Hologic Discovery A machines . Body  
composition (lean body, fat mass  including subcutaneous and visceral compartments ) and 
bone density (PA spi[INVESTIGATOR_050], total hip, and femoral neck) will be measured using standard 
DXA analysis procedures as recommended by [CONTACT_3455]. The effective absorbed

optional extension study is 0.076 mSv for these procedures.  
 
Hyperinsulinemic -euglycemic clamp : Subjects  will undergo clamp studies  to assess 
peripheral insulin sensitivity  at week [ADDRESS_613181] 20 minutes 
of the clamp using the DeFronzo method.29  Clamp procedure will be  as follows.   
 Subjects will be asked for fast for 12 hours prior to their study visit.   
 Insulin infusate will be prepared by [CONTACT_434695].  
 Two intravenous (IV) catheters will be in serted:   (1) one placed in the hand when 
access is available, otherwise in the forearm or antecubital space, to be used for 
venous sampling; (2) one placed in the antecubital space or proximal forearm and 
used for administration of insulin and 20% dextrose  as below.   
 The hand/forearm with the IV that will be used for venous sampling will be 
placed in a warming box for the duration of the clamp procedure, although it may 
be withdrawn if the subject finds the warmth uncomfortable.   
 At time “0” (approximately 9am), a priming dose of 300 mU/m2/min of insulin 
will be given for 2 minutes followed by a continuous infusion of 60 mU/m2/min 
for the next 118 minutes.   
 From 0 -120 minutes, a sample (≤ 0.5cc) of venous blood will be drawn every [ADDRESS_613182] two runs is ≥4mg/dL.   Samples for serum insulin 
concentration will be  drawn at times 0, 80, 100, 120 minutes . 
 Starting at 5 minutes, a variable 20% dextrose infusion will be administered to 
achieve a target glucose of 90mg/dL (range 85 -95mg/dL).   The rate will be 
adjusted by [CONTACT_093], an MD or NP who is trained in cl amp 
procedure.   The initial infusion rate of 20% dextrose will be 0 -30cc/hr, with the 
exact rate determined by [CONTACT_178447]’s fasting glucose, 
available clinical information, and, if available, data from the subject’s previous 
clam p procedure for the study.   (For example, a subject who is known clinically to 
be insulin resistant and has a fasting glucose of 110mg/dL would be started at a 
rate of 0cc/hr, whereas a lean, muscular subject who exercises regularly and has a 
fasting gluco se of 70mg/dL would be started at 30cc/hr.)  
 The rate of 20% dextrose infusion will be adjusted up or down for the duration of 
the clamp procedure by [CONTACT_093].   Rate changes of 0 -40cc/hr will be made 
by [CONTACT_434696] [ADDRESS_613183]’s venous glucose and 
rate of change in glucose, to achieve target glucose of 90mg/dL.   
 At 120 minutes, the insulin infusion will be discontinued, and the glucose infusion 
will continue for 30 more minutes.   During this time, subjects will be given  a 
meal.   At 150 minutes, venous glucose will be checked, and the glucose infusion 
will be discontinued if venous glucose ≥80mg/dL.   If glucose is <80mg/dL, the 
glucose infusion will be continued and will be weaned by [CONTACT_477961], with repeat venous glucose sampling every 10 minutes until the glucose 
is ≥80mg/dL and the infusion is stopped.

hypoglycemia and are asked to report immediately any symptoms.   Subjects are 
observed on the CRC for at least 20 minutes following discontinuation of glucose 
infusion.   
This procedure  assumes that the hyperinsulinemic state is sufficient to completely 
suppress hepatic glucose production and that there is no net change in blood gluc ose 
concentrations under steady -state conditions. Under such conditions, the rate of glucose 
infused is equal to the rate of whole -body glucose disposal (GDR) or metabolizable 
glucose (M) and reflects the amount of exogenous glucose necessary to fully comp ensate 
for the hyperinsulinemia.  
 
Indirect Calorimetry : A ventilated hood calorimeter ( VMAX  Encore ; Carefusion Corp, 
Yorba Linda, CA ) will be  utilized to assess resting energy expenditure (REE) and 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_38952] (RQ) by [CONTACT_477962] (VO2) and carbon dioxide 
production (VCO2) for 20 minutes under fasting conditions before the clamp .  REE will 
be normalized to lean body m ass as determined by [CONTACT_751] -energy x -ray absorptiometry.  
 
Compensation : Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_477944] $ 750 for completion of the study . $100 
for completing the baseline visit, $400 for completing the week 6 visit ($100 for the 
clamp  visit, $50 per capsule a dministration visit) , and $250 for the week 12 visit. If 
subjects choose to participate in the optional extension study, they will be compensated 
an additional $100 ($25 for 6 month visit and $75 for 12 month,visit). They  will also 
receive either a parking voucher or up to $ 20 to cover travel expenses at each visit  
 
D. Safety Monitoring  
Obese recipi[INVESTIGATOR_477945] (and standard exams 
when  seen in person ) by [CONTACT_477963]. Subjects will be 
followed closely , as noted above. Follow up calls made by a study coordinator will be 
documented and follow up information is reviewed on the same day with a study 
physician if any symptoms o f concern are identified.  A physician plan for ongoing 
follow -up will be noted and implemented.  In any case of adv erse events identified as 
grade  2 (moderate severity) an in -person visit with an investigator, either in the GI or ID 
outpatient practices, will be encouraged.   
 
An AE will be considered related if, in the judgment of the treating physician it is both 
temporally related to admin istration of the capsules, and there is no other reasonable 
alternative explana tion, and the AE  is not more reasonab ly attributed to progres sion of 
the underlying illnesses.   
 
Any serious adverse event (SAE) assessed as possibly, probably, or definitively related to 
fecal transplantation will be reported in an expedited fashion to the IRB and FDA. SAE’s  
are defined as any Grade 3 or 4 events as described on the attached AE grading chart, in 
addition to any event temporally associated with the study procedure that:  
 results in death;  
 is life threatening (places the subject at immediate risk of death from the event as 
it occurred);

 results in a persistent or significant disability/incapacity;  
 results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect;  
 any other adverse event that, based upon appropriate med ical judgment, may 
jeopardize the subject’s health and may require medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed above.  
 
Investigator monitoring with IRB and FDA oversight/reporting is  proposed.   
 
E. Study Stop Rules  
The study will have a stop/safety pause in the event of any probably or definitely related 
SAE , or any apparent transmission of enteric, viral, or other infection from a donor to 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]. (Given the careful screening of donors, we believe this is highly unlikely). A 
safety pause will also be initiated in the event of a clinically significant complication of 
ingestion of a large number of capsules, for example medication bezoar  (not observed to 
date in over 125 C. difficile patients treated, many with conc urrent GI disease) . We think 
this is very unlikely, given that we have demonstrated capsule dissolution occurs 
reasonably rapi[INVESTIGATOR_477946] (i.e. once caps reach the small intestine.) We will track 
but not specifically stop the study if the following p ossible expected events occur:  
 Transient fever after FMT (up to 102.5◦ F for 12 hours or less); this is 
occasionally noted, particularly in younger patients.  
 
F. Individual Subject Stop Rules  
By [CONTACT_29569], people will not continue dosing if the following happens:  
 If the individual is unable to swallow at least 10 capsules at a sitting.   Twenty 
capsules at week 0 and 10 capsules in subsequent weeks are the 
minimum s considered  a "full dose" for  treatment and analysis purposes.    
 If subject requests withdrawal.  
 If subject vomits with clinically evident aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516] (by [CONTACT_477964] ; not observed 
to date ) 
 If subject experiences an SAE attributed by [CONTACT_477965]  
 
G. Sample Sha ring 
We may share coded samples containing no PHI from both donors and recipi[INVESTIGATOR_477947], obesity, insulin 
sensitivity and probiotics/ecobiotics.  Both groups will be notified of this sharing u sing 
standard language in the consent forms.  We have no current plans or funding for these 
analyses but wish to keep this option open.  
 
 
VI.  BIOSTATISTICAL ANALY SIS   
 
Change in insulin sensitivity is the primary outcome and will be compared between 
placebo and FMT groups over 12 weeks  using longitudinal regression models .  
Secondary outcomes including change in in sulin sensitivity, lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], CRP , and DXA body 
composition  will be similarly investigated. This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_477948] v. Placebo  
Version 5.6  March 6, 2019  
Page 14                                                              and safety, and to obtain data for power calculations for a larger powered study. After 
accounting for 15% dropout rate, and assuming a standard deviation of insulin sensitivity 
of 30 -45% and a two -sided alpha  of 0.05, this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] (n=12 per group) has 80% 
power to detect a 40 -60% difference in insulin sensitivity between groups, and a 30 -45% 
difference from baseline within each group.  After accounting for 15% dropout rate, and 
assuming a standard deviatio n of weight loss of 5%  and a two -sided alpha of 0.05, this 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] (n=12 per group) has 80% power to detect a 6.6% difference in weight loss 
between groups , and a 5% difference in weight loss from baseline within each group .  
 
Fecal  samples from lean d onors and obese recipi[INVESTIGATOR_477949], as noted above.  If 
funding allows in the future, these samples  will undergo microbial analysis using 16S 
ribosomal DNA -based identification and deep sequencing techniques. Changes in the 
composition of the gut mi crobiota and metagenomic pathways will be correlated with 
clinical changes in metabolism.  
 
Bone mineral density (BMD) of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_050], hip, and whole body will be assessed at 
baseline  and at 12 months .  This pi[INVESTIGATOR_477950] .   
 
VII. RISKS AND DISCOMFORT S 
 
Capsule administration : The risks of FMT include transmission of an infectious agent 
from an unrelated individual, or the potential for acquisition of medical illnesses not 
currently understood to be related to altered GI flora (for example inflammatory 
conditions, obesity, etc).  We believe thes e risks are low .  Other possible risks include 
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fever (all rare based upo n experience to date). The risk  of 
bezoar is very low as capsules dissolve promptly in non -acidic environments. We believe 
there is no risk to placebo capsu les which contain gelatin, cocoa, and the same liquid 
vehicle as FMT caps (IV grade saline and USP glycerol).  
 
Blood drawing : The amount of blood drawn for subjects completing the study is 
approximately 200 ml over a period of 12 weeks  (or 260 mL over 12 months if subjects 
agree to enroll in optional substudy extension) . This does not pose excessive risk to 
patients and are within Institutional Review Board guidelines.  There is a small risk of 
bleeding, bruising and infection with phlebotomy.   
 
Euglycemi c Hyperinsulinemic clamp/insulin : Administration of insulin infusion can 
cause hypoglycemia. Blood sugar will be monitored every 5 minutes during the insulin 
clamp, and 20% dextrose is infused per protocol to achieve target blood glucose of 
90mg/dL. In the  event of hypoglycemia, 50% dextrose is available at the bedside, and a 
physician or nurse practitioner is present throughout the insulin clamp procedure. There 
is a minimal risk of burning when using a warming box. This is extremely rare. The 
warming box has an alarm that prevents the temperature from rising above the set limit.  
 
DXA : Each whole body DXA scan  delivers an effective radiation dose of 0.[ADDRESS_613184] Calorimetry : Indirect calorimetry for the measurement of resting energy 
expenditure is not known to  cause any health risks.  
 
 
VIII.  POTENTIAL BENEFITS  
 
It is hoped that s ubjects receiving FMT will experience weight loss and/or improvements 
in insulin sensitivity as a result of this intervention. Obese sub jects may not benefit from 
being in the study.  T hey can receive some medical information  (labs, DXA)  and will be 
referred to their physicians at the end of the study for continued care.   
 
The study is likely to benefit the overall population of individuals with obesity, as it will 
contribute to an improved understanding of the physiologic and microbiomic mechanisms 
that control weight and glucose metabolism.  An interesting scientific aspect of this study 
is analysis of the microbiome over time after  prolonged FMT in  obese but otherw ise 
generally healthy subjects without a markedly altered microbiome  at baseline.  This may 
lead to future targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_477951].  
 
 
IX. MONITORING AND QUALI TY ASSURANCE  
 
Clinical data  
The study coordinator and  study physicians will carefully review testing on donors 
together, prior to sample collection, to ensure all inclusion criteria are met and that no 
exclusion criteria are met. This is also re -checked for capsules at the time of each  
administration with a Certificate of Analysis. Case report forms and follow -up 
questionnaires for recipi[INVESTIGATOR_477952] a weekly or twice weekly basis for 
completeness and missing data points will be sought from records or phone contact [INVESTIGATOR_142809].   Weight measurements  and 48-hour food recalls will be evaluated by [CONTACT_477966].  
 
Capsule stability  
We do not expect, and have not previously observed a  decrement in the viability or 
efficacy of the capsules, which will be stored at -[ADDRESS_613185] extensive experience 
with both frozen, and lyophilized bacterial vaccin es for human use ,30-34 and previously 
generated SO Ps for short and long term analysis/stability testing of those mono -microbial 
frozen materials over time (under FDA IND # [ZIP_CODE] and [ZIP_CODE]). Capsules which are not 
structurally intact cannot be used (see Certificate of Analysis).  FMT Capsules are saved 
for analysis in the event of infection transmission. FMT Capsule lots where numbers 
allow have assessment of aerobic colony forming units over  time (0 and 6 months) as a 
measure of stability. Placebo capsules containing frozen food grade material are not 
analyzed, and simply discarded at the expi[INVESTIGATOR_320].

Effective Date: June 17, [ADDRESS_813631]
The study will recruit and randomize up to 308 participants.  Half (n=154)  
of these will be Gulf War Veterans who meet criteria for Chronic Multi-Symptom  
Illness (CMI), and the other half (n=154) will be Veterans from other periods of  
service who also meet criteria for CMI.  Half of the Gulf War Veterans (n=77) and  
half  of  the  non-Gulf  War  Veterans  (n=77)  will  be  randomly  assigned  to  the  
Mindfulness-Based  Stress  Reduction  ( MBSR) group,  and  the  other  154  
participants (77 Gulf War Veterans, 77 non-G ulf War Veterans) will be randomly  
assigned  to  the  augmented  Chronic  Disease  Self-Management  Program  
(aCDSMP) group.  As of July 2020, these groups will be conducted remotely  
using the VA’s Video Connect software, due to the restrictions resulting from the  
COVID-19 virus. Each of the group sessions are 2.5 hours long, and they meet  
once a week for 8-weeks, as well as once on a Saturday for 4 hours (between  
Week  6  and  7).  As  of  July  2020,  we  will  no  longer  be  including  Saturday  
sessions, given the difficulties of doing so in a remote learning format.  Each 
cohort  will  randomize  [ADDRESS_813632]. As of July 2020, groups are  
capped at 10 participants each, or 19 subjects randomized per cohort; this cap  
reflects ideal group sizes for the remote learning format.
Data will be collected from subjects during  five assessments while they  
are enrolled in the study: 1) at Baseline,  which will take place  within  6 weeks 
prior to beginning MBSR or aCDSMP; 2)  at “Midpoint,” between Week 4 and  
Week 5; 3) at “Post,” within a month following the completion of the group series;  
4) at 3-months after the group ended; and 5) at 6-months after the group ended.
At  each  of  these  assessments  except  the  Midpoint ,  researchers  will  
provide  and administer self-report  measures  to  the  participants  using  a  VA  
computer to assess changes in the following symptoms and attitudes over time  
and between the two study arms: pain, fatigue, cognitive failures, depression,  
PTSD, health- and mental-health-related quality of life, drug use, alcohol use and  
negative consequences, gastrointestinal distress, mindfulness, self-compassion,  
and decentering. These assessments can be completed both in person or by  
[CONTACT_648], as of March of 2020 all assessments will be completed by [CONTACT_613468]-19  restructions.  At the  Midpoint,  participants  complete a pen-and-
paper set of questionnaires assessing potential mediations (e.g. mindfulness and  
self-efficacy) and primary endpoints, which will allow mediation analyses to be  
performed in the future. 
At the Post Assessment, a qualitative interview will be conducted with Gulf War veterans to  
explore  impressions  of,  and  satisfaction  with,  the  two  different  treatments  (MBSR  and  
aCDSMP). List of Abbreviations

2.0Introduction
There have been numerous attempts to determine the cause of CMI among  
Gulf War (GW) Veterans1,2, but studies of treatment approaches to CMI remain  
limited,  and  thousands  of  Veterans  continue  to  suffer.[ADDRESS_813633] benefit  of cognitive behavioral therapy  
(CBT) and/or exercise on symptoms of CMI, which declined over follow-up.[ADDRESS_813634] of CBT on fatigue relative to usual care,  
limited effects on pain, and adherence to the treatment regimen was poor – only  
38% of the CBT plus exercise group, 36% of the CBT group, and 47% of the
exercise  group  attended  two-thirds  or  more  of  the  treatment  sessions.  The  
relative paucity of integrative treatment trials is noted in a recent Institute of  
v.8, 02/26/2020 Page 5 of 25

Effective Date: June 17, 2021
Medicine  (IOM)  report,7 which  emphasizes  the  need  for  additional  rigorous  
studies  of  integrative  approaches,  including  Complementary  and  Alternative  
Medicine (CAM) interventions.
Mindfulness-Based Interventions (MBIs) such as Mindfulness-Based Stress  
Reduction  (MBSR)  emphasize  patient  education  and  self-management,  and  
foster the ability to attend to thoughts, emotions, and bodily sensations with an  
attitude of curiosity, openness, acceptance, and love.8 Such an attitudinal shift  
has been theorized to promote cognitive and behavioral changes, and to foster  
more adaptive responses to stress and pain.9 There is evidence that MBIs also  
influence the key components of the biopsychosocial model: biological (e.g. the  
stress response), psychological (e.g. anxiety about symptoms, interpretations of  
symptoms), and social (e.g. engagement in health care/self-care activities and  
social support).8,10,11 MBIs can be considered an integrative approach, because of  
their potential to foster improvement across multiple domains of health,11-14 and 
thus  may be particularly well suited to the health concerns of GW Veterans.  
Participation in an MBI can be framed as teaching a person a life skill, the  
benefits  of  which  can  grow  over  time.12 MBSR  teaches  self-care  practices  
(mindfulness meditation) that participants are encouraged to utilize on a regular  
basis after finishing the course (and uptake of these practices has been shown to  
occur at a high rate; at least 75% report using mindfulness techniques in daily life  
at follow-up ranging from 6-48 months).9,[ADDRESS_813635]  been  applied  to  the  hallmark  of  symptoms  of  CMI,  including  
musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, and concentration/memory or mood disturbances.  
A brief summary of the effect of MBIs on these cardinal symptoms of CMI is  
provided below.
A  meta-analysis  of  acceptance-based  approaches  for  chronic  pain  found  
medium effects for pain intensity (d=0.48).14 Another review of 16 trials of MBIs  
showed reductions in pain intensity in 6 of 8 randomized controlled trials (RCTs),  
with medium effect sizes.[ADDRESS_813636] been few comparisons of MBSR to an active control. One non-
randomized pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] (n=50) compared MBSR to CBT and found a larger effect  
size  in  favor  of  MBSR  (d=0.87).16 Another  non-randomized  study  (n=58)  
compared MBSR to a social support group and found medium effects in favor of  
MBSR for sensory/affective pain, and large effects (d=1.10) using a pain visual  
analogue scale.17 The findings of prior pi[INVESTIGATOR_48409] – subject to the limitations of small  
sample sizes – are generally consistent with the data from our small pi[INVESTIGATOR_613455] (n=55), which showed greater reductions in  pain severity  
after MBSR as compared to usual care (d=0.66).

One mechanism hypothesized to account for reduced pain is that enhanced  
mindfulness leads to ‘uncoupling’ of the cognitive and emotional elements from  
the sensory experience of chronic pain, which results in decreased distress and  
suffering18; it has been proposed that the affective component of pain can be  
distinguished  from  pain  intensity,  and  that  the  affective  component  can  be  
differentially targeted19. Data from both correlational and experimental studies  
performed in chronic pain populations suggest that enhanced mindfulness is  
associated with reduced pain intensity ratings.12,20,[ADDRESS_813637].22 Other research has found that anxiety decreases pain  
threshold and lowers pain tolerance.23 Thus, interventions that reduce anxiety  
would be expected to lead to reductions in pain severity.
For fatigue, a meta-analysis of MBIs  found that participation in an MBI led to  
improvement in symptoms for somatoform disorders (a categorization similar to  
CMI), including both fatigue and pain.[ADDRESS_813638] (d=0.93) as well as in  
pre-post designs (d=0.84, d=1.6),21  which are consistent with our pi[INVESTIGATOR_20732].  
Reappraisal of thoughts and feelings that contribute to fatigue, as taught in MBIs,  
is theorized to lead to cognitive and behavioral changes that lessen fatigue. 21
CMI can also include decrements in concentration, memory, and mood. There  
is evidence of a negative correlation between measures of mindfulness and  
cognitive failures24-26 which is consistent with our pi[INVESTIGATOR_20732]. Lapses in attention  
and memory are associated with cognitive failures in daily life, and enhanced  
mindfulness, which involves consciously paying more thorough attention to what  
is at hand, may lead to a reduction in these common errors and mishaps.26 
Additionally, mood disturbances often occur in CMI,27 and multiple prior studies of  
MBIs28 indicate improvement in depressive symptoms.
(A more thorough review of the evidence supporting this research is provided  
in the study grant, which is included in the application packet.)
We will not be including any vulnerable populations in our research, except  
for pregnant women. There is no scientifically supported or theoretical reason to  
believe  that  participation  in  the  MBSR  or  CDSMP  group,  or  other  study  
procedures, would pose special risk to a pregnant woman or her fetus.  Given the  
reasons that are supported for believing participation in either of these groups  
v.8, 02/26/2020 Page 7 of 25
 VA Puget Sound IRB 2
Effective Date: June 17, 2021
could provide benefit to a pregnant woman, we will not exclude this population  
(although we are not targeting them specifically with any recruitment materials).
3.0Objectives
The  purpose  of  this  study  is  to  determine  whether  there  is  clinical  
evidence  to  support  the  use  of  Mindfulness-Based  Stress  Reduction  as  a  
treatment for Veterans with Chronic Multi-Symptom Illness: pain, fatigue, and  
cognitive or mood disturbances. 
Hypothesis One (re: outcomes): Participants randomized to CDSMP will  
derive  benefit  for  the  primary  outcomes,  but  with  smaller  effects  than  the  
participants randomized to MBSR. We hypothesize that Veterans randomized to  
MBSR will report significantly greater reduction in each of the three primary  
outcome measures (pain, fatigue and cognitive failures) at 6-month follow-up as  
compared to aCDSMP.
Hypothesis  Two  (re:  acceptability):  MBSR  will  be  an  acceptable  and  
satisfactory program for Veterans with CMI, as indicated by [CONTACT_613469], a  
self-report measure of satisfaction, and qualitative interviews. We hypothesize  
that Veterans with CMI randomized to MBSR will report greater satisfaction with  
care than their peers randomized to CDSMP.
4.0Resources and Personnel

5.0Study Procedures
5.1 Study Design
This study is a randomized controlled trial comparing Mindfulness-Based Stress  
Reduction  (MBSR)  with  an  active  control,  augmented  Chronic  Disease  Self-
Management  Program  (aCDSMP),  to  assess  the  efficacy  of  MBSR  for  Gulf  War  
Veterans with Chronic Multi-symptom Illness (CMI). GW Veterans (n=154) with CMI will  
be randomized to either 8 weeks of MBSR (n=77) or aCDSMP (n=77). All participants  
will complete assessments at baseline, immediately post-treatment, as well as at 3-
months  and  6-months  post-treatment.  They  will  also  complete  a  short  Midpoint  
assessment halfway through the class series. 
Brief  semi-structured  interviews  will  also  be  included  in  the  MBSR/CDSMP  
assessments of the Gulf War veterans at the post-test time to collect data for qualitative  
analysis.  The  qualitative  analysis  will  be  conducted  to  develop  a  more  complete  
understanding of the acceptability and satisfaction with MBSR and aCDSMP by [CONTACT_613471]. These interviews will be conducted on a subset of GW Veterans who either  
complete or fail to complete (attend fewer than 4 class sessions) for both MBSR and  
CDSMP. For Veterans who discontinue treatment, interviews will be conducted within  
v.8, 02/26/2020 Page 10 of 25
 VA Puget Sound IRB 2
Effective Date: June 17, [ADDRESS_813640] a comparison of the  
notes,  taped  interviews  and  transcripts  to  assess  the  following:  interview  protocol  
adherence, creditability of memos and notes, and detection of leading questions and  
produce  a  quality  assurance  report  that  will  be  presented  to  the  research  team  
members.
A comprehensive outline of the various data collection tools/measured to be  
administered  at  each  of  the  four  assessments  is  provided  in  Section  5.5  Study  
Evaluations. 
The active control, aCDSMP, will account for the non-specific elements of MBSR  
(e.g. group support, positive expectancy). The standard CDSMP program is a group-
based  [ADDRESS_813641] CDSMP so that each intervention will be of  
identical duration and structure. Fidelity coding from audiotapes will evaluate protocol  
adherence for both MBSR and CDSMP. Similar to MBSR, CDSMP is taught by [CONTACT_23872],  
experienced  facilitators  who  believe  in  the  benefit  of  the  program;  allegiance  of  
researchers or therapi[INVESTIGATOR_613458] a predictor of treatment outcomes.
Risk and Benefit: The risks for this study involve the potential for psychological  
distress associated with collection of self-report data and the qualitative interview, and  
the possibility that undergoing either the MBSR class or CDSMP could be stressful and  
worsen  symptoms.  Further,  there  is  a  risk  that  MBSR  and  CDSMP  will  not  be  
efficacious for some individuals. We plan to educate patients about the possible risks  
and  benefits  prior  to  study  enrollment  by  [CONTACT_1541]  a  thorough  orientation  to  the  
research  and  an  overview  of  each  intervention  prior  to  giving  informed  consent.  
Potential benefits for those randomized to either condition may take the form of reduced  
CMI symptoms, and increased health-related quality of life. Veterans’ families may also  
benefit as a result of the shift in emotional state. However, a participant may not benefit  
directly from participation in the study. Information gained in the study may be of benefit  
in the future to persons with CMI.  Specific measures for minimizing risk are outlined  
below.
Procedures to Minimize Risk to Subjects and Protect Confidentiality:
v.8, 02/26/2020 Page 11 of 25
 VA Puget Sound IRB 2
Effective Date: June 17, 2021
1)Group sessions will include reminders to patients that they can choose what they  
will and will not do, and that it can be flexible in meeting an individual’s needs  
(e.g. in MBSR a patient may meditate with eyes open, choose not to lie down,  
shorten the meditation time, choose not to practice some of the yoga postures,  
etc., while in aCDSMP a patient may choose to share more or less of their  
personal material with the group, etc.)
2)If a research subject experiences distress or worsening of his/her condition, we  
will  consult  the  individual’s  primary  provider  for  assistance.  If  the  condition  
involves  a  psychiatric  emergency,  we  will  utilize  the  psychiatric  emergency  
services available in order to help stabilize the Veteran’s condition. If needed, the  
Veteran can be admitted to a psychiatric inpatient unit for further care. The  
Veteran will not bear any additional costs for care.
3)Any decision to withdraw from the protocol due to suicidality, depression, anxiety  
or increased PTSD symptoms will be made on a case by [CONTACT_413], with input  
from the Veteran and his/her mental health provider. If there is clear evidence of  
decompensation  or  functional  regression  that  is  considered  likely  to  lead  to  
unsafe behavior, the Veteran will be advised that another course of treatment  
could be better for them, and the study staff will assist them in making that  
change.
4)Confidentiality:  We  plan  to  maintain  the  confidentiality  of  patient  records  as  
described  above  in  the  Source  of  Materials  section.  If  at  any  point  in  the  
recruitment process or during the course of the study, a participate appears to be  
at risk to themselves or others we will initiate a series of harm-prevention steps,  
which will include a licensed psychologist in the State of Washington assessing  
the patient, short term contracts with the participant, calling the Mental Health  
Professional  (Crisis  Line)  to  discuss  the  situation,  as  well  as  informing  our  
Human Subjects committee administrator. If necessary, a referral will be made to  
the appropriate agency. Any serious adverse events will be immediately reported  
to the IRB and the Data Safety Monitor.
5)Since  studies  with  trauma  exposed  populations  have  found  that  some  
participants experience unexpected levels of distress following participation in the  
research, we will take the following steps to minimize this possibility: We will  
state clearly in the consent forms that participation in the research study may  
involve  discussing  details  about  traumatic  events  and  about  symptoms.  In  
addition, at the beginning and end of each of the assessment sessions, we will  
provide participants with time to ask questions. We will inform participants, both  
prior  to  the  initial  screening  questions  on  the  phone  and  prior  to  beginning  
treatment,  that  some  individuals  do  experience  increases  in  symptoms  after  
discussing aspects of the traumatic experience and that if these symptoms do  
not return to their prior levels within a few days, participants are encouraged to  
call the Primary Investigators. We will provide all participants with a study phone  
v.8, 02/26/2020 Page 12 of 25
 VA Puget Sound IRB 2
Effective Date: June 17, 2021
number they can use to alert us if they are experiencing distress. The phones will  
be checked daily for messages and distressed participants will be called the  
same day (for calls made during business hours or the next business day for  
after hour calls). Lastly, all participants will be provided with the county crisis  
clinic phone numbers and the VA suicide hotline so that they can reach someone  
immediately should they feel they need immediate assistance. 
6)If  any  point  in  the  study  during  the  assessments  or  treatment  sessions  a  
participant endorses suicidality or homicidality, the group instructor(s) will notify  
the PI ([CONTACT_137229]), or [CONTACT_613483], who will contact [CONTACT_102]. Drs. Simpson  
and Fennell are licensed Clinical Psychologists with extensive experience in  
assessment and treatment of Veterans. Should there be concern about risk of  
harm, a clinical interview will be conducted to assess level of risk and need for  
intervention. Participants who indicate acute suicidality or homicidality including a  
plan will be immediately referred for VA mental health services. It is important to  
note that in more than [ADDRESS_813642] never had to  
make an involuntary admission or report.
7)All data and other information in this study will be maintained confidentiality, but  
will not be anonymous due to the longitudinal nature of participation. Detailed  
contact [CONTACT_613472]. Due to the sensitive nature of the study, i.e., the assessment  
of PTSD, depression, alcohol, and substance use, several steps will be in place  
for data collection and storage to protect participant confidentiality. First, a unique  
ID  code  (PIN)  is  given  to  each  participant,  serving  to  link  their  information  
together in the on-line database. No names or identifying information will ever be  
stored in the on-line database or data files that will later be used for statistical  
analyses. All information transferred between client and server machines will be  
secured  in  a  restricted  VA  network  folder.  We  have  previously  used  these  
procedures to conduct web-based assessment of sensitive and illegal behaviors.
8)Participants' names, addresses, and phone numbers will be accessible to project  
staff in order to engage in telephone contacts and to schedule study visits with  
participants. However, these data will be kept separate from actual study data  
and from study ID codes. These data will not be shared with individuals who are  
not directly involved in the study. All participant data will be coded in a way that  
does not contain any participant identifiers. The data safety and monitoring plan  
is described below.
9)Participants may refuse to be recorded for the assessments without jeopardizing  
their participation in the study. However, due to the group nature of MBSR and of  
aCDSMP, those who are unwilling to be in an MBSR class or CDSMP group that  
is being audiotaped will need to seek other services.
v.8, 02/26/2020 Page 13 of 25
 VA Puget Sound IRB 2
Effective Date: June 17, 2021
10)In addition, as per VA regulations, each participant will have their participation in  
the study documented in the Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS; i.e.,  
enrollment  as well as completion or early termination). No session notes or  
assessment information will be included. Access to VA medical records is strictly  
controlled  and  only  VA  affiliated  individuals  who  have  undergone  extensive  
background checks and have either clinical privileges or clinical research access  
may enter the system  
5.[ADDRESS_813643] half (n=154) of whom will be Gulf War  
Veterans with CMI. The remaining subjects will be non-GW Veterans with CMI. 
In order to provide groups that are the same size as typi[INVESTIGATOR_613459], we plan to form MBSR/aCDSMP groups of up to [ADDRESS_813644] been recruited (i.e., [ADDRESS_813645]; these 30 Veterans will be randomized in equal proportion to  
MBSR or aCDSMP). (As of July 2020 groups will be capped at 10 per group, in order to  
meet the recommended class size for remote instruction.)  However, in order to allow us  
to answer additional scientific questions about CMI outcomes among non-GW Veterans,  
and because we think it could be challenging to form cohorts comprised entirely of GW  
Veterans (which would require recruitment of 30 GW Veterans per cohort), we designed  
the study so that only approximately half of each cohort (15 Veterans) will be GW  
Veterans. ([ADDRESS_813646] July 2020)  The remaining 15 Veterans in each cohort  
will be Veterans who meet all other inclusion / exclusion criteria (including presence of  
CMI) but who were not deployed during the GW.  The non-GW Veterans will complete  
the same study measures at the same points as described for GW Veterans throughout  
this application, but non-GW Veterans are not considered in the power calculations for  
the primary study hypotheses.  We think that this approach provides the ability to  
answer  additional  questions  (described  below)  while  simultaneously  enhancing  the  
feasibility of the study.
The  recruitment  strategy  described  above  affords  several  practical  and  
theoretical advantages, including:  1) it will allow groups of sufficient size (30 Veterans  
per cohort) to be formed more easily, which will assure that there will be enough  
participants in each study cohort to allow the groups to proceed; 2) as part of an

exploratory aim, it will allow assessment of outcomes for Veterans with CMI who are not  
GW Veterans, which will provide the opportunity to compare outcomes for GW vs. non-
GW Veterans; 3) if outcomes for non-GW Veterans are shown to be similar to GW  
Veterans, it would support a role for MBSR for Veterans with CMI more generally, and  
4) as part of ancillary analyses, it will provide enhanced statistical power to detect small  
changes in CMI outcomes for the entire population recruited (both GW and non-GW  
Veterans).
The primary mechanism of recruitment of GW Veterans will be letters and a  
pamphlet sent to Veterans with an indicator in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_613460], and who were at least [ADDRESS_813647] of potentially eligible Persian GW Veterans will be  
generated using a VistA/fileman query or a VINCI query; this meets the approval of our  
local IRB.  If they respond to the letter, they will be screened by [CONTACT_613473], which will be confirmed at an in-person baseline visit.  Using this method, in our  
pi[INVESTIGATOR_613461] (see preliminary studies) we successfully recruited 6-8  
GW Veterans per month – a rate higher than the proposed trial .  Over a 1.5 year time  
period we recruited and randomized 55 GW Veterans with CMI; we developed the  
methodology to send letters  midway through this pi[INVESTIGATOR_16080]; upon initiation of this  
method of recruitment, it markedly increased our enrollment rates.  Currently, we are  
applying the same recruitment methodology to a CSR&D trial for Veterans with PTSD,  
which has resulted in recruitment of approximately 2-5 Veterans per week ( we have 
about a 4% response rate for letters, and half of those (2% of letters sent) pass a phone  
screen for eligibility).   Extrapolating to this proposal, we would need to send out 7,700  
letters to recruit 154 GW Veterans.  We performed a data pull as preparation for this  
proposal, and found that there are 30,452 unique Veterans with a period of service of  
‘Persian GW’ who received care at VAPSHCS in FY14 and were at least 18 years old at  
the time of GW I (August, 1990). Thus, the recruitment goals are feasible.
We will apply a similar strategy to recruit non-GW Veterans with CMI.  Non-GW  
subjects will be recruited by [CONTACT_613474] a diagnosis related to 1) a chronic pain condition or 2)  a diagnosis related to  
chronic fatigue.  In a data pull performed as preparation for this proposal, there were  
29,160 unique Veterans who received care at VAPSHCS in FY14 with a diagnosis  
related to pain who could be contact[CONTACT_613475]-GW Veteran participants.  CMI 
is very common in primary care; we expect that this strategy will easily lead to an

5.3 Informed Consent Procedures
We  are  requesting  a  waiver  of  informed  consent  for  recruitment/screening  
purposes only. This will allow us to create recruitment mailing lists that can target the  
most-likely-to-be-eligible populations, and not waste resources and other patients’ time  
advertising the study to patients who won’t be eligible to participate.  
We will obtain informed consent prior to beginning any data collection study  
procedures that will be maintained for analysis. Informed consent will take place at the  
beginning of the appointment that includes the subject’s in-person screening and (if still  
eligible)  baseline  assessments.   The  study  coordinator,  project  manager,  or  other  
approved researcher administering the screening and baseline measures will obtain  
informed consent at this time.  We will not be enrolling anyone with impaired decision  
making ability who requires the use of a legally authorized representative.  
All study personnel will be trained in human subjects protections requirements as  
required by R&D (e.g. Privacy Policy & HIPAA training), and the PI [INVESTIGATOR_613462]. 
5.4 Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria
Inclusion  criteria :  All participants  (both  GW  and  non-GW  Veterans)  must  meet 
criteria for CMI, defined as self-report of at least two of the following 1) fatigue that limits  
usual activity; 2) musculoskeletal pain involving two or more regions of the body; 3)  
cognitive symptoms (memory, concentration, or mood disturbances).[ADDRESS_813652] been deployed to the GW theater of operations between 8/1990 – 8/1991,

 VA Puget Sound IRB 2
Effective Date: June 17, [ADDRESS_813653] symptoms of CMI that began after 8/1990, lasted at least 6 months, and are  
present at the time of the interview.
Exclusion  criteria:  At  baseline,  the  MINI  psychiatric  interview75 will  determine 
psychiatric exclusion criteria: 1) current psychotic disorder; 2) current bipolar affective  
disorder with mania;  3)  current  suicidal or homicidal  ideation.   Additional exclusion  
criteria include a chart diagnosis of borderline or antisocial personality disorder or prior  
formal participation in MBSR or CDSMP.   We will include subjects with the entire range  
of alcohol SUD (defined by [CONTACT_42145]), but exclude those for whom alcohol use poses a  
safety threat (defined as current drinking and a past-year history of alcohol-related  
seizures or delirium tremens).   We will also exclude current DSM-V substance use  
disorder other than cannabis or nicotine, as well as inpatient psychiatric admission  
within  the past  month.  Medication,  supportive  individual or  group  counseling,  case  
management,  and  self-help  programs  will  be  allowed  and  assessed  as  potential  
covariates. As of July 2020, participants must have the required technology in order to  
participate in VVC intervention groups.

threshold of clinical significance when assessing patient reported outcomes, including  
pain and physical and emotional functioning.8   The literature (see section on MBIs for  
CMI), and our  pi[INVESTIGATOR_10299] (preliminary studies section) suggest medium to large effect  
sizes for CMI, supporting the feasibility of detecting this level of difference.  Although  
effect sizes derived from small samples are inherently unreliable,[ADDRESS_813657]

this final sample size for a recruitment goal of 154 GW Veterans with CMI. This attrition  
estimate is conservative; it is slightly greater than in on our pi[INVESTIGATOR_613463].3 The sample size required  per arm of the study (at 80% and 90% power) is  
presented across a range of effect sizes (Table 3).97  
Intraclass  correlation  (ICC):   our  pi[INVESTIGATOR_613464]  
(preliminary studies) showed an ICC for primary outcomes of ρ= 0.00 at follow-up.  
Because our data do not indicate significant ICCs for any of the primary outcome  
measures, the proposed analyses do not incorporate ICC results and are not powered  
to account for them.
Qualitative data will be coded (a sort of pre-analysis) continuously as participants  
complete their qualitative interviews; when saturation is reached, and no new codes are  
being generated, the research team will stop conducting the interviews and begin to  
analyze the qualitative data more extensively. The Project Manager and [CONTACT_613488] will be primarily involved in the qualitative data analysis. 
Quantitative  data  will  be  analyzed  following  the  completion  of  the  final  
assessments of the last subject cohort, which is projected to take place in the last six  
months of Year Four of the study.  The dataset will be analyzed by [CONTACT_613476], in  
consultation with [CONTACT_374857].
5.[ADDRESS_813661]’s participation in the study will be  
withdrawn from the research without their consent. 
If  a  subject  wishes  to  withdraw  from  the  study  before  all  procedures  are  
complete,  he  or  she  simply  needs  to  notify  the  study’s  project  manager,  study  
coordinator, or other study team member by [CONTACT_613477], and the subject with be withdrawn fro the study and no longer

6.0Reporting
When an unexpected serious adverse event occurs, we will log it in an “Adverse  
Events & Problems” log, to be used for providing reports to the Data Safety Monitoring  
Board (DSMB), in addition to submitting a report to the IRB within 5 days as required.  
All other adverse events, problems, and protocol deviations will be logged and reported  
to the Safety Monitor and the IRB with annual reviews.
Adverse  Events  related  to  worsening  depression  symptoms  will  be  actively  
monitored by [CONTACT_613479]-9 scores. We will define as an AE an increase in PHQ-9  
depression  score  by  2  or  more  severity  categories.  For  example,  if  a  patient  
experiences an increase in depression from moderate to severe, this would be an  
increase in two categories of severity.   The PHQ-9 categorizes depression as none,  
mild, moderate, moderately severe, and severe according to the total score; this has  
been previously validated. At the midpoint of the study, the data monitor would then  
analyze whether significantly greater adverse events occur in one arm of the study,  
which might warrant stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_10098].
7.0Privacy and Confidentiality
The  study  will  obtain  Protected  Health  Information  by  [CONTACT_613480]  (e.g.  
medications and other treatment relevant to the symptoms evaluated for the study) from  
the subjects’ CPRS records, as well as contact [CONTACT_3031] (PII) for following up with  
subjects regarding ongoing study procedures.  Health information will also be collected  
through the questionnaires and interviews. This health information will be maintained as  
de-identified study data, and will not be disclosed to unauthorized entities.  We will be  
obtaining a Certificate of Confidentiality for this study, as we ask about substance use.
A password-protected crosswalk will be maintained to link identifying information (full  
names and last 4 SSN) to study subjects’ unique study IDs (e.g. 695-001, 695-002, 695-
003….695-308).  All files containing study data, hard copy or electronic, will include only  
the subject’s study ID so that no data can be linked directly to an individual.  All study  
team members, as VA employees (WOC or otherwise) are required to undergo Privacy  
& HIPAA training as well as VA Privacy and Information Security Awareness and Rules  
of Behavior.  Any non-VA-affiliated study team members will be required to undergo  
equivalent training.  Only study team members will have access to the electronic study

folder, located on the R: drive on the VA server. Hard copy data and consent forms will  
be stored in locked filing cabinets in the offices of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or the Project Manager.
8.0Communication Plan
N/A, this is not a multi-site research project.
9.[ADDRESS_813663]’s study enrollment period will be gathered from accessing CPRS and  
recording the information on a hard copy paper, linked to the participant by [CONTACT_613481], which will be filed in a locked researcher file cabinet (in the office of the  
Project Manager or the PI).  Consent forms and other hard copy documents with  
identifying information (e.g. emergency contact [CONTACT_3264]) will be filed in separate  
hanging folders from any documents with study IDs and study data on them, so  
that the identifying information cannot be linked to the corresponding data. 
Data  from  self-report  measures  will  be  collected  through  an  MS  Access  
database. The administering researcher will open the database from the study  
folder on a VA computer, and then the participants will fill out the questionnaires.  
Each set of questionnaires will be linked to subjects through their study IDs or  
other unique identifiers (no PII recorded in the MS Access database), and these  
identifiers will be recorded and tracked by [CONTACT_3476].  When needed, a  
report or query of these outcome/response data from these questionnaires will be  
generated from MS Access and saved to the study folder.
Audio files from the qualitative interviews will be available to certified medical  
transcriptionists  through  secure  VA  folders;  all  transcriptionists  are  VA  
employees.   Additionally, the interviewer does not use the name [CONTACT_613482]. 
Participants  in  VVC  interventions  will  be  notified  about  the  limits  to  
confidentiality inherent in an internet delivered group format at the time of their  
consenting.

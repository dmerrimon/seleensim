 Specific Aims
 
Provoked VTE is traditionally considered a transient acute disorder requiring a limited 
duration of anticoagulant therapy.  Patients who suffer deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or 
pulmonary embolism (PE) following major surgery, major trauma, or periods of 
immobility are generally treated with time-limited anticoagulation for [ADDRESS_33595] recently been recognized as a heterogeneous 
population comprised of those with transient provoking and persistent provoking risk 
factors (1).  Common risk factors in provoked VTE such as obesity, immobility, 
atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, heart failure, chronic lung disease, chronic 
kidney disease, and inflammatory disorders frequently contribute to an enduring 
rather than transient risk.   
 
Data from 4,[ADDRESS_33596] a reduction in recurrence with extended duration 
anticoagulation compared with low-dose aspi[INVESTIGATOR_34203] (1.5% vs. 4.9%) (2,3).  
Common persistent provoking factors included immobility, obesity, heart failure, and 
prevalent, persistent provoking factors are rarely considered when stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_34204] 3- to 
6-month duration of therapy.  The [ADDRESS_33597] Physicians 
(ACCP) Guidelines on Antithrombotic Therapy for VTE do not distinguish between 
transient and persistent provoking risk factors and recommend limited-duration 
anticoagulation for provoked events (4). 
 
However, an emerging opi[INVESTIGATOR_34205] (5).  Such a strategy breaks from the tradition of dichotomizing VTE 
as provoked or unprovoked.  Rather, persisting risk factors such as heart failure, 
obesity, family history of VTE, acquired or hereditary thrombophilia, and 
immobilization are incorporated into the decision-making process for pathways 
focused on secondary prevention.  A suitable long-term strategy for secondary 
prevention has been recommended in evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for 
patients with unprovoked VTE (4).  Extended-duration anticoagulation with warfarin or 
the direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) is validated and recommended for prevention 
of recurrent unprovoked VTE in patients with a low-risk of bleeding (6).  In a landmark 
extension trial of patients with unprovoked VTE, the AMPLIFY-EXT trial compared 
two doses of api[INVESTIGATOR_3822] (2.5 mg and 5 mg, twice daily) with placebo in 2486 patients 
with VTE who had completed 6 to 12 months of anticoagulation therapy and for 
whom there was clinical equipoise regarding the need for extended-duration 
anticoagulant therapy for secondary prevention (7).  Symptomatic recurrent VTE or 
death from VTE occurred in 73 of the 829 patients (8.8%) who were receiving 
placebo versus 14 of the 840 patients (1.7%) who were receiving 2.5 mg of api[INVESTIGATOR_34206] 14 of the 813 patients (1.7%) who were receiving 5 mg of api[INVESTIGATOR_3822] (p<0.001 for 
both comparisons). In Kaplan-Meier analysis, the api[INVESTIGATOR_3822] 2.[ADDRESS_33598] 3, 2020 
12 
 regimen demonstrated a major and clinically-relevant nonmajor bleeding rate similar
to that of placebo.   
 
Based on the emerging evidence that provoked VTE patients may require extended-
duration anticoagulation for secondary prevention, the api[INVESTIGATOR_3822] 2.5 mg twice daily 
dose could be a critical addition to our armamentarium in those at high risk for 
recurrence at the transition of care from the acute to the chronic treatment phase.  
However, this hypothesis needs to be tested in a randomized clinical trial.  We 
propose a single-center, randomized placebo-controlled trial conducted at Brigham 
BWH) to evaluate the impact of low-dose api[INVESTIGATOR_3822] (2.5 mg 
twice daily) in a study population exclusively comprised of provoked VTE patients 
with at least one persistent provoking factor.  We have the following study aims: 
 
Specific Aim #1:  To compare the 12-month rate of recurrent symptomatic VTE in 
patients with provoked VTE and at least one persistent provoking factor who are 
randomized to either api[INVESTIGATOR_3822] (2.5 mg orally twice daily) as monotherapy or placebo 
after completing at least [ADDRESS_33599] a low 
risk of bleeding. 
 
Hypothesis #1:  Compared with placebo, oral api[INVESTIGATOR_3822] (2.5 mg twice daily) will 
reduce the 12-month rate of symptomatic VTE in patients with provoked VTE and at 
least one persistent provoking factor who have completed at least [ADDRESS_33600] a low risk of bleeding. 
 
Specific Aim #2:  To compare the 12-month rate of ISTH major bleeding in patients 
with provoked VTE and at least one persistent provoking factor who are randomized 
to either api[INVESTIGATOR_3822] (2.5 mg orally twice daily) as monotherapy or placebo after 
completing at least [ADDRESS_33601] a low risk 
of bleeding. 
 
Hypothesis #2:  Compared with placebo, oral api[INVESTIGATOR_3822] (2.5 mg twice daily) will be 
associated with a similar rate of ISTH major bleeding at [ADDRESS_33602] one persistent provoking factor who are randomized to 
either api[INVESTIGATOR_3822] (2.5 mg orally twice daily) as monotherapy or placebo after 
completing at least [ADDRESS_33603] 3, 2020

 Introduction and Background
 
Provoked venous thromboembolism (VTE) is traditionally considered a transient 
acute disorder requiring a limited duration of anticoagulant therapy.  Patients who 
suffer deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) following major 
surgery, major trauma, or periods of immobility are generally treated with time-limited 
anticoagulation for [ADDRESS_33604] recently been 
recognized as a heterogeneous population comprised of those with transient 
provoking and persistent provoking risk factors (1).  Common risk factors in provoked 
VTE such as obesity, immobility, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, heart failure, 
chronic lung disease, chronic kidney disease, and inflammatory disorders frequently 
contribute to an enduring rather than transient risk.  Furthermore, epi[INVESTIGATOR_34207] (8,9) and the randomized clinical trial EINSTEIN CHOICE (3) suggest that 
VTE is best characterized as a chronic disorder with periodic relapses.  A landmark 
Danish National Registry analysis demonstrated that patients who suffer provoked or 
unprovoked VTE have an increased risk of recurrence over the ensuing 30 years and 
that recurrent PE causes increased mortality (10).  While the rate of VTE recurrence 
ranges 30-50% over 10 years for unprovoked VTE (also termed idiopathic; 
unprovoked implies that an immediate trigger for the VTE cannot be identified), 
recurrent events occur in about 20% of patients over 10 years after a provoked event 
(provoked VTE is defined as post-operative, post-major trauma, post-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], 
or related to pregnancy, hormonal contraception/replacement therapy, or immobility) 
(1113).  Based on these data, provoked VTE patients represent a population 
vulnerable to VTE recurrence, especially at the transition of care from the initial 
(acute) treatment phase to the chronic treatment phase, at which point 
anticoagulation is discontinued in most of these patients.   
 
The EINSTEIN CHOICE trial recently evaluated the safety and efficacy of regimens 
of full- or lower-intensity anticoagulant therapy versus low-dose aspi[INVESTIGATOR_34208] (2).  The EINSTEIN 
CHOICE Investigators randomly assigned 3396 patients with VTE to receive either 
once-daily rivaroxaban (at doses of 20 mg or 10 mg) or 100 mg of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248].  Prior to 
enrollment in EINSTEIN CHOICE, all study patients completed 6 to 12 months of 
anticoagulation therapy, and their providers were in equipoise regarding the need for 
extended anticoagulation.  Approximately 60% of patients in EINSTEIN CHOICE had 
suffered provoked VTE.  Symptomatic recurrent VTE occurred in 17 of 1107 patients 
(1.5%) receiving 20 mg of rivaroxaban and in 13 of 1127 patients (1.2%) receiving 10 
mg of rivaroxaban, and in 50 of 1131 patients (4.4%) receiving low-dose aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] 
(hazard ratio for 20 mg of rivaroxaban vs. aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], 0.34; 95% confidence interval [CI], 
0.20 to 0.59; hazard ratio for 10 mg of rivaroxaban vs. aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], 0.26; 95% CI, 0.14 to 
0.47; P<0.001 for both comparisons).  Rates of major bleeding were similar (0.5% in 
the group receiving 20 mg of rivaroxaban, 0.4% in the group receiving 10 mg of 
rivaroxaban, and 0.3% in the low-dose aspi[INVESTIGATOR_34209]) (2).   
 
Data from 4,[ADDRESS_33605] a reduction in recurrence with extended duration anticoagulation 
compared with low-dose aspi[INVESTIGATOR_34203] (1.5% vs. 4.9%) (2,3).  Common 
persistent provoking factors included immobility, obesity, heart failure, and chronic 
 and rheumatoid arthritis.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_34210], persistent provoking factors are rarely considered when 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_34211] 3- to 6-month duration of therapy.  The [ADDRESS_33606] 
Physicians (ACCP) Guidelines on Antithrombotic Therapy for VTE do not distinguish 
between transient and persistent provoking risk factors and recommend limited-
duration anticoagulation for provoked events (4). 
 
However, an emerging opi[INVESTIGATOR_34205] (5).  Such a strategy breaks from the tradition of dichotomizing VTE 
as provoked or unprovoked.  Rather, persisting risk factors such as heart failure, 
obesity, family history of VTE, acquired or hereditary thrombophilia, and 
immobilization are incorporated into the decision-making process for pathways 
focused on secondary prevention. 
 
A suitable long-term strategy for secondary prevention has been recommended in 
evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for patients with unprovoked VTE (4).  
Extended-duration anticoagulation with warfarin or the direct oral anticoagulants 
(DOACs) is validated and recommended for prevention of recurrent unprovoked VTE 
in patients with a low-risk of bleeding (6).  However, current evidence-based clinical 
practice guidelines are inadequate for secondary prevention in patients with provoked 
VTE based on several extended-duration anticoagulation trials that included patients 
with provoked and unprovoked VTE.  In a randomized controlled trial of rivaroxaban 
for extended-duration secondary prevention in patients with either provoked (26%) or 
unprovoked (74%) DVT, recurrent VTE occurred in 8 patients (1.3%) in the 
rivaroxaban group compared with 42 patients (7.1%) in the placebo group (hazard 
ratio, 0.18; 95% CI, 0.09 to 0.39; P<0.001, relative risk reduction, 82%) (3).   
 
In a landmark extension trial of patients with unprovoked VTE, the AMPLIFY-EXT trial 
compared two doses of api[INVESTIGATOR_3822] (2.5 mg and 5 mg, twice daily) with placebo in 2486 
patients with VTE who had completed 6 to 12 months of anticoagulation therapy and 
for whom there was clinical equipoise regarding the need for extended-duration 
anticoagulant therapy for secondary prevention (7).  Symptomatic recurrent VTE or 
death from VTE occurred in 73 of the 829 patients (8.8%) who were receiving 
placebo versus 14 of the 840 patients (1.7%) who were receiving 2.5 mg of api[INVESTIGATOR_34206] 14 of the 813 patients (1.7%) who were receiving 5 mg of api[INVESTIGATOR_3822] (p<0.001 for 
both comparisons). In Kaplan-Meier analysis, the api[INVESTIGATOR_3822] 2.5 mg twice daily 
regimen demonstrated a major and clinically-relevant nonmajor bleeding rate similar 
to that of placebo.  While approximately 9% of the patients in the AMPLIFY-EXT trial 
had transient or reversible risk factors for VTE, the provoked VTE population only 
accounted for approximately 200 patients and precluded a well-powered analysis.  
Furthermore, the intent of the AMPLIFY-EXT trial was to study unprovoked VTE (7).  
HI-PRO Trial    
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_3818], et al.  
August 3, [ADDRESS_33607] of VTE secondary 
prevention.  Rather than using the simple dichotomized view of VTE as provoked or 
unprovoked, HI-PRO is focusing on how the risk of recurrence in patients with 
persisting provoking factors may be modulated by [CONTACT_6398]-dose api[INVESTIGATOR_3822].  The 
foundation of this question is based on the current direction in which the field of VTE 
is moving (5) and supported by [CONTACT_34319]-sound ISTH 
classification of risk factors (1). 
 
Api[INVESTIGATOR_3822] 2.[ADDRESS_33608] additional advantages for extended-duration 
secondary prevention of VTE compared with rivaroxaban 10 mg daily (which has U.S. 
FDA approval for extended-duration therapy).  Api[INVESTIGATOR_34212] a more 
pharmacokinetically rational regimen, given the half-life of these two DOACs.  In trials 
of stroke prevention of atrial fibrillation, api[INVESTIGATOR_34213] a relatively lower 
frequency of gastrointestinal bleeding compared with warfarin (14 17).  Api[INVESTIGATOR_34214]-target side effects than rivaroxaban, which can cause severe headache 
(necessitating urgent head CT) and severe rash.   
 
Based on the emerging evidence that provoked VTE patients may require extended-
duration anticoagulation for secondary prevention, the api[INVESTIGATOR_3822] 2.5 mg twice daily 
dose could be a critical addition to our armamentarium in those at high risk for 
recurrence at the transition of care from the acute to the chronic treatment phase.  
However, this hypothesis needs to be tested in a clinical trial.  We propose a single-
(BWH) to evaluate the feasibility of low-dose api[INVESTIGATOR_3822] (2.5 mg twice daily) in a study 
population exclusively comprised of provoked VTE patients with persistently 
provoking risk factors for VTE. 
 
 
Rationale for the Proposed Study and Trial Design 
 
The rationale for the study design is focused on the lack of data on the safety and 
efficacy of extended-duration low-dose api[INVESTIGATOR_34215].  A single-center, randomized placebo-controlled trial of extended 
low-intensity api[INVESTIGATOR_34216] a study population enriched for recurrent VTE event rates 
will be able to provide such data.   
 
The rationale for a single-center study is that Watkins Cardiovascular Clinic at BWH 
is a Center of Excellence for thrombosis care not only in the New England region but 
also along the East coast.  The BWH Thrombosis Center evaluates an average of 
[ADDRESS_33609], low-dose 
rivaroxaban 10 mg orally daily was effective and safe in the EINSTEIN CHOICE trial 
(2) for extended-duration anticoagulation in secondary prevention after unprovoked 
VTE.  Second, AMPLIFY-EXT demonstrated efficacy and enhanced safety to a low-
dose api[INVESTIGATOR_34217] (2.5 mg orally twice daily) for extended-duration 
anticoagulation in secondary prevention after predominantly unprovoked VTE (7).  
Finally, because the relative risk of recurrence is less (although still unacceptably 
high) for provoked VTE than unprovoked VTE, a lower dose of api[INVESTIGATOR_34218] a reduction in the risk of major and clinically-relevant 
non-major bleeding. 
 
The rationale for using low-dose api[INVESTIGATOR_34219] a study population that will include 
obese patients is that an analysis of the AMPLIFY-EXT data by [CONTACT_34320] (7). 
 
The rationale for using a placebo-control is that current evidence-based guidelines do 
not recommend any extended thromboprophylactic measures after provoked VTE.  
Trials of low-dose aspi[INVESTIGATOR_34220] a mixed population of unprovoked and provoked VTE.  In the 
EINSTEIN CHOICE trial, low-dose aspi[INVESTIGATOR_34221] a bleeding risk similar 
to anticoagulation with rivaroxaban and a recurrent VTE rate 70% higher than 
anticoagulation with rivaroxaban (2). 
 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_34222].  First, the HI-PRO trial will include atherosclerotic 
cardiovascular disease, which will enrich the study population in VTE events because 
of the strong pathophysiological link between the two (18 21).  Many of these 
patients will be receiving low-
eligible patients will be receiving low-
cardiovascular events.  Excluding these patients would significantly hinder 
enrollment.  Finally, none of the major landmark trials of low-intensity api[INVESTIGATOR_3822] (2.5 
mg twice daily) excluded patients taking low- -EXT 
and ADOPT allowed up to 165 mg of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_34223] (7,22).   
 
Atherosclerosis is associated with an increased risk of VTE.  A link between 
atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and VTE was first suggested by [CONTACT_34321], who observed that the presence of carotid plaque was associated with a 
doubling in VTE risk (23).  Many risk factors for VTE, such as obesity, hypertension, 
dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], diabetes, and smoking, overlap with those for atherosclerosis (21,24).  
The link between VTE and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease also appears to be 
reciprocal.  A recent analysis of TRA2P-TIMI 50 (Thrombin Receptor Antagonist in 
Secondary Prevention of Atherothrombotic Ischemic Events-Thrombolysis in 
Myocardial Infarction) and PEGASUS-TIMI 54 (Prevention of Cardiovascular Events 
in Patients With Prior Heart Attack Using Ticagrelor Compared to Placebo on a 
Background of Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248]-Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 54) demonstrated the 
HI-PRO Trial    
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_3818], et al.  
August 3, 2020 
17 
 risk of VTE increased with the number of symptomatic vascular territories affected by 
[CONTACT_34322] (18).  A recent editorial in Circulation called for medicine to abandon 
the dichotomized view of VTE as provoked or unprovoked and called for the basis of 
the optimal duration of anticoagulation to be determined by [CONTACT_34323], 
including cardiovascular disease (5).  Because of the potential for a majority of 
patients in the study to have atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease limiting the 
generalizability of the results, up to 35% in each study group may have 
atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease as a qualifying persistent risk factor. 
 
The rationale for enrollment at 3-months is derived from the [ADDRESS_33610] Physicians (ACCP) evidence-based clinical practice document entitled 
with proximal DVT or pulmonary embolism (PE), we recommend 
long-
(Kearon C, Akl EA, Ornelas J, et al. Antithrombotic Therapy for VTE Disease: CHEST 
Guideline and Expert Panel Report. Chest 2016;149:315-52).  This statement 
supports the 3-month timepoint as an appropriate juncture to determine whether 
extended duration anticoagulation or discontinuation of antithrombotic therapy is 
appropriate.  
 
The 2016 ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines rely upon a more 
traditional classification for determining the risk of VTE recurrence after 3 months, a 
that has subsequently fallen out of favor.  The 2016 ACCP guidance document states 
the following regarding extended-duration antithrombotic therapy for prevention of 
recurrent VTE: 
 
recommend treatment with anticoagulation for 3 months over (i) treatment of a 
shorter period (Grade 1B), (ii) treatment of a longer time-limited period (eg, 6, 12, or 
24 months) (Grade 1B), or (iii) extended therapy (no scheduled stop date) (Grade 
1B). 
 
In patients with a proximal DVT of the leg or PE provoked by a nonsurgical transient 
risk factor, we recommend treatment with anticoagulation for 3 months over (i) 
treatment of a shorter period (Grade 1B) and (ii) treatment of a longer time-limited 
period (eg, 6, 12, or 24 months) (Grade 1B). We suggest treatment with 
anticoagulation for 3 months over extended therapy if there is a low or moderate 
bleeding risk (Grade 2B), and recommend treatment for [ADDRESS_33611] enduring risk factors for recurrence, such 
as those with persistent immobility, obesity, heart failure, chronic lung disease, 
chronic kidney disease, chronic inflammatory/autoimmune disorder, and 
atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (Albertsen IE, Pi[INVESTIGATOR_3818] G, Goldhaber SZ. Let's

Nielsen PB, Larsen TB. Extended oral anticoagulation after incident venous 
thromboembolism - a paradigm shift? Expert Rev Cardiovasc Ther. 2020 
Apr;18(4):201-208).   
 
More recently, the 2019 European Society of Cardiology Guidelines for the Diagnosis 
and Management of Acute Pulmonary Embolism, developed in collaboration with the 
European Respi[INVESTIGATOR_3764] (ERS), have recognized the importance of identifying 
persistent, or enduring, risk factors for VTE recurrence (Konstantinides SV, Meyer G, 
Becattini C, et al. 2019 ESC Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of acute 
pulmonary embolism developed in collaboration with the European Respi[INVESTIGATOR_16362] (ERS). Eur Heart J 2019).  This paradigm shift away from the previous 
endorsed by [CONTACT_34324] (ISTH), which 
recommends that clinicians consider persistent predisposing factors when 
determining whether to extend anticoagulation beyond 3 months (Kearon, C, Ageno, 
W, Cannegieter, SC, Cosmi, B, Geersing, G J and Kyrle, PA, for the Subcommittees 
on Control of Anticoagulation, and Predictive and Diagnostic Variables in Thrombotic 
Disease. Categorization of patients as having provoked or unprovoked venous 
thromboembolism: guidance from the SSC of ISTH. J Thromb Haemost 2016; 14: 
1480-3). 
 
Accordingly, the [ADDRESS_33613] upon recognition of 
both transient risk factors for VTE but also the presence of persistent, or enduring, 
conditions that result in a prolonged risk of VTE recurrence after an initial event.  
These include chronic medical disorders like inflammatory bowel disease, connective 
tissue disease, and other hypercoagulable states.  Rather than dichotomizing VTE 
patients in
Guidelines recommend assessment of persistent predisposing factors and an 
estimated long-term recurrence risk (if anticoagulation is discontinued after 3 
months).  The Guidelines suggest that only patients with an estimated recurrence risk 
of less than 3% per year should receive time-limited treatment (see figure below).  
Patients with greater than 8% risk of recurrence per year (for example, those with 
cancer-related VTE) are mandated to receive indefinite duration anticoagulation.  
There is clinical and research equipoise for the patient population that has an 
intermediate risk for recurrence (3-8% risk of recurrence per year). 
 
The inclusion and exclusion criteria for the current study follows the evidence-based 
clinical practice guideline recommendations from the ESC and ISTH and identify a 
population of patients with VTE who have a 3-8% of VTE recurrence per year.  We 
have estimated a 12-month VTE recurrence rate of 6% in our proposed study 
population, exactly within this range of clinical and research equipoise.

 Study Objectives
 
Primary Safety Objective:  To quantitatively assess the International Society on 
Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) major bleeding at 12 months. 
 
Primary Efficacy Objective:  To quantitatively assess the 12-month rate of 
symptomatic, recurrent VTE, defined as the composite of deep vein thrombosis 
and/or pulmonary embolism.  
  
Secondary Safety Objective:  To quantitatively assess the 12-month rate of ISTH 
clinically relevant non-major bleeding. 
 
Secondary Efficacy Objective: To quantitatively assess the composite of death due 
to cardiovascular cause, nonfatal myocardial infarction, stroke or systemic embolism, 
critical limb ischemia, or coronary or peripheral ischemia requiring revascularization 
(major adverse cardiovascular events, including major adverse limb events) at [ADDRESS_33614] a low risk of bleeding. 
 
Study Duration 
 
The study will be completed in 36 months: 2 months for start-up (including Human 
Research Committee/Institutional Review Board [IRB] approval and finalizing the 
Case Report Form), 32 months for patient enrollment, follow-up, and data collection, 
and 2 months for data analysis and writing up the results ( Table 1).

o NOTE:  Eligible patients will be allowed to have multiple risk factors, 
and there will not be a limit as to how many of the above risk factors a 
subject may have.  In addition, we will place no limit on the number of 
patients included with multiple risk factors.  A study population with 
multiple risk factors is highly representative of the provoked VTE 
population and will provide the greatest generalizability of the study 
results to real-world clinical practice.  Including patients with single and 
multiple persistent provoking risk factors will also facilitate enrollment.  
As noted, there is clinical and research equipoise regarding whether 
patients with a single or multiple persistent provoking VTE risk factors 
should receive extended duration thromboprophylaxis for secondary 
prevention.

follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level > 40mIU/mL to confirm menopause. 
 
*Females treated with hormone replacement therapy (HRT) are likely to have 
artificially suppressed FSH levels and may require a washout period in order to obtain 
a physiologic FSH level. The duration of the washout period is a function of the type 
of HRT used. The duration of the washout period below are suggested guidelines and 
the investigators should use their judgement in checking serum FSH levels. If the 
serum FSH level is > 40 mIU/ml at any time during the washout period, the woman 
can be considered postmenopausal:

Treatment Description   
 
Subjects will begin anticoagulation within 3 weeks of passing the screening 
procedure.  Subjects who are 18 years of age or older with provoked DVT and/or PE, 
have completed at least [ADDRESS_33631] one persistent provoking risk factor will be randomly 
assigned to receive api[INVESTIGATOR_3822] 2.5 mg orally twice daily or oral placebo for extended 
secondary prevention of VTE for a duration of 12 months.

 Safety Outcomes
 
Primary Safety Outcome 
 
The primary safety outcome will be major bleeding at 12 months.  Major bleeding is 
 
site, or contributes to death (27).  The primary safety outcome will be independently 
adjudicated by a blinded Clinical Endpoints Committee (CEC) review. 
 
Secondary Safety Outcome 
 
Clinically relevant non-major bleeding at 12 months will be evaluated (please see 
below) and is defined as overt bleeding that does not meet the criteria for major 
bleeding but that is associated with the need for medical intervention, unscheduled 
contact [CONTACT_4490] a physician, interruption or discontinuation of the study drug, or 
discomfort or impairment of activities of daily living (28).   
 
 
Efficacy Outcomes 
 
Primary Efficacy Outcome  
 
The primary efficacy outcome will be symptomatic, recurrent VTE, defined as the 
composite of deep vein thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism at [ADDRESS_33634] on computed tomographic (CT) venography, 
magnetic resonance (MR) venography, or contrast venography.   
 
PE is diagnosed based on new mismatched perfusion defect(s) on ventilation 
perfusion scan, the presence of a new pulmonary artery filling defect on contrast-
enhanced chest CT, a new finding of intraluminal filling defect on invasive pulmonary 
angiography, or evidence of PE at autopsy. 
 
Secondary Efficacy Outcome  
 
A secondary efficacy outcome will be the composite of death due to cardiovascular 
cause, nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), stroke or systemic embolism, critical limb 
ischemia (CLI), or coronary or peripheral ischemia requiring revascularization (major 
adverse cardiovascular events, including major adverse limb events) at [ADDRESS_33635] 2 of the 3 following conditions (29):
 The detection of a rise and/or fall of cardiac biomarkers, with at least one of 
the values being elevated (preferably cardiac troponin [cTn] with at least one 
value above the 99th percentile upper reference limit) and with at least one of 
the following:   
 symptoms of myocardial ischemia  
 new (or presumably new) significant ST-segment/T-wave changes 
or left bundle branch block  
 development of pathological Q waves on ECG  
 new loss of viable myocardium or regional wall motion abnormality 
by [CONTACT_34331] a new, focal neurologic deficit of sudden onset, lasting 
at least 24 hours, not due to a readily identifiable nonvascular cause (i.e. brain tumor, 
trauma), as confirmed by a neurologist and neuroimaging (7). All strokes during the 
study will be assessed by [CONTACT_9663], and classified as primary hemorrhagic, 
non-hemorrhagic, infarction with hemorrhagic conversion, or unknown, as defined by 
[CONTACT_9664]. 
 
 Primary hemorrhagic:  a stroke with documentation on imaging (e.g., 
CT scan or magnetic resonance imaging) of hemorrhage in the cerebral 
parenchyma, or subarachnoid hemorrhage. Evidence of hemorrhagic 
stroke obtained from lumbar puncture, neurosurgery, or autopsy can 
also confirm the diagnosis.  
 Non-hemorrhagic:  an ischemic focal neurological deficit (and not due 
to hemorrhage) that appears and is still partially evident at 24 hours. 
 Infarction with hemorrhagic conversion:  no evidence of hemorrhage 
on an initial scan, but found on a subsequent scan and is clinically 
relevant to the event, as determined by a neurologist. 
 Unknown type/no imaging performed:  the type of stroke could not be 
determined by [CONTACT_9665] (lumbar puncture, 
neurosurgery). 
 
Cardiovascular death is defined as a death for which a definite non-cardiovascular 
cause (e.g. cancer) has not been identified. Uncertain causes of deaths are 
presumed to be cardiovascular unless proven otherwise. 
 
Major adverse limb events include acute limb ischemia (ALI) and critical limb 
ischemia (CLI) (30).  Acute limb ischemia is defined as limb-threatening ischemia 
which is confirmed by [CONTACT_34332] (i.e. pharmacologic [heparin, thrombolysis], peripheral arterial 
surgery/reconstruction, peripheral angioplasty/stent, or amputation) within [ADDRESS_33636] 3, 2020 
28 
 chronic limb ischemia, peripheral vascular intervention or other peripheral vascular
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. 
 
CLI is defined as continuing ischemic limb, foot or digit pain leading to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34232], or Fontaine 3 or 4 at baseline 
with peripheral intervention during the trial. 
 
Peripheral vascular intervention is defined as peripheral vascular intervention not 
meeting the definition for ALI or CLI. 
 
Additional Study Outcomes:   Admission for heart failure will also be assessed at 12 
months.  Adherence to the twice-daily regimen of api[INVESTIGATOR_3822] (and placebo) will be 
recorded as the total number of doses taken divided by [CONTACT_34333].  Adherence data will be recorded on patient-maintained drug diaries. 
 
Clinical Endpoints Committee Adjudication of Study Outcomes 
 
Primary and secondary safety and efficacy outcome will be independently 
adjudicated by a Clinical Endpoints Committee (CEC) that is blinded with regards to 
allocation (randomization).  The CEC will include a 
chairperson and independent reviewers who are physicians with experience in 
vascular medicine and thrombosis. The CEC will adjudicate all index events (proximal 
DVT and/or PE). During the study period and the post-treatment observation period, 
the CEC will adjudicate all suspected occurrences/recurrences of venous or arterial 
thromboembolic events, deaths, and the following events of special interest: acute 
myocardial infarction, acute stroke, and thrombocytopenia. The CEC will also review 
all suspected epi[INVESTIGATOR_34233], and categorize adjudicated bleeding as major, 
clinically relevant non-major, or minor bleeding. The Committee will be provided with 
all relevant documentation related to the events 
treatment allocation. The criteria and definitions of the study outcomes as well as the 
procedures followed by [CONTACT_34334]. 
 
Drug Accountability 
 
Study drug and placebo will be physically stored at BWH in our Investigational Drug 
Pharmacy.  Drug handling and dispensing will be accomplished through our BWH 
Investigational Drug Service.  The Director of Pharmacy at BWH will oversee the 
Investigational Drug Service in this regard for the purposes of the clinical trial.  
Documentation of administration will by [CONTACT_34335] (EHR; EPIC) in addition to a patient drug diary, which is being kept to assess 
medication adherence.  The Investigational Drug Service will collect empty study drug 
containers and unused drug via mail using prepaid labels that will be provided to the 
patient or courier as per Investigational Drug Service policy.  We will perform drug 
accountability assessment when the drug containers are collected at each 3-month 
interval.   
HI-PRO Trial    
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_3818], et al.  
August 3, [ADDRESS_33637] (EPIC).   
 
When our Research Nurse conducts the every 3-month telephone call in advance of 
releasing a 3-month allotment of study drug or placebo the subject will be queried for 
any issues with the study or adverse events.  
 
We will conduct an end-of-treatment visit to obtain data relevant to the study end 
points. 
 
We will assess medication adherence via pi[INVESTIGATOR_692].  Medication adherence will be 
calculated in three month intervals as the total number of doses taken divided by [CONTACT_34336] ([ x / 180] x 100 = medication 
adherence [%]) and also for the total 360-day study period ([x / 720] x 100 = 
medication adherence [%]).  Subjects will be given a study drug diary to fill out at 
home each day.  Subjects will write down the time they take their study drug and any 
side effects.  The study drug diary will be collected at a regularly scheduled office visit 
or the end-of-treatment visit  at conclusion of the study period.  
 
Subject Retention, Withdrawal, and Termination 
 
Continued participation of study subjects will be encouraged at the time of outpatient 
evaluation through the 12-month follow-up interval.  However, study subjects will be 
informed that they retain the right to withdraw from the study at any time without 
compromise to their current or subsequent medical care.  Subjects will be terminated 
from the study if they expi[INVESTIGATOR_9607].   
 
If study subjects elect to withdraw, they will be asked for permission to do the 
following:

 Withdrawal criteria will include: 
1. Patient requests to withdraw 
2. Reasons related to SAE: 
a. Initiating or continuing study drug places the subject at undue hazard as 
determined by [CONTACT_737];   
b. SAE or other safety concern that is related to study drug treatment;   
c. Major or life-threatening bleeding (as defined in the protocol)  
d.  
e. Calculated CrCL decreased to < 30 mL/min confirmed by [CONTACT_34338], or need for dialysis

- 
7. Study terminated by [CONTACT_3211] (termination of all or part of the study by [CONTACT_103], in concert with the study leadership) 
 
Safety Monitor 
 
An independent Safety Monitor has been selected for this study.  The Safety Monitor 
is an expert in VTE and is distinct from the DMSB and Study Staff and will be 
available throughout the study to assess patient safety issues that may arise, 
objectively.  The Safety Monitor will have the ability to break the blind of a study 
patient as the need arises (immediately, in real-time).  If the Safety Monitor is 
unavailable because of travel, one of the Physician Study Investigators will serve as 
back-up.  The Safety Monitor will attend DSMB meetings, although will be non-voting.  
The Safety Monitor will have the ability to request an ad hoc DSMB meeting should a 
safety issue arise that warrants further review. 
Assessment and Reporting of Adverse Events 
 
Definitions 
 
Adverse events 
 
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any new untoward medical occurrence or 
worsening of a pre-existing medical condition in a patient or clinical investigation subject 
administered an investigational (medicinal) product and that does not necessarily have 
a causal relationship with this treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or 
disease temporally associated with the use of investigational product, whether or not 
considered related to the investigational product.  The causal relationship to study drug 
is determined by a physician and should be used to assess all AEs.

August 3, [ADDRESS_33638]. (In order to prevent reporting 
bias, subjects should not be questioned regarding the specific occurrence of one or 
more adverse events). 
 
through 30 days of discontinuation of dosing will be reported to BMS Worldwide Safety. 
 
Serious Adverse Events 
 
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence at any dose that: 
  
 results in death 
 is life-threatening (defined as an event in which the subject was at risk of 
death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which 
hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe)

 is a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
 is an important medical event, defined as a medical event that may not be 
immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_313], based 
on appropriate medical and scientific judgment, may jeopardize the subject 
or may require intervention (e.g., medical, surgical) to prevent one of the 
other serious outcomes listed above. Examples of such events include but 
are not limited to intensive treatment in an emergency department or at 
home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do 
not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. 
 
Suspected transmission of an infectious agent (e.g., pathogenic or non-pathogenic) via the 
study drug is an SAE.  Although pregnancy, overdose, and cancer are not always serious 
by [CONTACT_8661], these events must be handled as SAEs. 
 
 The following hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8609]:  
 A visit to the emergency room or other hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34235] 24 hours that does not result in admission (unless considered an

Adverse Events of Special Interest 
 
In this study, the following adverse events will to be reported to BMS, regardless of 
whether these reports are classified as serious or unexpected. 
 
 Potential or suspected cases of liver injury including but not limited to liver test 
abnormalities, jaundice, hepatitis or cholestasis. 
 
Pre-Existing Medical Conditions 
 
A pre-existing medical condition is one that is present at the start of the study.  Pre-
existing medical conditions should be recorded in the baseline and demographic data 
section of the electronic case report form (eCRF).  Pre-existing medical conditions 
should be reassessed during the trial and reported as an adverse event or severe 
adverse event only if the frequency, severity, or character of the conditions worsens 
significantly or unexpectedly during the study.  When reporting such adverse events, 
the description should convey that the pre-existing condition has changed by 
[CONTACT_9672] (e.g.
scheduled hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34236]-existing medical condition 
should not be considered adverse events. 
 
Serious Adverse Event Collecting and Reporting 
 
related or not related to study drug, must be collected, including those thought to be 
associated with protocol-specified procedures. All SAEs must be collected that occur 
during the screening period and within [ADDRESS_33639] 3, 2020 
33 
 The investigator should report any SAE occurring after these time periods that is 
believed to be related to study drug or protocol-specified procedure.  An SAE report 
should be completed for any event where doubt exists regarding its status of 
seriousness.  If the investigator believes that an SAE is not related to study drug, but 
is potentially related to the conditions of the study (such as withdrawal of previous 
therapy, or a complication of a study procedure), the relationship should be specified 
in the narrative section of the SAE Report Form. 
 
SAEs, whether related or unrelated to the study drug, and pregnancies must be 
reported to BMS within 1 business day of becoming aware of the event:  
 
SAE Email Address:  [EMAIL_176] 
SAE Fax Number:  [PHONE_188] 
 
SAEs must be recorded on the FDA MedWatch Form 3500A. Pregnancies must be 
reported on a Pregnancy Surveillance Form. 
 
If only limited information is initially available, follow-up reports are required. (Note: 
Follow-up SAE reports should include the same investigator term(s) initially reported.)  
 
If an ongoing SAE changes in its intensity or relationship to study drug or if new 
information becomes available, a follow-up SAE report should be sent within 24 hours 
to the BMS (or designee) using the same procedure used for transmitting the initial 
SAE report. All SAEs should be followed to resolution or stabilization. 
 
SAE Reconciliation 
 
 
The Sponsor will reconcile the clinical database AE cases ( case level only ) 
transmitted to BMS Global Pharmacovigilance (GPV&E) 
([EMAIL_555] ).  
 The Investigator will request from BMS GPV&E, 
[EMAIL_177]  the SAE reconciliation report and include the 
BMS protocol number every 3 months and prior to data base lock or final data 
summary 
 GPV&E will send the investigator the report to verify and confirm all SAEs 
have been transmitted to BMS GPV&E. 
 The data elements listed on the GPV&E reconciliation report will be used for 
case identification purposes. If the Investigator determines a case was not 
transmitted to BMS GPV&E, the case should be sent immediately to BMS 
([EMAIL_555] ). 
 
Health Authority Reporting (U.S. FDA IND) 
 
HI-PRO Trial    
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_3818], et al.  
August 3, [ADDRESS_33640] adhere to local Health Authority Reporting Requirements. For 
studies conducted under an investigator sponsored U.S. FDA IND, provide details of 
the following: 
 
 Any event that is both serious and unexpected must be reported to the 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as soon as possible and no later than 
7 days (for a death or life-threatening event) or 15 days (for all other SAEs) 
 
 BMS will be provided with a simultaneous copy of all adverse events filed 
with the FDA. SAEs should be reported on MedWatch Form 3500A, which 
can be accessed at: http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/medwatch/. 
 
MedWatch SAE forms should be sent to the FDA at:

Fax: [PHONE_188] 
Email: [EMAIL_178] 
 
Health Authority (HA), suspected serious adverse reactions (whether expected or 
unexpected) shall be reported by [CONTACT_34340] (either as expedited and/or in 
aggregate reports). 
 In accordance with local regulations, BMS will notify sponsor investigators of all 
reported SAEs that are suspected (related to the investigational product) and 
unexpected (ie, not previously described in the IB)). An 
event meeting these criteria is termed a Suspected, Unexpected Serious 
Adverse Reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R). Sponsor investigator notification of these events 
will be in the form of either a S[LOCATION_003]R Report or a Semi-Annual S[LOCATION_003]R Report.  
 Other important findings which may be reported by [CONTACT_34341] (ESR) include: increased frequency of a clinically significant 
expected SAE, an SAE considered associated with study procedures that 
could modify the conduct of the study, lack of efficacy that poses significant 
hazard to study subjects, clinically significant safety finding from a 
nonclinical (eg, animal) study, important safety recommendations from a 
HI-PRO Trial    
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_3818], et al.  
August 3, [ADDRESS_33642] review and retain 
the ESR with the IB. Where required by [CONTACT_34342] a 
central IRB/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) for the study, the sponsor 
will submit the ESR to the appropriate IRB/IEC. The investigator and 
IRB/IEC will determine if the informed consent requires revision. The 
investigator should also comply with the IRB/IEC procedures for reporting 
any other safety information.  
 
 
Non-Serious Adverse Events  
 
A non-serious adverse event (NSAE) is an AE not classified as serious. 
 
Non-Serious Event Collecting and Reporting 
 
 
The collection of non-
written consent to participate in the study. All non-serious adverse events (not only 
those deemed to be treatment-related) should be collected continuously during the 
treatment period and for a minimum of [ADDRESS_33643] dose of study 
treatment.  
Non-serious AEs should be followed to resolution or stabilization, or reported as 
SAEs if they become serious. Follow-up is also required for non-serious AEs that 
cause interruption or discontinuation of study drug and for those present at the end of 
study treatment as appropriate.  
Non-serious Adverse Events (AE) are to be provided to BMS in aggregate via interim 
or final study reports as specified in the agreement or, if a regulatory requirement [eg, 
IND US trial] as part of an annual reporting requirement.  
 
Laboratory Test Abnormalities 
 
All laboratory test results captured as part of the study should be recorded following 
institutional procedures. Test results that constitute SAEs should be documented and 
reported to BMS as such. 
 
The following laboratory abnormalities should be captured and reported as 
appropriate: 
 
 Any laboratory test result that is clinically significant or meets the definition of an SAE 
 Any laboratory test result abnormality that required the subject to have study 
drug discontinued or interrupted 
HI-PRO Trial    
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_3818], et al.  
August 3, [ADDRESS_33644] to receive 
specific corrective therapy.  
 
It is expected that wherever possible, the clinical rather than the laboratory term will 
be used by [CONTACT_9673] (e.g., use the term anemia rather than low 
hemoglobin value).  Laboratory test abnormalities are provided to BMS via annual 
safety reports (if applicable), and interim or final study reports. 
 
Pregnancy 
 
If, following initiation of api[INVESTIGATOR_3822], it is subsequently discovered that a study subject is 
pregnant or may have been pregnant at the time of api[INVESTIGATOR_9612], including 
during at least [ADDRESS_33645] 
immediately notify [EMAIL_179] of this event via the Pregnancy 
Surveillance Form within [ADDRESS_33646] be recorded in the appropriate section of the eCRF. Procedures to 
expedite reporting serious adverse events are described later in this section.   
 
 
Specific Adverse Event Reporting Guidelines 
 
Study investigators should follow the following guidelines to ensure the quality and 
precision of adverse event reporting: 
1. Use recognized medical terms 
2. Avoid the use of colloquialisms and non-standard abbreviations 
3. If known at the time of adverse event reporting, a diagnosis should be reported 
instead of individual symptoms and signs (e.g.
 
4. If the reported symptoms and signs cannot be medically characterized as a 
single diagnosis or syndrome at the time of adverse event reporting, the 
information that is available should be reported.  If a diagnosis is subsequently 
established, it should be reported as follow-up information as described earlier. 
5. A cascade of clinical events (such as sequelae of an adverse event) should be 
identified as the primary, causative event.  The cascade of events can be 
further described in the adverse event narrative.  For example, when recording 
a death, the event or condition that caused or contributed to the fatal outcome 
should be reported as the serious adverse event.  If the cause of death is 
 
6. Any adverse event that results in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9613] a 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9614] a serious adverse event.  If a subject is 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9615] a medical or surgical procedure as a result of an 
adverse event, the event responsible for the procedure (not the procedure 
itself) should be reported as the serious adverse event.  For example, if a 
subject is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9616] a result of a major 
bleeding event, record the major bleeding event that necessitated surgery as 
the serious adverse event. 
 
HI-PRO Trial    
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_3818], et al.  
August 3, [ADDRESS_33647] be classified according to intensity or severity, 
expectedness, relatedness, outcome, and treatment or action taken. 
 
Intensity or Severity 
 
The following categories for intensity or severity of an adverse event should be used 
in reporting: 
 
Mild  Awareness of a symptom or sign that does not interfere with the 
treatment and without sequelae 
Moderate 
still able to function 
Severe 
medication, surgery, or other intervention for treatment 
 
Expectedness 
 
Each adverse event should be evaluated as to whether it was expected or 
unexpected as follows: 
 
Expected The specificity and severity of the event is consistent with 
applicable information on api[INVESTIGATOR_3822]. 
Unexpected The specificity or severity of the event is not consistent with 
applicable information on api[INVESTIGATOR_3822].               
Unanticipated 
Adverse 
Device Effect 
(UADE) Any serious adverse effect on health or safety or any life-
threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with, 
api[INVESTIGATOR_3822], if that effect, problem, or death was not previously 
identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the 
investigational plan or application or any other unanticipated 
serious problem associated with api[INVESTIGATOR_34238], safety, or welfare of subjects.  
 
 
Relatedness 
 
Each adverse event should be evaluated as to whether it was related to the study 
procedures or api[INVESTIGATOR_9618]: 
 
Definite An adverse event is clearly related to api[INVESTIGATOR_34239]-PRO Trial

Possible An adverse event has a reasonable causal relationship to the 
use of api[INVESTIGATOR_3822]; an alternative etiology is equally or less likely  
Unlikely An adverse event has little or no causal relationship to the use 
of api[INVESTIGATOR_3822]; an alternative etiology is more likely 
Not related An adverse event is not related to the use of api[INVESTIGATOR_3822]; there is 
no temporal relationship or a much more likely alternative 
etiology exists 
 
causal relationship.  
 
Outcome 
 
The clinical course of all adverse events should be followed until a medical outcome 
is determined (resolution, stabilization, or determination that it was unrelated to study 
participation).  If a subject is pregnant or becomes pregnant within [ADDRESS_33648] to 
determine the outcome of the pregnancy (successful live-birth, etc.).  The clinical 
outcome of all adverse events should be recorded as follows: 
 
Death Patient expi[INVESTIGATOR_34240]: 
 
Intervention Surgery or other invasive procedure 
Non-surgical treatment Drug initiation, interruption, dose reduction, dose 
increase, or discontinuation 
None No action was taken 
 
Expedited Reporting of Serious Adverse Events (SAE) 
 
The study investigators must use the following procedure for reporting serious 
adverse events: 
1. Report any serious adverse event that occurs to the Sponsor within 24 hours 
of knowledge of the event (Monday through Friday).  If the investigator does 
HI-PRO Trial    
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_3818], et al.  
August 3, [ADDRESS_33649] all information regarding the SAE, he/she will not wait to receive 
additional information before notifying the Sponsor  of the event and 
completing the eCRF.  The investigator shall provide an event update when 
additional information is received. 
 
NOTE:  The Sponsor will automatically be notified when an adverse event or 
serious adverse event has been entered into the database when the 
investigator fills in an eCRF.  
 
2. In the reporting of serious adverse events, the study investigator shall provide 
any potentially relevant information including: 
a. Subject demographics 
b. Pre-existing conditions 
c. The complete description of the adverse event. 
d. Date and time of adverse event onset 
e. Severity 
f. Treatment 
g. Results of diagnostic testing 
h. Duration of sequelae 
i. Outcome (if known) 
j. Date and time of adverse event resolution. 
k. Information on suspected medications including dose, route of 
administration, frequency, dates, lot number, expi[INVESTIGATOR_320], and 
concomitant medications 
 
3. When reporting a death, the primary event or condition that caused or contributed 
to the fatal outcome shall be reported as the serious adverse event.  Death will be 
reported as the outcomes of the serious adverse event.  If the cause of death is 
unknown a  
 
4. The investigator shall report unanticipated adverse device effects (UADEs) to 
the sponsor and Institutional Review Board within [ADDRESS_33650] learns of the event.   
 
Sponsor Unanticipated Adverse Drug Effects (UADEs) Reporting Responsibilities 
 
Any serious adverse event determined to be caused by [CONTACT_9674][INVESTIGATOR_34241] U.S. Food and Drug Administration and IRBs.  Upon notice 
of an unanticipated adverse drug effect (UADE), the sponsor shall immediately 
conduct an evaluation of the UADE and report the results of the evaluation to the 
FDA, all reviewing IRBs, and participating investigators within [ADDRESS_33651] data will be collected using a web-based electronic case report form (eCRF) 
called REDCap.  Database monitoring and quality control will be performed by [CONTACT_34343] (DSMB). 
Monitoring Plan 
 
Monitoring procedures will consist of the following: 
 
During the study, the study staff shall perform monthly random reviews of data with 
checks for accuracy and completeness, and document that corrective actions have 
been taken in response to protocol deviations or other forms of non-compliance.  
These reports will be provided to the Data Safety Monitoring Board. 
 
Data Safety Monitoring Board  
 
Three independent individuals with relevant expertise in VTE and anticoagulation will 
be appointed to a data safety monitoring board (DSMB) whose primary responsibility 
is to protect the safety of study subjects and to provide ongoing, critical, and 
unbiased evaluation of the progress of the study. The DSMB will be comprised of two 
independent physicians and an independent statistician.  To further ensure 
idependence of the DSMB, the DSMB Chair has been selected and is an expert in 
VTE AND comes from outside the Mass General Brigham Network. 
 
The DSMB will: 
 Provide independent safety evaluation of events and adjudicate all actual and 
potential serious adverse events experienced by [CONTACT_34344], particularly death, symptomatic VTE and major bleeding; and 
can recommend premature stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_34242]. 
 
The DSMB will meet virtually via Zoom under the restrictions imposed by [CONTACT_25963]-
[ADDRESS_33652] once every three months for the duration of the trial in addition to prespecified 
meetings at 10 months and 50% of enrollment (Table).   In addition, the DSMB may 
be convened on an ad hoc basis at the request of the study investigators if the need 
(for example, due to a study-related concern) arises in between regularly scheduled 
meetings.  The DSMB chair may call an emergency meeting at any time should 
questions of patient safety arise or at the request of the Study Safety Monitor.  The 
exact dates and times of the DSMB meetings will be determined based on the 
availability of all three members to meet  and will take place within the first two weeks 
of the given month. 
HI-PRO Trial    
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_3818], et al.  
August 3, [ADDRESS_33653] point through the enrollment period 
(10 months).  At this point the DSMB will assess whether the study is on-track 
to meet its enrollment goal.  The DSMB will also assess any safety concerns at 
that time.  Once the review is complete and no safety or enrollment concerns 
are raised, the trial will continue. 
5. A DSMB meeting will also occur when 50% of the planned enrollment population 
has completed 12-month follow-up as part of the prespecified interim analysis.  
This planned interim analysis will inform the DSMB on whether the study should 
be stopped early due to efficacy, safety concerns, or futility or continue to enroll 
the full 600-patient cohort. 
6. A final DSMB meeting will take place after follow-up completion of the last 
subject. The DSMB will review all remaining safety data collected on the 
subjects enrolled. 
7. The DSMB chair may call an emergency meeting at any time should questions 
of patient safety arise or at the request of the independent Study Safety Monitor.  
All materials, discussions, and proceedings of the DSMB are completely 
confidential. The Chair and other participants present at DSMB meetings are 
expected to maintain confidentiality.

Blinding/Unblinding 
 
This study will be conducted in a blinded fashion. To maintain blinding of study 
treatment, study medications will be prepared using placebo matching the active 
treatments.  Subjects, Investigators, members of any of the administrative and 
adjudicating 
access to individual subject treatment assignments.  
 
Blinding is critical to the integrity of this clinical study. However, in the event of a 
medical emergency or pregnancy in an individual subject, in which knowledge of the 
investigational product is critical to the subject's management, the blind for that 
HI-PRO Trial    
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_3818], et al.  
August 3, [ADDRESS_33663] may be broken by [CONTACT_34346] (or if unavailable, the treating 
investigator). Before breaking the blind of an individual subject's treatment, the Safety 
Monitor should have determined that the information is necessary, i.e., that it will alter 
the subject's immediate management. In many cases, particularly when the 
emergency is clearly not investigational product-related, the problem may be properly 
managed by [CONTACT_34347]. 
 
The Safety Monitor should ensure that health care professionals who may provide 
any elective, urgent or emergent medical or surgical care for a subject after 
randomization are informed that: 
1. The subject is enrolled in a clinical study and is receiving blinded oral study 
treatment, consisting of: 
a.  Factor Xa inhibitor, OR 
b.  Placebo 
2. The factor Xa inhibitor is an anticoagulant, with a half-life of approximately [ADDRESS_33664]:

to surgery and invasive procedures, as well as the management of bleeding that may 
occur in subjects on study drugs. These are: 
 The risk of thromboembolism in an individual subject (low, intermediate or 
high). 
  The risk of bleeding associated with the procedure or surgery. 
 Whether the surgery or invasive procedure is elective or emergent in 
nature. 
 The desirability of maintaining blinding, if at all possible, without creating 
risk for the subject. 
 The times of onset and offset of anticoagulant effect for api[INVESTIGATOR_34244], local standards of care for discontinuation of anticoagulation prior to 
elective procedures/surgery should be employed; these may be informed by [CONTACT_34350]. 
 
These are summarized below: 
 Stop api[INVESTIGATOR_3822]/api[INVESTIGATOR_3822]-placebo 2-4 days before the planned procedure. 
 If the procedure is associated with an increased risk of thrombosis, brief 
postoperative protection with UFH or LMWH may be considered. 
 Restart api[INVESTIGATOR_3822]/api[INVESTIGATOR_3822]-placebo postoperatively (usually the day after 
surgery) when it is deemed safe to do so. If UFH/LMWH is used in the 
postoperative period, it is recommended that api[INVESTIGATOR_3822]/api[INVESTIGATOR_3822]-placebo 
begin: 
  [ADDRESS_33666] dose of UFH; 
  [ADDRESS_33667] dose of LMWH indicated for twice daily 
administration; or 
  [ADDRESS_33668] dose of LMWH indicated for once daily 
administration (or fondaparinux). 
 
Emergency Procedures 
 
For urgent or emergent invasive procedures, when waiting 4 - 5 days is not an option, 
management will in part depend on the randomized treatment assignment (placebo 
or api[INVESTIGATOR_3822]) and unblinding may be necessary (see Section on Blinding/Unblinding). 
Regardless of treatment, study drugs should be discontinued and standard laboratory 
coagulation tests (PT/INR, aPTT, platelet count, etc.) performed. The procedure 
should be carried out and in such a way to minimize the risk of bleeding. For subjects 
receiving api[INVESTIGATOR_3822], the risk of bleeding with invasive procedures is unknown. At 
therapeutic doses, the anticoagulant effects of api[INVESTIGATOR_34245]. Given its half-life (12 hours), however, the anticoagulant 
effect of api[INVESTIGATOR_34246] [ADDRESS_33669] dose may be treated with prothrombin 
complex concentrate or andexanet alfa.  If treatment with an alternative open label 
anticoagulant/antithrombotic is indicated for the procedure, it should be used at the 
lowest therapeutic dose (if at all) in the [ADDRESS_33670] dose of api[INVESTIGATOR_3822].  
 
Treatment Guidelines for Bleeding/Suspected Bleeding 
 
Subjects with bleeding or suspected bleeding will undergo confirmatory laboratory or 
other testing (e.g., US, CT, MRI) and a (S)AE CRF must be completed. The date and 
time of the onset of the bleeding event will be recorded on the CRF. 
 
For subjects with minor bleeding, study drug may or may not be held at the discretion 
of the local physician and investigator. A risk/benefit determination should be made 
 
thromboembolism and benefit from continued anticoagulation. Minor bleeding should 
otherwise be managed according to local standard of care. 
 
For subjects with clinically significant bleeding, the study drugs should generally be 
held. Bleeding should be managed according to local standard of care and may 
include measures such as: 
 
 Local measures to stop the bleeding 
 Volume resuscitation, and transfusion of blood products as appropriate 
 Standard laboratory tests (e.g., hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelet count, 
etc.) 
 
Note: Neither api[INVESTIGATOR_34247]. 
 
The management of clinically significant bleeding will in part depend on the 
randomized treatment assignment (placebo or api[INVESTIGATOR_3822]) so unblinding may be 
necessary (see Section on Blinding/Unblinding). Should unblinding occur, subjects 
receiving placebo should be managed according to the local standard of care. 
Given its half-life (12 - 15 hours), however, the anticoagulant effect of api[INVESTIGATOR_34248] 24 - 48 hours. Subjects receiving api[INVESTIGATOR_34249] (PCC) or andexanet alfa as per Good Clinical Practice and local 
anticoagulant reversal protocols. 
 
Management of Recurrent Venous Thromboembolic Events 
 
If a subject has a confirmed recurrent symptomatic VTE (DVT or PE), as deemed by 
[CONTACT_34351], then the patient must discontinue study treatment and 
transition to the appropriate standard of care. The subject should remain in the study 
and should be followed in the same manner as a subject who has discontinued study 
treatment as described in the protocol.

 Prohibited and/or Restricted Treatments 
 
Prohibited Treatments: 
 
The following medications or therapi[INVESTIGATOR_34250]: 
 Potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., azole antifungals [itraconazole and 
ketoconazole], macrolide antibiotics [clarithromycin and telithromycin], 
protease inhibitors [ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, atazanavir, and saquinavir], 
and nefazadone) 
 Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] > 81 mg/day 
 Dual antiplatelet therapy such as concomitant (simultaneous) use of both 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_34251] a thienopyridine (e.g., clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745], ticlopi[INVESTIGATOR_5325]) 
 Other antithrombotic agents (e.g., UFH, LMWH, direct thrombin inhibitors, 
fondaparinux)  
 GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors (e.g., abciximab, eptifibatide, tirofiban) 
 
If treatment with a prohibited agent becomes necessary, study drug should be 
temporarily interrupted, and restarted as soon as possible following discontinuation of 
the prohibited medication or therapy. 
 
Restricted Treatments: 
 
The administration of the following agents in subjects on study drug should be done 
cautiously given the increased risk of bleeding. In such cases, consideration of 
interruption of the study drug may be warranted; this decision should be made after a 
careful assessment of the risks and potential benefits. 
 
Examples: 
 Chronic (> 3 months) daily NSAIDs. NSAIDs should not be administered in 
doses that exceed those in the approved label 
 Cytotoxic/myelosuppressive therapy

to all parties of the study. 
C. Patient enrollment may be paused or terminated early if the DSMB 
determines that the potential benefits of continuing the trial are unlikely to 
outweigh the risks.  For example, if the probability of achieving the target 
primary endpoints falls below a certain threshold, the trial will be stopped or 
paused for re-evaluation.

Statistical Methods 
 
Sample Size Calculation 
 
This study is a 600-patient single-center, randomized controlled trial utilizing an 
enriched population.  Based on the contemporary (within the last 10 years) large 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_34260] (2,3,7) and a large meta-analysis of 
low-dose aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] (31) for prevention of recurrent events in patients with initial 
unprovoked VTE or clinically suspected to have a high risk of recurrence, we 
conservatively estimate an average 12-month VTE recurrence rate in patients not 
treated with extended-duration anticoagulation (placebo group) of 6% (Table 2).

In EINSTEIN CHOICE which randomized 60% of patients with provoked VTE, the 
control group received low-dose aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] (which based on a meta-analysis in 
unprovoked VTE patients confers about a 33% relative risk reduction) had a 
recurrence rate of 3.6% (2,31).  Accordingly, we would expect the 12-month VTE 
recurrence rate to be at least 33% higher in patients assigned to placebo in the 
proposed study and therefore approximately 5-6%.  The recurrent VTE rate among 
placebo patients in the AMPLIFY-EXT trial of api[INVESTIGATOR_34261] a bit higher at 8.8% 
(7).  By [CONTACT_34352] (persistent immobility, obesity, heart failure, chronic lung disease, chronic 
kidney disease, inflammatory disorder, or atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease), we 
2-fold (all of these persistent provoking risk factors increase the risk of VTE by 2-4-
fold; Table 3) (32).  Many patients enrolled in the study will have multiple persistent 
provoking VTE risk factors (for example, heart failure, obesity, and atherosclerotic 
cardiovascular disease) and thereby [CONTACT_34353].   In an 
effort to be ultra-conservative, we kept the multiplier for this enriched study population 
to 2-fold (while in reality for many study patients it could be 4-fold or even higher).  
Accordingly, our estimate of a 12-month VTE recurrence rate of 6% is very 
conservative and still below the VTE recurrence rates reported in EINSTEIN VTE 
Continued Treatment and AMPLIFY EXT (neither of which included an enriched 
population).

Based on the data from EINSTEIN CHOICE, we conservatively estimate that low-
intensity api[INVESTIGATOR_3822] (2.5 mg twice daily) compared with placebo will provide a similar 
HI-PRO Trial    
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_3818], et al.  
August 3, 2020 
51 
 reduction (75%) in recurrent VTE as low-intensity rivaroxaban (10 mg daily) 
compared with low-dose aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] (2).  The 75% relative risk reduction was reported 
specifically for recurrent VTE and in the provoked VTE patient population, comparing 
rivaroxaban [ADDRESS_33673] randomized controlled trial analysis.  If anything, the 
reduction in the proposed study should be even greater since we propose a placebo-
control instead of active (aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248]) control and we will be following our patients for 12 
months, instead of allowing shorter follow-up as was reported in EINSTEIN CHOICE.  
Accordingly, assuming an estimated incidence in the placebo group of 6% at 12 
months and a decrease in the primary outcome of 75% with api[INVESTIGATOR_3822] 2.[ADDRESS_33674] 80% power to show the superiority of 
low-intensity api[INVESTIGATOR_34262], at a two-sided alpha level of 0.05.  To account 
for patients who may be lost to follow-up or withdraw from the study, we will recruit 
[ADDRESS_33675] 3 months of anticoagulant 
therapy in accordance with current and widely-accepted evidence-based clinical 
practice guidelines (Eur Heart J. 2020; 41: [ADDRESS_33676]. 2016;149:315-352, and 
Circulation. 2011;123:1788 1830).  Data from the PADIS-PE study showed that the 
rate of VTE recurrence is higher closer in temporal proximity to the initial event, such 
that the recurrence rate is higher at 3-6 months after diagnosis than it is at 6-12 
months (Couturaud F, et al. Six Months vs Extended Oral Anticoagulation After a 
First Epi[INVESTIGATOR_34263]. JAMA. 2015;314(1):31-40).  Accordingly, the 
anticipated event rate should be higher in our study than EINSTEIN-CHOICE and the 
resultant observed relative risk reduction is likely to be higher. 
 
Sensitivity analyses performed for the comparison between api[INVESTIGATOR_3822] 2.5 mg twice 
daily and placebo (Tables 4 - 6) show that our sample size is most sensitive to 
change in the impact of the extended duration anticoagulation.  However, we have 
been very conservative in our effect size calculation and baseline recurrent VTE rate 
(for example, we have not taken into account the increase in event rates of an 
enriched population with persistent immobility, obesity, heart failure, chronic lung 
disease, chronic kidney disease, inflammatory disorder, or atherosclerotic 
cardiovascular disease), as above.

The sample size calculation for the trial was calculated based upon 12-month rates of 
recurrent VTE from pi[INVESTIGATOR_34264] (2,3,7,33) and a large meta-
analysis of low-dose aspi[INVESTIGATOR_34265]. placebo (31).  Accordingly, assuming an estimated 
incidence in the placebo group of 6% at 12 months and a decrease in the primary 
outcome of 75% with api[INVESTIGATOR_3822] 2.[ADDRESS_33677] 
80% power to show the superiority of low-intensity api[INVESTIGATOR_34262], at a two-
sided alpha level of 0.05.  If the trial utilized 6-month follow-up instead of 12-month, 
we would observe fewer recurrent VTE events and would require an increase in the 
sample size, which would require a longer enrollment period and would incur greater 
cost.  As such, we have determined 12-month follow-up to facilitate the most efficient 
and cost-effective trial. 
 
We have conducted a retrospective analysis using an ongoing BWH registry of 405 
patients with pulmonary embolism/deep vein thrombosis.  We identified [ADDRESS_33678] one provoking risk factor.  Among those who 
received 3-6 months of anticoagulation, 11.1% developed symptomatic recurrent 
venous thromboembolism in the ensuing year after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_34266].  If we 
utilize this baseline rate of recurrent VTE in our sample size calculation, we will 
require 212 patients in each study group, assuming a 75% relative risk reduction with 
api[INVESTIGATOR_3822] 2.5 mg twice daily compared with placebo and 90% power to show the 
superiority of low-intensity api[INVESTIGATOR_34262], at a two-sided alpha level of 0.05.   
 
We have also consulted with an independent biostatistician from the Harvard Catalyst 
Biostatistics Program (Shelley Hurwitz, PhD) to review our sample size requirement.  
She confirmed our sample size calculation using a recurrent VTE rate in the placebo

It was also suggested that we consider using the lower limit of the 95% confidence 
interval around our estimate of 11.1%, which would be 8.2%.  The statistician 
suggested that this would also provide a conservative estimate of the frequency of 
recurrent VTE for the sample size calculation (see Table 8 below).

 Using this more conservative sample size calculation, we would aim to enroll 300 
patients in each arm for a total trial population of 600. 
 
 
Statistical Analysis Plan 
 
For this study, we will calculate: 
1) the 12-month frequency of major and clinically relevant non-major bleeding 
2) the 12-month frequency of symptomatic recurrent VTE 
 
The primary efficacy objective of this trial is to determine whether api[INVESTIGATOR_3822] 2.5 mg 
twice daily is superior to placebo for the primary endpoint of symptomatic, 
recurrent VTE after 12 months of extended therapy.  The analysis will include 
descriptive statistics of event rates and 95% CI, and risk difference and 95% CI. The 
Mantel-Haenszel statistic will be used to test this hypothesis formally.  Superiority 
over placebo will be claimed for a dose if the Hochberg adjusted p-
and the RR is < 1.  The analysis will be supported by [CONTACT_5263]-Meier curves.  The 
primary efficacy outcome analysis will be intention-to-treat.  We will also perform an 
on-treatment analysis. 
 
The primary safety objective will be to determine whether api[INVESTIGATOR_3822] 2.5 mg twice daily 
results in a statistically significant difference in major bleeding at 12 months (during 
the treatment period) compared with placebo. Analysis of incidence of these 
endpoints will be based on the safety analysis set. The analysis will include 
descriptive statistics of event rates and 95% CI, and risk difference and 95% CI. 
Hypotheses will be tested using Mantel-Haenszel statistic.  The analysis will be 
supported by [CONTACT_5263]-Meier curves of the time to first adjudicated major bleeding 
event.  All bleeding analyses will be conducted on the safety dataset. 
 
Baseline characteristics will be summarized by [CONTACT_19313]. Any imbalances between the 
treatment groups for any demographic or baseline characteristic will be assessed based 
on clinical relevance in reviewing the summaries. For any differences deemed clinically 
relevant to the efficacy comparisons, exploratory analyses that include the imbalanced 
factor as a categorized covariate will be performed. 
 
To account for the effect of baseline low-dose aspi[INVESTIGATOR_34267], we will perform a pre-specified 
stratified efficacy analysis of patients receiving low-dose api[INVESTIGATOR_34268]-
dose aspi[INVESTIGATOR_34269]-dose api[INVESTIGATOR_34201].  We 
will calculate stratum-
unadjusted) and stratum-specific risk ratios will enable us to determine whether aspi[INVESTIGATOR_34270]-dose api[INVESTIGATOR_34271].  If the stratum-specific risk 
ratio is similar to the crude risk ratio, then there is minimal impact of low-dose aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248]. 
However, if the stratum-specific risk ratio differs from the unadjusted estimate by 10% or 
more, then low-dose aspi[INVESTIGATOR_34272]-dose api[INVESTIGATOR_3822].  We will conduct a 
similar analysis for the safety outcome of major bleeding.

 We will also pre-specify subgroup analyses focused on the safety and efficacy of major 
 65 years), women, and those 
with persistent provoking factors of immobility, obesity, heart failure, chronic lung 
disease, chronic kidney disease, hemodialysis, chronic inflammatory/autoimmune 
disorder, and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. 
 
Means, medians, and frequency distributions will be calculated for continuous 
variables.  Number and percentages will be reported for binary and categorical 
variables.  Differences between subgroups of interest will be examined using the chi-
square or Fish -test or 
Wilcoxon Rank Sum for continuous variables (if the subgroups are of sufficient size 
for statistical comparison).   
 
Safety outcome analyses will be performed among patients who received one or 
more doses of a study drug (Safety Population).  All p-values reported will be two-
sided. A p-value < 0.[ADDRESS_33684] a pre-specified interim analysis to assess the primary safety and 
efficacy outcomes after 50% of the planned enrollment population has completed 12-

Board on whether the study should be stopped early due to efficacy, safety concerns, 
or futility or continue to enroll the full 600-patient cohort.

The Thrombosis Research Group has an infrastructure of experienced leadership, 
with trained personnel in a multidisciplinary academic team (research pharmacists, 
cardiology fellows, research nurses, research coordinators, biostatisticians, 
administrators, and medical informatics specialists).  Data storage and computing 
resources, as well as a network of regional, national, and international collaborating 
investigators, facilitate our execution of ongoing research projects and our planning of 
future research projects.  The Thrombosis Research Group has studied all aspects of 
VTE, including epi[INVESTIGATOR_623], diagnosis, treatment, and prevention.  According to 
www.pubmed.gov, the group has authored more than [ADDRESS_33688] extensive experience leading randomized controlled 
trials focused on prevention and treatment of thromboembolic disease.  Examples of 
major Thrombosis Research Group-lead trials in this area include the 2500-patient 
multicenter Electronic Alert Trial (40), the 2500-patient multicenter Physician Alert 
Trial (41), the 2500-patient Discharge Alert Trial (42), and the 85-patient multicenter 
eTRIS trial (35).   
 
Vascular Medicine at BWH is a regional Center of Excellence for VTE care.  An EPIC 
Electronic Health Record query of the outpatient clinic volume of the five Vascular 
Medicine faculty providers and the [ADDRESS_33689] 3, 2020

 demonstrated a provoked VTE volume of approximately 1500 new and follow-up 
patients.

Pi[INVESTIGATOR_3818] [ADDRESS_33690]. Lee, we 
calculate 1600 new and follow-up provoked VTE patients who present for outpatient 
visits at BWH per year and we conservatively estimate that 25% will fail to meet all 
the inclusion criteria or will meet at least one exclusion criterion.  Therefore, an

 Based on our prior clinical trial experience at the BWH Thrombosis Research Group, 
we conservatively estimate that 50% of the patients who are screened and found to 
be eligible for the trial will consent to participate.  Therefore, an estimated [ADDRESS_33692] an adequate reserve in staffing and 
flexibility to augment our effort should enrollment require it. 
 
 
TRG led the patient recruitment effort for the Cardiovascular Inflammation Reduction 
Trial (CIRT), a randomized, double-blind trial of low-dose methotrexate in 4786 
patients with previous myocardial infarction or multivessel coronary disease who 
additionally had either type 2 diabetes or the metabolic syndrome (39).  CIRT was a 
landmark study which involved a novel application of a challenging anti-inflammatory 
drug, serial laboratory evaluations, and a high number of follow-up phone calls and 
in-person office visits, which required patients to travel from as far as [LOCATION_004] to 
[LOCATION_011].  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_34280], TRG made BWH the overall top enrolling site in 
the CIRT trial. 
 
We anticipate rapid enrollment in the HI-PRO trial.  First, all the patients in the study 
will be familiar with anticoagulation and many will have received api[INVESTIGATOR_3822].  Second, 
there are no study-mandated laboratory tests or office visits.  Third, many patients 
with provoked VTE are reluctant to discontinue anticoagulation after the acute 
treatment phase because of the fear of recurrent events.  We anticipate that many 
patients with provoked VTE will be highly interested in participating in a clinical trial of 
extended secondary prevention thromboprophylaxis, especially with the favorable 
safety and efficacy profile of low-intensity api[INVESTIGATOR_3822].  It is quite possible that greater 
than 50% of eligible patients will want to participate and provide informed consent.  In 
such a scenario, we would expect to enroll more quickly.

Protection of Subjects against the Risks of Research Procedures 
 
Before Study Enrollment 
 
A rigorous screening process will be utilized to ensure that subjects with an increased 
risk of harm due to enrollment in the study are excluded from the study.  This will 
include performing a detailed history and physical examination (to ensure that enrolled 
subjects truly fulfill all eligibility criteria) and carefully reviewing the results of laboratory 
testing (in particular, hematocrit, platelet count, INR, and serum creatinine).   
 
During Follow-Up 
 
Changes in health status during the 12-month follow-up period will be evaluated by 
, and other routine providers.  All subjects enrolled will 
also have ongoing medical care with a dedicated Vascular Medicine provider.   As 
api[INVESTIGATOR_9636]-approved drug commonly used for thromboprophylaxis and does 
not require routine follow-up clinical or laboratory monitoring for toxicity, the study will 
not mandate any follow-up visits or procedures other than those required for the

Use of Information and Publication 
 
All information concerning and relating to the study is considered confidential 
information.  This information includes the clinical investigational plan, case report 
forms (CRFs), training materials, and scientific data.   
 
Ethical Considerations 
 
In this prospective, single-center randomized placebo-controlled study, we will be 
evaluating the impact of api[INVESTIGATOR_34285].  The benefits of api[INVESTIGATOR_34286].  The risk of bleeding in provoked VTE patients receiving api[INVESTIGATOR_34287].   
 
Because the proposed clinical trial involves a novel application of a U.S. FDA-
approved anticoagulant, we will obtain written consent from all study subjects and 
Institutional Review Board approval at the study site.

Protocol Summary 
 
Title: Randomized Controlled Trial of Extended-Duration Low-Dose Api[INVESTIGATOR_34198]-Risk Patients with Provoked Venous Thromboembolism 
(HI-PRO Trial) 
  
Design: U.S.-based, single-center, randomized placebo-controlled trial. 
 
Brief Treatment Description:  Low-dose api[INVESTIGATOR_3822] (2.5mg twice daily) for extended-
duration secondary prevention of VTE after initial treatment for provoked VTE. 
  
Purpose: To establish the safety and efficacy of low-dose api[INVESTIGATOR_34199].  
  
Population:  Outpatients with provoked VTE with at least one persistent provoking 
factor. 
  
Enrollment: 600 subjects  
 
Randomization:  1:1 
  
Clinical Site Locations:  1 center (    
  
Study Duration: 36 months; enrollment period of up to 20 months with 12-month 
follow-up. 
  
Primary Safety and Efficacy Outcomes:   
 
Primary Safety Outcome:  International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis 
(ISTH) major bleeding at 12 months. 
 
Primary Efficacy Outcome:  Symptomatic, recurrent VTE, defined as the composite 
of deep vein thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism at 12 months.  
 
Secondary Safety Outcome:   ISTH clinically relevant non-major bleeding at 12 
months. 
 
Secondary Efficacy Outcome: The composite of death due to cardiovascular 
cause, nonfatal myocardial infarction, stroke or systemic embolism, critical limb 
ischemia, or coronary or peripheral ischemia requiring revascularization (major 
adverse cardiovascular events, including major adverse limb events) at 12 months.

 Specific Aims
 
Provoked VTE is traditionally considered a transient acute disorder requiring a limited 
duration of anticoagulant therapy.  Patients who suffer deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or 
pulmonary embolism (PE) following major surgery, major trauma, or periods of 
immobility are generally treated with time-limited anticoagulation for [ADDRESS_33729] recently been recognized as a heterogeneous 
population comprised of those with transient provoking and persistent provoking risk

 Introduction and Background
 
Provoked venous thromboembolism (VTE) is traditionally considered a transient 
acute disorder requiring a limited duration of anticoagulant therapy.  Patients who 
suffer deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) following major 
surgery, major trauma, or periods of immobility are generally treated with time-limited 
anticoagulation for [ADDRESS_33737] recently been 
recognized as a heterogeneous population comprised of those with transient 
provoking and persistent provoking risk factors (1).  Common risk factors in provoked 
VTE such as obesity, immobility, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, heart failure, 
chronic lung disease, chronic kidney disease, and inflammatory disorders frequently 
contribute to an enduring rather than transient risk.  Furthermore, epi[INVESTIGATOR_34207] (8,9) and the randomized clinical trial EINSTEIN CHOICE (3) suggest that 
VTE is best characterized as a chronic disorder with periodic relapses.  A landmark 
Danish National Registry analysis demonstrated that patients who suffer provoked or 
unprovoked VTE have an increased risk of recurrence over the ensuing 30 years and 
that recurrent PE causes increased mortality (10).  While the rate of VTE recurrence 
ranges 30-50% over 10 years for unprovoked VTE (also termed idiopathic; 
unprovoked implies that an immediate trigger for the VTE cannot be identified), 
recurrent events occur in about 20% of patients over 10 years after a provoked event 
(provoked VTE is defined as post-operative, post-major trauma, post-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], 
or related to pregnancy, hormonal contraception/replacement therapy, or immobility) 
(1113).  Based on these data, provoked VTE patients represent a population 
vulnerable to VTE recurrence, especially at the transition of care from the initial 
(acute) treatment phase to the chronic treatment phase, at which point 
anticoagulation is discontinued in most of these patients.   
 
The EINSTEIN CHOICE trial recently evaluated the safety and efficacy of regimens 
of full- or lower-intensity anticoagulant therapy versus low-dose aspi[INVESTIGATOR_34208] (2).  The EINSTEIN 
CHOICE Investigators randomly assigned 3396 patients with VTE to receive either 
once-daily rivaroxaban (at doses of 20 mg or 10 mg) or 100 mg of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248].  Prior to 
enrollment in EINSTEIN CHOICE, all study patients completed 6 to 12 months of 
anticoagulation therapy, and their providers were in equipoise regarding the need for 
extended anticoagulation.  Approximately 60% of patients in EINSTEIN CHOICE had 
suffered provoked VTE.  Symptomatic recurrent VTE occurred in 17 of 1107 patients 
(1.5%) receiving 20 mg of rivaroxaban and in 13 of 1127 patients (1.2%) receiving 10 
mg of rivaroxaban, and in 50 of 1131 patients (4.4%) receiving low-dose aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] 
(hazard ratio for 20 mg of rivaroxaban vs. aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], 0.34; 95% confidence interval [CI], 
0.20 to 0.59; hazard ratio for 10 mg of rivaroxaban vs. aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], 0.26; 95% CI, 0.14 to 
0.47; P<0.001 for both comparisons).  Rates of major bleeding were similar (0.5% in 
the group receiving 20 mg of rivaroxaban, 0.4% in the group receiving 10 mg of 
rivaroxaban, and 0.3% in the low-dose aspi[INVESTIGATOR_34209]) (2).   
 
Data from 4,[ADDRESS_33738] a reduction in recurrence with extended duration anticoagulation 
compared with low-dose aspi[INVESTIGATOR_34203] (1.5% vs. 4.9%) (2,3).  Common 
persistent provoking factors included immobility, obesity, heart failure, and chronic 
 and rheumatoid arthritis.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_34210], persistent provoking factors are rarely considered when 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_34211] 3- to 6-month duration of therapy.  The [ADDRESS_33739] 
Physicians (ACCP) Guidelines on Antithrombotic Therapy for VTE do not distinguish 
between transient and persistent provoking risk factors and recommend limited-
duration anticoagulation for provoked events (4). 
 
However, an emerging opi[INVESTIGATOR_34205] (5).  Such a strategy breaks from the tradition of dichotomizing VTE 
as provoked or unprovoked.  Rather, persisting risk factors such as heart failure, 
obesity, family history of VTE, acquired or hereditary thrombophilia, and 
immobilization are incorporated into the decision-making process for pathways 
focused on secondary prevention. 
 
A suitable long-term strategy for secondary prevention has been recommended in 
evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for patients with unprovoked VTE (4).  
Extended-duration anticoagulation with warfarin or the direct oral anticoagulants 
(DOACs) is validated and recommended for prevention of recurrent unprovoked VTE 
in patients with a low-risk of bleeding (6).  However, current evidence-based clinical 
practice guidelines are inadequate for secondary prevention in patients with provoked 
VTE based on several extended-duration anticoagulation trials that included patients 
with provoked and unprovoked VTE.  In a randomized controlled trial of rivaroxaban 
for extended-duration secondary prevention in patients with either provoked (26%) or 
unprovoked (74%) DVT, recurrent VTE occurred in 8 patients (1.3%) in the 
rivaroxaban group compared with 42 patients (7.1%) in the placebo group (hazard 
ratio, 0.18; 95% CI, 0.09 to 0.39; P<0.001, relative risk reduction, 82%) (3).   
 
In a landmark extension trial of patients with unprovoked VTE, the AMPLIFY-EXT trial 
compared two doses of api[INVESTIGATOR_3822] (2.5 mg and 5 mg, twice daily) with placebo in 2486 
patients with VTE who had completed 6 to 12 months of anticoagulation therapy and 
for whom there was clinical equipoise regarding the need for extended-duration 
anticoagulant therapy for secondary prevention (7).  Symptomatic recurrent VTE or 
death from VTE occurred in 73 of the 829 patients (8.8%) who were receiving 
placebo versus 14 of the 840 patients (1.7%) who were receiving 2.5 mg of api[INVESTIGATOR_34206] 14 of the 813 patients (1.7%) who were receiving 5 mg of api[INVESTIGATOR_3822] (p<0.001 for 
both comparisons). In Kaplan-Meier analysis, the api[INVESTIGATOR_3822] 2.5 mg twice daily 
regimen demonstrated a major and clinically-relevant nonmajor bleeding rate similar 
to that of placebo.  While approximately 9% of the patients in the AMPLIFY-EXT trial 
had transient or reversible risk factors for VTE, the provoked VTE population only 
accounted for approximately 200 patients and precluded a well-powered analysis.  
Furthermore, the intent of the AMPLIFY-EXT trial was to study unprovoked VTE (7).  
HI-PRO Trial    
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_3818], et al.  
November 19, [ADDRESS_33740] of VTE secondary 
prevention.  Rather than using the simple dichotomized view of VTE as provoked or 
unprovoked, HI-PRO is focusing on how the risk of recurrence in patients with 
persisting provoking factors may be modulated by [CONTACT_6398]-dose api[INVESTIGATOR_3822].  The 
foundation of this question is based on the current direction in which the field of VTE 
is moving (5) and supported by [CONTACT_34319]-sound ISTH 
classification of risk factors (1). 
 
Api[INVESTIGATOR_3822] 2.[ADDRESS_33741] additional advantages for extended-duration 
secondary prevention of VTE compared with rivaroxaban 10 mg daily (which has U.S. 
FDA approval for extended-duration therapy).  Api[INVESTIGATOR_34212] a more 
pharmacokinetically rational regimen, given the half-life of these two DOACs.  In trials

frequency of gastrointestinal bleeding compared with warfarin (14 17).  Api[INVESTIGATOR_34214]-target side effects than rivaroxaban, which can cause severe headache 
(necessitating urgent head CT) and severe rash.   
 
Based on the emerging evidence that provoked VTE patients may require extended-
duration anticoagulation for secondary prevention, the api[INVESTIGATOR_3822] 2.5 mg twice daily 
dose could be a critical addition to our armamentarium in those at high risk for 
recurrence at the transition of care from the acute to the chronic treatment phase.  
However, this hypothesis needs to be tested in a clinical trial.  We propose a single-
(BWH) to evaluate the feasibility of low-dose api[INVESTIGATOR_3822] (2.5 mg twice daily) in a study 
population exclusively comprised of provoked VTE patients with persistently 
provoking risk factors for VTE. 
 
 
Rationale for the Proposed Study and Trial Design 
 
The rationale for the study design is focused on the lack of data on the safety and 
efficacy of extended-duration low-dose api[INVESTIGATOR_34215].  A single-center, randomized placebo-controlled trial of extended 
low-intensity api[INVESTIGATOR_34216] a study population enriched for recurrent VTE event rates 
will be able to provide such data.   
 
The rationale for a single-center study is that Watkins Cardiovascular Clinic at BWH 
is a Center of Excellence for thrombosis care not only in the New England region but 
also along the East coast.  The BWH Thrombosis Center evaluates an average of 
[ADDRESS_33742], low-dose 
rivaroxaban 10 mg orally daily was effective and safe in the EINSTEIN CHOICE trial 
(2) for extended-duration anticoagulation in secondary prevention after unprovoked 
VTE.  Second, AMPLIFY-EXT demonstrated efficacy and enhanced safety to a low-
dose api[INVESTIGATOR_34217] (2.5 mg orally twice daily) for extended-duration 
anticoagulation in secondary prevention after predominantly unprovoked VTE (7).  
Finally, because the relative risk of recurrence is less (although still unacceptably 
high) for provoked VTE than unprovoked VTE, a lower dose of api[INVESTIGATOR_34218] a reduction in the risk of major and clinically-relevant 
non-major bleeding. 
 
The rationale for using low-dose api[INVESTIGATOR_34219] a study population that will include 
obese patients is that an analysis of the AMPLIFY-EXT data by [CONTACT_34320] (7). 
 
The rationale for using a placebo-control is that current evidence-based guidelines do 
not recommend any extended thromboprophylactic measures after provoked VTE.  
Trials of low-dose aspi[INVESTIGATOR_34220] a mixed population of unprovoked and provoked VTE.  In the 
EINSTEIN CHOICE trial, low-dose aspi[INVESTIGATOR_34221] a bleeding risk similar 
to anticoagulation with rivaroxaban and a recurrent VTE rate 70% higher than 
anticoagulation with rivaroxaban (2). 
 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_34222].  First, the HI-PRO trial will include atherosclerotic 
cardiovascular disease, which will enrich the study population in VTE events because 
of the strong pathophysiological link between the two (18 21).  Many of these 
patients will be receiving low-
eligible patients will be receiving low-
cardiovascular events.  Excluding these patients would significantly hinder 
enrollment.  Finally, none of the major landmark trials of low-intensity api[INVESTIGATOR_3822] (2.5 
mg twice daily) excluded patients taking low- -EXT 
and ADOPT allowed up to 165 mg of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_34223] (7,22).   
 
Atherosclerosis is associated with an increased risk of VTE.  A link between 
atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and VTE was first suggested by [CONTACT_34321], who observed that the presence of carotid plaque was associated with a 
doubling in VTE risk (23).  Many risk factors for VTE, such as obesity, hypertension, 
dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], diabetes, and smoking, overlap with those for atherosclerosis (21,24).  
The link between VTE and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease also appears to be 
reciprocal.  A recent analysis of TRA2P-TIMI 50 (Thrombin Receptor Antagonist in 
Secondary Prevention of Atherothrombotic Ischemic Events-Thrombolysis in 
Myocardial Infarction) and PEGASUS-TIMI 54 (Prevention of Cardiovascular Events 
in Patients With Prior Heart Attack Using Ticagrelor Compared to Placebo on a 
Background of Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248]-Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 54) demonstrated the

 risk of VTE increased with the number of symptomatic vascular territories affected by 
[CONTACT_34322] (18).  A recent editorial in Circulation called for medicine to abandon 
the dichotomized view of VTE as provoked or unprovoked and called for the basis of 
the optimal duration of anticoagulation to be determined by [CONTACT_34323], 
including cardiovascular disease (5).  Because of the potential for a majority of 
patients in the study to have atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease limiting the 
generalizability of the results, up to 35% in each study group may have 
atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease as a qualifying persistent risk factor. 
 
The rationale for enrollment at 3-months is derived from the [ADDRESS_33743] Physicians (ACCP) evidence-based clinical practice document entitled 
with proximal DVT or pulmonary embolism (PE), we recommend 
long-
(Kearon C, Akl EA, Ornelas J, et al. Antithrombotic Therapy for VTE Disease: CHEST 
Guideline and Expert Panel Report. Chest 2016;149:315-52).  This statement 
supports the 3-month timepoint as an appropriate juncture to determine whether 
extended duration anticoagulation or discontinuation of antithrombotic therapy is 
appropriate.  
 
The 2016 ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines rely upon a more 
traditional classification for determining the risk of VTE recurrence after 3 months, a 
that has subsequently fallen out of favor.  The 2016 ACCP guidance document states 
the following regarding extended-duration antithrombotic therapy for prevention of 
recurrent VTE: 
 
recommend treatment with anticoagulation for 3 months over (i) treatment of a 
shorter period (Grade 1B), (ii) treatment of a longer time-limited period (eg, 6, 12, or 
24 months) (Grade 1B), or (iii) extended therapy (no scheduled stop date) (Grade 
1B). 
 
In patients with a proximal DVT of the leg or PE provoked by a nonsurgical transient 
risk factor, we recommend treatment with anticoagulation for 3 months over (i) 
treatment of a shorter period (Grade 1B) and (ii) treatment of a longer time-limited 
period (eg, 6, 12, or 24 months) (Grade 1B). We suggest treatment with 
anticoagulation for 3 months over extended therapy if there is a low or moderate 
bleeding risk (Grade 2B), and recommend treatment for [ADDRESS_33744] enduring risk factors for recurrence, such 
as those with persistent immobility, obesity, heart failure, chronic lung disease, 
chronic kidney disease, chronic inflammatory/autoimmune disorder, and 
atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (Albertsen IE, Pi[INVESTIGATOR_3818] G, Goldhaber SZ. Let's

More recently, the 2019 European Society of Cardiology Guidelines for the Diagnosis 
and Management of Acute Pulmonary Embolism, developed in collaboration with the 
European Respi[INVESTIGATOR_3764] (ERS), have recognized the importance of identifying 
persistent, or enduring, risk factors for VTE recurrence (Konstantinides SV, Meyer G, 
Becattini C, et al. 2019 ESC Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of acute 
pulmonary embolism developed in collaboration with the European Respi[INVESTIGATOR_16362] (ERS). Eur Heart J 2019).  This paradigm shift away from the previous 
endorsed by [CONTACT_34324] (ISTH), which 
recommends that clinicians consider persistent predisposing factors when 
determining whether to extend anticoagulation beyond 3 months (Kearon, C, Ageno, 
W, Cannegieter, SC, Cosmi, B, Geersing, G J and Kyrle, PA, for the Subcommittees 
on Control of Anticoagulation, and Predictive and Diagnostic Variables in Thrombotic 
Disease. Categorization of patients as having provoked or unprovoked venous 
thromboembolism: guidance from the SSC of ISTH. J Thromb Haemost 2016; 14: 
1480-3). 
 
Accordingly, the [ADDRESS_33746] upon recognition of 
both transient risk factors for VTE but also the presence of persistent, or enduring, 
conditions that result in a prolonged risk of VTE recurrence after an initial event.  
These include chronic medical disorders like inflammatory bowel disease, connective 
tissue disease, and other hypercoagulable states.  Rather than dichotomizing VTE 
patients in
Guidelines recommend assessment of persistent predisposing factors and an 
estimated long-term recurrence risk (if anticoagulation is discontinued after 3 
months).  The Guidelines suggest that only patients with an estimated recurrence risk 
of less than 3% per year should receive time-limited treatment (see figure below).  
Patients with greater than 8% risk of recurrence per year (for example, those with 
cancer-related VTE) are mandated to receive indefinite duration anticoagulation.  
There is clinical and research equipoise for the patient population that has an 
intermediate risk for recurrence (3-8% risk of recurrence per year). 
 
The inclusion and exclusion criteria for the current study follows the evidence-based 
clinical practice guideline recommendations from the ESC and ISTH and identify a 
population of patients with VTE who have a 3-8% of VTE recurrence per year.  We 
have estimated a 12-month VTE recurrence rate of 6% in our proposed study 
population, exactly within this range of clinical and research equipoise.

contraception must be discussed in the event that the subject chooses to forego 
complete abstinence. 
 
A woman of childbearing potential is defined as any female who has experienced 
menarche and who has not undergone surgical sterilization (hysterectomy or bilateral

follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level > 40mIU/mL to confirm menopause. 
 
*Females treated with hormone replacement therapy (HRT) are likely to have 
artificially suppressed FSH levels and may require a washout period in order to obtain 
a physiologic FSH level. The duration of the washout period is a function of the type 
of HRT used. The duration of the washout period below are suggested guidelines and 
the investigators should use their judgement in checking serum FSH levels. If the 
serum FSH level is > 40 mIU/ml at any time during the washout period, the woman 
can be considered postmenopausal:

Treatment Description   
 
Subjects will begin anticoagulation within 3 weeks of passing the screening 
procedure.  Subjects who are 18 years of age or older with provoked DVT and/or PE, 
have completed at least [ADDRESS_33763] one persistent provoking risk factor will be randomly 
assigned to receive api[INVESTIGATOR_3822] 2.5 mg orally twice daily or oral placebo for extended 
secondary prevention of VTE for a duration of 12 months.

 Safety Outcomes
 
Primary Safety Outcome 
 
The primary safety outcome will be major bleeding at 12 months.  Major bleeding is 
 
site, or contributes to death (27).  The primary safety outcome will be independently 
adjudicated by a blinded Clinical Endpoints Committee (CEC) review. 
 
Secondary Safety Outcome 
 
Clinically relevant non-major bleeding at 12 months will be evaluated (please see 
below) and is defined as overt bleeding that does not meet the criteria for major 
bleeding but that is associated with the need for medical intervention, unscheduled 
contact [CONTACT_4490] a physician, interruption or discontinuation of the study drug, or 
discomfort or impairment of activities of daily living (28).   
 
 
Efficacy Outcomes 
 
Primary Efficacy Outcome  
 
The primary efficacy outcome will be symptomatic, recurrent VTE, defined as the 
composite of deep vein thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism at [ADDRESS_33765] on computed tomographic (CT) venography, 
magnetic resonance (MR) venography, or contrast venography.   
 
PE is diagnosed based on new mismatched perfusion defect(s) on ventilation 
perfusion scan, the presence of a new pulmonary artery filling defect on contrast-
enhanced chest CT, a new finding of intraluminal filling defect on invasive pulmonary 
angiography, or evidence of PE at autopsy. 
 
Secondary Efficacy Outcome  
 
A secondary efficacy outcome will be the composite of death due to cardiovascular 
cause, nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), stroke or systemic embolism, critical limb 
ischemia (CLI), or coronary or peripheral ischemia requiring revascularization (major 
adverse cardiovascular events, including major adverse limb events) at [ADDRESS_33766] 2 of the 3 following conditions (29):
 The detection of a rise and/or fall of cardiac biomarkers, with at least one of 
the values being elevated (preferably cardiac troponin [cTn] with at least one 
value above the 99th percentile upper reference limit) and with at least one of 
the following:   
 symptoms of myocardial ischemia  
 new (or presumably new) significant ST-segment/T-wave changes 
or left bundle branch block  
 development of pathological Q waves on ECG  
 new loss of viable myocardium or regional wall motion abnormality 
by [CONTACT_34331] a new, focal neurologic deficit of sudden onset, lasting 
at least 24 hours, not due to a readily identifiable nonvascular cause (i.e. brain tumor, 
trauma), as confirmed by a neurologist and neuroimaging (7). All strokes during the 
study will be assessed by [CONTACT_9663], and classified as primary hemorrhagic, 
non-hemorrhagic, infarction with hemorrhagic conversion, or unknown, as defined by 
[CONTACT_9664]. 
 
 Primary hemorrhagic:  a stroke with documentation on imaging (e.g., 
CT scan or magnetic resonance imaging) of hemorrhage in the cerebral 
parenchyma, or subarachnoid hemorrhage. Evidence of hemorrhagic 
stroke obtained from lumbar puncture, neurosurgery, or autopsy can 
also confirm the diagnosis.  
 Non-hemorrhagic:  an ischemic focal neurological deficit (and not due 
to hemorrhage) that appears and is still partially evident at 24 hours. 
 Infarction with hemorrhagic conversion:  no evidence of hemorrhage 
on an initial scan, but found on a subsequent scan and is clinically 
relevant to the event, as determined by a neurologist. 
 Unknown type/no imaging performed:  the type of stroke could not be 
determined by [CONTACT_9665] (lumbar puncture, 
neurosurgery). 
 
Cardiovascular death is defined as a death for which a definite non-cardiovascular 
cause (e.g. cancer) has not been identified. Uncertain causes of deaths are 
presumed to be cardiovascular unless proven otherwise. 
 
Major adverse limb events include acute limb ischemia (ALI) and critical limb 
ischemia (CLI) (30).  Acute limb ischemia is defined as limb-threatening ischemia 
which is confirmed by [CONTACT_34332] (i.e. pharmacologic [heparin, thrombolysis], peripheral arterial 
surgery/reconstruction, peripheral angioplasty/stent, or amputation) within 30 days of 
onset of symptoms. In the absence of confirmation by [CONTACT_34361], absent pedal pulses is acceptable as hemodynamic criterion for acute limb 
ischemia. If the event does not meet the definition for ALI it may be classified as 
HI-PRO Trial    
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_3818], et al.  
November 19, 2021 
28 
 chronic limb ischemia, peripheral vascular intervention or other peripheral vascular
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. 
 
CLI is defined as continuing ischemic limb, foot or digit pain leading to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34232], or Fontaine 3 or 4 at baseline 
with peripheral intervention during the trial. 
 
Peripheral vascular intervention is defined as peripheral vascular intervention not 
meeting the definition for ALI or CLI. 
 
Additional Study Outcomes:   Admission for heart failure will also be assessed at 12 
months.  Adherence to the twice-daily regimen of api[INVESTIGATOR_3822] (and placebo) will be 
recorded as the total number of doses taken divided by [CONTACT_34333].  Adherence data will be recorded on patient-maintained drug diaries. 
 
Clinical Endpoints Committee Adjudication of Study Outcomes 
 
Primary and secondary safety and efficacy outcome will be independently 
adjudicated by a Clinical Endpoints Committee (CEC) that is blinded with regards to 
allocation (randomization).  The CEC will include a 
chairperson and independent reviewers who are physicians with experience in 
vascular medicine and thrombosis. The CEC will adjudicate all index events (proximal 
DVT and/or PE). During the study period and the post-treatment observation period, 
the CEC will adjudicate all suspected occurrences/recurrences of venous or arterial 
thromboembolic events, deaths, and the following events of special interest: acute 
myocardial infarction, acute stroke, and thrombocytopenia. The CEC will also review 
all suspected epi[INVESTIGATOR_34233], and categorize adjudicated bleeding as major, 
clinically relevant non-major, or minor bleeding. The Committee will be provided with 
all relevant documentation related to the events 
treatment allocation. The criteria and definitions of the study outcomes as well as the 
procedures followed by [CONTACT_34334]. 
 
Drug Accountability 
 
Study drug and placebo will be physically stored at BWH in our Investigational Drug 
Pharmacy.  Drug handling and dispensing will be accomplished through our BWH 
Investigational Drug Service.  The Director of Pharmacy at BWH will oversee the 
Investigational Drug Service in this regard for the purposes of the clinical trial.  
Documentation of administration will by [CONTACT_34335] (EHR; EPIC) in addition to a patient drug diary, which is being kept to assess 
medication adherence.  The Investigational Drug Service will collect empty study drug 
containers and unused drug via mail using prepaid labels that will be provided to the 
patient or courier as per Investigational Drug Service policy.  We will perform drug 
accountability assessment when the drug containers are collected at each 3-month 
interval.   
HI-PRO Trial    
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_3818], et al.  
November 19, [ADDRESS_33767] (EPIC).   
 
When our Research Nurse conducts the every 3-month telephone call in advance of 
releasing a 3-month allotment of study drug or placebo the subject will be queried for 
any issues with the study or adverse events.  
 
We will conduct an end-of-treatment visit to obtain data relevant to the study end 
points. 
 
We will assess medication adherence via pi[INVESTIGATOR_692].  Medication adherence will be 
calculated in three month intervals as the total number of doses taken divided by [CONTACT_34336] ([ x / 180] x 100 = medication 
adherence [%]) and also for the total 360-day study period ([x / 720] x 100 = 
medication adherence [%]).  Subjects will be given a study drug diary to fill out at 
home each day.  Subjects will write down the time they take their study drug and any 
side effects.  The study drug diary will be collected at a regularly scheduled office visit 
or the end-of-treatment visit  at conclusion of the study period.  
 
Subject Retention, Withdrawal, and Termination 
 
Continued participation of study subjects will be encouraged at the time of outpatient 
evaluation through the 12-month follow-up interval.  However, study subjects will be 
informed that they retain the right to withdraw from the study at any time without 
compromise to their current or subsequent medical care.  Subjects will be terminated 
from the study if they expi[INVESTIGATOR_9607].   
 
If study subjects elect to withdraw, they will be asked for permission to do the 
following: 
1. Be contact[CONTACT_9667] 
2. Have their physicians contact[CONTACT_34337]-PRO Trial

 Withdrawal criteria will include: 
1. Patient requests to withdraw 
2. Reasons related to SAE: 
a. Initiating or continuing study drug places the subject at undue hazard as 
determined by [CONTACT_737];   
b. SAE or other safety concern that is related to study drug treatment;   
c. Major or life-threatening bleeding (as defined in the protocol)  
d.  
e. Calculated CrCL decreased to < 30 mL/min confirmed by [CONTACT_34338], or need for dialysis 
3. Pregnancy 
4. Patient develops severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C) during the trial 
5. Death 
6. Lost to follow-up (every attempt will be made by [CONTACT_34339] 
- 
7. Study terminated by [CONTACT_3211] (termination of all or part of the study by [CONTACT_103], in concert with the study leadership) 
 
Safety Monitor 
 
An independent Safety Monitor has been selected for this study.  The Safety Monitor 
is an expert in VTE and is distinct from the DMSB and Study Staff and will be 
available throughout the study to assess patient safety issues that may arise, 
objectively.  The Safety Monitor will have the ability to break the blind of a study 
patient as the need arises (immediately, in real-time).  If the Safety Monitor is 
unavailable because of travel, one of the Physician Study Investigators will serve as 
back-up.  The Safety Monitor will attend DSMB meetings, although will be non-voting.  
The Safety Monitor will have the ability to request an ad hoc DSMB meeting should a 
safety issue arise that warrants further review. 
Assessment and Reporting of Adverse Events 
 
Definitions 
 
Adverse events 
 
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any new untoward medical occurrence or 
worsening of a pre-existing medical condition in a patient or clinical investigation subject 
administered an investigational (medicinal) product and that does not necessarily have 
a causal relationship with this treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or 
disease temporally associated with the use of investigational product, whether or not 
considered related to the investigational product.  The causal relationship to study drug 
is determined by a physician and should be used to assess all AEs.  
HI-PRO Trial    
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_3818], et al.  
November 19, [ADDRESS_33768]. (In order to prevent reporting 
bias, subjects should not be questioned regarding the specific occurrence of one or 
more adverse events). 
 
through 30 days of discontinuation of dosing will be reported to BMS Worldwide Safety. 
 
Serious Adverse Events 
 
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence at any dose that: 
  
 results in death 
 is life-threatening (defined as an event in which the subject was at risk of 
death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which 
hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe) 
 requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34234]/incapacity 
 is a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
 is an important medical event, defined as a medical event that may not be 
immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_313], based 
on appropriate medical and scientific judgment, may jeopardize the subject 
or may require intervention (e.g., medical, surgical) to prevent one of the 
other serious outcomes listed above. Examples of such events include but 
are not limited to intensive treatment in an emergency department or at 
home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do 
not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. 
 
Suspected transmission of an infectious agent (e.g., pathogenic or non-pathogenic) via the 
study drug is an SAE.  Although pregnancy, overdose, and cancer are not always serious 
by [CONTACT_8661], these events must be handled as SAEs. 
 
 The following hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8609]:  
 A visit to the emergency room or other hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34235] 24 hours that does not result in admission (unless considered an 
-threatening event) 
 Elective surgery planned before signing consent 
 Admissions as per protocol for a planned medical/surgical procedure 
 Routine health assessment requiring admission for baseline/trending of 
health status (e.g., routine colonoscopy) 
 Medical/surgical admission other than remedying ill health state that was 
planned before study entry. Appropriate documentation is required in these 
cases 
 Admission encountered for another life circumstance that carries no 
bearing on health status and requires no medical/surgical intervention (e.g.,

 lack of housing, economic inadequacy, caregiver respi[INVESTIGATOR_040], family 
circumstances, administrative reason) 
 
Adverse Events of Special Interest 
 
In this study, the following adverse events will to be reported to BMS, regardless of 
whether these reports are classified as serious or unexpected. 
 
 Potential or suspected cases of liver injury including but not limited to liver test 
abnormalities, jaundice, hepatitis or cholestasis. 
 
Pre-Existing Medical Conditions 
 
A pre-existing medical condition is one that is present at the start of the study.  Pre-
existing medical conditions should be recorded in the baseline and demographic data 
section of the electronic case report form (eCRF).  Pre-existing medical conditions 
should be reassessed during the trial and reported as an adverse event or severe 
adverse event only if the frequency, severity, or character of the conditions worsens 
significantly or unexpectedly during the study.  When reporting such adverse events, 
the description should convey that the pre-existing condition has changed by 
[CONTACT_9672] (e.g.

should not be considered adverse events. 
 
Serious Adverse Event Collecting and Reporting 
 
consent to participate in the study, all SAEs, whether 
related or not related to study drug, must be collected, including those thought to be 
associated with protocol-specified procedures. All SAEs must be collected that occur 
during the screening period and within [ADDRESS_33769] clinical practices. 
HI-PRO Trial    
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_3818], et al.  
November 19, 2021 
33 
 The investigator should report any SAE occurring after these time periods that is 
believed to be related to study drug or protocol-specified procedure.  An SAE report 
should be completed for any event where doubt exists regarding its status of 
seriousness.  If the investigator believes that an SAE is not related to study drug, but 
is potentially related to the conditions of the study (such as withdrawal of previous 
therapy, or a complication of a study procedure), the relationship should be specified 
in the narrative section of the SAE Report Form. 
 
SAEs, whether related or unrelated to the study drug, and pregnancies must be 
reported to BMS within 1 business day of becoming aware of the event:  
 
SAE Email Address:  [EMAIL_176] 
SAE Fax Number:  [PHONE_188] 
 
SAEs must be recorded on the FDA MedWatch Form 3500A. Pregnancies must be 
reported on a Pregnancy Surveillance Form. 
 
If only limited information is initially available, follow-up reports are required. (Note: 
Follow-up SAE reports should include the same investigator term(s) initially reported.)  
 
If an ongoing SAE changes in its intensity or relationship to study drug or if new 
information becomes available, a follow-up SAE report should be sent within 24 hours 
to the BMS (or designee) using the same procedure used for transmitting the initial 
SAE report. All SAEs should be followed to resolution or stabilization. 
 
SAE Reconciliation 
 
 
The Sponsor will reconcile the clinical database AE cases ( case level only ) 
transmitted to BMS Global Pharmacovigilance (GPV&E) 
([EMAIL_555] ).  
 The Investigator will request from BMS GPV&E, 
[EMAIL_177]  the SAE reconciliation report and include the 
BMS protocol number every 3 months and prior to data base lock or final data 
summary 
 GPV&E will send the investigator the report to verify and confirm all SAEs 
have been transmitted to BMS GPV&E. 
 The data elements listed on the GPV&E reconciliation report will be used for 
case identification purposes. If the Investigator determines a case was not 
transmitted to BMS GPV&E, the case should be sent immediately to BMS 
([EMAIL_555] ). 
 
Health Authority Reporting (U.S. FDA IND) 
 
HI-PRO Trial    
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_3818], et al.  
November 19, [ADDRESS_33770] adhere to local Health Authority Reporting Requirements. For 
studies conducted under an investigator sponsored U.S. FDA IND, provide details of 
the following: 
 
 Any event that is both serious and unexpected must be reported to the 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as soon as possible and no later than 
7 days (for a death or life-threatening event) or 15 days (for all other SAEs) 
 
 BMS will be provided with a simultaneous copy of all adverse events filed 
with the FDA. SAEs should be reported on MedWatch Form 3500A, which 
can be accessed at: http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/medwatch/. 
 
MedWatch SAE forms should be sent to the FDA at:

Fax: [PHONE_188] 
Email: [EMAIL_178] 
 
Health Authority (HA), suspected serious adverse reactions (whether expected or 
unexpected) shall be reported by [CONTACT_34340] (either as expedited and/or in 
aggregate reports). 
 In accordance with local regulations, BMS will notify sponsor investigators of all 
reported SAEs that are suspected (related to the investigational product) and 
unexpected (ie, not previously described in the IB)). An 
event meeting these criteria is termed a Suspected, Unexpected Serious 
Adverse Reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R). Sponsor investigator notification of these events 
will be in the form of either a S[LOCATION_003]R Report or a Semi-Annual S[LOCATION_003]R Report.  
 Other important findings which may be reported by [CONTACT_34341] (ESR) include: increased frequency of a clinically significant 
expected SAE, an SAE considered associated with study procedures that 
could modify the conduct of the study, lack of efficacy that poses significant 
hazard to study subjects, clinically significant safety finding from a 
nonclinical (eg, animal) study, important safety recommendations from a 
HI-PRO Trial    
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_3818], et al.  
November 19, [ADDRESS_33772] review and retain 
the ESR with the IB. Where required by [CONTACT_34342] a 
central IRB/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) for the study, the sponsor 
will submit the ESR to the appropriate IRB/IEC. The investigator and 
IRB/IEC will determine if the informed consent requires revision. The 
investigator should also comply with the IRB/IEC procedures for reporting 
any other safety information.  
 
 
Non-Serious Adverse Events  
 
A non-serious adverse event (NSAE) is an AE not classified as serious. 
 
Non-Serious Event Collecting and Reporting 
 
 
The collection of non-
written consent to participate in the study. All non-serious adverse events (not only 
those deemed to be treatment-related) should be collected continuously during the 
treatment period and for a minimum of [ADDRESS_33773] dose of study 
treatment.  
Non-serious AEs should be followed to resolution or stabilization, or reported as 
SAEs if they become serious. Follow-up is also required for non-serious AEs that 
cause interruption or discontinuation of study drug and for those present at the end of 
study treatment as appropriate.  
Non-serious Adverse Events (AE) are to be provided to BMS in aggregate via interim 
or final study reports as specified in the agreement or, if a regulatory requirement [eg, 
IND US trial] as part of an annual reporting requirement.  
 
Laboratory Test Abnormalities 
 
All laboratory test results captured as part of the study should be recorded following 
institutional procedures. Test results that constitute SAEs should be documented and 
reported to BMS as such. 
 
The following laboratory abnormalities should be captured and reported as 
appropriate: 
 
 Any laboratory test result that is clinically significant or meets the definition of an SAE 
 Any laboratory test result abnormality that required the subject to have study 
drug discontinued or interrupted 
HI-PRO Trial    
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_3818], et al.  
November 19, [ADDRESS_33774] to receive 
specific corrective therapy.  
 
It is expected that wherever possible, the clinical rather than the laboratory term will 
be used by [CONTACT_9673] (e.g., use the term anemia rather than low 
hemoglobin value).  Laboratory test abnormalities are provided to BMS via annual 
safety reports (if applicable), and interim or final study reports. 
 
Pregnancy 
 
If, following initiation of api[INVESTIGATOR_3822], it is subsequently discovered that a study subject is 
pregnant or may have been pregnant at the time of api[INVESTIGATOR_9612], including 
during at least [ADDRESS_33775] 
immediately notify [EMAIL_179] of this event via the Pregnancy 
Surveillance Form within [ADDRESS_33776] be recorded in the appropriate section of the eCRF. Procedures to 
expedite reporting serious adverse events are described later in this section.   
 
 
Specific Adverse Event Reporting Guidelines 
 
Study investigators should follow the following guidelines to ensure the quality and 
precision of adverse event reporting: 
1. Use recognized medical terms 
2. Avoid the use of colloquialisms and non-standard abbreviations 
3. If known at the time of adverse event reporting, a diagnosis should be reported 
instead of individual symptoms and signs (e.g.
 
4. If the reported symptoms and signs cannot be medically characterized as a 
single diagnosis or syndrome at the time of adverse event reporting, the 
information that is available should be reported.  If a diagnosis is subsequently 
established, it should be reported as follow-up information as described earlier. 
5. A cascade of clinical events (such as sequelae of an adverse event) should be 
identified as the primary, causative event.  The cascade of events can be 
further described in the adverse event narrative.  For example, when recording 
a death, the event or condition that caused or contributed to the fatal outcome 
should be reported as the serious adverse event.  If the cause of death is 
 
6. Any adverse event that results in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9613] a 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9614] a serious adverse event.  If a subject is 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9615] a medical or surgical procedure as a result of an 
adverse event, the event responsible for the procedure (not the procedure 
itself) should be reported as the serious adverse event.  For example, if a 
subject is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9616] a result of a major 
bleeding event, record the major bleeding event that necessitated surgery as 
the serious adverse event. 
 
HI-PRO Trial    
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_3818], et al.  
November 19, [ADDRESS_33777] be classified according to intensity or severity, 
expectedness, relatedness, outcome, and treatment or action taken. 
 
Intensity or Severity 
 
The following categories for intensity or severity of an adverse event should be used 
in reporting: 
 
Mild  Awareness of a symptom or sign that does not interfere with the 
treatment and without sequelae 
Moderate 
still able to function 
Severe daily activities and generally requires 
medication, surgery, or other intervention for treatment 
 
Expectedness 
 
Each adverse event should be evaluated as to whether it was expected or 
unexpected as follows: 
 
Expected The specificity and severity of the event is consistent with 
applicable information on api[INVESTIGATOR_3822]. 
Unexpected The specificity or severity of the event is not consistent with 
applicable information on api[INVESTIGATOR_3822].               
Unanticipated 
Adverse 
Device Effect 
(UADE) Any serious adverse effect on health or safety or any life-
threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with, 
api[INVESTIGATOR_3822], if that effect, problem, or death was not previously 
identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the 
investigational plan or application or any other unanticipated 
serious problem associated with api[INVESTIGATOR_34238], safety, or welfare of subjects.  
 
 
Relatedness 
 
Each adverse event should be evaluated as to whether it was related to the study 
procedures or api[INVESTIGATOR_9618]: 
 
Definite An adverse event is clearly related to api[INVESTIGATOR_34239]-PRO Trial    
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_3818], et al.  
November 19, 2021 
39 
 Probable An adverse event has a reasonable causal relationship to the 
use of api[INVESTIGATOR_3822]; another etiology is significantly less likely 
Possible An adverse event has a reasonable causal relationship to the 
use of api[INVESTIGATOR_3822]; an alternative etiology is equally or less likely  
Unlikely An adverse event has little or no causal relationship to the use 
of api[INVESTIGATOR_3822]; an alternative etiology is more likely 
Not related An adverse event is not related to the use of api[INVESTIGATOR_3822]; there is 
no temporal relationship or a much more likely alternative 
etiology exists 
 
causal relationship.  
 
Outcome 
 
The clinical course of all adverse events should be followed until a medical outcome 
is determined (resolution, stabilization, or determination that it was unrelated to study 
participation).  If a subject is pregnant or becomes pregnant within [ADDRESS_33778] to 
determine the outcome of the pregnancy (successful live-birth, etc.).  The clinical 
outcome of all adverse events should be recorded as follows: 
 
Death Patient expi[INVESTIGATOR_34240]: 
 
Intervention Surgery or other invasive procedure 
Non-surgical treatment Drug initiation, interruption, dose reduction, dose 
increase, or discontinuation 
None No action was taken 
 
Expedited Reporting of Serious Adverse Events (SAE) 
 
The study investigators must use the following procedure for reporting serious 
adverse events: 
1. Report any serious adverse event that occurs to the Sponsor within 24 hours 
of knowledge of the event (Monday through Friday).  If the investigator does 
HI-PRO Trial    
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_3818], et al.  
November 19, [ADDRESS_33779] all information regarding the SAE, he/she will not wait to receive 
additional information before notifying the Sponsor  of the event and 
completing the eCRF.  The investigator shall provide an event update when 
additional information is received. 
 
NOTE:  The Sponsor will automatically be notified when an adverse event or 
serious adverse event has been entered into the database when the 
investigator fills in an eCRF.  
 
2. In the reporting of serious adverse events, the study investigator shall provide 
any potentially relevant information including: 
a. Subject demographics 
b. Pre-existing conditions 
c. The complete description of the adverse event. 
d. Date and time of adverse event onset 
e. Severity 
f. Treatment 
g. Results of diagnostic testing 
h. Duration of sequelae 
i. Outcome (if known) 
j. Date and time of adverse event resolution. 
k. Information on suspected medications including dose, route of 
administration, frequency, dates, lot number, expi[INVESTIGATOR_320], and 
concomitant medications 
 
3. When reporting a death, the primary event or condition that caused or contributed 
to the fatal outcome shall be reported as the serious adverse event.  Death will be 
reported as the outcomes of the serious adverse event.  If the cause of death is 
unknown a  
 
4. The investigator shall report unanticipated adverse device effects (UADEs) to 
the sponsor and Institutional Review Board within [ADDRESS_33780] learns of the event.   
 
Sponsor Unanticipated Adverse Drug Effects (UADEs) Reporting Responsibilities 
 
Any serious adverse event determined to be caused by [CONTACT_9674][INVESTIGATOR_34241] U.S. Food and Drug Administration and IRBs.  Upon notice 
of an unanticipated adverse drug effect (UADE), the sponsor shall immediately 
conduct an evaluation of the UADE and report the results of the evaluation to the 
FDA, all reviewing IRBs, and participating investigators within [ADDRESS_33781] data will be collected using a web-based electronic case report form (eCRF) 
called REDCap.  Database monitoring and quality control will be performed by [CONTACT_34343] (DSMB). 
Monitoring Plan 
 
Monitoring procedures will consist of the following: 
 
During the study, the study staff shall perform monthly random reviews of data with 
checks for accuracy and completeness, and document that corrective actions have 
been taken in response to protocol deviations or other forms of non-compliance.  
These reports will be provided to the Data Safety Monitoring Board. 
 
Data Safety Monitoring Board  
 
Three independent individuals with relevant expertise in VTE and anticoagulation will 
be appointed to a data safety monitoring board (DSMB) whose primary responsibility 
is to protect the safety of study subjects and to provide ongoing, critical, and 
unbiased evaluation of the progress of the study. The DSMB will be comprised of two 
independent physicians and an independent statistician.  To further ensure 
idependence of the DSMB, the DSMB Chair has been selected and is an expert in 
VTE AND comes from outside the Mass General Brigham Network. 
 
The DSMB will: 
 Provide independent safety evaluation of events and adjudicate all actual and 
potential serious adverse events experienced by [CONTACT_34344], particularly death, symptomatic VTE and major bleeding; and 
can recommend premature stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_34242]. 
 
The DSMB will meet virtually via Zoom under the restrictions imposed by [CONTACT_25963]-
[ADDRESS_33782] once every three months for the duration of the trial in addition to prespecified 
meetings at 10 months and 50% of enrollment (Table).   In addition, the DSMB may 
be convened on an ad hoc basis at the request of the study investigators if the need 
(for example, due to a study-related concern) arises in between regularly scheduled 
meetings.  The DSMB chair may call an emergency meeting at any time should 
questions of patient safety arise or at the request of the Study Safety Monitor.  The 
exact dates and times of the DSMB meetings will be determined based on the 
availability of all three members to meet  and will take place within the first two weeks 
of the given month. 
HI-PRO Trial    
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_3818], et al.  
November 19, [ADDRESS_33783] point through the enrollment period 
(10 months).  At this point the DSMB will assess whether the study is on-track 
to meet its enrollment goal.  The DSMB will also assess any safety concerns at 
that time.  Once the review is complete and no safety or enrollment concerns 
are raised, the trial will continue. 
5. A DSMB meeting will also occur when 50% of the planned enrollment population 
has completed 12-month follow-up as part of the prespecified interim analysis.  
This planned interim analysis will inform the DSMB on whether the study should 
be stopped early due to efficacy, safety concerns, or futility or continue to enroll 
the full 600-patient cohort. 
6. A final DSMB meeting will take place after follow-up completion of the last 
subject. The DSMB will review all remaining safety data collected on the 
subjects enrolled. 
7. The DSMB chair may call an emergency meeting at any time should questions 
of patient safety arise or at the request of the independent Study Safety Monitor.  
All materials, discussions, and proceedings of the DSMB are completely 
confidential. The Chair and other participants present at DSMB meetings are 
expected to maintain confidentiality.

Blinding/Unblinding 
 
This study will be conducted in a blinded fashion. To maintain blinding of study 
treatment, study medications will be prepared using placebo matching the active 
treatments.  Subjects, Investigators, members of any of the administrative and 
adjudicating 
access to individual subject treatment assignments.  
 
Blinding is critical to the integrity of this clinical study. However, in the event of a 
medical emergency or pregnancy in an individual subject, in which knowledge of the 
investigational product is critical to the subject's management, the blind for that 
HI-PRO Trial    
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_3818], et al.  
November 19, [ADDRESS_33793] may be broken by [CONTACT_34346] (or if unavailable, the treating 
investigator). Before breaking the blind of an individual subject's treatment, the Safety 
Monitor should have determined that the information is necessary, i.e., that it will alter 
the subject's immediate management. In many cases, particularly when the 
emergency is clearly not investigational product-related, the problem may be properly 
managed by [CONTACT_34347]. 
 
The Safety Monitor should ensure that health care professionals who may provide 
any elective, urgent or emergent medical or surgical care for a subject after 
randomization are informed that: 
1. The subject is enrolled in a clinical study and is receiving blinded oral study 
treatment, consisting of: 
a.  Factor Xa inhibitor, OR 
b.  Placebo 
2. The factor Xa inhibitor is an anticoagulant, with a half-life of approximately [ADDRESS_33794]: 
 Will indicate that the subject is participating in a double-blind clinical trial. 
  
 Will note that the subject may be receiving either placebo or an 
investigational anticoagulant drug (a factor Xa inhibitor).

to surgery and invasive procedures, as well as the management of bleeding that may 
occur in subjects on study drugs. These are: 
 The risk of thromboembolism in an individual subject (low, intermediate or 
high). 
  The risk of bleeding associated with the procedure or surgery. 
 Whether the surgery or invasive procedure is elective or emergent in 
nature. 
 The desirability of maintaining blinding, if at all possible, without creating 
risk for the subject. 
 The times of onset and offset of anticoagulant effect for api[INVESTIGATOR_34244], local standards of care for discontinuation of anticoagulation prior to 
elective procedures/surgery should be employed; these may be informed by [CONTACT_34350]. 
 
These are summarized below: 
 Stop api[INVESTIGATOR_3822]/api[INVESTIGATOR_3822]-placebo 2-4 days before the planned procedure. 
 If the procedure is associated with an increased risk of thrombosis, brief 
postoperative protection with UFH or LMWH may be considered. 
 Restart api[INVESTIGATOR_3822]/api[INVESTIGATOR_3822]-placebo postoperatively (usually the day after 
surgery) when it is deemed safe to do so. If UFH/LMWH is used in the 
postoperative period, it is recommended that api[INVESTIGATOR_3822]/api[INVESTIGATOR_3822]-placebo 
begin: 
  [ADDRESS_33796] dose of UFH; 
  [ADDRESS_33797] dose of LMWH indicated for twice daily 
administration; or 
  [ADDRESS_33798] dose of LMWH indicated for once daily 
administration (or fondaparinux). 
 
Emergency Procedures 
 
For urgent or emergent invasive procedures, when waiting 4 - 5 days is not an option, 
management will in part depend on the randomized treatment assignment (placebo 
or api[INVESTIGATOR_3822]) and unblinding may be necessary (see Section on Blinding/Unblinding). 
Regardless of treatment, study drugs should be discontinued and standard laboratory 
coagulation tests (PT/INR, aPTT, platelet count, etc.) performed. The procedure 
should be carried out and in such a way to minimize the risk of bleeding. For subjects 
receiving api[INVESTIGATOR_3822], the risk of bleeding with invasive procedures is unknown. At 
therapeutic doses, the anticoagulant effects of api[INVESTIGATOR_34245]. Given its half-life (12 hours), however, the anticoagulant 
effect of api[INVESTIGATOR_34246] [ADDRESS_33799] dose may be treated with prothrombin 
complex concentrate or andexanet alfa.  If treatment with an alternative open label 
anticoagulant/antithrombotic is indicated for the procedure, it should be used at the 
lowest therapeutic dose (if at all) in the [ADDRESS_33800] dose of api[INVESTIGATOR_3822].  
 
Treatment Guidelines for Bleeding/Suspected Bleeding 
 
Subjects with bleeding or suspected bleeding will undergo confirmatory laboratory or 
other testing (e.g., US, CT, MRI) and a (S)AE CRF must be completed. The date and 
time of the onset of the bleeding event will be recorded on the CRF. 
 
For subjects with minor bleeding, study drug may or may not be held at the discretion 
of the local physician and investigator. A risk/benefit determination should be made 
 
thromboembolism and benefit from continued anticoagulation. Minor bleeding should 
otherwise be managed according to local standard of care. 
 
For subjects with clinically significant bleeding, the study drugs should generally be 
held. Bleeding should be managed according to local standard of care and may 
include measures such as: 
 
 Local measures to stop the bleeding 
 Volume resuscitation, and transfusion of blood products as appropriate 
 Standard laboratory tests (e.g., hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelet count, 
etc.) 
 
Note: Neither api[INVESTIGATOR_34247]. 
 
The management of clinically significant bleeding will in part depend on the 
randomized treatment assignment (placebo or api[INVESTIGATOR_3822]) so unblinding may be 
necessary (see Section on Blinding/Unblinding). Should unblinding occur, subjects 
receiving placebo should be managed according to the local standard of care. 
Given its half-life (12 - 15 hours), however, the anticoagulant effect of api[INVESTIGATOR_34248] 24 - 48 hours. Subjects receiving api[INVESTIGATOR_34249] (PCC) or andexanet alfa as per Good Clinical Practice and local 
anticoagulant reversal protocols. 
 
Management of Recurrent Venous Thromboembolic Events 
 
If a subject has a confirmed recurrent symptomatic VTE (DVT or PE), as deemed by 
[CONTACT_34351], then the patient must discontinue study treatment and 
transition to the appropriate standard of care. The subject should remain in the study 
and should be followed in the same manner as a subject who has discontinued study 
treatment as described in the protocol.

 Prohibited and/or Restricted Treatments 
 
Prohibited Treatments: 
 
The following medications or therapi[INVESTIGATOR_34250]: 
 Potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., azole antifungals [itraconazole and 
ketoconazole], macrolide antibiotics [clarithromycin and telithromycin], 
protease inhibitors [ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, atazanavir, and saquinavir], 
and nefazadone) 
 Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] > 81 mg/day 
 Dual antiplatelet therapy such as concomitant (simultaneous) use of both 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_34251] a thienopyridine (e.g., clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745], ticlopi[INVESTIGATOR_5325]) 
 Other antithrombotic agents (e.g., UFH, LMWH, direct thrombin inhibitors, 
fondaparinux)  
 GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors (e.g., abciximab, eptifibatide, tirofiban) 
 
If treatment with a prohibited agent becomes necessary, study drug should be 
temporarily interrupted, and restarted as soon as possible following discontinuation of 
the prohibited medication or therapy. 
 
Restricted Treatments: 
 
The administration of the following agents in subjects on study drug should be done 
cautiously given the increased risk of bleeding. In such cases, consideration of 
interruption of the study drug may be warranted; this decision should be made after a 
careful assessment of the risks and potential benefits. 
 
Examples: 
 Chronic (> 3 months) daily NSAIDs. NSAIDs should not be administered in 
doses that exceed those in the approved label 
 Cytotoxic/myelosuppressive therapy 
 
In addition, if a subject is currently receiving an agent that is a potent inducer of

recommendations to terminate the study if the safety and well-being of the 
subjects is in jeopardy.  
B. If the study is terminated or suspended, prompt notification will be provided 
to all parties of the study. 
C. Patient enrollment may be paused or terminated early if the DSMB 
determines that the potential benefits of continuing the trial are unlikely to 
outweigh the risks.  For example, if the probability of achieving the target 
primary endpoints falls below a certain threshold, the trial will be stopped or 
paused for re-evaluation.

Statistical Methods 
 
Sample Size Calculation 
 
This study is a 600-patient single-center, randomized controlled trial utilizing an 
enriched population.  Based on the contemporary (within the last 10 years) large 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_34260] (2,3,7) and a large meta-analysis of 
low-dose aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] (31) for prevention of recurrent events in patients with initial 
unprovoked VTE or clinically suspected to have a high risk of recurrence, we 
conservatively estimate an average 12-month VTE recurrence rate in patients not 
treated with extended-duration anticoagulation (placebo group) of 6% (Table 2).

In EINSTEIN CHOICE which randomized 60% of patients with provoked VTE, the 
control group received low-dose aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] (which based on a meta-analysis in 
unprovoked VTE patients confers about a 33% relative risk reduction) had a 
recurrence rate of 3.6% (2,31).  Accordingly, we would expect the 12-month VTE 
recurrence rate to be at least 33% higher in patients assigned to placebo in the 
proposed study and therefore approximately 5-6%.  The recurrent VTE rate among 
placebo patients in the AMPLIFY-EXT trial of api[INVESTIGATOR_34261] a bit higher at 8.8% 
(7).  By [CONTACT_34352] (persistent immobility, obesity, heart failure, chronic lung disease, chronic 
kidney disease, inflammatory disorder, or atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease), we 
2-fold (all of these persistent provoking risk factors increase the risk of VTE by 2-4-
fold; Table 3) (32).  Many patients enrolled in the study will have multiple persistent 
provoking VTE risk factors (for example, heart failure, obesity, and atherosclerotic 
cardiovascular disease) and thereby [CONTACT_34353].   In an 
effort to be ultra-conservative, we kept the multiplier for this enriched study population 
to 2-fold (while in reality for many study patients it could be 4-fold or even higher).  
Accordingly, our estimate of a 12-month VTE recurrence rate of 6% is very 
conservative and still below the VTE recurrence rates reported in EINSTEIN VTE 
Continued Treatment and AMPLIFY EXT (neither of which included an enriched 
population).

Based on the data from EINSTEIN CHOICE, we conservatively estimate that low-
intensity api[INVESTIGATOR_3822] (2.5 mg twice daily) compared with placebo will provide a similar 
HI-PRO Trial    
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_3818], et al.

51 
 reduction (75%) in recurrent VTE as low-intensity rivaroxaban (10 mg daily) 
compared with low-dose aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] (2).  The 75% relative risk reduction was reported 
specifically for recurrent VTE and in the provoked VTE patient population, comparing 
rivaroxaban [ADDRESS_33803] randomized controlled trial analysis.  If anything, the 
reduction in the proposed study should be even greater since we propose a placebo-
control instead of active (aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248]) control and we will be following our patients for 12 
months, instead of allowing shorter follow-up as was reported in EINSTEIN CHOICE.  
Accordingly, assuming an estimated incidence in the placebo group of 6% at 12 
months and a decrease in the primary outcome of 75% with api[INVESTIGATOR_3822] 2.[ADDRESS_33804] 80% power to show the superiority of 
low-intensity api[INVESTIGATOR_34262], at a two-sided alpha level of 0.05.  To account 
for patients who may be lost to follow-up or withdraw from the study, we will recruit 
[ADDRESS_33805] 3 months of anticoagulant 
therapy in accordance with current and widely-accepted evidence-based clinical 
practice guidelines (Eur Heart J. 2020; 41: [ADDRESS_33806]. 2016;149:315-352, and 
Circulation. 2011;123:1788 1830).  Data from the PADIS-PE study showed that the 
rate of VTE recurrence is higher closer in temporal proximity to the initial event, such 
that the recurrence rate is higher at 3-6 months after diagnosis than it is at 6-12 
months (Couturaud F, et al. Six Months vs Extended Oral Anticoagulation After a 
First Epi[INVESTIGATOR_34263]. JAMA. 2015;314(1):31-40).  Accordingly, the 
anticipated event rate should be higher in our study than EINSTEIN-CHOICE and the 
resultant observed relative risk reduction is likely to be higher. 
 
Sensitivity analyses performed for the comparison between api[INVESTIGATOR_3822] 2.5 mg twice 
daily and placebo (Tables 4 - 6) show that our sample size is most sensitive to 
change in the impact of the extended duration anticoagulation.  However, we have 
been very conservative in our effect size calculation and baseline recurrent VTE rate 
(for example, we have not taken into account the increase in event rates of an 
enriched population with persistent immobility, obesity, heart failure, chronic lung 
disease, chronic kidney disease, inflammatory disorder, or atherosclerotic 
cardiovascular disease), as above.

The sample size calculation for the trial was calculated based upon 12-month rates of 
recurrent VTE from pi[INVESTIGATOR_34264] (2,3,7,33) and a large meta-
analysis of low-dose aspi[INVESTIGATOR_34265]. placebo (31).  Accordingly, assuming an estimated 
incidence in the placebo group of 6% at 12 months and a decrease in the primary 
outcome of 75% with api[INVESTIGATOR_3822] 2.[ADDRESS_33807] 
80% power to show the superiority of low-intensity api[INVESTIGATOR_34262], at a two-
sided alpha level of 0.05.  If the trial utilized 6-month follow-up instead of 12-month, 
we would observe fewer recurrent VTE events and would require an increase in the 
sample size, which would require a longer enrollment period and would incur greater 
cost.  As such, we have determined 12-month follow-up to facilitate the most efficient 
and cost-effective trial. 
 
We have conducted a retrospective analysis using an ongoing BWH registry of 405 
patients with pulmonary embolism/deep vein thrombosis.  We identified [ADDRESS_33808] one provoking risk factor.  Among those who 
received 3-6 months of anticoagulation, 11.1% developed symptomatic recurrent 
venous thromboembolism in the ensuing year after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_34266].  If we 
utilize this baseline rate of recurrent VTE in our sample size calculation, we will 
require 212 patients in each study group, assuming a 75% relative risk reduction with 
api[INVESTIGATOR_3822] 2.5 mg twice daily compared with placebo and 90% power to show the 
superiority of low-intensity api[INVESTIGATOR_34262], at a two-sided alpha level of 0.05.   
 
We have also consulted with an independent biostatistician from the Harvard Catalyst 
Biostatistics Program (Shelley Hurwitz, PhD) to review our sample size requirement.  
She confirmed our sample size calculation using a recurrent VTE rate in the placebo

It was also suggested that we consider using the lower limit of the 95% confidence 
interval around our estimate of 11.1%, which would be 8.2%.  The statistician 
suggested that this would also provide a conservative estimate of the frequency of 
recurrent VTE for the sample size calculation (see Table 8 below).

Statistical Analysis Plan 
 
For this study, we will calculate: 
1) the 12-month frequency of major and clinically relevant non-major bleeding 
2) the 12-month frequency of symptomatic recurrent VTE 
 
The primary efficacy objective of this trial is to determine whether api[INVESTIGATOR_3822] 2.5 mg 
twice daily is superior to placebo for the primary endpoint of symptomatic, 
recurrent VTE after 12 months of extended therapy.  The analysis will include 
descriptive statistics of event rates and 95% CI, and risk difference and 95% CI. The 
Mantel-Haenszel statistic will be used to test this hypothesis formally.  Superiority 
over placebo will be claimed for a dose if the Hochberg adjusted p-
and the RR is < 1.  The analysis will be supported by [CONTACT_5263]-Meier curves.  The 
primary efficacy outcome analysis will be intention-to-treat.  We will also perform an 
on-treatment analysis. 
 
The primary safety objective will be to determine whether api[INVESTIGATOR_3822] 2.5 mg twice daily 
results in a statistically significant difference in major bleeding at 12 months (during 
the treatment period) compared with placebo. Analysis of incidence of these 
endpoints will be based on the safety analysis set. The analysis will include 
descriptive statistics of event rates and 95% CI, and risk difference and 95% CI. 
Hypotheses will be tested using Mantel-Haenszel statistic.  The analysis will be 
supported by [CONTACT_5263]-Meier curves of the time to first adjudicated major bleeding 
event.  All bleeding analyses will be conducted on the safety dataset. 
 
Baseline characteristics will be summarized by [CONTACT_19313]. Any imbalances between the 
treatment groups for any demographic or baseline characteristic will be assessed based 
on clinical relevance in reviewing the summaries. For any differences deemed clinically 
relevant to the efficacy comparisons, exploratory analyses that include the imbalanced 
factor as a categorized covariate will be performed. 
 
To account for the effect of baseline low-dose aspi[INVESTIGATOR_34267], we will perform a pre-specified 
stratified efficacy analysis of patients receiving low-dose api[INVESTIGATOR_34268]-
dose aspi[INVESTIGATOR_34269]-dose api[INVESTIGATOR_34201].  We 
will calculate stratum-
unadjusted) and stratum-specific risk ratios will enable us to determine whether aspi[INVESTIGATOR_34270]-dose api[INVESTIGATOR_34271].  If the stratum-specific risk 
ratio is similar to the crude risk ratio, then there is minimal impact of low-dose aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248]. 
However, if the stratum-specific risk ratio differs from the unadjusted estimate by 10% or 
more, then low-dose aspi[INVESTIGATOR_34272]-dose api[INVESTIGATOR_3822].  We will conduct a 
similar analysis for the safety outcome of major bleeding.

 We will also pre-specify subgroup analyses focused on the safety and efficacy of major 
 65 years), women, and those 
with persistent provoking factors of immobility, obesity, heart failure, chronic lung 
disease, chronic kidney disease, hemodialysis, chronic inflammatory/autoimmune 
disorder, and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. 
 
Means, medians, and frequency distributions will be calculated for continuous 
variables.  Number and percentages will be reported for binary and categorical 
variables.  Differences between subgroups of interest will be examined using the chi-
square or Fish -test or 
Wilcoxon Rank Sum for continuous variables (if the subgroups are of sufficient size 
for statistical comparison).   
 
Safety outcome analyses will be performed among patients who received one or 
more doses of a study drug (Safety Population).  All p-values reported will be two-
sided. A p-value < 0.[ADDRESS_33813] a pre-specified interim analysis to assess the primary safety and 
efficacy outcomes after 50% of the planned enrollment population has completed 12-
month follow-up.  This planned interim analysis will inform the Data Safety Monitoring 
Board on whether the study should be stopped early due to efficacy, safety concerns, 
or futility or continue to enroll the full 600-patient cohort.

Medicine, Harvard Medical School and Interim Chief of the Division of Cardiovascular 
Medicine and Section Head of Vascular Medicine, is based at BWH and Harvard 
Medical School.  The Thrombosis Research Group has a decades-long commitment

for VTE.  [CONTACT_9688][INVESTIGATOR_3818], Associate Professor of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, is the

Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_34278] 2.5 mg twice daily for prevention of VTE

The Thrombosis Research Group has an infrastructure of experienced leadership, 
with trained personnel in a multidisciplinary academic team (research pharmacists, 
cardiology fellows, research nurses, research coordinators, biostatisticians, 
administrators, and medical informatics specialists).  Data storage and computing 
resources, as well as a network of regional, national, and international collaborating 
investigators, facilitate our execution of ongoing research projects and our planning of 
future research projects.  The Thrombosis Research Group has studied all aspects of 
VTE, including epi[INVESTIGATOR_623], diagnosis, treatment, and prevention.  According to 
www.pubmed.gov, the group has authored more than [ADDRESS_33817] extensive experience leading randomized controlled 
trials focused on prevention and treatment of thromboembolic disease.  Examples of 
major Thrombosis Research Group-lead trials in this area include the 2500-patient 
multicenter Electronic Alert Trial (40), the 2500-patient multicenter Physician Alert 
Trial (41), the 2500-patient Discharge Alert Trial (42), and the 85-patient multicenter 
eTRIS trial (35).   
 
Vascular Medicine at BWH is a regional Center of Excellence for VTE care.  An EPIC 
Electronic Health Record query of the outpatient clinic volume of the five Vascular 
Medicine faculty providers and the 4 full-time Vascular Medicine fellows

(patients/year) 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_3818] [ADDRESS_33818]. Lee, we 
calculate 1600 new and follow-up provoked VTE patients who present for outpatient 
visits at BWH per year and we conservatively estimate that 25% will fail to meet all 
the inclusion criteria or will meet at least one exclusion criterion.  Therefore, an 
estimated [ADDRESS_33819] year and 800 patients in the 8 months that comprise the 
second year of enrollment.  This will yield 2000 patients from which to enroll 600 
subjects for the trial.

 Based on our prior clinical trial experience at the BWH Thrombosis Research Group, 
we conservatively estimate that 50% of the patients who are screened and found to 
be eligible for the trial will consent to participate.  Therefore, an estimated [ADDRESS_33820] an adequate reserve in staffing and 
flexibility to augment our effort should enrollment require it. 
 
 
TRG led the patient recruitment effort for the Cardiovascular Inflammation Reduction 
Trial (CIRT), a randomized, double-blind trial of low-dose methotrexate in 4786 
patients with previous myocardial infarction or multivessel coronary disease who 
additionally had either type 2 diabetes or the metabolic syndrome (39).  CIRT was a 
landmark study which involved a novel application of a challenging anti-inflammatory 
drug, serial laboratory evaluations, and a high number of follow-up phone calls and 
in-person office visits, which required patients to travel from as far as [LOCATION_004] to 
[LOCATION_011].  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_34280], TRG made BWH the overall top enrolling site in 
the CIRT trial. 
 
We anticipate rapid enrollment in the HI-PRO trial.  First, all the patients in the study 
will be familiar with anticoagulation and many will have received api[INVESTIGATOR_3822].  Second, 
there are no study-mandated laboratory tests or office visits.  Third, many patients 
with provoked VTE are reluctant to discontinue anticoagulation after the acute 
treatment phase because of the fear of recurrent events.  We anticipate that many 
patients with provoked VTE will be highly interested in participating in a clinical trial of 
extended secondary prevention thromboprophylaxis, especially with the favorable 
safety and efficacy profile of low-intensity api[INVESTIGATOR_3822].  It is quite possible that greater 
than 50% of eligible patients will want to participate and provide informed consent.  In 
such a scenario, we would expect to enroll more quickly.

The risk of research procedures includes psychological discomfort from participating in a 
clinical trial (less likely) and loss of confidentiality of medical records or economic data (rare).   
 
Women of childbearing potential (able to get pregnant) must have a negative pregnancy 
test before being considered for the study.  It is not known how api[INVESTIGATOR_34282]. Women of childbearing potential must use an effective method of birth

Protection of Subjects against the Risks of Research Procedures 
 
Before Study Enrollment 
 
A rigorous screening process will be utilized to ensure that subjects with an increased 
risk of harm due to enrollment in the study are excluded from the study.  This will 
include performing a detailed history and physical examination (to ensure that enrolled 
subjects truly fulfill all eligibility criteria) and carefully reviewing the results of laboratory 
testing (in particular, hematocrit, platelet count, INR, and serum creatinine).   
 
During Follow-Up 
 
Changes in health status during the 12-month follow-up period will be evaluated by 
, and other routine providers.  All subjects enrolled will 
also have ongoing medical care with a dedicated Vascular Medicine provider.   As 
api[INVESTIGATOR_9636]-approved drug commonly used for thromboprophylaxis and does 
not require routine follow-up clinical or laboratory monitoring for toxicity, the study will 
not mandate any follow-up visits or procedures other than those required for the

Ethical Considerations 
 
In this prospective, single-center randomized placebo-controlled study, we will be 
evaluating the impact of api[INVESTIGATOR_34285].  The benefits of api[INVESTIGATOR_34286].  The risk of bleeding in provoked VTE patients receiving api[INVESTIGATOR_34287].   
 
Because the proposed clinical trial involves a novel application of a U.S. FDA-
approved anticoagulant, we will obtain written consent from all study subjects and 
Institutional Review Board approval at the study site.

provoked venous thromboembolism (VTE) are suspected to be at an increased risk of recurrence. 
However, it is still unclear whether extended-duration anticoagulation is beneficial for such 
patients. The HI-
(BWH) has been designed to investigate the safety and efficacy of extended-duration low-dose 
api[INVESTIGATOR_3822] 2.5 mg twice daily for preventing recurrence in high-risk patients after initial provoked 
VTE. 
2. Specific Aims 
In this section, we provide an overview 
evidence that provoked VTE patients may require extended-duration anticoagulation for 
secondary prevention, the api[INVESTIGATOR_3822] 2.5 mg twice daily dose could be a critical addition to our 
armamentarium in those at high risk for recurrence at the transition of care from the acute to the 
chronic treatment phase.  However, this hypothesis needs to be tested in a randomized clinical 
trial.  We propose a single-center (BWH), randomized placebo-controlled trial conducted at to 
evaluate the impact of low-dose api[INVESTIGATOR_3822] (2.5 mg twice daily) in a study population exclusively 
comprised of provoked VTE patients with at least one persistent provoking factor.  We have the 
following study aims: 
Specific Aim #1: To compare the 12-month recurrent symptomatic VTE in patients with provoked 
VTE and at least one enduring factor who are randomized to either api[INVESTIGATOR_3822] (2.5 mg orally twice 
daily) as monotherapy or placebo after completing at least [ADDRESS_33838] a low risk of bleeding. 
Specific Aim #2: To compare the 12-month ISTH major bleeding in patients with provoked VTE 
and at least one enduring factor who are randomized to either api[INVESTIGATOR_3822] (2.5 mg orally twice daily) 
as monotherapy or placebo after completing at least [ADDRESS_33839] at BWH. The 
allocation ratio for the study is 1:1, meaning that half of the participants will be assigned to 
api[INVESTIGATOR_3822] 2.[ADDRESS_33840] been objectively 
confirmed with provoked DVT and/or PE, and have been treated with standard therapeutic 
anticoagulant therapy for at least three months without symptomatic recurrence. Participants must 
have at least one enduring VTE risk factor, such as obesity, heart failure, chronic lung disease, 
chronic kidney disease, pregnancy, or use of hormonal therapi[INVESTIGATOR_34304], or 
chronic inflammatory/autoimmune disorder. They must be willing to provide written informed 
consent and have outpatient follow-up at BWH. Participants who have atherosclerotic 
cardiovascular disease may also be eligible for the study, with up to 35% in each study group 
having this condition as a qualifying persistent risk factor. The study also includes individuals who 
have experienced VTE post-COVID-[ADDRESS_33841] 5 years or a contraindication to antithrombotic or antiplatelet therapy. The 
study also excludes those who require ongoing anticoagulant therapy, dual antiplatelet therapy, 
P2Y12 inhibition, or aspi[INVESTIGATOR_9601] a dose of > 81 mg daily. Other exclusion criteria include various 
medical conditions, such as severe thrombophilia, hemoglobin level < 9 mg/dL, platelet count < 
100,000/mm3, serum creatinine level > 2.5 mg/dL, ALT or AST level > 2 times the upper limit of 
the normal range, or a total bilirubin level > 1.[ADDRESS_33842] elapsed without 
taking an anticoagulant or low-dose aspi[INVESTIGATOR_34305]. The study also excludes individuals with 
a known severe thrombophilia, life expectancy < [ADDRESS_33843] a history of a severe hypersensitivity 
reaction to api[INVESTIGATOR_34306] a medication that is contraindicated to be co-administered with 
api[INVESTIGATOR_3822]. 
 
4.  Outcomes 
Both safety and efficacy will be assessed in this trial. Outcome definitions are as follows: 
4.[ADDRESS_33844] symptomatic, recurrent VTE, defined as the 
composite of fatal or nonfatal deep vein thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism within 12 months 
from randomization. The primary efficacy outcome will be independently adjudicated by a Clinical 
Events Committee (CEC) blinded to assigned treatments. DVT is diagnosed as a newly non-
compressible venous segment or segments on ultrasonography or a filling defect on computed 
tomographic (CT) venography, magnetic resonance (MR) venography, or contrast venography. 
PE is diagnosed based on new mismatched perfusion defect(s) on ventilation-perfusion scan, the 
presence of a new pulmonary artery filling defect on contrast-enhanced chest CT, a new finding 
of intraluminal filling defect on invasive pulmonary angiography, or evidence of PE at autopsy.  
Death due to causes other than DVT or PE will be considered a competing risk for this outcome. 
4.1.[ADDRESS_33845] occurrence of a composite of death due to 
cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), stroke or systemic embolism, chronic 
limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI), or coronary or peripheral ischemia requiring revascularization 
(major adverse cardiovascular events, including major adverse limb events) within 12 months, 
and the individual components of this outcome. An additional composite outcome will include all 
the components of the above composite of major adverse cardiovascular events as well as 
symptomatic VTE.  A composite thrombotic outcome will be analyzed and will include 
symptomatic VTE, fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), stroke/TIA or systemic embolism. 
The secondary efficacy outcomes will be independently adjudicated by a CEC blinded to assigned 
treatments. Non-cardiovascular death will be considered a competing risk. 
 
4.[ADDRESS_33846] major bleeding within 12 months from 
randomization.  Major bleeding is defined according to the International Society on Thrombosis 
and Haemostasis (ISTH) as overt bleeding that is associated with a decrease in the hemoglobin 
contributes to death 1.  The principal safety outcome will be independently adjudicated by a 
blinded CEC review. Non-hemorrhagic death will be considered a competing risk for this outcome. 
4.2.[ADDRESS_33847] date will be used for determining censoring.

 5. Details of Randomization and Blinding
Subjects who are 18 years of age or older with provoked DVT and/or PE, have completed at least 
[ADDRESS_33848] one 
enduring risk factor will be randomly assigned by [CONTACT_34330] a 1:[ADDRESS_33849] the ability 
to break the blind of a study patient as the need arises (immediately, in real-time).  If the Safety 
Monitor is unavailable because of travel, one of the Physician Study Investigators will serve as 
back-up.   
6. Statistical Plan 
6.1 Power Calculation 
Our power calculation accommodates efficacy outcomes. This is an implementation of the power 
calculation method described in Section 14.12 (page 807) of Rosner (2006). The equitation of 
power calculation based on 1:1 randomization is expressed as below: 
 
where   is the expected total number of events over both groups,  is the total sample size,  
and  are the probabilities of event in treatment group and placebo group over the maximum 
time of the study,  is postulated hazard ratios for the treatment over placebo.  
We postulated the following anticipated parameters for the power calculation: a) by [CONTACT_34362], the event rate of the placebo arm is 6% and there is 75% reduction rate with active 
treatment (low-intensity api[INVESTIGATOR_3822]), i.e., the event rate of the placebo arm is 1.5%; b) the 
postulated hazard ratios for the treatment over placebo by 1-year follow-up ranges from 0.2-0.24. 
These anticipated parameters are based on previous studies 3,4. In Figure 1, we provide the power 
analysis given certain sample size. The power under the significance of 0.05 is given for the total 
sample with 1:1 randomization ranging from 500-700. To achieve sufficient sample sizes needed 
for reach the power of 80%, we conservatively choose [ADDRESS_33850] ratios and with 1:1 randomization. 
The red curve indicates the power of 80%. 
6.2 Cohort Definition 
In this section, we define a main cohort and four confirmatory cohorts for the analysis of efficacy 
and safety ( Table). 
Main Cohort (ITT): we will use the intention-to-treat (ITT) cohort since it maintains the original 
randomization scheme  5.  
Confirmatory Cohort (MITT): the modified intention-to-treat (MITT) cohort consisting of all 
randomized patients who took at least one dose of the assigned treatment and did not undergo 
post-randomization exclusion. 
Confirmatory Cohort (PP-1): Additional analyses will include a per-protocol (PP) population for 
subjects who took 80% of the study drug (or placebo). 

HI-PRO Trial
ProtocolCV185-745
8 
 Confirmatory Cohort (PP-2): Additional analyses will include a per-protocol (PP) population for 
subjects who took 80% of the study drug (or placebo) with censoring for either ISTH major 
bleeding or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding event. 
Confirmatory Cohort (Safety Cohort): In this cohort, we will only consider bleeding events (major 
bleed or clinically relevant non-major bleed) that occurred within 96 hours of taking a dose of the 
study drug (or placebo). The follow-up duration will be considered until the occurrence of a 
bleeding event or [ADDRESS_33851] dose of the study drug (or placebo), whichever 
comes first.

deviation (SD) will be provided to summarize the central tendency and variability of the data. 
According to the recent statistical reporting guideline from some experts 6, we will not provide p-
values for testing the differences in baseline characteristics of the two assigned groups. However, 
the balances should be checked to see the quality of randomization by [CONTACT_34363]. We will consider the ones with a standardized difference >0.[ADDRESS_33855] provide analysis without adjustment of baseline demographics. For both the primary and 
secondary efficacy outcomes and principal and secondary safety outcomes, we use the Kaplan-
Meier curve to estimate the survival functions of each group. If there is a presence of competing 
risks, cumulative incidence functions (CIFs) will be used to estimate the survival function7. The 
two-side log-rank test is used to measure if the api[INVESTIGATOR_3822] 2.5 mg twice a day has a better survival 
chance than placebo (i.e., better chance of meeting the primary outcome). If there is a presence 
of competing risk, the log-rank based on cause-specific hazards [ADDRESS_33856] ratio of treatment in analysis with 
the adjustment of baseline demographics and its p-value implies the same conclusion as in 
analysis without adjustment of baseline demographics. However, if they are not consistent in

 clinical interpretation, i.e., a) the interpretation directions are different; b) p-values indicate 
different conclusion of significance, we will use the hazard ratio of treatment in analysis with the 
adjustment of baseline demographics as the main results to report, and the results of unadjusted 
one is treated as supplementary materials. 
 
6.4.[ADDRESS_33857] subgroup analyses based on certain predetermined factors such as 
whether the patient has PE versus non-PE, age (65 years or older versus younger), sex (male 
versus female), chronic kidney disease (defined as presence or absence of eGFR<60 
mL/min/1.72m2), atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (present versus absent), baseline low-
dose aspi[INVESTIGATOR_34308] (present versus absent), the number of provoking risk factors (2 or more versus 
less than 2), provoking factor of travel, and baseline aspi[INVESTIGATOR_34308]. The survival analysis within each 
subgroup will be repeated using the main cohort and tested in confirmatory cohorts, as needed. 
The p-value of the additive interaction effect between treatment and subgroup will be reported. 
  
In case the subgroup analysis of baseline aspi[INVESTIGATOR_34309] a relevant modification effect (the 
p-value for the additive interaction effect <0.05), the study will repeat the primary analysis by 
[CONTACT_34364][INVESTIGATOR_34310] a) the use of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_34311] b) the interaction term. 
 
6.[ADDRESS_33858] will be replaced by [CONTACT_34365]-based tests (including weighted Kaplan Meier and restricted mean survival time) 10. 
Survival analysis based on restricted mean survival time will be implemented and restricted mean 
time lost (RMTL) ratios will replace the hazard ratio for reporting. 
6.[ADDRESS_33859] a pre-specified interim analysis to assess the primary safety and efficacy 
outcomes after 50% of the planned enrollment population has completed 12-month follow-up. 
This planned interim analysis will inform the Data Safety Monitoring Board on whether the study 
should be stopped early due to efficacy, safety concerns, or futility or continue to enroll the full 
600-patient cohort. The following three elements are used in considering the interim analysis: 
6.7 Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_34302]: 
In the event that three distinct occurrences of unprovoked intracranial hemorrhages or major 
bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_34312], a thorough 
investigation will be conducted. This investigation will involve a review by [CONTACT_34366], ensuring that there have been no 
breaches of the study protocol that could have contributed to the adverse events. If the committee 
determines that these incidents are indeed linked to the api[INVESTIGATOR_34313], specific measures 
will be implemented in response to these findings. 
The decision to take action upon the confirmation of three such events is rooted in the clinical 
expertise of the researchers involved in the study. This threshold was established after extensive 
deliberation and consultation with the Mass General-Brigham Institutional Review Board (IRB). 
HI-PRO Trial
ProtocolCV185-745
11 
 The IRB is an independent body responsible for protecting the rights and welfare of human 
subjects involved in research, and their guidance plays a crucial role in maintaining the ethical 
standards of the study. 
6.8 Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_16589]: 
The futility stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_34314] a clinical trial if 
there is a high likelihood that the primary efficacy outcome rate in the placebo arm falls below 6%. 
This threshold is considered clinically safe and is set to ensure that resources are not wasted on 
a trial that is unlikely to produce meaningful results. The problem is framed as a hypothesis testing 
scenario, where the null hypothesis states that the primary efficacy rate is greater than or equal 
to 0.06, and the alternative hypothesis suggests that it is less than 0.06. 
If the null hypothesis is rejected, it indicates that the actual event rates in the placebo arm are 
less than 6%. To reject the null hypothesis, fewer than [ADDRESS_33860] be observed. In this context, 
the trial's progress will be assessed during an interim statistical analysis when the 12-month 
follow-up is completed for the 300th patient. At this point, if there are fewer than 4 events observed 
in the placebo group, the decision to terminate the trial will be considered. 
6.9 Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_34303] (superiority): 
The efficacy stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_34315] a guideline used to determine whether a clinical trial should be 
terminated early based on the observed results. This rule is applied in situations where the data 
collected from the trial's participants, in this case, 300 patients, clearly demonstrates that the 
treatment being studied has a significantly higher efficacy than the placebo. The objective is to 
avoid exposing more patients to an inferior treatment (placebo) and to expedite the process of 
bringing a highly effective treatment to the market. 
In this specific scenario, the efficacy stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_34316], which 
is a measure of the relative risk of an event occurring in the treatment group compared to the 
placebo group. A hazard ratio of less than 0.1 is considered as "overwhelmingly superior efficacy," 
indicating that the treatment group has a much lower risk of the event than the placebo group. 
To determine whether the trial should be stopped, a hypothesis test is conducted. The null 
hypothesis (H0) states that the hazard ratio is larger than or equal to 0.1, while the alternative 
hypothesis (H1) states that the hazard ratio is smaller than 0.1. If the null hypothesis is rejected 
based on the data collected from the enrolled patients, it would be concluded that the treatment 
has overwhelmingly superior efficacy compared to the placebo. As a result, the trial would be 
terminated early, allowing for a more rapid progression towards making the effective treatment 
available to patients who could benefit from it.

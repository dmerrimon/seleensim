1. INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND
[COMPANY_012] Vision recently launched a mu ltifocal contact [CONTACT_13293] , 1-DAY ACUVUE Moist 
Multifocal.  The lens is recommended for presb yopes who have -0.[ADDRESS_1074898] limited success as eviden ced by [CONTACT_781893].  To meet 
this unmet need [COMPANY_012] Vision has undertaken a toric multifocal development 
program leveraging the Moist Mu ltifocal optical design and adding toric correction and lens 
stabilization that is curren tly utilized in the 1-Day Moist for Astigmatism lens.  
A previous study  evaluati ng this novel multifocal tori c lens was completed on 
hyperopic subjects and the lens displayed acceptable clinical performance.  The population in that 
study was skewed toward the higher ADD subjects.  The purpose of this study was to evaluate the 
same design in a low ADD hyperopic population.

4. STUDY DESIGN AND RATIONALE
4.1. Description of Study Design
The study is a bilateral, single masked, single-arm, 3-visit dispensing study.  There will be one 
study treatment, with the subject being in the treatment for approximately 12-16 days. A total of 
approximately 36 eligible subjects will be targ eted to complete the study (low Add hyperopes 
only).  The subjects will be fit in the study lens and wear the study lenses for 6-[ADDRESS_1074912] Article Allocation 
This study is a single-masked (subject masked), si ngle-arm, dispensing clinical trial. Due to the 
nature of the study randomization is not required. All eligib le subjects will be assigned to wear the 
same test article according to the lens wearing schedule.  
CR-6278, v1.[ADDRESS_1074913] completed the 
study and the database is finalized. Otherwise,  the mask should be broken only if specific 
emergency treatment/course of action would be di ctated by [CONTACT_781898]. In such cases, the Inves tigator may, in an emergency, contac t the medical monitor.  In the 
event the mask is broken, the S ponsor must be informed as soon as  possible. The date, time, and 
reason for the unmasking must be documented in th e subject record. The Investigator is also 
advised not to reveal the study treatment assignmen t to the clinical site or Sponsor personnel.  
Subjects who have had their treatment assignment  unmasked are expected to return for all 
remaining scheduled evaluations.  Subjects  who are discontinued may be replaced. 
5.3. Procedures for Maintainin g and Breaking the Masking
The test articles mask shall no t be broken unless information concer ning the lens type is necessary 
for the urgent medical treatment of a subject.  The Sponsor must be notified before the mask is 
broken. 
When dispensing test articles, the following step s should be followed to maintain randomization 
codes:
1. Investigator or designee (documented on the Delegation Log) will consult the lens fitting 
schedule/randomization scheme to obtain the te st article assignment for that subject prior 
to dispensing 
2. Investigator or designee will record the s ubject’s number on the appropriate line of the 
randomization scheme 
3. Investigator or designee will pull the appropria te test articles from the study supply.  All 
test articles that are opened, whether dispense d (placed/fit on eye or dispensed outside the 
clinical site) or not, must be recorded on the Test Article Accountability Log in the 
“Dispensed” section.

In cases where a subject is lost  to follow-up, every possible effort  must be made to contact [CONTACT_781902] n/withdrawal.  The measures taken to follow 
up must be documented including two written attempts  and a certified letter (or equivalent) as the 
final attempt. 
9. PRE-STUDY AND CONCOMITANT  INTERVENTION/MEDICATION
Concomitant medications will be documented during screening and updated during the study.  
Disallowed medications and therapi[INVESTIGATOR_781883].  See the Exclusion criteria for specific details. 
10. DEVIATIONS FROM THE PROTOCOL
Investigator will notify study sponsor upon identifica tion of a protocol deviation. Major protocol 
deviations must be reported to the sponsor w ithin 24 hours after discovery of the protocol 
deviation.  The Investigat or will report deviatio ns per IRB/IEC requirements.  All deviations will 
be tracked and corrective actions implemented as appropriate. 
If it becomes necessary for the Investigator to implement a deviation in order to eliminate an 
immediate hazard to the trial subject, the Invest igator may implement the deviation immediately 
without notification to the s ponsor. Within [ADDRESS_1074926] notify and provi de the rationale to the Sponsor and, as required, the IEC/IRB.  
11. STUDY TERMINATION
The occurrence of one or more Unanticipated Serious Adverse Device Effect ([LOCATION_003]DE), or any 
SAE where the relationship to study agent cannot be ruled out, may result in stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_781884]-6278, v1.[ADDRESS_1074927](s) and will discuss this with the Investigator before any further 
subjects are enrolled.
The Sponsor will determine when a study will be stopped.  The Principal I nvestigator always has 
the discretion to initiate stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_781885]’s results are compromised.JJVC reserves the right to terminate the study  at any time for any reason.  Additionally, the 
IEC/IRB reserves the right to terminate the study if  an unreasonable risk is  determined.  The study 
can be terminated by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_781886], if in thei r opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], after a discus sion with JJVC, it is determined that it 
would be unwise to continue at the clinical site.    
JJVC (and the IEC/IRB and DMC, if applicable) will evaluate all adverse events.  If it is determined that an adverse event presents an unr easonable risk, the investig ation, or that part of 
the investigation presenting the risk, will be terminated, as soon as possible.
Should the study be terminated (either prematurely or as scheduled), the I nvestigator will notify 
the IEC/IRB and Regulatory Authority as required by [CONTACT_35512]. 
12. PROCEDURE FOR HANDLING PRODUCT QUALITY COMPLAINTS
A Product Quality Complaint (PQC) refers to any wr itten, electronic, or oral communication that 
alleges deficiencies related to the identity, qualit y, durability, reliability, safety, effectiveness or 
performance of test articles af ter they have been released for clinical trial use.  
Potential complaints may come from a variety of  sources including but not limited to subjects, 
clinical research associates (CRA), clinical operations managers (COM), medical monitors, and 
site personnel, etc. The following are not  considered product quality complaints: 
xSubject satisfaction inquiries reported via “Subjective Questionnaires” and “Patient 
Reported Outcomes (PRO)” 
xClinical test articles that are stored improperly or damaged after receipt at the 
investigational site
xLens replacements that o ccur due to drops/fall-outs
xDamage deemed by [CONTACT_781903], and 
not indicative of a quality deficien cy (i.e. tears, rips, etc.), onl y in situations where there is 
no deficiency alleged by [CONTACT_739871] [ADDRESS_1074928] be 
recorded in the EDC system, which will trigger an  automatic email notification to the appropriate 
COM/CRA and Clinical QA representative. In cases where the EDC system in use is not 
configured to send automatic notifications or when an EDC system is not used, the COM/CRA is responsible for notifying Clinical QA upon discovery that a PQC has occurred.   
CR-6278, v1.0  
Page 49 of 161JJVC Confidential
Upon receipt of the EDC notification, the COM/ CRA will contact [CONTACT_312798]:  
xDate the complaint was received/recorded  in the EDC System (Date of Sponsor 
Awareness)
xWho received the complaint 
xStudy number 
xClinical site information (contact [CONTACT_2300], site ID, telephone number)
xLot number(s) 
xUnique Subject Identifier(s)
xIndication of who first observed co mplaint (site personnel or subject)
xOD/OS indication, along with whether the lens was inserted
xAny related AE number if applicable
xDetailed complaint description (scheduled/u nscheduled visit, wear time, symptoms, 
resolution of symptoms, etc.) 
xEye Care Provider objective (sl it lamp) findings if applicable 
xConfirmation of product availability for return  (and tracking information, if available), or 
rationale if product is not available for return 
Once a complaint is received, it will be assessed by [CONTACT_19569], CRA, or trai ned site personnel to 
determine if it is an Adverse Event/Serious Adverse Event (AE/SAE).  If the complaint results in 
an AE/SAE, the COM/CRA, or trained site pers onnel will follow Section 13 of this protocol. If 
the AE/SAE was potentially the result of a produc t quality related deficiency, these procedures 
also applies and will be executed in parallel.  
In some cases, a PQC form may be generated in EDC by [CONTACT_35514].  In this event, the PQC 
forms will be marked “Intentionally Left Blank”  or “ILB”.  Justification for ILB must be 
documented. 
13. ADVERSE EVENTS
13.1. Definitions and Classifications
Adverse Event (AE) – An AE is “any untoward medical occurrence, unintended disease or 
injury, or untoward clinical signs (including abno rmal laboratory findings) in subjects, users or 
other persons, whether or not related to the investig ational medical device.  
Note 1 to entry: This definition includes  events related to the invest igational medical device or the 
comparator. 
Note 2 to entry: This definition includes even ts related to the pr ocedures involved. 
Note 3 to entry: For users or other pe rsons, this definition is restricted to events related to 
investigational medical devices.”1
CR-6278, v1.0  
Page 50 of 161JJVC Confidential
An AE includes any condition (including a pre-existing condition) that:
1. Was not present prior to the study, but appear ed or reappeared follo wing initiation of the 
study  
2. Was present prior to the study, but worsen ed during the study. This would include any 
condition resulting from concomitant illnesses,  reactions to concomitant medications, or 
progression of disease states 
3. Pregnancy must be documented as an adverse event and must be reported to the clinical 
monitor and to the Sponsor imme diately upon learning of the event 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE) – An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that: 
xResults in death

xRequires in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_781887]/incapacity (e.g., a sight threatening event, a 
significant persistent or permanent change, impairment, damage, or disruption to the 
subject’s body)
xIs a congenital anomaly/birth defect
xRequires intervention to prevent permanent damage  (the use of the test  article resulting in 
a condition which requires medical or surg ical intervention to preclude permanent 
impairment of the body structure or a body func tion).  Important medical events that may 
not result in death, be life-threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_781888], based upon appropriate  medical judgment, they ma y jeopardize the patient or 
subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to preven t one of the outcomes 
listed in the above definition
Diagnoses and conditions that are considered Oc ular Serious Adverse Events include, but not 
limited to:

xAsymptomatic Corneal Scar
xAny corneal event which necessitates te mporary lens discontinuation > 2 weeks
Non-Significant Adverse Events  – Those conditions that are usually asymptomatic and usually
do not warrant discontinuation (temporary or perman ent) of the test article.  However, the 
Investigator may choose to treat  as a precautionary measure.  
Diagnoses and conditions that are considered Ocular Non-Significan t Adverse Events  include, but 
not limited to the following: 
xNon-significant Infiltrative Event (NSIE)

13.2. Assessing Adverse Events
In conjunction with the me dical monitor, the Investigator will evaluate adverse events to ensure 
the events are categorized correctly.  Elements of categorization will include:
xSeriousness/Classifications (s ee definition in Section 13.1) 
xCausality or Relatedness – i.e. the relationship b etween the test articl e, study treatment or 
study procedures and the adverse event (not related; unlike ly related; possibly related; 
related - see definiti on in Section 13.2.1) 
xAdverse Event Severity – Adverse event severity is used to assess the degree of intensity 
of the adverse event (mild; moderate; severe for all events - see de finition in Section 0)
xOutcome – not recovered or not resolved; recov ering or resolving; recovered or resolved 
with sequelae; recovered or resolved; d eath related to a dverse event; unknown 
xActions Taken – none; temporarily disconti nued; permanently discontinued; other 
13.2.1. Causality AssessmentCausality Assessment – A determination of the relationshi p between an adverse event and the 
test article. The test article relationship for each adverse event should be determined by [CONTACT_19575]:
xNot Related- An adverse event that is not re lated to the use of the test article, study 
treatment or study procedures 
xUnlikely Related – An adverse event for which an alternative explanation is more likely, 
e.g. concomitant treatment, concomitant disease(s), or the relationsh ip of time suggests 
that a causal relationship is not likely 
xPossibly Related – An adverse event that might be due to the use of the test article, or to 
the study treatment or study procedures. An alternative explanation, e.g. concomitant 
treatment, concomitant disease(s), is inconclusi ve.  The relationship in time is reasonable.  
Therefore, the causal relationship cannot be excluded 
xRelated – An adverse event that is listed as a possible adverse effect (device) or adverse reaction (drug) and cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_1629] a lternative explanation, e.g. 
concomitant treatment of concomitant diseas e(s).  The relationship in time is very 
suggestive, e.g. it is confirmed by [INVESTIGATOR_5328]-challenge and re-challenge 
13.2.2. Severity Assessment
Severity Assessment – A qualitative assessment of the degree of intensity of an adverse event as 
determined by [CONTACT_19577]/her by [CONTACT_423].   The assessment of severity 
is made irrespective of test ar ticle, study treatment or study pro cedure relationship or seriousness 
of the event and should be evaluated according to the following scale:
xMild – Event is noticeable to the subject, but is  easily tolerated and does not interfere with 
the subject’s daily activities
xModerate – Event is bothersome, possible re quiring additional ther apy, and may interfere 
with the subject’s daily activities
xSevere – Event is intolerable, necessitates ad ditional therapy or alteration of therapy and 
interferes with the subject’s daily activities
CR-6278, v1.0  
Page 53 of 161JJVC Confidential
13.3. Documentation and Follow-Up of Adverse Events
The recording and documenting of  adverse events (ocular and non-ocular) begins when the 
subjects are exposed to the test  article, study treatment or st udy procedure.  Adverse events 
reported before the use of test article, start of study treatment, or study procedures will be 
recorded as medical history. Howe ver, if the condition deteriorates  at any time during the study it 
will be recorded and reported as an AE. Untoward medical events reported after the subject’s exit 
from the study will be recorded as adverse ev ents at the discretion of the Investigator.
Upon finding an adverse event, the Principal I nvestigator will document the condition in the 
subject record and in the eCRFs. He/she will complete the Adverse Event /eCRF.  
Complete descriptions of all adverse events must  be available in the subject record. All Adverse 
Events including local and systemic reactions not meeting the criteria for “serious adverse events” 
shall be captured on the appropriate case report form  or electronic data system. All adverse events 
occurring while the subject is enrolled in the st udy must be documented appropriately regardless 
of relationship.   
It is the Investigator’s responsibility to main tain documentation of each reported adverse event. 
All adverse events will be followed in accordan ce with applicable licensing requirements.  Such 
documentation will include the following:
xAdverse event (diagnosis not symptom) 
xDrawings or photographs (where appropriate) that detail th e finding (e.g., size, location, 
and depth, etc.)  
xDate the clinical site was notified 
xDate and time of onset
xDate and time of resolution
xAdverse event classification, severity, and re lationship to test articles, as applicable
xTreatment regimen instituted, including concomitant medications prescribed, in 
accordance with applicable licensing requirements
xAny referral to another hea lth care provider if needed
xOutcome, ocular damage (if any) 
xLikely etiology 
xBest corrected visual acuity at the discovery  of the event and upon conclusion of the event 
In addition, if an infiltrate(s) is  present, he/she will complete the Corneal Infiltrate Assessment 
eCRF.  Where necessary, a culture of the corneal lesion will be collected to determine if the 
infection is microbial in nature.  If cultures ar e collected, the date of culture collection and 
laboratory utilized will be recorded.  
Changes in the severity of an AE shall be docum ented to allow an assessment of the duration of 
the event at each level of intensity to be perfor med.  Adverse events characterized as intermittent 
require documentation of the onset  and duration of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]. Changes in the assessment of 
relationship to the Test Article shall also be clearly documented.
CR-6278, v1.[ADDRESS_1074932] return ed to pre-treatment status, stabilized, or been 
satisfactorily resolved.  If further treatment beyond licensure is required, the patient will be 
referred to the appropriate health care provider .  The Investigator w ill use his/her clinical 
judgment as to whether a subject reporting with an advers e event will continue in the study.  If a 
subject is discontinued from the study, it will be the re sponsibility of the Investigator to record the 
reason for discontinuation.  The Investigator will also document the adverse event appropriately 
and complete the Adverse Event eCRF. Any subjec ts with ongoing adverse events related to the 
test article, study treatment or study procedures, as  of the final study visit date, should be followed 
to resolution of the adverse event or until refe rral to an appropriate he alth care provider, as 
recommended by [CONTACT_737]. Non-ocular adve rse events that are not related to the test 
article, study treatment, or st udy procedures may be recorded  as “ongoing” without further 
follow-up. 
13.4. Reporting Adverse Events 
The Investigator will notify the Sponsor of an adverse event by e-mail, facsimile, or telephone as 
soon as possible and no later than 24 hours from discovery for any serious /significant adverse 
events, and [ADDRESS_1074933] igator to the IEC/IRB according to their 
requirements (Section 13.4.2).  The report will comment whether the adverse event was 
considered to be related to the test article, study treatment or study procedures. 
13.4.1. Reporting Adverse Events to SponsorSerious/Significant Adverse Events
The Investigator will inform the sponsor of a ll serious/significant adverse events occurring during 
the study period as soon as possible by e-mail,  fax, or telephone, but no later than 24 hours 
following discovery of the event.  The Investigat or is obligated to pursue and obtain information 
requested by [CONTACT_35519]. All subjects experiencing a serious/significant adverse event mu st be followed up and all outcomes must be 
reported. 
When medically necessary, the In vestigator may break the randomiz ation code to determine the 
identity of the treatment that the subject received.  The Spons or and study monitor should be 
notified prior to unmaski ng the test articles.
In the event of a serious/significant adverse event, the Investigator must:
xNotify the Sponsor immediately 
xObtain and maintain in the subject’s records all pertinent medical information and medical 
judgment for colleagues who assisted in th e treatment and follow-up of the subject 
xProvide the Sponsor with a complete case histor y which includes a statement as to whether 
the event was or was not related to the use of the test article
xNotify the IEC/IRB as required by [CONTACT_6179]/IR B reporting procedure according to national 
regulations 
CR-6278, v1.0  
Page 55 of 161JJVC Confidential
Unanticipated (Serious) Adverse Device Effect (UADE)
In the event of an Unanticipated (Serious) Adve rse Device Effect (UADE), the Investigator will 
submit a report of the UADE to the Sponsor and IE C/IRB as soon as possible,  but no later than [ADDRESS_1074934] report the results of the 
evaluation to FDA, the IEC/IRB a nd participating Investigators wi thin [ADDRESS_1074935].Non-Serious Adverse Events
All non-serious adverse events, including non-serious adverse device effects, will be reported to 
the sponsor by [CONTACT_781905] 2 days from discovery. 
13.4.2. Reporting Adverse Events to the Responsible IEC/IRB and Health Authorities
Adverse events that meet the IEC/IRB requireme nts for reporting must be reported within the 
IEC/IRB’s written guidelines. Each clinical site will refer to and follow any guidelines set forth 
by [CONTACT_19581]/IRB. Each clinical site wi ll refer to and follow any guidelines set forth by 
[CONTACT_19582].
The Sponsor will report applicable Adverse Events to the local health authorities according the 
written guidelines, including reporting timelines.  
13.4.3. Event of Special Interest
None. 
13.5. Reporting of Pregnancy
Subjects reporting pregnancy (by [CONTACT_6270]-report) duri ng the study will be discontinued after the event 
is recorded as an Adverse Event.  Once disconti nued, pregnant participants and their fetuses will 
not be monitored for study related purposes.  At the Investigator’s discretion, the study participant 
may be followed by [CONTACT_71178] . However, this data wi ll not be collected as 
part of the clinical study database.  Pregnant participants are not discontinued from contact [CONTACT_781906], but due to general c oncerns relating to pregnancy and 
contact [CONTACT_19584].  Specifically, pregnant women are discontinued due  to fluctuations in refractive 
error and/or visual acuity that occur secondary to systemic hormonal changes, and not due to 
unforeseen health risks to  the mother or fetus. 
14. STATISTICAL METHODS
14.1. General Considerations
All data summaries and statistical analyses will be performed using the SA S software Version 9.4 
or higher (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Throughout the analysis of data, the results for each 
subject/eye will be used when available for summarization and statistical analysis. Unscheduled 
visits will be summarized separately and w ill be excluded from the statistical analysis.
CR-6278, v1.0  
Page 56 of 161JJVC Confidential
Summary tables (Descriptive statistics and/or fre quency tables) will be provided for all baseline 
variables, efficacy variables and safety variables as appropriate.  Continuous variables will be 
summarized with descriptive statistics (n, mean, standard deviation (SD) , median, minimum and 
maximum). Frequency count and per centage of subjects or eyes within each cat egory will be 
provided for categ orical data. 
Summaries will be presented by [CONTACT_781907]. All analyses will be conducted on pe r-protocol population (s ee Section 14.3).   
14.2. Sample Size Justification
A total of approximately [ADDRESS_1074936] 36 
subjects will complete this study. 
Using the POWER procedure in SAS 9.4, below is th e summary of sample size required based on 
the different assumptions of the true LogMAR visual acuity and CLUE scores. The sample size 
was calculated for the non-inferi ority tests (using 0.05 as the margin) with at least 90% of 
statistical power and 2-sided type I error of 0.05. Assuming the true L ogMAR visual acuity is 
between 0.00 to 0.05 (distance) or 0.08 to 0.12 (near), and true CLUE vision score is between 38
to 42 points.

14.3. Analysis Populations
Safety Population: 
All subjects who were administered any test ar ticle excluding subjects who drop out prior to 
administering any test article. At leas t one observation shou ld be recorded.
Per-Protocol Population:  All subjects who have successfully completed all vi sits and did not substantially deviate from the 
protocol as determined by [CONTACT_35524] (Per-Protocol Population). Justificati on of excluding subjects with protocol deviations in the per-
protocol population set will be documented in a memo to file.
Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Population:
All assigned subjects regardless of actual treatment and subseque nt withdrawal from study or 
deviation from protocol. At least one observation should be recorded. 
14.4. Level of Statistical Significance
All planned analysis for this st udy will be conducted with an overa ll type I error rate of 5%.  
14.5. Primary Analysis  
LogMAR Visual Acuity
Binocular, high luminance, high contrast visual performance on logMAR scale will be analyzed 
using a linear mixed model.  Each regression m odel will include the experimental design factors: 
distance as fixed effects. Other baseline characteristics known of importance such as  age, gender, 
and/or add power will be included as fixed covariates when appropriate. Subject nested in site 
will be included as random covariates when appropriate.  The covariance between residual errors from the same subject across different charts will be selected based on th e finite-sample corrected 
Akaike’s Information Criterion.
6Covariance structures considered may include: Homogenous 
compound symmetry (CS) and Unstructured covarian ce structure (UN). The structure that returns 
the lowest Akaike Information Criteria Corrected (AICC) will be selected as the structure that 
best fit the data.
Comparisons will be carried out using 95% confidence intervals constructed of least-square 
means (LSM) from the linear mixed models. Statis tically superiority will  be concluded if the 
upper limits of the confidence intervals are be low the thresholds for corresponding distances. 
CLUE Vision Scores
CLUE vision scores will be analyzed using a linear mixed model ad justing for baseline values as 
fixed covariate. The model will include the experimental design factors: time (6-8 day or 12-16 day) as fixed effects. Other baseline characteristics known of im portance such as age, gender, 
and/or add power will be included as fixed covariates when appropriate. The covariance between residual errors from the same subject across different time will be selected based on the finite-sample corrected Akaike’s Information Criterion.
6Covariance structures considered may include: 
Homogenous compound symmetry (CS) and Unst ructured covariance structure (UN). The 
structure that returns the lowest Akaike Informat ion Criteria Corrected (AICC) will be selected as 
the structure that best fit the data.
CR-6278, v1.0  
Page 58 of 161JJVC Confidential
Comparisons will be carried out using 95% conf idence intervals constructed of least-square 
means (LSM) from the linear mixed models for each time. Statistically superiority will be 
concluded if the lower limit of the confid ence interval is greater than [ADDRESS_1074938] 
clinical trials don’t provide the evidence that subject dropout is systematic or not-at-random. To 
evaluate the impact of missing data, sensitiv ity analysis will be conducted using multiple 
imputation methods if the proportion of subject dropout is greater than the 15%. The SAS/STAT 
procedures PROC MI and PROC MIANALYZE will be utilized with a parametric regression 
method used to make at least [ADDRESS_1074939] KEEPI[INVESTIGATOR_1645]/ARCHIVING
15.1. Electronic Case Report Form/Data Collection
The data for this study will be captured on elec tronic case report forms (eCRFs) using an EDC

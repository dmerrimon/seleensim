9. SAFETY DEFINITIONS, MONITORING AND REPORTING 
9.1. Adverse Events 
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use 
of a drug in humans, whether the event is considered drug related or not. An AE can therefore 
be any unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g., an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or 
disease occurring after the subject started dosing with the study drug, without any judgment 
about causality. Any pre-existing medical condition that worsens after administration of the 
study drug/placebo nasal spraywill also be considered a new AE. 
AE collection will start following the first administration of the study drug/placebo nasal spray
until the last follow up visit of the study.
Documentation regarding the AE should be made as to the nature, date of onset, end date, 
severity, relationship to study drug, action(s) taken, seriousness, and outcome of any sign or 
symptom observed by [CONTACT_183175]. 
9.1.1. Severity 
Severity of an AE is defined as a qualitative assessment of the degree of intensity of an AE as 
determined by [CONTACT_19577]/her by [CONTACT_102]/subject. The assessment of 
severity is made irrespective of relationship to study drug or seriousness of the event and should 
be evaluated according to the following scale: 
 Mild:  Event is noticeable to the subject but is easily tolerated and does not interfere 
with the subject’s daily activities.
 Moderate :  Event is bothersome, possibly requiring additional therapy, and may 
interfere with the subject’s daily activities.
Severe: Event is intolerable, necessitates additional therapy or alteration of 
therapy, and interferes with the subject’s daily activities.
9.1.2. Relationship to Study Drug
The relationship of each AE to the investigational product should be determined by [CONTACT_3786](in a blinded manner) using these explanations:
Definite: When there are good reason and sufficient documentation to demonstrate 
a direct causal relationship between investigational product and AE

OC-01 (varenicline) Nasal Spray Sponsor: Oyster Point Pharma, Inc. 
Clinical Trial Protocol # OPP-102 10 Nov2022 
Amendment No. 7 
 
Confidential   29  Probable: When there are good reasons and sufficient documentation to assume a 
causal relationship in the sense of plausible, conceivable, likely but not necessarily 
highly probable 
 Possible: When there is sufficient information to accept the possibility of a causal 
relationship in the sense of not impossible and not unlikely, although the connection 
is uncertain or doubtful, for example, due to missing data or insufficient evidence.
 None: When there is sufficient information to accept a lack of a causal relationship, 
in the sense of impossible and improbable . 
 Unclassified: When the causal relationship is not assessable for whatever reason due 
to insufficient evidence, conflicting data, or poor documentation.  
9.1.3. Expectedness 
The expectedness of an AE should be determined based upon existing safety information about 
the study drug using these explanations: 
 Unexpected:  An AE that is not listed in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) or is not 
listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed . 
 Expected: An AE that is listed in the IB at the specificity and severity that has been 
observed.  
 Not Applicable: Any AE that is unrelated to the study drug. 
AEs that are mentioned in the IB as occurring with a class of drugs or as anticipated from the 
pharmacological properties of the drug but are not specifically mentioned as occurring with the 
drug under investigation are to be considered unexpected. 
The Investigator should initially classify the expectedness of an AE, but the final classification 
is subject to the Medical Monitor’s determination. 
9.2. Serious Adverse Events 
An AE is considered a serious adverse event (SAE) if, in the view of either the Investigator or 
Sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: 
 Death 
 A life-threatening AE
Note: An AE is considered “life-threatening” if, in the view of either the Investigator or 
Sponsor, its occurrence places the patient or subject at immediate risk of death. It does not 
include an AE that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death. 
 Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_163506]: The term “inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” refers to any inpatient admission (even if less than 24 
hours). For chronic or long-term inpatients, inpatient admission includes transfer within the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4591]/intensive care inpatient unit. Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_183159]; outpatient/same day/ambulatory procedures; observation/short stay 
OC-01 (varenicline) Nasal Spray Sponsor: Oyster Point Pharma, Inc. 
Clinical Trial Protocol # OPP-102 10 Nov2022 
Amendment No. 7 
 
Confidential   30  units; rehabilitation facilities; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4593]; nursing homes; or clinical research/phase 1 
units.
Note: The term “prolongation of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” refers to any extension of an inpatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_183160]. 
Note: Planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_183161] (e.g., surgery was performed 
earlier than planned). 
 A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions. 
Note: An SAE specifically related to visual threat would be interpreted as any potential 
impairment or damage to the subject’s eyes (e.g., hemorrhage, retinal detachment, central 
corneal ulcer, or damage to the optic nerve). 
 A congenital anomaly/birth defect in an offspring of a study subject. 
Important medical events that may not result in death, are life-threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical judgment, 
they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  
SAEs are collected at the time the subject signs the Informed Consent Form until the last follow 
up visit of the study.  
9.3. Procedures for Reporting Adverse Events  
All AEs and their outcomes must be reported to the Sponsor, and the IRB/IEC as required by 
[CONTACT_1201]/IEC, federal, state, or local regulations and governing health authorities and recorded 
on the appropriate eCRF.
9.3.1. Reporting a Suspected Unexpected Adverse Reaction 
All AEs that are ‘suspected’ and ‘unexpected’ are to be reported to the Sponsor and the 
IRB/IEC as required by [CONTACT_1201]/IEC, federal, state, or local regulations and governing health 
authorities. 
9.3.2. Reporting a Serious Adverse Event
To ensure subject safety, all SAEs, regardless of relationship to the study drug, must be 
reported within 24 hours of the Investigator’s knowledge. All information relevant to the SAE 
must be recorded on the appropriate CRFs. The Investigator is obligated to pursue and obtain 
information requested by [CONTACT_183176]. All 
subjects experiencing a SAE must be followed up and the outcome reported. 
In the event of a SAE, the Investigator must obtain and maintain in his/her files all pertinent 
medical records, information, and medical judgments from colleagues who assisted in the 
treatment and follow-up of the subject; provide the Sponsor with a complete case history, which 
OC-01 (varenicline) Nasal Spray Sponsor: Oyster Point Pharma, Inc.  
Clinical Trial Protocol # OPP-102 10 Nov2022 
Amendment No. 7 
 
Confidential   31  includes a statement as to whether the event was or was not suspected to be related to the use of 
the study drug; and inform the IRB of the SAE within their guidelines for reporting SAEs. 
An SAE will be reported through the electronic data capture (EDC)system.  If the EDC system 
is unavailable to the site staff to report the serious adverse event, the information is to be 
reported to the sponsor via the SAE Form and submitted to [EMAIL_3592] .  The 
data must be entered into the EDC system when the system is again available.  If requested, 
medical records may be provided at [EMAIL_3592] . 
9.4. Procedures for Unmasking of Study Drug
All subjects, investigators, and study personnel involved with the conduct of the study will be 
masked with regards to treatment assignments. When medically necessary, the Investigator may 
need to determine what treatment regimen has been assigned to a subject. When possible (i.e., 
in non-emergent situations), the Sponsor should be notified before unmasking study drug. 
Unmasking will be performed utilizing the randomization system. The unmasked subject will 
continue the study if warranted by [CONTACT_183177].  
9.5. Type and Duration of the Follow-up of Subjects after Adverse 
Events 
The Investigator will follow unresolved AEs to resolution until the subject is lost to follow-up 
or until the AE is otherwise classified. Resolution means the subject has returned to baseline 
state of health or the Investigator does not expect any further improvement or worsening of the 
AE. If the patient is lost to follow-up, the Investigator should make [ADDRESS_216428]’s source document. Non-serious AEs identified on the last scheduled contact [CONTACT_183178].  
New information relating to a previously reported serious adverse event must be submitted.  All 
new information for serious adverse events must be submitted within 24 hours following the 
investigator’s knowledge of new information.  The investigator may be asked to provide 
additional follow-up information, which may include discharge summary or extracts from the 
medical record.  
10. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS

10.2. Analysis Populations 
 
 
 
10.2.2. Per Protocol 
The per-protocol (PP) population will include all ITT subjects with baseline corneal fluorescein 
 in subjects with Stage I (corneal epi[INVESTIGATOR_126308]/punctate keratopathy) NK in 
one or both eyes.  Analysis using the PP population will group subjects according to the 
treatment to which they were randomized.
10.2.3. Safety Population
The safety population will include all randomized subjects who received at least one dose of the 
study drug. Analysis on the safety population will group subjects according to the treatment 
received.  
10.3. Statistical Hypotheses 
Let µh, and µ pdenote the mean change in corneal fluorescein staining from baseline to Week 8 
(1.2 mg/mL OC-01 and placebo, respectively) in subjects with Stage 1 NK
H0: µh -µp= 0
H1: µh -µp
10.4. Sample Size and Power Considerations
 
 
10.5. Statistical Analysis 
This section briefly outlines the planned efficacy analyses. The statistical analysis plan (SAP) 
describes the methods to be used in detail. If the SAP and the protocol disagree, the details and 
methods of the SAP will prevail. 
10.5.1. Randomization and Stratification 
Subjects will be randomized 1:1 to receive either OC-01 nasal spray or vehicle control. 
The randomization will be stratified by:  
[CONTACT_183172]-procedure (Baseline) non-anesthetized Schirmer’s score (<5, >5) measured at 
the screening/randomization visit  

OC-01 (varenicline) Nasal Spray Sponsor: Oyster Point Pharma, Inc. 
Clinical Trial Protocol # OPP-[ADDRESS_216429] will be created using block randomization. Sites will be assigned 
entire blocks as needed. 
10.5.2. General Considerations
Quantitative variables will be summarized using the number of subjects (n), mean, SD, median, 
25th and 75th percentiles, and minimum and maximum. Qualitative variables will be 
summarized using counts and percentages. 
All summaries will be presented by [CONTACT_1570]. Summaries will be provided for 
demographics, medical history, concomitant medications, and subject disposition. 
For the summaries, medical history, concomitant medications, and AEs will be coded to the 
Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA)and World Health Organization Drug 
dictionaries, as appropriate. 
Baseline measures are defined as the last measure prior to the initiation of study treatment, 
usually at Visit [ADDRESS_216430] Demographics and Baseline Characteristics 
Continuous summary statistics will be generated for age in years by [CONTACT_183179]. Discrete summary statistics will be generated for the following qualitative 
demographic variables: age category, gender, ethnicity, race, and other baseline intranasal 
examination results, tabulated by [CONTACT_183180]. Individual subject data 
listings will support the summary tables.
10.5.5. Primary Efficacy Analysis
The primary efficacy endpoint will be analyzed on the  
comparing the treatment group to placebo with the randomization strata, 
Baseline Schirmer’s Test Score as the covariate and Mackie Classification Stage as an 
independent variable.   The primary endpoint will be the mean change from baseline in corneal 
fluorescein staining at Week 8.  The analysis using the PP population will be treated as the 
primary analysis.   
10.5.6. Secondary Efficacy Analysis 
The secondary efficacy endpoints are as follows:
 Mean change from baseline in visual acuity at Week 8

Confidential   34  The secondary efficacy endpoint will be analyzed on the PP population using an analysis of 
covariance model comparing the treatment group to placebo with randomization strata, baseline 
Schirmer’s Test Score and the baseline ETDRS visual acuity as covariates.   
10.5.7. Safety Analysis 
All safety analyses will be performed on the safety population. 
The safety of OC-01 (varenicline) will be assessed primarily by [CONTACT_51253]. An AE 
will be considered a treatment-emergent AE (TEAE) if it occurs or worsens on or after 
initiation of treatment. An overall summary of TEAEs will be presented including the number 
of events and the number of subjects with events (along with percentages) by [CONTACT_183181], relationship to treatment, and severity. 
Other safety endpoints including visual acuity, slitlamp bio microscopy and intranasal 
examination will be summarized by [CONTACT_72082]. 
Changes or shifts from baseline will be summarized where appropriate. For assessments 
performed by [CONTACT_72067], study eye and fellow eye will be summarized separately.  
The SAP will present methods of analysis of these defined parameters in detail.
10.5.8. Interim Analysis
No interim analysis is planned for this study.

Clinical Trial Protocol # OPP-[ADDRESS_216432] PROCEDURE DEVELOPED FOR THE EARLY 
TREATMENT DIABETIC RETINOPATHY STUDY (ETDRS)  
Visual Acuity Equipment and Facilities:  
The procedure described in this section utilizes the following equipment:  
 Set of three ETDRS Distance Visual Acuity Test charts which are modified 
ETDRS Charts 1, [ADDRESS_216433] is seated (see 
below) 
Visual Acuity Charts  
Charts [ADDRESS_216434] Sloan Letters in each of 14 lines, lines of equal difficulty, and a geometric 
progression of letter size (and, thus, an arithmetic progression of the logarithm of minimum 
angle of resolution) from line to line.  Charts 1, 2, and R have different letter sequences.  
Subjects should be prevented from seeing Charts [ADDRESS_216435] begins.
Visual Acuity Box  
The dimensions of the light box are 24 ¾ inches by 7 inches. The box can be mounted on a 
wall or on a cylindrical stand. The stand is mounted on a five-pronged wheelbase, with each 
prong about 14 inches long; two of the five wheels are lockable. When the box is mounted on 
the stand, its height can be varied.
The light box should be mounted at a height such that the top of the third row of letters (0.8 log 
MAR) is 49 (2 inches +/-) from the floor. The rear of the box provides storage space for the 
two charts not being used.
Illumination  
Most of the room lights should be turned off during the visual acuity test.  The box itself 
provides sufficient illumination for the examiner to record the test results.  Additional light

 [CONTACT_183185] “on” for about 4 days ([ADDRESS_216437] to be 
continuous). A note should be kept on the back of the light box, indicating the date 
and time when new tubes were replaced.
 No testing will be done with the light box during the initial 4-day period.
 All tubes should be replaced once a year. 
Each tube is partly covered by a 14-inch fenestrated sleeve, open in the back, which serves as 
a baffle to reduce illumination.  Each sleeve should be centered on the tube such that an equal 
length of tube (4 3/16 inches) is left uncovered to the right and left of the sleeve.  The 
openings in the backs of the sleeves should be oriented to point directly toward the back of 
the box (i.e., the sleeves should not be tilted up or down).  Also, the lower sleeve has a cutout 
that should point toward the ballast. 
4- and 1- Meter Visual Acuity Lanes 
A distance of exactly 4 meters (13 feet and 1 1/2 inches, or 157.5 inches) is required between 
the subject’s eyes and the visual acuity chart for the 4-meter test, and a distance of exactly 1 
meter (39 and 3/8 inches) is required for the 1-meter test. 
The room for visual acuity testing must have, in addition to the 4-meter lane, space for the 
visual acuity box (and possibly a stand) and space for the seated subject.  Minimum room-
length requirements vary according to how the box is mounted: 
 Wall-mounted box: In addition to the 4-meter lane, [ADDRESS_216438].
Stand-mounted box: In addition to the 4-meter lane, [ADDRESS_216439] be allowed for 
two of the stand’s casters to touch the rear wall (or a line marked on the floor 
when there is no wall) plus space for the seated subject. 
Marking the Distance 
[ADDRESS_216440]’s eye from the chart must be marked clearly and permanently.  
OC-01 (varenicline) Nasal Spray Sponsor: Oyster Point Pharma, Inc. 
Clinical Trial Protocol # OPP-[ADDRESS_216441].  Corrected aphakic patients, 
including those with intraocular lenses, should undergo subjective refraction as specified 
below. For uncorrected aphakic patients, a [PHONE_3925]-dioptersphere should be added to the trial 
frame as the beginning approximate refraction.
The beginning approximate refraction is the result of the subjective refraction on the previous 
visit.
At Visit 1, if the visual acuity is 20/100 (2/10)or better, and the subject does not wear glasses 
for distance, the beginning approximate refraction is plano.
If he or she does wear glasses for distance, the beginning approximate refraction is the 
measured power of those glasses (using a lensometer).
Before the subjective refraction, visual acuity is measured using the beginning approximate 
refraction and Chart R.
OC-01 (varenicline) Nasal Spray Sponsor: Oyster Point Pharma, Inc. 
Clinical Trial Protocol # OPP-[ADDRESS_216442]’s visual acuity is <20/200 (2/20) in either eye with the subject’s present distance 
glasses (or without correction, if the subject does not have glasses), retinoscopy should be 
performed by [CONTACT_183186].
An acceptable alternative is to use an automated refractor.  The refraction steps below are 
recommended for visual acuities of 20/20 through 20/80 with the beginning approximate 
refraction.  For visual acuities worse than 20/80, refer to the refraction table for the 
appropriate sphere and cylinder powers and testing distance (see Table 2) and follow a similar 
procedure using steps in power that are equal to the power of the lens being presented. 
NOTE: Whenever the visual acuity improves to a higher range by [CONTACT_183187], for 
example, from the 20/80 to 20/160 range to the 20/20 to 20/80 range, refinement should be 
performed with the smaller sphere and cylinder powers given for the better visual acuity.

occluded (by [CONTACT_183188]) and the beginning 
approximate refraction, as determined above, is placed in the right lens cells with the 
cylindrical correction anterior. Chart R should be read at a distance of 4 meters.
Determination of Spherical Refraction  
The visual acuity of the right eye is assessed and noted. A +0.[ADDRESS_216445] is asked if the vision is “better,” “worse,” or “no different” while 
he or she is looking at the smallest line read well.
 If vision is improved, the subject is requested to read the chart and if at least one 
more letter is read, the sphere in the trial frame is replaced by a sphere that is 0.25 
diopter less plus.  If vision is improved or there is no change, the sphere in the 
frame is replaced with one that is one-half diopter more plus.  The +0.[ADDRESS_216446] is asked again if the vision is 
“better”, “worse” or “no different”.  This process of increasing the plus sphere in 
the trial frame is repeated until the subject says that the +0.50-sphere held in front 
of the trial frame makes the vision worse.  When the subject responds that the 
vision is made “worse”, the lens should be left in place for [ADDRESS_216447] is accommodating (an unlikely situation in a 
population over age 60).  If the vision clears during this period, the +0.50 sphere 
may be added again and succeeding attempts to evaluate additional plus lenses 
should be accompanied with a 10 to 15 second delay.  Ifthere is no evidence of 
unrelaxed accommodation, the delay period while assessing plus lenses is not 
necessary at any time further in the examination.
OC-01 (varenicline) Nasal Spray Sponsor: Oyster Point Pharma, Inc.  
Clinical Trial Protocol # OPP-[ADDRESS_216448] says that the vision is “worse” and remains worse, the +0.[ADDRESS_216449]’s vision is determined.  After determining this highest-plus or least–minus sphere, the 
subject is asked to read the smallest line possible.
Next, a –0.[ADDRESS_216450] is asked if the vision is 
“better”, “worse”, or “no different”.
 If vision is improved, the subject is requested to read the chart and if at least one 
more letter is read, the sphere in the trial frame is replaced by a sphere that is 0.[ADDRESS_216451] 
reads fewer letters but states that the acuity is better.  There is a general attempt in 
this refraction protocol to avoid “over-minusing” the subjects. However, when 
plus cylinders are in the refraction, one must be careful not to unnecessarily 
withhold minus which may be necessary for the subject to accept the needed plus 
cylinders later in the refraction.  Minus spherical power is added in –0.[ADDRESS_216452] shows no further improvement in vision.  If minus 
power is added, a +0.[ADDRESS_216453] says the vision is “no different” or “worse”, no minus power should 
be added, and the spherical determinations are completed.
Determination of Cylindrical Refraction  
For purposes of this discussion only plus cylinder techniques are presented. 
Cylinder axis determination
If the approximate refraction contains a cylinder correction, changes in cylindrical axis are 
tested by [CONTACT_1583] a 0.25, 0.37, or 0.[ADDRESS_216454] the position producing “less blur” while fixating on a single round letter 
on the line above the lowest line on the chart he or she is able to read when the cross-cylinder 
is not held up before the trial frame.  If the subject cannot choose between the two positions 
of the cross cylinder at the beginning of this test, the axis of the cylinder is moved 5 to 15 
OC-01 (varenicline) Nasal Spray Sponsor: Oyster Point Pharma, Inc.  
Clinical Trial Protocol # OPP-[ADDRESS_216455] the positive axis of the cross-cylinder when it is 
in the position found to be less. 
(When the power of the cylinder is low or if the subject’s discrimination is poor; larger shifts 
will produce more clear-cut answers.) The cross-cylinder is tried again with the positive axis 
[ADDRESS_216456] prefers the position axis coincident with the cylinder axis, the power of 
the correcting plus cylinder is increased by [CONTACT_33018] +0.[ADDRESS_216457] finds neither 
position definitely better than the other.  As plus cylinders are added, the examiner should 
recognize that the spherical equivalent of the refraction is being changed.  More minus 
spheres may be needed as plus cylinders are added. When using plus cylinders for every 0.50 
diopter of cylinder power added, the sphere should be changed by –0.25 diopter.  If, at any 
time, the preference with the cross-cylinder indicates that cylinder power should be removed 
entirely, the 0.25 cylinder should be rotated 90 degrees from its original position.  The axis 
should be refined, and the power should be tested again. If the beginning refraction is a 
“pure” sphere, the presence of astigmatism is tested by [CONTACT_183189] a +0.[ADDRESS_216458] 
prefers to remove the +0.25, it should be removed and the final refraction is then purely 
spherical. An example of this procedure follows:

Amendment No. 7 
Confidential 50
 
 
 
 Beginning refraction: -2.50 + 0.[ADDRESS_216459] the change in sign (+ or -). 
When using minus cylinder correcting lenses, the preferred orientation of the cross cylinder is 
determined in the same way as when using plus cylinder lenses.  When determining cylinder 
axis however, the correcting minus cylinder axis is rotated toward the minus cylinder axis of 
the cross cylinder (not the cylinder axis as it is when a plus cylinder correcting lens is used).  
When determining cylinder power, the correcting minus cylinder power is increased when, in 
the preferred orientation, the minus axis of the cross cylinder coincides with the minus 
cylinder axis of the correcting lens.  
Refining Final of Spherical Power  
When neither the power nor the axis of the cylinder can be improved, the power of the sphere 
is refined by [CONTACT_183190] +0.25 sphere and –0.37 sphere and changing the spherical power 
(see below). If the sphere is changed at this point, the cylinder should be rechecked. This 
process is repeated until no further significant lens changes are made.
This refraction protocol can be summarized as follows: First, having eliminated any possible 
accommodation with plus spheres, the best spherical equivalent power is found, which places 
the circle of least confusion on the retina. Then the cylinder power and cylinder axis are 
assessed. This process of checking sphere, cylinder axis, and cylinder power is repeated until 
there are no changes that result in an increased number of letters being read. Ideally, at the 
end of the refraction, the sphere is checked and the subject neither tolerates increased plus nor 
improves with increased minus spheres. Then the axis is checked and no change in axis is 
indicated. Finally, the cylindrical power is checked and no change in this is indicated. At this 
point, the refraction is completed. Sometimes this endpoint cannot be reached because there is 
an unending number of small corrections at each repetition of the process. When it becomes 
clear that these small changes are not resulting in an increased number of letters read 
correctly, the examiner may terminate the refraction.
The lens corrections obtained in this way for the right eye are recorded on the BCdVA 
Assessment Form as the corrections obtained by [CONTACT_183191]. The 
OC-01 (varenicline) Nasal Spray Sponsor: Oyster Point Pharma, Inc. 
Clinical Trial Protocol # OPP-[ADDRESS_216460] on the refraction chart at this distance, 
the refraction should be attempted at 1 meter. If the subjective refraction can be performed 
successfully at 1 meter, a +0.75 sphere should be subtracted from the results of the 1- meter 
refraction to make the correction appropriate for the 4-meter distance. This correction should 
be entered on the BCdVA Assessment Form in the space provided for distance subjective 
refraction. (NOTE: Visual acuity will be tested first at the 4-meter distance even if the subject 
cannot be refracted at this distance. If the patient reads less than [ADDRESS_216461] also be tested at 1 meter, in which case the +0.75 sphere should be 
added to the 4-meter refraction.) 
Testing Best Corrected Visual Acuity  
4-Meter Test
Testing of all eyes begins at [ADDRESS_216462]’s eyes to the visual acuity chart must be exactly 4 meters (13 
feet and 1 ½ inches, or 157.5 inches).  The subject must sit for the 4-meter visual acuity test. 
As indicated previously, the subject should be seated comfortably with his or her back firmly 
placed against the back of the chair.  The examiner should ensure that the subject is seated 
comfortably, that the head does not move forward or backward during the test, and that the 
subject’s eyes remain at the 4- meter distance.
The testing procedure for visual acuity is based on the principle that the objective is to test 
visual acuity and not intelligence or the ability to concentrate or follow or remember 
instructions (although all of these factors are involved).  The subject should be told that the 
chart has five letters in each line, and has letters only and no numbers.  If the subject forgets 
this instruction and reads a number, he or she should be reminded that the chart contains no 
numbers and the examiner should request a letter in lieu of the number. 
The subject should be asked to read slowly (at a rate not faster than about one letter per 
second) to achieve the best identification ofeach letter and to not proceed until they have 
given a definite response.  It may be useful for the examiner to demonstrate the letter-a-
second place by [CONTACT_183192] “A, B, C,…”.  If, at any point, the subject reads too quickly, he or 
she should be asked to stop and read slowly.  If the subject loses his or her place in reading or 
the examiner loses his or her place (possibly because the letters are read too quickly), the 
OC-01 (varenicline) Nasal Spray Sponsor: Oyster Point Pharma, Inc. 
Clinical Trial Protocol # OPP-[ADDRESS_216463]; instead, a sheet of white paper may be used to guide the subject to the proper location on 
the chart.  Each letter is scored as right or wrong (see below).  Once a subject has identified a 
letter with a definite single-letter response and has read the next letter, a correction of the 
previous letter cannot be accepted.  If the subject changes a response aloud (e.g., That was a 
“C”, not an “O”) before heor she has read aloud the next letter then the change should be 
accepted.  If the subject changes a response after beginning to read the next letter, the change 
is not accepted.
When the subject says he or she cannot read a letter, he or she should be encouraged to guess. 
If the subject identifies a letter as one of two or more letters, he or she should be asked to 
choose one letter and if necessary, to guess even if the next letter has already been read. The 
examiner may suggest that the subject turn his or her head or eye in any manner if this 
improves visual acuity.  If the subject does this, care must be taken to ensure that the fellow 
eye remains covered.  If testing the right eye, the left eye must be occluded by [CONTACT_183193] a folded tissue with tape.  The subject should be encouraged to 
read as many letters as possible. 
There are several reasons for encouraging subjects to guess:
 Subject’s statements that they cannot identify a letter are often unreliable.
 Encouraging them to guess helps to maximize the subject’s effort. 
 It helps to assure uniformity among procedures performed in different clinics.
 It may help to prevent subject bias (malingering).
1-Meter Test 
At [ADDRESS_216464] distance from 
4 meters to 1 meter, the testing chart (Chart 1 and 2) should first be removed from view to 
prevent the subject from reading the chart with the fellow eye.
Before testing at 1 meter, a +0.75 sphere should be added to the 4-meter correction already in 
the trial frame to compensate for the closer testing distance. (As previously indicated, the 
subject should be seated comfortably with his or her back firmly placed against the back of 
the chair).  The distance of [ADDRESS_216465] is repeated for the left eye, starting at 4 meters.  
OC-01 (varenicline) Nasal Spray Sponsor: Oyster Point Pharma, Inc. 
Clinical Trial Protocol # OPP-[ADDRESS_216466]-Corrected Visual Acuity
On the BCDVA Assessment Form, the total number of letters read correctly in each row of 
letters should be written down.  Visual acuity will be measured once for each eye, using Chart 
1 for the right eye, Chart 2 for the left eye, and Chart 1 for binocular vision testing.  After 
each measurement of visual acuity, the visual score for the visit is calculated. The visual 
acuity score is defined as follows:
 If [ADDRESS_216467] distance, the visual 
acuity score is equal to the numbers of letters read correctly at 4 meters, plus 30; 
or 
 If less than [ADDRESS_216468] distance, the visual 
acuity score is equal to the number of letters read correctly at 1 meter plus the 
number at 4 meters: or  
 If no letters are read correctly at either the 4-meter distance or the 1-meter 
distance, the visual acuity score is 0.  
Count Fingers Visual Acuity  
If visual acuity is so poor that the subject cannot read any of the largest letters at 1 meter (i.e. 
number of letters read correctly at 1 meter is zero), count fingers vision (CF), the examiner’s 
hand holding 1, 2, or [ADDRESS_216469] be occluded by [CONTACT_183194] a folded tissue with tape.  A light should be shone directly on the hand 
from behind the patient.  The examiner’s fingers should be presented in random order and 
repeated [ADDRESS_216470] correctly 
identifies three of the five presentations, then count fingers (CF) is noted as “yes.”  If not, the 
subject should be tested for hand motion vision.
Hand Motion Visual Acuity  
The examiner’s hand with all fingers spread out should be extended two feet directly in front 
of the eye being examined.  The fellow eye should be occluded.  Iftesting the right eye, the 
left eye must be occluded by [CONTACT_183195] a folded tissue with tape. A 
light should be shone directly on the hand from behind the subject.  The examiner’s hand 
should be moved in an up and down direction (vertically) or in a side-to-side direction 
(horizontally) at a constant speed of approximately one back and forth presentation per 
OC-01 (varenicline) Nasal Spray Sponsor: Oyster Point Pharma, Inc. 
Clinical Trial Protocol # OPP-[ADDRESS_216471] is instructed that the examiner’s hand will be presented, and they will 
have to respond to the question: “What am I doing with my hand?”  This should be repeated 
five times. Four out of five correct responses indicate that hand motion vision is present.  If 
the subject does not correctly identify four of five, then light perception must be tested. 
Light Perception and No Light Perception
Light perception should be tested with an indirect ophthalmoscope in a darkened room.  The 
fellow eye should be well occluded, ideally with a taped tissue behind the trial frame as well 
as the occlude lens in the trial frame.  The indirect ophthalmoscope light should be in focus at

recorded as “no light perception.” 
When examiners conclude that the final visual acuity score is totally unreliable because of the 
subject’s decreased mental ability, the visual acuity score must still be entered on the 
appropriate form.  
In order to provide standardized and well-controlled assessments of visual acuity during the 
study, all visual acuity assessments at a single site must be consistently done using the same 
lighting conditions and same correction if possible, during the entire study. If the same 
correction cannot be used (i.e., a subject broke his/her glasses), the reason for the change in 
correction should be documented.

Intranasal Examination 
Qualified subjects for the study must undergo an intranasal exam to make the final eligibility 
determination (e.g., severe nasal airway obstruction such as, severe septal deviation or 
inferior turbinate hypertrophy, or vascularized polyp seen on examination are reasons for 
exclusion). To monitor nasal mucosal integrity during the study for subject safety, an 
examination of the nasal cavities via an intranasal exam will be performed at Visit 1 (after all 
other screening procedures have been completed). This examination will be performed by [CONTACT_183196] (ENT) specialist, otolaryngologist or other suitably qualified medical

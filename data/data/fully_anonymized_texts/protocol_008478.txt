6 Introduction
6.1 Rheumatoid Arthritis 
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory and joint degenerative 
disease that affects almost 1% of the adult population worldwide, with onset classically between the ages of 30 and 50, and a higher prevalence in women. The disease is characterized by [CONTACT_77368], stiffness, and restricted mobility due to a persistent symmetrical inflammation of the synovial membrane of multiple joints that ultimately results in irreversible damage of the joint cartilage and bone.
1,2,3
Devel opment of the disease involves an inflammatory response of the synovial 
membrane that is accompanied by [CONTACT_366140] a variety of immune cells, which leads to the build-up and maintenance of a cytokine network. One of the cytokines central to this network is tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), as is clearly demonstrated by [CONTACT_427231]-α blockers in treating RA. TNF-α and other proinflammatory 
cytokines contribute to cartilage and bone erosion by [CONTACT_427232] κ B Ligand, which triggers differentiation of hematopoietic 
cells into bone resorbing osteoclasts. When left untreated, the disease leads to significant disability associated with high economic costs.
In recent years, the therapeutic management of subjects with RA has seen a major 
revolution. A considerable advance in the treatment of RA came from the introduction of the biological therapeutics like etanercept, infliximab, adalimumab or more recently, certolizumab pegol, which neutralize TNF-α. Spurred by [CONTACT_366143], more 
biologicals aimed at targeting other molecules involved in RA pathology are being developed. An anti-CD20 antibody (rituximab) directed at depleting B cells, a fusion protein targeting T-cell co-stimulation (abatacept), and tocilizumab, targeting the interleukin (IL)-[ADDRESS_539943] all recently been approved for the treatment of RA.

Despi [INVESTIGATOR_95053] a need still exists for less expensive and orally active drugs. 
Hence, various companies are pursuing the development of small-molecule inhibitors, including janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors.
In November 2012, tofacitinib (Xeljanz
) became the first JAK inhibitor to receive Food 
and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for the treatment of adult patients with RA. 
Tofacitinib is a small molecule suitable for oral administration, has strong binding affinity for JAK1 and JAK3, and weaker affinity for JAK2. The extensive pre-clinical and phase 1, 2, and 3 clinical development programs demonstrated its mechanisms of action via anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects. The drug proved to be efficacious in treating the signs and symptoms of RA and was well tolerated. Overall, the side-effects and risk profiles of tofacitinib are similar to those of several conventional antirheumatic agents with cytopenias, elevated levels of liver function enzymes, increased level of low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol
5, and a small 
increased risk for infections including serious and opportunistic infections seen during the studies. Baricitinib, a molecule with strong binding affinity for JAK1 and 2, has been through extensive phase [ADDRESS_539944] profile. 
6.2 Background on Filgotinib JAKs are intracellular cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases (TYKs) that transduce cytokine 
signaling from membrane receptors to the nucleus of cells. JAK inhibitors block the signaling of various cytokines, growth factors and hormones, including the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6. Four different types of JAKs are known which (co-)interact with different sets of membrane receptors: JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 and TYK2. Inhibition of JAKs is a promising therapeutic option for a range of inflammatory conditions including RA and Crohn’s disease (CD).
GLPG0634, now referred to as filgotinib (GS-6034) is a potent and selective inhibitor of 
JAK1 and is being co-developed by [CONTACT_427233], Inc. ([COMPANY_009]). The compound is currently in phase 3 development for RA and CD and has shown good preliminary efficacy in RA patients. The anticipated therapeutic daily dose range is 100 to 200 mg.
Filgotinib is metabolized to form one major active metabolite, GS-829845 
(formerly G254445). Though the potency of this metabolite is lower than the parent molecule, the overall exposure and peak plasma concentration in humans is higher. As a consequence, dedicated pharmacology and toxicology studies have been performed with GS-829845. Results from pharmacodynamics (PD) testing in healthy volunteers suggest that the clinical activity of filgotinib could result from the combination of the parent molecule and the metabolite.
More information on the study medication along with references to support the cited data 
is presented in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB).

6.3 Background - Pre-clinical Studies
6.3.1 Physical, Chemical and Pharmaceutical Properties and Formulations
The chemical name [CONTACT_427255] (HCl) trihydrate or GS-6034-01 is 
N-(5-(4-((1,1-dioxidothiomorpholin-4-yl)methyl)phenyl)-[1,2,4]triazole[1,5-a]pyridin-2-yl)cyclopropanecarboxamide hydrochloride trihydrate.
The chemical name [CONTACT_427256]-6034-02 is 
N-(5-{4-[(1,1-dioxidothiomorpholin-4-yl) methyl]phenyl}[1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyridin-2-yl) cyclopropanecarboxamide (2Z)-but-2-enedioate.
Two clinical tablet formulations are currently available: (1) a film-coated tablet 
(25-100 mg per tablet) of the HCl salt of filgotinib and (2) a film-coated tablet (100 mg per tablet) of the maleate salt of filgotinib.

6.3.2 Nonclinical Pharmacology
[IP_ADDRESS] Primary and Secondary Pharmacology
Filgotinib is an adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-competitive inhibitor of JAK1. It is highly 
selective for inhibition of JAK1 among 451 unique kinase gene products tested in vitro. 
In cellular assays, it inhibits biological processes involving JAK1 from 179 nM onwards, with a 30-fold selectivity over JAK2 in human whole blood. A high potency is observed in the rat collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) model.
Metabolite GS-[ADDRESS_539945] established arthritis.
[IP_ADDRESS] Safety PharmacologyFilgotinib and GS-829845 had no effects on the respi[INVESTIGATOR_427222] (CNS) up to respectively 40- and 5-fold the human exposure in RA patients at 200 mg q.d. filgotinib.
Filgotinib and GS-829845 had no relevant effects on cardiovascular parameters 
(human ether-a-go-go [hERG] and dog telemetry studies), apart from a slight non-adverse increase in heart rate (HR) and arterial pressure with GS-829845 at exposures approximately 7-fold that of RA patients treated with 200 mg q.d. filgotinib. There were no relevant effects on electrocardiogram (ECG) and QT.
6.3.[ADDRESS_539946] Metabolism
Filgotinib shows a good oral bioavailability in mice, rats, dogs and minipi[INVESTIGATOR_204931]. Plasma protein binding is low (<70%) in all species, including humans.
The pharmacokinetics (PK) of filgotinib is essentially dose proportional without gender 
differences. No accumulation occurs with repeated dosing. The mean terminal half-life after oral administration is 4 and 5 hours in rats and dogs, respectively.
Filgotinib showed a rapid and even distribution throughout the body in the rat. High 
concentrations were only observed in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and urinary bladder. Filgotinib does not penetrate into the CNS tissues. Filgotinib distribution indicates some affinity of the test compound for melanin-containing tissues. 
Excretion is nearly complete within [ADDRESS_539947]-dosing. Fecal and urinary excretion 
accounted for 40% and 53% of the administered dose, respectively, with a bile secretion of about 15%.
In vitro metabolism studies in all species revealed one major metabolite (GS-829845). 
The formation of GS-829845 is mediated by [CONTACT_204958] (CES) and is not dependent on cytochrome P450 (CYP).
CONFIDENTIALGalapagos NV [ADDRESS_539948] shown that drug-drug interactions with filgotinib and 
GS-829845 are unlikely. There is no inhibition or induction of CYPs or uridine 5’-diphosphate glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) and no relevant inhibition of key drug transporters, including the organic anion transporters (OATs) involved in the renal elimination of MTX, by [CONTACT_347094]-829845.
6.3.4 Nonclinical Toxicology
In repeat oral dose toxicity studies in both rats and dogs, the primary target tissues 
identified for filgotinib were the lymphoid tissues which is expected based on the pharmacology of JAK inhibition. Additional filgotinib-related findings were observed in the male reproductive organs of both species, and in the incisor teeth of rats only. Effects on the lymphoid system were fully reversible. Testicular toxicity demonstrated partial reversibility; however, sperm counts remained low. A dose of 200 mg/day of filgotinib results in an estimated mean clinical AUC of 2.80 μg•h/mL in RA subjects, which 
represents an exposure margin of 2.3, 1.8, and 3.4-fold when considering the mean AUC in male dogs at the no-observed-effect-levels (NOELs) in the [ADDRESS_539949] any effects on fertility parameters in either male or female rats.
In an in vitro phototoxicity study in 3T3 cells, the metabolite GS-829845 was positive for 
phototoxic potential and results with filgotinib were equivocal. A follow-up in vivo rat phototoxicity assay revealed a lack of phototoxic potential for both compounds.
6.4 Clinical Trials of FilgotinibComprehensive data from the Phase 1 and 2 programs are available to support 
development into Phase 3. In general, filgotinib has been safe and well tolerated in all populations studied. A detailed description of all clinical studies can be found in the IB. 
Phase 2b GLPG0634-CL-203, filgotinib with MTX in RAIn GLPG0634-CL-203, subjects with active RA on stable dose of MTX were 
randomized to receive either placebo or one of three total daily doses of filgotinib (50 mg, 100 mg, or 200 mg) on a once or twice daily schedule for 24 weeks. The 
CONFIDENTIALGalapagos NV 13 May 2021
Protocol GLPG0634-CL-205 Version 1 Amendment 4 Page 16 of 79
primary objective of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of different doses and dose 
regimens of filgotinib compared to placebo at Week 12.
The percentage of American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20 responders was 
statistically significantly higher in the 100 mg and 200 mg once daily, and 100 mg twice daily dose groups at Week 12 and in the 100 mg and 200 mg once daily, and 50 mg and 100 mg twice daily dose groups at Week 24. The percentage of ACR50 responders was statistically significantly higher compared with placebo across all filgotinib dose groups and regimens at both Weeks 12 and 24 (Table 6-1 ). The 
percentage of ACR70 responders was statistically significantly higher in the filgotinib 200 mg once daily and 100 mg twice daily dose groups compared with placebo at Week 12 and across all filgotinib dose groups and regimens at Week 24. A dose-response was observed for all three parameters. In addition, the ACR20 response appeared to plateau at Week 8 in the majority of filgotinib treatment groups and was maintained up to Week 24. At Week 24, the ACR50 response was maintained and the ACR70 response continued to increase compared with Week 12.
Starting at week 2 response was observed for ACR20 and ACR50 . No statistically 
significant difference was found between the once and  twice daily regimens.

Diagnostic Activity Index ( SDAI) and Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) score was statistically significantly greater across all filgotinib dose groups and regimens compared with placebo (with the exception of filgotinib 50 mg once daily dose group at Week 12). In addition, the mean SDAI and CDAI scores were maintained after Week 12 in the 50 m g  daily dose groups and continued to improve up to Week 24 in the 100 mg and 200 mg daily dose groups.
No unexpected safety findings were noted. Overall, no differences were observed in 
the incidence of treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) reported for subjects in any of the dosing groups, including placebo, for the duration of the study. TEAEs were reported for 51.2% of “All Placebo Exposed” subjects (ie, all subjects combined who received placebo during either the entire [ADDRESS_539950] 12 weeks) and 51.5% of “All filgotinib Exposed” subjects (ie, all subjects combined who received filgotinib during either the entire [ADDRESS_539951] 12 weeks, irrespective of dose).
A total of 15 subjects had ≥1 serious TEAE; 4 subjects in the placebo group (4.7%) and 
11 subjects (2.0%) in one of the filgotinib groups. One of these subjects with ≥[ADDRESS_539952] discontinued the study. A total of 23 subjects had ≥1 AE leading to permanent discontinuation of the study medication and the study; 2 subjects (2.3%) in the placebo group and 21 subjects (3.9%) in one of the filgotinib groups (including a subject in the filgotinib 100 mg q.d. group who had a pre-dosing AE which was ongoing throughout the study, for which the study medication was permanently discontinued). Most of the serious TEAEs and the AEs leading to discontinuation (by [CONTACT_11702]) were experienced by a single subject.
For the duration of the study, the most common (≥10%) TEAEs reported by [CONTACT_427234], were Infections and Infestations and Gastrointestinal disorders. There were no differences between subjects who received placebo or filgotinib in the severity of TEAEs (most TEAEs were mild or moderate; severe TEAEs were observed in 1.2% of “All Placebo Exposed” subjects and in 2.2% of “All filgotinib Exposed” subjects). Treatment-related TEAEs were generally reported more often for subjects in the filgotinib dosing groups than in the placebo group (9.3% with placebo and 20.3% with filgotinib); however, within the different filgotinib dosing groups, no clear dose relationships were observed.
Six serious infections were reported (1 in placebo arm, 5 in filgotinib arm). All 6 serious 
and one additional non-serious infection in the filgotinib group led to dosing discontinuation. Up to Week 24, herpes zoster infections were observed in 5 subjects (1 placebo treated patient and 4 filgotinib). No cases of tuberculosis, opportunistic infections, lymphoma, or cancer were reported throughout the 24-week dosing period.
Laboratory data were consistent with prior phase [ADDRESS_539953],

including hemoglobin, neutrophil, lymphocyte, creatinine, lipid, and hormone data are 
summarized below. 
Up to Week 12, small increases were observed in mean hemoglobin concentrations in 
the filgotinib 200 mg daily dose groups (increase of 4.4 g/L from baseline in the filgotinib 100 mg bid group). Thereafter, hemoglobin mean concentrations appeared to plateau and remain stable until Week 24 (increase of 4.9 g/L from baseline in the filgotinib 100 mg bid group). 
Up to Week 4, dose-dependent decreases were observed in mean absolute neutrophil 
counts in the filgotinib treatment groups. Mean absolute neutrophil counts appeared to plateau and remained stable until Week 24. No decreases in mean absolute lymphocyte counts were observed, including lymphocyte subsets. 
Up to Week 4, dose-dependent decreases were observed in mean absolute platelet 
counts in the filgotinib treatment groups. Mean absolute platelet counts appeared to plateau and remained stable. Dose-dependent increases in the filgotinib groups were observed in mean creatinine concentrations during the first [ADDRESS_539954] filgotinib treatment groups (up to Week 8 for the filgotinib 100 mg bid group) that subsequently plateaued and remained stable up to Week 24. 
Up to Week 4, dose-dependent increases were observed in mean concentrations of 
total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and triglycerides in all filgotinib treatment groups. All these lipid parameters further increased up to Week 8 in the filgotinib 200 mg daily dose groups. Thereafter, these increases appeared to plateau and maintained at stable mean concentrations up to Week 24. At Week 24, mean increases were observed of 0.7 mmol/L in total cholesterol, 0.3 mmol/L in LDL cholesterol, 0.3 mmol/L in HDL cholesterol, and 0.1 mmol/L in triglycerides in the filgotinib 100 mg bid group.
In male subjects, small non dose-dependent increases were observed in total and free 
testosterone during the study (at Week 24, mean increases were 3.4 nmol/L for total and 51.7 pmol/L for free testosterone in the filgotinib 100 mg bid group). For FSH, inhibin B, LH, and prolactin, small changes (both increases and decreases) were observed during the study, without any trends of larger changes in male subjects of one or more of the different treatment groups.
GLPG0634-CL-204, Filgotinib administered as monotherapy in RA SubjectsThe primary objective of study GLPG0634-CL-204 was to evaluate the efficacy of 
three doses of filgotinib q.d. compared to placebo at Week 12.
As shown in Table 6-2  the percentage of ACR20 and ACR50 responders at week 12 
was statistically significantly higher across all filgotinib dose groups compared with 
placebo. The percentage of ACR70 responders in the filgotinib 100 mg and 200 mg 
once daily dose groups  was statistically significantly higher compared with placebo . 
At Week 24, the ACR50 response was maintained and the ACR70 response showed continued improvement. An early onset of response was observed for ACR20

(from Week 1 in the filgotinib 200 mg once daily dose group and Week 4 across all 
other dose groups), ACR50 (from Week 2 in the filgotinib 200 mg once daily dose group and Week 4 across all other filgotinib dose groups), and ACR70 (Week 4 in the filgotinib 200 mg once daily dose group). The time to ACR20/50/70 response was shorter in all filgotinib dose groups compared with placebo.

At Week 12, the mean decrease in DAS28(CRP) was statistically significantly greater across all filgotinib dose groups compared with placebo. At Week 24, the mean decrease in DAS28(CRP) was maintained in the [ADDRESS_539955] dose groups. In addition, at Week 12, the percentage of subjects with DAS28(CRP) remission was higher across all filgotinib dose groups compared with placebo. Differences vs. placebo were not statistically significant for any of the filgotinib dose groups. The number of subjects with DAS28(CRP) < 2.6 and <  3 . 2  were higher across all filgotinib dose groups compared with placebo at Week 12; differences vs. placebo were statistically significant for the filgotinib [ADDRESS_539956] 12 weeks of treatment and the full 24 weeks of treatment. TEAEs were reported for 38.9% of “All Placebo Exposed” subjects (ie, all subjects combined who received placebo during the first 12 weeks) and 41.3% of “All filgotinib Exposed” subjects (ie, all subjects combined 
CONFIDENTIALGalapagos NV [ADDRESS_539957] 
12 weeks, irrespective of dose).
No deaths were reported and a total of 9 subjects had a serious TEAE; [ADDRESS_539958] 
(1.4%) during placebo dosing and 8 subjects (2.9%) during filgotinib dosing. No serious TEAE (by [CONTACT_11702]) was experienced by [CONTACT_726] [ADDRESS_539959] discontinued the study. There were no differences in incidences of AEs leading to discontinuation among all the different dosing groups, including placebo. A total of 11 subjects had ≥1 TEAE leading to discontinuation of the study medication; 4 subjects (5.6%) during placebo dosing and 7 subjects (2.5%) during filgotinib dosing.
During the whole study, the most common TEAEs reported by [CONTACT_427235], were ‘Infections and Infestations’ and ‘Gastrointestinal disorders’. There were no differences between subjects who received placebo or filgotinib in the severity of TEAEs (most TEAEs were mild or moderate; severe TEAEs were observed in 1.4% of “All Placebo Exposed” subjects and in 1.1% of “All filgotinib Exposed” subjects). Treatment-related TEAEs were generally reported more often for subjects in the filgotinib treatment groups than in the placebo group (9.7% with placebo and 16.7% with filgotinib); however, within the different filgotinib treatment group, no clear dose relationships were observed.
Low numbers of infections were reported as serious (4 subjects with filgotinib) or led to 
discontinuation of the study medication (2 serious infections; ie, cellulitis and pneumonia) were observed during the study. Up to Week 24, [ADDRESS_539960] (filgotinib 50 mg q.d. group) had a herpes zoster infection. No cases of tuberculosis, opportunistic infections, lymphoma, or cancer were reported throughout the 24-week treatment period.
Laboratory data were consistent with prior studies and no new safety findings were 
observed.
Please refer to the IB for additional data regarding efficacy and safety.6.5 Risk/Benefit Assessment for the StudyA detailed description of all clinical studies can be found in the IB.Nonclinical studies in rats and dogs identified the testes and lymphoid tissue as target 
organs for filgotinib in long term repeat-dose toxicity studies. In both species, histopathological changes in the testes included germ cell depletion and degeneration, with reduced sperm content and increased cell debris in the epi[INVESTIGATOR_427223]. The dog was determined to be the most sensitive species. A dose of 200 mg/day of filgotinib results in an estimated mean clinical AUC of 2.8 μg•h/mL, 
which represents an exposure margin of 2.3, 1.8, and 3.4-fold when considering the 
mean AUC in male dogs at the no-observed-effect-levels (NOELs) in the [ADDRESS_539961] not been 
shown in clinical studies. 
Filgotinib has shown an increased risk of embryofetal malformations at exposures 
similar to human doses; the use of highly effective contraception in the subject population will be implemented in the study to mitigate this risk.
No clinically relevant impact on cardiovascular parameters (including vital signs and 
ECG), respi[INVESTIGATOR_427224] 1 and 2 trials of filgotinib.  Across phase 2 trials in RA, filgotinib was well tolerated. In the RA studies (including this study), infections were reported more commonly in the filgotinib groups, including serious infections leading to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], and even death. The most common system organ classes (SOC) with AEs were infections and infestations, and gastrointestinal disorders. Dose dependent decreases in the phase 2b studies were observed in mean neutrophil counts and platelet counts (but mean changes in both remained within normal laboratory reference ranges), and there were no decreases in lymphocytes or lymphocyte subsets. Hemoglobin levels slightly improved (increased) with filgotinib treatment, confirming that no anemia was induced. Mild and clinically insignificant serum creatinine increases were noted in both Phase 2b studies, with stabilization by [CONTACT_10585] 24.  Neutrophil decreases (in the RA population) and a potential increased risk of infection may be considered risks consistent with the mechanism of JAK inhibition.  
Overall clinical findings and laboratory changes are consistent with selective JAK1 
inhibition and based on Phase [ADDRESS_539962] (DSMB) reviews were 
discontinued as ongoing review of safety and efficacy data by [CONTACT_456]’s clinical study team was considered sufficient by [CONTACT_456], based on the current development status of filgotinib and the open-label design of the study.
The overall risk:benefit balance of this study is considered favorable. For additional 
information about the risks of filgotinib, reference is made to the investigator brochure.
6.[ADDRESS_539963] remained, since current conventional and biological DMARDs sometimes fail or produce only a partial response. Therefore, there is still a need for orally administered novel therapi[INVESTIGATOR_15128] a different mechanism of action that can effectively modify the disease course and are safe and well tolerated.  
Filgotinib is a small molecule for oral daily administration that has shown promising 
results as a potentially safe and effective RA treatment. Study GLPG0634-CL-205 is a therapeutic open-label phase 2 extension study to assess the long-term safety and efficacy of a stable dose (200 mg q.d. or 100 mg b.i.d.) of filgotinib up to marketing of the 
CONFIDENTIALGalapagos NV [ADDRESS_539964]’s disability, fatigue, and quality of life.
As a follow-up study, which will begin following the subject’s completion of either of the 
previous core phase 2b studies (GLP0634-CL-203 and GLP0634-CL-204), data will be gathered up to the submission of the compound to regulatory authorities and enable assessment of the long-term effects of filgotinib administration. 
The study’s primary endpoint is to assess the long-term safety and tolerability of filgotinib 
and will focus on the changes in safety parameters in order to detect any treatment-emergent effect related to the long-term daily administration of a stable 200 mg dose (200 mg q.d. or 100 mg b.i.d.) of filgotinib. 
The secondary endpoints will focus on the efficacy over a long-term period and to 
evaluate the long-term effects on the subject’s disability, fatigue, and quality of life. The efficacy assessments will be the same as for the previous core studies and will focus on the changes in efficacy parameters in order to detect any effects related to the long-term daily administration of a stable 200 mg daily dose of filgotinib, given as q.d. or divided b.i.d. The ACR criteria for 20%, 50%, and 70% improvement in disease activity (ACR20, ACR50, and ACR70) responses and the disease-activity score based on 28 joints (DAS28) are considered reliable measures of response to treatment and disease activity, respectively. Assessment of the ACR criteria will allow for a straightforward interpretation of a positive clinically meaningful result and has been shown to achieve high discriminatory capacity and is therefore considered an adequate efficacy endpoint for long-term studies. Evaluation of continuous outcome measures of DAS28 and ACR-N as secondary endpoints enables the demonstration of improvement and magnitudes of benefit for study subjects. The European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) response criteria that classify subjects as non-, moderate, or good responders are dependent on the extent of change and the level of disease activity reached. These criteria are useful when describing clinically meaningful therapeutic targets. Quality of Life (functional assessment of chronic illness therapy [FACIT] and 36-item short-form health survey [SF-36]) assessed during the course of study treatment, provides further insight into the effects on modifying the disease course and its impact on everyday life.  
6.[ADDRESS_539965] been resolved, and at the investigator’s discretion. Subjects can also continue filgotinib [ADDRESS_539966] revealed that a high level of efficacy 
is achieved with a 200 mg daily dose and there is no added value administering higher (300 mg) doses. In the initial proof-of-concept study, ACR20 at Week 4 was achieved by 92%, 75% and 33% of subjects in the 100 mg b.i.d., 200 mg q.d., and placebo groups, respectively. In the second completed phase 2a study, ACR20 by [CONTACT_10585] 4 was achieved by 65% of subjects in the 300 mg daily dose group compared to 41% for placebo. 
Thus 200 mg daily was chosen as the dose to be administered to give optimal efficacy 
while maintaining appropriate safety margins based on the preclinical evaluation. To gather data on long-term safety and efficacy on both q.d. and b.i.d. treatment regimens with filgotinib, subjects will remain on the same treatment regimen as during the preceding core study (GLPG0634-CL-203: either q.d. or b.i.d.; GLPG0634-CL-204: q.d.).

7 Study Objectives
7.1 Primary Objective
The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of 
filgotinib for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.
7.2 Secondary ObjectivesThe secondary objectives of the study are:
To evaluate the long-term efficacy of filgotinib.
To evaluate the long-term effects of filgotinib administration on subjects’ disability, 
fatigue, and quality of life. 
CONFIDENTIALGalapagos NV [ADDRESS_539967] completed one of the previous 2 core studies (GLPG0634-CL-203 or GLPG0634-CL-204). All subjects will start the study at the same dose level (filgotinib 200 mg daily, administered either as 200 mg q.d. or as 100 mg b.i.d., depending on the dosing regimen [frequency of intake of active IMP] that was administered during the preceding core study). The investigator may decide to decrease the daily dose of filgotinib to [ADDRESS_539968] resolved, and at the investigator’s discretion. Subjects can also continue filgotinib 100 mg q.d. when deemed necessary by [CONTACT_093]. Subjects coming from the GLPG0634-CL-204 study will be allowed to start MTX treatment, if deemed necessary according to the investigator’s clinical judgment. 
Subjects have entered the study at Entry Visit on Day -1, which occurred on the same 
day as the last visit from the previous core study (GLPG0634-CL-203 or GLPG0634-CL-204). Subjects participating in the study have been requested to attend Quarterly Evaluation Visits (QEVs) every 12 weeks. If necessary, unscheduled visits can occur in between the scheduled study visits, for instance, in case the dose of study medication is to be adapted. In case of early withdrawal, an Early Discontinuation Visit (EDV) will be scheduled. 
The duration of the participation and treatment for any subject in this study is expected 
to last for several years (from Entry visit to Follow-up Visit) and will be determined by [CONTACT_427236]: 
Open label period (approximately 96 months).
Marketing Application Approval/Withdrawal in Country of Residence.
Applicable local reimbursement procedures are in place.
Sites will be notified once these criteria are met. 
Following marketing, local (if applicable) regulatory and/or pertinent local reimbursement 
approval of the study medication, subjects should return to their next quarterly scheduled study visit as specified in the protocol. This visit will serve as a Final Visit and the subjects will be considered as having completed the treatment part of the study. At the end of the study, subjects will be requested to attend a Follow-up Visit approximately 2 weeks after the Final Visit.

8.4 Criteria for Interruption or Discontinuation of Study Treatment
8.4.1 Study Drug Interruption Considerations:
The medical monitor should be consulted prior to study drug interruption when 
medically feasible. 
Study drug interruption should be considered in the following circumstances; prior to 
resumption of study drug, the investigator should discuss the case with the medical monitor:
Intercurrent illness that would, in the judgment of the investigator, affect 
assessments of clinical status to a significant degree.   
Subject is scheduled for elective or emergency surgery (excluding minor skin procedures under local or no anesthesia); timing of study drug pausing should be determined in consultation with the medical monitor.   
CONFIDENTIALGalapagos NV 13 May 2021
Protocol GLPG0634-CL-205 Version 1 Amendment 4 Page 29 of 79
Any subject who develops a new infection during the study should undergo prompt 
and complete diagnostic testing appropriate for an immunocompromised individual, and the subject should be closely monitored.
Subjects with newly positive (converted) QuantiFERON® [or equivalent] TB test should be evaluated for active TB. Subjects who are diagnosed with latent TB (including chest X ray evaluation), should interrupt study drug dosing and initiate an adequate course of prophylaxis as per local standard of care; study drug is not to be resumed until after TB treatment has been initiated, as per local standard of care. Subjects may resume study drug only after investigator’s written consultation with the medical monitor.
QuantiFERON® tests with indeterminate results may be repeated one time via the central lab. If the repeat result is also indeterminate, the result will be considered positive for the purposes of this study. 
NOTE: During the time of study drug interruption for any of the above, the subject 
may continue to have study visits and to take part in procedures and assessments, if deemed medically appropriate by [CONTACT_093].
The medical monitor should consult the medical leader as needed.
8.4.2 Study Drug Discontinuation Considerations:
The medical monitor should be consulted prior to study drug discontinuation when 
medically feasible. 
Study medication should be permanently discontinued in the following instances:
Any opportunistic infection 
Any subject with active TB
Any serious infection that requires parenteral/intravenous antimicrobial therapy or 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or any infection that meets SAE reporting criteria. 
Complicated herpes zoster infection (with multi-dermatomal, disseminated, 
ophthalmic, or CNS involvement)
Evidence of active HCV during the study, as evidenced by [CONTACT_427237]
Evidence of active HBV during the study, as evidenced by [CONTACT_427238]
Unacceptable toxicity, or toxicity that, in the judgment of the investigator, compromises the subject’s ability to continue study-specific procedures or is considered to not be in the subject’s best interest
CONFIDENTIALGalapagos NV 13 May 2021
Protocol GLPG0634-CL-205 Version 1 Amendment 4 Page 30 of 79
Treatment failure deemed by [CONTACT_427239].
Subject request to discontinue for any reason
Subject noncompliance
Pregnancy during the study (Section [IP_ADDRESS].1.5 and App endix 13.8)
Discontinuation of the study at the request of Galapagos, a regulatory agency or an institutional review board or independent ethics committee (IRB/IEC)
Subject use of prohibited concurrent therapy may trigger study drug discontinuation; consultation should be made with the medical monitor.

other subjects will switch to 200 mg daily, keepi[INVESTIGATOR_427225] (q.d. or b.i.d.) they had in the preceding core study.
This will be done according to a pre-specified randomization scheme prepared by [CONTACT_427242] . Upon qualification for the study, subjects 
will be randomized using a computerized interactive voice/web response system (IXRS) 
to filgotinib 200 mg q.d. 
or 100 mg b.i.d. in a 1:[ADDRESS_539981] the IXRS system and will be given 
the appropriate kit number to be dispensed. The kit will contain the relevant study medication until the next visit.
8.6.5 Selection of Doses in the Study
Details of the selection of doses in the study are presented in Section [IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_539982]
The study medication will be administered once daily (in the morning) with a glass of 
water for q.d. dosing, and twice daily (in the morning and evening) with a glass of water for b.i.d. dosing.
For missed dose(s) of study medication, subjects should be instructed to take the missed 
dose(s) of study medication as soon as possible during the same day. If the missed dose is not taken on the original day, subjects should be cautioned not to double the next dose with the missed dose of study drug under any circumstances. In those cases, the missed dose should be returned to the study drug bottle.
Dose reduction during the study is allowed in the case of intolerance or safety reasons, 
where investigators will be allowed to decrease the dose from 200 mg q.d. to 100 mg q.d. or from 100 mg b.i.d. to 100 mg q.d. Subjects will then be allowed to return to the full dose of filgotinib (200 mg q.d. or 100 mg b.i.d. as appropriate) after the reasons for decreasing the dose have resolved, and at the investigator’s discretion. Subjects can continue filgotinib [ADDRESS_539983] should

Subjects coming from the GLPG0634-CL-204 study will be allowed to restart MTX 
treatment, if deemed necessary according to the investigator’s clinical judgment.
In case new (non-prohibited) therapi[INVESTIGATOR_204940], the 
risk/benefit to the subject should be carefully assessed and consideration given to the timing of any necessary introduction of new medications.
Permitted concomitant medications in the previous core studies and continuing during 
this study include: 
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) provided that the dose was stable 
and, if possible, is kept constant during this study; 
Subjects entering the open-label follow-up study had to be on a stable dose of ≤10 mg/day oral prednisone or its equivalent during one of the 2 core studies. The dose of the oral steroid can be reduced or tapered off during this open-label follow-up study based on the investigator’s discretion;
Analgesics, other than NSAIDs, up to the maximum recommended doses may be used for pain as required. However, subjects must not take analgesics within 24 hours before a visit where clinical efficacy assessments are performed and recorded.
If subjects were taking folic acid in the previous GLPG0634-CL-203 study as a preventive measure for MTX toxicity, this should be continued at a stable dose for the duration of the study. For those subjects in the previous GLPG0634-CL-204 study who are restarting MTX therapy, folic acid may should be given at >5 mg/week total dose or as per local clinical practice and maintained at a stable dose throughout the study. All local standard-of-care practices for the administration of MTX, including laboratory testing, follow-up care and contraindications should be performed according to local standards of care throughout the study. The concomitant use of csDMARDs and medicines with known drug-drug interactions, such as the increased risk of hepatotoxicity and/or nephrotoxicity when MTX is administered with NSAIDs, salicylates, or folate antagonists, should be avoided, as much as possible, in accordance with clinical practice.
Males, and female subjects of childbearing potential, need to continue to use highly 
effective birth-control methods as outlined in Appendix 13.8. The use of hormonal

Vitamin, mineral or herbal supplementations are permitted during the study per 
judgment of investigator and should be kept at a stable dose and regimen, as much as possible.
Prohibited concomitant medications while on study drug include: 
Any DMARDs, other than background MTX, including oral or injectable gold, 
sulfasalazine, azathioprine, D penicillamine, cyclosporine, and leflunomide. Subjects in the previous GLPG0634-CL-204 study who were on a stable dose of antimalarials can continue with the same treatment.
Any cytotoxic agent, including chlorambucil, cyclophosphamide, nitrogen mustard, and other alkylating agents.
Use of any JAK inhibitor or other small molecule immunomodulator
Increases in dosage or dosing regimen of, or initiation of, potent P-gp inducers (e.g. rifampin, phenytoin, carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], and St. John’s wort). Subjects already on stable doses should continue per investigator judgment.

Each of 68 joints will be evaluated for tenderness, and each of 66 joints will be evaluated 
for swelling, except upon receipt of an intra-articular injection of corticosteroid in the previous 3 months, where joints will be classed as not assessable (Appendix 13.2). 
A joint assessor with adequate training and experience in performing joint assessments 
will be designated at each study site to perform all joint assessments. The joint assessor should preferably be a rheumatologist; however, if a rheumatologist is not available, it should be a health care worker with at least one years’ experience in performing joint assessments. The assessor should remain the same throughout the study per subject, as much as possible. It is required that the designated joint assessor identify an appropriate back up assessor to provide coverage if the designated joint assessor is absent.
[IP_ADDRESS].2 Patient’s Global Assessment of Disease ActivityThe Patient’s Global Assessment of Disease Activity will be recorded on a 0 to 100 visual 
analog scale (VAS), with 0 indicating “very well” and 100 indicating “very poor” to the question “Considering all the ways arthritis affects you, how well are you doing today?” (Appendix 13.3).
[IP_ADDRESS].3 Physician’s Global Assessment of Disease ActivityThe Physician’s Global Assessment of Disease Activity will be recorded on a 0 to 
100 mm VAS, with 0 indicating “no disease activity” and 100 indicating “extreme disease activity”. The evaluating physician and the subject must complete the global assessments independently of each other (Appendix 13.4).
[IP_ADDRESS].4 Health Assessment Questionnaire – Disability Index (HAQ-DI)The functional status of the subject will be assessed using the HAQ-DI. This 20-question 
instrument assesses the degree of difficulty a person has in accomplishing tasks in 8 domains (dressing, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reaching, grippi[INVESTIGATOR_204942]/chores). Responses are scored on a 4-point Likert scale from 0 indicating no difficulty to 3, indicating inability to perform a task in that area. The need for aids/devices or help from another person will also be recorded. The HAQ-DI total score ranges from 0 to 3 with higher scores indicating greater dysfunction (Appendix 13.5).
As part of the HAQ-DI, subjects will be asked to assess their average pain during the 
last week on a 0 to 100 mm VAS, with 0 indicating “no pain” and 100 indicating “severe pain”. This assessment should be completed before the joint examination. This pain score will be used to derive the ACR20/50/70.
[IP_ADDRESS].5 FACIT Fatigue ScaleThe FACIT fatigue scale (version 4) measures an individual’s level of fatigue during their 
usual daily activities over the past week. It consists of 13 questions with a 7-day recall period on a 5-point Likert scale, with 0 indicating “not at all” and 4 indicating “very much”. The total score ranges from 0 to 52. The higher the score, the better the quality of life (Appendix 13.6).

The health–related quality of life of the subject will be assessed using the SF-36 (version 
2) with a 4-week recall period. This consists of 36 questions belonging to 8 domains in 2 components:
Physical well-being: 4 domains: physical functioning (10 items), role physical 
(4 items), bodily pain (2 items), and general health (GH) perceptions (5 items).
Mental well-being: 4 domains: vitality (4 items), social functioning (2 items), role emotional (3 items), and mental health (5 items).
The remaining item (health transition) is not part of the above domains but is kept separately (Appendix 13.7).
These scales will be rescaled from 0 to 100 (converting the lowest possible score to [ADDRESS_539995] possible score to 100), with higher scores indicating a better quality of life.
[IP_ADDRESS] Safety Assessments8.[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Event Definitions and Reporting8.[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_539996] administered a 
medicinal (investigational or non-investigational) product. An AE does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational or non-investigational) product, whether or not related to that medicinal (investigational or non-investigational) product.
Serious Adverse EventAn SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose meets any of the following 
conditions:
results in death.
is life-threatening: the subject is at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not 
refer to an event that hypothetically might cause death if it were more severe.
requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081].

An AE is considered unexpected if the nature or intensity is not consistent with the 
applicable product reference safety information. For GLPG0634, the expectedness of AEs will be determined by [CONTACT_427244].
Intensity of an Adverse EventEach AE must be rated on a 3-point scale of increasing intensity:
Mild: Transient or mild discomfort; no limitation in activity; no medical 
intervention/therapy required.
Moderate: Mild to moderate limitation in activity; some assistance may be needed; no or minimal medical intervention/therapy required.
Severe: Marked limitation in activity; some assistance usually required; medical intervention/therapy required; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9841].
If there is a change in intensity of an ongoing AE, it must be recorded as a separate event.
Causality AssessmentThe following decision choice will be used by [CONTACT_427245]. 
Unrelated: No relationship between the AE and the administration of investigational product; related to other etiologies such as concomitant medications or subject’s clinical state.
Unlikely: Event or laboratory test abnormality, with a time to study medication intake that makes a relationship improbable (but not impossible). Disease or other drugs provide plausible explanations.
Possible: Event or laboratory test abnormality, with reasonable time relationship to study medication intake which could also be explained by [CONTACT_19699]. Information on drug withdrawal may be lacking or unclear.
Probable: Event or laboratory test abnormality, with reasonable time relationship to study medication intake. Event unlikely to be attributed to disease or other drugs. Response to withdrawal is clinically reasonable and rechallenge not required.

Protocol GLPG0634-CL-205 Version 1 Amendment 4 Page 45 of 79
Certain: Event or laboratory test abnormality, with plausible time relationship to study 
medication intake which cannot be explained by [CONTACT_19699]. Response to withdrawal is plausible (pharmacologically, pathologically). Event definitive pharmacologically or phenomenologically (ie, an objective and specific medical disorder or a recognized pharmacological phenomenon). Rechallenge satisfactory, if necessary.
Action Taken Regarding Investigational Product
The action taken must be described by [CONTACT_19701]:
Dose not changed: In case no action is taken regarding the study medication.
Study medication permanently withdrawn: In case a subject is permanently 
withdrawn from the study.
Study medication temporarily withdrawn: In case the study medication is temporarily withdrawn.
Dose reduction: If a subject’s daily dose is adjusted from 200 mg to 100 mg (q.d., once daily in the morning).
Not applicable: Other situations (eg, in case an AE started after the last study medication administration).
Outcome
Each AE must be rated by [CONTACT_19701]:
Recovered/Resolved.
Recovered/Resolved with sequelae.
Not recovered/Not resolved.
Fatal.
Recovering/Resolving.
Unknown.

8.8.2 Appropriateness of Measurements
The safety and efficacy assessments are widely used and generally recognized as 
reliable, accurate, and relevant to the disease condition.
8.9 Statistical Methods8.9.1 Statistical and Analytical Plans
A detailed statistical analysis plan will be created and finalized prior to database lock.[IP_ADDRESS] Datasets or Populations AnalyzedAll subjects who received at least one dose of study medication in the 
GLPG0634-CL-[ADDRESS_540002] one dose of study medication in the 
GLPG0634-CL-205 study will be included in the efficacy analysis.
As it is optional that MTX is restarted for subjects rolling over from the 
GLPG0634-CL-204 study, the analysis tables may keep subjects with/without MTX background therapy separated as well as pooled.
Other subgroups may be studied separately, when the sample size is considered to be 
of relevant size.
[IP_ADDRESS] Demographic and Other Baseline CharacteristicsDemographic characteristics will be listed. Demographic and baseline clinical 
characteristics; trial termination reasons; concomitant medications; and drug exposure will be summarized using appropriate descriptive statistics, as applicable.
[IP_ADDRESS] Safety VariablesClinical safety will be evaluated by [CONTACT_427247]-emergent AEs (TEAEs), physical 
examinations, laboratory assessments, ECG results, and vital signs results. The safety analysis may combine the data of all 3 studies (GLPG0634-CL-203, GLPG0634-CL-204, and GLPG0634-CL-205). 
A treatment-emergent analysis of AEs will be done, based on the start date of the AE. 
TEAE (AE and SAE) preferred terms, intensity, frequency, relationship to study medication, dose reductions, and temporary/permanent treatment stops will all be tabulated. An additional analysis based on patient-years of exposure may be added when deemed useful.
Original results and changes from baseline will be summarized for all laboratory, vital 
signs, and ECG parameters, intended to detect any changes in safety parameters that could be attributed to GLPG0634 dosing. No imputations will be done for safety data in cases where subjects discontinued the study prematurely. 
CONFIDENTIALGalapagos NV 13 May 2021
Protocol GLPG0634-CL-205 Version 1 Amendment 4 Page 53 of 79
Further subgroup analyses (e.g., a selection of TEAEs with an onset date during the first 
weeks or months, or a division according to the mean actual dose) and exploratory analyses may be added when deemed appropriate.
[IP_ADDRESS] Efficacy VariablesThe efficacy analysis may combine the data of all 3 studies (GLPG0634-CL-203, 
GLPG0634-CL-204, and GLPG0634-CL-205).
Definition of Efficacy EndpointsACR20The ACR response is a measurement of improvement in multiple disease assessment 
criteria. The ACR20 response is defined as:
≥20% improvement from Baseline in SJC66 and TJC68AND≥20% improvement from Baseline in at least 3 of the following 5 assessments:
Pain (VAS) in cm (from HAQ-DI).
Patient’s Global Assessment of Disease Activity (VAS) in cm.
Physician’s Global Assessment of Disease Activity (VAS) in cm.
Patient’s Assessment of Physical Function as measured by [CONTACT_53820]-DI.
CRP in mg/dL or mg/L.
ACR50 and ACR70ACR50 and ACR70 are similarly defined as ACR20, except the improvement threshold 
from Baseline is 50% and 70%, respectively. 
ACR-NThe ACR-N
[ADDRESS_540003] percentage improvement in swollen and tender joints and 
the median of the remaining 5 core parameters, and is expected to be more sensitive to 
change than the ACR20, ACR50, or ACR70.

ACR/EULAR Remission
A subject’s disease activity status can be defined as being in remission:when scores on the TJC28, SJC28, CRP (actual value in mg/dL), and Patient Global 
Assessment of Disease Activity (cm) are all ≤1.
Simplified Disease Activity Index (SDAI)The SDAI
9 is the numerical sum of 5 outcome parameters: TJC28, SJC28, Patient’s 
Global Assessment of Disease Activity (in cm), Physician’s Global Assessment of 
Disease Activity (in cm), and CRP (mg/dL).
SDAI = TJC28 + SJC28 + Patient’s Global Assessment of Disease Activity (VAS in cm) 
+ Physician’s Global Assessment of Disease Activity (VAS in cm) + CRP (mg/dL)
The SDAI can be categorized:
High disease activity: SDAI >26
Moderate disease activity: [11,26]
Low disease activity: [3.3,11]
Remission: ≤3.3 
Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI)
The CDAI9 is the SDAI modified to exclu de CRP.
CDAI = TJC28 + SJC28 + Patient’s Global Assessment of Disease Activity (VAS in cm) 
+ Physician’s Global Assessment of Disease Activity (VAS in cm)
The CDAI can also be categorized:
High disease activity: >22
Moderate disease activity: [10,22]
Mild disease activity: [2.8,10]
Remission: ≤2.8
Disease Activity Score 28 Joints Corrected for CRP (DAS28[CRP])
The DAS28(CRP)10 is a statistically derived index combining tender joints (28 joints), 
swollen joints (28 joints), CRP, and the Patient’s Global Assessment of Disease Activity 
(GH). DAS28(CRP) is defined as follows:
CONFIDENTIALGalapagos NV 13 May 2021
Protocol GLPG0634-CL-205 Version 1 Amendment 4 Page 55 of 79
DAS28(CRP) = 0.56 x SQRT(TJC28) + 0.28 x SQRT(SJC28) + 0.[ADDRESS_540004](CRP+1) + 
0.014 x GH + 0.96,
Where:TJC28 is [ADDRESS_540005](CRP+1) is the natural logarithm of (CRP value [mg/L] + 1)SQRT is square rootGH is the Patient’s Global Assessment of Disease Activity on a 100 mm VAS 
Categorization of the DAS28(CRP) scores:
High disease activity: >5.1
Moderate disease activity: [3.2,5.1]Low disease activity: [2.6,3.2]Remission: <2.6
EULAR ResponseA second categorization of the DAS28(CRP) will be done according to the following 
table
11:
Improvement in DAS28(CRP) from Baseline:
Actual DAS28(CRP) >1.2 >0.6 and ≤1.2 ≤0.6
≤3.2 Good Moderate None
>3.2 and ≤5.1 Moderate Moderate None
>5.1 Moderate None None
Quality of Life - FACIT Fatigue Scale and SF-36
Quality of life will be assessed using the FACIT fatigue scale and the SF-36 
questionnaire. The appropriate (sub)totals will be derived according to the scale’s scoring algorithm.
Methods of AnalysisEfficacy data (ACR20, ACR50, ACR70, ACR-N, DAS28(CRP), EULAR response, and 
ACR/EULAR remission, components of the ACR, SDAI, and CDAI, and the quality of life data (FACIT fatigue scale and SF 36 questionnaire)) will be analyzed descriptively. 
Details on the analysis will be specified in the statistical analysis plan. A descriptive 
sensitivity analysis by [CONTACT_427248].
Further exploratory analyses may be added when deemed useful to understand the data.

Graphical presentations may be added to facilitate the overall interpretation of the study 
results.
[IP_ADDRESS] Interim AnalysesSafety data will be reviewed by [CONTACT_427249]. Details are presented 
in Section 8.5.
Interim analyses of efficacy and/or safety data may be added when such data are needed (e.g., when the integrated safety and efficacy analyses will be performed for the registration file). If such an interim analysis would be done, no correction for multiplicity will be applied because all analyses will be mainly descriptive.
8.9.2 Determination of Sample Size
It is expected that around 70% of the subjects in the previous core studies 
GLPG0634-CL-203 (N=595, approximately) and GLPG0634-CL-204 (N=280, approximately) will roll over into this study, corresponding to a sample size of roughly 600 subjects: 0.7 x (595 subjects in study 203 + 280 subjects in study 204) = 612.

1) Definitions
a) Definition of Childbearing Potential
For the purposes of this study, a female-born subject is considered of childbearing 
potential following the initiation of puberty (Tanner stage 2) until becoming post-menopausal, unless permanently sterile or with medically documented ovarian failure.  Women who do not meet below criteria for being post-menopausal, are not permanently sterile, or do not have medically documented ovarian failure must have pregnancy testing as outlined by [CONTACT_760].
Women are considered to be in a postmenopausal state when they are ≥ 54 years of 
age with cessation of previously occurring menses for ≥12 months without an 
alternative cause. In addition, women of any age with amenorrhea ≥[ADDRESS_540015] of any age. Bilateral tubal ligation is not considered permanent sterilization.
b) Definition of Male Fertility
For the purposes of this study, a male-born subject is considered fertile after the initiation of puberty unless permanently sterile by [CONTACT_427253]. Vasectomy is not considered permanent sterilization.
2) Contraception for Female Subjects
a) Study Drug Effects on Pregnancy and Hormonal Contraception
Filgotinib is contraindicated in pregnancy as there is a possibility of human 
teratogenicity/fetotoxicity in early pregnancy based on non-clinical data. Data from a  
CONFIDENTIALGalapagos NV 13 May 2021
Protocol GLPG0634-CL-205 Version 1 Amendment 4 Page 77 of 79
drug-drug interaction study of filgotinib and hormonal contraceptives demonstrated that 
filgotinib does not alter the pharmacokinetics of representative hormonal contraceptives levonorgestrel/ethinyl estradiol. For male subjects, male condom should be used; for their female partners of childbearing potential, an accepted contraceptive method should also be considered. Details are outlined below. Please refer to the latest version of the filgotinib investigator’s brochure for additional information.
b) Contraception for Female Subjects of Childbearing Potential
The inclusion of female subjects of childbearing potential requires the use of highly effective contraceptive measures.  Women must have a negative serum pregnancy test from Week [ADDRESS_540016]. In the event of a delayed menstrual period (> one month between menstruations), a pregnancy test must be performed to rule out pregnancy.  This is true even for women of childbearing potential with infrequent or irregular periods. Female subjects must agree to use one of the following methods from the Entry Visit until [ADDRESS_540017] dose of study drug for females of childbearing potential who were taking concurrent MTX therapy, as indicated by [CONTACT_427254].
Complete abstinence from intercourse of reproductive potential.  Abstinence is an 
acceptable method of contraception only when it is in line with the subject’s preferred and usual lifestyle.
Or
Consistent and correct use of 1 of the following methods of birth control listed 
below. 
Intrauterine device (IUD) with a failure rate of <1% per year
Tubal sterilization
Essure micro-insert system (provided confirmation of success 3 months after

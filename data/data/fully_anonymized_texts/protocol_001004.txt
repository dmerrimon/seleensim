Full Title:   A phase II study of high dose Vitamin C intravenous infusion in 
patients with resectable or metastatic solid tumor malignancies  
Short Title:        High dose  Vitamin C infusion for solid tumor malignancies   
Clinical Phase:      Phase II   
Principal Investigator:   [INVESTIGATOR_30444] A. Shah, MD   
Sample Size:    Cohort A = 20 evaluable (max 22);  
    Cohort B = 25 evaluable (max 28)  
    Cohort C = 20 patients (max 28)   
Accrual Ceiling:    This study will enroll at most 78 subjects.     
Study Population:    Adult patients with a solid tumor malignancy who are eligible for 
resection (cohort A), or with extended RAS (e.g. KRAS or NRAS 
mutation) or BRAF mutation with metastatic cancer that have had 
at least 1 line of therapy (cohort B). We w ill target colorectal 
cancer which is known to have 40 -50% rate of extended RAS (e.g. 
KRAS or NRAS) or BRAF mutations, as well as patients with 
other solid tumors that are enriched for extended RAS (e.g. KRAS 
or NRAS) or BRAF mutations including pancreatic  cancer and 
lung cancer.    
    Cohort C will include patients with metastatic colorectal cancer 
with a known mutation in extended RAS (e.g  KRAS or NRAS) or 
BRAF mutation with liver metastases amenable to 
radioembolization (RAE) therapy.  This will be a dose escalation 
cohort with patients receiving ascorbate at 0.5 g/kg, 0.75 g/kg, 1.0 
g/kg, and 1.25 g/kg dosing.  Treatment will commence  the week of 
RAE, with the test dose administered prior to RAE, and the 
treatment dose of VIT C to be administered on the day of RAE.  
VIT C will continue  for 1 -2 weeks following RAE (for a total of  
up to 3 weeks of therapy ).  At the maximal tolerated dose, a n 
additional 4 patients will be treated in a dose expansion phase.  
Patients who clinically require a 2 Pnd
P Y90 treatment may be eligible 
for the study (Cohort C) again and  treated at  one dose level below 
the currently enrolling dose level if they have not e xperienced prior 
DLT with previous protocol therapy.  
Accrual Period:    72 months

Page 2   Study Design:     This is a multicenter, single arm, 3 -cohort, open -label trial of high 
dose Vitamin C intravenous infusion in subjects with solid tumor 
malignancies who ar e eligible for resection (cohort A) or with 
extended RAS (e.g.KRAS or NRAS) or BRAF mutation metastatic 
cancer who have received prior systemic treatment (cohort B). 
Cohort C will involve patients with colorectal cancer having an 
extended RAS or BRAF mutat ion who are amenable for 
localregional therapy of hepatic metastases with Yttrium -90 
radioembolization.   
Study Duration:   Patients in cohort A receive a high dose vitamin C infusion for 4 
days per week for 2- 4 consecutive weeks prior to surgery. Patients 
in cohort B receive high dose vitamin C infusion for 4 days per 
week for up to 6 months or disease progression. Cohort C wi ll 
receive high dose vitamin C for 1-3 weeks. During week 1 vitamin 
C infusion and Y90  radioembolization of hepatic metastases  will 
occur same day .  Follow up is required for up to 8 weeks after 
enrollment of the study for cohort A and C, and up to 12 months 
after enrollment for cohort B. It is estimated that the study will end 
on 06/30/2023.

1.  Study Objectives  
    
The objective of the study is to investigate whether high dose vitamin C infusion leads to 
pathological tumor response in resectable colorectal, pancreatic, and lung cancer (cohort A) or 
objective tumor response in extended RAS (e.g. KRAS or NRAS mutantion) or BRAF mutant solid tumors (cohort B).   
  
1.1 Primary Objectives   
  
A. To assess preliminary antitumor activity (pathological tumor response) of high 
dose vitamin C infusion, measured by [CONTACT_259331], pancreatic, and lung cancer in Cohort A.   
B. To assess disease control rate (DCR) at [ADDRESS_315203] v 1.1 in metastatic colon, pancreatic, and lung cancer (Cohort B). Disease control is defined as complete tumor response, partial tumor response or 
stable disease at 3 months.  
C. To determine the maximal tolerated dose of high dose vitamin C in combination 
with Y90 radioembolization in patients with RAS or BRAF mutant metastatic cancer.   
  
 1.2 Secondary Obj ectives    
  
A. To evaluate the objective response rate (ORR) and progression- free survival (PFS) 
in cohort B and cohort C.   
B. To evaluate pharmacokinetics of high dose Vitamin C.   
C. To evaluate safety of high dose vitamin C administration using CTCAE 4.03.  
  
1.3 Exploratory Objectives  
          
A. To examine the  in vitro activity of vitamin C in tumor organoids from cohort A 
patients. Correlation of GLUT1 protein expression and baseline FDG uptake with 
pathologic (cohort A) or objective response (cohort B);  
B. Pharmacodynamic and exploratory biomarker samples will be collected at the 
time points specified in the protocol.   
  
2.  Background  
  
2.1 Diseases   
  
Colon cancer  
In 2015, a total of 132,700 new cases of colorectal cancer are expected to be diagnosed in 
the [LOCATION_002] accounting for about 8% of all new cancer diagnoses. In this same year 
Protocol # [PHONE_5384] 
Version 8 Date: 08 March 2022 
    
Page 7   49,700 patients will die of metastatic colorectal cancers (mCRC), which will contribute to 
8.4% of all cancer related mortality [1].  Activating KRAS  and BRAF mutations are found 
in approximately 40% and 10% of human colorectal cancers (CRCs), respectively [2].  
BRAF is directly downstream of KRAS, and both activate the mitogen -activated protein 
kinase (MAPK) pathway [3]. Clinical studies indicate that activating mutations in KRAS  
and BRAF predict resistance to and lack of survival benefit from epi[INVESTIGATOR_13392] (EGFR)–targeting agents [4-7]. Bevacizumab, a recombina nt humanized IgG -[ADDRESS_315204] soluble VEGF-A, moderately improved overall survival (OS) when added to chemotherapy regimen FOLFOX4 (12.9 mo compared with 10.8 mo for the group treated with FOLFOX4 alone (hazard ratio for death 0.75) [8]. BRAF mutatio n is an 
independent prognostic factor for decreased survival [7, 9]. However, the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib failed to confer response in previously treated CRCs carrying BRAF mutation, likely due to reactivation of EGFR pathway [10 -12]. Furthermore, the 
combination of a BRAF inhibitor  dabrafenib and MEK inhibitor trametinib led to 2% 
complete response and 12% partial response in a study of 43 BRAF V600-mutant patients [13]. Thus, novel therapi[INVESTIGATOR_259316].   
  
Most relapse of colon cancer occurs in the first 2 years after curative resection [14].  
KRAS exon 2 mutations are independent predictors of shorter time to recurrence (TTR) in 
patients with resected stage III distal colon cancers receiving adjuvant therapy  [15].   
  
Pancreatic cancer  
Pancreatic adenocarcinoma remains one of the most devastating solid tumor malignancies 
with a median survival measured in months and 5-year survival rate of less than 6%. It is 
the fourth leading cause of cancer- related death in Europe and the [LOCATION_002]. Most 
pancreatic cancers are diagnosed at late stage, and only 15 –20% of patients are eligible for 
upfront radical surgery. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_259317], 
recurrent rate is still high. For ex ample, the CONKO- 001 randomized trial reported rates 
of 5- year disease-free survival were 16.6% vs. 14.3%, and median disease- free survival of 
13.4 months vs. 6.7 months in the gemcitabine treatment group compared with the observation group [16]. In metast atic pancreatic cancer, few regimens significantly 
improved overall survival compared to traditional single agent gemcitabine.  The median overall survival was 11.1 months in the FOLFIRINOX group as compared with 6.8 months in the gemcitabine group [17]. The recently FDA-approved nabpaclitaxel improved median survival from 6.7 to 8.5 months when added to gemcitabine in newly diagnosed metastatic patients [18]. Genomic analyses of pancreatic cancer revealed a complex mutational landscape with four common onc ogenic events in wellknown cancer 
genes ( KRAS, TP53, SMAD4 and CDKN2A ), with KRAS mutations found in 92% of 456 
cases studied [19].       
  
Lung cancer   
Approximately 30% of lung adenocarcinoma harbor KRAS mutations, however it is rare 
in sqauamous lung ca ncer [20 -22]. KRAS and EGFR mutations are mutually exclusive, 
and KRAS  mutations has been proposed as a negative predictor of efficacy from EGFR

Page 8   inhibitor erlotinib  [23]. A maintenance basket trial demonstrated patients with EGFR 
mutation who were treated with erlotinib had longer median survival than patients with 
KRAS mutation who were treated with MEK inhibitor selumetinib (3.5 vs 2.3 years), following initial pla tinum doublet chemotherapy [24]. Thus, there is an unmet need to 
develop KRAS mutation-specific therapy.   
   
2.2 Investigational Agent    
  
Ascorbate (vitamin C) is formed in the course of the uronic pathway starting from 
UDP -glucuronate in animals, and i ts synthesis can be considered as an integral part of 
carbohydrate metabolism [25]. Humans lack the enzyme gulonolactone oxidase 
(GLO) which catalyses the last enzymic step in ascorbate synthesis, thus are unable to produce endogenous ascorbate [26]. Ascor bate plays a crucial role in various 
hydroxylation reactions [27]. At low ascorbate concentrations, ascorbate is prone to be a pro-oxidant, and at high concentrations, it will tend to be an antioxidant [28]. 
Since the 1950s, ascorbate has been proposed to have anticancer effects, although 
evidence for improved response rates or survival outcomes has been lacking [29]. It is postulated that generation of intracellular hydrogen peroxide H2O2 is responsible for 
preferential toxicity to tumor cells [30, 31] (Fig. 1).    
  
The failure of earlier studies to observe anti -tumor activity might be due to 
insufficient dosing to maintain tumor cytotoxic plasma concentrations of ascorbic 
acid [32]. Extracellular concentrations as low 100 -200 μM are toxic to some cell 
lines, but many types of malignant cells are killed only at concentrations approaching 
the mM range (Fig. 2). Plasma vitamin C concentrations that are cytotoxic to cancer cells in vitro can be achieved clinically by [CONTACT_33980] (but not oral) administration of 
ascorbate. [33].

In a recent Phase I trial by [CONTACT_259332]. in 2013, ascorbic acid was administered at 1 g/min 
for 4 consecutive days/week for 4 consecutive weeks [ 34]. They found maximum serum 
concentration (Cmax) correlates with area under the curve (AUC) well, and a dose of 50 g/m2 
was able to achieve Cmax of 33 mM. Both 70 g/m2 and 90 g/m2 dose achieved Cmax of 49 

Protocol # [PHONE_5384] 
Version 8 Date: 08 March 2022 
    
Page 10   mM, thus a dose higher than 70 g/m2 does not seem to increase Cmax further (Fig. 3). In 
addition, in each of the [ADDRESS_315205] dose groups (70   90   110 g/m2), plasma vitamin C levels 
were maintained between 10 and 20 mM for 5 to 6 hours. The infusion was generally well tolerated. Treatment -related nausea a nd headache (grade 1-2) were common in all cohorts. Dose 
limiting toxicity was hypernatremia and hypokalemia observed at 90 g/m2 and above. Other 
reported adverse events were hypertension, insomnia, abnormal urine color, loss of appetite, 
fatigue, chills, and hyperglycemia. Among 16 patients who completed study, there was no 
objective tumor response. Three patients had stable disease, while 13 had progressive disease. Of 
note, in a patient of 70 kg, dose of 70 g/m2 is equivalent to approximately 1.8 g/kg which is less than the 4 g/kg twice a day IP dosing used in the animal study described below [35].   
  
In the preclinical study reported by [CONTACT_259333], 4 g/kg twice a day IP dosing achieved a Cmax of 
32 mM at 10 min in xenograft mice with KRAS mutant colon cancer [35]. Treatment of at least 
[ADDRESS_315206] 30% reduction of tumor volume compared to placebo 
group, with maximum reduction (approximately 50%) achieved at 3-4 weeks. Thus, it is 
reasonable to use 50 or 70 g/m2 for 4 consecutive days/week dosing, and a [ADDRESS_315207] dose of 1.5 g/kg (approximately 56 g/m2) per infusion was given, as 
described by [CONTACT_259334]. [36].  
  
  
Fig. 3: Cmax and AUC values versus ascorbic acid dose [34].    
  A dose-escalating phase I study examined safety of combining Vitamin C with standard, fixed 
dose gemcitabine and erlotinib in previously untreated metastatic pancreatic patients [37]. 
Fourteen subjects received an 8 week cycle of intravenous ascorbic acid (three infusions per week, at doses of 50, 75, or 100 g per infusion). The treatment was well tolerated, and of the 23 total adverse events (8 being serious adverse events), most were likely attributable to progression of disease or concomitant treatment with gemcitabine and/or erlotinib. Plasma ascorbic levels were between 25.3 and 31.9 mM in patients who received 100 g per Vitamin C infusion. Among

Version 8 Date: [ADDRESS_315208] dose of 10 g vitamin C 
infusion on week 1 day 1, followed by [CONTACT_49114] 1.25 g/kg vitamin C infusion for week 1, days 2-4 
and 4 days out of 5 weekdays in subsequent weeks, as long as no toxicities of grade 3 or higher 
occur. We favor this dosing regimen as it will achieve Cmax of approximately 40-50 mM and 
level above therapeutic concentration of above 10 mM for approximately 3-4 hours in a typi[INVESTIGATOR_259318] 3 or 4 toxicity based on the Stephenson[34], 
Hoffer [36], and Monti [ 37] phase I trials where responses were seen. Infusions will be given on 
a 4 times per week schedule for 2 -4 weeks in cohort A to allow resection of primary tumor or 
recurrent/metastatic tumor as clinically indicated, and assess pathological response; or u ntil 
toxicity or disease progression. In cohort B weekly infusions will be continued for up to [ADDRESS_315209] been reported [38], thus this study will exclude 
patients with known G6PD deficiency who are at higher risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_259319].

2.3 Rationale  
  
Recently, Yun et al demonstrated that cultured human CRC cells harboring KRAS  or BRAF 
mutations are selectively killed when exposed to high levels of vitamin C [35]. This effect is 
due to increased uptake of the oxidized form of vitamin C, dehydroascorbate (DHA), via the  
GLUT1 glucose transporter. Increased DHA uptake causes oxidative stress as intracellular 
DHA is reduced to vitamin C, depleting glutathione. Thus, reactive oxygen species accumulate and inactivate glyceraldehyde 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) (Fig. 4). 
Inhibition of GAPDH in highly glycolytic KRAS  or BRAF mutant cells leads to an energetic 
crisis and cell death not seen in KRAS  and BRAF wild -type cells. Furthermore, high-dose 
vitamin C impairs tumor growth in Apc/Kras
PG12D
P mutant mice. These findings suggest 
highdose vitamin C infusion may have anti- tumor activity in KRAS  or BRAF mutant colon 
cancer patients.   
  
In cohort A (pre- operative therapy), we will enroll patients with a high likelihood of extended 
RAS (e.g. KRAS or NRAS) or BRAF mutations(eg pancreas, colon, and nonsquamous lung 
cancer).  Patients in this cohort will start treatment with vitamin C prior to the mutation status 
being known (given the ~10-14 day turnaround time for extended RAS (e.g. KRAS or NRAS) or BRAF mutation testing), and we will estimate the effect of high dose vitamin C in 
all patients. Outco me differences between KRAS  and BRAF mutated cancers and wild -types 
will be important secondary analyses.  
  
In cohort B (salvage therapy for metastatic disease), patients will be pre -screened for 
extended RAS (e.g. KRAS or NRAS) or BRAF mutation status, and those patients with 
mutations will be eligible.

Metabolomics and RNA Analysis  
At the cellular level, ascorbate has two forms: reduced form of ascorbate and oxidized form of 
dehydroascorbate (DHA). Tumor cells uptake ascorbate by [CONTACT_259336] C cotransporters 
(SVCTs) via ascorbate form or by [CONTACT_259337] (GLUTs) via DHA form. Recent studies have shown that Kras mutant human colorectal cancers (CRC) cells up -regulate GLUT1 
expression. Mice studies have sh own that ascorbate has a selective accumulation effect on CRC 
cells with Kras mutation, which is known to be mostly refractory to approved targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
  
By [CONTACT_259338] -MS, we found that both ascorbate and DHA accumulate in the Kras -mutated colon 
tumors after patients treated with intravenous ascorbate. DHA seems to be a better marker to assess 
the ascorbate treatment under our conditions. The high levels of threonate, tartarate and other degradation products of DHA further demonstrated the uptake of ascorbate/DHA by [CONTACT_259339].  
  
Intracellular DHA is reduced back to ascorbate at the expense of reduced glutathione (GSH) and 
NADPH. Increased DHA uptake causes ROS accumulated and oxidative stress due to the depletion of cellular GSH. The DNA damage induced by [CONTACT_259340] (ADP -ribose) polymerase, 
which, in turn, decreases NAD+ levels. The low NAD+ level decreases GAPDH activity. Then glycolysis is inhibited in cells that are highly dependent on energy, leading to an energy crisis and cell death. With ascorbate treatment, there is no obviously difference of ATP level observed although glycolysis decreases. Some potential oxidative stress biomarkers, such as uric acid, ADPribose, and 8-oxoGuo/8- oxoGuo, have been found to increase following ascorbate treatment. 
The pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) metabolite accumulation indicates PPP flux increase, which leads to NADPH formation. The increased flux is to restore cytosolic NADPH back to mitigate oxidative stress. Interestingly, the level of GSH does not decrease, while the level of its oxidized form, glutathione disulfide (GSSG) decreases with ascorbate treatment, which indicates that NADPH formed impair the potential oxidative stress.

sequencing has been completed, 92 / 123 pathways involving ROS handling were significantly 
upregulated by [CONTACT_259341].  Similarly, 43/49 pathways involved in oxidative 
stress were also significantly upregulated, as well as 84/ 102 pathways involved in DNA repair.

Version 8 Date:  [ADDRESS_315212] significantly greater activity.  In 
Sept 2018, Alexander and colleagues published their initial report of the safety of high dose ascorbate in combination with radiation for pancreatic cancer, in combination with 
gemcitabine[39].  In this study, patients with locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer received weekly gemcitabine, along with standard radiation to 50.[ADDRESS_315213] fractionation or 50 Gy by [CONTACT_259342] (IMRT), along with high dose ascorbate given in escalating 
doses (50 g  75 g  100 g) daily during radiation.  This study found that 75 g ascorbate given 
intravenously daily during radiotherapy and weekly gemcitabine was safe  and tolerable. There was 
preliminary evidence of improved efficacy as well, with median overall survival of 21.7 months, which compared favorably to a similar historical control population[39]. 
  
  
Recent PK analysis demonstrates that Vitamin C is no longer measurable in the serum  after [ADDRESS_315214] not 
experienced prior DLT with previous protocol therapy.  
 
2.4 Risk/Benefit Assessment   
    
This is a Phase II study to study the effect of vitamin C in patients with solid tumor 
malignancies.  The preclinical data suggest that the activity of vitamin C is specific for 
tumors that harbor the prevalent KRAS or BRAF cancer mutation so we will preferentially treat such tumors (e.g. pancreas, colon, and lung cancer).  The pre- operative setting is chosen 
because it offers an opportunity to obtain tissue following a short course of medical therapy to specifically identify the effect of that therapy on the tumor.  The risk to subjects is minimal 
as there is often a [ADDRESS_315215] therapi[INVESTIGATOR_259320], pancreas, or lung cance rs.  We will 
monitor for efficacy and toxicity closely.  Patients who are not benefiting from therapy may go on to receive other palliative therapy for their disease, as appropriate.  Risks of large doses 
Protocol # [PHONE_5384]  
Version 8 Date:  08 March 2022   
    
Page 16   of vitamin C are rare, and include electrolyte chan ges (hypokalemia, hypernatremia), 
headaches, nausea, hypertension, insomnia, abnormal urine color, loss of appetite, fatigue, 
chills, and hyperglycemia.  For Cohort C, high dose vitamin C has not previously been 
administered to patients who also receive Yttrium- [ADDRESS_315216] dose escalation phase I cohort design.  The 
starting dose of Vitamin C will be 0.5 g/kg given 3-4 x/week for 1week prior to and following standard dose Y -90 radioembolization.  
  
Malignancies with KRAS  or BRAF mutations tend to be more aggressive and offer a worse 
prognosis than wild- type tumors. Therefore, there may a benefit if we can demonstrate 
antitumor activity with vitamin C therapy.    
  
2.5 Correlative Studies Background  
     
1. Yun and colleagues showed that the oxidized form of vitamin C (dehydroascorbic 
acid (DHA)) is shuttled intracellularly via GLUT1 in KRAS or BRAF mutated 
colorectal cancer (CRC) cell lines and mouse models which resulted i n growth 
inhibition and cell death [35]. We expect higher baseline tumor GLUT1 protein 
expression predict tumor response to Vitamin C infusion.     
  
2. In a preclinical study, AMP- activated protein kinase (AMPK) was activated within [ADDRESS_315217] 
by [CONTACT_259343] [35]. We plan to assess tumor energy 
stress by  [CONTACT_259344]- AMPK IHC in resected tumor samples 
from cohort A patients.   
  
3. We will examine tissue specimens for molecular and metabolic changes associated 
with vitamin C use. This will include RNA sequencing (both bulk and single cell 
RNA sequencing depending on tissue availability), and whole exome sequencing.  
Additionally, we will grow organoids from tissue specimens and treat with vitamin C 
in vitro .    
 
4. Patients with solid tumors demonstrate elevated rates of clonal hematopoiesis (C H) 
thus placing them at elevated risk of subsequent cardiovascular disease and 
hematologic cancer[40, 41]. Thus, development of a management strategy to mitigate this risk represents an important unmet need. Environmental stimuli can impact the expansion, attrition, and disease impact of CH clones including high glucose, metformin, and vitamin C. Our objective is therefore to assess the impact of high dose vitamin C on existing CH clones in cancer patients under study. We will isolate peripheral blood and buccal swabs from patients. Genomic DNA will be isolated and

then the timing of each of these should be included.  
  
This is a single arm study, all eligible subjects will be given Vitamin C infusion. In cohort 
A, tumor sample from all patients will be tested for extended RAS (e.g. KRAS or NRAS),  
BRAF mutations, but all eligible patients will start study drug treatment before test result is available. For cohort A, tissue specimens will collected from an optional screening 
biopsy (screening biopsy is not mandatory, but highly encouraged) .and from the on study surgical resection.  For cohort B patients a separate tissue biopsy will be required at 
screen ing and between weeks 3 and 6. This is to confirm extended RAS (e.g. KRAS or 
Protocol # [PHONE_5384]

Cohort C patients, biopsies will be collected at screening and at approximately 6-8 weeks ,  
and will be examined for evidence of increased oxidative stress (eg. RNASeq, 
metabolomics, and Organoid development if not already performed).   
  
March 2021 Update: Cohort C patients will receive vitamin C infusion and Yttrium -90 (Y90) during week [ADDRESS_315227] not experienced prior DLT with previous protocol therapy. Once 
eligibility is confirmed , subjects will be treated at one dose level below the currently 
enrolling dose level in the dose escalation phase.  
 
Y-90 radioembolization is the selective internal radiation therapy of liver tumors utilizing 
SIR-Spheres Y-90 resin microspheres, which were approved by [CONTACT_34033] 2002. SIR-
Spheres Y -90 resin microspheres are microscopic resin beads that contain the radioactive 
isotope yttrium-90 (Y- 90) which emits beta radiation. Due to their small size (average 
size 32.5 microns) and similar specific gravity to blood cells, the microspheres travel 
easily through the hepatic artery. The radioactive microspheres become lod ged in the 
tumor microvasculature. Selective Internal Radiation Therapy (SIRT) with SIR -Spheres 
Y-[ADDRESS_315228] been supplied world wide.  
  
Vitamin C protocol will allow for the use of samples collected through the biobank

5.1 Schedule of Evaluations  
  
After initial screening, patients will receive the agent infusion in four days per week (no  
more than 2 consecutive days of infusion)). Weekly blood testing will be performed once per 
week. Cohort A patients will recei ve infusions on weeks 1-4 or until surgery (minimum 2 weeks 
of vitamin C (8 infusions) are required to consider the patient  evaluable). Cohort B patients will 
receive infusions for up to 6 months or until disease progression. On Day 1 of week 2 (Preferred;  
Day 1 or Day 3 of weeks 2 to 5 is also allowed) patients will remain in the clinic for up to [ADDRESS_315229] 1 week ([ADDRESS_315230] dose is not accounted) of Vit C to be considered ev aluable.
    
Protocol # [PHONE_5384]  
Version 8 Date:  [ADDRESS_315231] 3 
patients were enrolled at a dose of 0.5 g/kg intravenously for 4 days /week for 1-2 weeks prior to 
and following Y90 therapy for a total of 4 weeks of vitamin C.  No dose limiting toxicities were 
identified . The next group of 3 patients receive d a dose of 0.75 g/kg intravenously for 4 days/ 
week for 1 -2 weeks prior to and following Y90 therapy for a total of 4 weeks of vitamin C.  
Subsequent dose escalations will  involve including a single dose of Vitamin C on the day of Y90, 
administered prior to or within 24 hours of  a Y90 treatment, as well as continued dose escalation 
to 1 g/kg and 1.25 g/kg intravenously (Dose levels 3 -6).  Patients will not be treated at a dose 
higher than 1.25 g/kg.  Dose limiting toxicity will be defined as any grade 3 -4 adverse event 
possibly, probably, or definitely attributed to vitamin C therapy in the 21 days of protocol therapy. 
In any group of 3 patients, if one patient experiences dose limiting toxicity, the group will be 
expanded by 3 additional patients (eg.  6 for that group).  If, at any dose level, [ADDRESS_315232] not experienced 
prior DLT with previous protocol therapy. Cohort C Dose levels are as follows:  
 
Dose level  Vit C dose per infusion

Dose level 1  0.5 g/kg  0 
Dose level 2  0.75 g/kg  0 
Dose level 3  0.75 g/kg  0.5 g/kg  
Dose level 4  1.0 g/kg  0.5 g/kg  
Dose level 5  1.0 g/kg  0.75 g/kg  
Dose level 6  1.25 g/kg  0.75 g/kg  
January 2020 update:  Dose level 1 has enrolled without dose limiting toxicity, and patients are 
currently being treated at dose level 2, also without dose limiting toxicity thus far.  
March 2021 update:  Subjects  are currently being treated at dose level 4. 
 
March 2022 update: Beginning with Dose level 5, we stopped administering Vitamin C in Weeks [ADDRESS_315233] not observed any dose limiting toxicity through 
dose level 6.   As a result, we will continue our dose escalation with dose levels 7 and 8, as per the table 
below.  We will also plan to treat up to 4 additional patients at the maximal tolerated dose, so the total accrual for Cohort C will remain 28 evaluable patients .

The DLT observation period will start with the first vitamin C infusion prior to 
radioembolization and end after the last vitamin C infusion post-embolization. A DLT is 
defined as a grade 3+ (latest CTCAE version) adverse event that is at least possibly related to the vitamin C infusion. 
  
 7.  Adverse Event Reporting Requirements   
  
Adverse event (AE) monitoring and reporting is a routine part of every clinical trial.  Safety 
will be monitored by [CONTACT_259347], as well as by [CONTACT_259348], x -rays, electrocardiographs, etc.  
  
7.1 Adverse Event Definition  
  
An adverse event (also referred to as an adverse experience) can be any unfavorable 
and unintended sign (e.g., an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or dis ease 
temporally associated with the use of a drug, and does not imply any judgment about 
causality. An adverse event can arise with any use of the drug (e.g., off- label use, use 
Protocol # [PHONE_5384]  
Version 8 Date:  08 March 2022   
    
Page 32   in combination with another drug) and with any route of administration, formulation, 
or dose, including an overdose.   
    
     7.1.1  Investigational Agent or Device Risks   
The following adverse events were reported in previous clinical studies of 
Vitamin C infusion:   
  
Proteinuria, hypertension, tumor fever, leg edema, hypoalbum inemia,  
hypokalemia, hypernatremia, hypercalcemia, increased creatinine, 
hyperglycemia, peripheral neuropathy, headache, hemolysis, hemorrhage, 
elevated aminotransferase, and kidney stones.   
  
   7.1.2  Adverse Event Characteristics and Related Attributi ons  
  
NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) will be 
utilized for tracking adverse events during the conduct of this study.      CTCAE term (AE description) and grade:  The descriptions and 
grading scales found in the revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 will be utilized for AE reporting.  A 
copy of the CTCAE version 4.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP web site (
Uhttp://ctep.cancer.gov U).  
  
   Attribution  of the AE:  
- Definite – The AE is clearly related  to the study treatment.  
- Probable – The AE is likely related to the study treatment.  
- Possible – The AE may be related  to the study treatment.  
- Unlikely – The AE is doubtfully related to the study treatment.  
- Unrelated – The AE is clearly NOT related  to the study treatment.  
      
   7.1.3    Recording of Adverse Events  
  
All adverse events will be recorded on a patient specific AE log after 
Week 1, Day 1. The AE log will be maintained by [CONTACT_259349]’s research chart.      
  
   7.1.4   Reporting of AE to WCMC IRB  
  
All AEs occurring on this study will be reported to the IRB according to 
the IRB policy, which can be accessed via the following link:

Version 8 Date:  08 March 2022   
    
Page 33   7.2 Definition of SAE  
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” if, in 
the view of the investigator it results in any of the following outcomes:  
• Death (NOTE: death due to disease progression will be recorded on the CRF 
and does not need to be reported as an SAE.  
• A life -threatening adverse drug experience—any adverse experience that 
placed the patient, in the view of the initial reporter, at immediate risk of death 
from the adverse experience as it occurred. It does not include an adverse 
experience that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused 
death.  
• Requires at least a 24 -hour inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6929].  
• A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions.  
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
• Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a serious adverse drug experience when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the 
patient or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed in this definition.  
  
   7.2.1  Reporting of SAE to IRB and DSMB  
All SAEs occurring on this study will be reported to the IRB and DSMB 
according to the IRB policy, which can be accessed via the following link:   
http://researchintegrity.weill.cornell.edu/forms_and_policies/forms/Immed 
iate_Reporting_Policy.pdf.   
  
   
For investigator- initiated studies where the WCM investigator holds the IND, the 
following reporting guidelines apply:   
  
a. A Mandatory MedWatch Form 3500A must be completed and sent to the 
FDA. Specific instructions on how to complete the MedWatch Form 3500A can 
be found on the FDA website.   
b. If the protocol requires SAEs to be reported to an outside agency (i.e., to the 
supplier of the study drug), specific instructions will be stated in the protocol.   
Protocol # [PHONE_5384]  
Version 8 Date:  [ADDRESS_315240] (DSMB), a 
narrative of the event will be submitted to the Regulatory Coordinator on a 
modified SAE cover sheet. The completed form serves as acknowledgement of the 
SAE’s occurrence and will be used to complete the DSMB periodic report. A copy should be filed in the regulatory binder.   
  
d. For multicenter studies, the multicenter core within the Quality Assurance 
Unit (QAU) will distribute the IND Safety Report to participating sites. The  
MedWatch and SAE cover sheet must be emailed to JCTOIIT@med.c ornell.edu 
within 7 days of the investigator notification.   
  
  
7.3 AE/SAE Follow Up  
  
All SAEs and AEs reported during this study will be followed until resolution or until the 
investigator confirms that the AE/SAE has stabilized and no more follow -up is required. 
AE/SAEs attributed to Vitamin C should be followed until resolution. This req uirement 
indicates that follow -up may be required for some events after the patient discontinues 
participation from the study.

9.0 Laboratory Correlative Studies   
 
Using data from this trial, the relationship between molecular markers associated with 
Vitamin C transport and glycolysis, and the clinical outcomes with Vitamin C infusion will be 
explored. Tissue collections will be performed for for GLUT1, metabolomics,  RNA 
sequencing, or ganoids and future correlative studies.  Vitamin C pharmacokinetics will also 
be assessed.  
 
9.1 Serum Vitamin C pharmacokinetics  
 
Vitamin C pharmacokinetics will be measured on the week 2 day 1 of infusion, when 
proposed dose will be administered. If for any reason, PK sample collection is not possible on week 2 day 1, the blood sample should then be collected on day 1 or Day 3 between 
subsequent weeks 2 to 5. For Cohort C, the blood collection for PK analyses may occur during week 2, 4 or 5, on day 1 or 3 of that week.   
 
9.1.1 Method of Assessment  
  
Liquid- chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) will be performed to measure 
Vitam in C levels. Plasma samples will be incubated with 2.5 mM MBB in CH3OH:H2O 
(80:20) at room temperature for 30 min, then diluted with same or 10- fold volume of 
CH3CN:H2O (70:30) containing 0.025% formic acid. The diluted samples will be briefly 
vortexed and centrifuged for 20 min at 20,000g to pellet precipi[INVESTIGATOR_259323]. The 
supernatants will be transferred to autosampler vials with 3 μL solution injection for analysis by [CONTACT_29864]/MS. For absolute concentration of vitamin C measurements, MBB treated 
plasma will be diluted with 6 -fold volume of 70% CH3CN containing 0.025% formic acid 
and 1 μL solution was injected for LC/MS.  
  
Q-TOF LC/MS analysis will be performed as referenced [42]. Ascorbic acid will be 
detected in both negative mode ([M- H]- at m/z 175.0248) and positive mode ([M+H]- at 
m/z 177.0394) with retention times of 1.92 min and 0.99 min for ANP and RP columns, 
respec tively. A vitamin C calibration curve will be established for free plasma in the 0 -
600 uM concentration range. Accuracy and precision will be evaluated by [CONTACT_259350][INVESTIGATOR_259324] C standards in plasma.   
  
9.1.2 Collection of Specimen(s)  
 
For Vitamin C pharmacokinetics, peripheral blood will be collected at the following time  
points: (+/- 15 minute window)

rRNA band at 1.9 kb.   
  
RNA sequencing:  mRNA will be purified from total RNA and fragmented following 
protocols from Illumina Inc. (San Diego, CA).  cDNA library will be constructed by [CONTACT_259351], end repair, addition of ‘A’ Bases to the 3' end, adapter ligation, and PCR amplification. The l ibrary will be denatured and hybridized onto a flow cell 
using cBot to generate clonal clusters of the DNA fragments. Paired end sequencing-by-synthesis will be performed on the HiSeq4000 platform. After the HiSeq 
generates the sequencing images, the data is analyzed in three steps: image analysis, 
base calling, and sequence analysis.

Objective Response (ORR) i s defined as the proportion of patients with a documented 
complete response or partial response (CR + PR) based on RECIST 1.1.   
  
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph 
nodes (whether target or non- target) must have reduction in short axis to <10 mm. 
Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, 
taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.  
Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of  target lesions, 
taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also 
demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note: the appearance of one or more new 
lesions is also considered progression).  
Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to 
qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study.  
  
Disease control (DC): this is defined as a CR, PR or SD.

 11.  Data Reporting / Regulatory Considerations    
11.1 Data Collection  
The data collection plan for this study is to utilize REDCap to capture all treatment, 
toxicity, efficacy, and adverse event data for all enrolled patients.   
11.1.1 REDCap   
  
REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) is a free data management software 
system that is fully supported by [CONTACT_57421] -Cornell Medical Center CTSC.  It is a tool 
for the creation of customized, secure data management systems that include 
Webbased data-entry forms, reporting tools, and a full array of security f eatures 
including user and group based privileges, authentication using institution LDAP 
system, with a full audit trail of data manipulation and export procedures.  REDCap is 
maintained on CTSC -owned servers that are backed up nightly and support encrypted

 12.  Statistical Considerations  
  
12.1 Study Design/Endpoints  
  
The study design for cohort A (patients who will be treated prior to tumor resection) is 
a two -stage trial with no stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_259325]. It will consist of a 
maximum of 20 total evaluable patients. The minimum pathologic tumor response 
rate that would warrant further study is 25%. The maximum pathologic tumor 
response rate (pRR) that would be uninteresting is 5%. The disease control rate is the 
rate not having progressive disease as d efined by [CONTACT_393] 1.1. criteria.  The 
pathologic response rate is determined by a tumor regression grade (TRG).  Both the 
RECIST radiology assessment (Eisenhauer et al. Eur J Cancer 2009;45: 228-247) and 
the TRG score (Thies et al. Front Oncol 2013;3:262) a re standard criteria applied for 
oncologic studies. If after the first [ADDRESS_315246] a pRR, the regimen will be recomm ended for further testing. If the 
regimen is inactive, there is a 51% chance that the trial will be stopped early.  
  
The study design for cohort B (patients with metastatic tumors with extended RAS 
(e.g. KRAS or NRAS) or BRAF mutations) is a two -stage tri al with no stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_259326]. A maximum of 25 evaluable patients will be accrued. The 
primary endpoint is the 3- month disease control rate (DCR). The minimum 3 -month 
DCR that would warrant further study is 30%. The maximum 3 -month DCR that 
would be uninteresting is 10%. If after the first [ADDRESS_315247] for further testing. If the true 3 -month DCR is 10% or less, 
the trial has a 51% chance of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_4428].  
  
The study design for cohort C is a traditional 3+3 dose escalation design. Sequential 
dose levels will accrue as per the following dosing schema.  
 
Protocol # [PHONE_5384]  
Version 8 Date:  08 March 2022   
    
Page 40   Dose level  Vit C dose per infusion 
(weekly monotherapy)  Vit C dose on  
Day of Y90 Rx  
Dose level 1  0.5 g/kg  0 
Dose level 2  0.75 g/kg  0 
Dose level 3  0.75 g/kg  0.5 g/kg  
Dose level 4  1.0 g/kg  0.5 g/kg  
Dose level 5  1.0 g/kg 0.75 g/kg  
Dose level 6  1.25 g/kg  0.75 g/kg  
 
  
The DLT observation period will start with the first vitamin C infusion prior to 
radioembolization and end after the last vitamin C infusion post-embolization. A DLT 
is defined as a grade 3+ (latest CTCAE version) adverse event that is at least possibly 
related to the vitamin C infusion. Three patients will be enrolled at dose level 0. 5 
g/kg. if there are no DLTs observed for this cohort, the next cohort of three wil be treated with 0.75 g/kg. If there is 1 DLT at the 0.5g/kg level out of three patients, 
three more patients will be enrolled at this dose. If no additional DLTs are observ ed (1 
of 6 patients with a DLT), the next three patients will be enrolled at the 0.75 g/kg 
level. If 2 or more out of 3 or 2 or more out of 6 experience a DLT at the 0.5 g/kg 
level, the trial will stop and it will be concluded the treatment has unacceptable 
toxicity. Dose escalations will continue if [ADDRESS_315248] 10 additiona l 
patients is planned at the recommended dose level (the dose immediate below the MTD, which is the dose level where 2 or more out of 3 or 6 patients experience a  
DLT).  If the MTD is not reached, the 1.25 g/kg will be the recommended dose level.  
  
   
12.2 Sample Size/Accrual Rate  
  
The primary objective for cohort A is to evaluate the pathological response rate  
(pRR). Based on historical data for patients with extended RAS (e.g. KRAS or  
NRAS) or BRAF mutations and preclinical activity of Vitamin C in extended RAS 
(e.g. KRAS or NRAS) or BRAF  mutant vs wild type colon cancer, the proposed null 
hypothesis (H0) is that the pRR for cohort A patients is ≤ 5%.  The alternative hypothesis (Ha) is that the pRR is ≥ 25% after treatment with Vitamin C 
supplementation in cohort A patients. This assumes a pRR of >40% extended RAS 
(e.g. KRAS or NRAS) or BRAF mutated cancers and 5% in wild type, and a 50% rate 
of extended RAS (e.g. KRAS or NRAS) or BRAF cohort. A sample size of [ADDRESS_315249] one-sided significance of 0.1 and 90% power 
with the indicated null and alternative hypotheses and the proposed interim analysis. 
Protocol # [PHONE_5384]  
Version 8 Date:  [ADDRESS_315250] 8 vitamin C 
infusions prior to surgery, and T RG grading is available from surgery. Patients not 
fulfilling these requirements will be considered not evaluable and will be replaced. To account for patients who are not evaluable, the target accrual will be 22 patients.  
  
The primary objective for cohort B is to determine the 3 -month disease control rate 
(DCR). It is assumed that the 3 -month DCR for this patient cohort without any further 
treatment is 10% (proposed null hypothesis, H0) and that the 3-month DCR for patients with extended RAS (e.g. KR AS or NRAS) or BRAF mutant tumors will be 
30% or more when treated with high-dose vitamin C supplementation (alternative hypothesis Ha). A sample size of evaluable [ADDRESS_315251] a one-sided significance of 0.1 and power of 90%. Patients in Cohort B will be considered 
evaluable if they have [ADDRESS_315252] an accrual rate of 4.2 patients/months across the two cohorts over one 
year.   
  
The minimum sample size for cohort C is [ADDRESS_315253] 3 patients enrolled at dose level 0.5 g/kg. The maximum sample size 
is 34 patients and will occur if each dose level requires 6 patients be enrolled and 
there are 10 patients enrolled at the recommended dose (which would be 1.25 g/kg).  
  
12.[ADDRESS_315254] (comparing 
values for patients with tumo rs that had a pRR and those who did not). Molecular 
signature [CONTACT_92925] C efficacy will be determined using RNA sequencing and compared between extended RAS (e.g. KRAS or NRAS) or BRAF mutant vs wild 
type tumors. Organoids will be prepared from resected tumor samples and treated 
with vitamin C. Change of organoid growth from baseline will be compared in 
extended RAS (e.g. KRAS or NRAS) or BRAF mutant vs. wild type tumors by [CONTACT_746] a two -sample t -test of the area under the growth curves. A comparisons o f 
pRR between patients with extended RAS (e.g. KRAS or NRAS) or BRAF mutated tumors (cohort A) will be done using a Fisher’s exact test. Finally there will be 
comparisons of the endpoints done for tumors with SUV < 10 versus tumors with 
SUV ≥ 10 and with GLUT1 IHC0/1 versus 2+/3+. The PFS of patients in cohirt B will be summarized with a Kaplan -Meier curve. For discrete endpoints (i.e. tumor 
response) the comparison will be done with Fisher’s exact test and for time to event

rank test.  
  
The adverse events will be tabulated as the frequency and relative frequency by [CONTACT_259353]. Tumor responses will be evaluated using RECIST criteria. A patient will 
have a tumor response if they have a complete or partial response. The tumor response rate will be estimated for across all enrolled patients as well as by [CONTACT_15994]. 
Tumor response will be reported a binomial point estimate and 95% confidence

This study will be monitored by [CONTACT_259354]. All adverse events 
will be summarized and reported to the DSMB. The study team will review AEs on a 
monthly basis via a report generated by [CONTACT_4305]. Treatment will be mo dified 
for individual patients according to the dose -modifications described in section 6. Patients 
will discontinue protocol treatment for reasons described in Section 5, including treatmentrelated toxicities which result in a delay of planned curative su rgery.   
  
The study will begin with recruitment of six patients in cohort B. If after at least [ADDRESS_315256] been accrued, the study will 
be temporarily suspended for cohort A patients if 20% or more of patients experience a 
grade 3+ AE that requires a delay of surgery for 1 week or longer. Upon review of the events and discussion with the IRB and DSMB, a decision will be made whether to reopen

if 25% or more of patients thereafter experience a grade 3+ AE . Upon review of the events 
and discussion with the IRB and DSMB, a decision will be made whether to reopen the study as is,  modify the study and reopen, or permanently close the study to cohort A 
patients.   
  
There are not planned interim analyses for this trial. The primary endpoint data for each 
cohort will be summarized and presented to the DSMB for review.  
  
For cohort C, the study team will determine whether doses can be escalated. All escalation 
decisions and observed AEs will be reported to the DSMB as part of the routine DSMB

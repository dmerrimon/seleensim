Clinical Study Protocol INK128- [ADDRESS_363718]: 2009 -017284-42
5Overview of Study Design:   This is a phase 1, open -label study that consists of a dose es calation 
phase in subjects with advanced malignancies, followed by [CONTACT_298303] 80 additional response -evaluable subjects with measurable disease in 2 dosing schedules in 2 
tumor -specific cohorts.
Up to 4 different dos ing schedules will be explored in the dose escalation phase:  once daily (QD), 
once weekly (QW), once daily for 3 days on, 4 days off repeated each week (QD 3d QW), and once 
daily for 5 days on, 2 days off repeated each week (QD 5d QW).  Enrollment will st art with the once 
daily schedule.  Once the MTD for this schedule is identified, enrollment will begin in parallel in the 
alternate dosing schedules.  Once the MTD has been identified for each of the 4 dosing schedules 
evaluated, an additional 6 subjects m ay be enrolled in 1 or more of the dosing schedule(s) to gain 
further PK and safety data to determine the recommended dose(s) and schedule(s) prior to the 
expansion phase of the study.
Based on biochemical data, available PK, and tolerability data for each MLN0128 dosing schedule, 
along with potential early signs of anti -tumor activity from subjects treated during the dose 
escalation phase, 1 or more dosing schedules will be evaluated for safety and efficacy, in parallel, in 
the expansion phase.  A total of up to 80 response -evaluable subjects will comprise 2 tumor -specific 
cohorts:  an RCC cohort and a cohort of selected tumor types (endometrial and bladder cancers).
Number of subjects planned:   Dose escalation phase –approximately 90 subjects; Expansion phase 
–approximately 80 response -evaluable subjects

(TORC1/2), or TORC1/2 inhibitors.
Other considerations for exclusion: Subjects taking moderate/strong CYP1A2 inhibitors, moderate 
CYP1A2 and/or strong and moderate CYP3A4 inducers should be considered with caution. 
Alternative treatments that are less likely to affect MLN0128 metabolism, if available, should be 
considered. If a subject requires treatment with 1 or more moderate/strong CYP1A2 inhibitor, a 
moderate/strong CYP1A2 and/or a strong CYP3A4 inducer, the medical monitor should be 
consulted. Examples of clinically relevant moderate/strong CYP1A2 inhibitors and inducers, as well 
as strong CYP3A4 inducers, are presented in Table 21.2.
Investigational Product(s), Dose, Route, and Regimen
MLN0128 ( also kn own as TAK -228 and INK128) is supplied in tamper -resistant, high -density 
polyethylene bottles as capsules containing [ADDRESS_363734] should take all the capsules orally for a given dose 
with a meal once in the morning for the QD, QW, QD 3d QW, and QD 5d QW dosing schedules.  
On each clinic day, the subject should return the study medication bottle and any unused study drug.  
A full accountability by [CONTACT_298304]’s designated Clinical Research Associate 
(CRA) should be conducted before these supplies are destroyed.
Cycles occur in [ADDRESS_363735] to study a dose level that is intermediate to the 
current dose level and the nex t lower dose level previously studied, eg 6 mg as an intermediate dose 
between 4 mg and 7 mg.  The level of dose escalation and a decision to go to an intermediate dose 
level will be determined after discussion between the participating investigators and M illennium’s 
medical monitor before dose escalation, but will not exceed the planned dose according to a 
modified Fibonacci schema.
After the MTD has been determined for the once daily dosing schedule (MTDqd), study of the 
additional dosing schedules will begin.  Enrollment will be initiated in parallel and independent 
arms:  Arm A with once weekly (QW) dosing starting at a dose not to exceed twice the MTDqd; 
ArmB with MLN0128 administered once daily for 3 days on, 4 days off each week (QD 3d QW) 
starting a t the MTDqd; and Arm C with MLN0128 administered once daily for 5 days on, 2 days off 
each week (QD 5d QW) starting at a dose not to exceed the total weekly dose of the MTDqd
(eg,≤42 mg).  Subjects will be randomly assigned to 1 of the 3 alternate dosing arms in the event ,
that 2 or more arms are open for enrollment at the same time.  Subjects may not participate in more 
than 1 dosing arm.
Dose escalation for each of the arms will be according to a modified Fibonacci schema.  The extent 
of dose escalation will be determined after discussion between the participating investigators and 
Millennium’s medical monitor prior to dose escalation, but will not exceed the planned dose 
according to a modified Fibonacci schema.
Duration of Treatment:   In the absence o f unacceptable MLN0128 treatment -related toxicity or 
disease progression, subjects may receive MLN0128 treatment for up to 1 year at the discretion of 
the investigator and beyond 1 year with the agreement of the investigator and the sponsor.

10Criteria for Evaluation
Safety :  Safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_22244], 12-lead electrocardiograms 
(ECGs), clinical laboratory assessments, in-home monitoring of glucose levels with a glucometer,
and monitoring of adverse events (AEs).  Adverse events will be graded using National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0.  Site teleconferences between the sponsor and all participating sites will be held approximately every 1 to 
2 weeks during the dose escalation phase to discuss any suspected AEs/DLTs that have occurred 
with each cohort.  Participating investigators and the sponsor’s medical monitor will review toxicities from the current cohort during the site teleconferences before escalating to the next dose 
level, expanding the cohort at the current dose level or exploring an intermediate dose level.
Pharmacokinetics :  The PK profile will be assessed by [CONTACT_298305]0128 
at intervals throughout the study.  Blood samples for PK profile will be collected in subjects enrolled 
in the dose escalation phase of the study at the following time points:
!Cycle 1, Day 1 (C1D1):  predose, 0.5 hour (± 15 min), 1 hour (± 15 min), 2 hours 
(± 30 min), 4 hours (± 30 min), 8 hours (± 30 min) post-C1D1 dose;
!Cycle 1, Day 2 (C1D2 = 24 ± [ADDRESS_363738]-C1D1 dose):  predose;
!Cycle 2, Day 1 (C2D1):  predose, 0.5 hour (± 15 min), 1 hour (± 15 min), 2 hours 
(± 30 min), 4 hours (± 30 min), 8 hours (± 30 min) post-C2D1 dose;
!Cycle 2, Day 2 (C2D2 = 24 ± [ADDRESS_363739]-C2D1 dose):  predose
During the expansion phase, PK samples will be obtained according to the schedule provided in 
Table 3-5.
Pharmacodynamics :  Throughout the study, pharmacodynamic assessment will be made by 
[CONTACT_298306] (PBCs) (dose escalation phase only), skin and tumor biopsies pre- and posttreatment whenever possible.  During dose 
escalation, the pharmacodynamic effect of MLN0128 activity in surrogate tissues (skin and tumor tissue) as measured by 4EBP1, AKT, and S6, as well as in peripheral blood cells via 4EBP1 will be evaluated. 
 
Blood samples for PBCs will be collected in all subjects at the following time points during the dose 
escalation phase of the study:
!Cycle 1, Day 1 (C1D1):  predose, 2 hours (± 30 min), 8 hours (± 30 min) post-C1D1 dose, and
!Cycle 1, Day 2 (C1D2 = 24 ± [ADDRESS_363740]-C1D1 dose):  predose, and
!Cycle 2, Day 1 (C2D1):  predose, 2 hours (±30 min), 8 hours (±30 min) post-C2D1 dose, and
!Cycle 2, Day 2 (C2D2 = 24 ± [ADDRESS_363741]-C2D1 dose):  pre-dose, and
!Termination visit
The previously mentioned biomarkers are downstream effectors of mTOR and have been used for 
determining the sensitivity of proliferative diseases to treatment with mTOR inhibitors.  The changes 
in biomarkers levels will be determined via flow cytometry and/or immunohistochemical analysis.  The absolute and percent change from baseline will be calculated for each subsequent measurement.  Summary statistics will be computed for each collection time point.CCI

11Predictive Markers of MLN0128 Activity :  Candidate somatic genetic markers that may predict 
MLN0128 activity will be evaluated in archival tumor tissues.  These include phosphoinositide 3-
kinase alpha catalytic subunit (PI3KCA), PTEN, and rat sarcoma (K/H/N) [Ras (K/H/N)] in archival paraffin tumor tissue with MLN0128 activity.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Efficacy :  Radiographic and/or physical assessments of the malignancy, and evaluations of relevant 
tumor markers (eg, cancer antigen 125 [CA125], prostate-specific antigen [PSA], cancer antigen 
19-9 [CA19-9], cancer antigen 27.29 [CA27.29], cancer antigen 15.3 [CA15.3], and 
carcinoembryonic antigen [CEA]) will be made at screening/baseline (within [ADDRESS_363744] study drug administration) and after every 2 cycles of treatment (or at intervals of up to every 4 cycles for long-term patients [ie, study participation ≥3 years], as clinically indicated based on the 
investigator’s judgment).  Objective response (complete response [CR] and partial response [PR]) as 
determined by [CONTACT_423]’s best tumor response, duration of response, and time to progression will 
be assessed using RECIST version 1.1.  A confirmatory CT/MRI scan should be performed at approximately 4 weeks from the previous scan for all subjects with an objective response of ≥ PR.  
The duration of stable disease will be evaluated for subjects with the best response of stable disease.
Statistical Methods
Safety Analyses :  Safety data analysis will be conducted on all subjects receiving at least [ADDRESS_363745] of data summaries for clinical and laboratory parameters, and for 
AEs.  The safety data from the dose escalation phase will be summarized by [CONTACT_298307], and by [CONTACT_298308].  For each study phase, the number 
and percentage of subjects experiencing 1 or more AEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_298309] v4.0.  Adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) terminology.  Laboratory parameters will be 
summarized using descriptive statistics, by [CONTACT_298310], and data listings of 
clinically significant abnormalities.  Vital signs and ECG data will be summarized by [CONTACT_22247].
Efficacy and Pharmacodynamic Analyses :  Efficacy analyses will be conducted for the response-
evaluable subjects enrolled in the expansion cohorts.  The results of these analyses will be 
summarized for the renal cohorts.  If there is a sufficient number of subjects with a specific tumor type, in the multi-tumor type cohort (ie, endometrial and bladder), then efficacy endpoints will also 
be summarized by [CONTACT_44847].  The number and percentage of subjects experiencing objective 
response (CR and PR) will be summarized.  The duration of objective response will be summarized descriptively using the Kaplan-Meier method.  For subjects with best response of stable disease, the 
duration of stable disease will be defined as the number of days from the date of first dose to the date 
of progressive disease.  Summary statistics will be provided for the duration of MLN0128 therapy versus the duration of the last systemic anticancer therapy received on subjects whose last systemic 
anticancer therapy prior to entering the study was not an investigational agent.  Summary statistics 
will be computed for baseline biomarkers.  The absolute and percent change from baseline will be calculated for each subsequent measurement.  Summary statistics will be computed for each collection time point.CCI

356.   INTRODUCTION
MLN0128 (also known as TAK -228 and INK128) is a potent and highly select ive, 
adenosine triphosphate (ATP) -competitive inhibitor of the serine/threonine kinase termed 
the mechanist ic (formerly, m ammalian) target of rapamycin (mTOR).  MLN0128 is 
mechanist ically dist inct from the allo steric inhibi tors of  mTOR (rapamycin and its 
derivat ives, referred to as rapalogs).  The rapalogs inhibit mTOR complex 1 only; this is 
distinct fro m MLN0128 t hat inhibits both mTOR complex 1 (TORC1) and mTOR complex 
2 (TORC2).  MLN0128 is formulated as capsules intended for the treatment of so lid and 
hematol ogic malignancies.
A co mprehensive review of MLN0128 is contained in the Invest igator’s Brochure (IB) 
supplied by  [CONTACT_298314], Inc. (Millennium).  The invest igator should 
review this docum ent before init iating this study.

and safet yof MLN0128 in bi ological models to characteri ze pharmacodynamics, define the 
pharmacokinet ic (PK) properties, characterize the toxicit y profile, and support a safe starting 
dose in humans for MLN0128 drug product.
The pharmaco logy studi es conducted wi th MLN0128 i dentified i t as an orally act ive, potent, 
and selective inhibitor of the serine/threonine protein kinase mTOR in both cellular 
signaling com plexes, TORC1 and TORC2.  In a biochemical assay, MLN0128 inhibited 
mTOR wi th a concentrati on inhibit ing enz yme act ivity by 50% (IC 50) of 1.[ADDRESS_363812] the closely structural -related phosphoinositol -3-kinases (PI3Ks), the 
MLN0128 IC 50values were increased more than [ADDRESS_363813] ivity window.  In cellular models, MLN0128 displayed inhibit ion of TORC1/2 
signaling pathways wit h IC 50s less than 10 nM.  In human tumor mouse xenograft models of 
a wide range o f tissue ty pes and varying genetic backgrounds, such as glio blastom a (U87), 
non
-small  cell lung cancer (A 549), breast cancer (ZR -75-1), renal cell cancer (786 -O), and 
endo metrial cancer (AN3 -CA), MLN0128 inhibited pharmacodynamic (PD) markers of 
TORC1/2 pathways that correlate with strong tumor growth inhibit ion in a specific and 
dose-dependent manner.  Treat ment with MLN0128 si gnificantly ameliorated tumor growth 
in mice at well -tolerated doses.
Secondary  pharm acology studi es using commercial, in vitro receptor binding assays 
revealed MLN0128 had affinit y for binding 2 adenosine receptors at concentrations

36(~10μM) well above expected therapeutic drug concentrations.  Similarly, MLN0128 
displayed l ow potenti al (IC 50= 175 µM) to affect the human ether -a-go- go related (hERG) 
potassi um channel , and displayed no effect on electrocardiograms obtained from consciou s 
telemeteri zed m onkeys.  Based on this profile, the ant icipated risk for clinically deleterious 
cardi ovascular effects i s considered low.
MLN0128 displayed consistent and predictable pharmacokinet ic parameters across mouse, 
rat, dog, and cynomo lgus monkey.  It was rapi[INVESTIGATOR_298273] (time of first 
maximum plasma concentration [T max] ranged from 0.25 hr -6.0 hr), showed high oral 
bioavailabilit y (30% -91%) and dose -proportional plasma exposures.  Plasma to brain 
concentration ratios o f 5-to 10 -fold in the mouse indicated a moderate propensit y for 
MLN0128 to cross the blood -brain barrier. MLN0128 was modestly bound (70.5%) to 
human plasma proteins.  Allo metri c scaling of the animal data to human predicts a low 
clearance (CL ~ 2.1 m L/mi n/kg), a small vol ume of distribut ion (V ss~ 1.2 L/kg), and a 
plasma half -life (t 1/2) amenable to once -daily administration (t 1/2~ 15-30 hr).
Multiple phase I/II m etabo lic pathways, including hydroxylation and glucuronidat ion, have 
been ident ified for MLN 0128.  The metabolites generated in human microsomal incubat ions 
were al so observed in rats and monkeys, the species studied in Good Laboratory  Practi ce 
(GLP) toxico logy studi es.  The dog (either in vitro or in vivo) did not produce any  phase I 
metabo litesformed in human microsom al incubations.
The human cytochro me P450 (CYP) isoforms CYP3A4, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 contribute 
to MLN0128 metabo lism.  MLN0128 displayed low potential (IC 50≥ 30 µM) as a direct 
inhibitor of the major human CYP iso forms (CYP1A2, C YP3A4, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, 
CYP2C19, and CYP2D6).  Recently co mpleted in vitro metabo lism experiments in human 
hepatocy tes using 14C
-labeled MLN0128 suggest that MLN0128 is metabo lized primarily 
via CYP1A2 (approximately 31%- 40%), wi th a minor contribut ion from CYP3A4 
(approximately 11%- 22%).  These data suggest that MLN0128 is also metabo lized by [CONTACT_298315] (approximately 22%) and an unident ified non-CYP, non-uridine 
diphosphate gl ucuronosyltransferase pathway  (approximately 18%).  The new data diff er 
from the previous in vitro CYP phenoty pi[INVESTIGATOR_53280], 
which suggested the invo lvement of CYP2C9 (approximately 35%), CYP2C19 
(approximately 28%), and CYP3A4 (approximately 28%) in MLN0128 m etabo lism.  
MLN0128 does not i nhibit or induce any of the major CYP enzymes.  In addit ion, 
physio logically based PK modeling and simulat ion using the new metabo lism data for 
MLN0128 suggest that the risk for a metabo lism-based drug- drug interaction with

37MLN0128 appears to be low.  Ther efore, strong CYP1A2 inhibitors and CYP inducers ( see 
Secti on21.2) should only  be administered wi th cauti on and at the discretion of the 
investigat or during the study .
The MLN0128 toxico logy program  consisted of oral  single -dose studi es in rats, dogs, and 
monkeys, repeat -dose studies in rats (non -GLP 4- day, non -GLP 14- day, and GLP 28 -day 
with 14 days recovery ) and m onkeys (non -GLP 14 -day and GLP 28 -day with 14 days 
recovery ), a GLP cardi ac safet y pharmaco logy study  in telemeteri zed m onkeys, and a GLP 
Ames assay.  MLN0128 freebase drug substance (Form A) was used in all these studies and 
will be used in phase 1 clinical studies.
In dogs and monkeys, cl inical  signs were observed fo llowing single intravenous and oral 
doses of MLN0128.  Dogs received an intravenous (IV) dose of 1 mg/kg (20 mg/m2) or an 
oral (PO) dose of 3 m g/kg (60 m g/m2); all animals were euthanized in extremis at [ADDRESS_363816]
-mortem gross examinat ions defined all tissues 
within norm al limits.  In the m onkey , IV and PO doses were administered at 1 mg/kg 
(12mg/m2) and 3 m g/kg (36 m g/m2), respect ively; all animals displayed clinical signs o f 
emesis, decreased act ivity, and decreased food intake.  Clinical signs persisted up to [ADDRESS_363817] ing of heat lamps, subcutaneous fluids, and suppleme ntal 
food offerings (fruits and vegetables) appeared to aid in the resolution of clinical signs.  
Animals recovered by [ADDRESS_363818] Non -Severely Toxic Do se (HNSTD) of 
0.15 mg/kg/day (1.8 mg/m2/day) in m onkeys by  7 to 33 -fold.
The toxi city profiles in rats from  the 14 -day and 28 -day studi es were consistent.  In the 
28day repeat -dose with 14 -day recovery  rat study , dose -related increases in toxicit y were 
observed; no effects at 0.3 mg/kg/day  (1.8 m g/m2/day), no si gnificant adverse effects at 
1.0mg/kg/day (6.0 mg/m2/day), and mild to moderate effects at 3 mg/kg/day  
(18mg/m2/day).
The effects seen at the 3.0 -mg/kg/day dose were 26% body weight decreases as compared to 
control s.  Clinically  significant changes observed in clinical chemistry  parameters wi th 
increases in aspartate aminotransferase, glucose, and insulin; decreases in le ukocy tes,

levels, demo nstrating reversibilit y of MLN0128 induced toxicit ies in the rat.  Based on the 
data from  the 28 -day, repeat -dose, rat study, the dose of 3 mg/kg/day (18 mg/m2/day) was 
considered the rodent STD 10(severely toxic dose to 10% of rats).
In the 28- day, repeat- dose, GLP, cynomo lgus monkey  study , MLN0128 toxicit ies were dose 
related and were ei ther absent or tended toward normal at the end of the 14- day recovery 
period.  The hi gh dose (0.3 m g/kg/day  [3.6 m g/m2/day]) resul ted in severe toxi cities that l ed 
to the m oribund sacrifice of 2 monkeys, discont inuation of dosing, and the end of study 
assessments on Day  19.  MLN0128- related effects observed at the high dose included 
clinical signs o f 10% body  weight decreases as compared to baseline, decreased appetite, 
abnorm al posture, decreased activit y, and decreased body  temperature.  Clinical chemistry  
changes were increases in aspartate aminotransferase, creatinine kinase (MM isoform), 
cholesterol , triglycerides, and insulin; and decreases in sodium, potassium, and phosphorus.  
Hem atology parameter al terati ons were decreases in lymphocy tes and increases in 
neutrophils and monocy tes.  Mil der effects were o bserved at 0.15 mg/kg/day  
(1.8mg/m2/day).  The l ow dose (0.05 m g/kg/day  [0.6 m g/m2/day]) produced only  some 
instances of test -article related organ weight changes; weight decreases in thymus 
(stati stically significant) and in spleen, and weight increases in adrenals.
Histopathol ogical changes at the 0.15 -mg/kg/day and 0.3 -mg/kg/day doses were seen in the 
thymus, spleen, lymph nodes, gut- associ ated lympho id tissue, bone marrow, adrenal glands, 
salivary glands, gastrointest inal tract, skin, and epi[INVESTIGATOR_26612].   In the recovery  animals, 
findings were limited to the thymus (minimal to mild lympho id depletion).  Specific 
MLN0128 -related microscopic findings in the lympho id organs, including gut -associ ated 
lympho id tissue, were mult icentric lympho id depletion and s plenic red pul p deplet ion.  At 
the high dose, the spleen had moderate to severe deplet ion of red blood cells and 
hematopoiet ic cells.  In bone marrow, minimal to moderate mixed cell deplet ion was seen.  
In adrenals, minimal to moderate bilateral cortical h ypertrophy /hyperplasia was evident.  In

In the recovery  monkeys, test article -related findings of minimal to mild lymphoid deplet ion 
were limited to thymus in females at 0.15 mg/kg/day  and in both sexes at 0.30 mg/kg/day.

6.3   Study Rationale
The m TOR is a kinase that regulates cell growth, translat ional contro l, angiogenesis, and 
cell survival by [CONTACT_259780].  mTOR plays a key  role in several 
pathways that are frequent ly dysregulated in human cancer.(2)  The mTOR act ivity in the

42intracellular signaling co mplexes (TORC1 and TORC2) is an important therapeutic target 
because (i) it is a key  intracellular point of convergence for a number of cellul ar signaling 
pathways; (ii) it appears to be a stable target that does not mutate; (iii) inhibit ing m TOR may  
inhibit abnormal cell pro liferat ion, tum or angi ogenesis, and abnormal cellular metabo lism.  
Thus, m TOR inhibitors may  be effective as single agents and may  enhance the efficacy of 
other cancer treatments.
mTOR operates in [ADDRESS_363839] mult i-protein com plexes, TORC1 and TORC2.  TORC1, 
stimulated by  [CONTACT_231926], regulates cell growth by  [CONTACT_298316] y of the ribosom al protein S6 (S6) ki nases and eukary otic initiation factor 4 binding 
proteins (4EBPs).(3)  Rapamycin (Rapamune®) is a TORC1 inhibitor that has been approved 
for prophylaxis of organ rej ection in subjects receiving renal transplants.  Although 
rapamycin has been shown to possess so me antitumor activit y, its poor aqueous sol ubilit y 
and chemical stabilit y has precluded its utilization at doses necessary  for anti cancer 
treatm ent.  Thi s led to the development of new rapalogs.  Those currently in clinical 
development as ant icancer agents include temsirolimus (cell cycle inhibitor -779 or 
CCI-779), everolimus (RAD -001), and deforolimus (AP23573).  These agents have 
demonstrated anti proliferat ive activit y against a range of malignancies in preclinical studies 
and clinical evaluat ions have revealed some encouraging data in selected disease 
popul ations.  In 2007, temsiro limus (Torisel®) was approved by  [CONTACT_298317] (US) Food 
and Dru g Administrati on (FDA) for treatm ent of advanced renal cell cancer and, in March 
2009, everolimus (Afinitor®) was approved for treatment of advanced renal cancer after 
failure of treatment with sunit inib or sorafenib.(4, 5)  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_298276], 
the rapalogs have limitat ions and efficacy may be confined to dist inct subject subt ypes or 
diseases.  There are several scien tific hypotheses that may explain the limited success of 
rapal ogs.  Inhibit ion of TORC1 (without inhibit ion of TORC2) leads to activat ion of 
serine/threonine protein kinase B (AKT) due to a feedback mechanism, and this 
upregul ation of AKT may actually acce lerate tumor progression, thus limit ing the clinical 
efficacy  of rapal ogs.(6)
Additionally , TORC2 phosphorylates AKT which is required for full act ivity of AKT.  
Activated AKT is invo lved in cancer cell survival, proliferat ion, growth, metabo lism, 
angiogenesis, and metastasis.  Inhibit ion of AKT activit y through TORC2 inhibit ion has 
been expl ored f or anti cancer therapeuti cs and preclinical invest igations have shown 
inhibit ion of TORC2 blocks cancer growth.(7)  TORC2 inhibit ion can also reverse the 
activat ion of AKT induced by  [CONTACT_298318]1 inhibi tion.  Therefore, m TOR inhibitors tha t target

43both m TOR com plexes such as MLN0128 may  achieve greater clinical efficacy  than 
rapal ogs.(8)
To date, INK128- 001 has evaluated in QD, QW, QD 3d QW, and QD 5d QW dosing 
schedules in subjects with advanced malignancies.
The PI3K/mTOR pathway  is central  to a number of vital cellular functions, such as cell 
growth, translat ional control, angiogenesis, and survival.   Dysregulat ion of this pathway  has 
been implicated in many  types of  human cancers.(2)  In the expansio n phase, pat ients with 
the following tum or types will be enrolled based on the recognized importance of the 
PI3K/mTOR pathway in each:  renal, endometrial, and bladder.  The significance of the 
PI3K/mTOR pathway in each of these tumor ty pes is presented in the followi ng.
Renal Cancer :  mTOR controls cell growth, proliferation, and survival and plays a crit ical 
role in the pathogenesis o f renal cell carcino ma (RCC).(9)  mT OR frequent ly shows 
alterati ons in the mTOR signaling pathway, either increasing mTOR activit y or, depending 
on m TOR act ivation for thei r oncogenic potential, mTOR controls production of HIF -1, an 
important protein in RCC , where i ts unregulated activit y is causally  related to disease 
pathogenesis.(
10)  The HIF transcript ion factors drive the expressio n of hypoxic stress 
response genes, which include angiogenic growth factors, such as VEGF, PDGF -, TGF -, 
and Ang -1.  PTEN is frequent ly lost in RCC, which st imulates mTOR activit y through 
enhancement of t he PI3K/AKT pathway.  Loss of PTEN is correlated with survival and 
indicates a poorer prognosis.(11)  Two partial TORC1 inhibitors, temsiro limus and 
evero limus, have already been approved for the treatment of RC C.  MLN0128 i s a potent 
inhibitor of TORC1 and TORC2.  It shows strong inhibit ion of RCC cells regardless o f their 
genet ic backgrounds.  MLN0128 also displays potent ant i-tumor efficacy in various 
preclinical RCC tumor models.(12)
Endometrial Cancer :  The PI3K pathway  is frequent ly hyper -activated in endo metrial cancer 
through various PI3K/AKT act ivating mutations (such as phosphatase and tensin ho molog 
[PTEN] and phospho inosit ide-3-kinase alpha cataly tic subuni t [PIK3CA]).(13)  The finding 
of PTEN m utations in 40% to 60% of endometrial cancers and PIK3CA mutations in 23%, 
sugg ests thi s pathway is important in the pathogenesis of this disease.(14)  Loss of PTEN 
leads to constitutive act ivation o f AKT, which in turn leads to up -regulat ion of mTOR.  The 
PIK3CA mutations are nonsyno nymous missense mutations that confer const itutive kinase 
activit y rendering the PI3K/mTOR pathway hyperactivated.  MLN0128 potently inhibit s 
proliferat ion of endo metrial cells wi th PTEN and PI3Kα mutations in vitro.  It displays

Bladder Cancer :  PI3K/m TOR pathway  activati on is invo lved in bladder cancer 
tumorigenesis and development.  This pathway can be activated by  [CONTACT_298319].  
PI3K -α mutation is detected in about 25% of bladder cancers.(17)  Over 10% of bladder 
cancers show mutations in PTEN and TSC1 genes.(17)  The expressio n of pAkt, p4EBP1, an d 
pS6 is significant ly higher in high -grade and advanced- stage bladder cancers and is 
associ ated wi th poorer prognosis.(18, 19)  Rapalogs have been shown to inhibit bladder cancer 
cell proliferat ion and induce apoptosis in vitro, and inhibit bladder tumor growth in mouse 
models.(20, 21)  MLN0128, which more potently inhibit s pAKT and p4EBP1 than rapalogs, 
could be explo ited as a potential therapeut ic strategy  in bladder cancer.

8.1   Overall Study Design and Plan
This is a phase 1, open -label study  that consists of a dose escalati on phase in subjects with 
advanced malignancies, fo llowed by [CONTACT_28726] n phase of safet y and efficacy  in up to 
80additional response -evaluable subjects with measurable disease.  Up to 4 different dosing 
schedules will be explored in the dose escalat ion phase:  QD, once weekly (QW), 
QDx3d QW, and QDx5d QW.  Enrollment will start with the once daily  schedule.  Once the 
MTD for this schedule is ident ified, enro llment will begin in parallel in the alternate dosing 
schedules.  Once the MTD has been ident ified for each of the 4 dosing schedules evaluated, 
an addit ional 6 subjects may be enrolled in 1 or more of the dosing schedules to gain further 
PK and safety  data pri or to the expansio n phase o f the study .
Based on biochemical data, available PK, and tolerabil ity data f or each MLN0128 dosing 
schedule, along with potential early signs o f anti-tumor activit y from subjects treated during 
the dose escalat ion phase, 1 or more dosing schedules will be selected to be evaluated in the 
expansio n phase.  In the expansio nphase, the safety  and efficacy of 1 or more MLN0128 
treatm ent schedules will be evaluated in parallel in a renal tumor -specific cohort, as well as 
in cohorts of selected tumor ty pes (endo metrial and bladder cancers) for a total of 
80response -evaluable su bjects.
8.2   Dose Escalation Phase
Up to 4 different dosing schedules will be explored in the dose escalation phase:  QD, QW, 
QD 3d QW, and QD 5d QW.  The MTD for the QD schedule of MLN0128 in subjects 
with advanced so lid malignancies was determined to be 6 mg (MTDqd= 6 m g) on the basis 
of the ini tial evaluat ion of 6 subjects in this cohort.
After the MTD was determined for the once -daily dosing schedule (MTDqd= 6 m g), study  
of the addi tional dosing schedules began wit h implementation of Amendment 7.  Enro llment 
was init iated in 2 parallel and independent arms:  Arm A wit h once -weekly dosing starting 
at a dose not to exceed that of twice the MTDqd; and Arm B with MLN0128 administered 
QD 3d QW starting at the MTDqd.  Amendment 10 added a further dosing sched ule as 
noted, QD 5d QW.  Subjects are randomly assigned to an alternate dosing arm when all 
arms are open for enrollment at the same time.  Subjects may not participate in more than 1 
dosing arm.

Prevention/Prophylaxis
Follow fasting serum glucose levels during clinic visits.
Monitor home glucometer test results.
Check HbA1c levels ever y 3 mo nths during therapy.
Life-style modifications, as appropriate (balanced diet, limit alcohol consumption, increase 
physical activity).
Most epi[INVESTIGATOR_13368] 1 and 2 hyperglycemia respond quickly to oral metformin.
Early  initiation of therapy is recommended to prevent higher grade hyperglycemia.

55In the event that any  FSG reading performed at the site indicates hyperglycemia (> upper 
limit of normal [ULN] or ≥ 110 mg/dL), the study staff should first ascertain that the subject 
was fasting at the time of the blood draw (ie, nothing by [CONTACT_24314] 8 hours prior to 
blood being obtained), had continued to take their concomitant ant iglycemic medications 
shoul d the subject have underlying diabetes mellit us, and repeat the FSG as needed.  If the 
repeat FSG continues to demonstrate hy perglycemia, investigators shoul d initiate steps to 
aggressively  manage the hyperglycemia per standard clinical pract ice.  The fo llowing 
guidelines are provided to aid the invest igator in init iating ant iglycemic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].
Based on the clinical experience from MLN0128 trials, most epi[INVESTIGATOR_53288] [ADDRESS_363872] igator may choose either to 
continue close mo nitoring of subjects who develop Grade 1 hy perglycemia 
(FSG >ULN ≤160 m g/dL) or, al ternat ively, consider init iating treatment with an oral 
hypoglycemic agent, such as met formin.  All subjects with Grade ≥ 2 hy perglycemia 
(FSG >160 m g/dL) m ust be treated aggressively with oral hypoglycemic agents and/or 
insulin as clinically  indicated while cont inuing on MLN0128.  The in vestigator should 
consult an endocrino logist if needed to aid in optimizing the subject’s hyperglycemia 
treatm ent pl an.
It is recommended that subjects be treated init ially wi th a fast acting, insulin sensit izer, such 
as metformin at 500 mg PO QD, and titr ate up to a maximum of 1000 mg PO BID as 
needed.  Concurrent addition to met formin of DPP -4 inhibitors (eg, sitaglipt in or 
vildaglipt in) and/or insulin should also be considered.  Oral sulfo nylureas (eg, glipi[INVESTIGATOR_231905]) should be used with caut ion due to the higher risk of inducing hypoglycemia in 
subjects.  The dose of oral hypoglycemic agents should be adjusted in subjects with renal 
insufficiency.

8.9.7    Selection of Doses Used in the Study
The starting dose for the daily dosing schedule is 2 mg once daily .
The STD 10has been defined as 3 mg/kg/day (18 mg/m2/day) and the HNSTD in monkeys as 
0.15 m g/kg/day  (1.8 m g/m2/day).  Using the FDA endorsed paradigm for select ing the 
maximum starting dose in humans, 1 -tenth the rodent STD 10(ie, 1.8 mg/m2/day) was 
compared to the HNSTD in monkeys.(26)  Since 1/10th the STD 10in the rat was not severely 
toxic to the m onkey, 1/10th the STD 10in rats can be used as the maximum human starting 
dose.  A m aximum  human starti ng dose of 1.8 mg/m2/day for an average sized subject of 
1.7m2is calculated as 3 mg/day.  Recognizing that prior human experience does not exist 
with MLN0128 and allo metric s caling predicts a potential for drug accumulat ion in humans 
at steady  state, Millennium proposes the human starting dose be 2 mg/day (1.2 mg/m2/day).  
Based on preclinical data, it is estimated that a dose of 2 mg/day in humans could achieve 
systemic expos ures sufficient for bio logical inhibi tion of target.  Thus, thi s starti ng dose 
shoul d offer an opportuni ty for potenti al therapeut ic benefit while minimizing subject’s risk.
The starting doses of the addit ional dosing schedules to be evaluated will be base d on the 
MTD of the QD dosing schedule (MTDqd).  Arm  A, with once -weekly  dosing, will start at a 
dose not to exceed that of twice the MTDqd.  Arm  B, wi th MLN0128 being administered 
QD 3d QW, will start at the MTDqd; Arm C, with MLN0128 QD 5d QW, will start at a 
dose not to exceed the total weekly dose of the MTDqd(ie, ≤ 42 mg/week).  Dose escalat ion 
for the dosing schedules will be according to a modified Fibo nacci schema.  For example, 
the starting dose of [ADDRESS_363920] igators and Millennium’s medical monitor pri or to the dose 
escalat ion, but the dose selected will not exceed the planned dose according to a modified 
Fibonacci schema.
[IP_ADDRESS]    Selection of Timing of Dose for Each Subject
It is ant icipated that MLN0128 will possess a plasma half -life co mmensurate with once daily 
administration in humans.  Preclinical models o f efficacy, safety , and PK have l argely relied 
on once -daily dosing.  Invest igation of different dosing schedules in preclinical efficacy

9.1.2    Adverse Event Definition
Adverse event (AE) means any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or subject 
administered a pharmaceutical product; the untoward medical occurrence does not 
necessarily have a causal relat ionship wi th this treatm ent.  An AE can therefore be any  
unfavorable and unintended si gn (including an abnormal laboratory  finding), symptom, or 
disease tem porally associ ated wi th the use of a m edicinal (investigational) product whether 
or not i t is related to the medicinal product.  This includes any newly occurring event, or a 
previous co ndition that has increased in severit y or frequency since the administration of 
study  drug.
An abnormal laboratory  value will not be assessed as an AE unless that value leads to 
discontinuat ion or del ay in treatm ent, dose m odificati on, therapeuti c interven tion, or is 
considered by [CONTACT_2418] a clinically significant change from baseline.
9.1.3    Serious Adverse Event Definition
Serious AE (SAE) m eans any untoward medical occurrence that at any  dose:
Results in death.
Is life-threatening (refers to a n AE in which the patient or subject was at risk of 
death at the time of the event.  It does not refer to an event which hypothetically 
might have caused death if it were more severe).
Requi res inpat ienthospi[INVESTIGATOR_298290]
(see cl arificati on in the paragraph below on planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_24509]).
Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity . (Disabilit y is defined 
as a substant ial disrupt ion of a person’s abilit y to conduct normal life functions).

77Isa congenital anomaly/birth defect .
Is a medically important event .  This refers to an AE that may not result in death, 
be immediately  life threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3094], but may be considered 
serious when, based on appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the patient or 
subject, require medical or surgical intervent ion to prevent [ADDRESS_363936] ious 
agent.  Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring 
intensive treatm ent in an emergency  room  or at home, blood dyscrasias or 
convulsio ns that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug 
dependency  or drug abuse; any  organism, virus, or infect ious parti cle (e g, pri on 
protein transmitt ing transmissible spongiform encephalopathy), pathogenic or 
nonpathogenic, is considered an infect ious agent.
In thi s study , intensi ty for each AE, including any  lab abnormalit y, will be determined using 
the NCI CTCAE, Version 4.[ADDRESS_363937] ive date 14 June 2010.(27)  Clar ification should be 
made between a serious AE (SAE) and an AE that is considered severe in intensit y (Grade 3 
or 4), because the terms serious and severe are NOT synonymous.  The general term severe
is often us ed to describe the intensit y (severi ty) of a specific event; the event itself, however, 
may be of relat ively minor medical significance (such as a Grade 3 headache).  This is NOT 
the sam e as serious , which is based on patient/event outcome or action criter ia described 
above, and is usually associated with events that pose a threat to a patient’s life or abilit y to 
funct ion.  A severe AE (Grade 3 or 4) does not necessarily need to be considered serious.  
For example, a white blood cell count of 1000/mm3to less than 2000 is considered Grade 3 
(severe) but may not be considered serious.  Seriousness (not intensit y) serves as a guide for 
defining regulatory  reporti ng obligat ions.

10.1   Pharmacokinetics
The plasma concentrations for MLN0128 will be determined using a liquid chromatography 
tandem mass spectrometry method.  The measured MLN0128 plasma concentrations will be 
used to determine the PK parameters, including AUC, C max, Cmin, Tmax, and t 1/2.  
Comparisons across dose levels will be mad e to assess proportionality.  In addition, 
comparison between single dose and multi-dose PK parameters will be made for assessment of steady-state drug accumulation.
10.2   Biomarker Assessments
10.2.1    Pharmacodynamic Assessments
During the dose escalation phase, pharmacodynamic assessment will be made by [CONTACT_298336] (PBCs), skin and tumor biopsies pre- and post-treatment whenever po ssible.  The PD effect of MLN0128 activity in 
surrogate tissue (skin and tumor tissue) via 4EBP1, AKT, and S6 as well as peripheral blood 
cells (dose escalation only) via 4EBP1 will be evaluated.   
 
 
The afore mentioned biomarkers are downstream effectors of mTOR and have been used for 
determining the sensitivity of proliferative diseases to treatment with mTOR inhibitors.  The changes in biomarkers levels will be determined via flow cytometry and/or immunohistochemical analysis.  The absolute and percent change from baseline will be 
calculated for each subsequent measurement.  Summary s tatistics w ill be computed for each 
collection time point.
10.2.[ADDRESS_363947] MLN0128 activity will be evaluated in 
archival tumor tissues.  These include PI3KCA, PTEN, Ras (K/H/N) in archival paraffin tumor tissue with MLN0128 activity.CCI

For purposes of defining the MTD and/or expansion phase reco mmended dose(s) of 
MLN0128, subjects will be evaluated according to the actual starting dose of MLN0128 
during the first treatment cy cle.  For most subjects, this will be the dose cohort to which they  
were assigned.  Subjects who receive at least 75% of the planned doses in Cycle [ADDRESS_363957] sufficient safet y data/fo llow-up to support dose escalation.  Subjects who 
withdraw from study  before receiving 75% of the planned doses in the first cy cle of 
treatm ent for reasons unrelated to study  drug toxi city will be considered to have inadequate 
data to support dose escalat ion.  In such cases, replacement subjects may  be enrolled to

Object ive Response Rate
The obj ective response rate will be est imated for each tumor histology  type evaluated in the 
expansio n phase.  The estimate of the object ive response rate will be calculated based on the 
maximum likeli hood estimator (i e, crude proportion of subjects whose best overall response 
is CR or PR).  The estimate of the object ive response rate will be acco mpanied by 2 -sided 
95% exact bino mial confidence intervals.
Durati on of  Objective Response
The durati on of  objective response will be calculated for subjects who achieve CR or PR.  
For such subjects, the duration of object ive response is defined as the number of days fro m 
the start date of PR or CR (whichever response is achieved first) to the first date that 
progressive disease is object ively documented.  Disease progression will be determined by 
[CONTACT_298342] (version 1.1).  The duration of object ive response will be 
right-censored for subjects who achieve CR or PR and meet 1 of the fo llowing co nditions:  
1) non -protocol ant icancer treatment started before documentation of disease progression, 
2) death or documented disease progression after more than 1 missed disease assessment 
visit, or 3) alive and does not have documentation of disease progre ssion before a data 
analysis cutoff date.  For such subjects, the duration of object ive response will be right -
censored according to Table 12-1 below.  These convent ions are based on the May  2007 
FDA Guidance for Industry .‘(

subjects, up to a total of 12, may be enrolled in a given cohort and schedule to better 
understand the safet y profile and tol erabilit y of a particular dose level/dose schedule 
combinat ion.  Each subject will part icipate in only  1 dose cohort/dose schedule.  The total 
number of subjects to be enro lled in the dose escalation phase of th e study  is dependent 
upon the observed safet y profile, which will determine the number of subjects per dose 
cohort, as well as the number of dose escalations required to achieve the MTD for each dose 
schedule evaluated.
12.4.2    Expansion Phase
Based on safet y and available PK data of MLN0128 along with possible early signs of ant i-
tumor activit ies from subjects treated during the dose escalat ion phase, the expansio n phase 
of the study  will evaluate 1 or more populat ions (init ially 2) wi th measurable disease: re nal

[ZIP_CODE].4   Amendment 20Detailed Summary of Changes
The primary  secti on(s) of the protocol affected by [CONTACT_51280] 20 are 
indicated.  The correspond ing text has been revised throughout the protocol.
Change 1: Specify caut ionary use of  CYP1A2 inhibitors and CYP1A2 and Cyp3A4 
inducers as concomitant medicat ions.
The primary  change occurs in Section 8.9.9 , Prior and Conco mitant Medi cations.
Revised
text:Strong cy tochrom e CYP1A2 inhibitors, moderate CYP1A2 inducers, and strong 
and moderate CYP3A4 inducers should be administered with caution and at the 
discreti on of  the invest igator. Moderate and strong cytochrome CYP1A2 
inhibitors and moderate and strong CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 inducers should 
be administered with caution and at the discretion of the investigator.
Rationale for Change:
This change was made to address the use of moderate cy tochrom eCYP1A2 inhibitors and 
strong CYP1A2 inducers.
Change 2: Remove dietary restrict ions related to CYP inhibitors and inducers consistent ly 
within the protocol .
The primary  change occurs in the synopsis and exclusio n criteria to align with Sect ion8.11,
Dietary  or Other Protocol Restrict ions.
Deleted 
text: Subjects should not consume food or beverages containing the fruit or juice 
from grapefruits or Seville oranges within [ADDRESS_364012] dose of study  
drug.
Rationale for Change:
This change was made for consistency wit hin the pro tocol  with new data that remove the 
necessit y for restri ctions concerning CYP2C9 and 2C19.
Change 3 : Update FDA guidance link.
The primary  change occu rs in the footnote to Table 21-2.

Name [CONTACT_3261]: WT2725 
Title of Study: Initial Phase  1 Study of WT2725 Dosing Emulsion in Patients with Advanced 
Malignancies  
Study Center(s): Part 1: 4-8 clinical sites in the [LOCATION_002]  (US). Part  2: an additional 2 sites in the 
US may be  included.  
Phase of Development: 1 
Study Objectives:  
Primary:  
The primary objectives are:  
• to evaluate the safety and tolerability of WT2725 Dosing Emulsion 
• to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of WT2725 Dosing Emulsion based on 
the evaluation of  dose-limiting toxicity (DLT)  
Secondary:  
The secondary objectives are:  
• to describe antitumor responses to WT2725 Dosing Emulsion based on the immune- related 
response criteria (irRC) ( Wolchok-2009, Hoos-2010), modified International Working 
Group response c riteria in acute myeloid leukemia (IWG) ( Cheson-2003), and/or tumor 
markers 
• to evaluate the immune responses to WT2725 Dosing Emulsion based on a series of circulating biomarkers in peripheral blood, delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) to the 
WT2725 peptide, and immunohistochemistry in tumor tissue 
Other: 
The other objectives are:  
• to evaluate immune response by [CONTACT_713498]’ tumor gene product (WT1) pr otein 
expression in tumor cells 
• to obtain blood serum for future retrospective analyses of additional biomarkers  
Study Design: This is a Phase 1, open-label, dose- escalation , 2-part study in adult patients with 
advanced malignancies known to overexpress the WT1 protein. The study will primarily evaluate DLT 
and define the MTD of WT2725 Dosing Emulsion during the DLT Evaluation Period, which extends 
from the day of the first dose of study drug to just prior to the fifth dose (Days 1 - 29). In addition, 
antitumor activity and biomarkers indicative of immune response will be evaluated from the first dose 
until discontinuation of the patient from the study. An end of study assessment will take place within 
[ADDRESS_971064] one week apart to evaluate

initial safety from the first 2  patients, then a “rolling -six” design will be employed that allows accrual 
of [ADDRESS_971065] cohort, enrollment of subsequent patients will be conducted sequentially in 
subsequent cohorts and continue until the MTD or all planned cohorts are attained.  Enrollment of each 
cohort may include patients with any of the eligible tumor types (see below). Enrollment of the highest 
tolerable dose cohort (MTD or highest planned cohort) will continue until there are at least 6 patients 
total in the study with each  tumor type that are evaluable for DLT, biomarkers, and response. This dose 
is considered the reco mmended phase 2 dose (RP2D). Enrollment of up to [ADDRESS_971066] 
been established for the 18.0 mg cohort, enrollment of subsequent patients will be conducted 
sequentially in the 27.0 mg  cohort. Approximately 10 patien ts at each dose level (18.0 and 27.0 mg) 
with at least 4  patients with each malignancy type (glioblastoma and acute myeloid leukemia [AML]) 
will be enrolled at each of these dose levels.  If the MTD is reached in Part  [ADDRESS_971067] not experienced a DLT, ≥ Grade  [ADDRESS_971068] been established. The expected time to enroll each dose escalation cohort (2 – 6 patients) is between 6 and 12 weeks.  
Each part of the study will include 3 treatment phases based on intended timing of study drug dosing as 
indicated below: 
Part 1: 
• Vaccine Induction Phase: once every 7 days for 4  weeks (doses 1  - 5) 
• Consolidation Phase: once every 14 days for 6 weeks (doses 6 - 9) 
• Maintenance Phase: once every 28  days until discontinuation (dose 10 and thereafter)  
Part 2: 
• Vaccine Induction Phase: once every 7  days for 8 weeks (doses 1 - 9) 
• Consolidation Phase: once every 14  days for 10 weeks (doses 10 – 15 [maximum of 
6 doses]) 
• Maintenance Phase: once every 28  days until discontinuation (dose 16 and thereafter)  
Number of Patients (planned): Approximately  60-80 patients total in Parts  1 and 2 
Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion: Part 1: Adult patients with one of the following

Name [CONTACT_791]: WT2725 Dosing Emulsion 
Name [CONTACT_3261]: WT2725 
The determination of the MTD of WT2725 Dosing Emulsion will be based on the incidence of DLT at 
each dose level and the overall safety profile of WT2725 Dosing Emulsion. The incidence of DLT will 
be evaluated during the DLT Evaluation Period, which extends from the day of the first dose to just 
prior to the fifth dose of study drug (Days  1 to 29). No more than 4 doses of study drug will be 
administered during the DLT Evaluation Period. 
Dose-limiting toxicities are defined as any Grade  3 or greater AE that occurs after the administration of 
study drug during the DLT Evaluation Period that are not related to underlying disease, intercurrent 
illness, or concomitant medications ( Changes in hematology parameters need to have been confirmed 
on repeat assessment  and constitute at least a  2 grade shift . Grade 3 AEs of nausea, vomiting, and 
fatigue that are common and manageable in cancer patients will not be considered DLT if they can be 
ameliorated to  < Grade [ADDRESS_971069] supportive care management.). Adverse events will be graded 
according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) V.4.0. 
Secondary Endpoints:  
• Proportion of patients in each overall response category for each dose cohort based on 
irRC, modified IWG, and/or tumor markers, as appropriate, at each post -treatment tumor 
assessment and at the last assessment  
• Percent change in tumor burden from baseline to each post- treatment tumor assessment 
and the last tumor assessment for each dose cohort  
• The amount of immune response evaluated by: 
o measurement in peripheral blood of WT1 peptide- specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte  
(CTL) induction activity at each assessment time 
o measurement in peripheral blood of WT1 serum antibody titer at each assessment time 
o delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) to the W T2725 peptide at each assessment 
time 
o measurement of level of expression of CD8+, Foxp3, HLA class  I, and WT1 
protein in tumor tissue using immunohistochemistry (IHC) methods 
Exploratory Endpoints:  
• Correlation between the level of expression of WT1 protein and the degree of the immune response at each assessment time as measured by [CONTACT_713500]  
• Evaluation of changes in activity in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) after 
administration of study drug  
Statistical Methods:  
The Safety population will include all enrolled patients who receive at least [ADDRESS_971070] deviation, minimum, 25th percentile, median, 75th percentile, and maximum 
will be provided.  
No imputation will be performed for missing data in this Phase 1 study.

Protocol D8350004 Version 7.[ADDRESS_971081] resulted in the identification of a large number of tumor-
associated antigens (TAAs) and their epi[INVESTIGATOR_713466] (HLA) 
class I-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) from various types of malignant neoplasms 
(Buonaguro-2011). Cytotoxic T cells kill cancer cells by [CONTACT_713503] ( MHC) class  I-peptide complex on the surface of cancer cells. One such TAA 
is the Wilms’ tumor gene product 1 (WT1), which was isolated as a gene responsible for Wilms’ 
tumor, a pediatric renal cancer, and encodes a zinc finger transcription factor, which is involved 
in cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis, and organ development. Expression of the 
wild-type WT1 gene has been found in various types of malignant tumors ( Hutchings-2007 ) such 
as acute myeloid leukemia (AML), acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and myelodysplastic 
syndrome (MDS) at levels higher than those in normal bone marrow or peripheral blood and can 
confer oncogenic functions ( Sugiyama -2005). In addition, various types of solid tumors, 
including breast, lung, thyroid, ovarian, glioblastoma, and colorectal, express the wild-type WT1 
protein at higher levels than surrounding normal tissues ( Nakatsuka- 2006, Oji -2004). 
Injection of peptides in aqueous solutions alone is generally not effective in stimulating CTL 
response. Therefore, adjuvants, such as water- in-oil (W/O) emulsion, have been used to enhance 
the immunog enicity of TAAs by [CONTACT_40397] a depot effect that prevents access of the immunogen 
to tissue and blood-borne proteases, while facilitating TAAs translocation into antigen-presenting cells.  
The WT2725 drug product is referred to as WT2725 Dosing Emulsion and consists of WT2725, 
the acetate salt of a synthetic peptide with the same sequence as the naturally occurring peptide WT1
126-134, diluted in a peptide diluting solution, and administered with a novel adjuvant (W/O 
pre-Emulsion). WT2725 administered intradermally (id) or subcutaneously (sc), is thought to be 
presented on the surface of antigen- presenting cells, eg, dendritic cells, as an MHC class 
I-peptide complex to be recognized by T cells. As a consequence, vaccination with WT2725 
Dosing Emulsion may stimulate the host immune system to induce a CTL response against 
cancer cells that overexpress the WT1 protein, resulting in cell lysis and inhibition of cancer cell proliferation. 
Nonclinical in vitro pharmacology studies confirmed that the WT2725 peptide bound to the 
human antigen-presenting molecule, HLA-A*0201, and induced CD8+ T cells reactive to the WT1
126-134 peptide in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from an 
HLA-A*0201+ healthy donor. Nonclinical in vivo pharmacology studies confirmed that 
WT2725 Injection mixed with the novel W/O pre-Emulsion induced HLA-A*0201- restricted and 
WT2725 peptide- specific CTLs in HLA-A*0201-expressing transgenic mice.  
Additionally, when the WT2725 peptide sequence was analyzed using a web server for the prediction of human MHC class I-peptide binding, the binding affinity to HLA-A*0206 was strong therefore suggesting that WT2725 is expected to bind to not only HLA-A*0201 but also 
Protocol D8350004 Version 7.0  WT2725 Dosing Emulsion 
Confidential and Propri etary 20 3 Dec 2014 HLA-A*0206. HLA-A*0206- restricted and WT1 126-134-reactive CTLs were induced using 
HLA-A*0206 + PBMCs and the induced CTLs showed killing activity to a target cell line 
transfected with HLA -A*0206 and endogenously expressing WT1 protein (International 
Application Published under the Patent Cooperation Treaty: WO2009/072610). It is reported that 
valine and glutamine at position  2 in peptides are anchor residues of HLA-A*0206 ( Sudo-1995) 
and that valine and leucine at position 9 are anchor residues of HLA -A*0206. The WT2725 
peptide has an anchor residue of HLA-A*0206 at position 9. Several HLA -A*[ADDRESS_971082] an anchor residue of HLA-A*0206 at position 9 are reported to be presented 
by [CONTACT_44688]-A*0206 or to elicit a CTL response with restriction of HLA-A*0206 ( Eifuku-2001, 
Fleischhauer -1996, Li-2008, Zhang -2003). 
In repeat-dose toxicity studies of up to 13-weeks duration in cynomolgus monkeys, id or sc 
injection of the planned clinical WT2725 Dosing Emulsion was associated with macroscopic and 
microscopic findings along with clinical observations at the injection site. Additionally, non-
adverse macroscopic and microscopic findings were observed at the injection site following id or 
sc administration of  the Control dosing emulsion. The skin reactions observed following 
administration of WT2725 Dosing Emulsion were the dose- limiting toxicity (DLT) in these 
studies, were noted to be reversible, and are readily monitorable with regular observation of the injection site.  
In a bacterial reverse gene mutation (Ames) assay and an in vitro chromosomal aberration assay, 
WT2725 did not induce mutations or chromosomal aberrations. 
In vitro studies demonstrated that WT2725 was unstable in human and monkey blood, and 
WT2725 was not detected in monkey plasma at any time point after a single id or sc administration.  
In previous clinical stu dies of the WT1
126-134 peptide (administered with various adjuvants and 
combination therapy), few significant adverse reactions were noted, however various local skin reactions were observed  (Kaida-2011, Keilholz-2009, Kuball-2011, Rezvani -2008, 
Gentilini-2006, Soeda-2010).  
Rezvani et al  (2008) reported that WT1
126-134 peptide in combination with PR1 169-177 peptide 
using Montanide ISA-51 VG adjuvant and granulocyte macrophage- colony stimulating factor 
(GM-CSF) resulted in induction of WT1- specific CD8+ T cells . Additionally, Maslak et al  
(2010) using a vaccine of multiple WT1 peptides reported WT1- specific T -cell responses in the 
majority of patients and significant increases in interferon (IFN) -γ-secreting cells and frequency 
of WT1 tetramer+ CD8+  T cells in patients who were HLA-A*0201+. 
This first clinical study of WT2725 Dosing Emulsion is an open-label, dose escalation design to evaluate the safety and tolerability of WT2725 Dosing Emulsion delivered via sc injection in 
order to define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Additionally, antitumor activity and biomarkers indicative of immune response will be evaluated. WT2725 Dosing Emulsion will be administered as monotherapy to patients with one of the followin g advanced malignancies: 
non-small cell lung, ovarian, glioblastoma, and AML (not including acute promyelocytic leukemia), known to overexpress the WT1 protein. Tumors that do not overexpress the WT1 
protein will not be sensitive to WT1 -specific CTLs therefore a subset of malignancies that do 
overexpress the WT1 protein was selected based on a review of the literature ( Franko-2010, 
Nakatsuka-2006, Oji-2003). A rolling-six design ( Skolnik-2008) will be used for enrollment into 
Protocol D8350004 Version 7.[ADDRESS_971083] with determining which doses level(s) to use in future clinical studies. In addition, this study will evaluate both clinical and immunological response. 
4.2. Dose Justification  
4.2.1. Starting Dose Level  
Two repeat -dose toxicology studies of up to 13-weeks duration conducted in cynomolgus 
monkeys using the planned clinical WT2725 Dosing Emulsion administered id (1.0 and 
3.0 mg/body) and sc (3.0 and 9.0 mg/body) once a week were conducted. In both studies, 
WT2725 Dosing Emulsion was associated with macroscopic and microscopic findings along with clinical observations at the injection site. Clinical observations at the injection site consisted 
of swelling, erythema, and/or crust which, in some cases, progressed to ulceration and erosion. 
These skin reactions were the DLT as persistence of ulceration/erosi on for up to 5 days led to 
early euthanasia in some animals and discontinuation of dosing in the high dose groups after the 
tenth or eleventh administration in females and males, respectively. In surviving animals, the 
skin reactions at the injection site were noted to be reversible with discontinuation of dosing and 
administration of topi[INVESTIGATOR_713467]. Systemic toxicological findings were 
limited to intermittent decreases in body weight and alterations in hematology and blood 
chemistry p arameters that were judged to be secondary to stress and inflammatory changes at the 
injection site.  
A clinical study of a HLA -A*02-restricted WT1
126-134 peptide vaccine, in which a peptide with 
the same sequence as the WT2725 peptide was administered with  the Montanide ISA- 51VG 
adjuvant, reported administration of 1.0 and 3.0 mg dose levels without apparent DLT 
(Kaida-2011 ). Vaccine (0.1 mL) was injected id into 6 sites (bilateral arms, 2  sites on the lower 
abdomen, and femoral areas) biweekly on Days 8 an d 22. Gemcitabine was administered 
concurrently on Days 1, 8, and 15. Although the scheduled study period was 2 courses, treatment was continued at the patient’s request if there was no disease progression or serious adverse 
events (SAEs). Grade 1 or 2 ski n reaction at the site of vaccination, characterized by [CONTACT_12070], 
Protocol D8350004 Version 7.0  WT2725 Dosing Emulsion 
Confidential and Propri etary 22 3 Dec 2014 pruritus, and induration, was observed in all patients (n = 25). WT1- specific T cells in peptide-
stimulated culture were detected by [CONTACT_713504] 46% (5  of 11) of patients. 
The results o f this clinical trial provide information about the safety of the WT1 126-134 peptide 
vaccine based on pharmacological action of WT1 126-134 peptide specific CTL. Although the 
adjuvant used in the clinical trial was different from that of the WT2725 Dosing E mulsion in its 
composition, the potential to induce WT1 126-134 peptide specific CTL with the Montanide 
ISA-51VG adjuvant and the novel W/O pre -Emulsion  for WT2725 Dosing Emulsion was 
evaluated and found to be similar in HLA -A02 transgenic mice. Furthermore, the W/O 
pre-Emulsion to be used with WT2725 by [CONTACT_713505] 13-week cynomolgus monkey studies . In addition, t he same W/O pre -Emulsion  has 
already been administered to several patient s in 2 ongoing clinical trials of another modified 
peptide from the HLA -A*2402- restricted WT1 235-243 peptide in Japan. In the Phase 1 solid tumor 
trial, as of 31 Dec  2011, for 3 enrolled patients only Grade  1 adverse events (AEs) had been 
reported including injection site reactions and for 1 additional patient Grade  2 injection site 
reaction and hypertension had been reported; this is preliminary draft data from an active, 
unlocked database and subject to change (data on file Chugai Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd). In the 
Phase 1/2 MDS study, as of the same date, for the one enrolled patient no injection site reactions 
had been observed, although Grade 4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, Grade 3 febrile neutropenia and leucopenia, and Grade 2 urticaria had been reported in addition to other Grade 1 AEs; this is preliminary draft data from an active, unlocked database and subject to change (data 
on file Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma Co., Ltd). Because low blood cell counts are common with 
MDS and there have been few other toxiciti es greater than Grade 1 in these trials, the novel W/O 
pre-Emulsion  used with WT2725 is not expected to cause unexpected  severe AEs. 
In terms of clinical efficacy, it has been reported  that sc injection s of 0.2 mg WT1
126-134 peptide 
in combination with 0.5 mg PR1169-177 peptide using Montanide ISA-51VG adjuvant and 
GM-CSF resulted in induction of WT1- specific CD8+ T cells ( Rezvani-2008). The dose of 
0.2 mg per peptide also has been reported to be within the range found to be safe and active for 
other peptide vaccines ( Maslak-2010). These reports  suggest that this dose level may have a 
likelihood of immunologic al activity. 
For this study, a clinical starting dose of 0.3 mg/body  (2 injection sites ) is planned for Part  1, 
based on the following considerations: 
1. 0.3 mg/body by [CONTACT_713506] 1/10th the lower dose (3.0 mg/body 
WT2725 Dosing Emulsion) in the sc  cynomolgus monkey study at which a severe skin 
lesion (ulceration ) was noted in one animal . Of note, similar lesions observed at the 
highest dose (9.0 mg/body) showed reversibility with discontinuation of dosing and 
antibiotic treatment. In addition, skin lesions observed in the 1.0 mg/body id cohort 
showed reversibility without discontinuation of dosing or antibiotic treatment. 
2. Similar skin lesions have been observed in clinical studies of WT1 126-134 peptide (doses 
ranging from 0.2 mg – 3 mg) (Kaida-2011, Keilholz -2009, Kuball-2011, Rezvani -2008, 
Gentilini-2006, Soeda-2010). Treatment for these skin lesions has included dermal steroid treatment and  topi[INVESTIGATOR_713468]- inflammatory drugs . 
3. There were no DLTs reported from the published clinical studies of the naturally occurring WT
1126-134 peptide. A dose of 0.3 mg/body is approximately 1/10th the dose of 
Protocol D8350004 Version 7.[ADDRESS_971084] a starting dose at which some clinical benefit for 
cancer patients may be ex pected, based on the results of clinical studies of other WT1 
peptides 0.3 mg/body is anticipated to be within an immunologically active dose range.  
4.2.2. Additional Dose Levels for Part [ADDRESS_971085] pla nned dose of 9.0 mg 
being administered without dose- limiting toxicity. This dose was considered the recommended 
phase 2 dose (RP2D), and additional patients  were enrolled and initiate d treatment at this dose. 
As of May [ADDRESS_971086] common drug- related adverse reactions  reported with doses up to 
9.0 mg were low grade localized injection site reactions with itching, erythema, pain, bruising , 
and/or swelling. A total of 14 treatment emergent serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported in 
9 patients; there was  no pattern in the types of treatment emergent SAEs reported. Two serious 
adverse reactions (SARs; defined as SAEs that were assessed as at least possibly related to study 
drug) were reported in 2 patients; tumor necrosis was reported in [ADDRESS_971087] been observed, the 9.0 mg dose is not considered the MTD. Preliminary review of efficacy data indicates that 
WT2725 Dosing Emulsion has the potential to be of benefit to patients, which may be further 
enhanced by [CONTACT_713507]. Based on the results from these initial patients  in Part 1, additional dose escalation, at no more than double the prior dose 
level, is being explored to evaluate safety, tolerability, and efficacy. In addition, extension of the induction and consolidation phases of treatment will be explored. 
4.2.3. Route of Administration  
Langerhans cells, which function as antigen -presenting cells, are widely distributed within the 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_49196], and there are multiple reports of id and sc dosing of cancer vaccines to sequester 
antigen in the intradermal or subcutaneous tissue near the epi[INVESTIGATOR_713469]. A previous clinical study using WT1
235-243, 2M→Y peptide  (Oka-2008, Oka -2004) 
demonstrated that there was induction of WT1-specific CTL as a result of id dosing. A study by [CONTACT_539876] ( 2009) of WT1
126-134 peptide in keyhole- limpet-hemocyanin adjuvant plus 
GM-CSF demonstrated induction of WT1-specific CTL following id and sc injection and 
Rezvani et al  (2008) using deep sc injection of WT1 126-134 peptide in combination with PR1 169-177 
peptide using a different adjuvant observed induction of WT1- specific CD8+ T cells following 
sc injection of the [ADDRESS_971088] ions other than local injection site skin reactions therefore presenting an 
acceptable benefit/risk profile to study participants.  
In this study at doses up to the RP2D of 9.[ADDRESS_971089] common drug- related 
adverse reactions reported were low grade localized injection site reactions with itching, 
erythema, pain, bruising, and/or swelling. A total of 14 treatment -emergent SAEs were reported 
in 9 patients; there was no pattern in the types of treatment emergent SAEs reported. Two  SARs 
were reported in 2 patients; tumor necrosis was reported in [ADDRESS_971090] been observed, the 9.0 mg dose is not considered the 
MTD. Preliminary review of efficacy data indicates that WT2725 Dosing Emulsion has the potential to be of benefit to patients, which may be further enhanced by [CONTACT_713508]. Based on th e results from these initial patients  in Part 1, 
additional dose escalation, at no more than double the prior dose level, is being explored to 
evaluate safety, tolerability, and efficacy. In addition, extension of the induction and 
consolidation phases of treatment will be explored.

Confidential and Propri etary 26 3 Dec 2014 6. STUDY ENDPOINTS  
6.1. Primary Endpoints  
The safety and tolerability of WT2725 Dosing Emulsion will be evaluated based on the 
occurrence of DLT and AEs, and the findings from clinical laboratory tests, vital signs measurements, body weight measurements, and electrocardiogram (ECG) results.  
The determination of the MTD of WT2725 Dosing Emulsion will be based on the incidence of DLT at each dose level and the overall safety profile of WT2725 Dosing Emulsion. The incidence of DLT will be evaluated during the DLT Evaluation Period, which extends from the 
day of the first dose to just prior to the fifth dose of study drug (Days 1 to 29). No more than 
4 doses of study drug will be administered during the DLT Evaluation Period. 
Dose-limiting toxicities are defined as any Grade  3 or greater AE that occurs after the 
administration of study drug duri ng the DLT Evaluation Period that are not related to underlying 
disease, intercurrent illness, or concomitant medications ( Changes in hematology parameters 
need to have been confirmed on repeat assessment  and constitute at least a 2  grade shift . Grade 3 
AEs of nausea, vomiting, and fatigue that are common and manageable in cancer patients will 
not be considered DLT if they can be ameliorated to  < Grade [ADDRESS_971091] supportive care 
management. ). Adverse events will be graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria 
for Adverse Events (CTCAE) V.4.0 ( NCI-2009). 
6.2. Secondary Endpoints   
• Proportion of patients in each overall response category for each dose cohort based on 
irRC, modified IWG, and/or tumor markers, as appropriate, at each post- treatment 
tumor assessment and at the last assessment  
• Percent change in tumor burden from baseline to each post- treatment tumor 
assessment and the last tumor assessment for each dose cohort 
• The amount of immune response evaluated by: 
o measurement in peripheral blood of WT1 peptide-specific CTL induction activity at each assessment time  
o measurement in peripheral blood of WT1 serum antibod y titer at each 
assessment time  
o DTH to the WT2725 peptide at each assessment time

• Correlation between the level of expression of WT1 protein and the degree of the 
immune response at each assessment time as measured by [CONTACT_713500]  
• Evaluation of changes in activity in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) after administration of study drug  
Protocol D8350004 Version 7.[ADDRESS_971092] progressive or recurrent 
measurable (may be measurable by [CONTACT_713499], such as quantitative reverse 
transcriptase – polymerase chain reaction [RT -PCR] for WT1 transcript for AML, or cancer 
antigen 125 [CA-125] for ovarian carcinoma) neoplastic disease despi[INVESTIGATOR_713470]. In Part 1 of the study patients with 
one of the following malignancies: non-small cell lung, ovarian, glioblast oma, and acute myeloid 
leukemia ( AML; not including acute promyelocytic leukemia ) meeting the above criteria are 
eligible. In Part 2 of the study patients with glioblastoma  and AML (not including acute 
promyelocytic leukemia ) meeting the above criteria are eligible. 
Both parts of the study will primarily evaluate DLT and define the MTD of WT2725 Dosing 
Emulsion during the DLT Evaluation Period, which extends from the day of the first dose of 
study drug to just prior to the fifth dose (Days 1 - 29). Dose -limiting toxicities are defined as any 
Grade 3 or greater AE that occur s after the administration of study drug during the DLT 
Evaluation Period that are not related to underlying disease, intercurrent illness, or concomitant medications  (Changes in hematology parameters need to have been confirmed on repeat 
assessment  and constitute at least a 2  grade shift. Grade 3 AEs of nausea, vomiting, and fatigue 
that are common and manageable in cancer patients will not be considered DLT if they can be ameliorated to < Grade [ADDRESS_971093] supportive care management.). In addition, antitumor 
activity and biomarkers indicative of immune response will be evaluated from the first dose until 
discontinuation of the patient from the study. An end of study assessment will take place within 
[ADDRESS_971094] 2  patients, then a “rolling- six” design will be employed that 
allows accrual of 2  to 6 patients concurrently in each dose escalation cohort. This design was 
chosen in an effort to reduce the delays associated with patient accrual using the classical “3 + 3” 
design as severe immediate reactions are not anticipated following administration of WT2725 
Dosing Emulsion. The decision to enroll an additional patient in the current dose cohort, to dose 
escalate to the next dose cohort, or to dose de- escalate to  a lower dose cohort can be made 
without having to suspend enrollment following the initial enrollment of 3 patients, as in the 
“3 + 3” design. The decision regarding dose cohort for an incoming patient is dependent on the 
number of DLTs that have been observed, the number of patients enrolled at any time and the 
duration of their enrollment, and in Part 2 of the study the malignancy type . The goal remains to 
define the MTD as the dose level where no more than 1 of 6 patients experiences a DLT when 2 of 2 to 6 patients experiences a DLT at the next higher dose level. Meetings to review study execution and enrollment/dosing decisions will be held at least monthly between the sponsor, 
clinical sites, and the medical monitor. The expected time to enroll each dose escalation cohort 
(2 – 6 patients) is between 6 and 12 weeks.  
The following dose cohorts of WT2725 Dosing Emulsion are planned for Part 1 of the study: 
Protocol D8350004 Version 7.0  WT2725 Dosing Emulsion 
Confidential and Propri etary 29 3 Dec 2014 • 0.3, 0.9, 3.0, and 9.0 mg  
An approximate 3-fold increase in dose between cohorts (eg, 0.3, 0.9, 3.0 mg) will allow this  
dose range to be explored with the fewest number of dose levels. 
The following dose cohorts of WT2725 Dosing Emulsion are planned for Part 2 of the study: 
• 18.0 and 27.0 mg  
No more than a 2-fold increase in dose between cohorts (eg, 9.0, 18.0, 27.0 mg) will allow this 
higher dose range to be explored more conservatively . 
In Part [ADDRESS_971095] tolerable dose cohort (MTD or highest planned cohort) will continue 
until there are at least 6  patients total in the study with each tumor type that are evaluable for 
DLT, biomarkers, and response. This dose is considered the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). 
Enrollment of up to [ADDRESS_971096] been established for the 18.0 mg  cohort, enrollment of subsequent patients will be 
conducted sequentially in the 27.0 mg  cohort. Approximately 10 patient s at each dose level (18.0 
and 27.0 mg) with at least 4  patients with each malignancy type (glioblastoma and AML) will be 
enrolled at each of these dose levels.  If the MTD is reached in Part  2 before the total of 
20 patients are enrolled, remaining patients will be enrolled at the prior dose level.  Patients who 
experience DLT may  remain on the study at a reduced dose if they are deriving some therapeutic 
benefit from study drug and fulfill the criteria for study continuation for subsequent dosing (see 
Section 8.3.2); these decisions will be addressed on a case by [CONTACT_413]. Patients who experience 
a DLT or other significant toxicity at this reduced dose will be discontinued from receiving further study drug. In the event that a dose level is excluded from further study due to dose limiting toxicity all patients may continue the study at the most recently completed dose without 
DLT, eg, if the 27.[ADDRESS_971097] not 
experienced a D LT, ≥ Grade [ADDRESS_971098] been established. Patient s may remain on study drug until evidence of 
confirmed progressive disease, intolerance to study drug, or fulfillment of any of the other criteria for discontinuation (see Section 12.2). 
Each part of t he study will include 3  treatment phases based on intended timing of study drug 
dosing as indicated below: 
Part 1: 
• Vaccine Induction Phase: once every 7  days for 4  weeks (doses  1 - 5) 
• Consolidation Phase: once every 14 days for 6  weeks (doses 6 - 9) 
• Maintenance Phase: once every 28  days until discontinuation (dose 10 and thereafter) 
Part 2: 
• Vaccine Induction Phase: once every 7  days for 8 weeks (doses 1 - 9) 
• Consolidation Phase: once every 14 days for 1 0 weeks (doses 10 – 15 [maximum 
6 doses]) 
• Maintenance Phase: once every 28  days until discontinuation (dose 16 and thereafter) 
Approximately 60 to 80 patients total including replacements will be dosed in this clinical trial. 
The total number of patients dosed in this clinical trial will be deter mined by [CONTACT_713510], as well as the number of RP2D cohorts enrolled. If all 4  dose escalation cohorts are 
necessary  in Part 1, and if 6 enrolled patients are required in each dose escalation cohort and/or 
tumor type, then 24 patients evaluable for DLT, biomarkers, and response would be necessary in the Part 1 dose escalation . In addition, up to 30 patients may be enrolled in the RP2D cohorts in 
Part 1. If both dose escalation cohorts are necessary in Part  2, and if 10 patients are enrolled in 
each of these cohorts, then 20 patients will be enrolled in Part 2. Patients who discontinue from the study prior to completion of the DLT, biomarker response evaluatio n period will be replaced 
likely increasing the total number of patients enrolled .  
Four to 8 investigative sites in the [LOCATION_002] (US) will be utilized to enroll patients  in Part 1 
of the study. An additional 2 sites in the US  may be opened to enroll patient s in Part 2.

up to [ADDRESS_971145] 2  patients; after which, if initial acceptable safety has been 
observed, there is no requirement to w ait between enrolling indiv idual patients within a cohort. 
After completion of DLT evaluation for the first dose cohort, if the study continues, enrollment 
of subsequent patients will be conducted sequentially in subsequent dose escalation cohorts and 
continue until the MTD or all planned cohorts are attained in the dose escalation part s of the 
study. 
The 0.[ADDRESS_971146] 3 patients in the 0.3 mg dose cohort, up to 
3 more patients may be enrolled in that cohort. 
Again, in subsequent dose escalation cohorts in Part  1, if 3 patients in a dose cohort complete the 
DLT Evaluation Period and there are no DLTs identified, then the dose level is increased, otherwise enrollment of additional patients (up to 3 more) may be permitted in the same cohort. 
If one of [ADDRESS_971147]. I f 3 patients in the dose cohort 
complete the DLT Evaluation Period and there are no DLTs identified, then the 27.0 mg dose

18.0 mg cohort, enrollment of subsequent patients will be conducted sequentially in the 27.0 mg  
cohort. If additional patients are ready to enroll in the study prior to completion of the DLT 
Evaluation Period for the 27.0 mg dose cohort, up to a total of 10 patients may be enrolled at the 
18.0 mg dose level. Approximately 10 patien ts at each dose level (18.0 and 27.0 mg) with at 
least 4 patients with each malignancy type (glioblastoma and AML ) will be enrolled. If the MTD 
is reached in Part  2 before the total of 20 patients are enrolled, remaining patients will be 
enrolled at the prior dose level. Patients not evalu able for DLT assessment may be replaced.  
If at any time during dose escalation  2 or more patients experience DLT within a dose cohort that 
suggests that the MTD has been exceeded; no additional patients will be enrolled into that dose cohort and dose escalation will end. The MTD will be the dose level below that which resulted in

All drug products must be prepared and stored under ambient conditions on the day of dosing, 
and used or discarded within [ADDRESS_971188] been establish ed for the 0.3 mg dose 
cohort (following completion of DLT Evaluation Period), enrollment of subsequent patients will 
be conducted sequentially in subsequent dose escalation cohorts and continue until the MTD or 
all planned cohorts are attained. This dose is considered the RP2D, and subsequent patients 
enrolled will initiate treatment at this dose.  Additional dose escalation cohorts aft er the initial 
expansion cohort s may be enrolled if a MTD has not been determined and significant signs of 
toxicity have not been observed in the expansion cohorts. In Part [ADDRESS_971189] been established for the 18.0 mg 
cohort, enrollment of subsequent patients will be conducted sequentially in the 27.0 mg  cohort. If 
additional patients are ready to enroll in the study prior to completion of the DLT Evaluation Period for the 27.0 mg dose cohort, up to a total of 10 patients may be enr olled at the 18.0 mg 
dose level . 
Each dose of study drug will be administered using 2 injection sites ( eg, 0.3 mL/site  x 2 for the 
9.0 mg dose). The only restriction on the dosing site is that the forearm used for the DTH skin 
tests should not be used for administration of study drug. Wherever possible, injections should be administered into the area surrounding the regional lymph nodes in the upper arm, the lower 
abdomen, or the femoral area. Rotation of injection sites is permitted. Injection sites should not 
be chosen in the area of any ongoing skin condition, eg, a rea of psoriasis.  
Each part of the study will include 3 treatment phases based on intended timing of study drug 
dosing as indicated below: 
Part 1: 
• Vaccine Induction Phase: once every 7  days for 4  weeks (doses  1 - 5) 
• Consolidation Phase: once every 14 days for 6 weeks (doses 6 - 9)

Confidential and Proprietary 63 3 Dec 2014 11. TREATMENT PLAN  
11.1. Study Assessments  
11.1.1. Safety 
Safety assessments will be conducted at each study visit as indicated on the Schedules of 
Assessments ( Tables 3 - 6) and will include the spontaneous reporting of AEs, physical 
examinations, determinations of vital signs, body weight measurements, ECGs, and clinical 
laboratory determinations including complete blood count, serum chemistries, and urinalysis. 
Careful monitoring for signs of local injection site reactions will be performed during the study. 
In addition, these assessments will be used to describe the DLT and determine the MTD. The 
definition of DLT is provided in Section  7.2.1 and the determination of MTD is discussed in 
Section 7.3. 
11.1.2. Efficacy 
Tumor response will be evaluated according to the irRC ( Wolchok-2009, Hoos-2010), modified 
IWG based on Cheson-2003, and/or tumor markers, as appropriate for the diagnosis. An 
evaluable patient for response is defined as a patient who has had at least one tumor assessmen t 
conducted [ADDRESS_971193] dose of study drug or a patient who has progressive disease prior to this time point.  
Survival also will be assessed. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Immune-related Response Criteria (irRC)  
The irRC was chosen because immunotherapeutic agents produce a ntitumor effects by [CONTACT_713515], which is unique from cytotoxic agents.  
The use of radiographic procedures, physical examinations, and measurement of tumor markers for evaluation of response will be performed based on the presence of known areas of disease and current symptoms. Unless there are compelling reasons othe rwise, the tumor assessments 
during the study will be conducted under the same conditions (eg, slice thickness, use of a contrast agent, etc) and using the same examination method (eg, CT, MRI) as used for the pretreatment assessment.  
Tumor assessments will be conducted during screening, and then every [ADDRESS_971194] be completed before study drug is administered.  
Tumor response is based on total measurable tumor burden. For the irRC, index and measurable 
new lesions are taken into account. A measurable lesion is defined as 5 × [ADDRESS_971195] perpendicular 
diameters (SPD) of all index lesions (5  lesions per organ, up to 10 visceral lesions, and 
5 cutaneous index lesions) is calculated.  
At each subsequent tumor assessment, the SPD of the index lesions and of new, measurable lesions (≥ 5 × 5 mm; up to 5  new lesions per organ; 5 new cutaneous lesions; and 10 visceral 
lesions) are added together to provide the total tumor burden: 
Tumor Burden = SPD
index lesions  + SPD new, measurable lesions  
Percentage changes in tumor burden per assessment time point describe the size and growth of 
both baseline and new, measurable lesions as they appear. At each tumor assessment, the 
response in index and new, measurable lesions is defined based on the change in tumor burden (after ruling out immune -related progressive disease [irPD]). Decreases in tumor burden must be 
assessed relative to  pretreatment measurements (ie, the SPD of all index lesions at screening).  
Overall response will be determined by [CONTACT_713516]: 
• irCR (immune -related complete response)  = complete disappearance of all lesions 
(whether measurable or not, and no new lesions) confirmation by a repeat, 
consecutive assessment [ADDRESS_971196] documentation  
•  irPR (immune -related partial response)  = decrease in tumor burden ≥ 50% relative to 
baseline confirmed by a consecutive assessment [ADDRESS_971197] 
documentation 
• irSD (immune -related stable disease)  = not meeting criteria for irCR or irPR and the 
absence of irPD  
• irPD (immune -related progressive disease)  = increase in tumor burden ≥ 25% relative 
to nadir (prior minimum recorded tumor burden during the study) confirmation by a 
repeat, consecutive assessment at least [ADDRESS_971198] documentation  
Note: For patients  with glioblastoma, measurements should include enhancing tumor only, 
nonenhancing lesions (T2/FLAIR) should be recorded as improved, stable, or significant increase. 
Note: For patients with glioblastoma, progressive disease should additionally be confirme d by 
[CONTACT_25505]-photon emission computed tomography ( SPECT), perfusion MRI, MRI spectroscopy or 
C-14 methionine positron-emission tomography ( PET) or pathology from available 
surgical/biopsy specimens  to differentiate from pseudoprogression. For patients with ovarian 
cancer that express CA -125, progressive disease should additionally be confirmed by [CONTACT_28474]-125 
(≥ 2x higher of ULN or on study nadir). 
Note: For irPD confirmation, follow-up with observation alone (during the weeks before 
confirmation) may not be appropriate for patients with a rapid decline in ECOG performance 
status or other signs of rapid clinical deterioration. The investigator should use his best judgment in determining if sooner tumor assessment is required in these patients. 
Note: Patients with progressive disease based on tumor assessments who are experiencing 
clinical benefit in the investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_713481] D8350004 Version 7.0  WT2725 Dosing Emulsion 
Confidential and Proprietary 65 3 Dec 2014 assessments. If subsequent stabilization or improvement is observed the patient may continue in 
the study. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Modified International Working Group response criteria in acute myeloid 
leukemia (IWG)  
The modified International Working Group (IWG) response criteria were developed to assess the 
activity of drugs in AM L. The criteria are as follows:  
• Complete remission (CR): 
• Morphologic CR 
< 5% Marrow blasts in an aspi[INVESTIGATOR_241771] – patient independent of 
transfusions 
 Absolute neutrophil count > 1000/μL 
 Platelets >  100,000/μL 
 No residual evidence of extramedullary disease  
• Cytogenetic CR - cytogenetics normal (in patients with previously abnormal 
cytogenetics)  
• Molecular CR - molecular studies negative  
• CRi - < 5% marrow blasts but with persistence of cytopenias (ie , absolute neutrophil 
count < 1000 /μ L and/or platele ts < 100,000/μ L) 
• Morphologic leukemia free state (MLFS) - bone marrow blasts < 5%  
• Partial remission: 
Decrease of at least 50% in the percentage of blasts to 5%  to 25% in the bone 
marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_713482], as noted above. 
• PRi:  
Decrease of at least 50% in the percentage of blasts to 5%  to 25% in the bone 
marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_713483] (ie, absolute neutrophil count 
< 1000/μL and/or platelets < 100,000/μL ). 
Measurable disease will be defined as > 5% marrow blas ts. 
Relapse following complete remission is defined as reappearance of leukemic blasts in the 
peripheral blood or the finding of more than 5% blasts in the bone marrow, not attributable to 
another cause, or extramedullary relapse.  
Progressive disease will be defined as  increase of at least 50% in the percentage of blasts in the 
bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_713484] 10  percent of blasts in the bone marrow 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337]. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Tumor Markers  
Tumor markers may be utilized to assess response as appropriate for the diagnosis. This  should 
include at least  quantitative RT-PCR for WT1 transcript in blood or bone marrow for patients 
Protocol D8350004 Version 7.[ADDRESS_971199] dose but may be 
performed more frequently. 
11.1.3. Other 
Biomarker analyses will be conducted as indicated on the Schedules of Assessments 
(Tables 3 - 6). An evaluable patient for biomarkers is defined as a patient who has had the 
Day 29 biomarker assessments completed. Directions for the handling and processing of 
biomarker samples are provided in a separate manual.  
Peripheral blood samples will be obtained for evaluation of WT1 peptide-specific CTL induction activity by [CONTACT_438563], and W T1 serum antibody titer by [CONTACT_28745] -linked immunosorbent 
assay [ELISA], and for isolation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) for exploratory biomarker analyses. In addition, blood samples will be obtained and blood serum archived for possible analyses of other biomarkers, such as protein and microRNA, that may be important to 
the understanding of WT2725 but which have not yet been selected. Providing informed consent 
for use of this sample for pharmacogenetic purposes is optional, and participation in the study is not dependent upon providing this sample. 
Delayed-type hypersensitivity to the WT2725 peptide will be measured approximately 48 hours 
(but no sooner than 24 hours) after id inoculation with WT2725 in diluted WT2725 Injection for 
DTH skin t ests. The site of diluted WT2725 Injection inoculation will be compared to the site of 
inoculation with the negative control (DSWI). The criteria for evaluation include injection site erythema diameter and quality (eg, redness, induration, ulceration, etc ). Directions for 
conducting and evaluating DTH skin tests are provided in Appendix VII. 
Immunohistochemistry in tumor tissue will be evaluated by [CONTACT_389]8+, Foxp3, HLA 
class I, and WT1 protein using tumor tissue samples obtained before the first dose and after the 
last dose of study drug. In place of tumor tissue samples from biopsy during screening, archived 
tumor tissue samples may be provided. Biopsy for tumor tissue samples after the last dose of 
study drug is not mandatory and refusal to consent to post- treatment biopsy samples will not 
exclude a patient from enrollment in the study. IHC need not be performed for patients with 
AML provided RT- PCR for WT1 transcript is assessed.

DISCONTINUATION 
12.1. Clinical Assessments After Study Medication Discontinuation  
Every effort should be made for all treated patients discontinuing study drug, regardless of cause, 
and, prior to the start of alternate treatment to undergo final evaluation procedures, in accordance 
with the End of Study visit as described in Section  [IP_ADDRESS]. 
12.2. Study Participation Termination Criteria  
The possible reasons for study drug discontinuation and study participation termination are to be 
assessed for each enrolled patient and are as f ollows: 
• Adverse event.  
• Progressive disease.  
• Death: 
o Death due to progressive disease.  
o Death due to other causes 
• Study stopped by [CONTACT_3211]. 
• Lost to follow-up. 
• Protocol violation (specify). 
• Pregnancy.  
• Withdrawal by [CONTACT_4676] (specify).  
• Other (specify).  
12.3. Replacement of Patients  
Patients who discontinue from the study for a reason other than DLT prior to completing the 
DLT Eval uation Period will be replaced. 
Protocol D8350004 Version 7.[ADDRESS_971228] be 
recorded on the CRF and the data recorded should match that on the SAE form. 
Non-leading questions will be used to ask patients about the possible occurrence of AEs. The 
Investigator should attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, symptoms, and/or other clinical information. In such cases, the diagnosis should be documented as the AE and not the individual signs/symptoms. 
Following questioning and evaluation, all AEs, whether believed by [CONTACT_713517], must be documented in the patient’s study records/source documents, in accordance with the Investigator’s normal clinical practice, and on the AE page of 
the CRF. Each AE is to be evaluated for duration, severity according to the CTCAE V.4.0, 
seriousness, and causal relationship to the study medication. Appendix VIII (Definitions for 
Reporting Adverse Events) provides definitions for relationship to study medication, and action 
taken, and reference to CTCAE for grade. An AE is deemed associated wit h the use of the study 
drug “if there is a reasonable possibility that the experience may have been caused by  [CONTACT_33641]” 
(21 CFR 312.32 [a]). 
The Medical Monitor is the initial contact [CONTACT_29970]. The contact [CONTACT_713518] [ADDRESS_971229] be recorded as AEs. Clinically signif icant abnormal objective findings (eg, clinical laboratory value, ECG 
value, and physical examination observation) will also be recorded on the Adverse Event page of 
the CRF from signing of the informed consent onwards. When a clear diagnosis is available that 
explains the objective findings, this diagnosis will be recorded as the AE, and not the abnormal objective finding (eg, viral hepatitis will be recorded as the AE, not transaminase elevation). If a 
definite diagnosis is not available, then the sign (e g, clinically significant elevation of 
transaminase levels) or symptom (eg, abdominal pain) will be recorded as the AE. 
Progression of the malignancy being treated in the study is not reported as an AE. 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_713491]. Clinical symptoms of progression may be reported as AEs if the symptoms cannot be

An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” if, in the view of either the 
Investigator or Sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: death, a life-t hreatening AE, 
in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] (Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_713492].), a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, or a 
congenital anomaly/birth defect. Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -
threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate 
medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at 
home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the 
development of drug dependency or drug abuse.

All AEs will be coded using MedDRA, version 14.0 or higher. 
The occurrence of DLT events during the DLT evaluation period w ill be summarized for each 
dose cohort. 
Treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) will be defined as: 
• AEs that occurred on or after the first dose of study drug and on or before the 30th day 
after the last do se of study drug, 
• AEs with a missing start date and a stop date on or after the first dose of study drug, 
or 
• AEs with both a missing start and stop date.  
TEAEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_713525].  
The following AEs will be summarized and presented by [CONTACT_713526]: 
• All TEAEs (including number of events and patient incidence) 
• TEAEs by [CONTACT_72843] (unrelated, or related)  
• TEAEs by [CONTACT_713527] d before the start of the event. 
The following conventions will be followed in summarizing AEs: 
• For patient incidence summaries, each patient will be counted only once within each 
SOC and within each PT. 
• If a patient reports more than one AE within a PT and/or a SOC, the AE with the 
highest known grade within each SOC and within each PT will be included in the 
summaries by [CONTACT_479].  
• For summaries by [CONTACT_92254], AEs whose relationship to treatment is assessed as “not related” will be grouped as “unrelated.” AEs assessed as 
“possible,” “probable,” or “definite,” unknown or missing will be grouped as 
“related.” If a patient reports more than one AE within the same treatment regimen, 
SOC and PT, and any are related, it  will be summarized as re lated. 
A listing of all TEAEs, SAEs, and AEs leading to discontinuation or death, will be presented. A 
separate listing for non- treatment -emergent AEs will also be provided. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Clinical Laboratory Assessments

1. Requirements for Testing  
ECG equipment and supplies will be provided by [CONTACT_29999]-
clinic protocol ECG ass essments.  
• All 12-lead ECGs will be recorded in the same manner.  
• The site personnel must be adequately trained in performing ECGs on the specific ECG equipment used in this protocol that is provide d by [CONTACT_708566].  
• To the extent possible, the same ECG machine and personnel should be used to acquire a patient’s ECGs throughout the period of their participation in the study.  
• Indelible ink will be used to mark the placement of the leads on the skin to ensure consistent placement throughout the study.  
• ECGs will be recorded with at least one 10 -second single-lead tracing recorded from 
Lead II. 
2. Patient Restrictions and Instructions  
• Prior to ECG acquisition, the patient will have rested 10 minutes in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_29930]. 
3. Reporting  
• It is the responsibility of the Investigator to perform a safety review of the ECG data for changes from previous assessments and/or emergent cardiac dysfunction, and to 
determine patients’ eligibility or continuance in the study. 
• ECGs will be reviewed (signed and dated as necessary when an electronic system is 
not used) by [CONTACT_713534] 1572 (MD or DO) after each 
ECG collection. The same Investigator should review all ECG reports for a given patient whenever possible. 
• For all ECGs, a report will be provided by [CONTACT_713535].  
• The ECG tracing will be kept with patient’s source documentation and / or CRF unless it is specified otherwise. The original ECG and the cardiologist’ s over-read 
will be retained at the site.  
4. Data Standardization 
ECG data will be transmitted to a centralized cardiac safety vendor and centrally over -read and 
interpreted using standardized procedures.

• Not related  – improbable temporal relationship and is plausibly related to other drugs or 
underlying disease. 
• Possible - occurred in a reasonable time after study drug administration, but could be 
related to concurrent drugs or underlying disease.  
• Probable  - occurred in a reasonable time after study drug administration, is unlikely to 
be attributable to concurrent drugs or underlying disease, and there is a plausible mechanism to implicate the study drug.  
• Definite - occurred in a reasonable time after study drug administration and cannot be 
explained by [CONTACT_29969]. The adverse event should respond 
to dechallenge/rechallenge, however, this is not mandatory before assigning a definite causality.  
The action taken regarding study drug will be defined as follows: 
• Dose Not Changed  – no change.  
• Dose Reduced.  
• Dose Increased.  
• Drug Interrupted  – study drug stopped temporarily. 
• Drug Withdrawn  – study drug stopped permanently. 
• Not Applicable.

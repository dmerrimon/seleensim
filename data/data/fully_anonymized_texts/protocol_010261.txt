  
Effects of Unloader Bracing in Clinical Outcome and Articular Cartilage 
Physiology Following Microfracture of Isolated Chondral Defects  
Study Protocol  
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
December 13, [ADDRESS_1179220] challenging 
clinical problems for orthopaedic surgeons. Articular cartilage is a highly organized tissue 
with complex biomechanical properties and substantial durability. However, it has a poor 
intrinsic capacity for healing, and defects resulting from trauma can result in con siderable 
functional impairment  and lead to subsequent joint degeneration and osteoarthritis . 1  
Bone marrow stimulation through ‘ microfracture’ is the most frequently used technique for 
treating small symptomatic defects of the articular cartilage in the knee. I t is a technically  
straightforward procedure, and the costs are low compared with those of other treatment 
modalities. Microfracture involves perforation of the subchondral plate in order to recruit 
mesenchymal stem cells from the bone marrow space into th e lesion2. The formation of a 
stable blood clot that  maximally fills the chondral defect is important, and it has been 
correlated with the success of bone marrow stimulation procedures1. 
Two aspects of post-operative rehabilitation are thought to be critical to the success of 
microfracture. First, pro tected weight -bearing for [ADDRESS_1179221] -operative  unloading brace 
will improve outcomes of  the microfracture procedure for treatment of isolated cartilage 
lesions . 
  
Study Design  (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_16116])  
Recruitment  
A pi[INVESTIGATOR_848187]. [ADDRESS_1179222] less than 2cm2 in size located 
on the medial  or lateral  femoral condyle, age between 1 8-40 years, and overall neutral lower 
limb mechanical alignment  (<5 degrees varus or valgus) .  Exclusion criteria include previous 
chondral procedures, osteoarthri tis (Kellegren -Lawrence Grade ≥ 2), or significant 
concomitant knee pathology such as a meniscal tear requir ing treatment or a ligamentous 
instability .  Patients who have previously undergone  ACL reconstruction or meniscal repair 
will still be eligible for inclusion in the study.   
Initia l post-operative protocol  
All patients will participate in physical therapy two times per week , use a continuous passive 
motion  device for eight weeks and will have no ROM restrictions. Following enrollment, 10 
patients will be randomized into one of two g roups  at each center . Group 1 will be fitted with 
the Ossur Unloader One brace. Group 2 w ill be treated without a brace. At Center 1 ([LOCATION_003]), 
patients will be initially kept non -weight bearing for a period of 8 weeks prior to applying an 
unloader brace. At C entre 2 (Japan), patients will wear an off -loading brace  and commence 
weight bearing immediately post -operatively. Non-bracing group will be NWB for [ADDRESS_1179223] is filled.

concentration. Higher concentrations of GAG generally indicate healthier cartilage. 
Moreover, correlations have been found between T2 values and cartilage hydration, collagen 
fiber orientation, and loss of type 2 collagen , suggesting some degree of specificity for 
targeting the spatial collagen architecture of the matrix.6 
Clinical outcome  will be assessed at MRI follow -up time points using: The Knee injury 
and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS)  questionnaire is a standard clinical tool used to 
evaluate short -term and long -term symptoms and function in subjects with knee injury and 
osteoarthritis. It is broken up into five subcategories: Knee symptoms, knee pain, Function in 
daily living (ADL), F unction in Sport and Recreation (Sport/Rec), and knee -related Quality 
of Life (QOL). The KOOS is a validated, reliable and responsive self -administered 
instrument that can be used for short -term and long -term follow -up of osteoarthritis and will 
given to o ur patients to evaluate the effect of the unloading braces. The KOOS incorporates 
the commonly used WOMAC survey.  
Tegner activity level scale will be used to establish standardized activity levels pre and post 
treatment.  VR-[ADDRESS_1179224] symptoms with activities of daily living. VAS 
(Visual Analog Scale)  will be used to determine the level of patient pain at each visit.  
 
 
 
 
  
Schedule of Appointments  
Visit  1 (T=0)  
Visit [ADDRESS_1179225] operative visit .  
Participants will undergo the informed consent process.  Once signed, participants will 
answer standardized questionnaires (see above), get fitted for the brace  (if in bracing group) , 
and undergo baseline MRI scans and x -rays to evaluate alignment.  Wearing of the brace will 
commence at the time of weight bearing, which will occur immediately post -operatively in 
Centre 2 (Japan) and [ADDRESS_1179226] operati vely at Centre 1 ([LOCATION_003]).  
Brace fitting  
Each participant will be fitted by a licensed orthotist for the Unloader brace.  
 
Imaging  
Each participant will undergo a pre-study series of X -rays that are standard for osteoarthritis 
examination.  This series consists of a front -view (AP) X -ray of the knees, a sideways 
(lateral) view, and a one with the knee flexed at 45° (Ros enberg).  There will also be a long 
standing X -ray (36") that w ill film the lower extremities. These films will measure any mal-
alignment  present.  
A MRI scan during the first visit will examine cartilage physiology.  The scans will take 
place at the Stanford Medical Outpatient Center or Stanford Medical Lucas Imaging Center  
with a 3T scanner.  Subjects will undergo 2D-T2 mappi[INVESTIGATOR_007] , 3D-T2 mapp ing, and 3D -T1rho 
mappi[INVESTIGATOR_007] .  The se scans take approximately 12, 10, and [ADDRESS_1179227] be reprogrammed; a ll participants will 
therefore undergo five iButton swaps. These visits will be managed by [CONTACT_848191]. The fin al iButton will be obtained at V isit 2.  iButton  data 
files will be post -processed by [CONTACT_848192].  These values will be compared with the bracing diaries completed by [CONTACT_181456].  
Visit 2 (T=6  Months)  
Visit two will consist of quantitative  MRI scans conducted at the Stanford Medical 
Outpatient Center or the  Stanford Lucas Imaging Center .  The patient will also complete the 
same standardized questionnaires as in the first visit.   
Visit 3 (T= 12  months)  
The patient will return  for another quant itative MRI  scan and to answer the standardized 
questionnaires.  
Visit 4 (T= 24  months)  
The patient will come back again for a final  MRI  mappi[INVESTIGATOR_848189].

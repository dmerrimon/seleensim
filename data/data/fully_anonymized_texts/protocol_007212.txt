1.1 Background  
Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is a common endocrine disorder, with an incidence of 
around 45 per 100,000 person years (1).  PHPT is characterized by [CONTACT_416351] (PTH) by [CONTACT_416352], leading to an elevated serum calcium concentration. Hypercalcemia can cause a wide variety of well -described symptoms 
ranging from constipation to osteoporosis and also increases the risk of mortality resulting from cardiovascular disease (2).  Diagnosis is typi[INVESTIGATOR_416348], with the finding of a 
relatively elevated serum calcium level with a concomitant inappropriately- elevated PTH level. 
In over 80% of cases, PHPT is caused by a single parathyroid adenoma.  The remainder of other causes includes multigland disease (either multiple adenomas or 4- gland hyperplasia) and 
very rarely parathyroid carcinoma (3).  Surgery is currently the only method of definitive cure as 
well as the most effective treatment modality overall.  Most patients with PHPT are surgical candidates, but particularly if they are symptomatic or younger than 50 years of age (4).  In the 
majo rity of cases, the method of surgical intervention has shifted over the past 2 decades, 
evolving from extensive bilateral neck exploration to a more minimally invasive parathyroidectomy (MIP) approach (5).  MIP has been made possible by [CONTACT_416353] (localize) the abnormal 
gland( s), which in turn have allowed surgeons to perform limited, targeted explorations, with its 
attendant benefits to shorter operative time, lower complication rate, and smaller incision length 
(2). Most centers including U CSF routinely perform a combination of neck ultrasound and Tc -
99-sestamibi scan (with or without fusion SPECT -CT) for first -time, non- reoperative cases. The 
diagnostic value of single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT/CT) in predicting the localiz ation of the adenoma has been proven to be the best imaging modality in comparison to 
normal SPECT, dual -phase planar scintigraphy and subtraction scintigraphy (6-8).  However, 
even SPECT/CT fails to identify the gland in up to 30% of the cases (9).  These cases mandate 
the traditional bilateral neck exploration, with its abovementioned attendant disadvantages compared to MIP.  
1.2 18F-fluorocholine for parathyroid adenomas 
Recently, a case report was published describing a potential new imaging modality for patients with pHPT.  Quak et al. reported the incidental finding of a parathyroid adenoma using 18F -
Fluorocholine (FCH) PET -CT in a patient suspected of recurrence of prostate cancer (10).  
Choline is part of the phospholipid layer in the cell membrane; it is hypothesized that hyperfunctioning parathyroid cells have an increased activity of the phospholipid/Ca2+ -
dependent protein kinase which would lead to increased choline uptake and in turn greater imaging accuracy of PET detection with radiolabeled choline such as FC (11).  Since then three 
studies with preliminary results have been published showing a superior detecting rate of FCH PET- CT over different types of conventional imaging in both patients with PHPT and secondary 
hyperparathyroidism (12-14).  Although these initial results with FC have been encouraging, the 
total body of evidence is still very small and more research is needed.

eight  patients who have undergone surgery, the offending parathyroid adenomas were identified 
intraoperative at exactly the location indicated by [CONTACT_416354] -up.

8.2 Definitions of Adverse Events 
8.2.1  Adverse Event 
An adverse event (also known as an adverse experience) is defined as any untoward medical 
occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related.  More specifically, an adverse event  (can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g., 
 
Version date: 3/25/2019  IRB# 16 -[ZIP_CODE] 
Phase III – 18F-fluorocholine   Page 12 of 23  an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a 
drug, without any judgment about cau sality.  An adverse event can arise from any use of the 
drug (e.g., off -label use, use in combination with another drug) and from any route of 
administration, formulation, or dose, including an overdose.  
8.2.2  Adverse reaction 
An adverse reaction is defined as any adverse event caused by [CONTACT_2224] a drug.  Adverse 
reactions are a subset of all suspected adverse reactions for which there is reason to conclude that the drug caused the event.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Suspected  
A suspected adverse reaction is defined as any adverse event for which there is a reasonable 
possibility that the drug caused the adverse event. For the purposes of IND safety reporting, “reasonable possibility” indicates that there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the adverse event.   A suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree 
of certainty about causality than an adverse reaction.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Unexpected  
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered unexpected if it is not listed in 
the investigator brochure or package insert(s), or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed, or, if an investigator brochure is not required or available, is not consistent with the risk information descri bed in the general investigational plan or elsewhere in the current 
application.  
“Unexpected,” as used in this definition, also refers to adverse events or suspected adverse reactions that are mentioned in the investigator brochure as occurring with a cla ss of drugs or 
as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not specifically mentioned as occurring with the particular drug under investigation.  
Adverse events that would be anticipated to occur as part of the disease process ar e 
considered unexpected for the purposes of reporting because they would not be listed in the 
investigator brochure.  For example, a certain number of non -acute deaths in a cancer trial 
would be anticipated as an outcome of the underlying disease, but such deaths would generally 
not be listed as a suspected adverse reaction in the investigator brochure.  
Some adverse events are listed in the Investigator B rochure as occurring with the same class of 
drugs, or as anticipated from the pharmacological proper ties of the drug, even though they have 
not been observed with the drug under investigation.  Such events would be considered 
unexpected until they have been observed with the drug under investigation. For example, 
although angioedema is anticipated to occur in some patients exposed to drugs in the ACE inhibitor class and angioedema would be described in the investigator brochure as a class effect, the first case of angioedema observed with the drug under investigation should be considered unexpected for reporting purposes. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Serious 
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered serious if, in the view of either 
the investigator or sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes:  
• Death 
• Life-threatening adverse event  
 
Version date: 3/25/2019  IRB# 16 -[ZIP_CODE] 
Phase III – 18F-fluorocholine   Page 13 of 23  • Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_37511] 
• A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life function 
• Congenital anomaly/birth defect  
Important medical events that may not result in death, are life -threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Life-threatening 
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered life-threatening  if, in the view of 
either the investigator or sponsor, its occurrence places the patient or subject at immediate risk of death. It does not include an adverse event or suspected adverse reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
8.3 Recording of an Adverse Event 
Data about these events and their severity will be recorded using the NCI CTCAE v4.0.  The 
Investigator will assign attribution of the possible association of the event with use of the investigational drug:  
Relationship  Attribution  Description  
Unrelated to investigational drug/intervention Unrelated  The AE is clearly NOT related to the 
intervention  
Unlikely  The AE is doubtfully related to the intervention  
Related to investigational drug/intervention Possible  The AE may be related to the intervention  
Probable  The AE is likely related to the intervention  
Definite  The AE is clearly related to the intervention  
 
Signs or symptoms reported as adverse events will be graded and recorded by [CONTACT_40607].  When specific adverse events are not listed in the CTCAE they will be 
graded by [CONTACT_416356], mild , moderate  or severe  according to the following grades 
and definitions:  
 
Version date: 3/25/2019  IRB# 16 -[ZIP_CODE] 
Phase III – 18F-fluorocholine   Page 14 of 23  Grade 0  No AE (or within normal limits)  
Grade 1  Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated  
Grade 2  Moderate; minimal, local, or noninvasive intervention (e.g., packing, cautery) 
indicated; limiting age -appropriate instrumental activities of daily living (ADL)  
Grade 
3: Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3111]; disabling; limiting self -
care ADL 
Grade 
4: Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated  
Grade 
5: Death related to AE  
8.[ADDRESS_524545] (IRB); and, when the study is conducted under an 
Investigational New Drug Application (IND), to the Food and Drug Administration  (FDA)  if it 
meets the FDA reporting criteria.  
8.[ADDRESS_524546] report events  meeting the UCSF IRB definition of “Unanticipated 
Problem” (UP) within 5 business days of his/her awareness of the event.  
Expedited Reporting to the Food and Drug Administration  
If the study is being conducted under an IND, the Sponsor -Investigator is responsible for 
determining whether or not the suspected adverse reaction meets the criteria for expedited  
reporting in accordance with Federal  Regulations (21  CFR §312.32).  
The Investigator must report in an IND safety report any suspected adverse reaction that is both 
serious and unexpected.  The Sponsor -Investigator needs to ensure that the event meets all  
three definitions:  
• Suspected adverse reaction  
• Unexpected  
• Serious  
If the adverse event does not meet all three of the definitions, it should not be submitted as an expedited IND safety report. 
 
Version date: 3/25/2019  IRB# 16 -[ZIP_CODE] 
Phase III – 18F-fluorocholine   Page 15 of 23  The timeline  for submitting an IND safety report to FDA is no later than 15 calendar days  after 
the Investigator determines that the suspected adverse reaction qualifies for reporting (21 CFR 
312.32(c)(1)).  
Any unexpected fatal or life -threatening suspected adverse reaction will be reported to FDA no 
later than 7 calendar days  after the Investigator’s initial receipt of the info rmation (21 CFR 
312.32(c)(2)).  
Any relevant additional information that pertains to a previous ly submitted IND safety report will  
be submitted to FDA as a Follow -up IND Safety Report without delay, as soon as the 
information is available (21 CFR 312.32(d)(2)).  
 
9 Statistical Considerations and Evaluation of Results 
9.1 Statistical Design 
We will enroll a total of 140 patients (65 in our initial cohort, on which t he sample size estimate 
is based).  The sample size will be based upon comparison to setamibi SPECT (MIBI).  Multiple 
meta -analysis of MIBI SPECT have been performed and demonstrate a sensitivity ranging 79 to 
84% for MIBI SPECT  (15,16).  This detection rate is higher than we see at our  institution since 
we are a referral center for patients who have previously failed parathyroidectomy, where the study has a lower sensitivity.  For the purpose of our analysis we will do our sample size assuming a sensitivity of 70%, which mirrors our pra ctice.  At an 87% power with an alpha level 
of 0.05, we estimate that a sample size of 65 patients would be needed, assuming 100% disease prevalence, 70% accuracy of MIBI (sestamibi), an estimated 85% accuracy of FCH PET, and 10% dropout rate.  
9.2 Analyses Plans 
At the time of the imaging study, each scan will be interpreted by a nuclear medicine physician, 
who will be fully cognizant of the clinical, imaging and laboratory data.  Focal uptake on choline PET will be reported by [CONTACT_157478] (left/right, location wi th respect to the thyroid, or description of 
location if atypi[INVESTIGATOR_2855]), along with measured SUVmax.  These reads will not be used for evaluation of the primary endpoint. 
9.2.[ADDRESS_524547] certified nuclear medicine readers in a random order at separate reading sessions.  Prior to interpretation a training data set using choline PET studies not included in the study will be used to train the readers.  Clinical information will not be 
available to the readers at time of interpretation.  Cross sectional imaging from the PET will be 
available for anatomic correlate, but no other imaging study will be available. Each study will be characterized by [CONTACT_157478] (left/right, location with respect to the thyroid, or description of location 
if atypi[INVESTIGATOR_2855]).  “Atypi[INVESTIGATOR_2855]” refers to adenomas that are not in the thyroid bed and would include the 
mediastinum.  All  suspected lesions as well as the single most suspi[INVESTIGATOR_416349].  For example , in the setting of multiple parathyroid adenomas, one lesion will be 
reported by [CONTACT_416357][INVESTIGATOR_15665].   
 
Version date: 3/25/2019  IRB# 16 -[ZIP_CODE] 
Phase III – 18F-fluorocholine   Page 16 of 23  The location of each adenoma that is surgicall y confirmed will be marked in the identical fashion 
(left/right, location with respect to the thyroid  [ie inferior or superior], or description of location if 
atypi[INVESTIGATOR_2855]).  For each reader, lesions will be characterized as follows:  
1. True positive: Location of  the suspected adenoma on FCH PET correlates with location 
of an abnormal parathyroid at time of surgery.   For a patient with multiple hyperplastic 
glands, only one gland needs to correlate for the patient to count as a true positive.  
a. For analysis, adenom as described as arising in the mid thyroid bed will 
considered correct if located in either the inferior or superior bed.  
2. False positive: Location of the suspected adenoma on FCH PET does not agree with 
location of an abnormal parathyroid at time of surge ry.   
3. True negative: There are no true negatives as patients with primary hyperparathyroidism 
have near 100% incidence of hyperplastic adenomas. 
4. False negative: No evidence of parathyroid adenoma on FCH PET independent  of 
findings at time of surgery.  
9.2.2  Sestamibi evaluation 
In patients who had a sestamibi study performed prior to the fluorocholine imaging study, we will 
use the original dictated report from the sestamibi.  This will be done as there may be significant bias in the interpretation of the sestamibi studies if re- interpreted .  Identical to the PET data, the 
study reports,  will be used to characterized location (left/right, location with respect to the 
thyroid, or description of location if atypi[INVESTIGATOR_2855]).  All suspected lesions as well as the single most suspi[INVESTIGATOR_416350]. The sensitivity from this analysis will be used as our comparator for the FCH PET. For each reader, lesions will be characterized as follows:  
1. True positive: Location of the suspecte d adenoma on sestamibi correlates with location 
of an abnormal parathyroid at time of surgery.   For a patient with multiple hyperplastic glands, only one gland needs to correlate for the patient to count as a true positive.  
a. For analysis, adenomas describe d as arising in the mid thyroid bed will 
considered correct if located in either the inferior or superior bed.  
2. False positive: Location of the suspected adenoma on sestamibi does not agree with 
location of an abnormal parathyroid at time of surgery.   
3. True negative: There are no true negatives as patients with primary hyperparathyroidism 
have near 100% incidence of hyperplastic adenomas. 
4. False negative: No evidence of parathyroid adenoma on sestamibi independent of 
findings at time of surgery.  
 
The perform ance of the imaging modalities will be quantified by [INVESTIGATOR_67124], specificity, positive 
predictive value and negative predictive value.  
Performance will be assessed using surgery as the gold standard with postoperative 
normalization of calcium as the study endpoint as described above.  For this study to have a 
positive outcome, two of the three FCH PET readers have to have a sensitivity that is 10% 
greater than that of sestamibi imaging.   For statistical analysis we will use the McNemars’s test with a p-v alue of 0.05 for significance.  We will also compare the sensitivity of 18F -fluorocholine 
to the predetermined detection sensitivity of 70%.  Again, two of the three FCH PET readers have to have a sensitivity that is 10% greater than 70% (ie 80%).  We will  also report an 
interreader variability for the FCH PET reads using a Fleiss’s Kappa.  The baseline characteristics will be reported as follows: continuous parametric data will be reported as mean 
 
Version date: 3/25/2019  IRB# 16 -[ZIP_CODE] 
Phase III – 18F-fluorocholine   Page 17 of 23  +/- standard deviation, continuous non -parametric data as medians with interquartile range.  
Dichotomous data will be reported as proportions.  Patients with missing imaging results or 
missing data on the primary endpoint will be excluded from the study.

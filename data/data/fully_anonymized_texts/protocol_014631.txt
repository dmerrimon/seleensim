Exempt From IRB Review     Not Applicable      Ventilatory suppression in children following opi[INVESTIGATOR_131035], especially following routine surgicalprocedures (i.e. adenotonsillectomy). It is thought that patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) have increased sensitivity toopi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], and especially in opi[INVESTIGATOR_2583]ïve patients. Recent evidence in adults suggests that patients with moderate to severe OSAmay not predispose patients to increased opi[INVESTIGATOR_131036]. It is well known that OSA in children is significantly different from OSA in adults (e.g. gender predilection, centralvs. peripheral causation). The manifestation and etiologies are very different in pediatric OSA making it a vastly different diseaseprocess. The aim of this study is to identify if children with known OSA experience opi[INVESTIGATOR_131037].      The sole objective in this study is to evaluate if routine amounts of opi[INVESTIGATOR_131038] E1.

ChildrenVulnerable populations require special protections.  How will you obtain informed consent, protect subject confidentiality, and preventundue coercion?     Parents will be approached as ask to participate in the study. They will be informed that this is completely voluntary and that theycan choose to avoid participation and or revoke their participation at any point.

Procedure
     Patient Identification The Principal and/or co-investigators will identify children meeting enrollment criteria from the daily operativelist at [LOCATION_007] Childrens Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_131042]. Those meeting enrollment criteria will be approached by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_131043]-investigators. Control Group: -Patients requiring tonsillectomy/adenotonsillectomy without suspected OSA Children presenting for tonsillectomy/adenotonsillectomy for recurrent infection. Children with negative sleep studies will be included. Those without formal sleep studieswill be screened using the OSA 18 questionnaire, a validated clinical assessment score for pediatric sleep‐disordered breathing.Those with negative questionnaire scores will be included. Study Group: -Patients with Moderate to Severe OSA as documented by [CONTACT_131056], patients willbe included if they have undergone formal sleep study evaluations. Stratification will be based on the polysomnography testingusing the apnea hypopnea index (AHI) and or the number desaturation events according to the McGill Scoring system for pediatricOSA. Patients with AHI greater than [ADDRESS_148048] moderate to severe OSA and thus eligible for inclusion All patients will undergo general anesthesia per the usual practice at [LOCATION_007] Childrens Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_131046]. Induction will be with sevoflurane+/-nitrous oxide followed by [CONTACT_131057].Endotracheal intubation using a RAE endotracheal tube will be performed with the size selected using the formula: Predicted SizeCuffed Tube = (Age / 4) + 3. Following endotracheal intubation, spontaneous ventilation will be maintained without the use ofcontinuous positive pressure. Sevoflurane will be reduced to maintain between 0.5-0.7 MAC according to the Drager Apolloanesthesia machine. The patient will be allowed to establish their respi[INVESTIGATOR_131047] 3 minutes following intubation on0.21% oxygen. Baseline tidal volume (TV), respi[INVESTIGATOR_697] (RR) and end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO2) will be recorded. fentanyl1mcg/kg will be administrated as a bolus (usual clinical practice). The TV, RR, ETCO2 will be recorded, at 5 and 10 minutesfollowing opi[INVESTIGATOR_40499]. Apnea or desaturation <92%) will be treated by [CONTACT_131058] (standard practice).After 10 minutes,(to study a repeated dose effect) a second dose of 1/mcg/kg will be administered with the same TV, RR, ETCO2recorded for [ADDRESS_148049] practice will occur the research portion will be prospectively recording the TV, RR, ETCO2 following opi[INVESTIGATOR_131048] (pre-opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]). routine fentanyl administration for these procedures is 2 mcg/kg G1.  Sample SizeHow many subjects (or specimens, or charts) will be used in this study?     Local: 50              Worldwide: 50Please indicate why you chose the sample size proposed:     Our sample size is based on a recent 2019 landmark paper investigating a similar question in adults with obstructive sleep apneawe propose to enroll 20 control patients and 30 patients with documented obstructive sleep apneaG2.  Data AnalysisProvide a description of your plan for data analysis. State the types of comparisons you plan (e.g. comparison of means, comparisonof proportions, regressions, analysis of variance). Which is the PRIMARY comparison/analysis? How will the analyses proposed relateto the primary purposes of your study?     The primary outcome will be measurement of continuous variables of tidal volume, respi[INVESTIGATOR_131049]2. these will bereported as means with SD. regression analysis will be performed for patients falling into the moderate and severe categories ofobstructive sleep apnea by [CONTACT_131059]. Describe and assess any potential risks/discomforts; (physical, psychological, social, legal, or other) and assess the likelihood andseriousness of such risks:     The risks include loss to confidentiality and we will reduce this risk by [CONTACT_131055] [INVESTIGATOR_6254]-investigators collect data which willbe stored only on the BCM firewall. Additionally, there is a risk of apnea with all opi[INVESTIGATOR_131050]. There is no long term follow up or patient related efforts required to participate. Describe potential benefit(s) to be gained by [CONTACT_30435] a result of participating in the planned work.     There is no planned benefit for the patient enrolledDescribe potential benefit(s) to society of the planned work.     the societal benefit is understanding the impact of opi[INVESTIGATOR_131051]. The risk of opi[INVESTIGATOR_131052]? Discuss the risk-to-benefit ratio.     This study is a risk category 3, moderate risk which in this case is apnea.

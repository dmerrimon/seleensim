Clinical Study Protocol  
Study Title:  Imagio Feasibility Multi -Reader, Multi -Case Study of Optoacoustic 
Images versus Imagio Ultrasound to Guide Decision to Biopsy  
Study Type:  Single arm, controlled, blinded, multi -reader , multi -case  study  
Study Identifier:  Reader Study -01 
Study Phase:  Feasibility  
Study Object ive: To determine the design and sample size required for the p ivotal study   
Indication:  The Imagio™ breast imaging system is indicated for use by  a trained and 
qualified healthcare provider for evaluation of breasts in women who are referred for a diagnostic breast work -up (including both palpable and non-
palpable masses), following clinical presentation, mammography, 
diagnostic, screening , or staging methodology.   In ultrasound mode,  the 
device can be used to assess BI -RADS1 -6.  For BI-RADS 3 -
5 lesions,  the ultrasound mode should be initially used to assess the 
lesion before moving to OA. In Opto -Acoustic (OA) mode, the Imagio™ 
provides information about the central nidus, boundary and peripheral 
zones to assist in the assessment of BI -RADS category and diagnosis of 
the benign or malignant lesion(s) of interest. Using OA and the 
corresponding features of the lesion(s) allows for improved classification 
of the mass of interest as compared to ultrasound alone  in BIRADS 3 -5 
masses.  
This device is not intended to be used as a replacement for 
mammographic screening or for definitive pathologic diagnosis.

masses as strata.  
4.  STUDY DESIGN  
This will be a single arm, controlled, blinded, multi -reader, multi -case (MRMC) study  
using a sequential design.  The study will include 5 -12 readers  depending on 
qualifications and availability . 
Imagio (IUS+OA)  Training to be completed prior to any reads taking place.   Read 1 is 
immediately followed by [CONTACT_217224] 2 within the same read session.  
• Read 1 (Control) : Mammo gram (if available)  + History + IUS (stills and videos 
provided) , IUS Probability of Malignancy ( POM ) and BI -RADS scored  and the data 
form locked .  
• Read 2 (Test) : Mammo gram (if available)  + History + IUS (stills and videos 
provided), and Imagio (IUS+OA)  (stills and videos provided) .  An interim IUS POM 
and BI -RADS is recorded as well as a combined Imagio (IUS+OA) POM and BI -
RADS Pre and Post SenoGram on separate data forms .    
Read [ADDRESS_260788] 
ultrasound images , taking under consideration the mass and patient history and 
assessing  mammogram results  as available.  The History details to be provided are 
summarized under the Blinding section of the protocol . Read 1 (IUS reads) wi ll serve  as 
the control  representing current clinical practice.  Read 2 (IUS+OA) will be considered the 
test read and reflect a pre SenoGram IUS and Imagio (IUS+ OA) POM and BI -RADS 
assessment in addition to a post Seno Gram IUS and Imagio (IUS + OA) POM and BI -
RADS assessment .  Following the display of the SenoGram within the Post SenoGram 
data form , the IUS and OA  feature scores are locked,  and the reader is prompted to 
provide a Post SenoGram POM and BI -RADS.  Once the Post SenoGram POM and BI -
RADS  are provided, the form is locked.   
A total of 1 55 complete read sets from the original PI[INVESTIGATOR_217191]- to Diagnose (ITD) 
population will be random ly selected from within the PI[INVESTIGATOR_217192].   
• Comprising the [ADDRESS_260789] of 75 benign and 45 
malignant  masses (reflecting the same 37.5% prevalence of cancer as for the overall 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_217193]) , classified by [CONTACT_217225] ( CDU)  as BI -
RADS [ADDRESS_260790] a proportion with and without 
mammograms  depending on availability of the mammograms , separately for benign 
and malignant masses .  Cohort 1 will be used for the effectiveness endpoint  
analyses in support of  decision making . The same sampling strategy will be used to 
ensure a co mparable proportion of mass image sets as for the PI[INVESTIGATOR_217194].  
Imagio Feasibility Reader Study Protocol  Confidential

 • The second cohort  consists of 30 additional malignant masses for which 1 or more 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_217195] a f alse negative during a read from the 
PI[INVESTIGATOR_217196] ; this will assess if the excess FN rate observed with OA in the 
PI[INVESTIGATOR_217197].   
• The third cohort will consist of five DCIS, lymphoma, or Phyllodes masses ; this will 
assess how these atypi[INVESTIGATOR_217198].  Since there are so few of  these 
cases, m ammogram  matching will not be possible.     
This evaluation will further achieve the following:  
1. The incremental contributions  of IUS and Imagio (IUS+OA)  by [CONTACT_217226] -
RADS and POM values at each step in the read order traditionally used in clinical 
practice.  
2. The SenoGram  performance versus  IUS and versus  Imagio (IUS+OA)  once IUS + 
OA features are scored  with subset evaluation of the effect of presence or absence 
of the mammographic data on Senogram performance.  
The SenoGram  is a classification model that predicts the probability that a lesion is 
malignant for a given set of reader -assigned feature scores and other relevant data.  For 
this study, the SenoGram  will consist of two components, a user interface and a back -
end computati on engine.  The reader will enter feature data into the user interface.  
When all data has been entered, but prior to a final submission of the data, the user 
interface will graphically display the model’s predicted likelihood of malignancy  [not to be 
confused with POM] .   
 
The SenoGram figure will also display threshold lines that correspond to estimated 
sensitivities of 98%, 98.5%, 99%, and 99.5% , in relationship to the boundaries between 
BI-RADS categories. If the reader changes a feature score, the graphical display will 
automatically update with the revised prediction.  The reader may optionally modify his or her BI -RADS and POM assignments based on the SenoGram  predication; however, 
there is no requirement to do so.   The use of the SenoG ram result in decision making 
will be recorded for each reader for each image mass set evaluated.   The SenoGram is 
trained on cases not selected for any Cohort of this study .

7.0    READER STUDY PROC EDURES   
7.1 Reader Study Process Work Flow  
Figure 1 below illustrates, at a high level, the central reader study process flow. Seno 
Medical will electronically transfer image sets to ACR -CRI. Upon receipt of the images at 
ACR CRI, imaging support staff will upload images to Tr ansfer of I mages and D ata 
[TRIAD], ACR’s electronic image submission tool.  
The images automatically undergo a de -identification process in TRIADTM, whereby [CONTACT_217230] -identified according to 
TRIADTM’s anonymization profile. If any personal identifiers are burned into exams 
received, ACR CRI staff will remove that by [CONTACT_21173][INVESTIGATOR_217204]. ACR- CRI imaging 
technologists will first perform quality control (QC -1) to document an  inventory of all 
exams  and their attributes .   
Imagio Feasibility Reader Study Protocol  Confidential  
November 1, 2018  – Version 3.0 Page 14 of 29 
 ACR- CRI contracted multiple mass quality control reviewer  will assess the image sets 
(QC-2) for inclusion by [CONTACT_217231] [ADDRESS_260793] case where multiple masses are present . The acceptable image sets from 
the ACR QC (QC -1 and QC -2) process will be approved by [CONTACT_217232].  
BBRF will generate the study mass randomization scheme for the study.  
The QC-1 and QC -2 checks  will be documented in study specific procedure documents 
and outputs  of such checks documented on study specific forms, all of which will be 
archived in an electronic Trial Master File (eTMF)  and ACR CRI clinical databases . 
ACR research staff serving as read monitors will be present during read sessions to 
ensure the read sequence is maintained, eCRFs are fully completed by [CONTACT_73700] , 
cross- check the assigned read list with completed eCRFs and assist in any workstation -
related questions. The r ead monitors will relay any issues they cannot resolve to the 
ACR Project Manager for remediation.  
For the Feasibility Reader Study, a manual process of data entry will be performed. In 
order to maximize both workflow efficiency and data integrity, this process will be 
achieved by [CONTACT_217233] a read monitor, working together as 
a team.  Both the reader  and the r ead monitor will be trained on the data entry process 
prior to production subject case assessments.  The process of data entry is outlined 
below.   
1. Read m onitor calls out the Read ID to be reviewed based on the provided Reader  
Work List.  The reader  opens the Subject image case in the image viewing 
workstation. The read monitor opens the Subject eCRF case in the Rave Electronic 
Data Capture (EDC) Database. The reader  calls out the Subject ID for the opened 
case as confirmation that it corresponds to the Subject ID opened in the eCRF 
database by [CONTACT_941] r ead monitor.  
2.   Reader  performs the specified subject’s image review using the des ignated 
Workstation and following assessment criteria as trained on for this study.   
3. Read monitor prepares to perform data entry for the specified subject.  
4. When the reader  is ready to provide the data for data entry, the reader  verbally 
notifies the read monitor.  
5. The reader  verbally provides the answers to each of the eCRF required field entries.  
6. As the r ead monitor performs the manual data entry for each of the sequential fields 
directed by [CONTACT_217234], the read monitor verbally calls  out their entry which 
is then verbally confirmed (or corrected, as necessary) by [CONTACT_73700] . 
7. This process will be repeated until all the appropriate fields for each of the required 
eCRFs are completed.  
The reader  electronically signs off on the data for a subject case at the completion of 
his/her review. It is understood that the commitment of a reader ’s electronic signature [CONTACT_217249]/edits need to occur.  
Imagio Feasibility Reader Study Protocol  Confidential  
November 1, 2018  – Version 3.[ADDRESS_260794] scan review is  completed by a reader , the reader  provides their electronic

Upon completion of all central read assessments by [CONTACT_217235], ACR -CRI will transfer 
the readers’ results to Seno Medical’s portal . BBRF will have access to the portal for 
purposes of conducting the statistical analyses.

November 1, 2018  – Version 3.[ADDRESS_260796] training and Imagio (IUS+OA)  training,  each of the reader s 
will use an image display and electronic data capture workstation to perform image 
analysis, working alongside an ACR Read Monitor, for all reading  session s. Each reader  
and read monitor will be in a designated, private reading  room for their use during a 
reading  session. Reader s will work undistracted so that their attention is focused on an 
accurate interpretation. The workstation desk will have adjustable height for reader  
comfort, the room will be equipped w ith noise abatement features, diagnostic display 
monitors and moderate illumination. As part of reader  training and as documented in the 
confidentiality agreement they sign during the ACR CRI contracting process, readers will be aware and monitor ed to maintain confidentiality on study details and subject images 
reviewed. Access to the reading rooms is controlled and read monitors ensure reader s 
do not take any unauthorized material into the reading rooms.  
7.4 Graphical  Interface for BI -RADS Category and POM  Rating;  
For the purpose of this study, the Readers will use a graphical interface to indicate their 
assessment of the BI -RADS category and POM rating for IUS and Imagio (IUS+OA) 
modalities (see

 8.  SAFETY ASSESSMENTS  
Safety assessments are not required as this is a reader study of de -identified Imagio 
(IUS+OA)  and IUS images. No patient diagnoses are affect ed by [CONTACT_217236].     
9.  STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
9.[ADDRESS_260798] mammography use and site CDU BI -RADS score.   
BBRF will determine which masses are to be assigned to each cohort;  Cohorts 1-[ADDRESS_260799] pre- specified 
POM evaluations separately for IUS and then for Imagio ( IUS+OA ) and the Senogram to 
evaluate the primary and secondary effectiveness endpoints.  Pre -specified POM 
evaluations will be performed separately for IUS, Imagio (IUS+ OA), and the reader use 
of the SenoGram to evaluate the Imagio (IUS+ OA) and SenoGram specifici ties and 
sensitivities.  
The primary endpoint is to show a specificity advantage for fixed sensitivity; this diffuses 
the tradeoff between FNs and FPs if the FN rate is the same.  These sensitivity and 
specificities will be calculated overall and per reader  using generalized estimating 
equations (GEE)  and the analysis of variance ( ANOVA)  modeling as well as for 
observed without adjustment .   
For each endpoint, Imagio will be compared versus  IUS; t he same analyses will be 
performed for the SenoGram versus  IUS and Imagio.   
The specificity advantages will be computed for fixed sensitivity (e.g. 98% target) with 
interpolati on or extrapolati on used by [CONTACT_217237].  This same principle will  be used to construct the partial ROC 
curves and to compute the area under the ROC curve to correspond to 95- 99% 
sensitivity.  
The results from the Feasibility Study will be used  to judge if there is sufficient rationale 
to proceed to a pi[INVESTIGATOR_217205].  If there is sufficient strength of the data, then the Imagio Feasibility 
Study results will be used to determine the pi[INVESTIGATOR_217206].  The effect sizes 
will be assessed to judg e if the pi[INVESTIGATOR_217207] 80% power 
for two -sided hypothesis testing with 5% Type I error; this depends on the effect sizes 
achieved for the primary and secondary effectiveness endpoints as well as inter -reader 
variabilities.   
Feasibility Study data will not be used or combined with any subsequent pi[INVESTIGATOR_217208],  but the same masses used in the Feasibility Study may be used in the subsequent 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_2397].   
The Feasibility Study will not test any formal statistical hypotheses but will be used to 
formulate hypotheses to be formally tested in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_2397].  
Imagio Feasibility Reader Study Protocol  Confidential  
November 1, 2018  – Version 3.[ADDRESS_260800] decision will be made based on  the collective performance of the 
primary and secondar y effectiveness endpoints  using Cohort 1 (75 benign masses and 
45 malignant masses). Cohort [ADDRESS_260801] sizes to power the subsequent pi[INVESTIGATOR_2397] .   
Every effort will be made to identify missing reads and to provide readers with the 
opportunity to read all 1 55 image sets  which includes the  two additional cohorts:  
• Cohort 1: 120 masses (75 benign, 45 malignant ) to represent the PI[INVESTIGATOR_217209]  
• Cohort 2: 30 additional malignant masses with FNs  
• Cohort 3:  5 DCIS, lymphoma and p hyllodes  masses .  
All reads will be included in all analyses, consistent with an “intention  to diagnose ” 
approach.   
9.4  Population Definition  
The original PI[INVESTIGATOR_217191]- to-diagnose  classification will be used.  Images will be 
selected for use in accordance with the study protocol inclusion  and exclusion criteria.  
9.5 Interim Analyses  
An interim ana lysis of the data is planned to follow  a completion of a minimum of 72 
completed  Cohort 1 mass reads  by [CONTACT_217238] 2 to assess intermediate 
performance results.  
9.6 Protocol Deviations  
The study data will be evaluated for major and minor protocol deviations. This will be 
limited to missing and incomplete reads from the Feasibility Study.   
At study completion, the number and type of protocol deviations will be analyzed by [CONTACT_217239]. The bio statis tician will report findings to the study sponsor .  
The findings will be used to improve the p ivotal study design in the event that the p ivotal 
study is to proceed.  
9.7 Outcomes  
Outcomes will be analyzed according to the PI[INVESTIGATOR_217210] (if available) as truth; Truth Panel Benign (TPB) will be a benign 
diagnosis.   The final analyses  will be performed following database lock .  
9.[ADDRESS_260802] v10 or later unless otherwise specified.  
Imagio Feasibility Reader Study Protocol  Confidential  
November 1, 2018  – Version 3.0 Page 19 of 29 
 All significance testing will be two- sided; results will be presented using two- sided p-
values and two- sided 95% confidence intervals.  All p-values are considered to be 
descriptive.  
Methods of analysis for the MRMC design will be analyzed treating readers as random 
effects and treatment and masses as fixed effects and also by [CONTACT_217240] (see references ). Two -sided 95% confidence intervals will be computed for the Imagio 
(IUS+OA)  as well as  Imagio  (IUS+OA)  - versus  IUS differences in ROC AUC and the 
differences in downgrade and upgrade percentages separately for benign and malignant 
masses. The same analyses will be performed for the SenoGram versus  IUS and versus  
Imagio (IUS+OA).   These outcomes will be used to guide decisions regarding pi[INVESTIGATOR_217211].    
For each endpoint, Cohort [ADDRESS_260803] the respective ROC curves  for IUS , the Imagio (IUS+OA)  and the 
SenoGram .  GEE and ANOVA will be used to describe overall specificity and sensitivity 
as well as to compute the two- sided 95% confidence intervals for the OA -IUS differen ces 
for sensitivity and for specificity.  
The specificity advantage for fixed sensitivity will be the primary endpoint.  It will be 
computed from the respective ROC curve s which are generated according to the POMs 
corresponding to the 95- 99% sensitivity range.  To compute the specificity advantage for 
fixed sensitivity, interpolation may be required; a fixed sensitivity will be targeted, e.g. , 
98%.  To compute the specificity advantage and the partial area under the ROC, the 
specificities and sensitivities m ay need to be further computed from the ROC curves as 
needed.  The McClish method will be used to analyze and compare the partial ROC 
curves.   The variances will be computed to construct the two- sided 95% CIs for Imagio 
(IUS+OA) , IUS, and for the Imagio (I US+OA) -IUS difference.  The same analyses will 
be performed for the SenoGram versus  IUS and versus  Imagio (IUS+OA).  
In addition, the interpolation and the corresponding variance estimate will also permit the 
calculation of the specificity difference for fixed sensitivity (e.g. 98%) as well as the two-
sided 95% confidence interval for the difference.     
2. Upgrades and Dow ngrades  
Separately for benign + TPB masses and malignant  masses, downgrades and upgrades 
will be jointly assessed for each diagnostic category using a McNemar paired 
comparison test for  Imagio (IUS+OA) versus  IUS.  In addition, two- sided 95% confidence 
intervals will be computed for the OA -IUS differences for both specificity and sensitivity; 
superiority will be sought for specificity while non- inferiority will be sought for sensitivity.

3. Move Forward Criteria 
The move forward criteria will be dependent  on data from the above endpoints .  As 
illustration, the following criteria would justify conducting the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_112688]:  
• An Imagio (IUS+OA) specificity  advantage versus  IUS for fixed sensitivity;   
• An Imagio (IUS+OA) specificity advantage with a minimal OA sensitivity 
disadvantage;   
• An Imagio (IUS+O A) advantage for benign mass downgrades with a minimal 
Imagio  (IUS+ OA) disadvantage for malignant mass upgrades.   
The same analyses will be performed for the SenoGram versus  IUS and versus  Imagio.  
Depending which criteria are selected for inclusion as pi[INVESTIGATOR_217213], 
the pi[INVESTIGATOR_217214] 80% power with two- sided 5% Type I error; 
there are 1,757 masses available from the PI[INVESTIGATOR_217215].  
4. NLR 
The NLR ((1 -sensitivity)/specificity) will be computed using the standard formula with 
two-sided 95% CIs computed using exact 2x2 contingency table methods.  A two- sided 
95% CI for the NLR <1 and favoring OA will indicate improvement in NLR; the relative 
NLR will also be computed relative to IUS.  The same analysis will be performed for 
SenoGram versus  IUS and versus  Imagio (IUS+OA) . 
5. Graphical Displays  
The BI-RADS findings f or Imagio and SenoGram will be displayed separately for benign 
masses  using three separate scales (0- 2%, 2 -50%, 50-100%) to better represent reader 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_217216].  The 0- 2% scale will be on an expanded scale to 
allow the readers to more precisely identify the respective POM for Imagio and likelihood 
of malignancy for the SenoGram .

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a common and morbid complication of diabetes. Poor 
glycemic control underlies most cases of diabetes and CKD , but clinicians and patients have 
virtually no high-quality information to guide glucose management once this develops. Diabetes 
and CKD fundamentally alters the ascertainment and treatment of hyperglycemia due to changes in hemoglobin kinetics, limitations to the menu of available medications, decreased catabolism of insulin and oral hypoglycemic medications, and – in end stage renal disease – direct effects of 
renal replacement therapy on blood glucose and insulin secretion. This constellation of changes is widely believed to increase the risk of hypoglycemia, which may in turn contribute to the markedly elevated levels of systemic inflamm ation and oxidative stress observed in diabetes and 
CKD  and the high rates of arrhythmia and sudden death observed in this population. New 
medications that lower glucose with reduced risk of hypoglycemia are insufficiently evaluated among patients with CK D, who have frequently been excluded from clinical trials.  
This is a proof-of- concept clinical trial testing the effects of linagliptin versus glipi[INVESTIGATOR_146698] [ADDRESS_167848] 6 days of each 28-day treatment period . Secondary outcomes include indices of glycemic 
variability, hypoglycemia, and biomarkers of systemic inflammation, oxidative stress, and albuminuria. The overall goal of this research is to identify safe and effective treatments to control glycemia among patients with diabetes  and CKD.

1. Study Objectives  
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a common and 
devastating complication of diabetes. Specifically, albuminuria or reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR) occurs in approximately 40% of patients with type 2 diabetes and markedly increases risks of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and death. Poor glycemic control underlies most cases of diabetic CKD, but clinicians and patients have virtually no high-quality information to guide glycemia management once CKD develops. CKD fundamentally alters the ascertainment and treatment of 
hyperglycemia due to changes in hemoglobin kinetics, limitations to the menu of available medications, and decreased catabolism of insulin and oral hypoglycemic medications. This constellation of changes is widely believed to increase glucose variability and the risk of 
severe hypoglycemia, which may in turn contribute to the markedly elevated levels of systemic inflammation and oxidative stress and the high rates of CVD and death observed among people with diabetes and CKD. New medications that lower glucose with reduced risk of hypoglycemia are insufficiently evaluated among patients with CKD, who have been frequently excluded from clinical trials.  
The overall goal of our research is to improve the management and clinical outcomes of 
patients  with diabetes and CKD. The goal of this study is to test whether a dipeptidyl 
peptidase -4 inhibitor, compared with a sulfonylurea, improves time in normoglycemia and 
reduces glycemic variability and hypoglycemic exposure.  
Hypothesis a:  Linagliptin, compar ed with glipi[INVESTIGATOR_7130], increases time in normoglycemia and 
decreases glycemic variability and hypoglycemic exposure, at a similar level of mean glycemia.  
Hypothesis b:  Linagliptin, compared with glipi[INVESTIGATOR_7130], reduces systemic inflammation, 
oxidative stress, and albuminuria, at a similar level of mean glycemia.  
2. Background and Rationale 
2.1. Chronic kidney disease is common. Chronic kidney disease (CKD), defined by [CONTACT_146718] (“albuminuria”) and/or impaired glomerular filtration rate (GFR),1-4 is a 
tremendous problem from the perspectives of individual patients and the public health. CKD 
occurs in 40% or more of patients with type 2 diabetes.1-6 We demonstrated that the prevalence 
of diabetes and CKD in the [LOCATION_002] increased by 34% to 6.[ADDRESS_167849] 20 years, driven by [CONTACT_146719] ( Figure 1 , manuscript included 
with application).
6 Diabetes is the leading cause of end stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring 
dialysis or kidney transplantation in the developed world.[ADDRESS_167850] National Health and 
Nutrition Examination Survey linked to the National Death Index, we found that kidney disease 
V. 4/24/[ADDRESS_167851] all excess mortality risk in type 2 diabetes.10 Specifically, kidney disease 
was associated with markedly increased 10- year cumulative mortality, particularly among people 
with diabetes, but diabetes was not associated 
with increased mortality risk absent kidney disease ( Figure 2 ). These data expand on work by 
[CONTACT_146720], independent, and additive risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and death among persons with diabetes.
11-16 
2.3. Kidney disease fundamentally alters glucose homeostasis, increasing the risk of 
hypoglycemia. Impaired GFR leads to a number 
of important perturbations in glucose homeostasis. These include decreased insulin catabolism, impaired metabolism and excretion of glucose- lowering medications (leading to 
prolonged sulfonylurea half-life and a contraindication to metformin use), decreased renal gluconeogenesis, malnutrition (in advanced DKD), and a blunted counter- regulatory response. 
1-
4,17-[ADDRESS_167852] that these changes lead to increased risk of hypoglycemia. Moen et 
al reported that inpatient and outpatient veterans with diabetes and CKD experienced double the incidence rates of laboratory glucose <70 mg/dL compared to veterans with diabetes and normal estimated GFR.
22 Glucose <70 mg/dL was associated with markedly increased short -term 
mortality. A recent population-based Canadian study of diabetes and CKD reported a U- shaped 
association of hemoglobin A1c with all- cause mortality, again suggesting adverse effects of 
hypoglycemia.[ADDRESS_167853] trial, albuminuria and reduced estimated GFR (even with 
limited ranges) were associated with markedly increased risks of hypoglycemia, particularly with intensive glucose-lowering.
[ADDRESS_167854] facilitated the use of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) for clinical care and research.
34,[ADDRESS_167855] become the gold 

V. 4/24/[ADDRESS_167856] for measuring average glycemia and glycemic variability in high -quality studies such as 
the A1c-Derived Average Glucose (ADAG) Study,37-[ADDRESS_167857] ( Table 1 ).43-51 These 
studies demonstrated that CGM is accurate in the sett ing of even advanced. In comparison, a 
larger, more detailed study with longer periods of CGM could additionally define glycemic 
variability and ascertain the determinants and consequences of hypoglycemia in CKD.

2.7 Linagliptin is shown to reduce blood glucose in Type 2 diabetes patients.  Linagliptin is 
a dipeptidyl peptidase- 4 (DPP -4) inhibitor proven to reduce blood glucose among patients with 
type 2 diabetes and normal GFR, with an incidence of clinical hypoglycemia that is lower than 
that of sulfonylureas (SU).
63 Linagliptin is primarily eliminated through non -renal routes and 
does not require dose adjustment with impaired GFR. In CKD, fixed-dose Linagliptin reduces hemoglobin A1c (compared with placebo) without a significant increase in clinically -recognized 
hypoglycemia.

2.8. Summary: why we should study glycemia in people with diabetes and CKD now.   It is 
critical to optimize treatment among patients with type 2 diabetes and CKD because they represent a large population at markedly increased risk of CVD and death. Risks and be nefits of 
glucose- lowering strategies may differ in CKD because CKD fundamentally alters glucose 
homeostasis and its ascertainment and treatment. In particular, hypoglycemia and its biologic sequelae may be particularly common and detrimental in this population. However, virtually no high-quality data are available to guide glucose management in patients with CKD. CGM offers 
a novel opportunity to define fundamental aspects of impaired glucose homeostasis in CKD, including glycemic variability and hypoglyce mia incidence rates, risk factors, and sequelae. 
Moreover, application of new diabetes treatments to patients with CKD may help prevent hypoglycemia in this high -risk population. 
3. Study Methods  
3.1 Overview This is a proof-of- concept clinical trial testing the effects of linagliptin versus 
glipi[INVESTIGATOR_146699] 2 diabetes and stage 3- 4 CKD. 
Linagliptin is a dipeptidyl peptidase -4 (DPP -4) inhibitor proven to reduce blood glucose among 
patients with type 2 diabetes and normal GFR, with an incidence of clinical hypoglycemia that is lower than that of sulfonylureas (SU).
63 Linagliptin is primarily eliminated through non -renal 
routes and does not require dose adjustment with impaired GFR. In CKD, fixed- dose Linagliptin 
reduces hemoglobin A1c (compared with placebo) without a significant increase in clinically -
recognized hypoglycemia.64,65 We hypo thesize, among patients with type 2 diabetes and CKD, 
that Linagliptin, compared to Glipi[INVESTIGATOR_7130] (a SU), will increase glucose time in range ( TIR) 
(ascertained using CGM) while reducing glycemic variability and time below range  (TBR ) and 
exerting similar effects on mean glycemia. Results may have direct implications for patient care, suggesting that use of linagliptin as a SU -sparing agent may improve patient safety, and will 
provide a useful framework for future studies targeting gly cemic control while minimizing 
hypoglycemia in the CKD population. 
3.[ADDRESS_167860] successfully completed a crossover trial of 
similar size and duration with excellent recruitment and retention.
66 The main limitation of cross -

treatment period extend into the subsequent treatment period(s). Because the effects of 
linagliptin and glipi[INVESTIGATOR_146700], we have little concern for carry-over effects on glucose as measured by [CONTACT_28047], ou r primary outcome. (Hemoglobin A1c and other longer- term 
glycemic markers will only be evaluated in secondary, exploratory analyses.) Given rapid effects, we will have  short treatment periods (4 weeks), which will enhance retention and 
adherence. A wash -out phase is not appropriate for this study because carry- over effects are not 
expected and withdrawal of both glucose- lowering medications would lead to relative 
hyperglycemia  
3.3 Study population This clinical trial will enroll 24 participants with type 2  diabetes and an 
estimated GFR 15 -59 mL/min/1.73m
[ADDRESS_167862] eligibility to participants with hemoglobin A1c < 8%, for whom we expect substantial times in each of normoglycemia, hypoglyc emia, and hyperglycemia. Eligibility 
criteria is described in table 2. When available, eligibility laboratory data  will be obtained from 
the electronic medical record, or from the results of previous research studies (such as CANDY); values within [ADDRESS_167863] CANDY study visit. The 
CANDY study is a longitu dinal 
observational study of patients with type 2 diabetes and stage 3/ 4 CKD. The 
aims of CANDY are to characterize 
glucose variability, hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia using continuous 
glucose monitoring and to explore the biologic sequelae of glucose variability and hypoglycemia in diabetes with CKD. The inclusion and exclusion criteria for both CANDY and CANDY-CANE are similar , making CANDY 
participants ideal candidates for the CANDY- CANE trial.  
Should additional participants be required, we will recruit these patients through mecha nisms 
used for recruiting in the CANDY trial. For example, if needed we will recruit from Nephrology, 
Diabetes, and primary care clinics associated with the University of Washington, Harborview Medical Center, and Providence Medical Research Center/Sacred Heart Center in Spokane. 
Patients will be pre -screened through either the Mindscape or Orca computerized medical record 
system to access their records for limited information prior to obtaining their consent to determine eligibility. We will approach these  potential participants at clinic visits after 
introduction by [CONTACT_146722] a mailed invitation postcard. In addition, we will advertise this study to patients seen in other Seattle -area Nephrology and Diabetes clinics Table 2.  Eligibility criteria

refer for screening if they are interested . 
3.5 Intervention  Throughout the 8 weeks (total) of this trial, we will ask all participants to 
discontinue use of their prevalent SU but maintain other glucose -lowering medications (e.g. 
insulin) at unchanged doses. We will then prescribe linagliptin for [ADDRESS_167864] and maximize patient safety. However, data for the primary study outcome (time in range measured by [CONTACT_28047]) will masked to participants, and study staff and investigators will be given 
only coded treatment assignments (“A” and “B”) until data analyses are completed. In this setting, lack of participant blinding is unlikely to bias results.  
4. Study procedures.    
Each participant will undergo blinded CGM for the last 6 days of each 4-week treatment period ( Figure 3 ). During each CGM period, participants 
will also be asked to self -monitor blood glucose concentrations, and 
blood and urine samples will be collected for measurements of inflammation, oxidative stress, and albuminuria. 
 4.1. Continuous glucose monitoring.  We will use Medtronic Enlite glucose sensors coupled to iPro2 recorders 
(Figure 4 ). The Enlite  is an advanced  glucose sensor, offering accurate 
glucose monitoring over days of use.  An Enlite will be provided to participants at study visits 2 and 4. Study 
staff will insert the sensor into the subcutaneous tissue of the abdomen with the use of a 
disposable introducer needle. The sensor is attached to the iPro2 recorder, which with its predecessor (iPro recorder) has proved reliable in numerous clinical studies as a masked glucose 

V. 4/24/[ADDRESS_167865] 3 n onfasting blood samples will be collected at study 
visits 3 and 5. Whole blood, serum and plasma samples will be aliquoted, and stored at -80°C as per Kidney Research Institute protocols. Spot urine collections will also be collected from 
patients at study visits 3 and 5. 
4.4. Inflammation and oxidative stress. Oxidative stress and inflammation are increased in diabetes and in chronic kidney disease and are likely to contribute to the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease. We chose to measure two established markers of oxidative stress and two 
established markers of inflammation f or this study. In addition, banked samples will be available 
for novel cardiovascular biomarker assays that are currently under development or will be developed in the future. Plasma and urine F
2-isoprostanes (biomarkers of oxidative stress) will be 
measured by [CONTACT_27199] -MS as initially described by [CONTACT_146723]69 in the University of 
Washington Mass Spectrometry Core Resource. As biomarkers of inflammation, plasma C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations will be determined by [CONTACT_146724] -6 will be measur ed by [CONTACT_6428] (Biosource International) in the KRI laboratory. 
4.5. Hemoglobin A1c and other measurements of glycemic control. Hemoglobin A1c will be measured in real time by [CONTACT_65570] (UW) Clinical Laboratory and  repeated 
by [CONTACT_146725]. Measurement at UW is by [CONTACT_5004], and quality control is verified 
daily with results calibrated to the DCCT laboratory as recommended by [CONTACT_146726]. At the University of Missouri, Hemoglobin A1c will be measured using the Tosoh G8 analyzer, which employs an ion- exchange HPLC method and is one of the NGSP Secondary Reference 
Laboratory methods. The G8 is one of the most precise instruments for HbA1c analysis available and has shown long term CV at the University of Missouri of <0.5%.  Hemoglobin A1c poorly reflects glycemic variability and therefore may not correlate well with risk of hypoglycemia.
38 
Moreover, existing evidence suggests that hemoglobin A1c correlates with average glycemia poorly in patients wit h kidney disease). Therefore, we will also measure glycated albumin and 
fructosamine concentrations. Glycated Albumin will be measured at the University of Missouri using the Lucica GA -L enzymatic glycated albumin assay kit on the [COMPANY_002] C311 analyzer (CV 
3-5%). Fructosamine will be measured at the University of Missouri using the [COMPANY_002] Fructosamine assay on the [COMPANY_002] C311 analyzer (CV 3-5%). 1,5- anhydroglucitol will be 
measured at UW using an enzymatic colorimetric assay (GlycoMark)  
V. 4/24/[ADDRESS_167866] will be administered a medical history questionnaire.  Height, weight 
and vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate) will be taken. The subject will be assigned the order of 
study medications  and the first medication will be prescribed.  The subject will pi[INVESTIGATOR_146701]. Adverse effects will be assessed.

5. Statistical analysis 
5.1 Data analysis. All analyses will be performed according to intention -to-treat, meaning that 
all participants who contribute data during treatment with linagliptin and glipi[INVESTIGATOR_146702]. The primary study outcome will be glucose time in range (TIR, proportion of CGM glucose readings 70- 180 mg/dL), a clinically 
relevant outcome that can be tested with high power because of its broad anticipated range within the study population and precise ascertainment using CGM.
35,70,71 We will summarize 
time in range by [CONTACT_15500], along with secondary outcomes including TBR (< 70 mg/dL), hypoglycemia characteristics (epi[INVESTIGATOR_146703], nadir glucose, awareness, clinical severity), time above range ( TAR ), standard deviation of blood glucose concentration, mean 
blood glucose concentration, biomarkers of inflammation and oxidative stress, and urine albumin excretion rate. We will test differences in these outcomes by [CONTACT_146728] (for continuous outcomes, using log transformation as needed) or using Poisson regression (for rate data) . Models will be adjusted for mean CGM blood glucose to account for 
potential differential effects of linagliptin and glipi[INVESTIGATOR_146704].  
5.2 Power.  Using the cross -over study design, two-sided alpha of 0.05, and glucose time in range 
(TIR quantified as proportion of time) as primary outcome, and assuming a TIR standard 
deviation of 19.5% (similar to published values
70,71) and within-person correlation of TIR 0.7, we 
calculated a need for 24 participants (each studied on linagliptin and on glipi[INVESTIGATOR_146705]) to detect a 
10% difference in TIR between treatment assignments with 90% power. Notably, power depends on the difference in TIR between treatment groups, rather than mean TIR (which we expect to be between 25% and 50%), as long as mean TIR is not near zero. Because the effect size (10% difference in TIR) and within -person correlation of TIR are not known in this population, we 
also present power for different combinations of these variables using a fixed sample size of [ADDRESS_167870] deviation and for 
clinically relevant treatment effects.

  6. Safety and adverse events  
6.1.  Definitions 
6.1.1.  Adverse Event.  An adverse event (AE) is any symptom, sign, illness or experience that 
develops or worsens in severity during the course of the study.  Intercurrent illnesses or injuries should be regarded as adverse events.  Abnormal results of diagnostic procedures ar e considered 
to be adverse events if the abnormality:  
• results in study withdrawal 
• is associated with a serious adverse event  
• is associated with clinical signs or symptoms  
• leads to additional treatment or to further diagnostic tests  
• is considered by [CONTACT_1372]  
6.1.2.  Serious Adverse Event.  Adverse events are classified as serious or non -serious.  A 
serious adverse event is any AE that is:  
• fatal 
• life-threatening  
• requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408] 
• results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
• an important medical event 
Important medical events are those that may not be immediately life threatening, but are clearly of major clinical significance.  They may jeopardize the  subject, and may require intervention to 
prevent one of the other serious outcomes noted above.  For example, drug overdose or abuse, a seizure that did not result in in- patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or intensive treatment of bronchospasm in 
an emergency depar tment would typi[INVESTIGATOR_15355].  All adverse events that do not 
meet any of the criteria for serious will be regarded as non -serious adverse events.  
6.1.3.  Adverse Event Reporting Period.  Adverse events will be reported if they occur between the time that informed consent is granted through [ADDRESS_167871] to report any subsequent event(s) that the subject, or the subject’s personal physician, believes might reasonably be related to participation in this study.  The investigator will notify the study sponsor of any death or adverse event occurring at any time after a subject has discontinued or terminated study participation that may reasonably be related to this study.  The sponsor will also be notified if the investigator should become aware of the development of cancer or of a congenital anomaly in a subsequently conceived offspring of a subject that has participated in this study.  
V. 4/24/2015  14 6.1.5.  Abnormal Laboratory Values.  A clinical laboratory abnormality will be documented as 
an adverse event if any one of the following conditions is met:  
• The laboratory abnormality is not otherwise refuted by a repeat test to confirm the abnormality 
• The abnormality suggests a disease and/or organ toxicity  
• The abnormality is of a degree that requires active management; e.g. change of dose, discontinuation of the drug, more frequent follow-up assessments, further diagnostic investigation, etc.  
6.1.6.  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], Prolonged Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_146706].  Any adverse event that results in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_43355] a serious adverse event u nless specifically instructed otherwise in this protocol.  Any condition 
responsible for surgery will be documented as an adverse event if the condition meets the criteria for and adverse event. Neither the condition, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], nor surgery are reported as an adverse event in the following circumstances: 
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_68034] a preexisting condition.  Surgery should not be reported as an outcome of an adverse 
event if the purpose of the surgery was elective or diagnostic and the outcome was uneventful. 
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14842]. 
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_146707], 
unless it is a worsening or increase in frequency of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14844].  
V. 4/24/[ADDRESS_167872], the investigator will seek 
information on adverse events by [CONTACT_5147], as appropriate, by [CONTACT_5148].  Information on all adverse events will be recorded immediately in the source document, and also in the appropriate adverse event module of the case report form.  All clearly related signs, 
symptoms, and abnormal diagnostic procedures results will be recorded in the source document.  All adverse events occurring during the study period will be recorded.  T he clinical course of 
each event will be followed until resolution, stabilization, or until it has been determined that the study treatment or participation is not the cause.  Serious adverse events that are still ongoing at the end of the study period will be followed up to determine the final outcome.  Any serious adverse event that occurs after the study period and is considered to be possibly related to the study treatment or study participation will be recorded and reported immediately.  
6.3.  Reporting of Serious Adverse Events.   Reports of all serious adverse events with a 
reasonable possibility of being related to the study (including follow- up information) will be 
submitted to the IRB , according to the IRB policy, within 10 working days.  Copi[INVESTIGATOR_1309] e ach 
report and documentation of IRB notification and receipt will be kept in the Clinical Investigator’s binder.  Adverse events with a reasonable possibility of being related to the study which are not serious will be reported to the IRB as components of annual reports.  Because this is an observational study, no data safety and monitoring board will be created for this trial.  Adverse events and recruitment will be monitored by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_146708], as described above.  
7. Data Handling and Record Keepi[INVESTIGATOR_007]  
7.1.  Confidentiality.  Information about study subjects will be kept confidential and managed 
according to the requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA).  Those regulations require a signed subject authorization informing the subject of the following:  
• What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from subjects in this study  
• Who will have access to that information and why 
• Who will use or disclose that information  
• The rights of a research subject to revoke their authorization for use of their PHI.  
In the event that a subject revokes authorization to collect or use PHI, the investigator, by [CONTACT_5151], retains the ability to use all information collected prior to the revocation of subj ect 
authorization.  For subjects that have revoked authorization to collect or use PHI, attempts will be made to obtain permission to collect at least vital status (i.e. that the subject is alive) at the end of their scheduled study period. 
7.2.  Records R etention.   All study data will be de -identified and stored in secured electronic 
files and/or a locked file cabinet within a locked room.  Data including personal identifiers (i.e. 
screening data) will be kept separately in a secure, locked location .

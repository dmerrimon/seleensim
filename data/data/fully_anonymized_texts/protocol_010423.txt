1. Summarize your proposed changes.
0 participants enrolled to date. We intend to incorporate the knowledge gained from the pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] (IRB
[ZIP_CODE])for this study prior to starting recruitment.
Proposed changes below.
Resources: Section a has been updated. Ken Weingardt, Amer Raheemullah, and Ashley Lee have been
removed.
Main Protocol Adjustments:
1)Removing PEth tests (biomarker of alcohol use )from the project . This affects General Checklist (#5),
Resources section c on PO Box, Protocol Information sections 2a, 8, 9, 11, ICF.
2)Removing MINI interviews from the project. This affects section 2a, 8, 11, ICF.
3)Section 2a: Added potential recruitment sources (also affects Resources e, and section 8g ). Added Data
Flow wording from IRB [ZIP_CODE] (pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] ).
4)Section 3a background: Updated background info with preliminary data from pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] (IRB [ZIP_CODE] ).
5)Sample size proposed for this study has been updated from [ADDRESS_386098] been
updated. Justification for increase in sample size: The team has decided not to use the data for the FDA as a
pi[INVESTIGATOR_16076]. This decision simplifies the study consenting process (Part 11 and Adobe Sign )and the
assessment schedule (i.e., droppi[INVESTIGATOR_313641] ). These changes greatly reduce personnel time and
research costs and enable us to direct resources to increasing the sample size to permit greater diversity in our
sample and testing of subsample effects of interest (i.e., differences in treatment outcomes by [CONTACT_547], alcohol
as the primary substance, and by [CONTACT_545]/ethnicity ).
6)Section 8c updated with wording from IRB [ZIP_CODE] (pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] ).
7)Sections 8k, 13, 15, and [ADDRESS_386099] been updated.
Section 16 attachment updates:
1)Updated documents to the version in IRB [ZIP_CODE]: EdOnly Week 6 document, Debrief doc 7.21.21, DSMB
Minutes and Slides from 6.16.21, Email template for Education Only Group Intervention Content
2)Removed documents related to the MINI and PEth test collection.
3)Updated questionnaires based on approved questionnaires (modified 7.22.21 )from IRB [ZIP_CODE]. Changes
tracked.
4)Updated group instructions based on version in IRB [ZIP_CODE]. Changes tracked.
5)Updated and added templates.
6)Attached additional recruitment materials.
7)Attached Woebot letter regarding 21 CFR Part 11 Compliance.
Consent form:
1)The ICF has been updated based on the approved ICF for IRB [ZIP_CODE] (pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] ).
2)Protocol Information Section 11a )Added line "Informed consent will utilize Stanford's Adobe Sign
platform and procedures for part 11 compliance."

Approval Period: 04/13/2022 - 05/12/[ADDRESS_386109]. Prochaska's team has extensive experience in recruiting research participants who use substances,
including for online studies and has published on best practices.
f) Access to resources if needed as a consequence of the research.
State whether you have medical or psychological resources available that participants might require as
a consequence of the research when applicable. Please describe these resources.
Study informed consent will state that Woebot (the app being used to deliver the intervention )is not a crisis
program designed to address active suicidal ideation or overdose. Woebot also conversationally informs
first time users that it is not a crisis service. Our current safety net protocol will be adapted for this study.
Woebot detects crisis language and asks to confirm it with the user. If the user confirms, Woebot offers
resources (911, suicide crisis hotlines ), carefully curated with expert consultation. Our data indicate that
users do not use Woebot for crisis management; about 6.3 %trigger the safety net protocol, with 27 %
confirming that it is indeed a crisis when Woebot asks to confirm (i.e., our true positive rate ). To make sure
that we do not miss any cases, we over detect, rather than under detect. In addition, we periodically check
the data for true/false positive rates.
Foreseeable risks to subjects include the possibility that some assessment questions and/or treatment
procedures may be upsetting to subjects. Experience at Stanford with similar populations has indicated that
the risk of emotional upset during the assessments is low and if it occurred, the upset would likely not be
serious in nature and temporary. Such risks will be minimized by [CONTACT_38347].
Potential participants will also be informed that they may drop out of the study at any time and if requested,
appropriate treatment referrals would then be given.
g) Lead Investigator or Coordinating Institution in Multi-site Study.
Please explain (i)your role in coordinating the studies, (ii)procedures for routine communication with
other sites, (iii)documentation of routine communications with other sites, (iv)planned management of
communication of adverse outcomes, unexpected problems involving risk to participants or others,
protocol modifications or interim findings.

a) In layperson's language state the purpose of the study in 3-[ADDRESS_386110] the comparative efficacy of the mobile-app based
substance use disorder program to reduce substance use relative to an education-only control condition,
which has no cognitive behavioral therapy and the content is not delivered through a conversational user
interface.
b) State what the Investigator (s)hope to learn from the study. Include an assessment of the importance of
this new knowledge.
The COVID-19 pandemic introduced significant, unprecedented, and
immediate psychological challenges to all, including individuals with
substance use disorders (SUDs). The impact upon individuals with SUDs
will be multifaceted and far reaching. In terms of physical health,
experts postulate that individuals with SUDs may be at greater risk of
mortality from COVID-19 given the variety of pre-existing physical
health conditions this group has traditionally faced (i.e., COPD,
cardiovascular disease, general poor respi[INVESTIGATOR_38324] ). In addition,
the pandemic will beget significant emotional and psychiatric disruption from the multifaceted impact of theProtocol # [ZIP_CODE] ( Modification ) PROTOCOL

available through a smartphone
application, that delivers evidence-based psychotherapeutics, empathy,
and emotional health psychoeducation. Woebot for Substance Use Disorders (W-SUDs )is a [ADDRESS_386113] University that aims to develop and
evaluate the evidence of the novel digital therapeutic, delivered by [CONTACT_38373] (AI)-powered,
automated conversational agent named Woebot which is embedded in the therapeutic W-SUDs.
Milestones for Phase I included the development (e.g., content and
engineering )of W-SUDs and pi[INVESTIGATOR_38325],
feasibility and acceptability among n=101 individuals with SUD.
Phase I (N=101)has concluded and a manuscript is in submission. In this study, W-SUDs was feasible to
deliver, engaging, and acceptable; and associated with significant improvements in substance use,
confidence, cravings, depression, and anxiety. Study attrition was high.
The supplemental study (W-C19 )is a randomized control trial with a wait-list control condition. This study
aimed to expand understanding of W-SUDs' performance among users experiencing SUDs whilst
contributing to our overall understanding of COVID-19's impact upon this population. The intervention had
concluded with N=[ADDRESS_386114] relative to an education-only control
condition. Primary outcomes will be measures of the quantity and frequency of substance use including,
number of substance use occasions, heavy drinking days (if applicable ), percent days abstinent.
Additionally, phase II will evaluate whether W-SUDs results in a greater reduction in substance-related
problems than Education Only control and explore: Does engagement with W-SUDs, relative to
education-only control (a)improve symptoms of depression and anxiety (b)improve work productivity (i.e.
reduce presenteeism/absenteeism ),(c)reduce cravings, (d)improve situational confidence. Phase II will
also allow the team to learn more about the population interested in digitally delivered interventions.
Impact
Immediate access to a digital therapeutic in a resource constrained,
social distance healthcare ecosystem amidst growing psychological
challenges in this already vulnerable and underserved population.
Elements of our W-C19 program have already been integrated into W-SUDs
because we felt that it was timely and appropriate to address users'
concerns about the pandemic and demonstrated that Woebot was
'intelligent' to the current crisis.
c) Explain why human subjects must be used for this project. (i.e. purpose of study is to test efficacy of
investigational device in individuals with specific condition; purpose of study is to examine specific
behavioral traits in humans in classroom or other environment )
The purpose of this study is to test the efficacy of a mobile-
application delivered substance use disorder intervention compared to an education only control group.Protocol # [ZIP_CODE] ( Modification ) PROTOCOL

2. Study Procedures
a) Please SUMMARIZE the research procedures, screening through closeout, which the human subject
will undergo. Refer to sections in the protocol attached in section 16, BUT do not copy the clinical
protocol. Be clear on what is to be done for research and what is part of standard of care.
Updated consent forms and HIPAA authorization will be uploaded before
the start of recruitment. Ads, questionnaires, etc. will be uploaded for review before recruitment begins.
Recruitment will be a joint effort by [CONTACT_38351]. Woebot may communicate the research opportunity through social
media channels, and third party recruitment groups (e.g. Splash Clinical, Map & Story, Clara Health ). The
Stanford team may recruit through Qualtrics panels, ResearchMatch, listservs, and contact [CONTACT_313647]. Working with [CONTACT_38396]'s research team
at Stanford, the Woebot team will take part in mappi[INVESTIGATOR_313643]'s IT team will lead the app programming (including build and quality control/de-bugging ). Woebot
will collect user data via the Woebot app (automatic process ), which will be provided to the Stanford team.
The Woebot team will participate in disseminating the study findings via publications and presentations.
Participants from recruitment channels will go through and
screening consent and eligibility screener, and if eligible, will be asked to participate in their randomized
group for 8 weeks and answer questionnaires administered at the beginning, mid-intervention (4-week ), end
of intervention (8-week ), and post intervention (12-week ). Informed consent form will appear after
screening eligible, and must be signed before the baseline survey can be accessed. Computer randomization
will occur after the baseline survey, and instructions for their group will be sent out. Woebot will rely on
Stanford University IRB for review of this study.
The Stanford team will lead the study evaluations including the study
measures, data collection (baseline and follow-ups at the 4-week, 8-week, and 12-week/[ADDRESS_386116]
treatment marks ), data analyses, and writing up of study findings for dissemination. Participants will be
randomized to condition via the online assessment platform, which has the functionality to allow
randomization to one of two groups. Those randomized to W-SUDs (group 1 )or education control (group 2 )
will see a private, email or study-only page pertaining to their group. To minimize bias and maximize study
validity, group blinding will be in place; Participants should not know what the other intervention involves.
Instructions will be provided for each group. A study debrief regarding group blinding will be provided to
participants after the final survey. If the final survey is not completed, the debrief will be provided a month
after the final survey was due.
Woebot is responsible for app management, study payments (e.g. purchasing Amazon e-gift cards for
participant compensation ). Participant management is on the Stanford side, including sending out the
compensation, kits, etc. If the participant ends up contact[CONTACT_313648] a study related
question, that message is passed on to the Stanford team or answered by [CONTACT_313649].
In order to better understand what specific W-SUDs content the
participants like, Lesson Completion Rates and Content Rating Metrics
will be analyzed. Descriptive statistics will be used for the
following scales: Usage Rating Profile Intervention (UPRI)-
Acceptability, Usage Rating Profile Intervention (UPRI)-Feasibility,
and Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ-8). Such descriptive
statistics will provide a summary index of how likable the content
and program was overall. Tests involving statistical significance will be used to assess the intervention's
impact from baseline to EOT.
Utilizing study results as described above, the research team
will learn the efficacy of a digital substance use therapeutic compared to an education only control group.Protocol # [ZIP_CODE] ( Modification ) PROTOCOL

The intent is to utilize and leverage what was learned in this study to provide an intervention in a time
where in person services are discouraged and to see if the intervention is more beneficial than a nonactive
treatment condition.
Data flow:
Participants provide data by [CONTACT_313650]. The Stanford team is the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_313644]. Emails are
shared with the Woebot team for the interventions, payment, and cross-checking for intervention
contamination (i.e. commercial Woebot app use, WSUDs program use but are supposed to be in Education
only group ). Intervention contamination information will be shared by [CONTACT_313651]. Participants also
provide data by [CONTACT_313652]. Woebot Labs will share user data with the Stanford team,
who will link the data to survey responses. The Stanford team will analyze the data and then share analyzed
data with the Woebot team.
b) Explain how the above research procedures are the least risky that can be performed consistent with
sound research design.
Given that the research aims to enroll a low-treatment seeking
population, we do not envisage that participation in the study will
be associated with elevated risk.
However, some risk is always present in studies that involve human
participants.
Such risk may include the following:
Risk from breach of protected health information.
Possibly the greatest risk is from a leak of health information. All
study data are gathered on a HIPAA compliant web platform that
resides behind Stanford security firewalls and has been tried and
tested by [CONTACT_38346], thus actual risk from
data breach for study data is low. In addition, the Woebot
application encrypts all message data exchanged between service users
and Woebot, and collects minimal protected health information.
Emails are hashed and not kept along side message data so that they
are not easily associated with each other. In addition, the product
recently became compliant with General Data Protection Regulations
(GDPR)in the European Union which entails a user-ownership model of
data protections.
Risk from answering questions that may be emotionally upsetting.
Experience at Stanford with similar populations has indicated that
the risk of emotional upset during the assessments is low and if it
occurred, the upset would likely not be serious in nature and
temporary. Such risks will be minimized by [CONTACT_38353]. Potential participants will also be informed that
they may drop out of the study at any time and if requested,
appropriate treatment referrals would then be given.
Risk of treatment avoidance due to engagement with either of the
randomized interventions. In both interventions it is explicitly
stated in the consent form that the service should not be used in place of traditional treatment. In the case of
the W-SUDs intervention, Woebot is designed to hold individuals accountable for pursuing additional
options in conditions of unchanged symptoms for a prolonged amount of time (4 weeks ). In addition,
Woebot will invite the user to consider what seeking additional services would look like.
c) State if deception will be used. If so, provide the rationale and describe debriefing procedures. Since

alteration of consent (in section 13 ). Submit a debriefing script (in section 16 ).
There will be intervention group blinding to maximize validity and minimize bias (i.e. reducing factors may
affect the study outcomes ). The research team does not know if W-SUDs is more effective than an
education only control group. Group blinding minimizes preconceived expectations for each group and
behaviors as a result of those expectations. To keep the group blinding effective, the groups are not fully
described in the consent form, the company involved is not named (will be obvious which is the new
intervention since the company makes a digital therapeutic mobile app with a chat bot ), and full details of
the group intervention a participant is randomized to will be provided after randomization.
A debrief document is attached in Section 16 and will be provided to participants after their study period.
For those who complete the final survey, it'll be provided by [CONTACT_313653]. For those who do not
complete the final survey, the information will be provided by [CONTACT_6968] a month after the final survey (at
12-weeks )is due. This is to allow sufficient opportunity for the final survey to be completed before the
timing of the final survey is considered "late". No participant will be given the debrief after the intervention
period at 8-weeks since the study will also be observing sustained change post-intervention (between
8-weeks and 12-weeks ).
d) State if audio or video recording will occur. Describe what will become of the recording after use, e.g.,
shown at scientific meetings, erased. Describe the final disposition of the recordings.
No audio or video recordings will occur.
e) Describe alternative procedures or courses of treatment, if any, that might be advantageous to the
participant. Describe potential risks and benefits associated with these. Any standard treatment that is
being withheld must be disclosed in the consent process and form. (i.e. standard-of-care drug, different
interventional procedure, no procedure or treatment, palliative care, other research studies ).
Alternative Treatments for SUDSs include in-person individual and

Narcotics Anonymous.
All alternative options will be provided if she/he/they wishes to
engage in an alternative treatment rather than the proposed study.
However, given that previous Woebot study results are promising, the
proposed line of treatments would appear to be appropriate and
acceptable interventions for SUDs.
No standard treatment is being withheld.
f) Will it be possible to continue the more (most)appropriate therapy for the participant (s)after the
conclusion of the study?
Yes
g) Study Endpoint. What are the guidelines or end points by [CONTACT_38354] (i.e. study drug, device, procedure )during the study? If one proves to be clearly more
effective than another (or others )during the course of a study, will the study be terminated before the
projected total participant population has been enrolled? When will the study end if no important
differences are detected?
The endpoint will be the follow-up 30 days after end-of-treatment. This will end their study participation
and study staff will do analysis.

it an optimal modality for SUDs treatment delivery; it offers
immediate, evidence-based tailored support in the patient's peak
moment of craving. An RCT demonstrated that Woebot had statistically
and clinically significant reductions in depression compared to a
control group, along with best in class app-engagement rates (mean=12
interactions in 14 days ). Woebot does not currently offer a SUDs
program, although 63 %of current users expressed interest in said
content. Woebot's current, substantial reach as a consumer app,
preliminary data indicating its high user engagement plus efficacy
to treat a psychological condition, posies it as an ideal platform
for a SUDs-focused, tailored, and immediately scalable digital
therapeutic.
In the Woebot-SUDs phase 1 (pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268])study, there are 2,450+ screening
attempts, indicating interest in a digital therapeutic CA on substance
use both nationally and internationally. 260 were screened out solely
for not residing in the U.S. W-SUDs was feasible to deliver, engaging, and acceptable; and associated with
significant improvements in substance use, confidence, cravings, depression, and anxiety. Study attrition
was high (50%). Future research will evaluate W-SUDs in a randomized controlled trial with a more diverse
sample and with use of greater strategies for study retention.
W-C19 study: COVID-19 offered a unique opportunity for research to consider outbreak levels and policies
in our analyses, and the potential for differential effects of a treatment for reducing substance use problems
during an infectious disease outbreak. There were 2468+ screening attempts, and [ADDRESS_386120] fared better than phase 1. Final retention rate for
4-week assessments is at 79.4 % (143/180 ). EOT retention rate is 84.4 % (152/180 ). Experiencing worsened
mental health symptoms during COVID-[ADDRESS_386121] (IRB [ZIP_CODE] ): Preliminary data from this study shows that there are
feasibility issues with the study including time demand on personnel, complications introduced with the
Adobe Sign process (multiple emails to each participant, difficulty with the secure email process, varying
delays between screening to consent to baseline survey ), MINI interviewing scheduling challenges, and
delays between baseline completion and randomization. Based on recruitment data so far, over 1574
screening attempts were made (responses at 0 %do not get recorded in Qualtrics ), with [ADDRESS_386122] passed, 23 (18%of the 128 )have signed informed consent, and [ADDRESS_386123] 30
days. 12 (71%of the 17 completing baseline survey )have completed the MINI interview.
The W-SUDs phase II study will evaluate the efficacy of W-SUDs in a large scale RCT relative to an
education-only control condition, where there is no active treatment. To diversify the sample, we will utilize
Qualtrics panels and set quotas. We'll utilize retention strategies in the W-C19 study to improve retention.

students, patients with certain cancer, patients with certain cardiac condition )and the reasons for
using such participants.
N=400 (nationally )will be invited to participate in this study and entered into the study on a rolling basis.
Inclusion criteria include: all genders aged 18-65 years, meet CAGEAID score of 2+ (WSUDs is designed
for substance use ); access to the apps on smartphone, be available and committed to engage with app and
complete assessments, be willing to provide working email address (to distribute incentives ), working
telephone number (for interview portion and follow ups ), and be literate in English (as educational materials
and W-SUDs conversational and video materials will be in English ). Exclusion criteria include: pregnancy
(as W-SUDs will not be specifically developed to address the unique needs of this population ), history of
severe drug/alcohol use, opi[INVESTIGATOR_38329]-assisted treatment, and suicide attempt or opi[INVESTIGATOR_313645].
b) State the age range, gender, and ethnic background of the participant population being recruited.
Recruitment efforts will seek to enroll a demographically diverse sample age 18-65. Substance disorders are
prevalent in individuals of all genders, therefore all genders will be recruited as participants in the proposed
study.
c) State the number and rationale for involvement of potentially vulnerable subjects in the study
(including children, pregnant women, economically and educationally disadvantaged, decisionally
impaired, homeless people, employees and students ). Specify the measures being taken to minimize the
risks and the chance of harm to the potentially vulnerable subjects and the additional safeguards that
have been included in the protocol to protect their rights and welfare.
These populations are not being targeted but are also not excluded from the study. Exception: Pregnant
women and children will be screened out.
d) If women, minorities, or children are not included, a clear compelling rationale must be provided (e.g.,
disease does not occur in children, drug or device would interfere with normal growth and
development, etc. ).
Exclusion of Pregnant Women: Pregnancy (as W-SUDs will not be specifically developed to address the
unique needs of this population ). Exclusion of Children. The proposed study will include individuals
between 18-65 years of age. Persons younger than 18 will not be included in the study, as the proposed
substance disorder treatments were not designed for nor tested among youth and the characterization of
SUD in youth differs in meaningful ways from that in adults. Given the small sample sizes for this pi[INVESTIGATOR_38334], the proposed research is focused on those aged 18 and
older.

c) Describe the planned procedures for protecting against and minimizing all potential risks. Include the
means for monitoring to detect hazards to the participant (and/or to a potential fetus if applicable ).
Include steps to minimize risks to the confidentiality of identifiable information.
Given that the research aims to enroll a low-treatment seeking population, we do not envisage that
participation in the study will be associated with elevated risk. We are not assessing suicidal ideation in our
questionnaires. During the eligibility screener, those who have had a suicide attempt within the past year
will be excluded from the study. It is not feasible to confirm the responses by [CONTACT_38362]. However, some risk is always present in studies that involve human participants.
Such risk may include the following:
1. Data Protection and Privacy: All study data are gathered on a HIPAA compliant web platform that resides
behind Stanford security firewalls and has been tried and tested by [CONTACT_38346], thus
actual risk from data breach for study data is low. All assessments, including the screening, four assessment
batteries, and mediator assessment will be administered via a HIPAA compliant survey administration tool
commonly used by [CONTACT_38363] (Qualtrics or REDCap ). Given the high data
protection safeguards embedded within Qualtrics or REDCap, there is little risk to the subject associated in
regards to their privacy and/or confidentiality.
Research material obtained from human subjects will involve behavioral and psychological assessments
including self-report questionnaires. All data will be obtained specifically for purposes of this research
project. Data that is obtained from the Qualtrics or REDCap assessments will be stored and protected withinProtocol # [ZIP_CODE] ( Modification ) PROTOCOL

the study at any time and if requested, appropriate treatment referrals would then be given.
3. Risk of treatment avoidance due to engagement with either of the randomized interventions. In both
interventions it is explicitly stated that the service should not be used in place of traditional treatment. In the
case of the W-SUDs intervention, Woebot is designed to hold individuals accountable for pursuing
additional options in conditions of unchanged symptoms for a prolonged amount of time (4 weeks ). In
addition, Woebot will invite the user to consider what seeking additional services would look like.
4. Risk of suicide: Woebot informs the participant that it is not designed for crisis service. Additionally,
Woebot detects crisis language (e.g. "want to kill" )and asks to confirm it with the user. If the user confirms,
Woebot automatically, in real-time offers resources (9-1-1, suicide crisis hotlines, referral to ER ). Woebot's
crisis detectors flags around 200 possible harm to self phrases, including about 10 misspellings and 5 slang
phrases. Woebot's data indicate that users do not use Woebot for crisis management; about 6.3 %trigger the
safety net protocol, of which 27 %confirm that it is indeed a crisis (i.e., for a true crisis rate of 1.7 %).
Woebot's algorithm is over-sensitive, designed to over-detect, rather than under-detect to make sure that
cases are not missed. Woebot staff periodically check the data for true/false positive rates. Additionally, if
anyone is developi[INVESTIGATOR_38335], it is best practice
to call 9-1-1 and/or go to the nearest ER.
d) Explain the point at which the experiment will terminate. If appropriate, include the standards for the
termination of the participation of the individual participant Also discuss plans for ensuring necessary
medical or professional intervention in the event of adverse effects to the participants.
The study will terminate once the 3-month period with all 400 participants has been completed and the
analyses run and submitted for publication.
Participants can refuse to participate at any time.
When we learn of a participant's adverse event, the team will report the adverse event and may follow up
with the participant for additional information. Resources will be offered. The EOT and 12-week surveys
includes questions that assess for SAEs. More details about adverse events are in section e.
e) Data Safety and Monitoring Plan (DSMP). See guidance on Data Safety and Monitoring.
A Data and Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP)is required for studies that present Medium or High risk
to participants. (See Overall Evaluation of Risk above ). If Low Risk, a DSMP may not be necessary.
Multi-site Phase III clinical trials funded by [CONTACT_38364] a Data Safety
Monitoring Board or Committee (DSMC or DSMB ). The FDA recommends that all multi-site clinical

also have a DSMB or DSMC.
The role of the DSMC or DSMB is to ensure the safety of participants by [CONTACT_38365], and to oversee the validity and integrity of the data. Depending on the degree of risk and the
complexity of the protocol, monitoring may be performed by [CONTACT_38366], a board

Describe the following:
What type of data and/or events will be reviewed under the monitoring plan, e.g. adverse events,
protocol deviations, aggregate data?
The Data Safety and Monitoring Plan will include Woebot's standard safety net protocol as well as a
Data Safety and Monitoring Board overseen by [CONTACT_38358]. Woebot's Safety Net Procedures
Study informed consent will state that Woebot is not a crisis program designed to address active suicidal
ideation or overdose. Woebot also conversationally informs first time users that it is not a crisis service.
Our current safety net protocol will be adapted for the proposed study. Woebot's crisis detectors flags
around 200 possible harm to self phrases, including about 10 misspellings and 5 slang phrases. Woebot
detects crisis language (e.g. "want to kill" )and asks to confirm it with the user. If the user confirms,
Woebot offers resources (9-1-1, suicide crisis hotlines ), carefully curated with expert consultation. Our
data indicate that users do not use Woebot for crisis management; about 6.3 %trigger the safety net
protocol, with 27 %confirming that it is indeed a crisis when Woebot asks to confirm (i.e., our true
positive rate ). To make sure that we do not miss any cases, we over detect, rather than under detect. In
addition, we periodically check the data for true/false positive rates. Adverse Events We do not
anticipate that the use of the interventions will increase risk as outlined above. In addition, there is a
limited capacity to detect adverse events (such as overdose, suicide attempt or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_38336] )unless explicitly voluntarily reported by [CONTACT_2299]. In the case Stanford
University and / or Woebot Labs becomes aware of an adverse event, the appropriate protocol, approved
by [CONTACT_38368]'s Institutional Review Board, will be immediately implemented.
This includes immediate notification of the IRB, DSMB, and NIH, and an immediate convening of the
DSMB to discuss requisite follow-up steps.
Identify who will be responsible for Data and Safety Monitoring for this study, e.g. Stanford
Cancer Institute DSMC, an independent monitoring committee, the sponsor, Stanford investigators
independent of the study, the PD, or other person (s).
To ensure the data protection and safety of research participants, Stanford University will serve as the
Data Coordinating Center for the study under the coordination of Drs. Biaocchi and Prochaska. They
will convene a group of three to serve as an oversight board with professional expertise in the area of the
study. [CONTACT_38396] is an expert in the field of addiction and substance use, and [CONTACT_38398] has
experience in managing data protections in the context of randomized clinical trials.

Approval Period: 04/13/2022 - 05/12/[ADDRESS_386139] will then
provide feedback on the data that they will wish to review at their subsequent meetings.
Specify triggers or stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_38337], or when some action is
required. If you specified this in Section 2g [Study Endpoints ], earlier in this application enter 'See
2g'.
Endpoints will be indicated by [CONTACT_38370] W-SUDs and educational intervention delivery at
8-weeks, the 12-week mark for WSUDs group (content will no longer be accessible ), data analysis and
interpretation, refinement of W-SUDs, and the end of the 3 month period (ending mark of the study ).
Indicate to whom the data and safety monitoring person, board, or committee will disseminate the
outcome of the review (s), e.g., to the IRB, the study sponsor, the investigator, or other officials, as
appropriate.
The proposed study has a dissemination plan that encapsulates two important arenas: 1 )
ClinicalTrials.gov compliance and 2 )Dissemination. ClinicalTrials.gov Compliance If the proposal is
successfully awarded, the applicant will ensure that the the trial's registration and results reporting
procedures are thoroughly managed. The trial will be registered promptly upon receipt of the award and
before the recruitment of human subjects. All informed consent documents will include specific and
thorough statements referring to the posting on ClinicalTrials.gov. At the conclusion of the study and
following analysis of the results, results will be reported as well, in compliance with the
ClinicalTrials.gov procedures. Woebot Labs has a protocol in place outlining the importance and details
of ensuring the ClinicalTrials.gov procedures are up to date. Dissemination of Research Both Stanford
University and Woebot Labs will facilitate with the dissemination of research. They will collaborate on
manuscript preparation and submission, as well as abstract submission and presentations at national and
international scientific and technology-oriented conferences.

The Protocol Director will be the only monitoring entity for this study.
Y This protocol will utilize a board, committee, or safety monitor as identified in question #2 above.
10. Benefits
a) Describe the potential benefit (s)to be gained by [CONTACT_38371], etc.
When evaluating the risks and benefits of the proposed study, it is believed that risks are relatively minimal
when compared to the potential therapeutic benefits that subjects are likely to receive. The benefits of
receiving W-SUDs include potentially reducing substance abuse, acquiring practical psychotherapeutic
skills(from cognitive behavioral therapy, motivational interviewing, dialectical behavior therapy, and
mindfulness ), and receiving psychoeducation about substance abuse. Participants who reduce substance
abuse may derive additional benefits should reduction in substance abuse be associated with other
psychological improvements such as interpersonal or occupational functioning. Study of the effectiveness of
this intervention will also benefit society more generally by [CONTACT_38372], utility, and cost-benefits of a W-SUDs, the first SUDs-focused digital therapeutic
delivered by [CONTACT_38373] (AI)-powered conversational agent.
The study allows the opportunity to expand understanding of W-SUDs' performance among this population
and will offer those in the WSUDs group immediate access to a digital therapeutic in a resource constrained,
socially distanced healthcare ecosystem to an already vulnerable and underserved population, who are likely
faced with readily growing psychological challenges.Protocol # [ZIP_CODE] ( Modification ) PROTOCOL

Privacy Protections
a) Describe how the conditions under which interactions will occur are adequate to protect the privacy
interests of participants (e.g., privacy of physical setting for interviews or data collection, protections
for follow-up interactions such as telephone, email and mail communications ).
All assessments, including the screening and the four assessment
batteries, will be administered via a HIPAA compliant survey administration tool commonly used by
[CONTACT_38363] (Qualtrics or REDCap ). Given the high data protection safeguards
embedded within Qualtrics and REDCap, there is little risk to the subject associated in regards to their
privacy and/or confidentiality.
Informed consent will utilize Stanford's Adobe Sign platform and procedures for part 11 compliance.
Research material obtained from human subjects will involve
behavioral and psychological assessments (including self-report
questionnaires ). All data will be obtained specifically for purposes of this research project. Data that is
obtained from the Qualtrics or
REDCap assessments will be stored and protected within Qualtrics or
REDCap. Data that is obtained via Woebot will be encrypted and stored on Amazon Web Services (AWS);
Woebot Labs data gathering and storage
procedures are compliant with both the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA )and
the European Union's General Data
Protection Regulation (GDPR)compliant. Only members of the research team (PI, Co-PIs, biostatistician,
research assistant )will have access to the data.
Confidentiality Protections
b) Specify PHI (Protected Health Information ). PHI is health information linked to HIPAA identifiers
(see above ). List BOTH health information AND HIPAA identifiers. If you are using STARR, use the
Data Privacy Attestation to ensure that your request will match your IRB-approved protocol. Be
consistent with information entered in section 15a.
Individual names, email addresses, mailing addresses, phone numbers, dates of birth, demographic
information (gender, biological sex,race/ethnicity, disability status ), IP addresses, geo location, survey, drug
use.
Drug Use Psychopathology
1. The Drug Abuse Screening Test 10 (DAST-10 ), a brief, 10-item
self-report measure adapted from the 28-item DAST, assesses
consequences related to drug abuse, excluding alcohol and tobacco. A
score of [ADDRESS_386141]-10 demonstrated discriminate validity between
individuals (i)with lifetime drug use disorders and those without and
(ii)who are current abusers and those who are former abusers. It also
has moderate level of test-retest and reliability as well as sensitivity
and specificity.
2. The Drug Abstinence Self-Efficacy Scale (DASE)is a 12-item
self-report scale, reflecting Bandura's (1986)cognitive-behavioral
self-efficacy theory, and is a shortened version of the original 20-item scale. The 20-item scale has shown to
be a reliable and valid measure of self-efficacy for drug use. The scale will be adapted to refer to use of both
drugs and alcohol, by [CONTACT_38376].Protocol # [ZIP_CODE] ( Modification ) PROTOCOL

3. The CAGE Adapted to Include Drug USE (CAGE-AID )was developed by [CONTACT_313655]. It's a brief instrument to measure problematic drug use. The CAGE-AID is designed to be an easy
yet effective way for primary care providers to determine if substance abuse exists and needs to be
addressed.
4. The Michigan Alcohol Screening Test (MAST), revised is a [ADDRESS_386143] has been
productively used in a variety of settings with varied populations.
5. The Short Inventory of Problems- Alcohol and Drugs (SIP-AD )is a clinically tested 15-item measure
developed by [CONTACT_38378].
6. The Quick Drinking Screen (QDS)by [CONTACT_313656] & Sobell (2003), is a brief and reliable measure of
drinking. Compared with the Timeline Followback (TLFB), the QDS collected similar aggregate drinking
data for four drinking variables in a clinical sample of alcohol abusers.
General Psychopathology
9. The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8)is a brief 8-item scale used to determine the severity of
depression in medical populations. The PHQ-8 has high reliability across populations.
10. The Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7 )is a brief self-report scale that identifies the degree to
which an individual may have generalized anxiety disorder. This scale has good internal consistency,
convergent validity with depression, stress, and anxiety, and is a valid and efficient tool for GAD screening
in clinical and general populations.
Employee Health
11. The Stanford Presenteeism Scale is (SPS-6)a six item measure derived from a [ADDRESS_386144] Questionnaire (C-PIQ)and the International COVID-[ADDRESS_386145] of COVID-19. These include
questions about COVID-19 in relation to their health, work, and lifestyle changes.

Title:  Multi -Level Interventions to Reduce Caries Disparities in Primary  
Care Settings  
Précis:  The study is a multi -site, multi -level, and multi -component cluster 
randomized clinical trial (RCT) to address poor dental utilization 
(attendance) and untreated caries among 3 -6 year old 
Medicaidenrolled  children attending well -child visits (WCV) in 
primary care settings. The focus is on addressing factors 
(determinants) at the socio -ecological levels of the child’s 
environment: provider  
(pediatrician and nurse practitioner), practice/organization level,  and 
parent/caregiver level. Eighteen practices will be randomized to 2 
arms: A) bundled multi -level intervention consisting of: 1. training 
medical providers in the Common -Sense Model of Self -Regulation 
theory -based education so that the provider delivers  to the 
parent/caregiver the following: i) Core oral health facts about dental 
caries, and ii) prescription to visit the dentist and a list of dentists 
accepting Medicaid; 2. Integration of oral health assessments into 
EMR for the provider to document in t he child’s medical record;  
versus  B) Control arm of medical providers receiving the American 
Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) based oral health education and 
providing usual AAP -based care for oral health. Each arm will 
consist of 9 practices.  Children will b e followed for 24 months or the 
completion of 3 consecutive WCV’s to determine dental utilization 
and changes in oral health status.  
Objectives:  Primary:   
To examine the effectiveness of theory -based behavioral 
(providerlevel) and implementation (practi ce-level) bundled 
interventions versus enhanced usual care (AAP based oral health 
education) delivered by [CONTACT_189936] 3 -6 year old Medicaid -enrolled children.  
Secondary:   
1) Assess the effectiveness of interventions on secondary outcomes 
(e.g. development of new caries, changes in oral hygiene, oral 
health quality of life, frequency of sweet snacks and beverages, 
cost).  
2) Assess potential mediators and moderators to investigate  the 
pathways through which the multi -level interventions affect child 
primary and secondary outcomes.  
3) Assess the adoption, reach, fidelity, and maintenance of providers 
and practices that affect child primary and secondary outcomes.

10 Population:  Study part icipants: Pediatricians/Nurse Practitioners (n = 67) and 
child and parent/caregiver dyads (n = 1024) will be recruited from 18 
primary care practices with ≥ 20% Medicaid eligible children . 
Practices are selected from Rainbow Care Connection (RCC), a 
pediat ric Medicaid accountable care organization that is part of the 
Rainbow Research Network (Clinical and Translational Science 
Collaborative [CTSC] supported practice -based pediatric research 
network), University Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_137622]. The 
recrui ted practices have 60 pediatricians and 7 nurse practitioners 
who are 73% female and 27% male. We expect child and 
parent/caregiver demographics to be similar to Census and Medicaid 
data from northeast Ohio where Medicaid -enrolled children are 61% 
African American, 32% Caucasian, 5% Hispanic, and 2% other.  
Phase:  Phase III  
Number of Sites:  18 primary care practice sites  
Description of  
Intervention:  The bundled intervention will impact providers, the practice and the 
parent/caregiver. The Common -Sense Model of Self -Regulation 
(CSM) -based education and skills training for the pediatrician or 
nurse practitioner are designed to educate them regarding chronicity 
of caries and teach them how to communicate core oral health facts 
to the parent/caregiver , provide a prescription to take the child to the 
dentist together with a list of area dentists who accept Medicaid, and 
document oral health in the EMR.  The parent/caregiver will receive 
the CSM -based facts from the providers and should take their child 
to the  dentist and improve oral health behaviors in the home. The 
practice level intervention will be enhancements to the EMR system 
to include oral health status for quality improvement of records and 
to use for follow -up with the parent/caregiver at subsequent  wellchild 
visits.

12 2 INTRODUCTION:  BACKGROUND  INFORMATION  AND  SCIENTIFIC  RATIONALE   
2.1 Background Information  
Dental caries (tooth decay) is the leading chronic childhood disease (HHS, 2000). Its prevalence 
in the primary dentition among 2 -8 year old children increased from 35% (1988 -1994) to 37% 
(2011 - 2012) and failed to meet Healthy People objectives (Dye et al., 2009). Although caries 
experience and untreated caries among [ADDRESS_225047] a higher burden of disease compared to their affluent 
counterparts (Dye et al ., 2017). In Cleveland, our community -wide study indicated an untreated 
primary caries rate of 42% (Nelson et al., 2012), much higher than the national average of 14% 
(Dye et al., 2015). Medicaid claims data from 2007 and 2008 indicates that median dental 
utilization among Medicaid -enrolled children was only 33 -37% (Hakim et al., 2012; United 
States General Accounting Office, 2008). Recent self -reported surveys indicate that 50.6% of 
Medicaid -enrolled children compared to 69.0% of non -Medicaid enrolled chil dren visited the 
dentist in the last six months (Yarbrough et al., 2014). For 13% of Medicaid -enrolled young 
children, their first dental visit was for emergency care (Divaris et al., 2014). There is clearly a 
dental care gap among 3 -5 year -old Medicaid -enrolled children with 39% having had a dental 
visit (Hakim et al., 2012), despi[INVESTIGATOR_189905] 1 (AAPD, 2014), while 67% (3 -6 year olds) received a well -child visit (USPHS, 2015).  
Due to the disparate burden of caries among young children (Dye et al., 2010), primary care 
pediatric settings have been recommended to provide preventive oral care including referral to a 
dentist. But, a recent systematic review by [CONTACT_941] U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USP STF) 
to update its recommendation for medical primary care clinicians concluded that there is lack of 
evidence on effectiveness of parent/caregiver educational interventions and primary care 
referral to dentists (Chou et al., 2014).  
The few retrospective cohort studies that have examined the effectiveness of non -dental primary 
care providers delivering preventive oral health services (POHS: such as screening exams, 
dentist referral, fluoride varnish) to young Medicaid -enrolled children have resulted in low er 
decayed missing filled teeth (dmft) in kindergarteners who received POHS compared to those 
who did not (Kranz et al., 2015). The number of dmft at age 5 was similar regardless of the type 
of provider (primary care vs. dentist) delivering POHS (Kranz, Ro zier et al., 2014). Distance 
from physician -based POHS did not impact the likelihood of the child having a medical visit, 
while distance from a dental practice lowered dental utilization (Kranz, Lee et al., 2014).  
One  recent study found that caries -related expenditures (using Medicaid claims data from 
Alabama) among children <6 years were significantly higher for those receiving dentistdelivered 
early preventive care versus those not receiving early care, while there was no difference 
between receiving ea rly preventive care from a primary care provider versus not (Blackburn et 
al., 2017). But, Milgrom and Cunha -Cruz (2017) in a letter to the editor regarding Blackburn et 
al.’s study, point out that there are several methodological limitations and that the efficacy of 
fluoride varnish is dependent on being delivered according to a periodic schedule that can be 
affected by [CONTACT_189937] -child visits which may have impacted their study conclusions. Thus, our 
proposed randomized clinical trial has the potential t o address the limitations of prior 
retrospective studies in terms of testing behavioral interventions in pragmatic settings with

13 careful control for confounders and longitudinal follow -up of children with clinical and claims 
data. The interventions being t ested also offer the opportunity to lower untreated decay and 
increase dental utilization in 3 -6 year -old Medicaid -enrolled children, two outcomes which were 
not able to be achieved in prior retrospective studies (Kranz, Rozier, et al., 2014; Kranz, Lee, e t 
al., 2014; Kranz et al., 2015). Additionally, in dental settings the effectiveness of interventions 
with oral health (OH) education or motivational interviewing have been inconclusive and these 
interventions have had limited success in eliminating or red ucing caries disparities in young 
children (Beauchamp et al., 2008; Casamassimo et al., 2014; Griffin et al., 2008; Kay & Locker, 
1996; Lee & Divaris, 2014; P. Milgrom et al., 2009; Sgan -Cohen et al., 2013).  
The literature is clear that most low -income par ent/caregivers see dental diseases as acute to 
be responded to only when there is pain or visible decay (Hooley et al., 2012). One approach 
shown to be useful in changing this reasoning process and for self -management of chronic 
medical conditions is the C ommon -Sense Model of Self -Regulation (CSM) (Leventhal et al., 
1997; Leventhal et al., 2003). The CSM is a psychological approach where individuals create a 
mental representation (or perception) of their illness based on the abstract and concrete 
sources of  information available to them. Six key domains guide the cognitive illness 
representation: identity, cause, consequence, timeline, cure or controllability, and illness 
coherence. The CSM being a “parallel -processing” model requires an emotional domain sin ce 
individuals use past illness experience, cognitive, and emotional representation to self -manage 
their illness (Moss -Morris et al., 2002). In this manner the CSM is unique from other social 
cognitive and health behavior theories (Edgar & Skinner, 2003). A negative or positive illness 
perception is formed from three sources of information (Hagger & Orbell, 2003): cultural 
knowledge of illness; information from external environment such as doctor/dentist or parent; 
and illness threat from past and current e xperiences with the disease. Based on the CSM, the 
revised illness perception questionnaire (IPQ -R) was developed (Moss -Morris et al., 2002) and 
adapted for various chronic illnesses with good reliability and validity (Abubakari et al., 2012; 
Brink et al.,  2011; Cabassa et al., 2008; Chen et al., 2008; Hurt et al., 2010; Lobban et al.,  
2005). Illness perception has been demonstrated empi[INVESTIGATOR_189906] (Covic et al., 2004; Fowler & Baas, 2006;  Giannousi et al., 
2010; Hou et al., 2010), and in development of behavioral interventions to change perception and 
improve health outcomes (Davies et al., 2008; Galli et al., 2010; Mosleh et al., 2014). Recently, 
our research team has shown that caregiver s who believed baby [CONTACT_189938] (IPQ -RD) 
that the team d eveloped and validated (Nelson et al., 2017). So, CSM -based behavioral 
interventions have the potential to modify caregiver caries perception, and improve dental 
utilization for young children.  
This multi -site, multi -level, and multi -component cluster rand omized clinical trial (RCT) will 
assess dental utilization among children following oral health interventions in the primary care 
setting. The intervention mappi[INVESTIGATOR_189907] -based multi -level 
interventions at the provider and  practice level (Bartholomew & Mullen, 2011). Drawing on 
emerging concepts from the medical literature, the common -sense model of self -regulation 
(CSM) was used as the underlying theory for the provider -level interventions. Traditionally, oral 
health educa tion has provided disjointed factual knowledge at the parent/caregiver level. In this 
Multi -Level Interventions to Reduce Caries Disparities in P rimary Care Settings                                PACT Version 9.0                               
Protocol # [ADDRESS_225048] trained in the organized CSM -based education to understand the 
chronicity of caries, and then taught to use the CSM framework to deliver key or al health facts to 
parent/caregivers with the goal of improving their cognitive and emotional representation with a 
chain of reasoning of the caries process. Other supporting theories such as the Social Cognitive 
Theory (SCT) are also used to improve the s kills and self -efficacy at the provider level to 
communicate the oral health facts (Bandura, 1991). Providers will develop skills in 5 areas: 1) 
introduce the topic of dental care in routine clinical encounters, 2) strategies to effectively 
provide brief a dvice, 3) strategies to elicit and address parent/caregiver concerns in a 
nonconfrontational manner, 4) provide a prescription for the child to go to the dentist and a list of 
area Medicaid -accepting dentists, and 5) document oral health encounter in EMR.  At a practice 
level, integration of OH documentation in EMR may be influenced by [CONTACT_189939][INVESTIGATOR_2394]/s in accordance with Roger’s diffusion of innovation theory (Greenhalgh et al., 2005; 
Rogers, 2003).  
While the focus is on addressing factors at three levels of the child’s environment (practice, 
provider, parent/caregiver, the multilevel experimental study interventions are at the provider 
(behavioral) and practice (implementation) levels. The parent/caregiver will be the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_189908]- and practice - level study interventions.  
Provider (Pediatrician or Nurse Practitioner): (1) Providers will receive theory -based 
training to  improve knowledge and skills using CSM and SCT frameworks; (2) Providers 
will communicate to parent/caregiver the CSM -based oral health facts, and provide 
prescription to go to the dentist + a list of Medicaid accepting dentists.  
Parent/caregiver: Parents/caregivers will receive from the provider, CSM -based oral 
health facts and a prescription + list of Medicaid - accepting dentists to increase the 
child’s dental attendance and improve oral health of the child, including oral hygiene 
behaviors in the home.  
Practice (Pediatric):  Practices will integrate documentation of oral health status in the 
EMR for quality impro vement and to inform the providers of the child’s oral health status 
and previous CSM -based oral health facts (maintenance of the intervention) .  
2.[ADDRESS_225049] not been effective in stimulating dental 
attendance (Nelson et al., 2012) despi[INVESTIGATOR_189909] t and coverage 
through Medicaid. Our pi[INVESTIGATOR_189910] 86 three to six year old Medicaid -enrolled 
children indicate that 36% (31 out of 86) had untreated dental caries (cavitation), much higher 
than the national average of 18% (Dye et al. 2017).  
There are three core parent (or caregiver) issues: (1) awareness of importance of caries -free 
primary teeth; (2) understanding dental caries as a chronic disease that can be present even 
without symptomatic tooth pain; (3) navigating resources for dental ca re access. Thus, an 
accurate perception of dental caries is required for parental self -management strategies to take

Protocol # 17 -082-E       4 April 2022  
15 care of their child’s oral health needs. Also important is that parent/caregivers receive consistent 
OH facts from primary care settings, w here young children are most often seen. In one study, 
two to five year old children were [ADDRESS_225050] when advised by a primary 
health care provider, but this study also reported that low -income families were less likely to be 
advised (Beil & Rozier, 2010).  
Interventions that improve dental attendance among disparate populations are likely to reduce 
caries disparities. In this study, parents/caregivers are recipi[INVESTIGATOR_189911] a 
dissemination channel from provid ers to parents/caregivers. Parents/caregivers are not the 
direct target of the intervention, but indirectly benefit through the provider. This active 
dissemination strategy builds on evidence that parents/caregivers perceive healthcare providers 
to be trus ted resources for health information (Nyhan et al. 2014). By [CONTACT_189940] -based education, interactive 
practice sessions with standardized patients, and training in EMR documentation, we 
hypothesize parents/caregivers will receive this new information along with copi[INVESTIGATOR_189912] (e.g., prescription to the dentist, list of Medicaid accepting dental providers) from the 
child’s provider. As a result, we hypothesize that providers wit h improved knowledge regarding 
the chronicity of caries and appropriate skills training will deliver consistent reinforcing oral 
health facts to parents (at annual WCVs) that will result in increased dental utilization for their 
child compared to those pro viders delivering usual care based on AAP education.  
There are three pathways to dissemination of evidence -based interventions: The first pathway 
which is the most common is the “direct to practice” through the development of an exportable 
package or tool kit distributed through professional or public -health organizations; The second 
pathway involves “policy to practice” through establishment of policies to be followed by 
[CONTACT_189941]; The third pathway is systematic “diffusion research” to assess the 
effectiveness of different dissemination methods, and one that is least frequently used. A 
qualitative study among primary care providers indicated that health professionals require a tool 
kit that is demonstrated to be effective, easy to tailor  and apply, has a table of contents to 
navigate to the relevant content, infrastructure/organizational support, and availability of support 
from practice facilitators or other experts. Further, tool kits can be an effective knowledge 
transfer strategy. Few  theory -based tool kits exist for oral health interventions in primary care, 
therefore to address this gap we will develop a tool kit according to the first pathway utilizing the 
evidence from our cluster randomized clinical trial and the qualitative findi ngs.

confidential information can be lost but we will use every precaution to protect the information 
we collect. As a result of pa rticipating in this study, there would be additional time added to the 
well-child visit that can potentially lead to some loss of productivity for providers.

Child participants may benefit by [CONTACT_189942]/her te eth and/or from their 
parent/caregiver learning about oral health. Parents/caregivers will receive information about 
taking the child to the dentist for preventive visits.  
Providers may benefit from participating in the study by [CONTACT_189943], 
integrating an oral health protocol into practice routines, and best practices for communicating 
oral health facts to parents/caregivers. EMR Documentation of oral health will help the providers 
to follow -up with the parent at the next well -child v isit and be useful for practice quality 
improvement.   
 
3 OBJECTIVES  
3.1 Study Objectives  
Primary Objectives:  
1) To examine the effectiveness of theory -based behavioral (provider -level) and 
implementation (practice -level) bundled interventions versus enhan ced usual care 
(based on AAP oral health education) delivered by [CONTACT_189944] 3 -6 year old Medicaid -enrolled children.  
Secondary Objectives:   
1) Assess the effectiveness of interventions on secondary outcomes (e.g. d evelopment of 
new caries, changes in oral hygiene, oral health quality of life, frequency of sweet 
snacks and beverages, cost).  
2) Assess potential mediators and moderators to investigate the pathways through which 
the multi -level interventions affect child primary and secondary outcomes.  
3) Assess the adoption, reach, fidelity, and maintenance of providers and practices that 
affect child primary and secondary outcomes.

Protocol # 17 -082-E       4 April 2022  
17 3.2.1 Primary Outcome Measures  
The primary outcome will be dental attendance (receipt of dental care as yes/no, and number of 
visits). The primary outcome will be determined through a hierarchical process where Medicaid 
dental claims data (Current Dental Terminology (CDT) codes for preventive or restorative 
procedures in the past 12 months) would be the primary measure, followed by [CONTACT_189945] (restoration or extraction between WCVs #1 and #2, and 
between WCVs #2 and #3), conducted by [CONTACT_87059] (See Section 14.2).  
3.2.2 Secondary Outcome Measures  
Secondary outcomes will be assessed through clinical dental screenings for new primary and 
permanent decayed and filled teeth (dft/DFT: number of new c avitated lesions or restorations on 
teeth that were previously sound and number of new restorations on teeth that were previously 
decayed at the baseline WCV), questionnaire responses for oral hygiene (frequency of tooth 
brushing), diet (frequency of sweet  food and drinks), and oral health -related quality of life 
(ECOHIS, numeric score) (Pahel et al., 2007). The direct and indirect dental costs will be 
assessed through various sources (See Table 8.1.[ADDRESS_225053] elements and 
sources).  
3.2.3  Mediators, Moderators, Confounders, & Implementation Measures  
Mediators, moderators, confounders, and implementation measures will be assessed at the 
parent, provider and practice levels. The interventions are likely to influence mediators at the 
practice l evel (EMR documentation and practice readiness, climate, attitude) and at the provider 
level (oral health knowledge and self -efficacy). Subsequently, providers improved oral health 
knowledge and communication of oral health facts to parent is likely to inf luence parent -level 
mediators (illness perception and parent self -efficacy to take the child to the dentist). The 
moderators for the relationship between the interventions and the primary/secondary outcomes 
are parental socio -demographics, health literacy and social support and the confounders are 
child medical illness. Provider socio -demographics can also be a moderator to this relationship. 
See Sections 4 (Figure 4.2.1) for more details on mediators, moderators and confounders and 
Table 8.1.1 for implemen tation measures and for more details regarding how these measures 
will influence the primary and secondary outcomes.  
3.3 Additional Objective with Supplement  
To evaluate the process and outcomes data from the implementation of the cluster randomized 
clinic al trial, together with additional provider qualitative data on barriers/enablers (using Roger’s 
Diffusion of Innovation framework) collected during this revision for the development of a toolkit 
for dissemination to stakeholders.  
As part of the supplement , providers will complete a follow -up structured interview and 
debriefing session.

18 4 STUDY  DESIGN  
This study will utilize a multi -site, multi -level, and multi -component cluster randomized clinical 
trial design (Phase III) to assess interventions intended to address poor dental utilization 
(attendance) and untreated caries among 3 -6 year old Medicaid -enrolled children attending 
well-child visits (WCV) in primary care settings. The focus is on addressing factors  
(determinants) at the socio -ecological levels of the child’s environment: provider (pediatrician 
and nurse practitioner), parent/caregiver and p ractice/organization levels. Eighteen practices will 
be randomized to 2 arms for provider training and practice/organization level study intervention 
changes: A) provider -level CSM training, provision of oral health facts to parents, a prescription 
and a l ist of dentists accepting Medicaid + practice -level EMR changes for documenting oral 
health; B) AAP training with no prescription or list of dentists accepting Medicaid and no 
changes to the EMR. Arm A parents/caregivers will receive oral health facts and prescription to 
take their child to the dentist and improve oral health behaviors in the home, while Arm B 
parent/caregivers will receive usual AAP -based care for oral health. Each arm will consist of 9 
practices (n= 18), 33 to 34 providers (n= 67), and 51 2 parent/caregiver and child dyads (n= 
1024). Each parent/caregiver and child dyads will be recruited at the first WCV and then 
followed for two consecutive WCVs (for a [ADDRESS_225054] has completed 
3 well child visits). Each provide r will complete the didactic and skills training prior to enrolling 
any parent/caregiver and will participate in the study for a total of 24 months duration (includes 
initial and booster didactic and skills training: 3 months, WCV#1: 3 months, WCV#2: 3 mon ths, 
WCV#3: 3 months). Data will be collected prior to WCVs, at WCVs, and follow -up visits.  
Immediately after randomization of practices, recruitment will be rolled -out, i.e. parent/caregivers 
will be recruited during a 3 -month period in 6 practices at a t ime, with recruitment at all 18 
practices expected to be completed in 9 months. This strategy will maximize staff time and 
ensure that EMR integration of OH is complete at practices randomized to Arm A, and that 
providers receive the didactic and skills tr aining prior to their practice’s rollout.  
4.1 Study participants  
Subjects will be pediatric providers (Pediatricians/Nurse Practitioners) and parent/caregivers 
and their 3 -6 year old children from 18 primary care practices located in Ashtabula, Cuyahoga, 
Geauga, Lorain, Medina, and Portage counties in Ohio (see Table 4.1.1 below). One additional 
practice not included in the table, Premier Pediatrics, has also agreed to participate and will be 
included if needed to replace a practice.  The majority of the p ractices are in Cuyahoga County 
(67%) and the remaining 33% are in surrounding counties in NE Ohio. All practices serve ≥ 20% 
Medicaid eligible children (9 practices with 20 -40% and 9 practices with > 40% Medicaid -eligible 
children) and are from the Rainbo w Care Connection (RCC). The study is offered to all 
pediatricians/nurse practitioners in the recruited practices and will be offered to all eligible 
caregivers and their children excluding those with serious medical or behavioral conditions 
which would pr eclude them from participating in the dental screening. All provider and parent 
participants meeting the eligibility criteria will be enrolled in the study upon signing the consent 
form.

Practice information data captured 1/1/2016 through 12/31/2016.  
**Data captured 1/1/2017 through 5/31/[ADDRESS_225056] through which the behavioral (provider -level) and 
implementation (practice -level) interventions are intended to result in improved receipt of dental 
care. The theory -driven interventions were developed using two frameworks: socio -ecological 
(McLeroy et al., 1988; Sallis and Owen, 2002) and intervention ma ppi[INVESTIGATOR_007] (Bartholomew & 
Mullen, 2011). Thus, on a provider -level, pediatricians’ and nurse practitioners’ communication 
of OH facts + prescription along with list of dentists are intended to change parental caries 
illness perception (from disjointed inaccurat e → chronic organized understanding) and are 
intended to change self -efficacy to seek dental care for their child. On a practice level, the 
integration of oral health and systematic documentation in EMR supports uniform data collection 
and enhances continu ous quality improvement to facilitate providers’ follow -up with the parent at 
the next WCV.  
Study measures/evaluations  (See Table 8.1.1) will utilize the RE -AIM framework (Glasgow et 
al., 2001; Glasgow et al., 1999) similar to a hybrid designed study (Cully et al., 2014). Internal 
validity is assessed by [CONTACT_189946]/fidelity; external validity is asse ssed by 
[INVESTIGATOR_104189] -Level Interventions to Reduce Caries Disparities in P rimary Care Settings                                PACT Version 9.0

20 reach, adoption, and maintenance (See Figure 4.2.1). Child primary (i.e. dental attendance) and  
secondary  (i.e. development of new caries, changes in oral hygiene, frequency of sweetened 
food and drinks, oral health -related quality of life, and den tal costs) effectiveness outcomes  will 
be mediated by [CONTACT_189947]’s illness perception and self -efficacy. Other external validity 
outcomes as a result of provider - and practice -level interventions via mediators (provider’s OH 
knowledge and self -efficacy; practice’s leadership completing the organization readiness, 
climate, and attitude questionnaire) will also influence the child outcomes. A literature search on 
the predictors of dental attendance identified moderating variables such as caregivers’ 
sociodemographics (Ismail et al. 2003), health literacy (Vann et al., 2013), social support 
(Duijster et al., 2014;Nelson et al., 2012) and child medical illness as a confounder (Chi et al., 
2011; Chi & Raklios, 2012). Thus, all measures and evaluations coll ected for this study will 
follow the conceptual model.  
For the purposes of dissemination of cRCT study results and the intervention components to all 
stakeholders, the study will utilize Roger’s Diffusion of Innovation3 framework for evaluation and 
develop ment of a toolkit. Specifically, process outcomes collected as part of implementing the 
cRCT together with additional structured interview data (to be collected from participating 
providers) on barriers/enablers will help in understanding the characteristi cs of the intervention 
and any changes that would need to be made for dissemination purposes.

Interventions  to be tested:  
Arm A (N = 512):  Practices will receive interventions at the provider and practice levels.  
Provider -level interventions will be : Common -Sense Model of Self -Regulation (CSM) based 
education and skills training for the provider to teach him/ her to communicate core oral health 
facts to parents, provide a prescription to take their child to the dentist together with a list of 
Medicaid -accepting dentists in the area, and document the oral health encounter in EMR.  
Practice -level interventions wi ll be: Enhancements to the EMR system to include oral health 
documentation (four questions) which will be implemented prior to enrolling any parent/caregiver 
and child participants into the study.  
Arm B (N = 512):  Enhanced usual care (AAP based) at the pr ovider level, no practice level 
intervention.   
Providers in these practices will receive American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) based oral 
health education and follow the usual care for oral health assessment recommended by [CONTACT_189948]. The AAP based edu cation is unlike the CSM based intervention education (given to 
Arm A) in that it is not theory based to provide understanding of the chronicity of dental caries.

Protocol # [ADDRESS_225058] structured 
interview data from participating providers on implementation barriers/enablers to evaluate best 
strategies for dissemination of the oral health intervention. In addition to disseminating trial 
results, a tool kit will also be developed to translate the evidence based interve ntion among all 
primary care stakeholders.  
The 63 participating providers will be asked to participate in a structured interview to assess the 
characteristics of the intervention and implementation barriers/enablers according to Roger’s 
Diffusion of Innovation framework. These interviews will be co llected from the providers after the 
completion of all parent/caregiver -child dyad WCV3 visits. A trained moderator will conduct the 
interviews (≈45 minutes) at the practices to assess the following: 1) relative advantage of the 
OH intervention; 2) compati bility of the OH intervention with the needs of the adopters; 3) 
Complexity of the OH intervention; 4) Trialability, i.e. implementing the OH intervention without a 
large investment; 5) observability, i.e if the results of the OH intervention are noticeabl e to 
parents and providers. The table below gives the list of questions that will be asked under each 
domain. All interviews will be audio -taped. Audio tapes from the interviews will be transcribed, 
and then coded in Atlas.ti, a software program which allo ws for the analysis of qualitative data. 
Analysis will be supervised by [CONTACT_6283]. Nelson who has experience conducting qualitative work. A 
detailed summary of the ideas for implementation strategies and development of the tool kit will 
be produced. Interviews w ith providers will be conducted using zoom if in -person interviews are 
not possible due to the current COVID -19 outbreak.  
 
Diffusion of Innovations Theory Characteristics  Structured interview Questions for Providers  
(1) Relative advantage; the degree to which 
the Innovation is viewed as better than the 
previously available ideas or programs.  Is the information in the didactic oral health (OH) 
curriculum you received as part of training better 
than the ones available on professional websites 
(ADA, AAP, and  AAPD)?  
a. Was anything new presented?  
b. Did you learn anything?  
Can the curriculum with the OH facts be delivered 
successfully to parents? Should the training be 
made available from experts?  
a. Has skills training been helpful?  
b. Does it give confidence in delivery?  
c. Is in-person training necessary?  
(2) Compatibility: the degree to which the 
innovation is consistent with the values, 
experiences, and needs of potential 
adopters.  Are the OH activities in primary care compatible 
with physicians/NP’s goal of qua lity of care 
delivery?  
a. What are the enablers?  
b. What are the barriers?

23 (3) Complexity: How difficult the innovation is 
to understand or how complex it is to use.  Are the OH activities simple to be followed in 
practice settings?  
a. What could be made simpler?  
b. What works and what does not?  
(4) Trialability: the degree to which the 
innovation can be experimented with on a 
limited basis without a large investment.  Has the implementation of OH activities been 
cost-effective?  
(5) Observability: the degree to which  the 
results of an innovation are visible to 
others.  Do you think the OH activities have helped your 
parents to take their child to the dentist and also 
helped with Quality Improvement in your practice?

24 During the pi[INVESTIGATOR_189914], Medical Directors from the 26 RCC practices were invited to 
participate in an informational webinar led by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_1238] a Co -Investigator (Medical Director of 
the RCC) to learn more about the opportunity for th eir practice to participate in the study. The 
PI, Project Manager and Study Coordinator then met with interested providers at practices 
which met the inclusion criteria. The [ADDRESS_225061] between the study staff and 
practice staff to ensure any iss ues which may arise are addressed immediately, and tailoring 
study logistics based on practice flow as learned from our two pi[INVESTIGATOR_189915].  
Practices also receive compensation for facility use for the trainings, for research staff being 
present at the pra ctices to complete study visits, and for the structured interviews and debriefing 
sessions.  
Providers:  
During the pi[INVESTIGATOR_189914], all pediatricians and nurse practitioners of the [ADDRESS_225062] Manager and Study Coordinator briefed the providers regarding the study goals and 
logistics. A total of 67 providers from the 18 practices to be randomized who met the inclusion 
criteria will participat e in the main trial. An additional information session for providers will be 
held at each practice prior to the start of the main trial. At this time, informed consent will be 
obtained from each pediatrician/nurse practitioner participant.  
Retention strat egies  for providers include Continuing Medical Education (CME) credits for 
didactic OH education and Maintenance of Certification (MOC) credits for quality improvement 
initiatives. Twenty five (25) MOC credits have been approved by [CONTACT_189950] (AAP) for physicians participating in this dental project. The study staff will maintain 
regular contact [CONTACT_189951].   
CME credits will also be available for providers upon completion of briefin g seminar.     
Parent/caregivers:  
All parents of [ADDRESS_225063] a WCV at 
the pediatric offices per year.  In our pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], the participation rate was 95%, hence similar 
strategies will be implemented in the main trial.  
A team consisting of a research assista nt and dental hygienist will be assigned to one practice 
at a time to be on -site daily for recruitment of caregiver -child dyads at larger practices. A floating 
team will recruit at multiple smaller practices simultaneously. The available sample pool for th e 
3-month recruitment period is 1,855 (25% of 7,421). We anticipate that 5% will be ineligible 
based on inclusion and exclusion criteria, thus reducing the potential sample to 1,762 (95% of 
1,855). Based on our experiences recruiting and enrolling parent/c aregivers in [ADDRESS_225064] Version 9.0                               
Protocol # [ADDRESS_225065] a participation rate of 95% (of 1,762), giving us an available potential sample size of 
1,[ADDRESS_225066] a potential sample 
size of 5,022 from whom we can  recruit the target sample size of 1024 participants (512 per arm 
for 2 arms) required to test the hypothesis of the study. Therefore, our goal of recruiting 56 to 57 
participants per practice given the potentially large population pool of each practice is  an 
achievable approach to meet the main trial sample size. The recruitment is expected to be 
completed within a 9 -month time frame.  
The recruitment and enrollment strategies proved to be effective in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_189916]: 
● When making appointment reminder calls, practice staff will give a brief overview of the 
study (using a recruitment script) and ask caregivers to come early to fill out the consent 
forms and questionnaires.  
● Tailored to the practice’s or provider’s preference, the medical assistant may approach 
caregivers first, before study staff explain and obtain consent. An alternative approach is 
that study staff will approach caregivers in the waiting room.  
● All 3 questionnaires, i.e. Illness Perception Question naire -Revised for Dental (IPQ -RD), 
Parent Questionnaire, and Parent Exit Questionnaire, can be completed on paper or 
tablet according to the caregiver’s preference.  
● At each WCV, study staff will give caregivers an incentive (i.e. cash or gift card) and a 
small gift for their child for completing the study visit questionnaires.  
Retention strategies  for parent/caregivers, lessons learned from the pi[INVESTIGATOR_189917]:  
● Parents/caregivers will be given promotional items (i.e. pens, magnets) with the study 
logo and contact [CONTACT_87065].  
● Alternate contact [CONTACT_87066]/friends that may be able to reach the participant if 
primary contact [CONTACT_189952].  
● Annual birthday/holiday cards will be sent to parent and child participants to maintain 
contact.  
● Newsletters will be sent twice a year with updates on the study’s progress (i.e.  
recruitment), and a reminder to update their contact [CONTACT_189953] (by [CONTACT_87068]).  
● Study staff will contact [CONTACT_3654]/caregivers during follow -up to remind them to schedule 
and attend their annual WCV.  
● Assistance from practice staff will also be solicited for hard to reach/contact [CONTACT_4317].  
5.4 Treatment As signment Procedures  
5.4.1 Randomization Procedures  
Eighteen practices (comprising the clusters) will be included in the study. Practices will be 
randomized to one of the two arms using a restricted randomization scheme with the constraint 
that 9 practices  will be assigned to each arm. This approach will involve the computation of a 
balance score (for each candidate randomization) based on marginal differences in three key 
Multi -Level Interventions to Reduce Caries Disparities in P rimary Care Settings                                PACT Version 9.0                               
Protocol # 17 -082-E       4 April 2022  
26 practice -level variables: % Medicaid -enrolled patients [20% to 40% and >40%], ratio o f patients 
to providers, county [Cuyahoga vs. other]). We use the first generated (constrained) 
randomization that provides good balance according to a pre -selected balance criterion; it may 
be reasonable to require perfect marginal balance, if (as we expe ct) there are a reasonably 
large number of randomizations that yield this.   
5.4.2 Masking Procedures  
Parent/caregiver participants will be blinded to the intervention arms of the main trial. 
Furthermore, parent/caregiver participants will not be aware of what is involved in the study 
procedures being followed at other clinics. Study staff conducting denta l screenings will also be 
blinded.

outlined in the consent form documents.  
Participants who drop out (or w ithdraw) from the study by [CONTACT_87070]/withdrawals.  Participants who are discontinued from the study by [CONTACT_87071] a dropout/withdrawal.   
An investigator may terminate a study su bject’s participation in the study if:  
● Any medical condition or situation occurs such that continued participation in the study 
would not be in the best interest of the participant.  
● The subject meets an exclusion criterion (either newly developed or not pr eviously 
recognized) that precludes further study participation.  
5.5.[ADDRESS_225068] Discontinuation of Study 
Intervention  
All reasons for dropout/withdrawal or discontinuation of the study intervention will be 
documented in th e tracking database and reviewed by [CONTACT_189954].  For gathering information on discontinuation, study staff 
will be contact[CONTACT_189955]. Study staff will contact [CONTACT_7078]/caregivers  
within 2 weeks of WCVs #1 and #[ADDRESS_225069] B1 questionnaires not previously returned, 6 
months after WCVs #1 and #2 to complete B2 questionnaires, and 3 months and 2 weeks 
before WCVs #2 and #3 to remind caregivers to schedule/attend WCV.  
In the event of  a subject telling study staff that he/she is droppi[INVESTIGATOR_87020], the study 
staff should gather the following information as much as the participant allows.

Refer to Appendix B  for more details on section 6 in the Fidelity Monitoring Plan.  
6.1 Study Behavioral or Social Intervention(s) Description  
Complete descriptions of the interventions are given in the fidelity monitoring plan (Appendix B).  
The interventions for this study are on two levels as follows: Provider:  Common -Sense Model of 
Self-Regulation (CSM) based education and skills training for the pediatrician/nurse practitioner 
to understand chroni city of caries, and communicate the core OH facts to the parent, provide a 
prescription to take the child to the dentist together with a list of area dentists accepting  
Medicaid, and document OH in EMR. Practice:  enhancements to the EMR system to include OH 
status will be implemented prior to enrolling any parent into the study. This will promote 
adoption of systematic EMR documentation of OH status that can facilitate follow -up with parent 
at subsequent WCVs.

6.2 Administration of Intervention  
Arm A  
The provider -level intervention  consists of CSM theory based didactic education and skills 
training for providers to learn about the chro nicity of caries, to communicate core oral health 
facts to parent/caregivers at the well -child visit (WCV), to provide a prescription to take their 
child to the dentist together with a list of area Medicaid -accepting dentists, and to document OH 
in EMR. By  [CONTACT_189958], interactive practice sessions with standardized patients, and training in 
Multi -Level Interventions to Reduce Caries Disparities in P rimary Care Settings                                PACT Version 9.0                               
Protocol # 17 -082-E       4 April 2022  
30 EMR documentation, parents/caregivers will receive the core OH facts along with copi [INVESTIGATOR_189918] (e.g., prescription to dentist, list of Medicaid accepting dental providers) from the 
child’s provider. Providers will receive didactic education with pre - and post -tests and interactive 
skills training with standardized patients (SP s). Providers will also be given materials (Appendix 
D) to help them implement the intervention including: training manual that includes a didactic 
section on oral health and skills section on communication (more specifics on the training 
manual will be de tailed in the MOP), pocket card (with core oral health facts listed), and flip 
chart (to use during oral health communication to caregivers). The training will be delivered to 
providers in two 45 -minute sessions (didactic education first and then skills tr aining) at their 
individual practice prior to study enrollment of caregiver and child participants at WCV #1. There 
will be a booster education session before WCV #2. The final WCV #[ADDRESS_225070] practice -level intervention  that includes incorporation of four oral health 
questions into the practice EMR. As a result of this practice -level intervention, Arm A providers 
will receive EMR training to document the oral health encounter. The EMR training will occur 
simultaneously with the didactic and skills training sessions prior to WCV #1 and the booster 
session before WCV #2. Providers will receive an EMR training manual for documentation 
(more specifics on the EMR training manual will be detailed in the MOP; see A ppendix D for 
EMR screenshots). While the majority of University Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_189919], the OH questions are hidden and will be available only to 
providers with appropriate training in practices in s tudy Arm A. The other non -UH based 
practices randomized to study Arm A will have the OH questions incorporated prior to 
enrollment of caregiver and child participants.  
Parents/caregivers of the providers and practices in Arm A are the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_189920]. Parent/caregivers will receive CSM -based oral health facts, 
prescription to go to the dentist together with a list of Medicaid -accepting dentist.  
Arm B  
Providers will receive the standard AAP based didactic educatio n in a 45 -minute session prior to 
WCV #1and a booster session prior to WCV #2. Arm B providers will not receive any 
CSMbased education, skills training or the practice -level intervention.  
Parents/caregivers in this arm will receive the usual care for oral health as followed by [CONTACT_189959].

Protocol # 17 -082-E       4 April 2022  
31 6.3.1 Procedures for Training Interventionists  
Provider training (Arm A) will be conducted by [CONTACT_189960]: Drs. Nelson (who  
has more than 20 years of experience as an oral health researcher), Ferretti (who has spent 
more than 20 years teaching residents as chief of pediatric dentistry), and Lord (a 
communication specialist with more than 10 years of teaching experience in the area of primary 
care delivery). The provider will need to complete three components satisfactorily to be 
considered as trained: (1) didactic training (assessed through pre and post test); (2) skills 
training (assessed through standardized communication che cklist, and self -efficacy pre and post 
test); (3) observation of the first OH encounter of the provider by [CONTACT_464] (assessed through 
the standardized communication checklist. A score card will be given that outlines the 
established target goals which a re elaborated in detail in the Fidelity Monitoring Plan in 
Appendix B).  
Training materials, including scripts and narrated slides, will ensure that the curricula are 
delivered in the same way for each group of clinicians to ensure fidelity of the training  delivery. 
A training manual (for Arm A) more specifics will be detailed in the MOP), EMR training (only 
Arm A) and flip chart and pocket card (Arm A) have been developed to provide information as 
needed (Appendix D, also includes EMR screen shot). Additio nal booster training for providers 
will be conducted, if necessary, to address deviations in protocol.  
6.3.2 Procedures for Monitoring Intervention Fidelity  
Arm A  
Providers’ implementation of the provider -level intervention  will be assessed at all 3 WCVs.  
Two - three of each provider’s OH encounters with parent/caregiver will be observed or 
audiotaped and then evaluated by [CONTACT_189961] a standardized communication skills 
checklist (Appendix E) at WCV #1 and WCV#2. The results of the observation/a udiotapi[INVESTIGATOR_189921] a scorecard to provide feedback regarding whether the provider met 
the established target goals which are elaborated in detail in the Fidelity Monitoring Plan 
(Appendix B). All enrolled caregivers will complete a n exit questionnaire (Appendix E) after the 
OH encounter to assess whether the provider communicated the OH facts and gave them the 
prescription and list of dentists. So, Provider -level fidelity measures  to assess whether providers 
communicated the core OH  facts to caregivers and delivered the prescription to go to the dentist 
and list of area Medicaid -accepting dentists include: 1) standardized communication skills 
checklist completed by [CONTACT_85602] 2) parent exit questionnaire (Appendix E).  
Providers’  implementation of the practice -level intervention  will be assessed at all 3 WCVs. 
Study staff will complete monthly EMR audits (at all 3 WCVs) of all enrolled patients’ EMR chart 
to assess whether providers’ OH documentation was complete.  
The practice -level fidelity measure  to assess adoption of the intervention is the EMR Audit of 
Practice form completed by [CONTACT_464] (Appendix E).  
Arm B

Protocol # 17 -082-E       4 April 2022  
32 Since Arm B does not receive the interventions, monitoring procedures outlined below will be 
used to monitor baselin e rate and check for contaminations between study arms.  
Two - three of each provider’s OH encounters will be randomly selected for 
observation/audiotapi[INVESTIGATOR_189922] A. Scorecards will not be given to Arm B providers, 
but evaluation with the checklist will serve to document the communication of OH facts due to 
enhanced usual care.  
Study staff will complete monthly EMR audits using the EMR Audits of Practice form (at al l 3 
WCVs) for 20% of enrolled patients’ EMR chart to assess whether any oral health 
documentation was completed despi[INVESTIGATOR_189923]. (Appendix E).  
6.4 Assessment of Provider Compliance with Study Intervention  
Arm A  
Compliance with the provi der-level intervention : The study staff’s direct observation/audiotape of 
provider encounters will provide an assessment of whether providers communicated all [ADDRESS_225072] of area  
Medicaid -accepting dentists. It will also be used to assess whether the provider initiated the 
topic of the child’s dental care with the caregiver and used appropriate communication skills. 
The exit questionnaire completed by [CONTACT_7078]/caregivers will assess  whether their 
pediatrician/nurse practitioner communicated OH facts and gave them the prescription to go to 
the dentist and list of dentists (i.e. whether the caregiver received and understood the main 
points of the provider’s oral health communication an d the prescription they were being given). 
Compliance will also be verified with the numbered prescriptions and list of dentists to determine 
the total number given to each provider’s enrolled caregivers.  
Compliance with the practice -level intervention : The study staff will conduct EMR audits of all 
enrolled patients to determine whether the OH documentation was complete, i.e. provider 
documented whether or not they did the following during the OH encounter: 1) examined child’s 
teeth for white or brown spo ts, 2) asked whether child had a dental visit in the past 12 months, 
3) communicated core OH facts, and 4) gave caregiver a prescription to take their child to the 
dentist along with a list of Medicaid -accepting dentists in the area.  
Arm B  
Compliance with  the provider -level intervention : Study staff evaluation of providers’ OH 
encounters and parent exit questionnaires completed by a random 20% selection of each 
provider’s enrolled patients will be used to assess whether Arm B providers communicated OH 
facts to identify possible contamination bias in delivery of the provider -level intervention (i.e. 
provider is giving caregivers provider -level intervention materials not associated with their 
assigned arm).  
Study staff will perform EMR audits on a random 20% selection of each provider’s enrolled 
patients to identify possible contamination bias in delivery of the practice -level intervention (i.e. 
providers are documenting patients’ OH without having received the practice -level intervention).

38 ● If a parent/caregiver and child withdraws or changes to a practice not participating, visits 
and data collection will end with these participants being considered lost to follow -up. 
Data collected up to the point of withdrawal will be used for analysis.  
7.2.5 Parent/Caregiver and Child Unscheduled /Missed  Visit  
Unscheduled visits for parent/caregiver and child may occur if an enrolled child could not 
complete the oral health portion during the WCV. But, this is unlikely to happen due to the short 
amount time required for the oral health activities. Ano ther possibility would be if a child is 
scheduled by [CONTACT_189964] a well child visit much sooner or later than the visit window. In 
these cases, study data would be collected per guidelines outlined in the MOP, but the time 
length between visits will b e accounted for in the analysis stage.  
Other instances of unscheduled visits at follow -up, i.e.WCV2 or WCV3, may occur if a well child 
visit is missed by [CONTACT_60551] (for example, a child comes in for a sick visit near the time a well 
child visit is due and the provider completes the well visit also) or another non -participating 
provider at the practice is scheduled to see the child for a well child visit.  In these cases, the 
ICDAS, A2, A3 and B1 questionnaires will be completed when possible, either in person, by 
[CONTACT_155498] a link sent via text or e -mail to the parent/caregiver. The B2 follow -up will be 
completed as planned. In extreme situations, if we have missed the WCV2 or WCV3 and the 
child is scheduled to come in to see the enrolled provider f or follow -up for a problematic issue 
within [ADDRESS_225075] the parent/c aregiver bring the child to the Dental Research Building for 
completion of the ICDAS dental screening. Also, due to scheduling irregularities in the part of 
the parent/caregiver, every child may not be scheduled for an annual WCV. In cases such as 
this, th e parent/caregiver -child dyad may remain enrolled in the study and be seen for 
completion of 3 consecutive WCV’s regardless of their timing. The time length between visits 
will be accounted for in the analysis stage.  
COVID -19 Visits  
Visits missed due to t he COVID -19 pandemic will follow the protocol outlined above for 
unscheduled/missed visits.  
8 STUDY  PROCEDURES  / EVALUATIONS  
8.1 Study Procedures/Evaluations  
The following is a summary of the study procedures and evaluations.  Study procedures include 
interventions, and procedures performed to assess the primary outcome, secondary outcomes, 
mediators, moderators and confounders. Measures or interventions will occur at the 
socioecological levels of child, parent/caregiver, provider, and practice. There will  also be 
implementation evaluation at each of these levels except the parent/caregiver. See Table 8.1.1 
for more details on the measures, sources, and timeline. According to the timeline of study 
procedures and evaluations, WCV #1: Baseline Visit = T 0; WCV  #2: Follow -up Visit = T 3; and 
WCV #3: Final Study Visit = T 6.

Protocol # 17 -082-E       4 April 2022  
40 8.1.1 Child -level  
The primary (i.e. dental attendance) and  secondary outcomes (i.e. new decay, oral hygiene, 
frequency of sweet food and drinks, oral health -related quality of life, and dental -related costs) 
are also implementation measures of effectiveness. Child medical illness is a confounder.  
Child dental att endance (i.e. receipt of dental care) will be assessed through:  
● Clinical dental screenings  will be performed at all 3 WCVs (T 0, T3, and  T6) by a trained and 
calibrated dental hygienist according to the International Caries Detection and Assessment 
System ( ICDAS). The screenings will be used to identify a change in oral health status  
between WCVs #1 and #2 (T 0 and  T3) and WCVs #2 and #3 (T 3 and  T6) which is defined as a 
restoration (ICDAS ≥ 3) or extraction of ≥ 1 tooth previously identified with an active I CDAS 
lesion code ≥ 3 at T 0 or T 3 that would not be exfoliated naturally based on child’s age.  See 
ICDAS Assessment form (Appendix E). More details on the screening and decision 
algorithm will be outlined in the MOP Section 5.  
● B2: Dental Attendance & Cost Questionnaire : Study staff will contact [CONTACT_50633] 6 months 
after WCVs #1 and #2 (T 1 and  T4) to ask whether their child had a dental visit or if they made 
a dental appointment for their child since the previous WCV (Appendix E).  
● Medicaid claims files : Dat a will be abstracted by [CONTACT_189965]’s receipt of dental 
care after each WCV (T 1, T4, and T 7) and entered on the Medicaid Claims Abstraction form. 
Current Dental Terminology (CDT) codes used for billing will be used to determine if the 
child received preventive or restorative procedures in the past 12 months. Dental 
emergency department (ED) visits will be identified by [CONTACT_189966] (Appendix E) 
to ED claims using the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinic al 
Modification (ICD -10-CM). See Medicaid Claims Abstraction form (Appendix E) for 
preventive and restorative CDT codes and ICD -10-CM codes.  
● COVID -19 Questionnaire : At WCV3, actively enrolled parent/caregivers will complete a short 
(7 item) COVID -[ADDRESS_225077] due to the COVID -19 pandemic.  
Secondary outcomes and child medical illness (i.e. confounder) will be assessed as 
follows:  
● A newly carious tooth is defined as any tooth receiving an ICDAS lesion code ≥ 3 that 
received a sound code on the previous dental screening or any tooth surface with an ICDAS 
filling code ≥ [ADDRESS_225078] one. Number of teeth with new decay or filling 
will be assessed thr ough the clinical dental screenings (T 0, T3, and  T6) and recorded on the 
ICDAS Assessment form (Appendix E).  
● Questions on frequency of tooth brushing  (NHANES III)(CDC), f requency of consumption of  
sweet food and drinks  (NHANES 2009 -2010; Youth Risk Behavio r Survey 2017)(CDC,  
2017; CDC, 2014), and the [ADDRESS_225079] Scale   
(ECOHIS)(Pahel et al., 2007) will be used to measure oral hygiene, frequency of sweet food 
and drinks, and oral health -related quality of life (OHRQoL), respec tively. Higher scores on 
Multi -Level Interventions to Reduce Caries Disparities in P rimary Care Settings                                PACT Version 9.0                               
Protocol # 17 -082-E       4 April 2022  
41 the ECOHIS indicate poorer OHRQoL. These questions are included on the A2: Parent 
Questionnaire (Appendix E) which will be completed at all 3 WCVs (T 0, T3, and  T6). 
● Direct dental costs  include costs of preventive and restorative pr ocedures, and dentalrelated 
ED visits. These costs will be abstracted from Medicaid claims files as part of the verification 
of child’s dental care receipt (described above) and recorded on the Medicaid  
Claims Abstraction form. Non-dental direct costs  (transportation) and dental indirect costs  
(time away from work, household, or leisure activities) are measured using questions 
adapted from the Annotated Cost Questionnaire (Thompson & Wordsworth, 2001) which are 
incorporated into the B2 Follow -up Questionna ire. The B2 Questionnaire will be 
administered after WCVs #1 and #2 (T 1 and T 4). Study staff will administer the cost 
questionnaire at WCV #3 (T 6) to identify any lags in receipt of dental care.  Cost data from 
Medicaid claims files will be abstracted at 3  time points (T 1, T4, and  T7). See the Annotated 
Cost Questionnaire and Medicaid Claims Abstraction form (Appendix E) for more details.

classified into a 10 clinical risk gro upi[INVESTIGATOR_16816] (Chi & Raklios, 2012). EMR abstraction will 
be performed by [CONTACT_189967] (T 0, T3, and  T6). See EMR Abstraction form

Multi -Level Interventions to Reduce Caries Disparities in P rimary Care Settings                                PACT Version 9.0                               
Protocol # 17 -082-E       4 April 2022  
42 8.1.2 Parent/caregiver  
Measures at the parent/caregiver -level are mediators (IPQ -RD and self -efficacy) and 
moderators (socio -demographic characteristics, health literacy, and social support).  
● The Illness Perception Questionnaire -Revised for Dental  (IPQ-RD) (Nelson et al., 2016) is 
comprised of 5 main cognitive constructs (i.e. identity, cause, timeli ne, consequences, and 
cure/controllability) and will be used to assess the impact of the provider -level intervention 
on caregivers’ perception of their child’s dental caries. Overall and construct -specific scores 
will be calculated with higher scores indic ating caregivers’ less accurate/inaccurate 
perception of the caries disease process and its chronicity. Caregivers will complete the A1: 
IPQ-RD before the OH encounter with their provider at WCVs #1 - #3 (T 0, T3, and  T6). The 
B1: Follow -up IPQ -RD will be c ompleted after WCVs #1 and #2 (T 1 and T 4). See A1: IPQ -RD 
and B1: Follow -up IPQ -RD in Appendix E.  
● Self-efficacy (Detroit Dental Health Project, 2004)  will include [ADDRESS_225081] despi[INVESTIGATOR_189924]. Questions on self -efficacy are included in the A2: Parent Questionnaire (Appendix 
E) completed at all 3 WCVs (T 0, T3, and  T6). 
● Moderators  include: caregiver health literacy (Morris et al., 2006), social support (Zimet  et 
al., 1988), and socio -demographics (CDC), i.e. sex, age, race, education, occupation, and 
marital status. The A2: Parent Questionnaire (Appendix E) includes questions to collect data 
on all 3 moderators at all 3 WCVs (T 0, T3, and  T6). 
8.1.3 Provider  
Provider -level measures include mediators (OH knowledge and self -efficacy), a confounder 
(socio -demographic characteristics), and evaluation of implementation/fidelity (observation and 
audiotape of OH encounters) and adoption & maintenance (i.e. percentage  of enrolled patients 
given a prescription and list of dentists).  
● Providers’ OH knowledge and self -efficacy  to perform OH activities will be assessed through 
pre- and post -tests (Appendix E) administered before and after the didactic education 
session prio r to WCV #1 (T -1) and booster sessions before WCV #2 (T 2). 
● Providers’ socio -demographic characteristics  (Appendix E) will be collected at the didactic 
training sessions prior to WCV#1 (T -1).  
● As an evaluation of the implementation/fidelity of the intervent ion, providers’ oral health 
encounters will be observed or audiotaped  by [CONTACT_189968] (Appendix E), the same standardized skills 
checklist used during the skills training session (T 0, T3, and  T6).  
● Parent/caregivers will evaluate their provider’s oral health communication and delivery of 
prescription and list of dentists on the A3: Parent exit questionnaire  (Appendix E) completed 
at WCVs #1 - #3 (T 0, T3, and  T6). This is also an evaluation of imp lementation/fidelity.  
● Providers’ EMR documentation of prescriptions and lists of dentists given will be audited 
throughout the main trial (T 0, T3, and  T6), based on study arm. The percentage of enrolled  
caregivers who received the prescription and list of dentists  will be calculated as an 
Multi -Level Interventions to Reduce Caries Disparities in P rimary Care Settings                                PACT Version 9.0                               
Protocol # 17 -082-E       4 April 2022  
43 evaluation of providers’ adoption and maintenance of the provider -level intervention and 
recorded on the EMR Audit of Practice form (Appendix E).  
 Providers will complete structured interviews with a trained moderator on implementation 
barriers/enablers to evaluate best strategies for dissemination of the oral health 
intervention. The interviews will be conducted at the pediatric practices at a time convenient 
for the provider and will contain interview questions to assess  relative advantage of the OH 
intervention, compatibility of the OH intervention with the needs of the adopters, complexity 
of the OH intervention, trialability, and observability. Interviews will be conducted using 
zoom if in -person interviews are not pos sible due to the current COVID -19 outbreak.  
8.1.4 Practice  
Practice -level measures include mediators (organization readiness, organizational climate, and 
practice attitude) and evaluation of adoption and maintenance (percentage of enrolled patients 
with complete oral health documentation in EMR).  
● Mediators of organization readiness and organization climate (Stamatakis et al., 2012) and 
practice attitudes  toward adopting evidence -based interventions (EBI)(Aarons, 2004) will be 
assessed on the Practice Questionnaire (Appendix E) among leaders and providers from all 
18 practices prior to enrollment of caregiver participants (T -1). 
● Audits  of providers’ documentation of all 4 questions in EMR will be performed throughout 
the main trial (T 0, T3, and  T6), based on study arm. The percentage of enrolled patients with 
comple te documentation (i.e. all 4 questions) will be recorded on the EMR Audit of Practice 
form (Appendix E) and serve as an evaluation of the practice’s adoption and maintenance of 
systematic documentation of OH in EMR for Arm A.  
9 ASSESSMENT  OF SAFETY  
9.1 Specification of Safety Parameters  
The principal investigator (PI) will report safety events for the study (unanticipated problems 
[UPs], adverse events [AEs], serious adverse events [SAEs]) to the Institutional Review Board 
(IRB) in accordance with the IR B’s requirements as outlined below.  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_189925]. This will include UPs that meet 
the definition of a serious adverse event.  
9.1.1 Unanticipated Problems  
The Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) c onsiders unanticipated problems involving 
risks to subjects or others to include, in general, any incident, experience, or outcome that 
meets all of the following criteria:  
● unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency given (a) the research proced ures 
that are described in the protocol -related documents, such as the IRB -approved 
research protocol and informed consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the 
subject population being studied;  
Multi -Level Interventions to Reduce Caries Disparities in P rimary Care Settings                                PACT Version 9.0                               
Protocol # 17 -082-E       4 April 2022  
44 ● related or possibly related to participation in the re search (“possibly related” means there 
is a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have been 
caused by [CONTACT_3459]); and  
● suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of har m (including 
physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or 
recognized.  
9.1.[ADDRESS_225082], including any abnormal sign (f or example, abnormal physical exam or laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease, temporally associated with the subject’s participation in the 
research, whether or not considered related to the subject’s participation in the research, 
(modified from the def inition of adverse events in the 1996 International Conference on 
Harmonization E -6 Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice).  
9.1.3 Serious Adverse Events  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is one that meets one or more of the following criteria:  
● Results in death  
● Is life -threatening (places the subject at immediate risk of death from the event as it 
occurred)  
● Results in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
● Results in a persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
● Results in a congenital anomaly or birth defect   
An important medical event that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12475], based upon appropriate medical judgment, 
the event may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  
9.2 Time Period and Frequency for Event Assessment and Follow -Up 
Unanticipated problems, AE and SAEs will be recorded in the data collection system throughout 
the study. Events will be followed for outcome information until resolution or stabilization.  
Given the nature of the interventions (EMR changes, education with skills training, and 
prescription + list of dentists) it is unlikely that int ervention -related SAEs or AEs will occur. 
However, throughout the study, if a caregiver or provider reports an event to any study staff; it 
will be communicated to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_97318]. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_189926].  
9.3 Characteristics of an Adverse Event  
9.3.1 Relationship to Study Intervention  
To assess relationship of an event to study intervention, the following guidelines are used:  
Multi -Level Interventions to Reduce Caries Disparities in P rimary Care Settings                                PACT Version 9.0                               
Protocol # 17 -082-E       4 April 2022  
45 1. Related (Possibl e, Probable, Definite)  
a. The event is known to occur with the study intervention.  
b. There is a temporal relationship between the intervention and event onset.  
c. The event abates when the intervention is discontinued.  
d. The event reappears upon a re -challenge with the intervention.  
2. Not Related (Unlikely, Not Related)  
a. There is no temporal relationship between the intervention and event onset.  
b. An alternate etiology has been established.  
9.3.2 Expectedness of SAEs  
Given the nature of the interventions (EMR changes, education with skills training, and 
prescription + list of dentists) it is unlikely that intervention -related SAEs or AEs will occur.  The 
PI [INVESTIGATOR_189927]/AE expectedness, and NIDCR medical 
monitor/DSMB will then review and m ake their determination.  An adverse event will be 
considered unexpected if the nature, severity, or frequency of the event is not consistent with 
the risk information previously described for the intervention.  
9.3.3 Severity of Event  
The following scale w ill be used to grade adverse events:  
1. Mild: no intervention required; no impact on activities of daily living (ADL)  
2. Moderate: minimal, local, or non -invasive intervention indicated; moderate impact on  
ADL 
3. Severe: significant symptoms requiring invasive int ervention; subject seeks medical 
attention, needs major assistance with ADL  
9.4 Reporting Procedures  
9.4.1 Unanticipated Problem Reporting to IRB and NIDCR  
Incidents or events that meet the OHRP criteria for unanticipated problems require the creation 
and completion of an unanticipated problem report form.  The following information will be 
included when reporting an adverse event, or any other incident, experience, or outcome as an 
unanticipated problem to the IRB:  
● appropriate identifying information for the research protocol, such as the title, 
investigator’s name, and the IRB project number;  
● a detailed description of the adverse event, incident, experience, or outcome;  
● an explanation of the basis for determining that the adverse event, incident, experie nce, 
or outcome represents an unanticipated problem;

Protocol # 17 -082-E       4 April 2022  
46 ● a description of any changes to the protocol or other corrective actions that have been 
taken or are proposed in response to the unanticipated problem.   
Multi -Level Interventions to Reduce Caries Disparities in P rimary Care Settings                                PACT Version 9.0                               
Protocol # 17 -082-E       4 April 2022  
47 To satisfy the requirement for prompt reporting, unanticipated problems will be reported using 
the following timeline:   
● All unanticipated problems involving risks to subject or others must be reported to the 
UHCMC IRB within fourteen (14) calendar days of discovery of the problem or event. 
The only exce ption to the above timeframe is for the reporting of deaths. All internal, 
unexpected, study -related deaths must be reported to the IRB within seven calendar 
days of their discovery. Reporting to NIDCR and the CC must also occur within 7 
calendar days if d eath or a life -threatening event occurs or within 14 calendar days for all 
other SAEs.   
The following are examples of unanticipated problems that need to be reported by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_189928], but in all cases within 14 calendar days:  
• Adverse events, which in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_17439], are both unexpected and related or 
possible related.  
o An adverse event is “unexpected” when its specificity and severity are not 
accurately reflected in the IRB approved informed consent document.  
o An adverse event is “related to the research procedures” if in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_189929], it was more likely than not to be caused by [CONTACT_28821], or if it 
more likely than not that the event affects the rights and welfare of current 
participants.  
o All fatal e vents determined to be not study -related and expected should be kept 
in the PI’s file and do not need to be reported to the IRB.  
o All fatal events determined to be not study -related and unexpected must be 
reported to the IRB at the next continuing review or  study closure, whichever is 
first. 
• Information that indicates a change to the risks or potential benefits of the research.  
• A breach of confidentiality including inappropriate disclosure, lost or stolen confidential 
information.  
• Changes to the protocol tak en without prior IRB review to eliminate apparent immediate 
hazard to a research participant.  
• Incarceration of a participant in a protocol not approved to enroll prisoners.  
• Event that requires prompt reporting to the sponsor such as disqualification or 
suspension of investigator.  
• Complaint of a participant when the complaint indicates unexpected risks or the 
complaint cannot be resolved by [CONTACT_5051].  
Protocol deviation (including accidental or intentional protocol deviation) that caused harm to 
participants or others or indicates participants or others are at increased risk of harm.All UPs 
should be reported to appropriate institutional officials (as required by [CONTACT_17347]’s written 
reporting procedures), the supporting agency head (or designe e), and OHRP within one 
month of the IRB’s receipt of the report of the problem from the PI.  
All UPs will be reported to NIDCR’s centralized reporting system via Rho Product Safety, and to 
the CC:

50 11 CLINICAL  SITE  MONITORING  
Clinical site monitoring is conducted to ensure that the rights of human subjects are protected, 
that the study is implemented in accordance with the protocol and/or other operating 
procedures, and that the quality and integrity of study data and data collection methods are 
maintained.  Monitoring for this study will be performed by [CONTACT_100825]’s  Clinical Research 
Operations and Management Support (CROMS) contractor. The monitor will evaluate study 
processes and documentation based on NIDCR standards and the International Conference on 
Harmonisation (ICH), E6: Good Clinical Practice guidelines (GC P). 
Details of clinical site monitoring will be documented in a Clinical Monitoring Plan (CMP) 
developed by [CONTACT_100826], in collaboration with the NIDCR Office of Clinical Trials 
and Operations Management (OCTOM) and the NIDCR Program Official. Th e CMP will specify 
the frequency of monitoring, monitoring procedures, the level of clinical site monitoring activities 
(e.g., the percentage of subject data to be reviewed), and the distribution of monitoring reports.  
Some monitoring activities may be pe rformed remotely, while others will take place at the study 
site(s).  Staff from the CROMS contractor will conduct monitoring activities and provide reports 
of the findings and associated action items in accordance with the details described in the CMP.  
Documentation of monitoring activities and findings will be provided to the site study team, the 
study PIs, OCTOM, and the NIDCR. The NIDCR reserves the right to conduct independent 
audits as necessary.

Protocol # 17 -082-E       4 April 2022  
51 12 STATISTICAL  CONSIDERATIONS  
12.1 Study Hypotheses  
We hypothesize that providers with improved knowledge regarding the chronicity of caries and 
appropriate skills training (through bundled provider - and practice -level interventions) will deliver 
consistent reinforcing oral health facts to parents (at annua l WCVs) that will result in increased 
dental utilization for their child compared to those providers delivering usual care based on AAP 
education.  
12.2 Sample Size Considerations  
The study design will involve a cluster randomization to two arms:  
1. Bundle d (Practice + provider) interventions, 2. Enhanced usual care.  The assumed 
response rates (proportion of children who have dental attendance) are Arm A: 0.46 (The dental 
utilization reported among Medicaid -enrolled children by [CONTACT_189969], 2015 was 48%, 
but we used 46% to be conservative), Arm B: 0.30 (based on  pi[INVESTIGATOR_43297] 30% of parent 
reported routine dental visit for child in the past year).  
Eighteen practices (comprising the clusters) will be included in the study. Practices will be 
random ized to one of the two arms using a restricted randomization scheme with the constraint 
that 9 practices will be assigned to each arm. This approach will involve the computation of a 
balance score (for each candidate randomization) based on marginal differ ences in three key 
practice -level variables: % Medicaid -enrolled patients [20% to 40% and >40%], ratio of patients 
to providers, county [Cuyahoga vs. other]). We use the first generated (constrained) 
randomization that provides good balance according to a pre-selected balance criterion; it may 
be reasonable to require perfect marginal balance, if (as we expect) there are a reasonably 
large number of randomizations that yield this.  
The primary objective is to compare dental care attendance between the two a rms.  For 
simplicity in the power calculation we consider the binary outcome of any dental attendance in 
the two year period of follow -up. Dental attendance  will be based on a single summary score 
(number of years - out of two -  in which the child visits  the dentist at least once a year). We thus 
suppose the use of a two -sided 0.[ADDRESS_225085] (with pooled variance) for a difference in 
proportions. We assume, as a rough approximation, that the study will recruit an equal number 
of patients in each practice. Making conservative allowances for an intra -cluster (within -practice) 
correlation (ICC: in the binary dental attendance outcome) of 0.04 and a 25% drop -out rate, a 
sample size of 512 participants per arm (total n= 1024) will provide an estimated 80% power to 
detect the above difference in proportions. Alternatively, this sample size (actually 438 per 
group) will provide 90% power to detect this same effect size if the ICC is only 0.02. If the 
intervention effect is only 0.12 (0.42 versus 0.30), a sample size of 457 per group (914 total) will 
still provide 80% power with a dropout rate of 25% if the ICC is only 0.01. For the purposes of 
this study, a sample size of 512/arm (n=1024) will be recruited.  
For sample size estimates, an important secondary  outcome will be incidence of new decayed 
or filled teeth (dft). Mean dft is hypothesized to decrease for Arm A relative to Arm B. Our 
Multi -Level Interventions to Reduce Caries Disparities in P rimary Care Settings                                PACT Version 9.0                               
Protocol # 17 -082-E       4 April 2022  
52 previous data (Lee et al. 2015) among 5 to 7 year old low -income children suggests a mean dft 
for usual care of 4.5 (stan dard deviation = 7) which we assume to be a reasonable value for the 
enhanced usual care arm in the present study. We assume the same standard deviation for the 
new intervention group, assuming normally distributed responses for the power calculation. In 
fact, as dft is a count (possibly following a distribution such as Poisson or negative binomial) it is 
likely that the standard deviation will decrease with the mean, making our approach 
conservative (McCullagh and Nelder 1989).  
We suppose the use of a two -sided 0.[ADDRESS_225086] for a difference in mean dft 
between the two groups. As done for the primary outcome, we assume an equal number of 
patients in each practice and allow for 25% dropout. For dft, a robust clinical outcome, we use a 
smaller ICC of 0.02. Then for the planned recruitment sample of [ADDRESS_225087] 74% 
power to detect a 40% decrease in the mean dft (i.e., a mean dft of 2.7 in the Bundled 
intervention arm). If the ICC is only 0.1, this power will increase to 84%.  
12.3 Planned Interim Analysis  
No interim analysis is planned.  
12.4 Final Analysis Plan  
Primary Statistical Analysis:   
Descriptive statistics will include frequencies (categorical variables) and means (continuous 
variables) of baseline covariates among the three intervention groups. Chi -square tests (for 
categorical variables) and t - or F-tests (via ANOVA for continuous va riables) will be performed 
in a preliminary analysis to test for group differences.  
For the primary outcome, we will use as an overall dental attendance score the number of years 
(over the two years of follow -up) in which the child visited the dentist. This will be an ordinal 
outcome with possible scores of 0, [ADDRESS_225088], we will use a 
generalized estimating equations (GEE) approach, with practices as clusters, based on a 
proportional odds marginal model. The model covariates will include an intervention indicator 
variable (equal to 1 for bundled intervention , 0 for enhanced usual care) and a set of baseline 
variables representing potential confounders. A standard error correction (for example, the 
method by [CONTACT_189970]. 2003) will be used to adjust for a small number of clusters and 95% 
confidence intervals w ill be computed. This will be an intent -to treat analysis as all randomized 
participants providing the necessary measurements – regardless of any lack of compliance – 
will be included in the analysis.  
In the event of missing data (for either year) for den tal attendance, we will conduct sensitivity 
analyses by [CONTACT_189971] (favoring the null hypothesis) 
and re -running the analysis described above on the completed data.  
Analysis of Secondary Outcomes:  Summary statistics (including means and standard errors) for 
secondary outcomes will be calculated by [CONTACT_65237]. The same approach as above will 
be used for binary or ordinal secondary outcomes (oral hygiene, frequency of sweet snacks and 
beverages). Namely, ordinal  outcomes for each variable will be defined that summarize 
outcomes over time. For continuous outcomes (e.g., OH quality of life, cost), the above method 
Multi -Level Interventions to Reduce Caries Disparities in P rimary Care Settings                                PACT Version 9.0                               
Protocol # 17 -082-E       4 April 2022  
53 will be modified by [CONTACT_2329] a linear model (identify link) for GEE, modeling the mean response 
over time  as a summary measure. These outcomes will each be tested for normality using the 
Shapi[INVESTIGATOR_2152] -Wilk statistic; outcomes for which normality is violated will be transformed where 
appropriate or an alternative model used. For count outcomes (e.g., dft accumulated  over time), 
we will use a loglinear model (log link) assuming a negative binomial or other appropriate (e.g., 
zero-inflated negative binomial) distribution. For proportion outcomes (e.g., dt/dft), we will use 
GEE with a logit link, assuming the proportion  follows a beta binomial or zero -inflated beta 
binomial distribution (Albert et al 2014). Similarly, we will fit appropriate GEE  models to test for 
the effect of each implementation strategy on the corresponding outcome (e.g., % prescriptions 
given as a m easure of adoption). As in the dental attendance analysis, the intervention indicator 
as well as pertinent baseline variables will be included in the model. In addition, interaction 
terms (baseline variables by [CONTACT_52886]) will be included to test for po ssible effect modification.  
For secondary analyses, a GLIMMIX model approach will be considered as an alternative, 
which may more easily allow for more than one cluster level if needed. Another alternative 
approach is to model the repeated measurements (a gain using GEE or GLIMMIX) which will 
add an additional cluster level – namely, for individuals). Goodness of fit of alternative models 
will be compared using QIC for GEE (or AIC for GLIMMIX).  
In the likely event of missing responses, we will first assess (In the context of repeated 
measures analyses) whether the data are missing completely at random (MCAR), that is, 
whether missingness of the given outcome is dependent only on participant baseline 
characteristics and not further on the observed outcome at an earlier time. This will be done by 
[CONTACT_189972] a GEE 
(or GLIMMIX) approach with a logit link and including appropriate baseline (control) variables 
and the outcome at the previous time if available. The MCAR null hypothesis will be rejected if 
the previous outcome has a statistically significant effect on the probability of missing. A 
nonsignificant effect would support the use of GEE (which assumes MCAR). The missing at 
random (MAR ) assumption (that missing is not related to unobserved measurements), which is 
made in the GLIMMIX approach or under certain multiple imputation approaches, is not readily 
tested empi[INVESTIGATOR_3675], but will be evaluated via scientific/contextual considerations.  
If the MCAR assumption is found to be violated we will use a multiple imputation (MI) approach 
in conjunction with the given GLIMMIX or GEE analysis using a suitable imputation model (i.e., 
using nonmissing outcome measurements as predictors of missing va lues). MI may also be 
considered if the MAR assumption is questioned for either GLIMMIX or GEE analyses.  
In addition to assessing the overall effects of the interventions, we will investigate the 
mechanisms (or paths) through which interventions impact de ntal attendance. As represented in 
Figure 4.2.1, we hypothesize that significant portions of the intervention effect will occur through 
each of several paths. For example, intervention may affect provider variables (such as 
knowledge and self -efficacy) or practice variables (such as EMR documentation, practice 
readiness, climate, and attitude) which may in turn affect caregiver illness representation which 
may in turn affect child dental attendance. Alternatively, provider variables may affect child 
dental attendance via implementation outcomes. Summary measures may be used for some 
related mediators. For example, we will consider an overall average score for the multiple item 
scores for caregiver illness representation. We will also include and assess media tors that will

Protocol # [ADDRESS_225089] mediated by ‘compliance’ with 
regard to EMR documentation. A relatively high mediat ion proportion will suggest efficacy of the 
corresponding component.  
We have previously developed a generalized causal mediation (GCM) analysis methodology 
and an accompanying R package(Albert & Nelson, 2011; Albert, Unpublished; Cho & Albert, 
Unpublished ) which we will use to estimate and test each path effect and its proportion of the 
total intervention effect. The GCM method allows mediators and final outcomes of different 
types, including continuous, binary, and count (assumed to have normal, Bernoulli , and Poisson 
or negative binomial distributions, respectively). These options will accommodate the mediators 
and final outcome (dental attendance, summarized as a binary response) in our model. Each 
outcome (including mediators) is modeled using a general ized linear model that includes as 
covariates possible baseline confounders as well as causally preceding variables according to 
the causal model (as in Figure 4.2.1). The method uses an extended version of the mediation 
formula and assumes an extended ver sion of the sequential ignorability assumption.(Albert et 
al., Unpublished) Bootstrap resampling is used to compute confidence intervals and a cluster 
bootstrap option is available to account for unexplained between -cluster (e.g. provider) 
variability.  
Adjustment for Baseline Characteristics:   Estimated intervention effects will be adjusted for the 
following baseline socio -demographic variables: child’s age, race, and caregiver SES, 
education, and marital status.  
Model Assumptions:  We will assume that the  probabilities of dental care receipt follow a logistic 
regression model with the included covariates and random effects. Per the standard approach, 
random effects will be assumed to be independent, normally distributed, and outcomes 
assumed conditionally independent given the random effects. If multiple random effects (e.g., 
for different cluster levels) are used, they will be assumed to be independent. For secondary 
outcomes, analogous assumptions, including the assumption of the correct link function, wi ll be 
made.  
Evaluations for the development of the Tool Kit : We will develop a tool kit containing the oral 
health didactic and skills curriculum, and resources (for providers and parents) that can be 
distributed to professional organizations (AAP, AAPD, A DA, AANP). This tool kit will be based 
on the results of the cRCT and will contain OH activities that have demonstrated to be effective, 
have content that is easy to tailor and apply for stakeholders beyond the study participants, and 
a table of contents f or navigation to the relevant content. Specifically, the results of the cRCT 
(effectiveness of arm A vs. arm B), process outcomes from the cRCT (provider adoption, 
implementation metrics such as score cards of EMR audits and parent exit survey, 
costeffecti veness analysis) will be combined with the structured interview data that will be 
collected from the providers to evaluate the dissemination/diffusion strategy to be used for the 
tool kit. The newly developed OH tool kit would be reviewed by a random sampl e of 20% of 
participating primary care providers (≈12 providers) to obtain their views and input on whether 
the tool kit is easy to understand; use; provides the necessary information for the delivery of 
evidence -based oral health care in primary care sett ings; and to solicit any changes to be made.

14.2 Study Intervention and Study Questionnaires  
14.2.1 Quality Assurance Procedures  
Study -Site Specific:  
Study staff who will recruit and interact with parents/caregivers at the practices, and document 
study activities will attend i n-person training which will incorporate the topi[INVESTIGATOR_87040], Good Clinical Practice (GCP), and adherence to the study protocol. As part of 
tracking and managing study records, staff members will learn how to document activities that 
occur with subjects, update study documentation and use the tracking and audit logs. To assess 
proficiency, the study staff will be certified in the topi[INVESTIGATOR_87041].  
In addition, all study staff will be trai ned to make calls during the dedicated staff training. A script 
for each type of call will be created and adherence to the script for study staff telephone contact 
[CONTACT_189978]’s’ caregivers that might influence the outcome. (To be 
detailed further in MOP section 5).  
Additionally, the dental hygienists will undergo calibration exercises prior to the main study to 
become proficient in exam re lated study procedures and to maintain intra - and inter -examiner 
agreement.  The gold standard examiner will calibrate/train the examiners in the ICDAS protocol 
in a [ADDRESS_225090] 
access to the results of the baseline examination to avoid detec tion bias.  
On the practice level, enhancements to the EMR system to include OH will be implemented 
prior to enrolling any parent/child dyad into the study. Providers will be trained and given a 
manual for EMR documentation for future reference. Study staf f will receive formal training to 
evaluate providers’ oral health encounters (through observation or audiotapi[INVESTIGATOR_007]), perform audits 
of EMR documentation, and provide score card feedback to providers. Prior to enrollment of 
parent/caregivers, study staff will  be trained by [CONTACT_189979] a 60 -minute 
session. Training will focus on evaluation of providers’ skills during oral health encounters with 
caregivers.

Protocol # [ADDRESS_225091]. Booster training will be conducted yearly or as 
needed if there are deviations in protocol.  
CC Specific:  
Before formal data entry begins, appropriate study staff will be trained on a custom -configured, 
study -specific Electronic Data Capture (EDC) test system. This procedure is for data entry 
training and user acceptance testing, concurrently. After  completing didactic training, staff 
trainees will enter pre -specified test data into the test EDC system, including invalid data, to 
provide additional training and familiarity with the data entry process. Their entered data will be 
compared against the p re-specified test data. After completion of training, staff members will be 
granted permission to use the EDC production environment for collection of project data.  
14.2.2 Quality Control Procedures  
Study -Site Specific:  
Data quality control is primarily conducted at the study team level through internal processes of 
data review/data monitoring as the data is collected and through periodic custom reports 
generated by [CONTACT_122456] (See Table 16.4.1). Dental screening data will be  reviewed for accuracy 
and completeness after each study visit by [CONTACT_87125].  The Research Assistants will 
review the questionnaires after the participants have completed them. Each paper form and 
questionnaire will be entered and verified by [CONTACT_184665] o separate individuals.  Forms completed 
electronically via tablets will be checked by [CONTACT_189980]/caregiver leaving the 
WCV. Any field that is unclear will be clarified with the parent/caregiver who completed the 
document.   
In additio n, the first five (5) study staff telephone contacts (reminder calls to return the B1 
questionnaires) will be audio recorded in digital media and reviewed. Then, the first five (5) B2 
follow -up calls will be recorded and reviewed for each staff member.  At  the beginning of the 
study, the Project Coordinator will review the first five telephone contacts to ensure fidelity of the 
calls and accuracy of data recording. Study staff will be provided with feedback on their 
performance and conduct including but not  limited to these specific areas; adherence to 
telephone script, adherence to protocol/MOP, adherence to good clinical practice. Study staff 
with telephone contact [CONTACT_189981] a private training session 
focused on problem atic areas.  This QC activity will take place until the first five sessions have 
been completed.  This will ensure that any weaknesses in study protocol will be addressed 
early.   
All study forms and questionnaires collected and entered into the database w ill be checked for 
inconsistencies and range and assessed for missing data.  Any inconsistencies, outliers, or 
missing data observed will be compared to the paper document and appropriate corrective 
actions carried out. REDCap’s native data resolution work flow will be used to document and fix 
any data anomalies. The Data Manager will also respond to data queries generated by [CONTACT_978], 
Study Coordinator, or other study staff.

Protocol # 17 -082-E       4 April 2022  
59 CC Specific:  
The CC will assist with the design of custom reports. Utilization of an  EDC system, such as 
REDCap, means that automated data checks can be implemented within the data entry system. 
This helps to prevent most errors immediately. The automated checks are also supported by [CONTACT_189982].   
The CC will create a standalone Data Validation Plan (DVP). The DVP will describe in more 
specific detail the edit -checks that will be performed within the EDC system and the  SOPs for 
data entry and quality management. The CC Clinical Research Specialist and the Data Manager 
assigned to the specific project, together with the study team, will be responsible for the 
creation, testing, and finalization of the DVP for the project . 
Following collection of all data from a project, additional data processing will be required by [CONTACT_189983], e.g., longitudinal coding of dental examination data, creation of psychosocial scale scores.  
In conjunction with that data processing, The CC will ru n regular validation reports to detect data 
anomalies and will work with the local project staff to resolve any data anomalies that arise 
during data entry. Following PI [INVESTIGATOR_87042], the database will be locked .

16.2 Data Capture Methods  
Data for this study will be captured using dental screenings, forms, questionnaires, and audio 
recordings.  Study data will be collected and stored using the REDCap platform hosted by 
[INVESTIGATOR_113678] -San Francisco, the home insti tution of the CC. The UCSF Coordinating 
Center will end its coordinating activities at the conclusion of their funding period. However, our 
study activities and funding will go on beyond the time when CC ends its activities, therefore the 
CC has indicated that it will transfer all data from UCSF REDCap to UHHS REDCap so that the 
study team can complete its data collection, entry, checking, and analysis activities. The data 
will be transferred in a secure manner to UHHS REDCap and all data for the study will  then 
reside in UHHS REDCap. REDCap is a secure, web -based application designed to support 
remote data capture for research studies, providing: 1) an intuitive interface for validated data 
entry, 2) audit trails for tracking data manipulation and export pr ocedures, 3) automated export 
procedures for seamless data downloads to common statistical packages, and 4) procedures for 
importing data from external sources.  
Study forms will be completed by [CONTACT_189985], and subsequently entered into REDCap 
by [CONTACT_464], or on a tablet directly into REDCap. Paper forms will be securely stored in a 
locked file cabinet. Recorded audio will be deleted from the digital recording device immediately 
after being stored on a secure CWRU School of Dental Medicine netw ork drive.   
16.3 Types of Data  
Data for this study will include: (1) dental screening data, (2) study questionnaires, (3) 
abstracted medical data, (4) abstracted Medicaid dental claims data, (5) cost data (6) data from 
observation/audiotapi[INVESTIGATOR_189930], (7) EMR audit data, and (8) structured interview 
transcripts.  Additionally, audio recordings will be used for fidelity monitoring and to capture 
responses from the provider structured interviews. Form revisions should be minimal; however, 
shoul d they occur, changes will be submitted to the CC for updating and dissemination to study 
staff.

project staff to resolve any data anomalies that arise during data entry. REDCap’s native data 
resolution workflow will be used to document and fix any data an omalies. The Data Manager  will 
also respond to data queries generated by [CONTACT_978], Study Coordinator, or other study staff.  
At the completion of the study, the study Biostatistician will conduct analyses of the data and 
assist in preparation of study publica tions and presentations. The Data Manager will provide 
technical and data support for the Biostatistician throughout the study.  
Coordinating Center (CC) : 
The CC will generate regular reports showing enrollment and potential data anomalies, which 
will be se nt to PIs, Project Coordinators, and other relevant study staff. The CC will generate a 
monthly enrollment report (or as requested by [CONTACT_189989]) for sharing 
progress of the study (see table 16.4 above).

 SYNOPSIS  
Sponsor : Silk Technologies , Ltd.  
Nam e of Finished Product:  SDP-4 Ophthalmic Solution  
Name [CONTACT_3261]:  Silk-Derived Protein -4 (SDP -4) 
Study  Title : 
A Phase 2, Multicenter, Double -Masked, Randomized, Vehicle -Controlled , Parallel -Group , 
Dose -Response  Study of SDP -4 Ophthalmic Solutio n in Subjects with Dry Eye Disease  (DED)  
Study Number:  SDP-4-CS201  
Study Phase:  2 
Primary Objective:   
Assess the safety and efficacy of SDP -4 ophthalmic solution in subjects with DED  over a 12 -week (84-
day) treatment period . 
Study Design : 
This is a Phase 2, multicenter, double -masked, randomized, vehicle -controlled, dose -response, parallel -
group study designed to evaluate the ocular and systemic safety and efficacy of SDP -4 ophthalmic 
solution in subjects with moderate to severe DED in both  eyes (OU)  over a 12 -week  (84-day) treatment 
period.  
Subjects will be randomized to 1 of 3 concentrations (0.1%, 1.0% and 3.0%) of SDP -4 Ophthalmic 
Solution or vehicle in a 1:1:1:[ADDRESS_1143655] ( SDP-4 
concentration s and vehicle ) will be provided in single -use doses (SUDs)  contained in foil pouches . 
Subjects, the Investigator , and all site personnel responsible for performing study assessments will 
remain masked to treatment assignment.  
Investigational product (IP)  will be administered via topi[INVESTIGATOR_824661], one drop per eye, twice 
daily (BID) for 12 weeks  (84 days) . Both eyes will be treated. A 2-week screening/ run-in period  on 
BID vehicle will precede the [ADDRESS_1143656] a Symptom Assessment in Dry Eye (SANDE) total score of ≥ 40 at 
Visit  1/Screening and Visit 2/Day 1 to ente r the trial. For subjects  with a qualifying SANDE score who 
meet all other inclusion/exclusion criteria, t he eye with the lower  tear break -up time (TBUT)  at Visit 
2/Day [ADDRESS_1143657] the same TBUT score s, the eye 
with the lower Schirmer’s test score  will be designated as the study eye . If both eyes have the same 
TBUT and Schirmer’s test score s, the right eye will be designated as the study eye.  
The study will consist of 7 clinic visits, 2 visits during the screening period and 5 on -treatment visits: 
Visit 1 (Day -14 ± 2 /Screening Visit), follow ed by [CONTACT_941] 2-week run -in on BID vehicle , Visit 2 
(Day  1/Confirmatory and Randomization Visit), Visit 3 (Day 7 ± 2), Visit 4 (Day  14 ± 2), Visit 5 (Day 
28 ± 2 ), Visit 6 (Day 56 ± 4) and Visit 7 (Day 84 ± 4/End of Study Assessments).   
If a subject complains of  persistent dry eye symptoms, the site may provide the subject with 
unpreserved artificial tears  (provided by [CONTACT_1034]) , to be used only if necessary. T he subject must 
return all used and unused artificial tears at each visit so the site  can conduct  accountability to assess 
the use of artificial tears . Artificial tears may not be used within 2 hours prior to any study visit.  
Study Population :  
Number of Subjects Planned:  
A total of 300 randomized subjects are planned, with 75 subjects assigned  to each dose group of SDP -4 
Ophthalmic Solution (0.1%, 1.0% and 3.0%) or vehicle.  SDP_4_CS201_Protocol AM1_03Apr2019 | VV-TMF-[ZIP_CODE] | 1.0

 1. INTRODUCTION  
Silk-derived protein -4 (SDP -4) is a novel biotherapeutic being developed by [CONTACT_824696] , Ltd. (Silk Te chnologies) as a treatment for the signs and symptoms of dry eye 
disease (DED). Dry eye disease , as defined by [CONTACT_824697]  
(TFOS) Dry Eye Workshop  (DEWS) II, is a “ multifactorial disease of the ocular surface 
characterized by [CONTACT_824698], 
in which tear film instability and hyperosmolarity, ocular surface inflammation and damage, 
and neurosensory abnormalities play etiological roles” ( Craig et al ., 2017 ).  
The disease re sults in corneal irregularities that can create sight -limiting outcomes over time 
due to chronic inflammation governed by [CONTACT_824699] κB (NF -κB) signaling, which is 
thought to play a significant role in disease pathogenesis ( Lan et al., 2012 ). Inflammatory 
mediators regulated by [CONTACT_153542]-κB, such as matrix metalloprotease ( MMP )-9, tumor necrosis 
factor alpha (TNF -α), and interleukin (IL) -[ADDRESS_1143675] been found in the tear fluid  at high 
concentrations in patients exhibiting  severe  DED ( Solomon et al., 2001 ; Smith et al., 2001 ). 
Furthermore, t opi[INVESTIGATOR_824670] -9 to DED  MMP -9-knockout mice subjected to 
dry eye via cholinergic blockade  significantly  increase s corneal epi[INVESTIGATOR_322483] , 
implicating MMP -9 in increased corneal epi[INVESTIGATOR_824671] n and damage ( Pflugfelder et al., 
2005 ). Collectively, these observations suggest a relationship between disruption of the 
corneal epi[INVESTIGATOR_2130], increased secretion of MMP -9 through NF -κB signaling, and the signs 
and symptoms of DED.  
Silk fibroin protein  is the primary fibrous component of the Bombyx mori  silkworm cocoon.  
In vivo , aqueous silk fibroin protein solution was successfully used to treat DED in a murine 
animal model, improving clinical outcomes (increased tear production, decreased corneal 
irregularity, inhibited epi[INVESTIGATOR_824672], and increased goblet cell density) and 
reducing inflammatory cytokine presence (intercellular adhesion molecule [ICAM] -1, 
vascular cell adhesion molecule [VCAM] -1, MMP -2 and MMP -9) (Kim et al, 2017 ).  
Silk-derived protein (SDP) is a partially hydrolyzed population derived from the silk fiber 
protein fibroin with a molecular weight (MW) distribution of 2000 –300, 000 Daltons (Da).  
In vitro  studies in immortalized hCLE cell s subjected to scratch wound denu dement 
demonstrated that aqueous SDP improved corneal epi[INVESTIGATOR_824673], proliferation and enhanced cell -matrix attachment ( Abdel -Naby [CONTACT_199145]., 2017 ). Cultures treated with SDP displayed significant increases in cel l-matrix focal 
adhesion formation and basement membrane adhesive strength compared to untreated 
cultures. In vivo , treatment with SDP accelerated the acute healing phase of injured rabbit 
corneal epi[INVESTIGATOR_27771], as shown by [CONTACT_824700], and 
produced a dose -dependent, 8 -fold decrease in MMP -9.  
Through a series of additional manufacturing steps, the subpopulation , SDP-4, is produced 
with a MW range of 10,000 -30,000  Da. In nonclinical studies, SDP-4 has demonstrated a 
dual mechanism of action that both inhibits inflammation and physically improves the 
stability of the tear film. SDP-4 inhibits NF -κB driven expression of known dry eye 
inflammatory mediators produced by [CONTACT_791404] , inclu ding MMP -9, TNF -α, and 
IL-8.  SDP_4_CS201_Protocol AM1_03Apr2019 | VV-TMF-[ZIP_CODE] | 1.0

SDP-4-CS201 Protocol  SDP4_CS201_pro_FA -1.docx /[ADDRESS_1143676] impairment of NF-κB activity by [CONTACT_173423] -4 was 
confirmed using a human embryonic kidney cell  line containing a NF -κB-responsive reporter 
gene. SDP -4 inhibited reporter gene expression dose dependently at concentrations ranging 
from 0.1% -10%.  
Cardiovascular and respi[INVESTIGATOR_824674] t, respectively, with SDP -4 administered by [CONTACT_33980] (IV) injection. No statistically 
significant effects on respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], tidal volume or minute volume or on cardiovascular 
function, e.g., electrocardiographic waveforms, QT, heart rate, were observ ed at doses of 0, 
10, 50 and 75 mg/kg.  
The pi[INVESTIGATOR_22735] 90 -day toxicity study in rabbits was conducted at SDP -4 concentrations of 0% 
(vehicle), 1%, 3%, 5% or 10% instilled four times/day into both eyes. Ocular findings in all 
groups, including controls, occurre d sporadically throughout the dosing phase with no 
relationship to dose or duration of treatment. Irritation observed during the study tended to 
resolve during the dosing phase as the study progressed. No histopathological changes in the 
ocular tissue were  observed. Plasma levels of SDP -4 were either below the lower limit of 
quantification (LLOQ) or approximated the LLOQ at the highest dose. Based on the results, 
the no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) for this study was 10%, the highest dose 
examined.  
A pi[INVESTIGATOR_22735] 28 -day IV toxicity study in rats was undertaken at doses of 0, 10, 50 and 75  mg/kg. 
No SDP -4-related toxicity was observed. Microscopi[INVESTIGATOR_897], dose -related cytoplasmic 
vacuolation was noted in the proximal convoluted tubule segment of the renal ne phron, 
which was reduced in severity following the [ADDRESS_1143677] for the initial Phase 2 clinical trial. Based on the 
results of the toxicology program, the estimated margin of safety on a body surface area basis 
was determined to be 1 28-fold. Therefore, ocular instillation of SDP -4 twice daily to patients 
with a maximum clinical concentration of 3% administered twice daily for up to [ADDRESS_1143678] in human (FIH) study is a multicenter, double -masked, 
randomized, vehicle -controlled, dose -response, parallel -group study designed to evaluate the 
ocular and systemic safety and efficacy of SDP -4 in subjects with moderate to severe DED in 
both eyes over a 12 -week  (84-day) treatment period.  For additional information regarding

 3. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
3.1. Overall Study Design and Plan  
This is a Ph ase 2, multicenter, double -masked, randomized, vehicle -controlled, dose -
response, parallel -group study designed to evaluate the ocular and systemic safety and 
efficacy of SDP -4 ophthalmic solution in subjects with moderate to severe DED in both eyes  
(OU)  over a 12 -week (84-day) treatment period.  
Subjects will be randomized to 1 of 3 concentrations (0.1%, 1.0% and 3.0%) of SDP -4 
Ophthalmic Solution or vehicle in a 1:1:1:[ADDRESS_1143679] ( IP) (SDP-4 concentrations and v ehicle ) will be provided in single -use dose (SUD)  
containers seal packed into foil pouches. Subjects, the Investigator , and all site personnel 
responsible for performing study assessments will remain masked to treatment assignment.  
The IP will be administered via topi[INVESTIGATOR_824661], one drop per eye, twice daily 
(BID) for 12 weeks  (84 days) . Both eyes will be tr eated. A 2-week screening/ run-in period 
on BID vehicle will precede the [ADDRESS_1143680] a Symptom Assessment in Dry Eye (SANDE) total score of ≥ 40 at 
Visit  1/Screening and Visit 2/Day 1 to enter the trial. For subjects with a qualifying SANDE 
score who meet all other inclusion/exclusion criteria, t he eye with the lower tear break -up 
time (TBUT) at Visit 2/Day [ADDRESS_1143681] 
the same TBUT scores, the eye with the lo wer Schirmer’s test score will be designated as the 
study eye. If both eyes have the same TBUT and Schirmer’s test scores, the right eye will be 
designated as the study eye.  
The study will consist of 7 clinic visits, 2 visits during the screening period an d 
5 on-treatment visits: Visit 1 (Day -14 ± 2/Screening Visit), follow ed by [CONTACT_941] 2-week run -in 
period on BID vehicle , Visit 2 (Day 1/Confirmatory and Randomization Visit), Visit 3 
(Day  7 ± 2), Visit 4 (Day 14 ± 2), Visit 5 (Day 28 ± 2), Visit 6 (Day 56 ± 4)  and Visit 7 
(Day  84 ± 4/End of Study Assessments).   
If a subject complains of persistent dry eye symptoms, the site may provide the s ubject with 
unpreserved artificial tears  (provided by [CONTACT_1034]) , to be used only if necessary. The 
subject must return all used and unused artificial tears at each visit so  the site can conduct 
accountability to assess the use of artificial tears. Artificial tears may not be used within 
2 hours prior to any study visit.  
See Table 1, Schedule of Visits and Examinations . 
3.2. Rationale for Study Design and Control Group  
It is hypothesized that by [CONTACT_824701]-inflammatory mediato rs of DED , and providing a 
mucin replacement to enhance spreading and wetting of the tear film, SDP-4 may produce 
improvement in the symptoms of DED , as measured by [CONTACT_824702],  and in the 
physical characteristics of the tear film, as measured by  [CONTACT_824703] . These are designated primary  
(SANDE)  and secondary (TBUT) endpoints . The study is also designed to measure 
additional secondary endpoints including individual symptoms  (itching , foreign body 
sensation , burning/stinging , fluctuating vision , eye dryness , eye discomfort , photophobia , and SDP_4_CS201_Protocol AM1_03Apr2019 | VV-TMF-[ZIP_CODE] | 1.0

 eye pain ) and additional signs  (anesthetized  Schirmer’s test , corneal fluorescein staining , 
conjunctival lissamine green staining , and c onjunctival hyperemia ). Three concentrations of 
SDP-4, (0.1%, 1.0% and 3.0%)  will be dosed topi[INVESTIGATOR_824675] e 
hypothes es of this protocol. The SDP-4 concentrations are among those shown in nonclinical 
pharmacology studies to be effective in inhibiting inflammatory mediators , with the 1% 
concentration pr oducing maximal inhibition of NF-κB activity. The 12-week  (84-day) 
treatment period allows adequate assessment of the comparative efficacy of the IP 
concentrations being compared and their effects over time.  The control is the vehicle without 
the active ingredient of the drug product to be used in the study.  
3.3. Study Duration and Dates  
The duration of study treatment is 12 weeks  (84 days) . The overall duration of the study is 
14 weeks, which includes a 2 -week screening/ run-in period on vehicl e and 12 weeks of 
treatment.  SDP_4_CS201_Protocol AM1_03Apr2019 | VV-TMF-[ZIP_CODE] | 1.0

administered during the 14 -day (± 2) screening/run -in period.  
5.2. Selection , Timing  and Administration  of Dose for Each Patient  
Subjects will be randomized to treatment with 1 of 3 concentrations (0.1%, 1.0% and 3.0%) 
of SDP -4 Ophthalmic Solution or vehicle  whic h will be administered to each eye BID, 
approximately 12  hours apart , for 84 days.  
Subjects (or their caregiver, if the subject is not able to self -administer the IP) will administer 
IP topi[INVESTIGATOR_824681] [ADDRESS_1143686] (or caregiver) in topi[INVESTIGATOR_824682]. After 
instilling a drop in each eye, the  used single -use dose ( SUD ) should be stored in the storage 
container provided by [CONTACT_824704].  
Twice each day, approximately [ADDRESS_1143687] (or caregiver) will open a new 
SUD  and administer [ADDRESS_1143688] it in 
the box  (or storage container)  for return to the cli nical site  so accountability can be 
documented in the source document and electronic case report form (eCRF) . All IP, 
including  the box, used SUDs /foil pouches and any unopened SUDs will be returned to the 
clinical site where the used and unopened IP will be documented  at Visits 2 through 7 .  
5.3. Method of Assigning Patient s to Treatment Groups  
Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to 0.1%, 1.0% or 3.0%  SDP-4 or vehicle in 
parallel groups. A computer -generated randomization code for allocating the solu tions will 
be prepared by [CONTACT_824705] -to-day 
running of the study.  
If subjects meet eligibility criteria at Screening (Visit 1 /Day -14) and Visit  2/Day 1  (see 
Section  4 for eligibility criteria), subjects will be randomly assigned to IP at Visit 2 . Clinical 
sites will utilize the Interactive Web Response System (IW RS) to assign kits to subjects. The 
IP kit randomization number will be recorded in the subject’s eCRF . The randomized IP may 
vary slightly in hue from nearly clear to a slight tint. This variability is normal.  SDP_4_CS201_Protocol AM1_03Apr2019 | VV-TMF-[ZIP_CODE] | 1.0

SDP-4-CS201 Protocol  SDP4_CS201_pro_FA -1.docx /[ADDRESS_1143689]’s treatment assignment in case of emergency, the 
Investigator  may obtain the treatment code for a given randomized subject from the IWRS . 
The treatment  code is to be obtained only if a medical emergency exists and knowledge of 
the medication being taken will influence the medical management of the subject.  
The following procedure should be followed:  
1. The Investigator should contact [CONTACT_824706] a subject, unless it is not possible to do so without risk to the subject.  
2. The Investigator should document the serious adverse event (SAE) , if applicable , and 
justification for unmasking in the eCRF.  
3. The subje ct may continue to participate in the study  to be followed for safety  at the 
Investigator’s discretion. If the subject is to be discontinued from study participation, 
then ALL procedures described in the Early Discontinuation Visit ( Section  7.3) 
should be completed.  
4. The Investigator should contact [CONTACT_824707] (Oculos), the clinical 
research organization (CRO), at SilkTech -safety@ oculoscr .com  within [ADDRESS_1143690] initials, details of the adverse event (AE) or SAE, 
any action taken, and whether the subject is continuing in the study.  
5.5. Concomitant Therapy  
Therapy conside red necessary for the subject’s welfare that will not interfere with the 
evaluation of the IP may be given at the discretion of the Investigator and in consultation 
with the Medical Monitor. If there is any question as to whether the medication may 
interfere, the Investigator  should contact [CONTACT_279590].  
If a subject complains of persistent dry eye symptoms, the site may provide the s ubject with 
unpreserved artificial tears  (provided by [CONTACT_1034]) , to be used only i f necessary. The 
subject must return all used and unused artificial tears at each visit so  the site can conduct 
accountability to assess the use of artificial tears. Artificial tears may not be used within 2 
hours prior to any study visit ; the subject may either be rescheduled or may wait at the site 
until [ADDRESS_1143691] passed since instillation if this occurs .  
Permitted steroid medications  include intranasal, inhaled, dermatologic, or peri-anal,  
steroids . 
Whenever possible, medications should be administered in dosages that remain stable  
throughout the study duration. All concomitant medications will be recorded in the eCRF.  SDP_4_CS201_Protocol AM1_03Apr2019 | VV-TMF-[ZIP_CODE] | 1.0

Conjunctival hyperemia will be graded during the slit -lamp examination using the 
McMonnies ph otographic scale (McMonnies and Chapman , 1987a ; McMonnies and 
Chapman, 1987b ). This photographic reference scale consists of 6 levels or grades of 
conjunctival hyperemia (0 = none, 5 = severe). Please note that these were designed for

[IP_ADDRESS].  Conjunctival Lissamine Green Staining  
After corneal staining, lissamine green conjunc tival staining will be measured. Six (6) areas 
of the conjunctiva will be evaluated  (Figure  3) (Lemp, 1995 ). The Investigator will record a 
score for e ach area of each eye. The scores for each eye will be summed, excluding superior 
zones 2 and 4. Consult the Study Reference Manual for specific details regarding the 
evaluation procedures.

6.4. Adverse and Serious Adverse  Events  
6.4.1.  Definition of Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Adverse Event (AE)  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study subject administered a n IP that 
does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment . An AE can therefore be 
any unfavorable and uni ntended sign ( for example, an  abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an IP , whether or not considered 
related to this IP.  
Note: IP in this study refers to all concentrations of SDP -4 and to the vehicle  (control ). 
Medical conditions/diseases present before starting the investigational treatment are only 
considered AEs if they worsen after starting the investigational treatment. Abnormal test 
results constitute AEs only if they induce clinical sign s or symptoms, are considered 
clinically significant, or require therapy.  
The occurrence of AEs should be sought by [CONTACT_31463] -ended questioning of the subject at each 
visit during the study. At each clinic visit, study personnel should ask the following questio n: 
"Have you had any problems since your last visit?” Adverse event s also may be detected 
when they are volunteered by [CONTACT_245512].  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening  or sight -threatening  
Note: The term "life -threatening" refers to an event in which the subject was at 
risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which 
hypothetically might ha ve caused death if it were more severe.  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (excluding 
progression/outcome of the disease under study)  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_63995] g hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
• Is medically significant; i.e., defined as an event that jeopardizes the health of the 
subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed above  
Treatment on an outpatient emergency basis that doe s not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063], or a 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_31437] a preplanned treatment for a pre -existing condition that is SDP_4_CS201_Protocol AM1_03Apr2019 | VV-TMF-[ZIP_CODE] | 1.0

SDP-4-CS201 Protocol  SDP4_CS201_pro_FA -1.docx /[ADDRESS_1143701]  
The relationship of AEs to the IP should be assessed by [CONTACT_824710].  
Not suspected:  The temporal relationship of the event to the IP makes a causal relationship 
unlikely, or, other drugs, therapeutic interventions or underlying conditions provide a 
sufficient explanation for the observe d event.  
Suspected:  The temporal relationship of the event to the IP makes a causal relationship 
possible or other drugs, therapeutic interventions or underlying conditions do not provide a 
sufficient explanation for the observed event.  
If there is any val id reason, even if undetermined, for suspecting a possible cause -and-effect 
relationship between the IP and the occurrence of the AE, then the AE should be considered 
“suspected.”  
If the relationship between the AE/SAE and the IP is determined by [CONTACT_824711] 
“suspected” the event will be considered to be related to the IP for the purposes of expedited 
regulatory reporting.  
6.6. Recording Adverse Events  
Adverse events  (AEs)  spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_3184]/or in response to an open 
question from th e study personnel or revealed by [CONTACT_4171], regardless of severity or 
potential association with the IP or study procedures, will be recorded in the eCRF. Changes 
from baseline assessments that are part of the disease being studied will not necessarily be 
recorded as AEs unless the Investigator deems them as such. Investigators are advised to 
consider reporting an increase in IOP of 10 mmHg or greater, or a visual acuity decrease of 3 
lines EDTRS (15 letters) or greater  as an AE .  If ongoing at the time of the subject's last 
study visit, Investigators should follow the event until the subject has returned to baseline or 
the event has resolved.   
All AEs that occur following consent and until the final study visit ( Visit 7/Day 84 ) should 
be collected and recorded on the AE eCRF page.  AEs that occur during the screening/ run-in 
period (Visit 1/Day -14 ± 2 to Visit 2/Day 1) will be summarized separately from AEs th at 
occur from the first dose of double -masked treatment on Day 1 to the Day 84 Visit or Early 
Discontinuation . Serious adverse events (SAEs) will be followed until the event is resolved 
or stabilized.  SDP_4_CS201_Protocol AM1_03Apr2019 | VV-TMF-[ZIP_CODE] | 1.0

SDP-4-CS201 Protocol  SDP4_CS201_pro_FA -1.docx /[ADDRESS_1143702] medical term inology when possible. For each 
AE, the Investigator will evaluate and report the following:  
• Onset (date)  
• Resolution (date)  
• Severity grade (mild, moderate, severe)  
• Relationship to IP (not suspected, suspected)  
• Action taken (none, IP temporarily interrupted, IP permanently discontinued; 
concomitant medication taken; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]/prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; other)  
• Serious outcome (yes/no)  
The severity grade should be determined by [CONTACT_31467] : 
• Mild : Discomfort noticed but no disruption of normal daily activity  
• Moderate : Discomfort sufficient to cause interference with normal daily activity  
• Severe : Incapacitating, with inability to perform normal activities  
It is important to distinguish between serious  and severe AEs. Severity is a measure of 
intensity (as defined directly above) whereas seriousness is defined by [CONTACT_824712]  [IP_ADDRESS] . An AE of severe intensity may not be considered serious.  
Should a pregnancy occur, it must be reported and recorded on the pregnancy form. 
Pregnancy in itself is not regarded as an AE unless there is a suspi[INVESTIGATOR_824688] a contraceptive medication.  The subject will stop using 
the IP, be withdrawn from the study, and followed through conclusion of pregnancy. The 
outcome of all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, normal birth or 
congeni tal abnormality) must be followed up and documented.  
6.7. Reporting Adverse Events  
All AEs ( suspected  and not suspected ) will be recorded following consent and until the final 
study visit, Visit 7/Day 84 . Any SAEs “suspected” to be related to the IP and discovered by 
[CONTACT_7201].  
Any SAE that occurs must be reported within [ADDRESS_1143703] should be maintained at the site with a copy emailed to 
SilkTech -[EMAIL_15701]  only if requested and after thorough de -identification/  
removal of all personal health information (PHI) . The Investigator must assess the SAE 
relationship to the IP/study treatment and severity and complete the SAE form. Silk 
Technologies /Oculos  may request additional information. Follow -up information ( e.g., SDP_4_CS201_Protocol AM1_03Apr2019 | VV-TMF-[ZIP_CODE] | 1.0

 discharge summary) will be retained in the subject’s chart and a copy will be emailed to 
SilkTech -Safety@ oculoscr .com . 
In addition, all SAEs should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF page with the serious 
question marked “Yes”.  
All subjects who experience an SAE should be followed clinically and undergo the 
appropriate diagnostic evaluations until stabilization or resolution of the event.  
It is the Investigator ’s responsibility to no tify the approving IRB of any site-specific SAEs 
per the IRB’s reporting requirements . 
Silk Technologies  will report all SAEs to the [LOCATION_002] ( US) Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) on the appropriate schedule depending if the event is IP related or not 
IP related, expected  or unexpected (based on the available information in the IB). 
Any death occurring during the study and follow up period should be reported as an SAE. 
For any death occurring through the end of the study, regardless of the degree of relationship 
to IP, the SAE resulting in the death must be reported to Silk Technologies or designee . A 
death occurring after completion of the study d oes not require completion of the SAE form.  
6.8. Other Safety Assessments  
6.8.1.  Best-Corrected Visual Acuity  
Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) measurement will be performed in each eye at all study 
visits with the logMAR eye chart  using the subject’s best correctiv e lens prescription 
eyeglasses or trial frame lenses, if applicable . The subject's BCVA must be determined (via 
refraction) if corrected or uncorrected visual acuity is not logMAR 0.0 (equivalent to 20/20). 
This refraction must be used for all VA assessmen ts for the duration of the study. The subject 
must wear the same glasses/trial frame, if applicable, at each visit.  Ambient room  lighting 
should be consistent for a given subject throughout the study period . Consult the Study 
Reference Manual for specific details regarding the evaluation procedures.  
6.8.2.  Biomicroscopy and External Eye Exam  
A slit -lamp examination will be conducted at each study visit to assess the anterior ocular 
structures, including lid, cornea, conjunctiva, anterior chamber, iris, lens , and posterior 
capsule (if pseudophakic) . Abnormalities will be documented.  Consult the  Study Reference 
Manual for specific details regarding the evaluation procedures.  
6.8.3.  Dilated Fundus Exam  
A fundus exam consisting of the vitreous, optic nerve, macula, and peripheral retina will be 
conducted, and the structures will be graded as normal or abn ormal.  Consult the Study 
Reference Manual for specific details regarding the evaluation procedures.  
6.8.4.  Intraocular Pressure Measurement  
Intraocular pressure will be measured utilizing a Goldmann  tonometer . If possible, the same 
observer should perform the assessment and the same calibrated instrument  should be used 
for a given subject throughout the study.  To avoid IOP changes due to the diurnal rhythm, the SDP_4_CS201_Protocol AM1_03Apr2019 | VV-TMF-[ZIP_CODE] | 1.0

SDP-4-CS201 Protocol  SDP4_CS201_pro_FA -1.docx /[ADDRESS_1143704] Comfort Assessment  
Subjects will rate the comfort  of IP instillation according to the following 4 -point scale:  
0 = No disc omfort  
1 = Mild discomfort  
2 = Moderate discomfort  
3 = Severe discomfort  
6.9. Screen Failures  
A screen failure is a subject who has given informed consent and failed to meet the inclusion 
criteria or met at least 1 of the exclusion criteria, and has not been ra ndomized into the study. 
Based on Investigator discretion and Sponsor approval, subjects who initially failed to meet 
the inclusion/exclusion criteria may be rescreened at a later time if their eligibility status has 
changed. The subject will retain the sa me subject identification number that he/she was 
assigned at the first screening.  
6.10. Subject Withdrawal Criteria  
The following are the criteria for considering withdrawal from the study:  
• Withdrawal of subject consent . The subject may request for any reason at  any 
time to be withdrawn from the study.  
• The Sponsor terminates the study.  
If a subject withdraws from the study, the reason for withdrawal will be recorded in the 
eCRF.  
If a study subject fails to attend a study visit at any point during the study period , every effort 
should be made to keep the subject in the study and conduct all study visits as scheduled ; all 
attempts to contact [CONTACT_45316].  If the subject relocates during the study 
period, the CRO  should be contact[CONTACT_31452] a possibility that the subject 
could continue at another clinical site.  
6.11. Appropriateness  of Measurements  
The efficacy and safety assessments in this study are standard for ophthalmologic 
investigations, and their reliability, accuracy, and relevan ce is well established. Collection of 
AEs to monitor drug safety is standard in clinical studies . SDP_4_CS201_Protocol AM1_03Apr2019 | VV-TMF-[ZIP_CODE] | 1.0

 9. STATISTICS  
9.1. General Cons iderations  
This is a Phase 2 , multicenter , randomized, double -masked, vehicle -controlled, 
dose-response , parallel group  study to evaluate the ocular and systemic safety and efficacy of 
SDP-4 ophthalmic solution in subjects with moderate to severe DED . 
Subjects with DED are planned to be randomized to 1 of 3 concentrations of SDP -4 (0.1%, 
1.0%, or 3.0%) or vehicle  in a 1:1:1:1  ratio, with 75 subjects randomized to each group.  
A biostatistician will perform statistical analyses as agreed with the Sponsor acco rding to the 
Statistical Analysis Plan  (SAP) . 
All continuous study assessments will be summarized by [CONTACT_10659] (as applicable) 
using descriptive statistics (n, mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum). 
All categorical study assessm ents will be summarized by [CONTACT_10659] (as applicable) 
using frequency counts and percentages.  
All study data will be listed by [CONTACT_3148], subject,  and visit (as applicable).  
The unit of analysis for efficacy will be the study eye.  
Efficacy analys is will be conducted on the intent -to-treat (ITT) population (primary efficacy 
analysis) and the per protocol (PP) population (secondary efficacy analysis). Safety analyses 
will be performed using the safety analysis population . Definitions for the analysi s 
populations may be found in Section  9.3. 
9.2. Determination of Sample  Size 
A sample size of [ADDRESS_1143708] 80% power to detect a treatment 
difference of 11.7 units in SANDE total score and 1.2 seconds in TBUT at Visit 7/Day [ADDRESS_1143709] with a 0.05 two -sided significance level. This calculation is based on the 
assumptions shown in Table 2. Note: TBUT is one of several secondary outcomes planned to 
be analyzed, but the sample size was derived usin g assumptions based on expected SANDE 
and TBUT values. Over -enrollment of 5 subjects per group/20 subjects per study is planned 
to account for discontinuations.

 9.3. Analysis Populations  
9.3.1.  Intent -to-Treat (ITT) Population  
The ITT population will include all randomized subjects who received IP. This population 
will be the primary population for efficacy analyses and will be used to summarize all 
efficacy variables and will summar ize subjects as randomized.  
9.3.2.  Per Protocol (PP) Population  
The PP population is a subset of the ITT population, which will include all subjects who 
complete the study without major  protocol deviations . This population will be the secondary 
population for efficacy analyses and will be used to summarize a subset of efficacy variables. 
The PP population will summarize subjects as treated.  
9.3.3.  Safety Population  
The safety population will include all subjects who received IP. This population will be used 
to summarize safety variables and will summarize subjects as treated.  
9.4. Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
Subject demographic and baseline characteristics will be summarized in tables. Summary 
tables will  be supported with individual subject data listings.  
9.5. Efficacy  Endpoints  and Analyses  
9.5.1.  Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
Mean change from baseline in total SANDE score at Visit 7 /Day 84  
9.5.2.  Secondary  Efficacy Endpoint s 
• Mean and mean change from baseline at each visit  for each of the following 
evaluations:  
− Conjunctival lissamine green staining  (combined and each zone)  
− Corneal fluorescein staining  (combined a nd each zone)  
− TBUT  
− Anesthetized Schirmer’s test  
− Conjunctival hyperemia

− Mean total SANDE score at each visit  
− Mean and mean change from baseline in each component of SANDE at each 
visit 
9.5.3.  Efficacy Analyses  
The primary efficacy endpoint (SANDE) will be summarized using continuous summary 
statistics by [CONTACT_6982]. The primary analysis will utilize a repeated measures 
mixed model where the dependent variable is the change from baseline score, tr eatment 
group is a fixed effect, baseline score is a covariate, and visit is a repeated measure on 
subject . The repeated measures mixed model is utilized to account for the effect of missing 
data under the assumption that the data are missing at random. Least squares means will be 
used to test each concentration of SDP -[ADDRESS_1143712] (LOCF) as well as 
observed data only.  
In order to minimize the impact of m ultiplicity in this dose -response study, the following 
hierarchy for analyses will be conducted  (note: TBUT is one of several secondary outcomes 
planned to be analyzed, but the sample size was derived using assumptions based on 
expected SANDE and TBUT valu es): 
1. Primary (SANDE) high concentration vs. vehicle  
2. Primary (SANDE) middle concentration vs. vehicle  
3. Primary (SANDE) low concentration vs. vehicle  
4. Secondary (TBUT) high concentration vs. vehicle  
5. Secondary (TBUT) middle concentration vs. vehicle  
6. Secondary (TBUT) low concentration vs. vehicle  
The comparisons will be conducted at α = 0.05. Each comparison will be made in order until 
P > (exceeds) 0.05. If P ≤ 0.05, the comparison is statistically significant and testing is 
continued.  
The planned analyses for all efficacy outcomes will be described in detail  in the SAP , which 
will be finalized prior to database lock . 
9.6. Safety Variables and Analysis  
9.6.1.  Safety Variables  
Safety variables are as follows:  
• Ocular and non -ocular AE monitoring  
• BCVA  SDP_4_CS201_Protocol AM1_03Apr2019 | VV-TMF-[ZIP_CODE] | 1.0

 • Biomicroscopy  
• Intraocular pressure  
• Dilated fundus exam   
• IP comfort assessment  
9.6.2.  Safety Analysis  
Safety and IP comfort  data will be presented in tables of descriptive statist ics and frequency 
distribution. All summary tables will be supported with individual subject data listings.  
AEs that occur during the screening/ run-in period ( Visit 1/ Day-14 ± 2 to Visit 2/Day 1 ) will 
be summarized separately from AEs that occur from the f irst dose of double -masked 
treatment on Day 1 to the Day 84 Visit or Early Discontinuation . 
The primary safety analysis will summarize ocular and non -ocular treatment -emergent 
adverse events (TEAEs) using discrete summaries at the subject level by [CONTACT_57501] o rgan class 
and preferred term for each treatment group. A TEAE will be defined as occurring after the 
first dose of IP. Serious adverse events (SAEs) and treatment -related ocular and non -ocular 
TEAEs will be summarized similarly. Ocular and non -ocular TEAE s will also be 
summarized by [CONTACT_926].  
Biomicroscopy and dilated indirect ophthalmoscopy measures will be summarized by 
[CONTACT_824713] -baseline assessments   
Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA; logMAR) and IOP  (mm Hg) will be summarized at 
each visit, using continuous and discrete summary statistics, including change from baseline 
and the proportion of study eyes with pre -defined increases from baseline , specifically, eyes 
with a 3 -line decrease in BCVA or eyes with ≥ 10 mm Hg increase in IOP .  SDP_4_CS201_Protocol AM1_03Apr2019 | VV-TMF-[ZIP_CODE] | 1.0

be related to a specific individual subject will be released or used in any fashion without the 
signed written consent of that subject. All reports and communications relating to study 
subjects will identify subjects only by [CONTACT_143295]. Complete 
subject identification will be kept by [CONTACT_387758] -term follow -up, if 
needed. This information will be treated with strict adherence to professional standards o f 
confidentiality.  
10.5. Study Monitoring  
The study will be monitored by [CONTACT_824717]. 
Monitoring visits will occur as required and  could include a study initiation visit, monitoring 
visit(s), and a study close -out visit. Training will be provided for key investigative personnel 
in all aspects of study conduct. The Investigator will be responsible for making sure that site 
personnel are provided adequate training on conducting delegated tasks.   
Before a site can enter a subject into the study, a representative of the Sponsor will:  
• Determine the adequacy of the facilities  
• Discuss with the Investigator (s) and other personnel their responsibilities 
regarding protocol adherence and the responsibili ties of the Sponsor and or its 
representatives  
This study will utilize eDC to optimize the eCRF source verification process with limited 
separate source documentation. Monitors will review e -source data and overall study 
data/consistency remotely and query  discrepancies based upon eCRF entries (eCRF initial 
entry is the source). During this monitoring, data are reviewed as entered by [CONTACT_779], and the 
monitors will flag any abnormalities, trends, or safety signals for Medical Monitor review 
and monitor foll ow-up onsite, if necessary.  Refer to the Study Reference Manual  and/or 
Regulatory Binder  for details regarding the direct data entry of study assessments and 
requirements for maintaining additional source documentation via paper/medical record.  
During visi ts to the study site, the monitor may review the source documents including but 
not limited to signed informed consent forms, inclusion/exclusion checklist, medical/ocular 
history, concomitant medications, study material accountability and storage, complet ed 
SANDE questionnaires  and subject -completed VAS assessments , the reporting procedures 
for AEs , SAEs , and protocol deviations .  The CRA will review the study documents 
maintained in the Regulatory Binder to ensure all documentation is current and only qua lified 
and trained staff are appropriately delegated study related tasks.  The CRA will also review 
the site -specific processes and research -related SOPs to ensure appropriate Investigator 
oversight is being maintained and documented as required by [CONTACT_27727]/ICH . 
All data generated during this study and the medical records/documents from which they 
originated are subject to inspection by [CONTACT_221301] , the FDA, and other 
regulatory agencies. The Investigator must notify the Sponsor or designee promptly of any 
inspections scheduled by [CONTACT_12721].  SDP_4_CS201_Protocol AM1_03Apr2019 | VV-TMF-[ZIP_CODE] | 1.0

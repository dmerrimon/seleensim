1.0 Objectives  
1.1 Purpose:  
Determine  if cilostazol improves symptoms and NTproBNP levels (heart failure 
blood marker) in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) – a 
prevalent syndrome without evidence -based treatment.  
This will be assessed in a prospective 1-month single blinded study with 2 cross -
overs (n -of-1 study design with placebo and cilostazol)  
 
1.2 Primary outcome :  
1. standardized heart failure questionnaire   
(sample provided at the end of the consent document)  
1.3 Secondary  outcome : 
2. NTproBNP   
2.0 Background  
2.1 Significance of Research Question/Purpose:  
 
Heart failure (HF) is the #[ADDRESS_160270] a preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). There is no evidence -
based treatment for HFpEF. We recently reported that beta -blockers increase the 
risk for HF adm issions in HFpEF, in part by [CONTACT_141159] (1 -3). 
On the contrary, we found that elevating the heart rate with pacemakers conveys 
significant clinical benefits e.g. reduction in heart failure symptoms, lowering 
filling pressures and an increase in walk distance (4 -6). Cilostazol increases the 
heart rate by [CONTACT_2902] 5-8 beats per minute and has other potentially beneficial 
HFpEF effects such as peripheral vaso dilation , lusiotropic effects (acceleration of 
relaxation) and dromotropic effects (improved cardiac electrical conduction). By 
[CONTACT_141160] A , cilostazol may also phosphorylate titin, which would 
reduce  myocardial stiffness (6).  
  
2.2 Preliminary Data:  
 
Cilostazol is approved for the use in peripheral artery disease and has bee n used  
in patients with diastolic dysfunction -induced  atrial fibrillation and HF pEF. This 
results in a symptomatic relief and significant reduction s in the heart failure  blood 
marker BNP (7,8). In our own clinical experience, cilostazol reduce s HFpEF 
symptoms and lowers NTproBNP by [CONTACT_2902] 25% to suggest a clinical benefit  that is 
in line with the cilostazol -induced changes in BNP in patients with atrial 
fibrillation (7,8) . No adverse effects were noted in our own HFpEF patients that 
chronically t ake cilostazol .

4.2 Cilostazol Adverse Effects  
 
For cilostazol’s relationship to milrinone (PDE3 inhibitor inotrope) a theoretical 
concern was raised that cilostazol may increase the risk for sudden death  or may 
worsen congestive heart failure with reduced ejection fraction  as detailed below:  
However, in the studies that led to FDA approval in 1999, cilostazol was 
determined  to have a   good safety profile. In a randomized study of 1,439 
patients that included recovered ejection fraction heart failure patients , the 36 
months cumulative mortality rates were 6.8% in the placebo group and 5.6% in 
the cilostazol group, a non -significant difference. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_141146] , a precautionary safety warning for patients with reduced ejection 
fraction congestive heart failure was included  in the drug label . Nevertheless,

PROTOCOL TITLE: Cilostazol for HFpEF   
VERSION DATE: 05.16.2020  
 Page 10 of 24 Template Revised On: 09/01/2019  cilostazol is sometime used as a modestly effective  inotrope (agent that increases 
cardiac contractility)  in end-stage heart failure with a reduced ejection fraction .   
The most common cilostazol adverse effect is  a headache (+ 20% over placebo) , 
abdominal symptoms and diarrhea ( +12% over placebo)  and palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814] ( +9% 
over placebo) . 
 
The aforementioned m ilrinone, which is more potent than cilostazol , was recently 
reported  to improve HFpEF . In the US, m ilrinone is only approved as an  
intravenous agent (9). Similarly , levosimendan was recently reported to provide 
hemodynamic and symptomatic benefit s (10).   
The package insert includes the risk of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction, 
any type of heart failure, bleeding dyscrasias, blood dyscrasias and drug 
interactions

Individual or group that is disadvantaged in the distribution of social goods and

during the study and follow -up procedures. The sponsor provides training for 
research staff on this study protocol. This training, extensive knowledge of the 
protocol along with investigator and research staff experience aid in minimizin g 
risks to subjects . 
10.0 Local Number of Participants  
10.1 Local Number of Participants to be Consented:  25  
11.0 Local Recruitment Methods  
11.1 Recruitment Process: Potential patients determined to be possible candidates will 
be approached in the clinic and/or Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. The environment will be conducive to 
discussion as the patient will be seen privately in a clinic exam room, or in a 
private exam room. Distractions are kept to a minimum. The visit will occur in a 
relaxed and open atmosphere conducive for private conversation.  
Subjects will be given time to think over whether or not they want to participate 
in the study. Subjects are free to discuss their options with their primary care or 
physician and their family members before making their decision.  
11.2 Identifica tion of Potential Participants: Potential subjects will be recruited based 
on information contained in private/ protected records (medical records, student 
records). This also includes subjects who will be recruited from the PI [INVESTIGATOR_12749] -I’s 
patient population. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_7706] -Investigators have legitimate access to records 
per their employment with UMP heart and Fairview  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600]/clinics. Research 
staff checks for opt -outs and does not review records if the patient has opted out.  
Research team members have legitimate access to records by [CONTACT_141166]. Study team members, such as coordinators, are allocated  this 
authority per the Delegation of Authority log. Please note, all involved research 
staff member have undergone required PHI and Human Subjects training for the

provider in the cardiology clinic or on the cardiology service will briefly tell the 
patient about  the study and ask if they would like to discuss it further with a 
member of the research staff (one of the investigators or coordinators). If the 
patient agrees, a member of the study staff will meet with the patient and dis cuss 
the study in more detail.  
Potential subjects will come from the UMP Cardiology Clinic/Cardiology 
Inpatient/Outpatient service where the cardiology provider practice, PI [INVESTIGATOR_7706] -
Investigators cli nically manage these patients.  
Private/protected records will include MEDICAL records. Research staff will 
ensure the patient has not opted out of research on the Consent for T reatment

N/A 
14.0 Potential Benefits to Participants  
14.1 Potential Benefits:  
moderate  chance (>30%) at improving heart failure symptoms within 48h after 
first dose of  cilostazol  
 
15.0 Statistical Considerations  
15.1 Data Analysis Plan:  
Primary outcomes  
 
KCCQ  heart failure questionnaire:  paired parametric test (t -test) of placebo average 
composite score and the cilostazo l average composite score.  
 
NTproBNP:  Relative change s in NTproBNP level ( placebo versus cilostazol) will be 
compared by [CONTACT_141168] (t-test) . 
 
15.2 Power Analysis:  
In a recent large HFpEF clinical trial of sacubitril/valsartan  the baseline KCCQ score was 
71 ± 19 . A sample size of 18 would provide us with 80%  power  to detect a 25 % relative  
difference using a [ADDRESS_160275]. We propose a sample size of 25 participants to ascertain 
18 or greater completed studies. In a recently completed pacemaker  study that leads 
to a similar increase in heart rate we found a beneficial outcome in a heart failure 
questionnaire in n=22 participants (see reference #4, Wahlberg et al.).   
 
15.3 Statistical Analysis:  
Linear mixed -effect models determine the effect of cilostazol on the primary outcome, 
accounting for inter -patient differences and treatment assignment and sequences. For 
the primary endpoint, the KCCQ total score at the end of each week (week  1 to 4) is the 
dependent variable, while the treatment (cilostazol versus placebo) is the independent 
variable. Patient identifier and treatment sequence (binary variable marking the start 
of the treatment with placebo or cilostazol) are entered as ran dom effects. The same 
approach was taken to assess the effect of cilostazol on NT -proBNP levels, after log -
transforming NT -proBNP values given their skewed distribution. To determine the

discussion. Continued consent is accessed at each follow -up visit to ensure 
subject understanding and continued willingness to participate.  
Documentation is comprised of a note in the subject file. The free text note

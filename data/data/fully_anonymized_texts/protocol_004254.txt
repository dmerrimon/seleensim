 1. Introduction  
This statistical analysis plan (SAP) is based on the S MILEE  study ( IND Number: 
[ZIP_CODE] ) protocol  version 7.0, dated April  27, 201 7. The SAP summarizes key aspects of 
the study to provide the context of statistical methods for analyzing the data and the 
descriptive measures t o be reported.  
2. Study  Overview  
The SMILEE  study is a Phase II A double -blind, placebo -controlled randomized  trial. 
This section describes the design, objectives, endpoints , and treatments of this study 
as well as the study population and randomization.  
2.1 Study  Design  
This is a double -blind, placebo -controlled, randomized trial to study the efficacy and 
safety of Viaskin® Milk, an allergen extract of milk administered epi[INVESTIGATOR_464392]® epi[INVESTIGATOR_464393] 4 to 17 years o ld with a 
milk induced Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE) . The trial will be conducted at The 
Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6684] (CHOP). The first four patients will be [ADDRESS_595075] milk -free diet will be considered for participation in the 
SMILEE study. A screening/standard of care  (SOC)  upper endoscopy and bio psy will 
be performed after introduction of milk (minimum of 30 ml/day for 1 week to 2 
months). If the endoscopy shows greater than or equal to 15 eosinophils per high 
power field (HPF), it will confirm the diagnosis of EoE. In addition, m ilk will be 
remov ed from the diet and a SOC upper endoscopy and biopsy will be performed 
2 | P a g e  
 after a minimum of 6 weeks under a milk -free diet to confirm the diagnosis of milk -
induced EoE. If the biopsy after milk elimination shows 0 to 10 eosinophils per HPF, 
the subjects wil l be eligible for participation in the study, and will be randomized in 
a 3:1 ratio into two different treatment groups, to receive epi[INVESTIGATOR_464394] (EPIT ) with Viaskin® Milk (500 µg of milk proteins) or placebo.  If a 
subject has  a SOC endoscopy  in [ADDRESS_595076] upper endoscopy, all subjects will 
continue treatment with open -label Viaskin® Milk (500 µg of milk proteins).  Subjects 
with ≥15 eosinophils/hpf on the 3rd upper endoscopy will restart milk -free diet for [ADDRESS_595077] with < 15 eosinophils/hpf on the 3rd upper endoscopy, they will continue on 
milk for up to 11 additional months (if symptoms re -appear, milk -free diet should 
restart) while on treatment with active therapy, at which time a 4th upper endoscopy 
will be done.  A final follow -up visit will be done [ADDRESS_595078] endoscopy.  
In total, during this study, e ligible subjects will be required to attend 1 7 study visits.  
In addition to the endoscopy and biopsy, subjects will undergo other efficacy 
parameter assessments at months 1, 3, 6, 9 , 11, 14, 17, 20,  and 22. Key assessments of 
3 | P a g e  
 safety will be performed at e ach study visit , including vital signs, physical 
examinations and laboratory assessments. In between visits, subjects will report safety 
data on the diary card s.  
2.2 Study  objectives  and endpoint s 
The primary  and secondary  efficacy objectives and safety objec tives as well as 
endpoint s of this study are as follows:  
2.2.1 Primary efficacy objective  
The main efficacy objective is to assess  the efficacy of Viaskin® Milk EPIT to 
desensitize milk -induced EoE  in subjects at the end of the double -blind treatment 
period. The  study will analyze the maximum esophageal eosinophil count on all 
specimens obtained at the end of the double -blind treatment period in esophageal 
biopsy after milk reintroduction in subjects with EoE. This is the gold -standard for the 
diagnosis of EoE.  
2.2.2 Primary efficacy endpoint  
The primary efficacy endpoint  is each patient’s maximum esophageal eosinophil 
count on all specimens obtained from  the biopsy at the end of double -blind treatment 
(visit 10) , after milk reintroduction at visit 9.  
2.2.3 Secondary efficacy  objective s    
The secondary efficacy objectives are:  
a. To describe the EoE symptoms score and global assessment score at end of each 
treatment period at 11 months (end of the double -blind treatment)  and 22 months 
(end of the open -label treatment) in each tr eatment group  and to  determine if there 
4 | P a g e  
 is a difference in improvement  of the EoE symptom score  between the active 
treatment group and the placebo group.  
b. To assess  if there is a difference in the m ean esophageal eosinophil count  between 
the active treatmen t group and the placebo group  at end of each treatment  period 
at 11 and 22 months . 
c. To assess if the change s in mean and maximum esophageal eosinophil count from 
baseline to end of each treatment period at 11 and 22 months are different between 
the active t reatment group and the placebo group.  
d. To assess  if the percentages of subjects with ≤  1 eosinophils/HPF (excellent 
response), subjects with 2 -14 eosinophils/HPF (good response), and subjects with 
≥ 15 eosinophils/HPF (poor response) at the end of each treatment  period at 11 and 
22 months  are similar between the active treatment group and the placebo group . 
e. To assess  if there is a difference in e sophageal endoscopy score at the end of each 
treatment  period at 11 and 22 months  and t o examine the change s in esophageal 
endoscopy score from baseline to the end of each treatment  period at 11 and 22 
months  between the active treatment group and the placebo group . 
f. To examine the c hange s in the eosinophilic esophagitis quality of life score from 
baseline to the end of each treatment  period at 11 and 22 months  between the 
active treatment group and the placebo group . 
g. To examine the changes in the composite score , which will be calculated using four 
measures (Eosinophils/HPF, Esophageal Endoscopic Reference Score (E REFS), 
Pediatric Eosinophilic Esophagitis Symptoms Score (PEESS) , and  investigator 
assessment of EoE symptom activity), from baseline to the end of treatment period 
at 11 and 22 months between the active treatment group and the placebo group  
[Composite score = Maximum Eosinophils per HPF + 10*EREFS + 2*PEESS +5*  
(Investigator assessment of EoE symptom activity) ]. 
5 | P a g e  
 h. To assess  if there is difference in time to development symptoms after milk 
reintroduction at month 9  and 20  between the active treatment group and t he 
placebo group . 
i. To assess the changes in exploratory biologic markers including T -regulatory cells, 
thymic stromal lymphopoietin ( TSLP ), and complete blood count ( CBC ) with 
differential and milk -specific Immunoglobulin level and epi[INVESTIGATOR_464395] n the active treatment group and the placebo group.  
2.2.4 Secondary efficacy endpoint s 
The secondary efficacy endpoint  measures are :  
a. The EoE symptom score  and global assessment score  at the end of each  treatment 
period at 11 and 22 months (improvement in EoE sy mptom score will be defined 
as a decrease in total symptom score of two or more from baseline to the end of 
each treatment  period at 11 and 22 months ) as well as the change in EoE symptom 
score from baseline to the end of each treatment  period at 11 and 22  months  (e.g., 
the change in EoE symptom score at 11 month = the EoE symptom score at 11 
month – (minus) the EoE symptom score at baseline , the change score is the 
difference)  and the EoE frequency and severity symptom scores measured by 
[CONTACT_464403] (PEESS) at the end of each 
treatment  period at 11 and 22 months  as well as the changes in these symptom 
scores from baseline to the end of  each  treatment  period at 11 and 22 months . 
b. Mean esophageal eosinophil count which is the average of all of the samples 
obtained on biopsy at the end of each treatment  period at 11 and 22 months .  
c. The changes in mean and maximum esophageal eosinophil count from baseline to 
the end of each treatment  period at 11 and 22 months . 
d. The p ercentage s of subjects with ≤ 1 eosinophil/HPF  (excellent response), subjects 
with 2 -14 eosinophils/HPF (good response) , and subjects with ≥ 15 
6 | P a g e  
 eosinophils/HPF (poor response) at the end of each treatment  period at 11 and 22 
months . 
e. Esophageal endoscopy score at the end of each treat ment  period at 11 and 22 
months  and the c hange in the esophageal endoscopy score from baseline to the 
end of each treatment  period at 11 and 22 months . 
f. Change s in the eosinophilic esophagitis quality of life score from baseline to the 
end of each treatment  period at 11 and 22 months . 
g. Change s in the composite score from baseline to the end of each treatment period 
at 11 and 22 months.  
h. Time to development symptoms after milk reintroduction at month 9  and 20 . 
i. Changes in exploratory biologic markers, including T-regulatory cells, TSLP , 
and CBC  with differential and milk -specific Immunoglobulin level  and 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_14364] . 
2.2.5 Safety objective s    
The safety objectives are t o evaluate the safety of Viaskin® Milk EPIT  treatment in 
children and adolescents with milk -induced EoE.  Adverse events ( AEs) and Serious 
Adverse Events ( SAEs ) by [CONTACT_9313], severity, and relatedness to Viaskin® 
Milk, duration of local skin reactions induced by [CONTACT_464404]® Milk, use of medications to 
treat AEs, systemic allergic symptoms and  relatedness to Viaskin® Milk, changes in 
laboratory results, physical exams and vital signs will be assessed . 
2.2.6 Safety endpoints   
The safety endpoints  are: 
a. Local skin tolerance: incidence, severity and duration of local Treatment -Emergent 
Adverse Event (TEA E) at site of Viaskin® application as reported by [CONTACT_464405].  
7 | P a g e  
 b. Potentially drug -related TEAEs.  
c. Discontinuation due to TEAEs.  
d. Laboratory data, physical examinations, and vital signs .  
e. Systemic allergic symptoms  and relatedness to Viaskin®. 
f. Potentially drug -related systemic allergic symptoms . 
g. SAEs. 
2.3 Treatments  
Subjects will be randomized to receive Viaskin® with milk p rotein (500 μg of milk 
proteins ) or placebo  during the first year in the study . Viaskin® milk contains a dry 
deposit of natural m ilk protein formulated without adjuvant. The placebo treatment 
will consist of a similar formulation, but will be devoid of milk proteins. During the 
second year in the study (after third upper endoscopy), all subjects will receive open -
label Viaskin® (500 µg of milk proteins).  
2.4 Procedures  
Study subjects, randomization, replacements of the withdrawn subjects , and duration 
of the study are described.  
2.4.1 Study Population  
Pediatric subjects, aged 4 to 17 years, with milk induced Eosinophilic Esophagitis will 
be en rolled and randomized following confirmation of all eligibility criteria.   
Inclusion Criteria:  
1. Well documented symptoms suggestive of EoE after ingestion of mi lk and  
currently following a strict milk -free diet . 
8 | P a g e  
 2. Upper endoscopy and biopsy at clinical evalua tion during screening  showing 
greater than or equal to [ADDRESS_595079]’s diet 
(30 ml/day for 1 week to 2 months), while the subject was o n a proton pump 
inhibitor . 
3. Upper endoscopy and biopsy at clinical evaluation during screening  showing [ADDRESS_595080] use effective methods of contraception to prevent 
pregnancy and agree to continue to practice an acceptable method of 
contraception for the duration of participation in the study.   
2.4.2 Randomization and replacement  
Approximately 2 2 eligible subjects to obtain 18 completed subjects will be randomized 
in a 3:1 ratio into two different treatment groups, (1) to receive EPIT with Viaskin® 
Milk (500 μg  of milk proteins)  or (2) placebo (1 6 subjects in the active Viaskin® Milk 
group and 6 subjects in the placebo group). Subjects who are withdrawn after 
beginning the treatment phase of the study will not be replaced. However, sufficient 
subjects will be in cluded to ensure the minimum sample size.  
2.4.3 Study duration   
The planned duration of the clinical study is approximately 3 years  (Start -up + Screening 
period + Treatment period + Closeout). Subject participation will be approximately 2 
years (including up to 3 months and 2 weeks for the screening period ; 11 months for the 
treatment period ; 11 months for open label extension; and a 2-week follow -up visit). 
Recruitment into the study will stop when approximately [ADDRESS_595081] been 
9 | P a g e  
 randomized to treatment. The  study will be stopped when the last subject receiving the 
double -blind treatment completes the study or when the last ongoing subject has 
discontinued treatment, whichever occurs first.  
2.[ADDRESS_595082] three visits during the screening per iod that will occur before 
enrollment and randomization to the active treatment phase of the SMILEE study. 
Fully eligible subjects will be required to attend 1 7 study visits as follows:  
Screening period: Potentially eligible subjects will be enrolled into the study (Visit 1) 
to confirm Treatment Period study eligibility and obtain a number of study endpoints.  
The GI group will follow SOC  procedures, but the dates of the first (Visit 2) and 
second (Visit 3) endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_464396], but by [CONTACT_464406]. The second upper endoscopy/biopsy will 
be done at a minimum of 6 weeks after milk -removal, per clinical care. If a patient 
meets eligibility criteria for the Treatment Period of SMILEE, s/he wi ll be referred to 
the Allergy/Immunology division for continuation in the study. If the results of the 
first or second endoscopy with biopsies confirm ineligibility, the subject may  be 
considered as screen failed  and may  not continue in the study.   
Visit 1: Informed Consent obtained : milk introduction.  
Visit 2: One week to [ADDRESS_595083] a SOC  upper 
endoscopy/ biopsy  performed to confirm the diagnosis of EoE . Milk is removed from 
the diet.

EoE performed after a minimum of [ADDRESS_595084]  has an endoscop y that confirm s milk responsive EoE in the preceding 12 
months, they will not need a repeat endoscopy to be eligible  for the study.  
10 | P a g e  
 Treatment period: There will be seven visits during the treatment period :  
Visit 4 (Day 1): This visit c orresponds  to the first day of treatment and can be 
performed as soon as the results of the upper endoscopy and biopsy at Visit 3 are 
available and there is confirmed eligibility into the study.  
Visit 5: This corresponds to day 8 of treatment.  
Visit 6 : This corresponds to month 1 of treatment.  
Visit 7 : This corresponds to month 3 of treatment.

3. Statistical Considerations  
This section provides a detailed  description of the statistical design, study objectives, 
and sample size determination and power calculation.  
3.1 Statistical design  
This is a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled clinical trial with Viaskin® 
Milk as Treatment 1 and placebo as Treatm ent 2. Primary and secondary efficacy 
objectives as well as the safety objectives are presented in Section 2.2 .  
3.2 Sample size determination and power calculation  
The primary objective of this study is to  determine whether mean maximum 
eosinophil counts is d ifferent in the subjects on the Viaskin Milk group compared to 
those on the placebo group. This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_464397]® Milk treatment. Sample size is based on projected subject volume. If 
efficacy is shown, ou r pi[INVESTIGATOR_464398] a power analysis for a larger 
study. We will recruit [ADDRESS_595087] 2 2 evaluable subjects with milk -
induced EoE confirmed by [CONTACT_464407]. Approximately 2 0 subjects (1 5 
subjects in the active Vias kin® Milk group and 5 subjects in the placebo group) will be 
randomized to two treatment groups to obtain 18 completed subjects assuming 1 0% 
dropout rate. This sample size will have 90% power to detect a difference of 40 in 
mean maximum eosinophil counts b etween the subjects receiving Viaskin® milk 
(mean maximum eosinophil count of 10) and the subjects on placebo (mean maximum 
12 | P a g e  
 eosinophil count of 50) assuming a common standard deviation of [ADDRESS_595088] be made by [CONTACT_160717]. The primary 
analysis can be performed on data without imputation. However, exploratory analyses 
using various imputation techniques (i.e., last observation carried f orward  (LOCF) ) will 
be utilized to assess the robustness of the data. Analyses of secondary efficacy measures 
will be based on the intent -to-treat (ITT) population with missing values imputed using 
the last value carried forward analysis . 
4. Statistical Analy ses 
This section provides a detailed description of the statistical analyses and methods, 
tables, listing s, and figures. SAP Table shells are presented in Section 5.1.  
The definitions of the analysis populations are listed.  The general description of the 
planned analysis is provided. D escriptive and baseline characteristics will be 
generated for the purpose of describing the study population . Because the sample size 
is small, sometimes the most informative way of presenting the data will be through 
graphs or listing of the raw data.   
The primary and secondary efficacy endpoints will be analyzed using the intent -to-
treat (ITT) a nd per protocol populations. The least squares mean and two-sided 95% 
confidence interval (CI) for the between -treatment differences  will be estimated from 
the models. The Hodges -Lehmann analysis of median differences will be produced 
for some of the secondary  efficacy endpoints.  Relative risk (RR) or odds ratio (OR) 
with 95% CI will be presented  for some of the binary endpoints.  Longi tudinal models 
will be used to analyze some of the efficacy endpoints. These models will focus on the 
difference between baseline and end of the double -blind treatment as well as end of 
13 | P a g e  
 the open -label treatment; measurements taken before the end of the dou ble-blinded 
treatment will be used to increase the precision of the estimates of the changes from 
baseline to the both end of the double -blind treatment and the end of the open -label 
treatment. Sensitivity analyses w ill be performed to examine the potentia l outliers and 
influential points.  These measurements will be  assessed by [CONTACT_464408] s. The methods 
or statistical tests that will be used in the primary and secondary efficacy a nalys es and 
safety analys es are described. Details are provided below.  
4.1 Analysis populations  
The analysis populations are:  
 Safety population:  The safety population is comprised of all subjects who are 
randomized and received at least one dose of study treat ment  and all subjects in 
the control group who did not withdraw or were not withdrawn . This population 
will be used to assess comparative safety information.  
 Intent -to-treat  population:  The intent -to-treat ( ITT) population (full analysis set) 
is comprised of all subjects who are randomized. Subjects in the ITT population 
will be categorized by [CONTACT_464409]. This population 
will be used to assess comparative efficacy information.  
 Per protocol population:  The per protocol (PP) populat ion includes all subjects in 
the ITT population who do not have pre -defined major deviations from the 
protocol that may affect the primary (and secondary) endpoints (i.e., subjects who 
have not gone through the third upper endoscopy and biopsy at the end o f the 
double -blind treatment, subjects with a compliance below 80% , etc.). The PP 
population will be used to perform confirmatory analyses of the primary efficacy 
evaluation.  
14 | P a g e  
 4.[ADDRESS_595089] descriptive statistics will be used to describe sub jects’ baseline 
characteristics and study endpoint  measures overall and within each treatment group. 
Summary statistics such as  means, standard deviations, medians,  interquartile range  
and ranges for continu ous variables  (e.g., age, height, weight, and max imum 
esophageal eosinophil count ) and f requency counts and percentage s for categorical 
variables  (e.g., race and ethnicity)  will be generated . Medical histories will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_6657].   
Demographic characteristics  (Table 1), medical history ( Table 2 ), vital signs  at baseline 
(day 1) , end of the double -blind  treatment  (visit 10) , and end of the open -label 
treatment  (visit 1 6) (Table 3), and both hematology and chemistry laboratory test 
results  at baseline , end of the double-blind treatment, and end of the open -label 
treatment  (Table 4A and Table 4B) will be summarized. Transformation (e.g ., 
logarithmic transformation) of some of the continuous variables will be applied if 
needed.  
4.[ADDRESS_595090] disposition w ill be summarized for the ITT population. Subjects in each study 
population (ITT, PP, and Safety), subjects who received study medication, and 
subjects who completed and discontinued the double -blind period  as well as the 
open -label period  will be summariz ed (e.g., frequency counts and percentages) by 
[CONTACT_464410] ( Table 5). The p rimary reason for discontinuation from 
the double -blind period and the open -label period will be listed by [CONTACT_6660].  
4.4 Efficacy analyses  
The methods for the primary and secondary efficacy analyses are described.  
15 | P a g e  
 4.4.1 Primary efficacy analys es 
Descriptive statistics for the maximum esophageal eosinophil count (the primary 
efficacy endpoint) on all specimens obtained on the biopsy at baseline  (Day 1)  and 
end of trea tment (Visit 10) as well as the change from baseline to end of treatment will 
be presented by [CONTACT_464411] (4 -11 years old and 12 -17 years old) 
(Table 6). The primary efficacy endpoint of the maximum esophageal eosinophil count 
will be analyzed  using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model s with the 
treatment group  (active versus placebo)  and baseline patient’s maximum esophageal 
eosinophil count . The least square means for the treatment groups, difference in least 
square means between the treatment groups, and a two-sided 95% CI for the 
difference between treatment groups will be presented ( Table 7). Analysis of the 
primary endpoint in the logarithmic scale will be considered.  Geometric mean  and 
geometric mean ratio  (anti-log of the parameter estimates ) with 95% CIs will be 
reported  when analyses are performed in the logarithmic scale of the primary 
endpoint.  
4.4.2 Secondary efficacy analys es 
Descriptive statistics for the secondary efficacy endpoints will be presented by 
[CONTACT_6660] . The following secondary efficacy endpoints will be assessed:  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Total esophageal endoscopy score  
The total score for each subject will be calculated and summary  statistics at baseline , 
end of the double -blind  treatment , and end of the open -label treatment  as well as the 
change s from baseline to end of the double -blind treatment and to end of the open -
label treatment will be presented by [CONTACT_6660] ( Table 8). Hodges -Lehmann 
estimate  with 95% CI  for difference of median  of the change s in esophageal endoscopy 
16 | P a g e

 3.0 Significance  
Research shows  that evidence based cessation treatments such as telephone counseling and 
FDA-approved smoking cessation medications are effective; they increase abstinence rates 
significantly if smokers use them for a quit attempt. However, an important impediment to th eir 
population impact is that only a relatively small percentage of smokers participate in such 
treatments when offered (that is, smoking cessation treatments have low ‘reach’ in healthcare 
populations). Specifically, when offered smoking treatment perhaps  only 20% or so of smokers 
agree to treatment referral, and then perhaps only 5 -10% actually enter such treatment1,2.  
Previous research shows that providing financial incentives for participating in smoking 
cessation interventions increase s both  treatment  participation and abstinence rates3-6.  
However, much of that research was conducted in Medicaid populations and did not occur in a 
healthcare setting and with a patient population. Moreover, some of this research used large 
incentives for treatment engag ement (e.g., Baker et al., 2018; Fraser et al., 2017 , Volpp et al., 
2016 )4,5,[ADDRESS_1140370]  incentives offered to all smokers in a healthcare system will  
increase both participation in smoking cessation treatment and resulting abstinence  rates . The 
incentive program will i nvolve an ‘engagement incentive’ that is intended to increase patients’ 
engagement in smoking treatment when it is offered by [CONTACT_822413] ( TCOS ).  Further, in an effort to increase the reach of smoking treatment, all smokers 
listed on the healthcare system ’s smoker registry will be alerted about the availability of 
incentives  during routine TCOS telephone outreach provided as standard practice 1) within 2 
weeks of each primary care encounter (‘recent visit call’ and 2) at least  annually to those without 
a primary care or TCOS encounter in the prior year  (‘annual call’) ; thus, the offer of treatment 
will not depend on smokers’ making a healthcare visit.  If successful, this incentive -based reach 
program  could be disseminated  to reduce the considerable financial and personal costs 
associated with smoking -related disease.  
 
4.0 Goals/Aims  
4.[ADDRESS_1140371] Group Health Cooperative (GHC -
SCW) patients who smoke.  All members of the GHC -SCW  Cigarette Users Registry ( i.e., 
individuals who the health system believes are smokers, the ‘Registry’) at the time of 
implementation will be eligible to participate.  Smokers who speak with  the TCOS staff when 
called for standa rd care management outreach following a   recent  primary care visit or during an 
annual outreach call and listen to the description of smoking treatments will be randomized to 
receive one of three  incentive amounts ($0, $ 100, & $50) for continuing treatment planning , 
establishing a target quit date  and completing two telephone counseling sessions . Particip ants 
will be told about the size of their incentive, which in theory will increase their likelihood of 
engaging in smoking treatment and therefore, quitting smoking successfully.  For the non -$0 
incentive groups, ½ the total value will  be apportioned for c ompletion of each a Pre -quit

4.2 Aims  
Primary Aim  
1. To determine the relations between treatment engagement financial incentive amounts 
offered and likelihood of patient engagement in smoking cessation treatment.   
a. Primary outcome  measure : Patient engagement in smoking cessation treatment  
(defined as settin g a TQD and completing the two phone counseling calls).  
Exploratory  Aims  
1. To determine the incremental cost -effectiveness of the different financial engagement 
incentive amounts with regard to total program costs vs. usual care, net monetary benefit 
(NMB), cost per quit, and incremental cost -effectiveness ratios (ICERs), with the last 
determined with regard to cost of additional smoker recruited and each additional individual 
who quits smoking.  
2. To determine the representativeness of smoking treatment reach and smoking abstinence 
outcomes generated by [CONTACT_822414]: e.g., those low in socio -economic status, priority populations, different 
racial and ethnic groups.  
3. Conduct exploratory analyses on the effects of  the different incentive engagement amounts 
on biochemically confirmed point -prevalence [ADDRESS_1140373] s abstinence via effects on smoking treatment engagement (i.e., 
whether sm oking treatment engagement mediates the relations between different 
engagement incentive conditions and 6 -month smoking abstinence).   
 
 
5.[ADDRESS_1140374] from  their GHC -SCW  TCOS to discuss tobacco use treatment options will be reminded 
of GHC -SCW ’s commitment to helpi[INVESTIGATOR_822403], advised to quit smoking, 
offered support to quit smoking, recruited, screened, consented, and randomized over the 
phone to one of three  conditions of financial engagement incentives ($0, $ 100, $50).  Smok ers 
unwilling to participate in the incentivized treatment program will be offered entry into the 
existing GHC -SCW  standard smoking cessation program.  Patients participating in the research 
study  will also receive smoking treatment via the existing GHC -SCW standard smoking 
cessation program. Participants in the research study  will be told that they may receive a 
[Incentives for Smoking Treatment Study ]  [Fiore ] 
  
7 
 treatment engagement incentive, with the amount consistent with their randomized incentive 
condition; receipt of their assigned incentive amount i s dependent upon their setting a quit date 
and completing two smoking cessation treatment  counseling contact s. The smoking cessation 
treatment includes medication and [ADDRESS_1140375] smoking cessation program available to all GHC -
SCW  patients. This program entails a brief counseling call a week (typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] 5 -7 days) Pre-quit, 
i.e. before the patient’s target quit date (TQD), approximately 5-7 days following the TQD  (Week 
1), and about one month following the TQD  (Week 4) .  Research participants will be asked to 
complete brief (3 to 5 minute) assessments during each standard care smoking treatment 
counseling call by G HC-SCW, plus [ADDRESS_1140376] -TQD 
phone interview will be asked to return to their primary care clinic to complete breath, urine, 
and/or saliva testing to verify a bstinence from combustible tobacco. This will entail providing 
breath samples for carbon monoxide testing and/or a urine or saliva sample for immediate 
cotinine testing (no samples will be stored). Participants may also be asked to collect a saliva 
sample at home and return it in the mail if they do not attend a biochemical verification visit.

assignment, advise all patients who smoke to quit, let them know that s/he can offer help in 
quitting, and ask if patients are interested in quitting within the next 30 days.  If the patient is 
assigned to either the $ 100 or $50 incentive , the TCOS will inform the patient that they can earn 
that incentive for setting a quit plan within the  next 30 days and completing two smoking 
treatment counseling call s. If patients are in the $0 incentive condition they will be offered the 
opportunity to  enter the smoking cessation treatment program with no offer of a financial 
incentive for treatment engagement , which is consistent with usual care. If patients agree to 
receive smoking treatment, they will be asked brief screening questions .

 6.2 Inclusion /Exclusion  criteria  
Inclusion  criteria  
• Age > 17 years.  
• On Cigarette User Registry at a participating clinic  
• Able to speak English or Spanish  
Exclusion criteria Activated healthcare power of attorney or cognitive impairment that would 
preclude informed consent.  
• Existing target quit date 30 days from date of call to TCOS  
• Current billable insurance status in EHR of Medicare or non -BadgerCare Medicaid  
• Prior screening for Treatment Engagement  incentive enrollment  
Those who agree to and pass screening for the inclusion/exclusion criteria for study 
participation will be asked to complete an oral consent and HIPAA authorization process. Those 
who decline th e screening invitation, do not meet eligibility criteria, or do not provide oral 
consent for study participation will be advised to quit smoking and offered standard smoking 
cessation treatment.  
Those who consent to the study will then be asked to complete  a baseline assessment and will 
set a quit date with TCOS, which will determine the times of the therapy contacts offered as part 
of the GHC -SCW  standard smoking cessation treatment.  
6.3 Vulnerable Populations  
Because we seek to evaluate interventions that  will promote use of evidence -based treatment, 
and thereby [CONTACT_533633], from the full range of adult daily smokers who receive 
healthcare services from the GHC -SCW  healthcare system, we will not exclude members of 
vulnerable populations, includ ing pregnant women (for whom quitting smoking is an important 
goal for the health of both mother and child) or those on parole or probation (this will not be 
assessed, as it is not directly relevant to the study and does not materially alter the risk to 
benefit ratio of participation). Individuals who are in institutional living situations (e.g., in assisted 
living facilities) will also be eligible, if they are adults, smoke daily, are enrolled at a GHC -SCW  
primary care clinic, and are considered competent to make healthcare decisions according to 
existing healthcare system protocols and procedures. TCOS will be trained to check this 
information and to seek only oral consent from those capable of providing s uch consent. 
Excluding members of these vulnerable populations is not warranted for their protection and 
would instead unjustly prevent their involvement in a minimal -risk program offering benefit 
(information about the opportunity to connect with evidence -based smoking treatment at no 
personal cost, apart from telephone charges where applicable  and standard GHC -SCW 
smoking cessation clinical treatment ). In addition, while the study does not target incarcerated 
individuals, some participants may be incarcer ated during the period of study involvement. All 
study outreach, treatment provision, and assessment will be suspended during a participant’s 
period of incarceration.  
[Incentives for Smoking Treatment Study ]  [Fiore ] 
  
9 
 None of these vulnerable populations will be specifically targeted in recruitment. The pr oposed 
reach interventions, assessments, and compensation schedule should pose no more risk for 
pregnant women, those on parole or probation, or those in institutionalized settings than for the 
general population, as study procedures confer minimal risk, a re informational in nature, and are 
entirely voluntary. As part of the normal delivery of the GHC -SCW  smoking treatment program, 
if a patient has contraindications to the use of smoking medication  (e.g., pregnancy) , that patient 
will not be offered such me dication as part of their treatment.  
In addition to the engagement incentives, $20 for completing a telephone survey 6 months after 
their original Target Quit Date and $[ADDRESS_1140379] -enrollme nt visit for biochemical validation of abstinence from smoking . This 
payment for completing this important research assessment will be  available to all enrolled 
participants, regardless of assigned experimental condition.  
6.4 Consent  & Enrollment  
GHC -SCW  TCOS  staff will be responsible for program implementation and data documentation 
(using existing EHR and administrative data fields)  except for 3- and [ADDRESS_1140380] practice but 
declined study participation .   
All patients who agree to the study offer  – tailored to their assigned Treatment Engagement 
Incentive value ( Attachment B: Invite script),  and pass the inclusion and exclusion criteria for 
Treatment Engagement Incentive study participation will be read an oral consent script by a 
healthcare system TCOS (see uploaded Recruitment Call script). The consent script re ad to 
participants over the phone conveys the key points regarding study procedures; risks; and 
participant rights, protections, and benefits , and does so in accessible  language (assessed for 
reading level). The consent will inform patients that some monet ary payments may be offered 
as part of the study for engaging in study components, including $20 for completing a telephone 
survey 6 months after their original Target Quit Date and $[ADDRESS_1140381], 
but the [incentive] amounts available will not be disclosed (so that some patients will not refuse 
further engagement due to disappointment with their incentive amount).  Prospective 
participants will b e given an opportunity to ask questions and raise concerns during this 
process, which will be addressed prior to seeking oral consent. Informed consent for study 
participation will be formally documented electronically in the UW-ICTR REDCap instance study 
database . Following enrollment for those who consent, TCOS staff will send out a letter in hard 
copy to the participant at the address provided (see uploaded Study Information Sheet). This 
letter will remind the participant of study procedures and will inc lude a detailed study information 
enclosure containing all required elements of informed consent and HIPAA authorization.  
Those randomly assigned to either the $ 100 or $[ADDRESS_1140382] (e.g., medication copays) for all members targeted by [CONTACT_62315].   
[Incentives for Smoking Treatment Study ]  [Fiore ] 
  
10 
 Data  availabl e to researchers  on participants enrolled will include : a) data collected in the 
course of usual clinical care extracted from the EHR, b) research assessments conducted over 
the phone documented in REDCap or other research database, and c) the one -time carbon 
monoxide breath sample captured in -person using a B edfont Breathalyzer unit , or, alternatively 
urine samples collected in clinic, or saliva samples collected at home or in clinic . 
Given the remote nature of the outreach and because we want to reduce burden (e.g., travel) 
for participants, an oral consent p rocess seems in our view to be most beneficial to participants 
in this minimal  risk study. Moreover, this approach will likely protect the external validity of the 
findings by [CONTACT_822415] -world wellness and prevention intervention s. 
Collecting consent over the phone also reduces the risk that we will inadvertently bias the 
sample toward the most motivated, stable, or affluent members of the target population as might 
occur with face -to-face or mailed consent processes. Mailing a wr itten consent form and waiting 
for this to be returned would likely result in meaningfully fewer patients follow ing through and 
taking advantage of this incentivized smoking treatment opportunity than would occur with oral 
consent; this would not only redu ce patient benefit but would yield data that are less 
representative of the effects of incentive interventions in real world healthcare systems (e.g., by 
[CONTACT_46431]-selecting those who are more motivated), which could affect both treatment engagement  
rates and s uccess rates of the standard smoking treatment.   
For these reasons, we also propose to use an altered HIPAA authorization because it would be 
impracticable to obtain authorization with all elements required under the HIPAA Privacy Rule 
over the phone. We also seek to waive some of the required elements of consent and HIPAA 
authorization over the phone in order to reduce participant burden and to enhance 
comprehension of the material read to participants, without omitting any key information 
pertinent to ri sks, rights, or protections. Consent and HIPAA authorization over the phone will 
cover the collection of data from the electronic health record for research purposes. The mailed 
Study Information Sheet  that will follow the telephone enrollment and oral con sent process will 
include all required elements of consent and HIPAA authorization (including a statement 
regarding how long permission to use the PHI will last, how to withdraw permission for PHI use, 
and the mandatory statement that the PHI could be redi sclosed without subjects' permission in 
the consent/authorization and enrollment process). The Study Information Sheet also details 
how to withdraw from the study and revoke authorization to use PHI, without penalty or 
punishment. The  mailed  Study Informat ion Sheet  will provide a phone number for participants to 
call should they have questions.  
The TCOS will ask if the participant gives the study permission to stay in touch with them and 
send them reminders about upcoming study contacts during the study via  email and/or text 
message. The TCOS will remind them that email and text messaging are generally not a secure 
way to communicate about their health as there are many ways for unauthorized users to 
access email and text messages. The TCOS will also inform them that they do not have to 
provide their email address or text message number to participate in this study.  
With regard to compensation and incentives, the Consent Script and mailed Study Information 
Sheet  will make clear distinctions between compensation for completing the 6 -month follow -up 
assessment and smoking abstinence biochemical confirmation (available i n all conditions), and 
incentives for treatment engagement (available to about 2/3 of participants). This is important for 
[Incentives for Smoking Treatment Study ]  [Fiore ] 
  
[ADDRESS_1140383] been told of 
their smoking treatment options.  The TCOS will then use randomization tables developed by 
[CONTACT_77504]-CTRI to randomize potential enrollees,  blocked by [CONTACT_6903] , sex, and race , into 1 of 3 
engagement incentive conditions ($0, $ 100, or $5 0).  After randomization, patients will be 
offered smoking treatment with the incentive for treatment entry  (engagement)  to which they 
had been randomized. This offer will require the participant to agree to set a stop -smoking quit 
date within the next 30 days.  This offer will occur prior to the patient’s provision of consent  to 
participate in research . The patient must be offered the incentive up -front to see if this increases 
their treatment engagement (which necessarily  includes agreement to it/consent); offering the 
incentive after agreeing to participate in treatment would not reveal the effects of  the incentive 
on spurring engagement. Thus, we are interested in the effects of incentives on both agreement 
to enter treatment and actual likelihood of engaging in it. If a patient decides to accept the 
treatment offer, s/he will be consented and will se t a target quit date with the TCOS (within [ADDRESS_1140384] phone call). For patients who are unwilling to set a stop -smoking quit date 
within the next [ADDRESS_1140385] clinical 
protocols for tobacco use.  The experimental conditions (i.e., t he incentives) in the study are 
intended to effect smoker engagement  in treatment as offered by [CONTACT_533646].  
The primary differences between research study  participation and usual care with regard to 
smoking treatment are: 1) the consent p rocess, 2) randomization to treatment engagement 
incentive condition and provision of such incentive, 3) follow -up to determine patient smoking 
status. Importantly, actual smoking cessation treatments (counseling and medications , the 
existing GHC -SCW stand ard of care ) will be identical for both those who chose to participate in 
the study and those who do not (Figure 2) . 
 
7.[ADDRESS_1140386] incentives ($25 or $50) also improve 
attendance at primary care visits9. Thus, evidence supports modest, utilization -contingent 
incentives for use of both smoking cessation and primary care treatment. The proposed project 
[Incentives for Smoking Treatment Study ]  [Fiore ] 
  
12 
 will evaluate the effects of incentives of varying magnitude for smoking treatment engagement 
(rather than achiev ing abstinence) in primary care.  
To identify an  especially effective incentive amount, three  different incentive value conditions 
will be evaluated  (0, $100, and $50) .  The incentive will be tied to readily observable initiation  of 
treatment (i.e., setting a target quit date within [ADDRESS_1140387] phone smoking cessation 
counseling session)  and follow through  with 
treatment (i.e., engaging in the Week 4 
counseling session) . The t wo positive (non 0) 
incentive tiers were selected based on the 
results  of earlier work that used $[ADDRESS_1140388].  
 
8.0 Detailed S tudy Procedures: Recruitment  
and Assessments  
8.1 Recruitment  As noted in the enrollment flow 
diagram in Attachment A , recruitment will occur 
over the phone (in the Treatment Planning  call) 
following a patient response to standard TCOS 
outreach .  TCOS  as per their current GHC -SCW  
usual care protocol  will provide callers with 
advice to quit and an overview of cessation 
treatment options.  The TCOS will assess the 
smoker’s readiness to quit in the next 30 days as 
per usual care.  In accordance with randomiz ed 
condition , the TCOS will offer the appropri ate 
intervention incentive per the Invite Script 
(Attachment B). For those who tell the TCOS 
that they are ready to quit within [ADDRESS_1140389] care per the existing tobacco 
treatment program of the GHC-SCW  healthcare 
system (e.g., setting quit date, arranging timing of treatment contacts: See Figure 2.).   
The TCOS will be trained to present information about the Treatment Engagement  Incentive 
offer, assessing eligibility, informed consent, and researc h assessment processes  in a 
standardized manner . 
UW-CTRI personnel will be responsible for: conducting telephone follow -up interviews [ADDRESS_1140390] -TQD 
via biochemical testing (breath CO, urine, and/or saliva testing without biobanking). The Figure 2.   GHC -SCW  Healthcare System Standard

 biochemical testing visit will be conducted at UW-CTRI or a practical location of the participant ’s 
choosing.  
Personnel from both the healthcare system and UW -CTRI will therefore have contac t with study 
participants and/or their data. Coordination of all activities will be led by [CONTACT_77504] -CTRI and UW -
CTRI will perform all data analyses. All data transmissions to and from UW -CTRI will occur via 
secure, HIPAA -compliant means via capture in REDCap or SFTP or  secure  Box file transfers.  
8.2 Assessment Plan  
Baseline  assessment (See uploaded Baseline Assessment and uploaded List of EHR Data to 
Be Extracted). At enrollment, TCOS will assess tobacco use history and smoking cessation 
history, dependence, motivation and self -efficacy related to quitting smoking, attitudes  about 
and beliefs regarding smoking cessation treatments , and education . EHR data regarding age, 
sex, race, ethnicity, contact [CONTACT_3031], communication preferences, and documentation 
regarding social determinants of health (e.g., food insecurity, housin g insecurity, financial strain) 
educational attainment will be obtained. Chronic medical conditions and healthcare utilization 
over the past year will be extracted from EHR data, as well.  
Intra-treatment  assessments (See uploaded Intra -Treatment Assessment ).  At the [ADDRESS_1140394], 
counseling engagement, withdrawal, self -efficacy, and use of all nicotine/tobacco products.  
Follow -up assessments (See uploaded Follow -up Assessm ent).   UW -CTRI staff will conduct 
15-25-minute follow -up interviews [ADDRESS_1140395] 7 -day 
smoking, use of smoking cessation treatments, use of all nicotine/tobacco products, brief 
demographic characteristics, and trea tment satisfaction. Participants will receive $20 for 
participating in the 6 -month follow -up interview and $50 for attending the 6 -month biochemical 
confirmation visit at 6 months.  
To enhance follow -up interview and visit completion rates, participants wi ll be texted, mailed, 
sent MyChart message s or sent automated phone calls (depending on their communication 
preferences as noted in the EHR and during enrollment)  to remind them of follow -ups.  
Although this program will evaluate interventions delivered by  [CONTACT_533646] 
(Tobacco Cessation Outreach Specialists), follow -up data collection procedures and collation of 
data from multiple sources/sites necessary for thorough program evaluation are the 
responsibility of the UW -CTRI study investigator s. To achieve the study aims, UW -CTRI 
investigators require access to identifiable patient data on all enrolled participants. At UW -CTRI, 
all study data will be stored in a HIPAA -compliant and secure manner on Department of 
Medicine servers with UW -CTRI -controlled password access. Staff trained in human subjects 
research and HIPAA compliance will link these datasets using a random subject identifier and 
will then de -identify the data for analyses.

those on the Registry who do not participate in the research program. The data from these 
patients will be compared with the data from research participants  to assess the 
representativeness of the sample enrolled in the study .   
9.3 Planned Analysis  
Primary Aim  
• To determine the relations between treatment engagement financial incentive am ounts 
offered and likelihood of patient engagement in smoking cessation treatment (defined as 
setting a TQD and completing the two phone counseling calls (Pre-quit + Week 4 ).   
Primary a nalysis . The primary outcome measure will be  patient engagement in smoking 
cessation treatment  (defined as setting a TQD and the number of complet ed phone counseling 
contact s). We will determine the percentage of those in each incentive condition who engage in 
smoking cessation treatment. We will us e logistic regression analyses to contrast the likelihood 
of engaging in any smoking treatment  (vs none) for the three  incentive conditions  (0 incentive, 
$100, and $50), with the 0 incentive condition being the reference condition  in the primary 
analysis.  We will also examine incentive condition effects on the number of scheduled 
counseling visits completed (0 -3 visits ) via ordinal logistic regression.  
Additional exploratory analyses related to the primary aim . In additional exploratory analyses, 
we will d etermine the percentage of all GHC patients who are contact [CONTACT_822417] . We will separately determine the percentage of 
those in each incentive condition who agree to set a TQD. We will use logistic regressi on 
analyses to contrast the likelihood of engaging in  smoking treatment for the three  incentive 
conditions , with (as mentioned above) the 0 incentive condition being the reference condition  in 
the primary analysis, followed by [CONTACT_822418] $ 100 and $50 conditions  both with the 
reference condition and with one another . The primary analyses will not use covariates. Follow -
up analyses will use the patient’s home clinic and the patient’s TC OS as covariates. 
Furthermore , using logistic regression, we will examine the relation between incentive condition 
and use of pharmacotherapy as the outcome (with medication orders and pi[INVESTIGATOR_9696] -up entered in the 
EHR  and/or billing data ).  
  
Exploratory  Aims   
• Conduct exploratory analyses on the effects of the different incentive engagement 
amounts on  biochemically confirmed point -prevalence [ADDRESS_1140398] abstinence via their effects on smoking 
treatment engagement (i.e., whether smoking treatment engagement mediates the 
relations between different engagement incentive conditions and 6 -month smoking 
abstinence).   
Analysis . Logistic regression will be used to determine whether the different incentive levels ($0, 
$100, $50) produce effects on 6 -month, biochemically confirmed point prevalence smoking 
[Incentives for Smoking Treatment Study ]  [Fiore ] 
  
15 
 abstinence  using the strategy described for Primary Aim.  Dummy coding will be used to 
compare: 1) each positive incentive condition with the 0 incentive condition, and 2) the two 
positive incentive conditions will be compared with one another.  The primary analyses will not 
use covariates. Secondary models will adjust for the patient’s home clinic and the pa tient’s 
TCOS as covariates , Gender, race, cigarettes smoked/day will be added as covariates in later 
analyses. Mediational analyses will be done using incentive condition as the independent 
variable, engagement data as mediator s (attendance at the initial treatment contact, number of 
counseling contacts made, or use of smoking medication). The outcome variable will be 
smoking abstinence at 3 months (self -report only) and 6 months (biochemically confirmed self -
report).  
• To determine the incremental cost -effectiveness of the different financial engagement 
incentive amounts with regard to total program costs vs. usual care, net monetary 
benefit (NMB), cost per quit, and incremental cost -effectiveness ratios (ICERs), with the 
last determined with regard to cost of additional smoker engaged in treatment and each 
additional individual who quits smoking.  
Analysis . Cost data will come from: healthcare system costs in terms of outreach 
communications, TCOS time (related to outreach and counseling efforts), implementation costs, 
incentive costs, and medication expenditures (includ ing related physician screening when it 
occurs). We will use methods recommended by [CONTACT_822419] -Effectiveness in Health 
and Medicine10 and consistent with our prior research . We will  measure costs from a societal 
perspective using data on smoking cessation benefits from publicly available Medicare and 
Medicaid reimbursement rates.  Cost estimates will be converted to a common year and QALYs 
will be computed, using a rate of 3% to discount future outcomes and costs to present value. 
We will also conduct probabilistic sensitivity analyses to account for uncertainty. We will 
determine net monetary benefit (NMB), cost per quit (using 6 month abstinence rates), and 
incremental cost -effectiveness ratios (ICERs)11. The components of NMB will be the added 
costs of the various incentive levels and the monetized value of the QALYs added by [CONTACT_822420]. Total intervention an d implementation  costs (including outreach and added TCOS 
time for intervention, implementation, and incentives) will be compared to program costs of the 
usual care approach to tobacco use (the TCOS intervention program prior to the incentive study  
impleme ntation).  
• To determine the representativeness of smoking treatment reach and smoking 
abstinence outcomes generated by [CONTACT_822421]: e.g., those low in socio -economic status, priority 
populations, different racial and ethnic groups.  
Analysis .  We will extract data from the EHR to characterize the healthcare system population of 
patients who smoke with regard to such factors as: gender, race, ethnicity, insurance mix. Such 
person factors will be related to the likelihood that the patient:  responds to TCOS  outreach, 
agrees to accept smoking treatment (agrees to a TQD and completes a counseling call), 
completes up to 3 counseling calls, pi[INVESTIGATOR_822404], and achieves long -term 
abstinence. Logistic regression will be used to examine the likelihood that different person 
factors are significantly related to the various outcomes under the different incentive levels.  
9.4 Power  
[Incentives for Smoking Treatment Study ]  [Fiore ] 
  
[ADDRESS_1140399] a 12 percentage point difference in treatment engagement rates 
(defined as setting a TQD and completing [ADDRESS_1140400] s) as a function 
of incentive amount. We believe that this rate is both feasible and of public health significance.  
We a nticipate that the [ADDRESS_1140401] an engagement rate of about 15 %. Since 
the rate of smoking treatment engagement is generally only about 5 -7% in studies where 
incentives are not used we believe a 15% rate is conservative.  We anticipate increased  
engagement in the control condition , relative to these earlier studies,  because we believe it will 
be increased by [CONTACT_822422] a quit date on the contact [INVESTIGATOR_1306]. We 
believe that a 1 2 percentage point increase above the 15%  rate (to 27%) would be of public 
health significance. A total of [ADDRESS_1140402] p ower of .80 with 
alpha  = .[ADDRESS_1140403]. This woul d translate into a study N = 540 with 180 /condition  for 
the comparison of each positive incentive condition vs the control condition . We make no a 
priori prediction about whether the $100 incentive condition will increase engagement relative to 
the $50 condition, but we certainly believe it will increase e ngagement relative to the 0 incentive 
condition . . Therefor e, we propose an overall N=[ADDRESS_1140404] size (increment in percent abstinent) we would need to have ad equate power to 
detect difference in abstinence rates, as well .  We anticipate that the $0 incentive condition will 
produce abstinence in 1 5% of those who contact [CONTACT_822423] . With n=180/condition , we will have 
power=.[ADDRESS_1140405] an 11 percentage po int increase in abstinence above the 1 5% base 
rate in a [ADDRESS_1140406] could be from telephone charges for telephone -
delivered care such as cessation counseling and care management. Although smokers could 
access this care outside of the study, we know that only about 1 -2% of smokers use a quit line 
and only about 5% use both medication and counseling. As such, the proposed study will offer 
all participants the benefit of information about treatment options and a low -barrier method of 
initiating treatment (i.e., by [CONTACT_648] ). 
The proposed research also has the potential to benefit other smokers by [CONTACT_822424] a feasible, cost -effective, and potentially sustainable approac h in primary care settings. 
This work has the potential to accelerate the translation of clinical research on smoking 
interventions into healthcare practice and thereby [CONTACT_533665].  
To promote public access to th e results of this research, and thus its potential benefits, the 
study will be registered as a clinical trial at ClinicalTrials.gov, with information about the study 
purpose, experimental design, outcomes, and analyses available to the general public (with  
results posted within one year of study closing, as required).  
[Incentives for Smoking Treatment Study ]  [Fiore ] 
  
[ADDRESS_1140407] poses minimal risk to participants, as it entails only limited data collection solely for 
research purposes (up to [ADDRESS_1140408] (non -coercive) incentive to use standard care resources that are 
already available and consistent with FDA guidelines  
The chief risks involved are loss of privacy and breach of confidential ity. Although we will take 
several steps to protect participant privacy, we cannot guarantee that patients may not 
experience an invasion of privacy. Some patients may perceive outreach letters from the health 
system as violating privacy, for example. Like wise, we cannot guarantee the confidentiality of 
the information collected directly from participants. Although we will not collect sensitive data 
directly, some data (i.e., substance use disorder diagnoses) may be included in limited data 
extracted EHR da ta.  
The outreach message and motivational support given to participants in this project are unlikely 
to induce psychological distress, as they will be positive in tone and will focus on resources 
available to participants to support their efforts to chang e. Providing breath samples for carbon 
monoxide and/or providing saliva or urine for cotinine testing carries minimal risk, as these are 
minimally invasive procedures.  
It is important to note that all patients will have access to evidence -based smoking ce ssation 
treatment at no or low cost (through their TCOS or primary care provider , subject to limits and 
copays based on insurance coverage and/or a quit line that offers evidence -based cessation 
treatment no cost to callers) and that receiving such treatme nt is not contingent on consenting 
to this study. It is also important to note that all patients will have the ability to decline or 
withdraw from the study and any study activities at any time.

datasets) or completely de -identified prior to sharing with others outside the IRB -approved 
research team.  
In the course of the study participants may reveal impo rtant clinical information to their TCOS 
(tobacco cessation outreach specialist) regarding a serious health issue or change, the TCOS, 
who will be an employee of the healthcare system, will be able to communicate directly with the 
patient’s primary care te am (e.g., if a patient reports  that they are coughing up blood) via the 
EHR and will advise the patient to seek care from their care team or emergency care, as 
appropriate.  
[Incentives for Smoking Treatment Study ]  [Fiore ]

 Routine adverse event assessment will not occur in this study, except in the contex t of smoking 
cessation treatment epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841], given the minimal and informational nature of the health system 
reach interventions and research assessments. Significant adverse events that occur during 
smoking cessation treatment will be gathered by [CONTACT_822423] a s a part of the patient’s standard 
smoking cessation care. AE’s will not be gathered by [CONTACT_3647]. If a patient reports a 
concern AE or health related event to a research staff member, the patient will be encouraged 
to immediately seek medical attenti on from the participating healthcare system.  
10.4 Risk/Benefit Analysis  
This study carries minimal risk. The financial incentives to be deployed pose no risk above and 
beyond standard treatment  and are too small to be coercive . No information about illegal  
behavior will be collected by [CONTACT_822425] . The risk of 
someone's identity becoming known to unauthorized persons is low. This risk is outweighed by 
[CONTACT_533671], and the benefit  to society of having fewer 
people use tobacco products. This research has the potential to benefit smokers in the future by 
[CONTACT_4205][INVESTIGATOR_822405]. Th erefore, the potential gain in knowledge regarding 
engagement incentives associated with the proposed study outweigh the risks of participation.  
10.5 Unanticipated Problems or Complications  
The Principal Investigator (PI) will be responsible for routinely monitoring study progress. UW -
CTRI has a quality assurance monitoring protocol and team in place and will alert the study PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_822406]. Any data safety concerns will be reported to the PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_822407]. We will report a ny unanticipated problems to the IRB according to 
posted guidelines. A full data safety and monitoring plan is included at the end of this protocol.

[ADDRESS_1140416] X____X  from your healthcare provider, GHC - SCW, and I’ve called  as part of 
an important benefit to our patients to help them quit smoking.   
Let me please confirm whom I’m speaking with. [CONFIRMS CALLER IS MEMBER OF GHC -
SCW.]  We want to make sure all our patients who smoke know about the many ways we can 
help them w ith their smoking.  Quitting smoking is the best thing you can do for your health, but 
quitting can be hard. We are here to help even if you are not ready to quit yet.”  
First, can you confirm your date of birth?  Check against EHR to make sure you have the 
correct patient on the phone . 
“I see your last your last visit with us was in Y____Y .”  
• Ask the patient “Are you still smoking?”  
 
If patient initially responds they are no longer smoking, ask “So, just to confirm, you have not 
had even one puff over the las t seven days?”  
If 0, click “No” (Informational Alert should trigger with reminder to adjust Smoking Status in Vital 
Signs/Social History.  Congratulate the patient on quitting and thank them for taking the call.  If 
you need support contact [CONTACT_286334] -xxx-xxxx.  
If >0, click “Yes” advise them to quit and offer treatment: “The most important thing you can do 
to improve your health is to quit smoking and I can help you.  I can help provide medications, 
and treatment support over the phone and via text messages .   
 
Also, check against EHR that patient:  
a) Is on the Cigarette User Registry for a participating clinic  
b) Does not have an existing target quit date ±30 days from date of call to TCOS  
c) Current billable insurance documented  as other than  Medicare or non -BadgerCare 
Medicaid  
d) Preferred language is either English or Spanish

 • The study will give you opportunities to get effective treatments to stop smoking. 
Everyone in the study will be offered our full range of smoking cessation treatment 
options.  
• You will help researchers learn how to offer stop smoking treatments in a way that helps 
more people quit smoking and improve their health.  
 
Here are some reasons you might NOT want to take part in this study:  
• The study collects information about you and your health. You might be uncomfortable 
providing some of this informatio n, and you have the right to refuse to answer any 
question.  
• We will protect your information from unauthorized use and disclosure, but there is still a 
risk that your information could become known to someone not involved in this study.   
 
If you get sick or hurt during this study, please get the help you need right away.  Costs for any 
medical care will be billed to you or your insurance, just like any other medical costs. No other 
compensation (such as lost wages or damages) is usually available.  
 
Any que stions so far? YES ____________________  NO Answer questions  
 
I mentioned we will collect information about you. This information will come from you, and from 
your GHC -SCW  health record for up to 3 years. We’ll use this information to see how our ways 
of offering support to smokers affect their use of stop -smoking treatment, ability to quit smoking, 
and overall health. Collecting information from GHC -SCW  will not affect your relationship with 
GHC -SCW  or the services you receive in any way.  
 
GHC -SCW  and the UW -Madison have strict rules to protect your personal and protected health 
information.  We limit who has access to your name, address, phone number, and other 
information that can identify you. We  also store this information securely. We also have a 
Certificate of Confidentiality from the National Institutes of Health that prohibits us from 
disclosing information that may identify you in a legal proceeding or in response to a legal 
request without your consent. The UW -Madison may publish and present what we learn from 
this study, but none of this information will identify you directly without your permission.  
 
We cannot promise complete confidentiality, however. Federal or state laws may permit or 
require us to show information to university or government officials responsible for monitoring 
this study, and to the National Cancer Institute, which is funding the study.

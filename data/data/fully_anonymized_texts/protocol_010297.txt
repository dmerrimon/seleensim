 1 1  PROTOCOL SUMMARY 1.1 SYNOPSIS  Title:  Postpartum progestin-only pi[INVESTIGATOR_187302]: This study will assess the impact of early initiation (less than one week postpartum) and delayed initiation (4 weeks postpartum) of two types of progestin-only contraceptive pi[INVESTIGATOR_187303], breastmilk, and infant outcomes. This is a placebo-controlled randomized controlled trial enrolling dyads of mothers and their newborn babies. We will explore if the type and timing of initiation of pi[INVESTIGATOR_187304], impacts the supply or composition of breastmilk, and/or affects infant growth.   Aims: Specific Aim: To determine whether the type of progestin used (drospi[INVESTIGATOR_187305]-containing progestin-only pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353] (d-POPs) vs. norethindrone in norethindrone-containing progestin-only pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353] (n-POPs)) or the timing of progestin initiation (early vs. delayed) affects:  Aim 1a Maternal: the duration of exclusive breastfeeding continuation or the rates and types of breastfeeding supplementation over 8 weeks postpartum. Aim 1b Maternal: the proportion of mothers using progestin-only pi[INVESTIGATOR_32404] 8 weeks postpartum.  Aim 2 Milk: the composition of breastmilk (fat, protein, carbohydrates) at 4 weeks postpartum.  Aim 3 Infant: infant growth (weight, length, and head circumference) from birth to 4 weeks.   Study Population: Postpartum women who delivered an infant within the previous 7 days   Description of Sites Enrolling Participants: University of [LOCATION_004], San Diego (UCSD)    Study Duration: 1 year  Participant Duration: 8 weeks

 2 2  INTRODUCTION  2.1 STUDY RATIONALE   Drospi[INVESTIGATOR_187306]-containing progestin-only pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353] (d-POPs) may be an acceptable alternative to Norethindrone-containing progestin-only pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353] (n-POPs) in the postpartum period when initiated either a week or month after delivery with fewer side effects and no impact on breastfeeding, breastmilk, and infant outcomes. Providing women with more options of safe, effective postpartum (PP) contraception has the potential to reduce unintended pregnancy and short inter-pregnancy intervals, thereby [CONTACT_187329].   2.2 BACKGROUND   Use of postpartum (PP) contraception can help women achieve their reproductive goals and prevent short inter-pregnancy intervals (IPIs). Short IPIs (<18 months between birth and subsequent pregnancy) are associated with an increased risk of maternal and infant morbidity and mortality including preterm birth. One-third of pregnancies in the [LOCATION_002] occur after short IPIs; and approximately 70% of pregnancies in the first year after delivery are unintended. Women who receive contraception after delivery are significantly less likely to have an unintended pregnancy and short IPI. Contraception is typi[INVESTIGATOR_187307] 6 weeks after delivery; however, the timing is based on historical precedent, not evidence. By [ADDRESS_221132] resumed intercourse. The CDC provides guidance that it is difficult to be “reasonably certain that woman is not pregnant” beyond 4 weeks PP unless she meets the very stringent criteria for lactational amenorrhea (LAM) which includes exclusive breastfeeding and no interval of greater than 4-[ADDRESS_221133] 6 months of life. Many women want to understand the effects, if any, of contraceptives on breastfeeding outcomes. Among 1,308 pregnant and PP women, 79% reported that safety during breastfeeding was an “extremely important” consideration when choosing contraception.  The natural PP decline in serum progesterone triggers lactogenesis; therefore, there is theoretical concern that use of progestin-containing contraceptives within the first weeks after delivery could inhibit initiation of breastfeeding or impact establishment of supply or composition of breastmilk. In addition, since progestins have been detected in breastmilk, there is concern about the effect of progestin exposure on early infant growth and development. Most existing studies on PP use of progestins initiated within days of delivery are small and of poor to fair quality, but the available data suggest that there is no effect on onset of lactogenesis, quantity or composition of breastmilk, breastfeeding rates, or infant growth. However, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Medical Eligibility Criteria (MEC) for contraceptive use cites a paucity of high-quality data for ongoing concerns about the potential effect of progestins on breastfeeding and infant growth and their decision to categorize progestins use in the early PP period as Category 2 (advantages generally outweigh theoretical or proven risks) instead of Category 1 (no restriction). Whether progestin use affects 
Postpartum Progestin-Only Pi[INVESTIGATOR_187301] [ADDRESS_221134] been associated with decreased breastmilk supply, progestin-only contraception, including progestin-only pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353] (POPs) are commonly used for contraception among breastfeeding women regardless of time since birth. Approximately 16-20% of PP women who intend to breastfeed choose POPs for contraception following delivery in the U.S, approximately 500,000 women per year. Until recently, POPs containing 0.35 mg daily of the oral progestin Norethindrone (n-POPs) have been the only available POP (Table 1). Norethindrone is a variant of progestin derived from testosterone. N-POPs do not consistently inhibit ovulation; the contraceptive mechanism of action is primarily through progestin effects on the cervical mucous and endometrium. They require daily use with a narrow window of time for intake to maintain efficacy and are associated with unpredictable vaginal bleeding patterns and acne. Fewer than half of women who intend to use n-POPs PP use the method at [ADDRESS_221135] a short IPI [INVESTIGATOR_187308]. Drospi[INVESTIGATOR_187309] a novel progestin derived from spi[INVESTIGATOR_8407] (Table 1). POPs containing 4 mg of oral drospi[INVESTIGATOR_187306] (d-POPs) became available for use in the U.S. in 2019. D-POPs consistently suppress ovulation and allow for a wider missed-pi[INVESTIGATOR_187310]-free days which offer the potential to improve ease of use and to decrease irregular bleeding. Unlike norethindrone, drospi[INVESTIGATOR_187311]-androgenic properties and should not exacerbate acne and may improve it. The efficacy of d-POPs among non-breastfeeding women is similar to combined estrogen-progestin pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353]. However, little is known about the effect of d-POPs on breastfeeding performance or PP contraceptive use, efficacy, or side effects among PP women.  Table 1: Progestin types available as progestin-only pi[INVESTIGATOR_187312] 
 D-POPs are promoted for use while breastfeeding despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] a lack of data on the effect of d-POPs on breastfeeding or infant outcomes.

 4 anticipated”  but the only data presented to support the safety of d-POPs among breastfeeding women is an average drospi[INVESTIGATOR_187314] a 24-hour period of 5.6 ng/mL. Only 11 breastfeeding women were included in the published study on d-POP efficacy in the U.S.  The single other published study evaluating d-POPs and breastfeeding outcomes was conducted among only 12 women and showed that 18.13% of plasma drospi[INVESTIGATOR_187315].  High quality data are required to inform CDC guidelines on use of differing progestin types during breastfeeding. Most previous studies have failed to show a negative effect of progestins on breastfeeding or infant growth. However, most existing studies are small, are of poor to fair quality, do not include assessments of d-POPs users and do not use validated outcome measures. Furthermore, most studies evaluating the effect of POPs on breastfeeding have initiated the method at [ADDRESS_221136] of early initiation of POPs was not randomized and compared all progestin users (including pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], injectables, and implants) to non-hormonal contraception users. That study did not show a deleterious effect of progestins on breastfeeding, but it was limited by [CONTACT_171338] a comparison group allowing for assessment of differences in outcomes by [CONTACT_187330]. Other randomized studies comparing the effect of early versus delayed initiation of progestins have evaluated different delivery systems such as intrauterine devices (IUDs) and implants. There are no studies comparing breastfeeding outcomes among d-POP and n-POP users. Most studies have examined the effect of progestins on maternal, milk, or infant outcomes in isolation and have failed to evaluate the effect of progestin exposure during breastfeeding on the mother-milk-infant triad. An adequately powered, high-quality, randomized controlled trial (RCT) using validated measures of maternal, infant and milk outcomes and including d-POP users is needed to minimize the effects of bias and confounding and overcome the weaknesses in the rigor of the prior research. Our goal with this pi[INVESTIGATOR_187316] a future large-scale randomized controlled trial.  2.3 RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSMENT    2.3.[ADDRESS_221137] on breastfeeding, infant growth and high patient satisfaction rates. There may be a benefit to women in the early initiation POP group to avoid unplanned early repeat pregnancies.  2.3.3 ASSESSMENT OF POTENTIAL RISKS AND BENEFITS  The potential benefit of early postpartum POP use outweighs the potential risks of changes to breastmilk, breastfeeding or infant growth changes.    3 OBJECTIVES AND ENDPOINTS

 7 participation will be noted and counted as well. No identifying information will be collected from screen failures.     6 STUDY INTERVENTION  6.1 STUDY INTERVENTION Group 1: Initiation of d-POPs 120-160 hours after delivery (N=10) Group 2: Initiation of n-POPs 120-160 hours after delivery (N=10) Group 3: Initiation of d-POPs 4 weeks after delivery (N=10) [placebo starting 120-160 hours, continuing for 28 days]  6.2 MEASURES TO MINIMIZE BIAS: RANDOMIZATION AND BLINDING Participants will be randomized to their assigned group by [CONTACT_187332] a computer-generated randomization scheme. The participant and investigator will both be blinded to the group assignment. The investigational pharmacy will be aware of the group assignment of each participant and will encapsulate and prepare the blinded medications for the the research coordinator to deliver to the participant.   7 STUDY INTERVENTION DISCONTINUATION AND PARTICIPANT DISCONTINUATION/WITHDRAWAL  7.[ADDRESS_221143] with initiation of the study POPs, she will remain in the study under observation. Remaining study procedures should be completed as indicated by [CONTACT_4690]. Reasons for choosing another method of contraception will be documented and the participant followed for the study duration of 8 weeks.   7.2 PARTICIPANT DISCONTINUATION/WITHDRAWAL FROM THE STUDY Participants may withdraw voluntarily from the study at any time. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_187319]. Medical care will be provided by [CONTACT_102]’s clinician as standard of care in the case of study withdrawal. Research participants who sign the informed consent form, and are randomized and receive the study intervention, and subsequently withdraw, or are withdrawn or discontinued from the study will not be replaced.   7.[ADDRESS_221144] be taken if a participant fails to respond to surveys or return to the clinic for the required study visit:

All women delivering at UCSD hospi[INVESTIGATOR_187320]/or after delivery before discharge from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].   Enrollment Procedures: We will assess women who indicate that they desire POPs for contraception for eligibility after they have received contraceptive counseling. Research staff will identify postpartum women who are planning on utilizing POPs as postpartum contraception via review of medical records of patients receiving inpatient obstetrical services at UCSD. Study staff will visit these potential participants during their inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_187321]-screening eligibility form if the patient is interested in participation. While only women who intend to use POPs for at least 8 weeks will be enrolled, all participants will be told if they are unhappy with POPs at any time, the study team will facilitate timely contraceptive counseling and referral to an appropriate provider to ensure that they can switch contraceptive methods at any time if they choose.  After enrollment and prior to randomization, participants will be asked to complete a brief self-administered demographic questionnaire using a private secure tablet that enters data directly into REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture), a secure electronic data collection system. Demographic characteristics collected will include maternal age, race, Body Mass Index, gestational weight gain, parity, education, previous experience breastfeeding, previous contraceptive use history, breastfeeding intentions, delivery type and complications, infant stay in neonatal intensive care unit (and length of stay), infant birth weight, race, sex assigned at birth, and gestational age at birth. Participants will receive a gift card via text or email link for completing the survey.  Randomization: A licensed medical provider on the clinical care team will review eligibility for the method and instruct patients on use of POPs prior to discharge from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_187322] a prescription for both POPs. Participants will then be randomized to (1) early d-POPs to be initiated at 120-168 hours (5-7 days) after delivery, (2) early n-POPs to be initiated at 120-168 hours after delivery, or (3) placebo for 28 days followed by d-POPs initiated at 4 weeks (28-35 days) after delivery, at a 1:1:1 ratio (Figure 2). Study staff will then provide participants with written and verbal instructions about when to initiate the method and to take the study medications in the order dispensed. Participants, care providers, and research staff will be blinded to group assignment. Participants will be instructed on lactational

 9 amenorrhea method (LAM), a highly effective form of contraception, and will be counseled that if they no longer meet criteria for LAM, then they may be at risk for unintended pregnancy between days 28 and 33 and should use condoms or abstain from intercourse during that time. Before day 28, the CDC Selected Practice Recommendations state that a provider can be “reasonably certain that woman is not pregnant” regardless of LAM use and after day [ADDRESS_221147] an identical appearance.  Figure 2: Outcome Evaluation Study Design                   Surveys:  Investigators will send participants hyperlinks via 5 text messages weekly at the end of weeks 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7 PP. Hyperlinks will lead to a brief questionnaire that participants can complete through a smartphone or tablet. Participants will complete a tablet-based survey in person at their 4 week visit. Participants will receive an emailed hyperlink at the end of week 8 which will lead to a longer questionnaire. A telephone survey will be available as an alternative to the digital questionnaires if desired. Survey questions will address continuation of and satisfaction with breastfeeding, the use of supplemental feeding, types of supplemental feeding being used, use of contraception, and satisfaction with contraception.   At 8 weeks PP, participants will be emailed and requested to complete a more detailed questionnaire eliciting breastfeeding continuation, supplementation amount and type, epi[INVESTIGATOR_187323], perception of adequate milk supply, vaginal bleeding patterns, satisfaction with breastfeeding and Baseline Survey Randomization (N=30) Group 1: Initiation of d-POPs 120-160 hours after delivery (N=10) Group 2: Initiation of n-POPs 120-160 hours after delivery (N=10) Group 3: Initiation of d-POPs 4 weeks after delivery (N=10) [placebo starting 120-160 hours, continuing for 28 days] Surveys Weekly text survey at weeks 2, 3, 5, 6 and 7, breastfeeding continuation and supplementation outcomes (Aim 1) -Electronic survey at 4 and 8 weeks, breastfeeding and contraception outcomes (Aim 1)  Milk and Infant growth outcomes  -Milk sample at 4 weeks, milk composition (Aim 2) -In-person visit at 4 weeks postpartum, infant weight and body composition (Aim 3)

Breastmilk collection and analysis: Women will attend an in-person visit at [ADDRESS_221149] pump. 10 mLs of breastmilk from the collection (either refrigerated sample brought to the visit or collected on-site) will be frozen at the site of the visit at the research site. The milk samples will be frozen at -[ADDRESS_221150] (DSMB) is not planned for this small pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]. 8.3 ADVERSE EVENTS AND SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  8.3.1 DEFINITION OF ADVERSE EVENTS (AE)  The FDA definition of an Adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of an intervention in humans, whether or not considered intervention-related (21 CFR 312.32 (a)).   8.3.2 DEFINITION OF SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS (SAE)   An adverse event (AE) or suspected adverse reaction is considered "serious" if, in the view of either the investigator or sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: death, a life-threatening adverse event, inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect. Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the participant and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.   8.3.3 CLASSIFICATION OF AN ADVERSE EVENT  [IP_ADDRESS] SEVERITY OF EVENT For adverse events (AEs) not included in the protocol defined grading system, the following guidelines will be used to describe severity.   
Postpartum Progestin-Only Pi[INVESTIGATOR_187301] 803604  
 11 • Mild – Events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the participant’s daily activities.  • Moderate – Events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the therapeutic measures. Moderate events may cause some interference with functioning. • Severe – Events interrupt a participant’s usual daily activity and may require systemic drug therapy or other treatment. Severe events are usually potentially life-threatening or incapacitating.  Of note, the term “severe” does not necessarily equate to “serious”.   [IP_ADDRESS] RELATIONSHIP TO STUDY INTERVENTION  All adverse events (AEs) must have their relationship to study intervention assessed by [CONTACT_61186]/her clinical judgment. The degree of certainty about causality will be graded using the categories below. In a clinical trial, the study product must always be suspect.   • Related – The AE is known to occur with the study intervention, there is a reasonable possibility that the study intervention caused the AE, or there is a temporal relationship between the study intervention and event. Reasonable possibility means that there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the study intervention and the AE. • Not Related – There is not a reasonable possibility that the administration of the study intervention caused the event, there is no temporal relationship between the study intervention and event onset, or an alternate etiology has been established.  OR  • Definitely Related – There is clear evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and other possible contributing factors can be ruled out. The clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test result, occurs in a plausible time relationship to study intervention administration and cannot be explained by [CONTACT_9153]. The response to withdrawal of the study intervention (DE challenge) should be clinically plausible. The event must be pharmacologically or phenomenologically definitive, with use of a satisfactory rechallenge procedure if necessary. • Probably Related – There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and the influence of other factors is unlikely. The clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test result, occurs within a reasonable time after administration of the study intervention, is unlikely to be attributed to concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals, and follows a clinically reasonable response on withdrawal (dechallenge). Rechallenge information is not required to fulfill this definition. • Potentially Related – There is some evidence to suggest a causal relationship (e.g., the event occurred within a reasonable time after administration of the trial medication). However, other factors may have contributed to the event (e.g., the participant’s clinical condition, other concomitant events). Although an AE may rate only as “possibly related” soon after discovery, it can be flagged as requiring more information and later be upgraded to “probably related” or “definitely related”, as appropriate. • Unlikely to be related – A clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test result, whose temporal relationship to study intervention administration makes a causal relationship improbable (e.g., the event did not occur within a reasonable time after administration of the 
Postpartum Progestin-Only Pi[INVESTIGATOR_187301] 803604  
 12 study intervention) and in which other drugs or chemicals or underlying disease provides plausible explanations (e.g., the participant’s clinical condition, other concomitant treatments). • Not Related – The AE is completely independent of study intervention administration, and/or evidence exists that the event is definitely related to another etiology. There must be an alternative, definitive etiology documented by [CONTACT_15370].   [IP_ADDRESS] EXPECTEDNESS   The PI [INVESTIGATOR_21190] (AE) is expected or unexpected.  An AE will be considered unexpected if the nature, severity, or frequency of the event is not consistent with the risk information previously described for the study intervention. 8.3.4 TIME PERIOD AND FREQUENCY FOR EVENT ASSESSMENT AND FOLLOW-UP  The occurrence of an adverse event (AE) or serious adverse event (SAE) may come to the attention of study personnel during study visits and interviews of a study participant presenting for medical care, by [CONTACT_187334], or upon review by a study monitor.  All AEs including local and systemic reactions not meeting the criteria for SAEs will be captured. Information to be collected includes event description, time of onset, clinician’s assessment of severity, relationship to study product (assessed only by [CONTACT_8703] a diagnosis), and time of resolution/stabilization of the event. All AEs occurring while on study must be documented appropriately regardless of relationship. All AEs will be followed to adequate resolution.  Any medical condition that is present at the time that the participant is screened will be considered as baseline and not reported as an AE. However, if the study participant’s condition deteriorates at any time during the study, it will be recorded as an AE. Changes in the severity of an AE will be documented to allow an assessment of the duration of the event at each level of severity to be performed. AEs characterized as intermittent require documentation of onset and duration of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865].  At each study visit, the investigator will inquire about the occurrence of AE/SAEs since the last visit.  Events will be followed for outcome information until resolution or stabilization.  8.3.5 ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING   All adverse events will be reported to th UCSD IRB. The management of information that is relevant to the protection of participants including adverse events, UPRs, protocol violations/deviations, interim results and protocol modifications will be the responsibility of the PI.  8.3.6 SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING   All serious adverse events will be reported to th UCSD IRB. The management of information that is relevant to the protection of participants including adverse events, UPRs, protocol violations/deviations, interim results and protocol modifications will be the responsibility of the PI.

 13 8.3.7 REPORTING EVENTS TO PARTICIPANTS   The UCSD IRB provide guidance to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_187324].   8.4 UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS  8.4.1 DEFINITION OF UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS (UP)  Unanticipated problems involving risks to participants or others to include, in general, any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the following criteria:  • Unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency given (a) the research procedures that are described in the protocol-related documents, such as the Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved research protocol and informed consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the participant population being studied; • Related or possibly related to participation in the research (“possibly related” means there is a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_3459]); and • Suggests that the research places participants or others at a greater risk of harm (including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized.   8.4.2  UNANTICIPATED PROBLEM REPORTING   The investigators will report unanticipated problems (UPs) to the reviewing Institutional Review Board (IRB) and to the lead principal investigator (PI). The UP report will include the following information:  • Protocol identifying information: protocol title and number, PI’s name, and the IRB project number; • A detailed description of the event, incident, experience, or outcome;  • An explanation of the basis for determining that the event, incident, experience, or outcome represents an UP;  • A description of any changes to the protocol or other corrective actions that have been taken or are proposed in response to the UP.  To satisfy the requirement for prompt reporting, UPs will be reported to the IRB within reasonable timing of the investigator becoming aware of the problem.     8.4.[ADDRESS_221151], or t-tests as appropriate.   9.2 SAMPLE SIZE DETERMINATION  The sample size (N=30 in 6 months) was chosen to demonstrate feasibility to enroll 180 women in 36 months at our site during a larger multi-site trial and to successfully complete follow-up.    9.3 POPULATIONS FOR ANALYSES  The following datasets will be utilized for analysis:  • Intention-to-Treat Analysis Dataset: All participants randomized with known outcomes per the 8 week follow up survey. • Per-Protocol Analysis Dataset: Participants who reported taking their assigned POP throughout the study period and reported follow up data on the 8 week survey.   9.4 STATISTICAL ANALYSES  9.4.1 GENERAL APPROACH  9.4.2 ANALYSIS OF THE PRIMARY EFFICACY ENDPOINT(S)  A survival analysis will be conducted to to assess time spent exclusively breastfeeding.   9.4.3 ANALYSIS OF THE SECONDARY ENDPOINT(S) Proportions will be compared using chi-square tests. ANOVAs will be used to calculate means for analysis using all 3 groups and t-tests for any pairwise comparisons.  9.4.4 SAFETY ANALYSES  AEs and SAEs will be recorded by [CONTACT_187335]. Adverse events leading to premature discontinuation from the study intervention and serious treatment-emergent AEs will be presented in a table.  9.4.5 BASELINE DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS  Baseline characteristics such as demographic information (age, education level, race, ethnicity and employment status) will be collected. At the time of enrollment, questions will also be asked about pregnancy history, past use of contraception, use of donor milk and current perception of adequacy of

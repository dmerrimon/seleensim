5 Deep inspi[INVESTIGATOR_114555] (DIBH) techniques have been developed to help minimize 
cardiac and lung dose. As a patient takes a deep breath, the lungs fill with air, causin g 
the heart to be displaced posteriorly and inferiorly outside of the radiation tangential 
beams. This movement increases the distance between the heart and chest wall. With 
this distance in place, the radiation tangential beams can target the breast or ch est wall 
with significantly less cardiac irradiation. Figure [ADDRESS_853197] in DIBH during radiation treatments. One of the more 
common ways is by [CONTACT_2329] a commercially available system Active Breathing Coordinator 
(ABC; Elekta, Crawl ey, [LOCATION_006]) device. The ABC system has a digital spi[INVESTIGATOR_638144]. When the patient inspi[INVESTIGATOR_36736] a preset DIBH level, a balloon valve is 
inflated so as to prevent the patient from breathing out and thereby  [CONTACT_360888] a consistent 
chest wall expansion with each DIBH. A nose clip prevents air leakage. The therapi[INVESTIGATOR_638145] s the respi[INVESTIGATOR_638146]. 
When the patient depresses a handheld thumb switch, treatment i s stopped and valve 
opens so breathing can resume normally again. Dosimetric advantages of cardiac 
sparing using DIBH ABC technique ha ve been shown .3, 4

6 A more recent,  competing  technology  for implementing the DIBH technique is  real-time 
surface photogrammetry using the  AlignRT system (Vision RT Ltd., London, [LOCATION_006]) , shown 
in Figure [ADDRESS_853198] scan serves as a baseline. In the treatment room, a 
speckled optical pattern in the visible red range is projected on the patient’s thoraco -
abdominal  surface  by [CONTACT_638161] -mounted imaging pods. Once the patient has 
matched the pre -determined DIBH position (with 2 mm accuracy), the radiation beam is 
enabled to be turned on for t reatment. The optical pattern is imaged by [CONTACT_638162] 
(two per pod) at ~[ADDRESS_853199] (ROI) on the surface and 
the software calculates and displays the real -time position in six degrees (3 translations 
and 3 rotations) i n real -time (Figure 4 right panel) . Since visible light is used for the 
position monitoring, there is no additional (non -therapeutic) ionizing radiation delivered to 
the patient.  
 
Several studies have pointed out potential drawbacks of the ABC system. E.g ., even 
though the patient ’s tidal volume remains consistent with ABC, different breathing 
maneuvers (abdominal versus thoracic breathing) can cause for variations in breath -
hold.[ADDRESS_853200], it monitors 
patie nt (surface) position which is a more relevant surrogate for internal motion than the 
tidal volume (e.g., the tidal volume can remain the same even if the patient shifts slightly 
on the couch). Thus VRT can monitor residual motion during the breath -hold. S econd, 
from a clinical standpoint, the VRT system  
• requires no patient training during sim or Tx  
• takes approximately half the time for treatment  
• Is much more cost effective, as patient tubing needs to be replaced daily for ABC  
The one potential advantage o f ABC over VRT is that the former system performs an 
assisted breath -hold (i.e., the patient is actively impeded from inhale/exhale) while the 
VRT system depends entirely on patient compliance.  
 
The purpose of this study is to perform an intra -patient com parison of ABC vs VisionRT 
for DIBH in left -sided chest wall radiotherapy. The primary goals are to record the 
presence and magnitude of residual motion during DIBH and determine the clinical 
impact of motion in terms of changes in heart and lung dose with respect to that 
calculated in the treatment plan.

quantified.  
 
Minutes of daily radiation setup and treatment delivery will b e recorded for all daily 
radiation fractions. Mean and median setup and treatment delivery times for ABC versus 
VRT will then be compared.  
 
The DIBH levels will be recorded daily (on both ABC and VRT days) using the VisionRT 
system and the inter -fraction r eproducibility of the DIBH level will be calculated for ABC 
and VisionRT.

4.2 Toxicities and Dosing Delays/Dose Modifications  
Any subject  who receives treatment on this protocol will be evaluable for toxicity . Each 
patient will be assessed for the development of toxicity according to the Time and Events 
table . Toxicity will be assessed according to the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria for 
Adver se Events (CTCAE), version 4.0. Dose adjustments should be made according to 
the system showing the greatest degree of toxicity .  
 
Expected toxicities are those that we would normally consent patients for breast radiation. 
As we are not modifying the dose or treatment volume from standard breast radiation we 
will not have dose modifications.  
Potential breast radiotherapy toxicities include: dermatitis, fatigue, hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_371], 
brachial plexopathy, radiation pneumonitis, shrinkage of the breast, coronary artery 
disease, pericarditis, rib damage or fracture.

• Disease progression  
• Inter-current illness that prevents further administration of treatment  
• Unacceptable adverse event(s)  
• Subject  decides to withdraw from the study, OR 
• General or specific changes in the patient’s condition render the subject 
unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator”.  
4.4 Duration of Follow Up

See section 6 for Adverse Event monitoring and reporting.  
5.2 Proced ures During Treatment  
5.2.1  Prior to Radiation  Treatment Cycle  
• Physical exam, vital signs  
• Consent  
• Eligibility/ineligibility criteria  
5.2.[ADDRESS_853214] simulation  
• CT Simulation  scan in free breathing  
• CT simulation  scan with DIBH and ABC machine - must ensure tubing from 
ABC not over chest wall so skin rendering is able to be reproduced  
• Preparation of vac lock bag, coaching for breath  hold sh ould not be included 
in timing  
• Planning and contouring - 
• Structures that should be contoured are lumpectomy cavity, heart, left anterior 
descending artery, lungs, and ipsilateral breast tissue  
• Simulation and treatment may be performed with the patient in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_508135]  
• Patients should be optimally posi tioned with alpha cradle casts, breast boards, 
or wing boards and/ or other methods of immobilization at the discretion of the 
treating physician.  
• A treatment planning CT scan in the treatment position will be required to 
define the clinical target volumes  (CTV) and planning target volumes (PTV  
• Radio -opaque markers should be placed on external landmarks at the 
acquisition of the CT scan to facilitate contouring segmentation of the CT 
data-set. These markers should identify: 1) The mastectomy  incision 2) The  
outline of the palpable chest wall tissue circumferentially at least from 2 
o’clock to 10 o’clock  3) The superior border of the chest wall  tissue at 12 
o’clock based on palpation. Additional markers to define the borders of 
“clinical” tangent fields (e.g.  based on the palpable chest wall tissue and 
boney landmarks) are often helpful.  
• The CT should extend cephalad to start at or above the mandible and extend 
sufficientl y caudally (or inferiorly) to the inframammary fold to encompass the 
entire lung volume. A CT scan image thickness of ≤ 0.5 cm should be 
employed . 
• External skin localizing marks, which may include permanent tattoos, are 
recommended for radiation daily local ization and set -up accuracy.  
• CT simulation will likely be around 1 hour in length one time  
 
Treatment Planning/Target Volumes  
 
The definitions for the CTV, PTV and normal structures used in this protocol 
generally conform  to the RTOG -endorsed consensus gui delines for delineation of 
target and normal structures for breast cancer  
(http://www.rtog.org/CoreLab/ContouringAtlases/BreastCancerAtlas.aspx ) 
and the 1993 ICRU report #50: Prescribing, Recording and Reporting Photon 
Beam Therapy.  
The plans generated using forward -planning methods or segmental techniques  
such as “field -in-field” to meet dose -volume constraints are considered as 
3DCRT  
plans. These forward -planned or segmental treatment techniques are those  
STU 052015 -047   
STU052015 -047, Rahimi, FormA -ResearchProtocol, Mod_20, 12 -17-19 (1)  
[ADDRESS_853215] critical structures (e.g., heart or lung). 
3D-CRT should be used for planning.  
 
Chestwall CTV : Includes the Mastectomy Scar CTV, and takes into account the 
radiopaque marker s placed at CT identifying clinical extent of chestwall, surgical 
changes visualized by [CONTACT_4654], and consensus definitions of anatomical borders of 
chestwall from the RTOG Breast Cancer Atlas 
http://www.rtog.org/CoreLab/ContouringAtlases/BreastCancerAtlas.aspx.   
The Chestwall CTV is limited by [CONTACT_638163]. Depending on the location of 
the Mastectomy Scar CTV, it should exclude the sternum medially and the axilla 
deep to ant erior surface of the pectoralis major muscle laterally. In general, the 
chestwall CTV should not cross midline.  
Expanders, implants or autologous tissue present for reconstruction will be 
included in the Chestwall CTV. The degree of expander expansion pre sent is per 
the treating physician’s discretion. The expander should remain at the same 
expansion through the course of treatment that is present for the CT simulation.  
 
Chestwall PTV:  Chestwall CTV + 7 mm 3D expansion (excludes heart and does 
not cross m idline).  
 
Chestwall PTV Eval : As a part of the Chestwall PTV often extends outside the 
patient, the Chestwall PTV is then copi[INVESTIGATOR_99628] a Chestwall PTV Eval which is 
edited. This Chestwall PTV Eval is limited anteriorly to exclude the part outside

of the buildup region for the DVH analysis) and posteriorly is limited to no deeper 
than the posterior rib surface and excludes lung and heart. In general, the 
Chestwall CTV shoul d not cross midline. This Chestwall PTV Eval is the structure 
used for DVH constraints and analysis and not for beam aperture generation.

verification.  
 
Contralateral lung.  This may be contoured with auto -segmentation with manual 
verification  
 
Heart:  This is to be contoured on all cases - not just the left sided cases. The 
heart should  be contoured beginning just inferior to the level in which the 
pulmonary trunk branches into the  left and right pulmonary arteries (PA). Above 
the PA, none of the heart’s [ADDRESS_853216] extent near the diaphragm. The following structures if identifiable should be 
excluded from the heart contour: esophagus, great vessels (ascending and 
descending aorta, inferior vena cava). One need not include pericardial f at, if 
present. Contouring along the pericardium itself, when visible, is appropriate.  
Left Anterior Descending Artery:  The left anterior descending artery (LAD), 
including the small segment of left coronary artery before bifurcation, was  
contoured, with a  3-mm diameter, from its origin, continued between the left 
ventricle and right ventricle in the interventricular groove, and to the inferior 
border of  
the heart.  
 
Thyroid: The thyroid is easily visible on a non -contrast CT due to its preferential 
absorpti on of Iodine,  rendering it “brighter” or denser than the surrounding neck 
soft tissues. The left and right  lobes of the thyroid are somewhat triangular in

5.5 Removal of Subjects from Study  
Subjects can be taken off the study treatment and/or study at any time at their own 
request, or they may be withdrawn at the discretion of the investigator for safety, 
behavioral or administrative reasons. The reason(s) for discontinuation will be 
documented and may include:  
5.5.[ADDRESS_853221]  voluntarily withdraws from treatment (follow -up pe rmitted);  
5.5.[ADDRESS_853222]  withdraws consent (termination of treatment and follow -up); 
5.5.[ADDRESS_853223]  is unable to comply with protocol requirements;  
5.5.[ADDRESS_853224]  demonstrates disease progression (unless continued treatment with 
study drug is deemed appropriate at the discretion of the investigator);  
5.5.[ADDRESS_853225]  experiences toxicity that makes continuation in the protocol unsafe;

5.6 Randomization  
In order to minimize technology -specific bias in this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], ten patients will be 
randomly assigned to two groups of five patients each. The probability of being assigned 
to each group is 0.5. Randomization log will be created. Five patients in group  1 will be 
administered 14 fractions with ABC -assisted DIBH, followed by 14 fractions with VRT -

[ADDRESS_853229] safety and care.  
 
All subjects experiencing an adverse event, regardless of its relationship to study 
therapy, will be monitored until:  
➢ the adverse event resolves or the symptoms or signs that constitute the adverse 
event return to baseline or is stable in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_1101] t he investigator;  
➢ there is a satisfactory explanation other than the study therapy for the changes 
observed; or  
➢ death.  
6.1.[ADDRESS_853230] or unfavorable medical occurrence in a 
human research study participant, includin g any abnormal sign (for example, abnormal 
physical exam, imaging finding or clinically significant laboratory finding), symptom, 
clinical event, or disease, temporarily associated with the subject’s participation in the 
research, whether or not it is cons idered related to the subject’s participation in the 
research.  
Adverse events encompass clinical, physical and psychological harms. Adverse events 
occur most commonly in the context of biomedical research, although on occasion, they 
can occur in the contex t of social and behavioral research. Adverse events may be 
expected or unexpected.  
Acute Adverse Events  
Adverse events occurring in the time period from the signing of the informed consent, 
through treatment, until the last day, will be considered acute a dverse events.  
Severity  
Adverse events will be graded by a numerical score according to the defined NCI 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) Version 5.0. Adverse 
events not specifically defined in the NCI CTCAE will be scored on the Adverse Event log 
accordi ng to the general guidelines provided by [CONTACT_114642].   
• Grade 1: Mild  
• Grade 2: Moderate  
• Grade 3: Severe or medically significant but not immediately life threatening  
• Grade 4: Life threatening consequences  
• Grade 5: Death related to the adverse event

STU052015 -047, Rahimi, FormA -ResearchProtocol, Mod_20, 12 -17-19 (1)  
16 Serious Adverse Events  
ICH Guideline E2A and the UTSW IRB define serious adverse events as those events, 
occurring at any dose, which meets any of the following criteria:  
• Results in death   
• Immediately life -threatening  
• Resu lts in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]1,2 or prolongation of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• Results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• Based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the subject’s  health 
and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other 
outcomes listed in this definition.  
Note: A “Serious adverse event” is by [CONTACT_283095]. Serious adverse events may or may not b e related to the research project. A 
serious adverse event determination does not require the event to be related to the 
research. That is, both events completely unrelated to the condition under study and 
events that are expected in the context of the con dition under study may be serious 
adverse events, independent of relatedness to the study itself. As examples, a car 
accident requiring >24 hour inpatient admission to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_263996] a serious 
adverse event for any research participant; likewise, in  a study investigating end -stage 
cancer care, any hospi[INVESTIGATOR_263997] -specified 
period of monitoring for adverse and serious adverse events would be a serious adverse 
event, even if the event observed is a primary clin ical endpoint of the study.  
1Pre-planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_114579]. Note: If 
events occur during a pre -planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_64329], that prolong the existing 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], those events should be evaluated and/ or reported as SAEs.   
2 NCI defines hospi[INVESTIGATOR_263999] 24 hours. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_638151] d for situations where the AE 
truly fits this definition and NOT for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_360878]. 
For example: a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_114582] a patient is admitted for observation or minor 
treatment (e.g. hydration) and released in less th an 24 hours. Furthermore, 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_264001] a routine AE or in an expedited report.   
 
 
 
 
6.1.2  Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to Subjects or Others (UPI[INVESTIGATOR_20865]):  
The phrase “unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others” is found, but not 
defined in the HHS regulations at 45 CFR 46, and the FDA regulations at 21 CFR 
56.108(b)(1) and [ADDRESS_853231], which is defined in 21 CFR 812.3(s). Guidance from 
the regulatory agencies considers unanticipated problems to include any incident, 
experience, or outcome that meets ALL three (3) of the following criteria:  
• Unexpected in terms of na ture, severity or frequency given (a) the research procedures 
that are described in the protocol -related documents, such as the IRB -approved research 
protocol and informed consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the subject 
population being studie d;  
STU 052015 -047   
STU052015 -047, Rahimi, FormA -ResearchProtocol, Mod_20, 12 -17-19 (1)  
17     AND  
• Related or possibly related to participation in the research (possibly related means there 
is a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have been 
caused by [CONTACT_3459]);  
 AND  
• Suggests th at the research places subjects or others at greater risk of harm (including 
physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or 
recognized. Note: According to OHRP, if the adverse event is serious, it would always 
suggest a gre ater risk of harm.  
 
Follow -up  
All adverse events will be followed up according to good medical practices.  
 
6.2 Steps to Determine If a Serious Adverse Event Requires Expedited Reporting to the 
SCCC DSMC and/or HRPP  
Step 1 : Identify the type of adverse event using the NCI Common Terminology Criteria 
for Adverse Events (CTCAE v5).  
 
Step 2 : Grade the adverse event using the NCI CTCAE v5.  
 
Step 3 : Determine whether the adverse event is related to the protocol therapy.  
Attribut ion categories are as follows:  
- Definite – The AE is clearly related  to the study treatment.  
- Probable – The AE is likely related to the study treatment.  
- Possible – The AE may be related  to the study treatment.  
- Unlikely – The AE may NOT be  related  to the study treatment.  
- Unrelated – The AE is clearly NOT related  to the study treatment.  
Note : This includes all events that occur to the end of the acute adverse events reporting 
period as defined in section 6.1 . 
 
Step 4 : Determine the prior experience of the adverse event. Expected events are those 
that have been previously identified as resulting from administration of the treatment. An 
adverse event is considered unexpected, for expedited reporting purposes only, when 
either the type of event or the s everity of the event is not listed in:  
• the current known adverse events listed in the Agent Information Section of this 
protocol (if applicable);  
• the drug package insert (if applicable);  
• the current Investigator’s Brochure (if applicable)  
• the Study Agent(s)/Therapy(ies) Background and Associated Known Toxicities 
section of this protocol  
 
6.2.1  Reporting SAEs and UPI[INVESTIGATOR_264002] 
(SCCC) Data Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC)  
 
All SAE/UPI[INVESTIGATOR_114585], which occur in re search subjects on protocols for which the 
SCCC is the DSMC of record require reporting to the DSMC regardless of whether IRB 
reporting is required. All SAEs/UPI[INVESTIGATOR_114586] -specified 
monitoring period should be submitted to the SCCC DSMC within 5 business days of the 
PI [INVESTIGATOR_114587](s). In addition, for 
participating centers other than UTSW, local IRB guidance should be followed for local 
reporting of serious adverse events.

The UTSW study team is responsible for submitting SAEs/UPI[INVESTIGATOR_114588].  Hardcopi[INVESTIGATOR_114589]; FDA 
Form #3500A forms, or other sponsor forms, if applicable; and/or any other supporting 
documentation available should be submitted to the DSMC Coordinator.  The DSMC 
Coordinator forwards the information onto the DSMC Chairman who determines if 
immediate action is required.  Follow -up eIRB reports, and all subsequent SAE/UPI[INVESTIGATOR_638152] t hat is available are also submitted to the DSMC Chair who determines if 
further action is required. (See Appendix III of the SCCC DSMC Plan for a template Serious 
Adverse Event Form which may be utilized when a sponsor form is unavailable and SAE 
submissio n to the eIRB is not required).  
   
If the event occurs on a multi -institutional clinical trial coordinated by [CONTACT_264024], the DOT Manager or lead coordinator ensures that all 
participating sites are notified of the event a nd resulting action, according to FDA 
guidance for expedited reporting. DSMC Chairperson reviews all SAEs/UPI[INVESTIGATOR_375284].  The DSMC Chairperson determines whether action 
is required and either takes action immediately, conve nes a special DSMC session 
(physical or electronic), or defers the action until a regularly scheduled DSMC meeting.

terms of increased dose to the heart and lung . The findings from these studies will be used to 
inform the sample size for a future larger scale (Phase II) study.  
7.1  Study Design/Study Endpoints  
A single -center prospective pi[INVESTIGATOR_360876]. Informed consent will be obtained from ten 
post-mastectomy , left-sided breast cancer patients , each to be treated with 50.4 Gy/ 28 
fx. In order to minimize technology -specific bias, the patients will be divided into two 
groups of five each. Group 1 will be administered 14 fractions with ABC -assisted DIBH, 
followed by 14 fractions with VRT -assisted DIBH. Group 2 will be administered 14 
fractions with VRT -assisted DIBH, fo llowed by 14 fractions with ABC -assisted DIBH. 
(Both ABC and VRT  are FDA -approved for clinical use and are used  in our clinic as 
standard -of-care.)  
 
In each case, the residual motion during DIBH -assisted dose delivery will be recorded via 
MV fluoroscopy of the exiting beam using an electronic portal imaging device (EPID). 
Note that this procedure does not involve the administration of any additional non -
therapeutic ionizing radiation to the patient (other than the prescribed dose).

20 7.3   Data Analyses Plans  
Individual frames from each MV fluoroscopic series will be imported into Velocity (a 
clinically available medical image processing software) and a rigid registration will be 
performed between successive frames in order to quantify the residual motion during a 
DIBH. The mean, and median value of motion obtained for VRT DIBH and ABC DIBH will 
then be used to translate axial CT images in Velocity  and the originally planned beam 
arrangement will be used to recalculate the treatment plan and compute the dose to the 
displaced anatomy.  In this manner, the  dosimetric impact of residual motion on critical 
organs such as the heart and lung will be quantif ied.

policy . 
8.2 Data Management and Monitoring/Auditing  
 
REDCap is the UTSW SCCC institutional choice for the electronic data capture of case 
report forms for SCCC Investigator Initiated Trials. REDCap will be used for electronic 
case report forms in accordance with Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center 
requirements, as appropriate for t he project  
 
Trial monitoring will be conducted no less than annually and refers to a regular interval 
review of trial related activity and documentation performed by [CONTACT_375298]/or the CRO 
Multi -Center IIT Monitor. This review includes but is not limited t o accuracy of case report 
forms, protocol compliance, timeless and accuracy of Velos entries and AE/SAE 
management and reporting. Documentation of trial monitoring will be maintained along 
with other protocol related documents and will be reviewed during i nternal audit.   
 
For further information, refer to the UTSW SCCC IIT Management Manual . 
 
Toxicity and dose escalation reviews will be annually . The reviews will be documented by 
[CONTACT_638164].  
 
The UTSW Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center (SCCC) Data Safety Monitoring 
Committee (DSMC) is responsible for monitoring data quality and patient safety for all 
UTSW SCCC clinical trials.  As part of that responsibility, the DSMC reviews all local 
serious adverse events a nd UPI[INVESTIGATOR_375289] a quarterly basis.  The quality assurance activity for the Clinical 
Research Office provides for periodic auditing of clinical research documents to ensure 
data integrity and regula tory compliance.  A copy of the DSMC plan is available upon 
request.  
 
The SCCC DSMC meets quarterly and conducts annual comprehensive reviews of 
ongoing clinical trials, for which it serves as the DSMC of record. The QAC works as part 
of the DSMC to conduc t regular audits based on the level of risk. Audit findings are 
reviewed at the next available DSMC meeting.  In this way, frequency of DSMC 
monitoring is dependent upon the level of risk.  Risk level is determined by [CONTACT_375299] a number of fact ors such as the phase of the study; the type of 
investigational agent, device or intervention being studied; and monitoring required to

8.3.1  Exceptions (also called sin gle-subject exceptions or single -subject waivers): 
include any departure from IRB -approved research that is not due to an 
emergency  and is:  
• intentional on part of the investigator; or  
• in the investigator’s control; or  
• not intended as a systemic change (e.g ., single -subject exceptions to eligibility  
[inclusion/exclusion] criteria)  
➢ Reporting requirement : Exceptions are non -emergency deviations that require prospective  
IRB approval before being implemented. Call the IRB if your request is 
urgent. If IRB approval is not obtained beforehand, this constitutes a major 
deviation.  
8.3.2  Emergency Deviations: include any departure from IRB -approved research that 
is necessary to:  
• avoid immediate apparent harm, or  
• protect the life or physical well -being of subjects or others

to the IRB within 5 working days of occurrence.  
 
8.3.3  Major Deviations (also called  violations ): include any departure from IRB -
approved research that:  
• Harmed or placed subject(s) or others at risk of harm (i.e., did or has the 
potential to negatively  affect the safety, rights, or welfare of subjects or 
others), or  
• Affect data quality (e .g., the completeness, accuracy, reliability, or validity of 
the data) or the  science of the research (e.g., the primary outcome/endpoint of 
the study)  
➢ Reporting requirement : Major deviations must be promptly reported to  
the IRB within 5 working days of  PI [INVESTIGATOR_38417].  
 
8.3.4  Minor Deviations: include any departure from IRB -approved research that:  
• Did not harm or place subject(s) or others at risk of harm (i.e., did not or did 
not have the potential to negatively affect the safety, rights, or welfare of 
subjects or others), or  
• Did not affect data quality (e.g., the completeness, accuracy, reliability, or 
validity of the data) or the science of the research (e.g., the primary 
outcome/endpoint of the study)  
➢ Reporting requirement : Minor deviations should b e tracked and summarized 
in the progress report at the next IRB continuing review.

3 Background  
3.1 Anxiety in O lder Veterans.  Older Veterans represent the majority (45%) of VA patients (Karlin, 
Zeiss, & Burris, 2010) and often are afflicted with mental health problems (Hankin, Spi[INVESTIGATOR_2152], Miller,  
& Kazis, 1999) . Of these mental health problems, a nxiety disorders are one of the most common 
late-life disorders (Gum et al., 2009). The consequences of a nxiety can be costly (Marciniak et 
al., 2005) and devastating, including greater risk of a second myocardial infarction (Kubzansky et 
al., 1 997) and cognitive impairment (Beaudreau & O’Hara, 2008). Anxiety in older adults is 
associated with increased health care utilization (de Beurs et al., 1999), poor medication 
adherence (Gentil, Vasiliadis, Préville, Bossé, & Berbiche, 2012), and poor qua lity of life (de 
Beurs et al., 1999). Anxiety disorders are also comorbid with chronic medical conditions and 
depression in older patients (By[CONTACT_487757]., 2010; Qureshi et al., 2012) . A critical but understudied 
issue relevant to anxiety and functioning is  the role of these co -occurring disorders , or 
comorbidities. Because functional impairmen t and disability are already pervasive among 
patients with comorbidity, comorbid medical conditions in anxious individuals are very 
concerning (Marengoni et al., 2011) . Anxiety is therefore a crucial issue for VA patients given the 
multitude of adverse consequences that accompany presence of anxiety and comorbid medical conditions, thus significantly limiting patients’ ability to function independently.  
 
3.[ADDRESS_910022] been effective in treating late -life anxiety and avoidance. In a meta -analysis of late -life 
anxiety psychotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], Thorp  and colleagues (2009) found that Progressive Muscle Relaxation 
(PMR) resulted in the largest reductions in anxiety compared with waitlist controls, supportive 
therapy, and other efficacious therapi[INVESTIGATOR_673487] (CBT). PMR is a 
component of CBT for anxiety  (e.g., Stanley et al., 2009) , yet only one session of CBT is typi[INVESTIGATOR_673488], which may be inadequate for older individuals to fully learn the skill. 
As such, older adults may not consolidate the techniques for utilizing PMR despi[INVESTIGATOR_673489]. Furthermore, dissemination of efficacious non -pharmacological  
treatments to older Veterans with anxiety disorders has yet to be achieved. Few VA outpatient 
mental health programs focus on the treatment of older Veter ans with anxiety. Moreover, 
disparities in the receipt of mental health services exist among Veterans with different anxiety 
diagnoses (Barrera et al., 2014). Veterans with anxiety disorder not otherwise specified  are both 
older less likely to receive mental health services compared with Veterans with other anxiety 
diagnoses  (Barrera et a l., 2014) . 
3.3 BREATHE Overview . To address the aforementioned  barriers  to accessing non -pharmacological 
interventions , the PI [INVESTIGATOR_77136] a self -directed program to treat late-life anxiety called 
Breathing, Relaxation, and Education for Anxiety  Treatment in the Home Environment 
Gould CDA Study 3 Protocol   2 (BREATHE). BREATHE is a four -week behavioral intervention that uses evidence -based 
behavioral tec hniques (diaphragmatic breathing and progressive muscle relaxation) to reduce 
anxiety symptoms and avoidance in older adults. BREATHE is designed to be aligned with the 
tenets of Social Learning Theory (Bandura, 1971). BREATHE incorporate s experiential and 
observational learning to promote decreased avoidance of identified activities. In Social Learning Theory, Bandura posits that learning can take place through observation of a model’s 
behavior in addition to the observer’s direct experience. Thus, decreas ing reliance on avoidance 
as a copi[INVESTIGATOR_673490]: (1) the 
reduction of anxiety symptoms through experiential learning of relaxation and breathing skills, 
(2) experiential learning through approac hing situations that are uncomfortable and avoided 
after using PMR, and (3) observation of a model who engages in an anxiety -evoking situation 
avoided by [CONTACT_63634]. eHealth interventions for young adults use vignettes and case 
examples to model how to apply newly learned skills to overcome common life obstacles, such 
as work stress. The BREATHE videos use this format and incorporate age-appropriate examples 
such as anxiety about engaging in exercise, health -promoting activities, financial worries, and 
worries about one’s own health and health of family members rather than vignettes about work, school, and interpersonal concerns that are less relevant to older adults (e.g., Gould & 
Edelstein, 2010). The combination of experiential and observational learning will help 
participants apply the skills learned in treatment to situations encountered in daily life. 
Vignettes will be used to model these behaviors aligned with Social Learning Theory. Our 
preliminary studies refined the BREATHE program for older Vet erans  (Gould et al., 2017) .  
 
4. Study Summary and Aims  
4.1 Summary.  The present study is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_673491] (psychoeducation ) in older Veterans with an anxiety disorder .  The study will last [ADDRESS_910023] of four weeks of treatment (weekly video lessons ) and two 
months of home practice ( in the case of BREATHE) . Two primary  outcomes will be evaluated: 
anxiety, measured with the Geriatric  Anxiety  Scale  (GAS; Segal, June, Payne, Coolidge & 
Yochim, 2010) , and functioning, measured with the Activity Card Sort  (Baum & Edwards, 
2008) . The specific aims for the study are as follows: 
 
(1) To determine whether BREATHE leads to a statistically greater reduction in anxiety symptoms compared with an active control (psychoeducation) in a 
randomized control trial (RCT) of 60 older Veterans (based on power analysis).  
 
(2) To determine whether BREATHE  resulted in better functioning compared with 
an active control (psychoeducation) in the RCT.  
 
To address aims 1a and 1b, older Veterans with anxiety disorders (Generalized Anxiety, Panic, 
Social Phobia, and other specified anxiety disorder) will be recruited for a RCT in years [ADDRESS_910024] primary outcome, anxiety, will be measured 
with the Geriatric Anxiety Scale (aim 1a). The second primary outcome, functioning, will be 
measured with a modified version of the Activity  Card Sort (aim 1b). BREATHE is hypothesized to 
result in a statistical reduction of anxiety symptoms (1a) and statistical improvement in 
functioning (1b) at post treatment compared with the control condition. The Hamilton Anxiety Scale (Ham ilton, 1959)  and VR -12 will be included as secondary outcome measures.  
5. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria  
Gould CDA Study 3 Protocol   3 5.1 Inclusion Criteri a. Veterans of any gender  aged 60 and older who meet DSM -5 criteria for an 
anxiety disorder(s) (Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Panic Dis order, Agoraphobia, Social Anxiety 
Disorder or Other Specified/ Unspecified Anxiety Disorder or Anxiety Disorder Other Specified). 
Participants must understand English well  enough to participate in treatment.  
 
5.2 Exclusion Criteria.  Comorbid psychiatric disorders are acceptable unless participant has a 
psychotic disorder or serious mental illness (bipolar disorder). Participants with dementia or 
cognitive impairment, defined as a score of [ADDRESS_910025] ( SBT; Katzman 
et al., 1983) will be excluded. Participants enrolled in other psychological or pharmacological 
treatment studies for psychiatric conditions will be excluded. If participants are taking 
psychotropic medications and are not on a stable dose for at least 30 days, they will be 
excluded.  
 
6. Study Endpoints: Assessments will occur at baseline, 4 weeks , 8 weeks , and 12 weeks .  
 
7. Study Procedures :  
7.1 Telephone Screen . A telephone interview will be conducted with potential  participants  to 
determine study eligibility. During the interview, study staff will explain the  study, its 
requirements and answer any questions that the  potential  participant has. Upon the potential 
participant's willingness to  be screened, study staff will determine whether patients me et age  
criteria (60+) and cognition exclusion criteria based on  performance  on the Short Blessed Test 
(SBT). The SBT is  a weighted [ADDRESS_910026],  scores of 0 to 5  indicate  normal cognition and scores 6 + suggest the 
presence of cognitive impairment. The SBT is administered to assess for cognitive  impairment, 
an exclusion criterion. The SBT evaluates the  following cognitive domains: orientation, 
registration, attention,  and memory recall. It has acceptable test -retest reliability, convergent  
validity with other cognitive measures, and high specificity and  adequate sensitivity for the 
detection of dementia (Milne et al.,  2008). Any participants who do not pass the SBT (> 6) will be  
excluded from the study at that time. Participants excluded due to  cognitive scores will be 
provided  the feedback that their performance  may suggest the presence of cognitive problems, 
but further  assessment is needed. Referrals will be provided to them at that  time.  Participants 
must also not have a diagnosis of dementia or a serious psychiatric disorder ( psychotic disorder, 
schizophrenia,  schizoaf fective disorder, or bipolar disorder ) as determined by  [CONTACT_673498]. Additional screening questions about medication use (as needed 
benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_2597])  and participating in ongoing psychotherapy (indiv idual or group)  will be  
included. Participants who are deemed to  meet initial inclusion/exclusion criteria for age, 
absence of serious  mental illness, and cognition status will be invited to  participate in a baseline 
assessment including obtaining informed consent to participate.  
 
7.2 Baseline Visit . At the beginning of the face-to -face baseline assessment, written informed 
consent and consent for audiotapi[INVESTIGATOR_673492] -5 (SCID -5; 
First , Williams, Karg, & Spi[INVESTIGATOR_626], 2015) , will be obtained. Audiotapi[INVESTIGATOR_673493] -rater reliability of diagnoses.  During the COVID -[ADDRESS_910027].  
 
Gould CDA Study 3 Protocol   4 The baseline visit is used to both assess for the presence of a current anxiety disorder (i.e., 
diagnosis of Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Social Anxiety Disorder, Panic Anxiety Disorder, 
Agoraphobia, or Unspecified or Other Specified Anxiety Disorder) using the SCID -[ADDRESS_910028] 
baseline data on the primary and secondary outcomes. Assessment of anxiety disorders will be 
completed by [CONTACT_673499] -5. A ll diagnoses will be reviewed with 
the PI [INVESTIGATOR_1660] a Co -Investigator prior to participants being rando mized. Individuals with a previously 
unreported psychotic disorder or bipolar disorder will be excluded from the study at this time (if 
not already excluded  during telephone screen). Participants who  are not eligible or not 
interested in treatment will be provided with referral information for treatment  if they desire.  
 
Following the SCID -5 and completion of the Hamilton Anxiety Scale, participants will complete 
the self -report measures described below (demographic questionnaire, Geriatric Anxiety Scale, 
PROMIS anxiety measure (Reeve et al., 2007) , Anxiety Control Questionnaire (Rapee et al., 
1996) , Veterans Rand -12 item  questionnaire ( Kazis et al., 1999 ), and P atient Health 
Questionnaire-9  (PHQ -9; Kroenke, Spi[INVESTIGATOR_626], & Williams, 2001 ). Finally, the Activity Card Sort (ACS) 
will be administered All participants who participate in the baseline assessment will receive  $60 
compensation for their time. Those participants that meet inclusion/exclusion criteria will be 
randomized to either BREATHE or the psychoeducation condition (Healthy Living for Reduced Anxiety) .  
 Then,  participants will receive materials for their condition. Materials include a DVD video and 
instructions to view the videos on the website. Each condition included a binder with materia ls 
specific to each condition. Portable personal DVD players will be lent to  participants who do not 
have access to a DVD player.  
 
After the baseline assessment is complete, participants assigned to BREATHE will be instructed 
on how to complete Subjec tive Units of Distress Scale (SUDS ; Wolpe (1969)  before and after 
each PMR practice throughout the study. SUDS ratings ranging from 0 to 100 (least to most 
distressed) have been used to document a patient’s subjective experience during anxiety 
disor der treatments such as systematic desensitization and trauma- focused therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. This 
measure was selected to track anxiety (0 = no anxiety, 100 = extreme anxiety) before and after 
practicing PMR. This is an important part of the clinical intervention in t hat it draws the patient’s 
attention to the changes in anxiety following the PMR intervention. SUDS may help monitor 
homework compliance and identify problems, such as relaxation-induced anxiety.  
 
 
7.3 Measures . In the baseline demographic questionnaire , basic participant characteristics including 
gender, marital status, race, and ethnicity will be coll ected. Additional questions about 
participants’ previous experience with relaxation, breathing training, meditation, Tai chi, and 
any other similar techniqu es will be assessed. The information needed about medical conditions 
to complete the Deyo -adjusted  Charlson Comorbidity Index (Charlson, Pompei, & MacKenzie, 
1987) will come f rom the comorbidity questions (Katz et al., 1996) about medication conditions 
on the demographic questionnaire.  
 The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 Disorders (SCID -5; First , Williams, Karg, & Spi[INVESTIGATOR_626], 
2015)  is a structured interview that assess diagnostic cr iteria each DSM -5 disorder. The 
interview can take 90 to 120 minutes. The SCID -5 is included to assess inclusion and exclusion 
criteria.  
Gould CDA Study 3 Protocol   5  
Geriatric Anxiety Scale (GAS ; Segal et al., 2010).  The GAS is a [ADDRESS_910029] 25 items of the m easure are used to 
compute the total score; the last 5 items provide information about the content of worries or fears. Participants provide severity ratings for items using on a four -point Likert -type scale. The 
GAS is administered to assess severity of anxiety symptoms and is the primary outcome in this study.  
 
The Patient Health Questionnaire -9 (PHQ -9; Kroenke, Spi[INVESTIGATOR_626], & Williams, 2001 ) is a 9 -item 
depression assessment rated on a four -point Likert -type scale with scores ranging from 0 to 27.  
The PHQ-9  is administered to characterize participants’ depression symptoms.  
 
PROMIS Anxiety  7 item anxiety scale (Reeve et al., 2007)  is included to assess anxiety 
symptoms. This measure will be used to quantify the severity of anxiety symptoms. The benefit 
of using this measure i s that it is valid for older and younger adults and the findings can be used 
to compare and contrast our cohort to other studies in the literature.  
Anxiety Control Questionnaire  (ACQ ; Rapee et al., 1996 ) is a 30 - item self -report measure 
assessing one's perceived ability to  control anxiety -evoking situations and emotional reactions 
to these situations. This measure assess es aspects of avoidance and was included to examine 
whether BREATHE has an effect on perceived  anxiety co ntrol compared with the 
psychoeducation control  condition.  
 
Hamilton Anxiety Scale  (HAM -A; Hamilton, 1959 ) is a clinician-administered  rating scale, 
assesses the severity of anxiety using  14-items rated on a five -point scale. The Structured 
Interview  Guide for Hamilton Anxiety Scale ( Shear et al., 2001) provides  descriptive anchors to 
guide clinician decision making ratings  based on both frequency and severity.  
 
Activity Card Sort (ACS ; Baum & Edwards, 2008).  The ACS contains [ADDRESS_910030] 
the performance of instrumental activities, low -physical -demand leisure activities, high -physical -
demand leisure activities, and social activities. The ACS was selected as a measure of activity engagement for the present study because it assesses the presence and the loss of activity. We will administer the ACS using an interactive sorting task (Q -sort procedure; Albert et al., 2009). 
Participants will be asked to divide the stack of photographs into  pi[INVESTIGATOR_673494]. Then, participants will divide the stack of activities that are currently not performed into two additional pi[INVESTIGATOR_108726]: “never -performed” 
and “used -to-but-no-longer - perform” activities. For the stack of activities that are curr ently 
performed, these will be divided into “hard-to -do” and “easy -to-do” activities based on a time 
frame of “today or the past 30 days.”  
 The four pi[INVESTIGATOR_673495] -adjusted function (Albert et al., 2009). By 
[CONTACT_673500], the lifestyle -adjusted function score will 
accurately reflect loss, gain, or changes in activity participation. We also have participants select 
their top five activities that they would like to do more frequently if not  experiencing anxiety. 
Participants will make ratings of these measures before and after treatment.  
 
Veterans RAND Health Survey  (VR-12; Kazis et al., 1999 ) is a 12 -item measure assessing mental 
and physical health and functioning.  
Gould CDA Study 3 Protocol   6  
Cumulative Illness Rating Scale for Geriatrics  (CIRS -G; Miller & Towers, 1991 ). The CIRS -G was 
selected to measure comorbidity. The measure will be completed based on the demographic 
questionnaire responses and based on a medical record review. Research assistants have used 
retrospective scoring with the CIRS -G to obtain inter -rater  ICC of .81 ( Salvi et al., 2008 ).  
 
7.4 Study Design.  The objectives will be addressed with a  12-week randomized control trial (RCT) 
that compares a 4 -week treatment, BREATHE (described below), and 8 -week  follow -up period , 
with a psychoeducation  control  (Healthy Living) . All participants will be offered the option to 
enroll in the alternative treatment  after the post -treatment assessment.  
 
7.5 Randomization . Participants will be randomized to BREATHE or psychoeducation . A statistician 
will create a randomization scheme with varying sized blocks  and a researcher/evaluator 
independent from the study team will take the randomization scheme and enclose the assign ments in sealed envelopes that are sequentially numbered. At the baseline visit, the study 
coordinator, evaluator, or the PI [INVESTIGATOR_673496].  
 7.[ADDRESS_910031] -protected website along with weekly telephone check -ins. The 
videos teach two behavioral interventions: diaphragmatic breathing and progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) as described ear lier in the background section. Participants will receive a 
telephone call from study staff on a weekly basis to check in about problems with the videos or the intervention. Participants will be instructed to complete one module a week. Each module 
consist s of a lesson video and a video to be used to guide daily practices. Participants will 
receive a telephone call from study staff (i.e., BREATHE coach) on a weekly basis to check in 
about problems with the videos or the intervention. Participants will be as ked to report the 
number of times they practiced relaxation and their SUDS ratings before and after the PMR 
practice during weekly telephone check ins. Each weekly video lesson will consist of brief 
psychoeducation, teaching of new skills, and assigned home practice. The content of the weekly 
sessions is available from the PI [INVESTIGATOR_673497] (Gould et al., 2017; 2019). At the end 
of the BREATHE treatment (week 4), participants will be asked to complete  the telephone 
assessment as described below.  
7.7 Psychoeducation Intervention. Like the BREATHE group, the psychoeducation group (Healthy 
Living for  Reduced Anxiety) will receive weekly telephone calls to provide  technological 
assistance and other trouble shooting during weeks 1  through 4 . The forma t of Healthy Living  
will be similar to BREATHE in that  there are 20 to 35- minute video lessons viewed by 
[CONTACT_673501] a week for four weeks. The videos will be primarily lecture  based  with no 
instructions to increase activities  or engage in relaxation. Video content draws from information 
about stress, anxiety, and  aging based on VA and NIA psychoeducational information  and 
videos . Week 1  focuses on what anxiety is and what causes anxiety. Week 2 focuses on  how to 
cope with anxiety and healthy sleep ti ps. Week 3 focuses on healthy living through physical 
activity (walking, gentle  stretching).  Week [ADDRESS_910032] additional readings that correspond to the videos.  
 
Gould CDA Study 3 Protocol   7 7.8 Week 4  and 8  Assessment s. At the end of the 4 -week intervention (BREATHE or 
psychoeducation) , participants will be asked to complete the GAS, PHQ -9, VR -12, and ACS  [5 
activities frequency only] over the telephone. Participants will also be instructed to continue 
with home practice of PMR for four weeks. Participants will be paid $[ADDRESS_910033] -treatment Assessment/ [ADDRESS_910034]  the HAM -A and a 
qualitative interview to seek feedback on the interventions. Participants a re paid $60 for 
completing this assessment.  
 
8 Statistical analyses  
8.8 Baseline analyses . Baseline group means and distributions using χ2 and independent samples t -
tests are compared to determine whether randomization result s in equivalent  groups.  
8.9 Dropouts . We will examin e whether participants completing the study differed from those who 
do not complete the study (i.e., drop -outs) . Efforts are  made to obtain data from individuals 
who discontinue participation.  
8.10 BREATHE Intervention . Engagement with the BREATHE intervention is  examined by [CONTACT_673502] a calculation of relaxation practices completed during the four -week 
intervention phase. The activities that participants engage  in using breathing or PMR skills are  
summarized.  
8.11 Outcome analyses . Mixed effects models are used to examine the primary and secondary 
hypotheses using intent -to-treat principles. Maximum likelihood estimation for missing values 
will be  used in the mixed effects models. In all models, th e fixed factor is treatment type 
(BREATHE vs. Healthy Living ), with four  timepoints ( GAS, VR -12) or two timepoints (ACS lifestyle 
adjusted functioning scores ). Effect sizes are  measured using Hedges’ g to adjust for small 
sample size.

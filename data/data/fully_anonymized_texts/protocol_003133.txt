Protocol #:  16-[ADDRESS_658580] Title:  Evaluation of Moderate to Severe Influenza Disease in Children 6 
months to 8 years in Colorado      
Principal Investigator:  [INVESTIGATOR_509360] , MD  
Version Date:  7/27/16         
 
I. Hypotheses and Specific Aims :   
Children [ADDRESS_658581] a higher risk 
of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], intensive care  unit (ICU)  admission, antibiotic use and complications 
compared with children with mild influenza illness.  
Specific Aims:  
Aim #1:   To determine the validity of the moderate to severe endpoint for influenza as 
a predictor for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_509361] 6 months to 8 years evaluated at 
Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_20161]  (CHCO)  emergency department  (ED) and urgent cares  
(UC)  during the 2016 -2017 influenza season.  
 
Aim #2:  To prospectively evaluate the usefulness of the moderate to severe influenza 
endpoint against additional severity measures such as ICU admission, antibiotic and 
antiviral use, parental and child absenteeism and recurrent healthcare visits among 
children aged 6 months to 8 years evaluated at ED and UC centers in Colorado.  
 
Aim # 3 : To compare the healthcare costs associated with management of moderate 
to severe versus mild influenza disea se. 
Exploratory Objectives:  
1) To compare the moderate to severe influenza definition, and other severity measures 
such as ICU admission, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], antibiotic, antiviral use, child and caregiver 
absenteeism among patients vaccinated with injectable inf luenza vaccine ( IIV) versus 
unvaccinated individuals.  
2) To evaluate severity measures such as hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], ICU admission, antibiotic, 
antiviral use, caregiver and child absenteeism among children with influenza like 
illness who test negative for influen za.  
3) To determine whether clinical measurements taken at ED/UC presentation such as 
systemic inflammatory response syndrome ( SIRS ) criteria, adjusted heart rate, oxygen 
saturation and temperature predict hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], ICU admission and having 
polymerase  chain reaction ( PCR )-confirmed influenza.   We will also consider the 
prediction value of peak temperature and temperature duration.  
II. Background and Significance :  
Influenza is an important cause of morbidity in children, annually causing 1 -7 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8800] 10,000 in US children under the age of 18 years (1-6).  Children are

Page 2 of 16 PI: [INVESTIGATOR_509359], MD/DO  Protocol Version: January /17 
COMIRB# 16-1785  among those at high risk of serious outcomes and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_509362] d 
influenza -related complications (7, 8).  The social and economic impacts of influenza 
range from significant healthcare costs and decreased productivity due to parental 
absenteeism (9).  Annual influenza vaccination is the most effective strategy to prevent 
influenza illness, and is recommended for all children aged greater than 6 months of age.  
The Center for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) estimates that for the 2013 -2014 
influe nza season, influenza vaccination prevented approximately 7.2 million illnesses 
associated with influenza (10).  
 
While the ultimate goal of vaccination is to prevent influenza infection, prevention of 
severe disease would provide the greatest public health impact in terms of benefits to the 
individual and society. Influenza vaccine effectiveness has been traditionally studied 
against lab -confirmed influenza, or  medically -attended illness, but influenza vaccination 
has been shown to be effective in reducing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_509363] (11-14).   
 
More recently, a multicenter, phase 3, randomized controlled quadrivalent influenza 
vaccination study conducted in Asia, Central America and Europe showed that influenza 
vaccination was highly effective in reducing moderate to severe influenza, def ined as 
fever greater than 39 ⁰C, or presence of otitis media defined by [CONTACT_189950] (AAP) guideline criteria, lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092] (shortness of breath, 
pulmonary congestion, pneumonia, bronchiolitis, bronchitis, wheezin g, croup), or serious 
extrapulmonary manifestations (e.g., myocarditis, encephalitis, seizure)  (15). The same 
moderate to severe influenza endpoint has been shown in a Finnish study to be clinically 
meaningful, in terms of illness duration, child and parental absenteeism, and antibiotic use 
(16). However, the relationship between this definition of moderate to sev ere influenza 
and important clinical and public health outcomes such as ED visits, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], ICU 
admission, use of antimicrobials and recurrent health care utilization has not been 
evaluated prospectively in US children.  
 
The purpose of the proposed  study is to validate that the definition of moderate to severe 
influenza in children predicts greater risk of healthcare endpoints such as hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], 
increased length of stay, use of antimicrobials (including antivirals), absenteeism, 
increased dura tion of illness, and increased healthcare costs.  
 
Understanding and validating the relationship between moderate to severe influenza and 
these clinically relevant endpoints is critical to establishing relevant surrogate markers of 
clinical and public heal th outcomes.  If shown to be clinically relevant, this definition of 
moderate to severe influenza can be an important endpoint for assessing influenza 
vaccine effectiveness.  
 
 
III. Preliminary Studies/Progress Report:   
CHCO provides an ideal site for the study of influenza in children.  CHCO is a large 
tertiary institution with a large catchment area of Denver Metro, Aurora and surrounding 
states.  It serves 67% of children in the s tate of Colorado.  From December 1, 2010 to 
April 30, 2014, there were 409 patients admitted to CHCO with  PCR -confirmed influenza; 
62% of these were defined as high -risk (16), and 38% were vaccinated against influenza 
during the same season. Accurate immunization data was availa ble for 83% of patients 
via the Colorado Immunization Information System  (CIIS) . Clinical presentation and

COMIRB# 16-1785  Surveillance Methods : 
The study group will review the CHCO Main ED or North Campus UC  visits for patients 
meeting study criteria presenting with ILI.   Screening will be conducted by [CONTACT_509395] (PRAs) at each site. The study team has a treatment 
relationship with potential subjects, since one of the co -investigators is an ED physician, 
thus enabling screening of potentia l patients. The parents/ legal guardians of eligible 
patients will be approached for consent to obtain respi[INVESTIGATOR_509372], 
interviewed to obtain medical information pertaining to the current and future ILI visits, 
asked permission to obta in additional information (vaccination status, influenza 
vaccination type [LAIV ] or IIV) and medical comorbidities) from the primary care provider, 
and to bank residual blood and respi[INVESTIGATOR_135608].  A memory aid  card will be provided 
to the family member  upon discharge from the ED/ UC setting as an aide memoire, and 
the medical chart will be reviewed for additional clinical and demographic information.  On 
day 14 (+/-3) following the initial visit,  caregivers of all participants who  test positive for  
influenza will be contact[CONTACT_509396] -up information regarding 
child and parental absenteeism, additional healthcare visits, duration of illness.  
Additionally , a random sample of participants whose influenza  test is negative in a 1  to 4 
ratio will be contact[CONTACT_51095] -up.  A second chart review will occur at this time for 
details regarding additional visits or admissions.  Data will be managed with REDCap 
(Research Electronic Data Capture) tools hosted at the University of Colorado (19) and 
exported to SAS 9.3 (Cary, NC) for statistical analyses.

Specimen Testing :  
Nasal  (NP) swabs will be obtained for testing by [CONTACT_423087]/medical staff.  If a 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_509373], this will 
replace the study NP swab , and no additional testing will be required.   Influenza testing 
will be conducted at the microbiology lab at CHCO .  Testing is conducted using the 
Cepheid Xpert® influenza real time RT - PCR. This test detects influenza A and influenza 
B and provides the influenza A [ADDRESS_658584] has sens itivity 
of 100% and specificity of 95 -100%, (depending on the influenza strain).  Specific data 
regarding the excellent sensitivity and specificity of the test is available at:

COMIRB# 16-1785  Once testing has occ urred, family members will be given a number to call (PRA phone 
number) if they would like to have results of  the influenza PCR test .  If the flu test is being 
performed for clinical purposes we will use that result.   
 
Biobanking of Samples :  
We will obtain consent from parents /legal guardians regarding banking residual 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_509374] .  All left -over blood 
(whole blood, serum, and plasma) samples collected for clinical purposes will be stored in 
the CHCO CTRC lab (depending on the assay and sample) in case repeat or additional 
testing is requested. These samples can be used for future research after they have been 
discharged from care.   
 
D.   Description, Risks and Justification of Proc edures and Data Collection 
Tools:  
 
Description, risks and justification of procedures :  
Respi[INVESTIGATOR_509375] a nasopharyngeal (NP) FLOQSwab and 
placed in Universal Transport Media (Copan Diagnostics Inc., Murrieta, CA).  NP swabs 
will be collected for study purposes.  If a respi[INVESTIGATOR_509376], these will be used for testing, and no 
additional testing will be required.   NP swabs, nasal washes or nasopharyngeal samples 
will be permitted for the study. This source is cleared by [CONTACT_509397][INVESTIGATOR_509377] (RPP) and the collection method is standard clinical and research practice 
at our institution.  We have successfully used this system to collect leftover clinical 
specimens for a number of previous and ongoing studies.  Risks of  the procedure are 
minimal, and include mild local discomfort at the time of specimen collection.   
 
Data collection tools :  
Study data will be collected and managed using REDCap (Research Electronic Data 
Capture). REDCap is a secure web application design ed to support data capture for 
research studies, providing user -friendly web -based case report forms, real -time data 
entry validation (e.g. for data types and range checks), audit trails and a de -identified data 
export mechanism to common statistical packa ges (SPSS, SAS, Stata, R/S -Plus).  
 
The system was developed by a multi -institutional consortium which includes University of 
Colorado –Denver and was initiated at Vanderbilt University. The database is hosted at the 
University of Colorado –Denver Development and Informatics Service Center (DISC), 
which will be used as a central location for data processing and management. REDCap 
data collection projects rely on a thorough study -specific data dictionary defined in an 
iterative self -documenting process by [CONTACT_509398]. This iterative development and testing process results in a 
well-planned data collection strategy for individual studies. REDCap also includes a 
powerful tool fo r building and managing online surveys. The research team can create 
and design surveys in a web browser and engage potential respondents using a variety of 
notification methods. REDCap is flexible enough to be used for a variety of types of 
research and p rovides an intuitive user interface for database and survey design and data 
entry.

relationship to any patient identifying information.  The legend will be maintained until data 
editing is complete, and then the link will be destroyed.  During the stud y period, the 
legend will be stored in a secure manner in a locked room with limited access, and 
computerized data will be similarly maintained in a secure fashion by [CONTACT_509399].  Data will only be publicly presented in aggregate form.  This mi nimizes the risks 
related to invasion of privacy and breach of confidentiality.      
E.   Potential Scientific Problems:   
A potential limitation of the study is potential selection bias due to the inability to test all 
patients who present with ILI to the  ED.  This is due to a high volume of patients 
presenting to the ED, as shown in Table 1.  We will select patients based on age, restrict 
the season to once the influenza season has commenced, and will attempt to include all 
patients during this time perio d, which aims to avoid the skewing of data to more patients 
with co -morbidities or higher severity of illness who will undergo testing during routine 
clinical care.  
 
There is also a possibility for recall bias regarding vaccination status and other medical  
history obtained from the parents /legal  guardians.  We will verify this information with the 
electronic medical record, which is linked to the CIIS.  The CIIS is a lifelong immunization 
record tracking system managed by [CONTACT_509400] H ealth and 
Environment (CDPHE). Approximately 85% of Colorado primary care practices utilize the 
registry. In addition, if vaccination status cannot be determined from the electronic medical 
record, a member of the study team will contact [CONTACT_509401] ( PCP) for 
vaccination information. The combination of verification from the PCP as well as the CIIS 
registry will increase the accuracy of influenza vaccination status.  
 
The study may have limited external validity and cannot provide populat ion-based 
estimates of moderate to severe influenza, given its design.  
 
F.   Data Analysis Plan:   
For all study objectives, we will present data descriptively using frequencies for 
categorical variables and measures of central tendency for continuous var iables. We will 
explore bivariable associations between moderate to severe versus mild influenza for 
covariates including demographic factors and clinical factors outlined above. Proportions 
will be compared using Chi -square test. Mean values will be compa red using student’s t 
test for normally -distributed data, otherwise Wilcoxon -Rank -Sum test will be used.    
 
Aim #1 /Primary Endpoint  Analysis : We will use logistic regression to estimate odds ratios 
(and 95%CI) for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], adjusted for significant  covariates at the level of P < 0.2 
on bivariable analysis; and other covariates selected a priori  that could affect outcomes 
such as hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (age group, high risk medical condition, vaccination status, 
influenza type).  We will verify to ensure statistical assumptions are met for each model.  
The intraclass correlation coefficient will be esti mated and a multi -level model will be used 
if we need to account for multiple visits per child. If we use a multi -level model, the optimal 
covariance structure will be determined through the examination of information criteria 
statistics and graphical tech niques.    
 
Aim #2/Secondary Endpoint #1 -6 Analysis:  We will use logistic regression to estimate 
each of our dichotomous secondary outcomes of interest, ICU admission, antibiotic,

COMIRB# 16-1785  antiviral use, adjusted for significant covariates at the level of P < 0.2 o n bivariable 
analysis; and other covariates selected a priori  that could affect outcomes such as 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (age group, high risk medical condition, vaccination status, influenza type).  
We will verify to ensure statistical assumptions are met for eac h model. The intraclass 
correlation coefficient will be estimated and a multi -level model will be used if we need to 
account for multiple visits per child.   If we use a multi -level model, the optimal covariance 
structure will be determined through the exa mination of information criteria and graphical 
techniques.  We will also explore our secondary outcomes of interest expressed as 
continuous variables (number of recurrent visits to the ED, duration of absenteeism in 
days). We will use a log linear model to  compare these variables between  the mild versus 
moderate to severe influenza groups and will exponentiate the coefficients to yield 
geometric mean ratios.    
 
Aim #3/Secondary Endpoint #7 Analysis:  An economic analysis will be conducted to 
compare the heal thcare costs in the mild and moderate to severe influenza groups.  We 
will work with the finance department at CHCO to obtain charge data for each influenza -
related ED visit and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. Direct costs associated with healthcare utilization will 
be obtained by [CONTACT_509402][INVESTIGATOR_509378] a cost to charge ratio to 
estimate costs.  Mean costs and standard deviations for each group will be determined 
and compared using t tests for normally distributed data, and presented as median (IQR) 
costs with analysis conducted using non parametric tests for non -normally distributed 
data.  Relative healthcare costs will be modeled on log -transformed data using linear 
regression or a generalized linear model, depending on the data distribution.  
 
Explo ratory Objective #1 -2/Exploratory Endpoints #1 -2: In addition to the primary and 
secondary outcomes outlined above, we will also assess the odds ratios and 95% CI of 
several exploratory dichotomous outcomes –moderate to severe influenza, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], 
ICU admission, antibiotics and antiviral use among patients with IIV versus unvaccinated 
children using log linear regression in a manner similar to the above specific aims.  For 
continuous variables (duration of fever, number of days of absenteeism), we wi ll use a log 
linear model as described for our prior secondary outcomes.    
We will conduct a similar analysis as outlined above for patients with influenza like illness 
who test negative for influenza using the clinical severity outcome measures outlined.   
 
Exploratory Objective #3/ Exploratory Endpoint#3:  We will determine the predictive value 
for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], ICU admission and having PCR -confirmed influenza of duration of 
fever, SIRS criteria, adjusted heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_509379] -way interactio ns between factors in the model when 
needed.  We will use the Brier score to assess overall model performance and the c 
statistic to assess discriminative ability.  In addition to logistic regression, we will explore 
machine learning methods for the predic tive modeling of these three outcomes.  The 
predictive value of peak temperature will also be assessed using a logistic regression 
model.   
 
To compare temperature trajectories between hosp italized and non -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], we will 
use a linear mixed model.   This will allow us to use all of the longitudinal temperature 
measurements to measure the mean temperature trajectory of patients in one group ( e.g. 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9643]) compared to the ot her (e.g. non-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9643]).   We will 
accomplish this by [CONTACT_509403][INVESTIGATOR_30070], 
which will give us hospi[INVESTIGATOR_30070] -specific trajectories.   We will do this for each

COMIRB# 16-1785  dichotomous outcome: hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1916], ICU status, influenza diagnosis.   This method is 
preferred over subgroup analysis because it will optimize statistical power.  
 
Two sensitivity analyses will be conducted.  Firstly, analyses will be restricted to patients 
presenting to the main CHCO ED. Secondly, to further evaluate whether temperature > 
39⁰C is a predictor of healthcare utilization or poorer outcomes, an analysis of each of the 
secondary outcome measures will be conducted.  Firstly, we will compare all moderate to 
severe ve rsus mild influenza cases.  If these reach statistical significance with an odds 
ratio >1, we will then repeat the analysis with a definition of moderate to severe influenza 
as solely temperature > 39 ⁰C.  
 
 
Power and sample size calculations : 
Using historical data from our institution, a sample size of  408 patients (of which we 
assume 30% have mild flu and 70% have moderate/severe flu) will achieve 80% power at 
a 0.[ADDRESS_658586] an odds ratio of approximately 2  for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_509380]/severe compared to the mild cases, accounting for the inclusion of 
correlated covariables in our multivariable model.   Assuming that 25% of patients tested 
will be influenza positive (19) during the influenza season;  we will need to  test 
approximately  1632  subjects (Figure 1).  A sample size of  [ADDRESS_658587] an odds ratio of 3 for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_509381]/severe compared with mild cases, so  604 subjects will  need to be 
tested.   
 
Using these sample size estimates (using sample size of  408), assuming 50% vaccination 
status, and a ratio of IIV to LAIV receipt among vaccinated individuals of 9:1, we will 
have  80% power at a 0.[ADDRESS_658588] an o dds ratio of 3 for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_509382], among patients vaccinated with IIV. 
 We won't be adequately powered to detect a statistically significant difference for LAIV 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].

G.  Summarize Knowledge to be Gained:   
Influenza is an important public health and clinical challenge, and contributes to a 
significant burden of disease among children.  Understanding and validating the 
relationship between moderate to severe influenza and clinically relevant endpoints such 
as ED visits, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_509383].  If shown to be clinically 
relevant, this definition of moderate to severe influenza can be an important endpoint  for 
assessing influenza vaccine effectiveness.

 Rational and Background Information  
Older Asian American adults  (> 65)  are a rapi[INVESTIGATOR_852960]/ethnic group in the [LOCATION_002], in which their 
total population is expected to nearly double from [ADDRESS_1186850] ed of isolation, quarantine, social distancing, and community containment. While the 
preventive strategies lower the risks for exposure, these strategies pose challenge s for older adults who already 
experience isolation due to diminishing social network. For older AA & NHPI  [CONTACT_67022], these experiences are further 
magnified due to language barriers to accessing information and limited ability to network with culturally relevant 
groups. Furthermore, a survey on life satisfaction indicated that Asian American olde r adults reported lower 
satisfaction and high er unmet social and emotional needs than other race and ethnicities .1Finally, i ncreased racism 
since the pandemic poses another layer of complexity  for Asian American  older adults.  
Public health efforts have repeatedly marginalized older Asians’ mental health needs through systematic exclusion 
of non -English/Spanish speakers in national surveys. Limited English proficiency (LEP) is a term used to describe 
individuals who do not speak English as their primary language and who have limited ability to read, speak, write, 
or understand English.2 According to the 2010 Census, more than 18% of the U.S. population (47 million Americans) 
do not speak English as their primary language, and more  than 25 million speak English less than “very well.”[ADDRESS_1186851] group with LEP status after Hispanics.3 Approximately 89% of older Asian 
Americans are foreign -born, and 62% are LEP, with 84% of Vietnamese and Koreans reporting LEP.4 The LEP 
population experiences higher burdens in health and access to care compared to their English -speaking 
counterparts, but surveys do not always capture these disparities.5-8 For example, the prevalence of depression 
using data from the Nation al Health and Nutrition Exami nation survey (NHANES) shows lower reports of depression 
(3.1%) among older Asians compared to non -Hispanic Whites (7.9%), Hispanics (8.2%), and non -Hispanic Blacks 
(9.2%).9 NHANES is in English and Spanish only . When a large study (n=175,956) attempted to include survey 
reminders in Chinese, depressive symptoms among older Asians (11% –21%) were greater than non -Hispanic 
Whites (9%), non -Hispanic Blacks (16%), and similar to Hispanics (17% –23%).10 Depression rates drastically 
escalated to 44% when surveys (n=2,609) were administered in five Asian languages  (Asian Indian, Chinese, 
Filipi[INVESTIGATOR_8614], Korean, and Vietnamese), with 55% of Vietnamese reporting depression.[ADDRESS_1186852] prominent factor for lower mental health service use and increased unmet mental 
health needs among older Asians.11 This methodologic limitation suggests that the burden of depression among 
non-English/Spanish speaking older Asian adults is not represented in the national health profiles of the U.S. 
population, and our current knowledge may be a small glimpse of a much larger health issue .   
 
Mindfulness -based cognitive therapy ( MBCT) is a group -based intervention rooted in Eastern ideology but taught 
from a secular perspective.[ADDRESS_1186853] among older Asian 
Americans remain understudied.  
 
We will collaborate with a community -based organization named Asian American Resource and Information 
Network (AARIN) to implement an MBCT intervention with older Korean adults.  This is a collaborative project 
between AARIN and  the University of Washington  (UW) will recruit [ADDRESS_1186854] program delivered by [CONTACT_852962].   
Specific Aims  
1) To implement the mindfulness -based cognitive therapy (MBCT) intervention.  
4 | P a g e  
 
 2)  To assess the acceptability and relevance of MBCT, as well as its impact on patient reported outcomes  among 
older Korean  adults , ages [ADDRESS_1186855] a single arm, pre/post pi[INVESTIGATOR_852961] .  We will recruit older Korean  adults (n=40) from AARIN  to complete the 8 -
session Healthy Mind , Healthy Living intervention , along with periodic mental health assessments.  
 
Eligibility Criteria  
Inclusion criteria:  To be eligible, the participants must : (1) self -identify as a Korean person, (2) be b etween the ages 
505 and 89, (3) has mild to moderate depressive symptoms (scores between 5 -14 when assessed using Patient 
Health Questionnaire -9 (PHQ -9), (4) has limited English proficiency (responds “less than very well” when asked 
“how well do you speak English”?)  and fluency in Korean (e.g. able to speak at a native level) , and (5) willing to 
give a written consent to participate in the study.  
Exclusion criteria include : Individuals will not be able to participate if they have any of the following criteria:  (1) major 
psychiatric diseases  that would interfere with participants’ ability to participate in or receive the benefit from the 
mental health interventions  (e.g., bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, recent history of psychosis or mania, severe 
depressive symptoms ); (2) used drugs other than those required for medical reasons ; (3) serious medical conditions 
(e.g., poorly controlled diabetes, seve re congestive heart failure) that ha s not been stable for at least 3 months ; (4) 
current active suicidal or self -injurious behavior, potential ly necessitating immediate treatment ; (5) general 
conditions that would impede participation in a group intervention (e.g., cognitive impairment, tendencies toward 
physical aggression); (6) prior history of engaging in formal mindfulness -based interventions including mindfulness -
based stress reduction, MBCT, Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, and Dialectical Behavioral Therapy; and ( 7) 
significant current meditation practice, specifically more than  three hours  of insight/mindfulness/vipassana 
meditation per week.  
Participant Recruitment  
AARIN will recruit older Korean Adults through partnering organizations, social media, such as Kakao Talk which 
is a popular messaging application among Korean Americans.  
The AARIN staff  will collaborate with partnering organizations to send a study flyer  (APPENDIX A  – HMHL Study 
Flyer ) to potential participants. AARIN staff will recruit participants directly from  partnering organizations  by 
[CONTACT_852963].  AARIN staff  will also ask the partnering 
organizations  to refer their  potential clients who show interest in participating in the study . Potential participants 
will share their contact [CONTACT_852964].   
[CONTACT_6321] will call potential participants, speaking in the language of their preference (English or Korean), to describe 
the study and gauge their interest in participating in the study and their eligibility (APPENDIX B – Phone Scripts) . 
Depending on the participant’s capability, enrollment will take place in person, or via zoom/phone. After the eligibility 
of the participant is confirmed, [CONTACT_6321] will present the Consent Information. Though this study will have a waiver 
of written documentation of consent, [CONTACT_6321] will still read through the Consent Information which includes key 
information about the study. [CONTACT_6321] will verify that that the participant has heard the Consent Information, was able 
to ask questions, and has agreed to partici pate in the study . [CONTACT_6321]  will administer the screener, present the 
Consent Information, and administer the Baseline Survey for those eligible and willing to participate. The consent 
process will be documented in REDCap.  (APPENDIX D – Study Consent & Baseline Variables ; APPENDIX E – 
HMHL Screening & Consent SOP ).  
Consent  
Since this study is considered “minimal risk” it is exempt from requiring the  written documentation of consent. 
However, the study staff will still present participants with the key information required for informed consent.  
5 | P a g e  
 
 In-person Consent  Information  
[CONTACT_6321] will read through a hard copy of the Consent Information with the participant and answer any questions 
that arise. If the participant has no questions and agrees to participate, [CONTACT_6321] will mark an “X” on  the Consent 
Information document to verify the participant has agreed to participate. [CONTACT_6321] will track this process and update 
the participants Consent Information document in REDCap when she uploads the other survey responses. The 
participant will keep a copy of the Consent Information fo r themselves.   
Online  or Phone Consent  Information  
Prior to the enrollment session, participants enrolling via phone /zoom and who use email will receive an email 
with the Consent Information  in their preferred language , those who do not use email will receive it via mail.  If the 
screener is administered via phone/zoom, participants will provide verbal consent to confirm their participation in 
the study. The consent document will be read to the participants by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Lee once their eligibility has been 
confirmed through the adm inistration of the screener. If th e enrollment is taking place over zoom, the participant 
will visually see a copy of the Consent Information on the screen through REDCap as the study staff member 
reads the Consent Information and answers questions. If it is administered via phone, [CONTACT_6321]  will read the 
Consent Information to the participant in the participants preferred language. If the participant has no questions, 
[CONTACT_6321] will verbally confirm that the study participant agrees to participate and check’s the “agree to participate” 
in REDC ap and mark the document with an “X”  to verify the participant has given verbal permission to participate. 
If a participant indicates they would like to receive the Consent Information via email, REDCap will automatically 
send the participant a copy of the Consent Information to their designated email address. If they would prefer to 
receive a paper copy of the Consent Information, the document will be mailed to them at their given address.

HMHL Intervention  
A telephone -based MBCT  will be delivered by [CONTACT_852965]. Prior to the delivery of the MBCT t he staff  
members  at AARIN will be trained by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Visvanathan, a certified MBCT instructor  and developer of  the remote -
delivered  MBCT protocol . The training will include 1) experiential training  from participating in the [ADDRESS_1186858] 
intervention, 2) didactic training  on how to deliver the intervention (how to lead meditations and cognitive exercises 
6 | P a g e  
 
 and conduct participants inquiry), and 3) supervision  as the staff member at AARIN  lead their first [ADDRESS_1186859] includ ing: (1) learning mindfulness skills; (2) practicing mindfulness 
skills in class and at home; and (3) dialogue and inquiry. All sessions will be audio -recorded to allow the staff at 
AARIN  to access them later as a resource.  
 
  
 
[CONTACT_852968] will also provide weekly supervision. We will ensure fidelity by [CONTACT_218985], session 
fidelity checklists, and weekly supervision of session audio recordings to minimize drift. Treatment fidelity will be 
evaluated by [CONTACT_203956], with a minimum of 85% inter -rater reliability, using the Remote -Delivered 
MBCT -Treatment Adherence Competence Scale (MBCT -TACS).[ADDRESS_1186860] sessions with 8 participants per group (n=40).     
 
Data Collection  
Individual participants’ mental health status will be assessed at pre and post MBCT delivery  using PHQ -9 and quick 
inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (QIDS) across all conditions  (APPENDIX F – Follow -up survey . At the 
end of the study, we will conduct semi -structured interviews with [ADDRESS_1186861] for older Korean adults  (APPENDIX G – Semi -structured Interview Guide ).   
Survey data of participants  include depressive symptoms, immigrant stress, sleep quality, socio -demographic 
characteristics, major chronic diseases, healthcare,  beliefs on mental health,  and medications. All measures will be 
collected using validated standardized measures.

Data Analysis  
Survey data Analysis : All analyses will be done in SAS Version 9.4. We will generate frequencies for categorical 
variables and means for continuous variables.  To assess the effect of MBCT,  we will compare depressi on outcomes  
pre/post using T -test. A two -sided test with a level of 0.05 will be used .  
 
Semi -structured Interview Data Analysis : Transcripts will be uploaded  into ATLAS.ti  Version 8. Two analysts will 
use an inductive, constant comparison approach, in which concepts will be identified and themes derived from 
interview data. Using an iterative process, two analysts will meet weekly to refine the codebook, adding, removing, 
and revising codes, as needed, to address inter -rater agreement and to compare new data with existing data. We 
will build consensus around themes that are identified throughout the coding and analysis process. We will compare 
the themes arising from the dat a and determine possible linkages across participants and thematic categories.

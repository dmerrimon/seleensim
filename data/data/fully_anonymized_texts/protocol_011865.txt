CONFIDENTIAL 7 Version 1.8 PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS 
 
Title: A Phase II Trial of TAS-102 in P reviously Treated  Unresectable or 
Metastatic Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Lung 
Rationale: One of the oldest antineoplastic agents available, 5-FU, has so me 
activity against NSCLC. Capecita bine is an oral prodrug which i s 
converted into 5-FU and its active metabolites, and has modest activity 
against NSCLC in combination w ith carboplatin. To date, there h ave 
only been three reports of the oral 5-FU prodrug UFT (uridine a nd 
ftorafur) administered to patients with NSCLC. In two small ser ies a, 
low response rate was observed, although low doses of UFT were 
used. In the third trial, UFT was administered as post-surgical  
adjuvant therapy, and was associ ated with a statistically signi ficant 
increase in 5-year survival. S-1 is a separate 5-FU prodrug whi ch has 
activity in non-small cell lung cancer, and is approved in Japa n for the 
treatment of NSCLC, either alone or in combination with a plati num 
based therapy. S-1 is composed of tegafur (the 5-FU prodrug); 5 -
chloro-2, 4-dihydroxypyridine (CDHP ), which reversibly inhibits  5-
FU degradation by [CONTACT_571962] (DPD); and potassium oxonate which blocks the phosphorylation of 5-FU with in 
the gastrointestinal tract and reduces gastrointestinal toxicit ies. TAS-
[ADDRESS_751094] spectrum of huma n 
tumor cell lines, including non-small cell lung cancer, especia lly the 
squamous cell variant. To date, there are no reports of a clini cal 
evaluation of this agent in NSC LC, as is proposed here. This pr otocol 
will evaluate squamous cell NS CLC; nonsquamous cell NSCLC 
(adenocarcinomas, large cell car cinomas, and poorly differentia ted 
p63-negative carcinomas) will not be evaluated in this protocol  due to 
the potential for differential ex pression of thymidine kinase a nd 
thymidine phosphorylase by [CONTACT_329190] y and the preclinical eviden ce for 
a lower level of cytotoxicity in those histologic variants. The  d i r e  
outcome of patients with unresec table and/or metastatic non-sma ll cell 
lung cancer with currently availabl e therapi[INVESTIGATOR_571944]. 
Study Schema: Drugs / Doses / Length of Treatment Upon confirmation of eligibility and provision of written infor med 
consent, subjects will receive TAS-102 (Lonsurf
®) at its FDA-
approved dose and schedule, 35 mg/m2 up to a maximum of 80 mg per 
dose (based on the trifluridine c omponent) orally twice daily w ithin 
UF-STO-LUNG-[ADDRESS_751095] cycle for tolerance, and tumor status will be assesse d every 
other cycle. Participants will continue on therapy until the 
development of unacceptable toxicity, disease progression, or participant desire to discontinue protocol therapy. 
Objectives: Primary Objective: 
 To determine the percentage of subjects who achieve an 
objective response by [CONTACT_571963]: 
 To evaluate the qualitative and quantitative toxicities, and 
reversibility of toxicities, o f this treatment by [CONTACT_571964] 4.0.3 criteria 
 To determine the progression-free survival, in months, of 
subjects receiving TAS-102 for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic recurrent s quamous cell lung cancers 
 To determine the percentage of subjects who derive clinical 
benefit (objective response + stable disease) 
 To determine the median duration of responses in months 
 To determine the overall survival in months  
 To determine the percentage of expression of thymidine kinase 
and thymidine phosphorylase 
Study Design: Non-randomized, open label, seque ntially enrolling phase II stu dy 
with a Simon two-step enrollment design. 
Accrual Goal: Up to 30 subjects 
Inclusion 
Criteria: Patients must fulfill all of the following criteria to be eligi ble for study 
entry:  Those who will be eligible will be all patients with unresectab le and/or 
metastatic squamous cell non-small cell lung cancer who have di sease 
which has been previously treated with an FDA- or NCCN-approved  
platinum doublet. Patients who ha ve not received such therapy m ust 
have medical reasons for not rece iving such the rapy. Those who have 
a molecularly targetable genetic mutation in their tumor must h ave 
also received the appropriate specific therapy for that mutatio n. All

F. Those patients who have received platinum-based doublet 
therapy in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting will only be eligible if they have experienced disease progression after  their last dose of cytotoxic chemotherapy 
G. For patients who have a neoplasm for which there 
currently exists a targeted therapy (such as to EGFR activating mutations, or ALK or ROS1 gene rearrangements) must have received all such targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_571945] d progressive disease through 
such treatments, or have been shown to be intolerant of such therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], prior to enrollment on this study 
H. Baseline laboratory values (bone  marrow, renal, hepatic):

First day of every odd-numbered cycle (beginning at Cycle 3): 
 CT or MRI of thorax and abdomen, or PET/CT (may be 
obtained up to one calendar week prior to first day of each odd  
numbered cycle)  
Statistical Considerations: This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_144873], so  we are interested in evaluat ing the 
feasibility and safety of a regimen of daily TAS-102 administer ed to 
subjects with squamous cell lung cancer. To minimize the number  of 
subjects exposed, the sample size will be determined by [CONTACT_571966]. A res ponse rate of 20% or above to T AS-
[ADDRESS_751102] in subjects with previously-treated squ amous 
cell lung cancer. Initially, 14 s ubjects will be evaluated for response, 
and if none of the 14 evaluable s ubjects experiences a partial or 
complete response, then the study will be terminated. If the tr ue 
response rate is 20%, the chance of rejection error is less tha n 5%. 
However, in the event of one response among the first [ADDRESS_751103] error  of no 
more than 9%. A subject is consid ered eligible for toxicity eva luation 
if they have received at least one dose of TAS-102. A subject w ill be 
considered eligible for evaluation of activity if they have als o received 
two cycles of therapy as planned.  
Estimated Enrollment Period: It is estimated that accrual to the first level (14 subjects) w ill be 
completed within nine months. If the study is fully accrued (30  
subjects) and at least the last s uch subject derives benefit fr om the 
anticipated maximal number of six cycles, then the length of th e entire 
enrollment and treatment peri od will be approximately 24 months . 
Estimated Study 
Duration: Approximately [ADDRESS_751104] common cause of cancer death  in both men and women in the 
[LOCATION_002]. The data from the American Cancer Society projec ted 1,658,370 cases of cancer in 
2015, with approximately 589,430 deaths; nearly [ADDRESS_751105] cancers are more common in men and women, r espectively, lung cancer is still 
a far more lethal malignancy in either sex, with a five-year su rvival rate that is less than 15%.  
Surveillance, Epi[INVESTIGATOR_623], and End-Results (SEER) database est imates for 2016 indicate that 
lung cancer will account for 224,390 new lung cancer cases, or 13.3% of all invasive cancer cases 
(not including non-melanoma skin cancer or in situ carcinomas),  and there will be 158,080 lung 
cancer deaths, or 26.5% of all deaths. In men 33% of all deaths  from cancer are going to be due to 
lung cancer, while in women, 5% o f all cancer-related deaths ar e due to lung cancer.   
 Approximately 70% of patients with unresectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who 
receive and progress through frontline chemotherapy will be eli gible for second line treatments. 
Any of the agents which are ava ilable for frontline therapy can  be used in the salvage setting; 
crizotinib and ceritinib (for AL K gene translocations), AZD9291  (Tagrisso, for EGFR T790M 
mutation positive lesions), erlotinib, ramicirumab, docetaxel, and pemetrexed (in non-squamous 
cell carcinoma) are FDA-approved in the salvage setting based u pon their demonstrated survival 
benefit in randomized phase III  trials. All untargeted agents a ppear to be roughly equivalent in 
terms of clinical benefit, which is admittedly modest, with res ponse rates <10%, clinical benefit 
rates of approximately 50%, and overall survivals of approximat ely [ADDRESS_751106] only been

including nonsmall cell lung cancer , especially the squamous ce ll variant. To date, there are no 
reports of a clinical evaluation of this agent in NSCLC, as is proposed here. This protocol will 
evaluate squamous cell NSCLC; nonsquamous cell NSCLC (adenocarc inomas, large cell

5.1 Treatment Schedule/Administration 
 
All participants will have unresectable, previously-treated squ amous cell NSCLC who have 
previously been treated with a platinum doublet (or have refuse d such prior therapy); those who 
have a molecularly targetable genetic mutation in their tumor m ust have also received the 
appropriate specific ther apy for that mutation. 
 Both men and women of all races and ethnic groups will be eligi ble for this trial. This study was 
designed to include women and minorities, but will not be desig ned to measure differences of 
intervention effects. Men and women will be recruited with no p reference to gender. No exclusion 
to this study will be based on race . Minorities will be activel y recruited to participate. 
 Eligible subjects will include those with radiographically-stag ed locally advanced or metastatic 
NSCLC who have received any prior therapy for the lesion(s). Pa tients who receive radiation 
therapy to any indicator lesion must have demonstrated progress ive growth of the lesion to be 
assessable; be willing to use contraception; are neither pregna nt nor lactating; are greater than [ADDRESS_751116] 1 2 weeks; have normal end-organ 
function and limited comorbiditie s, and are able to provide wri tten informed consent. 
 Upon confirmation of eligibility and provision of written infor med consent, subjects will receive 
TAS-102 (Lonsurf

the drug was administered to [ADDRESS_751119] ( i.e. > 20 ms) in th e mean QTc interval when compared 
to placebo and no evident exposur e-QT relationship was identifi ed. Two of 42 patients (4.8%) had 
QTc greater than 500 msec and 1 of 42 patients (2.4%) had a QTc  increase from baseline greater 
than [ADDRESS_751120] on the metabolism of 
this drug. Study participants may receive additional investigat ional antineoplastic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_571950]. Use of conc urrent investigational agents is not 
permitted.   Any therapy or medication (except study drugs), administered fr om screening until [ADDRESS_751121] dose of either study drug, is considered a concomitant  therapy or medication. However, if 
another course of anti-cancer therapy is initiated prior to the  28-day follow-up period visit; a record 
of concomitant medications will no longer be performed. If the use of any concomitant treatments 
(medications or procedures) becomes necessary, the treatment mu st be recorded, including the 
name [CONTACT_121366], dose, route, date, indication fo r use, expected duration, and 
frequency of treatment. Assessment and documentation of concomi tant medications will be done 
at each visit. Subjects are prohibited from receiving the following therapi[INVESTIGATOR_43837]:  
 Antineoplastic systemic chemo therapy or biological therapy  
 Immunotherapy not specifi ed in this protocol

CONFIDENTIAL 19 Version 1.8  Chemotherapy not specifi ed in this protocol  
 Investigational agents other than the study drug in this trial  
 Radiation therapy  
 
NOTE: Radiation therapy to a symptomatic solitary lesion may be considered on an exceptional 
case by [CONTACT_571970]-investigat or. The subject must have clear 
measurable disease outside the radi ated field. Administration of pal liative radiation therapy will 
be considered clinical progression fo r the purposes of determining PFS.  
 
Live vaccines within [ADDRESS_751122] dose of trial t reatment and while participating in the 
trial. Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited t o, the following: measles, mumps, 
rubella, chicken pox, yellow fever, rabies, BCG, and typhoid (o ral) vaccine. Seasonal influenza 
vaccines for injection are gene rally killed virus vaccines and are allowed. However, intranasal

5.3 Dose Modifications 
 
The National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Toxicity Criteria fo r Adverse Events Version 4 
(CTCAE) will be used to grade toxicity ( http://evs.nci.nih.gov/ ftp1/CTCAE/About.html ).   
 
The starting dose of TAS-102 is 35 mg/m2 up to a maximum of 80 mg per dose (based on the 
trifluridine component) orally twice daily within one hour of c ompletion of morning and evening 
meals on Days [ADDRESS_751123] 5 mg increment.  Study medication 
will be administered on a 4 week schedule. Doses will be delaye d or reduced for clinically 
significant (Grade 3-4) hematol ogic and non-hematologic toxicit ies that are related to protocol 
therapy according to the guidelines shown in the Dose Delays/Do se Modifications table that 
follows.  Dose modifications will follow predefined dose levels . Dose adjustments for hematologic 
toxicity are based on the blood c ounts obtained in preparation for the day of treatment.

Intrapatient dose reduction a nd dose interruption will be permi tted once a patient has experienced 
drug-related toxicity provided th at the criteria for patient wi thdrawal from study treatment have 
not been met. All intrapatient dos e reductions are relative to the lowest dose of the  current cycle.  
 For all toxicities, doses of TAS-102 will be modified based upo n Day 1 and Day 15, complete 
blood cell counts. Day 1 TAS-102 dos ing for each cycle will be held until: 
 Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) is greater than or equal to 1,5 00/mm

Within a treatment cycle, TAS -102 will be withheld for any of t he following: 
 Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) less than 500/mm3 or febrile neutropenia 
 Platelets less than 50,000/mm3  
 Grade 3 or 4 non-hematologi cal adverse reactions 
 
After recovery, resume TAS-102 after reducing the dose by 5 mg/ m2/dose (as above) from the 
previous dose level, if the following occur: 
 Febrile neutropenia 
 Uncomplicated Grade 4 neutropenia (which has recovered to great er than or equal to 
1,500/mm3, or baseline in subjects with benign ethnic neutropenia) or th rombocytopenia 
(which has recovered to greater than or equal to 75,000/mm3) that results in more than 1-
week delay in start of next cycle 
 Non-hematologic Grade 3 or Gra de 4 adverse reaction except for Grade 3 nausea and/or 
vomiting controlled by [CONTACT_571971] [ADDRESS_751124] causally related to study treatment. If more than 
3 dose reductions are required, TAS-102 will be discontinued. D o not escalate dose after it has 
been reduced.   
5.3.2 Non- Hematologic Toxicity 
 
For Grade 3 and 4 toxicities, tr eatment should be withheld unti l the toxicity resolves to Grade 1 or 
less (or to baseline), then reinstituted (if medically appropri ate) at a one level dose reduction. 
Nausea and vomiting or diarrhea must persist at Grade [ADDRESS_751125] meet pre-treatment laboratory criteria (as specif ied in the inclusion criteria) at Day

medication. 
 Disease progression, unless at the  discretion of the principal investigator (in collaboration with 
any co-sponsors or collaborators)  continued treatment with stud y drug is appropriate.

 The patient presents with a beta-HCG test consistent with pregn ancy.  Pregnancy will be 
reported along the same timelines a s a serious ad verse event. 
 The patient uses illicit drugs or other substances that may, in  the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], 
have a reasonable chance of cont ributing to toxicity or otherwi se interferin g with results. 
 The development of a second malignancy that requires treatment,  which would interfere with 
this study.

CONFIDENTIAL 22 Version 1.8  The patient is lost to follow-up. 
 Interruption in study drugs administration for greater than 21 days (see Dose Modification 
section). 
 Development of an intercurrent illness or situation which would , in the judgment of the 
investigator, affect assessment s of clinical status and study e ndpoints to a si gnificant degree. 
 The Investigator will make every  reasonable effort to keep each  patient in the study unless it is in 
the patient’s best interests to discontinue participation.  If a patient is removed from the study or 
declines further participation, a ll End of Treatment evaluation s should be performed if the patient 
is willing and able to be assesse d.  A description of the reaso n(s) for withdrawal from the study 
must be recorded on the case report form (CRF).  The Investigat or should also ensure that all 
patients are followed up for surviva l status after the Final Vi sit. 
 Relevant visit data should be entered on the CRF and any unused  study medication will be 
accounted for and returned for all patients participating in th e study, even for a brief period of 
time.  Patients who discontinue f ollowing entry will have relev ant information completed and 
recorded on the CRF.  All patient s who discontinue because of a dverse events or clinically 
significant laboratory abnormalities should be followed up unti l they recover or stabilize, and the 
subsequent outcome will be recorded.  If any patient should die  during the trial or within [ADDRESS_751127] not received any doses o f study drug prior to their continuing 
participation in the p rotocol for any reas on, or if the patient  wishes to discontinue participation in 
the protocol, but is not discon tinued for disease progression, toxicity, or any of the reasons listed 
in section 6.2.  
 
6.4 Study Discontinuation  
 
It is unlikely that the trial itself will require a premature t ermination.  However the trial will be 
stopped prematurely (prior to com pletion of accrual, protocol t herapy, and follow- up) for safety 
reasons if the therapy at Dose lev el [ADDRESS_751128] six patients, requiring dose 
reduction to Dose level -1.

8.[ADDRESS_751134]  their response classified according 
to the definitions stated below.  (Note:  Patients who exhibit objective disease progression prior to 
the end of cycle 1 will also be  considered evaluable.) 
 
Evaluable Non-Target Disease Response.  Patients who have lesio ns present at baseline that are 
evaluable but do not meet the definitions of measurable disease , have received at least one cycle 
of therapy, and have had their dis ease re-evaluated will be con sidered evaluable for non-target 
disease.  The response assessment is based on the presence, abs ence, or unequivocal progression 
of the lesions.   
Disease Parameters 
 
Measurable disease.  Measurable lesions are defined as those th at can be accurately measured in 
at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as ≥[ADDRESS_751135] x-ray or as ≥[ADDRESS_751136] be recorded in 
millimeters (or decimal fractions of centimeters). 
 
UF-STO-LUNG-003   2019-06-18 
 
CONFIDENTIAL 26 Version 1.8 Note:  Tumor lesions that are situated in a previously irradiat ed area are considered measurable 
only if they have demonstrated gr owth after completion of the r adiation therapy.   
 
Malignant lymph nodes.  To be considered pathologically enlarge d and measurable, a lymph node 
must be ≥[ADDRESS_751137] scan (CT scan slice thickness recommended 
to be no greater than 5 mm).  At baseline and in follow-up, onl y the short axis will be measured 
and followed.  Non-measurable disease.  All othe r lesions (or sites of disease ), including small lesions (longest 
diameter <10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with ≥10 to <15 mm short axis), are considered 
non-measurable disease.  Bone lesi ons, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial 
effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pneumonitis, inflammatory breast disease, and abdominal masses 
(not followed by [CONTACT_462]), are  considered as non-measurable. 
 Note:  Cystic lesions that meet the criteria for radiographical ly defined simple c ysts should not be 
considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non-mea surable) since they are, by 
[CONTACT_108], simple cysts.  ‘Cystic lesions’ thought  to represent cystic  metastases can be considered as measurable lesions, if 
they meet the definition of measurability described above. Howe ver, if non-cystic lesions are 
present in the same patient, the se are preferred for selection as target lesions. 
 Target lesions.  All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 le sions per organ and 5 lesions in 
total, representative of all involved organs, should be identif ied as target lesions  and recorded and 
measured at baseline.  Target lesions should be s elected on the  basis of their size (lesions with the 
longest diameter), be representati ve of all involved organs, bu t in addition should be those that 
lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements.  It may be the case that, on occasion, the 
largest lesion does not lend itself to reproducible measurement  in which circumstance the next 
largest lesion which can be measured reproducibly should be sel ected.  A sum of the diameters 
(longest for non-nodal lesions, shor t axis for nodal lesions) f or all target lesions will be calculated 
and reported as the baseline sum diameters.  If lymph nodes are  to be included in the sum, then 
only the short axis is added into the sum.  The baseline sum di ameters will be used as reference to 
further characterize any object ive tumor regression in the meas urable dimension of the disease. 
 
Non-target lesions.  All other lesions (or sites of disease) in cluding any measurable lesions over 
and above the 5 target lesi ons should be identified as non-target lesions and should also be 
recorded at baseline.  Measurements of these lesions are not re quired, but the presence, absence, 
or in rare cases unequivocal progression of each should be note d throughout follow-up.  
  
Methods for Evaluation of Measurable Disease 
 
All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notatio n using a ruler or calipers.  All 
baseline evaluations should be p erformed as closely as possible  to the beginning of treatment and 
never more than 4 weeks before t he beginning of the treatment. 
 
UF-STO-LUNG-003   2019-06-18 
 
CONFIDENTIAL 27 Version 1.8 The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each 
identified and reported lesion at  baseline and during follow-up . Imaging-based evaluation is 
preferred to evaluation by [CONTACT_571975](s) being followed cannot be 
imaged but are assessable by [CONTACT_461].  Clinical lesions.   Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they a re superficial 
(e.g., skin nodules and palpable lym ph nodes) and ≥10 mm diameter as  assessed using calipers 
(e.g., skin nodules).  In the case of skin lesions, documentation by  [CONTACT_6775], including a 
ruler to estimate the size of  the lesion, is recommended.  
 
Chest x-ray.   Lesions on chest x-ray are acceptable as measurable lesions whe n they are clearly 
defined and surrounded by [CONTACT_571976] d lung.  However, CT is prefera ble.  
 Conventional CT and MRI.  This guideline has defined measurabil ity of lesions on CT scan based 
on the assumption that CT slice thickness is [ADDRESS_751138] slice thickness greater 
than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be t wice the slice thickness.  MRI is 
also acceptable in certain situations ( e.g. for body scans).   
 Use of MRI remains a complex issue.  MRI has excellent contrast , spatial, and temporal resolution; 
however, there are many image acquisition variables involved in  MRI, which greatly impact image 
quality, lesion conspi[INVESTIGATOR_3934], and measurement.  Furthermore, the  availability of MRI is variable 
globally.  As with CT, if an MRI is performed, the technical sp ecifications of the scanning 
sequences used should be optimized for the evaluation of the ty pe and site of disease.  Furthermore, 
as with CT, the modality used at follow-up should be the same a s was used at baseline and the 
lesions should be measured/assessed on the same pulse sequence.   It is beyond the scope of the 
RECIST guidelines to prescribe specific MRI pulse sequence para meters for all scanners, body 
parts, and diseases.  Ideally, the same type of scanner should be used and the image acquisition 
protocol should be followed as closely as possible to prior sca ns.  Body scans should be performed 
with breath-hold scanning t echniques, if possible. 
 
PET-CT.  At present, the low dos e or attenuation correction CT portion of a combined PET-CT is 
not always of optimal diagnostic CT quality for use with RECIST  measurements.  However, if the 
site can document that the CT performed as part of a PET-CT is of identical diagnostic quality to 
a diagnostic CT (with IV and oral contrast), then the CT portio n of the PET-CT can be used for 
RECIST measurements and can be used interchangeably with conven tional CT in accurately 
measuring cancer lesions over time.  Note, however, that the PE T portion of the CT introduces 
additional data which may bias a n investigator if it is not rou tinely or serially performed.   
 Ultrasound.  Ultrasound is not useful in assessment of lesion s ize and should not be used as a 
method of measurement.  Ultrasound examinations cannot be repro duced in their entirety for 
independent review at a later d ate and, because they are operat or dependent, it cannot be 
guaranteed that the same technique and measurements will be tak en from one assessment to the 
next.  If new lesions are identified by [CONTACT_571977] e of the study, confirmation by [CONTACT_118582].  If there is concern about radiation exposure a t CT, MRI may be used instead of 
CT in selected instances. 
 
UF-STO-LUNG-003   2019-06-18 
 
CONFIDENTIAL 28 Version 1.8 Endoscopy or Laparoscopy. The utilization of these techniques f or objective tumor evaluation is 
not advised.  However, such techni ques may be useful to confirm  complete pathological response 
when biopsies are obtained or to determine relapse in trials wh ere recurrence following complete 
response (CR) or surgical resection is an endpoint. 
 Tumor Markers. Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess res ponse.  There are no validated 
tumor markers for NSCLC, a nd none are being evaluated here. 
 Cytology or Histology. These techniques can be used to differen tiate between partial responses 
(PR) and complete responses (CR) in rare cases ( e.g., residual lesions in tumor types, such as germ 
cell tumors, where known residua l benign tumors can remain). 
 The cytological confirmation of t he neoplastic origin of any ef fusion that appears or worsens 
during treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria for  response or stable disease is 
mandatory to differentiate betw een response or sta ble disease ( an effusion may be a side effect of 
the treatment) and progressive disease.  FDG-PET. While FDG-PET response assessments need additional stu dy, it is sometimes 
reasonable to incorporate the use of FDG-PET scanning to comple ment CT scanning in assessment 
of progression (particularly possible 'new' disease).  New lesi ons on the basis of FDG-PET imaging 
can be identified according to the following algorithm:  a. Negative FDG-PET at baseline, with a positive FDG-PET at follow -up is a sign of PD based 
on a new lesion. 
b. No FDG-PET at baseline and a pos itive FDG-PET at follow-up:  If  the positive FDG-PET at 
follow-up corresponds to a new site of disease confirmed by [CONTACT_4654],  this is PD.  If the positive 
FDG-PET at follow-up is not confirmed as a new site of disease on CT, additional follow-up 
CT scans are needed to determine if there is truly progression occurring at that site (if so, the 
date of PD will be the date of the initial abnormal FDG-PET sca n).  If the positive FDG-PET 
at follow-up corresponds to a pre-existing site of disease on C T that is not progressing on the 
basis of the anatomic images, this is not PD. 
c. FDG-PET may be used to upgrade a  response to a CR in a manner s imilar to a biopsy in cases 
where a residual radiographic abnormality is thought to represe nt fibrosis or scarring.  The use 
of FDG-PET in this circumstance should be prospectively describ ed in the protocol and 
supported by [CONTACT_4623]-specific medi cal literature for the indica tion.  However, it must be 
acknowledged that both approaches may lead to false positive CR  due to limitations of FDG-
PET and biopsy resolution/sensitivity. 
 
Note:  A ‘positive’ FDG-PET scan lesion means one which is FDG avid with an uptake greater 
than twice that of the surr ounding tissue on the attenuation co rrected image. 
 
8.2    Response Criteria 
 
Evaluation of Target Lesions 
 
Complete Response (CR):  Disappearance of all target lesions.  Any pathological lymph nodes 
(whether target or non-target) must have reduc tion in short axi s to <10 mm. 
UF-STO-LUNG-003   2019-06-18 
 
CONFIDENTIAL 29 Version 1.8  
Partial Response (PR):  At least a 30% decrease in the sum of t he diameters of target lesions, taking 
as reference the baseline sum diameters. 
 Progressive Disease (PD):  At least a 20% increase in the sum o f the diameters of target lesions, 
taking as reference the smallest  sum on study (this includes th e baseline sum if that is the smallest 
on study).  In addition to the rela tive increase of 20%, the su m must also demonstrate an absolute 
increase of at least 5 mm.  (Note:  the appearance of one or mo re new lesions is also considered 
progressions).  Stable Disease (SD):  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify f or PR nor sufficient increase to 
qualify for PD, taking as referen ce the smallest sum diameters while on study. 
 
Evaluation of Non-Target Lesions 
 
Complete Response (CR):  Disapp earance of all non-target lesion s and normalization of tumor 
marker level.  All lymph nodes mu st be non-pathological in size  (<10 mm short axis). 
 Note:  If tumor markers are initially above the upper normal li mit, they must normalize for a patient 
to be considered in comp lete clinical response. 
 Non-CR/Non-PD:  Persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s)  and/or maintenance of tumor 
marker level above the normal limits. 
 
P r o g r e s s i v e  D i s e a s e  ( P D ) :   A p p e a r a n c e  o f  o n e  o r  m o r e  n e w  l e s i o n s and/or unequivocal 
progression  of existing non-target lesions.  Unequivocal progression  should not normally trump 
target lesion status.  It must be representative of overall dis ease status change, not a single lesion 
increase.      Although a clear progression of “ non-target” lesions only is ex ceptional, the opi[INVESTIGATOR_62484], and the progres sion status should be confirmed at 
a later time by [CONTACT_463] (or Principal In vestigator). 
 
Evaluation of Best Overall Response 
 
The best overall response is the best response recorded from th e start of the treatment until disease 
progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive dis ease the smallest measurements 
recorded since the treatment started).  The patient's best resp onse assignment will depend on the 
achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria.

Duration of Response 
 
Duration of overall response:  Th e duration of overall response  is measured from the time 
measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first r ecorded) until the first date that 
recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (tak ing as reference for progressive 
disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started). 
 The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measuremen t criteria are first met for CR 
until the first date that progressive disease is objectively do cumented.

10. ADVERSE EVENTS 
 
10.1 Definitions 
 
10.1.1 Adverse Event 
 
The term “adverse event” includes any sign, symptom, syndrome, or illness that appears or 
worsens in a subject during the period of observation in the cl inical study and that may impair the 
wellbeing of the subject. The term also covers laboratory findi ngs or results of other diagnostic 
procedures that are considered t o be clinically significant ( e.g., that requires unscheduled 

UF-STO-LUNG-003   2019-06-18 
 
CONFIDENTIAL 52 Version 1.8 diagnostic procedures or treatme nt measures, or result in withd rawal from the study). 
 The adverse event may be: 
 A new illness/condition; 
 Worsening of a sign or symptom of the condition under treatment , or of a concomitant 
illness/condition; 
 An effect of the study drug; or 
 A combination of 2 or mor e of these factors. 
 No causal relationship with the  study drug or with the clinical  study itself is implied by [CONTACT_571978] “adverse event.”  Surgical procedures themselves are not adverse events; they are  therapeutic measures for 
conditions that require surgery. The condition(s) for which the  s u r g e r y  i s  r e q u i r e d  m a y  b e  a n  
adverse event. Planned surgical measures permitted by [CONTACT_571979](s) leading to these meas ures are not adverse events. 
 When a clear diagnosis is available that explains the abnormal objective findings, this diagnosis 
will be recorded as an adverse event and not the abnormal objec tive findings ( e.g., viral hepatitis 
will be recorded as the adverse event and not the transaminase elevation). If a definitive diagnosis 
is not available, then the sign(s) ( e.g., clinically significant elevation of transaminase levels) or 
symptom(s) ( e.g., abdominal pain) will be record ed as the adverse event. 
Adverse events fall into the categories “serious” and “non-seri ous.” 
 
10.1.[ADDRESS_751141] ug or at any time during the period 
of observation: 
 Results in death 
 Is life-threatening (defined as an event in which the subject w as at risk of death at the time 
of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypotheticall y might have caused death if 
it were more severe) 
 Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_571954] (see 
note below for exceptions) 
 Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity 
 Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
 Is an important medical event, defined as a medical event that may not be immediately life-
threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_313], based on  appropriate medical and 
scientific judgment, may jeopard ize the subject or may require intervention (e.g., medical, 
surgical) to prevent one of the other serious outcomes listed a bove. Examples of such 
events include but are not limite d to intensive treatment in an  emergency department or at 
home for allergic bronchospasm ; blood dyscrasias or convulsions  that do not result in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. “Medically impor tant” should be marked only if  no other serious criteria 
are met. 
 
UF-STO-LUNG-003   2019-06-18 
 
CONFIDENTIAL 53 Version 1.8 An “unexpected SAE”  is any SAE for which the nature, specificity or severity is not  consistent 
with the currently known adverse event profile of the investiga tional agent(s) and no t listed in the 
current TAS-102 Global IB. 
 
NOTE: The following hospi[INVESTIGATOR_571955]: 
 a visit to the emergency room or other hospi[INVESTIGATOR_571956] 24 hours that 
does not result in admission (unl ess considered an “important m edical event” or a 
life-threatening event) 
 elective surgery planned before signing consent 
 admissions as per protocol for a  planned medical/surgical proce dure 
 routine health assessment requiring admission for baseline/tren ding of health status (eg, 
routine colonoscopy) 
 medical/surgical admission for purpose other than remedying ill  health state that was 
planned before study entry. Appropr iate documentation is requir ed in these cases. 
 admission encountered for another life circumstance that carrie s no bearing on health status 
and requires no medical/surgical intervention (e.g., lack of ho using, economic inadequacy, 
caregiver respi[INVESTIGATOR_040], family circumstances, administrative). 
 
Clarification of the difference in meaning between “severe” and  “serious” 
The term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity (seve rity) of a specific event (as in mild, 
moderate, or severe myocardial i nfarction); the event itself, h owever, may be of relatively minor 
medical significance (such as severe headache). Any grade ≥ 3 a dverse event per CTCAE is 
generally considered severe AE. This is not the same as “seriou s,” which is based  on the outcome 
or action criteria usually associ ated with events that pose a t hreat to life or functioning. Seriousness 
(not severity) serves as a gui de for defining regulatory report ing obligations. 
 
10.1.[ADDRESS_751142]’s written consent to participate in the s tudy, all SAEs must be collected, 
including those thought to be as sociated with protocol-specifie d procedures. Collection of all SAEs 
must continue for [ADDRESS_751143] be collected that 
relate to any later protocol-specified procedure (e.g., a follo w-up skin biopsy). The investigator 
should notify the DISC of any SAE occurring after this time per iod that is believed to be related 
to the investigational product  or protocol-specified procedure.  
 The investigator will begin co llecting non-serious adverse even t (NSAE) information at screening. 
This NSAE information should also be collected from the start o f a placebo lead-in period or other 
observational period intended to establish a baseline status fo r the subjects.  Treated subjects, 
including those who were prematu rely discontinued from the stud y, will be followed for any 
adverse events that occur duri ng the study until [ADDRESS_751144] dose of  study treatment 
UF-STO-LUNG-003   2019-06-18 
 
CONFIDENTIAL 54 Version 1.8 (i.e., the Follow-up Visit).  How ever, if another course of ant i-cancer therapy is initiated prior to 
the 30-day follow-up period visit, collection of adverse events  will no longer be performed, with 
the exception of events that may be possibly, probably, or defi nitely related to the investigational 
agent or are clinically significant.   
10.[ADDRESS_751145]’s case  record form. 
 Documentation must be supported by [CONTACT_36927]’s fi le.  A laboratory test abnormality 
considered clinically relevant, e.g., causing the subject to wi thdraw from the study, requiring 
treatment or causing apparent c linical manifestations, or judge d relevant by [CONTACT_093], 
should be reported as an adverse event.  Each event should be d escribed in detail along with start 
and stop dates, severity, relati onship to investigational produ ct, action taken and outcome. 
 Every attempt should be made to describe the adverse event in t erms of a diagnosis that 
encompasses the component signs and symptoms. If only nonspecif ic signs or symptoms are 
present, then these should be r ecorded as separate diagnoses on  the pages of the case report form. 
 All subjects who have adverse events, whether considered associ ated with the use of study drug 
or not, must be monitored to determine the outcome. The clinica l course of the adverse event will 
be followed according to accepted standards of medical practice , even after the end of the period 
of observation, until a satisfactory explanation is found or th e Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_571957]-up. Should the advers e event result in death, a full 
pathologist’s report shou ld be supplied, if possible. 
 
10.3.[ADDRESS_751146] udy medication. The relationship or association of the adverse event 
to the study medication will be characterized as not related, p robably not related, possibly related, 
probably related, or related:    Not Related: There is not a temporal relationship to the study drug administ ration or the adverse 
event is clearly due only to t he progression of the underlying disease state, intercurrent illness, 
concomitant medication, concurrent therapy or other known cause . 
 Probably Not Related:   There is little or no chance that the study drug administrati on caused the 
adverse event; the event is mos t likely due to another competin g cause, including intercurrent 
illness, progression or expression of the disease state, or a r eaction to a concomitant medication or 
concurrent therapy appearing t o explain the reported adverse ev ent.  
 Possibly Related:   The association of the adverse event with the study drug admi nistration is 
unknown; however, the adverse even t is not reasonably attribute d to any other condition.  
 
UF-STO-LUNG-003   2019-06-18 
 
CONFIDENTIAL 55 Version 1.8 Probably Related:  When a reasonable temporal relationship exists between the adve rse event 
and the study drug administrati on; significant symptoms abate u pon discontinuation of the study 
drug and there is a reasonable explanation based on known chara cteristics of the study drug and 
there is no clear association with preexisting disease or thera py, intercurrent illness, concurrent 
therapy or other factor(s).  Related:   When the adverse event is a known side effect of the study dr ug or there is a temporal 
relationship to the administration of the study drug; or the ad verse event reappears upon re-
administration of the study drug (rechallenge); or the signific ant symptoms of the adverse event 
abate upon discontinuation of t he study drug (dechallenge). 
 
10.3.2 Intensity of Adverse Events 
 
The intensity of adverse changes in physical signs or symptoms will be graded according to the 
CTCAE version 4.03.  For all other adverse events not described  in the CTCAE, the intensity will 
be assessed by [CONTACT_571980]:  
 Mild  (Grade 1) – transient or mild discomfort; no limitation in act ivity; no medical 
intervention/therapy required.  Moderate  (Grade 2) – mild to moderate limitation in activity, some assi stance may be needed; no 
or minimal medical inter vention/therapy required. 
 Severe  (Grade 3) – marked limitation in activity, some assistance usu ally required; medical 
intervention/therapy require d, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_27594]. 
 
Life-threatening  (Grade 4) – extreme limitation in activity, significant assist ance required; 
significant medical interventi on/therapy required, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_571958]. 
 Death  (Grade 5) – the event  resulted in death. 
 
10.3.3 Action Taken with Study Drug 
 
The action the Investigator took with study drug as a result of  the event should be recorded as one 
of the following:  None – No action was taken with reg ard to the study drug as a result  of the adverse event. 
 Interrupted – Study drug was stopped due to the adverse event, but was late r resumed at the same 
dose.  Dose decreased – The dose of study drug was decreased as a result of the adver se event. 
 Permanently discontinued – The subject was withdrawn from the study due to the adverse e vent. 
 Only one item should be chosen. If multiple actions apply, the following “worst case” scenario 
UF-STO-LUNG-003   2019-06-18 
 
CONFIDENTIAL 56 Version 1.8 hierarchy should be used to dete rmine the preferred entry: 
 Discontinued > dose decreas ed > therapy interrupted. 
 
10.3.4 Definition of Outcome 
 
The outcome of the AE should be rec orded as one of the followin g: 
 
Resolved without sequelae  – The subject fully recovered fr o m  t h e  a d v e r s e  e v e n t  w i t h  n o  
observable residual effects. 
 
Resolved with sequelae  – The subject recovered from the  adverse event with observable  residual 
effects. 
 
Not resolved  – The adverse event was present at the time of last observatio n. 
 
Death  – The subject died as a resu lt of the adverse event. 
 
10.4 Immediately Reportable Events 
 
10.4.1 Serious Adverse Events 
 Serious adverse events (SAE's ) must be documented on a SAE Repo rt Form must be emailed to 
the UFHCC DISC Safety Team within [ADDRESS_751147] be kept within the  Trial Master File at the study 
site. The site investigator is re sponsible for informing the IR B and/or the Re gulatory Authority 
of the SAE as per local requirements. 
 Follow-up information will be emailed or faxed to the UFHCC usi ng the SAE Report Form stating 
that this is a follow-up to the previously reported SAE and giv ing the date of the original report. 
Each re-occurrence, complication, or progression of the origina l event should be reported as a 
follow-up to that event regardless of when it occurs. The follo w-up information should describe 
whether the event has resolved or continues, if and how it was treated, whether the blind was 
broken or not (if applicable), a nd whether the participant cont inued or withdrew from study 
participation.  The UFHCC Protocol Development O ffice (PDO) must also be notifi ed of the SAE by [CONTACT_25541] 
[EMAIL_10898] within 24 hours  of awareness of the event.  
 
Taiho Reporting Requirements 
 All SAEs, as well as events of  overdose, medication error, preg nancy (whether serious or non-
serious), to Taiho Oncology pharmac ovigilance or designee withi n 24 hours of awareness.  SAEs 
will be reported to Taiho On cology either by e-mail at [EMAIL_10899]  or via fax 
at ([PHONE_11861].  Any SAE inquiries  to Taiho Oncology may be done by [CONTACT_571981] 
([PHONE_11862].  NOTE: The hotline  phone number is for inquirie s only; not to report SAEs. 
 
UF-STO-LUNG-003   2019-06-18 
 
CONFIDENTIAL 57 Version 1.8 At the time of the annual DSUR ( data-lock point), all AEs which  led to discontinuation; list of 
subjects with fatal events; and de mographic information for all  subjects exposed to TAS-[ADDRESS_751148] be 
followed to outcome.  Although overdose (dose variance of >25%) and cancer are not al ways serious by [CONTACT_157335], these events should also be reported to the DISC in  an expedited manner.  In case the 
overdose did not result in any adverse event, the Investigator should report this as “overdose, no 
adverse event” on the SAE form and provide the intended amount,  as well as the actual amount, 
of drug administered.  In the event of overdose or exaggerated response, appropriate supportive 
measures should be employed.  Actual treatment should depend on  the severity of the clinical 
situation and the judgment and e xperience of the treating physi cian. 
 Pregnancies and overdoses should be documented and reported per  the SAE reporting guidelines 
in section 10.4.1 above.  
10.5 IND Safety Reports Unrelated to this Trial 
 
IND safety reports not occurring on this trial but  involving the study inte rvention (outside SAEs) 
received from outside sources wi ll be forwarded to participating sites for submission to their 
Institutional Review Boards  per their guidelines.  
 
11.    STATISTICAL METHODS 
 
11.1 Sample Size Determination 
 
This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_144873], so we are interested in evaluat ing the feasibility and safety of a 
regimen of daily TAS-102 admin istered to subjects with squamous  cell lung cancer. To minimize 
the number of subjects exposed, the sample size will be determi ned by [CONTACT_571982]. A response rate of 20% or above to TAS-[ADDRESS_751149] in subjects with previously-
treated squamous cell lung cancer. Initially, 14 subjects will be evaluated for response, and if none 
of the 14 evaluable subjects experiences a partial or complete response, then the study will be 
terminated. If the true response rate is 20%, the chance of rej ection error is less than 5%. However, 
in the event of one response am ong the first [ADDRESS_751150] error of no more 
than 9%. A subject is considered eligible for toxicity evaluati on if they have received at least one 
dose of TAS-102. A subject will be  considered eligible for eval uation of activity if they have also 
received two cycles of therapy as planned.   
UF-STO-LUNG-[ADDRESS_751151] level (14 subjects) will 
be completed within nine months. If the study is fully accrued (30 subjects) and at least the last 
such subject derives benefit from the anticipated maximal numbe r of six cycles, then the length of 
the entire study will be approximately 24 months.  
11.2 Analysis of Endpoints/Efficacy 
 
The primary endpoint to this study will be to document the obje ctive rate of re sponse by [CONTACT_571983], version 1.[ADDRESS_751152] 95% 
binomial confidence intervals. 
 
The secondary endpoints of this study will be to determine the rate of development of toxicities, 
and the reversibility of toxicities of this regimen; the Object ive Response Rate (by [CONTACT_571983]); the Clinical Benefit Rate (objective response + dise ase stability rate); the median 
duration of response in months, and the median Overall Survival . 
 A secondary endpoint of this study will be progression-free sur vival following TAS-102 therapy.  
Kaplan-Meier mean estimates and survival curves of progression- free survival rates will be 
calculated. Secondary endpoints in clude clinical benefit rate ( CR + PR + SD), toxicities and 
reversibility of toxicities) wil l also be estimated along with exact 95% binomial confidence 
intervals.  
11.3 Analysis of Demographic a nd Baseline Characteristic 
 
The analysis of demographic char acteristics (age, gender, tobac co abuse history and ethnicity) and 
baseline characteristics, incl uding weight change, performance status, and histologic subtype, will 
be primarily descriptive. However, they will be compared betwee n the treatment arm and historical 
controls to determine if there is any imbalance, which might sk ew the results of the patient 
outcomes. These endpoints will be primarily descriptive in natu re due to the small patient numbers; 
however, these results will be com pared against historical US c ontrols. Continuous variables will 
be compared to historical controls using either a two-sample t- test or Wilcoxon rank sum test 
depending on normality assumptions, and discrete outcomes will be compared using either Chi-
square or Fisher’s exact tests.  
11.4  Analysis of Safety Data 
 
Patients will be examined and graded each cycle for subjective/ objective evidence of developi[INVESTIGATOR_571959]-CTC v ersion 4.[ADDRESS_751153] one epi[INVESTIGATOR_181600], 
incidence of adverse events causing withdrawal and incidence of  serious adverse events. The total 
number of epi[INVESTIGATOR_174562] (Frequency Table), t he severity and attribution to study 
therapy of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_174563] (Severity Table and Attributio n Table) will also be displayed.  
Listings of adverse events by [CONTACT_571984], the duration of each event, 
the severity of each event, and the relationship of the event t o study therapy, whether it was a 
serious event, and whether it caused withdrawal. Safety data wi ll be summarized for the overall 
patient group and by [CONTACT_28805]. Dose-toxicity curves will be fitted to the final data to estimate 
the toxicity rates of each dose levels.     
12. DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING 
 
12.1 Data Integrity and Safety Committee 
 
This protocol will be reviewed and monitored by [CONTACT_571985] 
(UFHCC) Data Integrity and Safety Committee (DISC) in accordanc e with their policies and 
procedures.  They will review and monitor study progress, toxic ity, safety and other data from this 
trial. Questions about subject safety or protocol performance w ill be addressed with the sponsor-
investigator, statistician and study team members. Should any m ajor concerns arise; the DISC will 
offer recommendations regardi ng whether or not to suspend the t rial. 
 UFHCC DISC data and safety mon itoring activitie s include:  
 Review of clinical trial conduc ted for progress and safety

 1  Protocol Synopsis 
PROTOCOL TITLE:  Phase II Study of Ofatumumab in Combination with High Dose 
Methylprednisolone followed by [CONTACT_496425]/SLL: The HiLOG trial.  
DATE PROTOCOL FINAL:  June 20, 2011 
INDICATION:  Untreated  CLL/SLL  
STUDY PHASE:  Phase II  
BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE : Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) , the most 
common leukemia in the Western countries,  is characterized by a progressive 
accumulation of functionally incompetent monoclonal B lymphocytes . CLL is considered 
to be identical (same disease at different stages) to the mature B -cell small lymphocytic 
lymphoma (SLL).(1) CLL is typi[INVESTIGATOR_56388] a disease of the elderly, with a median 
age at dia gnosis of 72 years.(2, 3) The disease remains non curable by [CONTACT_496426]. 
In addition, t he vast majority of patients diagnosed with CLL are older than [ADDRESS_638104] patients with CLL 
to tolerate traditional chemotherapy regimens due to the associated toxicities.  A non-
chemotherapeutic regimen that provides high efficacy with less toxicity than 
conventional regimens  would be desirable in this population . We are proposing a 
combination regimen consisting of high dose methylprednisolone combined with 
ofatumumab, followed by [CONTACT_496427]. (See Table 1 for dosing and details of treatment regimen ). The rationale for 
exploring this combination regimen is based on the following previously published trials:  
 
Results of a phase II study combining Rituximab, an anti CD20 monoclonal antibody, 
with high dose methylprednisolone as a salvage  regimen for the treatment of patient s 
with fludarabine refractory CLL showed an overall response rate (ORR) of 93% with a complete remission rate (CR) of 36%. The regimen was well tolerated, and serious 
adverse events were rare. All patients were able to complete the scheduled treatment 
without delays or dosage reductions.
 (4) Another recent paper from the same gr oup 
 Confidential  Page 7 of 92  
 
Amendment 5 Dated 03/02/2016 
 showed similar efficacy in the front line setting using a reduced dose of steroids.  They 
showed an ORR of 96% with a CR rate of 32%.  (5) 
 
Ofatumumab (Arzerra®) is a human monoclonal antibody that targets a unique small -
loop epi[INVESTIGATOR_83825]20 and elicits potent in vitro  complement -dependent cytotoxicity, even 
in malignant B cells with low levels of CD20 expression . Ofatumumab is currently 
approved by [CONTACT_496428] .  It is also under 
development by [CONTACT_496429], relapsed or refractory B -cell 
follicular lymphoma, for the treatment of untreated CLL, for the treatment of active 
rheumatoid arthritis, and other autoimmune diseases.  
 
Ofatumumab has been studied in patients with fludarabine and alemtuzumab refractory 
CLL ( FA-ref) or refractory to fludarabine with bulky (>5cm) lymphadenopathy (BF-ref). 
(6) Ofatumumab was given weekly x 8 doses followed by [CONTACT_496430] x 4. Results 
of a planned interim analysis included 138 treated patients with FA -ref (n = 59) and BF -
ref (n = 79) CLL. The overall response rates (primary end point) were 58% [corrected] 
and 47% in the FA -ref and BF -ref groups, respectively. Complete resolution of 
constitutional symptoms and improved performance status occurred in 57% and 48% of 
patients, respectively. Median progression -free survival and overall survival times were 
5.[ADDRESS_638105] antitumor 
mechanism remains elusive. However, its antitumor activity seems to be mediated 
through its ability to modulate production of various key survival cytokines such as  TNF -
 Confidential  Page 8 of 92  
 
Amendment 5 Dated 03/02/[ADDRESS_638106] other component s of the tumor microenvironment, including the immune 
cellular compartment. Preclinical studies demonstrated that lenalidomide enhances NK -
cell mediated and monocyte -mediated tumor cell ADCC for a variety of rituximab treated 
NHL cell lines in vitro. (7) A Phase II trial of single agent lenalidomide in patients with 
relapsed or ref ractory CLL revealed an ORR of 47% with a CR rate of 9%.  (8) Another 
phase II trial of single agent lenalidomide for the treatment of relapsed or refractory CLL 
revealed an ORR of 32% with 7% CR, 25% stable disease. The most common toxicity 
was myelosuppression, and the median daily dose of lenalidomide tolerated was 10 mg.  
(9) More recently t wo combination trials of lenalidomide and rituximab have  been 
reported in abstract form from our center  (10) and the MDACC . (11) Both of these studies 
evaluated patients with relapsed disease and showed an overall response rate of 60%.  
 
Our hypothesis is that ofatumumab will produce higher rates of CR in this setting. The 
consolidation with lenalidomide is based on the fact that this drug has  activity in CLL but 
is not immunosuppress ive. In addition, there is evidence that lenalidomide c an improve 
the immune system of patient s with CLL as well as increase the rates of CR in this  
population. The reason for incorporating lenalidomide after debulking  patients with high 
dose steroids and ofatumumab is based on the experience with lenalidomide as a single 
agent in the relapsed and front line setting.  In this setting tumor lysis syndrome and 
tumor flare  were observed . We believe that th is sequence of drugs will carry less toxicity 
and will be better tolerated.

STUDY OBJECTIVES:  
Primary:    
1. To estimate  the response rate for the combination of ofatumumab with high dose 
methylprednisolone followed by [CONTACT_496431]/SLL with indication 
criteria to initiate treatment (See Appendix E: Criteria for Treatment) . 
 
Secondary:    
      To collect preliminary efficacy data on:  
1. Progression/relapse free survival.  
2. Overall survival.  
 
STUDY DESIGN : 
This is a phase II, single institution, and non -randomized study of patients with untreated 
CLL/SLL, utilizing a two -stage trial design. The primary endpoint for this trial is the 
combined complete and partial response rate (at 3 months, after the end of cycle 3) to the 
protocol therapy. We anticipate this trial will have a CR+PR response rate of at least 
80%.  
 Confidential  Page 10 of 92  
 
Amendment 5 Dated 03/02/2016 
  
A two -stage design is employed for this trial. The null/unacceptable CR+PR response 
rate is ≤60% while the anticipated true response rate to the protocol treatment is at least 
80% for each disease cohort. At the first stage, 26 patients will be accrued to the trial. If 
15 or fewer of these patients respond, then the trial will be terminated early and the 
response rate to the protocol treatment will be deemed unacceptable (≤60%). Otherwise, 
if more than [ADDRESS_638107] stage, an additional 19 patients will be 
enrolled to this trial during stage 2 for a total of 45 patients. If 32 or fewer of these 45 
patients respond to  the protocol treatment at the end of stage 2, no further investigation of 
the protocol treatment is considered warranted. On the other hand, if more than 32 
patients out of the 45 enrolled patients respond, the protocol treatment will be considered 
promis ing. If the true response rate is ≤60%, the probability of ending the trial at stage [ADDRESS_638108] 80%, then the probability of ending 
the trial at stage 1 is only 0.01. This two -stage design has an overall alph a level of 0.045 
and a power of 0.90.  
 
For the purpose of interim analysis at the end of stage 1, the objective response will be 
measured by [CONTACT_5638] 3 months (or end of cycle 3) from the start of the protocol 
treatment prior to the initiation of the com bination of ofatumumab with lenalidomide. 
The accrual will not be suspended while waiting for the results of the interim analysis 
unless the observed objective response rate among those patients whose objective respons e data are available is below 55%.

escalation or interruption of the planned dosing schedule) for ≥ [ADDRESS_638113]/SGOT, ALT/SGPT , LDH, and uric acid.  At a minimum, for tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) monitoring purposes, subjects will have chemistry assessments 
weekly during at least the first 2 cycles of lenalidomide -containing treatment .  Chemistry assessments on  Day 3 or 4 of Cycle  1 of lenalidomide -containing treatment are 
at the investigator’s discretion.  In addition, because the risk for TLS may be elevated when lenalidomide is re -started after treatment interruptions or when the

Amendment 5 Dated 03/02/2016 
 3 Background and Rationale  
3.1 Introduction: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia / Small lymphocytic lymphoma  
Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), a monoclonal B -cell malignancy with a low level 
of proliferation, is cha racterized by a progressive accumulation of mature -appearing but 
functionally incompetent, malignant B lymphocytes. CLL is the most common form of 
leukemia diagnosed in the Western countries . (1) It accounts for over 15,000 new 
diagnoses (almost 40% of all leukemias) and over 4,000 deaths per year in the United 
States. CLL is a disease of the elderly with a median age at diagnosis of 72 years and 
more than two- thirds of patients are over 65 years of age. (2, 3) 
 The cells are characterized by [CONTACT_496433] B -cell markers such as CD19, CD20, and 
CD22 but also express CD5 which is a T -cell marker. 
(2) The s pectrum of this disease 
varies from a simple lymphocytosis to splenomegaly and/or cytopenias.  Some patients 
have an indolent course while others have a more accelerated course.  In either case, the 
disease relapses frequently once treatment is initiated, and there is considerable morbidity 
from the disease and the treatments themselves.  (12) 
 
Several predictive factors have been identified in CLL In addition to clinical staging, traditional prognostic factors for identifying high risk of disease progression have 
included elevated serum levels of beta- 2 microglobulin, soluble CD23, diffuse bone 
marrow infiltration,
 short lymphocyte doubling time, and high levels of zeta -associated 
protein (ZAP -70) on the surface of malignant cells.  (13, 14) More recently, the presence of 
certain cytogenetic abnormalities identified by [CONTACT_26707] (FISH) analysis and mutational status of immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgHV) have become a 
more meaningful predictor of disease progression and duration of response to therapy.

patients do relapse and require further treatments. Patients without a complete response 
also progress and require further therapy. Considering that the vast majority of patients 
diagnosed with CLL are older than 65 years of age , there is a need to search for a non -
chemotherapeutic regimen that provides high efficacy with less toxicity than conventional regimens. We are proposing a combination regimen consisting of high dose 
methylprednisolone combined with ofatumumab, followed by [CONTACT_496435] (See Section 1  Table 1 for dosing  schema  
and details of regimen).  
3.2 Ofatumumab  
Ofatumumab (Arzerra®) is a
 human monoclonal antibody that targets a unique small -
loop epi[INVESTIGATOR_83825]20 and elicits potent in vitro  complement -dependent cytotoxicity, even  
in malignant B cells with low levels of CD20 expression. Ofatumumab is currently 
approved by [CONTACT_496436] . It is also under  
development by [CONTACT_496429], relapsed or refractory B -cell 
follicular lymphoma, for the treatment of untreated  CLL,  for the treatment of active 
rheumatoid arthritis , and other autoimmune diseases.  
3.2.1 Ofatumumab Indications  
Ofatumumab was approved by [CONTACT_362128] 27th, 2009 for the treatment of 
patients with CLL whose cancer is no longer being controlled by [CONTACT_496437]. It has also shown potential in treating follicular non -Hodgkin’s lymphoma

 (FL), diffuse large B cell lymphoma, rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and relapsing remitting 
multiple sclerosis.  
3.2.[ADDRESS_638121] been reported. The following reactions 
should be rega rded as expected infusion -related adverse reactions in connection with the 
use of ofatumumab probably as a consequence of B cell depletion and cytokine release: pruritus, dyspnea, bronchospasm, throat irritation, cough, pharyngolaryngeal pain, 
flushing, hy perhidrosis, nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain, hypotension, 
rash/urticaria, influenza- like-illness, fatigue, fever, chills, headache, dizziness, myalgia 
and art hralgia.  
 The incidence of infusion- related symptoms was highest during the first infusion and 
decreased substantially with subsequent infusions. Implementation of pre -medication 
before infusions has reduced the number as well as the severity of infusion related 
adverse events. One serious case of cytokine release complicated with laryngeal edem a 
and one case of anaphylactoid -like reaction have been observed; both events were fully 
reversible after cessation of the infusion and proper treatment. It should be noted that 
none of these subjects received premedication with prednisolone.  
 During the ongoing study in subjects with CLL refractory to alemtuzumab and 
fludarabine , infusion related adverse events have been reported in approximately 30% of 
subjects. Only 2 -3 % were serious adverse events. All subjects received pre- medication 
with prednisolone , acetaminophen and antihistamine. In the completed CLL trial 402 in 
patients with relapsed or refractory CLL, 15% of the subjects had serious infections. In the ongoing CLL 406 trial in subjects refractory to both alemtuzumab and fludarabine an 
increased frequency of serious infections (25 -30%) have been reported.

care & managem ent of subjects with hepatitis B to manage/treat subjects who are anti -HBc 
positive. Initiate anti -viral therapy if required.  If a subject’s HBV DNA becomes positive during 
the study, notify the NOVARTIS  medical monitor. For subjects who have not completed  planned 
ofatumumab therapy, discuss with the medical monitor the risks and benefits of continuing or discontinuing ofatumumab before appropriate treatment decisions are made for that individual subject.
 
One case of Progressive Multifocal Leukoe ncephalopat hy (PML) has been reported in a 
very ill CLL subject previously treated with alemtuzumab and fludarabine and with a 
very low CD4 cell count. Leukopenia, including neutropenia, anemia, and 
thrombocytopenia have been reported in CLL subjects. These events ar e most likely 
related to the patients’ baseline disease; however, a causal relationship to ofatumumab cannot be excluded.  
3.3 High Dose Methylprednisolone  
Methylprednisolone is a corticosteroid that has been on the market for several years and is available in generic form.  
 
Results of a phase II study combining Rituximab, an anti CD20 monoclonal antibody, 
with high dose methylprednisolone as salvage regimen for the treatment of patient with 
fludarabine refractory CLL showed an overall response rate (ORR) of 93%  with a 
complete remission rate (CR) of 36%. The regimen was well tolerated and serious adverse events were rare. All patients were able to complete the scheduled treatment 
without delays or dosage reductions. 
(4) Another recent paper from the same group 
showed a similar efficacy in  the front line setting using a reduced dose of steroids.  They 
showed an ORR of 96% with a CR rate of 32%. (5)

3.4 Lenalidomide 
Lenalidomide (Revlimid®) is a proprietary IMiD® compound of Celgene Corporation.  
IMiD® compounds have both immunomodulatory and anti -angiogenic properties which 
 Confidential  Page 20 of 92  
                                           
 
Amendment 5 Dated 03/02/[ADDRESS_638124] in part to inhibition of Akt 
phosphorylation response to bFGF  (16).  In addition, lenalidomide has a variety of 
immunomodulatory effects.  Lenalidomide stimulates T cell proliferation, stimulates  the 
production of IL -2, IL -10 and IFN -gamma, inhibits IL -1 beta and IL -6, and modulates 
IL-12 production.(17) Up regulation of T cell derived IL -[ADDRESS_638125] 
in part through increased AP -1 activity. (18) 
Although the exact antitumor mechanism of action of lenalidomide is unknown, a number of mechanisms are postulated to be responsible for lenalidomide’s activity 
against multiple myeloma.  Lenal idomide has been shown to increase T cell proliferation, 
which leads to an increase in IL -2 and IFN -γ secretion.  The increased level of these 
circulating cytokines augment natural killer cell number and function, and enhance 
natural killer cell activity to yield an increase in multiple myeloma cell lysis . 
(19)  In 
addition, lenalidomide has direct activity against multiple myeloma and induces apoptosis or G1growth arrest in multiple myeloma cell lines and in multiple myeloma 
cells of patients resistant to melphalan, doxorubicin and dexamethasone .  
(20) 
Lenalidomi de Indications and Usage:  
 Lenalidomide is indicated for the treatment of  patients with transfusion -dependent 
anemia due to Low - or Intermediate -1-risk myelodysplastic syndromes  associated with a 
deletion 5q cytogenetic abnormality with or without additional cytogenetic abnormalities.  
Revlimid® is also approved in combination with dexamethasone for the treatment of 
patients with multiple myeloma that have received at least one p rior therapy.  
Lenalidomide Adverse Events  
Most frequently reported adverse events reported during clinical studies with 
lenalidomide in oncologic and non- oncologic indications, regardless of presumed 
relationship to study medication include: anemia, neutr openia, thrombocytopenia and 
pancytopenia, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, dehydration, rash, itching,

Amendment 5 Dated 03/02/[ADDRESS_638126] compression, syncope, 
disease progression, death not specified and fractures.  Tumor flare reaction s (TFR) ha ve 
been reported frequently in CLL patients treated with lenalidomide.  Tumor lysis 
syndrome (TLS) has been reported in CLL patients treated with lenalidomide.  
Precautions must be taken to prevent TLS including proper selection of patients with regard to renal function, correction of electrolyte abnormalities, and TLS prophylaxis and 
monitoring.  
Complete and updated adverse events are available in the Investigational Drug Brochure 
and the IND Safety Letters.  
3.5  Rationale for Combination Regimen in CLL/SLL  
The rationale for exploring this combination regimen is based on the following previously published trials. Results of a phase II s tudy combining Rituximab, an anti 
CD20 monoclonal antibody, with high dose methylprednisolone as salvage regimen for the treatment of patient with fludarabine refractory CLL showed an overall response rate 
(ORR) of 93% with a complete remission rate (CR) o f 36%. The regimen was well 
tolerated and serious adverse events were rare. All patients were able to complete the scheduled treatment without delays or dosage reductions. 
(4)  
 
Ofatumumab single agent has been studied in patients with fludarabi ne and alemtuzumab 
refractory CLL (FA -ref) or refractory to fludarabine with bulky (>5cm) lymphadenopathy 
(BF-ref). (6) Ofatumumab was given weekly x 8 doses followed by [CONTACT_496430] x 4. 
Results of a planned interim analysis included 138 treated patients with FA -ref (n = 59) 
and BF -ref (n = 79) CLL. The overall response rates (primary end point) were 58% 
[corrected] and 47% in the FA -ref and BF -ref groups, respectively. Complete resolution 
of constitut ional symptoms and improved performance status occurred in 57% and 48% 
 Confidential  Page 22 of 92  
                                           
 
Amendment 5 Dated 03/02/[ADDRESS_638127] common adverse events during treatment were 
infusion reactions and infections, which were primarily, grade 1 or 2 events. Hematologic 
events during treatment included anemia and neutropenia. These encouraging results in 
patien ts with refractory CLL warrant further investigation of ofatumumab in combination  
with other agents and as maintenance for the treatment of patients with CLL.  
 
 
A Phase II trial of single agent lenalidomide in patients with relapsed or ref ractory CLL 
revealed an ORR of 47% with a CR rate of 9%.  (8) Another phase II trial of single agent 
lenalidomide for the treatment of relapsed or refractory CLL revealed an ORR of 32% 
with 7% CR, 25% stable disease. The most common toxicity was myelosuppression, and 
the median dail y dose of lenalidomide tolerated was 10 mg.  (9) More recently two 
combination trials of lenalidomide and rituximab have  been reported in abstract form 
from our center  (10) and MDACC .(11) Both these studies evaluated patients in the relapsed 
setting and had an overall response rate of 60%.   
 
Our hypothesis is that ofatumumab will produce higher rates of CR when combined with 
lenalidomide and high dose steroids . The consolidation with lenalidomide is based on the 
fact that this drug has  activity in CLL but is not immunosuppress ive. In addition , there is 
evidence that lenalidomide can  improve the immune system of patients with CLL as well 
as inc rease the rates of CR in this  population. The reason for incorporating lenalidomide 
after debulking patients with high dose steroids and ofatumumab is based on the 
experience with lenalidomide as a single agent in the relapsed and front line setting.  In 
this setting tumor lysis syndrome and tumor flare were observed. We believe that this 
sequence of drugs will carry less toxicity and will be better tolerated.

 high dose methylprednisolone , followed by [CONTACT_496439].  
The study has 2 stages (see study schema in section 1).  Stage 1 is an induction phase and 
incorporates cycles 1 -3 (see table1 for drug dosing).  Stage 2 is a maintenance phase and 
incorporate s cycles 4 -12.  After stage 1 (cycle 3) all patients will be assessed for response 
(see section 7, Response criteria).  Patients with a CR, PR, or SD will then proceed to the 
2nd stage of treatment (cycles 4 -12).  Patients with disease progression will be removed 
from the study .  Patients continuing on the study will then be reassessed at the end of 
treatment.

racemi c mixture with a net optical rotation of zero.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Pharmacology 
Mechanism of Action:  
The mechanism of action of lenalidomide remains to be fully characterized. 
Lenalidomide possesses immunomodulatory and antiangiogenic properties.  
Lenalidomi de inhibited the secretion of pro- inflammatory cytokines and increased the 
secretion of anti -inflammatory cytokines from peripheral blood mononuclear cells.  
Lenalidomide inhibited cell proliferation with varying effectiveness (IC50s) in some but 
not all cell lines.  Of cell lines tested, lenalidomide was effective in inhibiting growth of 
Namalwa cells (a human B cell lymphoma cell line with a deletion of one chromosome 5) 
but was much less effective in inhibiting growth of KG -1 cells (human myeloblastic ce ll 
line, also with a deletion of one chromosome 5) and other cell lines without chromosome 5 deletions.  Lenalidomide inhibited the expression of cyclooxygenase -2 (COX -2) but not 
COX- 1 in vitro.    
[IP_ADDRESS]  Pharmacokinetics and Drug Metabolism:  
Absorption:  
Lenalidomide, in healthy volunteers, is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_210801] 0.[ADDRESS_638130] -dose. 
Co-administration with food does not alter the extent of absorption (AUC) but does 
reduce the maximal plasma concentration (Cmax) by 36%. The pharmacokinetic 
disposition of lenalidomide is linear. Cmax and AUC increase proportionately with increases in dose. Multiple dosing at the recommended dose- regimen does not result in  
drug accumulati on. 
Pharmacokinetic analyses were performed on 15 multiple myeloma patients treated in the 
phase I studies.  Absorption was found to be rapid on both Day 1 and Day 28 with time to 
maximum blood levels ranging from 0.7 to 2.0 hours at all dose levels (5mg, 10mg, 
 Confidential  Page 26 of 92

 25mg, and 50mg).  No plasma accumulation was observed with multiple daily dosing.  
Plasma lenalidomide declined in a monophasic manner with elimination half -life ranging 
from 2.8 to 6.1 hours on both Day 1 and 28 at all 4 doses.  Peak and overall pla sma 
concentrations were dose proportional over the dosing range of 5mg to 50mg.  Exposure 
(AUC) in multiple myeloma patients is 57% higher than in healthy male volunteers.  
Pharmacokinetic Parameters:  
Distribution:  
In vitro (14C)-lenalidomide binding to pl asma proteins is approximately 30%.  
Metabolism and Excretion:  
The metabolic profile of lenalidomide in humans has not been studied. In healthy volunteers, approximately two -thirds of lenalidomide is eliminated unchanged through 
urinary excretion. The proce ss exceeds the glomerular filtration rate and therefore is 
partially or entirely active.  Half -life of elimination is approximately 3 hours.

5.2.2 Ofatumumab  
Ofatumumab  (ARZERRA)  is an IgG1ĸ human monoclonal antibody (mAb) that 
specifically recognizes epi[INVESTIGATOR_370304]20 molecule on B cells. The antibody is generated via transgenic mouse and hybridoma technology and produced in a 
recombinant murine cell line (NS0) using sta ndard mammalian cell cultivation and 
purification technologies.  
 
Ofatumumab represents a novel anti -CD20 mAb, as it binds to a CD20 epi[INVESTIGATOR_496414]. Ofatumumab is superior in CDC and its ability 
to kill rituximab  resistant  tumors as compared to rituximab. Based on the data from the 
non-clinical investigations of  ofatumumab it is suggested that  ofatumumab may deplete B 
cells for a longer period of time than rituximab, which may lead to a longer duration of 
treatment  response and could potentially result in less dose needed.  Ofatumumab is a 
human mAb with an anticipated very low immunogenicity. Therefore,  subjects are not 
expected to produce human anti -human antibodies (HAHA) to the same  degree as to the 
human anti -chimeric antibodies (HACA) seen in some subjects following  rituximab 
treatment.

was approximately 14 days (range: 2.3 to 61.5 days).  
 
Special Populations : Cross -study analyses were performed on data from patients with a 
variety of conditions, including 162 patients with CLL, who received multiple infusions of ofatumumab as a sin gle agent at doses ranging from 100 to 2,000 mg. The effects of 
various covariates (e.g., body size [weight, height, and body  surface area], age, gender, 
baseline creatinine clearance) on ofatumumab pharmacokinetics were assessed in a 
population pharmacoki netic analysis.  
Body Weight: Volume of distribution and clearance increased with body weight. 
However, this increase was not clinically significant. No dosage adjustment is 
recommended based on body weight.  
Age: Age did not significantly influence ofatum umab pharmacokinetics in patients 
ranging from 21 to 86 years of age.  
Gender: Gender had a modest effect on ofatumumab pharmacokinetics (14% to 25% 
lower clearance and volume of distribution in female patients compared to male patients) in a cross -study p opulation analysis (41% of the patients in this analysis were male and 
59% were female). These effects are not considered clinically important, and no dosage adjustment is recommended.  
Renal Impairment: Creatinine clearance at baseline did not have a clin ically important 
effect on ofatumumab pharmacokinetics in patients with calculated creatinine clearance 
values ranging from 33 to 287 mL/min.

 [IP_ADDRESS] Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS) Prophylaxis (allopurinol and hydra tion)  
Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS), characterized by [CONTACT_496446], hyperuricemia, and 
hyperphosphatemia resulting from the rapid release of potassium, uric acid, and 
phosphate, has been reported in CLL patients treated with lenalidomide necessitating 
TLS pro phylaxis including allopurinol and oral hydration.  The risk of TLS is highest 
during the first cycle of therapy and decreases after resolution of lymphocytosis. Allopurinol 300mg po daily will be given at the beginning at least [ADDRESS_638161]’s cardiovascular status indicates the possibility of volume overload.  Based on clinical and laboratory 
parameters, TLS prophylaxis may be continued or restarted as needed at  the 
Investigator’s discretion.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Anticoagulation Consideration   
Lenalidomide increases the risk of thrombotic events in patients who are at high risk or 
with a history a thrombosis, in particular when combined with other drugs known to 
cause thrombosis. Wh en lenalidomide is combined with other agents such as steroids 
(e.g. dexamethasone, prednisone), anthracyclines (Doxil, Adriamycin) and erythropoietin the risk of thrombosis is increased.  For information on the risk of venous 
thromboembolism with combined oral contraception see Appendix: Risks of Fetal 
Exposure, Pregnancy Testing Guidelines and Acceptable Birth Control Methods.  
All patients should receive prophylactic anti -coagulation.  Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] (81 or 325 mg) is the 
recommended agent for anti -coagulation p rophylaxis.  Low molecular weight heparin

 may be utilized in patients that are intolerant to ASA. Coumadin should be used with 
caution and close monitoring of INR.  
Patients with a history of venous thromboembolism should be closely monitored throughout the  study, especially during periods of fluctuating platelet counts.  
Prophylactic anti- coagulation should be held for platelet counts < 50,000/mm ³ 
and then restarted when platelet counts are above this level.  
Full therapeutic anti- coagulation should be consi dered for patients who have a history of 
venous thromboembolism.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Treatment and Dose Modification for Tumor Lysis Syndrome  
All subjects meeting criteria of laboratory TLS or ≥ Grade 1 TLS according to the Cairo -
Bishop Definition of Tumor Lysis Syndrome (see Appendix) should receive vigorous 
intravenous hydration and should be considered for rasburicase therapy as needed to 
reduce hyperuricemia, until correction of electrolyte abnormalities.   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Tumor Flare Reaction (TFR):  
Prophylaxis for (TFR) is not recommended.  Grade 1 TFR may be treated with NSAIDs 
(i.e. ibuprofen 400 -600 mg orally every 4-6 hours as needed).  TFR ≥ Grade 2 may be 
treated with corticosteroids.  Narcotic analgesics may be added as needed for pain control in subjects experiencing ≥ Grade 2 tumor flare.  If corticosteroids are used, the following 
dosage schedule is recommended; prednisone 20mg PO QD x [ADDRESS_638162] 2 weeks of Cycle 4 of treatment protocol should be 
recorded as an adverse event and not as progressive disease (PD).  For tumor flare 
occurring after the first 2 weeks of Cycle 4 of treatment protocol, differentiate tumor flare 
from progression.

 1“Life -threatening” means that the subject was at immediate risk of death at the time of the serious adverse event; it 
does not refer to a serious adverse event that hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.  
2“Persistent or significant disability or incapacity” means that there is a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to

situations where none of the outcomes listed above occurred.  Important medical events that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_496418].  Examples of such events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or 
drug abuse.  A new diagnosis of cancer during the course of a treatment should be considered as medically im portant.

Toxicity will be scored using CTCAE Version 4.0 for toxicity and adverse event 
reporting.  A copy of the CTCAE Version 4.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP 
homepage ( HTTP://CTEP.INFO.NIH.GOV ).  All appropriate treatment areas should

Amendment 5 Dated 03/02/[ADDRESS_638180] be informed according to NOVARTIS  Serious Adverse Event 
Definitions.  
 
Adverse Events:  
Any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical investigation subject, 
temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered 
related to the medicinal product.  
Events meeting the definition of an AE include:  
• Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology, clinical chemistry, or urinalysis) 
or other safety assessments e.g., ECGs, radi ological scans, vital signs 
measurements), including those that worsen from baseline, and felt to be clinically significant in the medic al and scientific judgment of the investigator  
• Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition including either an 
increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition  
• New conditions detected or diagnosed after investigational product administration 
even though it may have been present prior to the start of the study  
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected interaction  
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either 
investigational product or a concomitant medication (overdose per se will not be reported as an AE/SAE)  
“Lack of efficacy” or “failure of expected pharmacological action” per se will not be reported as an AE or SAE. However, the signs and symptoms and/or clinical sequelae 
resulting from lack of efficacy will be reported if they fulfill the definition of an AE or SAE.  
Events that do not  meet th e definition of an AE include:

Amendment 5 Dated 03/02/2016 
 • Any clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding or other abnormal safety 
assessments that is associated with the underlying disease, unless judged by [CONTACT_1173]’s c ondition.  
• The disease/disorder being studied, or expected progression, signs, or symptoms of the disease/disorder being studied, unless more severe than expected for the subject’s 
condition 
• Medical or surgical procedure (e.g., endoscopy, appendectomy); th e condition that 
leads to the procedure is an AE  
• Situations where an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307])  
• Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) present 
or det ected at the start of the study that do not worsen  
• B cell depletion and hypogammaglobulinemia due to ofatumumab treatment  
6.2.1 Definition of a  Serious Adverse Event ( SAE ) 
An SAE is  an Adverse Event  that, at any dose:  
a. Results in death  
b. Is life -threatening  
NOTE:  The term 'life -threatening' in the definition of 'serious' refers to an event in 
which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event.  It does not refer to an event, which hypothetically might have caused death, if it were more severe.  
c. Requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12331]:  In general, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5184] 
(usually involving at least an overnight stay) at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1083]/or tre atment that would not have been appropriate in the physician’s 
office or out -patient setting.  Complications that occur during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_23918].  If a complication prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9236],

Amendment 5 Dated 03/02/2016 
 the event is serious .  When in doubt as to whether “hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” occurred or was 
necessary, the AE should be considered serious.  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5187] a pre -existing condition that did not worsen 
from baseline is not considered an AE. 
An overnight hospi[INVESTIGATOR_376770] a Serious 
Adverse Event.  
d. Results in disability/incapacity, or  
NOTE:  The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to 
conduct normal life functions.  This definition  is not intended to include experiences 
of relatively minor medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (e.g. sprained ankle) which may 
interfere or prevent everyday life functions but d o not constitute a substantial 
disruption.  
e. Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
f. Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether reporting is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be 
immediatel y life -threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_299444].  These should also be considered 
serious.  Examples  of such events are invasive or malignant cancers, intensive 
treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or development of 
drug dependency or drug abuse.  
6.2.2 Labora tory and Other Safety Assessment Abnormalities Reported as AEs 
and SAEs  
• Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology, clinical chemistry, or urinalysis) or other safety assessments (e.g., ECGs, radiological scans, vital signs

clinically significant in the medical and scientific judgment of the investigator are 
to be recorded as AEs or SAEs.  
 
• All events meeting liver stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_248232].  
• However, any clinically significant safety assessments that are associated with the 
underlying disease, unless judged by [CONTACT_301913]’s condition, are not to be reported as AEs or SAEs.  
• B cell depletion, IgG below LLN, low CD19+ count, and 
hypogammaglobulinemia due to treatment with ofatumumab are not to be 
reported as AEs or SAEs.  
• Infusion related AEs may lead to a prolonged infusion time. Overnight stay at the

6.2.3 Disease -Related Events and/or Disease- Related Outcomes Not Qualifying as 
SAEs  
An event which is part of the natural course of the disease under study (i.e., disease progression) does not need to be reported as an SAE.  However, if the progression of the 
underlying disease is greater than that which would normally be expected for the subject, 
or if the investigator considers that there was a causal relationship between treatment 
with investigational product or protocol design/procedures and the disease progression, 
then this must be reported as an SAE. 
6.2.[ADDRESS_638181] (minimum 
of 6 months or until the end of the follow -up period which ever is longer). All SAEs 
regardless of causality will be collected until the end of the follow -up period.

assessed as related to study participation (e.g., protoc ol-mandated procedures, invasive 
tests, or change in existing therapy) or related to NOVARTIS  concomitant medication, 
will be reported promptly to NOVARTIS . 
 Any SAE brought to the investigator’s attention after the subject has completed the study 
and cons idered by [CONTACT_496448] . 
This includes serious, related, not related, labeled (expected) and, unlabeled (unexpected) 
adverse experiences. All deaths during treatment or within [ADDRESS_638183] be kept within the Trial Master File at the study site.  
Follow -up information is sent to the same fax number as the original SAE Report Form 
was sent, using a new fax cover sheet, stating that this is a follow -up to the previously 
reported SAE, and giving the date of the original report. Each re-occurrence, 
complication, or progression of the original event should be reported as a follow -up to 
that event regardless of when it occurs. The follow -up information should describe 
whether the event has resolved or continues, if and how it was treated  and whether the 
patient continued or withdrew from study participation.  
If the SAE is not previously documented in the Ofatumumab Investigator Brochure or 
Package Insert (new occurrence) and is thought to be related to the [COMPANY_001] study drug, a DS&E asso ciate may urgently require further information from the investigator for 
Health Authority reporting. [COMPANY_001] may need to issue an Investigator Notification (IN), to inform all investigators involved in any study with the same drug that this SAE has

Data will be analyzed and reported after completion of treatment protocol . All subsequent 
data collected will be analyzed and reported in a follow -up clinical report.  
9.2 Study auditing  
9.2.1 Investigator responsibilities  
Investigator responsibilities are set out in the ICH guideline for Good Clinical Practice 
(GCP) and in the US Code of Federal Regulatio ns. 
Investigators must enter study data onto CRFs or other data collection system.  The Investigator will permit study -related audits by [CONTACT_193089], IRB/EC 
review, and regulatory inspec tion(s) (e.g., FDA, EMEA, TPP), providing direct a ccess to 
the facilities where the study took place, to source documents, to CRFs, and to all other 
study documents.

Amendment 5 Dated 03/02/2016 
 9.2.2  Internal Monitoring  
Data will be captured in Oncore, Moffitt’s Clinical Trials Database.   The Case Report 
Forms will be reviewed by  [CONTACT_38061]’s Internal Monitors, periodically, approximately every 
[ADDRESS_638192] of the trial.  The monitoring will include source data 
verification utilizing research subjects’ medical records.  
10   Statistical Considerations  
10.1 Study Design/ Endpoints  
This is a phase II, single institution, and non -randomized study of patients with untreated 
CLL/SLL, utilizing a two -stage trial design. The primary endpoint for this trial is the 
combined complete and partial response rate (at 3 months -the end of cycle 3)  to the 
protocol therapy. We anticipate this trial will have a CR+PR response rate of at least 
80%.  
A two -stage design is employed for this trial. The null/unacceptable CR+PR response 
rate is ≤60% while the anticipated true response rate to the protocol t reatment is at least 
80% for each disease cohort. At the first stage, 26 patients will be accrued to the trial. If 
15 or fewer of these patients respond, then the trial will be terminated early and the 
response rate to the protocol treatment will be deemed  unacceptable (≤60%). Otherwise, 
if more than [ADDRESS_638193] stage, an additional 19 patients will be enrolled to this trial during stage 2 for a total of 45 patients. If 32 or fewer of these 45 
patients respond to the protocol treatm ent at the end of stage 2, no further investigation of 
the protocol treatment is considered warranted. On the other hand, if more than 32 patients out of the 45 enrolled patients respond, the protocol treatment will be considered 
promising. If the true res ponse rate is ≤60%, the probability of ending the trial at stage [ADDRESS_638194] 80%, then the probability of ending the trial at stage 1 is only 0.01. This two -stage design has an overall alpha level of 0.045 
and a power of 0.90.

Amendment 5 Dated 03/02/2016 
 10.2 Sample Size/Accrual Rate  
Up to 45 patients will be enrolled into this study. During the interim analysis at the end of 
stage 1, the patie nt accrual to the trial will not be suspended while pending the interim 
analysis results unless th e observed objective response rate among those patients whose 
objective respons e data are available is below 55 %. The accrual rate will be 
approximately 2 -3 patients per month. The entire accrual for this trial should be 
completed in about 1.5 years.  
10.3 Stratification Factors  
There are no stratification factors planned for this study.  
10.4 Data Analysis, Reporting and Exclusions Regarding Efficacy Endpoints  
The objective response (CR+PR) rate will be summarized using both a point estimate and 
its exact confidence interval based on the binomial distribution.  
Progression -free survival (PFS), defined as the time from study entry to disease 
progression, relapse or death due to any cause, whichever is earlier, will be summarized 
with the Kaplan -Meier curve. Confidence intervals for the median and survival rates at 
different time points will be constructed if needed. The other secondary endpoint, overall survival (OS), will be analyzed similarly. Both of these two secondary endpoints will be 
reported descriptively. 
The i ntent -to-treat approach will be used for data analysis of this trial. That means all 
patients who receive at least one dose of the protocol treatment will be included in the 
interim and final data analyses. Patients who are lost to follow -up or drop out of  study 
prior to their scheduled response evaluation time due to any reason will be treated as non -
responders for response determination and censored for time -to-event type of endpoints 
at the time of their last assessment/follow -up if no relevant event has  occurred by [CONTACT_221774]. A 
secondary analysis that includes only all eligible patients may be conducted in addition to 
the primary analysis described above at the discretion of the trial PI [INVESTIGATOR_196054]. Other subanalyses may also be considered on t he basis of a subset of 
patients, excluding those for whom major protocol deviations have been identified (e.g., early discontinuation of treatment, major protocol violations, etc.).  However, these 
 Confidential  Page 75 of 92  
                                           
 
Amendment 5 Dated 03/02/[ADDRESS_638195] be assessed for response to treatment, even if there 
are major protocol treatment deviations or if they are ineligible.  Each patient will be assigned one of the following categories: 1) complete response, 2) partial response, 3) 
stable disease, 4) progressive disease, 5) early death from malignant disease, 6) early 
death from toxicity, 7) early death because of other cause, or 9) unknown (not assessable, 
insufficient data).  [Note: By [CONTACT_480], category 9 usually designates the 
“unknown” status of any type of data in a clinical database.]  
Patients in response categories 4 -9 should be considered as failing to respond to treatment 
(disease progression).  Thus, an incorrect treatment schedule or drug administra tion does 
not result in exclusion from the analysis of the response rate.

Amendment 5 Dated 03/02/[ADDRESS_638196]/Ethics Committee approval  
The protocol for this study has been designed in accordance with the general ethical 
principle s outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki.  The review of this protocol by [CONTACT_5040]/EC and the performance of all aspects of the study, including the methods used for obtaining informed consent, must also be in accordance with principles enunciated in the 
declaration, as well as ICH Guidelines, Title  21 of the Code of Federal Regulations 
(CFR), Part 50 Protection of Human Subjects and Part 56 Institutional Review Boards. 
The Investigator will be responsible for preparing documents for submission to the 
relevant IRB/EC and obtaining written approval for this study.  The approval will be 
obtained prior to the initiation of the study. 
The approval for both the protocol and informed consent must specify the date of 
approval, protocol number and version, or a mendment number.  
Any amendments to the protocol after receipt of IRB/EC approval must be submitted by [CONTACT_26492]/EC for approval.  The Investigator is also responsible for 
notifying the IRB/EC of any serious deviations from the protocol, or anything else that 
may involve added risk to subjects.  
Any advertisements used to recruit subjects for the study must be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_1201]/EC prior to use.

 12 Appendices  
Appendix  A: Risks of Fetal Exposure, Pregnancy Testing Guidelines and Acceptable 
Birth Control Methods  
Risks Associated with Pregnancy  
The use of lenalidomide in pregnant females and nursing mothers has not been studied 
nor has the effect of the lenalidomide on human eggs and sperm.  Lenalidomide is 
structurally related to thalidomide.  Thalidomide is a known human teratogenic active 
substance that causes severe life -threatening birth defects.  An embryofetal development 
study in animals indicates that lenalidomide produced malformations in the offspr ing of 
female monkeys who received the drug during pregnancy.  The teratogenic effect of 
lenalidomide in humans cannot be ruled out.  Therefore, a risk minimization plan to 
prevent pregnancy must be observed.  
All study participants must be registered into the mandatory REMS ® program, and be  
willing and able to comply with the requirements of REMS ®. 
Criteria for females of childbearing potential (FCBP)  
This protocol defines a female of childbearing potential as a sexually mature female who: 
1) has not underg one a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy or 2) has not been 
naturally postmenopausal for at least 24 consecutive months (i.e., has had menses at any time in the preceding 24 consecutive months).  
The investigator must ensure that:  
• Females of childbearin g potential comply with the conditions for pregnancy risk 
minimization, including confirmation that she has an adequate level of understanding 
• Females NOT of childbearing potential acknowledge that she understands the hazards and necessary precautions associated with the use of lenalidomide

Amendment 5 Dated 03/02/2016 
 • Male patients taking lenalidomide acknowledge that he understands that traces of 
lenalidomide have been found in semen, that he understands the potential teratogenic risk if engaged in sexual activity with a female of ch ildbearing 
potential, and that he understands the need for the use of a condom even if he has had a vasectomy, if engaged in sexual activity with a female of childbearing 
potential.   
Contraception  
Females of childbearing potential (FCBP) enrolled in this protocol must agree to use two 
reliable forms of contraception simultaneously or to practice complete abstinence from heterosexual intercourse during the following time periods related to this study: 1) for at 
least 28 days before starting lenalidomide; 2)  throughout the entire duration of 
lenalidomide treatment; 3) during dose interruptions; and 4) for at least [ADDRESS_638202] include one highly effective method and one additional effective (barrier) method. FCBP must be referred to a qualified provider 
of contraceptive methods if needed. The following are examples of highly effective and additional effective methods of contraception:   
o Highly effective methods: 
 Intrauterine device (IUD)  
 Hormonal (birth control pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], injections, implants)  
 Tubal ligation  
 Partner’s vasectomy  
o Additional effective methods:  
 Male condom  
 Diaphragm  
 Cervical Cap

Amendment 5 Dated 03/02/2016 
 Because of the increased risk of venous thromboembolism in patients with multiple 
myeloma taking lenalidomide and dexamethasone, combined oral contraceptive pi[INVESTIGATOR_196989].  If a patient is currently using combined oral contraception the patient should switch to one of the effective method listed above.  The risk of venous 
thromboembolism c ontinues for 4−6 weeks after discontinuing combined oral 
contraception. The efficacy of contraceptive steroids may be reduced during co -treatment 
with dexamethasone.  
Implants and levonorgestrel -releasing intrauterine systems are associated with an 
increased risk of infection at the time of insertion and irregular vaginal bleeding. 
Prophylactic antibiotics should be considered particularly in patients with neutropenia.  
Pregnancy testing  
Medically supervised pregnancy tests with a minimum sensitivity of 50 mIU/mL must be 
performed for females of childbearing potential, including females of childbearing potential who commit to complete abstinence, as outlined below.  
Before starting lenalidomide 
Female Patients:  
FCBP must have two negative pregnancy tests ( sensitivity of at least 50 mIU/mL) prior to 
prescribing lenalidomide.  The first pregnancy test must be performed within 10- [ADDRESS_638203] be performed 
within 24 hours prior to prescribing lenal idomide.  The patient may not receive 
lenalidomide until the Investigator has verified that the results of these pregnancy tests are negative.  
Male Patients : 
Must agree to practice complete abstinence or agree to use a condom during sexual 
contact [CONTACT_496451], during dose interruptions and for at least 28 days following lenalidomide discontinuation, even if he has undergone a successful 
vasectomy.

Amendment 5 Dated 03/02/2016 
 Durin g study participation and for 28 days following lenalidomide discontinuation  
Female Patients:  
• FCBP with regular or no menstrual cycles must agree to have pregnancy tests 
weekly for the first [ADDRESS_638204] 28 days of lenalidomide treatment, including dose interruptions, and then 
every 14 days throughout the remaining duration of lenalidomide treatment, 
including dose interruptions, at lenalidomide discontinuation, and at Day 14 and 
Day 28 following lenalidomide discontinuation.   
• At each visit, the Investigator must confirm with the FCBP that she is continuing 
to use two reliable methods of birth control at each visit during the time that birth control is required.   
• If preg nancy or a positive pregnancy test does occur in a study patient, 
lenalidomide must be immediately discontinued.  
• Pregnancy testing and counseling must be performed if a patient misses her period or if her pregnancy test or her menstrual bleeding is abnorma l.  Lenalidomide 
treatment must be temporarily discontinued during this evaluation.  
• Females must agree to abstain from breastfeeding during study participation and for at least 28 days after lenalidomide discontinuation.  
Male Patients:  
• Must practice complete abstinence or use a condom during sexual contact [CONTACT_197014], during dose interruptions and for at least 28

successful vasectomy.   
• If pregnancy or a positive pregnancy test does occur in the partner of a male study patient during study participation, the investigator must be notified immediately.  
Additional pre cautions  
• Patients should be instructed never to give lenalidomide to another person.  
• Female patients should not donate blood during therapy and for at least 28 days 
following discontinuation of lenalidomide.  
• Male patients should not donate blood, semen or sperm during therapy or for at 
least 28 days following discontinuation of lenalidomide.  
• Only enough lenalidomide for one cycle of therapy may be prescribed with each 
cycle of therapy.

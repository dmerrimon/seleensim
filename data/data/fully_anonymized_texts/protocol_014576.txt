1.0  Background
1.1 Cognitive Impairment in Cancer Patients as a Public Health Problem
Due to the decreasing mortality rate of cancer, there are more than 10 million 
cancer survivors in the [LOCATION_002].[1, 2] Because many of these survivors do 
not succumb to cancer, other health problems, including cognitive difficulties due 
to treatment, are a major concern. 
Up to 75% of cancer patients will experience some form of cognitive impairment 
(e.g. problems with memory, attention, and executive functioning) during the 
treatment of their cancer and, for many, this impairment will persist for many 
months or years following treatment.[3-7] Cognitive problems in those who receive 
chemotherapy are more severe than in those who receive locoregional therapy 
(e.g. radiation, surgery).[5] These cognitive problems can negatively impact 
activities of daily living such as 1) performance at work, 2) caring for family 
members and 3) accessing necessary medical and other health services. Until 
the past decade, this condition was largely under-studied, and no effective 
RSRB # [ZIP_CODE]                                        Page 4 of 46          Version Date: January 31, 2018treatment exists. 
1.2 The Etiology of Chemotherapy-Related Cognitive Impairment: A Possible 
Link Between Cognitive Impairment and Inflammation   
The etiology of cognitive impairment in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy 
is unknown, but some clues have been identified. Findings from a small number 
of neuroimaging studies have shown that chemotherapy affects specific brain 
regions. Location-specific brain dysfunction is supported by [CONTACT_835248] (MRI) studies that have identified abnormalities in brain metabolism and 
blood flow in areas involved in cognition including the prefrontal lobe, 
hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, cingulate gyrus, and precuneus regions.[8, 
9] Whether chemotherapeutic agents can enter the brain at high enough levels to 
cause direct neurotoxicity leading to these abnormalities—or whether these 
effects on metabolism are indirect—is unknown.
Recent literature suggests that elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines may 
be causally related to cognitive problems in cancer patients.[10] Over three 
decades ago, the brain was considered an immune-privileged organ due to tight 
regulation by [CONTACT_835249]-resident lymph nodes. 
Now, we appreciate an immunological capacity within the brain. For instance, 
although at low levels, cytokine-producing T lymphocytes can be identified within 
the brain,[11] and neurons, astrocytes, and microglia have all been found capable 
of pro-inflammatory cytokine production.[12] We also know that interaction occurs 
between the peripheral blood and the CNS; increased levels of pro-inflammatory 
molecules in the peripheral blood can induce CNS glial changes, subsequent 
cytokine production, and cognitive problems (e.g. memory).[13-16] Many of the 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_835228]; [17] inflammatory processes are now 
implicated in a number of these disorders including Alzheimer’s disease (AD), 
Parkinson’s disease (PD), multiple sclerosis (MS), and human immunodeficiency 
type 1 dementia. For example, a recent small-scale prospective clinical study 
revealed that high peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) production of IL-1 
and TNF- correlates with a higher risk of the subsequent development of AD.[18] 
Additionally, traumatic brain injury (TBI) early in life—with the consequent 
elevation of inflammatory mediators—and the later development of AD are 
positively correlated in some studies,[19] suggesting that a heightened 
inflammatory status may contribute to cognitive difficulties. 
Recent studies have shown that elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines are a 
consequence of immunotherapy, immunotherapy in combination with 
chemotherapy, and chemotherapy alone, and it is therefore plausible that these 
elevated levels of cytokines play a role in cognitive difficulties in cancer patients. 
For example, studies in cancer patients who have received high doses of IL-2 
and IFN-alpha,[20] or interferon-alpha and chemotherapy[21] for treatment of 
cancer have been conducted; both of these studies revealed associations of 
RSRB # [ZIP_CODE]                                        Page 5 of 46          Version Date: January 31, 2018treatment with cognitive problems in this population. Interleukin-2 immunotherapy 
leads to impairments in spatial working memory and IFN-alpha immunotherapy 
leads to impairments in reaction time,[20] while IFN-alpha plus chemotherapy 
leads to problems in spatial working memory.[21] Chemotherapy has also been 
associated with increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-1β [22], and 
alterations in IL-6, IL-8, and TNF- levels.[23] 
My data from mice show that cyclophosphamide chemotherapy increased blood 
levels of the inflammatory molecule MCP-1 (Fig. 1A), increased microglial 
activation (indicating brain inflammation, Fig. 1C) and reduced neural precursor 
proliferation (implicating impaired memory processes, Fig. 1B, [24]). Collectively, 
these data from human and animal studies suggest that chemotherapy elicits an 
inflammatory response that might produce neural cell damage and impaired 
cognitive functioning.   These studies support our hypothesis that inflammation 
may contribute to chemotherapy-related cognitive difficulties in cancer patients. 
Possible mechanisms for explaining how heightened levels of pro-inflammatory 
cytokines due to cancer and cancer treatment may contribute directly to 
problems in cognitive functioning include 1) activation of the blood brain barrier to 
induce glial changes and subsequent cytokine production in the CNS, 2) creation 
of leakiness in the blood brain barrier causing increased concentrations of toxic 
substances to enter the brain, and 3) interaction with the vagus nerve triggering 
central nervous system induced inflammatory signals. 
We propose a model whereby [CONTACT_835250]-inflammatory molecules that 
activate the blood brain barrier, allowing for brain inflammation and associated 
problems in cognition. Moreover, interventions (e.g. exercise, anti-inflammatory 
medication) aimed at dampening chronic inflammation will alleviate cognitive 
problems experienced by [CONTACT_835251] (Figure 2)*p < 0.005Figure 1

and interventions to inhibit inflammation. 
Model: Chemotherapy likely leads to heightened peripheral blood levels of 
cytokines causing sustained inflammation which, in turn, activates the blood brain 
barrier and causes CNS inflammation. Chronic CNS inflammation leads to 
neurotoxicity and cognitive difficulties. Interventions that reduce inflammation, 
such as exercise and ibuprofen, can dampen the inflammatory response caused 
by [CONTACT_835252].  
1.3 Exercise as an intervention to reduce inflammation and treat cognitive 
impairment
Increasing evidence suggests that exercise improves functional capacity and 
quality of life (QOL) in cancer survivors [25-27] and may provide a useful 
intervention for reducing symptom burden resulting from treatment in this 
population. These positive outcomes may be linked in part to the overall anti-
inflammatory effects of exercise. For example, exercise may help to maintain or 
reduce body fat, a source of highly inflammatory adipose tissue.[28, 29] Regular 
aerobic exercise can reduce levels of circulating cytokines (e.g. IL-6, CRP) and 
both aerobic exercise and resistance training each can reduce TNF-alpha [30] in 
older adults. A ten-week walking program also demonstrated a reduction in IL-6 
and psychological stress.[31]   
Exercise may particularly be a good intervention to reduce inflammation in 
women receiving chemotherapy. These women tend to gain weight, which is 
largely attributed to an increase in fat mass (adiposity) [32-34]. Increases in 
adiposity lead to increases in inflammation within the body that we hypothesize 
contribute to cognitive difficulties in cancer patients.  IbuprofenChemotherapy

controlled trial examined the effects of a 6-month home-based exercise 
intervention in [ADDRESS_1159802]-intervention. [36]  
Exercise interventions in cancer patients are feasible and safe. Mustian and 
colleagues,[37]   Cramp and colleagues, [38]  Galvao and Newton,[39]  Stevinsen 
and colleagues, [40]  and Knols and colleagues [41] report on the benefits of 
exercise among cancer survivors during and after treatment.  Exercise has been 
shown to improve Cancer-Related Fatigue (CRF), QOL, emotional distress, 
immunological parameters, aerobic capacity, strength, flexibility, and body 
composition in these studies.  Fourteen of these studies by [CONTACT_835253].  
We performed secondary analyses on a pi[INVESTIGATOR_835231]. 
Mustian, a Co-Investigator on this study, that compared the effects of a 12-week 
exercise (Tai Chi Chuan)  intervention to a non-exercise control group on 
functional capacity and quality of life in [ADDRESS_1159803] cancer survivors.[25] In this 
study, subjects were also asked about forgetfulness on a 5-point scale (0 = not at 
all to 4 = extremely) prior to the intervention, halfway through the intervention, 
and post-intervention. While significance was not reached, a trend toward 
improvement (p=0.12) was observed from the pre-intervention to post-
intervention time-points (see Figure 3 below) for the exercise group. 
Figure [ADDRESS_1159804]. Mustian, has been validated and safety-tested in 
cancer patients undergoing radiation treatment and is associated with 
improved functional capacity, reduced fatigue, and altered cytokine levels

a multi-center clinical trial for effects on fatigue in cancer patients 
undergoing chemotherapy through the URCC NCORP and affiliates. 
1.4 Ibuprofen as an intervention to reduce inflammation and treat cognitive 
impairment
Ibuprofen is a non-selective non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent (NSAID) that is 
FDA-approved for treatment of numerous conditions including pain, headache, 
fever, and inflammation. Ibuprofen inhibits cyclooxygenase 1 and 2 activity, 
thereby [CONTACT_835254] (e.g. PGE2) and consequently 
down-regulating inflammatory pathways involving IL-1β, TNF-, MCP-[ADDRESS_1159805] positive 
effects on cognitive functioning in the setting of neurodegenerative disease.  A 
recent case-control study assessing the effects of anti-inflammatory medication 
on risk of Alzheimer’s disease revealed a 44% reduction in risk with long-term 
usage (> 2 years), although prospective studies have been inconsistent. [46]
Long-term NSAID usage, particularly ibuprofen, also has been associated with 
better cognitive performance and lower rates of cognitive decline in a study of 
healthy older adults. [47]
1.4.1. The value of low-dose, short-term usage of an anti-inflammatory on 
cognitive function has not been investigated, and assessing such usage 
for preliminary effectiveness in cancer patients is the primary goal of this 
study.

EXCAP, alone or together, on cognitive function and levels of 
inflammatory molecules (MCP-1, TNF-, IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, PGE2) among 
cancer patients receiving chemotherapy.  If these interventions prove to 
be useful and have a potential benefit, they could have a substantial 
impact on treating cognitive difficulties experienced by [CONTACT_835255], at 
work, and in interpersonal relationships. Moreover, if there is an effect of 
these interventions on cognitive functioning and inflammation, we will gain 
more knowledge of a possible mechanism of chemotherapy-related 
cognitive difficulties.

5.0  Treatment Protocol
5.1 This will be a four-arm feasibility clinical trial of an intervention examining 
the preliminary efficacy of ibuprofen 200 mg BID alone, a structured 
home-based walking/progressive resistance exercise program alone, and 
the combination of ibuprofen 200 mg BID and a structured home-based

start of or after their first chemotherapy treatment.  If interested, 
patients will be screened to determine their eligibility for the study.  
Screening will be done in a closed room or private area at Wilmot 
Cancer Institute locations or in our Cancer Control Research 
Department. Recruitment and screening will be carried out at 
Wilmot Cancer Institute sites including, but not limited to, Wilmot 
Cancer Center, Wilmot Cancer Institute's Pluta Cancer Center, 
Wilmot Cancer Institute at Highland Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], Wilmot Cancer

West. During screening a patient must report cognitive difficulties of 
3 or higher (on a scale of 0 = “Not Present” to 10 = “As Bad As You 
Can Imagine”) adapted from a similar Symptom Inventory question, 
“Are you currently experiencing any cognitive (e.g. in memory, 
attention, concentration) problems since your cancer diagnosis?” 
If the patient then meets eligibility criteria, study personnel will 
explain the details of the study and obtain informed consent from 
patients who agree to participate. For subjects that are recruited 
and enrolled, study personnel will complete basic medical history 
questionnaires with the subjects, show them how to use the 
pedometer and how to correctly record their steps.  Study 
coordinator will verify at this time that the study subject is not 
pregnant from their medical record.  
Ideally, screening will occur by [INVESTIGATOR_2993]-person contact. Screening may 
also occur by [CONTACT_835260] a score of 3 or higher on a written form 
containing the screening question that has been provided to the 
patient (e.g. at appointment check-in given by [CONTACT_835261]/administrator or in person with study staff) at the start of 
or after their first chemotherapy treatment. Only patients that are to 
be receiving chemotherapy will be provided with this form. The 
coordinator will follow-up with interested participants to tell them 
about the study after physician or physician designee approval is 
granted for study personnel to approach the patient.  
5.[ADDRESS_1159821] 2 additional 
cycles of chemotherapy or 6 weeks of active chemotherapy 
treatment who meet the eligibility criteria including approval from 
their physician will be invited to participate in the trial.
Upon consent, with help from the study coordinator, the patient will 
complete an On-Study Data Form and a Medication Form to 
provide clinical and demographic data.  Questions concerning the 
patient’s medical history, supplement and prescription drug usage 
history, and exercise history are included.
The study coordinator will obtain information necessary to complete 
these forms from the patient’s medical records when the patient is 
unable to provide this information in sufficient detail (e.g., staging, 
Karnofsky Performance Scale or ECOG Performance Status, 
surgical procedures, types and doses of treatments).

5.3.3 Baseline measures of physical activity involve fitting each 
participant with a Pedometer for a 3-day baseline assessment prior 
to their next on-study chemotherapy. At baseline, patients will also 
complete brief and validated measures of cognitive functioning 
(FACT-COG), quality of life (FACT-G), sleep (PSQI), fatigue 
(FSCL), anxiety (STAI), mood (POMS), and depression (CESD). 
These forms will take approximately 15-20 minutes for the patients 
to complete.
Fasted blood samples (4-6 hours prior to blood draw with 
encouragement to maintain hydration) will be drawn by [CONTACT_194284]-
approved phlebotomists (URMC Labs) or by a Wilmot Cancer 
Institute phlebotomist or nurse. Blood samples may also be 
obtained at the Clinical Research Center (CRC) located in Strong 
Memorial Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_176629] a CRC phlebotomist or nurse. If the blood 
sample is not fasted, we will still collect the blood sample and note 
the last time the person ate in the research record. All subjects will 
be offered a light snack upon completion of the blood draw and 
provided with a $[ADDRESS_1159824] for a café at URMC.
In a cancer control designated laboratory (e.g. [CONTACT_142003]’s 
Physical Exercise, Activity and Kinesiology laboratory), patients will 
complete computerized and paper-based cognitive tests of 
memory, executive function and processing speed/attention that will 
total 60 minutes of time. 
Patients will then be evaluated on vitals (Resting Heart Rate, 
Height, Weight & Blood Pressure), aerobic capacity (VO2max 
Treadmill Test), muscular strength (Handgrip Dynamometry test 
and upper and lower body fitness testing), body composition 
(bioelectrical impedance) and physical activity.  All exercise testing 
will be conducted in the Physical Exercise, Activity, and Kinesiology 
(PEAK) Laboratory. The Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire 
(PAR-Q) will be used by [CONTACT_835262].   
 
5.3.4 Participants will be paid for participating in this study. Each 
participant will receive $40.00 upon completion of the baseline 
study visit assessments, $50.[ADDRESS_1159825]-
intervention visit assessments, and will be provided with a $[ADDRESS_1159826] for a café at URMC upon completion of each study blood 
draw. Participants will not be paid for visits that they do not 
complete. Participants can be paid up to $100.00 for taking part in

If participants will be traveling greater than [ADDRESS_1159827]-Intervention office visits at the PEAK 
Laboratory (located at [ADDRESS_1159828], [COMPANY_002]ster, NY 
[ZIP_CODE]), they will be provided with travel compensation. Distance 
based compensation will be provided as follows:  
Less than 25 miles round trip = $0
Between 25-50 miles round trip = $10
Greater than 50 miles round trip = $20 
Participants will be reimbursed for travel expenses up to a 
maximum amount of $40 during the study. Distance based 
compensation will not be provided if a participant’s research study 
visit corresponds with a clinic visit. Travel compensation and 
participant payment costs will be paid from funds from [CONTACT_835298]’ NCI K07 Award and her other research funds.  
Participants that are co-enrolled in RSRB [ZIP_CODE] and RSRB [ZIP_CODE] 
will receive compensation as scheduled for the Baseline study visit 
in RSRB [ZIP_CODE] in addition to the compensation scheduled for 
Assessment 5 in RSRB [ZIP_CODE].
5.3.2 Patients will be randomized to one of four treatment arms.  Study 
medication (provided by [CONTACT_835263] (IDS)) and instructions for ibuprofen/placebo 200 mg 
BID will be given and reviewed with all patients in a cancer control 
designated laboratory.  Study personnel will bring the medication to 
the cancer control laboratory at the time of randomization. Drug

may be delayed.
5.4.2 Fasting blood draws at 2 time-points (baseline and post-
intervention) will be done to measure cytokine, chemokine and 
receptor levels by [CONTACT_835265]/multiplex methods. These 
time-points coincide with baseline and post-intervention 
assessments but are not always on the same day. We often, at the 
request of the patient, will collect blood along with pre-
chemotherapy labs.
Blood draws will be performed by a nurse or phlebotomist in the 
Wilmot Cancer Institute and or by a nurse from the Clinical 
Research Center (CRC) at Strong Memorial Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_835237]’s chemotherapy appointment (within 5 days before or the 
morning/afternoon of). The time of day will be noted, with future 
assessments at approximately the same time of day during post-
testing.

in 2 red (for serum), 2 paxgene (for RNA), and 1 purple EDTA tube 
(for whole blood) vacutainers and will be transported by a member 
of the research team to [CONTACT_598936]’ Laboratory in the Department 
of Surgery for immediate spi[INVESTIGATOR_334], processing, and storing (at -20° 
or -80° C) of serum/whole blood/RNA. All human biological 
materials will be handled in adherence with the University of 
[COMPANY_002]ster Office of Environmental Safety Biosafety Level II 
requirements.  [CONTACT_275383]’s laboratory is a back-up site should that 
laboratory be needed for any processing. [CONTACT_275383]’s and [CONTACT_835298]’ laboratories have received appropriate biosafety 
certifications by [CONTACT_835266].  Samples not 
included in the immunological analyses of this project will be stored 
for future research by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Janelsins and her team (if the patient has 
consented that we can use their samples for future research).  
5.4.3 Blood Samples for Participants Co-enrolled in RSRB [ZIP_CODE]
For participants co-enrolled in RSRB [ZIP_CODE] and RSRB [ZIP_CODE], 
blood sample collection will occur once for Assessment 5 in RSRB 
[ZIP_CODE] and the Baseline visit in RSRB [ZIP_CODE]. After processing, 
blood samples will be split equally between the two studies. The 
total volume of blood collected from participants co-enrolled in 
RSRB [ZIP_CODE] and RSRB [ZIP_CODE] for both RSRB [ZIP_CODE] Assessment

times (i.e. during baseline, and at post-intervention). FACT-COG 
and FACT-G will be completed at pre- and post-intervention and at 
week 3 (during the intervention). Additionally, each patient will 
complete a daily diary which includes questions about symptoms, 
daily exercise, and drug usage. The exercise daily diary will also be 
used to measure adherence and compliance to the exercise 
intervention (if randomized to those arms). Participants assigned to 
the exercise program will wear the Garmin DAT and pedometer 
daily during the study intervention period. Participants assigned to 
non-exercise treatment arms will receive a Garmin DAT at the post-
intervention visit. 
5.4.5 All patients will be evaluated on aerobic capacity (VO2max 
Treadmill Test and Resting Metabolic Rate Test), and muscular 
strength (handgrip dynamometry).  All physiological fitness testing 
will be administered according to the Guidelines for Exercise 
Testing and Prescription (GETP) as outlined by [CONTACT_688391] (ACSM).  
5.4.6 All patients will be evaluated for cognitive performance on the 
CANTAB computerized neuropsychological assessment of memory 
performance on a delayed matching to sample task. This 
assessment measures memory across delay times (0, 4, 12 
seconds) as well as reaction time. This assessment is non-invasive 
and only requires touching a computer screen. This assessment 
takes less than 10 minutes to complete. Three other CANTAB tests 
will be included for secondary/exploratory analyses: Verbal 
Recognition Memory (Immediate and Delayed memory; ten 
minutes), Rapid Visual Information Processing (a short [ADDRESS_1159831] of attention and working memory) and One Touch Stockings of 
Cambridge (OTS) (a short ten-minute test of frontal lobe executive 
functioning).  Paper-based assessment with the WRAT, HVLT-R, 
COWA, and TMT A/B will also be conducted for secondary 
analyses.

Research subjects will be instructed to take the ibuprofen 
once in the morning and once in the evening as long as the 
doses are at least 8 hours apart.  Subjects will take 2 
capsules /day for duration of 6 weeks.   (Note: Study 
medication is prepared by [CONTACT_835268] 5.3.2).

assess any potential complications or toxicities due to the 
intervention.

5.6.2 The Home-Based Walking and Progressive Resistance Exercise 
Program, EXCAP, will follow the guidelines listed below.
[IP_ADDRESS] The Home-Based Walking Prescription will be based 
on a patient’s baseline pedometer assessment.  Subjects will 
be encouraged to increase their total steps walked by a 
minimum of 5% a week, while maintaining a moderate 
intensity, during the 6-week intervention.  [Note: Walking 
RSRB # [ZIP_CODE]                                        Page 22 of 46          Version Date: January 31, 2018intensity will be monitored via the Revised Rating of 
Perceived Exertion (RPE) Scale, which is a visual analog 
scale ranging from 0 = No exertion to 10 = Maximal exertion; 
and part of the daily diary that participants will keep.  An 
RPE between 3-7 corresponds to a heart rate reserve of 40-
70%] 
[IP_ADDRESS] The Home-Based Progressive Resistance 
Prescription will be based on a patient’s optimal level of 
challenge.  Subjects will be instructed on the proper use of 
resistance bands.  Subjects will then be instructed to choose 
a resistance band with which they can perform 8-15 
repetitions of various upper body resistance exercises (bicep 
curl, tricep extension, chest press, rows, overhead press)  
and lower body resistance exercises (leg curl, leg extension, 
squat, toe raises, side bends).  The resistance will be 
determined via the Revised Rating of Perceived Exertion 
(RPE) Scale.  Participants will choose a resistance level that 
corresponds to an RPE between 3-7.  Subjects will be 
instructed to begin with 1 set of 8-15 repetitions at a 
moderately challenging level daily.  Patients will be 
instructed to progressively increase to four (4) sets for each 
exercise daily with [ADDRESS_1159834] between 30 – 45 minutes.  (Note: Patients 
will be instructed in the proper methods for performing each 
exercise and will be able to call the coordinator or exercise 
trainer if questions arise).  The resistance band training 
program is a mild to moderate progressive resistance 
program designed to maintain strength, muscle mass and 
function, not a vigorous weight training program designed to 
substantially increase strength and muscle mass.  The dose 
of resistance exercise is very similar to programs used in 
rehabilitation.  It is common and safe to prescribe resistance 
exercises like these on a daily basis to maintain strength, 
muscle mass and function. 
[IP_ADDRESS] The study coordinator will talk with each patient 
on a weekly basis.  He/she will answer any questions 
the patient may have regarding the exercise program 
in order to facilitate proper adherence and compliance 
to the exercise intervention.  
5.6.3 All Walking and Progressive Resistance Exercises will be 
performed off-site from the University of [COMPANY_002]ster Cancer Institute 
RSRB # [ZIP_CODE]                                        Page 23 of 46          Version Date: January 31, 2018in a home-based patient-selected environment.  
5.6.4 There will be no costs to the patient for the physiological 
assessments (e.g. serum collection and muscular strength), 
resistance bands, pedometer, Garmin digital activity tracker, or 
Home-Based Walking and Progressive Resistance Exercise 
Prescription.  All costs will be paid from funds from [CONTACT_598936]’ 
NCI K07 Award and her other research funds.  
5.7 Toxicity Monitoring:
Removal from study:  Patients can be removed from the study for any of 
the following reasons:
1. Any grade ≥ 3 toxicity related to the study drug.
2. A grade 2 toxicity that persists for more than 2 weeks.
3. Withdrawal of consent.
For any clinically adverse event, the toxicity grading scale 
established by [CONTACT_681336].  It is as follows:
Grade 1 toxicity (Mild): No interference with activity
Grade 2 toxicity (Moderate): Some interference with activity not 
requiring medical intervention.
Grade 3 toxicity (Severe): Prevents daily activity and requires 
medical intervention.
Grade 4 toxicity (Potentially Life Threatening): ER visit or 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].
5.7.[ADDRESS_1159835]. Janelsins’ research team will be reviewed 
immediately by [CONTACT_835270] ([CONTACT_96600] (primary), 
[CONTACT_835299] (secondary), all other protocol oncologists (tertiary)) to 
determine whether the toxicity is related to the study interventions 
or to chemotherapy. If the toxicity is at least possibly due to the 
study interventions, the participant will be removed from the study. 
If a study participant is removed from the study, the research team 
may continue to follow the study participant for assessment data if 
the participant agrees and medical monitors feel it is safe for the 
participant to perform study assessments. 
5.7.2 Ibuprofen
The potential risks and side effects of ibuprofen include: 
RSRB # [ZIP_CODE]                                        Page 24 of 46          Version Date: January 31, 2018Side effects can include headaches, dizziness, drowsiness, rash, 
abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, constipation, and heartburn.  
Since ibuprofen reduces the ability of blood to clot, bleeding may be 
increased after injury. Studies of high doses of ibuprofen (800 mg 3 
times per day) have been associated with low incidence of 
gastroduodenal and gastric ulcers.[48, 49] The low dose for the 
proposed studies is not likely to cause ulcers; as a precaution, we 
are excluding those who have a history of ulcer disease during the 
past year. 
NSAIDs (e.g. ibuprofen) have been used in clinical studies in 
cancer patients receiving chemotherapy and have been safe and 
have not altered chemotherapy pharmacokinetics[50]. The doses of 
ibuprofen and time-frame of ibuprofen that we have chosen are 
similar to other ongoing studies of NSAIDs given in combination 
with chemotherapy (clinicaltrials.gov identifiers: [STUDY_ID_REMOVED], 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED], [STUDY_ID_REMOVED], [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). 
5.7.3  Exercise 
Commencement of a low to moderate walking and progressive 
resistance exercise program is not associated with any severe side 
effects, and risks are minimal for individuals with no 
cardiopulmonary, orthopedic, or age-identified high risk factors as 
determined by [CONTACT_102]’s treating physician (or designee).  
The chance of a cardiac event is rare once coronary disease has 
been excluded with reasonable certainty.  Approximately 1 death 
per 15,000-20,000 healthy men per year occurs during jogging; this 
risk is much lower in women.  A transient increase in blood 
pressure may occur with all types of exercise.  Although unlikely, 
the risks involved in a low to moderate walking and progressive 
resistance exercise program are musculoskeletal— possibly mild 
muscle soreness, a muscle strain, or related injuries such as 
trippi[INVESTIGATOR_007].  Overall, the risk level for participation in a low to moderate 
Home-Based Walking and Progressive Resistance program is 
minimal.  
Risks associated with a VO2max test or 6-minute walk test are 
similar to participation in a low to moderate walking exercise 
program and are minimal for individuals with no cardiopulmonary, 
orthopedic, or age-identified high risk factors as determined by [CONTACT_4677]’s doctor.    The nature of these assessments will require a 
level of exertion causing temporary changes such as an increase in 
heart rate and blood pressure, both of which are normal responses 
to moderate exercise.  Seven-to-ten Repetition Maximum Tests for 
RSRB # [ZIP_CODE]                                        Page 25 of 46          Version Date: January 31, 2018strength may cause minor stiffness and/or tenderness in muscles 
for a couple of days following testing.  The nature of these 
assessments will require a level of exertion causing temporary 
changes like an increase in heart rate and blood pressure, both of 
which are normal responses to moderate exercise.  There is a 
small risk of irritation to the skin from the electrodes used for the 
BIA analysis.  
Every effort will be made to minimize the risks for all study 
procedures through the approval of the treating physician to enter 
the study, supervision of all testing and exercise prescription by [CONTACT_835271] a physician (or physician’s designee) when necessary 
according to American College of Sports Medicine Guidelines, the 
use of standardized guidelines for exercise testing and prescription 
provided by [CONTACT_835272]. Risks will also be minimized by [CONTACT_835273]-funded and approved University of [COMPANY_002]ster 
Clinical Research Center, and trained staff will perform these tests. 
[CONTACT_142003] has found the intervention to be safe in breast and 
prostate cancer patients undergoing radiation treatment [45]; 
additional approved study with EXCAP in cancer patients receiving 
chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy is being conducted at the 
University and through the University of [COMPANY_002]ster NCORP 
program.  
5.7.[ADDRESS_1159836] any adverse events (AE) and/or 
serious adverse events (SAE).  All patients are routinely 
undergoing close supervision by [CONTACT_835274], these AEs and SAEs are addressed during the patients 
clinic visit as part of the standard of care. If any follow-up 
appointment is needed regarding the AE or SAE, the patient will 
follow-up as directed by [CONTACT_835275].  Reports regarding potential 
toxicities, patient safety, and outcomes will be submitted to the 
University of [COMPANY_002]ster Medical Center Research Subjects Review 
RSRB # [ZIP_CODE]                                        Page 26 of 46          Version Date: January 31, 2018Board (RSRB).
[IP_ADDRESS] An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical 
occurrence in a patient administered a pharmaceutical 
product, which does not necessarily have a causal 
relationship with the treatment.  An adverse event can be 
any unfavorable and unintended sign (eg, including an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease 
temporally associated with the use of the drug, whether or 
not it is considered to be drug related.  This includes any 
newly occurring event or previous condition that has 
increased in severity or frequency since the administration of 
drug.
5.8.1.2A serious adverse event (SAE) is any adverse event, 
occurring at any dose and regardless of causality that:
Results in death.
Is life-threatening.  Life-threatening means that the patient 
was at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it 
occurred, i.e., it does not include a reaction which 
hypothetically might have caused death had it occurred in a 
more severe form.
Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4967].  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2144]/or 
surgical operations scheduled to occur during the study 
period but planned prior to study entry are not considered 
AEs if the illness or disease existed before the patient was 
enrolled in the trial, provided that it did not deteriorate in an 
unexpected manner during the trial (eg, surgery performed 
earlier than planned).
Results in persistent or significant 
disability/incapacity.  Disability is defined as a substantial 
disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life 
functions.
Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.
Is an important medical event.  An important medical event 
is an event that may not result in death, be life-threatening, 
or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_15977], based upon appropriate medical judgment, it may 
jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in 
the definitions for SAEs.  Examples of such medical events 
include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment 
in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or 
convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or 
the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.

experience, the specificity or severity of which is not 
consistent with the risk information described in the 
investigators brochure or general investigational plan. 
Unexpected as used in this definition refers to an adverse 
drug event that has not been previously observed rather 
than from the perspective of such experience not having 
been anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the 
drug/intervention.
5.8.[ADDRESS_1159837] continuous review of data and patient 
safety.  The review will include for each treatment arm level:  the 
number of patients, significant toxicities as described in the 
protocol, dose adjustments, and responses observed.  The 
Investigator will submit twice yearly summaries of this data to the 
Clinical Trials Monitoring Committee for review.

Safety Coordinator:  The Medical Director of the Cancer Center 
Clinical Trials Office appoints the Safety Coordinator.  The Safety 
Coordinator monitors adverse event rates utilizing the URCC 
Clinical Trials database.  If any assigned study has had two or more 
of the same SAEs reported in a month or more than six of the same 
SAEs in six months, the DSMC will review the summary of SAEs, 
discuss events with the Study Chair, and conduct a more detailed 
review with the Study Chair.  The Data Safety Monitoring Chair will 
determine if further action is required.
5.8.4 All study drugs will be dispensed and all biological specimens will 
be collected at the University of [COMPANY_002]ster Medical Center 
locations.
6.0  Treatment Evaluation
6.1 Measures
6.1.1 Cognitive Assessments – Computerized (~35 minutes)
[IP_ADDRESS] CANTAB was developed for assessment and 
evaluation of cognitive function. CANTAB tests are reliable and 
validated and have been reported in over [ADDRESS_1159838]. Deborah 
RSRB # [ZIP_CODE]                                        Page 29 of 46          Version Date: January 31, 2018Cory-Slechta. 
The administrator will closely follow the provided script. The primary 
outcome measure will be short-term memory (percent correct) 
performance across a delay series as assessed by [CONTACT_835278]. This test takes approximately 10 minutes 
to complete, and a total of three data points is obtained (at 0, 4, and 
12 seconds). A subject is shown a complex visual pattern and then, 
after a brief delay (4 and 12 seconds), is shown four similar 
patterns. The subject is instructed to touch the pattern on the 
computer screen which exactly matches the sample. Speed to 
complete the task (latency in ms) is also assessed within the same 
measure which may indicate attention/motivation contributions to 
performance on the task. 
6.1.1.2Memory (verbal) will also be assessed by [CONTACT_835279] (VRM) Task. In this task, the subject is asked 
to remember a list of words (presented to them on a screen) and 
then immediately recall them verbally. The subject is then asked to 
recall from a list if they previously saw the word (pressing yes or 
no). Following the next two tasks (i.e. the executive function and 
attention task) approximately [ADDRESS_1159839] (pressing 
yes or no) from the original list of words.    
[IP_ADDRESS]  Attention will be assessed by [CONTACT_835280] (RVP) task. The second secondary 
outcome measure will be total latency (ms). Errors will also be 
recorded. A white box is displayed in the center of the computer 
screen, inside which digits, from [ADDRESS_1159840] consecutive odd or even sequences of digits (for example, 2-
4-6) and respond by [CONTACT_835281].  
[IP_ADDRESS] Executive function will be assessed by [CONTACT_835282] (OTS) planning task (total percent 
correct). Percent correct based on the number of necessary moves 
involved will also be assessed. The subject is shown two displays 
containing three colored balls. The displays are presented in such a 
way that they can easily be perceived as stacks of colored balls 
held in stockings or socks suspended from a beam. There is a row 
of boxes containing numbers at the bottom of the screen, from one 
upwards. The test administrator first demonstrates to the subject 
how to use the balls in the lower display to copy the pattern shown 
in the upper display. The balls may be moved one at a time by 
[CONTACT_835283], then touching the position to which it 
RSRB # [ZIP_CODE]                                        Page 30 of 46          Version Date: January 31, 2018should be moved. The subject is shown one demonstration 
problem, then must solve three further problems. These problems 
increase in complexity, from one move to four moves. Next the 
subject is shown more problems and must work out how many 
moves the solutions require in his/her head, then touch the 
appropriate box at the bottom of the screen to indicate the number 
of moves required.  
[IP_ADDRESS] All patients will complete the 50-item Functional 
Assessment of Cancer Therapy with Cognition (FACT-Cog) 
questionnaire.  The FACT-Cog addresses a wide range of cognitive 
functioning domains which allows one to separate specific domains 
of cognition. It was developed by [CONTACT_431540][6] and is 
currently undergoing validation in studies with cancer patients.[51] 
6.1.2   Cognitive Assessment – Paper Based (~25 minutes)
[IP_ADDRESS] Basic academic skills/cognitive reserve will be 
measured with the Wide Range Achievement Test-Third Edition 
(WRAT-4). This test has been validated for individuals aged 5-
75.[49] Three subtests are included: reading, spelling, and 
arithmetic. The reading test includes the recognition and naming of 
letters and pronunciation of words out of context. The spelling test 
includes the subject writing his/her name [CONTACT_835297]. The arithmetic involves counting, reading 
number symbols, solving oral problems, and doing written 
computations. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Short-term memory will be assessed by [CONTACT_835284]-Revised (HVLT-
R).[50, 51] In this test, the administrator reads a list of [ADDRESS_1159841] words in both the 
immediate (3 trials) and delayed recall (after 20 min).  For the 
delayed recall, the number of correct words minus the number of 
incorrect words will also be recorded. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Attention/scanning, speed/sequencing, and 
executive function will be assessed by [CONTACT_246647] 
(Comprehensive Trail Making Test Trails 1 and 5).[52, 53] In part 
A/Trail 1, participants draw a line connected to each number in 
sequential order. In part B/Trail 5, participants draw a line to 
connect numbers and letters in sequential order. Time to complete 
RSRB # [ZIP_CODE]                                        Page 31 of 46          Version Date: January 31, 2018the test (in seconds) is recorded for both parts A and B.  Part A is 
stopped after 3 min, and Part B is stopped after 5 minutes.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Verbal fluency/executive function will be assessed 
by [CONTACT_835285] (COWA).[54] 
Designed by [CONTACT_835286], this test assesses fluency with 
naming words with C, F, and L.  Subjects are asked to tell the 
administrator as many words as possible beginning with the letter 
C, excluding proper nouns, numbers, and the same word with a 
different suffix. The subject has [ADDRESS_1159842] takes less than five 
minutes to administer. Trials are repeated for the letter F and L. 
6.1.3 Inflammation markers 
Cytokines and their receptors (e.g. IL-1, TNF-α, IL-6), 
Chemokines (e.g. MCP-1 and IL-8) prostaglandins (i.e. PGE2) can 
be easily measured in the serum with reliable results. Serum is 
aliquoted into microfuge tubes to minimize freeze/thaw cycles that 
could result in protein degradation. Cytokine levels will be assessed 
using a colorimetric ELISAs from R & D Systems in [CONTACT_598936]’ 
Laboratory or by [CONTACT_835287]. Inflammation marker RNA levels and genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_835242]-PCR at the URMC Genomics Core.

as a measure of compliance using a modified “Branching Treadmill 
Protocol”. Participants begin at a normal walking speed (2.5 mph) 
and 0% grade. After 2 min. the speed is increased to a faster 
walking speed (3.0 mph) and 0% grade. After 2 min, the speed is 
increased to 3.5 mph and 2% grade. Thereafter, only the grade is 
increased by 2% every 2 min. Oxygen consumption (VO2), carbon 
dioxide production (VCO2), and flow rate will be measured 
continuously. The test is ended when the participant wants to stop. 
An MD is available onsite in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_835243].  In preparation for the 
exercise treadmill test, subjects have the option to fast for [ADDRESS_1159845] calorimetry (Sensormedics® 
Vmax).  A 6-Minute walking test may be substituted for the treadmill 
test in the event the person is not able to complete it.  This is a sub 
maximal measurement using a [ADDRESS_1159846], the total distance 
walked is used to calculate an estimate of aerobic capacity 
(VO2max:Maximal Oxygen Consumption).
6.1.[ADDRESS_1159847] is administered with the patient standing in 
anatomical position; the elbow joint angle will be held constant at 
180 degrees with the medial distal humeral epi[INVESTIGATOR_681323] 2 inches 
from the torso.  Trials will be performed in an alternating bilateral 
sequence for a total of six attempts (three with each arm).  The best 
score of the three trials will be used for right and left limbs to 
calculate static strength.  The surgically involved arm(s) will be 
RSRB # [ZIP_CODE]                                        Page 33 of 46          Version Date: January 31, 2018noted for data analysis.  The handgrip dynamometer test has been 
previously used in a number of URCC NCORP protocols and has 
shown to be a reliable clinical method of assessing strength. [52] 
The standard 7-10 Repetition Maximum Dynamic Strength 
Testing Protocol will be used to estimate patients’ 1-repetition 
maximums for the leg extension (quadriceps) and bench press 
(pectoralis and deltoid). The patients will receive a full orientation 
to the fixed resistance machines and proper lifting form by a 
certified (e.g., ACSM) exercise testing professional.  Participants 
will perform a light warm up consisting of [ADDRESS_1159848] breaks (2-3 minutes) and lifting 
bouts will continue with the resistance weight being adjusted by [CONTACT_835288] a level of resistance 
that results in subjective fatigue between 7-10 repetitions.   
Established algorithms employing the weight lifted and the number 
of repetitions completed will then be used to estimate the patients’ 
1-repetition maximum.[53] 
6.1.7 Muscle Mass
The RJL Bioelectrical Impedance System is a non-invasive, 
easy-to administer and safe method of assessing lean body mass.  
BIA involves passing a small electrical current through the body 
and evaluating the reactance and resistance to flow, which are 
related to fat-free mass (FFM) and total body water.  Prediction of 
lean body mass from BIA is as reliable as skin-fold measurements 
and hydrostatic weighing.  Participants have the option to be 4 
hours fasted, although it is not required. Participants need to be 
abstained from alcohol and diuretics (unless prescribed) for 48 
hours, well hydrated (water only), and voided completely prior to 
assessment.  We will also document whether participants exercised 
within the last [ADDRESS_1159849], to ensure a 
resting metabolic state.  Electrodes are attached to the right hand 
(distal end of the 3rd and 4th metacarpal and distal end of the ulnar 
and radius), and the right foot (distal end of the 3rd and 4th 
metatarsal and distal end of the tibia and fibula).  Skeletal muscle 
mass will then be calculated from the lean body mass. [54] 
6.1.8 Daily Diaries 
RSRB # [ZIP_CODE]                                        Page 34 of 46          Version Date: January 31, 2018Participants will be asked to complete daily diaries each night. All 
participants will complete the Daily Symptom Diary. Participants 
assigned to the exercise intervention will be asked to record step 
counts measured via pedometer and Garmin digital activity tracker, 
number of minutes they exercised that day (aerobic and resistance 
training), perceived exertion during exercise, and severity of eight 
symptoms assessed on 11-point scales anchored by 0 = “Not 
Present” and 10 = “As Bad As You Can Imagine” on the Exercise 
Daily Diary. The symptoms queried about at their worst on a daily 
basis are fatigue, sleep, stress, depression, concentration, memory, 
pain and anxiety. The diary takes 2-3 minutes to complete. 
Questions about daily exercise and daily NSAID usage are also 
included. Note: When patient diaries are returned to us they the 
symptom section will be reviewed for indications of problems and 
the patient’s medical team will be notified if any symptom is 
consistently scored as [ADDRESS_1159850]’s medical team if a severe 
complaint (scored as 8 or greater and out of the ordinary for the 
patient) is made. 
6.1.9 Quality of Life
The Functional Assessment of Cancer Treatment-General (FACT-
G) is a 27-item assessment of four domains of well-being: 
physical, social/family, emotional, and functional. Subjects are 
asked questions related to domains of well-being on a five point 
scale (0-4) with 0 being a score of “not at all” and 4 being a score of 
“very much”. This questionnaire is a well-validated test for 
assessment of quality of life for cancer patients receiving 
treatment.[55, 56]
       6.1.11 Mood
General mood will be assessed using the short form of the Profile 
of Mood States (POMS).  The POMS consists of 30 adjectives in 6 
subscales (e.g., anxiety, depression), which subjects rate on a five-
point scale with “1” = “Not at all” and”5” = “Extremely” to describe 
their moods over the past week.  The POMS has been used 
extensively in research with cancer patients and has demonstrated 
reliability and validity. [57, 58]
6.1.[ADDRESS_1159851] (FSCL)[59] will be administered to 
measure fatigue. This instrument consists of 30 items in three 
RSRB # [ZIP_CODE]                                        Page 35 of 46          Version Date: January 31, 2018subscales that have been associated with fatigue: drowsiness and 
dullness, difficulty of concentration, and projection of physical 
impairment. Subjects are asked to indicate the presence and 
intensity of each item on a five-point scale. Both the number and 
intensity of fatigue symptoms can be calculated for this scale. 
6.1.13 Anxiety 
Anxiety will be measured using the Spi[INVESTIGATOR_73593]/Trait 
Anxiety Inventory (STAI Form X-1).  In order to reduce the overall 
patient burden, we will use only the state portion of the 
questionnaire.  This one-page, self-administered questionnaire 
consists of [ADDRESS_1159852] to 
indicate the degree to which they generally experience the 
particular feeling, ranging from 1 = “Not at all” to 4 = “Very much so” 
at that time.  It is one of the most widely-used assessments of 
anxiety.  Internal consistency coefficients > 0.[ADDRESS_1159853]/retest reliability coefficients > 0.70.  Concurrent, 
construct, convergent and divergent validity have also been 
demonstrated. [63]  We have successfully implemented this measure 
in previous studies.
6.1.14 Sleep 
The Pi[INVESTIGATOR_243999] (PSQI), a commonly
used, 25 item psychometrically sound measure scored for both
global severity and subscale scores, will assess sleep initiation and
maintenance problems and possible etiologic factors (e.g., pain,
nightmares, hot flashes).[64]  This measure has been implemented
in other NCORP studies conducted by [CONTACT_27156].  
6.1.15 Depression 
Depressive symptoms will be measured with the Center for 
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_67905] (CES-D).  The CES-
D is a 20-item depression scale developed and validated for use 
with a variety of populations.  It is in a format similar to that of the 
Beck Depression Inventory, but with less emphasis on physical 
symptoms of depression that may be confounded with disease 
symptoms or treatment side effects.  It has been shown to reliably 
and validly measure depression in cancer populations,[65] and we 
have successfully used this measure in previous studies.  
Note: Because cognitive difficulties, depression, anxiety, mood 
disruption, sleep disturbance and fatigue are often present as 
RSRB # [ZIP_CODE]                                        Page 36 of 46          Version Date: January 31, 2018symptom clusters, measures of depression, anxiety, mood, sleep 
and fatigue have been carefully selected to minimize potential 
confounding and enable assessment of possible confounds 
between these concepts.  
6.1.[ADDRESS_1159854]. If requested, A Summary of 
Physical Activity Testing sheet will be completed by [CONTACT_835289]. The sheet will contain results 
of the patient vitals (pulse, blood pressure, height, weight), body 
composition, and metabolic, strength, and cardiopulmonary 
assessment results. The study coordinator or exercise physiologist 
will discuss the results provided on the Summary of Physical 
Activity Testing sheet over a follow-up phone call with the subject or 
in person in the PEAK lab.
7.0  Statistical Considerations
7.1 Primary analyses: The primary purpose for conducting this Phase II 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_835244] a larger R01-level investigator-initiated grant submission of 
efficacy. The primary analyses will consist of calculating means, 
standard deviations and effect sizes for each of the objectives at 
pre-intervention and post-intervention in each of the [ADDRESS_1159855] 
size estimates for an R01 submission. The main analyses are 
described individually below for each of the study hypotheses. 
Stratification: All models will have gender and site as additional 
covariates. 
7.1.1 Hypothesis 1 (Primary Objective): Exercise and ibuprofen 
(combined or alone) will lead to higher short-term memory 
performances (percent correct across delays) as assessed by [CONTACT_835290]. The mean effect of 
RSRB # [ZIP_CODE]                                        Page 37 of 46          Version Date: January 31, 2018treatment arm scores will be assessed by [CONTACT_835291], using the 
longest delay on this task (1200 ms), with baseline as a covariate. 
Interaction terms may be included but removed if not significant. 
We will also assess other covariates that may influence cognitive 
function, including age, education level, menopausal status (if 
applicable), and WRAT-4 reading score. Additionally, repeated 
measures ANOVAs using mixed modeling across sessions (0,4,12 
second delays) will be used. To model the response (Post-
intervention – Baseline), the fixed effects will be delay, arm, and 
delay x arm interaction. Random effects will be patient to patient 
and within patient variability. All main effects will be studied by [CONTACT_447]-
hoc tests. In all cases, p values of ≤ 0.05 will be considered 
statistically significant.  
7.1.2 Hypothesis 2 (Secondary Objective): At post-intervention, the 
effects of exercise and ibuprofen (combined or alone) on quality of 
life as assessed by [CONTACT_92349]-COG self-reported cognitive 
performance after completion of all chemotherapy compared to the 
control. The mean effects of treatment arm scores will be assessed 
by [CONTACT_835292] a covariate. Interaction 
terms will be incorporated initially but removed if not significant. We 
will also assess other covariates that may influence cognitive 
function, including age, education level, menopausal status (if 
applicable), and WRAT-4 reading score.
7.1.3 Hypothesis 3 (Tertiary Objective): At post-intervention assessment, 
exercise and ibuprofen (combined or alone) will lead to reduced 
immune marker levels compared to standard care in cancer 
patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy. The mean effects of 
treatment arm scores will be assessed by [CONTACT_835293] a covariate. Interaction term between baseline and arm 
will be included initially, but removed from the model if not 
significant. We will also assess other covariates that may influence 
cognitive function, including age, education level, menopausal 
status (if applicable), and WRAT-4 reading score.
7.1.4 Exploratory Hypotheses: Additional analyses will examine between 
group differences in the other outcome measures.  These will 
include performance on CANTAB attention and executive 
functioning tests, paper-based tests of attention, reading, executive 
function and verbal memory, Physical Activity (Pedometer), aerobic 
capacity (VO2max treadmill test, Resting metabolic Rate), muscular 
strength (handgrip dynamometry and 7-10 Rep. Max Tests), body 
mass (BIA), other disease or cognitively related biomarkers, and 
self-reported measures (i.e. cognitive functioning, quality of life, 
fatigue, anxiety, depression, sleep, mood). These exploratory 
RSRB # [ZIP_CODE]                                        Page 38 of 46          Version Date: January 31, 2018analyses may be useful in refining or adding to the follow-up larger 
study. Preliminary analyses of the relationships to these outcomes 
and biomarkers will be conducted.

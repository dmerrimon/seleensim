 Clinical Protocol Synopsis  
 
1. Title  
Optimizing a self-directed mobile copi[INVESTIGATOR_104272]’ psychological distress (aka: Blueprint).  
 
2. Background   
As survival has improved for the [ADDRESS_115696]-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).  However, few targeted interventions exist that are relevant to  patients' experiences and that accommodate their many 
physical, and social barriers to personalized care. To fill this gap, we have developed an innovative, native 
mobile copi[INVESTIGATOR_25125] (CST) program that promotes automated care delivery and self-management 
of symptom-related distress. CST, by [CONTACT_104330]-efficacy and adaptive copi[INVESTIGATOR_007], reduces psychological 
distress symptoms, thereby [CONTACT_104331].  
Previous trials, in which this pi[INVESTIGATOR_104273] (RCT) is based, have demonstrated that adaptive 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_25125] (CST), is an active response for managing stressful events such as the experience of a critical illness. Cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_104274] s have emphasized in their own words the importance of 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_104275]. While the use of adaptive copi[INVESTIGATOR_25110] (e.g., relaxation, positive reframing, problem solving) is associated with decreased psychological distre ss, survivors infrequently 
apply such strategies. 
 Therefore, we propose a 2-year project that will pi[INVESTIGATOR_48085] t CST via a native mobile app known as “Blueprint” in 
which [ADDRESS_115697] in which 60 eligible patients will be randomized to 
1 of 3 arms in a 3:3:2 manner (i.e., n=25: n=25: n=10). The pi[INVESTIGATOR_104276] a future definitive RCT designed to test a longer-term, self-directed mobile app version of CST. The pi[INVESTIGATOR_104277] (CSTEP and LIFT RCTs). Both trials previously conducted raised questions about the ideal balance between the uses of a CST therapi[INVESTIGATOR_104278]. At t he conclusion of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], we hope to have 
addressed the key questions raised in previous work and use the learned information to inform the conduct 
of a next-step multi-center RCT.  
3. Study Design 
As mentioned in section 2, this project consists of tw o distinct aims: aim 1 (usability) and aim 2 (RCT). Aim 
[ADDRESS_115698] will be conducted within a population of 5 to 15 healthy volunteers using a single study visit 
lasting approximately 30 to 60 minutes in which they will be asked to provide feedback on the app and it’s 
contents. Individuals enrolled into this aim will be asked to provide feedback via written communication. Feedback will be used to improve the app for Aim 2 (RCT).  Aim 2, which is the main focus of this exploratory pi[INVESTIGATOR_83021] (RCT) is to be conducted 
within a population of 60 cardio-respi[INVESTIGATOR_104279] a 3-month follow-up. Eligible patients will be 
those individuals who are admitted to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_104280]. Additional characteristics of the target population are those that exhibit high psychological distress, as 
defined by [CONTACT_104332][INVESTIGATOR_104281] (HADS) and Post Traumatic Stress Scale (PTSS) surv eys. Eligible patients will be identified via daily 
electronic medical record (EMR) review and approached for consent while still hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057]. Patients will be 
  
 
 
Protocol version: 1.1  Dated: [ADDRESS_115699]-consent, but at the time of 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], if possible. Upon discharge, patients will be asked to complete survey 1, T1, to assess their 
levels of psychological distress. Should the patient demonstrate high enough levels of psychological distress, they will be randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms:  
 Arm 1: mCST Intervention Group 1 (self-directed copi[INVESTIGATOR_104282]) 
 Arm 2: mCST Intervention Group 2 (self-directed copi[INVESTIGATOR_104283]) 
 Arm 3: usual care (control group; no CST therapi[INVESTIGATOR_104284]) 
 Each participant, regardless of randomization arm will be asked to complete the following surveys at the listed time points below: 
 Baseline (during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], post consent) 
o Collect sociodemographic data and establish baseline psychological distress.  
 T1 (at the time of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345], within 1 week of returning to home but no more than 1 month 
(30 days) from discharge) 
o Complete the HADS, PTSS, and PHQ-10, QOL 100-point visual analog scale, IADL/ADLs 
 T2 (1 month (30 days) post date of discharge; up to 2 months (60 days) for completion) 
o Complete the HADS, PTSS, and PHQ-10, QOL 100-point visual analog scale, IADL/ADLs 
 T3 (3 months (90 days) post date of discharge; up to 4 months (120 days) for completion)  
o Complete the HADS, PTSS, and PHQ-10, QOL 100-point visual analog scale, IADL/ADLs, 
CSQ-[ADDRESS_115700] month (30 days) of study parti cipation, post discharge. The purpose of this survey is 
to assess overall psychological distress.  
 
For those patients who are assigned to arms 1 or 2, the will be asked to utilize the app for 1 month (28 days). During that 1 month time period, they will be pr ovided with weekly copi[INVESTIGATOR_25110], as listed below:  
 Week 1: Progressive Muscle Relaxation and Pleasant Imagery 
o Week 1 includes two copi[INVESTIGATOR_25110]: progressive muscle relaxation and pleasant imagery. 
Progressive muscle relaxation is the practice of taking time to enjoy the feeling  of relaxation, 
whereas the practice of pleasant imagery is using one’s imagination to create a pleasant or happy see, like a pleasant daydream, that they can return to at any moment.   
 Week 2: Pleasant Activities and activity-Rest Cycling 
o Week 2, like week 1, includes two copi[INVESTIGATOR_25110] : pleasant activities and activity rest cycling. 
Pleasant activities is intended to help one plan to do regular activities by 1) convincing one’s 
self to find time and effort to complete the ac tivity/ies they enjoy, 2) develop a schedule to 
help them commit to completing the activity/ies, and 3) encourage one to hold themselves and have others help hold them accountable to comple te the activity/ies. Activity rest cycling 
is a practice in which one learns to overcome “over activity”, meaning doing too much at one 
time or over doing a particular activity. There are [ADDRESS_115701] 
cycling: 1) identify activities that one may over-do, 2) take note of how one feels after the activity is completed, and 3) set time limitations on how long one will perform the activity.  
 Week 3: Fast Relax and Managing Negative Thoughts 
o Week 3 includes two copi[INVESTIGATOR_25110]: Fast relax and managing negative thoughts. The purpose 
of fast relax is to help one keep feelings, such as pain or tension levels, low throughout the day by [CONTACT_104333]’s self to be still and breath fully for a few seconds to a minute. 
Managing negative thoughts encourages individuals to understand that having negative 
thoughts is okay and normal; the practice encourages one to notice their negative thoughts, 
  
 
 
Protocol version: 1.1  Dated: 22 July 2020 Page 8 of 116 
 such as worry, anger, stress, and then teaches them to take control of the thought(s) and 
then change the thought to be more positive.  
 Week 4: Problem Solving and Maintenance 
o Week 4 includes one additional copi[INVESTIGATOR_104285]: problem solving. Problem solving is a skill that 
helps an individual focus on one problem at a time and teaches them to 1) recognize what the problem is, 2) understand why there is a problem, and 3) help them think about what they can do to solve the problem. Additionally, during week 4, individuals are instructed on how to maintain the copi[INVESTIGATOR_104286] 3 weeks and are encouraged to practice the skill(s) that worked best for them.  
 
At the beginning of each week, a brief introduction video explaining the study will be provided. During each week’s exercise, patients will have the opportunity to lis ten to pre-recorded visual audios of physicians and 
patients describing their own, personal copi[INVESTIGATOR_104287]’s skill.   
The native app will track fidelity and adherence by [CONTACT_104334] (i.e., study team) to track individual patient use. Should a patient stop responding to the app (e.g., stop using it for any period of time), the study team may contact [CONTACT_104335]/her of their commitment to the study and the importance of compliance.   
For those individuals in arm 3, they will receive neit her therapi[INVESTIGATOR_104288]-directed intervention. The study 
team will administer the weekly surveys during the fi rst month (30 days) via email and/or phone, and at T1, 
T2, and T3.   The study will be conducted at Duke  University Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (DUH) and Durham Regional Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (DRH). 
 
4. Study Objectives,  Hypotheses,  and Outcomes  
The overall objective of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_104289], acceptability and clinical impact of the 
intervention on patients’ 1- and 3-month psychological di stress symptoms of a self-directed mobile copi[INVESTIGATOR_603] (mCST) intervention, known as “B lueprint” as compared to usual care control.  
 
The primary hypothesis in which this study is based is  that the mCST will be feasible and acceptable based 
on comparison of observed to priori benchmarks.  The second hypothesis is compared to usual care, the mCST use by [CONTACT_104336] 1- and 3-month mark post randomization.  
 
The primary outcome of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_104290]. The Client Satisfaction Questionnaire 8 will measure acceptability with open-ended participant feedback completed at the time of T3, which is considered end of study (EOS). Feasib ility will be measured by [CONTACT_104337], 
retention, and adherence. Secondary outcomes are HADS and PTSS scores at [ADDRESS_115702] been admitted to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_104291] (i.e., conditions that typi[INVESTIGATOR_104292], acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_104293] [ARDS], influenza, trauma, and post-op 
complications) or cardiac failure or insufficiency (i.e., conditions that require advanced cardiac support such 
  
 
 
Protocol version: 1.1  Dated: 22 July 2020 Page 9 of 116 
 as septic shock, myocardial infarction, cardiogenic shock, and congestive heart failure). Additionally, given 
the world-wide pandemic of 2020, patients who experience a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_104294]-19 and 
require respi[INVESTIGATOR_69908]/or cardiac support will also be enrolled.

1. Failure to randomize within 1 month after discharge from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_21104].  
2. Failure to access app within 1 month after randomization.  
  
7. Study Procedures    
Screening,  Recruitment  and Consent 
Screening for eligible patients will occur daily vi a MaestroCare by [CONTACT_104339] 2 (RCT). For Aim 1 (usability), the study team will recruit healthy volunteers from the Pulmonary Medicine Healthy Volunteer Data Repos itory (Pro00102890). The study team will maintain a 
robust screening log of all individuals reviewed and will document whether or not each individual was 
eligible for the study. Additionally, they will document if each individual was approached for consent and 
the outcome of consent. It will be essential, for the future RCT that it is understood why inidivuals are or are not eligible for approach and/or subsequent consent, therefore the screening log will track reason for ineligibility and reason for non-consent.   
For those individuals who are eligible to consent, the study team will recruit the individual in-person or 
remotely using an approved telephone script. Patients for the RCT will be approached, ideally at the time of their hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063], just prior to their discharge to an in home setting, if possible. Should the study team be unable to make contact [CONTACT_104340][INVESTIGATOR_059], the study team will contact [CONTACT_104341]. However, patients can be approached earlier in their admission, if well enough, or within a week of returning to their home for participation in the study. All patients will be 
informed at the time of recruitment that research is voluntary and they do not have to participate if they 
do not want to. Furthermore, they will be informed that participation will not affect their care in any way. If a patient chooses to not participate, he/she will be documented as a ‘declined’ patient and the date of decline, as well as reason for decline (if available) will be documented. Should a patient be approached while in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_104298], they will be asked to complete the app registration and 
baseline survey, and then a study team member will contact [CONTACT_476], once home, to remind them to login 
to the app to complete T1 for randomization. Should a patient be approached post-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345], he/she will be asked to complete app registration, baseline survey and T1 on the same day for study enrollment and randomization purposes. As with screening,  the study team will be required to maintain 
a robust enrollment log that documents the patient’s consent status, version of informed consent with reference date of IRB approval, and then ultimate study status with associated visit milestones.  
 
It is important to note that for this study, there are several statuses an individual can have. They are listed below:  
 Screened (in screening or screened): defined as any individual whose EMR (aim 2 only) or 
REDCap CRF (aim 1 only) has been reviewed against protocol for eligibility purposes. Individuals who are assigned this status must be noted on the screening log.  
 Consented : defined as any individual who is approached for consent and voluntarily chooses to 
consent to the study, the procedures, risks and benefits with the understanding that they may withdraw at any time. A signed/dated informed consent must be on record to account for this 
individual. Patients, enrolled in the aim 2, who reach this status will be required to complete T1 
at the time of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_104299] [ADDRESS_115703] be noted on the enrollment log. 
  
 
 
Protocol version: 1.1  Dated: 22 July 2020 Page 11 of 116 
  Declined : defined as any individual who was approached for consent, but opted to NOT 
consent and therefore to NOT participate in the study. Individuals who are assigned this status must be noted on the screening log. 
 Randomized (aim 2 only) : defined as any patient who was consented to the study, is 
discharged from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_21104], completes T1 survey, and continues to meet all eligibility 
criteria (see Eligibility Criteria, section 5). Patients who reach this status will be required to 
interact with the app on a daily basis for [ADDRESS_115704] be maintained on the enrollment log.  
 Screen Failed (aim 2 only):  defined as any patient who was consented to the study, is 
discharged from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_21104], and complete s T1 survey, and DOES NOT meet all eligibility 
criteria (see Eligibility Criteria, section 5). Patients who reach this status have no additional follow-ups or study requirements. Patients who are assigned this status must be maintained on 
the enrollment log. 
 Withdraw by [CONTACT_976] [INVESTIGATOR_104300]:  defined as any individual who voluntarily consents to participate in the 
study, but is then withdrawn from the study. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_21552] a participate at any time without their consent if the PI [INVESTIGATOR_104301]. Additionally, if the patient is re-admitted to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_104302], he/she will be withdrawn from the study by [CONTACT_978]. The study  team may re-enroll the patient at the time 
of discharge following the same screening procedures. The patient may withdraw themselves at 
any time; the study team will be asked to document  the reason for withdraw for study records. 
Patients who reach this status have no additional follow-ups or study requirements. Patients who are assigned this status must be maintained on the enrollment log. 
 Lost to Follow-Up (LTF):  defined as any individual who voluntarily consents to participate in 
the study but after non-compliance and at least 3 documented, attempted contacts appropriately spaced 1-5 days apart, the individual will be considered LTF.  
o For aim 2 only:  
 Patients who reach this status have no additional follow-ups or study 
requirements. Patients who are assigned this status must be maintained on the enrollment log. 
 A patient who returns the study team’s contacts within [ADDRESS_115705] may resume study participation.  
 Completed:  defined as any individual who both consented and randomized to the study and 
completed T1-T3 (aim 2 only) or any individual who completed assigned study visit (aim 1 only). 
Individuals who reach this status have no additional follow-up or study requirements. Individuals 
who are assigned this status must be maintained on the enrollment log. 
 
Study Visits 
 
For aim 1, each participant will be asked to complete a singular study visit that last approximately 30-[ADDRESS_115706] consent, the individual will be asked to do the following: 
 Find and install the Pattern Health app 
 Register to the Blueprint study 
 Complete baseline survey 
 Randomize to 1 of 3 arms or screen fail purposely  
 Provide feedback on app content and usability.  
 For aim 2, each consented patient will be asked to complete up to four individual study visits. 
  
 
 
Protocol version: 1.1  Dated: 22 July 2020 Page 12 of 116 
  Baseline:  this visit is to occur post-consent (same day, ideally) at the time of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_104303]. However, this visit may occur at the time of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_104299] 1-3 days of returning to home. At this visit, the following will occur: 
o App Registration 
o Baseline Survey Completion 
 T1 (Day 0) (+30 days):  this visit is to occur at the time of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_104304], ideally 
within the first week (7 days) of returning to home; however, it can occur up to 1 month (30 days) from the time of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_104304]. At this visit, the patient will complete the T1 survey via the app, which includes the HADS, PTSS, and PHQ-10 surveys. Score dependent, the patient will be randomized to 1 of 3 arms: Group 1 (Blueprint app), Group 2 (Blueprint app + 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]), and Group 3 (control; no Blueprint app and no therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]). If the patient’s 
psychological distress score is too low; he/she will receive an automated alert via the app describing they are not eligible and their study participation is complete.  
 T2 (Day 30) (+60 days):  this visit is to occur post 1 month randomization for those patients who 
remain eligible to participate in the study. HADS, PTSS, and PHQ-10 surveys will be administered again. If the patient’s survey scores i ndicate high levels of distress, as defined by 
a triggered SI alert or increased distress score from T1, a delegated study team member will contact [CONTACT_104342]. 
 T3 (Day 90) (+30 days):  this visit is to occur post 3 months randomization for those patients 
who remain eligible to participate in the study. HADS, PTSS, and PHQ-10 surveys will be 
administered again. If the patient’s survey scores i ndicate high levels of distress, as defined by 
a triggered SI alert or increased distress score from T1, a delegated study team member will contact [CONTACT_104342]. At the completion of this survey and assuming no additional follow-up is required due to high levels of distress, the patient’s participation in the study is complete.  
 
Additionally, each patient who is randomized will be asked to complete: 
 Weekly Check-In : for those patients who are eligible for randomization to either Groups 1, 2 or 
3, a weekly check-in will be completed by a delegated study team member and/or via the app 
(randomization group dependent). This weekly check in  (i.e., HADS survey) will be available 
beginning day 4 of the week until day 7 of the week.  
 
Compensation  
Compensation for study participation will be provided to each patient via Greenphire. Participates in aim 1 
will receive $20 for study participation and completion of the singular study visit. Participants in aim 2 may receive up to a total of $60 for study completion, $20 for each survey (T1, T2 and T3) to be paid after the 
participant has completed the trial.  
 
8. Enrollment  Sites 
This study will be conducted at Du ke University Health (DUH) and Duke Regional Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (DRH).  
 
It is anticipated that between both sites, the study team will enroll approximately 2/3 of their population from 
DUH (~40 patients) and 1/3 from DRH (~20).    
  
 
 
Protocol version: 1.1  Dated: [ADDRESS_115707] in comparison to a usual 
care control condition. General linear models will be used to estimate mean changes and corresponding 
95% confidence intervals (CIs) in psychological distress (i.e., HADS and PTSS scores) for each treatment group over the [ADDRESS_115708]-randomization fo llow-up using SAS PROC MIXED (SAS Institute, Cary 
NC). We will fit the models with an unstructured covariance matrix to better understand and represent the correlation between patients’ repeated measures. We will also use similar modeling strategies to explore 
how the key clinical characteristics (e.g., history of ICU delirium, illness severity, diagnosis groupi[INVESTIGATOR_007]), 
objective physical characteristics (e.g., functional status), sociodemographic factors, and mechanistic 
elements (e.g. self-efficacy) described in the conceptual model are associated with changes in psychological distress both within and between treatment groups. While for main analyses we will pool all mCST participants in comparisons with usual care contro l, we will also perform exploratory analyses similar 
to those described above to compare all three groups as well.  
 
Sample Size and Power 
This exploratory trial is not intended to test mCST’s efficacy. While the 60-person sample size reflects the 
pragmatics of recruitment during a short enrollment per iod, it is large enough both to inform us about the 
potential challenges of delivering an app-based intervention in the context of post-discharge care as well as 
to provide meaningful confidence intervals for our estimates as was true for the similarly sized LIFT RCT (R34 AT00819).  
 
10. Subject Participation  Duration 
Participating subjects in aim [ADDRESS_115709] daily and completing weekly check-ins. At the end of the 1 month (post T1 completion), the patient 
will be asked to complete T2 survey. Once the patient has completed the T2 survey, he/she is finished with active study participation for an additional [ADDRESS_115710] content; however, no weekly check-in s will be completed at this time.  
 
11. Study Duration 
For this project, Aim 1 (usability testing) is anticipated to take approximately 1-[ADDRESS_115711] is centered around Aim 2 (pi[INVESTIGATOR_4265]), it is anticipated that from the initiation of Aim 2, that it will take 15 months to complete data collection (~12 months for cumulative enrollment with 3 months to complete all long-term follow up). From the time period of completing follow-up, it is estimated that it will 
take an additional 1-3 months for all final analyses to be completed for all Aims.

 12. Risk‐Benefit Assessment  
Potential risks 
It is possible that participating patients could experience a breach of confidentiality should their records be 
accessed unlawfully by [CONTACT_104343], inadvertent error.  In addition, participants may 
experience mild anxiety when answe ring survey questions, though we have not observed this in similar 
interventions such as LIFT or CSTEP.  However, we believe that involvement in this study will present no significant physical, psychological, financial, legal, or other risks.   
 
Adequacy  of protection  against risks:  
Recruitment and informed consent procedures.   
First, the Duke Institutional Review Board (IRB) w ill review and approve the study protocol before study 
initiation. Informed consent (e-consent or written) will be required from all participants, including content experts.  Second, we will use a standardized screening and enrollment protocol that respects participant privacy and rights.  The study team will only approach those patients that are deemed appropriate for the 
study, which will be determined by [CONTACT_104344]/or c onversations with the clinical team and/or PI. The 
approach of patients will be aided by a short IRB-approved recruitment video. The study team will then ask the 
patient to read and sign the study consent form at the time of enrollment.  Potential subjects will be given as 
much time as they need to consider study participation.  For Aim 2, we will take great care to present the treatment group assignment possibilities (“like drawing a number out of a hat”) tactfully and with clearly stated 
equipoise in person or via phone utilizing the IRB appr oved telephone script, as we have done successfully in 
past clinical trials.  A copy of the consent form will be given to participant and the original maintained in a 
secure location at the study site.   
 
Protections  against risk   
General oversight    
There are several ongoing mechanisms for monitoring the occurrence of adverse events.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_104305]-to- day monitoring of the study activities. Careful monitoring of all persons 
entering the study will minimize attrition and will ensure the clinical safety of these patients.  A telephone number for the study team facilitates this moni toring and an email address ([EMAIL_2038]) 
provided to participants upon entry into the study to report concerns related to study participation.  
 
Plans to prevent coercion of patients and to ensure voluntary participation We will strive to create an environment free of any coerci ve practices for patients. We will stress that study 
involvement is voluntary and that choosing to participate or not participate will not affect their care in anyway. 
In addition, we will utilize the standardized 2-minute informational video, which has been used successfully in 
past trials describe treatment groups and ensure a similar approach across sites.   
 Specific longitudinal participant oversight plans for seve re psychological distress (including suicidal ideation) 
Given the difficult situations faced by [CONTACT_1962], we recognize that there is a slight risk that some participants may become distressed completing questionnaires or viewing study materials, as mentioned above.    
We will take the following measures to prevent any  negative reactions as well as effectively manage any 
serious distress that occurs:  
 
(1)  All of the in-person and telephone-based data co llection sessions will be conducted by [CONTACT_104345].  
 
  
 
 
Protocol version: 1.1  Dated: 22 July 2020 Page 15 of 116 
 (2) Study team members will emphasize to participants that  any interviews or other study interactions are 
participant-controlled.  Thus, participants will be instructed that they are in control over what they share and 
generally how long they discuss any topic that is addressed.   
 
(3)  Participants will be told that they can discontinue an interview or telephone session at any time and that they are free to reschedule an interview or treatment session at any time within the week.   
 
(4)  Overall, we are very sensitive to the common and pervasive nature of psychological distress among cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_104306].  There is also a 
potential risk for identifying underlying mental health issues through the mCST sessions, telephone calls, and 
survey responses.  For issues such as passive suicidal  ideation or symptoms of depression, anxiety, or PTSD, 
an informational sheet will be provided with contac t numbers for additional mental health services.  
Additionally, at the beginning of the program, all subjects will be informed that the training program may 
uncover unresolved and distressing thoughts or feelings; and  a list of resources will be provided at that time. 
 
 
Suicidality  Response  Plan  
 
Should a patient indicate to a study team member, thoughts of suicidality or ideation of suicidality, the 
Suicidality Response Plan could be activated. 
 If the participant is deemed to be at high risk based on direct interaction plus the C-SSRS item response, the delegated study team member will administer the C-SSRS to assess the participant to determine if they 
endorse active suicidal ideation.  The trained staff will also determine if the participant is currently being treated by a mental health professional.  
 
If the patient is deemed not to be actively suicidal, they will be given a list of local mental health resources as follows:  
 Duke: Call Emergency Psychiatry at ([PHONE_2382] or ([PHONE_2383], available 24 hours a day, 7 
days a week. 
 The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline - 1-800-273-TALK (8255) is a free, 24-hour hotline available to 
anyone in suicidal crisis or emotional distress. 
 
If the participant is considered actively  suicidal then at least one of the following plans will be followed 
depending on the location of the participant for each of the following situations:  
 Situation [ADDRESS_115712] to the emergency department, or call 
a Psychiatric Emergency services number relevant to the site as described above.  
 
 Situation 2 
o If the participant is on the telephone: 
 The study personnel will notify the site PI [INVESTIGATOR_104307] 
 The study personnel will stay on the telephone with the subject participant. 
 The study personnel will immediately contact 911 to initiate an on-site rescue if such 
action is clinically indicated. 
  
 
 
Protocol version: 1.1  Dated: [ADDRESS_115713] 
contact[CONTACT_104346]. 
 
If the participant is determined to be actively suicidal  and require immediate medical therapy, they will be 
withdrawn from the study. As described above, all concerns about participant safety  will be discussed immediately with the PI - including 
concerning severe distress that does not involve suicidality.   
 
For these situations, once an “alert situation” is known, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_104308] (based on a PI-led phone call) to local psychological resources. The study team will also make urgent and emergency referrals as needed based on information learned.   
To date based on some studies that have included over [ADDRESS_115714] found that <5% of 
participants will require a call from the PI [INVESTIGATOR_104309].  Of those, none has required referral to acute psychiatric care after a detailed interview from the PI.  After a disposition / solution has been made, both the resolution (and follow up) will be documented in the ‘contact [CONTACT_26500]’ section of the data system for reporting to the DSMB.   
 
Patient Death While in Study 
Finally, we recognize that we are working with a critica lly ill population that is at risk for death during follow up 
due to their underlying illness.  Before T2 and T3 data collection, the study team will review the EMR to look for records of death, halting all study procedures if death has occurred and noting the date. On phoning any participant, the study team will initiate a conversation to tactfully ascertain the patient’s vital status should a 
family member answer first.  If the patient has died, the study team will provide brief support and their 
condolences.   
 
Withdraw  While in Study 
If an individual states that they wish to drop out, the study team will respect that as well. A follow-up question 
may be asked to ascertain the reason for withdraw; however, this is for documentation purposes only.  
 
Vulnerable  Populations  
This project will not enroll individuals from vulnerable populations (e.g., imprisoned persons, minors). 
 
Adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events, (SAEs) and unanticipated  problems  (UPs).   
It is recognized that there is a slight risk that some participants may become distressed when completing self-
report measures or participating in interviews.  When necessary, participants who experience psychological 
distress related to completing questionnaires  will be referred for appropriate psychiatric or psychological care.  
All participants will have access to the PI’s contact [CONTACT_82753] 24 hours a day (shown in the consent form).  If 
a telephone interview is required, a trained study team member who has been trained to be sensitive to the nature of these issues will conduct it.   
 
It is anticipated, in this study, for AEs to be extremely ra re as it is a behavioral study. However, it is possible 
that participants could become distressed in a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_104310]-discharge due to increased illness and/or limitations. As such, participants could exhibit signs of and/or experience suicidal ideations or be admitted for mental health symptoms. Therefore, for this study, only increased levels of distress related to completing the 
questionnaires or completing the copi[INVESTIGATOR_104311]/or suicidal ideations will be considered AEs.  
 Like, AEs, it is not anticipated that SAEs will occur. However, for this study, an SAE would be defined as a suicide attempt, a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (post hospi[INVESTIGATOR_104312]’s eligibility for study 
  
 
 
Protocol version: 1.1  Dated: 22 July 2020 Page 17 of 116 
 participation), or death. All serious adverse events will be reported within the standard timelines required to the 
IRB, study sponsor, and/or DSMB, as appropriate and when applicable.  
 Given the nature of this study, it is anticipated that most enrolled patients will not complete their study visits within the assigned protocol window. Additionally , it is expected that visits and/or mCST practices 
will be missed. As such, these will not be consid ered protocol deviations. Should other protocol 
deviations or unanticipated problems occur, they will be discussed with the PI, documented, and 
reported to the IRB, study sponsor, and/or DSMB, as appropriate and when applicable.  
 
Period and Frequency  for Event Assessment  and Follow‐Up 
Protocol deviations and other unanticipated problems, as well as AEs and SAEs, will be recorded in the 
data collection system throughout the study and report ed, as appropriate, to the IRB, study sponsor, 
and/or DSMB, when applicable.   The study team will record all reportable events with  start dates occurring any time after informed 
consent is obtained until 7 (for non-serious AEs) or 30 days (for SAEs) after the last day of study 
participation.  At each study visit, the study team will inquire by [CONTACT_104347]/or 
EMR review, of the occurrence of AE/SAEs since the last visit.  Events will be followed for outcome 
information until resolution or stabilization.  
Characteristics  of an Adverse or Serious Adverse Event 
 
Relationship to Study Intervention To assess relationship of an event to study intervention, the following guidelines are used: 
1. Related (Possible, Probable, Definite) 
a. The event is known to occur with the study intervention. 
b. There is a temporal relationship between the intervention and event onset. c. The event abates when the intervention is discontinued. d. The event reappears upon a re-challenge with the intervention. 
2. Not Related (Unlikely, Not Related) 
a. There is no temporal relationship between the intervention and event onset. 
b. An alternate etiology has been established. 
 
Expectedness  The Study PI [INVESTIGATOR_104313] w hether an event is expected or unexpected.  An 
event will be considered unexpected if the nature, seve rity, or frequency of the event is not consistent 
with the risk information previously described for the intervention.    Severity The following scale will be used to grade adverse events: 
1. Mild: no intervention required; no impac t on activities of daily living (ADL) 
2. Moderate: minimal, local, or non-invasive intervention indicated; moderate impact on ADL 
3. Severe: significant symptoms requiring invasive  intervention; subject seeks medical attention, 
needs major assistance with ADL 
 
Reporting  Procedures  
 
Adverse and Serious Adverse Events 
  
 
 
Protocol version: 1.1  Dated: 22 July 2020 Page 18 of 116 
 For symptoms that are either great in total burden (i.e., total score is high), a delegated study team 
member (e.g., therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]) will call the participant to check in.  For specific symptoms such as the suicidal 
ideation, a delegated study team member will also call the participant and assess the severity of the situation, triaging them as appropriate to psychiatric support.    For other matters, the study team will maintain frequent telephone contact [CONTACT_104348], and can refer those with concerning symptoms.   
All deaths will be reported to NHLBI Program Of ficer and to the DSMB Chair within 72 hours of 
study’s knowledge of death. For each patient who dies , a brief report containi ng the following variables 
will be provided:  
 Age 
 Principal diagnosis 
 Number of comorbidities 
 Admission APACHE II score 
 Days since enrollment 
 Brief description of circumstances surrounding death including expected or unexpected. 
 Serious (fatal or life-threatening) SAEs that are unanticipated and that are related to the intervention will be reported to the NHLBI Program Officer and to the DSMB Chair within 7 days of study staff’s knowledge of the SAE.    
The summary of all other SAEs will be reported to NHLBI Program Officer and to the DSMB quarterly, 
unless otherwise requested by [CONTACT_4318].    
Protocol Deviations  and Other Unanticipated  Problem Reporting   
Incidents or events that meet the reporting criteria, as  outlined by [CONTACT_47482], will be reported to the 
Duke IRB as needed.   The following will be included, at a minimum:  
 A detailed description of the event, incident, experience, or outcome;  
 A description of any changes to the protocol or other corrective actions that have been taken or 
are proposed in response to the unanticipated problem. 
 
Privacy 
The study team will closely safeguard participant privacy regarding protected health and personal information.  
A study ID number will be generated at the time of consent and will be maintained in a secure file (e.g., linker file) which will contain the patient name [CONTACT_39650].  Further, names, birthdates, telephone 
numbers, addresses, and medical record numbers will be stored securely as described in the RDSP and only 
accessible by [CONTACT_104349]. The R edCAP system will store all data on a secure Duke 
University server with a sophisticated dual backup sy stem.  Study participants cannot view data via the ePRO 
system or the electronic data capture (EDC) system, supported by [CONTACT_104329]. Patients will only have 
access to the ePRO system and will access the one-way view  ePRO system via secure, PHI-free email or text 
links sent from the app.  
 
Digital security 
The study digital infrastructure consists of a mobile (i .e., native) app with a built-in electronic patient reported 
outcomes (ePRO) function, an electronic data captur e (EDC) system, and a separate RedCAP digital study 
database. 
  
 
 
Protocol version: 1.1  Dated: 22 July 2020 Page 19 of 116 
  mCST app:   The mCST app will be a native app. The programming service providers, Pattern Health, 
endeavor to build technological solutions that preserve the privacy, confidentiality, and security of protected health information that may be part of health records or research datasets. Protected Health 
Information (PHI) is handled according to appropriate Health Insurance Portability and Accountability 
Act of 1996 (HIPAA) Privacy and Security Regulations.  All staff who work with sensitive data are required to complete appropriate HIPAA training with periodic updates, complete human subjects and data privacy training, comply with site IT Security Po licies, and agree to the provisions of the University 
Rules of Behavior and Sanction Policy.  All sites strive to implement reasonable security controls in its product builds guided by [CONTACT_104350], HIPAA, and OMB Circular A-130, Appendix III. Pattern Health has 
implemented and maintains several security protocols and controls for apps as well.  Pattern Health 
has developed a formal information security program, with a named individual responsible for its overall 
execution.  Pattern Health also periodically cond ucts an information technology (IT) security risk 
assessment on its projects, maintains formal documented protocols for reporting security breaches, assesses and manages security risks associated wi th vendors and subcontractors, maintains employee 
on-boarding and off-boarding policies that protect study data and integrity, and ensures continuing 
employee awareness of and education on security policies, standards, and procedures.  In terms of 
development approaches to security, Pattern Health eval uates and installs security patches in a timely 
fashion, protects systems against self-propagating malware, maintains secure coding policies and practices, and utilizes standardized secure build processes to protect Pattern Health hardware that 
accesses customer networks, protecting confidential data against attack.  All storage of confidential 
participant data on Pattern Health hardware is strictly prohibited, and the use of off-shore service providers and/or data center facilities is prohibited unless approved by [CONTACT_89745].  For our study, the native 
app application and supporting backend system that Pa ttern Health develops will be hosted securely 
per DHTS regulations. 
 EDC:  The EDC has been developed and is supported by [CONTACT_104351], Pattern 
Health. As noted above, Pattern Health maintains all appropriate PHI and HIPAA regulations related to human subject research and data privacy and integrity pertaining to data management and IT security. 
The EDC will be a central location in which all study related data abstracted from each enrolled 
patient’s EMR will be stored. Data will be exported and analyzed for research purposes.  
 REDCap:   The project will utilize a REDCap database system customized for our data needs.  For data 
validation, a series of project-defined data checks and conditional constraints can be required to ensure the highest quality data collection.  All system login procedures and data submissions will be transported and encrypted via the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol to the secure central database at Duke University.  The study team wi ll use login/password (reset every 6 months) 
credentialing for authentication of all study staff.  User-level permissions will be based on user roles 
and defined within the project system to limit a us er’s access to only those records an individual is 
authorized to see. Duke Health Technology Solutions staff to verify that security measures are 
operational will review audit logs routinely.  The servers are scanned twice weekly for vulnerabilities and are currently maintained at the highest level of vendor and CERT security recommendations.  Data 
will never be shared outside the project unless authorized by [CONTACT_104352].  
User authentication is based on user passwords as described earlier.  Password creation requirements are in place to guarantee “strong passwords” as def ined by [CONTACT_104353].  The 
lead systems administrator is GIAC Securi ty Essentials certified through May 2018. 
 
13. Data management  
Most data entry will be self-completed by [CONTACT_3445] s using the validated ePRO system accessed via the 
mCST app. The study team will complete electronic case  report forms (eCRFs) securely integrated within 
the EDC by [CONTACT_104354] h patient’s EMR.  RedCap will be utilized to maintain 
study screening and enrollment logs. The mCST app dashboard, developed by [CONTACT_104355]: 1.1  Dated: 22 July 2020 Page 20 of 116 
 administrative use only, will be accessed and used by  [CONTACT_104356]’ conduct (e.g., study milestones) to enhance the study's quality.  Through this 
dashboard, quality and consistency of data, will be monitored. The Project Manager will do routine data cleaning and statistical team using customized group-blinded reports that will identify missing, outlier, or nonsensical data at time points when remedying them is feasible.  
 
14. Data & Safety Monitoring  Plan 
Plans for Assurance  of Compliance  regarding  Adverse Event Reporting .   
The study team will be required to document and report adv erse events (including serious adverse events) to 
the Institutional Review Board (IRB), as appropriate and in line with institutional reporting criteria. In addition, 
all adverse events are reported as part of NIH Progr ess Reports in the non-competitive and competitive 
renewals.   
 
Plans for Assuring Data Accuracy and Protocol Compliance . 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_104314], including data managem ent, data accuracy, and protocol compliance.  The 
study biostatistician and Project Manager will be the ch ief data managers and will adhere to established federal 
and institutional patient safety and protection guidelines.  To assure data accuracy, the Project Manager will 
review data system reports on a routine basis.  Thes e reports will show enrollment, missing data, and other 
values that are neither study ID- nor outcome-based.  The Project Manager will process detailed reports to search for errors and generate basic reports for dissemination for regular staff meetings.   
 
Data Safety Monitoring  Board (DSMB).  
Aim 2's RCT trial will be supervised by a single independent DSMB composed of professionals with significant 
experience in clinical trials, mind and body interventi ons, epi[INVESTIGATOR_623], and biostatist ics who are not directly 
involved in the study, its interpretation, or any study in stitution and have no active research relationship with a 
study team member.   
 
The main responsibilities of the DSMB will be to (a) assess for the presence of potential harms and unintended consequences of the mCST intervention, (b) ensure the validity and integrity of the data, and (c) make 
recommendations to the investigators and to the NIH about whether the study should be continued without modification, continued with modification, or terminated.  
 
The initial DSMB meeting will occur before the initiation of subject enrollment for the purpose of updating members on the study, ensuring agreement on the review process, establishing the review methodology and procedures, ensuring all conflicts of interest are disclosed (to be reviewed by [CONTACT_104357]), reviewing the protocol, and codifying a written charter.  The NHLBI's Data Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP) Template will be used to guide the drafting of the charter.  This document will specify procedures for protocol amendments, 
ensuring participant confidentiality and privacy, ensuring database protection, coordinating center 
responsibilities, creating adverse outcome definitions  (adverse events, unanticipated problems, and serious 
adverse events), protocol for reporting and respondi ng to adverse events while also maintaining subject 
confidentiality, justifying sample size, assessing accrual and compliance, halting and stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004] (drafted with the assistance of the DSMB chair and the DS MB lead statistician), approving informed consent 
documents, and guidelines for quality control and quality assurance.  Before enrollment begins, the DSMB 
charter will be approved by [CONTACT_104358]; additionally, ClinicalTrials.gov registration will be 
finalized as per the Milestone Plan shown in the Research Strategy document. 
 
The first DSMB data review will occur either after the first [ADDRESS_115715].  Thereafter, the DSMB will review cleaned data reports 
(provided by [CONTACT_21124] 2 weeks before the DSMB meeting) every 3 months during enrollment and 
  
 
 
Protocol version: 1.1  Dated: 22 July 2020 Page 21 of 116 
 follow up, and will prepare a report with any recommendations within 2 weeks following their review.  The 
specific study metrics that the DSMB will review at each meeting include enrollment rate, dropout rate, HADS 
scores, PTSS scores, and Adverse Events.  The primar y safety measures will be Adverse Events reports and 
HADS scores.    Other items reviewed by [CONTACT_104359]: (a) data quality, completeness, and timeliness; (b) performance of the individual sites; (c) adequacy of compliance with goals for recruitment and 
retention, including women and minorities; (d) protocol adherence; and (e) presence of factors that could 
adversely affect study outcome or compromise data conf identiality.  Study participants will be recovering from 
life-threatening illnesses managed in intensive care units, which increase the likelihood of death overtime in 
comparison to healthy individuals.  As such, any patient deaths and their cause during the follow up period will be recorded, discussed, and highly scrutinized.   
 
The study biostatistician will oversee any DSMB statisti cal requests and interpretations.  During the review 
process, formal statistical tests may be performed under DSMB supervision if requested (e.g., examining the differences in Adverse Event or outcome rates between factor-based groups).  Additionally, the DSMB may 
request a formal statistical assessment if a suspi[INVESTIGATOR_104315]-based 
group.  If a specific factor group is found to have a statistically significant increase in HADS score, the DSMB scope of action may include recommendation for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_21356].  For differences in study dropout rates, appropriate changes to the protocol will be made by [CONTACT_976] [INVESTIGATOR_104316].  Any protocol changes, as well as any adverse events, will also be immediately reported to the relevant site IRB, the Central 
Institutional Review Board (located at Duke University), as well as to the NHLBI Program Officer. 
 
Quality Assurance  and Confidentiality  
First, the electronic data entry system “forces” respons es to key questionnaire items (e.g., primary outcomes 
surveys) before allowing progression through the particular interview’s template, thereby [CONTACT_104360].  For less critical items, delayed data entry is possible (though these data elements are non-essential to primary aims analyses). However, each time the study team logs into the secure data entry system, prompts

5. INTRODUCTION TO THE CLINICAL IIWESTIGATION
5.1. Background
Lips belong to the key features of the face, which together with eyes, nose, and cheek bones, are
associated with youth and attractiveness. The shape and fullness of lips are influenced by [CONTACT_390823], including skeletal structure and subcutaneous fat distributions that can dramatically change
their appearance over time.l In recent decades, a greater cultural value on youth and health,
together with improved techniques, have resulted in an increase in cosmetic procedures.
Surgical and cosmetic techniques can change the appearance of the lips in several ways, whether
to enlarge, reduce, or reconstruct after trauma or surgical resection. Lip augmentation procedure
is one of the most sought-after procedures because it aims to return the youthful appearance and it
is also able to improve the shape and fullness of the lips to make them more attractive based on
the current fashion trends. Lip augmentation procedures usually include the implantation of
additional material, either biologic or synthetic, into the lips, which can be injected, introduced by
a threading technique, or by [CONTACT_390824].2
According to the statistics of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons for 2018,3 the number of
lip augmentation (other than injectable materials) procedures increased since 2000 by 660/o to a
total of 30,[ADDRESS_490453] can be reserved for autologous fat injections that may or may not use treatment kits
intended for this purpose. Such kits are considered medical devices that need [LOCATION_002] (US)
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) clearance before commercialization. The duration of the fat
injection effects varies greatly based on the graft survival. Harvested and prepared adipose grafts
need to be injected with substantial overcorrection due to expected resorption, which can Yary
between 30 to 50/o and is generally unpredictable.a
The effect of external fillers can be temporary, semipermanent, or permanent. The US FDA had
only approved one permanent filler as of the end of year 2019 - polymethylmethacrylate beads
suspended in bovine collagen with the addition of lidocaine.5 It is sold under the brand name
[CONTACT_390847]@ (Suneva Medical; previously known as ArteFill@); however, it is contraindicated for use
in lip augmentation.6
Semipermanent fillers approved by [CONTACT_390825]@
(Merz Aesthetics), which is expected to last approximately l8 months, and poly-L-lactic acid sold
as Sculptra@ Aesthetic (Galderma), which is expected to last about [ADDRESS_490454] been approved by [CONTACT_390826] 0FU).7'8
Temporary fillers include collagen and hyaluronic acid (HA) products. Several collagen fillers
were approved by [CONTACT_1622],5 namely Evolence@ Collagen Filler (Colbar Lifescience),
CosmoDermrM (Inamed), CosmoPlastrM (Inamed), Fibrel@ (Serono), Zlplast@ (Collagen Corp),
and Zyderm@ lAllergan); however, all these products have been discontinued by [CONTACT_390827].e
-Page [ADDRESS_490455]@ (Galderma), Restylane@ Silk (Galderma), Restylane-L@ (Galderma),
Juvederm Volbella@ XC (Atlergan) and Juvederm@ Ultra XC (Allergan).
Hyaluronic Acid (HA), also known as hyaluronan, is a long-chain, repeated dimer, of N-acefyl
glucosamine and D-glucuronic acid polymer and it is the most abundant glycosaminoglycan found
in the human dermis. It is a ubiquitous component of all mammalian connective tissues and is
responsible for giving skin its volume while also binding collagen and elastin fibers into a
supportive matrix that gives skin its structure. Due to this extended compatibilify, HA can be used
in humans without unacceptable adverse effects. The HA molecule (or hyaluronan) is a major
component of the extracellular matrix. Due to its natural viscoelastic and hydrogel properties,
hyaluronan is widely used as matrix in tissue regeneration and particularly in dermal defect
reconstruction. Used as a dermal filler, HA has a long track record of safefy data.
The persistence of HA in the tissues and its resistance to degradation can be obtained by [CONTACT_63073]. This does not affect the 2 specific functions of the molecule (carboxylic andN-acetyl
functions) and allows modification of the rheological and physical properties of the HA, while
maintaining the biocompatibility of the basic polymer.r0

was observed between the effects of tested medical devices and comparators, at any time point
except after 18 months, where there was better improvement with RHA@ 2, RHAo 3, and RHA@ 4.

This was a controlled, randomized, double-blinded, within-subject, multicenter, prospective
clinical sfudy of TEOSYAL@ RHA 2 and TEOSYAL@ RHA 3 versus Juvederm@ Ultra XC in the
treatment of moderate to severe nasolabial folds. TEOSYAL@ RHA 2 and TEOSYAL@ RHA 3 are
the respective names of RHA@2, RHAo3, on the European Union market. A total of [ADDRESS_490456] and the other nasolabial fold with the control device; 74 subjects were
allocated to each treatment cohort, 26 subjects were untreated controls. Results showed non-
inferiority of RHA@ 2 and RHA@ 3 compared to Juvederm@. Common Treatment Responses (CTR)
and adverse events (AEs) were recorded and analyzed. For each category of CTR recorded in the
diary (e.g., bruising, firmness, etc.), the proportion of subjects experiencing at least 1 CTR of each
category was similar between treatment groups of each treatment cohort. Additionally, for the
majority of CTRs experienced, the maximal severity experienced was "Mild" or "Moderate." For
some CTRs, such as lumps/bumps and firmness, while the overall proportion of subjects with
events recorded in their diary was similar, the proportion of subjects with events recorded on the
last day of the diary was greater in the RHA@ treatment groups compared to the Juvedermo
treatment groups. By [CONTACT_15094], this led to comparatively higher rates of AEs associated with these
CTRs in the TEOSYAL@ RHA treatment groups. Importantly, virrually all treatment-related AEs
were based on subjects' CTR diary entries, indicating that virhrally all treatment-related AEs were
typi[INVESTIGATOR_2855] (and expected) signs and symptoms observed after injection of a HA dermal filler.
A total of 27 subjects (36.0%;95o/o confidence interval lCIl 130.5, 41.51) in the RHAo 3 group and
26 subjects (34.7%; 95% Cl 129.2, 40.21) in the Juvederm@ treatment group reported at least
I treatment-related AE, respectively. No serious AEs (SAEs) or unanticipated adverse device
effects (UADEs) were reported in the TEOSYAL@ RHA 3/Juvederm@ cohort. The proporrion of
subjects experiencing at least 1 treatment-related AE was lower in subjects with Fitzpatrick skin
type IV-VI. In subjects with Fitzpatrick skin type I-III, treatment-related AEs were noted in
2l (47.7%) and 19 (43,2%) subjects in the TEOSYAL@ RHA 3 and Juvederm@ treatment groups,
respectively. In subjects of Fitzpatrick skin type IV-VI, treatment-related AEs were noted in

o Bleeding
o Blistering
o Bruising (ecchymosis)
o Increased bleeding or bruising at the injection site if using medications that reduce the
ability to clot (such as aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], ibuprofen [e.g., Motrin@ or Advil@], vitamin E and
prescription anticoagulants)
o Pain at and around the injection site that could induce lightheadedness or fainting
6.4.2. Risks Associated With the Anesthetic Agent (Lidocaine) or Other Allergens
Subjects with known history of allergy to lidocaine or Gram-positive bacterial proteins should not
receive any injection as both sfudy devices contain them and they risk anaphylactic shock.
Reported anaphylactic shocks are very rare.
The concentration of lidocaine is low and the risk of other types of allergic reactions is low. Those
allergic reactions may include skin rash, redness, itching, hives, burning, stinging, swelling,
tenderness, and temporary loss of skin color.

9. CLINICAL II\I!'ESTIGATION TREATMENT AND FOLLOW.UP
9.1. Subject Informed Consent
All suitable candidates being considered for enrollment in the clinical investigation will meet with
the TI or designee and have the investigation explained in detail. This will include, but will not be
limited to, the potential risks and benefits of participation. Each subject will be provided with a
written copy of the informed consent in a language he/she can comprehend and will be given ample
opporhrnity to read and pose questions he/she may have about the investigation. If, after review,
the subject agrees to participate, he/she will sign the ICF. If the subject subsequently fails to meet
eligibility criteria, he/she will be considered a screen failure and will not receive treatment with
the study device or the control device under the clinical investigation. The TI should, with the
subject's consent, inform the subject's primary physician about his/her participation in the clinical
study.
Information regarding changes in the clinical investigation or new information obtained that could
significantly affect a subject's future health and/or medical care must be provided to all subjects
in written format. Subjects should be asked to reaffirm their continuing informed consent.
Failure to obtain signed informed consent prior to the use of the study device constitutes a major
CIP violation and noncompliance with 2l CFR$ 50.20 and/or ISO [ZIP_CODE]. If informed consent is
not obtained, the subject's participation will be terminated, and his/her data will not be used. The
TI will provide a written report to the sponsor indicating the failure to obtain signed informed
consent within the reporting timelines required by [CONTACT_63081]/national laws.
The sponsor or designee will then inform the appropriate agencies/committees according to
applicable national regulations.
9.2. Randomization

10.1.6. Device Malfunction
Device malfunction is a failure of the device to perform in accordance with its intended purpose
when used in accordance with the IFU/IB or CIP. A device malfunction may or may not be
associated with an AE. If it is, the AE or ADE should be reported separately.
10.2. Evaluation and Assessment
For the purposes of this investigation, any untoward medical occurrence, unintended disease or
injury, or any untoward clinical signs that occurs in a subject after randomization is considered an
AE, regardless of the investigation group to which the subject is assigned.
Any medical conditions, problems, signs, symptoms, and findings that occur prior to
randomization are to be reported as pre-existing conditions. Such conditions should be documented
and reported on the medical history eCRF as a pre-existing condition. If a pre-existing condition
worsens after randomization (frequency increases and/or severity grade increases), it should be
documented as an AE.

14.2. Conflict of Interest
The FDA reviews the financial interests of TIs (or subinvestigators and their spouses and/or
dependent children) in an IDE investigation. If the FDA believes that the financial interests of any
TI raises a serious question about the integrity of the data, the FDA may take any action it deems
necessary to ensure the reliability of the data, including the following:
o Initiating agency audits of the data derived from the TI in question
o Requesting that the applicant submit further analyses of data, e.g., to evaluate the effect of
the TI's data on the overall investigation outcome
. Requesting that the applicant conduct additional independent studies to confirm the results
of the questioned investigation
Therefore, any TI (or subinvestigator), their spouses, and/or dependent children who has a
potential conflict of interest with this investigation (patent ownership, royalties, or financial gain
greater than the minimum allowable by [CONTACT_1385], etc.) must have the conflict evaluated by
[CONTACT_456]. If a financial interest appears to exist, a management plan should be generated to
minimize bias and must be approved by [CONTACT_63092].
14.3. Institutional Review Board/Competent Authority Approval
A properly constituted, valid IRB must review and approve the CIP, the ICF, and related subject
information and recruitment materials before the start of the investigation. It is the responsibility
of the TI to obtain approval of the CIP from the institution's IRB and to keep the IRB informed of
any SAEs and amendments to the CIP. Additional requirements imposed by [CONTACT_390838]. A11 correspondence with the IRB should be
filed by [CONTACT_63094][INVESTIGATOR_63065]'s designee(s).

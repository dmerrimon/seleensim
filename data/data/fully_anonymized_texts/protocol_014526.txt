Brief Summary of Research (250- 400 words):  
Colorectal neoplasms are the third most common malignancies in the [LOCATION_002]  and a major 
cause of mortality in our population. Patients with metastatic (stage IV) colorectal cancer have a 
median life expectancy of [ADDRESS_361331] incurable disease.  
Response rates to chemotherapy range from 35 -40%.   
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_295970]. Further, preclinical data support the concept that genistein, a soy -derived substance, may 
serve a role in prevention of colorectal cancers. Laboratory analyses demonstrate that genistein inhibits Wnt signaling, a pathway activated in majority of colon cancers. Additionally, in vitro 
observations suggest that combining genistein with chemotherapeutic agents augments growth inhibition of colon cancer cell lines.  The primary agents that have improved activity in the 
laboratory with the addition of genistein are platinum compounds and 5- fluorouracil.  
Based on pre -clinical data, the purpose of the study is to combine genistein with standard of care 
treatment in patients with metastatic colorectal cancers. We hypothesize that combining genistein 
with standard of care  FOLFOX or FOLF OX-Avastin chemotherapy regimen s will lead to reduced 
chemotherapy resistance and improve response rates in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.   
FOLFOX and FOLFOX -avastin are stan dard first line chemotherapy regimens for patients with 
metastatic colorectal cancer.  Each contains 5 -fluorouracil (F) and a platinum agent, oxaliplatin 
(OX). 
Genistein is classified by [CONTACT_4760] a GRAS compound – generally recognized as safe.  It is a 
derivative of soy and classified as a nutritional supplement; therefore, it is not regulated as a drug by [CONTACT_1622].  It has minimal side effects at dosages which have been studies (up to 600mg/day)  
and there no evidence that this compound has any effect on t he toxicity of standard chemotherapy.    
The aim of the study is to recruit newly diagnosed patients with colon or rectal cancers  who have 
already been identified to receive either FOLFOX or FOLFOX -A by [CONTACT_86297].  
Genistein will be administered in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_6522] m with every chemotherapy treatment . Patients will 
be carefully monitored for toxicity. Response rates in all patients will be measured by [CONTACT_295978].  We hypothesize that genistein will improve response rates over published 
historical control response rates for these regimens.

2) Background  
Colorectal cancers (CRC) are the third most common malignancy in [LOCATION_002] and represent a 
significant cause of cancer related mortality.  While therapeutic options for patients with 
metastatic colorectal cancer have improved over the past decade, the vast majority of th ese 
patients, up to 90%, die from their metastatic disease.  Therefore, it is important that new approaches for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer continue to be explored.  
 
Colorectal malignancies are less common in East Asia where diet is thoug ht to contain more soy. 
Soy products have some estrogenic properties and evidence suggests that estrogen may play a protective role in colon cancer prevention and that women are less likely than men to develop CRC [1].  Additionally, hormone replacement therapy has demonstrated colon cancer risk reduction in post -menopausal women [2].  Epi[INVESTIGATOR_295971] a correlation between soy 
consumption and colon cancer risk reduction, as well as reduction in adenomatous polyposis [3- 7].  
In vitro data and in vivo animal studies have demonstrated that the soy -derived compound, 
genistein has colon cancer prevention activity [8 -10].  This provides a rationale for the study of 
genistein, which is a naturally derived product classified as a nutritional supplement, in the 
treatment of human colorectal cancer.  Genistein is classified as a GRAS (generally recognized as 
safe) substance by [CONTACT_1622].  
 
Prior studies and recent data from our laboratory demonstrate that colon cancer cell growth is inhibited when cell lines are treated with genistein [11- 13].  The mechanism by [CONTACT_295979].  The Wnt signaling is activated in > 85% of 
patients with colon cancer [14]. Genistein inhibits Wnt signaling by [CONTACT_295980]2 and other mechanisms may also be operative
 
[15].  The uniform activation of Wnt signaling in colon cancer, and the activity of genistein to 
inhibit Wnt signaling, makes its use in patients with colorectal cancer potentially rewarding.  
 
There is also strong in vitro evidence suggests that genistein reduces chemotherapy resistance in 
cancer cell lines treated in combination with genistein and either 5FU or platin- class 
chemotherapeutic agents [16 -18].  The primary chemotherapeutic regimen utilized for the 
treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer is a combination of 5FU and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX), with or without  the anti-angiogenic agent bevacizumab (Avastin®).  Genistein may therefore be 
beneficial for patients treated with these agents.

c) Number of Subjects 
The published R esponse R ates (RR)  to FOLFOX and FOLFOX- A are 38% [19].  We plan to treat  
[ADDRESS_361336] identical RR, both 
groups will be analyzed together for RR.  However, PFS is longer for FOLFOX -A than FOLFOX 
so analysis will be stratified for this secondary endpoint and also for toxicity evaluation.  RR will be compared to previously published data
 [19].   Should a trend toward improved response rate be 
seen, and genistein well tolerated without significant toxicities, then this pi[INVESTIGATOR_222593] a rationale for a larger, placebo -controlled trial to confirm the effect of genistein on response rate in 
this patient population. 
 
d) Study Timelines  
We anticipate all enro lment to be complete in 12 months. Patients will complete 6 -12 cycles of 
chemotherapy (approximately 3 -6 months of treatment ) with genistein.  Response rate will be 
determined based on standard- of-care radiographic testing performed at standard time points .  
Patients will have  follow up for progression and survival for [ADDRESS_361337] progression free survival.  Data  analysis and publication will 
occur subsequently by [CONTACT_96138] 2. 
e) Endpoints  
Primary Endpoint:  
- Evaluation of tolerability of genistein treatment.  
o A brief survey about side effects will be conducted with every  chemotherapy/geni stein cycle.  
Secondary Endpoint s: 
- Response Rate (RR) as measured by [CONTACT_295984].  
o Under RECIST criteria Complete Response (CR) is defined as disappearance of all target lesions and reduction in the short axis measurement of all pathologic lymph nodes to ≤10mm.

Revised 7/20/[ADDRESS_361338] criteria Partial Response (PR) is defined as ≥30% decrease in 
the sum of the longest diameters of the target lesions compared with baseline.) 
o Progression of disease (Progression of Disease (PD) defined by [CONTACT_295985]  ≥ 20% increase of at least 5mm in the sum of the longest diameters of the target lesions compa red with the smallest sum of the longest diameter 
recorded OR the appearance of new lesions)  
o No patients will be treated longer than 12 cycles (6 months) on this protocol. 
o Progression of disease will lead to a change in chemotherapy regimen and will result in termination of the subject’s participation in this study.  
- Progression Free Survival (PFS) 
o Patients will be monitored for progression during the study period and for 1 year following.  
f) Procedures Involved in the Human Research  
FOLFOX or FOLFOX- A will be  given every [ADDRESS_361339] of care. The 
chemotherapy administration is in itself not a component of research for this study.  It is recommended that the FOLFOX regimen utilized is mFOLFOX -6 either alone, or in 
combination with bevacizumab (Avastin).  The dosages and schedule for medications utilized with mFOLFOX -6 and mFOLFOX-6-A, given on a q14 day cycle, are as follows: 
 Oxaliplatin  85mg/m2  250cc D5W over 2 hours IVPB  Day 1 
Leucovorrin 400mg/m2 250cc D5W over 2 hours IVPB  Day 1 
Fluorouracil 400mg/m2 50cc D5W IVPB over 15 minutes or IVP over 2- 4 minutes  Day 1 
Fluorouracil 2400mg/m2 In D5W IV Continuous Infusion over 46 hour Start Day 1  
 With or without: Bevacizumab  5mg/kg  250cc NS over 30 minutes IVPB  Day 1 
  
 
Genistein will be administered orally  for 7 days every 2 weeks, beginning 4 days prior to 
FOLFOX or FOLFOX- A and continuing during the 3 days of chemotherapy.  This schedule is 
chosen because genistein achieves steady state in the serum within 4 days based on prior pharmaco kinetic studies [20- 26]. Elimination half life approximately 8 -10 hours postulating 
complete elimination of genistein within 2 days of completion of this agent. Genistein has been administered to humans at dosages of 30- 600mg/day without any significant adverse effects [24].  
The dose to be utilized will be 60mg/day.

Toxicity assessment will be performed prior to every cycle  of FOLFOX or FOLFOX -A by [CONTACT_295986]: 1) any toxicity from 4 days of genistein alone and 2) any toxicities 
from prior cycle of FOLFOX or FOLFOX -A with genistein. Toxicity will be evaluated by 
[CONTACT_295987] .  Blood work performed by [CONTACT_295988] , which is standard practice and not part of the study, will also be 
reviewed and recorded.  
 
Response rates will be assessed during restaging evaluations  by [CONTACT_295989] -CT or 
CT scan radiologic imaging at routine time points.  The specific type of staging test utilized will 
be at the discretion of the treating clinician.  Results of laboratory and radiologic studies will be 
extracted from EPIC  or paper records . All this testing is standard of care.  
 
Compliance with self-administration  of genistein will also be evaluated prior to every c ycle

4. A faculty-level review committee of experienced clinical trials investigators will 
be convened to analyze toxicities and risks of the study.   This Review Committee 
will be comprised of:  
 PI: [INVESTIGATOR_295975], MD  
      
Independent faculty members: Matthew Galsky, MD, Philip Friedlander, MD 
 The Review Committee will evaluate the safety of the first 3 recruited subjects after 
2 cycles of chemotherapy. Recruitment will continue unless 1) unanticipated 
toxicities of greater than grade 2 or 2) any grade 4 toxicities occur.  If either of these  
situations arise, accrual will be placed on hold and data will be presented to the 
DSMC for additional recommendations.  Identical analysis will occur at  at 6 months 
or at recruitment of 12 patients (half of total cohort) whichever comes first  (Interim 
Analysis) . 
The Tisch Cancer Institute Data Safety and Monitoring Committee will also provide additional and independent oversight of the conduct of the study. 
5. The study will be discontinued if an increased number of  adverse effects is seen as 
outlined in section 4, above and this is recommended by [CONTACT_295997].  The study will also be discontinued if there is a 20% or greater  
increase in the number of deaths compared to expected number in patients with newly 
diagnosed metastatic colorectal cancer  population based on prior published data [19].  
Any treatment -related  death while on study will lead to an immediate hold on accrual and 
review by [CONTACT_295998].  The 
study will be reopened to accrual only with permission from this committee.  If two 
treatment -related  deaths occur for patients while on study, the protocol will be 
permanently closed to accrual.  
6. Genistein has been administered to humans at dosages of 30- 600mg/day without any 
significant adverse effects [24].  The dose to be utilized will be 60mg/day which is a 
dose previously utilized in trials for men with prostate cancer where no clinically 
significant side effects were noted  and for which prolonged administration schedules 
have had documented pharmacokinetic analysis [25].

7. Toxicity will be evaluated with a ques tionnaire based on previously published adverse 
effects of genistein.   Any other toxicities will be graded according to the National 
Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria.  
8. Data accuracy and completeness will be ensured by [CONTACT_295999] 
(PI) and the Data Safety and Monitoring Committee. 
9. In case of suspension of the study, occurrence will be reported to the IRB and the 
sponsor (DSM pharmaceuticals ) 
10. Chemotherapy treatment delays:  
 Planned delay in treatment – for planned delays in treatment, genistein administration 
will be delayed concurrently so as to be administered along with the standard 
chemotherapy as outlined. 
Unplanned delays in treatment – For unplanned delays in treatment, such as when 
neutrophil or platelet counts are insufficient to administer chemotherapy, patients will have already taken 4 days of genistein.  Genistein will be stopped for this cycle and resumed in conjunction with the rescheduled treatment, beginning 4 days prior to the rescheduled treatment date an d continuing for 7 days as outlined.

(DMC/DSMB) 
j) Please refer to Section F -i-4. Withdrawal of Subjects  
Participation in the study is voluntary. Subjects may choose to withdraw at any point. 
Participation in the study may be stopped by [CONTACT_296000], harmful or has medically unacceptable side effects .  
6) Risks to Subjects  
Previous studies in healthy volunteers and patients with prostate cancer treated with genistein demonstrate low risk of adverse events with this medication  and previously 
reported adverse events were described as mild .
20-26  Risks to subjects include side effects  
from the study drug such as  increased  hot flashes, headache, edema, constipation, 
gynecomastia, nipple tenderness, nausea and rarely increased amylase/lipase levels . 
Patients of childbearing age are advised not to get pregnant as the effect of the drug on 
the fetus is unknown.  Patients who are currently p regnant or breastfeeding will be 
excluded from the study. Patients with personal history of breast, ovarian or uterine

chemotherapy associated toxicities.  
 
7) Provisions for Research Related Harm/Injury  
Subjects will be followed routinely by [CONTACT_296001]. 
Adverse events will be routinely evaluated at each office and chemotherapy visit. Should any adverse effects occur, they will be immediately evaluated and managed  by [CONTACT_296002]. 
In case of injury or adverse event related to participating in this research study, the facilities at Mount Sinai Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_295976]. Financial compensation from Mount 
Sinai will not be provided
. 
8) Potential Benefits to Subjects  
Response rate in metastatic colorectal cancer treated with FOLFOX or FOLFOX -
Avastin is approximately 38%. The hypothesis of the study is that addition of genistein 
to standard of care chemotherapeutic regimen will improve response rates. This may 
translate into longer progression free survival (PFS) and/or longer overall  survival (OS) 
which may be of great benefit to individual patients. 
9) Provisions to Protect the Privacy Interests of Subjects  
Written Informed consent will be obtained in the Investigators’ private offices in order to maintain confidentiality .  If patients find any procedures, tests or questionnaires 
uncomfortable they may speak with the investigator and can decline to get the test done. 
Patients will be informed about health information and confidentiality. Subjects will be 
informed that certain parties will have access to confidential health information including the treating team, research team and also possibly IRB , governmental regulatory agencies 
and the sponsor. Patients will be made aware that participation in the study is purely voluntary and should they wish to withdraw their consent at any point, the subjects will not be penalized at any point.

training. The study team will ask permission and obtain authorization from each participant regarding access to personal health information including demographics, past and present medica l records, research records, records about phone calls made as part of 
the study and records about study visits.
 
10) Economic Impact on Subjects  
Genistein will be provided free of charge by  [CONTACT_456]. The rest of clinical care is part 
of routine standard- of-care in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.  Data 
management costs will be covered by [CONTACT_296003].  We do not anticipate that subjects will incur 
any additional costs through participation in the trial.  
 
11) Payments to Subjects  
Subjects will not be paid for participation in this trial.  
12) Consent Process 
 Subjects will be identified and screened during clinic visits and on inpatient wards. For 
subjects interested in study participation informed consent will be obtained by [CONTACT_976] [INVESTIGATOR_5768] -
investigator.  
 Informed consent will be obtained following HRP -090-SOP - Informed Consent Process for 
Research. The patients will have an opportunity to discuss t he clinical trial, read through the 
consent form at their leisure, and ask questions of the treating Investigator. To ensure that the subjects understand they would be asked to reiterate in their own words the purpose of the research, what they will need t o do as participants in the study, and what the potential risks, 
potential benefits and alternatives are.  
 If the patient does not speak or read English, then the consent will be provided in patient’s native language.  If a translated consent becomes neces sary, one wi ll be submitted for review 
and approval to the IRB with a letter of attestation.  T o ensure that the study procedures are 
adequately explained to non- English speaking subjects, a translator will be present at the time 
of the consent process to explain and obtain consent, and answer questions that the subject 
may have
. 
Short Form Consent Policy 
The patient population for this study will include English speaking subjects. However, it is possible that a patient may be approached for consent who does not speak these languages. In such cases, PPHS/CCTO Short Form Policy procedures will be followed.

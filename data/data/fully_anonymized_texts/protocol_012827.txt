Version 3.0 5  PR/TIOL -202-TPAS  1.0 SYNOPSIS  
STUDY TITLE : Post-Approval Study  of the TECNIS® Toric  IOL, 
Models ZCT300 and ZCT400  
 Protocol: TIOL-202-TPAS  
STUDY TREATMENT S: Toric  Study Lenses :   
• TECNIS Toric 1 -Pi[INVESTIGATOR_203156], Model ZCT300 (and 
PCT300)  
• TECNIS Toric  1-Pi[INVESTIGATOR_203156], Model ZCT400 (and 
PCT400)  
The ZCT300 and ZCT400 lens models (as well as 
PCT300 and PCT400) are intended for cataract 
patients with pre -existing corneal astigmatism that, 
when surgically induced astigmatism (SIA) is taken 
into account, have approximately 2.00 D to 3.62  D of 
predicted corneal astigmatism to be corrected.   
Note: The PCT models (PCT300 and PCT400) are 
the same IOLs as the ZCT models with the exception that they are provided preloaded in the TECNIS iTec 
Deliver y System .  For reference in this protocol, PCT 
is the same as ZCT.   
Control Lens:   
• TECNIS  Monofocal 1-Pi[INVESTIGATOR_203156], Model  ZCB00 
(and PCB00)  
Note: Model PCB00 is the Model ZCB00 IOL preloaded into the TECNIS iTec Delivery System and may also be used as the control lens.   For reference 
in this protocol, PCB00 is the same as ZCB00.  
STUDY OBJECTIVE:  The purpose of this post-approval study  is to 
evaluate the rates of visual distor tions for the 
TECNIS Toric IOLs with >2.[ADDRESS_946835] (Models ZCT300 and ZCT400) 
in a larger population in clinical practice compared to 
ABBOTT MEDICAL OPTICS INC. CONFIDENTIAL  
Version 3.0 6  PR/TIOL -202-TPAS  a non- toric control IOL and to ensure the continued 
safety of the approved devices.  
CLINICAL HYPOTHESIS : The rate  of severe visual distortions  for the TECNIS 
Toric IOL Models ZCT300 and ZCT400 will be less  
than 10  percentage points above that  for a non-toric 
control group with the same level of preoperative 
corneal astigmatism.   
OVERALL STUDY DESIGN:   
Structure:  Prospective, multi -center, bilateral, non -randomized, 
open- label, comparative clinical study

Duration:  Six months; however, any subjects that undergo a 
lens repositioning procedure due to IOL misalignment or that report a severe  visual distortion at six months, 
will be followed through 1 year postoperatively.   
Administration:  Emmetropia will be targeted for both eyes.   Surgeons 
will perform routine small- incision, 
phacoemulsification cataract surgery and use the AMO -recommended implantation systems for lens 
implantation.  
Visit Schedule:  Subjects will be bilaterally implanted; the second eye 
is to be implanted within approximately  one month 
after the first eye surgery .   
 Subjects will undergo two postoperative visit s at 
[ADDRESS_946836] will also 
undergo a final visit at 1 year.

Primary Endpoint:  
Rate of severe visual distortions; defined as the percentage of  subject s who report  a 
severe visual distortion under overall circumstances at [ADDRESS_946838] : 
 
o lines that slant, tilt, split or separate    
o flat surfaces appearing curved 
o objects appearing further away or closer than they actually are  
o objects appearing to have a different size or  shape 
o physical discomfort  related to vision  
 
 
Other Endpoints:  
• Ratings  of individual items included on the visual distortion questionnaire  
• Rates of IOL repositioning procedures (secondary surgical intervention) due to 
IOL misalignment  
• Rates of other adverse events  
 
VISITS AND PROCEDURES:   
All subjects enrolled in the study will sign the IRB-approved informed consent prior to 
any study -specific testing or administration of the questionnaire .  Each subject will 
choose to receive the same lens type in both eyes, either the TECNIS Toric IOLs 
(Models ZCT300 and/or ZCT400), or the non-toric control IOL (TECNIS Model ZCB00).   
VISIT SCHEDULE :  All subjects are intended to have bilateral cataract surgery with the 
second- eye surgery occurring within approximately [ADDRESS_946839] -eye surgery  
(≤60 days) .  Two postoperative study visit s will be conducted; at 1 month  
ABBOTT MEDICAL OPTICS INC. CONFIDENTIAL  
Version 3.0 9  PR/TIOL -202-TPAS  (30-60 days after the second- eye surgery) and at 6 months (120- 180 days after the 
second- eye surgery) for both eyes together.  However, subjects who underwent an IOL 
repositioning procedure due to IOL misalignment or who reported a severe visual 
distortion at 6 months will return for a final visit at 1 year (330 -420 days after the  
second- eye surgery) postoperatively.   
PREOPERATIVE PROCEDURES:   Following informed consent, a subject questionnaire 
for determination of visual distortions will be administered (Patient Reported Visual 
Distortion Questionnaire; PRVDQ) .  Demographic, general preoperative and operative 
information will be collected from routine cataract evaluation examinations and surgical 
reports.   
POSTOPERATIVE PROCEDURES:   At the 1-month visit, a spectacle and/or contact 
[CONTACT_32492] .  If the subject has a spontaneous report 
of any of the [ADDRESS_946840] questionnaire 
(Patient Reported Visual Dist ortion Questionnaire; PRVDQ) for determination of visual 
distortions , biomicroscopic slit -lamp examination for any adverse events  and, for 
subjects with toric IOLs, determination of toric IOL axis position and keratometry .  
If outside of a scheduled study visit, a subject has a spontaneous report of ; 1) any of the 
[ADDRESS_946841] or 2) blurred or hazy vision at [ADDRESS_946842] reports a severe visual distortion 
at the 6 -month examination or experienced an IOL repositioning procedure (due to I OL 
misalignment during the study).   
If a serious or device- related adverse event occurs at or prior to the 6- month visit, details 
of the event will be collected at the time of the event using an adverse event form.  If the 
adverse event is an IOL misalign ment resulting in an IOL repositioning procedure, the 
questionnaire is to be administered prior to the repositioning procedure to collect 
information regarding visual distortions , and, for subjects with toric IOLs,  keratometry 
and toric IOL axis  measuremen ts will be performed prior to the repositioning procedure 
to collect data regarding the IOL misalignment .   
ABBOTT MEDICAL OPTICS INC. CONFIDENTIAL  
Version 3.0 10  PR/TIOL -202-TPAS  DATA ANALYS IS:   
The rate of severe  visual distortions as defined by [CONTACT_941] 5 items listed under primary 
endpoint will be compared between bilaterally -implanted toric IOL subjects and 
bilaterally -implanted non- toric control IOL subjects at 6 months . The frequency and 
proportion of toric and non- toric control subj ects with severe visual distortions will be 
reported.  Results between the toric IOL and the non- toric control IOL groups will be 
evaluated using a non- inferiority approach with a non- inferiority margin of 10% .  
Assessment of toric IOL axis  misalignment will be compared to reports of visual 
distortions.  
The frequency and proportion of secondary surgical interventions due to IOL 
misalignment, as well as rates for other adverse events  or medical and lens finding s, will 
be reported  by [CONTACT_1570].  Evaluat ion at 6 months  will include reporting by  
[CONTACT_697581], including severity for serious 
adverse events and adverse device effects.  
Visual distortion findings, adverse events and  medical/lens findings at one year will be 
reported for subjects who experienced a repositioning procedure during the study or for 
subjects who were reported with severe visual distortions at the 6 -month visit . 
2.0 BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE OF STUD Y 
It is estimated that 35% of cataract patients have ≥1.00 diopter of corneal astigmatism1 
with 15% -20% having ≥1.[ADDRESS_946843] surgery (e.g., limbal 
relaxing incisions, etc .), toric IOLs are now commonly used for correction of aphakia and 
pre-existing ocular  astigmatism.  On April 15, 2013, Abbott Medical Optics (AMO) 
received [LOCATION_003] FDA approval (P980040/S039) for  the TECNIS 1-Pi[INVESTIGATOR_697555], Models 
ZCT150, ZCT225, ZCT300 and ZCT400 for the visual correction of aphakia and pre-
existing corneal astigmatism of one diopter or greater .    
In the IDE registration trial of the TECNIS 1-Pi[INVESTIGATOR_697555]  (G090251) , rotational 
stability was demonstrated and there were minimal subject complaints of  visual 
distortions ; however, there is the potential , particularly in the case of toric IOLs that 
correct for higher amounts of corneal astigmatism, that patients may experience spatial 
distortions related to axis misalignment, e.g., whether objects appear tilted or misshapen, etc.  As a condition of approval, this post-approval study will be conducted to 
ABBOTT MEDICAL OPTICS INC. CONFIDENTIAL  
Version 3.0 11  PR/TIOL -202-TPAS  evaluate visual distortions of the TECNIS Toric  1-Pi[INVESTIGATOR_697556] ≥ 2.[ADDRESS_946844] (Models  ZCT300 and ZCT400)  and to ensure the 
continued safety of the approved devices.   
3.[ADDRESS_946845] -approval study is to evaluate the rates of severe visual 
distortions for the TECNIS 1-Pi[INVESTIGATOR_697557] ≥2.[ADDRESS_946846] (Models  ZCT300 and ZCT400) in a larger population in clinical practice 
compared to a non-toric, control  IOL, and to ensure the continued safety of  the approved 
devices.  
4.0 STUDY DESIGN 
This study is a prospective, multicenter, bilateral, non- randomized, open- label,  
comparative clinical study conducted at up to 80 sites in the [LOCATION_003].  Subjects will choose 
to be bilaterally implanted with either 1) the TECNIS 1-Pi[INVESTIGATOR_697558], Model ZCT300 
and/or ZCT400, or 2) the TECNIS Monofocal Model ZCB00 non-toric control IOL, 
according to subject  preferenc e. 
5.[ADDRESS_946847] questionnaire (PRVDQ) . 
  
ABBOTT MEDICAL OPTICS INC. CONFIDENTIAL  
Version 3.0 12  PR/TIOL -202-TPAS  The r ate of severe visual distortions  is defined as the percentage of subjects who report 
a severe visual distortion under overall circumstances at [ADDRESS_946848]:  
o lines that slant, tilt, split or separate    
o flat surfaces appearing curved 
o objects appearing further away or closer than they actually are  
o objects appearing to have a different size or shape 
o physical discomfort  related to vision  
 
Distortions will be assessed using the overall c ircumstance reply  at the 
6-month visit .  The frequency and proportion of subjects reporting one or 
more of these items as severe will be used to determine the rate of 
severe visual distortions.  
Success criter ia:   Rates of severe visual distortions for the TECNIS 1-Pi[INVESTIGATOR_697559] 10  percentage points above 
rates  for the non-toric control IOL group .

Version 3.0 13  PR/TIOL -202-TPAS  ZCT300 and ZCT400 lens models, in particular,  are intended for cataract patients with 
pre-existing corneal astigmatism that, when taking surgically induced astigmatism into 
account, have approximately 2.00 D to 3.62 D of predicted corneal astigmatism to be 
corrected ( Table 1).  
Note : The PCT models (PCT300 and PCT400) are the same IOLs as the ZCT models 
with the exception that they are provided preloaded in the TECNIS iTec Delivery 
System .  Similarly,  Model PCB00 is the Model ZCB00 IOL preloaded into the TECNIS 
iTec Delivery System and may also be used as the control lens.   For reference in this

with toric IOLs, keratometry and toric IOL axis measurements will also be performed.  
If a serious or device- related adverse event occurs at or prior to the 6- month visit, details 
of the event will be collected at the time of the event using an adverse event form.  If the 
adverse event results in  an IOL repositioning procedure due to  misalignment, the 
questionnaire should be administered prior to the procedure to collect information regarding visual distortions , and for subjects with toric IOLs,  keratometry and toric IOL 
axis measurements will be performed prior to the repositioning procedure to collect data 
regarding the IOL misalignment .

subject questionnaire assessing visual distortions (Appendix B), as well as any other 
preoperative procedures that are not already performed during  the investigator’s routine  
cataract evaluation for astigmatic patients (e.g., potential visual acuity) .  To ensure 
subjects in both lens groups meet eligibility criteria, d ocumentation via the AMO T oric 
IOL C alculator options of ZCT300 and/or ZCT400 for each eye of each subject is 
required.  A s toric IOL calculations are not generally  performed for non -toric IOL 
surgeries, the use of the AMO T oric IOL Calculator may be considered study -specific  for 
subjects who choose to be implanted with the control, non- toric IOL .    
Preoperative data  will be collected o n the preoperative case report form (CRF)  and

LENS POWER CALCULATIONS  AND IOL SELECTION:   
For lens power calculations, the investigator’s personalized A -Constant for the TECNIS 
monofocal ZCB00 lens is to be used for both the ZCB00 and Toric  ZCT IOLs.  The 
spherical  equivalent lens  power , as determined by [CONTACT_093]’s standard biometry 
methods , should be calculated to achieve emmetropia (± 0.50 D) at distance  for all eyes .  
Intentional overcorrection or under -correction (i.e., monovision or outside ± 0.50 D) 
should NOT  be planned for either eye; however, surgeons may adjust the targeted 
refraction as necessary to achieve emmetropia  based on their surgeon factor, study 
subject experience and/or subject first -eye outcomes .     
In order to verify subject eligibility and to optimize toric IOL selection and axis placement, 
investigators will use the web-based AMO  Toric IOL  Calculator  
(www.TecnisToricCalc.com ) to determine the appropriate TECNIS Toric IOL model 
(ZCT300 and/or ZCT400  for this study ) for each  eye.  Note that the AMO T oric IOL 
calculator provides  toric IOL options  based on predicted astigmatism, i.e., the vector 
sum of pre-existing corneal astigmat ism and the expected effect of SIA.  For this  study, 
subjects are to have corneal astigmatism  that, when taking SIA into account, have 
approximately 2.00 D to 3.62 D of predicted cor neal astigmatism to be corrected and 
quali fy for implantation of a ZCT300 and/or ZCT400 IOL in both eyes  by [CONTACT_114778]-based 
AMO Toric IOL Calculat or.  Therefore, t oric IOL calculations are to be performed for all 
subjects  in this study , regardless of whether they choose to be implanted with the 
TECNI S Toric IOLs (Models ZCT300/ZCT400) or the TECNIS non-toric control IOL, 
Model ZCB00.  The investigator will determine the toric lens model that is most 
appropriate for each eye ( based on  associated residual refractive cylinder and axis) 
regardless of the choice of IOL type by [CONTACT_423].  For all subjects, t he toric IOL model 
ABBOTT MEDICAL OPTICS INC. CONFIDENTIAL  
Version 3.0 24  PR/TIOL -202-TPAS  selections chosen by [CONTACT_697586].   
Note: Because lenticular astigmatism in the crystalline lens may influence the 
determination of the amount of astigmatism to be corrected, it is vital that corneal 
astigmatism (keratometry readings) and not  refractive cylinder data be used for toric IOL 
calculations .

eyes  during the initial surgeries or prior to completion of  the 6-month study exam  
(e.g., LRI, AK, OCCI, etc.).  
TECNIS  TORIC IOLS ONLY : 
Using the reference marks made prior to surgery with the subject sitting upright , an axis 
marker is to be used immediately prior to or during surgery to mark  the intended axis of

specified 1- or 6-month  study visits  AND at which an ocular  adverse event is reported 
OR if the subject has a spontaneous report of any of the [ADDRESS_946867] (lines that slant, tilt or separate, flat  surfaces appearing curved, objects 
appearing further away or closer than they actually are, objects appearing to have a 
different size or shape  or physical discomfort related to vision as defined in Section 6.0)  
or of blurred or hazy vision  at [ADDRESS_946868] is seen for a routine (non-study) 3 -month follow -up visit and there are no ocular  
adverse events  or any spontaneous reports of visual distortion(s)  of interest or of blurred 
or hazy vision  at [ADDRESS_946869] commented on a visual distortion as 
listed above or an ocular  adverse event was noted at this visit, this visit would be 
captured on an unscheduled visi t form.    
During the study period, if a  serious or device- related adverse event occurs, per Section 
12.0, details of the event are to be captured on an adverse event CRF and the exam 
details are to be captured on the appropriate visit CRF ( i.e., 1-month, 6-month, 1-year or

Version 3.0 29  PR/TIOL -202-TPAS  (phone calls/emails and/or letters) to locate missing subject s.  It is the responsibility of 
the investigator to provide complete follow -up data to AMO for each subject.   
SUBJECT FOLLOW -UP 
To minimize subject s lost to follow -up, subjects will be provided compensation for their 
time and participation in the study at  the 1- and 6-month postoperative exam s.  
Additionally, sites will be compensated for completion of the 1- and 6-month exams and 
will be provided frequent listings of upcoming 1- and 6-month subject examinations as 
well as follow -up reminder cards to send to the subjects.  It is anticipated that at least 
90% of subjects will be available for the 6 -month study visit  (i.e., no more than a 10% 
lost-to-follow -up rate at 6  months postoperat ively).  
SUBJECT DISCONTINUAT ION 
The investigator should notify AMO prior to discontinuing a subject from the study.  If a 
subject is discontinued from the study, the investigator will, if at all possible, have the subject return for a final study visit.  An E xit CRF is to be completed for each subject 
exiting the study indicating the reason for early termination.  
Subjects should be discontinued from the study only if irretrievably lost  to follow -up or for 
unavoidable reasons such as  subject moved/ unable to locate, subject 
uncooperative/refuses to return, subject died, subject ill/unable to travel, subject 
institutionalized.  The site shall document at least three attempts (phone calls/emails 
and/or letters) to locate lost -to-follow -up subjects.  Patients who would be traveling, 
relocating or otherwise unavailable for postoperative follow -up visits should not be 
chosen for this clinical study.  In the event of unplanned subject relocati on, efforts must 
be made by [CONTACT_697590] -up informat ion (i.e., slit-lamp examination, 
etc.) from the subject’s new physician.  
A subject may be discontinued from the study if complications occur during the first -eye 
surgery  and the planned study lens is not implanted; however, the eye will be followed 
until the resolution of the complication prior to discontinuing the subject from the study.  
If a complication occurs during the second -eye surgery  and the planned study  lens is not 
implanted in the second eye, the subject is to be followed according to the protocol  for 
the first eye ( although data may be analyzed separately ), and the second eye will be 
followed for safety until resolution of the complication.

ABBOTT MEDICAL OPTICS INC. CONFIDENTIAL  
Version 3.0 32  PR/TIOL -202-TPAS  UNANTICIPATED A DVERSE DEVICE EFFECT (UADE)  
An unanticipated adverse device effect is defined as any serious adverse device effect 
on health or safety or any  life-threatening problem or death caused by, or associated 
with, a device, if that effect, problem or death was not previously identified in nature, 
severity or degree of incidence in the  study protocol , risk management file or existing 
product labeling;  or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device 
that relates to the rights, safety or welfare of subjects.   
12.2  ADVERSE EVENT REPO RTING REQUIREMENTS  
All adverse events, regardless of severity and whether or not attributed to the IOLs, are 
to be reported to AMO and recorded on the CRFs supplied.  All s erious adverse events , 
whether anticipated or unanticipated,  and all adverse device e ffects  shall be reported 
using an adverse event case report form and forwarded to AMO.  Adverse events  are 
also to be reported to the reviewing  IRB as per their reporting requirements.  If required, 
adverse events will be reported  to the appropriate regulatory agencies (e.g., FDA, etc.) 
according to all applicable laws and regulations.  Specific instructio ns on notification 
procedures to AMO are included in Appendix E, Adverse Event Reporting.   
In addition to adverse event reporting, Investigators are required to notify AMO of a 
product complaint, device defect or malfunction within a timely manner.  Any d evice 
deficiency that could have led to a serious adverse event without suitable action or 
intervention, or  under less fortunate circ umstances, must be reported to the sponsor 
immediately (no later than 48 hours after detection).   Device deficiencies that could have 
let to a serious adverse event should also be reported to the investigators IRB as per their reporting requirements.  
ADVERSE DEVICE EFFECT  (ADE) 
An adverse device effect  is to be reported to AMO  in a timely manner  by [CONTACT_17258] a 
completed Adverse Event CRF.  The investigator must report the  ADE to the 
investigator’s  IRB as per their reporting requirements.  
SERIOUS ADVERSE EVEN T (SAE)  
In the event of a serious adverse event, which may or may not be related to use of the 
study device, the investigator must notify AMO immediately ( within  48 hours after 
detection)  by [CONTACT_697592] a completed Adverse Event CRF.  The 
ABBOTT MEDICAL OPTICS INC. CONFIDENTIAL  
Version 3.0 33  PR/TIOL -202-TPAS  investigator must report serious adverse events to the investigator’s IRB as per their 
reporting r equirements.  
UNANTICIPATED ADVERS E DEVICE EFFECT (UADE)  
If during the study a serious  adverse event occurs that may reasonably be regarded as 
product related and was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of 
incidence in the study protocol , risk management file, or existing product labeling,  the 
investigator is to report the UADE  to AMO within 48 hours , and to the investigator’s IRB 
as soon as possible (and no later than 10 working days after learning of the event) . 
12.3  ADVERSE EVENT FOLLOW -UP 
For every serious or device- related adverse event , i.e., ADE, SAE and UADE , 
appropriate measures should be undertaken to treat and/or  monitor the subject until 
resolution occurs.  The investigator should keep AMO closely  informed as to the 
outcome, thereby [CONTACT_697593].  An Adverse Event Update  CRF should be completed each time the 
subject returns for follow -up until resolution of the event , i.e., of an ADE, SAE or UADE .  
Addit ionally, the investigator may need to supply to AMO written reports (e.g., from 
outside specialist evaluations) related to these adverse event s until resolution of the 
adverse event.   Any subject who is withdrawn from the study due to an adverse event 
will be followed  until the outcome is determined.  
12.4  RELATIONSHIP TO STUDY  DEVICES 
The investigator should be alert to adverse events that may be related to the study  
devices; in this case, the TECNIS Toric IOLs , Models ZCT300 or ZCT400, and the 
control  TECNIS 1 -pi[INVESTIGATOR_697572], Model ZCB00.  An attempt should be made in 
every case to determine if the event may be device- related .  The following definitions are 
to be used as guidelines  to determine the relationship between the event and the study 
devices or use of the device (implantation procedure) :   
Definitely related:  There is a definite causal relationship between the study 
device or implantation procedure and the adverse event. 
Probably  related:   There is a reasonable possibility of a causal relationship 
between the study device or implantation procedure and 
the adverse event . 
ABBOTT MEDICAL OPTICS INC. CONFIDENTIAL  
Version 3.0 34  PR/TIOL -202-TPAS  Possibly  related:   The adverse event has not been determined to be related 
to the study device or implantation procedure , but no other 
cause has been definitively identified and the device 
cannot  be ruled out as a possible cause. 
Unlikely to be related: The possibility of a potential causal relationship between 
the adverse event and the study device or implantation 
procedure  could exist but the adverse event is most likely 
explained by [CONTACT_697594] .  
Not related:           There is no possibility of a causal relationship between the 
adverse event and the study device or implantation 
procedure .  
If an adverse event is believed to be definitively, probably or possible related to the study 
device, the event will be considered device- related.  The investigator’s determination of 
causal relationship between the adverse event and the IOLs and/the implantation procedure will be recorded on the  Adverse Event case report form.   
13.[ADDRESS_946873]  be reported to AMO and the reviewing IRB as soon as possible, 
but no later than  five working days after the deviation occurred.  A Protocol Deviation 
form is to be completed by [CONTACT_697595], defined as any deviation from the study plan and/or procedures  (e.g., an exception to the 
inclusion/exclusion criteria) .  Unless it is an emergency, i f the investigator desires to 
modify any procedure and/or deviate from the design of the study, he or she must 
contact [CONTACT_203189].  Any modifications (including additional data collection) require  approval 
by [CONTACT_697596].

monitoring, administrative monitoring  and medical oversight . 
16.[ADDRESS_946878], including 
IOLs, and forms can be traced and will allow monitoring of investigator progress and 
compliance.  
LENS ACCOUNTABILITY  
As both study lens types, the TECNIS Toric ZCT300 and ZCT400 IOLs and the  TECNIS 
Model ZCB00, are commercially available, supply records for study lenses will solely be 
the responsibility of the site and managed by [CONTACT_32506].   However, 
documenta tion of the lenses that are implanted in study subjects will be maintained.   
AMO will periodically monitor IOL implant logs to ensure compliance and traceability.  
ABBOTT MEDICAL OPTICS INC. CONFIDENTIAL  
Version 3.0 38  PR/TIOL -202-TPAS  SITE MONITORING  
Prior to performing any study implants, the requirements of the study and reporting 
mechanisms will be explained to each investigator either personally at the investigative  
site or at a group  investigator meeting.  When necessary , a pre-study site qualification 
visit may also be performed to assess the adequacy of the site to perform the study  for 
sites that have not previously worked with AMO or have undergone significant changes, 
or have not been visited in the past year .  At a minimum, a study initiation visit  will be 
performed  at all sites .  
Throughout the duration of the study, site visits to monitor compliance to the protocol will 
be made at each investigative site by [CONTACT_697597].  S ites will be visited at 
least once a year during the study or more often if needed, depending upon site 
enrollment progress, data collection and case report form completion, study exam visit compliance, occurrence of adverse events, etc.  During a routine site visit, AMO will 
review informed consent documents and eligibility, and the dat a on study case report 
forms against subject charts and other source documents to ensure complete and 
accurate reporting.  The subject files will also be reviewed to ensure that all adverse 
events have been reported in a timely manner .  Additionally, AMO  will review documents 
to verify that the minimum items for source documentation have been documented in the subjec t medical charts .  Refer to Section [ADDRESS_946879] data 
records and finalize any outstanding study issues.  
16.3 MEDICAL OVERSIGHT  
The medical monitor will be available throughout the clinical study  to review study results 
and to answer any questions from investigators.  The specific responsibilities of the 
medical monitor are to review and assess any reports of serious or device- related 
adverse events and, if necessary, to discuss these with the reporting investigator(s).  
The medical monitor, as well as any other qualified personnel designated by  [CONTACT_32580] , shall 
also review any reports on the progress of the study.

19.0 TERMINATION OF TH E STUDY 
The clinical study  will be suspended in the event of unexpected high levels of 
complications and/or the occurrence of adverse events that are unexpected in nature 
and/or severity .  The clinical study  will be suspended by [CONTACT_697599]:  
 In the event of severe and alarming adverse events that have not been 
previously anticipated in nature and/or severity.  
ABBOTT MEDICAL OPTICS INC. CONFIDENTIAL  
Version 3.0 40  PR/TIOL -202-TPAS   The Medical Monitor, upon review and evaluation of the clinical data and/or 
adverse event reports, finds the level of single or total complications and/ or 
adverse events unacceptable for continuation of the study . 
 The FDA  or IRBs,  upon review of clinical study  data and/or adverse event 
reports, find the level of complications and/or adverse events unacceptable for continuation of the study . 
 Unacceptable clinical performance of the study  lens(es) (i.e., unacceptable 
incidence, bother or intensity of subjective vi sual distortions , etc.) as deemed by 
[CONTACT_697600]/or the Medical Monitor.  
If the study is suspended, an evaluation of causality will be made to determine the 
relationship to the study lens(es) .  If causality is shown not to be related to the study 
lens(es) , the study may be resumed in accordance with the IRB  and FDA.  The study will 
be terminated if causality is shown to be related to the study lens(es) . 
The investigator or AMO may stop a subject’s participation at any time.  Additionally, 
AMO may stop the study at any time for reasons it determines appropriate.  However, no 
susp ension of the study will be made to disadvantage the study subjects.  Following 
suspension of the study for any reason, all study subjects who have already received at 
least one study lens will continue to be followed through completion of the study visit 
schedule.   
20.[ADDRESS_946881] 6-month data available will be presented for toric and non- toric control  IOL 
groups.  Demographic data (age, sex, gender) will also be presented for both groups .   
Visual distortion findings, adverse events and  medical /lens findings at one year will be 
reported for subjects who experienced a repositioning procedure during the study or for subjects who were reported with severe visual distortions at the [ADDRESS_946882]. The frequency and proportion of subjects reporting one or more of these items as severe will be used to determine the rate of severe visual distortions.   
ABBOTT MEDICAL OPTICS INC. CONFIDENTIAL  
Version 3.0 41  PR/TIOL -202-TPAS  20.1 ANALYSIS POPULATION S 
For the primary endpoint  of the rate of severe visual distortions  (under overall 
circumstances)  and for most visual distortion endpoints, the primary analysis population 
will be subjects bilaterally implanted with either the toric IOLs  or the control lens es.  An 
additional analysis for the rate of severe visual distortions based on the 5 items used for 
the primary endpoint  will be performed that includes all bilateral subjects and those with 
only one eye implanted (i.e. , having a phakic or cataractous fellow eye or having another 
IOL in the fellow eye due to surgical complications prior to lens implantation).  T he rates 
of severe visual distortions  (based on the 5- item evaluation) , will also be stratified by 
[CONTACT_132149] t he lower -cylinder group (those eligible for the ZCT300) and the higher -
cylinder group (those eligible for the ZCT400).  Control subjects will be included in the 
lower - or higher -cylinder group based on the toric lens they would have required if they 
had chosen a toric IOL.  Subjects who are eligible for the ZCT300 in one eye and the 
ZCT400 in the fellow eye will be placed in the ZCT400 group fo r analysis. .  
For other safety endpoints, the primary analysis will consist of the  safety population of all 
eyes implanted with either a toric or control IOL and with available data at the time of 
analysis .  Any operative complications or additional procedures will also be present ed for 
first and second eyes of toric and control  subjects.   Reporting of cumulative 
complications (occurring at any time postoperatively) will include data from all study eyes 
(first and second) implanted.   
20.2 PRIMARY ENDPOINT  ANALYS IS 
The primary endpoint is the rate of severe visual distortions (under overall 
circumstances) as measured by [CONTACT_941]  [ADDRESS_946883] had an earlier visit.  Results for severe 
visual distortions will be evaluated using a non- inferiority approach with a non- inferiority 
margin of 10%.  The upper limit of the 90% confidence interval of the difference in severe visual distort ion rates ( toric minus control ) will be used to evaluate this endpoint.  
The null hypothesis , H
0, is:  pToric – pControl  ≥ 0.10 
The alternate hypothesis , H1, is:  pToric – pControl  < 0.10  
ABBOTT MEDICAL OPTICS INC. CONFIDENTIAL  
Version 3.0 42  PR/TIOL -202-TPAS  With p=proportion reporting severe visual distortions  
A logistic regression analysis for severe visual distortions will be performed with age, 
sex, race , and cylinder subgroup as well as age by [CONTACT_697601].  
To evaluate if toric IOL axis misalignment relative to keratometry are associated with 
severe visual distortions, descriptive statistics for IOL axis misalignment will be reported 
for toric subjects with and without severe visual distortions.  In this study, axis 
misalignment is d efined as the difference between the toric IOL axis marker location 
from the slit -lamp evaluation and the steep meridian from the postoperative keratometry 
measurement.  This measurement is intended to evaluate toric IOL misalignment as a 
possible reason f or severe visual distortions experienced by a subject at a specific 
postoperative time point.  This axis misalignment measurement is not a measure of toric IOL rotational stability, but a measure of toric IOL alignment relative to post -surgical 
keratometry  steep meridian, as it is know n that cataract surgery can induce changes in 
the cornea. 
The frequency  and proportion for the rate of severe visual distortions will also be 
presented for thos e in the low - and high-cylinder subgroups for toric  and control 
subjects.   
20.[ADDRESS_946884] and second eyes of toric and control  subjects.   The severity of all 
serious adverse events and adverse device effects, such as IOL repositioning 
procedures,  through 6  months postoperatively will also be presented.   
ABBOTT MEDICAL OPTICS INC. CONFIDENTIAL  
Version 3.0 43  PR/TIOL -202-TPAS  20.5 ADDITIONAL ANALYSES AND DATA CONVENTIONS  
For categorical data, frequencies and proportions will be computed.  Descriptive 
statistics will include sample size (N), mean, standard deviation (SD), minimum (Min)  
and maximum (Max) as appropriate.   
20.6 SAMPLE SIZE  
A sample size of a minimum of 396 enrolled subjects to achieve bilateral 
implantation of approximately 294 subjects: 169 TECNIS Toric ZCT300 and 
ZCT400 and 125 control subjects is reflective of the number of subjects enrolled 
on the date of this protocol revision (3.0).  
A two -group large- sample normal approximately test of proportions with a one-
sided 0.[ADDRESS_946885] a greater than 90% power to detect a rate of 
severe visual distortions for toric subjects as being 10 percentage points or 
greater than that for control s ubjects . This assumes severe visual distortion rates 
of 1% for both the toric and control subjects. Therefore, the sample size proposed for a minimum of 396 enrolled subjects, assuming a 10% drop out rate 
for a minimum of 152 toric and 112 control subjects available for evaluation at 6

TORIC IOL AXIS  MEASUREMENT AT S LIT LAMP 
The following instructions are to be followed for the measurement of the toric IOL axis  in 
both eyes . 
 
1. Dilate each eye with 2.5% phenylephrine prior to measurement.  Tropi[INVESTIGATOR_31424] (1%)  
may be used in addition, at the Investigator’s discretion.  
2. Allow sufficient time to achieve adequate pupi[INVESTIGATOR_697574]. 
3. At the slit lamp, adjust the slit -lamp beam to be as narrow as possible and align  the 
beam  with the four axis orientation marks (4.5, 5.0, 5.5 and 6.0 mm diameter) on 
one side of the toric IOL.  
a. It is important to align the beam with at least two of the four orientation 
marks for an accurate measurement.  
b. Ensure the subject’s head is oriented vertically in the slit lamp with proper 
head position and alignment of eye with the slit lamp.  
4. Read the angle of the toric IOL axis  markers based on the narrowed slit-lamp 
beam from the angular scale on the slit lamp.  
5. Record this angle in degrees for each eye on the appropriate postoperative case 
report form .

INTRODUCTION 
You are being invited  to participate in a clinical research study sponsored by [CONTACT_697607]. (AMO).  This document describes the study and your role in it.  Your 
doctor has reviewed the study and has agreed to participate as an investigator.  He or she 
will answer  any questions that you have about this study or this consent document.  
Please read this document carefully and ask any questions you have regarding the 
information that it contains.  
PURPOSE OF THIS RESEARCH STUDY  
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the rate of visual distortions and ongoing safety of 
the TECNIS Toric  intraocular lenses (IOLs), Models ZCT300 and ZCT400.  You have 
been invited to participate in this research study because you have a certain level of astigmatism and are scheduled to undergo cataract surgery with IOL implantation in both 
of your eyes.  
Cataracts occur when the natural lens of the eye becomes cloudy and eventually can 
interfere with vision.  Cataract surgery involves the removal of the clouded lens by a surgical technique called phacoemulsification, and this must be performed before an IOL 
can be placed in your eye.  The IOLs will be implanted into your eyes to help restore vision 
and are intended to remain in your eyes permanently; however, the IOLs can be surgically 
repositioned, replaced or removed if necessary.  Standard or “monofocal , non- toric” IOLs 
provide predominantly far vision only and do not correct astigmatism. 
Astigmatism is a condition where the cornea (front surface) of the eye is not curved 
uniformly like a sphere, but is shaped more like a football.  With astigmatism, the light rays 
passing through the cornea do not focus on a single point of the retina.  This may cause 
objects both near and far away to appear blurred and even broadened or elongated.   An 
IOL designed to reduce astigmatism is called a “toric” IOL.   
In this study, you will have the option to choose which type of lens you would like to be 
implanted with in both of your eyes:  either toric  IOLs or standard IOL s.  Both types of 
ABBOTT MEDICAL OPTICS INC. CONFIDENTIAL  
SAMPLE ONLY - NOT TO BE USED FOR SUBJECT ENROLLMENT  
Version 3.0  60 PR/TIOL -202-TPAS  IOLs in this study have been approved by [CONTACT_697608], the same 1-pi[INVESTIGATOR_697577].  The only difference between the toric lenses and 
the standard lens is the toric surface to correct for astigmatism.  The toric  IOLs in this 
study are designed for eyes with higher amounts of astigmatism and are called the 
TECNIS Toric IOLs, M odels ZCT300 and ZCT400.  If you choose to be implanted with the 
toric lenses, t he amount of astigmatism you have in your eyes will determine which toric 
IOL model is best for each of your eyes.  The standard IOL in this study is called the 
TECNIS 1 -pi[INVESTIGATOR_203156], Model ZCB00.  The table below compares the three lenses in this 
study :

Approximately 396 enrolled and 294 treated  from up to 80 investigative  sites in the [LOCATION_003] to 
participate in this study.  If you qualify for the study , you will be able to choose which lens 
type you prefer (“toric” or “standard”) and your Study Doctor will help you decide.   
The TECNIS Tor ic IOLs were previously studied for safety and effectiveness in a clinical 
study of [ADDRESS_946898]: 
• be at least 22 years old  
• have cataracts in both eyes  
• have a certain degree of astigmatism in both eyes  
• sign this written informed consent  
• be willing and able to comply with examination procedures  
• understand, read and write English to complete informed consent and 
questionnaires 
• be available for study follow -up visits  
EXCLUSION CRITERIA  
You will not be eligible to participate in the study if:  
• you are currently participating in any other clinical study or have participated in a 
clinical study during the last [ADDRESS_946899] ENROLLMENT  
Version 3.0  61 PR/TIOL -202-TPAS  • you have a certain disease/illness such as poorly -controlled diabetes  
• you have certain ocular conditions such as uncontrolled glaucoma  
• you are taking medication that may affect your vision 
• you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant during the study, or are breastfeeding 
Both of your eyes must qualify  to be eligible to participate in this study.  Your Study Doctor 
will inform you if you do not meet the criteria to participate in this study.  
DURATION O F PARTICIPATION  
The duration of participation is approximately 6 months  with a minimum of two study visit s 
after the surgeries .  If you experience a secondary surgical procedure to reposition your 
IOL(s)  or have certain visual distortions you will need to return at 1 year as well.  Your 
personal doctor will be informed of your participation in this study only with your 
permission.  
STUDY PROCEDURES  
You will be screened preoperatively by [CONTACT_697609] a good 
candidate for this study.  If you are enrolled and qualify, you will be able to choose which 
lens type you prefer ( the TECNIS Toric IOLs or the TECNIS standard IOL ).  If you choose 
to be implanted with toric IOLs, your doctor will determine which lens model (ZCT300 or ZCT400) will be best for each of your eyes.  
During surgeries, the  IOLs will be folded and inserted into your eyes, following routine 
cataract extraction.  Your second eye will undergo surgery within approximately [ADDRESS_946900] a minimum of 2 postoperative study visit s through  approximately 6 months 
following the surgery for your second eye.  If you experience an ocular adverse event prior 
to the 6 -month visit, you will be asked to return for evaluation(s) by [CONTACT_6814].  In 
certain cases, y ou may also be asked to return for a visit at 1 year if you experience a 
secondary surgical procedure to reposition your IOL(s)  or have certain visual distortions.   
The study visits are outlined in the table below:

Each study visit will consist of routine procedures that are commonly performed during 
preoperative, operative and postoperative visits for this type of surgery.  Your doctor may 
also ask you to return for additional study or routine follow -up visits at his or her discretion.  
Prior to surgery and at  the 6-month visit, you will be asked to complete a questionnaire 
related to the occurrence of any visual distortions .  If you experience certain visual 
ABBOTT MEDICAL OPTICS INC. CONFIDENTIAL  
SAMPLE ONLY - NOT TO BE USED FOR SUBJECT ENROLLMENT  
Version 3.0  62 PR/TIOL -202-TPAS  distortions  or have had a secondary surgical procedure to reposition your IOL(s) , you will 
be asked to return at 1 year to complete the questionnaire again.   
If you experience significant complications during the study in either of your eyes, 
regardless of which lens type you choose, the lens(es) may  be surgically removed.  In this 
case, you will be asked to return for routine follow -up exams as needed.  
Please understand that missing study exams can have a negative effect on the integrity 
and reliability of the study and may reduce the scientific value of your contributions to the study.  You are therefore encouraged not to miss any scheduled visits.  
During the course of the study, no additional surgical procedures to enhance your vision (such as LASIK  or limbal relaxing incisions ) are t o be performed on your eyes after IOL 
implantation.  If you require correction for your vision, you will be asked to wear glasses or 
contact [CONTACT_269006].   A spectacle and/or contact [CONTACT_697610] 1- month visit.  
Your Study Doctor or a member of the study staff will answer any questions you may have about the surgery, follow- up tests and procedures.   
REASONABLY FORESEEABLE RISKS OR DISCOMFORT TO THE PATIENT 
GENERAL CATARACT SURGERY AND IOL IMPLANTATI ON RISKS  
Regardless of which IOL type you receive, there are risks and possible complications for 
the basic procedure of cataract surgery and IOL implantation.  Some complications of this 
surgery in general, although rare, may include:  
• worsening of vision  
• hemorrhage (bleeding)  
• loss of corneal clarity  
• inflammation  
• infections  
• pupil size or shape changes  
• retinal detachment  
• glaucoma  
• swelling in the back of the eye  
• secondary surgical procedure to reposition, remove or replace the IOL(s)  
 
These complications may occur whether or not an IOL is implanted and may result in poor vision, total loss of vision, or loss of the eye.  Additionally, there may be other 
unforeseeable risks that may also be associated with cataract surgery and implantation of 
an IOL.    
TORIC IOL RISKS: Toric IOLs are primarily intended to provide far vision, and you will 
most likely need to wear glasses for near vision.  If the toric  IOLs are not placed in your 
eyes in the correct position or rotate at a later time, you may possibly experience visual 
distortions  such as:  
• objects appearing distorted in shape  
• objects appearing tilted  
• flat surfaces appearing curved 
• queasiness related to your vision 
ABBOTT MEDICAL OPTICS INC. CONFIDENTIAL  
SAMPLE ONLY - NOT TO BE USED FOR SUBJECT ENROLLMENT  
Version 3.0  63 PR/TIOL -202-TPAS  Additionally, you may  need to undergo a second surgical procedure to reposition the toric 
IOL if it is no longer in the correct position.   
STANDARD IOL RISKS:  Standard (m onofocal ) IOLs are primarily intended to provide far 
vision, and you will most likely need to wear glasses  for near vision.  The standard 
monofocal IOL is not designed to correct astigmatism.  If you choose to receive this IOL, 
you may need to wear spectacles (glasses) for the duration of the study to correct your 
astigmatism.  Following study completion, contacts may be worn or you may undergo a surgical procedure such as a Limbal Relaxing Incision (LRI) to correct the astigmatism if 
needed.  Additionally, some patients report optical visual symptoms with monofocal IOLs 
as well.  
TECNIS ASPHERIC SURF ACE RISKS:   Both the TECNIS monofocal and TECNIS Toric 
IOLs have the TECNIS aspheric surface designed to improve vision in low-light conditions.  
However, there is a possibility you may not experience improved vision in low -light 
conditions  as the surface  was designed for the “average” eye and may not improve vision 
for all people and also depends on achieving complete correction postoperatively .  
 
MEDICAL BENEFITS  
You may or may not receive any direct medical benefit from being in this study.  Your  
condition may get better, it may get worse, or it may stay the same.  The information that is obtained during this study may be useful scientifically and thus be helpful to others 
requiring the same treatment  
 
ALTERNATIVE TREATMENTS  
You understand that you may decide not to have a cataract operation at all.  However, if 
you decide to participate in this study , you understand that there are alternative toric  IOLs 
available for restoring useful vision and reducing astigmatism.  Additionally, other 
treatments and procedures to reduce astigmatism are available to you such as spectacles 
(glasses), contact [CONTACT_13276], and surgical procedures such as LRI and LASIK.  You should 
discuss the potential risks and benefits of the additional treatments and procedures 
available to you with your Study Doctor.

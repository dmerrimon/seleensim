3. Abstract:  
In this Phase II SBIR project we will enhance a wireless WiFi -based insole that was designed and 
successfully tested and evaluated during a Phase I trial with elderly persons with dementia and their 
caregivers, and then investigate its efficacy in reducing  caregiver activity and burden, and improving 
caregiver quality of life.  An estimated 5.4 million Americans had Alzheimer’s disease in 2016 and a 50% 
increase in this number is expected by 2030. The majority of these patients (70%) will live at home where 
they receive 75% of their care from informal, unpaid caregivers, such as family members, friends, and 
neighbors. These caregivers provide valuable services, often at great economic and psychological cost to 
themselves. In 2015, over [ADDRESS_1197444] been provided by [CONTACT_46431] 
15 million caregivers. Around 15% of them quit their job or reduced their hours to provide this care. This 
translated to nearly $[ADDRESS_1197445] be worn as 
wristbands or belt mounts. There exists an unmet need to support caregivers by [CONTACT_859281] a 
comprehensive localization solution of the patient relative to the caregiver that works both indoors and 
outdoors with little to no additional infrastructure required.   
 
ASTER Labs’ device, called Activlink, is a patient localization solution opt imized to assist monitoring by 
[CONTACT_859282]. The goal is to 
increase quality of life for caregivers by [CONTACT_1541] a highly -accurate localization of a patient’s position, 
combined with real-time alerts of a patient’s wandering movements. Perpetual safety concerns and the 
demands of constantly monitoring their patient result in caregiver’s often reported reduced abilities to 
function in normal daily activities. Activlink provides on -deman d access to real -time location 
visualization within a home or public building, both while in relatively close proximity to the patient and 
remotely, for remotely -located family members or secondary caregivers wishing to monitor the patient’s 
location. The innovative concept design for this system provides continuous localization capabilities, so 
that the quality of life for both patient and caregiver may be enhanced by [CONTACT_859283] a home or in large indoor spaces like malls, airports, a nd medical centers. In this project, 
ASTER Labs will use WiFi and inertial sensor dead reckoning technologies to create a highly unique, 
accurate, and practical indoor localization solution. This Phase II SBIR will evaluate the efficacy of the 
WiFi -based i nsole to provide caregivers with augmented patient awareness, helpi[INVESTIGATOR_859267]. 
Evaluation will be done using semi -structured interviews and p articipant observation data collected on 
persons with moderate  to mild  dementia, their family caregivers, and professional care providers via an 
embedded randomized controlled evaluation.  
 
4. Background:  
Recent research indicates longer life expectancy for America’s seniors than at any prior time, with [ADDRESS_1197446] two additional decades. In the next 25 years, the [LOCATION_002]’ elderly 
population expects to see an 80 percent growth  [1]. Coupling these projections with the advance of the 
baby [CONTACT_582517] , the roughly [ADDRESS_1197447] seniors, this population increase has meant a heightened prevalence of agi ng-
associated conditions and diseases. In 2016, 14% of all American seniors over [ADDRESS_1197448] 5.5 million people [2 ]. In the oldest old , those seniors over age 90, 
that occurrence spi[INVESTIGATOR_859268] 37.4% [3 ]. Lacking methods  to prevent, cure, or slow the progression of 
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and similar variations of the syndrome, one in every three seniors is expected 
to die with some form of dementia [4]. In the coming four decades, the number of functionally dependent 
Americans with AD, predicted to be around three times the current number, may overwhelm the eldercare 
system and significantly tax the availability o f quality long -term healthcare. AD, the most common form 
of dementia, characteristically worsens significantl y through its progression. The early stages involve 
symptoms of forgetfulness, with patients unable to recall familiar peo ple’s names or recent events [5] -[8]. 
In its middle stages, disorientation, memory loss, and confusion tend to see a marked increase, so that 
recalling appointments, recognizing family members, and remembering important tasks like taking 
medication  becomes much more difficult [5] -[8]. It is often at these stages that patients will experience 
heightened anxiety associated with the cogniti ve loss that leads to personality changes, loss of sense of 
self, and frustrations with the newly imposed lack of independence [9 ]. Caregiver’s quality of life 
therefore is distinctly impacted by a patient’s behavioral changes like depression, fear, frustr ation, and 
grief [10 ]. 
 
In the absence of a cure, dementia patients and caregivers prioritize quality of life  as their most valued 
outcome [11 ]. Safety concerns impact quality of life and are a primary reason for dementia p atients’ 
relocation from home [12 ]. Significant economic cost is associated with the treatment and care of AD 
patients, who can expect to pay near triple the cost for health care and long -term care [3],[13 ]. Recent 
estimates indicate informal, unpaid caregivers, such as family members, fri ends and neighbors, provide 
three -quarters of the care for patients suffering from dementia, 70% of whom are cared for at home full or 
part time [15],[16]. New studies show that informal in -home patient monitoring has the potential to 
reduce frequency of h ospi[INVESTIGATOR_859269] [17 ], [18]. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_859270], the economic cost has become overwhelming. In [ADDRESS_1197449] 
$221.3 billion in unpaid caregiving in the [LOCATION_002] [19],[1]. Accompanying the financial burden, 
informal caregivers cite lost work hours, leaves of absence, and career abandonment as common work -
related issues associated with the conflict between caregiving and career [20]. In more serious cases, 
psychological effects and shortened lifespan have been attributed to the demands of careg iving 
[15],[16 ],[20]. Monitoring dementia patients typi[INVESTIGATOR_859271], making 
feelings of isolation common [21]–[23]. Inabilities to interact in normal social settings and activities and 
difficulty caring for non -mobile  dementia patients add to the list of stress factors associated with 
caregiving [24],[25].  
 
While progression of each patient’s dementia varies, one of the most common and burdensome 
similarities in behavior  is wandering , or dementia elopement  [14],[ 25]. It is estimated that 60% of AD 
patients exhibit this behavior and are at risk of disorienta tion and associated injuries [26],[27 ]. Studies 
show that half of all wanderers lost for 24 hours or more will be inj ured or die [ 28],[29 ]. The 
advancement of AD tends to increase the disorientation in time and space, increasing the probability of 
elopement behavior [ 2],[30 ],[31]. A system providing caregivers the ability to localize a wandering 
patient would reduce the emotional burdens of caregiving and enhance the safety of dementia patients. 
This localiza tion tool, which automates the monitoring process and provides rapid alerts when a patient’s 
movement indicates undesired wandering, holds significant potential. The tool would renew caregiver’s 
abilities to function in normal daily activities and increase  economic freedom from the great cost 
associated with caring for a patient or loved one suffering from dementia.  
 
 
 
 
5. Specific aim s: 
The efficacy of the Activlink system offering localization information to improve caregiver will be 
evaluated in two stud ies. Study 2a will use the insole system with dementia patients residing in skilled or 
memory care. Data regarding caregiving activity will be collected from their paid professional care 
providers. Study 2b will use participant localization data collected on [ADDRESS_1197450] burden of 
continuous oversight of their person in care.  
 
6. Research plan:  
The proposed study is the second phase of a larger, multi -phase study: Accurate WiFi -Based Localizati on 
of Dementia Patients For Caregiver Support. The first phase involved assessing the feasibility and utility 
of the Activlink insole . The specific aims of the first phase were to define the architecture and build a 
prototype Activlink insole, develop the software solution of the WiFi -based localization, and evaluate the 
feasibility of using the insole and associated application for providing caregivers a method to monitor the 
location of their demented patient (see page 15 of 57 of the NIH Grant Proposal).  Phase I goal was fully 
accomplished and feasibility was successfully shown via both technical evaluation of the insole prototype 
system as well as positive responses in the Phase I focus study evaluation (see page [ADDRESS_1197451] aim targets the creation of 
a market -ready insole sensory system with cross -platform mobile application. The second aim of Phase II 
relates specifically to the purpose of the proposed study. This study which encompasses a im two of Phase 
II, focuses on evaluating the efficacy of the Activlink system by [CONTACT_859284]. Specifically, this study (Phase II, aim 2) 
will be completed usi ng two separate studies, Studies 2a and 2b. Study 2a will use the insole system with 
dementia patients residing in skilled or memory care. Data regarding caregiving activity will be collected 
from their paid professional care providers. Study 2b will use p articipant localization data collected on [ADDRESS_1197452] a total of 4 cohorts (monitored then unmonitored months 13 -18, 
unmonitored then monitored months 13 -18, monitored then unmonitored months 19 -24, unmonitored then 
monitored months 19 -24). For Study 2b, caregivers will be mailed questionnaires related to caregiver 
activities, caregiver burden, and quality of life on a weekly basis throughout the six month spa n of the 
study.  
 
Settings and Targeted Population  
Ambulatory dementia patients will wear the localization device in these studies. However, the study 
participants actually providing data in these studies will be paid and unpaid caregivers. Study 2a will b e 
conducted in the memory and skilled care units at Oak Hammock Senior Living Center in Gainesville, 
FL. Five ambulatory patients with moderate dementia (Mini -mental State Exam (MMSE) scores of 10 -
18) in each setting (memory/ski lled) will be identified and  with consent of their legal pro xies included in 
their study. Participants in Study 2a will include 10 persons with moderate dementia and their six paid 
caregivers at Oak Hammock Senior Living Center. These professional caregivers preside over multiple 
patients at one time, so only six paid caregivers are needed for these 10 patients. Separate day and 
evening shift assigned primary caregivers (typi[INVESTIGATOR_859272]) will be provided the 
smartphone tool used for monitoring location. Study 2b  will be conducted with community dwelling 
dementia patients with mild dementia (MMSE 19 -25). Participants in Study 2b will include [ADDRESS_1197453] with 
the patients. Cohabitation will not be required but will be recorded will caregiver relationship (spouse, 
adult child, other family, friend) as covariates.  Presumed etiology of the dementia will be recorded but 
will not be a selection factor (Alzheimer’s, vascular dementia, Lewy body dementia) .

• History of Major Mental Illnes s for patient or caregiver  
 
Vulnerable Population  
Pregnant women, decisionally impaired individuals, and UF/One[LOCATION_012]  Institution Students may be 
vulnerable populations that may be included in this study  but not purposely targeted . In fact , it is unlikely 
that our subjects will be pregnant because of the age the majority of our participants will be. Pregnant 
woman are no t excluded from the study but are unlikely to be p articipants as those females of 
childbearing age generally fall outside the range of the typi[INVESTIGATOR_859273] a person with dementia 
(PWD). However, it is important to include pregnant women in this pro ject because we would be losing 
family members of PWD if we exclude women under the age of 62. Nonetheless, the study will use no 
drugs or devices that are potentially harmful to the fetus. These individuals will be fully disclosed and 
will understand they  can refrain from participating in the study at any time. They will also be told that no 
drugs or devices are used in the study that could be harmful to the fetus.  
As for de cisionally impaired individuals, t he primary goal of this study is to provide a pra ctical solution 
of monitoring the location of individuals with dementia to reduce caregiver stress and burden and 
improve quality of life. Early stage dementia symptoms include forgetfulness, patients unable to recall 
familiar people’s names or recent even ts. These individuals can often function independently or with 
minor assistance from others.  Monitoring location in these individuals who continue to reside in 
community could be extremely advantageous to the individual themselves and to their possible ca regiver 
to avoid them getting lost in unfamiliar environments and also to assure they are following routines. In 
the moderate stages of dementia, marked increases occur in disorientation, memory loss, and confusion 
exaggerating the need for monitoring. We believe these individuals, along with their caregivers, would 
significantly benefit in location monitoring as problems with disorientation become more prevalent. All 
individuals will dementia must have a legal proxy that can provide consent to support the patients assent. 
Both patients with dementia and their caregivers will be informed that their participation in the study is 
entirely voluntary, and though no harm is expected from their participation, they can stop participating at 
any point of the study. Furthermore, both patients and caregivers will be told that their choice of whether 
or not to participate will not affect their clinical care.  
 
It is important that we include UF/Shands/VA/One[LOCATION_012] Institution Staff in the study because these 
individual s could potentially be caregivers of people with dementia. These individuals will be fully 
disclosed and will understand they can refrain from participating in the study at any time. They will also 
be told that no drugs or devices are used in the study tha t could elicit harm. They will also be told that 
their participation in the study will remain confidential and not affect their position as 
UF/Shands/VA/One[LOCATION_012] staff.    
 
Measures  and Devices Proposed  
Dementia patients will wear the provided insole ins erted into their own shoes. The insole will have a 
small electronic sensor that measures acceleration, foot force, and/or orientation. The subject will then 
walk for a series trials to determine the wearability while in motion. Data will be transmitted sec urely 
from the sensor system to the data collection device, a laptop or desktop computer. Once collected, the 
data file will be securely stored. Caregivers will complete paper records of caregiver activity, burden, and 
quality of life.  
 
Location Validation  Measures in Study A.  For one -week prior to the formal efficacy trial, the 
technology will be deployed to all 10 participants.  Once per shift at a randomly generated time, the paid 
caregivers a notification (a buzz on the smartphone) and asked to respond 1) location visually verified to 
be correct 2) location visually verified as incorrect or 3) unable to provide verification at that time due to 
other responsibilities.  In the case of the last response, the system will auto generate  another noti fication 
latter in that shift.  Caregivers will be asked to verify location as either correct or incorrect at least one 
time per shift. Ten patients tracked at least twice per day over 7 days will provide 140 data points to 
assess the accuracy of the syste m at tracking patient location.   An accuracy of less than 95% will result in 
our delaying the efficacy study until technical improvements can improve the accuracy of the deployed 
system.  
Primary Efficacy Outcome . Primary outcome measure in both studies wi ll be the Caregiver Activ ity 
Survey (Davis, et al., 1997 ). This well validated scale requires caregivers to report on amount of time 
spent caregiving for a particular patient.  It has high test -retest reliability (.88) and documents an increase 
in time spe nt in supervision as MMSE declines overtime (Marin et al., 2000).  Caregivers will be asked to 
complete this instrument once every two weeks.  
Secondary Efficacy Outcomes  in Study b.  Caregivers in study b will also complete the short -form of 
the Za rit Car egiver Bur den scale [32 ] and  the AD Quality of Life Scale [ 33]. Both scales are reliable, well 
validated, and the most widely used measu res of careburden and AD -QoL.  
 
 
Recruiting Procedure  
[CONTACT_84135] will identify persons from his clinical practice as well  as those referred by [CONTACT_859286]. Flyers will may be given to other physicians as well as 
psychologists at the University of [LOCATION_012]. If a psychologist or a clinician has a patient that appear eligible 
for the study, they may  provide thei r patients with a study flyer. Approved flyers will may also be posted 
at the abovementioned sites (UF Health Clinics) such as the Memory Disorder Clinics, behavioral 
neurology and neuropsychology practices at the University of [LOCATION_012], as well as at Oak Hammock. 
Potential participants and their partners may contact [CONTACT_859287]. For participants in phase one, an appointment will be set up to gather informed consent with 
participant  and legal proxy at Oak Hammock. If informed consent is obtained, screening will follow. For 
participants in the second phase, a brief screening will take place over the phone, followed by [CONTACT_859288], at the University of [LOCATION_012] or, if more convenient 
for the participant, at the participants’ home. Once informed consent is obtained, an additional screener of 
dementia will then follow.  
 
We may table at community events (e.g. Vitality Fair at Oak Hammock), where flyers would be provided 
and sub -investigators would be present, tabling, to provide a brief summary of the study. In these 
instances, flyers will be handed out to individuals. Potential participants would get any questions 
answered and see and hear about the inclusion/exclusion criteria. If potential participants show interest, 
they will be told to call the number on the flyer to set an appointment to obtain consent. During this phone 
call, a brief screener will take place. After consent is obtained in person, an additional screening 
(administration of the MMSE) would occur after informed consent is obtained.  Graduate assistants will 
be obtaining consent, and will emphasize both the participant's option to not participate as well as their 
ability to withdraw at any time with no  consequences or repercussions.  
 
Data Safety Monitoring Board  
As the proposed project will pose minimal risks to study participants the Principal Investigator (PI), [CONTACT_91754], will serve as the primary monitoring entity of this study. The proposed study involves n o invasive 
procedures and there will be no physical risks to study participants. The consideration of need is 
potentially stressful, and thus there are possible psychological risks for the caregiver a relative with 
dementia. However, potential participants  with a history of serious mental illness (i.e., any major 
psychiatric disorder) will not be included in the study and since the research team has considerable 
experience providing psychosocial support to dementia caregivers on various research protocols, serious 
psychological risks are unlikely to occur. The potential social or legal risks for the participants relate only 
to possible violations of confidentiality. Additional monitoring support will be provided by [CONTACT_818862] (ISM),  Shelli e-Anne Levy.  
 
Protection of Privacy:  
All information obtained from the participants will remain strictly confidential and  will not be released 
except at the express written request of the study participant. All electronic data will be maintained on [CONTACT_91754]’s office computer and the Department of Clinical and Health Psychology shared pr oject folder. Per 
University of [LOCATION_012], all data on [CONTACT_84135]’s computer and the research staff’s computers a re protected 
by [CONTACT_859289]. Smith or  the research team. The data will be maintained on [CONTACT_91754]’s research team’ s computers and on the Department of Clinical and Health Psychology secure 
project folder for approximately 2-3 years, which is the duration anticipated it will take to disseminat e 
any and all research papers or presentations from these data. Similarly, paper forms of the data will be 
located i n a locked file cabinet in room within the Department of Clinical and Health Psychology only 
accessible to the  research team. Unless the dat a are being filed or accessed, these cabinets will remain 
locked.   
 
Insole localization data is recorded and packaged to be sent to a remote file server. Each data set will be 
time-tagged, however, will only be identified by [CONTACT_859290]. 
No individual person data will be connected or associated with this data. File servers will likely be 
Google Firebase or Amazon Web Services, and data will be encrypted and secured so that no external 
access is provided to  any individual data. Remote persons selected to view a patient’s location will use 
password protection and only persons associated with that patient such as caregivers or physicians will be 
provided login information. ASTER Labs personnel will have access  to the stored location only data, but 
not the relationship of the data to a specific individual participant. University of [LOCATION_012] will maintain the 
relationship of unique data identifiers per individual.  
 
Subjects will be assigned a study number that wil l be used in lieu o f any identifying information. All 
other paper copi[INVESTIGATOR_859274] a locked file cabinet with access given 
only to those conducting the study. To minimize potential breach of confidentiality, data wil l be identified 
by [CONTACT_859291] a filing system completely separate from any identifying information about the 
subjects. All data obtained in this study will remain confidential. The identification key to each research 
ID will be maintained under l ock and key at each participating site. Database information will be 
password protected, and hardcopi[INVESTIGATOR_859275] a locked cabinet at University 
of [LOCATION_012]. Onl y the PI [INVESTIGATOR_859276] e access to patient id entities. Furthermore, the 
collection of sensitive information about subjects is limited to the amount necessary to achieve the aims 
of the research, so that no unneeded sensitive information is being collected.  
 
7. Possible Discomforts and Risks:  
This st udy focuses on the utility of a technology that tracks the location of a person with dementia. The 
first primary risk is a loss of privacy for the person with dementia. The technology will track throughout 
the environment, so it will be possible to infer w hen he or she uses t he bathroom, goes to bed, etc. The 
second primary risk could be a false sense of security for the caregiver about the whereabouts of the 
patient.  For example if the insole is not operating correctly or is not worn, the caregiver may be lieve the 
person with dementia is in a safe location when they are not.   
Participation in this study is considered to be of minimal risk compared to the standard unmonitored 
living arrangement of the persons with dementia and their caregivers. Nevertheless , we will engage in 
thorough safety monitoring.  Furthermore, [CONTACT_84135] has considerable experience working with older 
adults and is equipped to handle all emergencies. Given our extensive research on dementia caregiving 
populations as well as the general l iterature, it is unlikely care partners or persons with dementia will be 
under the age of 30; therefore, we do not anticipate requiring additional consent mechanisms or 
protections of risk for individuals under the age of 21.  All interviews will be con ducted by [CONTACT_40420]. 
Smith or a research assistant . These interviews will be in -person. Staff and procedures for handling 
medical emergencies are in place at Oak Hammock. Medical emergencies occurring for community 
dwelling residents will be addressed using t he standard 911 system.  
 
8. Possible Benefits:  
We believe that participation in the Activlink evaluation will y ield benefits for participants. The expected 
benefits for participants are the feeling one might experience knowing they are helpi[INVESTIGATOR_859277]. Utilization of the Activlink insole and mobile 
application will provide caregivers of PWD with greater opportunities to continue with their daily 
activities with reduced concern that they  must directly and continuously view their PWD, as the new 
device can assist them by [CONTACT_859292].  
This aiding and supporting the advancement of new technology to further support caregiver operation i s 
sufficient for the subjects to understand the risks associated with this study.  
 
Studies that evaluate the efficacy of assistive technologies to enhan ce living with dementia are 
underdeveloped. The proposed project aims to fill this scientific and clinical gap by [CONTACT_56620] a novel, 
insole sensor system with its associated mobile application that will allow caregivers of PWD to more 
fully engage in necessary activities other than constant monitoring. We anticipate that Activlink will offer 
robust su pport for care partners, professional staff, and families of PWD in various communities.  
9. Conflict of Interest  
Prior to the onset of the study the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_859278]. One method 
of recruitment is to approach ind ividuals seen as clinical patients about research. Care will not continue to 
be provided during or after the study. No other conflict of interest are present.

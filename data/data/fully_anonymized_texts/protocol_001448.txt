Title of study:  An Open -Label, [ADDRESS_542472] and a Proton Pump Inhibitor on the Single Dose Pharmacokinetics of LOXO-292 in 
Healthy Adult Subjects  
Objectives:  
The objectives of this study are:  
Primary: 
• To assess the effect of multiple do ses of an H2 antagonist (ranitidine) administered with a 
single dose of LOXO -292 on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of LOXO-292 under fasted 
conditions in healthy adult subjects . 
• To assess the effect of multiple doses of a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) (omeprazole) 
administered with a single dose of LOXO-292 on t he PK of LOXO-292 given with a 
low-fat meal  in healthy adult subjects. 
Secondary: 
• To determine the safety and tolerability of a single dose of LOXO-[ADDRESS_542473] (ranitidine) under fasted conditions, 
and in combination with a PPI (omeprazole) given with a low-fat meal in healthy adult 
subjects.  
Study design:  
This is an open label, 3- period, fixed sequence study. 
 
In Period 1, a single oral dose of LO XO-[ADDRESS_542474] 
of 10 hours prior to and 4 hours after the LOXO-292 dose. Blood samples for LOXO -292 PK 
analysis will be taken for 168 hours after the LOXO-292 dose on Day 1. 
 In Period 2, multiple oral doses of ranitidine will be administered twice daily from Day 8 until 
Day 18 inclusively (for a total of 11 consecutive days) and administered with a single oral dose of 
LOXO-[ADDRESS_542475] of 10 hours prior to and 4 hours after the LOXO-292 dose. On Day 12, ranitidine will be administered 2 hours (± 10 minutes) after the 
LOXO-292 dose. On Days 8 - 11 and 13 - 18, the morning dose of ranitidine will be administered 
(with breakfast) approximately 2 hours (± 1 hour) after the planned or actual time of the Day 12 
LOXO- 292 dose and the evening dose of ranitidine will  be administered (with a light meal/snack) 
approximately 10 hours (±  1 hour) prior to the planned or actual time of the Day 12 LOXO-292 
dose. Blood samples for LOXO -292 PK analysis will be taken for 168 hours after the LOXO -292 
dose on Day 12.  
 
In Period 3, multiple oral doses of omeprazole will be administered once daily from Day 19 until 
Day 29 inclusively (for a total of 11 consecutive days) and administered with a single oral dose of 
LOXO-[ADDRESS_542476] of 2 hours prior  to and 1 hour after the omeprazole dose (Note: 
omeprazole will be administered at approximately  the actual time of the Day 12 LOXO-292 
dosing). Blood samples for LOXO-292 PK analysis will be taken for 168 hours after the 
LOXO -292 dose on Day 23.

To assess their eligibility to enter the study, pot ential subjects will be screened within 28 days 
(Days -29 to - 2) and be admitted to the Clinical Research Unit (CRU) on Day -1 (Check-in). 
Replacement subjects may be enrolled only if deemed necessary by [CONTACT_1034].  
 Subjects will be confined at the CRU from the time of Check- in (Day  -1) until End of Treatment 
(EOT ) on Day 30 upon completion of all PK and safety assessments or Early Termination ( ET) if 
the subject discontinues. A follow-up phone call will occur for all subjects who received at least 
1 dose of study drug (including subjects who are terminate d study early) 7 days (± 2 days) after 
EOT or ET . 
 
In this study, physical examinations (PEs), 12- lead electrocardiograms (ECGs), vital signs, How Do 
You Feel? inquiries, clinical chemistry panel, coagul ation parameters, complete blood count (CBC) , 
and urinalysis (UA;  Appendix 2 ) and concomitant medication recording will be performed at 
Screening and at specified times during the study (for specific timepoints and det ails on each study 
variable, refer to  Appendix 4). Adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) will be 
collected beginning at informed consent. AEs will be reported throughout the study (ie, from signing of the Informed Consent Form [ICF] until End of Study [EOS], or until ET if the subject 
discontinues from the study and does not complete a follow -up phone call ), either as subject 
medical history (if the event is reported as beginning prior to signing of the ICF or if the event 
occurs prior to study drug administration on Day 1 and is assessed as not related to study 
procedures by [CONTACT_737] [or designee] ) or as AEs (if the event occurs after signing of the ICF 
but prior to study drug administration on D ay 1 and is assessed as related to study procedures by [CONTACT_3786] [or designee], or if the event occurs after study drug administration on Day  1 through 
EOT or ET regardless of relationship to study drug). From EOT or ET through EOS, only AEs 
assessed as related to study drug by [CONTACT_737] (or designee) are to be reported. All SAEs that 
develop from the time of ICF signing until EOS (or ET, if the subject discontinues from the study and does not complete a follow-up phone call ) are to be reported. 
 
Study Completion is defined as the time of the last subject’s follow -up phone call.  
Number of subjects:  
Twenty healthy, adult, male and female subjects (women of nonchildbearing potential only) are 
considered sufficient to assess the effect of multiple doses of an H2 antagonist (under fasted 
conditions) or a PPI (given with a low- fat meal) on the PK of LOXO -292. 
 Every attempt will be made to enroll at least 3 subjects of each sex in the study.  
 
Subjects who withdraw or drop out of the study may be rep laced if deemed necessary by [CONTACT_429].  
Diagnosis and main criteria for inclusion:  
Male subjects and female subjects of nonchildbearing potential, between 18 and 55 years of age, 
inclusive, at Screening, and within body mass index (BMI) range 18.5 to 32.0 kg/m2, inclusive. 
Subjects will be in good general health, based on medical history, PE findings, vital signs, ECG, and clinical laboratory tests at Screening and Check -in (Day -1), as determined by [CONTACT_737] 
(or designee).

Refer to the  current  Investi gator’s Brochure  (IB)1 for detailed information concerning the 
pharmacology, toxicology, drug metabolism, clinical studies, and adverse event (AE) profile of 
the investigational medicinal product. 
1.1. Background 
LOXO -292 is a small molecule and selective inhibitor of the rearranged during transfection 
(RET) receptor tyrosine kinase designed to competitively block the adenosine triphosphate 
binding site of the kinase. LOXO-[ADDRESS_542487] 250-fold more selective for RET than for 98% of [ADDRESS_542488] human cancer cell lines without RET alterations. Po tent and selective inhibition of RET may provide 
clinical benefit to subjects with malignancies due to oncogenic alterations in RET or with other mechanisms of increased RET activity.  
1.2. Summary of Nonclinical S tudies  
Cardiac safety of LOXO -292 was evaluated in a Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) in vitro  assay 
for human ether-a- go-go related gene (hERG) activity, in a GLP in vivo  study in conscious 
telemetry -instrumented minipi[INVESTIGATOR_14107], and in a GLP 28- day repeat -dose toxicology study (with 
electrocardiogram [ECG] mon itoring) in minipi[INVESTIGATOR_14107]. LOXO -292 had a 50% inhibitory 
concentration (IC
50) value of 1.1 μM in the GLP hERG assay, which is approximately 14- and 
6-fold higher than the predicted maximum unbound concentration at the dose of 80 mg and 160 mg respectively twice  daily. There were no LOXO -292- related changes in any 
cardiovascular endpoints including QT interval corrected for heart rate (QTc) at doses up to 12 mg/kg in the safety pharmacology cardiovascular study in conscious minipi[INVESTIGATOR_14107]. Furthermore, there were no LO XO-292- related ECG changes in the 28  day- repeat  dose- toxicity study in 
minipi[INVESTIGATOR_42423] 12 mg/kg. Together, these data indicate that LOXO -292 has a low 
risk of inducing delayed ventricular repolarization, prolongation of the QTc interval, and unstable arrhythmias.  In the 3-month repeated-dose study, an increase in QTc interval was noted 
in female minipi[INVESTIGATOR_42440] 5  mg/kg/day of LOXO -292, but the degree of the increase was 
small (approximately 7 to 12%) . These low magnitude QTc changes were potentially 
LOXO -292- related but were not considered adverse.  
Administration of LOXO -292 at single doses up to 45 mg/kg in male rats had no effect on 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_4806]. 
Potential effects of LOXO -292 on the central nervous system were evaluated as part of the 
GLP  28 day repeat -dose study in rats, in functional observational battery tests and locomotor 
activity assessments. Findings were limited to animals receiving the high dose on Week  4 of the 
dosing phase and were attributed to poor general body condi tion and weight changes associated 
with LOXO -292 administration rather than specific neurological effects. Additionally, no 
microscopic abnormalities in neuronal tissues were found.

Covance Study 8412-056 Protocol Reference:  LOXO -RET-[ZIP_CODE] 
Protocol Final: 20 June 2019  Page 16 of 53 In toxicology studies of LOXO -292 that were conducted in the rat and minipig, the primary 
pathologic findings for both species were in the tongue, pancreas, bone marrow, lymphoid 
tissues, physeal cartilage, and testes; while the gastrointestinal tract and ovaries were target tissues in minipig. Other target tissues identified in  the rat included: multi- tissue mineralization, 
incisor teeth, lung, Brunner’s gland, vagina, and possibly liver. Assessment of doses associated with moribundity/death revealed a steep dose response curve for both species. LOXO-292 was 
not mutagenic in the GLP bacterial mutation assay and was not clastogenic in the in vivo  
micronucleus assay. LOXO -292 was not found to be phototoxic when evaluated in an in vitro  
neutral red uptake phototoxicity assay. LOXO-292 is a developmental toxicant and is embryolethal.  
In repeated dose toxicity studies in Sprague- Dawley Rats, minor changes suggestive of hepatic 
effects were higher alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels in males (≥  20 mg/kg/day) and females (≥  50 mg/kg/day), higher aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 
levels in those receiving the high-dose (both sexes), and a higher cholesterol concentration in males (≥ 20 mg/kg/day). Reversible, LOXO-292- related decreases in liver and thymus weights 
occurred in males at 75 and 45 mg/kg/day, respectively. None of these minor changes were correlated to any liver findings microscopi[INVESTIGATOR_897], s uggesting minor functional alterations of the 
liver rather than overt hepatocellular injury. ALP levels were also increased in Göttingen minipi[INVESTIGATOR_42440] 5  or 12 mg/kg/day in repeated dose toxicity studies; however, this change 
had no associated clinical or microscopic findings and was considered not adverse. 
Based on preclinical pharmacology experiments with human cancer cells in vitro  and in murine 
xenograft models, meaningful inhibition of RET in tumors is expected to be achievable with oral 
dosing regimens ≥ 40 mg/day. 
Based on the nonclinical profile, including results from animal toxicology studies, theoretical 
risks of human exposure to LOXO-292 include the following: loss of appetite, decrease in body weight, increase in total white blood cells,  neutrophils, and monocytes, decrease in albumin, 
increase in globulin, decreased albumin:globulin ratio, decrease in total protein, increased body temperature, lethargy, increase in cholesterol and triglycerides, increase in phosphorus, changes in taste s ensation and/or development of xerostomia, gastrointestinal symptoms/signs: nausea, 
vomiting, loose stools, abdominal discomfort, decreases in red cell mass (red blood cell, hemoglobin, hematocrit) and reticulocytes, decrease in platelets, increases in liv er function tests 
(LFTs; ALP, AST, and ALT), possible pancreas injury, possible QTc prolongation, possible decreased testicular weight, possible increased vaginal mucous and altered menstruation/ovulation

ongoing Study LOXO- RET-[ZIP_CODE]. Interim safety and tolerability analysis showed that all dose 
levels were well -tolerated and there were no Grade ≥ 3 toxicities up to the maximum dose level 
tested (720 mg).  
As of a March 30, [ADDRESS_542491] dose administered.  
During dose escalation, 2 dose- limiting toxicities  (DLTs) were reported, both at the 240 mg 
twice daily  dose level: 1 DLT of Grade 3 tumor lysis syndrome and 1 DLT of Grade 3 
thrombocytopenia. The remaining 4 patients treated at this dose level cleared the 28 -day 
DLT  window and continued on study. The dosage of 160 mg  twice daily  was selected as the 
recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) based on safety data (N  = 82) and preliminary efficacy data 
(N = 64 evaluable ) for patients treated at doses from 20  mg once daily  through 240 mg  twice 
daily .2,3,4  
Across 9  dose levels ranging from 20 mg once daily to 240 mg twice daily in these 422 patients, 
treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) occurring in ≥ 15% patients were: dry mouth 
(30.8% total; 25.1% related), diarrhea (27.7% total; 12.8% related), hypertension (27.3% total; 
16.8% related), fatigue (22.3% total; 14.5% related), constipation (21.8% total; 10.0% related), AST increased (21.6% total; 15.6% related), ALT increased (20.4% total; 15.4% related), headache (18.7% total; 6.9% related), nausea (18.0% total; 6.6% related), edema peripheral (17.3% total; 9.5% related), and blood creatinine increased (14.9% total; 7.3% related). 
A total o f 205 (48.6%) patients across all dose levels experienced ≥ Grade 3 TEAEs. TEAEs of 
≥ Grade 3 that were considered to be related to study drug were reported in 95 (22.5%) patients 
across all dose levels. The most common Grade ≥ 3 TEAEs included hypertension (12.3%; 7.1% related), ALT increased (6.2%; 4.7% related), AST increased (4.7%; 3.1% related), hyponatremia (4.3%; 0.2% related), ECG QT prolonged (2.8%; 2.1% related), dyspnea and lymphopenia (each 2.6%; 0% and 0.9% related, respectively), diarrhea and thrombocytopenia (each 2.1%; 0.7% and 1.7% related, respectively). All other Grade ≥ 3 TEAEs occurred in less 
than 2% of patients overall.  
Sixteen patients have died within [ADDRESS_542492] been 
attributed to study drug. 
As of April 15, 2019, pharmacokinetic (PK) data were available from 335  patients. LOXO -292 is 
absorbed after oral administration with a median time to maximum observed concentration (t
max) 
of approximately 2 hours.  As of March 30, 2019, Loxo Oncology initiated 40 single-patient protocols (SPPs), S pecial 
Access Scheme, Compassionate Use, or Temporary Authorization Use (ATU) cases to provide 
access to LOXO -292 for patients with clinical need not meeting eligibility criteria for the 
ongoing clinical study. For the SPPs, Special Access Scheme, Compassionate Use, or ATU 
cases, only serious adverse events (SAEs) are required to be reported. To date, there have been [ADDRESS_542493] been reported as

Protocol Final: 20 June 2019  Page 18 of 53 serious adverse reactions (SARs) which were submitted as Suspected Unexpected Serious 
Adverse Reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs).  
Preliminary PK data available from completed studies (LOXO -RET -[ZIP_CODE] and 
LOXO -RET-[ZIP_CODE]) in healthy subjects indicate that LOXO- 292 has an estimated apparent 
terminal elimination half -life (t½) of approximately 24 hours after a single dose. 
Refer to the current IB1 for detailed and updated background clinical study information on 
LOXO -292. 
1.4. Study Rationale 
LOXO -292 has pH-dependent s olubility and its PK can be affected by [CONTACT_428797] (eg, omeprazole). Under fasted conditions, following a single dose of 160 mg LOXO-292 administered to 20 omeprazole- treated healthy volunteers, the area 
under the concentration -time curve (AUC) and C
max of LOXO-292 were approximately 69% to 
88% lower than following administration of LOXO-[ADDRESS_542494] of omeprazole on the PK of LOXO-292 is reduced or eliminated when LOXO -292 is 
given with a high-calorie, high- fat meal. The AUC of LOXO -292 following administration of a 
single dose of 160 mg with a high -calorie, high -fat meal to 20 omeprazole- treated healthy 
volunteers was approximately 2% higher than following 160 mg LOXO-292 given under fasted 
conditions without omeprazole, although C
max was approximately 49% lower. Therefore, during 
Period 3, LOXO -[ADDRESS_542495] (ranitidine) administered with a single dose of LOXO-[ADDRESS_542496] of multiple-doses of a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) (omeprazole) administered with a single dose of LOXO-292 given with a low- fat meal on the PK 
of LOXO-292 in healthy adult subjects. 
1.5. Benefit -risk Assessm ent 
Subjects in the current study will not receive any health benefit (beyond that of an assessment of 
their medical status) from participating in the study.  
The risks of participation are primarily those associated with adverse reactions to the study treatments, although there may also be some discomfort from collection of blood samples and 
other study procedures. More information about the known and expected benefits, risks, and reasonably anticipated AEs associated with LOXO -292 may be found in the current  IB.

The safety  monitoring practices employed by [CONTACT_3181] (ie, 12- lead electrocardiogram [ECG], 
vital signs, clinical laboratory tests, AE questioning, and physical examinations [PEs]) are adequate to protect the subjects’ safety.  
2. OBJECTIVES AND ENDPOINTS  
2.1. Objectives 
The objectives of this study are:  
Primary:  
• To assess the effect of multiple doses of an H2 antagonist (ranitidine) administered with 
a single dose of LOXO-292 on the PK of LOXO-292 under fasted conditions in healthy adult subjects. 
• To assess the effect o f multiple doses of a PPI (omeprazole) administered with a single 
dose of LOXO-292 on the PK of LOXO-292 given with a low- fat meal in healthy adult 
subjects.  
Secondary:  
• To determine the safety and tolerability of a single dose of LOXO-[ADDRESS_542497] (ranitidine) under fasted conditions, and in combination with a PPI (omeprazole) given with a low- fat meal in 
healthy adult subjects.  
2.2. Endpoints  
The following PK parameters will be calculated whenever possible, based on the plasma 
concentrations of LOXO-292 (as appropriate) : area under the concentration -time curve from 
Hour [ADDRESS_542498] measurable  concentration ( AUC
0-t), area under the concentration time curve 
extrapolated to infinity ( AUC 0-∞), extrapolation for area under the concentration time curve 
(%AUC extrap), maximum plasma concentration ( Cmax), tmax, elimination rate constant ( λZ), 
apparent systemic clearance ( CL/F ), and apparent terminal elimination half -life (t½). 
Safety and tolerabi lity will be assessed by [CONTACT_42466], performing PEs and clinical 
laboratory tests, measuring vital signs, and recording ECGs.

Protocol Final: [ADDRESS_542499] of 10 hours prior to and 4 hours after the LOXO-292 dose. Blood samples  for LOXO -292 
PK analysis will be taken for 168 hours after the  LOXO-292 dose on Day 1. 
In Period 2, multiple oral doses of ranitidine will be administered twice daily from Day 8 until Day 18 inclusively (for a total of 11 consecutive days) and administered with a singl e oral dose 
of LOXO-[ADDRESS_542500] of 10 hours prior to and 4 hours after the 
LOXO -292 dose. On Day 12, ranitidine will be administered 2 hour s (± 10 minutes) after the 
LOXO -292 dose. On Days 8-11 and 13-18, the morning dose of ranitidine will be administered 
(with breakfast) approximately 2 hours (± 1 hour) after the planned or actual time of the Day 12 LOXO -292 dose and the evening dose of ranitidine will be administered (with a light 
meal/snack) approximately 10  hours (± 1 hour) prior to the planned or actual time of the Day 12 
LOXO -292 dose. Blood samples for LOXO -292 PK analysis will be taken for 168 hours after the 
LOXO -292 dose on Day 12.  
In Period 3, multiple oral doses of omeprazole will be administered once daily from Day 19 until Day 29 inclusively (for a total of 11 consecutive days) and administered with a single oral dose 
of LOXO-[ADDRESS_542501] of 2 hours prior to and 1 hour after the omeprazole dose 
(Note: omeprazole will be administered at approximately  the actual time of the Day 12 
LOXO -292 dosing). Blood samples  for LOXO -[ADDRESS_542502] dose of omeprazole in Period 3.  
To assess thei r eligibility to enter the study, potential subjects will be screened within 28 days 
(Days -29 to -2) and be admitted to the Clinical Research Unit (CRU) on Day - 1 (Check -in). 
Replacement subjects may be enrolled only if deemed necessary by [CONTACT_1034].  Subjects will be confined at the CRU from the time of Check -in (Day  -1) until End of Treatment 
(EOT) on Day  30 upon completion of all PK and safety assessments or Early Termination (ET) if 
the subject discontinues. A follow-up phone call will occur for all subjects who received at least 
1 dose of study drug (including subjects who are terminated early) 7 days (± 2 days) after EOT or ET.

Protocol Final: [ADDRESS_542503] who is enrolled in the study signs an 
Informed Consent Form (ICF). Note that enrolled subjects are defined as those subjects who are 
assigned a dose of study drug; this definition excludes screen failure subjects.  
In this study, PEs, 12-lead ECGs, vital signs, How Do You Feel? (HDYF?) inquiries, clinical 
chemistr y panel , coagulation parameters, complete blood count ( CBC ), and urinalysis ( UA; 
Appendix 2) and recording of concomitant medications will be performed at specified times 
during the study (for specific timepoints and de tails on each study variable, refer to  Appendix 4). 
AEs and SAEs will be collected beginning at informed consent. AEs will be rep orted throughout 
the study (ie, from signing of the ICF until End of Study [EOS], or until ET if the subject 
discontinues from the study and does not complete a follow-up phone call ), either as subject 
medical history (if the event is reported as beginning prior to signing of the ICF or if the event occurs prior to study drug administration on Day 1 and is assessed as not related to study procedures by [CONTACT_737] [or designee]) or as AEs (if the event occurs after signing of the ICF but prior to study drug administration on Day [ADDRESS_542504] igator [or designee], or if the event occurs after study drug 
administration on Day 1 through EOT or ET regardless of relationship to study drug). From EOT 
or ET through EOS, only AEs assessed as related to study drug by [CONTACT_737] (or designee) are to be reported. All SAEs that develop from the time of ICF signing until EOS (or ET, if the 
subject discontinues from the study and does not complete a follow-up phone call ) are to be 
reported.

3.2. Discussion of Study Desig n 
This study will evaluate the effect of multiple doses of an H2 antagonist (ranitidine) administered 
under fasted conditions and the effect of effect of multiple-doses of a PPI (omeprazole) given with a low -fat meal on the PK of LOXO-292 in healthy adult subjects.  
Gastric pH can alter the absorption of acidic and basic drugs and nonclinical study results indicate that LOXO -292 may be sensitive to gastric pH. T he Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA ) has recently published a review on the topic and has encouraged studies to address the 
effects of coadministration of gastric pH modifiers on oral exposure.
[ADDRESS_542506] on acid secretion due to the irreversible 
nature of omeprazole binding to H+ /K+ ATPase pump, the omeprazole treatment portion will be 
conducted only in Period [ADDRESS_542507] of a PPI [CONTACT_4490] a low- fat meal can be assessed 
without confounding factors.

Protocol Final: 20 June 2019  Page 22 of 53 3.3. Selection of Doses in the Study  
LOXO -292 
An oral dose has been selected for this study because this is the intended clinical route of 
administration. The dose of 160 mg of LOXO-292 was selected based on clinical study results 
and its observed PK profile. The 160 mg dose is expected to ensure sufficient quantifiable 
plasma concentr ations of LOXO -292 for determination of systemic PK exposure. In a Phase 1/2 
clinical study in cancer patients (LOXO -RET -[ZIP_CODE]), 160 mg of LOXO-292 dosed twice daily 
has been evaluated and has been selected for further testing in a larger number of cancer patients 
to evaluate its safety and efficacy.  
Omeprazole: 
A dose of [ADDRESS_542508] of 
omeprazole on acid secretion increases with repeated once- daily dosing, reaching a plateau after 
4 days.  
Ranitidine : 
A dose of [ADDRESS_542509] findings in 
the intended patient population.

Protocol Final: [ADDRESS_542510] dose of LOXO-292 administration: 
• Male sterilization, with documented confirmation of surgical success. Male subjects will be surgically sterile for at least 90 days prior to Check -in (Day -1). If 
documentation is not available, male subjects must follow one of the contraception methods below: 
o Male condom with spermicide, and 
o For a female partner of male study participant: 
- Intrauterine device (IUD) (hormonal IUD; eg, Mirena
®). Copper 
IUDs are acceptable (eg, ParaGard®); 
- Establ ished use of oral, implanted, transdermal, intravaginal, or 
hormonal method of contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation; or 
- Bilateral tubal ligation.  
Males who practice true abstinence because of a lifestyle choice (ie, do not become abstinent just for the purpose of study participation) are exempt from contraceptive requirements. Periodic abstinence by a female partner (eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of 
contraception. If  a male subject is abstinent at the time of signing the ICF but becomes 
sexually active through EOS, he must agree to use contraception as described above.  
For male subjects, sexual intercourse with female partners who are pregnant,  or 
breastfeeding should be avoided. Male subjects are required to refrain from donation of 
sperm from Check -in (Day -1) until 6  months after administration  of study drug. 
For subjects who are exclusively in same-sex relationships, contraceptive requirements do not apply.

Protocol Final: 20 June 2019  Page 35 of 53 7.2. Safety and Tolerability Assessments  
Safety evaluations may be repeated at the discretion of the Investigator (or designee) or Sponsor.  
Every effort will be made to schedule and perform the procedures in accordance with the 
nominal time, giving considerations to appropriate posture conditions, practical restrictions, and any other procedures to be performed at the same timepoint. The order of priority for scheduling procedures around a timepoint is (in descending order of priority):  
• Dosing 
• Pharmacokinetic blood sampling 
• Vital signs assessments  
• ECG  
• Blood and urine samples for clinical laboratories 
• PE 
7.2.1. Adverse Events  
Adverse event definitions; assignment of severity, causality, action taken, and outcome; and procedures for reporting SAEs are detailed in Appendix 1. 
Subjects will be asked a nonleading HDYF? question such as “Have there been any changes in your health status since Screening/since you were last asked?” at the timepoints specifi ed in 
Appendix 4 (ie, at Screening [after the ICF is signed], at Check -in (Day -1), at each postdose 
vital signs assessment, and at an appropriate time for all other days). Subjects will also be encouraged to voluntaril y report AEs occurring at any other time through the EOS. 
AEs, whether volunteered, identified by [CONTACT_423]’s responses to HDYF? inquiries, or noted on PE, ECG, vital signs assessments, or laboratory tests, will be recorded throughout the study (ie, from  signing of the ICF until EOS [or ET if the subject discontinues from the study and does not 
complete a follow -up phone call]), either as subject medical history (if the event is reported as 
beginning prior to signing of the ICF or if the event occurs prior to study drug administration on Day 1 and is assessed as not related to study procedures by [CONTACT_737] [or designee]) or as AEs (if the event occurs after signing of the ICF but prior to study drug administration on Day 1 and is assessed as related  to study procedures by [CONTACT_737] [or designee], or if the event 
occurs after study drug administration on Day 1 through EOT or ET regardless of relationship to study drug). From EOT or ET through EOS, only AEs assessed as related to study drug by t he 
Investigator (or designee) are to be reported.  All SAEs that develop from the time of ICF signing 
until EOS (or ET, if the subject discontinues from the study and does not complete a follow-up phone call) are to be reported.
  
Unless a subject withdraws consent or is withdrawn from the study and does not complete the follow-up phone call, all subjects must be followed until EOS. Subjects with AEs that are assessed as related to study drug by [CONTACT_737] (or designee) which are ongoing at EOS may continue to be followed until the symptoms or value(s) return to normal, or acceptable levels, as

designee) should use appropriate judgment in ordering additional tests as necessary to monitor the resolution of events. The Sponsor may request that additional safety tests be performed.  
Subjects will receive a follow -up phone call 7 days (± 2 days) after EOT or ET to determine if 
any AE has occurred since the EOT or ET visit.  At all times, a subject may be required to remain at the CRU for longer at the discretion of the 
Investigator (or designee).  
Any event that meets the criteria of a S[LOCATION_003]R will be reported to the Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) according to CRU policy by [CONTACT_737] (or designee) and to regulatory authorities by [CONTACT_1034] (or Sponsor designee) according to regulatory authority requirements. Refer to Reference Safety Information in the current IB

LOXO -292 for expected adverse reactions.  
7.2.2. Clinical Laboratory Evaluations 
Clinical laboratory evaluations (clinical chemistry panel [fasted at least 8  hours], coagulation 
parameters, CBC, TSH , hemoglobin A1c [Screening only], and UA) will be collected at the 
timepoints  specified in  Appendix 4. 
Screens for HCV antibody, HBsAg, and HIV antibody will be performed at Screening. A urine 
drug screen for selected drugs of abuse (including cotinine) and an alcohol breath test will be perform ed at Screening and repeated at Check -in (Day -1) for all subjects. A serum qualitative 
pregnancy test (females only) and an FSH test (postmenopausal females only) will be performed 
at the timepoints specified in  Appendix 4.  
The number of blood samples and total blood volume required for clinical laboratory evaluations is presented in Appendix 3. A list of the specific evaluation is in  Appendix 2. 
7.2.3. Vital Signs  
Vital signs (including oral temperature, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and supi[INVESTIGATOR_42430]) will be obtained at the timepoints specified in  Appendix 4. 
Blood pressure and HR measurements should be performed using the same arm for each reading and measurements should be taken after the subject has been resting in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_21683] 5  minutes.  
When vital signs assessments are scheduled at the same time as blood draws, the blood draws will be obtained at the scheduled timepoint, and the vital signs will be obtained prior to and as close as possible to the scheduled blood draw. 
7.2.4. 12-L ead Electrocardiogram  
A 12 -lead ECG (including PR, RR, QRS, and QT interval parameters) will be obtained after the 
subject has been resting for at least 10  minutes in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_428793] 37 of 62

Adverse Events  
Definition of Adverse Events  
An adverse event (AE; or adverse experience) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence 
experienced b y a patient or healthy subject, whether or not considered drug related by [CONTACT_3786] (or designee). A treatment -emergent AE is an AE that is reported after a dose of 
study drug. 
The following are all AEs: 
• Unfavorable changes in general condition;  
• Subjective or objective signs/symptoms;  
• Concomitant diseases or accidents;  
• Clinically relevant adverse changes in laboratory parameters observed in a subject 
during a clinical study.  
Adverse events comprise all disturbances of general health status, subjective and objective disease symptoms (including laboratory abnormalities that are deemed clinically significant by [CONTACT_18370]), and accidents observed in the context of a clinical trial, irrespective of a possible causal relationship with the administration of the trial substance.  
Categorization of Adverse Events 
The severity of AEs will be categorized based on the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 5.0 as follows: 
• Grade 1 Mild:  Asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations 
only; intervention not indicated 
• Grade 2 Moderate:  Minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting 
age-appropriate instrumental Activities of Daily Living (ADL)*  
• Grade 3 Severe or med ically significant but not immediately life threatening:  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3111]; disabling; limiting self -
care ADL**  
• Grade 4 Life- threatening consequences : Urgent intervention indicated  
• Grade 5 Death related to AE  
Note: Not all grades are appropriate for all AEs. Therefore, some AEs are listed within the CTCAE with fewer than 
5 options for grade selection. Grade 5 (death) is not appropriate for some AEs and therefore is not an option.  
* Instrumental ADL refer to preparing meals, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3112], using the telephone, managing 
money, etc.  
**Self -care ADL refer to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not 
bedridden.

Protocol CONFIDENTIAL  
Covance Study 8412-056 Protocol Reference:  LOXO -RET-[ZIP_CODE] 
Protocol Final: 20 June 2019  Page 46 of 53 The Investigator (or designee) will make a determination of the relationship of the AE to the 
study drug using a 2- category system according to the following guidelines: 
• NOT RELATED  = The time course between the administration of investigational 
product and the occurrence or worsening of the AE rules out a causal relationship and another cause (eg, concomitant drugs, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], complications, comorbidities) is suspected;  
• RELATED  = The time course between administration of investigational product and 
the occurrence or worsening of the AE is co nsistent with a causal relationship and no 
other cause (eg, concomitant drugs, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], complications, comorbidities) can be identified.  
An AE is associated with the use of the drug if there is a reasonable possibility that the experience may have been caused by [CONTACT_33641].  
Pregnancy  
As information is available, a pregnancy (including pregnancy in female partners of male subjects) diagnosed through EOS or ET (if the subject discontinues from the study and does not complete a follow -up phone call)
 and for up to 90 days after study drug administration should be 
reported by [CONTACT_737] (or designee) via eFax to the Sponsor’s clinical safety representative within 24 hours of being notified. The Sponsor’s safety representative will then forward the Pregnancy  Form to the Investigator for completion.  
eFax: +[PHONE_736] 
A subject becoming pregnant while on study drug will immediately be withdrawn from the study and early termination study procedures will be performed. The subject or partner should be followed by [CONTACT_42498]. If the pregnancy ends for any reason before the anticipated date, the Investigator should notify the Sponsor’s clinical safety representative. At the completion of the pregnancy, the Investigator will document the outcome of the pregnancy. If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for immediate classification as a serious AE (SAE; ie, postpartum complication, spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly), the Investigator should follow the procedures for reporting an SAE.  
Male subjects will be instructed to notify the Investigator immediately if they discover their sexual partner is pregnant. In this instance, the partner must provide written consent before pregnanc y information can be collected. When a CRU becomes aware that the female partner of 
a male subject is pregnant, they are to contact [CONTACT_201433] (within 24  hours of 
the CRU staff becoming aware of the event) in addition to notifying the Sponsor’s safety representative via eFax.  
All pregnancies should be recorded on the AE eCRF, in addition to completion of the required pregnancy forms. If the Investigator suspects that a pregnancy was the result of an interaction

Protocol CONFIDENTIAL  
Covance Study 8412-056 Protocol Reference:  LOXO -RET-[ZIP_CODE] 
Protocol Final: 20 June 2019  Page 47 of 53 between the study treatment and the contraceptive method, in addition to the pregnancy the drug 
interaction should also be captured as a separate AE.  
Definition of Serious Adverse Events 
An SAE (by [CONTACT_428804]) is any adverse drug experience occurring at any dose that results in 
any of the following outcomes: 
• Death;  
• A life -threatening adverse drug experience (ie, one that places the subject, in the view 
of the Investigator [or designee], at immediate risk of death); 
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]; 
• A persistent or significant disability/incapacity;  
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect;  
• An important medical event that may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the above outcomes. 
Important medical events that may not result in de ath, be life threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_37347], based on appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  
Unexpected Adverse Drug Reaction  
An AE or suspected adverse drug reaction is considered ‘unexpected’ if the event is not listed in the Reference Safety Information section of the IB or if it is not listed at the specificity or severity that  has been observed for an unapproved investigational medicinal product. 
Reporting 
Food and Drug Administration- reportable AEs are AEs that are associated with the use of the 
drug and represent events that are assessed as serious, related, and unexpected. F ood and Drug 
Administration -reportable AEs will be reported by [CONTACT_428805] (IRB). Final determination of whether an event represents a S[LOCATION_003]R will be the responsibility of the Sponsor. 
Within [ADDRESS_542541] recognized or reported, 
and within 24 hours of any SAE (regardless of whether the event is assessed as related or unrelated to study drug) being first recognized or reported, the Sponsor’s clinica l safety 
representative will be notified by [CONTACT_42500] (eg, facsimile) using the following eFax number or email:

Protocol Final: 20 June 2019  Page 48 of 53 eFax: +[PHONE_736] 
email: [EMAIL_814] 
To report the SAE, the completed report form should be sent by [CONTACT_42501]’s clinical 
safety representative within 24 hours of awareness. Incoming reports are reviewed during normal business hours. Additional reporting instructions and the SAE Report Form are provided in the Study Manual.  
The IRB will be notified of any FDA- reportable AE within the timeframe required by [CONTACT_1201]. 
The IRB Serious and Unexpected Adverse Experience Submission Form will be completed and 
submitted with the copy of the written confirmation or summary of the AE.

Females of nonchildbearing potential, defined as being permanently sterile  (ie, due to  
hysterectomy, bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656], bilateral oophorectomy, bilateral tubal ligation or 
confirmed tubal occlusion more than 6 months prior to study drug administration) or 
postmenopausal (defined as at least 12 months postcessation of mense s without an alternative 
medical cause). Postmenopausal status will be confirmed with a screening serum FSH level  
≥ 40 mIU/mL. All females must have a negative qualitative serum pregnancy test (serum  
human chorionic gonadotropin) at Screening and Check -in (Day -1)

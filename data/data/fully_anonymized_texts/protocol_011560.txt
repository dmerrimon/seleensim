Title of Study:   An Open -Label Postmarketing Milk -Only Lactation Study to Evaluate the Concentration 
of Bempedoic Acid and Bempedoic Acid and Ezetimibe in the Breast Milk of Healthy Lactating Women 
Administered Therapeutic Doses of Bempedoic Acid or Bempedoic Acid /Ezetimibe  Fixed Combination 
Drug Product (FCDP)  
Study Number:   1002FDC -075 
Phase of Development:   4 
Clinical Sites:   1 to 2 sites in [LOCATION_002]  
Objectives:  
Primary : 
The primary objectives of this study are to  estimate infant exposure to bempedoic acid or bempedoic 
acid and  ezetimibe : 
• estimate the daily infant dosage and relative infant dose (RID) of bempedoic acid in mature 
breast milk after administration of bempedoic acid  for 6  consecutive days , and 
• estimate the daily infant dosage and RID of bempedoic acid and ezetimibe in mature breast milk 
after administration of bempedoic acid/ezetimibe FCDP for 6 consecutive days.  
Secondary : 
The secondary objectives of this study are to  characterize the excretion of bempedoic acid  or 
bempedoic acid  and ezetimibe  in mature breast milk of healthy lactating women who receive a once 
daily dose of bempedoic acid  or bempedoic acid/ezetimibe FCDP for 6 consecutive days : 
• determine concentrations o f bempedoic acid, active  metabolite ESP15228  and bempedoic acid 
glucuronide  in mature breast milk collected over 24  hours from healthy subjects administered 
bempedoic acid  or bempedoic acid/ezetimibe FCDP , and  
• determine concentrations of ezetimibe  and metabolite ezetimibe -glucuronide in mature breast 
milk collected over 24 hours from healthy subjects administered bempedoic acid/ezetimibe 
FCDP.  
Safety : 
The safety objective of this study is  to evaluate the safety of 6 consecutive doses of bempedoic a cid 
or bempedoic acid/ezetimibe FCDP in healthy lactating women.  
Study Design:  
This is a Phase 4, open -label study that will estimate the daily infant dosage  and RID of bempedoic acid 
and bempedoic acid/ezetimibe in the mature breast milk of healthy wome n who have  receiv ed 6 daily 
doses of  bempedoic acid or bempedoic acid/ezetimibe  FCDP .  The excretion of bempedoic acid, 
ezetimibe, and metabolites ESP15228 , bempedoic acid glucuronide , and ezetimibe -glucuronide will be 
characterized  in mature breast milk .  Healthy lactating women who choose to stop breastfeeding their 
infant for the duration of the Treatment and Washout Period s will be eligible to participate once all 
Bempedoic Acid and Bempedoic Acid/Ezetimibe FCDP  Esperion Therapeutics, Inc.  
Clinical Study Protocol 1002FDC -[ADDRESS_83512] milk that is 
currently being produced.  
Screening  Period :  The Screening Period will begin with a Screening Visit (Visit S1) that will occur up 
to 42 days prior to randomization (Visit T1) .  Visit S1 will allow the Investigator to assess the subject’s 
eligibility  and current breastfeeding practices .  After the subject provides written informed consent, the 
subject will undergo screening assessments as outlined in Appendix  1.  Study staff will sched ule a n 
optional  lactation consultant visit for those subjects who desire  support  related to feeding/care of the 
infant such as preparing for the treatment and washout period s of the study , pumpi[INVESTIGATOR_76729] , introducing infant formula , introducing bottle feeding  or resuming breastfeeding after Day 13 
(FU1). Additional  lactation consultant visits may be schedule d for subjects  anytime throughout the study.  
 
Treatment  Period :  Subjects who meet all eligibility criteria will be instructed to report to the clinical 
research unit (CRU) on Day 1  (Visit T1) .  Subjects who continue to meet eligibility criteria must confirm  
their infant is able to feed from a bottle , adequate stored breast milk and/or infant  formula is available to 
feed the infant for the duration of the study , and the subject is maintain ing adequate  breast  milk 
production.  If a subject is weaning, duration of weaning will be documented.  Subjects will then be 
randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either bempedoic acid  (Cohor t 1) or bempedoic acid/ezetimibe FCDP  
(Cohort 2).   Eight subjects  will be in each cohort.   While at the CRU, subjects will provide a predose 
blood sample for  pharmacokinetic ( PK) and safety laboratories.  Subjects will use an electric breast pump 
to provide a predose breast milk sample and will then receive the first dose of investigational medicinal 
product  (IMP ).  When Visit T1 assessments are complete, subjects will be provided with adequate IMP 
supply to support once -daily dosing on Days 2, 3, 4 and 5  by [CONTACT_76746] - at home .  Subjects will 
be reminded that their infant(s) must not be fed with  their breast milk that is produced after the first dose 
of IMP through Day [ADDRESS_83513] dose of IMP.  In addition, subjects will document the day and time of when 
IMP was taken for Day 2 through Day 5 in the Study Drug Diary .  On the evening of Day  5 (Visit T2) , 
subjects will check -in to the CRU for 2 overnights  (with Sponsor approval, subjects may check -in to the 
CRU on the morning of Day 6 ).  Subjects must su bmit their Study Drug Diary at CRU check -in.  Study 
staff will review the diary and assess IMP adherence.  On the morning of Day 6, subjects will pump both 
breasts with an electric pump until completely emptied.  When pumpi[INVESTIGATOR_53090], Cohort 1  subjects 
will receive the Day  6 dose of bempedoic acid and Cohort 2 subjects will receive the Day 6 dose of  
bempedoic acid/ezetimibe FCDP .  Breast milk will be collected from each subject  over the next 24 hours 
using an electric pump at 3, 6, 9, 12, 16, 2 0 and 24 hours (±30  minutes) after Day [ADDRESS_83514] will be mixed together and the total volume measured and recorded.  On Day

Follow -up Period :  On Day 13, all subjects will be contact[CONTACT_76747] a post -treatment Follow -up 
Visit (Visit FU1/End -of-Study [EOS] ).  Breastfeeding may resume after Visit FU1  on Day 13.  An 
optional lactation consultant visit will be scheduled  for those subjects who desire to re -establish 
breastfeeding.  On Day 43 (FU2), study staff will contact [CONTACT_76748] (if intended).  
 
Number of Subjects (planned):   Approximately 16 (8 bempedoic acid  [Cohort 1]  and 8  bempedoic 
acid/ezetimibe FCDP  [Cohort 2] ) healthy lactating female subjects will be enrolled.  If a subject 
discontinues the study early or does not receive [ADDRESS_83516] will be enrolled and assigned to the same 
treatment.

Bempedoic acid (ETC -1002) is an oral, first -in class, small molecule that inhibits adenosine 
triphosphate -citrate lyase (ACL), an enzyme upstream of 3 -hydroxy -3-methylglutaryl coenzyme 
A (HMG -CoA) reductase in the cholesterol  biosynthesis pathway. Bempedoic acid, like statins, 
up-regulates  low density lipoprotein cholesterol  (LDL -C) receptors.  
Bempedoic acid 180 mg and bempedoic acid  180 mg/ezetimibe [ADDRESS_83538] (FCDP), under the marketed names of Nexl etol® and Nexlizet®, respectively, have been 
approved by [CONTACT_24623] (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as an adjunct to diet 
and maximally tolerated statin therapy for the treatment of heterozygous familial 
hypercholesterolemia or established a therosclerotic cardiovascular disease in adults who require 
additional lowering of LDL -C (Nexletol 2020 USPI ; Nexlizet 2020 USPI ). In the European 
Union (EU) bempedoic acid and bempedoic acid /ezetimib e fixed combination medicinal product 
(FCMP) have been approved by [CONTACT_76749]® and Nustendi®, respectively, for the treatment of primary hypercholesterolemia 
(heterozygous familial and non -familial) or mixed dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_76733]: in 
combination with a statin or statin with other lipid -lowering therapi[INVESTIGATOR_76734] -C goals with the maximum tolerated dose of statin, or alone or in combination with other 
lipid-lowering thera pi[INVESTIGATOR_76735] -intolerant or for whom a statin is 
contraindicated. Additionally, Nustendi is indicated in patients already being treated with the 
combination of bempedoic acid and ezetimibe as separate tablets with or without statin 
(Nilemdo  2020 SmPC ; Nustendi 2020 SmPC ). 
Bempedoic acid and bempedoic acid/ezetimibe FCDP have been studied in adults with  
heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia  (HeFH ) or established atherosclerotic car diovascular 
disease ( ASCVD ) who require additional LDL -C lowering but data do not exist for lactating 
women who may choose to continue breastfeeding their infant in conjunction with bempedoic 
acid or bempedoic acid/ezetimibe FCDP therapy.  There is no info rmation regarding the 
excretion of bempedoic acid  in human or animal milk, the effects of bempedoic acid  on the 
breastfed infant, or the effects of bempedoic acid  on milk production.  Bempedoic acid decreases 
cholesterol synthesis and possibly the synthesi s of other biologically active substances derived 
from cholesterol and theoretically may cause harm to the breastfed infant.  In addition, it is not 
known whether ezetimibe i s excreted into human milk.  In rat studies, exposure to total ezetimibe  
in nursin g pups was up to half of that observed in maternal plasma (Zetia 2020  USPI ). 
The USPI s for bempedoic acid  (Nexletol 2020  USPI ) and bempedoic acid/ezetimibe FCDP 
(Nexlizet 2020 USPI ) note breastfeeding is not recommended with either therapy and the SmPCs 
for bempedoic acid  (Nilemdo  2020  SmPC ) and bempedoic acid/ezetimibe FCMP (Nustendi 2020  
SmPC ) state breastfeeding is c ontraindicated.   As a result of the current labeling in conjunction 
with the paucity of data, patients, along with their health care providers, must make decisions 
about bempedoic acid  and bempedoic acid/ezetimibe FCDP therapy during lactation with a lack 
of evidence -based data regarding the excretion of bempedoic acid  or bempedoic acid  and 
ezetimibe  into breast milk and the potential exposure to the breast fed infant.

bempedoic acid  or bempedoic acid  and ezetimibe  in breast milk after 6 consecutive daily doses 
of bempedoic acid  or bempedoic acid/ezetimibe FCDP.  
4.2 Background of Bempedoic Acid and Bempedoic Acid/Ezetimibe FCDP  
Bempedoic acid is an ACL inhibitor that lowers LDL -C by [CONTACT_76751].  Adenosine triphosphate -citrate lyase is an enzyme upstream of HMG -CoA reductase in 
the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway.  Bempedoic acid and its active metabolite ESP15228  
require coenzyme A (CoA)  activation by [CONTACT_76752] -chain acyl -CoA synthetase 1 (ACSVL1) to 
ETC -1002 -CoA and ESP [ZIP_CODE] -CoA, respectively.  Inhibition of ACL by [CONTACT_76753] -1002 -CoA 
results in decreased cholesterol synthesis in the liver and lowers LDL -C in blood via 
upregulation of low -density lipoprotein receptors.  
Bempedoic acid and bempedoic acid/ezetimibe FCDP have been approved by [CONTACT_76754] ( EMA ) based on the positive safety and efficacy profiles of large 
Phase [ADDRESS_83540] recen t Investigator Brochure  (IB) for more 
detailed information regarding nonclinical experience and previous human experience along with 
the USPIs  and the SmPCs  for bempedoic acid and bempedoic acid/ezetimibe FCDP.  
4.3 Dose Selection  
A dose of bempedoic acid 180  mg once per day was selected based on approved doses by [CONTACT_76755] (Nexletol ) and the European Medicines Agency ( Nilemdo ).  The dose for bempedoic 
acid/ezetimibe FCDP (bempedo ic acid 180  mg/ezetimibe 10  mg) was selected based on 
approved doses by [CONTACT_55257] ( Nexlizet)  and the European Medicines Agency ( Nustendi ).  For 
additional information please refer to the most recent IB, the USPIs for  Nexletol  and Nexlizet  
and the SmPCs for Nilemdo  and Nustendi . 
Subjects enrolled in the study will be dose d for 6 consecutive days in order to reach steady -state 
concentrations of bempedoic acid  or bempedoic acid and ezetimibe  in plasma.  Steady -state 
concentrations in plasma are expected after 5 to 7 days of repeat dosing as estimates of 
elimination half -life of bempedoic acid  and ezetimibe  are each approximately 24 hours.  A once 
daily dosing regimen for 6 days will achieve plasma concentrations that are approximately 98% 
of steady -state levels.  Six days of repeat dosing have been  selected to ensure subjects  are at 
steady -state plasma concentrations of bempedoic acid  or bempedoic acid and ezetimibe  for 
pharmacokinetic (PK) assessments.   
4.4 Risk Benefit Summary  
Subjects in this clinical study are healthy lactating volunteers who choose to stop breastfeeding 
their infant for the duration of the Treatment and Washout Period s (13 days) and will not receive 
any health benefit from participating in this study.  Both bempedoic acid and bempedoic 
acid/ezetimibe  FCDP are approved by [CONTACT_76756].

[IP_ADDRESS]  General Monitoring and Management of Abnormal Clinical Lab oratory  
Assessments  
It is the Investigator’s responsibility to review the results of all laboratory tests as they become 
available and to sign and date the review.  For each laboratory test result outside of the 
laboratory normal reference range, the Investigator needs to ascertain if this is a clinically 
significant change from baseline for the individual subject, with baseline defined as the last value 
or observation before the first dose of IMP.  The Investigator may repeat the laboratory test or 
request additional tests to verify the results of the original laborat ory test.  
If a laboratory value is determined to be abnormal and is a clinically significant change from 
baseline for the subject, the Investigator should determine if it qualifies as an  
AE (Section  13.2.3), and if yes, an appropriate eCRF will be completed.  All clinically 
significant laboratory abnormalities occurring during the study that were not present at baseline 
should be followed and evaluated with additional tests if necessary, until diagnosis of the 
underlying cause or resolution.   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Total Blood Volume of Clinical Laboratory Samples  
The total number of venipunctures and total volume of whole blood collected during the study 
will be limited to that needed for safety and PK.  Total whole blood volume  collected over the 
study duration is not to exceed approximately [ADDRESS_83588].  
  
Bempedoic Acid and Bempedoic Acid/Ezetimibe FCDP  Esperion Therapeutics, Inc.  
Clinical Study Protocol 1002FDC -[ADDRESS_83589]’s medical 
record.  
An AE can be:  
• any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated  with the use of a medicinal product, 
whether or not considered related to the medicinal product , 
• any new disease or exacerbation of an existing disease , or 
• any deterioration in nonprotocol -required measurements of laboratory value or other 
clinical test ( e.g., ECG or x -ray) that results in symptoms, a change in treatment, or 
discontinuation from IMP . 
13.1.2  Reporting for Adverse Events  
All AEs occurring during the course of the study (starting from signing informed consent to the 
end of study) will be collected o n the AE eCRF.  Subjects should be instructed to report any AE 
that they experience to the Investigator.  Investigators should make an assessment for AEs at 
each visit and record the event on the appropriate AE eCRF.  
Wherever possible, a specific disease or syndrome rather than individual associated signs and 
symptoms should be identified by [CONTACT_76768] ; however, if an 
observed or reported sign or symptom is not considered a component of a  specific disease or 
syndrome by [CONTACT_737], it should be recorded as a separate AE on the eCRF.  Additionally, 
the condition that led to a medical or surgical procedure ( e.g., surgery, endoscopy, tooth 
extraction, transfusion) should be recorded as an AE, not the procedure.  
Any medical condition already present at screening or baseline should not be reported as an AE 
unless the medical condition or signs or symptoms present at baseline changes in severity or 
seriousness at any time during the study.  In this case, it should be reported as an AE.  
Clinically significant abnormal laboratory or other examination ( e.g., ECG) findings that are 
detected during the study or are present at baseline and significantly worsen during the study 
should be reported a s AEs.  The Investigator will exercise their medical and scientific judgment 
in deciding whether an abnormal laboratory finding,  or other abnormal assessment is clinically 
significant.  Significant abnormal laboratory values occurring during the clinical s tudy will be 
followed until repeat tests return to normal, stabilize, or are no longer clinically significant.  Any 
abnormal test that is determined to be an error does not require reporting as an AE.  
Analys es of certain AEs will be performed in this study  for reasons either associated with other 
lipid-lowering therapi[INVESTIGATOR_76740].  These

Confidential   Page 43 of 67 events include the following:  hepatic events , musculoskeletal events , diabetes and glycemia, 
hypoglycemia associated  with metabolic acidosis, renal impairment, neurocognitive events, atrial 
fibrillation, and tendon rupture/ tendinopathy.  
Each AE is to be evaluated for duration, severity, seriousness, and causal relationship to the IMP.  
For each AE, the following information will be recorded:  
• description of the event ( e.g., headache) ; 
• date of onset ; 
• date of resolution (or that the event is continuing) ; 
• action taken as a result of the event ; 
• seriousness of the event ; 
• severity of the event ; 
• outcome of the event ; and  
• Investigator’s assessment of relationship to IMP.  
A cluster of signs and symptoms that results from a single cause should be reported as a single 
AE ( e.g., fever, elevated white blood cells [WBC], cough, abnormal chest x -ray, et c., can all be 
reported as “pneumonia”).  
The Investigator will carefully evaluate the comments of the subject and the response to 
treatment in order that they may judge the true nature and severity of the AE.  The question of 
the relationship of AEs to IMP  administration should be determined by [CONTACT_76769].  
13.1.3  Severity  
It is the Investigator’s responsibility to assess the intensity (severity) of an AE.  
The severity of the AE w ill be characterized as mild, moderate, or severe according to the 
following definitions:  
• Mild:  Events are usually transient and do not interfere with the subject’s daily 
activities . 
• Moderate:  Events introduce a low level of inconvenience or concern to the subject 
and may interfere with daily activities . 
• Severe:  Events interrupt the subject’s usual daily activity, are incapacitating with 
inability to do usual activities, or significantly affect clinical status and warrant 
intervention and/or close follo w-up. 
Note:  a severe AE need not be serious and an SAE need not, by [CONTACT_108], be severe.

Confidential   Page 44 of 67 13.1.4  Relationship  
It is the Investigator’s responsibility to assess the relationship between the IMP and the AE.  The 
degree of “relatedness” of the AE to the IMP may be described using the following scale:  
• Not Related:  No temporal association ; other etiologies are likely the cause . 
• Unlikely:  While cannot be definitively ruled as not related to IMP, a causal 
association is remote, and other etiologies are more likely to be the cause.  For 
reporting and summarization, events assessed as Unlikely to be related to IMP will be 
considered as Not Related to IMP.  
• Possible:  Temporal association, but other etiologies are likely the cause ; however, 
involvement of the IMP cannot  be excluded.  
• Probable:  Temporal association, other etiologies are possible but unlikely.  The event 
may respond if the IMP is discontinued.  
• Definite:  Established temporal association with administration of the IMP with no 
other more probable cause.  Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], the event should resolve when the IMP is 
discontinued and recur on re -challenge.  
13.1.[ADDRESS_83590]’s source documentation.  Follow -up laboratory results should be filed 
with the subject’s source documentation.  
For all AEs that require the subject to be discontinued from the study, relevant clinical 
assessments and laborato ry tests must be repeated at appropriate intervals until final resolution or 
stabilization of the event(s).  
Subjects with AEs related to IMP that are ongoing at study discontinuation or completion must 
be followed until resolution or for [ADDRESS_83591], with 
the exception of subjects reporting SAEs  (Section  13.2.4). 
13.2 Serious Adverse Events  
13.2.1  Definition of Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is defined as any AE occurring at any dose that results in any of the following 
outcomes : 
• results in death ; 
• is life -threatening ; 
• requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] ; 
• results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or substantial disruption of the 
ability to conduct normal life functions ;

• an important medical event . 
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12475], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they 
may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed in this definition.  Examples of such medical events include allergic 
bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room, blood dyscrasias, 
convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or t he development of drug 
dependency or drug abuse.  
13.2.2  Events or Outcomes Not Qualifying as Serious Adverse Events  
The following are not considered SAEs and therefore do not need to be reported as such:  
• preplanned or elective hospi[INVESTIGATOR_76741] a nd/or convenience situations 
(e.g., due to inclement weather) , or 
• overdose of either Esperion IMP or concomitant medication unless the event meets 
SAE criteria ( e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) ; however, the event should still be captured as a 
nonserious AE on the a ppropriate eCRF page.  
13.2.[ADDRESS_83592] of reference ranges from the corresponding laboratory.  In some cases, 
significant changes in lab oratory  values within the normal range will require similar judgment.  
An abnormal laboratory value that is not already associated with an AE is to be recorded as an 
AE only if any one of t he following criteria is met:  
• an action on the IMP is made as a result of the abnormality ; 
• intervention for management of the abnormality is required ; or 
• at the discretion of the Investigator should the abnormality be deemed clinically 
significant .

14.1 General Considerations  
The statistical analysis described in this section will be performed as further outlined in a 
separate Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).  The SAP will supersede the protocol in the event of 
any difference between the [ADDRESS_83602] quartiles , minimum, and 
maximum.  Summary statistics for PK parameters will also include geometric mean and 
coefficient of Variation ( CV) (%).  For categorical variables, the frequency and percentage will 
be given.  
14.2 Determination of Sample Size  
A minimum sample size of 16 (8 subjects who receive  bempedoic acid [Cohort 1] and 8 subjects 
who receive bempedoic acid/ezetimibe FCDP  [Cohort 2] ) evaluable subjects (who complete the 
6-day treatment period and the [ADDRESS_83603] milk collection in the CRU) is planned for this 
study.  Subjects who are randomized but do not complete the [ADDRESS_83604] on the same treatment to ensure 8 evaluable 
subjects in each cohort for the final analyses.  
The sample size was not  based on empi[INVESTIGATOR_76744].  The sample size was 
based on clinical and regulatory considerations and pre cedence in previous ETC -1002 studies 
( ).  The sample size is considered sufficient to address the primary objective s of 
the study.  
14.3 Analysis Population  
14.3.1  Safety Population  
The Safety Population (SP), used for all the safety summaries, is define d as all subjects who  
received at least [ADDRESS_83605] milk collection 
after IMP administration on Day  6. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Primary Analyses  
• Daily infant dosage and RID of bempedoic acid  will be summarized for Cohort  1 
subjects who receive once daily bempedoic acid  for 6 consecutive days.  
• Daily infant dosage and RID of bempedoic acid and ezetimibe will be summarized 
for Cohort 2 subjects who received once daily bempedoic acid/ezetimibe FCDP for 
6 consecutive days.  
• RID will be calculated as the ratio of total infant dose per kg body weight a nd 
maternal dose per kg body weight , multiplied by 100 .

The PK parameters of bempedoic acid , ezetimibe , and metabolites (ESP15228 , bempedoic acid 
glucuronide , and ezetimibe -glucuronide) in mature breast milk will be calculated using stan dard 
noncompartmental methods , including : 
• breast milk AUC over the 24 -hour collection interval ; 
• average milk concentration based on milk AUC ; 
• peak and trough milk concentrations as well as time to reach peak milk 
concentrations ; and  
• plasma concentrations a t [ADDRESS_83606] dose on Day 6 . 
Pharmacokinetic calculations will be performed, if appropriate, using commercial software such 
as Phoenix ™ WinNonlin ® Version 6.4 or higher (Certara [LOCATION_003] Inc.).  
Descriptive statistics will be provided for the PK parameters.  
Other parameters may be added as appropriate; the final PK parameters reported will be detailed 
in the SAP.  
14.4 Safety Analyses  
General safety data in this study includes AEs, clinical laborator y parameters , PEs, vital signs , 
and body weight . 
Treat ment -emergent AEs (TEAEs) are defined as AEs that begin or worsen after randomization 
and the first dose of IMP through Day 13 .  TEAEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_1196] 
(SOC), Preferred Term, and severity.  Serious TEAEs, IMP-related TEAEs, TEAEs le ading to 
withdrawal of IMP, and deaths will be also summarized.  
Clinical laboratory parameters  including hematology and blood chemistry, PE  findings , vital 
signs, and body weight will be summarized and listed  using descriptive statistics.

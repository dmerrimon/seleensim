INTRODUCTION: 
 
You are being asked to volunteer as a subject in a research study being conducted at Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_268150] (the “Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]”) that involves genetic testing.  This consent form provides you 
with the information you will need when considering whether to participate in this research study 
and in the aspects of the study that relate to genetic testing. 
 
The
 researcher will explain the purpose of the study.  He or she will explain how the study will 
be carried out and what you will be expected to do.  The researcher will also explain the possible 
risks, possible benefits and alternatives of being in the study.  You should ask the researcher any 
questions you have about any of these things before you decide whether you wish to take part in 
the study.  If you decide to participate in this research study, you will be asked to sign and date 
this consent form, to indicate that you agree to participate.  This process is called informed 
consent.  You will be given a copy of this form to keep. 
 
1. STUDY PURPOSE – WHY IS THIS STUDY BEING DONE: 
 
R
esearchers at Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_268151] (RA) do after orthopedic surgery. The study will help us to identify 
early factors that may influence long-term outcomes of joint replacements in RA patients and 
determine how the condition behaves after surgery. This study aims to understand the reasons 
that some people experience a flare of RA after total joint replacement surgery and what the 
impact of flaring is over the year after the surgery. In this study we will regularly ask you about 
your RA, whether it has gotten worse, and whether you are able to achieve your goals in physical 
therapy. During the course of this study, we will also draw blood before and after surgery to 
better understand how RA behaves around the time of surgery and as you recuperate from your 
joint replacement. Based on your previous diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis and your upcoming 
surgery you are eligible to participate in this study. Your overall participation in this study will 
continue over the course of [ADDRESS_326556] Osteoarthritis 
(OA), or because you have another Inflammatory Arthritis (IA). Your participation will allow us 
to compare inflamed (sore) tissue to non-inflamed tissue. 
 
A secondary purpose of this study is to determine whether there is a genetic basis for worsening 
of rheumatoid arthritis, and if so, how genes function if rheumatoid arthritis worsens. Only by 
[CONTACT_268163] (those with OA), will we 
be able to determine if a given gene is truly linked to worsening of RA.

It is not the aim of this research study to provide you with clinically relevant genetic information 
that could be used to guide you or your physicians in making health care decisions.  Therefore, at 
the present time and during the course of the study, it is likely that we will not be able to provide 
you with any information regarding whether your rheumatoid arthritis will become active or 
worse. Genetic counseling, which is available for established genetic tests, is not offered through 
participation in this research study, as this is a research study and counseling for results of testin g 
in this study is not possible.  (We tell you this because [LOCATION_001] law requires us to advise you 
of the availability of genetic counseling prior to your signing this consent form and participating 
in this study.) 
 
The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the funding agency for this study through the 
Accelerating Medicines Partnership (AMP) initiative. The AMP initiative is a collaboration 
between the NIH, biopharmaceutical companies, and non-profit organizations. The goal of AMP 
is to increase the number of new diagnostics and therapi[INVESTIGATOR_39759], and to reduce the time 
and cost of developi[INVESTIGATOR_268152]. The AMP Network for Rheumatoid Arthritis 
is composed of various sites across the [LOCATION_002] and Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_268153] a part of 
thi
s network as a site.  
 
2. WHO  SHOULD NOT BE IN THE STUDY: 
 
You should not participate if you have recently had anemia.   
 
3. STUDY PROCEDURES – WHAT YOU WILL BE ASKED TO DO: 
I
f you decide to be part of this study, the following routine and/or experimental procedures will 
be performed:  
 
Clinical Data: 
 Upon enrolling we will give you a pre-operative questionnaire/survey containing 
questions about your demographic information (for example your race, ethnicity, age, 
weight), your medical history, your assessment of your joint function, and symptoms as 
they relate to your condition. Your responses will be coded to maintain your 
confidentiality. This survey should take about 30-60 minutes.  
 The  research staff will work with you to complete a second survey that will ask about 
your medical history and medication history. This survey should take about 5-10 minutes. 
 OA and IA Patients:  We will repeat both questionnaires at 6 weeks after surgery at the 
time of your regularly scheduled appointment. The surveys should take about 30  minutes. 
 RA  Patients only:   
 J ust before surgery and before you leave the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_268154]. Questions about your RA will also be asked by [CONTACT_67370] e-mailing an 
electronic survey each week for six weeks, and then once every three months for the rest 
of the year. These telephone or e-mail surveys should each take about [ADDRESS_326558] Approval  
9/4/2016 Thru 9/3/2017   All questionnaires can be completed in any of the following ways throughout the course 
of the study: in person at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], over the phone, via e-mail using a secure survey, or 
by [CONTACT_268164][INVESTIGATOR_307]. 
  
Blood sample: 
 RA &  IA Patients: During your surgery, a professional will draw a maximum of 4 
tablespoons (59 ccs) of blood from a vein in your ar m. At your 6 week and/or 12 month 
follow-up visits, a professional will draw a maximum of 2.5 tablespoons (36.5 ccs) of 
blood  from a vein in your arm.  
 OA P atients:  During your surgery, a professional will draw an additional 2.5 tablespoons 
(32.5 ccs) of blood. At your 6 week and 12 month follow-up visits a professional will 
draw a maximum of 1.5 tablespoons (20 ccs) of blood  from a vein in your arm.  
 All: In the event that you are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_268155] 6-week 
follow-up appointment with your surgeon, we may ask for an additional blood draw of 
20mL of blood to take place at the time of your routine morning blood draw.  
 If for any reason routine lab work is not required at your study visits, we would still 
require 2 tubes of blood for study purposes and would make arrangements to do so.   All 
samples will be de-identified. 
 
Surgical sample:     
 Dur ing your surgery, your surgeon will take samples of the tissue removed as part of your 
surgery from your operated joint. We will take this tissue and analyze it to learn more 
about the cellular activity that occurs with RA flare. We will also photograph the 
specimen using the Pathology Lab equipment. This photograph will be de-identified 
before it is used for research purposes.  If you choose not to participate in the study, this 
material will be discarded, which is what usually happens during total joint replacement 
surgery. 
 
As part of this study we will test blood and tissue specimens for genetic markers associated with 
RA. Genetic material (DNA & RNA) will be collected from your blood and surgical samples, 
and will be checked for genes related to RA. Blood and surgical samples will be shared with 
other investigators in the AMP network who have the expertise required to perform the 
molecular analyses. Each study subject will be assigned an identification number. Only this 
number will be used to identify the samples if the samples are transferred to other sites. 
 
 
4. STUDY RISKS – WHAT ADVERSE (BAD) EFFECTS CAN HAPPEN TO YOU BY 
P
ARTICIPATING IN THE STUDY: 
 
One additional risk from this study is that it may generate information about you or your 
family that could relate to your genetic predisposition to specific diseases or medical 
conditions.  Although every effort  will be made to ensure that any information about you 
will not be wrongly disclosed or used, there is always the possibility that it may be 
___________________

Form 10a 
Version dated 9-2- [ADDRESS_326559] Approval  
9/4/2016 Thru 9/3/2017  inadvertently disclosed, which could cause emotional distress to you or your family.  As 
described below, however, in the section entitled “Confidentiality and Privacy,” we will 
take major precautions to protect your medical information from being wrongly used or 
disclosed. 
Biological specimens including the blood and tissue that you contribute for this study will be 
maintained for as long as it is deemed useful for research purposes, after which time the 
specimen will be destroyed.  If your specimen is used for any future studies, it will either be 
completely stripped of any information that could be used to identify you, or it will be coded in 
such a way as to protect your identity, under the supervision of the Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]’s research review 
committee.  
 
You have the right to withdraw your consent to the storage and/or future genetic testing of your 
biological specimens at any time by [CONTACT_189188] [INVESTIGATOR_37105], [CONTACT_268189]. If you do so, any portion of your specimen that has not already been used for research 
purposes will be destroyed. Once your specimen has been stripped of all information that could 
identify you, however, it will not be possible to remove your specimen from those specimens 
that are stored for future research.  
 
If the Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], the Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]’s Institutional Review Board, and the company or government 
a
gency funding the research agree, study information, genetic information, and biological 
materials may be transferred to other hospi[INVESTIGATOR_268156].  This could happen if 
one or more of the investigators in this study relocates to another institution, or if HSS, in 
consultation with the investigators, believes that transferring these materials will allow important 
scientific research to be done.   
 
You should be aware that insurance companies sometimes use information on medical testing to 
evaluate whether a person should be able to purchase a life, health or disability insurance policy, 
and an insurance carrier may request, or condition benefits upon, disclosure by [CONTACT_268165].  Because this study likely will not provide you with any clinically 
meaningful genetic information about yourself, participation in this study should in no way affect 
your ability to obtain insurance coverage.  If asked by [CONTACT_268166], you should respond that it did not.   
 
The known effects, discomforts and foreseeable risks of physical, psychological, sociological, or 
other harm which you may reasonably expect to occur from being in this study are:  
 
You will be answering a survey.  There are very few risks in answering these questions. 
Likely:  Nothing bad will happen. 
L
ess likely:  Your private answers could be seen by [CONTACT_268167].  We 
have put in place all possible precautions to keep all your answers private.  Your answers will be 
kept locked up.  The people who work for this study are well trained and understand the 
importance of confidentiality and privacy.

9/4/2016 Thru 9/3/2017  Rarely:  You could be upset or embarrassed by a few of the questions.  We ask everyone these 
questions.  You don’t have to answer them if you don’t want to. 
 
There are certain risks and discomforts associated with blood draws for laboratory testing. 
Likely: The drawing of blood involves minor discomfort.  You may experience bruising and/or 
bleeding at the site of blood draw. 
Less likely: Occasionally some people experience dizziness or feel faint during a blood draw.  
There are risks of introducing infection with blood draws. 
 
5. T HERAPEUTIC OBJECTIVES: 
 
__X__ This study includes experimental/investigational procedures, which may not give you 
immediate or any benefits.  It is hoped the knowledge gained will be of benefit to others 
in the future. 
 
_____ This study is planned to select your treatment by [CONTACT_3364], since you will be assigned at 
random to one or more groups of people in the study who will receive different 
treatments, or no treatment.  It is not known if any treatment you receive will be of 
benefit to you.   
 
6. S TUDY BENEFITS: 
 
You are not expected to benefit personally from this research study.  Participation in this study 
will not provide you with any therapeutic benefits, nor will it provide you with information 
regarding whether you are genetically predisposed to developi[INVESTIGATOR_268157].  This 
study includes drawing blood for investigational procedures, which may not give you immediate 
benefit or any benefit.  The knowledge gained may benefit others in the future. 
Benefits for society may include providing further information about the genetic basis of 
worsening of rheumatoid arthritis as well as the development of safe and effective therapi[INVESTIGATOR_268158]. 
 
7. ALTERNATIVES TO PARTICIPATING IN THE RESEARCH STUDY:   
You
 are not required to participate in this study, and you have the alternative of not participating 
at all.  If you do not want to participate in the study, your decision will not affect in any way 
your ability to continue to receive care at the Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_268159]. 
 
8.    COSTS TO THE SUBJECT and COMPENSATION:  [ADDRESS_326561] health insurance, or if your health insurance does not pay for your medical care, you may 
seek financial assistance from HSS.  Eligibility determinations are made on a case- by-case basis

There are no charges or expenses associated with your participation in this study.  Nor will you 
receive money or any other form of compensation in return for such participation; participation is 
voluntary rather than paid.     
 
However, you will still be responsible for the cost of your medical care (which will be billed to 
you or your health insurance company), and for any co-pays, deductibles, and co-insurance 
associated with your medical care, just as you would be if you were not part of this study.  You 
will
 also be financially responsible for any costs of your medical care not covered by [CONTACT_86970] .   
 
Those
 research procedures listed in Section 3 will be covered by [CONTACT_268168]. 
  
The
re are no plans to compensate you for the use of the findings of this study, or any of the 
information or biologic materials (such as blood or tissue) collected from you during the study, 
even if they are used to develop or make a commercial product (such as a drug, device, biologic 
substance, or test).   
 
9. COMPENSATION FOR INJURY:   
 
All 
forms of medical diagnosis and treatment – including the drawing of blood or the collection 
of
 bodily tissues for this study – involve some risk of injury.  In spi[INVESTIGATOR_187492], there is a 
small
 chance that you might develop medical complications from participating in this study.  If 
such complications arise, the researchers will provide emergency medical treatment as necessary 
and will assist you in obtaining appropriate follow-up medical treatment, but this study does not 
provide compensation for additional medical or other costs. Additionally, The NIH will not 
compensate for research related injury.  
 
 
10. CONF IDENTIALITY and  PRIVACY: 
 
Any and all information about you obtained through this study, including any results of genetic 
testing, is private and confidential, and will not be disclosed, unless permitted or required by [CONTACT_268169].  If a disclosure of 
information is not authorized by [CONTACT_268170], that disclosure will not be made 
without your further written informed consent.   
 
                                                                                                                                                             
covered by [CONTACT_268171], which could be all of the costs (if HSS determines that you are 
not eligible for financial assistance) or some of the costs (if financial assistance awarded by [CONTACT_268172]).

9/4/2016 Thru 9/3/2017  Accelerating Medicines Partnership (AMP) research studies may share study samples and data 
with other research sites in the AMP Network for testing or storage. All samples and/or data 
collected from this study will be identified by a unique study ID number. A document linking 
you to your study ID number will be maintained by [CONTACT_079]. Your Protected 
Health Information (PHI), or certain information that identifies you, such as your name [CONTACT_268182], will never be shared with other AMP research sites and personal information from 
your records will not be released without your written permission. In the future, if any 
publications are written on analyses including your data, you will not be identified in these 
publications in any way. 
 
Your samples may be used for testing even after this study has been completed. Further research 
tests may help us learn more about your disease and response to drugs or treatment. However, 
future testing on your biological samples may be used for any type of biomedical research, which 
may or may not be related to the purpose of this study. The results of these future tests will not 
be shared with you. 
 
Study datasets with your health information may be shared with other AMP sites and deposited 
in AMP project data repositories for sharing with the broad biomedical research community.  
The purpose is to make study data available to other researchers as the value of these data 
increase when they are shared with the broader research community and not restricted in use to a 
particular disease or for a limited period of time.  Information from this study may be put into 
databases along with information from other studies.  These data will not include your name [CONTACT_268183].  The common databases may have different levels of 
accessibility – some databases may be open to the public, while others may only be accessed 
with 
the permission of a NIH Data Access Committee. Any personal information that could 
identify you will be removed before the data and/or results from this study are made available to 
other researchers or the public. These datasets may be used for any type of biomedical research, 
which may or may not be related to the purpose of this study. Many of these datasets are useful 
be
yond the specific aims of the study for which they were originally collected especially as 
various diseases turn out to have mechanisms in common.   
 
If you agree to take part in this study, some of your genetic and health information will be placed 
in a database called “dbGaP” that is maintained by [CONTACT_18121]. A researcher who wants to study the 
information must apply and be approved to use the database by a NIH Data Access Committee. 
These datasets may be used for any type of biomedical research, which may or may not be 
related to the purpose of this study. Many of these datasets are useful beyond the specific aims of 
the 
study for which they were originally collected especially as various diseases turn out to have 
mechanisms in common.   
 
Your privacy is important to us and we will use safety measures to protect your privacy.  In spi[INVESTIGATOR_268160], we cannot guarantee that your identity will never become 
known.  Although your genetic information is unique to you, you share some genetic information 
with your children, parents, brothers, sisters, and other blood relatives.  Consequently, it may be 
possible that genetic information from them could be used to help identify you.  Similarly, it may

information concerning non-paternity or non-maternity will not be divulged under any 
circumstances.   
 
W
hile we will not use information that is traditionally used to identify you, people may develop 
ways in the future that would allow someone to link your genetic or medical information in our 
databases back to you.   For example, someone could compare information in our databases with 
information from you (or a blood relative) in another database and be able to identify you (or 
your blood relative).  It is also possible there could be violations to the security of the computer 
systems used to store the codes linking your genetic and medical information to you.   There may 
also be other privacy risks that we have not foreseen. 
 
After your part in this study has been completed, we would like to be able to contact [CONTACT_10825], to get 
more information from you that may be needed for this research, to explain the results of this 
study, or to notify you of medical information that could help you or your family member.  You 
have the right, however, not to have us contact [CONTACT_268173].  The risks 
of allowing us to contact [CONTACT_268174], but the benefits are that we may have information that could help you in your medical 
planning and decision-making.  Please indicate below whether we have your permission to 
contact [CONTACT_10825] (and only you) in the future: 
 
 Yes, you may contact [CONTACT_268175], after my part in this study is over.  
 
 
  No, you may not contact [CONTACT_268175], after my part in this study is over.  
 
 
  Yes, you may ask my next of kin or the representative of my estate for consent to do 
further testing on my samples after my death and disclose the results to my family.  
 
  No, you may not ask my next of kin or the representative of my estate for consent to do  
further testing on my samples after my death and disclose the results to my family.  
 
If you allow us to contact [CONTACT_268176], we will not disclose your medical information, 
including any results of genetic tests done as part of the study, to any member of your family for 
clinical, research or any other purpose, without your further specific written informed consent. If 
we do think that your family members could benefit from knowing any information we have 
received about you during this study, we may ask you for permission to contact [CONTACT_476], and would 
explain our reason for wanting to do so.  But we will contact [CONTACT_268177] (other than you yourself) 
unless and until you specifically tell us to do so.   If you do not consent to be contact[CONTACT_45542], this also means that if you die and we later obtain information that might help your 
family, we would not be able to contact [CONTACT_268178]. 
 
If you consent to participate in this research, your personal information will not be released 
without your written permission, except as required by [CONTACT_268179][INVESTIGATOR_23047],

testing information to any insurance company unless you specifically tell us to do so).  If 
you agree to participate in this study, the researcher will ask for your separate written permission 
(on a form called an "authorization") to use and disclose your personal information for certain 
purposes related to the study.  For example, the researcher will ask permission to share your 
information with the research staff, with the Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]’s research review committee (known as the 
“Institutional Review Board”) and research oversight staff/government agencies that regulate 
research (OHRP and NY State), with other researchers and scientists working on this study, with 
your treating physicians or your other health care providers, and/or with any other people who 
need your personal information in order to conduct or oversee the study.  The researcher will 
also ask you to allow the sharing of your personal information with the research sponsor, and 
with those who help the research sponsor manage the study.  Your personal information will 
usually be shared on research forms without your name [CONTACT_29097], except 
when your name [CONTACT_268184].  Your name [CONTACT_268185]; only the data obtained as a result of your participation in this study will be 
made public.   
 
11. SAMPLES STORAGE AND SHARING INFORMATION 
 
We are asking your permission to store and share samples of biological specimens (e.g., blood, 
tissue, and urine) collected during the course of this study. Samples will be stored to be used in 
the future for tests that aren’t yet planned.  Such samples may also be shared with researchers at 
other Accelerated Medicines Partnership (AMP) sites during the course of the study for further 
testing and storage. The purpose of storage and sharing of samples and data is to make 
information and samples available to other researchers for use in health research.  Collecting, 
storing and sharing information and making it available for other studies may help people in the 
future.   These tests may or may not be related to the study of Rheumatoid Arthritis. 
 
Your stored samples may be used to obtain knowledge about genetic information in relation to 
your disease, related diseases, and/or the immune system.  Genetic tests study an individual’s 
inherited characteristics, found in DNA, which is present in each of the cells of your body.  DNA 
contains information needed to construct and operate the human body.   When we study the 
DNA from your blood samples, we will also generate data about your entire genetic code.   
 
Genetic tests may be performed on your blood and tissue samples to obtain knowledge about the 
way genetic information relates to your disease, related diseases, and/or the immune system. 
Genetic tests study your inherited characteristics, which are stored in the form of a “genetic 
code” in your DNA. A copy of your DNA is present in each of the cells in your body, and your 
cells read and interpret the genetic code to produce your inherited characteristics. Some of the 
genetic tests we plan to perform allow us to read your entire genetic code (Whole 
Genome/Exome Sequencing), while others let us look at the parts of your DNA your cells are 
reading and what parts they are ignoring (transcriptomics and epi[INVESTIGATOR_241188]). Some of the specific 
genetic tests we plan to use include “RNAseq,” “ChIPseq,” and “ATACseq.”

9/4/2016 Thru 9/3/[ADDRESS_326569] NOTIFICATION: 
 
HSS is concerned about possible conflicts of interest in research, and has policies that require all 
investigators and senior research staff to report to HSS significant financial interests (such as 
stock ownership, royalty payments, and consulting agreements) and relationships (such as 
membership on a scientific advisory board) that are related to their research studies.  When an 
investi
gator reports a significant financial interest or relationship that relates to one of his/her 
studies, HSS’s Conflict of Interest Committee for Research reviews the information to evaluate 
the risk that the interest or relationship might influence how the investigator conducts the study 
or interprets the results of the study.  HSS may also take steps to minimize that risk.   
 
 
 The Conflict of Interest Committee has determi ned that there are no 
conflicts associated with this study.  
 
 The Conflict of Interest Committee has determined that there is a potential 
conflict of interest.

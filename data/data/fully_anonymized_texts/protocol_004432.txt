Statistical 
Analyses The primary efficacy endpoint is the absolute change in ppFEV 1 from baseline at Week  4. The 
primary null hypothesis to be tested is that the mean absolute change in ppFEV 1 from baseline 
at Week 4 is the same for the TC and TEZ/IVA  treatment groups. The nul l hypothesis will be 
tested at a 2 -sided significance level of 0.05.  
Assuming a within- group SD of 7 percentage points and a 5% dropout rate at Week  4, a 
sample size of [ADDRESS_179770] 
approximately  93% power to detect a difference of 5.[ADDRESS_179771] at a significance level of 0.05.  
The primary analysis will be based  on a mixed -effects model for repeated measures (MMRM). 
The model will include the absolute change from baseline in ppFEV 1 at Day 15 and Week  4 as 
the dependent variable; treatment group, visit, and treatment -by-visit as fixed effects;  with 
continuous baseline ppFEV 1 and age at screening (<18 versus ≥18 years of age) as covariates; 
and an unstructured covariance structure for the within -subject errors.  
The primary result obtained from the model will be the estimated treatment difference at 
Week 4. The adjusted mean with a 2 -sided 95% CI and a 2- sided P value will be provided.  
The safety endpoints include AEs, clinical laboratory values, ECGs, vital signs, and pulse 
oximetry through the Safety Follow -up Visit. The safety analysis will be descriptive only.  
  
IDMC Reviews  An independent data monitoring committee (IDMC) will conduct safety review of study data 
as outlined in the IDMC charter.

Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   5 INTRODUCTION  
5.1 Background  
Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive  chronic disease with serious morbidities and 
frequent premature mortality. At present, there is no cure. CF affects approximately 
70,000 individuals worldwide1 (approximately 30,000 in the US1,2 and 39,000 in the EU3). Based 
on its prevalence, CF qualifies as an orphan disease .4, 5  
CF is caused by [CONTACT_155412]/or function of the CFTR protein due to mutations in the CFTR gene. The CFTR protein is an epi[INVESTIGATOR_155386], including the lungs, pancreas, and other gastrointestinal organs. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_155387], the predicted median age of survival for a person with CF is approximately [ADDRESS_179783] common disease- causing CFTR mutation, F508del , accounts for 70% of the identified 
alleles in people w ith CF8, and approximately 40% of people with CF are homozygous for 
F508del (F/F) .2, 3, [ADDRESS_179784] been developed to address the decreased quantity and/or function of CFTR in order to enhance chloride transport in patients with CF. Correctors facilitate the cellular processing and trafficking to increase the quantity of functional CFTR at the cell surface. Potentiators increase the channel open probability of the CFTR  protein delivered to the 
cell surface to enhance ion transport. Depending on the amount of residual CFTR channel 
activity in the membrane, and the pathophysiology of that activity (reflecting the CFTR genotype 
of the patient and possibly other factors), both approaches may be required. 
The therapeutic activity of CFTR correctors and potentiators has been established with products 
that were developed by [CONTACT_155413]: ivacaftor (IVA) monotherapy (Kalydeco
®), and lumacaftor (LUM) in combination with IVA (Orkambi®). 
Kalydeco and Orkambi are approved to treat CF in patients with specific CFTR genotypes. A 
second corrector/potentiator combination, tezacaftor (TEZ)/IVA (Symdeko®) is approved in 
certain countries.  
VX-445 is a next-generation CFTR corrector being developed for administration in triple combination (TC) with TEZ/IVA for the treatment of CF.  
5.2 Rationale for the Present Study  
This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of VX -445 in TC with TEZ/IVA in subjects with 
CF who have an F/F genotype. These patients have continuing unmet need despi[INVESTIGATOR_155388]. The potential for benefit in these patients is supported by [CONTACT_155414] F/F subjects; in addition, the TC of VX-445/TEZ/IVA is generally safe 
and well tolerated (refer to VX -445 Investigator’s Brochure).

Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   [IP_ADDRESS] Repetition of Screening Assessment(s)  
Screening assessments may be repeated once to establish study eligibility.  If repeat values of the 
individual assessment(s) are within the eligibility criteria and completed within the screening 
window, then the subject is eligible for the study. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Rescreening  
Subjects may be rescreened once. If a subject is rescreened, all screening assessments will be 
repeated, except for:  
• CFTR genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007] 
• Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) level (if serum FSH level was in the postmenopausal 
range as determined by [CONTACT_155416]) 
• G6PD activity test  
• Ophthalmologic examination (if performed within 3 months of the date of informed consent, for subjects <18 years of age)  
If a subject is rescreened, a new screening window will begin when the first rescreening assessment has been initiated.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Extension of Screening Period Window  
A subject may have the Screening Period window extended by 2 weeks for the following reasons: 
• Repetition of the Screening Period assessments (Section  [IP_ADDRESS]) 
• Unexpected operational or logistic delays, or to meet the eligibility criteria  
• Scheduling of ophthalmologic examination (for subjects <18 years of age on the date of 
informed consent, Section 11.7.6)  
9.1.2 Tezacaftor/Ivacaftor Run -in Period 
The TEZ/IVA Run -in Period has a 4-week duration and is designed to establish a reliable 
on-treatment (TEZ/IVA) baseline for the Treatment Period. The first dose of open -label 
TEZ/IVA will be administered at the Day -[ADDRESS_179793] dose of open- label TEZ/IVA will be 
administered in the evening on Day -1 (1 day before the Day 1 Visit).  
On Day -14, spi[INVESTIGATOR_155391]. The Day -14 spi[INVESTIGATOR_155392] ( Section 9.2).

Female subjects of childbearing potential also must have a negative pregnancy test at Day 1 before receiving randomized study drug. If these conditions are not met (for example, if the subject has an acute upper or lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_4416], PEx, or changes in therap y 
[including antibiotics] for sinopulmonary disease within 28 days before the Day 1 Visit [first dose of study drug in the Treatment Period]), the subject is considered a run-in failure and cannot enter the Treatment Period or rescreen.  
Subjects who prema turely discontinue study drug treatment during the Treatment Period will 
remain in the study from the time of discontinuation of study drug treatment through the last scheduled study visit and complete the assessments for all study visits, as described in Section [IP_ADDRESS]. 
9.1.[ADDRESS_179796] prematurely discontinues study drug treatment, an Early Termination of Treatment 
(ETT) Visit should be scheduled as soon as possibl e after the decision to discontinue treatment. 
Subjects who prematurely discontinue treatment will also be required to complete the Safety Follow-up Visit, approximately [ADDRESS_179797] withdraws from the study and also withdraws consent or assent, no further 
assessments will be performed. Vertex may retain and continue to use any data and samples collected before such withdrawal of consent or assent. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Discontinuation During the Run- in Period  
Subjects who prematurely discontinue study drug treatment during the Run-in Period will not be 
randomized or participate in the Treatment Period. The se subjects will complete an ETT Visit 
and Safety Follow- up Visit (as applicable; see Section  9.1.5). The Safety Follow- up Visit will be 
their last visit in the study.

• The subject does not respond within [ADDRESS_179799] is defined as one of the following: • For subjects who complete the Treatment Period and enter an open- label study within 
28 days of the Week  4 Visit: the Week  4 Visit 
• For subjects who complete the Treatment Period and do not enter an open- label study within 
28 days of the Week  4 Visit: the Safety Follow -up Visit 
• For subjects who prematurely discontinue study drug treatment during the Treatment Period 
but do not withdraw consent (and assent, as appli cable): The ETT or Safety Follow -up Visit 
(if required)  
• For subjects who prematurely discontinue study drug treatment during the TEZ/IVA Run-in Period but do not withdraw consent (and assent, as applicable): the ETT or Safety Follow-up 
Visit (if required)  
• For subjects who withdraw consent or assent: date of withdrawal of consent or assent, 
whichever is earlier (Section 9.9) 
If subjects are lost to follow -up (Section 9.1.6), the date of completion of study participation  will 
be defined as the date of the last contact.  
The end of study is defined in  Section 13.2.8. 
9.1.8 Independent Data Monitoring Committee  
This study will be monitored by [CONTACT_82571] (IDMC), which wil l 
conduct periodic reviews of safety data from the study ( Section [IP_ADDRESS]). Procedural details of 
the IDMC structure and function, frequency of meetings, and data planned for review will be 
included in the IDMC charter. The IDMC charter will be finalized before the first subject is screened. 

Protocol VX17-445-103, Version 3.0 Page 27 of 67 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   9.2 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups  
Subjects will be randomized (1:1) to the TC VX- 445/TEZ/ IVA arm or to the TEZ/IVA arm. 
Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_66763] 1 determined during the TEZ/IVA Run-in Period 
(Day -14 assessment; <70  versus ≥70) and age at the Screening Visit (<18 versus ≥18 years of 
age). If the Day -[ADDRESS_179800] recent available ppFEV 1 
value will be used for stratification.  
An interactive web response system (IWRS)  will be used to assign subjects to treatment. The 
randomization code list will be produced by [CONTACT_155418] a qualified randomization 
vendor. 
9.3 Rationale for Study Design and Study Drug Regimens  
9.3.1 Study Design 
This Phase 3 study will assess the efficac y, PD, safety, and PK of VX-445/TEZ/IVA TC therapy 
in subjects with CF who have an F/F genotype. 
A randomized, double-blind, controlled study design was selected to ascertain the effects of 
VX-445/TEZ/ IVA while avoiding observer bias. TEZ/IVA is considered  an appropriate active 
control since the efficacy and safety of TEZ/IVA in F/F subjects have been demonstrated in Study VX14-661-106 (Study 661-106) .
14 Study 661-106 met its primary endpoint of absolute 
change in ppFEV 1 through Week 24, with a 4.0 percentage point treatment differe nce between 
TEZ/IVA and placebo. In Study 661- 106, TEZ/IVA was well tolerated and no safety concerns 
attributable to TEZ/IVA were identified.  
A 4-week TEZ/IVA Run -in Period was incorporated into this study to establish a reliable 
on-treatment (TEZ/IVA) bas eline for comparison during the Treatment Period. 
The study will have a 4 -week treatment duration because previous studies of CFTR modulators 
(IVA, LUM/IVA, and TEZ/IVA) have demonstrated that efficacy related to lung function (ppFEV
1) can be reliably established using an endpoint at Week 4. In these studies, rapid 
improvements in ppFEV [ADDRESS_179801]’s ppFEV 1 value 
(an index of disease severity) b efore the start of TC study drug dosing. Some subjects in this 
study may be receiving treatment with LUM/IVA or TEZ/IVA at Screening, while some subjects 
may not be receiving treatment with CFTR modulators. Therefore, randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_155419]
1 value determined during the TEZ/IVA Run-in Period after at least 13 days 
of TEZ/IVA (Day -14 assessment). Randomization will also be stratified by [CONTACT_21406]. 
This will ensure a balanced evaluation of adult and pediatric subjects.  
9.3.2 Study Drug Dose 
VX-445 Dosage 
A VX-445 dose of 200 mg qd was selected for the current study based on an assessment of the 
benefit-risk profile from the ongoing Phase 2 Study VX16-445-001 (Study 445-001) Parts D and 
E. In Study 445-001 Part D, a range of VX-445 doses (50 mg qd, 100 mg qd, and 200 mg qd) in

9.[ADDRESS_179803]’s source documentation for medications taken within 56 days before the Screening Visit through completion of study participation, as defined in Section 9.1.7. 
For subjects who are screened but are not subsequently randomized into the Treatment Period, 
details of prior medication will be documente d only in the subjects’ source documents. 
• Subjects should remain on a stable treatment regimen for their CF from 28 days before the 
TEZ/IVA Run -in/Day -[ADDRESS_179804] 28  days before the TEZ/IVA Run- in/Day -28. Subjects may remain on Vertex 
CFTR modulators (investigational or approved) during the Screening Period and may 
transition directly to the TEZ/IVA R un-in/Day -28 without a washout ( Table 9-2). Subjects 
should not initiate long- term treatment with new medication from 28  days before the 
TEZ/IVA Run -in/Day -28 through completion of study participation . Guidelines for stable 
treatment regimens for CF are as follows:  
o Subjects who are taking inhaled tobramycin or other chronically inhaled antibiotics should remain on that regimen throughout the study. 
o Subjects who cycle onto and off of an inhaled antibiotic should continue on their prior schedule. The timing of the first dose of study drug on the Day 1 Visit should be synchronized as closely as possible (e.g., not more than ± 3 days) to the first day in the cycle onto the inhaled antibiotic. 
o Subjects who alternate between [ADDRESS_179805] dose of study drug on the Day 1 Visit should be synchronized as closely as possible (e.g., not more than 
± 3 days) to the first day in the cycle onto 1 of the inhaled antibiotics. 
• Subjects may receive doses of prednisone or prednisolone of up to 10 mg/day chronically, or 
up to 60 mg daily for up to 5 days.

meal or snack or a standard meal.  
1. It is recommended that the dose be taken within 30 minutes of the start of the meal or snack. 
2. Study drug will b e administered as fixed -dose combination (FDC) tablet(s) (e.g., 2 TC or 
matching placebo tablets; 1 TEZ/IVA or matching placebo tablet) in the morning and as [ADDRESS_179807], doses of study drugs will be taken at approximately  the same time (±  2 hours) each day. 
3. The date, amount taken, and time of study drug administration, including whether food was taken with each dose, will be recorded for the 2 doses before PK sample collection and the dose received on the morning of PK sam ple collection (if applicable).  
4. On days of scheduled visits, the morning dose of study drug (TC, TEZ/IVA, or placebo) will be administered at the site after predose assessments have been completed. A meal or snack will be provided by [CONTACT_155420], TEZ/IVA, or placebo. 
5. If a subject’s scheduled visit is to occur in the afternoon, the following guidelines must be used: 
• If the dose in the clinic will be within [ADDRESS_179808]’s scheduled morning dose, 
the subject should withhold their morning dose of TC, TEZ/IVA, or placebo and the 
morning dose will be administered in the clinic.  
• If the dose in the clinic will be more than [ADDRESS_179809]’s scheduled morning 
dose, the subject should take the morning dose of TC, TEZ/IVA, or placebo at home.  
• At the Day  15 Visit, the morning dose of TC, TEZ/IVA, or placebo must be administered 
in the clinic to enable post- dose ECG assessments relative to the dose. 
6. Subjects will be instructed to bring all used and unused materials associated with the study drug to the site; study drug will be dispensed at each visit, as appropriate.  
9.6.2 Missed Doses  
[IP_ADDRESS] Morning Dose of Study Drug  
If a subject misses the morning dose of study drug (TC, TEZ/IVA, or placebo) and recalls within [ADDRESS_179810] should take his/her dose with food. If more than [ADDRESS_179811] elapsed after his/her usual dosing time, the subject should take the morning dose of TC, TEZ/IVA, or placebo but skip the evening dose of study drug (IVA). If more than [ADDRESS_179812] elapsed after his/her usual dosing time, the subject should skip the morning dose of TC, TEZ/IVA, or placebo and take the evening dose of IVA.

Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   [IP_ADDRESS] Evening Dose of Stud y Drug 
If a subject misses the evening dose of IVA and recalls within [ADDRESS_179813] should take 
his/her dose with food. If more than [ADDRESS_179814] elapsed after his/her usual dosing time, the subject should skip that dose and resume his/her normal schedule for the following dose.  
9.7 Dose Modification for Toxicity  
No dose modifications for toxicity are allowed. Treatment may be interrupted as outlined in 
Section 9.8. If any unacceptable toxicity arises, individual subjects will discontinue dosing 
(Section 9.1.5). 
9.8 Study Drug Interruption and Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_155394] >[ADDRESS_179815] >3 × ULN and total 
bilirubin >2 × ULN that are derived from centrally submitted samples.  
Subjects with new treatment -emergent ALT or AST elevations of >3  × ULN, with or without 
total bilirubin >2  × ULN, must be followed closely, including confirmatory testing performed by 
[CONTACT_66768] [ADDRESS_179816] the tests repeated and sent to the central laboratory as soon as possible (ideally within 48 to 72 hours). 
Study drug administra tion must be interrupted immediately (prior to confirmatory testing) if 
any of the following criteria are met: 
• ALT or AST >8  × ULN 
• ALT or AST >5  × ULN for more than 2 weeks  
• ALT or AST >3  × ULN, in association with total bilirubin >2  × ULN and/or clinical j aundice 
A thorough investigation of potential causes should be conducted, and the subject should be followed closely for clinical progression. 
Study drug administration must be discontinued if the following criterion is met:  
• Subsequent ALT or AST values confirm the initial elevation that satisfied the interruption 
rule (above), and no convincing alternative etiology (e.g., acetaminophen use, viral hepatitis, 
alcohol ingestion) is identified, regardless of whether transaminase levels have improved 
All subjec ts in whom treatment is discontinued for elevated transaminases (and bilirubin, as 
applicable) should have these levels monitored closely until levels normalize or return to baseline. 
If an alternative, reversible cause of transaminase elevation with or wi thout increased bilirubin or 
clinical jaundice has been identified , study drug administration may be resum ed once

Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   transaminases  return to baseline or are ≤2 × ULN, whichever is higher. Regardless of the 
duration of interruption, the medical monitor should be notified prior to resumption of study 
drug. Upon resumption of study drug, transaminases and bilirubin should be assessed weekly for 4 weeks. If a protocol-defined transaminase elevation interruption threshold recurs within 4 weeks of rechallenge with t he study drug (with confirmation of the initial elevation by [CONTACT_155421] 48  to 72 hours), then the study drug must be permanently discontinued, regardless 
of the presumed etiology.  
9.8.[ADDRESS_179817] develops a generalized rash of Grade 3 or higher, or a rash that is considered a serious adverse event. The investigator will notify the medical monitor of any rash that results in interruption of study drug, is Grade 3 or higher ( Section [IP_ADDRESS]), or is a serious 
adverse event (SA E). Investigators should consider additional evaluation including laboratory 
testing (e.g., complete blood count [CBC] with differential, LFTs), photographs of the rash, and dermatology consultation. The investigator may consider resumption of study drug i f considered 
clinically appropriate.  
9.[ADDRESS_179818] has not withdrawn consent (and assent, as applicable). 
In addition, a subject must be discontinued from study drug treatment if the subject meets any of 
the following criteria:  
• Has a screening CFTR genotype that does not confirm study eligibility if a previous CFTR 
genotype laboratory report was used to establish  eligibility. These subjects must be 
discontinued from the study ( Section 8.1) 
• Meets any of the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007] (discontinuation) criteria ( Section 9.8) 
• Becomes pregnant (S ection [IP_ADDRESS]) 
Subjects who discontinue study drug treatment should return for study assessments, as noted in 
Section [IP_ADDRESS]. 
If a subject does not return for a scheduled visit, reasonable effort will be made to contact [CONTACT_1560]. In any circumstance, reasonable effort will be made to document subject outcome. The investigator will inquire about the reason for withdrawal, request that the subject return all unused investigational product(s), request that the subject return for an ETT Visit and Safety Follow-up Visit, if applicable (see Section 9.1.5), and follow up with the subject regarding any 
unresolved AEs.  
If the subject withdraws consent or assent for the study, no further assessments will be performed. Vertex may retain and continue using the study data and samples after the study is over, and may use the samples and information in the development of the study compound, and for other drugs and diagnostics, in publications and presentations, and for education purposes.

Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   10.7.1 Blinding 
All subjects (and their parents/caregivers/companions), site personnel (including the investigator, 
the site monitor, and the study team), and members of the Vertex study team will be blinded to the treatment codes.  
Individuals who may be unblinded include only the following: 
• Any site personnel for whom this information is important to ensure the safet y of the subject 
in the event of a life- threatening medical emergency  
• Any site personnel for whom this information is important to ensure the safety of the subject 
and her fetus in the event of a pregnancy 
• Vertex Global Patient Safety (GPS) and Regulatory Affairs personnel to satisfy SAE processing and reporting regulations 
• Vendor preparing the final (production) randomization list 
• Vertex IWRS Manager  
• Vertex Clinical Supply Chain  
• IDMC 
• Vendor preparing the unblinded analysis of safety data for review by [CONTACT_31849]  
• Bioanalytical contract research organization (CRO) analyzing PK samples and the Vertex Bioanalytical personnel who is not a member of the study team but reviews raw data from the 
Bioanalytical CRO. The Vertex Bioanalytical study team  member will continue to be 
blinded. 
Access to Spi[INVESTIGATOR_155395] : 
During the conduct of the study, the Vertex study team will not have access to the spi[INVESTIGATOR_155396] t dose of study drug in the Treatment Period.  
Shortly before any planned efficacy analysis is conducted, the spi[INVESTIGATOR_155397] a biostatistician who does not have access to the treatment codes.

Pregnancy (β-human chorionic gonadotropin) Tests for Females of Childbearing Potential: Any 
female subject who does not meet the criteria for non -childbearing potential is considered to be 
of childbearing potential and must have a serum pregnancy test at screening. A definition of 
non-childbearing potential is provided in Section [IP_ADDRESS]. Serum pregnancy tests will be 
performed at the study site and analyzed at the central laboratory. Urine pregnancy tests will be performed and analyzed at the site. The urine pregnancy test on Day -[ADDRESS_179833] dose of study drug in the study period. Additional pregnancy tests may be required according to local regulations and/or requirements. 
FSH (Screening Period Only): Blood samples for FSH will be measured for any suspected 
postmenopausal female with at least [ADDRESS_179834].  
CFTR Genotype (Screening Period Only):  CFTR genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_14441]. 
If the screening CFTR genotype result is not received before Day -28, a previous CF TR genotype

9.9). 

Protocol VX17-445-103, Version 3.[ADDRESS_179835] (Screening Period Only) : A blood sample will be collected for a quantitative 
G6PD activity assay, which will be performed in an established laboratory that runs the assay 
routinely. The use of a local laboratory that routinely runs the assay is permissible following approval by [CONTACT_7195].  
Additional Evaluations: Additional clinical laboratory evaluations will be performed at other 
times if judged to be clinicall y appropriate.  
For the purposes of study conduct and unless noted otherwise (e.g., G6PD activity test), only laboratory tests done in the central laboratory may be used. Local laboratories may be used at the discretion of the local investigator for manage ment of urgent medical issues. If a local laboratory 
test value is found to be abnormal and clinically significant, it will be verified by [CONTACT_94295]. If it is not possible to send a timely specimen to the central laboratory (e.g., the subject was hospi[INVESTIGATOR_94248]), the investigator may base the assessment of an AE on the local laboratory value.  
11.7.[ADDRESS_179836] study visits (see  Table 3-1 and Table 3-2 ). At other visits, symptom-directed PEs and 
symptom- directed vital sign assessments will occur at any time if deemed necessary by [CONTACT_155424]. 
A complete PE includes  a review of the following systems: head, neck, and thyroid; eyes, ears, 
nose, and throat (EENT); respi[INVESTIGATOR_696]; cardiovascular; lymph nodes; abdomen; skin; 
musculoskeletal; and neurological. Breast, anorectal, and genital examinations will be performed when medically indicated. After screening, any clinically significant abnormal findings in PEs 
will be reported as AEs.  
The abbreviated PE will include an assessment of the following body systems: EENT, cardiovascular system, respi[INVESTIGATOR_2133], skin, and abdomen.  
Vital signs include blood pressure (systolic and diastolic), temperature (oral), pulse rate, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487]. These will be assessed before dosing and following at least a 5- minute rest. 
11.7.[ADDRESS_179837] and before study drug dosing. At visits when 
study drug is taken at the site, pulse oximetry will be collected before study drug dosing (Section 9.6.1).  
11.7.[ADDRESS_179838] 12-lead ECGs will be performed using a machine with printout according to the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 3-1 and Table 3-2). Additional standard 12- lead ECGs will be 
performed at any other time if clinically indicated. Subjects will be instructed to rest for at least 5 minutes before having an E CG performed.  
The ECG traces will be manually read at the study site. A printout of the ECG traces will be made for safety review by [CONTACT_94297]. Clinically

Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   significant ECG abnormalities occurring during the study through completion of study 
participation  will be recorded as AEs.  
To ensure the safety of the subjects, a qualified individual at the study site will make comparisons to baseline measurements. If the QTcF is increased by >60  msec from the baseline 
or an absolute QTcF value is ≥500 msec for any scheduled ECG, 2 additional ECGs will be 
performed approximately 2 to 4 minutes apart to confirm the original measurement. If either of the QTcF values from these repeated ECGs remains above the threshold value (>60  msec from 
baseline or ≥500 msec), a single ECG will be repeated at least hourly until QTcF values from 2 successive ECGs fall below the threshold value that triggered the repeat measurement. Further details pertaining to ECGs will be provided to sites in the ECG Manual. 
11.7.6 Ophthalmologic  Examination 
Ophthalmologic examinations will be conducted at screening only for subjects who are <[ADDRESS_179839] and will include  
• measurement of best -corrected distance visual acuity of each eye; and  
• pharmacologically dilated examination of the lens with a slit lamp.  
The screening examination does not need to be conducted if there is documentation of an 
examination meeting the protocol requirements that was conducted within 3 months before the date of informed consent.  
Any clinically significant ab normal findings will be reported as AEs. 
For subjects who subsequently enroll in an open-label study, follow-up ophthalmologic 
examinations will be performed as per that study’s protocol.

12 STATISTICAL AND ANAL YTICAL PLANS  
This section presents a summary of the planned  analyses for this protocol. Statistical analysis 
details will be provided in the statistical analysis plan (SAP), and clinical pharmacologic analysis details will be provided in the clinical pharmacology analysis plan (CPAP), both of which will be finalized before the clinical data lock for the study and treatment unblinding.  
12.1 Sample Size and Power  
The primary efficacy endpoint is the absolute change in ppFEV
1 from baseline at Week  4. The 
primary null hypothesis to be tested is that the mean absolute change in ppFEV 1 from baseline at 
Week 4 is the same for the TC and TEZ/IVA  treatment groups. The null hypothesis will be tested 
at a 2-sided significance level of  0.05. 
Assuming a within -group SD of 7 percentage points and a 5% dropout rate at Week 4, a sample 
size of [ADDRESS_179850] approximately 93% power to detect a difference of 5.[ADDRESS_179851] at a significance level of 0.05  
12.2 Analysis Sets  
The following analysis sets are defined: Al l Subjects Set, Full Analysis Set (FAS), and Safety 
Set. Additional analysis sets related to the Run -in Period will be defined in the SAP, as 
appropriate. 
The All Subjects Set  will include all subjects who were randomized or received at least [ADDRESS_179852] 1  dose of study drug in the 
Treatment Period. The Safety Set will be used for all safety analyses in which subjects will be 
analyzed according to the treatment they received, unless otherwise specified.  
12.3 Statistical Analysis  
12.3.1 General Considerations  
Continuous variables  will be summarized using the following descriptive summary statistics: 
the number of subjects (n), mean, SD, median, minimum value (min), and maximum value (max). The precision of the measurement for each continuous variable will be specified in the SAP. Unless otherwise specified, min and max values will be reported with the same precision as 
the units of the raw data. The mean, median, and SD will be reported to [ADDRESS_179853] units (metric or SI) will be converted with the appropriate precision. 
Categorical variables  will be summarized using counts and percentages. Percentages will be 
presented to [ADDRESS_179854] recent non -missing 
measurement (scheduled or unscheduled) collected before the first dose of study drug in the 
Treatment Period (i.e., the Day 1 Visit). For ECG, baseline will be defined as the most recent pretreatment measurement (or the average of triplicate measurements, if the most recent pretreatment measurement is obtained in triplicate) before the first dose of study drug in the Treatment Period (i.e., the Day 1 Visit).  
Absolute change  from baseline will be calculated as post -baseline value – baseline value.  
The Treatment -emergent (TE) Period for the Run -in Period  will be from the first dose date 
of study drug in the Run-in Period to (1) the first dose date of study drug in the Treatment Period for subjects who complete the Run-in Period and continue to the Treatment Period, or (2) [ADDRESS_179855], for subjects who do not continue to the Treatment Period (e.g., subjects who do not meet the conditions to enter the Treatment Period).  
The TE Period for the Treatment Period  will include the time from the first dose date of study 
drug in the Treatment Period (TC or placebo + TEZ/IVA) to [ADDRESS_179856] dose of the study drug or to the completion of study participation date (as defined in  Section 9.1.7), 
whichever occurs first.  
12.3.2 Background Characteristics  
[IP_ADDRESS] Subject Disposition  
The number and percentage of subjects in each disposition category (e.g., randomized, included in the FAS, included in the Safety Set, completed Treatment Period, completed study, prematurely discontinued treatment or study with a breakdown of the reasons for discontinuation, and entered an open- label study) will be summarized overall and by [CONTACT_6490]. 
An additional subject disposition summary related to the TEZ/IVA Run-in Period will be defined 
in the SAP, as appropriate.

Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   [IP_ADDRESS] Demographics and Baseline Ch aracteristics  
Demographic, medical history, and baseline characteristics will be summarized using descriptive 
summary statistics.  
The following demographics and baseline characteristics will be summarized overall and by [CONTACT_64207], and will include (but are not limited to): sex, race, baseline age, baseline weight, baseline height, baseline BMI, baseline ppFEV
1, and baseline SwCl.  
Medical history will be summarized by [CONTACT_7204] (SOC) and Preferred Term (PT) for the FAS.  
No statistical tests will be performed to evaluate baseline imbalance between treatment groups . 
[IP_ADDRESS] Prior and Concomitant Medications  
Medications will be coded using the World Health Organization Drug -Dictionary and 
categorized as follows:  
• Prior medication : any medication that was administered during the [ADDRESS_179857] dose in the Run-in Period 
• Concomitant medication during the Run- in Period : medication continued or newly 
received during the TE Period for the Run-in Period  
• Concomitant medication during the Treatment Period : medication continued or newly 
received during the TE Period for the Treatment Period  
• Post-treatment medication : medication continued or newly received after: 
o the TE Period for the Run-in Period if the subject did not receive study drug in the 
Treatment Period  
o the TE Period for the Treatment Period for subjects who received study drug in the Treatment Period  
A given medication may be classified as a prior medication, a concomitant medication, or a 
post-treatment medication; both prior and concomitant; both concomitant and post- treatment; or 
prior, concomitant, and post- treatment. If a medication has a missing or partially missing 
start/end date or time and if it cannot be determined whether it was taken before the first dose of study drug, concomitantly during the TE Period, or after the TE Period, it will be considered in all [ADDRESS_179858] data listing. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Study Drug Exposure and Compliance  
Study drug exposure and compliance will be summarized for the Treatment Period only. 

Protocol VX17-445-103, Version 3.[ADDRESS_179859] received (in days), defined as the last day – the 
first day of study drug plus 1, regardless of study drug interruption. 
Study drug compliance will be summarized overall and by [CONTACT_155426], 
and will be calculated as: 100 × [1- (total number of days of study drug interruption) / (duration 
of study drug exposure in days)]. A study drug interruption on a given day is defined as an interruption of any study drug on that day. 
In addition, percentage of tablets taken will also be summarized overall and by [CONTACT_155427], and will be calculated as 100 × [(total number of tablets dispensed for the Treatment Period) – (total number of tablets returned for the Treatment Period)] / (total number 
of tablets plan ned to be taken per day × duration of study drug exposure in days for the 
Treatment Period).  
[IP_ADDRESS] Important Protocol Deviations  
An important protocol deviation (IPD) is a deviation that may significantly affect the completeness, accuracy, or reliability of the study data or that may significantly affect a subject’s 
rights, safety, or well-being. The rules for identifying an IPD will be described in the SAP. 
All IPDs will be provided in an individual subject data listing and summarized, as appropriate. 
12.3.3 Efficacy a nd Pharmacodynamic Analyses 
The primary objective of the study is the evaluation of the efficacy of VX-445 in TC with TEZ 
and IVA. The analysis in this section will be based on the FAS, unless otherwise specified. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Analysis of Primary Variable  
The primary efficacy variable is the absolute change in ppFEV
1 from baseline at Week  4. The 
analysis of this variable will be performed using a mixed -effects model for repeated measures 
(MMRM) with absolute change from baseline in ppFEV 1 at Day 15 and Week 4 as the dep endent 
variable. The model will include treatment group, visit, and treatment- by-visit interaction as 
fixed effects, with continuous baseline ppFEV 1 and age at screening (<18  versus ≥18 years of 
age) as covariates. The model will be estimated using restricted maximum likelihood. 
Denominator degrees of freedom for the F  test for fixed effects will be estimated using the 
Kenward-Roger approximation. An unstructured covariance structure will be used to model the 
within-subject errors. If the model estimation does not converge, a compound symmetry 
covariance structure will be used instead. Conditional on the observed data and covariates, missing data will be assumed to be missing at random; consequently, no imputation of missing data will be performed.  
The prima ry result obtained from the model will be the estimated treatment difference at Week  4. 
The adjusted mean with a 2 -sided 95% CI and a 2-sided P  value will be provided. Furthermore, 
the treatment difference at each post -baseline visit will also be provided, obtained from the 
model. 
Sensitivity analyses for handling missing data will be described in the SAP.  
Supportive analyses and subgroup analyses by [CONTACT_155428].

The overall safety profile of study drug will be assessed based on the following safety and tolerability endpoints: 
• Treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs)  
• Clinical laboratory values (i.e., hematology, serum chemistry, coagulation, and urinalysis) 
• ECGs 
• Vital signs  

Protocol VX17-445-103, Version 3.0 Page 53 of 67 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   • Pulse oximetry  
All safety data from the TE Period will be summarized by [CONTACT_6654]. 
All safety data will be presented in individual subject data listings, including safety data from the 
Run-in Period. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events 
For analysis purposes, AEs will be classified as pretreatment AEs, TEAEs during the Run-in 
Period, TEAEs during the Treatment Period, or post- treatment AEs, defined as follows:  
• Pretreatment AE : any AE that occurred before the first dose date of study drug (TEZ/IVA) 
in the Run-in Period 
• TEAE during the Run- in Period : any AE that worsened (either in severity or seriousness) 
or that was newly developed at or after the first dose date of study drug (TEZ/IVA) through the end of the TE Period for the Run-in Period 
• TEAE during the Treatment Period : any AE that worsened (either in severity or 
seriousness) or that was newly developed at or after the first dose date of study drug (TC or 
placebo + TEZ/IVA) through the end of the TE Period for the Treatment Period 
• Post-treatment AE : any AE that worsened (either in severity or seriousness) or that was 
newly developed after:  
o the TE Period for the Run- in Period if the subject did not receive treatment in the 
Treatment Period  
o the TE Period for the Treatment Period if the subject received treatment in the Treatment Period 
For AEs with missing or partial start dates, if there is no clear evidence that the AEs started before or after study drug treatment, then the AEs will be classified as TEAEs corresponding to the Treatment Period. Unless otherwise specified, TEAE refers to TEAE during the Treatment Period. 
AE summary table s will be presented for TEAEs, by [CONTACT_1570], and will include the 
following: 
• All TEAEs  
• TEAEs by [CONTACT_155429]  
• TEAEs by [CONTACT_764]  
• TEAEs leading to treatment discontinuation  
• TEAEs leading to treatment interruption  
• Grade 3 and Grade 4 TEAEs 
• Serious TEAEs  
• TEAEs leading to death  
• Frequently reported TEAEs

13 PROCEDURAL, ETHICAL, REGULA TORY, AND ADMINISTRA TIVE 
CONSIDERATIONS  
13.1 Adverse Event and Serious Adverse Event Documentation, Severity 
Grading, and Reporting 
13.1.1 Adverse Events 
[IP_ADDRESS] Definition of an Adverse Event  
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject during the study; the event does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. This includes any newly 

Protocol VX17-445-103, Version 3.0 Page 56 of 67 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   occurring event or worsening of a pre-existing condition (e.g., increase in its severity or 
frequency) after the ICF is signed.  
An AE is considered serious if it meets the definition in Section [IP_ADDRESS].  
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinically Significant Assessments 
Study assessments including laboratory tes ts, ECGs, PEs, and vital signs will be assessed and 
those deemed to have clinically -significant worsening from baseline will be documented as an 
AE. When possible, a clinical diagnosis for the study assessment will be provided, rather than the abnormal test result alone (e.g.,  urinary tract infection, anemia). In the absence of a diagnosis, 
the abnormal study assessment itself will be listed as the AE (e.g.,  bacteria in urine or decreased 
hemoglobin). 
An abnormal study assessment is considered clinically si gnificant if the subject has 1  or more of 
the following: 
• Concomitant signs or symptoms related to the abnormal study assessment 
• Further diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention  
• A change in the dose of study drug or discontinuation from the study 
Repeat testing to determine whether the result is abnormal, in the absence of any of the above 
criteria, does not necessarily meet clinically significant criteria. The determination of whether the study assessment results are clinically significant will be made by [CONTACT_093].  
A laboratory value that is Grade [ADDRESS_179862]’s clinical status indicates a life -threatening AE.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Documentation of Adverse Events  
All AEs will be collected from the time the ICF is signed until the subject completes study participation, as defined in Section 9.1.7. 
All subjects will be queried, using nonleading questions, about the occurrence of AEs at each 
study visit. When possible, a constellation of signs and/or symptoms will be identified as 
[ADDRESS_179863]’s source documents. The following data will be documented for each AE:  
• Description of the event 
• Classification of “serious” or “nonserious” 
• Date of first occurrence and date of resolution (if applicable) 
• Severity 
• Causal relationship to study drug(s)  
• Action taken  
• Outcome  
• Concomitant medication or other treatment given  

Protocol VX17-445-103, Version 3.0 Page 57 of 67 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   [IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Event Severity  
The investigator will determine and record the severity of all serious and nonserious AEs. The 
guidance available at the following website will be consulted: Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version 4.0, Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program, http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm  (Accessed 
28 September 2017). AEs of CTCAE Grades  4 and 5 will be documented as “life-threatening.” 
In considering the severity of an AE in a pediatric subject, the investigator will consider that reference ranges for pediatric clinical laboratory parameters may differ from those given in the CTCAE. The severity of an AE that does not appear in the CTCA E will be determined according 
to the definitions in Table 13-1.  
Table 13-1 Grading of AE Severity  
Classification  Definition  
Mild (Grade  1) Mild level of discomfort and does not interfere with regular activities  
Moderate (Grade  2) Moderate level of discomfort and significantly interferes with regular activities  
Severe (Grade  3) Significant level of discomfort and prevents regular activities  
Life-threatening (Grade  4) Any adverse drug event that places the subject, in the view of the investigator, at 
immediate risk of death  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Event  Causality  
Every effort will be made by [CONTACT_63398], if any, to the 
study drug(s). Causality will be classified using the categories presented in Table 13-2. 
Table 13-[ADDRESS_179864] been ruled out, 
and/or the event reappeared on re -exposure to the investigational study drug.  
Possibly related There is an association between the event and the administration of the 
investigational study drug and there is a plausible mechanism for the event to be 
related to investigational study drug, but there may also be alternative etiology, such 
as characteristics of the subject’s clinical status or underlying disease.  
Unlikely related  The event is unlikely to be related to the investigational study drug and likely to be 
related to factors other than investigational study drug.  
Not related  The event is related to an etiology other than the investigational study drug (the 
alternative etiology will be documented in the study subject’s medical record).  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Study Drug Action Taken  
The investigator will classify the study drug action taken with regard to the AE. The action taken 
will be classified according to the categories shown in Table 13-3.  

Protocol VX17-445-103, Version 3.[ADDRESS_179865] to an AE 
Classification  Definition  
Dose not changed  Study drug dose not changed in response to an AE  
Dose reduced  Study drug dose reduced in response to an AE  
Drug interrupted  Study drug administration interrupted in response to an AE  
Drug withdrawn  Study drug administration permanently discontinued in response to an AE  
Not applicable  Action taken regarding study drug administration does not apply.  
“Not applicable” will be used in circumstances such as when the investigational 
treatment had been completed before the AE began and no opportunity to decide 
whether to continue, interrupt, or withdraw treatment is possible.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Event Outcome 
An AE will be followed until the investigator has determined and provided the final outcome. 
The outcome will be classified according to the categories shown in Table 13-4. 
Table 13-4 Classifications for Outcome of an AE 
Classification  Definition  
Recovered/resolved  Resolution of an AE with no residual signs or symptoms  
Recovered/resolved with 
sequelae Resolution of an AE with residual signs or symptoms  
Not recovered/not 
resolved (continuing)  Either incomplete improvement or no improvement of an A E, such that it remains 
ongoing 
Fatal Outcome of an AE is death. “Fatal” will be used when death is at least possibly 
related to the AE.  
Unknown  Outcome of an AE is not known (e.g.,  a subject lost to follow -up) 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Treatment Given  
The investigator ensures adequate medical care is provided to subjects for any AEs, including 
clinically significant laboratory values related to study drug. In addition, the investigator will describe whether any treatment was given for the AE. “Yes” is used if any treatment was  given 
in response to an AE, and may include treatments such as other medications, surgery, or physical therapy. “No” indicates the absence of any kind of treatment for an AE.  
13.1.2 Serious Adverse Events 
[IP_ADDRESS] Definition of a Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is any AE that meets any of the following outcomes:  
• Fatal (death, regardless of cause, that occurs during participation in the study or occurs after 
participation in the study and is suspected of being a delayed toxicity due to administration of 
the study drug) 
• Life-threatening, such that the subject was at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it 
occurred  

Protocol VX17-445-103, Version 3.0 Page 59 of 67 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   • Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_318] 
• Persistent or significant disability/incapacity (disability is defined as a substantial disruption 
of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions) 
• Congenital anomaly or birth defect 
• Important medical event that, based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the 
subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes listed above (e.g., an allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home)  
If a subject has a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_29918] (e.g., surgery) for an event or condition that occurred before the subject signed the ICF, and the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_139355], the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_155409], unless an AE caused the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_139357]. In addition, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_94253] (e.g.,  social hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8933]) will not be 
considered to indicate an SAE. 
Clarification will be made between the terms “s erious” and “severe” because they are not 
synonymous. The term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific 
event, as in mild, moderate, or severe myocardial infarction. The event itself, however, may be of relatively minor med ical significance, such as a severe headache. This is not the same as 
“serious,” which is based on subject/event outcome or action described above, and is usually associated with events that pose a threat to a subject’s life or functioning. Seriousness, not severity, serves as a guide for defining expedited regulatory reporting obligations.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Documentation of Serious Adverse Events  
All SAEs that occur after obtaining informed consent through completion of study participation, 
regardless of causality, will be reported by [CONTACT_155431]. In addition, all SAEs that occur after completion of study participation and are considered related to study drug(s) will be reported to Vertex GPS within 24  hours. 
SAEs will be recorded on the Vertex Organized Safety Information Collection Form (hereafter 
referred to as the “SAE Form”) using a recognized medical term or diagnosis that accurately reflects the event. SAEs will be assessed by [CONTACT_94316](s) an d possible etiologies. On the SAE Form, relationship to study drug(s) will be 
assessed only as related (includes possibly related) or not related (includes unlikely related), and severity assessment will not be required. For the purposes of study analysis, if the event has not resolved at the end of the study reporting period, it will be documented as ongoing. For purposes of regulatory safety monitoring, the investigator is required to follow the event to resolution and report to Vertex the outcome of the event using the SAE Form. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Reporting Serious Adverse Events 
The investigator is responsible for notifying the sponsor within 24 hours of identifying an SAE, 
regardless of the presumed relationship to the investigational study drug. The SAE Form will be completed for new/initial events as well as to report follow -up information on previously 
reported events. Investigators are asked to report follow-up information as soon as it becomes available to ensure timely reporting to health authorities.

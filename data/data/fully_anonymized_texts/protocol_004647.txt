Study Design:  
This is a phase 2, double masked, randomized, multi -center, parallel -group, 28 -day study assessing the safety, 
tolerability and ocular hypotensive efficacy of AKB -9778 Ophthalmic Solution 4.0% administered once (AM) or twice 
(AM & PM) daily when used as an  adjunctive therapy to  latanoprost ophthalmic solution 0.005% once daily (PM) in 
subjects with elevated IOP due to OAG or OHT.  Eligible subjects are required to have a diagnosis of either OAG or 
OHT in each eye and are on stable dose of topi[INVESTIGATOR_391716] (for at least 2 weeks prior to screening) . 
Subjects eligible to be enrolled in this study must meet all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria . Subjects 
who agree to participate in this study and are randomized in the study will attend a total of 6 study visits: a Screening Visit, Qualification Visit #1, Qualification Visit #2/Day  -1 (Baseline) , and visits on Days 7, 14 and 28. After 
completion of the Screening Visit, subjects will undergo a minimum 4 -week washout period from IO P lowering 
treatment prior to attending Qualification Visit #1. Subjects will receive an eye examination including IOP 
measurements at Qualification Visits #1 and #2 /Day  -1.  If deemed eligible,  subjects  will be enrolled at Qualification 
Visit #2 /Day  -1 and assigned to 1 of 3 treatment arms (AKB -9778 QD + Latanoprost; AKB -9778 BID + Latanoprost; 
or Latanoprost monotherapy) in a 1:1:[ADDRESS_491807] 
randomization will be stratified  by [CONTACT_391773] o n Day  -1 (< 26 mmHg vs ≥ 26 mmHg)  in the study eye . During 
the treatment period,  randomized  subjects will self-administer study medication (AKB- 9778 4.0%  or placebo  for AKB -
9778 ) daily in the AM and PM and will also administer 0.005% latanoprost ophthalmic  solution  daily in the PM. Daily 
AM dose administration of study medication should occur between 7:00 and 10:00 hours and PM dose administration 
should occur between 19:00 and 22:[ADDRESS_491808] 5 minutes be fore 
administration of the PM dose of study medication. Subjects will begin dosing with the AM dose of study medication 
on the morning of Day 1 and conclude dosing after administration of  the AM dose of study medication on Day 28 
(there is no PM dose on Da y 28) . At visits conducted on Days 14 and 28, subjects will self-administer  the AM dose of 
study medication at the site after the 8:[ADDRESS_491809] been completed . During the treatment 
period, subjects will be seen in the clinic on Days  7, 14 and 28; safety assessments will be conducted on all days and 
efficacy measurements (IOP) will be conducted on Days 14 and 28 at the following time points: 08:00, 10:00, 12:00 and 16:00 hours. Following completion of the Day 28 study visit procedures , subjects will exit from the study. For 
subjects who discontinue early, every possible effort will be made to assure there is an exit visit that includes all 
required examinations for the Day 28 visit.  
Number of Subjects Planned:  
Approximately 195 subjects are planned to be randomized  (approximately 65 per treatment group) .  
Number of Sites Planned:  
Approximately  25 sites across the [LOCATION_003] are planned.   
Duration of Treatment: 28 days  
Duration of Participation : 
The Screening, Washout , Qualification Visit s and Treatment periods will require subject participation for up to  
approximately 1 1 weeks.

• Population -level summary:  
- The difference in the mean diurnal change from baseline IOP at the Day 28 Visit, between study eyes 
treated with each dose of AKB -9778 (QD and BID) + Latanoprost and study eyes treated with

Sensitivity analyses will be performed on observed data only and where worst time consistent observation within a 
subject is carried forward for withdrawal due to lack of efficacy or adverse event and last time consistent observation within a subject is carried forward for other missi ng data.  
The primary analysis of the primary efficacy outcome will employ a linear model with Day 28 mean diurnal change

effect factor, usin g the intent to treat population with multiple imputation techniques used to impute missing data.  
The least squares mean differences (test – control) between AKB -9778 + Latanoprost and Latanoprost monotherapy 
will be presented as well as 2 -sided p- values and 95% confidence intervals. Inference will be made on the p -value < 
0.05.  
Sixty -five (65) subjects per arm completing 28 days of treatment yields 80% power to conclude statistical superiority 
of AKB -9778  (QD or BID)  + Latanoprost   to Latanoprost monotherapy assuming a two -sided alpha = 0.05, a true 
difference in mean diurnal change from baseline IOP  of 1.[ADDRESS_491820]’s study eye (leading to an SD of the 
mean diurnal IOP of 3.0 mmHg) .  
An interim analysis for futility is planned to be performed when 50% of randomized subjects have completed 28 days of therapy.

Page 18 of 89  4.0 BACKGROUND INFORMATION 
Open angle glaucoma  (OAG) is a leading cause of blindness affecting approximately 44.7 
million people worldwide with an estimated prevalence in the [LOCATION_002] of 2.7 million in 
2011, which is expected to increase to 7.3 million by 2050 ( Tham et al., 2014; Vajaranant et al. 
2012; Vajaranant et al., 2012b).  OAG is characterized by [CONTACT_391775]. Elevated intraocular pressure (IOP)/ Ocular hypertension 
(OHT ) is the primary modifiable risk factor and reducing IOP is the only clinical approach 
shown to slow/prevent vision loss ( Gordon et al., 2002; Heijl et al., 2002 ; Kass et al., 2002; 
Leske et al., 2007). Despi[INVESTIGATOR_391721], many patients require multiple agents to control IOP that together often fail to achieve a “target” IOP ( Aptel et 
al., 2015).   
Aerpio Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Aerpio) is developi[INVESTIGATOR_391722] -9778 Ophthalmic Solution as a 
treatment for OAG. AKB -9778 is a novel small molecule which selectively inhibits VE -PTP 
(vascular endothelial -protein tyrosine phosphatase), otherwise known as HPTPβ (human protein 
tyrosine phosphatase β), and enhances Tie2 (tyrosine kinase with immunoglobulin -like and 
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_39660] (EGF)-like domains 2) activation and signaling . Recent findings 
suggest that An giopoietin (Angpt)/Tie2 pathway activation may have therapeutic benefit in 
patients with OAG and OHT by [CONTACT_391776] (CO) pathway. The CO pathway, consisting of the trabecular meshwork (TM) and a specialized vessel called 
Schlemm’s canal, controls IOP under normal physiology and has been identified as the site of 
increased resistance to aqueous humor (AH) outflow in OAG ( Grant, 1951; Grant, 1963; Stamer 
and Acott, 2012). Importantly, a vast majority of topi[INVESTIGATOR_391723], but rather reduce IOP by [CONTACT_391777]. The failure of current thera pi[INVESTIGATOR_391724] (Braunger et al., 2015; Stamer, 2012). Relative to c urrent therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], developi[INVESTIGATOR_391725], and may prevent progression of OAG that often occurs despi[INVESTIGATOR_391726].  
4.1 Rationale 
Schlemm’s  canal develops postnatally from the intrascleral venous plexus but has a “hybrid” 
phenotype characterized by [CONTACT_391778] (Aspelund et al., 2014; Hamanaka et al., 1992; Kizhatil et al., 2014 ; Park et al., 2014; 
Truong et al., 2014).  Tie2, the receptor for the Angpt family of secreted proteins, is a receptor tyrosine kinase expressed on both blood and lymph endothelial cells and is required for development of both vascular systems ( Augustin et al., 2009 ; Morisada et al., 2005; Peters et al., 
2004; Saharinen et al., 2017; Tammela et al., 2005). Tie2 is constitutively expressed and activated in the normal adult blood vasculature, consistent with  the established role of the Tie2 
pathway in maintenance of endothelial function and vascular stability ( Wong et al., 1997). 
Recently, two independent groups have shown that Tie2 is expressed and activated in Schlemm’s canal end othelial cells during development and in the mature vessel (Bernier -Latmani and

Aerpio  — Company Confidential 
Page 19 of 89  Petrova, 2017; Kim et al., 2017; Thomson et al., 2014) .  Disruption of the Tie2 pathway in mice, 
by [CONTACT_391779]2 or both Tie2 ligands (Angpt1 and Angpt2) early in postnatal 
development (postnatal day 1), results in failure of the formation of Schlemm’s canal, associated with increased IOP with retinal and optic nerve p athology resembling human congenital 
glaucoma ( Kim et al., 2017; Thomson et al., 2014).  Tie2 pathway disruption later in postnatal 
development (8 weeks) results in degeneration of Schlemm’s canal w ith development of 
increased IOP and retinal and optic pathology reminiscent of OAG ( Kim et al., 2017 ).  Tie2 is 
most highly expressed in mature inner wall endothelium of Schlemm’s canal and disruption of the Tie2 pathway results in increased apoptosis and reduced formation of giant vacuoles consistent with compromised CO. Supporting these preclinical findings, Tie2 loss of function variants were identified in 10 of 189 unrelated primary congenital glaucoma families, and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in Angpt1, the Tie2 activating ligand, were significantly associated with the risk of OAG ( Bailey et al., 2017; Choquet et al., 2017 ; Kabra et al., 2017; 
Souma et al., 2016). The preclinical findings, along with human genetic evidence, suggest that activation of the Angpt/Tie2 pathway in Schlemm’s canal could provide a novel CO- targeted 
OAG therapy.  
VE-PTP is a receptor tyrosine phosphatase that is co -expressed with Tie2 in vascular endothelial 
cells that functions as a pi[INVESTIGATOR_391727]2 activation (Shen et al., 2014). AKB-9778 is a potent and selective small molecule inhibitor of the catalytic activity of VE -PTP.  
Pharmacologic inhibition of VE -PTP with AKB -9778 restores Tie2 activation independent of the 
presence or absence of Tie2 ligands Angpt1 and Angpt2.  Consistent with a role for VE -PTP in 
regulation of CO, subcutaneous (SC) administration of AKB-9778 reduced IOP in subjects with diabetic macular edema and nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy.  Topi[INVESTIGATOR_391728]-9778 reduced IOP more than subcutaneous AKB-9778 adm inistration in rabbits and 
decreased IOP in mice in association with  increased Tie2 activation in Schlemm’s canal 
endothelium and increased outflow facility. Data in normotensive dogs indicate that topi[INVESTIGATOR_391728] -9778 immediately following topi[INVESTIGATOR_391729] 0.005% 
latanoprost is well tolerated and has an additive IOP -lowering effect relative to latanoprost alone.  
Moreover, in a recently completed Phase 1b study, topi[INVESTIGATOR_391728]-9778 once a day for 7 days wa s well tolerated (minimal to mild conjunctival hyperemia only) and 
significantly reduced IOP in a cohort of OHT/OAG patients on standard of care prostaglandin therapy.  Taken together, these data support development of AKB-9778 Ophthalmic Solution as a novel CO targeted treatment for OAG/OHT  and provide strong rationale for the current study 
with AKB-[ADDRESS_491829]. 
4.2 Summary of Non- Clinical Experience 
Please see the AKB -9778 Ophthalmic Solution Investigator Brochure for additional discussion 
and information for the following section. The nonclinical experience for AKB -9778 Ophthalmic Solution is supported by a comprehensive 
set of in vitro and systemic pharmacology and nonclinical studies completed during the 
development of the AKB-9778 SC  Injection program, including evaluation in multiple 
retinopathy models, safety pharmacology studies, pharmacokinetic (PK) and metabolism studies, 
toxicology studies in rats, dogs, and monkeys, embryo- fetal development studies in rats and

Page [ADDRESS_491830] been 
implicated in modulation of CO facility including endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) 
activation and Rho pathway inhibition via Ras- related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (Rac1)/ 
Ras-proximate 1 (Rap1) activation (Frye et al., 2015; Shen et al., 2014).  In ocular normotensive 
mice, topi[INVESTIGATOR_391728] -9778 activated Tie2 in Schlemm’s canal 
endothelium after a single dose and reduced IOP via increased outflow facility after three days of once a day dosing. 
In norm otensive female New Zealand White rabbits (n = 5/group) administered bilateral topi[INVESTIGATOR_391730] (30 μL to both eyes) of 1.5% weight/volume (w/v) AKB -9778 in 15% w/v 
hydroxypropyl- beta-cyclodextrin ( HPβCD ) + 2% w/v dextrose or 4.0% w/v AKB-9778 in 15% 
w/v HPβCD + 1% w/v dextrose either once daily (QD) or BID, or vehicle control (15% w/v 
HPβCD) twice daily  (BID), or subcutaneous administration of 10 mg/kg AKB-[ADDRESS_491831] dose. Results showed that AKB- 9778 Ophthalmic Solution 
4.0% w/v topi[INVESTIGATOR_391731], whereas the 1.5% w/v BID topi[INVESTIGATOR_391732] 10 mg/kg SC dose were not as effective. IOP reductions persisted through the last assessment 24 hours after the end of dosing.  
Preliminary data from a dog IOP -lowering efficacy study indicates that topi[INVESTIGATOR_391733] 4.0% w/v AKB-9778 in a 15% w/v HPβCD + 1% w/v mannitol formulation 
also lo wers IOP in normotensive dogs. Further, administration of AKB-9778 immediately 
following topi[INVESTIGATOR_391729] 0.005% latanoprost was well tolerated and had an additive IOP-lowering effect relative to latanoprost alone.  
Safety Pharmacology 
All in vitro  and in vivo  safety pharmacology assessments were conducted for AKB -9778 SC 
Injection program. In vitro assessments demonstrated very limited interactions with AKB -9778; 
and in vivo safety pharmacology assessments demonstrated no respi[INVESTIGATOR_391734] a minimal decrease in blood pressure in dog and no effects on QT interval following SC dosing. 
4.2.2 Absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) 
In a 3-day PK study conducted in New Zealand White rabbits, topi[INVESTIGATOR_391735] 4.0% 
w/v AKB- 9778 in 15% w/v HPβCD + 1% w/v mannitol three times daily (TID) to both eyes 
(7.2 mg total daily dose) resulted in dose normalized AKB-9778 concentrations in aqueous humor approximately 2-fold higher than achieved with SC BID doses (33 mg total daily dose). By [CONTACT_22242], relative to topi[INVESTIGATOR_222784], systemic exposure following subcutaneous

Page 21 of 89  administration of the same AKB -9778 formulation had a ~44 -fold greater maximum plasma drug 
concentration  (C max) and 29- fold gre ater area under the concentration- time curve from time [ADDRESS_491832] quantifiable concentration  (AUC last), based on dose normalized values. In dogs, following 
bilateral topi[INVESTIGATOR_391735] 30μL of 4.0% w/v AKB -9778 in 15% w/v HPβCD + 1% 
w/v mannitol QD (2.4 mg/day), BID (4.8 mg/day), or four times daily (QID, 9.6 mg/day) for 3 
days, plasma half-life (T½) was 0.5 hours and mean plasma C max and AUC values were generally 
similar across groups, suggesting rapid elimination of AKB-9778 between the BID and QID inter-day dosing intervals. There was no evidence for accumulation between the QD, BID, and QID dosing regimens.  
In the Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) 28-day rabbit and dog toxicity studies, quantifiable 
systemic exposure of AKB -9778 in plasma was observed following bilateral topi[INVESTIGATOR_391733] 30 μL of 4% w/v AKB -9778 in 15% w/v HPβCD + 1% w/v mannitol to each 
eye QD (2.4 mg/day), BID (4.8 mg/day), and QID (9.6 mg/day) in males and females on Day [ADDRESS_491833] week of dosing (Day 23 for rabbit; Day 26 for dog).  There were no consistent sex-related differences in systemic exposure; however, the data exhibited a high degree of inter-
animal variability. In most cases, an initial peak at ≤ 0.25 hours postdose was observed in the mean concentration-time profiles across all dosing regimens and days; however, a second peak in some cases constituted C
max. Systemic exposure to AKB -9778 was similar (C max and AUC 
approximately within 2-fold) following BID and QID dosing regimens on Day 1 and Days 23 and 26 for rabbits and dogs, respectively. Exposure was generally similar across all three dosing regimens with no evidence of accumulation. 
4.2.3 Toxicology 
Topi[INVESTIGATOR_391736] (AKB -9778 Ophthalmic Solution) 
The topi[INVESTIGATOR_391735] 4.0% w/v AKB -9778 in 10% w/v to 15% w/v HPβCD -based 
solution formulations has been well tolerated in rabbits and dogs in non-GLP toleration and GLP 
toxicity studies.  
In the 28- day GLP toxicity studies, New Zealand White rabbits and Beagle dogs were 
administered a 30 μL bilateral ocular instillation of 4.0% w/v AKB -9778 in 15% w/v HPβCD + 
1% w/v mannitol (1.2 mg/eye) QD (2.4 mg/day), BID (4.8 mg/day), and QID (9.6 mg/day) for [ADDRESS_491834] 
article -related clinical observations involved only the eyes and surrounding skin areas for both 
rabbit and dog. 
In rabbit, AKB-9778- related effects were primarily limited to clinical observations that included 
red conjunctiva (palpebral conjunctiva), red skin of the periorbital region, and red eyeballs 
(bulbar conjunctiva) .  Palpebral conjunctiva and periorbital skin redness were observed in all 
drug- treated animals the last [ADDRESS_491835] week of dosing but at a lesser incidence. Red eyeballs (red bulbar conjunctiva) were observed only in the test article -treated rabbits at the end of the dosing 
period on Days 28 and 29. In dog, similar results were noted where AKB-9778- related effects

Page 22 of 89  were also limited to clinical observations includin g clear discharge, red eyeballs (bulbar 
conjunctiva), and red conjunctiva (palpebral conjunctiva). Red eyeballs were observed in all but 
one drug- treated animal, in 2/10 vehicle control, and in 2/[ADDRESS_491836] onset in dogs treated at 9.6 mg/day. These non-adverse findings in dog and rabbit resolved quickly during the recovery phase. Dose- dependent 
clear ocular discharge was observed in dog at all dose levels, including the vehicle control, but with the greatest incidence following QID dosing, with persistence in the QID group throughout the recovery phase.  
There were no microscopic histopathological findings in the 28-day dog toxicity study. In rabbit, 
marked diffuse unilateral corneal epi[INVESTIGATOR_391737] [ADDRESS_491837] could not be ruled out due to its occurrence in the high -dose group; therefore, this 
finding was considered to have an uncertain relationship to the administration of the test article. 
The no observed adverse- effect level  (NOAEL ) in the 28-day rabbit and dog toxicity studies was 
considered to be the highest dose administered in each study at 9.6 mg/day (2.4 mg QID). In 
rabbits, this dose was associated with mean combined -sex C
max and estimated AUC 0-24 values of 
20.7 ng/mL and 132 ng·hr/mL, respectively; and, in dogs, of 51.7 ng/mL and 243 ng·hr/mL, respectively.  These exposures numerically describe the margin to human exposure since the 
measured human exposure following topi[INVESTIGATOR_391738] 40 mg/mL AKB -9778 QD 
and BID was below the limit of quantitation (BLQ = <1 ng/mL). 
Systemic (AKB -9778 Injection) 
In the in vivo GLP general, genetic, and reproductive toxicity studies for AKB-9778 Injection, AKB- 9778 was formulated as a solution in  10% w/v HPβCD + 1.7% w/v dextrose and 
demonstrated an excellent safety profile and was well tolerated by [CONTACT_391780] 6 months (182 days) dosing in rats and up to 9 months (273 days) dosing in dogs and monkeys. The primary target tissues for AKB-9778 were identified as injection site and liver in rat, dog and monkey; skin/subcutis (vascular) in dog and monkey; and gastrointestinal (GI; vascular) in dog. The NOAEL  exposures measured in rat, dog, and monkey were, respectively, 4-, 25-, and 
33-fold the AUC value associated with a human dose of [ADDRESS_491838] been observed in clinical 
studies with SC administration of AKB -9778. 
AKB-9778 is not considered to be mutagenic or clastogenic based on the negative findings in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_391739].

4.[ADDRESS_491839] clinical program has been conducted with a subcutaneous formulation of AKB-9778 
(AKB-9778 SC injection) and a phase 1 study evaluating topi[INVESTIGATOR_391728]-9778 Ophthalmic Solution in healthy volunteers and subjects with OAG/OHT has recently been completed.  Clinical experience is summarized below . IOP reduction effects observed in studies 
conducted with AKB -[ADDRESS_491840]  and support  evaluation of Tie2 activation  by 
[CONTACT_391781]- 9778 as a potential  approach for IOP reduction in subjects with  OAG or OHT.  
4.3.1 AKB- 9778 SC Injection  
AKB-9778 SC injection 20 mg/mL has been evaluated under an ongoi ng clinical development 
program in the [LOCATION_002] for diabetic eye disease, including diabetic retinopathy and diabetic macular edema. A total of [ADDRESS_491841] been randomized in completed clinical trials evaluating AKB -9778 SC administration (in the abdomen) . Data from the two largest clinical 
trials conducted with this formulation are summarized as follows.  
Study AKB -9778- CI-2003, was a Phase 2, double -masked,  parallel -group trial in which  144 
subjects with  diabetic retinopathy  complicated  by [CONTACT_384] -involved diabetic macular edema were  
randomized to one  of 3 treatment  groups:  AKB- 9778 (15 mg) SC BID monotherapy;  AKB- 9778 
SC BID plus monthly Lucentis
® (0.3 mg) intravitreal injection  (IVT); and monthly Lucentis®  
IVT monotherapy. Op hthalmic  assessment  at baseline, during and at  the end  of the 3- month 
treatment period, included IOP measurement  by [CONTACT_391782].  Pretreatment  baseline IOP assessment  showed both the study eye and fellow  eyes 
of each treatment  group to be normotensive and well balanced  between  treatment groups. Both  
active AKB- 9778 treatment arms achieved  statistically  significant  reductions  in IOP in both the 
study eye  and the fellow eye  compared to baseline . In the subgroup of subjects with  baseline IOP 
> 16 mm Hg,  a greater  IOP reduction  was achieved.  
Study AKB -9778- CI-50 01, was a Phase 2, double -masked, placebo -controlled, parallel -group 
trial in which 167 subjects with moderate to severe non- proliferative diabetic retinopathy were 
randomized to receive once or twice daily AKB -9778 SC (15 mg) for [ADDRESS_491842] of Tie-2 activation. Vasovagal events (presyncope/syncope) have been 
observed following the first dose of AKB-9778 at doses >[ADDRESS_491843] dose in 1/144 (0.7%) subjects in the Phase 2 AKB-9778- CI-2003 study.

Page [ADDRESS_491844] did not experience any such events during the subsequent 3 months of dosing. No 
other vasovagal events were observed in this study. In both studies there was a significant correlation between baseline blood pressure ( BP) and change in BP. Specifically, subjects with 
higher BP had greater reductions in BP. To date there has been no evidence of adverse effects on clinical chemistry assessments, including liver function tests, and no evidence of unusual dermal findings. 
4.3.2 AKB- 9778 Ophthalmic  Solution  
A Phase 1b study evaluating AKB-9778 ophthalmic solution has been recently completed. Study 
AKB-9778- CI-OS-1001 was a randomized, double-masked study designed to assess increasing 
concentrations of AKB-9778 dosed topi[INVESTIGATOR_391740] (5mg/mL QD, 15 mg/mL QD, 40 mg/mL QD and 40 mg/mL BID) conducted initially in 4 sequential cohorts of 12 healthy (ocular normotensive subjects), randomized 3:[ADDRESS_491845] QD dose cohort (40mg/mL) peaked at [ADDRESS_491846]-dose (- 1.47 mmHg; p = 0.041)/-10.64%; p = 0.027) and was sustained through eight hours on day 7, returning to baseline levels at [ADDRESS_491847] dose (40 mg/mL) indicated almost no systemic exposure (all samp les 
(except 1 sample) were reported as below limit of quantitation  (BLQ) using a bioanalytical 
method with a lower limit of quantification of 1 ng/mL).  As a result, no systemic AEs are anticipated for the topi[INVESTIGATOR_391741]-9778. 
No signific ant safety issues were identified in Cohorts 1 -4.  Overall, there was 1 AE in the 
5 mg/mL (upper airway cough syndrome ), 15 mg/ mL (scratch), and placebo (blood pressure 
increased ) treatment groups and 7 AEs in 3 subjects in the 40 mg/mL QD treatment group (2 
events of dysgeusia in 2 subjects; 2 events of conjunctival hyperemia in 2 subjects; [ADDRESS_491848] ). All AEs were 
mild and all resolved by [CONTACT_2054]. There were no significant changes in vital signs, body system assessment, clinical labs or visual acuity. In the formal assessments of hyperemia score, minimal  to mild conjunctival hyperemia was observed in subjects receiving A KB-9778. 
The hyperemia was transient and uniformly resolved to minimal or none by 4-[ADDRESS_491849]-dose. 
Based on favorable tolerability and pharmacodynamic findings in these ocular normotensive 
subjects, a fifth cohort of subjects with OHT/POAG on standard of care prostaglandin therapy was added to assess the safety, tolerability and pi[INVESTIGATOR_391742]- daily AKB-9778 
(40 mg/mL) as an adjunctive therapy. Briefly, 43 subjects were recruited with OHT/POAG and baseline IOP measurements ≥ 17 and ≤ 27 mmHg while  treated with once-daily prostaglandin 
therapy. Subjects were randomized 3:1 to receive either AKB -9778 (32 subjects) or placebo (11

therapy. Conjunctival hyper emia and IOP were assessed in the same manner as described for 
Cohorts 1-4 (see above).  Subjects in Cohort [ADDRESS_491850] -AKB-9778 administration time

with prostaglandin alone (see Figure 1; Diurnal = mean IOP of 2, 4 an d 8 hour time points; ** p 
< 0.05, *** p < 0.001).  On Day 7, the diurnal mean reduction was -1.58 mmHg (p < 0.001) compared to 0.06 mmHg for placebo (p = 0.462).

Topi[INVESTIGATOR_391728] -9778 was well tolerated over seven days of dosing in 
Cohort 5. In the active treatment group  treated with AKB -9778 plus prostaglandin, 21.9% of 
subjects experienced hyperemia compared with 9.1% of subjects in the prostaglandin  
monotherapy treatment group . In all cases, this hyperemia was minimal -to-mild in severity, 
transient in duration and generally considered non- adverse. There were no other ocular AEs and 
no systemic AEs reported during the seven days of dosing in Cohort 5. 
4.4 Risks and Benefits to Human Subjects  
4.4.1 Potential Benefits and Risks of AKB -9778 
Please see the AKB -9778 Investigator Brochure for additional discussion and information for 
the following section.  
Potential benefits: In this study, subjects are unlikely to benefit from the short- term 
administration of the AKB -9778 Ophthalmic Solution.  However, the results of this study may 
lead to continued development of AKB-9778 Ophthalmic Solution as a novel CO -targeted 
treatment for OAG/OHT.  
Potential risks:  No serious risks have been identified in nonclinical toxicology studies of 
AKB-9778 Ophthalmic Solution of up to 28 days duration or in extensive nonclinical toxicology and clinical studies of AKB- 9778 Subcutaneous Injection.  Mean IOP

Page 26 of 89  Potential risks based on the nonclinical topi[INVESTIGATOR_391743]- 9778 include conjunctival 
hyperemia and local ocular irritation. Potential risks identified in AKB -9778 Subcutaneous 
Injection nonclinical studies  include hemodynamic findings (blood pressure reduction), liver 
findings and dermal vascular findings. To date, similar findings relating to the liver and dermal 
vasculature have not been observed in clinical trials.  
Based upon the observed clinical safet y data from the subcutaneous program, the following risks 
have been identified: hemodynamic effects (transient reductions in blood pressure and 
compensatory increases in heart rate), adverse events related to local tolerability, and allergic reaction.  
The identified non- ocular risks are mitigated by [CONTACT_391783] -[ADDRESS_491851] dose tested (40 mg/mL ). There were no clinically significant changes in  vital signs including blood pressure 
and heart rate consistent with much lower systemic exposure of AKB-[ADDRESS_491852] medical practice based on the Investigator’s judgment. Dose delays may be implemented as necessary. Subjects will be withdr awn from the study if persistent or 
unacceptable treatment -related toxicity is observed .

6.0 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
6.1 Overall Study Design and Plan 
This is a phase 2, double masked, randomized, multi- center, parallel -group, 28-day study to 
evaluate the safety, tolerability and ocular hypotensive efficacy of AKB-9778 Ophthalmic 
Solution 4.0% administered once (AM) or twice (AM & PM) daily when used as an adjunctive therapy to latanoprost ophthalmic solution 0.005% once daily (PM) in subjects with elevated IOP 
due to OAG or OHT.  
Subjects will participate in the study for up to approximately 11 weeks (Screening Visit, 
Washout period for 4-6 weeks, 2 Qualification Visits (2 -7 days apart) and Treatment period for 
28 days).   
The study will be conducted at approximately 25 sites in the [LOCATION_003] . 
Approximately 195 subjects will be randomized in this study and will be assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio 
to one of the following treatment groups : 
AKB- 9778 Q D + Latanoprost 
• AKB-9778 ophthalmic solution 4.0% QD (AM) and placebo for AKB-9778 
ophthalmic solution QD (PM) plus latanoprost ophthalmic solution 0.005% QD 
(PM) for 28 days  
AKB-9778 BID + Latanoprost  
• AKB-9778 ophthalmic solution 4.0%  BID (AM & PM) plus latanoprost 
ophthalmic solution 0.005% QD (PM) for [ADDRESS_491856] Monotherapy 
• Placebo for AKB- 9778 ophthalmic solution BID (AM & PM) plus latanoprost 
ophthalmic solution 0.005% QD (PM)  for 28 days 
During the treatment period, s ubjects will self -administer study medication  (AKB-9778 
ophthalmic solution 4.0% or Placebo  for AKB-9778) daily in the AM and PM and will also 
administer latanoprost daily in the PM.  Subjects will dose in to each eye by [CONTACT_391774][INVESTIGATOR_391744]. Daily AM dose administration of study 
medication should occur between 7:00 and 10:00 hours and PM dose administration should 
occur between 19:00 and 22:[ADDRESS_491857] 5 
minutes before administration of the PM  dose of study medication. Subjects will begin dosing

Subjects who agree to participate in this study and are randomized in the study will attend a total of 6 study visits: a Screening Visit, Qualification Visit #1, Qualification Visit #2/Day  -1 
(Baseline), and visits on  Days 7, [ADDRESS_491859] be on a stable dose of topi[INVESTIGATOR_391745] (eg, bimatoprost [ Lumigan® ], latanoprost [ Xalatan® ], tafluprost 
[Zioptan®] and travoprost [ Travatan Z® ]) for at least 2 weeks prior to screening. After 
completion of the Screening Visit, subjects will undergo a minimum 4 -week washout period 
from IOP lowering treatment prior to attending Qualification Visit #1 . Among multiple 
procedures, subjects will receive an eye examination including IOP measurements at Qualification Visits #1 and #2/Day  -1 and, if deemed eligible, will be enrolled at Qualification 
Visit #2 /Day  -[ADDRESS_491860] using IWRS methodology and will stratify subjects by [CONTACT_391773]  (IOP averaged over 08:00, 10:00, 12:00, and 16:00 hour time points ) on 
Qualification Vist#2/Day  -1 (< 2 6 mmHg vs ≥ 26 mmHg) in the study eye. 
 
During the treatment period, subjects will be seen in the clinic on Days 7, 14 and 28; ocular safety assessments will be conducted on all days and efficacy measurements (IOP) will be conducted on Days 14 and 28 at the following time points: 08:00, 10:00, 12:00 and 16:[ADDRESS_491861].  
At each study visit  during the treatment period, multiple ocular safety assessments will be 
conducted including some or all of the following: adverse events, visual acuity, hyperemia 
assessment, objective findings of biomicroscopic examinations (i.e., lids, conjunctiva, cornea, 
anterior chamber, iris and lens ), cup-disc ratio measurements, and dilated ophthalmoscopic 
examination.  
An interim analysis for futility is planned to be performed when 50% of randomized subjects 
have completed [ADDRESS_491862] in design of subsequent clinical studies.

Page 30 of 89  6.3 Rationale for AKB- 9778 Dose Selection and Frequency  
The AKB-9778 dose selected for this study is based on the recently completed Phase 1b study, 
AKB-9778- CI-OS-1001. The treatment period and dosing frequency is selected on the basis of 
nonclinical safety studies with AKB-9778 and regulatory requirements for demonstration of ocular hypotensive efficacy. 
In pre-clinical studies, a dose of 30 µL of a 40 mg/mL AKB-9778 f ormulation in 15% HPβCD in 
both eyes for 7 days demonstrated a consistent diurnal reduction in IOP in a normotensive rabbit 
model without exhibiting any systemic or significant local ophthalmic tolerability issues.  In addition, no systemic or serious loca l ocular findings were observed in 28- day GLP repeat -dose 
toxicity studies in rabbit and dog following bilateral topi[INVESTIGATOR_391746] 30 μL of 40 mg/mL AKB -9778 in 15% HPβCD + 1% mannitol solution QD, BID, or QID for 28 
consecutive days. Prelim inary data in dog following a 35 μL topi[INVESTIGATOR_391747] a 40 mg/mL 
AKB- 9778 formulation in 15% HPβCD in both eyes of normotensive dogs for [ADDRESS_491863] alone and no other observed ocular changes. The 40 mg/mL AKB-[ADDRESS_491864] daily dosing regimen (BID) to be used in clinical study. The dosing regimen in the clinical trial will be QD or BID at 4.0% w/v AKB–9778. The maximum total daily dose used in the repeat-dose toxicity study in rabbits and dogs (9.6 mg/day) is  2-fold the proposed highest dose in the clinical trial. 
The measured exposures in rabbit and dog at a total daily dose of 9.6 mg/day are estimated to be, respectively, at least 20 - and 50-fold the measured human exposure (<1 ng/mL) following topi[INVESTIGATOR_391748] r administration of 4.8 mg/day (40 mg/mL AKB -9778 BID) in the Phase 1 study. The dose 
levels for the proposed study are selected to allow evaluation of tolerability and efficacy of AKB-9778 Ophthalmic Solution and are not expected to result in systemic adverse effects.   
In the Phase 1b clinical trial, AKB -9778 Ophthalmic Solution (40 mg/mL) both QD and BID 
dosing were well tolerated in ocular normotensive volunteers with a dose dependent increase in IOP reduction.  In OHT/OAG patients on standard of care prostaglandin therapy, QD dosing was well tolerated and resulted in significant IOP reduction.  Thus, based on the available preclinical and clinical data, both QD and BID dosing of AKB-9778 Ophthalmic Solution (40 mg/mL  
[4.0%]) will be studied.

Adequate contraception is defined as follows:  
Male subjects must agree to use a reliable method of birth control and to not donate sperm during the study and for [ADDRESS_491903] dose of study medication.   
• Examples of reliable methods of birth control are condoms with spermicide; effective , 
highly effective, or surgical contraceptive method by [CONTACT_9283]; and male sterilization such as bilateral orchiectomy or vasectomy.  
Male subjects exclusively with women of non-childbearing potential partners are not required to use contraception. 
Female subjects of child -bearing potential must agree to use 1 highly effective method (less than 
1% failure rate) of contraception, or a combination of [ADDRESS_491904] dose of study medication. 
• Highly effective methods of contraception: Combination oral contraceptives, implanted/injectable contraceptives, intrauterine device, bilateral tubal ligation, or permanent tubal occlusion. 
• Effective methods of contraception: Ma le or female condoms with spermicide, 
diaphragms with spermicide, or cervical sponges.  The subject may choose to use a double-barrier method of contraception.  Barrier protection methods without concomitant use of a spermicide are not a reliable or accept able method.  Thus, each barrier method 
must include use of a spermicide.  It should be noted that the use of male and female condoms as a double- barrier method is not considered acceptable due to the high failure 
rate when these methods are combined.   
Female subjects not of child -bearing potential may participate and include those who are:

Note: An increase of [ADDRESS_491908] complains of hyperemia, an AE will be recorded regardless of grade on the hyperemia scale.  
 
 
 
 
• Intraocular Pressure (IOP): IOP will be assessed by [CONTACT_391791] . IOP  assessments are conducted as follows: measure twice, with 3rd measure 
if discordant  (i.e. previous two readings >2mmHg different). The IOP used at each time 
point is the mean of 2 measurements or the median of 3 meas urements. IOP will be 
measured at Screening, Qualification Vis it #1 and #2 and frequently throughout the 
study. Note: For purposes of determining eligibility , any non- integer (non -whole 
number) mean IOP should not be rounded (e.g. if the mean of 2 IOP reading s is 23.5 
do not round up to 24) . 
• Pachymetry : Pachymetry  (contact [CONTACT_26553]- contact [INVESTIGATOR_12183])  will be performed at Screening  
and Day 28 and will be used to measure the thickness of the central cornea.  
• Gonioscopy:  Gonioscopy will conducted at S creening to confirm the iridocorneal angle is 
open and to what extent. Eligible subjects must have an angle of 3 or 4 (Shaffer grading scale; 
Kolker 1976)  for participation in the study.  
• Dilated Ophthalmoscopy : A dilated funduscopic examination including evaluation of the 
retina, vitreous, macula, choroid, optic nerve, and cup/disc ratio will be performed at Screening and Day 28. Evaluation of cup-disc ratio will be performed when ophthalmoscopy is performed.

11.0 ADVERSE EVENTS  
11.1 Definitions  
11.1.1 Adverse Events (AEs)  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or trial subject administered a drug or 
biologic (medicinal product) or using a medical device; the event does not necessarily have a causal relationship with that treatment or usage.  
AEs include the following: 
• All suspected adverse medication reactions.  
• All reactions from medication overdose, abuse, withdrawal, sensitivity, o r toxicity.  
• Apparently unrelated illnesses, including the worsening of a preexisting illness (see paragraph below on Preexisting Conditions). 
• Injury or accidents.  Note that if a medical condition is known to have caused the injury or accident ( e.g., a fa ll secondary to dizziness), the medical condition (dizziness) and the 
accident (fall) should be reported as two separate adverse events.  The outcome of the accident ( e.g., hip fracture secondary to the fall) should be recorded under Comments.

Amendment # 2 Integrated   May 17 , 2020 
  
 
Aerpio  — Company Confidential 
Page 59 of 89  • Abnormalities in physiological testing or physical examination findings that require 
clinical intervention or further investigation (beyond ordering a repeat [confirmatory] test).  
• An increase of [ADDRESS_491931] complains of hyperemia, an AE will be recorded regardless of grade on the hyperemia scale ( Section 9.2.2).  
Procedures – Diagnostic and therapeutic non-invasive and invasive procedures, such as surgery, should not be reported as adverse events.  However, the medical condition for which the procedure was performed should be reported if it meets the definition of an AE.  For example, an acute appendicitis that begins during the adverse event reporting period should be reported as the adverse event and the resulting appendectomy noted under Comments . 
Preexisting Conditions  – In this trial, a preexisting condition ( i.e., a disorder present before the 
adverse event reporting period started and noted on the pretreatment medical history/physical examination form) should not be reported as an adverse event unless the condition worsens, or epi[INVESTIGATOR_198408]. 
11.1.2 Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)  
Each adverse event is to be classified by [CONTACT_28135].  An 
adverse event that meets one or more of the following criteria/outcomes is classified as serious:  
• Death  
• Life-threatening (see paragraph below on Life -threatening) 
• In-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] (see paragraph below 
on Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) 
• Persisten t or significant disability/incapacity (see paragraph below on Disability)  
• Congenital anomaly/birth defect  
Important adverse events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_391756] ( SAE s) when, based upon appropriate 
medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. 
The term serious also includes any other event that the Investigator o r Sponsor judges to be 
serious or which is defined as serious by [CONTACT_391794].  If there is any doubt whether the information constitutes an AE or SAE, the 
information is to be treated as an SAE.

Amendment # 2 Integrated   May 17 , 2020 
  
 
Aerpio  — Company Confidential 
Page 60 of 89  Life-threatening  – Any AE that places the subject at immediate risk of death from the event as 
it occurred.  A life -threatening event does not include an event that might have caused death had 
it occurred in a more severe form but that did not create an immediate risk of death as it actually 
occurred.  For example, drug- induced hepatitis that resolved without evidence of hepatic failure 
would not be considered life threatening, even though drug- induced hepatitis of a more severe 
nature can be fatal.  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  – Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_225938] a 
minimum of 24 hours.  A hospi[INVESTIGATOR_112044] a preexisting condition that has not worsened does not constitute an SAE ( e.g., elective hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a 
total knee replacement due to a preexisting condition of osteoarthritis of the knee that has not worsened during the course of the study). 
Disability  – Defined as a substantial disruption in a person’s ability to conduct normal life 
functions.  
11.1.3 Severity  
If required on the adverse event CRF, the Investigator will use the adjectives MILD, 
MODERATE, or SEVERE to describe the maximum intensity of the adverse event.  For purposes of consistency, these intensity grades are defined as follows:  
MILD:  Does not interfere with subject's usual function  
MODERATE:  Interferes to some extent with subject's usual function  
SEVERE:  Interferes significantly with subject's usual function  
Note the distinction between the gravity and the intensity of an adverse event.  Severe is a 
measure of intensity; thus, a severe reaction is not necessarily a serious reaction.  For example, a 
headache may be severe in intensity, but would not be classifi ed as serious unless it met one of 
the criteria for serious events listed above.  
11.[ADDRESS_491932] will be questioned about AEs at each visit following the initiation of treatment.  
11.3 Reporting  
Each AE is to be classified by [CONTACT_28135].  This classification of the gravity of the event determines the reporting procedures to be followed.  If an SAE occurs, expedited reporting will follow local and international regulations, as appropriate.

criteria for serious should also be reported as an SAE. 
11.3.2 Reporting AEs  
NONSERIOUS AEs are to be reported on the adverse event case repor t forms.  
11.3.3 Reporting SAEs  
Serious adverse events should be reported on both the clinical trial adverse event CRF and the Serious Adverse Event Report Form.  
Note:  Where the same data are collected, the forms must be completed in a consistent manner.  For example, the same AE term should be used on both forms. 
Any SAE, regardless of causal relationship, must be reported to the clinical safety contact [CONTACT_391795] 24 hours after the Investigator becomes aware of the SAE by [CONTACT_391796].  Compliance with this time requirement is essential so that the Sponsor may comply with its regulatory obligations. 
The initial SAE report should be completed as fully as possible but should contain, at a 
minimum:  
• A short description of the event and the reason why the event is categorized as serious 
• Subject identification number  
• Investigator’s name  
• Name [CONTACT_225983] (not applicable for double- masked studies)  
• Causality assessment  
• Onset date  
Follow- Up information relating to an SAE must be reported to the clinical safety contact [CONTACT_391797] 24 hours of receipt by [CONTACT_391798] a completed SAE report form

or to the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor immediately.  
All deaths are to be thoroughly investigated and reported as SAEs .  Autopsy reports are to be 
obtained, if possible.  
The Sponsor and/or its designee are responsible for reporting SAEs to all applicable regulatory 
agencies and the central ethics comm ittees within the required timeline.  
The Investigator is responsible for submitting required safety information to their local IRB. This information includes but is not limited to any safety alert letter received from the Sponsor and any SAEs occurring at their site.

The causal relationship of the AE to study medication  will be assessed by [CONTACT_56694].  The following definitions will be used in assessment. 
Probably Related :  The AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of drug 
administration.  It follows a known response pattern to the study medication .  The AE cannot be 
reasonably explained by [CONTACT_1605]’s clinical state, therapeutic interventions, or concomitant drugs. 
Possibly Related:  The AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of drug 
administration but could have been produced by [CONTACT_1605]’s clinical state, other therapeutic interventions, or concomitant drugs. 
Unrela ted:  The AE does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the 
product or the AE is clearly related to other factors such as the subject’s clinical state, other therapeutic interventions, or concomitant drugs administered to the sub ject. 
11.3.[ADDRESS_491935]’s participation in the trial ends (i.e., until a final report is completed for that subject).  
In addition, all serious adverse events and those nonserious events assessed by [CONTACT_391799]'s participation in the trial is over.  Such events s hould be followed until they resolve 
or until the Investigator assesses them as “chronic” or “stable.”  Resolution of such events is to be documented on the appropriate CRF.

adverse event ( i.e., spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly 
[including that in an aborted fetus]), the Investigator should follow the procedures for reporting a serious adverse event.  
Additional information about pregnancy outcomes that are cl assified as serious adverse events 
follows:  
• Note that “spontaneous abortion” includes miscarriage and missed abortion. 
• All neonatal deaths that occur within one month of birth should be reported, without regard to causality, as serious adverse events.  In addition, any infant death after one month that the Investigator assesses as possibly or probably related to the in utero exposure to the study medication should also be reported. 
• In the case of a live birth, the “normality” of the newborn can be assessed at time of birth.  
• The “normality” of an aborted fetus can be assessed by [CONTACT_252623] -abortion laboratory findings suggestive of a congenital anomaly. 
12.0 STATISTICAL METHODS  
12.1 Primary Hypotheses  
• H
01: The difference between study eyes treated with AKB -9778 BID + Latanoprost and 
study eyes treated with Latanoprost monotherapy in Day 28 mean diurnal IOP (IOP 
averaged over the 08:00, 10:00, 12:00, and 16:00 hour time points) is ≥ 0 mmHg. 
• H11: The difference between study eyes treated with AKB-9778 BID + Latanoprost and 
study eyes treated with Latanoprost monotherapy in Day 28 mean  diurnal IOP  is < 0 
mmHg

Page 64 of 89  • H02: The difference between study eyes treated with AKB -9778 QD + Latanoprost and 
study eyes treated with Latanoprost monotherapy in Day 28 mean diurnal IOP is ≥ 0 
mmHg.  
• H12: The difference between study eyes treated with AKB -9778 QD + Latanoprost and 
study eyes treated with Latanoprost monotherapy in Day 28 mean  diurnal IOP is < 0 
mmHg.  
The study will be considered a success if either H01 or H 02 is rejected.  
12.2 Multiplicity Adjustment 
No multiplicity adjustment for the two sets of primary hypotheses will be made in this Phase 2 protocol, yielding an overall two-sided Type I Error of 0.10. 
12.3 Sample Size  Considerations  
Efficacy:  
Sixty -five (65) subjects per arm completing 28 days of treatment yields 80% power to conclude 
statistical superiority of AKB -9778 (QD or BID)  + Latanoprost to Latanoprost monotherapy 
assuming a two -sided alpha = 0.05, a true difference in mean diurnal change from baseline IOP 
of 1.[ADDRESS_491937]’s study eye (leading to an SD of the mean diurnal IOP of 3.0 mmHg)  
12.4 Analysis Populations  
Randomized Population: The randomized population will include all subjects who were 
randomized to treatment. Baseline variables and demographic characteristics will be summarized 
for this population. 
Intent- to-Treat Population (ITT): The ITT population wil l include all randomized subjects who 
have received at least one dose of study medication. This population will be the primary population for efficacy analyses and will be used to summarize all efficacy variables and will summarize subjects as randomized.  
Per-protocol population (PP): The PP population is a subset of the ITT population, which will 
include those subjects (and their visits) who do not have major protocol violations likely to seriously affect the primary outcome of the study as judged by a mas ked evaluation prior to the 
unmasking of the study treatment.  This population will be the secondary population for efficacy analyses and will be used to summarize a subset of efficacy variables.  If the PP
 and ITT 
populations are exactly the same, then additional efficacy analyses on the PP population will not be performed.  The PP population will summarize subjects as treated.

12.5 Statistical Methods to be  Employed 
12.5.1 General Considerations  
All continuous study assessments will be summarized by [CONTACT_12268] (as applicable) 
using descriptive statistics (n, mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum). All 
categorical study assessments will be summarized by [CONTACT_12268] (as applicable) using frequency counts and percentages. 
Hypothesis testing, unless otherwise indicated, will be performed at a 2 -sided 0.05 significance 
level.  When applicable, two- sided 95% confidence intervals will be reported. All p -values will 
be displayed to four decimal places, with p-values less than 0.0001 presented as '< 0.0001' and p-
values greater than 0.9999 presented as ‘> 0.9999’. Differences between AKB -9778 + 
Latanoprost and Latanoprost monotherapy will be calculated as AKB -9778 + Latanoprost minus 
Latanoprost monotherapy. 
All study data will be listed by [CONTACT_3148], subje ct and time point (as applicable).  
For diurnally- adjusted IOP, baseline will refer to the time -relevant measure at Visit 3.0 through 
3.3 (e.g., IOP at 08:00 hours at Visit 3.0 will be the baseline for 08:00 hours at Visits 5.0 and 6.0, 
IOP at 10:00 hours at Visit 3.1 will be the baseline for 10:00 hours at Visits 5.1 and 6.1, etc.). 
For all other variables, baseline is defined as the last measurement prior to the first dose of study medication.  
The unit of analysis for efficacy will be the study eye. The study eye will be the eye with the higher mean diurnal IOP on Visit 3. If both eyes have the same mean diurnal IOP on  Visit 3, 
then the right eye will be the study eye. 
Statistical methods will be more fully described in a separate document ( i.e., the Statistical 
Analysis Plan).  
12.5.2 Interim  Analyses  
An interim analysis for futility is planned to be performed when 50% of randomized subjects 
have completed [ADDRESS_491938] monotherapy in each AKB -9778 treatment group is < 30%.  
Conditional probability of achieving a 1.[ADDRESS_491939] of AKB-9778 + Latanoprost over Latanoprost monotherapy of -1.5 mmHg with a SD of 3.0 mmHg.

12.5.5 Analysis of  Efficacy  
All efficacy analyses will be conducted in  the study eye and both eyes (average of study eye and 
eligible fellow eye)  
The primary efficacy outcome will be comparison of AKB -9778 + Latanoprost (QD or BID) 
relative to La tanoprost monotherapy for:  
• Mean change from baseline in diurnal IOP on Day 28 
Secondary efficacy outcomes will include comparison of AKB-9778 + Latanoprost (QD or BID) relative to Latanoprost monotherapy for:  
• Mean change from baseline in diurnal IOP on Day 14 (study eye)  
• Mean change from baseline in diurnal IOP on Days 14 and 28 (both eyes) 
• Mean diurnal IOP on Days 14 and 28 (both eyes) 
• Mean observed IOP at each time point on Days 14 and 28 
• Mean change from diurnally adjusted baseline IOP  at each time point  on Days 14 and 28 
• Mean percent change from diurnally adjusted baseline IOP at each time point on Days 14 
and 28 
• Mean percent change from baseline in diurnal IOP on Days 14 and 28 
• Percentages of subjects achieving pre- specified mean, mean change, and percent mean 
change in diurnal IOP levels 
Additional secondary efficacy analyses may be conducted as described in the study Statistical Analysis Plan.  Note that each subject will have one eye designated as the study eye.  Only the 
study eyes will be evaluated for the primary efficacy measure or for selected secondary efficacy measures; however, both eyes will be treated. Fellow eyes will be evaluated separately for the primary analysis of the primary efficacy me asure. In addition, analyses using the average IOP

Primary Estima nd 
The primary comparisons in this trial will be between two doses of AKB -9778 (QD and BID) + 
Latanoprost vs Latanoprost monotherapy at the Day 28 Visit in the ITT population with 
intercurrent events handled as described in the following estimand.   
• Popula tion: subjects with Open -Angle Glaucoma or Ocular Hypertension defined through 
enrolment criteria  
• Endpoint: 
- Mean d iurnal (averaged over 08:00, 10:00, 12:00, and 16:00 hour time points)  
change from baseline IOP (mm Hg) at the Day 28 Visit in the study eye 
• Intercurrent event:  
- Discontinuation of study medication  and non- optimal compliance will be ignored 
[treatment policy strategy].  
- Withdrawal due to lack of efficacy or adverse event: missing data will be imputed 
employing Multiple Imputation (MI) assuming missing not at random using: 
▪     Control- based Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methodology 
[hypothetical strategy].  
- Missing data without withdrawal or withdrawal due to reasons other than lack of efficacy or adverse event: missing data will be i mputed employing Multiple 
Imputation (MI) assuming missing at random using randomized treatment -based 
Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methodology [hypothetical strategy]. 
• Population- level summary:  
- The difference in the mean diurnal change from baseline IOP  at the Day 28 Visit, 
between study eyes treated with each dose of AKB -9778 (QD and BID) + 
Latanoprost and study eyes treated with Latanoprost monotherapy. 
Sensitivity analyses will be performed on observed data only and where worst time consistent observa tion within a subject is carried forward for withdrawal due to lack of efficacy or adverse 
event and last time consistent observation within a subject is carried forward for other missing data.  
The primary analysis of the primary outcome will employ a linear model with  Day 28 mean 
diurnal change from baseline IOP as the response, baseline mean diurnal IOP (mean diurnal IOP 
on Day -1) as a covariate, and treatment as a main effect factor, using the intent to treat population with multiple imputation techniqu es (e.g., Monte Carlo Markov Chain) used to 
impute missing data. The least squares mean differences (test – control) between AKB -9778 + 
Latanoprost and Latanoprost monotherapy will be presented as well as 2 -sided p-values and 95% 
confidence intervals. Inference wil l be made on the p- value < 0.05.

Page 68 of 89  Analyses will be performed primarily on the  ITT population using multiple imputation 
techniques to impute missing data and secondarily using: observed data only, last observation 
carried forward (LOCF) where LOCF will be performed using time -relevant measures; and 
baseline observation carried forward (BOCF) using time- relevant measures to determine the 
robustness of results. Additionally, the above analyses will be repeated on the PP population to determine robustness of results.  Additional imputation techniques may be designated in the formal Statistical Analysis Plan . 
Secondary analyses of the primary endpoint will be completed using individual two- sample t - 
tests and 95% t -distribution confidence intervals at each time p oint (08:00, 10:00, and 16:00 at 
the Day 14, and Day 28 Visits) using the ITT population. Similar analyses will be completed on the secondary endpoints: mean IOP measure at each time point and visit and mean diurnal IOP and change from baseline diurnal IOP measures. Models adjusting for baseline will only be performed on the mean IOP response variable as inference is identical between this response and the change from baseline IOP response variable in such a model.  
Additionally, for the mean IOP values at each time point, mixed model repeated measures will be run with baseline as the covariate; treatment, visit, time point, treatment by [CONTACT_765], treatment by [CONTACT_7206], visit by [CONTACT_7206], and treatment by [CONTACT_386111]; and subject as the random effect, repeated measure. An unstructured covariance structure will be used to model the within subject, between visit and time point variances. This allows for different variances and covariances within and between time points and visits. The treatment by [CONTACT_765], treatment by [CONTACT_7206], visit by [CONTACT_7206], and treatment by [CONTACT_386112] a different rate of change in IOP in the different treatment arms among visits and time points. This model will be run including the Day 14, and Day 28 visits. 
Percent change from diurnally adjusted baseline IOP at each time point will be analyzed using 
two-sample t -tests, between AKB -9778 and each comparator, at each time point and visit, 
including two- sample t -tests and 9 5% t-distribution confidence intervals on the difference (AKB-
9778 – comparator).  
Mean diurnal IOP values will be constructed by [CONTACT_113116] 4 diurnal IOP measurements on each of the Day 14, and Day 28 visits. Mean diurnal baseline IOP will be constructe d as the 
average of the four Day -1 IOP measurements. Mean change from mean baseline diurnal IOP 
will be created by [CONTACT_391800] 14, and Day 28 visits 
and subtracting the single mean baseline diurnal IOP measure ment.  
Sub-group analyses based upon pre- study characteristics such as site, demographics, or pre- 
study ocular hypotensive medications may be completed to further investigate the efficacy measures.

collection forms.  The CRFs must be signed by [CONTACT_737] (for electronic CRFs, they can be signed electronically) or by [CONTACT_391802] e data contained on the 
CRFs is true.  Any corrections to entries made in the CRFs and source documents must be dated, initialed and explained (if necessary) and should not obscure the original entry.  
In most cases, the source documents are contained in the subject’s chart at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_225945]'s office.  In these cases, data collected on the CRFs must match the data in those charts.  
In some cases, the CRFs, or part of the CRFs, may also serve as source documents.  In these cases, a document should be available at both the Investigator’s site and at the Sponsor or its designee that clearly identify those data that will be recorded in the CRFs, and for which the CRF will stand as the source document.  
13.[ADDRESS_491944] Retention  
To enable evaluations and/or audits from regulatory authorities or the Sponsor, the Investigator agrees to keep records, including the identity of all participating subjects (sufficient information to link records, e.g., CRFs and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097]), all original signed Infor med Consent Forms, 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_4600], SAE forms, source documents, detailed records of drug disposition, and adequate documentation of relevant correspondence ( e.g., letters, meeting minutes, telephone 
calls reports).  The records should be retained by [CONTACT_391803] (ICH), local regulations, or as specified in the Clinical Study Agreement, whichever time period is longer. 
If the Investigator becomes unable for any reason to continue to retain study records for the 
required period ( e.g., retirement, relocation), the Sponsor should be prospectively notified.  The 
study records must be transferred to a designee acceptable to the Sponsor, such as another Investigator, another institution, or to the Sponsor.  The Investigator must obtain Sponsor’s written permission before disposing of any records, even if retention requirements have been met.

1 INDICATIONS AND  [LOCATION_003]GE  
 
XALATAN is indicated for the reduction of elevated intraocular pressure in patients with open-
angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. 
 
2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION 
 
The recommended dosage is one drop in the affected eye(s) once daily in the evening. If one 
dose is missed , treatment should continue with the next dose as normal. 
 The dosage of XALATAN should not exceed once daily; the combined use of two or more prostaglandins, or prostaglandin analogs including XALATAN is not recommended. It has been shown that administration of these prostaglandin drug products more than once daily may decrease the intraocular pressure (IOP) lowering effect or cause paradoxical elevations in IOP.  
 
Reduction of the IOP starts approximately [ADDRESS_491961] five (5) minutes apart. Contact [CONTACT_391811], and may be reinserted 15 minutes after administration

Patient Counseling Information (17) ]. 
 
5.2 Eyelash Changes 
 
XALATAN may gradually change eyelashes and vellus hair in the treated eye; these changes 
include increased length, thickness, pi[INVESTIGATOR_371], the number of lashes or hairs, and misdirected growth of eyelashes. Eyelash changes are usually reversible upon discontinuation of treatment [see Patient Counseling Information (17) ]. 
 5.3 Intraocular Inflammation 
 
XALATAN should be used with caution in patients with a history of intraocular inflammation (iritis/uveitis) and should generally not be used in patients with active intraocular inflammation because inflam mation may be exacerbated.

Latanoprost is a colorless to sligh tly yellow oil that is very soluble in acetonitrile and freely 
soluble in acetone, ethanol, ethyl acetate, isopropanol, methanol, and octanol. It is practically insoluble in water.  
 
XALATAN ® (latanoprost ophthalmic solution) 0.005% is supplied as a sterile, isotonic, 
buffered aqueous solution of latanoprost with a pH of approximately 6.7 and an osmolality of approximately 267 mOsmol/kg. Each mL of XALATAN contains [ADDRESS_491972]. Benzalkonium chloride, 0.02% is added as a preservative. The inactive i ngredients are: sodium 
chloride, sodium dihydrogen phosphate monohydrate, disodium hydrogen phosphate anhydrous, 
and water for injection. One drop contains approximately 1.[ADDRESS_491973] that is believed to reduce the intraocular 
pressure (IOP) by [CONTACT_386131]. Studies in animals and man suggest that the main  
mechanism of action is increased uveoscleral ou tflow. Elevated IOP represents a major risk 
factor for glaucomatous field loss. The higher the level of IOP, the greater the likelihood of optic nerve damage and visual field loss.

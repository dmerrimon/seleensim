The	dose	is	.005	mL	of	dexamethasone	9%	(equivalent	to	517	micrograms)	Duration	of	subjects	participation		Patients	scheduled	to	undergo	bilateral	cataract	surgery	will	be	screened	and	have	dry	eye	testing.		If	enrolled	in	the	study,	patients	will	have	dry	eye	testing	at	[ADDRESS_1017026]	dry	eye	signs	including	decreased	tear	break	up	time	(63%)	and	positive	corneal	staining	(77%).	Second,	patients	experience	an	increase	in	dry	eye	symptoms	after	cataract	surgery	compared	to	baseline.	Third,	Snellen	visual	acuity	and	contrast	sensitivity	are	impacted	by	[CONTACT_743826].				The	objective	of	this	clinical	research	is	to	evaluate	whether	the	signs	and	symptoms	of	dry	eye	after	cataract	surgery	improve	with	the	addition	of	a	DEXYCU	intraocular	injection.		1.2 Investigational/Study	Product	DEXYCU	contains	dexamethasone	9%	as	a	sterile	suspension	for	intraocular	ophthalmic	administration.		DEXYCU	is	provided	as	a	kit	for	administration	of	a	single	dose	of	0.005	mL	of	9%	dexamethasone.				1.3	Preclinical	Data			Not	applicable.		1.4	Clinical	Data	to	Date		Clinical	efficacy	was	evaluated	in	a	randomized,	double	masked,	placebo	controlled	trial	(NCT2006888)	in	which	subjects	received	either	DEXYCU	or	placebo	(vehicle).		A	dose	of	5	microliters	of	DEXYCU	or	vehicle	was	administered	by	[CONTACT_743827].		The	primary	efficacy	endpoint	for	the	study	was	the	proportion	of	patients	with	anterior	chamber	cell	clearing	on	postoperative	day	8.		The	percentage	of	patients	with	anterior	chamber	clearing	at	Day	8	was	2-%	in	the	placebo	group,	and	57%,	and	60%	in	the	342	and	517	microgram	treatment	groups.		1.5	Dose	Rationale			See	section	1.4		1.6	Risk/Benefits		The	following	adverse	events	rates	are	derived	from	three	clinical	trials	in	which	[ADDRESS_1017027]	commonly	reported	adverse	reactions	occurred	in	5-15%	of	subjects	and	included	increases	in	intraocular	pressure,	corneal	edema,	and	iritis.		Other	ocular	adverse	reactions	occurring	in	1-5%	of	subjects	included,	corneal	endothelial	cell	loss,	blepharitis,	eye	pain,	cystoid	macular	edema,	dry	eye,	ocular	inflammation,	posterior	capsular	opacification,	blurred	vision,	reduced	visual	acuity,	vitreous	floaters,	foreign	body	sensation,	photophobia,	and	vitreous	detachment.

Purpose  
Hypot
hesis: #1The use of the BalanceBelt™ will provide differential information about body sway movements 
during specific clinical balance and gait tasks in patients with CSD that is not currently available through 
routine measures.  
Hypot
hesis: #2 The use of the BalanceBelt™ will provide for a more rapid rate of reduction in patient 
symptoms compared to the historical data from the traditional habituation therapy method. 
Aim
s, purpose, or objectives:  #[ADDRESS_214713] 
information about the subtle changes in posture and gait that are thought to occur in patients with CS D with the 
tractors turned off.  The goal of this portion of the study will be to improve diagnostic strategies for CSD. 
Aim
s, purpose, or objectives:  #[ADDRESS_214714] the benefits of a 1- week 
intensive rehabilitation p rogram using the BalanceBeltTM with tactors activated in 10 patients with CSD.  The 
goal of this study will be to develop a treatment that is quicker and more effective than current therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. 
Bac
kground ( Include relevant experience, gaps in current knowledge, preliminary data, etc .):  
Chroni
c subjective dizziness (CSD) is the second most common condition identified in patients referred to 
Mayo Clinic for persistent dizziness. We manage nearly [ADDRESS_214715] ent non-vertiginous dizziness and unsteadiness that may be worsened by [CONTACT_1962]’ own motion, 
exposure challenging visual stimuli such as busy shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_181896], or performance of precision visual tasks such as reading.  CSD develops in about 25% of patients f ollowing medical events that acutely disrupt balance. Once 
established, CSD may last for many years, even if the problems that triggered it resolves.  As a result, CSD causes considerable distress and functional impairment, even to the extent of work disability and disruption of family and social life (Staab, 2012).   
Over
 the last decade, the Mayo Clinic Integrated Neurotology team, and other investigators around the world 
have developed two treatment strategies for CSD.  One uses serotonergic medications  such as sertraline (Zoloft) 
and venlafaxine (Effexor).  The other is a variation of vestibular and balance exercises known as vestibular habituation.  These therapi[INVESTIGATOR_181897] 60-80% of patients when administered by [CONTACT_181905] [IRB [ZIP_CODE].004]  Effective August 28, 2012  
 Page 2 of 8 (St
aab, 2012).  However, they have important shortcomings.  They are time-consuming, taking a minimum of 2-
[ADDRESS_214716] results.  They usually achieve a partial reduction in symptoms, 
which improves patients’ functioning, but falls short of a cure.  They can make patients worse, rather than better, when used by [CONTACT_181906].  
A new
 theory about altered postural control mechanisms in CSD suggests that it could be diagnosed more 
accurately and treated more quickly by [CONTACT_181907]. A suitable prosthesis is the BalanceBelt
TM, which is currently in final beta testing by 
[CONTACT_181908], the company that developed it.  This device has  been shown to have efficacy in reducing sway 
behavior in patients that have bilateral vestibular hypofunction (Sienko et al, 2010). For those patients with deficient vestibular systems the belt provides information that is missing from the lack of vestibu lar system cues 
for detecting sway or leaning behavior, hence drawing attention to the information that is missing. The BalanceBelt
TM is a comfortable, self -contained unit worn under the clothes around the waist.  It has sensitive 
motion detectors and small tactors that vibrate against the skin at four locations to provide information about posture and motion.  Patients with CSD do not have permanent vestibular deficits, but underutilize vestibular signals because they develop visual or somatosensory dependence.  We expect the BalanceBelt
TM to reset this 
error by [CONTACT_181909].   
We pr
opose two preliminary studies using the BalanceBeltTM in patients with CSD.  In the first study, we will 
use the motion detectors contained i n the BalanceBeltTM to record information about the subtle changes in 
posture and gait that are thought to occur in patients with CSD.  This goal of this study will be to improve diagnostic strategies for CSD.  We will compare postural movements recorded w ith BalanceBelt
TM with tactors 
turned off during quiet stance, normal walking (Dynamic Gait Index), functional reach test, and the Sensory Organization Test in [ADDRESS_214717] the benefits of a 1 -week intensive rehabilitation program using the BalanceBelt
TM with 
tactors activated in 10 patients with CSD.  The goal of this study will be to develop a treatment that is quicker and more effective than current therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].

Minimal Risk Protocol Template [IRB [ZIP_CODE].004]  Effective August 28, [ADDRESS_214718] population:  20 patients with diagnosis of Chronic Subjective Dizziness (CSD) and 10 normal 
volunteers. 
In
clusion Criteria:  1. Subjects will be 25-[ADDRESS_214719] CSD as their primary diagnosis  for the cause of their balance and
dizziness complaints provided by [CONTACT_181911], a division of the 
Department of Psychiatry & Psychology. 
3. Normal volunteers will have a negative history of otologic & neurologic disorders and
no history of dizziness and balance problems. 
4. Normal volunteers will have normal findings on a screening office examination for
peripheral and central vestibular system involvement (see methods for details of the examination) and screening for normal or symmetrical hearing loss of explainable origin.  
Ex
clusion Criteria:   1. Patients with positive indications from testing of peripheral and/or central vestibular 
system involvement that is felt to be influencing the symptoms reported beyond t he CSD alone.  
2. Patients with mobility restriction that would prevent participating in the tests or the
intensive therapy trials.  
3. Subjects with hearing impairment that interferes with oral communication.

thods: Describe, in detail, the research activities that will be conducted under this protocol :  
For
 Hypothesis and aim #1: Ten consecutive patients, ages 25-70 years, diagnosed with CSD a fter completion 
of their routine evaluation in the Dizziness and Balance disorders laboratory and their evaluation by  [CONTACT_181912], would then be recruited for participation in the study. If they agree to participate they w ill individually be placed through the following evaluations while wearing the 
BalanceBelt™ with the tractors turned off but the recording elements turned on. Each of these tests is  a standard 
evaluation tool used in the Vestibular and Balance Laboratory on a routine basis:  
1.Dy
namic Gait Index – evaluates gait under normal walking and under conditions of head turns, walking
around two objects on the floor, steppi[INVESTIGATOR_181898] a shoe box, walking at different speeds, walking with astop and [ADDRESS_214720] in #[ADDRESS_214721] – the subject stands in a stationary position and reaches out with a single arm asfar as they can without taking a step. Here again the physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_181899] o f the test, again with the subject in the harness used in #3 with the hand
grab to prevent falls.
Minimal Risk Protocol Template [IRB [ZIP_CODE].004]  Effective August 28, [ADDRESS_214722] – this is a [ADDRESS_214723] movement in the A/P dimension while the sensory inputs from
proprioception and vision are varied through the platform and visual surround movements. The subjectwears a full chest harness that is fastened to a roll bar above the subject to prevent any falls.
For
 each of the patients an age and gender matched normal (± 5 years) volunteer will go through the same 
evaluations. The time for testing will take 45 minutes. Normal subjects will be recruited through written advertisements from visitors and / or accompanying persons for patients to Mayo Clinic.  Each of the normal 
subjects will go through an office vestibular examination that will consist of direct monitoring for nystagmus in all positions of gaze with and without visual fixation present. They will also undergo the head thrust test with visual fixation present and headshake test with visual fixation absent. Pursuit and saccade office examination will be performed with a hearing screening by [CONTACT_181913]. If any abnormalities are revealed with the screening the nor mal volunteer will be advised as to formal testing that should be performed via their primary 
care physician also being notified.  
For
 Hypothesis and aim #2: Ten consecutive patients, ages 25-[ADDRESS_214724] time of the [COMPANY_002]ster Mayo campus will be asked to participate in the habituation therapy activities typi[INVESTIGATOR_181900]. The patients will be using the BalanceB elt™ with the tractors activated. The typi[INVESTIGATOR_181901]- therapy will be taken in addition to Visual Analog Scales related to the intensity of symptoms 
provoked by [CONTACT_181914], head movements and walking in visually complex environments. The se same 
measures will be taken at the end of the week of intensive therapy at a return visit to check their exercise activities prior to continuing their progressive home treatment. The one week of intensive therapy will be performed prior to starting any recommended medications or medication changes for the CSD. The therapy will 
be conducted by [CONTACT_181915][INVESTIGATOR_181902].  
Fo
llowing the intensive therapy the patient will continue with the therapy activities and medication trials as is 
standard currently for the CSD patients. 
Res
ources: Describe the available resources to conduct the research (personnel, time, facilities, mentor 
commitment, etc.) :

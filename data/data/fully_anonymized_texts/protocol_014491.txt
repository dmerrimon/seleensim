Research Question and Aims  
 
Specific Aims and Hypotheses  
Aim 1.   Determine if prospective measures can identify patient risk profiles for second ACL injury by 
[CONTACT_269346].  Hypothesis 1A: Landing biomechanics (vGRF, frontal and transverse plane hip moments, frontal plane knee and hip motion, and asymmetrical sagittal plane knee moments), quadriceps and hamstrings strength and single leg postural stability will effectively identify discrete patient risk profiles for second injury based on knee abduction (KAA) and hip adduction angles (HAA), surrogates for ACL injury. Aim 2.   Determine the effects of differential rehabilitation, including the impact on biomechanical measures of 
ACL injury risk and return to sport readiness after ACLR. Hypothesis 2A: Changes in hip and knee kinematics and kinetics (frontal and transverse plane hip moment, frontal plane knee motion, and sagittal plane knee motion) will vary by [CONTACT_1570], with the greatest changes occurring in the Targeted neuromuscular training (TNMT ) > Standard of care ( STAN ) > HOME 
groups. Hypothesis 2B: Changes in clinical performance measures (hop symmetry; quadriceps and hip abductor Note: If this study establishes a human specimen repository (biobank) for research

greatest changes in the TNMT > STAN > HOME groups.  
Exploratory Aim.  Develop a clinical algorithm that classifies patient risk for second ACL injury.  
Hypothesis EA:  Clinical tests of strength (quadriceps and hamstrings), balance, 2D jump landing mechanics (frontal and sagittal plane knee angle), and knee laxity) will effectively identify patient risk for second ACL injury. 
Background  
Importance of the problem . Second ACL injury, whether it is an insult to the ipsilateral graft or the contralateral 
ligament, is a growing problem after reconstruction. Besides missing an additional year of athletic participation, increasing health care costs, and increased psychological distress, re-injury and subsequent revision surgery have significantly worse outcomes compared with those after initial reconstruction.

been reported to occur at a rate of 1 in 17 (6%) within the first two years of surgery.26 However, a second tear 
prevalence of 29% has been reported.5-7, 27 This is substantially higher than initial ACL injuries, reported to 
occur at a rate of 1 in 60 to 100.28, 29 Risk factors for second injury include younger athletes 6 who return to 
high- level sporting activities early. 27, 30 Both sexes are at risk for second ACL injury, with females reported as 
having higher risk of contralateral injury,15, 26 and males having an increased risk of ipsilateral injury.8, 31, 32 
Thus, it is critical to include both sexes in second ACL injury prevention programs. 
Improvement in scientific knowledge and clinical practice: Patients have differential responses after 
ACL injury, including their functional abilities, movement biomechanics, neuromuscular performance, and quadriceps strength.
18, 19, 33- [ADDRESS_327717] groups with differing levels of risk for second injury (Aim 1). Our previous work revealed that there were three risk groups among uninjured female athletes. The significance of identification of patient groups with distinct needs is profound.

The Cincinnati group

described this differentiation in ACL deficient patients as the ‘rule of thirds,’ with one third of patients able to function without limitations and not needing to undergo surgical stabilization, one third adapting their activity level without surgery, and one third requiring surgery to perform daily activities without knee instability.

has demonstrated the existence of discernable groups of athletes that are more appropriate for targeted neuromuscular training (TNMT) intervention to prevent first -time ACL injury.  
 Factors that contribute to primary ACL injury risk provide an important window into the underlying deficits that may persist after ACL injury and reconstruction. Age and activity level are significant factors, as young active individuals are the most likely cohort to sustain a second ACL rupture.

15 These parameters predicted second injury in this 
population with excellent sensitivity (0.92) and specificity (0.88).  
Differences in functional abilities after ACLR may be differentiated by [CONTACT_269348]. Clinically measured muscle weakness may persist for years after ACLR. Quadriceps strength is strongly related to measurements of knee function in athletes who have undergone ACLR.

R01AR055563/MayoWork/Protocol_17.00602500_08_27_2020.doc  Page [ADDRESS_327723]- ACLR movement patterns for both limbs are critical not only to maximize functional recovery but 
also to reduce the risk for second ACL injury. Though neuromuscular training programs result in a 73.4% 
decreased risk of a non -contact [CONTACT_157855] -ACL injury compared to those who do not participate in neuromuscular 
training55, the efficacy of similar programs for reduction of second -ACL injury risk has not been examined.  
An evidence-based targeted neuromuscular training (TNMT) program has been designed to reduce the 
incidence of second ACL injury. This training program was developed with consideration to modifiable factors related to second- injury risk, the principles of motor learning, and careful selection of the exercises that may 
most effectively modify aberrant neuromuscular programs. In Aims [ADDRESS_327724] savings for patients and the health- care system.  
  
Study Design and Methods  
 
Methods  
Overall Strategy . This is a prospective, randomized, repeated measures single- blind clinical trial. The purposes 
of this study are to 1) stratify patient risk for second ACL injury, and 2) determine the effects of differential treatment intervention, including targeted neuromuscular training (TNMT), home program only (HOME) and standard clinical (STAN) training, on clinical, biomechanical, and neuromuscular performance measures associated with an increased secondary ACL injury risk. At this time there is no evidence to support one intervention as either superior or inferior to the other interventions proposed in this study.  After the initial ACL injury and study enrollment, all patients will participate in standardized pre- operative rehabilitation. They will 
then undergo surgery by a fellowship-trained sports medicine surgeon at Mayo Clinic, [COMPANY_002]ster, MN. Data for Aim [ADDRESS_327725] andards identified in the literature for entry into the final phase of 
rehabilitation.  These criteria include : symmetrical knee range of motion; minimal or no pain and knee effusion; 
quadriceps strength ≥ 80% compared to contralateral limb (180°/sec and 300°/sec); self -report of function ≥ 
80%; limb symmetry index during single leg hop for distance ≥ 80%. Both pre - and postoperative rehabilitation 
protocols are a composite of previously published, evidence- based protocols from expert researchers and 
clinic ians.
65-67  
 
Differential Rehabilitation .  Once study participants are cleared for full participation in sports , they will be 
randomized into one of three groups for differential treatment. This will include HOME, STAN and TNMT

25, providing verbal and visual feedback 
and performance of single leg drills on both legs.  
Augmented feedback is a key treatment feature for the TNMT group. Feedback will be provided for 
appropriate exercises, including dynamic jumpi[INVESTIGATOR_007], steppi[INVESTIGATOR_269332]. Structured feedback has been shown to promote positive changes in jump landing biomechanics.
57-61 Specific feedback will be provided 
regarding toe to heel landing, landing on both feet at the same time, landing with feet hip width apart, knees over the midfoot, landing with knee flexion > 30°, trunk in front of hips, and no lateral trunk flexion.
57  Real 
time and delayed movement feedback will be provided using a commercially available system (Dartfish, Alpharetta, GA) to capture two -dimensional kinematics, and a force plate (Bertec Corp., Columbus, OH) to 
capture vertical ground reaction forces. The use of expert video feedback utilizing a standardized movement checklist has been shown to improve lower extremity dynamics during jump landing activities including a reduction in vertical ground reaction forces and increases in sagittal plane angular knee displacement.
[ADDRESS_327727]’s physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541].[ADDRESS_327728] will determine if an anterior or lateral video view is appropriate for providing the visual necessary feedback. For each of the TNMT exercises there will be four phases. The three treatment sessions in each phase will match the three phases of motor learning (cognitive, associative and autonomous).  
aNMT (augmented NeuroMuscular Training) training. A 12- session, return to sport training program 
were modified from prior investigations to include real- time aNMT biofeedback. aNMT biofeedback training 
will consist of 2 sets of 10 repetitions per session with a progression in volume as exercise intensity increases (Squat: 40 repetitions during weeks 1- 2; Pi[INVESTIGATOR_269333], 40 repetitions during week 3- 4, Overhead Squat, 80 
repetitions during weeks 5- 6) over the 6- week training period. aNMT biofeedback maps the values of key 
biomechanical variables, computed continuously in real -time, to a geometric shape that athletes view via a 
heads -up display consisting of a high -resolution screen fixed in a constant position in the eye’s field of view. 
The biomechanical variables —selected based on our prior NIH -funded research that identified them as 
contributing injury risk factors —include: 1) Lateral trunk flexion (optimal = 0°), 2) Knee to hip sagittal plane 
moment ratio (<1), 3) Knee abduction moment (≤0 Nm), 4) Foot placement (1:1 ratio to hip width) 5) VGRF ratio (1:1 ratio between limbs) and 6) Landing position.  
The desired outcome for athletes to achieve while performing each intervention exercise is to move so as 
to produce a rectangular shape and make the shape as large as possible. This is achieved when each targeted

 biomechanical variable is at the desired value. Deviations of the variables from desired values result in specific 
and systematic changes to the feedback shape: 1) Lateral trunk flexion causes the object to lean to the respective side, 2) Inverse dynamics will determine the hip to knee sagittal plane moment ratio; reduced relative hip moment contributions shrink the shape and larger ratios make it bigger, 3) Knee abduction moment changes cause the stimulus to pi[INVESTIGATOR_820] (excessive valgus) or expand (excessive varus) at the middle, 4) Foot position changes the width of the stimulus base; feet too close together causes the base to be narrower than the top and too far apart causes it to be wider than the top, 5) VGRF asymmetry causes the corner of increased load to drop, and 6) The stimulus translates left or right if landing position deviates laterally from a target on the floor. After 
receiving basic instruction about how to accomplish the exercises, athletes must discover the movement pattern 
that produces a stimulus shape as close to the desired rectangle as possible and maintain the stimulus in a large rectangular shape as best as she can on each repetition. No explicit directions will be provided to athletes on their movement other than to achieve the goal shape. Based on our preliminary studies, we expect that the aNMT protocol will be especially beneficial to an athlete who can respond to self- guided, implicit learning 
strategies to correct multiple deficits that are likely cumulative in the exacerbation of injury risk. Given the automated, objectively prescribed mappi[INVESTIGATOR_269334], there is no interaction between the technician and the stimulus during aNMT delivery. This ensures blinding of the technician.  
Biomechanical Testing Protocol  Testing will be conducted at Mayo Clinic, prior to clinical testing. This portion 
of the data collection session will last approximately one hour. Testing will include collection of three-dimensional kinematic data with a high -speed, 10- camera motion capture system collected at 240 Hz (Motion 
Analysis, Santa Clara CA). Kinetic data will be collected at 1200 Hz from two force plates (Bertec, Columbus, OH) embedded into the floor and synchronized with motion data. We have demonstrated excellent reliability in our sagittal- and frontal- plane hip and knee mechanics both within and between testing sessions. We have 
excellent intraclass correlations in knee flexion angles and moments (0.933; 0.926 respectively), knee abduction angles and moments (0.993; 0.931 respectively), knee internal rotation (0.971; 0.666 respectively).

referenced in relation to this position.  
Dynamic task descriptions 
  Drop vertical jump (DVJ): Subjects will begin the protocol by [CONTACT_269349] a box (height of 31cm) with their feet 35 cm apart. Subjects will then drop off the box (without jumpi[INVESTIGATOR_007]) and land with their feet on the floor below, followed immediately by a maximum vertical jump with an overhead target. Both of the subject’s feet must land separately on the two adjacent platforms, and a staggered foot fall to initiate the drop jump must be avoided. Five acceptable trials will be collected and post -processed.  
Single cross- over drop (COD):  To test the right lower extremity, subjects will stand on the right side of the top 
of box (height of 31cm) with their left foot. Subjects will be asked ‘hop’ off the box, crossing the midline of their body and landing with their right foot on the force plate to their left, holding the position for 3 seconds. A double hop on the landing (where the foot loses contact [CONTACT_269350]) or the lack of a 3-second hold following the jump will not be utilized in the analysis. Five acceptable trials will be collected.  
Single leg drop (SLD):  Subjects will stand on a box (height of 31cm) on one foot. Subjects will be asked to drop 
off the box (without jumpi[INVESTIGATOR_007]), landing with their foot on the force plate below, and hold the position for 3

 seconds. A double hop on the landing (where the foot loses contact [CONTACT_269350]) or the lack of a 3-
second hold following the jump will not be utilized in the analysis. Five acceptable trials will be collected.  
Countermovement jump (CMJ):  Subjects will stand on the floor with feet shoulder width apart. Subjects will be 
asked to squat down and execute a maximal vertical jump in one fluid movement. Five acceptable trials will be collected.  
Single leg postural balance  will be assessed using force plates. Two  force plate s (Bertec, Columbus, OH) will 
be used to measure static and dynamic bilateral and unilateral postural stability under eyes open and eyes closed conditions. During testing subjects will stand on one foot on the force plate sensor for 30 seconds with opposite 
knee flexed to 90° and the hands positioned on the hips. During the trial, COP path length, COP path velocity, 
and mean COP sway (limit of stability) will be recorded. Each task will be performed three times and the average of the three scores will be utilized for statistical analysis.  
 These movements are common sport activities and ones that can be completed safely in a controlled laboratory environment, posing no more risk than would be assumed during normal sports participation.  
Data Analysis: Standard International Society of Biomechanics (ISB) conventions for calculating Euler angles 
will be used to describe lower extremity motions (Figure 2B).74 From the standing trial, a kinematic model 
comprised of twelve skeletal segments and 36 degrees of freedom will be defined using commercial software (Visual 3D, C -Motion, Inc. Germantown, MD). The tracked 3D marker coordinate data recorded for the 
movement trials will be processed with custom software (MATLAB, MathWorks, Inc. Natick, MA) environment through the Visual3D pi[INVESTIGATOR_269335]. These data will be low- pass filtered with a cubic smoothing spline at a 12 Hz cut -off frequency. The ground reaction force 
(GRF) data recorded for each limb will be used to normalize the kinematic data to 100% of stance at 1% increments (N=101), with initial contact [CONTACT_269351] 10N. From the 3D kinematic and force plate data, 3D moments at hip and knee will be computed using inverse dynamic analysis within Visual3D. The 3D moment vector in each joint will be decomposed in three components, each oriented along one of the axes of a standard joint coordinate system. The resulting variables represent the total moment due to muscle, ligament, and contact [CONTACT_269352].  The moment arm and the horizontal distance from the resultant GRF to the knee joint center and COM will be calculated using Visual3D and MATLAB. These variables will be collected simultaneously and imported into the database with the kinematic and kinetic measures. Center of pressure (COP) and the anterior/ posterior, medial/lateral and vertical components of the force platform will be used to estimate the lateral distance between the resultant GRF vector and virtual knee joint center. Visual3D utilizes the geometrical approach to the inertial properties in order that segments are more generalizable to multiple models. The mass proportions of the segments were derived by [CONTACT_269353]
[ADDRESS_327731] the inertia of the body segments 
between hip and ground. The inverse dynamic analysis performed will include all inertial effects.   T wo-dimensional video collection of jump landing mechanics will be collected concurrent to three -
dimensional drop jump (DVJ, SLD, COD , CMJ ) testing.   Continuous two- dimensional data will be collected 
with two digital video cameras (Bosch LLC, Farmington Hills, MI) at 60 Hz.  Cameras will be positioned

analysis will be performed using commercially available software (Dartfish, Alpharetta, GA).  Motions to be evaluated include frontal plane knee and hip angles at initial contact [CONTACT_269354], and knee flexion angle at initial contact.                 
Clinical Testing Protocol. This portion of the data collection session will last approximately two hours.  
A. Subjects will be required to complete self -report questionnaires specific to their current knee function. The 
data will be collected using OBERD (Outcome Based Electronic Research Database), a software system integrated into the Mayo Clinic infrastructure to facilitate collection and consolidation of data.  Questionnaires 
include the Marx Activity Scale (ICC of 0.[ADDRESS_327733] reliability)
79, Tegner scale (ICC of 0.[ADDRESS_327734] reliability)80, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) Subjective Knee Evaluation (ICC 
test-retest reliability of 0.95)81, Knee Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) (ICC test- retest reliability of 0.61 -
0.95)82, Knee Outcome Survey- Activities of Daily Living (KOS -ADLS)  and Sports (KOS- ADL Sports)  (ICC 
test-retest reliability of 0.94) 83 Global Rating score (GRS) (ICC test- retest reliability of 0.88) 84 and the Anterior 
Cruciate Ligament Return to Sport after Injury  (ACL -RSI) (Cronbach’s Alpha= 0.92)91. 
B. Strength will be measured on both limbs using a clinical dynamometer (either Humac, CSMi, Stoughton, 
MA, or Biodex System, Biodex, Shirley, NY).  
1. Isokinetic quadriceps and hamstrings strength: Subjects will be seated on the dynamometer with the hip and knee flexed to 90°. Prior to testing, they will undergo a short warm -up. A test session will consist of 10 
repetitions at slow (180°/sec) and fast (300°/sec) speeds through a knee range of motion of 0- 100°. Peak flexion 
and extension torques will be recorded.  2. Isokinetic hip abduction strength: Subjects will stand in front of the rotating arm of the dynamometer. A test session will consist of two test sets of 5 repetitions at 120°/second moving into abduction. Peak abduction torque will be recorded.  3. Isometric hip abduction strength: Isometric abduction strength will be collected using a custom force sensing strap. Subjects will stand with their feet placed shoulder-width apart, their knees aligned directly above each foot, and hips and knees slightly flexed. A non- stretchable athletic wrap will be secured around the subject’s 
thighs, superior to the femoral condyles and patella, and secured with tape or Velcro. Three practice repetitions will be conducted in which the subjects will maximally abduct their thighs and push out against the wrap. 
5 
maximum efforts will be conducted and recorded. A strain gauge will measure induced voltage and display force output on a monitor. Maximum abduction force in all 5 trials will be recorded.  C. Patient functional performance will be evaluated with a battery of hop tests. Reliability of the unilateral hop tests is good, with ICC coefficients ranging from .
92-.96.85, 86 
1. Single leg hop for distance tests: The limb symmetry indexes (LSIs) for the single hop, cross-over hop, and triple hop tests are all based on the maximum distance jumped with a controlled landing, and performance will be calculated by [CONTACT_269355]. Hop distance will be measured to the nearest centimeter on a standard measuring taped secured to the floor. The maximum hop distance of two trials will be used for analysis.  2. Single leg timed hop: The 6- meter timed hop is a measure of how fast it takes the athlete to hop 6 -meters on 
one leg. A handheld or digital timing system will be used by a trained tester. The 6- meter timed hop LSI will be 
calculated by [CONTACT_269356] (or dominant leg) divided by [CONTACT_269357].  D.  Skeletal maturity will be evaluated with a modified Pubertal Maturation Observational Scale (PMOS).  Maturational categories will include prepubertal (equivalent to Tanner
87, 88 Stage 1), early pubertal (equivalent 
to Tanner Stages 2 and 3) or late or postpubertal (equivalent to Tanner Stages 4 and 5).  The categories are

 based on several indicators of pubertal maturation (growth spurt, menarchal status, body hair, sweating, and 
muscular definition).89  The scale reliably classifies subjects into developmental stages and is based on 
parental/participant report, and investigator observations.90  The reliability of the scale has been demonstrated to 
be high.89 
F.  Passive anterior knee laxity will be captured with a GNRB arthrometer (Genourob, Laval, [LOCATION_009]) or a Blue 
Bay arthrometer (Blue Bay Research Inc, Navarre, FL, [LOCATION_003]) using an automated [ADDRESS_327735] of the tibia or a Blue Bay arthrometer (Blue Bay Research Inc, Navarre, FL, [LOCATION_003]) using a 134 N anterior pull on the tibia .

During the six weeks of training, patients will be contact[CONTACT_269358]. The surveys will include questions of compliance and involvement of sport activities. If the patient prefers, the surveys can be conducted over the phone rather than on the computer. The coordinator will call the patient/guardian if the survey has not been filled out after two notices.  Post training, the patient will receive monthly surveys of injury surveillance for two years. Then yearly follow up for [ADDRESS_327736] blank:

Laboratory.  Patient care and rehabilitation will be provided in Mayo Clinic Sports Medicine Centers (SMCs).   
 Mayo Clinic has recently built two state of the art outpatient Sports Medicine Centers (SMCs) in [COMPANY_002]ster and Minneapolis, MN.  The offices and facilities of the SMCs are dedicated to creating an atmosphere of clinical, research and academic excellence.  All facilities and resources are readily available to [CONTACT_269363], and include 
everything necessary for the successful completion of this proposal. The availability of two sports medicine 
rehabilitation centers within the Mayo Clinic system that provide standardized care enhances the ability to provide patient services to a large geographic region.  Both clinics occupy more than 20,[ADDRESS_327743]. Aaron Krych (PI).  All of the surgery 
providers are participating in the investigation.  This project will utilize the dual clinical spaces available at Mayo Clinic Sports Medicine housed within the Dan Abraham Healthy Living Center (DAHLC) in [COMPANY_002]ster, MN, as well as Mayo Clinic Square in downtown Minneapolis, MN. The DAHLC houses approximately 25,000 square feet of clinical sports medicine treatment space, which includes exam rooms, radiology suite with access to MRI, strength and mobility training equipment, an enclosed turf field, reception area, open office space for staff that is in close proximity to the clinical treatment space. In addition, there is another approximately 13,000 feet of clinical sports medicine space housed in the Charlton Building for a total of approximately 38,000 feet of clinical treatment space in [COMPANY_002]ster, MN. Mayo Clinic Square is comprised of approximately 25,000 square feet of clinical sports medicine treatment space, which includes exam rooms, radiology suite with access to MRI, strength and mobility training equipment, isokinetic/isometric dynamometers, an enclosed turf field, reception area, open office space for staff that is in close proximity to the clinical treatment space. These state of the art facilities will be the site of patient care and rehabilitation following ACL reconstruction surgery.

Subject Information  
 Target accrual:   This study will enroll 150 subjects.  Anticipating a 30% dropout rate, this will yield a final 
accrual of  [ADDRESS_327746] population (children, adults, groups):  All subjects will be patients who undergo primary ACL reconstruction, and will be recruited from the practices of the sports medicine surgical team at Mayo Clinic, [COMPANY_002]ster, MN, as well as the practices of the surgeon affiliates of the sports medicine team at Cincinnati Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_29349], Cincinnati, OH .  Recruitment will also include primary ACL 
reconstruction patients from the sports medicine surgical team at the University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, and primary ACL reconstruction patients from the sports medicine surgical team at Mayo Clinic Health System, La Crosse, WI. This will include male and female patients between the ages of 13 and 30 years in age

HIPAA Identifiers and Protected Health Information (PHI)  
 Protected health information is medical data that can be linked to the subject directly or through a combination of indirect identifiers.  
 
Recording i dentifiers (including a code) during the conduct of the study allows you to return to the medical 
record or data source to delete duplicate subjects, check a missing or questionable entry, add new data points, 
etc. De -identified data is medical information that has been stripped of all HIPAA identifier s so that it cannot be 
linked back to the subject. De- identified data is rarely  used in the conduct of a research study involving a chart 
review.

among the repeated measures, which is likely conservative. Thus, an accrual of 116 (with an estimated 30 % 
dropout rate) subjects will be sufficient to determine if a clinically significant reduction in uninvolved limb transverse plane hip net moment impulse, frontal plane knee joint ROM, initial contact [CONTACT_269359], and deficits of involved limb postural stability has occurred as a result of TNMT. This sample size provides adequate power for all variables of interest for Aims 1 and 2.  Mayo Clinic averages more 
than 120 ACLR per year in the Minneapolis/[COMPANY_002]ster region on individuals under age 25. Thus, the available 
patient pool is more than adequate to meet study requirements.  Data Analysis Plan :  
Aim 1:  We will utilize normal mixture based clustering analysis70 to identify groups with distinguished risks based on a priori covariates (i.e., demographics and biomechanical variables). Our previous work used a similar approach to effectively cluster subjects into three distinct risk groups. We intend to confirm disparate risk for injury by [CONTACT_269360], surrogates for ACL injury.    The normal mixture model approach works by [CONTACT_269361] a subject x, can be described as:  
 
 where (i) K  is the number of mixture components (groups), (ii) 
 is the unconditional probability that a subject 
fall into the kth group, and (iii) 
  is the multivariate normal density with mean 
  and covariance 
 . 
Estimates of the parameters, 
 are typi[INVESTIGATOR_269345]. The number of 
groups is most commonly chosen to optimize the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). Often assumptions such as a common covariance matrix for all k , or common shape (i.e., correlation) matrix, are made to make 
estimation feasible, depending on the size of data, and these decisions are also commonly made on the basis of 
BIC. In this work we intend to assume a common 
, and assess the validity of this assumption via model 
diagnostics. Once parameter estimates are obtained, clustering is performed by [CONTACT_269362] m for a given subject, conditional on his/her covariate values, i.e.,  
 
 
The subject will then be assigned to the group k that results in the largest conditional group membership 
probability 
 . This approach has been shown to perform very well in the presence of a large 
number of variables with the inclusion of a variable selection mechanism.71, [ADDRESS_327750] informatively 
differentiate the subjects.

  is the interaction effect allowing intervention efficacy to 
vary with intervention type. The fixed effects are constrained such that

baseline (i.e., pre- treatment) response for an individual is:  
 
 
 Thus, the pre - intervention response for a given subject is the same regardless of which intervention group 
 
they were assigned to, since nothing would have happened yet within their intervention group to distinguish them from other groups. Under the formulation in (1), the difference between observations before and after 
intervention is:  
 
 
 where 
, 
 , and 
 . The primary inference of interest is with 
respect to the relative efficacy of rehabilitation type 
  and the effect of risk group on intervention efficacy, 
along with their interaction 
 . Thus, this inference could equivalently be conducted using the pairwise 
differences in a straightforward one -way ANOVA model. We will assess model assumptions (e.g., normality 
and constant variance) via residual diagnostics and apply transformations if needed. Where appropriate, we will 
also utilize Tukey HSD post hoc analysis to further determine significance between groups on intervention effect.

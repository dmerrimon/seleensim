1. STUDY PLAN 
 Constraint -induced Movement Therapy (CIMT) is a family of  techniques that has 
systematically applied intensive treatment daily over consecutive days, supervised  
motor training using a technique called shapi[INVESTIGATOR_007], behavioral strategies  to improve the 
use of  the affected limb in real life situations called a Transfer Package (TP),  and the 
use of strategies to  remind participants to use the affected extremity;  including 
restraint  of the non- affected  arm. Studies  have shown robust evidence on the effect 
of CIMT in increasing the amount and the quality of use of the paretic UE  in daily 
situations  of individuals  with stroke.  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_605575], clinical 
application of ClMT has been challenging. Barriers  for its implementation in clinical 
settings include time needed  by [CONTACT_2111][INVESTIGATOR_11437],  other resources  required and lack of 
payment  for the services. With regards to  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437]' time, in the traditional Cl MT 
protocol, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_605576] 3.5 hours daily (except for  weekends) for 
a [ADDRESS_802010] cases, patients 
pay for the treatment privately (with little or no insurance reimbursement).  Such 
practices severely limit the number of patients who have access to ClMT. Two lines  of 
evidence have suggested that an alternative Cl MT protocol may allow for the essential  
(or "Key") elements  to be delivered in a schedule that better  utilizes therapi[INVESTIGATOR_605577].  One line 
of evidence comes from findings  that indicate that the original 6 -hour supervised 
training schedule could be shortened to as little as 2- hours/daily  without a reduction 
in outcomes. Additional evidence comes from a study exploring the systematic  
addition and deletion of the traditional Cl therapy protocol elements indicated that 
when the transfer package was omitted, outcomes related to functional use were 
reduced by  50%.  These findings were also verified by  [CONTACT_605590] a much- reduced  level of brain remodeling in those not 
receiving  the transfer  package. These findings  highlight  the potential effectiveness of  
the transfer package and continued functional training by [CONTACT_605591]. Therefore, the Keys treatment protocol was developed, providing a distributed schedule (1 to  4 times/  week  over an 8- week  period)  instead of 
consecutively  over a 12- day treatment period.  Also, patients would be exposed to the 
behavioral component of the protocol, the transfer package, for an extended period (Figure 1).

Project Design and Methods  
• Participants:  10 participants  with chronic stroke were included in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_2284]. Individuals were included if they (1) were age 18 years or older; (2) 
had a stroke at least 6 months prior to enrollment; (3) were able to 
demonstrate minimum movement criteria of more- affected UE including [ADDRESS_802011] extension (starting from a fully flexed position), 10 degrees of thumb abduction, and 10 degrees of extension of two additional fingers at all joints; (4) scored less than 2.5 on the Motor  Activity Log 
(MAL); (5) achieved score of 24 or higher on the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE); (6) demonstrated the ability to comprehend and 
answer the Motor Activity Log (MAL) questions; and (7) had not received a 
botulin toxin injection or adjustm ents in anti -spasticity drug regimens within 
3 months of treatment. Sensory deficits were not an exclusion. Individuals 
who were not fluent in English were excluded from the study.  
• Outcome  Measures:  Aim 1 will be assessed using the MAL (Arm use),  
WMFT  (Arm  capacity), SIS (Quality  of Life),  ZDS (Depression) and COPM 
(Functional activity preference, ability and satisfaction).  All measures will 
be administered immediately pre
- t
reatment, at  the end of the 4th week of 
the intervention (middle of treatment), and at post -treatment. The MAL, 
SIS, ZDS , and the COPM  will also be administered at  [ADDRESS_802012] -
intervention  by [CONTACT_756]. 
• Intervention:  All participants will receive the Keys intervention protocol 
over an 8- week intervention period.  Specific Cl therapy  strategies  will be 
delivered as  previously described' except for  the following 
modifications: 1) supervised training for 1.5 hours  (i.e., 2 shapi[INVESTIGATOR_91993]), 
gradually decreasing the number of  weekly session over the course of 8 

weeks  with 4 days/week  for the first 4 weeks,  2 days/week  for weeks  5 
and 6, and 1 day/week  for weeks  7 and 8; 2) participants  will use the 
restraint  mitt on their less- affected  UE for most  of their waking hours  for 
the 8 week  period;  3) transfer  package methods  will be modified  to 
accommodate the longer  time period between clinic  visits;  and 4) 
participants  will be asked to independently  perform  additional  
movement training for 30 minutes  each day at home.

Purpose of the Research Study
We are asking you to take part in a pi[INVESTIGATOR_605579]. The purpose of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_605580] 
1) whether a structure of the Constraint-Induced Movement Therapy (CIMT) protocol is feasible, and 
2) its effect on motor function and use of the arm affected by [CONTACT_188712]. The new therapy is named 
Keys Treatment. This therapy includes all of the components in CIMT but is delivered over a 
distributed schedule in fewer hours each day. CIMT involves repeating intensive exercises with your 
impaired arm (the arm more-affected after stroke) and using your impaired arm for everyday 
activities.  In numerous studies of CIMT at UAB and in research studies around the world, it has been 
found that CIMT has helped improve motor function of the impaired arm of stroke patients. 
Study Participation & Procedures
Before participating in the research study, you will be examined by a team member who specializes in 
physical rehabilitation. They will determine if you are a good fit for the study. They will ask you 
questions about your medical history, take vital signs, and measure your ability to move your arms. 
The results of the evaluations can disqualify you from participating in the research if you do not meet 
the minimum requirements. If your arm function or health status changes after this evaluation, you 
may be dismissed from participating in the study. Therefore, you are encouraged not to change how 
you use your impaired arm between the screening evaluation and the start of treatment. If you 
qualify for and agree to join this study, you will be enrolled in the study. 
You will come in for initial screening, pre-treatment testing, periodic testing, and final testing.
Treatment will occur for up to 1.5 hours each session over 8 weeks with 4 days per week for 
Weeks 1,2,3, and 4; then treatment tapers to 2 days per week for Weeks 5 and 6, then 1 day 
per week for Weeks 7 and 8.  
On the last day of treatment, a face-to-face individual interview will be conducted. The 
interview will be audio recorded and transcribed verbatim afterwards. The interview 
questions will explore your perceptions and opi[INVESTIGATOR_605581].
The research team will administer one questionnaire once a week for 4 weeks over the phone 
or through an online link to an electronic form. 
If you are entered and complete the entire study, you will be in the study for approximately [ADDRESS_802014], and quality of life. You will also be asked to 
complete motor testing that measures the speed and quality of your arm movements. The 
questionnaires and motor testing will include: 
Page 3 of 8
FOR206 Version Date: 9/25/19 Motor Activity Log (MAL; measures how well and how much the impaired arm is used in your 
everyday life) 
 Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM; rating how well and how satisfied you are 
for tasks that are important to you) 
 Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT; arm motor skills) 
 Participant Opi[INVESTIGATOR_179267] (expectations about and satisfaction with treatment)
Stroke Impact Scale (SIS; quality of life)
 Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE; thinking skills) 
 Zung Depression Inventory (ZDS; mood)
Some of the questionnaires might be administered by [CONTACT_230861]. Some of the tests will be 
videotaped. 
Treatment will begin on your third visit to the laboratory.  Sessions will last up to 1.5 hours each day 
to complete the treatment procedures that will include: 
 arm training (personalized to focus on your needs) 
 arm training using everyday activities 
A portion of each session, 15 minutes on average, will be spent going over a set of techniques that 
help you carry over improvements from the laboratory to the home. In addition, at the beginning of 
treatment, you will be evaluated for any specialized equipment, such as a built-up spoon or spi[INVESTIGATOR_605582]. These aids may change as 
needed throughout the treatment. 
The therapy will also involve wearing a safety mitt about 90% of the time during the hours of the day 
that you are awake. The mitt is so that you do not use your stronger arm. You will remove the mitt 
before going to bed, and you will put it on in the morning. You will also be able to remove the mitt to 
carry out necessary bathroom functions and whenever it is not safe to keep it on. While your 
unimpaired arm is in the mitt, you are to make every effort to use your impaired arm as much as 
possible. 
You will be asked to do some homework when out of the treatment setting. You will be asked to: 
 sign an agreement to carry out the homework and other aspects of the training 
 do some homework assignments when out of the treatment setting 
 keep a daily home diary, and 
 talk to your therapi[INVESTIGATOR_605583], during the calls that will be conducted weekly for [ADDRESS_802015] you when you practice using your impaired arm. 
Risks and Discomforts
Page 4 of 8
FOR206 Version Date: 9/25/19While your less-affected arm is restrained you may feel anxious and frustrated. These feelings may be 
stressful. However, researchers will watch you closely to make sure you do not get hurt. There is a 
low risk that you may be cut or bruised while performing the training tasks. The therapi[INVESTIGATOR_605584], and the risk is low. You may 
also feel tired or fatigued during training for your impaired arm or may experience pain. The therapi[INVESTIGATOR_605585]. The only small chance of serious injury may occur if loss of balance 
occurs when wearing the safety mitt. The mitt leaves the less-affected arm free to swing to maintain 
balance while walking. If you did fall, it would be available for defense. In case of emergencies or in 
situations where you feel at risk of falling, you can remove the safety mitt -- but only under those 
circumstances. Otherwise, you are to keep the padded mitt on for the agreed-upon period. You may 
risk being recognized from the video recordings done for this study by [CONTACT_605592]. This is an unlikely event. Moreover, these individuals will be trained to 
respect the confidentiality of study participants. You may risk disclosure of the information collected 
for this study, if, for example, a hacker breaks into the computer systems where the study data are 
stored. This is an unlikely event because of the information collected for this study will be stored 
securely.
Benefits
You may not benefit directly from taking part in this study. However, this study may improve 
spontaneous use of your more-affected arm in the life setting, through using a safely performed 
motor intervention. Your participation may provide valuable information to the medical community 
about the treatment of stroke. 
Alternatives
Your alternative is to not participate in the study.

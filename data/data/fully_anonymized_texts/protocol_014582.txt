 1.0 Background  
 
With the production of high quality imaging systems and improved surgical instruments, video -assisted 
thorascopic surgery (VATS) has increased in popularity. When compared to an open technique VATS has 
been shown to decrease opi[INVESTIGATOR_4965], decrease length of stay and lead to decreased shoulder 
dysfunction.  VATS surgery has also been shown to decrease time until patients resume their normal 
activity. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_100368] , pain following VATS can be severe and long lasting. In addition to non -
steroidal anti -inflammatory drugs and systemic opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], paravertebral nerve blockade and epi[INVESTIGATOR_242609] -operative pain. Chronic pain after 
thoracotomy has been studied extensively, and VATS has also been associated with similar rates of 
chronic pain when compared with open techniques.  
Currently, there is no standard of care for post -operative pain control for these pa tients. The standard of 
care varies largely, depending on the anesthesiologist or the surgeon. Some anesthesiologists prefer 
thoracic epi[INVESTIGATOR_242610].  Each of these pain control techniques have 
been studied individually an d have been shown to provide benefits. Komatsu et al showed that 
adequate post -thoracotomy pain control was accomplished by [CONTACT_242637], while 
Yoshioka et al showed that epi[INVESTIGATOR_242611].  Our study aim 
is to compare three different methods of pain control that have been proven to show benefit in VATS 
and compare the efficacy versus the side effects of each techniques. We also aim to look at the effect of 
these different regional techniques  on pain [ADDRESS_294313] common techniques are:  
1) paravertebral block using anatomical or ultra -sound guidance  
2) visual placement of extrapleural paravertebral catheter by [CONTACT_242638]  
3) thoracic epi[INVESTIGATOR_242612]. Thoracic epi[INVESTIGATOR_242613]/vomiting. Paravertebral catheters have the advantage of having a lower 
side effect profile than thoracic epi[INVESTIGATOR_71543].  Paravertebral blocks have also been shown to improve 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_242614]. Single shot paravertebral blocks have been described as providing 
adequate post -VATS pain control, despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] a shorter duration of action compared to catheter.  In order to 
evaluate the effectiveness and the side effects of the different p ain modalities for post -VATS pain 
control, we will compare these three different methods of pain blocks:  
1)single shot paravertebral block  
2)paravertebral catheters  
3)thoracic epi[INVESTIGATOR_242615] [ADDRESS_294314], except for the single 
shot paravertebral block. The specific aim of the study is to compare the difference betw een the three 
pain blocks in achieving the following:  
1. Improved postoperative pain scores  
2. Decreased opi[INVESTIGATOR_4965]  
3. Improved patient satisfaction scores  
4. Decreased opi[INVESTIGATOR_27293] (Nausea, sedation, ileus, urinary retention, respi[INVESTIGATOR_2341])  
 
The primary endpoint of this study will be VAS pain score. The VAS scores will be taken with both rest 
and movement.   
The secondary endpoint includes intravenous opi[INVESTIGATOR_242616] (nausea, 
sedation, ileus, urinary retention, respi [INVESTIGATOR_2341]). The IV and PO opi[INVESTIGATOR_242617] 1, 24, 48, and [ADDRESS_294315] the integrity of the study data .  However, every attempt will be made to complete a follow up 
questionnaire.

 3.0  Enrollment/Randomization  
 
All VATS cases scheduled by [CONTACT_242639][INVESTIGATOR_242620]. The 
subjects will be contact[CONTACT_242640] -to-face prior to surgery. They will be informed about the study and all 
questions will be answered. The potential subjects will be given a copy of the informed consent form 
and authorization form. The subjects will then be contact[CONTACT_242640] -to-face in POCU on the day of surgery 
and if participation is agreed, written consent will be taken.  
A total of 120 subjects will be randomized by a computer program into three groups (40 per  group):  
1. US- Guided Paravertebral Catheter (PVB -A)- The Alaris pump will deliver 0.2% Ropi[INVESTIGATOR_228572] a 
rate of 10 ml/hr  
2. Single Shot Paravertebral Block - placed by [CONTACT_242641] 0.2% Ropi[INVESTIGATOR_242621].  
3. Thoracic Epi[INVESTIGATOR_13873] - The Alaris pump will deliver an epi[INVESTIGATOR_242622] 
0.125%bupiv/hydromophone  
Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_242642][INVESTIGATOR_186455] (opi[INVESTIGATOR_2583]ïve or opi[INVESTIGATOR_214652]). Separate 
randomization lists will be used for the two strata.

Ropi[INVESTIGATOR_242623].  
General anesthesia will be induced and the patient will be placed in the lateral position for the VATS 
procedure.  The patie nts will be intubated with dual lumen endotracheal tubes and placed on one -lung 
ventilation for the procedure.  
All patients will receive intravenous patient -controlled analgesia (PCA hydromorphone) post -operatively 
for breakthrough pain. Usual standard of  care for pain control following a VATS procedure include 
scheduling PO acetaminophen and PO oxycodone PRN on POD [ADDRESS_294317] and on movement (knee flexion) will be measured by [CONTACT_242643] (VAS). Nausea will be measured using a categorical scoring system (none=0; mild=1; 
moderate=2; severe=3). Sedation scores will also be assessed by a mem ber of the study team using a 
sedation scale (awake and alert=0; quietly awake=1; asleep but easily roused=2; deep sleep=3). All these 
parameters will be measured at 1, 24, 48 and 72 hours after the epi[INVESTIGATOR_242624]. Patients will be 
encouraged to ambulate on postoperative day 1 under supervision.  
All catheters will be removed by [CONTACT_229723] (Acute Pain Service) while patients are still in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. APS will 
continue to follow the patients until catheter removal. Patient’s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_242625] (National Surgical Quality Improvement Program) data.  
All patients will receive a phone call [ADDRESS_294318] -operative complication that is associated with the required medication per study 
protocol such as drug toxicity or nausea and vomiting related to taking the scheduled Tylenol and PRN 
(as needed) oxycodone for pain will be reported as an adverse event.  This required drug regimen is 
specific to the study.   All of these events wil l be reported to the  Principal investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_242626].  These adverse events will be assessed to determine if they meet prompt 
reporting criteria, and if so, we will report these events to the IRB committee using the prompt reportin g 
form.  Events not promptly reportable will be reported to the IRB at the time of study renewal, if 
applicable.”  
Normal post -operative adverse events such as nausea, vomiting, and pruritus will not be considered a  
recordable or  reportable event to the I RB since it’s part of the post -operative course expected with 
these procedures.  
 
6.0 Study Withdrawal/Discontinuation  
 
The patient can withdraw from the study at any time by [CONTACT_242644]. In such an event, the  catheter will be removed immediately, provided no 
anticoagulants had been administered. Patient may still have access to Alaris pump and will have access 
to all the IV and oral pain medications. Anesthesia acute pain team will continue to follow the patie nt 
for 24 hours. 24 hours after catheter removal, anesthesia acute pain team will sign off and all further 
pain management will be done by [CONTACT_96204].

7.0 Statistical Considerations  
 
Primary outcome: VAS score at 24 and 48 hours  
Primary Research Hypothe sis: Thoracic epi[INVESTIGATOR_242627].  
Secondary outcomes: Opi[INVESTIGATOR_242628] 1, 24, [ADDRESS_294319] bowel movement, incidence 
of urinary retention, and incidence of  respi[INVESTIGATOR_242629].  
Secondary Research Hypotheses: Thoracic epi[INVESTIGATOR_242630], improved patient satisfaction scores, and decreased nausea 
and seda tion scores compared to single shot paravertebral.  
Statistical analysis will be performed using a standard statistical program (SAS or SPSS). All data will be 
summarized (means, standard deviations, standard errors, and ranges for continuous variables; 
frequencies and percentages for categorical variables) by [CONTACT_19313]. Demographic data will be compared 
between the four groups using ANOVA or chi -square tests as appropriate. The primary outcome, VAS at 
24 and 48 hours, will be compared between the groups using repeated measures ANOVA; the model will 
include fixed effects for group, time, and the group by [CONTACT_242645]. Pain and satisfaction 
scores and opio id usage over time will be analyzed using repeated measures ANOVA. Nausea and 
sedation scores will be compared between groups at each time point using Mantel -Haenszel chi -square 
tests for ordered categorical data. Distributions of the continuous variables will be examined, and a 
transformation of the data (e.g. natural logarithm) or nonparametric tests will be used as necessary. A 
5% significance level will be used for all comparisons.  
Based on prior studies, the coefficient of variation for the VAS score at [ADDRESS_294320] a 60% decrease in VAS score 
between any two groups, assuming two -sided tests each conducted at a 5% significance level.  
 
8.0 Privacy/Confidentiality  Issues  
 
All study papers containing patient identifiers will be kept in each subjects confidential study file 
accessible to only the research team.  All records will be kept in a locked room in a locked cabinet that 
only authorized staff enters.  Collecte d data from each enrolled participant will be recorded on Redcap 
which is a secure web -based data collection tool.  At the end of the study, all electronic information and 
paperwork containing patient identifiers will be deleted or shredded.  
 
 
 
Page [ADDRESS_294321] opped and the data collected will be analyzed using statistical methods.  
At the end of the study, all study papers with patient identifiers will be shredded and only data without 
any patient identifiers will be retained by [CONTACT_242646].

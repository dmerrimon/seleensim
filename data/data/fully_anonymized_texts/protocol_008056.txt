Final  Version Dated 20 March 2013  9 1 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
1.1 Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension:  Definition of Clinical Problem  
Pulmonary arterial hypert ension (PAH), which is defined as an elevation in pulmonary arterial pressure 
and pulmonary vascular resistance, is a severe hemodynamic abnormality associated with a variety of 
diseases and syndromes.  Elevation in pulmonary arterial pressure causes an in crease in right ventricular 
afterload, impairing right ventricular function and ultimately leading to inactivity and death.   
 
There are three major factors thought to contribute to the increased pulmonary vascular resistance seen 
in this disease: vasocons triction, remodeling of the blood vessel wall, and thrombosis. There are a 
number of metabolic pathways implicated as contributing to these changes including vasoactive 
mediators such as the vasodilators nitric oxide and prostacyclin, the vasoconstrictor e ndothelin -1, and the 
phosphodiesterase type -[ADDRESS_575296] vascular remodeling and represent current pharmacologic targets.1  
 
Approved pharmacotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_451191]: (1)   intravenous prostacyclin (epoprostenol sodium or 
Flolan®)2,3, (2) the prostacyclin analogues, subcutaneous  (SC),   intravenous  (IV), and inhaled treprostinil 
sodium (Remodulin®; Tyvaso®)    and inhaled iloprost (Ventavis®), (3) the oral phosphodiesterase -5 
inhibi tors (PDE5 -I), tadalafil (Adcirca®) and sildenafil (Revatio®); and (4) the oral   endothelin receptor 
antagonist s (ERA)9, 10 , bosentan (Tracleer®) and ambrisentan (Letairis®, Volibris ®).11,12    
1.2 Treprostinil Background  
1.2.1  UT-15C SR  Nonclinical  
UT-15C is a novel salt form of Remodulin® (treprostinil) Injection and Tyvaso® (treprostinil) Inhalation 
Solution, which are approved in the [LOCATION_002] and other countries for the treatment of patients with 
PAH. The active pharmaceutical ingredient, treprost inil, exists as the sodium salt in the drug product of 
Remodulin and Tyvaso. Given that the only change to the drug substance synthesis route for UT -15C is 
the diethanolamine addition step, and treprostinil is not altered, the bioactive form of treprostini l 
diethanolamine and treprostinil sodium is predicted to be identical.  Therefore, in addition to the 
nonclinical studies conducted with UT -15C, an extensive amount of pharmacology, pharmacokinetic, and 
toxicology information on treprostinil sodium is avai lable from Remodulin and Tyvaso development.  
During the development of Remodulin, treprostinil sodium was administered SC and / or IV in acute 
toxicity studies, repeat -dose toxicity studies, reproductive toxicity studies, and genotoxicity studies, and 
has a well defined clinical safety profile.  Treprostinil sodium was administered via continuous infusion to 
both rats and dogs in toxicity studies for up to [ADDRESS_575297] included dose dependent, yet 
transient decrease s in mean body weight gain and food consumption in both rats and dogs and soft / 
mucoid stools, diarrhea, and vomitus in dogs.  Many of these findings have been seen previously during 
development of Remodulin and are consistent with prostacyclin induced ef fects.  In addition, post -mortem 
findings in rats administered UT -15C included changes in organ weight data and histological findings 
related to the adrenal gland, heart, spleen, thymus and bone marrow; some of which were not seen with 
Remodulin.  The majo rity of these findings were reversible following a 4 -week recovery period.  Data from 
a 9-month dog study provides additional toxicology information following chronic dosing.  UT -15C was 
reasonably well -tolerated following daily oral administration at dose  levels up to 35  mg/dog/day for [ADDRESS_575298] not been conducted; however, data are available for such 
studies using high doses  of Remodulin (treprostinil sodium).  Remodulin (treprostinil sodium) was non -
mutagenic in bacterial reverse mutation assays (Ames assay) at concentrations up to 5,000 mcg/plate 
with and without S9 metabolic activation, and in the mouse lymphoma assay at c oncentrations up to 400 
mcg/mL without S9 metabolic activation and up to 300 mcg/mL in the presence of S9.  
UT-15C was tested in vivo  in the rat micronucleus assay, which aimed to evaluate the potential of UT -15C 
to increase the incidence of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes in bone marrow of rats.  The 
results of the assay indicated that oral administration of UT -15C at total doses up to and including a dose 
of 50 mg treprostinil (equivalent to 63.4  mg UT -15C/kg) did not induce a significant increas e in the 
incidence of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes in either male or female SD rats.  Mortality 
observed at the high dose indicates systemic exposure of animals to the test article.  Based upon these 
findings, treprostinil diethanolamine (UT -15C) was concluded to be negative in the rat micronucleus 
assay.  
 
Segment I (rat) and Segment II (rat and rabbit) reproductive and developmental toxicology studies have 
also been conducted. No adverse effects for fetal viability / growth and fetal developme nt (teratogenicity) 
were seen in rats at or below 20 mg/kg/day or rabbits at or below 0.5 mg/kg/day.  At high doses, there 
were teratogenic effects of UT -15C observed when administered to rabbits.  Findings included increased 
fetal incidence of external, s oft tissue, and skeletal malformations.  Additionally, a Segment III 
reproductive and developmental toxicology study has been conducted in female rats.  F0 female rats 
receiving 10  mg/kg/day had decreased food consumption and body weights during gestation,  increased 
duration of gestation, had slight decreases in the viability and number of pups per litter, and pups with 
decreased mean neonatal body weights.  F1 pups of females that received 20  mg/kg/day had 
abnormalities in physical development (development al landmarks), reflex development, exploratory 
behavior, learning and memory, and sexual maturation.  
 
A six month carcinogenicity study in hemizygous Tg.rasH2 mice administered UT -15C at daily oral doses 
of 3, 7.5, 15 mg/kg and 5, 10, 20 mg/kg in females a nd males, respectively, for [ADDRESS_575299] been conducted by [CONTACT_308754] (NTP) to determine 
whether diethanola mine by [CONTACT_5071] (without treprostinil or any other drug) causes cancer.  Two years of 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_451192] (compared to a control 
group) of malignant liver tumors in males and females, as well as a n increased incidence of malignant 
kidney tumors in males.  Doses used in this study were approximately 720 to 2,900 times higher (based 
on mg/m2 dosing) than the proposed starting doses for the UT -15C clinical studies.  However, in 
transgenic mice and rat s, topi[INVESTIGATOR_451193], 
respectively, was not associated with the development of any cancers.  The relevance of the mouse 
tumor findings to humans is currently unknown.  Diethanolamine is listed on the FD A database of inactive 
ingredients for a number of approved drug products with no apparent safety concerns.  
 
A GLP cardiovascular safety pharmacology study (Study 1259DU16.003) to evaluate diethanolamine 
effects, independent of treprostinil, on cardiovascu lar function in telemetered dogs has been  conducted.  
Since there are 0.269 grams of diethanolamine per each gram of treprostinil in UT -15C, for this study, 
doses of diethanolamine were selected that were similar or higher than the amount of diethanolamine  
contained in the doses of UT -15C assessed in the UT -15C cardiovascular safety pharmacology study 
(Study 1259DU16.002).  Doses of 0, 2, 3 and 4 mg/kg/day of diethanolamine (equivalent to the amount of 
diethanolamine administered with 7, 11, and 15 mg/kg/da y of treprostinil, the free acid of UT -15C), were 
selected to be administered to each of one group of four telemetered male dogs.  Oral administration of 
diethanolamine at doses up to 2  mg/kg/dose twice daily (4 mg/kg/day) to male beagle dogs was not 
assoc iated with any definitive changes in arterial pressure, heart rate or electrocardiogram parameters.  
In addition, no abnormal clinical signs were noted in the animals dosed with the vehicle or with any of the 
doses of diethanolamine.  
Protocol Number TDE -PH-[ADDRESS_575300] received single 
administration, to patients receiving continuous infusion for greater than 10 ye ars. 
 
UT-15C has been administered to approximately 1,600 subjects in phase I -III clinical trials.  UT -15C 
doses of up to 3 mg twice daily (BID) have been administered to healthy volunteers and patients with 
PAH have received up to [ADDRESS_575301] 
individual exposure is now greater than  five years.  
 
The absolute bioavailability of the UT -15C 1 mg tablet is 17% compared with IV Remodulin.  Following 
administration, treprostinil diethanolamine is widely dist ributed.  Treprostinil is approximately 96% protein 
bound with no effect on warfarin or digoxin displacement.  Pharmacokinetic data (area under the curve; 
AUC) indicate that Day [ADDRESS_575302] of induction and inhibition of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C8 and CYP 2C9 
metabolic pathways on treprostinil diethanolamine indicate that CYP 2C8 appears to be of major 
importance and C YP 2C9 of minor importance to in vivo  metabolism of UT -15C in humans.  
A comprehensive description of UT -15C (treprostinil diethanolamine), including the pharmacology, 
toxicology, and clinical studies completed to date may be found in the most recent Invest igators’ 
Brochure.  
 
To date, the majority of UT -15C clinical  studies have been conducted with twice daily dosing.  In an 
attempt to understand the pharmacokinetics of three times daily dosing (TID) a study was conducted in 
healthy volunteers.  In this open -label, single -center study 19 healthy subjects received 0.5 mg TID for 7 
days.  On the morning of Day 1 subjects received a single 0.5 mg dose, on Days 2 -7 the subjects 
received TID dosing of 0.5 mg (approximately 8AM, 2PM, and 8PM)  administered immediate ly following a 
meal. On the morning of Day 8, the subjects received a final dose of 0.5 mg.  
 
Intensive 24 hour PK sampling occurred following the 8AM doses on Days 1, 7 and 8. Trough samples 
were collected prior to the morning (8 AM) and evening (8PM) dose s on Days 4, 5 and 6.   
Nineteen subjects (9F: 10M) with a mean age of 35.2 years (range: 20 -54) were enrolled.  On Day 1 the 
mean (+/ - SD) maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of treprostinil was 0.574 +/ - 0.22 ng/mL, occurring 
at a median time of 4 hours (range: 2 -6 hrs).  In comparison, the Day 8 mean (+/ - SD)  Cmax was 0.615 
+/- 0.32 ng/mL, occurring at a median time of 4 hours (range: 1 -6 hrs). [Figure 1]

Final  Version Dated 20 March 2013  13 1.2.3  Remodulin Experience  
Remodulin (treprostinil sodium) Injection is a sterile solution of treprostinil sodium formulated for 
subcutaneous or intravenous administration using an ambulatory infusion pump.  The toxicity profile of 
treprostinil delivered by [CONTACT_451203].  The studies 
conducted include the complete International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) battery of genetic 
toxicology studies; acute, single -dose, intravenous and oral toxicity studies in rats and mice ; acute, 
single -dose, subcutaneous toxicity studies in rats and dogs; repeat dose, continuous subcutaneous 
infusion toxicity studies up to 6 months in duration in rats and dogs; and reproductive toxicity studies in 
rats (fertility, teratology and pre/postn atal) and rabbits (teratology).  
 
 
The clinical development of subcutaneous Remodulin included two international, placebo -controlled, 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_36491] (13 countries, 40 centers).  These two studies were identical in design and together 
enrolled 470 patients with PAH.  Patients receiving Remodulin had clinically significant improvements in 
exercise tolerance (both distance walked and associated dyspnea), symptoms of PAH, physician -based 
dyspnea -fatigue rating, hemodynamic variables, and quality of life (physic al domain) compared to patients 
receiving placebo treatment.  Open -label efficacy data collected by [CONTACT_451204] -term treatment.  
 
The most frequent adverse events (AEs) assoc iated with Remodulin therapy were related to the 
pharmacological properties of Remodulin and were generally not serious.  These prostacyclin -related AEs 
fell into two categories: those related to the local prostaglandin action at the subcutaneous infusion site 
(e.g., infusion site pain and reaction), and those related to systemic effects that are characteristic of 
prostacyclin (e.g., diarrhea, headache, nausea).  Localized subcutaneous infusion site pain and reaction 
were common (85% of Remodulin -treated pa tients), but were generally manageable, typi[INVESTIGATOR_451194] a low percentage of patients (10 -15%), did not limit increases in dose, and 
tended to improve with time on therapy.  Remodulin was not associated with any significant changes in 
laboratory parameters or end -organ toxicity.  The safety profile noted in the open -label extension study, 
with much longer durations of exposure and a larger more diverse patient population, was consistent with 
the profile noted in the controlle d trials.  Thus, Remodulin was shown to be a safe and effective treatment 
option for patients with PAH.  
 
To date, well over 10,000 patients/subjects have been exposed to Remodulin from single administration 
to patients receiving continuous infusion of Remo dulin for greater than 10 years.  The Remodulin 
(treprostinil sodium) Injection approved product label should be reviewed for additional details on the 
results of studies undertaken during the development of Remodulin.  
 
Although Remodulin is an effective a gent given by [CONTACT_451205], these forms of 
administration have patient convenience limitations, including the need for an ambulatory infusion device 
and pain at the site of infusion associated with subcutaneous delivery.  Thus, an o rally available 
formulation of treprostinil would be of tremendous benefit.  However, the sodium salt of treprostinil (i.e., 
Remodulin) is not an appropriate candidate to develop as a solid -dose oral compound.  A more desirable 
salt of treprostinil (dietha nolamine) is therefore being investigated.  
1.3 Rationale for Development of Study Drug in Disease/Condition  
Prostacyclin (PGI 2) is a potent vasodilator and inhibitor of platelet aggregation that is produced by 
[CONTACT_451206].  A synthetic salt of pro stacyclin ( i.e.Flolan®) was developed and has demonstrated 
the clinical utility of prostacyclin in the treatment of pulmonary hypertension and other vascular diseases.  
Unfortunately, due to its very short half -life and chemical instability, Flolan must be  continuously infused 
by [CONTACT_308758].  Various analogues have been developed that have overcome some of these 
limitations, but the few orally active agents have remained limited by [CONTACT_451207] -life and poor 
solubility.  Remodulin (treprostin il sodium) is a chemically stable, longer acting analogue that has shown 
clinical effectiveness when administered by [CONTACT_451208]. Recent 
data indicate that a new salt form of treprostinil, diethanolamine, may be deliv ered by [CONTACT_149260].  It is 
expected that an oral formulation of treprostinil will not only allow patients suffering from PAH to benefit 
Protocol Number TDE -PH-[ADDRESS_575303], Remodulin, while reducing  the oc currence and/or severity of  prostacyclin -related  adverse events 
previously associated  with the twice daily regimen.   
 
The transition from BID to TID dosing should be made at the discretion of the investigator taking into 
account  the subjects current disea se state and tolerability of UT -15C.

[ADDRESS_575304] ’s visit schedule will allow assessments after defined perio ds of 
exposure to UT-15C SR  (3, 6, 12, 24 and 36 months total exposure).   The study will continue with yearly 
visits beyond [ADDRESS_575305] received UT-15C SR  (e.g., the date of study drug ini tiation in TDE -PH-
301, TDE-PH-302, or TDE -PH-[ADDRESS_575306] s who were randomized to placebo in the 
previous controlled trial ). Note that the TDE -PH-202, TDE-PH-203, TDE -PH-205 studies are open -label 
design and therefore will follow the regi men for subjects receiving UT -15C SR .  
 
Subjects enrolled from the TDE -PH-202 study  who were in Dose Groups 1 or 2 and permanently 
discontinued treatment may enter the study if they undergo all premature termination assessments prior 
to discontinuing study  drug and complete all remaining scheduled study visits and assessments (with the 
exception of the hemodynamic measurements) through Week 12. These subjects should follow the same 
procedures as subjects who received placebo in the previous study and will b egin on a dose of 0.25mg  
BID.

In this open -label study, there are no restrictions on concomitant medicati ons, with the exception of the 
addition of prostanoid therapy. If chronic  parenteral prostanoid therapy is added for the treatment of 
worsening PAH, the subject will be discontinued from the study. Short term, parenteral prostanoid therapy 
may be initiated  if required (e.g., the patient is  temporarily  unable to take oral medications). If prostanoid 
therapy is initiated for any other reason than worsening PAH, eligibility for continued participation in this 
study will need to be reviewed by [CONTACT_451210] a case by [CONTACT_413]. For subjects enrolling into 
TDE-PH-304 from the TDE -PH-203 study  continued chronic use of inhaled treprostinil (Tyvaso®) is

be taken by [CONTACT_451211]  (~ 10 minutes)  a meal while at the study site.  The subject 
should remain close to the study site for approximately 3 to 6 hours for periodic observation and 
monitoring of possible AEs.   
 
Subjects who wer e randomized to UT -15C SR , or were receiving active  therapy in the previous trial will 
begin open -label therapy at the same dose  and regimen  (e.g. BID or TID)  they were receiving at the final  
visit in the previous trial, and subsequent dose adjustments wil l be made based on symptoms of PAH and 
AEs.  
 
With Amendment 5, subjects may now receive UT -15C either twice (BID) or three (TID) time daily. The 
decision to transition subjects from BID to TID is up to the discretion of the principal investigator, and not 
a requirement of the protocol.  
 
The dose of UT -15C SR at the time the subject is discharged from each study visit should be recorded on 
the CRF.

6.1.4   Dosing of Study Medication in Relation to Meal s 
Subjects should take study drug approxim ately every 12 hours (+/ - 1 hour) for BID dosing and every 6 – 8 
hours for TID dosing , with approximately 240 mL (8 ounces) of water or other beverage (e.g. juice, milk, 
soda, etc.) immediately after (~ 10 minutes) consuming food (approximately 250 calorie s). 
Subjects should be instructed to be careful not to break, chew, or disrupt the integrity of the tablet as this 
will result in inappropriate delivery of the active ingredient.  If the tablet is inadvertently damaged during 
administration, the subject sh ould contact [CONTACT_451212].  
6.[ADDRESS_575333] and any returned medication ( as required for drug accountability purposes), and compare this 
accounting with the subject ’s dosing pattern to obtain an estimate of overall compliance.  Each subject 
will also be asked at each visit whether he or she is in compliance with dosing instruct ions.  If it is 
determined that a subject is not compliant with study drug then site personnel should re -educate the 
subject on proper dosing compliance.  Continued non -compliance may lead to discontinuation of the 
subject, after consultation between the Investigator and sponsor.

• The subject wishes to withdraw from further participation.  
• A serious or life -threatening AE occurs or the Investigator considers that it is necessary to 
discontinue study drug to protect the safety o f the subject.  
• The subject deviated from the protocol.  
• The subject’s behavior is likely to undermine the validity of his/her results.  
• The subject becomes pregnant  
If a subject is discontinued prematurely, the Investigator must provide an explanation in th e CRF 
(Investigator’s Comment Log) and complete the End of Study Record for that subject.  If study drug has 
been administered, the Investigator should make every effort to perform all scheduled evaluations prior to 
discharge.  In the event that a subject discontinues prematurely due to an AE, the subject will be followed 
until the Investigator d etermines the AE has resolved, the AE is  no longer considered clinically significant , 
the subject is lost  to follow -up, or for 30 days  following discontinuation of UT-15C. 
8.2 Study Discontinuation  
The study may be stopped at any time if, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_3755]/or sponsor, continuation of 
the study represents a serious medical risk to the subjects.  This may include, but is not limited to, the 
presenc e of serious, life -threatening, or fatal adverse events or adverse events that are unacceptable in 
nature, severity, or frequency.  The sponsor reserves the right to discontinue the study for any reason at 
any time.  In the event the sponsor discontinues th e study, an EXIT visit for each subject should be 
scheduled.  
8.3 Site Discontinuation  
The study may also be terminated at a given center if:  
• The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_308740]  
• The Sponsor elects to discontinue the study at the site  
• U.S. FDA, European, or national regulations are not observed  
• The protocol is violated  
• Changes in personnel or facilities adversely affect performance of the study  
Protocol Number TDE -PH-[ADDRESS_575341]’s health, as well as abnormal laboratory findin gs if deemed to have clinical 
significance.  AEs may also include worsening of an existing symptom or condition or post -treatment 
events that occur as a result of protocol -mandated procedures.  
9.1.2 Serious  Adverse Event  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is a n AE occurring at any dose that results in any of the following 
outcomes:  
• Death  
• A life -threatening AE  
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
o Planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602] (e.g., admission for elective surgery or right heart cathet erization) do 
not qualify as SAE’s  
• A persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect  
In addition, important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_451195], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may 
jeopardize the subject and require medical/surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed 
above.  Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive tr eatment in 
an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or 
the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.   
Life-threatening means that the subject was, in the view of the Investigator, at immediat e risk of death 
from the event as it occurred.  It does not mean that the event, had it occurred in a more severe form, 
might have caused death.  
9.1.3 Expected  Adverse Event  
Adverse events associated with progression of PAH:  
An expected event that is rela ted to the progression of a subject’s PAH is defined in Appendix D, Part A.  
All events that occur during the course of the study that are included on this list and felt to be related to 
progression of disease by [CONTACT_451214].  If the event is either serious or unusual with respect to intensity, 
frequency, or dur ation, OR there is a reasonable possibility that it may have been caused by [CONTACT_5349], it 
must  be recorded as an AE in the CRF.  
Adverse events known to be associated with treprostinil therapy:  
An expected AE for UT -15C is defined as any AE that is defined  in terms of nature, severity, or frequency 
in the current Investigators’ Brochure and in Appendix D, Part B.  When an adverse event may be 
attributed to the progression of pulmonary hypertension or UT -15C SR (e.g., listed in both Parts A and B) 
it must be  recorded as an AE in the CRF if the event is either serious or unusual with respect to intensity, 
frequency, or duration, OR there is a reasonable possibility that it may have been caused by [CONTACT_5349].  
Protocol Number TDE -PH-304 Amendment 5  Confidential  
United Therapeutics Corporation  
Final  Version Dated 20 March 2013  25 Expected events attributable to UT -15C (e.g., liste d in Part B only) must always be recorded as AEs in 
the CRF.  
If an event listed in Appendix D Part A or B occurs during the conduct of the trial, it will not give rise to 
submission of an expedited safety report despi[INVESTIGATOR_451196] y attributable to the 
study drug, unless the United Therapeutics Medical Monitor, responsible for assessing the case 
considers it to be unusual (e.g., more severe than expected) and therefore reportable.  The data 
regarding such events will always be recor ded in the clinical study database, regardless of reportability.  
9.[ADDRESS_575342]’s source documents and on 
the appropriate CRF page.  Information relating to the AE such as onset and cessation date and times, 
intensity, seriousness, relationship to study drug, and outcome will also be documented in the CRF (see  
Appendix C  for definitions).  Where possible, AEs should be recorded using standard medical 
terminology.  If several signs or symptoms are clearly related to a medically defined diagnosis or

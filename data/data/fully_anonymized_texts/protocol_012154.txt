 an astigmatic cohort of patients.
Study Hypotheses: Subjects will have better near visual acuity  and near visual 
performance with toric, as opposed to spherical, contact [CONTACT_35483]. As such, the 
following hypotheses will be tested:
H01: There is no statistically significant difference in near visual acuity or near 
vision performance between contact [CONTACT_353693]
Ha1: There is a statistically
 significant difference in visual acuity or vision 
performance between contact [CONTACT_353693]
2.[ADDRESS_440448] lenses as compared to 
monovision2, 3 and toric lenses4 as compared to spherical correction; especially in low 
lighting or low contrast conditions. Unfortunately standard in office high contrast, high 
luminance testing is often not helpful in demonstrating potential improvement in real-world 
tasks afforded by [CONTACT_353694].
Woods et al began exploring patients’ preferences conducting real-world tasks such as the 
ability to 
locate a web page, read a newspaper or use a computer.[ADDRESS_440449] acuity testing were small, patients reported significant subjective 
improvements in driving, watching a television, and using a desktop computer, among 
others.5 
Wolffsohn and colleagues recently developed iPad based applications that can quantify 
reading performance on digital devices while the user performs reading tasks (see also 
Appendix).6 The user’s face is analyzed in real-time by [CONTACT_353695]. Swipes, changes in magnification and the time 
to complete the task are also assessed. This group also developed a Near Activity Visual 
Questionnaire (NAVQ) to quantify subjective near visual function.[ADDRESS_440450] digital and patient reported outcomes

at a near reading distance will be evaluated with an iPad application (Optom Central) 
developed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. James Wolffsohn. This application can measure reading speed, near 
contract sensitivity and can provide information on how a subject interacts with the 
electronic device (e.g. blink rate, working distance from the device, scrolling and 
zooming on the page, etc.).  This application is designed for research purposed only and 
is not commercially available in the Apple App Store.

 questions about their age, 
sex, race and ethnicity.
History The subjects will be asked questions about their 
systemic and eye health and surgical history. The
 
subjects will be asked questions about how they use 
their current contact [CONTACT_13276], such as their current contact

there is the risk of mild discomfort due to light being shined on the eye or through the use

contact [CONTACT_353713], there are some risks associated with wearing contact 
[CONTACT_13276]. Ulcerative keratitis (infection of the clear front part of the eye), is the most severe 
risk and can lead to loss of vision. Ulcerative keratitis is estimated to happen to about 1-[ADDRESS_440479] clinical practice. The risk of ulcerative keratitis may be reduced by [CONTACT_353714]’s directions for lens care,  including

Page 1 of 9 Version 4.0Title of research study: Toric Contact [CONTACT_353723]: Kathryn Richdale OD PhD, Eric Ritchey OD PhD
Why 
am I being invited to take part in a research study?
You are being asked to participate in a research study to help us evaluate the vision and performance  of 
different types of contact [CONTACT_353724]. You may be eligible to be in the study 
because you have a certain amount of astigmatism (due to the curvature of the front of your eye).. 
We will be testing different types of soft contact [CONTACT_353725]. As such, you may get slightly different vision with each set of contact [CONTACT_13276]. At the end of the 
study, the study doctors will explain the differences in the contact [CONTACT_353726]. 
Taking part in this study is entirely voluntary, meaning that you may or may not choose to participate. 
To decide whether or not you want to be part
 of this research, the risks and possible benefits of the 
study are described in this form so you can make an informed decision. This process is known as 
informed consent. This consent form describes the purpose, procedures, possible benefits and risks of 
the study. This form also explains how your medical information will be used and who may see it. You 
may have a copy of this form to take home to review and ask advice from others. 
What should I know about a research study?
Someone will explain this research  study to you.
Whether or not you take part is up to you.
You can choose not to take part.
You can agree to take part and later change your mind.
Your decision will not be held against you.
You can ask all the questions you want before you decide, and can ask questions at any time 
during the study.
Why is 
this research being done?
The purpose of this research is to better understand how  different types of contact [CONTACT_353727], like the ability to read on digital devices. 
How long will the research last?
Each subject should complete the study in less than one month. The study requires [ADDRESS_440488] lens powers you will wear during the study. You will be randomized (like flippi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a coin) to

How many people will be studied? 
We expect to start
 about [ADDRESS_440502] 34 people to complete the  study.
What happens if I say yes, I want to be in this research?
All of the tests done during the study are described above. All of the contact [CONTACT_353733]. The eye examination and contact [CONTACT_353734]. The questionnaires and special vision and reading testing are done for research 
purposes to get a better idea of how subjects are performing with the contact [CONTACT_13276]. 
An iPad app will be used to measure your reading performance. This iPad App used the FaceTime 
camera to
 track your blinks and eye movements, as well as to make sure that you are properly lined up 
with the device, 
This research study will be conducted at The Ocular Surface Institute by [CONTACT_7355]. 
Optometrists (eye doctors) will fit the contact [CONTACT_353735]. A 
research assistant may help with the questionnaire and visual performance testing.
The contact

9/12/2018 - 3/28/[ADDRESS_440504] being in this study could be bad for me?
The risks to subjects from participation in the study are minimal. The procedures  in the study (slit lamp 
exam, contact [CONTACT_224044], etc.) are commonly used clinical procedures in optometry and 
ophthalmology. 
Commercially available (FDA approved) contact [CONTACT_353711]. While most 
individuals wear contact
 [CONTACT_353713], there are some risks associated with wearing contact 
[CONTACT_13276]. Ulcerative keratitis (infection of the clear front part of the eye), is the most severe risk and can 
lead to loss of vision. Ulcerative keratitis is estimated to happen to about 1-[ADDRESS_440505] lenses. The risk of ulcerative keratitis may be reduced by [CONTACT_353737]’s directions for lens care including throwing out your contact [CONTACT_353738], never sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_353690], and never exposing your contact [CONTACT_353716].
The following problems may also occur when wearing contact [CONTACT_13276]:
Other, less serious, infections or inflammation of the eye(s)
Burning, stinging, itching, dryness or general irritation of the eye(s)
Corneal neovascularization (small blood vessels growing into the cornea) 
Excessive watering, unusual eye  secretions (such as mucus), or redness of the eye(s)
Reduced or blurred vision (compared to glasses)
Seeing rainbows or halos around bright lights (compared to glasses)
In the event you experience signs or symptoms associated with one of the problems listed 
above, you should
 immediately contact [CONTACT_353739] [PHONE_7318] 
(during regular business hours) or the study Principal Investigator, [CONTACT_353746], at 
[PHONE_7319] or [CONTACT_353747] at [PHONE_7320] (outside business hours).
Will I get anything for being in this study?
If you are eligible for the study and complete all 5 study visits you will receive a $[ADDRESS_440506] ($40/visit for 5 visits). If you attend the
 first visit but are not eligible (screen fail), you will receive 
a $[ADDRESS_440507] for Visit 1. If you are exited from the study at a later visit (due to problems 
with the fit or vision of the contact [CONTACT_13276], or not attending the study visits as assigned), you will only 
be paid for the study visits that you completed on time. You will be paid when you complete or 
otherwise exit the study.

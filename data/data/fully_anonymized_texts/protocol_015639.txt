Site Numbers & 
Names: Protocol IM103-133, Emory University 
Research Hypothesis:  Belatacept will effectively inhibit sensitization (ie donor-
specific allo-antibody production) in patients  with a failing  or 
failed renal allograft and as a result will facilitate  re-
transplantation .  In addition treatment with belatacept will 
more favorably impact residual allograft function (ie preservation of GFR) in patients with IF/TA as compared to treatment with conventional immunosuppression thereby

efficacy and overall safety data regularly to ensure that the benefits and risks of study participation remain acceptable.  
During its regular reviews, the DMC will also assess the rate progression to dialysis, development of allo-antibody, and serious adverse events (SAEs), including serious infections and malignancies.  Bas ed on the regular reviews of emerging 
data, the DMC may recommend to the sponsor alt eration 
and/or termination of the trial or cessation of further enrollment into a treatment group. 
10 
Belatacept IM 103 -133 Version10.0 02Aug2020  Statistics:  There will be two main methods of analyzing the primary 
outcome at the end of the study.  One will be a chi -squared 
test comparing the proportion of patients who developed 
donor-specific antibody in each study group.  The second 
analysis will be a log -rank test comparing the survival curves 
(survival being defined as the time until development of donor 
specific antibody) between the two study groups.   A separate 
set of similar analyses will evaluate both the need and time to 
initiating dialysis.  Subjects requiring dialysis at the time of 
enrollment will be excluded  from this analysis.  In both 
calculations there are s imilar assumptions made; we will use a 
two-sided test with a significance level of 0.[ADDRESS_362309] statistic al methods include t he 
change in PRA, the level of allo- antibody intensity, GFR and 
change in GFR.

1.2 Summary of Results of Investigational Program  
Belatacept represents a new class of immunosuppressive therapy. As a soluble chimeric 
protein, belatacept was designed to selectively inhibit the co- stimulation of T -cells by 
[CONTACT_296875] -stimulatory signals required for T -cell activation. 
Belatacept was derived from the novel fusion protein CTLA4Ig (abatacept, 
BMS-188667) and differs from its parent molecule at 2 point mutations. Compris ed of a 
modified extracellular domain of human CTLA4 fused to a fragment of the Fc domain of 
a human immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 antibody, bel atacept contains [ADDRESS_362310]. 
Additionally, it has demonstrated a higher  avidity for the blockade of specific humoral 
responses.  
1.2.1  Pharmacology of Belatacept  
T-cell activation requires 2 signals: T-cell receptor antigen binding and a subsequent 
co-stimulatory signal. The first signal, which is antigen specific, is delivered by 
[CONTACT_296876] T-cell receptor with antigen presented in context wi th major 
histocompatibility complex molecules on the antigen presenting cell (APC). The second, 
or co-stimulatory signal, is delivered by [CONTACT_296877] a co- stimulatory ligand on the 
APC with a receptor on the T-cell. A key co -stimulatory signal is provided by [CONTACT_296878] B7- 1 (CD80) and B7- 2 (CD86) on APCs with CD28 expressed on T -cells. 
In the absence of this second signal, the T -cell becomes anergic (unresponsive) or 
undergoes apoptosis. Engagement of this second signal allows for full T -cell activation 
[ADDRESS_362311] ivated, 
CTLA4 (CD152) becomes expressed on the cell surface. CTLA4 has a substantially 
higher avidity (approximately 500- to 2,500- fold) than CD28 for CD80 and CD86. 
CD28/CTLA4 engagement blocks further activation of T -cells. The increased avidity of 
endogenous CTLA4, in comparison with CD28, affords a homeostatic mechanism to 
down-regulate T -cell activity. By [CONTACT_234932]80/86, the fusion protein 
CTLA4Ig  (abatacept)  blocks the interaction of the T -cell’s CD28 with the APC’s 
CD80/CD86, thus preventi ng T-cells from receiving the required second co- stimulatory 
signal. Belatacept has the same mechanism of action, but demonstrates a higher avidity 
for the CD86. 
Belatacept ’s parent molecule, CTLA4Ig  (abatacept),  has been shown to be effective in a 
wide variety of preclinical models and in subjects with psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis 
(RA). With respect to transplantation, CTLA4Ig (abatacept)  demonstrated efficacy in 
rodent models of transplantation, but did not demonstrate substantial efficacy in a 
non-human primate renal transplant model (cynomolgus monkey). Therefore, belatacept, 
a 2 amino acid variant of CTLA4Ig, was developed. This alteration resulted in markedly increased binding avidity for B7 molecules, in particular B7- 2 (CD86). Belatacept was 
subsequently shown to prevent allograft rejection in a non human primate renal transplant 
model in which CTLA4Ig was not effective (see Investigator Brochure for additional details). 
1.2.[ADDRESS_362312] udy, cynomolgus monkeys were treated with 0 (control), 9,  
30, or 90 mg/kg of belatacept.
1 No drug-related toxicity was observed in monkeys given 
belatacept at doses of up to 90 mg/kg. At doses of 9 and 30 mg/kg, antibodies to belatacept developed 5 and 6 w eeks after drug administration, respectively. In the 
presence of these antibodies, the rate of drug elimination from serum was increased.  
In repeat-dose toxicity studies
2,3 conducted in cynologus monkeys , IV belatacept was 
well tolerated at doses up to 50 mg/kg every other day for 1 month (15 doses), and once 
weekly for 6 months (26 doses). Major nonclinical findings were reversible, related to the pharmacology of the drug, and consisted of minimal decreases in serum IgG levels. 
Minimal to moderate lymphoid  depletion of germinal centers in the spleen and/or lymph 
nodes at all dose levels was noted. Functional activity of the immune system was demonstrated at all doses by a robust antibody response to the immunogenic KLH 
13 
Belatacept IM 103 -133 Version10.0 02Aug2020  following immunization after an 8 -week dose-free recovery -period. Immunogenicity 
when observed followed the treatment peri od. 
Although belatacept has demonstrated an increase in binding affinity in human and 
non-human primates for CD80 and CD86, the binding affinity for murine CD80 and 
CD86 is lower with belatacept as compared to abatacept.4 In studies evaluating the 
in vivo activity of belatacept in various species, belatacept was found to be either 
as active as, or less active than, abatacept in rodents and rabbits. Thus, belatacept’s 
increase in bioactivity seen in monkeys and humans do not directly translate to other 
species. As a result, the nonclinical safety assessment for belatacept was conducted in the cynomolgous monkey. To support this data, abatacept nonclinical safety assessments, 
including 6- month rodent toxicity, genetic toxicity, carcinogenicity, and reproductive 
toxicity studies were pro vided (see Investigator’s Brochure for further details).  
Currently, a complete battery of reproductive and developmental toxicity studies with belatacept is being conducted in rats and rabbits. Early results show that there were no 
effects of belatacept on reproductive function in either male or female rats, and no effect 
on early embryonic development at doses up to 200 mg/kg/day (human exposure m ultiple 
of 38-fold.

1.2.3  Other Toxicity Studies  
[IP_ADDRESS] Immunogenicity  
Belatacept, a human protein, is immunogenic in mice, rats, rabbits, and monkeys based 
on the ability of each species to induce belatacept -specific antibodies.1,2,3,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,[ADDRESS_362313] itself. Once 
belatacept specific antibodies were present, clearance of drug from the blood vascular compartment was often accelerated. However, exposure was maintained during the treatment period of each pi[INVESTIGATOR_45901] l study. The appearance of belatacept -specific antibodies 
was not associated with any acute or target -organ toxicity.

Belatacept IM 103 -133 Version10.0 02Aug2020  1.2.4 Human Pharmacokinetics of Belatacept  
In a Phase 1 study14 assessing the pharmacokinetic (PK) of escalating single IV doses of 
belatacept in healthy volunteers, the Cmax appeared to increase proportionally to dose, 
and AUC(INF) appeared to increase in a more than dose -proportional manner. The 
observed T -HALF ranged between 86- 222 hours at the dose levels tested. Following a 
single IV infusion of 1- 20 mg/kg, CLT values ranged from 0.45- 0.49 mL/h/kg. The VSS 
values were small, indicating that the drug (with high molecular weight) was confined 
mainly in the b lood and in the extracellular space. Both CLT and VSS appeared to be 
dose independent between the 1 and 20 mg/kg dose levels. The PK of belatacept appears 
to be linear following IV administration in healthy subjects at dose levels of 1 -20 mg/kg. 
The mean P K parameters in healthy patients are summarized in the table below.

Belatacept IM 103 -133 Version10.0 02Aug2020  In a Phase 1 study15 assessing the single subcutaneous doses of bel atacept in healthy 
volunteers, belatacept was dose dependent. From 50 to 100 mg, the Cmax increased 
slightly greater than the dose increment, whereas the AUC (INF) increased in a 
dose-related manner. From 100 to 150 mg, both Cmax and AUC incr eased in a 
proportion greater than the dose increment. 
The Cmax and AUC(0- 6h) values of belatacept following IV  infusion to renal transplant 
subjects were dose proportional  at 5 and 10 mg/kg. Accumulation index values <  1.5 
indicated minimal belatacept acc umulation after multiple dosing at the dosing intervals of 
2-8 weeks. The steady state was reached after approximately 3 doses for every 4- week 
dosing or after 1- 2 doses for every 8 -week dosing. The steady- state Cmin levels at 5 
mg/kg were 2-4 μg/mL for eve ry 4-week dosing and 0.2-0.4 μg/mL for every 8- week 
dosing. During the long term extension phase (LTE), belatacept exposure [area under the 
concentration -time curve in 1 dosing interval, AUC(TAU)] for subjects on the 4- week 
schedule was slig htly higher (1.3 -fold) than those [AUC(0- T)] on the 8- week schedule, 
indicating minimal accumulation upon 4- week multiple dosing. The mean steady- state 
VSS was 0.12 L/kg, indicating that this high molecular weight drug was confined mainly in the blood in t he extracellular space. Mean T -HALF of belatacept in renal transplant 
subjects was 197 hours (~8 days). Belatacept geometric mean steady- state Cmin for 
subjects on the 4- week schedule was 5.7 μg/mL. In contrast, geometric mean belatacept 
trough level for subjects on the 8-week schedule was 0.25 μg/mL. Overall, belatacept PK in renal transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_296839]. 
In a multiple -dose Phase 2 study,
16 the PK profile was evaluated in subjects with RA. 
Both Cmax and AUC(TAU) values appeared to increase in ratio comparable to the dose 
increment ratio after first and last dose administration. Accumulation of belatacept was found to be minimal in t he applied dosing schedule. The mean PK parameters are 
summarized in the table below.

1.2.5  Clinical Safety with Belatacept  
[IP_ADDRESS] Healthy Subjects  
No deaths or discontinuations due to AE’s were reported in healthy subjects treated with 
belatacept.14,15,17 Medical events including skin infection (n=1) and pharyngitis (n=1) 
was reported in subjects treated with 50 and 75 mg of belatacept, respectively. Common 
AEs included headache and nasopharyngitis. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Post Transplant 
Study IM103100 
In a Phase 2 Study (IM103100)  18 the safety of belatacept vs. cyclosporine (CsA) was 
assessed as part of a quadruple therapy with mycophenolate mofetil, corticosteroids, and 
basiliximab in de novo renal transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].  
17 
Belatacept IM 103 -133 Version10.0 02Aug2020  Subjects treated with belatacept were randomized to 2 dosing groups: more intensive 
(MI) and less intensive (LI). For the MI regimen, subjects were dosed at 10 mg/kg on

weeks starting on Day 197. For the LI  regimen, subjects were dosed at 10 mg/kg on Days 
1, 15, 29, 57, and 85. Staring on Day 113, these subjects received 5 mg/kg belatacept every 4 or 8 weeks. PK parameters, such as AUC(0- 6h), Cmax, and Cmin, were assessed, 
and the data are presented in Tables 5.2.5.1A, 5.2.5.1B, and 5.2.5.1C. 
Overall, almost all subjects in each treatment group  experienced at least 1 AE.

Study IM103100 Long T erm Extension  
Among the 164 patients who completed the 12- month phase, 128 patients continued in a 
long term extension (LTE) phase of the study; 102 and 26 patients were entered into the 
pooled (MI+LI) belatacept and CsA groups, respectively. As of 12- OCT-07, a LTE safety 
analysis determined that overall rates of AEs, SAEs and discontinuations were similar 
between belatacept and CsA treated subjects. The safety summary of patients entered in 
the LTE phase is summarized in Table 1.2.5.2D below.

The most commonly reported AEs ( ≥ 10% in each arm) reported among the pooled 
belatacept patients (MI + LI) in the LTE were psychiatric disorders (22%), cough (17%), 
pyrexia (16%), bronchitis (14%), reproductive system and breast disorders (22%), cough 
(17%), influenza (12%) and hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035] (11%).  
The most frequently reported SAEs ( ≥ 2/5% subjects) among pooled belatacept patients 
included neoplasms and malignancies (12%), infections and infestations (16%), and 
immune disorders (11%). The belatacept group reported congenital, familial and genetic disorders (4 subjects, 4%) more frequently than the CsA group. 
During the LTE phase (as of 12- OCT-2007), 9 subjects discontinued belatacept (MI or 
LI). The most frequently reported AE leading to discontinuation among belatacept treated 
subjects was transplant rejection in 2 subjects (2%). 
During the IM103100 LTE, 3 deaths (2 belatacept MI and 1 belatacept LI) were reported 
in the belatcept group. Of these, 2 deaths were considered unrelated to study drug (severe 
cardio-respi[INVESTIGATOR_296840]). One death attributed to P. carinii  
pneumonia, was considered possibly related to the study drug. 
Please refer to the most current Investigator’s Brochure for further details. 
Phase III Studies: IM103008 and IM103027 
Two phase III, randomized, controlled studies were performed to assess the efficacy and 
safety of Belatacept in de novo kidney transplant patients.  Study IM103008 (Study 1) 
[ADDRESS_362318] criteria donor kidneys and study 
IM103027 (Study 2) evaluated its performance in recipi[INVESTIGATOR_296841].  Belatacept was studied at the currently 
recommended dose and frequency in a total of 401 patients compared to a cyclosporine 
control regimen in a total of 405 patients. These two trials also included a total of 403 
patients treated with a belatacept  regimen of higher cumulative dose and more frequent 
dosing than currently recommended. All patients also received basiliximab  induction, 
mycophenolate mofetil, and corticosteroids. Patients were treated and followed for 3 
years. 
CNS PTLD, PML, and other CNS infections were more frequently observed in  
association with a belatacept  regimen of higher cumulative dose and more frequent  
dosing compared to the  current recommended regimen; therefore, administration of 
higher than the recommended doses and/or more frequent dosing of belatacept will not be 
used in this trial.  The average age of patients in these studies was 49 years, ranging from 
18 to 79 years.  Approximately 70% of patients were male; 67% were white, 11% were black, and 22% other races. About 25% of patients were from the [LOCATION_002] and 75% 
from other countries. 
The most commonly reported adverse reactions occurring in ≥20% of patients treated 
with the recommende d dose and frequency of belatacept were anemia, diarrhea, urinary  
tract infection, peripheral edema, constipation, hypertension, pyrexia, graft dysfunction, cough, nausea, vomiting, headache, hypokalemia, hyperkalemia, and leukopenia.  The 
proportion of patients who discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions was  13% for 
the recommended belatacept  regimen and 19% for the cyclosporine control arm through 
three years of treatment. The most common adverse reactions leading  to discontinuation 
in belatacept -treated patients were cytomegalovirus infection (1.5%)  and complications 
of transplanted kidney (1.5%).  Information on selected significant adverse react ions 
observed during clinical trials is summarized below.  
 
[ADDRESS_362319] -transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) up to [ADDRESS_362320] transplant were obtained for belatacept by [CONTACT_296880] (804 patients) with data from a third study in kidney 
transplantation (145 patients) which evaluated two belatacept dosage regimens similar, 
but slightly different, from those  of Studies 1 and 2 (see table below ). The total number 
of belatacept patients from these three studies (949) was compared to the pooled cyclosporine control groups from all three studies (476 patients). 
Among 401 patients in Studies 1 and 2 treated with the recommended regimen of  
belatacept  and the 71 patients in Study 3 treated with a very similar (but non- identical)  
belatacept  regimen, there were 5 cases of PTLD: 3 in EBV seropositive patients and 2 in 
EBV seronegative patients. Two of the 5 cases presented with CNS involvement.  Among 
the 477 patients in Studies 1, 2, and 3 treated with the belatacept  regimen of  higher 
cumulative dose and more frequent dosing than recommended, there were  8 cases of 
PTLD: [ADDRESS_362321] transplant in belatacept - 
or cyclosporine -treated patients presented within 18 months of transplantation.  Overall, 
the rate of PTLD in 949 patients tr eated with any of the belatacept regimens was  9-fold 
higher in those who were EBV seronegative or EBV serostatus unknown (8/139)  
compared to those who were EBV seropositive (5/810 patients). Therefore belatacept  is 
recommended for use only in patients who are EBV seropositive.

EBV Seropositive Subpopulation 
Other Malignancies  
Malignancies, excluding non- melanoma skin cancer and PTLD, were reported in Study 1 
and Study 2 in 3.5% (14/401) of patients treated with the recommended belatacept 
regimen and 3.7% (15/405) of patients treated with the cyclosporine control regimen.  
Non-melanoma skin cancer was reported in 1.5% (6/401) of patients treated with the 
recommended belatacept regimen and in 3.7% (15/405) of patients treated with 
cyclosporine. 
Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy  
Two fatal cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) have been  
reported among 1096 patients treated with a belatacept -containing regimen: one patient in 

26 
Belatacept IM 103 -133 Version10.0 02Aug2020  clinical trials of kidney trans plant (Studies 1, 2, and 3 described above) and  one patient in 
a trial of liver transplant (trial of 250 patients). No cases of PML were  reported in 
patients treated with th e recommended belatacept  regimen or the control  regimen in these 
trials. 
The kidney transplant recipi [INVESTIGATOR_296842], mycophenolate  
mofetil (MMF), and corticosteroids for [ADDRESS_362322] infections 
with identified etiology reported in patients treated with the belatacept recommended 
regimen or the cyclosporine control in Studies 1 and 2 are shown below . Fungal 
infections were reported in 18% of patients receiving belatacept compared to 22% 
receiving cyclosporine,  primarily due to skin and mucocutaneous  fungal infections. 
Tuberculosis and herpes infections were reported more frequently in patients receiving 
belatacept  than cyclosporine. Of the patients who developed tuberculosis through [ADDRESS_362323] infections with Identifies Etiology by [CONTACT_296881]

Infections Reported in the CNS  
Following three years of treatment in Studies 1 and 2, cryptococcal meningitis was 
reported in one patient out of 401 patients treated with the belatacept  recommended 
regimen (0.2%) and one patient out of the 405 treated with the cyclosporine control  
(0.2%).  Six patients out of the 403 w ho were treated with the belatacept  regimen of 
higher cumulative dose and more frequent dosing than recommended in Studies 1 and 2  
(1.5%) were reported to have developed CNS infections, including [ADDRESS_362324] Nile encephalitis, and one case of 
PML (discussed above). 

28 
Belatacept IM 103 -133 Version10.0 02Aug2020  Infusion Reactions  
There were no reports of anaphylaxis or drug hypersensitivity in pa tients treated with 
belatacept in Studies 1 and 2 through three years.  Infusion- related reactions within one 
hour of infusion were reported in 5% of patients treated with the recommended dose of 
belatacept, similar to the placebo rate. No serious events w ere reported through Year 3. 
The most frequent reactions were hypotension and hypertension. 
Proteinuria  
At month 1 after transplantation in Studies 1 and 2, the frequency of 2+ proteinuria on urine dipstick in patients treated with the belatacept recommend ed regimen was 33% 
(130/390) and 28% (107/384) in patients treated with the cyclosporine control regimen. The frequency of 2+ proteinuria was similar between the two treatment groups between 
one and three years after transplantation (<10% in both studies).  There were no 
differences in the occurrence of 3+ proteinuria (<4% in both studies) at any time point, and no patients experienced 4+ proteinuria. The clinical significance of this increase in 
early proteinuria is unknown. 
New-Onset Diabetes After Transp lantation 
The incidence of new -onset diabetes after transplantation (NODAT) was defined in 
Studies 1 and 2 as use of an antidiabetic agent for ≥30 days or ≥2 fasting plasma glucose values ≥126 mg/dL (7.0 mmol/L) post- transplantation. Of the patients treate d with the 
belatacept recommended regimen, 5% (14/304) developed NODAT by [CONTACT_296882] 10% (27/280) of patients on the cyclosporine control regimen. 
However, by [CONTACT_296883], the cumulative incidence of NODAT was 8% (24/304) in patients treated with the belatacept  recommended regimen and 10% (29/280) 
in patients treated  with the cyclosporine regimen. 
Hypertension  
Blood pressure and use of antihypertensive medications were reported in Studies 1 and 2. 
By [CONTACT_105652] 3, one or more antihypertensive medications were used in 85% of belatacept -
29 
Belatacept IM 103 -133 Version10.0 02Aug2020  treated patients and 92% of cyclosporine- treated patients. At one year after 
transplantation, systolic blood pressures were 8 mmHg lower and diastolic blood 
pressures were 3 mmHg lower in patients treated with the belatacept recommended 
regimen compared to the cyclosporine control regimen. At t hree years after 
transplantation, systolic blood pressures were 6 mmHg lower and diastolic blood pressures were 3 mmHg lower in belatacept -treated patients compared to cyclosporine -
treated patients. Hypertension was reported as an adverse reaction in 32% of belatacept -
treated patients and 37% of cyclosporine- treated patients.  
Dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_296843], HDL, LDL, and triglycerides were reported in Studies 1 and 2.  At one year after transplantation these values were 183 mg/dL, 50 mg/dL, 102 
mg/dL, and 151 mg/dL, respectively, in 401 patients treated with the belatacept 
recommended regimen and 196 mg/dL, 48 mg/dL, 108 mg/dL, and 195 mg/dL, 
respectively, in 405 patients treated with the cyclosporine control regimen. At three years 
after transplantation, the total cholesterol, HDL, LDL, and triglycerides were 176 mg/dL, 
49 mg/dL, 100 mg/dL, and 141 mg/dL, respectively, in belatacept -treated patients 
compared to 193 mg/dL, 48 mg/dL, 106 mg/dL, and 180 mg/dL in cyclosporine -treated 
patients.  The clinical significance of the lower mean triglyceride values in NULOJIX -
treated patients at one and three years is unknown. 
Other Adverse Reactions  
Adverse reactions that occurred at a frequency of ≥10% in patients treated with the 
belatacept recommended regimen or cyclosporine control regimen in Studies 1 and 2 
through three years are summarized by [CONTACT_296884].

Twelve subjects reported SAEs , and none was considered drug related by [CONTACT_291947]. Sixteen subjects reported SAEs, and only 1 was considered possibly drug 
related by [CONTACT_473] (elbow infection in an abatacept subject in the 2 mg/kg 
group). No deaths were reported during the treatment period or the follow -up period 
(through Day 169). All AEs and SAEs reported in belatacept -treated subjects that  were 
not also reported in the renal t ransplant patients are listed in the updated Investigator’s 
Brochure. Please refer to that d ocument for further details. 
1.2.[ADDRESS_362325] transplant  patients was assessed. 
The trial evaluated  the incidence of clinically -suspected and biopsy -proven acute 
rejection (CSBPAR) in patients at [ADDRESS_362326] -transplantation. Secondary variables 
including biopsy- proven acute rejections (BPARs), CSBPAR, death, and/or graft loss 
were assessed at 1 year.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Acute Rejection

The incidence rate of CSBPAR was slightly lower in the belatacept groups than in the 
CsA group. The distribution of events by [CONTACT_926] (as indicated by [CONTACT_240100]) was 
similar across the 3 treatment groups. Identical resu lts were observed at 12 months. The 
criteria for non -inferiority to CsA were easily satisfied for both belatacept groups; 
however, the number of events was too small to support any further conclusions 
regarding the relative efficacy of the [ADDRESS_362327] BPAR epi[INVESTIGATOR_240047] (ie, not associated with an increase in serum creatinine of ≥ 0.5 mg/dL). These epi[INVESTIGATOR_296844], according to local practice, or for other reasons than an increase in serum creatinine of ≥ 0.5 mg/dL. 
BPAR occurred most frequently in the belatacept LI group. As the rate of CSBPAR was 
comparable across treatment groups, the difference in the rate of BPAR was due to an increase in the number of subclinical rejection epi[INVESTIGATOR_296845]

[IP_ADDRESS] Renal Function  
Renal function was assessed by [CONTACT_296885]. Iohexol clearance was 
greater in the belatacept groups than in the CsA group at all time points. Serum creatinine 
and creatinine -based estimates of renal function were also assessed. These measures are 
known to be less sensitive and more variable than true measures of GFR. However, 
assessments of renal function by [CONTACT_296886].  
Mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) was slightly higher with CsA (133 mm Hg) than with 
belatacept by [CONTACT_43380] 12 (SBP: 130 and 129 mm Hg in the MI and LI groups, respectively). Antihypertensive medication use was also somewhat more common with CsA use than with bel atacept use.  
At Month 12, mean total cholesterol was slightly lower with both the belatacept MI and 
LI groups, respectively, than with CsA (198 and 201 mg/dL vs. 212 mg/dL), as were both 
the mean non- high density lipoprotein (non- HDL) fraction (145 and 144 mg/dL vs. 151 
mg/dL) and the mean HDL fraction (53 and 56 mg/dL vs. 59 mg/dL). Lipid-lowering medications were used more frequently with CsA (53%) than with belatacept 
(32%-36%). 
At Month 12, mean HbA1c was slightly lower with belatacept (5.8% in both groups) than 
with CsA (6.2%). The incidence of new -onset PTDM was slightly lower with belatacept 
than with CsA (2 and 0 subjects in the MI and LI groups, respectively vs. 3 subjects). 
[IP_ADDRESS] IM103100 Long Term Extension 
Of the 164 subjects  who completed the  12-month phase, 128 subjects (102/113 subjects 
from the MI + LI belatacept group and 26/51 subjects in the CsA group) consented to 
continue in the long term extension (LTE) phase of the study. 
During the LTE phase, a low rate of acute rejection, death, or  graft loss  was reported  in 
belatacept subjects. Two cases of acute rejection (CSBPAR) were reported in the 
belatacept group (1 each in the MI/8- week and LI/8 -week groups). Six cases of BPAR, 
including 2 cases of CSPAR , were reported in the combined belatacept group. All of 
these cases were mild or moderate in severity.  The incidence of CAN was reported in 25 
cases in the combined belatacept group and 9 cases in the CsA group. 
36 
Belatacept IM 103 -133 Version10.0 02Aug2020  In the LTE phase, mean calculated GFR (MDRD formula) was reportedly higher in the  
belatacept group. At Months 12 and 60, GFR was reported as 75.8 and 
77.2 mL/min/1.73  m2, respectively in the combined belatacept group and 74.4 and 
59.3 mL/min/1.73  m2, respectively, in the CsA group. 
Five deaths were reported: 3 in the combined belatacep t group (2 died with a functioning 
graft) and 2 in the CsA group (both died with a functioning graft). The causes of death 
reported among the belatacept subjects were myocardial infarction (LI), cardiopulmonary 
arrest (MI) and pneunomia (MI).  
1.3 Overall Risk/Benefit Assessment  
1.3.[ADDRESS_362329], CNIs are frequently not initiated until 
after there is sufficient clinical evidence of allograft function. This potential for delayed administration in a critical immunologic window may lead to increased acute rejection rates. Polyclonal antilymphocyte preparations may be used as an immunosuppressive bridge until a CNI may be safely administered; however, these preparations have 
short-term adverse effects (infection) as well as long -term sequelae (PTLD). These 
adverse effects must be factored into th e risk burden of a CNI- based regimen.  
Second, the adverse cardiovascular and metabolic effects of CNI -based regimens further 
weigh on the benefit -risk ratio of these agents. Since CNIs are well known to cause or 
exacerbate conditions such as hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, or diabetes mellitus, 
renal transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_296847]. Unfortunately, while alternative CNI -free regimens have been previously tested, none have been proven 
to offer a favorable benefit -risk relationship. Therefore, CNIs remain the cornerstone for 
immunosuppression in these subjects despi[INVESTIGATOR_296848]. 
An alternative strategy to promote improvement in kidney transplant function has been 
the use of mTOR inhibitors, s irolimus or everolimus, instead of  CNI or in combination 
[ADDRESS_362330] been hampered by [CONTACT_296887].  In addition to the detrimental effects of acute rejection, including a higher incidence of new donor specific antibody formation, patients required higher doses of mTOR inhibitor leading to an increased incidence of advers e events/side effects including hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], mouth 
ulcers, edema, anemia, proteinuria resulting in intolerability of the regimen and a high rate of discontinuation.  Belatacept, an immunosuppressive agent with a novel mechanism of action, is a promising non- nephrotoxic candidate for use in renal transplant 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. Unlike CNIs  or mTOR inhibitors , belatacept acts selectively rather than 
through ubiquitous pathways to afford immunosuppression. This targeted mechanistic approach may provide immunosuppres sive efficacy while circumventing the intrinsic 
toxicities of CNIs. Consistent with this notion, existing data show comparable rates of acute rejection, with favorable trends in subject and graft survival, GFR, CAN, and 
cardiovascular adverse effect profile.  
Two dose regimens of belatacept are being studied in Phase 3. Both regimens are based 
on the regimens successfully studied in Phase 2, with minor modifications to increase the likelihood of a favorable outcome. 
1.3.[ADDRESS_362331] -transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) up to [ADDRESS_362332] transplant were obtained for belatacept by [CONTACT_296880] (804 patients) with data from a third study in kidney 
transplantation (145 patients) which evaluated two belatacept dosage regimens similar, 
but slightly different, from those of Studies 1 and 2 (see table below). The total number 
of belatacept patients from these three studies (949) was compared to the pooled 
cyclosporine control groups from all three studies (476 patients). 
Among 401 patients in Studies 1 and 2 treated with the recommended regimen of 
belatacept and the 71 patients in Study 3 treated with a very similar (but non- identical) 
belatacept regimen, there were 5 cases of PTLD: 3 in EBV seropositive patients and 2 in 
38 
Belatacept IM 103 -133 Version10.0 02Aug2020  EBV seronegative patients. Two of the 5 cases presented with CNS involvement.  Among 
the 477 patients in Studies 1, 2, and 3 treated with the belatacept regimen of higher 
cumulative dose and more frequent dosing than recommended, there were 8 cases of 
PTLD: [ADDRESS_362333] transplant in belatacept- 
or cyclosporine -treated patients presented within 18 months of transplantation.  Overall, 
the rate of PTLD in 949 patients treated with any of the belatacept regimens was 9 -fold 
higher in those who were EBV seronegative or EBV serostatus unknown (8/139)  
compared to those who were EBV seropositive (5/810 patients). Therefore belatacept is recommended for use only in patients who are EBV seropositive. 
Malignancy 
Malignancies, excluding non- melanoma skin cancer and PTLD, were reported in Study 1 
and Study 2 in 3.5% (14/401) of patients treated with the recommended belatacept 
regimen and 3.7% (15/405) of patients treated with the cyclosporine control regimen.  
Non-melanoma skin cancer was reported in 1.5% (6/401) of patients treated with the 
recommended belat acept regimen and in 3.7% (15/405) of patients treated with 
cyclosporine. 
Infection  
Adverse reactions of infectious etiology were reported based on clinical assessment by 
[CONTACT_13922]. The causative organisms for these reactions are identified when provided by 
[CONTACT_099]. The overall number of infections, serious infections, and select infections with identified etiology reported in patients treated with the belatacept recommended 
regimen or the cyclosporine control in Studies 1 and 2 are shown above . Fungal 
39 
Belatacept IM 103 -133 Version10.0 02Aug2020  infections were reported in 18% of patients receiving belatacept compared to 22% 
receiving cyclosporine, primarily due to skin and mucocutaneous fungal infections. 
Tuberculosis and herpes infections were reported more frequently in patients receiving 
belatacept than cyclosporine. Of the patients who developed tuberculosis through [ADDRESS_362334] 
been consistently associated with belatacept treatment. These events are undergoing augmented surveillance in the clinical trials.  
1.3.3 Summary of Risk/Benefit Assessment  
Belatacept, an immunosuppressive agent with a novel mechanism of action, is a 
promising non- nephrotoxic candidate for use in renal transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. Clinical data 
from approximately [ADDRESS_362335] been observed more frequently in belatacept -
treated subjects. A thorough analysis indicates that the elevated risk of PTLD, an 
expected event in transplant patients, appears to be  restricted to EBV -negative recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], 
with no increase in risk in EBV- positive recipi[INVESTIGATOR_296849].  
Therefore, the current study offers a favorable benefit/risk relationship to study subjects, and the potential to provide important data for the development of new immunosuppressive regimens that have improved safety and tolerability when compared to existing therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. 
[ADDRESS_362336] histologic evidence of chronic injury 
with accompanying impaired renal function.  Many patients with failing allografts 
ultimately return to dialysis.  Fortunately, a significant proportion of these patients are re -
transplant candidates.   Indeed 10- 15% of all renal transplants are performed in recipi[INVESTIGATOR_296850].   There is an ongoing debate regarding the management of 
patients with a failed kidney transplant.  Those patients who require dialysis and are 
maintained on immunosuppression continue to be subjected to increased risks of 
infection, cardiovascular disease, malignancies, etc.  In fact several studies have shown a significantly increased risk of infection and death for those who continue immunosuppression after gra ft failure. Thus most centers favor tapering 
immunosuppressive therapy off once a patient requires dialysis.  Unfortunately, this puts 
the patient at risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_296851]- antibody which may limit options for re -transplant.  
The development of an immunosuppressive strategy to minimize the complications of persistent therapy while preventing sensitization could greatly enhance the likelihood of 
re-transplantation.

injury and over 60% have evidence of severe chronic allograft nephropathy, grade III 
interstitial fibrosis/tubular atrophy (IF/TA).   Many of these patients  ultimately return to 
dialysis. Given the increased risks of infection, cardiovascular disease and malignancy 
most patients have their immunosuppression discontinued when they start dialysis.  Unfortunately this puts the patient at increased risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_296851]- antibody which 
limits options for re -transplant.  Indeed a s ignificant proportion of these patients will be 
re-listed for a subsequent transplant.  Belatacept has a unique mechanism of action as an 
immunosuppressive agent.  Given its favorable side -effect profile, lack of nephrotoxicity 
and effectiveness in prevent ing T-cell dependent antibody production including allo-
antibody, belatacept represents an ideal agent to test in this patient population.

effectively inhibit sen sitization (ie donor -specific antibody production) in patients with a 
failing or failed renal allograft and as a result will facilitate re -transplantation.  In 
addition treatment with belatacept will more favorably impact residual allograft function

injury, thereby [CONTACT_296872]-transplantation by [CONTACT_296888]:  The rate of donor-specific antibody formation 36 months following 
randomization. 
2.2 Secondary Objectives  
To determine if treatment with belatacept better preserves GFR in those patients with 
marginal renal function as compared to those patients who continue calcineurin inhibitor 
therapy and as a result delays time to initiation of dialysis.  Subjects already requir ing 
dialysis at the time of enrollment will be excluded from this analysis.  
Secondary Endpoints:

based regimen. Subjects already requiring dialysis will be excluded from this endpoint 
analysis. 
-Time to dialysis measured from the time of randomization to initiation of dialysis  
compared to participants maintained on CNI- based or mTOR -based regimen.

serious adverse events (SAEs) in this study. In addition, other safe ty and efficacy 
variables (to be defined in the DMC charter) will be monitored by [CONTACT_296894].   
 The first review of data by [CONTACT_296895] [ADDRESS_362352] year and approximately every 6 months thereafter.    Based on regular reviews of the emerging data, the DMC may recommend alteration and/or termination of the trial or cessation of further enrollment.  Meeting structure, schedule, procedures, and communication between the Sponsor and the DMC, the content and format of DMC reports, and other relevant details will be determined in consultation with the DMC members and will be detailed in a separate charter.  
 
5 TREATMENTS 
5.1 Study Treatment : Belatacept  
An investigational product , also known as investigational  medicinal product  in some 
regions, is defined as  follows: A pharmaceutical form of an active substance or placebo 
being tested or used as a reference in a clinical study , including products a lready with a 
marketing  authorization but use d or assembled (formulated or packaged) in a way 
different from the authorized form, or used for an unauthorized indication, or when used 
to gain further in formation about the authorized form. In this protocol, the investigational 
product is Belatacept.  
Other medications used in the study as support or escape medication for  preventative, 
diagnostic, or therapeutic reasons as components of a given standard of care are 
considered noninvestigational products.

Belatacept IM 103 -133 Version10.0 02Aug2020  5.3 Method of Assigning Subjects to a Treatment  
Subjects will be randomized in equal numbers to the following treatment groups: 
1) CNI (tacrolimus or cyclosporine) or mTOR inhibitor (sirolimus or everolimus)  
based regimen (with or without MMF/MPA/azathioprine and/or steroids) 
2) Belatacept  based regimen (with or without MMF/MPA/azathioprine  and/or 
steroids) 
At the time of enrollment, immediately after written informed consent is obtained and 
before performing any study- related procedures, each subject will be assigned a unique 
sequential subject number for identification throughout the study.  This subject number will not be reu sed for any other participant during the study.  Once the subject has met all 
the entry criteria (inclusion and exclusion), the subject will be randomized to one of the two described treatment regimens.  Adverse event reporting for all subjects will begin at 
the time of randomization.   
5.[ADDRESS_362355] of care arm patients will 
remain on CNI  or mTOR inhibitor  therapy.  The tacrolimus  or sirolimus  dose will be 
weaned to achieve trough levels of 3-5 (if on equivalent medication , dose will be adjusted 
to achieve similar potency levels) .  If on MMF they will continue on MMF, equivalent of 
at least 1 gram daily , or if on MPA or azathioprine , a comparable dose.  If on steroids 
they will continue on corticosteroids. If on both MMF/MPA /azathioprine and steroids 
they will continue on both.  Upon initiation of dialysis  or in subjects already requiring 
dialysis at the time of enrollment, the CNI (tacrolimu s or cyclosporine ) or mTOR 
inhibitor ( sirolimus or everolimus)  will be discontinued over a 5 day period.  The MMF, 
MPA or azathioprine dose will be decreased by 50% and then discontinued 2 weeks later.  
Steroid dose will be weaned by 50% at one month after returning to dialysis, w ith a 
subsequent 50% reduction at 2 months and discontinuation at 3 months. 
In those patients randomized to receive belatacept, the CNI (tacrolimus or cyclosporine) 
or mTOR inhibitor ( sirolimus or everolimus)  will be weaned in the following fashion: 
dose of CNI or mTOR inhibitor will be reduced by 50% at time of first dose of 
belatacept. CNI or  mTOR inhibitor  will be discontinued at week 2 dose of belatacept. 
Subjects will receive Belatacept 10mg/kg IV on the first study day, at 2 weeks,1 month, 2 
51 
Belatacept IM 103 -133 Version10.0 02Aug2020  months, and 3 months.  Subsequent belatacept doses will be 5mg/kg IV every month 
through the duration of the trial or until re -transplantation occurs, whichever is first.  A 
month will be defined as one true calendar month.  There will be a ±2 days window for 
the 2nd (2 week) belatacept infusion, and a ±5 days window for subsequent infusions.  If 
on MMF subjects will continue their MMF (equivalent of at least 1g daily)  or if on MPA 
or azathioprine , a comparable dose.  If on steroids t hey will continue on corticoste roids. 
If on MMF/MPA/azathioprine  and steroids they will continue on both.  Upon initiation of 
dialysis or in subjects already requiring dialysis at the time of enrollment, the MMF or 
azathioprine dose will be decreased by 50% and then discontinued 2 weeks later.  Steroid 
dose will be weaned by 50% at one month after returning to dialysis, with a subsequent 
50% reduction at 2 months and discontinuation at 3 months. Belatacept will be continued 
at 5mg/kg IV monthly (± 5 days) for the duration of the study or  retransplantation 
whichever occurs first.  If a subject progresses to dialysis dependence while still 
receiving belatacept at the 10 mg/kg dosing, the subject will continue to receive 10 mg/kg 
dose as scheduled through month 3  (5 total doses) and then decrease to 5 mg/kg IV q 
month for the duration of study participation. 
Infusion doses will be based on the subject’s actual body weight  at enrollment , and will 
not be modified during the course of the study, unless there is a change of body weight 
greater than ±10%. Study drug should be administered to the subject at a relatively 
constant rate over approximately [ADDRESS_362356] of care re gimen.

will be checked prior to randomization.  If the EBV viral load is positive in an 
EBV seropositive individual, the subject will have the EBV viral load r epeated 
and the subject may be considered for enrollment when the result is undectable.   
If CMV titer is positive, the subject will be appropriately treated and reconsidered 
for enrollment once the viral load is undetectable for >1 month period. 
Obtain blood sample for donor specific antibody evaluation and overall allo-
antibody levels.  Donor specific antibody/anti -HLA antibody will be evaluated 
using the FlowPRA assay in the Emory University Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_296854]. The Emory Medical laboratory is a CLIA certified facility.  If allo-
antibody is detected then antigen specificity will be assessed using single -antigen 
HLA beads.  Results from donor HLA typi[INVESTIGATOR_296855]-HLA antibody is donor specific constituting a new DSA.   
Obtain a complete medical history and physical examination including a 
neurologic exam. 
Obtain body weight (clothes on, shoes off) and height, measure vital signs (BP, 
HR, temp, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]) 
 
[ADDRESS_362365]-Enrollment/Randomization  
Prior to the first treatment time point, confirm all inclusion/e xclusion criteria.  
Randomize when all entry criteria are satisfied.   Randomization may take place 
prior to the first post-screening visit if required due to scheduling constraints. 
Obtain vital signs, monitor for any adverse events, check and record any c hanges 
in medications immediately prior to first treatment session  
For subsequent study assessments see respective charts for either belatacept -
treated arm or standard of care group. If during the course of immunosuppressive withdrawal, the kidney allograf t 
becomes a source of symptoms (swelling, fever, local pain, and/or hematuria) or 
infection then trial participants will be treated according to standard of care as 
deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_296897], if appropriate, a limited 
course of oral or intravenous corticosteroids or if required allograft nephrectomy.  
Study participants will remain on their treatment protocol (i.e. continue to receive 
belatacept or wean quickly off the corticosteroid treatment back to no immunosuppression in the  standard of care arm).  For the purposes of statistical 
analyses participants will be treated in an intent to treat fashion.  
Study participants  will have the option to consent for storage of a banked blood 
sample for future mechanistic assays. If the subj ect consents to blood for storage, 
an additional [ADDRESS_362366] -initiation of dialysis period  as noted on the schedule of events.

The investigator will determine the severity of each adverse event as mild, moderate, 
severe, or very severe.  All adverse events will be documented.  In addition the 
investigator will determine the relat ionship of the adverse event to the administration of 
belatacept .   
All serious adverse events (SAEs) must be reported as described in Section  7.3.1. All 
nonserious adverse events must be collected as well and documented according to the procedures of the investigational site. They do not need to be sent to BMS. 
If the patient is a WOCBP, pregnancy tests (blood or urine; minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L 
of HCG) must be performed within [ADDRESS_362368] of care as directed by [CONTACT_093]. Laboratory specimens should be obtained before bela tacept infusions. 
Additional tests may be ordered if deemed necessary for monitoring the patient’s safety. 
PTLD Safety Surveillance  
Specific surveillance for PTLD will  be conducted for all subjects in this study. The PTLD 
safety surveillance should be impl emented as soon as IRB/IEC approvals and subject 
consent are obtained.

Belatacept IM 103 -133 Version10.0 02Aug2020  Any new or worsening findings should be reported as adverse events and evaluated with 
a follow up neurologic examination, additional modalities, and/or neurologic consultation 
as appropriate.  
EBV Titers 
Subjects receiving belatacept who are on dialysis will have samples sent for EBV viral 
titers periodically for the duration of the study.  Positive titers will be confirmed and 
subjects will exit the study and belatacept treatment will be discontinued if they have persistent positive titers .  Again only patients who are seropositive for EBV will be 
enrolled in the study. 
Subjects with Suspected PTLD  
CNS imaging and/or neurologic consultation should be considered for any subject with a 
new or worsening neurologic finding. For subjects who undergo biopsy for suspi[INVESTIGATOR_296856], the biopsy specimen will be evaluated for CD3, CD20, C D79 and EBER. 
Management of belatacept and other immunosuppressants in subjects with suspected PTLD should be discussed with the BMS Medical Monitor. BMS should be informed of all confirmed cases of PTLD.

7 ADVERSE EVEN T REPORTING  
7.1 Adverse Events  
An Adverse Event  (AE) is defined as any new untoward medical occurrence or 
worsening of a pre -existing medical condition in a patient or clinical investigation subject 
administered an investigational ( medicinal ) product and that does not necessarily have a 
causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or 
disease temporally associated with the use  of investigational product, whether or not 
considered related to the investigational product. 
7.1.1 Serious Adverse Event s 
A Serious Adverse Event  (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• results in death  
• is life-threatening (defined as an ev ent in which the subject was at risk of death at 
the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have 
caused death if it were more severe)  
• requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_312] (see note below for exceptions) 
• results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• is an important medical event, defined as a medical event that may not be 
immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_157691], based on 
appropriate medical and scientific judgment, may jeopardize the subject or may 
require inte rvention ( eg, medical, surgical ) to prevent one of the other serious 
 
66 
Belatacept IM 103 -133 Version10.0 02Aug2020  outcomes listed above. Examples of such events include but are not l imited to 
intensive treatment in an emergency department  or at home for allergic 
bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
All pregnancies, regardless of outcome, must be reported to BMS, including 
pregnancies that occur in the female partner of a male study subject . All 
pregnancies must be followed to outcome.  See Section  7.6 for instructions on reporting 
pregnancies.  
Although overdose and cancer are not always serious by [CONTACT_8661], these 
events should also be reported to BMS. 
NOTE: The following hospi[INVESTIGATOR_102412] : 
• a visit to the emergency room or other hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8610] 24 hours that does not result in admission (unless considered an “important 
medical event” or a life-threatening  event) 
• elective surgery planned before signing consent 
• admissions as per protocol for a planned medical/surgical procedure 
• routine health assessment requiring admission for baseline/trending of health 
status (eg, routine colonoscopy) 
• medical/surgical admission for purpose other tha n remedying ill health state that 
was planned before study entry. Appropriate documentation is required in these 
cases. 
• admission encountered for another life circumstance that carries  no bearing on 
health status and requires no medical/surgical intervention (eg, lack of housing, economic inadequacy, caregiver respi[INVESTIGATOR_040], family  circumstances, administrative) . 
7.1.[ADDRESS_362371]  
All adverse events, including those that are serious, will be graded by [CONTACT_296899]: 
• Mild (Grade 1) : awareness of event but easi ly tolerated  
 
67 
Belatacept IM 103 -133 Version10.0 02Aug2020  • Moderate (Grade 2) : discomfort enough to cause some interference with usual 
activity 
• Severe (Grade 3) : inability to carry out usual activity  
• Very Severe (Grade 4) : debilitating ; significantly incapacitates subject despi[INVESTIGATOR_296857] . 
The following categories and definitions of causal relationship to investigational product  
as determined by a physician should be used: 
• Related: There is a reasonable causal relationship to investigational product 
administration and the adverse event. 
• Not Related: There is not a reasonable causal relationship to investigational product 
administration and the adverse event.  
The expression “ reasonable causal relationship ” is meant to convey in general that there 
are facts (eg, evidence such as de- challenge/re- challenge) or other arguments to suggest a 
positive causal relationship.  
7.[ADDRESS_362372]. T o prevent reporting bias, subjects should not be 
questioned regarding the specific occurrence of one or more adverse events . 
If known, the diagnosis of the underlying illness or disorder should be recorded, rather 
than its individual symptoms. The following information shoul d be captured for all AEs: 
onset, duration, intensity, seriousness, relationship to investigational product , action 
taken, and treatment r equired. If treatment for the event  was administered, it should be 
recorded in the medical record. The investigator must suppl y BMS and the IRB/IEC with 
any additional information requested, notably for reported deaths of subjects. 
7.3.[ADDRESS_362373] be collected that relate to any later protocol -specified procedure 
(eg, a follow -up skin biopsy). The investigator should notify BMS of any SAE occurring 
 
[ADDRESS_362374] be r eported to 
BMS (by [CONTACT_1719]) within [ADDRESS_362375] be kept on file at the study sit e. 
All SAEs should be faxed or emailed to BMS at: 
Global Pharmacovigilance & Epi[INVESTIGATOR_34237]-Myers Squibb Company  
Fax Number: [PHONE_188] Email: [EMAIL_178]
  
For studies conducted under an Investigator IND , any event that is both serious and 
unexpected must be reported to the F ood and Drug Administration  (FDA) as soon as 
possible and no later than 7  days (for a death or life -threatening event) or 15 days (for 
all other SAEs) after the investigator’s or institution’s initial receipt of the 
information. BMS will be provided with a simultaneous copy of all adverse events filed 
with the FDA. SAEs should be reported on MedWatch Form 3500A, which can be 
accessed at:  http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/sc ripts/medwatch/. 
MedWatch SAE forms should be sent to the FDA at:

[ADDRESS_362377]  but is 
potentially related  to the conditions of the study  (such as withdrawal of previous therapy, 
or a complication of a study procedure), the potential relationship should be spe cified in 
the narrative sect ion of the SAE report. 
If an ongoing SAE changes in its intensity or relationsh ip to the investigational product, a 
follow-up SAE report should be sent immediately to BMS. As follow -up information 
becomes available it sh ould be sent immediately using the same procedu re used for 
transmitting the initial SAE report. All SAEs should be followed to resolution or 
stabilization.  
7.3.2 Handling  of Expedited Safety Reports  
In accordance with local regulations, BMS will notify investiga tors of all SAEs that are 
suspected ( related to the investigational product) and unexpected (ie, not previously 
described in the Investigator Brochure). In the European Union, an event meeting these 
criteria is termed a Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactio n (S[LOCATION_003]R). BMS will 
send investigators an  expedited safety report (ESR)  to notify them of such an event. 
Other important findings that BMS may report as ESR s include increased frequency of a 
clinically significant expected SAE, an SAE considered as sociated with study procedures 
that could modify the conduct of the study, lack of efficacy that poses significant hazard 
to study subjects, clinically significant safety findings from a nonclinical (eg, animal) 
study, important safety recommendations from  a study data monitoring committee, or the 
decision by [CONTACT_296900] a clinical study for safety reasons. 
Upon receiving an ESR from BMS, the investigator must review and retain the ESR with 
the Investigator Brochure. Where required by [CONTACT_296901] a central 
IRB/IEC for the study, BMS will submit the ESR to the appropriate IRB/IEC. The 
investigator and IRB/IEC will determine if the informed consent requires revision. The 
investigator should also comply with the IRB/IEC  procedures for reporting any other 
safety information. 
In addition, BMS will report suspected serious adverse reactions (whether expected or 
unexpected) to the relevant health authorities in all concerned countries according to local 
regulations (either a s expedited and/or in aggregate reports). 
 
[ADDRESS_362378] ion of nonserious adverse event  (NSAE) information will begin at 
randomization. This NSAE information will also be collected from the start of a placebo 
lead-in period or other observational period intended to establish a baseline status for the 
subjects. 
All identified NSAEs will be recorded and described in the medical record. If an ongoing 
NSAE worsens in its intensity , or if its relationship to the investigational pr oduct 
changes, a new NS AE entry for the event should be completed. N SAEs should be 
followed to resolution or stabilization, or reported as SAEs if they become serious. 
Follow-up is also required for NSAEs that cause interruption or discontinuation of 
investigationa l product, or those that are present at the end of study participation. 
Subjects with NS AEs at study completion should receive post -treatment follow -up as 
appropriate. 
7.[ADDRESS_362379] be documented appropriately, including the following: 
• any laboratory test result that is clinically significant or meets the definition of an 
SAE 
• any laboratory abnormality that required the patient to have belatacept discontinued 
or interrupted 
• any laboratory abnormality that required the patient to receive specific corrective 
therapy. 
When reporting laboratory abnormalities, the clinical term rather than the laboratory term 
should be used by [CONTACT_36713] (eg, document “anemia,” not “low hemoglobin value”). 
7.[ADDRESS_362380] use an effective method of birth control during the course 
of the study, in such a manner that the risk of failure  is minimized . (See Section  4.2.1 for 
the definition of WOCBP .) Before study enrollment, WOCBP must be advised of the 
importance of avoiding pregnancy during study participation and of the potential risk 
factors for an unintentional pregnancy. 
7.6.[ADDRESS_362381] be 25 IU/L or equivalent 
units of HCG. If the pregnancy test is positive, the subject must not receive Belatacept  
and must not continue in the study. 
In addition, all WOCBP must be instructed to contact [CONTACT_1755]/or other study 
personnel immediately if they suspect they might be pregnant (eg, missed or late 
menstrual period) at any time during study participation. 
7.6.[ADDRESS_362382] will 
be permanently discontinued in an appropriate manner (eg, dose tapering if necessary for 
subject safety). The investiga tor must immediately notify BMS of this event and record 
the pregnancy on the Pregnancy Surveillance  Form (not on an SAE form) . Initial 
information on a pregnancy must be reported immediately to B MS, and information on 
the outcome provided once it is available . Completed Pregnancy Surveillance Forms 
must be forwarded  to BMS according to SAE reporting procedures. 
Note: Any pregnancy that occurs in a female partner of a male study subject must be 
reported. 
Protocol-required procedures for study discontinuation and follow -up must be performed 
for the subject unless contraindicated by [CONTACT_8663] (eg, x -ray studies). Other appropriate

duration of the trial to assess patient survival, dialysis status, and serious adverse event 
occurrences.  
7.8               Influ enza Guidelines  
Per current CDC  influenza recommendations for persons with immunosuppression, 
including those caused by [CONTACT_6589], subjects should be counseled to obtain influenza 
vaccination in accordance with CDC guidelines (http://www.cdc.gov/flu/professionals/vaccination/index.htm ).  
In addition, they will be advised to promptly contact a healthcare provider upon onset of any fevers or flu like symptoms in order to  determine w hether early or empi[INVESTIGATOR_296859] (http://www.cdc.gov/flu/professionals/antivirals/summary -clinicians.htm).

growing population of patients. 
 
73 
Belatacept IM 103 -133 Version10.0 02Aug2020  The sample size for each arm will be 3 6 patients (Phase I 18 patients in each arm, Phase 
II 18 patients in each arm, total for each phase 36 patients).  From previous work it is 
assumed that the control arm will have about 60% of patients developi[INVESTIGATOR_296860] a 3 year period. (unpublished results, analysis of patients at Emory Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307])  It is 
proposed that the group treated with belatacept will have a dramatic decrease in allo -
antibody production.  Assuming a rate of 20% in the treatment group, the power would 
be calculated at 90%.   
8.2 Endpoint Definitions  
Primary Endpoint:  The rate of donor-specific antibody formation 36 months following 
randomization. 
Secondary Endpoints:   
-Rate of change in GFR  
-Time to dialysis measured fr om the time of randomization to initiation of dialysis   
- Overall level of alloantibody as indicated by [CONTACT_29663].   
- Incidence of infectious complications.

summarized beginning at the time of randomization.  Laboratory abnormalities will be 
descriptively summarized.  
 
[ADDRESS_362386] with a significance level of  0.05.   
The sample size for each arm will be 3 6 patients.  This sample size calculation is based 
on several assumptions.  We assume that the incidence of developi[INVESTIGATOR_296861] -specific 
antibody among the control group is 60% and among the belatacept -treated gr oup it is 
20% or less.  We also assume an alpha level of 0.05 and corresponding Z -alpha = 1.96 
and a one -to-one ration of exposed to unexposed subjects.  Calculations with these 
estimates yield a power of 90% to detect a three -fold difference in risk of de velopi[INVESTIGATOR_296862]-treated group.   
In addition to the aforementioned assumptions, additional assumptions required for the 
log-rank test include no loss to follow -up in 36 months and that the distribution of the 
incidence of the primary endpoint follows an exponential distribution.  Assuming an 
incidence of development of anti -donor antibody in the control group is 60% at [ADDRESS_362387] rate can be calculated as 0.[ZIP_CODE].  In the treatment arm, if  the 
incidence of the primary endpoint is 30% then the hazard ratio becomes 0.0099 and if the 
incidence is 20% then the hazard rate is 0.[ZIP_CODE]. 
Analysis of secondary endpoints will be performed at the end of the study period. 
Differences in the mean level of allo-antibody (ie PRA)  by [CONTACT_296902] -treated 
groups will be compared using a t -test statistic. The rate of decline of GFR among the 
belatacept group will be compared to the rate of decline of the control group using a Rate Ratio and corresponding 95% Confidence Intervals using the Mantel -Haenszel chi -square 
test statistic for significance. The time from randomization to initiation of dialysis will be 
compared between groups using Kaplan- Meier analysis and the log -rank test for 
significance.  The small subset of subjects already requiring dialysis at the time of 
enrollment will be excluded from this analysis. The incidence of overall infectious

Documentation of approval , signed by [CONTACT_1201]/IEC chairperson or designee , will be sent 
to the BMS protocol manager.  
All protocol amendments and revisions to the informed consent will be submitted to the 
BMS protocol manager  and to the IRB/IEC . No protocol amendments will be 
implemented until written approval has been given by [CONTACT_1201]/IEC, except when 
necessary to el iminate an immediate hazard to study subjects. Administrative letters 
should also be sent to the BMS protocol manager  and IRB/IEC; however, they do not 
require approval .  
If a protocol amendment mandates a revision to the informed consent, the revised cons ent 
must be used to obtain consent from subjects currently enrolled in the study if it affects 
them (eg, if it contains new information regarding safety), and the revised consent must 
be used to obtain consent from new subjects before enrollment.

Appendix 1 :  DSMB Charter  
 
Belatacept Therapy for the Fa iling Renal Allograft (Protocol IM103-133) 
 [CONTACT_296906] R. Badell , M.D., Principal Investigator  
[INVESTIGATOR_296864] (DSMB) will act in an advisory capacity to monitor patient safety and evaluate the efficacy of the intervention. [CONTACT_296906] R. Badell, Emory University, Atlanta, GA is conducting a clinical trial entitled, Belatacept Therapy for the Failing Renal Allograft (Protocol IM103-133).  
At periodic intervals as described in the study protocol, the DSMB responsibili ties are to:  
• review the research protocol, informed consent documents and plans for data 
safety and monitoring;  
• evaluate the progress of the trial, including periodic assessments of data quality 
and timeliness, participant recruitment, accrual and retent ion, participant risk 
versus benefit, performance of the trial site, and other factors that can affect study 
outcome;  
• consider factors external to the study when relevant information becomes available, such as scientific or therapeutic developments that may have an impact on the safety of the participants or the ethics of the trial;  
• review clinical center performance, make recommendations and assist in the resolution of problems reported by [CONTACT_978];  
• protect the safety of the study participants;  
• report on the safety and progress of the trial;  
• make recommendations to the the PI, and, if required, to the FDA concerning continuation, termination or other modifications of the trial based on the observed beneficial or adverse effects of the treatment under stu dy;  
• if appropriate, conduct interim analysis of efficacy;  
• ensure the confidentiality of the trial data and the results of monitoring  
  
 
 
[ADDRESS_362395] with the trial. The DSMB includes experts in or representatives of the fields of:  
• Transplant Surgery,  
• Transplant Nephrology 
• General nephrology  
• Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine 
[CONTACT_296907],  University of Virginia has been selected to serve as the chairperson. He is responsible for overseeing the meetings, developi[INVESTIGATOR_296865]. The chair is the contact [CONTACT_100092].  
 
Board Process  
The first review of data by [CONTACT_296895] [ADDRESS_362396] year and approximately every 6 months thereafter. 
Meetings will be conducted via teleconference and scheduled/coordinated by [CONTACT_219503]. Meetings will be attended by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_296866]/her staff. An emergency meeting of the DSMB may be called at any time at the request of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_296867].  
REPORTS  
Interim Reports. Interim reports will be prepared by [CONTACT_296904] [ADDRESS_362397] the approved minutes to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_874] 6 weeks of each meetin g.  
Each report should conclude with a recommendation to continue or to terminate the study. This recommendation should be made by [CONTACT_7558]. A termination recommendation may be made by [CONTACT_93534]. The Chair should tra nsmit such a recommendation to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_296868], by [CONTACT_296905]. In the event of a split vote in favor of continuation, a minority report should be contained within the regular DSMB report. The report should not include unblinded data, discussion of the unblinded data, etc.  
Mailings to the DSMB: On a scheduled basis (as agreed upon by [CONTACT_4318]) blinded 
safety data should be communicated to all DSMB members. Any concerns noted should be brought to the attention of the Chair who will take appropriate action.  
Access to Interim Data: Access to the accumulating endpoint data should be limited to as 
small a group as possible. Limiting the access to interim data to the DSMB members relieves the investigator of the burden of deciding whether it is ethical to continue to randomize patients and helps protect the study from bias in patient entry and/or evaluation.  
 
CONFIDENTIALITY  
All materials, discussions and proceedings of the DSMB are completely confidential. 
Members and other participants in DSMB meetings are expected to maintain confidentiality.

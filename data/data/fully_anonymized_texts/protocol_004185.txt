Primary and Secondary Objectives and Endpoints  
Primary and secondary objectives and endpoints are presented in the table below. 
Objectives Endpoints  
The primary objective of the 
study is to demonstrate the efficacy of fremanezumab 
administered as monthly and 
quarterly subcutaneous (sc) injections to adult patients with 
migraine with inadequate  
response to 2 to 4 classes of prior 
preventive treatments as compared with placebo The primary efficacy endpoint is the mean  change from baseline 
(28-day run-in period) in the monthly average number of migraine days during the 12- week period after the 1
st dose of fremanezumab  
The secondary objective  of the 
study is to further evaluate the 
efficacy of fremanezumab 
administered as monthly and quarterly sc injections to adult 
patients with migraine with 
inadequate response to 2 to 4 classes of prior preventi ve 
treatments as compared with placebo The secondary endpoints are as follows: 
• proportion of patients reaching at least 50% reduction in the monthly average number of migraine days during the 12- week period after the 1

The exploratory endpoints for both the double-blind and open- label periods are as follows:  
• to evaluate the immunogenicity response of fremanezumab and the impact of ADAs on clinical outcomes in patients exposed to sc fremanezumab.   
• to explore the relationship between genetic polymorphisms (including those within the calcitonin gene -related peptide (CGRP) receptor -ligand complex, in migraine-
associated susceptibility genes, and in as -yet undiscovered loci) versus migraine 
onset/severity, adverse events to medication and fremanezumab efficacy 
• to explore the relationship between  exploratory biofluid biomarkers versus fremanezumab concentrations, adverse events and fremanezumab efficacy  
General Study Design:  
This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, study with 
an open- label period to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of monthly and quarterly sc 
fremanezumab compared with placebo in patients with CM and EM with inadequate response to 
prior preventive treatments.  
 Placebo -Controlled Study– Migraine  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment [ADDRESS_162336] of a screening visit, a run -in period (28 days), a 12-week double-blind, 
placebo -controlled treatment period, a 12- week open -label period, and a follow-up visit 
6.[ADDRESS_162337] dose of fremanezumab for ADA blood sample collection. 
At the end of the open- label treatment period ([ADDRESS_162338] dose) a n end of treatment 
study visit (visit 8) will be scheduled and patients should return to the care of their treating 
physicians. Patients should be treated with standard of care after withdrawal from or termination of the 24-week treatment period/study, as appropriate. 
Double -blind period  
At the baseline visit (visit 2) , patients will be randomly assigned to a treatment group with 
fremanezumab (2 different dose regimens) or placebo in a 1:1:1 ratio as follows: 
• For patients with CM: 
− sc administration of 675 mg of fremanezumab at visit 2 followed by [CONTACT_142898] 225 mg of fremanezumab for 2 months or 
− sc administration of 675 mg of fremanezumab at visit 2 followed by [CONTACT_142899] 2 months or 
− 3 monthly doses of matching placebo 
• For patients with EM:  
− sc administration of fremanezumab at [ADDRESS_162339] dose followed by [CONTACT_142900] 225 mg of fremanezumab for 2 months or 
− sc administration of fremanezumab at [ADDRESS_162340] dose followed by [CONTACT_142901] 2 months or 
− 3 monthly doses of matching placebo 
Open -label period  
After visit 4, all patients completing the double -blind period will enter the open-label period. All 
patients (C M and EM) will receive sc 225 mg of fremanezumab monthly for 3 months.  (visits  5, 
6, and 7). 
Randomization and treatment assignment for the double-blind period will be performed using 
electronic interactive response technology (IRT). The study will be str atified based on CM or 
EM, gender, country, and a special treatment failure group defined as patients who must have 
had inadequate response to valproic acid. In addition, patients in the special treatment failure 
group must have had inadequate response to 2 to 3 other classes  of migraine preventive 
medications as defined in  Appendix H . The proportion of CM and EM patients in the study 
should be approximately 50:50 in each subgroup.  
The open-label period will not be randomized as all patients will receive the same monthly dose 
(225 mg fremanezumab).

− ICHD -3 criteria B and C fo r 1.2 Migraine with aura 
− Probable migraine (a migraine subtype where only 1 migraine criterion is missing)  
− The patient used a triptan or ergot derivative to treat an established headache 
Blinded treatment will be administered sc once a month (approximately  every 28 days) for a total 
of 3 doses (visits 2,3, and 4) and open- label treatment will administered for a total of 3  doses. 
(visits 5, 6, and 7). Final study assessments will be performed at visit 8 (end -of-treatment [EOT] 
visit), approximately [ADDRESS_162341] dose of fremanezumab. A follow-up 
visit will be scheduled 6.0 months (> 5 half- lives) after the last study drug administration for 
ADA blood sampling. Patients who discontinue early will have the follow-up visit 6.[ADDRESS_162342] patient (follow -up visit, visit 9). However, 
an interim database lock will occur following the end of the double-blind treatment period of the 
last patient for analysis of that portion of the study data. Final database lock will occur following the end of the open- label period.

The study will consist of a screening vis it, a run-in period (28 days), a 12-week double-blind 
treatment period and a 12- week open -label treatment period, which includes a last study visit [ADDRESS_162344] dose for 
ADA blood sample collection. The total duration of patient participation in the study is planned 
to be 50 weeks.  
During the double-blind period, patients will be randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive 1 of 
2 fremanezumab dose regimes or placebo as follows:  
• For patients with CM: 
− sc administration of 675 mg of fremanezumab at visit 2 followed by [CONTACT_142898] 225 mg of fremanezumab for 2 months or 
− sc administration of 675 mg of fremanezumab at visit 2 followed by [CONTACT_142902] 2 months or  
− 3 monthly doses of matching placebo 
• For patients with EM:  
− sc administration of fremanezumab at [ADDRESS_162345] dose followed by [CONTACT_142900] 225 mg of fremanezumab for 2 months or 
− sc administration of fremanezumab at [ADDRESS_162346] dose followed by [CONTACT_142903] 2 months or 
− 3 monthly doses of matching placebo 
During the open- label period, all patients  (CM and EM) will receive 3 monthly sc 
administrations of fremanezumab at 225 mg. 
Efficacy will be evaluated using information entered daily by [CONTACT_142904] t hroughout the treatment period and administration of questionnaires to evaluate 
headache- related disability, change in quality of life, health status, and satisfaction with 
treatment.  
Safety of fremanezumab will be evaluated through adverse event and conco mitant medication

hypersensitivity, and administration of the eC- SSRS . In addition, blood will be collected for 
pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity, biomarker, and pharmacogenomics analyses (unless not 
allowed per local regulation) and urine will be collected for biomarker analysis. 
Method of Randomization and Blinding:  
The sp onsor, investigators, study staff (except for staff involved in bioanalytical analyses), and 
patients will be blinded to treatment assignment during the double-blind period.  A computer-
generated master randomization list will be provided to drug packaging facilities. Packaging 
vendor(s) will package active drug and placebo into single-visit kits according to Good 
Manufacturing Practice procedures. Kits will be identical in appearance and contain 1 prefilled 
syringe with active drug or placebo. Adequate kit supply for upcoming study visits will be 
managed by [CONTACT_142905] (refrigerated at 2°C to 8°C) on site. 
In this randomized study, the double-blind period will be stratified based on CM or EM, gender, 
country, and a special treatment failure group defined as patients who must have had inadequate 
response to valproic acid. In addition, patients in the special treatment failure group must have 
had inadequate response to 2 to 3 other classes  of migraine preventive medications as defined 
in Appendix H . 
Each patient will undergo randomization in a 1:1:1 ratio within the stratum to which he or she belongs to receive 1 of the 2  fremanezumab dose regimens or placebo, as assigned by [CONTACT_6606]. 
The IRT will manage initial drug  supply, maintenance of adequate study drug supplies on site, 
and study randomization centrally. At the time of each study visit, the IRT will be queried, and site personnel will retrieve and administer a 1.5 -mL volume from each syringe contained in the 
appropriately numbered kit(s). 
The open- label period will not be randomized as all patients will receive the same monthly dose 
(225 mg fremanezumab).

Statistical Considerations:  
Sample Size Rationale:  In the Phase 2b study f or CM (S tudy LBR -101-021), the treatment 
difference between 675/225/225 mg and placebo in change from baseline in monthly average migraine days was 2.1 days (SD=5.2 days). In the phase 2b study for EM (S tudy LBR -101-022), 
the treatment difference between 2 25 mg monthly dose and placebo in change from baseline in 
monthly average migraine days was 2.7 days (SD=4.1 days). In the Phase 3 study for CM ( Study 
TV48125- CNS -[ZIP_CODE]), the treatment differences to placebo in change from baseline in monthly 
average migraine days were 1.7 days and 1.8 days for the quarterly dose and the monthly dose, respectively (SD=5.4 days). In the Phase 3 study for EM ( Study TV48125- CNS -[ZIP_CODE]), the 
treatment differences to placebo in change from baseline in monthly average migraine days were 
1.3 days and 1.5 days for the quarterly dose and the monthly dose, respectively (SD=3.4 days). 
Combining the information above, a treatment difference of 1.8 days is used. Considering the patient population is different from the previous studies, a SD of 6 days is used to account for the complexity and uncertainty of this study. 
A sample size of 705 (235 patients per treatment group) evaluable patients completing the study 
is needed for 90% power to show a 1.8 difference in migraine days (assuming a common 
standard deviation [SD] of 6 days) at an alpha level of 0.05. Assuming a 12% discontinuation 
rate for the double-blind period, 268 patients per treatment group will be randomized. 
Analysis of Primary Endpoint: For the purpose of this study, a migraine day is endorsed when 
at least one of the following occurs: 
• a calendar day (0:00 to 23:59) demonstrating at least 4 consecutive hours of a 
headache, meeting criteria for migraine with or without aura (see Appendix U ) 
• a calendar day (0:00 to 23:59) demonstrating at least 4 consecutive hours of a 
headache meeting criteria for probable migraine, a migraine subtype where only 1 migraine criterion is missing (see App endix U ) 
• a calendar day (0:00 to 23:59) demonstrating a headache of any duration that was treated with migraine - specific acute medications (triptans and ergot compounds)  
A headache day of at least moderate severity is endorsed when at least 1 of the following situations occurs:  
• a calendar day (0:00 to 23:59) demonstrating at least [ADDRESS_162352] moderate severity  
• a calendar day (0:00 to 23:59) demonstrating a headache of any duration that was treated with migraine - specific acute medications (triptans and ergot compounds) 
Analysis of Secondary Endpoints: The analysis of the secondary endpoints is specified in the statistical section of the protocol ( Section  9.5.2). 
Primary Efficacy  Analysis: The primary efficacy endpoint will be analyzed using an analysis of 
covariance (ANCOVA) method. The model will include treatment, gender, region, special group 
 Placebo -Controlled Study– Migraine  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 01  Study TV48125- CNS -[ZIP_CODE] 
 25 
Protocol Version 2 with Amendment 01, 23 October 2017 of treatment failure (Yes or No), migraine classification (ie, CM or EM), and treatme nt-by-
migraine classification interaction as fixed effects, and baseline number of migraine days and 
years since onset of migraines as covariates. The treatment comparison between each fremanezumab treatment group (monthly dose and quarterly dose) and placebo for monthly 
average migraine days will be conducted under this model using the estimate statement. Ninety-
five percent confidence intervals will be constructed for the least squares means differences between each fremanezumab treatment group (monthly d ose and quarterly dose) and placebo.  
Note: Special treatment failure group defined as patients who must have had inadequate response to valproic acid. In addition, patients in the special treatment failure group must have had 
inadequate response to 2 to 3 other classes  of migraine preventive medications as defined 
in Appendix H . 
Sensitivity Analysis: Sensitivity analysis will be performed by [CONTACT_142907] 1- [ADDRESS_162353] square means differences 
between each fremaez umab treatment group (monthly dose and quarterly dose) and placebo will 
be constructed. The detailed SAS code for imputation and analysis procedure will be provided in the statistical analysis plan. This sensitivity analysis will be performed on the ITT an alysis set.  
Sensitivity analysis will also be performed using a mixed -effects repeated measures (MMRM) 
analysis model. If a patient is early terminated or has intermittent missing days and has fewer than 10 days of e-diary entries for a month, that month’s value will be considered as missing. The MMRM model will include  treatment, gender, region, special group of treatment failure 
(Yes or No), migraine classification (ie, CM or EM),  month, treatment- by-migraine 
classification  interaction, and treatment- by-month interaction as fixed effects, baseline value and 
years since onset of migraines as covariates, and patient in the repeated statement as a random effect. The treatment comparison between each fremanezumab treatment group (monthly dose 
and quarterly dose) and placebo for monthly average migraine days will be conducted under this model using the estimate statement. Ninety -five percent confidence intervals will be constructed 
for the least squares means differences between each fremanezumab treatment gro up (monthly 
dose and quarterly dose) and placebo. This sensitivity analysis will be performed on the mITT analysis set.  
Note: Special treatment failure group defined as patients who must have had inadequate response to valproic acid. In addition, patients in the special treatment failure group must have had 
inadequate response to 2 to 3 other classes  of migraine preventive medications as defined 
in Appendix H . 
Secondary Efficacy Analysis: The continuous secondary efficacy endpoints will be analyzed similarly as the primary efficacy endpoint. For the proportion of responders, defined as 50% or 
more reduction from baseline in the monthly average number of migraine days, a logistic 
regression model will be used with the following effects: treatment, gender, region, special group of treatment failure (Yes or No),  and migraine classification (ie, CM or EM). The odds ratios, 
95% confidence intervals, for odds ratios, and p- values will be presented for each fremanezumab 
treatment group (monthly dose and quarterly dose) comparing to placebo.

Protocol Version 2 with Amendment 01, 23 October 2017 Multiple Comparisons and Multiplicity:  The Hochberg’s method along with hierarchical 
testing procedure for multiple comparisons between treatment groups (2 comparisons: 
fremanezumab monthly dose compared with placebo and fremanezumab quarterly dose compared with placebo) for the primary and secondary endpoint analyses will be used to maintain the experiment- wise type I er ror of 5%.  
In the primary analysis, according to the Hochberg’s method, if the null hypothesis is rejected for both the fremanezumab monthly and quarterly treatment groups at an alpha level of 5%, then no 
adjustment to the alpha level will be performed and both comparisons will be declared as 
statistically significant. The secondary variables will then be tested in the order as specified in Section  9.5.2 for both the fremanezumab monthly and quarterly treatment groups using the same 
procedure as the primary analysis. If the null hypothesis is not rejected for 1 of the doses at an alpha level of 5%, then the other dose will be tested using an alpha level of 5%/2=2.5%, and the sequential testing will stop.  
No multiplicity adjustments will be made for the exploratory efficacy analyses.  
Analysis of Exploratory Endpoints:  For the double-blind period, the continuous exploratory 
efficacy endpoints will be analyzed similarly as the primary efficacy endpoint. For the 
proportions of responders for the double-blind period, a logistic regression model will be used 
similarly as the secondary efficacy endpoint.  
For the open-label period, the exploratory efficacy endpoints for the open-label period will be 
summarized using descri ptive statistics.  
Safety Analyses: Safety analyses will be performed on the safety analysis set.  
Safety assessments and time points are provided in Table 2. 
All adverse events will be coded using the Medical Diction ary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA). Each patient will be counted only once in each preferred term or system organ class

Protocol Version 2 with Amendment 01, 23 October 2017 1. INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND INFORMATION 
1.1. Introduction  
1.1.1. Disease Overview  
Migraine is a prevalen t condition characterized by [CONTACT_65940] 
(such as nausea, photophobia, or phonophobia). The [ADDRESS_162368] common forms of migraine, 
migraine without aura and migraine with aura, occur on less than 15 days per month and are 
referred  to as epi[INVESTIGATOR_72431] (EM) ( Lipton et al 2007). However, 3% to 6% of 
individuals with EM evolve, in any given year, to a significantly more disabling condition called 
chronic migraine (CM) ( Scher et al 2003 ). Individuals with CM present with headaches of any 
severity on [ADDRESS_162369] 8 days per month. A sizable 
proportion of individuals with CM experience daily headaches and, therefore, faces considerable disability ( Bigal and Lipton 2008).  
1.1.2. Rationale for Fremanezumab Development as a Preventive Treatment for 
Migraine 
The goals of migraine treatment are to relieve pain, restore function, reduce headache frequency, 
and to prevent progression of EM to CM. Pharmacological interventions for the treatment of migraine include acute (symptomatic) treatments and preventive medications.  
Preventive drug treatment may be appropriate in a number of instances, including where 
frequency of attacks per month is two or higher, or where a patient’s quality of life is severely 
impaired ( Evers et al 2009). A number of drugs from different pharmacological categories 
(eg, beta blockers, anticonvulsants) have been approved for migraine prevention or have class A 
evidence to support their use. However, compliance and adherence to these medications can be poor, and there is a need for preventive medications which are more effective and better tolerated 
than the current standard of care ( Puledda et al 2017).  
Calcitonin gene- related peptide (CGRP) is a well -studied neuropeptide found at the  centers  of 
the migraine processes, both centrally and peripherally ( Eftekhari and Edvinsson 2010). Jugular 
levels of CGRP are increased during migraine attacks, and intravenous CGRP administration induces migraine- like headache in most individuals with migraine ( Ashina et al 2000, Hansen et 
al 2010). CGRP is involved in the pathophysiology of migraine at all levels, peripherally (vasodilation, inflammation and protein extravasation), at the trigeminal ganglion, and inside the brain ( Ho et al 2010). Studies have shown that inhibition of CGRP was efficacious in the 
treatment of EM ( Hewitt et al 2011 , Ho et al 2008, Olesen et al 2004 ) and CM ( Bigal et al 
2015b).  
Fremanezumab (TEV -[ZIP_CODE] [formerly LBR- 101, PF -04427429, and RN307]) is a fully 
humanized IgG 2a/kappa monoclonal antibody, which is being developed for administration by [CONTACT_142909]. Fremanezumab is a potent, selective CGRP binder that blocks both CGRP isoforms (α - and β -CGRP) from binding to the CGRP receptor. 
Fremanezumab is specific for CGRP and does not bind to closely related family members (eg, amylin, calcitonin, intermedin, and adrenomedullin). Two mutations were introduced into 
 Placebo -Controlled Study– Migraine  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 01  Study TV48125- CNS -[ZIP_CODE] 
 39 
Protocol Version 2 with Amendment 01, 23 October 2017 the constant region of the fremanezumab heavy chain to limit antibody effector functions. This 
loss of function prevents fremanezumab from stimulating antibody- dependent cell -mediated 
cytotoxicity and triggering complement- mediated lysis, which can lead to unwanted 
consequences such as cell lysis, opsonization, and cytokine release and inflammation ( Armour et 
al 1999, Zeller et al 2008 ). 
The safety and tolerability of fremanezumab (intravenous [iv] doses ranging from 0.2 to 
2000 mg and sc doses of 225 mg and 900 mg) has been well- characterized in the Phase 1 
development program (see the Investigator’s Brochure for more details). Furthermore, the safety and efficacy of fremanezumab  of fremanezumab has been demonstrated in a randomized 
double-blind, placebo controlled Phase 2 study of 2 sc dosing regimens of fremanezumab 
(monthly fremanezumab at 900 mg or fremanezumab at 675 mg followed by [CONTACT_142910] 225 mg) in patients with CM and a randomized, double-blind, placebo -controlled Phase 2 study of 2 sc dosing regimens of fremanezumab (monthly 
fremanezumab at 675 or 225 mg) in patients with EM. Furthermore, the efficacy and tolerability profile have been confirmed in the Phase 3 development program. 
The demonstrated efficacy, acceptable tolerability, long terminal elimination half -life 
(t
½, approximately 32-36 days), and ability to administer sc, make fremanezumab a potential 
therapeutic candidate for patients who failed prior preventive treatment for CM and EM. 
1.1.3. Study Purpose  
The purpose of the study is to determine whether fremanezumab is effective in the prophylactic 
treatment of migraine in patients with inadequate response to 2 to 4 classes of prior preventive 
treatments.  
1.2. Findings from Nonclinical and Clinical Studies  
Brief summaries of nonclinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and toxicology studies and 
clinical studies are provided in the following sections. More detailed information is provided in 
the Investigator’s Brochure.  
1.2.1. Nonclinical Studies  
In vivo pharmacology studies of fremanezumab in animal models indicate that fremanezumab 
prevented an increase in blood flow in rat paw skin and the middle meningeal artery after 
electrical stimulation and produced a dose- dependent inhibition of the capsaicin-induced skin 
flare response in cynomolgus monkey. 
Safety pharmacology parameters of fremanezumab were assessed in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_142874] a separate cardiovascular safe ty 
pharmacology study in male cynomolgus monkeys. There were no treatment- related changes in 
electrocardiograms (ECGs) and heart rates in the 1 - and 3-month toxicity studies, and a single iv  
dose of fremanezumab at 100 mg/kg did not result in changes in ca rdiovascular parameters or 
body temperature in monkeys. Additionally, no target organ toxicity was identified. In these 
referenced studies, the no-observed-adverse-effect level ranged from 100 to 300 mg/kg dosed 
either iv or sc. In a 3-month monkey study, perivascular inflammation of the ciliary artery was observed in a few animals at doses ≥100 mg/kg. The inflammation was suspected to be the result 
 Placebo -Controlled Study– Migraine  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 01  Study TV48125- CNS -[ZIP_CODE] 
 40 
Protocol Version 2 with Amendment 01, 23 October 2017 of immune complex formation/deposition from the monkeys’ immunogenic response to the drug 
(fremanezumab). In the pi[INVESTIGATOR_22735] 6 -month chronic toxicity study in monkeys following once-
weekly sc dosing at dosage levels of up to 300 mg/kg/week, achieving high exposure throughout 
the study, no microscopic findings were noted in any of the organs, including the ciliary ves sels 
of the eyes, and the no- observed -adverse-effect level of the chronic toxicity study was 
determined to be the highest dose tested, 300 mg/kg/week. Thus, it is believed that in view of the low frequency (ie, observed in very few animals) and minimal severity, the finding (perivascular 
inflammation) that was only recorded in the 3 -month toxicity study, and had been resolved 
during the recovery period, is an incidental finding. 
The pharmacokinetics of fremanezumab in animals (rats and monkeys) is typi[INVESTIGATOR_12340] a humanized 
IgG2 molecule, with low mean plasma clearance, low volume of distribution at steady state, and 
a long t
½. Exposure as defined by [CONTACT_72509] (C max) and 
the area under the plasma concentration -time curve (AUC) increased linearly across doses 
following single and repeated once-weekly dosing. No gender differences in exposure were observed in rats or monkeys. 
Additionally, pi[INVESTIGATOR_142875]. Preliminary data suggest that weekly dosing with 
fremanezumab was well tolerated and did not induce any obvious maternal toxicity at any dose level. No apparent evidence of embryo-fetal toxicity was noted in any dose group. 
Overall, no toxicological concerns were identified following up to 6 months of dosing to the 
experimental animals.  
Further details may be found in the current Investigator’s Brochure. 
1.2.2. Clinical Studies  
The clinical program to date is composed of 7 comple ted Phase 1 clinical studies in healthy 
subjects (Studies B0141001, B0141002, B0141006, B0141007, LBR-101- 008, LBR -101-011 
and TV48125- PK-[ZIP_CODE]), 1 ongoing Phase 1 bioequivalence study (TV48125- BE-[ZIP_CODE]), 
2 completed Phase 2b clinical studies in patients w ith migraine (Studies  LBR -101-021 and 
LBR -101-022), and 2 completed Phase 3 clinical studies in patients with migraine (Studies 
TV48125- CNS -[ZIP_CODE] and TV48125- CNS -[ZIP_CODE]). A total of 2884 subjects/patients (318 healthy 
subjects and 2566 patients with migraine) have participated across these clinical studies, and 
1958 of these subjects/patients (256 healthy subjects and 1702 patients with migraine [929 patients with CM and 773 patients with EM]) have
 received at least 1 dose (iv or sc) of 
fremanezumab. One Pha se 3 study (TV48125- CNS -[ZIP_CODE]) is currently ongoing to further 
evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of various dose regimens of fremanezumab in the preventive treatment of migraine (CM and EM).  
In addition, 2 Phase 3 studies (Studies TV48125- CNS -[ZIP_CODE] and TV48125- CNS -[ZIP_CODE]) are 
ongoing and 1 Phase 3 study (TV48125- CNS -[ZIP_CODE]) is planned to evaluate the efficacy, safety, 
and tolerability of various dose regimens of fremanezumab in the preventive treatment of cluster headache.  
A brief summary of clinical pharmacology and clinical safety and efficacy studies of fremanezumab follows.

 41 
Protocol Version 2 with Amendment 01, 23 October 2017 [IP_ADDRESS]. Clinical Pharmacology Studies 
A total of 118 healthy subjects received fremanezumab across 6 completed Phase 1 studies in 
doses ranging from 0.2 through 2000 mg. Studies included 2 single- ascending -dose 
pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies in healthy men (Studies B0141001 and 
B0141002); a 2-cohort, placebo- controlled crossover study to examine the acute effects of 
administration of fremanezumab on capsaicin flare res ponse in healthy men (Study B0141006); a 
parallel -group, repeat -dose study of fremanezumab in healthy subjects (Study B0141007); a 
single -dose study evaluating the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of doses up to 
2000 mg administered iv in healthy  women (Study LBR-101- 008 [formerly referred to as 
Study B0141008]); and a study assessing the safety, tolerability, absolute bioavailability, and pharmacokinetics of single iv or sc doses of fremanezumab in healthy subjects (Study 
LBR -101-011).These Phase 1 studies were analyzed using the original bioanalytical method that 
has been determined to be unreliable and underestimate measured plasma concentrations 
compared to the current validated assay.  
A recently completed pharmacokinetic, safety, and tolerabil ity study in healthy Japanese and 
Caucasian subjects (TV48125- PK-[ZIP_CODE]) dosed fremanezumab as a single sc dose of 225, 
675 or 900 mg. Plasma concentration- time profile was measured using the current validated 
bioanalytical method and the pharmacokinetic results are described below. The pharmacokinetics (non- compartmental analysis) of fremanezumab demonstrated an increase in C
max and AUCs 
values slightly greater than dose proportionality over sc dose range of 225 to 900 mg. Median 
time to maximum observed co ncentration (t max) values generally occurred [ADDRESS_162370] sc 
doses. Mean values for apparent volume of distribution (V z/F) after a single sc dose ranged from 
5.7 to 6.4 L at 225 mg to 900 mg sc doses. The mean apparent total body clearance (CL/F) range d from 0.0777 to 0.0895 mL/min at this dose range. The mean t
½ ranged from 32.2 to 
36.2 days. Fremanezumab exposure parameters and overall pharmacokinetic profile was similar 
for healthy Japanese and Caucasian subjects. Absolute bioavailability following s c 
administration of fremanezumab was approximately 54% to 57%. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Clinical Safety and Efficacy Studies  
The safety, tolerability, and efficacy of fremanezumab have been evaluated in 2 completed 
Phase 2b studies, Studies LBR-101- 021 and LBR -101-022, in patients with migraine ( Bigal et al 
2015a , Bigal et al 2015b). The results of both studies showed fremanezumab to be superior to 
placebo for primary and secondary endpoints (benefit at 3 months of thera py). 
Fremanezumab was well tolerated with favorable safety profile across the 6 completed Phase 1, 
2 completed Phase 2b studies, and 2 completed Phase 3 studies. The treatment- emergent adverse 
events reported in the Phase 1, Phase 2b, and Phase 3 studies were predominantly mild to 
moderate in severity. A specific “pattern of adverse events” that could be associated with a dose 
or a dose range of fremanezumab has not been identified, nor has a maximally tolerated dose 
been identified. Overall, the nature and occurrence of the reported treatment -related adverse 
events across the clinical program have not raised any specific safety concerns.  
Two pi[INVESTIGATOR_30338] 3 studies in EM and CM patients confirmed efficacy findings in phase 2 
(Studies TV48125- CNS -[ZIP_CODE] and TV48125- CNS -[ZIP_CODE]). Study TV48125- CNS -[ZIP_CODE] was a

dosing with fremanezumab at 675 mg [675/225/225-mg; N=376] and a loading dose of 
fremanezumab at 675  mg followed by [CONTACT_142911] 225 mg [675 mg/ 
placebo/placebo; N=379]) and placebo (N=375) in adults (18 through 70 years of age) with CM. 
Patients who wer e on monotherapy (79%) and patients on stable doses of preventive medications 
(21%) were included in the study. The study consisted of a screening visit, a run- in period lasting 
approximately 4  weeks (~28 days), and a treatment period lasting approximately [ADDRESS_162371] dose of study drug, demonstrated statistically significant differences from placebo in favor 
of fremanezumab (p<0.0001) for both active treatment groups. The median for the overall change from baseline of -4.2 and -4.5 (mean reduction of 4.7 and 4.9 days) vs. -2.5 (mean 
reduction of 2.9 days) headache day s of at least moderate severity for the 
675 mg/placebo/placebo and 675/225/[ADDRESS_162372] square (LS) mean difference with placebo was 1.8 days for 675 mg/placebo/placebo and 2.1 days for 675/225/225 mg.  
Statis tically significant improvements (p<0.0001 for both comparisons versus placebo) were 
evident as early as month 1 (secondary endpoint), and a treatment effect in favor of the fremanezumab treatment groups was also evident in months 2 and 3 (exploratory endpoints). The 
results of the analyses of each of the other secondary endpoints further support the efficacy of 
both fremanezumab dose regimens; all comparisons versus placebo were statistically significant. Thus, patients treated with fremanezumab were signi ficantly more likely to be responders 
(≥50%  reduction in the number of headache days of at least moderate severity), had significantly 
fewer migraine days and days with use of acute headache medication, and they reported significantly less disability than patients treated with placebo. In addition, the overall treatment 
effect on headache days of at least moderate severity was also observed in the subset of patients 
(79% of patients) who were not receiving concomitant preventive medication.  
Fremanezumab at  the doses tested was generally safe and well tolerated for [ADDRESS_162373] frequent

Protocol Version 2 with Amendment 01, 23 October 2017 demonstrated statistically significant differences from placebo in favor of fremanezumab 
(p<0.0001) for both active treatment groups. The median for the overall change from baseline

respectively. The LS mean difference with placebo of 1.3  days for 675 mg/placebo/placebo and 
1.5 days for 225/225/225 mg.  
Statistically significant improvements (p<0.0001 for both comparisons versus placebo) were evident as early as month 1 (secondary endpoint), and a treatment effect in favor of the

1.3.1. Known and Potential Benefits and Risks of Fremanezumab 
Additional information regarding benefits and risks to patients may be found in the Investigator’s Brochure . 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Identified Risks  
[IP_ADDRESS].1. General Disorders and Administrat ive Site Conditions  
Reports of transient administration site disorders/reactions, including injection site bruising, injection site swelling, administration site pain, injection site pain, injection site pruritus, injection site induration, injection site erythema, injection site inflammation, injection site 
warmth, injection site extravasation, injection site dermatitis, injection site rash, injection site 
edema, injection site discomfort, injection site hemorrhage, injection site irritation, injection site mass, and injection site hematoma, have occurred with sc administration. In addition, mild and 
transient infusion site pain and swelling after iv administration were reported. Among these 
events, the following have been identified as adverse drug reactio ns (identified risks): injection 
site erythema, administration site pain, injection site pain, injection site pruritus, and injection site dermatitis. None of the identified risks were considered important risks.

Protocol Version 2 with Amendment 01, 23 October 2017 [IP_ADDRESS].2. Injury, Poisoning, and Procedural Complicat ions/Immune System Disorders  
The general risks of infusion reactions with monoclonal antibody administration include fever, 
headache, nausea, vomiting, and hypotension. These adverse events are generally ascribed to 
lysis of cellular targets, cytokine rele ase, or complement activation.  
Type I hypersensitivity or allergic reactions (eg, shortness of breath, urticaria, anaphylaxis, angioedema) are theoretically possible with any injected protein.  
Type III hypersensitivity reactions occur as a consequence of an antibody response to the injected protein resulting in immune complex formation. Such immune complex formation and 
subsequent deposition in tissues may result in symptoms, including rash, urticaria, polyarthritis, 
myalgias, polysynovitis, fever, neuritis, or angioedema, and if untreated and severe, can progress to glomerulonephritis.  
Infusion-related reaction and drug hypersensitivity have been identified as adverse drug reactions. To date, [ADDRESS_162376]  in 
Study LBR -101-021 has had drug hypersensitivity considered related to the study drug.

monitored during the infusion per protocol and was normal throughout. No reports of 
hypo tension or tachycardia were made by [CONTACT_093]. The first protocol 
scheduled vital signs assessment was performed approximately [ADDRESS_162378] 
been observed in clinical studies. 
•  (monthly sc fremanezumab 900-mg treatment group), a  
 with a medical history of hypersensitivity and drug hypersens itivity to 
sulfa drugs, had a treatment -emergent adverse event of drug hypersensitivity assessed 
as moderate in severity and related to the study drug. The event led to permanent 
discontinuation of the study drug. The patient received diphenhydramine 
hydro chloride and methylprednisolone for the event that started 1 day after the patient 
received  second dose of study drug, and the event was reported as resolved after 
23 days. No reports of hypotension or tachycardia were made by [CONTACT_093].

[IP_ADDRESS].1. Perivascular Inflammation 
In the 3-month monkey toxicology study, inflammation around the ciliary vessel of the eye was observed. Based on the low-grade increase in immune complex deposits observed in the intima and/or media of ciliary vessels in the animals with perivascular inflammation, these events were 
assessed as being due to the monkeys’ immunogenic response to humanized monoclonal

setting. Moreover, a confirmatory 6-month study could not repeat the findings. 
[IP_ADDRESS].2. Consequences of Calcitonin Gene -Related Peptide Inhibition  
Because CGRP is a vasodilator, the following 4 major cardiovascular effects are of potential 
concern with CGRP inhibition, a priori: me dication -induced hypertension, counterbalancing the 
effect of anti -hypertensive drugs that have vasodilatory properties, inhibition of stress- (or 
ischemia -) induced vasodilation, and impairment of cardioprotective mechanisms. Extensive 
research conducted with the CGRP receptor antagonists has not identified relevant safety 
cardiovascular concerns in humans. Dedicated studies conducted in monkey and in humans using 
fremanezumab have not identified clinically relevant changes in heart rate, blood pressure, or other cardiovascular parameters. No relevant cardiovascular event has been seen in the completed studies. 
1.3.2. Overall Benefit and Risk Assessment for This Study  
In summary, the benefit/risk assessment for fremanezumab is favorable following review of all 
available efficacy and safety data.

2.1.1. Justification of Primary Endpoint  
The primary endpoint was chosen based on the IHS guidelines for trials in migraine which 
suggest that the most appropriate primary endpoint to ca pture efficacy of treatment is the change 
from baseline in the monthly average number of migraine days ( Silberstein et al 2008).

EM is defined as:  
The patient fulfills the following criteria for EM in prospectively collected baseline information during the 28-day run-in period: 
• Headache occurring ≥6 days but <15  
• On ≥4 days, fulfilling any of the following:  
− ICHD -3 diagnostic criteria C and D for 1.1 Migraine without aura 
− ICHD -3 criteria B and C for 1.2 Migraine with aura 
− Probable migraine (a migraine subtype where only 1 migraine criterion is missing)  
− The patient used a triptan or ergot derivative to treat an established headache 
Blinded treatment will be administered sc once a month (approximately every 28 days) for a total of 3 doses (visits 2,3, and 4)  
Open -label period  
After visit 4, all patients completing the double -blind period will enter the open-label period. All 
patients (CM and EM) will receive sc 225 mg of fremanezumab monthly for 3 months (visits  5, 
6, and 7). 
The open- label period will not be randomized as all patients will receive the same monthly dose 
(225 mg fremanezumab).  
Open -label treatment will adminis tered for a total of 3 doses (visits 5, 6, and 7). Final study 
assessments will be performed at visit 8 (end-of- treatment [EOT] visit), approximately [ADDRESS_162399] dose of fremanezumab.  
Follow up period 
A follow- up visit will be sch eduled 6.0 months (> 5 half- lives) after the last study drug 
administration for ADA blood sampling. Patients who discontinue early will have the follow-up 
visit 6.[ADDRESS_162400] dose.

3.1. Planned Number of Patients and Countries  
Approximately 804 patients (268 patients per treatment group) are planned to be enrolled in this 
study to have approximately 705 completers (235 completers per treatment group). A 12% drop- out rate is anticipated.  
The study is planned to be conducted in approximately 15 countries in approximately120 investigational centers.  
3.2. Justification for Study Design and Selection of Population  
The study population will be composed of female and male patients, aged 18 to 70 years, 
inclusive, with a history of migraine (as defined by [CONTACT_72514], 3rd revision [ICHD- 3] criteria [ IHS 2013]) for at least [ADDRESS_162402] documented history of inadequate response to 2 to 4 classes of prior preventive 
medication treatments for migraine and a subset of patients (at least 120) will have  documented 
inadequate response to [ADDRESS_162403] 10 years (in medical 
chart or by [CONTACT_35425] ’s confirmation, see Appendix I . Fremanezumab is expected to be a 
later line treatment in the EU. This study is intended to generate data for that specific population defined within EM and CM. 
The same dosing regimens used in the phase 3 studies will be investigated in the double-blind 
period. One of the dosing regimens from the phase 3 studies expected to be efficacious for this 
study population will be used in the open-label period. 
A randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled design is appropriate given t he 
objectives of this study. Furthermore, this design is consistent with the recommendations of the Week 46

(Tfelt -Hansen et al 2012 ). 
3.3. Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_142878], serious adverse events will be reviewed (see Section  7.1.5) as 
they are reported from the investigational centers  to identify safety concerns.  
The study may be terminated by [CONTACT_23496]. For example, the sponsor should terminate the study in the event of: 
• new toxicological or pharmacological findings or safety issues invalidating the earlier positive benefit- risk assessment  
• development of the IMP being discontinued 
A patient may discontinue participation in the study at any time for any reason (eg, lack of 
efficacy, consent withdrawn, or adverse event). The investigator and/or sponsor can withdraw a 
patient from the study at any time  for any reason (eg, protocol deviation as defined in 
Appendix C , noncompliance, or adverse event). In addition, patients with positive eC- SSRS 
findings or abnormal hepatic laboratory values (eg, alanine aminotr ansferase [ALT], aspartate 
aminotransferase [AST], alkaline phosphatase [ALP], gamma- glutamyl transpeptidase [GGT], 
bilirubin [total, direct, or indirect], or international normalized ratio [INR]) may meet criteria for discontinuation from the IMP as summa rized in  Appendix R .  
3.4. Schedule of Study Procedures and Assessments  
Study procedures and assessments with their time points are presented in Table 2. 
Note that blood samples for plasma drug concentration determination will be collected prior to 
dosing (where applicable) at visits 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8.

If the reason for withdrawal from the study or discontinuation from IMP is an adverse event and/or clinically significant abnormal laboratory test result, monitoring will be continued as 
applicable (eg, until the event has resolved or stabilized, until the patient is referred to the care of 
a health care professional, or until a determination of a cause unrelated to the IMP or study procedure is made). The specific event or test result (including repeated test results, as 
applicable) must be r ecorded both on the source documentation and in the CRF; both the adverse 
events page and the relevant page of the CRF will be completed at that time . 
 Placebo -Controlled Study– Migraine  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment [ADDRESS_162417] be provided 
when requested.  
If a patient is withdrawn from the study or discontinues IMP for multiple reasons that include 
also adverse events, the relevant page of the CRF should indica te that the withdrawal was related 
to an adverse event. An exception to this requirement will be the occurrence of an adverse event 
that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_142881] a prohibited medication, thereby [CONTACT_16957]. In 
such a case, the reason for discontinuation would be “need to take a prohibited medication”, not the adverse event.  
In the case of patients lost to follow-up, attempts to contact [CONTACT_142913]’s medical records and transcribed to the CRF. 
All protocol- specified procedures/assessments should be performed at the EOT/ early withdrawal 
visit (see Table 2). Pati ents who withdraw from the study will be instructed to come back to the 
site for blood sample collection for the purpose of evaluating ADA 6.0 months (180 days [the 
approximate equivalent of 5 half- lives]) after their last dose of study drug. A patient sho uld only 
be designated as lost to follow up if the site is unable to establish contact [CONTACT_127635] 3 documented attempts via 2 different methods (phone, text, e- mail, certified letter, etc).  
4.4. Replacement of Patients  
A patient who is randomized/enrolled but does not complete the treatment period will not be replaced with another eligible patient.  
4.5. Rescreening  
A patient who is screened and does not meet study inclusion and exclusion criteria will not be considered for screening again . 
4.6. Screening Failu re 
Screening failures are defined as participants who consent to participate in the clinical study but 
are not subsequently randomized/enrolled in the study. Minimal information includes but is not 
limited to demography, screening failure details, eligibility criteria, and any serious adverse events.

Individual, uniquely numbered visit kits containing 1 prefilled syringe with a staked 
27 G ½” needle will be provided. 
At the time of each study visit, the IRT will be queried, and site  personnel will retrieve and 
administer 1.5 mL from each syringe contained in the appropriately numbered kit(s). 
Recommended sc injection sites follow the  National Institutes of Health Patient Education 
Guidelines of June 2012 (see Appendix V ). 
The suggested sites of injection are back of upper arms, lower abdomen/belly/waistline, and front of thighs. Each of the injections should be given in a different location (eg, not in precisely 
the same place/not on top of the previous injection site), and study staff member(s) responsible 
for administration of injections should inspect previous injection sites to ensure that they are free of bruising and tenderness and that proper rotation of sites is performed. 
Study drug should be removed from the refrigerator and allowed to equilibrate at room 
temperature for 45 -60 minutes before study drug administration. A 1.5-mL volume from each 
syringe in each visit’s kit(s) must be injected sc for dosing to be considered complete. The total 
number of sc injections and their locations will be recorded on the CRF for each dosing visit 
(visits 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7).  
 Placebo -Controlled Study– Migraine  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment [ADDRESS_162419] (Fremanezumab)  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Starting Dose and Dose Levels 
For the double-blind period, the starting dose for patients with CM will be 675 mg sc and the 
starting dose for patients with EM will be 225 mg sc or 675 mg  sc. Further doses of 225 mg or 
placebo will be administered sc once monthly. The maximal dose administered sc per treatment 
will be 675 mg.  
For the open- label period, all patients will receive 225 mg fremanezumab monthly.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Dose Modification and Dose Stratification  
No dose modifications were allowed. This is a randomized study with stratification based  on CM or EM (in the double-blind period), 
gender, country, and a special treatment failure group defined as patients who must have had 
inadequate response to valproic acid. In addition, patients in the special treatment failure group must have had inadequate response to 2 to 3 other classes  of migraine preventive medications as 
defined in Appendix H .  
The proportion of CM and EM patients in the study should be approximately 50:50 in each subgroup.  
The open- label period will not be randomized as all patients will receiv e the same monthly dose 
(225 mg fremanezumab).  
5.1.2. Placebo Investigational Medicinal Product 
Placebo (matching the test IMP fremanezumab) will be provided and administered as described 
in Table 3. 
5.2. Preparation, Handling,  Labeling, Storage, and Accountability for 
IMPs 
Information pertaining to the preparation, handling, labeling, storage, and accountability for the IMP used in this study can be found in Appendix G . 
5.3. Justification for Investigational Medicinal Products  
5.3.1. Justification for Dose of Test Investigational Medicinal Product 
Three dose regimens of fremanezumab administered sc were tested during 2 Phase 3 pi[INVESTIGATOR_142882]. Chronic migraine doses were 675 mg loading 
dose/225 mg monthly or 675 mg quarterly and EM doses were 225 mg monthly or 675 mg quarterly.  
During the Phase 2b studies, four dose regimens (ie, EM: monthly 225 mg or 675 mg, and 
CM: monthly 675 mg followed by 225 mg or monthly 900 mg of fremanezumab sc) were tested 
and shown to be effective, safe and well tolerated at the [ADDRESS_162420] the lower dose for administration from two doses that show

Protocol Version 2 with Amendment 01, 23 October 2017 equivalence in efficacy (to avoid higher dose than necessary) the 2 monthly dose regimens of 
225 mg monthly with 675 mg loading dose (CM) or without loading dose (EM) were used as one 
active arm in each of the Phase [ADDRESS_162421] effective dose from Phase 2, while exploring different intervals of 
administration. Furthermore, the addition of the quarterly dose regimen, which was a shared dose level across the migraine continuum, enabled the exploration of the choice of treatment 
convenience and flexibility for patients and physicians, the change in preference and the 
likelihood of patients’ demand for different treatment options. 
The results of the Phase 3 studies, namely statistically significant differences, equally favoring 
monthly and quarterly fremanezumab compared with placebo for all primary and secondary 
endpoints, demonstrate the efficacy of fremanezumab as a preventive treatment for EM and CM in adults. In addition, all active dose regimens showed no significant difference in safety parameters.  
Thus, two dose regimens are included in this study: 225 mg monthly (with 675 mg loading dose at the start of the CM dose regimen) and [ADDRESS_162422] 
A placebo -controlled design is appropriate given the purpose and objectives of this clinical 
study. Inclusion of a placebo control group is consistent with guidelines for controlled trials of 
prophylactic treatment of migraine in adults ( Silberstein et al 2008 ) and the Classification 
Committee of the IHS guidelines for controlled trials of drugs in migraine, 3
rd edition ( Tfelt -
Hansen et al 2012 ). 
5.4. Treatment after the End of the Study  
At the end of the 24-week treatment period, it is expected that patients should return to the care of their treating physicians.  
Patients will return to the inves tigational center approximately 6.[ADDRESS_162423] of care after withdrawal from or termination of the 24 -week treatment 
period, as appropriate. 
5.5. Restrictions 
Patients will be required to comply with the following restrictions: 
 Placebo -Controlled Study– Migraine  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment [ADDRESS_162424] 60 minutes after injection or 
according to medical judgment.  
5.5.2. Blood Donation 
Patients may not donate blood while taking the IMP and for 5 half-lives (6.0 months) after the 
last dose of the IMP. 
5.5.3. Pregnancy  
Restrictions in regard to pregnancy and required laboratory values (ie, serum and urine β -HCG 
tests) are provided in the inclusion and exclusion criteria (Section 4.1 and Section  4.2, 
respectively). Restrictions in regard to contraception methods a re reviewed in Appendix E . 
5.6. Prior and Concomitant Medication or Therapy  
Patients must not be on any migraine prophylactic medications (as defined in  Appendix H ) at the  
time of screening. At least [ADDRESS_162425] passed prior to the screening visit. No migraine 
prophylactic medications (as defined in Appendix H ) are allowed to be initiated during the run-in 
and double-blind treatment period. Medications listed in Appendix H  taken for other reason than 
migraine/headache are also disallowed during the run -in and double- blind period.  
Patients will be allowed to use acute medication to treat acute migraine attacks, as needed. All 
concomitant medications taken during the study, including over-the-counter medications, 
vitamins, or herbal or nutritional supplements, must be recorded with indication, daily dose, and start and stop dat es of administration. All patients will be questioned about concomitant 
medication use at each visit.   
Any prior or concomitant therapy, medication, or procedure that a patient has had within [ADDRESS_162426] or treating physician’s 
affidavit (see Appendix I ) or signed notes from the principal investigator (if he/she is not the 
treating physician) after interviewing the treating physician, will be required as source 
documents to corroborate patient’s report of inadequate response to [ADDRESS_162427] taken any medication s (other than IMP[s]), including 
over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or herbal or nutritional supplements, since the previous 
visit.

 73 
Protocol Version 2 with Amendment 01, 23 October 2017 5.7. Procedures for Monitoring Patient Compliance  
The investigator will be responsible for monitoring patient compliance. If the investigator or the 
sponsor determines that the patient is not in compliance with the study protocol, the investigator 
and the sponsor should determine whether the patient should be withdrawn. The IEC/IRB should be notified. 
5.8.  Randomization and Blindin g 
The sponsor, investigators, study staff (except for staff involved in bioanalytical analyses), and 
patients will be blinded to treatment assignment during the double-blind period. A computer-
generated master randomization list will be provided to drug pa ckaging facilities. Packaging 
vendor(s) will package active drug and placebo into single-visit kits according to Good 
Manufacturing Practice procedures. Kits will be identical in appearance and contain 1 prefilled 
syringe with active drug or placebo. Adequate kit supply for upcoming study visits will be managed by [CONTACT_142905] (refrigerated at 2°C to 8°C) on site. 
In this randomized study, the double-blind period will be stratified based on CM or EM, gender, 
country, and a special treatment failure group defined as patients who must have had inadequate response to valproic acid. In addition, patients in the special treatment failure group must have 
had inadequate response to 2 to 3 other classes  of migraine preventive medications as defined in  
Appendix H . 
Each patient will undergo randomization in a 1:1:1 ratio within the stratum to which he or she 
belongs to receive 1 of the 2  fremanezumab dose regimens or placebo, as assigned by [CONTACT_6606]. 
The IRT will manage initial drug supply, maintenance of adequate study drug supplies on site, 
and study randomization centrally. At the time of each study visit, the IRT will be queried, and 
site personnel will retrieve and administer a 1.5 -mL volume from each syringe contained in the 
appropriately numbered kit(s). 
5.9. Maintenance of Randomization and Blinding  
5.9.1. Maintenance of Randomization  
Patient randomization codes will be maintained in a secure location at the service provider contracted to generate the codes. At the time of the final analysis (after the end of study), after 
receiving unblinding request from Teva statistician, the service provider will provide the unblinded IMP assignment according to the processes defined in the relevant Standard Operating Procedure (SOP).  
5.9.2. Blinding a nd Unblinding  
Blinded pharmacokinetic data may be assessed during the study. Personnel responsible for bioanalysis will be provided with the randomization code in order to facilitate the analysis. 
However, the personnel responsible for bioanalysis will not have access to clinical safety and 
efficacy data and will provide concentration data to other personnel in a manner that will not identify individual patients (ie, a dummy patient identifier will be linked to an individual patient’s concentration data).  
 Placebo -Controlled Study– Migraine  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment [ADDRESS_162428] of any study procedures or assessment of any 
adverse events.  
In case of a serious adverse event or pregnancy, or in cases when knowledge of the study drug 
assignment is needed to make treatment decis ions, the investigator may unblind the patient’s 
drug assignment as deemed necessary, mainly in emergency situations. Individual treatment 
codes, indicating the treatment randomization for each randomized patient, will be available to 
the investigator(s) a t the study center via the IRT, both via telephone and internet. If possible, the 
sponsor should be notified of the event prior to breaking of the code. If this is not possible, the 
sponsor should be notified immediately afterwards, and the patient’s drug code assignment 
should not be revealed. Breaking of the treatment code (in emergency cases) can always be 
performed by [CONTACT_127634]. 
In the event that the IRT system is not functioning for emergency unblinding, the next course of 
action is to contact [CONTACT_142914]-call customer support helpline for manual emergency 
unblinding. Additional contact [CONTACT_142915]. 
When a blind is broken, the patient will be withdrawn from the study, and the event will be 
recorded onto the CRF. The circumstances leading to the breaking of the code should be fully 
documented in the investigator’s study files and in the patient’s source documentation. Treatment assignment should not be recorded in any study documents or source document. 
In this study, for adverse events that are defined as: suspected, unexpected, serious, adverse 
reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R) (ie, reasonable possibility; see Section  7.1.4), Global Patient Safety and 
Pharmacovigilance may independently request that the treatment code be revealed (on a case- by-
case basis) to comply with regulatory requirements. The report will be provided in an unblinded manner for regulatory submission. If this occurs, blinding will be maintained for the investigator and for other personnel involved in the conduct, analysis, and reporting of the data. 
5.9.3. Data Monitoring Committee 
There will be no Data Monitoring Committee in this study.  
5.10. Total Blood Volum e 
The total blood volume to be collected for each patient in this study is approximately 180.5 mL 
for scheduled tests. Details on total blood volume are provided in Appendix J .

Protocol Version 2 with Amendment 01, 23 October 2017 6. ASSESSMENT OF EFFICACY  
Data from any efficacy assessments performed after the specified time will not be collected on 
the CRF. However, in the event that such data are collected, these data will not be analyzed.  
A detailed description of assessments and procedures are presented in Appendix B . 
6.1. Assessments of Efficacy  
The primary efficacy endpoint (and secondary and exploratory efficacy endpoints as well) will be derived from headache variables collected daily using an electronic headache diary device. 
Eligible patients will receive comprehensive training from site personnel on the use of the 
electronic headache diary device. Site personnel will also instruct patients on the requirement for timely and daily completion of the electronic diary. At least 75% compliance is needed after the 
randomization period. Site personnel will monitor patient’s compliance that at least 75% diary 
entry is met during the double-blind and open- label periods.  
On each day, t he patient will be asked to record diary data for the previous 24-hour period. 
Patients may be asked about their performance at work, at school, and when doing household chores (ie, functional assessments). Patients who report headache on the previous day will answer questions about the headache (ie, the number of hours with headache, presence of 
associated symptoms, and use of acute migraine medications). Additional details regarding the 
questions patients will answer can be found in the electronic headache diary training manual.  
If a patient fails to complete the diary for the preceding day, the patient will be prompted to enter 
the missed day’s information the next time he/she accesses the electronic diary provided no more 
than [ADDRESS_162429] moderate severity. 
If headache is reported, then headache severity will be subjectively rated by [CONTACT_72541]: 
• mild headache  
• moderate headache  
• severe headache  
Patients will also record whether photophobia, phonophobia, nausea, and vomiting are present, 
and they will record any migraine medications (name [CONTACT_61144], number of tablets/capsules, and 
the dose in milligrams per tablet/capsule) taken on each day.  
 Placebo -Controlled Study– Migraine  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment [ADDRESS_162430]  
The HIT -6 was developed by [CONTACT_127639] (2003)  as a short form for reliably assessing the 
adverse headache impact in clinical practice and clinical research settings. The questionnaire 
measures the adverse impact of headache on social functioning, role functioning, vitality, cognitive functioning, and psychological distress. It also assesses headache severity. The HIT -[ADDRESS_162431] in patients with migraine ( Yang et al 2011 ). 
Patients will complete the HIT -[ADDRESS_162432] days of activity in 3 domains (work, household work, and nonwork) over the previous [ADDRESS_162433] 5 questions is used for grading of disability, 
with scores of 0 to 5, 6 to 10, 11 to 20, and ≥21 interpreted as disability grades 1 (little or no 
disability), 2 (mild disability), 3 (moderate disability), and 4 (severe  disability), respectively. It 
has been shown to be reliable and valid for migraine, with substantially higher scores in migraine cases than non -migraine cases ( Stewart et al 1999a, Stewart et al  1999b ). 
Patients will complete the MIDAS questionnaire at time points detailed in Table 2. 
6.1.3. Two -Item Patient Health Questionnaire/9 -Item Patient Health Questionnaire  
The PHQ is a 9 -item questionnaire with each item  corresponding to 1 criterion of the Diagnostic 
and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders 4
th edition diagnostic criteria for major depressive 
disorder. Each of the items is scored on a scale of 0 (“not at all”), 1 (“several days”), 2 (“more 
than half the days”), and 3 (“nearly every day”) based on the frequency of symptoms during the 
past 2 weeks ( Spi[INVESTIGATOR_72443] 1999). The PHQ-[ADDRESS_162434] 2 questions from the PHQ-9. The PHQ-2 and the PHQ-9 
are validated measures for detecting and monitoring depression, anxiety, and somatization (Kroenke et al 2010).  
Patients will complete the PHQ -2 at the time points detailed in Table 2. If the PHQ -2 is positive 
(ie, a score of ≥3), patients will complete questions 3 through 9 (unique questions) of the PHQ -9. 
6.1.4. Migraine- Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire  
The MSQOL version 2.[ADDRESS_162435] of migraine and 
migraine treatment on a patient’s quality of life during the previous 4 weeks, which has been shown to be a reliable and valid tool for use in CM and EM ( Bagley et al 2012). The MSQOL 
measures the degree to which perfo rmance of normal activities is limited by [CONTACT_65950] (Role 
Function-Restrictive domain comprising 7 items), the degree to which performance of normal activities is prevented by [CONTACT_65950] (Role Function -Preventive domain comprising 4 items), and 
the emotional effects of migraine (Emotional Function domain comprising 3 items). Scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better health- related quality of life.  
Patients will complete the MSQOL at the time points detailed in Table 2.

Protocol Version 2 with Amendment 01, 23 October 2017 6.1.5. EuroQol- 5 Dimension Questionnaire  
The EQ -5D- 5L is a standardized questionnaire that assesses overall state of health. The 
EQ-5D-5L consists of 2 parts. In Part 1, patients rate their health state in 5 domains: mobility, 
self-care, u sual activities, pain/discomfort, and mood, using a scale of 1 to 5 where 1=no 
problems, 2=slight problems, 3=moderate problems, 4=severe problems, and 5=extreme 
problems. In Part 2, patients rate their health state on a 100 mm visual analog scale; a ratin g of 
[ADDRESS_162436] imaginable 
health state.  
Patients will complete the EQ -5D- 5L at the time points detailed in Table 2.  
6.1.6. Patient Global Impression of Change Scale 
The PGIC scale is a validated generic tool for assessment of overall change in the severity of illness following treatment. Patients will rate how they describe the change (if any) that their 
migraine/headaches have had in their general quality of life and health status since beginning the 
treatment in this study on a 7 -point scale where 1=no change (or condition got worse); 2=almost 
the same, hardly any change at all; 3=a little better, but no noticeable change; 4=somewhat 
better, but the change has not made any real difference; 5=moderately better, and a slight but 
noticeable change; 6=better, and a definite improvement that has made a real and worthwhile difference; and 7=a great deal better, and a considerable improvement that has made all the difference.  
Patients will complete the PGIC scale at the time points detailed in Table 2.  
6.1.7. Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire 
The generic version of the WPAI questionnaire measures t he overall effect of health on 
productivity at work and daily activities. The specific health problems version of the WPAI questionnaire allows investigators to attribute productivity and activity impairment issues to specific health conditions. After the employment status of a respondent is identified, 
3 open-ended questions are asked concerning (1) hours absent from work due to health problems 
(or specific condition), (2) hours absent from work due to other reasons, and (3) hours actually worked. Two additional questions are included that ask about the impact of health on 
productivity, 1 concerning productivity at work and the other concerning daily activities outside 
of work. The response format of each item of the WPAI questionnaire consists of an 11-point scale ranging from 0 (no impairment) to 10 (complete impairment) ( Reilly et al 1993 ). 
Patients will complete the WPAI questionnaire at the time points detailed in Table 2.

7.1. Adverse Events  
7.1.1. Definition of an Adverse Event  
Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical pr oduct and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with 
this treatment.  
An adverse event can, therefore, be any unfavorable and unintended physical sign, symptom, or laboratory parameter that develops or worsens in severity during the course of this study, or 
significant worsening of the disease under study, or of any concurrent disease, whether or not 
considered related to fremanezumab. A new condition or the worsening of a pre- existing 
condition will be considered an adverse event. Stable chronic conditions (such as arthritis) that are present before study entry and do not worsen during this  study will not be considered adverse 
events.  
Accordingly, an adverse event can include any of the following: 
• intercurrent illnesses  
• physical injur ies 
• events possibly related to concomitant medication  
• significant worsening (change in nature, severity, or frequency) of the disease under study or other pre- existing conditions  
• drug interactions 
• events occurring during diagnostic procedures or during any washout phase of this  
study 
• laboratory or diagnostic test abnormalities that result in the withdrawal of the patient 
from the study, are associated with clinical signs and symptoms or a serious adverse 
event, require medical treatment or further diagnosti c work -up, or are considered by 
[CONTACT_11150].  
Note: Abnormal laboratory or diagnostic test results at the screening visit that preclude a patient from entering the study or receiving study treatment are not considered adver se events.

patients with elevated liver function tests.  
Migraine exacerbations, including acute headache requiring headache medications,  will be 
collected as part of the efficacy assessment in this study. Migraine exacerbations (including acute 
headache) should be recorded as an adverse event only if the presentation and/or outcome is 
more severe than would typi[INVESTIGATOR_65890] a particular patient or if they are severe enough to require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_65891], in which case they are recorded as serious adverse events.  
Medical occurrences that begin before signing ICF will be recorded on the  medical 
history/current medical conditions section of the CRF 
7.1.2. Recording and Reporting of Adverse Events  
For recording of adverse events, the study period is defined for each patient as the time period 
from signature [CONTACT_28514]-up period. The follow-up 
period of recording of adverse events is defined as 6.[ADDRESS_162440] (see 
Section  7.1.7) the serious and protocol defined adverse event report form must be completed and 
the serious adverse event or protocol defined adverse event of special interest must be reported 
immediately (Section  [IP_ADDRESS]).  The investigator does not need to actively monitor patients for 
adverse events once the study has ended. Serious adverse events and adverse events of special interest occurring in a patient after the defined study period should be reported to the sponsor if the investigator becomes aware of them, following the procedures described in Section  [IP_ADDRESS].1. 
At each contact [CONTACT_10970], the investigator or designee must question the patient about adverse events by [CONTACT_23501] -ended question such as “Have you had any unusual symptoms 
or medical problems since the last visit? If yes, please describe.” All reported or observed signs 
and symptoms will be recorded individually, except when considered manifestations of a 
medical condition or disease state. A precise diagnosis will be recorded whenever possible. When such a diagnosis is made, all related signs, symptoms, and any test findings will be 
recorded collectively as a single diagnosis on the CRF and, if it is a serious adverse event, on the 
serious adverse event form.  
The clinical course of each adverse event will be monitored at suitable intervals until resolved, 
stabilized, or returned to baseline; or until the patient is referred for continued care to a health 
care professional; or until a determination of a cause unrelated to the IMP or study procedure is made.  
The onset and end dates, duration (in case of adverse event duration of less than 24 hours), action taken regarding IMP, treatment administered, and outcome for each adverse event must be recorded both on the source documentation and the CRF. 
 Placebo -Controlled Study– Migraine  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment [ADDRESS_162441] be recorded as 1 of the following: 
Mild:  No limitation of usual activities  
Moderate:  Some limitation of usual activities  
Severe:  Inability to carry out usual activities  
For severity grading of local tolerability (injection site erythema, induration, ecchymosis, and 
pain), refer to Section  7.9. 
7.1.4. Relationship of an Adverse Event to the Investigational Medicinal Product  
The relationship of an adverse event to the IMP is characterized as descri bed in Table 4.

Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 01  Study TV48125- CNS -[ZIP_CODE] 
 81 
Protocol Version 2 with Amendment 01, 23 October 2017 Table 4: The Relationship of an Adverse Event to the IMP  
Term  Definition  Clarification 
No reasonable 
possibility  
(not related)  This category applies to adverse events that, after careful 
consideration, are clearly due to 
extraneous causes (disease, environment, etc) or to adverse events that, after careful medical consideration at the time they are evaluated, are judged to be unrelated 
to the Investigational Med icinal 
Product (IMP).  The relationship of an adverse event may be considered 
“no reasonable possibility” if it is clearly due to extraneous causes or if at least 2 of the following apply:  
• It does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from the administr ation of the IMP.  
• It could readily have been produced by [CONTACT_102]’s clinical state, environmental or toxic factors, or other modes of therapy administered to the patient.  
• It does not follow a known pattern of response to the 
IMP.  
• It does not reappear or  worsen when the IMP is 
re-administered.  
Reasonable 
possibility  
(related)  This category applies to adverse events for which, after careful medical consideration at the time 
they are evaluated, a connection with 
the administration of IMP cannot be ruled ou t with certainty.  The relationship of an adverse event may be considered “reasonable possibility” if at least 2 of the following apply:  
• It follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the IMP.  
• It cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_142916]’s clinical state, environmental or toxic factors, or other modes of therapy administered to the patient.  
• It disappears or decreases on cessation or reduction in 
dose. There are important exceptions when an 
adverse event does  not disappear after 
discontinuation of the IMP, yet an IMP relationship 
clearly exists.  
• It follows a known pattern of response to the IMP.  
7.1.5. Serious Adverse Events  
For recording of serious adverse event, the study period is defined for each patient as that time 
period from signature [CONTACT_28514]-up period. Serious 
adverse events occurring in a patient after the end of the follow-up period should be reported to 
the sponsor if the investigator becomes aware of them, following the procedures described in Section  [IP_ADDRESS].1. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Definition of a Serious Adverse Event  
A serious adverse event is an adverse event occurring at any dose that results in any of the following outcomes or actions: 
• results in death  
• is life -threatening adverse event (ie, the patient was at risk o f death at the time of the 
event); it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe  
 Placebo -Controlled Study– Migraine  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 01  Study TV48125- CNS -[ZIP_CODE] 
 82 
Protocol Version 2 with Amendment 01, 23 October 2017 • requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], which 
means that hospi[INVESTIGATOR_23455], or that they occurred as a consequence of the event  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_142883], unless there was worsening of the preexisting condition during the patient’s participation in this study.  
• results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (refers to a substantial disruption of one’s ability to conduct normal life functions)  
• is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• an important medical event that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but may jeopardize the patient and may require medical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in t his definition  
Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for 
allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. Note: Any suspected transmission of an infectious agent via a medicinal product is considered an important medical event. 
All occurrences of possible drug- induced liver injury that meet Hy’s law criteria, defined as all  
of the below, must be reported by [CONTACT_16971] a serious adverse event: 
• alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) increase of >3x the upper limit of normal (ULN)  
• total bilirubin increase of >2x ULN  
• absence of initial findings of cholestasis (ie, no substa ntial increase of alkaline 
phosphatase [ALP]) 
• no other explanation for the observed abnormalities 
An adverse event that does not meet any of the criteria for seriousness listed above will be regarded as a nonserious adverse event.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Expectedness  
A serious ad verse event that is not included in the Adverse Reaction section of the relevant 
reference safety information by [CONTACT_16972], severity, outcome, or frequency is considered an unexpected adverse event. The reference safety information for this study is the Investigator’s Brochure.  
The sponsor’s Global Patient Safety and Pharmacovigilance Department will determine the expectedness for all serious adverse events.  
For the purpose of S[LOCATION_003]R reporting, the version of the Investigator’s Brochure at the time of occurrence of the S[LOCATION_003]R applies.

Protocol Version 2 with Amendment 01, 23 October 2017 [IP_ADDRESS]. Reporting a Serious Adverse Event  
[IP_ADDRESS].1. Investigator Responsibility 
To satisfy regulatory requirements, a ll serious adverse events that occur during the study, 
regardless of judged relationship to administration of the IMP, must be reported to the sponsor 
by [CONTACT_093]. The event must be reported within [ADDRESS_162442] administration of IMP of that patient 
has ended should be reported to the spons or if the investigator becomes aware of them . 
The serious adverse event form should be sent to the local safety officer (LSO) or designee (a contract research organization (CRO) in a country without a sponsor LSO) (contact 
[CONTACT_127642]); the LSO will forward the report to the sponsor’s Global Patient Safety and Pharmacovigilance Department. 
The following information should be provided to record the event accurately and completely: 
• study number 
• investigator and investigational center  identification  
• patient number 
• onset date and detailed description of adverse event 
• investigator’s assessment of the relationship of the adverse event to the IMP 
(no reasonable possibility, reasonable possibility) 
Additional information includes: 
• age and gender of patient 
• date of first dose of IMP  
• date and amount of last administered dose of IMP 
• action taken  
• outcome, if known 
• severity  
• explanation of assessment of relatedness  
• concomitant medication (including doses, routes of administration, and regimens) and treatment of the event  
• pertinent laboratory or other diagnostic test data 
• medical history  
• results of dechallenge/rechallenge, if known

− cause of death (whether or not the death w as related to IMP)  
− autopsy findings (if available) 
Each report of a serious adverse event will be reviewed and evaluated by [CONTACT_142917], study procedures, and to underlying disease. 
Additional information (follow-up) about any serious adverse event unavailable at the initial 
reporting should be forwarded by [CONTACT_19452] 24 hours of when it becomes known to the same address as the initial report.  
For all countries, the sponsor’s Global Patient Safety and Pharmacovigilance Department will 
distribute the Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences form/extensible markup language (XML) file to the LSO and/or CRO for submission to the regulatory 
authorities, IEC/IRBs, and investigators, according to regulations. The investigator is responsible 
for ensuring that the IEC/IRB is also informed of the event, in accordance with national and local regulations. 
Blinding will be maintained for people who are involved directly in the study. Therefore, in case 
of a S[LOCATION_003]R, only the LSO or CRO will receive the unblinded report for regulatory submission; the others will receive a blinded report. 
Note: Although pregnancy is not a serious adverse event, the process for reporting a pregnancy is 
the same as that for reporting a serious adverse event, but using the pregnancy form (see Section  7.2).  
[IP_ADDRESS].2. Sponsor Responsibility  
If a serious unexpected adverse event is believed to be related to the IMP or study procedures, the sponsor will take appropriate steps to notify all investigators participating in sponsored 
clinical studies of fremanezumab and the appropriate competent authorities (and IEC/IRB, as 
appropriate). 
In addition to notifying the investigators and competent authorities (and IEC/IRB, as 
appropriate), other action may be required, including the following: 
• altering existing research by  [CONTACT_23504] 
• discontinuing or suspending the study 
• modifying the existing consent form and informing all study participants of new findings 
• modifying listings of expected toxicities to include adverse events newly identified as related to fremanezumab  
7.1.6. Protocol -Defined Adverse Events not for Expedited Reporting  
Not applicable.  
 Placebo -Controlled Study– Migraine  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment [ADDRESS_162443] to be sent to the sponsor’s Global Patient Safety and 
Pharmacovigilance Department for evaluation:  
• ophthalmic related adverse events of at least moderate severity,  
• events of possible drug- induced liver injury (AST or ALT ≥3 × the ULN, total 
bilirubin ≥2 × the ULN, or INR >1.5), Hy’s Law events, or  
• events of anaphylaxis and severe hypersensitivity reactions.  
For guidance regarding monitoring of patients with elevated liver function tests, refer to 
Appendix R . Anaphylaxis  and severe hypersensitivity will be monitored using the diagnostic 
criteria for anaphylaxis as outlined by [CONTACT_941] 2006 Joint National Institute of Allergy and I nfectious 
Disease/Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network  Second Symposium on Anaphylaxis 
(Sampson et al 2006) (also see Appendix S ). In the event of suspected anaphylaxis and severe 
hypersensitivity, vital signs, including oxygen saturation and respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487], will be measured. 
Other assessments will be performed at the discretion of the investigator. As a precaution, each site should have a resuscitation cart nearby.  
The process for reporting a protocol- defined adverse event of special interest is the same as that 
for reporting a serious adverse event (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS]). These events to be reported to the 
Global Patient Safety & Pharmacovigilance Department can be either serious or nonserious, according to the criteria outlined in Section  [IP_ADDRESS].  
7.1.8. Protocol Deviations Because of an Adverse Event  
If a patient experiences an adverse event or medical emergency, deviations from the protocol 
may be allowed on a case- by-case basis. To ensure patient safety, after the event has stabilized or 
treatment has  been administered (or both), the investigator or other physician in attendance must 
contact [CONTACT_23505]. The investigator, in consultation with 
the sponsor, will decide whether the patient should continue to participate in the study. 
7.2. Pregnancy  
Any female subject becoming pregnant during the study will discontinue IMP. All pregnancies 
of women participating in the study and female partners of men participating in the study, that 
occur during the study, or within 6.[ADDRESS_162444] provide the sponsor (LSO/CRO) 
with the completed pregnancy form. The process for reporting a pregnancy is the same as that for 
reporting a serious adverse event but using the pregnancy form (Section [IP_ADDRESS]). The investigator is not required to report female subjects who are found to be pregnant between screening and baseline, provided no protocol- related procedures were applied.  
All female subjects or female partners of men participating in the stu dy who become pregnant 
will be monitored for the outcome of the pregnancy (including spontaneous, elective, or 
 Placebo -Controlled Study– Migraine  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 01  Study TV48125- CNS -[ZIP_CODE] 
 86 
Protocol Version 2 with Amendment 01, 23 October 2017 voluntary abortion). Female partners of men participating in the study who become pregnant will 
be asked to sign an Informed Consent Form (ICF). If the pregnancy continues to term, the 
outcome (health of the infant up to 8 weeks of age), including details of birth and presence or absence of any birth defect, congenital abnormalities, or maternal and newborn complications, 
will be reported to the sponsor. Any complication of pregnancy during the study and any 
complication of pregnancy that the investigator becomes aware of after withdrawal from the study will be reported as an adverse event or serious adverse event, as appropriate.  
If the pregnancy in the woman participating in the study and/or the female partners of men participating in the study does not continue to term, 1 of the following actions will be taken: 
• For a spontaneous abortion, report as a serious adverse event. 
• For an elective abortion  due to developmental anomalies, report as a serious adverse 
event.  
• For an elective abortion not due to developmental anomalies, report on the pregnancy form; do not report as an adverse event. 
7.3. Medication Error and Special Situations Related to the 
Investi gational Medicinal Products  
Any administration of IMP that is not in accordance with the study protocol should be reported 
as an important deviation, if it meets the important deviation criteria specified in the protocol 
(Appendix C ), it or as a deviation, in the patient’s source documents, regardless of whether or 
not an adverse event occurs as a result. When meeting important protocol deviation criteria, all 
instances of incorrect IMP administration should be c ategorized in clinical trial management 
system.  
The following are types of medication errors and special situations: 
1. Medication error: Any unintentional error in the prescribing, dispensing, or 
administration of a medicinal product while in the control of the healthcare professional, patient, or consumer. 
2. Overdose: Administration of a quantity of a medicinal product given per administration or cumulatively which is above the maximum recommended dose according to the authorized product information. Clinical judgment should always be applied. Any dose of 
IMP (whether the test IMP or placebo IMP), whether taken intentionally or 
unintentionally, in excess of that prescribed must be immediately reported to the sponsor. When the identification of the IMP is required, the investigator must follow the procedures for unblinding outlined in Section 5.9.2.  
3. Misuse: Situations where the IMP is intentionally and inappropriately used not in accordance with the authorized product information. 
4. Abuse: Persistent or sporadic, intentional excessive use of IMP which is accompanied by [CONTACT_142918].  
5. Off-label use: Situations where an IMP is intentionally used for a medical purpose not in accordance with the authorized product information.

 87 
Protocol Version 2 with Amendment 01, 23 October 2017 6. Occupational exposure: Exposure to an IMP, as a result of one’s professional or non-
professional occupation. 
7. Breastfeeding: Suspected adverse reactions which occur in infants following exposure to a medicinal product from breast milk. 
7.4. Clinical Laboratory Tests  
All clinical laboratory test results outside of the reference range will be judged by [CONTACT_142919]: 
• abnormal and not clinically significant 
• abnormal and clinically significant  
A laboratory test result that is judged by [CONTACT_142920], and monitored as described in 
Section  7.1.2. An event may include a laboratory or diagnostic test abnormality (once confirmed 
by [CONTACT_28452]) that results in the withdrawal of the patient from the study, the temporary or 
permanent withdrawal of IMP or medical treatment, or further diagnostic work-up. Note: 
abnormal laboratory or diagnostic test results at the screening visit that preclude a patient from 
entering the study or receiving IMP are not considered adverse events.  
In addition, potentially clinically significant values will be pr edefined by [CONTACT_65963].  
Clinical laboratory tests (serum chemistry, hematology, coagulation, and urinalysis) will be performed at the time points detailed in Table 2. Clinical laboratory tests will be performed using 
the central laboratory. However, in case of abnormal coagulation during screening (run-in 
period), a local retest can be authorized by [CONTACT_142921] a case- by-case basis. Specific 
laboratory tests to be performed are provided in Appendix T . 
7.4.1. Other Clinical Laboratory Tests  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Human Chorionic Gonadotropin Test 
Serum β -HCG tests and urine β -HCG tests will be performed for all women of childbearing 
potential at time points described in Table 2. Any patient who becomes pregnant during the study will be withdrawn. Procedures for reporting the pregnancy are provided in Section  7.2. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Follicle -Stimulating Hormone Test 
Postmenopausal women will have a follicle- stimulating hormone (FSH) test at screening 
(see Table 2).  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Saliva Collection 
Saliva samples (~ 1 mL) will be collected using a standardized protocol available in the 
laboratory manual at time points described in Table 2. Care should be taken to freeze at -70°C 
(or at/below -20°C if no - 70°C freezer available) the properly collected saliva samples as soon as 
possible (3- 5 minutes) after collection from the patient. For additional details see Appendix M .

 88 
Protocol Version 2 with Amendment 01, 23 October 2017 7.5. Physical Examinations  
Physical examinations, including height (to be obtained at the screening visit only) and weight, 
will be performed at the time points detailed in Table 2. A complete physical examination will 
include the following organ sy stems: general appearance; head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat; chest 
and lungs; heart; abdomen; musculoskeletal; skin; lymph nodes; and neurological. Any  physical 
examination finding that is judged by [CONTACT_142922] (except at the screening visit) will be considered an adverse event, recorded on the CRF, and monitored as described in Section  7.1.2. 
7.6. Vital Signs 
Vital signs (pulse, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, oral temperature, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_697]) 
will be measured at the time points detailed in Table 2. All vital signs results outside of the 
reference ranges will be judged by [CONTACT_142919]:  
• abnormal and not clinically significant 
• abnormal and clinically significant  
Before pulse and blood pressure are measured, the patient must be in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_47342] -erect/seated position and resting for at least 5 minutes. The same position and arm should 
be used each time vital signs are measured for a given patient. For any abnormal vital sign 
finding, the measurement should be repeated as soon as poss ible. Any vital sign value that is 
judged by [CONTACT_1694] a clinically significant change (worsening) from a baseline value will be considered an adverse event, recorded on the source documentation and transcribed onto the CRF, and monitored as described in Section 7.1.2.  
7.7. Electrocardiography  
Twelve-lead ECGs will be conducted before other assessments (eg, blood draws and administration of questionnaires) at the time points detailed in Table 2. The ECGs should be performed a fter the patient has been supi[INVESTIGATOR_1919] 5 minutes. The ECGs will be performed 
in triplicate, with approximately 1 to 5 minutes between recordings.  
A qualified physician at a central diagnostic center will be responsible for interpreting the ECG. Electrocardiograms should be performed and transmitted according to the central ECG reading 
instructions provided in the ECG user manual. Electrocardiogram equipment will be provided to all clinical sites.  
Although the ECG interpretation will be performed centrally, the clinical evaluation remains the 
investigator’s responsibility.  
The ECG will be evaluated by [CONTACT_65966] (signed and dated), and the printout should be kept in the source documentation file. When potentially clinic ally 
significant findings are detected by [CONTACT_093], a cardiologist should be consulted for a definitive interpretation. All communications and diagnoses should be filed in the source documentation file. The investigator’s interpretation will be rec orded in the CRF regardless of 
the central reading interpretation. Any abnormal findings assessed by [CONTACT_142923] -Controlled Study– Migraine  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 01  Study TV48125- CNS -[ZIP_CODE] 
 89 
Protocol Version 2 with Amendment 01, 23 October 2017 clinically significant should be recorded in the relevant CRF modules (eg, adverse event, medical 
history). 
Objective alerts are predefined as described in the central ECG reading manual. In these cases, 
the site and the sponsor will be informed immediately.  
Any unscheduled ECGs must also be submitted for central ECG reading. 
All ECG results outside of the reference ranges will be judged  by [CONTACT_142924]: 
• abnormal and not clinically significant  
• abnormal and clinically significant  
Any ECG finding that is judged by [CONTACT_1694] a potentially clinically significant change 
(worsening) compared with a baseline value will be considered an adverse event, recorded on the 
source documentation and in the CRF, and monitored as described in  Section 7.1.2. 
7.8. Immunogenicity  
Blood samples for serum ADA assessment will be collected at the time points detailed in 
Table 2. Only the samples from fremanezumab -treated patients will be analyzed for ADAs. 
Blood samples for ADA assessment will also be collected upon observation of any severe 
hypersensitivity reaction and anaphylaxis. Bioanalytical personnel should be made aware of anaphylaxis occurrence as soon as possible in case an anti -fremanezumab IgE assay is needed.  
Clinical criteria for  diagnosing anaphylaxis are detailed in Appendix S . 
7.9. Assessment of Local Tolerability and Pain  
Spontaneous reports of injection site reactions will be recorded as AEs according to the following severity assessment criteria  
• Spontaneous reports of injection-site erythema, induration, and ecchymos is will be 
recorded according to measurements: 5  to ≤50 mm (mild), >50 to ≤100 mm 
(moderate), and >100 mm (severe).  
• Spontaneous report of local pain after the injection will be recorded as mild, moderate or severe according to patient’s self -report.  
• Appropriate treatment may be provided if necessary, in which case it must be recorded as concomitant medication.  
7.10. Assessment of Suicidality  
The study population being administered fremanezumab should be monitored appropriately and 
observed closely for suicidal ideation and behavior or any other unusual changes in behavior. 
Consideration should be given to discontinuing fremanezumab  in participants who experience 
signs of suicidal ideation or behavior without relevant medical history. 
Families and caregivers of participants being treated with fremanezumab  should be instructed to 
monitor participants for the emergence of unusual changes in behavior, as well as the emergence

Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 01  Study TV48125- CNS -[ZIP_CODE] 
 90 
Protocol Version 2 with Amendment 01, 23 October 2017 of suicidal ideation and behavior, and to report such symptoms immediately to the study 
inves tigator.  
The eC -SSRS will be used to assess the patient’s suicidal ideation (severity and intensity) and 
behavior ( Posner et al 2011). The time points when the eC- SSRS Baseline/Screening version and 
the eC -SSRS Since Last Vis it version will be completed are detailed in Table 2. Any positive 
findings on the eC- SSRS Since Last Visit version requires evaluation by a physician or doctoral -
level psychologist. 
A positive finding will be defin ed as a current suicide ideation with some intent to act and no 
plan. The investigator, based on his/her medical judgment, will determine if the patient should be 
seen by a mental health specialist and if he/she should continue participating in the study. If a 
patient reports current suicide ideation with specific plan and intent, then the patient should be immediately discontinued from the study and seen by a mental health specialist.  
Any patient should be excluded if any suicidal behaviors are reported. 
Any patient with lifetime suicidal behaviors (actual, interrupted, and aborted attempts and 
preparatory actions) should be excluded and/or discontinued from the study. 
7.11. Concomitant Therapy or Medication  
Concomitant therapy or medication use will be monitore d throughout the study. Details of 
prohibited medications are found in Section 5.6.

PHARMACOGENOMICS/IMMUNOGENICITY  
8.1. Pharmacokinetic Assessment  
Sampling for pharmacokinetics will be sparse. Thus, t he fremanezumab pharmacokinetics 
samples may be analyzed using a population pharmacokinetics approach and if performed, this 
analysis will be reported separately to the clinical study report.  
Blood samples (approximately 4 mL) for plasma concentration measurements of fremanezumab 
will be collected via venipuncture/indwelling catheter at time points detailed in Table 2. Samples 
from patients who receive active IMP will be analyzed for concentration of fremanezumab using 
a validated method. Samples from patients who were randomized to receive placebo will not be analyzed (at the double-blind period only). Details on sample handling, storage, shipment, and analysis are given in Appendix K .  
8.2. Pharmacodynamics Assessment  
Pharmacodynamic parameters are not evaluated in this study.  
8.3. Immunogenicity Testing  
Blood samples (5 mL) f or immunogenicity testing will be collected via venipuncture or 
indwelling catheter at the time points detailed in Table 2.  
Samples from patients who receive fremanezumab will be analyzed for ADA using a validated 
method. Samples from patients who receive placebo will not be analyzed. 
Details on sample handling, storage, shipment, and analysis are provided in Appendix L . 
8.4. Assessment of Exploratory Biomarkers 
Biomarkers are defined as biological substances that monitor physiological effects, assess drug 
activity, and predict clinical outcome, safety, and response to therapy. Details on sample 
handling, storage, shipment, and analysis are provided in Appendix M .  
Based on the known biology of CGRP’s mechanism of action, biomarker assessment will 
potentially include measurement of CGRP and other potential mediators involved in migraine, as 
well as markers of bone remodeling, inflammation, and angiogenesis. Exploratory multiplex immunoassay panels will be applied to measure baseline levels and changes in proteins in 
various biofluids which may include urine, serum, plasma, and/or saliva. Whole blood RNA (via 
Paxgene tubes) will also be collected for future analysis.  
The planned biomarker analysis will be detailed in a separate document, which may be updated at a later stage prior to the analysis to allow updating with new scientific information.

Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment [ADDRESS_162445] been identified as having roles in migraine and/or 
headache onset ( Anttila et al 2013 ). To explore the potential impact of normal variations in these 
loci on parameters in this study, a blood sample (6 mL) will be collected from each patient (unless the patient declines testing or local regulations prohibit testing) for pharmacogenomic assessment during this study. Pharmacogenomic assessment potentially includes the association analysis of both known and unknown DNA and RNA genetic variations.

an open- label period to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of mont hly and quarterly sc 
fremanezumab compared with placebo in patients with CM and EM with inadequate response to 
prior preventive treatments.  Eligible patients will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive a 
monthly dose of TEV-[ZIP_CODE], quarterly dose of TEV-[ZIP_CODE] at 675 mg followed by [CONTACT_142925], or monthly placebo. Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_547], country, migraine classification (CM or EM), and special group of treatment failure (yes, no). 
9.1. Sample Size and Power Considerations  
In the Phase 2b  study for CM (study LBR -101- 021), the treatment difference between 
675/225/225 mg and placebo in change from baseline in monthly average migraine days was 2.1 days (SD=5.2 days). In the phase 2b study for EM (study LBR-101-022), the treatment 
difference b etween 225 mg monthly dose and placebo in change from baseline in monthly 
average migraine days was 2.7 days (SD=4.1 days). In the Phase 3 study for CM ( Study 
TV48125- CNS -[ZIP_CODE]), the treatment differences to placebo in change from baseline in monthly 
avera ge migraine days were 1.7 days and 1.8 days for the quarterly dose and the monthly dose, 
respectively (SD=5.4 days). In the Phase 3 study for EM ( Study TV48125- CNS -[ZIP_CODE]), the 
treatment differences to placebo in change from baseline in monthly average migraine days were 1.3 days and 1.5 days for the quarterly dose and the monthly dose, respectively (SD=3.4 days). 
Combining the information above, a treatment difference of 1.8 days is used. Considering the 
patient population is different from the previous studies, a SD of 6 days is used to account for the complexity and uncertainty of this study. 
A sample size of 705 (235 patients per treatment group) evaluable patients completing the study 
is needed for 90% power to show a 1.8 difference in migraine days (assuming a common standard deviation [SD] of 6 days) at an alpha level of 0.05. Assuming a 12% discontinuation rate, 268 patients per treatment group will be randomized in the study. 
9.2. Analysis Sets 
9.2.1. Intent -to-Treat Analysis Set 
The intent- to-treat (ITT) analysi s set will include all randomized patients.  
In the ITT analysis set, treatment will be assigned based on the treatment to which patients were randomized, regardless of which treatment they actually received. 
9.2.2. Modified Intent -to-Treat Analysis Set 
The modified intent- to-treat (mITT) analysis set is a subset of the ITT analysis set including only 
patients who receive at least [ADDRESS_162446] baseline 
efficacy assessment on the primary endpoint. 
 Placebo -Controlled Study– Migraine  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment [ADDRESS_162447] 1 dose of IMP.  
In the safety analysis set, treatment will be assigned based on the treatment patients actually 
received, regardless of the treatment to which they were randomized, unless otherwise specified.  
9.2.4. Per-Protocol Analysis Set 
The per -protocol (PP) analysis set is a subset of the mITT analysis set including only patients 
who complete the study without important protocol deviations or any deviations/omissions of the study drug administration . 
In the PP analysis set, treatment will be assigned based on the treatment patients actually received, regardless of the treatment to which they were randomized.  
9.3. Data Handling Conventions  
Efficacy variables from patients who do not have diar y entries completed for the entire study 
period will be imputed. The monthly average number of headache days/hours will be calculated 
based on the observed data prorated to a 28-day rate for those patients who had at least [ADDRESS_162448] 10 days of diary data should provide a 
reasonable estimate of patient’s disease status in the study while only excluding limited number 
of patients from efficacy analysis (those who had less than 10 days of diary data) to m inimize 
potential bias. In calculation of a patient’s monthly number of days/hours of efficacy variables 
during the 4-week period after each dose of study drug for months 1, 2, and 3, the following method will be used to handle the missing data: 
• If a patient ha d ≥10 days of e -diary data for a month, the monthly number of 
days/hours of efficacy variables will be prorated to 28 days for that month. 
• If a patient had <10 days of e -diary data for a month, the monthly number of 
days/hours of efficacy variables will be considered as missing. 
Detailed missing data imputation rules for the headache diary data will be described in the statistical analysis plan.  
9.4. Study Population  
The ITT analysis set (Section  9.2.1) will be used for all study population summaries unless 
otherwise specified. Summaries will be presented by [CONTACT_11364].  
Summaries will be presented by [CONTACT_11364].  
9.4.1. Patient Disposition  
Data from patients screened, patient s screened but not randomized and reason for not 
randomized, patients who are randomized, patients randomized but not treated, patients in the ITT, mITT, safety, and per-protocol analysis sets, patients who complete the study, and patients 
who withdraw from the study  will be summarized using descriptive statistics. Data from patients

variables, descriptive statistics (number [n], mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and 
maximum) will be provided. For categorical variables, patient counts and percentages will be provided. Categories for missing data will be presented if necessary. 
Treatment groups will be compared for all continuous variables, using an analysis of varia nce 
(ANOVA) with treatment group as factors. The categorical variables of patient gender and race 
will be summarized using descriptive statistics for each variable category. Missing categories 
will be presented if necessary. Treatment groups will be compared for all categorical variables 
using a Pearson’s chi- square (or Fisher’s exact test if cell sizes are too small).

9.5.4. Planned Method of Analysis  
The mITT analysis set (Section  9.2.2)  will be used for all efficacy analyses. Summaries will be 
presented by [CONTACT_1570]. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Primary Efficacy Analysis 
The primary efficacy endpoint will be analyzed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) 
method. The model will include treatment, gender, region, special group of treatment failure 
(Yes or No),  migraine classification (ie, CM or EM), and treatment -by-migraine classification 
interaction as fixed effects, and baseline number of migraine days and years since onset of 
migraines as covariates. The treatment comparison between each fremanezumab treatment group 
(monthly dose and quarterly dose) and placebo for monthly average migraine days will be conducted under this model using the estimate statement. Ninety- five percent confidence 
intervals  will be constructed for the least squares means differences between each fremanezumab 
treatment group (monthly dose and quarterly dose) and placebo. 
Note: Special treatment failure group defined as patients who must have had inadequate response 
to valproi c acid.  In addition, patients in the special treatment failure group must have had 
inadequate response to 2 to 3 other classes  of migraine preventive medications as defined 
in Appendix H . 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Sensitivity Analysis  
Sensitivity analysis will be performed by [CONTACT_142907] 1-[ADDRESS_162464] squares means differences between each fremanezumab treatment groups (monthly dose and quarterly dose) and placebo will be

Protocol Version 2 with Amendment 01, 23 October 2017 constructed. The detailed SAS cod e for imputation and analysis procedure will be provided in 
the statistical analysis plan. This sensitivity analysis will be performed on the ITT analysis  set. 
Sensitivity analysis will also be performed using a mixed -effects repeated measures (MMRM) 
analy sis model. If a patient is early terminated or has intermittent missing days and has fewer 
than 10 days of e-diary entries for a month, that month’s value will be considered as missing. 
The MMRM model will include  treatment, gender, region, special group of treatment failure (Yes or No), migraine classification (ie, CM or EM),  month, treatment- by-migraine 
classification interaction, and treatment- by-month interaction as fixed effects, baseline value and 
years since onset of migraines as covariates, and patient in the repeated statement as a random effect. The treatment comparison between each fremanezumab treatment group (monthly dose 
and quarterly dose) and placebo for monthly average migraine days will be conducted under this 
model using the estimate statement. Ninety -five percent confidence intervals will be constructed 
for the least squares means differences between each fremanezumab treatment group (monthly 
dose and quarterly dose) and placebo. This sensitivity analysis will be performed on the mITT 
analysis set.  
Note: Special treatment failure group defined as patients who must have had inadequate response 
to valproic acid. In addition, patients in the special treatment failure group must have had 
inadequate response to 2 to 3 other classes  of migraine preventive medications as defined 
in Appendix H . 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Secondary Efficacy Analysis 
The continuous secondary efficacy endpoints will be analyzed similarly as the primary efficacy 
endpoint. For the proportion of responders, defined as 50% or more reduction from baseline in the monthly average numbe r of migraine days, a logistic regression model will be used with the 
following effects: treatment, gender, region, special group of treatment failure (Yes or No), and migraine classification (ie, CM or EM). The odds ratios, 95% confidence intervals for od ds 
ratios , and p-values will be presented for each fremanezumab treatment group (monthly dose and 
quarterly dose).  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Exploratory Efficacy Analysis 
For the double-blind period, the continuous exploratory efficacy endpoints period will be 
analyzed similarly as the primary efficacy endpoint. For the proportions of responders for the 
double-blind period, a logistic regression model will be used similarly as the secondary efficacy 
endpoint.  
For the open-label period, the exploratory efficacy endpoints will be summarized using 
descriptive statistics.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Subgroup Analysis  
The ANCOVA analysis defined in Section  [IP_ADDRESS] and MMRM analysis defined in 
Section  [IP_ADDRESS] will also be applied for the following subgroups for the primary endpoint. 
• age group (18- 45 years, >45 years)  
• sex (male, female)

• migraine classification (CM, EM)  
An exploratory analysis for the primary endpoint will also be performed by [CONTACT_142928] -by-region interaction to  the primary  analysis model  to test whether treatment effects 
are homogenous across regions. 
9.6. Multip le Comparisons and Multiplicity  
The Hochberg’s method along with hierarchical testing procedure for multiple comparisons between treatment groups (2 comparisons: fremanezumab monthly dose compared with placebo 
and fremanezumab quarterly dose compared with placebo) for the primary and secondary 
endpoint analyses will be used to maintain the experiment- wise type I error of 5%.  
In the primary analysis, according to the Hochberg’s method, if the null hypothesis is rejected for 
both the fremanezumab monthly and quarterly treatment groups at an alpha level of 5%, then no 
adjustment to the alpha level will be performed and both comparisons will be declared as statistically significant. The secondary variables will then be tested in the order as specified in 
Section  9.5.2 for both the fremanezumab monthly and quarterly treatment groups using the same 
procedure as the primary analysis. If the null hypothesis is not rejected for 1 of the doses at an 
alpha level of 5%, then the other dose will be tested using an alpha level of 5%/2=2.5%, and the sequential testing will stop.  
No multiplicity adjustments will be made for exploratory efficacy analyses.  
9.7. Safety Analysis 
Safety analyses will be performed on the safety analysis set (Section  9.2.3). 
Safety assessments and time points are provided in Table 2. All adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA). Each patient will be counted only once in each preferred term or system organ class (SOC) category for the analyses of safety. Summaries will be presented for all adverse events 
(overall and by [CONTACT_926]), adverse events determined by [CONTACT_16945] 
(i.e., reasonable possibility) (defined as related or with missing relationship) (overall and by [CONTACT_926]), serious adverse events, and adverse events causing withdrawal from the study.  
Summaries will be presented by [CONTACT_11364]. Patient listings of seriou s 
adverse events and adverse events leading to withdrawal will be presented.  
Changes in laboratory, ECG, and vital signs measurements data will be summarized descriptively. All values will be compared with predefined criteria to identify potentially 
clinic ally significant values or changes, and such values will be listed.  
Safety data will be summarized descriptively overall and by [CONTACT_1570]. For continuous 
variables, descriptive statistics (n, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum) 
will be provided for actual values and changes from baseline to each time point. For categorical 
variables, patient counts and percentages will be provided. The denominator for categorical 
variables will exclude missing observations. Descriptive summaries of  serious adverse events,

Protocol Version 2 with Amendment 01, 23 October 2017 patient withdrawals due to adverse events, and potentially clinically significant abnormal values 
(clinical laboratory or vital signs) based on predefined criteria will be provided as well. 
If any patient dies during the study, a listing of deaths will be provided and all relevant 
information will be discussed in the patient narrative included in the clinical study report.  
9.8. Tolerability Analysis 
Local tolerability findings will be listed and summarized descriptively.  
9.9. Pharmacokinetic  Analysis 
Pharmacokinetic plasma concentration results for fremanezumab will be tabulated descriptively at each planned sampling time point by [CONTACT_142929]. 
In addition, the most appropriate population pharmacokinetic model may be develope d, and 
covariates that may affect it will be tested for inclusion in the model. If performed, this analysis 
will be reported separately.  
9.10. Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Analysis  
The pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship may be estimated by [CONTACT_65973]. The pharmacokinetic parameters will be based on IMP measurements. The 
pharmacodynamics analysis will be the efficacy response(s).  
The pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship may be estimated using the most 
appropriate model after comparing different candidate models for their quality of fit. Covariates 
that may affect the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship will be tested for inclusion in the model. If performed, this analysis will be reported separately. 
9.11. Exploratory Biomarke r Analysis 
Exploratory biomarker measurements will be made using appropriately validated assays. Results, 
if generated, will typi[INVESTIGATOR_142872] % change from baseline and reported in a separate 
report.  
9.12. Pharmacogenomic Analysis  
Pharmacogenomic analys is will be conducted to correlate clinical observations 
(pharmacokinetics, safety, efficacy, or other effects) with genotypes observed in the study. Pharmacogenomic analysis may be conducted at a later time and will be reported in a separate report.  
9.13. Immuno genicity Analysis 
Summary of immunogenicity results will be provided, and the incidence of immunogenicity will 
be calculated. The impact of immunogenicity on the pharmacokinetic profile, drug efficacy, and 
clinical safety will be evaluated if data allowed.  This analysis will be reported separately.

Protocol Version 2 with Amendment 01, 23 October 2017 APPENDIX C. QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE  
Protocol Amendm ents and Protocol Deviations  
Protocol Amendments  
No changes from the final approved (signed) protocol will be initiated without the prior written 
approval or favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_1101] a written amendment by [CONTACT_6179]/IRB and national and local 
competent authoriti es, as applicable, except when necessary to address immediate safety 
concerns to the patients or when the change involves only nonsubstantial logistics or 
administration. The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_16932], the coordinating investiga tor (if applicable), and the sponsor will sign the protocol amendment. 
Important Deviations 
Any deviation from the protocol that affects, to a significant degree, (a) the safety, physical, or 
mental integrity of the patients in the study and/or (b) the scientific value of the study will be 
considered a protocol deviation. Protocol deviations may include non- adherence on the part of 
the patient, the investigator, or the sponsor to protocol-specific inclusion and exclusion criteria, 
primary objective variable criteria, or GCP guidelines; noncompliance to IMP administration; 
use of prohibited medications. All protocol deviations will be reported to the responsible IEC/IRB, as required. 
When a protocol deviation  is reported, the sponsor will determine whether to withdraw the 
patient from the study or permit the patient to continue in the study, with documented approval 
from the medical expert. The decision will be based on ensuring the safety of the patient and preserving the integrity of the study. 
Waivers in th e inclusion and exclusion criteria of the protocol are not  prospectively granted by 
[CONTACT_456]. If investigational center personnel learn that a patient who did not meet protocol 
inclusion and exclusion criteria was entered in a study, they must immediately inform the 
sponsor of the protocol deviation . If such patient has already completed the study or has 
withdrawn early, no action will be taken but the deviation will be recorded.  
Information to Study Personnel  
The investigator is responsible for giving information about the study to all personnel members involved in the study or in any element of patient management, both before starting the study and 
during the course of the study (eg, when new personnel become involved). The investigator must 
ensure that  all study personnel are qualified by [CONTACT_8640], experience, and training to perform 
their specific task. These study personnel members must be listed on the investigational center 
authorization form, which includes a clear description of each personnel me mber’s 
responsibilities. This list must be updated throughout the study, as necessary. 
The study monitor is responsible for explaining the protocol to all study personnel, including the 
investigator, and for ensuring they comply with the protocol. 
 Placebo -Controlled Study– Migraine  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment [ADDRESS_162487] signed the informed consent form and the study is conducted according to applicable SOPs, the protocol, and other written instructions and regulatory guidelines. 
The study monitor is the primary association between the sponsor and the investigator. The main 
responsibilities of the study monitor(s) are to visit the investigator before, during, and after the 
study to ensure adherence to the protocol, that all data are correctly and completely recorded and 
reported, and that informed consent is obtained and recorded for all patients before they participate in the study and when changes to the consent form are warranted, in accord ance with 
IEC/IRB approvals. 
The study monitor(s) will contact [CONTACT_28505]. The study monitor will be permitted to review and verify the various 
records (CRFs and other pertinent source data records, including specific electronic source 
document relating to the study) to verify adherence to the protocol and to ensure the completeness, consistency, and accuracy of the data being recorded. 
As part of the supervision of study progress, other sponsor personnel may, on request, 
accompany  the study monitor on visits to the investigational center. The investigator and 
assisting personnel must agree to cooperate with the study monitor to resolve any problems, 
errors, or possible misunderstandings concerning the findings detected during the course of these 
monitoring visits or provided in follow- up written communication.  
Audit and Inspection  
The sponsor may audit the investigational center to evaluate study conduct and compliance with protocols, SOPs, GCP guidelines, and applicable regulatory requirements. The sponsor’s Global Clinical Quality Assurance, independent of Global Specialty Development, is responsible for determining the need for (and timing of) an investigational center audit. 
The i nvestigator must accept that competent authorities and sponsor representatives may conduct 
inspections and audits to verify compliance with GCP guidelines.

Protocol Version 2 with Amendment 01, 23 October 2017 APPENDIX D. ETHICS 
Informed Consent  
The investigator, or a qualified person designated by [CONTACT_093], should fully inform the 
patient of all pertinent aspects of the study, including the written information approved by [CONTACT_6179]/IRB. All written and oral information about the study will be provided in a language as 
nontechnical as practical to be understood by [CONTACT_102]. The patient should be given ample time 
and opportunity to inquire about details of the study and to decide whether or not to participate in the study. The above should be detailed in the source documents. 
Written informed consent will be obtain ed from each patient before any study specific 
procedures or assessments are done and after the aims, methods, anticipated benefits, and 
potential hazards are explained. The patient’s willingness to participate in the study will be 
documented in the informed consent form, which will be signed and personally dated by [CONTACT_142937]. The investigator will keep the original informed consent forms, and copi[INVESTIGATOR_11309]. It will also be 
explained to the patients that the patient is free to refuse participation in the study and free to 
withdraw from the study at any time without prejudice to future treatment.  
Adult patients with a legally acceptable representative should provide informed consent according to national and local requirements.  
Competent Authorities and Independent Ethics Committees/Institutional Review Boards  
Before this study starts, the protocol will be submitted to the national competent authority and to 
the respective IEC/IRB for review. As required, the study will not start at a given investigational 
center before the IEC/IRB and competent authority (as applicable) for the investigational center have given written approval or a favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649]. 
Confidentiality Regar ding Study Patients  
The investigator must ensure that the privacy of the patients, including their identity and all 
personal medical information, will be maintained at all times. In CRFs and other documents or 
image material submitted to the sponsor, patie nts will be identified not by [CONTACT_2249], but by [CONTACT_16995]. 
Personal medical information may be reviewed for the purpose of patient safety or for verifying 
data in the source and the CRF. This review may be conducted by [CONTACT_11200], properly 
authorized persons on behalf of the sponsor, Global Quality Assurance (GCA), or competent authorities. Personal medical information will always be treated as confidential.  
Registration of the Clinical Study  
In compliance with national and local regulations and in accordance with Teva standard procedures, this clinical study will be registered on trials registry websites.  
 Placebo -Controlled Study– Migraine  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment [ADDRESS_162488] 
(IMP) or concomitant medications and hormonal contraception should be conducted. Hormonal 
contraception may be susceptible to interaction with the IMP, which may reduce the efficacy of 
the contraception method. 
Drug interaction studies have not been conducted with fremanezumab. Like other therapeutic 
antibodies, fremanezumab is expected to be primarily metabolized via proteolytic catabolism. 
Therefore, interaction with and impact on drug metabolizing enzymes (eg, CYP isoforms) is considered unlikely in humans. 
In addition, fremanezumab is not expected to indirectly influence the CYP enzymes. In general, 
protein products that are cytokine modulators have been reported to affect the metabolism or disposition of co- administered medication by [CONTACT_142938]/transporters ( FDA 2012). 
Fremanezumab is an IgG2 isotype that is directed against a non-immunologic and soluble (not cell bound) target. Thus, the risk of cytokine release is considered to be low in the clinical settin g. Furthermore, fremanezumab was tested for stimulation of pro- inflammatory cytokine 
release in human whole blood (Study 111320). Fremanezumab did not elicit significant cytokine release (TNF -α, IL -6, INF -γ, or IL -1β) in any donor including at concentrations up to 
100 μg/mL. As such, there is no reason to suspect that fremanezumab may influence CYP activity.  
Women of non- childbearing potential are defined as:  
• Surgically (hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656]) or congenitally steri le 
• One year postmenopausal (stable amenorrhea for 12 months without alternative medical cause plus high follicle -stimulating hormone (FSH) in the postmenopausal 
range) in women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy 
• Women in stable post-menopause, but are taking hormone replacement therapy for the treatment of menopausal symptoms, may be considered eligible for the study even with the lower serum FSH. They do not need to use other contraception. 
Highly effective birth control metho ds: 
Highly effective birth control methods are methods that can achieve a failure rate of less than 1% per year when used consistently and correctly are considered. Such methods include the following: 
• Combined estrogen and progestogen hormonal contraception (oral, intravaginal, or transdermal) associated with inhibition of ovulation; these should be initiated at least [ADDRESS_162489] dose of IMP. 
 Placebo -Controlled Study– Migraine  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 01  Study TV48125- CNS -[ZIP_CODE] 
 130 
Protocol Version 2 with Amendment 01, 23 October 2017 • Progestogen -only hormonal contraception (oral, injectable, or implantable) associated 
with inhibition of ovulation; these should be initiated at least [ADDRESS_162490] 
dose of IMP. 
• Intrauterine device (IUD) and intrauterine hormone- releasing system (IUS) need to be 
in place at least 2 months before screening.  
• Bilateral tubal occlusion  
• vasectomized partner provided that he is the sole sexual partner and has received medical assessment of the surgical process.  
• Sexual abstinence is only considered a highly effective method if defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse in the defined period. The reliability of 
sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical study and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient.  
• Periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods), 
declaration  of abstinence for the duration of a study, and withdrawal are not 
acceptable  methods of contraception (according to Medicines and Healthcare 
Products Regulatory Agency). 
Acceptable birth control methods:  
Acceptable birth control methods that result in a failure rate of more than 1% per year include 
progestogen-only oral hormonal contraception for which the inhibition of ovulation is not the 
primary mode of action; male or female condom with or without spermicide; cap; diaphragm; or 
sponge with spermicide. The combinations of male condom with cap, diaphragm, or sponge with spermicide (double-barrier methods) are also considered acceptable but not highly effective methods of birth control. 
Unacceptable birth control methods:  
Periodic abstinence (calendar, sy mptothermal, or post-ovulation methods), withdrawal (coitus 
interruptus), spermicides only, and lactational amenorrhea method are not acceptable methods of 
contraception. Female condom and male condom should not be used together. 
Male contraception:  
Male s ubjects must always use a condom. 
Vasectomy:  
Use of contraceptive methods applies also to vasectomized men. Pregnant female partners of male study participants: 
Male study participants must use condoms during intercourse if their female partners are 
pregnant. 
 Placebo -Controlled Study– Migraine  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment [ADDRESS_162491] to follow -up if he/she repeatedly fails to return for scheduled 
visits and is unable to be contact[CONTACT_23524]. 
The following actions must be taken if a patient fails to return to the investigational center for a 
required study visit: 
• The investigational center must attempt to contact [CONTACT_142939]/or should continue in the study. 
• In cases in which the patient is deemed lost to follow-up, the investigator or designee must make every effort to regain contact [CONTACT_10970] (where possible, 3 tele phone 
calls and, if necessary, a certified letter to the patient’s last known mailing address or local equivalent methods). These contact [CONTACT_23526]’s medical record.  
• Should the patient continue to be unreachable, he/she will be considered to have withdrawn from the study with a primary reason of ‘lost to follow-up’. 
 Placebo -Controlled Study– Migraine  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment [ADDRESS_162492](S)  
Storage and Security  
The investigator or designee must confirm appropr iate temperature conditions have been 
maintained for all IMPs received and any discrepancies are reported and resolved before use of 
the IMPs.  
The IMPs (fremanezumab and placebo IMP must be stored refrigerated at 2°C to 8°C (36°F 
to 46°F) and protected from light. The sites should have a process for monitoring the drug 
storage temperature.  
Fremanezumab and placebo supplies must be kept in a secure area (eg, locked refrigerator) with 
access limited to the investigator and authorized staff at the investigatio nal center . 
Diversion is considered to have occurred when the legal supply chain of prescription analgesic medicinal products is broken, and medicinal products are transferred from a licit to an illicit channel of distribution or use. 
Labeling  
Supplies of IMPs will be labeled according to the current International Council for 
Harmonisation (ICH) guidelines on Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and Good Manufacturing 
Practice and will include any locally required statements. If necessary, labels will be translated into the local language.  
Accountability  
Each study drug shipment will include a packing slip listing the contents of the shipment, drug return instructions, and any applicable forms. 
Each investigator is responsible for ensuring that deliveries of study drug and other study 
materials from Teva are correctly received, recorded, handled, stored, accounted for, and used in accordance with this protocol. In addition, each investigator is responsible for ensuring that study 
drug and other materials from Teva are correctly, safely, and properly disposed of in accordance 
with local regulations.  
A record of study drug accountability (ie, study drug and other materials received, used, retained, returned, or destroyed) must be prepared and signed by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_1461], 
with an account given for any discrepancies.

Protocol Version 2 with Amendment 01, 23 October 2017 Appendix  K. PHARMACOKINETICS SAMPLES  
Specimen Sampling and Handling  
For plasma collection, samples will be collected in K2EDTA anticoagulant tubes, inverted 
slowly 6  to 8 times to mix the contents, and placed on water/ice (approximately 4°C). Blood 
samples will be centrifuged (1500g, approximately 10 minutes, at 2  to 8°C) between 5 minutes 
and 1 hour after sampling. If a refrigerated centrifuge is not available, samples should be chilled before centrifugation. Other measures sh ould be taken as appropriate to prevent samples from 
heating significantly during centrifugation. Separated plasma will be transferred in 
approximately equal portions in the 2 provided labeled 2-mL polypropylene tubes 
(Sets  A and  B). 
Labels for samples sho uld include study number, patient randomization number, nominal 
collection time (Visit number), Set A or B, and indication that they are pharmacokinetics samples. Samples will be stored at a temperature of -20°C in an upright position until they are shippe d to the central laboratory.  
Shipment and Analysis of Samples  
Plasma samples set A for all patients will be shipped from the investigational center to the central laboratory, where they will be stored until shipped to the sponsor or designee for analysis. 
Plasma samples set B for all patients will be shipped from the investigational center to the central 
laboratory once the set A samples are received at the central laboratory. Samples will be stored in an upright position at –70ºC (or at/below -20°C if no -70°C freezer available) until shipment 
to bioanalytical laboratory. The bioanalytical laboratory will be notified before the shipment of 
the samples and will be sent the shippi[INVESTIGATOR_142890]. An el ectronic file containing the sample manifest  will be emailed to the 
bioanalytical laboratory and the sponsor’s representatives from bioanalytical departments for each shipment.  
Set A samples will be transported with a temperature data logger and frozen with dry ice 
sufficient for 4  days, by [CONTACT_11398] -day courier to the central laboratory or bioanalytical laboratory. 
Set B samples will be shipped with a temperature data logger to the central laboratory and kept 
there until the end of the study unless requested by [CONTACT_456]. Instructions as to the disposition of the Set  B samples will be provided by [CONTACT_456]. 
Sample shipments should be sent no later in the week than Wednesday morning for next- day 
delivery. Samples are not to arrive on the weekend.

Protocol Version 2 with Amendment 01, 23 October 2017 Appendix  L. IMMUNOGENICITY SAMPLES  
Blood Sampling and Handling  
For serum collection, samples will be collected in Vacutainer tubes containing no anticoagulant, 
and allowed to set at room temperature for between 1 and 1.5 hours to allow for serum separation to occu r. Samples will then be centrifuged (1500 g, approximately 10 minutes, at 2  to 8°C). If a 
refrigerated centrifuge is not available, samples should be chilled before centrifugation. Other measures should be taken as appropriate to prevent samples from heati ng significantly during 
centrifugation. Separated serum will be transferred in approximately equal portions in the 2 provided labeled 2-mL polypropylene tubes (Sets A and  B). 
The sample vial label should include study number, patient randomization number, nominal collection time (Visit number), Set A or B, and indication that they are ADA samples. Serum 
samples will be stored at a temperature of -20°C in an upright position until they are shipped to 
the central laboratory.  
Shipment and Analysis of Samples  
Serum samples for set A all patients will be shipped from the investigational center to the central 
laboratory, where they will be stored until shipped to the sponsor or designee for analysis. 
Plasma samples set B for all patients will be shipped from the investigational center to the central 
laboratory once the set A samples are received at the central laboratory. Samples will be stored 
in an upright position at –70ºC (or at/below -20°C if no -70°C freezer available) until shipment to bioanalytical laborato ry. The bioanalytical laboratory will be notified before the shipment of 
the samples and will be sent the shippi[INVESTIGATOR_142890]. An electronic file containing the sample manifest will be emailed to the

Protocol Version 2 with Amendment 01, 23 October 2017 Appendix  M. EXPLORATORY BIOMARKERS SAMPLES  
Blood and Urine Samples  
Blood samples (total of 14.5 mL; 6 mL each for plasma and serum and 2.5 mL for RNA 
[PAXgene]) will be collected via venipuncture or indwelling catheter at the time points detailed in Table 2 for serum, plasma, and RNA biomarker measures. Urine will be collected in parallel 
with blood collection. In addition, a 6- mL whole blood sample will be collected at baseline (or a 
later visit) for DNA. Blood samples for serum and plasma should be processed within 
3-5 minutes of collection.  Details for processin g and handling of each type of biomarker sample 
will be outlined in the laboratory manual. 
All blood and urine tubes will be labeled with the patient code number. Following DNA 
extraction from the pharmacogenomic sample, the sample will be labeled with a n ew code 
(ie, double coding), so that genetic data will not be recorded with a patient number.  
Samples will be stored for a period of up to [ADDRESS_162497] patient’s last visit in the study and then destroyed. 
Shipment and Analysis of Blood and Urine Samples  
Biomarker samples for serum, plasma, RNA, and urine will be stored within 3 -5 minutes of 
processing at –70°C (or at/below -20°C if no - 70°C freezer available) and sent to the central 
laboratory on dry ice, per instructions in the laboratory manual. Sample labels should include 
study number, patient randomization number, visit code, collection date and time, and indication that they are biomarker samples. Shipments should be made as specified in the laboratory 
manual. An electronic file containing sample demographics will be emailed to the respective 
biomarker laboratory and the sponsor’s biomarker representative for each shipment. 
Following DNA extractions of whole blood, the samples will be stored at –70°C (or 
at/below -20°C if no - 70°C freezer av ailable) and labeled with a new code (ie, double coding), so 
that genomic data will not be recorded with a patient number. Data will be kept confidential and 
stored separately.  
The biomarker sample analyses will be performed if and when required. Since new  techniques 
continue to be developed, the method and laboratory that will be recommended for the future biomarker analysis cannot be anticipated.  
Saliva Samples 
Saliva samples should be collected using standard procedures as described in the Saliva 
Collect ion Handbook (SalivaBio). Briefly, saliva samples should be collected into high quality 
polypropylene tubes. Because saliva is subject to blood contamination, patients should not have blood in their mouth and should not have had dental procedures within [ADDRESS_162498] opt imal method for collecting is via  a method known as “passive drool.” Patients 
should allow saliva to pool in their mouths for 1-2 minutes, then bring collection tube to their

Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment [ADDRESS_162499] approximately 15 to 20% of open air space 
in the tube to allow for expansion of saliva after freezing. Once the proper volume has been collected, the tube should be capped and frozen within 3- 5 minutes at -70°C (or at/below -20°C 
if no - 70°C freezer available) and stored at -70°C (or at/below -20°C if no - 70°C freezer 
available) until it is shipped to the sample repository.

Protocol Version 2 with Amendment 01, 23 October 2017 APPENDIX N. PHARMACOGENETIC ASSESSMENTS  
Blood samples (6 mL) for pharmac ogenetic assessments will be collected from all patients in the 
study who signed the ICF for the pharmacogenetic assessments at the time point detailed in 
Table 2. Pharmacogenetic assessment potentially includes the association of DNA variations in specific genes of interest with clinical responses to test IMP (eg, efficacy, pharmacokinetics, 
tolerability, and safety features or disease susceptibility and severity features). The current list of 
genes with polymorphis ms associated with either CGRP target engagement or migraine 
mechanism of action includes CALCA, CALCB, CALCRL, CRCP, RAMP, PRDM16, AJAP1, 
TSPAN2, MEF2D, TRPM8, TGFBR2, PHACTR1, FHL5, C7orf10, MMP16, ASTN2, LRP1, 
APOA1BP, TBC1D7, FUT9, STAT6, ATP5B, and MT HFR ( Anttila et al 2013 ). The final list of 
genes that might be investigated will be selected at a later stage before the analysis to allow 
updating with new scientific information. Genetic analysis could also include sequenc ing of the 
whole genome if required. 
Pharmacogenetic assessment will be performed based on study results. Samples will be used 
only for investigations related to headache or response to fremanezumab or related 
investigational medicinal products. 
Details on  processes for collection and shipment of these samples can be found in the procedural 
manual.  
 Placebo -Controlled Study– Migraine  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment [ADDRESS_162500] complaint include but are not limited to: 
• suspected contamination 
• questionable stability (eg, color change, flaking, crumbling, etc) 
• defective components  
• missing or extra units (eg, primary container is received at the investigational center with more or less than the designated number of units inside) 
• incorrect packaging, or incorrect or missing labeling/labels  
• unexpected or unanticipated taste or odor, or both 
• device not working correctly or appears defective in some manner 
Each investigational center will be responsible for reporting a possible clinical product complaint by [CONTACT_142942] T eva and emailing it to 
 within 48 hours of becoming aware of the issue. 
For complaints involving a device or other retrievable item, it is required that the device (or item) be sent back to the sponsor for investigative testing whenever possible. For complaints 
involving an IMP, all relevant samples (eg, the remainder of the patient’s IMP supply) should be 
sent back to the sponsor for investigative testing whenever possible. 
1. Product Complaint Information Needed from t he Investigational Center 
In the event that the product complaint form cannot be completed, the investigator will provide the following information, as available: 
• investigational center number and principal investigator [CONTACT_2300]  
• name, phone number, and address of the source of the complaint 
• clinical protocol number 
• patient identifier (patient study number) and corresponding visit numbers, if applicable  
• product name [CONTACT_17009]- label studies  
• patient number, bottle, and kit numbers (if applicable) for double-blind or open- label 
studies 
• product available for return Yes/No 
• product was taken or used according to protocol Yes/No

• associated serious adverse event Yes/No  
• clinical supplies unblinded (for blinded studies) Yes/No 
• date and name [CONTACT_23538]: Reporting a product complaint must not be delayed even if not all the required information 
can be obtained immediately. Known information must be reported immediately. The sponsor will collaborate with  the investigator to obtain any outstanding information. 
2. Handling of Investigational Medicinal Product(s) at the Investigational Center(s) 
The investigator is responsible for retaining the product in question in a location separate from the investigator’s clinical study supplies. The sponsor may request that the investigator return the 
product for further evaluation and/or analysis. If this is necessary, the clinical study monitor or 
designee will provide the information needed for returning the IMP. 
If it is determined that the investigational center must return all IMP, the sponsor will provide the 
information needed to handle the return. 
The integrity of the randomization code and corresponding blinded clinical supplies will be 
maintained whenever possible. A serious adverse event or the potential for a product quality 
problem existing beyond the scope of the complaint may be a reason to unblind the clinical 
supplies for an affected patient. 
3. Adverse Events or Serious Adverse Events Associated with a Product Complaint  
If there is an adverse event or serious adverse event due to product complaint, the protocol should be followed for recording and reporting (Section 7.1.2 and Section  [IP_ADDRESS], respectively).  
4. Documenting a Product Complaint  
The investigator will record in the source documentation a description of the product complaint, and any actions taken to resolve the complaint and to preserve the safety of the patient. Once the complaint has been investigated by [CONTACT_16998], if necessary, an event 
closure letter may be sent to the investigational center where the complaint originated or to all 
investigational centers using the product. 
Medical device incidents, including those resulting from malfunctions of the device, must be 
detected, documented, and reported by [CONTACT_23528].

equivalent, before they are transcribed to the CRF. Data may not be recorded directly on the CRF and considered as source data unless the sponsor provides written instructions specifying which data are permitted to be recorded directly to the CRF.  
If data are processed from other institutions or by [CONTACT_11174] (eg, clinical laboratory, central image center, or electronic diary data) th e results will be sent to the investigational center, where 
they will be retained but not transcribed to the CRF, unless otherwise noted in the protocol. These data may also be sent electronically to the sponsor (or organization performing data management) . 
The medical experts, study monitors, auditors, IEC/IRB, and inspectors from competent authority (or their agents) will be given direct access to source data and documents (eg, medical charts/records, laboratory test results, printouts, videotapes) for source data verification, provided that patient confidentiality is maintained in accordance with national and local requirements.  
The investigator must maintain the original records (ie, source documents) of each patient’s dat a 
at all times.  The investigator must maintain a confidential patient identification list that allows 
the unambiguous identification of each patient. 
Data Collection 
Data will be collected using CRFs that are specifically designed for this study. The data collected 
on the CRFs will be ca ptured in a clinical data management system (CDMS) that meets the 
technical requirements described in 21CFR  Part 11 ([LOCATION_003]) and documents of other concerned 
competent authorities. Before using the CDMS, it will be fully validated and all users will receive t raining on the system and study- specific training. After they are trained, users will be 
provided with individual system access rights. 
Data will be collected at the investigational center by [CONTACT_23529], and CRFs must be completed for each patient who provided informed consent. Patient 
identity should not be discernible from the data provided on the CRF. 
If data are processed from other sources (eg, central laboratory, bioanalytical laboratory, central 
image center, electronic diary data, electronic patient -reported outcome [ePRO] tablet), these 
data will be sent to the investigational center, where they will be retained but not transcribed to 
the CRF, unless otherwise noted in the protocol. These data may also be sent ele ctronically to the 
sponsor (or organization performing data management). All patient data must have supportive original source documentation in the medical records, or equivalent, before they are transcribed to the CRF. Data may not be recorded directly on the CRF and considered as source data unless 
the sponsor provides written instructions specifying which data are permitted to be recorded directly to the CRF.

Data Quality Control 
Data Management is responsible for the accuracy, quality, completeness, and internal 
consistency of the data from this study. Oversight will be carried out as described in the sponsor’s SOPs for clinical studies. Day to day data management tasks for this study are 
delegated to a contract organization, and these functions may be carried out as described in the 
SOPs for clinical studies at that organization. These SOPs will be reviewed by [CONTACT_127668].  
Data will be verified by [CONTACT_66020], and reviewed by [CONTACT_142943]. Data identified as erroneous, or data that are missing, will be referred to the investigational center for resolution 
through data queries. Any necessary changes will be made in the clinical database, and data 
review and validation procedur es will be repeated as needed. Data from external sources will be 
compared with the information available in the CDMS and any discrepancies will be queried. 
Applicable terms will be coded according to the coding conventions for this study. 
An interim database lock will occur following the end -of-double- blind treatment visit (visit 5) of 
the last patient. A second interim lock will occur following the end of the open-label period. At 
the conclusion of the study, the CDMS and all other study data will be locked to further additions 
or corrections. Locking the study data represents the acknowledgement that all data have been captured and confirmed as accurate. All data collected will be approved by [CONTACT_142944]. This approval a cknowledges the investigator’s review and acceptance of 
the data as being complete and accurate.  
Archiving of Case Report Forms and Source Documents

Guidance  on Monitoring Patients with Elevated Liver Function Tests  
Liver enzymes (ALT, AST, GGT, and ALP) as well as total, direct, and indirect bilirubin will be 
measured at each study visit.  
In any c ase of elevated ALT or AST to a level exceeding ≥2 × the ULN (including patients 
whose baseline ALT or AST levels are ≥2 × and ≤3 × the ULN, who may be enrolled in the study), a thorough medical history and physical examination with a focus on liver disease should be undertaken.
[ADDRESS_162504] to ≥3 × ULN  
Confirmation is required prior to IMP discontinuation in cases of elevation of either ALT or AST ≥3 × ULN. (Note: In cases of elevation of ALT or AST ≥ 8 × the ULN, no confirmation is 
required prior t o IMP discontinuation, but the assessments below should be performed.) The 
following procedures should be followed: 
• The day in which the abnormal value is received from the laboratory will be considered as day 0.  
• The investigator should repeat the test for confirmation purposes (this may be performed in a local laboratory along with complete blood cell [CBC] count and 
differential to assess for eosinophilia; in general, in case a blood sample is sent to a 
local laboratory, the following assessments [and re ference ranges] are mandatory: 
ALT [serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase], AST [serum glutamic oxaloacetic 
transaminase], ALP, bilirubin [total, direct, and indirect], CBC [with differential for 
eosinophil count, separate tube], and INR [separate tube; not to be sent in a confirmatory test]). The investigator should also question the patient regarding symptoms.  
The abnormality will be regarded as confirmed in each of the following scenarios: 
• the baseline value was within the normal range and ALT or AST is st ill ≥3 × the ULN  
                                                 
1 Thorough medical history with a focus on liver disease: personal or family history of liver disease; personal hist ory 
of a systemic disease with potential liver involvement; exposure to alcohol, medications (prescription or 
over-the-counter), herbal preparations, dietary supplements, recreational drugs, special diets, or environmental 
chemical agents; potential exposure to infectious agents (eg, travel to developi[INVESTIGATOR_14696], history of potential 
exposure to blood or blood products, high- risk sexual relations); and any additional information deemed relevant 
by [CONTACT_093]. Physical examination, including signs of  chronic liver disease.

Additional Tests/Evaluations:  
Upon confirmation of the abnormality as noted above, the following additional evaluations 
should be performed and results should be recorded in the CRF:  
• serology for hepatitis A (antibody and immunoglobulins M and G), B (core antibody total, core immunoglobulin M, and surface antigen), and C viruses (central laboratory) 
• serology for autoimmune hepatitis: anti- nuclear antibodies (tite r), anti -smooth muscle 
antibodies, and anti-liver kidney microsomal antibodies (central laboratory); further testing may be required in case of a positive result for hepatitis B or C 
• ultrasound examination of the liver and biliary tract at the investigator’s discretion  
• other diagnostic tests/consultations as deemed necessary by [CONTACT_093] 
(eg, serology for hepatitis E virus in case of travel to endemic geography)  
• observation and follow-up (to be performed after the abnormality was confirmed as 
above) 
ALT or AST ≥3 × (>3.5 × the ULN if the Baseline Value is >2.5 × the ULN) but <5 × the ULN 
In addition to the above procedures required for any elevation to levels >3 × the ULN: 
• Alanine aminotransferase, AST, GGT, ALP, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, indirect 
bilirubin, CBC and differential (to assess for eosinophilia), and INR should be monitored on days 5 (±2  days), 8 (±2 days), 14 (±3 days), and 28 (±3 days). On at 
least [ADDRESS_162505] should be performed centrally. (The INR should be sent 
to a local laboratory  only.) 
• In cases where a local laboratory is used, the results should be recorded in the CRF, accompanied by [CONTACT_66015].  
• Should the abnormality (≥3 × the ULN in case baseline was within the normal range or ≥2 ×  the ULN in case the baseline value was above ULN but still <5 × the ULN) 
persist further, the patient will be followed according to the investigator’s discretion, but a blood sample for ALT, AST, GGT, ALP, and total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, indirect bilirubin should be sent to the central laboratory at least once a month. 
ALT or AST ≥5 × but <8 × the ULN  
In addition to the above procedures required for any elevation to levels >3 × the ULN:  
• Alanine aminotransferase, AST, GGT, ALP, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, indirect bilirubin, CBC and differential count (to assess for eosinophilia), and INR should be monitored twice a  week.

Protocol Version 2 with Amendment 01, 23 October 2017 • At least for every other measuremen t, the tests should be sent to the central 
laboratory. The rest of the tests may be sent to a local laboratory. The INR should 
always be sent to a local laboratory.  
ALT or AST ≥8 × the ULN  
In addition to the above procedures required for any elevation to levels >3 × the ULN: 
• The IMP should be discontinued immediately, and the early withdrawal visit should be performed.  
• For follow-up guidance, please see below section “Follow-Up of Liver Enzymes After Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_65913].” 
Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_65914], the IMP will be discontinued immediately: 
• any increase in ALT or AST to ≥3 × the ULN, combined with INR >1.5 × the ULN or total bilirubin >2 × the ULN 
• any increase in ALT or AST to ≥3 × the ULN, which is accompanied by [CONTACT_127686] (eg, vomiting, nausea, fever, rash, and 
eosinophilia) and not deemed related to other diseases (eg, vomiting or nausea 
triggered b y cluster headache)  
• any increase in ALT or AST to levels ≥5 but <8 × the ULN, which is persistent for ≥2 weeks of repeated measurements  
• any increase in ALT or AST to levels ≥8 × the ULN  
• in any case where monitoring of liver enzymes cannot be performed acco rding to the 
protocol guidance 
Follow- Up of Liver Enzymes After Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_65913]  
• A patient who meets the above criteria for discontinuation of the IMP should be invited to the investigational site to return the IMP. Early withdrawal visit activities should be performed as soon as possible. 
• Liver enzymes should be monitored until normalization or stabilization of the abnormality, according to the discretion of the investigator. 
• In any case, following the early withdrawal visit, the minimal follow -up pe riod will 
be [ADDRESS_162506] once weekly (may 
be performed in local laboratory, with at least [ADDRESS_162507] being sent to the central 
laboratory). 
Every effort should be made to complete the additional tests/evaluations, as described above.

As detailed by [CONTACT_49732] 2006, anaphylaxis is broadly defined as, “a serious allergic reaction 
that is rapid in onset and may cause death.” Diagnostic criteria defined by [CONTACT_142945]/Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network during the second 
symposium on the definition and management of anaphylaxis, modified from Sampson et al 2006, are as follows:  
Anaphylaxis is highly likely when any 1 of the following 3 criteria is fulfilled: 
5. Acute onset of an illness (minutes to several hours) with involvement of the skin, mucosal tissue, or both (eg, generalized hives, pruritus or flushing, swollen lips-tongue-uvula) and at least 1 of the following: 
a. respi[INVESTIGATOR_7798] (eg, dyspnea, wheeze-bronchospasm, stridor, reduced peak 
expi[INVESTIGATOR_10229] [PEF], hypoxemia) 
b. reduced blood pressure or associated symptoms of end-organ dysfunction (eg, hypotonia [collapse], syncope, incontinence) 
6. Two or more of the following that occur rapi[INVESTIGATOR_17176] a likely  allergen for 
that patient (minutes to several hours): 
a. involvement of the skin- mucosal tissue (eg, generalized hives, itch -flush, swollen 
lips-tongue-uvula) 
b. respi[INVESTIGATOR_7798] (eg, dyspnea, wheeze-bronchospasm, stridor, reduced PEF, hypoxemia)  
c. reduced blood pressure or associated symptoms (eg, hypotonia [collapse], syncope, incontinence) 
d. persistent gastrointestinal symptoms (eg, crampy abdominal p ain, vomiting) 
7. Reduced blood pressure after exposure to known allergen for that patient  (minutes to 
several hours): 
a. adults: systolic blood pressure of <90 mm Hg or >30% decrease from that person’s baseline  
In the event of suspected anaphylaxis, vital signs, including oxygen saturation and respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487], will be measured. Other assessments will be performed at the discretion of the investigator. As a precaution, each investigational site should have a resuscitation cart nearby.

1.1 PROTOCOL  SUMMARY  AND/OR  SCHEMA  
 
Title:  A Phase  II Randomized  Controlled  Screening  Trial of Nivolumab  with Image  
Guided,  Stereotactic  Body  Radiotherapy  (SBRT)  versus  Nivolumab  Alone  in Patients  with 
Metastatic  Head  and Neck  Squamous  Cell Carcinoma  (HNSCC).  
Brief  Background:   Nivolumab  is a fully human  monoclonal  immunoglobulin  G4 antibody  
that binds  to programmed  death -1 (PD-1) cell surface  membrane  receptor,  a negative  
regulatory  molecule  expressed  by [CONTACT_93247]  T and B lymphocytes.   Inhibition  of the 
interaction  between  PD-1 and its ligands  (e.g. PD-L1) promotes  immune  responses  and 
antigen -specific  T cell responses  to both foreign  antigens  as well as self antigens. [1] 
In early phase  clinical  trials in a variety  of malignancies,  including  HNSCC,  anti-PD-[ADDRESS_1125826]  minority  of patients  with 
HNSCC  (20%)  [2].   Accumulating  pre-clinical  evidence  suggests  a role for relatively  high- 
dose -per-fraction  radiotherapy  in up-regulating  adaptive  immune  response  against  
established  malignancies.   This can occur  through  a variety  of mechanisms,  including  
radiation -induced  increases  in tumor -antigen  presentation  by [CONTACT_813017] 
(ADCs),  increases  in tumor  cell phagocytosis  by [CONTACT_813018],  increases  in secretion  of 
“danger  signals”  such  as HMGB1,  and decreases  in peripheral  myeloid  derived   
suppressor  cells [3, 4].  Compared  to conventional  fractionated  radiation  therapy  (1.8 Gy  
to 2 Gy per fraction),  higher  dose -per-fraction  radiation  therapy,  delivered  by [CONTACT_813019],  
image  guided  mechanisms  has shown  increased  T- cell activity  [5]. Even  more  tanta lizing,  
recent  evidence  in patient -derived  xenograft  models  have demonstrated  potentially  
powerful  synergy  between  high-dose  radiotherapy  and anti-PD-L1 antibody  therapy  
(another  mechanism  of PD-1:PD -L1 signaling  inhibition)  [6].  The concomitant  
administration  of radiation  to a single  metastasis  and anti-PD-L1 therapy  proved  capable  
of dramatic  reductions  in non-irradiated  metastases  above  and beyond  the regression  
seen  with anti-PD-L1 therapy  alone.   This radiation -induced  regression  of non-irradiated  
systemic  disease  is termed  the abscopal  effect .  Multiple  case  reports  have also now been  
published  purportedly  demonstrating  the same  phenomenon  in patients  who had initially  
progressed  through  checkpoint  inhibitory  therapy  [7] . 
Research  Hypothesis:  The concomitant  administration  of SBRT  with Nivolumab  will 
result  in a significant  increase  in objective  response  rate above  and beyond  Nivolumab  
alone  in patients  with metastatic  HNSCC.

3.0 BACKGROUND  AND RATIONALE  
 
3.1 Overall  Study  Rationale  
 
Substantial  pre-clinical  data has accumulated  suggesting  that higher -dose  per fraction  
radiation  therapy  (SBRT)  can enhance  immune  surveillance  of extant  tumors.   Over  the 
past several  years,  early phase  clinical  trials involving   novel  immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]  — 
specifically  mono -clonal  anti-body inhibitors  of various  immune  checkpoints --have  shown  
impressive  tumor  control  outcomes.   Herein  we outline  a randomized,  open  label,  Phase  2

 trial designed  to determine  whether  clinically  significant  synergy  exists  between  the 
immune  checkpoint  inhibitor  Nivolumab  and high dose  per fraction,  stereotactic  body 
radiotherapy  (SBRT)  in patients  with metastatic  HNSCC.  
3.[ADDRESS_1125828]  of Care  in Metastatic  Head  and Neck  Squamous  Cell 
Carcinoma  (HNSCC)  
HNSCC  is currently  the fifth most  common  incident  cancer  worldwide.   Within  the United  
States  in 2013,  53,640  new cases  of HNSCC  were  diagnosed,  with approximately  11,500  
deaths  attributed  to this disease.  The specific  anatomic  locations  that fall under  the 
HNSCC  diagnostic  umbrella  include  oral cavity,  oropharynx,  larynx,  hypopharynx,  
nasopharynx,  nasal  cavity,  and para-nasal  sinuses  [8].  Broadly  speaking,  HNSCC  can be 
divided  into tumors  that arise  from excessive  toxic exposures,  namely  alcohol  and 
tobacco,  and those  that arise  as a result  of viral infections,  specifically  the Epstein -Barr 
virus (EBV)  in nasopharyngeal  carcinoma,  and the Human  Papi[INVESTIGATOR_812980]  (HPV)  in 
oropharynx  cancer.  
At initial  diagnosis,  approximately  10% of patients  with HNSCC  will have metastatic  (Stage  
IV-C) disease.  For patients  with locally  advanced,  non-metastatic  HNSCC  at diagnosis  
(Stage  III-IVA/B),   approximately  50% treated  with definitive  surgery  or concurrent  chemo - 
radiotherapy  will recur.   In recurrent  disease  with a metastatic  component,  median  
progression  free survival  (PFS)  is ≤ 6 months  [9]. 
Treatment  of metastatic  disease  typi[INVESTIGATOR_812981]  (e.g. 
methotrexate,  organoplatinum  compounds,  5-fluorouracil  (5FU),  or taxanes)  oftentimes  in 
combination  with the monoclonal  anti-body  inhibitor  of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_245322]  (EGFR),  Cetuximab.   Additionally,   it is not uncommon  for patients  to undergo  
palliative  radiation  therapy  to synchronous  loco-regional  disease  because  of the high 
potential  morbidity  of continued  progression  in the head  and neck region.   A Phase  [ADDRESS_1125829]  of care for well 
performing  patients  with metastatic  HNSCC  [10].  Therein  they found  a significant  
improvement  in overall  survival  (OS)  comparing  patients  that received  5FU, a platinum  
agent,  and Cetuximab  to those  who received  5FU and a platinum  agent  alone  (10.1  
months  versus  7.4 months).   A recent  retrospective  report  on response  rates  to tri-modal  
treatment  with 5FU, platinum,  and cetuximab  as a first line therapy  in metastatic  HNSCC  
showed  an ORR  of approximately  23.9%  [11]. 
Tumor  response  rates  in metastatic  patients  who have progressed  through  or recurred  
after a first-line platinum -containing  therapy  are even lower;  a single  arm, Phase  2 trial of 
Cetuximab monotherapy in patients who had failed a prior platinum-containing therapy 
showed  an ORR  of 13%.   In examining  multiple  studies  of patients  in this cohort,  median  
OS is approximately  3-4 months,  with survival  at 1 year of approximately  5% [12]. 
In sum,  response  rates  in both the 1st line and 2nd  line settings  in metastatic  HNSCC  are 
underwhelming.   More  broadly,  chemotherapeutic  options  in this disease  are limited.   The 
need  for more  potent  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_812982].

Administrative Update 3 : [ADDRESS_1125830] decade,  substantial  evidence  has accrued  demonstrating  the critical  role  
that the immune  system  plays  in the development  and progression  of HNSCC.   The two 
primary  pathways  by [CONTACT_813022] —chemical  carcinogenesis  and human  
papi[INVESTIGATOR_304966] (HPV)  infection —both involve  a failure  of immune  surveillance;   tumor  cells 
escape  cytotoxic  T-lymphocyte -based  adaptive  immune  destruction.  
HNSCC  employs  multiple  mechanisms  of immune  escape  [13].  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_812983]  (TA) exist in HNSCC  along  with their cognate  TA-specific  
cytotoxic  T-lymphocytes  (CTLs  specific  for EGFR,  E7 HPV oncoprotein,  etc), these  TA- 
specific   CTLs  fail to eradicate  their targets.   One evasive  maneuver  used  by [CONTACT_813023] -regulation  of human  leukocyte  antigen  (HLA)  1, the 
MHC  molecule  required  for interaction  between  TA and TA-specific  CTLs.  Additionally,   it 
has been  shown  by [CONTACT_813024]  (APM).   This deficiency  also extends  
to nearby  [CONTACT_813018] (DC),  themselves  critical  intermediaries  of antigen  presentation.  
However,  it is not just failure  to present  CTLs  with viable  tumor -specific  targets  that 
cripples  the adaptive  immune  response  to HNSCC,  it is also the de-activation  of the CTLs  
themselves  that compounds  the degree  of suppression.   This deactivation  occurs  via an 
alteration  in the balance  of co-stimulatory  (e.g. OX40  and 4-1BB)  and co-inhibitory  
receptors  (e.g. T-lymphocyte -associated  antigen  4 (CTLA -4) and programmed -death  1 
(PD-1)) expressed  by [CONTACT_813025]  (PD-L1, B7,etc),  expressed  by [CONTACT_398]4+  
helper  T cells,  DCs,  myeloid  derived  suppressor  cells (MDSCs), and tumor  cells.   In the 
functioning  immune  system,  expression  of co-stimulatory  receptors  and ligands  are 
requisite  requirements  for the successful  activation  of CTLs  in the face of foreign  antigen  
presentation.   Once  an infectious  threat  has been  eliminated,  the binding  of CTL,  
membrane  bound  co-inhibitory  receptors,  such  as cytotoxic  T-lymphocyte -associated  
antigen  4 (CTLA -4) and programmed -death  1, to their cognate  ligands  serves  to dampen  
any further  adaptive  response  and promote  functional  anergy.   In addition  to CTLs,  PD-1 
is also expressed  by [CONTACT_813026]  T-regulatory  (Treg)  cells where  receptor  
engagement  may be critical  to the Treg cell’s  suppressive  function.   There  is now 
mounting  evidence  that HNSCC  has co-opted  these  co-signaling  pathways  in order  to 
facilitate  profound  intra-tumoral  immunosuppression  [14, 15]. 
3.3.2  Programmed  Cell Death  1 (PD-1) in HNSCC  
 
The data demonstrating  the PD-1:PD -L1 pathway  as a major  mechanism  of immune  
escape  in HNSCC  have become  increasingly  robust  over the last few years.   A member  of 
the CD28  family,  PD-1 is a 55kD,  type I transmembrane  T-cell co-stimulatory  receptor.  
The receptor  contains  an intracellular  immunoreceptor  inhibitor  motif  (ITIM)   and a 
membrane  distal  immunoreceptor  tyrosine -based  switch  motif  (ITSM).  The two known  
ligands  of PD-1 are PD-L1 and PD-L2 which,  upon  binding  to PD-1, deactivate  T cells.  
The down -regulation  of T-cell activation  is mediated  via SHP-2 binding  to the 
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 15 -253 A(11)  
Approval date: 13 -Mar-2018 
Administrative Update 3 : [ADDRESS_1125831] shown  high levels  of PD-L1 expression  in 46%-100%  of tumors  in 
treatment  naïve  primary,  recurrent,  and metastatic  HNSCC  [16].  Moreover,   there  appears  
to be differential  PD-L1 expression  in HNSCC  lesions  depending  upon  etiology,  with HPV- 
positive  tumors  having  a statistically  significant  higher  expression  (49.2 -65.2%  vs 34.1% - 
40%).   In addition  to tumor  cells themselves,  there  are data suggesting  that peripheral  
blood  MDSCs, in-part responsible  for suppression  of T cell activation  and migration,  show  
increased  PD-L1 expression  in HNSCC;  this up-regulation  of PD-L1 expression  is also 
seen  in intratumoral  Tregs  in HNSCC.   This enhancement  of PD-L1 on tumor  cells,  
MDSCs, and Tregs  is matched  by a commensurate  increase  in PD-1 expression  by [CONTACT_813027]8+  T cells in the peripheral  blood,  and, to an even greater  degree,  CD8+  T cells in the 
tumors  of HNSCC  patients;  this was seen  in both HPV positive  and negative  patients.  
Moreover,  in vitro blockade  of PD-1 in these  CD8+  T cells enhanced  their adaptive  
function.  
The above  pre-clinical  data argue  that the PD-1:PD -L1 axis plays  an important  role in both 
HPV positive  and HPV negative  HNSCC  pathogenesis.   Because  of the strength  of the 
above  pre-clinical  data and the impressive  results  seen  in other  solid malignancies  treated  
with anti-PD-1 therapy,  Seiwert,  et al devised,  ran, and recently  reported  on a Phase  Ib  
trial involving  60 recurrent/metastatic  HNSCC  patients  with tumors  positive  for PD-L1 
treated  with Pembrolizumab,  a humanized  monoclonal  IgG4 antibody  directed  against  PD- 
1.  They  screened  104 patients  for PD-L1 expression;  77.9%  of patients  were  positive  
(defined  as >=1%  of cells in the tumor  microenvironment  staining  for PD-L1); of the 
positive  patients,  sixty were  eventually  enrolled  on the trial, [ADDRESS_1125832] overall  response  rate was 20%,  a percentage  that was identical  
regardless  of HPV status.   Approximately  89% of the enrolled  patients  had undergone   
prior systemic  treatment  [2]. 
Although  in the aforementioned  study,  patients  were  selected  for inclusion  only if their 
tumors  expressed  PD-L1, data from melanoma,  non-small  cell lung cancer,  and renal  cell 
carcinoma  shows  the potential  for a still robust  response  in PD-L1 negative  patients  [17]. 
Therefore,  in our own trial, we have chosen  to include  patients  regardless  of PD-L1 
expression  status.  
3.3.3  Nivolumab  Efficacy  and Safety  
 
In our own trial, we will use Nivolumab  as the anti-PD-1 agent.   Nivolumab  is a fully human  
monoclonal  immunoglobulin  IgG4 antibody  that binds  to PD-1 cell surface  membrane  
receptor.   A recently  reported  on Phase  I open  label,  multiple  dose  escalation  study  
investigated  the safety  and efficacy  of Nivolumab  in 304 patients  with melanoma,  renal  cell 
carcinoma,  non-small  cell lung carcinoma  (NSCLC),  colorectal  cancer,  or hormone  
refractory  prostate  cancer  [18].  Squamous  NSCLC  is the histology  most  biologically   
similar  to HNSCC.   For NSCLC,  the most  active  doses  were  3 and 10 mg/kg,  with a 
reported  ORR  of between  19% and 26%,  with durable  responses  observed  in both

 squamous  and non-squamous  subtypes.  There  was no maximally  tolerated  dose  identified  
in the above  Phase  I trial.  Drug -related  adverse  events  occurring  in >5% of subjects  
included,  in order  of most  frequent  to least frequent:  fatigue,  rash,  diarrhea,  pruritus,  
nausea,  decreased  appetite,  decreased  hemoglobin,  and pyrexia.    Approximately  15% of 
patients  experienced  Grade  3 or 4 adverse  events.   Those  occurring  in greater  than >1% 
of research  subjects  included:  fatigue  (1.6%),  lymphopenia  (1.3%),  abdominal  pain (1%),  
diarrhea  (1%),  hypophosphatemia  (1%) and pneumonitis  (1%).  Approximately  49% of 
patients  on the Phase  I study  experienced  a severe  adverse  event  (SAE);  7.6%  of patients  
experienced  a Grade  3-4 SAE.   Drug -related  SAEs  occurred  in 11.5%  of patients.   Grade  
3-4 SAEs  that occurred  in 2 or more  study  subjects  included:  diarrhea  (1%),  pneumonitis  
(1%),  pneumonia  (0.7%),  and increased  lipase  (0.7%).   Only 5.9%  of patients  had their 
treatment  discontinued  because  of an SAE.   These  SAEs  included  pneumonitis  (4 
subjects)  and hepatitis  (2 subjects).  There  were  3 treatment -related  deaths  (1%),  all 
related  to pneumonitis.  
Siewert,  et al recently  updated  their experience  with Pembrolizumab  (MK-3475)  in an 
unselected  group  (both  PDL1  positive  and negative)  of patients  with recurrent/metastatic  
HNSCC.   In this expansion  cohort  of KEYNOTE  012, ORR  (confirmed  and unconfirmed)  
per RECIST  1.1 was 18.2%  (95%  CI, 11.1-27.2)  [19]. 
3.4 Rationale  for and Safety  of Combining  Nivolumab  with Stereotactic  Body  
Radiation  Therapy  (SBRT)  
The data examining  the immune -modulatory  effects  of radiation  are substantial.   Several  
groups  have reported  an up-regulation  of pro-inflammatory  cytokines  in response  to 
ionizing  radiation,  namely  TNF,  IL-1alpha,   and IL-1beta  [20].  These  inflammatory  
cytokines  in turn promote  the expression  of critical  leukocyte  adhesion  molecules  (e.g. 
ICAM -1, VCAM -1, and E-selectin).    Given  the above  biology,  it is not surprising  that 
irradiation  has been  shown  to enhance  T-cell infiltration  into the tumor  microenvironment.  
Once  intercalated  into the microenvironment,  radiation  also serves  to promote  T-cell 
activation  by [CONTACT_813028]  I and II 
molecules  [21].  In addition,  several  studies  have demonstrated  that radiation  tends  to 
results  in immunogenic  tumor  cell death  via necrosis  and mitotic  catastrophe  [22]. The 
release  of endogenous  danger  signals,  such  as HMGB1  and ATP,  that accompany  these  
types  of tumor  cell kill lead to the engagement  of the innate  immune  system via the Toll- 
Like Receptors  (e.g. TLR4)  found  on antigen  presenting  cells (APCs).    Activated  APCs  
serve  to further  enhance  anti-tumor  T-cell response.  
Radiation -related  induction  of T-cell activity  is not just incidental  to but rather  necessary  for 
the anti-tumor  effect  of radiotherapy  [23].  Indeed,  several  studies  have shown  that 
depletion  of CD8+  T cells significantly  hampers  radiation -related  retardation  of local tumor  
growth.   But radiation  alone  rarely  generates  a systemic,  immune -mediated  anti-tumor  
response —the so called  “abscopal  effect”.   There  has thus been  great  interest  in 
combining  radiotherapy  with immune  modulatory  agents  like Nivolumab  in the hope  that 
the synergy  between  the two therapi[INVESTIGATOR_812984]- 
tumor  immunity  and subsequent  regression  of metastatic  disease  outside  of the irradiated  
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 15 -253 A(11)  
Approval date: 13 -Mar-2018 
Administrative Update 3 : [ADDRESS_1125833] hinted  at the ability  of such  a combinatorial  
strategy  to accomplish  this. Deng,  et al reported  that 12Gy  of ionizing  radiation  delivered  to 
a mammary  carcinoma  established  on the flank of a mouse  in combination  with an anti-PD- 
L1 antibody  led to the sustained  regression  of tumors  implanted  on the contralateral  flank 
of the animal,  whereas  no suchcontralateral responses  were  elicited  when  the animals  were  
treated  with either  radiation  or anti-PD-L1 alone  [6]. A recently  completed  Phase  I study  
combined  SBRT  (20 Gy per fraction)  with IL-2, an older,  established  immune -modulatory  
agent,  in patients  with metastatic  renal  cell or melanoma.  They  reported  CRs or PRs in 
66.6%  of patients,  rates  far in excess of those  expected  with IL-2 alone  [24].  More  pertinent  
to our own study,  Postow,  et al, reported  on a melanoma  patient  who, having  had 
progressive  disease  while  on Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125],  a mono -clonal  antibody  directed  against  the 
checkpoint  inhibitor  CTLA -4, demonstrated  dramatic  tumor  regression  after receiving  SBRT  
(8.5 Gy x 3) concurrent  with Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_812985]  [25].  A further,  and perhaps  more  dramatic  demonstration  
of synergy  was reported  by [CONTACT_813029],  et al in a patient  with metastatic  lung adenocarcinoma,  
a histology  that had demonstrated  relatively  unimpressive  responses  to single  agent  
Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125].  In their case report,  a patient  with widespread  metastases  received  SBRT  (6 
Gy x 5) to a liver lesion  with infusion  of Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_812986] [ADDRESS_1125834]-treatment,  dramatic  regression  was 
seen  in both the irradiated  lesion  and in multiple  osseous  and hepatic  metastases  [26, 27]. 
Little data exists  with regard  to the safety  of combined  immunologic  checkpoint  inhibition  
and radiotherapy.  However,  Barker,  et al recently  reported  on the Memorial  Sloan  Kettering  
institutional  experience  with Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_812987]-brain  radiotherapy  [27]. They  found  no 
evidence  of increased  adverse  effects  compared  to Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_582854].  Many  of the patients  
included  in this retrospective  report  received  SBRT  with various  dosing  schemas.  
3.4.1  Rationale  for Radiation  Dose  and Fractionation  in Combination  with Nivolumab  
 
Data with regards  to appropriate  dose  per fraction  is somewhat  limited.  Reits,  et al 
examined  MHC -1 up-regulation  in response  to variety  of single  dose  radiation  regimens  
[28]. They  found  that [ADDRESS_1125835] able to 
generate  anti-tumor  immunity  without  increasing  the proportion  of T-regulatory  cells.  
Addressing  specifically  the optimal  fractionation  in combination  with checkpoint  inhibitors,  
Dewan,  et al evaluated  three  dose schemes  [29]: 20 Gy x 1, 8 Gy x 3, and 6 Gy x 5. They  
found  that the two fractionated  regimens  (8 Gy x 3 and 6 Gy x 5) resulted  in more dramatic  
reductions  in non-irradiated  systemic  disease  compared  to the single  fraction  dose  in mouse

effective,  causing  regression  in 40% of tumors  outside  the irradiated  field. This was nearly  
the same  fractionation  scheme  used  by [CONTACT_813030],  et al in their seminal  report.  
Given  the above  data,  we have chosen  a dose  fractionation  of [ADDRESS_1125837]  the colorectal   cancer  
antigen  GUCY2C  in a murine  subcutaneous  tumor  model  using  mouse  CT26  colon  cancer  
cells [30]. They  found  that T cell responses  were  enhanced  and tumor  eradication  
maximized  when  RT was administered  prior to the vaccine.  
Deng,  et al, in their study  of anti-PD-L1 antibody  in combination  with RT delivered  the 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_812988]-PD-L1 given  [ADDRESS_1125838] fraction  of 
radiation.  
 
 
4.1 OVERVIEW  OF STUDY  DESIGN/INTERVENTION  
 
4.2 Design  
 
This is a randomized  (1:1),  open  label Phase  2 screening  trial in subjects  ≥ 18 years  old 
with metastatic  HNSCC.   Subjects  will stratified  based  on viral status  (p16+  OPC/EBER+  
NPC vs others)  and then randomized  to either  Nivolumab  with interdigitated  SBRT  or 
Nivolumab  alone.  
Subjects  must  undergo  screening  evaluations  to determine  eligibility  within  28 days prior 
to randomization.  
Sixty (60) subjects  will be randomized  to one of the following  arms:  
 
• Arm 1:  Nivolumab  3mg/kg  IV every  2 weeks  
• Arm 2: 
o Image  Guided,  Stereotactic  Body  Radiotherapy  (27 Gy over 3 fractions  
given  every  other  day) to a single  lesion  to start by [CONTACT_611487] 14 (study day 
[ADDRESS_1125839] dose  of Nivolumab).  
o Nivolumab  3mg/kg  IV starting  day 1and  then every  2 weeks  thereafter.  
• Treatment  with Nivolumab  will continue  until progression  or unacceptable  toxicity.

2) Eastern  Cooperative  Oncology  Group  (ECOG)  performance  status  ≤ 2. 
3) Histologically  confirmed  metastatic  HNSCC,  including  nasopharynx  WHO  Type  I-III 
histologies;  patients  can have simultaneous  loco-regional  disease.  
4) Subjects  must  have at least two lesions:  
o One lesion  must  be safely  amenable  to irradiation  in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_812989].  This can be a lesion that was previously irradiated as long 
as prior radiation  preceded  projected  first fraction  of SBRT  by [CONTACT_2669] [ADDRESS_1125840]  
1.1 criteria.  
5) Available   formalin  fixed,  paraffin -embedded  (FFPE)  tumor  tissue  block  with unstained  
slides  of tumor  sample  obtained  via excisional,  incisional,  or core needle  biopsy  from a 
loco-regionally  recurrent  or metastatic  lesion;  FFPE  tumor  tissue  block  with unstained  
slides  from the primary  disease  is acceptable  with approval  of principal  investigator.  
6) Documentation  of tumor  viral status  (p16 testing  for oropharynx,  EBER  for 
nasopharynx).   Tests  done  on primary  tumor  specimens  at outside  institutions  are 
sufficient  to meet  this criterion.  
7) Prior palliative  or curative  radiotherapy  must  be completed  at least 14 days prior to 
randomization.  
Key Exclusion  Criteria:  
 
1) Active  brain  metastases  or leptomeningeal  metastases  are not allowed.  
2) Non-squamous  histologies  are not allowed;  an exception  is made  for WHO  Type  I-III 
nasopharynx  histologies.  
3) Prior treatment  with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, anti-PD-L2 antibody.  
4) Prior active  malignancy  within  the previous  [ADDRESS_1125841],  or cervix  cancer.   If other  prior malignancy  was active  within  prior 3 years,  
enrollment  requires  approval  of a principal  investigator.  
5) Subjects  with active,  known  or suspected  auto-immune  disease.   Subjects  with vitiligo,  
type 1 diabetes  mellitus,  residual  hypothyroidism  due to autoimmune  condition  only 
requiring  hormone  replacement,  psoriasis  not requiring  systemic  treatment,  or 
conditions  not expected  to recur  in the absence  of an external  trigger  are eligible  to 
enroll.  
6) Subjects  with a condition  requiring  systemic  treatment  with either  corticosteroids  (> 10 
mg daily prednisone  equivalents)  or other  immunosuppressive  medications  within  14 
days of study  drug administration.   Inhaled  or topi[INVESTIGATOR_812990]  >10mg  daily prednisone  equivalents  are permitted  in the absence  of active  
autoimmune  disease.  
Based  upon  an estimated  ORR  of 15% in the Nivolumab  alone  arm in a PD-L1 unselected  
population  and an ORR  of 45% in the Nivolumab  and SBRT  arm, the enrollment  of 54 
patients  will provide  a one-sided  alpha  of 0.10 and a power  of 0.80.   Assuming  a 10% 
drop-out rate, we will seek to enroll  60 patients.   Patients  will be randomized  to the two

 treatment  arms  in a 1:1 ratio (30 subjects in Arm 1 and 30 subjects  in Arm 2).  Patients  will 
be stratified  based  upon  viral status  (HPV/EBV+  vs not).  ORR  will be assessed  by [CONTACT_813031]  1.[ADDRESS_1125842] been  randomized  
to this arm.  Using  data from recently  reported  early phase  trials of Nivolumab  in NSCLC,  
we view 14% as an acceptable  rate of acute  (within  3 months  of study  initiation)  >= Grade  
3 treatment -related  adverse  events;  an unacceptable  rate of acute  >= Grade  3 treatment - 
related  adverse  events  is 30%.  If more  than 5 (e.g. 6 or more)  of the first 20 patients  
experience  an acute  >= Grade  3 treatment -related  adverse  event,  the trial will be stopped  
early.  If the true toxicity  rate is 30%,  the above  boundary  assures a 58% probability  of 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_812991];  if the true toxicity  rate is 40%,  there  is an 87% chance  
of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_812992].  If the true toxicity  rate is 14%,  the above  boundary  has only a  
5% probability  of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_812992].  Of note,  for radiation  dermatitis,  only Grade  [ADDRESS_1125843]  of three  phases:   screening,  treatment,  and follow -up. 
Screening  Phase:  
• Establishment  of initial  eligibility  and signing  of the informed  consent.  
• Confirmation  that tumor  tissue  from a metastatic  or loco-regionally  recurrent  lesion  
is available  for biomarker  analysis;  if none  is available  and biopsy  not an option,  
with the permission  of the principal  investigator,  tumor  tissue  from the primary  site 
at initial  diagnosis  is acceptable.  
• HPV status will  be determined  via p16 IHC staining  or HPV ISH or PCR  for all 
oropharynx  primaries.   The p16 staining  will be interpreted  as positive  if >70%  
strong  and diffuse  nuclear  and cytoplasmic  staining  is specific  to tumor  cells.  
Status  will be reported  dichotomously  as positive  or negative.   EBER  staining  will 
be reported  as well for patients  with nasopharynx  cancer.   For non-oropharynx  and 
non-nasopharynx  primaries,  these  tests  are not required.   Tests  previously

radiation  treatments  will be delivered  over 10 business  days at a frequency  no 
greater  than every  other  day. 
• All of the laboratories  and vital signs  will be collected  prior to study  drug dosing  at 
the time points  specified.  
• Adverse  events  will be documented  at the time points  specified.  
• Biomarker  and immunogenicity  samples  will be obtained  according  to the outlined

week  8 (+/- 2 weeks),  every  8 weeks  (+/-2 weeks)  for the first 48 weeks  and every  
12 weeks  (+/- 2 weeks)  until either  week  96 or disease  progression  (whichever  
occurs  first).  
• Nivolumab  is administered  as an IV infusion  every  14 days (+/- 2 days)  until 
disease  progression  (or until discontinuation  of Nivolumab  in subjects  receiving  
beyond  progression),  unacceptable  toxicity,  or withdrawal  of consent.  
• Response  is evaluated  using  RECIST  1.[ADDRESS_1125844] tumor  assessment  of non-irradiated  lesions  will occur  at week  8 (+/- 2 weeks)  
after treatment  initiation  and then every  8 weeks  (+/-2 weeks)  for the first 48 weeks  and 
then every  12 weeks  (+/-2 weeks)  until documented  progression  or week  [ADDRESS_1125845],  abdomen,  pelvis,  head,  neck,  and all known  sites 
of disease  should  be obtained.   The same  imaging  modality  that was used  as baseline  
should  be used  at all subsequent  evaluations.  
• After week  96 of treatment,  patients  will be contact[CONTACT_737499]  3 months  for survival.  
This can be done  by [CONTACT_813032] -up. 
• Treatment  phase  will conclude  at the time of study  drug discontinuation.

5.0 THERAPEUTIC/DIAGNOSTIC  AGENTS  
 
5.1 Nivolumab   (BMS -936558)  
 
Nivolumab  is a fully human  monoclonal  immunoglobulin  G4 antibody  that binds  to the 
programmed  death -1 (PD-1) cell surface  membrane  receptor,  a negative  regulatory  
molecule  expressed  by [CONTACT_93247]  T and B Lymphocytes.  
Nivolumab  has a concentration  of 10mg/mL  and is provided  in a 10mL  vial.  Nivolumab  
infusion  concentration  must  be at or above  the minimum  allowable  concentration  of 0.35 
mg/mL.  
Nivolumab  will be provided  by [CONTACT_20444] (Bristol -Myers  Squibb)  and shipped  directly  to the site 
where  it is to be administered.  
Nivolumab  (OPDIVO)  is approved  for the treatment  of unresectable  or metastatic  
melanoma  in multiple  countries  including  Japan,  the US, and EU.  It is also approved  for 
the treatment  of metastatic  squamous  cell NSCLC in the US. 
5.1.1  Storage  Conditions  and Handling  
 
Nivolumab  should  be stored  at between  2-8 degrees  Celsius  (36-46 degrees  Fahrenheit),  
and protected  from light, freezing,  and shaken.   If any temperature  excursions  are 
encountered  during  storage,  they should  be reported  to BMS.   As with all injectable  drugs,  
care should  be taken  when  handling  and preparing  Nivolumab.   Whenever  possible,  
Nivolumab  should  be prepared  in a laminar  flow hood  or safety  cabinet  using  standard  
precautions  for the safe handling  of intravenous  agents  applying  aseptic  technique.  
Partially  used  vials should  be disposed  at the time following  procedures  for the disposal  of 
anticancer  drugs.  
5.1.2  Use Time/Stability  
 
Once  transferred  to IV bags,  the solution  may be stored  for up to [ADDRESS_1125849]  administration  period.   Please  refer to the current  
Investigator  Brochure  for further  details  (Section  3).

Administrative Update 3 : [ADDRESS_1125850] scans  will be obtained  at the time of treatment  delivery,  and 
intensity  modulated  radiotherapy  planning  (IMRT)  will be utilized.  
IMRT  is a sophisticated  radiation  planning  and delivery  technique  that uses a computer  
controlled  multi-leaf collimator  to shape  the intensity  of each  radiation  treatment  beam  to 
optimally  deliver  the dose  to the tumor  and protect  normal  tissue.   The radiotherapy  
delivery  systems that will be used  in this trial are standard  and FDA approved.   The dose  
fractionation  scheme  (9 Gy x 3) has been  used  routinely  at MSKCC  and other  tertiary  care 
centers.

 7.0 RECRUITMENT  PLAN  
 
Potential  research  subjects  will be identified  by a member  of the patient’s  head  and neck 
treatment  team,  the site protocol  investigator,  or research  team  at Memorial  Sloan -Kettering  
Cancer  Center  (MSKCC).   If the investigator  is a member  of the treatment  team,  s/he will screen  
their patient’s  medical  records  for suitable  research  study  participants  and discuss  the study  and 
their potential  for enrolling  in the research  study.   Potential  subjects  contact[CONTACT_813034]/research  staff of the study.  
The site principal  investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_232937] a treatment  relationship  for the limited  purpose  of identifying  patients  who would  be 
eligible  to enroll  in the study  and to record  appropriate  contact  [CONTACT_636727].  
During  the initial  conversation  between  the investigator/research  staff and the patient,  the patient  
may be asked  to provide  certain  health  information  that is necessary  to the recruitment  and 
enrollment  process.  The investigator/research  staff may also review  portions  of their medical  
records  at MSKCC  in order  to further  assess eligibility.   They  will use the information  provided  by 
[CONTACT_17491]/or  medical  record  to confirm  that the patient  is eligible  and to contact  [CONTACT_500758].  
In most  cases,  the initial  contact  [CONTACT_46444],  investigator  or the research  staff working  in consultation  with the treatment  team.  
The recruitment  process  outlined  presents  no more  than minimal  risk to the privacy  of the patients  
who are screened  and minimal  PHI will be maintained  as part of a screening  log.  For these  
reasons,  we seek a (partial)  limited  waiver  of authorization  for the purposes  of (1) reviewing  
medical  records  to identify  potential  research  subjects  and obtain  information  relevant  to the 
enrollment  process;  (2) conversing  with patients  regarding  possible  enrollment;  (3) handling  of 
PHI contained  within  those  records  and provided  by [CONTACT_28632];  and (4) maintaining  
information  in a screening  log of patients  approached  (if applicable).  
 
This limited  waiver  will apply  only to MSK.

9.2 Intervention:  Nivolumab  
 
9.2.1  Preparation and Administration: 
 
• Nivolumab  injection  is to be administered  using  a volumetric  pump  with a 0.2/1.2  
micron  pore size, low protein  binding  polyethersulfone  membrane  in-line filter at 
the protocol -specific  doses.  
• The line should  be flushed  at the end of the infusion  with sufficient  quantity  of 
normal  saline  per institution  SOC.  
• Nivolumab  is not to be administered  as an IV push  or bolus  injection.  
• At the dose  of 3mg/kg,  the total dose  needed  will be diluted  to a minimum  total 
volume  of 60 ml in 0.9%  Sodium  Chloride  or 5% dextrose  injection  solution.  
• Care  must  be taken  to assure  sterility  of the prepared  solution  as the produce  not 
contain  any anti-microbial  preservative  or bacteriostatic  agent.  
• Nivolumab  should  be administered  over a 1-hour period;  infusions  will be 
controlled  by a volumetric  pump.  
• Please  refer to the current  Investigator  Brochure  for further  details.  
• Allow  the appropriate  number  of vials of Nivolumab  to stand  at room  temperature  
for approximately  5 minutes  before  preparation.  
• Ensure  that Nivolumab  solution  is clear,  colorless,  and essentially  free from 
particulate  matter.  
• Aseptically  withdraw  the require  volume  of Nivolumab  into a syringe  and dispense  
into an IV bag. 
a. Add the appropriate  volume  of 0.9%  Sodium  Chloride  injection  solution.

institutional  guidelines.    There  are no pre-medications  recommended  for Nivolumab.  
9.2 Intervention:  SBRT  
 
9.2.1  Target  Selection  
 
• A single  target  lesion  will be selected.  
• The lesion  must  be safely  amenable  to irradiation  in the judgment  of the treating  
radiation  oncologist;  approval  of PI [CONTACT_191162].  
• Lesions  must  be located  in one of the following  eight locations:  
▪ Central  Lung  Tumors:  GTVs  within  2cm of the proximal  bronchial  tree 
(carina,  right and left main  bronchia,  right and left upper  lobe bronchi,  
intermedius  bronchus,  right middle  lobe bronchus,  lingular  bronchus  right 
and left lower  lobe bronchi.  
▪ Lung  Peripheral:  metastases  within  the lung parenchyma  with GTV outside  
of the proximal  bronchial  tree as described  above.  
▪ Mediastinal  Lymph  Nodes:  GTV arising  within  the anatomic  space  between  
the lungs,  above  the diaphragm,  and below  the thoracic  inlet at the level of 
the top of the sterna  notch.  
▪ Head  and Neck:  GTV occurring  within  cervical  lymph  node  levels  I-VI 
and/or  retropharyngeal  spaces,  oral cavity,  oropharynx,  nasopharynx,  
hypopharynx,  para-nasal  sinuses,  nasal  cavity,  and parotid  gland/space.  
▪ Liver:  GTV arising  within  the liver. 
▪ Spi[INVESTIGATOR_050]:  metastases  will be assigned  to the spi[INVESTIGATOR_1304]/paraspi[INVESTIGATOR_812997] 1cm.  
▪ Osseous:  GTV arising  within  an osseous  structure,  part of the axial 
skeleton,  not included  in the spi[INVESTIGATOR_812998].  
▪ Abdominal -Pelvic:  GTV arising  within  the anatomic  space  defined  by [CONTACT_813037],  the genitourinary  diaphragm  inferiorly  include  the 
peritoneal  and retroperitoneal  spaces,  not including  liver, osseous,  or spi[INVESTIGATOR_812999].  
 
• While  no specific  size constraint  exists,  the treating  radiation  oncologist  must  have 
a reasonable  expectation  that the dose  constraints  outlined  in the appendix  will be 
met; if, during  planning,  dose  constraints  to outlined  normal  tissue  structures  are 
exceeded,  the treating  radiation  oncologist  must  receive  permission  of the study  PI 
(Sean  McBride)  prior to proceeding  with treatment.  If permission  is not obtained,  
the patient  will be withdrawn  from the study.  
• In instances  where  there  is a metastatic  or recurrent  lesion  that is either  causing  
symptoms  or on the precipi[INVESTIGATOR_813000], the treating  radiation  oncologist  should  
select  this lesion  for irradiation.  
• Every  effort  should  be made  to choose  a target  lesion  outside  of a previously  
irradiated  site.  However,  the treated  lesion  can be a lesion  that was previously

fraction  of SBRT  and as long as re-irradiation  dose  constraints  as outlined  in 
appendix  are met. In cases  of re-irradiation,  if the re-irradiation  dose  constraints  
outlined  in the appendix  are exceeded,  the patient  will be withdrawn  from the 
study.  
9.2.2  Radiotherapy  Simulation  and Contouring  Guidelines  
 
• All patients  will undergo  standard  IMRT -based  treatment  planning  (VMAT   allowed)  
prior to the first treatment  using  an appropriate  immobilization  device.  
o Begins  with immobilization  of the patient  in a reproducible  position  in a 
custom -mold  followed  by [CONTACT_813038] a CT scan  in the treatment  planning  
position.   Prior placement  of fiducial  markers  and the use of 4D-CT 
acquisition  is at the discretion  of the treating  radiation  oncologist.  
o The use of intravenous,  oral, or rectal  contrast  is at the discretion  of the 
treating  radiation  oncologist.  
o The physician  segments  the tumor  and critical  normal  tissues  on the scan  
and also specifies  the dosimetric  goals.  
o For spi[INVESTIGATOR_813001],  MR fusion  or CT myelogram  prior to CT simulation  
will be required  in order  to ensure  that the spi[INVESTIGATOR_813002].  
• The definition  of volumes  will be in accordance  with ICRU  Report  #50: Prescribing,  
Recording,  and Reporting  Photon  Beam  Therapy.  
o A gross  tumor  volume  will be entered  for the lesion  (GTV),  based  on 
available  imaging  data.  
o The clinical  target  volume  (CTV)  should  be the same  as the GTV.   No 
margin  is required  for microscopic  extension.  
o An internal  target  volume  (ITV) can be used  at the discretion  of the treating  
radiation  oncologist.  
o The planning  target  volume  (PTV)  should  be the GTV (or ITV) plus [ADDRESS_1125873],  liver, kidney,  heart,  trachea,  esophagus,  rectum,  
bladder,  and bowel,  if applicable.  
9.2.3  Radiotherapy Planning  and Treatment Delivery  
 
• Planning:  
o For IMRT -planning,   a physicist  chooses  the most  favorable  beam  directions  
and inputs  the treatment  goals  into a computer  algorithm  that designs  the 
intensity  patterns  to best fulfill the goals  of delivering  the assigned  dose  to 
the target  while  keepi[INVESTIGATOR_813003].   The intensity  patterns  are 
then downloaded  to the treatment  machine  to drive the multi-leaf collimator  
during  treatment.

 o The patient  immobilization  device  is itself fixed to the couch  of the 
treatment  machine.  
o Prior to each  treatment,  the position  of the patient’s  tumor  is verified  using  [ADDRESS_1125874]  
position  corresponding  to the designed  IMRT  treatment  plan so that the 
prescription  dose  completely  encompasses  the target  and the critical  
normal  tissues  are not within  the high dose  region.  
• Once  the patient’s  correct  position  is confirmed,  the treatment  will be delivered.  
During  treatment  the patient  is monitored  carefully  to assure  that there  is no 
motion;  if motion  is noted,  further  imaging  may be warranted.

10.1.2  Efficacy  Assessments  
 
o Tumor  Assessment:   tumor  assessments  of non-irradiated  lesions  via CT or MRI of all 
known  sites of disease  should  occur  8 weeks  after treatment  initiation  (day 1) (+/-2 weeks)  
and then every  8 weeks  (+/- 2 weeks)  for the first 48 weeks  and every  12 weeks  (+/- 2 
weeks)  until progression  or week  96 (whichever  occurs  first).   At each  time-point,  subjects  
should  have CT/MR  of neck,  chest,  abdomen,  and pelvis  with contrast.  Subjects  with a 
history  of brain  metastasis  should  have surveillance  MRI per the above  schedule  or  
sooner  if clinically  indicated.   If additional  sites of disease  not encompassed  by [CONTACT_813039],  imaging  of these  lesions  should  also occur  at the study  mandated  time 
points.  
Both MRI and contrast  enhanced  CTs are adequate  imaging  modalities  for this study.  CT with 
contrast  or MR of the neck,  chest,  abdomen,  pelvis,  and all other  known  sites of disease  are to be 
performed  for tumor  assessments  per the timing  above.  
CT scans should  be acquired  with 5mm slices  with no intervening  gap.  A non-contrast  CT of the 
chest  and a contrast  enhanced  MRI of the abdomen  are acceptable  if the patient  has a 
contraindication  to CT with contrast.  
PET/CT  is acceptable  so long as the CT component  is of diagnostic  quality.  
MRI brain  scans during  on-study  treatment  are required  if there  is a prior history  of lesions  
present  at screening,  or as clinically  indicated.  
 
10.1.3  Outcomes  Research  Assessment  
• EORTC  QLQ -C-30: will be completed  on or before  Day 1 of treatment,  and then,  starting  
at week  8 (+/- 2 weeks),  every  8 weeks  (+/-2 weeks)  for the first 48 weeks  and every  12 
weeks  (+/- 2 weeks)  until either  week  96 or disease  progression  (whichever  occurs  first).  
10.1.4  Exploratory  Biomarker  Testing  
 
o PBMC  composition:   should  be evaluated  on blood  drawn  up to 7 days prior to treatment  
and then Days  14 (+/- 3 days)   and 28 (+/-3 days)  and then upon  progression  (within  1 
week).  
o Soluble  Biomarkers:  can include  PD-L1, and PD-1.  should  be evaluated  on blood  drawn  
up to 7 days prior to treatment  and then Days  14 (+/- 3 days)   and 28 (+/- 3 days)and  then 
upon  progression  (within  1 week).

using  the CTCAE  v 4.0.  All grade  1-5 adverse  events  should  be reported  and attributed.  
The causal  relationship  to study  drug is determined  by [CONTACT_813040].  The causal  relationships  are defined  as follows:  
• Related:  there  is a reasonable  causal  relationship  between  study  drug/radiation  
administration  and the AE. 
• Not related:   there  is not a reasonable  causal  relationship  between  study  drug/radiation  
administration  and the AE. 
The common  understood  meaning  of “reasonable  causal  relationship”  is that there  is evidence  to 
suggest  a causal  relationship.

11.1.2  Management Algorithms  for Immuno-Oncology Agents 
 
Immuno -Oncology  (I-0) agents  are associated  with adverse  events  that can differ  in 
severity  and duration  than adverse  events  caused  by [CONTACT_813041].  
Nivolumab  is considered  an immune -oncology  agent  in this protocol.   Early  recognition  
and management  of adverse  events  associated  with immune -oncology  agents  may 
mitigate  severe  toxicity.   Management  algorithms  have been  developed  to assist  
investigators  in assessing  and managing  the following  groups  of adverse  events:  
• Gastrointestinal  
• Renal  
• Pulmonary  
• Hepatic  
• Endocrinopathies  
• Skin 
• Neurological

infusion  reacitons  should  be reported  within  24 hours  to the primary  investigator  and 
reported  as an SAE if criteria  are met.  Infusion  reactions  should  be graded  according  to 
NCI CTCAE  v 4.0 guidelines.  
Treatment  recommendations  are provided   below   and may be  modified  based  on  local 
treatment  standards  and guidelines  as appropriate:  
For Grade  1 symptoms:   (Mild reaction;  infusion  interruption  not indicated;  intervention  not 
indicated)  
Remain  at bedside  and monitor  subject  until recovery  from symptoms.  The following  
prophylactic  premedications  are recommended  for future  infusions:  diphenhydramine  50 mg 
(or equivalent)  and/or  paracetamol  325 to 1000  mg (acetaminophen)  at least 30 minutes  
before  additional  Nivolumab  administrations.  
For Grade  2 symptoms : (Moderate  reaction  requires  therapy  or infusion  interruption  but 
responds  promptly  to symptomatic  treatment  [e.g.,  antihistamines,  non-steroidal  anti 
inflammatory  drugs,  narcotics,  corticosteroids,  bronchodilators,  IV fluids];  prophylactic  
medications  indicated  for 24 hours).  
Stop the Nivolumab  infusion,  begin  an IV infusion  of normal  saline,  and treat the subject  
with diphenhydramine  50 mg IV (or equivalent)  and/or  paracetamol  325 to 1000  mg 
(acetaminophen);  remain  at bedside  and monitor  subject  until resolution  of symptoms.  
Corticosteroid  or bronchodilator  therapy  may also be administered  as appropriate.  If the 
infusion  is interrupted,  then restart  the infusion  at 50% of the original  infusion  rate when  
symptoms  resolve;  if no further  complications  ensue  after 30 minutes,  the rate may be 
increased  to 100%  of the original  infusion  rate. Monitor  subject  closely.  If symptoms recur  
then no further  Nivolumab  will be administered  at that visit. Administer  diphenhydramine  [ADDRESS_1125891]  be recorded  on the electronic  case  report  form (eCRF).  
The following  prophylactic  premedications  are recommended  for future  infusions:  
diphenhydramine  50 mg (or equivalent)  and/or  paracetamol  325 to 1000  mg 
(acetaminophen)  should  be administered  at least 30 minutes  before  additional  Nivolumab  
administrations.  If necessary,  corticosteroids  (recommended  dose:  up to 25 mg of IV

 For Grade  3 or Grade  4 symptoms:   (Severe  reaction,  Grade  3: prolonged  [i.e., not rapi[INVESTIGATOR_813004]/or  brief interruption  of infusion];  recurrence  of 
symptoms  following  initial  improvement;  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_426931]  
[e.g.,  renal  impairment,  pulmonary  infiltrates]).  Grade  4: (life threatening;  pressor  or

Immediately  discontinue  infusion  of Nivolumab.  Begin  an IV infusion  of normal  saline,  and 
treat the subject  as follows.  Recommend  bronchodilators,  epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]  0.2 to 1 mg of a 
1:1,000  solution  for subcutaneous  administration  or 0.1 to 0.25 mg of a 1:10,000  solution  
injected  slowly  for IV administration,  and/or  diphenhydramine  50 mg IV with 
methylprednisolone  100 mg IV (or equivalent),  as needed.  Subject  should  be monitored  until 
the investigator  is comfortable  that the symptoms  will not recur.  Nivolumab  will be 
permanently  discontinued.  Investigators  should  follow  their institutional  guidelines  for the 
treatment  of anaphylaxis.  Remain  at bedside  and monitor  subject  until recovery  from 
symptoms.  In the case  of late-occurring  hypersensitivity  symptoms  (e.g.,  appearance  of a 
localized  or generalized  pruritus  within  1 week  after treatment),  symptomatic  treatment  may 
be given  (e.g.,  oral antihistamine,  or corticosteroids).

12.0 CRITERIA  FOR THERAPEUTIC  RESPONSE/OUTCOME  ASSESSMENT  
 
12.1 Primary  Endpoint:  
To compare  overall  response  rate (ORR)  in non irradiated  lesions  during  the first 96 
weeks  after treatment  initiation  as determined  by [CONTACT_813042]  (RECIST)  1.[ADDRESS_1125893] overall  response  (BOR)  of 
complete  response  (CR)  or partial  response  (PR) divided  by [CONTACT_813043]. 
To serially  evaluate  tumor  response  to therapy,  it is necessary  to estimate  the overall  
tumor  burden  at baseline  and use this as a comparator  for subsequent  measurements.  
Measurable  disease  is defined  by [CONTACT_813044].  
At baseline,  tumor  lesions/lymph  nodes  will be categorized  as measurable  or 
nonmeasurable.  
 
12.1.1  Measurable  Lesions  
 
Of note,  for purposes  of this study,  irradiated  lesions  are not considered  measurable.

IRB Number: 15 -253 A(11)  
Approval date: 13 -Mar-2018 
Administrative Update 3 : [ADDRESS_1125894] one dimension  (longest  
diameter  in the plane  of the measurement  to be recorded)  with a minimum  size of: 
 
o 10mm  by [CONTACT_4654]/MRI  scan  
o Malignant   lymph  nodes:  to be considered  pathologically  enlarged  and measurable,  
a lymph  node  must  be >= [ADDRESS_1125895] scan.  At 
baseline  and in follow -up, only the short  axis will be measured  and followed.  
12.1.2  Non-measurable  lesions  
 
o All other  lesions  including  small  lesions  (longest  diameter  <10mm  or pathological  
lymph  nodes  with >=10  to <15mm  short  axis),  as well as truly non-measurable  
lesions.  
o Lesions  considered  to be truly nonmeasurable  include:  leptomeningeal  disease,  
ascites,  pleural  or pericardial  effusion,  inflammatory  breast  disease,  lymphangitic  
involvement  of skin or lung. 
 
12.1.[ADDRESS_1125896]/MRI  can be considered  as measurable  lesions  if the SOFT  TISSUE  component  
meets  the definition  of measurability.  
o Blastic  bone  lesions  are non-measurable.  
 
12.1.4  Cystic  Lesions  
 
o Lesions  that meet  the criteria  for radiographically  defined  simple  cysts  should  not 
be considered  as malignant  lesions  since  they are, by [CONTACT_813045].  
o “Cystic  lesions”  thoug ht to represent  cystic  metastases  can be considered  as 
measurable  lesions,  if they meet  the aforementioned  definition  of measurability.  
However,  non-cystic  lesions  are preferred.  
 
12.1.5  Lesions  with Prior Local  Treatment  
 
o Tumor  lesions  situated  in the previously  irradiated  area can be included  as target  
lesions  as long as there  is documented  radiographic  disease  progression  in that 
site after completion  of radiotherapy.  
 
12.1.6  Baseline  Documentation  of “Target”  and “Non-Target”  Lesions  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Target  Lesions  
 
When  more  than one measurable  lesion  is present  at baseline  all lesions  up to a 
maximum  of five lesions  total representative  of all involved  organs  should  be identified  as 
target  lesions  and will be recorded  and measured  at baseline.

IRB Number: 15 -253 A(11)  
Approval date: 13 -Mar-2018 
Administrative Update 3 : 17 -Mar-2020   
 Target  lesions  should  be selected  on the basis  of their size, be representative  of all 
involved  organs,  and should  lend themselves  to reproducible  repeated  measurements.  
 
A sum of diameters  (longest  for non-nodal  lesions,  short  axis for nodal  lesions)  for all 
target  lesions  will be calculated  and reported  as the baseline  sum diameters.   If lymph  
nodes  are to be included  in the sum,  then as noted  below,  only the short  axis is added  into 
the sum.  The baseline  sum diameters  will be used  as reference  to further  characterize  
any objective  tumor  regression  in the measurable  dimension  of the disease.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Non-Target  Lesions  
 
All other  lesions  (or sites of disease)  including  pathological  lymph  nodes  should  be 
identified  as non-target  lesions  and should  be recorded  at baseline.   Measurements  are 
NOT required  and these  lesions  should  be followed  as “present”,  “absent”,  or in rare 
cases,  “unequivocal  progression”.   In addition,  it is possible  to record  multiple  non-target  
lesions  involving  the same  organ  as a single  item on the case  record  form.  
 
12.1.7  Tumor  Response  Evaluation  
 
Complete  Response  (CR):  disappearance  of all target  lesions.  Any pathological  lymph  
nodes  must  have reduction  in short  axis to <10mm.  
Partial  Response  (PR):  at least a 30% decrease  in the sum of diameters  of target  lesions,  
taking  as a reference  the baseline  sum of diameters.  
Progressive  Disease  (PD):  at least a 20% increase  in the sum of diameters  of target  
lesions,  taking  as a reference  the smallest  sum on study  (this includes  the baseline  sum if 
that is the smallest  on study).  IN addition  the relative  increase  of 20%,  the sum must  also 
demonstrate  an absolute  increase  of at least 5mm.  Note:  the appearanc  e of one or more  
new lesions  is also considered  progression.  
Stable  Disease  (SD):  neither  sufficient  shrinkage  to qualify  for PR nor sufficient  increase  
to qualify  for PD, taking  as a reference  the smallest  sum diameters  while  on study.  
12.1.8  Evaluation  of Non-Target  Lesions  
 
While  some  non-target  lesions  may actually  be measurable,  they need  not be measured  
and instead  should  be assessed  only qualitatively  at the time points  specified.  
Complete  Response  (CR):  disappearance  of all non-target  lesions.   All lymph  nodes  must  
be non-pathological  in size (<10mm  short  axis).  
Non-CR/Non -PD: persistence  of one or more  non-target  lesions.  
 
Progressive  Disease:  unequivocal  progression  of existing  non-target  lesions  (Note:  the 
appearance  of one or more  new lesions  is also considered  progression)  or the 
appearance  of new malignant  lesions.   The finding  of new lesions  should  be unequivocal.  
Page  44 of 64 Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 15 -253 A(11)  
Approval date: 13 -Mar-2018 
Administrative Update 3 : [ADDRESS_1125897]  “increase”  in the size of one or more  non-target  lesions  is usually  not 
sufficient  to qualify  for unequivocal  progression  status.  
o If unequivocal  progression  is seen,  the subject  should  be considered  to have had 
an overall  PD at that point.  
 
FDG-PET Evaluation  
 
While  FDG-PET response  assessments  need  additional  study,  it is sometimes  reasonable  
to incorporate  the use of qualitative  assessment  of FDG -PET scanning  to complement  CT 
scanning  in assessment  of progression,  particularly  new disease.  New lesions  on the  
basis  of FDG-PET imaging  can be identified  according  to the following  algorithm.  
o Negative  FDG-PET at baseline  with a positive  FDG -PET at follow -up is a sign of 
PD based  on a new lesion.  
o No FDG-PET at baseline  and a positive  FDG -PET at follow -up: 
o If positive  PET at follow -up corresponds  to new site of disease,  this is PD 
o IF the positive  PET at follow -up is not confirmed  as a new site of disease  
on CT, additional  follow -up CT scans are needed  to determine  if there  is 
truly progression  occurring  at that site. 
o If the positive  PET at follow -up corresponds  to a pre-existing  site of disease  
on CT that is not progressing  on the basis  of the anatomic  images,  this is 
not PD.

12.1.10  Verification  Scans  
 
o Verification  of Response:  confirmation  of response  (CR or PR) is required.  
Confirmed  CR or PR will be claimed  only if the criteria  for each  are met at a 
subsequent  time point (minimum  [ADDRESS_1125900] met).  
o Verification  of Progression:  progression  of disease  should  be verified  in cases  
where  progression  is equivocal.   If repeat  scans  confirm  PD, then progression  
should  be declared  using  the date of the initial  scan.  If repeat  scans  do not confirm  
PD, then the subject  is considered  not to have progressive  disease  per RECIST

PFS is defined  as the time from randomization  to the date of RECIST -defined  progressive  
disease  (PD) or death  from any cause.  For subjects  that are alive with CR, PR, or SD, 
they will be censored  at the end of the two year,  study  mandated  tumor  assessments.

functional  scales  (physical  functioning,  cognitive  functioning,  emotional  functioning,  social  
functioning,  role functioning,  and global  quality -of-life) as well as nine symptom  scales  
(fatigue,  pain, nausea/vomiting,  dyspnea,  insomnia,  appetite  loss, constipation,  diarrhea,  
and financial  difficulties).   Except  for overall  health  status  and global  quality  of life items,  
responses  for all items  are 4-point categorical  scales ranging  from 1 (not at all) to 4 (very  
much).  The overall  health/quality  of life responses  are [ADDRESS_1125904] 10 points  (on a 0-100 scale).   For example,  a mean  increase  of >= 
10 points  on a functional  scale  would  indicated  a moderate  improvement,  whereas  a mean

12.3.1  Baseline  PD-L1 Expression  on Tumor  Cells  
 
Fresh  biopsies  will be provided  for biomarker  analysis  if accessible  and deemed  safe and 
clinically  necessary  by [CONTACT_093].   An archived  biopsy  of metastatic  or loco- 
regionally  recurrent  disease  obtained  prior to therapy  is acceptable  if the fresh  biopsy  is 
not clinically  indicated.  If neither  fresh  nor archived  material  are available  from 
recurrent/metastatic  site, archived  material  from the primary  disease  at diagnosis  is 
allowable  with permission  of PI. On-treatment  biopsies  are not required.  
Expression  of PD-L1 expression  on tumor  cells will be assessed  using  an automated  
immunohistochemical  assay  developed  by [CONTACT_813046].   PD-L1 positivity  will be 
defined  as at least 5% of tumor  cells showing  cell surface  PD-L1 staining  of any intensity  
in a section  containing  at least 100 tumor  cells that could  be evaluated.  Expression  of 
PD-L2 expression  on tumor  infiltrating  lymphocytes  (TILs)  may also be assessed.  
Additional  IHC studies  may be conducted  evaluating  CD4,  CD8,  FOXP3,  HLA Class  I,

be conducted  by [CONTACT_20444] (see appendix  for additional  information)  
12.3.2  Peripheral  Blood  Mononuclear  Cells  Composition  (PBMCs) 
Peripheral  blood  samples  will be taken  prior to initiation  of study  therapy  and at designated  
time points.   Ideally,   peripheral  blood  samples  should  be used  for immunophenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_813005],  including,  but not limited  to, T 
cells,  B cells,  NK cells,  or subpopulations  of the aforementioned  immune  cell types.  
These  samples  may also be used  to assess  immune  cell function  or antigen  specific  T cell 
proliferation.

storage.   Samples  may be assessed  by [CONTACT_6428],  seromics  and/or  other  relevant  multiplex  
based  protein  assay  methods  for immune  or HNSCC -related  factors  that will predict  for 
Nivolumab  and/or  Nivolumab+SBRT  benefit.   Although  numerous  potential  serum  -based  
biomarkers  are under  investigation,  we will look at soluble  PD-[ADDRESS_1125906]  and future  analyses  may include  them.

 ▪ Any drug related  LFT abnormaltiy  that meets  the following  criteria  require  
discontinuation;  
• AST or ALT > 8x ULN 
• Total  bilirubin  > 5x ULN 
• Concurrent  AST or ALT > [ADDRESS_1125908] and total bilirubin  > [ADDRESS_1125909].  
• Any grade  4 drug-related  adverse  event  or laboratory  abnormaltiy,  except  for the following  
events  which  do NOT require  discontinuation:  
o Isolated  grade  4 electrolyte  imbalances  that are not associated  with clinical  
sequelae  and are corrected  with supplementation/appropriate  management  within  
72 hours  of their onset.  
o Isolated  grade  4 electrolyte  imbalances  that are not associated  with clinical  
sequelae  and are corrected  with supplementation  within  72 hours  of their onset.  
• Any dosing  delays  lasting  > 6 weeks  with the following  exceptions:  
o Dosing  delays  to allow  for prolonged  steroid  tapers  to manage  drug-related  adverse  
events  are allowed.   Prior to reinitiating  treatment  in a subject  with a dosing  delay  
lasting  > [ADDRESS_1125910]  be consulted.  Tumor  assessments  
should  continue  as per protocol  even if dosing  is delayed.  
o Dosing  delays  > [ADDRESS_1125911]  with 
a dosing  delay  lasting  > [ADDRESS_1125912]  be consulted.  
Tumor  assessments  should  continue  as perp protocol  even if dosing  is delayed.  
• Any adverse  event,  laboratory  abnormality,  or intercurrent  illness  which,  in the judgement  of 
the investigator,  presents  a substantial  clinical  risk to the subject  with continued  Nivolumab  
dosing.  
13.3 Treatment Beyond  Disease  Progression  with Nivolumab  
 
Accumulating  evidence  indicates  a minority  of subjects  treated  with immunotherapy  may 
derive  clinical  benefit  despi[INVESTIGATOR_813009]  (PD).  Subjects  will be 
permitted  to continue  on treatment  with Nivolumab  beyond  initial  RECIST  1.1 PD as long 
as they are meeting  the following  criteria:  
• Investigator -assessed  clinical  benefit  without  rapid  disease  progression.  
• Tolerance  of study  drug 
• Stable  performance  status  
• Treatment  beyond  progression  will not delay  an imminent  intervention  to prevent  
serious  complications  of disease  progression  (e.g. CNS metastases)  
• Subject  provides  written  informed  consent  prior to receiving  any additional  
nivolumab  treatment,  using  an ICF describing  any reasonably  forseeable  risks or 
discomforts,  or other  alterative  treatment  options.  
The assessment  of clinical  benefit  should  take into account  whether  the subject  is clinically  
deteriorating  and unlikely  to receive  further  benefit  from continued  treatment.

IRB Number: 15 -253 A(11)  
Approval date: 13 -Mar-2018 
Administrative Update 3 : [ADDRESS_1125913]  be discussed  with the 
primary  investigator  and documented  in the study  records.  Subjects  will be reconsented  
with an ICF describing  any reasonable  foreseeable  risks or discomforts.  
Subjects  should  discontinue  study  therapy  upon  further  evidence  of progression,  defined  
as an additional  10% or greater  increase  in tumor  burden  volume  from time of initial  
progression.  
New lesions  are considered  measurable  at the time of initial  progression  if the longest  
diameter  is at least 10mm  (except  for pathological  lymph  nodes,  which   must  have a short  
axis of at least 15mm).  Any new lesion  considered  non-measurable  at the time of initial  
progression  may become  measurable  and therefore  included  in the tumor  burden  
measurement  if the longest  diameter  increases  to at least 10 mm (except  for pathological  
lymph  nodes  which  must  have an increase  in short  axis to at least 15mm).  
For statistical  analyses  that include  investigator  assessed  progression  date,  subjects  who 
continue  treatment  beyond  initial  investigator -assessed  RECIST  1.[ADDRESS_1125914] overall  response  (BOR)  rate by [ADDRESS_1125915] overall  response  
of complete  response  (CR)  or partial  response  (PR) of non-irradiated  lesions  divided  by 
[CONTACT_813047]. In order  to ascertain  this 
endpoint,  efforts  will be made  so that patients  will be followed  for 96 weeks  or until 
progression  of disease  (and treatment  cessation),  whichever  comes  first. 
 
Based  upon  an estimated  ORR  of 15% in a PD-L1 unselected  population  in the Nivolumab  
alone  arm (based  on data from Siewert,  et al; see background)  and an ORR  of 45% in the 
Nivolumab  and SBRT  arm, the enrollment  of [ADDRESS_1125916] 
will provide  a one-sided  alpha  of 0.10 and a power  of 0.80.   Assuming  a 10% drop-out 
rate, we will enroll  a total of 60 patients.  Patients  will be randomized  to the two treatment  
arms  in a 1:1 ratio.   Patients  will be stratified  based  upon  viral status  (virus  negative   
versus  virus positive;  virus status  is defined  by [CONTACT_322891] (EBER  testing)  or HPV (p16,  HPV 
ISH, HPV PCR)  testing).   Assuming  a constant  enrollment  of [ADDRESS_1125917]  6.

Administrative Update 3 : [ADDRESS_1125918] to follow -up prior to 6 months  (24 week  scan)  
will be replaced,  regardless  of response.  Patients  lost to follow -up between  6 months  and 
24 months  will be included  in the ORR  calculation.  
 
Secondary  objectives:  
 
 
OS and PFS will be evaluated  by [CONTACT_813048] -Meier  
and competing  risks methods.  Comparisons  will be conducted  between  the two arms  by 
[CONTACT_813049]-rank test and Gray’s  test. 
 
The DOR  will be calculated  from the time of response  to progression  or last follow  up and 
analyzed  using  the Kaplan -Meier   method  among  patients  who showed  response.  
 
 
All tr-AEs will be tabulated  and summarized.  The cumulative  incidence  of all tr-AEs and 
Grade  3+ tr-AEs, etc., will be compared  between  the two arms by [CONTACT_813050]’s  test. For 
this analysis  all randomized  subjects  who received  at least one dose  of study  drug will be 
included.  
 
The questions  on the HRQOL  will be scaled  and scored  using  the recommended  EORTC  
Quality  of Life Group  procedures.  Raw scores  will be transformed  using  a linear  scale  
ranging  from [ADDRESS_1125919]  later 
patients  from unacceptably  high toxicity  rate. Using  data from recently  reported  early  
phase  trials of Nivolumab  in NSCLC,  we view 14% as an acceptable  rate of acute  (within  3 
months  of study  initiation)  >= Grade  3 treatment -related  adverse  events;  an unacceptable  
rate of acute  >= Grade  3 treatment -related  adverse  events  is 30%.  If more  than 5 (e.g. 6  
or more)  of the first 20 patients  experience  an acute  >= Grade  3 treatment -related  adverse  
event,  the trial will be stopped  early.  If the true toxicity  rate is 30%,  the above  boundary  
assures a 58% probability  of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_812991];  if the true toxicity  rate is 
40%,  there  is an 87% chance  of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_812992].  If the true toxicity  rate is 14%,  the 
above  boundary  has only a 5% probability  of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_812992].  Of note,  for radiation  
dermatitis,  only Grade  [ADDRESS_1125920]  for response  to Nivolumab.

To clarify  we define  population  for the above  analyses  
o Randomized  subjects  for ORR  analysis:  all enrolled  subjects  who were  
randomized  and provided  at least 6 months  of follow -up after treatment  initiation.  
This is the dataset  for the primary  objective  and irORR.  
o All randomized  subjects:  all enrolled  subjects  who were  randomized.   This is the 
dataset  for baseline  demographics  and time-to-event  endpoints  (PFS,  OS). 
o Treated  subjects:   all randomized  subjects  who received  at least one dose  of study  
drug.   This is the dataset  for safety  evaluation.   For instance,  if a subject  receives  a 
single  dose  of Nivolumab  but withdraws  from study  prior to the first dose  of 
radiation,  that subject  will be considered  treated.  
o Biomarker  Subjects:  all randomized  subjects  with available  biomarker  data.  
o PRO  subjects:  all subjects  with available  Patient  Reported  Outcomes  (PRO)  data.  
 
15.1 RESEARCH PARTICIPANT REGISTRATION AND RANDOMIZATION PROCEDUR ES 
 
15.2 Research  Participant  Registration  
 
Confirm  eligibility  as defined  in the section  entitled  Criteria  for Patient/Subject  Eligibility.  
 
Obtain  informed  consent,  by [CONTACT_40136].  
During  the registration  process  registering  individuals  will be required  to complete  a 
protocol  specific  Eligibility  Checklist.  
All participants  must  be registered  through  the Protocol  Participant  Registration  (PPR)  
Office  at Memorial  Sloan  Kettering  Cancer  Center.  PPR is available  Monday  through  
Friday  from 8:30am  – 5:30pm  at [PHONE_214].  Registrations  must  be submitted  via the

15.3 Randomization  
 
Patients  will be randomized  to the Nivolumab  and SBRT  arm or Nivolumab  only arm. For 
patients  enrolled,  immediately  after consent  is obtained,  the RSA at MSKCC  will register  
participants  in the Protocol  Participant  Registration  (PPR)  system.  Once  the participant’s  
eligibility  is established  the registration  will be finalized  and the participants  will be 
randomized  using  the Clinical  Research  Database  (CRDB).  Randomization  will be 
accomplished  by [CONTACT_206951],  and will be stratified  by [CONTACT_813051]  (positive  or negative ). After treatment  arm is determined  by [CONTACT_17628],  RSAs  
will notify  the physicians  at MSKCC  of the treatment  arm and participant  ID via email  
within  24 hours  of randomization.  All Data will be collected  and analyzed  at MSKCC.

• Patient  demographic  data (date  of birth,  height,  weight)  
• Medical  history  
• Concomitant  medication  
• Adverse  events  
• Laboratory  Values  
• Tumor  Assessment  Data 
• Quality  of Life Assessment  Data 
• Tumor  PD-L1 status  
• MDSC  results  
 
16.2 Quality Assurance 
 
Routine  data-quality  reports  will be generated  to assess  missing  data and inconsistencies.   
Accrual  rates,  and extent  and accuracy  of evaluations  and follow -up, will be monitored  periodically  
throughout  the study  period  and potential  problems  will be brought  to the attention  of the study  
team  for discussion  and action.  
Random -sample  data quality  and protocol  compliance  audits  will be conducted  by [CONTACT_2362],  
at a minimum  of once  per year,  more  frequently  if indicated.  
 
 
 
16.3 Data  and Safety  Monitoring  
 
The Data and Safety  Monitoring  (DSM)  Plans  at MSKCC  were  approved  by [CONTACT_594723]  2001.  The plans  address  the new policies  set forth by [CONTACT_633147]  “Policy  of the National  Cancer  Institute  for Data and Safety Monitoring  of 
Clinical  Trials”  which  can be found  at http://deainfo.nci.nih.gov/grantspolicies/datasafety.htm.  
The DSM Plans  at MSKCC  were  established  and are monitored  by [CONTACT_232985].  The MSKCC  Data and Safety  Monitoring  Plans  can be found  on the MSKCC  
Intranet  at http://mskweb2.mskcc .org/irb/index.htm. 
There  are several  different  mechanisms  by [CONTACT_46463],  safety,  
and quality.  There  are institutional  processes  in place  for quality  assurance  (e.g.,  protocol  
monitoring,  compliance  and data verification  audits,  therapeutic  response,  and staff education  
on clinical  research  quality  assurance)  and departmental  procedures  for quality  control,  plus 
there  are two institutional  committees  that are responsible  for monitoring  the activities  of our 
clinical  trials programs.  The committees,  Data and Safety  Monitoring  Committee  (DSMC)  for 
Phase  I and II clinical  trials,  and the Data and Safety  Monitoring  Board  (DSMB) for Phase  III 
clinical  trials,  report  to the Center’s  Research  Council  and Institutional  Review  Board.  
During  the protocol  development  and review  process,  each  protocol  will be assessed  for its 
level of risk and degree  of monitoring  required.  Every  type of protocol  (e.g.,  National  Institutes  
of Health  sponsored,  in-house  sponsored,  industrial  sponsored,  National  Cancer  Institute  
cooperative  group,  etc.) will be addressed  and the monitoring  procedures  will be established  at 
the time of protocol  activation.

• Death  
• A life-threatening  adverse  event  
• An adverse  event  that results  in inpatient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_56901]  
• A persistent  or significant  incapacity  or substantial  disruption  of the ability  to 
conduct  normal  life functions  
• A congenital  anomaly/birth  defect  
• Important  Medical  Events  (IME)  that may not result  in death,  be life threatening,  or 
require  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_28613],  based  upon  medical  
judgment,  they may jeopardize  the patient  or subject  and may require  medical  or 
surgical  intervention  to prevent  one of the outcomes  listed  in this definition  
Note: Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_46426] a planned  procedure/disease  treatment  is not considered  an SAE.  
 
Suspected  transmission  of an infectious  agent  via the study  drug is an SAE.  
Although  pregnancy,  overdose,  cancer,  and potential  drug induced  liver injury  are not always  serious  
by [CONTACT_52252],  these  events  must  always  be handled  as an SAE.  
Any component  of a study  endpoint  that is considered  related  to the study  therapy  (radiation  or 
Nivolumab)  should  be reported  as an SAE.  
 
 
SAE reporting  is required  as soon  as the participant  signs  consent  and is registered.   SAE reporting  
is required  for 30-days after the participant’s  last investigational  treatment  or intervention.  Any 
events  that occur  after the 30-day period  and that are at least possibly  related  to protocol  treatment  
must  be reported.  
 
An SAE must  be reported  to the IRB/PB  within  5 calendar  days of the event.  The IRB/PB  requires  a 
Clinical  Research  Database  (CRDB)  SAE report  should  be submitted  electronically  to the SAE 
Office  as follows:  
For IND/IDE  trials:  Reports  that include  a Grade  5 SAE should  be sent to [EMAIL_440] . 
All other  reports  should  be sent to [EMAIL_2141] .

• An SAE report  should  be completed  for any event  where  doubt  exists  regarding  its 
seriousness.  
• For studies  with long-term follow -up periods  in which  safety  data are being  reported,  
include  the timing  of SAE collection  in the protocol.  
• If the investigator  believes  that an SAE is not related  to study  drug,  but is potentially  
related  to the conditions  of the study  (such  as withdrawal  of previous  therapy  or a 
complication  of a study  procedure),  the relationship  should  be specified  in the narrative  
section  of the SAE Report  Form.  
• If only limited  information  is initially  available,  follow -up reports  are required.  (Note:  
Follow -up SAE reports  should  include  the same  investigator  term(s)  initially  reported.)  
• If an ongoing  SAE changes  in its intensity  or relationship  to study  drug or if new 
information  becomes  available,  a follow -up SAE report  should  be sent within  [ADDRESS_1125925]  be recorded  and described  on

In most  cases,  the study  drug/radiation  will be permanently  discontinued  in an appropriate  
manner.  
In the rare event  that the benefit  of continuing  study  drug is thought  to outweigh  the risk, after 
consultation  with the IRB, the pregnant  subject  may continue  the study  drug,  after a thorough  
discussion  of benefits  and risk with the subject.  
Protocol  required  procedures  for study  discontinuation  and follow -up must  be performed  on 
the subject  unless  explicitly  contraindicated  by [CONTACT_8663].

20.0     APPENDICES 
 
Appendices  will be stored  in a separate  file and will be submitted  in electronic  and/or  paper  
format.  If electronic  format,  please  submit  on file per appendix.  
TUMOR SAMPLE PD-L1 
This information  is provided  to investigators  who will be submitting  tumor  samples  to BMS 
representatives  for analysis.  Please  do not include  otherwise.  
Tumor  Tissue  Specimens  
Pre-treatment  tumor  tissue  specimens  in the form of a paraffin  embedded  block  or a minimum  
of 3 unstained  slides,  with a single  section  on positively  charged  slides  will be submitted  for 
central  PD-L1 immunohistochemistry  (IHC)  assessment.  These  biopsy  samples  should  be 
excisional,  incisional,  punch  or core needle.  Fine needle  aspi[INVESTIGATOR_813015].  PD-L1 stained  tissue  sections  will be 
assessed  by a pathologist  and scored  as PD-L1 positive  if membrane  staining  is observed.  
These  tumor  samples  may also be assessed  for the expression  of other  immune  or melanoma  
related  genes,  RNAs  and/or  proteins,  as well as, the presence  of immune  cell populations  
using  a variety  of methodologies  inclusive  of, but not limited  to immunohistochemistry  (IHC),  
qRT-PCR,  genetic  mutation  detection  and fluorescent  in-situ hybridization  (FISH).  Various  
molecular  markers  with potential  predictive  value  for the treatment  of melanoma  with 
Nivolumab,  and other  immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_813016].  These  tumor  tissue  biomarkers  include,  but are not limited  to PD-1, PD-L2, tumor  
infiltrating  lymphocytes  (TILs)  or subpopulations  of TILs and a Th1 immune  mRNA  expression  
signature.  In addition,  other  methods  of measuring  tumor  PD-L1 expression  may also be 
assessed.  Tissue  from the resected  solitary  lesions  may be assessed  for residual  tumor  cells 
and for markers  expected  to accompanytumor shrinkage  in this study,  including,  but not limited  
to TILs and subsets  thereof.

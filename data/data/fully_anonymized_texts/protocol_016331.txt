Study  Title : A Phase 2b Multicenter Dose -Ranging Study Evaluating the Safety 
and Efficacy of a Long-acting Intravitreal Sunitinib Malate Depot 
Formulation (GB -102) Compared to Intravitreal Aflibercept in 
Subjects with Neovascular (Wet) Age -related Macular Degeneration  
(ALTISSIMO  Study)  
Study Centers Planned:  Approximately 35 study centers in the [LOCATION_002]  
Objectives:  With this amendment, the ALTISSIMO Study is divided into the ALTISSIMO (Core Study) and the Extension Study. Unless otherwise specified, all segments of the protocol refer to ALTISSIMO (Core Study).  
Primary Objective  
To evaluate the safety  and duration of the effect of GB -102, as 
measured by [CONTACT_295687] -102 administered every 6 months (1 mg  followed by 
1 mg or 2 mg  followed by 1 mg) as compared to intravitreal ( IVT) 
aflibercept administered every  2 months in subjects with neovascular 
(wet) age- related macular degeneration who have received prior 
induction with anti -vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) 
Secondary Objectives  
•To evaluate the efficacy of two different dosing schemes of
IVT GB -[ADDRESS_360306] visual acuity (BCVA, ETDRS letter score)
compared to subjects receiving IVT aflibercept every
2 months
•To evaluate the efficacy  of two different dosing schemes of
IVT GB -102 administered every 6 months in maintenance of
central subfiel d thickness (CST, µm) compared to subjects
receiving IVT aflibercept every 2 months
GB-102 (Sunitinib Malate)  
Protocol GBV -102-[ADDRESS_360307] of IVT GB -102 
administered every 6 months compared to IVT aflibercept 
administered  every 2 months in subjects in ALTISSIMO  (Core 
Study) who complete all study visits through Month 12 (Day 360) and who do not require /receive rescue treatment at the Month 12 
(Day 360) final study visit 
Study Design: Multicenter, visual examiner -masked, randomized , active controlled, 
parallel -arm design. 
Eligible subjects will be randomly assigned (3:3:2) to receive 50 -µL 
IVT injections of 1 of 2 doses of study drug or aflibercept , 
respectively,  in the study eye using a stratified, blocked 
randomization scheme.  Stratification will include  baseline BCVA 
(< 60 letters vs ≥  60 letters) . Approximately 15 to 20 subjects per 
group, 56 subjects total,  will be randomized to one of the following 
treatment arms:  
Group  1:   1 mg GB-102 at baseline and Month 6 and sham  at 
Months 2, 4, 8, and 10 (N= 21) 
Group  2:   2 mg GB-102 at baseline and  1 mg GB-102 at 
Month 6 and sham  at Months 2, 4, 8, and 10 (N= 22) 
Group  3:   2 mg aflibercept q 2 months at baseline, Months 2, 
4, 6, 8 and 10 (N= 13) 
Assigned study drug will be administered on Day 1 ( Appendix 18.1). 
Subjects will return to the study center on Days 14 , 30, 60, 90, 120, 
150, 180, 210, 240, 300, 330, and 360 for safety, clinical, and imaging assessments  (Table 3 -1). Subjects will exit the study 
following all study assessments on Day 360. 
An interim safety analysis was conducted when approximately 50% of subjects had 3-months of accrued data to determine if any changes to the protocol were needed prior to the Month 6 re-dosing schedule. Unmasking of the interim safety data was made available only to the Sponsor’s Chief Medical Officer and the Vice President of Global Clinical Operations .
 The interim analysis showed no serious ocular 
adverse event s. Four subjects  experienced medication in the anterior 
chamber ( AC) in the GB-102, [ADDRESS_360308] in the GB -102, 1 mg dose arm . Based on this safety analysis, 
the sponsor decided to terminate the development of the GB-102 2 mg dose, and amended the protocol to use GB -102 1 mg for re-dosing 
of all subjects  on GB-102 at the Month 6 visit, regardless of their 
original dose assignment.   The enrollment was capped at 56 subjects  
GB-102 (Sunitinib Malate)  
Protocol GBV -102-002 
Graybug Vision, Inc.  Amendment 3  
CONFIDENTIAL  Page  6 08 September 2020  and the primary endpoint was shifted from Month 10 to M onth 12  
based on suggested feedback from  the F ood and Drug A dministration 
(FDA) . 
An unmasked primary analysis for safety and efficacy is planned 
when all subjects complete the Day 360 visit.  
The safety parameters to be collected include adverse events  (AEs) , 
serious adverse events (SAEs), physical examination  findings, 
clinical laboratory test result s, vital sign  measurements, best corrected  
visual acuity (BCVA)  assessments  using the Early Treatment 
Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) protocol, slit- lamp 
biomicroscopy findings, Age- related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) 
lens assessment s, intraocular pressure (IOP) measurements , dilated 
ophthalmoscopy results , and date of administration of rescue 
treatment . 
Efficacy parameters  will be measured by [CONTACT_295688], 
BCVA ( using the ETDRS  protocol), retinal central subfield thickness 
(CST) using spectral domain -optical coherence tomography ( SD-
OCT ), fluorescein angiography ( FA), and color fundus photography 
(CFP). 
The systemic exposure will be based on subjects assigned to each 
sunitinib treatment group. An analysis of approximately 20% of the subjects assigned to each sunitinib group will be performed. 
Safety Monitoring A medical monitor (ophthalmologist) and the Sponsor’s medical 
officer will evaluate the on-going masked safety data.   
Masking 
The visual acuity examiners, the Sponsor (other than the Vice 
President  of Global Clinical Operations) , the masked contract 
research organization (CRO) personnel, the medical monitor, and other study personnel, including individuals at a central reading center, study coordinators, laboratory vendor, etc. will remain masked relative to the GB -[ADDRESS_360309] 2 investigators who are retina specialists ; one will serve as the injecting investigator and the other 
will serve as the assessing investigator. To maintain study masking, 
GB-102 (Sunitinib Malate)  
Protocol GBV -102-[ADDRESS_360310] of the study. 
•Injecting Investigator : An injecting investigator will perform the
study drug (GB-102 or aflibercept), sham, and/or rescue
injections , will supervise the preparation and tracking of study
drug, and will perform predose and postdose safety assessmentsfor the IVT injections.
•Assessing Investi gator : An assessing investigator will supervise
and assess the collection of AEs and efficacy parameters. Theassessing investigator will determine whether rescue treatment isrequired.
The SD -OCT, FA, and CFP technicians are masked to treatment 
scheme; however, collected images may reveal to the assessing investigator or technician which subjects received the GB -[ADDRESS_360311] (GB-102) will be unmasked to treatment assignment but not the treatment scheme. Study drug will be boxed in numbered kits and identical in external appearance and weight. Kits containing GB-102 are identical in physical appearance and drug vial/diluent (pre- filled 
syringe) configuration, and fully masked as to the dose strength (1 mg  
or 2 mg) of GB-102. 
Rescue Treatment  
Rescue treatment (using aflibercept)  will be permitted in the study 
eye in any  of the study arms if the eligibility criteria are met for 
rescue treatment . 
EXTENSION  STUDY 
The Extension Study is a m ulticenter, visual examiner -masked study, 
designed to monitor the safety and duration of effect of IVT GB -102 
administered every 6 months compared to IVT aflibercept 
administered  every 2 months in subjects in ALTISSIMO  (Core 
Study) who complete all study visits through Month 12 (Day 360) and who do not require /receive rescue treatment at the Month 12 
(Day 360) final study visit. 
Enrolled subjects will be followed for monthly visits until they 
receive rescue treatment or for a maximum of  180 days (i.e, 
6 months). There will be no additional treatment with GB -102. 
The assessments to be collected include AEs, SAEs, concomitant medications, BCVA assessments using ETDRS protocol, slit- lamp 
biomicroscopy findings, AREDS lens assessments, IOP 
measurements, dilated ophthalmoscopy results, retinal CST using  
GB-102 (Sunitinib Malate)  
Protocol GBV -102-[ADDRESS_360312], color fundus photography for depot imaging (ultra-
widefield  imaging, where available ) and date of administration of 
rescue treatment.  
Once a subject meet s at least one rescue criteria and all study visit 
assessments are completed, they may receive an injection of 
aflibercept and exit the study. 
No formal statistical hypotheses testing will be performed. An 
exploratory analysis of safety and efficacy will be  performed after all 
subjects have completed the study. 
Safety Monitoring A medical monitor (ophthalmologist) and the Sponsor’s medical 
officer will evaluate the on -going masked safety data.  
Masking 
The visual acuity examiners, the Sponsor (other than the Vice 
President of Global Clinical Operations), the masked contract research organization (CRO) personnel, the medical monitor, and other study personnel, including individuals at a central reading center, study coordinators, laboratory vendor, etc. will r emain masked 
relative to the GB -[ADDRESS_360313] 2 investigators who are retina 
speci alists; one will serve as the injecting investigator and the other 
will serve as the assessing investigator. To maintain study masking, the roles of these investigators should not be switched during the conduct of the study. 
•Injecting Investigator : An injecting investigator will perform the
rescue injections, will supervise the preparation and tracking ofstudy drug, and will perform predose and postdose safetyassessments for the IVT injections.
•Assessing Investigator : An assessing in vestigator will supervise
and assess the collection of AEs, SAEs, concomitant medications,BCVA assessments using ETDRS protocol, slit- lamp

GB-102 (Sunitinib Malate)  
Protocol GBV -102-[ADDRESS_360329], Dose, 
and Mode of Administration:  GB-102 is a depot formulation of sunitinib malate  (sunitinib) 
intended for IVT injection. Sunitinib is a small molecule receptor tyrosine kinase that inhibits multiple pathways associated with pathologic angiogenesis including VEGF receptors (VEGFR) -1, -2, and -3 known to be associated with nAMD. The formulation consists of microparticles made from poly(lactic -co-glycolic) acid (PLGA) 
and methoxy-polyethylene glycol (mPEG)- PLGA. The mPEG 
component provides a hydrophilic, biocompatible property. During production, the microparticles are surface- treated to facilitate their 
aggregation upon IVT injection to form an impla nt-like depot in the 
vitreous. After IVT  injection, the microparticles degrade into lactic 
acid, glycolic acid , and mPEG. 
GB-102 is lyophilized and reconstituted with hyaluronic acid prior to 
intravitreal administration to produce an administered IVT dose of sunitinib of 1 mg  or 2 mg in a 50 µL injection using a 
27 gauge needle. 
Subjects randomized  to receive GB -102 will receive their assigned 
dose on Day 1 and Day 180. All subjects assigned to GB-102 will 
receive the 1 mg GB -102 dose at Month 6 (Day 180). To maintain 
masking to treatment scheme, sham injections will be performed in the study eye on Days 60, 120, 240, and 300 to correspond to the dosing schedule of aflibercept. 
EXTENSION STUDY 
GB-102 will not be administered during the Extension Study. 
Reference Therapy, Dose, and Mode of Administration:  Aflibercept  is recombinant fusion protein consisting of portions of 
human VEGF receptors 1 and 2 extracellular domains fused to the Fc portion of human immunoglobulin ( IgG)1 formulated as an 
iso-osmotic solution for intravitreal administration. The approved 
aflibercept dose is 2 mg in a 50 µL injection administered eve ry 
2 months. 
Subjects randomized to receive aflibercept will receive active drug on 
Days 1, 60, 120, 180, 240, and 300. 
EXTENSION STUDY 
No doses for any treatment schemes (GB-102 1 mg dose or aflibercept) will be administered during the Extension Study. However, subjects may receive aflibercept for rescue treatment therapy provided they have met the rescue treatment criteria. Once any type of rescue treatment has been administered, the subject will exit the Extension Study after undergoing the end of the Extension Study assessments.

EXTENSION STUDY
Exploratory Endpoints
All safety and efficacy data collected beyond Month 12 (Day 360) 
will be assessed in an exploratory manner. 
Statistical Methods:  Analysis Population 
•Safety analysis set  (SS) : Includes all randomized subjects w ho
receive at least one dose of study treatment. Subjects will be
analyzed according to actual treatment scheme received.
•Full analysis set ( FAS): Includes all randomized subjects who
receive at least one dose of study treatment, and c omplete a
baseline and at least one post- baseline visit. All data collected
from s ubjects who receive rescue treatment during the study will
be included in the FAS. Subjects will be analyzed according totheir assigned treatment.  All efficacy analyses will  be conducted
on the FAS and these analyses will be considered primary.
•Per protocol analysis set  (PP): Consists of a subset of the FAS and
includes subjects with no major protocol violations that wouldaffect the assessment of the primary efficacy endp oint of the
study. Analyses conducted on the PP set will be consideredsecondary .
Primary Endpoint and Analysis 
The primary efficacy endpoint is the time to first rescue treatment 
(GB-102 only). This would be further validated throught assessing 
time to fulfillment of at least one rescue criterion.  
GB-102 (Sunitinib Malate)  
Protocol GBV -102-[ADDRESS_360331] rescue treatment/ fulfillment of at least one rescue 
criterion will be analyzed using the Kaplan -Meier method. The 
probability of remaining rescue treatment free /not fulfilling at least 
one rescue criterion  will be reported for the Month 6 and Month 12 
visits with associated 80% confidence intervals (CI) based on 
Greenwood’s standard error estimate. Kapl an-Meier curves will be 
produced. If calculable, estimates of the median time to fulfillment of at least on rescue criterion  and the 25th and 75th percentiles will be 
calculated with corresponding 80% CIs.  The FAS will be the primary 
population used for analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint. 
For this analysis, the interval censored nature of the time to first rescue treatment/fulfillment of  at least one rescue criterion with 
regard to the scheduled study visits is considered: If a subj ect receives 
a rescue treatment/ fulfills a rescue criterion during an unscheduled 
visit, then the subject will be considered to have met the event of interest in the visit interval which ends at the next scheduled study visit that occurs after the unscheduled visit. Subjects who do not receive rescue medication/fulfill a rescue criterion will be censored on last scheduled study visit recorded for the subject.  
Exploratory comparisons between each GB-[ADDRESS_360332] stratified by [CONTACT_295691] (< 60 letters vs ≥ 60 letters), as defined at the time of randomization. The Peto method will be used to estimate the hazard ratio and asymptotic 80% confidence interval based on the stra tified 
log rank test statistic.  
A primary endpoint analysis will be conducted when all subjects complete the Month 12 (Day 360) visit.  
Secondary Endpoint Analyses  
The change from baseline in BCVA and CST will be presented by [CONTACT_295692] 80% confidence intervals (CI) for all visits. A similar analysis will be done for absolute values and change in BCVA and CST relative to the time of fir st rescue 
treatment (response to rescue treatment) . Time to fulfillment of at 
least one rescue criterion st arting at the Month 6 visit th rough Month 
12 will be summarized using descriptive statistics including 80% CIs and will be presented for the number of rescue treatments, number of scheduled treatments, number of total of rescue and scheduled treatments , and number of times that at least one rescue criterion is 
met from baseline through Month 12.

1.1 Background 
Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of irreversible blindness among 
people who are 50 years of age or older in the industrialized world ( Wong 2014). For more than 
a decade, intravitreally administered anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) agents 
targeting VEGF-A have revolutionized the treatment of neovascular (wet) AMD with the use of aflibercept ( EYLEA
® Injection ), ranibizumab ( LUCENTIS® Intravitreal Injection ), or off- label 
intravitreal (IVT) bevacizumab ( AVASTIN® Solution, Collet 2013, Eandi 2016) . Despi[INVESTIGATOR_295675]-saving success of these drugs, the need for frequent IVT injections has emerged as a burdensome consequence for both patients and retinal specialists. Intravitreal injections have become the most commonly performed ophthalmic procedure in the [LOCATION_002] (US), surpassing cataract extraction, with an estimated 6 million injections performed in 2016 alone and a projected annual growth rate of approximately 10% ( Williams  2014). 
Randomized clinical studies have uniformly demonstrated that maximum gains in visual acuity can be achieved through regimented monthly IVT injections of anti- VEGF drugs (CATT  
Research Group 2011, Heier  2012, Rosenfeld  2006). However, mandated life-long monthly 
injections are impractical and unsustainable due to costs, disruption in quality-of- life 
(eg, appointments, travel, waiting times), and the clinical staffing required to manage an ever 
increasing number of patients with the disease ( Prenner  2015). Furthermore, approximately 20% 
to 30% of treated patients exhibit persistent fluid in the retina despi[INVESTIGATOR_295676], suggesting the need for newer pharmacologic approaches with broader mechanisms of action beyond VEGF-A suppression alone ( Jaffe 2016) . Given a decade of clinical experience in 
treating patients with wet AMD, retinal practitioners recently surveyed by [CONTACT_295697] [ADDRESS_360351] unmet needs are: “long-acting sustained (drug) delivery” (74% of respondents); “reduced treatment burden” (72% of respondents); and “new treatment mechanisms of action” (45% of respondents) ( ASRS 2016). 
To address the unmet medical need  in patients with AMD, Graybug Vision has developed a 
proprietary drug product (GB-102) intended to reduce the frequency of IVT injections and provide a mechanism of action involving blockade of multiple VEGF receptor targets associated with angiogenesis, vascular permeability, cellular proliferation,  which are key biologic processes 
associated with the progression of choroidal neovascularization (CNV), the hallmark lesion in neovascular AMD.

GB-102 is a depot formulation of sunitini b malate intend ed for IVT injection. The formulation 
consists of microparticles made from poly(lactic -co-glycolic) acid (PLGA) and 
methoxy-polyethylene glycol (mPEG)- PLGA. The mPEG component provides a hydrophilic, 
biocompatible property. During production, the microparticles are surface treated to facilitate 
their aggregation upon IVT injection to form an impla nt-like depot in the vitreous. After IVT  
injection, the microparticles degrade into lactic acid, glycolic acid , and mPEG . GB -[ADDRESS_360353] 6 months with a single 50- μL IVT

in Section  1.3.1. 
SUTENT® (sunitinib malate) was approved by [CONTACT_2165] (FDA) and the 
European Medicines Agency in 2006 in oral capsule form for the treatment of gastrointestinal stromal tumor and renal cell carcinoma, and in 2011 for the treatment of pancreatic 
neuroendocrine tumor ( SUTENT
® Capsules ) and represents a class of small molecules referred 
to as receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). 
Sunitinib is a small molecule (532.6 g/mol) and is a multiple receptor TKI that prevents receptor 
phosphorylation and “turns off” the downstream effects of selected receptors, particularly all the 
vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR -1, -2, and -3) (Figure 1-1) which are 
known to influence nAMD. GB -102 offers the potential for more complete blockade of 
VEGF -mediated angiogenesis compared to blockade of VEGF-A ligand alone (eg, aflibercept, 
bevacizumab, or ranibizumab). A full description of sunitinib is provided in the Investigator’s Brochure.

1.3 General Information  
1.3.1 Nonclinical Studies  
Sunitinib malate has been evaluated in nonclinical safety studies in compliance with 
International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) guidelines to support its approval for cancer indications (SUTENT
®). Nonclinical IND-enabling studies describing SUTENT’s primary and 
secondary pharmacodynamics, safety pharmacology, pharmacokinetics (PK), toxicology/toxicokinetics (single and repeat dose), genotoxicity, reproductive toxicity, phototoxicity, and local tolerance (dermal and ocular) have been published in the literature and 
can be referenced in the Investigator’s Brochure for GB -102 (IB).  
A summary of the ocular pharmacology, tissue PK, and toxicology for GB-102 and sunitinib follows.

Sunitinib has demonstrated evidence of inhibiting angiogenesis, vascular permeability, 
proliferation, and fibrosis – key findings associated with choroidal neovascular lesions in nAMD. Sunitinib has also demonstrated neuroprotective effects. 
Oral Sunitinib Malate Inhibits CNV in a Murine Laser Injury Model The initial evidence to demonstrate the ability of sunitinib malate to inhibit choroidal 
neovascular permeability was in a laser -induced CNV mouse model ( Takahashi  2006). Three 
groups of mice (N = 5 per group) were orally administered 40, 80, 150 mg/kg sunitinib malate or vehicle for 5 days following laser endophotocoagulation of the retina and Bruch’s membrane. Permeability leakage of the CNV lesions was asse ssed by [CONTACT_228628] (FA) in vivo . 
Volume of the CNV lesions was quantified histologically in ocular cross-sections. The authors reported a dose-response in both the FA scores and histologic CNV lesion volume compared with vehicle control ( Figure 1 -2).

Murine Laser Injury Model  For Up to 6 Months 
The murine model of laser-induced rupture of Bruch’s membrane results in C NV that is similar 
to type 2 C NV in patients with nAMD, because the new vessels originate from the choroid and 
penetrate through Bruch’s membrane and the retinal pi[INVESTIGATOR_20092] (RPE) into the subretinal space (Tsujinaka 2018). Studies in this model helped to implicate VEGF as a critical 
stimulus for nAMD and predicted the clinical benefits seen with aflibercept, a recombinant VEGF -neutralizing protein commonly used to treat patients subjects  with nA MD. In order to 
assess the efficacy of GB -102 microparticles ( MPs) over time, C57BL/6 mice were given an IVT 
injection of microparticles ( MPs) containing 10 µg sunitinib in one eye and empty MPs in the 
fellow eye and then had laser -induced rupture of Bruch’s membrane at 3 locations in each eye at 
time points ranging from 1 to 24 weeks after injection. Compared with empty MP fellow eye controls, the mean area of C NV at Bruch’s membrane rupture sites was significantly less in eyes 
injected with MPs containing 10 µg sunitinib at each time point through week 24 ( Figure 1-3).

reduce stress -induced apoptosis of RGCs in models of ischemia and optic nerve crush injury 
(Ruiz  2005, Sharma 2011). Sunitinib also promotes photoreceptor survival and function as 
demonstrated in a murine light damage model of retinal degeneration ( Kim 2015).

Single Intravitreal Injection of GB-102 Sustains Inhibitory Levels of Drug in the Retinal Pi[INVESTIGATOR_295677] -Choroid up to 6 Months in Pi[INVESTIGATOR_228610] 6 Months 
Ocular tissue PK was conducted in male pi[INVESTIGATOR_228611] a single IVT administration of sunitinib malate GB -102 (1.0 mg/eye). Tissue levels of drug were determined 
in the posterior segment (retina, RPE-choroid, vitreous humor) and anterior segment (cornea, iris-ciliary body, and lens) as determined by [CONTACT_60628]/tandem mass spectrometry at 
various time points ( Peterson  2016). 
Following injection, sunitinib drug levels are highest in tissues containing melanin pi[INVESTIGATOR_2517] (Figure 1-4).  Tissue drug levels, in descending order, are as follows: RPE -choroid > iris- ciliary 
body > retina/lens > cornea > vitreous. There were no toxicological concerns related to pi[INVESTIGATOR_2517]-binding discovered during preclinical testing. Drug concentrations of sunitinib are present in RPE-choroid and retina at 2- to 3-log orders higher than the kinetic inhibition constant
 to 
suppress VEGFR through [ADDRESS_360355] of the RPE-choroid (melanin binding). 
Sunitinib was cleared from posterior segment ocular tissues with an average half- life of 
approximately 19 days with a range of 2-3.5 weeks. Peak exposure (T
max) was typi[INVESTIGATOR_16195] 
3 to 4 months for retina and RPE-choroid, whereas vitreous T max occurred at 1 month. Given a 
Tmax at 3 to 4 months and a half-life of 0.64 months, sunitinib would be cleared from the 
posterior segment ocular tissues within 6 to 8 months.

A Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) plasma toxicokinetics study was conducted in Dutch belted 
rabbits receiving a single IVT administration of a 2.0 mg/eye dose of GB-102 (50 µ L) 
(CRL  Report 5700643). Plasma samples were assayed for sunitinib (lower limit of quantitation

of sunitinib were detected systemically at any time point.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Toxicology 
Sunitinib malate was originally developed as an orally administered agent for the treatment of 
advanced malignancies at a daily dose of 37 to 50 mg ( SUTENT
® Capsules ). The steady state 
plasma levels of sunitinib at the oral recommended daily dose is approximately 60 to 100 ng/mL. Based on allometric scaling from nonclinical ocular PK  studies (rab bits, rats) to humans, it is 
estimated that a single orally administered approved dose of 50 mg sunitinib in man results in uveal tissue concentration of drug that a re 1-log to 2-log orders higher than a single IVT 
injection of GB-102 containing 1 mg sunitinib ( Peterson  2016, Speed  2012).

1.4.1 Protocol GBV-102-001 (Part 1) 
Objectives . Part 1 of the Phase 1/2a protocol GBV-102-[ADDRESS_360359]- in-human evaluation 
study of GB-102. The primary study objective was to assess safety, tolerability, and 
pharmacodynamic parameters (BCVA, CST) following a single IVT injection of GB-102. 
[Note: Part 2 of Protocol GBV-102-001 was a planned randomized, controlled , 3-arm study 
comparing 2 doses levels of GB-102 administered every 6 months to aflibercept administered 
every 2 months .  This portion of the study was not be conducted but replaced with Phase 2b 
dose-ranging study (Protocol GBV-102-002)]. 
Study Population. Subjects with the diagnosis of nAMD within the past [ADDRESS_360360] 3 prior IVT injections of any anti-VEGF agent (aflibercept, bevacizumab, or ranibizumab ), 
show ed a response to prior treatment, and had evidence of retinal fluid and/or leakage on 
fluorescein angiography at the time of screening.  
Methods. Following confirmation of lesion qualification by a third-party reading center, eligible subjects were assigned to receive a single IVT injection of GB -102 in 1 of 4 consecutively 
initiated, open-label, dose cohorts in the designated study eye ( Table 1 -2):

GB-102 was administered on Day 1 in all cohorts. Subjects returned to the study center on 
targeted Days 3 (sentinel subjects only), 14, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 210, and 240 for safety, 
clinical, and imaging assessments. Subjects exited the study following all study assessments on Day 240 (Month 8). Rescue treatment (aflibercept) was available to subject who met  
protocol- specified criteria.  
The safety parameters collected included adverse events (AEs), BCVA assessments (ETDRS protocol), and full ophthalmic examination (slit lamp biomicroscopy, intraocular pressure (IOP) measurements, and dilated ophthalmoscopy results) . Plasma samples were obtained on all 
subjects to characterize sy stemic exposure to sunitinib. 
Functional and pharmacodynamic assessments included  BCVA (ETDRS protocol), CST 
measurements (SD -OCT), fluorescein angiograms (FA), and color fundus photography (CFP). 
Imaging data was interpreted by [CONTACT_120620] -party reading center.  
The intent- to-treat (ITT) population is defined as all subjects who received any study treatment at 
baseline, have a baseline BCVA and CST measurement, and at least one post -baseline BCVA 
and CST measurement in the study eye, and includes s ubjects who have received rescue. The per 
protocol analysis set (PP) population in this report is defined the same as the ITT population but excludes subjects with major protocol violations that would affect the assessment of the primary efficacy endpoint of the study. The safety population are any subjects who have received study treatment.   
Results. Seventy -one (71) subjects were screened, and 32 subjects were enrolled from 8 study 
sites in the [LOCATION_002] ( Table 1 -3). The first subject was enrolled on August 29, [ADDRESS_360361] completed the study on January 16, 2019. Four (4) subjects (Cohort A, N=1; Cohort B, N=3) were early terminations: [ADDRESS_360362] died secondary to metastatic gastric cancer (not previously diagnosed) and 3 subjects withdrew consent (hardships in complying with monthly visits from remote location s). The total cumulative subject-days exposed to GB-102 was 
approximately 7374 days. 
A summary of the study population at baseline is provided in Table 1 -3. The mean age was 
74.2 years with a baseline BCVA of approximately  20/50 (estimated Snellen equivalent), central 
subfield thickness of [ADDRESS_360363] dose of GB-102.

The most frequently reported AE was the observation of microparticles migrating into the 
anterior chamber  (AC). The cause was due to incomplete aggregation of the injected 
microparticles to form a solid depot allow ing free -floating microparticles to move from the 
vitreous into the AC. Medication residue pres ent were transient subjective reports from subjects 
whereby [CONTACT_295700]’s symptoms. While migration of intravitreal drug -eluting implants 
into the anterior chamber can occur in aphakic or pseudophakic subjects ( Collet 2013), the 
occurrence of microparticle AC migration in phakic subjects was unexpected and may be related to age- related changes in the zonules, similar to observations in patients receiving intravitreal 
steroid suspensions ( Ruiz-Moreno 2005).  
Mildly elevated IOP was observed in 5 subjects that also had microparticles in the anterior chamber. AC migration presented generally 2 to 3 months following IVT GB-102; IOP elevation presented generally 1 to 2 months later. The cause for elevated IOP may be due, in part, to partial obstruction of the trabecular meshwork; however, the use of topi[INVESTIGATOR_295678] a confounder. 
The management of particles in the AC was either AC lavage (N=3) or observation alone (N=6). 
With observation alone, the particles dissolved spontaneously approximately 1 to 2 months following the diagnosis. Thus, AC migration appears self-limited, reversible, with no long- term 
sequelae. IOP responded to topi[INVESTIGATOR_15434]- lowering drops.

[IP_ADDRESS] Conclusions 
Part 1 of t he Phase 1/2a study met its primary endpoint of safety and tolerability. There were no 
ocular SAEs or dose-limiting toxicity events. The most commonly reported ocular AEs related to 
particle migration into the anterior chamber that may be associated with mild elevation in IOP; however, these events can be managed conservatively (biodegradation) and are self -limited, 
reversible, with no long- term sequelae.  
There is a clear and durable pharmacodynamic effect of GB -[ADDRESS_360379], and rescue rates with ≥  6-month dosing duration achieved in a majority of subjects. 
Overall, the results support continued development of GB-102. 
1.4.2 Protocol GBV-102-003 (Phase 2a) 
The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacodynamic response of 
two dose strengths (1 mg and 2 mg) of GB-102 administered as a single injection in subjects with refractory macular edema (ME) secondary to DME or RVO. This study is active and fully enrolled with a total of 21 subjects (N=10, 1 mg; N=11, 2 mg). Study completion is anticipated 1H 2020. 
A single subject had a reported 2 drug- related ocular serious adverse event s (SAE s).  
The subject with the ocular SAE s is a [ADDRESS_360380] SAE of decreased visual acuity . Associated findings included posterior 
uveitis with dispersed vitreous opacities from free-floating drug material. The investigator elected to remove the medication in the AC via AC lavage/washout followed by a pars plana vitrectomy to remove the dispersed drug in the vitreous. Per the investigator, the consistency

compared with a fixed regimen of [ADDRESS_360382] enrolled was September 2019 with a planned sample size of 160 subjects. Due to the reported SAE in Protocol GBV-102-003 on December 17, 2019, enrollment in the ALTISSIMO study was voluntarily suspended by [CONTACT_17190] D ecember 19, 2019 as a safety 
precaution after a total of 56 subjects had been enrolled. An unmasked limited interim safety review was conducted by [CONTACT_1034] (Chief Medical Officer and the Vice President  of Global 
Clinical Operations) in February 2020. During this safety review, no SAEs had been reported in 
ALTISSIMO; however, 5 subjects had a report of drug material observed in the AC  (N=4, 2 mg; 
N=1, 1 mg). All reported cases were mild -to-moderate in severity. One subject who received the 
2 mg dose developed a moderate pseudohypopyon and was managed with elective AC lavage and pars plana vitrectomy without complication. The subjects remain in the study and are under observation alone or undergoing treatment with a short course of prophylactic topi[INVESTIGATOR_8826].   
The Sponsor elected to stop further enrollment in ALTISSIMO and to re- dose (Month 6 visit) 
only the [ADDRESS_360383] of IVT GB-102 administered every 6  months compared to IVT aflibercept administered 
every 2 months in subjects in ALTISSIMO (Core Study) who complete all s tudy visits through 
Month 12 (Day 360) and who do not require /receive rescue treatment at the Month 12 (Day 360) 
final study visit. Enrolled subjects will be followed for monthly visits until they receive rescue treatment or for a maximum of  180 days (i.e, 6 months). There will be no additional treatment 
with GB -102. With this amendment, the ALTISSIMO study is divided into the ALTISSIMO 
(Core Study) and the Extension Study. Unless otherwise specified, all segments of the protocol refer to the ALTISSIMO (Core Study).

3.1.1 ALTISSIMO (Core Study): Overall Study Design Summary  
This is a Phase [ADDRESS_360386] 3 prior IVT injections of an anti -VEGF agent (aflibercept, bevacizumab, or ranibizumab) 
and demonstrated a response to prior treatment within [ADDRESS_360387] , FA, and 
color fundus photography (CFP) evaluation of the CNV lesion. 
Eligible subjects will be randomly assigned (3:3:2) to receive 50-µL IVT injections of 1 of 
2 doses of study drug or aflibercept , respectively,  in the study eye using a stratified, blocked 
randomization scheme. S tratification will include baseline BCVA ( < 60 letters vs ≥  60 letters) . 
Approximately 15 to 20 subjects per group, 56 subjects total, will be randomized to one of the following treatment arms: 
Group  1:   1 mg GB-102 at baseline and  Month 6 and sham at Months 2, 4, 8, and 10 
(N=21) 
Group  2:   2 mg GB-102 at baseline and  1 mg GB-102 at Month 6 and sham at 
Months 2, 4, 8, and 10 (N=22) 
Group  3:   2 mg aflibercept q 2 months at baseline, Months 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 (N= 13) 
Assigned study drug will be administered on Day 1 ( Appendix 18.1).  Subjects will return to the 
study center on Days 14, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 210, 240, 300, 330, and 360 for safety, 
clinical, and imaging assessments  (Table 3-1 ). Subjects will exit the study following all study 
assessments on Day  360. 
An interim safety analysis was conducted when approximately 50% of subjects had 3-months of accrued data to d etermine if any changes to the protocol were needed prior to the Month 6  
re-dosing schedule. Unmasking of the interim safety data was made available only to the 
Sponsor’s Chief Medical Officer and the Vice President of Global Clinical Operations.
 The 
interim analysis showed no serious ocular adverse events. Four subjects experienced medication in the anterior chamber ( AC) in the GB-102, [ADDRESS_360388] in the GB -
102, 1 mg  dose arm . Based on this safety analysis, the sponsor decided to terminate the 
development of the GB-102 2 mg dose, and amended the protocol to use GB -102 1 mg for re-
dosing of all subjects on GB-102 at the Month 6 visit, regardless of their original dose assignment.  The  enrollment was capped at 5 6 subjects  and the primary endpoint was shifted

Administration (FDA) . 
An unmasked primary analysis for safety and efficacy is planned when all subjects complete the 
Day 360 visit.  
The safety parameters to be collected include adverse events  (AEs) , serious adverse events 
(SAEs), physical examination  findings , clinical laborat ory test result s, vital sign measurements, 
best corrected  visual a cuity (BCVA)  assessments using the Early Treatment Diabetic 
Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) protocol, slit-lamp biomicroscopy findings, Age- related Eye 
Disease Study (AREDS) lens assessment s, intr aocular pressure (IOP)  measurements , dilated 
ophthalmoscopy results, and date of administration of rescue treatment.  
Efficacy parameters  will be measured by [CONTACT_295688], BCVA ( using the ETDRS  
protocol), retinal central subfield thickness (CST) using spectral domain- optical coherence 
tomography ( SD-OCT ), fluorescein angiography ( FA), and color fundus photography ( CFP). 
The systemic exposure will be based on subjects assigned to each sunitinib treatment group. An analysis of approximately 20% of the subjects assigned to each sunitinib group will be performed.  
3.1.2 Extension Study: Overall Study Design Summary  
The Extension Study is a m ulticenter, visual examiner -masked study, designed to monitor the 
safety and duration of effect of IVT GB-102 administered every 6 months compared to IVT 
aflibercept administered  every 2 months in subjects in ALTISSIMO  (Core Study) wh o complete 
all study visits through Month 12 (Day 360) and who do not require /receive rescue treatment at 
the Month 12 (Day 360) final study visit. 
Enrolled subjects will be followed for monthly visits until they receive rescue treatment or for a 
maximum o f 180 days (i.e, 6 months). There will be no additional treatment with GB -102. 
The assessments to be collected include AEs, SAEs, concomitant medications, BCVA assessments using ETDRS protocol, slit-lamp biomicroscopy findings, AREDS lens assessments, IOP measurements, dilated ophthalmoscopy results, retinal CST using SD-OCT, color fundus photography for depot imaging ( ultra-widefield  imaging, where available) and date of 
administration of rescue treatment.  
Once a subject meet s at least one rescue criteria and all study visit assessments are completed, 
they may receive an injection of aflibercept and exit the study. 
No formal statistical hypotheses testing will be performed. An exploratory analysis of safety and 
efficacy will be performed after all subjects  have completed the study.

GB-102 (Sunitinib Malate)  
Protocol GBV -102-[ADDRESS_360410] (GB-102) 
GB-102 is a depot formulation of sunitinib malate intended for IVT injection. 
The formulation consists of microparticles made from PLGA and mPEG -PLGA. The mPEG 
component provides a hydrophilic, biocompatible property. During production, the 
microparticles are surface treated to facilitate their aggregation upon IVT injection to form an 
impla nt-like depot in the vitreous. After IVT  injection, the microparticles degrade into lactic 
acid, glycolic acid , and mPEG. GB- 102 microparticles are approximately 25 μm i n diameter, 
which allows IVT delivery in a 50- μL injection using a 27 G thin-walled needle in the inferior 
pars plana (6 o’ clock region). The mPEG surface treatment of the microparticles facilitates 
aggregation into a single bioabsorbable, implant- like dep ot following IVT injection. This 
delivery method allows the microparticles to assume residence in the inferior portion of the posterior segment, away from the visual axis. The depot slowly biodegrades over [ADDRESS_360411] a trained , technician who will prepare the s tudy drug syringes for 
IVT injection . This technician will be unmasked to treatment assignment but not the treatment 
scheme of GB -102. The Sponsor will provide the necessary training and all supplies required for 
the reconstitution of study drug, including vials containing lyophilized GB-102 dry powder, 
pre-filled syringe with hyaluronic acid, needles , and syringes. A flibercept  (EYLEA
®, 2.0 mg) 
and associated administration su pplies will be provided by [CONTACT_295702] . 
Each study center  will have at least [ADDRESS_360412] of the study. Information regarding the 2 physician investigators is presented in Section 3.1. 
Adequate topi[INVESTIGATOR_295684] (eg, p ovidone iodine solution) will be 
given prior to the IVT or sham injection per the injecting investigator ’s standard -of-care. All IOP 
measurements will be obtained  before each injection.  The investigational product, regardless of 
concentration, should be prepared and administered as follows in the study:

6.7.1 ALTISSIMO (Core Study): Subject Discontinuation 
Subjects should not be withdrawn due to an AE  (unless related  to subject death) , pregnancy, lack 
of efficacy, protocol deviations, or other reason except for the subject withdrawing consent or 
being lost to follow-up. If a subject is enrolled in the study and discontinues from treatme nt, 
he/she should be encouraged to remain in the study through study completion to allow continued safety assessment and monitoring, unless the subject withdraws consent. 
In the event of subject withdrawal prior to the end of the study, study assessments for the early 
termination visit should be conducted whenever possible. If a subject withdraws from the study, he or she may not re-enter the study. At the time of withdrawal, the investigator should advise the subject of other available treatment options. When a subject withdraws from the study, the reason(s) for withdrawal will be recorded on the CRF. 
In the event of a subject death during the study, the date of death (as listed on the death 
certificate) will be used as the date of study withdrawal.  
If a su bject fails to return for a scheduled visit, it is the responsibility of the investigator or 
designee to document all efforts made to contact [CONTACT_295707]. If a subject cannot be contact[CONTACT_213229] [ADDRESS_360434] a known reason for discontinuation (eg, withdrawal of consent), the reason for discontinuation will be recorded as “lost to  
follow- up.” The date that the certified letter was m ailed will be considered the date of study 
withdrawal.  
6.7.2 Extension Study: Subject Discontinuation 
Subjects should not be withdrawn due to an AE (unless related to subject death) , pregnancy, lack 
of efficacy, protocol deviations, or other reason except for the subject withdrawing consent, receiving a rescue treatment (aflibercept  or any other type of rescue treatment [i.e., anti- VEGF 
therapy]) or being lost to follow-up.  
In the event of subject withdrawal prior to the end of the study, study assessments for the early 
termination visit should be conducted whenever possible. If a subject withdraws from the study, he or she may not re-enter the study. At the time of withdrawal, the investigator should advise the subject of other available treatment options. When a subject withdraws from the study, the reason(s) for withdrawal will be recorded on the CRF.

• Eyelids 
• Conjunctiva 
• Cornea 
• Anterior chamber  
• Iris 
• Pupil 
• Lens  
If any findings are abnormal, exact findings should be specified and noted as either clinically or 
not clinically significant.  
In addition, the lens will be graded by [CONTACT_295708], cortical, and posterior subcapsular lens opacities using the AREDS photographic reference scale. For detailed instructions regarding AREDS lens scoring, refer to the separately provided AREDS lens grading scale ( Chew 2010). 
7.10 Intraocular Pressure  
At each study visit, IOP will be measured according to routine clinical practice using Goldmann applanation tonometry or Tono- Pen in both eyes at all study visits (must be performed prior to 
dilation and the IVT injection of study drug at dosing visits). A single measurement will be made to obtain a determination of the IOP at each study visit. Whether Goldmann applanation tonometry or Tono-Pen is used during the study, the Investigator’s standard technique will be used throughout the study. In addition, al l reasonable efforts will be made to have the same 
examiner obtain all IOP measurements for a given subject using the same instrument for screening and the subject follow- up assessments for each subject.

continue to be performed in accordance with the manufacturer’s specifications until the last subject at the study center has exited the study. For detailed instructions regarding instrument calibration, refer to the calibration instructions supplied with the instrument.  
7.11 Dilated Ophthalmoscopy 
Dilated fundus examination of both eyes will be performed in all subjects by [CONTACT_295709]. The following will be observed for the presence of abnormalities: 
• Vitreous body 
• Macula  
• Peripheral retina  
• Choroid 
• Optic nerve 
If any findings are abnormal, exact findings should be specified and noted as either clinically or 
not clinically significant. All abnormal findings that are clinically significant will be described and noted as AEs. 
7.12 Spectral Domain – Optical Coherence Tomography  
The SD -OCT imaging will be performed for both eyes to measure and asse ss cross- sectional 
images of the anatomic layers of the retina and to detect the presence of retinal fluid. Images will 
be obtained using a SD-OCT device by [CONTACT_228641]. Preferably the same device will be used for screening and the subsequent follow- up assessments for each 
subject. For detailed instructions regarding collection of SD-OCT imaging, refer to the separately provided Image Acquisition Guidelines (IAG). 
7.13 Fluorescein Angiography  
The FA imaging (after IVT administration of fluorescein dye) of both eyes will be performed to 
examine the circulation of the retina and characteristics of the CNV lesion in the study eye according to standard FA image capture protocol. The FA images will be obtained using a digital camera by [CONTACT_228641]. For detailed instructions regarding collection of FA imaging, refer to the separately provided IAG. 
7.14 Color Fundus Photography  
The CFP of both eyes will be performed to assess characteristics of the retina. The photographs 
will be obtained using a digital fundus camera and will be performed by [CONTACT_295710]. For detailed instructions regarding collection of CFP imaging, refer to the separately provided I mage Acquisition Guidelines (IAG).

GB-102 (Sunitinib Malate)  
Protocol GBV -102-[ADDRESS_360446]’s last day of study participation. The 
following information will be collected for all AEs and recorded on the subject’s source document and AE CRF:  
• Event description (diagnosis preferred, if unknown, record the signs/symptoms) 
• Onset and resolution dates 
• Severity (intensity)  
• Relationship to study drug or study procedure (c ausality) as determined by [CONTACT_295711] 
• Seriousness 
• Expectedness  
• Action taken with study drug 
• Action with nondrug therapy  
• Outcome 
8.[ADDRESS_360447] medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether 
or not considered drug- related.  
An AE can therefore be:  
• Any unfavorable and unintended medical diagnosis, sign, or symptom 
• Any new undesirable medical occurrence or unfavorable or unintended change in a pre-existing condition that occurs during or after study treatment 
• Laboratory abnormality, vital sign, or ophthalmic assessment that is assessed as clinically significa nt and different from baseline (eg, requiring discontinuation of study treatment, 
specific treatment, or a change in subject management) ; if possible, changes in laboratory 
results or changes in vital signs that meet the definition of an AE should be repor ted as a 
medical diagnosis rathe r than as the abnormal value (eg , “hypertension” rather t han “blood 
pressure increased”)  
The following are special considerations when determining and reporting AEs: 
• Whenever possible, the investigator should group signs or symptoms that constitute a single 
diagnosis under a single AE term (eg, “cough, rhinitis, and sneezing” might be grouped 
together as “uppe r respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092]”).

CONFIDENTIAL  Page  83 08 September 2020  • Progression of neovascular AMD, including worsening of anticipated clinical signs or 
symptoms, which are collected as clinical efficacy variable and assessed as unequivocally associated with the disease progression and/or lack of efficacy, should NOT be reported as AEs unless disease progression is greater than anticipated in the natural c ourse of the disease.  
• A pre -existing condition is not considered an AE  unless the condition worsens (increases in  
frequ ency, severity, or specificity) during or following study drug administration. 
Fluctuations in a pre-existing condition should be assessed by [CONTACT_941] i nvestigator, and those that 
fall within the limits of expected fluc tuations for the disease state ( and are not asses sed as 
worsening of the disease) should not be considered AEs. Any change assessed as clinically significant worsening of the disease from baseline must be documented as an AE. 
• Elective surgery or routine diagnostic procedures are not considered AEs. However, an untoward medical event occurring during the pre scheduled  elective surgery or diagnostic 
procedure should be recorded as an AE.  
• Death itself is not considered an AE; it is instead the outcome of an AE. 
A treatment emergent adverse event (TEAE) is an  AE with an onset anytime from when the 
subject has received study drug through the end of study and at least [ADDRESS_360448] dose of study drug, whether or not it is considered causally related to the study drug. 
Note: AE s must be collected once informed consent has been obtained, regardless of whether or 
not the subject has been administered study drug. 8.1.1 Severity   
Refer to Appendix 18.2 and Appendix 18.3 for definitions and assessment scales for ocular and 
nonocular/systemic AEs. 
8.1.[ADDRESS_360449] using these explanations: 
• Unexpected : an AE  that is not listed in the IB  or is not listed at the specificity or severity that 
has been observed.  
• Expected : an AE  that is listed in the IB at the specificity and severity that has been observed . 
• Not applicable:  an AE unrelated to the investigational product.  
Adverse events that are mentioned in the IB as occurring with a class of products or as anticipated from the pharmacological/ mechanical (or other) properties of the product, but are not specifically mentioned as occurring with the particular product under investigation are to be considered unexpected. 
The investigator should initially c lassif y the expectedness of an AE, but the final classification  is 
subject to the Medical Monitor’s and Sponsor’s determination.

Protocol GBV -102-002  
Graybug Vision, Inc.  Amendment 3  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page  84 08 September 2020  8.2 Serious Adverse Event  
All AEs will be as sessed as either serious or nonserious. A n SAE  is any event that involves or 
results in any of the following outcomes: 
• Death  
• Life-threatening occurrence (ie, if in the view of the investigator or Sponsor, the event’ s 
occurrence placed the subject at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an 
event which hypothetically might have cause d death if it were more severe)  
• Requires in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] (h ospi[INVESTIGATOR_192968] a pre -existing condition or for surgery planned before study entry is 
not considered an SAE) 
• A persistent or significant disability/incapacity (permanent or substantial disruption of the 
subject ’s ability to perform normal life functions) ; this definition is not intended to include 
experiences of relatively minor or  temporary medical significance  
• Congenital anomaly/birth defect (an AE that occurs in the child or fetus of a subject exposed 
to study drug prior to conception or during pregnancy) 
An important medical event or serious medical condition that does not meet any of the above criteria may be considered an SAE if, based upon appropriate medical judgment, it jeopardizes the subject or requires medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias, or convulsions that do not result in in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
8.3 Study Drug Causality  
The assessing  investigator will assess the relationship of the A E to the study drug or study 
procedure as either related or not related. The following should be taken into consideration when assessing AE causality:  
• Positive temporal relationship to study drug, such as if the study drug was withdrawn and the AE resolved or the event recurred after re-introduction  
• If there is a reasonable possibility that the AE is associated with an un derlying or 
concomitant illness  
• Possible association with previous or concomitant therapy 
• No temporal relationship to the study drug and/or a more likely alternative etiology exists  
• If the AE is direc tly related to study procedures 
GB-102 (Sunitinib Malate)  
Protocol GBV -102-[ADDRESS_360450] at each 
scheduled or unscheduled study visit. At each visit, study personnel should ask the following question: “Have you had any problems since your last visit?” An AE  may also be detected when 
volunteered by [CONTACT_228643], or through physical examination or other assessments. All AEs (serious and nonserious) reported by [CONTACT_228644] a qualified physician participating in the study and must be recorded on the subject’s source documents and AE CRF.  
All SAEs, whether or not related to study drug, must be reported to the Sponsor or Sponsor’s designat ed Pharmacovigilance contact  [CONTACT_228645] 24 hours after the i nvestigator becomes aware of the event.  
If an SAE  occurs, the study center  should immediately notify the Pharmacovigilance at Syneos 
Health  using email notification: [EMAIL_1604]  or 
fax number : [PHONE_1870]. Pharmacovigilance will notify the medical monitor and the 
Sponsor immediately (within 24 hours).  
Alternatively, the investigator may contact [CONTACT_295712]: 
Steven Gross, MD 
Medical Monitor Phone: [PHONE_6175] 
Email: [EMAIL_5845] 
Note that any SAEs that occur after the subject has provided written informed consent, but before administration of study drug and are considered related to a protocol procedur e must also 
be reported to the Sponsor or Sponsor’s designated project manager within 24 hours after the investigator’ s awareness of the event. 
Investigators should not wait to receive additional information to fully document an SAE before reporting the event to the Sponsor or Sponsor’s designated project manager. If only limited information is initially available, follow -up reports are required. Additional relevant informatio n 
such as hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], laboratory test results, or autopsy reports should be provided as soon as these are available.  
8.5 Reporting Serious Adverse Events to Regulatory Agencies  
An AE, whether serious or nonserious, is considered “ unexpected ” if the event is not reported in 
the clinical safety section of the reference document (eg , an IB or package i nsert) or if the event 
is of greater severity or frequency than is reported in the reference document. 
Expedited reporting of SAE s is required for serious events  that are both unexpected based on the 
reference document and consider ed related to the study drug (ie, the relationship cannot be ruled 
out). The Sponsor will determine which SAEs qualify for expedited reporting.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page  89 08 September 2020  9.3 Analysis Populations 
Three analysis sets will be defined as follows: 
• Safety analysis set (SS): Includes all randomized subjects who receive at least one dose of 
study treatment. Analyses will group subjects according to the treatment scheme actuall y 
received.  
• Full analysis set (FAS): Includes all randomized subjects who receive at least one dose of study treatment,  and complete a baseline and at least one post -baseline visit. All data 
collected from subjects who receive rescue treatment during the s tudy will be included in the 
FAS. Subjects will be analyzed according to their assigned treatment . All efficacy analyses 
will be conducted on the FAS and these analyses will be considered primary. 
• Per protocol analysis set (PP): Consists of a subset of the FAS and includes subjects with no 
major protocol violations that would affect the assessment of the primary efficacy endpoint of the study. A nalyses conducted on the PP set will be considered secondary. 
9.[ADDRESS_360454] Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
Continuous summary statistics will be generated for the quantitative demographic variable  
(age, in years), tabulated by [CONTACT_295715]. Discrete summary statistics 
will be generated for qualitative demographic variables ( age category, se x, ethnicity, race, and 
iris color for the study eye ), tabulated by [CONTACT_295715]. 
Baseline clinical characteristics and disease history, such as baseline BCVA, CST, and SD -OCT 
measurements, fluorescein angiography values, and color fundus photography values , will also 
be summarized descriptively by [CONTACT_295716]. 
Medical history will be coded using the current version of MedDRA  at the time of database lock . 
Medical histor y will be summarized using discrete sum mary statistics for each MedDRA  SOC  
and preferred term (PT) by [CONTACT_295715] . Medical history will be 
presented separately for ocular and nonocular conditions. Subjects with multiple medical 
histories in the same SOC or PT will be counted only once for that respective SOC or PT. 
9.[ADDRESS_360455], FA, and CFP. Descriptive summary statistics will be provided and 
exploratory inference testing will be described in the SAP.  
9.6 Efficacy Analyses 
A separate SAP will provide a detailed description of the planned statistical analyses . Efficacy 
parameters will be summarized and analyzed for the FAS (primary population for analysis) and PP (secondary/sensitivity population for analysis). 
GB-102 (Sunitinib Malate)  
Protocol GBV -102-[ADDRESS_360456] rescue treatment (GB -102 only). This would be 
further validated through assessing time  to fulfillment of at least one rescue criterion.  
Time to first rescue treatment/ fulfillment of at least one rescue criterion will be analyzed using 
the Kaplan -Meier method. The probability of remaining rescue treatment free /not fulfilling at 
least one rescue criterion  will be reported for the Month 6 and Month 12 visits with associated 
80% confidence intervals (CI) based on Greenwood’s standard error esti mate. Kaplan -Meier 
curves will be produced. If calculable, estimates of the median time to fulfillment of at least on 
rescue criterion  and the 25th and 75th percentiles will be calculated with corresponding 80% CIs.  
The FAS will be the primary population used for analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint. 
For this analysis, the interval censored nature of the time to first rescue treatment/ fulfillment of  
at least one rescue criterion with regard to the scheduled study visits is considered: If a subj ect 
receives a rescue treatment/ fulfills a rescue criterion during an unscheduled visit, then the subject 
will be considered to have met the event of interest in the visit interval which ends at the next 
scheduled study visit that occurs after the unscheduled visit. Subjects who do not receive rescue medication/fulfill a rescue criterion will be censored on last scheduled study visit recorded for the subject.  
Exploratory comparisons between each GB-[ADDRESS_360457] stratified by [CONTACT_178814] (< 60 letters 
vs ≥ 60 letters), as defined at the time of randomization. The Peto method will be us ed to 
estimate the hazard ratio and asymptotic 80% confidence interval based on the stratified log rank test statistic.  
A primary endpoint analysis will be conducted when all subjects complete the Month 12 (Day  360) visit. 
9.6.[ADDRESS_360458] will be presented by [CONTACT_295692] 80% confidence intervals (CI) for all visits. A similar analysis will be done for absolute values and change in BCVA and CST relative to the time of first rescue treatment (response to rescue treatment) . Time to fulfillment of at least one rescue criterion starting at the 
Month 6 visit through Month 12 will be summarized  using descriptive statistics including 80% 
CIs and will be presented for the number of rescue treatments, number of scheduled treatments, number of total of rescue and scheduled treatments , and number of times that at least one rescue 
criterion is met from baseline through Month 12. 
Absence of exudation (intra -/sub- retinal fluid/cystoid edema),  categories of change from 
Baseline in BCVA, and BCVA worse than 20/200 (Snellen equivalent) will be summarized at 
each visit using discrete summary statistics , including 80% asympt otic normal CIs for each 
treatment scheme. 
GB-102 (Sunitinib Malate)  
Protocol GBV -102-[ADDRESS_360459], total lesion area, CNV lesion area, and fluorescein leakage area will be summarized using 
continuous summary statistics, including 80% CIs around the mean for each treatment scheme, 
as well as the combined GB-[ADDRESS_360460] pre-enrollment value (µm) and change from average pre-enrollment value (µm) at each visit will be similarly summarized.  
For BCVA and CST, c omparisons between each GB -102 group and the aflibercept control group 
and between the combined GB-102 groups and the aflibercept control group will be made primarily for each visit using a linear model adjusting for the baseline value as a covariate /class 
variable and secondarily using 2- sample t- tests.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Exploratory Efficacy Analysis: Extension Study 
All safety and efficacy data collected beyond Month 12 (Day 360) will be  presented in listings 
and summarized as appropriate using descriptive statistics.  
9.7 Safety Analyses 
All safety analyses will be p erformed on the safety analysis set . 
Adverse Events  
The safety of GB -102 will primarily be assessed by [CONTACT_295717]  
(TEAE) . An AE will be considered a TEAE  if it occurs or worsens on or after initiation of study 
drug. An overall summary of TEAEs will be presented including the number of events and the number of subjects with events (along with percentages) by [CONTACT_295718], seriousness, relationship to study drug, and severity. 
All AEs will be coded  to system organ class (SOC) and preferred term (PT) using the current 
version of MedDRA at the time of database lock . The number of TEAEs and the number and 
percentage of subjects with any TEAEs will be tabulated overall and by [CONTACT_295719]. 
The following categories of adverse events will be summarized separately for ocular TEAEs in the study eye, ocular TEAEs in the non-study eye, non-ocular TEAEs, and all TEAEs combined, with full detail provided in the SAP: 
• TEAEs  
• Treatment related TEAEs  
• Serious TEAEs

• Arteriothromboembolic TEAEs using ATC criteria  
Descriptive summaries will be provided for SAEs, S[LOCATION_003]Rs, and AEs leading to study 
discontinuation. 
Plasma Levels of Sunitinib Plasma concentrations will be summarized at each visit using continuous descriptive statistics.  
Other Safety Endpoints  
Study drug exposure, concomitant medication use, physical examination results, vital signs, and 
laboratory results will be summarized by [CONTACT_295714]. 
IOP measurements will be summarized by [CONTACT_295720] r the study eye and for 
the nonstudy eye. The IOP data will be summarized by [CONTACT_295721]. Changes from baseline will also be summarized continuously and discretely. Discrete categories for IOP measurements will include (in mmHg) ≤ 5, 6 to 14, 15 to 21, 22 to 29, and ≥ 30. These categories will be used to summarize results by [CONTACT_295722]. Discrete categories  for changes from 
baseline in IOP will include ≤ −5, −4 to 0, 1 to 4, 5 to 9, 10 to 14, and ≥ 15. The numbers and percentages of eyes with an IOP measurement  ≥ 30 mmHg and the numbers and percentages of 
eyes with an increase from baseline in  IOP measuremen t ≥ [ADDRESS_360461]-

from Baseline to Month [ADDRESS_360463]’ s safety could be  compromised without immediate action. In 
these circumstances, immediate approval of the chairman of the IRB must be sought, and the investigator should inform Graybug Vision and the full IRB within [ADDRESS_360464] receive approval from the IRB prior to their implementation.  
When a protocol amendment substantially alters the study design or the potential risks or burden to subjects, the informed consent document will be amended and approved by [CONTACT_228648]; all active subjects must provide written informed consent using the revised consent form once available. 
Note:  If discrepancies  exist between minor features of the statistical analysis as planned in the 
protocol and as described in the final SAP, a protocol amendment will not be issued and the SAP 
will prevail.

Graybug Vision, Inc.  Amendment 3  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page  94 08 September 2020  10 DATA QUALITY ASSURANCE  
Graybug Vision personnel (or designee) will visit the study center  prior to initiation of the study 
to review with the study center  personnel information about the study drug, protocol and other 
regulatory document requirements, any applicable randomization procedures, source document 
requirements, CRF  completion , monitoring requirements, and procedures for reporting AEs, 
including SAEs. 
At visits d uring and after the study, the Sponsor and/or designee will monitor the study center for 
compliance with regulatory documentation, with a focus on accurate and complete recording of 
data on CRFs from source documents, adherence to protocol, randomization (if applicable), SAE reporting, and drug accountability records. 
A Sponsor- designated  clinical data management group  will design and program a st udy database 
and corresponding CRFs, and will provide training for study centers and clinical research 
associates  (CRA) on data entry and cleaning procedures. The data quality control and analysis 
will be performed by [CONTACT_228621] (or designee), including study monit oring and clinical data 
management, based on a predefined data management plan and a SAP . 
GB-102 (Sunitinib Malate)  
Protocol GBV -102-[ADDRESS_360465] review and approve the completed CRFs to verify their accuracy.  
Electronic CRF  completion guidelines that are approved by [CONTACT_228621], or designee, will 
designate how to appropriately enter data into CRFs from the source documents. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], blank fields are not acceptable. If a field is blank because the item was not done, the field will be marked “N D.” If the item is unknown, the field will be marked “ UNK. ” If the item is not 
applicable, the field will be marked “NA.” 
Discrepancies (ie, queries) will b e generated for suspect data (eg , vital signs that are out of 
expected range, potential protocol com pliance concerns, and date discrepancies) and missing 
data in the clinical database. Some discrepancies will be automatically generated during data entry into the CRFs as potential data quality issues arise. Other discrepancies will be automatically generated after batch validation is executed on the clinical database during which more advanced, cross- panel edit checks are executed. Finally, manual discrepancies may be 
generated by [CONTACT_431], CRAs, the clinical data manager (CDM), or clinical data analy sts as 
the study data is further analyzed during monitoring visits or data listing reviews. All discrepancies will be routed within the clinical database system to the appropriate clinical study staff, typi[INVESTIGATOR_295686]. When these discrepancies are opened within the system on CRF pages that have already been verified  by [CONTACT_295723] i nvestigator, the database system 
will automatically require the CRA to reverify and the investigator to reapprove the applicable pages.  
Graybug Vision policy is that CRF study data must be verifiable to the source data, which necessitates access to all original recordings, laboratory reports, and subject records. In addition, all source data should be attributable (signed and dated). The i nvestigator must therefore agree to 
allow direct access to all source data. Subjects must also allow access to their medical records (ie, records at the study center that  have previous medical history/information), and subjects will 
be informed of this and will confirm their agreement when giving written informed consent. If an investigator or institution refuses to allow access to subject records because of confidentiality, arrangements must be made to allow an “interview ” style of data verification.  
A CRA designated by [CONTACT_228650] t he study center and evaluate the CRFs for completeness and accuracy. If 
necessary, the study cent er’s personnel will be contact[CONTACT_204423]/or clarifications. 
Data that are modified in the clinical database to resolve related discrepancies must be supported in the source documents.

organization, or its designees. A review of the subjects ’ medical records will be performed in a 
manner to ensure that subject confidentiality is adequately maintained. Further details of the study monitoring will be outlined in a monitoring plan.  
Members of Graybug Vision GCP Compliance Department or designees may conduct an audit of a study center at any time during or after completion of the study. The investigator will be informed if an audit is to take place and advised as to the scope of the audit. Representatives of the FDA or other regulatory agencies may also conduct an audit of the study. If informed of such an inspection, the investigator should notify Graybug Vision immediately. The investigator will ensure that the auditors have access to the clinical supplies, study center facilities, original source documentation, and all study files. All inspections and audits will be carried out giving consideration to data protection as well as subject c onfidentiality to the extent that local, state , 
and federal laws apply. 
GB-102 (Sunitinib Malate)  
Protocol GBV -102-[ADDRESS_360468] notify Graybug Vision of any change in the location, disposition, or custody of the study files. The investigator /institution must 
take measures to prevent accidental or p remature destruction of essential documents, that is, 
documents that individually and collectively permit evaluation of the conduct of a study and the quality of the data produced, including paper copi[INVESTIGATOR_44460] (eg, subject charts) , as well 
as an y original source documents that are electronic as required by [CONTACT_82089].  
All study records must be retained for at least [ADDRESS_360469] approval of a marketing application in the US or an ICH region and until (1) there are no pending or contemplated marketing applications in the US or an ICH region or (2) at least [ADDRESS_360470] elapsed since the formal discontinuation of clinical development of the study drug. The investigator /institution 
should retain subject identifiers for at least [ADDRESS_360471] with retention should the investigator/institution be unable to continue maintenance of subject files for the full 15 years. It is the responsibility of Graybug Vision to inform the investigator/institution as to when these documents no longer need to be retained.

Protocol GBV -102-[ADDRESS_360475] Information and Consent  
Written informed consent in compliance with FDA regulations (21 CFR 50.25), the ICH 
document “Guideline for Good Clinical Practice, E6 (R1),” and other applicable local regulations shall be obtained from each subject prior to entering the study or performing any study related procedure. An informed consent  template will be provided by [CONTACT_1034] (or designee) to the 
study centers. The informed consent will be submitted by [CONTACT_295725]. If any modifications to the content are proposed or made by [CONTACT_5243], the informed consent should be reviewed by [CONTACT_1034] (or designee) prior to IRB submission. 
The investigator is responsible for obtaining written informed consent from each subject 
participating in the study. If there are any revisions to the informed consent during the course of the study, all active participating subjects must be re consented using the revised informed 
consent in a timely fashion. 
Written informed consent must be obtained from the subject before any study related screening 
activity or treatment is undertaken that is not part of routine care. This includes, but is not limited to, the performance of diagnostic or therapeutic procedures and the administration of the first dose of the study treatment. All pertinent aspects of the study must be explained to the prospective subject before signing the informed consent. The subject will be informed that participation is  voluntary and he/she can withdraw from the study at any time. The subject wi ll 
be allowed to read the IRB approved informed consent . If a subject is unable to read the consent, 
an impartial witness should be present during the entire informed consent discussion. Once the investigator or designee is assured the subject agrees to participate in the study, the subject will be asked to give consent by [CONTACT_79844]. The informed consent must be signed and dated by [CONTACT_423], and by [CONTACT_28490], and impartial witness (if required). The investigator shall provide a copy of the signed and dated informed consent to the subject. The original shall be maintained in the subject’ s medical records 
at the study center . This document should not be displayed or made accessible to any third party 
except the Sponsor, its designee or regulatory agency representatives. 
If a subject permanently revokes informed consent and declines further observation and/or 
contact, then this must be clearly documented in the subject’s chart and recording of further data will be discontinued.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page  108 08 September 2020  18.2 Nonocular and Systemic Adverse Event Severity Assessment  
The NCI -CTCAE (version 4.03) is a descriptive terminology that will be used to grade the 
severity of nonocular and systemic AEs report ed in this study. 
The NCI -CTCAE displays Grades 1 through 5 with unique clinical descriptions of severity for 
each AE based on this general guideline: 
Grade 1:  Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observation 
only; intervention not indicated 
Grade 2:  Moderate; minimal, local, or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting  
age-appropriate instrume ntal activities of daily living (ADL)*  
Grade 3:  Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3111]; disabling; limited self-care ADL**  
Grade 4:  Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated 
Grade 5:  Death related to an AE  
A semicolon indicates “or” within the above descriptions. A single dash (-) can be used to indicate that a grade is not available. Not all grades are appropriate for all AEs. Therefore, some AEs are listed with fewer than 5 options for grade selection. 
* Instrumental ADL refers to preparing meals, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3112], using the 
telephone, managing money, etc 
** Self-care ADL refers to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking 
medications, and not being bedridden.

The s everity of an ocular AE will be  defined as a qualitative assessment of the degree of 
intensity of an ocular AE  as determined by [CONTACT_72079]/her by [CONTACT_423]. 
The assessment of severity will be  made irrespective of relationship to investigational product or 
seriousness of the event and should be evaluated according to the following scale:  
• Mild: Event is noticeable to the subject, but is easily tolerated and does not interfere with the 
subject ’s daily activities  
• Moderate:  Event is bothersome, possibly requiring additional therapy, and may interfere with 
the subject’s daily activities  
• Severe:  Event is intolerable, necessitates additional therapy or alteration of therapy, and 
interferes with the subject’s daily activities

CONFIDENTIAL  Page  116 08 September 2020  18.7 Protocol Amendment Summary  
This summary includes changes made to Protocol Amendment 3 GBV-102-002 (Version 4.0 
dated 08 September 2020. 
Graybug Vision, Inc. has decided to include an option for subjects completing the GBV-102-002 
Phase 2b ALTISSIMO  (Core  Study) to enter an Extension Study. The Extension Study is 
designed to follow subjects who complete all study visits through Month 12 (Day 360) , complete 
all study assessments at Month 12 (Day 360) including fluorescein angiography, and do not receive a rescue treatment at the Month 12 (Day 360) final study visit on ALTISSIMO  (Core  
Study). Subjects who enter the Extension Study will be followed for safety until administered rescue treatment as per the rescue treatment criteria or until study completion at Month 18 (Day 540). 
Additiona lly, the definition of the primary and secondary endpoints and statistical plans were 
further clarified. In particular, the primary endpoint was updated from probability of receiving 
rescue treatment through Month [ADDRESS_360490] rescue treatment (GB -102 only) in order to 
avoid potential bias in the assessment of the duration of effect. 
Following is a summary of content- oriented changes that were made to each section of the 
protocol, and a brief rationale for these changes.  Minor editorial changes and document 
formatting revisions have not been summarized.

 1 Introduction  
 
This document is a protocol for a human research study. This study will be carried out in accordance with the 
applicable [LOCATION_002] government regulations and Mayo Clinic research policies and procedures.   
1.1 Background 
 
Androgenic alopecia (AGA) is a common, progressi ve hair  loss disorder affecting both sexes with significant 
negative impact on social and psychological well -being. The frequency and severity increases with age, and up 
to 80% of men, and 50% of women are affected by [CONTACT_137142]. (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_137124] 2014) 
(Varothai ) (Bologna  - book)   While men are more frequently affected, the psychological impact is likely to be 
high for  women where the social impact of hair loss is often devastating. Current medical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_137125] l imited to minoxidi l (for men and women) and finasteride  (for men only) 
(Varothai) , but variable responses  and the need for indefinite use  often result in patient fatig ue and suboptimal 
compliance.   (Gupta)   
 Recently, there has been interest in treatments orientated to more biologically regenerative therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], and consequently there have been numerous studies that have demonstrated successful use for platelet rich plasma  
(PRP)  in treating AGA.  (Singhal)  (Maria -Angeliki
) (Gentile)  (Trink)  (Gkini) (Cerveli)  (Uebel) (Greco) 
(Takikawa) (Kang) (Betsi) (Sclafani) (Khatu) (Schiavone)  PRP contains concentrated platelet cells derived from 
autologous whole blood that are believed to activate a cascade of growth factors when injected into an area of poor hair growth that stimulates hair growth . (Jain) (Lubkowska) In this proposal we will examine whether PRP 
therapy provides similar or better hair growing capacity in women compared to  the conventional topi[INVESTIGATOR_137126]. 
1.2 Investigational Agent 
 
Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP)  
 
1.3 Clinical Data to Date 
PRP is an autologous concentration of human platelets in a small volume of plasma that  has a 4- 7 times higher 
platelet concentration than  baseline.(Jain)  (Lubkowska )  (Parsley)  Since activated platelets secrete a number of 
cytokines and growth factors, such as  platelet -derived growth factor, epi[INVESTIGATOR_5169], transforming 
growth factor, and vascular endothelial growth factor, (Ja in) (Lubkowska ) ( Parsley ) PRP may provide an 
attractive therapy to promote hair growth in the declining hair follicle.  
 
Recent investigators have explored the use of PRP as a treatment modality for AGA, with most available studies to date showing positive  results.  (Singhal) (Maria -Angeliki
) (Gentile )  (Trink) (Gkini) (Cerveli)  PRP is 
attractive as a useful treatment for nonscarring alopecia’s such as AGA, because the treatment is safe  and 
adverse effects appear to be negligible. (Singhal) (Maria -Angeliki ) (Gentile )  (Trink) (Gkini) (Cerveli) 
However, the  effect of PRP on hair growth has been studied primarily in men. Studies that include men and 
women usually do not analyze the data according to sex or comment on whether sex differences were observed . 
(Trin k) (Takikawa) (Kang) (Betsi) (Sclafani) (Schiavone) (Gkini) Although s ex differences  are known to exist  
in the incidence, diagnosis and mechanisms leading to AGA, women are understudied ( Farage) (Romanelli) . 
The need to understand hair loss in women is underscored by [CONTACT_137143]/prevent hair loss.  
[ADDRESS_155691] ing PRP treatment for hair loss  identified 14 articles des cribing 
the use of PRP, 12 of which were used for AGA.  (Maria -Angeliki ) This systematic review considered [ADDRESS_155692] concentration  of PRP , dose, frequency, depth of injecti ons, and number of required 
sessions. Variability in evaluation methods also limits accurate comparison  between the studies  (i.e., global 
photographs, phototrichograms, dermascopic images, hair pull test, and manual counting were all reported as 
measurement tools). In addition, these studies predominantly used men.  Very little published data exists for 
PRP use in women with AGA. T he studies that did include women  examined  very low numbers and/or did not 
analyze results according to  sex so that it is not possible to evaluate whether PRP therapy is safe and efficacious 
in women. (Trink) (Takikawa) (Kang) (Betsi) (Sclafani) (Schiavone) (Gkini) Nonetheless, PRP appears to be a 
useful treatment for AGA , particularly in men, and there is an urgent need for randomized controlled studies 
with standardized measurement techniques and reproducible protocols to study clinical efficacy . Considering 
the widespread use of PRP in cosmetic clinics among women and the lack of data on the effect of PRP on hair 
regeneration  in women there is a great need to perform a controlled trial in women. In future studies we would 
like to examine whether PRP is equally effective in men and women and to examine its mechanism of action.  
1.4 Dose Rationale and Risk/Benefits 
 
We will dose PRP in a manner similar to previous trials. (Gentile, Trink, Cerveli)  Fresh PRP will be harvested  
from the individual and their own PRP administered at three time  points, once every 4 weeks  for a totally 
treatment time of 12 weeks . Minoxidil will be used according to  FDA and manufacturer instructions daily for 
12 weeks. 
 Risks associated with  PRP therapy  include possible pain, redness, and/or irritation at the site of injections for up 
to 2- [ADDRESS_155693] injection. P ublished human data indicate  no significant adverse events related to injection of 
PRP into the skin and previous authors utilizing similar protocols reported no infection, fever, hematoma, tissue 
hypertrophy, or major adverse events among the subjects. (Singhal) (Cerveli)
 (Gentile)  (Trink) (Gkini) Known 
possible risks for Minoxidil include chest pain, rapid heartbeat, faintness,  dizziness, sudden or 
unexplained weight gain, swelling of the hands or feet, scalp irritation or redne ss, changes in 
hair color and texture, and unwanted facial hair growth.

 7 Statistical Plan  
7.1 Sample Size Determination  
 
A total of 2 3 patients  will be enrolled in this study.  This sample size will be sufficient in order to gain valuable 
data to be used in the design of a future, larger study. Given the pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268]/feasibility nature of the study, no formal 
power calculations were performed.  
 
7.2 Statistical Methods  
 
Data Analysis – Give n the design, all statistical analysis will be focused on the difference in outcomes, and 
differences in outcomes compared to baseline, for each treatment within individual patients. For continuous or 
ordinal outcome variables, we will use a Wilcoxon signed rank test for comparison of outcomes between PRP 
and Minoxidil , while for categorical outcome variables we will use  McNemar’s exact test for these . Continuous 
outcome measures will be summarized using the sample mean, standard deviation, median, minimum,  25th and 
75th percentiles, and maximum. Categorical variables will be summarized with number and percentage. 95% 
confidence intervals (CIs) will be  estimated where appropriate. P-values of 0.05 or less will be considered as 
statistically significant, however the results of these tests will be interpreted with the low power of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_137132]; more emphasis will be placed on graphical and descriptive summaries than on the results of statistical tests. No adjustment for multiple testing will be made  owing to the exploratory, pi[INVESTIGATOR_137133]. Given the prospective nature of the study, we expect to encounter little if any missing data. However in the event of missing data, no attempt to impute this missing data will be made in this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]; missing data will be treated as missing.  
 
Descriptive Statistics  
 
We will summarize continuous variables using the sample mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, 25th 
and 75th percentiles, and maximum. We will summarize categorical variables with number and percentages. Ordinal variables will be summarized using the s ample median, minimum, 25th and 75th percentiles, and 
maximum, as well as with number and percentage.  
 
Handling of Missing Data  
Given the prospective nature of the study, we expect to encounter little if any missing data. However in the 
event of missing data, no attempt to impute this missing data will be made in this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]; missing data will 
be treated as missing.  
 
Multiplicity  
 
No adjustment for multiple testing will be made owing to the exploratory, pi[INVESTIGATOR_109248]. P -value of 
0.05 or l ess will be considered as statistically significant.  
 
Primary Hypothesis: 
 
We hypothesize that PRP administration for AGA will be safe and without significant complications for the 
patient.  AGA will be comparable in efficacy or superior to  conventional tr eatment with MNX. 
 
14 
 The primary endpoints of the study, occurrence of adverse reactions and morbidity, are both dichotomous 
categorical variables. As such, the proporti on for which these outcomes occur will be estimated along with 95% 
CIs. These proportions will be compared between treatments  using McNemar’s exact test  
  
Interim Analysis  
 
No interim analysis  will be performed in this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799].

8 Safety and Adverse Events  
8.1 Definitions  
 
Unanticipated Problems Involving Risk to Subjects or Others (UPI[INVESTIGATOR_14845])  
Any unanticipated problem or adverse event that meets the following three criteria:  
• Serious : Serious problems or events that result s in significant harm, (which may be physical, 
psychological, financial, social, economic, or legal) or increased risk for the subject or others (including 
individuals who are not research subjects). These include: (1) death; (2) life threatening adverse experience; (3) hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] - inpatient, new, or prolonged; (4) disability/incapacity - persistent or 
significant; (5) birth defect/anomaly; (6) breach of confidentiality and (7) other problems, events, or new information (i.e. publications, DSMB reports, interim findings, product labeling change) that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_14846], safety, or welfare of the subjects or others, or substantially compromise the research data, AND  
• Unanticipated : (i.e. , unexpected) problems or events are those that are not already described as potential 
risks in the protocol, consent document, not listed in the Investigator’s Brochure, or not part of an underlying disease. A problem or event is "unanticipated" when it wa s unforeseeable at the time of its 
occurrence. A problem or event is "unanticipated" when it occurs at an increased frequency or at an increased severity than expected, AND  
• Related: A problem or event is "related" if it is possibly related to the research procedures.  
  
Adverse Event  
 
An untoward or undesirable experience associated with the use of a medical product (i.e. drug, device, biologic) 
in a patient or research subject.  
 
   
Serious Adverse Event  
15 
  
Adverse events are classified as serious or non -serious.  Serious problems/events can be well defined and 
include; 
• death  
• life threatening adverse experience  
• hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
• inpatient, new, or prolonged; disability/incapacity 
• persistent or significant birth  defect/anomaly  
 
or other events that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_37021] -investigator may have adversely affected the rights, 
safety, or welfare of the subjects or others, or substantially compromised the research data.  
 All adverse events that do not meet any of the criteria for serious, should be regarded as non- serious adverse 
events .  
 
Adverse Event Reporting Period  
For this study, the study treatment follow -up period is 12 months  after enrollment. T he adverse event 
monitoring period will end at th e end of the follow -up period. If an event is reported after this time it would not 
be considered study related.  
 Preexisting Condition 
A preexisting condition is one that is present at the start of the study.  A preexisting condition should be 
recorded as  an adverse event if the frequency, intensity, or the character of the condition worsens during the 
study period.  
General Physical Examination Findings 
At screening, any clinically significant abnormality should be recorded as a preexisting condition.  At  the end of 
the study, any new clinically significant findings/abnormalities that meet the definition of an adverse event must 
also be recorded and documented as an adverse event.  
 
Post-study Adverse Event  
All unresolved adverse events should be followed by [CONTACT_456] -investigator until the events are resolved, the 
subject is lost to follow -up, or the adverse event is otherwise explained.  At the last scheduled visit, the sponsor -
investigator should instruct each subject to report, to the sponsor -investig ator, any subsequent event(s) that the 
subject, or the subject’s personal physician, believes might reasonably be related to participation in this study.   
Abnormal Laboratory Values 
A clinical laboratory abnormality should be documented as an adverse event if it was exhibited as a severe 
reaction i.e. swelling, that required hospi[INVESTIGATOR_137134].   
 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], Prolonged Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_137135] a serious adverse event unless specifically instructed otherwise in this protocol.  Any condition 
responsible for surgery should be documente d as an adverse event if the condition meets the criteria for an 
adverse event.   
  
Neither the condition, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], nor surgery are reported as an adverse event in 
the following circumstances:  
16 
 • Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14841] a 
preexisting condition.  Surgery should not  be reported as an outcome of an adverse event if the purpose 
of the surgery was elective or diagnostic and the outcome was uneventful. 
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14842]. 
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14843], unless it is a 
worsening or increase in frequency of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14844].  
 
8.[ADDRESS_155704] seek information on adverse events by [CONTACT_28812], as appropriate, by [CONTACT_5148].  Information on all adverse events should be recorded immediately in the source document, and also in the appropriate adverse event section of the case report form 
(CRF) or separate worksheet.  All clearly related signs, symptoms, and abnormal diagnostic, laboratory or procedure results should recorded in the source document.  All adverse events occurring during the study period must be recor ded.  The clinical course of each event 
should be followed until resolution, stabilization, or until it has been ultimately determined that the study treatment or participation is not the probable cause.  Serious adverse events that are still ongoing at the end of the study period must be followed up, to determine the final outcome.  
8.[ADDRESS_155705] the 
study participant and then complete the Study Adverse Event Worksheet and/or log.  The sponsor -investigator 
will evaluate the event and determine the necessary follow -up and reporting required. 
 
8.3.1 Sponsor -Investigator reporting: notifying the Mayo IRB 
The sp onsor- investigator will report to the Mayo IRB any UPI[INVESTIGATOR_68258]- UPI[INVESTIGATOR_137136]. 8.[ADDRESS_155706] along with consultation between the study team and the IRB.  
8.5 Medical Monitoring  
It is the responsibility of the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_16462]/her site.  This safety monitoring will include careful assessment and appropriate reporting of adverse events as noted above, as w ell 
as the construction and implementation of a site data and safety -monitoring plan (see section 10  “Study 
Monitoring, Auditing, and Inspecting”).  Medical monitoring will include a regular assessment of the number and type of serious adverse events.  
[ADDRESS_155707] of 1996 (HIPAA).  Those regulations require a signed subject authorization informing the subject of the following:  
• What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from subjects in this study 
• Who will have access to that information and why 
• Who will use or disclose that information  
• The rights of a research subject to revoke their authorization for use of their PHI.  
In the event that a subject revokes authorization to collect or use PHI, the investigator, by [CONTACT_5151], retains the ability to use all information collected prior to the revocation of subject authorization.  For subjects that have revoked authorization to collect or use PHI, attempts should be made to  obtain permission to collect at least 
vital status (long term survival status that the subject is alive) at the end of their scheduled study period.  
 Hard copy data such as consent forms will be stored in locked file cabinets; electronic data will be stored in secure web -based database (REDCap) that will be designed with the help of the statistician.  
9.3 Source Documents  
Source data are  all information, original records of clinical findings, observations, or other activities in a clinical 
trial necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the trial.  Source data are contained in source documents.  Examples of these original documents, and data records include: hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], clinical and office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, subjects’ diaries or  evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing records, recorded 
data from automated instruments, copi[INVESTIGATOR_10379], microfiches, photographic negatives, microfilm or magnetic media, x -rays, s ubject files, and records 
kept at the pharmacy, at the laboratories, and at medico- technical departments involved in the clinical trial.  
 
Data Management 
Study data will be managed in a study specific REDCap system  
 
Data Security and Confidentiality  
 
The REDCap system has built in systems for control of access, data integrity and audit trails. Access and 
confidentiality are controlled in a manner similar to other institutional systems.  
9.[ADDRESS_155708] case histories and regulatory documents.  The sponsor-investigator will retain the specified records and reports for whichever is longer ;

 10 Study Monitoring, Auditing, and Insp ecting  
10.1 Study Monitoring Plan 
The investigator will allocate adequate time for such monitoring activities.  The Investigator will also ensure 
that the monitor or other compliance or quality assurance reviewer is given access to all the study -related 
documents and study related facilities (e.g. pharmacy, diagnostic laboratory, etc.), and has adequate space to conduct the monitoring visit.  The study specific DSMP will be submitted to the IRB as a separate document in the IRB application.  
 This study will be monitored on a routine basis during the conduct of the trial.  The Mayo Clinic Office of Research Regulatory Support will assist in coordination of the clinical monitoring for the trial as a service for the sponsor -investigator.  Clinical trial monitoring r equires review of the study data generated throughout the 
duration of the study to ensure the validity and integrity of the data along with the protection of human research subjects.  This will assist sponsor-investigators in complying with Food and Drug A dministration regulations.  
10.2 Auditing and Inspecting  
The investigator will permit study -related monitoring, audits, and inspections by [CONTACT_1201], the sponsor, and 
government regulatory agencies, of all study related documents (e.g. source documents, regulatory  documents, 
data collection instruments, study data etc.).  The investigator will ensure the capability for inspections of applicable study -related facilities (e.g. pharmacy, diagnostic laboratory, etc.).  
 Participation as an investigator in this study imp lies acceptance of potential inspection by [CONTACT_137147].  
[ADDRESS_155709] (IRB), in agreement with local legal prescriptions, for formal approval of the study.  The decision of the IRB concerning the conduct of the study will be made in writing to the sponsor -investigator before commencement 
of this study.  All subjects for this study will be provided a consent form describing this study and providing sufficient information for subjects to make an informed decision about their participation in this study.  This consent form will be submitted with the protocol for review and approval by [CONTACT_14884].

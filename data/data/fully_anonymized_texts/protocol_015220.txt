Development of a Pregnancy -Specific Screening Tool  
 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED] 
 
Document Date: August 1, [ADDRESS_715926] and registered in ClinicalTrials.gov ( [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) . We prospectively 
enrolled adult pregnant , nulliparous and multiparous  subjects, between 24 and 35 
weeks gestation from a university -affiliated prenatal clinic. Women were included if they 
had a BMI > 40 kg.m-2 at the time of enrollment and were 18 years or older. The World 
Health Organization classification of obesity was u tilized to define class 3 (extreme) 
obesity.1 Women with an established diagnosis of OSA or chronic opi[INVESTIGATOR_15834], and 
subjects who did not speak English were excluded.  
Follow ing informed consent, demographic data was recorded (including pre -
pregnancy BMI from chart review) and subjects completed three sleep disordered 
breathing screening questionnaires: the Berlin2 (BQ) and STOP -BANG3,4 
questionnaires, and the American Society of Anesthesiologists’ (ASA) checklist.5 
Subjects also completed the Epworth Sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_7110] (ESS) which is used to assess 
sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_547233].[ADDRESS_715927] using the method proposed for use in pregnant women by [CONTACT_547237].2  
OSA risk score = Age + BMI pre-pregnancy + 15 (if frequent snoring) + 15 (if chronic hypertension)  
The BQ, STOP -BANG, and ASA questionnaires, as well as the ESS were scored 
using published methods.2,5-7 The BQ cont ains 10 items classified into three categories: 
Category 1 concerns snoring; Category 2 concerns daytime sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008]; and Category 3 
relates to BMI > [ADDRESS_715928] 
contains 12 -items in three categories: clinical signs and symptoms; history of apparent 
airway obstruction du ring sleep; and somnolence. If [ADDRESS_715929] total possible score in this 
cohort equal to 6 (as male gender and age greater than 50 years do not apply to any of

Study data w ere entered into and managed using REDCap electronic data 
capture tools hosted at Duke University. REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) 
is a secure, web -based application designed to support data capture for research 
studies, providing: 1) an intuitive inter face for validated data entry; 2) audit trails for 
tracking data manipulation and export procedures; 3) automated export procedures for 
seamless data downloads to common statistical packages; and 4) procedures for 
importing data from external sources.[ADDRESS_715930] by [CONTACT_547238]4 and thyromental distance, and to 
assess retrognathia, tongue scallopi[INVESTIGATOR_007]10, Mallampati score  (MMS)11, mod ified MMS12, 
tonsil size and lateral pharyngeal wall narrowing. MMS is a [ADDRESS_715931] (ApneaLink 
Air, ResMed, Poway, CA, [LOCATION_003]), and instructions for wearing it during one night of 
sleep. The home sleep test consi sts of a pulse oximeter for recording of oxygen 
saturation and heart rate, a respi[INVESTIGATOR_547235], 
and a nasal sensor for detection of flow limitation, apnea hypopnea index (AHI)  and 
snoring. The software on the dev ice calculates AHI from the sum average number of 
apneas (80% -100% reduction in airflow with respi[INVESTIGATOR_21266] > 10 seconds) and 
hypopneas (50% -80% reduction in airflow with respi[INVESTIGATOR_21266] > 10 seconds) per hour 
during the recording time, based on the  standard definitions of the American Academy 
of Sleep Medicine. The software also generates a report with details regarding variation 
in oxygen saturation during the study. Subjects with an AHI greater than [ADDRESS_715932] were referred to a sleep medicine physician for further evaluation.     
 
Pregnancy outcomes were followed for all subjects, including maternal death, 
gestational diabetes, cerebrovascular accident, spontaneous labor, induction of labor, 
oxytoc in administration during la bor, cesarean delivery, estimated blood loss, neonatal 
weight , and composite outcomes of adverse maternal cardiovascular and peripartum 
events, and adverse fetal outcomes. A composite adverse maternal cardiovascular 
outcome combined cases of: gestational h ypertension; mild and severe preeclampsia; 
eclampsia;  cardiomyopathy ; and congestive heart failure. A  composite adverse 
peripartum outcome  included cases of: postpartum hemorrhage; maternal ICU 
admission;  and post -operative wound infections . A composite ad verse fetal outcome 
included cases of: neonatal intensive care unit admission; fetal growth restriction; 
preterm delivery (< 37 weeks gestation); and fetal demise.  
 
Statistical analysis  
OSA outcome was defined as AHI ≥ [ADDRESS_715933] 2 hours of nasal air flow time recorded. This measure was chosen to assess 
outcome because it represents the threshold for referral for in laboratory PSG  and an 
OSA screening measure will need to be able to sensitively and specifically indicate 
when a referral for PSG  is needed. We summarized the patient demographic, physical, 
and clinical characteristics as well as questionnaire responses in each outcome group 
via mean (SD) or median (Q1, Q3) for numeric variables and N (%) for categorical 
variab les. We assessed univariate associations of patient characteristics and 
questionnaire responses with OSA outcome via t -test or Wilcoxon rank sum test for 
numeric variables, and chi -square or Fisher exact test for categorical variables.  
 
We assessed the per formance and agreement of the previously defined OSA risk 
scores via receiver operating curve (ROC) area under the curve (AUC) analysis, logistic 
regression, and Kendall Tau correlation for the numeric scores, and via sensitivity and 
specificity, net recla ssification indices (NRI) and Kappa statistics for the binary risk 
stratification.  
 
We designed the study with an expectation of an OSA positive rate of 30 -40% in 
our high -risk population.1,2 A study of 80 patients (24 -32 with OSA) with completed valid 
home sleep test, achieves 79% power in a logistic regression with two -sided alpha=0.[ADDRESS_715934] an odds ratio  of 2.5 for a numeric risk score when the OSA rate is 35%. For 
the Kappa statistic used to assess agreement, with 80 subjects  and an OSA rate of 
35%, we will achieve 82% power at alpha = 0.[ADDRESS_715935] the difference between a 
kappa of 0.45 (fair agreement) and 0.75 (strong agreement). Power and sample size 
calculation were performed in NQuery (Statistical Solutions Ltd) softwar e, statistical 
analysis was performed in SAS v9.4 (SAS Inc., Cary, NC), and significance was set at 
0.05 level.

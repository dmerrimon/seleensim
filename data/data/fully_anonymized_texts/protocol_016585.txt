Sponsor Adaptimmune  
Study Centers Two Centers: University of Maryland  Greenebaum  Cancer Center; 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_145051]  A Phase I/II, study. Patients with advanced myeloma and who are candidates 
for autologous stem cell transplants , or syngeneic stem cell transplants 
(SSCT), will be eligible.  Prior to full screening on this study, patients will 
undergo prescreening to evaluate HLA -A type and presence of NYESO -
1/LAGE antigen.  
7-14 days after PCV (pneumococcal conjugate vaccine) immunization #1 all 
patients (or donors in the case of SSCT) will initially undergo a  steady-state 
mononuclear cell apheresis  for T cell collection, with an opti onal second 
collection.  Once mononuclear cells have been collected, patients (or donors 
in the case of SSCT)  will then undergo hematopoietic stem cell mobilizatio n. 
All patients will then receive high -dose melphalan followed by 
[CONTACT_145106] 0. On day +2, patients wi ll receive 
a dose of >0.1-1 x 1010 anti-CD3/anti-CD28-costimulated autologous T cells  
which have been genetically modified to express high affinity NYESO -1 
TCRs.  A minimum dose of 0.1- 1 x 109 will be permitted, but patients 
receiving this low dose level will be evaluated separately for safety and 
efficacy. PCV immunizations #2, 3 and 4 will be given at days 14, 42, 90.  
At day 100, patients will start lenalidomide maintenance.   
 
Patients will undergo myeloma restaging at days +42, +100, [ADDRESS_165984] 
infusion for delayed gene therapy adverse events. From the time of their 
disease progression, patients will enter long- term follow-up (LTFU) phase 
and continue to be monitored for gene therapy  delayed adverse events as per 
original schedule.  Subjects who are still alive will be consented to the LTFU 
protocol ADP-0000-002.

2 INTRODUCTION AND RATIONALE FOR INVESTIGATIONAL AGENTS  
 
2.1 Autologous Stem Cell Transplants (ASCT) for Myeloma  
 
Although allogeneic (donor) stem cell transplants can eradicate myeloma through a T -cell 
mediated “graft vs. myeloma” (GVM) effect (Tricot et al., 1996; Lokhorst et al., 2004) , 
toxicities can be prohibitive.  High- dose chemotherapy followed by [CONTACT_145109]  
(ASCT) induces complete responses in about 20- 40% of patients but cures are rare due in part 
to the lack of a GVM effect (Barlogie et al., 1997; Child et al., 2003).  Retrospective studies suggest that better clinical outcomes from auto -transplantation for myeloma and other 
hematologic neoplasms may be associated with more rapid lymphocyte recovery during the early post-transplant period (Porrata et al., 2001; Porrataet al., 2004). In addition, myeloma -
reactive T-cells have been detected at low frequencies in the marrow or blood of untreated 
myeloma patients  (Dhodapkar et al., 2002; Noonan et al., 2005).  Thus, strategies to augment 
the recovery and function of autologous T- cells post-transplant may be beneficial.  
 
2.[ADDRESS_165989] -transplant immune suppression including prolonged depletion of 
CD4+ T-cell numbers and function and altered dynamics of immune cell recovery (e.g. 
inversion of CD4/CD8 ratios) clearly increase the risk for serious infections with varicella -
zoster virus (VZV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), and S. pneumonia (Hoyle et al., 1994; Ketter et 
al., 1999).  Indeed, the [ADDRESS_165990] -transplant (Dykewicz et al., 2001).  Unfortunately, immunogenicity for this 
vaccine is limited, with only 19% of patients achieving potentially protective antibody levels at 
 
Protocol  [ADDRESS_165991] -transplant (Guinan et al., 1994) .  A protracted delay in immune reconstitution 
following autologous stem cell transp lantation may help to explain this pattern of defective 
immune responses (Anderson et al., 1990; Guillaume et al., 1998).   
 
2.[ADDRESS_165992]-transplant Immunotherapy ; clinical data supporting the rationale for the design of 
this study 
2.3.1 Results of GCC-0065/UPCC-6401:   
 Randomized Study of Combination Immunotherapy using Costimulated Autologous T- cells and pre 
and post-transplant Immunizations using the Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine (PCV, Prevnar®) 
 
We hypothesized that improved T -cell recovery through intravenous infusion of ex -vivo 
costimulated autologous T-cells might provide a platform for post- transplant immunotherapy 
of myeloma and enhance protection from post -transplant infections.  Autologous T -cells were 
stimulated by [CONTACT_145110] h anti-CD3 and anti -CD28 
monoclonal antibodies had been conjugated because signals through CD3 and CD28 can prevent T cell anergy (Li et al., 1999; Boussiotis et al., 2000).To test this hypothesis, a 
randomized clinical trial was conducted jointly at the U niversity of Maryland Greenebaum 
Cancer Center and the University of Pennsylvania Abramson Cancer Center in which 54 patients with myeloma received infusions of costimulated autologous T -cells after 
autotransplantation along with immunizations using the pn eumococcal conjugate vaccine 
(PCV) (Rapoport, 2005).  The following observations were made from this trial:   
 
1. Infusions of 5- [ADDRESS_165993]-transplant infusions of costimulated T -cells were well -tolerated with 
patients experiencing the following common toxicities:  grade I/II chills and rigors (~50% of patients affected); grade I -III fevers (27% of patients affected); 
grade I/II na usea (15% of patients affected).  Uncommon toxicities included 
hypertension (8%, grade I -III), hypotension (4%, grade I), pain/headache (8%, 
grade I), and hypoxia (6%, grades I- III).   
3. The group of patients who were randomly assigned to receive3 PCV immunizations [including one pre -transplant and two post -transplant (at days 
30 & 90)] along with an “early” infusion of vaccine -primed costimulated T -
cells, exhibited robust and sustained antibody responses to the pneumococcal saccharide antigens and robust T -cell responses to the vaccine carrier protein 
(CRM-197).   
4. The group of CMV seropositive patients who were randomly assigned to receive costimulated T -cells “early” (day 12) after transplant exhibited 
enhanced recovery of CMV- directed CD8 T -cell responses.   
 
In addition, a smaller multicenter study of costimulated T -cells after autotransplantation for 
myeloma showed that infusions of 5- 10 x 10
10 T-cells on day 3 of transplantation were well -

tolerated without grade 3 or 4 infusional toxicities (Vij et al., 2003) .   When compared to 
historical controls, these infusions led to significantly higher lymphocyte and CD4 counts as early as day [ADDRESS_165994] focused on i) myeloma cell preparations, ii) 
myeloma-specific antigens (e.g. myeloma/idiotype protein), and iii) myeloma -associated 
antigens.  Candidate whole cell vaccines include mixtures of irradiated autologous m yeloma 
cells and GM -CSF-secreting K562 by[CONTACT_145111] (Borrello et al.,2004.)  as well as fusions of 
autologous myeloma cells and autologous dendritic cells (Vasir et al.,2005; Raje et al.,2004; Rosenblatt et al, 2010).  Other novel strategies for augmenti ng the immunogenicity of 
myeloma cells may include enzymatic synthesis of α-gal epi[INVESTIGATOR_145053] -Gal antibodies followed by [CONTACT_145112]-presenting cells (Galili, 2004) .  Vaccines consisti ng ofidiotype myeloma protein or 
idiotype-pulsed dendritic cells have generated anti -idiotype T-cell and B-cell responses in 
about 20% of vaccinated patients and perhaps rare clinical responses (Reichardt et al., 1999; Titzer et al., 2000).While investigat ion into clinically effective myeloma vaccines continues, 
current data supports the merit for alternative approaches for augmenting tumor specific immunity, such as gene -modified T-cell therapy to provide better cellular targeting against 
myeloma tumor tar gets.

10 cells); ii)  
T cell transfers occurred at day +[ADDRESS_165996] -transplant to take greater advantage of endogenous 
homeostatic lymphocyte expansion mechanisms (e.g. increased IL -15, IL-7 levels);  iii)  HLA 
A2+ patients received pre- and post-transplant immunizations using a multi- peptide tumor 
antigen vaccine composed of HLA -A2 – restricted peptides derived from hTERT and survivin 
and CMV.  hTERTis an attractive target for immunotherapy because it is widely expressed in myeloma cells and immunologic escape through mutation or down- regulation may be incompatible with 
long-term survival of neoplastic cells. In addition, telomerase expression and function may be 
necessary for survival of clonogenic myeloma stem cells  which may ordinarily escape ablation 
 
Protocol  [ADDRESS_165997] of allogeneic stem cell 
transplants for myeloma indicates that these neoplastic “stem cells” are susceptible to 
immunotherapy.    The multipeptide tumor antigen vaccine was comprised of three hTERT peptides including I540 (ILAKFLHWL)  (Vonderheide et al.,1999), R572Y (YLFFYRKSV) and D988Y 
(YLQVNSLQTV)  (Scardion et al.,2002)  the Sur1M2 (LMLGEGLKL) peptide derived from 
the anti-apoptotic protein survivin which is overexpressed in a broad range of malignancies 
including myeloma and which may confer a poor prognosis (Anderson et al.,2001) and a CMV 
control peptide (Mclaughlin -Taylor et al.,2001).  The multipeptide tumor antigen vaccine was 
given to HLA- A2+ patients (ARM A) at 4 timepoints:  i) ~ 10 days before steady -state T cell 
collection; ii) day +[ADDRESS_165998] -transplant; iii) day +[ADDRESS_165999] -transplant; and iv) day +[ADDRESS_166000] -
transplant.  All patients (HLA -A2 positive and negative) received the Prevnar® pneumococcal 
conjugate vaccine at these same timepoints.    Among the observations from this trial was that rapid and robust T cell recovery (CD4+ & CD8+) occurred by [CONTACT_4475] +[ADDRESS_166001] -transplant and this pattern of recovery was signi ficantly 
improved compared to the  earlier trial (Rapoport et al.,2005) in which costimulated T cells 
were transferred at day +[ADDRESS_166002]- transplant.  Day +2 s erum IL-15 levels correlated 
significantly and positively to day  +14 T cell counts.  Notably, a  proportion of patients (~16%) 
developed an early and clinically significant form of autologous  GVHD (graft-vs-host-
disease) which required a short course of systemic steroids in most cases.   This clinical syndrome may be due to a significant shift in the balance of T effector cells (Teff) and T regulatory cells (Treg) leading to an increase in the Teff/Treg  ratio – a mechanism which may 
be necessary for effective cancer immunotherapy.  These observations formed the basis for a recent paper (Rapoport et al., 2009).    The combination of enhanced immune cell recovery and reduced self -tolerance following 
high-dose therapy and adoptive transfer of activated autologous T cells may also promote the 
development of clinically significant immune responses to cancer vaccines.  I mmunoassays 
which were performed showed that of 28 total ARM A (HLA A2 positive) patients analyzed 
to date, 10 patients (36%) had positive tetramer responses at one or more time -points after 
immunization, defined as tetramer staining by [CONTACT_4133] > 0. 1% (and >3-fold increase 
vs. enrollment/baseline). Using  a larger number of patients (54) the relatively high frequency 
and robust anti-pneumococcal antibody and T -cell responses that were reported previously 
with early transfers of vaccine -primed and cost imulated auto logous T cells (Rapoport et 
al.,2005) have been confirmed.  These data have been recently reported (Rapoport et al, 2010).   
 The mean and median numbers of T cells infused were 4.26x10
10 and 4.54 x1010 respectively, 
(range, 1.59 – 5.0).  The mean CD4/CD8 ratio was 2.48 (range, 0.62- 11.09).  The day +2 T 
cell transfers were well -tolerated with common adverse effects being chills/rigors, 
nausea/vomiting and low grade fevers (see Table 2.3.2 below with events separated by [CONTACT_145114], A=A2+, B =A2-).  All early infusion -related toxicities were grade I/II.  Later 
toxicities which were possibly, probably, or definitely considered to be related to the T cell infusions are also tabulated (see Table 1  below).  These toxicities, also mainly grade I/II,

included mild maculopapular rashes (typi[INVESTIGATOR_145054]/scalp/neck/upper chest, fevers, arthralgias, myalgias and conjunctivitis which was readily responsive to glucocorticoid eyedrops.  One patient ha d incomplete platelet recovery (grade III) (~ 40 -50,000/mcl at [ADDRESS_166003]-transplant) considered to be possibly  related to the T -cell infusion. There were 
no documented cases of autoantibody formation (e.g. ANA, thyroid antibodies) or autoimmune endocrinopathies.

To determine whether the early lymphocyte recovery which followed day +[ADDRESS_166004] on hematopoietic recovery, we compared the times to absolute neutrophil counts (ANC) > 500/mcl for [ADDRESS_166005] autografts without additional T cells  Gojo et al., 2006.  The median number of days to neutrophil recovery in the 
current trial was 12 days [range 10- 18] versus 12 days in the historical cohort [P = 0.49].  
 
Protocol  [ZIP_CODE] 
Version 12.0   Page 19 of 118 
 
Similarly, the median days to an unsupported platelet count > 20,000/ mcl was similar for the 
two populations: 14 days [range 0- 28] in the current trial versus 14.5 days in the historical 
cohort [P = 0.78].    
 Seven patient s developed a post -transplant T cell “engraftment syndrome” characterized by 
[CONTACT_145115] (up to 2000 cc/day), abdominal pain, and fever (in six of the patients).  In six patients this syndrome developed at a median of [ADDRESS_166006] -transplant (range 9 -17 days) 
while in one patient  it occurred around day [ADDRESS_166007] -transplant.  Two patients (including one 
who developed GI GVHD) developed early bright facial rashes at about day +[ADDRESS_166008] -
transplant.  The mean day 14 CD4 count for the 7 patients who developed ea rly GVHD-like 
T cell engraftment syndromes was 2443 (range 863 – 4049) while the mean day 14 CD8 count 
for this subset of patients was 5822 (range 671 – [ZIP_CODE]).  There were no significant differences 
in the CD4 and CD8 counts for the subset of patients who developed early “GVHD” versus 
the group of patients who did not.   
 
All 7 patients with apparent “GI -GVHD” had colonoscopic biopsies at a median of [ADDRESS_166009]-transplant (range, 15- 81):  In 6 patients the biopsies were interpreted to show 
histopathologi c grade II-III GVHD of the gut.  The biopsy for the patient with late onset 
symptoms was considered to be non- specific, although intraepi[INVESTIGATOR_145055].  All 7 patients were initially treated with 1 -2 mg/kg of 
methylprednisolone and/or oral budesonide followed by a rapid taper over about 1 month and exhibited rapid and complete clinical responses.  
 
Four patients, including 3 patients who also had GI GVHD and a fourth patient with no GI symptoms, developed early skin rashes including generalized erythroderma or b right facial 
rashes at about day +[ADDRESS_166010]-transplant.  A biopsy of one of these rashes showed typi[INVESTIGATOR_145056], basal vacuolization and CD3+ T cell infiltration of the dermis and epi[INVESTIGATOR_145057] a second patie nt with facial rash alone 
showed a follicular and eccrine duct -centric infiltration of lymphocytes in the superficial 
dermis.  These rashes res olved in about 1 week with (1 patient ) or without (3 patients ) systemic 
glucocorticoids.     
2.4 Cancer testes antigens in multiple myeloma  
 
Cancer-testis antigens (CT antigens)  are proteins with restricted expression in testicular germ 
cells and placenta, and are not normally expressed in other tissues o f the body except in 
various cancers (Caballero and Chen, 2009).  Many of these genes are encoded as multigene families on the X chromosome, including the MAGE -A and NY-ESO-1 antigens, and are 
accordingly called the “CT -X” antigens.  CT antigens were first  described in malignant 
melanoma as targets for cytotoxic T cells and humoral immunity. Specific members of the CTAg family including MAGE -A1, MAGE-A3, MAGE-A4, CT-[ADDRESS_166011] been 
shown to be overexpressed in myeloma as well (Dhodapkar et al.,2003).  CT antigens are attractive targets for tumor vaccines or redirected T cell gene therapy due to their tumor -
specific expression patterns.

2.4.1 NY-ESO-1 and relevance to myeloma  
 
NY-ESO-1 was originally identified as a human tumo r antigen by a method called s erological 
expression cloning of recombinant  cDNA libraries from human tumo rs (SEREX) (Chen, et 
al., 1997). The function of NY -ESO is unknown.  NY -ESO-1expression is detected in testis, 
ovary and weakly in uterus specimens. No mRNA can be detected by [CONTACT_937] -PCR in any other 
normal tissue  (Chen et al., 1997) . In multiple myeloma, expression figures vary widely 
depending on the study, with up to 80% of patients positive for the antigen, but the majority of reports quote figures of <50%.  Expression increases in relapsed patients, and reaches 100% in patients with advanced disease and abnormal cytogenetics (approximately a third of the total patient population).  A summary of the literature covering NY -ESO expression in 
myeloma is shown in Table 2.4.2. Of note, NY- ESO-1 (also known as LAGE -2) is very similar 
in sequence to LAGE -1, and both antigens contain the epi[INVESTIGATOR_9230] (SLLMWITQC) recogniz ed by 
[CONTACT_145116].  Therefore, both NY -ESO and LAGE -1 
expression levels are shown in the table.  
 
In addition to myeloma, solid tumors express NY -ESO at rates of up to 50%: bladder, 
melanoma, lung, ovarian, uterine and esophageal cancer (Chen et al, 1997) .  Expression 
increases with tumo r stage.  Reported expression rates vary between different stu dies; RT-
PCR is more sensitive than IHC, and tends to give higher figures for NY -ESO expression.  
Figures derived from IHC are more reliable, since this technique detects protein rather than RNA. CTL recogniz ing the A2 presented epi[INVESTIGATOR_145058] -ESO

grown from the blood and lymph nodes of myeloma  patients by [CONTACT_145117] (van 
Rhee et al., 2005; Atanackovic et al., 2007) .  LAGE-1, a highly homologous TAA with an 
identical expression pattern, also shares the same epi[INVESTIGATOR_9230].  T  cell clones specific for this

2.[ADDRESS_166012] antigens, and that natural immune responses are associated 
with improved survival in a  variety of cancers (Smyth, Dunn, and Schreiber, 2006). The central problem is 
tolerance: the repertoire of TCRs is general ly of too low avidity to  efficiently recognize tumor antigens, and 
this explains the failure of mo st cancer vaccines (Greenberg and Riddell, 1999; Rosenberg, Yang and 
Restifo, 2004; Pardoll and Allison, 2004) . To address this issue we have worked with Dr . B. Jakobsen at 
Adaptimmune Ltd to develop high affinity TCRs. Results recently published in Nature Medicine present our 
exciting results using high affinity TCRs to improve the immune response to HIV20, and these TCRs are 
currently under investigation in a  clinical trial at UPenn . Higher affinity recognition allows T cells to respond 
to lower levels of antigen; this is critically important for tumor immunotherapy where the tumor 
microenvironment has adapted itself to reduce expression of antigen and also de crease expressio n of MHC 
class I molecules (Marincola et al , 2000; Barrett and Blazar, 2009). 
 To date at least [ADDRESS_166013] been opened for TCR redirected T cells to date ( Table 2.5), and are at various 
stages of completion.  Of these, two have been published (Morgan et al, 2006 and Johnson et al, 2009).  These studies evaluated three different TCRs isolated from tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, and chosen based 
on medium or high affinity binding to HLA -peptide complexes (Johnson et al, 2006).  In the first trial 
evaluating medium affinity MART -1 DMF4 TCRs (identifier number: [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]), 17 subjects were 
reported (to date, [ADDRESS_166014] been enrolled).  Subjects received as high as 6 x 10
10 antigen specific redirected T 
cells.  No toxicity related to T cell infusions was reported.  
 In two other studies, (identifier numbers: NCT0050946 and [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) the higher affinity MART -1 
DMF5 and gp100 (154) TCRs were evaluated in 20 and 16 subjects, respectively (Johnson et al, 2009).  In 
the case of these trials, 29 of 36 subjects developed an erythematous skin rash that subsided within 48 hours 
and was treated with local application of steroids.  The reaction was an “on target” reaction of the TCRs 
against low levels of MART -1 and gp100 antigen that was present on normal melanocytes.  The response 
rate was correspondingly higher in this study than in the previous MART -1 DMF4 study (30% and 19% 
compared to 13%).  There was a correlation between the response rate and persistence of functional TCR redirected T cells.   
 Of note, the NY -ESO-1 receptor that is proposed for use in Cohort 2 patients in this trial has already been 
used in the clinic (clinicaltrials.gov identifier [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).  Results from this trial were recently published (Robbins et al, 2011).  Eleven patients with melanoma and 6 patients with synovial sarcoma were 
enrolled.  Patients were HLA -A2 and the tumors expressed NY -ESO-1 as assessed by [CONTACT_937] -PCR, 
immunohistochemistry, or serum reactiv e antibody.  No adverse events were reported .  Objective responses  
were found in 5/11 melanoma patients, and objective partial responses were observed in  4/6 synovial

sarcoma patients.  Ongoing complete responses >1.5 year were found in 2 patients and at 9 months in one 
patient with melanoma and a 1 .5 year partial response was observed in one patient with synovial cell 
carcinoma.

2.6 Generation and preclinical testing of high affinity TCRs targeting NY- ESO-1 antigen 
2.6.1 Design of Study Drugs: NYESO- 1 TCR 
 
Isolation and validation of NYESO- 1 specific TCR  
TCR gene cDNA sequences were isolated from the NY -ESO HLA -A*0201- SLLMWITQC  
restricted T cell clone 1G4 (Jager E. et al., 1998). NOTE: the SLLMWITQC peptide sequence is 
the identical sequence as is expressed by [CONTACT_145122], and therefore LAGE antigen positive tumors are also targeted by [CONTACT_941] 1G4 T cell clone. The cDNA coding sequences for the 
mature extracellular regions of the α and β chain TCR proteins were cloned into separate E.coli  
plasmid vectors and expressed as protein inclusion bodies. These inclusion bodies were purified and solubilized in protein denaturant then refolded as soluble α/β heterodimeric TCR protein 
(sTCR) by [CONTACT_2900]. Both TCR chains were genetically truncated at the C terminus immediately

before the native intra- chain cysteine residues. The refolded TCR chains were joined together 
by [CONTACT_145123] α and β chain TCR constant 
regions. The 1G4 sTCR protein was purified by [CONTACT_145124]. Its HLA peptide antigen binding kinetics were analyzed by [CONTACT_145125] (SPR) using a BIAcore 3000. The 1G4 gene sequences were then chosen for antigen binding affinity enhancement by [CONTACT_145126]/enrichment from gene libraries of bacteriophage displaying large numbers of mutated 1G4 TCR proteins.  
 
Production of HLA-A*0201- SLLMWITQC antigen complex  
The HLA-A*0201- SLLMWITQC  peptide antigen complex was required for validation of the 1G4 
T cell clone and sTCR validation, as well as for phage display based affinity enhancement. This 
complex was made in -house by [CONTACT_145127] β2m into E.coli  expression vectors. 
These proteins were then expressed separately as inclusion bodies prior to solubilisation, mixing 
with the SLLMWITQC peptide and refolding by [CONTACT_2900]. Refolded antigen complex was then purified by [CONTACT_145128]. Where required this complex wa s 
further modified by C- terminal enzymatic biotinylation.  
 
NY-ESO sTCR affinity enhancement  
A 1G4 sTCR phage display library was constructed with mutations covering the hypervariable 
complementarity determining region (CDR3 region) of the β chain Three rou nds of selection/ 
enrichment for high affinity TCR clones were performed using streptavidin magnetic beads coated 
with biotinylated HLA -A*0201- SLLMWITQC  complex. Competition ELISAs screens for high 
affinity mutant TCR phage identified several TCR β-chain CDR3 mutations. These high affinity 
β chain mutants then formed the basis of a library where the CDR3 α chain was also mutated. 
This complex library was then used to isolate still higher affinities. Further mutations were later introduced into the CDR2 regions of both chains and these libraries then re- selected (Li Y. et al., 
2005). Further CDR2- only high affinity 1G4 TCRs were identified by [CONTACT_63358] (Dunn S. et 
al., 2006)  
Biochemical validation of the affinity enhanced NYESO- 1 sTCR clones  
High affinity mutant TCR chain genes were cloned separately into E.coli  expression vectors. 
These mutant TCR chains were expressed and refolded in various paired combinations including 
with wild type chains. They were then purified and analyzed for binding to HLA -A*0201-
SLLMWITQC  antigen by [CONTACT_145129]. Selected data showing the binding kinetics for several mutant 
TCRs is presented in Table 2.6.2(1) (see also Zhao et al., 2007).

Optimization of mutant NYESO -1 mTCR sequences to obtain affinities useful for 
adoptive T cell therapy.  
Studies with T cells transfected with high affinity TCRs indicated that a range of TCR with intermediate affinity should be evaluated (Zhao et al., 2007). To do this, the high affinity 
mutant CDR3 α chain TCR sequences of Li et al., (ibid) and mutant CDR2 β chain TCR 
sequences of Dunn et al.,(ibid) were partially back- mutated to the wild -type 1G4 TCR 
sequence. A panel of these phage- derived 1G4 TCR  mutants was then assessed in TCR -
transfected T cells. Key mutant sTCR chains were then expressed and refolded in combination 
with wild type chains. They were then purified and analyzed for binding to HLA -A*0201-
SLLMWITQC  antigen by [CONTACT_145129] (Robbins et al., 2008). From these data TCRs anticipated to 
have good cellular properties were selected for comparison in lentiviral T cell transduction studies (Table 2.6.2(2)). 
 
    
    
 
   The clones wt, c259 and c12/c2 were then introduced into the transfer plasmid pELNS for 
lentivirus-based expression in human T cells for further testing.

[IP_ADDRESS] NYESO-1c259 TCR 
 
Measurement of cytokine secretion by [CONTACT_34536] . IFNγ secretion or granzyme B release by 
[CONTACT_93247] T cells at the single cell level in response to HLA/antigen  was detected by [CONTACT_145130] (BD Biosciences), according to the manufacturers’ instructions. Briefly, TCR -transduced 
T cells (5,000 per well) were incubated with target cells (50,000 per well) in 96- well capture 
anti-cytokine antibody pre -coated ELISpot plates. The ELISpot plate was then incubated 
overnight at 37oC/5% CO 2, followed by [CONTACT_145131] 2 hours with biotinylated 
anti-cytokine detection antibody and 1 hour with streptavidin- substrate and subsequent 
development. As controls and for specificity testing, redirected T cells were also stimulated 
with normal cell lines that lack expression of NYESO -1 antigen. Figure [IP_ADDRESS] demonstrates  
that IFNγ response was consistently higher for the high affinity c259 TCR transduced T cells 
than for the wt TCR transduced T cells. The c259- and c12c2- transduced T cells secrete IFNу 
in response to NYESO -[ADDRESS_166015] the 
melanocytes cell line N9. A greater response to the primary melanocytes was obser ved with 
c12c2 than with c259 suggesting off- target activity.  Table 2.6.2(2): Binding kinetics of 1G4 sTCRs

NY-ESO c259-transduced T cells exhibit enhanced functional responses to tumor cell 
lines but not normal cells . A summary of functional testing  of NYESO1 TCR redirected T 
cells as determined by [CONTACT_145132]-ESO expression by [CONTACT_937] -PCR in target tumor and normal cell lines  is presented 
in Tables [IP_ADDRESS](1) and Table [IP_ADDRESS](2) .  
 Table2.6.2.2(1) underscores the superiority of  c12c2- and c259-transduced T cells showing 
greater levels of response than WT transduced T cells in collective assays . These 
representations of response levels correspond to the general ELISpot counts as tabulate d  as a 
reference in the earlier Table [IP_ADDRESS](2).  Interestingly, c12c2 occasionally showed a reduced 
level of response to some target tumor cell lines compared to c259- transduced T cells. 
Reactivity of these redirected T cell against normal cell lines ( Table2.6.2.2(2) )shows that WT 
and c259-transduced T cells do not respond to a variety of normal cells, with only minor, if

The effectiveness of NYESO -1 TCR transduced T cells was tested in the immunodeficient NSG 
(NOD/scid/γcnull) mouse model using the human B -cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia 
cell line (NALM -6). The immunodeficient NOD/ scid/γcnull(NOG) mouse is an excellent 
xenotransplantation model to measure the in vivo  repopulation of human CD4 T cells  (Ito et al,. 
2009). Following engraftment, the human hematopoietic cells can be maintained in NSG mice 
for at least [ADDRESS_166016]- disease (xGVHD). Injection 
(i.v.) of NALM -[ADDRESS_166017] 
animal death within 20 -23 days. Parental NALM -6 cells express both HLA -A1 and HLA -A2 
molecules and also  low levels of MAGE A3 antigen, but no NYESO -1 antigen.  For a higher 
expression of this  antigen, we transduced NALM -6 cells with lentiviruses expressing   NYESO-
1 proteins in conjunction with the GFP protein (NALM6 -GFP-MAGE A3 and NALM6 -GFP-
NYESO1). As a control cell line, we transduced NALM -6 cells with GFP only (NALM6 -GFP). 
In a previous experiment we tested these three lines (NALM6 -GFP-MAGE A3, NALM6 -GFP-
NYESO1 and NALM6 -GFP) in the NSG mouse model and found that similarly to the parental 
NALM-[ADDRESS_166018] of 
CD4 and CD8 T cells, lentivirally transfected to express   NYESO-1 TCR on animal survival. 
The cohorts are detailed in  the Table [IP_ADDRESS]. NSG mice were engrafted with 2 x 10
6 NALM-6 
tumor alone, or expressing NYESO -1   antigens, via tail vein injection on day 0. On day 6, T 
cells were normalized for equivalent transduction percentages using untransduced cells and 5 x 10
6 transduced/control T cells were injected into animals via tail vein injection.  Animals were 
followed weekly. The primary efficacy endpoint of the study was survival.    The infused study drug cell number is [ADDRESS_166019].  A human is on average 3000- fold larger than an average mouse.  
Our maximum cell infusion dose in humans is anticipated to be  1 billion cells. 5 x 106cells in a 
mouse corresponds to a human dose of >10 billion cells (5,000,000 x 3000).  Therefore, the dose evaluated in this experiment represents about 10 times greater than the maximum human dose that will be administered in Phas e I trials.

As expected, all the control mice (injected with saline and mock/untransduced T cells) died between day 19 and 23. Also, the high affinity NYESO1 TCR (c259) transduced T cells did not give the mice any survival advantage when mice were car rying the NALM6 tumor cells. 
However when mice given the NALM6/NYESO1 tumor were treated with NYESO1 TCR transduced T cells, a significant survival advantage was seen regardless of the TCR affinity (wt or c259) (Figure [IP_ADDRESS](1) ). This data suggests that both NYESO -[ADDRESS_166024] targets expressing low antigen levels.  
 
 
2.7 Evaluation of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV, Prevnar -13®) responses

2.8 Revlimid® (Lenalidomide) as Maintenance   
 
Lenalidomide is an immunomodulatory agent which is derived from thalidomide.       
Lenalidomide with or without dexamethasone has potent activity against  myeloma which has 
relapsed after prior therapy (Weber et. al, 2007; Richardson et. al., 2009).  Recently, lenalidomide has also been used as a highly effective frontline treatment and in the maintenance setting.   Unpublished data in a phase III multicenter, randomized, double -blind 
study conducted by [CONTACT_145134] (#100104), has shown that Lenalidomide decreased the risk of disease progression by 58% vs placebo when Lenalidomide was given as maintenance after autotransplantation.  Thus we plan to use lenalidomide maintenance at a dose of 10 mg per day, starting at day +[ADDRESS_166026] of care.

3 STUDY DESIGN ( See Protocol Flow Diagram in Appendix B ) 
 
3.1 Overall Design  
 
This study will be a Phase I /II study of auto- transplantation for patients with myeloma followed by 
[CONTACT_145135] T cells which have been genetically modified to target tumor antigen. 
Approximately twenty six (26) subjects will be enrolled from two institutions, the University of Maryland and the University of Pennsylvania. Before  enrollment, patients will be tested for HLA 
A status and for tumor expression of   NY -ESO-1.  Patients who are HLA -A2+ (and express NY -
ESO-1 in the myeloma cells) will be eligible for enrollment.  The outline of the protocol is as 
follows. First patients will receive an immunization using the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine 
(Prevnar-13 ®).  About [ADDRESS_166028] been collected, patients  will then undergo hematopoietic stem cell mobilization  using 
cyclophosphamide and G -CSF (unless they have stem cells stored from a previous collection) . For 
transplant, all patients will receive high -dose melphalan followed by [CONTACT_145136] 0.  On day +2, patients with receive up to 1 x 10

T cells which have been genetically modified to express high affinity   NYESO- [ADDRESS_166029] has completed the Day +[ADDRESS_166030] of care, until disease progression.  Shortly after the 3 month staging (day [ADDRESS_166031] infusion), patients will start lenalidomide maintenance therapy.   
 After their disease prog ression, in accordance with FDA Guidelines, all patients will enter long 
term follow up (LTFU) and will continue to be monitored biannually  for delayed gene therapy 
adverse events  and collection of samples for  persistence, and annually for  collection of samples 
for RCL.     From year [ADDRESS_166032] infusion of genetically modified T cells. Patients who se disease progresses prior 
to year 1 will enter LTFU at time of progression; however  these patients  will be seen quarterly from 
progression until year [ADDRESS_166033] bioactivity, and establish proof of concept and mechanism for the function of gene modified cells in vivo by [CONTACT_56620]:  Selective migration and engraftment of gene -modified infused cells to the marrow.

3. To evaluate post -transplant cellular and antibody pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) 
responses following adoptive transfer of up to 1 x 10

gene-transduced autologous Tcells.  
4. To evaluate the clinical response in the NYESO cohort as specified in Rajkumar et al. on behalf of IMWG in 2011 [Rajkumar, 2011] by [CONTACT_35755]: 
a. objective response rate (ORR) at day 42, 100, 180, [ADDRESS_166035] objective response (BOR) prior to initiating lenalidomide and at day 360. 
c. duration of response (DOR) and progression -free survival (PFS).  
d. overall survival (OS) will be followe d in this interventional protocol and continue 
to be followed in the long- term follow-up protocol, once subjects have transferred. 
Initiation of lenalidomide as maintenance treatment will be addressed in a sensitivity analysis. 
 
3.2 Study Duration  
 
Based on previous experience, it is anticipated that approximately 1 patient per month will be enrolled on the study.   Therefore, it will take approximately twenty six (26) months to recruit all [ADDRESS_166036] 6 months of participation, but then the visit frequency lengthens out to about every 3 months until year 1, unless a problem develops which requires closer monitoring.  Patients will remain on study as long as they show no progression or relapse of myeloma or develop a complication which mandates that 
 
Protocol  [ZIP_CODE] 
Version 12.0   Page 35 of 118 
 
they discontinue study treatment.   The criteria for progression of myeloma will be as defined under Section 7.1.  Patients whose disease has progressed/relapsed will enter the Long -Term Follow-up 
Phase of the study (LTFU). Patients will also be followed for survival until death from any cause or loss to follow up.  Once the Long -Term Follow-up protocol ADP -0000-002 will be available at 
site, patients in LTFU will be considered having completed study ADP -[ZIP_CODE] and be consented to 
the LTFU protocol ADP -0000-002. 
Patients who remain disease- free at the time of study completion  (timing at Sponsor’s discretion)  
will also be consented  to the LTFU protocol  ADP-0000-002. 
3.[ADDRESS_166037] clinical care.  
 Bulk subset analysis (CD3/CD8+, CD3/CD4+, CD3+/CD4+/CD25+/CD127- , CD3-/CD16+, CD3-
/CD19+, CD3- /CD14+ will be determined fresh on each sample using lyse -no-wash protocols. 
 Persistence and homing of infused cells will be evaluated using quantitative PCR (Q -PCR) on 
marrow and peripheral blood sample s obtained pre -transplant and at multiple time -points post- 
infusion using transgene -specific primers.  If persistence levels allow, persistence will be 
corroborated by [CONTACT_1603] -based analysis using Vb specific antibodies that correspond to the infused-
cell clonotypes     
 Ex-vivo functionality of infused and persisting cells (a) and development of an expanded immune 
response against tumor (b) will be assessed on marrow samples and peripheral blood samples obtained pre-and post-T cell infusion and post lenalidomide using flow -cytometry- based immune 
effector assays, specifically degranulation, proliferation, and intracellular cytokine secretion of gene-modified (a) and bulk (b) cells in response to autologous tumor. 
 A decrease in target antigen expression in the marrow as a consequence of treatment (through immune-mediated tumor destruction or antigen- loss variant selection) will be evaluated on marrow 
samples obtained pre -and post-T cell infusion and post lenalidomide using Q -RT-PCR and 
primer/probe sets specif ic for NY-ESO-1. 
 The effect of lenalid omide administration on infused cell persistence and functionality will be 
assessed in marrow and peripheral blood samples collected just prior to and post initiation of lenalidomide administration as described above.

Standard supportive therapy may be maintained for subjects withdrawn from active treatment. Every effort will be made to collect toxicity information on withdrawn patients.  
 
 
5 TREATMENT PLAN  
 
*No study procedures may be performed prior to the patient signing informed consent.    In addition, since the study is complex, simplified protocol flow diagrams should be used along with the consent document to enable the prospective study patient to fully understand the procedures and multiple steps that are involved in the study.   
 
In order to enroll, patients must have the following HLA/tumor antigen combinations:  
 1)  HLA-A201+ and NY-ESO-1 and/or LAGE  positive myeloma  
 To establish tumor antigen expression, the following procedures will be followed: 
 
Protocol  [ZIP_CODE] 
Version 12.0   Page 40 of 118 
 
 
a)  If the patient has measureable disease, fresh marrow will be collected and tested for tumor antigen expression by [CONTACT_937]- PCR (in lab of [CONTACT_145203] at UPENN).  
 b)  If the patient has insufficient myelom a cells in the marrow (due to prior therapy) then the 
diagnostic marrow or tissue sample will be retrieved for antigen expression analysis by [CONTACT_4658] (immunohistochemistry).  
 c)  If no prior tumor samples are available and a current marrow specimen is inadequate, then the patient will not be eligible since cognate tumor antigen expression cannot be proven.

 Complete medical history, physical examination, perfo rmance status  
 CBC with differential  
 Comprehensive metabolic panel  
 Chest XRAY (Chest CT if clinically indicated)  
 Myeloma markers (SPEP + immunofixation; quantitative IgG, IgM, IgA; UPEP + 
immunofixation based on a 24 hour urine collection; serum free κ and λ light chain 
levels and κ/λ ratio determination; Beta -2 microglobulin, CRP) 
 Skeletal survey; MRI or PET scan if clinically indicated  
 Serology for hepatitis B and C; HIV; HTLV1/2; CMV  
 Pregnancy test if applicable  
 CD3,CD4 and CD8 T- cell levels 
 Staging marro w aspi[INVESTIGATOR_22602] (if not done within previous 2 months) 
 HLA A/B/DR determination (low resolution is acceptable): in most cases this will

or bortezomib/dexamethasone or equivalent). Upon completion of initial therapy  and in accordance 
with the eligibility criteria in section 4.0 , patients may enroll as described in 5.1.  
 
5.3 PCV (Prevnar -13) Immunization  (day -40 [+/-4]) 
 
Patients will also receive a n intramuscular (IM) injection of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine 
(PCV, Prevnar-13) [0.5 ml] into the non-dominant deltoid.  
 
 
Protocol  [ZIP_CODE] 
Version 12.0   Page 41 of 118 
 
5.4 Steady- State T-cell Harvesting  (day -30 [+/-10]) 
  
After enrollment, patients will undergo a mononuclear cell apheresis procedure to collect steady -
state T-cells.  If a patient has previously undergone an apheresis for T cell collection, the frozen 
product may be used if, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_145065].  The collection goal will be  about 1 x 10
8 
mononuclear cells/kg body weight. The minimum collection will be set a 0.5 x 108 mononuclear 
cells/kg. However, if the minimum collection is not reached, then a second apheresis procedure can be performed.  The cells will be transferred by [CONTACT_145142]. 
 
5.5 Stem Cell Mobilization  (Cyclophosphamide +/- Bortezomib) (day -26 [+/- 3]) 
 
After completion of the mononuclear cell apheresis procedure, patients will be offered low -dose 
cyclophosphamide chemotherapy for stem cell mobilization  at a dose of 1500-3000mg/m2 daily .  
At the discretion of the treating physician and particularly for patients with higher myeloma burdens at the time of stem cell mobilization, bortezomib may be added at a dose of 1.3 mg/m2 on days 1, 4 and 8 (3 doses).  Use of bortezomib is recommended 
for patients with ≥20% marrow 
plasmacytosis at study enrollment, prior to stem cell mobilization, to decrease tumor burden before 
stem cell collection. Addition of bortezomib to mobilization chemotherapy does not adversely 
affect stem cell yield or engraftment (Oakervee et al., 2007; Badros et al., 2006).    Patients should receive antibiotic prophylaxis upon completion of chemotherapy ( e.g. 
moxifloxacin , acyclovir, mycelex troches or equivalent) and G -CSF daily, SQ, at a dose of 10 
mcg/kg body weight (rounded to nearest multiple of 300 mcg and 480 mcg vials)  starting on the 
day after completion of chemotherapy. An acceptable alternative mobilization regimen would be plerixafor with G -CSF.   
 The goal for stem cell collection will be ~8 -10 x 10
6 CD34+ progenitors/ kg body weight with a 
minimum of 3 x 106/kg body weight needed to proceed with the transplant.  An additional  stem 
cell mobilization using another mobilization regimen  could be performed at the discretion of the 
treating physician in order to reach the stem cell collection target.   
 
Subject may receive treatment for myeloma prior to high dose therapy if there is a delay in stem cell transplant dat e due to scheduling, manufacturing delays, etc. Note, stem cell mobilization step 
may be skipped if the subject has stem cells already stored.  
 
5.6 High-dose Therapy (day -2) 
 
High-dose therapy will consist of melphalan at a dose of 200 mg/m2 given IV over about 20 
minutes on approximately  day -2.  For patients who are >70 years of age, the dose of melphalan 
will be reduced to 140 mg/m2. All patients will receive standard anti- emetic prophylaxis and 
standard antibiotic prophylaxis.  Stem cell infusion will take place on day 0, at least 18 hours after 
 
Protocol  [ZIP_CODE] 
Version 12.0   Page 42 of 118 
 
the administration of the high -dose melphalan. Stem cells will be infused intravenously over about 
20-60 minutes following premedication with acetaminophen (650 mg) and diphenhydramine (25 mg) with or without 1 mg/kg of hydrocortisone, depending on institutional preference.   G- CSF 
should be administered SQ beginning on day +5 at a dose of 480 mcg/day (or 300 mcg/day if body weight is < 60 kg). Other supportive care measures such as transfusional support will be done in accordance with standard institutional guidelines.  At least 2 x 10
6 CD34 + progenitors/kg 
body weight should be infused after high- dose therapy.  In addition, at least 1 x 106 CD34 + 
progenitors/kg body weight should be available as a backup stem cell product to be infused in the event of delayed engraftment or late graft failure.  
 
5.7 Autologous T-cell Expansion and Infusion (day +2) 
 
5.7.1 Mononuclear Cell Transfer  and transport to the manufacturing facility 
 
The manufacturing facility  will prepare the expanded T cells for patients enrolled at both sites. 
The pre-expansion mononuclear cells will be transferred by [CONTACT_24537] (same day delivery) 
in accordance with FDA -approved guidelines to the manufacturing facility .  Cell products will be 
packed and shipped according to (International Air Transport Association) IATA regulations , in 
specially designed Saf -T-Pak insulated shippers. For patients enrolled at each site, the cells will 
be washed and cryo preserved until approximately [ADDRESS_166051] Operating Procedures that are written to comply with Good Manufacturing Practices.  The flow diagra m below outlines the manufacturing steps that will be followed:

5.7.2 Apheresis Wash:  
 The apheresis product is first washed before further processing in order to remove plasma or cell suspension solution, and reduce platelets and red blood cell contamination in the apheresis product using the Baxter CytoMate Cell Washer with X -VIVO 15 based media. 
Alternatively, cells may be washed on the COBE 2991 Blood Cell Processor. 
 
5.7.3 Monocyte Depletion: 
 Monocytes present in mononuclear cells collected during the apheresis may inhibit lymphocyte proliferation. Therefore, monocytes will depleted via adherence to Dynal M-450 Epoxy beads or by [CONTACT_145143] (Gambro Elutra
TM Cell 
Separation System).  The bead adherence method can be performed  on fresh or 
cryopreserved apheresis products, and is usually done on cell suspensions with ≥20% monocyte content. About 2-4 beads per monocyte are  added to the cell suspension to be 
processed, followed by [CONTACT_145144].  The beads are then removed by [CONTACT_145145], and the numbers of recovered (monocyte -
depleted) cells are determined. An entire leukaphereis product can be monocyte depleted  
in 1-[ADDRESS_166052] trial (Rapoport et al.,2005) , the cells were cultured using Dynal microbeads 
coated with anti -CD3 (OKT3)/anti -CD28 (9.3) monoclonal antibodies and were 
manufactured at UPenn under IND #6675. Since then, we have evaluated commercially available clinical grade microbeads produced by [CONTACT_145146] -
CD3/CD28, but with different hybridoma clones. T hese Dynal microbeads are 
functionally equivalent to the beads produced at UPenn. We anticipate using beads manufactured at UPenn or  the commercial beads produced by [CONTACT_145147] 
T cells for this study.  
The culture process in the phase I trial was done using Baxt er Lifecell® flasks (Hami et 
al.,2005). We are currently culturing cells in the first 3- 5 days in a Baxter Lifecell ® or 
equivalent gas permeable bag such as the Origen PermaLife™ .  Once cells are in log phase 
expansion, they are seeded into the WAVE® bioreactor system, which has been adapted 
for T cell expansion  cultures by [CONTACT_145148][INVESTIGATOR_014] (Levine et al., 1998; Rapoport et 
al.,2009) and subsequently validated by [CONTACT_145149]. Because this system is more efficient 
in terms of cell yield and media requirements, we have switch ed from Lifecell® flasks to 
the WAVE bioreactor process. Cells will be grown in X -VIVO
TM media supplemented 
with 5% commercial pooled human AB serum. The  microbeads will be washed and added 
at a 3:[ADDRESS_166053] 
bioreactor cell culture are shown in the above figure.   Briefly, enriched lymphocytes (via elutriation) are stimulated with Dynabeads conjugated with mouse anti- human CD3 and 
CD28 in static tissue culture flasks at an approximate range of 5 x 10
8-1 x 109 cells in a 
supplemented XVIVO-15 media (Modified X -VIVO 15 Media). Beads are added at a 3:1 
bead to cell ratio.  This optimal bead: cell ratio was previously determined (IND#6675 and Levine et al., 1997). Transduction is performed on day 1 of culture with a predetermined MOIby [CONTACT_145150].

The manufacturing facility ensures that all operations and clinical trials conducted comply with  GLP, GMP, and GCP.  
 
5.7.7 Infusion of Autologous T- cells 
 The cryopreserved costimulated (“activated”) T -cells will be thawed at the bedside using 
standard procedures and infused over about 20 minutes without a leukocyte filter  on about 
day +2 of transplant.  As mentioned above, the cells will be re -suspended in 100- 500 ml 
of Plasma-lyte A or other appropriate infusion solution containing 0.5% -1% human serum 
albumin.  Patients should be pre -medicated with acetaminophen and diphenhydramine 
(benadryl).  Corticosteroids will be available at the bedside in the event of an aller gic-type 
reaction but should not be administered on a routine basis. The target dose of total T -
cells infused after gene transfer and expansion will be >0.1- [ADDRESS_166056] study (Rapoport et al., 2005) and proved to very safe and did not appear to induce any cases of clinically significant autologous GVHD.  A minimum of 0.[ADDRESS_166057] demonstrated biological activity at 
doses below 0.1 x 109, lower doses of T -cells will generally be permitted after assent of 
the PI, DSMC and Sponsor but this “low -dose” cohort will be analyzed separately for 
safety and immunoreactivity.  Patients will be monitored  for infusion related AE, which is facilitated by [CONTACT_145151]. Blood samples will be taken for cytokine monitoring prior to infusion, and at 1, 2, 4, 8, and [ADDRESS_166058] infusion, and then at each visit thereafter as described in the table of study procedures.  Cytokine monitoring will be batched and done 
retrospectively and at a minimum IFNγ, GM -CSF, and IL- 6 will be evaluated.  If toxicity 
is observed following infusion, review of the cytokine levels will be undertaken to assess risk to subsequent patients.  Cytokine levels will also be evaluated retrospectively for 
correlation with antitumor effects.  It is acknowledged that the high dose chemotherapy and stem cell infusion may contribute to changes in cytokine levels. 
Cytokine release syndrome  
Cytokine release syndrome is caused by a release of inflammatory cytokines such as IL2, IFN-γ, and TNF typi[INVESTIGATOR_145068], tumor cells and T cells.  This type of reaction 
is common in cancer immunotherapy where antibodies bind T cells that release large amounts of cytokines, or cause rapid destruction of tumor/target cells.  This causes a 
systemic inflammatory response similar to sepsis and includes fever, nausea, chills, rash 
 
Protocol  [ADDRESS_166059] (on neighboring, nontarg eted cells). The potential of NYESO -1
c259-T to 
cause cytokine release syndrome is unknown but is thought to be low because 1) the NYESO-1
c259-T has been tested in a trial at the NCI has not caused CRS in patients with 
melanoma or sarcoma and 2) cytokine re lease syndrome has not occurred in any TCR trial 
to date.    
Premedication with anti- histamine, acetaminophen can help prevent cytokine release 
syndrome. Antihistamines and acetaminophen can be administered prior to infusion, while steroids cannot be administered because they are cytotoxic or inhibitory for the study drug. If a severe cytokine release syndrome develops, the patient will be administered a one-time dose of Decadron 20- 40 mg IV to prevent further cytokine activation and release, 
anti-histamines, and supportive care (fluids, pressors, intubation if needed). Management 
of the cytokine release syndrome is described on below . 
Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) . CRS is managed in the same fashion as septic shock 
following infection with gram negative bacteria, with the exception that antibiotics are not required. Capi[INVESTIGATOR_145069].  The syndrome can be associated with pulmonary infiltrates, pulmonary 
edema, arrhythmias and cardiac arrest.   The syndrome is also associated with an elevation 
in LFTs, d- dimers, LDH, CR, uric acid, and phosphorous from immune -mediated 
cytolysis of targeted cells, with release of intracellular contents as well as a possible by[CONTACT_145152] (on neig hboring, nontargeted cells). Prophylactic measures to prevent 
CRS include correction of overhydration/volume overload before infusion with diuresis if necessary and pre- medication. Patients are pre- medicated with acetaminophen and an 
antihistamine before C IR infusion.  
As a routine, after infusion the vital signs (including pulse oximetry)  will be monitored 
every [ADDRESS_166060] benefit for CRS (Das et al, 2005). Corticosteroids have been reported 
 
Protocol  [ZIP_CODE] 
Version 12.0   Page 48 of 118 
 
to block systemic effects of T cell toxicity (Lamers et al, 2006). See Wang et al, 2008 and Stebbings et al, 2009 for e xperimental management of CRS.   
5.8 PCV (Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine, Prevnar -13®) Boosters 
 
At days 14, [ADDRESS_166061] -transplant, patients will also receive booster intramuscular (IM) 
injections of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV, Prevnar -13) [0.5 ml] into the non-
dominant deltoid.  
 
5.[ADDRESS_166062] decade, it is now generally accepted that the incorporation of lymphodepletion prior to adoptive T cell therapy enhances immune reconstitution by [CONTACT_145153], and increases tumor specific responses.  Immune reconstitution is enhanced through homeostatic proliferation of T cells which is different from antigen driven T cell expansion in that it occurs in the absence of costimulation (Ernst, Lee et al. 1999; Prlic, Blazar et al. 2001).  Homeostatic proliferation is promoted by  [CONTACT_145154] γ -chain cytokines IL -7, IL-15, and IL-21 (Wrzesinski and Restifo 2005; Rapoport, 
Stadtmauer et al. 2009; Wallen, Thompson et al. 2009), and also by [CONTACT_145155] -peptide interactions 
against self or tumor antigens (Ernst, Lee et al. 1 999; Wrzesinski and Restifo 2005) .  
Lymphodepl etion also enhances the activity of the adoptively transferred cells via the removal of 
inhibitory factors and activation of antigen presenting cells.    Since patients receiving a second infusion will most lik ely not be undergoing another ASCT, an 
alternate conditioning regimen will be used comprised of Cytoxan 1.5 gm/m2 (+/ - bortezomib x 
[ADDRESS_166063] dose should be given ~ 72 hours before the Cytoxan and the second dose can be given on the same day as the Cytoxan).  The engineered T cells will be administered as previously described in this protocol, on day [ADDRESS_166064] a white blood count (WBC) of ≤ 0.5(500 cells/mcl) within 24 hours prior to the planned T cell infusion.  This can be an outpatient procedure.  
 
 
Protocol  [ZIP_CODE] 
Version 12.0   Page 49 of 118 
 
If there was no serious toxicity attributed to the initial infusion, the second infusion may be increased up to 5 x 10e10 total cells (5- fold higher than the first infusion dose target).  The second 
infusion must be a minimum of [ADDRESS_166065] continue to meet the eligibility requirements for this study in order to remain eligible to receive a second infusion, with the exception that 1) blood counts lower than that described in the inclusion criterion are acceptable if they are believed by [CONTACT_145156], and 2) a performance status of up to an ECOG=[ADDRESS_166066].   Documentation of laboratory tests performed within the 60 days of the planned 
second T cell infusion may be used to confirm eligibility  of other eligibility criteria.  
 In cases where a second infusion is given, lenalidomide (see next section) will be held until day [ADDRESS_166067] second infusion, the Cytoxan administration will be day 0, and the T cell 
infusion will be day 2.  The patient will be followed in accordance with the schedule of procedures provided in Section 14 as shown.  Long term follow -up will be calculated from the second infusion 
date. 
5.10 Maintenance Therapy (Lenalidomid e) 
 
At about day [ADDRESS_166068] -transplant immunological assessments  
and myeloma restaging studies , patients will be eligible to   receive low -dose lenalidomide for 
maintenance therapy (10 mg/day ) until progression of myeloma or development of intolerance.  
This dose level and schedule is identical to the one that was used in a recently completed cooperative group randomized study of post -transplant maintenance therapy with lenalidomide 
which was conducted by [CONTACT_145134] (CALGB Protocol # 100104).  Because of the increased risk of thrombo- embolic events, patients will also receive low -dose aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] (81 mg/day or 325 
mg/day).  Preparations for lenalidomide maintenance therapy should be made at least [ADDRESS_166069] adequate bone marrow function defined as:  PLT > 50,000/mcl and ANC (absolute neutrophil count) > 1000).  If patients develop 
excessive myelosuppression with the dose of 10 mg daily (PLT < 25,000/mcl or ANC < 500/mcl), 
then the schedule should be adjusted to 21 days of treatment per month (dose reduction #1) or 14 days of treatment per month (dose reduction #2) once the blood counts rebound to the levels of PLT > 50,000/mcl and ANC (absolute neutrophil count) > 1000.  If patients develop excessive 
myelosuppression with the dose of 10 mg for 14 days per month (PLT < 25,000/mcl or ANC < 
500/mcl), then the dose level should be decreased to 5 mg daily for 21 days per month (dose reduction #3) and 5 mg daily for 14 days per month (dose reduction #4) (See table below).

Patients can be re- escalated by 1 dose level after 3 months of Lenalidomide if ANC > 1000 and 
platelets are >75,000.  See following tables for dose modifications.  Guidelines for Le nalidomide 
dose modification and interruptions are provided below and in Appendix I.

 If available, a patient may receive stem cells and gene- modified T cells from an identical twin sibling.  
This is a rare ev ent, and is not expected to occur more than once or twice on this protocol.  
 In the event that an identical donor sibling is identified, the following things must occur: a) Submission to UPenn regulatory committees (for UPenn subjects only): 
i) For UPenn subjects an exception request must be submitted to the UPenn regulatory committees for review and approval prior to consenting the subjects (twin donor and donor recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]) 
b) Submission to the FDA regarding the following aspects of donor identity and screeni ng: 
i) Confirmation that donor screening must adhere to the requirements outlined in 21 CFR 1271 
ii) A twin donor test must be performed by [CONTACT_145157][INVESTIGATOR_145070]; this information m ust be submitted to the 
FDA by [CONTACT_145158] 
c) Consent i) Unique consent forms for patient screening and for the patient and donor participation on the study have been developed.  These consent forms outline the study procedures that are specific to an SSCT, which are slightly different than for an ASCT due to the donor undergoing certain 
procedures. 
d) Modification in study procedures i) SSCT requires that the sibling donor perform the following procedures in lieu of the patient: (1) Receives initial prevnar vaccination at approximately day -40 
 
Protocol  [ZIP_CODE] 
Version 12.0   Page 51 of 118 
 
(2) Undergoes initial apheresis for T cell collection at approximately day 30  
(3) Undergoes stem cell mobilization using G -CSF +/- plerixafor/Mozobil® starting at or 
around day -26 
(4) Undergoes stem cell collection by [CONTACT_145159] -[ADDRESS_166070] due to potential contamination with residual myeloma in autologous grafts (Bashey et al, 2008) which is 
lacking in syngeneic grafts.  However, whether an improvement in response rates and survival is truly associated with SSCT over ASCT does remain an active area of investigation in the field and is  not 
firmly established.  
 Since graft-vs-host-disease (GVHD) does not usually occur after identical twin/syngeneic transplants, 
it is expected that the primary endpoint of this study which is assessment of safety, can be equally assessed using twin donor cells or autologous T cells.  Therefore, patients receiving an SSCT will be considered evaluable under primary study endpoints 
5.[ADDRESS_166071]  as soon as possible and no later than one month after the initial 
positive result was reported to the Sponsor.   A review by [CONTACT_145160]’s Safety Review Team and Safety Governance Board will take place.  If the second test is positive, 
infusions for all patients receiving cells modified with the same vector lot will be postponed.   The patient with the confirmed positive VSV -G signal will be scheduled for 
apheresis and a biological RCL performed on the apheresed product. If the biological RCL 
is positive, all infusions using NY-ESO-1
c259T in the interventional protocol(s) will be 
halted.  An action plan will be discussed with FDA and other regulatory authorities and experts as appropriate.  Additional subjec ts will not be treated with NY -ESO-[ADDRESS_166072] is negative, infusions for all patients can resume.    A replication-competent lentivirus (RCL) may be generated during the production phase 
or subsequently after introduction of vector transduced cells into the patient.  However, an RCL resulting from the production phase is highly unlikely since elements are incorporated in the design of the vector system that minimize vector recombination and generation of RCL.  Furthermore, the vector used to transduce the product undergoes 
 
Protocol  [ADDRESS_166073]'s virus, or could increase the r eplication rate or 
pathogenicity of the subject's virus.  Since the development of a strain with increased pathogenicity would pose greater risk to both the patient and their close contact(s), periodic monitoring for RCL is conducted during the course of t he trial.    
 Regulatory agencies and the gene therapy community have previously discussed measures to be taken should an RCL be confirmed in a patient. However, because the probability and characteristics of an RCL are unknown, no concrete plans have been  put in place.  
At the current time, it is agreed that the subject must be isolated and no additional subjects 
treated with NY -ESO-[ADDRESS_166074] management: 1. Intensive follow up of subject in consultation with FDA, and other regulatory 
authorities, NIH, gene therapy experts, study investigators, and HIV physicians. 
2. Provide targeted antiretroviral therapi[INVESTIGATOR_145071].  
 
5.12.2  Monitoring for and management of insertional oncogenesis  
Monitoring for insertional oncogenesis will be performed in accordance with FDA recommendation. The PBMC sample is used as the “surrogate sample” for testing for 
insertional oncogenesis.  The current FDA Guidance (Guidance for Industry, Gene Therapy Clinical Trials -
Observing Subjects for Delayed Adverse Events; November 2006) recommends that if at least 1% of the cells in the surrogate sample are positive for vector sequences by [CONTACT_145161] a sustained period of three conse cutive weeks, then cells will be analyzed for clonality (by 
[CONTACT_55545] Vβ repertoire for example). In this protocol, the cytoreductive conditioning followed by [CONTACT_145162] T cell transduced at >20% with the transgene is guaranteed to result in >1% marking in the “surrogate sample”.    
 
Therefore, clonality analysis will be performed if greater than 1% of the PBMC is expressing NYESO TCR at [ADDRESS_166075]’s PBMCs will be sent for Next- Gen Sequencing for integration site 
analysis by [CONTACT_3374].  Integration site analysis assesses clonality 
and the possibility of insertional oncogenesis.  This integration site analysis method, used in previous clinical trials [Hacein -Bey Abina 2015], uses sonic length quantitation, an 
accurate method of measuring relative clonal abundance [Berry, 2012].   Clonality is defined as follows: 1) monoclonality is 1 predominant clone at ≥5% of transduced T cells; 2) oligoclonality is defined as 2- 5 predominant clones, each at ≥5% of 
transduced T cells; and 3) polyclonality is defined as no single predominant clone of ≥5% 
of transduced T cells.  
 
Protocol  [ZIP_CODE] 
Version 12.0   Page 53 of 118 
 
If there is clonal dominance in the genetically modified T cell population (either monoclonality or oligoclonality) the persistence assessment will be repeated within 3 months on a new sample.  If the repeated analyses demonstrates: 1) persistent monoclonality, 2) other evidence of insertional oncogenesis (for example, integration of the vector in the promoter region of a known oncogene or tumor suppressor gene), or 3) clonal expansion (an increase in percent predominance of a clone), there will be a review by [CONTACT_145160]’s Safety Review Team and Safety Governance Board to develop a monitoring plan specific to the health care risk and strategies to inform appropriate subjects, investigators, FDA and other regulators of the findings.   If the integration site analysis indicates polyclonality of the genetically modified T cell population then screening for persistence continues as scheduled.  
 
A summary of all integration site analyses will be presented in the annual report to the 
FDA.  If oligo or monoclonality is observed, this data will be entered as an information amendment to the IND with best efforts made to submit this amendment within [ADDRESS_166076] normal tissue  
As described in the background section of this protocol, cancer testes (CT) antigens have restricted expression on normal tissue, and have only been found in testicular germ cells and placenta.  This protocol has been designed to incorporate birth control procedures and pregnancy monitoring in order to protect any potential toxicity during pregnancy.  Toxicity against testicular germ cells in men enrolled in this study is a theoretical risk.  This risk is mitigated in part because the testes are an immune privileged site primarily due to their immune suppressive environment (induced by [CONTACT_145163], cell based and cytokine based factors), and perhaps also in part by [CONTACT_145164] (Fijak, Bhushan and Meinhardt, 2011; Fijak and Meinhardt, 2006).  This reduces the opportunity for   NYESO-[ADDRESS_166077] that >10% of male infertility can be attributable to immunopathology, and therefore this remains a risk that is noted in the informed consent document.  A previous clinical study where T cells expressing the CT antigen specific NYESO -1
c259 
TCR (the same TCR as proposed for cohort 1 in this study) were administered to patients with melanoma or synovial sarcoma was conducted and recently published (Robbins et al, 2011). This study enrolled 11 men, who received a range of 1.6- 13 x 10
10 total cells 
transduced at >50%.  No toxicity was reported in this study, which supports the safety of our proposed study.

multifactorial.  
 
A non-mandatory guideline for treatment of patients with rash and diarrhea is as follows, 
and specifically the recommendation for treatment of diarrhea is taken from the published management guideline for diarrhea associated with Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_145072] (O’Day et al, 2011). It is recommended to take 3- 5 days to monitor and evaluate, with biopsy of skin 
and gut if indicated, and rule out infection or reaction to NYESO -1-T. If grade 1, institute 
and continue conservative and symptom management (change meds, treat infection, anti diarrheals). If no sign can’t  improvement and/or if grade 2, institute topi[INVESTIGATOR_8826]

After an extensive scientific and clinical investigation showing absence of correlation to the infused cells, and subsequent review of the data and this conclusion by [CONTACT_145165], the cohort pause was removed once: 1) the informed consents were updated to report the death to patients, 2)  additional 
cardiac enzyme monitoring was added to all trials with the Mage arm, and 3) a cardiac stress test was added as a screening procedure to capture patients with underlying heart conditions which otherwise may not be pi[INVESTIGATOR_145073].   The second 
patient treated with the Mage TCR was on this study.   This patient passed cardiac 
screening tests, and was informed that he was the first patient to be treated following a prior death, and he signed the updated informed consent document.  Data from this patient, 
including the absence of underlying heart disease, and pathologic evidence of acute rejection of the heart, indicated that the Mage TCR appeared to be targeting heart tissue.  Consequently extensive additional studies were carried out to investigate the 
specificity of the Mage TCR and we discovered that the Mage TCR recognized a protein that is expressed in heart tissue. This was not pi[INVESTIGATOR_145074], and not single cell cardiomyocytes.    As a result of these findings, which are to be submitted this week 
for publication, we have withdrawn the IND for the Mage TCR and no further patients will be treated.  The NY -ESO IND remains open, and is unaffected by [CONTACT_145166].  As a 
result of this SAE, additional cardiac monitoring has been implemented in this protocol for the first week post infusion in order to capture such events, consisting of daily troponins and EKG.  In addition, a recommend ed cardiac stress test for screening of 
patients upon enrollment was added for patients [ADDRESS_166080] Disease (GVHD) Syndrome 
Autologous Graft Versus Host Disease (GVHD) could occur after receiving a routine autologous 
stem cell transplant (ASCT). GVHD develops when the transplanted immune cells mistakenly 
attack the patient's normal cells. Subjects could develop a skin rash, develop diarrhea and 
sometimes belly pain, jaundice (yellowing of the skin and white of the eyes). In a previous study of investigational T cells infused following ASCT, 1 out of 6 subjects developed mild to moderate GVHD. In the more severe cases, some patients had as much as 1-2 liters (quarts) of watery diarrhea per day. All patients got completely  better after taking steroid medicines given IV or orally (pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382]) 
for a few weeks. No patients became seriously ill nor died from this side effect. However, it should 
be noted that GVHD is only rarely observed.   In the current study, several patients have developed 
diarrhea, nausea, and/or abdominal bloating that was worse and lasted longer than we would typi[INVESTIGATOR_145075]. Prophylactic non-systemic steroids may be used 
for these symptoms as per institutional standards. It is possible that these symptoms could be related 
to the investigational “redirected” T cells. All of these cases either improved on their own or 
appeared to respond to treatment with steroids, though sometimes several weeks to months of 
steroids were required, which can cause additional side effects, like upset stomach, stomach ulcers, fluid retention, irritability, high blood sugar levels, fat redistribution, facial flushing, increased appetite and weight gain, and insomnia.”

for sample -receipt, -processing, and storage and primary data from the research analyses 
will be collected and stored in the TCSL.   
6.4 Long term follow- up for observation of delayed adverse events for gene therapy 
 
 All subjects will be follo wed for 15 years from time of T -cell infusion for observation of delayed 
adverse events in accordance with FDA and EMA requirements for gene therapy clinical trials [FDA, 2006b; FDA, 2010; EMA, 2009].  If a subject receives a second T cell infusion, the clock 
restarts with the second infusion.  These assessments will be collected in the Interventional Phase of the study until disease progression and thereafter in the long term follow up ( LTFU) phase.  
Subjects will be rolled over to the  LTFU protocol  ADP-0000-002, when available at the site.  If the 
protocol ADP-0000-[ADDRESS_166083] recently released (November 2006) Guidance on Monitoring for Delayed Adverse Events states that for the first five years, all subjects should undergo monitoring of vector sequences every [ADDRESS_166084] may be sufficient for reporting of any adverse events and questions relating to the patient’s status.    From year 1 to yea r 5, patients will return to the clinic at biannual  interva ls for a medical history, 
physical exam, and blood tests for disease monitoring, CBC, chemistries, monitoring for persistence of vector modified cells and annually for RCL testing/archive.  The  physical exam and 
medical history (including concomitant medications and adverse events) will be conducted with careful attention to features possibly related to oncoretroviral diseases including: 1) New malignancies, 2) New incidence or exacerbation of a pr e-existing neurologic disorder, 3) New 
incidence of exacerbation of a prior rheumatologic or other autoimmune disorder, 4) New incidence of a hematologic disorder, 5) Opportunistic and/or serious infections, and 6) Unanticipated illness 
or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_145077].  
 For the next 10 years  (up to year [ADDRESS_166085] -infusion), subjects will be asked to return annually  for a 
physical exam,  collection of blood and testing for persistence  (if vector modified cells were 
detected in an y of the 3 previous assessments) , and RCL testing or archive.

7 RESPONSE DEFINITIONS AND STATISTICAL TREATMENT  
 
7.1 Clinical Myeloma Responses  
 
The following criteria will be used to evaluate myeloma response and progression.  The baseline 
for evaluation will be the myeloma parameters that are measured at screening (Day -50). 
 
Response IMWG criteria  (Rajkumar et al., Blood 2011)  
sCR CR as defined below plus normal FLC ratio and absence of clonal cells in bone

90% or to < 200 mg/24 h 
If the serum and urine M-protein are unmeasurable,c a > 50% decrease in the difference 
between involved and uninvolved FLC levels is required in place of the M-protein 
criteria 
If serum and urine M-protein are not measurable, and serum free light assay is also not 
measurable, ≥ 50% reduction in plasma ce lls is required in place of M-protein, provided 
baseline bone marrow plasma cell percentage was  ≥ 30% 
In addition to the above listed criteria, if present at baseline, a  ≥ 50% reduction in the 
size of soft tissue plasmacytomas is also required

Note: A clarification to IMWG criteria for coding CR and VGPR in patients in whom the only measurable disease is 
by [CONTACT_128758]: CR in such patients is defined as a normal FLC ratio of 0.26 –1.65 in addition to CR criteria 
listed above. VGPR in such patients is defined as a >90% decrease in the difference between involved and uninvolved 
free light chain (FLC) levels.   
a Confirmation with repeat bone marrow biopsy not needed.  
b Presence/absence of clonal cells is based upon the kappa/lambda ratio. An abnormal kappa/lambda ratio by 
[CONTACT_145170]/or immunof luorescence requires a minimum of 100 plasma cells for analysis. An 
abnormal ratio reflecting presence of an abnormal clone is kappa/lambda of > 4:1 or < 1:2.  
c All relapse categories require two consecutive assessments made at anytime before classification as relapse or 
disease progression and/or the institution of any new therapy. In the IMWG criteria, CR patients must also meet the 
criteria for progressive disease shown here to be classified as progressive disease for the purposes of calculating time 
to progression and progression -free survival. The definitions of relapse, clinical relapse and relapse from CR are not to 
be used in calculation of time to progression or progression -free survival.   
d For progressive disease, serum M -component increases of  >1 gm/dL are sufficient to define relapse if starting M -
component is >5 g/dL. 
e Relapse from CR has the 5% cut -off versus 10% for other categories of relapse.  
f For purposes of calculating time to progression and progression- free survival, CR patients should also be evaluated 
using criteria listed above for progressive disease.  
Abbreviations: CR, complete response; FLC, free light chain; M, monoclonal; MR, minimal response; PD, progressive 
disease; PR, partial response; sCR, stringent complete response; SD, stable disease; VGPR, very good partial 
response.

Version 12.0   Page 61 of 118 
 
 
a) progression-free survival (PFS) and duration of response (DOR),  
b) objective response rate (ORR) at day 42, 100, 180, 270 and 360. 
c) best objective response (BOR) prior to initiating lenalidomide and at day 360. 
d) overall survival (OS) will be followed in this interventional protocol and continue to be followed in the long- term follow-up protocol, once subjects have transferred. 
Initiation of lenalidomide as maintenance treatment will be addressed in a sensitivity a nalysis. 
 
 
 Exploratory Endpoints  
 
Exploratory endpoints will evaluat e correlates of treatment efficacy by [CONTACT_35755] (i ) the appearance 
of target antigen/MHC loss variants upon dis ease recurrence, as well as (ii) immunological parameters 
associated with pr oduct persistence, bioactivity and functionality. 
 (i). Appearance of target antigen/MHC loss variants upon disease recurrence will be evaluated by 
[CONTACT_145172], and comparing those values to the pre- treatment (diagnosis) samples.  NY -ESO-

selective migration and engraftment of gene- modified infused cells to the marrow post 
infusion, the e x-vivo immune functionality and phenotype of infused cells in marrow and 
periphery, the modulation of cytokine milieu in marrow and periphery at baseline, and post 
T cell infusion and post lenalidomide treatment as well as the development of an expanded patient immune response against tumor via epi[INVESTIGATOR_145052] 
7.3 Statistical Analyses  
7.3.1 Sample size determination  
 
Since the primary endpoint is  the occurrence of s tudy related adverse events, the sample size 
determination is based on testing the null hypothesis that the rate of study related adverse events is ≥40% against the alternative that this rate is <40%. Here a significant level of 25% is chosen 
because this study is an early stage feasibility trial meant to be tested further in future studies (Stallard et al., 2001). H ence, by [CONTACT_145174] -stage procedure by [CONTACT_52254] (Simon, 1989) with 
such a significance level and a power of 85% to reject the null when the true rate of study related 
adverse events is 10%, a  maximum of  [ADDRESS_166086] stage, 3 
patients per cohort will be entered. If 2 or more patients experience s tudy related adverse events, 
we will conclude that the treatment is not worth pursuing. Otherwise, an additional 3 patients will be entered for the second stage. If there are 3 or more patients experiencing study related adverse events for the full two stages of 6 patients, we will conclude that the treatment is not worth pursuing. If there are 2 or less patients experiencing study related adverse effects out of a total of 6 patients, the treatment will be considered worthy of further study.

If a patient is withdrawn from the study before infusion of the gene -modified T-cells then an 
additional patient may be enrolled so that, safety -permitting, up to 26 patients can be evaluated. 
Patients receiving the low dose (1-10 x 10e8) will be replaced with another patient so that a total of 26 patients will receive the target cell dose of >[ADDRESS_166087]  (not including binary or time to event endpoints) as mentioned in the Secondary 
Objectives. Some differences are between marrow and periphery at each time point and some are between pre- and post-treatment time points. Linear mixed effects model will be employed to 
estimate the trends of measurements of interest over time as appropriate. Thus a n evaluable 
sample size of 6 will provide 80% power at a significance level of 5% to detect an effect size of 
1.[ADDRESS_166088] the 
preliminary results from 6 patients will provide sufficient data to support the design of an adequately powered follow-on Phase II clinical trial. 
 For evaluation of the response rate of the extension arm in comparison to the Krishnan et al published controls, a t the time of the exten sion phase for the NYESO- 1 arm, responses of 4 
patients (out of the initial 6 patients) are pending.  Therefore, taking a conservative approach, with an additional [ADDRESS_166089] 24 patients for analysis. Based on the prior studies (Krishnan et al., 2011), the  complete response (CR) rate after autologous stem cell transplant in 
patients is estimated to be 36%. We expect that the CR rate in this trial will be 66%. Using the one-sided Chi-square test, we have 91.6% power to detect this meaningful difference at a 
significant level of 5%. With only [ADDRESS_166090] 85.8% power to detect this meaningful difference at a significant level of 5%.  
 
7.3.3 Study Populations 
Intent-to-Treat (ITT) population : all subjects w ho are enrolled in the study. 
Modified Intent -to-Treat (mITT) population : all ITT subjects who receive NY -ESO-1c259T 
cell infusion.  
The mITT population is the primary analysis population for efficacy and safety evaluations.  If the ITT and mITT populations are identical, only analyses associated to the mITT population will be reported.    A per-protocol population (PP) may be included if there are subjects in the mITT population who 
have protocol violations that are expected t o affect efficacy assessments (e.g., subjects enrolled 
who do not meet key eligibility criteria) during the trial.  Protocol violators resulting in exclusion from the per-protocol population will be identified and documented prior to database lock.

7.3.4 Statistical Methods for Efficacy Endpoints 
 
Efficacy endpoints are defined in sections 1.2 and 1.3. 
 
Binary endpoints  such as ORR, BOR will be analyzed as follows using Investigator 
assessments of responses in accordance with [Rajkumar, 2011].   Subjects with unknown or missing response will be treated as non- responders, i.e. they will 
be included in the denominator when calculating the proportion.  These endpoints will be summarized using Clopper -Pearson 95% (exact) confidence interval 
(CI). In addition, 95% confidence intervals will also be computed using the Wilson method.  
  
Time to event endpoints  are defined as:  
• Progression Free Survival  (PFS) is the interval between T- cell infusion  (Day 2) and 
the earliest date of disease progression or death due to any cause.  
• Overall Survival (OS), is the interval between T- cell infusion (Day 2) and death.    
• Duration of Response  (DOR), defined as the time from the initial date of the confirmed 
response to the date of progressive disease or death. 
  
No hypothesis testing is  planned for these secondary endpoints.  
 Time to event endpoints will be summarized and displayed graphically using Kaplan- Meier 
(K-M) methodology to estimate the median, and the 25th and 75th percentiles. Two- sided 
95% confidence intervals will be produced.     Censoring rules: The following censoring rules will be applied in the analyses. 
• For PFS, subjects who do not have a documented date of disease progression or death 
will be censored at the date of the last assessment.  
• For OS, subjects who are lost to follow-up or still alive will be censored at the date of 
last contact. 
• For DOR, subjects who are still alive and who do not have a documented disease 
progression will be censored at the date of the last assessment.   
 
The proportion of censored observat ions will be summarized.  
 
7.3.[ADDRESS_166091] deviations, and ranges, while categorical data will be summarized using frequency counts and percentages.  Graphical summaries of the data may be presented.  
All adverse events including SAEs will be listed and coded by [CONTACT_145175].  The number and percent of subjects reporting any adverse events will be tabulated by [CONTACT_6657]. Adverse events will be further classified by [CONTACT_926], relationship to treatment and seriousness in tabulation.  Tables and/or narratives of any death, or serious or significant adverse event, including early withdrawals because of adverse events, will be provided should they occur. Laboratory tes ts will be summarized using appropriate statistics.  
No hypothesis tests of these data will be done. 
7.4 Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_145078] (and/or resumed), pending discussion with Sponsor and Investigators and to allow protoc ol review with institutional IRBs, as well as the DSMC if any of the following occurs 
among patients who receive the study drug:  
• Any death deemed to be probably or definitely related to the investigational medication/cell 
product by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_15140]; 
• Any grade 4 events deemed to be probably or definitely related to the investigational 
medication/cell product by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_15140] .  Please note: this 
criterion excludes autoimmune adverse events.  For autoimmune adverse events, two (2) or 
more grade 4 adverse events judged to be probably, or definitely related to the 
investigational medication/cell product by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_145079]; 
• Two (2) or more grade 4 autoimmune events deemed to be probably, or definitely related 
to the investigational medication/cell product by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_15140]; 
Or 
• An apheresis confirmed positive biological RCL occurs and no additional lot of vector is 
available (see section on Monitoring for and Management of RCL) 
7.5 TOXICITY ASSESSMENTS  AND DATA REPORTING  
 
7.5.1 Toxicities Related to Investigational Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_145080] - 40 visit and ends at 1 year after T cells infusion.  
During long term follow -up (years 1 - 15), patients will only be monitored for delayed adverse events 
related to the gene transfer aspect of the protocol (See section on long term follow up). 
 
 
Protocol  [ZIP_CODE] 
Version 12.0   Page 65 of 118 
 
Toxicities or adverse events, which are defined as any symptom, sign, illness or experience that 
develops or worsens in severity over the course of the study, will be primarily assessed in relation to the investigational parts of this trial.  The investigational parts include i) infusions of the  gene-
modified T-cells.  These toxicities will be graded in accordance with the NIH Common Toxicity 
Criteria (CTC) (version 4.0).   A copy of the CTCAE Version 4.0 can be downloaded from the 
CTEP homepage (HTTP://CTEP.INFO.NIH. GOV).  All appropriate treatment areas should have 
access to a copy of the CTCAE Version 4.0.  All adverse clinical experiences, whether observed by [CONTACT_56313], must be recorded, with details about the duration and intensity of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], the action taken with respect to the test drug, and the patient’s outcome.  The investigator must evaluate each adverse experience for its relationship to the test agents and for its seriousness. 
 The investigator must appraise all abnor mal laboratory results for their clinical significance.  If 
any abnormal laboratory result is considered clinically significant, the investigator must provide details about the action taken with respect to the test agents  and about the patient’s outcome. 
 A pre-existing condition, defined as one that is present at the start of the study, should be recorded 
as an adverse event if the frequency, intensity, or the character of the condition worsens during the study period. Worsening of a pre -existing condition  after enrollment in the study but prior to 
the initiation of study treatment will be recorded in the medical record but not reported as an adverse event.    
Post-Study Adverse Event  
All unresolved adverse events should be followed by [CONTACT_145176], the 
subject is lost to follow -up, or the adverse event is otherwise explained. At the last scheduled visit, the 
investigator should instruct each subject to report any subsequent event(s) that the subject, or the subject’s 
personal physician, believes might reasonably be related to participation in this study. The investigator 
should notify the study sponsor of any death or adverse event occurring at any time after a subject has 
discontinued or terminated study participation that may reasonably be related to this study. The sponsor 
should also be notified if the investigator should become aware of the development of cancer or of a congenital anomaly in a subsequently conceived offspring of a subject that has participated in th is study. 
 
7.5.[ADDRESS_166092] include the patient number, age, sex, weight, severity of 
reaction (mild, moderate, severe), relationship to drug (probably related, unknown relationship, definitely not related), date and time of administration of test medications and all concomitant medications, and medical treatment provided.   The investigator is responsible for evaluating all adverse events to determine whether criteria for “serious” and as defined above are present.  T he 
investigator is responsible for reporting lenalidomide adverse events to Celgene as described 
below. 
 
 
Protocol  [ZIP_CODE] 
Version 12.0   Page 66 of 118 
 
Each toxic event will be considered for relationship to the T -cell infusions  and to the peptide 
immunization s and lenalidomide as follows: 
 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Unrelated 
 
This category applies to those adverse events which after careful medical consideration are clearly felt to be due to extraneous causes.  Operationally, this may be inferred from reversal of 
the adverse event following treatment of the putative ex traneous cause.  
 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Unlikely (must satisfy 1 and 2 and 3) 
 
This category applies to those adverse events which, after careful medical  and sponsor 
consideration, are felt unlikely to be related to the investigational agent  based on the 
following criteria:  
 
• It does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the 
investigational agent.  
• It could readily have been a result of the patient’s condition, environmental or toxic factors, or other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11532].  
• No causative mechanism for the investigational agent can be identified.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Possible (must satisfy 1,2 and 3) 
 
This category applies to those adverse events which, after careful medical and sponsor 
consideration, are felt unlikely to be related to the investigational agent, but the possibility cannot be ruled out with certainty.  An adverse event can be considered to be possibly related if: 
 
• It follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the investigational 
agent. 
• It could reasonably have been a result of the patient’s clinical condition, 
environmental or toxic factors, or other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_145081] 
• A possible causative mechanism for the investigational agent can be identified. 
 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Probable (must satisfy 1,2 and 3) 
 
This category applies to those adverse events which, after careful medical and sponsor 
consideration, are felt to be related to the investigational agent with a high degree of certainty.  Adverse event can be considered p robably related if: 
 
• It follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the investigational 
agent. 
 
Protocol  [ZIP_CODE] 
Version 12.0   Page 67 of 118 
 
• It could not be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_145177]. 
• A probable causative mechanism for the investigational agent can be identified.   
 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Definite (must satisfy 1 and 2 and 3) 
 
This category applies to those adverse events which, after careful medical and sponsor 
consideration, are felt to be related to the investigational agent.  An adverse event can be 
considered to be definitely related if:   
 
• It follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the investigational 
agent. 
• There are no confounding clinical conditions or factors which could explain the 
event.  
• A probable causative mechanism for the investigational agent can be identified.  
 
8 Safety and Adverse Events  
8.1 Definitions 
Unanticipated Problems Involving Risk to Subjects or Others  
Any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the following criteria:  
• Unexpected in nature, severity, or frequency  (i.e., not described in study -related documents such 
as the IRB-approved protocol or consent form, the investigators brochure, etc). 
• Related or pos sibly related to participation in the research  (i.e., possibly related means there is a 
reasonable possibility that the incident experience or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_9156]). 
• Suggests that the research places subjects or others at greater risk of harm  (including physical, 
psychological, economic, or social harm). 
Adverse Event  
An adverse event  (AE) is any symptom, sign, illness or experience that develops or worsens in 
severity during the course of the study. Intercurrent illnesses or injuries should be regarded as adverse events. Abnormal results of diagnostic procedures are considered to be adverse events if the abnormality: 
• results in study withdrawal.  
• is associated with a serious adverse event.  
• is associated with clinical signs or symptoms.  
• leads to additional treatment or to further diagnostic tests.  
• is considered by [CONTACT_1372].  
 
Protocol  [ZIP_CODE] 
Version 12.0   Page 68 of 118 
 
 
Suspected Adverse Reaction (21 CFR 312.32(a))  
Suspected adverse reaction  means any adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility that 
the drug caused the adverse event. For the purposes of IND safety reporting, "reasonable possibility" means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the adverse event. Suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which means any adverse event caused b y a drug. 
Unexpected Suspected Adverse Reaction  (21 CFR 312.32(a))  
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in the investigator brochure or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed; or, if an investigator brochure is not required or available, is not consistent with the risk information described in the general investigational plan or elsewhere in the current application, as amended. For example, under this definition, hepatic necrosis would be unexpected (by [CONTACT_14213]) if the investigator brochure referred only to elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis. Similarly, cerebral thromboembolism and cerebral vasculitis would be unexpected (by [CONTACT_145178]) if the 
investigator brochure listed only cerebral vascular accidents. “Unexpected,” as used in this definition, also refers to adverse events or suspected adverse reactions that are mentioned in the investigator brochure as occurring with a class of d rugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of 
the drug, but are not specifically mentioned as occurring with the particular drug under investigation. 
Serious Adverse Events  
 
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is any AE that is: 
 
 Fatal 
 Life-threatening1 
 Requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408] 
 Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity2 
 A congenital anomaly or birth defect  
 An important medical event3 
1“Life-threatening” means that the subject was at immediate risk of death at the time of the serious adverse event; it 
does not refer to a serious adverse event that hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.  
2“Persistent or significant disability or incapacity” means that there is a substantial disruption of a person’s ability 
to carry out normal life functions.  
3Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is appropriate in 
situations where none of the outcomes listed above occurred.  Important medical events that may not be 
immediately life -threatening or result in d eath or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_145082].  Examples of such events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  A new diagnosis of cancer during the course of a treatment should be 
considered as medically important. 
 
 
 
All Serious Adverse Events will be recorded and reported to the Sponsor, to IRBs, DSMCs and IBCs  
of both collaborating institutions (University of Maryland and University of Pennsylvania)   in 
 
Protocol  [ADDRESS_166093] reporting procedures.  SAEs  will be reported to the FDA and NIH OBA by 
[CONTACT_145179] . .The following table also shows the expedited 
reporting guidelines for the University of Maryland (unless otherwise specified) of AEs to the IRBs and IBCs.  If not listed then the event need not be reported in an expedited fashion (also see “Pregnancies” section and Lenalidomide next page).

Information on all adverse events should be recorded immediately in the source document, and also in the appropriate adverse event module of the case report form (CRF). All clearly related signs, symptoms, and abnormal diagnostic procedures results should recorded in the  source document, 
though should be grouped under one diagnosis. 
All adverse events occurring during the study period must be recorded (section 8.3). The clinical 
course of each event should be followed until resolution, stabilization, or until it has been determined that the study treatment or participation is not the cause. Serious adverse events that are still ongoing at the end of the study period must be followed up to determine the final outcome. Any serious adverse event that occurs after the study pe riod and is considered to be possibly related to the study treatment 
or study participation should be recorded and reported immediately. 
8.3 Adverse Event Reporting Period  and Adverse Event Reporting  
Patients will be monitored for the duration of the intervention protocol (Day - 40 visit until 
relapse/progression or until [ADDRESS_166095] ).  For patients who remain disease 
progression-free beyond Year [ADDRESS_166096] of  the protocol (see Section 6.4 for definition) until disease progression

8.3.1 Investigator Reporting: Notifying the IRB  
Investigators at each site are responsible for safety reporting to their local IRB. Investigators are responsible for complying with their local IRB’s reporting requirements, though must submit the required reports to their IRB no later than 10 working days.  Copi[INVESTIGATOR_145084]’s study file.   
Sponsor Responsibility for Reporting Adverse Events 
All adverse events will be reported by [CONTACT_145180], and investigators in 
accordance with all applicable laws and regulations.    
8.3.2 Investigator reporting: notifying the Penn IRB and IBC 
 
This section describes the requirements for safety reporting by [CONTACT_145181], affiliated with a Penn research site, or otherwise responsible for safety reporting to the Penn IRB  
and IBC. The University of Pennsylvania IRB  and IBC (Penn IRB /IBC) requires expedited 
reporting of those events related to study participation that are unforeseen and indicate that participants or others are at increased risk of harm.  The Penn IRB will not acknowledge safety reports or bulk adverse event submissions that do not meet the criteria outlined below.  The Pen n 
IRB requires researchers to submit reports of the following problems within 10 working days 
from the time the investigator becomes aware of the event:  
• Any adverse event (regardless of whether the event is serious or non- serious, on-site or 
off-site) that occurs any time during or after the research study, which in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_145085]: 
Unexpected (An event is “unexpected” when its specificity and severity are not 
accurately reflected in the protocol -related documents, such as the I RB-approved 
research protocol, any applicable investigator brochure, and the current IRB -approved 
informed consent document and other relevant sources of information, such as product labeling and package inserts.)  
AND 
Related to the research procedures (An event is “related to the research procedures” if 
in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_28692], the event was more likely than not to be caused by [CONTACT_28821].)  
 
Reporting Process  
Unanticipated problems posing risks to subjects or others as noted above will be reported to the Penn IRB using the form: “Unanticipated Problems Posing Risks to Subjects or Others Including Reportable Adverse Events” or as a written report of the event (including a description  of the event with information regarding its fulfillment of the above criteria, 
 
Protocol  [ZIP_CODE]

follow-up/resolution and need for revision to consent form and/or other study 
documentation).  Copi[INVESTIGATOR_17236]’s study file.  
Reporting Deaths:  more rapid reporting requirements  
Concerning deaths that occur during the course of a research study, the following describes the more rapid reporting requirement of the Penn IRB for specific situations:
 
• Report the event within 24 hours  when the death is unforeseen (unexpected) and 
indicates participants or others are at increased risk of harm.  
• Report the event within 72 hours, for all other deaths, regardless of whether the death 
is related to study participation.  
 
For reportable deaths, the initial submission to the Penn IRB may be made by [CONTACT_145182]. The AE/Unanticipated Problem Form is required as a follow up to the initial submission.  
 
Other Reportable events:  
For clinical drug trials, the following events are also reportable to the Penn IRB: 
- Any adverse experience that, even without detailed analysis, represents a serious 
unexpected adverse event that is rare in the absence of drug exposure (such as 
agranulocytosis, hepatic necrosis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome). 
- Any adverse event that would cause the sponsor to modify the investigators brochure, protocol or  informed consent form, or would prompt other action by [CONTACT_145183]. 
- Information that indicates a change to the risks or potential benefits of the research, 
in terms of severity or frequency. For example:  
– An interim analysis indicates that participants have a lower rate of response 
to treatment than initially expected.  
– Safety monitoring indicates that a particular side effect is more severe, or 
more frequent than initially expected.  
– A paper is published from another study that shows that an arm of your 
research study is of no therapeutic value.  
• Change in FDA sa fety labeling or withdrawal from marketing of a drug, device, or 
biologic used in a research protocol. 
• Breach of confidentiality 
• Change to the protocol taken without prior IRB review to eliminate apparent immediate hazard to a research participant.  
• Incarceration of a participant when the research was not previously approved under Subpart C and the investigator believes it is in the best interest of the subject to remain on the study. 
 
Protocol  [ZIP_CODE] 
Version 12.0   Page 72 of 118 
 
• Complaint of a participant when the complaint indicates unexpected risks or the complaint cannot be resolved by [CONTACT_5051].  
• Protocol violation (meaning an accidental or unintentional deviation from the IRB approved protocol) that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_116576], or affects the rights or welfare of subjects.  
8.3.3 Investigator reporting: notifying the Penn DSMC  
 
All events meeting the DSMC reporting requirements must be entered into the mandatory Velos AE/SAE form.  A study CRF does not replace the ACC central reporting form.   
 
Once an event is entered, please send an email alert to Doris Shank 
[EMAIL_2969] .  If your study has prospective DOCM monitoring (as determined 
by [CONTACT_145184]) you should notify your study monitor. 
 
Every effort should be made to report an a s a diagnosis, not as list of symptoms.  Symptoms that 
led to the diagnosis should be included in the event description, but should not be the actual 
event.    Do not leave any of the fields blank. 
 
Once an event is reported, you must keep the information accurate and current in Velos.  If new/updated information is learned about the event, the event should be amended or corrected promptly.  
 
Off-site (external sponsors)  
• All SAEs (on the specific protocol opened here only) defined as reportable in the protocol for Phase I and II studies must be reported to the DSMC.  • SAEs on cooperative or industry sponsored Phase III studies do not have to be reported.  • SAEs on Other Externally Peer Reviewed Phase III have to be reported if the protocol defines 
them as reportable.  
 Note: The DSMC reserves the right to modify the reporting window for certain types of studies i.e. gene therapy, adoptive therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], Penn manufactured vaccines etc.  
8.3.4 Investigator reporting: Notifying  a non-Penn IRB (See table on page 67 for UMD IRB reporting 
guidelines) 
 
Investigators who are not Penn faculty or affiliated with a Penn research site are responsible 
for safety reporting to their local IRB.  
 
8.3.5 Sponsor Reporting: Notifying the FDA  
The study sponsor is required to report certain study events in an expedited fashion to the FDA. These written notifications of adverse events are referred to as IND safety reports. The sponsor must report an IND safety reports as described in:   
 
Protocol  [ZIP_CODE] 
Version 12.0   Page 73 of 118 
 
 
http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidanc
es/UCM227351.pdf    
 The following describes the safety reporting requirements by [CONTACT_28822]:  
• Within 7 Calendar Days  
Any study event that is: 
o Unexpected fatal or life -threatening suspected adverse reaction.  Including all 
deaths and grade 4 non- hematological events irrespective of attribution 
occurring within 30 days of study drug administration. 
• Within 15 Calendar Days  
Any study event that is: 
o unexpected 
o Suspected adverse reaction that is serious, but not fatal or life- threatening 
-or- 
o a previous adv erse event that was not initially deemed  reportable but is later 
found to fit the criteria for reporting (reporting within 15 calendar days from when event was deemed reportable). 
 
Any finding from tests in laboratory animals that:  
o suggest a significant risk for human subjects including reports of mutagenicity, teratogenicity, or carcinogenicity or reports of significant organ toxicity at or near the expected human exposure. 
 
Increase in rate of occurrence of serious suspected adverse reactions:  
o any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse 
reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure.  
Additional Reporting Requirements  
Sponsor is also required to review all adverse events to make a causality determ ination on 
the basis of information from investigators and report these findings to the FDA in accordance with [ADDRESS_166098] of the study will comply with all FDA safety reporting requirements.   
 
IND Annual Reports 
If the FDA has granted an IND number, it is a requirement of 21 CFR 312.33, that an annual report is provided to the FDA within 60-days of the IND anniversary date.  21 CRF 312.33 provides the data elements  that are to be submitted in the report.  The Annual Report should 
be filed in the study's Regulatory Binder. 
 
Protocol  [ADDRESS_166099] an d any proposed changes to the protocol will be forwarded to the DSMC.  
8.5 Coordination of Patient Registration/Reporting  
 
To register a patient, the following documents should be completed by [CONTACT_145185]:  
1)  Copi[INVESTIGATOR_145086] (laboratory tests, radiology, 
PE, History, Concomitant Medications) 
    2)   Copy of signed patient consent form 
    3)   Copy of HIPAA authorization form 
    4)   Eligibility checklist 
    5)   Enrollment Form 
 The research n urse or data manager at each site will then call or email the Monitor at the Sponsor  to 
confirm eligibility.  Afterwards, the patient will be assigned a study number and will formally register on the study.   Clinical trial event scheduling and data colle ction and storage will be supported by [CONTACT_145186]. 
CRFs (case report forms) for each study event will be completed and submitted to Velos on- line or 
within time specified by [CONTACT_145187].  
 
8.6 Protocol Deviations  
 
Exception 
A one time, intentional  action or process that departs from the IRB and CTSRMC approved 
study protocol, intended for one  occurrence. If the action disrupts the study progress, such that 
the study design or outcome (endpoints) may be compromised, or the action compromises the safety and welfare of study subjects, advance  documented IRB and DSMC approval is 
required.    
For this study, there will be no exceptions to eligibility  granted for this study.

9 THERAPEUTIC AND INVESTIGATIONAL AGENTS  
 
This section will describe all the therapeutic and investigational agents to be administered to the 
patient, including dose, route of administration, and possible adverse reactions that may be observed.   
9.1 Lenalidomide: Drug information 
 
Copyright 1978- 2009 Lexi-Comp, Inc. All rights reserved.  
 PHARMACOLOGICCATEGORY  
Antiangiogenesis Agent Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) Blocking Agent.  
The mechanism of action of lenalidomide remains to be fully characterized. Lenalidomide possesses 
immunomodulatory and antiangiogenic properties.  Lenalidomide inhibited the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and increased the secretion of anti- inflammatory cytokines from peripheral 
blood mononuclear cells.  Lenalidomide inhibited cell proliferation with varying effectiveness (IC50s) in some but not all cell lines.  Of cell lines tested, lenalidomide was effective in inhibiting growth of Namalwa cells (a human B cell lymphoma cell line with a deletion of one chromosome 5) but was much less effective in inhibiting growth of KG- 1 cells (human myeloblastic cell line, also 
with a deletion of one chromosome 5) and other cell lines without chromosome 5 deletions.  Lenalidomide inhibited the expression of cyclooxygenase- 2 (COX-2) but not COX-1 in vitro.   
PHARMACOKINETICS AND DRUG METABOLISM OF LENALIDOMIDE:  
Absorption:Lenalidomide, in healthy volunteers, is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_145087] 0.[ADDRESS_166101] -dose. Co 
administration with food does not alter the extent of absorption (AUC) but does reduce the maximal plasma concentration (Cmax) by 36%. The pharmacokinetic disposition of lenal idomide is linear. 
Cmax and AUC increase proportionately with increases in dose. Multiple dosing at the recommended dose-regimen does not result in drug accumulation. 
Pharmacokinetic analyses were performed on 15 multiple myeloma patients treated in the ph ase I 
studies.  Absorption was found to be rapid on both Day 1 and Day 28 with time to maximum blood 
levels ranging from 0.7 to 2.0 hours at all dose levels (5mg, 10mg, 25mg, and 50mg).  No plasma accumulation was observed with multiple daily dosing.  Plas ma lenalidomide declined in a 
monophasic manner with elimination half-life ranging from 2.8 to 6.1 hours on both Day 1 and 28 at all 4 doses.  Peak and overall plasma concentrations were dose proportional over the dosing range of 5mg to 50mg .   Exposure (A UC) in multiple myeloma patients is 57% higher than in healthy male 
volunteers.  
Pharmacokinetic Parameters:  
Distribution:  In vitro (14C)-lenalidomide binding to plasma proteins is approximately 30%.

Version 12.0   Page 77 of 118 
 
Metabolism and Excretion:  The metabolic profile of len alidomide in humans has not been studied. 
In healthy volunteers, approximately two- thirds of lenalidomide is eliminated unchanged through 
urinary excretion. The process exceeds the glomerular filtration rate and therefore is partially or entirely active.  Half -life of elimination is approximately 3 hours. 
ADMINISTRATION  
Administer with water. Swallow capsule whole; do not break, open, or chew.  If a dose of lenalidomide is missed, it should be taken as soon as possible on the same day.  If it is missed for  the 
entire day, it should not be made up.
 
Patients who take more than the prescribed dose of lenalidomide should be instructed to seek 
emergency medical care if needed and contact [CONTACT_58131].  
SUPPLIER  
Celgene Corporation will supply Revlimid® (lenalidomide) to study participants through the 
RevAssist® program.The RevAssist program is a restricted distribution program under which lenalidomide is provided by [CONTACT_27718].  The reason for this program is to track and control the use of lenalidomide since it is a derivative of thalidomide and therefore there are serious reproductive safety 
concerns.  The purpose of the program is to ensure that patients receiving, and physicians administering, lenalidomide are aware of these concerns and take p recautions to avoid prescribing 
lenalidomide while pregnant, and to take necessary precautions to avoid pregnancy while on lenalidomide.    The program requires any prescriber of lenalidomide to be registered with the program.  Patients must also be enrolled in the program and agree to comply with the requirements of the program as described in the informed consent.  In addition, only RevAssis t contract pharmacies are able to provide 
lenalidomide.  Additional details and information packets regarding lenalidomide and the RevAssist program can be found at http://www.revlimid.com.  
 PACKAGING  
Lenalidomide will be shipped directly to patients.   Bottles will contain a sufficient number of capsules for one cycle of dosing. 
 
STORAGE  
Lenalidomide should be stored at room temperature away from direct sunlight and protected from excessive heat and cold.  
 PRESCRIBING INFORMATION  
Lenalidomide will be prov ided in accordance with the RevAssist® program of Celgene Corporation.  
Patient insurance will be charged for the lenalidomide prescription.  Per standard RevAssist® requirements all physicians who prescribe lenalidomide for research subjects enrolled into  this trial, 
and all research subjects enrolled into this trial, must be registered in and must comply with all requirements of the RevAssist® program.  Prescriptions must be filled within 7 days.  Only enough lenalidomide for one cycle of therapy will be supplied to the patient each cycle.

PREGNANCY IMPLICATIONS   
[U.S. Boxed Warning]: Lenalidomide is an analogue of thalidomide (a human teratogen) and could potentially cause birth defects in humans. Animal studies with lenalidomide are ongoing; there are no adequate and well -controlled studies in pregnant women. Women of childbearing 
potential should be treated only if they are able to comply with the conditions of the RevAssist
SM 
program. Two forms of effective contraception are required beginning 4 weeks prior to, during, and for 4 weeks after therapy and during therapy interruptions. Preg nancy tests (sensitivity of at 
least 50 mIU/mL) should be performed 10 -14 days and 24 hours prior to beginning therapy; 
weekly for the first 4 weeks and every 4 weeks (every 2 weeks if menstrual cycle irregular) thereafter and during therapy interruptions. Lenalidomide must be immediately discontinued and the patient referred to a reproductive toxicity specialist if pregnancy occurs during treatment. Males (even those vasectomized) should use a latex condom during any sexual contact [CONTACT_145188]. Risk to the fetus from semen of male patients is unknown. The parent or legal guardian for patients between [ADDRESS_166103] agree to ensure compliance with the required guidelines. Any suspected fetal exposure should be reported to the FDA via the MedWatch program (1 -800-FDA-1088) and to Celgene Corporation ([PHONE_3213])

 MECHANISM OF ACTION 
Reversibly inhibits binding of stromal cell- derived factor -1-alpha (SDF-1α), expressed on bone 
marrow stromal cells, to the CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4), resulting in mobilizationof 
hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells from the b one marrow into peripheral blood.  Plerixafor used 
in combination with Filgrastim results in syngergistic increase in CD34+ cell mobilization.  Mobilized CD34+ cells are capable of engrafting with extended repopulating capacity.    PHARMACODYNAMICS / KINET ICS

 CONTRAINDICATIONS  
Hypersensitivity to bortezomib, boron, mannitol, or any component of the formulation  WARNINGS / PRECAUTIONS  
Special handling: Hazardous agent: Use appropriate precautions for handling and disposal.  Concerns related to adverse effects:  Bone marrow suppression: Hematologic toxicity, including 
neutropenia and severe thrombocytopenia may occur; risk is increased in patient s with pretreatment 
platelet counts <75,000/µL; frequent monitoring is required throughout treatment; may require dosage adjustments; withhold treatment for platelets <25,000/µL. Hemorrhage (gastrointestinal and intracerebral) due to low platelet count has  been observed.  
  
Cardiovascular effects: May cause hypotension (including postural and orthostatic); use caution with dehydration, history of syncope, or medications associated with hypotension. Has been associated with the development or exacerbation of congestive heart failure and decreased left ventricular ejection fraction; use caution in patients with risk factors or existing heart disease. Has also been associated with QT
c prolongation.  
  
Hepatotoxicity: Acute liver failure has been reported (rarely) in patients receiving multiple concomitant medications; hepatitis, transaminase increases, and hyperbilirubinemia have also been reported. Use caution in patients with hepatic dysfunction; toxi cities may be increased.  
  
Herpes reactivation: Herpes (zoster and simplex) reactivation has been reported with bortezomib; consider antiviral prophylaxis during therapy.  
  
Peripheral neuropathy: May cause peripheral neuropathy (usually sensory but may be mixed sensorimotor); risk may be increased with previous use of neurotoxic agents or pre- existing 
peripheral neuropathy; adjustment of dose and schedule may be required.  
  
Pulmonary toxicity: Pulmonary disorders including pneumonitis, interstitial pneumonia, lung infiltrates, and acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_1505] (ARDS) have been reported. Pulmonary hypertension (without left heart failure or significant pulmonary disease) has been reported rarely.  
  
Reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS): Has been reported (rarely). Symptoms of RPLS include confusion, headache, hypertension, lethargy, seizure, blindness and/or other vision, or neurologic disturbances; discontinue if RPLS occurs. The safety of reinitiating bortezomib in patients previously experiencing RPLS is unknown.  
  
Tumor lysis syndrome: May cause tumor lysis syndrome; risk is increased in patients with high tumor burden prior to treatment

12 Appendix A: Criteria for Diagnosis of Plasma Cell Myeloma* 
 
 
Major criteria  
  Plasmacytomas on tissue biopsy  
  Marrow plasmacytosis with > 30% plasma cells  
  Monoclonal globulin spi[INVESTIGATOR_145100] > 3.5 g/dl for IgG or > 2.0 g/dl for  
  IgA; ≥ 1.0 g/24 h of κ or λ light-chain excretion on urine electrophoresis in the absence 
  of amyloidosis 
 Minor criteria  
  Marrow plasmacytosis 10-30%   Monoclonal globulin spi[INVESTIGATOR_58093], but less than the levels defined above   Lytic bone lesions   Normal IgM < 0.05 g/dl, IgA < 0.1 g/dl, or IgG < 0.6 g/dl 
 
*The diagnosis of plasma cell myeloma is confirmed when at least one major and one minor criteria or at least three minor criteria are documented in symptomatic  patients with  progressive disease.  
The presence of features not specific for the disease may support the diagnosis, particularly if of recent onset:  anemia, hypercalcemia, azotemia, bone demineralization, or hypoalbulinemia.

1.0     PROTOCOL  SUMMARY AND/OR  SCHEMA 
 
This is a single- arm, open- label,  non-randomized  multi-institution Phase  II study  of pembrolizumab in 
combination  with capecitabine/ -FU and a platinum  and trastuzumab  as first line therapy  in patients  with 
metastatic  HER2  positive  esophagogastric  (EG) adenocarcinoma.  The goal of the study  is to determine  the 
efficacy  of the drug combination as measured  by 6 month progression free survival (PFS).  The central  
hypothesis  of this trial is that dual HER2  and PD1/2  blockade  will result in enhanced  antibody -dependent  cell- 
mediated  cytotoxicity  (ADCC),  NK cell degranulation, and synergistic activity  in combination  with 
fluoropyrimidine,   and platinum. 
 
 
2.0     OBJECTIVES AND SCIENTIFIC AIMS  
 
Primary:  
 
To determine the efficacy  of pembrolizumab in combination  with trastuzumab and capecitabine/5- FU and 
oxaliplatin/cisplatin  and in patients  with Stage IV HER2 -positive  EG adenocarcinoma as measured by 6 
month progression free survival  (PFS).  
Secondary:  
 
• To establish  the safety  of pembrolizumab in combination with capecitabine/5- FU, oxaliplatin/cisplatin,  and 
trastuzumab  in patients  with metastatic  HER2 -positive  metastatic  EG adenocarcinoma. 
• To observe  other  measures  of efficacy  of pembrolizumab in combination with capecitabie/5- FU, 
oxaliplatin/cisplatin,  and trastuzumab, including response rate, overall  and 1-year survival in patients  with 
Stage  IV EG adenocarcinoma.  
 
• Determine overall  clinical benefit  defined  as stable disease (SD),  complete response  rate (CR),  or partial  
response (PR) safety  and tolerability.  They  will be summarized using binomial  proportions  along with exact  
95% CI. 
 
• Median PFS,  overall  and 1-year survival  in patients  with HER2+  Stage  IV esophageal, gastric  or GEJ 
adenocarcinoma will be estimated using the Kaplan- Meier  method  
Exploratory:  
 
• To utilize  PMBC  and cell-free tumor  DNA (cfDNA)  from blood specimens  collected during the course of 
treatment  to explore  mechanism  of primary  and acquired resistance to pembrolizumab and trastuzumab  
therapy.  
• To explore tumor  PD-L1 as predictive biomarker. 
• To bank  tumor  material  for future correlative analysis,  including  but not limited  to whole exome analysis  
to determine  mutation  load and specific  neoantigen  landscape with strong association with regimen  
efficacy  and survival.  
• To explore changes  in 89Zr-trastuzumab PET with trastuzumab  and pembrolizumab treatment.  
• To explore  response rate of pembrolizumab with trastuzumab  in patients  with HER-2  positive  metastatic  
esophagogastric  cancer

3.0     BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE 
 
3.1 HER2 -Positive  Esophagogastric  Cancer  
 
Esophagogastric  (EG) cancer  is the second most  common  cause of cancer -related death worldwide,  and 
represents  an enormous  global  health  burden.1  In 2015, an estimated  22,220 people will be diagnosed  
and 10,990 people  will eventually  die of their disease in the [LOCATION_002].2 Depending  on tumor  
characteristics  and stage,  treatment  modalities  include  combinations  of surgery,  chemotherapy,  and 
radiation  therapy.1   Even  with maximal  therapy,  prognosis  for EG cancer  remains  poor,  with 5-year survival  
rate of 5%2,[ADDRESS_250761] primary  chemotherapy  refractory  disease. For these patients  there  is a need  for 
development  of new therapeutic  options.6 
 
Human epi[INVESTIGATOR_45734]  2 (HER2;  also known as ERBB2),  a member  of a family  of receptors  
associated with tumor  cell proliferation,  apoptosis, adhesion,  migration,  and differentiation  is an established  
biomarker  and key driver  of tumorigenesis  in gastric  cancer.7 Approximately  20-30% of gastric  and GEJ 
adenocarcinomas  harbor  HER2  overexpression.7,8 
 
Trastuzumab is a humanized  monoclonal  antibody  (IgG1   isotype)  directed against the extracellular  region  
of HER2  that induces  antibody -dependent  cellular  cytotoxicity,  inhibits  HER2 -mediated signaling,  and 
prevents  cleavage of the extracellular  domain of HER2.[ADDRESS_250762] randomized,  
prospective,  multicenter,  phase III trial to evaluate the efficacy  and safety  of trastuzumab  in HER2 -positive  
EG adenocarcinoma  in combination with cisplatin and a fluoropyrimidine.7 In this study,  594 patients  were 
randomly  assigned  to study  treatment  (trastuzumab plus chemotherapy,  n=298;  chemotherapy  alone,  
n=296). The results  of this study  established  the benefit of trastuzumab  in combination with cisplatin and 
fluoropyrimidine chemotherapy.  Median overall  survival  was 13.8 months  (95% CI 12–16) in those assigned  
to trastuzumab  plus chemotherapy  compared with 11.1 months  (10–13) in those assigned to chemotherapy  
alone  (HR 0.74; 95% CI 0∙60– 0∙91; p=0∙0046).  Median progression -free survival  was 6.7 months  (95%  CI 
6–8) in the trastuzumab plus chemotherapy  group  compared to 5.5 months  (5–6) in the chemotherapy  alone  
group (HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.59– 0.85; p=0.0002).  Overall  tumor  response rate, time to progression,  and 
duration of response  were  significantly  improved in the trastuzumab  plus chemotherapy  group compared  to 
the chemotherapy  alone group.  Rates  of overall  grade  3 or 4 adverse events  (201 [68%]  vs 198 [68%])  and 
cardiac  adverse events  (17 [6%] vs 18 [6%])  did not differ  between groups.[ADDRESS_250763] option for patients  with HER2 -positive  advanced EG cancer  when  
combined with a chemotherapy  regimen  consisting of a fluoropyrimidine (5-FU or capecitabine)  and 
cisplatin.  
 
3.[ADDRESS_250764]  immune surveillance in controlling outgrowth  of neoplastic  transformation has been  
known for decades. Accumulating  evidence shows  a correlation between tumor -infiltrating  lymphocytes  
(TILs)  in cancer  tissue and favorable  prognosis  in various  malignancies.  In particular,  the presence of CD8+  
T-cells and the ratio of CD8+  effector  T-cells / FoxP3+  regulatory  T-cells seems  to correlate with improved  
prognosis  and long- term survival  in many  solid tumors. The programmed  death (PD)-[ADDRESS_250765]  hijacked  by [CONTACT_209840].   The normal  function of PD-

1, expressed  on the cell surface  of activated T-cells under  healthy  conditions,  is to down- modulate unwanted  
or excessive  immune  responses,  including autoimmune reactions.  PD-1 (encoded  by [CONTACT_13228]1)  is an 
Ig superfamily  member  related to CD28  and CTLA -4 which has been shown to negatively  regulate antigen  
receptor  signaling  upon engagement  of its ligands  (PD-L1 and/or  PD L2). The structure  of murine  PD-1 has 
been resolved.  PD-1 and family  members  are type I transmembrane  glycoproteins  containing  an Ig Variable-  
type (V-type)  domain  responsible for ligand binding  and a cytoplasmic  tail whichis responsible  for the binding  
of signaling  molecules.  The cytoplasmic  tail of PD-1 contains  2 tyrosine -based  signaling  motifs, an 
immunoreceptor  tyrosine -based  inhibition   motif  (ITIM)  and an immunoreceptor  tyrosine- based switch  motif 
(ITSM). Following T-cell stimulation,  PD [ADDRESS_250766] from that of CTLA -4 as both molecules  regulate an overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_209810]. PD- 
1 was shown to be expressed on activated lymphocytes  including  peripheral  CD4+  and CD8+  T-cells,  B- 
cells,  T regs and Natural  Killer  cells.  Expression has also been shown during thymic  development on CD4- 
CD8- (double negative)  T-cells as well as subsets of macrophages  and dendritic  cells.  The ligands  for PD-1 
(PD-L1 and PD-L2) are constitutively  expressed or can be induced in a variety  of cell types,  including non- 
hematopoietic  tissues  as well as in various  tumors. Both ligands  are type I transmembrane receptors  
containing  both IgV- and IgC-like domains  in the extracellular  region  and contain short cytoplasmic  regions  
with no known  signaling  motifs. Binding of either  PD-[ADDRESS_250767] 
notably  on vascular  endothelium,  whereas  PD-L2 protein is only detectably  expressed on antigen- presenting  
cells found in lymphoid  tissue or chronic  inflammatory  environments.  PD-L2 is thought to control  immune  T- 
cell activation in lymphoid organs,  whereas  PD-L1 serves  to dampen  unwarranted  T-cell function in 
peripheral  tissues. Although healthy  organs  express  little (if any) PD-L1, a variety  of cancers  were 
demonstrated to express  abundant levels  of this T-cell inhibitor. PD-1 has been suggested to regulate tumor - 
specific  T-cell expansion in subjects  with melanoma  (MEL). This suggests  that the PD-1/PD -L1 pathway  
plays  a critical  role in tumor  immune  evasion  and should be considered as an attractive target  for therapeutic  
intervention.  
 
Pembrolizumab  is a potent and highly  selective  humanized  monoclonal  antibody  (mAb)  of the IgG4/kappa  
isotype designed to directly  block  the interaction between  PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2. 
KeytrudaTM  (pembrolizumab)  is approved in the United Stated  for the treatment  of patients  with unresectable  
or metastatic  melanoma  and metastatic  non-small  cell lung cancer.

frequency,  up to 88% in some  types  of cancer.  In a number  
of these cancers,  including lung10, renal11, pancreatic12, and 
ovarian13, the expression  of PD-L1 is associatedwith reduced  
survival  and unfavorable  prognosis.  Several  recent studies,  
however,  suggest that high PD-L1 expression is a “positive”  
prognostic  factor  (i.e., better  prognosis)  among  metastatic  
melanoma14,15, NSCLC16,17, and gastric  cancer  patients.18 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure  2 Dramatic  and durable  response  from  PD-1 
inhibitor  in 4th line of therapy of chemotherapy  Pembrolizumab  is able to achieve  a dual blockade (PD-L1 
and PD-L2). It shows  no cytotoxic  (ADCC/CDC)  activity.  
Pharmacokinetics  support  dosing  every  2 weeks  (Q2W)  or 
every  3 weeks  (Q3W).  Pembrolizumab demonstrated  a 
clinical activity  in multiple  tumor  types.The levels  of tumor - 
infiltrating  lymphocytes  (TILs),  and more  specifically  cytotoxic  
T cells,  have been  correlated to improved prognosis  in a 
number  of cancers  including  colorectal, melanoma,  and 
lung19, suggesting  that an antitumor  immune  response is 
beneficial  to patients. It has been shown in vitro that an 
antibody   that blocks the interaction  between PD-L1 and its 
receptors  can relieve  PD-L1-dependent  immunosuppressive effects  and 
enhance the cytotoxic  activity of antitumor  T cells.[ADDRESS_250769]  PD -L1, or its receptor  PD-1, 
showed antitumor  activity.21-24 
 
Results  from the studies  of pembrolizumab in advanced tumors, including gastric,  show  promising  activity  
and tolerability  from this novel  monoclonal  antibody.  The phase I KEYNOTE- 012 trial investigated  the safety,  
tolerability, and antitumor  activity  of pembrolizumab in gastric  cancer  pts.25 Only patients  with distinctive  
stromal  or ≥1% tumor  nest cell PD-L1 staining were  included.  Of 162 pts screened, 65 (40%)  were  PD-L1+ 
and 39 enrolled. Median  age was 63 y, and 72% of pts were  men.  66% of pts were  heavily  pretreated (≥2 
prior therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]).  Median  follow -up duration was > [ADDRESS_250770]  common  AEs deemed  treatment  related  
by [CONTACT_209841]  (n = 5 each). Grade ≥3 AEs deemed treatment  related  
occurred in 3 pts (n = 1 each  for hypoxia,  peripheral  neuropathy, and pneumonitis).  ORR  was 30.8%.  
Responses  were  ongoing for 11/12 pts (median response duration not reached;  range 8+ to 20+ wk). 41% 
of patients  with heavily  pretreated  disease experienced a decrease  in tumor  burden.  Evidence  of an 
association between PD-L1 expression  and PFS (P = 0.032)  and ORR  (P = 0.071)  was observed.While  
comparison  of results  between different  trials is imprecise,  the response  rate compared favorable to single - 
agent irinotecan or paclitaxel  in the second -line setting.26 Keynote  059 is a recently  initiated Phase II, 3 cohort  
trial exploring activity  of pembrolizumab alone or in combination with 5-Fu and cisplatin in 1) patients  who

response rate in first line setting is only 47% with trastuzumab in combination  with chemotherapy  and 
acquired and intrinsic resistance to trastuzumab limits  its efficacy. The short  duration of response in some  
patients  led to our hypothesis  that combined inhibition  of multiple oncogenic  pathways  that drive gastric  
cancer  growth may achieve  a greater  therapeutic  benefit. Some  anticancer  agents,  in addition  to their direct  
cytotoxic  effects  on tumor  cells,  feature the ability  to promote the activation by [CONTACT_209842],  activation  of the immune system  of the host, resulting in enhanced  antitumor  responses.[ADDRESS_250773] twofold immunogenic  effects. Fluropyrimidine demonstrates  T-cell-

TDB with anti-PD-L1 yielded  a combination  immunotherapy  that enhanced tumor  growth  inhibition,  
increasing the rates  and durability  of therapeutic  response.33 
 
Phase Ib data from ongoing KN014 -PANACEA trial ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED])  indicate that the combination of 
pembrolizumab and trastuzumab  is safe. The Phase Ib part was completed without  any safety  concerns  
and the study  has entered  the Phase  II part (confidential  data from [COMPANY_006]). 
 
Based on these data showing  synergistic effect, we hypothesize that enhanced NK cell degranulation and

3.5 Rationale  for Dose  Selection/Regimen/Modification  
An open- label Phase I trial (Protocol  001) is being conducted  to evaluate the safety  and clinical activity  of 
single  agent MK-3475 (pembrolizumab). The dose escalation  portion  of this trial evaluated three dose levels,  
1 mg/kg,  3 mg/kg,  and 10 mg/kg,  administered  every  2 weeks  (Q2W)  in subjects  with advanced solid tumors.  
All three  dose levels  were  well tolerated and no dose- limiting  toxicities  were  observed.  This first in human  
study  of MK-3475 showed evidence  of target  engagement and objective evidence  of tumor  size reduction  
at all dose levels  (1 mg/kg,  3 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg  Q2W).  No MTD has been identified  to date.   Recent data 
from other  clinical studies  within the MK-3475 program  has shown that a lower  dose of MK-3475 and a less 
frequent  schedule may be sufficient for target  engagement  and clinical activity.

PK data analysis  of MK-3475 administered Q2W  and Q3W  showed slow systemic clearance,  limited  volume  
of distribution,  and a long half-life (refer  to IB). Pharmacodynamic  data (IL-2 release  assay)  suggested that 
peripheral  target  engagement is durable  (>21 days).  This early PK and pharmacodynamic  data provides  
scientific  rationale for testing a Q2W  and Q3W  dosing schedule. 
 
A population  pharmacokinetic  analysis  has been performed using serum  concentration time data from [ADDRESS_250776] a wide 
therapeutic  range  based on the melanoma  indication.  The differences  in exposure for a 200 mg fixed dose 
regimen  relative  to a 2 mg/kg  Q3W  body weight  based regimen are anticipated to remain well within the 
established exposure  margins  of 0.5 – 5.0 for MK-3475 in the melanoma  indication. The exposure  margins  
are based  on the notion of similar  efficacy  and safety  in melanoma at 10 mg/kg Q3W  vs. the proposed  dose 
regimen  of 2 mg/kg Q3W  (i.e. 5-fold higher  dose and exposure).  The population PK evaluation revealed  that 
there was no significant  impact  of tumor  burden on exposure.  In addition,  exposure  was similar  between the 
NSCLC and melanoma indications.  Therefore,  there are no anticipated changes  in exposure  between  
different  indication  settings.  
 
The rationale for further  exploration of 2 mg/kg and comparable doses  of pembrolizumab in solid tumors  is 
based on: 1) similar  efficacy  and safety  of pembrolizumab  when dosed at either  2 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg  Q3W  
in melanoma patients,  2) the flat exposure- response relationships  of pembrolizumab for both efficacy  and 
safety  in the dose ranges  of 2 mg/kg  Q3W  to 10 mg/kg  Q3W,  3) the lack of effect of tumor  burden or 
indication  on distribution behavior  of pembrolizumab (as assessed  by [CONTACT_209844])  and 4) the 
assumption that the dynamics of pembrolizumab  target  engagement will not vary meaningfully  with tumor  
type. 
 
The choice of the 200 mg Q3W  as an appropriate dose for the switchto fixed dosing is based on simulations  
performed using the population PK model  of pembrolizumab  showing that the fixed dose of 200 mg every  3 
weeks  will provide exposures  that 1) are optimally  consistent with those  obtained with the 2 mg/kg  dose 
every  3 weeks,  2) will maintain individual  patient  exposures  in the exposure range  established in melanoma  
as associated with maximal  efficacy  response and 3) will maintain individual  patients  exposure  in the 
exposure range established in melanoma that are well tolerated and safe.  
 
A fixed dose regimen will simplify  the dosing  regimen  to be more  convenient  for physicians and to reduce  
potential  for dosing errors. A fixed dosing scheme will also reduce complexity  in the logistical  chain at 
treatment  facilities  and reduce wastage.

unstable (MSI)  harbored  DNA hypermethylation  (distinct from that of EBV tumors)  and had elevated somatic  
mutation  rates  with highly  recurrent  mutations  of PIK3CA  (42%)  and ERBB3  (26%)  with 12% of tumor  having  
alterations  of both genes.  3) Tumors  with chromosomal  instability (CIN)  showed marked aneuploidy.  While  
lacking  common mutations  of PIK3CA/ERBB3  they harbored  recurrent amplifications  of receptor  tyrosine  
kinases,  most  notably  HER2  (24%). 4) Tumors  lacking  aneuploidy  and elevated  rates  of mutation or 
hypermethylation  were  termed genomically  stable (GS),  largely  those of the diffuse histologic  subtype.  We 
identified  that 30% of these tumors  harbored  novel  alterations  of the Rho signaling pathway, somatic  
mutations  of RHOA or fusion  genes  involving  RHO  GTPase  activating proteins.  This classification structure  
creates  a foundation  to develop  rational  therapeutics   for distinct groups   of patients.  At MSKCC  next 
generation sequencing and gene copy number  analysis  is routinely  performed on all advanced gastric  
tumors. Whole exome sequencing is also routinely  done on site at MSK for biomarker  development in setting  
of clinical  trials.  
 
Immune  checkpoint  blockade has led to durable  antitumor  effects  in patients  with metastatic  melanoma,  non–  
small -cell lung cancer,  and other  tumor  types,  but the factors  determining whether  a patient will have a 
response remain  elusive.  The relationship among  the genomic  landscape of the tumor,  the mutational  load, 
and the benefit from treatment  has been  under  investigation at MSK in laboratory  of Timothy  Chan  and 
recently  published in NEJM40. Whole -exome  sequencing was performed on melanoma tumors  and matched  
blood samples.  Somatic  mutations  and candidate  neoantigens  generated from these mutations  were 
characterized. Snyder  et al reported  that mutational  load was associated with the degree of clinical  benefit  
(P=0.01) but alone was not sufficient  to predict  benefit. Using  genome wide somatic  neoepi[INVESTIGATOR_209811] -specific HLA typi[INVESTIGATOR_007], MSK investigators  identified  candidate tumor  neoantigens  for each patient and 
elucidated  a neoantigen  landscape that is specifically  present  in tumors  with a strong response  to CTLA -[ADDRESS_250779] whole exome  and

assess variation  in level of HER2  and target  engagement in both the primary  tumor  and all sites of

89Zr-trastuzumab PET is feasible  and provides   exceptional  image  quality  in HER2+  gastric  cancer

3.6.5  PD-L1 as Biomarker for Anti–PD-[ADDRESS_250788] results. Furthermore,  narrowing treatment  down to PD-L1-positive patients  could  
exclude patients  who benefit  from these treatments. PD-L1 is a very dynamic  marker —it can fluctuate over 
the course of the disease and treatment. Until more  is learned, it remains  problematic  to use PD-L1 as a 
biomarker.  If PD-L1 is not the best marker,  there may be another  T-regulatory  cell that can be measured.  
There needs  to be a strategy  for selecting patients  who will not benefit from treatment. An important  aspect  
of development program  for pembrolizumab in esophagogastric  cancer  is identification of a biomarker  for 
patient selection.  PD-L1 expression  in tumor  tissue will be characterized by [CONTACT_9064]  (IHC)  to 
explore the relationship  between  PD-L1 expression and response to pembrolizumab. Other  exploratory  
biomarkers  including  but not limited  to PD-1 expression,  markers  of T-cell phenotype may also be 
evaluated.

intolerable toxicity,  or other  withdrawal  criteria  are observed.  After 1 year,  at the treating  investigator's  
discretion, capecitabine treatment can be discontinued.  
 
5.7 Preparation and Administration  of 5-Fluorouracil  
Investigators  should consult the manufacturer’s  instructions for 5-FU for complete prescribing  information and 
follow  institutional  procedures  for the administration of 5-FU. 
 
Only for patients  unable to take oral medications  (because of certain circumstances  such as malabsorption,  
difficulty swallowing,  or other  conditions  that could affect intake of oral capecitabine  medication),  5-FU may be 
administered  instead,  at a dose of 800 mg/m2/day as a continuous  infusion over 5 days (Day  1 to Day 5 of 
each cycle),  every  21 days.  This decision should be made prior to registration by [CONTACT_1963];  
switching from capecitabine to 5-FU, or vice versa,  will not be allowed during  the study.  5-FU will be 
administered  after completion  of the cisplatin infusion.  
 
5-FU will continue until progression  of disease, intolerable toxicity,  or other  withdrawal  criteria  are observed.  
After 1 year,  at the treating physician’s  discretion,  5-FU treatment  can be discontinued.

7.0 RECRUITMENT  PLAN  
 
Potential  research subjects  will be identified by [CONTACT_209849]’s  treatment  team,  the protocol  
investigator  or research  team  at participating  institutions.  If the investigator  is a member  of the 
treatment  team,  s/he will screen their patient’s  medical  records  for suitable  research study  
participants.  The investigator  will use information provided  by [CONTACT_5363]/or  medical  record  to 
confirm  that the patient  is eligible  and contact  [CONTACT_46443].  All eligible  
patients,  regardless  of sex and race,  will be approached for participation.  No additional  measures,  
e.g. advertisement,  payment  to patients,  will be employed  to recruit  patients.  
 
During  the initial  conversation between the investigator/research staff and the patient, the patient  
may be asked to provide certain health information that is necessary  to the recruitment  and 
enrollment  process.  Participation in the study  is completely voluntary.  Patients  will be required  to 
read,  agree  to, and sign an IRB-approved informed  consent form prior to registration  on this trial. 
Patients  will not receive  payment  for their participation  on this study.  Patients  are free to withdraw  
from the study  without  consequence  at any time.  
Inclusion of women  and minorities  
 
The investigators  take due notice of the NIH policy concerning inclusion of women  and minorities  in 
clinical research  populations.  There  will be no limitation  with regards  to race or gender.  
 
Our institutional  demographics  for accrual  of patients  on esophageal,  gastric  and GE junction cancer  
trials reflect the national  incidence of this disease: 10-15% of our patients  have been women;  African - 
American  males  comprise 3-5% of patients  treated  on protocol.  Given  that our protocol  accrual  
closely  reflects  the national  incidence of this disease, no specific  strategy  will be undertaken to recruit  
women or persons  of color  on this trial. None  of the eligibility requirements  (section 6) will make  it 
difficult  for diverse  populations  to participate in this trial. 
 
This protocol  does  not include  children because  the number  of children  with esophageal, gastric  and 
GE junction  cancer  is very small  and because the majority are already  accessed  by a nation- wide 
pediatric  cancer  research network.  This statement is based on exclusion  4b of the NIH Policy  and 
Guidelines  on the Inclusion of Children as Participants  in Research Involving  Human Subjects.  
 
 
8.1 PRETREATMENT  EVALUATION  
 
Pretreatment  evaluation  will be performed  within 2 weeks  of study  entry  and will include: 
• History,  concomitant  medications, and toxicity assessment.  
• Physical  exam,  vital signs,  and performance status  (ECOG).  
• Serum  or urine pregnancy  test for women  of childbearing potential  (WOCP) 
In addition,  all WOCP  should be instructed to contact  [CONTACT_209850] (e.g. late or missed  period)  at any time 
during study  participation.  
• Laboratory  evaluation   including  complete blood  count,  magnes ium, comprehensive  
chemistry  panel  (includes  BUN,  creatinine,  ALT, AST,  albumin,  glucose, total protein,  
calcium,  bilirubin, bicarbonate,  sodium, chloride,  potassium, alkaline  phosphatase), and 
coagulation studies  (PT/PTT)

• Research blood   tests   including   plasma collection  for  cfDNA  analysis   and  whole   blood  
collection  for PBMC.  
 
 
The following must  be obtained within  one month  prior to starting protocol  therapy:  
• CT scan  of chest,  abdomen and pelvis  within 4 weeks  of study  entry  
• Electrocardiogram  
• Assessment  of Left Ventricular  Ejection Fraction (LVEF)  as measured by [CONTACT_209851]. The same method of measurement has to be used throughout the study.  
 
To be completed  any time prior to starting therapy: 
• Histological  confirmation  of esophageal, gastric  or GE junction adenocarcinoma at MSKCC  
prior to study  enrollment. 
 
 
 
9.1 TREATMENT/INTERVENTION PLAN 
 
Treatment  will be administered on an outpatient basis.  Pembrolizumab 200 mg IV every  3 weeks,  
trastuzumab  (8 mg/kg loading  dose;  6 mg/kg maintenance)  IV every  3 weeks  with cisplatin IV every  3 
weeks  with oral capecitabine 2 weeks  on/1 week  off. Each  cycle  consists of 21 days.  Treatment  will be 
administered  on an outpatient basis.   In Cycle  1, patients  will initiate therapy  with trastuzumab  8 mg/kg IV 
with pembrolizumab [ADDRESS_250815]/MRI  scan  will be performed after the initial  3 weeks  (1 cycle)  to 
determine response to pembrolizumab and trastuzumab  combination.  With subsequent  cycles,  all patients  
will begin systemic  chemotherapy  with the capecitabine/5 -FU, and a cisplatin/oxaliplatin  regimen  in 
addition to pembrolizumab 200 mg IV with trastuzumab 6 mg/kg  maintenance.   Patients  will receive  
cisplatin  80 mg/m2 IV on Day 1, and capecitabine  850mg/m2 twice  a day on Days  1 through 14, every  3 
weeks.  Treatment  will be performed  on the scheduled day ± [ADDRESS_250816] not been met. Evaluation in person  
will be made  when  there is concern for a drug-related toxicity irrespective  of grade.  
 
 
9.2 Correlative  Studies Research  
 
9.2.1  Sample Acquisition and DNA  Preparation 
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 16 -937 A(13)  
Approval date: [ADDRESS_250817] whole -exome  sequencing of DNA from 
tumors  and matched normal  blood from patients  that responded  to trial therapy  (PR or prolonged SD) and 
compare to the analysis  of ‘non- responders’..  DNA will be extracted,  and exon capture will be performed  
with the use of the SureSelect  Human All Exon  50-Mb kit (Agilent  Technologies).  Enriched exome  libraries  
were  sequenced on the HiSeq  2000 platform  (Illumina)  to provide  mean exome  coverage of more  than 100×  
(Memorial  Sloan  Kettering  Cancer  Center  Genomics  Core  and Broad  Institute).  
Immunogenicity  Analysis  of Somatic Mutations 
MSK investigators  (Chan  and Snyder)  created a bioinformatic  tool to translate all mutations  in exomes  and 
then evaluate binding  with major  histocompatibility  complex  (MHC)  class I molecules. The neoantigen  
signature [CONTACT_209876] a long- term benefit from therapy.  
Intracellular  Cytokine Staining  
Candidate  neoantigen  peptides  will be synthesized (GenScript),  cultured  with autologous  peripheral -blood  
mononuclear  cells (PBM Cs), and then analyzed  by [CONTACT_209852]- 2, 
CD107a,  macrophage inflammatory  protein 1β, tumor  necrosis  factor  α, and interferon- γ on restimulation of 
cells with the candidate  peptides.  
9.2.[ADDRESS_250818]  patients,  89Zr-trastuzumab PETs  will be performed on IRB 13 -165. The patients  willing to  
undergo  additional  imaging on protocol  13-165 and that meet eligibility  criteria  for both protocols  will be 
approached for IRB 13-165.  We will assess 89Zr-trastuzumab PET uptake  as a predictor  of tumor  
response. We will compare the proportion of patients  with a drop in 89Zr-trastuzumab tumor  uptake  on PET 
(pre-therapy  and at 3-wk) of 30% or greater  in the responder  versus  in the nonresponder  groups.  Fisher's  
exact  test will be used to determine the significance  of the association. 89Zr-trastuzumab PET imaging  will 
be an exploratory  study,  with only a select  subset  of MSK patients  on this trial with measurable disease  
undergoing imaging with 89Zr-trastuzumab PET.   If deemed appropriate,  MSK patients  will be approached  
for participation in the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_209817] 89Zr-trastuzumab PET  in HER2+  EG tumors, MSKCC  
protocol  IRB13 -165. 
9.2.3  Collection  of peripheral blood mononuclear  cells  (PBMC) and plasma  for immunologic  
analyses  
Whole blood  will be used for isolation  of peripheral  blood mononuclear  cells (PBM Cs). Flow cytometry  will 
be performed  on PBMCs  at baseline  and during treatment  to assess changes  in composition/activation  
status  of lymphocyte subsets, including  CD8+  and CD4+  T-cell subsets  (activated;  effector/memory;  
regulatory)  and populations  of those cells as defined by [CONTACT_209853],  exhaustion, or 
signaling  markers  such  as ICOS,  HLA- DR, PD-1, CTLA -4, and/or  intracellular  IFNγ.  
 
Approximately  32 ml of whole blood per visit (baseline and wks 1, 2, 3, 6, 10, 13, and EOT post-dosing)  
will be collected at ambient  temperature into 4 x 8-ml BD sodium  heparin Cell Preparation Tubes  (CPT)  for 
density  gradient centrifugation and isolation of PBMC and plasma for banking according to institutional  
procedures  at the Memorial  Sloan -Kettering  Cancer  Center  Ludwig Center  for Cancer  Immunotherapy  
Immune Monitoring Core  Facility.   After centrifugation,  the plasma supernatant  will be collected  and then 
the PBMC monolayer  isolated and washed.   PBMC  will resuspended at ~6-8 million  cells per vial in cell 
freezing medium,  frozen  at –80 degrees  C in controlled rate cooling  containers,  and then cryopreserved  in 
liquid nitrogen freezers.  Plasma  will be frozen in 1.5 ml aliquots  and stored at –20 degrees  C.

9.2.4  Collection  of blood of cell-free  DNA (cfDNA ) 
 
Cell-free DNA (cfDNA)  be obtained  from plasma samples  collected at baseline,  week  3, every  9 weeks,  
and at the time of treatment  discontinuation  
Approximately  20 ml of whole blood  per visit (baseline,  every  9 weeks,  and treatment  discontinuation)  will 
be collected at ambient  temperature into 2x 10mL  cell free DNA BCT tubes  for plasma  isolation.  
9.2.[ADDRESS_250819]  of development program  for pembrolizumab in esophagogastric  cancer  is 
identification of a biomarker  for patient selection.  PD-L1 expression in tumor  tissue will be characterized  
by [CONTACT_9064]  (IHC)  to explore  the relationship  between PD-L1 expression and response to 
pembrolizumab. Other  exploratory  biomarkers  including  but not limited to PD-[ADDRESS_250820]- treatment tumor  biopsies  will be used to evaluate biomarker  expression  and target inhibition  
(described below).  In addition, archived tissue from prior tumor  biopsies  obtained at the time of cancer  
diagnosis,  and prior to initiation  of trastuzumab will be analyzed,  when available.  Our primary  aims  are to 
identify  changes  in expression  of specific  biomarkers  or in the genomic  HER2  sequence as a result  of 
pembrolizumab and trastuzumab therapy  in patients  with HER2 -overexpressed esophagogastric  cancer.  
After obtaining  informed  consent, a diagnostic  biopsy  will be performed either  by [CONTACT_209854]  
(sonogram  guided core biopsy  or stereotactic  biopsy)  or endoscopy.  The appropriate type of diagnostic  
biopsy  will be determined by [CONTACT_209855].  
The biopsy  specimen will be accessioned and sent to pathology  for routine  analysis  (histology,  tumor,  
grade,  HER2  by [CONTACT_9064]  (IHC), and HER2  by [CONTACT_26707]  (FISH)). 
Where possible,  multiple cores will be obtained. When only one core is obtained, half the core will be snap  
frozen using  liquid  nitrogen with a selection evaluated for the presence of invasive  carcinoma by a 
participating pathologist  and stored for later analysis.  The second and larger  sample will be formalin fixed 
and used for IHC studies. 
• The number  of biopsies  taken  will be based on the clinical judgement  of the endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_541],  
sugergeon,  or intervential  radiologist,  but ideally  will be less than or equal  to four. 
• Tumor  DNA (post -treatment)  will be isolated for whole  exome sequencing and compared to 
genomic  DNA from PBMC in order  to identify  tumor -specific  mutations.  Candidate neo- 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_209818]- prediction  algorithms,  such  as SYFPEITHI.  
Candidate neo-epi[INVESTIGATOR_209819],  if

o Baseline ECHO/MUGA  must be obtained within  one month prior to starting protocol  therapy. ECHO  with speckle  
tracking will be the preferred modality  for LVEF assessment.  When possible,  the same  method  used to measure  
LVEF  at baseline (either  ECHO  or MUGA)  should be used throughout  the study.  Repeat   LVEF  assessments  
will be performed after 6 and 12 weeks  of initiating protocol  therapy, and thereafter  every  12 weeks  (4 cycles). 
Window of +/-14 days  for ECHO/MUGA.  
p To avoid  deviations  from the protocol,  blood tests, CT/MRI  scans,  optional  research  biopsies,  and physician  
visits (including physical  exam,  vitals, blood pressure,  weight,   performance  status,   and  concomitant  
medications)  may vary  by [CONTACT_209858]  (1-14) days  to allow  flexibility  of scheduling.  
q Upon treating investigator discretion,  O xaliplatin (130 mg/m2 infusion on Day 1 of Cycle 2 and on) may be 
considered. Patients  may begin with reduced dose of oxaliplatin  104 mg/m2 as starting  dose  if deemed  
necessary  per the treating  physician  discretion.  The decision to treat with oxaliplatin or cisplatin needs  to be 
made  prior to treatment  initiation  by [CONTACT_209859].  Switching  between  oxaliplatin  and cisplatin  is not 
allowed.  
r Only for patients  unable  to take oral medications  (because  of certain circumstances, such  as malabsorption,  
difficulty  swallowing,  or other  conditions  that could affect  intake of oral capecitabine medication),  5 -FU (800 
mg/m2/day continuous  infusion on Day 1 to Day 5 of Cycle  2 and on) may be considered. The decision to t reat 
with capecitabine or 5-FU needs  to be made prior to initiation by [CONTACT_12707].  Switching  between  5- 
FU and capecitabine is not allowed.  Patients  who received  chemotherapy  upfront  and did not have an induction  
period with pembrolizumab/trastuzumab,   do not need  the 3 week  scan.

IRB Number: 16 -937 A(13)  
Approval date: [ADDRESS_250831] the confidentiality  of their health  
information.  The consent  will state  that some  of the biospecimens  will be saved to use for future  
research. 
 
Type of future use 
The consent  specifically  describes  the types  of future research that may be performed,  including  
use of tissues  to develop new drugs  with cancer -associated molecular  targets, development of cell 
lines,  future use of cell lines to define  cancer  phenotype and (somatic)  genotype,  DNA sequence  
analysis  of tumor  compared  to normal  and identification of tumor -associated proteins  as diagnostic  
or prognostic  markers. It will be stated that researchers  at MSK may either  keep indefinitely  or 
dispose of any leftover  blood  or tissues  or other  samples,  including DNA that the samples  contain.  
Blood  and tissues  will be stored with identifiers  in secure tissue  or fluid banks.   It is stated that the 
samples  could be lost or ruined  because of mechanical  failure,  and that MSK cannot  guarantee that 
samples  will be stored indefinitely. The samples  will be stored  for as long as deemed  useful  for 
research purposes.  
 
Consent  for future use and re-contact  
[CONTACT_209860] a series  of check  boxes  at the end of the consent if 1) they permit their 
biospecimen  samples  to be stored and used in future research  to learn about or prevent  cancer  or 
side effects  of treatment, or to develop new treatments; 2)  if they permit their samples  to be stored  
and used in future research  to learn  about, prevent, or treat diseases  other  than cancer;  or 3) if they 
permit their samples,  with personal  identifiers  protected,  to be used  for research about inherited  
genetic  factors, 4) if they permit their samples  to be used for genetic  analysis  of the tumor  and 
normal  tissue to learn about the causes  of cancer,  5) participants  are asked  if they agree  to be 
contact[CONTACT_209861] 6) if they consent to be contact[CONTACT_209862]. Finally, if not available (e.g. deceased),  if they 
wish to have their designee designated on the consent to be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530].  
 
Participants  will not be provided with specific  results  of research  tests  performed on their collected  
human biologic  specimens.  
 
Use of identifiable information for genetic  studies  
In the course of this research it is possible that some  patients  whose tumors  are analyzed  through  
investigational  “next -generation”  profiling  in a research (non- CLIA)  environment  will be found to 
have somatic  or germline  mutations  in genes  that are known  to be associated with an increased risk 
of cancer  or other  diseases.  It will be stated in the consent that the participants  will not receive any 
specific  results  from research  tests. The consent  will tell participants  that if they wish to have  
genetic  testing done for personal  reasons  than they should make  an appointment  with the MSK 
Clinical  Genetics  Service  or Clinical Genetics  Service  at their site. 
 
If in the course of this research a research finding  is obtained  that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871],  
may be critical  to the preventive  care of the participant  or their family,  the investigator  can 
communicate that finding to the MSK IRB Genomic  Advisory  Panel  (GAP).  The finding  will be 
reviewed  by [CONTACT_209863].  For MSK patients,  in the event  that the GAP determines  that the finding  should be 
discussed with the participant,  and the participant  has consented  to be re-contact[INVESTIGATOR_530],  then the 
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center

treating/consenting physician  shall be contact[CONTACT_209864]. 
 
The following information must  be provided to GAP for review:  
• Participant  Name/MRN  # 
• Type  of Biospecimen (tissue,  blood, saliva)  
• Incidental  Finding  
• Collection Protocol  # 
• Contact: [EMAIL_4081]  
 
For non-MSK  patients  being treated  at one of the participating institutions,  if the GAP determines  
the finding  to be reportable  to the participant  and the participant  has consented to be re-contact[INVESTIGATOR_530],  
results  will be returned to the Site Principal  Investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_209820].   Site policies  on 
returning these research findings  to the patient should be followed.  
 
We anticipate that other  research assays  may be incorporated into this protocol  as technology  
evolves.  
 
Voluntariness  of research participation 
It is stated that taking  part in this tissue and blood  bank is voluntary  and patients  have the right to 
withdraw  at any time. Participation in the study  will not impact  on the clinical care patients  receive.  
 
W ithdrawal  
Participants  may decide at a later date that they do not want identified  blood and tissue  samples  to 
be stored in the tissue bank and /or used for future research.  If participants  decide to withdraw  from 
the study,  specimens that have not yet left the specimen archive  will not be used in new studies  and 
any remaining portions  of samples  that have not been used for research will be used only for clinical  
purposes  or, if requested  by [CONTACT_102], destroyed.   For specimens  already  shipped out from the 
archive,  it may not be possible to locate the samples  or stop already  ongoing research.  When a 
participant  withdraws  from the protocol,  MSK’s  Protocol  Participant  Registration (PPR) Office should  
be notified immediately.  If a non-MSK  participant  withdraws  from the study,  the MSK study  staff 
member  will notify  PPR.  The withdrawal  request  will be documented  in CRDB and the system  
updated accordingly.  In addition,  a note-to-file documenting the patient withdrew  must  be filed in 
his/her  medical  records.  
 
Rights  after death  
The consent  states  that if the research participant  dies or is unable  to make  his/her  wishes  known,  
all of their rights  to decide about future uses of the blood  or tissues will pass to the authorized  
representative of the estate.  If there  is no representative of the estate,  the rights  pass to  the next of 
kin. 
 
Risks of research participation  
The greatest risk is release of information from health  or research records  in a way that violates  
privacy  rights.  MSK and any participating  sites will protect records  so that name,  address, phone  
number,  and any other  information that identifies  the participant  will be kept private.  It will be stated  
to the participant  that the chance that this information will be given  to an unauthorized  individual  
without  the participant’s  permission is very small.  
 
Costs/compensation  
There is no cost to the participant  to enroll  in this research.  Tissue or blood obtained in this research  
may be used to make  a cell line, and these may be patented or licensed and thus may have 
significant  commercial  value.   The participant  is informed that there are no plans  to provide financial

compensation for use of their human  biologic  specimens,  nor are there plans  for the participant  to 
receive  money  for any new products, tests, and discoveries that might come  from this research.  
 
Biospecimen  Privacy  
Medical  information is confidential.   The participant’s  personal  identity  will not be used in reports  
that are written  about the research.   The MSK IRB/PB will review  all requests  for research  
performed involving  biospecimens  ascertained through this protocol.   Blood  and tissue  samples  
may be stored with a code linked to the patient’s  medical  record. The results  of any research using  
blood  or tissues  will not be placed in the medical  record.  
 
The consent  indicates  that samples  and genetic  information collected may be shared with other  
qualified researchers  and placed in online  databases.  An example  of an online  database  is the NIH 
dbGAP  database,  which is monitored  by [CONTACT_154108],  and may be made  
accessible to investigators  approved  by [CONTACT_941] U.S. government.  Such  information will not include  
identifying information such  as name. It is also stated in the Research Authorization (HIPAA  
Authorization)  that research data (e.g. genomic  sequence)  may be shared with regulators.  The 
requirements  for submission of genotype/phenotype data into the NIH dbGAP  or any other  public  
database  will be followed  as per the IRB SOP  for Genomic  Data Sharing.  
 
Use of banked samples  (at MSK)  
When samples  are to be analyzed,  the individual  investigator  needs  to write an IRB biospecimen  
protocol.  This protocol  is fast-tracked  through MSK Research Council  review  and is reviewed  at the 
MSK IRB by [CONTACT_209865]. This protocol  is only for research  that will be done on 
biospecimens  obtained  under  identified protocols  and their informed consent and research  
authorization  that include  the institutional  future use questions.  The consent and research  
authorization  for the use of the biospecimens  will be waived as per 45 CFR 46.116(d)  and 45 CFR 
164.512(i)(2)(ii). 
 
 
11.1 TOXICITIES/SIDE  EFFECTS  
 
The treating investigator  or qualified  designee will assess  each subject to evaluate for potential  new 
or worsening  AEs as specified in the Trial Flow Chart  (see Section 10.0)  and more  frequently  if 
clinically indicated.   Adverse experiences  will be graded and recorded throughout  the study  and 
during  the follow -up period according to NCI CTCAE Version  4.0.  Toxicities  will be characterized in 
terms  regarding seriousness,  causality,  toxicity  grading, and action  taken with regard  to trial 
treatment.  For subjects  receiving  treatment  with pembrolizumab all AEs of unknown etiology  
associated with pembrolizumab exposure should  be evaluated to determine if it is possibly  an event  
of clinical  interest  (ECI)  of a potentially   immunologic  etiology  (termed immune- related adverse  
events, or irAEs).  
 
11.2 Pembrolizumab 
Adverse events  (both non-serious  and serious)  associated with pembrolizumab exposure may 
represent  an immunologic  etiology.  These  adverse events  may occur  shortly  after the first dose or 
several  months  after the last dose of treatment.  Pembrolizumab must  be withheld  for drug- related  
toxicities  and severe or life-threatening  AEs as per table 2 below.

11.1.1  Supportive Care  
 
• Pneumonitis : 
o For Grade  2 events,  treat with systemic corticosteroids. When symptoms improve  to 
Grade 1 or less, steroid  taper  should be started  and continued over no less than 4 
weeks.  
o For Grade  3-4 events,  immediately  treat with intravenous  steroids.  Administer  
additional  anti-inflammatory  measures, as needed.  
o Add prophylactic  antibiotics  for opportunistic  infections  in the case of prolonged steroid  
administration.

• Diarrhea/Colitis : 
Subjects  should be carefully  monitored for signs  and symptoms  of enterocolitis  (such  as 
diarrhea,  abdominal  pain, blood or mucus in stool,  with or without  fever)  and of bowel  
perforation (such  as peritoneal  signs  and ileus).  
 
o All subjects  who experience diarrhea/colitis  should be advised to drink  liberal  quantities  
of clear  fluids.  If sufficient oral fluid intake  is not feasible,  fluid and electrolytes  should  
be substituted via IV infusion.  For Grade 2 or higher  diarrhea, consider  GI consultation  
and endoscopy  to confirm  or rule out colitis.  
o For Grade  2 diarrhea/colitis that persists  greater  than 3 days,  administer  oral 
corticosteroids.  
o For Grade 3 or 4 diarrhea/colitis that persists  > 1 week,  treat with intravenous  steroids  
followed  by [CONTACT_78018].  
o When symptoms  improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper  should be started and 
continued over no less than 4 weeks.  
o Pembrolizumab  can be held until the patient is off corticosteroids.  
 
• Type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM) (if new onset, including  diabetic ketoacidos is [DKA]) or ≥ 
Grade  3 Hyperglycemia, if associated with ketosis (ketonuria)  or metabolic  acidosis  
(DKA ) 
 
o For Type  1 DM or Grade  3-4 Hyperglycemia  
 Insulin  replacement  therapy  is recommended for Type  I diabetes  mellitus  and 
for Grade 3-4 hyperglycemia  associated with metabolic  acidosis  or ketonuria. 
 Evaluate patients  with serum  glucose and a metabolic  panel, urine  ketones,  
glycosylated  hemoglobin, and C-peptide. 
 
• Hypophysitis:  
 
o For Grade  2 events,  treat with corticosteroids. When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or 
less, steroid taper  should be started and continued  over no less than 4 weeks.  
Replacement  of appropriate hormones  may be required as the steroid dose  is tapered.  
o For Grade  3-4 events,  treat with an initial dose of IV corticosteroids  followed by [CONTACT_79918]. When symptoms improve  to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper  should  be 
started and continued over no less than 4 weeks. Replacement  of appropriate  
hormones  may be required as the steroid  dose is tapered.  
 
• Hyperthyroidism or Hypothyroidism:  
Thyroid  disorders  can occur  at any time during  treatment.  Monitor  patients  for changes  in 
thyroid function (at the start of treatment,  periodically  during treatment,  and as indicated  
based on clinical  evaluation)  and for clinical signs  and symptoms  of thyroid  disorders.  
 
o Grade  2 hyperthyroidism  events  (and Grade 2-4 hypothyroidism):  
 In hyperthyroidism,  non-selective  beta- blockers  (e.g. propranolol)   are 
suggested as initial  therapy.  
 In hypothyroidism,  thyroid  hormone  replacement  therapy, with levothyroxine or 
liothyronine, is indicated per standard  of care.  
o Grade  3-4 hyperthyroidism  
 Treat  with an initial dose of IV corticosteroid followed by [CONTACT_78019].  
When symptoms  improve  to Grade 1 or less, steroid  taper  should be started  
and continued  over no less than 4 weeks.  Replacement  of appropriate  
hormones  may be required as the steroid  dose is tapered.

• Hepatic:  
o For Grade 2 events,   monitor  liver  function  tests  more  frequently   until  returned  to 
baseline values  (consider  weekly).  
 Treat  with IV or oral corticosteroids  
o For Grade  3-4 events,  treat with intravenous  corticosteroids  for 24 to 48 hours.  
 Treat  with IV methylprednisone 1-4 mg/kg  at investigator’s  discretion  
o When symptoms  improve  to Grade 1 or less, a steroid taper  should be started and 
continued over no less than 4 weeks.  
 
• Renal Failure or Nephritis:  
o For Grade 2 events,  treat with corticosteroids.  
o For Grade  3-4 events,  treat with systemic corticosteroids.  
o When symptoms  improve to Grade  1 or less, steroid taper  should be started and 
continued over no less than 4 weeks.  
• Management  of Infusion Reactions:  Signs  and symptoms  usually  develop during or shortly  
after drug infusion  and generally  resolve  completely  within  24 hours  of completion  of infusion.

cardiac  monitoring throughout  the study, including  at baseline,  6 and 12 weeks  after initiation  of 
trastuzumab  therapy,  and every  12 weeks  (4 cycles)  thereafter.  During  the course of trastuzumab  
therapy, patients  should be monitored  for signs  and symptoms  of CHF (i.e., dyspnea,  tachycardia,  new 
unexplained  cough,  neck vein distention, cardiomegaly,  hepatomegaly, paroxysmal  nocturnal  dyspnea,  
orthopnea, peripheral  edema,  and rapid unexplained weight  gain).  Patients  who develop signs  or 
symptoms of CHF will be further  evaluated with a repeat  LVEF  assessment  using the same method  
selected at baseline (either  ECHO  or MUGA)  if possible.  
 
 
Management  of Symptomatic  Cardiac  Changes  
Patients  who develop signs  and symptoms  of CHF should  have trastuzumab  held and should receive  
treatment  for CHF as recommended  by [CONTACT_14808]  (AHA)/American  College  of 
Cardiology  (ACC)(e.g.,  ACE inhibitors,  angiotensin- II receptor  blockers, β-blockers,  diuretics, and 
cardiac  glycosides,  as needed)  with referral  to cardiology  for consultation.  
 
If the symptoms  of CHF resolve  with treatment,  and/or  cardiac  function improves  to baseline,  reinitiation  
of trastuzumab can be considered at the discretion of the treating  investigator,  after discussion  with the 
patient concerning the risks and benefits  of continued  therapy  and in consultation with a cardiologist.  If 
the patient is benefiting clinically from trastuzumab, the benefit of continued  treatment  may outweigh  
the risk of cardiac  dysfunction or heart  failure. If trastuzumab  is restarted,  continued  surveillance  with 
noninvasive measures  of LVEF  (MUGA  or ECHO)  will resume as regularly  scheduled.  Additional  LVEF  
assessments  prior tothe next regularly  scheduled LVEF  measurement maybe  performed at the treating  
investigator’s  discretion.  
 
Management  of Asymptomatic  Decreases  in LVEF  
Trastuzumab can be continued  in patients  experiencing  an asymptomatic  absolute decrease in LVEF  of 
<16 percentage points  from baseline,  when the ejection  fraction  remains  within the imaging center's  
range of normal  limits.  Repeat  measures  of LVEF  should  be obtained using the methodology  selected  
at baseline  if possible. Closefollow-up of suchpatients is recommended. Patients  withan asymptomatic  
absolute decrease in LVEF  of >[ADDRESS_250838] trastuzumab  held.  Referral  to cardiology  
should be considered  for evaluation and management  of left ventricular  systolic dysfunction with 
adherence to ACC/AHA  guidelines. In light of the variability  inherent  in the assessment  of ejection  
fraction,  consideration  should be given to repeating the study  within 4-[ADDRESS_250839]. If 
trastuzumab  has been held for an asymptomatic  decline in LVEF,  a repeat  measure of LVEF  will be 
obtained  within  1 month  to evaluate  for recovery  of LVEF.  If LVEF  does  not improve  after repeat  
assessment  within 1 month,  the patient should  be monitored  with monthly  or as clinically indicated  
ECHOs/MUGAs  until LVEF  is improved.  
 
If cardiac  function improves  and LVEF  no longer  meets  “hold”  criteria  as defined above , trastuzumab  
may be restarted. If trastuzumab  is restarted,  continued surveillance with noninvasive  measures  of 
LVEF  (MUGA  or ECHO),  using the optimal  methodology  as determined by [CONTACT_209867],  will resume per the standard schedule.   Additional  LVEF  
 
Assessmentsprior tothe next regularly  scheduled LVEF  measurement maybeperformed at the treating  
investigator’s  discretion. If the patient is benefiting  clinically from trastuzumab, the benefit of continued  
treatment  may outweigh  the risk of cardiac  dysfunction even in the setting of an asymptomatic  LVEF  
decline,  and reinitiating  of trastuzumab  can be considered at the discretion of the treating investigator  
after consultation  with a cardiologist  and discussion with the patient concerning the risks and benefits  
of continued therapy.

Caution  should be exercised when  treating  patients  with clinically significant  cardiovascular  disease  
such  as pre-existing  coronary  artery  disease or CHF.  Patients  with symptomatic  CHF,  unstable  angina  
pectoris, or symptomatic  or poorly  controlled cardiac  arrhythmia should not be enrolled  in clinical trials 
with pembrolizumab. Pembrolizumab should be discontinued in the event  of any Grade  3 or 4 events  
consistent with CHF. 
 
 
11.2.3  Infusion- Related  Reactions  
Any treatment -related  infusion -related reactions  are defined according to the NCI-CTCAE Version 4.0 
definition (General  disorders  and administration  siteconditions). Symptoms occurring  during or following  
infusion  of investigational  therapy  may also be defined  according to AE categories  such as allergic  
reaction,  anaphylaxis,  or cytokine  release syndrome  (Immune  system  disorders). In the setting of 
symptoms occurring during or following infusion of investigationaltherapy, investigators are encouraged 
to use the AE term "infusion- related  reaction"  and any additional  terms  (including those not listed  here)  
that best describe the event.  Consistent with usual  medical  practice, the patient should be clinically  
monitored and selected parenteral  medications  may be utilized  for Grade 2 allergic/hypersensitivity  
reaction as detailed below. Clinical  and laboratory  monitoring will be performed  per institutional  
guidelines.  
 
Grade  1 IRR 
• Slow the infusion rate by 50%.  
• Monitor the patient for worsening of condition. 
• For subsequent  infusions,  premedicate  with diphenhydramine hydrochloride  50 mg I.V. (or 
equivalent); additional  premedication may be administered at the treating investigator's  
discretion.  
 
Grade  2 IRR 
• Stop the infusion  
• Administer  diphenhydramine hydrochloride  50 mg I.V. (or equivalent), acetaminophen 650 mg 
orally  for fever,  and oxygen.  
• Resume the infusion  at 50% of the prior rate once the IRR has resolved or decreased to Grade  
1; the infusion duration should not exceed  2 hours. 
• Monitor  for worsening  of condition.  
• For subsequent  infusions,  premedicate  with diphenhydramine hydrochloride  50 mg I.V. (or 
equivalent); additional  premedication may be administered at the treating investigator's  
discretion.  
 
For a second Grade 1 or 2 IRR, administer  dexamethasone 8-20 mg I.V. (or equivalent); then, for 
subsequent  infusions,  premedicate  with diphenhydramine hydrochloride  50 mg I.V. (or equivalent),  
acetaminophen 650 mg orally, and dexamethasone  8-20 mg I.V. (or equivalent).  
 
 
 
11.3 Capecitabine, 5-FU, Cisplatin,  and Oxaliplatin  Dose  Delays and Modifications  
For hematologic laboratory abnor malities as an initial step, the dose of capecitabine/5-FU/cisplatin/oxaliplatin 
should be reduced first before any dose reductions for pembrolizumab are considered. capecitabine/5- 
FU/cisplatin/oxaliplatin  will be held for grade 3 or 4 non-hematologic  toxicity (with the exception of grade  
3 electrolyte  abnormalities)  or for not meeting treatment  parameters  as described  in the tables  below  on 
the day of treatment.  If the toxicity  has resolved and the patient meets  treatment  parameters  but 
experienced  interval  toxicity,  then for the purposes  of determining dose reductions,  the grade of toxicity  
should be that seen despi[INVESTIGATOR_209827] (i.e. intensive loperamide or tincture of

opi[INVESTIGATOR_209828]).  If multiple toxicities  are seen  the dose administered  for a particular  drug should  be 
based on the most  severe toxicity  noted. In general,  when  multiple toxicities  are experienced  that can 
result in the dose  reduction of multiple drugs, reducing multiple drugs  at one time is the preferred  
approach.  Treatment  may resume when  the toxicity  has resolved  to < grade 2, except  as indicated  
below.  
 
Generally,  during the first six cycles  of therapy  when treatment  is held for chemotherapy  related  
toxicity,  all drugs  (cisplatin or oxaliplatin and capecitabine or 5-FU, Pembrolizumab/Trastuzumab)  will 
be held for coordinated scheduling.  Re-evaluation  visit should occur  in no more  than 7 days.  For an 
elevated creatinine or for ototoxicity,  cisplatin  or oxaliplatin alone  may be held at the treating  
investigator ’s discretion and the patient may continue with capecitabine  or 5-FU without  treatment  
delay.  If capecitabine  is held for more  than 4 weeks  for toxicity,  patients  will be taken  off study,  unless  
there is a clinical  benefit.  If there is a clinical benefit, patients  may be retreated at a lower  dose after 
resolution of toxicity  to ≤ NCI- CTCAE  v4.0 grade 2, except  as indicated below.  Cisplatin  or oxaliplatin  
and capecitabine or 5-FU may each be dose  attenuated,  either  in combination,  or individually.  For all 
toxicities,  appropriate clinical judgment  should be applied to manage the symptoms.  
 
Tables  11.4.1, 11.4.2,  11.4.3, 11.4.4, 11.4.5,  11.4.6, and 11.4.7 address  specific  chemotherapy  dose  
delays  and modifications  instructions.  Colony  stimulating  factors:  Patients  should  not routinely  
receive prophylactic  colony  stimulating  factors  (e.g.,  G-CSF,  GM-CSF)  during cycle  1.  Subsequent  
use will be at the discretion of the treating physician.

11.4 General  Dose- Modification  Guidelines for Chemotherapy  
• Treatment  for the first cycle  should only commence if all the inclusion  and exclusion  criteria are 
met and patient has been enrolled. For subsequent  cycles,  dose delay/modification  is permitted  
as described in sections  specific  for pembrolizumab,  trastuzumab,  capecitabine, 5-FU, cisplatin,  
and oxaliplatin.  All study  treatment  will be discontinued in case  of disease progression.  
• The dose of capecitabine or 5-FU should be determined at the start of each treatment  cycle.  
Based on treating investigator's  discretion,  full dose of capec itabinecan be re-administered after 
1 dose reduction  (25% dose reduction).  Re-escalation is not allowed  after the second dose 
reduction.  The maximum  number  of dose reductions  for capecitabine is 2 (50%  of the original  
dose).  
• Doses  of any study  drug omitted  for toxicity are not replaced or restored; instead, the patient  
should resume  the planned treatment  cycles.  Supportive care (for example,  colony -stimulating  
factors, blood  and blood products, etc. can be administered in accordance  with the latest  ASCO  
or other  equivalent  guidelines.  
• Dose  modification,  for non-serious and non-life-threatening toxicities  like alopecia,  altered  taste 
or nail changes  may not be required  and the final decision is left to the discretion of the treating  
investigator. 
• In situations  where concomitant toxicities  of varying severity exist,  dose modification will be 
tailored  for the toxicity with highest  CTCAE grading. 
• If there is a delay  or modification in administration of study  drug(s)  due to toxicity,  treatment  with 
the other  study  agent(s)  should also be held.  If clinically appropriate, the treating investigator  
can delay  all treatment  components  up to a maximum  of 7 days to allow  synchronized  
administration of all agents.  
• If a toxicity  related  to any component  of chemotherapy  does  not resolve  in the same  treatment  
cycle,  the administration  of that component  canbe delayed up to 63 days (9 weeks).  If the toxicity  
does  not resolve  within  63 days (9 weeks), that component  will be discontinued unless  it is 
determined by [CONTACT_209868]. 
If at least six months  have elapsed  since oxaliplatin  discontinuation,  oxaliplatin  may be reinitiated  at the 
last dose level for this patient at the investigator’s  discretion for clinical progression concern. 
 
12.0   CRITERIA FOR THERAPEUTIC RESPONSE/OUTCOME  ASSESSMENT  
 
All patients  who receive  at least one dose of pembrolizumab and began trastuzumab therapy  will be 
evaluable for toxicity  and response. Patients  who are did not begin  pembrolizumab therapy  will not be 
evaluated for toxicity  or response  and will be replaced by a new patient.  
The primary  endpoint  of this study  is to determine the six months  progression free survival (PFS)  in 
the first-line treatment  of patients  with Stage IV HER2  positive  esophagogastric  adenocarcinoma.  The 
same  imaging modality  performed  at baseline (CT or MRI) will be repeated at subsequent  imaging.  
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 16 -937 A(13)  
Approval date: 28 -Jul-2020  
Page  41 of 50  
  
 
 
Secondary  endpoints  include  toxicity,  overall  survival,  median PFS,  response to pembrolizumab + 
trastuzumab, best overall  RECIST  1.1 response  (CR+PR)  to capecitabine/5- FU, cisplatin/oxaliplatin,  
pembrolizumab and trastuzumab, overall  clinical benefit defined as stable disease (SD),  complete 
response rate (CR),  or partial  response (PR) safety  and tolerability. The type, frequency, severity,  
timing,  and relationship  of each adverse event  will be determined as per the NCI Common Toxicity  
Criteria,  version 4.0. Toxicity  during cycle  1 and subsequent  cycles will be reported.  
 
13.0     CRITERIAFOR REMOVAL FROM STUDY  
 
• If at any time the patient develops  progressive disease on combination  of trastuzumab,  
pembrolizumab,  and chemotherapy  he/she will be taken  off study  unless  the treating  
investigator  determines  that it is of clinical benefit,  defined as improvement  in quality  of life, 
function,  or general  well-being,  for the patient to continue on trial therapy.  If at least six months  
have elapsed  since  oxaliplatin  discontinuation,  oxaliplatin may be reinitiated  at the last dose 
level for this patient at the investigator’s  discretion  for clinical progression concern.  
If after nine weeks  of continued treatment  a second scan  shows  additional  disease progression,  
treatment  will be discontinued  and the patient will be taken off of study.  If at any time the patient  
develops  unacceptable toxicity that fails to resolve after a maximum  treatment  delay  of 9 weeks,  
he/she will be removed  from study.  Before being removed from the study,  patients  will be scanned  to 
assess the response. If the off study  scan  shows  progression of disease  then the patient will be 
considered as a non responder,  while a CR or PR will be considered as response.  
 
A patient  will be withdrawn  from the study  treatment  in the following circumstances:  
 
● The patient is no longer  able to participate in the study  (e.g.,  AE, surgery,  concomitant  
diagnoses,  concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_209830]);  in such  a case  the treating  
investigator’s  reason for a patient’s  removal  must  be recorded  in CRDB.  
● Patient  withdrawal  of consents  or election to discontinue participation in the trial 
● Significant  deviation from the protocol  or eligibility  criteria; such  patients  will be considered  
protocol  violations  and removed from study  
● Non-compliance  with study  or follow -up procedures  
● Drug  related  AE(s)  have not resolved  after 9 weeks  of treatment  interruption.  Exception to 
this in patients  who derive obvious  clinical  benefit according to the investigator’s  judgment  
could be considered upon discussion  with Principal  Investigator. The dose reduction  scheme  
provided  should be followed in this case. 
● Repeated epi[INVESTIGATOR_209831]  
11. 
● Documented  progressive  disease  
 
As soon as a patient is withdrawn from the study  treatment,  the End of Treatment  (EOT)  visit 
has to be performed within  1-14 days after off treatment  date.  Every  effort  should be made  to follow - 
up patients  in case  an adverse  event  is still ongoing at the time of withdrawal.  Patients  who show  a 
clinical benefit (i.e., with either  an objective  tumor  response  or the absence of disease progression),  
may continue  to receive additional  treatment  courses.  Patients  with radiologically  documented  
progressive disease  should  be removed  from the study  unless  the treating investigator  judges  it to be 
of clinical benefit for the patient to continue on trial therapy.

The phase III ToGA  study  established the benefit  of trastuzumab  in combination with cisplatin and 
fluoropyrimidine (CF) chemotherapy  in HER2 -positive  metastatic  EG adenocarcinoma. The  
trastuzumab/CF cohort from the ToGA  will be used as historic control  for this study.   In ToGA   
patients  assigned to receive  trastuzumab + CF had a significant  improvement  in progression free 
survival  (5.5 mos vs 6.7 mos,  HR 0.71 [0.59 -0.85],  p=0.0002 ),  overall  survival (13.8 mo vs 11.1 mo, 
HR 0.74 [0.6-0.91],  p = 0.0046). Approximately  55% of the capecitabine/cisplatin/trastuzumab - 
treated patients  were  progression free at 6 months.  The hypothesis  is that addition  of 
pembrolizumab to fluorpyrimidine and platinum  and trastuzumab will improve  outcome in previously  
untreated  patients  with HER2  gastric,  esophageal  or GE junction gastric  adenocarcinoma.  
The primary  endpoint  is 6-month progression  free survival (PFS), as measured  from the start of the 
treatment  with trastuzumab  and pembrolizumab  to the date of either  documentation of disease  
progression on fluoropyrimidine and platinum  with trastuzumab and pembrolizumab or death.  
Patients  with disease progression on pembrolizumab and trastuzumab will be removed  from study  
per the rules described in section 13.0..  We will define progression of disease to capecitabine/5- FU, 
and a cisplatin/oxaliplatin with trastuzumab and pembrolizumab per RECIST  1.[ADDRESS_250844]  single  stage binomial  design,  we will accrue 37 Stage IV  esophageal,  
gastric  and GE junction adenocarcinoma patients  to differentiate between  6-month PFS of 55% and 
75% with type I of 5% and power  of 80%. After week  9, CT/MRI  scans  occurring every  [ADDRESS_250845]/MRI  scan,  and if necessary,  an additional  scan  will be done at 6 
months.  If there is a delay  in treatment  for a patient the 6 month scan  will not be delayed.  If 26 or 
more  patients  are progression free at 6 months,  capecitabine/5- FU, cisplatin/oxaliplatin  and 
trastuzumab  + pembrolizumab will be considered worthy  of further  investigation.   Patients  who come  
off study  before 6 months  without  documented progression will be considered as events  for the 
primary  endpoint  of 6 months  PFS.  We anticipate enrollment  to be 1-2 patients/months  with 
completion  of accrual  in approximately  [ADDRESS_250846] to follow  up or withdrew  consent before 6 months  
without  documented  progression  will be counted as events  for the primary  endpoint;  however  this is 
expected to be a rare occurrence.  
The patients  who completed at least one cycle  of trastuzumab  + pembrolizumab will be considered  
evaluable.  
Secondary  and exploratory  endpoints  include:  
 
• Calculation of the rate of best RECIST  1.1. response (CR+PR)  estimated  using binomial  
proportions  along with 95% confidence intervals;  median PFS,  overall  and 1-year survival in 
patients  with HER2+  Stage IV esophageal, gastric  or GEJ adenocarcinoma  will be measured  
from the start of treatment  to death or last follow -up. 
• Perform  correlative analyses  including  whole exome analysis  in order  to determine mutation  
load and specific  neoantigen  landscape with strong association in patients  with regimen  
efficacy  (PR, CR or prolonged SD). The Mann– Whitney  test will be used  to compare  
mutational  loads.

• Correlate the change  in uptake on 89Zr-trastuzumab PET with changes  in tumor  size on CT in 
patients  receiving  study  therapy. We will compare  the proportion of patients  with a drop in 
89Zr-trastuzumab tumor  uptake  on PET (pre-therapy  and at 3-wk) of 30% or greater  in the 
responder  versus  in the nonresponder  groups.  Fisher's  exact  test will be used to determine  
the significance of the association. This will be conducted for MSK patients  only. 
• Determine overall  clinical benefit defined  as stable disease (SD),  complete  response rate (CR),  
or partial  response (PR) safety  and tolerability.  They  will be summarized  using binomial  
proportions  along  with exact  95% CI. 
• Generalized estimating equations  (GEE) will be used to look at associations  between  
response and PBMC and cfDNA  while Cox regression  with time dependent  covariate will be

• PD-L1 will be associated with response using Fisher's  exact  test while  log-rank test will be 
used to compare survival  curves  between PD-L1 positive and negative  patients. 
 
Previous  clinical trials have reported  the frequency  of adverse  events  attributable to treatment  with 
capecitabine,  cisplatin,  and trastuzumab. A similar  frequency  of adverse  events  will be considered  
attributable to the capecitabine,  cisplatin and trastuzumab plus pembrolizumab  used in this trial and 
therefore  acceptable.  In order  to reduce patient risk, the study  design includes  early termination of 
the trial in the event  of excessive  grade 4+ neutropenia, grade  3+ diarrhea  despi[INVESTIGATOR_209832]  (loperamide  and diphenoxylate/atropi[INVESTIGATOR_050])   or grade  3+ neuropathy. In 
addition,  the safety  analysis  will assess the toxicity rates  that may arise related to pembrolizumab  
persistent grade 3+ hypertension  despi[INVESTIGATOR_209833].  Furthermore,  presence of 
grade 3+ events  which in the clinical  judgment  of the MSK Principal  Investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_209834], unexpected, and a side effect likely  due to pembrolizumab , will give evidence to reduce the 
dose as well.  Adverse events  (possibly,  probably, or definitely)  related to the study  treatment  during  
all treatment  cycles will count  towards  the excessive  toxicity boundaries  below.  The stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_209835].

15.3 Randomization  
 
16.1 DATA MANAGEMENT ISSUES 
 
A Research Study  Assistant  (RSA),  or equivalent  at each participating site, will be assigned to 
the study.  The responsibilities  of the MSK RSA include  project  compliance,  data collection,  
abstraction  and entry,  data reporting,  regulatory  monitoring,  problem  resolution and 
prioritization, and coordinate the activities  of the protocol  study  team.  
The data collected for this study  will be entered into a secure  database, Clinical  Research  
Database (CRDB) Source documentation will be available  to support  the computerized patient  
record. Anonymization  will take place at the point of entry  into the database.  Subsequent  
laboratory  analysis  will take place on the anonymized  samples.  
MSK will be the data coordinating  center  under  the guidance of the Multicenter  Protocol  
Executive  Committee  (MPEC).  MSKCC  will be responsible for reporting to the funding source  
(as applicable)  and governing  agencies.  
Tumor  slides from MSK and the participating  sites will be stored in the MSK pathology  
laboratory. Results  from laboratory  studies  will include  computer  files of sequencing  data, and 
analyses.  These files will be stored on the Department of Medicine server.  Documentation  
linking patient identifiers  and patient  samples  results  will be securely  maintained in the secure  
Clinical  Research Database (CRDB)  with access  limited  to study  investigators.  
16.2 Quality Assurance 
 
Weekly  registration reports  will be generated to monitor  patient  accruals  and completeness  of 
registration  data. Routine  data quality  reports  will be generated to assess missing  data and 
inconsistencies. Accrual  rates  and extent  and accuracy  of evaluations  and follow-up will be 
monitored periodically  throughout the study  period and potential  problems  will be brought to 
the attention  of the study  team  for discussion and action.  
Random -sample  data quality  and protocol  compliance audits  will be conducted by [CONTACT_209870], at a minimum  of two times  per year,  more  frequently  if indicated.

16.3 Data  and Safety  Monitoring  
 
The Data and Safety  Monitoring (DSM)  Plans  at Memorial  Sloan -Kettering Cancer  Center  were  
approved by [CONTACT_40137]  2001.  The plans  address  the new policies  
set forth by [CONTACT_28643]  “Policy  of the National  Cancer  Institute  for Data and 
Safety  Monitoring of Clinical  Trials”  which can be found  at:  
http://cancertrials.nci.nih.gov/researchers/dsm/index.html . The DSM  Plans  at MSKCC  were  
established and are monitored by [CONTACT_30591].  The MSKCC  Data and Safety  
Monitoring Plans can be found  on the MSKCC Intranet at: http://mskweb2.mskcc. org/irb/index .htm 
 
There are several  different  mechanisms  by [CONTACT_30592], safety  and 
quality.  There are institutional  processes  in place for quality  assurance (e.g.,  protocol  monitoring,  
compliance  and data verification  audits,  therapeutic  response, and staff education on clinical  
research QA) and departmental  procedures  for quality  control,  plus there are two institutional  
committees  that are responsible for monitoring  the activities  of our clinical  trials programs.  The 
committees:  Data and Safety  Monitoring  Committee (DSMC)  for Phase I and II clinical trials, and 
the Data and Safety  Monitoring Board  (DSMB)  for Phase  III clinical  trials, report to the Center’s  
Research Council  and Institutional   Review  Board.  
 
During  the protocol  development and review  process, each protocol  will be assessed  for its level of 
risk and degree  of monitoring required.  Every  type of protocol  (e.g.,  NIH sponsored,  in-house  
sponsored,  industrial  sponsored,  NCI cooperative  group,  etc.) Will be addressed and the monitoring  
procedures  will be established  at the time of protocol  activation.  
 
17.[ADDRESS_250850] the study  participant.  
The financial  costs of the study  will be discussed;  pembrolizumab will be provided  free of charge.  
Biopsy  cost may be covered by [CONTACT_102]’s  insurance if it is required  for confirmation of metastatic  
disease, if not covered will be covered by [CONTACT_209871]. The patient will be responsible  for the cost 
of standard medical  care and all hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602],  even for complications  of treatment.  
 
No incentives  will be offered  to patients/subjects  to participate  in this study.  
 
17.2 Privacy  
 
MSK’s Privacy  Office may allow  the use and disclosure of protected  health  information  
pursuant  to a completed  and signed Research Authorization form. The use and disclosure of 
protected health information will be limited  to the individuals described in the Research  
Authorization  form. A Research Authorization form must  be completed by [CONTACT_11097]  [INVESTIGATOR_209836]  (IRB/PB).  
17.3 Serious Adverse Even t (SAE) Reporting 
 
An adverse  event  is considered serious  if it results  in ANY of the following outcomes:  
• Death 
• A life-threatening adverse event

Study Population:  
FLT3-mutated subjects with relapsed or refractory AML after first -line therapy. 
Number of Subjects to be Enrolled /Randomized:  
369 subjects will be randomized  
Study Design Overview:  
This is a phase 3, open -label, multicenter, randomized study to compare the efficacy and safety of 
ASP2215 therapy to salvage chemotherapy in FLT3-mutated AML subjects who are refractory to or 
have relapsed after first -line AML therapy.  
Three hundred sixty nine subjects will be randomized in a 2:[ADDRESS_735615]; options will include low -dose cytarabine (LoDAC), azacitidine, mitoxantrone, etoposide and 
intermediate -dose cytarabine (MEC) or fludarabine, cytarabine and granulocyte colony -stimulating 
factor with idarubicin (FLAG -IDA). The randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_372122] -line 
therapy and preselected salvage chemotherapy. Subjects will be administered treat ment over 
continuous [ADDRESS_735616] 
meets a treatment discontinuation criterion.  
Subjects receiving MEC or FLAG -IDA will receive 1  cycle of therapy and will be assessed for 
response on or after day 15 per institutional guidelines. If the bone marrow cellularity is 20% or 
greater with at least a 50% reduction in blasts, the subject may receive a second cycle of the same 
chemotherapy. If bone marrow cellularity is between 5% and 20%, the investigator should make the 
decision whether a subject should receive another treatment cycle or be observed for recovery. If bone 
marrow cellularity is 5% or less, the subject will be observed for rec overy. Subjects achieving CR, 
complete remission with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi) or complete remission with 
incomplete platelet recovery (CRp) may receive a second cycle of chemotherapy at the

investigator’s discretion. Subject with no response (NR) or progressive disease will discontinue study 
treatment following cycle 1.  
Dose adjustments for ASP2215 are described in Section 5.1.[ADDRESS_735618] a donor identified and achieve a response allowing them to undergo hematopoietic 
stem cell transplant (HSCT) per each institution’s assessment can undergo HSCT without leaving the 
study. However, ASP2215 should be stoppe d and a pre -HSCT visit should be performed prior to 
starting the conditioning regimen for HSCT. ASP2215 can be resumed after stem cell transplantation 
if the following conditions are met:  
• Subject is between [ADDRESS_735619]  
• Subject has had successful  engraftment as demonstrated by [CONTACT_28763] (ANC) 
≥ 500/mm3 and platelets ≥  [ZIP_CODE]/mm3 without transfusions  
• Subject does not have ≥  grade [ADDRESS_735620] disease (GVHD)  
• Subject is in CRc  
For subjects resuming treatment, subjects will  follow the procedures listed under subsequent cycles 
day [ADDRESS_735621]/end of treatment visit withi n [ADDRESS_735622] be repeated for resolution of treatment -related AEs. 
After which the subjects will enter the lo ng-term follow -up period for collection of patient reported 
outcome using EQ -5D-5L, subsequent AML treatment, remission status and survival (cause of death 
and date of death). The long -term follow -up will be as follows: every [ADDRESS_735623]’s end of treatment visit.  
Two interim analyses by [CONTACT_223233] (IDMC) will be conducted. The 
first interim analysis is planned when approximately [ADDRESS_735624] 112 days (4 treatment cycles) post first dose or randomization (for subjects who 
received no study drug). The first interim analysis will be performed to evaluate the efficacy endpoint 
of CR/CRh rate and the study conduct will not be impacted by [CONTACT_559814]/CRh rate.  
The second interim analy sis will be performed when approximately 50% of the planned total number 
of deaths (death events = 129 of planned 258 death events) by [CONTACT_559815]. . The second 
interim analysis will be utilized to determine whether the study should be terminat ed earlier than 
planned if ASP2215 has more favorable or harmful outcome than the salvage chemotherapy group. If 
the second interim analysis demonstrates a more favorable outcome for ASP2215 based on OS, 
enrollment to the study may be stopped. If it demons trates a harmful outcome, the enrollment will be 
stopped. However, any subject continuing to derive clinical benefit from ASP2215 as assessed by [CONTACT_559816]:  
• until the subject has met a treatment discontinuation criterion as outlined in Section 6  
• after ≥ [ADDRESS_735625] eted for all subjects*  
*At that point, subject(s) can be transitioned to commercial supply once ASP2215 achieves marketing 
authorization, commercial availability and applicable reimbursement in the country of residence. Once 
a subject(s) transition to com mercial supply, the subject(s) will be discontinued from the study.

Statistical Methods:  
Sample Size Justification:  
This is a group sequential design based co -primary endpoint of OS using the O’Brien -Fleming 
boundaries (non -binding) as implemented by [CONTACT_290941] -DeMets alpha/beta spending method (East®).   
The overall 0.025 one -sided type I error rate is allocate d by 0.0005 and 0.0245 (0.001 and 0.049 for 
two-sided type I error rate) for the two co -primary efficacy endpoints of CR/CRh and OS, 
respectively. The type I error (alpha) in the first interim analysis will not be recycled in the second 
interim analysis an d final analysis.  
The first interim analysis is planned when approximately [ADDRESS_735644] 112 days (4 treatment cycles) post first dose or randomization (for 
subjects who received no study drug). The second interi m analysis is planned when 
approximately [ADDRESS_735645] occurred. After the completion of the final (primary) analysis 
when approximately [ADDRESS_735646] occur red, additional data summary for subjects is planned 
when ≥ [ADDRESS_735647] been completed.   
OS:  
Approximately 369 subjects (the planned sample size with 10% dropout rate) will be randomized in a 
2:1 ratio to receive ASP2215 or salvage chemotherapy (246 subjects in the ASP2215 treatment arm 
and 123 subjects in the salvage chemotherapy arm). The planne d 258 death events will provide about 
90% power to detect a difference in OS between the ASP2215 arm with 7.7 months median survival 
time and salvage chemotherapy arm with 5  months median survival time (hazard  ratio = 0.65) at the 
overall 1-sided 0.0245 si gnificance level.  
CR/CRh rate:   
The first interim analysis will be conducted only to evaluate the co -primary endpoint of CR/CRh in 
ASP2215 arm only. One hundred and forty -one subjects randomized to ASP2215 arm (211 subjects in 
total: 141 in the ASP2215 arm  and 70 in the salvage chemothe rapy arm) with a minimum follow -up 
of 4 treatment cycles are considered to achieve a maxi mum width of 15.78% for the two -sided 95% 
exact confidence interval (CI) when the CR/CRh is expected to be in the 5% to 30% range as 
summarized in the table below. A sample size of 141 subjects provides 80% power to exclude a 
CR/CRh rate of 12% using the two -sided 95% exact CI when the CR/CRh rate of ASP2215 is 
assumed to be 21%.

EFS and CR rate:  
The planned sample size with 258 EFS events will provide about 90% power to detect the difference 
in EFS ([ADDRESS_735649] ratio  = 0.65) and > 90% power to detect a difference in CR rate between ASP2215 with 25% 
CR rate and the salvage chemotherapy with 10% CR rate at  the overall [ADDRESS_735650] -line AML therapy and preselected salvage 
chemotherapy:  
Response to first -line therapy:  
• Relapse within [ADDRESS_735651]  
• Relapse after [ADDRESS_735652]  
• Primary refractory without HSCT  
• Relapse within [ADDRESS_735653]  
• Relapse after [ADDRESS_735654]  
Preselected chemotherapy:  
• High intensity chemotherapy (FLAG -IDA or MEC)  
• Low intensity chemotherapy (LoDA C or azacitidine)  
Primary Efficacy Analysis:  
OS: 
The co-primary efficacy endpoint of OS will be analyzed using the stratified log -rank test with strata 
to control for response to first -line AML therapy and preselected salvage chemotherapy on the 
Intention to Treatment (ITT) Analysis Set . The ITT is defined as all randomized subjects and the 
analysis is based on the randomized treatment.  
The hypothesis testing  on the primary analysis of OS will be performed to test the null hypothesis that 
OS in the ASP221 5 arm is worse than or equal to OS in the salvage chemotherapy arm versus the 
alternative hypothesis that OS in the ASP2215 arm is better than OS in the salvage chemotherapy 
arm. 
The sensitivity analysis for the primary efficacy endpoint of OS will be perf ormed as follow s: 
• Same analysis as primary analysis , but on Full Analysis Set ( FAS), which included all 
randomized subjects who are FLT3 mutated subjects based on central test ; 
• Same analysis as primary analysis , but on PPS, which include all subjects in IT T and do not have 
any major PDs;  
• Stratified Cox proportional hazard model with strata to control for response to first -line AML 
therapy and preselected salvage chemotherapy on ITT;  
• Same analysis as primary analysis on ITT, but censoring the subjects who u ndergo HSCT at the 
time of HSCT;  
• To account for the possible confounding effect due to subsequent anti -leukemia therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], a 
sensitivity analysis of OS that censors subjects at the time of initiation of new therapy will be 
performed and an OS analysis that treats initiation of new therapy  as a time-dependent binary 
covariate will also be conducted.  
• Additional sensitivity analysis may be performed to compare the survival curves when the 
proportional hazards (PH) assumption is plausible.

Version 9.2 Incorporating Nonsubstantial Amendment 4   
CR/CRh rate: 
The two-sided 95% exact confidence interval of CR/CRh rate will be calculated for approximately  
[ADDRESS_735656] 112 days (4 treatment cycles) post 
first dose or randomization ( for subjects who received no study  drug), i.e., 2215 subjects in response 
analysis set (RAS). The lower limit will be used to compare with the benchmark of CR/CRh rate of 
12%.  
Sensitivity analyses will be performed to assess  the robustness of the CR/CRh rate based on:  
• Same population as f or the primary analysis, but only include subjects in modified response 
analysis set (mRAS);  
• Same population as for the primary analysis , but only include subjects who took at least one dose 
of ASP2215;  
• Same population as for the primary analysis , but only include subjects who had at least one post -
baseline bone marrow assessment;  
• Same population as for the primary analysis, but evaluate the CR/CRh by [CONTACT_5265] 4, which is 
defined as the number of subjects who achieve CR/CRh by [CONTACT_5265] 4 divided by [CONTACT_941] n umber of 
subjects in the analysis population.   
• Same population as for the primary analysis, but evaluate the CR/CRh prior to HSCT, which is 
defined as the number of subjects who achieve CR/CRh prior to HSCT divided by [CONTACT_559820].      
Key Secondary Efficacy Analysis:  
EFS: 
The key secondary efficacy endpoint of EFS will be analyzed using the stratified log -rank test with 
strata to control for response to fi rst-line AML therapy and preselected salvage chemotherapy on the 
ITT. To maintain the overall Type I error rate at the 0.0245 significance level, the hypothesis testing 
on EFS will be performed only if the null hypothesis on the primary analysis of OS is r ejected at its 
corresponding significance level at the second interim analysis and final analysis.  
The sensitivity analysis for the key secondary efficacy endpoint of EFS will be performed as follows:  
• Same analysis as primary analysis , but on FAS, which includes all randomized s ubjects who are 
FLT3 mutated subjects based on central test;  
• Same analysis as primary analysis , but on PPS, which includes all subjects in ITT and do not 
have any major PDs;  
• Stratified Cox proportional hazard mod el with strata to control for response to first -line AML 
therapy and preselected salvage chemotherapy on ITT;  
• EFS will be defined similarly as in Section [IP_ADDRESS], however the date of the first new anti -
leukemia therapy after end of study treatment or the last treatment evaluation (when new anti -
leukemia therapy date is not available) will be used as the event date of treatment failure;  
• EFS will be defined similarly as in Section [IP_ADDRESS], however subjects who discontinued the 
treatment due to “Lost to follow up” will also be consid ered as an EFS event and the subjects 
will be censored at t he date of “Lost to follow up”.

Version 9.2 Incorporating Nonsubstantial Amendment 4   
CR rate: 
The key secondary efficacy endpoint of CR rate will be tested using the Cochran -Mantel-Haenszel 
(CMH) test to control for response to first -line AML therapy and preselected salvage chemotherapy 
on the ITT. To maintain the overall Type I error rate at the 0 .0245 significance level, the hypothesis  
testing on CR rate will be performed only if the null hypothesis on EFS is rejected at its 
corresponding significance level at the second interim analysis and final analysis.   
Sensitivity analyses for CR rate will b e performed as follows:  
• CMH test on subjects in ITT and received at least one dose of study treatment  
• CMH test on subjects in ITT with at least one post -baseline bone marrow assessment  
• Un-stratified Fisher’s exact test on subjects in ITT  
Secondary Efficacy  Analyses:  
The statistical analyses on secondary efficacy endpoints include:  
• Stratified log -rank test on duration of remission and LFS  
• CMH method on the CRc rate and transplantation rate  
• Transfusion conversion rate and transfusion maintenance rate will be summarized by [CONTACT_84814] 
• Analysis of c ovariance (ANCOVA) model to analyze the change in the BFI global fatigue score 
(average of all 9 items) from baseline to post -baseline visits  
Safety Analyses:  
The Safety Analysis Set is defined as all subje cts who received at least 1 dose of study treatment 
(ASP2215 or salvage chemotherapy).  
The safety evaluation will be based mainly on AEs, clinical laboratory, vital signs, ECG, 
ophthalmologic assessments and ECOG.  Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize safety data.  
All safety data will be summarized by [CONTACT_3148].  
All summaries of AEs will include only treatment -emergent events unless otherwise stated. AEs will 
be categorized by [CONTACT_559821] t o the 
National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.03.  
Pharmacokinetics Analyses:  
Population pharmacokinetic modeling will be conducted for ASP2215 using nonlinear mixed effects 
methodology.  Data from this study may be pooled with other studies for analysis. A covariate 
analysis will be performed to relate the effect of intrinsic and extrinsic subject factors to exposure.

Version 9.2 Incorporating Nonsubstantial Amendment 4   
Exploratory Analyses:  
An exploratory analysis of FLT3 mutation status and clinical efficacy will be conducted.  FLT3 
mutation status, including subgroups of FLT3 internal tandem duplication mutation, D835/I836 
tyrosine kinase domain mutations and allelic ratio, will be analyzed.  
CMH method will be used f or resource utilization status (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], blood transfusion, antibiotic 
iv infusions, medication for AEs and opi[INVESTIGATOR_2536]); and ANCOVA model will be used for 
resource utilization counts (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7959], duration of medications, blood transfusio ns, antibiotic iv 
infusions, medication for AEs and opi[INVESTIGATOR_2536]).  
ANCOVA model will be used to analyze the change in the FACIT -Dys-SF domain scores from 
baseline to post -baseline visits.  
ANCOVA model will be used to evaluate change from baseline to post-baseline visits for the global 
and domain scores, individual items and item clusters of the FACT -Leu. The same analytic approach 
will be used for the dizziness and mouth sore items.  
ANCOVA model will be used for the change from baseline of EQ -5D-5L visual analogue scale and 
shift table for the 5  dimensions (mobility, self -care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and 
anxiety/depression) baseline to post -baseline visits.  
Interim Analysis:  
To evaluate whether ASP2215 is particularly beneficial or harmful compared to the benchmark data 
or the salvage chemotherapy group while the study is ongoing, two interim analyses are planned.  
First Interim Analysis  
The first interim analysis is planned when approximately [ADDRESS_735659] 112 days (4 treatment cycles) post first dose or randomization (for subjects 
who received no study drug).  At the first interim  analysis, only the co -primary endpoint of CR/CRh 
rate will be evaluated in the ASP2215 arm only. The descriptive sta tistics including two -sided 95% 
exact CI of CR/CRh rate will be provided to IDMC. The historical control of the CR/CRh rate is 
considered to be 12%. The IDMC will evaluate the CR/CRh rate and inform the Sponsor if the lower 
limit is higher than the histori cal control or not. The study conduct will not be impacted by [CONTACT_559822].  
A nominal 1 -sided p-value 0.0005 (i.e., 2 -sided p-value 0.001), which is arbitrarily selected, will be 
spent to acknowledge the single -arm CR/CRh rate evaluation at the first interim analysis and will not 
be recycled in the second interim analysis and final analysis. No formal hypothesis testing will be 
conducted for CR/CRh rate for the study, only the descriptive statistics including 2 -sided 95% exact 
CI of CR/CRh rate will be provided to IDMC at the first interim. The hypothesis testing for the 
primary and secondary endpoints of OS, EFS and CR rate at the secondary interim analysis and final 
analysis are well controlled at an overall 1 -sided type I erro r rate 0.0245 based on a sequential testing 
procedure.  
Second Interim Analysis  
The second interim analysis will be performed when approximately 50% of the total planned death 
events (death events = 129) have occurred in the study. OS will be tested at 1 -sided 0.[ZIP_CODE]/0.[ZIP_CODE] 
significant level for efficacy/futility according to the O’Brien -Fleming type alpha/beta spending 
function.  
The IDMC may recommend terminating the trial for favorable or unfavorable results at the second 
interim analysis based on OS en dpoint. In the case of favorable results (i.e., the 1 -sided P-value is less 
than 0.[ZIP_CODE]), the IDMC may recommend terminating the trial for success. In the case of unfavorable 
results (i.e., the 1 -sided P-value is greater than 0.[ZIP_CODE]), the IDMC may recomm end terminating the 
trial for futility.

e. Screening ECG i s required. ECG assessment will be evaluated at predose of cycle 1 day 1, cycle 1 day 8, cycle 1 day 15 and day 1 of each sub sequent cycle. Predose 
assessments should be taken within 1 hour before drug administration. The 12 -lead ECGs will be recorded in t riplicate ([ADDRESS_735664] 5 minutes apart per time point) and transmitted electronically for central reading. The mean QTcF of the triplic ate ECG tracings based on central reading will be 
used for final t reatment decisions and AE reporting. If the mean of the triplicate QTcF is > 500 ms at any time point (by [CONTACT_559823]), then triplicate ECGs will be repeated (within 2 hours if based on value on ECG tracing print out and as soon as possible if based on central reading). If the repeat 
ECG confirms a mean of the triplicate QTcF >  500 ms, dosing of ASP2215 will be interrupted for up to 14 days. While ASP2215 may be interrupted temporarily based on 
value on ECG tracing  printout, the central reading should be used for final treatment decisions. Cardiology consult will be obtained as medically indicated. If QTcF resolves to 
≤ 480 ms (grade 1 or less) by [CONTACT_559824] [ADDRESS_735665] also be submitted for central read. Labs and/or ECG can be repeated during screening

Version 9.2 Incorporating Nonsubstantial Amendment 4  1 INTRODUCTION  
1.1 Background  
Over 90% of leukemia cases are diagnosed in adults [ADDRESS_735687] common types are chronic lymphocytic leukemia (35%) and acute myeloid 
leukemia (AML) (32%) [ American Cancer Society, 2014].  The median age at diagnosis is 
67 years of age, with 54% of pati ents diagnosed at 65 years or older [ O’Donnell  et al, 2012].  
It was estimated that [ZIP_CODE] people ([ZIP_CODE] men and 7330  women) were to be diagnosed with 
AML, and [ZIP_CODE] were to die from the disease in 2014 in the [LOCATION_002] [American Cancer 
Society, 2014].  While 60% to 80% of younger patients achieve a complete remission (CR) 
with standard therapy, only about 30% to 40% of the overall patient population has long -term 
disease-free survival [ Tallman, 2005].  Outcomes are worse for patients aged 60 years or ov er, 
with CR rates in the range of 40% to 55% and poor long -term survival rates.  
Along with  age, remission rates and overall survival ( OS) depend on a number of other factors, 
including  cytogenetics,  previous bone marrow disorders (such as myelodysplastic syndrome 
[MDS]) and comorbidities.  Currently,  there is no effective  cure for the disease. 
FMS-like tyrosine kinase (FLT3) is a member of the class III receptor tyrosine kinase (TK) 
family that is normally expressed on the surface of hematopoietic progenitor cells.  FLT3 and 
its ligand play an important role in proliferation, survival and differentiation of multipotent 
stem cells. FLT3 is overexpressed in the majority of AML cases. In addition, activated FLT3 
with internal tandem duplication (ITD) i n and around the juxtamembrane domain and 
tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) mutations at around D835 in the activation loop are present in 
28% to 34% and 11% to 14% of AML cases, respectively  [Schlenk & Döhner, 2009].  These 
activated mutations in FLT3 are onco genic and show transforming activity in cells 
[Yamamoto et al, 2001].  Patients with FLT3 -ITD mutation show poor prognosis in clinical 
studies, with a higher relapse rate, a shorter duration of remission from initial therapy 
(6 months versus 11.5 months fo r those without FLT3 -ITD mutations) as well as reduced 
disease-free survival (16% to 27% versus 41% at 5  years) and OS (15% to 31% versus 42% 
at 5 years) [ Patel et al, 2012; Gale et al, 2008; Yanada et al, 2005; Tiesmeier et al, 2004; 
Moreno et al, 2003].  The incidence of relapse after hematopoietic stem cell transplant 
(HSCT) is also higher for patients with FLT3 -ITD (30% versus 16% at 2 years for those 
without FLT3 -ITD mutations) [ Brunet et al, 2012]. Similar to their prognosis for first -line 
therapy, pa tients with relapsed/refractory FLT3 -mutation positive AML have lower remission 
rates with salvage chemotherapy, shorter durations of remission to second relapse and 
decreased OS relative to FLT3 -mutation negative patients [ Konig & Levis, 2015; Chevallier 
et al, 2011; Levis et al, 2011].  In a recent international randomized phase III study of 
elacytarabine versus investigator choice in patients with relapsed/refractory acute myeloid 
leukemia, the CR rate in the control arm was only 12% [ Roboz et al, 2014] .  In this study, the 
treatment options available in the control arm (physician’s choice) reflect contemporary 
clinical practice, rather than a strict selection of only patients that are eligible for intensive 
salvage regimens.  As a result, this control ar m should more appropriately represent what can 
be expected in standard clinical practice.

Version 9.2 Incorporating Nonsubstantial Amendment 4  AXL tyrosine kinase (AXL) is  a member of TAM f amily (Tyro-3, AXL and  Mer) receptor  
TKs and is normally expressed  in cells of mesenchymal origin, such as osteoblasts,  fibroblasts 
and blood  cells. AXL has been  reported to be overexpressed  or activated  in many cancers, 
including  AML [Linger et al, 2008].  AXL overexpression  in AML confers drug resistance  
[Hong et al, 2008] and  is associated  with adverse prognosis [Ben-Batalla et al,  2013; Rochlitz  
et al, 1999]. AXL inhibition  suppresses the  growth of hu man FLT3-positive AML in vivo 
[Park et al, 2013].  In addition, AXL inhib ition is also effective against FLT3 -negative AML 
expressing AXL  in vivo [Ben-Batalla et al,  2013]. 
ASP2215 is a new chemical entity discovered by [CONTACT_559830]. in collaboration with 
Kotobuki Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.  ASP2215 has an inhibitory effect on TKs, mainly FLT3, 
AXL and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK). ASP2215 demonstrated favora ble efficacy in a 
nonclinical AML model, with complete regression of tumors in the xenograft model mice 
transplanted with MV4 -11, human AML cell line expressing FLT3 -ITD, by [CONTACT_559831].  In addition, ASP2215 inhibited the growth of cells expressin g either FLT3 -ITD, 
FLT3-D835Y or FLT3 -ITD-D835Y. 
There is no universally accepted standard chemotherapy regimen for patients with relapsed or 
refractory AML and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guideline for 
AML strongly recommends clinical  trial as the first option for any patient.  The guidelines 
also provide a list of commonly used regimens for relapsed/refractory AML. The choice of 
specific regimen is based on factors such as prior treatment, eligibility for allogeneic HSCT 
and instituti onal preference. Additionally, there are no definitive studies that demonstrated 
superiority of any single regimen. In this study, a limited list of regimens listed in NCCN 
guidelines are provided as comparator chemotherapy regimens  for the investigators t o choose 
from. Similar to the guidelines, both aggressive ( mitoxantrone, etoposide and 
intermediate -dose cytarabine [MEC]  and fludarabine, cytarabine and granulocyte 
colony-stimulating factor with idarubicin [FLAG -IDA]) and less -aggressive ( low-dose 
cytarabine [LoDAC]  and azacitidine) regimens are included in the study.  
1.2 Nonclinical and Clinical Data  
1.2.1 Nonclinical Data  
ASP2215 inhibited activities of FLT3, nucleophosmin -1 gene-ALK, leukocyte receptor TK, 
ALK and AXL kinases at 1 and 5  nmol/L and tropomyosin re ceptor kinase  A, ROS, RET and 
MER kinases at 5  nmol/L by [CONTACT_46431] 50%. ASP2215 inhibited FLT3, echinoderm 
microtubule -associated protein -like 4-ALK variant 1 and KIT kinase activities with the half 
maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50) values of 0.291, 1.2 a nd 229 nmol/L, respectively.  
ASP2215 inhibited each radioligand binding to adenosine A1 receptor (rat), serotonin 
5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 1 (5HT 1R) (nonselective, rat), serotonin 5 -hydroxytryptamine 
receptor 2B (5HT 2BR) (human) and sigma receptor (non selective, guinea pig) with IC 50 
values of 4.57, 4.90, 0.190 and 0.615  μmol/L, respectively.

Version 9.2 Incorporating Nonsubstantial Amendment 4  ASP2215 inhibited human 5HT 2BR function in a cell function assay with an IC 50 value of 
5.82 μmol/L without showing agonistic activity.  
ASP2215 inhibited the cell g rowth of Ba/F3 cells expressing FLT3 -ITD, FLT3 -D835Y and 
FLT3-ITD-D835Y with IC 50 values of 1.8, 1.6 and 2.1  nmol/L, respectively. ASP2215 
inhibited the growth of MV4 -11 cells with IC 50 value of 0.92  nmol/L. In MV4 -11 cells, 
treatment of ASP2215 at 0, 0.1, 1 and 10  nmol/L resulted in FLT3 phosphorylation of 100%, 
86%, 19% and 7%, respectively.   
ASP2215 induced significant growth inhibition of MV4 -11 tumors and tumor regression in 
vivo.  Further, ASP2215 at 6 and 10  mg/kg per day induced complete tumor regression for 
[ADDRESS_735690] 
KIT kinase, and neutropenia was not observed in the toxicity studies in rats and dogs.  
In Caco-2 cells, the permeability of ASP2215 was between that of known low and high 
permeability markers. ASP2215 was a substrate for P -glycoprotein (P -gp), but not a substrate 
for breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), organic anion transporting polypeptide 
(OATP)1B1, OATP1B3 or organic cation transporter 1. ASP2215 demonstrated a potential to 
inhibit BCRP and multidrug and toxin extrusion protein 1 (MATE1) at clinically relevant 
concentrations of ASP2215. However, preliminary results from the drug -drug intera ction 
assessment of coadministration of ASP2215 and cephalexin, a MATE1 substrate, in 
Relapse/Refractory AML subjects indicate lack of a clinically -significant interaction between 
ASP2215 and MATE1 substrates (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]).  
No major human -specific ASP2215 metabolites were formed by [CONTACT_559832]. The main enzyme involved in the metabolism of ASP2215 was estimated to be 
cytochrome P450 (CYP )3A4.  ASP2215 has a potential to induce CYP enzyme activities 
(CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4/5) and messenger RNA 
levels (CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9 and CYP3A4).  However, these results should be 
interpreted with caution because these eff ects were not uniformly observed in all donor 
samples and the concentration -dependency of these effects could not be evaluated.  
For CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9 and CYP2D6 inhibition, IC 50 values were  
> 100 μmol/L. Very weak direct inhibition of CYP2C1 [ADDRESS_735691] inhibition of CYP enzymes at clinically relevant 
concentrations.

Version 9.2 Incorporating Nonsubstantial Amendment 4  1.2.2 Clinical Data  
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics  
The pharmacokinetic parameters of unchanged drug after single and  multiple dosing of 
ASP2215 to AML subjects were investigated in the dose escalation cohort of 
Study 2215-CL-0101. Assessment of observed trough concentration (C trough) over time for 
individual subjects (both dose escalation and dose expansion cohorts) sho wed that in most 
subjects, the trough concentration of ASP2215 appeared to reach steady state by [CONTACT_4475] 15 of 
multiple administrations of ASP2215 from 20 to 120  mg once daily. Plasma inhibitory assay 
(PIA) from the samples collected predose and postdose on da ys 1, 8, [ADDRESS_735693] of strong and moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors and strong CYP3A4 inducers on 
ASP2215 exposure was assessed in Relapse/Refractory AML subjects (Study 2215 -CL-0101) 
and healthy subjects (Study 2215 -CL-0108). In Relapse/Refractory AML subjects, there was 
a less than 2 -fold increase in ASP2215 exposure when ASP2215 was coadministered with 
moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors. In healthy subjects, ASP2215 exposur e increased 
approximately 2 -fold when ASP2215 was coadministered with itraconazole, a strong 
CYP3A4 and P -gp inhibitor. Coadministration of ASP2215 with rifampi[INVESTIGATOR_2513], a strong 
CYP3A4 inducer, resulted in an approximate 70% decrease in ASP2215 exposure. 
Collectively, these data support monitoring subjects who require concomitant medications 
that are strong CYP3A4 inhibitors and restricting use of concomitant medications that are 
strong CYP3A4 inducers.  
Preliminary results from a drug -drug interaction assessment in a subset of Relapse/Refractory 
AML subjects (2215 -CL-0101) indicate cephalexin (MATE 1 substrate) exposure was 
comparable after single dose administration of cephalexin alone and in combination with 
ASP2215 (administered once daily). These re sults suggest coadministration of MATE1 
substrates and ASP2215 is not expected to result in a clinically -relevant drug -drug 
interaction.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Efficacy  
In Study 2215-CL-0101, as of 02 Feb 2015, 154  subjects were evaluable for response. The 
response asse ssments were done based on central laboratory evaluation of samples 
supplemented with local results when the central results were not available (derived response).  
Based on the derived response at end of treatment in the 154 subjects (both FLT3 -mutation 
positive and negative) who received at least 1  dose of ASP2215, 41 (26.6%) subjects achieved 
composite complete remission  (CRc), and the best overall response rate  
(CRc + partial remission [PR]) was 35.7%.  
Nearly all subjects that achieved a derived respons e of PR or CRc at the end of treatment were 
FLT3-mutation positive. Based on the derived response in the 98 FLT3 -mutation positive 
subjects at the end of treatment, 36 (36.7%) subjects achieved CRc, and the best overall 
response rate was 49.0%. Five (5.1%)  subjects achieved CR , 3 (3.1%) subjects achieved 
complete remission  with incomplete platelet recovery (CRp), 28  (28.6%) subjects achieved

achieved PR . 
CRc rates for 80, 120 and 200  mg dose groups were 41.7%, 48.6% and 45.8% respectively. 
Among the 77 FLT3 -mutation positive subjects in the 80  mg, 120 mg, 200 mg, 300 mg and 
450 mg dose groups, 34 (44.2%) had achieved CRc as the derived response at the end of 
treatment and t he overall response rate was 55.8%. Four (5.2%) subjects achieved CR, 
3 (3.9%) subjects achieved CRp, 27 (35.1%) subjects achieved CRi and 9  (11.7%) subjects 
achieved PR.  
Based on the derived response in the 47 FLT3 -mutation negative subjects at the end of  
treatment, 2 (4.3%) subjects achieved CRc, and the best overall response rate (CRc  + PR) 
was 8.5%. Two (4.3%) subjects each achieved CRi and PR.  
1.3 Summary of Key Safety Information for Study Drugs  
1.3.1 ASP2215  
The nonclinical and clinical studies which are refer red to in this section are described in more 
detail in the ASP2215 Investigator’s Brochure [2015] . 
[IP_ADDRESS] ASP2215 Nonclinical Data  
ASP2215 showed a concentration -dependent suppression effect on the human ether -a-go-go 
related gene current in HEK293 cells at conce ntrations of 3  × 10-6, 1 × 10-5 and 
3 × 10-5 mol/L with compensated suppression rates of 18.1%, 32.8% and 70.7%, respectively; 
no suppression was observed at 1 × 10-6 mol/L. The IC 50 was 1.6 × 10-5 mol/L. 
ASP2215 showed no effects on the central nervous sy stem in rats at 10  mg/kg.  At 30  mg/kg 
and higher, decreased urination was noted.  In addition, at 100  mg/kg, decreased defecation 
was noted.  The changes in urination and defecation were resolved in the recovery period.  
ASP2215 did not show any effect on the cardiovascular or respi[INVESTIGATOR_559792] 
100 mg/kg or on the central nervous system at 1  mg/kg. At 3  mg/kg and higher, the following 
signs were noted: retching at 3  mg/kg, vomiting and positive fecal occult blood at 10  mg/kg 
and higher, a dec rease in the blood calcium (Ca2+) concentration at 30  mg/kg and salivation 
and an increase followed by a decrease in the blood Ca2+ concentration at 100  mg/kg. All of 
the findings recovered.  
In the single oral dose toxicity study in rats, the approximate lethal dose level was 300  mg/kg 
for males and females. The major change was a gastrointestinal hemorrhagic disorder at 
100 and 300 mg/kg. Reversibility of the changes noted in the surviving animals was seen.  
No definitive single oral dose toxicity study i n dogs was conducted.  In the 4 -week toxicity 
study in dogs, a dose of 1000  mg/kg per day caused deaths and moribund sacrifices on day 2.  
The cause of death and moribundity was considered to be deterioration of general condition 
caused by [CONTACT_559833].  
In the 1-week oral repeated dose toxicity study in rats, interstitial pneumonia in the lung and 
vacuolar change in the rod -cone layer of the retina were observed in a male at 30  mg/kg per

Version 9.2 Incorporating Nonsubstantial Amendment 4  day.  In the 13 -week oral repeated dose toxicity study in rats, deaths occurred at 20  mg/kg per 
day in both sexes. Target organ toxicity was identified in the gastrointestinal tract, immune 
system, hematopoietic system, eye, lung, kidney and liver. The no observed adverse effect 
level (NOAEL) was lower than 2. 5 mg/kg per day for males and females. The changes noted 
during the dosing period recovered or tended to recover during the 4 -week recovery period.  
In the 4-week oral repeated dose study in dogs, mortality occurred at 10  mg/kg per day or 
more. Target orga n toxicity was identified in the gastrointestinal tract, immune system, 
hematopoietic system, eye, kidney and liver. The NOAEL was 1  mg/kg per day for males and 
females. Reversibility of most of the test article related changes was indicated by [CONTACT_255141] 4-week recovery period. In the 13 -week oral repeated dose study in dogs, mortality 
occurred at 5  mg/kg per day. Target organ toxicity was identified in the lung, lacrimal gland, 
urinary bladder, epi[INVESTIGATOR_255125], gastrointestinal tract, immune system,  hematopoietic 
system, eye, kidney and liver. The NOAEL was 1  mg/kg per day for males and females.  
Reversibility of most of the test article -related changes was indicated by [CONTACT_2671] 
4-week recovery period.  
ASP2215 did not induce gene mutation in th e definitive in vitro reversion test in bacteria.  
Similarly, ASP2215 did not induce chromosomal aberrations in the definitive in vitro 
chromosomal aberration test in mammalian cells. The definitive in vivo micronucleus test 
showed that ASP2215 has a poten tial to induce micronuclei in mice. Based on the results of 
the battery of genotoxicity studies above, it was concluded that ASP2215 has a potential to 
induce genotoxicity in vivo.  
ASP2215 showed teratogenic potential and embryo -fetal deaths in the embryo -fetal 
development study in rats. The NOAEL of ASP2215 for dams and embryo -fetal development 
was 10 mg/kg per day.  
ASP2215 showed no potential to induce phototoxicity to cultured mammalian cells.  
[IP_ADDRESS] ASP2215 Clinical Data

A preliminary analysis of the relationship between ASP2215 plasma concentration and 
Fridericia -corrected QT interval (QTcF) change from baseline (ΔQTcF) was performed o n data 
from the 2215 -CL-0101 study (data cutoff [ADDRESS_735700] 2015). This assessment included [ADDRESS_735701] the ASP2215 concentration -ΔQTcF relationship.  A 
concentration -related increase in ΔQTcF was observed and the mean ΔQTcF at the mean 
steady-state C max was predicted to be less than the 10 msec threshold considered clinically 
significant. Additionally, less than 5% of Relapsed/Refractory AML subjects h ad a maximum 
post-baseline QTcF interval > 500 msec. These data indicate clinically -relevant QTc 
prolongation is not anticipated.  
An exposure -related increase in circulating creatine kinase (CK) concentration relative to 
baseline was also observed in Rela pse/Refractory AML subjects enrolled in Study 
2215-CL-0101. Almost all CK elevations were grade 1 and grade 2, however, Common

related to elevated CK occurred in higher ASP2 215 dose groups. Similarly, a significant 
correlation between ASP2215 concentration and aspartate aminotransferase change from 
baseline (ΔAST) was also observed. However, the incidence of ≥ Grade [ADDRESS_735703] was < 3% (data cutoff 31 Oc t 2015). 
As of [ADDRESS_735704] 2015, 23 subjects experienced a dose limiting toxicity (DLT). All DLTs occurred 
in the dose expansion cohort, with the exception of [ADDRESS_735705] and grade 3 dia rrhea. No further subjects will 
be enrolled in the 450  mg dose group. None of the doses below 450  mg met the criteria for 
pausing enrollment. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in Study 2215 -CL-0101 is 
considered 300  mg. 
Expected adverse drug reactions for A SP2215 include (by [CONTACT_11702]) diarrhea, peripheral 
edema, increased blood creatine phosphokinase, increased ALT, increased AST and myopathy.

1.4 Risk-Benefit Assessment  
Approximately 30% of adult AML subjects are refractory to induction therapy. Furthermore, 
of those who achieve CR, approximately 75% will relapse. Subjects with AML with FLT3 
mutations comprise an especially poor prognosis group. Generally, there is no established 
standard for relapsed subjects with FLT3 mutations and less than 20% will achieve CR w ith 
subsequent treatment. Duration of remission for the small minority who achieve remission is 
also limited with most of the subjects relapsing.  
In phase 1/2 Study 2215 -CL-0101, ASP2215 has resulted in CRc in over 40% of subjects 
receiving [ADDRESS_735707] a very poor 
prognosis. Although there are various chemotherapy options available, they are by [CONTACT_559836]. The response to salvage chemotherapy is poor, and especially for subjects with 
FLT3 mutation. Although it is not known whether response to ASP2215 treatment would 
lead to longer survival, in light of the very poor prognosis of relapsed or refractory AML 
subjects with FLT3 mutations, the potential for ASP2215 to improve outcome outweig hs the 
risk of potential toxicities.

Three hundred sixty nine subjects will be randomized. The randomization of the 369  subjects 
will be in a 2:[ADDRESS_735711]; options will 
include LoDAC, azacitidine, MEC or FLAG -IDA. The random ization will be stratified by

administered treatment over continuous [ADDRESS_735712] meets a treatment discontinuation criterion.  
Subjects receiving MEC or FLAG -IDA will receive 1 cycle of therapy and will be assessed 
for response on or after day 15 per institutional guidelines. If the bone marro w cellularity is 
20% or greater with at least a 50% reduction in blasts, the subject may receive a second cycle 
of the same chemotherapy. If bone marrow cellularity is between 5% and 20%, the 
investigator should make the decision whether the subject should  receive another treatment 
cycle or be observed for recovery. If bone marrow cellularity is 5% or less, the subject will be 
observed for recovery. Subjects achieving CR, CRi or CRp may receive a second cycle of 
chemotherapy at the investigator’s discretion . Subjects with no response (NR) or progressive 
disease following cycle 1 will discontinue study treatment.  
Dose adjustments for ASP2215 are described in [Section 5.1.2] of the protocol.  
Subjects who have a donor identified and achieve a response allowing them to undergo 
HSCT per each institution’s assessment can undergo HSCT without leaving the study.  
However, ASP2215 should be stopped and a pre -HSCT visit should be performed prior to 
Sponsor: APGD  ISN/Protocol [ADDRESS_735713]. ASP2215 can be resumed after stem cell 
transplantation if the following conditions are met:  
● Subject is between [ADDRESS_735714]  
● Subject has had successful engraftment as  demonstrated by [CONTACT_28763] 
(ANC) ≥ 500/mm3 and platelets ≥ [ZIP_CODE]/mm3 without transfusions  
● Subject does not have ≥ grade [ADDRESS_735715] disease (GVHD)  
● Subject is in CRc  
For subjects resuming treatment, subjects will follow the procedures listed under subsequent 
cycles day [ADDRESS_735716]/end of treatment visit within 
[ADDRESS_735717] be repeated for resolution of 
treatment -related AEs. After which the subjects will enter the long -term follow -up period for 
collection of patient reported outcome (PRO) using EQ -5D-5L, subsequent AML treatment, 
remission status and survival (cause of death and date of death). The long-term follow -up will 
be as follows: every [ADDRESS_735718]’s end of treatment visit . 
Two interim analyses by [CONTACT_223233] (IDMC) will be 
conducted. The first interim analysis is planned when approximately [ADDRESS_735719] 112 days (4 treatment cycles) post first dose 
or randomization (for subjects who received no study drug). The first interim analysis will be 
performed to evaluate the efficacy endpoint of CR/CRh and the study c onduct will not be 
impacted by [CONTACT_559814]/CRh  rate. 
The second interim analysis will be performed when approximately 50% of the planned total 
number of deaths (death event = 129 of planned 258 death events) by [CONTACT_559838]. The second interim analysis will be utilized to determine whether the study should 
be terminated earlier than planned if ASP2215 has more favorable or harmful outcome than 
the salvage chemotherapy group. If the second interim analysis demonstrates a more 
favorable ou tcome for ASP2215 based on OS, enrollment to the study may be stopped. If it 
demonstrates a harmful outcome, the enrollment will be stopped. However, any subject 
continuing to derive clinical benefit from ASP2215, as assessed by [CONTACT_093], will be 
allowed to continue the assigned study treatment if one or more of the following conditions 
have been met : 
● until the subject has met a treatment discontinuation criterion as outlined in Section  6;  
● after ≥ [ADDRESS_735720] been completed for all subjects*  
*At that point, subject(s) can be transitioned to commercial supply once ASP2215 achieves marketing 
authorization, commercial availability and applicable reimbursement in the country of residence. Once a 
subject(s) transitions to commercial supply, the sub ject(s) will be discontinued from the study.

Version 9.2 Incorporating Nonsubstantial Amendment 4  2.2.2 Dose Rationale  
[IP_ADDRESS] ASP2215  
In the first -in-human phase 1/2 clinical Study 2215 -CL-0101, relapsed/refractory AML 
subjects were treated with ASP2215 at doses ranging from 20 to 450  mg administered once 
daily. The prim ary objectives for this study were to determine the safety and 
pharmacokinetics of ASP2215 following single and repeat dosing. In addition, preliminary 
efficacy as assessed by [CONTACT_559839].  
Clinical safety data indicated an MTD of 300  mg.  Clinical efficacy data supports doses of 
120 mg and greater to ensure efficacy in FLT3 -mutation positive subjects.  PIA has shown 
substantial reduction of phospho -FLT3, with > 90% inhibition at doses of [ADDRESS_735722] reached the threshold to 
stop enrollment (> 20% DLT with posterior probability of 80%), [ADDRESS_735723] elevations correlating with increasing 
dose and increasing ex posure were observed. Overall, 120  mg provides a good balance of 
ensuring effective drug levels for virtually all subjects with a low incidence of safety 
concerns, while still preserving the 200  mg dose available for dose escalation.

Doses of chemotherapy regimens were taken from representative publications as listed in 
Section [IP_ADDRESS].  Doses used in randomized trials  were chosen where available.

Subjects receiving LoDAC or azacitidine treatment should continue until the subject meets a 
treatment discontinuation criterion.  
Subjects receiving MEC or FLAG -IDA will receive 1 cycle of t herapy and will be assessed 
for response on or after day 15  per institutional guidelines. If the bone marrow cellularity is 
20% or greater with at least a 50% reduction in blasts, the subject may receive a second cycle 
of the same chemotherapy. If bone marrow cellularity is between 5% and 20%, the 
investigator should make the decision whether the subject should receive another treatment 
cycle or be observed for recovery. If bone marrow cellularity is 5% or less, the subject will be 
observed for recovery. Su bjects achieving CR, CRi or CRp may receive a second cycle of 
chemotherapy at the investigator’s discretion. Subjects with NR or progressive disease 
following cycle [ADDRESS_735748] udy Drug  
Guidelines for ASP2215 dose interruption and reduction are provided in [ Table 6]. 
The ASP2215 dose may be initially reduced to [ADDRESS_735749] has already experienced clinical benefit. Note 
that dose reductions should occur in a step -wise manner. Dose reduction can occur during the 
treatment cycle based on the dose reduction  guideline in [ Table 6]. No further dose reductions 
are allowed (i.e., if a subject is receiving ASP2215 40  mg and further dose reduction is 
required, study treatment will be discontinued).  
Additionally, if the investigator deems it necessary to ensure subject safety, dosing may be 
interrupted or reduced for reasons other than those provided in [ Table 6]. In the unusual 
circumstance that dosing is interrupted or reduced for reasons not specified in the tables, the 
investigator should promptly inform the study medical monitor or his/her designee.  
Any subjects that have been off treatment for more than [ADDRESS_735750] can only 
resume treatment after discussion with the medical monitor.  
If the ASP2215 dose has been reduced, the ASP2215 dose will not be re -escalated.

Event Action 
QTc Prolongation  
QTcF > 500 ms If the mean of the triplicate QTcF is > 500 ms at any time point (by [CONTACT_559848]), then triplicate ECGs will be 
repeated (within 2 hours if based on value on ECG tracing printout and as soon 
as possible if based on central reading). If the repeat ECG confirms a mean of 
the triplicate QTcF > 500 ms, dosing of ASP2215 wil l be interrupted for up to 
14 days. While ASP2215 may be interrupted temporarily based on value on 
ECG tracing printout, the central reading should be used for final treatment 
decisions. Cardiology consult will be obtained as medically indicated. If QTcF

increased >  30 ms bas ed on central read ECG without any other etiology, a 
confirmatory ECG will be performed on day 9. If the cycle 1 day 9 central read 
ECG is confirmatory, a dose reduction should be considered. QTcF values 
based on central reading from triplicate ECGs should  be used for this 
determination (i.e., day 8 mean QTcF from triplicate ECGs at predose minus 
the day 1 mean QTcF from triplicate ECGs at predose).

5.1.3 Previous and Concomitant Treatment (Medication and Nonmedication Therapy)  
All medications and concomitant treatments administered from [ADDRESS_735757] be recorded in the Case Report Form (CRF). Concomitant medications should be 
collected for reported AE/ serious adverse events ( SAEs) through [ADDRESS_735758], concomitant medications should b e 
collected for reported AE/SAEs through start of conditioning treatment or [ADDRESS_735759].  
[IP_ADDRESS] ASP2215 Group Only  
Treatment with concomitant drugs that are strong inducers of CYP3A are prohibited. 
Treatment with concomitant drugs tha t are strong inhibitors or inducers of P -gp and 
concomitant drugs that target serotonin 5HT 1R or 5HT 2BR or sigma nonspecific receptor are to 
be avoided with the exception of drugs that are considered absolutely essential for the care of 
the subject. Treatment with concomitant drugs that are strong inhibitors of CYP3A should be 
avoided with the exception of antibiotics, antifungals and antivirals that are used as standard of 
care to prevent or treat infections. If CYP3A inhibitors are used concomitantl y, subjects should 
be monitored for AEs.  
Precaution should be used in treatment of ASP2215 with concomitant drugs that are known 
to prolong QT or QTc intervals.  
Precaution should be used in treatment of ASP2215 with concomitant drugs that are 
substrates of  BCRP, since the transporter has been shown to be inhibited by [CONTACT_106346]2215 in in 
vitro studies.  
Common CYP3A inhibitors, CYP3A inducers, drugs targeting the serotonin receptor, P -gp 
inhibitors or inducers, and drugs known to prolong QT or QTc intervals are lis ted in 
[Appendix 12.1]. The investigator should consult individual labels for all drugs that the 
subject is taking to evaluate if they fall into an y of the above named categories. For 
concomitant drugs that have the potential to prolong QT or QTc intervals, a cardiology 
consult should be o btained as medically indicated.

● Subject is in CRc  
For subjects resuming treatment, subjects will follow the procedures listed under subsequent 
cycles day 1 in the Schedule of Assessments.  
5.1.5 Treatment Compliance  
Study subjects should be counseled on the need to meet 100% compliance with study drug.  
Investigator or designee should ensure that study subjects meet this goal throughout the study 
period. Compliance will be verified by [CONTACT_559849] y drug at each monthly visit 
after baseline. When study drug is administered at the research facility, it will be 
administered under the supervision of study personnel.  
Compliance of ASP2215 will be monitored by [CONTACT_559850] d 
by [CONTACT_559851]. Compliance will be documented.  
The dose and schedule of ASP2215 and comparative chemotherapy administered to each 
subject will be recorded.  Reasons for dose delay, reduction or omission will also be recorded 
when applicable.  
Treatment compliance should be monitored closely and deviations in compliance should be 
reported to the Sponsor except in cases where directed by [CONTACT_559852] 
(e.g., account for dose interruptions, adjustments, etc.).  
Sponsor: APGD  ISN/Protocol [ADDRESS_735764] 
resolved prior to informed consent. Conditions that are ongoing at the time of consent will be 
collected as baseline condition on the Medical History Electronic Case Report Form (eCRF).  
Details that will be collected include the onset date and recovery date and C TCAE grade, if 
applicable for ongoing conditions.  
5.2.3 Diagnosis of the Target Disease, Severity and Duration of Disease  
AML diagnosis and studies related to AML subtype classification will be collected and will 
include date and method of diagnosis, bone marrow  evaluations, histopathology, 
cytogenetics, immunophenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_559795], FLT3 mutation status performed using 
institutional assay, lumbar puncture results if performed (red blood cell [RBC], white blood 
cell [WBC] and differential, cytospin results ) and related genetic syndromes. Dates for 
diagnostic procedures will be collected.  
Prior HSCT and AML therapy including induction, consolidation and maintenance 
chemotherapy will be collected. Response to HSCT and AML therapy as well as the duration 
of the response will also be collected.  
5.2.4 FLT3 Mutation Status  
FLT3 mutation status will be analyzed by a Sponsor designated central laboratory using bone 
marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_26594]. If bone marrow sample is unavailable (e.g., dry tap), the whole 
blood sample taken at the screening visit will be used.  
Subjects will be screened from the central lab. If the central result is negative, FLT3 testing can 
be repeated during the screening period. All subjects including those with rapi[INVESTIGATOR_559796]. If institutional FLT3 assay is available, 
then the institutional results will be recorded and can be used for randomization only if, in the 
investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], subject has rapi[INVESTIGATOR_559797]. The institutional FLT3 test must have been performed after completion of subject’s 
last interventional treatment. However, central testing will still be performed. Subjects can 
remain on assigned treatment if the randomization  is based on the local test, but central lab 
result is discordant.  
Bone marrow/blood sampling, processing, storage and shipment instructions will be provided 
in the Lab Manual. Refer to the Lab Manual for more detailed information.

At a post baseline visit, subjects will be classified as CRh if they have marrow blasts < 5%, 
partial hematologic recovery ANC ≥  0.5 x 109/L and platelets ≥  50 x 109/L, no evidence of 
extramedullary leukemia and cannot be classified as CR.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Partial Remission  
For subjects to be classified as being in PR at a post -baseline visit, they must have bone 
marrow regenerating normal hematopoietic cells with evidence of peripheral recovery with no 
(or only a few regenerating) circulating blasts and with a decrease of at least 50% in the 
percentage of blasts in the bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_559798] 5% and 
25%. A value of less or equal than 5% blasts is also considered a PR if Auer rods are present.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Not Evaluable/No Response  
In the situation where no bone marrow assessments are performed or myeloblast value is 
missing, blast value from peripheral blood is missing or ≤ 2%, and extramedullary leukemia 
is missing or not done, the response will be classified as not evaluable (NE). In any ca se 
response cannot be categorized as CR, CRp, CRi, PR or NE, it will be categorized as NR.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Relapse 
Relapse after CR, CRh, CRp or CRi is defined as a reappearance of leukemic blasts in the 
peripheral blood or ≥ 5% blasts in the bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_559799].  
Relapse after PR is similarly defined with reappearance of significant numbers of peripheral 
blasts and an increase in the percentage of blasts in the bone marrow asp irate to > 25% not 
attributable to any other cause or reappearance or new appearance of extramedullary 
leukemia.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Best Response  
Best response is defined as the best measured response to treatment for all visits (in the order 
of CR, CRp, CRi, PR, NR and NE) post-baseline. Subjects with best responses of CR, CRp, 
CRi or PR will be considered responders. Subjects who do not achieve at least a best 
response of PR will be considered nonresponders.

Date of last contact [CONTACT_559855].  
[IP_ADDRESS] Event-free Survival  
EFS is defined as the time from the date of randomization until the date of do cumented 
relapse (excluding relapse after PR), treatment failure or death , whichever occurs first. If a 
subject experiences relapse or death, the subject is defined as having EFS event related to 
either “relapse” or “death”, and the event date is the date of relapse or death. If a subject fails 
to achieve any of the response of CR, CRp, CRi or PR during the treatment period, the 
subject is defined as having EFS event related to treatment failure, and the event date is the 
randomization date. For a subject w ho is not known to have had a relapse or treatment failure 
or death event, EFS is censored at the date of last relapse -free disease assessment.  Subject is 
not censored at HSCT.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Leukemia -free Survival  
LFS is defined as the time from the date of first CRc u ntil the date of documented relapse or 
death for subjects who achieve CRc. For a subject who is not known to have relapsed or died, 
LFS is censored on the date of last relapse -free disease assessment date.

Duration of CR/CRh, CRh, CR, CRp, CRi  
Duration of CR/CRh, CRh, CR, CRp, CRi is defined similarly as duration of CRc.  
Duration of Response  
Duration of response is defined as the time from the date of either first CRc or PR until the 
date of documented relapse of any type for subjects who achieve CRc or PR. Subjects who 
die without report of relapse are considered nonevents and censored at the ir last relapse -free 
disease assessment date. Other subjects who do not relapse on study are considered 
nonevents and censored at the last relapse -free assessment date.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Transplantation Rate  
Transplantation rate is defined as the percentage of subjects unde rgoing HSCT during the 
study period.  
5.3.3 Bone Marrow Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_23735]/or Biopsy  
For ASP2215 group, bone marrow samples are required during screening, cycle 2 day 1 and 
cycle 3 day 1. For subjects who do not achieve a CRc (CR, CRp or CRi), the bone marrow 
assessments will be repeated at day 1 of every 2 subsequent cycles. For subjects who achieve

analyses by [CONTACT_41758]).  
Reasonable effort should be made to contact [CONTACT_559857] -up during the course 
of the study in order to complete study -related assessments and retrieve any outstanding data 
and study drug. Following unsuccessful telephone contact, an effort to contact [CONTACT_559858] a method that provides proof of receipt should be attempted. Contact [CONTACT_559859], preapproved contact [CONTACT_559860]. Such efforts 
should be documented in the source documents.  
If a subject death occurs during  the SAE reporting period or if t he death occurs after the SAE 
reporting period, but is determined by [CONTACT_559861], 
then the associated AE with outcome of death will also be reported on the CRF and SAE 
form. If a subject death does not meet the cri teria of an SAE, then death and antileukemic 
treatment and outcome up through the date of death should be collected and entered in CRF.  
5.4 Safety Assessment  
5.4.1 Vital Signs  
Vital signs, including systolic and diastolic blood pressures (mm  Hg), radial pulse rate 
(beats/minute) and temperature will be obtained and recorded at the times specified in the 
Schedule of Assessments. All vital sign measures will be obtained with the subject in the 
sitting or supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547].  
If clinically significant vital sign changes fro m baseline (pretreatment) are noted, the changes 
will be documented as AEs on the AE page of the CRF. Clinical significance will be defined 
as a variation in vital signs, which has medical relevance that could result in an alteration in 
medical care. The i nvestigator will continue to monitor the subject until the parameter returns 
to ≤ grade 1 or to the baseline (pretreatment) value or until the investigator determines that 
follow up is no longer medically necessary.  
5.4.2 Adverse Events  
AE collection will begin from time of informed consent and continue through the 30 day 
follow-up visit. AEs will be documented at each clinic visit, but can be collected at any time.  
Any AE that meets the definition of a SAE will also be reported on a separate form to the 
Sponsor. See [Section 5.5 Adverse Events and Other Safety Aspects] for information 
regarding AE collection and data handling.

ECG tracings bas ed on central reading will be used for final treatment decisions and AE 
reporting.  
A cycle 1 day 8 ECG will be taken and the central read results will be provided to the site 
24 hours after receipt of the tracing. A confirmatory ECG should be performed on cycle 1

9 ECG is still required, the central read ECG will be received on day 10, in which the 
investigator should assess if the ASP2215 dose modification should occur as per the dose 
interruption or reduction guid eline in [Section 5.1.2]. 
If the mean of the triplicate QTcF is > 500 ms at any time point (by [CONTACT_559862]), then triplicate ECGs will be repeated (within 2 hours if 
based on value on ECG tracing printout and as soon as possible if based on central reading). 
If QTcF > 500  ms is confirmed, then the investigator will interrupt and reduce ASP2215 per 
the interruption or reduction guidelines in [ Section 5.1.2]. 
ECGs should be obtained after the subject has rested quietly and is awake in a fully supi[INVESTIGATOR_12251] (or semi -recumbent, if supi[INVESTIGATOR_327695]) for [ADDRESS_735781] ECG from 
a triplicate. Whenever a study procedure coincides with the scheduled timepoint for an ECG 
triplicate, the study activities will ideally be undertaken in a fixed se quence: ECG triplicate 
first, vital signs (blood pressure and heart rate) second and any type of blood draw as the last 
assessment. This order of events can be changed if required in order to accommodate 
pharmacokinetic time points and is not mandatory.  
Sponsor: APGD  ISN/Protocol [ADDRESS_735782] X-ray or computed tomography (CT) scan is to be performed at screening. A chest 
X-ray (or CT of chest) does not need to be repeated if performed within 2 weeks prior to start 
of screening.  
5.4.7 Multigated Acquisition Scan or Echocardiogram  
Multigated acquisition scans or ECHO (as per standard of care) are to be performed at 
screening for subjects with history of congestive heart failure NYHA Class 3 or 4 (unless 
multigated acquisition scans or ECHO performed either wit hin 1 month prior revealed LVEF 
≥ 45%). 
5.4.8 Ophthalmologic Exam  
Ophthalmologic examinations will be conducted during the screening period, day 1 
(± 7 days) of cycle 2, day 1 (± 7 days) of every [ADDRESS_735783]/end of 
treatment (±  7 days) and when clinically indicated . The following tests and exams are 
required at every visit:  
● Visual Acuity: best -corrected visual acuity as per ETDRS or Snellen charts or other 
visual acuity chart testing reported as Logarithm of the Minimum Angle of Resolution  
(logMAR) scores  (For the visual acuity testing using a near card at bedside, the results 
must indicate the vision was tested with a near card.)   
● Ophthalmoscopy  (A dilated ophthalmoscopy can be performed at bedside .) 
In symptomatic subjects, the ophthalmol ogic assessment should also include slit lamp 
biomicroscopy, visual fields performed by [CONTACT_559863].  
5.[ADDRESS_735784] a causal relationship 
with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom or dis ease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal 
(investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product.  
Some countries may have additional local requirements for events that are required to be 
reported as AEs o r in an expedited manner similar to an SAE. In these cases, it is the 
investigator’s responsibility to ensure these AEs or other reporting requirements are followed 
and the information is appropriately recorded in the eCRF accordingly.  
Sponsor: APGD  ISN/Protocol [ADDRESS_735785] (e.g., laboratory parameter, vital sign, ECG 
data, physical exam) should be defined as an AE only if the abnormality meets 1 of the 
following criteria:  
● Induces clinical signs or symptoms.  
● Requires active intervention.  
● Requires i nterruption or discontinuation of study medication.  
● The abnormality or investigational value is clinically significant in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_1070].  
5.5.2 Definition of Serious Adverse Events  
An AE is considered “serious” if, in the view of either the investigator or Sponsor, it results 
in any of the following outcomes:  
● Results in death  
● Is life threatening (an AE is considered “life -threatening” if, in the view of either the 
investigator or Sponsor, its occurrence places the subject at immediate risk of  death.  It 
does not include an AE that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused 
death) 
● Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity or substantial disruption of the 
ability to conduct normal life functions  
● Results in congeni tal anomaly or birth defect  
● Requires in -subject hospi[INVESTIGATOR_28939] 
(hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2476]/observation/examination caused by [CONTACT_295485])  
● Other medically important events  
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting 
is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be 
immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but may jeopardize the 
subject or may require intervention to prevent 1 of the other outcomes listed in the definition 
above. These events, including those that may result in disability/incapacity, should also 
usually be considered serious. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an 
emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that 
do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
Safety events of interest on the medicinal products administered to  the subject as part of the 
study (e.g., study drug, comparator and background therapy) that may require expedited 
reporting and/or safety evaluation include, but are not limited to:  
● Overdose of the medicinal product(s)  
● Suspected abuse/misuse of the medici nal product(s)  
● Inadvertent or accidental exposure to the medicinal product(s)  
● Medication error involving the medicinal product(s) (with or without subject exposure to 
the Sponsor medicinal product, e.g., name [CONTACT_2976])  
Sponsor: APGD  ISN/Protocol [ADDRESS_735786] that also meets the criteria for an SAE should be recorded 
on the AE page of the eCRF and marked ‘serious’ and the SAE worksheet.  
The Sponsor has a list of events that t hey classify as “always serious” events. If an AE is 
reported that is considered to be an event per this classification as “always serious”, 
additional information on the event may be requested.  
5.5.3 Criteria for Causal Relationship to the Study Drug  
AEs that f all under either "Possible" or "Probable" should be defined as "AE whose 
relationship to the study drugs could not be ruled out".  
Causal 
Relationship to 
the Study Drug  Criteria for Causal Relationship  
Not Related  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a temporal 
relationship to drug administration which makes a causal relationship 
improbable and/or in which other drugs, chemicals or underlying disease 
provide plausible explanations.  
Possible A clinical event, including laboratory  test abnormality, with a reasonable 
time sequence to administration of the drug, but which could also be 
explained by [CONTACT_9153].  Information 
on drug withdrawal may be lacking or unclear.  
Probable A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a reasonable 
time sequence to administration of the drug, unlikely to be attributed to 
concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals and which follows a 
clinically reasonable response on readministration (rechal lenge) or 
withdrawal (dechallenge).  
5.5.4 Criteria for Defining the Severity of an Adverse Event  
AEs, including abnormal clinical laboratory values, will be graded using the National Cancer 
Institute (NCI) -CTCAE guidelines (version 4.03).  The items that are not stipulated in the 
NCI-CTCAE version 4.[ADDRESS_735787]  
1-Mild Asymptomatic or mild symptoms, clinical or diagnostic observations 
noted; intervention not indicated  
2-Moderate  Local or noninvasive intervention indicated  
3-Severe Medically significant but not immediately life threatening, 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_13266]  
4-Life Threatening  Life threatening consequences, urgent intervention indicated  
5-Death Death related to adverse event  
Sponsor: APGD  ISN/Protocol [ADDRESS_735788] dose of 
study medication. During the long -term follow -up period, only SAE data for the event that  is 
related to ASP2215 will be collected. Progressive Disease should not be reported as an 
AE/SAE unless the disease progression is the cause of death.  
In the case of a SAE, the investigator must contact [CONTACT_559864], email or fax 
immediately ( within 24 hours of awareness).  
The investigator should complete and submit an SAE Worksheet containing all information

Common SAEs are SAEs commonly anticipated to occur in the study population independent 
of drug exposure. SAEs classified as “common” are provided in [ Appendix 12.4 Common 
Serious Adverse Events]  for your reference. The list does NOT change your reporting 
obligations or prevent the need to report an AE meeting the definition of an SAE as detailed 
above. The purpose of this list is to alert you that some events reported as SAEs may not 
require expedited reporting to the regulatory authorities based on the classification of 
“common serious adverse events” as specified in [ Appendix 12.4 Common Serious Adverse 
Events]. The Sponsor will monitor these events throughout the course of the study for any 
change in frequency. Any changes to this list will be co mmunicated to the participating 
investigational sites. Investigators must report individual occurrences of these events as 
stated in [ Section 5.5.5 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events].

pregnancy result and neonatal data etc., should be included in this inf ormation.  
The investigator will follow the medical status of the mother, as well as the fetus, as if the 
pregnancy is an SAE and will report the outcome to the Sponsor.  
When the outcome of the pregnancy falls under the criteria for SAEs (spontaneous aborti on, 
induced abortion, stillbirth, death of newborn, congenital anomaly [including anomaly in a 
miscarried fetus]), the investigator should respond in accordance with the report procedure 
for SAEs.  Additional information regarding the outcome of a pregnanc y (which is 
categorized as an SAE) is mentioned below.  
● “Spontaneous abortion” includes miscarriage, abortion and missed abortion  
● Death of an infant within 1 month after birth should be reported as an SAE regardless of 
its relationship with the study drug  
● If an infant dies more than 1 month after the birth, it should be reported if a relationship 
between the death and intrauterine exposure to the study drug is judged as “possible” by 
[CONTACT_093]  
● In the case of a delivery of a living newborn, the “normality” of the infant is evaluated at

7 STATISTICAL METHODOL OGY 
The statistical analysis will be coordinated by [CONTACT_201451] -United 
States.  A Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be written to provide details of the analysis, 
along with specifications for tables, listings and figures (TLFs) to be produced. The SAP will 
be finalized before the database soft lock at the latest. Any changes from the analyses 
planned in SAP will be justified in the CSR.  
Prior to database lock, a Final Review of Data and TLFs Meeting will be held to allow a 
review of the clinical trial data and to verify the data that will be used for analysis set 
classification. If required, consequences for the statistical analysis will be discussed and 
documented. A meeting to determine analysis set classifications may also be held prior to 
database lock.  
In general, all data will be summarized with descriptive statistics (number of subjects, mean, 
standard deviation, minimum, median and maximum) for continuous endpoints and 
frequency and percentage for categorical endpoints.

Version 9.2 Incorporating Nonsubstantial Amendment 4  7.1 Sample Size  
This is a group sequential design based on co -primary endpoint of OS using the O’Brien -
Fleming boundaries (non -binding) as implemented by [CONTACT_290941] -DeMets alpha/beta spending 
method (East ®) [Lan & DeMets, 1983] .  
The overall 0.025 one -sided type I error rate is allocated by 0.0005 and 0.0245 (0.001 and 
0.049 for two -sided type I error rate) for the two co -primary efficacy endpoints of CR/CRh 
and OS, respectively. The type I error (alpha) in the first  interim analysis will not be recycled 
in the second interim analysis and  final analysis . 
The first interim analysis is planned when approximately [ADDRESS_735814] 112 days (4 treatment cycles) post first dose or randomization (for 
subjects who received no study drug). The second interim analysis is planned when 
approximately [ADDRESS_735815] occurred. After the completion of the final (primary) 
analysis when approximately [ADDRESS_735816] occurred, additional data summary for 
subjects is planned when ≥ [ADDRESS_735817] been completed.   
OS:  
Approximately 369 subjects (the planned sample size with 10% dropout rate) will be 
randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive ASP2215 or salvage chemotherapy (246 subjects in the 
ASP2215 treatment arm and 123 subjects in the salvage chemotherapy arm). The p lanned 
258 death events will provide about 90% power to detect a difference in OS between the 
ASP2215 arm with 7.7  months median survival time and salvage chemotherapy arm with 
5 months median survival time (hazard ratio = 0.65) at the overall 1 -sided 0.02 45 significance 
level. 
CR/CRh rate:  
The first interim analysis will be conducted only to evaluate the co -primary endpoint of 
CR/CRh. One hundred and forty -one subjects randomized to ASP2215 arm (211 subjects in 
total: 141 in the ASP2215 arm and 70 in the salvage chemotherapy arm) with a minimum 
follow-up of 4 treatment cycles are considered to achieve a maximum width of 15.78% for 
the two-sided 95% exact confidence interval (CI) when the CR/CRh is expected to be in the 
5% to 30% range as summarized in belo w table. A sample size of 141 subjects provides 80% 
power to exclude a CR/CRh rate of 12% using the two -sided 95% exact CI when the CR/CRh 
rate of ASP2215 is assumed to be 21%.

Version 9.2 Incorporating Nonsubstantial Amendment 4  7.2.1 Intention To Treatment Set  
The Intention t o Treatment Set (ITT) will c onsist of all subjects who are randomized and will 
be used for primary efficacy analysis. The subjects will be analyzed based on the randomized 
treatments.  
7.2.2 Response Analysis Set  
The Response Analysis S et (RAS) consists of subjects who are at least [ADDRESS_735827] 
dose or randomization (for subjects who received no study drug). The subjects will be 
analyzed based on the randomized treatments.  
The RAS will be used only at the interim analyses and will be used for primary analyses of 
response related effi cacy data.  
7.2.3 Full Analysis Set  
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) will consist of all subjects who are randomized with FLT3 
mutation based on the central test and will be used for efficacy sensitivity analysis. The 
subjects will be analyzed based on the randomized  treatments.  
7.2.4 Per Protocol Set  
The Per Protocol Set (PPS) will consist of the subset of the FAS who do not meet criteria for 
PPS exclusion. These criteria are to capture relevant nonadherence to the protocol and will be 
defined in the SAP. The sensitivity a nalysis for the primary and key secondary efficacy 
endpoints will be performed on PPS.  Select demographic and baseline characteristics may 
also be summarized for the PPS.  
7.2.5 Modified Response Analysis Set  
The modified Response Analysis Set (mRAS) will consist of the subset of the R AS who do 
not meet the criteria for mRAS exclusion. These criteria are to capture relevant nonadherence 
to the protocol  and other factors may impact the response assessment and will be defined in 
the SAP. The sensi tivity analy sis for the primary endpoint of CR/CRh rate  will be performed 
on mRAS.   
7.2.6 Safety Analysis Set  
For the statistical summary of the safety data, the Safety Analysis Set (SAF) will be used.  
The SAF consists of all subjects who took at least 1 dose of study tre atment (ASP2215 or 
salvage chemotherapy) and will be used for safety analyses. The subjects will be analyzed 
based on the actual treatment received.  
7.2.7 Pharmacokinetic Analysis Set  
The pharmacokinetic analysis set (PKAS ) consists of the subset of the SAF for which at least

supplements) will be summarized by [CONTACT_43732] (PT) for SAF.  
Medications will be coded using the WHO drug dictionary. Medications will be counted by 
[CONTACT_255148]. A subject taking the same medication 
multiple times will only be counted once for that medication. Medications will be presented 
in decreasing order of frequency based on the total number of subjects who took each 
medication.

the corresponding 95% CI.  
7.4.1 Analysis of Co -Primary Endpoints  
OS: 
The co-primary efficacy endpoint of OS will be analyzed using the stratified log-rank test with 
strata to control for response to first -line AML therapy and preselected salvage chemotherapy 
on the Intention to Treatment (ITT) Analysis Set. The ITT is defined as all subjects who are 
randomized and the analysis is based on the randomized treatment.  
The hypothesis testing on the primary analysis of OS will be performed to test the n ull 
hypothesis that OS in the ASP2215 arm is worse than or equal to OS in the salvage 
chemotherapy arm.  
The sensitivity analysis for the primary efficacy endpoint of OS will be performed as follows:  
● Same analysis as primary analysis , but on FAS, which inc luded all randomized subjects 
who are FLT3 mutated subjects based on central test ; 
● Same analysis as primary analysis , but on PPS, which include all subjects in ITT and do 
not have any major PDs;  
● Stratified Cox proportional hazard model with strata to contr ol for response to first -line 
AML therapy and preselected salvage chemotherapy on ITT;  
● Same analysis as primary analysis on ITT, but censoring the subjects who undergo 
HSCT at the time of HSCT;  
● To account for the possible confounding effect due to subsequ ent anti-leukemia 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], a sensitivity analysis of OS that censors subjects at the time of initiation of 
new therapy will be performed and an OS analysis that treats initiation of new therapy as 
a time-dependent binary covariate will also be conducted.  
● Additional sensitivity analysis may be performed to compare the survival curves when 
the proportional hazards (PH) assumption is plausible.   
CR/CRh:  
The two-sided 95% exact confidence interval of CR/CRh rate will be calculated for 
approximately  [ADDRESS_735832] 112 days 
(4 treatment cycles) post first dose or randomization (for subjects who received no study 
drug), i.e. , 2215 subjects in RAS. The lower limit will be used to compare with the 
benchmark of CR/CRh rate of 12%.  
Sensitivity analyses will be performed to assess the robustness of the CR/CRh rate based on:  
● Same population as for the primary analysis, bu t only include subjects in mRAS ; 
● Same population as for the primary analysis , but only include subject s who took at least 
one dose of ASP2215;  
● Same population as for the primary analysis , but only include subjects who had at least

7.4.2 Analysis of Secondary Endpoints  
[IP_ADDRESS] Key Secondary Efficacy Analysis  
EFS: 
The key secondary efficacy endpoint of EFS will be analyzed using the stratified log -rank 
test with strata to control for response to first -line AML therapy and preselected salvage 
chemotherapy on the ITT. To maintain the overall Type I error rate at the 0 .0245 significance 
level, the hypothesis testing on EFS will be performed only if the null hypothesis on the 
primary analysis of OS is rejected at its corresponding significance level for the second 
interim analysis and final analysis.  
The sensitivity ana lysis for the key secondary efficacy endpoint of EFS will be performed as 
follows:  
● Same analysis as primary analysis , but on FAS, which includes all randomized subjects 
who are FLT3 mutated subjects based on central test ; 
● Same analysis as primary analysis , but on PPS, which includes all subjects in ITT and do 
not have any major PDs;  
● Stratified Cox proportional hazard model with strata to control for response to first -line 
AML therapy and preselected salvage chemotherapy on ITT;  
● EFS will be defined similar ly as in Section [IP_ADDRESS], however the date of the first new 
anti-leukemia therapy after end of study treatment or the last treatment evaluation (when 
new anti-leukemia therapy date is not available) will be used as the event date of 
treatment failure;  
● EFS will be defined similarly as in Section [IP_ADDRESS], however subjects who d iscontinued 
the treatment due to “Lost to follow up” will also be considered as an EFS event and the 
subjects will be censored at the date of “Lost to follow up”.  
CR rate: 
The key secondary efficacy endp oint of CR rate will be tested  using the Cochran -Mantel-
Haenszel (CMH) test to control for response to first -line AML therapy and preselected 
salvage chemotherapy on the ITT. To maintain the overall Type I error rate at the 
0.0245 significance level, the hypothesis testing on CR rate will be performed only i f the null 
hypothesis on EFS is rejected at its corresponding significance level for second interim 
analysis and final analysis.

An exploratory analysis of FLT3 mutation status and clinical efficacy will be conducted.  
FLT3 mutation status, including subgroups of FLT3 ITD mutation, D835/I836 TKD 
mutations and allelic ratio, will be analyzed. Additional biomarkers related to AML and 
ASP2215 activity may be analyzed.  
CMH method will be used for resource utilization status (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], blood transfusion, 
antibiotic iv infusions, medication for AEs and opi[INVESTIGATOR_2536]); and ANCOVA model 
will be used for resource utilization counts  (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7959], duration of medications, blood 
transfusions, antibiotic iv infusions, medication for AEs and opi[INVESTIGATOR_2536]).  
ANCOVA model will be used to analyze the change in the FACIT -Dys-SF domain scores 
from baseline to post -baseline visits.  
ANCOVA model will be used to evaluate change from baseline to post -baseline visits for the 
global and domain scores, individual items and item clusters of the FACT -Leu. The same 
analytic approach will be used for the dizziness and mouth sore items.  
ANCOVA mode l will be used for the change from baseline of EQ -5D-5L VAS and shift 
table for the 5 dimensions (mobility, self -care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/ 
depression) baseline to post -baseline visits.

7.6 Analysis of Pharmacokinetics  
Based on pharmacokinetic data obtained within this study, a separate population 
pharmacokinetic analysis will be performed. Data f rom this study may be pooled with other 
studies for analysis. The prospective details of this analysis will be specified in a separate 
population pharmacokinetic analysis plan.  
7.7 Protocol Deviations  
PDs as defined in [ Section 8.1.6 Protocol Deviations] will be summarized for all randomized 
subjects by [CONTACT_190933]. A data listing will be provided by [CONTACT_190934].  
The PD criteria will  be uniquely identified in the summary table and listing. The unique 
identifiers will be as follows:  
PD1-Entered into the study even though they did not satisfy entry criteria,  
PD2-Developed withdrawal criteria during the study and was not withdrawn,  
PD3-Received wrong treatment or incorrect dose,  
PD4-Received excluded concomitant treatment.  
7.8 Interim Analysis (and Early Discontinuation of the Clinical Study)  
To evaluate whether ASP2215 is particularly beneficial or harmful compared to the 
benchmark data or t he salvage chemotherapy group while the study is ongoing, two interim 
analyses are planned.  
First Interim Analysis  
The first interim analysis is planned when approximately [ADDRESS_735837] 112 days (4 treatment cycl es) post first dose or randomization (for 
subjects who received no study drug). At the first interim analysis, only the co -primary 
endpoint of CR/CRh rate will be evaluated in the ASP2215 arm only. The descriptive 
statistics including two -sided 95% exact C I of CR/CRh rate will be provided to IDMC. The 
historical control of the CR/CRh rate is considered to be 12%. The IDMC will evaluate the 
CR/CRh rate and inform the Sponsor if the lower limit is higher than the historical control or 
not. The study conduct w ill not be impacted by [CONTACT_559873].  
A nominal 1 -sided p-value 0.0005 (i.e., 2 -sided p-value 0.001), which is arbitrarily selected, 
will be spent to acknowledge the single -arm CR/CRh rate evaluation at the first interim

Version 9.2 Incorporating Nonsubstantial Amendment 4  analysis, and will not be recycled in the second interim analysis and  final analysis . No formal 
hypothesis testing will be conducted for CR/CRh rate for the study, only the descriptive 
statistics including 2 -sided 95% exact CI of CR/CRh rate will be provided to IDMC at t he 
first interim. The hypothesis testing for the primary and secondary endpoints of OS, EFS and 
CR rate at the secondary interim analysis and final analysis are well controlled at an overall 
1-sided type I error rate 0.0245 based on a sequent ial testing pr ocedure. 
Second Interim Analysis  
The second interim analysis will be performed when approximately 50% of the total planned 
death events (death events = 129) have occurred in the study. OS will be tested at 1 -sided 
0.[ZIP_CODE]/0.[ZIP_CODE] significant level for effi cacy/futility according to the O’Brien -Fleming type 
alpha/beta spending function.  
The IDMC may recommend terminating the trial for favorable or unfavorable results at the 
second interim analysis based on OS endpoint. In the case of favorable results (i.e. , the 
1-sided P-value is less than 0.[ZIP_CODE]), the IDMC may recommend terminating the trial for 
success. In the case of unfavorable results (i.e., the 1 -sided P-value is greater than 0.[ZIP_CODE]), 
the IDMC may recommend terminating the trial for futility.  
EFS will be tested when the null hypothesis of OS is rejected at the second interim. CR rate 
will be tested when the null hypotheses of both OS and EFS are rejected at the second interim. 
Their significance levels at the second interim and final interim wi ll be based on Pocock/ 
O’Brien-Fleming alpha/beta spending function. See Table [ADDRESS_735839] safety, enrollment  rates and event (death) 
rates will be contained in the Interim Analysis Plan (IAP) and IDMC Charter. 
Recommendations regarding study conduct will be made by [CONTACT_559874].  
If the study is not stopped after the second interim analysis, a final analysis based on OS wil l 
occur after 100% of the total planned death events (death events = 258) have been observed.  
The 1-sided significance level for  the final analysis is 0.[ZIP_CODE] for OS .

● ALT or AST > 5 × ULN for more than 2 weeks (in the absence of liver metastases)  
● ALT or AST > 3 × ULN and International normalization ratio (INR) > 1.5 (If INR 
testing is applicable/evaluated).  
● ALT or AST > 3 × ULN with the appearance of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper 
quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash and/or eosinophilia (> 5%).  
The investigator may determine that abnormal liver function results, other than as described 
above, may qualify as moderate or severe abnormalities and require additional monitoring 
and follow -up. 
Follow-up Procedures  
Confirmed moderate and severe abnormalitie s in hepatic functions should be thoroughly 
characterized by [CONTACT_317257], detailed pertinent history, 
physical examination and laboratory tests.  The site should complete the Liver Abnormality -
Case Report Form (LA -CRF) or app ropriate document.  Subjects with confirmed abnormal 
liver function testing should be followed as described below.  
Confirmed moderately abnormal LFTs should be repeated [ADDRESS_735879] is 
asymptomatic.  
Sponsor: APGD  ISN/Protocol [ADDRESS_735880] ed and informed of all subjects for whom severe hepatic liver 
function abnormalities possibly attributable to study drug are observed.  
To further assess abnormal hepatic laboratory findings, the investigator is expected to:  
● Obtain a more detailed history o f symptoms and prior or concurrent diseases.  Symptoms 
and new onset -diseases should be recorded as ‘AEs’ on the AE page of eCRF. Illnesses 
and conditions such as hypotensive events and decompensated cardiac disease that may 
lead to secondary liver abnorma lities should be noted.  Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis is 
seen in obese hyperlipoproteinemic and/or diabetic subjects and may be associated with 
fluctuating aminotransferase levels. The investigator should ensure that the medical 
history form captures any i llness that predates study enrollment that may be relevant in 
assessing hepatic function.  
● Obtain a history of concomitant drug use (including nonprescription medication, 
complementary and alternative medications), alcohol use, recreational drug use and 
special diets. Medications, including dose, should be entered on the concomitant 
medication page of the eCRF. Information on alcohol, other substance use and diet 
should be entered on the LA -CRF or an appropriate document.  
● Obtain a history of exposure to envi ronmental chemical agents.  
● Based on the subject’s history, other testing may be appropriate including:  
o acute viral hepatitis (A,B, C, D, E or other infectious agents)  
o ultrasound or other imaging to assess biliary tract disease  
o other laboratory tests includ ing INR, direct bilirubin  
● Consider gastroenterology or hepatology consultations.  
● Submit results for any additional testing and possible etiology on the LA -CRF or an 
appropriate document.  
Study Discontinuation  
In the absence of an explanation for increased LFTs, such as viral hepatitis, preexisting or 
acute liver disease, presence of liver metastases or exposure to other agents associated with 
liver injury, the subject may be discontinued from the study. The investigator may determine 
that it is not in the s ubject’s best interest to continue study enrollment. Discontinuation of 
treatment should be considered if:  
● ALT or AST > 8 × ULN 
● ALT or AST > 5 × ULN for more than 2 weeks (in subjects without liver metastases)  
● ALT or AST > 3 × ULN and TBL > 2 × ULN or INR > 1.5 (If INR testing is 
applicable/evaluated)  
● ALT or AST > 5 × ULN and TBL > 2 × ULN (in subjects with liver metastases)  
● ALT or AST > 3 × ULN with the appearance of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper 
quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash and/or eos inophilia (> 5%).  
In addition, if close monitoring for a subject with moderate or severe hepatic laboratory tests 
is not possible, drug should be discontinued.

Version 9.2 Incorporating Nonsubstantial Amendment 4  12.5 Retrospective PGx Sub -study (Optional)  
INTRODUCTION  
PGx research aims to provide information regarding how naturally occurring changes in a 
subject’s gene and/or expression based on genetic variation may impact what treatment 
options are best suited for the subject. Through investigation of PGx by [CONTACT_327746][INVESTIGATOR_007], gene sequencing, statistical genetics and Genome -Wide Association Studies, the 
relationship between gene profiles and a drug’s kinetics, efficacy or toxicity may be better 
understood. As many diseases may be influenced by [ADDRESS_735888] may or may 
not respond to a drug.  
OBJECTIVES  
The PGx research that may be conducted in the future with acquired blood samples is 
exploratory. The objective of this research will be to analyze  or determine  genes of relevance 
to AML subjects’ clinical response, pharmacokinetics and toxicity/safety concerns in relation 
to ASP2215 treatment.  
By [CONTACT_317262], it may be possible to predict an individual subject’s response 
to treatment in terms of efficacy and/or toxicity.  
SUBJECT PARTICIPATIO N 
Subjects who have consented to participate in this study may participate in this PGx 
sub-study. As part of this sub -study, subjects must provide written consent prior to providing 
any blood samples that may be used at a later time for genetic analysis.  
For subjects study, subjects who have consented to participate in this study may participate in 
this PGx sub -study. As part of this sub -study, subjects must provide separate written cons ent 
prior to providing any blood samples that may be used at a later time for genetic analysis.  
SAMPLE COLLECTION AND STORAGE  
Subjects who consent to participate in this sub -study will provide a 3  mL whole blood sample 
and a buccal swab per Astellas’ instr uctions. Each sample will be identified by [CONTACT_559889] (first code). Samples will be shipped frozen to a designated banking CRO 
either directly from site or via a central laboratory as directed by [CONTACT_77818].  
PGx ANALYSIS  
Details on the potenti al PGx analysis cannot be established yet. Astellas may initiate the PGx 
analysis in case evidence suggests that genetic variants may be influencing  the drug’s 
kinetics, efficacy and/or safety.

Version 9.2 Incorporating Nonsubstantial Amendment 4  12.7 Clinical Study Continuity  
INTRODUCTION  
The purpose of this appendix is to provide acceptable alternate methods to assess safety and 
efficacy parameters, as appropriate, in the event the clinical study is interrupted at the 
country, state, site or participant level during any crisis (e.g., natural disaster, pandemic).    
BENEFIT -RISK RATIONALE  
Maintaining the safety of clinical study participants and delivering continuity of care in the 
clinical study setting is paramount during any crisis. The site is expected to follow the 
protocol and associated Schedule of Assessments on Table 1 and Table 2 unless the site 
principal investig ator (PI) discusses the need with the Astellas Medical Monitor to implement 
the alternate measures.  
The approach outlined within this appendix defines which assessments are required to 
maintain a favorable benefit/risk to the participant, to maintain over all study integrity and to 
provide acceptable alternate methods to complete the study required assessments and 
procedures if study activities are unable to be performed due to a crisis.  
INFORMED CONSENT  
Participants who need to follow any or all of the alt ernate measures outlined in this Appendix 
will be required to provide informed consent , which explicitl y informs them of the nature of  
and rationale for these changes, and gain their agreement to continue participation in the 
study prior to the implementat ion of any of these changes. In the event the urgency of 
implementing the alternate measures does not allow for the participant to provide written 
consent prior to implementation, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_559807] w ritten documentation as soon as is feasible. A separate addendum to the 
study informed consent will be provided to document the participant’s consent of the 
changes. 
PARTICIPANT PROCEDURES ASSESSMENT  
Sites with participants who are currently enrolled into this clinical study may consider 
implementing the alternate methods outlined below if one or more of the following 
conditions are met due to the crisis:  
● Regional or local travel has been restricted, inclusive of mandatory shelter in place 
measures, which m akes participant travel to/from the study site nearly impossible . 
● Site facilities have been cl osed for clinical study conduct.  
● Site has been restricted to treating patients with conditions outside of the scope of the 
study. 
● Site personnel have temporarily relocated the conduct of the study to a location that 
place a burden on the participant with respect to time and travel . 
● Participant(s) have temporarily relocated from the current study site to an alternate study 
site to avoid placing a burden on the parti cipant with respect to travel .

Version 9.2 Incorporating Nonsubstantial Amendment 4  ● Participant(s) have temporarily relocated from their home location and the new distances 
from the site would cause undue burden with respect to time and travel . 
● Participant has risk factors for which traveling to the site pos es an additional risk to the 
participant’s health and safety . 
Adherence to the original protocol as reflected in the Schedule of Assessment Table [ADDRESS_735895] ( IMP) and maintaining critical 
safety and efficacy assessments for patients participating in the study at a time of crisis.  
If one or more of the altern ate measures noted below is implemented for a participant, the site 
should document in the participant’s source document the justification for implementing the 
alternate measure and the actual alternate measures that were implemented, along with the 
corresponding time point(s).  
All other assessments should be completed as outlined in Table 1 and Table 2.

Version 9.2 Incorporating Nonsubstantial Amendment 4  a. ASP2215 is taken daily at home except for clinic days when it will be taken at the clinic.  
b. Height measurement performed only at screening. Weight measurement should be performed at screening and day 1 of each cycle.  
c. Obtained predose.  
d. Screening ECG is required. ECG assessment will be evaluated at predose of cycle 1 day 1, cycle 1 day 8, cycle 1 day  15 and day 1 of each subsequent cycle. Predose assessments 
should be taken within 1 hour before drug administration. The 12 -lead ECGs will be recorded in triplicate ([ADDRESS_735900] 5 
minutes apart per ti me point) and transmitted electronically for central reading. The mean QTcF of the triplicate ECG tracings based on central r eading will be used for final 
treatment decisions and AE reporting. If the mean of the triplicate QTcF is > 500 ms at any time poin t (by [CONTACT_559892]), then triplicate 
ECGs will be repeated (within 2 hours if based on value on ECG tracing printout and as soon as possible if based on central r eading). If the repeat ECG confirms a mean of the 
triplicate QTcF >  500 ms, dosing of ASP2215 will be interrupted for up to 14 days. While ASP2215 may be interrupted temporarily based on value on E CG tracing printout, the 
central reading should be used for final treatment decisions. Cardiology consult will  be obtained as medically indicated. If QTcF resolves to ≤ 480 ms (grade 1 or less) by [CONTACT_559893] [ADDRESS_735901] may resume dosing at the reduced dose.  
e. A cycle 1 day 8 ECG will be taken and the central read results will be provided to the site 24 hours after receipt of the tracing.  A confirmatory ECG should be performed on 
cycle 1 day 9 if the mean QTcF from cycle 1 day 1 to cycle 1 day 8 has increased >  [ADDRESS_735902] to be contact[CONTACT_559827] 1 day 9 ECG is no longer 
required. If the cycle 1 day 9 ECG is still required, the result of the central read ECG will be received on cycle 1 day 10, in which the inves tigator should assess if the ASP2215 
dose modification should occur as per the dose interruption or reduction guideline in Section 5.1.2. 
f. Thyroid function tests will be repeated after every 2 cycles of therapy (C3D1, C5D1, C7D1, etc.).   
g. Urinalysis only required at screening. Uric acid will be tested on days 1, 4, [ADDRESS_735903] 
of care. 
h. Bone marrow samples are required during screening, cycle 2 day 1 and cycle 3 day 1. For subjects who do not achieve a CRc (CR , CRp or CRi), the bone marrow assessments 
will be repeated at day 1 of every 2 subsequent cycle s. For subjects who achieve a CRc (CR, CRp or CRi), bone marrow sampling will be repeated on [ADDRESS_735904] visit/end of treatment visit 
and as clinically indicated. If bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_317140] (e.g., dry tap), an additional EDTA tube of whole blood should be collected instead.  Bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_559808], and bone marrow biopsy is  preferred.  In case of inadequate aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337], bone marrow biopsy is required.  
i. Ophthalmologic assessment to be performed by [CONTACT_559894], day 1 (± 7 days) of cycle 2, day 1 (± 7 days) of every 
2 cycles thereafter, and when clinically indicated.  In symptomatic subjects, the ophthalmologic assessment should also include  slit lamp biomicroscopy, visual fields performed 
by [CONTACT_559826].  
j. PK samples for ASP2215 wi ll be collected on cycle 1 day 1 predose, cycle 1 day 8 predose and at cycle 1 day 15 and day 1 predose of each subsequent cy cle (within1 hour before 
drug administration).  See Section 7.6.   
 
 
Sponsor: APGD  ISN/Protocol [ADDRESS_735905] SUPPLY  
If any of the conditions outlined above in the Participants Procedures Assessment are met, 
one or all of the following mitigating strategies will be employed, as needed, to ensure 
continuity of IMP supply to the participants:   
● Increase stock of IMP on site to reduce number of shipments required, if site space will 
allow.  
● Direct-to-Participant shipments of IMP from the site to the participant’s home.  
DATA COLLECTION REQUIREMENTS  
Additional data may be collected in order to indicate how participation in the study may have 
been affected by a crisis and to accommodate data collection resulting from alternate 
measures implemented to manage the conduct of the study and participant safe ty.  
● Critical assessments for safety and efficacy based on study endpoints to be identified as 
missing or altered (performed virtually, at alternative locations, out of window, or other 
modifications) due to the crisis.

Version 9.2 Incorporating Nonsubstantial Amendment 4  12.7 Clinical Study Continuity  
INTRODUCTION  
The purpose of this appendix is to provide acceptable alternate methods to assess safety 
and efficacy parameters, as appropriate, in the event the clinical study is interrupted at 
the country, state, site or participant level during any crisis (e.g., natur al disaster, 
pandemic).    
BENEFIT -RISK RATIONA LE 
Maintaining the safety of clinical study participants and delivering continuity of care in 
the clinical study setting is paramount during any crisis. The site is expected to follow 
the protocol and associat ed Schedule of Assessments on Table 1  and Table 2  unless the 
site PI [INVESTIGATOR_559809].  
The approach outlined within this appendix defines which assessments are required to 
maintain a favorable benefit/risk to the participant, to maintain overall study integrity 
and to provide acceptable alternate methods to complete the study required 
assessments and procedures if study activities are unable to be performed due to a 
crisis. 
INFORMED CO NSENT 
Participants who need to follow any or all of the alternate measures outlined in this 
Appendix will be required to provide informed consent , which explicitly informs them 
of the nature of and rationale for these changes, and gain their agreement to c ontinue 
participation in the study prior to the implementation of any of these changes. In the 
event the urgency of implementing the alternate measures does not allow for the 
participant to provide written consent prior to implementation, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_89786] e will 
obtain oral agreement from the subject followed by [CONTACT_559897]. A separate addendum to the study informed consent will be provided to 
document the participant’s consent of the changes.  
PARTICIPANT PROCEDUR ES ASSESSME NT 
Sites with participants who are currently enrolled into this clinical study may consider 
implementing the alternate methods outlined below if one or more of the following 
conditions are met due to the crisis:  
• Regional or local travel has been restricted, inclusive of mandatory shelter in place 
measures, which makes participant travel to/from the study site nearly impossible . 
• Site facilities have been cl osed for clinical study conduct.  
• Site has been restricted to treating patients with condition s outside of the scope of 
the study . 
• Site personnel have temporarily relocated the conduct of the study to a location that 
Sponsor: APGD  ISN/Protocol [ADDRESS_735925] to time and travel . 
• Participant(s) have temporarily relocated from the current study s ite to an alternate 
study site  to avoid placing a burden on the participant with respect to travel . 
• Participant(s) have temporarily relocated from their home location and the new 
distances from the site would cause undue burden with respect to time and tra vel. 
• Participant has risk factors for which traveling to the site poses an additional risk to 
the participant’s health and safety . 
Adherence to the original protocol as reflected in the Schedule of Assessment Table 1 
and Table 2 is expected, where plausible, in the case of a crisis. The alternate measures 
as noted in Table 11 below are only permissible in the event of a crisis, and after 
discussing the need with the Astellas Medical Monitor to implement the alternate 
measures.  This is to allow for continuity of receiving IMP and maintaining critical 
safety and efficacy assessments for patients participating in the study at a time of crisis.  
If one or more of the alternate measures noted below is implemented for a participant, 
the site should documen t in the participant’s source document the justification for 
implementing the alternate measure and the actual alternate measures that were 
implemented, along with the corresponding time point(s).  
All other assessments should be completed as outlined in Table [ADDRESS_735926]  SUPPLY  
If any of the conditions outlined above in the Participants Procedures Assessment are 
met, one or all of the following mitigating strategies will be employed, as needed, to 
ensure continuity of I MP supply to the participants:   
• Increase stock of IMP on site to reduce number of shipments required, if site 
space will allow.  
• Direct-to-Participant (DTP) shipments of IMP from the site to the participant’s 
home.  
DATA COLLECTION REQU IREMENTS  
Additional data may be collected in order to indicate how participation in the study 
may have been affected by a crisis and to accommodate data collection resulting from 
alternate measures implemented to manage the conduct of the study and participant 
safety.  
• Critical assessments for safety and efficacy based on study endpoints to be 
identified as missing or altered (performed virtually, at alternative locations, out 
of window, or other modifications) due to the crisis.

a.     ASP2215 is taken daily at home except for clinic days when it will be taken at the clinic.  
b.     Height measurement performed only at screening. Weight measurement should be performed at screening and day 1 of each cycle. 
c.     Obtained predose. 
d.     Screening ECG is required. ECG assessment will be evaluated at predose of cycle 1 day 1, cycle 1 day 8, cycle 1 day 15  and day 1 of each subsequent cycle. Predose 
assessments should be taken within 1 hour before drug administration. The 12 -lead ECGs will be recorded in triplicate ([ADDRESS_735930] 5 minutes apart per time point) and transmitted electronically for central reading. The mean QTcF of the triplicate ECG tracings based on central 
reading will be used for final treatment decisions and AE reporting. If the mean of the triplicate QTcF is > 500 ms at any tim e point (by [CONTACT_559898]), then triplicate ECGs will be repeated (within 2 hours if base d on value on ECG tracing printout and as soon as possible if based on 
central reading). If the repeat ECG confirms a mean of the triplicate QTcF >  500 ms, dosing of ASP2215 will be interrupted for up to 14 days. While ASP2215 may 
be interrupted temporaril y based on value on ECG tracing printout, the central reading should be used for final treatment decisions. Cardiology consul t will be 
obtained as medically indicated. If QTcF resolves to ≤ 480 ms (grade 1 or less) by [CONTACT_559824] [ADDRESS_735931] may resume dosing at the reduced dose.

Version 9.2 Incorporating Nonsubstantial Amendment 4  e.    A cycle 1 day 8 ECG will be taken and the central read results will be provided to the site 24 hours after receipt of the tra cing.  A confirmatory ECG should be performed on 
cycle 1 day 9 if the mean QTcF from cycle 1 day 1 to cycle 1 day 8 has increased >  [ADDRESS_735933] to be contact[CONTACT_559827] 1 day 9 ECG is no 
longer required.  If the cycle 1 day 9 ECG is still required, the result of the central read ECG will be received on cycle 1 day 10, in which t he investigator should assess if the 
ASP2215 dose modification should occur as per the dose interruption or reduction guideline in  Section 5.1.2. 
f.     Thyroid function tests will be repeated after every 2 cycles of therapy (C3D1, C5D1, C7D1, etc.).   
g.    Urinalysis only required at screening. Uric acid will be tested on days 1, 4, [ADDRESS_735934] 
of care. 
h.     Bone marrow samples are required during screening, cycle 2 day 1 and cycle 3 day 1. For subjects who do not achieve a CRc (CR, CRp or CRi), the bone marrow assessments 
will be repeated  at day 1 of every 2 subsequent cycles. For subjects who achieve a CRc (CR, CRp or CRi), bone marrow sampling will be repeated  on [ADDRESS_735935] visit/end of treatment visit 
and as clinically indicated. If bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_317140] (e.g., dry tap), an additional EDTA tube of whole blood should be collected instead.  Bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337] i s 
required, and bone marrow biopsy is preferred.  In case of inadequate aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337], bone marrow biopsy is required.  
i.     Ophthalmologic assessment to be performed by [CONTACT_559894],  day 1 (± 7 days)  of cycle 2, day 1 (± 7 days) of 
every 2 cycles thereafter, and when clinically indicated.  In symptomatic subjects, the ophthalmologic assessment should also  include slit lamp biomicroscopy, visual fields 
performed by [CONTACT_559899].  
j.     PK samples for ASP2215 will be collected on cycle 1 day 1 predose, cycle 1 day 8 predose and at cycle 1 day 15 and day  1 predose of each subsequent cycle (within1 hour 
before drug administration).  See Section  7.6.

Version 9.2 Incorporating Nonsubstantial Amendment 4  III.  Non-Substantial Amendment Rationale:  
Rationale for Non substantial Designation  
This is a nonsubstantial amendment in that there is an increase in the duration of the trial in 
which exposure to treatment with the study drug is not extended, the definition of the end of 
the trial is unchanged a nd patient monitoring activities are unchanged.

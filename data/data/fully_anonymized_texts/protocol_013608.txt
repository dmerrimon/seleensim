BACKGROUND 
Vascular access is one of the most challenging and expensive aspects of hemodialysis care. Use  of an AV 
access (fistula or graft) is associated with improved quality of life, lower sepsis risk,  and lower hospi[INVESTIGATOR_854219] a central venous catheter.  (1-5) However, <20% of individuals in the 
US start maintenance hemodialysis with a viable AV access. (6) To date, no effective intervention for 
improving AV access creation rates prior to dialysis initiation has been identified. Furthermore, we lack 
essential data on key barriers to pre-dialysis AV access creation. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_854220] a central venous catheter, rates of AV access creation 
prior to dialysis remain low. Evidence-based, pre-dialysis initiation interventions to improve these rates and 
associated clinical outcomes are lacking. Interventions that simultaneously focus on care process barriers such 
as health system navigation and patient barriers such as attitude, fear and knowledge may improve the rates of 
hemodialysis initiation with an AV access.  
 
We will implement a Vascular Access Navigation and Education Quality Improvement Program in the Geisinger 
Danville, PA chronic kidney disease clinic among individuals with advanced CKD who are nearing dialysis . 
The Program addresses both care process and patient-level barriers to AV access creation prior to hemodialysis 
initiation. The program includes: 1) vascular access care navigation, 2) vascular access education, 3) needs and 
barriers assessment, 4) peer mentoring, and 5) an electronic health record dashboard to track patient progress 
through the vascular access placement process.

STUDY OBJECTIVE 
The overall objective of the Quality Improvement Program is to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and 
capacity to improve AV access care process confidence and knowledge and potential to yield improvements in 
pre-emptive AV access creation. This protocol pertains to the research portion of the Quality Improvement 
Program. The objective of the research portion is to evaluate the Quality Improvement Program’s effect  on 
patient’s vascular access knowledge and confidence and providers’ confidence helpi[INVESTIGATOR_854221]-related care processes. 
 
SPECIFIC AIM AND HYPOTHESES 
Specific Aim  1: Evaluate the Vascular Access Navigation and Education Quality Improvement Program’s 
effect on patient vascular access knowledge by [CONTACT_178537] - and post-program scores on a vascular access 
questionnaire. We hypothesize that patient vascular access knowledge will impr ove pre- to post-program. 
 
Specific Aim 2: Evaluate the Vascular Access Navigation and Education Quality Improvement Program’s 
effect on patient vascular access confidence (self -efficacy) by [CONTACT_178537]- and post-program scores on 
the Self -Efficacy for Managing Chronic Disease questionnaire (adapted to be specific to vascular access).  We 
hypothesize that patient vascular access confidence will improve pre - to post-program. 
 Specific Aim 3: Evaluate the Vascular Access Navigation and Education Quality Impr ovement Program’s 
effect on providers’ confidence helpi[INVESTIGATOR_854221] -related care processes by 
[CONTACT_178537]- and post-program scores on a provider vascular access confidence questionnaire.  We 
hypothesize that provider confidence helpi[INVESTIGATOR_854221] -related care processes will 
improve pre- to post-program.

 Source and Recruitment 
Source: 
Patients: Up to 40 advanced chronic kidney disease patients meeting selection criteria will be recruited from the 
Geisinger Health Systems Danville Nephrology Clinic.  
 
Providers and personnel: 30-40 providers and staff involved in AV access creation (nephrologists, vascular 
surgeons, interventionalists, vascular access navigator, and clinic nurses, managers and schedulers) will be recruited from the Danville Nephrology Clinic and associated Vascular Surgery, Transplant surgery,  and 
Radiology Clinics.  
Recruitment: 
Patients: Geisinger nurses serving as the Vascular Access Navigators in the Danville Nephrology Clinic will 
enroll eligible patients into the Vascular Access Navigation and Education Quality Improvement Program  
using a program-developed GHS chronic kidney disease patient registry . Of those patients who are enrolled 
into the Quality Improvement Program, the Vascular Access Navigators will query interest in participating in the Aim [ADDRESS_1189424] potentially eligible patient participants by [CONTACT_756], in -person at a 
previously scheduled, routine clinical appointment using a prepared script, or through a mailed pre -
notification letter. 
 
Provider Participants: Eligible providers will be identified by [CONTACT_854228]. Recruitment will be performed over the telephone , in person, or by [CONTACT_854229]. 
 
Resear ch staff will obtain verbal consent via telephone for research study surveys when preferred by [CONTACT_854230]. For in-person program survey participants, additional study information can be found in 
the written informed consent forms . 
 SUBJECT ENROLLMENT
 
Informed Consent Process Trained study staff at Geisinger will obtain verbal consent over the telephone or written consent in -person prior 
to enrolling participants in the study. For both in-person and telephone consent, the consent process will be reviewed and all will be allowed to ask questions, request time to consider, and refuse at any time prior to or 
post consent. For verbal consent over the telephone, the date and name/initials of the research staff member 
obtaining consent will be documented in the study database. 
 
Geisinger trained research staff obtaining consent will take as much time as needed to explain the study to the participants and answer any questions. Geisinger trained research staff will be available workday/weekend 
hours to answer any questions. Any voice mail messages or emails will be returned in a timely manner.  
Participants will be told they are not required to take part in the study and are offered an opportunity to refuse at any time. Participants are also advised they  can stop their participation in the study at any time. They are also 
told their participation will not affect their care  or employment. 
 
STUDY PROCEDURES
 
Research Design Consented patient and provider participants will complete questionnaires before and after program 
implementation. We will use a pre- and post-assessment design to evaluate the primary and secondary outcomes. We will collect patient and provider data via questionnaires. 
 Sample Size 
4 
 
 We will recruit up to 40 patients and 30-40 providers and staff. 
 
Study procedures 
GHS trained research staff will administer questionnaires to patient and provider/clinic personnel participants. 
We will obtain verbal or written informed consent prior to enrolling participants in the study. Following 
screening, recruitment and consent procedures, trained GHS research staff will administer pre -implementation 
questionnaire questions to participating patients in person (at a previously scheduled, routine clinical 
appointment or at a time and location of their choosing) or over the telephone (Appendix A). Questionnaire 
administration will not disrupt routine clinical care. Similarly, following screening, recruitment and consent 
procedures, trained GHS research staff will administer the pre-implementation questionnaire questions to 
participating providers and clinic personnel at a time that does not interfere with their professional duties  in 
person or over the telephone (Appendix B).  
 
The patient and provider/clinic personnel questionnaire questions will take approximately 10 minutes to 
complete. For both telephone and in person administration of the questionnaires, interviewers will read the 
questions exactly as written and the response choices for each question. Participants may refuse to answer any 
question(s). T he number of incomplete questionnaires  will be monitored.  
 
Patient and provider/personnel participants will also be asked to complete a demographic card ( Appendices C 
& D). Patient demographic information collected will include: sex, age, race, ethnicity, education level, and 
income level. Provider/personnel demographic information collected will include: sex, age, race, ethnicity, 
professional role, time worked in role at Geisinger and total, and time worked with chronic kidney disease 
patients, dialysis patients, and with patients going through the vascular access creation process.  
 
At the conclusion of the quality improvement program, trained GHS research staff will adminis ter the post-
implementation questionnaire questions to participating patients in person (at a previously scheduled, routine 
clinical appointment or at a time and location of their choosing) or over the telephone and to participating 
providers/clinic personnel at a time that does not interfere with their professional duties in person or over the 
telephone. Questionnaire administration will not disrupt routine clinical care.  
 
Remuneration 
There will be no cost to study participants . Patient participants will receive $[ADDRESS_1189425]-implementation questionnaires . Participants electing to terminate the  questionnaire early will receive the 
full amount. A $[ADDRESS_1189426] will be given to patient participants for pre-implementation questionnaires, and a 
$[ADDRESS_1189427]-implementation questionnaires. A compensation letter 
will accompany the remuneration .  
 
DATA ANALYSIS AND POWER 
Data Collection Variables 
See research pre-/post-intervention questionnaires for data collected from patient and providers (Appendices A 
& B).  
Data Collection
 
Table 1 provides an overview of the data to be collected. The outcomes are patient and provider vascular access -related confidence (self - efficacy) and patient vascular access knowledge. Patient confidence will be 
evaluated using a questionnaire with 11 total items (3 research team-developed questions and 8 Perceived Kidney Disease  Self-Management Scale  questions (a validated scale).(7)  Patient knowledge will be evaluated 
using an 8-item research team-developed questionnaire. P rovider confidence will be evaluated by [CONTACT_1629] 11-item 
research team-developed questionnaire.

Data Analysis 
Pre- and post-implementation confidence and knowledge measures scores will be calculated according to 
measure scoring instructions (kidney disease self -management: mean of 8 items ,(7) patient vascular access 
process confidence: mean of 3 items, patient vascular access knowledge: mean of 8 items, provider 
confidence: mean of 11 items). We will use a paired sample student’s t-test to compare pre and post-test 
score means. Analyses will be performed in SAS v9.[ADDRESS_1189429] 
any change in the medical care they receive (patients) or their employers (providers/staff) and that their 
information will not be released to their physicians, employers, healt h care organization, or any other party 
without their permission.  
 
In-person appointments for questionnaire completion will be optional. In cases where a participant chooses to participate in an in- person questionnaire, written informed consent will be obtained at the time of the 
encounter. In cases where a participant prefers to participate in an over -the-telephone questionnaire, verbal 
consent will be obtained.  
 
The main risk is loss of privacy or confidentiality. There is minimal risk of loss of confi dentiality associated 
with participating in any study. Every effort will be made to protect patient and staff confidentiality. Participants will be told we will do all we can to keep their information private. But this cannot be guaranteed 
and that their personal information may be disclosed if required by [CONTACT_2371]. Participant concerns about 
confidentiality will be addressed by [CONTACT_854231]. The nature of the project and its associated risks and benefits will be explained fully to all participants a t the time of recruitment and again at the time of the 
questionnaire administration. No individual will be subjected to any pressure to participate or to answer any questions they may not wish to answer. Participants may stop the questionnaire at any time without sustaining 
adverse consequences.  
 
There is minimal risk of emotional distress. The risk is minimal, however, as the issues covered in the questionnaires are issues often discussed during the course of routine clinical care. There is minimal risk of 
distress when discussing the AV access placement process. However, licensed social workers and physicians employed by [CONTACT_854232]. 
 
POTENTIAL BENEFITS 
Individual: There are minimal anticipated direct benefits to the subjects participating in this study. However, 
participation will provide patients and providers an opportunity to discuss their experience with the vascular 
[ADDRESS_1189430] and engagement in the vascular access creation process. 
Participants will be told that they are helpi[INVESTIGATOR_854223].  
 
Society: The study will provide critical knowledge on the effectiveness of integrated health system quality 
improvement initiatives to improve the care and clinical outcomes of patients with kidney disease. If we find the 
quality improvement initiative is effective, it will provide a model for other health systems to implement. In 
particular, we will identify ways to implement effective health system tools to inform patient ce ntered kidney 
transitions care, and we will identify ways to implement care management and behavioral programs that will improve patients’ transitions to kidney failure.   
 MONITORING AND QUALITY ASSURANCE  
Eligible participants’ information will be kept pri vate and data secure. We will only utilize PHI that is 
absolutely necessary for our identification of potential participa nts’ eligibility for the study. Our study staff are 
trained in research ethics and HIPAA privacy compliance. Study participants’ inform ation will not be released 
to their physicians, employers, health care organization, or any other party without the participants’ permission. 
PHI will not be used or disclosed to any other person or entity, except as required by [CONTACT_2371], for authorized 
oversight of the research study. 
 
All hardcopy study data will be stored in locked file cabinets within research offices and not the clinical sites, as 
well as on secure servers where only study staff have access. No personal identifiers , such as participant names, 
are being collected. All paper and electronic documents will be identified with a unique study ID. All paper documents containing study IDs will be shredded after they are scanned, and saved on the secure server. All 
responses will be kept confidential and stripped of participant identifiers other than unique study IDs.  
 
Telephone contacts to locate the study subject will not suggest the content of the study. All telephone contacts will be made in private offices or within the pr ivate Geisinger research facilities. Only unique patients IDs are 
on hardcopy files. Patients’ data stored on secure servers will not be kept with their identifiable information and only with a unique patient ID. In addition, in -person contact [CONTACT_854233].  
 
GHS research staff will obtain contact [CONTACT_854234] (using a HIPAA waiver) to recruit patients for participation in the pre - and post- implementation questionnaires. Questionnaires 
will be administered by [CONTACT_854235]. Data collected by [CONTACT_854236] a Geisinger REDCap database. REDCap is a secure, web-based, password protected, application 
developed at Vanderbilt University to support data capture for research studies. Duke University and Geisinger 
are active REDCap consortium members.   
ADVERSE EVENTS
 
Ascertainment of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events Adverse events Adverse events will not be collected in this trial since “any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the intervention” will be 
occurring in the course of routine care, not research.

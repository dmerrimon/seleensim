Confidential 11 INTRODUCTION AND STUDY RATIONALE 
1.1  Overview of the Disease 
Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is a subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) accounts for up to 8000 
newly diagnosed NHL cases in US and EU each year1-2.   Its hallmark is the t(11;14)(q13;q32) 
chromosomal translocation of the cyclin D1 gene (CCND1).  This results in overexpression of CCND1 
and increases cell proliferation3.  CCND1 is a regulator of cell cycle and mediates G1 to S phase 
progression4.  Although CCND1 has been found to be over expressed in other tumor types (breast, 
neuroblastoma, pancreas, multiple myeloma), the mechanism of over expression by [CONTACT_941] t(11;14)(q13;32) 
translocation is only found in M CL5.  It has been assumed that CCND1 not only promotes oncogenesis 
but also induces chemoresistance since MCL has a worse prognosis when compared to follicular 
lymphoma or diffuse large B cell lymphoma.  Indeed, standard chemotherapy regimens such as R-CHO P 
that can achieve complete remission (CR) in other NHL can only achieve CR in 34% of MCL6.  Also, 
MCL has a much higher relapse rate even if complete remission can be achieved.  Clinically, MCL 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_149586].  The sites of disease include the lymph nodes, Bone 
marrow, spleen, peripheral blood, and the GI tract.  Patients can present with stage I (13%), stage II (7%), 
stage III (9%), or stage IV (71%).  The median age at presentation is 63 years old, and this disease favors 
men over women at a 3:[ADDRESS_172405] therapeutic regimen for MCL.  One treatment approach is the R-hyperCVAD 
regimen which includes 8 cycles of aggressive chemotherapy. The CR/CRu rate is 87%, the 3 year FFS is 
64%, and recent updates show 5 year FFS of 48%7. The disadvantages of this regimen include high 
toxicity profile, inability of patients to complete the full 8 cycles of therapy (30% of patients did not 
finish), and late relapses occur without a plateau effect.  Another treatment approach is to use autologous 
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AHCT) as consolidation to reduce relapse. The data ranges from 
5 year EFS of 39%, 3 year PFS of 93%, 54 month EFS of 79%, and 5 year EFS of 35%8-12.   The results 
are disappointing since relapses still occur after AHCT.  It is evident that some form of maintenance 
therapy needs to be given to try to prolong the PFS after AHCT.   
 
Bortezomib is a small molecule proteasome inhibitor that can affect multiple signaling pathways.  The 
anti-neoplastic effect of bortezomib likely involves several distinct mechanisms, including inhibition of 
cell growth and survival pathways, induction of apoptosis, and inhibition of expression of genes that 
control cellular adhesion, migration and angiogenesis.  Thus, the mechanisms by [CONTACT_149612], and the extent to which each affected pathway is 
critical to the inhibition of tumor growth could also differ.  Indeed it has been shown to downregulate 
CCND1 expression in MCL in vitro.  It also has activity against MCL as a single agent therapy and is 
FDA approved therapy for relapsed MCL.  See section 1.2 for details on bortezomib. 
 
RITUXAN (rituximab) is a chimeric IgG monoclonal antibody targeting the CD20 surface antigen present 
on both normal lymphocytes and B-cell lymphomas.  The activity of this agent is multi-faceted, in that it 
leads to direct lysis by [CONTACT_149613], 
triggers apoptosis, and may lead to various signaling pathway changes in targeted cells (Cartron 2004).  It 
also appears to act as a chemosensitizer by [CONTACT_149614]-10 binding, leading to decreased intracellular bcl-
2 (Demidem, 1997).  It has been showed to have strong activity in vitro against MCL.  This agent also has

 12/13/[ADDRESS_172406] upfront agent for all Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma.  See 
section 1.3 for details on RITUX AN. 
 
The combination of bortezomib + rituximab has been proven to be efficacious in the in vitro setting in 
MCL cell lines.  Alinari et al. showed that the addition of rituximab to bortezomib activated AKT 
pathways, decreased nuclear NF kappa B levels, induces apoptosis, and causes cell cycle arrest (Alinari 
2009).  There is no true phase I data of combining rituximab and bortezomib.  Both agents have been 
studi
ed extensively in the phase I setting alone.  The toxicities are minimal and many investigators moved 
on to phase II study.  This particular combination also has been tried in Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia 
a
nd marginal zone lymphoma and was found to be safe and efficacious (Ghobrial 2010, de Vos 2009.)  
Dev Vos et al studied this combination in a phase II trial in marginal zone lymphoma.  He actually used a 
higher dose of 1.6 mg/m2 weekly with rituximab 375 mg/m2 weekly.  His study was published in JCO 
2009 
and showed strong efficacy and minimal toxicities.  Ghobrial also used a once week dosing of 1.6 
mg
/m2 weekly with rituximab 375 mg/m2 weekly to treat Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia.  Her study is 
publi
shed in American journal of Hematology [ADDRESS_172407] to use a 
lower dose of 1.3 mg/m2 rather than 1.6 mg/m2. Since rituxan and bortezomib target different pathways 
in MCL, the combination would lead to synergy against tumor resistant pathways.   Also the toxicity 
profiles of these agents are low and relatively non interactive, which makes this combination ideal for 
study in the maintenance setting.

Bortezomib for Injection is a small molecule proteasome inhibitor developed by [CONTACT_149615], Inc., (Millennium) as a novel agent to treat human malignancies. Bortezomib is 
currently approved by [CONTACT_6581] (US FDA) for the treatment of 
patients with multiple myeloma (MM).  It is also indicated for the treatment of patients with mantle cell 
lymphoma (MCL) who have received at least 1 prior therapy.  In the European Union (EU), bortezomib in 
combination with melphalan and prednisone is indicated for the treatment of patients with previously 
untreated MM who are not eligible for high-dose chemotherapy with bone marrow transplant.  
Bortezomib is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of progressive MM in patients who have 
received at least [ADDRESS_172408] is 
critical to the inhibition of tumor growth could also differ.  Bortezomib has a novel pattern of cytotoxicity

Confidential 13 in National Cancer Institute (NCI) in vitro and in vivo assays (Adams et al., 1999).  In addition, 
bortezomib has cytotoxic activity in a variety of xenograft tumor models, both as a single agent and in 
combination with chemotherapy and radiation (Steiner et al., 2001; Teicher et al., 1999; Cusack et al., 
2001; LeBlanc et al., 2002; Pi[INVESTIGATOR_149587]., 2002).  Notably, bortezomib induces apoptosis in cells that over 
express bcl-2, a genetic trait that confers unregulated growth and resistance to conventional 
chemotherapeutics (McConkey et al., 1999). 
 
Bortezomib is thought to be efficacious in multiple myeloma via its inhibition of nuclear factor B (NF-
B) activation, its attenuation of interleukin-6 (IL-6)-mediated cell growth, a direct apoptotic effect, and 
possibly anti-angiogenic and other effects (Hideshima et al., 2001). 
1.2.2 Nonclinical Pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic studies were conducted in the rat and cynomolgus monkey.  
Upon intravenous (IV) bolus administration, bortezomib displays a rapid distribution phase (t½  
<10 minutes) followed by a longer elimination phase (t½  5–15 hours).  Bortezomib has a large volume 
of distribut
ion (range 5–50 L/kg).  The plasma PK profile is well described by a 2-compartment model. 
 
The pharmacodynamic action of bortezomib is well established and can be measured through an ex vivo 
assay (20S proteasome activity) (Lightcap et al., 2000).  This assay was used to determine the duration of 
drug effect in lieu of the PK data in the early preclinical toxicology studies as well as to set a guide for 
dose escalation in humans.  Following dosing with bortezomib in the rat and cynomolgus monkey, 
proteasome inhibition in peripheral blood had a half-life less than 24 hours, with proteasome activity 
returning to pretreatment baseline within 24 hours in monkey and within 48 to 72 hours in rat after a 
single dose of bortezomib.  Further, intermittent but high inhibition (>70%) of proteasome activity was 
better tolerated than sustained inhibition.  Thus, a twice-weekly clinical dosing regimen was chosen in 
order to allow return of proteasome activity towards baseline between dose administrations. 
1.2.3 Nonclinical Toxici ty 
Single-dose IV toxicity studies were conducted with bortezomib in the mouse, rat, dog, and monkey to 
establish the single-dose maximum tolerated dose (MTD).  The MTDs were 0.25 mg/kg (1.5 mg/m2) and 
0.067 mg/kg (0.8 mg/m2) in the [ADDRESS_172409] sensitive species, rat and monkey, respectively. 
Repeat-dose multi-cycle toxicity studies of 3 and 6 months in the rat and 9 months in the monkey, each 
with 8-week recovery periods, were conducted to characterize the chronic toxicity of bortezomib when 
administered by [CONTACT_91820].  The MTD in the 6-month rat study was 
0.10 mg/kg (0.6 mg/m2) and the key target organs were the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, hematopoietic and 
lymphoid systems.  The MTD in the 9-month monkey study was 0.05 mg/kg (0.6 mg/m2) and the key 
target organs were the GI tract, hematopoietic and lymphoid systems, peripheral nervous system, and 
kidney.  Full or partial reversibility was observed for each of the toxicities described to date.   
 
In general, the nature of the toxicity of bortezomib is similar across species, and target organs of toxicity 
in animals have been largely predictive of human toxicity.  The toxicity of bortezomib in animals is 
characterized by a steep dose-response with mortality seen at dosages above the MTD.  The cause of

Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc.                                                          
 12/13/[ADDRESS_172410] cardiovascular (CV) effects of 
hypotension and vascular changes with secondary bradycardia and the cause of death in long-term studies 
has been attributed to GI or hematologic toxicity.  The pharmacologic effects of bortezomib on the CV 
system have been extensively characterized and have demonstrated that indirect effects on CV function 
occur only at acutely lethal dosages and are abrogated by [CONTACT_91821]. 
Additional detailed information regarding the nonclinical pharmacology and toxicology of bortezomib 
may be found in the 2006 Investigator’s Brochure 
1.2.4 Clinical Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics 
The clinical pharmacology characterization of bortezomib has been determined from phase 1 studies in 
subj
ects with solid tumors and hematological malignancies, and confirmed in phase 2 studies in subjects 
with multiple myeloma. 
 
B
ortezomib demonstrates multi-compartmental pharmacokinetics. Following intravenous administration 
of 1.0 mg/m2 and 1.3 mg/m2 dose, the mean first-dose maximum observed plasma concentrations of 
bortezomib were 57 and 112 ng/mL, respectively in 11 patients with multiple myeloma and creatinine 
clearance values >50 mL/min participating in a pharmacokinetics study.  In subsequent doses, mean 
maximum observed plasma concentrations ranged from 67 to 106 ng/mL for the 1.0 mg/m2 dose and 89 to 
120 ng/mL for the 1.3 mg/m2 dose.  The mean elimination half-life of bortezomib upon multiple dosing 
ranged from [ADDRESS_172411] dose.  Mean 
Tota
l Body Clearances were 102 and 112 L/h following the first dose for doses of 1.0 mg/m2 and 1.3 
mg/m2, respectively, and ranged from 15 to 32 L/h following subsequent doses for doses of 1.0 and 
1.3 mg/m2, respectively.  Clinical experience has shown that the change in clearance does not result in 
overt toxicity from accumulation in this multidose regimen in humans. 
In subjects with advanced malignancies, the maximum pharmacodynamic effect (inhibition of 20S 
activity) occurred within 1-hour post dose.  At the therapeutic dose of 1.3 mg/m2 in subjects with multiple 
myeloma, the mean proteasome inhibition at 1-hour post dose was approximately 61%. 
 
The time course of proteasome inhibition in subjects is characterized by [CONTACT_149616], followed by [CONTACT_91824] 
6 
to 24 hours to within 50% of the pretreatment activity.  On the Day 1, 4, 8, and 11 schedule, variable 
(10%–30%) levels of proteasome inhibition have been observed at next scheduled dosing.   In theory, this 
advantage allows cells to recover proteasome activity for normal cellular housekeepi[INVESTIGATOR_149588]. 
 
The relationship between bortezomib plasma concentrations and proteasome inhibition can be described 
by a maximum effect (E max) model.  The E max curve is initially very steep, with small changes in plasma 
bortezomib concentration over the range of 0.5 to 2.0 ng/mL relating to large increases in the percent 
inhibition (0–60%).  After that, a plateau occurs where marginal increases of proteasome inhibition are

 12/13/[ADDRESS_172412] been treated with bortezomib, 
including patients treated through Millennium-sponsored clinical trials, Investigator-Initiated Studies, the 
US NCI Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP), and with commercially available drug.  
Bortezomib has been commercially available since 13 May 2003. 
The overall goal of the Millennium phase 1 program was to determine the MTD and dose-limiting 
toxicity (DLT) of bortezomib in a number of therapeutic settings involving subjects with various 
advanced malignancies.  In a phase 1 trial in patients with refractory hematologic malignancies, the MTD 
for a twice weekly dosing for 4 weeks of a 42-day cycle was 1.04 mg/m2/dose, with DLTs of 
thromboc
ytopenia, hyponatremia, hypokalemia, fatigue, and malaise.[ADDRESS_172413] and fourth weeks of therapy.  In the 3-week schedule of bortezomib monotherapy (4 doses, given 
on Days 1, 4, 8, and 11 of a 21-day treatment cycle), the DLT occurred at 1.56 mg/m2/dose (3 subjects 
with 
Grade 3 diarrhea and 1 with peripheral sensory neuropathy).  Therefore, the MTD at this schedule 
was 1.3 mg/m2/dose.  In a 35-day treatment cycle with 4 weekly doses of bortezomib monotherapy, the 
MTD was 1.6 mg/m2/dose and DLT included hypotension, tachycardia, diarrhea, and syncope. 
In phase 1 clinical studies, antitumor activity was reported in subjects with Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma 
(NHL), MM, Waldenström’s Macroglobulinemia, squamous cell carcinoma of the nasopharynx, 
bronchoalveolar carcinoma of the lung, renal cell carcinoma, and prostate cancer.2,3,4,5 
The safety and efficacy of bortezomib in subjects with MM were investigated in two phase 2 clinical 
studies, studies M34100-024 (subjects with first relapse)6 and M34100-025 (subjects with second or 
greater relapse and refractory to their last prior therapy).[ADDRESS_172414] 2 previous treatments received bortezomib, 1.3 mg/m2 on Days 1, 4, 8, 
and 11 of a 21-day treatment cycle.  The European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplant (EBMT) 
response criteria, as described by [CONTACT_149617]8 were utilized to determine disease response.  Complete responses 
(CRs) were observed in 4% of subjects, with an additional 6% of patients meeting all criteria for CR but 
having a positive immunofixation test.  Partial response (PR) or better was observed in 27% of subjects, 
and the overall response rate (CR, PR, and minor response [MR] combined) was 35%.  Seventy percent of 
subjects experienced stable disease or better. 
The phase 3 study (M34101-039)9, also referred to as the APEX study, was designed to determine 
whether bortezomib provided benefit (time to progression [TTP], response rate, and survival) to patients 
with relapsed or refractory MM relative to treatment with high-dose dexamethasone.  The study was also 
designed to determine the safety and tolerability of bortezomib relative to high-dose dexamethasone, and 
whether treatment with bortezomib was associated with superior clinical benefit and quality of life 
relative to high-dose dexamethasone.  A total of 669 patients were enrolled and 663 patients received 
study drug (bortezomib:  331; dexamethasone:  332).  Patients randomized to bortezomib received 1.3 
mg/m2 IV push twice weekly on Days 1, 4, 8, and 11 of a 3-week cycle for up to 8 treatment cycles as 
induction therapy, followed by 1.3-mg/m2 bortezomib weekly on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of a 5-week cycle 
for 3 cycles as maintenance therapy.  Patients randomized to dexamethasone received oral dexamethasone 
40 mg once daily on Days 1 to 4, 9 to 12, and 17 to 20 of a 5-week cycle for up to 4 treatment cycles as

Confidential 16 induction therapy, followed by [CONTACT_149618] 40 mg once daily on Days 1 to 4 of a 4-week cycle for 
5 cycles as maintenance therapy.  The EBMT response criteria were utilized to determine disease 
response.  There was a 78% increase in TTP for the bortezomib arm.  Median TTP was 6.2 months for the 
bortezomib arm and 3.5 months for the dexamethasone arm (p < 0.0001).  CR + PR was 38% with 
bortezomib versus 18% with dexamethasone (p  0.0001).  CR was 6% with bortezomib versus  1% 
with dexamethasone (p < 0.0001).  The CR + nCR (near CR) rate was 13% with bortezomib versus 2% 
with dexamethasone.  In patients who had received only 1 prior line of treatment (bortezomib:  132; 
dexamethasone:  119), CR + PR was 45% with bortezomib vs 26% with dexamethasone (p = 0.0035).  
With a median 8.3 months of follow-up, overall survival was significantly longer (p = 0.0013) for patients 
on 
the bortezomib arm versus patients on the dexamethasone arm.  The probability of survival at 1 year 
was 80% for the bortezomib arm versus 66% for the dexamethasone arm, which represented a 41% 
decreased relative risk of death in the first year with bortezomib (p = 0.0005).  In patients who had 
re
ceived only 1 prior line of treatment, the probability of survival at 1 year was 89% for the bortezomib 
arm versus 72% for the dexamethasone arm, which represented a 61% decreased relative risk of death in 
the first year with bortezomib (p = 0.0098).  Updated response rates and survival data were reported for 
M34101-039.10  The updated CR + PR rate was 43% with bortezomib.   The CR + nCR rate was 16% with 
bortezomib.  With a median 22 months of follow-up, overall survival was significantly longer for patients 
on 
the bortezomib arm versus patients on the dexamethasone arm.  The median overall survival was 
29.8 months (95% CI:   23.2, not estimable) for the bortezomib arm vs 23.7 months (95% CI:  18.7, 29.1) 
for the dexamethasone arm (hazard ratio = 0.77, p = 0.0272).  The probability of survival at 1 year was 
80%
 for the bortezomib arm versus 67% for the dexamethasone arm (p = 0.0002). 
The
 safety and efficacy of bortezomib in relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) were 
investigated in an international, phase 2, multicenter study M34103-053, also referred to as the 
PI[INVESTIGATOR_91782].11  The single-arm study was designed to evaluate the response rates, duration of 
response (DOR), TTP, overall survival (OS), and safety of bortezomib treatment in patients with relapsed 
or refractory mantle cell lymphoma.  For 141 evaluable patients, the response rate was 31% (8% 
CR/unconfirmed CR [Cru]).  Median time to response was 40 days (range 31-204 days).  The median 
number of cycles administered across all patients was 4; in responding patients, the median number of 
cycles was 8.  The median DOR by [CONTACT_91825] 9.2 months and 13.5 months in patients with CR/CRu.  
Me
dian TTP for both groups was 6.[ADDRESS_172415] commonly reported adverse events (AEs) were fatigue, peripheral 
neuropathy, and gastrointestinal events.  A time- to-event update to the PI[INVESTIGATOR_91782]12 was reported 
after a median follow-up of 26.4 months.  TTP was 6.7 months for all patients, 12.4 months in all 
responders.  The median DOR was 9.2 months in all responders and had not been reached in patients 
achieving CR/Cru.  Overall survival was 23.5 months in all patients and 36 months in patients with 
C
R/Cru.  Survival at 12 months was 69% overall and 91% in responding patients. 
The phase 3 study (MMY 3002) known as the VISTA study, evaluated the safety and efficacy of the 
combination of bortezomib, melphalan, and prednisone in previously untreated multiple myeloma patients 
who were not candidates for stem cell transplant.13  The study was designed to determine the benefit of 
adding bortezomib to MP (melphalan and prednisone) as assessed by [CONTACT_91826].  Patients (682) were

during Cycles 1 to 4, and on Days 1, 8, 22, and 29 during Cycles 5 to 9.  Response was evaluated every 3 
weeks using the EBMT criteria.  At a preplanned interim analysis, the independent data monitoring 
committee recommended that the study be stopped since the prespecified statistical boundary end point of 
TTP had been crossed.  Response rates were 30% with 4% CR.  The rates of partial response or better 
were 71% in the bortezomib (VMP) group compared to 34% in the MP group (p = 0.001).  With follow-
up 
of 16.3 months, the TTP for the VMP group was 24 months compared to 16.6 months in the MP group 
(p = 0.000001) and was associated with a 52% reduced time to progression.  The median DOR was 19.9 
months in the VMP group and 13.1 months in the MP group.  Overall survival had not been reached in 
either group.  Hematologic toxicity was similar in both groups.  The incidence of peripheral sensory 
neuropathy and gastrointestinal symptoms was higher in the VMP group.  The incidence of herpes zoster 
was 3% in patients in the VMP group who received antiviral prophylaxis.  Fifteen percent of patients in 
the VMP group discontinued therapy due to AEs compared to 14% in the MP group. 
The VISTA study update after extended follow-up of 25.9 months,14 confirmed a survival benefit for the 
VMP group.  Overall survival was not reached in either group:  VMP group (75) deaths, 3 year OS 72%; 
MP group (111) deaths, 3 year OS 59% (p = 0.0032).  Patients on VMP were less likely to start second-
li
ne therapy (VMP 38% vs MP 57% at the time of data cut-off) with a longer time to next therapy (TNT) 
and treatment free interval (TFI).  Of the MP patients who received subsequent therapy, 43% went on to 
receive bortezomib.  
Based on investigator-reported best responses to subsequent therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], patients relapsing after therapy 
with a novel agent were not intrinsically more resistant than after receiving a traditional agent. 
In the VISTA study, VMP was associated with prolonged TTP, TNT, TFI, and OS.  Patients were 
successfully treated with subsequent IMiD-based therapy and retreated with bortezomib.  After 36.7 
months follow-up, OS continued to be superior for VMP.  The OS for VMP had not yet been reached

1.2.7 Subcutaneous administration of  Bortezomib  
 
Subcutaneous administration of has been investigated in two clinical trials in MM (multiple myeloma), 
including MMY-3021, a phase III, randomized, open-label, prospective study of subcutaneous (SC) vs. 
intravenous (IV) administration of bortezomib in patients with relapsed MM.  Subcutaneous 
administration of bortezomib has not been approved by [CONTACT_1622].

Confidential 23 Moreau et al published a phase I trial of SC vs. IV bortezomib in relapsed MM in Hematologicae 2008. 
93(12):1908-11.  This trial showed the response rate was similar between the IV vs. SC arm and area 
under the curve was also similar.    
 
In 2008, Moreau et al. first described the subcutaneous administration of bortezomib in a group of 
patients with multiple myeloma (MM).  At the 2010 annual meeting of the American Society of 
Hematology (ASH), this group presented data from a phase III randomized controlled trial comparing 
intravenous and subcutaneous routes of administration of bortezomib with or without dexamethasone in 
patients with MM. Randomized, Phase 3 study compared the efficacy and safety of subcutaneous versus 
intravenous bortezomib at the approved 1·3 mg/m(2) dose and twice per week schedule in patients with 
relapsed multiple myeloma. 222 patients were randomly assigned to receive subcutaneous (n=148) or 
intravenous (n=74) bortezomib. The response-evaluable population consisted of 145 patients in the 
subcutaneous group and 73 in the intravenous group.Patients received a median of eight cycles (range one 
to ten) in both groups.  
ORR after four cycles was 42% in both groups (61 patients in subcutaneous group and 31 in intravenous 
group; ORR difference -0·4%, 95% CI -14·3 to 13·5), showing non-inferiority (p=0·002). After a median 
follow-up of 11·8 months (IQR 7·9-16·8) in the subcutaneous group and 12·0 months (8·1-15·6) in the 
intravenous group, there were no significant differences in time to progression (median 10·4 months, 95% 
CI 8·5-11·7, vs 9·4  months, 7·6-10·6; p=0·387) and 1-year overall survival (72·6%, 95% CI 63·1-80·0, 
vs 76·7%, 64·1-85·4; p=0·504) with subcutaneous versus intravenous bortezomib.  
Grade 3 or worse adverse events were reported in 84 (57%) patients in the subcutaneous group versus 52 
(70%) in the intravenous group; the most common were thrombocytopenia (19 [13%] vs 14 [19%]), 
neutropenia (26 [18%] vs 13 [18%]), and anaemia (18 [12%] vs six [8%]). Peripheral neuropathy of any 
grade (56 [38%] vs 39 [53%]; p=0·044), grade 2 or worse (35 [24%] vs 30 [41%]; p=0·012), and grade 3 
or worse (nine [6%] vs 12 [16%]; p=0·026) was significantly less common with subcutaneous than with 
intravenous administration. Subcutaneous administration was locally well tolerated.  
Subcutaneous bortezomib offered non-inferior efficacy to standard intravenous administration, with an 
improved safety profile.

1.3  RITUXIMAB (rituximab) for Injection 
1.3.1 Scientific background:   
Rituximab is a chimeric IgG monoclonal antibody targeting the CD20 surface antigen present on both 
normal lymphocytes and B-cell lymphomas.  The activity of this agent is multi-faceted, in that it leads to 
direct lysis by [CONTACT_149613], triggers 
apoptosis, and may lead to various signaling pathway changes in targeted cells (Cartron 2004).  It also 
appears to act as a chemosensitizer by [CONTACT_149614]-10 binding, leading to decreased intracellular bcl-2 
(Demidem, 1997).  This suggests that rituximab may synergize with bortezomib.  It is reasonable to 
combine the two agents, bortezomib and rituximab, in MCL.   
This 
combination has already been used in previous phase II trials for relapsed MCL with good results.  It 
was well tolerated for MCL patients.   
1.3.2 Pharmacology: 
Kinetics:  In prior studies patients treated at the 375mg/m2 dose levels exhibited detectable antibody 
concentrations throughout the treatment period.  Most patients exhibited increasing pre-infusion antibody 
concentrations with each subsequent infusion.  In nine patients, the T1/[ADDRESS_172423] antibody 
infusion was 59.8 hours (11.1-104.6 hr) with a C max of 271g/ml.  Following the fourth antibody infusion 
whe
n circulating B cells had been depleted and antigentic sites coated, the T1/2 was 174 hrs (26.4-442.3 
hr) and C max 496.7 g/ml.

1. I nfusion related symptoms: Fever, chills, rigors, hypotension, anaphylaxis or hypersensitivity 
reactions, arrhy thmia, dyspnea, bronchospasm, angioedema.  In rare cases, severe and fatal 
cardiopulmonary events, including hypoxia, pulmonary infiltrates, acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_13086], myocardial infarction, and cardiogenic shock, have occurred.  (4-7/10,000 patients 
or 0.04-0.07%).  Nearly all fatal infusion-related events occurred in association with the first 
infusion.  Patients with pre-existing cardiac conditions, including arrhythmia and angina, have 
had recurrences of these cardiac events during rituximab infusions. 
2. Gastrointestinal: Nausea, vomiting. 
3. Hematologic: Leukopenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia.  In clinical trials, NCI CTC Grade 3 and 
4 cytopenias were reported in 48% of patients treated with rituximab; these include: 
lymphopenia (40%), neutropenia (6%), leucopenia (4%), anemia (3%), and thrombocytopenia 
(2%). The median duration of lymphopenia was 14 days (range, 1 to 588 days) and of 
neutropenia was 13 days (range, 2-116 days).   A single occurrence of transient aplastic anemia 
(pure red cell aplasia) and two occurrences of hemolytic anemia following rituximab therapy 
was reported.

susceptibility to other infections.  Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation with fulminant 
hepatitis, hepatic failure, and death has been reported in some patients with hematologic 
malignancies treated with rituximab.  The majority of patients received rituximab in 
combination with chemotherapy.  The median time to diagnosis of hepatitis was approximately 
four months after the initiation of rituximab and approximately one month after the last dose. 
 
1.4  Study rationale and selection of drug doses 
Doses of RITUXAN given is 375 mg/m2 give weekly x [ADDRESS_172425] maintenance dosing regimen used for follicular lymphoma and for mantle cell lymphoma.   
Doses of bortezomib given is 1.3 mg/m2 weekly x 4 weeks given every 3 month x 8 cycles.  Doses of 1.3 
mg/m2 is based on prior pharmacokinetics study.  Dosing schedule is changed from D1, 4, 8, [ADDRESS_172426] also combined bortezomib + RITUXAN and 
proved no additional toxicities13-14.  We have chosen to use the subcutaneous route of administration 
instead of intravenous route because of increased convenience for patients (this is a maintenance study 
and patients will likely prefer subcutaneous administration due to less time spent in clinic).  Also based on 
the ASH 2010 presentation there appears to be less grade > 3 AEs and peripheral neuropathy associated 
with SC administration.

Confidential 27 3 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN 
  3.1 Overall Design and Plan of the Study 
This is an open label, phase II study of maintenance bortezomib + RITUXAN in patients with mantle cell 
lymphoma s/p autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AHCT).  Patients must have achieved 
engraftment by D60-180 as evidenced by [CONTACT_58846] >1000 and Plt > 80K.  Patients also must not have greater 
than 
grade [ADDRESS_172427]/PET scan, and by [CONTACT_36087].  Patients will then start treatment with bortezomib + 
RITUXAN as maintenance therapy within D60-D180 after AHCT.  Bortezomib will be given at a d ose of 
1.3 mg/m2 on D1, 8, 15, 22 in a 28 day period every 3 months for a total of 8 cycles.  RITUXAN will be 
given at dose of 375 mg/m2 on D1, 8, 15, 22 in a 28 day period every 6 months for a total of 4 cycles.   
The
 primary efficacy endpoint of this study is two year disease free survival.  This is a phase II efficacy 
trial.  Response will be assessed according to modified criteria for malignant lymphoma, based on 
(Cheson et al 1999) and (Cheson, et al 2007).  For the 1st two years of treatment, assessments will be 
performed at every cycle.  After treatment period, assessments will be performed every 6 months for three 
additional years. Patients will then undergo end of treatment assessment at year five.  Clinical suspi[INVESTIGATOR_149592] a physical examination and radiological confirmation to be

Bortezomib Administration 
 
Intravenous and subcutaneous route of administration have different reconstituted concentration. 
Caution should be used when calculating the volume to be administered. 
 
 
SUBCUTANEOUS ADMINISTRATION 
 
Drug is available in sterile, single use vials containing 3.5 mg of bortezomib.  Each vial of bortezomib for 
I
njection should be reconstituted under a laminar flow biological cabinet (hood) within eight hours before 
dosing with 1.4 mL  of normal (0.9%) saline, Sodium Chloride Injection USP, so that the reconstituted 
solution contains bortezomib at a concentration of 2.5 mg/mL  for subcutaneous administration.   
 
S
ubcutaneous Administration Precautions 
 The  drug quantity contained in one vial (3.5 mg) may exceed the usual dose required.  Caution 
shoul
d be used in calculating the dose to prevent overdose.  
 W hen administered subcutaneously, sites for each injection (thigh or abdomen) should be rotated.   
 Ne w injections should be given at least one inch from an old site and never into areas where the 
site is tender, bruised, erythematous, or indurated. 
 
 If local injection site reactions occur following bortezomib administration subcutaneously, a less 
concentrated bortezomib solution (1 mg/mL instead of 2.5 mg/mL) may be administered 
subcutaneously.  Alternatively, the IV route of administration should be considered. 
 In clinical trials of bortezomib IV, local skin irritation was reported in 5% of patients, but 
extravasation of  bortezomib was not associated with tissue damage. In a clinical trial of 
subcutaneous bortezomib, a local reaction was reported in 6% of patients as an adverse event, 
mostly redness.

The neurotoxicity-directed questionnaire (see section 8.7) is a useful tool for determining the presence 
and intensity of neuropathic pain and/or peripheral neuropathy from the patient’s perspective.  
Neuropathic symptoms are more prominent than abnormalities on the clinical examination.  After the 
patient completes the neurotoxicity-directed questionnaire, the questionnaire should be reviewed to assist 
with the evaluation of the onset and intensity of peripheral neuropathy and other neurotoxicities that may 
possibly require intervention or dose modification. 
 
Patients with mild hepatic impairment (bilirubin ≤ 1.5  ULN) do not require a starting dose adjustment.  
Please note that patients with bilirubin levels > 1.[ADDRESS_172441] are excluded from enrollment in this protocol.  If 
a patient develops moderate or severe hepatic impairment with bilirubin ≥ Grade 2 ( > 1.[ADDRESS_172442]) 
while on study, the investigator should hold Bortezomib until the toxicity returns to < Grade 2. Restarting 
Bortezomib at the next lower dosed level could be considered at the Investigator’s discretion and 
following exclusion of Bortezomib-induced liver impairment and careful consideration of liver disease 
due to other causes, such as, but not limited to, active infection and multiple myeloma-related liver

peripheral blood.  Although MCL is the only lymphoma that expresses CCND1, normal tissues 
such as GI tract can also produce CCND1 mRNA.  It has not been used as an early marker for 
relapse due to background noise from normal tissue.  In this study, we hope to evaluate the 
expression of CCND1 mRNA in the bone marrow and peripheral blood longitutionally from serial 
measurements.  We hope to correlate an increase in CCND1 mRNA from baseline with relapse.

  4.1  Sample Size Estimation 
The aim of this study is to examine the anti-tumor activity/efficacy of this maintenance regimen in 
eligible patients. The City of Hope historical rate of DFS is 60%, which is a consistent with what is 
reported in literature.  This is an efficacy study.  We expect a disease-free survival rate (DFS) (primary 
endpoint) to improve by 20% with this maintenance therapy.  To achieve a DFS of 80% at two years, we 
need a sample size of 36 evaluable patients. (alpha=0.05, 1-beta=0.80).  With adequate follow-up time, 
the endpoints of DFS, overall survival (OS), and time to treatment failure will be assessed by [CONTACT_5263]-
Meier survival analysis and 95% confidence intervals will be calculated using Greenwood’s formula.  
Based on the current referral patterns to the City of Hope, it is expected that approximately 5 patients per

The
 toxicities observed will be summarized in terms of type (e.g. organ affected or ANC) severity  (by 
[CONTACT_4652] v4.0  and nadir or maximum values for the laboratory measures), date of onset, duration, 
reversibility, and attribution. Tables will be created to summarize these toxicities and side effects. 
Baseline information (e.g., the extent of prior therapy) and demographic information will be presented for 
all study patients.  
 
In accordance with the primary study objectives, we will perform descriptive statistical analyses on these 
data after the study is complete. With adequate follow-up time, the endpoints of DFS, overall survival 
(OS), and time to treatment failure will be assessed by [CONTACT_5263]-Meier survival analysis and 95% 
confidence intervals will be calculated using Greenwood’s formula. DFS will be defined as the time from 
first treatment day until objective or symptomatic relapse or death as a result of lymphoma or acute 
toxicity of treatment. OS will be defined as the time from first treatment day until death.   
4.5  Protocol Deviations 
  4.5.1 Deviation Policy 
Brief interruptions and delays may occasionally be required due to travel delays, airport closure, 
inclement weather, family responsibilities, security alerts, government holidays, etc.  This can also extend 
to complications of disease or unrelated medical illnesses not related to disease progression.  These delays 
of up to three days will not be considered protocol deviations. 
 
Planned deviations may be permitted in accordance with the COH policy on “Clinical Research Protocol 
Planned Deviations and Single Subject Exception.”  These planned deviations, considered Single Subject 
Exceptions, are considered an Amendment to the Protocol.  In addition, if contractually obligated, the 
sponsor must also approve any planned deviations.

Adverse Event - Adverse event (AE) means any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or subject 
administered a pharmaceutical product; the untoward medical occurrence does not necessarily have a 
causal relationship with this treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a 
medicinal (investigational) product whether or not it is related to the medicinal product.  This includes 
any newly occurring event, or a previous condition that has increased in severity or frequency since the 
administration of study drug.

Confidential 51 For this protocol an abnormal laboratory value will not be assessed as an AE unless that value leads to 
discontinuation or delay in treatment, dose modification, therapeutic intervention, or is considered by [CONTACT_149630] a clinically significant change from baseline. 
 
 
Serious Adverse Event –  
S
erious adverse event (SAE) means any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
 R esults in death. 
 Is life-threatening (refers to an AE in which the patient was at risk of death at the time of the 
event.  It does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more 
severe). 
 R equires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1324]. 
 Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity.  (Disability is defined as a substantial 
disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions). 
 Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
 I s a medically important event.  This refers to an AE that may not result in death, be immediately 
life threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but may be considered serious when, based on 
appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the patient, require medical or surgical intervention 
to prevent one of the outcomes listed above, or involves suspected transmission via a medicinal 
product of an infectious agent.    
o Ex amples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive 
treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not 
result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
o With respect to the suspected transmission via a medicinal product of an infectious agent; 
any organism, virus, or infectious particle (e.g., prion protein transmitting Transmissible 
Spongiform Encephalopathy), whether pathogenic or non-pathogenic, is considered an 
infectious agent.   
Clarification should be made between the terms serious  and severe  because they ARE NOT the same.  
The term severe  is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event (as in mild, moderate, 
or severe myocardial infarction); the event itself, however, may be of relatively minor medical

Confidential 52 significance (such as a severe headache).  This is NOT the same as serious , which is based on 
patient/event outcome or action criteria described above and is usually associated with events that pose a 
threat to a patient’s life or functioning.  A severe AE does not necessarily need to be considered serious.  
For example, persistent nausea of several hours duration may be considered severe nausea but may not be 
considered an SAE.  On the other hand, a stroke resulting in only a minor degree of disability may be 
considered mild but would be defined as an SAE based on the above noted criteria.  Seriousness (not 
severity) serves as a guide for defining regulatory reporting obligations. 
 
Safety Reporting Requirements and Timelines – Participating Sites 
The
 guideline is to provide a procedure for accurate and timely reporting of unanticipated problems 
and/or adverse events meeting reporting criteria as defined in Section 5.2 of this protocol for 
participating sites.  The participating site, including the participating Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or 
stud
y coordinators are responsible for reporting all unanticipated problems and/or adverse events 
immediately (within 24 hours after learning of the event) to their local IRB, the Principal 
Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_149607], and the Data Coordinating Center at COH. 
The participating Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_149608]/or adverse event, 
regardless of attribution, to the City of Hope Principal Investigator, [CONTACT_149635] and to the 
Data Coordinating Center at City of Hope within 24 hours of learning of the occurrence. In the 
event that the participating site Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or staff does not become aware of the 
unanticipated problem and/or adverse event immediately (e.g., participant sought treatment 
elsewhere), the participating site is to report the event within [ADDRESS_172469] awareness of the unanticipated problem and/or adverse 
event.    
Report to City of Hope all unanticipated problems and/or serious adverse events (meeting criteria as 
defined in Section 5.2) by [CONTACT_756] (to [CONTACT_149635] and the DCC) and send via scan/email 
and fax a copy of the following forms: 
 Notific ation of Unanticipated Problem/Serious Adverse Event Form (located at end of the

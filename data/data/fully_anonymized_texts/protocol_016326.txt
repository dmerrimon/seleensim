Cognitive Training for Diabetes Self -Management  
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
March 30, [ADDRESS_443041] will be conducted with 66 adults  with T2DM to evaluate the efficacy of the 
MAPSS -DM intervention to improve the primary outcome of overall cognitive function  (e.g. verbal memory 
performance, use of cognitive strategies) and DM -SM. Drs. Cuevas and Stuifbergen completed a feasibility 
study of the intervention  using a one group pre -test post -test design .[ADDRESS_443042] desig n with longer follow -up.   
Mechanisms to Improve Rigor . The proposed study  will reduce bias by 1:[ADDRESS_443043] ete checklists after each class . 
Strateg ies for monitoring receipt of t reatment (e.g. time spent online , weekly goals) will be used.   
Intervention Description .  The intervention is composed of 4 small -group webinar classes and home -based 
individual  online  cognitive skills practice . The f our small -group 2 -hr web -based classes  are held  over 8 weeks. 
Classes 1 & 2  will focus on common cognitive problems in T2DM and strategies to improve cognitive skills. 
Classes 3 & 4 focus on  lifestyle changes to support cognitive functioning and DM -SM skills. Each online class 
will follow the same format : (1) introduction/revisiting content from the previous class and answering questions; 
(2) review of progress on the computer exercises; (3) practicing cognitive strategies i n cla ss; and (4) content 
on weekly topic . The facilitator will review participants’ progress on the computer exercises, explore cognitive 
strategies and difficulties with performance, and prescribe exercises for the following week s. Each participant 
will receive a workbook that reemphasizes class content.  Intervention fidelity will be increased through use of 
the intervention manual (tested in PS#2 ) to ensure all content is covered. The interventionist will be trained by 
[CONTACT_978], and will complete a self -assessment checklist after each class to verify content covered.  
Computer Training Component . The computer -training component, developed by [CONTACT_83026], uses a model 
for cognitive training that adapts to the user through an integrated hierarchical structure.[ADDRESS_443044] time 
logged on.  BrainHQ meets the Institute of Medicine’s five requirements for a brain -training program: (1) 
transferability to other tested tasks; (2) transfer ability  to real -world tasks; (3) evaluation with active control 
group with access to same product ; (4) retention of trained skills; and (5) replication of findings .51 The 
intervention group will be asked to practice 20 minutes, 7 days a week.  
Comparison Group . Those  randomized to the comparison group will receive a referral to the BrainHQ website. 
A specific amount of practice will not be prescribed, but participants’ times and dates of practice will be 
downloaded from the website. Participants will receive a weekly phone call to maintain connection to the study, 
but no other intervention. Data  collection will be on the same schedule as the intervention group.  
Sample  and Setting.  People with T2DM will be recruited from [LOCATION_007] Diabetes & Endocrinology (TDE ) that  
oversees the health care of over 3500  patients  with T2DM  per year (see letter of support) . About 75% of TDE’s 
patients are female, 36% Hispanic, and 3% African American. [CONTACT_355607]  has worked with TDE in prior 
studies . Information about the study will be provided to patients by [CONTACT_355593]. Recruitment materials will instruct participants to call or emai l the PI [INVESTIGATOR_355588].  
Power analysis.  Using data from our preliminary study, a p ower  analysis was run to estimate sample size for 
the outcome s of decreased A1C, improved cognitive function (i.e. working memory, executive function)  using 
G*Power. For a fully powered randomized trial, assuming a small -to-moderate effect size of d = .3, each group 
would need [ADDRESS_443045] sizes. Hertzog has s hown that 10 –[ADDRESS_443046] sizes.49 Allowing for a 10% attri tion rate (based 
on PS#2 ), 66 persons with T2DM (33 intervention and 33 control ) will be recruited.  
Recruitment  & Enrollment . Inclusion criteria: age 45 -70 years old, T2DM diagnosis fo r 2 years, access to 
phone and I nternet, Score of ≥10 on the Perceived Deficits Questionnaire  (PDQ) , and an A1C of >7%.50 
Exclusion criteria: a diagnosis of dementia/head injury, score of >[ADDRESS_443047] in participating in the study, a screening assessment 
will be done either in person or by [CONTACT_648]. A script of questions to verify that pote ntial participants meet the 
inclusion/exclusion criteria  will be followed . Participants will be asked the PDQ items that assess  self-perceived 
cognitive difficulties, with questions such as “How often do you lose your train of thought when speaking?” 
using a 5 -point scale ranging from 1 = never to 5 = almost always.[ADDRESS_443048] 5 areas to participate. The Mini-Cog will screen potential 
participants for dementia.51 A total sc ore of ≤5 indicates lower likelihood of dementia. For those who meet the 
inclusion criteria and agree to participate, a meeting will be scheduled at a time and private location convenient 
to the participant. Eligible  participants will meet with a  GRA or PI, who will review the study’s purpose and 
procedures, answe r participants’ questions, obtain signed consent forms , and collect baseline data.  
Randomization.  Seven  cohorts of 10 subjects will be recruited  during the study, and subjects in the cohort will 
be randomly assigned 1:[ADDRESS_443049] of random 
numbers (following baseline testing). The intervention group will be further divided into class sizes of 10 -5 
participants. In prior cognitive rehabilitation studies, small intervention class sizes (n=10 -12) enhanced self -
efficacy through vicarious experience and modeling.[ADDRESS_443050] been sh own to be effective .52-54 
Data Collection . Questionnaire data will be collected from all participants  on an iPad and entered into 
REDCap at baseline  (week 0) , at completion of the intervention  (week  10), and at  [ADDRESS_443051] -intervention  
(week 22) . A GRA who is blind to group assignment  will administer the instruments and neruopsych tests in a 
private location to ensure completion, confidentiality, and privacy. Clinical variables will be gathered by [CONTACT_355594]: current medications, past A1C levels, and co -morbidities. The total data colle ction time will be 
about 60 min. Participants will receive a small incentive ($25) for completing the first two data collections and 
($50) for the final assessment ($100 total). Data will be downloaded for analysis into IBM SPSS Statistics 
version 23.55 All intervention participants will be invited to join a focus group after their final data collection to 
evaluate their perceptions of the acceptability of the MAPSS -DM intervention.

illustrated objects and activities presented in a particular order on the computer screen. 
Participants are asked to recall the sequence of pi[INVESTIGATOR_355590]. Participants are given credit for each adjacent pair of pi[INVESTIGATOR_499] (i.e., if pi[INVESTIGATOR_355591] 7 and 8 and placed in that order and adjacent to each other any where – such as 
slots 1 and 2 – one point is awarded) they correctly place, up to  the maximum value for the

Glucose Variability. Participants will wear CGMS devices for one  week at specific intervals  (week 0 , week 5 , 
week 11 , and week 22 ). Abbott ’s FreeStyle Libre CGMS  consists  of a small, round sensor  about  the size of two 
stacked U.S. quarters —worn on the back of the upper arm for up to 14 days, which measures glucose every 
minute in interstitial fluid through a small (5mm long, 0.4mm wide) filament that is inserted just under the skin 
and held in place wit h a small adhesive pad.[ADDRESS_443059] 2 times a day. CGMS data will be 
downloaded at each data collection visit. The stored amperometric data from the monitor will be transferred 
and converted to glucose concentrations after data collection is completed using an infrared link to a personal 
computer and are analyzed using the CGM S solution software  which will be maintained by [CONTACT_16133]. 
The FreeStyle Libre system generates an Ambulatory Glucose Profile (AGP) that provides a visual snapshot of 
glucose levels, trends and patterns over  time.  The following five glucose composites will be calculated: (1) the 
overall mean, (2) the proportion of readings indicating hypoglycemia (%<70mg/dL), (3) the propo rtion of 
readin gs indicating hyperglycemia (% >160mg/dL),  (4) the proportion of out of range readings (% either 
<70mg/dL or >160mg/dL) and (5) the SD of CGM glucose readings.63 Compared with SMBG, 85.5% of 
FreeStyle  Libre readings were clinically accurate and 99.0% were clinically acceptable on a Clarke error grid, 
using linear mixed modellin g.  
Statistical significance . The data will be evaluated for violations of statistical tests. If assumptions are 
violated, alternative tests will be used or the data will be transformed. Individual t -tests will be run on the 
baseline  variables (e.g. A1C, cognitive function tests ) to determine if  significant differences  exist between the 
intervention and control groups, and we will control for those baseline differences  in subsequent analyses. 
Analysis will follow intent -to-treat principles. Correlations will examine the relationships between the major 
variables. The significance level will be .[ADDRESS_443060].   
Statistical A nalyses.  For Aim 1 , we will use multilevel longitudinal models to estimate MAPSS -DM treatment 
effects on A1C, DM-SM and measurements of memory and executive function over time. Multilevel longitudinal 
models are generalizations of repeated -measures ANOVA that include every participant in the analysis, 
regardless of missing data, and will account for the clustering of me asurements within participants. The model 
will also contain fixed effects for intervention ( MAPSS -DM vs control ) interacted wit h me asurement occasion 
(baseline,  8 weeks, 3 months ), as well as for cohort and baseline covariates. We will use the models to test for 
overall treatment effects (p<0.05), effects at each post -baseline time -point, and within -subject effects. Effect 
sizes will be expressed as Cohen’s d. Additionally, We will use causal -mediation methods and exploit the 
longitudinal structure of the data collection to estimate the mediational role of cognitive function. We will 
regress each cognitive function measurement at 8 weeks (post -intervention) on the group  assignment  
(MAPSS -DM or control), the same cognitive measurement at baseline, and demographic controls.v&V2014 These 
regressions estimate the effect of the intervention on cognitive function at week 8. N ext, we will regress the [ADDRESS_443061] -intervention will be determined. The percentage of time spent in low 
(<70mg/dL), normal (7 1mg/dL – 120mg/dL) and high (>160 mg/dL) will be calculated. We will use analogous 
regression models to those in Aim [ADDRESS_443062] -
baseline time -points, and mediational role of the of glucose variability in the intervention's ef fect on cognitive 
functions. 
Potential sources of biological variation. To address the issue of potential differences in cognitive function, 
A1C, glucose variability, and DM -SM adherence between men and women, we will re -fit appropriate regression 
models from the analyses and include interaction terms between intervention group and sex.

You are invited  to be part of a research  study.  This consent  form will help you choose  whether 
or not to participate in the study. Feel free to ask if anything is not clear in this consent form.  
 
Important   Information   about   this  Research   Study  
Things  you should  know:  
• The purpose  of the study  is to test an intervention  to improve  cognitive  skills  and 
examine glucose changes for people with type 2 diabetes.  
• In order  to participate,  you must  be [ADDRESS_443064] 
access to the Internet on a computer, tablet or smartphone.  
• If you choose  to participate,  you will be asked  to (1) answer  questions  about  memory, 
ways of thinking, and diabetes self -management; (2) participate in online computer 
training for 20 minutes, 7 days a week and 4 online classes to help you improve your 
memory and learn more about  diabetes self -management; and (3) wear a continuous 
glucose monitor. This will take 22 weeks.  
• Risks or discomforts from this research include changing diabetes self -management 
(SM)  habits,  which  may lead to temporary  alterations  on blood  glucose  although  the goal 
of the intervention is to improve SM and ultimately improve blood glucose levels. 
Changing SM habits may result in fluctuating blood glucose levels leading to low blood 
sugar without a change in medication. You will be given information on monitoring for 
and managing low blood sugar prior to the start of the intervention. You will also be 
instructed to call your health care provider if you have any low blood sugar. There are 
minimal risks with wearing CGM sensors. Applying the sensor may cause bruising or 
bleeding and some patients may experience mild pain as the devise is fitted.  
• The possible  benefits  of this study  include  that you may increase  your knowledge.  
• Taking  part in this research  study  is voluntary.  You do not have  to participate,  and you 
can stop at any time.  
More  detailed  information  may be described  later in this form.  
Please  take time to read this entire  form and ask questions  before  deciding  whether  to take part 
in this research study.  
 
What   is  the  study   about   and  why  are  we  doing   it? 
In the [LOCATION_002], 90 -95% of the [ADDRESS_443065] type 2 diabetes 
(T2DM). Although the association between T2DM and cognitive dysfunction is not fully 
understood, we know T2DM increases the risk for cognitive problems and the rate of cognitive 
decline in those with T2DM is double that for those without it.  Blood sugar levels that go up and 
down  frequently  may also lead to cognitive  problems.  For these  reasons,  we are conducting  this 
study to test an educational program to learn if it can improve cognitive function and diabetes 
control.  
What   will  happen   if  you  take  part  in  this  study?

you will be in the group that participates in an online class to learn about skills to improve 
cognitive function and diabetes management or be in the group that uses online games only.  
The computer program is similar to flippi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a coin to decide what study group you will be in. 
Participants in Group 1  will: (1) attend four, small group, 2 -hour online classes that meet every 
other week for 8 weeks; (2) practice with cognitive skills with online computer games for 20 
minutes, 7 days a week;  and (3) wear a continuous glucose monitors  (CGM) for one week,  four 
times  during  the study  -before  the intervention,  immediately  after the intervention,  3 weeks  after 
the intervention, and 3 months after the intervention. Participants in Group 2  will: (1) practice 
cognitive skills with online computer games (frequency and duration are up to you); and (2) 
wear the CGM for one week after Study Visit 1 and after 5, 11, and 22 weeks of practice with 
the computer games.  
 
Study Visit 1: You will be sent a link to complete all the questionnaires and tests online. It 
should take you about [ADDRESS_443067]  will wear  the CGM  for one week,  four times  during  the study.  
Group  1: Participants in Group 1 will participate in four asynchronous, 2 -hr online classes held 
over 8 weeks  and taught  by a Registered  Nurse.  Classes  1 & 2 will focus  on common  cognitive 
problems in T2DM and strategies to improve cognitive skills. Classes 3 & 4 focus on lifestyle 
changes to support cognitive functioning and DM -SM skills. Each online class will follow the 
same format: (1) introduction/revisiting content from the previous class; (2) review of progress 
on computer exercises; (3) practicing cognitive strategies in class; and (4) a weekly topic.  
Participants  in Group  1 will also practice  with online  computer  games  (BrainHQ)  for 20 minutes, 
seven days a week. You will only need a computer, smart phone, or tablet with Internet access 
to log onto the secure website.  
Group 2: The study team will contact [CONTACT_355596] 5, 11, and [ADDRESS_443068]  experienced.  
Final  Study  visit: At week  22, both Group  1 and Group  2 will answer  the same  questions  asked 
at the initial study visit about how you manage your diabetes, how confident you are in diabetes 
self-management, your mood, and how you feel about your cognitive function. You will also be

asked  to take the same  five tests  you took at Study  Visit 1 to assess  your memory,  attention, 
speed of thinking, and motor speed.  
 
 How long will you be in this study  and how many  people  will be in the study?   
Sixty -six people  will participate  in this study.  The study  will last for 2 years,  but you will only be 
asked to participate for 22 weeks.  
 
 What  risks  and discomforts  might  you experience  from  being  in this study?   
There  are some  risks you might  experience  from being  in this study.  They  are minimal  as there 
are no known physical risks to educational and computer assisted interventions except for 
potential loss of privacy or confidentiality.  
Some participants may experience some stress by [CONTACT_355597]. The main risk lies in changing diabetes self -management (SM) habits, which may 
lead to temporary alterations on blood glucose although the goal of the intervention is to 
improve SM and ultimately improve blood glucose levels. Changing SM habits may result in 
fluctuating  blood  glucose  leading  to low blood  sugar  without  a change  in medication.  You will be 
given information on monitoring for and managing low blood sugar prior to the start of the 
intervention. You will also be instructed to call your health care provider if you have any low 
blood sugar.  
There are minimal risks with wearing CGM sensors. Applying the sensor may cause bruising or 
bleeding  and some  patients  may experience  mild pain as the device  is fitted.  However,  this pain 
is temporary and is similar to finger pricks for blood glucose monitoring. We will use the CGM 
equipment with other study participants. The sensors will not be shared. The transmitter 
wirelessly sends your blood sugar information from the sensor to the receiver. The transmitter, 
which snaps into the sensor, will be cleaned thoroughly with a diluted mixture of bleach or 
another appropriate cleaner after use. The FDA approved the CGM as a “single use device.” 
This means that they recommend that only one person use this device at a time as there is a 
rare risk that a bloodborne pathogen, such as Hepatitis B, may be spread if used with multiple 
patients.  
The researchers  will let you know  about  any significant  new findings  (such  as additional  risks or 
discomforts) that might make you change your mind about participating in this study.  
 
How  could   you  benefit   from   this  study?  
You might  benefit  from being  in this study  because  there  you may increase  your knowledge 
about strategies to manage cognitive symptoms and improve cognitive functioning through 
the computer assisted training.  
 
 What  will happen  to the samples  and/or  data we collect  from  you?   
As part of this study we will collect information from you about glucose control, diabetes self - 
management, and cognitive function. All of your answers and results will be kept on a secure,

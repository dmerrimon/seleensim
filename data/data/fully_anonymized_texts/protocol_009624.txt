Background, Rationale and Context 
Obesity exacerbates age-related declines in physical function a nd is a strong determinant of mobility 
disability.1-[ADDRESS_960667] of older adults are obese;[ADDRESS_960668] weight is comprised of lean 
mass,8-11 current weight loss recommendations regarding macronutrient co mposition ‒ and protein in particular 
‒ during caloric restriction may exacerbate the loss of lean ma ss in older adults, further compromising physical 
function over the long-term. Moreover, studies suggest that old er adults need more protein to elicit the same 
stimulatory effect on muscle protein synthesis and maintain lea n mass than younger adults.12-16 Thus, 
recommendations for effective weight loss treatments that prese rve lean mass and optimize function in obese 
older adults may differ from those for younger adults. Additionally, recent Guidelines (2013) for the 
Management of Overweight and Obesity in Adults  stated “there is a need for further research to understand the  
most appropriate strategies and prescriptions for weight loss [ in] older adults.”17  
Limited evidence in older adults shows that weight loss improve s physical function while in the weight-reduced 
state.8;18-[ADDRESS_960669] 
shown that weight regain after weight loss resulted in greater regain of fat relative to lean mass a year after the intervention.
26;27 Consequently, weight loss and subsequent regain may lead to ev en less relative lean mass 
and worse physical function. This problem highlights the need t o identify a strategy that preserves lean mass 
during weight loss and promotes the deposition of lean mass following weight loss. Similar to studies in younger adults,
28 we previously found that a higher protein diet during caloric restriction may be a key 
determinant for retaining lean mass during weight loss in postmenopausal women.10;29 A higher protein diet 
after weight loss may also enhance weight loss maintenance by r educing overall weight regain, in part, by 
[CONTACT_224389].30 Thus, the potential benefits of a higher protein diet during a nd 
subsequent to weight loss in obese older adults should translat e into even greater improvements in physical 
function over both the short- and long-term; however, this needs to be definitively tested.   
Objectives  
Our primary goal  is to determine the effect of a higher protein (1.2 g/kg body wt/d; ~30% of energy) / lower 
carbohydrate (CHO; 40-45% of energy) diet during a 6-month weig ht loss intervention in obese older adults on 
physical function compared with an isocaloric lower protein (cu rrent RDA of 0.8 g/kg body wt/d; 15-20% of 
energy) / higher CHO (55-60% of energy) diet, and whether conti nuing a higher protein / lower CHO diet 
following weight loss results in better maintenance of physical  function. This will be accomplished with an 18-
month randomized trial in 225 obese (BMI 30-45 kg/m2 or 27-30 kg/m2 with 1 additional risk factor), older (65-
85 years) men and women at risk for disability (expSPPB <2.50).  All participants will undergo a 6-month weight 
loss intervention of caloric restriction and exercise followed by 12 months of follow-up with randomization to 
one of three groups (n=75/group): 1) Lower protein / higher CHO  diet for the 6-month weight loss and 12-
month follow-up phases (RecProt); 2) Higher protein / lower CHO  diet for the 6-month weight loss phase only 
(6-mo HiProt); or 3) Higher protein / lower CHO diet for the 6- month weight loss and 12-month follow-up 
phases (18-mo HiProt).  
Primary Aim: To determine the effects of a higher protein / lower CHO diet vs. lower protein / higher CHO diet 
during a 6-month weight loss intervention and 12 months of foll ow-up on 18-month physical function assessed 
by [CONTACT_707117] (primary out come) and muscle strength. 
V08.02.22     3 Hypothesis: Participants randomized to a higher protein diet du ring weight loss and follow-up (18-mo 
HiProt) will have greater improvements in physical function tha n participants randomized to a higher protein 
diet during weight loss only (6-mo HiProt), followed by [CONTACT_57669] r andomized to a lower protein diet (RecProt). 
Secondary Aim: To determine the effects of a higher protein / l ower CHO diet vs. lower protein / higher CHO 
diet during a 6-month weight loss intervention and 12 months of  follow-up on 18-month body weight and body 
composition. 
Hypothesis: Participants randomized to a higher protein diet du ring weight loss and follow-up (18-mo 
HiProt) will have better weight loss maintenance, lower fat-to- lean mass ratio, greater thigh muscle volume, 
and lower inter-muscular adipose tissue than participants rando mized to a higher protein diet during weight 
loss only (6-mo HiProt), followed by [CONTACT_224391] a lowe r protein diet (RecProt). 
We will also assess the effects of a higher protein diet on: 1)  6-month changes in physical function, weight, and 
body composition; 2) 6- and 18-month changes in bone mineral de nsity; and 3) 6- and 18-month changes in 
cardiometabolic risk factors (e.g., glucose and lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805]); and 4)  whether the effects of a higher protein diet on 
lean mass mediates the effects on physical function at 6- and 1 8-months.  
Methods and Measures 
Study Overview: 
We will use a 3-group design in 225 obese (BMI 27-30kg/m2 with 1 risk factor or BMI 30-45 kg/m2), older (65-
79 years) men and women at risk for disability (expSPPB <2.50) who will undergo a 6-month weight loss 
intervention followed by a 12-month follow-up phase to test our  overall hypothesis that a higher protein (1.2 
g/kg body wt/d) / lower CHO diet during a 6-month weight loss i ntervention improves physical function 
compared with an isocaloric lower protein (the current RDA, 0.8  g/kg body wt/d) / higher CHO diet and 
continuing a higher protein / lower CHO diet for 12-months foll owing weight loss will result in better 
maintenance of improved physical function. All participants wil l undergo a 6-month weight loss intervention 
involving caloric restriction and supervised exercise followed by 12 months of follow-up with randomization to 
one of three groups (n=75/group):  1) Lower protein / higher CH O diet for the 6-month weight loss and 12-
month follow-up phases (RecProt); 2) Higher protein / lower CHO  diet for the 6-month weight loss phase only 
(6-mo HiProt); or 3) Higher protein / lower CHO diet for the 6- month weight loss and 12-month follow-up 
phases (18-mo HiProt). Physical function (primary aim) will be assessed by [CONTACT_224392] (expSPPB) and muscle strength and body comp osition (secondary aim) assessed by 
[CONTACT_751]-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and computed tomography (CT) at baseline, 6- and 18-months. At the 
same time points, we will also measure bone mineral density (DX A) and cardiometabolic risk factors.   
Recruitment of study participants: 
We plan to recruit, screen, and enroll 225 participants in Year s 1-3 (~1-2 per week). Our recruitment goals 
include: 30% male and 25% minority. We will target men and wome n ≥65 years who live in the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_224373], 
including the Greensboro metropolitan area (a 20-[ADDRESS_960670] f rom the Medical Center). We will use 
community-based recruitment strat egies developed by [CONTACT_53618] l Research Core of the WFU Pepper Center, 
including direct mail, newspaper advertisements, and cross-stud y referrals from other on-going studies. 
Specific inclusion/exclusion criteria (see Table 1) are in plac e to eliminate those that may be adversely 
affected by [CONTACT_224393] . To reduce the 
potential adverse effects of WL, we will exclude individuals th at are non-obese, those with recent WL, those 
who have osteoporosis, and/or anyone on medications that may af fect bone density. We also exclude anyone 
who cannot walk unassisted. 
Participant screening and randomization: 
All individuals who respond to our recruitment strategies will call a toll-free phone number and a recruiter will 
describe the study and perform a brief screen for general eligi bility (see Table 1 ). They will be asked about 
their age, weight, height, current physical activity habits, bo dy weight in the past year, smoking history, medical 
history, and current medications. All participants must conform  to the inclusion/exclusion criteria.  
Individuals who pass the telephone screening will be scheduled for an in-clinic screening visit (SV1) which is 
conducted in the early morning following an overnight (8 hr) fa st. Before any data collection, all participants will 
provide written informed consent and complete a HIPAA authoriza tion form in accordance with the WFSM IRB 
policies. At this visit, weight and height will be measured to calculate BMI. After confirmation of meeting the 
V08.02.22     4 BMI inclusion criteria, individuals will undergo further screen ing including the expanded Short Physical 
Performance Battery (expSPPB), a cognitive screen (Montreal Cog nitive Assessment, MoCA31), physical 
activity assessment (the Community Healthy Activities Model Pro gram for Seniors [CHAMPS] questionnaire32) 
to ensure no regular participation in resistance exercise or hi gh-volume aerobic training in the past [ADDRESS_960671] (Center for Epi[INVESTIGATOR_904] S tudies-Depression, CES-D33), a weight loss 
readiness questionnaire, and, if still eligible, a medical hist ory, a comprehensive review of medications, blood 
pressure, and a fasting blood draw for a metabolic screening pa nel and complete blood count (CBC) to 
exclude those with recent history of coronary heart disease, ca ncer, liver or renal disease, severe pulmonary 
disease, gross physical impairment, uncontrolled hypertension, uncontrolled diabetes, or any contraindications 
to exercise. Participants will also be given a 4-day food recor d to complete. If still eligible, a second in-clinic 
screening visit will be scheduled for a GXT (to rule out any co ntraindications for supervised exercise) and DXA 
scan (to rule out osteoporosis) and to collect the 4-day food r ecord. Participants will also do a taste test of the 
protein and carbohydrate supplements to ensure that they are wi lling to consume the product during the 
intervention and complete a perceived weight loss readiness que stionnaire.

Study Interventions 
6-month weight loss intervention: 
Caloric restriction and behavior modification/nutrition education :  All participants will undergo a dietary weight 
loss intervention designed to elicit behavioral changes leading  to decreased caloric intake sufficient to yield a 
~10% loss of initial body mass . Recommended weight loss interve ntions for obese older adults include 
moderate caloric restriction (CR) to elicit a weight loss of 0. 5-1 kg/wk.1;34-36 Thus, the 6-month weight loss 
V08.02.22     6 intervention is designed to elicit ~0.5 kg/wk weight loss throu gh a CR level of -500 kcal/d, plus an exercise 
prescription that meets current American Heart Association (AHA ) and American College of Sports Medicine 
(ACSM) physical activity recommendations for older adults (desc ribed below).37 With a calorie deficit of 500 
kcal/d, we expect total weight loss of ~10.[ADDRESS_960675] measurement of resting metabolic rate and apply ing an activity factor based on a description of 
their daily activities (typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] 1.3 for sedentary persons). N o woman will be recommended <1100 kcals/d and 
no man <1300 kcals/d.  
The weight loss intervention will incorporate nutrition educati on (via group and individual meetings with the 
study dietitian), self-monitoring skills, cognitive-behavioral strategies for promoting lifestyle behavior 
modifications, and planned meals. Behavioral and educational gr oup and individual sessions will be held 
weekly in a 3:1 ratio (3 group and 1 individual session per mon th). Group sessions will be held in-person in 
small groups (maximum of 6 participants per group) to maintain physical distancing (with the option to go 
entirely remotely via WebEx or phone if the conditions arise – e.g., increase in COVID-[ADDRESS_960676], and/or  if stay at home orders are put back in place). 
Individual sessions will be held in-person with the option of r emote sessions (via WebEx or phone) if the 
conditions arise. The diet intervention will be based on partic ipants choosing and preparing their own meals 
from the meal plans. Sessions will be led by [CONTACT_224394] n and/or interventionist with expertise in 
behavior therapy with older adults. All participants will be in structed in behavior modification with advice on 
food selection, portion size, relapse prevention, and self-moni toring techniques. Emphasis will be placed on 
following the menus provided. The behavioral sessions will focu s on awareness of changing eating habits to 
lower caloric intake. Factual information regarding what food c hanges to make, how to make them, and why 
they are important will be explained. Each group session will i nclude problem solving. During the individual 
sessions, the study dietitian will review individual progress, solve problems, answer questions, and set goals. 
Examples of topi[INVESTIGATOR_224376], emoti onal eating, eating out, self-monitoring, 
reacting to environmental and social cues, portion control, and  relapse prevention. All participants will be 
taught self-monitoring techniques for diet and body weight. The y will be asked to track their daily intake of all 
foods and beverages in a log book provided to them, and given f eedback on their log books at each session.   
Meal plans will be developed based on estimated calorie levels in 100 calorie increments (1100 calories, 
1200 calories, 1300 calories, etc) to attain the weight loss go al. Each meal plan will have up to 7 
interchangeable choices at each meal (breakfast, lunch, dinner)  and snack (midday and evening). At each 
meal, participants within a given calorie level will select foo ds from the list to prepare and consume. There will 
also be choices that allow for eating meals at restaurants that  meet the specified guidelines. Meals will differ 
between calorie levels in portion size and types of foods. In a ddition, there will be different selections for 
those on the higher protein / lower CHO diet vs. the lower prot ein / higher CHO diet (see below). The food 
plan will allow for individual preferences for various food ite ms, and the study dietitian will work with 
participants to tailor the diet to individual needs. Participan ts will be advised to take calcium (500-1000 mg/d) 
and vitamin D (800 IU/d) supplements to ensure adequate intake of these nutrients.   
Body weight will be monitored and recorded weekly. Participant logs of everything they eat or drink will be 
reviewed weekly by [CONTACT_224395]. If a participant is not meeting weight 
loss goals (~0.5 kg/wk), calorie intakes will be individually m odified to produce the desired rate of weight loss.  
If it is evident, either through diet logs or inadequate weight  loss (~0.5 kg/wk), that participants are not 
compliant, individual counseling sessions with the study dietit ian will be held to improve compliance. For 
participants who have difficulty in achieving the weight-loss a nd/or protein intake goals, we will use a 
behavioral “toolbox” that includes frequent individual behavior al counseling sessions, prescription of meal 
replacements, incentives, home-assessments, or other items deem ed appropriate. Diet plans may be altered 
to restrict snacks and/or the size of meals to meet weight loss  goals.   
Macronutrient distribution :  Those in the higher protein / lower CHO diet groups (6-mo Hi Prot and 18-mo 
HiProt) will be prescribed a diet containing more protein than those in the lower protein (the current RDA) / 
higher CHO diet group (RecProt). To ensure the diets are isocal oric, this protein will replace part of the 
carbohydrate prescribed in the lower protein / higher CHO diet group. Individuals assigned to the lower protein 
/ higher CHO diet will have a targeted protein intake of 0.8 g/ kg body wt/d (~15-20% of energy), 25-30% of 
energy from fat (<10% from saturated fat), and 55-60% of energy  from carbohydrates. The higher protein / 
lower CHO diet groups will have a targeted protein intake of 1. 2 g/kg body wt/d (~30% of energy) with a 
V08.02.22     7 reduction in CHO to 40-45% of energy. Both the higher and lower protein diet groups fall within the Dietary 
Reference Intakes for macronutrients including protein (10-35% of energy).38 Fat intake will remain similar 
between groups while CHO will fluctuate to compensate for diffe rences in energy from protein between groups.  
Participants in the higher protein / lower CHO diet groups will  consume a protein supplement daily (NutraBio™ 
100% Whey Protein Isolate) which will be provided throughout th e study. The supplement will provide ~[ADDRESS_960677] a protein threshold of 25-30 g protein 
containing ~2.5-2.8 g of leucine/meal optimizes protein synthes is,40-42 participants will be instructed to consume 
25 g (1 scoop) of the protein supplement twice daily with their  morning and midday meal/afternoon snack. 
Participants in the lower protein / higher CHO diet group will consume a carbohydrate supplement daily 
(NutraBio CarboMax; provided throughout the study) which will p rovide ~[ADDRESS_960678]-weight 
loss follow-up visit. 
Exercise Intervention :  All participants will be expected to participate in a superv ised, center-based exercise 
program involving moderate-intensity aerobic exercise (e.g., tr eadmill walking) 3 days/wk during the first 6 
weeks of the 6-month weight loss intervention in accordance wit h the AHA and ACSM physical activity 
recommendations for older adults.37 All participant supervised, center-based exercise sessions wil l be 
scheduled in advance to ensure that physical distancing can be maintained (maximum of 5 participants per 
session). Supervised exercise sessions will occur in our resear ch exercise facility under the direction of an 
exercise interventionist to minimize individual variability in compliance and progression. Injuries will be 
minimized by a feasible progression of exercise duration and ca reful monitoring of proper footwear and 
stretching exercises. Each exercise session will begin and end with 3-5 min of walking at slow pace and light 
stretching. The aerobic training program will progress from 15- 20 min at 50% heart rate reserve (HRR; based 
on age-predicted maximal heart rate) the 1st week to 40 min at 65-70% HRR by [CONTACT_2671] 6th week. Heart 
rate (HR) will be measured before each exercise session and at least two HR readings (measured by [CONTACT_224396]) will be taken during aerobic exercise. Tre admill speed and grade will be adjusted as 
necessary to ensure that participants exercise at their prescri bed exercise intensity. Treadmill speed and 
grade, heart rate, exercise duration, and amount of energy expe nded will be recorded for each exercise 
session. After the first 6 weeks of the 6-month weight loss int ervention, participants will continue center-based 
exercise 1-2 days/wk and exercise on their own 1-2 days/wk for a total of 3 days/wk combined center- and 
home-based exercise (with the option of transitioning to all ho me-based exercise if the conditions arise – e.g., 
increase in COVID-[ADDRESS_960679], and/or if 
stay at home orders are put back in place). Participants will b e taught how to rate their perceived exertion so 
that their home-based exercise mirrors that done during their s upervised, center-based exercise sessions 
(target RPE between 13 and 15) and given tips on how to exercis e safely on their own. Participants will be 
asked to keep exercise logs detailing the date, type, duration and their rating of perceived exertion for each 
home-based exercise session. Compliance to the exercise prescri ption (attendance/ frequency, intensity and 
duration) will be monitored. The goal for attendance at center-  and home-based exercise sessions is >80% 
and participants who miss >3 sessions per month will be counsel ed to improve exercise attendance.    
12-month follow-up:   At the end of the 6-month weight loss intervention, the study d ietitian will meet individually 
with all participants to devise a weight maintenance strategy, including sample meal plans. Participants will be 
encouraged to use relapse-prevention techniques, e.g., managing  the environment, adjusting appropriate goal-
based daily energy needs, and continuing self-regulatory skills . At the 6-month post-weight loss intervention 
follow-up visit, participants will again meet individually with  the study dietitian, review their weight maintenance 
goals and strategies, and make modifications as needed. Partici pants randomized to a higher protein / lower 
CHO diet during the 12-month follow-up period (18-mo HiProt) wi ll be provided with a protein supplement (see 
above) to consume daily and counseled on how to include the pro tein supplement in their maintenance meal 
plan. Participants who have difficulty consuming the protein su pplement will be given the option to reduce the 
V08.02.22     8 frequency of the protein supplement by [CONTACT_224397]. Group seminars on 
health-related topi[INVESTIGATOR_224377]. 
Schedule and organization of assessment visits 
All assessments will be conducted during 7 visits (two screenin g, two baseline, one 6-month post-weight loss 
intervention, one 12-month follow-up, and one 18-month follow-u p visits; Table 2 ). The nature, purpose, and 
risks of all tests will be explained to participants prior to o btaining their written consent and prior to each test.

FV1/2, and FV4/5), participants will be given a light breakfast . BV1 and BV2 will occur approximately one week 
apart. The follow-up visits will occur (1) after the 6-month in tervention (FV1/2; weeks 27-32), (2) [ADDRESS_960683]-
intervention (FV3; weeks 53-56), and (3) [ADDRESS_960684]-interve ntion (FV4/5; weeks 79-84).  
The first screening visit (SV1)  will be conducted in the morning following an [ADDRESS_960685], the expanded Short Phys ical Performance Battery (expSPPB)43 will be 
administered and scored. If still eligible, participants will t hen undergo a cognitive screen (assessed using the 
Montreal Cognitive Assessment, MoCA16), a depression screen (assessed using the Center for 
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_2557]-Depression (CES-D)), a weight loss read iness questionnaire, and a medical history 
and review of medications and dietary supplements. The CHAMPS P hysical Activity Questionnaire for Older 
Adults32 will be administered to estimate physical activity in a typi[INVESTIGATOR_19529] l week over the past [ADDRESS_960686] 
screening visit, the study coordinator will check the lab resul ts to determine if the participant is still eligible 
based on blood work. If the participant is eligible, they will be notified and scheduled for a second screening 
visit. If the participant is not eligible, they will be notifie d and given a copy of their screening blood work.  
At the second screening visit (SV2) , participants will undergo an assessment of Perceived Fatigue on the 
treadmill as a warm-up to acclimate participants to the treadmi ll. Then participants will do a graded exercise 
stress test (VO 2 max) using a Ramp protocol44 to exclude those with exercise-induced ischemia. All 
participants must be free of any contraindications for particip ation in an exercise program according to the 
American College of Sports Medicine criteria.[ADDRESS_960687] of the protein and carb ohydrate supplements to ensure they are willing to 
consume them for the duration of the study. Participants who ar e eligible to participate in the study will be 
randomized to one of the 3 study intervention groups (following  all baseline testing) using a web-based 
randomization scheme (from [CONTACT_224428]) with blocking stratified b y gender.  
At the first baseline visit 1 (BV1) , weight, lower extremity muscle strength (Biodex dynamometer),  grip 
strength, and 400-m walk time will be measured. Any changes to medical history and current medications and 
dietary supplements will be reviewed. Then the Mobility Assessm ent Tool for Disability – short form (MAT-sf) to 
assess difficulty performing daily tasks, the Short Form 36 (SF -36) to assess quality of life, the Digit Symbol 
Substitution Test (DSST) to assess attention and psychomotor sp eed, and the FACIT questionnaire to assess 
fatigue will be administered. The participant will also have a series of CT scans (abdomen, hip and thigh) at 
this visit. Participants will be given a 24-hr urine collection  bottle and instructions for collecting urine. 
Participants will be scheduled for their BV2 visit approximatel y one week later.  
Baseline visit 2 (BV2)  will take place approximately 1 week after the BV1 visit in th e morning (after an [ADDRESS_960688]). Participants will have their weight and blood pressure measured. Then participants will have 
their resting metabolic rate (RMR) assessed for the purpose of estimating each person’s baseline calorie level. 
Participants will also undergo tests to assess arterial stiffne ss, including aortic augmentation index (AIx) and 
arterial wave reflection magnitude. Participants will then have  blood drawn for glucose, insulin, HbA1c, lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], 
and storage. The first of three 24-hr dietary recalls will be a dministered to introduce and train the participant for 
the procedures used in subsequent 24-hr dietary recalls done by  [CONTACT_648] (in the event that scheduling precludes 
V08.02.[ADDRESS_960689] 24-hr dietary recall administered by [CONTACT_648]). Two addition al 24-hr diet recalls will be administered by [CONTACT_224399]2 but prior to the participant’s first intervention visit.  (24-hr diet recalls may be started at BV1 for some participants to ensure they are completed prior to the start of intervention.)  Following all fasting measures, participants will be given a snack. Medical history and current medications and dietary supplements will be reviewed. The 24-hour urine sample will be collected to measure urinary nitrogen and creatinine for estimating dietary protein intake and for storage.  
Randomization/first intervention visit.  Due to the group nature of the diet classes, participants will be 
randomized in waves with all participants starting intervention in a given week. The study interventionist will 
check to see which intervention group the participant is random ized to at their first meeting with each eligible 
participant during the first week of each wave’s intervention.  
The 6-month follow-up visit (FV1/2)  will take place following week [ADDRESS_960690] their resting metabolic rate (RMR) measured for the p urpose of estimating each person’s weight 
maintenance calorie level. The participant will also undergo tests to assess arterial stiffness. Blood will be 
drawn for glucose, insulin, HbA1c, lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], CMP and CBC, and sto rage. Participants will then be provided with a 
snack. Any changes to medical history and current medications and dietary supplements will be reviewed. Whole-body, AP spi[INVESTIGATOR_050], and hip DXA scans will be done. The participant will have anthropometric 
measurements taken at their waist, hip and thigh. Lower extremity muscle strength (Biodex dynamometer), grip 
strength, physical performance (expSPPB), and 400-m walk time w ill be measured. The MAT-sf and DSST will 
be administered. The CHAMPS Physical Activity Questionnaire, CES-D, SF-36, and FACIT questionnaires will be administered at the visit time permitting or by [CONTACT_224400]-person visit. A series of 
CT scans (abdomen, hip and thigh) will be done. Participants will be given the 24-hr urine collection bottle and instructions for collecting urine to measure urinary nitrogen and creatinine for estimating dietary protein intake 
and for storage. Three 24-hr diet recalls will be administered by [CONTACT_224401]1/2 visit window. . 
Participants will schedule to drop off their 24-hour urine sample following their FV1/2 visit 
Monthly phone calls : Participants will be called once a month during the 12-mo follow-up to ensure those that 
are in the 18-mo HiProt are continuing to consume the protein supplement. All participants will be asked about 
any health changes, injuries, etc., that may have occurred and any events recorded using the Adverse Event 
Form.  
The 12-month follow-up visit (FV3)  will take place following week [ADDRESS_960691] 
their weight and blood pressure measured. Lower extremity muscl e strength, grip strength, physical 
performance (expSPPB), and 400-m walk time will be measured. Th e CHAMPS Physical Activity 
Questionnaire, MAT-sf, CES-D, SF-36, and FACIT questionnaires w ill be administered. Medical history and 
current medications and dietary supplements will be reviewed.  The 18-month follow-up visit (FV4/5)  will take place following week 78 in the morning (after an [ADDRESS_960692]). Participants will have their weight and blood pressure measured. Blood will be drawn for 
glucose, insulin, HbA1c, lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], CMP and CBC, and storage. Part icipants will then be provided with a snack. 
Any changes to medical history and current medications and diet ary supplements will be reviewed. Whole-
body, AP spi[INVESTIGATOR_050], and hip DXA scans will be done. The participant  will have anthropometric measurements 
taken at their waist, hip and thigh. Lower extremity muscle str ength (Biodex dynamometer), grip strength, 
physical performance (expSPPB), and 400-m walk time will be mea sured. The MAT-sf and DSST will be 
administered. The CHAMPS Physical Activity Questionnaire, CES-D , SF-36, and FACIT questionnaires will be 
administered at the visit time permitting or by [CONTACT_224400]-person visit. A series of CT scans (abdomen, hip and thigh) will be done. Participants will be given their 24-hr urine collection bottle and 
instructions for collecting urine to measure urinary nitrogen and creatinine for estimating dietary protein intake 
and for storage ahead of their FV4/5 visit and asked to return it at their FV4/5 visit. Three 24-hr diet recalls will 
be administered by [CONTACT_224403]4/[ADDRESS_960693] after rand omization (e.g., eGFR), the participant will be 
asked to return to the clinic and provide an additional blood s ample and/or have the test repeated. 
V08.02.[ADDRESS_960694] of all assessments before 
data collection. Participants will be instructed to wear approp riate and comfortable clothing, and standardized 
written instructions will be pr ovided prior to each study visit .   
Primary outcomes  (assessed at baseline and at 6-, 12- and 18-month follow-up):  
Physical performance will be assessed using a modified version of the Short Physical Performance Battery  
(SPPB), a widely used assessment of lower extremity physical fu nction which includes progressively more 
challenging standing balance tasks held for 10 seconds each (si de-by-side, tandem and semi-tandem), the 
faster of two 4-m walks to assess usual gait speed, and time to  complete 5 repeated chair stands.45  Each of 
the three performance measures is assigned a score ranging from 0 (inability to do the test) to 4 (the highest 
level of performance) and summed to create an SPPB summary scor e ranging from 0 (worst) to 12 (best). We 
will also administer the components of the expanded Short Physical Performance Battery  (expSPPB) which 
was modified from the original SPPB to increase the holding tim e of the semi- and full-tandem stands to [ADDRESS_960695] of ba lance (walking at usual pace within lines of 
tape spaced 20 cm apart). The scoring system was developed to a void ceiling effects observed with the SPPB 
battery.43 ExpSPPB scores are continuous and range from 0 to 4, with high er scores indicative of better 
performance.  
Maximal isokinetic knee extension and flexion strength  will be measured using an i sokinetic dynamometer 
(Biodex) at two speeds (60°/sec and 120°/sec) with the particip ant sitting and the hips and knee flexed at 90°.  
The dynamometer will be adjusted for each participant and all a djustments will be recorded to duplicate the 
position for subsequent assessments. Start and stop angles will  be set at 90° and 30°. Strength is expressed in 
Newton-meters (Nm). Two trials will be done consisting of [ADDRESS_960696] 6 months, eye s urgery (e.g., cataract surgery) within the past 
month, blood pressure >199/[ADDRESS_960697] the dominant leg (i.e., knee replacement) in which case th e non-dominant leg will be used; the maximum 
knee extensor strength from the same leg will be used at 6- and  18-month follow-up. 
Grip strength  will be measured twice in each hand using an isometric hydraul ic hand dynamometer (Jamar, 
Bolingbrook, IL) and the mean value from the stronger hand used . Participants will be excluded from 
performing the test if they report hand-pain or recent hand or wrist surgery.   
The 400-meter walk  is a walking-based test of exercise tolerance and aerobic fitn ess.43 Participants are 
instructed to complete the 400 m distance (on a flat indoor sur face) as quickly as possible at a maintainable 
pace and the time to complete the walk is recorded in seconds. Encouragement is given in a standardized 
fashion every lap. The test will be terminated if the participa nt is unable to continue because of pain, fatigue, or 
other symptom. The test has excellent reproducibility (ICC=0.95 ),47 directly correlates with measured maximal 
aerobic fitness.48  
Secondary outcomes  (assessed at baseline and at 6- and 18-month follow-up):   
Body composition . Fat and whole body and appendicular lean mass will be measure d by [CONTACT_751]-energy X-ray 
absorptiometry (DXA; Horizon A, Hologic Inc.). Whole body scans  will be acquired with the participant supi[INVESTIGATOR_224378]. All scans will be performed  and analyzed by [CONTACT_224404] y and has vast experience in body composition 
assessments in older adults. Daily quality control scans are ob tained with Hologic’s phantom. Anthropometric 
measures of fat distribution will be assessed by [CONTACT_224405], hip, and thigh using 
a tape measure. 
Thigh muscle volume and body fat distribution . Thigh muscle volume and inter-muscular adipose tissue 
(IMAT) and subcutaneous and visceral abdominal fat (SAT and VAT , respectively) will be measured by 
[CONTACT_20420] (CT; Siemens S OMATOM Definition Flash 64-sl ice CT scanner,Siemens Medical 
Solutions [LOCATION_003], Inc., Malvern, PA). Participants will be positio ned supi[INVESTIGATOR_224379]. A 5-cm section of the thigh centered at t he junction of the proximal and middle third of the 
femur will be used to quantify thigh muscle and adipose tissue.  Thigh muscle attenuation (Hounsfield units), 
V08.02.[ADDRESS_960698] attenuation values will be obtained with t he GE Healthcare, Advantage Windows 4.2 
Volume Viewer (Waukesha, WI).  This software provides the abili ty to determine tissue-specific thresholds 
based on CT number (-190 to -30 Hounsfield units for fat) and v olumetrically measure complex structures 
using semi-automated techniques such as edge attraction and vol ume rendering. The same CT reading 
technician will analyze all scans.  Daily calibration scans are  obtained according to the manufacturer’s 
recommended procedure.  
Tertiary outcomes  (assessed at baseline and at 6- and 18-month follow-up [Arterial Stiffness at baseline and 6-
month follow-up only]):  
Bone mineral density . DXA will be used to analyze bone mineral density (BMD) using specific scans of the 
anterior-posterior (AP) spi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (L1-L4) and proximal femur.  
Volumetric bone mineral density, morphometry and strength . Helical CT scans of the lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_224380]/pelvis will be used to measure volumetric bone mineral dens ity, structure and strength of the lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_050] 
(L1-L5), total hip and proximal femur. The scan coverage for th e lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_224381] L1 
through the base of L5. The hip/pelvis scan will cover the regi on from the superior acetabulum to mid-femur. 
The mid-femur position will be defined as the midpoint between the superior aspect of the greater trochanter 
and the inferior aspect of the lateral condyle. To locate the m id-point, an anterior-posterior scout of the entire 
femur will be obtained. The same Mindways bone mineral phantom (Mindways Software, Inc., Austin, TX) will 
be imaged in every scan.   
Lipoprotein lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805] . The lipoprotein lipid assays will be performed by [CONTACT_224406].  
Fasting glucose and insulin . Fasting glucose and insulin assays will be performed by [CONTACT_224407]. An estimate 
of insulin sensitivity by [CONTACT_224408] (HOM A) score will be calculated with the formula: 
fasting plasma insulin (μU/ml) × glucose (mmol/l)/22.5.51 Glucose and insulin area under the curve will be 
determined using Tai’s model: ½×30×(y 0min+2y 30min+2y 60min+2y 90min+y120min ), where y represents insulin or 
glucose values at the different time points.52  
Blood pressure  will be measured in the right arm, using an automated sphygmom anometer, with the 
participant in a seated position after having rested quietly fo r 10-15 minutes. Systolic and diastolic blood 
pressure will be defined as the average of three repeated measu res.  
Arterial Stiffness measures . The SphygmoCor XCEL system i s an automated device that will b e used to 
measure central pressure waveform and corresponding indices (i. e., central blood pressure, aortic 
augmentation index [AIx], and reflection magnitude) using press ure oscillations from an arm cuff and a 
validated, generalized transfer function.54-56 Aortic AIx is calculated as the ratio of augmentation pressure  (i.e., 
the supplementary increase in systolic blood pressure due to ea rly arterial wave reflections) to pulse pressure 
and is expressed as a percentage.[ADDRESS_960699] amplitudes.58 
Descriptive variables and potential covariates: 
Perceived fatigue and maximal aerobic capacity  (VO 2max). Perceived fatigue will be assessed at a given 
workload. Participants will walk on a treadmill for 5 min at 0%  grade at a fixed, comfortable speed of 2.[ADDRESS_960700]. Nicklas and [CONTACT_224429] (Master’s level 
Exercise Physiologist) have extensive experience measuring VO 2max in older persons. Throughout the 
treadmill test, ventilatory and gas exchange responses will be measured on a breath-by-breath basis using a 
computerized system (Medical Graphics), which provides valid an d reliable gas analysis.49;[ADDRESS_960701]-interventio n testing will be conducted using the same 
treadmill and gas analysis system. VO 2max will be expressed both as ml of oxygen uptake per kg of bod y 
V08.02.22     13 weight per minute (ml/kg bwt/min) and per kg of lean mass per m inute (ml/kg LM/min). Two of the following [ADDRESS_960702] to be considered valid (or the  test will be repeated): 1) plateau in oxygen 
consumption with increasing workload (< 200 ml/min); 2) respi[INVESTIGATOR_224382] ≥1.10; and 3) maximal HR 
within 90% of age-predicted maximal HR ( 208 – [0.7 x age] ).   
Resting metabolic rate (RMR)  will be measured at baseline for prescribing calorie deficits during the weight 
loss intervention and at [ADDRESS_960703] quietly for 
20-30 minutes before testing. Measurement of oxygen consumption  and carbon dioxide production are 
collected continuously for up to 30 minutes and RMR is calculat ed using the Weir equation.59  
Demographic characteristics  (age, sex, race, education, and socio-economic status) will be  ascertained by 
[CONTACT_224409].  
A weight loss readiness  questionnaire will assess participants’ motivation, commitment , and any barriers to 
attending the 6-month weight loss intervention at the screening  visit. 
Medical information regarding co-morbidities  will be ascertained at the screening visit. We will record 
medication and supplement use  at baseline and at 6-, 12- and 18-month follow-up. Participant s will be asked 
to bring in medications and dietary supplements for a "brown ba g" review. The medication form will specifically 
ask about the use of protein supplements, anti-inflammatory age nts, and sex steroids or corticosteroids. 
Cognitive function  will be assessed at screening using the Montreal Cognitive Ass essment (MoCA),[ADDRESS_960704] score ≥[ADDRESS_960705] (DSST) at basel ine and at 6- and 18-mo follow-up. 
Participants are given a series of numbered symbols and then as ked to draw the appropriate symbols below a 
list of random numbers. The score is the number of correctly ma de matches in 2 minutes (120 seconds).  
Initial body weight and change in body weight : Participants will be weighed, without shoes or heavy 
clothing, on a standard, calibrated scale weekly during the 6-m onth weight loss intervention and at the 
baseline, 6-, 12- and 18-month follow-up visits.   
Compliance : During the 6-month weight loss phase, participants will be as ked to track their daily intake of all 
foods and beverages in a log book provided to them and their lo g books reviewed at each session. 
Attendance at group and individual diet and exercise sessions a nd protein supplement usage during the 
study will also be tracked.  
Physical activity : Physical activity will be assessed by [CONTACT_6270]-report at baseline , and at 6-, 12- and 18-month 
follow-up using the CHAMPS physical activity questionnaire.32  
Dietary intake : Three 24-hr dietary recalls (two week days and one weekend da y) will be performed on all 
participants at baseline, and at 6- and 18-month follow-up. Exp erienced registered dietitians trained in 24-hr 
dietary recall interviews from the WFSM Clinical Research Unit (CRU) who are not involved with the diet 
intervention will conduct the 24-hour dietary recalls. Data wil l be collected and analyzed using the Nutrition 
Data System for Research  (NDSR) software developed and supported by [CONTACT_224410]. The NDSR database is updated annua lly to reflect marketplace changes and new 
analytic data. The program also uses the multiple pass approach , providing interview prompts to guide and 
standardize data entry, thereby [CONTACT_224411] s for the participant to recall food intake and 
improve data accuracy.  A validated visual portion guide will b e provided to the participant for use in 
determining accurate portion sizes. During the baseline visit, a CRU dietitian will obtain the first 24-hour recall 
in person, and this interview will be used to introduce and tra in the participant for the procedures used in 
subsequent 24-hr dietary recalls done by [CONTACT_648]. The remaining 2 4-hr dietary recalls will be conducted over the 
phone (taking approximately 20-40 minutes each) by [CONTACT_224412]. 
When contact[CONTACT_126059], participants will be asked to reca ll and report their dietary intake from the 
previous day’s 24-hour period.  
Urinary nitrogen excretion , a biomarker of dietary protein intake,[ADDRESS_960706] udy Depression Scale (CES-
D)33 at screening and at 6-, 12- and 18-mo follow-up. Individuals w ho score ≥16 at screening will be evaluated 
by [CONTACT_224413] (e.g., participant did not exhibit 
depressed mood or a lack of interest in activities during study  visit). In the event that a participant’s 6-, 12- or 
18-mo CES-D score increases and is above the threshold indicati ng that an individual is at risk for clinical 
depression (CES-D score ≥16) and the study team noted that the participant is exhibiting depressed mood or a 
loss of interest in daily activit ies, a letter will be sent to the participant advising them to follow-up with their 
PCP. 
The Short Form-36 Health Survey (SF-36)  will be used as a measure of quality of life and assessed at 
baseline and at 6-, 12- and 18-mo follow-up. The SF-36 measures  8 health domains: physical functioning, role 
limitations because of physical health problems, bodily pain, g eneral health perceptions, vitality, social 
functioning, role limitations because of emotional problems, an d general mental health.61 Scores for each 
health domain subscale range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better functioning or well-being. 
Activities of daily living  will be assessed using the Mobility Assessment Tool – Short Fo rm (MAT-sf) at 
baseline, 6-, 12- and 18-month follow-up. This is a novel, comp uterized tool for self-assessment of functional 
performance designed to reduce bias from factors such as age, g ender and body image.62 
Fatigue measures . The FACIT Fatigue Scale will be administered at baseline, 6-,  12- and 18-month follow-up. 
Adverse events  will be assessed by [CONTACT_224414] 12-mo follow-up to report any he alth changes, injuries, etc., and these will be 
recorded using the Adverse Event Form.   
Analytical Plan 
Sample size: The sample size chosen for this study (n=225; 75/g roup) will provide ≥80% power (α=0.05) to 
detect clinically meaningful effects of a higher protein / lowe r CHO diet during weight loss and follow-up on 
physical function (with estimated retention of 80% or 60 comple ters per group; see Table 3 ). Baseline standard 
deviations and pre-post correlations used for power analyses we re calculated using data from obese older 
adults from our OPTIMA study11 – a weight loss study with the same inclusion/exclusion criter ia as the 
proposed study. Standard deviations w ere assumed to be similar between groups. The mean group 
differences we can detect correspond to an absolute change from  average baseline values of these measures 
in obese older adults of 0.[ADDRESS_960707] been shown to be sma ll and large clinically meaningful 
differences, respectively.63  Even with a conservative drop-out rate of 20%, 60 participant s/group provides 
≥80% power (overall α=0.05, 2-sided tests for 3 comparisons) to  detect between group differences for primary 
and secondary outcomes over [ADDRESS_960708] recalculated the 
power based on the actual number of participants enrolled (tota l n=187 or ~50 per group after accounting for 
the 20% drop-out rate) using the same baseline standard deviati ons and pre-post correlations from obese 
older adults in our OPTIMA study noted above.

Database management: To fac ilitate data transfer and preserve records that can be audited,  we will use hard 
copy forms collection. Data will be entered into web-based form s on a continuous basis as collected and 
analysis datasets will be stored in SAS databases. All data wil l undergo range checks at the time of data entry 
and will be examined periodically by [CONTACT_224415] s catterplots to check for inconsistencies, unusual 
data needing further verification, and outliers. Plots of longi tudinal observations will be used to inspect for 
unusual changes that need to be verified against source documen ts. Regression diagnostics and exploratory 
analyses will be performed to find appropriate transformations of variables if needed.  
Data analysis: Initial analyses will follow the “intent-to-trea t” principle in which data from all randomized 
participants are analyzed according to their randomized groups.  Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) will be used 
for both primary and secondary aims to compare the group effect  on change in expSPPB and muscle strength 
(primary aim) and weight loss maintenance, total and appendicul ar lean mass and fat-to-lean mass ratio, and 
thigh muscle volume and inter-muscular adipose tissue (IMAT) (s econdary aim) at [ADDRESS_960710] is reduced or eliminated as an ad hoc 
mediation analysis. To compare the exploratory outcomes (bone m ineral density and cardiometabolic risk 
factors) at 6 and 18 months, ANCOVA with repeated measurements will be used, and correlations between 6 
and 18 months taken into account using a compound symmetry cova riance structure. All models will be 
adjusted for the baseline measure, age, gender, and race.  
Factors that may influence the measured responses to the interv entions (e.g., initial body weight or 
composition, changes in weight, physical activity, etc.) will b e evaluated and possibly included in secondary 
analyses. We will also consider conducting analyses adjusted fo r intervention process measures (such as 
dietary intake, average attendance at diet and exercise session s, and protein intake/urinary nitrogen) to 
examine the extent to which these contribute to the outcomes. 
Planned sensitivity analyses to assess the impact of COVID19: B ecause of the potential impact of COVID19 
on intervention delivery and follow-up assessments, we plan to conduct several sensitivity analyses: 
1) Exclude Wave 13 and 14 participants (n=26) whose interventio n was interrupted by [CONTACT_25963]19 research 
pause on March 13, 2020, and who completed the last ~2 and ~4 m onths, respectively, of the exercise 
portion of the 6-month intervention on their own while attendin g the diet portion of the intervention remotely 
(via phone). 
2) Exclude Wave 13-17 participants (n=63) whose intervention wa s interrupted by [CONTACT_4113]19 (Waves 13 and 
14; see above) or whose intervention was modified from earlier waves to accommodate safety measures 
put in place due to COVID19 (Waves 15-17; center-based exercise  reduced from 3x/week to 1-2x/week 
after week 6 to allow for physical distancing). 
3) Exclude Wave 7 participants (n=15) and participants from Wav e 6 (n=5) whose 18-month visits were 2-3 
months out of window due to the COVID19 research pause and phas ed restart of in-person research. 
Missing data considerations:  We will document withdrawal and c ompliance in detail to permit the formulation 
of reasonable assumptions regarding missing observations. If it  is determined that our outcomes are missing at 
random (MAR), we will attempt to identify baseline covariates t hat predict attrition and use these covariates to 
impute missing data based on multiple imputations (MI) and draw  inferences based on MI. If it is determined 
that our outcomes are not missing at random (MNAR), sensitivity  analyses MNAR assumptions will be carried 
out using MI following the recommendation of Molenberghs and Ke nward.[ADDRESS_960711] Recruitment Methods:  We will recruit individuals using  community-based recruitment strategies 
including newspaper ads and mass mailings. We will also adverti se in the Aging Center’s VITAL newsletter 
and participate in community outreach events.  
Informed Consent:  Written informed consent will be obtained from each study participant. The informed 
consent process will follow the procedures of the WFU Instituti onal Review Board. The study interviewers will 
explain the purpose, methods and extent of the study to prospective participants. The potential participant is 
asked to read the informed consent form and ask questions. The form will be written in simple easy to 
understand language. We require study staff to review all of th e key aspects of the study verbally with the 
potential participants. Staff is then required to question pote ntial participants to ascertain whether s/he has 
understood the information. Potential participants who are illi terate or have impaired vision must have the 
consent read to them, followed by [CONTACT_224416], oppo rtunity for questions, and discussion. This 
process will take place in a quiet, private room. A copy of the  signed and dated consent form will be given to 
participants, and the original document will be placed in subje cts’ individual study files, which will be stored in a 
secure location. In compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and the 
Standards for Privacy of Individually Identifiable Health Infor mation of the Department of Health and Human 
Services, we will access personal health information only after  obtaining informed consent. 
Potential Study Risks:  There are inherent potential risks to human subjects who participate in any research 
study and the potential risks to study participants in this study are listed below. Any injuries or illnesses (severe adverse events) during the course of a participant’s enrollment  in the study are monitored regularly as 
described below in the Data Safety Monitoring Plan.  
1)
Physical Function Testing.  There is a small risk of injury during the muscle strength te sting and
physical performance testing, such as muscle strains or pulls, falls, or joint injury. However, these tests
have been performed in large study populations w
ith no signific ant adverse events reported. Risks will
be minimized by [CONTACT_46154]/trained staff conducting the se asse ssments. A warm-up and range
of motion practice will b
e conducted before maximal strength te sting. In addition, if a participant r eports
pain, dizzine
ss, lightheadedness or other medical problem durin g the test, the test will be terminated.
2)
Radiation Exposure.  There are risks with exposure to radiat ion from the whole body, anterior-poste rior
spi[INVESTIGATOR_050], and proximal femur DXA scans and chest, abdominal, pelvic and thigh CT scans. Exposure to
radiation dur
ing the DXA (1-10 mRem each) and CT (137-255 mRem each) scans for a total of [ADDRESS_960712] scans over the three time points during the 18
months of the study which is lower than the maximal permissible  dose for occupationa lly exposed
individuals. 
The potential long-term risk from these radiation doses is uncertain, but these doses hav e
never been associat
ed with any definite adverse effects. Thus, the risk to participant s, if any, is
estimated to be slight.
3)
Blood Draw.  Participants may experience temporary pain, bru ising, bleeding and/or a  small
risk of infection, fainting or dizziness during the blood sample collection process. Blood will be draw n
only by [CONTACT_707118].
4)
Exercise testing is a common procedure with minimal risks, b ut the test is monitored by [CONTACT_707119]. These inclu de fainting, dizziness, chest pain, irr egular
heartbeats, 
or a heart attack, although the latter is extremely rare (<1 death in 10,000 tests) in p eople
with no histo
ry of heart disease. Blood pressure, heart rate an d rhythm, and breathing will be clos ely and
constantly 
monitored.
5)
Resting Metabolic Rate.  Some participants begin to feel cla ustrophobic when the clear plastic m ask is
placed over their mouth. Should this occur we will remove the mask and stop the test.
6)
Risks of weight loss.  There are no known serious risks asso ciated with using caloric restriction to  lose
weight. Changes in usual bowel function (diarrhea and/or constipation) m ay occur when beginning the
new diet due to differen
ces between the weight loss diet and the participant’s usual  diet. Under
conditions o
f rapid weight loss (more than 5 pounds per week), there is a very sm all chance of
developi[INVESTIGATOR_707115]. Risks at any age include the co ncomitant loss of le an (muscle and bone)
V08.02.[ADDRESS_960713] o f this muscle and bone loss is not known. 
In older adults, this decrease in muscle mass and bone density with weight loss may result in increased 
risk for sarcopenia and/or osteopenia/osteoporosis. Since most older adults with obesity have a higher 
muscle mass and bone density, this risk is mitigated by [CONTACT_46157]-obese and less likely to benefit from weight loss and excluding those with an increased risk for sarcopenia or osteoporosis. Individuals with T-score < -2.5 on hip or spi[INVESTIGATOR_050] D XA scan at screening will be excluded. 
Procedures to minimize loss of muscle and bone during the weight loss intervention include prescription of a caloric deficit that does not result in excessively rapid weight loss (e.g., >2 lb/week), inclusion of 
increased weight-bearing activity (exercise intervention), and incorporating dietary recommendations and 
meal plans that include the current recommended dietary allowan ce (RDA) for protein (0.8 g/kg body 
weight/d) and counseling to consume, either from food or dietar y supplements, 1200 mg/d of calcium and 
800 IU/d of vitamin D.   
7)
The risks of the higher protein diet intervention are minimal, but may include a worsening of existin g
kidney problems. However, we will not enroll individuals with e vidence of preexisting impaired kidney
function for 
whom a diet with a higher protein level is contrai ndicated (i.e., eGFR<30 based on se rum
creatinine, a
ge, gender, and race).
8)
Exercise Program.  The risks of the exercise program are minimal, but may include musculoskeletal
complications and muscle soreness in the early phases of the tr aining. This will be minimized since all
exercise sessions during
 the first [ADDRESS_960714] participants in the proper exercise techniqu es and
proper footwear (unless 
conditions arise that necessitate a transition to all home-based exercise –  e.g.,
increased 
community spread of COVID19, new restrictions on in-person research are  put in place,
and/or if sta
y at home orders are put back in place). Procedure s to minimize injury include warm-u p and
cool-down activities that 
include large muscle movements and st retching. Participants will begin with an
easier exercise stimulus 
and will gradually increase in intensity over several weeks. Exe rcise
physiologist
s, trained in cardi ac life support, will supervise all center-based exercise sessions and
practice codes are conducted quarterly. Tips on how to safely e xercise in a home-based setting will be
reviewed by [CONTACT_707120] t
he first 6 wee ks of cente r-based exercise.
Confidentiality
 and Privacy 
All data are obtained for research purposes only. Confidentiali ty of data is maintained by [CONTACT_224421]. Data will be used only in aggregate and no 
identifying characteristics of individuals will be published or presented. Results of testing will be sent to participants’ private physicians if participants agree to this.  Confidentiality of data is maintained by [CONTACT_707121]. The information collected from 
participants in this study has a low potential for abuse because the data does not address sensitive issues. 
Nevertheless, appropriate measures are taken to prevent unautho rized use of study information. Data other 
than demographic information do not use names as an identifier – the research ID number is used. The research records are kept in locked cabinets in the Geriatric R esearch Clinic. The files matching the 
participants' names and demographic information with the research ID numbers are kept in a separate room 
and locked file that uses a different key from that of all other files. A web-based data entry system will be 
created for this study which will allow access only to study st aff (user id and password required to access). 
Information linking IDs to individuals is kept on a secure, password-protected server to which only authorized study personnel will have access. Blinded staff will not have a ccess to blinded study information on the web-
based database. Computer files are stored on file servers, whic h are backed up each night and stored for easy 
retrieval in case of emergency. Files may not be obtained from the research unit by [CONTACT_224423], who are asked to sign a document agreeing t o maintain the confidentiality of the 
information. After the study is completed, the local data will be stored with other completed research studies in a secured storage area. 
Data and Safety Monitoring 
The PI, along with the study physician, will be responsible for  the overall monitoring of the data and safety of 
study participants. In addition, a ll clinical intervention stud ies conducted by [CONTACT_224424] D. Pepper Older Americans Independe nce Center’s NIH-approved Data Safety 
V08.02.[ADDRESS_960715] (DSMB). Finally, the external NIA-appointed Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will 
have overall responsibility of independently monitoring all asp ects of the study, including those that require 
access to any un-blinded data. This committee acts in an adviso ry capacity to the NIA to monitor participant 
safety, evaluate the progress of the study, review procedures f or maintaining the confidentiality of data, and the 
quality of data collection, management, and analyses. The DSMB will have access to all study data, 
documents and progress information, and will be notified of all  changes that are made to the protocol.  
The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_150199]. The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_224384]. The PI, co-
investigators, and the biostatistician will meet regularly to review study progress and to examine reports of adverse incidents as well as participant recruitment and follow -up. All serious  adverse events will be reported to 
the Institutional Review Board (IRB) and if the event occurred as a direct result of participation in this study, an 
amendment will be made to the cons ent form and the PI [INVESTIGATOR_707116]. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_130868] ([CONTACT_224427]) will meet quarterly, or as needed, to rev iew all reported events. In addition, participant 
safety in all Wake Forest Pepper Center supported studies is mo nitored by a Data and Safety Monitoring 
Committee (DSMC). It reviews study recruitment, drop-outs, protocol changes, losses to follow-up, and adverse events every [ADDRESS_960716] is enrolled in the study, even 
if the event did not occur while s/he was actively participatin g in the activities called for in the research protocol. 
Deviations from the study’s protocol are also considered an adverse, unexpected, or notable event and will be reported to the PI. 
Both major and minor events will be reported using the study’s Adverse, Unexpected, or Notable Event 
Reporting Form. Any major related and unexpected event, i.e., a ny serious injury or life-threatening event, will 
be reported immediately (within 24 hours of notification) to th e WFSM Institutional Review Board (IRB) right 
after completing any and all actions that are necessary to protect the subject’s health and safety. The SAE will 
also be reported within [ADDRESS_960717]’s research file. 
Reporting of Unanticipated Problems, Adverse Events or Deviations 
Any unanticipated problems, serious related and unexpected adverse events, deviations or protocol changes will be promptly reported by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_224386]. 
Use of biological samples by [CONTACT_224425]. The use will 
be limited to non-commercial purposes. The names and other pers onal identifiers of the study participants will 
not be sent to any recipi[INVESTIGATOR_224387]. Storage and disposal of biological material 
Blood and urine samples will be stored at Wake Forest Universit y Medical Center for up to twenty years after 
the end of the trial at which time the samples will be destroye d. Biological specimens will be stored in locked -
70oC alarmed freezers located in a locked room. The Wake Forest Pe pper Center Integrative Biology Core lab 
coordinator (Karin Murphy) and the Core Leader ([CONTACT_126080]) ha ve access to the keys of the freezers. All the 
specimens will have numerical study IDs with no personal identi fiers of the participants. These are stored 
under the Pepper Center Tissue Repository (IRB#1219).

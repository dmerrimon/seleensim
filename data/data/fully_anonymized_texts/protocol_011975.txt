WVU+kc Protocol #:  [PHONE_18850]  
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_908527]  – The two standard of care corticosteroids used for trigger finger treatment are 
betamethasone and methylprednisolone. Both injections are effective in treating trigger finger and 
the decision of which to use in treatment is currently a matter of the current practice and physician 
preference. There is no literature comparing the side effects, specifically flare reactions between 
these two treatments. Our goal through this randomized trial is to see whether there is a difference 
between these two corticosteroids in inducing flare reactions and if there are any differences in the 
peak level of pain and its duration. We will carry out a double -blinded randomized trial enrolling 
patients into one of the two treatment groups. The volume of the doses of steroid to be given will be 
standardized to 1 cc of either methylprednisolone (40 mg) or betamethasone (6 mg). We will instruct 
patients who meet the inclusion criteria to complete a visual analog scale (VAS) of their pain (1 -10) 
prior to the injection, immediately after the injection, five minutes after the injection, and once a day 
for a minimum of 7 days after the injection. The incidence, intensity, time to peak and time to 
resolution of the flare reactions (defined as a 2 -point increase from pre -injection pain) will be 
assessed and compared between the two groups. Findings indicating a statistically significant 
difference in the incidence and/or intensity of the flare reactions would be clinically significant and 
would be evidence supporting the sw itch of current standard practice to one corticosteroid over the 
other. Patients will only receive a single, standard of care, trigger finger injection on the day they 
present to the clinic. The next 7 days, up to two weeks if needed, of follow- up will onl y be a single 
short survey question to determine pain level.  
Patients will be identified by [CONTACT_908536], and will be recruited and 
consented by [CONTACT_44518]. Data will be collected from the patient and stored in the  REDCap 
server. There is not more than minimal risk involved.  
 
Study Duration  –  
Enrollment: could take up to a year, depending on how long it takes to recruit enough patients.  
Data Collection: 3 -6 months after conclusion of patient enrollment  
Analysis: 3-6 months after conclusion of data collection   
 
Section II: Design  
 
Background & Significance  
Corticosteroid injections are effective non -surgical approach to treating trigger finger (stenosing 
tenosynovitis) with success rates reported as high as 92% after just one injection [1]. Among their side 
effects is a post -injection flare of increased pain that is attrib uted to crystal -induced synovitis [2]. 
Reports of these flares in the literature have been rare. Recent evidence their incidence can be as high 
as 33% [3]. We feel they are a more common clinical issue than traditionally reported and it would be 
beneficial to control and reduce their incidence if possible.  
 
Two common corticosteroids used for trigger finger treatment are betamethasone and 
methylprednisolone [4][5]. Both injections are effective in treating trigger finger and the decision of 
which to use in  treatment is currently a matter of the current practice and physician preference. 
There is no literature comparing the side effects, specifically flare reactions between these two 
treatments. Our goal through this randomized trial is to see whether there is a difference between

the following 7 days after the injection. We estimate that we need a minimum of 30 patients in each 
group to achieve a minimum of 80% power and 0.05 significance. The incidence, intensity, time to 
peak  and time to resolution of the flare reactions (defined as a 2 -point increase from pre -injection 
pain [3]) will be assessed and compared between the two groups. Findings indicating a statistically

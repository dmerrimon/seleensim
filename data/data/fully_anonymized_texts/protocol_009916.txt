Objective: The aim of thisrecruitment plan (ADAPT-SCR) istocollect image and other dataon both digital
breast tomosynthesis (DBT) and full -field digital mammography (FFDM) from asymptomatic women
undergoing screening mammography .Thesedata will be included in a subsequent and prospectively planned
pooledanalysisdescribed in a separat e protocol (ADAPT-BIE)examining superiority of DBT to FFDM for breast
cancer diagnosis and other clinical performance measures.
Study Design: An open-label, multi -center, accrual study collecting DBT and FFDM screening images from up
to 250 asymptomatic women aged ≥[ADDRESS_1147128] cancer screening will be conducted.
CC and MLO views from bilateral GE DBT and GE FFDM (conducted before or after enro llment) within a [ADDRESS_1147129](s) for clinical management purposes. BI -
RADS® scores will be recorded. Results of biopsy(ies) and histopathology, including lesion characteristics, will
be recorded.
Subjects with negative or benign imagingfindings will be followed for approximately one year (10 -16 months)
by[CONTACT_826852] .Subjects with negative or benign histological findings
will have their images and histopathology reviewed for concordance, per the site’s standar d procedures.
Histologic concordance with imaging or evidence of negative one -year follow -up will be considered truth for
non-cancer status. A positive histology result will be considered truth for cancer.
Accrual DBT and FFDM data will be pooled for evalu ation by [CONTACT_826853] a subsequent
reader study. The detailed information on the blinded image evaluation will be provided in a separate
Independent Review Charter (IRC) detailed in the ADAPT -BIE (Blinded Image Evaluation) protocol. This study’s
primary endpoint is collection of data to compare the diagnostic accuracy of two -view SenoClaire® -GE Breast
Tomosynthesis (DBT) verses two -view FFDM based on difference in receiver operating characteristic (ROC)
area under the curve (AUC) detaile d in the separate ADAPT -BIE protocol.
Device-related adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), and device malfunctions will be recorded
and reported to Sponsor’s medical monitor and applicable authorities. No other clinical safety assessments
will be performed.

232,340new diagnoses and39,620deaths occur each year due to breast cancer, though
progress in early breast cancer detection, improved treatment, and decreased use of
menopausal hormone therapy have steadily decreased breast cancer mortality rates over the
pastthreedecades, with the most notable decreases in younger women. From 2005 to 2009,
death rates decreased 3.0% per year in women younger than 50 and 2.0% per year in women [ADDRESS_1147135] cancer patient outcomes.
Screening with conventional screen-film mammography (SFM) became widely used by [CONTACT_941] [ADDRESS_1147136] cancer mortality.10,11,12,13,14There remains
controversy, however, as to the benefit of conventional mammography alone , owing to
relatively high false positive rates and risks associated with repeat ionizing radiation exposure.7,
15,16,17A ten-year study of the risk of false positives in 9,762 screening mammograms conducted
by [CONTACT_826860].16estimated that the cumulative risk of a false positive results was 49.1% (95%
CI; 40.3-64.1%)after 10 mammograms, resulting in a $[ADDRESS_1147137] of evaluating false positives for
each $[ADDRESS_1147138] cancer screening. Furthermore, overdiagnosis has been reported to
occur in 1% to 10% of women that undergo screening mammography, and both overdiagnosi s
and overtreatment risks increase dramatically as women age, particularly above age 70.2Thus,
there is currently an urgent need for improved breast cancer screening technology and care
pathways that will enable early detection and minimize the risk of overdiagnosis and
overtreatment , particularly in aging and high risk patient populations.
While age was previously considered the key determinate characteristic for false positive risk in
mammographic sc reening, recent evidence, including the AGE trial of 53,[ADDRESS_1147139] cancer.19,20,21,22A study of 73,247
patients (46,340 mammograms) from the Washington State Mammography Tumor Registry

false positive screening mammograms, necessitating increased emphasis on breast density as a

registries indicated that the cumulative probability of false-positive mammography results was
highest among women undergoing annual mammography with extremely dense breasts who
were either aged 40 to 49 years (65.5%) or used estrogen plus progestogen (65.8%) and was
lower among women aged 50 to 74 years with scattered fibroglandular densities (30.7% and
21.9%, respectively) or fatty breasts (17.4% and 12.1%, respectively).22Further work is still
required to achieve optimal mammographic screening results, including reduction of false
positive rat es, in women with dense bre asts. The wide implementation of full -field digital
mammography (FFDM) has incrementally improved mammographic breast cancer screening, as
demonstrated by [CONTACT_826861] -film mammography i npre-menopausal women and women with dense
breasts in the National Cancer Institute -sponsored and American College of Radiology Imaging
Network (ACRIN) Digital Mammographic Imaging Screening Trial (DMIST) (335 mammograms)24,
25and in other recent studies.26,[ADDRESS_1147141] tomosynthesis (DBT ) has been reported to achieve superior accuracy in a variety
of breast tissues types, potentially reducing false positives and increasing cancer detection rates
when applied as an adjuvant to mammography.28,29,30,31Compared to conventional
mammography, DBT has also been reported to reduce false positives in noncalcified breast
tissues by [CONTACT_8622] 10% and to provide superior information on mass lesion s, focal asymmetr ies,
and architecture distortion s.32,33Further evidence is required, however, to determine the most
advantageous clinical pathways for DBT in clinical breast cancer screening and diagnosis.
This protocol is one of multipleGEHC protocols designed to collect data from asymptomatic
women who have been referred to 1) screening mammography and 2) breast biopsy following
diagnostic work-up. The data from these protocols will be pooled for analysis to compare
diagnostic accuracy of DBT to FFDM for detecting breast cancers in asymptomatic women. This
protocol will recruit initiallyasymptomatic women who have undergone clinically recommended
mammography procedures andsomewho have been recommended for bre ast biopsy because

completed a risk analysis (GEHC Breast Tomosynthesis Risk Analysis, GEHC internal document

3.1.SenoClaire®-GE Breast Tomosynthesis (DBT)
TheSenoClaire®-GE Breast Tomosynthesis is a digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) device
capable of generatingdigital mammographic images for use in screening and diagnosis of breast
cancer. The SenoClaire®-GE Breast Tomosynthesis is intended for the same clinical applicat ions
as traditional screenfilm and digital mammography systems.GE Digital Breast Tom osynthesis is
an add-ondeviceforSenographe®Essential standard FFDM systems .SenoClaire® -GE Breast
Tomosynthesis isaDBThardware andsoftware option available for new and existing
Senographe Essential platforms.
DBTreconstructed three-dimensional (3-D)imaging technology uses multiple individual low-
doseviews acquired in a limited -angle,around a compressed breast in a step-and-shoot
acquisition mode . The acquired projection images are p rocessed electronically to reconstruct
multiple in -focus planar views through the entire breast , with blurring of out -of-plane tissues.
DBT is desi gned toreduce thestructured noise of superimposed, out -of-plane tissues , which is a
limiting factor in standard 2-Dmammography.
To allow acquisit ionin a step-and-shoot mode, using partial isocentric motion, the standard
breast holder is replaced by a tomosynthesis module. Once the breast is compressed, the
systemacquires a sequence of 9 projection views, each acquired with the X-ray tube located at a

Information pertaining to the specificdesign differences between the SenoClaire®-GE Breast
Tomosynthesis and conventional mammography were included in the approved Pre -Market
Application (PMA) , which has been appro ved by [CONTACT_55257] (refer to PMA module 1) and
European CE mark . Most notably, the tomosynthesis technique used by[CONTACT_826864] (ASF). The ASF is the impulse
response of the tomosy nthesis system along the z -axis. It is sometimes used as a figure of merit
for the assessment of out -of-plane artifacts, according to the theoretical approach described by
[CONTACT_826865].37
3.2.Full-fielddigital mammography (FFDM)
GEFull-field digital mammography (FFDM) devices are integrated systems that include both the
X-ray delivery system and inte grated (non -removable) detector .Thesesystemsareintended to
be used on existing X -ray systems where the removable detector, such as a computed
radiography cassette ,replaces the film/screen detector.39These systems, such as the GE
Senographe®Essential standard FFDM platform,are widely commercia lizedand routinely used
for breast cancer screening and diagnosis .
3.3.IDI MammoWorkstation
TheIDI MammoWorkstation system will be used in this study to enable readers to view FFDM
images, as well as 3 -D DBT and synthetic 2 -DDBT images.
The IDI MammoWorksta tion can be used to review FFDM, 3 -D DBT images, and mammographic
images from other modalities.  IDI MammoWorkstation allows radiologists to smoothly navigate
through the DBT dataset using dedicated 2 -D/3-D hanging protocols and specific ergonomic
features:35
Straightforward visual identification of all series of tomosynthesis planes and slabs
Dedicated tools to review tomosynthesis data sets: cine loop, bookmarks, breast
localizer, breast height ruler
V-Preview reconstructed images from tomosynthesis
3.3.1.Volume-Preview Synthetic 2 -D Mammography (V-Preview)
Volume Preview Synthetic 2 -D Mammography (V-Preview)is the algorithmic software
developed by [CONTACT_826866] a synthetic 2 -
D view from tomosynthesis images, producing image quality designed to be similar to that of
conventional full -field digital mammography (FFDM).

5.1.Hypothesis
No statistical hypothesis is tested in this data collection study. The sample size for screening
mammography subjects in this study is determined to provide sufficient accrual of non-cancer
cases for a subsequent statisticallypowered analysisas part of a separate protocol (ADAPT -BIE).
5.2.Study Objectives
5.2.1.Primary Objective (s)
The aim of this recruitment plan (ADAPT -SCR) is to collect image and other data on both digital
breast tomosynthesis (DBT) and full -field digital mammography (FFDM) from asymptomatic
women undergoing screening mammography. These data will be included in a subsequent and
prospectively planned pooled analysis described in a separate protocol (ADAPT -BIE) examining
superiority of DBT to FFDM for breast cancer diagnosis and other clinical performance measures
5.2.2.Characteristic Objectives
An exploratory aim is todescribecancerand non-cancercasesidentified in this accrual study
based on histology findings and lesion type.
5.3.Study Endpoints
5.3.1.Primary endpoints
The primary endpoint will be the site’s diagnosis of cancer status (positive or negative/benign)
for each subject based on DBTand FFDM at baseline (0months)and 10-16 months ,and/or (if
clinically indicated) histology and surgical findings. Histologic concordance with imaging will be
assessed for benign lesions, when applicable, and DBT and FFDM im age sets will be assessed
usingBI-RADS®scores.
5.3.2.Characteristic Endpoint s
Characteristic endpoints for allsubjects will include histology findings and size, lesion type , and
other lesion characteristics based on image appearance. Technical factors of image data
collected from subjects, such as information related to radiation dose, may be extracted and
analyzed by [CONTACT_578337].
5.3.3.Safety endpoint
Device-related adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs) , and device malfunctions by
[CONTACT_826858] ( DBTandas needed, repeat FFDM)that occur during
the study will be collected .No other clinical safety assessments will be performed.

10.DATA ANALYSIS ANDSTATISTICS
10.1.Statistical Analysis Methods
10.1.1.Sample Size Justification
The projected sample size is determined by [CONTACT_826859] 120cancer cases and 250
non-cancer cases for the overall GE Healthcare SenoClaire® -GE Breast Tomosynthesis ( DBT)
development program. To achieve these overall accrual targets, the data from this study will be
pooled with data from other studies (e.g. ADAPT -BXand ADAPT -Enrich).
In thisstudy, for an enrollment of 250screening subjects, it is assumed , based on the GE -190-
001 experience, that about 185(75%) willcomplete the study with a normal 1 -year follow -up.
Approximately 2% areexpected to have a proven cancer either at screening or during follow -up
which will provide an estimated 6cancer cases.
Based on the GE-190-[ADDRESS_1147156] biopsy, approximately 33%are expected t o have a proven cancer and33% will have a
benign lesion .So,at least90cancer cases and90benign cases are expected to be accrued in the
ADAPT-BX study.
In the ADAPT -ENRICH study , for atargetenrollment of 200subjects recommended for breast
biopsy,it is assumed, based on the GE -190-003 experience, thatapproximately 33% are
expected to have a proven cancer . Thus, at least66cancer cases are expected from the ADAPT -
ENRICH study .
Inthe combined protocols (ADAPT -SCR,ADAPT-BX, and ADAPT -ENRICH), itis expected that at
least120cancer cases and250non-cancer cases will be accrued for the overall GEHC DBT
development program .
The data from this study will be pooled with data from other subjects who willberecruited from
other sources (e.g.ADAPT-BX).If necessary, data from other sources may also be included to

be used in a blinded image evaluation to analyzethe diagnostic performance of SenoClaire® -GE
Breast Tomosynthesis ( DBT)compared to FFDM through receiver operating characteristic (ROC)
analysis, sensitivity, specificity, recall rate and other analyses.
No statistical analyses are included as part of this study. A descriptive summary will be provided
for the data collected in this study.
10.1.2.Study Populations
TheEfficacyPopulation will consist of those subjects meeting the study inclusion/exclusion
criteria with no protocol violation s judged to affect the ability to evaluated the subject, whose
DBTand FFDM images are diagnostically evaluable, and whose mammography images are
available for the independent blinded evaluation regardless of the image quality. Non -available
images will include:
those lost due to corrupted media or inability of site to transport to image review
center;
subjects where no images are acquired.
The Sponsor w ill make any decisions regarding whether any subjects or any individual values
belonging to a subject will be excluded from the evaluations when a protocol violation is
considered to have a negative impact on the scientific aspects and interpretation of th e study
results. The reason(s) for any exclusion(s) will be documented in the study report.
TheSafetyPopulation will include all subjects enrolledinto the study.
10.1.3.Subject Disposition and Characteristics

11.DEVIATIONS
11.1.Management of Protocol Deviations
Deviations to the protocol may occur when necessary to protect the life or physical well-beingof
a subject.Except in an emergency, prior approval by [CONTACT_826885] ,or
planned deviations from this protocol .If these changes affect the scientific soundness or the
safety and welfare of the subject, prior EC/IRBapproval is also r equired.Planned Protocol
Deviation documentation must be filed in the Site Study Regulatory Binder .There are two types
of unplanned protocol deviations, critical deviations and non -critical deviations .All deviations
must be documented and reported, the criticality of the deviation wil l determine the reporting
path.
Critical Deviations :
Critical deviations are protocol deviations that significantly affect the safety, efficacy, integrity or
conduct of the study .
These deviations must be reported to the Sponsorno later than 5 working days from awareness
of occurrence and reported to the EC per t he deviation reporting policy .

Non-Critical Deviations :
Non-critical deviations are protocol deviations that DO NOT significantly affect the safety,
efficacy, integrity or conduct of the trial .
These deviations must be documented on the Case Report Form Protocol Deviation page and
will be reviewed by [CONTACT_11200] .
12.COMPLAINT HANDLING ANDADVERSE EVENT REPOR TING
12.1.Foreseeable Adverse Events and DeviceEffects
There are no known additional medical risks or side effects from digital breast tomosynthesis
(DBT)beyond those of conventional mammography. Expected AEs that apply to mammography
and are also applicable to digital mammography using the Senographe Essential systemmay
include but are not limited to:
Bruising;
Discomfort;
Skin irritation, abrasions, bruising or tears.
There is also the risk that imaging studies will falsely indicate an abnormality that could cause
extra procedures to be done, and ca use unnecessary anxiety for subjects .
The radiation dose for a two-viewDBTacquisition is approximately the same as for conventional
two-viewFFDMmammography . In this study, subjects must have previously undergone FFDM
on GE equipment. If they have not, they must have FFDM CC and MLO views repeated on GE
equipment .They will then undergo DBT, which has radiation dose similar to FFDM.
Patients will thus get approximately twice (three -times ifrepeatFFDM is required) the radiation
dose that they normally would if they underwent mammography outside of the clinical trial , a
dose within expected limits for routine mammography procedures and considered ALARP to
complete this study .
It is generally agreed that the risk to a fetus of radiation from a screening mammography is
extremely low; however, clinical practice is to try to determine pregnancy status of women
referred for mammography and not allow women known or suspected to be pregnant to
undergo screening mammography or other elective radiologic procedures .
12.2.Adverse Event Definitions
Adverse Event (AE) :As defined by [CONTACT_148096] [ZIP_CODE] -2011:any untoward medical occurrence,
unintended disease or injury, or untoward clinical signs (including abnormal laboratory findings)
in subjects, users or other persons, whether or not related to the investigational medical device.

Review–Introduction…
This protocol is one of twomultipleGEHC protocols designed to
collect data from asymptomatic women who have been referred to
1) screening mammography and 2) breast biopsy following diagnostic
work-up. The data from these twoprotocols will be pooled for
analysis to compare diagnostic accur acy of DBT to FFDM for
detecting breast cancers in asymptomatic women. This protocol will
recruit initially asymptomatic women who have undergone clinically
recommended mammography procedures and somewho have been
recommended for breast biopsy because of one or more
radiographically detected suspi[INVESTIGATOR_148352].Updated to clarify that
other sources may be

ProceduresBiopsy(ies) will be completed for subjects whose screening
mammography (DBT and/or FFDM) and subsequent diagnostic work -
upresults provide a clinical indication for biopsy. No biopsies will be
performed solely for research purposes as part of this study.
Percutaneous and/or open surgical breast interventions will proceed
as per standard of care at the recruiting site. A record of breast
lesion characteristics, including the type of lesi on and approximate
size based on histology and surgical findings, and l ocation of the
lesion by [CONTACT_826897] a breast quadrant will be
recorded on the CRF . The interpretation of the local pathologist will
be recorded on the CRF.
For benign/negative histopathology results, the site radiologist will
review the subject’s imaging and histopathology findings for
concordance, per the site’s standard of care, and results will be
captured on a CRF. Histologic concordance with imaging for negative
or benign lesions will be considered truth for non -cancer status. If
surgical excision is recommended even after concordance between
imaging and histopathology, the resulting histopathology from
surgical excision may be collected as part of the study. If available,
one-year follow -up data will be used to determine truth sta tus in lieu
of concordance assessments.

Size JustificationThe projected sample size is determined by [CONTACT_826898]70120cancer cases and 250 non -cancer cases for the overall
GE Healthcare SenoClaire® -GE Breast Tomosynthesis (DBT)
development program. To achieve these overall accrual targets, the
data from this study will be pooled with data from other studies (e.g.
ADAPT-BX and ADAPT -Enrich).
In this study, for an enrollment of 250 screening subjects, it is
assumed, based on the GE -190-001 experience, that about 185 (75%)
will complete the study with a normal 1 -year follow -up.
Approximately 2% are expected to have a proven cancer either at
screening or during follow -up which will provide an estimated [ADDRESS_1147189] biopsy, approximately 33% are
expected to have a proven cancer and 33% will have a benign lesion
with normal [ADDRESS_1147190] biopsy, it is assumed, based on the GE -190-
003 experience, that approximately 33% are expected to have a
proven cancer. Thus, at least 66 cancer cases are expected from the

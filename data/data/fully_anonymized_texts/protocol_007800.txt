Study Design  This is a Phase 1/2, open -label, multi -center, single -arm study conducted in 
six (6) subjects with a diagnosis of TDT.  
Eligible subjects will be enrolled and undergo apheresis to collect autologous 
CD34+ HSPCs. The CD34+ HSPCs will be treated ex vivo by [CONTACT_603781] -mRENH1 and SB -mRENH2 to manufacture the study 
drug, ST-400. Subjects will receive conditioning  therapy with intravenous 
(IV) busulfan before being infused with ST -400.  
Clinical and laboratory data will be collecte d for a total of [ADDRESS_799433]-400-01       CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY   
Page 13 of 82  © 2021, Sangamo Therapeutics, Inc.   April 9th, 2021 Treatment 
Plan CD34+ HSPCs will be mobilized in  each subject using treatment with G-CSF 
and plerixafor.  Mobilized CD34+ HSPCs  will be collected from each subject 
on Days 5 and 6 (+Day 7 if needed to secure the rescue treatment) of 
mobilization by [CONTACT_16166] . 
The collected cells of each subject will be split into [ADDRESS_799434] comprise  a minimum of 2.5 x 106 CD34+ 
HSPCs/kg . The rescue treatment portion  will be cryopreserved unmodified 
and stored at the study site for availability in the event of delayed 
hematopoietic reconstitution o r graft failure with aplasia . 
For subjects in whom the first apheresis cycle does not mobilize the minimum 
number of  CD34+ HSPCs required for ST -[ADDRESS_799435]’s clinical status.  
The remainder of a subject’s mobilized and harvested cells will be purified 
for CD34+ HSPCs and undergo transfection  with ZFN mRNAs SB-mRENH1 
and SB-mRENH2  to disrupt the erythroid-specific enhance r of the BCL11A 
gene and  yield ST-400. ST-[ADDRESS_799436]-400 for clinical use, subjects will be admitted to the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_603744] a dedicated transplant unit. Subjects will 
receive a myeloablative dose of busulfan  (3.2 mg/kg/day ; administered IV via 
central venous catheter  either once daily or  every 6 hours ) for 4 days (total 
dose of 12.8 mg/kg) . After the first dose, t he IV busulfan  dose will be adjusted 
based on pharmacokinetic s ampling to target a total area under the curve 
(AUC) of 16,000 -20,000 µmol*min. 
No sooner than [ADDRESS_799437]-400 to be administered is 3.0 x 106 cells/kg. Subjects may receive more 
than one lot of ST -[ADDRESS_799438] 3 subjects will be considered sentinel subjects and will be enrolled

measurements  spanning a minimum of 3 calendar days  (in the absence of 
platelet transfusion in the preceding 7 days) . Similarly, the third subject may 
not proceed to conditioning  or ST-[ADDRESS_799441] achieved successful hematopoieti c 
reconstitution,  all safety data from the study will be reviewed by [CONTACT_144278] (SMC) . See Section “12. Safety Monitoring ” for 
additional details . If no study suspension or stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_603745] -[ADDRESS_799442] experience delayed hematopoietic reconstitution or graft 
failure with aplasia  (defined as persistent  ANC <500 cells/µL through Day [ADDRESS_799443]-infusion), the subject  will receive the rescue treatment consisting of  
unmodified , autologous CD34+ HSPCs , and a S MC safety review will be 
performed . The rescue treatment may be administered  at any time  after 
ST-[ADDRESS_799444], 
divided into 4  study segments:  
• Screening (up to 6 weeks)  
• Mobilization , Apheresis, Conditioning  (up to 20 weeks) 
• Primary Study P eriod (starting with ST-400 infusion on Day 0; 52 weeks) 
• Follow-up Study P eriod (104 weeks)  
Subjects will be hospi[INVESTIGATOR_603746] -400 infusion . In line with typi[INVESTIGATOR_24896], 
subjects may be discharged following primary hospi[INVESTIGATOR_603747] 
(1) neutrophil recovery (defined per protocol as ANC ≥ 500 cells/µL on 3 
consecutive days) and (2) all other institutional criteria required for discharge 
following standard myeloablative autologous hematopoietic stem cell 
transplantation ( HSCT) (estimated 2 to 4 weeks; however, duration is variable 
depending on each subject’s clinical course) . Subjects  will be evaluated at the 
study center weekly until Day 42, then at Day s 56 and 90, and then every 
13 weeks until the final Week 156  visit (see Appendix 1 ).  Each subject will 
thus have a total of [ADDRESS_799445] -400 infusion.  
To assess long -term safety, subjects will be asked to participate in a separate 
long-term follow -up (LTFU) study a fter they complete this study. The total 
combined (current and LTFU studies) follow up period will last [ADDRESS_799446]-400-01       CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY   
Page 15 of 82  © 2021, Sangamo Therapeutics, Inc.   April 9th, [ADDRESS_799447] -400 will be monitored throughout the study by 
[CONTACT_603782]/SAEs. Additional safety evaluations will include:  
• Routine hematology and chemistry laboratory testing, vital signs, physical 
exam, ECG, echocardiogram (ECHO), pulmonary function tests (PFTs), 
bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], and concom itant medications.  
• Kinetics and success of hematopoietic reconstitution.  
• Duration of hosp italization after conditioning . 
• Screening for  potential development of hematological malignanc ies. 
During the conditioning  and immediate post -transplant period, subjec ts will 
be admitted to an inpatient transplant unit for treatment. Standard transplant 
medical care will be provided as per Investigator ’s judgement and study center 
practices. Additional safety precautions , assessments, and treatments 
conducted as part of  standard post -transplant medical care  outside of those 
specified in this study (e.g., clinical laboratory testing, immune function 
testing, CMV prophylaxis , G-CSF administration, etc.) will be undertaken as 
per Investigator ’s judgement and study center pr actice. All AEs, irrespective 
of whether they are related or not related to the apheresis, conditioning, or 
ST-400, will be assessed and reported.  
An external, independent SMC with appropriate medical and scientific 
expertise in TDT and HSCT will provide oversight of the study for patient 
safety. The SMC will be convened after the [ADDRESS_799448] -400 treatment.

1.1 β-thalassemia  
-thalassemia is an inherited anemia characterized by [CONTACT_603784] β -globin chain synthesis  
(Higgs & Engel, 2012 ). The defect causes an imbalance in globin chain production , and a reduction 
in hemoglobin ( Hb; which is made up of two  α-globin and two  β-globin chains) . As a consequence  
of the globin chain imbalance , unstable α -globin chain tetramers form in red blood cells (RBCs) 
or RBC precursors , and intramedullary destruction, a poptosis, ineffective erythropoiesis, iron 
overload, and profound anemia  occur (Origa, 2017 ).  
Thalassemia is considered one of the most frequent genetic diseases in the world.  It is estimated 
that about 1.5% of the global populati on are carriers of a -thalassemia mutation, with about 
60,000 symptomatic individuals born each year ( Galanello & Origa, 2010 ).  
The clinical severity of β-thalassemia is determined by [CONTACT_603785]. It defines three  clinical and hematological conditions, classically referred to as  
-thalassemia minor, -thalassemia intermedia, and -thalassemia major. Patients with 
-thalassemia minor have mild or no anemia, and are usually asymptomatic carriers. Patients with 
-thalassemia intermedia have a moderately severe anemia , and may benefit from transfusions t o 
improve their quality-of-life, but later in life often develop a t ransfusion -dependent phenotype.  
Patients with -thalassemia major have a severe anemia and require frequent blood transf usions 
for life. Although there are many combinations of -globin mutations and gen etic disease 
modifiers associated with the transfusio n-dependent phenotype, collectively the condition is 
referred to in this study as transfusion -dependent β -thalassemia (TDT)  (Galanello & Origa, 2010 ). 
Improvements in health outcomes for patients with TDT have occurred over the  past 50 years as 
the benefits of a supportive care program were recognized . The program consists of regular RBC 
transfusions , starting as soon as the diagnosis is established and anemia develops . The RBC 
transfusions are accompanied by [CONTACT_603786].  The supportive care program significantly ameliorates the 
morbidity of TDT . However, the program is  time-consuming and resource -intense: treatment of a 
single patient  in [ADDRESS_799453] $1,971,380 USD ( Koren et al., 2014 ) and 
result in 20% of treated patients having a life expectancy of less than 40 years (Modell et al., 2008 ). 
The only proven cure for TDT is allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).  
However, a llogeneic HSCT carries substantial risk of chronic morbidity (e.g., graft-versus-host 
disease [GVHD]) as well as a 10 -15% risk of death based on 5 -year mortality (Locatelli et al., 
2013; Baronciani et al., 2016 ). In addition, published reports show that  the probability of 
identifying a well -matched unrelated allogeneic donor within public registries is influenced by [CONTACT_603787][INVESTIGATOR_841]; for example, among individuals of African descent, the probability of 
finding a suitable donor is estimated to be only 19% ( Gragert et al., 2014 ). Thus, many, if not 
most, recipi[INVESTIGATOR_603749] a human leukocyte antigen (HLA) -matched donor for allogeneic HSCT , 
making this potential curative treatment unavailable .  
In conclusion, the clinical paradigm for treatment of  TDT consists of life -long maintenance of a 
complex and often morbid  supportive care regimen to prolong survival and improve  quality-of-life, 
or, if available, allogeneic HSCT to cure TDT but with risk of chronic disease and life -threatening 
complications . These options underscore the urgent ne ed for new therapi[INVESTIGATOR_603750].

Page 20 of 82  © 2021, Sangamo Therapeutics, Inc.   April 9th, 2021 1.2 Fetal Hemoglobin  
Fetal hemoglobin (HbF) is the major hemoglobin present during gestation until birth . HbF is 
generated by [CONTACT_603788] β -like globin genes, G -globin and 
A-globin, known collectively as  -globin, with -globin protein as tetramers ( 22). HbF levels 
decline progressively  after birth as -globin protein production decreases , and around 6-12 months 
of age HbF is largely replaced by [CONTACT_603789], which consists of a tetramer of β-globin and -globin 
proteins (22). Concomitant with the  decline in HbF levels, the symptoms of TDT frequently 
become clinically apparent in infants . 
HbF normally only plays a minor role  in adult physiology . However , published studies have 
demonstrated that congenital, acquired, and drug -induced increases in HbF are associated with 
reduced morbidity and improved  clinical outcomes in patients with TDT.  For example, l arge 
unbiased genetic studies identified associations between TDT disea se severity and quantitative 
trait loci such as BCL11A, Xmn1HBG2 , and HBS1L-MYB that are associated with increased levels 
of HbF ( Thein et al., 2009 ), wherein t he level of HbF in many cases was observed to be  
proportional to the de gree of attenuation of TDT symptomology (Musallam et al., 2012 ). In 
addition, there are case reports of graft rejection after allogeneic HSCT for TDT in which elevated 
HbF levels persisted serendipi[INVESTIGATOR_603751], and during which time the patients were 
transfusion -independent ( Ferster et al., 1995 ; Paciaroni & Lucarelli, 2012 ). 
1.[ADDRESS_799454] shown 
that BCL11A is an important silencer of HbF expression.  In a seminal study, dis ruption of BCL11A 
by [CONTACT_603790] -specific conditional knockout in a transgenic humanized mouse model of sickle cell 
disease (SCD) lead to  failure of hemoglobin switching , maintenance of  high-levels of HbF , and 
improvement s in hematologic and pathologic characteristics associated with SCD  (Xu et al., 2011 ). 
Inhibition of BCL11A therefore appears to  be a potentially effective strategy for treating  -globin 
disorders such as TDT and SCD in humans . However, targeting the BCL11A gene for therapeutic 
approaches poses challenges due to the crucial role of BCL11A in development and hematopoiesis  
(Brendel et al., 2016 ). An alternative strategy targets an enhancer element that is located in the 
upstream nonco ding region of the BCL11A locus. The enhancer  is required for BCL11A expression 
in erythroid cells but not in other lineages. The enh ancer was found to contain  a common genetic 
variation ass ociated with higher HbF levels (Bauer et al., 2013). It is therefore hypothesized that 
modification of this erythroid -specific enhancer of the  BCL11A gene could boost end ogenous HbF 
levels in erythroid  cells without deleterious effects on global BCL11A function (see Figure 1).

1.4 Sangamo Zinc Finger Nucleases for Therapeutic Genome Editing  
Zinc finger nucleases ( ZFNs) are engineered proteins for site-specific genome e diting. They 
combine the DNA recognition specificity of zinc finger proteins ( ZFPs) with the nuclease domain  
of the type IIS restriction endonuclease  FokI to create double -strand breaks  (DSBs) at precise ly 
defined target sites in the genome. ZFPs contain arrays of Cys2 -His2 zinc fingers, each recognizing 
approximately [ADDRESS_799455] spatial orientation.  Repair of the DSBs typi[INVESTIGATOR_603752], insertions, and deletions, termed “indels”, which can result in functional disruption 
of the target gene sequence.  
Sangamo has engineered a ZFN pair consisting of a 6 -finger ZFN (encoded by [CONTACT_603791]-mRENH1) and a 5-finger ZFN  (encoded by [CONTACT_603792] -mRENH2) that binds to a 33 base  pair 
(combined) target site in the erythroid-specific enhancer of the  human BCL11A gene (with 7 base 
pairs between the ZFP recognition sites) . Following the DSB created by [CONTACT_603793], indels are created in the enhancer with functional disruption of a binding site for the 
erythroid transcription factor GATA1 ( Vierstra et al., 2015 ; Canver et al., 2015 ) (see Figure 2). In 
a proof-of-concept study, targeted modification of the erythroid -specific enhancer of the BCL11A 
gene in hematopoiet ic stem/progenitor cells ( HSPCs) using ZFNs resulted in robust engraftment 
with high levels of HbF in an immunodeficient mouse model (Chang et al., 2017 ).

1.[ADDRESS_799456] w ith a patient’s own genetically modified CD34+ HSPCs 
is expanding as a novel curative strategy.  
Recent clinical trials in patients with SCD and TDT using autologous CD34+ HSPCs  corrected ex 
vivo by a lentiviral vector with a functional -globin transgene demonstrated improvement in 
hematological parameters and decreased transfusion requirements ( Ribeil et al., 2017 ). Although 
promising, the use of a viral vector that randomly integrates in HSPC s after gene therapy is 
concerning as th ere is a theoretical risk of malignant transformation caused by [CONTACT_603795] a CD34+ HSPC sub -population ( Stein et al., 2010 ). 
ST-[ADDRESS_799457]-400 is composed  of autologous CD34+ HSPCs in which the erythroid -specific 
enhancer of the BCL11A gene is precisely modified without the use of integrating viral vectors 
(see Figure 3). The potential benefits of ST -400 include a) reduced risk of random insertional 
mutagenesis, and b) increased efficacy in TDT and SCD due to hemoglobin switching from 
defective Hb  to HbF com pared to approaches  that rely only on the over -expression of -globin.

1.6 Preclinical Pharmacology Studie s 
Nonclinical studies were performed to support the us e of ZFN mRNAs SB -mRENH1 and 
SB-mRENH2 in clinical studies. The studies characterized CD34+ HSPCs derived from healthy 
subjects and transfected with ZFN mRNAs SB-mRENH1 and SB -mRENH2 with regard to:  
a) Level of disruption of the erythroid -specific enhancer of the BCL11A gene. 
b) Potential of the transfected CD34+ HSPCs to differentiate into erythroid progeny (including 
assessment of cellular levels of γ -globin mRNA and protein in the erythroid progeny of the 
CD34+ HSPCs) in vitro. 
c) Comparative activity and specificity of the original ZFN pair (S T-mRENH) and the optimized 
ST-400 ZFN pair (ST -mRENH1 and ST -mRENH2) in K562 cells and CD34+ HSPCs in vitro. 
d) Potential of the transfected CD34+ HSPCs  to engraft in NSG mice and differentiate into  
various hematopoietic lineages . 
1.6.1 In Vitro Studies 
For all of these studies, mobilized human CD34+ HSPCs were collected by [CONTACT_603796]. Purified CD34+ HSPCs were transfected with ZFN mRNAs SB-mRENH1 
and SB-mRENH2 . Untransfected  CD34+ HSPCs from the same sub jects served as controls. 
Forty-eight hours after transfection, the CD34+ HSPCs were harvested and frozen for use in three 
in vitro studies to determine erythroid differentiation potential of the transfected CD34+ HSPCs 
and to quantify on -target and off -target loci modification by [CONTACT_603797]-400 ZFN pair.

Page 24 of 82  © 2021, Sangamo Therapeutics, Inc.   April 9th, 2021 [IP_ADDRESS]  In Vitro Erythropoiesis  
To analyze the effects of ZFN -mediated gene editing of the  human erythroid -specific enhancer of 
the BCL11A gene, the transfected  CD34+ HSPCs wer e placed in an in vitro erythropoiesis model 
known as “cRBC pooled differentiation” ( Giarratana et al., 2011 ). Disruption  of the 
erythroid-specific enhancer of the BCL11A gene was measured by [CONTACT_603798], and 
found to be  ~75% indels, which is within the range expected during production of clinical material.  
Reversed-phase UPLC of protein samples demonstrated that the ratio of γ -globin to β-globin and 
γ-globin to α-globin was increased app roximately 3 to 4-fold in the erythroid progeny of the 
transfected CD34+ HSPCs compared to the untransfected CD34+ HSPCs. Thus, targeted gene 
modification by [CONTACT_603797] -[ADDRESS_799458] , i.e., 
elevation of γ-globin protein. Additional details are provided in the Investigator’s Brochure.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Colony-forming Unit (CFU) Potential  
For assessment of the functional potential of human CD34+ HSPCs transfected with ZFN mRNAs 
SB-mRENH1 and SB -RENH2, t he number and morphology of c olonies formed by a fixed number 
of input cells in the CFU assay was used. The results showed that transfected CD34+ HSPCs  
differentiate d into all hematopoietic lineages , including erythroid progenitors  (CFU-E and 
BFU-E), granulocyte/macrophage progenitors  (CFU-G/M/GM) , and multi -potential progenitors  
(CFU-GEMM), without significant effects on differentiation potential compared to controls . 
Additional details are provided in the Investigator’s Brochure.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Comparison of the Original and Optimized ZFN Pairs 
Clinical development for the ST-[ADDRESS_799459]-400 ZFN pair had a high level of both activity and 
specificity (>80% on -target modification  in CD34+ HSPCs, and 0.15% aggregate off -target 
indels), with a more than 260-fold improvement compared to the original ZFN pair. Additional 
details are provid ed in the Investigator’s Brochure.  
1.6.2 In Vivo Studies 
Human CD34+ HSPCs transfected with ZFN mRNAs SB-mRENH1 and SB -mRENH2  were 
assessed in vivo for their ability to engraft  in NOD/SCID/IL2rγnull (NSG) mice, maintain the 
disruption of the erythroid -specific enhancer of the BCL11A gene, and after engraftment in  NSG 
mice differentiate into erythrocytes in vitro. 
Female NSG mice were engrafted with 1 x 106 SB-mRENH1 -/SB-mRENH2 -transfected CD34+ 
HSPCs (from two healthy donors) or untransfected CD34+ HSPCs . Mice were followed for up to 
19 weeks prior to scheduled necropsy.  
All animals survived to their scheduled termination. The levels of modification at the 
erythroid-specific enhancer of the BCL11A gene were 79% and 75% in donors PB -MR-003 and 
PB-MR-004, respectively, at input after transfection, and dropped to stable levels of 42% and 50%, 
respectively, in peripheral blood cells at Week 19. Peripheral blood samples had almost identical 
modification levels as the corresponding bone marrow samples, and c omparable modification was

Page 25 of 82  © 2021, Sangamo Therapeutics, Inc.   April 9th, 2021 observed in both BCL11A -dependent ( CD19+ B cells; CD34+CD38high primitive progenitors) 
and BCL11A independent (CD33+ myeloid cells) lineages. Overall, there was no difference 
between ZFN -treated and untreated CD34+ HSPCs in engraftment of the hematopoietic lineages.  
Bone marrow was collected from the treated mice to assess for in vitro erythroid differentiation. 
The ratios of γ-globin to β-globin mRNA and γ-globin to α-globin mRNA were increased 1.5 to 
3-fold, respectively, at Week 19. UPLC analysis to determine the ratios of γ -globin to α-globin 
protein and −globin to β -like globin protein showed similar increases.  
To summarize, these studies demonstrated that CD34+ HSPCs tran sfected with the ST -400 
optimized ZFN pair had a similar engraftment and differentiation potential as control untransfected 
CD34+ HSPCs. The transfected CD34+ HSPCs were durably maintained in the peripheral blood, 
the bone marrow, and in all lineages studi ed, with gene modification levels of 42% and 50% 
detectable at Week 19 . Additional details are provided in the Investigator’s Brochure .

autologous enriched CD4+ T -cell product tran sfected ex vivo with ZFNs  that target the CCR5 
gene, in >[ADDRESS_799461] infused. SB -728-T infusions were well 
tolerated with mostly mild and moderate reversible infusion related AEs (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] for 
additional details ). 
1.8 Targeted Patient Population  
The targeted patient population of this study will be adult patients with TDT who require 8 or more 
RBC transfusion  events per year and who are medically approp riate for the apheresis, mobilization, 
and conditioning regimen .  Patients with various genotypes leading to severe beta thalassemia 
syndrome, therefore, will be considered for this study so long as they meet the clinical definition 
of TDT.  Patients with sickling disorders, including Hemoglobin S/Beta -thalassemia, wil l not be 
considered for this study.

studies to date.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  In Vitro Studies 
The in vitro studies conducted included analysis of CD34+ HSPC s derived from healthy subjects 
and transfected with ZFN mRNAs SB-mRENH1 and SB -mRENH2 with regard to presence and 
type of mutations at the erythroid-specific enhancer of the BCL11A gene, karyotype, induced DSBs  
in DNA, molecular translocation, and evaluation of potential off-target transcriptional activity .  An 
in vitro tumorigenesis study evaluated ZFN mRNAs SB-mRENH1 and SB-mRENH2 in a human 
fibroblast cell line.  
Off-Target Genome Modifications by [CONTACT_177020]-[ADDRESS_799464]-400 ZFN pair is highly specific for the erythroid -specific enhancer of the 
BCL11A gene and has but a minimal amount of detectable off -target activity. To further 
characterize candidate off -target loci and cleavage targets, indel analyses were conducted using 
MiSeq deep DNA sequencing and NextSeq ultra -deep DNA sequencing. MiSeq analysis showed 
very low levels of  off-target cleavage  of 0.15% or less. NextSeq analysis revealed extremely low 
levels of off -target cleavage of less than 0.01%. In comparison, i ndel levels at the targeted 
erythroid-specific enhancer of the BCL11A gene ranged from about 79 to 86%.  These genome 
wide analyses indicate that indel levels at the BCL11A on -target locus exceed the levels of 
modification at all identified off -target site s combined by [CONTACT_726] a factor of 300.    
To determine the significance of the minimal off -target activity, a bioinformatics approach was 
employed in conjunction with a literature review of identified loci. For all identified off -target 
events, there was  no evidence of modifications to coding regions of genes involved in critical 
hematopoietic functions. In addition, off -target events did not lead to modifications that are known 
to be associated with hematopoietic malignancies in humans. Additional detail s are provided in

protein 1 ( 53BP1) assay was used. In this assay, the 53BP1 is recru ited to sites of DSBs within 
24 hours after they occur and used to visualize the DSBs by [CONTACT_603800] 
(Schultz et al., 2000 ). The 53BP1 staining resulted in distinct bright foci marking t he locations of 
DSBs. The results of this study  demonstrated that t he induction of 53BP1+ foci was transient, 
returning to background levels by [ADDRESS_799467] -transfection . Samples collected in parallel for MiSeq 
analysis showed that gene modification at the erythroid-specific enhancer of the BCL11A gene was 
~79% indels at [ADDRESS_799468]-transfection . Thus, gene modification levels remained high as 53BP1 
immunostaining levels decreased, demonstrating that the drop in 53BP1 signal was not due to loss 
of transfected cells over time. These findings  are consistent with a transient (about 48 hour) period 
of ZFN expression and activity after transfection  and rapid repair of the DSB . Additional details 
are provided in the Investigator’s Brochure . 
Colony Formati on in Soft Agar by [CONTACT_177020] -400-Transfected Fibroblasts  
For assessment of transformation/t umorigenic potential, anchorage -independent growth of human 
WI-38 fibroblasts  transfected with ZFN mRNAs SB -mRENH1 - and SB-mRENH2 was assessed 
in a soft agar transformation  assay (Shin et al., 1975 ). Gene modification levels were measured at 
~73% indels in the genetically modified WI -38 cells compared  to ~0.3% in untransfected 
WI-38 cells. No anchorage -independent growth of the transfected and untrans fected WI -38 cells 
was observed at any time point. The results show t hat transfection  with ZFN mRNAs 
SB-mRENH1 and SB -mRENH2 , and the resultant ZFN-mediated disruption at the 
erythroid-specific enhancer of the BCL11A gene in WI-38 cells, do not promote tumorigenicity.  
Additional details are provided in the Investigator’s Brochure . 
Molecular Translocation by [CONTACT_177020]-400 ZFN Pair  
In depth characterization of rare translocation events occurring between the on -target locus 
(erythroid -specific enhance r of the BCL11A gene) and all known sites of off -target cleavage was 
conducted using a TaqMan -based assay developed by [CONTACT_603801] [ADDRESS_799469] two of the off -target sites, with translocation frequencies ranging from 1 in 105 to 2 in 
107 genomes. To determine the significance of these rare translocations, a bioinformatics approach 
was employed in conjunction with a literature  review. None of the identified translocation events 
were known to be associated with hematopoietic malignancies in humans. Additional details are 
provided in the Investigator’s Brochure .

Page 28 of 82  © 2021, Sangamo Therapeutics, Inc.   April 9th, [ADDRESS_799471], the expression levels of the 11 genes flanking the BCL11A gene were 
similar to those of the 11 genes in the control cells. Expression levels of 4 other genes regulated 
by [CONTACT_244401]1 ( KLF1, SCL4A1, ZFPM1 and ALAS2) also were not affected. These results show that 
the activity of ZFN mRNAs SB-mRENH1 and SB -mRENH2  is restricted to repression of BCL11A 
gene transcript ion and its consequent downstream effects. Additional details are provided in the 
Investigator’s Brochure . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  In Vivo Studies 
A previously conducted in vivo animal study found that a knockout of the mouse erythroid -specific 
enhancer of the BCL11A gene has no significant effects on erythropoie sis other than elevation of 
γ-globin levels  (Smith et al., 2016 ). 
To evaluate the potential tumorigenicity of ZFN -transfected HSPCs , an in vivo animal study was 
conducted in immune -deficient NSG mice . NSG mice are considered an optimal model for such 
studies because they accept transplantations of human HSPCs and establish long -lived grafts of 
the HSPCs and their progeny ( Christianson et al., 1997 ; Shultz et al., 2005 ). The mice were 
engrafted with human CD34+ HSPCs derived from healthy subjects and transfected with  ZFN 
mRNA SB-mRENH. SB -mRENH encodes  the original two BCL11A enhancer-specific ZFNs, 
which are known to result in qualitatively equivalent gene modification at the erythroid-specific 
enhancer of the BCL11A gene as the optimized ZFN mRNAs SB-mRENH1 and SB -mRENH2 . A 
total of 325 pre -conditioned female NSG mice were engrafted with 1 x 106 SB-mRENH-
transfected HSPCs (n = 225) or untransfected HSPCs (negative control; n = 100), and maintained 
for up to 20 weeks prior to a scheduled necropsy. The engrafted m ice were observed daily for 
evidence of AEs, underwent detailed clinical observation twice weekly, and were weighed weekly .  
The cell dose of 1 .0 x 106 CD34+ HSPC per mouse is approximately 5 .0 x 107 cells/kg (assuming 
a 20 g mouse), which is 5 -fold higher than the target clinical dose (1.0  x 107 cells/kg) for patients.  
As 225 mice received 1.0 x 106 ZFN-treated cells, a total of 2.25 x 108 cells were evaluated in the 
tumorigenicity study.  
MiSeq deep sequencing confirmed that gene modification levels at the erythroid -specific enhancer 
of the BCL11A gene of 43% or greater throug hout the study until completion of the experiment at 
Week 20. FACS analysis and multi -lineage differentiation of HSPCs showed successful 
engraftment, with hematopoietic progeny measured in blood and bone marrow of all animals 
during this study. Survival to  study termination was ~95% (307/325), with 18/325 unscheduled 
deaths. Nine of the 18 early deaths were pr ocedure- or husbandry -related. The remaining 9 deaths 
(2 in the untransfected control group, 7 in the ZFN -transfected group) were mice euthanized in 
poor clinical condition, mostly related to bone marrow hypoplasia caused by [CONTACT_603803].  
In surviving animals, there were no significant differences in mean body weights o r body weight 
gain between anim als that received transfected or untransfected HSPCs over the course of the 
study.  There were no treatment -related effects on peripheral blood and bone marrow morphology  
or lymphocyte counts.  There were no pathologic findings related to administration of BCL11A 
enhancer-modified CD34+ HSPC or neoplasms shown to be of human origin.

4.1 Overview 
This is a Phase 1 /2, open-label, multi-center, single-arm study.  
A total of five (5) to s ix (6) subjects with a diagnosis of TDT will be enrolled and treated.  
Eligible subjects will be enrolled and undergo apheresis to collect autologous CD34+ HSPCs. The 
CD34+ HSPCs will be treated ex vivo by [CONTACT_603804] -mRENH1 and 
SB-mRENH2 to manufacture the study drug , ST-400. ST-[ADDRESS_799478] will serve as their own 
control to provide reference data for evaluation of change from baseline of the study assessments , 
including transfusion require ments and circulating Hb and HbF levels .  
4.3 Number of Subjects  
Six (6) subjects who satis fy all eligibility criteria will be enrolled and treated in this study. Enrolled 
subjects who do not receive ST -[ADDRESS_799479] to follow -up or withdraw from the stu dy before  
the Week 26 visit in the Primary Study Period (beginning with ST -400 infusion) will be replaced.  
The first [ADDRESS_799480] -400 is 3.0 x 106 cells/kg, administered IV no sooner than [ADDRESS_799481] -400 required in this study exceeds the generally recommended minimum cell 
dose of 2.0 x 106 CD34+ HSPCs /kg for autologous HSCT (Duong et al., 2014 ). To achieve the 
highest likelihood of efficacious ST -[ADDRESS_799482] -400 is 
10 x 106 cells/kg, and the maximum dose that may be given is 20 x 106 cells/kg. 
To put the human cell dose in perspective to the number of t reated cells evaluated in the 5 -month 
NSG mouse tumorigenicity study, t he mouse cell dose of 1 .0 x 106 CD34+ HSPC  is approximately 
5.0 x 107 cells/kg, which is 5 -fold higher than the target clinical dose (1.0  x 107 cells/kg) for 
patients.  As [ADDRESS_799483]-400-01       CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY

and will be performed across several visits  as detailed below.  
7.3.1 CD34+ HSPC A pheresis  
Subjects who have signed the ICF and meet all the eligibility criteria will be scheduled for CD34+ 
HSPC mobilization . Sangamo should be contact[CONTACT_603807]34+ 
HSPC mobilization to ensure availability of the ST-400 manufacturing facility.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  G-CSF and Plerixafor Mobilization and Apheresis  
CD34+ HSPCs will be mobilized in  each subject followi ng G-CSF administration on Days 1 -6 of 
mobilization  (plus Day 7 if rescue treatment is collected on Day 7 ) and plerixafor administration 
prior to apheresis on Days 5 and 6 (plus Day 7 if rescue treatment is collected on Day 7). Timing 
of plerixafor adminis tration with respect to the start of apheresis may be approximately 10 to 
12 hours before apheresis; timing of both G -CSF and plerixafor is at the discretion of the 
Investigator . Within this timeframe, apheresis and mobilization may be started earlier and/ or 
discontinued earlier based on institutional practices, cell yields, and Investigator ’s judgement. 
Splenectomized subje cts will receive a reduced dose  of G-CSF, with further dose adjustment as 
necessary to target a WBC below 100,000 cells/ L. G-CSF and p lerixafor dosing, timing, or route 
of administration may be modified or discontinued at the discretion of the Investigator  if the WBC 
exceeds 100,000 cells/ L or if the subject becomes symptomatic . Detailed guidelines for 
administering  G-CSF and plerixafor  are provided in  the Study Cell Therapy Manual . 
It is strongly recommended that a vascular access consultation be obtained before the mobilization

to be performed at unscheduled visits will be at the Investigator ’s discretion in consultation with 
the Sponsor, and may be based on those l isted in the Schedule of Events ( see Appendix 1 ). 
7.[ADDRESS_799522] Withdrawal and Discontinuation from Study  
Subjects may withdraw or should be discontinued from the study for any of the following reasons:  
• Request by [CONTACT_44681] . 
• Request of S ponsor or Investigator  if he or she thinks the study is no longer in the best 
interest of the subject .

• At the discretion of the institutional review board ( IRB), Office for Human Research , 
regulatory authority (e.g., FDA), Investigator , or Sponsor. 
Subjects will be strongly encouraged to continue and comply with follow -up safety evaluations. If 
a subject withdraws consent or discontinues from the study post -study treatment, a conference 
between the Investigator  and Medical Monitor will take place to ensure and document that the 
subject understands the importance of the study follow -up and that the study treatment cannot be 
revised even if a subject drops out of the study follow -up. If the subject agrees, a reduced follow -up 
testing schedule may be arr anged including telephone call and safety labs to assess 
treatment -related AEs and disease status.

8.2 Intravenous Busulfan  
This protocol will exclusively use IV busulfan; oral administration will not be allowed.  
Busulfan is a bifunctional alkylating age nt that causes DNA -DNA crosslinks and triggers cell 
apoptosis. Because it specifi cally affects non -dividing stem  cells in the bone marrow, busulfan is 
used either alone or in combination with other agents (e.g., cyclophosphamide) as the 
myeloablative conditioning agent of choice for allogenic and autologous HSCT.  
8.2.1 Inventory, Storage, and Handling  
Please refer to package insert.  
8.2.2 Administration  
Please refer to package insert.  
For detailed guidance on IV busulfan therapeutic drug monitoring and dose adjustment based upon 
pharmacokinetic s ampling, refer to  the Study Cell Therapy Manual . 
8.2.3 Precautions  
Please refer to the busulfan package insert for complete safety information .  
8.3 G-CSF 
G-CSF is a 175 amino acid polypeptide that regulates the produc tion of granulocytes  within the 
bone marrow  and affects neutrophil progenitor proliferation, differentiation , and activation. In 
addition, G -CSF is a potent inducer of CD34+ HSPC  mobilization from the bone marrow into the 
bloodstream. G-CSF may be administered by [CONTACT_603814].  Pegylated G -CSF 
should not be used. G-CSF and fil grastim are used interchangeably  in this protocol.

8.4 Plerixafor 
Plerixafor  reversibly inhibits binding of stromal cel l-derived factor -1-alpha (SDF -1α), expressed 
on bone marrow stromal cells, to the CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4), resulting in 
mobilization of CD34+ HSPCs  from bone marrow into peripheral blood. Plerixafor used in 
combination with G-CSF results in synerg istic increase in CD34+ HSPCs mobilization .

If the diagnosis of hematological malignancy is confirmed, a study suspension rule  will have been 
met, and all enrollment/dosing will be halted. An SM C will then convene and review all data to 
provide recommendations on the future of the study.  
In addition  to the clinical monitoring described above , for each subject the presence or absence of 
clonal populations will be assessed over time using high -throughput sequencing technology.  If

Hematopoietic “clonal dominance” based on indel analysis will trigger a clinical work -up for the 
evaluation of hematological malignancy (see Section 9.16).  “Clonal dominance” is defined 
using the following algorithm based  on the dominant indel detected:  
• If the dominant indel is ≥90% of the whole at any time in any bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337],

Cardiac abnormalities, in cluding heart failure and fatal arrhythmias, are major complications of 
TDT and frequent causes of death. Life -long transfusion therapy ameliorates cardiac pathology; 
however, TDT patients frequently develop cardiac hemosiderosis due to myocardial iron 
deposition. Cardiac MRI is the standard for evaluation  of iron deposition in the myocardium,

drug. 
10.[ADDRESS_799556] medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans,  whether 
or not considered drug -related. An AE can  include any of the following events that develop or 
increase in severity during this study: 
• Any sign, symptom, or physical examination finding that worsens in nature, severity, or 
frequency compared to baseline  status (i.e., prior to screening) , whether thought to be related 
or unrelated to the condition under st udy. 
• Any clinically significant laboratory abnormality or laboratory abnormality that requires 
medication or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] . Abnormal laboratory results will be graded based on Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events ( CTCAE) 5.0 criteria. An asymptomatic Grade 1 or 
2 clinical laboratory abnormality should be reported as an AE only if it is considered clinically 
significant by [CONTACT_737] . A Grade 3 a nd 4 clinical laboratory abnormality  that represent s 
an increase in severity from baseline should be reported as an AE if it is not associated with a 
diagnosis already reported on the CRF.  
• All events associated with the use of ST-400, including those occurring as a result of an 
overdose, abuse, withdrawal  phenomena, sensitivity, or toxicity to ST-400. 
• Concurrent illness . 
• Injury or accident . 
A pre-existing condition is one that is present prior to screening , and is to be reported as part of 
the subject’s medical history. It should be reported as an AE only if the frequency, intensity, or the 
character of the condition worsens during study treatment.  
10.2 Classification  of an Adverse Event  
The Investigator  is responsible for determining  
• if the AE meets the criteria for an SAE,  
• the relationship of the AE to study treatment, and 
• the severity of the AE. 
10.2.1  Definition of a Serious Adverse Event  
A SAE is any AE  that in the view of either the Investigator  or Sangamo results in any of the 
following outcomes:  
• Death. 
Sangamo Therapeutics , Inc.  
ST-400-01       CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY   
Page 63 of 82  © 2021, Sangamo Therapeutics, Inc.   April 9th, 2021 • Life-threatening threatening event  (i.e., an event that places the subject at immediate risk 
of death); however, this does not include an event that, had it occurred in a more severe 
form, might have caused death.  
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] . 
• Persistent or signifi cant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal 
life functions . 
• Congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of an exposed subject . 
• A medically important event.  
A medically important event is an AE that may not result in deat h, be life-threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] , but may be considered serious when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, 
the AE may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one 
of the outcomes listed above. (Examples of such medical events include but are not limited to 
allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood 
dyscrasias , or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] .) 
10.2.[ADDRESS_799557]-400 treatment.  Additional information will be collected on suspected relationship to study 
procedures (i.e ., apheresis) and/or other protocol -required medications (i.e., plerixafor, G -CSF, 
and busulfan).  
The following definitions should be considered when evaluating the relationship of AEs and SAEs 
to ST-400 treatment, study procedures , and/or other protocol -required medications.  
• Not related  
An AE will be considered “not related” to the use of the investigational product or study 
procedures if there is not a reasonable possibility that the event has been caused by [CONTACT_603816]. Factors pointing toward this 
assessment include but are not limited to the lack of reasonable temporal relationship 
between administration of the product and the AE, the presence of a biologically 
implausible relationship between the product and the A E, or the presence of a more likely 
alternative explanation for the AE.  
• Related  
An AE will be considered “related” to the use of the investigational product or study 
procedures if there is a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by [CONTACT_3433] e 
product under investigation or the study procedures. Factors that point toward this 
assessment include but are not limited to a positive rechallenge, a reasonable temporal 
sequence between administration of the product and the AE, a known response patter n of 
the suspected product, improvement following discontinuation or dose reduction, a 
biologically plausible relationship between the product and the AE, or a lack of an 
alternative explanation for the AE.

Page 64 of 82  © 2021, Sangamo Therapeutics, Inc.   April 9th, 2021 10.2.3  Determination of Severity of Adverse Event 
Severity will be categorized by [CONTACT_603817] (CTCAE) Version 5.0. AEs not listed in the CTCAE Version  5.0 will be evaluated 
by [CONTACT_88550]:  
• Grade 1:  Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated.  
• Grade 2:  Moderate; minimal, local , or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting 
age-appropriate instrumental activities of daily living.  
• Grade 3:  Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_23566]; disabling; limiting self -care 
activities of daily living.  
• Grade 4:  Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.  
• Grade 5:  Death related to AE.   
In the event of death, the cause of death should be recorded and reported as an SAE. “Death” is 
not the AE; “death” is an outcome. The term “death” should be reported as an SAE only if the 
cause of death is not k nown and cannot be determined. If an autopsy is performed, a copy of the 
autopsy report should be obtained if possible. The Investigator should make every effort to obtain 
and send death certificates and autopsy reports to Sangamo.  
10.2.4  Determination of E xpectedness of Adverse Event

SIGNIFICANTLY ALTERED  OXYGEN AFFINITY  
HbF structural variants are rare. Although  some HbF variants have no clinical significance , there are 
HbF mutations that lead to unstable hemoglobin or hemoglobins with deleter iously altered oxygen 
affinity. All subjects will have sequencing of the γ-globin gene evaluated at S creening. Subjects with 
γ-globin mutations that have clinical significance are not e ligible to participate in this study.  Examples 
of known clinically-significant γ -globin variants are provided below (not inclusive list):  
• Hb F-Poole 
• Hb F-M Osaka 
• Hb F-La Grange  
• Hb F-Cincinnati  
• Large deletions such as γβ -thalassemia or εγδβ -thalassemia

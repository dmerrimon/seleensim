Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is the most commonly
occurring neurodevelopmental disorder in the US. Common treatments are
stimulant medications and counseling but these practices are not always
feasible or acceptable due to adverse side-effects, cost, and poor adherence.
As such individuals remain at risk for poor outcomes. ADHD is considered to
be a result of a disruption of select physiological systems and related under-
arousal of parts of the brain involved in executive functioning (EF). Our
previous research indicates that Animal Assisted Intervention (AAI) with dogs
is effective for improving outcomes related to EF deficits (Schuck, et al.,
2018a; 2018b). The mechanisms by [CONTACT_666033], is not yet understood. These gaps in understanding hinder
progress in the application of AAI, limiting the acceptability and availability of
this integrative healthcare practice. We contend that dogs elicit physiological
responses related to arousal of EF systems, thereby [CONTACT_666034]. Furthermore, individual differences potentially mediate outcomes.
This purpose of this research is to replicate our previous work(Schuck,
Emmerson, Fine, & Lakes, 2015; Schuck et al., 2018a; 2018b), to determine if
physiological responses to AAI change over time, and to ascertain if individual
differences during AAI mediate findings. To explore these hypotheses our
research procedures will include conducting an exploratory parallel-group
randomized controlled clinical trial with 48 young children with ADHD,
participating in intervention with/without AAI during which we will collect and
analyze physiological measures (candidate salivary analytes and heart-rate-
variability) thought to play an important role in AAI for children with ADHD.Instructions2/1/25, 11:27 AM Protocols

Background & Purpose of the Research2/1/25, 11:27 AM Protocols
https://uci.kuali.co/protocols/protocols/63505c686cc2b00029eec278/print 23/63
Describe the purpose, specific aims or objectives and specify the hypotheses or research
questions to be studied:
The purpose of this research is to address gaps in understanding of the
mechanisms of AAI and how these mechanisms may differ across special
populations hinder progress in the application of AAI, and limit the
acceptability and availability of this integrative health care practice. Our bio-
social mechanistic hypothesis contends that dogs elicit physiological
responses related to arousal of EF systems, thereby [CONTACT_666034]. Furthermore, candidate individual differences potentially mediate
outcomes. This work will explore these hypotheses; 1) we suspect AAI will
result in enhanced social-behavioral outcomes and improved diurnal patterns
of HPA and ANS activity for these children and 2) we suspect acute
physiological responses to AAI (markers of HPA &amp; ANS) and social
interaction quality (child/child and child/dog) will mediate main outcomes.
Specific Aims Specific Aim 1: To replicate previous findings that social-
behavioral outcomes are improved for children with ADHD when they
participate in an 8- 10 week manualized AAI with therapy dogs. Specific Aim
2: To explore if diurnal patterns of physiological markers of Hypothalamic
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_666014] (HPA) activity (salivary cortisol; Cort and uric acid; sUA)
and Autonomic Nervous System (ANS) activity (heart-rate variability; HRV, and
salivary alpha-amylase; sAA) are improved over time for children with ADHD in
response to an 8- 10 week manualized AAI with therapy dogs. Specific Aim 3:
To explore if potential individual differences in children with ADHD are
manifested during intervention sessions and if these differences mediate
primary and exploratory main outcomes from an 8- 10 week manualized AAI
with therapy dogs. Specific individual differences explored include; acute
physiological responses during intervention sessions as measured by
[CONTACT_666040] &amp; ANS activation (Cort, sUA, sAA, &amp; HRV) and the
quality of social interaction (child/child and child/animal) during sessions.2/1/25, 11:27 AM Protocols

Provide the scientific or scholarly rationale for the research and describe the relevant
background information and the specific gaps in current knowledge that this study intends to
address:
This project explores physiological mechanisms thought to underlie the
positive effects of AAI for children with ADHD and posits that interaction with
dogs during treatment improves social behavioral and physiological
outcomes and that individual differences in bio-markers and interaction style
mediate outcomes for this group. Rationale & Background Despi[INVESTIGATOR_666015], the condition
remains a significant public health problem adversely impacting individuals,
families and schools. The annual cost of ADHD is estimated at $266 billion
(Doshi et al., 2012). Pharmacotherapy (e.g., methylphenidate) is the mainstay
of traditional medical intervention for ADHD, but treatment failures are
common (Caye, Swanson, Coghill, &amp; Rohde, 2018; Schneider &amp;
Enenbach, 2014; Swanson et al, 2018), and affected children often require
medications during what are now recognized as critical periods of growth and
development. It is not surprising that parents find alternative therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014],
including Animal Assisted Intervention (AAI), to be more acceptable than
medication (Rabbit, Kazdin, &amp; Hong, 2014). Our research found AAI to be
effective in reducing ADHD symptoms and improving social skills and self-
perception (Schuck et al., 2015; Schuck et al., 2018a, Schuck et al., 2018b).
Gaps in Current Knowledge While we demonstrated the effectiveness of AAI
for this group, the underlying mechanisms of these effects is unknown; a
critical gap in our developi[INVESTIGATOR_666016]. The
research proposed in this application will break ground in this nascent area
and contribute to the rapi[INVESTIGATOR_666017] (1)
contributing to our understanding of bio-social mechanisms which may
underlie outcomes, (2) identifying individual responses thought to mediate
outcomes and (3) informing the development of future large scale, multi-site
trials aimed to informing best practices for delivering AAI in special pediatric
populations and improving accessibility to this practice.Provide relevant preliminary data (animal and/or human):

children will participate in treatment and assessment for a total up to
approximately 16-20 hours) and parents will participate in approximately 6-[ADDRESS_899511] 2-3 hours to determine eligibility. e. If eligible,
participation will require participants to attend group sessions for integrative,
non-medical treatments for ADHD, once weekly (one weekday after school to
be determined as space permits for about 2 hours per session (for a total of
about 16-20 hours). These play group sessions may or may not include the
participation of up to 3-4 certified therapy dog/handler dyads. These group
sessions will be video recorded to capture child-child, child-dog, and dog
behavior. f. Participation will also require child participants to attend three (3)

Describe the statistical methods for the stated specific aims and hypotheses. Your analysis
plans should match the stated study specific aims and hypotheses:
Statistical Method per Outcome Specific Aim 1: Replicate Previous Favorable
Behavioral Response to AAI Primary Main Outcome: Behavior responses. This
parallel-group randomized design and will utilize a multi-method and multi-
source assessment protocol. The assessment protocol will use a repeated-
measure within-subject design, gathering main outcomes at three time points
to assess the efficacy of AAI on outcomes for children with ADHD who are
participating in a short-term intervention with or without the assistance of
certified therapy dogs (see Figure 1). Our previous research indicated that
after just [ADDRESS_899514] intervention (Schuck et al., 2018a), suggesting
that [ADDRESS_899515] significant benefits
from AAI with dogs. Outcomes from AAI utilizing a manualized treatment with
therapy dogs (AAI) will be compared to standard of care evidence-based
psychosocial treatment at usual (control). Specific Aim 2: Determine
Physiological Response over time to AAI for children with ADHD. Exploratory
Main Outcome: Diurnal HPA and ANS responses. To determine if children with
ADHD present with measurable changes in physiological responses to a
short-term AAI (10 weeks) on measures of HPA and ANS we will gather
candidate salivary analytes (salivary cortisol, uric acid, and alpha-amylase;
Cort, sUA, sAA, respectively) and measures of cardiac rhythm, (heart rate
variability; HRV) prior to and post intervention for children participating in both
treatment conditions before, immediately after, and upon treatment follow up.
Specifically, for each domain we will ascertain changes in diurnal patterns of
candidate physiological measures utilizing a linear, repeated measures design
gathered across three (3) points in time; establishing individual baseline
patterns, end of treatment patterns, and then patterns at [ADDRESS_899516]-
treatment. Specific Aim 3; Explore Individual Differences as potential
mediators of response to AAI in children with ADHD. Secondary Outcome
Exploratory Mediator Analysis; In the proposed study, we will explore how
children’s individual (a) acute physiological responses during intervention
sessions and their individual (b) social interaction quality during intervention
sessions may play a role in each of the Main Outcomes. Specifically, we will a)
ascertain acute HPA activity (as measured by [CONTACT_666044], and sUA) and acute ANS
activity (as measured by [CONTACT_666045]) during intervention sessions across2/1/25, 11:27 AM Protocols
https://uci.kuali.co/protocols/protocols/63505c686cc2b00029eec278/print 41/63
both treatment conditions and we will b) ascertain the quality of in-session
social relationships (child-child) across both treatment conditions as well as
the quality of in-session child animal interaction (child-dog) during the AAI
sessions (observed child/child & child/dog interaction) at three (3) time
points across the 10-week study intervention period (weeks 1, 5, & 10). The
acute response and interaction quality measures from each of the three
sessions will then be correlated with the degree of change in the primary main
outcomes. (e.g., pre-post change in ADHD symptoms, social skills, regulation)
and the exploratory main outcomes (e.g., pre-post change in diurnal HPA
activity and ANS activity) to examine the potential mediation of individual
differences on response to AAI with therapy dogs for children with ADHD.
Here we provide an example of one mediation analysis for treatment group
(AAI vs Control) as the primary predictor, salivary cortisol response slope at
session 5 the potential mediator, and behavioral change (pre-post change) the
outcome: First, cortisol response slope2 means will be compared between
the groups (the mediator must be related to the predictor). If significant, then
the relationship between cortisol response slope2, and behavioral change will
be evaluated for a significant correlation/slope (the mediator must be related
to the outcome). Finally a model will be run with both treatment group and
cortisol response slope2 predicting behavioral change. If the relationship
between treatment group and behavioral change is reduced compared to the
primary analysis (i.e., with treatment group alone), saliva cortisol response2 is
interpreted as providing a mediated effect. To obtain estimates of the size
and significance of the indirect effects, bootstrappi[INVESTIGATOR_666022] (2002) will be implemented. Due to the fact
that bootstrappi[INVESTIGATOR_666023], an approximation of the Sobel test will also be performed, along with
Monte Carlo estimation of confidence intervals but because this aim is
exploratory and this is not a fully powered study, results presented will include
descriptive and confidence intervals.Describe the statistical method(s) that will be used to analyze the primary outcome(s) or
endpoints:

exploratory analysis and if necessary, provide a breakdown of the methods used per outcome or
endpoint:
Statistical Method to Inform Randomization Bias: Intent to treat bias. To
establish equivalence of randomly assigned groups pre-intervention, t-tests
will be performed on outcome measures comparing the groups. Means and
standard deviations will be obtained and effect sizes calculated. Demographic
profiles will be obtained and bivariate significant tests performed to assess
the balance expected with randomization. Cohort effects on outcome as well
as participation rates will be evaluated to assess any bias related to location,
calendar time, or other session characteristics. Participation rates across the
intervention will be tracked and compared between the randomized groups. In
the spi[INVESTIGATOR_666024] (White, Carpenter, and Horton 2012)
every effort will be made to conduct follow-up assessments on all
randomized participants. Withdrawals will be documented with reason
provided. In addition, multi-level modeling allows all cases to remain in a
repeated measures model and will be done as a sensitivity analyses to
primary analyses done on individuals with at least one follow-up point.2/1/25, 11:27 AM Protocols
https://uci.kuali.co/protocols/protocols/63505c686cc2b00029eec278/print 43/63
Sample Size Determination: Explain how the overall target sample size was determined (e.g.,
power analysis; precision estimation), providing justification of the effect size for the primary
outcome based on preliminary data, current knowledge/literature and/or cost consideration; if
appropriate, provide sample size justification for secondary outcomes. Power analysis should (at
least) match the primary outcome/endpoint:Sample Size. This exploratory study will employ a parallel-group randomized
clinical trial design in which 48 participants will be randomly allocated to one
of two (2) treatment/intervention groups (AAI and Control) delivered across
four (4) cohorts in two (2) waves over the span of two (2) years (n = 12 per
parallel ten-week cohort) in efforts to inform the specific aims of the study.
Power & Expected Effect Size. Sample size analysis was conducted for
randomized controlled design, using SAS PROC power. For the primary
analysis of the main outcome domain (Aim 1: ADHD Behavior) with type I
error rate of .[ADDRESS_899518], as well as the
group*treatment interaction. Effect size estimates from the authors’ previous
parallel-group randomized study of HAI demonstrated large AAI vs control
effect size for problem behaviors (.86) and moderate effects on inattention
(.45) (Schuck et al., 2018a). For Aim 1, with a projected analysis of n=48, this
exploratory study will exceed 90% power to detect effect sizes of .19 and
above. At a level of 80% power, the minimum detectable effect was
determined to be .21. For Aim 2, n= 48 will, for each of the two primary
physiological outcome domains (Aim 2: Diurnal Pattern Hypothalamic
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_666025]; HPA and Autonomic Nervous System activity;
ANS), a multilevel model will be constructed to assess pre-post intervention
change, post-follow up change, group differences at each assessment, and
group differences in degree of change. Models will account for within-subject
correlation and within-cohort correlation. Four (4) cohorts of 13 participants
each will be recruited for a total enrolled target sample size of 52 families
over Years 1 and 2, accounting for an anticipated attrition rate of about 8%
which is based on our recently completed study of AAI with ADHD (Schuck, et

Risk Assessment
Risks and Discomforts
1. Describe and assess any reasonably foreseeable risks and discomforts associated with each
procedure for each subject population — physical, psychological, social, legal or other:
2. If this study will involve the collection of identifiable private information, even temporarily, for
which the disclosure of the data outside of the research could reasonably place the subjects at
risk, include the risk of a potential breach of confidentiality:
The greatest potential risk for children interacting with dogs include the danger of an animal bite or
that a dog might carry diseases with potential transmission to humans. 
Also, should there be a breach in confidentiality of data, there is a slight risk that private health
information could be shared with individuals who are not members of the study team. 
This study involves the collection of participant identifiable data (even if temporary such as for
recruitment or compensation purposes), and as such, a breach of confidentiality is a risk associated
with the research.2/1/25, 11:27 AM Protocols

risks/potential discomforts to subjects:
Though these are potential dangers, risks of interacting with participating
therapy dogs are minimized by a strict safety screening protocol including a
review of animal health, history, certification by [CONTACT_666046], and dog/handler interview. This safety protocol
was developed in a prior study by [CONTACT_666047]-
one children and over a dozen therapy animals over the course of 4 years and
resulted in zero incidents of injury or disease transmission (Schuck,
Emmerson, Abdullah, Stehli, Fine, & Lakes, 2018) and has since been used in
clinical treatment in a wide variety of settings across the nation for over [ADDRESS_899521] during moderate to heavy physical activity, and
is safe and acceptable in children ages 7-9 [Martinez, et al, 2016]. Additionally,
this device has been found safe and feasibly deployed in studies in both
typi[INVESTIGATOR_666026] 4 years of
age [Jerger et al., 2018, Riquelme, et al, 2018]. There is a minimal risk of
discomfort from removing the adhesive discs, similar to removing an
adhesive bandage. Wipi[INVESTIGATOR_666027] a clean cloth or alcohol prep pad will
minimize the risk of irritation. All paper and digital records and saliva samples
are de-identified using a coding system in which there is only one linking
document for record keepi[INVESTIGATOR_007], recruitment and compensation purposed. Only
the LR and the study coordinator have access to this document. All identifying
information and digital images and recordings are destroyed immediately
after analysis unless participants have given explicit consent to use those
images or names for explicit media purposes as designated in the Release
Form. Only de-identified data will be shared with non-UCI collaborating
researchers.Certificate of Confidentiality

improved self-esteem and pro-social behavior and reduced symptoms of
inattention and oppositional behavior.
Specify the expected potential societal/scientific benefit(s) of this study:
The possible benefits to science and society include providing information
about how potential biological responses to animals may enhance treatments
for children with ADHD. This information is important as there are few
evidence-based non-pharmacological interventions for this group of
individuals who remain at risk for poor life outcomes despi[INVESTIGATOR_666028].

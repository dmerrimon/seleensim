Confidential  Page [ADDRESS_917110] (DMSB) will be responsible for periodic review of 
the safety data from  the NIH/NIDCD -funded study “ Non-invasive B rain Stimulation for 
Swallowing Recovery after a Dysphagic S troke ”.  The DSMB will periodically review data on 
safety.  The DSMB will convene according to a planned schedule (refer to Section 6 of this 
Charter) .  The DSMB will be responsible for:  
1) evaluating the incidence all adverse events,  particularly those reported with moderate or 
severe intensity  , and all serious adverse events , including death, 
2) recommending continuing the study or whether a modification or termination of the study 
is necessary to ensure the safety of all patients,   
3) monitoring the timeliness and quality of safety data collected during the course of this 
study. 
 
2. BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS  
Dysphagia occurs frequently a fter a stroke and often leads to serious  complications . Currently 
there are no effective therapi[INVESTIGATOR_677855]. The usual 
clinical practice is to supplement nutrition using nasogastric or percutaneous gastrostomy tu bes 
till swallowing improves spontaneously, if at all. These techniques however, do not prevent dysphagia complications like aspi[INVESTIGATOR_59499]; conversely, they may promote disuse of the swallowing mechanism, increase risk of gastrointestinal bleeding and worsen outcomes in some patients . Implementation of an intervention that improves swallowing in the early  aftermath of a 
stroke can therefore be expected to improve patient outcomes and decrease costs of care.  
 It has been shown that dysphagia recovery from a hemispheric stroke is associated with an 
expansion of the swallowing representation in the unaffected hemisphere . A treatment approach 
that facilitates this reorganization in  the unaffected hemisphere can help accelerate recovery. 
Anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)  is a non -invasive brain stimulation 
technique that can modulate neuronal excitability of the swallowing motor  cortex, and make it 
more amenable to plastic changes. While it is safe and effective in improving  functions in 
chronic stroke patients, data about its safety and efficacy in acute stroke phase remains sparse. In our pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] [ADDRESS_917111] -specific variables that influence spontaneous swallowing recovery and/or response to 
the proposed intervention merit examination as they can improve our  understanding about the 
variability of treatment response between subjects, and lead to more efficient study  designs by 
[CONTACT_677899]. We have  
recently identified a few subject -specific predictors of swallowing recovery from several 
candidate variables, as outlined in our Preliminary Data. In addition we will use novel neuroimaging measures to obtain surrogate estimates of injury to cortical pathways that regulate 
  The FEASt Trial  
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_677854], MD 
Procedures  Manual  
 
Confidential  Page [ADDRESS_917112] -related  predictors on the effects of our 
intervention.  
 
Our specific aims are:  
Primary Aim:  To determine safety and examine effects of 2 different doses of 
anodal tDCS versus sham s timulation of the swallowing motor cortex of the 
undamaged hemisphere, combined concomitantly with swallowing exercises, in 
patients with dysphagia due to an acute -subacute unilateral hemispheric 
infarction.  
 
Approach:  
A) We will collect data on the effect of our intervention by : 
 i) Analyzing changes in penetration and aspi[INVESTIGATOR_677856] 2 tDCS and sham groups using by a validated assessment tool, the Penetration and Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_127353] (PAS) scores;  
 ii) Examining effects of differing doses of anodal tDCS versus sham stimulation on several physiological measures of swallowing, derived from videofluoroscopic swallowing studies;  
 iii) Evaluating durability of any observed effects of tDCS on dietary status as determined by [CONTACT_677900] (FOIS) score at study onset and 1 month.  
 B) We will assess safety by [CONTACT_677901] 3 groups: seizures, stroke specific mortality, neurological and swallowing det erioration as measured by [CONTACT_677902] (NIHSS), and FOIS and PAS scores, respectively.  
 
 Secondary Aim:  To investigate the impact of subject -specific predictors of 
dysphagia recovery on the outcome of our proposed intervention.  
 
Approach: We will examine differences in the effect size of our intervention across 
different strata of subject specific- predictors extracted from our pi[INVESTIGATOR_677857] (CBT) -lesion load (as a surrogate measure of lesion size and 
location) by [CONTACT_746] a subgroup analysis using regression models.

3.1.1 
Participants  
99 stroke patients with dysphagia after an acute/subacute unilateral hemispheric infarction, 
presenting at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) will be prospectively enrolled, 
if eligible, into the study.  All stroke patients admitted to our hospi[INVESTIGATOR_677858] a standardized 
dysphagia screening using a bedside water swallow test and are referred for a swallow evaluation to a speech and language pathologist ( SLP) if suspected of having dysphagia. 
Those with moderate to severe dysphagia (PAS > 4) on a standardized videofluroscopic 
swallowing (VFSS) evaluation will be invited for participation if they fulfil l all study criteria. 
The patient as well as the SLP wi ll be blinded to the stimulation allocation. Subjects will be 
randomly assigned to the two intervention or sham groups using PROC PLAN in SAS using a blocking scheme with block size of 6. Subjects will be stratified based on their baseline PAS score (4 -6 vs. 7-8) before randomization to the three treatment groups. 
 
3.1.2 
Outcomes  
Primary Efficacy Outcome:  Penetration -Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_677859] [PAS]: This is a validated [ADDRESS_917113] adopted a cut off PAS score > [ADDRESS_917114] score (8) for that item.  
 Primary Safety Outcome:  The major safety outcome measures  will be seizures, 
neurological and motor deterioration or stroke specific mortality  during the period of 
active stimulation. In light of our small sample size and low expected number of adverse events, we will rely on data from historical cohorts to derive our cut- off numbers for study 
suspension.  
a. Seizures: We expect that a seizure provoked by [CONTACT_677903]. However, we will analyze the incidence of seizures during the 5 days of active stimulation since excitability changes from tDCS can be prolonged.   
b. Neurological and Motor Deterioration : We will only include neurological deterioration 
not due to a new stroke, hemorrhagic transformation, or a coexisting encephalopathy. Deterioration will be defined as an increase in the NIHSS by > 4 points between ea ch 
successive day during active or sham stimulation . NIHSS score will be computed at the 
bedside by [CONTACT_677904]. Similarly motor deterioration for an 
individual patient is defined as a ≥ 2 point worsening from baseline on the NIHSS motor sub-item score for a given limb.   
c. Swallowing Deterioration:  We will record a FOIS score on day 3 of our protocol to assess 
any deterioration of swallowing with the allocated intervention (tDCS or sham). To minimize 
  The FEASt Trial  
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_677854], MD

Confidential  Page [ADDRESS_917115] with 
> 3 point decrease in FOIS, will undergo an interim VFSS to obtain an interim PAS score. 
Swallowing deterioration will then be defined as an increase in the PAS score ≥ 2 points 
compared to baseline score based on this interim assessment not due to other confounding 
factors outlined above.  
d. Stroke specific mortality:  Deaths  due to direct consequences of brain injury such as brain 
edema or seizure will count for stroke specific mortality, but not deaths from recurrent ischemic events, hemorrhage, pneumonia, cardiac events, and infections. All deaths will be reported to DSMB who will determine if the death is a possible consequence of tDCS or not.  
e. Non serious events such as headaches, skin erythema, fatigue and visual perceptual 
changes will be tabulated to assess patient tolerability but will not be used as primary safety outcome measures due to their subjective nature. The seriousness of any unexpected adverse events such as a serious skin burn will be promptly reported to the DSMB
 
 
Secondary Outcomes:   We will use 3 outcomes that assess swallowing physiology, 1 
outcome that provides functional (dietary) measure of oral intake, and 3 major safety 
outcomes.    
1. Outcomes of Swallowing Physiology:  
a) Pharyngeal Constriction Ratio (PCR):  PCR is a measure of the pharyngeal area visible in 
the lateral radiograph view at the point when a bolus is held in the oral cavity divided by [CONTACT_677905].  
b) Hyoid, Laryngeal, and Pharyngeal excursion (HLPE):  we will measure the actual 
excursion of these structures and landmarks from their resting point to maximal excursion.  Hyoid, laryngeal and pharyngeal excursion are all important and semi-independent movements that close off the airway, shorten the pharynx, and open the upper esophageal sphincter, and thus are important variables to measure.  
c) Pharyngeal Delay Time (PDT):  will provide a temporal measure of the briskness of the 
swallow onset.  We define PDT as “the time in centise conds that the bolus is present in the 
hypopharynx before the swallow is triggered”. PDT will be measured from the time the bolus first passes the intersection of ramus of mandible and base of tongue, until the swallow begins - as seen by [CONTACT_677906].  
 
2. Dietary Outcome: Functional Oral Intake Scale [FOIS]:  An important consequence of 
dysphagia is a compromised and altered diet. FOIS is a functional outcome that provides a valid ated measure of diet level. It has been tested and validated in stroke population and 
demonstrated to be sensitive to changes in swallowing functions in acute stroke patient . FOIS 
is an ordinal scale ranging from 1 (wors t) to 7 (normal oral diet) . It is easy to use and does 
not require specific training .  It will be collected at four  time points: 1) prior to initiating 
tDCS/sham stimulation (same day); 2) after the fifth session of tDCS/sham; 3) after the last session  of tDCS/sham stimulation; and 4 ) by [CONTACT_1381] [ADDRESS_917116] Trial

Confidential  Page 9 All participants will undergo 3 bedside swallowing evaluation and 2 standardized 
videofluroscopic studies (VFSS) to further quantify dysphagia severity. The VFSS will be conducted by [CONTACT_677907]. The first VFSS evaluation will occur on the day of first tDCS/sham stimulation session and the second evaluation will occur on the last (5th) day of stimulation. Prior to initiation of this project, the participating SLPs at BIDMC will undergo intensive training sessions with [CONTACT_677932] ([LOCATION_011] University Medical Center) so that they can reliably detect deep penetration up to the vocal cords or aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516] (PAS score > 4) on VFSS; patients will be 
enrolled if their PAS score > [ADDRESS_917117]. Langmore’s team at their laboratory in [LOCATION_011] 
University Medical Center (BUMC). The de-identified and coded VFSS will be transferred electronically using a secure file transfer system on the same day to BUMC for detailed analysis and  scoring. The lab at [LOCATION_011] University will be alerted immediately and will 
analyze the studies promptly to assess whether the PAS scores meet criteria for study enrolment. The patient will be viewed in the lateral plane for most swallows, but one swallow will be viewed in the anterior-posterior plane for asymmetry. The order of 
presentation will not be randomized but given in an incremental way due to the uncertainty about patient’s swallowing status and for safety, as outlined below: 
In Lateral view:  One  5 ml Nectar Varibar Swallow , One 5ml Varibar pudding,  
3 Varibar Thin Swallows: 5 ml thin liquids x1, 10 ml thin x 1 , 30 ml thin  x1; 
10 ml & [ADDRESS_917118]. Langmore’s laboratory, without patient identifiers, so that they are analyzed in a blinded fashion. Her research staffs, who are trained in this area, will record the following measures: (1) PAS (2) PCR, (3) HLPE, and (4) PDT. Inter- rater reliability of study analyses will be 
conducted for 30% of the studies, selected randomly. In addition, bedside swallow evaluation will be done on day [ADDRESS_917119]. They will be blinded to their group allotment and will be unable to subjectively distingu ish between t DCS 
versus sham stimulation . At the beginning of the study, besides the aforementioned 
swallowing evaluations and neurological assessments, information about handedness, biographical data, prior treatments, time of stroke onset (or last known time when subject was normal in those la cking a definite time of onset) and results of neuroimaging studies will 
be collected. TDCS will be delivered through a battery -driven, constant current stimulator 
(NeuroConn-DC Stimulator Plus).  The area of electrode in contact [CONTACT_677908] 3 x 5 cm for the small electrode (anode) and 5 x 6 cm for the larger electrode (reference electrode).

Confidential  Page [ADDRESS_917120] at this site. For sham stimulation,  the current will be ramped up 
to 2 mA and gradually decreased over 30 seconds, to produce a sensation of transient tingling, which is indistinguishable from active stimulation . This device has a “study” mode 
which allows for double blinding of both the operator and subject. In addition, the SLP involved in bedside swallowing evaluations and VFSS, as well as the investigator performing NIHSS will also remain blinded to the study allocation.  
Electrode Placement:   Our aim is to stimulate the inferolateral regions of the primary 
sensorimotor and premotor cortex of the unaffected hemisphere . We will use the 
international 10- [ADDRESS_917121] the anode mid -distance between C3/T3 [left] or C4/T4 [right] over the unaffected 
hemisphere and the reference electrode over the contralateral supraorbital region.  
● Stimulation Parameters: We will use a current dose o f 2mA for anodal tDCS. All subjects 
will undergo daily session of stimulation (tDCS or sham) for  5 consecutive days .   
● tDCS Device Programming and Fidelity Check: Two  individuals (device programmer) not 
involved in patient recruitment, stimulation sessions or outcome analysis will be assigned to program the tDCS device. They will receive the randomization code from the DCC and set 
the device to active or sham accordingly.  For each  treatment they will enter the subject ID 
and setting on a case report form (‘Blinded Information’ form, for the Data Center only). The programmer will deliver the device to the treating clinician, who after each treatment will 
return the device to the programmer.  The programmer will verify that the device setting is 
correct and the device is working properly, and enter this information on the case report form.  
 
● Swallowing Exercises : Patients will be given a lemon flavored lollipop to stimulate saliva 
production during these sessions. Food boluses or liquids will not be used because of a risk 
of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_677860]. Each treatment session will consist of coaching the patient to perfor m an ‘effortful ’ swallow, alternating with a ‘regular’ 
swallows.   Prior to starting the sessions, the standardized “Effortful Swallow” maneuver will be taught and reviewed with patients by [CONTACT_127428] . Patients will be given simple verbal 
instructions such as: “When you swallow, press your tongue hard up to the roof of your mouth, then slide it back to the throat and squeeze your throat muscles and lift your larynx as high as possible.” In addition to the verbal instructions, we will use gesticulations to encourage aphasic patients to swal low at regular intervals. A laryngeal mic will be attached 
to the subject’ s neck prior to each  sessions and occurrence of a swallow response will 
assessed by [CONTACT_677909]’ excursion in patients with thicker necks.  A total of

and suction pumps so that in the remote event of an aspi[INVESTIGATOR_677861], the material can be suctioned out promptly and other remedial measures are taken. [CONTACT_600198] will train the

Neuroimaging Analysis  
Computation of CBT -lesion load:  We will perform functional imaging experiments in [ADDRESS_917124]  of 
repeat ed swallowing trials contrasted with whole hand opening and closing tasks, done at the 
same frequency as the swallowing tasks. Functional MR images will be  acquired with a 
gradient -echo T2*- weighted MR pulse sequence using our own modification of a sparse 
temporal sampling method with clustered volume acquisition to overcome imaging artifacts caused by [CONTACT_677911] . The voxel cluster s of significant activation will be  used as a 
seed region  (to identify the cortical origin of the CBT ).  The second seed region will be defined 
in the posterior pons. The CBT will be traced from the cortical seed region in the swallowing 
cortex to the posterior pons regions. Exclusion masks  will be draw in order to exclude fiber 
projections that are not part of the CBT  
Identifying and reconstructing the corticobulbar tract and determining the CBT -lesion load:  
We will construct the corticobulbar tract by [CONTACT_677912] 12 healthy control subjects. The DTI scans will be  high resolution studies 
obtained in normal controls, using a single -shot, spin- echo echoplanar imaging sequ ence with 
the following parameters: TR=10 seconds, TE=86.[ADDRESS_917125] Trial

Procedures  Manual  
 
Confidential  Page 12 noncollinear diffusion directions with a b value of 1000 s/mm2, and 6 acquisitions with a value 
of 0 s/mm2. Image acquisition, analysis, construction of cortic obulbar tracts and computation of 
CBT -lesion load will be  computed replicating me thods described by [CONTACT_677913]  (2010) . The 
diffusion -weighted images of all acute patients will be normalized to a skull -stripped (using 
FSL BET at 0.5) T1 -weighted SPM5 brain template with isotropic voxels  2×2×2mm. This 
normalization is being  chosen, since the T2 -weighted Diffusion trace images tend to omit the 
skull and the T1 and the Trace image of the DWI have dark signal representing the CSF 
compartment.    
Acquisition and An alysis of MRI Data:  The MRI scans of all patients enrolled in the trial arm 
will be used for CBT -lesion load and infarct volume measurements.  One experienced 
investigator who is  blinded  to subjects’ behavioral outcomes will manually dra w patient  lesion 
masks. The drawings will be made using MRIcro software (http://www.mccauslandcenter.sc.edu/mricro) on stroke patients’ normalized Diffusion-Weighted Imaging studies. For the lesion load calculation, ea ch stroke patient lesion map will 
be individual ly overlaid onto the canonical probabilistic CBT map to calculate the lesion load 
of each patient. Lesion overlap calculations for each patient were done as described by [CONTACT_677913]. (2010). In short, the maps will consist  of voxel intensities ranging from I  = 0 (voxel is not 
present in any part of the tract or functional gray matter map in any subjects) to I = 12 (the voxel is present in the part of the tract in all sub- jects). The probability of each voxel being a 
part of the tract is 1/12 of that voxel’s total intensity. Lesion load will be  calculated by 
[CONTACT_677914] .  
 3.1.6  
Sample Size and Statistical Analysis:  
Statistical Analyses: We will conduct two analyses: Intent to Treat (ITT) and Per-Protocol 
(PP) analyses.  The primary analysis will be the ITT analysis.  
Descriptive Analyses: For continuous variables, the mean, median, standard deviation, range, 
minimum, maximum, interquartile range, and sample size for each treatment group will be reported. For categorical variables the frequency distribution will be reported for each treatmen t group.                         
Baseline Comparability: While no substantial differences between treatment groups are 
anticipated given randomization, we will use summary statistics, graphical techniques such as boxplots, and univariate analyses to compar e the baseline characteristics of treatment 
groups.  Pre- treatment values will be compared between the placebo - and tDCS-groups using 
Analysis of CoVariance (ANCOVA) or the Mantel -Haenszel chi -squared test, as appropriate, 
to determine if the groups are ba lanced with respect to baseline characteristics while 
accounting for stratification by [CONTACT_677915]. This comparison will allow us to identify potential confounders to be included in multivariate analyses. 
Analytic plan Primary Aim . Primary analysis  will use an intent- to-treat approach; thus all 
randomized subjects will be used in the primary analysis. For the primary outcome variable (PAS) a linear model will be fitted to the data using PROC MIXED in SAS. The outcome will be a change in mean PAS score. Treatment will be included as a categorical variable. Additionally baseline PAS and other variables that will be identified as confounders will be included as covariates. Adjusted means in the two tDCS groups will be compared to those in 
  The FEASt Trial

Procedures  Manual  
 
Confidential  Page [ADDRESS_917126] to causality based on the investigator’s judgment. Interim Analyses  No 
formal efficacy analysis will be performed.  The study will not be stopped for early efficacy or futility.   
Analytic plan for Secondary Aim:  To assess the effect size across subject -specific predictors 
(baseline NIHSS score, dysarthria, CBT -lesion load and intubation), subgroup analyses will 
be conducted. For such analysis regression models will be employed that include intervention, covariate and covariate by [CONTACT_677916] p redictors and PAS scores, 
PCR, PDT, HLPE as outcomes, to examine the modifying effect of the covariates on the intervention.  If a significant interaction is detected, analyses of major efficacy endpoints (PAS scores, PCR, PDT, HLPE) will be performed within each group.                     
Missing Data:  Many longitudinal studies have the potential to suffer from problems with 
missing data. We anticipate a 35% - 40% attrition rate in this study, which includes drop-out, 
spontaneous recovery and discharge, based on review of our hospi[INVESTIGATOR_677862] [ADDRESS_917127] any other serious problems with either the extent or the pattern of missing data but we will explore this issue by [CONTACT_677917] .              
Sample Size and Power Calculations : We plan to enroll and randomize  99 subjects; 33 
subjects to each of the two active and sham treatment.  With the above sample size, after 40% attrition, we estimate that a difference o f 1.[ADDRESS_917128] deviations between the 
active and sham treatment in the mean primary outcome measure of the study can be detected with a type I error rate of 2.5% and power 80% and 90%, respectively . In our pi[INVESTIGATOR_677863] w as 1.[ADDRESS_917129] >87% power to detect the expected differences in our study. We also 
anticipate a greater effect size in the high dose group and thus the power to be greater.

unblinded as to study participants’ treatment assignments as required to fulfill DSMB 
obligations. 
5. CONFLICTS OF INTERES T 
DSMB Members  
DSMB membership will be restricted to individuals free of conflicts of interest.  A conflict of 
interest is defined as any incentive, financial or otherwise, that may cause a DSMB reviewer 
to lose his/her objectivity in the review and evaluation of safety or other data provided to the 
committee, and which therefore compromises the scientific integrity of the study or biases the conclusions reached by [CONTACT_942].  Conflicts may arise out of the financial or other 
interests of the DSMB member’s spouse/partner or dependent children as well. 
These conflicts may include, but are not limited to, the following:  
• Compensation to the DSMB members where the value of such compensation may be 
affected by [CONTACT_58435], or compensation beyond that which is reasonably or normally paid to clinical or statistical consultants; 
• A proprietary interest in the study product, including patent, trademark or copyright, 
as well as licensing arrangement s;

• Consulting arrangements with the Principal Investigator ; 
• Lecture fees or review stipends provided by [CONTACT_079]  [INVESTIGATOR_677865]; and  
• Reimbursement of travel expenses not related to his/her service on the DSMB. 
DSMB members are responsible for advising the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_604908]/NIDCD in 
writing of any potential conflicts of interest, as well as any changes in their financial 
interests, throughout the duration of the study and for one year thereafter.  The Principal 
Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_604908]/NIDCD shall be responsible for (i) deciding whether any financial 
interest of a DSMB member has the potential to create an actual or perceived conflict of 
interest and (ii) providing disclosure to all other DSMB members of any conflicts of interest 
that the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_604908]/NIDCD determine  do not impede 
objectivity.   Members of the DSMB who develop significant potential or perceived conflicts 
of interest will be asked to resign from the DSMB. 
Independent Data Coordinating Center and Independent Biostatistician 
Employees of, or contractors to, DCC , as well as the independent Biostatistician, shall be free 
of conflicts of interest as defined above.  These individuals will be responsible for advising 
the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_604908]/NIDC in writing of any potential conflicts of interest, as 
well as any changes in their financial interests, throughout the duration of the study and for one year thereafter.  The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_604908]/NIDCD  shall be responsible for (i) 
deciding whether any financial interest of any of the above named individuals has the potential to create an actual or perceived conflict of interest and (ii) providing disclosure to all DSMB members of any conflicts of interest that the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_677866]/NIDCD determine  do not impede objectivity. 
6. RESPONSIBILITIES  
Responsibilities of the DSMB  
It is the responsibility of the DSMB to provide an independent review and assessment of the accumulating safety data and to further safeguard the interests and safety of the participating 
subjects.  The primary role of the DSMB is to recommend study continuation or cessation 
after review of safety data including review of, but not limited to: adverse events ( AEs), 
serious adverse events ( SAEs ), neurological deterioration, and expected or unexpected 
patient death and cause of death.  
The DSMB will be responsible for ensuring the timely review of all safety data generated, and make recommendations to the NIH/NIDCD and Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_677867], termination, or modification of the trial.  The DSMB will review data rel ated to 
the conduct of the study (i.e., the quality of the study and its ultimate ability to address the scientific questions of interest).  The DSMB will advise the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_677866]/NIDCD  of their recommendation that the trial should continue unchanged, be modified, 
or be terminated due to safety concerns.  
6.1.1. Evaluation of Safety  
The DSMB will review demographic, baseline, treatment exposure, and safety data, 
including adverse events, serious adverse events, deteriorations and deaths, which wil l be 
  The FEASt Trial  
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_677854], MD 
Procedures  Manual  
 
Confidential  Page 16 summarized prior to each meeting.  Data to be reviewed will include tabulations of aggregate 
data (all data from all patients grouped), tabulations of unblinded comparative outcome data by [CONTACT_1570], and by- patient listings.  
In the role of safety adviso ry group for this study, the DSMB will:  
1) evaluate the incidence of deaths, all adverse events, particularly serious adverse events and those reported with moderate or severe intensity, and other relevant measures of patient safety, patient enr ollment and study completion status, 
2) determine whether a modification or termination of the study is necessary to ensure patient safety  or recommend continuing the study ,  
3) monitor the conduct of the study, e.g., rate of recruitment, ineligibility, non- compliance 
with the protocol, dropouts, and balance between treatments with respect to demographics, 
4) inspect descriptive statistics of average P AS at baseline and Day 5 and of the change 
from baseline to Day 5, 
5) inspec t descriptive statistics of secondary outco mes ( PCR, HLPE, PDT, FOIS, NIHSS) 
and change from baseline in secondary outcomes at each visit in which they are measured, 
6) consider whether the trial or dose should be temporarily or permanently stopped based on 
pre-defined stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_677868].  Specifically : 
a. pause/stop enrollment in a dose if 3/10 or 4/20 in that dose exhibit seizures;
 
b. pause/stop all  enrollment if at least 4/20 or 5/40 patients in both active doses 
combined experience seizure;  
c. the mortality stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_677869]; note 
that the probability for these rules is based on the following assumptions and on the binomial distribution:  
i. we assume the n atural history of the condition yields probability of 
seizure of 6% and probability of mortality  of 7%; 
ii. probability of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_663656], if these are the true probabilities , using the above stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004], is <5%; 
iii. thus if a stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_4081], odds are that true rates are higher than 6%/7%;  
d. a swallowing d eterioration for an individual patient is defined as follows:  A 
FOIS change from baseline of > 3 points will trigger a repeat, interim 
swallowing assessment; swallowing deterioration will then be defined as an increase in the PAS score > 2 points compared to baseline score based on this 
interim assessment. The stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_522892] a swallowing deterioration is: 
i. pause/stop enrollment in a dose if 5/10 or 8/20 in that dose exhibit 
swallowing deterioration ; 
ii. Pause/stop all  enrollment if at least 8/20 or 13/40 patients in both 
active doses combined swallowing deterioration; note that the probability for these rules is based on the following assumptions and on the binomial distribution:  
1. we assume the natural history of the condition yields probability of swallowing deterioration  of 20%;

f. A limb deterioration for an individual patient is defined as a > 2 point 
worsening from baseline on the NIHSS motor score for a given limb.  The same stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_677871].
 
 
These stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_677872] a guideline, not an absolute end-point, for the DSMB to 
consider stoppin g the trial.  
 
All reported AEs and AEs considered by [CONTACT_677918]- related 
(having a relationship of a t least possibly study intervention) will be tabulated for all patients 
who have received any amount of intervention.  Tabulations of serious adverse events  will be 
provided.  As part of the AE and serious AE tabulations, the incidence of neurological and swallowing deteriorations will be provided.  At regularly scheduled meetings the DSMB will 
be provided with a copy of all SAE Reports.  In addition, the DSMB will be notified of any reportable SAEs as soon as possible in between meetings.  Any additional information necessary to evaluate the continued safety of all patients enrolled in this trial will also be 
provided. 
Based on differential mortality rate and the type, severity, and relationship of the AEs to 
study drug, the DSMB may  recommend continuation, suspension, modification of 
procedures, and/or stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_21356].   
6.1.2. Evaluation of Efficacy  
The DSMB will inspect descriptive s tatistics (sample size, mean, median, standard deviation, 
minimum and maximum) of average PAS at baseline and Day 5 and of the change from 
baseline to Day 5 , and of secondary outcomes ( PCR, HLPE, PDT, FOIS, NIHSS ) and change 
from baseline in secondary outc omes at each visit in which they are measured.  These 
descriptive statistics will be presented by [CONTACT_677919]- to-Treat Analysis Set  
(there will be no imputation of missing data).  Pairwise comparisons of each active tD CS 
dose versus sham will be carried out at each visit on change from baseline using analysis of covariance adjusting for the baseline value.  There are no formal decision rules for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_677873].   
6.1.3. Responsibilities of the Independent Biostatistician  
The independent Biostatistician will have the following responsibilities:

and not mandate a fifth member. A potential replacement  will be sought, and approved by 
[CONTACT_4289]/NIDCD and the Principal Investigator .  It will be required that the replacement member 
will have the same functional expertise (i.e., either dysphagia, stroke or statistics) as the 
removed member.  The DSMB will be formally dissolved upon completion of the final clinical study report, although the final formal meeting of the DSMB will be dictated by [CONTACT_677922] (duration of study treatment).  The DSMB will not be responsible for reviewing the final planned analyses, follow-up amendment(s), or the final study report(s).  
7. MEETING SCHEDULE 
Organizational Meeting  
An organizational meeting will be held  to formally establish the DSMB and thoroughly 
acquaint the DSMB members with the study protocol and the data presentations that will be provided for the meetings.  This meeting gives the DSMB members the opportunity to provide input on the presentation specifications, the logistics of the interactions between the DSMB and the Principal Investigator/NIH/NIDCD , and on the operating guidelines 
presented in this charter.  Attendees will include all DSMB members, Medical Safety 
Officer, the Principal Investigator, Project Biostatistician  and NIH/NIDCD  representatives.  
Documents provided prior to the meeting will include the clinical study protocol, the DSMB Charter, including the closed session draft table and data listing shells.  The outcome of this meeting should be agreement on the table shells and operating guidelines, stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004], and a full understanding of the administrative procedures of the DSMB.   
In addition, DSMB members should leave with a full understanding of the protocol and its 
objectives, and reach a decision on the types and use of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004].   
Scheduled Meetings  
The DSMB will meet on a regular basis, with meetings scheduled at least once a year , but 
twice a year (or more) if requested by [CONTACT_4318] . The DSMB will meet to review data at the 
times specified in the table below.  However, the frequency of meetings may be modified 
because of a difference in the actual rate of patient enrollment or because of the severity and 
urgency of events related to the safety of study treatment.

The Principal Investigator, NIH/NIDCD, or DSMB can alter the above schedule, as 
necessary.  The DSMB may also convene for unscheduled me etings if there are immediate 
safety concerns identified during the course of the study. To call an unscheduled meeting, the DSMB chair will contact [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_604908]/NIDCD.  The Principal 
Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_604908]/NIDCD will not necessarily be told the reason for the unscheduled 
meeting.  Information to be communicated to the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_604908]/NIDCD regarding the meeting will be determined by [CONTACT_4318].  
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or NIH/NIDCD may request an unscheduled DSMB meet ing 
if a safety concern is identified for which DSMB review and/or recommendations may be requested.  To call an unscheduled meeting, the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_677881]/NIDCD will contact [CONTACT_2020] .  The DCC  will provide the DSMB with necessary data for review at 
the unscheduled meeting. 
8. MEETING FORMAT  
Attendance  
In order for a meeting to be held, [ADDRESS_917133] be in attendance; the DSMB 
biostatistician must always be present.  Meetings may be held face -to-face or via 
teleconference.  A decision regarding the trial can be made when at least 3 DSMB members (including the Chair and statistician) are participating and able to vote.  The DSMB may elect to obtain consensus from all members by [CONTACT_677923].  
Open Session: General Update 
At each DSMB meeting, an open session will be held with attendees including the DSMB members, representatives from NIH/NIDCD , Medical Safety Officer, the Principal 
Investigator, the independent Biostatistician, and the Project Biostatisticia n.  This session 
will focus on trial conduct issues including accrual and dropout rates, t imeliness of data entry 
(obtained from the electronic data capture system), eligibility rates, and reasons for ineligibility.  In addition, any changes to the study procedures or amendments to the protocols will be discussed and documented.  A ny data presented during the open session 
will be in aggregate form, with no reference to subject- level treatment assignments.  The 
information covered in the open session will be recorded in the open session minutes. 
Closed Session  
During the closed session, DSMB members will be present.  The NIH/NIDCD representative 
also will attend closed session unless the DSMB requests Executive Session. The independent Biostatistician may be presen t if so requested by [CONTACT_4318]. During this session, 
partially unblinded comparative outcome data will be reviewed by [CONTACT_677924] (see “Data Provided to the DSMB” in document). The information covered in the closed session will be contained in the closed session minutes which will not be made available to the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_677882] .

due to data corrections, those changes will be highlighted in future tabulations and data 
listings.   
The DCC  will produce all of the tabulations and data listings.  The independent 
Biostatistician will provide the tabulations and data listings to the DSMB members.  Closed 
session tabulations and data listings will be provided with treatment group identified  as 
“Treatment 1”, “Treatment 2” and “Treatment 3” without revealing the actual treatments that 
correspond to these codes.  When the analyses calls for statistical comparisons (e.g., see Section 6.1.2 above ) between treatments, pairwise p -values (Treatment 1 vs. 2; Treatment 1 
vs. 3; and Treatment 2 vs. 3) will be provided and will only be labeled as “Treatment 1 vs. 
2”, “Treatment 1 vs. 3”, and “Treatment 2 vs. 3”.  The independent statistician will have access to the actual treatments corresponding to “Treatment 1”, “Treatment 2” and “Treatment 3” in case the DSMB requests to be unblinded during the closed portion of the 
DSMB meeting.    Only the DSMB and  the independent Biostatistician will have access to 
these partially unblinded outputs.  The Principal Investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_677883] a 
blinded (open session) version of the output, where data listings do not contain treatment group and tabulations are provided in aggregate form (with all data from both treatment 
groups combined).   
Additional Data Requests from DSMB  
At any time during the study, the DSMB Chairperson, with agreement of at least one of the 
other members, may request additional data from the independent Biostatistician.  The additional data request will be forwarded to the NIH/NIDCD and Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_677884].  
If, based on the additional data, the DSMB feels that there is a need for an unscheduled formal analysis and meeting, the DSMB Chairperson will notify the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_604908]/NIDCD in writing.

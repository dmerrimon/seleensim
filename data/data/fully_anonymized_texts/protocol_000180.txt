2. TRIAL DESIGN/SCHEMA
1. Trial Overview
Following evaluation by [CONTACT_276266], patients with measurable 
myeloma disease will be enrolled.  Baseline assessment prior to enrollment may include bone marrow 
biopsy, peripheral blood collection, and staging of the patient per standard of care.  Baseline serum and 
urine paraprotein analysis, bone marrow biopsy, PET/CT imaging, skeletal survey, routine blood work, 
and baseline physical exam prior to enrollment.  Patient will be screened for tolerability to 
Pembrolizumab, and those that are also eligible for radiotherapy will be identified.  
Patients will receive on day 1, cycle 1, radiotherapy (8 Gy/1fx) to an extra-osseous site and/or any 
osseous bony site, followed by [CONTACT_79911] (200 mg/kg i.v. on day 2 or 3).  Baseline peripheral 
blood will be collected for myeloma response as well as for correlative biomarker analysis (timing of 
blood draws are defined in the flow chart in section 10.0).  
Patients will be assessed for safety during routine visits, as well as treatment response using the standard 
International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) Response Criteria (see Appendix II for IMWG 
Criteria) at 1 month  (shortly after completion of cycle 2 of pembrolizumab, anytime between Day 23-
30 +/- 7 days), and at least every 3 months +/-14 days (or as clinically indicated ).  Patients with 
stable disease or better per IMWG response criteria will continue with maintenance pembrolizumab 
(200 mg/kg every 3 weeks for 2 yrs).  Patients that have progressive disease, or relapse after a complete 
response will be removed from the trial and will be treated per standard of care at the discretion of the 
treating physician.  
Patients will continue to be monitored per standard of care on the trial.  Patients will be monitored for 
known radiation related toxicity, known pembrolizumab toxicity, as well as any unexpected toxicity, 
per standard of care. PET/CT scans will be done at baseline and every [ADDRESS_337169] of 
care.  
The primary endpoint is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of concurrent single/low dose 
radiotherapy (8 Gy/1fx) in combination with pembrolizumab in relapsed and/or refractory myeloma 
patients at 3 months (acute toxicity, primary endpoint) and at 6 and 12 months (late toxicity). The 
secondary objective is to characterize the effect of radiation in combination with pembrolizumab on 
systemic response rates using international myeloma working group (IMWG) uniform response criteria 
for myeloma, to assess baseline changes in PET/CT as a result of combining pembrolizumab and 
radiotherapy, and to evaluate treatment response at irradiated and un-irradiated sites (i.e. the abscopal 
effect) using baseline PET/CT. Exploratory analysis would include analyzing Circulating Myeloma 
Tumor cells and phenotype of T cells as a prognostic and predictive biomarker. Compare blood 
Myeloma tumor cells with BM tumor cells. We are interested in comparing T cell phenotype after each 
treatment and using that as a prognostic biomarker.  We will also evaluate serum LDH, CRP, ESR, 
ALC, cytokines and chemokines (such as IL-6, s IL-6R) and other immune related biomarkers, and 
correlate their expression pre and post treatment and evaluate changes in bone marrow biopsy and 
peripheral blood for mutational load, mutational signature (whole exome sequencing), transcriptome of 
the T cells, mutation specific T cells, PD1 and PDL1 expression on MM cells and T cells by [CONTACT_1603]/IHC, 
RNA-seq. Other biomarker correlative exploratory analysis (role of exosomes, etc) may also be pursued 
as ancillary research to this trial;

2. Acute Toxicity and Late Toxicity Assessment:
Acute toxicity (i.e, > Grade 2 CTCAE toxicity at 3 months) associated with radiation therapy 
at the radiated site will be analyzed as the primary safety endpoint in this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]; Goal 
would be to see less than 20% > grade 2 toxicity at 3 months within the radiated area. 
CTCAE criteria (see Appendix I) will be applied to assess acute toxicity. 
Other endpoints that may be analyzed include late toxicity (> Grade 2 CTCAE toxicity at the 
radiated site at 6 months and 12 months), systemic response against myeloma burden to 
localized radiation and pembrolizumab using IMWG uniform criteria, as well as other 
endpoints (defined in more detail in section 3.0).

1. Primary Objective, Endpoint, & Hypothesis
Primary Objective  
To evaluate the safety of concurrent single/low dose radiotherapy (8 
Gy/1fx) in combination with Pembrolizumab in relapsed or refractory 
myeloma patients; Once 10 patients are enrolled, we will stop trial 
for 3 months to assess for acute toxicity, and then resume the trial.

months  (the Dose Limiting Toxicity); 
 
       Primary Hypothesis  
The primary hypothesis of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_276255].
Alternative Hypothesis
It is possible that concurrent use of radiotherapy and Pembrolizumab in 
relapsed/refractory myeloma may increase CTCAE > grade 2 toxicity 
within the radiated site at 3 months.
2. Secondary Objective(s), Endpoint(s) & Hypothesis (es)
                                    Secondary Objectives 
To characterize late toxicity (CTCAE > grade 2 toxicity at 6 and 12 
months ) and the effect of radiation in combination with Pembrolizumab

Secondary Endpoints
a. 1. Number of patients achieving any response (from 
baseline) per IMWG response criteria at 6 months and 12 
months;
b. 2. Overall survival time at 6 months and 12 months;
c. 3. Overall response based on baseline changes on PET/CT 
at 6 months and 12 months; 
d. 4. Difference in pre and post treatment serum immune 
biomarkers;
Secondary Endpoint Definitions
a. Response is defined per IMWG criteria, and will be calculated at 6 
months and 12 months; 
b. Overall survival will be defined as time from first treatment on 
cycle 1, day 1 to the earlier of date of death and/or last follow up at 
6 months and 12 months.
c. Overall response will be defined using IMWG uniform response 
criteria. 
d.Several serum biomarkers will be analyzed.

4. BACKGROUND & RATIONALE

improved with the introduction of new agents, patients continue to relapse after effective therapy, and 
ultimately develop refractory disease.   Treatment of relapsed myeloma include bortezomib, 
lenalidomide, dexamethasone, carfilzomib, pomalidomide, panobinostat, monoclonal antibodies and/or 
some combination of these. The role of pembrolizumab within myeloma, an anti PD-1 immune 
checkpoint inhibitor, is currently under investigation. The role of radiotherapy for relapsed myeloma is 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_276256]/or for prevention of significant neurological effects or 
end organ damage due to progression of extra-osseous manifestation of relapsed myeloma.  However, 
whether radiation therapy may enhance PD-[ADDRESS_337185] demonstrated that radiation therapy can augment the immune response via the 
radiation induced “abscopal effect”. We utilized a human equivalent syngeneic mouse model 
implanted with B16 melanoma cells on both flanks of a mouse; using a 10 Gy single dose of radiation, 
we observed significant delay of the radiated site, as well as the remote non-radiated tumor site (Fig. 
1A). This action at a distance implies that immune mechanisms are responsible. To validate this, we 
quantified the different immune cells that are responsible for the “abscopal effect” (Fig. 1B,1C & 1D). 
For many years, mouse xenograft models have dominated in cancer drug development fields. Due to 
its immunedeficiency, these models are not suitable to address immune response in cancer treatment. 
Our novel syngeneic mouse models provide us reliable platform for immunotherapy studies.   Our 
results are provocative given that post-irradiation increases PD-1 expression on T cells, and combining 
radiation with anti-PD1 antibody therapy demonstrates synergy1.

flank, and tumors measured every other day. The mice were sacrificed at day 17. B. Tumor growth kinetics in mice 
with Irradiated tumor (blue) or un-Irradiated tumor (Red), demonstrating a decreased tumor volume with Irradiation 
in primary as well as secondary tumor C. Expansion of CD8 and CD4 T cells was found in irradiated side of tumor 
(left column) after radiation therapy, suggesting that radiation influences immune cell phenotypes within tumor 
microenvironment. D. Radiated decreased myeloid suppressor cells. All the Ly6G+ cells were Ly6C+ characteristic 
MDSCs.
Several reports have suggested that radiotherapy in combination with emerging immunotherapy agents 
such as PD-1, PD-L11, CTLA-4 inhibitors2 as well as other immunotherapy agents (FLT-3 ligand3, 4-
1 BB 4,5etc) may increase the efficacy of these agents. Sharabi et al.6 and Dovedi et al.7 together 
demonstrate that radiation therapy increases the T cell repertoire and antigen presentation to T cells; 
furthermore, adding radiation to PD-1 blockade in mice models demonstrate significant improvement 
in systemic response and local control.8 Trials using some of these agents (PD-1 and others, in 
combination with radiotherapy) are ongoing, while others are in the planning stages for a wide variety 
of malignancies. 
Clinically, the combination of the PD-1 inhibitor, pembrolizumab in combination with revlamid (Rd) 
produced responses in 76% of the 17 heavily pretreated patients with relapsed or refractory multiple 
myeloma in the KEYNOTE-023 study (San Miguel J, Mateos MV, Shah JJ, et al. 57th American 
Society of Hematology Annual Meeting; Orlando, [LOCATION_012]; December 5-8, 2015. Abstract 505). Similar 
impressive results were seen with pembrolizumab in combination with pomalidomide and 
dexamethasone. Overall response rates of 60% among double refractory patients were seen with this 
safe combination. 
While future therapi[INVESTIGATOR_276257]-1 inhibitors as part of their medical 
oncology designs, it is also possible that some of these patients may also receive local radiotherapy (for 
palliation and/or prophylaxis) as part of their standard of care treatments. Thus, we propose to evaluate 
the safety and efficacy of pembrolizumab in combination with radiotherapy.  Our pi[INVESTIGATOR_276258]. Thus, we propose to evaluate the safety and 
outcomes of this combination in a small cohort of patients.
4.1 The Immune System in Cancer
In 2000, Hanahan and Weinberg published their seminal review describing the 6 
biological hallmarks acquired during the development from benign to malignant to metastatic 
tumors9. Eleven years later, they illustrated 2 further important processes that were since 
realized, including “evading the immune system”10.
The immune system consists of two main components, innate and adaptive system. In 
brief, the innate system is a non-specific response to differences between innate and foreign 
pathogens, while the adaptive system is a more tailored response that induces memory. As part 
of this adaptive response, macrophages and dendritic cells present foreign antigens to the T 
cell’s receptors. Further T cell activation is regulated by [CONTACT_200801], including both 
positive (co-stimulatory) and negative (co-inhibitory) surface receptors. Tumors can subvert 
the related immune recognition in part through increase of co-inhibitory molecule expression; 
two of these regulatory molecules are cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) and 
Product:  Pembrolizumab (MK-3475, IND 130757) 14
Protocol/Amendment No.:  Rad4106-17(MK-3475-749), v6/30/2022
programmed death 1 (PD-1) receptor.
4.2 Anti-PD-1 in Pre-Clinical Models
Programmed death 1 (PD-1) (or CD279) is part of the CD28 family of proteins, which 
includes CTLA-4 and ICOS, that regulate T cell activity21. PD-1 is a glycoprotein receptor that 
can be expressed on the surface of T cells, B cells and myeloid cells (monocytes and dendritic 
cells)21.  In T cells, PD-1 expression is primarily induced by T cell receptor (TCR) engagement 
and ligation with PD-L1 and PD-L2, expressed on antigen presenting cells, and induces an 
inhibitory signal that antagonizes TCR signaling and other important pathways necessary for 
optimal T cell activation 
Interestingly, melanoma, and to a lesser effect NSCLC, expresses abundant PD-1 
ligand (PD-L1), whereas T cells of advanced cancer patients notoriously express increased 
levels of PD-1. The combined effect is that these cancer cells are spared from T-cell-mediated 
cytotoxicity, and tumor infiltrating lymphocytes are maintained in a dysfunctional state, 
described as T cell exhaustion. Indeed, PD-[ADDRESS_337188] in pre-clinical models has demonstrated promising 
activity. Utilizing murine cancer cells, anti-PD1 antibody decreased tumor growth and 
decreased metastatic potential. Uisng B16 cells ( a PD-L1 positive cell line) and 4T1 cell line 
( a PD-L1 negative cell line),  the author demonstrated similar efficacy of PD-[ADDRESS_337189] since demonstrated 
the efficacy of anti-PD-1 antibodies in both PD-L1 positive and negative tumors. We 
hypothesize that combining radiotherapy (Fig. 1) in combination with PD-1 blockade may 
enhance PD-1 responses in patients. 
4.3 Rationale for Pembrolizumab Dose Selection/Regimen/Modification 
An open-label Phase I trial (Protocol 001) is being conducted to evaluate the safety 
and clinical activity of single agent MK-3475 (pembrolizumab).  The dose escalation portion 
of this trial evaluated three dose levels, 1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, and 10 mg/kg, administered every 
2 weeks (Q2W) in subjects with advanced solid tumors.  All three dose levels were well 
tolerated and no dose-limiting toxicities were observed.  This first in human study of MK-
3475 showed evidence of target engagement and objective evidence of tumor size reduction 
at all dose levels (1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg Q2W).  No MTD has been identified to 
date.  10.0 mg/kg Q2W, the highest dose tested in PN001, will be the dose and schedule 
utilized in Cohorts A, B, C and D of this protocol to test for initial tumor activity.  Recent 
data from other clinical studies within the MK-3475 program has shown that a lower dose of 
MK-3475 and a less frequent schedule may be sufficient for target engagement and clinical 
activity.
PK data analysis of MK-3475 administered Q2W and Q3W showed slow systemic 
clearance, limited volume of distribution, and a long half-life (refer to IB). Pharmacodynamic 
data (IL-2 release assay) suggested that peripheral target engagement is durable (>21 days).

a wide therapeutic range based on the melanoma indication.  The differences in exposure for 
a 200 mg fixed dose regimen relative to a 200 mg Q3W body weight based regimen are 
anticipated to remain well within the established exposure margins of 0.5 – 5.0 for MK-3475 
in the melanoma indication. The exposure margins are based on the notion of similar efficacy 
and safety in melanoma at 10 mg/kg Q3W vs. the proposed dose regimen of 200 mg200 mg 
Q3W (i.e. 5-fold higher dose and exposure). The population PK evaluation revealed that 
there was no significant impact of tumor burden on exposure. In addition, exposure was 
similar between the NSCLC and melanoma indications. Therefore, there are no anticipated 
changes in exposure between different indication settings.
The rationale for further exploration of 200 mg and comparable doses of 
pembrolizumab in solid tumors is based on: 1) similar efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab 
when dosed at either 200 mg or 10 mg/kg Q3W in melanoma patients, 2) the flat exposure-
response relationships of pembrolizumab for both efficacy and safety in the dose ranges of 200 
mg Q3W to 10 mg/kg Q3W, 3) the lack of effect of tumor burden or indication on distribution 
behavior of pembrolizumab (as assessed by [CONTACT_78013]) and 4) the assumption 
that the dynamics of pembrolizumab target engagement will not vary meaningfully with tumor 
type.
The choice of the 200 mg Q3W as an appropriate dose for the switch to fixed dosing is 
based on simulations performed using the population PK model of pembrolizumab showing 
that the fixed dose of 200 mg every 3 weeks will provide exposures that 1) are optimally 
consistent with those obtained with the 2 mg/kg dose every 3 weeks, 2) will maintain individual 
patient exposures in the exposure range established in melanoma as associated with maximal 
efficacy response and 3) will maintain individual patients exposure in the exposure range 
established in melanoma that are well tolerated and safe. 
A fixed dose regimen will simplify the dosing regimen to be more convenient for physicians 
and to reduce potential for dosing errors.  A fixed dosing scheme will also reduce complexity 
in the logistical chain at treatment facilities and reduce wastage.
4.[ADDRESS_337191] trial administered pembrolizumab at 3 different doses 
(2mg/kg q3weeks, 10mg/kg q3weeks, and 10mg/kg q2weeks) for 4 total cycles, followed by 
[CONTACT_276269]. Overall, 79% of patients develop any grade 
of toxicity. The most common toxicities were fatigue (30%), rash (21%), pruritus (21%), and 
diarrhea (20%). However, most of these symptoms were low grade, as only 13% developed 
grade 3- 4 toxicities. Furthermore, grade 3-4 adverse events were dose related: the 10mg/kg,

Protocol/Amendment No.:  Rad4106-17(MK-3475-749), v6/30/2022
q2week cohort was 23%, while the q3week cohorts was 4-9%. The grade 3 clinical toxicities 
documented included rash (2%), pruritus (1%), hypothyroidism (1%), diarrhea (1%), 
abdominal pain (1%), decreased appetite (1%), elevated AST (1%), and renal failure (1%). In 
the 2 cases of renal failure, both cases improved with discontinuation of pembrolizumab and 
initiation of glucocorticoid therapy
In the trial of pembrolizumab in advanced melanoma patients, the toxicity profile was 
similar to that reported by [CONTACT_276270]: 82% developed any grade of toxicity, while 12% 
developed grade 3-[ADDRESS_337192] common toxicities were fatigue, pruritus, and rash. 
Reported grade 3-4 toxicities included fatigue (3%), elevated amylase (<1%), anemia (<1%), 
autoimmune hepatitis (<1%), confusion (<1%), diarrhea (<1%), dyspnea (<1%), 
encephalopathy (<1%), hypophysitis (<1%), hypoxia (<1%), muscular weakness (<1%), 
musculoskeletal pain (<1%), pancreatitis (<1%), peripheral motor neuropathy (<1%), 
pneumonitis (<1%), rash (<1%), rash maculopapular (<1%). Overall 6 patients (7%) developed 
adverse events leading to discontinuation of the drug. 3 of these cases (3%) were immune 
mediated. No drug related grade [ADDRESS_337193] been 
discovered include vasculitis and hypothyroiditis (refer to latest investigator brochure 
accompanying the trial). 
In the phase [ADDRESS_337194] common grade > 3 adverse events were fatigue (0.8%), decreased appetite 
(1.0%), nausea (0.8%), asthenia (1.0%), dyspnea (3.8%) and pneumonitis (1.8%). 1 patient 
who developed pneumonitis did die; overall, these findings demonstrate pembrolizumab is 
well tolerated and has similar toxicity profiles among the two histologies. 
Keynote 023 (San Miguel et al. Blood 2015, 126:505), conducted an open phase 1, 
multi-center, non-randomized, dose escalation trial to evaluate the safety, toxicity, and 
tolerability of pembrolizumab in combination with lenalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone 
in patients with relapsed/refractory myeloma. A 2 mg/kg q [ADDRESS_337195] frequent AEs were: thrombocytopenia (47%), neutropenia 
(41%), fatigue (29%), anemia, hyperglycemia, and muscle spasms (23%). No dose limiting 
toxicity were noted in the 10 mg-lenalidomide cohort; The MTD/MAD was defined as 200 mg 
fixed dose;  The objective response was 13/17 patients (76%) with 4 patients achieving a very 
good partial response and 9 patients achieving a partial response;  The authors concluded that 
PD-1 blockade showed promising anti-myeloma activity in heavily pre-treated 
relapsed/refractory myeloma patients.

5. ADMINSTRATION OF STUDY PHARMACEUTICAL 
In 2015, FDA approved Pembrolizumab (Keytruda) for the treatment of advanced melanoma 
and NSCLC patients; Pembrolizumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets the PD-1 receptor. 
Programmed death 1 (PD-1) (or CD279) is part of the CD28 family of proteins, which includes 
CTLA-4 and ICOS, that regulate T cell activity. PD-1 is a glycoprotein receptor that can be 
expressed on the surface of T cells, B cells and myeloid cells (monocytes and dendritic cells).  
In T cells, PD-1 expression is primarily induced by T cell receptor (TCR) engagement and 
ligation with PD-L1 and PD-L2, expressed on antigen presenting cells, and induces an 
inhibitory signal that antagonizes TCR signaling and other important pathways necessary for 
optimal T cell activation.  Clinical trials with Pembrolizumab in advanced melanoma and 
NSCLC patients lead to approval by [CONTACT_1622]. Some efficacy in combination with lenalidomide 
for multiple myeloma has also been recently demonstrated. The recommended dose of 
Keytruda is 2mg/kg administered as IV infusion over 30 minutes every 3 weeks until disease 
progression, or unacceptable toxicity. Alternative dosing regimens are also available.  The dose 
used on the Keynote -023 trial was 200 mg.
Dose Selection
Patients will receive pembrolizumab 200 mg IV delivered over a 30-minute period every 3 
weeks until 2 years, or until disease progression, and/or unacceptable toxicity at the discretion 
of the treating physician. Infusions should be given over 30 minutes (not bolus or IV push).
Timing of Pembrolizumab Administration
Trial treatment should be administered on Day 2 or 3 and then every 3 weeks +/- 7 days after 
that as outlined in the Trial Flow Chart; 
All trial treatments will be administered on an outpatient basis.
Pembrolizumab 200 mg will be administered as a 30 minute IV infusion every 3 weeks.  Sites 
should make every effort to target infusion timing to be as close to 30 minutes as possible.  
However, given the variability of infusion pumps from site to site, a window of -5 minutes and 
+10 minutes is permitted (i.e., infusion time is 30 minutes: -5 min/+10 min).
The Pharmacy Manual contains specific instructions for the preparation of the pembrolizumab 
infusion fluid and administration of infusion solution.

6. DOSE MODIFICATION, DOSE LIMITING TOXICITIES, AND 
SUPPORTIVE CARE
Dose modification and toxicity management for immune-related AEs associated with 
pembrolizumab
AEs associated with pembrolizumab exposure may represent an immunologic etiology. 
These immune-related AEs (irAEs) may occur shortly after the first dose or several months 
after the last dose of pembrolizumab treatment and may affect more than on body system 
simultaneously. Therefore, early recognition and initiation of treatment is critical to reduce 
complications.  Based on existing clinical trial data, most irAEs were reversible and could be 
managed with interruptions of pembrolizumab, administration of corticosteroids and/or other 
supportive care. For suspected irAEs, ensure adequate evaluation to confirm etiology or 
exclude other causes. Additional procedures or tests such as bronchoscopy, endoscopy, skin 
biopsy may be included as part of the evaluation. Based on the severity of irAEs, withhold or 
permanently discontinue pembrolizumab and administer corticosteroids. Dose modification 
and toxicity management guidelines for irAEs associated with pembrolizumab are provided 
in Table 2.
Dose modification and toxicity management of infusion-reactions related to 
pembrolizumab
Pembrolizumab may cause severe or life threatening infusion-reactions including severe 
hypersensitivity or anaphylaxis. Signs and symptoms usually develop during or shortly after 
drug infusion and generally resolve completely within 24 hours of completion of infusion. 
Dose modification and toxicity management guidelines on pembrolizumab associated 
infusion reaction are provided in Table 3.
Other allowed dose interruption for pembrolizumab 
Pembrolizumab maybe interrupted for situations other than treatment-related AEs such as 
medical / surgical events or logistical reasons not related to study therapy. Subjects should be 
placed back on study therapy within 3 weeks of the scheduled interruption, unless otherwise 
discussed with the Sponsor. The reason for interruption should be documented in the patient's 
study record.

7. DIET/ACTIVITY/OTHER CONSIDERATIONS
Diet
Subjects should maintain a normal diet unless modifications are required to manage an AE 
such as diarrhea, nausea or vomiting.
Contraception
Pembrolizumab may have adverse effects on a fetus in utero.  Furthermore, it is not known if 
pembrolizumab has transient adverse effects on the composition of sperm.  For this trial, male 
subjects will be considered to be of non-reproductive potential if they have azoospermia 
(whether due to having had a vasectomy or due to an underlying medical condition).  
Female subjects will be considered of non-reproductive potential if they are either: 
(1) Postmenopausal (defined as at least 12 months with no menses without an alternative 
medical cause; in women < 45 years of age a high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level 
in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a post-menopausal state in women 
not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy. In the absence of 12 
months of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insufficient.); 
OR 
(2) Have had a hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy, bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_176715]/occlusion, at least 6 weeks prior to screening; 
OR 
(3) Has a congenital or acquired condition that prevents childbearing.
Female and male subjects of reproductive potential must agree to avoid becoming pregnant or 
impregnating a partner, respectively, while receiving study drug and for [ADDRESS_337202] 
dose of study drug by [CONTACT_139649]:  
(1) Practice abstinence† from heterosexual activity; 
OR 
(2) Use (or have their partner use) acceptable contraception during heterosexual activity.  
Acceptable methods of contraception are‡: 
Single method (one of the following is acceptable):
• Intrauterine device (IUD)
Product:  Pembrolizumab (MK-3475, IND 130757) 28
Protocol/Amendment No.:  Rad4106-17(MK-3475-749), v6/30/2022
• Vasectomy of a female subject’s male partner 
• Contraceptive rod implanted into the skin
Combination method (requires use of two of the following):
• Diaphragm with spermicide (cannot be used in conjunction with cervical 
cap/spermicide)
• Cervical cap with spermicide (nulliparous women only)  
• Contraceptive sponge (nulliparous women only) 
• Male condom or female condom (cannot be used together)
• Hormonal contraceptive: oral contraceptive pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382] (estrogen/progestin pi[INVESTIGATOR_64870]-
only pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382]), contraceptive skin patch, vaginal contraceptive ring, or subcutaneous 
contraceptive injection
 
†Abstinence (relative to heterosexual activity) can be used as the sole method of 
contraception if it is consistently employed as the subject’s preferred and usual 
lifestyle and if considered acceptable by [CONTACT_176742]/IRBs.  
Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, sympto-thermal, post-ovulation 
methods, etc.) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.  
‡If a contraceptive method listed above is restricted by [CONTACT_427]/guidelines, 
then it does not qualify as an acceptable method of contraception for subjects 
participating at sites in this country/region.
Subjects should be informed that taking the study medication may involve unknown risks to 
the fetus (unborn baby) if pregnancy were to occur during the study.  In order to participate in 
the study subjects of childbearing potential must adhere to the contraception requirement 
(described above) from the day of study medication initiation (or 14 days prior to the initiation 
of study medication for oral contraception) throughout the study period up to [ADDRESS_337203]’s status until the pregnancy has been completed or 
terminated.  The outcome of the pregnancy will be reported to the Sponsor and to [COMPANY_006] 
without delay and within [ADDRESS_337204]:  Pembrolizumab (MK-3475, IND 130757) 29
Protocol/Amendment No.:  Rad4106-17(MK-3475-749), v6/30/2022
outcome is a serious adverse experience (e.g., death, abortion, congenital anomaly, or other 
disabling or life-threatening complication to the mother or newborn).  
The study investigator will make every effort to obtain permission to follow the outcome of 
the pregnancy and report the condition of the fetus or newborn to the Sponsor.   If a male 
subject impregnates his female partner the study personnel at the site must be informed 
immediately and the pregnancy reported to the Sponsor and to [COMPANY_006].
Use in Nursing Women
It is unknown whether pembrolizumab is excreted in human milk.  Since many drugs are 
excreted in human milk, and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in the 
nursing infant, subjects who are breast-feeding are not eligible for enrollment.
Subject Withdrawal/Discontinuation Criteria
Subjects may withdraw consent at any time for any reason or be dropped from the trial at the 
discretion of the investigator should any untoward effect occur.  In addition, a subject may be 
withdrawn by [CONTACT_456]-investigator if enrollment into the trial is inappropriate, the trial plan 
is violated, or for administrative and/or other safety reasons.
A subject must be discontinued from the trial for any of the following reasons:
8. The subject or legal or legal representative (such as a parent or legal guardian) 
withdraws consent.
9. Confirmed extra- extra-cranial radiographic disease progression.
10. Unacceptable adverse experiences as described in section 6 and 7.
11. Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment.
12. Investigator’s decision to withdraw the subject.
13. The subject has a confirmed positive serum pregnancy test.
14. Noncompliance with trial treatment or procedure requirements.
15. The subject is lost to follow-up.
16. Completed at least [ADDRESS_337205];
Note: [ADDRESS_337206] dose. Subjects 
who stop pembrolizumab after 24 months may be eligible for up to one year of 
additional study treatment at the discretion of their treating physician, especially if 
their disease is clinically stable;

8. DELIVERY OF RADIATION THERAPY TREATMENT
Patients will receive on day 1, radiotherapy (8 Gy/1fx) to an extra-osseous site and/or any bony site 
containing myeloma deposit, followed by [CONTACT_79911] (200 mg/kg i.v. on day 3).
Radiation Simulation and Diagnostic Procedures
All simulation and treatment procedures represent current institutional practice , and will be 
the same for all study participants.  
A radiation patient should have some evidence of disease on imaging prior to CT simulation.  
This can include a lytic lesion in a bony site or an extra-osseous disease.  Lytic lesions and/or 
extra-osseous noted on X-Ray, CT scan, PET/CT, and/or MRI are allowed. 
CT Simulation: A CT simulation using appropriate immobilization will be performed for 
radiation therapy treatment planning purposes several days to the initiation of radiation 
therapy. This procedure consists of a CT scan performed in the treatment position. It is not for 
diagnostic purposes and is not itself therapeutic, but the CT image is required for radiation 
planning and delivery. 
Radiation Dose and Tumor Volume Definition
Patients will be treated per institutional standard of care protocol.
The prescribed radiation dose will be 8 Gy in 1 fraction prescribed to the planning target 
volume  (PTV) .   
Treatment shall be delivered with megavoltage machines of a minimum energy of 4 MV 
photons or electron machine containing a minimum energy of 4 MeV. Selection of the 
appropriate photon energy should be based on optimizing the radiation dose distribution within 
the target volume and minimizing dose to non-target normal tissue.
The Gross Tumor Volume (GTV) will contain the lytic lesion and/or the extra-osseous lesion 
noted on the simulation CT.  Image fusion to adjust the CT simulation based GTV is allowed.  
The Clinical Target Volume (CTV) will be a 0.5- 2.0 cm margin around the GTV.
The Planning Target Volume (PTV) will be an additional 0.3-1.[ADDRESS_337208]:  Pembrolizumab (MK-3475, IND 130757) 32
Protocol/Amendment No.:  Rad4106-17(MK-3475-749), v6/30/2022
selection ranging from 4 MeV – 20 MeV.  For deeper seated tumors, photon therapy should be 
used with energy range of 4MV – 18 MV, based on appropriate coverage of the PTV.  The 
goals should be to provide adequate coverage, while minimizing hot spots as well as scattered 
radiation dose to the surrounding structures.
A range of radiation fields are allowed.  A single beam, an AP/PA, or multiple beams are 
allowed.   A range of radiation techniques (2D, 3DCRT, IMRT, IMRS) are allowed;
Institutional standard of care protocol will be followed when assessing adequate PTV coverage 
and dose volume histogram normal tissue limits.  
Radiation Toxicity Evaluation
Patients should undergo evaluation for development of acute and chronic radiotherapy toxicity 
at the time of protocol visits. This should be at done at 1 month+/- [ADDRESS_337209]:  Pembrolizumab (MK-3475, IND 130757) 33

9.2 Serum Biomarker Correlates 
We plan to monitor the immune responses of the patients enrolled in this clinical trial, by 
[CONTACT_276272], as outlined above under 
“serum biomarkers”. 
When possible, blood collection will be synchronized to pembrolizumab infusion cycles (C). 
Blood will be collected as outlined in the flow chart; 
Samples will be drawn into three 4-8 ml CPT tubes for PBMC and plasma isolation, and one 
4.5 ml K3EDTA tube, for whole blood analysis. Tubes will be labeled and logged at Emory's 
Winship Cancer Institute by a skilled clinical research nurse or phlebotomist.  They will be 
maintained at room temperature until transport to [CONTACT_276280]'s laboratory. Samples distributed 
to the Ahmed laboratory will only be identifiable by [CONTACT_276273], study identifier 
and a draw date. Samples will be transported in sealed biohazard containers between sites per 
standard protocol. Whole blood and/or PBMC will be used fresh or will be frozen and banked 
for future batch analyses. Plasma will be frozen at -80C. Frozen PBMC samples will be stored 
in liquid nitrogen at the Emory Vaccine center.  All assays will be performed as per Ahmed 
lab standard of practice.   Briefly, frequency and absolute cell counts will be determined for 
the major lymphocyte populations (CD3, CD4, CD8, CD19) and monocytes (CD14) through 
the use of BD TruCount tubes.  Detailed phenotypic analysis will be performed through whole 
blood staining with the following markers; CD3, CD4, CD8, Foxp3, CD45RA, CCR7, CD28, 
CD27, CD127, PD-1, Ki-67, Bcl-2, HLA-DR, CD38, ICOS, CD137, Tbet, eomes, Granzyme 
B, Perforin, CTLA-4, Tim-3, CD14, CD16, CD11c, CD123, PD-L1, CD86. Besides flow 
cytometry phenotypic analysis, sample collected at early time points after irradiation, will be 
used for transcriptional profiling. Frozen plasma will be used for monitoring cytokine 
expression.  Stored blood may also be used to analyze exosomes and/or search for other serum 
biomarker analysis. 
When possible, fresh tumor tissue will be collected from biopsy or surgical procedure (biopsy 
only done, if clinically indicated). Depending on material availability samples will be analyzed 
by [CONTACT_276274].

events, or irAEs). 
Full Physical Exam
The investigator or qualified designee will perform a complete physical exam during the 
screening period.  Clinically significant abnormal findings should be recorded as medical 
history.  A full physical exam should be performed during screening, 
Directed Physical Exam
For cycles that do not require a full physical exam per the Trial Flow Chart, the investigator or 
qualified designee will perform a directed physical exam as clinically indicated prior to trial 
treatment administration.  
1.  Vital Signs
The investigator or qualified designee will take vital signs at screening, prior to the 
administration of each dose of trial treatment and at treatment discontinuation as specified in 
the Trial Flow Chart (Section 9.0).  Vital signs may include temperature, pulse, respi[INVESTIGATOR_862], weight and blood pressure.  Height may be measured at screening only.
2.  Karnofsky Performance Status Scale and ECOG Performance Scale
The investigator or qualified designee may assess ECOG and/or KPS status at screening. 
ECOG status may be assessed prior to the administration of each dose of trial treatment and 
discontinuation of trial treatment as specified in the Trial Flow Chart.  After the initial 
assessment, ECOG alone during subsequent follow-up may be the minimum that is required 
on the trial.
3.  Laboratory Procedures/Assessments
Details regarding specific laboratory procedures/assessments to be performed in this trial are 
provided below. Laboratory tests for hematology, chemistry, urinalysis, and others are

unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product or protocol-
specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product or protocol-
specified procedure.  Any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in 
frequency and/or intensity) of a preexisting condition that is temporally associated with the use 
of the [COMPANY_006]’s product or radiotherapy, is also an adverse event.
Changes resulting from normal growth and development that do not vary significantly in 
frequency or severity from expected levels are not to be considered adverse events.  Examples 
of this may include, but are not limited to, teething, typi[INVESTIGATOR_80034] a physiologically appropriate time.

Adverse events may occur during the course of the use of [COMPANY_006] product or SRS in clinical 
trials or within the follow-up period specified by [CONTACT_760], or prescribed in clinical practice, 
from overdose (whether accidental or intentional), from abuse and from withdrawal.
Adverse events may also occur in screened subjects during any pre-allocation baseline period 
as a result of a protocol-specified intervention, including washout or discontinuation of usual 
therapy, diet, placebo treatment or a procedure.
Progression of the cancer under study is not considered an adverse event unless it is considered 
to be drug related by [CONTACT_093].
All adverse events that occur after the consent form is signed but before treatment

adverse events for outcome.
Definition of an Overdose for This Protocol and Reporting of Overdose to the Sponsor 
and to [COMPANY_006]
For purposes of this trial, an overdose of pembrolizumab will be defined as any dose of 1,000 
mg or greater (≥5 times the indicated dose, for a 100 kg patient).  No specific information is 
available on the treatment of overdose of pembrolizumab. Appropriate supportive treatment 
should be provided if clinically indicated. In the event of overdose, the subject should be 
observed closely for signs of toxicity.  
If an adverse event(s) is associated with (“results from”) the overdose of a [COMPANY_006] product, the 
adverse event(s) is reported as a serious adverse event, even if no other seriousness criteria are 
met.
If a dose of [COMPANY_006]’s product meeting the protocol definition of overdose is taken without any 
associated clinical symptoms or abnormal laboratory results, the overdose is reported as a non-
serious Event of Clinical Interest (ECI), using the terminology “accidental or intentional 
overdose without adverse effect.”
All reports of overdose with and without an adverse event must be reported within 24 hours to 
the Sponsor and within 2 working days hours to [COMPANY_006] Global Safety. (Attn: Worldwide 
Product Safety; FAX [PHONE_1840])
Reporting of Pregnancy and Lactation to the Sponsor and to [COMPANY_006]
Although pregnancy and lactation are not considered adverse events, it is the responsibility of 
investigators or their designees to report any pregnancy or lactation in a subject 
(spontaneously reported to them) that occurs during the trial.
Pregnancies and lactations that occur after the consent form is signed but before treatment 
allocation/randomization must be reported by [CONTACT_105943], or are the result of a protocol-specified intervention, including but not 
limited to washout or discontinuation of usual therapy, diet, placebo treatment or a procedure.  
Pregnancies and lactations that occur from the time of treatment allocation/randomization 
through [ADDRESS_337226] be followed to the completion/termination 
of the pregnancy. Pregnancy outcomes of spontaneous abortion, missed abortion, benign 
hydatidiform mole, blighted ovum, fetal death, intrauterine death, miscarriage and stillbirth 
must be reported as serious events (Important Medical Events). If the pregnancy continues to 
term, the outcome (health of infant) must also be reported.
Such events must be reported within 24 hours to the Sponsor and within 2 working days to

is evidence suggesting a causal relationship between the drug and the event. Any such event 
will be submitted to the Sponsor within 24 hours and to [COMPANY_006] Global Safety within 2 working 
days either by [CONTACT_131008].
Specifically, the suspected/actual events covered in this exception include any event that is 
disease progression of the cancer under study.
The Sponsor will monitor unblinded aggregated efficacy endpoint events and safety data to 
ensure the safety of the subjects in the trial. Any suspected endpoint which upon review is not 
progression of the cancer under study will be forwarded to [COMPANY_006] Global Safety as a SAE 
within 2 working days of determination that the event is not progression of the cancer under 
study
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_77989] (e.g.transportation issues etc.) will not be considered a

Evaluating Adverse Events
An investigator who is a qualified physician will evaluate all adverse events according to the 
NCI Common Terminology for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.0. Any adverse event 
which changes CTCAE grade over the course of a given epi[INVESTIGATOR_110507]/worksheets.
All adverse events regardless of CTCAE grade must also be evaluated for seriousness.

Table 6 Evaluating Adverse Events
Known  acute side effects for SRS include: Alopecia within the portal sites, fatigue, headache, nausea, vomiting, worsening baseline 
neurological deficits due to increased edema or radionecrosis, seizure, skin irritation or redness; Late side effects include radiation 
necrosis, secondary cancer, seizure, worsening neurological deficit due to edema, death, hair loss within the portal fields.  
An investigator who is a qualified physician, will evaluate all adverse events as to:
V4.0 CTCAE 
GradingGrade 1 Mild; asymptomatic or mid symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not indicated.
Grade 2 Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age-appropriate instrumental ADL.
Grade 3 Severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_77991]; disabling; 
limiting self-care ADL.
Grade 4 Life threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.
Grade [ADDRESS_337233] that:
†Results in death; or
†Is life threatening; or places the subject, in the view of the investigator, at immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred (Note: This does not include an 
adverse event that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.); or
†Results in a persistent or significant disability/incapacity (substantial disruption of one’s ability to conduct normal life functions); or
†Results in or prolongs an existing inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_19357], regardless of length of stay, even if the

Is an overdose (whether accidental or intentional).  Any adverse event associated with an overdose is considered a serious adverse event for collection purposes. An 
overdose that is not associated with an adverse event is considered a non-serious event of clinical interest and must be reported within [ADDRESS_337234] and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed 
previously (designated above by a †).
Duration Record the start and stop dates of the adverse event. If less than [ADDRESS_337235] to be discontinued?
Relationship to 
[COMPANY_006] Product Did [COMPANY_006] product cause the adverse event? The determination of the likelihood that [COMPANY_006]  product caused the adverse event will be provided by [CONTACT_75368] a qualified physician. The investigator’s signed/dated initials on the source document or worksheet that supports the causality noted on the AE form, ensures that a 
medically qualified assessment of causality was done. This initialed document must be retained for the required regulatory time frame. The criteria below are intended 
as reference guidelines to assist the investigator in assessing the likelihood of a relationship between the test drug and the adverse event based upon the available 
information.
The following components are to be used to assess the relationship between [COMPANY_006] product and the AE; the greater the correlation with the components and their 
respective elements (in number and/or intensity), the more likely [COMPANY_006] product caused the adverse event (AE):
Exposure Is there evidence that the subject was actually exposed to [COMPANY_006] product such as: reliable history, acceptable compliance assessment (pi[INVESTIGATOR_692], 
diary, etc.), expected pharmacologic effect, or measurement of drug/metabolite in bodily specimen?
Time Course Did the AE follow in a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of [COMPANY_006] product? 
Is the time of onset of the AE compatible with a drug-induced effect (applies to trials with investigational medicinal product)?
Likely Cause Is the AE not reasonably explained by [CONTACT_26369], other drug(s)/vaccine(s), or other host or environmental factors

Sponsor Responsibility for Reporting Adverse Events
Written IND safety reports will be submitted to the FDA by [CONTACT_106507], for serious, 
unexpected suspected adverse reactions within 15 calendar days of learning of its occurrence. 
If the event is fatal or is deemed to be life threatening, the report will be made within 7 calendar 
days.  The IND sponsor will also make an assessment of whether the event constitutes an 
unanticipated problem posing risks to subjects or others (UP). This assessment will be provided 
to the Emory University IRB, which, in turn will make a final determination.  If the Emory 
IRB determines an event is a UP it will notify the appropriate regulatory agencies and 
institutional officials.

11. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS PLAN
1.Statistical Analysis Plan Summary
Study Design 
The study is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_276262]-1 inhibitor and SRS for 
relapsed/refractory myeloma.  A total of 24 patients will be enrolled on the trial (20 is 
the minimum, with an additional 4 patients, to make for any attrition and/or loss to 
follow-up). [ADDRESS_337236] Clopper-Pearson 95% 
confidence interval for a 20% rate based on 5 responses in 20 patients is (0.087, 0.491), 
with a precision of 0.185.  If we see lower than 20% difference in rate of toxicity at 3 
months, the combination will be deemed safe. 
A minimum of 20 patients are required to complete full treatments. An additional 20% 
is allowed for drop out/failure to adhere to required follow-up and treatment 
recommendations. Thus, 24 patients will be allowed to be enrolled on the trial to make 
for any attrition and/or loss to follow-up. [ADDRESS_337237]

13.0 DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING PLAN 
The Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) of the Winship Cancer Institute will 
provide oversight for the conduct of this study.  The DSMC functions independently within 
Winship Cancer Institute to conduct internal monitoring functions to ensure that research 
being conducted by [CONTACT_163845]-quality scientific 
data in a manner consistent with good clinical practice (GCP) and appropriate regulations 
that govern clinical research.    Depending on the risk level of the protocol, the DSMC 
review may occur every [ADDRESS_337240] 5 
subjects being reviewed.  Subsequent monitoring will occur in routine intervals per the 
Winship Data and Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP). 
The DSMC will review pertinent aspects of the study to assess subject safety, compliance 
with the protocol, data collection, and risk-benefit ratio. Specifically, the Winship Cancer 
Institute Internal Monitors assigned to the DSMC may verify informed consent, eligibility, 
data entry, accuracy and availability of source documents, AEs/SAEs, and essential 
regulatory documents.  Following the monitoring review, monitors will provide a preliminary 
report of monitoring findings to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_276263].  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_276264].  Prior to the completion of the final summary report, monitors will 
discuss the preliminary report responses with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_163791] (when 
appropriate).  A final monitoring summary report will then be prepared by [CONTACT_2037].  Final 
DSMC review will include the final monitoring summary report with corresponding PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_163792], submitted CAPA (when applicable), PI [INVESTIGATOR_228415], and available 
aggregate toxicity and safety data.  
The DSMC will render a recommendation and rating based on the overall trial conduct.  The 
PI [INVESTIGATOR_276265].  Continuing Review submissions will include the DSMC recommendation letter.  
Should any revisions be made to the protocol-specific monitoring plan after initial DSMC

APPENDIX III
Tumor Assessment per Immune-Related Response Criteria
Immune-related Response Criteria (irRC) are derived from modified World Health
Organization (mWHO) conventions. Assessments of lymph nodes are derived from
current RECIST guidelines.
a.) Definitions of Measurable/non-Measurable Lesions
All measurable and non-measurable lesions should be assessed at the initial 
Screening/enrollment, at the defined tumor assessment time points (see Time and Events 
Schedule), and during regular maintenance.  Additional assessments may be performed, as 
clinically indicated for suspi[INVESTIGATOR_55519]. The Investigator will base response to 
treatment using the irRC.
i.) Measurable Disease
Measurable non-lymph node disease is defined as lesions that can be accurately 
measured in [ADDRESS_337245], 0.5cm thickness slice: both diameters must be at least > 1.0cm
-For > 0.5cm thickness slices: larger diameter >2.0cm; the other > 1.0cm
Lymph nodes are measurable only if CT slice thickness is <0.5cm. Size criteria are that 
the lymph node be at least 15 mm in short axis.
ii.) Non-Measurable Lesions
Non-measurable (evaluable) lesions are all other lesions, including one-dimensional
measurable disease and small lesions (not meeting the above criteria), and any of the 
following: 
-lesions occurring in a previously irradiated, extracranial area (unless they are 
documented as new lesions since the completion of radiation therapy), 
Product:  Pembrolizumab (MK-3475, IND 130757) 60
Protocol/Amendment No.:  Rad4106-17(MK-3475-749), v6/30/2022
 
bone lesions, 
-leptomeningeal disease, 
-ascites,
-effusion (pleural or pericardial)
-cystic lesions
-abdominal masses not histological confirmed
Lymph nodes with a short axis < 10 mm are considered not pathological, and are not 
measurable.
b.) Definitions of Index/non-Index Lesions
i.) Index Lesions
Measurable lesions, up to a maximum of [ADDRESS_337246] be 
selected based on their size (e.g., lesions with the longest diameters), their suitability 
for accurate repeat assessment by [CONTACT_15218], and how representative they are 
of the subject’s tumor burden. At Screening, a Sum of the Product Diameters (SPD) for 
all index lesions will be calculated and considered the baseline SPD. The baseline sum 
will be used as the reference point to determine the objective tumor response of the 
index lesions at tumor
assessment.
ii.) Non Index Lesions
Measurable lesions, other than index lesions, and all sites of non-measurable disease, 
will be identified as non-index lesions. Non-index lesions will be evaluated at the same 
assessment time points as the index lesions. After the initial assessment, changes in 
non-index lesions will contribute only in the assessment of complete response.

Protocol/Amendment No.:  Rad4106-17(MK-3475-749), v6/30/2022
 
c.) Calculation of Sum of Product of Diameters (SPD)
Sum of Product of Diameters is an estimate of tumor burden. The [ADDRESS_337247] of the diameters for index tumor lesions. Several
variations of the SPD are identified for the purpose of classification of tumor responses.
i.) SPD at Baseline 
The sum of the product of the diameters for all index lesions identified at baseline prior 
to treatment on Day 1.
ii.) SPD at tumor assessment
 For every on-study tumor assessment collected per protocol or as clinically indicated, 
the SPD at tumor assessment will be calculated using tumor imaging scans. All index 
lesions and all new measurable lesions that have emerged after baseline will contribute 
to the SPD at tumor assessment (irSPD).
iii.) SPD at NADIR
For tumors that are assessed more than [ADDRESS_337248] value of the 
SPD (SPD Baseline or SPD at tumor assessment) is used to classify subsequent tumor 
assessments for each subject. The SPD at tumor assessment using the irRC for 
progressive disease incorporates the contribution of new measurable lesions. Each net 
percentage change in tumor burden per assessment using irRC accounts for the size and 
growth kinetics of both old and new lesions as they appear. In this study the irRC as 
defined by [CONTACT_276277].

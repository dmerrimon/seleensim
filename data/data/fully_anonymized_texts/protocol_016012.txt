 1 INTRODUCTION 
1.1 Background 
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a common, chronic, systemic, progressive, autoim mune disease 
causing inflammation and pathology throughout the body, but perhaps most noticeably in the 
peripheral joints of the skeleton (i.e. hands, feet, knees, hips, etc.). It has been estimated that 52.2 million U.S. adults suffer from arthritis of which 1.3 million adults suffer from RA ( CDC , 
Helmick et al. ). In the affected joints, RA is characterized by [CONTACT_779636], proliferation of synovial fibroblastic  tissue (pannus), and joint destruction ( Ma et 
al.). RA causes joint pain, stiffness and reduced mobility. If not successfully treated, joint 
inflammation and destruction in RA patients can lead to crippling loss of function, severe chronic pain, and disfigurement of the joints. Also, RA patients have significantly higher risk 
of coronary heart disease including acute myocardial infarction (odds ratio = 3.17) ( Maradit -
Kremers  et al. ). Patients with uncontrolled RA may also suffer a reduction of 3- 10 years in 
their life expectancies ( Carmona et al. ). RA can strike anyone at any age, but is diagnosed most 
frequently in women in their 40s and 50s ( Oliver  et al. ). Worldwide, about one adult in every 
[ADDRESS_1071544] RA ( Helmick et al. , 
Scott et al. ). Because RA is a chronic disease, the prevalence of RA increases with age. Because 
of aging demographics in the [LOCATION_002] and elsewhere, the number of patients with RA and the burden of RA on society are expected to increase in the coming decades ( Hootman et al. ). 
Therefor e, there is a significant current and growing need to manage RA patients more 
effectively to limit the morbidity and mortality caused by [CONTACT_14687].  
 
Over the last decade or so, disease- modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) have 
transformed RA therapy. First line  DMARD therapy is usually methotrexate ( Scott et al. ). In 
addition, a number of biologic DMARDs have been developed. Basic research on the 
pathobiology of RA revealed that the inflammation observed in RA is the consequence of a 
self-perpetuating disturbance in the expression and downstream signaling of a network of 
cytokines ( Raza et al. , Olszewski et al. , Meyer et al. ). At the center of this cytokine network is 
the overexpression of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) by [CONTACT_779637] ( Leizer et 
al., Westra et al. , Hamilton et al. , Keffer et al. , Noack et al. , Bugatti et al. , Boissier et al. , Tran 
et al. , Kinne et al. ). TNFα then induces IL -1 and other cytokines that together with TNFα 
mediate the inflammation and joint damage characteristic of RA ( Leizer et al. , Zwerina et al. , 
Feldmann et al. , Schett et al. ). These findings led to the development of biologic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_779610]α (i.e., etanercept, infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab pegol, and golimumab) ( Scott et al. , Kalden et al. , Wiedmann et al. , Chen et al. ). In addition, other biologic 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_779611]. These include abatacept (targeting T -cell stimulation), 
rituximab (targeting B -cells), and tocilizumab (targeting the IL -6 receptor) (Vivar et al. ). 
Generally, the biologic DMARDs are used as second line therapi[INVESTIGATOR_140546] r RA, either alone or with 
methotrexate, in patients who have failed methotrexate monotherapy ( Wasserman et al. , Saag 
et al. ). All of the DMARDs can cause serious adverse side effects ( Choy et al. , Donahue et al. ). 
Therefore, patients on DMARDs require close monitoring to manage and minimize their adverse side effect risks. Also, there is a need, not yet fully satisfied, to monitor the effectiveness of DMARD therapy to further minimize these risks and to optimize the benefits 
Tc 99m tilmanocept   Navidea Biopharmaceuticals, Inc 
Clinical Study Protocol Number: NAV3 -21  Date: [ADDRESS_1071545], the goals of RA therapy were to reduce the severity 
of symptoms and limit the rate of progression of the illness. Today, the goal is remission (Gramling et al. ). Also, RA patients taking TNFα antagonists have a reduced risk for 
cardiovascular disease events ( Barbhaiya et al. ). 
 There are two barriers preventing more RA patients from achieving disease remission ( By[CONTACT_779638]. ). Both of these barriers may be remedied by [CONTACT_779639]. Firstly, DMARD therapy is 
much more effective when provided soon after the onset of RA symptoms and declines in efficacy if initiation of DMARD therapy is delayed ( Demoruell e et al. ). Currently, and as 
described in the next section, early diagnosis of RA is problematic. Secondly, even when DMARD therapy is provided soon after the onset of symptoms, a significant  minority of patients do not respond or respond poorly, demonstrating the continuing need for new and better DMARD therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] ( Sacre et al. ). For example, in a study reported by [CONTACT_480969]. 
(Anderson et al.), the authors found that the time between the onset of RA symptoms and the 
initiation of methotrexate therapy was inversely associated with the response rate for therapy (p = 0.001). In another study of 598 RA patients who were followed for a number of years after their RA diagnosis ( van der L inden et al. ), patients who initiated therapy more than [ADDRESS_1071546] -free 
remission (HR= 1.87) and experienced greater long term joint damage when compared with 
patients who initiated therapy within 12 weeks of symptom onset. These studies and the observations of others ( Nell et al. , Cush et al. ) indicate that early diagnosis of RA affords a 
“window of opportunity” for the greatest probability of effective RA therapy and the possibility of disease remission.  Delayed diagnosis increases the chance of DMARD treatment failure. Furthermore, even in the best of circumstances, the response rate for RA therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] i s in the 
50%- 70% range ( Choy et al. , By[CONTACT_684831]. , Sacre et al. , Zwerina et al. ),indicating the continued 
need for better DMARD therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
 The g rowing realization that early diagnosis of RA can positively impact treatment efficacy 
and long term patient outcomes motivated the American College of Rheumatology and the European League Against Rheumatism (ACR/EULAR) to collaborate on the development of  
new diagnostic criteria for RA. The results of this collaboration were published in 2010 as the ACR/EULAR 2010 criteria ( Aletaha et al. ). These new criteria replaced the older 1987 ACR 
criteria and were largely hailed as a “game changer” for the diagnosis and management of RA (Cohen et al. ). Since its publication, the ACR/EULAR [ADDRESS_1071547] been evaluated in a 
number of studies to determine which patients presenting with polyarthralgia progress to RA (Humphreys et al.). For example, in one study 313 undifferentiated arthritis patients were 
evaluated at presentation and again after 1 year of follow up for a clinical diagnosis of RA and/or the initiation of methotrexa te therapy ( Berglin et al. ). At baseline, 56% of patients 
fulfilled the 1987 ACR criteria, while 74% fulfilled the ACR/EULAR 2010 criteria for having RA. Compared with the diagnosis at follow up, the ACR/EULAR [ADDRESS_1071548] made similar observations ( Varache et al. , Liao et al. , Biliavska et al. , de Hair et al. , Alves et 
al., Britsemmer et al. , Cader et al. , Kaneko et al. , van der Linden et al.). Sakellariou et al.  
Tc 99m tilmanocept   Navidea Biopharmaceuticals, Inc 
Clinical Study Protocol Number: NAV3 -21  Date: 19 June 2018  
Confidential  Page 22 of 83 
 recently published a meta- analysis of this literature. They obse rved that the sensitivity and 
specificity of the ACR/EULAR 2010 criteria were 0.73 (CI: 0.64,0.80) and 0.74 (CI: 0.68,0.79) 
respectively. Clearly, there is significant risk of misclassification. As stated by [CONTACT_779640] , 
“overdiagnosis and under -diagnosis may become important issues if the (ACR/EULAR 2010) 
criteria recommend” DMARD therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. While the ACR/EULAR [ADDRESS_1071549] therapy from which they will not benefit and which exposes them to risks from adverse side effects ( Vonkeman et al. ). Therefore, there is a critical 
unmet need for a more sensitive and specific diagnostic for RA that can differentiate patients first presenting with polyarthralgia and identify those with RA to facilitate the more efficacious delivery of DMARD therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. 
 While many types of cells, including T -cells, B -cells, dendritic cells and activated synovial 
fibroblasts contribute significantly to the esta blishment and maintenance of the pathology of 
RA, ( Ma et al. , Noack et al. , Bugatti et al. , Boissier et al. , Tran et al. ) macrophages play a 
critical role in RA ( Kinne et al. ). They produce most of the TNFα that drives and perpetuates 
the inflammatory cycle in RA ( Leizer et al. , Westra et al. , Hamilton et al. , Keffer et al. , Noack 
et al. , Bugatti et al. , Boissier et al. , Tran et  al., Kinne et al. , Zwerina et al. , Feldman et al. , 
Schett et al. ). In the synovial sublining of a joint affected by [CONTACT_14687], macrophages are the dominant 
cell type ( Kraan et al. , Cutolo et al. ). In the inflamed joint as a whole, macrophages in RA 
patients make up at least 30% -40% of all cells ( Kennedy et al. ). Furthe rmore, macrophages 
participate directly in the destruction of bone and cartilage ( Ma et al. ). Activated macrophage 
populations and synoviocytes are the predominant cell types at the interface between pannus 
and cartilage and secrete d estructive proteases in abundance ( Bresnihan et al. ). As a result, it 
may not be surprising that synovial macrophage numbers —but not the numbers of other 
immune cell types —correlate with radiographically determined joint destruction in RA 
(Mulherin et al. , Yanni et al. ). While  macrophages may play a role in other pathologies that 
cause joint pain and inflammation, the degree to which macrophages are involved in the pathological process of RA and the sheer mass or volume of macrophages that infiltrate the 
joints inflamed due to RA differentiates RA from other rheumatic diseases. Therefore, detection of the density or numbers of macrophages in inflamed joints may permit differentiation of patients with RA from those with other causes of arthritis. In addition, it is 
known that the RA pathology begins significantly before, perhaps years before, the onset of symptoms (i.e., joint pain and inflammation) and well before the beginning of bone destruction (Deane et al. , El-Gabalawy et al. ). Macrophage infiltration of synovial tissues precedes 
development of clinical signs of RA in animal studies ( Kraan et al. ). In humans, macrophage 
infiltrations of synovial tissues are present when RA patients first develop clinical symptoms (Demoruelle et al. , van de Sande et al. ). Therefore, detect ion of the density or numbers of 
macrophages in inflamed joints may facilitate more sensitive and specific identification of RA patients as soon as they present with symptoms and early in the course of their illnesses when DMARDs are likely to be most effective.  
 An interesting and important observation that has been made in many studies is that the number of macrophages in synovial tissue, and particularly in the synovial sublining, declines in RA 
Tc 99m tilmanocept   Navidea Biopharmaceuticals, Inc 
Clinical Study Protocol Number: NAV3 -21  Date: [ADDRESS_1071550] therapy (Hamilton et al. ). Furthermore, the degree to 
which synovial macrophage numbers decline is correlated with the magnitude of the DMARD 
treatment response. One study compared changes in the 28 joint count Disease Activity Score (DAS28) with changes in sublining macrophage numbers as determined by [CONTACT_779641] a significant correlation between the change in the number of macrophages and the change in DAS28 (Pearson correlation 0.874, p < 0.01) ( Haringman et al .). The authors of this study have 
confirmed these findings in two additional studies, which used slightly different methodologies (Bresnihan et al. , Bresnihan et al. ). This correlation between declining macrophage numbers 
and the efficacy of DMARD therapy appears to be largely independent of the kind of DMARD therapy being investigated ( Hamilton et al. , Kinne et al. , Franz et al. , Kraan et al. , Catrina et 
al., Cunnane et al., Vieira -Sousa et al. ). These findings indicate that assaying the number of 
macr ophages in inflamed joints of patients with RA could be used as an objective measure of 
the efficacy of DMARD therapy. These findings further suggest that assaying the number of macrophages in inflamed joints of patients with RA could be used in clinical s tudies as a 
biomarker of clinical response for potential new RA therapeutics. The problem with current methodologies is that macrophage numbers and densities need to be determined with synovial biopsies. This is obviously an invasive procedure that samples  only a small portion of the 
inflamed synovial tissue and is painful and unpleasant for the patient. What would be preferable and likely more accurate is an imaging protocol, such as the one proposed in this application, that can assay synovial macrophages more completely and less invasively.  
 
1.[ADDRESS_1071551]. Thomas Rosol, DVM PhD FACVP, Professor, Veterinary Biosciences investigated CD206 expression and tilmanocept binding to synovial macrophages in an anti -type II collagen 
monoclonal antibody induced mouse model of RA ( Hutamekalin et al. ).  Evidence of arthritis 
in this model (joint swelling and redness) developed in 5- 6 days, and on days 9 or 11, mice 
were imaged 1 -2 hours after they had received an intravenous (IV) injection of Cy3-
tilmanocept. The mice were then euthanized followed by [CONTACT_779642]. The primary result of this experiment was that Cy3 -tilmanocept administered intravenously 
localized to synovial macrophages in the affected joints of arthritic mice but not control mice (Figure 1  and Figure  2).

The success of these studies in mice strongly supports the feasibility and likely success of the 
proposed studies in humans.  Further support for this notion could be derived from ex vivo  
experiments carried out that showed specific binding of Cy3- tilmanocept to human synovial 
macrophages obtained from patients with active RA but not osteoarthritis (OA) patients who were undergoing therapeutic/diagnostic arthrocentesis ( Figure 3 ).   In these experiments the 
synovial cells were isolated by a ficoll gradient and the cells stained with a variety of surface markers to identify the cell type that can stain with Cy3 -tilman ocept.  Flow cytometry contour 
plots from two representative RA and OA patients demonstrate a significant population of macrophages that stain with Cy3 -tilmanocept in RA but is largely absent in OA  (A) and

 Lymphoseek (technetium Tc 99m tilmanocept) is a radiotracer that accumulates in lymphatic 
tissue by [CONTACT_4639] a mannose binding receptor that resides on the surface of dendritic cells 
and macrophages within the nodes. Tilmanocept is a macromolecule consisting of multiple 
units of DTPA (diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid) and mannose, each synthetically attached to a [ADDRESS_1071552] lymphoscintigraphy has been perform ed using Tc 99m sulfur colloid (TcSC) particles (50 to 800 nm in size) that are 
nonselectively removed by [CONTACT_779643]. Tilmanocept  has a diameter of about 7 
nm, which is substantially smaller than current radiolabeled agents used for targeting lymphoid tissue. Tilmanocept ’ s small diameter permits enhanced diffusion into lymph nodes and blood 
capi[INVESTIGATOR_11037], resulting in a rapid injection site clearance. Lymphoseek has demonstrated less injection pain perception by [CONTACT_1962], faster injection site transit, more successful localization of lymph nodes, and detection of more lymph nodes in the lymphatic drainage pathways in subsets of patients receiving Lymphoseek compared with other subsets having sulfur colloid. 
Lymphoseek is approved by [CONTACT_36432] ([LOCATION_002]) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for 
use in lymphatic mappi[INVESTIGATOR_779612] a primary tumor site in patients with solid tumors for which this procedure is a component of intraoperative management and for guiding sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in patients with clinically node negative squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the oral cavity, breast cancer, or melanoma.  
Lymphoseek is approved in the European Union (EU) for use in imaging and intraoperative detect ion of sentinel lymph nodes draining a primary tumor in adult patients with breast cancer, 
melanoma, or localized squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity. 
1.3 Previous Nonclinical Research and Clinical Trial Experience 
Tilmanocept and Lymphoseek 
A detailed evaluation of safety and efficacy data from nonclinical and clinical studies can be found in the accompanying Investigator’s Brochure supplied by [CONTACT_779644], Inc.  In addition, the data described in this protocol are reported in peer -review ed publications, 
including nonclinical studies ( Hoh et al., 2003 ), the Phase 1 clinical trials ( Ellner et al. ; Wallace 
et al. ; Wallace et al. ; Wallace et al. ; Wallace et al. ), the Phase 2 clinical trial ( Leong et al. ) and 
the Phase 3 studies ( Tokin et al.; Sondak et al.; Wallace et al. ; Marcinow et al. , Agrawal et al., 
2015).   
1.3.1  Nonclinical Evaluations  – Injection Site Subcutaneous  
Nonclinical studies with Lymphoseek or tilmanocept demonstrated that the drug selectively 
binds to its intended receptor (the CD206 mannose binding receptor), is appropriately 
distributed for radio- detection of lymphatic tissue, and is well tolerated by [CONTACT_116434], rabbits, guinea 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_14107], and dogs. 
Pharmacokinetics data obtained from nonclinical studies demonstrated rapid absorption into 
the plasma. Urinary excretion was a major pathway of elimination. Lymphoseek exhibited rapid clearance from the injection site, rapid uptake by [CONTACT_214958], and low uptake by [CONTACT_779645]. Tilmanocept was well tolerated at all doses tested in nonclinical 
Tc 99m tilmanocept   Navidea Biopharmaceuticals, Inc 
Clinical Study Protocol Number: NAV3 -21  Date: [ADDRESS_1071553] level (NOAEL) was 42μg/kg/day. Tilmanocept was not mutagenic or 
genotoxic in vitro or in vivo. No signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity were observed in a study in guinea pi[INVESTIGATOR_14107].  
1.3.2  Nonclinical Evaluations – IV AND IP Administration  
Dosing in Dogs, Guinea Pi[INVESTIGATOR_779613]:  IV dosing in IND submitted non- clinical studies 
represents, cumulative dosing in male and female beagle dogs [eight dogs (4/sex; wt ♀= 7.6 
kg;  wt ♂ = 10.5 kg ) given an intravenous injection of saline on Study Day (SD) 1 and 2 and DTPA-mannosyl- dextran at 0.084 mg/kg on SD 4, 0.42 mg/kg on SD 6, and 0.84 mg/kg on 
SD 8 and 10] 1,560X the 50 µg and 195X the 400 µg dose (female dogs) and 1706X the 50 µg dose and 213X the 400µg dose (male dogs).   Based on the highest single dose administration (0.84 mg/kg) the dogs received 600X the 50 µg and 75X the 400 µg dose (female dogs) and 657X the 50 µg and 82X the 400 µg dose (male dogs). [NOTE: In a separate dog study the dose was 0.56 mg/kg in 2 each ♂ and ♀ dogs of similar weight/sex), no effect was noted in that study, consistent with the higher dose dog study]. 
With regard to the sensitization test (IV administration in guinea pi[INVESTIGATOR_14107], wt = 0.415 kg) the 
maximum dose was the equivalent of 96X of the anticipated high dose tilmanocept. 
Lastly, although IP administered  in mice, based on the highest single dose administration (2000 
mg/kg) the mice received 300,0000X the 50 µg and 37,500X the 400 µg dose (♀ mice, wt = 
22 gm) and 340,000X the 50 µg and 42,500X the 400 µg dose (♂ mice, wt = 29 gm).

Conclusions from These Tests:  
CNS:  In conclusion, a single  intravenous administration of t ilmanocept was well tolerated in 
rats at levels of 0.15, 0.75, and 1.50 mg/kg. Brief sedation shortly after dosing was observed 
at 0.75 and 1.50 mg/kg, which resolved by [CONTACT_779648] -dextran content of tilmanocept. There were no 
tilmanocept -related effects on functional observational battery parameters.  
Single Bolus Toxicity:  Tilmanocept -related clinical pathology changes were limited to 
minimally greater, dose -related,  aspartate aminotransferase values for 0.75 and 1.5 mg/kg 
males and females that were likely caused by [CONTACT_779649] -related clinical pathology parameters. This change had resolved 
at the end of the recovery phase.

Focal erosion in the stomach was test article related in males at ≥0.75 mg/kg, but was considered to be of little toxicological significance. No test article -related organ weight 
changes were noted.  At the end  of the recovery phase (Day 15), there were no test article -
related findings in gross pathology, organ weights, or histopathology. 
Respi[INVESTIGATOR_696]: In conclusion, respi[INVESTIGATOR_779616]:CD(SD) rats given 
a single intravenous injection dose of vehicle control article or 0 .150, 0.300, or 0.750 mg/kg 
of tilmanocept at a dose volume of 3 m L/kg.  Administration of tilmanocept had no effect on 
mortality, but it was associated with severe abnormal clinical observations of hypoactivity, ataxia, labored or irregular respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], and pale skin of entire body for animals given 0.750 
mg/kg.  Administration of >0.150 mg/kg tilmanocept had no direct effect on respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487], but it was associated with higher tidal volume (up to +26, +14, and +50% in animals given

respectively).  
Hemolysis:  No hemolysis and no flocculation were observed following in vitro treatment of 
human whole blood with tilmanocept at final whole blood concentrations of 2.5, 25 or 250 μg/mL.  
Ion Channels (Na+, K+, Ca2+):  Although there is a small dose -dependent effect that is 
fractional  to the positive control, variability within concentration renders the median value 
observations not significantly different (Kruskal- Wallis).  
1.3.3  Clinical Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics  
In Phase 1 clinical trials, Lymphoseek showed rapid injection site clearance (approximately 2 to 3 hours). Absolute uptake in the primary sentinel lymph node was dose -related for 
Lymphoseek, although relative nodal uptake (%ID
SN) overall was independent of dose and 
ranged from 0.05%ID SN to 1.81%ID SN. 
In a Phase 2 trial, Lymphoseek was highly effective  in identifying tumor -draining lymph nodes 
(i.e., overall, a “hot spot” from Lymphoseek was identified in 93.0% of patients for whom preoperative lymphoscintigraphy was performed, and the per -patient intraoperative 
localization rate was 96.2%). Diagnostic performance of in vivo Lymphoseek findings relative to pathology assessment of tumor tissue indicated a high per tissue sensitivity estimate (overall, 92.0%). The overall false negative rate (FNR) for pathology was 8.0%, supporting the accuracy of Lymphose ek in identifying lymph nodes with a high potential for containing tumor 
metastases in the lymphatics draining the tumor bed.  
1.3.[ADDRESS_1071556] cancer and melan oma, comparing lymph node detection of Lymphoseek and vital blue dye

The detection concordance between Lymphoseek and VBD was si milar among subjects with 
melanoma and subjects with breast cancer (meta- analysis concordance rate = 99.99% for both 
populations). Lymphoseek also demonstrated a higher sensitivity for detecting tumor-positive (as confirmed by [CONTACT_56618]) lymph nodes, corre sponding to a decreased FNR when compared 
with VBD on a per node basis. The corresponding sensitivity rate in detection of lymph nodes most likely to be positive for tumor cells for Lymphoseek was 99.99%, compared with 78.02% for VBD. The FNR for VBD (21.98%) was higher than the FNR for Lymphoseek (0.01%). These findings suggest that, when VBD is used as the imaging agent, there is an increased risk of missing the detection of tumor -involved lymph nodes and incorrectly staging cancer 
patients. The Lymphosee k-only findings (pathology -positive nodes that were hot/not blue) 
suggest that Lymphoseek was markedly more effective in identifying lymph nodes that harbored disease than was VBD. 
Tc 99m tilmanocept   Navidea Biopharmaceuticals, Inc 
Clinical Study Protocol Number: NAV3 -21  Date: [ADDRESS_1071557] pi[INVESTIGATOR_9205] 3 clinical trial was conducted in subjects with oral cavity or cutaneous 
SCC.  Subjects received an injection of Lymphoseek prior to surgery for excision of the primary tumor and Lymphoseek- guided sentinel lymph node (SLN) dissection followed by 
[CONTACT_779650]. All excised lymph nodes (Lymphoseek- identified SLNs as 
well as non -SLNs) underwent histopathologic evaluation for presence of metastatic disease. 
The primary endpoint in this trial was the Lymphoseek FNR (subjects with pathology -positive 
lymph node(s) not identified by [CONTACT_352090]). Thirty -nine subjects had at least one 
pathology- positive lymph node, and Lymphoseek detected nodes with positive pathology in 
all but one patient. The FNR in this trial was 2.56%.  
1.3.5   Clinical Safety  
Well over 180,000 patients in clinical trials and US commerc ial use for ILM  (intraoperative 
lymphatic mappi[INVESTIGATOR_007])  with SLNB have been exposed to Lymphoseek, and there have been no 
safety signals, no deaths due to drug, and no SAEs (Serious Adverse Events) due to 
Lymphoseek. There are no known drug interactions leading  to contraindications with the use 
of Lymphoseek.  Post marketing reports have shown less than 0.12% of subjects experiencing 
adverse events, with the most common one being lack of node localization.

NOTE: Adverse Drug Reaction 
An Adverse drug reaction (ADR) includes all noxious and unintended responses to a medicinal 
product related to any dose  or dose regimen. The phrase “responses to a medicinal product ” 
means that a casual relationship between a medicinal product and an adverse event is at least 
a reasonable possibility, i.e. the relationship cannot be ruled out. In this multi- center trial, doses will be serially assigned in an open label fashion in accordance 
with Table 1. Investigators who have identified a subject for participation will receive the dose 
assignment from the sponsor and request that dose from the supporting  Cardinal Health 
pharmacy.

The DAS28 will be calculated from four components : tender joint count (TJC), swollen joint 
count (SJC), Visual analogue scale (VAS) of the subject’s global health, and the laboratory 
parameter erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR).  The formula used to calculate the DAS28 
score is:  DAS28 = 0.56*√( TJC) + 0.28*√( SJC) + 0.70*L N(ESR) + 0.014*VAS).  See

recommendation for that day’s scan schedule. 
Whenever possible subject s should be asked to void after injection and prior to the first imaging 
session and again between imaging sessions.  Subjects should be positioned supi[INVESTIGATOR_779619]. The subject’s head, legs, hands, 
and hips should be in the true anterior position. The subject should be instructed to remain as motionless as possible during the scan, and asked to breathe as shallowly as comfortable when 
the camera is passing over the chest. To help minimize leg motion, a light tap ing around the 
ankles can be used to keep the legs together. A pi[INVESTIGATOR_779620].  
A whole body (head to toe) planar scan us ing auto -contour should be obtained at the following 
time points:

 Groups 10-11 (see Appendix 3 ): 
• 15 ± [ADDRESS_1071602] administration  
• 60 ± [ADDRESS_1071603] administration  
• 180 ± [ADDRESS_1071604] administration  
• 18-[ADDRESS_1071605] administration 
 
It is anticipated that the whole body scan would be acquired for 25-30 minutes. Using state-
of-the- art 2-headed cameras (nominal 20” x 15” FOV) a target of 5-[ADDRESS_1071606]’s “thickness” (i.e. from a lateral visual view, the height of the subject’s anterior -most chest/abdomen above the scan bed) should be docume nted. This will 
be used for the attenuation correction to be applied to the anterior/posterior views obtained from the whole body scan. 
Following the whole body acquisition, a planar image with both hands in the FOV should be 
acquired for ~ 5- 7 minutes in both the anterior and posterior view  for subjects in Groups 1-9 
and subjects in Groups 10 and 11 at 60 ± 15 and 180 ± [ADDRESS_1071607]- administration .  
For subjects enrolled in Groups 1- 9: Following completion of the the planar imag ing session 
at [ADDRESS_1071608]/CT should be obtained on Joints A and B, followed by 
a patient break . Following the [ADDRESS_1071609]/CT will be repeated for joint A and completed for joint B and/ or C in 
accordance with the prioritization below.  No greater than [ADDRESS_1071610]/CT imaging 
sessions will be obtain ed after the whole body planar imaging session . 
In the event that multiple joints of interest are identified during whole body planar imaging, and the planar image of the hands, the following prioritization will be applied for the selection of joints for SPECT or SPECT/CT imaging.  Prioritization for joint selection may  be revised 
after review of the first group of images. Any changes in the prior itization for joint selection 
will be communicated to investigators prior to the fulfillment of additional doses.  Images will 
be obtained with bilateral joints in the field of view, including both hands, shoulders, elbows, knees.   
“Greatest interest ” will be defined as the joint of highest Tc99m localization on imaging and 
as guided by [CONTACT_779656] [ADDRESS_1071611]/CT  of Joint A will occur a fter the [ADDRESS_1071612] (knee or elbow or shoulder) or the 
hands if not already imaged as Joint A. 3D SPECT or SPECT/CT  of Joint  B will 
follow the 180 minute whole body scan.

Visit 2, Day [ADDRESS_1071614]/CT scan would be acquired (at one bed position) 
for 25 -30 minutes (30 minutes preferre d). A break should address the  comfort of the patient , 
encouraging the subject to void, consume fluids or food and to move or r est freely. For areas 
of low activity uptake, the SPECT scan may need to be increased. It is very important that the subject remain motionless for the duration of the 3D SPECT scan.  
The SPECT transverse slices will be reconstructed using the manufacturer’s  recommended 
reconstruction algorithms including the recommended attenuation correction. 
It is strongly recommended that each site should perform all imaging acquisitions per their 
camera manufacturer and model parameters and in accordance with their insti tutional practices 
for both the whole body scan, planar imaging,  as well as the SPECT and SPECT/CT imaging  
acquisitions.

8.6 Safety  
8.6.1  Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Definition of Adverse Event  
The definitions below follow International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) – Good Clinical Practice (GCP) (see also ICH Guideline for Clinical Safety Data Management:  Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting). 
Adverse Event (AE)  
An AE is defined as any untowar d medical occurrence in a subject administered a 
pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this 
treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal (investigational) product.  
Any clinically significant change in a condition (worsening) from screening that results in a 
change in subject management will be considered an AE and will be recorded on the AE page of the CRF. 
By [CONTACT_214976], all untoward medical occurrences beginning on the day of Visit 2 
Baseline (Day 1)  through the assessment  of Visit 3 Follow -up () are to be reported as AEs.  
AEs continuing after study completion will be followed to normalization or stabilization. Additionally, untoward medical events occurring prior to the day of Tc 99m tilmanocept  
administration will be collect an d added to the subject’s medical history unless  they are related 
to a study  procedure in which case the event will be recorded as an AE .    SAEs will be reported 
from the time of consent through the end of participation.

Confidential  Page 50 of 83 
 [IP_ADDRESS]  Categories for Adverse Event Assess ment  
All AEs will be assessed and documented by [CONTACT_8970].  
Seriousness  
For each AE, the seriousness must be determined according to the criteria given in Section  [IP_ADDRESS]. 
Severity  
The severity of an AE is classified according to the following categories, taking into account the possible range of the intensity of the event:  
• Mild  - The adverse event is transient and easily tolerated by [CONTACT_423].  
• Moderate -  The adverse event causes the subject discomfort and interrupts the 
subject’s usual activities  
• Severe -  The adverse event causes considerable interference with the subject’s  
usual activities and may be incapacitating or life -threatening.  
 
Specific drug treatment  
Any specific drug treatment will be documented.  
Causal relationship to investigational product 
The investigator will use the following definitions to assess the relationship of the adverse 
event to the use of investigational product:  
Definitely related:  Event can be fully explained by [CONTACT_779658]. 
Probably related:  Event is most likely to be explained by [CONTACT_214978]’s clinical state or other agents/therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
Possibly related:  Event may be explained by [CONTACT_214979]’s clinical state or other agents/therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. 
Probably not related: Event is most likely to be explained by [CONTACT_423]’s clinical state or other agents/therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], rather than the investigational product. 
Definitely not related:  Event can be fully explained by [CONTACT_423]’s clinical state or other agents/therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
For causality assessments, e vents meeting the categories of definitely, probably, or possibly 
related will be considered to be related to investigational product.

 Causal relationship to study procedure  
The investigator will use the following definitions to assess the relationship of the adverse 
event to study procedure :  
Definitely related:  Event can be fully explained by [CONTACT_161473].  
Probably related:  Event is most likely to be explained by [CONTACT_779659]’s clinical state or other agents/therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
Possibly related:  Event may be explained by [CONTACT_779660]’s 
clinical state or other agents/therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
Probably not related: Event is most likely to be explained by [CONTACT_423]’s clinical state or other agents/therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], rather than the study procedure. 
Definitely not related:  Event can be fully explained by [CONTACT_423]’s clinical state or other agents/therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
For causality assessments, events meeting the categories of definitely, probably, or possibly related will be considered to be relat ed to study.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Assessments and Documentation of Adverse Events  
Attention shall be paid to the occurrence of AEs for the duration of subject participation. Events occurring prior to Visit 2 (day of Tc 99m tilmanocept administration) will be recorded in the subject’s medical history . Untoward medical events  beginning on Visit 2 (day of Tc 99m 
tilmanocept administration)  through the completion of the Visit [ADDRESS_1071619] s should be closely observed by [CONTACT_779661].    
Any AE (observed, volunteered, or elicited) should be recorded in detail in the source documentation. 
The following information is required: 
• The date  and time of onset of any AE.  
• The duration (the entire duration of an event or symptom, calculated from date of 
onset to date of end, if not recorded directly). 
• The seriousness of the AE will be assessed by [CONTACT_093].  If the investigator deems that an AE qualifies as an SAE, a special form provided by [CONTACT_779662].  A definition of serious adverse events is provided in S ection [IP_ADDRESS].   
• The maximum intensity (mild, moderate, or severe). 
• Whether drug treatment was administered for the event, any specific drug treatment must be documented. 
Tc 99m tilmanocept   Navidea Biopharmaceuticals, Inc

Confidential  Page 52 of 83 
 • The relationship of the AE to the investigational product and to study conduct (for 
definitions, see above). 
The outcome  of the AE (resolved, resolved with sequelae, not resolved, unknown, 
death).  
 AEs will be coded according to an internationally recognized dictionary (Medical Dictionary 
for Regulatory Activities [MedDRA]).  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Expected Adverse Events  
Investigational Product- Related Risks  
In all completed studies of Lymphoseek, involving [ADDRESS_1071620] s, only three events (breast pain 
and injection site pain reported by [CONTACT_214983] a subj ect with head and neck squamous cell cancer ) were deemed definitely related 
to the administration of Lymphoseek by [CONTACT_093]. The most common adverse reactions (incident <1%) have been 
lack of effect (<0.067%), injection site pain (<0.02%) and rash 
(<0.02%) . Adverse events from the radioactive dose are not expected, since the applied 
radiation doses are far below doses that can cause acute effects in human tissues.  
In addition to the Lymphoseek pre -approval clinical studies, post -marketing surveilla nce 
shows that Lymphoseek has been administered to more than 180,000  patients with not a single 
drug- related SAE.  Routes of administration include d: subcutaneous, intradermal , and 
peritumoral. The intended route of administration in this study is intravenous.   
Precautionary Measures  
Special precautionary measures are not considered necessary for this study.  In case of 
emergency, standard emergency procedures will be employed.  
Unexpected Adverse Events  
An unexpected adverse event is defined as an adverse reaction that in nature and severity is not consistent with the applicable product information (e.g., Investigator’s Brochure).  Any 
adverse experience that is not listed in the current Investigator’s Brochure or which is, with regard to the specif icity or severity, not consistent with the risk information shall be regarded 
as unexpected.   
Examples would be (a) acute renal failure listed in the Investigator’s Brochure with a subsequent new report of interstitial nephritis and (b) hepatitis with a first report of fulminant hepatitis.  “Unexpected” as used in this definition refers to an adverse drug experience that has not been previously observed and included in the Investigator’s Brochure, rather than from the perspective of such experience not bein g anticipated from the pharmacological properties of 
the investigational product.

 [IP_ADDRESS]  Serious Adverse Events  
Definition of Serious Adverse Events  
Definition  
The following SAE definition is based on ICH guidelines and the final rule issued by [CONTACT_86959] (FDA) and effective [ADDRESS_1071621] medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• results in death, or 
• is life threatening, or  
• requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], or 
• results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or  
• is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or 
• is an important medical event (see paragraphs below).  
 
The term ‘life threatening’ in the definition refers to an event in which the subject was at risk  
of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have 
caused death if it were more severe.  
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether it is appropriate to report an AE as serious also in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately life threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_779622] n 
above.  These should also usually be considered serious.  Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm or blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in subject hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. 
Actions and reporting obligations in case of serious adverse events The investigator should take appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic measures to minimize the 
risk to the subject.   
If any SAE occurs over the course of the study, investigators or other site personnel will inform 
Navidea Biopharmaceutical representatives within one day (i.e., within 24 hours) of becoming aware of the SAE. Written notification of the SAE will be emailed  to Navidea 
Biopharmaceuticals Pharmacovigilance at  [EMAIL_4182] . For fata l or life -threatening 
adverse events where important or relevant information is missing, active follow -up is 
undertaken immediately.  
Pregnancy will have the same time reporting obligations to the sponsor as SAEs. Upon notification, Navidea will provide a form for collection of pregnancy information. 
All SAEs must also be recorded on the Adverse Event e CRFs.

 Notification of the IRB(s) 
The sponsor and/or the inve stigator will notify the IRB(s)  about all relevant events (e.g., 
serious adverse events [SAEs] and Suspected, Unexpected, Serious Adverse Reactions 
[S[LOCATION_003]Rs]) according to all applicable regulations. Notification of the authorities The sponsor will process and report all relevant events (e.g., SAEs, S[LOCATION_003]Rs) to the authorities

8.6.2  Further Safety Assessments  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Physical Exam  
Complete  physical examinations will be conducted according to the Schedule of Study Events 
(see Appendix 1).  Height and body weight will be collected at Vis it 1 (Screening). Only body 
weight will be repeating at the Visit 3 (Follow -Up). 
Physical examinations will be performed for the following body systems: 
• General Appearance  
• Skin/dermatological  
• Eyes, ears, nose, throat 
• Head and neck (including thyroid) 
• Lungs  
• Heart  
• Abdomen (liver, kidney, spleen, gastrointestinal) 
• Lymph nodes 
• Musculoskeletal  
• Nervous system 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Vital Signs  
Vital signs comprise the measurement of  body temperature, heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], systolic and 
diastolic blood pressure. All measurements will be taken after the subject has been in a resting 
position for at least [ADDRESS_1071622] injection, and at the follow-up safety visit.

 Any clinically significant change from screening (worsening) that results in a change in subject 
management will be considered an AE and will be recorded on the AE page of the CRF. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Electrocardiogram  
A standard 12- lead electrocardiogram (ECG) will be obtained at screening, as well as [ADDRESS_1071623] 1 m inute. No continuous ECG monitoring will be required.  At 
a minimum the heart rate, QRS, PR and QT intervals will be collected.  QTc will be calculated using both the Fridericia and Bazett formulas. 
On-site investigator’s responsibilities  
The immediate car diac safety of the subject will be ensured by [CONTACT_21639]- site qualified physician.  
Any 12-lead ECG intervals, waveform abnormalities, and rhythm changes that are clinically 
significant in that they result in a change in subject management will be considered a n AE.  In 
the case of an SAE, once SAE notification is decided upon, investigators are required to follow 
the procedure described for SAE notification and document abnormal ECG findings (intervals and waveforms).  Any interval data or abnormal waveform fin ding that resulted in an AE (i.e., 
change of patient management) must be followed to normalization or stabilization .  
Each 12-lead ECG tracing must be signed and dated and stored in the subject’s source 
documentation.   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Clinical Laboratory Parameters for Screening and Safety  
Clinical laboratory tests to be evaluated in this study include hematology , serum chemistry, 
and urinalysis.  Clinical laboratory tests will include the following  as defined in  Table 2.

9.3 Efficacy Variables  
The efficacy variables for this study are as follows:  
• Nuclear medicine specialist qualitative determination of presence/absence of radiotracer uptake (i.e., Tc 99m tilmanocept localization positive/negative ) relative to background 
from SPECT imaging results for each  DAS28  joint location for each subject (deemed the 
“gold standard” result, [ADDRESS_1071627]) 
• Clinically identified presence/absence of RA using the DAS28 instrument ([ADDRESS_1071628]) 
• Quantitative planar imaging intensity of radiotracer uptake for each joint location 
 
A location/joint would be considered clinically identified as RA positive if it is either swollen 
or tender as measured by [CONTACT_311972]28 instrument.  The presence of radio tracer upt ake relative 
to background as determined by [CONTACT_779663] a location would indicate 
the location is RA positive.  
The efficacy endpoints for this study are as follows: 
• Per subject localization rate of Tc 99m tilmanocept by [CONTACT_779630]  
• Per joint location clinically RA -identified joint localization rate of Tc 99m 
tilmanocept by [CONTACT_779664] 99m tilmanocept   Navidea Biopharmaceuticals, Inc

 • Concordance of Tc 99m localization with anatomical areas of active RA defined by 
[CONTACT_779631].   
• Localization intensity for each clinically RA -defined joint (as determined by 
[CONTACT_779665])  
• Per subj ect localization rate of Tc 99m tilmanocept in areas other than RA -positive 
joints by [CONTACT_779630]  
• The following PK parameters will be calculated  for each subject , whenever possible, 
using Tc 99m tilmanocept total radioactivity in whole blood and urine : maximum 
observed concentration (C max), time to C max (tmax), area under the concentration- time 
curve (AUC) from Hour [ADDRESS_1071629] measureable concentration (AUC 0-t), AUC 
extrapolated to infinity (AUC 0-∞), apparent terminal elimination rate constant ( λZ), 
and apparent terminal elimination half -life (t 1/2).   
• Radiation dosimetry of Tc 99m tilmanocept will include  radiation doses per organ 
(μGy/MBq), organs  receiving the highest organ dose (HT), effective doses per organ 
(μSv/MBq), mean effective dose  (μSv/MB q), effective dose resulting from a 
diagnostic dose  ± 20%. Dosimetry will be based on  target organ  image counts and 
modeling per OLINDA/EXM® 2.[ADDRESS_1071630] divided by [CONTACT_14458].

 9.5.5  Handling Missing Values  
The analysis of the primary efficacy variables will be carried out on the observed data, i.e., a 
complete case analysis.  For a specific location/joint, the patient must have data for the both the SPECT response value and the clinical evaluation of RA in order to be used i n the statistical 
analysis.

are to be entered onto the electronic CRFs (provided by [CONTACT_456]) as soon as possible. 
10.1.1  CRF Design  
Electronic CRFs (eCRFs) will be used for collecting all data generated during the trial. CRF 
completion details will be documented in a separate document that will be provided by [CONTACT_779672]. 
10.2 Monitoring 
This study will be monitored regularly by a clinical research associate (CRA) from the sponsor or a contract research organization (CRO).  Monitoring procedures include one or more visits designed to clarify all prerequisites before the study starts.  Interim monitoring visits will take 
place on a regular basis according to a schedule fixed by [CONTACT_11402].  During these visits, the CRA will check for completion of the entries on the CRFs, their compliance with 
the protocol and with GCP, and will compare the CRF entries with the source data. 
All data recorded in the CRF will be captured in the source documentation. The CRA will verify the correct use of the investigational product.  The investigational product 
will not be supplied to the investigator site prior to a favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_779623], if appropriate, from the radiation protection authorities. In 
addition, the CRA will determine whether all AEs and SAEs have been appropriately reported (including adherence to the time periods required for SAEs). 
10.3 Data Processing 
Study data documentation will be maintained specifying all relevant aspects of data processing for the study (including data validation, cleaning, correcting, releasing).  This documentation will be stored in the TMF.  
For data coding (e.g., AEs, medication, medical/surgical history), internationally recognized and accepted dictionaries will be used.  These and the processes used for coding will be specified in the data management plan.  
10.4 Auditing 
A member of the sponsor’s (or a designated CRO) quality assurance unit may arrange to visit the investigator in order to audit the performance of the study at the study site and the study documents originating there.  The auditor(s) will usually be accompanied by a CRA or the 
study team lead er.  The investigator will be informed about the outcome of the audit.

are readily available upon authorities’ request.  Patient (hospit al) files will be archived 
according to local regulations and in accordance with the maximum period of time permitted by [CONTACT_5035][INVESTIGATOR_307], institution, or private practice.  Where the archiving procedures do not meet the minimum timelines required by [CONTACT_212934], alternative arrangements must be made to 
ensure the availability of the source documents for the required period. 
The investigator/institution notifies the sponsor if the archival arrangements change 
(e.g.,  relocation or transfer of ownership). 
The investigator site file is not to be destroyed without the sponsor’s approval. 
The investigator’s contract will contain all regulations relevant for the study center.  
10.6 Premature Termination of the Study 
Termination by [CONTACT_214990]: 
1. Failure to enroll subjects  
2. Protocol violations 
3. Inaccurate or incomplete data  
4. Unsafe or unethical practices  
5. Questionable safety of the investigational product 
6. Suspected lack of efficacy of the investigation al product 
7. Administrative decision  
 
Termination by [CONTACT_779673], the Investigator must do the following:  
• Return all unused investigational products and related study materials to the Sponsor. 
• Provide the IRB(s)  and the sponsor with a written statement describing why the study 
was terminated prematurely.  Prompt compliance with this requirement is essential so 
that the sponsor may comply with its regulatory obligations.

 10.6.1  Study as a Whole  
The sponsor re tains the right to prematurely terminate the study as a whole at any time.   
At the discretion of the sponsor, the entire study may be canceled for medical reasons.  In 
addition, the sponsor retains the right to end the study at any time if the study cannot be carried out as agreed upon in the protocol. I n case of early termination or suspension of the study, the 
principal investigator/sponsor will promptly inform the investigator/institutions, regulatory authorities, and IRB of the termination or suspension and the reason for that. 
10.6.2  Center  
At any time, the study may be terminated at an individual center if:  
• The center cannot comply with the requirements of the protocol. 
• It is not possible for the center to comply with GCP standards. 
 
10.6.3  Study Participant  
Individual subjects may be withdrawn from the study according to the criteria specified in

additionally as required by [CONTACT_093]’s institution in an integrated subject information and consent sheet. A sample informed consent form (ICF) is provided as a document separate to this  protocol. 
Based on this subject ICF, the investigator will explain all relevant aspects of the study to each subject, before entry into the study (i.e., before examinations and procedures associated with selection for the study are performed).  
The invest igator will also mention that written approval of the IRB  has been obtained.  Each 
subject will have ample time and opportunity to ask questions and will be informed about the 
right to withdraw from the study at any time without any disadvantage and withou t having to 
provide reasons for this decision.  Following this informative discussion, the subject will be 
asked if he/she is willing to sign and personally date a statement of informed consent.  Only if 
the subject voluntarily agrees to sign the ICF and has done so, may he/she enter the study.  
Additionally, the investigator or his/her designee will personally sign and date the form.  The 
subject will receive a duplicate of the signed and dated form.  
The investigator will record in the source documentation the consent process including the time and date of obtaining informed consent. In the event that informed consent is obtained on 
the date that baseline study procedures are performed, the study record or subject's clinical record must clearly show that informed consent was obtained prior to these procedures.
  
The ICF and any other written information provided to subjects will be revised whenever important new information becomes available that may be relevant to the subject’s consent, or there is an amend ment to the protocol which necessitates a change to the content of the subject 
information and/or the written ICF. The investigator will inform the subject of changes in a timely manner and will ask the subject to confirm his/her participation in the study  by [CONTACT_779674] 99m tilmanocept   Navidea Biopharmaceuticals, Inc

 Appendix 4  2010 ACR/ EULAR Classification Criteria 
 Score  
Target population (Who should be tested?): Patients who   
1) Have at least 1 joint with definite clinical synovitis (swelling)*   
2) With the synovitis not better explained by [CONTACT_51089]†   
Classification criteria for RA (score -based algorithm: add score of categories A -D;  
             a score of ≥ 6/10 is needed for classification of a patient as having definite 
RA)‡   
A. Joint inv olvement§   
1 large joint  0 
2 – 10 large joints  1 
1 – 3 small join ts (with or without involvement of large joints)#  2 
4- 10 small joints (with or without involvement of large joints)  3 
> 10 joints (at least 1 small joint)**  5 
B. Serology (at least [ADDRESS_1071665]  result is needed for classification)‡‡   
Negative RF and negative ACPA  0 
Low-positive RF or low-positive ACPA  2 
High -positive RF or high-positive ACPA  3 
C. Acute -phase reactants (at least [ADDRESS_1071666] result is needed for classification) ‡‡   
Normal CRP and normal ESR  0 
Abnormal CRP or abnormal ESR  1 
D. Duration of symptoms§§   
< 6 weeks  0 
≥ 6 weeks  1 
* The criteria are aimed at classification of newly presenting patients. In addition, patients 
with erosive disease typi[INVESTIGATOR_50983] (RA) with a history compatible with prior fulfillment of the 2010 criteria should be classified as having RA. Patients with longstanding disease, including those whose disease is inactive (with or without treatment) who, based on retrospectively available data, have previously fulfilled the 2010 criteria should be classified as having RA.  
† Differential  diagnoses vary among  patients  with  different  presentations, but may include 
conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus, psoriatic arthritis, and gout. If it is unclear 
about the relevant differential diagnoses to consider, an expert rheumatologist should be consulted.  
‡ Although patients with a score of < 6/10 are not classifiable as having RA, their status can 
be reassessed and the criteria might be fulfilled cumulatively over time.  
§ Joint involvement refers to any swollen or tender joint on examination, which may be confirmed by [CONTACT_167194]. Distal interphalangeal joints, first carpometacarpal joints, and first metatarsophalangeal joints are excluded from assessment. 
Tc 99m tilmanocept   Navidea Biopharmaceuticals, Inc 
Clinical Study Protocol Number: NAV3 -21  Date: [ADDRESS_1071667] category possible based on the pattern of 
joint involvement.  
“Large joints” refers to shoulders, elbows, hips, knees, and ankles.  # “Small joints” refers to the metacarpophalangeal joints, proximal interphalangeal joints, 
second through fifth metatarsophalangeal joints, thumb interphalangeal joints, and wrists.  
** In this category, at least [ADDRESS_1071668] be a small joint; the other joints can 
include any combination of large and additional small joints, as well as other joints not 
specifically listed elsewhere (e.g., temporomandibular, acromioclavicular, sternoclavicular, etc.).  
†† Negative refers to IU values that are less than or equal to the upper limit of normal (ULN) for the laboratory and assay; low-positive refers to IU values that are higher than the ULN but ≤ 3times the ULN for the laboratory and assay; high- positive refers to IU values that are 
> [ADDRESS_1071669] for the laboratory and assay. Where rheumatoid factor (RF) information is only available as positive or negative, a positive result should be scored as low-positive for RF. ACPA = anti -citrullinated protein antibody.  
‡‡ Normal/abnormal is determined by [CONTACT_51091]. CRP = C- reactive protein; 
ESR = erythrocyte sedimentation rate.  
§§ Duration of symptoms refers to patient self-report of the duration of signs or symptoms of synovitis (e.g., pain, swelling, tenderness) of joints that are clinically involved at the time of assessment, regardless of treatment status.

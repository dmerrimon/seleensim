Title of Study:  A Phase 3, Multi -Center, Randomized, Double -Blind, Vehicle -Controlled, 2 Arm, Parallel 
Group Study Comparing  the Safety and Efficacy of IDP -123 Lotion and IDP-123 Vehicle Lotion  in the 
Treatment of Acne Vulgaris  
Number of clinical centers:  Multicenter, approximately [32-50 ] investigational centers in North 
America  
Objective :  
The primary objective of this study is to compare the safety, efficacy , and tolerability of IDP -123 Lotion 
and IDP-123 Vehicle Lotion, in the treat ment of subjects with moderate to severe acne vulgaris . 
Methodology:  
This is a multi -center, randomized, double- blind, vehicle -controlled, [ADDRESS_264404] a clinical diagnosis of 
moderate to severe acne (defined as an EGSS score of 3 or 4), presenting with 20 -50 inflammatory facial 
lesions (pa pules, pustules, and nodules), 25-100 non -inflammatory facial lesions (open and closed 
comedones), and < 2 facial nodules.  
Approximately 800 subjects will be randomized  to the following treatment groups:  
• 400 Subjects to IDP -123 Lotion, once -daily application 
• [ADDRESS_264405] -baseline study visit (We eks 2, 
4, 8, and 12). Subjects will apply their treatments at home, once daily  in the evening, as instructed by [CONTACT_220126]  (with the exception of study visit days, where 
study drug will be applied by [CONTACT_3433] e subject on-site during study visit) .  
The investigator will assess the subject’s face at each study visit. Information on reported and observed AEs will be obtained at each visit. An abbreviated physical exam and vital signs measurement will be performed  at Baseline and Week 12  (Final Visit)  visits for all subjects. Blood samples will be collected 
from subjects at Baseline and  Week 12, for CBC/Diff, serum chemistry, and serum pregnancy (for 
females of childbearing potential) . For all pre-menses females an d female subjects of childbearing 
potential (FOCBP), urine pregnancy testing will be performed at Screening, Baseline prior to 
randomization, and at Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12. All subjects will be asked to complete the Acne- Specific 
Quality of Life (Acne -QoL)  at Baseline and Week 12 . In addition, at selected sites, standardized 
photography of the face will be performed at Baseline and Weeks 2, 4, 8 , and 12.  
Number of subjects planned:  
Approximately [ADDRESS_264406] s will be randomized  to the following treatment groups : 
• 400 Subjects to IDP -123 Lotion , once -daily application  
• 400 Subjects to IDP-123 Vehicle Lotion , once -daily application

 Efficacy Measurements:  
Lesion Counts  
At each visit the Evaluator will count the total number of inflammatory lesions (papules, pustules, and 
nodules) on the subject’s face. Nodules will be counted separately but will be included in the total inflammatory lesion count. At baseline, eligible su bjects may have no more than two nodules. Nodules 
will be included in the statistical analysis of inflammatory lesion counts. All inflammatory lesions will be counted at the same time rather than counting papules and pustules separately. The Evaluator will  also 
count the total number of non- inflammatory lesions (open and closed comedones).  The same blinded 
evaluator should perform the lesion counts and EGSS evaluations at all visits from baseline to Week [ADDRESS_264415] . 
Inflammatory lesions  are defined as follows:  
Papule – a small, solid elevation less than [ADDRESS_264416] of the lesion is above the surface of the 
skin.  
Pustule – a small, circumscribed elevation less than 5 mm in diameter that contains yellow -white exudate.  
Nodule – a subcu taneous lesion greater than or equal to 5 mm in diameter  
Non-inflammatory lesions  are defined as follows:  
Open comedones (black head)  - a lesion in which the follicle opening is widely dilated with the contents 
protruding out onto the surface of the skin.  
Closed comedones (white head) – a lesion in which  the follicle opening is closed, but the sebaceous gland 
is enlarged by [CONTACT_220128], which in turn causes the skin around the follicle to thin 
and become elevated with a white appearance.  
Evaluator’s Global Severity Score (EGSS)  
At each visit the severity will be determined based on evaluator -blinded evaluations of the signs and 
symptoms of acne vulgaris. Evaluations will be scored on a scale of [ADDRESS_264417] clear  Rare non -inflammatory lesions present, with rare non -inflamed papules (papules must 
be resolving  and may be hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_49194], though not pi[INVESTIGATOR_8745] -red)  
2  
Mild  Some non -inflammatory lesions are present, with few inflammatory lesions 
(papules/pustules only; no nodulo -cystic lesions)  
3  
Moderate  Non-inflammatory lesions predominate, with multiple inflammatory lesions evident: 
several to many comedones and papules/pustules, and there may or may not be one 
nodulo -cystic lesion  
4  
Severe  Inflammatory lesions are more apparent, many comedones and papules/pustules, there 
may or may not be up to 2 nodulo -cystic lesions  
 
Safety Assessments: 
Cutaneous safety and tolerability will be evaluated by [CONTACT_220129] (scaling, erythema,  hypo/hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_371],  itching, burning, and 
stinging) to be assessed at each study visit. Itching, burning and stinging (Cutaneous tolerability) will be reviewed with the subject at each study visit as an average over the period since the previous visit. Scaling , erythema and hypo/hyper -pi[INVESTIGATOR_371] (Cutaneous Safety) will be assessed by [CONTACT_85170]. Cutaneous tolerability signs and symptoms that result in the subject requiring a concomitant therapy, interruption of treatment, or discontinuation from the study w ill be reported as an AE .  
 
At selected sites, standardized photography of the face will be performed.

 Statistical methods:  
All statistical processing will be performed using SAS® version 9.3 or later unless otherwise stated.  
Statistical significance will be based on two -tailed tests of the null hypothesis resulting in p -values of 0.05 
or less. Tests of lesion count superiority will be based on an ANCOVA with factors of treatment and 
analysis center and the respective Baseline lesion count as a covariate or on ranked data submitted to an 
ANCOVA with factors of treatment and analysis center and the respective Baseline lesion count as a 
covariate. The co -primary analysis of the dicho tomized EGSS will be based on logistic regression with 
factors of treatment group and analysis center.  The primary method of handling missing efficacy data will 
be based on estimation using the method of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC ) imputation.  
Additionally, a model -based multiple imputation process will be used as a sensitivity analysis to the 
MCMC imputation. Finally, the absolute change in lesion count will be analyzed using a repeated 
measures ANCOVA for lesion count data or a repeated measures logistic regression model (generalized 
estimating equations) for the dichotomized EGSS.     
Inflammatory and non -inflammatory lesion counts will be recorded for each Subject at Baseline and at 
Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12. The absolute and perce nt change from Baseline in inflammatory and non -
inflammatory lesions will be derived for each Subject at Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12.  
The EGSS will be recorded for each Subject. The EGSS will be dichotomized into “success” and “failure” 
with a Subject considered a success if the Evaluator’s Global Severity Score at Week 2, 4, 8, and [ADDRESS_264419] Clear .  
Populations Analyzed: 
An intent -to-treat (ITT) analysis will be conducted on all study subj ects. The ITT popula tion will consist 
of all randomized subjects who were dispensed  study medication.  
The safety population will be comprised of all randomized subjects who are presumed to have used the 
study medication at least once and who provide at least one post -baseline safety evaluation. A per -
protocol (PP) analysis will also be conducted. Subjects will be eligible for the PP analysis if they complete 
the 12 -week evaluation without noteworthy study protocol violations (i.e., any Subject or investigator 
activity that could have possibly interfered with the therapeutic administration of the treatment or the precise evaluation of treatment efficacy). The PP population will include subjects in the safety population 
who do not meet any of the following criteria : 
• Failed any of  the inclusion/exclusion criteria;  
• Have taken any interfering concomitant medications;  
• Did not attend the Week 12 visit; 
• Missed more than [ADDRESS_264420] baseline study visit prior to Week 12  
• Have not been compliant with the dosing regimen (i.e., Subjects may not miss more than 
five consecutive days of dosing and must take 80- 120% of expected doses. The number of 
expected doses will be determined for each subject based on the length of their 
participation in the study) ; 
• Out of visit window  at the [ADDRESS_264421] of 
the trial that result in noteworthy study protocol violations.  
Approximately 800 subjects with moderate or severe acne will be  enrolled and randomized to  the 
following treatment groups:  
• 400 su bjects to receive IDP-123 Lotion, once -daily application  
• [ADDRESS_264422] demographic and baseline characteristics will be summarized by [CONTACT_220130],  PP, and safety analysis sets.

 Efficacy  Evaluation : 
Primary efficacy  analyses will be conducted on the ITT (primary) and PP (supportive) populations.   
Secondary and supportive analyses will be conducted on the ITT population.   
Primary:  
Co-primary efficacy analyses include  the absolute change  from baseline  in inflammatory and in non -
inflammatory lesions, and the dichotomized Evaluator’s Global Severity Score.  The pre -specified time 
point will be Week 12. All of the testing relating to th e analysis of inflammatory and non -inflammatory 
lesions will use the methods introduced in Section 1 2. 
Secondary:  
Secondary efficacy endpoints include  percent change in inflammatory and non -inflammatory lesion 
counts from baseline  to Week s 12, [ADDRESS_264424] a two grade  
improvement in the Evaluator’s Global Severity Score from baseline to Week 12 .  
Supportive:  
Additional supportive efficacy endpoints includ e percent change in inflammatory and non -inflammatory 
lesions counts from baseline at Week 2, as well as proportion of subjects with at least a two grade 
improvement in the Evaluator’s Global Severity Score from baseline at Weeks 2, 4, and 8. 
Safety Evaluati on: 
All subjects who receive medication and provide at least one post -baseline safety evaluation will 
constitute the safety population . Safety will be evaluated by [CONTACT_220131] (AEs), 
Cutaneous Tolerability Evaluations, vital signs/abbreviated physical exams, and safety labs .  
Cutaneous Safety Evaluation scores (erythema, scaling , and hypo/hyper -pi[INVESTIGATOR_371] ) and Tolerability 
(itching, burning, and stinging) will be presented with descriptive statistics at Baseline and at Weeks 2, 4, 
8, and  12 for each treatment group. Frequencies and percentages for each outcome category will be 
included in these statistics. Mean values will be presented graphically by [CONTACT_85223].  
Vital signs and an abbreviated physical exam, and safety labs will be conducted on all subjects at specified 
visits. For pre-menses females and females of child -bearing potential (FOCBP), urine pregnancy testing 
and serum pregnancy testing will occur at specified visits. Changes from baseline in safety laboratory values and vital sign measurements will be summarized with descriptive statistics for each treatment group at all applicable study visits. Shift tables will be presented for changes in safety laboratory values to 
summaries laboratory test results collected at Baseline  and Week  [ADDRESS_264425] relationship within each category .

 Comparisons among treatment groups will be made by [CONTACT_220132] (classified into MedDRA terms) during the study.  The Fisher’s Exact test will be used to 
compare the proportion of subjects in each treatment group who report any a dverse event at a significance 
level of 0.05.  The specific system organ classes and preferred terms analyzed will be those that are 
reported by [CONTACT_220133].  
All information pertaining to AEs noted during the  study will be listed by [CONTACT_1130], detailing verbatim 
given by [CONTACT_093], preferred term, system organ class, start date, stop date, severity, actions taken, 
and drug relatedness. The AE onset will also be shown relative (in number of days) to the day of initial dose of the randomized study medication.  
Serious adverse events (SAEs) will be tabulated by [CONTACT_85177].  
In addition, a list of subjects who discontinued from the study and a list of subjects who experienced 
SAEs will also be provided.  
Subject Self -Assessment  
Subjects will be asked to complete the Acne -Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire  during the study .    
Inferential statistical analysis will not be performed on the questionnaire; the subjective responses will be 
compared between treatment groups for trends.  
 
 
 
This study will be performed in compliance with GCP including the archiving of essential study 
documents. This protocol follows guidelines outlined by [CONTACT_8639] 
(ICH). Al l data furnished to the investigator and his/her staff, and all data obtained through this stud y, will

 5 Introduction  
Acne is a very common disorder of sebaceous follicles that usually begins at the time of the 
sharp increase in androgen production occurring in adolescence [ 1]. The disease is most 
prevalent amongst teenagers, but it does occur later in life, particularly in the third and fourth decade. The pathogenesis is complex and involves an androgen- stimulated increase in sebum 
production, associated with follicular hyperkeratinization and obstruction of the sebaceous follicles. This results in abnormal desquamation of the follicular epi[INVESTIGATOR_2130], and is associated 
with bacterial proliferation (especially Propi[INVESTIGATOR_76494] (P. acnes) ) and chronic 
inflammation associated with acne. These changes in acne subjects result in enlarged sebaceous glands; obstruction of the follicular canal with associated sebum retention and distention of the follicle by [CONTACT_220134] (popularly known as “blackheads” or “whiteheads”); and more deeply located papules, nodules and cysts [ 1]. The 
areas most affected by [CONTACT_220135][INVESTIGATOR_85134], where the sebaceous glands are particularly active [2]. 
Currently, therapeutic treatment of acne is directed against [ADDRESS_264438] the colonization of bacteria ( P. acnes ) in follicles has 
made use of anti -infectives such as topi[INVESTIGATOR_85164] (2.5%-10%), clindamycin, and 
erythromycin and systemic tetracyclines; however, known disadvantages to this treatment modality include irritation and limited use due to pathogen resistance [ 2-5]. Effective 
treatment directed towards inhibiting sebaceous gland activity has included oral corticosteroids, spi[INVESTIGATOR_8407], and isotretinoin in addition to anti- androgens 
(eg, cypro terone acetate). Known disadvantages to this treatment modality include being 
limited to use in females (anti-androgens), and limited to short term use for safety (oral corticosteroids). Finally, effective treatment directed against intrafollicular hyperco rnification has made use of retinoids such as oral isotretinoin and topi[INVESTIGATOR_220105], inhibiting follicular hyperkeratinization and follicular obstruction [ 6]. In general, the known usefulness of oral 
retinoids (ie, oral isotretinoin) is limited by [CONTACT_220136], which range from relatively minor effects (e .g., dryness of mucosa and skin, skin irritation, and skin scaling) to major 
toxicity syndromes (reversible hair loss, bone toxicity and teratogenicity) and may include 
varying degrees of symptoms associated with hypervitaminosis A syndrome [ 2, 7, 8]. 
Likewise, the efficacy of  topi[INVESTIGATOR_220106], which include significant erythema, dryness, peeling, scaling, and irritation [9].

 Tazarotene is a retinoid prodrug that activates 3 members of the retinoid acid receptor (RAR) 
nuclear receptors (RARα, RARβ, and RARγ), which act to modify gene expression, subsequent protein synthesis, and epi[INVESTIGATOR_220107]. Tazarotene shows a relative 
selectivity for RARβ, and RARγ. It has not been established, however, whether the clinical 
effects of tazarotene are mediated through activation of RARs, other mechanisms, or both. Although the mechanism of action for tazarotene in the treatment of acne is unknown, the drug’s antihyperproliferative, normalizing-of-differentiation, and anti- inflammatory effects may be 
related to the observed efficacy.  
IDP-123 is a lotion containing 0.045% tazarotene for the topi[INVESTIGATOR_112929]. This 
proposed product is the first lotion formulation developed for tazarotene and will be 
evaluated for safety and effectiveness in treating acne vulgaris.  
6 Study Objectives and Purpose   
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety, efficacy , and tolerability of a 
once- daily topi[INVESTIGATOR_220108] -123 Lotion compared to the IDP-123 Vehicle Lotion  in 
subjects with moderate to severe acne vulgaris  (a score of 3 or 4 [moderate to severe] on the 
Evaluator’s Global Severity Score ( EGSS ) scale) . 
7 Investigational plan  
7.1 Overall Study Design and Plan: D escription  
This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled study designed to assess 
the safety , efficacy , and tolerability of IDP -[ADDRESS_264440] a clinical diagnosis of moderate to severe acne vulgaris (a score of 3 or 4 [moderate to 
severe] on the EGSS scale).  
Approximately 800 subjects will be enrolled into this study and randomized into one (1) of two ( 2) treatment groups : 
• 400 subjects in the IDP-123 Lotion, once- daily application  group 
• 400 subjects in the IDP-123 Vehicle Lotion, once- daily application  group 
Subjects will be enrolled at approximately 32-50 independent study centers. The duration of 
treatme nt will be 12 weeks. Subjects will be evaluated at Screening, Baseline and at 
subsequent follow-up visits (Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12). 
An interactive web based response system (IWR S) will be employed to facilitate 
randomization of study subjects.  Treatment ass ignments and study drug kit numbers will be 
generated centrally by [CONTACT_220137] S. At each clinical site, subject numbers will be assigned 
consecutively at the screening visit starting with 001.

 The assigned study drug will be applied topi[INVESTIGATOR_85141] , in the 
evening , for 12 weeks (up to the evening prior to W eek 12 visit) with the exception of study 
visit days (Baseline, Weeks 2, 4 and 8) where study drug will be applied (also by [CONTACT_423]) 
after the study visit is completed  at the investigational center.  The initial application will be 
applied at the investigational center as per instruction from the study coordinator or designee. The subjects  will be instructed to avoid exposure to direct sunlight to prevent sunburn and 
should be instructed to use sunscreens of at least SPF 15 and wear protective clothing ( e.g., 
hat). During post-baseline study visits (Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12) the subjects will be asked to 
return their used tubes of study drug and will be dispensed new tubes of study drug (only at 
Weeks 4 and 8; Week [ADDRESS_264442] no new study drug dispensed, and Week 12 will be final visit) . During the study, each subject will only be permitted to use approved non- medicated 
cleansers , moisturizers  and sunscreens . 
Subjects will b e asked to complete the Acne- Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire (Acne-
QoL, Appendix 17.3).  The Acne-Qo L will be completed at baseline and Week 12.  
Inferential statistical analysis will not be performed on the questionnaire; the subjective responses will be compared between treatment groups for trends. 
The EGSS should be completed prior to the lesion counts. Information on reported and observed adverse events (AEs) will be obtained at each visit. An 
abbreviated physical examination and vital sign meas urements will be performed at Baseline  
and Week 12 Visits (final visit) for all subjects.  
For all pre-menses females and female subjects of childbearing potential, urine pregnancy 
testing will be performed at Screening and confirmed at Baseline prior to randomization, and 
at Weeks 2, 4, 8 and 12. Serum pregnancy tests will also be conducted at Baseline and Week 
12 / early termination . 
Safety laboratory testing will be conducted at Baseline and Week 12 / early termination.  
Subjects who terminate study participation early will be asked to complete all Week 12 
assessments, as appropriate. Subjects who discontinue from the study during the treatment period will not be replaced. 
A “Re-screened ” subject (e.g., subject that is rescreened beyond the allowed screening period 
window ) will be considered a new subject and will need to be re-consented, receive a new 
screening number, and be entered in I WRS  as a new subject. All screening assessment s for 
re-screened subjects will need to be completed.

9 Treatment  Plan  
9.1 Methods of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups  
This is a double-blinded study, in which the identity of the study drug will be unknown to investigator/evaluator and subjects, as well as all individuals closely associated with the study.  
Subjects will be randomized to 1 of the 2 treatment groups in a ratio of 1:1 (IDP -123 [t azarotene 
0.045% ] Lotion: IDP-123 Vehicle Lotion). Each screened subject will be assigned a unique [ADDRESS_264458] of the 3-digit investigational center/site  number (pre -assigned by [CONTACT_64772]/designee)  and the 3 digit 
chronological screening order number, starting with 001 (e.g., 101001, 101002). The study drug kit will be assigned to subjects based on a randomization code and kit will be dispensed to the subjects by [CONTACT_220141], Week 4 and Week 8 visits. A study drug log will d ocument 
the inventory and dispensing of study drug at each investigational center. 
9.2 Randomization and Blinding  
The study drugs will be packaged and labeled identically, and the study drug kits will be numbered sequentially and dispensed randomly via IWRS  to the subjects entering the study 
within each investigational center. Study drug supplies will be distributed to the investigational centers to maintain the randomization ratio within each investigational center.  
As a double-blinded study, the investigators, the site staff, the sponsor, and the clinical monitors will not be aware of the treatment assigned to the individual study subjects. Delegated staff 
Protocol V01- 123A -301, IDP -123           Valeant Research & Development  
 
Version 2, [ADDRESS_264459] all used and 
unused study drug tube s as scheduled.  
9.3 Unblinding  
The treatment assignments for all enrolled subjects will be unblinded only after the conclusion of the study. Specifically, the blind will be broken only after all data are verified, entered into the database, an d validated; subject evaluability assessments are performed and entered into the 
database; and the database is locked.  
In the case of a medical emergency, the investigator can break the blind for the subject involved 
preferably by [CONTACT_220142] (or 
designee) immediately. After confirmation, the investigator will be contact[CONTACT_85193] a sponsor representative or via IWRS. The i nvestigator will record th e code break 
in the subject’s source documents.

If the subject requires topi[INVESTIGATOR_85129] (e.g., chest or back), the investigator may prescribe a product that does not contain tazarotene and note in source documents and eCRF. 
In addition there is a mandatory wash out period and restrictions during the study for the 
following systemic drugs: Topi[INVESTIGATOR_220103] (including comedone removal strips) on 
the face 1 week  
Non-allowed moisturizers or sunscreens on the face 1 week

A deviation from the protocol is an unintended and/or unanticipated departure from the 
procedures and/or processes approved by [CONTACT_135785]/IEC and agreed to by [CONTACT_31691]. Deviations usually have an impact on individual subjects  or a small group of 
subjects  and do not involve inclusion/exclusion or primary endpoint criteria. 
A protocol violation occurs when there is non- adherence to the protocol that results in a 
signi ficant, additional risk to the subject , when the subject  or investigator has failed to adhere to 
significant protocol requirements (inclusion/exclusion criteria) and the subject  was enrolled 
without prior sponsor approval, or when there is non- adherence to  FDA regulations and/or ICH 
GCP guidelines. 
The investigator or designee must document and explain in the subjects’  source documentation 
any deviation from the approved protocol. The investigator may implement a deviation from, or 
a change of, the protocol to eliminate an immediate hazard to study subjects without prior 
IRB/IEC approval. As soon as possible after such an occurrence, the implemented deviation or change, the reasons for it, and any proposed protocol amendment(s) should be submitted to the IRB/IEC for review and approval, to the sponsor for agreement, and to the regulatory authorities, if required.

excursions permitted between 15°C to 30°C (59°F to 86°F) , and should not be refrigerated. All 
unused study drug will be sent back to the Sponsor or Sponsor designee upon study completion 
for documented disposal. 
10.1.3 Administrat ion 
The assigned study drug will be applied topi[INVESTIGATOR_220116] a day  at home, in the evening, 
for 12 weeks (up to the evening prior to W eek 12 visit) with the exception of study visit days 
(Baseline, Weeks 2, 4 , and 8) where study drug will be appl ied by [CONTACT_85199].  Study drug will be applied as a thin layer  (a dab the 
size of a large pea) that is gently rubbed in to the skin. Study drug  use will be limited to the face.  
The Investigat or and/or trained investigational center staff member will instruct the subject on 
the proper application procedure of the study drug to the treatment area at the Baseline visit (see 
Appendix 17.1). All subjects will be instructed to apply study drug at approximately the same 
time every day in the evening for 12 weeks (up to the evening of W eek 12 visit)  after cleansing. 
On study visit days ( Baseline , Weeks 2, 4, and 8) subjects should be instructed to wait until after 
their study visit is completed to apply study medication at the investigational site (note, this will 
affect evening application times on study visit days, which is acceptable . Subjects should not 
apply another dose of study drug in the evening on the study visit days) . No time interval 
between dosing and meals or any other activity is specified.  
Subjects will be instructed to gently wash their face with a Sponsor/Investigator approved, non-
medicated  cleanser and warm (not hot) water. After washing, the subjects will be asked to 
thoroughly rinse and gently pat their face dry. The subjects should use the tube to dispense a pea-
sized amount of study drug to their fingertip  and spread a thin layer of the study drug over the

32 entire face. This dose should be dotted on to 6 areas (chin, left cheek, right cheek, nose, left 
forehead, right forehead) on the face. After distributing the dose in this manner the subject should gently rub the lotion into the skin. This amount of drug should be sufficient to cover the entire face excluding the mouth, eyes, inside the nose, and lips. It is important for the subject to treat their entire face (excluding the mouth, eyes and lips) and they should be instructed NOT to treat only specific lesions. They should gently smooth the study drug over the face evenly. The study drug should become invisible almost immediately following application with gentle rubbing. If this does not happen, the Investigator should instruct the subject on the use of a smaller dosage. The subject should wash his/her hands after applying the investigational product to the face. 
The subjects will be instructed to continue using the same Sponsor/Investigator approved non-
medicated facial cleanser , moisturizer and sunscreen and not to change products during the 
study. At each visit, subjects are to be asked if they have changed their cleansing routine. Facial makeup may be applied according to the subject’s normal daily routine; however, subjects should be instructed not to wear make- up during study visits as it may interfere with the 
evaluator’s assessments. Subjects must also agree to use non -comedogenic makeup during the 
study if they use makeup. No other products should be used on the face. Subjects should be instructed to minimize sun exposure and to use Sponsor /Investigato r-approved, non- medicated 
sunscreens of at least SPF 15 and to wear protective clothing during the day ( e.g., hat). Subjects 
should also be instructed to not use study treatment on skin that may have become eczematous (on the face) during the course of the study.  
Subjects should be instructed to store the study drug at room temperature.  If a subject loses or 
misplaces the tube cap at any point during the study, subject should contact [CONTACT_220146] a replacement  tube.

the baseline score. The investigator will make the assessment without referring to the baseline value. Every effort should be made for the sam e evaluator to perform each study assessment for 
the same study subject, for consistency in evaluations.  
Subjects are eligible if they have acne with a global severity of a 3 (moderate) or a 4 (severe) on 
the EGSS at the Baseline visit. The following scores will be used to describe the severity grade 
and subsequent score:

42 11.3.3 Med ical History and Abbreviated Physical Examination 
A medical history will be taken at Screening , and confirmed and revised if needed, at Baseline. 
Medical histories having resolved two  or more years before Baseline need not be collected unless 
considered re levant by [CONTACT_093].  
An abbreviated physical examination including measurements of heigh t and weight , and vital 
signs (blood pressure, heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487], and oral temperature) wil l be performed at 
Baseline and Week 12 (end of treatment/study ). Any abnormal physical exam findings will be 
recorded . Note: Height measurement will only be performed at Baseline.

or out-of- range and clinically significant laboratory finding that has appeared or worsened during 
the course of the clinical trial, regardless of causal relationship to the study. The collection of non-serious AEs and serious adverse events (SAEs) will begin following the subject's completion of the consent process to participate in the study.

Version 2, [ADDRESS_264503] 2017  CONFIDENTIAL  
43 11.4.2 Documenting Adverse Experiences  
It is the responsibility of the investigator to document all AEs that occur during the course of the 
study. The AEs should be documented as a single medical diagnosis. When this is not possible, the AE should be documented in terms of signs and/or symptoms observed by [CONTACT_85208]. Each AE which appears to be independent of any prior event will be reported separately.  
All AEs occurring after the subject signs the i nformed consent through the last study visit must 
be reported, regardless of whether or not the AEs are considered drug-related. All AEs, whether in response to a query, observed by [CONTACT_3991], or reported spontaneously by [CONTACT_423], will b e recorded.  Any AEs deemed related to treatment reported or observed at the final 
study/treatment visit will be followed until stabilization or resolution (or up to 30 days after final study visit).  
At each visit during the study, the subject will be asses sed for the occurrence of new and ongoing 
AEs. Cutaneous tolerability signs and symptoms that result in the subject’s requiring a concomitant therapy , interruption of treatment, or discontinuation from the study will be reported 
as an AE. The following data will be collected on all AEs and recorded on the appropriate e CRF:  
• Event name (diagnosis preferred, if unknown, record the signs/symptoms) 
• Onset date and end date 
• Maximum intensity (severity)  
• Seriousness 
• Action taken regarding study drug 
• Corrective treat ment, if given 
• Outcome 
In addition, the investigator’s assessment of causality will be recorded. 
Vital sign abnormalities are to be recorded as AEs only if they are clinically significant (for 
example: are symptomatic, requiring corrective treatment, leading to discontinuation or fulfilling a seriousness criterion). 
11.4.[ADDRESS_264504] medical occurrence that at any 
dose: 
• Results in death

44 • Is immediately life threatening, (the term "life threatening" in the definition of 
"serious" refers to an event in which the subject is at risk of death at the time of the 
event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death i f it 
were more severe)  
• Requires in patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
(hospi[INVESTIGATOR_22215] a baseline condition is not considered an AE) 
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (perma nent or substantial 
disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions) 
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• Is a medically important event that may not be immediately life threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the above listed outcomes. Examples of such  
events include, but are not limited to, allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] . 
Note: A spontaneous abortion will be considered an SAE and must be reported per Reporting of SAEs under Section 11.4.6. 
11.4.4 Assessment of Severity  
The severity assigned to an AE should be determined by [CONTACT_85210]. The categories described below should be used to estimate the severity of AEs:  
• Mild: Transient or mild discomfort; no limitation in activity; no medical 
intervention/therapy required 
• Moderate: Mild to moderate limitation in activity; so me assistance may be needed; no 
or minimal medical intervention/therapy required  
• Severe: Marked limitation in activity; some assistance usually required; medical intervention/therapy required; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_220122]; may be incapacitating or life threatening  
11.4.5 Assessment of Causality  
The investigator should assess the relationship of the AE, if any, to the study drug as either “Related” or “Not Related”. The following should be taken into account when assessing AE/SAE causality:  
Related: There is at least a reasonable possibility that the AE/SAE is related to the study  drug. 
Reasonable possibility means that there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the AE /SAE . 
Protocol V01- 123A -301, IDP -123           Valeant Research & Development  
 
Version 2, [ADDRESS_264506] 2017  CONFIDENTIAL  
45 Not Related: There is little or no reasonable possibility that the AE/SAE is related to the  study 
drug. This assessment implies that the AE/SAE has little or no temporal relationship to the study 
drug and/or a more likely or certai n alternative etiology exists.  
11.4.6 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events  
Adverse events classified as “serious” require expeditious handling and reporting to sponsor or designee within [ADDRESS_264507] within 24 hours of the investigator’s awareness of the event. 
All SAEs must be reported via confirmed facsimile  or email  transmission and must be submitted 
on a written SAE report form signed by [CONTACT_19452] 24 hours of the investigator’s awareness of the event.  
The contact(s)  for reporting an SAE are: 
 
 
Inves
tigators should not wait to receive additional information to fully document the event 
before notifying the Medical Monitor  and Sponsor of an SAE. If only limited information is 
initially available, follow -up reports are required. Additional relevant information such as 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_220123]. Should the investigator become aware of an SAE (regardless of its relationship to 
investigational product) that occurs within [ADDRESS_264508] be reported in accordance with procedures specified in this protocol.  
All deaths of subjects, regardless of cause, and which are known to the Investigator will be 
reported on the appropriate eCRF for up to 30 days after the administration of study drug, regardless of the Investigator's opi[INVESTIGATOR_85155]. Documentation of the subject’s cause of death and a copy of the autopsy or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_85156]. The Medical Monitor and CRO contact [INVESTIGATOR_9960] 24 hours of knowledge of the event 
by [CONTACT_756] (and/or fac simile/email) of all subject deaths. Written follow -up must be received 

Protocol V01- 123A -301, IDP -123           Valeant Research & Development  
 
Version 2, [ADDRESS_264509]/Independent Ethics Committee 
(IRB/IEC)  within five (5) calendar days of initial notification.  
 
The investigator should take all appropriate measures to ensure the safety of the subjects, notably 
he/she should follow a subject with an SAE until the event has resolved or the condition has stabilized. This may imply that follow -up will continue after the subject has left the study, and 
that additional investigations may be requested by [CONTACT_1034]. When a SAE persists at the end 
of the study, the Investigator will conduct follow-up contacts with the subject until the Investigator/Sponsor agree the event is satisfactorily resolved and/or stabilized. If at any time after 30 days after administration of study drug, the investigator becomes aware of an SAE which he/she feels is related to study drug or procedure, this must also be reported immediately (within 24 hours of knowledge of occurrence) by [CONTACT_220155]/email to the Medical Monitor and Sponsor and/or Sponsor designee. 
11.4.7 Expedited Serious Adverse Event Reports  
An AE, whether serious or non-serious, is designated unexpected (unlabeled) if it is not reported in the clinical safety section of the Investigator Brochure or if the event is of greater frequency, specificity or severity.  
Expedited SAE reports are those that are both unexpected based on the reference document (Investigator Brochure) and are rel ated ( i.e., the relationship cannot be ruled out) to the study 
drug. These expedited reports are subject to reporting timelines of 7 and/or 15 calendar days to the regulatory reporting agency(ies). The Sponsor will notify regulatory authorities of these AEs 
and all participating investigational centers in writing for submission by [CONTACT_85213]/IEC. This notification will be in the form of a Safety Update to the Investigator Brochure (i.e., “15- day letter”).  
Upon receiving such notices, the investigator must review and retain the notice with the Investigator Brochure and immediately submit a copy of this information to the responsible IRB/IEC according to local regulations. The investigator and IRB /IEC will determine if the 
informed consent requires revision. The investigator should also comply with the IRB/IEC procedures for reporting any other safety information. 
11.4.[ADDRESS_264510] review the following information about study participation: 
• Informed consent requirements

Version 2, [ADDRESS_264511] 2017  CONFIDENTIAL  
47 • Contraceptives in current use 
Following review of this information and appropriate subject counseling, the investigator or 
designee and the subject must sign the informed consent before study enrollment. 
During the study, all female subjects of childbearing potential should be instruct ed to contact [CONTACT_85214] (e .g., missed or late menstrual 
period). If a subject or investigator suspects that the subject may be pregnant prior to study enrollment, 
the study drug must be withheld unt il the results of laboratory pregnancy testing are available. If 
pregnancy is confirmed, the subject must not receive study drug and must not be enrolled in the study. If pregnancy is suspected while the subject is receiving study treatment, the study drug  
must immediately be withheld until the result of pregnancy testing is known. If pregnancy is confirmed, the study drug will be permanently discontinued and the subject will be followed until the pregnancy comes to term. A Pregnancy Report form will be submitted to the Sponsor, 
initially and at the end of the pregnancy, which includes the outcome of the pregnancy and any complications occurring during the pregnancy or the delivery. 
All confirmed pregnancies must be immediately reported to the Medical Monitor and CRO 
contact [INVESTIGATOR_874] 24 hours of the investigator’s awareness of the pregnancy. All confirmed 
pregnancies are to be reported on a pregnancy form using the same reporting procedure for an 
SAE under Section 11.4.6. 
12 Statistics  
All statistical processing will be performed using SAS® version 9.3 or later unless otherwise 
stated. Statistical significance will be based on two -tailed tests of the null hypothesis resulting in 
p-values of 0.05 or less. The primary method of handling missing efficacy data will be based on estimation using the 
method of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) imputation.  This method provides robust 
estimation when the pattern of missingness is arbitrary.  Additionally, the estimation will be done for each treatment group separately so that the pattern of missingness for one group does not influence the estimation of missing data for another group.  Groups of complete datasets 
following the es timation will be concatenated to f orm analysis datasets for the comparative 
analyses  and subsequent imputation result inference with SAS PROC MIANALYZE. 
Descriptive statistics will also be derived from the multiply imputed datasets . 
Additionally, a model-b ased multiple imputation process will be used as a sensitivity analysis to 
the MCMC imputation.  Finally, the absolute change in lesion count will be analyzed using a 
repeated measures ANCOVA for lesion count data or a repeated measures logistic regression model (generalized estimating equations) for the dichotomized EGSS.

48 A statistical analysis plan (SAP), describing all statistical analyses will be provided as a separate 
document. The SAP will be finalized prior to unblinding of the study treatments. 
Evalu ations and Analyses 
Inflammatory lesions and non- inflammatory lesions will be recorded for each subject at Baseline 
and at Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12. The absolute and percent change from baseline of inflammatory 
lesions and non- inflammatory lesions will be der ived for each subject at Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12. 
The EGSS will be recorded for each Subject. The EGSS will be dichotomized into “success” and “failure” at Week 2, 4, 8, and [ADDRESS_264513] Clear.  
Subjects will be asked to complete the Acne- Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire at Baseline 
and Week 12.  
All assessments will be  conducted for both ITT and PP. 
12.1 Assessment of Effic acy 
Primary, secondary, and supportive efficacy analyses will be conducted on the ITT (primary) 
population. Primary efficacy analyses will be conducted on the PP (supportive) population. 
12.1.1 Primary Efficacy  
There are three co -primary efficacy endpoints:  
• Absolute change in inflammatory lesion count from Baseline to Week 12 
• Absolute change in non- inflammatory lesion count from Baseline to Week 12 
• Proportion of subjects who have at least a 2 grade reduction at Week 12 from 
Baseline in the Evaluator's Global Severity Score and are Clear or Almost Clear  
12.1.2 Secondary Efficacy  
The secondary efficacy endpoints will be the following : 
• Percent change in inflammatory lesion count from Baseline to Week 12  
• Percent change in non -inflammatory lesion count from Baseline to Week 12  
• Proportion of subjects who have at least a 2 grade reduction at Week 12 from Baseline in the Evaluator's Global Severity Score  
• Percent change in inflammatory lesion count from Baseline to Week 8  
• Percent change in non -inflammatory lesion count from Baseline to Week 8  
• Percent change in inflammatory lesion count from Baseline to Week 4  
• Percent change in non -inflammatory lesion count from Baseline to Week 4  
12.1.3 Supportive Efficacy

12.1.[ADDRESS_264515] wil l be included in the model; 
otherwise it will be removed.  
A skewness test, based on the methods presented by J.H. Zar (1984) [ 10], will be applied to the 
residuals resulting from an ANCOVA. A two -sided p- value for the skewness test significant at 
0.01 will imply the use of the non- parametric method. If a parametric analysis is indicated, the 
results of the parametric analy sis will be considered the primary analysis. Should a non-
parametric analysis be indicated, the absolute or percent changes in inflammatory and non -
inflammatory lesions will be rank transformed prior to submitting them to the ANCOVA. Results of the rank- transformed analyses then will be considered the primary analys is; however, 
results of the non- ranked transformed analyses will also be presented . 
12.1.[ADDRESS_264516] of Superiority for EGSS  
The EGSS will be dichotomized into “success” and “failure” with a subject considered a success for those visits if the Evaluator’s Global Severity Score is at least [ADDRESS_264517] Clear. The analysis of the dichotomized Evaluator's Global Severity Score will be based on a logistic regression test with factors of treatment group and analysis center.  
12.1.6 Statistical Hypothesis Testing and Control of Multiplicity  
Statistical hypothesis testing for lesion count analyses will use the statistical model introduced in

12.1.8 Pooling Analysis 
The clinical study will be conducted under a common protocol for each investigational site with 
the intention of pooling the data for analysis.  Every effort will be made to promote consistency in study execution at each investigational site. The study is intended to b e conducted in a manner 
such that a minimum of 5 subjects will be enrolled in each treatment arm for any investigator.  In the event that there are too few subjects in a treatment arm for an investigator, then this investigator's data will be combined to a chieve the desired sample size minimum per arm.  The 
combining of investigator's data will be accomplished by [CONTACT_220156] .  If there is 
a further need to combine data, then the data of the investigator with the second smallest 
enrollment will be combined with the investigator's data which had the second largest enrollment,  and so on.  This process will continue for all investigators who did not have a 
minimum of [ADDRESS_264525] insufficient subjects per treatment arm will result in redefining the groups of investigators for the purposes of statistical analyses.  These combined groups will be referred to as "analysis centers" in the statistical analyses based on ANCOVA and stratified logistic testing.  
Prior to investigating the treatment effect within the analysis centers, the magnitude of the site main effect will be investigated to determine if the main site -to-site variability is such that it 
Protocol V01- 123A -301, IDP -123           Valeant Research & Development  
 
Version 2, [ADDRESS_264526] ANCOVA 
(for lesion count variables) or a logistic regression analysis (for EGSS) with a factor of site will 
be conducted prior to pooling. If the data structure interferes with the logistic regression, a descriptive analysis of the site effect will be undertaken. Conclusions appropriate to the findings of this step will be presented. 
The consistency of treatment  response will be investigated across the analysis centers subsequent 
to combining the data as described above.  Statistical tests will be conducted to identify if there 
are extreme analysis centers that could affect the interpretation of common statistical and clinical conclusions.  An analysis center by [CONTACT_220157] 0.10.  Change from baseline in inflammatory lesions and non- inflammatory lesions will be analyzed with an 
ANCOVA (unranked or ranked) with factors of treatment, analysis center, and treatment by 
[CONTACT_85218] a covariate.  For the purpose of testing consistency of treatment response, the dichotomized E GSS will be 
analyzed with a logistic regression procedure with factors of treatment, analysis center, and 
treatment by [CONTACT_85219]. Further examination will follow for any variables that have a significant AN COVA or logistic regression interaction term.  In the event that the 
ANCOVA or logistic regression interaction (referred to henceforth as the "appropriate test") p-value is less than or equal to 0.10, a sensitivity analysis that excludes analysis centers with the extreme efficacy result will be performed to determine the robustness of the treatment effect.  On the other hand, if the outcome of the appropriate test has a p-value greater than 0.10, then the conclusions from the pooled da ta will be considered to be free of the impact of extreme analysis 
centers . 
The first step in conducting a sensitivity analysis is to identify the extreme analysis center or centers that contribute to the statistical significance of the appropriate test.  The process involves 
submitting subsets of analysis centers to the appropriate test and observing the appropriate test p-value for the subset.  Subsets with p-values greater than 0.[ADDRESS_264527] p -value are deemed the extreme 
analysis centers.  
Protocol V01- 123A -301, IDP -123           Valeant Research & Development  
 
Version 2, [ADDRESS_264528]-hoc aspects of the process will be given when the results are interpreted.  Conclusions will be presented by [CONTACT_85220]. 
12.1.9 Missing Efficacy Data Imputations 
Lesion Count Variable Missing Data Imputation 
Missing 12 week data will be estimated by [CONTACT_85221]. Missing lesion count data will be derived for the analysis using the method of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) multiple imputation which does not rely on the assumption of data 
missing at random. Additionally, the pattern of missing observations in each treatment group cannot influence the missing value estimation in the other because the imputation is being conducted independently for each treatment group. 
Multiple imputation and subsequent analysis will involve [ADDRESS_264529] phases with these principal 
tasks:  
 
1. Calculate the number of missing values to be estimated by [CONTACT_85222] (nmiss) for 12 week 
value.  
2. Create a data set of subjects, one for each treatment group, with observed values and those needing estimation by [CONTACT_85222].  The missing lesion count values in each data set will be filled in using the MCMC method ‘5 x nmiss’ times to generate ‘5 x nmiss’ data sets.

EGSS Missing Data Imputation 
A similar procedure will be used for the analyses based on proportion of EGSS successes wherein the ANCOVA analysis is replaced with a logistic regression analysis.  Specifically, missing 12 week EGSS values from which the dichotomized EGSS is derived will be estimated by (MCMC) which does not rely on the assumption of data missing at random. Additionally, the pattern of missing observations in each treatment group cannot influence the missing value estimation in the other because the imputation is being conducted independently for each treatment group.  
The missing 12 week EGSS values will be derived for the analysis using the method of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) multiple imputation. Multiple imputation and subsequent analysis will involve 4 principal tasks: 
1. Calculate the number of missing values to be estimated by [CONTACT_85222] (nmiss) for 12 week 
value.  
2. Create a data set, one for each treatment group, of subjects with observed values and those needing estimation by [CONTACT_85222].  The missing EGSS values in each data set will be filled in using the MCMC method ‘5 x nmiss’ times to generate ‘5 x nmiss’ data sets.

12.1.[ADDRESS_264532] sensitivity analysis for absolute change in lesion count will use a repeated measures  
ANCOVA, with treatment, analysis center, and visit (ie, Week 4, Week 8) as independent factors and a covariate of baseline lesion count.  In this analysis, data from all post- baseline visits will 
be included with no imputation for missing data. 
The second  sensitivity analysis will use the model based multiple imputation method to impute 
missing data for the absolute change in lesion counts at Week 12.  Although the full details will 
be presented in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP), the multiple imputation will involve 4 principal tasks: 
1. Calculate the number of missing values (nmiss) for absolute change in lesion counts. 
2. Missing values will be filled in ‘5 x nmiss’ times to generate ‘5 x nmiss’ complete data sets.  The imputation model used will be an ANCOVA with factors of treatment group and analysis center, and a covariate of baseline lesion count (ie, the imputation model will be the same as the analysis model). Appropriate modifications will be made should the analysis be based on a non- parametr ic method.  
3. Each complete data set will be analyzed with an ANCOVA with factors of treatment group, and analysis center, and a covariate of baseline lesion count. 
4. Results from these analyses will be combined into a single inference.  
Sensitivity analys es for EGSS 
The first sensitivity analysis for the dichotomized EGSS success will use a repeated measures logistic regression model (generalized estimating equations), with dichotomized EGSS success as the dependent variable and treatment, analysis center,  and visit (i.e., Week 4, Week 8) as 
independent factors.  In this analysis, data from all post- baseline visits will be included with no 
imputation for missing data.

57 study medication usage, the action taken to treat the AE, and the outcome. All reported 
treatment -emergent AEs (TEAEs) will be summarized by [CONTACT_28240], 
system organ class , severity, seriousness, and relationship to study medication. TEAEs are those 
AEs with an onset on or after the date of the first study drug application. 
Adverse events will be summarized by [CONTACT_85225].  Each subject will be 
counted only once within a system organ class or a preferred term by [CONTACT_220159] . 
Adverse events will be summarized by [CONTACT_220160].  Each subject will be counted only once within a system organ class or a preferred term by [CONTACT_220161].  
Comparisons among treatment groups will be made by [CONTACT_220162] (classified i nto MedDRA terms) during the study.  The Fisher’s Exact test will 
be used to compare the proportion of subjects in each treatment group who report any adverse event at a significance level of 0.05.  The specific system organ classes and preferred terms analyzed will be those that are reported by [CONTACT_220133]. 
All information pertaining to AEs noted during the study will be listed by [CONTACT_1130], detailing 
verbatim given by [CONTACT_093], preferred term, system o rgan class, start date, stop date, 
severity, actions taken, and drug relatedness. The AE onset will also be shown relative (in 
number of days) to the day of initial dose of the randomized study medication. 
Serious adverse events (SAEs) will be tabulated by  [CONTACT_85177] . 
In addition, a list of subjects who discontinued from the study and a list of subjects who 
experienced SAEs will also be provided.

Version 2, [ADDRESS_264537] demographic and baseline characteristics will be summarized by [CONTACT_220163], PP, and safety populations. For continuous variables (e.g. age) comparisons among the two  
treatment groups will be conducted using a two- way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with factors 
of treatmen t group and analysis center. Ethnicity and race will be analyzed with a Cochran -
Mantel -Haenszel test stratified by [CONTACT_85229] . Past and current medical conditions, as well as 
history of disease will be presented in a data listing.  
12.[ADDRESS_264538]  9 years of age and older with moderate  or severe acne ( a 
score of 3 or 4 [moderate to severe] on the EGSS scale) will be enrolled and randomized in the study. With a 1:1 randomization ratio, it is anticipated that: 
• 400 subjects will be randomized to receive IDP -123 Lotion, once- daily applicati on 
• [ADDRESS_264539] of all randomized subjects who were dispensed study 
medication. The safety population will be comprised of all randomized subjects who are

Version 2, [ADDRESS_264540]-
baseline safety evaluation.  
An intent- to-treat (ITT) analysis will be co nducted on all study subjects. A per- protocol (PP) 
analysis will also be conducted. Subjects will be eligible for the PP analysis if they complete the 12-week evaluation without noteworthy study protocol violations (i.e., any subject or investigator activity that could have possibly interfered with the therapeutic administration of the treatment or the precise evaluation of treatment efficacy). The PP population will include 
subjects in the safety population who do not meet any of the following criteria: 
• Failed any of the inclusion/exclusion criteria; 
• Have taken any interfering concomitant medications;  
• Did not attend the Week 12 visit; 
• Missed more than [ADDRESS_264541] baseline study visit prior to Week 12 
• Have not been compliant with the dosing regimen (i.e., Subject s may not miss more 
than five consecutive days of dosing and must take 80-120% of expected doses. The number of expected doses will be determined for each subject based on the length of their participation in the study);  
• Out of visit window at the 12- week visit.  
Subjects that  discontinue from the study due to an adverse event related to study treatment or 
documented lack of treatment effect will be included in the PP population. Prior to breaking the 
blind, other additional criteria may be added to the list to accommodate for unforeseen events that occurred during the conduct of the trial that result in noteworthy study protocol violations.  
The safety population will be comprised of all randomized subjects who are presumed to have 
used the study medication at least once and who provide at least one post- baseline safety 
evaluation.  
12.8.2 Sample Size Determination  
These power calculations are based primarily on the observed Week 12 results of the Phase 2 study, V01-123A-201. This study was a four- arm trial inclu ding IDP -123 Lotion versus its 
Vehicle L otion and cream and is therefore a relevant study for powering the current study.  
A sample size of 400 per treatment arm has greater than 99% power to detect a statistically significant difference in inflammatory lesio ns with a significance level of 0.05. The estimated 
absolute change from baseline in treatment means were 18.[ADDRESS_264542] deviation of 8.75. 
A sample size of 400 per treatment arm has greater than 99% power to detect a statistically 
significant difference in non- inflammatory lesions with a significance level of 0.[ADDRESS_264543] deviation of 14.0.

proportion of subjects who have at least a [ADDRESS_264545] Clear are 18.8% and 10.1% for IDP-123 Lotion 
versus its Combined Vehicle respectively. 
12.8.3 Handling of Missing Data 
The method of multiple imputation will be used (see Section 12.1.9).  
12.8.4 Multicenter Issues  
The study will be conducted at multiple investigational centers in North America with  the 
intention of pooling the results for analysis. Site specific data summaries, however, will be presented.  
12.8.5 Multiplicity Issues  
The overall Type I error will be controlled by [CONTACT_85230]- primary efficacy endpoints 
to be statistically significa nt. Specifically, failure of any one of the primary efficacy endpoints 
will invalidate the statistical significance of the secondary efficacy endpoints. See Section 12.1.6 for further detail.  
12.8.6 Windowing Rules  
The timing of all study visits is relative to Ba seline (Day 0). The Week 2, Week 4 and Week 8 
visits should occur within ± 3 days of the scheduled times, the Week 12 visit should occur within 
-3 / + 5 days of the scheduled time.

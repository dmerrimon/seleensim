3 STUDY DESIGN This is a randomized, open-label trial to evaluate whether suppression of Hsp27 
production using OGX-427, a second-generation antisense oligonucleotide (ASO), 
in combination with docetaxel can prolong survival time compared to docetaxel 
alone in participants with locally-advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (UC) 
that are relapsed or refractory after receiving a platinum-containing regimen. A SYNOPSIS

STUDY PHASE  II 
OBJECTIVES Primary Objective: 
 
• To determine whether docetaxel administered in combination with OGX-427 
provides a survival benefit compared to docetaxel alone. 
 
Secondary Objectives: 
 
• To compare the safety and tolerability of OGX-427 in combination 
with docetaxel to that of docetaxel alone. 
 
• To compare overall response rate (ORR) (complete response [CR] + 
partial response [PR]), disease control rate (CR+PR+stable disease), 
duration of response, and progression-free survival (PFS) between the 
treatment arms. 
 
• To evaluate the effect of therapy with docetaxel and OGX-427 on 
serum Hsp27 levels and other serum proteins and explore their relation 
with clinical outcomes. 
 
• To evaluate the association of urothelial carcinoma expression of 
Hsp27 measured by [CONTACT_9064] (IHC) in archival tissue 
with clinical outcomes. 
 
• To evaluate the effect of therapy on peripheral blood circulating tumor 
cells (CTC) enumeration and expression of Hsp27 and other relevant 
proteins via immunoflourescence and levels of telomerase by 
[CONTACT_137414] (PCR), and explore their 
relation with clinical outcomes.  
 
• Somatic (tumor) and germ-line DNA/ RNA will be isolated to allow

7 STATISTICAL 
CONSIDERATIONS 
 Participants will be randomized with 1:1 allocation to receive docetaxel ± OGX-
427 using permuted blocks methods within strata.39  Overall survival is defined in 
Section 10.4. 
 
Based on the docetaxel plus vandetanib vs. docetaxel trial33  in a similar patient 
population, the median OS on the docetaxel control arm is expected to be 6 
months (hazard rate of 0.1155). This study is designed to have adequate power to 
detect a 33% reduction in the OS hazard rate (to 0.0770) on the docetaxel + 
OGX-[ADDRESS_156010] ratio (docetaxel + OGX-427/ docetaxel) 
= 0.667. If OS follows an exponential distribution, then this difference 
corresponds approximately to a 50% improvement in median OS (to 9 months on 
the docetaxel + OGX-427 arm ). The null hypothesis is no difference in treatment 
e
ffect. The primary analysis is a superiority test of OS, performed at one-sided 
0.[ADDRESS_156011].40 There will be 90% power 
to detect this OS difference assuming 200 participants are enrolled over 31 
months with 8 months of additional follow-up (39 months/3.25 years total 
duration).  Full information under the alternative hypothesis will occur at 162 
deaths.  
 
The Kaplan-Meier (KM) method will be used to estimate OS distributions by 
[CONTACT_2939].41 A stratified Cox proportional hazards (PH) regression model will 
estimate the OS treatment hazard ratio and 80% 2-sided confidence intervals in 
unadjusted and adjusted models.[ADDRESS_156012] ratios within subgroups and testing for 
treatment-by-subgroup interaction in Cox PH regression models.  
 
The study will also be monitored for futility with one interim analysis, planned 
prior to completion of accrual at approximately 50% information (approximately 
81 deaths).  The decision for early rejection of the experimental therapy will be 
guided by a hazard ratio boundary using the spending function methodology of 
Lan and DeMets with O’Brien-Fleming parameter to adjust the boundary for the 
actual interim analysis time. If conducted precisely at 50% information, the cut-
off hazard ratio is 1.[ADDRESS_156013] version 5.2

13 1. OBJECTIVES 
1.1 S tudy Design 
 
This is a randomized, open-label Phase 2 clinical trial to evaluate whether suppression of Hsp27 
production using OGX-427, a second-generation antisense oligonucleotide (ASO), in 
combination with docetaxel can prolong survival time compared to docetaxel alone in 
participants with metastatic or inoperable, locally-advanced urothelial carcinoma (UC) that 
relapsed after, or is refractory to a platinum-containing regimen. A total of approximately 200 
subjects (100 in each arm) will be stratified (see Section 5.6) and randomized to a 1:1 ratio to 
one of two arms. One interim analysis will occur to determine whether to stop study enrollment 
based on survival futility. The trial will not be stopped early based on efficacy. 
 
1.2 Primary Objective 
 
•    To determine whether docetaxel administered in combination with OGX-427 provides 
a survival benefit compared to docetaxel alone.  
  
1.3 Secondary Objectives 
 
• To compare the safety and tolerability of OGX-427 in combination with docetaxel 
to that of docetaxel alone. 
• To compare overall response rate (ORR) (complete response [CR] + partial 
response [PR]), disease control rate (CR+PR+stable disease), duration of response 
(see Section 10.3.7), and progression-free survival (PFS) between the treatment 
arms. 
• To evaluate the effect of therapy with docetaxel and OGX-427 on serum Hsp27 
levels and other serum proteins and explore their relation with clinical outcomes. 
• To evaluate the association of urothelial carcinoma expression of Hsp27 measured 
by [CONTACT_9064] (IHC) in archival tissue with clinical outcomes. 
• To evaluate the effect of therapy on peripheral blood circulating tumor cells 
(CTC) enumeration and expression of Hsp27 and other relevant proteins via 
immunoflourescence and levels of telomerase by [CONTACT_956], and explore 
their relation with clinical outcomes. 
• Somatic (tumor) and germ-line DNA/ RNA will be isolated to allow future 
approved investigations to determine if somatic mutations in Hsp27, ABCB1, 
ABCG2, TUBB4 and other relevant genes of interest are associated with 
treatment outcome (optional informed consent).

14Heat shock proteins are a family of highly conserved proteins whose expression is induced by 
[CONTACT_137417], oxidative stress, cytotoxic chemotherapy, and radiation. Heat 
shock proteins such as Hsp27 potently inhibit amorphous aggregation of target proteins under 
stress conditions, acting on the slow, off-folding protein pathway to play a key role against 
harmful protein accumulation.  
 
Hsp27 has a multiplicity of cellular and molecular functions, including transcription factors, 
signal-transducing receptor kinases, cell-cycle regulators, steroid hormone receptors, and 
delivery of ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation pathway.1,[ADDRESS_156023] treatment-induced cell death.  
 
Hsp27 interacts with many key apoptosis-associated proteins to regulate a cell’s apoptotic rheostat, 
including the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways. The intrinsic pathway primarily functions through 
intracellular death signals, which trigger outer mitochondrial membrane permeabilization, leading to 
the release of cytochrome-c. Cytochrome-c interacts with Apaf-1 and caspase-9 to form the 
“apoptosome” which activates caspase-3, leading to an activation cascade of downstream caspases, 
the so called “effectors” of cell death. The extrinsic pathway is activated through cell membrane-
associated proteins of the TNF receptor family (such as Fas, Trail-R1, Trail-R2 and others) which 
can trigger caspase-independent apoptosis or directly activate caspase-8, which leads to activation of 
the downstream effector caspases. Hsp27 inhibits apoptotic cell death by a variety of mechanisms 
involving both pathways. Hsp27 can inhibit apoptosis by [CONTACT_137418]-c,9 by [CONTACT_137419]-3,10 inhibiting Fas-induced caspase-
independent apoptosis,10,11 counter-acting reactive oxygen species12 and by [CONTACT_137420], thus preventing disruption of the cytoskeleton.13 Hsp27 
is also involved in regulation of AKT14 and enhances NF-kB activity by [CONTACT_137421] I-B.15 Hsp27 also chaperones and shuttles stat3 into the nucleus, enhancing transcription of 
several stat3-regulated survival genes.16  
 
This brief review illustrates that Hsp27 may serve as a therapeutic ‘hyper-node,’ a target situated 
as a ‘hub” at the center of many pathways regulating response of a cell to therapeutic stress. 
Targeting Hsp27 is attractive as it would affect multiple pathways implicated in cancer progression 
and resistance, as opposed to targeting a single pathway, a strategy that might have limited benefits in 
the face of the redundant signaling pathways and heterogeneity characteristic of cancer.

radical cystectomy, with no expression in adjacent normal urothelium.19 Another analysis of 42 
patients with superficial bladder cancer showed that Hsp27 was highly expressed in over 50% of 
cells in 83% of tumors.20 Kassem et al. investigated the expression-profile of stress-related and 
DNA repair genes by [CONTACT_137423]-PCR confirmation in both a

are not amenable to such tactics, and, therefore, strategies to inhibit these targets at the gene 
expression level are an attractive concept. Antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) therapy is one such 
strategy to specifically target functionally relevant genes. ASOs are chemically modified 
stretches of single-strand DNA complementary to the mRNA regions of a target gene that inhibit 
translation by [CONTACT_137424]/DNA duplexes, thereby [CONTACT_137425].22,[ADDRESS_156026] part, toxicity has been 
non-sequence specific and attributable to the phosphorothioate backbone. However, in clinical 
trials with phosphorothioate “first generation” ASOs, continuous or frequent intravenous (IV) 
infusions were required because of their relatively short plasma half-lives and rapid degradation. 
Therefore, considerable effort has been made to improve the stability and potency of ASOs by 
[CONTACT_137426]-linkages or alterations to the ring structure or the ribosugars.  
 
Advances in nucleic acid chemistry have yielded ASO modifications such as the 
2´-O-(2-methoxyethyl) or 2´-MOE modification to selected ribosugars that make an 
oligonucleotide more resistant to nuclease degradation.25,26 The 2´-MOE modification is 
incorporated at the 2´-position of the ribosugar moiety at selected portions of the 
oligonucleotides. 2´-MOE ASOs form duplexes with RNA with a significantly higher affinity 
relative to unmodified phosphorothioate ASOs, which results in improved antisense potency both 
in cell culture systems and in animals. In addition, 2´-MOE ASOs display significantly improved 
resistance against nuclease-mediated metabolism relative to earlier types of phosphorothioate 
ASOs,25,26 resulting in significantly improved tissue half-life in vivo , which produces a longer

A fourth study with OGX-427 is ongoing at a single medical center in Canada (Study BL-01) as 
an Investigator-sponsored study. In this study, OGX-427 is administered by [CONTACT_137434] (directly into the bladder) in subjects with bladder cancer prior to transurethral 
resection of the bladder tumor or radical cystectomy. In this Phase 1 study, subjects are treated 
with intravesical OGX-427 on days 1, 3, 5, and 8 and then undergo surgery on days 9-12. The 
dose of OGX-427 is being escalated after tolerability and safety assessment for each cohort 
(20uM, 50uM, 100uM, 250uM, 500uM, and 750uM). Objectives include safety and 
pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and biologic effects of intravesical OGX-427. Currently,

(gemcitabine plus cisplatin [GC] or methotrexate, cisplatin, doxorubicin, and vinblastine 
[MVAC]). Once patients progress through one of these regimens, there is no second-line 
standard of care. Many agents, including docetaxel, paclitaxel, and ifosfamide, have shown 
single agent responses (between 10-20%, which improve with combination therapy),29-[ADDRESS_156050] commonly used (either 
in combination or as single agents).  
 
Relevant to this protocol, docetaxel (Taxotere) is a commonly used chemotherapeutic agent in 
urothelial carcinoma, both as a single agent and in combination with other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. In a Phase 2 
study of single agent docetaxel in second-line or later metastatic urothelial carcinoma, the 
response rate was 13%, with a median survival of [ADDRESS_156051], or fourth line did not result in

had a median PFS of 2.56 months, median OS of 5.85 months, and ORR of 7%; patients 
receiving docetaxel plus placebo had a median PFS of 1.58 months, median OS of 7.03 months, 
and ORR of 11%.[ADDRESS_156052] supportive care alone.34 Three adverse risk factors were prognostic 
of OS: Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status > 0, hemoglobin level 
< 10 g/dL, and the presence of liver metastases. A scoring system was developed to classify 
second-line urothelial cancer patients into four risk groups based on the presence of 0, 1, 2, or 3 
of these prognostic risk factors. Application of this scoring system to the 370-patient cohort 
resulted in median OS times for these groups of 14.2, 7.3, 3,8, and 1.7 months (P<0.001), 
respectively.  
 
In addition, time from prior chemotherapy has been shown to be important in determining 
outcomes in previously treated urothelial carcinoma patients.[ADDRESS_156053] limited success in preventing tumor recurrence 
and/or progression, and overall mortality rates have remained fairly constant. The prognosis of 
patients with invasive or metastatic disease is extremely poor. Cisplatin-based chemotherapy 
regimens, such as gemcitabine and cisplatin, are the mainstay of treatment for patients with 
advanced disease. However, twenty years of experience have failed to make much progress in 
improving patient outcomes. Although urothelial carcinoma is considered to be a chemotherapy-
sensitive neoplasm, the efficacy of combination chemotherapy has been restricted because of de 
novo drug resistance and acquired resistance. Thus, there is a need to identify mechanisms by 
[CONTACT_137435], 
hopefully, improve survival, especially in relapsed or refractory urothelial carcinoma after 
receiving platinum-based chemotherapy. 
 
Heat shock proteins such as Hsp27 play a crucial role in regulating the balance between cell 
survival and death by [CONTACT_137436], folding, and 
assembly of polypeptides. Hsp27 expression is increased in many cancers including bladder 
cancer. Overexpression has been associated with inhibition of apoptosis, increased 
cytoprotection, and the development of treatment resistance by [CONTACT_137437]. ASOs specifically hybridize with complementary mRNA 
regions to form RNA/DNA duplexes to inhibit target gene expression. OGX-427 is a second-

31generation ASO that effectively targets and down-regulates Hsp27 mRNA and has been shown 
to increase apoptosis, inhibit tumor growth, and sensitize cells to chemotherapy in a variety of 
malignancies including bladder cancer. These findings provide preclinical proof of principle for 
its use in the treatment of this disease.  
 
A Phase [ADDRESS_156054], ovarian, lung, and bladder cancer has shown 
tolerable doses of OGX-427 up to 1000 mg when administered alone or with docetaxel 
chemotherapy. Biological activity as monotherapy was observed by [CONTACT_137438], decreases in tumor markers, and circulating tumor cell (CTC) responses. Another 
Phase 1 study evaluating OGX-427 by [CONTACT_137439] (directly into the bladder) in 
subjects with bladder cancer prior to transurethral resection of the bladder tumor or radical 
cystectomy has shown 38% complete pathological responses. 
 
Given the poor outcomes for patients with advanced, refractory metastatic urothelial carcinoma, 
the preclinical rationale for the addition of OGX-[ADDRESS_156055] a 
control is ideal to investigate the activity of docetaxel and OGX-427. Improved OS compared to 
a contemporaneous control (rather than an historical control, which could suffer from many 
biases) would provide a strong rationale to move forward with Phase 3 testing in this patient 
population. The use of objective response as the primary endpoint is not an ideal surrogate for 
clinical benefit. Median OS in patients with metastatic urothelial cancer previously treated with 
chemotherapy is only 6-7 months. The recent contemporary Phase 2 study of taxane 
chemotherapy demonstrated a median OS of 6.7 months.33 Since survival time is so short, using 
OS as a screen for clinical benefit in this context is appropriate. This study will stratify patients 
based on the presence of 3 known adverse prognostic factors: hepatic metastases, anemia, and 
impaired performance status, which have been identified as driving outcomes in previously-
treated patients with advanced bladder cancer.37 In addition, time from prior chemotherapy has 
been shown to be important in predicting outcomes and adds significance to the second-line 
prognostic factors. 
 
Therefore, there will be two stratification factors. Randomization will be stratified based on  
the risk categories: presence of 0 or 1-3 adverse prognostic factors (liver metastases, hemoglobin 
< 10 g/dL, ECOG PS 1) and time from prior systemic chemotherapy < 3 months vs.  3 months 
(
as defined in Section 5.6).

collected to assess Hsp27 IHC staining to determine whether tissue levels of Hsp27 are 
associated with outcome in patients treated with OGX-427. It is hypothesized that elevated

2.[ADDRESS_156057] cancer (Herceptest) or colorectal cancer (K-Ras mutations). 
Peripheral blood circulating tumor cells (CTCs) recently have been shown to have prognostic 
and predictive value in metastatic breast, colon and prostate cancer. In prostate (as well as in 
breast and colon) cancer, quantification of CTCs before and after therapy has been shown to 
predict overall disease response, and the CellSearch assay has been approved by [CONTACT_137440]. This assay, nevertheless, has limitations. Aside from associated costs, the assay 
depends on enrichment of CTCs based on their expression of EpCAM, a variably expressed cell 
surface marker, adversely affecting CTC enrichment. It is also likely that enumeration of CTC 
alone may be inadequate as prognostic and predictive marker for therapeutic response; particular 
biomarkers expressed on CTCs may provide a wealth of additional information about clinical 
outcome and response to therapy. Finally, although the utility of CTC analysis in other common 
malignancies has been widely demonstrated, few studies have investigated the utility of CTCs to 
predict therapeutic response in bladder cancer, and there are currently no studies that directly 
evaluate the expression of a therapeutic target on CTCs to predict and monitor treatment 
efficacy.  
 
In response to these unmet clinical needs, collaborators at the University of Miami – Miller 
School of Medicine have developed a microfabricated parylene membrane-based device capable 
of capturing CTCs based on their larger size relative to hematopoietic cells, and have shown its 
utility in capturing CTC in cancer patient blood samples with high efficiency and with enhanced 
ease and speed.[ADDRESS_156058]

and placed onto a glass microscope slide for downstream molecular analyses. There is evidence 
that not only the capture, but also the characterization of CTC can provide additional information 
regarding optimal therapeutic efficacy, as demonstrated by [CONTACT_137441]-EGFR therapy.[ADDRESS_156059] further 
enhanced our microfilter devices by [CONTACT_137442], such as on-chip multi-marker immunohistochemistry and genetic tests, which 
adds a useful dimension besides CTC quantification.  
 
Molecular Characterization of CTCs by [CONTACT_137443]: Recently, the microfilter device 
for CTC capture and molecular analysis was used in the SWOG S0421 phase III double-blind 
clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of Atrasentan, an endothelin-1 A receptor (ETAR) inhibitor, 
in combination with docetaxel versus docetaxel + prednisone to treat metastatic castration-
resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Preliminary analysis of [ADDRESS_156060] therapeutic efficacy, and evaluation of ETAR expression directly on CTCs demonstrates 
the potential of captured CTCs to be characterized for expression of therapeutic targets and 
markers of response [unpublished data]. In the current study, we plan to evaluate our ability to 
predict the therapeutic efficacy of OGX-[ADDRESS_156061] and monitor 
treatment efficacy.   
 
Molecular Characterization of CTCs by [CONTACT_137444]:  
Telomerase is an enzyme which lengthens and protects telomeres, the tandem repetitive DNA 
sequences that cap the ends of human chromosomes. Whereas benign, terminally differentiated 
tissues have extremely low telomerase level, malignant cells from a variety of cancers have 
significantly elevated telomerase expression and telomerase activity levels. The robust presence 
of telomerase in cancer cells and its relative absence from benign tissues has led to a profusion of 
studies to assess its biomarker utility for diagnosis and prognosis. Telomerase has emerged as a 
cancer-specific biomarker that is consistently detected in primary tumors, metastases, and 
circulating tumor cells. In multiple studies over the past decade, telomerase activity was shown 
to provide significant diagnostic and prognostic utility across numerous cancer types.   
 
As described in above, telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein complex that synthesizes 6 base 
telomeric repeats (TTAGGG) onto the 3’ end of existing telomeres. This mechanism of action 
led to the development of the TRAP (Telomeric Repeat Amplification Protocol) assay, a two-
step PCR-based method to detect telomerase activity in vitro . Briefly, a cell or tissue sample is 
lysed in CHAPS-based lysis buffer and the cell lysate, which contains telomerase, is collected 
and analyzed in 2 steps: In the first step, called the extension step, an aliquot of cell lysate is 
mixed with a telomerase substrate oligonucleotide (TS) in the presence of dNTPs. Telomerase 
catalyzes the addition of telomeric repeats onto the 3’ end of TS. The amount of extended 
telomeric repeats is directly proportional to the amount of telomerase present in the cell lysate. In 
the second step, called the amplification step, the products of the extension reaction (step 1) are 
amplified by [CONTACT_137445] a reverse primer and are subsequently visualized and quantified by [CONTACT_137446]12-160                                                                                                               Version 7 Date 15OCT2014

34electrophoresis. More recently, variety of real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) detection methods 
have been developed in order to make the amplification (second) step simpler, faster and more 
reliable. After the extension (first) step is completed (as per classical TRAP assay), a reverse 
“ACX” primer is used in the second step for amplification by [CONTACT_5203]-time PCR. The ACX primer 
contains mismatches which prevent primer-dimer formation while still enabling amplification of 
the extension products. Prior to starting every qPCR-TRAP assay, cell numbers and protein 
levels in cell lysates are measured and equalized to ensure that results reflect equal input 
amounts. Ultimately, qPCR-TRAP produces a SYBR green curve from which the threshold cycle 
of detection (Ct – inversely proportional to starting amounts) is calculated for each sample. 
Standard control samples are run with every qPCR-TRAP reaction to generate a standard curve. 
This curve serves both as a control for the efficiency of the real-time PCR reaction and for 
normalization and comparison of the unknown samples to the known standard controls.  
 
qPCR-TRAP has also been used to detect changes in cancer cell telomerase activity when 
inhibiting proliferation, as well as telomerase activity levels from prostate cancer cells derived 
from freshly resected primary prostatectomy specimens. Most recently, as part of the SWOG 
S0421 phase III double-blind clinical trial described previously above, blood samples were 
evaluated from 262 mCRPC patients being treated with Atrasentan in combination with 
docetaxel versus docetaxel + prednisone, the standard of care for this diagnosis. Results from this 
study demonstrate that telomerase activity measured from CTCs captured by [CONTACT_137447]-ever CTC-derived biomarker prognostic of overall survival in a large 
prospective clinical trial.  In the current study, we plan to use our previously optimized protocols 
to predict the therapeutic efficacy of OGX-427 in combination with docetaxel versus docetaxel 
alone in metastatic bladder cancer as a second line therapy through the measurement of 
telomerase activity in CTCs.

395.1 OGX-427 Loading Dose Period: Arm A Participants Only 
 
Participants randomized onto the investigational arm (Arm A) are to receive OGX-[ADDRESS_156071] one “non-infusion” day between each 
administration of OGX-427 (i.e., every other day) during the Loading Dose Period and between 
the third loading dose of OGX-427 and Day 1 of Cycle 1 (when docetaxel treatment will begin). 
More than one day can separate administrations, provided that all [ADDRESS_156072] loading dose and Cycle 1, Day 1 is 
allowed. A common schedule would be to give the three loading doses of OGX-427 on 
Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, with Cycle 1 Day 1 starting on the following Monday. 
The day prior to Day 1 of Cycle 1 (identified as Day 0) should be a no treatment day (e.g., 
Sunday in the above example). Participants will receive each dose of OGX-427 as an 
approximately 2-hour infusion. Sites should make every effort to target infusion timing to be as 
close to 120 minutes as possible. However, given the variability of infusion pumps from site to 
site, a window of ± 10 minutes is permitted. 
 
Because Grade 1 and 2 constitutional symptoms (e.g., chills, fever, pruritus, flushing) are seen in 
the majority of participants during the loading-dose infusions, all participants will be

Docetaxel (75 mg/M2) will be administered IV on Day [ADDRESS_156074] v1.1, unacceptable toxicity, 
completion of 10 cycles, or voluntary withdrawal (see Section 5.14). 
 
5.3 OGX-427 Maintenance: Arm A Participants Only 
 
Following completion of [ADDRESS_156075] 
disease progression (i.e., stable disease or better) (see Section 5.9). Participants without 
documented disease progression who have discontinued from docetaxel treatment not due to 
OGX-427-related toxicity can also continue to receive OGX-[ADDRESS_156076] 2 cycles of chemotherapy.  Maintenance 
with OGX-427 will continue until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. 
 
5.4 Follow-up: All Participants 
 
Imaging studies will be performed every 6 weeks (i.e., after completion of Cycles 2, 4, 6, 8 and 
10) until disease progression and with any sign or symptom of new or worsening disease; CT of 
chest/abdomen/pelvis is preferred but MRI is acceptable, especially for participants with 
increased risk of contrast-related nephropathy or other contraindications. For Arm A, scans will 
be performed every 2 cycles (6 weeks) during the 21-day cycles of docetaxel administration and 
every 6 weeks during maintenance OGX-427 administration until disease progression; for Arm 
B, scans will be performed every 6 weeks during the 21-day cycles of docetaxel administration 
until disease progression. A window of ±[ADDRESS_156077] 4 cycles of treatment (i.e., at the end of 
Cycles 2 and 4) and then every 12 weeks thereafter until disease progression (i.e., at the end of 
Cycle 8, at End of Treatment, and during maintenance with OGX-427 [Arm A only]).  
 
If new clinical signs or symptoms of disease progression have developed, repeat imaging as 
clinically indicated, preferably using the same modality as baseline, when appropriate. 
 
All participants will have an End of Treatment (EOT) visit when they discontinue study 
treatment. All participants will be followed until documented disease progression. Participants 
who discontinue study treatment for any reason, without documented disease progression, and 
who initiate other cancer treatment, will be followed for survival according to the Survival 
Follow-up Period outlined below. 
 
Once disease progression is documented, participants will enter a Survival Follow-up Period. All 
participants must be followed for survival as the primary endpoint. During the Survival Follow-
up Period, data will be collected every three months regarding further cancer therapy, secondary 
malignancy, and survival status.

6.1.2 Anticipated Toxicities for Docetaxel  
The risks and side effects observed with docetaxel when used as monotherapy in a population of 
patients previously treated with a platinum-based chemotherapy are summarized below. For 
more detailed information on docetaxel anticipated toxicities, please refer to the package insert 
for docetaxel. 
 
Myelosuppression, predominately neutropenia, is the DLT of docetaxel with a nadir at days 7-10 
and recovery by [CONTACT_137455] 14. CBCs with differential and platelet count should be 
monitored. 
 
Docetaxel is hepatotoxic and should be used with caution in patients with abnormal liver 
function. 
 
Docetaxel is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to docetaxel or to 
polysorbate 80. Reactions (flushing, fever, rigors, rash, hypotension, dyspnea, and/or 
bronchospasm) usually occur within the first few minutes of the first or second administrations 
and almost all occur within the first 10 minutes. Severe reactions occur in < 5% of patients. 
Patients should be closely monitored during infusions. Resuscitation equipment should be ready 
at the bedside. 
 
Fluid retention is seen in around 25-50% of patients and can be severe (ascites, pleural, or 
pericardial effusions) in around 7% of patients. 
 
All participants should receive corticosteroid premedication before docetaxel administration to 
reduce the incidence and severity of fluid retention as well as the severity of hypersensitivity 
reactions. Refer to institutional standards for recommendations on premedication prior to 
docetaxel administration.

drug reaction information. 
 
7.2.1 Description  
Taxotere® is a semisynthetic analog of paclitaxel using a precursor extracted from the needles of 
the European yew tree. Taxotere®’s high affinity for binding to microtubules enhances tubular 
polymerization, leading to inhibition of mitosis and cell division. Taxotere® is a cell-cycle 
specific agent with activity in the mitotic phase. Taxotere® is a member of the taxoid family. 
The molecular weight is 861.94 Da. 
 
7.2.2 Form  
Taxotere® is formulated in polysorbate 80 and commercially available.  
 
7.2.3 Storage and Stability  
Taxotere® vials should be stored between 2-25ºC. Unopened vials require protection from light. 
Allow to stand at room temperature for 5 minutes before reconstitution. Taxotere® is 
reconstituted with the provided diluent to give a concentration of 10 mg/mL. Use only glass, 
polypropylene or polyolefin plastic IV bags. It is then further diluted in an appropriate volume of 
D5W or normal saline to a final concentration of 0.3 to 0.94 mg/mL. Taxotere® final dilution for 
infusion, if stored between 2°C and 25°C (36°F and 77°F) is stable for 4 hours. Taxotere® final 
dilution for infusion (in either 0.9% Sodium Chloride solution or 5% Dextrose solution) should 
be used within 4 hours (including the 1 hour intravenous administration).

7.2.7 Preparation and Administration 
Please follow package insert for specific instructions.   
 
1-vial Taxotere® (docetaxel) Injection Concentrate requires NO prior dilution with a diluent 
and is ready to add to the infusion solution. Use only a 21 gauge needle to withdraw 
TAXOTERE from the vial because larger bore needles (e.g., 18 and 19 gauge) may result in 
stopper coring and rubber particulates. 
1. TAXOTERE vials should be stored between 2 and 25°C (36 and 77°F). If the vials 
are stored under refrigeration, allow the appropriate number of vials of 
TAXOTERE Injection Concentrate vials to stand at room temperature for 
approximately 5 minutes before use. 
2. Aseptically withdraw the required amount of TAXOTERE injection concentrate 
(20 mg docetaxel/ mL) with a calibrated syringe and inject into a 250 mL infusion 
bag or bottle of either 0.9% Sodium Chloride solution or 5% Dextrose solution to 
produce a final concentration of 0.3 mg/mL to 0.74 mg/mL.  
If a dose greater than 200 mg of TAXOTERE is required, use a larger volume of 
the infusion vehicle so that a concentration of 0.74 mg/mL TAXOTERE is not 
exceeded.  
3. Thoroughly mix the infusion by [CONTACT_137460]. 
4. As with all parenteral products, TAXOTERE should be inspected visually for 
particulate matter or discoloration prior to administration whenever the solution 
and container permit. If the TAXOTERE dilution for intravenous infusion is not 
clear or appears to have precipi[INVESTIGATOR_332], it should be discarded. 
 
The Taxotere® dilution for infusion should be administered intravenously over approximately 
1-hour per institutional standards, under ambient room temperature (below 25°C) and lighting 
conditions. 
 
1-vial Taxotere® Injection Concentrate is a sterile, non-pyrogenic, pale yellow to brownish-
yellow solution at 20 mg/mL concentration. Each mL of 1-vial Taxotere® contains 20 mg 
docetaxel (anhydrous) in 0.54 grams polysorbate 80 and 0.395 grams dehydrated alcohol 
solution. 1 
 
Taxotere® is supplied in a single use clear glass vial with a red flip-off cap for the 80-mg vial 
and a green cap for the 20-mg vial. Each vial is provided in a blister pack in a single carton. [ADDRESS_156137] of the Taxotere concentrate with plasticized PVC equipment or devices used to 
prepare solutions for infusion is not recommended. To minimize participant exposure to the 
plasticizer DEHP (di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate), which may be leached from PVC infusion bags 
or sets, the final Taxotere® dilution for infusion should be stored in bottles (glass, 
polypropylene) or plastic bags (polypropylene, polyolefin) and administered through 
polyethylene-lined administration sets. 1

73 Study Calendar Footnotes: 
1Screening evaluations will be completed within a 28-day period + 3 days (i.e. from the first screening evaluation to randomization) 
unless otherwise specified.  
2Participants will be randomly assigned with equal probability to one of two arms: Arm A: docetaxel plus OGX-427; Arm B: 
docetaxel alone. Participants must receive their first dose of Study Drug within 5 days of randomization. 
3For participants in Arm A, three separate administrations of OGX-427 (600 mg OGX-427) will be given IV over [ADDRESS_156140] one “non-treatment” day between each dose. To allow 
for holidays and clinical availability, a maximum of [ADDRESS_156141] discontinued study treatment without documented disease progression and not due to toxicity 
related to OGX-427 should continue weekly OGX-427 infusions as maintenance until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. 
5Off Treatment Follow-up Period: evaluations should continue every 6 weeks (± 7 days) until disease progression. 
6Participants who have documented disease progression will be followed every 3 months (± 7 days) for documentation of anticancer 
therapy, secondary malignancies, and survival status. Survival follow-up can be accomplished by [CONTACT_137461], telephone 
contact [CONTACT_6635], or through the primary practitioner or caregiver. 
7Disease history, including histological diagnosis of urothelial carcinoma and documentation of mixed histology as required, date of 
initial diagnosis, TNM stage at diagnosis and prior administration of all cancer therapy for bladder cancer including intravesicular, 
neo-adjuvant or adjuvant therapy, surgery, hormonal therapy, radiation, chemotherapy, biologics, and experimental agents. 
8Update concurrent illnesses prior to first loading dose for Arm A. Update concurrent illnesses prior to first dose Cycle 1 Day 1 for 
Arm B. 
9 Perform complete physical examination at Screening (including tumor measurements of palpable disease, if appropriate). A limited 
PE examination related to signs, symptoms and concurrent illnesses is appropriate during the study.  
10Weight is not required during the Off Treatment Follow-up Period.

pre-dose day 1 cycle 3 and 5. (See SPM for collection processing and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_3931]) 
19Blood for circulating tumor cell (CTC) capture and analysis will be collected and shipped to University of Miami (UM). Blood 
should be drawn at screening and pre-dose on Day 1 of Cycles 2, 3 and 5. (See SPM for collection processing and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_3930]). If blood for CTC is missed at Screening, collect pre-dose at loading dose [ADDRESS_156146]/abdomen/pelvic CT scans (CT preferred, but MRI acceptable especially for participants with increased risk of contrast

for this study within [ADDRESS_156147]/abdomen/pelvis (CT preferred, but MRI acceptable especially for participants with increased 
risk of contrast related nephropathy or other contraindications) will be performed at baseline, every [ADDRESS_156148] 4 cycles of treatment (i.e., at the end of Cycles 2 and 4) every 12 weeks thereafter until disease progression (i.e., at the end of 
Cycle 8, at End of Treatment, and during maintenance with OGX-427 [Arm A only]), and with any sign or symptom of new or 
worsening bone disease or increase in alkaline phosphatase felt to be of bone origin. If new clinical signs or symptoms of disease 
progression have developed, repeat imaging as clinically indicated, preferably using the same modality as baseline, when appropriate.  
There is a 5 day window for scans prior to Day 1 of each cycle while patients are on treatment.  There is a 7 day window for scans at 
EOT, disease progression/follow-up and survival. 
21Participants should be pre-medicated at 30-[ADDRESS_156149] dose of Study Drug. All SAEs and Grade 3 or higher AEs that are ongoing at the end of study

HCRN GU12-[ADDRESS_156151]   
Although response is not the primary endpoint of thi s trial, participants with measurable 
and/or non-measurable disease will be assessed by [CONTACT_393] v1.1.  For the purposes of this 
s
tudy, participants should be reevaluated every [ADDRESS_156152] on Measurable and Non-measurable Disease (RECIST v1.1) 
For the purposes of this study, participants should be re-evaluated for response every 6 weeks. 
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the new international criteria 
proposed by [CONTACT_8225] (RECIST  v1.1).38 Changes 
in the diameter (unidimensional measurement) of the tumor lesions are based on the 
RECIST v1.1 criteria as described below for both measurable and non-measurable disease. 
 
10.1.1  Measurable Disease (Target Lesions) 
Lesions must be able to be accurately measured in at least one dimension with the longest 
diameter ≥  [ADDRESS_156153] by   [ADDRESS_156154] (unless contraindicated i.e. especially for participants with increased risk 
of contrast related nephropathy) should be performed with slice thickness no greater than [ADDRESS_156155] or MRI, whenever possible. 
 
At baseline, measurable lesions representing overall tumor burden up to a maximum of 2 lesions 
per organ and 5 lesions in total should be identified as “target lesions” and recorded and 
measured. Lesions which are unsuitable for accurate, repeated measurements should not be 
selected as target lesions.  A sum of the diameters (long axis for non-nodal and short axis for 
nodal lesions) of all target lesions at baseline will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum 
diameter. This will be used as reference to characterize disease progression. Multiple target 
lesions should be reported consistently on the eCRFs in the same lesion order (i.e., with the same 
number) and with the same location descriptor on each subsequent examination. 
 
10.1.2  Non-Measurable Disease (Non-Target Lesions) 
All other lesions or sites of disease, including lesions on bone scan , should be identified as 
“non-target lesions” and should also be recorded at baseline. This includes small lesions (longest 
diameter <10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with 10 to <15 mm short axis) or measurable 
lesions in excess of [ADDRESS_156156] be recorded as “present”, “absent”, or “new” at the time of each tumor 
evaluation. Multiple non-target lesions should be reported consistently on the eCRFs in the same 
lesion order (i.e., with the same number) and with the same location descriptor on each 
subsequent examination.

Clinical lesions. Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are 
superficial (e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes). For the case of skin lesions, 
documentation by [CONTACT_6775], including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is 
recommended. 
 
Chest x-ray. Lesions on chest x-ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when they are 
clearly defined and surrounded by [CONTACT_6776]; however, CT is preferable. 
 
Conventional CT and MRI. These techniques should be performed with cuts of [ADDRESS_156158], abdomen, and 
pelvis.  
 
FDG PET and PET/CT. The acquisition of FDG PET and FDG PET/CT scans should 
follow the NCI Guidelines for using FDG PET as an indicator of therapeutic response 
(L.K. Shankar, J.M. Hoffman, S. Bacharach, M.M. Graham, J. Karp, A.A. Lammertsma, S.

responses (PR) and complete responses (CR) in rare cases (e.g., residual lesions in tumor 
types, such as germ cell tumors, where known residual benign tumors can remain). 
 
The cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears or 
worsens during treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or 
stable disease is mandatory to differentiate between response or stable disease (an effusion 
may be a side effect of the treatment) and progressive disease.

criteria.  
 
10.3.1  Complete Response (CR) 
Complete disappearance of all measurable and non-measurable disease with no new lesions. Any 
pathological lymph node (target or non-target) must have a reduction in short axis to < 10 mm). 
All markers of disease must have normalized. In some circumstances it may be difficult to 
distinguish residual disease from normal tissue. When determining a CR, it is recommended that 
such lesions be investigated by [CONTACT_14239][INVESTIGATOR_137405].  
 
10.3.2  Partial Response (PR) 
A decrease from baseline of ≥ 30% of the diameter(s) of all target measurable lesions with no 
unequivocal  progression of non-measurable lesions and no new lesions.  
 
10.3.3  Stable Disease (SD) 
Does not qualify for CR, PR, or progression. 
 
10.3.4  Progression of Disease (PD) 
One or more of the following [ADDRESS_156162] occur for documentation of disease progression: 
1. Appearance of any new lesion or site of disease. (Lesions in areas not previously 
imaged will be considered new).  
2. A 20% increase in the sum of the diameter(s) of target measurable lesions over either 
the smallest sum observed or over baseline if no decrease during therapy has 
occurred. The sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. 
3. Unequivocal  progression of non-target lesions alone.  
 
Note: Disease progression based solely on “non-target” lesions alone is exceptional  and must be 
made in the context of the entire clinical pi[INVESTIGATOR_1103]. Worsening (increase in intensity or size of a 
lesion) of pre-existing non-target lesions, including bone lesions, may be difficult to interpret 
and, therefore, will not be considered evidence of progressive disease. In addition, the following 
will not  constitute unequivocal progression: 
• Worsening (increased in intensity or size of a lesion) of pre-existing lesions on bone scan 
only, with no new documented lesions. 
• Appearance or worsening of pleural effusions, unless cytologically proven to be 
malignant in origin.

 79 10.3.5  Not Evaluable (NE) 
When no imaging/measurement is performed at a particular time point, the patient is not 
evaluable (NE) at that time point. If only a subset of lesion measurements are made at an 
assessment, the case is also considered NE at that time point, unless PD is otherwise determined. 
Prior to any new anticancer therapy, every attempt should be made to perform an imaging 
evaluation.

achieving stable disease (SD) or better [CR+PR+SD].

10.3.7  Duration of Response 
Duration of overall response: The duration of overal l response is measured from the time 
measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that 
recurrence or PD is objectively documented, taking as reference for PD the smallest 
measurements recorded since the treatment started. 
 
Duration of overall complete response: The duration of overall CR is measured from the time 
measurement criteria are first met for CR until the first date that recurrent disease is 
objectively documented. 
 
Duration of stable disease: Stable disease is measured from randomization until the criteria 
for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded since the 
treatment started.

Progression-Free Survival (PFS) is defined as the du ration of time from randomization to time of

objective disease progression, PFS will be censored at the date of last disease evaluation without 
progression, unless death occurs within a short period of time (6 weeks, corresponding to the

 81 11. ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING REQUIREMENTS 
 
1
1.1 Definitions 
 
11.1.1  Adverse Event (AE) 
An adverse event (AE) is any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom or disease temporally associated with the administration, at any 
dose, of a medicinal or therapeutic product whether or not considered related to that product. 
Abnormal laboratory values or diagnostic test results constitute adverse events only if they 
induce clinical signs or symptoms or require treatment or further diagnostic tests.  
 
11.1.2  Serious adverse event (SAE) 
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any adverse event, occurring at any dose and regardless of 
causality that:  
• Results in death 
• Is life-threatening. Life-threatening means that the person was at immediate risk 
of death from the reaction as it occurred, i.e., it does not include a reaction which 
hypothetically might have caused death had it occurred in a more severe form. 
• Requires or prolongs inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (i.e., the event required at least a 
24-hour hospi[INVESTIGATOR_57891] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_137406]). Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6930]/or surgical operations scheduled to occur 
during the study period, but planned prior to study entry are not considered SAEs 
if the illness or disease existed before the person was enrolled in the trial, 
provided that it did not deteriorate in an unexpected manner during the trial (e.g., 
surgery performed earlier than planned). 
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity. Disability is defined as a 
substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions. 
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect; or 
• Is an important medical event when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, it 
may jeopardize the participant and require medical  or surgical intervention to 
p
revent one of the outcomes listed above. Examples of such medical events 
include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency 
room or at home; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
 
Events not considered to be serious adverse events are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5315]: 
• routine treatment or monitoring of the studied indication, not associated with any 
deterioration in condition, or for elective procedures 
• elective or pre-planned treatment for a pre-existing condition that did not worsen 
• emergency outpatient treatment for an event not fulfilling the serious criteria 
outlined above and not resulting in inpatient admission 
• respi[INVESTIGATOR_4594] 
• hospi[INVESTIGATOR_137407] 
 
11.1.3  Expectedness 
Adverse events can be 'Expected' or 'Unexpected.'

 82 [IP_ADDRESS]  Expected adverse event  
E
xpected adverse events are those that have been previously identified as resulting from 
administration of the agent. For the purposes of this study, an adverse event is considered 
expected when it appears in the current adverse event list, the Investigator’s Brochure, or is 
included in the informed consent document as a potential risk. 
 
Refer to Section 6.1 for a listing of expected adverse events associated with the study 
agent(s). 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Unexpected adverse event  
F
or the purposes of this study, an adverse event is considered unexpected when it varies in 
nature, intensity or frequency from information provided in the current adverse event list, the 
Investigator’s Brochure, the package insert or when it is not included in the informed consent 
document as a potential risk.   
 
11.1.4  Attribution 
Attribution is the relationship between an adverse event or serious adverse event and the study 
treatment. Attribution will be assigned as follows: 
• Definite – The AE is clearly related to the study treatment. 
• Probable – The AE is likely related to the study treatment. 
• Possible – The AE may be related to the study treatment.  
• Unrelated - The AE is clearly NOT related  to the study treatment.

 83 Each investigative site will be responsible to report SAEs that occur at that institution to their 
respective IRB. It is the responsibility of each participating investigator to report serious adverse 
events to HCRN and/or others as described below.  
 
11.4 Study Center (Site) Requirements for Reporting SAEs 
Investigators and other site personnel must report any SAEs occurring during the course of the 
study within one business day of discovery of the event.  This includes events both related and 
unrelated to the investigational product.   
 
The completed SAE Report Form (see Study Procedure Manual) must be faxed to HCRN 
within 1 working day of discovery of the event.   The investigator is responsible for informing 
the IRB and/or the Regulatory Authority of the SAE as per local requirements. 
 
The original copy of the SAE Report and the fax confirmation sheet must be kept within the 
Trial Master File at the study site. 
 
Follow-up information will be faxed to HCRN, using a new SAE Report Form stating that this is 
a follow-up to the previously reported SAE and giving the date of the original report. Each re-
occurrence, complication, or progression of the original event should be reported as a follow-up 
to that event regardless of when it occurs. The follow-up information should describe whether 
the event has resolved or continues, if and how it was treated, whether the blind was broken or 
not (if applicable), and whether the participant continued or withdrew from study participation. 
 
11.[ADDRESS_156167] be reported primarily for the purposes of SAE 
reporting; however, deaths due unequivocally to progression are not SAEs.   
 
Your local IRB should be notified and their reporting procedure followed.  The completed SAE 
Reporting Form should be faxed to HCRN within one working day of discovery of the event . 
 
11.6 HCRN Requirements for Reporting SAEs 
HCRN will report any SAE to OncoGenex within one working day  of receipt of the SAE 
Reporting Form and to regulatory authorities (FDA) per federal guidelines.

11.8 Reporting to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
HCRN has been designated to manage the Investigator held IND on behalf of  Noah Hahn, MD, 
Sponsor Investigator and will be responsible for all communication with the FDA. HCRN will 
report to the FDA, regardless of the site of occurrence, any adverse event that is serious, 
unexpected and reasonably related (i.e., possible, probable, definite) to the study treatment. 
 
According to CFR 312.32, unexpected fatal or life-threatening experiences associated with the 
use of the study treatment will be reported to FDA by [CONTACT_137465] [ADDRESS_156169] manager assigned to the IND ([PHONE_3089]. A comprehensive written report 
will be submitted as an amendment to the IND within an additional 8 days (15 calendar days 
total). 
 
All other serious unexpected experiences associated with the use of the study treatment will be 
reported to FDA as an amendment to the IND as soon as possible but in no event later than 15 
calendar days after initial receipt of the information. 
 
Events may be reported to the FDA using Form FDA 3500A or narrative format. Forms are 
available at http://www.fda.gov/medwatch/getforms.htm.  
 
11.9 IND Safety Reports Unrelated to This Trial 
IND safety reports not occurring on this trial but involving OGX-427 (outside SAEs) received 
from outside sources will be forwarded to participating sites for submission to their Institutional 
Review Boards per their guidelines.

S
tatistical analysis for this study will be the responsibility of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute 
(DFCI) Dept. of Biostatistics and Computational Biology. 
 
15.1 Study Design/Primary Objectives 
This is a randomized, open-label trial to evaluate whether suppression of Hsp27 production using 
OGX-427, a second-generation antisense oligonucleotide (ASO), in combination with docetaxel 
can prolong OS time compared to docetaxel alone in participants with metastatic or inoperable, 
locally-advanced urothelial carcinoma (UC) that are relapsed after, or refractory to a platinum-
containing regimen. Participants will be randomized with 1:1 allocation to receive docetaxel +/- 
OGX-427 using permuted blocks methods within strata.39  Overall survival is defined in 
Section 10.4.  
 
Based on the docetaxel plus vandetanib vs. docetaxel trial33 in a similar patient population, the 
median OS on the docetaxel control arm is expected to be 6 months (hazard rate of 0.1155). This 
study is designed to have adequate power to detect a 33% reduction in the OS hazard rate (to 
0.0770) on the docetaxel + OGX-[ADDRESS_156180] ratio (docetaxel + OGX-
427/ docetaxel) = 0.667. If OS follows an exponential distribution, then this difference 
corresponds approximately to a 50% improvement in median OS (to 9 months on the docetaxel + 
OGX-427 arm ). The null hypothesis is no difference in treatment effect. The primary analysis is 
a superiority test of OS, performed at one-sided 0.[ADDRESS_156181].40 There will be 90% power to detect this OS difference assuming 200 participants are 
enrolled over 31 months with 8 months of additional follow-up (39 months/3.25 years total 
duration).  Full information under the alternative hypothesis will occur at 162 deaths.  
 
The Kaplan-Meier (KM) method will be used to estimate OS distributions by [CONTACT_2939].41 A 
stratified Cox proportional hazards (PH) regression model will estimate the OS treatment hazard 
ratio and 80% 2-sided confidence intervals in unadjusted and adjusted models.[ADDRESS_156182] ratios within subgroups and testing for

 90 The study will also be monitored for futility with one interim analysis, planned prior to 
completion of accrual at approximately 50% information (approximately 81 deaths).  Routine 
study procedures will continue during the interim analysis. The decision for early rejection of the 
experimental therapy will be guided by a hazard ratio boundary using the spending function 
methodology of Lan and DeMets with O’Brien-Fleming parameter to adjust the boundary for the 
actual interim analysis time. If conducted precisely at 50% information, the cut-off hazard ratio 
is 1.[ADDRESS_156183] version 5.2 (Cytel Inc.). 
 
15.2 Sample Size/Accrual Rate 
To enroll 200 participants, accrual duration is expected to be 31 months (2.6 years) with a 
segmented accrual rate target to account for slower accrual while institutions activate the trial: [ADDRESS_156184] 6 months and 7 participants per month for the remainder of the 
accrual period. Thus in years 1, 2 and 3 the accrual goals are 66, 84 and 50 participants, 
respectively. Accrual expectations use as reference the multi-institution (n=17 institutions) 
vandetanib docetaxel trial, which achieved an overall accrual rate of [ADDRESS_156185] year was 7 participants per month.  
 
15.3 Stratification Factors 
As specified in Section 5.6, randomization will be stratified in order to minimize between-arm 
imbalance using two stratification factors: time from prior systemic chemotherapy (<3 versus 3 
m
onths); and number of Bellmunt37 prognostic factors prior to randomization (0 versus 1-3 
factors).  
 
Evaluation of primary and secondary endpoints incorporates methods for stratified analyses.

experienced. Adverse events will be summarized according to grade, overall and by [CONTACT_54012], as number and percentage of participants. Specific adverse events (to be pre-specified in the 
Statistical Analysis Plan) will be compared between groups using Fisher’s exact tests. 
 
Overall response rate and disease control rate (defined in Section 10.3.6) will be summarized as 
number and percentage of participants by [CONTACT_137478]-sided 80% CI and compared 
using Fisher’s exact tests. With 100 participants per treatment arm and assuming 10% overall 
response rate in the docetaxel control arm, there is 80% power to detect an improvement to 22% 
in the experimental docetaxel + OGX-427 arm (Fisher’s exact test, one-sided  =0.10). 
 
T
he distributions of duration of response (Section 10.3.7) and PFS (Section 10.3.8) will be 
estimated using KM method by [CONTACT_2939], with median and two-sided 80% CI of the 
distribution summarized. PFS will be compared between treatment arms using a stratified 
HCRN GU12-160                                                                                                               Version 7Date 15OCT2014

 [ADDRESS_156187]. With 100 participants per group and assuming 1.5 month (6 week) median PFS in 
the docetaxel control arm, there is over 90% power to detect an improvement to 3 month (12 
week) median PFS in the experimental docetaxel + OGX-427 arm (logrank test, one-sided =0. 
1
0; 71 required PFS events). 
 
Serum levels of Hsp27 (or other proteins) will be summarized descriptively over time as median 
and inter-quartile ranges at baseline and each treatment cycle, separately by [CONTACT_2939]. The 
percentage changes in serum levels from baseline over time will also be summarized, as well as 
the maximum percentage of serum level decline from baseline over [ADDRESS_156188] better OS when 
treated with docetaxel+OGX-427 vs. docetaxel alone relative to participants with lower Hsp27 
levels. Since no clinically meaningful cutoff point has been previously established, serum Hsp27 
(or other protein) levels will be categorized at quartiles or median for assessing the associations 
with OS. The distribution of OS according to Hsp27 level will be estimated using KM method, 
overall and by [CONTACT_2939].  A stratified Cox PH regression model will be used to assess the 
association of Hsp27 with OS, to estimate treatment hazard ratios by [CONTACT_137479]27 subgroup, and to test 
the treatment-by-Hsp27 interaction. To investigate the association of percentage changes in 
serum Hsp27 level with OS, a landmark analysis approach (with a landmark set after cycle 2, 
i.e., [ADDRESS_156189]) will be used. The serum Hsp27 measurements 
during the first 2 cycles on study therapy will be used to calculate the maximum percentage of 
decline from baseline.  Among participants who are alive after cycle 2, the association of 
maximum decline in serum Hsp27 levels with OS (re-defined from the landmark point) will be 
investigated as described above. 
 
CTC enumeration and expression of Hsp27 and other relevant proteins will be measured by 
[CONTACT_137480], 
day 1 cycle 2, day 1 cycle 3 and day 1 cycle 5.  The associations of CTC number, telomerase 
activity and CTC expression of Hsp27 at Screening with OS will be evaluated, similarly as 
described above for serum Hsp27 levels.  The changes of CTC number, telomerase activity and 
expression of Hsp27 from Screening to day 1 cycle 2 will be summarized descriptively, and their 
association with OS will be evaluated using a landmark analysis.  CTC measurements and 
telomerase activity also will be summarized according to patient disease status at time of day 1 
cycle 3 and day 1 cycle 5 when radiographic evaluation are done.  
 
Hsp27 protein is highly expressed in bladder tumor tissue, with one cohort20 of 42 samples 
reporting 9.5%, 7%, 28.5%, 55% of samples having 0, 1-50%, 51-80% and >80% Hsp27 
immunostaining, respectively. Tumor expression of Hsp27 will be summarized descriptively as 
median and inter-quartile ranges. Since no clinically meaningful cutoff point has been previously 
established, Hsp27 expression will be categorized at quartiles or median, and the association 
with OS investigated as described above for serum levels. 
 
In consideration of power for correlative studies, we assume 80% of participants have samples 
assayed (160 participants; 130 deaths). Assuming Hsp27 is dichotomized at the median, there is 
HCRN GU12-160                                                                                                               Version 7Date 15OCT2014

i
nteraction, assuming the overall treatment hazard ratio is 0.[ADDRESS_156190] ratio is 
0.69, then there is 75% power to detect an interaction ratio of 0.5 (e.g., high Hsp27 treatment 
HR=0.44 vs. low Hsp27 HR=0.88) (one-sided  =0.10).

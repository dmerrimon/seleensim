reported as non -responders at the maximal approved dose of 75mg daily. The trend in 
both normal volunteers (Jenkins et al Blood 200 7) and in patients with ITP suggests  an 
increasing response rate with increas ing doses of eltrombopag up to a dose of 75 mg . 
(Bussel et al. NEJM 2007)  In fact, at 50 mg there was a 70% response rate and at 75 mg 
there was an 81% response rate in the initial ITP study.(Bussel et al. NEJM 20 07) 
Furthermore, the occurrence of platelet counts  > 200,000/ul was substantially more 
frequent at 75 mg compared to 50 mg as well.   In the confirmatory study, approximately 
1/3 of the patients who did not respond to 50 mg did subsequently respond to 75 mg, 
although the response rate overall was only 59% compared to 16% in placebo.( Bussel et 
al. Lancet 2009). In the RAISE study, two key issues emerged. First the majority of 
patients ended up on 75 mg by [CONTACT_2054]. Second , the odds of respondin g at 
each assessment point was barely 50% if not very occasionally below 50% during the 
study.  (Cheng et al. Lancet 2011) Altogether these data suggest to us that a higher dose 
of eltr ombopag m ay be useful  in some patients  
Data from the PETIT and PETIT2 s tudies in pediatric patients (who seem to metabolize 
eltrombopag differently especially at younger ages) f ound that in the middle and lowest 
age cohort s, even doses of [ADDRESS_847691] required doses > 2 mg/kg in 
almost all cases (and even > 3 mg/kg) in order for the children to respond. In the middle 
cohort this was dose limiting because a ceiling of 75 mg was reached rapi[INVESTIGATOR_634759] 37 .5 kg .  (Bussel et al, PETIT in press Lancet Haem 2015 )  
Additional data accumulating from the pediatric clinical trials support this observation 
that younger children require an increase d weight base dose to reach a platelet response. 
In the PETIT Study , the older pediatric patients  (12-17 year olds)  average dose was 1.2 
mg/kg compared with 2.9 mg/kg to the youngest cohort (1 -5 year olds) ( Bussel et al , in 
press Lancet Haem 2015 ). The PETIT II study also report ed an increased proportional 
dose requirement  in the youngest cohort. (Grainger, in press Lancet Haem 2015 ).  All of 
the available data using eltrombo pag in research trials or clinical practice in > [ADDRESS_847692] profile remains 
favorable , particularly given the alternatives in this age group.  (Ramaswamy et al, JPeds, 
2014)  
Published data has shown pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of eltrombopag in 
healthy volunteers at an escalated dose range 100 -200mg po daily for 5 days. (Matth ys et 
al J Clin Pharmacol. 2011).  Healthy volunteer data also showed a dose dependent 
platelet response, with a safety profile similar to placebo. Data recently presented at the 
ASH 2011 Meeting in refractory severe aplastic anemia patients showed safe do se 
escalation of eltrombopag to a maximum of 150mg with a 44% response rate. (Olnes et 
al. NEJM 2013 ) Additional phase I data presented in stem cell transplant patients, has 
shown  doses of up to [ADDRESS_847693] not caused dose limiting toxicities and are  also 
well tolerated (Liesveld et al. Blood 2011) .

Document date here : 10-13-[ADDRESS_847694] been defined as ‘non -
responders’ at the maximum dose (75mg) of eltrombopag.  The study will also assess 
efficacy and toxicity at higher daily doses (100mg, 125mg, 150mg) in this population.  
The study will be performed at a single center in North America, (Weill Cornell Medical 
College). There will be two p arts to it. First the randomized double blind p art to be 
described next. Subsequently an open label study similar to the EXTEND study 
(TRA105325 ;https://www.clinicaltr ials.gov/ct2/show/[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]?term=Bussel+Dose
+Escalation&rank=1 ) in patients who responded at doses of 100 to 150mg to see if they 
maintain or even improve their response and to investigate the eltrombopag safety profile 
over up to 18 months at these high er doses.    
Furthermore, the patients randomized to the placebo  arm can  go on open label treatment 
at higher doses if they did not increase their counts on placebo. Even though open label, 
they will serve as a confirmatory group.  
2. OBJECTIVE(S)  
2.1. Primary Objec tive 
To determine the proportion of  patients with chronic ITP who d o not respond to [ADDRESS_847695] for 2 weeks at doses of 100, then for 2 weeks at 125 mg and final ly for 4 weeks 
at a dose of 150mg daily.  The intial double -blind phase  will stop if/when  the platelet 
count exceeds 100,000 /uL.   Complete response (CR) will be defined as 2 consecutive  
platelet counts of greater than or equal to 50,000 AND an increase of greater than or 
equal to 20,000 from the study baseline within the 8 week increased dose window not as 
a result of rescue treatment. Partial response (PR) will be defined as 2 consecutive 
platelet counts of greater than or equal to 50,000 OR an increase of  greater than or equal 
to 20,000 from the study baseline within the 8 week increased dose window not as a 
result of rescue treatment.

number of patients achieving a platelet count > 100,000 , and number of platelet counts 
per patient  > 100,000.  (Note if a platelet count > 100,000  is achieved that week and the 
subsequent weeks of the 8 week study will be considered to all be over 100,000 for 
purposes of all analyses).  
To determine efficacy of administration of increased dosage of eltr ombopag to subjects  
with ITP who did not respond to current maximally approved daily dose of [ADDRESS_847697] 3 weeks . 
To evaluate if there are subgroups of patients (despi[INVESTIGATOR_634760]) 
who are more likely or less likely to either respond or to experience ad verse events  based 
on: 
Starting platelet counts, splenectomy status, con comitant meds e .g, daily prednisone at a 
maximum dose of 20mg daily, duration of ITP  since diagnosis , starting Hemoglobin , 
WBC,   and Absolute Neutrophil Count ( ANC ), starting ALTs ,  bilirubins or Alk Phos 
levels, Platelet Reticulocyte Count .  
 
3. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
3.1. Study Design  
Double -blind, randomized, placebo -controlled trial in subjects with ITP who are ‘non -
responders’ at the maximum package insert dose (75mg) of eltrombopag ; non -responders 
are those with platelet counts < 50,000 despi[INVESTIGATOR_634761] 75 mg/day of eltrombopag for at 
least 3 weeks .

Informed consent and assent of minors will be obtained by [CONTACT_634779]-investig ators. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], informed consent/minor assent will be obtained in the 
outpatient clinic,  although  inpatients may have this discussed with them as well.  Consent 
will be obtained after review of clinical information and satisfaction of eligibility criteri a. 
Subjects  will be randomly allocated at a two to one ratio to receive active treatment or 
placebo. All subjects  must be >[ADDRESS_847698]’s platelet count is <50,000, the subject may begin day 1 of the study. Subjects  and 
investigators will be blinded to assignment and treatment in this phase . Eltrombopag  will 
be administered for 8 weeks or until the platelet count exceeds  100,000 ; at this point 
dosing will stop, subject  will be considered a responder and the subject  will eligible for 
entering Part  2 (the long term treatment part of the study) if desired and agreed to be 
appropriate by [CONTACT_634780] , and the treating physician. The dose at which 
the subject achieved  the primary endpoint  (> 50,000 an d increase by > 20,000)  will be 
considered the dose of response . Even if a patient achieves a response, if the platelet 
counts remains < 100,000 , then the dose escalation schema in the figure above will 
continue.  
 
Dose escalation will continue , despi[INVESTIGATOR_634762]  (> 
50,000 and > 20,000 above baseline),  until the platelet count reaches  100,[ADDRESS_847699] s 
and standardize data for analysis. Sub jects will stop study medication if the platelet count 
is within the normal range, thereby [CONTACT_634781] . By [CONTACT_634782] > 
100,000 , the maximum respo nse and correlation of dose will be tracked allowing better 
understanding of sustained response and dose -dependent response , which can be applied 
to future consideration dosage for periods of short -term hemostasis ( i.e surgical 
procedures). The 8 weeks of  data collected in enrolled subjects on the standardized

for study visits. All study -required procedures will be faxed to the P -I for review . The 
appropriate dosing adjustments will be determined by [CONTACT_941] P -I. 
 
  
According to the new consensus guidelines (Provan Blood, 2009), male and female 
subject s with > 1 year duration of ITP  are diagnosed with chronic ITP. Enrollment began 
with adult subjects ≥ 18 years of age, and was extend ed to include pediatric patients > 12 
years of age after a review of this unblinded safety information by  [CONTACT_634783] (DMSO) . Additionally, we will now allow the inclusion of 
pediatric pat ients > 3 year of age to enroll on the protoco l. The rationale for treating 
patients  on this study is to allow people to be successfully treated and thus increase their 
platelet count by [CONTACT_2329] a higher dose of eltrombopag when they do not respond to 75 mg 
daily of eltrombopag. Since some children do not respond to 75mg, the rationale and the 
dosing (when and how to increase) would be the same.

subjects  randomized to placebo would have a response. The same statistical test will be 
run for subjects who achieve partial response.  An interim analysis w as performed after [ADDRESS_847707] for futilit y and efficacy.  
 
Dose modification during the long term extension portion of the trial will be made on 
the basis of individual platelet response to a maximal dose of 150mg . All subjects can 
be monitor ed at  4 weeks  intervals  and then can go to every 8 weeks  for the remainder 
of the study  at the discretion of the investigator   (investigator may require subjects to 
come in for additional monitoring if deemed necessary).

this may occur include, but are not limited to:  investigator is tapering other 
medications or the subject has a viral infection . Viral infections have been known to 
both increase and decrease platelet count in patients with ITP. It is suggested that the 
increased presence of inflammatory molecules during a viral infection increases 
platelet production, causing platelet count to increase . Alternatively, platelet count 
may decrease by v irtue of activating the reticuloendthelial system causing greater 
phagocytosis of antibody -coated platelets and/or platelet production.

For uniformity of dosing and data analysis and for better understandin g of increased dose 
effects, patients randomized to the treatment arm will automatically take : 
  100 mg for 2 weeks  
125 mg for 2 weeks  
150 mg for 4 weeks  
 
However, if the platelet count increases to ≥ 100,000 /uL, study drug will be interrupted 
and will not be resumed until platelet count is below 100,000  /uL and the patient desires 
to enroll on the Part 2 long term treatment  extension study . The patient will finish with 
the Part 1 of the study at this point but can enter Part 2 the long ter m treatment ex tension  
study at dose at which the patient met primary response criteria , after the platelet count 
decreases to < 100,000 /uL on serial immediate post-study monitoring period . 
 
Rescue treatment will be defined as new treatment for chronic ITP eg  IV anti -D or IVIG, 
an increased dose of steroids , or platelet transfusion.  Use of rescue treatments will be 
allowed, but patients will be regarded as non -responders for the duration of rescue 
treatment and until 2 weeks beyond.

6.4. Safety  
Increased Liver Chemistries  
 
Eltrombopag ad ministration may cause hepatotoxicity. In the ITP controlled clinical 
studies, one patient experienced Grade 4 (NCI Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events [NCI CTCAE] toxicity scale) elevations in serum liver test values during 
therapy with Eltromb opag, worsening of underlying cardiopulmonary disease, and death. 
One patient in the placebo group experienced a Grade [ADDRESS_847720] abnormalities 
(predominantly Grade 2 or less in severity) were reported in 11% and 7% of the 
eltrombopag and placebo groups, respectively. In the three controlled studies, four 
patients (1%) treated with eltro mbopag and three patients in the placebo group (2%) 
discontinued treatment due to hepatobiliary laboratory abnormalities. Seven of the 
patients treated with eltrombopag in the controlled studies with hepatobiliary laboratory 
abnormalities were re -exposed t o eltrombopag in the ITP extension study. Six of these 
patients again experienced liver test abnormalities (predominantly Grade 1) resulting in 
discontinuation of eltrombopag in one patient. In the ITP extension study, one additional 
patient had eltrombopa g discontinued due to liver test abnormalities (all 
 Grade 3).  
Liver chemistry stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_634769] – Drug -Induced Liver Injury: Premarketing Clinical Evaluation 
(July 2009, www.fda.gov ). 
  
Bone Marrow Reticulin Formation and Risk for Bone Marrow Fibrosis  
Eltrombopag may increase the risk for the development or progression of  reticulin fiber 
deposition within the bone marrow.  
  IRB # [PHONE_13216]  
  [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
Document date here : 10-13-[ADDRESS_847721] had bone marrow biopsies evaluated for 
increased reticulin and collagen fiber deposition. Bone marrow biopsies taken after 1 year 
of therapy showed predomina ntly myelofibrosis (MF) Grade 1 or less in 140/151 (93%) 
of patients  (Saleh et al 2013, Blood) . There were 11/151 (7%) of patients with MF Grade 
2. Four patients had collagen deposition reported. One patient with a pre -existing MF 
Grade [ADDRESS_847722] not yet excluded a risk of bone marrow fibrosis with  
clinical consequences.  .  
If new or worsening blood morphological abnormalities or cytopenias occur, a bone 
marrow b iopsy should be considered, including staining for fibrosis..  
Thrombotic/thromboembolic complications  
Thrombotic/thromboembolic complications may result from increases in platelet counts 
with eltrombopaand those reported in controlled clinical studies in  patients with chronic 
ITP included both venous and arterial events and were observed at low and normal 
platelet counts.  
Use caution when administering eltrombopag to patients with known risk factors for 
thromboembolism (e.g., Factor V Leiden, ATIII defici ency, antiphospholipid syndrome, 
chronic liver disease). To minimize the risk for thrombotic/thromboembolic 
complications, do not use eltrombopag in an attempt to normalize platelet counts. Follow 
the dose adjustment guidelines to achieve and maintain a pl atelet count of 
 50 x 109/L 
as necessary to decrease the risk for bleeding  
In a placebo -controlled double -blind study (ELEVATE) of 292 patients with chronic 
liver disease who were undergoing an elective  surgical procedure, the risk of portal 
venous thromb osis was increased in patients treated with 75 mg eltrombopag once daily 
for 2 weeks in preparation for their invasive procedure. Seven thrombotic complications 
(six patients) were reported within the group that received eltrombopag and three 
thrombotic co mplications were reported in the placebo group (two patients). All of the 
thrombotic complications reported within the eltrombopag group were of the portal 
venous system. Five of the six patients in the group that received eltrombopag 
experienced a thrombo tic complication within 30 days of completing treatment with 
eltrombopag and at a platelet count above 200 x 109/L. Malignancy is known to increase 
the risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a thrombotic event and four  of the 6 patients either had a 
diagnosis or suspi[INVESTIGATOR_2798] o f malignancy (2 hepatocellular carcinoma; 1 possible lymphoma 
and 1 brain tumor).     
Caution should be exercised when administering eltrombopag to patients with hepatic 
impairment (Child -Pugh Class A, B, C) and  a lower starting dose of eltrombopag should  
be used in patients with any degree of hepatic impairment.  Such patients should be 
monitored very closely. Eltrombopag is not indicated for the treatment of 
thrombocytopenia in patients with chronic liver disease.  
The ELEVATE study was terminated in Nove mber 2009 and a Dear Health Care 
Professional Letter (DHCPL) was sent to all physicians enrolled in Promacta Cares in 
May 2010.

 Hematologic Malignancies  
Stimulation of the TPO receptor on the surface of hematopoietic cells by [CONTACT_634784] e risk for hematologic malignancies. In the controlled clinical studies, 
patients were treated with eltrombopag for a maximum of 6 months. During this period 
no hematologic malignancies were reported in patients treated with eltrombopag. One 
hematologic ma lignancy (non -Hodgkin's lymphoma) was reported in the extension study.  
Eltrombopag is not indicated for the treatment of thrombocytopenia due to diseases or 
treatments that cause thrombocytopenia (e.g., myelodysplasia or chemotherapy) other 
than chronic IT P.  
Cataracts  
Cataracts were observed in toxicology studies of eltrombopag in rodents (see Non -
clinical Information). To date, there is however, no evidence that eltrombopag increases 
the incidence nor progression of cataracts in patients who have received  eltrombopag.  In 
the three placebo -controlled ITP studies, 7% of patients in both the placebo and 
eltrombopag treatment groups had a report of cataract.  A significant proportion of 
patients in the ITP clinical studies were also exposed to chronic cortico steroid 
administration.   
Routine monitoring of patients for cataracts is recommended. Patients treated with 
eltrombopag who experience visual difficulties should have an appropriate 
ophthalmologic evaluation

 Fractionate bilirubin, if total bilirubin >2x ULN.  
 Obtain complete blood count with differential to assess eosinophilia.  
 Record the appearance or worsening of clinical symptoms of hepatitis, or 
hypersens itivity, such as fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant pain or 
tenderness, fever, rash or eosinophilia as relevant on the AE form.  
 Record use of concomitant medications, acetaminophen, herbal remedies, other 
over the counter medications, or putat ive hepatotoxins, on the concomitant 
medications form.  
 Record alcohol use on the liver event alcohol intake form.  
 
The following assessments are required for subjects with ALT >3x ULN and bilirubin  
>2x ULN (>35% direct) but are optional for other abnormal liver chemistries:  
 Anti-nuclear antibody, anti -smooth muscle antibody, and Type 1 anti -liver kidney 
microsomal antibodies  
 Liver imaging (ultrasound, magnetic resonance, or computerized tomography) to 
evaluate liver disease.  
Liver Chemistry Monitoring Crite ria 
For subjects with ALT >3x ULN but <5x ULN and bilirubin <2x ULN, without hepatitis 
symptoms or rash, and who can be monitored weekly for 4 weeks, the following actions

 should be taken:  
 Notify [COMPANY_001] and DSMB within [ADDRESS_847730] safety  
 Can continue study treatment  
 Must return weekly for repeat liver chemistries (ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, 
bilirubin) until they resolve, stabilize or return to within baseline values  
 If at any time the subject meets any o f the liver chemistry stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3418] 1 – 5, 
proceed as described above  
 If, after 4 weeks of monitoring, ALT <3x ULN and bilirubin <2x ULN, monitor 
subjects twice monthly until liver chemistries normalize or return to within 
baseline values.  
 
Protocol St oppi[INVESTIGATOR_634775]. Early 
termination may occur due to emergent risk information or the decision by [CONTACT_634785] E ltrombopag.  
 
Dose Escalation Rules  
 
In Pa rt 1 of the study , subjects will be randomly allocated at a two to one ratio to receive 
active treatment or  placebo. All subjects in the study will receive 75 mg eltrombopag and 
then be  randomized to receive either an additional 25 mg of eltrombopag or mat ching 
placebo  tablet dispensed by [CONTACT_56636].  
 
Eltrombopag will be administered bi -weekly for 8 weeks. If platelet count does not 
exceed 100,000, the additional eltrombopag or matching placebo tablet will be increased 
by 25 mg until the patient receives 75 mg eltrombopag and 75 mg eltrombopag or 
matching placebo (100mg x 2 weeks, 125 mg x 2 weeks, 150 x 4 weeks).  If the patient’s 
platelet count exceeds 100,[ADDRESS_847731]  will eligible for entering Part 2 (the long term treatment part of 
the study).  
 
Dose modification during the long term extension portion of the trial will be made on  
the basis of individual platelet response to a s high a  dose as  150mg.  If the platelet c ount 
is > 150,000 ul and < 400,00 ul the daily dose will be adjusted and if > 400,[ADDRESS_847732]’s dose will negatively affect the subject, he or sh e may decide not to 
escalate, reduce , or stop  the subject’s dose. Circumstances in which this may occur 
include, but are not limited to: investigator is tapering other medications or the subject 
has a viral infection. Viral infections have been known to both increase and decrease 
platelet count in patients with ITP. It is suggested that the increased presence of 
inflammatory molecules during a viral infection increases platelet prod uction, causing 
platelet count to increase. Alternatively, platelet count may decrease by [CONTACT_634786] -coated 
platelets  and/or platelet production.

Data Collection and Monitori ng 
Data will be collected and entered into a Microsoft excel eCRF by [CONTACT_132061]. Data will be entered into the eCRF after each study visit. The Principal 
investigator [INVESTIGATOR_634776] a nd entered is 
accurate.  
Interim Analysis:  
An interim analysis was performed after [ADDRESS_847733]  
a higher complete response rate compared to females. Of note, three subjects were 
removed due to SAEs, however only  one patient was removed because of a study drug 
related event (elevated LFTs). Further analysis will be performed to evaluate the lo ng 
term efficacy and safety of E ltrombopag at doses higher  than [ADDRESS_847734] protected. The FDA, [LOCATION_001] 
Presby[CONTACT_24021][INVESTIGATOR_307], the IRB, and the Office for Human Research Protection (OHRP) 
may have access to the study records without the patient’s permission  and will maintain 
confidentially of the information.  
 
8. DATA ANALYSIS AND ST ATISTICAL CONSIDERAT IONS  
8.1. Hypotheses  
Subject who did  not respond at a dose of 75mg daily, eltrombopag will respond with 
increasing platelet count to > 50,000 and > 20,[ADDRESS_847735] a 80 % statistical power at the 5% level of significance  (two sided) to 
detect a difference in the proportion of patient receiving increased dose of eltrombopag 
with a primary response ( Platelet Count ≥ 50,000 per cubic millimetre and > 20,000 
above baseline ) to patients without a primary response in the placebo group. assuming 
50% of patients randomized to active drug will have a response and 5% of patients 
  IRB # [PHONE_13216]  
  [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
Document date here : 10-13-[ADDRESS_847736] at the interim analysis the sample size would be allowed to 
expand to up to 60 subjects  
8.2.2.  Sample Size Sensitivity  / Re-estimation  
If the estimates of study size are incorrect, a preliminary look will take place after 18 
patients to see if the study size needs to be increased.  
8.3. Data Analysis Considerations  
8.3.1.  Key Elements of Ana lysis Plan  
The analysis would primarily be descriptive except for the primary endpoint. In order to 
make the study feasible, the current plan for 36 patients does not allow for much 
flexibility. It does allow for a confirmatory study from the patients on placebo who can 
then follow the 8 weeks of dose escalation treatment as an open label study (note they 
will have been on [ADDRESS_847737] 11 weeks at that time).  All 
secondary analyses will be underpowered but will be descriptive.   
Analys is of efficacy will be based on the intention to treat population of all subjects who 
underwent randomization.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Interim analysis  
Results of Interim analysis:  
 
In the interim analysis of [ADDRESS_847738]  a higher complete response rate compar ed 
to females.  
 
Of note, three subjects were removed due to SAEs, however only one patient was 
removed because of a study drug related event (elevated LFTs). Further analysis will be 
performed  after 36 patients and 60 patients are enrolled  to evaluate the  long term efficacy 
and safety of eltrombopag at doses higher than 75 mg.  
 
Primary Response Criteria:  
 
Complete Response (CR) will be defined as a 2 consecutive platelet counts ≥ 50,000 /uL  
AND  > 20,000 more than the baseline platelet count  at enrollmen t within the 8 week 
increased dose window not as a result of rescue treatment. Partial Response (PR) will be 
defined as a 2 consecutive platelet counts ≥ 50,000 /uL  OR  > 20,000 more than the 
baseline platelet count  at enrollment within the 8 week increa sed dose window not as a 
result of rescue treatment. Odds of response will be analyzed using logistical regression 
for binary response variables.

PHARMACOKINETIC SAMP LING  
PK Sample Collection  
After a minimum of 4 weeks on active study drug, 2mL blood samples for PK analysis will be 
collected in K2 EDTA -containing tubes .  One sample will be collected at each of the following 
times: within 1 hour prior to eltrombopag dosing (pre -dose sample), and at [ADDRESS_847745] the date, time, and amount (in mg) of the dose administered prior to the pre -dose sample 
(this dose should have been taken on a day prior to PK sample collection), and record the 
dosing frequency (for  example: once daily).  
Record the date, time, and amount (in mg) of the dose administered after the pre -dose PK sample 
(this dose should be administered within a few minutes after collecting the pre -dose PK 
sample).  
Collect each whole blood PK sample as cl ose as possible to the planned time relative to dosing.  
Record the actual date and time that each sample was collected.  
If a cannula is used, the cannula will be inserted into an arm vein within sufficient time prior to 
dosing, will be kept patent with no rmal saline and will be removed after the last blood sample is 
collected or earlier if the subject requests.  In order to avoid artificial dilution of the PK sample 
by [CONTACT_218091], 0.5 -1mL of whole blood will be collected and discarded before each PK sample  is 
collected.  
PK Sample Processing and Storage  
Each PK samples will be gently mixed by [CONTACT_8536] 8 to 10 times (do not shake).  Place the 
samples on ice immediately after collection.  Within 1 hour of sample collection, the samples will 
be centrifuged in a refrigerated (2°C to 8°C) centrifuge at [ADDRESS_847746] the plasma samples upright in a -20°C freezer and retain the samples in the freezer  until 
they are shipped for analysis.  
PK Sample Shipment  
Samples should be shipped in batches, no less than every [ADDRESS_847747] be 
shipped on dry ice via overnight courier to:

Title: Randomized  Placebo-Controlled, Double-Blind Study Of Cholecalciferol Replacement in 
Patients on Expectant Management for Localized Prostate Cancer
Objectives:
Primary Objective
1) To  determine PSA response with oral high dose vitamin D3 supplementation in patients with 
localized, histologically proven adenocarcinoma of the prostate that have not received any 
treatment for prostate cancer ever and have chosen expectant management.
 Secondary Objectives
1) To  examine the pattern of response of PSA dynamics as well as the absolute change in PSA 
following vitamin D3 supplementation.
2) Assess the toxicity of vitamin D3 supplementation in men with prostate cancer.
Exploratory Objectives
1) Track  occurrence of infections, deep venous thrombosis, vascular events and falls in the study 
population.
2) To  evaluate relationship between CYP24, 27B1, SNPs and serum 25(OH) vitamin D response 
to oral D3 supplementation.
Study Design : Double-blinded, parallel, placebo controlled randomized 2-group complete cross-
over design with 12  week washout period. 103 patients are expected to enroll over 11 year 
period.
Treatment Plan: Eligible men will be randomly assigned to two groups in 1:1 ratio.
Group A  will receive 6,000 IU daily of vitamin D3 provided as 3 capsules of 2000 IU each.
Group B  will receive a placebo provided as 3 capsules of a rice based placebo.
Treatment Duration : Participants will be followed for 36 weeks and then crossed over after a 
wash out period of 12 weeks and followed for another 36 weeks.
Number of  Participants: Each group will be comprised of approximately 50 men. Those who 
are not able to complete the study will be replaced.

1). If a  participant's 25(OH) D3 level reaches > 200ng/ml with 6000 IU or 3 capsules a day, or 
any >grade 3 toxicity possibly related to cholecalciferol develops, 25(OH) D3 or placebo will be 
discontinued for  4 weeks. Treatment will then be resumed at lower dose of 4000 IU or 2 capsules 
a day. If a participant misses some period of time off the study drug, the treatment would be 
resumed such that the participant completes a total of 36 weeks on the study drug.
2). If  a participant's 25(OH) D3 level reaches > 200ng/ml with the lower dose modification of 
4000 IU or 2 capsules a day, or any grade 3 toxicity develops, 25(OH) D3 or placebo will be 
discontinued for  4 weeks. Treatment will then be resumed at lower dose of 2000 IU or 1 capsule 
a day.
3). If a  participant's 25(OH) D3 level reaches > 200ng/ml with the lower dose modification 
of 2000 IU or 1 capsule a day, or any grade 3 toxicity develops, the participant will then be taken 
off study.
4). Participants  that drop out after the first treatment period (36 weeks) will be included in the 
analysis but will require enrolling additional participants such that we have evaluable data on 
100 participant-periods. An intention to treat analysis will be done.
5). If participant  misses a daily dose of vitamin D3, or placebo, he should skip it and continue to 
take it as scheduled the following day. The participant should write down the day of the missed 
dose in the diary and should bring the diary with him on the day of physical. If participant misses 
more than 1/3 rd of the doses in 12 week interval, the participant will be taken out of the study 
and will be replaced by [CONTACT_85544].
6). At  the end of study, participants may choose to continue taking vitamin D3 replacement per 
personal preferences.
Major Entry Criteria:

1.[ADDRESS_746057] common cause of cancer related deaths. It is estimated that 218,890 men will be diagnosed 
with and 27,050 men will die of prostate cancer in [ZIP_CODE] . Many patients are diagnosed with 
prostate cancer based on a screening prostate specific antigen (PSA) test.2 In some patients, an 
abnormal PSA is the only indication of prostate cancer (stage T1c). Localized prostate cancer is 
usually treated with either surgery or radiation.3 4 The necessity of definitive therapi[INVESTIGATOR_569044] a “watchful waiting” approach for 
their localized disease due to the morbidity sometimes associated with irradiation or 
prostatectomy. There is limited evidence for improved quality or quantity of survival in certain 
population (e.g. elderly men, men with substantial comorbidities).5 Expectant management 
(observation, active surveillance, watchful waiting) is a reasonable option in many situations.[ADDRESS_746058] regular follow 
up as suggested by 2007 updated NCCN guidelines with DRE and PSA every 6 months for life 
expectancy greater than or equal to 10 years and every 6-12 mo for life expectancy < 10 years. 
Needle biopsy of the prostate may be repeated within 6 months of diagnosis if initial biopsy was 
< 10 cores or assessment discordant (e.g. palpable tumor contralateral to side of positive biopsy). 
Needle biopsy may be performed within 18 months if > [ADDRESS_746059] occurred if any of the following is noted: Gleason grade 4 or 5 
cancer is found upon repeat prostate biopsy; prostate cancer is found in a greater number of 
prostate biopsies or occupi[INVESTIGATOR_014] a greater extent of prostate biopsies; PSA doubling time < 3 y or 
PSA velocity is > 0.75; a repeat prostate biopsy is indicated for signs of disease progression by 
[CONTACT_569053].
Advantages of expectant management:
Avoid  possible side effects of definitive therapy that may be unnecessary
Quality  of life/normal activities retained
Risk  of unnecessary treatment of small, indolent cancers is reduced
Disadvantages of expectant management:
Chance  of missed opportunity for cure
Risk  of progression and/or metastases
Subsequent  treatment may be more intense with increased side effects
Increased  anxiety
Requires  frequent medical exams and periodic biopsies
Uncertain  long term natural history of prostate cancer

addition, a rapid PSA change (expressed as PSA velocity [PSAV] or PSA doubling time 
[PSADT]) was shown to correlate with the presence of cancer and metastatic disease. PSAV is 
defined as rate of change in PSA over a predefined period of time.[ADDRESS_746061] powerful indicator of clinical 
progression in 113 men observed expectantly; whereas, T classification, histologic grade, and 
initial levels of PSA were not important.18 D’Amico et al reported that a PSAV greater than 2 
ng/ml per year was associated with greater prostate cancer-specific mortality following radical 
prostatectomy and external beam radiation therapy.19 20
PSA slope  is defined as the slope of the linear line of log 2 (PSA) versus time. The advantage to 
this transformation is the inverse of the slope is the time to doubling the PSA value. 21 22 
Following PSA dynamics can help guide treatment strategy in patients who choose expectant 
management.
1.3 Prostate Cancer and Vitamin D
Multiple studies  demonstrate links between vitamin D deficiency and prostate cancer.23 24 25 26 27 
28 29 . 
1.3.1 Vitamin D analogues and in vivo and in vitro growth of prostate cancer:
In preclinical  studies, 1, 25 dihydroxyvitaminD3 [calcitriol; 1α,25(OH) 2D3] has been shown to 
be effective in killing prostate cancer cells 30 31 32 33 34 35 36. 1α,25(OH) 2D3-induces cell-cycle 
arrest of LNCaP cell in the G0–G1 phase involves decreased phosphorylation of the 
retinoblastoma gene-encoded protein (Rb). This is followed by a reduction in the activity of the 
transcription factor, which leads to increased activity of p21waf1, and decreased CDK2 activity. 
Blutt et al.  observed apoptosis after treating LNCaP cells with 1α,25(OH) 2D3 accompanied by 
[CONTACT_569054]-apoptotic proteins, Bcl2 and BclX L, and is prevented by 
[CONTACT_569055]2. Other anti-apoptotic proteins (Mcl-1, BAG1L, 
XIAP, cIAP1 and cIAP2) are also down regulated by 1α, 25(OH) 2D3 in LNCaP cells but 
proapoptotic Bax and Bak are unaltered . This down regulation leads to the activation of caspase-
[ADDRESS_746062] and apoptosis are involved in growth regulation of LNCaP cells in response to 1α, 
25(OH) 2D3. Studies have also implicated the increased expression of insulin-like growth factor 
binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) in the growth inhibition induced by [CONTACT_569056] p21Waf/Cip1 expression. Other mechanisms of calcitriol actions in PCa cells include the 
stimulation of differentiation, modulation of growth factor actions and the inhibition of invasion, 
metastasis and angiogenesis.
Similar anti-proliferative effects are seen in vivo in many human, mouse and rat models.37

 04/19/18 Page  9 of 311.3.2. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_569045] D levels and prostate cancer:
There appears  to be an inverse correlation between the mortality rate of prostate cancer and 
exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UVR) in the US population. An association between vitamin D 
deficiency and prostate cancer was reported by [CONTACT_569057]. in a 13-year follow-up of 19 000 
middle-aged men in the Helsinki Heart Study. 27 In this study, 149 cases of prostate cancer were 
identified and matched to 566 sample controls. The study showed that low circulating levels of 
25(OH) D3 (<40 nmol l−1 or 16 ng ml−1) were associated with an increased risk of subsequent 
earlier onset and more aggressive progression of prostate cancer, especially before the age of 52.
UVR exposure  has a significant protective effect in prostate cancer.[ADDRESS_746063] quartile of sun exposure developed cancer at a median age of 
67.7 years compared with 72.1 years in patients in other quartiles.39 Although the mechanism of 
this association is unclear, it is possible that increased cutaneous synthesis of vitamin D 3 
increases the circulating levels of 25(OH) D3 and the subsequent formation of 1α, 25(OH) 2D3 in 
the prostate by [CONTACT_569058] 1α-OHase (20). 1α, 25(OH) 2D3 then interacts with VDR in the prostate 
and induces cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis-suppressing cancer development .[ADDRESS_746064] a greater risk of prostate cancer and other 
cancers.43 The greater risk of prostate cancer in Afro-Caribbean men indicates that one factor 
contributing to the genesis of prostate cancer might be vitamin D insufficiency.44
1.3.3 Clinical Data:
Limited but  intriguing clinical data suggest 1α,25(OH) 2D3 alone or in combination with other 
agents may slow PSA rise in men with either androgen stimulated or castration resistant prostate 
cancer patients. 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 NCCN guideline--
We  have reported an approximately 25% response rate (PSA) in men with castration 
resistant prostate cancer using a regimen of 12mcg calcitriol 3X/week [MTW] + 
dexamethasone [4mg SMTW].54 
Gross  et al using calcitriol and Vieth et al using cholecalciferol showed slowing of PSA 
increase in patients with androgen stimulated prostate cancer. 46 55 
Vieth  et al noted that the rate of rise in PSA is slower during the spring-summer than 
during the rest of the year, in men who had been followed on an expectant management 
protocol with selective delayed intervention for clinically localized, low-to-intermediate

 04/19/18 Page  10 of 311.4 Vitamin D Supplementation and Toxicity
Supplementation with vitamin  D has been studied in normal individuals and those with 
vitamin D deficiency. Recommended daily allowance of vitamin D is 400 IU. Considerable 
data suggests this may be inadequate to bring and maintain serum vitamin D levels in normal 
range.[Hollis et al] The currently accepted normal range of 25(OH) D3 is 32-100ng/mL 
[ng/ml X 2.5 
  nmol/L].  Supplementation with 10 µg (400 IU) of vitamin D raises 25(OH) D 
by [INVESTIGATOR_13701] 
 0.45 nmol/(L μg day).
Various  studies report that one minimal erythema dose( Exposure of the body in a 
bathing suit to sunlight that causes a minimum redness to the skin) of UV-B radiation to 
the whole body produces between 10,000 and 25,000 IU (250 and 625 μg) of 
cholecalciferol and is safe. 57 Indeed, a continuing daily oral intake of 10,000 IU 
produces a mean serum 25OHD value approximating what is seen naturally after 
extensive summer sun exposure at mid latitudes.58
All  instances of vitamin D toxicity have involved serum 25(OH) D concentrations more 
than 250nmol/L, a value that would be produced only at continuing oral intakes in excess 
of 10,000IU (250microg)/day.59
To  attain a steady state of equilibrium in serum Vitamin D level, at least [ADDRESS_746066] a change in vitamin D supplementation dose.60 The graph below depi[INVESTIGATOR_569046] D supplementation. 61
The  serum 25 (OH) D concentrations is maintained within a narrow range 
 75–220 
nmol/L
 across a wide range of D3 intake: 20 µg (800 IU) to 500 µg ([ZIP_CODE] IU)/d. The 
following graph clearly demonstrates that it is very safe to treat patients with vitamin D 
up to dosage of 10,000 IU-especially if 25(OH)D3 levels are monitored. 56 The serum 
levels appear to plateau between 120-130 nmol/L. Several studies have demonstrated the 
essential safety of continuous daily dosing with 4000, 5000 and 10,000 IU/day (100, 125 
and 250 μg/day)  for up to 16 weeks, and of 50,000 IU (1250 μg)/day for 8 weeks, all

 04/19/18 Page  19 of 3110.0 SAFETY EVALUATION
10.1 Adverse Events
An adverse  event or adverse experience (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence 
associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related. 
Therefore, an AE can be ANY unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a 
medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal 
(investigational) product (attribution of ‘unrelated’, ‘unlikely’, ‘possible’, ‘probable’, or 
‘definite’).
An AE  is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in the investigator brochure or is not 
listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed; or if an investigator brochure is 
not required or available, is not consistent with the risk information described in the 
general investigational plan in other study-related documents.
10.1.1 Diagnosis Versus Signs and Symptoms
If known,  a diagnosis should be recorded on the CRF rather than individual signs and 
symptoms (e.g., record only liver failure or hepatitis rather than jaundice, asterixis, and 
elevated transaminases). However, if a constellation of signs and/or symptoms cannot be 
clinically characterized as a single diagnosis or syndrome at the time of reporting, each 
individual event should be recorded as an AE or SAE on the CRF. If a diagnosis is 
subsequently established, it should be reported as follow-up information.
10.1.2 Adverse Events Occurring Secondary to Other Events
In general, AEs  occurring secondary to other events (e.g., cascade events or clinical 
sequelae) should be identified by [CONTACT_5252]. For example, if severe diarrhea is 
known to have resulted in dehydration, it is sufficient to record only diarrhea as an AE or 
SAE on the CRF. 
However, clinically significant AEs occurring secondary to an initiating event that are 
separated in time should be recorded as independent events on the CRF. For example, if a 
severe gastrointestinal hemorrhage leads to renal failure, both events should be recorded 
separately on the CRF.
10.1.3 Abnormal Laboratory Values
Only clinically  significant laboratory abnormalities that require active management will 
be recorded as AEs or SAEs on the CRF (e.g., abnormalities that require study drug dose 
modification, discontinuation of study treatment, more frequent follow-up assessments, 
further diagnostic investigation, etc.).
If the clinically  significant laboratory abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome 
(e.g., alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin 5 x the upper limit of normal associated with 
cholecystitis), only the diagnosis (e.g., cholecystitis) needs to be recorded on the Adverse 
Event CRF.
If the clinically  significant laboratory abnormality is not a sign of a disease or syndrome, 
the abnormality itself should be recorded as an AE or SAE on the CRF. If the laboratory 
APPROVED RPCI IRB
4/26/2018
I 128308 AMD # 17
 04/19/18 Page  20 of 31abnormality can  be characterized by a precise clinical term, the clinical term should be 
recorded as the AE or SAE. For example, an elevated serum potassium level of 7 mEq/L 
should be recorded as “hyperkalemia”.
Observations of  the same clinically significant laboratory abnormality from visit to visit 
should not be repeatedly recorded as AEs or SAEs on the CRF, unless their severity, 
seriousness, or etiology changes.
10.1.4 Preexisting Medical Conditions (Baseline Conditions)
A preexisting  medical condition should be recorded as an AE or SAE only if the 
frequency, severity, or character of the condition worsens during the study. When 
recording such events on an Adverse Event CRF, it is important to convey the concept 
that the preexisting condition has changed by [CONTACT_9672] 
(e.g., “more frequent headaches”).
10.2 Grading and Reporting Adverse Events
10.2.1 Grading and Relationship to Drug
The descriptions  and grading scales found in the CTEP Version 5.0 of the NCI Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) will be utilized for AE reporting. 
CTEP Version 5.0 of the CTCAE is identified and located at:
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm.
AEs not  covered by [CONTACT_248289], and documented according to the grading scales provided in the CTCAE 
Version 5.0.
The relationship  of event to study drug will be documented by [CONTACT_569066]:
Unrelated:  The event is clearly related to other factors such as the participant’s 
clinical state, other therapeutic interventions or concomitant drugs administered to 
the participant.
Unlikely:  The event is doubtfully related to investigational agent(s). The event 
was most likely related to other factors such as the participant’s clinical state, 
other therapeutic interventions, or concomitant drugs.
Possible:  The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of 
drug administration, but could have been produced by [CONTACT_569067]’s clinical state, other therapeutic interventions or concomitant drugs.
Probable:  The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of 
drug administration, and follows a known response pattern to the study drug. The 
event cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_248290]’s 
clinical state, therapeutic interventions or concomitant drugs.
Definite:  The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of drug 
administration, follows a known response pattern to the study drug, cannot be 
reasonably explained by [CONTACT_248290]’s condition,

10.6 Unanticipated Problems
An Unanticipated  Problem (UP) is any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of 
the following criteria:
Unexpected  (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency) given:
a. The  research procedures that are described in the study-related documents, 
including study deviations, as well as issues related to compromise of 
participant privacy or confidentiality of data.
b. The  characteristics of the participant population being studied.
Related  or possibly related to participation in the research (possibly related means 
there is a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may 
have been caused by [CONTACT_3459]).
Suggests  that the research places participants or others at a greater risk of harm 
(including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously 
known or recognized and if in relation to an AE is also deemed Serious per 
Section 17.4.

Office within 1 business day of becoming aware of the Unanticipated Problem. After 
review, CRS Compliance will submit the RNI to the IRB.
When becoming  aware of new information about an Unanticipated Problem, submit the 
updated information to CRS Compliance with an updated Reportable New Information 
Form. The site Investigator or designated research personnel will report all unanticipated 
problems to the IRB in accordance with their local institutional guidelines.
10.7 Data Safety and Monitoring
If any  literature becomes available which suggests that conducting this trial is no longer 
ethical, the study will be terminated and the IRB will be notified of the new findings. The 
IRB will be notified of any change in the risk/benefit ratio that would affect whether the 
study should continue. All serious adverse events will be reported to the IRB according to 
the established guidelines. A cumulative summary of all adverse events occurring on this 
study will also be submitted to the IRB at six months review. Toxicity is reported, as 
required, to the FDA. All study data reviewed and discussed during these meetings will 
be kept confidential. Any breech in participant confidentiality will be reported to the IRB.
11. Statistical Analysis
Power analysis:
A 2x2  cross-over design with total sample size 100 achieves approximately 80% power 
to detect 0.[ADDRESS_746082] size (the relative magnitude of the effect under the alternative) at 
significance level 0.05. In other words, assuming the Log 2(PSA) slope prior to therapy is 
0.7 ng/ml/yr. with a standard deviation as 0.7 (based on statistical evaluation of data 
provided by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Vieth from his trial of cholecalciferol replacement in men with PSA 
rising after local therapy. [ADDRESS_746083] a 50% reduction of PSA doubling 
time. 71 
Statistical analysis plan:
This is  2 by 2 cross over trial. To address the research objectives, we want to pool 
information across periods by [CONTACT_569068]. The Log 2(PSA) will be analyzed by [CONTACT_569069] (1 for vitamin D3, 2 for control), period ([ADDRESS_746084]  36 weeks and 2 for second  36 weeks), time (as a continuous variable), time and 
period interaction, and a variable indicating carry-over effect (1 if the previous treatment 
assignment is vitamin D3, 2 if the previous treatment assignment is control). The random 
effect includes random intercept and slope (and a quadratic term if necessary). The 
significance in the difference between PSA responses for vitamin D3 group and control 
groups will be assessed by [CONTACT_569070] t tests. This will be done using SAS PROC 
MIXED (SAS 9.1.3., SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, [LOCATION_003]). The pattern of response of 
PSA dynamics as well as the absolute change in PSA following vitamin D3 
supplementation will be analyzed similarly using the mixed model approach.

who have 3 or more PSA values from the same laboratory over a period of  18 months or 
more prior to enrollment, PSA velocity (PSAV) will be calculated and compared to a 
PSA velocity obtained by [CONTACT_569071]'s during the 2 periods of investigation on 
the study (the  36 weeks on placebo and the  36 weeks on treatment). Specifically, PSAV 
can be analyzed as a summary statistics as follows: PSAV will be calculated for the pre-
study period, the first [ADDRESS_746085] deviations will be calculated for each group at each 
period (pre study, first 36 weeks, and second 36 week). Furthermore, the difference in the 
PSAV caused by [CONTACT_1996] D3 treatment will be tested using two-sample t test comparing 
the means of differences (first 36 week - second 36 week) in PSAV for the first group 
(vitamin D3 treatment then control sequence) and the second group (control then vitamin 
D3 treatment sequence).
The toxicity will be compared as difference in proportion with 95% confidence intervals.
Survival would  be evaluated on an exploratory basis but no comparison would be made 
between groups. Relationship between CYP24, 27B1, SNPs and serum 25(OH)D3

Background:  
 
Closed -loop systems are an emerging technology that automate hormone delivery .   They are 
quickly paving the way to revolutionize the treatment of type [ADDRESS_775292] emerged: dual-hormon e (insulin and glucagon) closed -loop systems and closed -loop 
systems with insulin only .  Already, the benefit of improved glycemic control compared to 
current open -loop pump therapy has been demonstrated in several trials .  Hovorka et al .  recently 
showed t hat for people with T1D, glucose control could be improved when using a single -
hormonal AP system for 12 weeks under free living conditions compared with sensor -augmented 
pump (SAP) therapy in a randomized multicenter cross -over trial  (1). Participants were in 
euglycemia for 11% more time using the AP system as compared to SAP therapy .  Kropff et al .  
also recently published results from a long -term single -hormone study showing that when 
patients with T1D used an AP dur ing evening hours and while sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007], using SAP during the 
day, the time spent in euglycemia was increased compared with participants who used SAP 24 -
hours per day  (2). HbA1c dropped more significantly when using the A P (-0·3%) compared with 
SAP ( -0·2%), though the improvement was modest .   
 
Dual -hormone APs that deliver glucagon as well as insulin have also shown promise, especially 
in helpi[INVESTIGATOR_588740] .  Glucagon works by [CONTACT_588754], 
resulting in an increase in circulating glucose.  Russell et al .  showed how use of a dual -
hormonal AP improved time spent in euglycemia and reduced time spent in hypoglycemia and 
hyperglycemia  (3). Our group has sho wn that the OHSU dual-hormon e system effectively 
manages blood glucose in a clinic setting with great progress using glucagon to reduce 
hypoglycemic epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]  (4, 5) .  
 
One of the downfalls of using  glucagon is that currently available glucagon formulations can 
only be used for a short time after reconstitution due to issue of protein aggregration and 
degradation .   For dual -hormone closed -loop systems to become fully automated in the outpatient 
IRB [ZIP_CODE] Protocol v12   Date: April 17, 2019  
   
setting, it is necessary to develop a stable glucag on solution that can remain in a pump reservoir  
for several days .  Xeris Pharmaceuticals Inc. has developed a stable, soluble liquid glucagon 
formulation (XeriSol™) that can be injected or admini stered through  an infusion pump (6).   
 
The study described within this protocol is designed to test the efficacy of a dual-hormone 
closed -loop system utilizing XeriSol™ glucagon over a 3 day period as compared to an insulin -
only closed -loop system and to a predictive low glucose suspend system.    
  
Primary Objectives:  
 To confirm superiority of the OHSU dual hormone closed -loop system as measured by 
[CONTACT_588755] -loop 
system and the predictive low glucose suspend system.    
 
Secondary Objective s: 
 To confirm superiority of the OHSU dual hormone closed -loop system as measured by 
[CONTACT_537210] 70 – 180 mg/dl as compared to the insulin 
only closed -loop system and the predictive low glucose suspend system.    
 To confirm superiority of the OHSU dual hormone closed -loop as measured by [CONTACT_588756] -loop syste m and the predictive 
low glucose suspend system.    
 
Study Hypothesis:  
We propose that the use of the OHSU dual hormone closed -loop system as compared to an 
insulin only closed -loop system and a predictive low glucose suspend system, will reduce the 
time s pent in the hypoglycemic range after exercise  as measured by [CONTACT_412593].   
 
Endpoints  
Primary Endpoint (duration: [ADDRESS_775293] exercise):   
 Percent of time with sensed glucose <70 mg/dl   
 
Secondary Endpoints  (duration: entire study) :  
 Percent of time with sensed glucose between 70 – 180 mg/dl  
 Number of carbohydrate treatments (defined as 15 or 20 grams of carbohydrate)   
 Mean sensed glucose  
 Percent of time with sensed glucose <50 mg/dl  
 Percent of time with sensed glucose >180 mg/dl  
 Mean  amount of insulin delivered in one day (in units/kg)  
 Mean  amount of glucagon delivered in one day (in mcg/kg)  
 
Study Type  
This is a single center, randomized, three treatment, crossover trial designed to compare the 
glucose control resulting from the us e of a dual and single -hormone closed -loop system as 
compared to a predictive low glucose suspend system.

Study Population  
Study population will be adults with type 1 diabetes, ages 21 – [ADDRESS_775294] in the adul t population.  Ninetee n subjects will 
be recruited to participate in studies.   
 
Power Analysis  
A Paired Means Power Analysis was used to carry out a sample size power analysis.  A total 
sample size of 19 achieves 80% power to detect a reduction in percent  time in hypoglycemia of 
62% when using the dual -hormone (DH) artificial pancreas during the 4 hours after the start of 
aerobic exercise compared to predictive low glucose suspend (PLGS). Based on prior data in our 
previous experiments, we found that subje cts spent an average of 9.8% time in hypoglycemia 
(standard deviation of 9.5%) under PLGS and 3.7% time in hypoglycemia using DH (standard 
deviation of 4.8%).  
 
Protocol Summary:  
Subjects will undergo three approximately 76 hour studies.  See Figure 1  below for a diagram of 
the study flow. During each of these intervention visits, subjects will wear an Omnipod to deliver 
insulin and a Dexcom G5 OR G6  CGM to measure glucose.  In the dual -hormone closed -loop 
study, participants will wear a second Omnipod  filled with XeriSol™ glucagon.  The first day of 
the intervention visit will be a n [ADDRESS_775295]’s basal 
profile(s) which will be transmitted to the Omnipod Personal Diabetes Manager (PDM) and 
allow for boluses to be inputted by [CONTACT_588757][INVESTIGATOR_588741].  Howe ver, this system will have a safety feature to suspend insulin 
delivery when sensor glucose is predicted to go below a threshold.  Treatment order will be 
randomized.    
 
Subjects will arrive at the clinic at approximately 7am for the inpatient visits.  Subjects will eat 
breakfast, lunch and dinner at approximately 8:30am, noon, and 6pm respectively.  Subjects will 
exercise on a treadmill for [ADDRESS_775296] will wear one subcutaneous DexcomTM 
G5 OR G6  continuo us glucose monitoring (CGM) system.  The CGM system will provide 
sensed glucose data every 5 minutes.  The accuracy of the sensed data will be obtained by 
[CONTACT_588758][INVESTIGATOR_30135].  Sensed glucose data will be wirelessly 
transmitte d via Bluetooth Low Energy (BTLE) from the Dexcom G5 OR G6  transmitter to the 
Nexus 5 master controller every five minutes.  The controller for all 3 modes is a Google Nexus 
5 phone.  The smart phone will wirelessly communicate via BTLE to an Omnipod throu gh a

PDM (Insulet Corp. ) for automated insulin delivery or in the case of dual -hormone AP, to 
another Omnipod and PDM to be used for automated glucagon delivery.    
      
A physician or nurse practitioner will be present for study start -up, will be on cam pus for 
exercise and will be immediately available on call at all other times .  The study investigators 
retain the authority to modify any aspects of the protocol at his/her discretion if he/she believes 
the subject’s safety is a concern .   During the outp atient portion of the study visits, a study 
coordinator will be able to access the cloud for monitoring purposes .  For safety purposes, all 
system alerts that are not serviced by [CONTACT_588759]/study 
investigator accord ing to Appendix D.

Visit Procedures  
Screening (Visit 1)  
Screening will take place within 12 weeks prior to the 1  week run -in period (Visit 2).  All 
screening visits will take place at OHSU’s Oregon Clinical Translational Research Institute 
(OCTRI) outpatient clinic or at the Harold Schnitzer Diabetes Health Center. The subject will be 
sent the consent form prior to the screening by [CONTACT_537214]. Upon arrival and prior to any 
procedures, study staff will explain the study, give the subject ample time to ask questions and 
consider participation, and ensure that the subject voices understanding of the informed consent 
and study requirements. To minimize the possiblity of coercion and to ensure that subject is 
signing the ap propriate version of the consent, an informed consent checklist will be used by 
[CONTACT_464]. After the subject has signed the consent,a copy of the consent/authorization form will 
be given to the subject. The original will be kept for the source document.  
 
VO 2max testing will take place at the Human Performance Lab, which is located within OHSU 
and is attached to the main hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. A code cart is on site within the Human Performance Lab 
and a code team is available by [CONTACT_412601]. Subjects will be asked to f ast before the 
screening visit for 3 hours. A capi[INVESTIGATOR_30135] (CBG) will be obtained and measured by a 
Contour Next glucose meter and recorded after consenting. Prior to measurement of any blood 
samples, the meter will undergo quality control testi ng with two different glucose levels, one 
high and one low, and both values must fall within the accepted range for a meter to be used. 
After the CBG is obtained, the study investigator may adjust the subject’s basal insulin rate as 
necessary in preparatio n for VO 2max testing to avoid hypoglycemia.  
 
Study personnel will review medical history, and medications. Height, weight, pulse, and blood 
pressure will be obtained.  A study investigator will perform a physical examination, excluding 
IRB [ZIP_CODE] Protocol v12   Date: April 17, [ADDRESS_775303] be negative to participate.  A venous blood sample will be taken for the following 
tests: hemoglobin A1C, complete blood count, complete metabolic set (including creatinin e, liver 
set, and electrolytes).   In addition, for subjects with signs and symptoms suggestive of 
pheochromocytoma, fractionated plasma metanephrines will be measured. An EKG will be 
completed. A study investigator will assess inclusion/exclusion criteria  and review the subject’s 
medical record for clarification as needed.  The subject’s insulin pump will be downloaded at 
this visit. The pump download will allow the investigator to assign an appropriate Total Daily 
Insulin Requirement (TDIR)  to the subject  during dosing visits . A three -digit subject ID number 
will be assigned to the subject.   
 
Subjects will undergo VO 2max testing at the end of the screening visit if all inclusion criteria are 
met and no exclusion criteria are met, with the exception of blo od test results which will not be 
immediately available. A study investigator will be present for the entire VO 2max testing 
procedure. Additional CBG samples will be taken immediately before and after completion of 
the VO 2max test. Subjects will be given j uice and the VO 2max test will either be delayed by 
[CONTACT_3450] 1 hour for CBG values of <80 mg/dL, or rescheduled for a different day.  Subjects 
will be given 15 -20 grams of carbohydrates for CBG values of <70 mg/dL at any point during 
the screening visi t. CBG values will be reviewed by [CONTACT_588763] a snack after VO 2max testing as needed to avoid post -testing hypoglycemia. Subjects that 
screen fail by [CONTACT_588764] 2max test will not 
complete the VO 2max test. This visit will take approximately [ADDRESS_775304] be negative 
before further participation is allowed. This visit will take approximately  1 hour.  
 
Subjects will receive training on how to use and calibrate the Dexcom G5 OR G6  CGM system 
including changing out the sensor every 7 or 10 days.  The wire glucose sensor is sterile and 
commercially available from DexcomTM and will be used for single use only as directed by [CONTACT_13989].   Subjects will be trained to insert the sensor into the subcutaneous tissue of the 
abdomen or flank after appropriate preparation of the abdominal skin as per the manufacturer’s 
directions.  Subjects will b e trained how to pair the Dexcom transmitter to the APC app on the 
Nexus 5 smart phone, start and stop a new sensor session, how to enter calibrations and how to 
begin a simulated study.  
 
The Dexcom G5 OR G6  CGM system will be calibrated at home according  to the manufacturer’s 
directions.  The CGM alerts will be set at 70 mg/dL and 300 mg/dL. Subjects will begin a run -in 
study at home after two hours when the sensor warm -up is completed. Subjects will be given a 
Dexcom a transmitter and sensor to insert th e day before each treatment visit along with a 
Contour Next meter for measuring their capi[INVESTIGATOR_588742] [ZIP_CODE] Protocol v12   Date: April 17, [ADDRESS_775305], but will be 
sufficient to help him/her become comfortable using the  Nexus smart phone  and changing out 
the infusion  pod. If the subject experiences difficulties using the Omnipod during the study 
period, study staff will be available to educate and support by [CONTACT_648].  
 
The companion accompany the subject to the start of the training visit to receive training on 
treatment in case of severe  hypoglycemia epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], including administration of rescue 
carbohydrates and use of  emergency glucagon kit.    
 
[ADDRESS_775306] will be asked to check his/her CBG before driving to the clinic and to bring a  snack 
in the car in case hypoglycemia does occur (in which case, the subject must park and treat the 
hypoglycemia).  After the first treatment visit, the washout period will be [ADDRESS_775307] be negative before further participation is allowed  
 
 
A capi[INVESTIGATOR_30135] (CBG) will be obtained and measured by [CONTACT_588765].  When they arrive, subjects will be given 15 -20 
grams of oral carbohydrate if the CBG reading is less than 70 mg/dl.  CBG values > 300 mg/dl 
will be managed at the discretion of the investigator with a correction bolus.   Serum k etones will 
also be checked.  If serum ketones are ≥ 0. 6 mM, the study will be halted and insulin therapy 
will be guided by [CONTACT_412600].   
 
During each treatment visit, glucose will be controlled using either: 1) the single hormone insulin 
only mode 2)  the dual hormone insulin and glucagon mode or 3) the insulin only mode with 
predictive low glucose suspend.  The first 11 hours of the visit will be conducted in the OCTRI 
inpatient research unit, the Harold Schnitzer Diabetes Health Center or t he Medicine Specialties 
clinic.  The subjects will then go home for the remainder of the intervention period, returning on 
Day 4 to the clinic to return all devices.  A code cart is on site at all locations and a code team is 
available by [CONTACT_412601] . 
 
Inpatient Visits ( 11 hours)  
An Omnipod will be filled with aspart insulin for all studies, but the dual hormone study will 
also have an Omnipod filled with XeriSol™ glucagon.   Each pod and corresponding PDM will 
be labeled with a sticker indicating eit her "insulin" or "glucagon" for clear identification . We will 
provide the  subjects with kits to replace the pods at  home  in case of pod  malfunction  or 
dislodgement at  home.  We will provide the  pods  with respective labels  ("insulin" or 
IRB [ZIP_CODE] Protocol v12   Date: April 17, 2019  
   
"glucagon")  attached to the outside of the sterile packaging of the pod with  instructions to 
immediately  affix  to the pod upon opening. The respective insulin or glucagon medication, pods, 
and all supplies will be  provided  separate  kits that are extensively labeled.  During the  training, 
we will instruct patients to fill one pod at a time with only the supplies from that kit out at that 
time.     
 
The pod will be primed and inserted into the skin of the subject’s abdomen or flank as directed 
by [CONTACT_3455].  The subject will  also wear a Zephyr heart rate monitor and accelerometer.  
For male subjects, two small areas may be shaved on either side of the sternum to allow proper 
placement of the Zephyr. Additionally, subjects will be asked to wear an activity watch, such as 
the A ctigraph wGT3X -BT. The activity watch will be used in addition to the Zephyr to collect 
heart rate and activity data. The activity watch will not be connected to the APC system.  See 
Figure [ADDRESS_775308] his/her own pump 
and remove his/her own insulin infusion set once insulin delivery has started via the Omnipod.

IRB [ZIP_CODE] Protocol v12   Date: April 17, [ADDRESS_775309] on using a Dexcom CGM , the 
Omnipod system, the Zephyr BioPatch heart rate and accelerometer with the APC app. Subjects 
will be shown how to use the Nexus 5 controller user interface which includes: entering basal 
profiles, insulin carb ratios and sensitivity, activating and deactivating pods, meals, carb 
treatments, blood glucose values and ketone levels, addressing alerts, troubleshooting the devices  
connection to the phone via Bluetooth, and pausing the study.   The subject will need to 
demonstrate competency in operating the system before study staff leave the room.  The subject 
will keep a journal of all occurrences and symptoms, such as hypoglycem ic spells, carbohydrate 
administrations and device problems while study staff is absent. Subjects will be given a pager 
number to call for any problems during the 76 hour visit.   
 
The algorithm will push data up to a cloud server that can be monitored rem otely every 5 
minutes. A study coordinator will be available at all times for the visits with the ability to 
monitor the APC remotely via a cloud system on the web in the event of any issues. The APC 
will generate alerts on the smartphone according to Appe ndix D. The subjects will all be trained 
as to the action required by [CONTACT_412603]. Each alert has a specific condition to be met for it to be 
considered serviced (i. e.  enter treatment with oral carbohydrates).  The refractory period is also 
specific to ea ch alert with shorter refractory periods for alerts that concern subject safety.   If the 
subject does not appropriately respond to the alert in the alotted timeframe, the alert will push to 
the study coordinator and the on -call investigator according to A ppendix D. At that time, the 
coordinator will pull up the web -based monitoring system. The study investigator and technician 
may intervene with a telephone call or a personal visit at any time. For example, staff will call to 
remind the subject to calibrat e the sensor. If the subject cannot be reached and sensor glucose is 
below 50 mg/dl, the emergency contacts provided by [CONTACT_588766]. If the alert is 
still unserviced and study staff are unable to reach the subject or either of the emergen cy 
contacts, emergency medical services will be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530]. To facilitate this, the Nexus [ADDRESS_775310]’s location and push GPS coordinates to the cloud server approximately every [ADDRESS_775311] a 
cell phone number on file that can receive texts with pushed alerts.  
 
During all studies, sensed glucose data will be wirelessly transmitted via BTLE from the 
Dexcom transmitter  to the FMPD algorithm every five minutes.  The single and dual hormone 
modes of the algorithm will calculate insulin only or insulin and glucagon doses and will run on 
a Google Nexus 5 phone.  The predictive low glucose suspend mode of the algorithm will deliver 
insulin according to a pre -set basal profile(s) for the subject, which the subject may change if 
needed for safety as he or she would normally do.  The smart phone will wirelessly communicate 
IRB [ZIP_CODE] Protocol v12   Date: April 17, 2019  
   
via BTLE to a PDM communicating to an Omnipod for automa ted insulin delivery, and for the 
dual hormone closed -loop system, to a second PDM and Omnipod for automated glucagon 
delivery.    
 
During normal operation, the sensor will be calibrated approximately every 12 or 24 hours.   If at 
any time the study staff determines that a sensor can no longer be used, a new sensor will be 
inserted, which will be calibrated after two hours and then used to run the closed -loop system. 
The sensor will also be recalibrated per the manufacturer’s directions if the sensor become s 
inaccurate. An inaccurate sensor is defined as either (1) a sensor whose value is 35% or more 
different than a CBG when the CBG ≥ 75 mg/dl or (2) when a sensor is more than 30 mg/dl 
different than a CBG when the CBG < 75 mg/dl. . Additional calibrations m ay be ordered at the 
discretion of the  investigator on call.  
  
In order to ensure safety and to assess sensor accuracy, the subject will be asked to check their 
blood glucose two times during the day (typi[INVESTIGATOR_412567]), for 
sympt oms of hypoglycemia, and in response to system alert (such as for low or high sensor 
alerts ).  We will also instruct patients to perform  capi[INVESTIGATOR_588743] [ADDRESS_775312] will be able to check his/her capi[INVESTIGATOR_588744] [ADDRESS_775313]’s blood glucose is < 70 mg/dl or 
is experiencing symptoms of hypoglycemia, he/s he will be instructed to treat with 15 grams of 
carbohydrates and glucose tablets will be available for rescue treatment.   The study investigator 
retains the authority to check blood glucose at more frequent time points at his/her discretion.   
 
For subject safety, if a sensor value is not available for [ADDRESS_775314] for more than 30 minutes, the insulin Omnipod will begin insulin delivery 
according to a pre -set basal profile(s) inputted for the subject a t study start . When communication 
with the sensor or pod is restored, the system will automatically resume, updating the IOB 
accordingly. If sensor glucose values are not being acquired, glucagon delivery will be suspended. 
When this occurs for a lost sens or, the APC system will also activate the predictive low glucose 
suspend feature if the last known sensor value was within the range of 70 -140 mg/dl and predicted 
to fall below 90 mg/dl within thirty minutes or if the sensor glucose is less than 70 mg/dl. 
Maximum insulin suspension time is [ADDRESS_775315], lunch and dinner at approximately 8:30am, noon and 6pm 
respectively. Meal s will be announced to the controller. For each meal, food items will be self -
selected from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_588745]. The number of grams of carbohydrates will be counted by [CONTACT_588767]. Immediately before eating, each subject will r eceive 80% 
(nominal) of his/her typi[INVESTIGATOR_199252] -meal insulin dose based on their insulin to carbohydrate ratio. 
The same self -selected meal will be offered on subsequent inpatient visits, and in the event a 
particular food item is not available, a different it em with a similar amount of carbohydrate will 
be provided.  
 
Subjects will exercise at approximately 2pm. Subjects will warm -up for 5 minutes then exercise 
for approximately 45 minutes on a treadmill. Subjects will exercise at the CTRC. A code cart is 
IRB [ZIP_CODE] Protocol v12   Date: April 17, [ADDRESS_775316] be 80 mg/dl or higher to begin exercise. Subjects will 
exercise at a fixed intensity level to a target heart rate (±10%) bas ed on the heart rate achieved at 
60% of their VO 2max determined at screening.  This protocol will allow the exercise to be graded 
according to each participant’s relative capacity. The speed and grade of the treadmill will be 
adjusted by [CONTACT_411086] p ersonnel with a goal of keepi[INVESTIGATOR_588746] 45 minutes.  
During the exercise period, there will be defined rules for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_99492], including:  
1) If the subject feels unwell,  
2) If the subject develops hyp oglycemic symptoms, such as excessive sweating, 
shaking/tremors, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], feelings of dread or panic, light -headedness, nausea, 
difficulty concentrating or the like,  
3) If the subject develops chest pain/pressure,  
4) If the subject develops undue shortness of breath (SOB),  
5) Signs of poor perfusion: light -headedness, confusion, ataxia, pallor, cyanosis, nausea, or 
cold and clammy skin  
6) If the maximum heart rate of the subject (MHR) is exceeded,  
7) For patient preference.  
 
If the exercise is stopped prematurely, the duration of exercise will be noted by [CONTACT_588768], the exercise will be stopped after 
that same time duration for subsequent studies. For subject safety, if capi[INVESTIGATOR_412572] < 
70 mg/dl at any point during the exercise period, the subject will consume 15 g of carbohydrates 
and delay completion of exercise until blood glucose raises above 80 mg/dl. If glucose fails to 
rise above 80 mg/dl after a carbohydrate treatment during exercise, a second treatment of 15 
grams will be given. Since insulin will be turned off briefly, exercise will be delayed for subjects 
with ketones above 0.6 mM to minimize hyperglycemia until levels drop below this threshold.  
 
The Fading Memory Proportio nal Derivative (FMPD) algorithm will determine the insulin and 
(when applicable) glucagon delivery rates for the closed -loop studies. The FMPD algorithm 
determines insulin and glucagon delivery rates based on proportional error, defined as the 
difference b etween the current glucose level and the target level, and the derivative error, defined 
as the rate of change of the glucose. Each of these errors is calculated over a time interval. The 
“fading memory” designation refers to weighting recent errors more h eavily than remote errors. 
This weighting provides an adaptive component to the algorithm. In simple terms, the insulin 
rate is increased for high or rising glucose levels and glucagon is given for low or falling glucose 
levels (at times of impending hypog lycemia). Gain factors determine the degree to which 
proportional or derivative errors lead to changes in hormone delivery rates. There are separate 
gain factors for proportional and derivative error for both insulin and glucagon. Positive 
proportional err ors (glucose level above target) and positive derivative errors (rising glucose 
level) call for an increase in the insulin delivery rate.  
 
When in predictive low glucose suspend mode, the system will deliver insulin based on the basal 
profile(s) entered f or each subject. The subjects will manually enter in boluses for meals and 
corrections into the APC user interface. Using this system, the subjects will manage their blood 
IRB [ZIP_CODE] Protocol v12   Date: April 17, 2019  
   
glucose as they  normally would. The advantage is that the system is integrated with  a glucose 
sensor to give advanced diabetes control.  
 
The predictive suspend feature will activate within the range of 70 -140 mg/dl if sensor glucose is 
predicted to fall below 90 mg/dl within thirty minutes. If this occurs on a consecutive turn, the 
APC system will activate a minimum 30 minute suspension and a maximum of 120 minutes 
within any 150 minute window.  Suspension will be limited to 180 minutes during the nighttime 
(11pm -7am).  After this minimum 30 minutes has lapsed, insulin delivery will resu me if sensor 
glucose is above 70 mg/dl and predicted to rise above 120 mg/dl within the next 30 minutes. As 
long as sensor glucose is above 140 mg/dl, the predictive suspend feature will not activate. 
Prediction of sensor glucose is based on linear regress ion of the prior ten minutes of sensor 
glucose data. During the predictive low glucose suspend mode arm of the study, subjects will not 
be allowed to change their insulin dosing prior to the start of the exercise. This is being done to 
allow for equal comp arison of dosing and subsequent glucose control across arms.  
 
Subjects will wear a Zephyrlife BioPatch monitoring device for collecting heart rate and 
accelerometry data. The Zephyr transmits this data to the Nexus [ADDRESS_775317] is exercising. If the communication is not working 
between the Zephyr and the Nexus 5 at the time of exercise during the inpatien t visit, exercise 
may be delayed until communication is restored.  Energy expenditure (EE) is estimated every 
minute using a time series approach.   This time series model uses the inputs of heart rate (HR) 
and physical activity (PA). The EE estimation is f urther personalized by [CONTACT_588769].  If the communication is not working between 
the Zephyr and the Nexus 5 at the time of exercise during a visit, exercise may be delayed until 
communication is restored.  
 
The exercise threshold will be set to 4 METs/min for every subject at the start of the study. If the 
corrected MET value is greater than [ADDRESS_775318] exercise period, exercise is considered to be ongoing.  An exercise dosing adjustment 
algorithm will be used when exercise is detected that has been prev iously tested and published 
(7).   When exercise is detected while in single or dual -hormone mode, and the subject confirms 
he/she is exercising, insulin will be turned off for 30 minutes (nominal) immediately after 
detection of exercise. Subsequently, the insulin infusion rate will be reduced to 50% (nominal) 
for a period of 1 hour (nominal). During use of the dual -hormone closed -loop system, the 
glucagon set p oint during exercise will also be set higher to 110 mg/dl (nominal). This will result 
in glucagon being called for at an earlier point with an increase in the amount of glucagon 
delivered. Also, the maximum amount of glucagon allowed to be delivered in a 5 0 minute time 
period will be increased by [CONTACT_65752], which will allow for more glucagon to be delivered during 
and immediately after exercise if glucose levels are droppi[INVESTIGATOR_588747].  The maximal amount of 
glucagon that can be delivered in a 24 hour period wil l remain unchanged. These adjustments 
will continue during the same period of time that insulin adjustments are being made (nominal 
1.5 hours) after exercise. After the initial adjustment in glucagon target, the investigator will 
evaluate the subject’s res ponse to glucagon during exercise and may change the target further, 
within the range of nominal values, based on whether the subject still went hypoglycemic (< 70 
mg/dl) or hyperglycemic (>180 mg/dl) within 3 hours from the start of exercise.  
IRB [ZIP_CODE] Protocol v12   Date: April 17, 2019  
   
With regards  to the daytime and nightime glucose target, % of premeal insulin bolus and exercise 
insulin and glucagon adjustment parameters: these are current nominal values that may be 
adjusted within the FDA approved minimum and maximum range for each adjustable par ameter.   
 
During predictive low glucose suspend mode, a Zephyr BioPatch will transmit heart rate and 
accelerometry values to the APC for the purposes of exercise detection, but exercise detection 
will not trigger any changes in insulin delivery while in t his mode.  
 
The exercise detection algorithm will prompt the participant if exercise is occurring prior to 
adjusting dosing.  For example, if the participant’s METs exceed a threshold of [ADDRESS_775319] this and ask the participant if they are ex ercising.  If the participant acknowledges this 
and says “Yes”, the AP will adjust the dosing.  If the subject selects that they are not exercising, 
the APC will present a dropdown menu from which the subject can select their current activity 
for logging p urposes (e. g.  housework).  It will also present several choices for the amount of 
time that exercise detection will be suspended so that the subject will not continuously receive 
detection alerts during that activity (15, 30 or 60 minute suspension).  If  the participant says 
“No”, this is considered a false alert because the algorithm has detected exercise, but the 
participant was not actually exercising.  Because these false alerts can be annoying to the 
participants, the AP includes an adjustable exerci se detection threshold.  The adjustable exercise 
detection threshold works as follows:  
 At the start of the study, the participants’ exercise detection threshold will be set to 4 
METs.  
 On the first day of the study, when the participant exercises at the ho spi[INVESTIGATOR_307], the AP 
records the participants’ METs during exercise and also records the participants’ METs 
during activities of daily living and other non -exercise events.   
 Based on data from this controlled setting, a “lower bound MET” for that subject will b e 
calculated based on a lower -bound confidence interval set around their METs recorded 
during exercise.  
 If that participants’ lower bound MET during exercise is greater than 4, their maximum 
allowable exercise threshold value (MAETV) will be set to the lower bound MET.  
Otherwise, the MAETV will remain at 4.  
 Every time a false alert occurs for detecting exercise, the participants’ exercise detection 
threshold will increase by 0.[ADDRESS_775320] stops exercising after a short 
time with continued adjustments to insulin or insulin/glucagon.  Therefore, an exercise 
cancellation option is available on the user inter face for up to [ADDRESS_775321] is actually exercising, an exercise announcement 
button on the APC  user interface will be used.  
 
 
IRB [ZIP_CODE] Protocol v12   Date: April 17, [ADDRESS_775322]’s schedule does not allow them to return to the clinic before the [ADDRESS_775323] pod was activated, then a new insulin pod (and new glucagon pod  if applic able)  
will be placed as described above approximately 1 -2 hours prior to discharge to avoid use of any 
single pod beyond 72 hours. At the completion of the 11  hour inpatient visit, subjects will be 
discharged from the clinic.  Subjects will complete a VAS injection site discomfort assessment 
for the glucagon infusion site , if applicable  (see Appendix E). Capi[INVESTIGATOR_588748] 15 minutes apart prior to 
discharge. Subjects will wait t o discharge home if capi[INVESTIGATOR_412572] <85 and or >300 
mg/dl or at the discretion of the study investigator, treatment will be at the  discretion  of the study 
investigator. Once subject’s capi[INVESTIGATOR_412575] 85 -300 mg/dl , they can be 
discharged home.  Subjects will be given enough supplies to continue running the study while at 
home for [ADDRESS_775324] the specifics of 
his/her activities at home. After the subject is di scharged on Day 1, he/she will return home for 
Day 2 and Day 3 and return to OHSU on the morning of Day 4 to return all devices and end the 
study.  
 
We are aware that there is a risk of severe hypoglycemia while the subjects are at home. The 
system will al ert if the sensed glucose values fall below 70 mg/dl without exercise detection and 
below 85 mg/dl with exercise detection, prompting the subject to obtain a capi[INVESTIGATOR_588749]. Subjects will be required to live with at least one other person a ge 18 or older 
and live within 40 miles of OHSU. All subjects will provide two emergency contacts to study 
staff and will be given an emergency glucagon hypokit if they don’t already have one.  
In case of a system error that cannot be corrected immediately  with the subject off campus, the 
subject will be able to to pause the APC system. Pausing will allow the Omnipod filled with 
insulin to begin basal insulin delivery for a pre -set basal profile(s) inputted for the subject at the 
study start. If there is a pending meal bolus in the insulin back log, the pause mode will be 
delayed to allow the bolus to finish delivering. Subjects will be able to give meal boluses and 
corrections through the Omnipod while in pause mode. When the error is resolved, the 
particip ant can exit pause mode and the closed loop system can be resumed.  If the subject 
pauses the system, this will be visible on the cloud server and may prompt a telephone call from 
study staff to determine the issue and the best way to resolve it.  
 
Subject s will be given sufficient blood glucose testing supplies, ketone testing supplies and 
Omnipods for [ADDRESS_775325] study staff at any time during the  outpatient portion of 
the visit. Subjects will be asked to perform 45 minutes of an aerobic exercise of his/her choice 
(excluding swimming) on Day [ADDRESS_775326] be 100 mg/dl 
or higher to begin exercise while subject is at home. Subjects will be required to have a person 
age [ADDRESS_775327]’s CBG is > 100 mg/dl or for 
60 minutes after exercise is completed -whichever is longer.  
 
 
 
IRB [ZIP_CODE] Protocol v12   Date: April 17, [ADDRESS_775328]’s own insu lin pump will be restarted. The study investigator will 
consult with the subject regarding appropriate insulin dosing for the remainder of the day. The 
HR monitors, Omnipods and Dexcom sensor will be removed from the subject. All infus ion sites 
and the sensor site will be inspected for signs of irritation or infection.  The study investigator 
will complete the Draize scale assessment for the glucagon infusion site , if applicable  (see 
Appendix F). In addition, the sensor will be inspected for the possibili ty of breakage or  fracture. 
If there is any evidence of sensor breakage, it will be recorded. If an area of inflammation of [ADDRESS_775329]. Subjects will be given oral 
carbohydrate for values below 85 mg/dl, and will be given an insulin bolus if deemed appropriat e 
by [CONTACT_54851] 150 mg/dl.  
 
If a study visit is stopped prematurely, such as due to technical problems, the subject will be 
asked if they can repeat the study visit that was terminated early with additional compensation 
provid ed. Repeating the study visit will be optional.  
 
Hypoglycemia Treatment Guidelines  
  CBG < 70 mg/dl  
o Give 15 grams of oral carbohydrate.  
o Repeat treatment every 15 minutes as needed to raise blood glucose ≥70 mg/dl.   
 Presence of STUPOR, LOSS OF CONSCIOUSNES S, or SEIZURE  
o Give 1 mg glucagon SC.  
o Verify that insulin is turned off.  
o Further management per study investigator.  
 
Hyperglycemia Treatment Guidelines  
If the sensed glucose is ≥ 300 mg/dl, the subject will be instructed to check their blood glucose 
and to check the Omnipod for malfunction. This would include checking for insulin leaks, 
making sure Omnipod is securely adhered to skin, and for closed -loop studies, making sure there 
are no error messages on the phone running the algorithm.  
 
If capi[INVESTIGATOR_588750] 300 mg/dl for more than 2 hours or is ≥ 400 mg/dl at any 
time, the subject will be instructed to check serum ketones using the Abbott Precision Xtra meter 
and to change out the infusion set. If serum ketones are over 0.[ADDRESS_775330] will be encouraged to drink sugar -free 
liquids. If serum ketones are above 1.5 mM at any time, th e study will be stopped and insulin 
will be administered as directed by [CONTACT_412612].  
IRB [ZIP_CODE] Protocol v12   Date: April 17, [ADDRESS_775331] 4 hours of the study: 
1) capi[INVESTIGATOR_412581] < 40 mg/dl at any time point, 2) capi[INVESTIGATOR_588751] 400 mg/dl on two occasions (120 min or more apart within a 4 hour window), 3) 
capi[INVESTIGATOR_412582] 400 mg/dl on two occasions more than 120 minutes apart but 
outside of the 4 hour window and during that time, the capi[INVESTIGATOR_588752] 250 mg/dl, 4) serum ketones are above 1.5 mM at any time , 5) seizure or unconsciousness 
associated with hypoglycemia, or 6) persistent nausea and vomiting thought to be related to 
glucagon .  
 
Statistical methods  
 
Primary endpoint  
The primary study endpoint is  percent of time with glucose sensor < 70 mg/dl for the four hours 
after exercise. The hypothesis to be tested is the dual hormone closed -loop system with exercise 
detection is superior in reducing hypoglycemia as compared to the insulin only closed -loop 
system and as compared to the predictive low glucose suspend system.  Data will be analyzed 
using generalized estimating equations, which takes into account correlated data and repeated 
meas ures.  Data will be analyzed using an intention -to-treat analysis and missing sensed glucose 
values will be interpolated.   
    
Secondary endpoints  
Secondary endpoints will be analyzed using generalized estimating equations and using an 
intention -to-treat analysis.  Missing sensed glucose and missing CBG values will be interpolated.  
A Bonferroni -Holmes correction for multiple comparisons will be applied only to the secondary 
endpoint analyses.    
 
 
Confidentiality and Protection of Human Subjects  
RISKS and  BENEFITS  
Risks:  The risks of the protocol procedures are considered minor. Nonetheless, since pumps and 
sensors used within automated glucose control systems are imperfect, there is a risk for 
hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia  All studies will issue alerts and will be remote monitored 
during each visit with unserviced alerts being pushed to the study coordinator and investigator. If 
sensed glucose goes below 70 mg/dl or above 300 mg/dl, a capi[INVESTIGATOR_588753] . A study investigator w ill be on call at all times.  
IRB [ZIP_CODE] Protocol v12   Date: April 17, [ADDRESS_775332] each removed 
sensor for the possibility of breakage or fracture. Any evidence of sensor breakage will be 
recorded and reported to FDA and the sensor company . 
 
XeriSol™ glucagon may cause blood sugars to go too high, which is also unlikely in the low 
doses that will be given. Rarely, there can be allergic responses to glucagon, such as skin 
redness, hives, itching of the skin, swelling of the mouth, or breathing difficulties.  A few people 
may experience rapid heartbeat for a short while. There is a potential risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_84065] -
glucagon antibodies from exposure to glucagon. The se reactions are considered very unlikely. 
After glucagon injection, nausea, headac he, dizziness and vomiting may occur occasionally. 
Users may feel a stinging sensation or moderate pain when the medication is injected and 
redness at the infusion site. Risks and side effects related to the injection of glucagon medicine 
include:  
 
Likely

Monitoring Procedures:  
This protocol is written in accordance with the principles established by [CONTACT_941] 18th World Medical 
Assembl y General Assembly (Helsinki, 1964) and amendments and clarifications adopted by [CONTACT_941] 
29th (Tokyo, 1975), 35th (Venice, 1983), 41st (Hong Kong, 1989), 48th (Somerset West, South 
Africa, 1996), 52nd (Edinburgh, 2000), 53rd (Washington, 2002), 55th (Tokyo, 20 04), 59th 
(Seoul, 2008), and 64th (Brazil, 2013) General Assemblies. The investigator will ensure that the 
study described in this protocol is conducted in full conformance with those principles, the 
protocol, current FDA regulations, ICH Good Clinical Pra ctices (GCP) guidelines, Good 
Laboratory Practices (GLP) guidelines, local ethical and regulatory requirements, including the 
IRB [ZIP_CODE] Protocol v12   Date: April 17, [ADDRESS_775335], U.S. applicable Code of Federal Regulations (title 21), 
any IEC requirements relative to clin ical studies.  
Should a conflict arise, the investigator will follow whichever law or guideline affords the 
greater protection to the individual subject. The investigator will also ensure thorough familiarity 
with the appropriate use and potential risks of  use of the study device, as described in this 
protocol, prior to the initiation of the study.  
Unanticipated problems will be detected by [CONTACT_54857] -approved research protocol and the current IRB approved 
consent form, any underlying disease or conditions of the subject experiencing the adverse event, 
a careful assessment of whether the adverse event is related or possibly related to the subject’s 
participation in the study.  
 
Triggers for reporting unanticipated problems are seizure, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], death or any other 
occurrence considered serious by [CONTACT_978]. If ongoing monitoring of the closed -loop studies reveals 
studies repeatedly being terminated because of unresponsive hyperglycemi a or repeated serious 
hypoglycemia (resulting in altered mental status, loss of consciousness, or seizure) believed not 
amenable to revisions in control system parameter tuning, then the study will be discontinued 
immediately. If studies in two subjects ar e stopped for severe hypoglycemia or severe 
hyperglycemia, then the entire study will be halted . Severe hypoglycemia is defined as an event 
requiring the assistance of another person to administer carbohydrate, glucagon or resuscitative 
actions. Severe hyp erglycemia is defined as  1) capi[INVESTIGATOR_412582] 400 mg/dl on two 
occasions (120 min or more apart within a  4 hour  window), 2) capi[INVESTIGATOR_412582] 
400 mg/dl on two occasions more than 120 minutes apart but outside of the 4 hour windo w and 
during that time, the capi[INVESTIGATOR_412584] 250 mg/dl, or 3) serum ketones 
are above 1.5  mM at any time.  In addition , if there is any unexpected event such as death or 
patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], the studies will be stopped until the root cause is evaluated.  
 
Any adverse event (AE) and/or unanticipated problem (UP) will be reported to the investigator 
monitor immediately by [CONTACT_54858]. Hypo - and hyperglycemia will not be 
considered AEs unless subject has positive keto nes or displays symptoms of hypoglycemia such 
as: loss of consciousness, slurred speech, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_54812].  One of the 
investigators will always be on -call during the closed -loop studies and will write up a description 
of the adverse event/unanticipated problem. All reportable new information (RNI) will be 
reported to the IRB within five calendar days after the PI [INVESTIGATOR_54813]. RNI is any 
information that might meet the regulatory definition of an unanticipated problem involving  risks 
to subjects or others or serious or continuing noncompliance that might impact the criteria for 
IRB approval. The report will be submitted to the IRB by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_54814]. A summary of all UP's and adverse events, inclu ding those that do not meet the 
requirement for RNI, will be submitted with the continuing review. The FDA will be notified of 
any unanticipated adverse event related to the use of the study device. Notification will be made 
within 10 days after the Princi pal Investigator becomes aware of the event.

Appendix E: Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for Injection Site Discomfort  
 
Investigative Site Instructions:  The subject should complete the VAS for Injection Site 
Discomfort at discharge on Day [ADDRESS_775353] completes the VAS by [CONTACT_740] a single vertical line through the scale 
corresponding to the perceived intensity (severity) of discomfort according to the instructions 
below. The goal is for the subject to report the amount of discomfort, if any, remaining at each 
time point, as opposed to reporting the transient pain associated with needle insertion.  
Note: If a subject is unable to physically complete t he questionnaire, the subject will indicate the 
point on the VAS corresponding to their level of discomfort, and study staff will enter a vertical 
line at that point. Documentation will be provided on each completed questionnaire as to who 
completed the fo rm. 
Please verify the length of the VAS line to be [ADDRESS_775354] Instructions:  Ignoring any pain from insertion of the Omnipod, please draw a single 
vertical line through the scale below that corresponds to the intensit y (severity) of any discomfort 
you have felt at the glucagon Omnipod insertion site.  
Discomfort could include stinging, burning, tingling, throbbing or pain. The further to the right 
you make your vertical mark, indicates the more intense discomfort you ar e feeling.  
You should normally draw a straight line across the scale to indicate your current level of 
discomfort. However, if you are currently feeling no discomfort, you should circle the vertical 
line on the left end of scale (above the word “no”). If y ou are currently feeling the worst 
discomfort possible, you should circle the vertical line on the right end of the scale.

Study  Personnel Instructions:   Question 1a should be should be completed by [CONTACT_588774] [ADDRESS_775355] reporting 
discomfort other than “none,” should complete question 1b. Any subject reporting duration of 
discomfo rt of “at least 10 minutes” should complete follow -up question 1c at the end of the study 
visit (i.e., at 180±[ADDRESS_775356] -injection). The goal is for th e subject to report the qualitative 
nature and duration of discomfort, if any, associated with inject ion of study drug, ignoring any 
transient pain associated with needle insertion.  
Note: If a subject is unable to physically complete the questionnaire, the  subject will provide 
verbal responses, which will be recorded on the questionnaire by [CONTACT_464]. Documentation will 
be provided on each completed questionnaire as to who completed the form.  
Subject Instructions:  Please answer question 1a and, if applica ble to you, questions 1b and 1c. In 
answering these questions, you should ignore any pain from insertion of the needle.

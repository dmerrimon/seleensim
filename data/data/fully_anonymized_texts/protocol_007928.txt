 Methodology:  
This is a  multicenter, open  label study of the long -term safety of IDP -[ADDRESS_1032452] a clinical 
diagnosis of moderat e to severe plaque psoriasis ( defined as IGA score of 3 or 4).  
Approximately [ADDRESS_1032453] at b aseline. The study drug will 
be applied topi[INVESTIGATOR_516858] (as determined by [CONTACT_63376] b aseline)  with the  initial 
application being made by [CONTACT_754372]. Subjects will apply their  
treatments at home once daily as explained by [CONTACT_500821]. All subjects will be instructed to avoid exposure to direct sunlight, artificial ultraviolet light 
sources  and to use protective clothing to pr event sunburn.  
Following the initial [ADDRESS_1032454] a 1 grade improvement from 
baseline to continue in the study. This 4 -week evaluation/treatment cycle may continue for up to 1 year 
(ie, subjects will be evaluated every 4 weeks and subjects who achieve treatment success will receive no 
treatment until the next 4- week evaluation visit and subjects who do not achieve treatment success will 
receive once daily treatment until the next 4- week evaluation visit). If a su bject remains on treatment 
after Week [ADDRESS_1032455] an IGA score equat ing to “Clear” or Almost Clear”  to continue 
on study or they will be  considered a failed treatment . Subjects who achieve a treatment success at any 
visit may not achieve a treatment success at a subsequent visit, and may therefore undergo periods of treatment and periods of nontreatment. The minimum continuous  treatment ex posure will be (the first) 8 
weeks and the maximum  continuous  treatment exposure may be up to but no more than 24 weeks.   
Subjects who continue after Week 24 will be monitored to ensure treatment exposure does not exceed 24 consecutive weeks .

 The subjects  will be  evaluated at Screening (Day -35 to Day -1), Baseline (Day 0), and Weeks 2, 4, 8, 
12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48, and 52. The IGA will be performed at every study visit.  
The study coordinator  or designee will dispense new containers of study drug to the  subject at 
appropriate (requiring treatment)  study visit (ie, at Week 2, Week 4, and any subsequent study visit at 
which the subject did not achieve treatment success). At all postbaseline study visits (Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 
16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48, and 52)  the subjects will be asked to return their containers of study 
drug and have their treatment compliance evaluated  if applicable. During the study, subjects  will be 
allowed to use inve stigator approved non -medicated cleansers ,  moisturizers  and suncreens; no other 
skin care products will be permitted on the treatment areas.  
The investigator will assess the BSA  affected by [CONTACT_754373].  
Local skin reactions will be evaluated and potential AEs will be assessed  at every study visit. An 
abbreviated physical examination will be performed every 8 weeks during the study (ie, at Baseline and 
Weeks 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, and 52). Blood samples will be collected  for complete blood count with 
differential (CBC/Diff) and serum chemistry  at Screening and Weeks 4, 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, and 52. 
Female subjects of childbearing potential, will undergo  urine and serum pregnanc y testing at s creening , 
and urine pregnancy testing will be performed at b aseline prior to randomization and at all study visits 
other than Week 2 . 
Subjects who discontinue study participation early will be asked to complete all Week 52 assessments, 
as appropriate, prior to commencem ent of any alternative therapy for psoriasis (if possible). Subjects 
who discontinue from the study during the treatment period will not be replaced.  
Subjects who discontinue from the study due to clinically significant laboratory abnormalities or other AEs will be instructed to follow  up with their primary care physician, if indicate d. If any subject has an 
AE during the study , the subject will be follow  by [CONTACT_117186] (return to normal or to 
the baseline state) or stabilization, as d etermined by [CONTACT_093].  
In addition  to the above, application of study drug may be delayed or halted at any time if ongoing safety 
data evaluations (including reports of local skin reactions, such as skin atrophy, or severe AE s) raise 
concern for subject safety. If subject participation is suspended, all of the subject’s safety data will be reviewed by [CONTACT_754374] a course of action.  
Number of subjects  planned:  
Approxi mately [ADDRESS_1032456] 300 subjects for 6 months and 100 subjects for 
1 year.  
Inclusion  criteria :  
1. Male or female, of any race, at least [ADDRESS_1032457] 3%, but no more than 12%. The face, scalp, palms, soles, axillae, and intertriginous areas are to be excluded from  this calculation.

 5 Introduction  
Psoriasis is a chronic, immune mediated disease, and varies widely in its clinical expression. 
Disease severity ranges from mild (limited number of plaques) to very severe. Characteristic features of psoriasis include hyperproliferation of epi[INVESTIGATOR_516862]/epi[INVESTIGATOR_249245], resulting in sharply demarcated red plaques, which may be covered by [CONTACT_516878].  
There are presently no curative treatments for psoriasis. Treatment options focus on relieving 
symptoms, reducing inflammation, induration, and scaling, and controlling the extent of the disease. Patient age, severity of disease, and the type and extent of body surface area (BSA) involvement are considerations in selecting therapy. 
Topi[INVESTIGATOR_516863], but may be impractical when psoriasis 
involves a large BSA. The mainstay of psoriasis treatment is topi[INVESTIGATOR_11930], which range in potency from superpotent to low potency (Class I to VII, respectively). Generally, the more potent corticosteroids are required for effective management of psoriasis.  
IDP-118 (tazarotene 0.045% and halobetasol propi[INVESTIGATOR_16847] 0.01%) Lotion is being developed 
for once daily treatment of plaque psoriasis. The current study is designed to obtain long-term safety data for IDP -118 Lotion when used over the course of a 1- year period  
6 Study Objectives and Purpose  
The objective of this study is to evaluate the long- term safety of IDP -118 Lotion following 
once daily, 8-week treatment courses in subjects with plaque psoriasis followed for up to 1 year. Subjects will receive treatment courses as needed during the year to manage their 
plaque psoriasis with the following safety endpoint evaluations being conducted: 
• The percentage of subjects who experience a local skin reaction (itching, dryness, and 
burning/stinging) graded at a level of [ADDRESS_1032472] 
application of study drug 
• Changes from baseline in all safety laboratory values and vital sign measurements as 
summarized using descriptive statistics by [CONTACT_67486]  
• Occurrences of new and ongoing adverse events (AE s). Descriptions of AEs will 
include the dates of onset and resolution (if resolved), maximum severity, 
seriousness, action taken regarding the study drug, corrective treatment, outcome, and investigator’s assessment of causality  
• The number of treatment co urses administered over the year of observation

 7 Investigational Plan 
7.1 Overall Study Design and Plan: Description 
This is a multicenter, open label study of the long- term safety of IDP -[ADDRESS_1032473] a clinical diagnosis of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis ( defined as an 
Investigator’s Global Assessment [IGA] score of 3 or 4).  
Approximately [ADDRESS_1032474] at b aseline. The 
study drug will be applied topi[INVESTIGATOR_516858] (as determined by [CONTACT_373176]) with the initial application being made by [CONTACT_754378]. Subjects will apply their treatments at home once daily as explained by [CONTACT_500821]. All subjects will b e instructed to avoid 
exposure to direct sunlight, artificial ultraviolet light sources, and to wear protective clothing to prevent sunburn. 
Following the initial [ADDRESS_1032475] a 1 grade improvement from baseline to continue in the study. This 4 -week evaluation/treatment cycle may continue for up to 1 year (ie, subjects will be 
evaluated every 4 weeks and subjects who achieve treatment success will receive no treatment until the next 4- week evaluation visit and subjects who do not achieve treatment 
success will receive once daily tr eatment until the next evaluation visit). If a subject remains 
on treatment after Week [ADDRESS_1032476] an IGA score equating to “Clear” or 
Almost Clea r” to continue on study or they will be considered a failed treatment . Subjects 
who achieve a treatment success at any visit may undergo periods of non- treatment. The 
minimum continuous treatment exposure will be (the first) [ADDRESS_1032477] the Week 24 visit will be monitored to ensure treatment exposure does not exceed 24 consecutive weeks .

At all post-baseline study visits (Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48, and 52) the subjects will be asked to return their containers of study drug and will have their treatment compliance evaluated as  applicable.  The study coordinator or designee at each 
investigational center will dispense new containers  of study drug to the subject at each post-
baseline study visit (ie, at Week 2, Week 4, and any subsequent study visit at which the subject did not achieve treatment success). During the study, subjects will be allowed to use investigator  approved non- medi cated cleansers , moisturizers  and sunscreens ; no other skin 
care products will be permitted on the treatment areas.  
Local skin reactions will be evaluated and potential AEs will be assessed  at every study visit. 
An abbreviated physical examination will be performed every 8 weeks during the study (ie, at Baseline and Weeks 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, and 52). Blood samples will be collected for complete blood count with differential (CB C/Diff) and  serum chemistry at S creening and 
Weeks 4, 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, and 52. All female sub jects of childbearing potential will 
undergo both urine and serum pregnancy testing at screening , and urine pregnancy testing 
will be performed at baseline and at all s tudy visits other than Week 2. 
Subjects who discontinue study participation early will be asked to complete all Week 52 assessments, as appropriate, prior to commencement of any alternative therapy for psoriasis (if possible). Subjects who discontinue from the study during the treatment period will not be replaced.  
Subjects who discontinue from the study due to clinically significant laboratory abnormalities or AEs will be instructed to follow  up with the investigator and/or their 
primary care physician, if  indicated. If any subject has an AE during the treatment period, the 
subject will be followed -up by [CONTACT_117186] (return to normal or to the 
baseline state) or stabilization, as determined by [CONTACT_093].  
In addition to the above , application of study drug may be delayed or halted at any time if 
ongoing safety data evaluations (including reports of local skin reactions, such as skin atrophy, or severe AEs) raise concern for subject safety. If subject participation is suspended, all of the subject’s safety data will be reviewed by [CONTACT_754379] a course of action.

Amendment 1, Clinical Study Protocol, [ADDRESS_1032489] follow the instructions exactly. 
A deviation from the protocol is an unintended and/or unanticipated departure from the 
procedures and/or processes approved by [CONTACT_754383] 
(IRB) or Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) and agreed to by [CONTACT_093]. Deviations usually have an impact on individual patients or a small group of patients and do not involve inclusion/exclusion or primary endpoint criteria.  
A protocol violation occurs when there is non- adherence to the protocol that results in a 
significant, additional risk to the patient,  when the patient or investigator has failed to adhere 
to significant protocol requirements (inclusion/exclusion criteria) and the patient was 
enrolled without prior sponsor approval, or when there is non- adherence to the [LOCATION_002] 
Food and Drug Admini stration ( FDA ) regulations and/or the International Conference on 
Harmonization ( ICH) Good Clinical Practice ( GCP ) guideline. 
The investigator or designee must document and explain in the patients’ source documentation any deviation from the approved protocol. The investigator may implement a deviation from, or a change of, the protocol to eliminate an immediate hazard to study patients without prior IRB/IEC approval. As soon as possible after such an occurrence, the implemented deviation or change, the reasons for it, and any proposed protocol amendment(s) should be submitted to the IRB/IEC for review and approval, to the sponsor for agreement, and to the regulatory authorities, if required.

11.2 Evaluation of Efficacy 
This is study is not intended to assess efficacy, but rather the IGA is included to determine 
the need for treatment (in accord ance with the entry criteria) and subsequent re- treatment 
after the initial 8 -week course and any subsequent 4- week courses, if applicable. The IGA 
will be reported at every study visit.  
The IGA is based on a 5- point scale ranging from 0 (clear) to 4 (severe), and will be assessed 
by [CONTACT_249269]. The face, scalp, palms, soles, axillae and intertriginous areas are to be excluded in this assessment. The scores shown in Table 2 will be used to describe the severity of overall p soriasis of the 
treatable areas.

Amendment 1, Clinical Study Protocol, [ADDRESS_1032512] that has appeared or worsened during the course of the clinical trial, regardless of causal relationship to the study drug(s) under study. The collection of nonserious AEs and serious adverse events (SAEs)  should begin following the subject's 
completion of the consent process to participate in the study. 
The severity assigned to an AE should be determined by [CONTACT_85210]. 
The categories described below should be used to estimate the severity of AEs: 
• Mild:  Transient or mild discomfort; no limitation in activity; no medical 
intervention/therapy required 
• Moderate:  Mild to modera te limitation in activity; some assistance may be needed; 
no or minimal medical intervention/therapy required  
• Severe:  Marked limitation in activity; some assistance usually required; medical intervention/therapy required; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_85153]; may be incapacitating or life threatening  
The investigator should assess the relationship of the AE, if any, to the study drug as either “Related” or “Not Related”. The following should be taken into account when assessi ng SAE 
causality:  
• Positive temporal relationship to study drug, such as if the study drug was withdrawn 
and the SAE resolved or the event recurred after re introduction 
• If there is a reasonable possibility that the AE is associated with an und erlying or 
concomitant illness  
• Possible association with previous or concomitant therapy  
• No temporal relationship to the study drug and/or a more likely alternative etiology exists  
• If the AE is directly related to study procedures  or there is a lack of efficacy

 [IP_ADDRESS] Serious Adverse Events  
All AEs will be assessed as either serious or nonserious. An SAE or serious adverse reaction 
is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in death  
• Is immediately life threatening, (the term "life threatening" in the definition of 
"serious" refers to an event in which the subject is at risk of death at the time of the 
event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe)  
• Requires in patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
(hospi[INVESTIGATOR_22215] a baseline condition is not considered an AE) 
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (permanent or substantial 
disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions) 
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• Is a medically important event that may not be immediately life threatening or result 
in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the above listed outcomes 
Note: A spontaneous abortion will be considered an SAE, and must be reported to sponsor/designee within 24 hours of your awareness of the event.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Pregnancy  
All female subjects of childbearing potential must use an effective method of birth control during the course of the study and for [ADDRESS_1032513] review the following information about study participation: 
• Informed consent requirements 
• Contr aceptives in current use 
Following review of this information and appropriate subject counseling, the investigator or designee and the subject must sign the informed consent before study enrollment. 
During the study, all female subjects of childbearing potential should be instructed to contact 
[CONTACT_28265] (eg, missed or late menstrual period). 
Protocol V01- 118A -303, IDP -118 Long- term Safety Study Valeant Research & Development  
Amendment 1, Clinical Study Protocol, [ADDRESS_1032514] will be followed until the pregnancy comes to term. A Pregnancy Report form will be submitted to the sponsor/designee, initially and at the end of the pregnancy, which includes the outcome of the pregnancy and any complications occurring during the pregnancy or the delivery.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Procedures for Reporting Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
It is the responsibility of the investigator to document all AEs that occur during the course of the study. Adverse events should be documented as a single medical diagnosis. When this is not possible, the AE should be documented in terms of signs and/or symptoms observed by [CONTACT_85208].  
All AEs occurring after the subject signs the informed consent through the last study visit 
must be reported, regardless of whether or not the AEs are considered drug- related. All AEs, 
whether in response to a query, observed by [CONTACT_3991], or reported spontaneously by [CONTACT_423], will be recorded. 
At each visit during the study, the subject will be assessed for the occurrence of new and 
ongoing AEs. Cutaneous tolerability signs and symptoms that result in the subject’s requiring a concomitant therapy or discontinuation from the study will be reported as an AE. The following data will be collected on all AEs and recorded on the appropri ate CRF:  
• Event name (diagnosis preferred, if unknown, record the signs/symptoms) 
• Onset date and end date 
• Maximum intensity (severity)  
• Seriousness 
• Action taken regarding study drug 
• Corrective treatment, if given  
• Outcome 
In addition, the investigator’s assessment of causality will be recorded.  
Adverse events classified as “serious” require expeditious handling and reporting to sponsor/designee within 24 hours of site notification to comply with regulatory requirements.  
Protocol V01- 118A -303, IDP -118 Long- term Safety Study Valeant Research & Development  
Amendment 1, Clinical Study Protocol, [ADDRESS_1032515] be submitted on a written SAE report form signed by [CONTACT_19452] 24 hours of the investigator’s awareness of the event.  
The fax number fo r reporting an SAE is: 
 
 
       
    
Investigators should not wait to receive additional information to fully document the event 
before notifying Sponsor/designee of an SAE. If only limited information is initially 
available, follow up reports are required. Additional relevant information such as hospi[INVESTIGATOR_516871]/designee as soon as they are available. Should the investigator become aware of an SAE (regardless of its relationship to investigational product) that occurs within [ADDRESS_1032516] be reported in accordance with procedures specified in this protocol. 
The investigator should take all appropriate measures to ensure the safety of the subjects, 
notably he/she should follow a subject with an SAE until the event has resolved or the condition has stabilized. This may imply that follow up will continue after the subject has left the study, and that additional investigations may be requested by [CONTACT_456]. 
An AE, whether serious or nonserious, is designated unexpected (unlabeled) if it is not 
reported in the clinical safety section of the Investigator Brochure or if the event is of greater frequency, specificity or severity.  
Expedited SAE reports are those that are both unexpected based on the reference document (Investigator Brochure or Package Insert) and are related (ie, the relationship cannot be ruled out) to the study product. These expedited reports are subject to reporting timelines of 7 and/or 15 calendar days to the regulatory reporting agency(ies). Sponsor/designee will notify regulatory authorities of these AEs and all participating investigative sites in writing for investigator submission to the IRB/IEC. This notification will be in the form of a Safety Update to the Investigator Brochure (ie, “15 day letter”).  
Upon receiving such notices, the investigator must review and retain the notice with the 
Investigator Brochure and immediately submit a copy of this information to the responsible IRB/IEC according to local regulations. The investigator and IRB/IEC will determine if the informed consent requires revision. The investigator should also comply with the IRB/IEC procedures for reporting any other safety information.

Clinical laboratory analyses  (hematology and chemistry)  will be conducted on blood samples 
collected from subjects at Screening and Weeks 4, 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, and 52. All results 
will be reported, including results that are abnormal. Clinically significant results, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], should be reported as AEs. If an AE should require laboratory testing, the results of the test must be obtained by [CONTACT_754387]’s documentation. 
11.3.3 Medical History and Abbreviated Physical Examination 
A medical history will be taken at Screening, and confirmed and revised if needed, at 
Baseline. Medical histories having resolved 2 or more years before Baseline need not be 
collected unless considered relevant by [CONTACT_093].  
An abbreviated physical examination including measurements of weight and vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487], and oral temperature) will be performed at 
Baseline, and Weeks 8 , 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, and 52. Height will be measured at Baseline only.  
Any abnormal physical exam findings will be recorded. 
11.3.4 Local Skin Reactions  
Tolerability will be evaluated at baseline and all postbaseline study visits through 
assessments of selected local signs and symptoms (itching, dryness, burning/stinging). 
Additionally , at each study visit, the investigator will examine the treatment areas f or the 
presence or absence of significant known drug- related AEs  (skin atrophy, striae, 
telangiectasia, and folliculitis ). Any local skin reaction that requires the use of a concomitant 
therapy or is a cause for study drug interruption or discontinuation should be reported as an AE. The scales to be used for assessing local skin reactions are presented in Table 3.
